excessive slant of a few, stuntel firs at the
end of the house; and by a range of gaunt
thorns all stretching their limbs one way, as
if craving alms of the sun. Happily, tbe ar-
chitect had foresight to build it strong: the
narrow windows are deply set in the wall;
and the corners defended with large jutting
stones.

ornament, three gaudily painted canisters dis-

YEsrDAY afternoon set in misty and cold. I
had half a mind to spend it by my study

to Wuthering Heights.
On coming up from dinner, however, (N. B.

brushes, and coal-scuttles; and raising an in-

heaps of cinders. This spectacle drove me
back immediately; I took my hat, and, after a
four miles walk, arrived at Ileatheliff's garden
gate just in time to eseape the first feathery
flakes of a snow shover.
On that bleak hill top the earth was hard
with a black frost, and the air made me shiver
through every limb. Being unable to remove
the chain, I jumped over, and, runing up the
flagged causeway bordered with straggling
gooseberry bushes, knocked ainly for admit-

of the evening
 You should not have come out,'' she said,
rising and reaching from the chimney piece two
of the painted canisters.
Her position before was sheltered from the
light: no, I had a distinct view of her
whole figure and aountenance. She was slender,
and apparently scarcely past girlhood: an ad-
mirable for, and the most exrquisite little face
that I hnave ever had the plesure of behold-
ing : small features, very fair; flaxen ringlets,
or rather golden, hanging loose on her delicnte
neck; and eyes-had thoey been agreeable in
expression, they would have bcen irresistible-
fortunately for my susceptible heart, the only
sentiment they evinced hovered etween seorn
and a kind of desperation, singularly unnatural
to be detected there.
The canisters were almost out of her reach;
I made a motion to aid her; she turned upon
me as a miser might turn, if any one at-

She flung the tea back, spoon and all; and
resumed her chair in a, pet, her forehead cor-

like a child's, ready to cry.
Maanwhile, the young man had slung onta
his person a decidedly shabby upper garment,
and, erecting himself before the blaze, looked
down on me, from the corner of his eyes, for
all the world as if there were some mortal
feud unavenged betwveen us. I began to doubt

whether he were a serant or not ; his dress
and speech were both rude, entirely devoid of

bearishly over his cheeks, and his hands were

In tho absence of cler proofs of his con-

The whole furniture consisted of a chair, a
clothes-press, and a large oak case, with
suares cut out near the top, resembling coach
windows.
IIaving approached this astructure, I looked
inside, and perceived it to be a singular sort
of old-fashioned couch, very conveniently de
signed to obviate the necessity for every em-
ber of the family having a room to himself.
In fact, it formed a little closet, and the ledge
of a window, which it enclosed, served as a
tahle.
I alid back the panelled sides, got in with
my light, pulled then together again, and felt
secure agaiust the vigilance of Hentholiff, and
every one elee.
The ledge, wheroe I placed my cuadle, had a
few mildewed books piled up in one corner
and it was covered with writing scratched on
the paint. This writing, however, was nothing
but a name rempeated in all kinds of characters,

In vapid listlessness I leant my head against
the window, and continued spelling over
Catherine Earnshaw-Heatlcliff-Linton, till
y eyes closed; but they had not rested five
minutes when a glare of white letters started
from the dark, as vivid as spectres-the air
swarmed with Cntherines; and rousing myself
to dispel the abtrusie name, I discovered my
candle wick reclining on one of the anuique
volumes, and perfuming the place with an
odour of rosted calf-skin.
I snuffed it off, and, very ill at ease, unden
the influence of cold and lingering nausea, sat
up, and spread open the injured tome on my
knee. It was a Testament, in lean type, and
smelling dreadfully musty: a fly-leaf bore the
inseriptiou- Catherinc Earnsaw, her book,''

I shut it, and took up anothcr, and another,

it to have been well used, though not altogether
for a legitimate purpose; scarcely one chaptes
had eseaped a pen and ink commentary, at
least, the appearanee of one, covering every
morsel of blank that the printer had left.
Some were detached sentences; other parte

For a moment I econsidcred it absurd that I
should need such a wcapon to gain admittance

Now, Mr. Earnshaw did not understand
jokes from his children: he hal always been
strict and grave with them; anl Catherine, on
her part, had no idea why her father should be
crosser and less patient in his ailing condition,
than he was in his prime.
His peevish reproofs wakened in her a
naughty delight to provoke him; ehce wsas never
so happy as when we were all ecolding her at
once, and she defying us with her bold, saucy
look, and her ready worls; turning Joseph'e
religious curses into ridicule, baiting me, and
doing just what her father hated most, showing
how her pretended insolence, which he thought

real, had more power over Ieatholiff than his
kindness. How the boy would do her bidding
in anything, and his only when it suited his
own inclination.
After behaving as badly as possible all day,
she soetimes came fondling to make it up at
night.

cannot love thce; thou'rt worse than thy
brother. Go, say thy prayers, child, and ask
Godl's pardon. I doubt thy mother and I must
rue that we ever reared theel''
That made her cry, at first; and then, being
repulsed continually hardened her, and she
laughed if I told her to say she was sorry for
her faults, and beg to be forgiven.
But the hour came, at last, that ended Mr.
Earnshaw's troubles on earth. He died
quietly in his chair one Ootober evening, seated
by the fire-side.
A high wind blusterel round the house, and

stormy, yet it was not cold, and we were all
together-I, a little removed fromn the hearth,
busy at my knitting, and Joseph reading his
Bible near the table, (for tho servants generally
sat in the house then, after their work was
done.) Mies Cathy had been sick, and that
made her still; she leant against her father's
knee, and Hentholiff was lying on the floor
with his head in hor lap.
I remember the master, boefore he fell intoa
doze, stroking her bonny hair-it pleased him
rarely to see her gentle-and saying-
 WYhy canst thou not always be a good
lass, Cathy '
And she turned her face up to his, and
lghed, and answered,

she kissed his hand, and said she would sing

I joined my wail to theirs, loud and bitter;

He told me to put on rmy cloak and run to
Gimmerton for the doctor and the parson. I
could not guess the use that either would be
of, then. However, I went, through wind and
rain, and brought one, the doctor, baek with
me; the other said he would come in the
morning.
Leaving oseph to explain mattere, I ran
to the children's room; their door was ajar, I
saw they had never laid down, though it was
ast midnight; but thcy were calmer, and did
not need me to coneale them. The little souls
were comforting each other with better
tloughts than I could have hit on; no parson
in the world ever pictured Heaen so beauti-

while I sobbed, and listened, I could not help

I thought she was half silly from her be-

I should havo been dressing the children; and
there she sat shivering and cluasping her hands,

She expressed pleasure, tao, nt finding a

prattled to Catherine, and kissed hcr, and ran
about with her, and gave her qunntities of

tired very soon, howeer, and when she grew

words from her, evincing a tdislike to Heath-

hatred of the boy. He drove him from theit
company to the servants, deprived him of the
instruetions of the curate, and insisted tbat he
should labour ont of doors instead, copelling
him to do so, as hard as any other lad on the

One Sunday evening, it chanced that they

We searched the honse, above and below,

bolt the doors, and swore nobody should let

I could not half tell what an infernal house
we had. The curate dropped cualling, and no-
body decent came near us, at last; unless,
Edgar Linton's vi-its to Miss Cnthy might
be an exeeption. At fifteen she was the
queen of the contry-side; she had no peer:
and she did turn out a haughty, headstrong
creaturel I own I did not like her, after her
infaney was past; and I vexed her frequently
y trying to bring down hoer arrogance; she
never took an aversion to me though. She
had a wondrous constancey to old attachments;
even Heathcliff kept his hold on her nffeetions
unalterahly, and young Linton, with all his
superiority, found it difficult to make an
equally deep impression.

I descended and found Heatheliff waiting
under the porch, evidently anticipating an in-

without waste of words, and I ushered him
into the presence of the master and mistress,
whose flushed cheeks betrayed signs of warm
talkiog. But the lady's glowed with another
feeling when her fricnd appearel at the door;
she sprng forward, took both his hands, and
led him to Linton: and then she seized Lin-
ton's reluctant fingers and crushed them into
his.
Now fully reealed by the fire and candloe-
light, I was amazed, more than ever, to hehold
the transformation of Heatheliff. He had
grown a tall, nthletic, well-formed man; be-
side whom, my master seemed quite slender
and youth-like. His upright carriage sug-
gested the idea of his having been in the army.

His countenance was much older in expression,
and decision of fenture than Mr. Linton's; it
looked intclligent, and retained no marks of
former degradation. A half-civilized ferocity
lurkel yet in the depressed brows, and eyes
full of black fire, but it was subdued; and his
manner was even dignified, quite divested of
roughness though too stern for grace

that I shall have more opportunities of seeing

He would have recoiled still more had he
been aware that her attachment rose unsoli-

I came to a stone where the highsay

a rough sand-pillar, with the letters W. I.

WurE MIiss Linton moped about the park and
garden, always silent, and almost alay in
tears; and her brother shut himself up among
books that he never opened; earying,l

that Catherine, repenting her conduct, would

to cast himself at her feet; I went about ny
houeehold duties, convinceed that the Grange
had but one sensible soul in its walls, and that
lodged in y body.
I wasted no condolences on miss, nor any
exposetulations on my mistress, nor did l pay
attention to the sighs of my master who
yearned to hear his lady's name, since he might
not hear her voice.
I determined they should come about as
they pleased for me; and though it was a tire-
somely slow proeess, I began to rejoice at
length in a faint dawn of its progress, as I
thought at first.
MIre. Linton, on tho third dy, unbarred her
door; and having finished the water in her
pitcher and deecanter, desired arenewed supply,
and a basin of gruel, for she believed she was
dying. That I set down as a speech meant
for Edgar's ears, I believed no sueh thing, so
I kept it to myself, and brought her some tea
and dry toast.

Fon two months the fugitives remained absent,

and conquered the worst shock of what was
denominated n brain fever. No mother could
hae nursed an only child more devotedly than
Edgar tended hcer. Day and night, he was

reason could inflict: and, though Ienneth re-

that his henlth and strength were bcing sacri-
ficed to preserve a mcre ruin of humanity, he

Catherine's life was declared ont of danger;

The first time she left her chambcr, was at

WVo knew she was reall better, and there-

it might be partially removed by a change of

The master told me to light a fire in the
many-week's deserted parlour, and to set an
easy-chair in the sunshine by the window;
ani then he brought her down, and she sat a
long while enjoying the genial heat, and, as
we expected, revived by the objects round her,
which, though familiar, were free fromn the
lreary associations investing her hated sick-
chamber. By evening, she seeaed greatly ex-
hausted; yet no arguments could persuade her
to return to that apartment, and I had to ar-
range the parlour sofa for her bed, till another
room could be prepared.
To obviate the fatigue of mounting and de-
scending the astairs, we fitted up this, where

Ah, I thought myself, she might recover,
Bo waited on as she was. And there was dou-
ble cause to desire it, for on her existence de-
pended that of another; we cherished the hope
that in a little while, MIr. Linton's heart would
be gladdened, and his lands secured from a
atranger's gripe, by the birth of an heir.
I sloull mention that Isabella sent to her
brother, same six weeks from her departure a
short note, announcing her marriage with
Heathecliff. It appeared dry and cold; but at
the bottom, was dotted in with pcneil, an ob-
scure apology, and an entreaty for kind remem-
branee, and reconciliation, if her proceeding
had offended him; asserting that she could not
help it then, and being done, she bad now nu
power to repeal it.
Linton did not reply to this, I beliove; aud,

CHAPTER XIV.
As soon as I had perused this epistle, I went to
the master, and informed him that his sister
had arrived at the Heights, and sent me a
a letter expreseing her aorrow for Mrs. Linton'a
situation, and her ardent desire to see him;
with a wish that he would transmit to her, as
early as possible, some token of forgiveness by
me.
 Forgiveness ' snid Linton.  I have
nothing to forgive her, Ellen-you may cnll at
Wuthering Heights this afternoon, if youlike,

and say that lIL am not angry, but Im sorry to
have lost her: especially as lI can neer think
she'll be happy. It is out of the qucstion my
going to see her, however; we are eternally
livided; and should she really wish to oblige
me, let ber persuade the villain she has ar-
ried to lenve the country.''
And you wont write her a little note,

 No,'' ho answered.  It is needless. Mly
communication with Heathcliff'a faily shall
be as sparing as his with mine. It shall not

MIr. IEdgar's coldness deprcssed me exceed-
ingly; and all the way from the Grange, I
puzzled my brains how to put more heart into
what he said, when I repeated it; and how to
soften his refusal of even a few lincs to con-
sole Ieabella.
I dare say she hal been on thao watch for
me since morning: lI saw hcr lookiaog througl

and I nodded to her; but she drew back, as if
afraidl of being observed.
I entered without knocking. There neves
was such a dreary, dismal scene as tle formerly
cheerful house presented1 I must confess
that, if I had beon in the young ladys plaee,
I would, at least, hae swept the hearth, and
wiped the tables with a duster. But she al-
ready partook of the pervading spirit of negleet
which encoupassed her. Her pretty face was
wan and listless; her hair uncurled; some
locks langing lankly dow, and some care-
lessly twisted round her head. Probbly shc
had not touched her dress since yester evening.
Hindley was not there. Mr. Heathcliff sat
at a table, turning over some papers in his
pocket-book ; but he rose when I appeared,
asked me how I did, quite friendly, and offered
mc a chair.

stranger as a born and bred gentleman, and his
wife as a thorough little slatternl
She eame forward eagerly to greet me; and
held out one hand to take the expected letter.
I shook my head. She wouldu't under-
stand the hint, but followed me to a sile-
bord, where I went to lay my bonnet, and
importuned me in a whisper to give her di-
rectly hat I had brought.
Heathcliff' gue-sed the meaning of her
manuvres, and said-
 If youn hae got anything for Isabella, as
no doubt you have, Nelly, give it to her. You
eedn't make a secret of it; we have no secrets
between us,''
Oh, I have nothing,'' I replied, thinking
it best to speak the truth at once.  My
master bid e tell his sister that sho must not
expnect either a letter or a visit from him at
present. He sends his loe, ma'am, and his
wishes for your happiness, and his parlon for

that after this time, his household, and the
household here, should drop intercommunica-

it up.
Mrs. Ienthcliff's lip quivered slightly, and
she returned to her seat in the window. 1ler
husband took his stand on the hearthstone,
near me, and began to put questions concern-
ing Catherine.
I told hi as much as I thought proper of
her illness, and he extorted from me, by cross-
exarination, most of the facts connected with
its origin.
I blamed her, as she deserved, for bringing
it all on herself; and ended by hoping that he
would follow MIr. Linton's exaple, and avoid
future interference with his farily, for good or
evil.
tMIr.s Linton is now just recovering,'' I
said, ``she'll never be like she as, but her
life is spared, and if you renlly have a regard
for her, you'll shun crossing her way agaiu.

ANoTHR week over- and I am so many day

all my neighbour's history, at different sitting

In the evening,'' she said, `' the evening
of my visit to the Heights, I knew as well as
if I sasw him, that MIr. IIeathclif was aboat
the place; anl I shunned going out, because 1
still carried his letter in my pocket, and didn't
wnt to be threntened, or teased any more.
I had mnade up my mind not to give it till
my master went somewhere; as I could not
guess how its receipt would affeet Catherine.
Tho consequence was, that it did not reach
her before the lapse of three days. The fourth
was Sunny, and I brought it into her room.
nfter the family were gone to church.
There was a man servant left to keep the
house with me, and we generally made a prac-
tice of locking the doors during the hours of
service; but on that occasion, the weather was
so warm and pleasant that I set them wide
opcn; and to fulfil my engegement, as l knew
ho would be coming, I told my coupanion
that the mistress wished very much for some
oranges, and ho must run over to the villge,

and get a few, to be piid for on the morrow.
He departed, and I went up-stairs.
Mrs. Linton sat in a loose, white dress,
with a light shawl over her shoulders, in the
recess of tho open window, as usual. Hcr
thick, long hair had been partly removed at
the begining of her illness: and now, she
wore it simply combed in its natural tresscs
over her temples and neock. Her appearance
was altered, as l had told Heathcliff, but when
she was calm, there seemed unearthly beauty
in the change.
The flash of her eyes had been suecceeded by
a deamy and melancholy softness: they na
longer gave the impression of looking at the
objects around her; they appeared always to
gaze beyond, and far beyond-you would lave
said out of this world-Then, tle paleness of

who saw her, I should think, refuted more tan-
gible proofs of convalescence and stmped her
as one doomed to decay.
A book lasy spreal on the sill before her, and
the scarcely perceptible wind fluttered ite
leaves at intervals. I believe Liunton had
Iaid it thore, for she never endeavoured to
divert herself with resding, or occupation of
any kind; and be would spend many an houn
in trying to entice her attention to some sub-
jeot which had formerly been her amusement
She was conscious of his aim, and in her
better moods, endured his efforts placidly; only
slowing their uselessness by now and then
uppressing a wearied sigh, ane cheeking him
at lst, with the saddest of smiles and kisses.
At otler times, she would turn petulantly
away, and hide cr fuace in her hands, or even
push lim off angrily; and then he took care
to let her alone, for he was certain of doing
no good.

sensitive was his nversion, that he efrained
from going anywherc where hoe was likely ta
see or hear of Heathcliff. Grief, and that to-
gether, transformed him into a complete her-

ceased even to attend church, avoided the vil-
lage on all oceasions, and spent a life of entire
seclusion within the limits of his park and
grounds: only varied by solitary rambles on
the moors, and visits to the grave of his wife,
mostly at evening, or enrly moring, before
other wanderers were abroad.
But he was too good to be thoroughly un-

It was named Catherine, but he ncer called

with her; and his attachren sprang from its
relation to her, far more than from its being
his own.
I nsed to draw a compurison between him,
and Hindley Earnshuaw and perplex myself to
explain satisfactorily, why theic conduct was
so opposite in similar circumstancees. They
had both been fond husbands, and were both

My master hesitated not a moment in com-

orders that she must not wander out of the
park, even under my escort; he did not calcu-
late on her going unaccompanied.
He was away three weeks: the first day or

too sad for either reading or playing: in that
quiet state she caused me little trouble; but it
as succeeded by an interval of impatient,
fretful eariness; and being too busy, and too

spent in reeounting her fanciful tales. I did

and such passionate tears and lamentations
followed the news of his departure, that Ed-

firming he should come back soon; he added,
however,  if I can get him;'' and there were
no hopes of that.
This promiae poorly pacified her; but time

his features had waxed so dim in her memory
that she did not recognise him.
When I chanced to encounter the house-
keeper of Wuthering IHIeights, in paying busi-
ness-visits to Gimmerton, I used to ask how
the young master got on; for he lived almost
as secluded as Catherine herself, and was nevetr
to be seen. I could gather from her that he
continued in weaks henlth, and was a tiresome
inmate. She said MIr. Heathcliff' seemed ta
dislike him ever longer and worse, though hc
took some trouble to conceal it. IIe hal an
antiathy to the sound of his voice, and could
not do at all with his sitting in the same roon
ith him many minutes together.
There seldom passed mch talkc bhetween
them; Linton lernt his lessons, and spent hi
evenings in a small apartment, they callcl the
parlour; or else lay in bed all day; for he
was constantly getting coughs, and colds, and
aches, and pains of some sort.

I divined, from this account, that utter lask
of sympathy had rendered young Heatheliff
selfish and disagreeable, if he wcre not sa

with a sense of grief at his lot, and a wvish

Time wore on at the Grange in its fore
pleasant way, till Miss Cathy reached sixteen.
On the anniversary of her birth we never
manifested any signs of rejoiing, because it
was, also, the anniversary of my late mistress's
death. Her father invariably spent that day
alone in the library; and walked, at dusk, a
far as Gimmerton kirkyard, where he would
frequently prolong his stay beyond midnight.
Therefore Catherine was thrown on her own
resources for amusement.
This twentieth of March as a beautiful
spriog day, and wken her father had retired,
my young lady came down dressed for going
out, and said she had asked to have a ramble
on the edge of the moors with me; and MIr.
Linton had given her leave, if we went only a
short distance, and were back within the hour.

I put on my bonnet, and snllied out;
thinking othing more of the matter. She
bounded before me, and returned to my side,
and was off again like a young greyhounl;
and, at first, I found plenty of entertainment
in listening to the larks singing far and near;
and enjoying the sweet, warm sunshine; and
watching hes, my pet, and my delight, with
her golden ringlets flying loose behind, and her

She also got a trick of coming down early

She went sadly on; there was no running

I gazed round for a means of diverting her

on the first occasion of my sitting up in the

The man took his ocharge stealthily across
the grass towards the stable. Cathy entered
by the oasement-window of the drawing-room,
and glided noieelessly up to where I awaited

She put the door gently to, slipped off her
asnowy shoes, untied her hat, and was proceed-

she uttered an inarticulate exsclamation, and
stood fixed.

to put ber backs in the stabhle; you mustn't

by half-past six, and generally stayed till half-

expected there would be sad work persuading
you tolet me keep my word to Linton, for I
had engaged to call again next day, when we
quitted him; but, as you stayed up stairs on

with him about the pony. He is fond of read-

I preferred giving him my own, and that satis-

kissed each other and were friends. After
sitting still an hour, I looked at the great

thought how nice it would be to play in, if we
removed the table; nnd I asked Linton to call

Edgar Linton's state. The havoe that onths

the inroads of hours.
Catherine, we waonuld fin have deluded, yet,

stopped a short time daily-the brief period he
could bear to sit up, and his chamber had be-

he flattered himself would be a happy change
of scene and society, draving comfort froa the
hoe tbat she would not now be left entirely
alone after his death.
He had a fixed idea, I guessed by several

him in mind; for Linton's letters bore few,
or no indications of his defeetive character

Catherine's face was just like the landscape

and the sunehine was more transient, and her
poor little heart reproached itself for even that
passing forgetfulness of its cares

Heathelif' had the key in his hand that re-

Catherine pushed another to him, and wiped

composure, since he was no longer in terror for
himself. The anguish he had exhibited on the
moor subsided as soon as ever he entered

menaced with an awful visitation of wrath, if
he failed in decoying us tbere; al, that ac-

1802.-This September, I was invited to de-

and, on my journey to his abode, I nexpeot-

The hostler, at a roadside public-house, was
holding a pail of water to refresh my horses,
when a cart of very green oats, newly reaped,

A sudden impulse seized me to visit Thrueh-

conceived that I might as well pass the night
under my own roof, as in an inn. Besides, I
could spare a day enasily, to arrange matters
with my landlord, and thus save myself thc
trouble of invadiog the neighbourhood again.
Having rested a while, I directed my servant
to ingquire the way to the village; and, with
great fatigue to our beasts, we managed the
distance in some three hours.
I loft him there, and proceeded down the
valley alone. The grey church loked greyer
anl the lonely churchyard lonelier. I di-tin-

waste a month among its solitudes. In winter,
nothing more dreary, in summer, nothing
more divine, than those glens shut in hy hills,
and those bluff, bold swells of heath.
I reached the Grange before sunset, and
knocked for admittance; but the family had re-
treated into the back premises, I judged by one
thin, blue wreath curling from thc kitchen
chimey, and they did not hear.
