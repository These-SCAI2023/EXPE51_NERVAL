by O
any O

only O

V. I-LAW

In O
the O
course O
of O
time O
, O
Mr. O
Earnshaw B-PERSON
began O
to O
|
| O
fail O
. O
He O
had O
been O
active O
and O
healthy O
, O
yet O
his O
|
| O
strength O
left O
him O
suddenly O
  O
and O
when O
he O
was O
|
| O
confined O
to O
the O
chimney O
- O
corner O
he O
grew O
griev- O
|

ously O
irritable O
. O
A O
nothing O
vexed O
him O
, O
and O
|
| O
suspected O
slights O
of O
his O
authority O
nearly O
threw O
|
| O
him O
into O
fits O

|

This O
was O
especially O
to O
be O
remarked O
if O
any O

to O
impose O
upon O
, O

domineer O

over O
his O
favourite O
: O
he O
was O

seeming O
to O
have O
got O
into O
his O
head O
the O
notion O

that O
, O
because O
he O
liked O
Heathcliff B-ORG

all O
hated O

longed O
to O
do O
him O

ill O

It O
was O
a O

humoured O

eager O

join O
her O
