I O
had O
half B-CARDINAL

saw O
a O

surrounded O
by O

coal O
- O
scuttles O

raising O

the O

drove O
me O
back O

                        | O
I O
took O

On O

hard O

black O
frost O
, O
and O
the O
air O

                        | O
made O
me O
shiver O
through O
every O
limb O
. O
Being O
unable O
to O
remove O
the O
chain O
, O
I O

                        | O
jumped O

, O
running O

with O
straggling O

                        | O

the O

howled O

  | O
" O
Wretched O

" O
I O
ejaculated O
, O
mentally O

" O

the O

                        | O
evinced O
hovered O
between O

kind O
of O

singularly O

unnatural O

The O

almost O
out O

over O

She O
flung O

all O
  O
and O
resumed O

her O

whether O

entirely O
devoid O

thick O

brown O
curls O

still O

his O

was O

In O
the O

deemed O
it O

from O

I O
heard O
another O
specimen O
of O
their O
civil O
behaviour O
amongst O

At O

the O

" O

" O
You O

him O

exclaimed O
his O
master O
, O
or O
whatever O
relation O
he O

                        | O

" O

" O

" O
A O

Mrs. O

more O

" O
Not O

Zillah B-PERSON

the O
stout O

at O

forth O

                        | O
nature O
of O
the O
uproar O

thought O
that O

With O
these O
words O
she O
suddenly O
splashed O
a O
pint O
of O
icy O
water O
down O
my O
neck O
, O
and O

                        | O
pulled O

merriment O

quickly O
in O
his O
habitual O
moroseness O
. O

  | O
I O
was O
sick O
exceedingly O
, O
and O
dizzy O
and O
faint O
  O
and O
thus O
compelled O
, O
perforce O
, O
to O

                        | O
accept O
lodgings O

me O
a O
glass O
of O
brandy O
, O

                        | O
and O
then O
passed O
on O
to O
the O
inner O
room O
, O

she O
condoled O
with O
me O
on O
my O
sorry O

predicament O

CHAPTER O
III O
. O
| 
  | O
While O
leading O
the O
way O
up O
- O
stairs O
, O
she O
recommended O
that O
I O
should O
hide O
the O
|
                        | O
candle O
, O
and O
not O
make O
a O
noise O
, O
for O
her O
master O
had O
an O
odd O
notion O
about O
the O
|
                        | O
chamber O
she O
would O
put O
me O
in O
  O
and O
never O
let O
anybody O
lodge O
there O
|
                        | O
willingly O
. O
| 
  | O
I O
asked O
the O
reason O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
did O
not O
know O
, O
she O
answered O
  O
she O
had O
only O
lived O
there O
a O
year O
or O
two B-CARDINAL
  O
and O
|
                        | O
they O
had O
so O
many O
queer O
goings O
on O
, O
she O
could O
not O
begin O
to O
be O
curious O
. O
| 
  | O
fastened O
my O
door O
and O
|
                        | O
glanced O
round O
for O
the O
bed O
. O
The O
whole O
furniture O
consisted O
of O
a O
chair O
, O
a O
|
                        | O
clothes O
- O
press O
, O
and O
a O
large O
oak O
case O
, O
with O
squares O
cut O
out O
near O
the O
top O
, O
|
                        | O
resembling O
coach O
windows O
. O
| 
  | O
Having O
approached O
this O
structure O
, O
I O
looked O
inside O
, O
and O
perceived O
it O
to O
be O
a O
|
                        | O
singular O
sort O
of O
old O
- O
fashioned O
couch O
, O
very O
conveniently O
designed O
to O
obviate O
|
                        | O
the O
necessity O
for O
every O
member O
of O
the O
family O
having O
a O
room O
to O
himself O
. O
In O

it O
formed O
a O
little O
closet O
, O
and O
the O

of O
a O
window O
, O
which O
it O
|
                        | O
enclosed O
, O
served O
as O
a O
table O
. O
| 
  | O
I O
slid O
back O
the O
panelled O
sides O
, O
got O
in O
with O
my O
light O
, O
pulled O
them O
together O
|
                        | O
again O
, O
and O
felt O
secure O
against O
the O
vigilance O
of O

In O

he O
kissed O
his O

good O

set O
off O

days B-DATE
of O
his O

absence O
— O
and O
often O
did O
little O
Cathy B-PERSON
ask O
when O
he O
would O
be O
home O
: O
Mrs. O
Earnshaw B-PERSON
, O

                        | O
expected O
him O
by O
supper O

on O
the O

hour O
after O

there O
were O
no O

, O
and O
at O
last O
the O

                        | O
children O
got O
tired O
of O
running O
down O
to O
the O

to O
look O
— O
Then O
it O
grew O
dark O
, O
|
                        | O
she O
would O
have O
had O
them O
to O

, O
but O
they O
begged O
sadly O
to O
be O
allowed O
to O
stay O

                        | O
up O

, O
just B-TIME
about I-TIME
eleven I-TIME
o'clock I-TIME

the O

was O
raised O
quietly O

in O

                        | O
stept O
the O
master O
. O
He O
threw O
himself O
into O
a O
chair O
, O
laughing O
and O
groaning O
, O
and O
|
                        | O
bid O
them O
all O
stand O
off O
, O
for O
he O
was O
nearly O
killed O
— O
he O
would O
not O
have O
such O

                        | O
another O
walk O
for O
the O

at O
the O
end O
of O
it O

be O
flighted O

he O
said O
opening O
his O
great O

coat O
, O
which O
he O

up O

beaten O

it O
as O

gift O
of O
God O

it O

as O

almost O
as O
if O
it O
came O
from O
the O
devil O

" O
| 
  | O
We O
crowded O
round O
, O
and O
, O
over O
Miss O
Cathy B-PERSON
's O
head O
, O
I O
had O
a O
peep O
at O
a O

                        | O
dirty O
, O
ragged O
, O
black O

haired O
child O
  O
big O
enough O
both O
to O
walk O

talk O
— O
indeed O
, O

                        | O
its O
face O
looked O
older O
than O
Catherine's O
— O
yet O
, O
when O
it O
was O
set O
on O
its O
feet O
, O
it O
|
                        | O
only O
stared O
round O
, O
and O
repeated O
over O
and O
over O
again O
, O
some O
gibberish O
that O
|
                        | O
nobody O
could O
understand O
. O
I O
was O
frightened O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Earnshaw B-PERSON
was O
ready O
to O
|
                        | O
fling O
it O
out O
of O
doors O
: O
she O
did O
fly O
up O
— O
asking O
how O
he O
could O
fashion O
to O
bring O
|
                        | O
that O
gipsy O
brat O
into O
the O
house O
, O
when O
they O
had O
their O
own O
bairns O
to O
feed O
, O
and O
|
                        | O
fend O
for O
? O
What O
he O
meant O
to O
do O
with O
it O
, O
and O
whether O
he O
were O
mad O
? O

time O
, O
being O
both O
|
                        | O
limited O
, O
he O
thought O
it O
better O
, O
to O
take O
it O
home O
with O
him O
, O
at O
once O

                        | O
into O
vain O
expences O
there O
  O

not O
leave O
as O
he O

                        | O
found O
it O
. O
| 
  | O
Well O
, O
the O
conclusion O
was O
that O
my O
mistress O
grumbled O
herself O
calm O
  O
and O
Mr O
|
                        | O
Earnshaw B-PERSON
told O
me O
to O
wash O
it O
, O

give O
it O
clean O
things O

let O
it O
sleep O
with O

the O
children O

| 
  | O
Hindley B-PERSON
and O
Cathy B-PERSON
contented O
themselves O
with O
looking O
and O
listening O
till O
peace O

                        | O
was O
restored O
: O
then O
, O
both O
began O
searching O
their O
father O
's O
pockets O
for O
the O
|
                        | O
presents O
he O
had O
promised O
them O
. O
The O
former O
was O
a O
boy O
of O
fourteen B-DATE
, O
but O
when O
he O
|
                        | O
drew O
out O
, O
what O
had O
been O
a O
fiddle O
crushed O
to O
morsels O
in O
the O
great O
coat O
, O
he O

                        | O
blubbered B-PERSON
aloud O
, O
and O
Cathy B-PERSON
, O
when O
she O
learnt O
the O
master O
had O
lost O
her O

in O

                        | O
attending O
on O
the O
stranger O

showed O
her O
humour O
by O
grinning O
and O
spitting O
at O
the O

                        | O
stupid O
little O
thing O

earning O
for O
her O
pains O
, O
a O
sound O
blow O
from O
her O
father O

them O

even O
in O

                        | O
their O
room O
, O
and O
I O
had O
no O
more O
sense O
, O
so O
, O
I O
put O
it O
on O
the O
landing O
of O
the O

                        | O
stairs O

hoping O

might O
be O
gone O
on O
the O
morrow B-DATE

By O
chance O
, O
or O
else O
attracted O

by O
hearing O
his O
voice O
, O
it O
crept O
to O
Mr. O
Earnshaw B-PERSON

door O
and O
there O
he O
found O
it O

                        | O
on O
quitting O
his O
chamber O

Inquiries O

there O
  O
I O
was O

                        | O
obliged O
to O
confess O

and O
in O
recompense O
for O
my O
cowardice O

inhumanity O
was O

                        | O
sent O
out O
of O
the O
house O

  | O
This O
was O
Heathcliff B-PERSON

first B-ORDINAL
introduction O
to O
the O
family O
: O
on O
coming O
back O

few I-DATE

                        | I-DATE
days I-DATE
afterwards O
, O
for O
I O
did O
not O
consider O
my O
banishment O
perpetual O
, O
I O
found O
|
                        | O
they O
had O
christened O
him O
" O
Heathcliff B-PERSON
, O
" O
it O
was O
the O
name O
of O
a O
son O
who O
died O
in O
|
                        | O
childhood O
, O
and O
it O
has O
served O
him O
ever O
since O
, O
both O
for O
christian B-NORP
and O

                        | O
surname O
. O
| 
  | O
never O
put O
in O
a O
word O
on O
his O
behalf O
, O
when O
she O
saw O
him O
wronged O
. O
| 
  | O
He O
seemed O
a O
sullen O
, O
patient O
child O
  O
hardened O
, O
perhaps O
, O
to O
ill O
- O
treatment O
: O
he O
|
                        | O
would O
stand O
Hindley B-PERSON
's O
blows O
without O
winking O
or O
shedding O
a O
tear O
, O
and O
my O
|
                        | O
pinches O
moved O
him O
only O
to O
draw O
in O
a O
breath O
, O
and O
open O
his O
eyes O
as O
if O
he O
had O
|
                        | O
hurt O
himself O
by O
accident O
, O
and O
nobody O
was O
to O
blame O
. O
| 
  | O
This O
endurance O
made O
old O
Earnshaw B-PERSON
furious O
when O
he O
discovered O
his O
son O

                        | O
persecuting O
the O
poor O
, O

called O
him O

took O
to O

Heathcliff B-PERSON
strangely O
, O
believing O
, O
all O

said O
, O
( O
for O

, O
he O
said O

precious O
little O
, O
and O
generally O
the O

him O
up O
far O
above O

                        | O
Cathy B-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
too O
mischievous O
and O
wayward O
for O
a O
favourite O
. O
| 
  | O
his O
father O
as O
an O
oppressor O
rather O
|
                        | O
than O
a O
friend O
, O
and O
Heathcliff B-PERSON
as O
a O
usurper O
of O
his O
parent O
's O
aflfections O
, O
and O
|
                        | O
his O
privileges O
, O
and O
he O
grew O
bitter O
with O
brooding O
over O
these O
injuries O
. O
| 
  | O
I O
sympathised O
awhile O
, O
but O
, O
when O
the O
children O
fell O
ill O
of O
the O
measles O
and O
I O
|
                        | O
had O
to O
tend O
them O
, O
and O
take O
on O
me O
the O
cares O
of O
a O
woman O
, O
at O
once O
, O
I O
changed O
my O
|
                        | O
ideas O
. O
Heathcliff B-PERSON
was O
dangerously O
sick O
, O
and O
while O
he O
lay O
at O
the O
worst O
he O
|
                        | O
would O
have O
me O
constantly O
by O
his O
pillow O
  O
I O
suppose O
he O
felt O
I O
did O
a O
good O
deal O
|
                        | O
for O
him O
, O
and O
he O
had'nt O
wit O
to O
guess O
that O
I O
was O
compelled O
to O
do O
it O
. O
However O
, O
|
                        | O
I O
will O
say O
this O
, O
he O
was O
the O
quietest O
child O
that O
ever O
nurse O
watched O
over O
. O
The O
|
                        | O
difference O
between O
him O
and O
the O
others O
forced O
me O
to O
be O
less O
partial O
: O
Cathy B-PERSON
|
                        | O
and O
her O
brother O
harassed O
me O
terribly O
: O
|  | O
he O
|  | O
was O
as O
uncomplaining O
as O
a O
|
                        | O
lamb O
  O
though O
hardness O
, O
not O
gentleness O
, O
made O
him O
give O
little O
trouble O
. O
| 
  | O
praised O
me O
for O
my O
care O
. O
I O
was O
vain O
of O
his O
commendations O
, O
|
                        | O
and O
softened O
towards O
the O
being O
by O
whose O
means O
, O
I O
earned O
them O
, O
and O
thus O
|
                        | O
Hindley B-PERSON
lost O
his O
last O
ally O
  O
still O
I O
could O
n't O
dote O
on O
Heathcliff B-PERSON
, O
and O
I O
|
                        | O
wondered O
often O
what O
my O
master O
saw O
to O
admire O
so O
much O
in O
the O
sullen O
boy O
who O
|
                        | O
never O
, O
to O
my O
recollection O
, O
repaid O
his O
indulgence O
by O
any O
sign O
of O
gratitude O
. O
|
                        | O
He O
was O
not O
insolent O
to O
his O
benefactor O
  O
he O
was O
simply O
insensible O
, O
though O

                        | O
knowing O
perfectly O
the O
hold O
he O
had O
on O
his O
heart O
, O
and O
conscious O
he O
had O
only O
to O
|
                        | O
speak O
and O
all O
the O
house O
would O
be O
obliged O
to O
bend O
to O
his O
wishes O

As O

Earnshaw B-PERSON
once O
bought O
a O
couple O
of O
colts O
at O
the O
|
                        | O
parish O
fair O
, O
and O
gave O
the O
lads O
each O
one O
. O
Heathcliff B-PERSON
took O
the O
handsomest O
, O
but O
|
                        | O
it O
soon O
fell O
lame O
, O
and O
when O
he O
discovered O
it O
, O
he O
said O
to O
Hindley B-PERSON
, O
| 
  | O
given O
me O
|
                        | O
this B-DATE
week I-DATE
, O
and O
show O
him O
my O
arm O
which O
is O
black O
to O
the O
shoulder O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Hindley B-PERSON
put O
out O
his O
tongue O
, O
and O
cuffed O
him O
over O
the O
ears O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
You O
'd O
better O
do O
it O
, O
at O
once O
, O
" O
he O
persisted O
escaping O
to O
the O
porch O
, O
( O
they O
were O
|
                        | O
in O
the O
stable O
) O
" O
you O
will O
have O
to O
, O
and O
, O
if O
I O
speak O
, O
of O
these O
blows O
, O
you O
'll O
|
                        | O
get O
them O
again O
with O
interest O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Off O
dog O
! O
" O
cried O
Hindley B-PERSON
, O
threatening O
him O
with O
an O
iron O
weight O
, O
used O
for O
|
                        | O
weighing O
potatoes O
, O
and O
hay O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Throw O
it O
, O
" O
he O
replied O
, O
standing O
still O
, O
" O
and O
then O
I O
'll O
tell O
how O
you O
boasted O
|
                        | O
that O
you O
would O
turn O
me O
out O
of O
doors O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
died O
, O
and O
see O
whether O
he O
|
                        | O
will O
not O
turn O
you O
out O
directly O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
his O
condition O
plead O
for O
him O
, O
intimating O
who O
had O
caused O
it O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Take O
my O
colt O
, O
gipsy B-PERSON
, O
then O
! O
" O
said O
young O
Earnshaw B-PERSON
, O
" O
And O
I O
pray O
that O
he O
may O
|
                        | O
break O
your O
neck O
, O
take O
him O
, O
and O
be O
damned O
, O
you O
beggarly O
interloper O
! O
and O
|
                        | O
wheedle O
my O
father O
out O
of O
all O
he O
has O
, O
only O
, O
afterwards O
, O
show O
him O
what O
you O
|
                        | O
are O
, O
imp O
of O
Satan B-PERSON
— O
And O
take O
that O
, O
I O
hope O
he O
'll O
kick O
out O
your O
brains O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
Heathcliff B-PERSON
had O
gone O
to O
loose O
the O
beast O
, O
and O
shift O
it O
to O
his O
own O
stall O
— O
He O
was O
|
                        | O
passing O
behind O
it O
, O
when O
Hindley B-PERSON
finished O
his O
speech O
by O
knocking O
him O
under O
|
                        | O
its O
feet O
, O
and O
without O
stopping O
to O
examine O
whether O
his O
hopes O
were O
fulfilled O
, O
|
                        | O
ran O
away O
as O
fast O
as O
he O
could O
. O
| 
  | O
I O
was O
surprised O
to O
witness O
how O
coolly O
the O
child O
gathered O
himself O
up O
, O
and O
went O
|
                        | O
on O
with O
his O
intention O
, O
exchanging O
saddles O
and O
all O
  O
and O
then O
sitting O
down O
on O
|
                        | O
a O
bundle O
of O
hay O
to O
overcome O
the O
qualm O
which O
the O
violent O
blow O
occasioned O
, O
|
                        | O
before O
he O
entered O
the O
house O
. O

  | O
blame O
of O
his O
bruises O
on O
|
                        | O
the O
horse O
  O
he O
minded O
little O
what O
tale O
was O
told O
since O
he O
had O
what O
he O
wanted O
. O
|
                        | O
He O
complained O
so O
seldom O
, O
indeed O
, O
of O
such O
stirs O
as O
these O
, O
that O
I O
really O
|
                        | O
thought O
him O
not O
vindictive O
— O
I O
was O
deceived O

completely O

as O
you O

CHAPTER O
V. O
| 
  | O
In O
the O
course O
of O
time O
, O
Mr. O
Earnshaw B-PERSON
began O
to O
fail O
. O
He O
had O
been O
active O
and O
|
                        | O
healthy O
, O
yet O
his O
strength O
left O
him O
suddenly O
  O
and O
when O
he O
was O
confined O
to O
the O
|
                        | O
chimney O
- O
corner O
he O
grew O
grievously O
irritable O
. O
A O
nothing O
vexed O
him O
, O
and O
|
                        | O
suspected O
slights O
of O
his O
authority O
nearly O
threw O
him O
into O
fits O
. O
| 
  | O
seeming O
to O
have O
got O
into O
his O
head O
the O
|
                        | O
notion O
that O
, O
because O
he O
liked O
Heathcliff B-PERSON
, O
all O
hated O
, O
and O
longed O
to O
do O
him O
an O
|
                        | O
ill O
- O
turn O
. O
| 
  | O
It O
was O
a O
disadvantage O
to O
the O
lad O
, O
for O
the O
kinder O
among O
us O
did O
not O
wish O
to O
|
                        | O
fret O
the O
master O
, O
so O
we O
humoured O
his O
partiality O
  O
and O
that O
humouring O
was O
rich O
|
                        | O
nourishment O
to O
the O
child O
's O
pride O
and O
black O
tempers O
. O
Still O
it O
became O
in O
a O
|
                        | O
manner O
necessary O
  O
twice O
, O
or O
thrice O
, O
Hindley B-PERSON
's O
manifestations O
of O
scorn O
, O
while O
|
                        | O
his O
father O
was O
near O
, O
roused O
the O
old O
man O
to O
a O
fury O
. O
He O
seized O
his O
stick O
to O
|
                        | O
strike O
him O
, O
and O
shook O
with O
rage O
that O
he O
could O
not O
do O
it O
. O
| 
  | O
At O
last O
, O
our O
curate O
, O
( O
we O
had O
a O
curate O
then O
who O
made O
the O
living O
answer O
by O
|
                        | O
teaching O
the O
little O
Lintons B-ORG
and O
Earnshaws B-ORG
, O
and O
farming O
his O
bit O
of O
land O
|
                        | O
himself O
, O
) O
he O
advised O
that O
the O
young O
man O
should O
be O
sent O
to O
college O
, O
and O
Mr O
, O
|
                        | O
Earnshaw B-PERSON
agreed O
, O
though O
with O
a O
heavy O
spirit O
, O
for O
he O
said O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
Hindley B-PERSON
was O
naught O
, O
and O
would O
never O
thrive O
as O
where O
he O
wandered O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
I O
hoped O
heartily O
we O
should O
have O
peace O
now O
. O
It O
hurt O
me O
to O
think O
|
                        | O
the O
master O
should O
be O
made O
uncomfortable O
by O
his O
own O
good O
deed O
. O
I O
fancied O
the O
|
                        | O
discontent O
of O
age O
and O
disease O
arose O
from O
his O
family O
disagreements O
, O
as O
he O
|
                        | O
would O
have O
it O
that O
it O
did O

really O
, O

know O
, O
sir O

it O
was O
in O
his O
sinking O
|
                        | O
frame O
. O
| 
  | O
We O
might O
have O
got O
on O
tolerably O
, O
notwithstanding O
  O
but O
, O
for O
two B-CARDINAL
people O
. O
Miss O

and O
Joseph B-PERSON
, O

servant O

saw O
him O
, O
I O
dare O
say O
, O
up O
yonder O
. O
He O
was O
, O
|
                        | O
and O
is O
yet O
, O
most O
likely O
, O
the O
wearisomest O
, O
self O
- O
righteous O
pharisee O
that O
ever O
|
                        | O
ransacked O
a O
bible O
to O
rake O
the O
promises O
to O
himself O
, O
and O
fling O
the O
curses O
on O
|
                        | O
his O
neighbours O
. O
By O
his O
knack O
of O
sermonizing O
and O
pious O
discoursing O
, O
he O
|
                        | O
contrived O
to O
make O
a O
great O
impression O
on O
Mr. O
Earnshaw B-PERSON
, O
and O
, O
the O
more O
feeble O
|
                        | O
the O
master O
became O
, O
the O
more O
influence O
he O
gained O
. O
| 
  | O
Hindley B-PERSON
as O
a O
|
                        | O
reprobate O
  O
and O
, O
night O
after O
night O
, O
he O
regularly O
grumbled O
out O
a O
long O
string O
|
                        | O
of O
tales O
against O
Heathcliff B-PERSON
and O
Catherine B-PERSON
  O
always O
minding O
to O
flatter O
|
                        | O
Earnshaw B-PERSON
's O
weakness O
by O
heaping O
the O
heaviest O
blame O
on O
the O
last O
. O
| 
  | O
Certainly O
, O
she O
had O
ways O
with O
her O
such O
as O
I O
never O
saw O
a O
child O
take O
up O
before O
  O
|
                        | O
and O
she O
put O
all O
of O
us O
past O
our O
patience O
fifty B-CARDINAL
times O
and O
oftener O
in O
a B-DATE
day I-DATE
: O
|
                        | O
from O
the B-TIME
hour I-TIME
she O
came O
down O
stairs O
, O
till O
the B-TIME
hour I-TIME
she O
went O
to O
bed O
, O
we O
had O
|
                        | O
not O
a O
minute B-TIME
's O
security O
that O
she O
would O
n't O
be O
in O
mischief O
. O
Her O
spirits O
were O
|
                        | O
always O
at O
high O
- O
water O
mark O
, O
her O
tongue O
always O
going O
— O
singing O
, O
laughing O
, O
and O
|
                        | O
plaguing O
everybody O
who O
would O
not O
do O
the O
same O
. O
A O
wild O
, O
wick O
slip O
she O
was O
— O
but O
, O
|
                        | O
she O
had O
the O
bonniest O
eye O
, O
and O
sweetest O
smile O
, O
and O
lightest O
foot O
in O
the O
|
                        | O
parish O
  O
and O
, O
after O
all O
, O
I O
believe O
she O
meant O
no O
harm O
  O
for O
when O
once O
she O
made O
|
                        | O
you O
cry O
in O
good O
earnest O
, O
it O
seldom O
happened O
that O
she O
would O
not O
keep O
you O
|
                        | O
company O
  O
and O
oblige O
you O
to O
be O
quiet O
that O
you O
might O
comfort O
her O
. O
| 
  | O
greatest O
punishment O
we O
|
                        | O
could O
invent O
for O
her O
was O
to O
keep O
her O
separate O
from O
him O
: O
yet O
, O
she O
got O
chided O
|
                        | O
more O
than O
any O
of O
us O
on O
his O
account O
. O
| 
  | O
In O
play O
, O
she O
liked O
, O
exceedingly O
, O
to O
act O
the O
little O
mistress O
  O
using O
her O
hands O
|
                        | O
freely O
, O
and O
commanding O
her O
companions O
: O
she O
did O
so O
to O
me O
, O
but O
I O
would O
not O

                        | O
bear O
slapping O
, O
and O
ordering O
  O
and O
so O
I O
let O
her O
know O
. O

  | O
Now O
, O
Mr. O

did O
not O
understand O

always O

grave O
with O

her O

it O

pleased O
him O
rarely O

" O

sank O
on O

I O
told O

her O

hush O

not O

having O

                        | O
finished O
his O
chapter O
, O
got O
up O
and O
said O
that O
he O
must O
rouse O
the O
master O
for O
|
                        | O
prayers O
and O
bed O
. O
He O
stepped O
forward O
, O
and O
called O
him O
by O
name O
, O
and O
touched O
his O

                        | O
shoulder O
, O
but O
he O
would O
not O
move O
— O
so O
he O
took O
the O
candle O

looked O
at O
him O
. O

  | O
I O
thought O
there O
was O
something O
wrong O
as O
he O
set O
down O
the O
light O
  O
and O
seizing O
the O

children O
each O
by O
an O

whispered O
them O
to O
" O

" O

said O
Catherine B-PERSON
, O
putting O
her O
arms O
round O
|
                        | O
his O
neck O
, O
before O
we O
could O
hinder O
her O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
poor O
thing O
discovered O
her O
loss O
directly O
— O
she O
screamed O
out O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
Oh O
, O

dead O

Heathcliff B-PERSON
! O
he O

" O
| 
  | O
And O
they O
both O
set O
up O
a O
heart O
- O
breaking O
cry O
. O

  | O
I O
joined O
my O
wail O
to O
theirs O
, O
loud O
and O
bitter O
  O
but O
Joseph B-PERSON
asked O
|
                        | O
what O
we O
could O
be O
thinking O
of O
to O
roar O
in O
that O
way O
over O
a O
saint O
in O
Heaven O
. O
| 
  | O
He O
told O
me O
to O
put O
on O
my O
cloak O
and O
run O
to O
Gimmerton B-PERSON
for O
the O
doctor O
and O
the O
|
                        | O
parson O
. O
I O
could O
not O
guess O
the O
use O
that O
either O
would O
be O
of O
, O
then O
. O
However O
, O
I O
|
                        | O
went O
, O
through O
wind O
and O
rain O
, O
and O
brought O
one O
, O
the O
doctor O
, O
back O
with O
me O
  O
the O

                        | O
other O
said O
he O
would O
come O
in O
the O
morning O
. O
| 
  | O
Leaving O
Joseph B-PERSON
to O
explain O
matters O
, O
I O
ran O
to O
the O
children O
's O
room O
  O
their O
door O
|
                        | O
was O
ajar B-PERSON
, O
I O
saw O
they O
had O
never O
laid O
down O
, O
though O
it O
was O
past B-TIME
midnight I-TIME
  O
but O
|
                        | O
they O
were O
calmer O
, O
and O
did O
not O
need O
me O
to O
console O
them O
. O
The O
little O
souls O
were O

                        | O
comforting O
each O
other O
with O
better O
thoughts O
than O
I O
could O
have O
hit O
on O
  O
no O

they O
did O
, O
in O

                        | O
their O
innocent O
talk O
  O
and O
, O
while O
I O
sobbed O
, O
and O
listened O

I O
could O
not O
help O

CHAPTER O
VI O
. O
| 
  | O
Mr. O
Hindley B-PERSON
came O
home O
to O
the O
funeral O
  O
and O
— O
a O
thing O
that O
amazed O
us O
, O
and O
set O
the O
|
                        | O
neighbours O
gossipping O
right O
and O
left O
— O
he O
brought O
a O
wife O
with O
him O
. O
| 
  | O
What O
she O
was O
, O
and O
where O
she O
was O
born O
he O
never O
informed O
us O
  O
probably O
, O
she O
had O
|
                        | O
neither O
money O
nor O
name O
to O
recommend O
her O
, O
or O
he O
would O
scarcely O
have O
kept O
the O
|
                        | O
union O
from O
his O
father O
. O
| 
  | O
object O
she O
saw O
, O
the O
moment O
she O
crossed O
the O
threshold O
, O
|
                        | O
appeared O
to O
delight O
her O
  O
and O
every O
circumstance O
that O
took O
place O
about O
her O
, O
|
                        | O
except O
the O
preparing O
for O
the O
burial O
, O
and O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
mourners O
. O
| 
  | O
I O
thought O
she O
was O
half B-CARDINAL
silly O
from O
her O
behaviour O
while O
that O
went O
on O
  O
she O
ran O
|
                        | O
into O
her O
chamber O
, O
and O
made O
me O
come O
with O
her O
, O
though O
I O
should O
have O
been O
|
                        | O
dressing O
the O
children O
  O
and O
there O
she O
sat O
shivering O
and O
clasping O
her O
hands O
, O
|
                        | O
and O
asking O
repeatedly O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
Are O
they O
gone O
yet O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
Then O
she O
began O
describing O
with O
hysterical O
emotion O
the O
effect O
it O
produced O
on O
|
                        | O
her O
to O
see O
black O
  O
and O
started O
, O
and O
trembled O
, O
and O
, O
at O
last O
, O
fell O
a O
|
                        | O
weeping O
— O
and O
when O
I O
asked O
what O
was O
the O
matter O
? O
answered O
, O
she O
did O
n't O
know O
  O
but O
|
                        | O
she O
felt O
so O
afraid O
of O
dying O
! O
| 
  | O
bright O
|
                        | O
as O
diamonds O
. O
I O
did O
remark O
, O
to O
be O
sure O
, O
that O
mounting O
the O
stairs O
made O
her O
|
                        | O
breathe O
very O
quick O
, O
that O
the O
least O
sudden O
noise O
set O
her O
all O
in O
a O
quiver O
, O
and O
|
                        | O
that O
she O
coughed O
troublesomely O
sometimes O
: O
but O
, O
I O
knew O
nothing O
of O
what O
these O
|
                        | O
symptoms O
portended O
, O
and O
had O
no O
impulse O
to O
sympathize O
with O
her O
. O
We O
do O
n't O
in O
|
                        | O
general O
take O
to O
foreigners O
here O
, O
Mr. O
Lockwood B-PERSON
, O
unless O
they O
take O
to O
us O
|
                        | O
first O
. O
| 
  | O
space O
there O
was O
to O
move O
about O
in O
, O
where O
they O
usually O
|
                        | O
sat O
, O
that O
he O
thought O
it O
unnecessary O
to O
her O
comfort O
, O
and O
so O
dropped O
the O
|
                        | O
intention O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
expressed O
pleasure O
, O
too O
, O
at O
finding O
a O
sister O
among O
her O
new O
acquaintance O
, O
|
                        | O
and O
she O
prattled O
to O
Catherine B-PERSON
, O
and O
kissed O
her O
, O
and O
ran O
about O
with O
her O
, O
and O
|
                        | O
gave O
her O
quantities O
of O
presents O
, O
at O
the O
beginning O
. O
Her O
affection O
tired O
very O
|
                        | O
soon O
, O
however O
, O
and O
when O
she O
grew O
peevish O
, O
Hindley B-PERSON
became O
tyrannical O
. O
A O
few O
|
                        | O
words O
from O
her O
, O
evincing O
a O
dislike O
to O
Heathcliff B-GPE
, O
were O
enough O
to O
rouse O
in O

him O

the O

combed O

the O

I O

came O

felt O
convinced O

long O

besides O
, O
you O

                        | O
should O
have O
known O
better O
than O
to O

  | O
" O

what O
did O
the O
master O
answer O

" O
I O
enquired O

" O
I O

                        | O

she O
began O
again O
to O
describe O
it O
rapturously O

I O
, O
as O
zealous O
as O
herself O
, O
|
                        | O
hurried O
eagerly O
home O

doted O
on O
both O

adored O

I O
could O
n't O
conceive O
how O
he O

would O
bear O
the O

, O
as O
I O

                        | O
passed O

how O
was O
the O
baby O

" O
Nearly O
ready O

" O
she O
muttered O
. O
| 
  | O
Her O
companion O
rose O
up O
, O
but O
he O
had O
n't O
time O
to O
express O
his O
feelings O
further O
, O
|
                        | O
for O
a O
horse O
's O
feet O
were O
heard O
on O
the O
flags O
, O
and O
, O
having O
knocked O
gently O
, O
|
                        | O
young O
Linton B-PERSON
entered O
, O
his O
face O
brilliant O
with O
delight O
at O
the O
unexpected O
|
                        | O
summons O
he O
had O
received O
. O
| 
  | O
Doubtless O
Catherine B-PERSON
marked O
the O
difference O
between O
her O
friends O
as O
one O
came O
in O
, O
|
                        | O
and O
the O
other O
went O
out O
. O
The O
contrast O
resembled O
what O
you O
see O
in O
exchanging O
a O
|
                        | O
bleak O
, O
hilly O
, O
coal O
country O
, O
for O
a O
beautiful O
fertile O
valley O
  O
and O
his O
voice O
, O
|
                        | O
and O
greeting O
were O
as O
opposite O
as O
his O
aspect O
— O
He O
had O
a O
sweet O
, O
low O
manner O
of O
|
                        | O
speaking O
, O
and O
pronounced O
his O
words O
as O
you O
do O
, O
that O
's O
less O
gruff O
than O
we O
talk O
|
                        | O
here O
and O
softer O
. O

  | O
" O
I O

not O

too O
soon O
, O

" O
he O
said O
, O
casting O
a O
look O
at O
me O
, O

had O
begun O
to O

  | O
" O
No O

answered O
Catherine B-PERSON

" O

I O
replied O

( O
Mr. O

) O
| 
  | O
She O
stepped O
behind O
me O
and O
whispered O
crossly O
, O
" O
Take O
yourself O

your O
dusters O

" O
It O

a O
good O
opportunity O

now O
that O

away O

" O
I O
answered O
aloud O
, O
" O
he O

                        | O

exclaimed O
the O
young O

lady O
imperiously O
, O
not O
allowing O
her O
guest O
time O

she O
had O
failed O

                        | O
recover O
her O
equanimity O
since O
the O
little O
dispute O
with O
Heathcliff B-GPE

  | O
" O
I O
'm O
sorry O
for O
it O
, O
Miss O
Catherine B-PERSON
! O
" O
was O
my O
response O
  O
and O
I O
proceeded O
|
                        | O
assiduously O
with O
my O
occupation O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
, O
supposing O
Edgar B-PERSON
could O
not O
see O
her O
, O
snatched O
the O
cloth O
from O
|
                        | O
my O
hand O
, O
and O
pinched O
me O
, O
with O
a O
prolonged O
wrench O
, O
very O
spitefully O
on O
the O
|
                        | O
arm O
. O
| 
  | O
I O
've O
said O
I O
did O
not O
love O
her O
  O
and O
rather O
relished O
mortifying O
her O
vanity O
, O
now O
|
                        | O
and O
then O
  O
besides O
, O
she O
hurt O
me O
extremely O
, O
so O
I O
started O
up O
from O
my O
knees O
, O
and O
|
                        | O
screamed O
out O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
O O

her O

the O
act O

and O
her O
ears O
red O
with O
rage O

She O
never O
had O
power O
to O
conceal O

                        | O
her O
passion O

her O
whole O
complexion O

purple O
witness O

She O
stamped O
her O
foot O

wavered O
a O
moment O

then O
, O
irresistibly O
impelled O
by O

                        | O
the O
naughty O
spirit O
within O
her O
, O
slapped O
me O
on O
the O
cheek O
a O
stinging O
blow O
that O
|
                        | O
filled O
both O
eyes O
with O
water O

interposed O
Linton B-PERSON

greatly O
shocked O

at O
the O
double O
fault O
of O

violence O
which O
his O
idol O
had O

floor O

at O
seeing O
my O

crying O
himself O

sobbed O
out O

complaints O
against O
" O
wicked O

fury O
on O

him O

the O
poor O
child O

the O
astonished O

applied O
over O

I O
was O

up O

lips O

half B-CARDINAL

she O
drew O
a O

it O
escaped O

a O

shall O
never O
know O

Having O
|
                        | O
noticed O
a O
slight O
movement O
, O
I O
turned O
my O
head O

saw O
him O
rise O
from O

bench O

out O

say O
it O
would O
degrade O

then O
he O
staid O
to O
hear O
no O

farther O
. O
| 
  | O
prevented O

the O
back O

of O
the O

I O
started O
, O

                        | O
bade O
her O
hush O

" O

nervously O
round O

get O

her O

I O
obliged O
her O
to O
obey O
  O

                        | O
and O
I O
shall O
never O

what O
a O
scene O

acted O

when O
we O
reached O
her O

                        | O
chamber O

It O
terrified O
me O
— O
I O
thought O
she O
was O
going O
mad O

I O
begged O
Joseph B-PERSON

                        | O
run O
for O
the O

| 
  | O
It O
proved O
the O
commencement O
of O
delirium O
: O
Mr. O
Kenneth B-PERSON
, O
as O
soon O
as O

                        | O
he O
saw O
her O
, O
pronounced O
her O
dangerously O
ill O
  O
she O
had O
a O
fever O
. O
| 
  | O
He O
bled O
her O
, O
and O
he O
told O
me O
to O
let O
her O
live O
on O
whey O
, O
and O
water O
gruel O
  O
and O
|
                        | O
take O

she O
did O
not O
throw O
herself O
down O

out O
of O
the O
window O
  O
and O
|
                        | O
then O
he O
left O
  O

had O
enough O
to O
do O

one B-DATE

to O

the O

From O

I O

just O

We O
made O
a O
sad O
parting O
, O

                        | O
but O
Catherine B-PERSON

tears O
were O
more O
powerful O
than O
ours O
— O
When O
I O
refused O
to O
go O
, O
and O
|
                        | O
when O
she O
found O
her O

did O

she O

husband O

me O
munificent O

  O
the O
latter O

                        | O
ordered O
me O
to O
pack O
up O
— O
he O
wanted O
no O
women O
in O
the O

, O
he O
said O
, O
now O
that O

                        | O
there O
was O
no O
mistress O
  O

as O
to O
Hareton B-GPE

so O

I O

I O

he O

it O

very O
queer O

I O
've O
no O

he O
has O

completely O

be O
sadly O

                        | O
grieved O

She O
was O
nearly O
heartbroken O

off O

guess O
his O

  | O
Mr. O
Linton B-PERSON
walked O
to O
a O
window O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
room O
that O
|
                        | O
overlooked O
the O
court O
. O
He O
unfastened O
it O
, O
and O
leant O
out O
. O
I O
suppose O
they O
were O
|
                        | O
below O
, O
for O
he O
exclaimed O
, O
quickly O
: O
— O

" O
Do O

| 
  | O
Ere O
long O
, O
I O
heard O
the O
click O
of O
the O
latch O
, O
and O
Catherine B-PERSON
flew O
up O
- O
stairs O
, O
|
                        | O
breathless O
and O
wild O
, O
too O
excited O
to O
show O
gladness O
  O
indeed O
, O
by O
her O
face O
, O
you O
|
                        | O
would O
rather O
have O
surmised O
an O
awful O
calamity O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Oh O
, O
Edgar B-PERSON
, O
Edgar B-PERSON
! O
" O
she O
panted O
, O
flinging O
her O
arms O
round O
his O
neck O
. O
" O
Oh O

And O
she O
tightened O
her O
embrace O
to O
a O

  | O
" O
Well O

cried O
her O

crossly O

she O
asked O
. O

He O
looked O
vexed O
, O
and O
suggested O
the O
kitchen O
as O
a O
more O
suitable O
place O
for O

                        | O
him O
. O
| 
  | O
Mrs. O

eyed O
him O
with O
a O
droll O
expression O
— O
half B-CARDINAL
angry O
, O
half B-CARDINAL
laughing O
at O
his O

                        | O
fastidiousness O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
No O

she O
added O
, O
after O
a O

  O

                        | O
run O
down O

secure O
my O
guest O

I O
'm O
afraid O
the O
joy O
is O
too O
great O
to O

real O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
She O
was O
about O
to O
dart O
off O
again O

" O
| 
  | O
I O
descended O
and O
found O
Heathcliff B-PERSON
waiting O
under O
the O
porch O
, O
evidently O
|
                        | O
anticipating O
an O
invitation O
to O
enter O
. O
He O
followed O
my O
guidance O
without O
waste O
|
                        | O
of O
words O
, O
and O
I O
ushered O
him O
into O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
master O
and O
mistress O
, O
|
                        | O
whose O
flushed O
cheeks O
betrayed O
signs O
of O
warm O
talking O
. O
But O
the O
lady O
's O
glowed O
|
                        | O
with O
another O
feeling O
when O
her O
friend O
appeared O
at O
the O
door O
  O
she O
sprang O
|
                        | O
forward O
, O
took O
both O
his O
hands O
, O
and O
led O
him O
to O
Linton B-PERSON
  O

then O
she O
seized O

                        | O
Linton B-PERSON
's O
reluctant O
fingers O
and O
crushed O
them O
into O
his O
. O
| 
  | O
His O
countenance O
was O
much O
older O
in O
expression O
, O
and O
decision O
of O

                        | O
feature O

Mr. O

  O
it O
looked O
intelligent O

retained O
no O
marks O
of O

former O
degradation O

A O
half B-CARDINAL

brows O
, O
and O
eyes O
full O
of O
black O
fire O
, O
but O
it O
was O
subdued O
  O
and O
his O
manner O
was O

                        | O
even O
dignified O
, O
quite O
divested O
of O
roughness O

too O
stern O
for O
grace O

My O
master O

called O
him O

Heathcliff B-PERSON
dropped O

                        | O
his O
slight O
hand O
, O

stood O
looking O
at O

" O

down O

at O
length O

old O
times O

He O
took O
a O
seat O
opposite O
Catherine B-PERSON

who O
kept O
her O
gaze O
fixed O
on O
|
                        | O
him O
as O
if O
she O
feared O
he O
would O
vanish O
were O
she O
to O
remove O
it O
. O
He O
did O
not O

his O
to O
her O

often O
  O
a O
quick O
glance O
now O

sufficed O

it O
flashed O

back O

more O

the O
undisguised O

drank O
from O

hers O

mutual O
joy O

Mr. O

grew O
pale O
with O
pure O
annoyance O

a O
feeling O
that O
reached O
its O

                        | O
climax O

his O
lady O
rose O

stepping O
across O
the O
rug O

seized O
Heathcliff B-PERSON

hands O
again O

                        | O
persuaded O

it O

all O

a O
gush O

" O

I O
started O

my O
bodily O
eye O
was O
cheated O
into O
a O
momentary O
belief O
that O
the O
child O

lifted O
its O

  O

                        | O
but O
, O
immediately O
, O
I O
felt O
an O
irresistible O
yearning O

the O
Heights B-GPE
. O
|
                        | O
Superstition B-WORK_OF_ART
urged O
me O
to O
comply O
with O
this O
impulse O
— O
supposing O
he O
should O
be O
|
                        | O
dead O
! O
I O
thought O
— O
or O
should O
die O
soon!—supposing O
it O
were O
a O
sign O
of O
death O
! O
| 
  | O
The O
nearer O
I O
got O
to O
the O
house O
the O
more O
agitated O
I O
grew O
: O
and O
on O
catching O
sight O
|
                        | O
of O
it O
, O
I O
trembled O
every O
limb O
. O
The O
apparition O
had O
outstripped O
me O
  O
it O
stood O

                        | O
looking O
through O

That O
was O
my O

" O

added O

guessing O
from O
the O

that O

He O
raised O
his O

commenced O
a O

but O
could O

                        | O
not O
stay O
his O
hand O
. O
The O
stone O
struck O
my O

then O
ensued O

                        | O
distorted O
his O

into O
a O
shocking O
expression O

You O

more O

I O
said O

met O

coming O
towards O
the O
parlour O
  O

                        | O

I O
took O
the O
liberty O
of O
turning O
back O
to O
listen O
whether O
they O
would O
resume O

                        | O
their O
quarrel O

any O

with O

entered O

was O

lay O
dashing O
her O
head O
against O

grinding O
her O

so O

that O

He O
told O
me O

some O
water O

She O
had O
no O
breath O
for O
speaking O

I O
brought O
a O
glass O
full O

turned O
up O

I O

not O

" O
Never O

I O
answered O

tartly O

I O
told O
him O
how O
she O
had O
resolved O

out O

up O
my O

mind O
for O
broken O
bones O
, O
at O

  O

she O
only O
glared O
about O
her O

for O
an O

instant O

then O
rushed O
from O

The O
master O
directed O
me O

follow O

did O
, O
to O
her O
chamber O

from O

I O
went O

whether O

" O
No O

she O
replied O

peremptorily O

  | O
The O

question O
was O
repeated O
at O
dinner O

again O
on O
the O
morrow B-DATE

the O
examination O

unsatisfactorily O

a O

that O
if O
she O
were O
so O

                        | O
insane O

CHAPTER O
XII O
. O
| 
  | O
While O
Miss O
Linton B-PERSON
moped O
about O
the O
park O
and O
garden O
, O
always O
silent O
, O
and O
almost O
|
                        | O
always O
in O
tears O
  O
and O
her O
brother O
shut O
himself O
up O
among O
books O
that O
he O
never O
|
                        | O
opened O
  O
wearying O
, O
I O
guessed O
, O
with O
a O
continual O
vague O
expectation O
that O
|
                        | O
Catherine B-PERSON
, O
repenting O
her O
conduct O
, O
would O
come O
of O
her O
own O
accord O
to O
ask O
|
                        | O
pardon O
, O
and O
seek O
a O
reconciliation O
  O
and O
|  | O
she O
| | O
to O
cast O
|
                        | O
himself O
at O
her O
feet O
  O
I O
went O
about O
my O
household O
duties O
, O
convinced O
that O
the O
|
                        | O
Grange B-PERSON
had O
but O
one B-CARDINAL
sensible O
soul O
in O
its O
walls O
, O
and O
that O
lodged O
in O
my O
|
                        | O
body O
. O
| 
  | O
I O
wasted O
no O
condolences O
on O
miss O
, O
nor O
any O
expostulations O
on O
my O
mistress O
, O
nor O
|
                        | O
did O
I O
pay O
attention O
to O
the O
sighs O
of O
my O
master O
who O
yearned O
to O
hear O
his O
lady O
's O
|
                        | O
name O
, O
since O
he O
might O
not O
hear O
her O
voice O
. O
| 
  | O
I O
determined O
they O
should O
come O
about O
as O
they O
pleased O
for O
me O
  O
and O
though O
it O
was O
|
                        | O
a O
tiresomely O
slow O
process O
, O
I O
began O
to O
rejoice O
at O
length O
in O
a B-TIME
faint I-TIME
dawn I-TIME
of O

                        | O
its O
progress O

as O
I O
thought O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
. O

  | O
Mrs. O
Linton B-PERSON
, O
on O
the B-DATE
third I-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
unbarred O
her O
door O
  O
and O
having O
finished O
the O
|
                        | O
water O
in O
her O
pitcher O
and O
decanter O
, O
desired O
a O
renewed O
supply O
, O
and O
a O
basin O
of O
|
                        | O
gruel O
, O
for O
she O
believed O
she O
was O
dying O
. O
That O
I O
set O
down O
as O
a O
speech O
meant O
for O
|
                        | O
Edgar B-PERSON
's O
ears O
, O
I O
believed O
no O
such O
thing O
, O
so O
I O
kept O
it O
to O
myself O
, O
and O
brought O
|
                        | O
her O
some O
tea O
and O
dry O
toast O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
eat O
and O
drank O
eagerly O
  O
and O
sank O
back O
on O
her O
pillow O
again O
|
                        | O
clenching O
her O
hands O
and O
groaning O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Oh O
, O
I O
will O
die O
, O
" O
she O
exclaimed O
, O
" O
since O
no O
one O
cares O
anything O
about O
me O
. O
I O
|
                        | O
wish O
I O
had O
not O
taken O
that O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Then O
a O
good O
while O
after O
I O
heard O
her O
murmur O
, O
| 
  | O
" O
No O

I O
'll O
not O

" O
| 
  | O
" O
Did O
you O
want O
anything O

ma'am O
? O
" O
I O
enquired O
, O
still O
preserving O
my O
external O

                        | O
composure O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
her O
ghastly O
countenance O
, O
and O
strange O
exaggerated O

                        | O
manner O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
What O
is O
that O
apathetic O
being O

? O
" O
she O
demanded O
, O
pushing O
the O
thick O
|
                        | O
entangled O
locks O
from O

think O

his O

long O

                        | O
confinement O

down O

dry O

to O

                        | O
ask O
you O
two B-CARDINAL
questions O
: O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
is O
, O
| 
  | O
How O
did O
you O
contrive O
to O
preserve O
the O
common O
sympathies O
of O
human O
nature O
when O
|
                        | O
you O
resided O
here O
? O
I O
can O
not O
recognise O
any O
sentiment O
which O
those O
around O
, O
share O
|
                        | O
with O
me O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
second B-ORDINAL
question O
, O
I O
have O
great O
interest O
in O
  O
it O
is O
this O
— O
| 
  | O
Is O
Mr. O
Heathcliff B-PERSON
a O
man O
? O
If O
so O
, O
is O
he O
mad O
? O
And O
if O
not O
, O
is O
he O
a O
devil O
? O
I O
|
                        | O
sha O
n't O
tell O
my O
reasons O
for O
making O
this O
inquiry O
  O
but O
, O
I O
beseech O
you O
to O
|
                        | O
explain O
, O
if O
you O
can O
, O
what O
I O
have O
married O
— O
that O
is O
, O
when O
you O
call O
to O
see O
me O
  O
|
                        | O
and O
you O
must O
call O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
very O
soon O
. O

n't O
write O
, O
but O
come O
, O
and O
bring O
me O
|
                        | O
something O
from O
Edgar B-PERSON

| 
  | O
thoughts O
, O
except O
at O
the O
moment O
when O
I O
miss O
them O
— O
I O
should O
laugh O
and O
dance O
|
                        | O
for O
joy O
, O
if O
I O
found O
their O
absence O
was O
the O
total O

my O
miseries O

the O
rest O

the O
light O
of O
a O

He O
did O
it O
with O
a O
courtesy O
that O
redounded O
to O
his O

                        | O
credit O
. O
His O
first B-ORDINAL
act O
was O
to O
elevate O
his O
torch O
to O
a O
level O
with O
my O

under O

away O

Then O
he O
took O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
horses O
, O

led O
them O
into O
the O
stables O
  O
reappearing O
for O

                        | O
the O
purpose O
of O
locking O
the O
outer O

a O
soliloquy O

shut O

  | O
Mr. O
Edgar B-PERSON
's O
coldness O
depressed O
me O
exceedingly O
  O
and O
all O
the O
way O
from O
the O
|
                        | O
Grange B-PERSON
, O
I O
puzzled O
my O
brains O
how O
to O
put O
more O
heart O
into O
what O
he O
said O
, O
when O
I O
|
                        | O
repeated O
it O
  O
and O
how O
to O
soften O
his O
refusal O
of O
even O
a O
few O
lines O
to O
console O
|
                        | O
Isabella B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
and O
I O
|
                        | O
nodded O
to O
her O
  O
but O
she O
drew O
back O
, O
as O
if O
afraid O
of O
being O
observed O
. O
| 
  | O
I O
entered O
without O
knocking O
. O
There O
never O
was O
such O
a O
dreary O
, O
dismal O
scene O
as O
|
                        | O
the O
formerly O
cheerful O
house O
presented O
! O
I O
must O
confess O
that O
, O
if O
I O
had O
been O
in O
|
                        | O
the O
young O
lady O
's O
place O
, O
I O
would O
, O
at O
least O
, O
have O
swept O
the O
hearth O
, O
and O
wiped O
|
                        | O
the O
tables O
with O
a O
duster O
. O
But O
she O
already O
partook O
of O
the O
pervading O
spirit O
of O
|
                        | O
neglect O
which O
encompassed O
her O
. O
Her O
pretty O
face O
was O
wan B-PERSON
and O
listless O
  O
her O
|
                        | O
hair O
uncurled O
  O
some O
locks O
hanging O
lankly O
down O
, O
and O
some O
carelessly O
twisted O
|
                        | O
round O
her O
head O
. O
Probably O
she O
had O
not O
touched O
her O
dress O
since O
yester O

                        | O
evening O
. O
| 
  | O
Hindley B-PERSON
was O
not O
there O
. O
Mr. O
Heathcliff B-PERSON
sat O
at O
a O
table O
, O
turning O
over O
some O
|
                        | O
papers O
in O
his O
pocket O
- O
book O
  O
but O
he O
rose O
when O
I O
appeared O
, O
asked O
me O
how O
I O
did O
, O
|
                        | O
quite O
friendly O
, O
and O
offered O
me O
a O
chair O
. O
| 
  | O
positions O
, O
that O
|
                        | O
he O
would O
certainly O
have O
struck O
a O
stranger O
as O
a O
born O
and O
bred O
gentleman O
, O
and O
|
                        | O
his O
wife O
as O
a O
thorough O
little O
slattern O
! O
| 
  | O
She O
came O
forward O
eagerly O
to O
greet O
me O
  O
and O
held O
out O
one O
hand O
to O
take O
the O
|
                        | O
expected O
letter O
. O
| 
  | O
I O
shook O
my O
head O
. O
She O
would O
n't O
understand O
the O
hint O
, O
but O
followed O
me O
to O
a O
|
                        | O
sideboard O
, O
where O
I O
went O
to O
lay O
my O
bonnet O
, O
and O
importuned O
me O
in O
a O
whisper O
to O
|
                        | O
give O
her O
directly O
what O
I O
had O
brought O
. O
| 
  | O
Heathcliff B-PERSON
guessed O
the O
meaning O
of O
her O
manœuvres O
, O
and O
said O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
If O
you O
have O
got O
anything O
for O
Isabella B-PERSON
, O

no O
doubt O
you O
have O
, O
Nelly B-PERSON
, O
give O
it O

                        | O
to O
her O
. O
You O
need O
n't O
make O
a O
secret O
of O
it O
  O
we O
have O
no O
secrets O
between O
us O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
the O
grief O
you O
have O
|
                        | O
occasioned O
  O
but O
he O
thinks O
that O
after O
this O
time O
, O
his O
household O
, O
and O
the O
|
                        | O
household O
here O
, O
should O
drop O
intercommunication O
  O
as O
nothing O
good O
could O
come O
|
                        | O
of O
keeping O
it O
up O
. O
| 
  | O
Mrs. O
Heathcliff B-PERSON
's O
lip O
quivered O
slightly O
, O
and O
she O
returned O
to O
her O
seat O
in O
the O
|
                        | O
window O
. O
Her O
husband O
took O
his O
stand O
on O
the O
hearthstone O
, O
near O
me O
, O
and O
began O
to O
|
                        | O
put O
questions O
concerning O
Catherine B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
I O
told O
him O
as O
much O
as O
I O
thought O
proper O
of O
her O
illness O
, O
and O
he O
extorted O
from O
|
                        | O
me O
, O
by O
cross O
- O
examination O
, O
most O
of O
the O
facts O
connected O
with O
its O
origin O
. O
| 
  | O
I O
blamed O
her O
, O
as O
she O
deserved O
, O
for O
bringing O
it O
all O
on O
herself O
  O
and O
ended O
by O
|
                        | O
hoping O
that O
he O
would O
follow O
Mr. O
Linton B-PERSON
's O
example O
, O
and O
avoid O
future O
|
                        | O
interference O
with O
his O
family O
, O
for O
good O
or O
evil O

Nay O
you O
'll O
move O
out O

this O

entirely O
  O

that O
you O

not O
regret O

only O
sustain O

hereafter O

by O
the O
remembrance O
of O

what O

quite O

calm O

I O
must O

                        | O
exact O

prevented O
another O

I O
thought O

it O
might O

create O
a O

illness O

then O
I O

                        | O
remembered O
Mr. O
Edgar B-PERSON
's O
stern O
rebuke O
of O
my O

I O
tried O

smooth O
away O
all O
disquietude O
on O

I O
knew O

well O

if O
I O
saw O
him O
, O
that O
Mr. O

about O
the O

place O
  O
and O
I O
shunned O
going O
out O
, O
because O
I O
still O
carried O
his O
letter O
in O
my O

went O
somewhere O

could O
not O
guess O
how O
its O
receipt O
would O
affect O
Catherine B-PERSON
. O
The O
consequence O
was O
, O

                        | O
that O
it O
did O
not O

  | O
Mrs. O
Linton B-PERSON
sat O
in O
a O
loose O
, O
white O
dress O
, O
with O
a O
light O
shawl O
over O
her O

shoulders O
, O
in O
the O
recess O
of O

, O
as O

. O
Her O
thick O
, O
long O
hair O

                        | O
had O
been O
partly O
removed O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
her O
illness O
  O
and O
now O
, O
she O
wore O

                        | O
it O
simply O
combed O
in O
its O
natural O
tresses O
over O
her O
temples O
and O
neck O
. O
Her O
|
                        | O
appearance O
was O
altered O
, O
as O
I O
had O
told O
Heathcliff B-PERSON
, O
but O
when O
she O
was O
calm O
, O
|
                        | O
there O
seemed O
unearthly O
beauty O
in O
the O
change O
. O
| 
  | O
the O
touching O
interest O
, O
which O
she O
wakened O
, O
and O
invariably O
to O
me O
, O
I O

                        | O
know O
, O
and O
to O
any O
person O
who O
saw O
her O
, O
I O
should O
think O
, O
refuted O
more O
tangible O
|
                        | O
proofs O
of O
convalescence O
and O
stamped O
her O
as O
one O
doomed O
to O
decay O
. O
| 
  | O
A O
book O
lay O
spread O
on O
the O
sill O
before O
her O
, O
and O
the O
scarcely O
perceptible O
wind O
|
                        | O
fluttered O
its O
leaves O
at O
intervals O
. O
I O
believe O
Linton B-PERSON
had O
laid O
it O
there O
, O
for O
|
                        | O
she O
never O
endeavoured O
to O
divert O
herself O
with O
reading O
, O
or O
occupation O
of O
any O
|
                        | O
kind O
  O
and O
he O
would O
spend O
many B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour I-TIME
in O
trying O
to O
entice O
her O
attention O
to O
|
                        | O
some O
subject O
which O
had O
formerly O
been O
her O
amusement O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
was O
conscious O
of O
his O
aim O
, O
and O
in O
her O
better O
moods O
, O
endured O
his O
efforts O
|
                        | O
placidly O
  O
only O
showing O
their O
uselessness O
by O
now O
and O
then O
suppressing O
a O
|
                        | O
wearied O
sigh O
, O
and O
cheeking O
him O
at O
last O
, O
with O
the O
saddest O
of O
smiles O
and O
|
                        | O
kisses O
. O
At O
other O
times O
, O
she O
would O
turn O
petulantly O
away O
, O
and O
hide O
her O
face O
in O
|
                        | O
her O
hands O
, O
or O
even O
push O
him O
off O
angrily O
  O
and O
then O
he O
took O
care O
to O
let O
her O
|
                        | O
alone O
, O
for O
he O
was O
certain O
of O
doing O
no O
good O

at O

she O

the O

                        | O
vague O
, O
distant O
look O

I O
said O

gently O
inserting O
it O
in O
one B-CARDINAL

                        | O
hand O
that O
rested O
on O

" O

break O
the O
seal O

" O

  | O
" O
Yes O

she O
answered O
, O
without O
altering O
the O
direction O
of O
her O
eyes O
. O
| 
  | O
I O
opened O
it O
— O
it O
was O
very O
short O
. O

" O

" O
I O
continued O

She O
drew O
away O

it O

I O
replaced O
it O
in O

stood O

waiting O

it O
should O
please O
her O
to O

down O

that O
movement O
was O
so O

                        | O
long O
delayed O
that O
at O

read O
it O

lifted O
the O

announce O
by O
a O
wag O
of O
the O
tail O
that O
some O
one O
approached O
whom O
it O
did O
not O

stranger O

  | O
Mrs. O

bent O
forward O

listened O
breathlessly O

The B-TIME
minute I-TIME
after O
a O
step O

                        | O
traversed O
the O
hall O
  O
the O
open O
house O

too O
tempting O
for O
Heathcliff B-PERSON
to O
resist O

                        | O
walking O
in O
: O
most O
likely O
he O
supposed O
that O
I O
was O
inclined O
to O
shirk O
my O
promise O
, O
|
                        | O
and O
so O
resolved O
to O
trust O
to O
his O
own O
audacity O
. O
| 
  | O
With O
straining O
eagerness O
Catherine B-PERSON
gazed O
towards O
the O
entrance O
of O
her O
chamber O
. O

He O
did O
not O
hit O
the O
right O

motioned O
me O
to O
admit O
him O
  O
but O
he O

                        | O
found O
it O
out O
, O
ere O
I O
could O
reach O
the O
door O
, O
and O
in O
a O
stride O

at O
her O

                        | O
side O

had O
her O
grasped O
in O
his O
arms O

                        | O
before O

I O
dare O
say O
  O
but O
then O
my O
mistress O
had O
kissed O
him O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
and O
I O
plainly O
|
                        | O
saw O
that O
he O
could O
hardly O
bear O
, O
for O
downright O
agony O
, O
to O
look O
into O
her O
face O
! O
|
                        | O
The O
same O
conviction O
had O
stricken O
him O
as O
me O
, O
from O
the O
instant O
he O
beheld O
her O
, O

                        | O
that O
there O
was O
no O
prospect O
of O
ultimate O
recovery O
there O
— O
she O
was O
fated O
, O
sure O
to O

                        | O
die O

" O

was O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
sentence O
he O

                        | O
uttered O
, O
in O
a O
tone O
that O
did O
not O
seek O
to O
disguise O
his O
despair O
. O

  | O
And O
now O
he O
stared O
at O
her O
so O
earnestly O
that O
I O
thought O
the O
very O
intensity O
of O

                        | O
his O
gaze O
would O
bring O
tears O
into O
his O
eyes O
  O
but O
they O
burned O
with O
anguish O
, O
they O

                        | O
did O
not O
melt O

howled O

both O
stained O
  O

the O
scene O

appalled O
me O
  O
still O

felt O
reluctant O
to O
quit O
him O
so O
. O
But O
the O

                        | O
moment O

recollected O
himself O
enough O

My O

I O
took O
possession O
of O
the O
lonely O
parlour O
, O

                        | O
converting O
it O
into O
a O

there O
I O

when O

opened O
, O
and O
some O
person O
entered O
out O
of O
breath O
, O
and O
laughing O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
My O
anger O
was O
greater O
than O
my O
astonishment O
for O
a B-TIME
minute I-TIME
  O
I O
supposed O
it O
one O
of O

the O
maids O
, O
and O
I O
cried O

" O
Have O
done O

How O
dare O
you O

What O
would O
Mr. O
Linton B-PERSON
say O

" O
Excuse O

myself O

With O
that O
, O
the O
speaker O
came O
forward O

the O

holding O
her O

alarmed O

be O

explanation O
as O

as O
I O
can O
give O
it O

just O
have O
the O
goodness O
to O
step O

                        | O
out O
, O
and O
order O

take O
me O
on O
to O
Gimmerton B-PERSON

and O
tell O
a O

up O
a O

in O
my O
wardrobe O
. O
" O

  | O
may O
fancy O
my O
first B-ORDINAL
fright O
was O
not O
much O

                        | O
allayed O
when O

not O

Gimmerton B-GPE

Mr. O

, O
meeting O
me O
one B-DATE
day I-DATE
in O
the O

inquired O
where O

lived O
. O
|
                        | O
I O
refused O
to O
tell O

He O
remarked O
that O
it O
was O
not O
of O
any O
moment O
, O
only O
she O
must O
|
                        | O
beware O
of O
coming O

her O

should O
not O

him O

her O

thank O

                        | O
aversion O
, O
I O
suppose O
. O
| 
  | O
He O
often O
asked O
about O
the O
infant O

when O
he O
saw O
me O
  O
and O
on O
hearing O
its O
name O
, O
|
                        | O
smiled O
grimly O
, O
and O
observed O
: O

  | O
" O

sensitive O

Grief O
, O
and O
that O
together O
, O

                        | O
transformed O
him O
into O
a O
complete O
hermit O

threw O
up O
his O
office O
of O

magistrate O
, O
ceased O

avoided O
the O

on O
all O

                        | O
occasions O
, O

spent O
a O
life O
of O
entire O

death O
: O

                        | O
ancient O

down O

                        | O
wept O

for O

Mr. O

was O
|
                        | O
extremely O
reluctant O
to O
consent O
, O
but O
I O
pleaded O
eloquently O
for O
the O
friendless O
|
                        | O
condition O
in O
which O
he O
lay O
  O
and O
I O
said O
my O
old O
master O
, O
and O
foster O
brother O
had O
|
                        | O
a O
claim O
on O
my O
services O
as O
strong O
as O
his O
own O
. O
Besides O
, O
I O
reminded O
him O
that O
|
                        | O
the O
child O
, O
Hareton B-PERSON
, O
was O
his O
wife O

nephew O
  O

, O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
nearer O

                        | O
kin O
, O
he O
ought O
to O
act O
as O
its O
guardian O
  O
and O
he O
ought O
to O
and O
must O
inquire O
how O
|
                        | O
the O
property O
was O
left O
, O

look O
over O
the O
concerns O
of O
his O
brother O

in O

law O

He O
was O
unfit O

such O
matters O

, O

he O
bid O
me O
speak O
to O
his O

                        | O
lawyer O
  O

at O
length O
, O
permitted O
me O
to O
go O

lawyer O
had O
been O
Earnshaw B-PERSON

                        | O
also O
: O
I O
called O
at O
the O
village O
, O

asked O
him O
to O
accompany O
me O
. O
He O
shook O
his O
|
                        | O
head O
, O
and O
advised O
that O
Heathcliff B-PERSON

be O
let O
alone O

affirming O
, O
if O
the O
|
                        | O
truth O
were O
known O
, O
Hareton B-PERSON
would O
be O
found O
little O
else O

a O
beggar O

  | O
whole O
property O
is O

                        | O
mortgaged O

and O
the O
sole O
chance O
for O
the O
natural O
heir O
is O
to O
allow O
him O
an O

                        | O
opportunity O
of O
creating O
some O
interest O
in O
the O
creditor O

heart O

that O
he O
may O

                        | O
be O
inclined O

deal O
leniently O
towards O
him O

When O
I O
reached O
the O
Heights B-LOC

I O
explained O
that O

come O
to O

appeared O
in O
sufficient O
distress O
, O

                        | O
expressed O
satisfaction O

bearing O

hypocrisy O

mourner O

asked O

  | O
The O
abrupt O
descent O
of O
Penistone B-PERSON

particularly O
attracted O
her O
notice O

explained O

with O
hardly O
enough O
earth O
in O

their O
clefts O

a O

" O

evening O
here O
? O
" O
she O
pursued O

" O

replied O

my O
charge O
sat O
in O
a O
corner O
of O

                        | O
the O
library O
, O
too O
sad O
for O
either O
reading O
or O
playing O
: O
in O
that O
quiet O
state O
she O
|
                        | O
caused O
me O
little O
trouble O
  O
but O
it O
was O
succeeded O
by O
an O
interval O
of O
impatient O
, O

                        | O
fretful O
weariness O
  O
and O
being O

, O
and O
too O
old O
then O
, O
to O
run O
up O
and O
down O

                        | O
amusing O
her O
, O
I O
hit O
on O
a O
method O
by O
which O
she O
might O
entertain O
herself O
. O
| 
  | O
her O
real O
and O
|
                        | O
imaginary O
adventures O
, O
when O
she O
returned O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
summer O
shone O
in O
full O
prime O
  O
and O
she O
took O
such O
a O
taste O
for O
this O
solitary O
|
                        | O
rambling O
that O
she O
often O
contrived O
to O
remain O
out O
from O
breakfast O
till O
tea O
  O
and O
|
                        | O
then O
the O
evenings O
were O
spent O
in O
recounting O
her O
fanciful O
tales O
. O
I O
did O
not O
|
                        | O
fear O
her O
breaking O
bounds O
, O
because O
the O
gates O
were O
generally O
locked O
, O
and O
I O
|
                        | O
thought O
she O
would O
scarcely O
venture O
forth O
alone O
, O
if O
they O
had O
stood O
wide O
|
                        | O
open O
. O
| 
  | O
Unluckily O
, O
my O
confidence O
proved O
misplaced O

Catherine B-PERSON

                        | O
at O
eight B-TIME

and O
said O
she O
was O
that B-DATE

going O

cross O
the O
Desert B-LOC
with O
his O

  O
and O
I O
must O
give O

trotted O
off O

a O
merry O

down O

, O
at O

, O
went O
wandering O
in O

                        | O
search O
of O

on O
the O

I O
enquired O
of O
him O

" O
I O

" O

It O
struck O
me O

                        | O
directly O
she O
must O
have O
started O
for O

| 
  | O
" O
What O
will O
become O
of O
her O

" O
I O
ejaculated O
, O
pushing O
through O
a O
gap O
which O
the O
man O

                        | O
was O
repairing O

making O
straight O

the O
high O

  | O
I O
walked O
as O

for O
a O
wager O
, O
mile O
after O
mile O
, O
till O
a O
turn O
brought O
me O
in O
view O

                        | O
of O
the O

no O

that O
is O
four B-CARDINAL

I O
began O
to O
fear O
night O

fall O
ere O

                        | O
could O

" O

what O

My O
suspense O
was O
truly O
painful O
  O

, O
at O
first B-ORDINAL

gave O
me O
delightful O

I O
picked O
up O
her O

approached O

perceiving O
that O
the O

people O
of O

behind O
the O

Hareton O

the O

laughed O

she O
joined O
them O

waxed O
more O

                        | O
impertinent O
still O
  O

I O
cried O

in O
great O
irritation O

" O

Hareton B-PERSON

" O

he O
replied O

looking O
down O

bashfully O

could O
not O

coloured O
deeper O

with O

an O
oath O

turned O

away O

Hareton O
grew O
black O
as O

at O
this O
childish O
speech O

I O
silently O

                        | O
shook O
my O
questioner O
, O

, O
at O
last O

succeeded O
in O

from O
what O

deterioration O
by O
a O

prompted O
him O

and O
pet O
him O

was O
the O

had O
been O
in O
the O

at O

the O

down O

she O
chattered O

leisurely O
over O
the O

that O
there O

sooth O
her O

                        | O
affirming O
he O
should O
come O
back O

added O
, O
however O
, O
" O

I O
can O
get O
him O
  O
" O

                        | O
and O
there O
were O
no O
hopes O
of O

would O

                        | O
return O
  O
before O
she O
did O
see O
him O
again O
, O
his O
features O
had O
waxed O
so O
dim O
in O
her O

                        | O
memory O
that O
she O
did O
not O

When O
I O

to O
encounter O
the O

visits O
to O
Gimmerton B-PERSON
, O
I O
used O
to O
ask O
how O
the O
young O
master O
got O
on O
  O
for O
|
                        | O
he O
lived O
almost O
as O
secluded O
as O
Catherine B-PERSON
herself O
, O
and O
was O
never O
to O
be O
seen O
. O
|
                        | O
I O
could O
gather O
from O
her O
that O
he O
continued O
in O
weak O
health O
, O
and O
was O
a O
tiresome O
|
                        | O
inmate O
. O
She O
said O
Mr. O
Heathcliff B-PERSON
seemed O
to O
dislike O
him O
ever O
longer O
and O
worse O
, O
|
                        | O
though O
he O
took O
some O
trouble O
to O
conceal O
it O
. O
He O
had O
an O
antipathy O
to O
the O
sound O
|
                        | O
of O
his O
voice O
, O
and O
could O
not O
do O
at O
all O
with O
his O
sitting O
in O
the O

room O
with O

                        | O
him O
many O

together O

There O
seldom O

his O

                        | O
spent O
his O

in O
a O
small O

called O
the O

lay O

  | O
I O
divined O

from O
this O
account O

that O

my O

consequently O
, O
decayed O

sense O

  | O
Mr. O

encouraged O
me O
to O
gain O
information O

thought O
a O

about O

him O
, O
I O
fancy O

and O
would O
have O
run O
some O

him O
  O

he O
told O
me O
once O

                        | O
to O
ask O
the O

She O

on O

accompanying O
his O

the O

My O

softened O
his O

I O
was O
foolish O

imagine O

His O

brighter O

there O

recollecting O

sentence O

Heathcliff B-PERSON

to O
suspected O
slights O

had O
obviously O
a O
dim O
notion O
of O
his O
inferiority O

But O

                        | O
his O

completely O
averted O

" O

The B-DATE

Her O

I O

Never O

Mr. O

up O

  | O
" O

he O
said O

His O

out O

dropping O
on O
her O

And O
what O
do O

For O

                        | O
shame O

And O
you O
must O
have O
led O
the O
way O
in O
writing O
such O
absurdities O
, O

do O
anything O

the O
sacrifice O
was O
too O

almost O
gone O

judged O

down O

She O

marvellously O
subdued O

Next B-TIME

I O
answered O

frightened O
from O

been O
considerably O
sadder O

and O
duller O
since O
its O
abandonment O

insisted O
on O

less O

his O

My O

so O

mistaking O

looked O

                        | O

neither O

movement O

I O
followed O

We O
were O
recalled O
by O
a O
scream O

Linton B-PERSON
had O
slid O
from O
his O
seat O
on O
to O
the O

                        | O
hearthstone O
, O
and O
lay O
writhing O
in O
the O
mere O
perverseness O
of O
an O
indulged O
plague O

                        | O
of O
a O
child O

to O
be O
as O
grievous O

harassing O
as O
it O
can O

  | O
I O
thoroughly O
guaged O
his O
disposition O
from O
his O

, O
and O
saw O
at O
once O
it O

would O
be O
folly O

him O

my O
companion O

ran O
back O

in O
terror O

knelt O
down O

cried O

soothed O

quiet O

twined O

rather O
unwillingly O

fancied O
  O

herself O

the O

. O
" O

  | O
" O
Give O
over O
then O
and O
talk O
, O
" O
I O
answered O
. O
| 
  | O
That O
was O
worse O
  O
she O
fretted O
and O
sighed O
, O
and O
looked O
at O
her O
watch O
till O
eight B-CARDINAL
  O
|
                        | O
and O
finally O
went O
to O
her O
room O
, O
completely O
overdone O
with O
sleep O
, O
judging O
by O
her O
|
                        | O
peevish O
, O
heavy O
look O
, O
and O
the O
constant O
rubbing O
she O
inflicted O
on O
her O
eyes O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
following O
night O
she O
seemed O
more O
impatient O
still O
  O
and O
on O
the O
third B-ORDINAL
from O
|
                        | O
recovering O
my O
company O
, O
she O
complained O
of O
a O
head O
- O
ache O
, O
and O
left O
me O
. O
| 
  | O
I O
thought O
her O
conduct O
odd O
  O
and O
having O
remained O
alone O
a O
long O
|
                        | O
while O
, O
I O
resolved O
on O
going O
, O
and O
inquiring O
whether O
she O
were O
better O
, O
and O
|
                        | O
asking O
her O
to O
come O
and O
lie O
on O
the O
sofa O
, O
instead O
of O
up O
stairs O
, O
in O
the O

                        | O
dark O
. O
| 
  | O
No O
Catherine B-PERSON
could O
I O
discover O
up O
stairs O
, O
and O
none O
below O
. O
The O
servants O
|
                        | O
affirmed O
they O
had O
not O
seen O
her O
. O
I O
listened O
at O
Mr. O
Edgar B-PERSON
's O
door O
— O
all O
was O
|
                        | O
silence O
. O
I O
returned O
to O
her O
apartment O
, O
extinguished O
my O
candle O
, O
and O
seated O
|
                        | O
myself O
in O
the O
window O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
moon O
shone O
bright O
  O
a O
sprinkling O
of O
snow O
covered O
the O
ground O
, O
and O
I O
|
                        | O
reflected O
that O
she O
might O
, O
possibly O
, O
have O
taken O
it O
into O
her O
head O
to O
walk O
|
                        | O
about O
the O
garden O
, O
for O
refreshment O
. O
I O
did O
detect O
a O
figure O
creeping O
along O
the O
|
                        | O
inner O
fence O
of O
the O
park O
  O
but O
it O
was O
not O
my O
young O
mistress O
  O
on O
its O
emerging O
|
                        | O
into O
the O
light O
, O
I O
recognised O
one O
of O
the O
grooms O
. O
| 
  | O
something O
, O
and O
reappeared O
, O
presently O
, O
leading O
Miss B-PERSON
's O
pony O
  O
and O
there O
she O
|
                        | O
was O
, O
just O
dismounted O
, O
and O
walking O
by O
its O
side O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
man O
took O
his O
charge O
stealthily O
across O
the O
grass O
towards O
the O
stable O
. O
Cathy B-PERSON
|
                        | O
entered O
by O
the O
casement O
- O
window O
of O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
, O
and O
glided O
noiselessly O
|
                        | O
up O
to O
where O
I O
awaited O
her O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
put O
the O
door O
gently O
to O
, O
slipped O
off O
her O
snowy O
shoes O
, O
untied O
her O
hat O
, O
and O
|
                        | O
was O
proceeding O
, O
unconscious O
of O
my O
espionage O
, O
to O
lay O
aside O
her O
mantle O
, O
when O
I O
|
                        | O
suddenly O
rose O
, O
and O
revealed O
myself O
. O
The O
surprise O
petrified O
her O
an O
instant O
: O
|
                        | O
she O
uttered O
an O
inarticulate O
exclamation O
, O
and O
stood O
fixed O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
My O
dear O
Miss O
Catherine B-PERSON
, O
" O
I O
began O

too O
vividly O

by O
her O
recent O

                        | O
kindness O
to O
break O
into O
a O

" O

this B-TIME

why O

to O
deceive O
me O

by O
telling O

Where O

" O
To O
the O
bottom O

stammered O

" O

the O

" O
Oh O

Catherine B-PERSON

I O
cried O

sorrowfully O

doing O

I O
'd O
rather O

three B-DATE

She O
sprang O
forward O
, O

bursting O
into O
tears O

threw O
her O
arms O
round O
my O

neck O

" O
Well O
Ellen B-PERSON

I O
'm O
so O
afraid O

you O

" O
| 
  | O
We O
sat O
down O
in O
the O
window O

seat O
  O
I O
assured O
her O
I O
would O
not O

whatever O
her O

                        | O
secret O
might O
be O
, O
and O
I O
guessed O
it O
, O
of O
course O
, O
so O
she O
commenced O
— O

  | O
and O
I O
've O
never O
missed O

                        | O
going O
a O
day O
since O
you O
fell O
ill O

thrice O
before O
, O
and O
twice O
after O
you O
|
                        | O
left O
your O
room O
. O
I O
gave O
Michael B-PERSON
books O
and O
pictures O
to O
prepare O
Minny O
every O
|
                        | O
evening O
, O
and O
to O
put O
her O
back O
in O
the O
stable O
  O
you O
must O
n't O
scold O

him O

object O
to O
my O
going O

And O
then O
|
                        | O
I O
negotiated O
with O
him O
about O
the O
pony O
. O
He O
is O
fond O
of O
reading O
, O
and O
he O
thinks O

                        | O
of O
leaving O
soon O
to O
get O
married O
, O
so O
he O
offered O
, O
if O
I O
would O
lend O
him O
books O
out O

                        | O
of O
the O
library O
, O
to O
do O
what O
I O
wished O
  O
but O
I O
preferred O
giving O
him O
my O
own O
, O
and O
|
                        | O
that O
satisfied O
him O
better O
. O

  | O
" O
On O
my O
second B-ORDINAL
visit O

Linton B-PERSON
seemed O
in O
lively O
spirits O
  O

Zillah B-PERSON
, O
that O
is O

                        | O
their O
housekeeper O

made O
us O
a O
clean O
room O

a O
good O
fire O

told O
us O
that O

out O

robbing O
our O
woods O

I O
heard O
afterwards O

we O
might O
do O

what O
we O
liked O

what O
we O
would O

do O
in O
summer B-DATE

I O
need O
n't O
repeat O

you O
would O
call O
it O
silly O

wild O
with O
joy O

wanted O
all O

ecstacy O

peace O

beat O
him O

I O
trotted O
up O

Stop O

" O
It O
may O

I O

affection O

still O

chief O
sentiment O
in O
her O

he O
spoke O
without O

tenderness O

one B-CARDINAL

Then O
Master O

forgot O
the O
first B-ORDINAL

" O
I O

answered O
my O

" O
our O
excursion O

But O
when O

reached O
him O

that O
was O
scarcely O
a O
quarter O
of O
a O
mile O
from O
his O

                        | O
own O
door O
, O
we O
found O
he O
had O
no O
horse O
, O
and O
we O
were O
forced O
to O
dismount O
, O
and O
|
                        | O
leave O
ours O
to O
graze O
. O
| 
  | O
He O
lay O
on O
the O
heath O

awaiting O
our O
approach O

did O
not O
rise O

within O
a B-QUANTITY
few I-QUANTITY

Then O
, O
he O
walked O
so O
feebly O
, O
and O
looked O
so O
pale O
, O
that O
I O

                        | O
immediately O
exclaimed O
— O

  | O
" O
Why O
, O
Master O

, O
you O
are O
not O

changed O

                        | O
the O
ejaculation O

the O
congratulation O

on O
their O
long O
postponed O
meeting O

to O
an O
anxious O
inquiry O
, O
whether O

worse O

  | O
" O
No O

better O

he O
panted O
, O
trembling O

and O
retaining O
her O
hand O
as O
if O
he O

needed O
its O
support O

possessed O

" O
But O
you O
have O
been O
worse O

his O

Linton B-PERSON
looked O

keeping O

drowsily O
on O

he O
uttered O
nothing O

                        | O
saw O
further O

only O
weary O

" O

" O
Yes O

, O
still O
under O
the O
spell O
of O

gaze O
wandered O
up O

down O

her O

gripe O

any O
addition O

We O
reached O
the O

hardly O

up O

boldness O

, O
possibly O
, O
reminded O

her O
action O
recalled O
him O

recovered O

opened O

secured O

pulling O
her O
on O

his O

Our O

to O

visitation O

that O

would O

I O
fixed O

looked O

I O
asked O

my O

I O
do O

                        | O
like O
to O

so O
! O
but O
she O
's O
a O
naughty O
thing O
for O
crying O
continually O
  O
and O
she O

                        | O
looks O
so O
pale O

wild O

'm O
afraid O

" O
Yes O

when O
I O
am O
up O

he O
turned O

shut O

again O

I O
considered O
it O
best O
to O
depart O

bring O

their O
joy O
also O
, O
was O
intense O
  O

when O
they O
heard O
that O
their O
little O

mistress O
was O
safe O

two B-CARDINAL

about O

at O
Mr. O

but O
I O
bespoke O
the O
announcement O

myself O

  | O
How O
changed O
I O
found O
him O
, O
even O
in O
those B-DATE
few I-DATE
days I-DATE
! O
He O
lay O
an O
image O
of O
sadness O
, O
|
                        | O
and O
resignation O
, O
waiting O
his O
death O
. O
Very O
young O
he O
looked O
: O
though O
his O
actual O

age O
was O

at O

                        | O
He O
thought O
of O
Catherine B-PERSON

murmured O
her O
name O

I O
touched O
his O
hand O

" O
| 
  | O
I O
trembled O
at O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
effects O
of O
this O
intelligence O
: O
he O
half B-CARDINAL
rose O
up O
, O
looked O
|
                        | O
eagerly O
round O
the O

, O
and O
then O
sunk O
back O
in O

: O
I O
said O
Heathcliff B-PERSON
forced O
me O
to O
go O
in O

which O
was O

                        | O
not O
quite O
true O

uttered O
as O
little O
as O
possible O
against O
Linton B-PERSON

did O
I O

describe O
all O
his O

did O
not O

a O

my O

on O
, O

                        | O
intending O
to O
send O
somebody O

to O
open O
it O
  O
but O
the O
knock O
was O
repeated O
, O
not O

                        | O
loud O
, O
and O
still O
importunately O
. O
| 
  | O
I O
put O
the O
jug O
on O
the O
bannister O
, O
and O
hastened O
to O
admit O
him O
, O
myself O
. O

  | O
The O
harvest O
moon O
shone O
clear O
outside O

It O
was O
not O
the O
attorney O
. O
My O
own O
sweet O

                        | O
little O
mistress O
sprung O
on O
my O
neck O
sobbing O
, O
| 
  | O
" O
Ellen B-PERSON
! O
Ellen B-PERSON
! O
Is O
papa O
alive O
? O
" O

  | O
" O
Yes O

I O
cried O

" O
yes O

God O

thanked O
, O
you O

                        | O
again O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
compelled O
her O
to O
sit O
down O
on O
a O
chair O
, O
and O
made O
her O
drink O
, O
and O
|
                        | O
washed O
her O
pale O
face O
, O
chafing O
it O
into O
a O
faint O
colour O
with O
my O
apron O
. O
Then O
I O
|
                        | O
said O
I O
must O
go O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
and O
tell O
of O
her O
arrival O
  O
imploring O
her O
to O
say O
, O
she O
|
                        | O
should O
be O
happy O
, O
with O
young O
Heathcliff B-PERSON
. O
She O
stared O
, O
but O
soon O
comprehending O
|
                        | O
why O
I O
counselled O
her O
to O
utter O
the O
falsehood O
, O
she O
assured O
me O
she O
would O
not O
|
                        | O
complain O
. O
| 
  | O
I O
could O
n't O
abide O
to O
be O
present O
at O
their O
meeting O
. O
I O
stood O
outside O

chamber O
- O
door O
, O

hardly O
ventured O
near O
the O
bed O
, O

                        | O
then O
. O
| 
  | O
All O
was O
composed O
, O
however O
  O
Catherine B-PERSON
's O
despair O
was O
as O
silent O
as O
her O
father O
's O

                        | O
joy O
. O
She O
supported O
him O
calmly O
, O
in O
appearance O
  O
and O
he O
fixed O
on O
her O
features O
|
                        | O
his O
raised O
eyes O
that O
seemed O
dilating O
with O
ecstasy O
. O
| 
  | O
He O
died O
blissfully O
, O
Mr. O
Lockwood B-PERSON
  O
he O
died O
so O
, O
kissing O
her O
cheek O
, O
he O
|
                        | O
murmured O
, O
| 
  | O
again O
, O
but O
continued O
that O
rapt O
, O
radiant O
gaze O
, O
|
                        | O
till O
his O
pulse O
imperceptibly O
stopped O
, O
and O
his O
soul O
departed O
. O
None O
could O
have O
|
                        | O
noticed O
the B-TIME
exact I-TIME
minute I-TIME
of O
his O
death O
, O
it O
was O
so O
entirely O
without O
a O

  | O
Whether O
Catherine B-PERSON
had O
spent O
her O
tears O
, O
or O
whether O
the O
grief O
were O
too O
weighty O

                        | O
to O
let O
them O
flow O
, O
she O
sat O
there O
dry O

the O
sun O
rose O
— O
she O
sat O
till O

                        | O
noon B-TIME

and O
would O

I O

                        | O
insisted O
on O
her O
coming O
away O
, O
and O
taking O
some O
repose O
. O
| 
  | O
It O
was O
well O
I O
succeeded O
in O
removing O
her O
, O
for O
at O
dinner O
- O
time O
appeared O
the O

his O
instructions O
how O

He O
had O
sold O
himself O
to O
Mr. O

that O
was O
the O

He O
gave O
all O

me O
, O
notice O
to O
quit O

He O
would O

                        | O
have O
carried O
his O

authority O
to O

quitted O

  | O
She O
told O
me O
that O
her O
anguish O
had O
at O
last O
spurred O
Linton B-PERSON
to O
incur O
the O
risk O
of O

She O
heard O

she O

CHAPTER O

  | O
The O
evening O
after O
the O
funeral O
, O
my O
young O
lady O
and O
I O
were O
seated O
in O
the O
|
                        | O
library O
  O
now O
musing O
mournfully O
, O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
us O
despairingly O
, O
on O
our O
loss O
  O
now O
|
                        | O
venturing O
conjectures O
as O
to O
the O
gloomy O
future O
. O
| 
  | O
arrangement O
to O
be O
hoped O
|
                        | O
for O
, O
and O
yet O
I O
did O
hope O
, O
and O
began O
to O
cheer O
up O
under O
the O
prospect O
of O
|
                        | O
retaining O
my O
home O
, O
and O
my O
employment O
, O
and O
, O
above O
all O
, O
my O
beloved O
young O
|
                        | O
mistress O
, O
when O
a O
servant O
— O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
discarded O
ones O
, O
not O
yet O
departed O
— O
rushed O
|
                        | O
hastily O
in O
, O
and O
said O
, O
" O
that O
devil O
Heathcliff B-PERSON
" O
was O
coming O
through O
the O
court O
, O
|
                        | O
should O
he O
fasten O
the O
door O
in O
his O
face O
? O
| 
  | O
If O
we O
had O
been O
mad O
enough O
to O
order O
that O
proceeding O
, O
we O
had O
not O
time O
. O
He O
made O
|
                        | O
no O
ceremony O
of O
knocking O
, O
or O
announcing O
his O
name O
  O
he O
was O
master O
, O
and O
availed O
|
                        | O
himself O
of O
the O
master O
's O
privilege O
to O
walk O
straight O
in O
, O
without O
saying O
a O
|
                        | O
word O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
sound O
of O
our O
informant O
's O
voice O
directed O
him O
to O
the O
library O
: O
he O
entered O
  O
|
                        | O
and O
motioning O
him O
out O
, O
shut O
the O
door O
. O
| 
  | O
but O
all O
|
                        | O
the O
apartment O
was O
visible O
, O
even O
to O
the O
portraits O
on O
the O
wall O
— O
the O
splendid O
|
                        | O
head O
of O
Mrs. O
Linton B-PERSON
, O
and O
the O
graceful O
one O
of O
her O
husband O
. O

  | O
Heathcliff B-PERSON
advanced O
to O
the O
hearth O
. O
Time B-ORG
had O
little O
altered O
his O
person O
either O
. O
|
                        | O
There O
was O
the O
same O
man O
  O
his O
dark O
face O
rather O
sallower O
, O
and O
more O
composed O
, O
|
                        | O
his O
frame O
a O
stone O
or O
two B-CARDINAL
heavier O
, O
perhaps O
, O
and O
no O
other O
difference O
. O
| 
  | O
Catherine B-PERSON
had O
risen O
with O
an O
impulse O
to O
dash O
out O
, O
when O
she O
saw O
him O
. O
| 
  | O
a O
chair O
, O
and O
never O
|
                        | O
touched O
him O
afterwards O
. O
I O
sent O
Hareton B-PERSON
out O
, O
and O
we O
had O
the O
room O
to O
|
                        | O
ourselves O
. O
In O
two B-TIME
hours I-TIME
, O
I O
called O
Joseph B-PERSON
to O
carry O
him O
up O
again O
  O
and O
, O
since O
|
                        | O
then O
, O
my O
presence O
is O
as O
potent O
on O
his O
nerves O
, O
as O
a O
ghost O
  O
and O
I O
fancy O
he O

                        | O
sees O
me O
often O

laying O

enough O

preferred O
quarrelling O

to O
pace O
the O
room O

muttering O
terrible O
things O
to O
himself O
  O
till O
I O
was O
|
                        | O
inclined O
to O
believe O
, O
as O
he O
said O
Joseph B-PERSON
did O
, O
that O
conscience O
had O
turned O
his O

                        | O
heart O
to O
an O

was O
his O
habitual O
mood O

had O
no O
doubt O

asserted O
it O
himself O
— O
but O
, O
|
                        | O
not O
a O
soul O
, O
from O
his O
general O
bearing O
would O
have O
conjectured O
the O
fact O
. O
You O

did O
not O

him O

period O
of O

I O
speak O

just O
the O

as O
then O
, O
only O
fonder O
of O
continued O
solitude O

For O
some B-DATE
days I-DATE
after O
that O
evening O
, O
Mr. O
Heathcliff B-PERSON
shunned O
meeting O
us O
at O
meals O
  O
|
                        | O
yet O
he O
would O
not O
consent O
, O
formally O
, O
to O
exclude O
Hareton B-GPE
and O
Cathy B-PERSON
. O
He O
had O
an O
|
                        | O
aversion O
to O
yielding O
so O
completely O
to O
his O
feelings O
, O
chosing O
, O
rather O
, O
to O
|
                        | O
absent O
himself O
— O
And O
eating O
once O
in O
twenty B-TIME
- I-TIME
four I-TIME
hours I-TIME
seemed O
sufficient O

                        | O
sustenance O
for O
him O
. O
| 
  | O
and O
, O
in O
the O
|
                        | O
morning O
, O
I O
found O
he O
was O
still O
away O
. O
| 
  | O
We O
were O
in O
April B-DATE
then O
, O
the O
weather O
was O
sweet O
and O
warm O
, O
the O
grass O
as O
green O
as O
|
                        | O
showers O
and O
sun O
could O
make O
it O
, O
and O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
dwarf O

trees O
, O
near O

in O
full O
bloom O

  | O
" O
After O
breakfast O
, O
Catherine B-PERSON
insisted O
on O
my O
bringing O
a O
chair O
, O
and O
sitting O
, O
|
                        | O
with O
my O
work O
, O
under O
the O
fir O
trees O
, O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
house O
  O
and O
she O
beguiled O
|
                        | O
Hareton B-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
perfectly O
recovered O
from O
his O
accident O
, O
to O
dig O
and O
arrange O
|
                        | O
her O
little O
garden O
, O
which O
was O
shifted O
to O
that O
corner O
by O
the O
influence O
of O

                        | O
Joseph B-PERSON
's O
complaints O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
was O
comfortably O
revelling O
in O
the O
spring O
fragrance O
around O
, O
and O
the O

                        | O
beautiful O
soft O
blue O
overhead O
, O
when O
my O
young O
lady O
, O
who O
had O
run O
down O
near O
the O

                        | O
gate O
, O
to O
procure O
some O
primrose O
roots O
for O
a O
border O

returned O
only B-CARDINAL
half I-CARDINAL
laden O
, O
|
                        | O
and O
informed O
us O
that O
Mr. O

was O
coming O
in O
. O

  | O
" O
' O
And O
he O
spoke O
to O
me O
, O
' O
she O
added O
with O
a O
perplexed O

                        | O
countenance O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
' O
What O
did O
he O
say O
? O
' O
asked O
Hareton B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
" O
' O
He O
told O
me O
to O
begone O
as O
fast O
as O
I O
could O
, O
' O
she O
answered O
. O
" O
But O
he O
looked O
so O
|
                        | O
different O
from O
his O
usual O
look O
that O
I O
stopped O
a O
moment O
to O
stare O
at O
him O
. O

" O
' O
How O
? O

he O
enquired O
. O

" O
' O
Why O

almost O
bright O

cheerful O

excited O

" O

I O

, O
affecting O
a O
careless O
manner O

In O
reality O

as O
surprised O

was O
  O

, O
anxious O
to O
ascertain O
the O
truth O
of O

                        | O
her O
statement O

for O
to O

" O
Heathcliff B-PERSON
stood O
at O
the O
open O

trembled O
  O
yet O
, O
|
                        | O
certainly O
, O
he O
had O
a O
strange O
joyful O
glitter O
in O
his O
eyes O
, O
that O
altered O
the O
|
                        | O
aspect O
of O
his O
whole O
face O

" O
' O
Will O
you O
have O
some O
breakfast O

I O
wanted O

contemptuously O

struck O

me O

that O
he O
plotted O
another O
midnight O

I O
set O
myself O

tended O
him O

infancy O
  O

watched O
him O
grow O
to O
youth O
  O

followed O
him O
almost O
through O
his O

                        | O
whole O
course O
  O

what O
absurd O

it O

his O
existence O
over O
again O

variations O

? O
" O
I O
|
                        | O
said O
shocked O
at O
his O
godless O
indifference O
. O
" O
How O
would O
you O
like O
it O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
They O
wo O
nt O
do O
that O
, O
" O
he O
replied O
, O
" O
if O
they O
did O
, O
you O
must O
have O
me O
removed O
|
                        | O
secretly O
  O
and O
if O
you O
neglect O
it O
, O
you O
shall O
prove O
, O
practically O
, O
that O
the O
dead O
|
                        | O
are O
not O
annihilated O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
As O
soon O
as O
he O
heard O
the O
other O
members O
of O
the O
family O
stirring O
he O
retired O
to O
|
                        | O
his O
den O
, O
and O
I O
breathed O
freer O
— O
But O
in O
the O
afternoon O
, O
while O
Joseph B-PERSON
and O
Hareton O
|
                        | O
were O
at O
their O
work O
, O
he O
came O
into O
the O
kitchen O
again O
, O
and O
with O
a O
wild O
look O
, O
|
                        | O
bid O
me O
come O
, O
and O
sit O
in O
the O
house O
— O
he O
wanted O
somebody O
with O
him O
. O
| 
  | O
I O
declined O
, O
telling O
him O
plainly O
, O
that O
his O
strange O
talk O
and O
manner O
, O
frightened O
|
                        | O
me O
, O
and O
I O
had O
neither O
the O
nerve O
, O
nor O
the O
will O
to O
be O
his O
companion O
, O
|
                        | O
alone O
. O
| 
  | O
with O
his O
dismal O
|
                        | O
laugh O
, O
" O
something O
too O
horrible O
to O
live O
under O
a O
decent O
roof O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
Then O
turning O
to O
Catherine B-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
there O
, O
and O
who O
drew O
behind O
me O
at O
his O
|
                        | O
approach O
, O
he O
added O
, O
half B-CARDINAL
sneeringly O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Will O

you O

made O

myself O
worse O
than O
the O

Well O
, O
there O
is O

one O
|  | O
who O
wo O

shrink O

                        | O
from O
my O
company O

By O
God O

she O

relentless O

Oh O
, O
damn O
it O
! O
It O
's O
unutterably O
too O
|
                        | O
much O
for O
flesh O
and O
blood O
to O
bear O
, O
even O
mine O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
He O
solicited O
the O
society O
of O
no O
one O
more O
. O
At O
dusk B-TIME
, O
he O
went O
into O
his O
|
                        | O
chamber O
— O
through O
the O
whole O
night O
, O
and O
far O
into O
the B-TIME
morning I-TIME
, O
we O
heard O
him O
|
                        | O
groaning O
, O
and O
murmuring O
to O
himself O
. O
Hareton B-PERSON
was O
anxious O
to O
enter O
, O
but O
I O
bid O
|
                        | O
him O
fetch O
Mr. O
Kenneth B-PERSON
, O
and O
he O
should O
go O
in O
, O
and O
see O
him O
. O
| 
  | O
better O
, O
and O
|
                        | O
would O
be O
left O
alone O
  O
so O
the O
doctor O
went O
away O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
following O
evening O
was O
very O
wet O
, O
indeed O
it O
poured O
down O
, O
till O
day O
- O
dawn O
  O
|
                        | O
and O
, O
as O
I O
took O
my O
morning B-TIME
walk O
round O
the O
house O
, O
I O
observed O
the O
master O
's O
|
                        | O
window O
swinging O
open O
, O
and O
the O
rain O
driving O
straight O
in O
. O

  | O
He O
can O
not O
be O
in O
bed O
, O
I O
thought O
, O
those O
showers O
would O
drench O
him O
through O
! O
He O
|
                        | O
must O
either O
be O
up O
, O
or O
out O
. O
But O
, O
I O
'll O
make O
no O
more O
ado O
, O
I O
'll O
go O
boldly O
, O
and O

                        | O
look O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
Having O
succeeded O
in O
obtaining O
entrance O
with O
another O
key O
, O
I O
ran O
to O
unclose O
the O
|
                        | O
panels O
, O
for O
the O
chamber O
was O
vacant O
— O
quickly O
pushing O
them O
aside O
, O
I O
peeped O
in O
. O
|
                        | O
Mr. O
Heathcliff B-PERSON
was O
there O
— O
laid O
on O
his O
back O
. O
His O
eyes O
met O
mine O
so O
keen O
, O
and O
|
                        | O
fierce O
, O
I O
started O
  O
and O
then O
, O
he O
seemed O
to O
smile O
. O

  | O
one O
hand O
that O
rested O
on O
the O
sill O
— O
no O

                        | O
blood O
trickled O
from O
the O
broken O
skin O
, O
and O
when O
I O
put O
my O
fingers O
to O
it O
, O
I O
|
                        | O
could O
doubt O
no O
more O
— O
he O
was O
dead O
and O
stark O
! O

  | O
I O
hasped O
the O
window O
  O
I O
combed O
his O
black O
long O
hair O
from O
his O
forehead O
  O
I O
tried O
|
                        | O
to O
close O
his O
eyes O
— O
to O
extinguish O
, O
if O
possible O
, O
that O
frightful O
, O
life O
- O
like O

They O
would O
not O
shut O

they O

                        | O
seemed O
to O
sneer O
at O
my O
attempts O

parted O
lips O
, O
and O
sharp O
, O
white O
teeth O

                        | O
sneered O
too O

Taken O
with O
another O
fit O

cried O
out O
for O
Joseph B-PERSON

                        | O
Joseph B-PERSON
shuffled O
up O

felt O

my O
memory O

recurred O

former O

sort O

poor O
Hareton O
the O
most O

                        | O
wronged O
, O
was O
the O
only O
one O
that O
really O
suffered O
much O
. O
He O
sat O
by O
the O
corpse O

                        | O
all B-TIME
night I-TIME
, O
weeping O
in O
bitter O
earnest O

He O
pressed O
its O
hand O
, O
and O
kissed O
the O

                        | O
sarcastic O

savage O
face O
that O
every O

shrank O
from O
contemplating O
  O
and O
|
                        | O
bemoaned O
him O
with O
that O
strong O
grief O

springs O
naturally O

a O
generous O

Kenneth B-PERSON
was O
perplexed O
to O
pronounce O

what O
disorder O
the O
master O
died O

I O

                        | O
concealed O
the O
fact O
of O
his O
having O
swallowed O
nothing O
for O
four B-DATE
days I-DATE
, O
fearing O
it O

                        | O
might O
lead O
to O
trouble O

then O
, O
I O
am O
persuaded O

not O
abstain O
on O

                        | O
purpose O

was O
the O
consequence O

We O
buried O
