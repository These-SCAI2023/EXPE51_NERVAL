Independent O

dedication O

unpretending O

I O

solemn O

strengthened O
from O
the O
happy O
hours O
of O
unrestrained O
intercourse O
I O
have O
enjoyed O
with O
you O

that O
, O
though O
I O
ought O
, O
perhaps O
, O
to O
have O
waited O
until O
I O

work O

merit O

pardon O

discern O

little O

PREFACE O
. O
The O
following O
story O
will O
, O
the O
author O
trusts O
, O
sufficiently O
illustrate O
its O
title O
to O
require O
but O
few O
words O
in O
the O
way O
of O
preface O
. O
She O
is O
only O
anxious O
to O
impress O
two S-CARDINAL
facts O
on O
the O
minds O
of O
her O
readers O
. O
The O
one O
— O
that O
having O
been O
brought O
before O
the O
public O
principally O
as O
the O
author O
of O
Jewish S-NORP
works O
, O
and O
as O
an O
explainer O
of O
the O
Hebrew S-NORP
Faith O
, O
some O
Christian S-NORP
mothers O
might O
fear O
that O
the O
present O
Work O
has O
the O
same O
tendency O
, O
and O
hesitate O
to O
place O
it O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
their O
children O
. O
She O
, O
therefore O
, O
begs O
to O
assure O
them O
, O
that O
as O
a O
simple O
domestic O
story O
, O
the O
characters O
in O
which O
are O
all O
Christians S-NORP
, O
believing O
in O
and O
practicing O
that O
religion O
, O
all O
doctrinal O
points O
have O
been O
most O
carefully O
avoided O
, O
the O
author O
seeking O
only O
to O
illustrate O
the O
spirit O
of O
true O
piety O
, O
and O
the O
virtues O
always O
designated O
as O
the O
Christian S-NORP
virtues O
thence O
proceeding O
. O
Her O
sole O
aim O
, O
with O
regard O
to O
Religion O
, O
has O
been O
to O
incite O
a O
train O
of O
serious O
and O
loving O
thought O
toward O
God O
and O
man O
, O
especially O
toward O
those O
with O
whom O
He O
has O
linked O
us O
in O
the O
precious O
ties O
of O
parent O
and O
child O
, O
brother O
and O
sister O
, O
master O
and O
pupil O
. O
The O
second S-ORDINAL
point O
she O
is O
desirous O
to O
bring O
forward O
is O
her O
belief O
, O
that O
in O
childhood O
and O
youth O
the O
spoken O
sentiment O
is O
one O
of O
the O
safest O
guides O
to O
individual O
character O
| | O
and O
that O
if O
, O
therefore O
, O
she O
have O
written O
more O
conversation O
than O
may O
appear O
absolutely O
necessary O
for O
the O
elucidation O
of O
" O
Home O
Influence O
, O
" O
or O
the O
interest O
of O
the O
narrative O
, O
it O
is O
from O
no O
wish O
to O
be O
diffuse O
, O
but O
merely O
to O
illustrate O
her O
own O
belief O
. O
Sentiment O
is O
the O
vehicle O
of O
THOUGHT O
, O
and O
THOUGHT O
the O
origin O
of O
ACTION O
. O
Children O
and O
youth O
have O
very O
seldom O
the O
power O
to O
evince O
character O
by O
action O
, O
and O
scarcely O
if O
ever O
understand O
the O
mystery O
of O
thought O
| | O
and O
therefore O
their O
unrestrained O
conversation O
may O
often O
greatly O
aid O
parents O
and O
teachers O
in O
acquiring O
a O
correct O
idea O
of O
their O
natural O
disposition O
, O
and O
in O
giving O
hints O
for O
the O
mode O
of O
education O
each O
may O
demand O
. O
Leaving O
the O
beaten O
track O
of O
works O
written O
for O
the O
young O
, O
the O
author's O
aim O
has O
been O
to O
assist O
in O
the O
education O
of O
the O
HEART O
, O
believing O
that O
of O
infinitely O
greater O
importance O
than O
the O
mere O
instruction O
of O
the O
MIND O
, O
for O
the O
bright O
awakening O
of O
the O
latter O
, O
depends O
far O
more O
on O
the O
happy O
influences O
of O
the O
former O
than O
is O
generally O
supposed O
. O
The O
moral O
of O
the O
following O
story O
the O
author O
acknowledges O
is O
addressed O
to O
mothers O
only O
, O
for O
on O
them O
so O
much O
of O
the O
responsibility O
of O
Home O
Influence O
devolves O
. O
On O
them O
, O
more O
than O
on O
any O
other O
, O
depends O
the O
well O
- O
doing O
and O
happiness O
, O
or O
the O
error O
and O
grief O
, O
not O
of O
childhood O
alone O
, O
but O
of O
the O
far O
more O
dangerous O
period O
of O
youth O
. O
A O
Preface O
is O
not O
the O
place O
to O
enter O
on O
their O
mission O
. O
The O
author's O
only O
wish O
is O
to O
aid O
by O
the O
thoughts O
, O
which O
in O
some O
young O
mothers O
, O
anxious O
and O
eager O
to O
perform O
their O
office O

story O
may O
excite O

To O
daughters O

hopes O
it O
may O
not O
be O
found O
entirely O
useless O
, O
for O
on O
them O

so O
much O
of O

little O
things O

so O

Opportunities O

lesser O

are O
called O

, O
a O
small O
straggling O
village O

was O
of O
such O
extremely O
rare O
occurence O
as O
to O
be O
dated O
, O
in O
the O
annals O
of O
Llangwillan S-GPE
, O
as O
a O
remarkable O
event O
, O
providing O
the O
simple O
villagers O
with O
amusing O
wonderment O
for O
weeks S-DATE
. O
The O
village O
was O
scattered O
over O
the O
side O
of O
a O
steep O
and O
rugged O
hill O
| | O
and O
on O
the O
east O
, O
emerging O
from O
a O
thick O
hedge O
of O
yews O
and O
larches O
, O
peeped O
forth O
the O
picturesque O
old O
church O
, O
whose O
tin-coated O
spire O
, O
glittering O
in O
the O
faintest O
sunshine O
, O
removed O
all O
appearance O
of O
gloom O
from O
the O
thick O
trees O
, O
and O
seemed O
to O
whisper O
, O
whatever O
darkness O
lingered O
round O
, O
light O
was O
always O
shining O
there O

The O
churchyard O
, O
which O
the O
yews O
and O
larches O
screened O
, O
was O
a O
complete O
natural O
garden O
, O
from O
the O
lowly O
cottage O
flowers O
, O
planted O
by O
loving O
hands O
over O
many O
a O
grassy O
grave O
, O
and O
so O
hallowed O
that O
not O
a O
child O
would O
pluck O
them O
, O
however O
tempted O
by O
their O
luxuriance O
and O
beauty O

A O
pretty O
cottage O
, O
whose O
white O
walls O
were O
covered O
with O
jasmine O
, O
roses O
, O
and O
honeysuckle O
, O
marked O
the O
humble O
residence O
of O
the O
village O
minister O
, O
who O
though O
in O
worldly O
rank O
only O
a O
poor O
curate O
, O
from O
his O
spiritual O
gifts O
deserved O
a O
much O
higher O
grade O

A O
gurgling O
stream O
ran O
leaping O
and O
sparkling O
over O
the O
craggy O
hill O
till O
it O
formed O
a O
deep O

wide O
bed O
for O
itself O

By O
the O
side O

this O

groups O
of O
village O
children O

continually O
found O

sometimes O
reaching O

or O
floating O
pieces O

stuck O
upright O

this O
amusement O

given O
place O
the B-DATE

to O
the O
greater O
excitement O
of O
watching O
the O
progress O
of O
a O
miniature O
frigate O
, O
the O
workmanship O
of O
a O
young O
lad O
who O
had O
only O
very O
lately O
become O
an O
inmate O
of O
the O
village O

All O
had O
been O
at O
length O
completed O

sails O

ropes O
, O
and O
masts O
, O
with O
a O
degree O

neatness O

beauty O
, O
showing O
not O
only O
ingenuity O
but O
observation O

and O
one S-CARDINAL
lovely O
summer O
evening O
the O
ceremony O
of O
launching O
took O
place O
. O
For O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes E-TIME
she O
tottered O
and O
reeled O
amid O
the O
tiny O
breakers O
, O
then O
suddenly O
regained O
her O
equilibrium O
and O
dashed O
gallantly O
along O
. O
A O
loud O
shout O
burst O
from O
the O
group O
, O
from O
all O
save O
the O
owner O
, O
a O
beautiful O
boy O
of O
some B-DATE
twelve I-DATE
years E-DATE
, O
who O
contented O
himself O
with O
raising O
his O
slight O
figure O
to O
its O
full O
height O
, O
and O
looking O
proudly O
and O
triumphantly O
round O
him O
. O
One S-CARDINAL
glance O
would O
suffice O
to O
satisfy O
that O
his O
rank O
in O
life O
was O
far O
superior O
to O
that O
of O
his O
companions O
, O
and O
that O
he O
condescended O
from O
circumstances O
, O
not O
from O
choice O
, O
to O
mingle O
with O
them O
. O
So O
absorbed O
was O
the O
general O
attention O
that O
the O
very O
unusual O
sound O
of O
carriage O
- O
wheels O
was O
unremarked O
until O
close O
beside O
them O
, O
and O
then O
so O
astounding O
was O
the O
sight O
of O
a O
private O
carriage O
and O
the O
coachman's O
very O
simple O
question O
if O
that O
road O
led O
to O
the O
village O
, O
that O
all O
hung O
back O
confused O
. O
The O
owner O
of O
the O
little O
vessel O
, O
however O
, O
answered O
proudly O
and O
briefly O
in O
the O
affirmative O
. O
" O
And O
can O
you O
direct O
me O
, O
my O
good O
boy O
, O
" O
inquired O
a O
lady O
, O
looking O
from O
the O
window O
, O
and O
smiling O
kindly O
at O
the O
abashed O
group O
" O
to O
the O
residence O
of O
Mrs. O
Fortescue S-PERSON
, O
it O

out O

the O
village O

is O
it O
not O
? O
" O
" O
Mrs. O
Fortescue S-PERSON
! O
" O
repeated O
the O
boy O
eagerly O
and O
gladly O
, O
and O
his O
cap O
was O
off O
his O
head O
in O
a O
moment O
, O
and O
the O
bright O
sunshine O
streamed O
on O
a O
face O
of O
such O
remarkable O
beauty O
, O
and O
withal O
so O
familiar O
, O
that O
though O
the O
lady O
bent O
eagerly O
forward O
to O
address O
him O
, O
emotion O
so O
choked O
her O
voice O
that O
the O
lad O
was O
enabled O
to O
reply O
to O
her O
inquiry O
, O
and O
direct O
the O
coachman O
to O
the O
only O
inn O
of O
the O
village O
, O
and O
they O
had O
driven O
off O
before O
words O
returned O
. O
The O
boy O
looked O
eagerly O
after O
them O
, O
then O
desiring O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
his O
companions O
to O
meet O
the O
lady O
at O
the O
inn O
, O
and O
guide O
her O
to O
the O
cottage O
, O
caught O
up O
his O
little O
vessel O
, O
and O
darted O
off O
across O
some O
fields O
which O
led O
by O
a O
shorter O
cut O
to O
the O
same O
place O
. O
It O
was O
a O
very O
humble O
dwelling O
, O
so O
surrounded O
by O
hills O
that O
their O
shadow O
always O
seemed O
to O
overhang O
it O
: O
yet O
within O
, O
the O
happy O
temper O
of O
a O
poor O
widow O
and O
her O
daughter O
kept O
up O
a O
perpetual O
sunshine O
. O
Three B-DATE
weeks E-DATE
previous O
to O
the O
evening O
we O
have O
mentioned O
, O
a O
lady O
and O
two S-CARDINAL
children O
had O
arrived O
at O
Llangwillan S-GPE
, O
unable O
to O
proceed O
farther O
from O
the O
severe O
indisposition O
of O
the O
former O
. O
They O
were O
unattended O
, O
and O
the O
driver O
only O
knew O
that O
their O
destination O
was O
Swansea S-GPE
| | O
he O
believed O
they O
had O
been O
shipwrecked O
off O
Pembroke S-GPE
, O
and O
that O
the O
poor O
lady O
was O
very O
ill O
when O
she O
commenced O
her O
journey O
, O
but O
the O
curious O
inquiries O
of O
the O
villagers O
could O
elicit O
nothing O
more O
. O
Mr. O
Myrvin S-PERSON
, O
with O
characteristic O
benevolence O
, O
devoted O
himself O
to O
insuring O
, O
as O
far O
as O
he O
could O
, O
the O
comfort O
of O
the O
invalid O
| | O
had O
her O
removed O
from O
the O
inn O
to O
Widow B-FAC
Morgan's E-FAC
cottage O
, O
confident O
that O
there O
she O
would O
at O
least O
be O
nursed O
with O
tenderness O
and O
care O
, O
and O
so O
near O
him O
as O
to O
permit O
his O
constant O
watchfulness O
. O
But O
a B-DATE
very I-DATE
few I-DATE
days E-DATE
too O
sadly O
convinced O
him O
, O
not O
only O
that O
her O
disease O
was O
mortal O
, O
but O
that O
his O
presence O
and O
gentle O
accents O
irritated O
instead O
of O
soothed O
. O
Ill O
- O
temper O
and O
self O
- O
will O
seemed O
to O
increase O
with O
the O
weakness O
, O
which O
every O
day O
rendered O
her O
longing O
to O
continue O
her O
journey O
more O
and O
more O
futile O
. O
It O
was O
some O
days O
before O
she O
could O
even O
be O
persuaded O
to O
write O
to O
the O
relative O
she O
was O
about O
to O
seek O
, O
so O
determined O
was O
she O
that O
she O
would O
get O
well O
| | O
and O
when O
the O
letter O
was O
forwarded O
, O
and O
long O
before O
an O
answer O
could O
have O
been O
received O
( O
for O
twenty B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago E-DATE
there O
were O
no O
railroads O
to O
carry O
on O
epistolary O
communication O
as O
now O
) O
, O
fretfulness O
and O
despondency O
increased O
physical O
suffering O
, O
by O
the O
determined O
conviction O
that O
she O
was O
abandoned O
, O
her O
children O
would O
be O
left O
uncared O
for O
. O
In O
vain O
Mr. O
Myrvin S-PERSON
assured O
her O
of O
the O
impossibility O
yet O
to O
receive O
a O
reply O
, O
that O
the O
direction O
might O
not O
even O
have O
been O
distinct O
enough O
, O
for O
her O
memory O
had O
failed O
her O
in O
dictating O
it O
| | O
she O
knew O
she O
was O
deserted O
, O
she O
might O
have O
deserved O
it O
, O
but O
her O
Edward S-PERSON
was O
innocent O
, O
and O
it O
was O
very O
hard O
on O
him O
. O
As O
self O
- O
will O
subsided O
in O
physical O
exhaustion O
, O
misery O
increased O
. O
A O
restless O
torturing O
remembrance O
seemed O
to O
have O
taken O
possession O
of O
her O
, O
which O
all O
the O
efforts O
of O
the O
earnest O
clergyman O
were O
utterly O
ineffectual O
to O
remove O
. O
She O
would O
not O
listen O
to O
the O
peace O
he O
proffered O
, O
and O
so O
painfully O
did O
his O
gentle O
eloquence O
appear O
to O
irritate O
instead O
of O
calm O
, O
that O
he O
desisted O
, O
earnestly O
praying O
, O
that O
her O
sister O
might O
answer O
the O
letter O
in O
person O
, O
and O
by O
removing O
anxiety O
prepare O
the O
mind O
for O
better O
thoughts O
. O
One S-CARDINAL
object O
alone O
had O
power O
to O
bring O
something O
like O
a O
smile O
to O
that O
altered O
but O
still O
most O
beautiful O
countenance O
, O
conquer O
even O
irritation O
, O
and O
still O
create O
intervals O
of O
pleasure O
— O
it O
was O
her O
son O
, O
the O
same O
beautiful O
boy O
we O
have O
already O
noticed O
, O
and O
whose O
likeness O
to O
herself O
was O
so O
extraordinary O
that O
it O
would O
have O
been O
almost O
too O
feminine O
a O
beauty O
, O
had O
it O
not O
been O
for O
the O
sparkling O
animated O
expression O
of O
every O
feature O
, O
and O
the O
manly O
self O
- O
possession O
which O
characterized O
his O
every O
movement O
. O
That O
he O
should O
be O
his O
mother's O
idol O
was O
not O
very O
surprising O
, O
for O
the O
indiscreet O
and O
lavish O
indulgence O
which O
had O
been O
his O
from O
birth O
, O
had O
not O
yet O
had O
power O
to O
shake O
his O
doating O
fondness O
for O
his O
mother O
, O
or O
interfere O
with O
her O
happiness O
by O
the O
visible O
display O
of O
the O
faults O
which O
her O
weakness O
had O
engendered O
. O
Caressingly O
affectionate O
, O
open O
- O
hearted O
, O
generous O
, O
and O
ever O
making O
her O
his O
first S-ORDINAL
object O
, O
perhaps O
even O
a O
more O
penetrating O
mother O
would O
have O
seen O
nothing O
to O
dread O
but O
all O
to O
love O
. O
His O
uncontrolled O
passion O
at O
the O
slightest O
cross O
, O
his O
haughty O
pride O
and O
indomitable O
will O
toward O
all O
save O
her O
, O
but O
increased O
her O
affection O
. O
And O
when O
he O
was O
with O
her O
, O
which O
he O
was O
very O
often O
, O
considering O
that O
a O
sick O
close O
room O
would O
have O
been O
utterly O
repugnant O
to O
him O
had O
it O
not O
contained O
his O
mother O
, O
Mrs. O
Fortescue S-PERSON
was O
actually O
happy O
. O
But O
it O
was O
a O
happiness O
only O
increasing O
her O
intensity O
of O
suffering O
when O
her O
son O
was O
absent O
. O
Hide O
it O
from O
herself O
as O
she O
might O
, O
the O
truth O
would O
press O
upon O
her O
that O
she O
was O
dying O
, O
and O
her O
darling O
must O
be O
left O
to O
the O
care O
of O
relations O
indeed O
, O
but O
utter O
strangers O
to O
him O
, O
and O
unlikely O
to O
treat O
him O
as O
she O
had O
done O
. O
She O
knew O
that O
he O
had O
, O
what O
strict O
disciplinarians O
, O
as O
she O
chose O
to O
regard O
her O
sister O
and O
her O
husband O
, O
would O
term O
and O
treat O
as O
serious O
faults O
, O
while O
she O
felt O
them O
actually O
virtues O
| | O
and O
agony O
for O
him O
in O
the O
dread O
of O
what O
he O
might O
be O
called O
upon O
to O
endure O
, O
would O
deluge O
her O
pillow O
with O
passionate O
tears O
, O
and O
shake O
her O
slight O
frame O
as O
with O
convulsion O
. O
The O
day O
we O
have O
mentioned O
, O
Edward S-PERSON
had O
been O
absent O
longer O
than O
usual O
, O
and O
toward O
evening O
Mrs. O
Fortescue S-PERSON
awoke O
from O
a O
troubled O
sleep O
to O
brood O
over O
these O
thoughts O
, O
till O
they O
had O
produced O
their O
usual O
effect O
in O
tears O
and O
sobs O
, O
the O
more O
painful O
to O
witness O
from O
the O
increasing O
physical O
incapacity O
to O
struggle O
with O
them O
. O
A O
little O
girl O
, O
between B-DATE
ten I-DATE
and I-DATE
eleven I-DATE
years I-DATE
old E-DATE
, O
was O
seated O
on O
a O
low O
wooden O
stool O
, O
half S-CARDINAL
concealed O
by O
the O
coarse O
curtain O
of O
the O
bed O
, O
employed O
in O
sewing O
some O
bright O
gilt O
buttons O
on O
a O
blue O
jacket O
. O
It O
seemed O
hard O
work O
for O
those O
small O
, O
delicate O
hands O
| | O
but O
she O
did O
not O
look O
up O
from O
her O
task O
till O
roused O
by O
the O
too O
familiar O
sound O
of O
her O
mother's O
suffering O
, O
and O
then O
, O
as O
she O
raised O
her O
head O
, O
and O
flung O
back O
the O
heavy O
and O
somewhat O
disordered O
ringlets O
, O
the O
impulse O
seemed O
to O
be O
to O
spring O
up O
and O
try O
to O
soothe O
, O
but O
a O
mournful O
expression O
quickly O
succeeded O
, O
and O
she O
sat O
several B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
without O
moving O
. O
At O
length O
, O
as O
Mrs. O
Fortescue's S-PERSON
sobs O
seemed O
almost O
to O
suffocate O
her O
, O
the O
child O
gently O
bent O
over O
her O
, O
saying O
, O
very O
timidly O
, O
" O
Dear O
mamma O
, O
shall O
I O
call O
widow O
Morgan S-PERSON
, O
or O
can O
I O
get O
any O
thing O
for O
you O
? O
" O
and O
, O
without O
waiting O
for O
a O
reply O
, O
save O
the O
angry O
negative O
to O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
question O
, O
she O
held O
a O
glass O
of O
water O
to O
her O
mother's O
lips O
and O
bathed O
her O
forehead O
. O
After O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes E-TIME
Mrs. O
Fortescue S-PERSON
revived O
sufficiently O
to O
inquire O
where O
Edward S-PERSON
was O
. O
" O
He O
has O
gone O
down O
to O
the O
stream O
to O
launch O
his O
little O
frigate O
, O
mamma O
, O
and O
asked O
me O
to O
fasten O
these O
buttons O
on O
his O
jacket O
, O
to O
make O
it O
look O
like O
a O
sailor's O
meanwhile O
| | O
I O
do O
not O
think O
he O
will O
be O
very O
long O
now O
. O
" O
Mrs. O
Fortescue S-PERSON
made O
no O
rejoinder O
, O
except O
to O
utter O
aloud O
those O
thoughts O
which O
had O
caused O
her O
previous O
paroxysm O
, O
and O
her O
little O
girl O
, O
after O
a O
very O
evident O
struggle O
with O
her O
own O
painful O
timidity O
, O
ventured O
to O
say O
: O
" O
But O
why O
should O
you O
fear O
so O
much O
for O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
dear O
mamma O
? O
Every O
body O
loves O
him O
and O
admires O
him O
, O
so O
I O
am O
sure O
my O
aunt O

uncle O
will O
. O
" O
" O
Your O
aunt O
may O
for O
my O
sake O
, O
but O
she O
will O
not O
love O
or O
bear O
with O
his O
childish O
faults O
as O
I O
have O
done O

and O
your O
uncle O
is O
such O
a O
harsh O
, O
stern O
man O
, O
that O
there O
is O
little O
hope O
for O
his O
forbearance O
with O
my O
poor O
Edward S-PERSON
. O
And O
he O
is O
so O
frank O
and O
bold O
, O
he O
will O
not O
know O
how O
even O
to O
conceal O
his O
boyish O
errors O
, O
and O
he O
will O
be O
punished O
, O

his O
fine O
spirit O
broken O

who O
will O
be O
there O
to O
shield O

soothe O
him O

" O
" O
I O
may O
be O
able O
sometimes O

mamma O

indeed O
, O
indeed O
, O
I O
will O
whenever O
I O
can O

" O
replied O
her O
child O
, O
with O
affecting O
earnestness O
. O
" O
I O
love O
him O
so O
very O

very O
much O

harshness O

your O
power O

" O
exclaimed O
Mrs. O
Fortescue S-PERSON
, O
so O
eagerly O
, O
that O
she O
half O
raised O
herself O
, O
and O
pressed O
Ellen S-PERSON
to O
her O
with O
an O
appearance O
of O
affection O
so O
unusual O
, O
and O
a O
kiss O
so O
warm O
, O
that O
that O
moment O
never O
passed O
from O
the O
child's O
mind O
, O
and O
the O
promise O
she O
gave O
was O
registered O
in O
her O
own O
heart O
, O
with O
a O
solemnity O
and O
firmness O
of O
purpose O
little O
imagined O
by O
her O
mother O
, O
who O
when O
she O
demanded O
it O
, O
conceived O
neither O
its O
actual O
purport O
nor O
extent O
| | O
she O
only O
felt O
relieved O
that O
Edward S-PERSON
would O
have O
some O
one O
by O
him O
, O
to O
love O
him O
and O
enable O
him O
to O
conceal O
his O
errors O
, O
if O
he O
should O
commit O
any O
. O
Had O
she O
studied O
and O
known O
the O
character O
of O
Ellen S-PERSON
as O
she O
did O
that O
of O
her O
son O
, O
that O
promise O
would O
perhaps O
never O
have O
been O
asked O
| | O
nor O
would O
she O
so O
incautiously O
and O
mistakenly O
have O
laid O
so O
great O
a O
stress O
upon O
concealment O
, O
as O
the O
only O
sure O
means O
of O
guarding O
from O
blame O
. O
From O
her O
childhood O
Mrs. O
Fortescue S-PERSON
had O
been O
a O
creature O
of O
passion O
and O
impulse O
, O
and O
maternity O
had O
unhappily O
not O
altered O
one S-CARDINAL
tittle O
of O
her O
character O
. O
In O
what O
manner O
, O
or O
at O
what O
cost O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
might O
be O
enabled O
to O
keep O
that O
promise O
, O
never O
entered O
her O
mind O
. O
It O
had O
never O
been O
her O
wont O
, O
even O
in O
days S-DATE
of O
health O
, O
to O
examine O
or O
reflect O
, O
and O
present O
weakness O
permitted O
only O
the O
morbid O
indulgence O
of O
one S-CARDINAL
exaggerated O
thought O
. O
For O
several B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
she O
lay O
quite O
silent O
, O
and O
Ellen S-PERSON
resumed O
her O
seat O
and O
work O
, O
her O
temples O
throbbing O
, O
she O
knew O
not O
why O
, O
and O
a O
vain O
longing O
to O
throw O
her O
arms O
round O
her O
mother's O
neck O
, O
and O
entreat O
her O
only O
for O
one O
more O
kiss O
, O
one S-CARDINAL
other O
word O
of O
love O
| | O
and O
the O
consciousness O
that O
she O
dared O
not O
, O
caused O
the O
hot O
tears O
to O
rush O
into O
her O
eyes O
, O
and O
almost O
blind O
her O
, O
but O
she O
would O
not O
let O
them O
fall O
, O
for O
she O
had O
learned O
long O
ago O
, O
that O
while O
Edward's S-PERSON
tears O
only O
excited O
soothing O
and O
caresses O
, O
hers O
always O
called O
forth O
irritation O
and O
reproof O
. O
" O
Joy O
, O
joy O
! O
Mother O
, O
darling O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
an O
eager O
voice O
, O
some O
minutes O
afterward O
, O
and O
Edward S-PERSON
bounded O
into O
the O
room O
, O
and O
throwing O
himself O
by O
his O
mother's O
side O
, O
kissed O
her O
pale O
cheek O
again O
and O
again O
. O
" O
Such O
joy O
! O
My O
ship O
sailed O
so O
beautifully O
, O
I O
quite O
longed O
for O
you O
to O
see O
it O
, O
and O
you O
will O
one O
day O
when O
you O
get O
well O
and O
strong O
again O

and O
I O
know O
you O
will O
soon O
now O
, O
for O
I O
am O
sure O
aunt O
Emmeline S-PERSON
will O
very O
soon O
come O
, O
and O
then O
, O
then O
, O
you O
will O
be O
so O
happy O

and O
we O
shall O
all O
be O
happy O
again O
! O
" O
Mrs. O
Fortescue S-PERSON
pressed O
him O
closer O
and O
closer O
to O
her O
, O
returning O
his O
kisses O
with O
such O
passionate O
fondness O
, O
that O
tears O
mingled O
with O
them O
, O
and O
fell O
upon O
his O
cheek O
. O
" O
Don't O
cry O
, O
mamma O
, O
dear O
! O
indeed O
, O
indeed O
, O
my O
aunt O
will O
soon O
come O

Do O
you O
know O
I O
think O
I O
have O
seen O
her O

spoken O
to O
her O

too O

" O
" O

her O
, O
Edward S-PERSON
? O
You O
mean O
you O
have O
dreamed O
about O
her O
, O
and O
so O
fancy O
you O
have O
seen O
her O

" O
but O
the O
eager O
, O
anxious O
look O
she O
fixed O
upon O
him O
evinced O
more O
hope O
than O
her O
words O
. O
" O
No O
, O
no O
, O
mamma O

as O
we O
were O
watching O
my O
ship O
, O
a O
carriage O
passed O
us O
, O
and O
a O
lady O
spoke O
to O
me O
, O
and O
asked O
me O
the O
way O
to O
the O
cottage O
where O
you O
lived O
, O
and O
I O
am O
sure O
it O
is O
aunt O

her O
smile O

" O
" O
It O
can O
not O

murmured O
his O
mother O
, O
sadly O

" O
unless O
— O
" O
and O
her O
countenance O
brightened O
. O
" O
Did O
she O
speak O
to O
you O
, O
Edward S-PERSON

as O
if O
she O
knew O
you O

recognized O
you O

from O
your O
likeness O

me O

" O
" O
No O
, O
mamma O
, O
there O
was O
no O
time O
, O
the O
carriage O
drove O
off O
again O
so O
quickly O

but O
, O
hush O
! O
I O
am O
sure O
I O
hear O
her O
voice O
down O
stairs O
, O
" O
and O
he O
sprung O
up O
from O
the O
bed O
and O
listened O
eagerly O
. O
" O
Yes O
, O
yes O
, O
I O
am O
right O

and O
she O
is O
coming O
up O

no O

it's O
only O
widow O
Morgan S-PERSON

I O
am O
sure O
it O
is O
my O
aunt O
by O
your O
face O
, O
" O
he O
added O
, O
impatiently O
, O
as O
Mrs. O
Morgan S-PERSON
tried O
by O
signs O
to O
beg O
him O
to O
be O
more O
cautious O
, O
and O
not O
to O
agitate O
his O
mother O
. O
" O
Why O
don't O
you O
let O
her O
come O
up O
? O
" O
and O
springing O
down O
the O
whole O
flight O
of O
stairs O
in O
two S-CARDINAL
bounds O
, O
he O
rushed O
into O
the O
little O
parlor O
, O
caught O
hold O
of O
the O
lady's O
dress O
, O
and O
exclaimed O
, O
" O
You O
are O
my O
aunt O
, O
my O
own O
dear O
aunt O

do O
come O
up O
to O
mamma O
, O
she O
has O
been O
wanting O
you O
so O
long O
, O
so O
very O
long O
, O
and O
you O
will O
make O
her O
well O

dear O
aunt O

will O
you O
not O
? O
" O
" O
Oh O
, O
that O
I O
may O
be O
allowed O
to O
do O
so O
, O
dear O
boy O
! O
" O
was O
the O
painfully O
agitated O
reply O
, O
and O
she O
hastened O
up O
the O
stairs O
. O
But O
to O
Edward's S-PERSON
grief O
and O
astonishment O
, O
so O
little O
was O
he O
conscious O
of O
his O
mother's O
exhausted O
state O
, O
the O
sight O
of O
his O
aunt O
, O
prepared O
in O
some O
measure O
as O
she O
was O
, O
seemed O
to O
bring O
increase O
of O
suffering O
instead O
of O
joy O
. O
There O
was O
a O
convulsive O
effort O
for O
speech O
, O
a O
passionate O
return O
of O
her O
sister's O
embrace O
, O
and O
she O
fainted O
. O
Edward S-PERSON
in O
terror O
flung O
himself O
beside O
her O
, O
entreating O
her O
not O
to O
look O
so O
pale O
, O
but O
to O
wake O
and O
speak O
to O
him O
. O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
quickness O
and O
decision O
, O
which O
even O
at O
that O
moment O
caused O
her O
aunt O
to O
look O
at O
her O
with O
astonishment O
, O
applied O
the O
usual O
restoratives O
, O
evincing O
no O
unusual O
alarm O
, O
and O
a O
careless O
observer O
might O
have O
said O
, O
no O
feeling O
| | O
but O
it O
was O
only O
a O
momentary O
thought O
which O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
could O
give O
to O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
every O
feeling O
was O
engrossed O
in O
the O
deep O
emotion O
with O
which O
she O
gazed O
on O
the O
faded O
form O
and O
altered O
face O
of O
that O
still O
beloved O
though O
erring O
one O
: O
who O
, O
when O
she O
had O
last O
beheld O
her O
, O
thirteen B-DATE
years E-DATE
previous O
, O
was O
bright O
, O
buoyant O
, O
lovely O
as O
the O
boy O
beside O
them O
. O
Her O
voice O
yet O
, O
more O
than O
the O
proffered O
remedies O
, O
seemed O
to O
recall O
life O
, O
and O
after O
a O
brief O
interval O
the O
choking O
thought O
found O
words O
. O
" O
My O
father O
! O
my O
father O
! O
Oh O
, O
Emmeline S-PERSON
I O
know O
that O
he O
is O
dead O
! O
My O
disobedience O
, O
my O
ingratitude O
for O
all O
his O
too O
indulgent O
love O
, O
killed O
him O
— O
I O
know O
it O
did O
. O
But O
did O
he O
curse O
me O
, O
Emmeline S-PERSON
? O
did O
all O
his O
love O
turn O
to O
wrath O
, O
as O
it O
ought O
to O
have O
done O
? O
did O
— O
" O
" O
Dearest O
Eleanor S-PERSON
, O
" O
replied O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
with O
earnest O
tenderness O
, O
" O
dismiss O
such O
painful O
thoughts O
at O
once O
| | O
our O
poor O
father O
did O
feel O
your O
conduct O
deeply O
, O
but O
he O
forgave O
it O
, O
would O
have O
received O
your O
husband O
, O
caressed O
, O
loved O
you O
as O
before O
, O
had O
you O
but O
returned O
to O
him O
| | O
and O
so O
loved O
you O
to O
the O
last O
moment O
, O
that O
your O
name O
was O
the O
last O
word O
upon O
his O
lips O
. O
But O
this O
is O
no O
subject O
for O
such O
youthful O
auditors O
, O
" O
she O
continued O
, O
interrupting O
herself O
, O
as O
she O
met O
Edward's S-PERSON
bright O
eyes O
fixed O
wonderingly O
upon O
her O
face O
, O
and O
noticed O
the O
excessive O
paleness O
of O
Ellen's S-PERSON
cheek O
. O
" O
You O
look O
weary O
, O
my O
love O
, O
" O
she O
said O
, O
kindly O
, O
drawing O
her O
niece O
to O
her O
, O
and O
affectionately O
kissing O
her O
. O
" O
Edward S-PERSON
has O
made O
his O
own O
acquaintance O
with O
me O
, O
why O
did O
you O
not O
do O
so O
too O
? O
But O
go O
now O
into O
the O
garden O
for O
a O
little O
while O
, O
I O
am O
sure O
you O
want O
fresh O
air O
, O
and O
I O
will O
take O
your O
place O
as O
nurse O
mean O
while O
. O
Will O
you O
trust O
me O
? O
" O
And O
the O
kind O
smile O
which O
accompanied O
her O
words O
gave O
Ellen S-PERSON
courage O
to O
return O
her O
kiss O
, O
but O
she O
left O
the O
room O
without O
speaking O
. O
Edward S-PERSON
required O
more O
persuasion O

and O
the O
moment O
he O
was O
permitted O
he O
returned O
, O
seated O
himself O
on O
a O
stool O
at O
his O
aunt's O
feet O
, O
laid O
his O
head O
on O
her O
lap O
, O
and O
remained O
for O
nearly B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour E-TIME
quite O
silent O
, O
watching O
with O
her O
the O
calm O
slumbers O
which O
had O
followed O
the O
agitating O
conversation O
between O
them O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
was O
irresistibly O
attracted O
toward O
him O
, O
and O
rather O
wondered O
that O
Ellen S-PERSON
should O
stay O
away O
so O
long O
. O
She O
did O
not O
know O
that O
Edward S-PERSON
had O
spent O
almost O
the O
whole O
of O
that O
day O
in O
the O
joyous O
sports O
natural O
to O
his O
age O
, O
and O
that O
it O
had O
been O
many O
weary O
days O
and O
nights O
since O
Ellen S-PERSON
had O
quitted O
her O
mother's O
room O

GLIMPSES O
INTO O
A O
CHILD'S O
HEART O
. O
— O
A O
DEATHBED O
. O
On O
leaving O
the O
cottage O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
hastily O
traversed O
the O
little O
garden O
, O
and O
entered O
a O
narrow O
lane O
, O
leading O
to O
Mr. O
Myrvin's S-PERSON
dwelling O
. O
Her O
little O
heart O
was O
swelling O
high O
within O
her O
, O
and O
the O
confinement O
she O
had O
endured O
, O
the O
constant O
control O
she O
exercised O
for O
fear O
she O
should O
add O
to O
her O
mother's O
irritation O
, O
combined O
with O
the O
extreme O
delicacy O
of O
natural O
constitution O
, O
had O
so O
weakened O
her O
, O
as O
to O
render O
the O
slightest O
exertion O
painful O
. O
She O
had O
been O
so O
often O
reproved O
as O
fretful O
and O
ill O
- O
tempered O
, O
whenever O
in O
tears O
, O
that O
she O
always O
checked O
and O
concealed O
them O
. O
She O
had O
been O
so O
frequently O
told O
that O
she O
did O
not O
know O
what O
affection O
was O
, O
that O
she O
was O
so O
inanimate O
and O
cold O
, O
that O
though O
she O
did O

she O
believed O
she O
was O
different O
to O
any O
one O
else O
, O
and O
was O
unhappy O
without O
knowing O
why O
. O
Compared O
with O
her O
brother O
, O
she O
certainly O
was O
neither O
a O
pretty O
nor O
an O
engaging O
child O
. O
Weakly O
from O
her O
birth O
, O
her O
residence O
in O
India S-GPE
had O
increased O
constitutional O
delicacy O

while O
to O
a O

eye O
the O
expression O
of O
her O
countenance O
denoted O
constant O

, O
the O
heedless O
and O
superficial O
observer O
would O
condemn O
it O
as O
peevishness O
, O
and O
so O
unnatural O
to O
a O
young O
child O
, O
that O
nothing O
but O
confirmed O
ill O
- O
temper O
could O
have O
produced O
it O
. O
The O
soft O
, O
beautifully O
- O
formed O
black O
eye O
was O
too O
large O
for O
her O
other O
features O
, O
and O
the O
sallowness O
of O
her O
complexion O
, O
the O
heavy O
tresses O
of O
very O
dark O
hair O
, O
caused O
her O
to O
be O
remarked O
as O
a O
very O
plain O
child O
, O
which O
in O
reality O
she O
was O
not O
. O
Accustomed O
to O
hear O
beauty O
extolled O
above O
every O
thing O
else O
, O
beholding O
it O
in O
her O
mother O
and O
brother O
, O
and O
imagining O
it O
was O
Edward's S-PERSON
great O
beauty O
that O
always O
made O
him O
so O
beloved O
and O
petted O
, O
an O
evil O
- O
disposed O
child O
would O
have O
felt O
nothing O
but O
envy O
and O
dislike O
toward O
him O
. O
But O
Ellen S-PERSON
felt O
neither O
. O
She O
loved O
him O
devotedly O
| | O
but O
that O
any O
one O
could O
love O
her O
, O
now O
that O
the O
only O
one O
who O
ever O
had O
— O
her O
idolized O
father O
— O
was O
dead O
, O
she O
thought O
impossible O
. O
Why O
her O
heart O
and O
temples O
beat O
so O
quickly O
as O
she O
left O
her O
mother's O
room O
— O
why O
the O
promise O
she O
had O
so O
lately O
made O
should O
so O
cling O
to O
her O
mind O
, O
that O
even O
her O
aunt's O
arrival O
could O
not O
remove O
it O
— O
why O
she O
felt O
so O
giddy O
and O
weak O
as O
to O
render O
walking O
painful O
, O
the O
poor O
child O
could O
not O
have O
told O
, O
but O
, O
unable O
at O
length O
to O
go O
farther O
, O
she O
sat O
down O
on O
a O
grassy O
bank O
, O
and O
believing O
herself O
quite O
alone O
, O
cried O
bitterly O
. O
Several B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
passed O
and O
she O
did O
not O
look O
up O
, O
till O
a O
well O
- O
known O
voice O
inquired O
: O
— O

Dear O

what O

you O

indeed O
, O
I O
do O
not O
know O

dear O
Arthur S-PERSON

I O
only O
feel O
— O
feel O
— O
as O
if O
I O
had O
not O
so O
much O
strength O
as O
I O
had O
a O
few O
days O
ago O
— O
and O
, O
and O
I O
could O
not O
help O
crying O
. O
" O
" O
You O
are O
not O
well O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
" O
replied O
her O
companion O
, O
a O
fine O
lad O
of O
sixteen S-DATE
, O
and O
Mr. O
Myrvin's S-PERSON
only O
son O

" O
You O
are O
looking O
paler O
than O

you O
before O

me O
call O
my O
father O

You O
know O
he O
is O
always O
pleased O
when O
he O
sees O
you O

us O

me O

him O

" O
No O

Arthur S-PERSON
, O
indeed O
I O
can O
not O

will O

the O

me O

" O
And O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
all O
her O
efforts O
to O
restrain O
them O
, O
the O
tears O
would O
burst O
forth O
afresh O

and O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
finding O
all O
his O
efforts O
at O
consolation O
ineffectual O
, O
contented O
himself O
with O
putting O
his O
arm O
round O
her O
and O
kissing O
them O
away O
. O
A B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes E-TIME
afterward O
his O
father O
appeared O
. O
" O
In O
tears O
, O
my O
dear O
Ellen S-PERSON
! O
" O
he O
said O

kindly O

" O
your O

replied O
the O
child O
, O
as O
well O
as O
her O
tears O
would O
permit O

" O
she O
has O
been O
very O
ill O

her O

" O
Did O
any O

" O
" O
I O
think O
it O
was O
seeing O
my O
aunt O

Mamma S-PERSON
was O
very O
much O
agitated O
before O

afterward O

" O
" O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
has O
arrived O
then O
! O
I O
am O
rejoiced O
to O
hear O
it O
, O
" O
replied O
Mr. O
Myrvin S-PERSON
, O
gladly O
. O
Then O
sitting O
down O
by O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
he O
took O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
her O
hands O
in O
his O
, O
and O
said O
, O
kindly O
, O
" O
Something O
has O
grieved O
my O
little O
girl O
this O
evening O

I O
will O
not O
ask O
what O
it O
is O
, O
because O
you O
may O
not O
like O
to O
tell O
me O

but O
you O
must O
not O
imagine O
evils O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
. O
I O
know O
you O
have O
done O
, O
and O
are O
doing O
, O
the O
duty O
of O
a O
good O
, O
affectionate O
child O
, O
nursing O
your O
suffering O
mother O
, O
bearing O
with O
intervals O
of O
impatience O
, O
which O
her O
invalid O
state O
occasions O

giving O
up O
all O
your O
own O
wishes O

quietly O

her O

I O
have O
not O
seen O
you O

my O
child O

I O
know O
those O
who O
have O
, O
and O
this O
has O
pleased O
me O
, O
and O
, O
what O
is O
of O
much O
more O
consequence O
, O
it O
proves O
you O
have O
not O
forgotten O
all O
I O
told O
you O
of O
your O
Father O
in O
Heaven O
, O
that O
even O
a O
little O
child O
can O
try O
to O
love O

serve O
Him O

" O
" O
But O
have O
you O
not O
told O
me O
those O
who O
are O
good O
are O
always O
happy O
? O
" O
inquired O
Ellen S-PERSON

" O
then O
I O
can O
not O
be O
good O
, O
though O
indeed O
I O
try O
to O
be O
so O
, O
for O
I O
do O
not O
think O
I O
am O
happy O

for O
I O
can O
never O
laugh O
and O
sing O
and O
talk O
as O
Edward S-PERSON
does O
. O
" O
" O
You O
are O
not O
in O
such O
strong O
health O
as O
your O
brother O
, O
my O
dear O
little O
girl O
, O
and O
you O
have O
had O
many O
things O
to O
make O
you O
unhappy O
, O
which O
Edward S-PERSON
has O
not O
. O
But O
you O
must O
try O
and O
remember O
that O
even O
if O
it O
please O
God O
that O
sometimes O
you O
should O
be O
more O
sorrowful O
than O
other O
children O
, O
He O
loves O
you O
notwithstanding O
. O
I O
am O
sure O
you O
have O
not O
forgotten O
the O
story O
of O
Joseph S-PERSON
that O
I O
told O
you O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
Sundays I-DATE
ago E-DATE
. O
God O
so O
loved O
him O
, O
as O
to O
give O
him O
the O
power O
of O
foretelling O
future O
events O
, O
and O
enabling O
him O
to O
do O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
good O
, O
but O
when O
he O
was O
taken O
away O
from O
his O
father O
and O
sold O
as O
a O
slave O
and O
cast O
into O
prison O
among O
cruel O
strangers O
, O
he O
could O
not O
have O
been O
very O
happy O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
. O
Yet O
still O
, O
young O
as O
he O
was O
, O
little O
more O
than O
a O
child O
in O
those O
days O
, O
and O
thrown O
among O
those O
who O
did O
not O
know O
right O
from O
wrong O
, O
he O
remembered O
all O
that O
his O
father O
had O
taught O
him O
, O
and O
prayed O
to O
God O
, O
and O
tried O
to O
love O
and O
obey O
Him O
| | O
and O
God O
was O
pleased O
with O
him O
, O
and O
gave O
him O
grace O
to O
continue O
good O
, O
and O
at O
last O
so O
blessed O
him O
, O
as O
to O
permit O
him O
to O
see O
his O
dear O
father O
and O
darling O
brother O
again O
. O
" O
" O
But O
Joseph S-PERSON
was O
his O
father's O
favorite O
child O
, O
" O
was O
Ellen's S-PERSON
sole O
rejoinder O
| | O
and O
the O
tears O
which O
were O
checked O
in O
the O
eagerness O
with O
which O
she O
had O
listened O
, O
seemed O
again O
ready O
to O
burst O
forth O
. O
" O
He O
must O
have O
been O
happy O
when O
he O
thought O
of O
that O
. O
" O
" O
I O
do O
not O
think O
so O
, O
my O
dear O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
" O
replied O
Mr. O
Myrvin S-PERSON
, O
more O
moved O
than O
he O
chose O
to O
betray O
, O
" O
for O
being O
his O
father's O
favorite O
first S-ORDINAL
excited O
the O
dislike O
and O
envy O
of O
his O
brothers O
, O
and O
caused O
them O
to O
wish O
to O
send O
him O
away O
. O
There O
was O
no O
excuse O
indeed O
for O
their O
conduct O
| | O
but O
perhaps O
if O
Joseph S-PERSON
had O
always O
remained O
near O
his O
father O
he O
might O
have O
been O
spoiled O
by O
too O
great O
indulgence O
, O
and O
never O
become O
as O
good O
as O
he O
afterward O
was O
. O
Perhaps O
in O
his O
solitary O
prison O
he O
might O
even O
have O
regretted O
that O
his O
father O
had O
not O
treated O
them O
all O
alike O
, O
as O
then O
the O
angry O
feelings O
of O
his O
brothers O
would O
not O
have O
been O
called O
forth O
. O
So O
you O
see O
, O
being O
a O
favorite O
will O
not O
always O
make O
us O
happy O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
. O
It O
is O
indeed O
very O
delightful O
to O
be O
loved O
and O
caressed O
, O
and O
if O
we O
try O
to O
do O
our O
duty O
and O
love O
as O
much O
as O
we O
can O
, O
even O
if O
we O
are O
not O
sure O
of O
being O
loved O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
, O
we O
may O
be O
quite O
certain O
that O
we O
shall O
be O
loved O
and O
happy O
at O
last O
. O
Do O
you O
understand O
me O
, O
my O
child O
? O
" O
The O
question O
was O
almost O
needless O
, O
for O
Ellen's S-PERSON
large O
eyes O
had O
never O
moved O
from O
his O
face O
, O
and O
their O
expression O
was O
so O
full O
of O
intelligence O
and O
meaning O
, O
that O
the O
whole O
countenance O
seemed O
lighted O
up O
. O
" O
Then O
do O
you O
think O
mamma O
will O
recover O
? O
" O
she O
eagerly O
exclaimed O

" O
will O
she O
ever O
love O
me O
? O
— O
oh O
, O
if O
I O
thought O
so O
, O
I O
could O
never O
, O
never O
be O
naughty O
again O
! O
" O
" O
She O
will O
love O
you O
, O
my O
dear O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
" O
replied O
Mr. O
Myrvin S-PERSON
, O
now O
visibly O
affected O
, O
" O
I O
can O
not O
, O
I O
dare O
not O
tell O
you O
that O
she O
will O
recover O
to O
love O
you O
on O
earth O
, O
but O
if O
indeed O
it O
be O
God's O
will O
that O
she O
should O
go O
to O
Him O
, O
she O
will O
look O
down O
on O
you O
from O
Heaven O

love O
you O
far O
more O
than O
she O
has O
done O

she O
will O
know O

how O
much O
you O

all O

help O

in O
a O
low O
, O
half S-CARDINAL

frightened O
voice O

and O
little O
did O
Mr. O
Myrvin S-PERSON
imagine O
how O
vividly O
and O
how O
indelibly O
his O
reply O
was O
registered O
in O
the O
child's O
memory O
. O
" O
It O
is O
a O
question O
none O
can O
answer O
positively O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
but O
it O
is O
my O
own O
firm O
belief O
, O
that O
the O
beloved O
ones O
we O
have O
lost O
are O
permitted O
to O
watch O
over O
and O
love O
us O
still O
, O
and O
that O
they O
see O
us O
, O
and O
are O
often O
near O
us O
, O
though O
we O
can O
not O
see O
them O

But O
even O
to O
help O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
" O
he O
continued O
somewhat O
anxiously O
, O
" O
you O
must O
not O
be O
tempted O
— O
" O
He O
was O
interrupted O
by O
the O
appearance O
of O
a O
stranger O
, O
who O
addressing O
him O
courteously O
, O
apologized O
for O
his O
intrusion O
, O
and O
noticing O
the O
children O
, O
inquired O
if O
both O
were O
his O
. O
Mr. O
Myrvin S-PERSON
replied O
that O
he O
could O
only O
lay O
claim O
to O
one O

the O
little O
girl O
was O
Miss O
Fortescue S-PERSON
. O
" O
And O
my O
name O
is O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
so O
I O
think O
I O
have O
an O
uncle's O
privilege O
, O
" O
was O
the O
reply O

and O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
to O
her O
astonishment O
, O
received O
an O
affectionate O
embrace O
from O
the O
unknown O
relative O
, O
whom O
her O
mother's O
ill O
- O
judged O
words O
had O
taught O
her O
actually O
to O
dread O
. O
Mr. O
Myrvin S-PERSON
gladly O
welcomed O
him O
, O
and O
, O
in O
the O
interest O
of O
the O
conversation O
which O
followed O
, O
forgot O
the O
lesson O
he O
had O
been O
so O
anxious O
to O
impress O
upon O
Ellen S-PERSON
. O
Arthur S-PERSON
accompanied O
her O
to O
the O
garden O
gate O
, O
and O
the O
gentlemen O
soon O
afterward O
entered O
the O
cottage O
together O
. O
Days S-DATE
merged O
into O
weeks S-DATE
, O
and O
still O
Mrs. O
Fortescue S-PERSON
lingered O
| | O
but O
her O
weakness O
increasing O
so O
painfully O
from O
alternate O
fever O
and O
exhaustion O
that O
to O
remove O
her O
was O
impossible O
. O
It O
was O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
that O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
had O
ever O
been O
separated O
from O
her O
children O
, O
and O
there O
were O
many O
disagreeables O
attendant O
on O
nursing O
a O
beloved O
invalid O
in O
that O
confined O
cottage O

and O
with O
only O
those O
little O
luxuries O
and O
comforts O
that O
could O
be O
procured O
( O
and O
even O
these O
were O
obtained O
with O
difficulty O
, O
for O
the O
nearest O
town O
was O
twenty B-QUANTITY
miles E-QUANTITY
distant O
) O
, O
but O
not O
a O
selfish O
or O
repining O
thought O
entered O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
mind O
. O
It O
was O
filled O
with O
thankfulness O
, O
not O
only O
that O
she O
was O
permitted O
thus O
to O
tend O
a O
sister O
, O
whom O
neither O
error O
, O
nor O
absence O
, O
nor O
silence O
could O
estrange O
from O
her O
heart O
, O
but O
that O
she O
was O
spared O
long O
enough O
for O
her O
gentle O
influence O
and O
enduring O
love O
to O
have O
some O
effect O
in O
changing O
her O
train O
of O
thought O
, O
calming O
that O
fearful O
irritability O
, O
and O
by O
slow O
degrees O
permitting O
her O
to O
look O
with O
resignation O
and O
penitent O
hope O
to O
that B-TIME
hour E-TIME
which O
no O
human O
effort O
could O
avert O
. O
That O
Mr. O
Myrvin S-PERSON
should O
seek O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
society O
and O
delight O
in O
conversing O
with O
her O
, O
Mrs. O
Fortescue S-PERSON
considered O
so O
perfectly O
natural O
, O
that O
the O
conversations O
which O
took O
place O
in O
her O
sick O
room O
, O
whenever O
she O
was O
strong O
enough O
to O
bear O
them O
, O
excited O
neither O
surprise O
nor O
impatience O
. O
Different O
as O
she O
was O
, O
willfully O
as O
she O
had O
always O
neglected O
the O
mild O
counsels O
and O
example O
of O
her O
sister O
, O
the O
years O
of O
separation O
and O
but O
too O
often O
excited O
self O
- O
reproach O
had O
fully O
awakened O
her O
to O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
superiority O
. O
She O
had O
never O
found O
any O
one O
at O
all O
like O
her O
— O
so O
good O
and O
holy O
, O
yet O
so O
utterly O
unassuming O
| | O
and O
the O
strong O
affection O
, O
even O
the O
deep O
emotion O
in O
one O
usually O
so O
controlled O
, O
with O
which O
her O
sister O
had O
met O
her O
, O
naturally O
increased O
these O
feelings O
. O
" O
Ah O
, O
you O
and O
Emmeline S-PERSON
will O
find O
much O
to O
converse O
about O
, O
" O
had O
been O
her O
address O
to O
Mr. O
Myrvin S-PERSON
, O
on O
his O
first S-ORDINAL
introduction O
to O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
. O
" O
Talk O
as O
much O
as O
you O
please O
, O
and O
do O
not O
mind O
me O
. O
With O
Emmeline S-PERSON
near O
me O
, O
I O
can O
restrain O
irritability O
which O
must O
have O
frightened O
you O
away O
. O
I O
know O
she O
is O
right O

Oh O
, O
would O
to O
God O
I O
had O
always O
been O
like O
her O
! O
" O
and O
the O
suffering O
betrayed O
in O
the O
last O
words O
was O
a O
painful O
contrast O
with O
the O
lightness O
of O
her O
previous O
tone O
. O
Mr. O
Myrvin S-PERSON
answered O
soothingly O
, O
and O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
his O
words O
were O
patiently O
received O

From O
listening O
listlessly O
, O
Mrs. O
Fortescue S-PERSON
, O
by O
slow O
degrees O
, O
became O
interested O
in O
the O
conversations O
between O
him O
and O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
and O
so O
a O
change O
in O
sentiments O
was O
gradually O
wrought O
, O
which O
by O
any O
other O
and O
harsher O
method O
of O
proceeding O
would O
have O
been O
sought O
for O
in O
vain O
. O
One B-TIME
evening E-TIME
as O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
sat O
watching O
the O
faded O
countenance O
of O
her O
patient O
, O
and O
recalling O
those B-DATE
days E-DATE
of O
youth O
and O
buoyancy O
, O
when O
it O
seemed O
as O
if O
neither O
death O
nor O
care O
could O
ever O
have O
assailed O
one O
so O
bright O
and O
lovely O
, O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
before O
he O
sought O
his O
favorite O
stream O
, O
threw O
his O
arms O
round O
her O
neck O
, O
and O
pressed O
his O
rosy O
lips O
on O
her O
cheek O
, O
as O
thus O
to O
wish O
her O
good O

his O

with O
a O
heavy O
sigh O

left O
the O

Ellen S-PERSON
you O

" O
" O
Are O
the O

fancied O

off O

never O

reserved O
from O

I O
never O
could O
feel O
the O

toward O
her O
as O
I O
did O
toward O
Edward S-PERSON

therefore O
there O
must O

something O
in O
Ellen S-PERSON

prevent O
it O

" O
Mrs. O

did O
not O

gently O

Are O
you O
quite O
sure O
, O
my O
dear O
Eleanor S-PERSON

that O
you O
have O
equally O
studied O
the O
characters O
of O
both O
your O
children O

because O
you O
know O
there O
are O
some O
cases O

require O
more O
study O
and O
carefulness O
than O
others O

" O
" O
I O
never O
was O
fond O

studying O
any O
thing O

Emmeline S-PERSON

as O
you O
may O
remember O
, O
" O
replied O
Mrs. O
Fortescue S-PERSON
, O
painfully O
trying O
to O
smile O
, O
" O
and O
therefore O
I O
dare O
say O
I O
have O
not O
studied O
my O
children O
as O
you O
have O
yours O
. O
Besides O
, O
you O
know O
I O
always O
thought O
, O
and O
still O
think O
, O
the O
doctrine O
of O
mothers O
forming O
the O
characters O
of O
their O
children O
, O
and O
all O
that O
good O
people O
say O
about O
the O
importance O
of O
early O
impressions O

perfectly O
ridiculous O

The O
disposition O
for O
good O

bad O

loving O
or O
unloving O
, O
is O
theirs O
from O
the O
moment O
of O
their O
birth O

and O
what O
human O
efforts O
can O
alter O
that O
? O
Why O
, O
the O
very O
infancy O
of O
my O
children O
was O
different O

Edward S-PERSON
was O
always O
laughing O
, O
and O
animated O
, O
and O
happy O

Ellen S-PERSON
fretful O
and O
peevish O
, O
and O
so O
heavy O
that O
she O
never O
seemed O
even O
to O
know O
when O
I O
entered O
the O
room O
, O
while O
Edward S-PERSON
would O
spring O
into O
my O
arms O
, O

shout O

laugh O
only O
to O
see O
me O
. O
Now O
what O
conduct O
on O
my O
part O
could O
have O
done O
this O
? O
Surely O
I O
was O
justified O
in O
feeling O
differently O
toward O
such O
opposite O
dispositions O

and O
I O
know O
I O
never O
made O
more O
difference O

than O
papa O
did O
between O
us O

Emmeline S-PERSON

have O
had O
greater O
reason O
to O
be O
partial O

better O

ceased O

the O

Mrs. O

with O

continued O

natural O
impetuosity O
for O

my O
God O

my O
God O
! O
Death O
may O
indeed O
be O
merciful O

my O
Edward S-PERSON
might O
do O
the O
same O
by O
me O

" O
and O
, O
shuddering O
violently O
, O
she O
hid O
her O
face O
on O
her O
sister's O
bosom O
. O
It O
was O
long O
before O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
could O
calm O
that O
fearful O
agitation O
, O
long O
before O
her O
whispered O
words O
of O
heavenly O
hope O
, O
and O
peace O
, O
and O
pardon O
— O
if O
indeed O
she O
believed O
— O
could O
bring O
comfort O

but O
they O
did O
at O
length O
, O
and O
such O
fearful O
paroxysms O
returned O
at O
longer O
and O
longer O
intervals O
, O
and O
at O
length O
ceased O
, O
in O
the O
deep O
submission O
and O
clinging O
trust O
to O
which O
she O
was O
at O
last O
permitted O
to O
attain O
. O
Though O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
was O
detained O
six B-DATE
weeks E-DATE
at O
Llangwillan S-GPE
, O
her O
devoted O
attendance O
on O
her O
sister O
prevented O
any O
thing O
more O
than O
occasional O
observation O
of O
the O
children O
so O
soon O
about O
to O
be O
committed O
to O
her O
care O
. O
That O
Edward S-PERSON
was O
most O
engaging O
, O
and O
riveted O
her O
affection O
at O
once O
, O
and O
that O
Ellen S-PERSON
was O
unlike O
any O
child O
she O
had O
ever O
known O
or O
seen O
, O
she O
could O
not O
but O
feel O
, O
but O
she O
was O
not O
one O
to O
decide O
on O
a O
mere O
feeling O
. O
Her O
present O
mournful O
task O
prevented O
all O
actual O
interference O
with O
them O
, O
except O
the O
endeavor O
by O
kindly O
notice O
to O
win O
their O
confidence O
and O
love O
. O
His O
mother's O
illness O
and O
his O
uncle's O
presence O
, O
besides O
, O
for O
the O
present O
, O
his O
perfect O
freedom O
with O
regard O
to O
employment O
, O
had O
deprived O
Edward S-PERSON
of O
all O
inclination O
to O
rebel O
or O
exert O
his O
self O
- O
will O
, O
and O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
both O
felt O
that O
he O
certainly O
had O
fewer O
faults O
, O
than O
was O
generally O
the O
consequence O
of O
unlimited O
indulgence O
. O
Whether O
Ellen's S-PERSON
extreme O
attention O
to O
her O
mother O
, O
her O
silent O
but O
ever O
ready O
help O
when O
her O
aunt O
required O
it O
, O
proceeded O
from O
mere O
cold O
duty O
, O
or O
really O
had O
its O
origin O
in O
affection O
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
could O
not O
satisfactorily O
decide O
. O
Her O
sister O
had O
avowed O
partiality O
, O
but O
that O
neglect O
and O
unkindness O
could O
have O
been O
shown O
to O
such O
an O
extent O
by O
a O
mother O
as O
to O
create O
the O
cold O
exterior O
she O
beheld O
, O
was O
so O
utterly O
incomprehensible O
, O
so O
opposed O
to O
every O
dictate O
of O
maternal O
love O
, O
which O
she O
knew O
so O
well O
, O
that O
she O
actually O
could O
not O
even O
imagine O
it O
. O
She O
could O
believe O
in O
the O
possibility O
of O
a O
preference O
for O
one S-CARDINAL
child O
more O
than O
another O
, O
but O
not O
in O
utter O
neglect O
and O
actual O
dislike O
. O
She O
could O
imagine O
that O
Ellen's S-PERSON
love O
for O
her O
mother O
might O
be O
less O
warm O
than O
Edward's S-PERSON
, O
believing O
, O
as O
she O
did O
, O
that O
a O
parent O
must O
call O
for O
a O
child's O
affection O
, O
not O
be O
satisfied O
with O
leaving O
all O
to O
Nature O
| | O
but O
if O
it O
were O
not O
love O
that O
dictated O
Ellen's S-PERSON
conduct O
, O
it O
was O
strange O
and O
almost O
unnatural O
, O
and O
so O
unpleasing O
, O
that O
so O
young O
a O
child O
should O
have O
such O
an O
idea O
of O
duty O
. O
But O
these O
were O
only O
passing O
thoughts O
| | O
cost O
what O
trouble O
it O
might O
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
determined O
she O
would O
understand O
her O
niece O
as O
she O
did O
her O
own O
children O
. O
But O
though O
to O
her O
Ellen S-PERSON
was O
a O
riddle O
, O
to O
her O
sister O
Nature S-PERSON
was O
resuming O
her O
sway O
, O
too O
late O
, O
alas O
! O
for O
all O
, O
save O
the O
mother's O
own O
reproaches O
. O
Her O
weakness O
had O
become O
such O
that O
days O
would O
pass O
when O
speech O
, O
save O
a O
few O
whispered O
words O
, O
was O
impossible O
| | O
but O
she O
would O
gaze O
upon O
her O
child O
, O
as O
hour B-TIME
after I-TIME
hour E-TIME
she O
would O
sit O
by O
the O
bed O
, O
resisting O
all O
Edward's S-PERSON
entreaties O
, O
and O
sometimes O
even O
her O
aunt's O
to O
go O
and O
play O
, O
and O
long O
to O
fold O
her O
to O
her O
heart O
, O
and O
confess O
she O
had O
been O
cruelly O
unjust O
, O
and O
that O
she O
did O
love O
her O
now O
almost O
as O
much O
as O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
but O
she O
was O
much O
too O
weak O
to O
do O
more O
than O
feel O
. O
And O
Ellen S-PERSON
remained O
unconscious O
of O
the O
change O
, O
except O
that O
now O
and O
then O
, O
as O
she O
would O
bring O
her O
nourishment O
or O
bend O
over O
to O
bathe O
her O
forehead O
, O
her O
mother O
would O
, O
as O
if O
involuntarily O
, O
kiss O
her O
cheek O
and O
murmur O
some O
caressing O
word O
. O
And O
Ellen S-PERSON
longed O
to O
cling O
to O
her O
neck O
and O
say O
how O
much O
she O
loved O
her O
, O
but O
she O
did O
not O
dare O
and O
she O
would O
hurry O
out O
of O
the O
room O
to O
conceal O
her O
tears O
, O
instead O
of O
returning O
the O
caress O
, O
thus O
unhappily O
confirming O
the O
idea O
of O
natural O
coldness O
. O
Even O
the O
comfort O
of O
sitting O
by O
her O
mother O
was O
at O
length O
denied O
her O
. O
Mrs. O
Fortescue S-PERSON
became O
so O
alarmingly O
and O
painfully O
ill O
, O
that O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
felt O
it O
an O
unnecessary O
trial O
for O
her O
children O
to O
witness O
it O
, O
especially O
as O
they O
could O
be O
no O
comfort O
to O
her O
, O
for O
she O
did O
not O
know O
them O
. O
The O
evening O
of O
the B-DATE
fourth I-DATE
day E-DATE
she O
recovered O
sufficiently O
to O
partake O
of O
the O
sacrament O
with O
her O
sister O
and O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
and O
then O
entreat O
that O
her O
children O
might O
be O
brought O
to O
her O
. O
She O
felt O
herself O
, O
what O
the O
physician O
had O
imparted O
to O
her O
sister O
, O
that O
the O
recovery O
of O
her O
senses O
would O
in O
all O
human O
probability O
be O
followed O
in O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
hours E-TIME
by O
death O
, O
and O
her O
last O
thoughts O
were O
on O
them O
. O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
full O
of O
glee O
at O
being O
permitted O
to O
see O
her O
again O
, O
bounded O
joyfully O
into O
the O
room O
, O
but O
the O
fearful O
change O
in O
that O
beloved O
face O
so O
startled O
and O
terrified O
him O
, O
that O
he O
uttered O
a O
loud O
cry O
, O
and O
throwing O
himself O
beside O
her O
, O
sobbed O
upon O
her O
bosom O
. O
Mrs. O
Fortescue S-PERSON
was O
fearfully O
agitated O
, O
but O
she O
conjured O
her O
sister O
not O
to O
take O
him O
from O
her O
, O
and O
her O
heavy O
eyes O
wandered O
painfully O
round O
the O
room O
in O
search O
of O
Ellen S-PERSON
. O
" O
Come O
to O
me O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
I O
have O
done O
you O
injustice O
, O
my O
sweet O
child O
, O
" O
she O
murmured O
in O
a O
voice O
that O
Ellen S-PERSON
never O
in O
her O
life O
forgot O
, O
and O
she O
clung O
to O
her O
in O
silent O
agony O
. O
" O
I O
have O
not O
done O
my O
duty O
to O
you O
, O
I O
know O

feel O
I O

not O

it O
is O
too O
late O
now O
to O
atone O

I O
can O
only O
pray O
God O
to O

you O

raise O
you O
up O

kinder O
parent O

I O
have O
been O
! O
Bless O
, O
bless O
you O
both O

" O
Faintness O
overpowered O
her O
, O
and O
she O
lay O
for O
several B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
powerless O
, O
in O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
arms O
. O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
in O
passionate O
grief O
, O
refused O
to O
stir O
from O
the O
bed O

and O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
almost O
unconsciously O
, O
sunk O
on O
her O
knees O
by O
Mr. O
Myrvin S-PERSON

" O
My O

Saviour O

were O
the O
broken O
sentences O
that O
, O
in O
a O
voice O
which O
was O
scarcely O
audible O

and O
uttered O
at O
long O
intervals O
, O
escaped O
Mrs. O
Fortescue's S-PERSON
lips O

and O
then O
her O
head O
sunk O
lower O
on O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
bosom O
, O
and O
there O
was O
a O
long O
, O
long O
silence O
, O
broken O
only O
by O
Edward's O
low O
and O
half O
- O
suffocated O
sobs O
. O
And O
he O
knew O
not O
, O
guessed O
not O
, O
the O
grief O
that O
was O
impending O
. O
He O
only O
felt O
that O
his O
mother O
was O
worse O

not O
better O
, O
as O
he O
had O
believed O

must O
be O
, O
when O
his O
aunt O
arrived O

He O
had O
never O
seen O
death O

though O
Ellen S-PERSON
had O

he O
had O
passionately O

willfully O
refused O
either O

his O

Mr. O
Myrvin's S-PERSON
gentle O

prepare O
him O
for O
his O
loss O

Terrified O
at O
the O
continued O
silence O
, O
at O
the O
cold O
heavy O
feel O
of O
his O
mother's O
hand O
, O
as O
, O
when O
Mr. O
Myrvin S-PERSON

the O
widow O
gently O
removed O
her O
from O
the O
still O

supporting O
arm O

fell O
against O

started O
up O

clinging O

his O
aunt O

implored O
her O

tell O
him O
why O
his O

drew O
her O

And O
even O
the O
natural O
awe O

terror O
of O
death O
gave O
way O
before O
his O
grief O

clung O
to O
the O
body O
of O
his O
mother O
so O
passionately O

so O
convulsively O

required O

remove O
him O

for O
hours O
his O
aunt O

watched O
over O

tried O
to O
soothe O

comfort O
him O

acquitted O
her O
unconsciously O

, O
his O
very O
grief O
caused O
her O
to O
love O

admire O
him O
still O
more O

believe O

they O
did O
the B-DATE
second I-DATE
day E-DATE
after O
Mrs. O
Fortescue's S-PERSON
funeral O
, O
Edward S-PERSON
could O
laugh O

talk O
as O
usual O
— O
except O
when O
any O
object O
recalled O
his O
mother O

and O
poor O
Ellen S-PERSON
felt O
that O
though O
she O
had O
fancied O
she O
was O
not O
happy O
before O

she O
was O
much O
more O
unhappy O
now O
. O
Her O
fancy O
naturally O
vivid O
, O
and O
rendered O
more O
so O
from O
her O
having O
been O
left O
so O
much O
to O
herself O
, O
dwelt O
morbidly O
on O
all O
that O
had O
passed O
in O
her O
mother's O
illness O
, O
on O
every O
caress O
, O
every O
unusual O
word O
of O
affection O

and O
on O
Mr. O
Myrvin's S-PERSON
assurance O
that O

would O
love O
her O
in O
Heaven O

the O
promise O

had O
made O

returned O
to O
her O
memory O
again O

again O
, O
and O
each O
time O
with O
the O
increased O
determination O
to O
keep O
it O
solemnly O
. O
It O
was O
not O
for O
her O
mother's O
sake O
alone O
, O
and O
connected O
only O
with O
her O
| | O
perhaps O
, O
had O
it O
not O
been O
for O
the O
careful O
instructions O
of O
her O
father O
, O
whom O
, O
as O
we O
shall O
presently O
see O
, O
she O
had O
cause O
almost O
to O
idolize O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
might O
have O
become O
indifferent O
to O
her O
mother O
and O
envious O
of O
Edward S-PERSON
. O
But O
his O
repeated O
instructions O
, O
under O
all O
circumstances O
to O
love O
, O
cherish O
, O
and O
obey O
her O
mother O
had O
been O
indelibly O
engraved O
, O
and O
heightened O
natural O
feeling O
. O
She O
believed O
that O
to O
keep O
the O
promise O
, O
which O
had O
so O
evidently O
pleased O
her O
mother O
, O
would O
be O
also O
obeying O
her O
father O
, O
and O
this O
double O
incentive O
gave O
it O
a O
weight O
and O
consequence O
, O
which O
, O
could O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
have O
known O
it O
, O
would O
have O
caused O
her O
great O
anxiety O
, O
and O
urged O
its O
removal O
. O
But O
Ellen S-PERSON
had O
been O
too O
long O
accustomed O
to O
hide O
every O
thought O
and O
feeling O
to O
betray O
that O
which O
, O
child O
as O
she O
was O
, O
she O
believed O
sacred O
between O
herself O
and O
her O
mother O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
watched O
her O
in O
silence O
, O
and O
trusted O
to O
time O
and O
care O
to O
do O
their O
work O
| | O
and O
by O
enabling O
her O
to O
understand O
her O
character O
, O
permit O
her O
to O
guide O
it O
rightly O
. O
The O
morning O
of O
their O
intended O
departure O
was O
bright O
and O
sunny O
, O
and O
before O
even O
widow O
Morgan S-PERSON
was O
moving O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
had O
quitted O
her O
little O
bed O
and O
was O
in O
the O
churchyard O
by O
her O
mother's O
grave O
. O
She O
sat O
there O
thinking O
so O
intently O
, O
that O
she O
did O
not O
know O
how O
time O
passed O
, O
till O
she O
was O
roused O
by O
her O
favorite O
Arthur B-PERSON
Myrvin's E-PERSON
voice O
. O
" O
Up O
so O
early O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
why O
, O
I O
thought O
I O
should O
have O
been O
first S-ORDINAL
, O
to O
show O
you O
I O
had O
not O
forgotten O
my O
promise O

" O
And O
he O
displayed O
some O
choice O
flower O
- O
roots O
, O
which O
he O
commenced O
planting O
round O
the O
grave O
. O
" O
Dear O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
how O
very O
kind O
you O
are O

you O
look O
so O
sad O
— O
what O
is O
the O
matter O
? O
Does O
not O
Mr. O
Myrvin S-PERSON
like O
you O
to O
do O
this O

pray O
don't O

then O
. O
" O
" O
No O
, O
no O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
my O
father O
said O
I O
was O
right O
, O
and O
that O
he O
would O
take O
care O
of O
the O
flowers O
also O
himself O
. O
I O
am O
only O
sorry O
you O
are O
going O
away O

to O
live O
so O
differently O
to O
what O
we O
do O

you O
will O
quite O
forget O
me O

" O
Indeed O
, O
indeed O
I O
shall O
not O
, O
dear O
Arthur S-PERSON

I O
can O
never O
forget O
those O
who O

been O
so O
kind O
to O
me O
as O
you O
and O
dear O
Mr. O
Myrvin S-PERSON

I O
would O
much O
rather O
stay O
here O
always O
with O
you O
, O
than O
go O
among O
strangers O
again O
, O
but O
I O
heard O
my O
aunt O
say O
last B-TIME
night E-TIME
, O
that O
perhaps O
Mr. O
Myrvin S-PERSON
would O
let O
you O
come O
and O
see O
us O
sometimes O
— O
and O
you O
will O
like O
that O
, O
will O
you O
not O
? O
" O
Arthur S-PERSON
did O
not O
seem O
quite O
sure O
whether O
he O
would O
like O
it O
or O
not O

but O
they O
continued O
talking O
till O
his O
task O
was O
completed O
, O
and O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
at O
Ellen's S-ORG
earnest O
request O
, O
for O
she O
suddenly O
feared O
her O
aunt O
would O
be O
displeased O
at O
her O
having O
staid O
out O
so O
long O
, O
returned O
with O
her O
to O
the O
cottage O

the O
silent O
kiss O
, O
however O
, O
which O
she O
received O
, O
when O
Arthur S-PERSON
explained O
what O
had O
detained O
them O
, O
reassured O
her O
, O
and O
bound O
her O
yet O
closer O
to O
the O
kind O
relative O
, O
whom O
, O
if O
timidity O
had O
permitted O
, O
she O
would O
already O
have O
so O
loved O

The O
novelty O
of O
his O
situation O
, O
the O
rapid O
and O
pleasant O
movement O
of O
his O
uncle's O
carriage O

the O
idea O
of O
the O
new O
relations O

was O
about O
to O
meet O

an O
unconfessed O

powerful O
feeling O

increased O
consequence O
in O
being O
so O
nearly O
connected O
with O
wealth O

distinction O

all O
had O
their O
effect O
upon O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
and O
his O
eye O
sparkled O
and O
his O
cheek O
glowed O
, O
as O
if O
all O
sorrow O
had O
entirely O
passed O
away O

to O
think O
of O
his O
mother O

for O
the O
least O
reference O

fill O
his O
eyes O

completely O
check O
his O
joy O

still O
delight O
predominated O

Ellen S-PERSON
felt O
more O

more O
the O
wish O

shrunk O

looked O
intently O

silently O
out O
from O

on O
the O
contrary O

so O
gifted O

most O

want O

, O
of O
common O
respect O

a O
resolute O
opposition O
from O
her O
earliest O
years O
to O
the O
wishes O
of O
Mrs. O
Harcourt S-PERSON
, O
because O
she O
was O
merely O
a O
governess O
, O
so O
much O
her O
inferior O
in O
rank O
, O
rendered O
the O
task O
of O
education O
one O
of O
the O
most O
difficult O
and O
painful O
that O
can O
be O
conceived O
— O
increased O
from O
the O
injudicious O
partiality O
of O
Lord O
Delmont S-PERSON
. O
It O
was O
not O
indeed O
the O
culpable O
negligence O
and O
dislike O
which O
Eleanor S-PERSON
afterward O
displayed O
toward O
her O
own O
, O
but O
originating O
in O
the O
fancy O
that O
Mrs. O
Harcourt S-PERSON
was O
unjust O
, O
and O
Emmeline S-PERSON
was O
her O
favorite O
. O
Lord O
Delmont S-PERSON
was O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
those O
unfortunately O
weak O
, O
irresolute O
characters O
, O
that O
only O
behold O
the O
surface O
of O
things O
, O
and O
are O
therefore O
utterly O
incapable O
of O
acting O
either O
with O
vigor O
or O
judgment O
. O
When O
he O
did O
venture O
into O
the O
precincts O
of O
his O
daughters' O
apartments O
, O
he O
generally O
found O
Eleanor S-PERSON
in O
sobs O
and O
tears O
, O
and O
Emmeline S-PERSON
quietly O
pursuing O
her O
daily O
duties O
. O
That O
Mrs. O
Harcourt S-PERSON
often O
entreated O
his O
influence O
with O
her O
younger O
pupil O
, O
to O
change O
her O
course O
of O
conduct O
, O
he O
never O
remembered O
longer O
than O
the O
time O
her O
expostulations O
lasted O
. O
Once O
or O
twice O
indeed O
he O
did O
begin O
to O
speak O
seriously O
, O
but O
Eleanor S-PERSON
would O
throw O
her O
arms O
round O
his O
neck O
and O
kiss O
him O
, O
call O
him O
every O
endearing O
name O
, O
and O
beg O
him O
not O
to O
look O
so O
much O
like O
grave O
, O
cross O
Mrs. O
Harcourt S-PERSON
, O
or O
she O
should O
think O
she O
had O
indeed O
no O
one O
to O
love O
her O
| | O
and O
her O
beautiful O
eyes O
would O
swell O
with O
tears O
, O
and O
her O
voice O
quiver O
, O
so O
that O
her O
gratified O
father O
would O
forget O
all O
his O
reproof O
, O
and O
give O
her O
some O
indulgence O
to O
make O
up O
for O
the O
injustice O
and O
harshness O
she O
encountered O
in O
the O
school O
- O
room O
. O
Her O
power O
once O
thus O
experienced O
, O
of O
course O
, O
was O
never O
resigned O
. O
Her O
father's O
appearance O
in O
their O
study O
was O
always O
the O
signal O
for O
her O
tears O
, O
which O
she O
knew O
would O
confirm O
all O
his O
ideas O
of O
Mrs. O
Harcourt's S-PERSON
unjust O
partiality O
. O
And O
this O
idea O
was O
strengthened O
as O
they O
grew O
older O
, O
and O
masters O
for O
various O
accomplishments O
somewhat O
lightened O
Mrs. O
Harcourt's S-PERSON
actual O
labors O
. O
Emmeline's S-PERSON
steady O
application O
, O
and O
moderate O
abilities O
were O
lost O
sight O
of O
in O
the O
applause O
always O
elicited O
by O
her O
younger O
sister O
| | O
whose O
natural O
gifts O
alike O
in O
music O
, O
languages O
, O
and O
drawing O
had O
full O
play O
, O
directly O
she O
was O
released O
, O
even O
in O
part O
, O
from O
the O
hated O
thralldom O
of O
her O
governess O
. O
— O
Lord O
Delmont S-PERSON
had O
been O
accustomed O
to O
hear O
Eleanor's S-PERSON
beauty O
extolled O
, O
and O
now O
the O
extraordinary O
versatility O
and O
brilliancy O
of O
her O
talents O
became O
the O
theme O
of O
every O
tongue O
. O
Professors O
are O
naturally O
proud O
of O
a O
pupil O
who O
does O
them O
more O
than O
justice O
, O
and O
Miss O
Eleanor B-PERSON
Manvers E-PERSON
was O
in O
consequence O
held O
up O
in O
very O
many O
families O
, O
whom O
Lord O
Delmont S-PERSON
only O
casually O
knew O
, O
and O
spoken O
of O
by O
very O
many O
again O
to O
him O
, O
knowing O
his O
weak O
point O
, O
and O
thus O
seeking O
to O
curry O
favor O
. O
Mrs. O
Harcourt S-PERSON
was O
the O
only O
one O
from O
whom O
he O
never O
heard O
Eleanor's S-PERSON
praises O
, O
and O
the O
only O
one O
, O
who O
spoke O
in O
praise O
of O
Emmeline S-PERSON
. O
It O
must O
then O
be O
willful O
blindness O
on O
her O
part O
| | O
and O
the O
father O
felt O
indignant O
, O
but O
in O
spite O
of O
himself O
had O
too O
much O
real O
respect O
for O
her O
, O
individually O
, O
to O
do O
more O
than O
redouble O
his O
indulgence O
to O
Eleanor S-PERSON
. O
Emmeline S-PERSON
could O
not O
complain O
of O
her O
father's O
neglect O
, O
for O
he O
was O
both O
kind O
and O
affectionate O
to O
her O
| | O
but O
she O
did O
sometimes O
wish O
she O
could O
be O
quite O
sure O
that O
he O
loved O
her O
as O
much O
as O
her O
sister O

and O
her O
deep O
affections O
, O
unsuspected O
by O
her O
father O
, O
rejected O
and O
laughed O
at O
by O
Eleanor S-PERSON
, O
twined O
themselves O
closer O
and O
closer O
round O
Mrs. O
Harcourt S-PERSON
, O
and O
her O
brother O
Charles S-PERSON
, O
on O
whom O
she O
actually O
doted O
, O
and O
who O
returned O
her O
affection O
with O
one O
quite O
as O
fond O
and O
warm O
as O
a O
happy O
, O
laughter O
- O
loving O
, O
frank O
- O
hearted O
boy O
had O
it O
in O
his O
power O
to O
bestow O

yet O
even O
his O
holidays O
were O
times O
of O
as O
much O
suffering O
as O
joy O
to O
his O
sister O
, O
from O
the O
violent O
quarrels O
which O
were O
continually O
taking O
place O
between O
him O
and O
Eleanor S-PERSON
. O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
happy O
in O
herself O
and O
Mrs. O
Harcourt's S-PERSON
companionship O
, O
could O
endure O
Eleanor's S-PERSON
determined O
supremacy O
, O
and O
, O
except O
where O
her O
conscience O
disapproved O
, O
yielded O
to O
her O
. O
But O
this O
could O
not O
be O
expected O
from O
Charles S-PERSON
, O
who O
, O
despite O
his O
elder O
sister's O
gentle O
entreaties O
, O
would O
stand O
up O
for O
what O
he O
called O
her O
rights O
, O
and O
declare O
that O
, O
when O
he O
was O
at O
home O
, O
Miss O
Eleanor S-PERSON
should O
not O
lord O
it O
over O
the O
whole O
family O
. O
Eleanor S-PERSON
would O
of O
course O
quarrel O
first S-ORDINAL
with O
him O
and O
then O
appeal O
to O
her O
father O
, O
who O
without O
hearing O
the O
case O
would O
give O
her O
right O
, O
and O
harshly O
condemn O
Charles S-PERSON
, O
whose O
high O
spirit O
revolted O
| | O
and O
unable O
to O
bear O
with O
his O
father's O
weakness O
of O
character O
, O
as O
he O
ought O
to O
have O
done O
, O
would O
answer O
disrespectfully O
| | O
and O
words O
succeeded O
words O
till O
Charles S-PERSON
in O
a O
desperate O
passion O
would O
seek O
Emmeline's S-PERSON
chamber O
, O
and O
his O
father O
, O
though O
he O
actually O
deeply O
loved O
and O
was O
very O
proud O
of O
his O
son O
, O
wished O
that O
the O
holidays O
were O
over O
, O
and O
Charles S-PERSON
safe O
again O
at O
school O
. O
Trifling O
as O
domestic O
disputes O
may O
seem O
in O
description O
, O
they O
never O
fail O
in O
their O
painful O
reality O
to O
banish O
all O
lasting O
happiness O
. O
Emmeline S-PERSON
could O
bear O
that O
her O
father O
should O
prefer O
Eleanor S-PERSON
to O
herself O
, O
but O
that O
he O
should O
be O
unjust O
to O
her O
darling O
Charles S-PERSON
, O
and O
that O
Charles S-PERSON
should O
increase O
this O
evil O
by O
dispute O
and O
self O
- O
will O
, O
tried O
her O
severely O
, O
and O
obliged O
her O
often O
and O
often O
to O
fly O
to O
the O
solitude O
of O
her O
own O
chamber O
, O
lest O
her O
temper O
also O
should O
fail O
, O
and O
, O
to O
defend O
her O
brother O
, O
she O
should O
forget O
her O
duty O
to O
her O
father O
. O
But O
with O
her O
, O
Mrs. O
Harcourt's S-PERSON
lessons O
had O
indeed O
been O
blessed O
. O
The O
spirit O
of O
true O
, O
heartfelt O
piety O
, O
which O
she O
had O
sought O
to O
instill O
into O
her O
youthful O
charge O
, O
even O
more O
by O
the O
example O
of O
her O
daily O
life O
than O
by O
precepts O
, O
had O
become O
Emmeline's S-PERSON
, O
young O
as O
she O
still O
was O
, O
and O
enabled O
her O
not O
only O
to O
bear O
up O
against O
the O
constant O
petty O
annoyances O
of O
her O
home O
, O
but O
the O
heavy O
trial O
sustained O
in O
the O
death O
of O
Mrs. O
Harcourt S-PERSON
, O
just O
as O
she O
was O
looking O
forward O
to O
her O
entrance O
into O
the O
gay O
world O

under O
her O
maternal O
guardianship O

her O
parting O
with O
her O

who O
, O
not O
two B-DATE
months E-DATE
afterward O
, O
left O
her O
to O
fulfill O
his O
darling O
wish O
of O
going O
to O
sea O
. O
At O
eighteen S-CARDINAL
, O
then O
, O
Emmeline B-PERSON
Manvers E-PERSON
became O
the O
mistress O
of O
her O
father's O
establishment O

and O
had O
to O
encounter O
alone O

not O
only O
the O
suffering O
of O
bereavement O
— O
in O
which O
, O
though O
Lord O
Delmont S-PERSON
sincerely O
respected O
Mrs. O

he O
could O
not O

felt O
so O
very O
greatly O
relieved O

be O
irritated O

angry O
at O
Emmeline's S-PERSON

the O

so O
that O

suspected O

It O

so O
chafed O

pained O
Emmeline's S-PERSON
upright O

Not O
that O
Lord O

a O

appeared O
to O
Emmeline's O

on O

before O

feeling O

respect O

truthful O
child O

his O
heart O

such O
as O
he O
had O
experienced O
toward O
none O
, O
save O
her O
mother O
. O
Emmeline S-PERSON
would O
indeed O
have O
thought O
all O
her O
toils O
repaid O
, O
could O
she O
have O
known O
this O
, O
but O
the O
very O
feeling O
prevented O
the O
display O
of O
that O
caressing O
affection O
he O
still O
lavished O
on O
Eleanor S-PERSON
, O
and O
the O
tears O
of O
his O
elder O
girl O
often O
fell O
thick O
and O
fast O
from O
the O
painful O
longing O
for O
one S-CARDINAL
similar O
caress O
, O
one S-CARDINAL
evidence O
on O
his O
part O
, O
that O
, O
though O
neither O
so O
beautiful O
, O
nor O
talented O
, O
nor O
engaging O
as O
Eleanor S-PERSON
, O
she O
could O
yet O
minister O
to O
his O
comfort O
and O
increase O
his O
happiness O
. O
But O
Emmeline's S-PERSON
strong O
feeling O
of O
religion O
, O
while O
it O
enabled O
her O
to O
bear O
up O
against O
care O
and O
the O
constant O
and O
most O
painful O
feeling O
of O
loneliness O
, O
rendered O
the O
trial O
of O
beholding O
her O
sister's O
willful O
course O
of O
error O
, O
if O
possible O
, O
still O
more O
severe O
. O
She O
knew O
that O
all O
her O
affectionate O
counsels O
were O
worse O
than O
useless O
, O
that O
though O
Eleanor S-PERSON
could O
be O
even O
caressingly O
affectionate O
when O
it O
served O
her O
purpose O
, O
would O
even O
listen O
to O
her O
at O
the O
moment O
of O
suffering O
from O
some O
too O
hasty O
impulse O
, O
she O
had O
no O
lasting O
influence O
. O
And O
this O
became O
more O
and O
more O
evident O
as O
Eleanor S-PERSON
became O
the O
almost O
constant O
companion O
of O
the B-PERSON
Marchioness I-PERSON
Lascelles E-PERSON
, O
their O
only O
female O
relative O
. O
It O
was O
the O
evil O
influence O
of O
this O
lady O
which O
had O
so O
increased O
Eleanor's O
natural O
repugnance O
to O
Mrs. O
Harcourt's S-PERSON
gentle O
sway O
, O
that O
for O
full O
two B-DATE
years E-DATE

death O
the O
flattery O
of O
Lady B-PERSON
Lascelles E-PERSON
and O
Eleanor's S-PERSON
passionate O
entreaties O
had O
prevailed O
on O
Lord O
Delmont S-PERSON
to O
permit O
his O
daughter O
being O
more O
with O
her O
than O
with O
her O
sister O

governess O

Lady B-PERSON
Lascelles E-PERSON
was O
a O
woman O
of O
the O
world O
, O
utterly O
heartless O
, O
highly O
distinguished O

and O
supremely O

At O

various O

which O
the O
lady O

endured O
for O
the O
sake O

Here O
Eleanor S-PERSON

even O
at O
fourteen S-DATE

was O

encouraged O

At O
seventeen S-CARDINAL

introduced O

into O
all O
the O
mysteries O

an O
ultra-fashionable O

very O
speedily O
added O

her O

all O

With O
Lady B-PERSON
Lascelles E-PERSON
for O

it O
was O
not O
very O
surprising O
that O
Emmeline B-PERSON

shrunk O
in O
pain O

dread O

yet O
she O
knew O
her O
social O

too O
well O

refuse O

, O
by O
an O
affectation O

superior O
sanctity O

would O
have O

become O
part O

her O
very O

entered O

the O

the O
coteries O
of O
Lady B-PERSON

her O

was O
indeed O
most O
painful O

aggravated O
by O
the O
constant O

the O
contemplation O

Eleanor's S-PERSON
reckless O
career O
could O
not O

occasion O

But O
Emmeline's S-PERSON
trial O

happily O
not O
of O
very O
long O
duration O

At O
a O

which O
was O
less O

the O

of O
Lady B-PERSON

the O
attention O

a O
young O

by O

Arthur B-PERSON

from O
his O

Emmeline S-PERSON

by O
the O

attached O

His O

so O
distinguished O
himself O
in O
the O
amelioration O
of O
the O
peasantry O

working O

nature O
from O
the O

a O
viscountcy O
was O
offered O
to O

The O
message O
from O
royalty O
reached O
him O
on O
his O
death O

though O
, O
from O
the O
faint O

flickering O
accents O
with O
which O
he O
replied O
to O
the O
intended O
honor O
, O
it O
seemed O
as O
if O
he O
declined O
it O
, O
it O
was O
attributed O
to O
the O
natural O
feelings O
of O
a O
dying O
man O
, O
seeing O
the O
utter O
nothingness O

earthly O
honors O

the O
title O
was O
generously O
proposed O

Arthur B-PERSON

had O
not O
been O
the O
pupil O

father O
in O
vain O
. O
With O
a O
calm O
dignity O
and O
uncompromising O
independence O
, O
he O
declared O
that O
he O
had O
neither O
claim O
nor O
heirship O
to O
the O
reward O
of O
his O
father's O

that O
he O
believed O
his O
parent O
would O
himself O
have O
refused O
it O
, O
preferring O
the O
honorable O
distinction O
of O
being O
an O
untitled O
English S-LANGUAGE
gentleman O
, O
to O
the O
unvalued O
honor O
of O
a O
newly O
- O
created O
lordship O
. O
He O
respectfully O
thanked O
the O
government O
for O
the O
honor O
they O
intended O
, O
but O
decisively O
refused O
it O
— O
that O
his O
dearest O
inheritance O
was O
his O
father's O
name O

Of O
course O
this O
most O
extraordinary O
decision O
was O
canvassed O
again O
and O
again O
in O
the O
fashionable O
world O
, O
meeting O
there O
with O
very O
little O
appreciation O

because O
it O
sprang O
from O
much O
higher O
feelings O
than O
the O
world O
could O
comprehend O
. O
By O
many O
he O
was O
imagined O
very O
little O
removed O
from O
insane O
— O
by O
others O
as O
actuated O
by O
some O
ulterior O
motive O

which O
would O
be O
sure O
to O
display O
itself O
some O
day O
— O
by O
all O
regarded O

some O

with O
earnest O

quiet O

heartfelt O
admiration O

of O

her O

who O
, O
though O
weak O

was O
not O
worldly O

could O
admire O
honorable O
independence O

even O
while O
some O
of O
his O

succeeded O
in O
persuading O
him O
that O
in O
this O
case O
it O
nearly O
reached O
romance O

Arthur B-PERSON
Hamilton E-PERSON
was O
a O
star O

little O
to O
Eleanor B-PERSON

why O

she O
fully O
resolved O

she O
had O
already O

innumerable O

victim O

His O
very O
reserve O
deepened O
her O
ardent O
longing O
, O
and O
the O
difficulty O
only O
strengthened O
her O
resolution O

but O
she O
tried O
in O
vain O

for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
she O
was O
completely O
and O
entirely O
foiled O

and O
she O
disliked O
him O
accordingly O
— O
a O
dislike O
increasing O
to O
actual O
abhorrence O
— O
when O
the O
truth O
at O
length O
forced O
itself O
upon O
her O
, O
that O
he O
admired O
, O
conversed O
with O
, O
evidently O
sought O
the O
society O
of O
her O

all O

Emmeline S-PERSON
bore O
the O
storm O
calmly O
, O
for O
her O
conscience O
perfectly O
acquitted O
her O

She O
was O
not O
indeed O
indifferent O
to O
Arthur B-PERSON

but O
she O
had O
tried O
hard O
to O
prevent O
the O
ascendency O

affection O

the O

her O
happiness O

when O
six B-DATE

related O

her O
the O
heavy O
trial O
of O
his O
early O
life O

and O
concluded O
by O
asking O
her O
if O
she O
could O
indeed O
accept O
a O
heart O
which O
had O
so O
loved O
another O

which O
was O
now O
entirely O
her O

happier O

believed O

The O
very O

with O
courtesy O
, O
and O
the O
quiet O
familiarity O
of O
an O
older O
relative O
— O
and O
more O
, O
actually O
remonstrate O
with O
her O
conduct O
whenever O
he O
thought O
it O
wrong O
. O
It O
was O
the O
recollection O
of O
this O
time O
, O
yet O
more O
than O
actual O
present O
feeling O
, O
which O
had O
occasioned O
the O
mistaken O
impressions O
she O
had O
infused O
into O
both O
her O
children O
, O
of O
the O
extreme O
severity O
and O
harshness O
of O
their O
uncle O
, O
thoughtlessly O
indeed O
, O
for O
the O
present O
was O
always O
all O
to O
her O
, O
and O
if O
she O
did O
think O
that O
they O
might O
one O
day O
be O
under O
his O
charge O
, O
she O
little O
imagined O
the O
unhappiness O
and O
mischief O
which O
their O
supposition O
of O
his O
unbending O
sternness O
might O
engender O
. O
To O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
the O
change O
in O
her O
young O
life O
was O
so O
marvelous O
, O
so O
complete O
— O
care O
, O
anxiety O
, O
loneliness O
, O
that O
sinking O
of O
the O
whole O
frame O
and O
heart O
, O
from O
the O
absence O
of O
appreciation O
and O
social O
kindness O
, O
had O
so O
departed O
, O
leaving O
in O
their O
stead O
such O
an O
intensity O
of O
quiet O
domestic O
happiness O
, O
that O
it O
was O
long O
before O
her O
full O
heart O
could O
believe O
it O
reality O
, O
and O
rest O
secure O
. O
She O
had O
always O
longed O
for O
one O
to O
reverence O
, O
to O
cling O
to O
, O
and O
her O
husband O
gave O
her O
room O
for O
both O
. O
As O
his O
betrothed O
, O
even O
before O
their O
marriage O
, O
she O
had O
been O
introduced O
to O
very O
different O
society O
to O
that O
of O
the O
marchioness O
| | O
she O
beheld O
him O
reverenced O
, O
loved O
, O
appealed O
to O
by O
the O
wisest O
and O
the O
best O
men O
, O
often O
older O
than O
himself O
. O
That O
this O
man O
should O
so O
love O
, O
cherish O
, O
and O
actually O
reverence O
her O
— O
no O
wonder O
that O
under O
the O
magic O
of O
such O
feelings O
her O
character O
matured O
, O
displaying O
such O
engaging O
and O
unsuspected O
qualities O
, O
that O
even O
her O
husband O
often O
looked O
at O
her O
with O
astonishment O
, O
playfully O
asking O
her O
if O
she O
could O
be O
the O
same O
calm O
, O
almost O
too O
quiet O
, O
and O
seemingly O
too O
cold O
Emmeline B-PERSON
Manvers E-PERSON
whom O
he O
had O
first S-ORDINAL
seen O
. O
Her O
very O
talents O
, O
which O
had O
seemed O
worthless O
, O
compared O
to O
her O
sister's O
, O
were O
called O
forth O
by O
her O
husband O
. O
She O
found O
that O
her O
voice O
and O
her O
touch O
on O
either O
piano O
or O
harp O
, O
could O
give O
him O
exquisite O
pleasure O
, O
and O
this O
once O
discovered O
, O
she O
made O
such O
improvement O
as O
almost O
to O
surprise O
herself O
. O
She O
found O
the O
sketches O
taken O
from O
the O
various O
lovely O
spots O
in O
the O
vicinity O
of O
their O
noble O
seat O
, O
and O
in O
which O
Devonshire S-GPE
abounds O
, O
delighted O
him O
, O
and O
when O
Eleanor S-PERSON
did O
visit O
Oakwood S-GPE
, O
she O
was O
astounded O
at O
the O
various O
beautiful O
drawings O
, O
which O
evinced O
the O
employment O
of O
that O
leisure O
which O
she O
had O
declared O
must O
be O
even O
to O
the O
quiet O
Emmeline S-PERSON
a O
horrid O
bore O
. O
To O
Lord O
Delmont S-PERSON
the O
change O
in O
his O
daughter O
was O
much O
more O
astonishing O
than O
to O
her O
husband O
. O
He O
was O
very O
often O
at O
Oakwood S-GPE
( O
particularly O
when O
a O
little O
grandson O
was O
added O
to O
the O
happy O
party O
) O
, O
for O
his O
home O
under O
Eleanor's S-PERSON
extravagant O
and O
heedless O
management O
had O
lost O
all O
the O
comfort O
that O
Emmeline S-PERSON
had O
bestowed O
. O
He O
had O
begun O
, O
too O
, O
to O
discover O
that O
his O
darling O
, O
his O
still O
favorite O
Eleanor S-PERSON
, O
was O
not O
faultless O
. O
Emmeline's S-PERSON
generous O
assistance O
and O
determination O
to O
spare O
her O
father O
all O
discomfort O
had O
concealed O
Eleanor's S-PERSON
personal O
extravagance O
from O
him O
| | O
but O
after O
her O
marriage O
, O
as O
Eleanor's S-PERSON
fashionable O
amusements O
increased O
, O
so O
did O
the O
quantity O
and O
amount O
of O
her O
bills O
, O
which O
, O
as O
the O
young O
lady O
did O
not O
seem O
inclined O
to O
settle O
them O
, O
were O
sent O
to O
her O
father O
. O
Lord O
Delmont S-PERSON
was O
painfully O
startled O
, O
and O
with O
his O
usual O
want O
of O
judgment O
spoke O
to O
Eleanor S-PERSON
at O
the O
very O
moment O
that O
he O
felt O
most O
angry O
| | O
unaccustomed O
to O
reproof O
from O
him O
, O
she O
retorted O
with O
equal O
passion O
, O
and O
a O
violent O
altercation O
ensued O
, O
which O
ended O
in O
Eleanor S-PERSON
ordering O
the O
carriage O
and O
driving O
to O
Lady B-PERSON
Lascelles E-PERSON
, O
declaring O
she O
could O
not O
think O
of O
returning O
home O
, O
till O
her O
father O
had O
sufficiently O
recovered O
his O
senses O
for O
her O
to O
do O
so O
in O
safety O
. O
The O
interference O
of O
Emmeline S-PERSON
at O
length O
succeeded O
in O
restoring O
peace O
, O
but O
Lord O
Delmont's S-PERSON
eyes O
had O
been O
rudely O
opened O
, O
and O
, O
as O
is O
unhappily O
too O
often O
the O
case O
with O
those O
weak O
characters O
where O
over O
- O
indulgence O
of O
childhood O
, O
has O
occasioned O
those O
annoyances O
of O
ungoverned O
youth O
, O
he O
became O
irritable O
and O
sometimes O
even O
harsh O
with O
Eleanor S-PERSON
, O
which O
conduct O
threw O
her O
still O
more O
with O
Lady B-PERSON
Lascelles E-PERSON
. O
As O
to O
joining O
society O
with O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
when O
they O
were O
in O
London S-GPE
, O
Eleanor S-PERSON
would O
not O
hear O
of O
it O
. O
But O
to O
her O
sister's O
great O
joy O
, O
and O
some O
surprise O
, O
she O
accepted O
an O
invitation O
to O
Oakwood S-GPE
a O
short O
time O
after O
little O
Percy's S-PERSON
birth O
| | O
and O
, O
still O
more O
surprising O
, O
condescended O
to O
make O
herself O
agreeable O
. O
The O
London S-GPE
season O
had O
tired O
her O
, O
and O
she O
thought O
she O
might O
just O
as O
well O
be O
dull O
on O
the O
banks O
of O
the O
Dart S-PRODUCT
in O
August S-DATE
and O
September S-DATE
as O
in O
some O
stupid O
watering O
- O
place O
. O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
despite O
her O
dislike O
, O
which O
she O
cared O
not O
to O
avow O
, O
she O
found O
could O
be O
at O
least O
very O
entertaining O
| | O
her O
father O
was O
more O
like O
his O
former O
self O
, O
her O
sister O
far O
more O
delightful O
and O
lovely O
than O
she O
ever O
thought O
she O
could O
be O
, O
and O
her O
nephew O
certainly O
a O
pretty O
little O
plague O
. O
Then O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
had O
a O
beautiful O
horse O
entirely O
for O
her O
use O
, O
and O
she O
rode O
exceedingly O
well O
, O
and O
was O
greatly O
admired O
. O
She O
was O
seized O
with O
an O
exploring O
mania O
, O
and O
dragged O
Emmeline S-PERSON
to O
every O
old O
ruin O
and O
dark O
wood O
within O
ten B-QUANTITY
miles E-QUANTITY
of O
Oakwood S-GPE
. O
Altogether O
the O
impression O
she O
left O
behind O
her O
, O
after O
a O
two B-DATE
months' E-DATE
visit O
, O
was O
such O
as O
to O
ease O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
great O
anxiety O
, O
more O
especially O
as O
it O
appeared O
from O
certain O
private O
conversations O
, O
that O
her O
affections O
were O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
really O
engaged O
, O
and O
Emmeline S-PERSON
had O
always O
fondly O
hoped O
that O
when O
that O
should O
be O
the O
case O
, O
Eleanor S-PERSON
would O
become O
a O
very O
different O
person O
. O
Alas O
! O
penetrative O
as O
she O
was O
, O
she O
had O
not O
yet O
learned O
her O
sister's O
character O
| | O
simply O
because O
utter O
heartlessness O
in O
any O
woman O
she O
could O
not O
comprehend O
. O
Her O
visit O
to O
her O
father O
in O
London S-GPE
, O
in O
the O
winter O
, O
removed O
all O
their O
rising O
hopes O
, O
and O
caused O
such O
increased O
and O
intense O
anxiety O
, O
as O
so O
to O
injure O
her O
already O
delicate O
health O
that O
her O
husband O
bore O
her O
back O
to O
Oakwood S-GPE
a O
full O
month O
before O
they O
had O
originally O
intended O
. O
Whether O
or O
not O
Eleanor S-PERSON
loved O
Lord O
Fitzclair S-PERSON
, O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
determine O
| | O
but O
that O
he O
devotedly O
, O
passionately O
loved O
her O
, O
was O
only O
too O
evident O
, O
not O
only O
to O
the O
world O
, O
but O
to O
herself O
| | O
and O
this O
once O
confirmed O
, O
she O
left O
no O
method O
untried O
to O
torment O
, O
and O
so O
, O
as O
she O
declared O
, O
to O
try O
if O
his O
affections O
were O
worth O
having O
. O
He O
was O
half S-CARDINAL
an O
Italian S-NORP
, O
and O
had O
inherited O
all O
the O
strong O
, O
fierce O
passions O
of O
that O
country O
, O
without O
one S-CARDINAL
atom O
of O
self O
- O
control O
. O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
knew O
him O
well O
, O
far O
better O
than O
he O
knew O
himself O
, O
and O
conjured O
him O
to O
withdraw O
from O
the O
society O
of O
one O
who O
could O
never O
make O
him O
happy O
, O
and O
whose O
capricious O
conduct O
was O
so O
likely O
to O
render O
him O
desperate O
and O
miserable O
: O
he O
reasoned O
, O
entreated O
in O
vain O
. O
" O
She O
only O
wants O
to O
try O
the O
strength O
of O
my O
love O
, O
" O
was O
his O
sole O
reply O
| | O
" O
and O
were O
she O
to O
torment O
health O
and O
life O
away O
, O
it O
will O
never O
change O
— O
she O
will O
be O
mine O
yet O
. O
" O
And O
to O
the O
astonishment O
of O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
two B-DATE
months E-DATE
afterward O
he O
proposed O
in O
form O
, O
and O
actually O
was O
accepted O
, O
with O
the O
sole O
condition O
that O
their O
engagement O
should O
be O
kept O
secret O
till O
it O
should O
please O
Eleanor S-PERSON
to O
name O
the O
wedding O
day O
, O
which O
could O
not O
be O
at O
least O
for O
six B-DATE
or I-DATE
eight I-DATE
months E-DATE
. O
This O
engagement O
might O
have O
eased O
anxiety O
, O
but O
the O
condition O
increased O
it O
, O
especially O
, O
as O
instead O
of O
coming O
to O
Oakwood S-GPE
, O
as O
Emmeline S-PERSON
had O
asked O
and O
hoped O
, O
the O
latter O
part O
of O
the O
summer O
and O
autumn O
was O
to O
be O
spent O
in O
Cheltenham S-GPE
with O
a O
very O
gay O
party O
, O
in O
which O
Eleanor S-PERSON
was O
still O
of O
course O
the O
star O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
entered O
the O
nursery O
one B-TIME
morning E-TIME
earlier O
than O
usual O
, O
for O
her O
infant O
had O
not O
been O
well O
the O
night O
before O
, O
and O
she O
had O
already O
experienced O
the O
care O
as O
well O
as O
the O
joy O
of O
a O
mother O
. O
Her O
babe O
was O
better O
, O
and O
as O
he O
lay O
smilingly O
and O
happily O
in O
her O
lap O
, O
and O
watched O
the O
eager O
movements O
of O
his O
brother O
, O
she O
was O
only O
sensible O
of O
pleasure O
. O
The O
nurse O
had O
arranged O
the O
chairs O
in O
a O
long O
line O
, O
that O
Master O
Percy S-PERSON
might O
, O
with O
their O
help O
, O
walk O
the O
whole O
length O
of O
the O
large O
and O
airy O
room O
. O
The O
feat O
mightily O
pleased O
the O
little O
gentleman O
, O
who O
, O
having O
acquired O
the O
venerable O
age O
of O
fifteen B-DATE
months E-DATE
, O
liked O
better O
to O
feel O
his O
feet O
than O
crawl O
on O
the O
floor O
, O
or O
be O
carried O
about O
on O
any O
limbs O
but O
his O
own O
. O
Every O
two S-CARDINAL
or O
three S-CARDINAL
paces O
he O
stood O
nearly O
alone O
, O
and O
burst O
into O
a O
loud O
merry O
laugh O
, O
which O
was O
always O
echoed O
by O
a O
crow O
of O
joy O
from O
his O
little O
brother O
. O
" O
Take O
care O
, O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
love O
, O
don't O
fall O
and O
frighten O
mamma O
, O
" O
said O
his O
young O
mother O
, O
who O
was O
watching O
him O
with O
such O
pleasure O
as O
to O
send O
for O
his O
father O
to O
share O
it O
. O
When O
her O
son O
, O
to O
prove O
how O
well O
he O
obeyed O
her O
commands O
to O
take O
care O
, O
stood O
for O
a O
second S-ORDINAL
without O
any O
support O
, O
and O
then O
ran O
quite O
alone O
across O
the O
room O
, O
and O
with O
a O
yet O
louder O
laugh O
hid O
his O
rosy O
face O
in O
her O
lap O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
fondly O
kissed O
the O
little O
nestling O
head O
, O
and O
at O
that O
moment O
her O
husband O
entered O
the O
room O
. O
" O
Dearest O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
" O
she O
eagerly O
exclaimed O
, O
" O
I O
was O
actually O
foolish O
enough O
to O
send O
for O
you O
. O
Herbert S-PERSON
seems O
quite O
well O
| | O
I O
was O
, O
it O
seems O
, O
needlessly O
alarmed O
, O
and O
Percy S-PERSON
has O
this O
moment O
— O
" O
She O
stopped O
in O
sudden O
terror O
, O
for O
there O
was O
an O
expression O
on O
her O
husband's O
countenance O
of O
such O
unusual O
agitation O
, O
that O
though O
he O
tried O
to O
smile O
when O
he O
heard O
her O
words O
, O
she O
could O
not O
conquer O
her O
alarm O
, O
more O
than O
to O
say O
, O
in O
a O
caressing O
voice O
to O
her O
little O
boy O
— O
" O
Will O
not O
Percy S-PERSON
run O
to O
papa O
, O
and O
ask O
him O
why O
he O
looks O
so O
sad O
? O
" O
The O
child O
looked O
up O
in O
her O
face O
, O
and O
then O
, O
as O
his O
father O
held O
out O
his O
arms O
to O
him O
, O
let O
go O
his O
mother's O
dress O
, O
and O
obeyed O
her O
. O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
caught O
him O
to O
his O
heart O
, O
held O
him O
for O
above B-TIME
a I-TIME
minute E-TIME
, O
kissed O
him O
fondly O
, O
and O
left O
the O
nursery O
without O
uttering O
a O
single O
word O
. O
" O
Let O
me O
take O
Master O
Herbert S-PERSON
, O
ma'am O
, O
" O
said O
the O
head O
nurse O
respectfully O
, O
for O
she O
saw O
that O
her O
mistress's O
unexpressed O
alarm O
had O
nearly O
overpowered O
her O
| | O
and O
in O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes E-TIME
Emmeline S-PERSON
was O
with O
her O
husband O
, O
whose O
agitation O
was O
so O
excessive O
, O
that O
even O
his O
wife's O
presence O
, O
for O
the O
moment O
, O
had O
scarcely O
power O
to O
calm O
him O
. O
The O
tale O
was O
soon O
told O
. O
Eleanor's S-PERSON
conduct O
since O
her O
engagement O
had O
been O
such O
as O
to O
excite O
the O
displeasure O
, O
not O
of O
her O
father O
alone O
, O
but O
actually O
of O
the O
marchioness O
| | O
who O
, O
though O
a O
weak O
and O
worldly O
woman O
, O
had O
yet O
some O
idea O
of O
propriety O
. O
As O
a O
near O
relation O
of O
Lord O
Delmont S-PERSON
, O
Eleanor's S-PERSON
engagement O
with O
Lord O
Fitzclair S-PERSON
was O
of O
course O
told O
to O
her O
, O
and O
again O
and O
again O
she O
warned O
her O
that O
she O
was O
going O
too O
far O
, O
and O
might O
lose O
her O
lover O
before O
she O
was O
aware O
of O
it O
| | O
but O
Eleanor S-PERSON
only O
laughed O
at O
her O
, O
and O
at O
last O
won O
her O
over O
to O
the O
belief O
that O
it O
was O
certainly O
better O
to O
cure O
Fitzclair S-PERSON
of O
his O
jealous O
tendency O
before O
marriage O
than O
afterward O
. O
Lord O
Delmont's S-PERSON
reproofs O
she O
was O
wont O
to O
silence O
, O
by O
invariably O
making O
them O
the O
signal O
of O
mortifying O
and O
annoying O
Lord O
Fitzclair S-PERSON
still O
more O
than O
usual O
. O
Yet O
still O
at O
times O
she O
relented O
, O
and O
so O
strengthened O
the O
love O
she O
had O
excited O
, O
so O
enhanced O
her O
own O
fascinations O
, O
that O
all O
the O
agony O
he O
had O
endured O
and O
was O
still O
, O
he O
knew O
, O
to O
endure O
, O
by O
an O
incomprehensible O
contradiction O
, O
riveted O
her O
power O
and O
hastened O
his O
own O
doom O
. O
Weak O
in O
all O
things O
but O
his O
love O
, O
he O
could O
not O
demand O
as O
his O
actual O
right O
the O
publication O
of O
their O
engagement O
. O
Eleanor S-PERSON
vowed O
if O
he O
did O
till O
she O
permitted O
him O
, O
she O
would O
have O
nothing O
more O
to O
say O
to O
him O
. O
She O
knew O
, O
though O
she O
did O
not O
say O
it O
, O
that O
once O
made O
known O
, O
a O
chain O
would O
be O
thrown O
round O
her O
actions O
, O
which O
she O
did O
not O
choose O
to O
endure O
. O
And O
father O
, O
lover O
, O
and O
friend O
, O
all O
feeling O
she O
was O
wrong O
, O
and O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
and O
last O
repeatedly O
telling O
her O
so O
, O
had O
yet O
neither O
of O
them O
the O
resolution O
to O
contend O
with O
her O
, O
and O
compel O
the O
proper O
course O
. O
A O
month O
of O
their O
visit O
to O
Cheltenham S-GPE
so O
passed O
, O
when O
Eleanor's S-PERSON
attention O
was O
arrested O
by O
a O
new O
actor O
on O
the O
scene O
. O
She O
had O
begun O
to O
tire O
of O
her O
present O
satellites O
, O
and O
a O
young O
military O
captain O
, O
whose O
furlough O
from O
India S-GPE
had O
just O
expired O
, O
and O
whose O
pale O
face O
, O
somewhat O
melancholy O
expression O
, O
and O
very O
elegant O
figure O
, O
presented O
a O
new O
subject O
for O
conquest O
impossible O
to O
be O
resisted O
| | O
and O
it O
was O
unhappily O
, O
only O
too O
easily O
achieved O
. O
She O
made O
no O
secret O
of O
her O
admiration O
, O
speaking O
of O
him O
in O
such O
terms O
to O
her O
intended O
husband O
as O
to O
excite O
anew O
every O
jealous O
feeling O
. O
It O
was O
easy O
for O
Captain O
Fortescue S-PERSON
to O
discover O
Fitzclair S-PERSON
was O
his O
rival O
| | O
but O
believing O
himself O
decidedly O
the O
object O
of O
Eleanor's S-PERSON
preference O
, O
he O
increased O
his O
attentions O
, O
little O
imagining O
the O
storm O
he O
was O
exciting O
, O
the O
more O
fearful O
from O
its O
determined O
suppression O
. O
Lord O
Delmont S-PERSON
interfered O
several O
times O
, O
not O
only O
by O
reproaches O
to O
Eleanor S-PERSON
, O
but O
by O
determined O
coldness O
to O
her O
new O
suitor O
. O
Finding O
at O
length O
that O
her O
encouragement O
actually O
neared O
a O
criminal O
extent O
, O
and O
after O
a O
desperately O
stormy O
interview O
, O
he O
solemnly O
declared O
that O
if O
she O
did O
not O
dismiss O
Captain B-PERSON
Fortescue E-PERSON
at O
once O
, O
he O
would O
shame O
her O
in O
the O
face O
of O
the O
whole O
world O
, O
by O
proclaiming O
her O
engagement O
with O
the O
young O
marquis O
. O
Eleanor S-PERSON
in O
equal O
anger O
, O
declared O
that O
if O
he O
threatened O
, O
so O
too O
could O
she O
| | O
and O
if O
he O
tormented O
her O
any O
more O
she O
would O
prevent O
all O
publication O
of O
her O
engagement O
, O
by O
herself O
snapping O
it O
asunder O
, O
and O
pledging O
her O
faith O
to O
Captain O
Fortescue S-PERSON
. O
This O
was O
too O
much O
even O
for O
Lord O
Delmont S-PERSON
. O
Declaring O
if O
she O
did O
so O
, O
a O
father's O
heaviest O
malediction O
should O
fall O
on O
her O
head O
, O
he O
hastily O
left O
her O
| | O
and O
Eleanor S-PERSON
very O
composedly O
went O
to O
prepare O
for O
an O
excursion O
on O
horseback O
with O
Fortescue S-PERSON
, O
Fitzclair S-PERSON
and O
others O
. O
When O
Lord O
Delmont's S-PERSON
passions O
were O
once O
roused O
, O
even O
his O
ordinarily O
slender O
judgment O
entirely O
forsook O
him O
, O
and O
he O
did O
that O
which O
at O
another O
time O
, O
knowing O
Fitzclair S-PERSON
as O
he O
did O
, O
he O
would O
have O
shrunk O
from O
. O
He O
sought O
him O
, O
while O
still O
exasperated O
, O
upbraided O
him O
for O
his O
weakness O
in O
permitting O
Eleanor's S-PERSON
unprincipled O
conduct O
, O
and O
warned O
him O
that O
, O
if O
he O
did O
not O
adopt O
some O
strong O
measures O
to O
prevent O
it O
, O
he O
would O
certainly O
lose O
her O
entirely O
. O
The O
young O
man O
heard O
him O
without O
reply O
| | O
but O
his O
face O
grew O
livid O
, O
and O
he O
clenched O
his O
hand O
till O
the O
blood O
started O
from O
the O
nails O
, O
and O
in O
this O
mood O
of O
concentrated O
passion O
joined O
the O
riding O
party O
. O
The O
exercise O
itself O
is O
, O
to O
some O
temperaments O
, O
unusually O
exciting O
, O
and O
the O
determined O
coldness O
of O
Eleanor S-PERSON
to O
himself O
, O
and O
the O
eagerly O
- O
received O
devotion O
of O
Fortescue S-PERSON
, O
maddened O
him O
. O
He O
demanded O
an O
interview O
with O
her O
on O
their O
return O
home O
, O
struggled O
to O
speak O
calmly O
, O
expostulated O
, O
and O
, O
finally O
, O
reproached O
. O
Eleanor S-PERSON
, O
already O
irritated O
| | O
and O
, O
beyond O
all O
, O
that O
her O
lover O
, O
in O
general O
so O
obsequious O
and O
humble O
, O
should O
dare O
to O
call O
her O
to O
account O
for O
mere O
amusement O
, O
combined O
with O
the O
recollection O
of O
Captain O
Fortescue's S-PERSON
flattering O
vows O
and O
willing O
homage O
, O
excited O
her O
to O
an O
extent O
of O
which O
she O
was O
herself O
unconscious O
, O
inasmuch O
as O
she O
firmly O
believed O
, O
whatever O
she O
might O
say O
then O
, O
a O
few O
soft O
words O
would O
speedily O
obliterate O
. O
She O
told O
him O
that O
really O
his O
jealous O
temperament O
was O
beyond O
all O
endurance O
| | O
that O
he O
certainly O
must O
intend O
her O
to O
despise O
and O
abhor O
him O
| | O
and O
that O
the O
contrast O
he O
presented O
to O
Captain O
Fortescue S-PERSON
was O
such O
as O
to O
make O
her O
most O
heartily O
wish O
to O
put O
an O
end O
to O
their O
engagement O
, O
as O
she O
felt O
quite O
sure O
it O
must O
only O
end O
in O
misery O
for O
both O
| | O
and O
, O
without O
waiting O
for O
a O
reply O
, O
she O
haughtily O
brushed O
by O
him O
, O
and O
disappeared O
. O
Of O
the O
extent O
of O
Fitzclair's S-PERSON
passion O
Eleanor S-PERSON
had O
not O
the O
least O
idea O
, O
and O
this O
is O
saying O
a O
great O
deal O
, O
for O
she O
generally O
exaggerated O
her O
own O
power O
. O
She O
believed O
she O
had O
inflicted O
pain O
, O
but O
not O
as O
much O
as O
he O
deserved O
| | O
and O
determined O
that O
she O
would O
torment O
him O
yet O
more O
at O
the O
ball O
that O
evening O
. O
But O
to O
her O
extreme O
mortification O
, O
he O
did O
not O
appear O
, O
and O
there O
was O
a O
vague O
dread O
on O
her O
spirits O
as O
she O
retired O
for O
the O
night O
, O
which O
prevented O
any O
thing O
like O
rest O
. O
His O
absence O
had O
excited O
surprise O
in O
all O
, O
especially O
Lady B-PERSON
Lascelles E-PERSON
, O
who O
knew O
that O
to O
leave O
Eleanor S-PERSON
entirely O
to O
the O
attentions O
of O
young O
Fortescue S-PERSON
was O
so O
unprecedented O
as O
to O
bode O
no O
good O
. O
But O
the O
wildest O
conjectures O
were O
far O
from O
reality O
. O
The O
very O
next O
morning O
all O
Cheltenham S-GPE
was O
thrown O
into O
the O
most O
painful O
excitement O
by O
the O
incomprehensible O
and O
most O
extraordinary O
fact O
of O
the O
suicide O
of O
Lord O
Fitzclair S-PERSON
| | O
by O
what O
occasioned O
, O
plunged O
into O
such O
mystery O
that O
nothing O
but O
sudden O
aberration O
of O
mind O
was O
imagined O
, O
a O
belief O
justified O
by O
the O
very O
peculiar O
temperament O
and O
manners O
of O
the O
young O
nobleman O
during O
his O
sojourn O
with O
them O
. O
His O
will O
, O
a O
valuable O
present O
, O
with O
a O
few O
lines O
of O
regard O
to O
his O
faithful O
attendant O
, O
and O
a O
letter O
addressed O
to O
Arthur B-PERSON
Hamilton E-PERSON
, O
Esq. O
, O
were O
the O
sole O
evidences O
that O
the O
awful O
deed O
had O
not O
been O
committed O
without O
some O
preparation O

but O
as O
that O
was O
often O
the O
case O
with O
madness O
itself O
, O
it O
excited O
no O
remark O

The O
state O
of O
Eleanor's S-GPE
mind O
when O
these O
awful O
tidings O
were O
communicated O

her O

they O
were O
by O

father O

agitation O

anger O

To O
believe O
that O
she O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
his O
miserable O
end O
was O
an O
attempt O
so O
vain O

hollow O

that O
even O
she O
shrunk O
from O
the O
hopeless O

realize O
it O

remorse O
in O
all O
its O
torturing O
, O
unmitigated O
anguish O
took O
possession O
of O
her O
, O

instead O
of O
leading O
her O
to O
penitence O
, O
and O
thence O
the O
hope O
of O
peace O
, O
it O
urged O
her O
to O
a O
course O
of O
action O
from O
which O
she O
imagined O
there O
was O
no O
withdrawing O

which O
must O
in O
time O

by O
removing O

from O
all O

lessen O
her O
present O
misery O

For O
three B-DATE
days E-DATE
and O
nights O
she O
never O
quitted O
her O
own O
apartment O
, O
and O
then O
joined O
her O
usual O
circles O
without O
the O
smallest O
evidence O
of O
the O
internal O
agony O
which O
was O
still O
hers O
. O
It O
was O
very O
easy O
to O
displace O
paleness O
by O
artificial O
roses O
, O
and O
her O
gay O
smiles O
and O
joyous O
sallies O
were O
tempered O
only O
by O
a O
judiciously O
- O
expressed O
horror O
when O
the O
late O
event O
was O
discussed O
before O
her O
, O
supposed O
natural O
to O
one O
who O
had O
known O
him O
so O
intimately O

but O
the O
hours O
of O
loneliness O
which O
followed O
this O
conduct O
in O
society O
were O
terrible O
indeed O
. O
By O
a O
strange O
contrariety O
of O
feeling O
, O
her O
better O
nature O
longed O
for O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
and O
her O
artificial O
, O
which O
had O
, O
alas O
! O
only O
too O
forcibly O
become O
her O
natural O
self O
, O
felt O
as O
if O
she O
would O
leave O
the O
kingdom O
rather O
than O
encounter O
the O
mild O
, O
sorrowful O
glance O
of O
those O
penetrating O
eyes O
. O
Lord O
Delmont S-PERSON
was O
himself O
in O
a O
most O
pitiable O
condition O
| | O
even O
minor O
evils O
had O
always O
been O
great O
to O
him O
, O
and O
the O
effect O
of O
this O
, O
the O
wish O
to O
take O
Eleanor S-PERSON
away O
from O
Captain O
Fortescue's S-PERSON
increased O
and O
annoying O
attentions O
, O
and O
yet O
the O
dread O
that O
doing O
so O
would O
connect O
her O
with O
Fitzclair's S-PERSON
death O
, O
so O
distracted O
him O
as O
to O
render O
him O
really O
ill O
— O
information O
which O
instantly O
brought O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
to O
Cheltenham S-GPE
. O
Some O
young O
wives O
and O
mothers O
might O
have O
felt O
it O
hard O
that O
their O
domestic O
enjoyment O
should O
so O
continually O
have O
been O
disturbed O
and O
annoyed O
from O
the O
faults O
of O
others O
| | O
but O
Emmeline S-PERSON
had O
been O
accustomed O
to O
trace O
every O
thing O
that O
created O
personal O
suffering O
to O
the O
highest O
source O
, O
and O
feel O
that O
it O
was O
good O
for O
her O
, O
or O
it O
would O
not O
be O
| | O
a O
conviction O
that O
enabled O
her O
to O
bear O
with O
and O
still O
to O
love O
the O
erring O
one O
that O
was O
the O
visible O
cause O
of O
pain O
. O
Eleanor S-PERSON
was O
at O
a O
gay O
ball O
the O
night O
of O
her O
arrival O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
requested O
she O
might O
not O
be O
informed O
of O
it O
till O
the B-DATE
following I-DATE
day E-DATE
. O
About B-TIME
half I-TIME
an I-TIME
hour E-TIME
before O
her B-TIME
usual I-TIME
hour E-TIME
of O
rising O
after O
such O
scenes O
, O
she O
entered O
her O
sister's O
room O
. O
All O
around O
her O
lay O
the O
ornaments O
of O
the O
previous O
evening O
, O
looking O
so O
strange O
, O
gaudy O
, O
and O
faded O
in O
the O
darkened O
room O
, O
and O
judged O
by O
the O
calmer O
feelings O
of O
the O
morning O
. O
A O
sensation O
of O
intense O
depression O
crept O
over O
Emmeline S-PERSON
as O
she O
gazed O
, O
increasing O
as O
she O
looked O
on O
the O
face O
of O
the O
sleeper O
, O
which O
, O
divested O
of O
its O
unnatural O
bloom O
, O
looked O
so O
fearfully O
wan O
and O
haggard O
. O
Her O
beautiful O
hair O
lay O
in O
tangled O
masses O
on O
her O
damp O
brow O
, O
and O
as O
Emmeline S-PERSON
gently O
tried O
to O
remove O
it O
, O
Eleanor S-PERSON
started O
and O
awoke O
. O
" O
Is O
it O
already O
time O
to O
get O
up O
? O
" O
she O
said O
languidly O
, O
and O
only O
half O
unclosing O
her O
eyes O
| | O
" O
I O
feel O
as O
if O
I O
had O
not O
slept O
at O
all O
. O
Am O
I O
dreaming O
? O
" O
she O
added O
, O
starting O
up O
, O
" O
or O
have O
I O
slept O
in O
one S-CARDINAL
place O
, O
and O
awoke O
in O
another O
? O
Am O
I O
at O
Oakwood S-GPE
? O
" O
" O
No O
, O
dearest O
Eleanor S-PERSON
| | O
will O
you O
not O
welcome O
me O
to O
Malvern B-FAC
House E-FAC
? O
" O
The O
voice O
, O
the O
look O
, O
seemed O
to O
thrill O
through O
her O
| | O
her O
temples O
were O
throbbing O
, O
her O
heart O
weighed O
down O
, O
as O
it O
always O
was O
when O
she O
first S-ORDINAL
awoke O
, O
with O
an O
undefinable O
sense O
of O
guilt O
and O
pain O
| | O
she O
tried O
to O
be O
cold O
, O
proud O
, O
reserved O
, O
but O
it O
would O
not O
do O
, O
and O
she O
suddenly O
flung O
her O
arms O
round O
her O
sister's O
neck O
, O
and O
burst O
into O
agonized O
tears O
. O
It O
was O
a O
most O
unexpected O
greeting O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
argued O
hopefully O
from O
it O
. O
Alas O
! O
the O
unwonted O
softening O
only O
lasted O
one B-TIME
brief I-TIME
half I-TIME
hour E-TIME
. O
She O
left O
her O
at O
Eleanor's S-GPE
entreaty O
while O
dressing O
, O
and O
when O
she O
returned O
, O
though O
the O
reckless O
girl O
told O
her O
with O
a O
half O
smile O
that O
she O
was O
ready O
for O
her O
lecture O
, O
for O
she O
could O
only O
have O
come O
from O
Oakwood S-GPE
to O
give O
her O
one O
| | O
and O
that O
however O
severe O
her O
words O
might O
be O
, O
she O
could O
not O
alter O
her O
tone O
, O
that O
must O
be O
kind O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
herself O
. O
Yet O
Emmeline S-PERSON
could O
not O
succeed O
in O
convincing O
her O
how O
wrongly O
, O
how O
cruelly O
she O
had O
acted O
. O
Eleanor S-PERSON
would O
persist O
that O
she O
was O
not O
in O
the O
least O
to O
blame O
, O
and O
that O
poor O
Fitzclair's S-PERSON
fearful O
end O
was O
only O
owing O
to O
his O
own O
violent O
passions O
| | O
in O
fact O
, O
that O
he O
must O
have O
been O
out O
of O
his O
mind O
, O
and O
that O
, O
though O
it O
was O
certainly O
very O
dreadful O
, O
she O
had O
perhaps O
escaped O
a O
very O
terrible O
doom O
| | O
but O
speak O
as O
she O
might O
, O
Emmeline S-PERSON
was O
not O
deceived O
as O
to O
the O
agony O
she O
was O
actually O
enduring O
. O
Finding O
, O
however O
, O
that O
all O
her O
gentle O
efforts O
were O
useless O
, O
that O
even O
the O
perusal O
of O
Fitzclair's S-PERSON
brief O
lines O
to O
her O
husband O
— O
which O
Eleanor S-PERSON
insisted O
on O
seeing O
, O
and O
in O
which O
he O
deplored O
his O
madness O
in O
not O
having O
followed O
his O
advice O
, O
and O
flown O
from O
her O
presence O
, O
and O
bade O
him O
take O
his O
forgiveness O
to O
her O
, O
and O
say O
, O
that O
the O
means O
he O
had O
adopted O
would O
, O
he O
trusted O
, O
dissolve O
their O
engagement O
to O
her O
satisfaction O
— O
had O
no O
effect O
, O
save O
in O
causing O
her O
to O
turn O
so O
deadly O
pale O
, O
that O
her O
sister O
was O
convinced O
nothing O
but O
an O
almost O
supernatural O
effort O
of O
pride O
preserved O
her O
from O
fainting O
. O
She O
desisted O
| | O
hoping O
against O
hope O
that O
Eleanor S-PERSON
would O
yet O
repent O
and O
become O
a O
different O
being O
. O
She O
knew O
harshness O
would O
only O
harden O
, O
and O
so O
she O
tried O
to O
prevail O
on O
her O
father O
to O
treat O
her O
as O
usual O
, O
but O
this O
Lord O
Delmont S-PERSON
could O
not O
do O
. O
It O
is O
strange O
how O
often O
we O
find O
those O
parents O
who O
have O
been O
over O
- O
indulgent O
to O
childhood O
, O
unusually O
harsh O
to O
the O
faults O
of O
youth O
. O
Weak O
characters O
, O
also O
, O
when O
driven O
to O
anger O
, O
are O
always O
more O
violent O
than O
firmer O
ones O
| | O
and O
, O
certainly O
, O
Eleanor's S-PERSON
continued O
haughtiness O
and O
coldness O
, O
as O
if O
she O
were O
the O
injured O
one O
, O
did O
not O
tend O
to O
calm O
him O
. O
And O
his O
angry O
feelings O
were O
unfortunately O
but O
too O
soon O
aggravated O
by O
a O
proposal O
in O
form O
from O
Captain O
Fortescue S-PERSON
for O
the O
hand O
of O
Eleanor S-PERSON
. O
Without O
a O
moment's O
delay O
he O
dispatched O
a O
decided O
and O
almost O
insulting O
refusal O
to O
the O
young O
soldier O
, O
and O
then O
sought O
his O
daughter O
, O
and O
vented O
on O
her O
the O
anger O
and O
vexation O
which O
overpowered O
him O
, O
upbraiding O
her O
not O
only O
with O
the O
death O
of O
Fitzclair S-PERSON
, O
but O
for O
having O
dared O
so O
to O
encourage O
young O
Fortescue S-PERSON
as O
to O
give O
him O
courage O
for O
his O
audacious O
proposal O
. O
To O
his O
astonishment O
, O
he O
was O
heard O
without O
any O
attempt O
at O
reply O
| | O
but O
he O
would O
have O
been O
startled O
, O
could O
he O
have O
seen O
the O
pallid O
cheek O
, O
compressed O
lip O
, O
and O
clenched O
hand O
with O
which O
, O
when O
he O
had O
left O
her O
, O
Eleanor S-PERSON
muttered O
— O
" O
Father O
, O
if O
it O
be O
sin O
to O
leave O
you O
, O
be O
it O
on O
your O
own O
head O
. O
I O
would O
have O
wedded O
with O
your O
consent O
, O
had O
you O
permitted O
it O
| | O
but O
now O
my O
destiny O
is O
fixed O
. O
There O
is O
no O
peace O
in O
England S-GPE
: O
at O
least O
let O
me O
be O
spared O
the O
agony O
of O
breaking O
another O
loving O
heart O
. O
" O
Nearly B-DATE
three I-DATE
weeks E-DATE
rolled O
on O
, O
and O
Eleanor's S-PERSON
extraordinary O
submission O
, O
and O
even O
in O
some O
degree O
withdrawal O
from O
society O
( O
for O
which O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
arrival O
was O
a O
good O
excuse O
) O
, O
caused O
her O
father's O
irritation O
against O
her O
almost O
entirely O
to O
subside O
. O
That O
she O
passed O
several B-TIME
hours E-TIME
each O
day O
apart O
from O
her O
sister O
, O
excited O
no O
surprise O
. O
Emmeline S-PERSON
was O
thankful O
even O
for O
her O
change O
of O
deportment O
, O
but O
nothing O
confidential O
ever O
again O
passed O
between O
them O
. O
That O
reports O
were O
floating O
about O
, O
connecting O
the O
names O
of O
Miss O
Manvers S-PERSON
and O
the O
late O
Lord O
Fitzclair S-PERSON
, O
seemed O
little O
heeded O
by O
Eleanor S-PERSON
, O
though O
they O
caused O
natural O
vexation O
to O
her O
family O
. O
About O
this O
time O
an O
invitation O
arrived O
for O
Eleanor S-PERSON
from O
a O
lady O
of O
rank O
, O
slightly O
known O
to O
her O
father O
, O
and O
living O
ten B-QUANTITY
miles E-QUANTITY
from O
Cheltenham S-GPE
in O
a O
beautiful O
villa O
, O
at O
which O
she O
expected O
a O
select O
party O
of O
fashionables O
to O
ruralize O
for O
a B-DATE
week I-DATE
or I-DATE
two E-DATE
. O
There O
was O
nothing O
in O
the O
note O
to O
excite O
the O
dread O
that O
weighed O
on O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
spirits O
, O
as O
Eleanor S-PERSON
carelessly O
threw O
it O
to O
her O
for O
her O
perusal O
, O
but O
she O
would O
not O
express O
it O
, O
as O
Lord O
Delmont S-PERSON
seemed O
inclined O
that O
Eleanor S-PERSON
should O
accept O
it O
, O
knowing O
that O
the O
lady O
was O
much O
too O
exclusive O
for O
Captain O
Fortescue S-PERSON
to O
join O
her O
guests O
, O
and O
believing O
that O
Eleanor's S-PERSON
apparent O
indifference O
to O
the O
visit O
originated O
from O
that O
cause O
. O
Telling O
her O
he O
was O
so O
gratified O
by O
her O
having O
devoted O
so O
many O
evenings O
to O
her O
sister O
, O
he O
added O
, O
she O
had O
his O
full O
consent O
to O
go O
if O
she O
liked O
, O
as O
he O
could O
better O
spare O
her O
than O
when O
Emmeline S-PERSON
returned O
to O
Oakwood S-GPE
. O
She O
quietly O
thanked O
him O
, O
but O
evinced O
no O
particular O
pleasure O
. O
The O
day O
before O
her O
intended O
departure O
, O
the O
sisters O
were O
sitting O
together O
, O
and O
little O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
who O
now O
ran O
firmly O
without O
any O
falls O
, O
was O
playing O
about O
the O
room O
. O
He O
had O
already O
displayed O
a O
high O
spirit O
and O
passionate O
temper O
, O
with O
their O
general O
accompaniment O
, O
self O
- O
will O
, O
even O
in O
trifles O
, O
that O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
felt O
would O
render O
her O
task O
a O
trying O
one O
| | O
but O
she O
was O
as O
firm O
as O
she O
was O
gentle O
, O
and O
faced O
the O
pain O
of O
contradicting O
her O
darling O
bravely O
: O
— O
" O
Do O
not O
touch O
that O
, O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
love O
, O
" O
she O
said O
, O
as O
her O
little O
boy O
stretched O
out O
his O
hand O
toward O
a O
beautiful O
but O
fragile O
toy O
, O
that O
stood O
with O
other O
nick O
- O
nacks O
on O
a O
low O
table O
. O
The O
child O
looked O
laughingly O
and O
archly O
toward O
her O
, O
and O
withdrew O
his O
hand O
, O
but O
did O
not O
move O
from O
the O
table O
. O
" O
Come O
here O
, O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
you O
have O
not O
played O
with O
these O
pretty O
things O
for O
a O
long O
time O
| | O
" O
and O
she O
took O
from O
her O
work O
- O
box O
some O
gayly O
colored O
ivory O
balls O
, O
which O
had O
been O
his O
favorite O
playthings O
, O
but O
just O
at O
present O
they O
had O
lost O
their O
charm O
, O
and O
the O
young O
gentleman O
did O
not O
move O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
knelt O
down O
by O
him O
, O
and O
said O
quietly O
: O
" O
My O
Percy S-PERSON
will O
not O
disobey O
mamma O
, O
will O
he O
? O
" O
" O
Me O
want O
that O
| | O
" O
he O
replied O
, O
in O
the O
pretty O
coaxing O
tone O
of O
infancy O
| | O
and O
he O
twined O
his O
little O
round O
arms O
caressingly O
round O
her O
neck O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
felt O
very O
much O
tempted O
to O
indulge O
him O
, O
but O
she O
resisted O
it O
. O
" O
But O
that O
is O
not O
a O
fit O
plaything O
for O
you O
, O
love O
| | O
besides O
, O
it O
is O
not O
mine O
, O
and O
we O
must O
not O
touch O
what O
is O
not O
ours O
. O
Come O
and O
see O
if O
we O
can O
not O
find O
something O
just O
as O
pretty O
, O
that O
you O
may O
have O
. O
" O
And O
after O
some O
minutes' O
merry O
play O
in O
her O
lap O
his O
mother O
hoped O
he O
had O
forgotten O
it O
| | O
but O
the O
little O
gentleman O
was O
not O
, O
he O
thought O
, O
to O
be O
so O
governed O
. O
The O
forbidden O
plaything O
was O
quietly O
grasped O
, O
and O
he O
seated O
himself O
on O
the O
ground O
, O
in O
silent O
but O
triumphant O
glee O
. O
Surprised O
at O
his O
sudden O
silence O
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
looked O
toward O
him O
. O
It O
was O
his O
first S-ORDINAL
act O
of O
decided O
disobedience O
, O
and O
she O
knew O
she O
must O
not O
waver O
. O
Young O
as O
he O
was O
, O
he O
had O
already O
learned O
to O
know O
when O
she O
was O
displeased O
, O
and O
when O
she O
desired O
him O
very O
gravely O
to O
give O
her O
the O
toy O
, O
he O
passionately O
threw O
it O
down O
, O
and O
burst O
into O
a O
violent O
fit O
of O
crying O
. O
His O
nurse O
took O
him O
struggling O
from O
the O
room O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
quietly O
resumed O
her O
work O
| | O
but O
there O
was O
such O
an O
expression O
of O
pain O
in O
her O
countenance O
, O
that O
Eleanor S-PERSON
exclaimed O
, O
" O
Emmeline S-PERSON
! O
I O
have O
been O
watching O
you O
for O
the B-TIME
last I-TIME
half I-TIME
hour E-TIME
, O
and O
I O
can O
not O
comprehend O
you O
. O
Do O
explain O
yourself O
. O
" O
" O
I O
will O
if O
I O
can O
| | O
" O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
looked O
up O
, O
and O
smiled O
. O
" O
Why O
would O
you O
not O
let O
that O
poor O
little O
Percy S-PERSON
have O
that O
toy O
? O
" O
" O
Because O
it O
would O
have O
been O
encouraging O
his O
touching O
or O
taking O
every O
thing O
he O
sees O
, O
whether O
proper O
for O
him O
or O
not O
. O
" O
" O
But O
he O
could O
not O
understand O
that O
. O
" O
" O
Not O
now O
, O
perhaps O
| | O
but O
I O
wish O
him O
to O
know O
that O
when O
I O
speak O
, O
he O
must O
obey O
me O
. O
It O
is O
, O
I O
think O
, O
a O
mistaken O
doctrine O
, O
that O
we O
ought O
to O
give O
children O
a O
reason O
for O
all O
we O
desire O
them O
to O
do O
. O
Obedience O
can O
then O
never O
be O
prompt O
, O
as O
it O
ought O
to O
be O
. O
And O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
if O
we O
wait O
until O
they O
are O
old O
enough O
to O
understand O
the O
reasons O
for O
a O
command O
, O
the O
task O
will O
be O
much O
more O
difficult O
, O
from O
the O
ascendency O
which O
willfulness O
may O
already O
have O
obtained O
. O
" O
" O
But O
then O
why O
were O
you O
so O
cruel O
as O
to O
send O
the O
poor O
child O
up O
- O
stairs O
? O
Was O
it O
not O
enough O
to O
take O
the O
toy O
from O
him O
? O
" O
" O
Not O
quite O
| | O
for O
him O
to O
remember O
that O
he O
must O
not O
touch O
it O
again O
. O
" O
" O
And O
do O
you O
really O
think O
he O
will O
not O
? O
" O
" O
I O
can O
only O
hope O
so O
, O
Eleanor S-PERSON
| | O
but O
I O
must O
not O
be O
disheartened O
if O
he O
do O
. O
He O
is O
an O
infant O
still O
, O
and O
I O
can O
not O
expect O
him O
to O
learn O
such O
a O
difficult O
lesson O
as O
obedience O
in O
one O
, O
two S-CARDINAL
, O
or O
six S-CARDINAL
lessons O
. O
" O
" O
And O
will O
he O
love O
you O
as O
much O
as O
if O
you O
had O
given O
it O
to O
him O
? O
" O
" O
Not O
at O
the O
moment O
, O
perhaps O
, O
but O
when O
he O
is O
older O
he O
will O
love O
me O
more O
. O
And O
it O
is O
that O
hope O
which O
reconciles O
me O
to O
the O
pain O
which O
refusing O
to O
indulge O
him O
costs O
me O
now O
. O
" O
" O
And O
voluntarily O
you O
will O
bear O
the O
pain O
which O
had O
almost O
brought O
tears O
into O
the O
eyes O
of O
the O
severe O
and O
stoical O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
! O
" O
exclaimed O
Eleanor S-PERSON
. O
" O
It O
was O
a O
foolish O
weakness O
, O
my O
dear O
Eleanor S-PERSON
, O
for O
which O
my O
husband O
would O
have O
chidden O
me O

there O
must O
be O
pain O
to O
a O
mother O
if O
called O
upon O
to O
exert O
authority O

when O
inclination O
so O
strongly O
points O

you O
are O

really O
can O
not O
imagine O
what O
harm O

myself O

could O
possibly O
have O
done O

may O
you O
have O
strength O
of O
mind O

self O

control O
sufficient O
to O

future O
years O

" O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
spoke O
impressively O
, O
and O
something O
, O
either O
in O
her O
words O
or O
tone O
, O
caused O
the O
blood O
to O
rush O
into O
Eleanor's S-PERSON
cheeks O
, O
and O
she O
hastily O
walked O
to O
the O
window O

then O
, O
as O
abruptly O
returning O
, O
she O
kissed O
her O
sister O
, O
a O
very O
rare O
token O
of O
affection O
, O
and O
declaring O
she O
was O
much O
too O
good O
for O
her O
to O
understand O
, O
quitted O
the O
room O

The O
following O
day O
, O
dressed O
for O
her O
visit O

only O
waiting O
for O
the O
carriage O

Eleanor S-PERSON
, O
accompanied O
by O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON

her O
little O
boys O

entered O
the O
same O
apartment O
. O
Though O
not O
in O
general O
fond O
of O
nursing O
, O
Eleanor S-PERSON
had O
taken O
Herbert S-PERSON
in O
her O
arms O
, O
and O
was O
playing O
with O
him O
with O
unusual O
fondness O

Percy S-PERSON

who O
had O
not O

the O
tempting O
plaything O

his O
banishment O
the B-DATE

the O
moment O
his O
eye O
caught O
it O

to O
the O
astonishment O
of O
Eleanor S-PERSON

ran O
up O
to O
his O
mother O

lisping O

" O
Me O
no O
touch O

Percy S-PERSON
good O
boy O
now O

held O
up O
his O
little O
face O
lovingly O
to O
hers O
, O
and O
with O
a O
very O
pardonable O
feeling O
of O
delight O
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
lifted O
him O
up O

covered O
him O
with O
kisses O

The O
feelings O
which O
thrilled O
through O
Eleanor S-PERSON
at O
that O
moment O
she O
might O
indeed O
have O
found O
it O
difficult O
to O
explain O
, O
but O
she O
was O
so O
conscious O
of O
a O
change O
of O
countenance O
as O
to O
hide O
her O
face O
on O
Herbert's S-PERSON
head O
. O
It O
might O
have O
been O
obedience O

disobedience O
brought O
so O
suddenly O

strangely O
in O
contrast O
— O
and O
who O
were O
the O
actors O
? O
an O
infant O

herself O

For O
a B-TIME
minute E-TIME
she O
recovered O
, O
stricken O
with O
sudden O
and O
agonized O
remorse O

but O
it O
was O
too O
late O
, O
she O
had O
gone O
too O
far O
, O
and O
the O
announcement O
of O
the O
carriage O
was O
a O
relief O
from O
that O
bitter O
moment O
of O
painful O
indecision O
. O
Placing O
her O
baby O
nephew O
in O
his O
nurse's O
arms O
, O
she O
said O
, O
caressingly O
, O
" O
Will O
not O
Percy S-PERSON
give O
Lina S-PERSON
some O
of O
those O
kisses O
as O
well O
as O
mamma O
? O
" O
The O
child O
threw O
one S-CARDINAL
little O
arm O
round O
her O
neck O
, O
and O
the O
other O
round O
that O
of O
his O
mother O
, O
and O
then O
burst O
into O
a O
merry O
laugh O
at O
thus O
seeing O
himself O
as O
it O
were O
a O
link O
between O
them O

Never O
had O
it O
seemed O
to O
Eleanor S-PERSON
that O
she O
had O
loved O
and O
admired O
her O
sister O
as O
she O
did O
at O
that O
moment O

all O
the O
neglect O
, O
unkindness O
, O
she O
had O
shown O
her O
, O
all O
the O
sarcasm O
and O
satire O
, O
of O
which O
, O
either O
before O
or O
behind O
her O
, O
she O
had O
so O
often O
made O
her O
the O
victim O
, O
combined O
with O
an O
intense O
, O
but O
how O
painfully O
vain O
longing O
to O
have O
resembled O
her O
in O
the O
remotest O
degree O
, O
rather O
than O
be O
the O
character O
which O
had O
never O
before O
appeared O
so O
degraded O
, O
so O
hateful O
— O
almost O
overpowered O
her O
— O
a O
convulsive O
sob O
escaped O
her O
as O
she O
clasped O
Emmeline S-PERSON
in O
a O
close O
embrace O

almost O
choked O
her O

good O

Mr. O

in O
the O
hall O

delighted O
at O

child O

— O
A O
HEART O
AND O
HOME O
IN O
INDIA S-GPE
. O
From O
the O
moment O
Arthur B-PERSON
Hamilton E-PERSON
returned O
to O
Cheltenham S-GPE
with O
the O
painful O
intelligence O
that O
he O
had O
arrived O
at O
Leith S-GPE
only O
in O
time O
to O
witness O
the O
departure O
of O
the O
beautiful O
vessel O
which O
contained O
Captain O
Fortescue S-PERSON
and O
the O
exquisitely O
lovely O
bride O
who O
had O
, O
it O
seemed O
, O
turned O
the O
heads O
of O
all O
the O
usually O
quiet O
Scotsmen S-NORP
who O
had O
seen O
her O
, O
Lord O
Delmont S-PERSON
gradually O
sunk O
. O
The O
agony O
of O
losing O
her O
forever O
— O
for O
so O
he O
regarded O
her O
departure O
for O
, O
and O
residence O
in O
India S-GPE
for O
an O
indeterminate O
time O
— O
conquered O
every O
other O
feeling O
. O
Her O
conduct O
had O
caused O
emotions O
of O
anguish O
far O
too O
deep O
for O
the O
relieving O
sensation O
of O
anger O
. O
The O
name O
of O
the O
lady O
from O
whose O
house O
and O
by O
whose O
connivance O
she O
had O
eloped O
, O
he O
was O
never O
heard O
to O
breathe O
| | O
but O
, O
if O
ever O
casually O
mentioned O
before O
him O
, O
every O
feature O
would O
become O
convulsed O
, O
and O
he O
would O
instantly O
leave O
the O
room O
. O
Often O
and O
often O
he O
accused O
his O
own O
harshness O
as O
the O
cause O
of O
driving O
her O
from O
him O
, O
and O
then O
came O
, O
with O
overwhelming O
bitterness O
, O
the O
thought O
that O
if O
he O
lately O
had O
been O
harsh O
, O
surely O
the O
recollection O
of O
all O
the O
indulgent O
fondness O
he O
had O
shown O
demanded O
some O
gratitude O
in O
return O
. O
If O
she O
had O
but O
written O
, O
had O
but O
expressed O
one O
wish O
for O
his O
continued O
love O
, O
one O
regret O
for O
his O
present O
pain O
! O
But O
no O
letter O
came O
, O
and O
the O
contending O
but O
all O
- O
depressing O
emotions O
so O
completely O
undermined O
a O
constitution O
never O
very O
strong O
, O
and O
already O
worn O
by O
care O
, O
that O
when O
another O
and O
still O
heavier O
trial O
came O
, O
he O
sunk O
at O
once O
beneath O
it O
. O
Though O
Eleanor S-PERSON
had O
been O
his O
favorite O
, O
his O
feelings O
of O
pride O
and O
hope O
had O
greatly O
centered O
in O
his O
son O
, O
whose O
career O
, O
in O
five B-DATE
years' E-DATE
active O
service O
on O
board O
a O
man O
- O
of O
- O
war O
, O
had O
been O
such O
as O
to O
raise O
him O
already O
to O
a O
lieutenancy O
, O
and O
excite O
every O
gratifying O
emotion O
, O
not O
only O
in O
his O
immediate O
family O
, O
but O
in O
a O
large O
circle O
of O
admiring O
friends O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
love O
for O
her O
brother O
had O
naturally O
increased O
, O
strong O
as O
it O
always O
had O
been O
, O
even O
in O
childhood O
— O
and O
the O
visits O
which O
Charles S-PERSON
had O
been O
enabled O
to O
make O
to O
Oakwood S-GPE
, O
brief O
in O
duration O
as O
they O
were O
compelled O
to O
be O
, O
had O
always O
been O
fraught O
with O
heartfelt O
, O
joyous O
happiness O
, O
not O
only O
to O
herself O
but O
to O
her O
husband O
. O
The O
pain O
and O
anxiety O
attendant O
on O
Eleanor's O
elopement O
, O
and O
the O
dread O
of O
its O
effects O
on O
Lord O
Delmont S-PERSON
, O
had O
for O
two B-DATE
or I-DATE
three I-DATE
months E-DATE
been O
the O
sole O
subject O
of O
thought O
| | O
but O
at O
length O
, O
and O
, O
like O
a O
fearful O
flash O
bringing O
a O
new O
sorrow O
to O
light O
, O
it O
pressed O
upon O
them O
that O
it O
was O
long O
after O
the O
period O
that O
intelligence O
of O
Charles S-PERSON
ought O
to O
have O
been O
received O
. O
Still O
hoping O
against O
hope O
, O
not O
only O
the O
Delmont S-PERSON
family O
, O
but O
all O
who O
had O
friends O
and O
relatives O
on O
board O
the O
Leander S-PERSON
, O
imagined O
that O
she O
might O
have O
drifted O
from O
her O
course O
, O
or O
been O
engaged O
on O
some O
secret O
and O
distant O
expedition O
, O
but O
that O
intelligence O
concerning O
her O
would O
and O
must O
soon O
come O
. O
Alas O
! O
after O
months S-DATE
of O
agonizing O
suspense O
, O
information O
was O
received O
that O
several O
planks O
and O
masts O
, O
bearing O
evidence O
of O
fire O
as O
well O
as O
water O
, O
and O
some O
sea-chests O
, O
bearing O
names O
, O
only O
too O
soon O
recognized O
as O
those O
of O
some O
of O
the O
Leander's S-ORG
crew O
, O
had O
been O
cast O
off O
the O
coast O
of O
Barbary S-LOC
, O
and O
there O
could O
be O
no O
more O
doubt O
that O
death O
or O
slavery O
— O
that O
fearful O
slavery O
which O
the O
bombardment O
of O
Algiers S-GPE
had O
so O
displayed O
to O
European S-NORP
eyes O
— O
was O
the O
portion O
of O
all O
those O
beloved O
ones O
, O
for O
whom O
so O
many O
aching O
hearts O
and O
eyes O
had O
watched O
and O
wept O
in O
vain O
. O
It O
was O
a O
trial O
so O
terrible O
that O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
felt O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
as O
if O
even O
submission O
had O
departed O
from O
her O
| | O
and O
she O
could O
almost O
have O
rebelled O
in O
spirit O
against O
the O
inscrutable O
decree O
, O
that O
had O
consigned O
one O
so O
free O
from O
vice O
and O
evil O
, O
so O
full O
of O
happiness O
and O
worth O
, O
to O
a O
doom O
so O
terrible O
. O
Much O
as O
she O
had O
loved O
and O
reverenced O
her O
husband O
before O
, O
she O
seemed O
never O
to O
have O
felt O
his O
worth O
and O
tenderness O
till O
then O
. O
It O
was O
his O
sympathy O
, O
his O
strength O
, O
that O
recalled O
her O
to O
a O
sense O
of O
her O
duty O
, O
and O
gave O
her O
power O
to O
endure O
, O
by O
a O
realization O
once O
more O
of O
that O
submissiveness O
to O
a O
Father's O
will O
, O
which O
had O
never O
before O
failed O
her O
. O
But O
time O
, O
though O
it O
softened O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
anguish O
, O
had O
no O
power O
over O
the O
memories O
of O
this O
brother O
, O
not O
even O
when O
the O
increasing O
cares O
and O
joys O
of O
maternity O
so O
fully O
engrossed O
her O
, O
that O
the O
present O
and O
the O
future O
of O
her O
children O
appeared O
to O
have O
banished O
all O
of O
her O
own O
past O
. O
Lord O
Delmont S-PERSON
did O
not O
survive O
the O
mournful O
tidings O
of O
the O
certain O
wreck O
of O
the O
Leander S-PERSON
above O
two B-DATE
months E-DATE

but O
his O
released O
spirit O
did O
not O
meet O
that O
of O
his O
son O

Charles S-PERSON
was O
not O
dead O

toiled O
as O
a O
slave O
long O
years O

before O
there O
was O
even O
a O
partial O
amelioration O
of O
his O
sufferings O

But O
no O

Years O
rolled O
on O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
lot O
was O
so O
full O
of O
tranquil O
happiness O

so O
fraught O
with O
the O
innumerable O
daily O
joys O
of O
a O
loving O
wife O
and O
devoted O
mother O
, O
that O
her O
prayer O
was O
ever O
rising O
for O
guidance O
, O
and O
gratitude O

that O
prosperity O
might O

the O
dark O
days O

trial O

adversity O

when O
they O
should O

more O
regard O

than O
even O
the O
cultivation O

She O
was O
one O
of O
those O

thought O
still O
more O
of O
the O

The O
thought O
of O
Eleanor S-PERSON
was O
the O
only O
dark O
shade O
in O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
life O
. O
She O
had O
written O
to O
her O
often O
, O
but O
communication O
with O
India S-GPE
was O
not O
then O
what O
it O
is O
now O

her O
letters O
might O
not O

destination O

Captain O
Fortescue S-PERSON

himself O
constantly O
changing O

Whatever O
the O

( O
for O
Eleanor's S-PERSON
letters O

Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
thought O
, O
might O
also O
have O
miscarried O

, O
she O
heard O
nothing O
of O
her O
till O
the O
hurried O
epistle O
commenced O
by O
her O
sister O
, O
and O
finished O
by O
Mr. O
Myrvin S-PERSON
, O
brought O
the O
startling O
intelligence O
that O
she O
was O
a O
widow O
and O
dying O
, O
unable O
to O
reach O
Oakwood S-GPE
, O
where O
she O
had O
hoped O
at O

to O
have O
sufficient O
strength O
to O
bring O
her O
children O

implore O
for O
them O
protection O

come O

The O
letter O
, O
imperfectly O
directed O
, O
had O
been O
days S-DATE

its O
journey O

it O
was O
with O
the O
most O
melancholy O
forebodings O
Mr. O

Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
had O
started O
for O
Llangwillan S-PERSON

many O
years O
after O
Edward S-PERSON

Ellen B-PERSON
Fortescue E-PERSON

Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON

acquainted O
with O
all O
the O

childhood O

it O
is O
necessary O
that O
our O

should O
be O
rather O
more O
enlightened O

otherwise O
the O
character O
of O
Ellen S-PERSON
may O
be O
to O
them O
as O
unnatural O
and O
as O
incomprehensible O
as O
it O
was O
to O
her O
aunt O
. O
That O
Eleanor S-PERSON
could O
realize O
true O
happiness O
in O
a O
marriage O
entered O
into O
only O
because O
she O
could O
not O
bear O
the O
torture O
of O
her O
own O
thoughts O

and O
her O
constant O
dread O
of O
the O
world's O
contumely O
, O
was O
not O
likely O
. O
At O
first S-ORDINAL

indeed O
, O
it O
was O
a O
very O
delightful O
thing O
to O
find O
herself O
the O

of O
devotion O

brilliant O

Though O
Captain O

sometimes O

his O

pre-eminent O

For O
the B-DATE
first I-DATE
three I-DATE

four I-DATE

, O
the O
pride O
he O
felt O
in O
seeing O
her O
so O
universally O
admired O

in O
the O
greater O
attention O
he O
received O
for O
her O
sake O

compensated O

or O
concealed O
the O
qualities O

a O
soldier's O

he O
had O
fondly O

But O
as O
his O
health O
, O
always O
delicate O

became O
more O

more O
undermined O

compelled O
him O

measure O

and O
to O
look O
for O
the O
quiet O
pleasures O

domestic O
life O

he O
found O
, O
and O
bitter O
was O
that O
first S-ORDINAL
awakening O
, O
that O
his O
wishes O

were O
of O
no O

She O
could O
not O
resign O
the O
pleasures O
of O
society O
— O
of O
still O
being O
enabled O
to O
pursue O
the O
dangerous O
amusement O
of O
her O
girlhood O
( O
though O
so O
guardedly O
that O
not O
a O
rumor O
against O
her O
ever O
found O
breath O
) O
, O
for O
the O
dullness O
of O
her O
home O

Yet O
still O
he O
loved O
her O

and O
when O
Eleanor S-PERSON
, O
with O
all O
the O
fascinating O
playfulness O
of O
her O
former O
self O
, O
would O
caress O
and O
try O
to O
persuade O
him O
to O
go O
out O
with O
her O
, O
and O
not O
sit O
moping O
at O
home O
, O
and O
that O
if O
he O
would O
, O
she O
would O
behave O
just O
as O
he O
liked O
, O

if O
he O
did O
not O
care O
to O
see O
her O
surrounded O
, O
as O
she O
knew O
she O
was O
, O
by O
red O
coats O

she O
would O
dismiss O
them O
all O

devote O
herself O
to O
him O
— O
but O
indeed O
she O
could O
not O
stay O
at O
home O
— O
he O
would O
feel O
that O
it O
would O
be O
cruel O
indeed O
to O
chain O
such O
a O
being O
to O
his O
side O
, O
and O
sometimes O
make O
the O
exertion O
( O
for O
which O
he O
was O
little O
fitted O
) O
to O
accompany O
her O

at O
others O
, O
with O
kind O
words O
and O
indulgent O
love O

permit O
her O
to O
follow O
her O
own O
wishes O
, O
and O
remain O
alone O
. O
But O
little O
did O
he O
think O
the O
real O
reason O
that O
Eleanor S-PERSON
could O
not O
rest O
in O
quiet O
at O
home O
. O
The O
recollection O
of O
Lord O
Fitzclair S-PERSON
was O
at O
such O
times O
so O
fearfully O
vivid O
, O
that O
the O
very O
agony O
she O
had O
endured O
when O
first S-ORDINAL
told O
of O
his O
fearful O
end O
would O
return O
in O
all O
its O
intensity O
| | O
the O
thought O
: O
Had O
her O
father O
really O
cursed O
her O
for O
her O
disobedience O
, O
and O
was O
it O
that O
forever O
hovering O
round O
her O
, O
preventing O
any O
thing O
like O
lasting O
happiness O
. O
And O
yet O
, O
by O
a O
strange O
contradiction O
, O
while O
the O
idea O
of O
her O
father's O
curse O
shook O
her O
whole O
frame O
at O
times O
with O
convulsive O
sobs O
, O
pride O
, O
that O
most O
fatal O
ingredient O
of O
her O
character O
, O
utterly O
prevented O
all O
attempt O
on O
her O
part O
to O
communicate O
with O
her O
relations O
. O
She O
said O
, O
as O
they O
had O
made O
no O
effort O
to O
conciliate O
, O
she O
would O
not O
| | O
and O
yet O
the O
longing O
for O
Emmeline S-PERSON
sometimes O
became O
actually O
painful O
. O
Eleanor S-PERSON
was O
never O
intended O
for O
the O
heartless O
, O
reckless O
being O
she O
had O
tried O
to O
become O
. O
It O
was O
a O
constant O
and O
most O
terrible O
struggle O
between O
the O
good O
and O
evil O
parts O
of O
her O
nature O
, O
and O
though O
the O
evil O
triumphed O
— O
in O
the O
determination O
that O
nothing O
should O
change O
her O
course O
of O
action O
, O
nothing O
compel O
her O
to O
acknowledge O
she O
had O
ever O
been O
in O
the O
wrong O
, O
and O
was O
really O
not O
the O
perfect O
creature O
which O
flattery O
was O
ever O
ready O
to O
pour O
into O
her O
ear O
— O
the O
good O
had O
yet O
so O
much O
power O
as O
to O
make O
her O
miserable O
, O
by O
the O
conviction O
, O
that O
she O
was O
not O
what O
she O
might O
have O
been O
— O
that O
she O
never O
could O
be O
happy O
— O
that O
every O
pleasure O
was O
hollow O
, O
every O
amusement O
vain O
. O
Again O
and O
again O
the O
memories O
of O
Emmeline's O
gentle O
, O
sustaining O
, O
ever O
active O
piety O
would O
come O
before O
her O
, O
as O
if O
beseeching O
her O
to O
seek O
the O
only O
fount O
of O
peace O
| | O
but O
so O
terrible O
was O
the O
self O
- O
reproach O
, O
the O
anguish O
which O
the O
thought O
called O
up O
, O
that O
she O
always O
turned O
from O
it O
with O
a O
shudder O
, O
resolved O
that O
religion O
was O
never O
meant O
for O
such O
as O
herself O
, O
and O
that O
its O
restrictions O
should O
never O
enter O
her O
mind O
, O
or O
its O
dictates O
pass O
her O
lips O
. O
With O
the O
awakening O
intelligence O
of O
her O
son O
, O
however O
, O
there O
seemed O
one S-CARDINAL
pleasure O
not O
wholly O
hollow O
— O
one S-CARDINAL
enjoyment O
without O
the O
shadow O
of O
alloy O
| | O
and O
she O
grasped O
it O
with O
an O
avidity O
and O
a O
constancy O
, O
that O
in O
a O
character O
generally O
so O
wavering O
and O
inconsistent O
was O
almost O
incredible O
. O
That O
her O
son O
was O
from O
his O
earliest O
infancy O
the O
image O
of O
herself O
, O
might O
have O
added O
strength O
to O
the O
feeling O
| | O
but O
the O
intense O
love O
, O
almost O
idolatry O
, O
she O
felt O
toward O
him O
, O
increasing O
with O
his O
growth O
, O
did O
much O
toward O
banishing O
the O
unpleasant O
feelings O
of O
remorse O
and O
home O
- O
sickness O
. O
She O
devoted O
herself O
to O
her O
boy O
, O
not O
judiciously O
indeed O
, O
for O
she O
was O
not O
one O
to O
practice O
self O
- O
denial O
in O
education O
| | O
and O
as O
Edward's S-PERSON
disposition O
was O
not O
one O
to O
cause O
her O
annoyance O
, O
even O
from O
over O
- O
indulgence O
, O
there O
was O
not O
even O
the O
check O
of O
his O
ill O
- O
temper O
or O
rudeness O
toward O
herself O
, O
to O
whisper O
the O
fearful O
evil O
she O
was O
engendering O
. O
What O
was O
the O
emotion O
which O
had O
so O
riveted O
her O
to O
her O
son O
, O
it O
might O
have O
been O
difficult O
to O
ascertain O
| | O
it O
could O
scarcely O
have O
been O
the O
mere O
instinct O
of O
maternity O
, O
for O
then O
it O
would O
have O
extended O
to O
her O
daughter O
| | O
but O
as O
complete O
as O
was O
her O
indulgence O
to O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
so O
was O
her O
neglect O
of O
Ellen S-PERSON

Colonel O
Fortescue S-PERSON
( O
for O
he O
had O
gradually O
attained O
that O
rank O

borne O
, O
without O
complaint O

neglect O
of O
himself O

nay O
, O
it O
had O
not O
had O
power O
in O
the O
least O
degree O
to O
diminish O
his O
love O
, O
though O
it O
might O
have O
awakened O
him O
to O
the O
consciousness O
that O
his O
wife O
was O
indeed O
not O
perfect O

Her O
devotion O
to O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
even O
undertaking O
the O
toilsome O
task O
of O
instruction O
, O
had O
delighted O
him O

for O
, O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
, O
having O
been O
much O
from O
home O
, O
he O
was O
not O
conscious O
of O
the O
lonely O
fate O
of O
his O
little O
girl O

but O
when O
the O
truth O
became O
evident O
, O
that O
she O
was O
an O
object O
almost O
of O
dislike O
— O
that O
she O
was O
left O
entirely O
to O
the O
tender O
mercies O
of O
a O
hireling O
, O
and O
Eleanor S-PERSON
only O
alluded O
to O
her O
, O
to O
contrast O
her O
peevishness O
and O
stupidity O
with O
Edward's S-PERSON
happiness O
and O
intellect O
, O
all O
the O
father O
was O
roused O
within O
him O
, O
and O
, O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
, O
he O
felt O
and O
expressed O
serious O
displeasure O

He O
acknowledged O
that O
his O
son O
might O
, O
indeed O
, O
be O
superior O
in O
beauty O
and O
talent O
, O
but O
he O
would O
not O
allow O
that O
Ellen's S-PERSON
affections O
were O
less O
warm O

or O
her O

Continually O

for O
she O
inherited O
her O
father's O
constitution O
, O
the O
poor O
little O
infant O
was O
constantly O
crying O
or O
fretful O

which O
Eleanor S-PERSON

never O
having O
known O
what O
illness O
was O
, O
attributed O
at O
once O
to O
a O
naturally O
evil O
temper O
which O
annoyed O
her O

The O
nurse O
, O
as O
ignorant O
as O
she O
was O
obsequious O
, O
adopted O
the O

opinion O

and O
, O
before O
she O
was O
even O
three B-DATE
years I-DATE

, O
harshness O
, O
both O
by O
nurse O
and O
mother O
, O
had O
been O
constantly O
used O
, O
to O
make O
Ellen S-PERSON
as O
good O
a O
child O
as O
her O
brother O
. O
In O
vain O
did O
the O
colonel O
, O
when O
he O
became O
aware O
of O
this O
treatment O
, O
remonstrate O
that O
it O
was O
the O
illness O
of O
the O
poor O
child O
— O
neither O
obstinacy O
nor O
ill O
- O
temper O
: O
his O
wife O
would O
not O
understand O
him O
, O
and O
at O
length O
he O
sternly O
and O
peremptorily O
declared O
, O
that O
as O
she O
had O
her O
will O
with O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
he O
would O
have O
his O
with O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
and O
that O
no O
chastisement O
should O
be O
inflicted O
. O
If O
she O
did O
wrong O
, O
he O
was O
to O
be O
told O
of O
it O
, O
and O
if O
necessary O
he O
would O
reprove O
her O
, O
but O
he O
would O
allow O
no O
other O
interference O
. O
Mrs. O
Fortescue S-PERSON
made O
not O
the O
least O
objection O
, O
believing O
that O
as O
her O
husband O
had O
thus O
taken O
her O
in O
charge O
, O
she O
was O
exonerated O
from O
all O
blame O
if O
she O
left O
her O
entirely O
to O
him O
. O
Only O
too O
quickly O
did O
the O
poor O
child O
discover O
that O
the O
lovely O
being O
whom O
she O
called O
mother O
, O
and O
whom O
she O
loved O
so O
fondly O
, O
had O
no O
love O
, O
no O
caress O
for O
her O
. O
Repeated O
punishment O
, O
though O
it O
had O
only O
extended O
to O
her O
fifth S-ORDINAL
year O
, O
had O
completely O
crushed O
the O
gentle O
, O
tender O
spirit O
, O
that O
had O
required O
such O
judicious O
nursing O
| | O
and O
combined O
with O
physical O
suffering O
, O
instead O
of O
deadening O
the O
feelings O
, O
as O
in O
some O
dispositions O
it O
would O
have O
done O
, O
had O
rendered O
them O
morbidly O
acute O
— O
an O
effect O
which O
constant O
loneliness O
naturally O
deepened O
. O
Her O
father's O
love O
and O
caresses O
had O
caused O
her O
to O
cling O
to O
him O
so O
passionately O
, O
that O
every O
word O
he O
said O
, O
every O
request O
he O
made O
her O
, O
was O
treasured O
and O
thought O
upon O
, O
when O
he O
was O
away O
from O
her O
, O
with O
a O
tenacity O
many O
would O
have O
fancied O
unnatural O
in O
a O
child O
. O
He O
taught O
her O
, O
though O
his O
heart O
often O
bled O
as O
he O
did O
so O
( O
for O
what O
claim O
had O
her O
mother O
upon O
the O
feelings O
he O
sought O
to O
inculcate O
) O
, O
to O
love O
, O
honor O
, O
and O
obey O
her O
mother O
in O
all O
things O
| | O
that O
if O
she O
did O
so O
, O
she O
would O
be O
as O
happy O
as O
Edward S-PERSON
in O
time O
, O
and O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
though O
she O
did O
not O
understand O
him O
, O
obeyed O
| | O
but O
Colonel O
Fortescue S-PERSON
little O
imagined O
the O
evil O
which O
was O
accruing O
from O
these O
very O
natural O
lessons O
. O
Ellen S-PERSON
learned O
to O
believe O
that O
, O
as O
her O
mother O
never O
noticed O
her O
, O
except O
in O
accounts O
of O
anger O
or O
irritation O
, O
it O
must O
be O
her O
own O
fault O
. O
She O
longed O
to O
be O
beautiful O
and O
buoyant O
as O
Edward S-PERSON
| | O
and O
that O
she O
was O
neither O
, O
marked O
her O
in O
her O
own O
young O
mind O
as O
so O
inferior O
, O
it O
was O
no O
wonder O
her O
mother O
could O
not O
caress O
or O
love O
her O
. O
Had O
Edward S-PERSON
presumed O
on O
his O
favoritism O
, O
and O
been O
unkind O
or O
neglectful O
, O
she O
might O
, O
perhaps O
, O
have O
envied O
more O
than O
she O
loved O
him O
| | O
but O
his O
disposition O
was O
naturally O
so O
noble O
, O
so O
open O
- O
hearted O
, O
so O
generous O
, O
that O
he O
always O
treated O
her O
with O
affection O
, O
and O
would O
share O
with O
her O
his O
playthings O
and O
sweets O
, O
even O
while O
he O
could O
not O
but O
believe O
her O
in O
all O
things O
his O
inferior O
| | O
and O
that O
as O
such O
, O
of O
course O
, O
her O
wishes O
could O
never O
cross O
with O
his O
. O
Poor O
child O
, O
she O
scarcely O
knew O
what O
it O
was O
to O
wish O
, O
except O
that O
she O
might O
cling O
to O
her O
mother O
as O
she O
did O
to O
her O
father O
, O
and O
that O
she O
could O
but O
be O
good O
and O
beautiful O
enough O
to O
win O
her O
love O
! O
The O
lesson O
of O
concealment O
of O
every O
feeling O
is O
but O
too O
easily O
and O
too O
early O
learned O
. O
Tears O
do O
not O
flow O
even O
from O
childhood O
, O
when O
always O
rudely O
checked O
, O
and O
angrily O
reproved O
. O
Affection O
can O
not O
display O
itself O
unless O
called O
forth O
| | O
and O
so O
the O
very O
outward O
seeming O
of O
children O
is O
more O
in O
a O
parent's O
hand O
than O
mere O
superficial O
observers O
may O
believe O
: O
and O
Mrs. O
Fortescue S-PERSON
blamed O
and O
disliked O
the O
cold O
inanimate O
exterior O
which O
she O
had O
never O
tried O
to O
warm O
. O
Ellen's S-PERSON

difficulty O
in O
acquiring O
knowledge O
, O
compared O
with O
Edward's S-PERSON
extraordinary O
quickness O
, O
only O
confirmed O
her O
painful O
conviction O
of O
her O
great O
inferiority O
, O
the O
impossibility O
of O
her O
ever O
winning O
love O

consequent O
increased O
intensity O
of O
her O
affection O
for O

father O

loved O
her O
notwithstanding O

That O
the O
child O
herself O
could O
not O
have O
defined O
these O
sensations O
is O
true O

existence O

nine B-DATE

the O
earnest O

less O

perhaps O
, O
for O
the O
actual O
amount O

that O

DOMESTIC O
DISCORD O

END O

The O
displeasure O
of O
her O
husband O
, O
his O
reproaches O
for O
her O
conduct O
to O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
by O
causing O
some O
degree O
of O
annoyance O
, O
increased O
Mrs. O
Fortescue's S-PERSON
feelings O
of O
dislike O
toward O
the O
object O
who O
had O
caused O
it O
, O
and O
this O
was O
soon O
afterward O
heightened O
by O
self O

reproach O

A O
malignant O
fever O
broke O
out O
in O
the O
British S-NORP
settlement O
where O
Colonel O
Fortescue S-PERSON
was O
stationed O

his O
wife O
and O
children O
were O
with O
him O
, O
and O
, O
dreadfully O
alarmed O

Eleanor S-PERSON
determined O
to O
remove O
with O
her O
children O
to O
some O
less O
unhealthy O
spot O
. O
The O
colonel O
willingly O
consented O

their O
hasty O
preparations O
were O
concluded O
Ellen S-PERSON
sickened O
. O
Alarm O
for O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
however O
, O
so O
engrossed O
the O
mother O
, O
that O
she O
appeared O
incapable O
of O
any O
other O
thought O
. O
In O
vain O
Colonel O
Fortescue S-PERSON
urged O
that O
his O
son O
would O
be O
safe O
with O
the O
friends O
who O
had O
promised O
to O
take O
charge O
of O
him O
, O
and O
who O
were O
on O
the O
point O
of O
leaving O
the O
city O

that O
there O
were O
none O
on O
whom O
he O
could O
depend O
so O
to O
tend O
the O
little O
sufferer O
as O
not O
to O
require O
a O
guiding O
head O
, O
and O
she O
knew O
how O
impossible O
it O
was O
for O
him O
to O
be O
with O
his O
child O
as O
his O
heart O
prompted O
. O
He O
urged O
, O
entreated O
, O
commanded O
in O
vain O
, O
Mrs. O
Fortescue S-PERSON
was O
inexorable O
. O
She O
declared O
that O
the O
idea O
of O
her O
son O
being O
away O
from O
her O
at O
such O
a O
time O
would O
drive O
her O
mad O

and O
as O
for O
duty O
, O
one S-CARDINAL
child O
demanded O
her O
care O
as O
much O
as O
another O
| | O
that O
her O
husband O
might O
not O
care O
about O
thus O
exposing O
her O
to O
infection O
, O
but O
she O
really O
thought O
, O
for O
Edward's S-PERSON
sake O
, O
it O
was O
her O
duty O
to O
take O
care O
of O
herself O
. O
It O
might O
be O
nothing O
to O
the O
colonel O
or O
Ellen S-PERSON
whether O
she O
lived O
or O
died O
, O
but O
to O
Edward S-PERSON
it O
was O
a O
great O
deal O
| | O
and O
so O
as O
she O
must O
choose O
between O
them O
, O
she O
would O
go O
with O
him O
who O
loved O
her O
best O
, O
and O
who O
would O
be O
miserable O
without O
her O
. O
The O
haughty O
, O
angry O
tone O
with O
which O
she O
spoke O
, O
the O
unjust O
taunt O
, O
roused O
every O
indignant O
feeling O
, O
and O
Colonel O
Fortescue S-PERSON
said O
more O
in O
that O
moment O
of O
irritation O
than O
he O
could O
have O
believed O
possible O
. O
But O
it O
only O
awakened O
the O
cold O
, O
sustaining O
pride O
which O
Eleanor S-PERSON
always O
called O
to O
her O
aid O
when O
conscience O
smote O
her O
, O
and O
she O
departed O
with O
her O
son O
, O
hardening O
every O
better O
feeling O
, O
and O
rousing O
anger O
against O
her O
husband O
and O
child O
to O
conquer O
the O
suffering O
of O
self O
- O
reproach O
. O
But O
when O
many O
miles O
from O
the O
city O
of O
death O
, O
and O
there O
were O
no O
fears O
for O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
anxiety O
and O
wretchedness O
so O
assailed O
her O
, O
that O
pride O
itself O
gave O
way O
. O
To O
communicate O
with O
the O
infected O
city O
was O
difficult O
, O
and O
very O
infrequent O
, O
and O
again O
and O
again O
did O
she O
wish O
that O
she O
had O
remained O
. O
During O
the O
continuance O
of O
Ellen's S-PERSON
illness O
her O
father's O
anguish O
was O
indeed O
terrible O
. O
Every O
leisure O
moment O
he O
spent O
by O
her O
side O
, O
moistening O
her O
parched O
lips O
, O
bathing O
her O
burning O
forehead O
, O
and O
listening O
to O
the O
plaintive O
accents O
of O
delirium O
with O
an O
acuteness O
of O
suffering O
, O
that O
injured O
his O
own O
health O
more O
than O
he O
had O
the O
least O
idea O
of O
. O
The O
attendants O
were O
really O
both O
kind O
and O
skillful O
, O
but O
the O
colonel O
fancied O
, O
when O
he O
was O
not O
with O
her O
, O
she O
was O
neglected O
, O
and O
in O
still O
greater O
suffering O
| | O
and O
the O
struggle O
between O
his O
duties O
and O
his O
child O
was O
almost O
more O
than O
he O
could O
bear O
. O
He O
had O
never O
been O
a O
religious O
man O
— O
never O
known O
what O
it O
was O
to O
pray O
, O
except O
in O
the O
public O
services O
of O
his O
regiment O
, O
but O
now O
prayer O
, O
earnest O
, O
heartfelt O
, O
poured O
from O
him O
, O
and O
the O
thankfulness O
to O
God O
, O
which O
so O
overpowered O
him O
, O
when O
she O
was O
pronounced O
out O
of O
danger O
, O
as O
to O
compel O
him O
to O
weep O
like O
a O
child O
, O
planted O
a O
sense O
of O
a O
Father's O
infinite O
love O
and O
infinite O
compassion O
within O
him O
, O
which O
was O
his O
sole O
sustainer O
the O
short O
remainder O
of O
his O
life O
. O
Eleanor's S-PERSON
letters O
, O
few O
as O
they O
were O
, O
had O
in O
some O
degree O
softened O
his O
anger O
toward O
her O
| | O
but O
as O
he O
beheld O
the O
ravages O
of O
disease O
on O
his O
poor O
child's O
face O
and O
form O
, O
rendering O
her O
still O
less O
attractive O
than O
she O
had O
been O
, O
and O
perceived O
that O
bodily O
weakness O
had O
extended O
to O
her O
mind O
, O
and O
often O
and O
often O
forced O
tears O
from O
her O
eyes O
and O
momentary O
complainings O
, O
he O
trembled O
lest O
Eleanor S-PERSON
should O
find O
still O
more O
to O
dislike O
and O
reprove O
| | O
and O
often O
his O
heart O
bled O
as O
Ellen S-PERSON
would O
ask O
with O
tears O
, O
for O
her O
dear O
mamma O
, O
adding O
, O
plaintively O
, O
" O
Mamma O
never O
kisses O
me O
or O
loves O
me O
as O
she O
does O
Edward S-PERSON
| | O
but O
I O
like O
to O
be O
near O
her O
, O
and O
look O
at O
her O
dear O
beautiful O
face O
, O
and O
wish O
I O
was O
good O
and O
pretty O
enough O
for O
her O
to O
love O
me O
. O
Why O
does O
she O
never O
come O
to O
me O
? O
— O
and O
why O
may O
I O
not O
go O
to O
her O
? O
" O
And O
what O
could O
the O
colonel O
reply O
, O
except O
that O
her O
mother O
feared O
Edward S-PERSON
would O
take O
the O
infection O
, O
and O
therefore O
she O
was O
obliged O
to O
go O
with O
him O
to O
some O
place O
of O
safety O
? O
And O
his O
child O
was O
satisfied O
, O
repeating O
so O
fondly O
her O
delight O
that O
her O
dear O
, O
dear O
Edward S-PERSON
had O
been O
saved O
from O
being O
as O
ill O
as O
she O
was O
, O
that O
her O
father O
clasped O
her O
closer O
and O
closer O
to O
his O
heart O
, O
feeling O
the O
intrinsic O
beauty O
of O
a O
disposition O
that O
, O
instead O
of O
repining O
that O
she O
was O
left O
alone O
to O
suffer O
, O
could O
rejoice O
that O
her O
brother O
had O
been O
spared O
. O
Colonel O
Fortescue S-PERSON
obtained O
a O
few O
weeks' O
leave O
, O
that O
he O
might O
take O
his O
child O
to O
the O
sea O
-side O
as O
recommended O
, O
ere O
she O
joined O
her O
mother O
. O
And O
alone O
with O
him O
, O
gradually O
regaining O
a O
moderate O
degree O
of O
strength O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
was O
very O
happy O
| | O
but O
such O
bright O
intervals O
were O
indeed O
few O
and O
far O
between O
. O
There O
was O
no O
change O
in O
her O
mother's O
conduct O
toward O
her O
, O
when O
reunited O
. O
Her O
heart O
had O
, O
indeed O
, O
risen O
to O
her O
lips O
as O
she O
again O
beheld O
the O
child O
so O
nearly O
lost O
| | O
and O
had O
she O
followed O
impulse O
, O
she O
would O
have O
clasped O
her O
in O
her O
arms O
and O
wept O
over O
her O
, O
but O
that O
would O
have O
seemed O
tacitly O
to O
acknowledge O
that O
she O
had O
been O
wrong O
, O
and O
had O
suffered O
from O
it O
| | O
and O
so O
she O
refrained O
, O
causing O
suffering O
to O
herself O
, O
anguish O
to O
her O
child O
, O
and O
pain O
to O
her O
husband O
, O
all O
from O
that O
fell O
demon O
, O
pride O
. O
She O
only O
chose O
to O
remember O
that O
it O
was O
Ellen S-PERSON
who O
had O
been O
the O
cause O
of O
her O
husband's O
anger O
— O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
the O
constant O
subject O
of O
contention O
between O
them O
— O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
always O
causing O
the O
pang O
of O
self O
- O
reproach O
: O
and O
so O
how O
was O
it O
possible O
that O
she O
could O
love O
her O
? O
About B-DATE
a I-DATE
year E-DATE
after O
Ellen's S-PERSON
dangerous O
illness O
, O
when O
she O
was O
nearly O
ten S-DATE
, O
and O
Edward S-PERSON
just O
eleven O
, O
Colonel O
Fortescue S-PERSON
was O
ordered O
to O
take O
command O
of O
some O
troops O
to O
be O
stationed O
at O
a O
fort O
, O
whose O
vicinity O
to O
some O
hostile O
natives O
rendered O
it O
rather O
a O
post O
of O
danger O
. O
The O
wives O
and O
children O
of O
the O
officers O
were O
permitted O
to O
accompany O
them O
, O
if O
they O
wished O
it O
, O
and O
, O
except O
in O
the O
colonel's O
own O
family O
, O
there O
had O
been O
no O
hesitation O
in O
their O
choice O
. O
The O
colonel O
was O
strangely O
and O
painfully O
depressed O
as O
with O
some O
vague O
dread O
, O
and O
all O
his O
affection O
for O
his O
wife O
had O
returned O
with O
such O
force O
as O
to O
make O
him O
shrink O
in O
unusual O
suffering O
from O
the O
idea O
of O
leaving O
her O
| | O
and O
conquering O
reluctance O
, O
for O
he O
felt O
as O
if O
she O
would O
not O
accede O
, O
he O
implored O
her O
to O
accompany O
him O
, O
confessing O
he O
felt O
ill O
and O
unhappy O
, O
and O
shrank O
from O
a O
separation O
. O
His O
wife O
looked O
at O
him O
with O
astonishment O
| | O
he O
had O
never O
asked O
nor O
thought O
of O
such O
a O
thing O
before O
, O
she O
said O
, O
in O
their O
many O
brief O
partings O
, O
and O
she O
really O
could O
not O
understand O
him O
. O
The O
place O
was O
decidedly O
unhealthy O
, O
and O
Edward S-PERSON
must O
not O
be O
exposed O
to O
its O
malaria O
| | O
besides O
which O
, O
she O
had O
promised O
him O
to O
go O
to O
a O
juvenile O
ball O
, O
which O
was O
given O
by O
an O
English S-LANGUAGE
family O
of O
rank O
, O
in O
a O
fortnight's O
time O
, O
and O
she O
could O
not O
possibly O
disappoint O
him O
| | O
and O
why O
her O
husband O
should O
wish O
for O
her O
in O
such O
a O
place O
she O
could O
not O
imagine O
, O
but O
she O
knew O
she O
should O
die O
of O
terror O
before O
she O
had O
been O
there O
a B-DATE
week E-DATE
. O
Not O
a O
word O
did O
the O
colonel O
utter O
in O
reply O
, O
but O
he O
felt O
as O
if O
an O
ice O
- O
bolt O
had O
struck O
his O
heart O
and O
frozen O
it O
at O
once O
. O
He O
fixed O
his O
eyes O
upon O
her O
, O
with O
a O
strange O
, O
sad O
, O
reproaching O
look O
, O
which O
haunted O
her O
till O
her O
death O
, O
and O
turning O
from O
her O
, O
sought O
the O
room O
where O
Ellen S-PERSON
was O
preparing O
her O
lessons O
for O
the O
joyful O
hour O
when O
he O
could O
attend O
to O
her O
. O
As O
she O
sprung O
toward O
him O
with O
a O
cry O
of O
glee O
, O
he O
clasped O
her O
to O
his O
bosom O
, O
without O
the O
power O
of O
uttering O
a O
sound O
, O
save O
a O
groan O
so O
deep O
and O
hollow O
, O
that O
the O
child's O
unusual O
glee O
was O
checked O
, O
and O
she O
clung O
to O
him O
in O
terror O
| | O
and O
when O
he O
could O
tell O
her O
that O
he O
was O
about O
to O
leave O
her O
, O
and O
for O
an O
indefinite O
time O
, O
her O
passionate O
grief O
seemed O
almost O
to O
comfort O
him O
, O
by O
its O
strong O
evidence O
of O
her O
childish O
love O
. O
" O
Let O
me O
go O
with O
you O
, O
papa O
, O
dear O
papa O
! O
oh O
! O
I O
will O
be O
so O
good O
— O
I O
will O
not O
give O
you O
any O
trouble O
, O
indeed O
, O
indeed O
I O
will O
not O
. O
Pray O
, O
pray O
, O
take O
me O
with O
you O
, O
dear O
, O
dear O
papa O
? O
" O
And O
she O
looked O
in O
his O
face O
so O
beseechingly O
, O
that O
the O
colonel O
had O
no O
strength O
to O
resist O
, O
and O
fondly O
kissing O
her O
, O
he O
promised O
that O
if O
Mrs. O
Cameron S-PERSON
would O
permit O
her O
to O
join O
her O
little O
family O
, O
she O
should O
go O
with O
him O
: O
and O
, O
to O
Ellen's S-PERSON
intense O
thankfulness O
, O
the O
permission O
was O
willingly O
accorded O
. O
Mrs. O
Fortescue S-PERSON
had O
indeed O
replied O
, O
when O
her O
husband O
briefly O
imparted O
his O
intention O
, O
that O
he O
certainly O
must O
intend O
Ellen S-PERSON
to O
be O
ill O
again O
, O
by O
exposing O
her O
to O
such O
an O
unhealthy O
climate O
| | O
and O
that O
if O
she O
were O
, O
he O
must O
not O
be O
angry O
if O
she O
refused O
to O
go O
and O
nurse O
her O
, O
as O
it O
would O
be O
all O
his O
weak O
indulgence O
, O
and O
no O
fault O
of O
hers O
. O
The O
colonel O
made O
no O
answer O
, O
and O
irritated O
beyond O
measure O
at O
his O
manner O
, O
Eleanor S-PERSON
parted O
from O
her O
husband O
in O
coldness O
and O
in O
pride O
. O
The O
fortnight O
passed O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Fortescue S-PERSON
felt O
as O
if O
her O
own O
youth O
were O
indeed O
renewed O
, O
the O
longings O
for O
universal O
admiration O
again O
her O
own O
| | O
but O
now O
it O
was O
only O
for O
her O
son O
, O
and O
her O
triumph O
was O
complete O
| | O
many O
and O
lovely O
were O
the O
youthful O
beings O
called O
together O
on O
that O
festive O
night O
, O
seeming O
as O
if O
England S-GPE
had O
concentrated O
her O
fairest O
and O
purest O
offspring O
in O
that O
far O
distant O
land O
| | O
but O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
and O
his O
still O
lovely O
mother O
, O
outshone O
them O
all O
. O
That O
she O
was O
herself O
admired O
as O
much O
, O
if O
not O
more O
, O
than O
she O
had O
ever O
been O
in O
her O
palmy O
days O
of O
triumph O
, O
Eleanor S-PERSON
scarcely O
knew O
| | O
her O
every O
feeling O
was O
centered O
in O
her O
boy O
, O
and O
consequently O
the O
supercilious O
haughtiness O
which O
had O
so O
often O
marred O
her O
beauty O
in O
former O
days O
was O
entirely O
laid O
aside O
, O
and O
maternal O
pride O
and O
pleasure O
gratified O
to O
the O
utmost O
, O
added O
a O
new O
charm O
to O
her O
every O
movement O
and O
every O
word O
. O
She O
heard O
the O
universal O
burst O
of O
admiration O
which O
greeted O
her O
, O
as O
to O
oblige O
Edward S-PERSON
she O
went O
through O
a O
quadrille O
with O
him O
, O
and O
never O
in O
her O
whole O
career O
had O
she O
felt O
so O
triumphant O
, O
so O
proud O
, O
so O
joyous O
. O
During O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
fortnight E-DATE
she O
had O
often O
been O
tormented O
by O
self O
- O
reproach O
, O
and O
her O
husband's O
look O
had O
disagreeably O
haunted O
her O
| | O
but O
this O
night O
not O
a O
fleeting O
thought O
of O
either O
the O
colonel O
or O
Ellen S-PERSON
entered O
her O
mind O
, O
and O
her O
pleasure O
was O
complete O
. O
Tired O
with O
dancing O
, O
and O
rather O
oppressed O
with O
the O
heat O
, O
Eleanor S-PERSON
quitted O
the O
crowded O
ball O
- O
room O
, O
and O
stood O
for O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes E-TIME
quite O
alone O
in O
a O
solitary O
part O
of O
the O
verandah O
, O
which O
, O
covered O
with O
lovely O
flowers O
, O
ran O
round O
the O
house O
. O
The O
music O
in O
the O
ball O
- O
room O
sounded O
in O
the O
distance O
as O
if O
borne O
by O
the O
night O
breeze O
in O
softened O
harmony O
over O
the O
distant O
hills O
. O
The O
moon O
was O
at O
the O
full O
, O
and O
lit O
up O
nearly O
the O
whole O
garden O
with O
the O
refulgence O
of O
a O
milder O
day O
. O
At O
that O
moment O
a O
cold O
chill O
crept O
over O
the O
heart O
and O
frame O
of O
Eleanor S-PERSON
, O
causing O
her O
breath O
to O
come O
thick O
and O
gaspingly O
. O
Why O
, O
she O
knew O
not O
, O
for O
there O
was O
nothing O
visible O
to O
cause O
it O
, O
save O
that O
, O
in O
one S-CARDINAL
part O
of O
the O
garden O
, O
a O
cluster O
of O
dark O
shrubs O
, O
only O
partly O
illuminated O
by O
the O
rays O
of O
the O
moon O
, O
seemed O
suddenly O
to O
have O
assumed O
the O
shape O
of O
a O
funeral O
bier O
, O
covered O
with O
a O
military O
pall O
. O
At O
the O
same O
moment O
the O
music O
in O
the O
ball O
- O
room O
seemed O
changed O
to O
the O
low O
wailing O
plaint O
and O
muffled O
drums O
, O
the O
military O
homage O
to O
some O
mighty O
dead O
. O
And O
if O
it O
were O
indeed O
but O
excited O
fancy O
, O
it O
had O
a O
strange O
effect O
, O
for O
Eleanor S-PERSON
fainted O
on O
the O
marble O
floor O
. O
That O
same O
afternoon O
Colonel O
Fortescue S-PERSON
, O
with O
some O
picked O
men O
, O
had O
set O
off O
to O
discover O
the O
track O
of O
some O
marauding O
natives O
, O
who O
for O
some B-DATE
days E-DATE
had O
been O
observed O
hovering O
about O
the O
neighborhood O
. O
Military O
ardor O
carried O
him O
farther O
than O
he O
intended O
, O
and O
it O
was O
nearly O
night O
, O
when O
entering O
a O
narrow O
defile O
, O
a O
large O
body O
of O
the O
enemy O
burst O
upon O
them O
, O
and O
a O
desperate O
contest O
ensued O
. O
The O
defile O
was O
so O
hemmed O
in O
with O
rock O
and O
mountain O
, O
that O
though O
not O
very O
distant O
from O
the O
fort O
, O
the O
noise O
of O
the O
engagement O
had O
not O
been O
distinguished O
. O
Captain O
Cameron S-PERSON
was O
quietly O
sitting O
with O
his O
wife O
and O
elder O
children O
, O
awaiting O
without O
any O
forebodings O
the O
return O
of O
the O
colonel O
. O
Though O
it O
was O
late O
, O
Ellen's S-PERSON
fears O
had O
been O
so O
visible O
, O
that O
Mrs. O
Cameron S-PERSON
could O
not O
send O
her O
to O
bed O
| | O
the O
child O
seemed O
so O
restless O
and O
uneasy O
that O
the O
captain O
had O
tried O
to O
laugh O
her O
out O
of O
her O
cowardice O
, O
as O
he O
called O
it O
, O
declaring O
that O
her O
father O
would O
disown O
her O
if O
she O
could O
not O
be O
more O
brave O
. O
Hasty S-PERSON
footsteps O
were O
at O
length O
heard O
approaching O
, O
and O
Ellen S-PERSON
started O
from O
her O
seat O
and O
sprung O
forward O
, O
as O
the O
door O
opened O
| | O
but O
it O
was O
not O
the O
colonel O
, O
only O
a O
sergeant O
, O
who O
had O
accompanied O
him O
, O
and O
whose O
face O
caused O
Captain O
Cameron S-PERSON
to O
exclaim O
, O
in O
alarm O
, O
" O
How O
now O
, O
Sergeant O
Allen S-PERSON
, O
returned O
, O
and O
alone O
| | O
what O
has O
chanced O
? O
" O
" O
The O
worst O
those O
brown O
devils O
could O
have O
done O
! O
" O
was O
the O
energetic O
reply O
. O
" O
We've O
beaten O
them O
, O
and O
we O
will O
beat O
them O
again O
, O
the O
villains O
! O
but O
that O
will O
not O
bring O
him O
back O
— O
captain O
— O
captain O
— O
the O
colonel's O
down O
! O
" O
The O
captain O
started O
from O
his O
chair O
, O
but O
before O
he O
could O
frame O
another O
word O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
had O
caught O
hold O
of O
the O
old O
man's O
arm O
, O
and O
wildly O
exclaimed O
, O
" O
Do O
you O
mean O
— O
do O
you O
mean O
, O
pray O
tell O
me O
, O
Sergeant O
Allen S-PERSON
! O
— O
Have O
the O
natives O
met O
papa's O
troop O
, O
and O
have O
they O
fought O
? O
— O
and O
— O
is O
he O
hurt O
— O
is O
he O
killed O
? O
" O
The O
man O
could O
not O
answer O
her O
— O
for O
her O
look O
and O
tone O
, O
he O
afterward O
declared O
to O
his O
comrades O
, O
went O
through O
his O
heart O
, O
just O
for O
all O
the O
world O
like O
a O
saber O
cut O
| | O
and O
for O
the O
moment O
neither O
Captain O
nor O
Mrs. O
Cameron S-PERSON
could O
address O
her O
. O
The O
shock O
seemed O
to O
have O
banished O
voice O
from O
all O
, O
save O
from O
the O
poor O
child O
principally O
concerned O
. O
" O
Stay O
with O
me O
, O
my O
dear O
Ellen S-PERSON
! O
" O
Mrs. O
Cameron S-PERSON
at O
length O
said O
, O
advancing O
to O
her O
, O
as O
she O
stood O
still O
clinging O
to O
the O
sergeant's O
arm O
: O
" O
the O
captain O
will O
go O
and O
meet O
your O
father O
, O
and O
if O
he O
be O
wounded O
, O
we O
will O
nurse O
him O
together O
, O
dearest O
! O
Stay O
with O
me O
. O
" O
" O
No O
, O
no O
, O
no O
! O
" O
was O
the O
agonized O
reply O
| | O
" O
let O
me O
go O
to O
him O
, O
he O
may O
die O
before O
they O
bring O
him O
here O
, O
and O
I O
shall O
never O
feel O
his O
kiss O
or O
hear O
him O
bless O
me O
again O
. O
He O
told O
me O
he O
should O
fall O
in O
battle O
— O
oh O
! O
Mrs. O
Cameron S-PERSON
, O
pray O
let O
me O
go O
to O
him O
? O
" O
And O
they O
who O
knew O
all O
which O
that O
father O
was O
to O
his O
poor O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
could O
not O
resist O
that O
appeal O
. O
The O
sergeant O
said O
the O
colonel O
was O
not O
dead O
, O
but O
so O
mortally O
wounded O
they O
feared O
to O
move O
him O
. O
It O
was O
a O
fearful O
scene O
. O
Death O
in O
its O
most O
horrid O
form O
was O
all O
around O
her O
| | O
her O
little O
feet O
were O
literally O
deluged O
in O
blood O
, O
and O
she O
frequently O
stumbled O
over O
the O
dusky O
forms O
and O
mangled O
and O
severed O
limbs O
that O
lay O
on O
the O
grass O
, O
but O
neither O
sob O
nor O
cry O
escaped O
her O
till O
she O
beheld O
her O
father O
. O
His O
men O
had O
removed O
him O
from O
the O
immediate O
scene O
of O
slaughter O
, O
and O
tried O
to O
form O
a O
rough O
pallet O
of O
military O
cloaks O
, O
but O
the O
ghastly O
countenance O
, O
which O
the O
moon's O
light O
rendered O
still O
more O
fixed O
and O
pallid O
, O
the O
rigidity O
of O
his O
limbs O
, O
all O
seemed O
to O
denote O
they O
had O
indeed O
arrived O
too O
late O
, O
and O
that O
terrible O
stillness O
was O
broken O
by O
the O
convulsed O
and O
passionate O
sobs O
of O
the O
poor O
child O
, O
who O
, O
flinging O
herself O
beside O
him O
, O
besought O
him O
only O
to O
open O
his O
eyes O
, O
to O
look O
upon O
her O
once O
more O
, O
to O
call O
her O
his O
darling O
, O
and O
kiss O
her O
once O
, O
only O
once O
again O
: O
and O
it O
seemed O
as O
if O
her O
voice O
had O
indeed O
power O
to O
recall O
the O
fluttering O
soul O
. O
The O
heavy O
eyes O
did O
unclose O
, O
the O
clenched O
hand O
relaxed O
to O
try O
and O
clasp O
his O
child O
, O
and O
he O
murmured O
feebly O
— O
" O
How O
came O
you O
here O
, O
my O
poor O
darling O
Ellen S-PERSON
? O
are O
friends O
here O
? O
— O
is O
that O
Cameron's O
voice O
? O
" O
The O
captain O
knelt O
down O
by O
him O
and O
convulsively O
pressed O
his O
hand O
, O
but O
he O
could O
not O
speak O
. O
" O
God O
bless O
you O
, O
Cameron S-PERSON
! O
Take O
my O
poor O
child O
to O
her O
mother O
— O
implore O
her O
— O
to O
— O
and O
it O
is O
to O
- O
night O
, O
this O
very O
night O
— O
she O
and O
my O
boy O
are O
happy O
— O
and O
I O
— O
and O
my O
poor O
Ellen S-PERSON
— O
" O
A O
fearful O
convulsion O
choked O
his O
voice O
, O
but O
after O
a O
little O
while O
he O
tried O
to O
speak O
again O
— O
" O
My O
poor O
child O
, O
I O
have O
prepared O
you O
for O
this O
| | O
but O
I O
know O
you O
must O
grieve O
for O
me O
. O
Take O
my O
blessing O
to O
your O
brother O
, O
tell O
him O
to O
protect O
— O
love O
your O
mother O
, O
darling O
! O
she O
must O
love O
you O
at O
last O
— O
a O
ring O
— O
my O
left O
hand O
— O
take O
it O
to O
her O
— O
oh O
! O
how O
I O
have O
loved O
her O
— O
God O
have O
mercy O
on O
her O
— O
on O
my O
poor O
children O
! O
" O
He O
tried O
to O
press O
his O
lips O
again O
on O
Ellen's S-PERSON
cheek O
and O
brow O
, O
but O
the O
effort O
was O
vain O
— O
and O
at O
the O
very O
moment O
Mrs. O
Fortescue S-PERSON
had O
stood O
transfixed O
by O
some O
unknown O
terror O
, O
her O
husband O
ceased O
to O
breathe O
. O
It O
was O
long O
before O
Ellen S-PERSON
rallied O
from O
that O
terrible O
scene O
. O
Even O
when O
the O
fever O
which O
followed O
subsided O
, O
and O
she O
had O
been O
taken O
, O
apparently O
perfectly O
restored O
to O
health O
, O
once O
more O
to O
her O
mother O
and O
brother O
, O
its O
recollection O
so O
haunted O
her O
, O
that O
her O
many O
lonely O
hours O
became O
fraught O
with O
intense O
suffering O
. O
Her O
imagination O
, O
already O
only O
too O
morbid O
, O
dwelt O
again O
and O
again O
upon O
the O
minutest O
particular O
of O
that O
field O
of O
horror O
| | O
not O
only O
her O
father O
, O
but O
the O
objects O
which O
, O
when O
her O
whole O
heart O
was O
wrapped O
in O
him O
, O
she O
seemed O
not O
even O
to O
have O
seen O
. O
The O
ghastly O
heaps O
of O
dead O
, O
the O
severed O
limbs O
, O
the O
mangled O
trunks O
, O
the O
gleaming O
faces O
all O
fixed O
in O
the O
distorted O
expressions O
with O
which O
they O
died O
— O
the O
very O
hollow O
groans O
and O
louder O
cry O
of O
pain O
which O
, O
as O
she O
passed O
through O
the O
field O
, O
had O
fallen O
on O
her O
ear O
unheeded O
, O
returned O
to O
the O
poor O
child's O
too O
early O
awakened O
fancy O
so O
vividly O
, O
that O
often O
and O
often O
it O
was O
only O
a O
powerful O
though O
almost O
unconscious O
effort O
that O
prevented O
the O
scream O
of O
fear O
. O
Her O
father's O
last O
words O
were O
never O
forgotten O
| | O
she O
would O
not O
only O
continue O
to O
love O
her O
mother O
because O
he O
had O
desired O
her O
to O
do O
so O
, O
but O
because O
he O
had O
so O
loved O
her O
, O
and O
on O
her O
first S-ORDINAL
return O
home O
this O
seemed O
easier O
than O
ever O
to O
accomplish O
. O
Mrs. O
Fortescue S-PERSON
, O
tortured O
by O
remorse O
and O
grief O
, O
had O
somewhat O
softened O
toward O
the O
child O
who O
had O
received O
the O
last O
breath O
of O
her O
husband O
| | O
and O
could O
Ellen S-PERSON
have O
overcome O
the O
reserve O
and O
fear O
which O
so O
many O
years O
of O
estrangement O
had O
engendered O
, O
and O
given O
vent O
to O
the O
warmth O
of O
her O
nature O
, O
Mrs. O
Fortescue S-PERSON
might O
have O
learned O
to O
know O
, O
and O
knowing O
, O
to O
love O
her O
— O
but O
it O
was O
then O
too O
late O
. O
So O
torturing O
were O
Mrs. O
Fortescue's S-PERSON
feelings O
when O
she O
recalled O
the O
last O
request O
of O
her O
husband O
, O
and O
her O
cruel O
and O
haughty O
refusal O
| | O
when O
that O
which O
had O
seemed O
so O
important O
, O
a O
juvenile O
ball O
— O
because O
not O
to O
go O
would O
disappoint O
Edward S-PERSON
— O
became O
associated O
with O
his O
fearful O
death O
, O
and O
sunk O
into O
worse O
than O
nothing O
— O
she O
had O
parted O
with O
him O
in O
anger O
, O
and O
it O
proved O
forever O
| | O
— O
that O
even O
as O
England S-GPE
had O
become O
odious O
to O
her O
, O
twelve B-DATE
years I-DATE
before E-DATE
, O
so O
did O
India S-GPE
now O
| | O
and O
she O
suddenly O
resolved O
to O
quit O
it O
, O
and O
return O
to O
the O
relatives O
she O
had O
neglected O
so O
long O
, O
but O
toward O
whom O
she O
now O
yearned O
more O
than O
ever O
. O
She O
thought O
and O
believed O
such O
a O
complete O
change O
would O
and O
must O
bring O
peace O

Alas O

what O

the O

remorse O
? O
Though O
incapable O
of O
real O
love O
, O
from O
her O
studied O
heartlessness O
, O
it O
was O
impossible O
for O
her O
to O
have O
lived O
twelve B-DATE
years E-DATE
with O
one O
so O
indulgent O

fond O
as O
Colonel O
Fortescue S-PERSON
, O
without O
realizing O
some O
degree O
of O
affection O
, O
and O
his O
unexpected O
and O
awful O
death O
roused O
every O
previously O
dormant O
feeling O
so O
powerfully O
, O
that O
she O
was O
astonished O
at O
herself O
, O
and O
in O
her O
misery O
believed O
that O
the O
feeling O
had O
only O
come O

to O
add O
to O
her O
burden O
— O
for O
what O
was O
the O
use O
of O
loving O
now O
? O
and O
determined O
to O
rouse O
herself O
, O
she O
made O
every O
preparation O
for O
immediate O
departure O
, O
but O
she O
was O
painfully O
arrested O
. O
The O
selfish O
mother O
had O
fled O
from O
the O
couch O
of O
her O
suffering O
child O
, O
and O
now O
a O
variation O
of O
the O
same O
complaint O
laid O
her O
on O
a O
bed O
of O
pain O
. O
It O
was O
a O
desperate O
struggle O
between O
life O
and O
death O

but O
she O
rallied O
, O
and O
insisted O
on O
taking O
her O
passage O
for O
England S-GPE
some B-DATE
weeks E-DATE
before O
her O
medical O
attendant O
thought O
it O
advisable O
. O
The O
constant O
struggle O
between O
the O
whisperings O
of O
good O
and O
the O
dominion O
of O
evil O
, O
which O
her O
whole O
life O
had O
been O
, O
had O
unconsciously O
undermined O
a O
constitution O
naturally O
good O

and O
when O
to O
this O
was O
added O
a O
malignant O
disease O
, O
though O
brief O
in O
itself O
, O
the O
seeds O
of O
a O
mortal O
complaint O
were O
planted O
, O
which O
, O
ere O
the O
long O
voyage O
was O
concluded O
, O
had O
obtained O
fatal O
and O
irremediable O
ascendency O
, O
and O
occasioned O
those O
sufferings O
and O
death O
which O
in O
our O
first S-ORDINAL
chapters O
we O
described O
. O
To O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
though O
the O
death O
of O
his O
father O
had O
caused O
him O
much O
childish O
grief O
, O
still O
more O
perhaps O
from O
sympathy O
with O
the O
deep O
suffering O
of O
his O
mother O
, O
than O
a O
perfect O
consciousness O
of O
his O
own O
heavy O
loss O
, O
the O
manner O
in O
which O
he O
died O
was O
to O
him O
a O
source O
of O
actual O
pride O
. O
He O
had O
always O
loved O
the O
histories O
of O
heroes O
, O
military O
and O
naval O
, O
and O
gloried O
in O
the O
idea O
that O
his O
father O
had O
been O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
them O
, O
and O
died O
as O
they O
did O
, O
bravely O
fighting O
against O
superior O
numbers O
, O
and O
in O
the O
moment O
of O
a O
glorious O
victory O
. O
He O
had O
never O
seen O
death O
, O
and O
imagined O
not O
all O
the O
attendant O
horrors O
of O
such O
a O
one O
| | O
and O
how O
that O
Ellen S-PERSON
could O
never O
even O
hear O
the O
word O
without O
shuddering O
he O
could O
not O
understand O
, O
nor O
why O
she O
should O
always O
so O
painfully O
shrink O
from O
the O
remotest O
reference O
to O
that O
night O
, O
which O
was O
only O
associated O
in O
his O
mind O
with O
emotions O
of O
pleasure O

) O
, O
the O
character O
of O
Edward S-PERSON
shone O
forth O
in O
such O
noble O
coloring O
as O
almost O
to O
excuse O
his O
mother's O
idolatry O
, O
and O
win O
for O
him O
the O
regard O
of O
passengers O
and O
crew O
. O
Captain O
Cameron S-PERSON
had O
impressed O
on O
his O
mind O
that O
he O
now O
stood O
in O
his O
father's O
place O
to O
his O
mother O
and O
sister O
| | O
and O
as O
the O
idea O
of O
protecting O
is O
always O
a O
strong O
incentive O
to O
manliness O
in O
a O
boy O
, O
however O
youthful O
, O
Edward S-PERSON
well O
redeemed O
the O
charge O
, O
so O
devoting O
himself O
not O
only O
to O
his O
mother O
, O
but O
to O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
that O
her O
affection O
for O
him O
redoubled O
, O
as O
did O
her O
mistaken O
idea O
of O
his O
vast O
superiority O
. O
His O
taste O
had O
always O
pointed O
to O
the O
naval O
in O
preference O
to O
the O
military O
profession O
, O
and O
the O
voyage O
confirmed O
it O
. O
Before O
he O
had O
been O
a O
month O
on O
board O
he O
had O
become O
practically O
an O
expert O
sailor O
— O
had O
learned O
all O
the O
technical O
names O
of O
the O
various O
parts O
of O
a O
ship O
, O
and O
evinced O
the O
most O
eager O
desire O
for O
the O
acquirement O
of O
navigation O
. O
Nor O
did O
he O
fail O
in O
the O
true O
sailor O
spirit O
, O
when O
, O
almost O
within O
sight O
of O
England S-GPE
, O
a O
tremendous O
storm O
arose O
, O
reducing O
the O
vessel O
almost O
to O
a O
wreck O
, O
carrying O
her O
far O
from O
her O
destined O
moorings O
, O
and O
compelling O
her O
, O
after O
ten B-DATE
days' E-DATE
doubt O
whether O
or O
not O
she O
would O
reach O
land O
in O
safety O

to O
anchor O
in O
Milford B-GPE
Haven E-GPE
, O
there O
to O
repair O
her O
injuries O

she O
could O
be O
again O
seaworthy O
. O
The O
passengers O
here O
left O
her O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Fortescue S-PERSON
, O
whose O
illness O
the O
terrors O
of O
the O
storm O
had O
most O
alarmingly O
increased O
, O
was O
conveyed O
to O
Pembroke S-GPE
in O
an O
almost O
exhausted O
state O
| | O
but O
once O
on O
land O
she O
rallied O
, O
resolved O
on O
instantly O
proceeding O
to O
Swansea S-GPE
, O
then O
cross O
to O
Devonshire S-GPE
, O
and O
travel O
direct O
to O
Oakwood S-GPE
, O
where O
she O
had O
no O
doubt O
her O
sister O
was O
. O
But O
her O
temper O
was O
destined O
to O
be O
tried O
still O
more O
. O
The O
servant O
who O
had O
accompanied O
her O
from O
India S-GPE
, O
an O
Englishwoman S-NORP
, O
tired O
out O
with O
the O
fretful O
impatience O
of O
Mrs. O
Fortescue S-PERSON
during O
the O
voyage O
, O
and O
disappointed O
that O
she O
did O
not O
at O
once O
proceed O
to O
London S-GPE
, O
demanded O
her O
instant O
discharge O
, O
as O
she O
could O
not O
stay O
any O
longer O
from O
her O
friends O
. O
The O
visible O
illness O
of O
her O
mistress O
might O
have O
spared O
this O
unfeeling O
act O
, O
but O
Eleanor S-PERSON
had O
never O
shown O
feeling O
or O
kindness O
to O
her O
inferiors O
, O
and O
therefore O
, O
perhaps O
, O
had O
no O
right O
to O
expect O
them O
. O
Her O
suppressed O
anger O
and O
annoyance O
so O
increased O
physical O
suffering O
, O
that O
had O
it O
not O
been O
for O
her O
children O
she O
must O
have O
sunk O
at O
once O
| | O
but O
for O
their O
sakes O
she O
struggled O
with O
that O
deadly O
exhaustion O
, O
and O
set O
off O
the O
very O
next O
morning O
, O
without O
any O
attendant O
, O
for O
Swansea S-GPE
. O
They O
were O
not O
above O
thirty B-QUANTITY
miles E-QUANTITY
from O
this O
town O
when O
, O
despite O
her O
every O
effort O
, O
Mrs. O
Fortescue S-PERSON
became O
too O
ill O
to O
proceed O
. O
There O
was O
no O
appearance O
of O
a O
town O
or O
village O
, O
but O
the O
owners O
of O
a O

pitying O
the O
desolate O
condition O

to O
the O

never O

Mrs. O

such O
a O
blessed O
sensation O

as O
when O
the O
benevolent O
exertions O

Mr. O

had O
installed O
her O

and O
by O
means O
of O

relieved O
the O
torture O

aching O

she O
hoped O

September S-DATE

the O
room O
was O
sufficiently O
large O
, O
and O
the O
evenings O
sufficiently O
chill O

for O
a O
fire O
to O
add O
greatly O
to O
its O
aspect O

true O
English S-LANGUAGE

There O
were O
many O
admirable O
pictures O
suspended O
on O
the O

well O

stands O
of O
beautiful O
flowers O
, O
and O
some O
ingenious O
toys O
, O
all O
seeming O
to O
proclaim O
the O
apartment O
as O
the O
especial O
possession O
of O
the O
young O
party O
who O
were O
this O
evening O
busily O
engaged O
at O
the O
large O
round O
table O
which O
occupied O
the O
centre O
of O
the O
room O

They O
were O
only O
four S-CARDINAL
in O
number O
, O
but O
what O
with O
a O
large O
desk O
piled O
with O
books O
and O
some O
most O
alarming O
- O
sized O
dictionaries O
, O
which O
occupied O
the O
elder O
of O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
lads O

the O
embroidery O

of O
the O
elder O

the O
dissected O

before O
her O
sister O

and O
two S-CARDINAL
or O
three S-CARDINAL
books O
scattered O
round O
the O
younger O
boy O
, O
the O
table O
seemed O
so O
well O
filled O
that O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
had O
quietly O
ensconced O
herself O
in O
her O
own O
private O
little O
corner O
, O
sufficiently O
near O
to O
take O
an O
interest O
, O
and O
sometimes O
join O
in O
the O
conversation O
of O
her O
youthful O
charge O
| | O
but O
so O
apart O
as O
to O
be O
no O
restraint O
upon O
them O
, O
and O
to O
enable O
her O
to O
pursue O
her O
own O
occupations O
of O
either O
reading O
, O
writing O

working O
uninterruptedly O

Could O
poor O
Mrs. O
Fortescue S-PERSON
have O
glanced O
on O
the O
happy O
group O
, O
she O
certainly O
might O
have O
told O
her O
sister O
, O
with O
some O
show O
of O
justice O
, O
that O
there O
was O
such O
an O
equal O
distribution O
of O
interesting O
and O
animated O
expression O
( O
which O
is O
the O
great O
beauty O
of O
youth O
) O
, O
that O
she O
could O
not O
have O
known O
the O
trial O
of O
having O
such O
a O
heavy O
, O
dull O
, O
unhappy O
child O
as O
Ellen S-PERSON
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
indeed O
, O
we O
rather O
think O
, O
would O
not O
have O
considered O
such O
a O
trial O
, O
except O
as O
it O
proved O
ill O
- O
health O
and O
physical O
pain O
in O
the O
little O
sufferer O

and O
, O
perhaps O
her O
increased O
care O
and O
tenderness O
( O
for O
such O
with O
her O
would O
have O
been O
the O
consequence O
of O
the O
same O
cause O
which O
had O
created O
her O
sister's O
neglect O
) O
might O
have O
removed O
both O
the O
depression O
of O
constant O
but O
impalpable O
illness O
, O
and O
the O
expression O
of O
heaviness O
and O
gloom O
. O
Certain O
it O
is O
, O
that O
her O
own O
Herbert S-PERSON
had O
, O
with O
regard O
to O
delicate O
health O
, O
given O
her O
more O
real O
and O
constant O
anxiety O
than O
Eleanor S-PERSON

ever O
allowed O
herself O
to O
experience O

her O
dread O

indeed O

indolent O

such O

in O
those O

scarcely O

and O
that O
the O
vast O
difference O
in O

simply O
arose O
from O
the O
fact O

that O
the O

I O
will O

reasons O

Firstly S-ORDINAL
, O
wonder O
is O
the O
offspring O

has O
two S-CARDINAL
opposite O
effects O
on O
my O

on O
yours O
. O
With O
us O
it O
is O
closely O
connected O
with O
philosophy O
, O
for O
we O
are O
told O
in O
' O
wonder O
all O
philosophy O
begins O
, O
in O
wonder O
it O
ends O
, O
and O
adoration O
fills O
up O
the O
interspace O

' O
but O
with O
you O
, O
poor O
weak O
creatures O
, O
the O
only O
effect O
it O
produces O
is O
increased O
curiosity O
, O
of O
which O
you O
have O
naturally O
a O
more O
than O
adequate O
supply O
. O
Secondly S-ORDINAL
, O
if O
you O
begin O
to O
wonder O
and O
expect O
, O
and O
speculate O
as O
to O
the O
ayes O
and O
noes O
of O
a O
contingency O
to O
- O
night O

you O
will O
not O

talking O

mamma O

then O
good O

by O
to O
my O
theme O

for O
to O
write O
while O
your O
tongue O
is O
running O

is O
impossible O

pray O

take O
my O
advice O

on O
consideration O

you O
have O
had O
as O
good O
a O
sermon O

me O

my O
reverend O

do O

quite O
satisfied O

should O

into O
temptation O

was O
magnanimous O
enough O
not O
to O
mention O
her O
, O

to O
lay O
the O
whole O
blame O
of O
my O
non-appearance O

own O
disinclination O

that O
of O
nature O

Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
looked O
grave O

sorrowful O

to O
redeem O
my O
lost O
time O
in O
the O
morning O

was O

gently O

it O

enough O

that O

have O
to O

Percy S-PERSON

with O
regret O

him O
either O
from O
physical O
or O
mental O
suffering O

instinctively O
that O
, O
from O
his O
extraordinary O
mind O

vivid O
sense O
of O
duty O

was O
liable O
to O
the O
latter O

from O
many O
causes O
which O
other O
natures O
would O
pass O
unnoticed O

Miss O

not O
join O

that O
in O
their O
intercourse O

children O

as O
unrestrained O
as O
if O
they O
had O
been O
alone O

Had O
Caroline's S-PERSON
sentiments O
received O
encouragement O
, O
she O
would O
have O
interfered O

but O
the O
raillery O
of O
Percy S-PERSON
and O
the O
earnestness O
of O
Herbert S-PERSON
, O
she O
knew O
were O
more O
likely O
to O
produce O
an O
effect O
than O
any O
thing O
like O
a O
rebuke O
from O
herself O
, O
which O
would O
only O
have O
caused O
restraint O
before O
her O

future O
. O
It O
was O
through O
this O
perfect O
unrestraint O
that O
Mrs. O

had O
become O
so O

acquainted O
with O
the O
several O
characters O
of O
her O
children O

That O
Caroline's S-NORP
sentiments O
caused O
her O
often O
real O
pain O
was O
true O
, O

it O
was O
far O
better O
to O
know O
them O
, O
and O
endeavor O
to O
correct O
and O
remove O
them O
, O
by O
causing O
education O
to O
bear O
upon O
the O
faults O
they O
revealed O
, O

to O
find O
them O

the O
constant O
fear O

words O
of O
reproof O
. O

remove O
Herbert's S-PERSON
unusual O
seriousness O
, O
Percy S-PERSON

, O
laughingly O
— O

concerned O

party O

bring O
you O
the O
trouble O

" O
" O
I O
shall O
not O
regret O

only O
shall O
rejoice O
if O
I O
can O
in O
any O

lessen O
your O
mother's O

for O
what O
your O

will O
be O

I O
candidly O
tell O
you O

I O
have O
scarcely O

about O
it O

have O
no O
doubt O

shall O
find O
them O
strange O

shy O
at O
first S-ORDINAL

we O
must O
do O
all O
we O
can O

make O
them O
feel O

no O

now O

really O
Emmy O

not O

I O
am O
very O
sorry O

it O
will O
be O
capital O
if O
this O

out O

spirit O

mischief O

Herbert S-PERSON
, O
appealingly O
: O
" O
I O
feel O
it O
almost O
a O
mockery O

If O

reveal O
the O
confidence O

which O
Mr. O

Hamilton S-PERSON
were O
regarded O
by O

which O
by O
every O
one O
of O

party O
they O
were O
received O
, O
would O
have O
evinced O
it O
still O
more O
clearly O
. O
Herbert S-PERSON
was O
very O
speedily O
on O
his O
favorite O

a O
low O

Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
for O
that B-TIME
one I-TIME
half I-TIME
hour E-TIME
at O

, O
assumed O
her O
still O
unresigned O
privilege O

as O
the O
youngest O

tiniest O
, O
to O
quietly O
slip O
in O

Percy S-PERSON
was O
talking O
to O
his O
father O
, O
making O
Edward S-PERSON
perfectly O
at O
home O
, O
saying O
many O
kind O
words O
to O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
and O
caressing O
his O
mother O
, O
all O
almost O
at O
the O

moment O
. O
Caroline S-PERSON
was O
close O
to O
her O
father O
, O
with O
her O
arm O
round O
his O
neck O

Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
was O
kindly O
disrobing O
Ellen S-PERSON
from O
her O
many O
wraps O

making O
her O
lie O
quietly O
on O

, O
even O
in O
that O
moment O
of O
delightful O
reunion O
with O
her O
own O

had O
yet O
time O
and O
thought O
, O
by O
a O
few O
judicious O
words O
, O
to O
remove O
the O
undefinable O
, O
but O
painful O
sensation O
of O
loneliness O
, O
which O
was O
creeping O
over O
the O
poor O
child O
as O
she O
gazed O
on O
her O
bright O
, O
happy O

looking O
cousins O

thought O
if O
to O
her O
own O
mother O
Edward's S-PERSON
beauty O
and O
happiness O
had O
made O
him O
so O
much O
more O
beloved O
than O
herself O
, O
what O
claim O
could O
she O
have O
on O
her O
aunt O
? O
Ellen S-PERSON
could O
not O
have O
said O
that O
such O
were O
the O
thoughts O
that O
filled O
her O
eyes O
with O
tears O
, O
and O
made O
her O
heart O
so O
heavy O

she O
only O
knew O
that O
much O
as O
she O
had O
loved O
her O
aunt O
during O
the O
journey O
, O
her O
kiss O
and O
kind O
words O
at O
that O
moment O
made O
her O
love O
her O
more O
than O
ever O
. O
Never O
had O
there O
been O
a O
happier O
meal O

the O
substantial O
tea O
which O
was O
speedily O
ready O
for O
the O

So O
much O
was O
there O

all O
combined O

long O
before O

concluded O

to O
make O
Edward S-PERSON
feel O
perfectly O
at O

very O
happy O
, O
and O
greatly O
to O
remove O
Ellen's S-PERSON
unacknowledged O
dread O
. O
The O
time O
passed O
so O
quickly O
, O
that O
there O
was O
a O
general O
start O
when O
the O
prayer O
bell O
sounded O
, O
though O
it O
was O
nearly B-TIME
two I-TIME
hours E-TIME
after O
the O
usual O
time O
. O
" O
Are O
you O
prepared O
for O
to O
- O
night O
, O
my O
boy O
? O
" O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
asked O
of O
Herbert S-PERSON
, O
as O
they O
rose O
to O
adjourn O
to O
the O
library O
, O
where O
, O
morning O
and O
evening S-TIME
, O
it O
had O
been O
the O
custom O
of O
the O
Hamilton S-PERSON
family O
for O
many O
generations O
, O
to O
assemble O
their O
whole O
household O
for O
family O
devotion O
. O
" O
Yes O
, O
papa O

I O
was O
not O
quite O
sure O
whether O
you O
would O
arrive O

night O

" O
" O
Then O
I O
will O
not O
resume O
my O
office O
till O
to O
- O
morrow O
, O
Herbert S-PERSON
, O
that O
I O
may O
have O
the O
gratification O
of O
hearing O
you O
officiate O
, O
" O
replied O
his O
father O
, O
linking O
his O
son's O
arm O
in O
his O
, O
and O
affectionately O
glancing O
on O
the O
bright O
blush O
that O
rose O
to O
the O
boy's O
cheek O
. O
There O
was O
a O
peculiar O
sweetness O
in O
Herbert B-PERSON
Hamilton's E-PERSON
voice O
, O
even O
in O
speaking O
| | O
and O
as O
he O
read O
the O
service O
of O
the O
lessons O
for O
the O
evening O
, O
adding O
one S-CARDINAL
or O
two S-CARDINAL
brief O
explanations O
when O
necessary O
, O
and O
more O
especially O
when O
reading O
, O
or O
rather O
praying O
, O
the O
beautiful O
petitions O
appropriated O
to O
family O
worship O
, O
there O
was O
an O
earnest O
solemnity O
of O
tone O
and O
manner O
, O
presenting O
a O
strange O
contrast O
, O
yet O
beautiful O
, O
combining O
with O
the O
boyish O
form O
and O
youthful O
face O
, O
on O
which O
the O
lamp O
, O
suspended O
over O
the O
reading O
- O
desk O
shed O
such O
a O
soft O
and O
holy O
light O
. O
The O
occasional O
prayer O
which O
was O
added O
to O
the O
usual O
evening O
service O
, O
was O
always O
chosen O
by O
the O
reader O
| | O
and O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
were O
surprised O
and O
affected O
at O
the O
earnestness O
with O
which O
their O
almost O
angel O
boy O
selected O
and O
read O
over O
one S-CARDINAL
peculiarly O
bearing O
on O
the O
events O
of O
that O
evening O
| | O
the O
introduction O
of O
their O
orphan O
relatives O
, O
for O
compassion O
and O
blessing O
on O
them O
, O
and O
grace O
for O
increased O
kindness O
and O
forbearance O
in O
their O
intercourse O
with O
one O
another O
— O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
, O
his O
brother O
and O
sisters O
, O
knew O
well O
to O
what O
he O
alluded O
, O
and O
all O
but O
one O
responded O
with O
earnestness O
and O
truth O
. O
Caroline S-PERSON
could O
not O
enter O
into O
Herbert's S-PERSON
feelings O
even O
at O
that O
moment O
: O
it O
was O
a O
great O
effort O
to O
prevent O
a O
feeling O
of O
irritation O
, O
believing O
that O
he O
directly O
pointed O
at O
her O
, O
and O
determining O
that O
as O
neither O
he O
nor O
any O
one O
else O
had O
any O
right O
to O
interfere O
with O
her O
private O
thoughts O
, O
and O
that O
they O
could O
do O
harm O
to O
none O
while O
confined O
to O
her O
own O
breast O
, O
she O
resolved O
not O
to O
overcome O
them O
, O
and O
so O
could O
not O
join O
with O
any O
fervor O
in O
the O
prayer O
. O
To O
Edward S-PERSON
all O
was O
strange O
. O
While O
the O
graces O
of O
his O
body O
and O
mind O
had O
been O
most O
sedulously O
cultivated O
, O
he O
had O
never O
been O
taught O
even O
the O
public O
ordinances O
of O
religion O
, O
much O
less O
its O
inward O
spirit O
. O
His O
mother O
had O
often O
and O
often O
felt O
a O
pang O
of O
reproach O
, O
at O
thus O
neglecting O
that O
which O
an O
inward O
voice O
would O
whisper O
was O
most O
essential O
| | O
but O
she O
was O
wont O
to O
silence O
the O
pang O
by O
the O
determined O
idea O
, O
that O
she O
was O
neither O
worthy O
nor O
able O
to O
give O
him O
such O
solemn O
lessons O
, O
and O
that O
it O
would O
come O
by O
instinct O
to O
him O
in O
after O
years S-DATE
. O
There O
was O
time O
enough O
for O
him O
to O
think O
of O
such O
things O
. O
He O
had O
been O
now O
and O
then O
to O
church O
, O
but O
it O
was O
a O
mere O
form O
, O
regarded O
as O
a O
weary O
duty O
, O
from O
which O
he O
escaped O
whenever O
he O
could O
. O
The O
present O
scene O
, O
then O
, O
completely O
bewildered O
him O
. O
He O
had O
always O
fancied O
himself O
superior O
to O
any O
of O
the O
boys O
he O
had O
associated O
with O
| | O
but O
as O
he O
looked O
at O
and O
listened O
to O
Herbert S-PERSON
, O
who O
seemed O
at O
most O
only O
two B-DATE
years E-DATE
older O
than O
himself O
, O
he O
became O
sensible O
of O
a O
very O
strange O
and O
disagreeable O
, O
but O
a O
very O
decided O
feeling O
of O
inferiority O
: O
and O
then O
, O
too O
, O
it O
was O
so O
incomprehensible O
the O
servants O
all O
joining O
them O
, O
a O
class O
of O
people O
whom O
in O
India S-GPE
he O
had O
been O
taught O
so O
to O
consider O
his O
inferiors O
, O
that O
even O
to O
speak O
with O
them O
was O
a O
species O
of O
degradation O
| | O
and O
he O
was O
destined O
to O
be O
still O
more O
surprised O
, O
for O
before O
they O
left O
the O
library O
, O
he O
heard O
his O
aunt O
and O
uncle O
address O
them O
all O
, O
and O
say O
a O
few O
kind O
words O
, O
and O
make O
inquiries O
after O
their O
families O
to O
each O
. O
To O
Ellen S-PERSON
that O
evening O
service O
recalled O
some O
of O
Mr. O
Myrvin's S-PERSON
instructions O
, O
and O
seemed O
to O
help O
her O
to O
realize O
those O
new O
thoughts O
and O
feelings O
, O
which O
she O
had O
learned O
, O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
, O
in O
Wales S-GPE
. O
Her O
father O
had O
, O
indeed O
, O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
year E-DATE
of O
his O
life O
tried O
to O
give O
her O
some O
ideas O
of O
religion O
| | O
but O
having O
only O
so O
very O
lately O
begun O
to O
think O
seriously O
himself O
, O
he O
felt O
diffident O
and O
uncertain O
of O
his O
own O
powers O
, O
and O
so O
left O
an O
impression O
more O
of O
awe O
toward O
the O
subject O
than O
of O
love O
, O
which O
to O
a O
disposition O
such O
as O
Ellen's S-PERSON
was O
unfortunate O
. O
A O
very O
short O
time O
sufficed O
for O
Percy S-PERSON
and O
Emmeline S-PERSON
to O
introduce O
their O
cousins O
to O
all O
the O
delights O
and O
mysteries O
of O
their O
dear O
old O
home O
: O
and O
Oakwood B-FAC
Hall E-FAC
was O
really O
a O
place O
for O
imagination O
to O
revel O
in O
. O
It O
was O
a O
large O
castelated O
mansion O
, O
fraught O
with O
both O
the O
associations O
of O
the O
past O
, O
and O
the O
comforts O
of O
the O
present O

The O
injuries O
which O
the O
original O
mansion O
had O
received O
during O
the O
civil O
war O
of O
Charles B-PERSON
I. E-PERSON
, O
had O
, O
when O
the O
family O
returned O
at O
the O
Restoration S-FAC
, O
caused O
much O
of O
the O
old O
house O
to O
be O
pulled O
down O
, O
and O
replaced O
with O
larger O
rooms O
, O
and O
greater O
conveniences O
for O
a O
modern O
dwelling O
- O
house O
, O
retaining O
, O
however O
, O
quite O
sufficient O
of O
the O
past O
to O
throw O
interest O
around O
it O
. O
The O
wings O
were O
still O
flanked O
with O
turrets O
, O
which O
were O
Percy's O
and O
Emmeline's O
delight O

and O
the O
many O
stair O

cases O

leading O
into O
all O
sorts O
of O
nooks O
and O
corners O
— O
and O
the O
small O
and O
most O
uncomfortable O
rooms O
, O
because O
some O
of O
them O
happened O
to O
be O
hung O
with O
tapestry O
, O
and O
had O
those O
small O
narrow O
windows O
sunk O
in O
deep O
recesses O
— O
were O
pronounced O
by O
both O
far O
more O
enjoyable O
than O
the O
beautiful O
suite O
of O
rooms O
forming O
the O
center O
of O
the O
mansion O
, O
and O
the O
dwelling O
of O
the O
family O
. O
These O
were O
only O
saved O
from O
being O
disagreeably O
modern O
— O
Percy S-PERSON
would O
declare O
— O
by O
their O
beautiful O
richly O

polished O
oaken O
panels O
, O
and O
by O
the O
recesses O
which O
the O
large O
windows O
still O
formed O
, O
making O
almost O
a O
room O
by O
themselves O
. O
The O
hall O

too O
, O
with O
its O
superb O
sweep O

an O
actual O
dread O

such O

sources O

him O
neither O

He O
acted O

all O
things O
from O
the O
same O
single O
- O
hearted O
integrity O

high O
honor O

Mrs. O

interest O
from O

complete O
concentration O
in O
her O

as O
, O
in O
her O
first S-ORDINAL
retirement O
, O
many O
feared O

She O
had O
, O
too O
, O
some O
friends O
near O
her O

whose O
society O
gave O
her O
both O
pleasure O

many O
acquaintances O
who O
would O

more O

felt O
any O

the O

power O

quietly O
pursuing O
her O

path O

and O
yet O
conciliating O
all O
. O
The O
Rev. O
William B-PERSON
Howard E-PERSON
had O
accepted O
Mr. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
eagerly O
- O
proffered O
invitation O
to O
become O
his O
rector O
, O
and O
undertake O
the O
education O
of O
his O
boys O
, O
from O
very O
peculiar O
circumstances O
. O
He O
had O
been O
minister O
of O
a O
favorite O
church O
in O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
southern O
towns O
, O
and O
master O
of O
an O
establishment O
for O
youths O
of O
high O
rank O
, O
in O
both O
which O
capacities O
he O
had O
given O
universal O
satisfaction O
. O
The O
reprehensible O
conduct O
of O
some O
of O
his O
pupils O
, O
carried O
on O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
so O
secretly O
as O
to O
elude O
his O
knowledge O
, O
at O
length O
became O
so O
notorious O
as O
to O
demand O
examination O
. O
He O
had O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
refused O
all O
credence O
, O
but O
when O
proved O
, O
by O
the O
confused O
replies O
of O
all O
, O
and O
half O
confession O
of O
some O
, O
he O
briefly O
and O
emphatically O
laid O
before O
them O
the O
enormity O
of O
their O
conduct O
, O
and O
declared O
that O
, O
as O
confidence O
was O
entirely O
broken O
between O
them O
, O
he O
would O
resign O
the O
honor O
of O
their O
education O
, O
refusing O
to O
admit O
them O
any O
longer O
as O
members O
of O
his O
establishment O
. O
In O
vain O
the O
young O
men O
implored O
him O
to O
spare O
them O
the O
disgrace O
of O
such O
an O
expulsion O
| | O
he O
was O
inexorable O
. O
This O
conduct O
, O
in O
itself O
so O
upright O
, O
was O
painted O
by O
the O
smarting O
offenders O
in O
such O
colors O
, O
that O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
gradually O
but O
surely O
found O
his O
school O
abandoned O
, O
and O
himself O
so O
misrepresented O
, O
that O
a O
spirit O
less O
self O
- O
possessed O
and O
secure O
in O
its O
own O
integrity O
must O
have O
sunk O
beneath O
it O
. O
But O
he O
had O
some O
true O
friends O
, O
and O
none O
more O
active O
and O
earnest O
than O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
. O
A O
very O
brief O
residence O
at O
Oakwood B-FAC
Rectory E-FAC
removed O
even O
the O
recollection O
of O
the O
injustice O
he O
had O
experienced O
| | O
and O
he O
himself O
, O
as O
pastor O
and O
friend O
, O
proved O
a O
treasure O
to O
high O
and O
low O
. O
Ten S-CARDINAL
other O
youths O
, O
sons O
of O
the O
neighboring O
gentry O
, O
became O
his O
pupils O
, O
their O
fathers O
gladly O
following O
in O
Mr. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
lead O
. O
About B-QUANTITY
a I-QUANTITY
mile E-QUANTITY
and O
a O
half S-CARDINAL
across O
the O
park O
was O
Moorlands S-LOC
, O
the O
residence O
of O
Lady B-PERSON
Helen I-PERSON
Grahame E-PERSON
, O
whose O
name O
had O
been O
so O
often O
mentioned O
by O
the O
young O
Hamiltons S-PERSON
. O
Her O
husband O
Montrose B-PERSON
Grahame E-PERSON
, O
had O
been O
Arthur B-PERSON
Hamilton's E-PERSON
earliest O
friend O
, O
at O
home O
, O
at O
college O
, O
and O
in O
manhood O
. O
Lady O
Helen S-PERSON
the O
youngest O
daughter O
of O
a O
marquis O
, O
had O
been O
intimate O
with O
Emmeline S-PERSON
and O
Eleanor B-PERSON
Manvers E-PERSON
from O
childhood O
, O
and O
had O
always O
admired O
and O
wished O
to O
resemble O
the O
former O
, O
but O
always O
failed O
, O
she O
believed O
, O
from O
being O
constituted O
so O
differently O
| | O
others O
might O
have O
thought O
from O
her O
utter O
want O
of O
energy O
and O
mental O
strength O
. O
The O
marriage O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
appeared O
likely O
to O
be O
a O
happy O
one O
, O
but O
it O
was O
too O
soon O
proved O
the O
contrary O
. O
Grahame S-PERSON
was O
a O
man O
of O
strict O
, O
perhaps O
severe O
principles O
| | O
his O
wife O
, O
though O
she O
never O
did O
any O
thing O
morally O
wrong O
, O
scarcely O
knew O
the O
meaning O
of O
the O
word O
. O
Provoked O
with O
himself O
for O
his O
want O
of O
discrimination O
, O
in O
imagining O
Lady B-PERSON
Helen E-PERSON
so O
different O
to O
the O
being O
she O
really O
was O
| | O
more O
than O
once O
discovering O
she O
did O
not O
speak O
the O
exact O
truth O
, O
or O
act O
with O
the O
steady O
uprightness O
he O
demanded O
, O
his O
manner O
became O
almost O
austere O
| | O
and O
, O
in O
consequence O
, O
becoming O
more O
and O
more O
afraid O
of O
him O
, O
Lady B-PERSON
Helen E-PERSON
sunk O
lower O
and O
lower O
in O
his O
esteem O
. O
Two S-CARDINAL
girls O
and O
a O
boy O
were O
the O
fruits O
of O
this O
union O
. O
Lady O
Helen S-PERSON
had O
made O
a O
great O
many O
excellent O
resolutions O
with O
regard O
to O
their O
rearing O
and O
education O
, O
which O
she O
eagerly O
confided O
to O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
but O
when O
the O
time O
of O
trial O
came O
, O
weakness O
and O
false O
indulgence O
so O
predominated O
, O
that O
Grahame S-PERSON
, O
to O
counteract O
these O
evil O
influences O
, O
adopted O
a O
contrary O
extreme O
, O
and O
, O
by O
a O
system O
of O
constant O
reserve O
and O
severity O
, O
became O
an O
object O
of O
as O
much O
terror O
to O
his O
children O
as O
he O
was O
to O
his O
wife O
. O
But O
he O
did O
not O
pursue O
this O
conduct O
without O
pain O
, O
and O
never O
did O
he O
visit O
Oakwood S-GPE
without O
bitter O
regret O
that O
his O
home O
was O
not O
the O
same O
. O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
had O
often O
tried O
to O
alter O
the O
aspect O
of O
affairs O
at O
Moorlands S-LOC
| | O
the O
former O
, O
by O
entreating O
Grahame S-PERSON
to O
be O
less O
severe O
| | O
the O
latter O
, O
by O
urging O
Lady O
Helen S-PERSON
to O
a O
firmer O
mode O
of O
conduct O
. O
But O
those O
friendly O
efforts O
were O
as O
yet O
entirely O
useless O
. O
Grahame S-PERSON
became O
a O
member O
of O
Parliament S-ORG
, O
which O
took O
his O
family O
to O
London S-GPE
for O
five B-DATE
or I-DATE
six I-DATE
months E-DATE
in O
the O
year O
— O
a O
particularly O
agreeable O
change O
to O
Lady B-PERSON
Helen E-PERSON
, O
who O
then O
associated O
with O
her O
sisters O
, O
whose O
families O
were O
conducted O
much O
on O
the O
same O
fashion O
as O
her O
own O
, O
but O
unfortunately O
only O
increasing O
the O
discomfort O
of O
Moorlands S-LOC
when O
they O
returned O
to O
it O
. O
And O
this O
was O
the O
more O
to O
be O
regretted O
, O
from O
the O
fact O
that O
both O
Grahame S-PERSON
and O
his O
wife O
were O
full O
of O
good O
intentions O
, O
and O
had O
the O
one O
been O
more O
yielding O
, O
and O
the O
other O
more O
firm O
, O
there O
might O
have O
been O
no O
small O
share O
of O
happiness O
for O
both O
. O
But O
heavy O
as O
Lady B-PERSON
Helen E-PERSON
thought O
her O
trial O
in O
the O
want O
of O
her O
husband's O
confidence O
and O
love O
, O
and O
which O
she O
had O
greatly O
brought O
upon O
herself O
, O
it O
was O
light O
in O
comparison O
with O
that O
of O
Mrs. O
Greville S-PERSON
, O
another O
near O
neighbor O
and O
valued O
friend O
of O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
. O
She O
had O
loved O
and O
married O
a O
man O
whose O
winning O
manners O

appearance O
, O
and O
an O
ever O

varying O
flow O

Left O
at O

very O

his O
own O
master O

with O
a O
capital O
estate O
and O
large O
fortune O

educated O
at O
a O
very O
large O
public O
school O
, O
at O
which O
he O
learned O
literally O
nothing O
but O
vice O
, O
and O
how O
effectually O
to O
conceal O
it O
| | O
courted O
and O
flattered O
wherever O
he O
went O
, O
he O
became O
vain O
, O
overbearing O
, O
and O
extravagant O

with O
no O
pursuit O
but O
that O
of O
gambling O
in O
all O
its O
varieties O
, O
even O
hunting O

shooting O
could O
not O
be O
thoroughly O
enjoyed O
without O
some O
large O
bets O
depending O
on O
the O
day's O
sport O
: O
his O
thoughts O
from O
boyhood O
were O
so O
completely O
centered O
in O
self O
, O
that O
he O
had O
affection O
for O
nothing O

He O
had O
indeed O
fancied O
he O
loved O
Jessie B-PERSON
Summers E-PERSON
, O
when O
he O
had O
so O
successfully O
wooed O
her O

but O
the O
illusion O
was O
speedily O
dispelled O
, O
and O
repeatedly O
he O
cursed O
his O
folly O
for O
plaguing O
himself O
with O
a O
wife O
. O
His O
first S-ORDINAL
child O
, O
too O
, O
was O
a O
girl O

that O
annoyed O
him O
still O
more O

and O
when O
, O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
year E-DATE
, O
a O
boy O
was O
granted O
, O
he O
certainly O
rejoiced O
, O
but O
it O
was O
such O
rejoicing O
as O
to O
fill O
his O
wife's O
heart O
with O
an O
agony O
of O
dread O

for O
he O
swore O
he O
would O
make O
his O
boy O
as O
jovial O
a O
spirit O
as O
himself O
, O
and O
that O
her O
namby O
- O
pamby O
ideas O
should O
have O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
him O
. O
It O
was O
indeed O
a O
difficult O
and O
painful O
task O
Mrs. O
Greville S-PERSON
had O
to O
perform O
. O
Though O
her O
husband O
would O
spend O
weeks S-DATE
and O
even O
months S-DATE
at O
a O
time O
away O
, O
the O
impressions O
she O
so O
earnestly O
and O
prayerfully O
sought O
to O
instill O
into O
her O
son's O
heart O
were O
, O
or O
appeared O
to O
be O
, O
completely O
destroyed O
by O
her O
husband's O
interference O
the O
whole O
time O
of O
his O
sojourn O
at O
his O
home O
. O
It O
was O
his O
pleasure O
to O
thwart O
her O
every O
plan O
, O
laugh O
at O
her O
fine O
notions O
, O
make O
a O
mockery O
of O
all O
that O
was O
good O
, O
and O
holy O
, O
and O
self O
denying O
| | O
and O
all O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
his O
children O

succeeding O
in O
making O
Alfred S-PERSON
frequently O
guilty O
of O
disrespect O
and O
unkindness O
, O
but O
failing O
entirely O
with O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
who O
, O
though O
of O
such O
a O
fragile O
frame O
and O
gentle O
spirit O
that O
her O
father's O
visits O
almost O
always O
caused O
her O
a O
fit O
of O
illness O
, O
so O
idolized O
her O
suffering O
but O
never O
murmuring O
mother O
, O
that O
she O
only O
redoubled O
her O
attention O
and O
respect O
whenever O
she O
saw O
her O
more O
tried O
than O
usual O
. O
This O
conduct O
, O
of O
course O
, O
only O
made O
her O
an O
object O
, O
equally O
with O
her O
mother O
, O
of O
her O
father's O
sneers O
and O
taunts O
, O
but O
she O
bore O
it O
with O
the O
true O
spirit O
of O
a O
martyr O
. O
Suffering O
was O
doing O
for O
her O
what O
Herbert B-PERSON
Hamilton E-PERSON
was O
naturally O
— O
making O
her O
spiritual O
and O
thoughtful O
far O
beyond O
her O
years O
, O
and O
drawing O
her O
and O
Herbert S-PERSON
together O
with O
such O
a O
bond O
of O
mutual O
reverence O
and O
sympathy O
, O
that O
to O
talk O
to O
him O
was O
her O
greatest O
consolation O
, O
and O
to O
endeavor O
to O
lessen O
her O
sorrows O
one O
of O
his O
dearest O
pleasures O
. O
Alfred S-PERSON
was O
not O
naturally O
an O
evil O
- O
disposed O
boy O
, O
and O
when O
his O
father O
was O
from O
home O
seldom O
failed O
either O
in O
respect O
or O
obedience O
. O
Mrs. O
Greville S-PERSON
possessed O
the O
rather O
rare O
combination O
of O
extreme O
submissiveness O
with O
a O
natural O
dignity O
and O
firmness O
, O
which O
enabled O
her O
to O
retain O
the O
reverence O
and O
sympathy O
of O
her O
friends O
and O
her O
household O
, O
without O
once O
stooping O
to O
receive O
their O
pity O
. O
It O
was O
generally O
supposed O
by O
those O
who O
did O
not O
know O
her O
personally O
, O
that O
she O
was O
one O
of O
those O
too O
soft O
and O
self O
- O
denying O
characters O
who O
bring O
on O
themselves O
the O
evils O
they O
deplore O
| | O
but O
this O
in O
Mrs. O
Greville's S-PERSON
case O
was O
a O
very O
great O
mistake O
. O
It O
was O
impossible O
to O
associate O
even O
casually O
with O
her O
, O
without O
feeling O
intuitively O
that O
she O
suffered O
deeply O
, O
but O
the O
emotion O
such O
conviction O
called O
was O
respect O
alone O
. O
As O
anxious O
and O
as O
earnest O
a O
parent O
as O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
herself O
, O
Mrs. O
Greville S-PERSON
failed O
not O
to O
inculcate O
the O
good O
in O
both O
her O
children O
, O
and O
still O
more O
forcibly O
, O
when O
they O
became O
old O
enough O
to O
observe O
, O
by O
example O
than O
by O
precept O
. O
But O
with O
Alfred S-PERSON
there O
must O
have O
been O
an O
utter O
hopelessness O
as O
to O
the O
fruit O
of O
her O
anxious O
labors O
, O
had O
she O
not O
possessed O
that O
clinging O
, O
single O
- O
hearted O
trust O
which O
taught O
her O
that O
no O
difficulty O
should O
deter O
from O
a O
simple O
duty O
, O
and O
that O
nothing O
was O
too O
hard O
for O
Him O
who O
— O
if O
He O
saw O
that O
she O
shrunk O
not O
from O
the O
charge O
and O
responsibility O
which O
, O
in O
permitting O
her O
to O
become O
a O
mother O
, O
he O
had O
given O
, O
and O
did O
all O
she O
could O
to O
counteract O
those O
evil O
influences O
, O
for O
the O
removal O
of O
which O
she O
had O
no O
power O

root O
out O

the O
banishment O

she O
believed O

that O
to O
infuse O
the O
latter O
with O
the O
former O
would O
be O
their O
best O

the O
realization O

constant O

piety O

the O

taste O

not O
only O
in O
her O
girls O

beauty O

not O
in O
arts O

nature O
alone O

in O
character O

She O
did O
not O
allude O
to O
beauty O
of O
merely O
the O
high O
and O
striking O
kind O
, O

to O
the O
lowly O
virtues O
, O
struggles O
, O
faith O
, O
and O
heroism O
in O
the O
poor O
— O
their O
forbearance O

kindness O
to O
one O
another O
— O
marking O
something O
to O
admire O
, O
even O
in O
the O
most O
rugged O

surly O
, O
that O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
sight O
would O
seem O
so O
little O
worthy O
of O
notice O

It O
was O
gradually O

almost O

to O
accustom O
her O

to O
such O
a O
train O
of O
thought O

sentiment O
, O
that O
she O
so O
particularly O
laid O
aside O
one S-CARDINAL
part O
of O
the O
day O
to O
have O
them O
with O
her O
alone O

ostensibly O
, O
it O
was O
to O
give O
part O

the O
many O
poor O

to O
whom O
gifts O
of O
ready O

made O
clothing O
are O
sometimes O
much O
more O
valuable O

the O

more O

five S-CARDINAL
or O
six S-CARDINAL
, O
and O
that O
education O
, O
much O
as O
she O
loved O
and O
valued O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
, O
she O
had O
from O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
resolved O
should O
come O
from O
her O
alone O
. O
To O
Emmeline S-PERSON
this O
mode O
of O
life O
was O
so O
happy O
, O
she O
could O
not O
imagine O
any O
thing O
happier O
. O
But O
Caroline S-PERSON
often O
and O
often O
envied O
her O
great O
friend O
Annie B-PERSON
Grahame E-PERSON
, O
and O
believed O
that O
occasional O
visits O
to O
London S-GPE
would O
make O
her O
much O
happier O
than O
remaining O
all O
the O
year O
round O
at O
Oakwood S-GPE
, O
and O
only O
with O
her O
own O
family O
. O
She O
knew O
the O
expression O
of O
such O
sentiments O
would O
meet O
no O
sympathy O
at O
home O
, O
and O
certainly O
not O
obtain O
their O
gratification O
, O
so O
she O
tried O
to O
check O
them O
, O
except O
when O
in O
company O
with O
Annie S-PERSON
and O
Lady B-PERSON
Helen E-PERSON
| | O
but O
her O
mother O
knew O
them O
, O
and O
, O
from O
the O
discontent O
and O
unhappiness O
they O
so O
often O
engendered O
in O
her O
child O
, O
caused O
her O
both O
pain O
and O
uneasiness O
. O
But O
she O
did O
not O
waver O
in O
her O
plans O
, O
because O
only O
in O
Emmeline S-PERSON
they O
seemed O
to O
succeed O
: O
nor O
did O
she O
, O
as O
perhaps O
some O
over O
- O
scrupulous O
mothers O
would O
have O
done O
, O
check O
Caroline's S-PERSON
association O
with O
Miss O
Grahame S-PERSON
. O
She O
knew O
that O
those O
principles O
must O
be O
indeed O
of O
little O
worth O
, O
which O
could O
only O
actuate O
in O
retirement O
, O
and O
when O
free O
from O
temptation O
. O
That O
to O
prevent O
intimacy O
with O
all O
, O
except O
with O
those O
of O
whom O
she O
exactly O
approved O
, O
would O
be O
impossible O
, O
if O
she O
ever O
meant O
her O
daughters O
to O
enter O
the O
world O
| | O
and O
therefore O
she O
endeavored O
so O
to O
obtain O
their O
unrestrained O
confidence O
and O
affection O
, O
as O
to O
be O
regarded O
, O
both O
now O
and O
when O
they O
were O
young O
women O
, O
as O
their O
first S-ORDINAL
, O
best O
, O
and O
truest O
friend O
| | O
and O
that O
end O
obtained O
, O
intimacies O
with O
their O
young O
companions O
, O
however O
varied O
their O
character O
, O
she O
felt O
would O
do O
no O
permanent O
harm O
. O
" O
Dear O
, O
dear O
mamma O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
one O
morning O
about O
a O
week O
after O
her O
parents' O
return O
, O
and O
dropping O
her O
work O
to O
speak O
more O
eagerly O
, O
" O
you O
can O
not O
think O
how O
delightful O
it O
does O
seem O
to O
have O
you O
at O
home O
again O

I O
missed O
this O
hour O
of O
the O
day O
so O
very O
much O

I O
did O
not O
know O
how O
much O
I O
loved O
it O
when O
I O
always O
had O
it O
, O
but O
when O
you O
were O
away O
, O
every O
time O
the O
hour O
came O
I O
missed O
you O

longed O
for O
you O
so O
much O
that O
— O
I O
am O
afraid O
you O
will O
think O
me O
very O
silly O

not O
help O
crying O

" O
" O
Why O
, O
how O
Percy S-PERSON
must O
have O
laughed O
at O
you O
, O
Emmy O
! O
" O
" O
Indeed O
, O
he O
did O
not O
, O
mamma O

I O
think O
he O
felt O
half O
inclined O
to O
cry O
too O
, O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
day O
or O
two S-CARDINAL
that O
he O
came O
home O
from O
Mr. O
Howard's S-PERSON
, O
and O
could O
not O
rush O
up O
into O
your O
dressing O
- O
room O
, O
as O
he O
always O
does O

He O
said O
it O
was O
a O
very O
different O
thing O
for O
you O
to O
go O
from O
home O

than O
for O
him O
to O
go O
to O
London S-GPE

he O
did O
not O
like O
it O
at O
all O

Herbert S-PERSON

nor O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
neither O

they O
did O
not O

so O
much O
about O
it O

" O
" O
I O
did O
not O
miss O
mamma O
after O
the O
first S-ORDINAL

quite O
so O
much O
as O
you O
did O
, O
Emmeline S-PERSON

" O
replied O
her O
sister O

ingenuously O

when O
Lady B-PERSON

returned O
from O

she O
made O
me O
go O
there O
so O
often O

as O
I O
know O
you O
never O
refuse O
me O
that O
indulgence O

mamma O

Miss O

not O

glad O

so O

" O
" O
I O
have O
only O
one S-CARDINAL
objection O
my O
dear O

I O
think O
you O
know O
what O
that O
is O

That O
whenever O
I O
am O
with O
Annie S-PERSON

more O
about O

am O
afraid O
I O
do O

indeed O
I O
try O
to O
think O
that O
you O
must O
know O
what O
is O
better O
for O
me O
, O
and O
try O
not O
to O
be O
discontented O
, O
though O
sometimes O
I O
know O
I O
do O
not O
succeed O

her O
eyes O
filled O
with O
tears O

" O
I O
am O
satisfied O

endeavor O

trust O
my O
experience O

quite O
aware O
of O
all O
the O
difficulties O
you O
have O
to O
encounter O
in O
doing O
so O
, O
and O
therefore O
your O
most O
trifling O
conquest O
of O
self O
is O
a O
great O
source O
of O
comfort O
to O
me O
. O
I O
myself O
should O
feel O
that O
the O
pain O
of O
increased O
discontent O
, O
and O
so O
of O
course O
increased O
difficulty O
in O
conquering O
its O
constant O
accompaniment O
, O
ill O
temper O
, O
would O
more O
than O
balance O
the O
pleasure O
of O
Annie's S-NORP
society O
, O
and O
so O
not O
indulge O
in O
the O
one O
so O
often O
at O
the O
expense O
of O
the O
other O

but O
of O
that O
you O
are O
yourself O
the O
best O
judge O
, O
and O
you O
know O
in O
such O
a O
case O
I O
always O
permit O
you O
to O
be O
a O
free O
agent O
. O
But O
what O
has O
become O
of O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
Emmeline S-PERSON
? O
I O
begged O
Mrs. O
Greville S-PERSON
to O
let O
you O
be O
as O
much O
together O
as O
possible O
during O
my O
absence O

did O
not O
her O
society O
afford O
you O
some O
pleasure O

" O
" O
Oh O
, O
yes O
, O
mamma O
, O
a O
great O
deal O

but O
unfortunately O
Mr. O
Greville S-PERSON
was O
at O
home O
almost O
all O
the O
time O
you O
were O
away O
, O
and O
poor O
Mary S-PERSON
could O
not O
often O
leave O
her O
mother O
, O
and O
I O
don't O
feel O
as O
if O
it O
were O
quite O
right O
for O
me O
to O
go O
so O
often O
there O
, O
when O
he O
is O
at O
home O
. O
I O
am O
sure O
Mrs. O
Greville S-PERSON
and O
Mary S-PERSON
must O
both O
feel O
still O
more O
uncomfortable O
when O
any O
one O
is O
there O
to O
see O
how O
unkind O
he O
is O
, O
and O
hear O
the O
cruel O
things O
he O
says O
. O
Oh O
, O
how O
I O
do O
wish O
I O
could O
make O
poor O
Mary S-PERSON
more O
happy O
! O
" O
" O
She O
would O
tell O
you O
that O
affection O
is O
a O
great O
comfort O
to O
her O
, O
Emmy O
. O
" O
" O
Yours O
and O
Herbert's O
may O
be O
, O
mamma O
, O
because O
you O
are O
both O
so O
much O
better O
and O
wiser O
than O
I O
am O

I O
can O
do O
so O
little O
, O
so O
very O
little O
. O
" O
" O
You O
can O
be O

are O
a O
great O
source O
of O
interest O

her O

my O
dear O

when O
we O
wish O
very O
much O

make O
another O
person O
happy O

you O
may O
be O
quite O
sure O
that O
the O
most O
trifling O
act O
gives O
pleasure O

Ellen S-PERSON
looks O
very O
much O
as O
if O
she O
would O
like O
to O
know O
who O
this O
Mary S-PERSON
is O

that O
is O
so O
tried O
— O
suppose O
you O
tell O
her O

" O
Emmeline S-PERSON
eagerly O
obeyed O

painting O
her O
friend O
in O
such O
glowing O
colors O
, O
that O
Ellen S-PERSON
felt O
, O
however O
tried O
she O
might O
be O
, O
a O
person O
so O
good O
and O
holy O
must O
be O
happy O
, O
notwithstanding O

besides O
, O
to O
be O
loved O
so O
by O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
and O
Herbert S-PERSON
, O
discovered O
to O
her O
mind O
such O
superior O
qualities O
, O
that O
she O
almost O
wondered O
how O
Emmeline S-PERSON
could O
speak O
of O
her O
so O
familiarly O
, O
and O
think O
of O
her O
as O
her O
own O
particular O
friend O

But O
the O
conversation O
on O
her O
, O
and O
then O
on O
other O
topics O
, O
so O
interested O
her O
, O
that O
she O
was O
almost O
as O
sorry O
as O
her O
cousin O
, O
when O
it O
was O
interrupted O
by O
a O
visit O
from O
Lady B-PERSON
Helen I-PERSON

her O
daughter O

" O
Returned O
at O
length O
, O
dearest O
Emmeline S-PERSON

" O
was O
the O
former's O
lively O
greeting O

evincing O
far O
more O
warmth O

manner O

" O
Do O
you O
know O

the O
banks O
of O
the O
Dart S-ORG

seemed O
so O
desolate O
without O

very O
flowers O

hung O
their O
heads O

withered O

rather O

the O
change O

season O

not O

absence O

been O
the O

these O
melancholy O
facts O

replied O
Mrs. O

in O
the O
same O
tone O

must O
follow O
the O
example O
of O
my O
neighbors O

rich O

poor O

whom O
you O
may O
appeal O
to O
as O
to O
the O
fact O
of O
your O
absence O
causing O
terrible O
lamentation O

ask O
this O
naughty O
little O
girl O
too O

scarcely O
ever O
came O

me O

many O
things O

forgive O
me O

she O
added O

more O
seriously O

glanced O
on O
the O
deep O
mourning O

indeed O

we O
will O
talk O
of O
this O
another O
time O

Annie S-PERSON
, O
" O
she O
continued O
, O
addressing O
Miss O
Grahame S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
already O
deep O
in O
conversation O
with O
Caroline S-PERSON

" O
I O
have O
another O
little O
girl O
to O
introduce O

you O

you O

Emmeline S-PERSON

" O
The O
young O
lady O
turned O
round O
at O
the O
words O

her O
sole O
notice O
of O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
come O
timidly O
forward O
, O
was O
a O
haughty O
stare O
, O
a O
fashionable O
courtesy O
, O
and O
a O
few O
unintelligible O
words O
, O
which O
caused O
Emmeline S-PERSON
to O
feel O
so O
indignant O
, O
that O
it O
was O
with O
difficulty O
she O
kept O
silence O
, O
and O
made O
Ellen S-PERSON
so O
uncomfortable O

it O
was O
with O
even O
more O
than O
her O
usual O
shyness O

was O
Emmeline's S-PERSON

Annie S-PERSON

Caroline S-PERSON
turned O
in O
a O
different O

generally O
judging O

entirely O
to O
herself O

Edward S-PERSON

think O
I O
may O
like O
very O
much O

so O
affectionate O

so O
good O

natured O

as O
merry O

full O
of O
fun O

Percy S-PERSON

he O
is O
so O
handsome O

Annie S-PERSON

I O
think O
even O
you O
would O
admire O
him O

" O
" O
Then O
altogether O
he O
must O
be O
very O

never O
saw O
a O
girl O
so O
plain O

I O
am O
sure O
she O
looks O
as O

no O

could O
exist O
near O
her O

" O
" O
Mamma S-PERSON

we O
must O
remember O
how O
short O
a O
time O
has O
elapsed O

poor O
aunt's O
death O

also O
that O

not O

" O
" O

does O
not O
at O

nothing O

this O
only O
increased O
her O
intimacy O

determined O

gave O

Emmeline S-PERSON

so O
indignant O

felt O
more O

such O
little O

contemptuous O

wonder O

the O
tenor O
of O
her O
meditations O

Ellen S-PERSON

had O
caused O
her O
to O
shrink O
still O
more O

herself O

produced O
pain O

The O
whole O
of O
that O
hour's O
intimate O
association O
with O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON

puzzled O
her O

had O
doted O
on O
her O
father O

was O
sure O

loved O
her O
aunt O

she O
ever O
have O
given O
words O

Emmeline S-PERSON

done O

did O

so O
, O
perhaps O
, O
after O
all O

she O
did O
not O
feel O

Emmeline S-PERSON
and O
even O
Edward S-PERSON
did O
, O
that O
its O
very O
indulgence O
seemed O
to O
give O
her O
pain O
. O
Then O
Caroline's S-PERSON
confession O
too O
— O
could O
she O
ever O
have O
had O
courage O
to O
confess O
the O
indulgence O
of O
a O
feeling O
which O
she O
knew O
to O
be O
wrong O
— O
and O
all O
her O
aunt O
had O
said O
both O
to O
Caroline S-PERSON
and O
Emmeline S-PERSON
so O
fastened O
on O
her O
mind O
as O
to O
make O
her O
head O
ache O
, O
and O
she O
quite O
started O
when O
a O
loud O
shout O
sounded O
near O
them O
. O
" O
It O
is O
only O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
Emmeline S-PERSON
laughing O
| | O
" O
I O
dare O
say O
he O
and O
Edward S-PERSON
are O
running O
a O
race O
or O
having O
some O
sort O
of O
fun O
. O
" O
And O
so O
they O
were O

laughing O
, O
shouting O
, O
panting O
, O
they O
came O
full O
speed O
, O
darting O
in O
and O
out O
the O
trees O
in O
every O
variety O
of O
mathematical O
figures O
their O
ingenuity O
could O
frame O

but O
as O
soon O
as O
Percy's S-PERSON
restless O
eye O
discovered O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
he O
directed O
his O
course O
toward O
her O
, O
exclaiming O
, O
" O
Holla S-PERSON

Ellen S-PERSON
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
I O
have O
had O
such O
a O
happy O
day O

I O
like O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
more O
than O
ever O
( O

had O
only O
seen O
him O
twice O

I O
am O
sure O

shall O
get O
on O

him O

he O
will O
teach O
me O
astronomy O

shall O
not O

" O
" O

me O
walk O
home O
with O
you O

dear O

do O
tell O
me O
every O
thing O
you O
have O
done O
and O
are O
going O
to O
do O
, O
" O
asked O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
clinging O
to O
his O
arm O
, O
and O
looking O
in O
his O
face O
with O
such O
an O
expression O
that O
there O
was O
little O
trace O
of O
ill O
- O
temper O
. O
Emmeline S-PERSON
meanwhile O
had O
made O
her O
brother O
a O
party O
in O
her O
indignation O
against O
Annie's S-PERSON
pride O
, O
which O
he O
termed O
insolence O
, O
vowing O
he O
would O
make O
her O
feel O
it O
. O
And O
as O
they O
came O
in O
sight O
of O
her O
and O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
he O
called O
out O
to O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
who O
, O
all O
her O
timidity O
returning O
, O
tried O
to O
draw O
Edward S-PERSON
into O
another O
walk O
. O
" O
Not O
there O
, O
not O
there O
, O
Miss O
Nelly S-PERSON
, O
you O
are O
not O
going O
to O
cut O
me O
in O
that O
fashion O
. O
You O
have O
talked O
quite O
enough O
to O
Edward S-PERSON
and O
must O
now O
come O
to O
me O
. O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
there's O
mamma O

off O
with O
you O
to O
tell O
your O
tale O
of O
delight O
to O
her O
. O
" O
And O
Edward S-PERSON
did O
not O
wait O
a O
second S-ORDINAL
bidding O
, O
leaving O
Ellen S-PERSON
to O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
who O
threw O
his O
arm O
affectionately O
round O
her O
, O
and O
began O
talking O
to O
her O
so O
amusingly O
that O
she O
could O
not O
help O
laughing O
, O
and O
so O
devoted O
did O
he O
appear O
to O
her O
, O
that O
he O
had O
only O
time O
to O
greet O
Miss O
Grahame S-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
very O
marked O
and O
polite O
bow O
, O
and O
passed O
on O
. O
He O
wished O
to O
provoke O
, O
and O
he O
succeeded O
, O
for O
Annie S-PERSON
was O
always O
particularly O
pleased O
when O
the O
handsome O
, O
spirited O
Percy B-PERSON
Hamilton E-PERSON
paid O
her O
any O
attention O
, O
and O
that O
he O
should O
be O
so O
devoted O
to O
his O
little O
pale O
, O
disagreeable O
- O
looking O
cousin O
, O
as O
not O
even O
to O
give O
her O
a O
word O
, O
annoyed O
her O
as O
much O
as O
he O
desired O
. O
Edward's S-PERSON
hasty O
progress O
to O
his O
aunt O
was O
slightly O
checked O
at O
seeing O
a O
stranger O
with O
her O
, O
but O
when O
he O
was O
introduced O
he O
made O
his O
bow O
with O
so O
much O
of O
his O
mother's O
grace O
, O
that O
, O
combined O
with O
the O
extraordinary O
likeness O
, O
and O
her O
feelings O
already O
interested O
in O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
account O
of O
her O
sister's O
sufferings O
and O
death O
, O
Lady B-PERSON
Helen E-PERSON
could O
not O
for O
the O
moment O
speak O
except O
to O
exclaim O
, O
" O
Oh O
, O
how O
that O
look O
recalls O
the O
past O
! O
I O
could O
almost O
fancy O
poor O
Eleanor S-PERSON
herself O
stood O
before O
me O

" O
" O
Did O
you O
— O
did O
you O
know O
my O
mother O
madam O
? O
" O
said O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
with O
so O
much O
eagerness O
that O
his O
cheeks O
crimsoned O
and O
his O
voice O
trembled O
. O
— O
" O
Were O
you O
one O
of O
mamma's O
" O
— O
but O
he O
could O
not O
finish O
the O
sentence O
, O
and O
leaning O
his O
head O
against O
his O
aunt O
, O
he O
burst O
into O
tears O
. O
" O
Poor O
child O
! O
" O
said O
Lady B-PERSON
Helen E-PERSON
pityingly O
, O
as O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
pressed O
him O
closer O
to O
her O
, O
and O
stooped O
down O
to O
kiss O
his O
forehead O
without O
speaking O

and O
that O
sudden O
and O
unexpected O
display O
of O
feeling O
contrasted O
with O
Ellen's S-PERSON
painful O
shyness O

A B-DATE

days E-DATE
more O
brought O
Mrs. O
Greville S-PERSON
and O
Mary S-PERSON
to O
welcome O
their O
friends O
, O
and O
Ellen S-PERSON
had O
again O
the O
pain O
of O
being O
introduced O
to O
strangers O
| | O
but O
this O
time O
it O
was O
only O
the O
pain O
of O
her O
own O
shyness O
, O
for O
could O
she O
have O
overcome O
that O
feeling O
, O
she O
might O
have O
felt O
even O
pleasure O
. O
As O
it O
was O
, O
the O
gentle O
voice O
and O
manner O
with O
which O
Mrs. O
Greville S-PERSON
addressed O
her O
, O
and O
the O
timid O
yet O
expressive O
glance O
of O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
told O
of O
such O
sympathy O
and O
kindness O
, O
that O
she O
felt O
attracted O
toward O
both O
, O
and O
could O
quite O
enter O
into O
Emmeline's S-PERSON
enthusiastic O
admiration O
of O
her O
friend O
| | O
not O
, O
however O
, O
believing O
it O
possible O
that O
she O
herself O
could O
ever O
be O
worthy O
to O
win O
Mary's S-PERSON
regard O
. O
Taught O
from O
such O
a O
very O
early O
age O
to O
believe O
herself O
so O
far O
inferior O
to O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
such O
characters O
as O
Herbert S-PERSON
and O
Mary S-PERSON
appeared O
to O
her O
so O
exalted O
, O
that O
it O
was O
quite O
impossible O
they O
could O
ever O
think O
of O
her O
| | O
the O
constant O
little O
acts O
of O
unobtrusive O
kindness O
that O
her O
cousin O
showed O
her O
, O
she O
attributed O
to O
his O
extreme O
goodness O
, O
not O
from O
the O
most O
trifling O
merit O
in O
herself O
. O
She O
did O
indeed O
love O
him O
very O
dearly O
, O
the O
best O
next O
to O
her O
aunt O
| | O
but O
so O
much O
of O
reverence O
mingled O
with O
it O
, O
that O
she O
was O
almost O
more O
reserved O
with O
him O
than O
with O
the O
others O
. O
But O
Herbert S-PERSON
was O
naturally O
reserved O
himself O
in O
words O
, O
and O
so O
he O
did O
not O
think O
any O
thing O
about O
it O
, O
except O
to O
wish O
and O
endeavor O
to O
make O
his O
little O
cousin O
happier O
than O
she O
seemed O
. O
When O
contrasting O
Mary B-PERSON
Greville E-PERSON
with O
Annie B-PERSON
Grahame E-PERSON
, O
as O
she O
was O
rather O
fond O
of O
doing O
, O
Emmeline S-PERSON
became O
so O
afraid O
she O
was O
disliking O
the O
latter O
more O
than O
she O
ought O
to O
do O
, O
that O
she O
never O
rested O
till O
she O
made O
an O
opportunity O
to O
confess O
all O
her O
feelings O
to O
her O
mother O
, O
and O
beg O
her O
to O
tell O
her O
if O
they O
were O
very O
wrong O
, O
and O
if O
she O
ought O
to O
like O
her O
. O
" O
I O
am O
not O
so O
unconscionable O
as O
to O
expect O
you O
to O
like O
every O
one O
with O
whom O
you O
associate O
, O
my O
dear O
little O
girl O
, O
" O
replied O
her O
mother O
, O
fondly O
, O
for O
there O
was O
something O
in O
Emmeline's O
guileless O
confidence O
irresistibly O
claiming O
love O
. O
" O
All O
we O
have O
to O
do O
when O
we O
find O
nothing O
that O
exactly O
sympathizes O
with O
our O
own O
feelings O
, O
or O
our O
own O
ideas O
of O
right O
and O
wrong O
, O
is O
to O
try O
and O
find O
out O
some O
reason O
for O
their O
being O
so O
different O

some O
circumstance O
that O
may O
have O
exposed O
them O
to O
greater O
temptations O
and O
trials O
, O
for O
you O
know O
I O
have O
often O
told O
you O
pleasure O

amusements O

if O
too O
much O
indulged O
in O
, O
are O
a O
much O
greater O
trial O
to O
some O
than O
sorrow O
and O
pain O
. O
Now O
Annie S-PERSON
has O
had O
a O
great O
many O
more O
temptations O
of O
this O
kind O
than O
you O
or O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
and O
we O
can O
not O
expect O
one O
so O
very O
young O
entirely O
to O
resist O
them O
. O
" O
" O
Do O
you O
mean O
, O
mamma O
, O
her O
going O
out O
so O
much O
in O
London S-GPE

" O
" O
Yes O
, O
love O

she O
is O
very O
much O
noticed O

so O
perhaps O
thinks O
a O
little O
more O
of O
appearance O

dress O

pleasure O

is O
quite O
necessary O

out O

you O

quite O
right O

asked O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
very O
thoughtfully O

" O
We O
must O
never O
pronounce O
judgment O

I O
think O
it O
better O
not O

interrupt O
your O
present O

I O
hope O
happy O

therefore O
I O
do O
not O
take O
you O

Mr. O
Grahame S-PERSON

obliged O
to O
be O
there O
for O
several B-DATE
months E-DATE
, O
and O
Lady O
Helen S-PERSON
very O
naturally O
would O
not O
like O
to O
be O
separated O
either O
from O
him O

her O
children O

And O
then O
she O
has O
such O
a O
large O
family O

Annie S-PERSON
so O
many O
young O
relations O

that O
you O
see O
Lady B-PERSON
Helen E-PERSON
could O
not O
keep O
her O
children O
quite O
as O
free O
from O
temptation O

I O
do O
mine O

we O
should O
be O
more O
sorry O

blame O
her O
individually O

of O
you O
, O
my O
love O
. O
When O
I O
tell O
you O
that O
our O
Father O
in O
Heaven O
commands O
us O
to O
love O
one O
another O
, O
and O
to O
avoid O
all O
unkindness O
in O
thought O
and O
deed O
, O
I O
do O
not O
mean O
that O
He O
desires O
us O
to O
love O
all O
alike O
, O
because O
He O
knew O
it O
would O
be O
neither O
for O
our O
happiness O
nor O
good O
that O
it O
should O
be O
so O
, O
but O
only O
to O
prevent O
the O
too O
great O
influence O
of O
prejudice O
and O
dislike O
. O
We O
might O
think O
such O
feelings O
can O
do O
no O
harm O
, O
because O
only O
confined O
to O
our O
own O
minds O
, O
but O
they O
would O
be O
sure O
gradually O
to O
lead O
us O
to O
taking O
pleasure O
in O
listening O
to O
their O
dispraise O
, O
and O
joining O
in O
it O
, O
and O
to O
seeing O
and O
talking O
only O
of O
their O
faults O
, O
forgetting O
that O
if O
we O
had O
been O
circumstanced O
exactly O
as O
they O
are O
, O
we O
might O
have O
been O
just O
the O
same O
: O
and O
this O
is O
the O
feeling O
David S-PERSON
condemns O
in O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
Psalms O
we O
read O
this B-TIME
morning E-TIME
. O
Are O
you O
tired O
of O
listening O
to O
me O
, O
dearest O
, O
or O
shall O
we O
read O
it O
over O
again O
together O
? O
" O
Emmeline's S-PERSON
only O
answer O
was O
to O
run O
eagerly O
for O
her O
little O
Bible S-WORK_OF_ART
, O
and O
with O
glowing O
cheeks O
and O
sparkling O
eyes O
listen O
to O
her O
mother O
, O
as O
she O
turned O
to O
the O
fifteenth S-ORDINAL
Psalm S-WORK_OF_ART
, O
and O
reading O
it O
through O
, O
particularly O
pointed O
out O
the O
third S-ORDINAL
verse O
, O
and O
so O
explained O
it O
, O
as O
easily O
and O
happily O
to O
satisfy O
her O
child O
as O
to O
the O
Divine O
authority O
for O
all O
that O
she O
had O
said O
, O
and O
to O
stamp O
them O
still O
more O
forcibly O
on O
her O
memory O
. O
" O
And O
now O
I O
do O
not O
mean O
to O
talk O
to O
you O
any O
more O
, O
my O
darling O
, O
" O
she O
said O
, O
kissing O
the O
little O
earnest O
face O
upturned O
to O
hers O
. O
" O
You O
have O
heard O
quite O
enough O
to O
think O
about O
, O
and O
I O
am O
sure O
you O
will O
not O
forget O
it O
, O
so O
go O
and O
play O
| | O
Ellen S-PERSON
must O
be O
wondering O
what O
has O
become O
of O
you O
. O
" O
And O
again O
full O
of O
glee O
, O
the O
happy O
child O
bounded O
away O
, O
exclaiming O
, O
as O
she O
did O
so O
, O
" O
Poor O
Annie S-PERSON
, O
I O
am O
glad O
I O
am O
not O
exposed O
to O
such O
temptations O
, O
for O
I O
am O
sure O
I O
should O
not O
be O
able O
to O
resist O
them O
either O
. O
" O
But O
though O
any O
one O
who O
had O
seen O
her O
the B-TIME
next I-TIME
half I-TIME
hour E-TIME
might O
have O
fancied O
that O
a O
serious O
thought O
or O
sober O
task O
could O
not O
approach O
her O
, O
neither O
the O
conversation O
nor O
the O
Psalm S-WORK_OF_ART
was O
forgotten O
| | O
with O
Herbert's S-PERSON
explanatory O
assistance O
, O
she O
not O
only O
found O
the O
Psalm O
, O
but O
committed O
it O
to O
memory O
| | O
and O
the O
second S-ORDINAL
Sunday S-DATE
after O
her O
conversation O
with O
her O
mother O
, O
repeated O
it O
so O
correctly O
and O
prettily O
to O
her O
father O
, O
as O
to O
give O
her O
the O
delight O
of O
his O
caressing O
approbation O
. O
Learning O
correctly O
by O
rote O
was O
always O
her O
greatest O
trial O
, O
for O
her O
vivid O
fancy O
and O
very O
versatile O
powers O
occasioned O
her O
actual O
lessons O
to O
be O
considered O
such O
drudgery O
, O
as O
to O
require O
a O
great O
effort O
on O
her O
part O
to O
retain O
them O
. O
The O
sense O
, O
indeed O
, O
if O
she O
understood O
it O
, O
she O
learned O
quickly O
enough O
| | O
but O
she O
preferred O
her O
own O
language O
to O
any O
one's O
else O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
had O
some O
difficulty O
in O
making O
her O
understand O
that O
in O
time O
of O
study O
she O
required O
correctness O
, O
and O
not O
fancy O
| | O
and O
that O
the O
attention O
which O
was O
necessary O
to O
conquer O
the O
words O
as O
well O
as O
the O
sense O
of O
the O
lesson O
, O
was O
much O
more O
important O
and O
valuable O
, O
however O
disagreeable O
it O
might O
seem O
, O
than O
the O
facility O
of O
changing O
the O
language O
to O
something O
prettier O
than O
the O
original O
. O
When O
, O
therefore O
, O
as O
in O
the O
present O
case O
, O
she O
voluntarily O
undertook O
, O
and O
conquered O
really O
a O
difficult O
task O
for O
a O
little O
lively O
girl O
, O
her O
parents O
had O
no O
scruple O
in O
giving O
the O
only O
reward O
she O
cared O
for O
— O
their O
approbation O
. O
It O
was O
in O
the O
bestowal O
of O
praise O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
was O
compelled O
to O
be O
almost O
painfully O
guarded O
. O
She O
found O
that O
the O
least O
expression O
of O
unusual O
approbation O
caused O
Caroline S-PERSON
to O
relax O
in O
her O
efforts O
, O
thinking O
she O
had O
done O
quite O
enough O
, O
and O
perniciously O
increasing O
her O
already O
too O
exalted O
ideas O
of O
herself O
. O
While O
to O
Emmeline S-PERSON
it O
was O
the O
most O
powerful O
incentive O
to O
a O
continuance O
in O
improvement O
, O
and O
determined O
conquest O
of O
her O
faults O
. O
There O
was O
constantly O
a O
dread O
on O
the O
mother's O
heart O
, O
that O
Caroline S-PERSON
would O
one O
day O
accuse O
her O
of O
partiality O
, O
from O
the O
different O
measure O
of O
her O
approbation O
which O
she O
was O
compelled O
to O
bestow O
| | O
and O
yet O
painful O
as O
it O
was O
to O
persevere O
under O
such O
an O
impression O
, O
the O
future O
welfare O
of O
both O
was O
too O
precious O
to O
be O
risked O
for O
the O
gratification O
of O
the O
present O
. O
She O
was O
watching O
with O
delight O
Emmeline's S-PERSON
unrestrained O
enjoyment O
of O
her O
father's O
caresses O
and O
lively O
conversation O
, O
in O
which O
Percy S-PERSON
as O
usual O
joined O
— O
for O
Tiny S-PERSON
, O
as O
he O
chose O
to O
call O
her O
, O
was O
his O
especial O
pet O
and O
plaything O
— O
when O
she O
was O
startled O
by O
a O
low O
and O
evidently O
suppressed O
sob O
near O
her O
| | O
Ellen S-PERSON
was O
bending O
over O
a O
book O
of O
Bible S-WORK_OF_ART
- O
stories O
which O
Herbert S-PERSON
had O
lent O
her O
, O
and O
her O
long O
ringlets O
completely O
concealed O
her O
face O
| | O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
and O
Caroline S-PERSON
both O
looked O
up O
surprised O
, O
but O
a O
rapid O
sign O
from O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
prevented O
their O
making O
any O
remark O
. O
Herbert S-PERSON
fixed O
his O
eyes O
pityingly O
on O
his O
little O
cousin O
as O
if O
wishing O
but O
not O
liking O
to O
address O
her O
. O
Edward S-PERSON
was O
the O
only O
one O
of O
the O
party O
who O
moved O
. O
He O
was O
busily O
engaged O
in O
examining O
a O
large O
Noah's O
ark O
, O
and O
speculating O
as O
to O
its O
resemblance O
to O
a O
ship O
, O
and O
its O
powers O
of O
floating O
, O
but O
after O
a O
few O
minutes' O
apparent O
thought O
he O
left O
it O
, O
and O
sitting O
down O
on O
Ellen's S-PERSON
chair O
, O
put O
his O
arm O
round O
her O
, O
and O
begged O
her O
to O
find O
a O
picture O
of O
Noah's O
ark O
, O
and O
see O
if O
it O
were O
at O
all O
like O
the O
toy O
. O
Cheered O
by O
his O
affection O
, O
she O
conquered O
with O
a O
strong O
effort O
the O
choking O
in O
her O
throat O
, O
and O
turned O
to O
the O
page O
, O
and O
tried O
to O
sympathize O
in O
his O
wonder O
if O
it O
really O
were O
like O
the O
vessel O
in O
which O
Noah S-PERSON
was O
saved O
, O
and O
where O
he O
could O
have O
put O
all O
the O
animals O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
joined O
them O
, O
and O
without O
taking O
more O
notice O
of O
Ellen's O
very O
pale O
cheeks O
and O
heavy O
eyes O
, O
than O
gently O
to O
put O
back O
the O
thick O
tresses O
that O
seemed O
to O
annoy O
her O
by O
their O
weight O
, O
gave O
them O
so O
much O
interesting O
information O
on O
the O
subject O
, O
and O
so O
delighted O
Edward S-PERSON
with O
allowing O
him O
to O
drag O
down O
several O
books O
from O
the O
library O
to O
find O
out O
all O
they O
said O
about O
it O
, O
that O
two B-TIME
hours E-TIME
slipped O
away O
quite O
unconsciously O
| | O
and O
Ellen's S-PERSON
very O
painful O
feeling O
had O
been O
so O
soothed O
, O
that O
she O
could O
smile O
, O
and O
join O
Emmeline S-PERSON
in O
making O
all O
the O
animals O
walk O
in O
grand O
procession O
to O
their O
temporary O
dwelling O
. O
But O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
did O
not O
forget O
the O
child's O
involuntary O
evidence O
of O
suffering O
, O
and O
vainly O
tried O
to O
imagine O
what O
at O
that O
moment O
could O
have O
caused O
it O
. O
Herbert S-PERSON
seemed O
to O
think O
about O
it O
, O
too O
, O
for O
the O
next O
day O
she O
heard O
him O
ask O
Edward S-PERSON
— O
" O
If O
he O
knew O
why O
his O
sister O
always O
looked O
so O
sad O
? O
if O
he O
thought O
it O
was O
because O
she O
was O
not O
yet O
reconciled O
to O
Oakwood S-GPE
? O
" O
" O
It O
is O
not O
that O
, O
" O
was O
Edward's S-PERSON
reply O
: O
" O
she O
has O
always O
looked O
and O
seemed O
sad O
, O
as O
long O
as O
I O
can O
remember O
her O
. O
One S-CARDINAL
reason O
may O
be O
, O
she O
was O
always O
ill O
in O
India S-GPE
, O
and O
papa O
was O
often O
telling O
me O
how O
very O
much O
she O
suffered O
, O
and O
how O
patiently O
she O
bore O
it O
| | O
and O
then O
, O
too O
, O
she O
knew O
I O
was O
poor O
mamma's O
favorite O
, O
( O
his O
voice O
trembled O
) O
, O
and O
that O
used O
to O
make O
her O
very O
unhappy O
| | O
but O
I O
do O
not O
know O
why O
she O
is O
so O
very O
sad O
now O
, O
unless O
she O
is O
ill O
again O
, O
and O
that O
no O
one O
can O
tell O
, O
for O
she O
never O
will O
complain O
. O
" O
" O
Was O
your O
sister O
such O
a O
constant O
sufferer O
then O
? O
" O
inquired O
his O
aunt O
. O
" O
Come O
here O
, O
and O
tell O
me O
all O
you O
can O
about O
her O
Edward S-PERSON
. O
I O
wish O
I O
could O
know O
more O
about O
both O
your O
lives O
in O
India S-GPE
. O
" O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
with O
eager O
willingness O
, O
communicated O
all O
he O
knew O
, O
though O
, O
from O
his O
being O
so O
constantly O
with O
his O
mother O
, O
and O
Ellen S-PERSON
so O
much O
left O
with O
her O
father O
and O
herself O
, O
that O
all O
was O
little O
enough O
| | O
adding O
, O
however O
, O
that O
after O
her O
very O
dangerous O
illness O
, O
when O
she O
was O
eight B-DATE
years I-DATE
old E-DATE
, O
he O
perfectly O
well O
remembered O
hearing O
some O
celebrated O
physician O
say O
to O
his O
father O
she O
would O
probably O
feel O
the O
effects O
of O
it O
all O
her O
life O
. O
" O
It O
was O
a O
very O
long O
time O
before O
mamma O
permitted O
me O
to O
see O
her O
, O
" O
added O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
" O
and O
when O
I O
did O
, O
I O
remember O
being O
almost O
frightened O
, O
she O
was O
so O
altered O
, O
so O
pale O
, O
and O
thin O
, O
and O
weak O
| | O
and O
then O
she O
was O
very O
ill O
after O
poor O
papa's O
death O
| | O
but O
since O
then O
she O
has O
never O
complained O
, O
and O
never O
kept O
her O
bed O
| | O
but O
I O
know O
she O
is O
often O
in O
pain O
, O
for O
when O
I O
have O
touched O
her O
forehead O
sometimes O
, O
it O
has O
burnt O
my O
hand O
like O
fire O
. O
" O
This O
childish O
explanation O
certainly O
told O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
more O
than O
she O
had O
known O
before O
| | O
but O
that O
Ellen S-PERSON
had O
witnessed O
the O
fearful O
scene O

Edward S-PERSON

as O
he O
grew O
older O
, O
though O
he O
did O
not O
know O
why O
, O
seemed O
to O
shrink O
from O
the O
subject O

particularly O
that O
he O
had O
been O
at O
a O
ball O
the O

awful O
night O

A O
few O
days O
afterward O
, O
as O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
was O
crossing O
the O
large O
hall O
on O
her O
way O
to O
the O
school O

room O

for O

spite O
of O
Percy's S-PERSON
determination O
that O
it O
should O
receive O
the O
more O
learned O
and O
refined O
appellation O
of O
studio O
, O
it O
was O
still O
called O
— O
she O
overheard O
Caroline's S-PERSON
voice O
, O
exclaiming O
in O
angry O
impatience O
— O
" O
Indeed O
, O
I O
shall O
not O

I O
have O
enough O
to O
do O
with O
my O
own O
lessons O
, O
without O
attending O
to O
other O
people's O
. O
It O
is O
your O
idleness O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
not O
the O
difficulty O
of O
your O
lesson O

for O
I O
am O
sure O
it O
is O
easy O
enough O

" O
" O
For O
shame O
, O
Caroline S-PERSON
! O
" O
was O
Emmeline's S-PERSON
indignant O
reply O
" O
She O
is O
not O
idle O
, O
and O
I O
am O
sure O
her O
lesson O
is O
not O
so O
easy O

I O
wish O
I O
could O
explain O
it O
properly O
. O
" O
" O
You O
know O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
herself O
said O
she O
was O
careless O
or O
idle O
to O
- O
day O
, O
and O
she O
must O
know O
. O
I O
am O
not O
going O
to O
lose O
my O
hour O
of O
recreation O
to O
help O
those O
who O
won't O
help O
themselves O
. O
" O
" O
How O
can O
you O
be O
so O
ill O
- O
natured O
, O
so O
unkind O
! O
" O
began O
Emmeline S-PERSON

but O
Ellen's S-PERSON
beseeching O
voice O
interrupted O
her O
— O
" O
Do O
not O
quarrel O
with O
your O
sister O

my O
account O

dearest O
Emmeline S-PERSON

I O
dare O
say O
I O
am O
very O
stupid O

my O
head O
does O
feel O
confused O

- O
day O

not O

me O

dear O
Emmy O

go O
with O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
aunt O
Emmeline S-PERSON
will O
not O
like O
your O
remaining O
in O
. O
" O
Caroline S-PERSON
had O
already O
quitted O
the O
room O
, O
and O
in O
her O
haste O
ran O
against O
her O
mother O
, O
who O
she O
instantly O
perceived O
had O
heard O
all O
she O
said O
. O
With O
a O
deep O
blush O
, O
she O
turned O
as O
to O
re-enter O
the O
school O
- O
room O
, O
but O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
stopped O
her O
— O
" O
No O
, O
" O
she O
said O
, O
gravely O
, O
" O
if O
you O
are O
only O
to O
act O
kindly O
for O
fear O
of O
my O
reproof O
, O
it O
will O
do O
no O
good O
either O
to O
yourself O
or O
Ellen S-PERSON

I O
could O
scarcely O
have O
believed O
it O
possible O
you O
should O
so O
have O
spoken O
, O
had O
I O
not O
heard O
it O

Go O
and O
amuse O
yourself O
as O
you O
intended O

I O
rather O
think O
had O
you O
given O
up O
a O
little O
of O
your O
time O
to O
help O
your O
cousin O
, O
you O
would O
have O
experienced O
more O
real O
pleasure O
than O
you O
will O
now O
feel O
all O
day O
. O
" O
" O
Dear O
mamma O
, O
will O
you O
help O
Ellen S-PERSON
? O
" O
asked O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
very O
timidly O
, O
for O
though O
at O
Ellen's S-PERSON
reiterated O
entreaty O
she O
had O
left O
her O
, O
she O
felt O
it O
almost O
disrespect O
to O
run O
across O
the O
hall O
while O
her O
mother O
was O
speaking O

and O
the O
thought O
suddenly O
crossed O
her O
that O
, O
as O
she O
was O
quite O
sure O
Ellen S-PERSON
was O
not O
idle O
though O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
thought O
she O
was O
, O
her O
mother O
, O
by O
assisting O
her O
, O
might O
save O
her O
from O
increased O
displeasure O
. O
" O
Yes O
, O
dearest O
, O
if O
necessary O

I O
have O
heard O
enough O
to O
satisfy O
me O
that O
you O

you O
could O

so O
I O
will O

for O
your O
sake O

" O
And O
Emmeline S-PERSON
ran O
away O
, O
quite O
happy O
, O
to O
try O
all O
she O
could O
to O
soothe O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
whose O
self O
- O
reproach O
had O
as O
usual O
terminated O
in O
a O
fit O
of O
ill O
- O
temper O
and O
anger O
against O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
instead O
of O
against O
herself O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
entered O
the O
school O
- O
room O
, O
and O
stood O
by O
Ellen S-PERSON
so O
quietly O
that O
the O
child O
did O
not O
perceive O
her O
. O
Her O
attention O
was O
completely O
absorbed O
in O
her O
book O
| | O
but O
after O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes E-TIME
she O
suddenly O
pushed O
it O
from O
her O
, O
and O
exclaiming O
almost O
passionately O
: O
" O
I O
can O
not O
learn O
it O
, O
try O
all O
I O
can O
! O

Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
will O
be O
so O
very O
, O
very O
angry O
" O
— O
and O
she O
gave O
way O
, O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
since O
her O
arrival O
at O
Oakwood S-GPE
, O
to O
a O
violent O
burst O
of O
tears O
. O
" O
What O
is O
this O
very O
, O
very O
difficult O
lesson O
, O
my O
little O
Ellen S-PERSON
! O
" O
inquired O
her O
aunt O
, O
kindly O
taking O
one S-CARDINAL
hand O
from O
her O
face O
. O
" O
Tell O
me O
, O
and O
we O
shall O
be O
able O

learn O
it O
together O

perhaps O
. O
" O
" O
Oh O
, O
no O
, O
no O
! O
it O
is O
because O
I O
am O
so O
very O
stupid O

Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
has O
explained O
it O
to O
me O
twice O
, O
and O
I O
know O
, O
I O
know O
, O
I O
ought O
to O
understand O
it O

— O
" O
" O
Well O

then O
, O
never O
mind O
it O
to O
- O
day O

can O
all O
learn O
much O
better O
some O
days O
than O
others O

know O

morrow O
you O
will O
be O
able O

conquer O
it O

" O
" O
But O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
is O
already O
displeased O

and O
she O
will O
be O
still O
more O
so O
, O
if O
I O
leave O
it O
without O
her O
permission O

" O
replied O
the O
sobbing O
girl O
, O
longing O
, O

not O
daring O
, O
to O
throw O
her O
arms O
round O
her O
aunt's O
neck O

lean O
her O
aching O
head O
against O
her O
bosom O

" O
Not O
if O
I O
beg O
a O
reprieve O

" O
replied O
her O
aunt O
, O
smiling O

" O

you O
must O
not O
let O
it O
make O
you O
so O
very O
unhappy O

I O
am O
afraid O

your O

that O
you O

me O

you O
more O
happy O

at O
home O

" O
" O
Oh O
, O
nothing O
, O
nothing O
! O
" O
replied O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
struggling O
with O
her O
tears O
. O
" O
Indeed O
I O
am O
happier O
than O
I O
ever O
thought O

when O
you O
are O
so O
good O

so O
kind O

My O
head O
ached O
to O
- O
day O
, O

that O
always O
makes O
me O
feel O
a O
wish O

indeed O

, O
as O
if O
frightened O
at O
her O
own O
confession O

she O
hid O
her O
face O
in O
her O
aunt's O
dress O

Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
lifted O
her O
into O
her O
lap O

kissed O
her O
without O
speaking O

" O
You O
must O
learn O

love O
me O
more O

more O

my O
Ellen S-PERSON

after O
a O
pause O

no O

my O

good O
papa O

" O
the O
word O
was O
almost O
choked O
with O
sobs O

used O
to O
fondle O
me O

praise O
me O

call O
me O
his O
darling O

Emmeline S-PERSON
last B-DATE
Sunday E-DATE

when O
I O
was O
ill O

ill O

said O

when O
his O
military O
duties O
called O
him O
away O

he O
used O
to O
nurse O
me O
, O

try O
to O
amuse O
me O

that O
I O
might O
forget O
pain O

weakness O

I O
shall O
never O
, O
never O
forget O
that O
dreadful O
night O
! O
" O
and O
she O
closed O
her O
eyes O
and O
shuddered O
, O
as O
the O
horrid O
scene O
of O
blood O
and O
death O
flashed O
before O
her O
. O
" O
What O
dreadful O
night O
my O
poor O
child O
? O
" O
inquired O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
soothingly O
, O
after O
doubting O
whether O
or O
not O
it O
would O
be O
better O
for O
Ellen S-PERSON
to O
pursue O
such O
an O
evidently O
painful O
theme O
, O
and O
no O
longer O
requiring O
an O
explanation O
of O
her O
emotion O
the O
previous O
Sabbath O
. O
" O
The O
night O
poor O
papa O
was O
killed O
| | O
— O
oh O
, O
there O
were O
so O
many O
horrid O
forms O
on O
the O
grass O
, O
the O
natives O
and O
poor O
papa's O
own O
men O
, O
and O
they O
looked O
so O
ghastly O
in O
the O
moonlight O
, O
and O
the O
grass O
was O
covered O
with O
blood O
and O
limbs O
and O
heads O
that O
had O
been O
shot O
off O

and O
there O
were O
such O
cries O
and O
groans O
of O
pain O

I O
see O
it O
, O
I O
hear O
it O
all O
again O
so O
often O
before O
I O
go O
to O
sleep O
, O

when O
my O
head O
feels O
as O
it O
does O
to O
- O
day O
, O
and O
fancy O
I O
hear O
poor O
papa's O
last O
words O
and O
feel O
his O
kiss O
as O
he O
lay O
bleeding O
, O
bleeding O
slowly O
to O
death O
and O
his O
voice O
was O
so O
strange O
, O
and O
his O
lips O
so O
cold O
! O
" O
" O
But O
how O
came O
you O
in O
such O
a O
dreadful O
scene O
, O
my O
poor O
Ellen S-PERSON
? O
who O
could O
have O
permitted O
such O
a O
little O
child O
to O
be O
there O
? O
" O
" O
Because O
I O
wished O
it O
so O
very O
much O

I O
knew O
he O
would O
die O
before O
they O
could O
bring O
him O
to O
me O
, O
and O
I O
did O
so O
want O
to O
feel O
his O
kiss O
and O
hear O
his O
voice O
once O
more O
. O
Oh O
, O
aunt O
Emmeline S-PERSON
! O
shall O
I O
never O
see O
him O
again O
? O
I O
know O
he O
can O
not O
come O
to O
me O

shall O
I O
, O
oh O
, O
shall O
I O
ever O
be O
good O
enough O
to O
go O
to O
him O

" O
And O
she O
looked O
up O
in O
her O
aunt's O
face O
with O
such O
a O
countenance O
of O
beseeching O
entreaty O
, O
that O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
eyes O
filled O
with O
tears O

it O
was O
a B-TIME
full I-TIME

she O
did O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
felt O
more O
relieved O
and O
comforted O
, O
than O
on O
the O
subject O
of O
her O
father's O
death O
she O
had O
ever O
felt O
before O
. O
From O
her O
mother O
not O
being O
able O
to O
bear O
the O
subject O
even O
partially O
alluded O
to O
, O
and O
from O
having O
no O
one O
to O
whom O
she O
could O
speak O
of O
it O
, O
it O
had O
taken O
a O
still O
stronger O
hold O
of O
her O
imagination O
| | O
and O
whenever O
she O
was O
unusually O
weak O
, O
and O
her O
head O
aching O
and O
confused O
, O
it O
became O
still O
more O
vivid O
. O
The O
very O
visible O
sympathy O
and O
interest O
of O
her O
aunt O
, O
and O
the O
gentle O
words O
in O
which O
she O
tried O
to O
turn O
the O
child's O
thoughts O
from O
that O
scene O
of O
horror O
to O
the O
happiness O
of O
her O
father O
in O
Heaven O
, O
and O
an O
assurance O
that O
, O
if O
she O
tried O
to O
do O
her O
duty O
, O
and O
to O
love O
and O
serve O
God O
, O
and O
trust O
in O
His O
mercy O
to O
render O
her O
efforts O
acceptable O
, O
she O
would O
rejoin O
him O
, O
seemed O
to O
remove O
the O
mass O
of O
tangled O
thought O
within O
her O
young O
mind O
. O
Her O
head O
, O
indeed O
, O
still O
ached O
very O
painfully O
, O
and O
her O
eyes O
seemed O
as O
if O
they O
would O
close O
, O
notwithstanding O
all O
her O
efforts O
to O
keep O
them O
open O
| | O
but O
when O
she O
awoke O
from O
a O
long O
quiet O
sleep O
, O
on O
the O
sofa O
in O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's O
dressing O
- O
room O
, O
where O
her O
aunt O
had O
laid O
her O
, O
and O
found O
that O
kind O
friend O
still O
watching O
over O
her O
, O
the O
little O
heart O
and O
temples O
had O
ceased O
to O
throb O
so O
quickly O
, O
and O
she O
felt O
better O
and O
happier O
. O
Mr. O
Maitland S-PERSON
, O
the O
medical O
friend O
of O
the O
family O
, O
confirmed O
the O
opinion O
which O
Edward S-PERSON
had O
said O
their O
physician O
in O
India S-GPE
had O
given O
of O
his O
sister's O
state O
of O
health O
. O
He O
did O
not O
, O
he O
said O
, O
consider O
her O
liable O
to O
serious O
illness O
, O
or O
of O
a O
constitution O
that O
would O
not O
endure O
| | O
but O
that O
he O
feared O
it O
would O
be O
some O
years O
before O
she O
knew O
the O
blessing O
of O
really O
good O
health O
, O
and O
be O
constantly O
subject O
to O
that O
lassitude O
, O
severe O
headache O
, O
and O
the O
depression O
of O
the O
whole O
system O
thence O
proceeding O
, O
which O
must O
prevent O
the O
liveliness O
and O
quickness O
of O
acquirement O
natural O
to O
most O
children O
. O
He O
thought O
the O
evil O
had O
been O
very O
greatly O
increased O
by O
want O
of O
sufficient O
care O
in O
early O
years O
, O
and O
the O
unwholesome O
climate O
in O
which O
she O
had O
so O
long O
lived O
, O
that O
he O
wondered O
her O
mother O
had O
not O
been O
advised O
to O
send O
her O
over O
to O
England S-GPE
, O
adding O
, O
with O
a O
smile O
, O
he O
was O
quite O
sure O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
would O
not O
have O
refused O
the O
charge O
, O
anxious O
as O
it O
might O
have O
been O
. O
And O
earnestly O
, O
not O
only O
on O
account O
of O
the O
child's O
physical O
but O
mental O
health O
, O
did O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
wish O
that O
such O
had O
been O
the O
case O
, O
and O
that O
she O
had O
had O
the O
care O
of O
her O
niece O
from O
earliest O
infancy O
| | O
and O
how O
much O
more O
would O
she O
have O
wished O
this O
, O
had O
she O
known O
that O
Mrs. O
Fortescue S-PERSON
had O
really O
been O
advised O
to O
do O
with O
Ellen S-PERSON
as O
Mr. O
Maitland S-PERSON
had O
said O
, O
but O
that O
believing O
it O
merely O
an O
idle O
fancy O
, O
and O
persisting O
, O
too O
, O
in O
her O
own O
headstrong O
idea O
, O
that O
it O
was O
ill O
- O
temper O
, O
not O
illness O
, O
which O
rendered O
Ellen S-PERSON
so O
disagreeable O
, O
she O
would O
not O
stoop O
so O
to O
conquer O
her O
unfortunate O
pride O
as O
to O
ask O
such O
a O
favor O
of O
her O
relatives O
, O
and O
to O
whom O
else O
could O
she O
appeal O
? O
Colonel O
Fortescue S-PERSON
had O
none O
but O
distant O
cousins O
. O
She O
did O
satisfy O
a O
qualm O
of O
conscience O
by O
once O
suggesting O
to O
her O
husband O
— O
as O
her O
own O
idea O
, O
however O
, O
not O
as O
that O
of O
an O
experienced O
physician O
— O
that O
as O
he O
fancied O
Ellen S-PERSON
was O
always O
ill O
, O
she O
might O
be O
better O
in O
England S-GPE
| | O
but O
, O
as O
she O
expected O
, O
not O
only O
his O
intense O
love O
for O
his O
little O
girl O
rose O
up O
against O
the O
idea O
of O
separation O
, O
but O
his O
pride O
revolted O
from O
sending O
her O
to O
claim O
the O
pity O
of O
relatives O
who O
had O
so O
completely O
cast O
off O
her O
parents O
: O
yet O
had O
he O
been O
told O
it O
was O
absolutely O
necessary O
for O
her O
health O
and O
so O
greatly O
for O
her O
happiness O
, O
he O
would O
not O
have O
hesitated O
to O
sacrifice O
every O
thought O
of O
self O
. O
But O
Eleanor S-PERSON
, O
satisfied O
that O
she O
had O
done O
her O
duty O
, O
and O
delighted O
that O
in O
one S-CARDINAL
respect O
he O
was O
quite O
as O
proud O
as O
she O
was O
, O
never O
again O
referred O
to O
the O
subject O
, O
and O
the O
physician O
who O
had O
thus O
advised O
, O
from O
his O
constant O
removals O
, O
he O
never O
chanced O
to O
meet O
. O
Great O
, O
indeed O
, O
was O
the O
amount O
of O
childish O
suffering O
which O
this O
selfish O
decision O
, O
on O
the O
part O
of O
her O
mother O
, O
occasioned O
Ellen S-PERSON
. O
We O
do O
not O
mean O
the O
pain O
of O
constant O
languor O
itself O
, O
though O
that O
in O
its O
full O
amount O
our O
happy O
healthful O
young O
readers O
can O
not O
have O
the O
least O
idea O
of O
: O
they O
, O
perhaps O
, O
think O
it O
almost O
a O
pleasant O
change O
, O
the O
care O
, O
and O
petting O
, O
and O
presents O
so O
often O
lavished O
on O
a O
brief O
decided O
illness O
: O
but O
that O
is O
a O
very O
different O
thing O
to O
that O
kind O
of O
suffering O
which O
only O
so O
affects O
them O
as O
to O
be O
dull O
and O
heavy O
, O
they O
do O
not O
know O
why O
, O
and O
to O
make O
it O
such O
a O
very O
difficult O
task O
to O
learn O
the O
lessons O
others O
find O
so O
easy O
| | O
and O
such O
a O
pain O
sometimes O
to O
move O
, O
that O
they O
are O
thought O
slow O
and O
unwilling O
, O
and O
perhaps O
even O
idle O
, O
when O
they O
would O
gladly O
run O
, O
and O
help O
, O
and O
work O
as O
others O

and O
so O
weak O
sometimes O
, O
that O
tears O
start O
at O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
harsh O
or O
unkind O
word O
, O
and O
they O
are O
thought O
cross O
, O
when O
they O
do O
not O
in O
the O
least O
feel O
so O
| | O
and O
this O
, O
not O
for O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
weeks E-DATE
, O
but O
, O
with O
few O
exceptions O
, O
the O
trial O
of O
months B-DATE
and I-DATE
even I-DATE
years E-DATE
. O
And O
this O
was O
Ellen's S-PERSON
— O
which O
not O
even O
the O
tenderest O
and O
most O
unfailing O
care O
of O
her O
aunt O
could O
entirely O
guard O
her O
from O
. O
It O
is O
a O
most O
difficult O
thing O
for O
those O
who O
are O
strong O
and O
healthy O
themselves O
to O
understand O
and O
always O
bear O
with O
physical O
suffering O
in O
others O
. O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
, O
though O
in O
general O
free O
from O
any O
thing O
like O
prejudice O
, O
and O
ardently O
desirous O
to O
follow O
up O
her O
own O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
ideas O
of O
right O
and O
wrong O
, O
could O
not O
so O
govern O
her O
affections O
as O
to O
feel O
the O
same O
toward O
Ellen S-PERSON
as O
she O
did O
toward O
Edward S-PERSON
and O
the O
children O
she O
had O
lived O
with O
and O
taught O
so O
long O
. O
Her O
task O
with O
Ellen S-PERSON
required O
more O
patience O
and O
forbearance O
and O
care O
than O
with O
either O
of O
the O
others O
, O
and O
sometimes O
she O
could O
not O
help O
believing O
and O
acting O
toward O
her O
as O
if O
it O
were O
willful O
idleness O
and O
carelessness O
, O
not O
the O
languor O
of O
disease O
. O
With O
the O
recollection O
and O
evidence O
of O
Herbert S-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
been O
delicate O
from O
his O
birth O
, O
and O
who O
was O
yet O
of O
such O
a O
remarkably O
gifted O
mind O
, O
and O
so O
bright O
in O
aspect O
, O
so O
sweet O
in O
temper O
, O
that O
illness O
seemed O
to O
have O
spiritualized O
instead O
of O
deadened O
every O
faculty O
, O
she O
could O
not O
understand O
, O
as O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
did O
, O
the O
force O
of O
circumstances O
in O
producing O
from O
nearly O
the O
same O
cause O
two S-CARDINAL
much O
different O
effects O
, O
nor O
how O
it O
was O
that O
complete O
neglect O
had O
engendered O
more O
evils O
than O
indiscreet O
indulgence O
| | O
but O
that O
it O
appeared O
to O
have O
done O
so O
, O
was O
unhappily O
only O
too O
evident O
not O
only O
to O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
but O
to O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
. O
It O
seemed O
almost O
surprising O
, O
and O
certainly O
a O
proof O
of O
a O
remarkably O
good O
disposition O
, O
that O
Edward S-PERSON
appeared O
so O
free O
from O
great O
faults O
, O
and O
of O
such O
a O
warm O
, O
generous O
, O
frank O
, O
and O
seemingly O
unselfish O
nature O
, O
so O
open O
to O
conviction O
and O
to O
all O
good O
impressions O
, O
that O
, O
except O
occasional O
fits O
of O
violent O
passion O
, O
there O
really O
was O
, O
as O
far O
as O
his O
aunt O
and O
uncle O
could O
perceive O
, O
nothing O
to O
complain O
of O
. O
They O
did O
not O
know O
that O
he O
stood O
in O
such O
awe O
of O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
from O
his O
mother's O
lessons O
of O
his O
exceeding O
sternness O
, O
that O
he O
exercised O
the O
greatest O
control O
over O
himself O
| | O
and O
he O
was O
so O
excessively O
fond O
of O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
, O
and O
his O
days O
glided O
by O
in O
such O
varied O
and O
delightful O
employment O
, O
that O
there O
was O
no O
temptation O
to O
do O
wrong O
, O
except O
certain O
acts O
of O
trifling O
disobedience O
, O
of O
more O
consequence O
from O
the O
self O
- O
will O
they O
betrayed O
than O
the O
acts O
themselves O
, O
but O
which O
might O
have O
been O
sources O
of O
anxiety O
to O
his O
aunt O
, O
and O
lessened O
her O
confidence O
in O
him O
had O
she O
known O
them O
| | O
but O
she O
did O
not O
, O
for O
Ellen S-PERSON
not O
only O
constantly O
concealed O
, O
but O
she O
was O
the O
sufferer O
for O
him O
, O
and O
so O
brought O
reproof O
and O
suspicion O
on O
herself O
, O
which O
, O
could O
the O
truth O
have O
been O
known O
, O
might O
have O
been O
averted O
. O
But O
truth O
of O
act O
as O
well O
as O
word O
had O
never O
been O
impressed O
on O
Edward S-PERSON
| | O
and O
, O
therefore O
, O
though O
he O
was O
constitutionally O
too O
brave O
to O
utter O
a O
falsehood O
, O
too O
honorable O
to O
shield O
himself O
at O
the O
expense O
of O
another O
, O
if O
he O
knew O
that O
other O
suffered O
, O
he O
had O
been O
too O
long O
taught O
to O
believe O
that O
Ellen S-PERSON
was O
his O
inferior O
, O
and O
must O
always O
give O
up O
to O
him O
, O
to O
imagine O
that O
he O
was O
even O
acting O
deceitfully O
or O
unmanfully O
in O
permitting O
her O
to O
conceal O
his O
acts O
of O
disobedience O
. O
There O
was O
so O
much O
to O
love O
and O
admire O
in O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
that O
neither O
Mr. O
nor O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
imagined O
the O
real O
weakness O
of O
his O
character O
— O
that O
those O
lovable O
qualities O
all O
sprung O
from O
natural O
impulse O
, O
unsustained O
by O
any O
thing O
like O
principle O
. O
The O
quickness O
and O

fervor O
with O
which O
he O
received O
the O
religious O
impressions O
they O
and O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
sought O
so O
earnestly O
to O
instill O
in O
the O
short O
time O
that O
was O
allowed O
them O
before O
he O
entered O
the O
navy O
, O
they O
augured O
so O
hopefully O
from O
, O
that O
not O
only O
his O
preceptor O
and O
uncle O
, O
but O
his O
ever O
anxious O
aunt O
, O
looked O
forward O
to O
his O
career O
with O
scarcely O
a O
doubt O
as O
to O
its O
probity O
and O
honor O
. O
Ellen S-PERSON
caused O
her O
infinitely O
more O
anxiety O
. O
There O
was O
a O
disregard O
to O
truth O
, O
a O
want O
of O
openness O
and O
candor O
, O
which O
, O
though O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
believed O
the O
effects O
of O
neglect O
and O
extreme O
timidity O
, O
both O
her O
husband O
and O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
feared O
were O
natural O
. O
Much O
, O
indeed O
, O
sprung O
from O
the O
poor O
child's O
mistaken O
idea O
of O
the O
nature O
and O
solemnity O
of O
the O
promise O
she O
had O
made O
her O
mother O
, O
and O
her O
constant O
watchfulness O
and O
determination O
to O
shield O
Edward S-PERSON
. O
For O
the O
disregard O
to O
truth O
, O
her O
mother O
had O
, O
indeed O
, O
alone O
been O
answerable O
. O
Ellen's S-PERSON
naturally O
very O
timid O
character O
required O
the O
inculcation O
of O
a O
high O
, O
firm O
principle O
, O
to O
enable O
her O
so O
to O
conquer O
herself O
as O
to O
speak O
the O
truth O
, O
even O
if O
she O
suffered O
from O
it O
. O
It O
was O
only O
, O
indeed O
, O
in O
extreme O
cases O
of O
fear O
— O
and O
never O
to O
her O
father O
that O
she O
had O
ever O
spoken O
falsely O

but O
to O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
high O
principles O
, O
which O
by O
extreme O
diligence O
and O
care O
she O
had O
so O
successfully O
imparted O
to O
her O
own O
children O
, O
even O
concealment O
was O
often O
an O
acted O
untruth O
, O
and O
of O
this O
fault O
and O
equivocation O
Ellen S-PERSON
was O
but O
too O
often O
guilty O

exciting O
Miss O
Harcourt's S-PERSON
and O
Caroline's S-PERSON
prejudices O
yet O
more O
against O
her O
. O
The O
latter O
, O
with O
all O
her O
faults O
, O
never O
swerved O
from O
the O
rigid O
truth O
, O
and O
had O
a O
strong O
contempt O
and O
dislike O
toward O
all O
those O
who O
did O
— O
except O
her O
friend O
Annie S-PERSON
, O
who O
, O
as O
she O
always O
took O
care O
to O
speak O
the O
truth O
to O
her O
, O
she O
did O
not O
suspect O
of O
being O
less O
careful O
than O
herself O
. O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
had O
some O
difficulty O
in O
restraining O
her O
love O
of O
exaggeration O
, O
and O
also O
in O
so O
conquering O
her O
own O
timidity O

fear O
as O
always O
to O
speak O
the O
truth O
, O
only O
pitied O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
but O
did O
not O
love O
her O
the O
less O
. O
Of O
course O
, O
it O
was O
not O
till O
some O
months O
had O
passed O
that O
these O
lights O
and O
shadows O
of O
character O
in O
the O
orphans O
, O
and O
in O
the O
opinions O
they O
culled O
forth O
in O
those O
around O
them O
, O
could O
be O
discovered O

but O
notwithstanding O
she O
stood O
almost O
alone O
in O
her O
opinion O
, O
notwithstanding O
there O
was O
very O
little O
outward O
evidence O
that O
she O
was O
correct O
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
believed O
there O
was O
a O
great O
deal O
more O
in O
her O
niece O
than O
was O
discernible O
. O
She O
seemed O
to O
possess O
a O
strength O
, O
almost O
an O
intensity O
, O
of O
feeling O
and O
warmth O
of O
affection O
, O
which O
, O
if O
properly O
guided O
, O
would O
effectually O
aid O
in O
removing O
the O
childish O
errors O
engendered O
by O
neglect O
| | O
and O
it O
was O
this O
belief O
which O
not O
only O
enabled O
her O
to O
bear O
calmly O
the O
anxiety O
and O
care O
, O
and O
often O
pain O
, O
which O
those O
faults O
and O
their O
compelled O
correction O
occasioned O
, O
but O
actually O
to O
love O
her O
niece O
, O
if O
possible O
, O
still O
more O
than O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
and O
very O
nearly O
with O
the O
same O
amount O
of O
quiet O
but O
intense O
affection O
which O
she O
felt O
for O
her O
own O
children O

A O
YOUNG O
GENTLEMAN O
IN O
A O
PASSION O

A O

A O
SCENE O
OF O
DISTRESS O
. O
One B-TIME
very I-TIME
fine I-TIME
morning E-TIME
in O
May S-DATE
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
invited O
Edward S-PERSON
to O
join O
her O
in O
a O
walk O
, O
intending O
also O
to O
call O
at O
Moorlands S-LOC
and O
Greville B-FAC
Manor E-FAC
on O
their O
way O
. O
The O
lads O
were O
released O
for O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
days E-DATE
from O
their O
attendance O
on O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
, O
that O
gentleman O
having O
been O
summoned O
on O
some O
clerical O
business O
to O
Exeter S-GPE
. O
Percy S-PERSON
was O
to O
accompany O
his O
father O
on O
an O
equestrian O
excursion O
| | O
Herbert S-PERSON
had O
been O
commissioned O
by O
Emmeline S-PERSON
some O
days O
before O
to O
take O
some O
books O
to O
Mary B-PERSON
Greville E-PERSON
, O
and O
had O
looked O
forward O
himself O
to O
spending O
a O
morning O
with O
her O
. O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
delighted O
at O
being O
selected O
as O
his O
aunt's O
companion O
, O
prepared O
with O
haste O
and O
glee O
for O
his O
excursion O
. O
Robert S-PERSON
was O
, O
however O
, O
unfortunately O
not O
at O
hand O
to O
give O
him O
a O
clean O
pair O
of O
shoes O
( O
he O
had O
already O
spoiled O
two S-CARDINAL
pair O
that O
morning O
by O
going O
into O
the O
stream O
which O
ran O
through O
the O
park O
to O
sail O
a O
newly O
- O
rigged O
frigate O
) O
, O
and O
angry O
at O
the O
delay O
, O
fearing O
that O
his O
aunt O
would O
not O
wait O
for O
him O
, O
he O
worked O
himself O
into O
such O
a O
violent O
passion O
, O
that O
when O
Robert S-PERSON
did O
appear O
he O
gave O
vent O
to O
more O
abusive O
language O
than O
he O
had O
ever O
yet O
ventured O
to O
use O
, O
concluding O
by O
hurling O
both O
his O
discarded O
shoes O
at O
the O
domestic O
, O
who O
only O
escaped O
a O
severe O
blow O
by O
starting O
aside O
, O
and O
permitting O
them O
to O
go O
through O
the O
window O
. O
" O
Robert S-PERSON
, O
leave O
the O
room O
: O
I O
desire O
that O
you O
will O
not O
again O
give O
your O
assistance O
to O
Master B-PERSON
Fortescue E-PERSON
till O
he O
knows O
how O
to O
ask O
it O
, O
" O
was O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
most O
unexpected O
interference O
, O
and O
Edward S-PERSON
so O
started O
at O
her O
voice O
and O
look O
, O
that O
his O
passion O
was O
suddenly O
calmed O
. O
" O
Finish O
your O
toilet O
, O
and O
when O
you O
have O
found O
your O
shoes O
and O
put O
them O
away O
, O
you O
may O
join O
me O
in O
the O
breakfast O
- O
room O
, O
Edward S-PERSON
. O
I O
only O
wait O
your O
pleasure O
. O
" O
And O
never O
did O
Edward S-PERSON
leave O
her O
presence O
more O
gladly O
. O
Shame O
had O
suddenly O
conquered O
anger O
| | O
and O
though O
his O
chest O
still O
heaved O
and O
his O
cheeks O
were O
still O
flushed O
, O
he O
did O
not O
utter O
another O
word O
till O
nearly B-QUANTITY
a I-QUANTITY
quarter I-QUANTITY
of I-QUANTITY
a I-QUANTITY
mile E-QUANTITY
on O
their O
walk O
. O
Twice O
he O
had O
looked O
up O
in O
his O
aunt's O
face O
as O
if O
about O
to O
speak O
, O
but O
the O
expression O
was O
so O
very O
grave O
, O
that O
he O
felt O
strangely O
afraid O
to O
proceed O
. O
At O
length O
he O
exclaimed O
— O
" O
You O
are O
displeased O
with O
me O
, O
dear O
aunt O
| | O
but O
indeed O
I O
could O
not O
help O
feeling O
angry O
. O
" O
" O
I O
am O
still O
more O
sorry O
than O
displeased O
, O
Edward S-PERSON
| | O
I O
had O
hoped O
you O
were O
learning O
more O
control O
, O
and O
to O
know O
your O
duty O
to O
a O
domestic O
better O
. O
Your O
uncle O
— O
" O
" O
Oh O
, O
pray O
do O
not O
tell O
him O
! O
" O
implored O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
" O
and O
I O
will O
ask O
Robert's S-PERSON
pardon O
the O
moment O
I O
go O
home O
. O
" O
" O
I O
certainly O
shall O
not O
complain O
of O
you O
to O
him O
, O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
if O
my O
arguments O
can O
convince O
you O
of O
your O
error O
| | O
but O
if O
you O
are O
only O
to O
ask O
Robert's S-PERSON
pardon O
for O
fear O
of O
your O
uncle O
, O
I O
would O
rather O
you O
should O
not O
do O
so O
. O
Tell O
me O
the O
truth O

if O
you O
were O
quite O
sure O
your O
uncle O
would O
know O
nothing O
about O
it O
, O
would O
you O
still O
ask O
Robert's S-PERSON
pardon O
? O
" O
Edward S-PERSON
unhesitatingly O
answered O
" O
No O
! O
" O
" O
And O
why O
not O
? O
" O
" O
Because O
I O
think O
he O
ought O
to O
ask O
mine O
for O
keeping O
me O
waiting O
as O
he O
did O
, O
and O
for O
being O
insolent O
first S-ORDINAL
to O
me O
. O
" O
" O
He O
did O
not O
keep O
you O
waiting O
above O
five B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
, O
and O
that O
was O
my O
fault O
not O
his O
, O
as O
I O
was O
employing O
him O

and O
as O
for O
insolence O
, O
can O
you O
tell O
me O
what O
he O
said O
? O
" O
Edward S-PERSON
hesitated O
. O
" O
I O
do O
not O
remember O
the O
exact O
words O
, O
but O
I O
know O
he O
called O
me O
impatient O
, O
and O
if O
I O
were O
, O
he O
had O
no O
right O
to O
tell O
me O
so O
. O
" O
" O
Nor O
did O
he O
. O
I O
heard O
all O
that O
passed O
, O
and O
I O
could O
not O
help O
thinking O
how O
very O
far O
superior O
was O
Robert S-PERSON
, O
a O
poor O
country O
youth O
, O
to O
the O
young O
gentleman O
who O
abused O
him O
. O
" O
The O
color O
rose O
to O
Edward's S-GPE
temples O
, O
but O
he O
set O
his O
teeth O
and O
clenched O
his O
hand O
, O
to O
prevent O
any O
farther O
display O
of O
anger O
| | O
and O
his O
aunt O
, O
after O
attentively O
observing O
him O
, O
continued O
— O
" O
He O
said O
that O
his O
young O
master O
Percy S-PERSON
never O
required O
impossibilities O
, O

though O
often O
impatient O
never O
abused O
him O

You O
heard O
the O
word O
, O
and O
feeling O
you O
had O
been O
so O
, O
believed O
he O
applied O
it O
to O
yourself O

" O
" O
But O
in O
what O
can O
he O
be O
my O
superior O
? O
" O
asked O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
low O
voice O
, O
as O
if O
still O
afraid O
his O
passion O
would O
regain O
ascendency O
. O
" O
I O
will O
answer O
your O
question O
by O
another O
, O
Edward S-PERSON
. O
Suppose O
any O
one O
had O
used O
abusive O
terms O
toward O
you O
, O
and O
contemptuously O
desired O
you O
to O
get O
out O
of O
their O
sight O

how O
would O
you O
have O
answered O

" O
" O
I O
would O
have O
struck O
him O
to O
the O
earth O

replied O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
passionately O
, O
and O
quite O
forgetting O
his O
wished O
for O
control O

" O
Neither O
equal O
nor O
superior O
should O
dare O
speak O
so O
to O
me O
again O

" O
" O
And O
what O
prevented O
Robert S-PERSON
acting O
in O
the O
same O
manner O
? O
Do O
you O
think O
he O
has O
no O
feeling O

— O
that O
he O
is O
incapable O
of O
such O
emotions O

" O
Edward S-PERSON
stood O
for O
a B-TIME

quite O
still O

" O
Edward S-PERSON
was O
again O
silent O
, O

his O

continued O
to O
talk O
to O
him O
so O
kindly O
yet O
so O
earnestly O

" O
" O
Are O
you O
really O
sorry O

Edward S-PERSON

do O
you O
only O
say O
this O

your O

" O
" O
Indeed O

I O
had O
quite O
forgotten O
him O

replied O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
earnestly O

" O
I O
deserve O
his O
anger O
, O

would O
willingly O
expose O
myself O
to O
it O

if O
it O

redeem O
my O
fault O

my O

than O
inflict O
any O
such O
pain O
upon O
you O

It O
will O
be O
a O
great O
pleasure O
to O
me O
if O
you O
can O
really O
so O
conquer O
yourself O
as O
to O
apologize O
to O
Robert S-PERSON

and O
I O
think O
the O
pain O
of O
so O
doing O
will O
enable O
you O
more O
easily O
to O
remember O
all O
we O
have O
been O
saying O

than O
if O
you O
weakly O
shrink O
from O
it O

The O
life O
you O
have O
chosen O
makes O
me O
even O
more O
anxious O
that O
you O
should O
become O
less O
passionate O
— O
than O
were O
you O
to O
remain O
longer O
with O
me O

I O
fear O
you O
will O
so O
often O

" O
I O
very O

sorrowfully O

remember O

the O
more O
difficult O
the O
task O

greater O
the O
reward O

that O
you O
can O
control O
anger O
I O
have O
, O
even O
during O
our O
walk O
, O
had O
a O
proof O

" O
Edward S-PERSON
looked O
up O
surprised O
. O
" O
Did O
you O
not O
feel O
very O
angry O

I O
said O
Robert S-PERSON

your O
superior O

" O
" O
Yes O

" O
replied O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
blushing O
deeply O
. O
" O
And O
yet O
you O
successfully O
checked O
your O
rising O
passion O
, O
for O
fear O
of O
offending O
me O
. O
I O
can O
not O
be O
always O
near O
you O

but O
, O
my O
dear O
boy O
, O
you O
must O
endeavor O
to O
remember O
that O
lesson O
I O
have O
tried O

teach O
you O
so O
often O

that O
you O
are O

commit O
the O
most O

act O

offending O
God O

If O
you O
would O

ask O
for O
His O
help O

recollect O
that O
to O
offend O
Him O
is O
far O
more O
terrible O
than O
to O
incur O
the O
displeasure O
of O
either O
your O
uncle O

myself O
, O
I O
think O
you O
would O
find O
your O
task O
much O
easier O
, O
than O
if O
you O
attempted O
it O
, O
trusting O
in O
your O
own O
strength O
alone O

only O
for O
fear O

" O
Edward S-PERSON

not O
make O
any O

his O
countenance O
expressed O
such O
earnest O
thought O

softened O

that O
Mrs. O

on O

little O
gate O

on O

rich O
meadow O

path O

exclamation O

down O

limpid O
waters O

deep O
azure O
seemed O

mock O
the O
very O
heavens O

The O
Dart S-PERSON
from O
that O
point O
seemed O
no O

meandering O
river O

it O
was O
so O
encompassed O
by O
thick O

gracefully O
over O

. O
Mrs. O
Greville S-PERSON
was O
not O
there O
, O
though O
the O
books O
, O
work O
, O
and O
maps O
upon O
the O
table O
told O
of O
their O
morning's O
employment O
having O
been O
the O
same O
as O
usual O
. O
Herbert S-PERSON
was O
earnestly O
endeavoring O
to O
speak O
comfort O
, O
but O
evidently O
without O
success O
| | O
and O
Mary S-PERSON
was O
in O
general O
so O
controlled O
, O
that O
her O
present O
grief O
betrayed O
some O
very O
much O
heavier O
trial O
than O
usual O
. O
" O
Is O
your O
mother O
ill O
, O
my O
dear O
Mary S-PERSON
? O
What O
can O
have O
happened O
to O
agitate O
you O
so O
painfully O
? O
" O
she O
inquired O
, O
as O
at O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
sound O
of O
her O
voice O
the O
poor O
girl O
sprung O
toward O
her O
, O
and O
tried O
to O
say O
how O
very O
glad O
she O
was O
that O
she O
had O
come O
just O
then O
| | O
but O
the O
words O
were O
inarticulate O
from O
sobs O
| | O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
desiring O
Edward S-PERSON
to O
amuse O
himself O
in O
the O
garden O
, O
made O
her O
sit O
down O
by O
her O
, O
and O
told O
her O
not O
to O
attempt O
to O
check O
her O
tears O
, O
but O
to O
let O
them O
have O
free O
vent O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes E-TIME
, O
and O
then O
to O
try O
and O
tell O
her O
what O
had O
occurred O
. O
It O
was O
a O
very O
sad O
tale O
for O
a O
child O
to O
tell O
, O
and O
as O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
previous O
knowledge O
enabled O
her O
to O
gather O
more O
from O
it O
than O
Mary's S-PERSON
broken O
narrative O
permitted O
, O
we O
will O
give O
it O
in O
our O
own O
words O
. O
Mr. O
Greville S-PERSON
had O
been O
at O
home O
for O
a B-DATE
month E-DATE
, O
a O
quarter O
of O
which O
time O
the O
good O
humor O
which O
some O
unusually O
successful O
bets O
had O
excited O
, O
lasted O
| | O
but O
no O
longer O
. O
His O
amusement O
then O
consisted O
, O
as O
usual O
, O
in O
trying O
every O
method O
to O
annoy O
and O
irritate O
his O
wife O
, O
and O
in O
endeavoring O
to O
make O
his O
son O
exactly O
like O
himself O
. O
Young O
as O
the O
boy O
was O
— O
scarcely O
twelve O
— O
he O
took O
him O
to O
scenes O
of O
riot O
and O
feasting O
, O
which O
the O
society O
of O
some O
boon O
companions O
, O
unhappily O
near O
neighbors O
, O
permitted O
| | O
and O
though O
Alfred's S-PERSON
cheek O
became O
pale O
, O
his O
eye O
haggard O
, O
and O
his O
temper O
uneven O
, O
his O
initiation O
was O
fraught O
with O
such O
a O
new O
species O
of O
excitement O
and O
pleasure O
, O
that O
it O
rejoiced O
and O
encouraged O
his O
father O
in O
the O
same O
measure O
as O
it O
agonized O
his O
mother O
, O
and O
, O
for O
her O
sake O
, O
poor O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
That O
morning O
Alfred S-PERSON
had O
declared O
his O
intention O
of O
visiting O
a O
large O
fair O
, O
which O
, O
with O
some O
races O
of O
but O
ill O
repute O
, O
from O
the O
bad O
company O
they O
collected O
, O
was O
to O
be O
held O
at O
a O
neighboring O
town O
, O
and O
told O
his O
father O
to O
prepare O
for O
a O
large O
demand O
on O
his O
cash O
, O
as O
he O
meant O
to O
try O
his O
hand O
at O
all O
the O
varieties O
of O
gaming O
which O
the O
scene O
presented O
. O
Mr. O
Greville S-PERSON
laughed O
heartily O
at O
what O
he O
called O
the O
boy's O
right O
spirit O
, O
and O
promised O
him O
all O
he O
required O
| | O
but O
there O
was O
a O
quivering O
on O
her O
mother's O
lip O
, O
a O
deadly O
paleness O
on O
her O
cheek O
, O
that O
spoke O
volumes O
of O
suffering O
to O
the O
heart O
of O
the O
observant O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
who O
sat O
trembling O
beside O
her O
. O
Still O
Mrs. O
Greville S-PERSON
did O
not O
speak O
till O
her O
husband O
left O
the O
room O
| | O
but O
then O
, O
as O
Alfred S-PERSON
was O
about O
to O
follow O
him O
, O
she O
caught O
hold O
of O
his O
hand O
, O
and O
implored O
him O
, O
with O
such O
a O
tone O
and O
look O
of O
agony O
, O
only O
to O
listen O
to O
her O
, O
for O
her O
sake O
to O
give O
up O
his O
intended O
pleasure O
| | O
that O
, O
almost O
frightened O
by O
an O
emotion O
which O
in O
his O
gentle O
mother O
he O
had O
scarcely O
ever O
seen O
, O
and O
suddenly O
remembering O
that O
he O
had O
lately O
been O
indeed O
most O
unkind O
and O
neglectful O
to O
her O
, O
he O
threw O
his O
arms O
round O
her O
neck O
, O
and O
promised O
with O
tears O
that O
if O
it O
gave O
her O
so O
much O
pain O
, O
he O
would O
not O
go O
| | O
and O
so O
sincere O
was O
his O
feeling O
at O
the O
moment O
that O
, O
had O
there O
been O
no O
tempter O
near O
, O
he O
would O
, O
in O
all O
probability O
, O
have O
kept O
his O
word O
. O
But O
the O
moment O
Mr. O
Greville S-PERSON
heard O
from O
his O
son O
his O
change O
of O
intention O
and O
its O
cause O
, O
he O
so O
laughed O
at O
his O
ridiculous O
folly O
, O
so O
sneered O
at O
his O
want O
of O
spirit O
in O
preferring O
his O
mother's O
whims O
to O
his O
father's O
pleasures O
, O
that O
, O
as O
could O
not O
fail O
to O
be O
the O
case O
, O
every O
better O
feeling O
fled O
. O
This O
ought O
to O
have O
been O
enough O
| | O
but O
it O
was O
too O
good O
an O
opportunity O
to O
vent O
his O
ill O
- O
temper O
on O
his O
wife O
, O
to O
be O
neglected O
. O
He O
sought O
her O
, O
where O
she O
was O
superintending O
Mary's S-PERSON
lessons O
, O
and O
for O
nearly B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour E-TIME
poured O
upon O
her O
the O
most O
fearful O
abuse O
and O
cutting O
taunts O
, O
ending O
by O
declaring O
that O
all O
the O
good O
she O
had O
done O
by O
her O
saintly O
eloquence O
was O
to O
banish O
her O
son O
from O
her O
presence O
, O
whenever O
he O
left O
home O
, O
as O
in O
future O
Alfred S-PERSON
should O
be O
his O
companion O
| | O
and O
that O
he O
should O
begin O
that O
very O
day O
. O
Mrs. O
Greville S-PERSON
neither O
moved O
nor O
spoke O
in O
reply O
| | O
and O
the O
expression O
of O
her O
countenance O
was O
so O
sternly O
calm O
, O
that O
poor O
Mary S-PERSON
felt O
as O
if O
she O
dared O
not O
give O
way O
to O
the O
emotion O
with O
which O
her O
heart O
was O
bursting O
. O
Mr. O
Greville S-PERSON
left O
the O
room O
, O
and O
they O
heard O
him O
peremptorily O
desire O
the O
housekeeper O
to O
put O
up O
some O
of O
Master O
Alfred's O
clothes O
. O
In O
a O
perfectly O
composed O
voice O
Mrs. O
Greville S-PERSON
desired O
Mary S-PERSON
to O
proceed O
with O
the O
exercise O
she O
was O
writing O
, O
and O
emulating O
her O
firmness O
, O
she O
tried O
to O
obey O
. O
Fortunately O
her O
task O
was O
writing O
, O
for O
to O
have O
spoken O
or O
read O
aloud O
would O
, O
she O
felt O
, O
have O
been O
impossible O
. O
So O
full B-TIME
half I-TIME
an I-TIME
hour E-TIME
passed O
, O
and O
then O
hasty O
footsteps O
were O
heard O
in O
the O
hall O
, O
and O
the O
joyous O
voice O
of O
Alfred S-PERSON
exclaiming O
— O
" O
Let O
me O
wish O
mamma O
and O
Mary S-PERSON
good O
- O
by O
, O
papa O
. O
" O
" O
I O
have O
not O
another O
moment O
to O
spare O
, O
" O
was O
the O
reply O
. O
" O
You O
have O
kept O
me O
long O
enough O
, O
and O
must O
be O
quicker O
next O
time O
| | O
come O
along O
, O
my O
boy O
. O
" O
The O
rapid O
tread O
of O
horses' O
hoofs O
speedily O
followed O
the O
sullen O
clang O
with O
which O
the O
hall O
- O
door O
closed O
, O
and O
as O
rapidly O
faded O
away O
in O
the O
distance O
. O
With O
an O
irresistible O
impulse O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
raised O
her O
eyes O
to O
her O
mother's O
face O
| | O
a O
bright O
red O
flush O
had O
risen O
to O
her O
temples O
, O
but O
her O
lips O
were O
perfectly O
colorless O
, O
and O
her O
hand O
tightly O
pressed O
her O
heart O
| | O
but O
this O
only O
lasted O
a O
minute O
, O
for O
the O
next O
she O
had O
fallen O
quite O
senseless O
on O
the O
floor O
. O
Her O
poor O
child O
hung O
over O
her O
almost O
paralyzed O
with O
terror O
, O
and O
so O
long O
did O
the O
faint O
last O
, O
that O
she O
was O
conveyed O
to O
her O
own O
room O
, O
partially O
undressed O
, O
and O
laid O
on O
her O
bed O
before O
she O
at O
all O
recovered O
. O
A O
brief O
while O
she O
had O
clasped O
Mary S-PERSON
to O
her O
bosom O
, O
as O
if O
in O
her O
was O
indeed O
her O
only O
earthly O
comfort O
, O
and O
then O
in O
a O
faint O
voice O
desired O
to O
be O
left O
quite O
alone O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
had O
flung O
herself O
on O
the O
neck O
of O
the O
sympathizing O
Herbert B-PERSON
Hamilton E-PERSON
( O
who O
had O
arrived O
just O
in O
the O
confusion O
attendant O
on O
Mrs. O
Greville's S-PERSON
unusual O
illness O
) O
, O
and O
wept O
there O
in O
all O
the O
uncontrolled O
violence O
of O
early O
sorrow O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
remained O
some O
time O
with O
her O
afflicted O
friend O
, O
for O
so O
truly O
could O
she O
sympathize O
with O
her O
, O
that O
her O
society O
brought O
with O
it O
the O
only O
solace O
Mrs. O
Greville S-PERSON
was O
capable O
of O
realizing O
from O
human O
companionship O
. O
" O
It O
is O
not O
for O
myself O
I O
murmur O
, O
" O
were O
the O
only O
words O
that O
in O
that O
painful O
interview O
might O
have O
even O
seemed O
like O
complaint O
| | O
" O
but O
for O
my O
poor O
child O
. O
How O
is O
her O
fragile O
frame O
and O
gentle O
spirit O
to O
endure O
through O
trials O
such O
as O
these O
| | O
oh O
, O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
to O
lose O
both O
, O
and O
through O
their O
father O
! O
" O
And O
difficult O
indeed O
did O
it O
seem O
to O
realize O
the O
cause O
of O
such O
a O
terrible O
dispensation O
| | O
but O
happily O
for O
Mrs. O
Greville S-PERSON
, O
she O
could O
still O
look O
up O
in O
love O
and O
trust O
, O
even O
when O
below O
all O
of O
comfort O
as O
of O
joy O
seemed O
departed O
| | O
and O
in O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
days E-DATE
she O
was O
enabled O
to O
resume O
her O
usual O
avocations O
, O
and O
, O
by O
an O
assumption O
of O
cheerfulness O
and O
constant O
employment O
, O
to O
restore O
some O
degree O
of O
peace O
and O
happiness O
to O
her O
child O
. O
Neither O
Herbert S-PERSON
nor O
Edward S-PERSON
seemed O
inclined O
to O
converse O
on O
their O
walk O
home O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
was O
so O
engrossed O
in O
thought O
for O
Mrs. O
Greville S-PERSON
, O
that O
she O
did O
not O
feel O
disposed O
to O
speak O
either O
. O
Herbert S-PERSON
was O
contrasting O
his O
father O
with O
Mary's S-PERSON
, O
and O
with O
such O
a O
vivid O
sense O
of O
his O
own O
happier O
lot O
, O
that O
he O
felt O
almost O
oppressed O
with O
the O
thought O
, O
he O
was O
not O
, O
he O
never O
could O
be O
, O
grateful O
enough O
| | O
for O
, O
what O
had O
he O
done O
to O
be O
so O
much O
more O
blessed O
? O
And O
when O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
who O
, O
wondering O
at O
their O
long O
absence O
, O
had O
come O
out O
to O
meet O
them O
, O
put O
his O
arm O
affectionately O
round O
him O
, O
and O
asked O
him O
what O
could O
possibly O
make O
him O
look O
so O
pale O
and O
pensive O
, O
the O
boy's O
excited O
feelings O
completely O
overpowered O
him O
. O
He O
buried O
his O
face O
on O
his O
father's O
shoulder O
, O
and O
burst O
into O
tears O
| | O
and O
then O
leaving O
his O
mother O
to O
explain O
it O
, O
for O
he O
felt O
quite O
sure O
she O
could O
, O
without O
his O
telling O
her O
, O
darted O
away O
and O
never O
stopped O
till O
he O
found O
himself O
in O
the O
sanctuary O
of O
his O
own O
room O
| | O
and O
there O
he O
remained O
, O
trying O
to O
calm O
himself O
by O
earnest O
thought O
and O
almost O
unconscious O
prayer O

the O
dinner O

summoned O
him O
to O
rejoin O
his O
family O

he O
did O
, O
quiet O
and O
gentle O
, O

cheerful O
, O
as O
usual O
. O
Edward S-PERSON
did O
not O
forget O
the O
thoughts O
of O
the O
morning O
, O
but O
the O
struggles O
so O
to O
subdue O
his O
pride O
as O
to O
apologize O
to O
Robert S-PERSON
, O
seemed O
very O
much O
more O
difficult O
when O
he O
was O
no O
longer O
hearing O
his O
aunt's O
earnest O
words O

but O
he O
did O
conquer O
himself O
, O
and O
the O
fond O
approving O
look O
, O
with O
which O
he O
was O
rewarded O
, O
gave O
him O
such O
a O
glowing O
feeling O
of O
pleasure O
, O
as O
almost O
to O
lessen O
the O
pain O

Mrs. O

accompanied O
by O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
called O
at O
Moorlands S-LOC
. O
Cecil B-PERSON
Grahame E-PERSON
was O
playing O
in O
the O
garden O
, O
and O
Percy S-PERSON
remained O
with O
him O
, O
his O
good O
- O
nature O
often O
making O
him O
a O
companion O
, O
though O
there O
was O
nearly O
six S-CARDINAL
years' O
difference O
in O
their O
age O

" O
Are O
you O
going O
to O
T O
— O
on O
Thursday S-DATE
, O
Percy S-PERSON
? O
There O
will O
be O
such O
fine O
doings O
. O
Races O
and O
the O
county O
fair O
, O
and O
wild O
beasts O
and O
shows O
, O
and O
every O
thing O
delightful O

of O
course O
, O
you O
will O
go O
? O
" O
" O
I O
do O
not O
think O
it O
at O
all O
likely O
, O
" O
replied O
young O
Hamilton S-PERSON
. O
" O
No O
! O
" O
repeated O
Cecil S-PERSON
, O
much O
astonished O
. O
" O
Why O
, O
I O
was O
only O
saying O
the O
other O
day O
how O
much O
I O
should O
like O
to O
be O
as O
old O
as O
you O
are O
| | O
it O
must O
be O
so O
delightful O
to O
be O
one's O
own O
master O
. O
" O
" O
I O
do O
not O
consider O
myself O
my O
own O
master O
yet O
, O
Cecil S-PERSON
. O
Sometimes O
I O
wish O
I O
were O
| | O
at O
others O
, O
I O
think O
I O
am O
much O
better O
as O
I O
am O
. O
And O
, O
as O
for O
this O
fair O
, O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
will O
be O
back O
to O
- O
morrow O
, O
so O
there O
is O
no O
chance O
of O
my O
going O
. O
" O
" O
Why O
is O
there O
no O
such O
thing O
as O
the O
possibility O
of O
a O
holiday O
, O
Percy S-PERSON
? O
" O
replied O
Cecil S-PERSON
, O
with O
great O
glee O
| | O
" O
or O
perhaps O
, O
" O
he O
added O
, O
laughing O
, O
" O
your O
papa O
is O
like O
mine O
, O
and O
does O
not O
allow O
such O
freaks O

thinks O
it O
wrong O
to O
go O
to O
such O
places O
, O
acting O
against O
morality O
, O
and O
such O
out O
of O
the O
way O
ideas O
. O
" O
" O
Are O
these O
Mr. O
Grahame's S-PERSON
opinions O
? O
" O
inquired O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
almost O
sternly O
. O
" O
Why O
ye O
— O
yes O
— O
why O
do O
you O
look O
at O
me O
so O
, O
Percy S-PERSON
? O
I O
am O
sure O
I O
said O
no O
harm O
| | O
I O
only O
repeated O
what O
I O
have O
heard O
mamma O
say O
continually O
. O
" O
" O
That O
is O
not O
the O
very O
least O
excuse O
for O
your O
disrespect O
to O
your O
father O
| | O
and O
if O
he O
think O
thus O
, O
I O
wonder O
you O
should O
talk O
of O
going O
to O
the O
races O
| | O
you O
can O
not O
have O
his O
permission O
. O
" O
" O
Oh O
, O
but O
mamma O
has O
promised O
if O
I O
am O
a O
good O
boy O
till O
then O
and O
she O
can O
manage O
it O
, O
I O
shall O
go O
| | O
for O
she O
can O
not O
see O
any O
harm O
in O
it O
. O
And O
as O
for O
waiting O
for O
papa's O
permission O
— O
if O
I O
did O
, O
I O
should O
never O
go O
any O
where O
. O
He O
is O
so O
unkind O
, O
that O
I O
am O
always O
afraid O
of O
speaking O
or O
even O
playing O
, O
when O
he O
is O
in O
the O
room O
. O
" O
" O
You O
are O
a O
silly O
boy O
, O
Cecil S-PERSON
, O
" O
replied O
young O
Hamilton S-PERSON
| | O
" O
Believe O
me O
, O
you O
do O
not O
know O
your O
best O
friend O
. O
I O
should O
be O
very O
sorry O
to O
feel O
thus O
toward O
my O
father O
. O
" O
" O
Oh O
! O
but O
yours O
and O
mine O
are O
very O
different O
sort O
of O
people O
. O
Your O
papa O
never O
punishes O
you O
, O
or O
refuses O
you O
his O
permission O
, O
when O
you O
wish O
particularly O
to O
do O
any O
thing O
, O
or O
go O
any O
where O
. O
" O
" O
If O
papa O
thinks O
my O
wishes O
foolish O
, O
or O
liable O
to O
lead O
me O
into O
error O
, O
he O
does O
refuse O
me O
without O
scruple O
, O
Cecil S-PERSON
. O
And O
though O
I O
am O
old O
enough O
now O
, O
I O
hope O
, O
so O
to O
conduct O
myself O
as O
to O
avoid O
actual O
punishment O
: O
when O
I O
was O
as O
young O
as O
you O
are O
, O
papa O
very O
frequently O
punished O
me O
, O
both O
for O
my O
violence O
and O
pride O
. O
" O
" O
But O
then O
he O
was O
kind O
to O
you O
afterward O
. O
Now O
I O
should O
not O
so O
much O
mind O
papa's O
severity O
when O
I O
am O
naughty O
, O
if O
he O
would O
only O
be O
kind O
, O
or O
take O
some O
notice O
of O
me O
when O
I O
am O
good O
. O
But O
has O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
told O
you O
not O
to O
go O
to O
the O
races O
? O
" O
" O
Not O
exactly O
: O
he O
has O
merely O
said O
he O
thinks O
it O
a O
day O
most O
unprofitably O
wasted O
| | O
and O
that O
the O
gambling O
and O
excesses O
, O
always O
the O
attendant O
of O
races O
, O
are O
not O
fit O
scenes O
for O
young O
persons O
. O
Were O
I O
to O
take O
my O
horse O
and O
go O
, O
he O
would O
not O
, O
perhaps O
, O
be O
actually O
displeased O
, O
as O
I O
am O
old O
enough O
now O
, O
he O
says O
, O
in O
some O
things O
, O
to O
judge O
for O
myself O
| | O
but O
I O
should O
be O
acting O
against O
his O
principles O
, O
which O
, O
just O
now O
, O
I O
am O
not O
inclined O
to O
do O
, O
for O
I O
am O
sure O
to O
suffer O
from O
it O
afterward O
. O
" O
" O
Well O
, O
all O
I O
can O
say O
, O
is O
, O
that O
when O
I O
am O
as O
old O
as O
you O
are O
, O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
I O
shall O
certainly O
consider O
myself O
under O
no O
one O
. O
I O
hope O
I O
shall O
be O
at O
Eton S-GPE
by O
that O
time O
, O
and O
then O
we O
shall O
see O
if O
Cecil B-PERSON
Grahame E-PERSON
has O
not O
some O
spirit O
in O
him O
. O
I O
would O
not O
be O
tied O
down O
to O
Oakwood S-GPE
, O
and O
to O
Mr. O
Howard's S-PERSON
humdrum O
lessons O
, O
as O
you O
are O
, O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
for O
worlds O
. O
" O
" O
Take O
care O
that O
Cecil B-PERSON
Grahame's E-PERSON
spirit O
does O
not O
effervesce O
so O
much O
, O
as O
to O
make O
him O
, O
when O
at O
Eton S-GPE
, O
wish O
himself O
back O
at O
Moorlands S-LOC
, O
" O
replied O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
laughing O
heartily O
at O
his O
young O
companion's O
grotesque O
attempts O
at O
self O
- O
consequence O
, O
by O
placing O
his O
cap O
dandily O
on O
his O
head O
, O
flourishing O
his O
cane O
, O
and O
trying O
to O
make O
himself O
look O
taller O
. O
Cecil S-PERSON
took O
his O
laugh O
, O
however O
, O
in O
good O
part O
, O
and O
they O
continued O
in O
amicable O
conversation O
till O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
summoned O
Percy S-PERSON
to O
attend O
her O
home O
. O
Our O
readers O
have O
, O
perhaps O
, O
discovered O
that O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
this B-DATE
day E-DATE
was O
not O
quite O
as O
lively O
as O
usual O
. O
If O
they O
have O
not O
his O
mother O
did O
| | O
for O
, O
strange O
to O
say O
, O
he O
walked O
by O
her O
side O
silent O
and O
dispirited O
. O
His O
thoughtlessness O
very O
often O
led O
him O
into O
error O
and O
its O
disagreeable O
consequences O
| | O
and O
, O
fearing O
this O
had O
again O
been O
the O
case O
, O
she O
playfully O
inquired O
the O
cause O
of O
his O
most O
unusual O
abstraction O
. O
He O
colored O
, O
but O
evaded O
the O
question O
, O
and O
successfully O
roused O
himself O
to O
talk O
. O
His O
mother O
was O
not O
anxious O
, O
for O
she O
had O
such O
perfect O
confidence O
in O
him O
, O
that O
she O
know O
if O
he O
had O
committed O
error O
, O
he O
would O
redeem O
it O
, O
and O
that O
his O
own O
good O
feelings O
and O
high O
principles O
would O
prevent O
its O
recurrence O
. O
It O
so O
happened O
, O
however O
, O
that O
young O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
by O
a O
series O
of O
rather O
imprudent O
actions O
, O
had O
plunged O
himself O
into O
such O
a O
very O
unusual O
and O
disagreeable O
position O
, O
as O
not O
very O
well O
to O
know O
how O
to O
extricate O
himself O
from O
it O
, O
without O
a O
full O
confession O
to O
his O
father O
| | O
which O
, O
daringly O
brave O
as O
in O
general O
he O
was O
, O
he O
felt O
almost O
as O
if O
he O
really O
had O
not O
the O
courage O
to O
make O
. O
One S-CARDINAL
of O
Mr. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
most O
imperative O
commands O
was O
, O
that O
his O
sons O
should O
never O
incur O
a O
debt O
, O
and O
, O
to O
prevent O
the O
temptation O
, O
their O
monthly S-DATE
allowance O
was O
an O
ample O
one O
, O
and O
fully O
permitted O
any O
recreative O
indulgences O
they O
might O
desire O
. O
Now O
Percy S-PERSON
was O
rather O
inclined O
to O
extravagance O
, O
from O
thoughtlessness O
and O
a O
profuse O
generosity O
, O
which O
had O
often O
caused O
him O
such O
annoyance O
as O
to O
make O
him O
resolve O
again O
and O
again O
to O
follow O
his O
father's O
advice O
, O
and O
keep O
some O
accounts O
of O
his O
expenditure O
, O
as O
a O
slight O
check O
on O
himself O
. O
The O
admiration O
for O
beauty O
in O
the O
fine O
arts O
, O
which O
his O
mother O
had O
so O
sedulously O
cultivated O
, O
had O
had O
only O
one S-CARDINAL
bad O
effect O
| | O
and O
that O
was O
that O
his O
passion O
for O
prints O
and O
paintings O
, O
and O
illustrated O
and O
richly O
- O
bound O
volumes O
, O
sometimes O
carried O
him O
beyond O
bounds O
, O
and O
very O
often O
occasioned O
regret O
, O
that O
he O
had O
not O
examined O
the O
letter O
- O
press O
of O
such O
works O
, O
as O
well O
as O
their O
engravings O
and O
bindings O
. O
He O
had O
given O
orders O
to O
Mr. O
Harris S-PERSON
, O
a O
large O
fancy O
stationer O
, O
librarian O
, O
and O
publisher O
of O
T O
— O
, O
to O
procure O
for O
him O
a O
set O
of O
engravings O
, O
whose O
very O
interesting O
subjects O
and O
beautiful O
workmanship O
, O
Mr. O
Grahame S-PERSON
had O
so O
vividly O
described O
to O
him O
, O
that O
young O
Hamilton S-PERSON
felt O
to O
do O
without O
them O
till O
his O
father O
or O
he O
himself O
should O
visit O
the O
metropolis O
, O
and O
so O
judge O
of O
their O
worth O
themselves O
, O
was O
quite O
impossible O
. O
The O
order O
was O
given O
without O
the O
least O
regard O
to O
price O
. O
They O
arrived O
at O
the B-DATE
end I-DATE
of I-DATE
the I-DATE
month E-DATE
, O
and O
the O
young O
gentleman O
, O
to O
his O
extreme O
astonishment O
, O
discovered O
that O
his O
month's O
allowance O
had O
been O
so O
expended O
, O
as O
not O
to O
leave O
him O
a B-CARDINAL
half I-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
quarter E-CARDINAL
of O
the O
necessary O
sum O

Mr. O
Harris S-PERSON
had O
had O
great O
difficulty O
in O
procuring O
the O
prints O
, O
and O
of O
course O
he O
was O
bound O
in O
honor O
to O
take O
them O
. O
If O
he O
waited O
till O
he O
could O
pay O
for O
them O
, O
he O
must O
sacrifice O
the O
whole O
of O
one S-CARDINAL
month's O
allowance O
, O
and O
then O
how O
could O
he O
keep O
free O
from O
debt O
till O
the O
next O
? O
As O
for O
applying O
to O
his O
father O
, O
he O
shrank O
from O
it O
with O
actual O
pain O
. O
How O
could O
he O
ask O
his O
ever O
kind O
and O
indulgent O
parent O
to O
discharge O
a O
debt O
incurred O
by O
such O
a O
thoughtless O
act O
of O
unnecessary O
extravagance O
? O
Mr. O
Harris S-PERSON
made O
very O
light O
of O
it O
, O
declaring O
that O
, O
if O
Mr. O
Percy S-PERSON
did O
not O
pay O
him O
for O
a O
twelvemonth O
, O
it O
was O
of O
no O
consequence O

he O
would O
trust O
him O
for O
any O
sum O
or O
any O
time O
he O
liked O
. O
But O
to O
make O
no O
attempt O
to O
liquidate O
his O
debt O
was O
as O
impossible O
as O
to O
speak O
to O
his O
father O
. O
No O
, O
after O
a O
violent O
struggle O
with O
his O
pride O
, O
which O
did O
not O
at O
all O
like O
the O
idea O
of O
betraying O
his O
inability O
to O
pay O
the O
whole O
, O
or O
of O
asking O
a O
favor O
of O
Mr. O
Harris S-PERSON
, O
he O
agreed O
to O
pay O
his O
debt O
by O
installments O
, O
and O
so O
in O
two B-DATE
or I-DATE
three I-DATE
months E-DATE
, O
at O
the O
very O
latest O
, O
discharge O
the O
whole O
. O
One B-DATE
week E-DATE
afterward O
he O
received O
his O
month's O
allowance O
, O
and O
riding O
over O
directly O
to O
the O
town O
relieved O
his O
conscience O
of O
half S-CARDINAL
its O
load O
. O
To O
have O
only B-CARDINAL
half E-CARDINAL
his O
usual O
sum O
, O
however O
, O
for O
monthly S-DATE
expenditure O
caused O
him O
so O
many O
checks O
and O
annoyances O
as O
to O
make O
him O
hate O
the O
very O
sight O
of O
the O
prints O
whose O
possession O
he O
had O
so O
coveted O
, O
but O
he O
looked O
forward O
to O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
month E-DATE
to O
be O
free O
at O
least O
of O
Mr. O
Harris S-PERSON
. O
The O
idea O
of O
disobedience O
to O
his O
father O
in O
incurring O
a O
debt O
at O
all O
, O
causing O
him O
more O
annoyance O
than O
all O
the O
rest O
. O
Again O
the B-DATE
first I-DATE
day I-DATE
of I-DATE
the I-DATE
month E-DATE
came O
round O
, O
and O
putting O
the O
full O
sum O
required O
in O
his O
purse O
, O
he O
set O
off O
, O
but O
on O
his O
way O
encountered O
such O
a O
scene O
of O
distress O
, O
that O
every O
thought O
fled O
from O
his O
mind O
, O
except O
how O
to O
relieve O
it O
. O
He O
accompanied O
the O
miserable O
half S-CARDINAL
- O
famished O
man O
to O
a O
hut O
in O
which O
lay O
a O
seemingly O
dying O
woman O
with O
a O
new O
- O
born O
babe O
, O
and O
two S-CARDINAL
or O
three S-CARDINAL
small O
half O
- O
starved O
, O
half S-CARDINAL
- O
naked O
children O
— O
listened O
to O
their O
story O
, O
which O
was O
really O
one O
of O
truth O
and O
misfortune O
, O
not O
of O
whining O
deceit O
, O
poured O
the O
whole O
contents O
of O
his O
purse O
into O
their O
laps O
, O
and O
rode O
off O
to O
T O
— O
, O
to O
find O
not O
Mr. O
Harris S-PERSON
but O
Mr. O
Maitland S-PERSON
, O
and O
implore O
him O
to O
see O
what O
his O
skill O
would O
do O
for O
the O
poor O
woman O
. O
He O
encountered O
that O
gentleman O
at O
the O
outskirts O
of O
the O
town O
, O
told O
his O
story O
, O
and O
was O
so O
delighted O
at O
Mr. O
Maitland's S-PERSON
willing O
promise O
to O
go O
directly O
, O
and O
also O
to O
report O
the O
case O
to O
those O
who O
would O
relieve O
it O
, O
that O
he O
never O
thought O
of O
any O
thing O
else O
till O
he O
found O
himself O
directly O
opposite O
Mr. O
Harris's S-PERSON
shop O
, O
and O
his O
bounding O
heart O
sunk O
suddenly O
down O
, O
as O
impelled O
by O
a O
weight O
of O
lead O
. O
The O
conviction O
flashed O
upon O
him O
that O
he O
had O
been O
giving O
away O
money O
which O
was O
actually O
not O
his O
own O
| | O
and O
the O
deed O
which O
had O
been O
productive O
of O
so O
much O
internal O
happiness O
, O
now O
seemed O
to O
reproach O
and O
condemn O
him O
. O
He O
rode O
back O
without O
even O
seeking O
Mr. O
Harris S-PERSON
, O
for O
what O
could O
he O
tell O
him O
as O
the O
reason O
of O
his O
non-payment O
? O
Certainly O
not O
his O
having O
given O
it O
away O
. O
The O
first S-ORDINAL
of O
May S-DATE
, O
which O
was O
his O
birthday O
, O
he O
had O
been O
long O
engaged O
to O
spend O
with O
some O
young O
men O
and O
lads O
who O
were O
to O
have O
a O
grand O
game O
of O
cricket O
, O
a O
jovial O
dinner O
, O
an O
adjournment O
to O
some O
evening O
amusement O
, O
and O
, O
to O
conclude O
the O
day O
, O
a O
gay O
supper O
, O
with O
glees O
and O
songs O
. O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
had O
rather O
wished O
Percy S-PERSON
to O
leave O
the O
party O
after O
dinner O
, O
and O
had O
told O
him O
so O
, O
merely O
, O
however O
, O
as O
a O
preference O
, O
not O
a O
command O
, O
but O
giving O
him O
permission O
to O
use O
his O
own O
discretion O
. O
Percy S-PERSON
knew O
there O
would O
be O
several O
expenses O
attendant O
on O
the B-DATE
day E-DATE
, O
but O
still O
he O
had O
promised O
so O
long O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
party O
, O
which O
all O
had O
declared O
would O
be O
nothing O
without O
him O
, O
and O
his O
own O
inclinations O
so O
urged O
him O
to O
join O
it O
, O
that O
it O
seemed O
to O
him O
utterly O
impossible O
to O
draw O
back O
, O
especially O
as O
he O
could O
give O
no O
excuse O
for O
doing O
so O
. O
How O
could O
he O
say O
that O
he O
could O
not O
afford O
it O
? O
when O
he O
was O
, O
or O
ought O
to O
have O
been O
, O
nearly O
the O
richest O
of O
the O
party O
| | O
and O
what O
would O
his O
father O
think O
? O
He O
went O
. O
The O
day O
was O
thoroughly O
delightful O
, O
and O
so O
exciting O
, O
that O
though O
he O
had O
started O
from O
home O
with O
the O
intention O
of O
leaving O
them O
after O
dinner O
, O
he O
could O
not O
resist O
the O
pleadings O
of O
his O
companions O
and O
his O
own O
wishes O
, O
and O
remained O
. O
At O
supper O
alone O
excitement O
and O
revelry O
seemed O
to O
have O
gained O
the O
upper O
hand O
, O
and O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
though O
steady O
in O
entirely O
abstaining O
from O
all O
excess O
, O
was O
not O
quite O
so O
guarded O
as O
usual O
. O
A O
clergyman O
had O
lately O
appeared O
at O
T B-ORG
— E-ORG
, O
whose O
appearance O
, O
manners O
, O
and O
opinions O
had O
given O
more O
than O
usual O
food O
for O
gossip O
, O
and O
much O
uncharitableness O
. O
His O
cloth O
indeed O
ought O
to O
have O
protected O
him O
, O
but O
it O
rather O
increased O
the O
satire O
, O
sarcasm O
, O
and O
laughter O
which O
he O
excited O
. O
He O
was O
brought O
forward O
by O
the O
thoughtless O
youths O
of O
Percy's B-ORG
party E-ORG
, O
quizzed O
unmercifully O
, O
made O
the O
object O
of O
some O
clever O
caricatures O
and O
satires O
, O
and O
though O
young O
Hamilton S-PERSON
at O
first S-ORDINAL
kept O
aloof O
, O
he O
could O
not O
resist O
the O
contagion O
. O
He O
dashed O
off O
about B-CARDINAL
half I-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
a- I-CARDINAL
dozen E-CARDINAL
verses O
of O
such O
remarkably O
witty O
and O
clever O
point O
, O
that O
they O
were O
received O
with O
roars O
of O
applause O
, O
and O
an O
unanimous O
request O
for O
distribution O
| | O
but O
this O
he O
positively O
refused O
, O
and O
put O
them O
up O
with O
one S-CARDINAL
or O
two S-CARDINAL
other O
poems O
of O
more O
innocent O
wit O
, O
in O
which O
he O
was O
fond O
of O
indulging O
, O
into O
his O
pocket O
. O
The O
day O
closed O
, O
and O
the O
next O
morning O
brought O
with O
it O
so O
many O
regrets O
, O
and O
such O
a O
confused O
recollection O
of O
the O
very O
unusual O
excitement O
of O
the O
previous O
evening O
, O
that O
he O
was O
glad O
to O
dismiss O
the O
subject O
from O
his O
mind O
, O
and O
threw O
his O
satire O
, O
as O
he O
believed O
, O
into O
the O
fire O
. O
In O
fact O
, O
he O
was O
so O
absorbed O
with O
the O
disagreeable O
conviction O
that O
he O
could O
only O
pay O
Mr. O
Harris S-PERSON
a B-CARDINAL
third E-CARDINAL
of O
his O
remaining O
debt O
, O
trifling O
as O
in O
reality O
it O
was O
, O
that O
he O
thought O
of O
nothing O
else O
. O
Now O
Mr. O
Harris S-PERSON
was O
the O
editor O
and O
publisher O
of O
rather O
a O
clever O
weekly S-DATE
paper O
, O
and O
Percy S-PERSON
happened O
to O
be O
in O
his O
parlor O
waiting O
to O
speak O
to O
him O
, O
while O
he O
was O
paying O
a O
contribution O
. O
" O
I O
wish O
my O
head O
were O
clever O
enough O
to O
get O
out O
of O
your O
debt O
in O
that O
comfortable O
way O
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
half O
laughing O
, O
as O
the O
gentleman O
left O
them O
together O
. O
" O
I O
wish O
all O
my O
customers O
were O
as O
desirous O
of O
paying O
their O
large O
debts O
as O
you O
are O
your O
small O
ones O
, O
" O
was O
Mr. O
Harris's S-PERSON
reply O
. O
" O
But O
I O
have O
heard O
something O
of O
your O
clever O
verses O
, O
Mr. O
Percy S-PERSON
| | O
if O
you O
will O
let O
me O
see O
some O
, O
I O
really O
may O
be O
able O
to O
oblige O
you O
, O
as O
you O
seem O
so O
very O
anxious O
to O
have O
nothing O
more O
to O
do O
with O
me O
— O
" O
" O
In O
the O
way O
of O
debt O
, O
not O
of O
purchases O
, O
Mr. O
Harris S-PERSON
| | O
and O
I O
assure O
you O
, O
I O
am O
not O
thinking O
so O
much O
about O
you O
, O
as O
of O
my O
own O
disobedience O
. O
I O
will O
lend O
you O
my O
papers O
, O
only O
you O
must O
give O
me O
your O
word O
not O
to O
publish O
them O
with O
my O
name O

" O
" O
They O
will O
not O
be O
worth O
so O
much O
, O
" O
replied O
Mr. O
Harris S-PERSON
, O
smiling O
. O
" O
Only O
let O
me O
feel O
they O
have O
helped O
to O
discharge O
my O
debt O

at O
least O
let O
me O
know O
how O
much O
more O
is O
wanted O
to O
do O
so O
, O
and O
I O
will O
worship O
the O
muses O
henceforth O

" O
replied O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
with O
almost O
his O
natural O
gayety O
, O
for O
he O
felt O
he O
wrote O
better O
verses O
than O
those O
Mr. O
Harris S-PERSON
had O
been O
so O
liberally O
paying O
for O
| | O
and O
the O
idea O
of O
feeling O
free O
again O
was O
so O
very O
delightful O
, O
that O
, O
after O
receiving O
Mr. O
Harris's S-PERSON
solemn O
promise O
not O
to O
betray O
his O
authorship O
, O
he O
galloped O
home O
, O
more O
happy O
than O
he O
had O
been O
for O
some B-DATE
days E-DATE
. O
Mr. O
Harris S-PERSON
had O
said O
he O
must O
have O
them O
that O
evening O
, O
and O
Robert S-PERSON
was O
leaving O
for O
the O
town O
, O
as O
his O
young O
master O
entered O
the O
house O
. O
He O
hastily O
put O
up O
his O
portfolio O
, O
and O
sent O
it O
off O
. O
His O
conscience O
was O
so O
perfectly O
free O
from O
keeping O
any O
thing O
that O
he O
afterward O
had O
cause O
to O
regret O
, O
that O
he O
did O
not O
think O
of O
looking O
them O
over O
, O
and O
great O
was O
his O
delight O
, O
when O
a O
few O
lines O
arrived O
from O
Mr. O
Harris S-PERSON
, O
speaking O
in O
the O
highest O
terms O
of O
his O
talent O
, O
and O
saying O
, O
that O
the O
set O
of O
verses O
he O
had O
selected O
, O
even O
without O
the O
attraction O
of O
his O
name O
, O
would O
entirely O
liquidate O
his O
trifling O

Percy S-PERSON
trod O
on O
air O
. O
He O
had O
resolved O
on O
waiting O
till O
the O
poem O
appeared O
, O
and O
then O
, O
as O
he O
really O
had O
discharged O
his O
debt O
, O
take O
courage O
and O
confess O
the O
whole O
to O
his O
father O
, O
for O
his O
idea O
of O
truth O
made O
him O
shrink O
from O
any O
farther O
concealment O
. O
He O
hoped O
and O
believed O
that O
his O
father O
would O
regard O
the O
pain O
and O
constant O
annoyance O
he O
had O
been O
enduring O
so O
long O
, O
as O
sufficient O
penalty O
for O
his O
disobedience O
, O
and O
after O
a O
time O
give O
him O
back O
the O
confidence O
, O
which O
he O
feared O
must O
at O
his O
first S-ORDINAL
confession O
be O
withdrawn O
. O
What O
, O
then O
, O
was O
his O
grief O
, O
his O
vexation O
, O
almost O
his O
despair O
, O
when O
he O
recognized O
in O
the O
poem O
selected O
, O
the O
verses O
he O
thought O
and O
believed O
he O
had O
burned O
the O
morning O
after O
they O
were O
written O
| | O
and O
which O
in O
print O
, O
and O
read O
by O
his O
sober O
self O
, O
seemed O
such O
a O
heartless O
, O
glaring O
, O
cruel O
insult O
, O
not O
only O
on O
a O
fellow O
- O
creature O
, O
but O
a O
minister O
of O
God O
, O
that O
he O
felt O
almost O
overwhelmed O
. O
What O
could O
he O
do O
? O
Mr. O
Harris S-PERSON
was O
not O
to O
blame O
, O
for O
he O
had O
made O
no O
reservation O
as O
to O
the O
contents O
of O
his O
portfolio O
. O
His O
name O
, O
indeed O
, O
was O
not O
to O
them O
, O
and O
only O
having O
been O
read O
lightly O
once O
to O
his O
companions O
of O
that O
hateful O
supper O
— O
for O
so O
he O
now O
felt O
it O
— O
almost O
all O
of O
whom O
were O
not O
perfectly O
sober O
, O
there O
was O
a O
chance O
of O
their O
never O
being O
recognized O
as O
his O
, O
and O
as O
their O
subject O
did O
not O
live O
near O
any O
town O
where O
the O
paper O
was O
likely O
to O
circulate O
, O
might O
never O
meet O
his O
eye O
. O
But O
all O
this O
was O
poor O
comfort O
. O
The O
paper O
was O
very O
seldom O
seen O
at O
Oakwood S-GPE
, O
but O
its O
contents O
were O
often O
spoken O
of O
before O
his O
parents O
, O
and O
how O
could O
he O
endure O
a O
reference O
to O
those O
verses O
, O
how O
bear O
this O
accumulation O
of O
concealment O
, O
and O
, O
as O
he O
felt O
, O
deceit O
, O
and O
all O
sprung O
from O
the O
one S-CARDINAL
thoughtless O
act O
of O
ordering O
an O
expensive O
and O
unnecessary O
indulgence O
, O
without O
sufficient O
consideration O
how O
it O
was O
to O
be O
paid O
. O
To O
tell O
his O
father O
, O
avow O
himself O
the O
author O
of O
such O
a O
satire O
, O
and O
on O
such O
a O
subject O
, O
he O
could O
not O
. O
Could O
he O
tell O
his O
mother O
, O
and O
implore O
her O
intercession O
? O
that O
seemed O
like O
a O
want O
of O
confidence O
in O
his O
father O
— O
no O
— O
if O
he O
ever O
could O
gain O
courage O
to O
confess O
it O
, O
it O
should O
be O
to O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
alone O
| | O
but O
the O
more O
he O
thought O
, O
the O
more O
, O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
, O
his O
courage O
failed O
. O
It O
was O
only O
the O
day O
before O
his O
visit O
to O
Lady B-PERSON
Helen's E-PERSON
that O
he O
had O
discovered O
this O
accumulation O
of O
misfortune O
, O
and O
therefore O
it O
was O
not O
much O
wonder O
he O
was O
so O
dispirited O
. O
Two B-DATE
days E-DATE
afterward O
Herbert S-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
blushing O
cheek O
and O
very O
timid O
voice O
, O
asked O
his O
father O
to O
grant O
him O
a O
great O
favor O
. O
He O
was O
almost O
afraid O
to O
ask O
it O
, O
he O
said O
, O
but O
he O
hoped O
and O
believed O
his O
parent O
would O
trust O
his O
assurance O
that O
it O
was O
for O
nothing O
improper O
. O
It O
was O
that O
he O
might O
be O
from O
home O
next B-DATE
day E-DATE
unattended O
for O
several B-TIME
hours E-TIME
. O
He O
should O
go O
on O
horseback O
, O
but O
he O
was O
so O
accustomed O
to O
ride O
, O
and O
his O
horse O
was O
so O
steady O
, O
he O
hoped O
he O
might O
be O
allowed O
to O
go O
alone O
. O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
looked O
very O
much O
surprised O
, O
as O
did O
all O
present O
. O
That O
the O
quiet O
, O
studious O
Herbert S-PERSON
should O
wish O
to O
give O
up O
his O
favorite O
pursuits O
, O
so O
soon O
too O
after O
Mr. O
Howard's S-PERSON
return O
, O
and O
go O
on O
what O
appeared O
such O
a O
mysterious O
excursion O
, O
was O
something O
so O
extraordinary O
, O
that O
various O
expressions O
of O
surprise O
broke O
from O
his O
sisters O
and O
Edward S-PERSON
. O
Percy S-PERSON
did O
look O
up O
but O
made O
no O
observation O
. O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
only O
paused O
, O
however O
, O
to O
consult O
his O
wife's O
face O
and O
then O
replied O
— O
" O
You O
certainly O
have O
mystified O
us O
, O
my O
dear O
boy O
| | O
but O
I O
freely O
grant O
you O
my O
consent O
, O
and O
if O
I O
can O
read O
your O
mother's O
face O
aright O
, O
hers O
is O
not O
far O
distant O
. O
You O
are O
now O
nearly O
fifteen S-DATE
, O
and O
never O
once O
from O
your O
birth O
has O
your O
conduct O
given O
me O
an O
hour's O
pain O
or O
uneasiness O
| | O
I O
have O
therefore O
quite O
sufficient O
confidence O
in O
your O
integrity O
and O
steadiness O
to O
trust O
you O
, O
as O
you O
wish O
, O
alone O
. O
I O
will O
not O
even O
ask O
your O
intentions O
, O
for O
I O
am O
sure O
they O
will O
not O
lead O
you O
into O
wrong O
. O
" O
" O
Thank O
you O
, O
again O
and O
again O
, O
my O
own O
dear O
father O
. O
I O
hope O
I O
shall O
never O
do O
any O
thing O
to O
forfeit O
your O
confidence O
, O
" O
replied O
Herbert S-PERSON
, O
so O
eagerly O
that O
his O
cheeks O
flushed O
still O
deeper O
, O
and O
his O
eyes O
glistened O
| | O
then O
throwing O
himself O
on O
the O
stool O
at O
his O
mother's O
feet O
, O
he O
said O
, O
pleadingly O
, O
" O
Will O
you O
, O
too O
, O
trust O
me O
, O
dearest O
mother O
, O
and O
promise O
me O
not O
to O
be O
anxious O
, O
if O
I O
do O
not O
appear O
till O
after O
our O
dinner O
- O
hour O
? O
— O
promise O
me O
this O
, O
or O
I O
shall O
have O
no O
pleasure O
in O
my O
expedition O
. O
" O
" O
Most O
faithfully O
, O
" O
replied O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
fondly O
. O
" O
I O
trust O
my O
Herbert S-PERSON
almost O
as O
I O
would O
his O
father O
| | O
I O
do O
not O
say O
as O
much O
for O
this O
young O
man O
, O
nor O
for O
that O
, O
" O
she O
added O
, O
playfully O
laying O
her O
hand O
on O
Percy's S-PERSON
shoulder O
, O
and O
laughing O
at O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
so O
excessively O
amused O
at O
the O
sage O
Herbert's S-PERSON
turning O
truant O
, O
that O
he O
was O
giving O
vent O
to O
a O
variety O
of O
most O
grotesque O
antics O
of O
surprise O
. O
Percy S-PERSON
sighed O
so O
heavily O
that O
his O
mother O
was O
startled O
. O
" O
I O
did O
not O
intend O
to O
call O
such O
a O
very O
heavy O
sigh O
, O
my O
boy O
, O
" O
she O
said O
. O
" O
In O
an O
emergency O
I O
would O
trust O
you O
quite O
as O
implicitly O
as O
Herbert S-PERSON
| | O
but O
you O
have O
often O
yourself O
wished O
you O
had O
his O
steadiness O
. O
" O
" O
Indeed O
I O
do O
, O
mother O
| | O
I O
wish O
I O
were O
more O
like O
him O
in O
every O
thing O
, O
" O
exclaimed O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
far O
more O
despondingly O
than O
usual O
. O
" O
You O
will O
be O
steady O
all O
in O
time O
, O
my O
boy O
, O
I O
have O
not O
the O
very O
slightest O
fear O
| | O
and O
as O
I O
like O
variety O
, O
even O
in O
my O
sons O
, O
I O
would O
rather O
retain O
my O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
with O
all O
his O
boyish O
errors O
, O
than O
have O
even O
another O
Herbert S-PERSON
. O
So O
pray O
do O
not O
look O
so O
sad O
, O
or O
I O
shall O
fancy O
I O
have O
given O
you O
pain O
, O
when O
I O
only O
spoke O
in O
jest O
. O
" O
Percy S-PERSON
threw O
his O
arm O
round O
her O
waist O
, O
and O
kissed O
her O
two S-CARDINAL
or O
three S-CARDINAL
times O
, O
without O
saying O
a O
word O
, O
and O
when O
he O
started O
up O
and O
, O
said O
, O
in O
his O
usual O
gay O
tone O
, O
that O
as O
he O
was O
not O
going O
to O
turn O
truant O
the O
next O
day O
, O
he O
must O
go O
and O
finish O
some O
work O
, O
she O
saw O
tears O
in O
his O
eyes O
. O
That O
something O
was O
wrong O
, O
she O
felt O
certain O
, O
but O
still O
she O
trusted O
in O
his O
candor O
and O
integrity O
, O
and O
did O
not O
express O
her O
fears O
even O
to O
her O
husband O
. O
The O
morrow O
came O
. O
Percy S-PERSON
and O
Edward S-PERSON
went O
to O
Mr. O
Howard's S-PERSON
, O
and O
Herbert S-PERSON
at O
half B-DATE
- I-DATE
past I-DATE
nine E-DATE
mounted O
his O
quiet O
horse O
, O
and O
after O
affectionately O
embracing O
his O
mother O
, O
and O
again O
promising O
care O
and O
steadiness O
, O
departed O
. O
He O
had O
risen O
at O
five B-TIME
this I-TIME
morning E-TIME
, O
and O
studied O
till O
breakfast O
so O
earnestly O
that O
a O
double O
portion O
was O
prepared O
for O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
day E-DATE
. O
He O
had O
said O
, O
as O
he O
was O
starting O
, O
that O
, O
if O
he O
might O
remain O
out O
so O
long O
, O
he O
should O
like O
to O
call O
at O
Greville B-FAC
Manor E-FAC
on O
his O
way O
back O
, O
take O
tea O
there O
, O
and O
return O
home O
in O
the O
cool O
of O
the O
evening O
. O
" O
Your O
next O
request O
, O
my O
very O
modest O
son O
, O
will O
be O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
to O
stay O
out O
all O
night O
, O
" O
replied O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
| | O
" O
and O
that O
certainly O
will O
be O
refused O
. O
This O
is O
the O
last O
to O
which O
I O
shall O
consent O
— O
off O
with O
you O
, O
my O
boy O
, O
and O
enjoy O
yourself O
. O
" O
But O
Herbert S-PERSON
did O
not O
expect O
to O
enjoy O
himself O
half O
as O
much O
as O
if O
he O
had O
gone O
to O
Mr. O
Howard's S-PERSON
as O
usual O
. O
He O
did O
not O
like O
to O
mention O
his O
real O
object O
, O
for O
it O
appeared O
as O
if O
the O
chances O
were O
so O
much O
against O
its O
attainment O
, O
and O
if O
it O
were O
fulfilled O
, O
to O
speak O
about O
it O
would O
be O
equally O
painful O
, O
from O
its O
having O
been O
an O
act O
of O
kindness O
. O
The O
day O
passed O
quietly O
, O
and O
a B-TIME
full I-TIME
hour E-TIME
before O
prayers O
, O
Herbert S-PERSON
was O
seen O
riding O
through O
the O
grounds O
, O
and O
when O
he O
entered O
the O
usual O
sitting O
- O
room O
, O
he O
looked O
so O
happy O
, O
so O
animated O
that O
, O
if O
his O
parents O
had O
felt O
any O
anxiety O
— O
which O
they O
had O
not O
— O
it O
would O
have O
vanished O
at O
once O
. O
But O
though O
they O
were O
contented O
not O
to O
ask O
him O
any O
questions O
, O
the O
young O
party O

not O

by O
Percy S-PERSON
( O
who O
seemed O
intently O
engaged O
with O
a O
drawing O

, O
he O
was O
attacked O
on O
all O
sides O

, O
to O
add O
to O
their O
mirth O
, O
Mr. O

took O
the O
part O

" O

Herbert S-PERSON
had O
been O
very O
quietly O
at O
Mrs. O
Greville's S-PERSON
. O
That O
night O
, O
as O
Percy S-PERSON
sat O
in O
gloomy O
meditation O
in O
his O
own O
room O
, O
before O
he O
retired O
to O
bed O
, O
he O
felt O
a O
hand O
laid O
gently O
on O
his O
shoulder O
, O
and O
looking O
up O
, O
beheld O
his O
brother O
— O
" O
Have O
you O
lost O
all O
interest O
in O
me O
, O
Percy S-PERSON
? O
" O
asked O
Herbert S-PERSON
, O
with O
almost O
melancholy O
reproach O
. O
" O
If O
you O
had O
expressed O
one S-CARDINAL
word O
of O
inquiry O
as O
to O
my O
proceedings O
, O
I O
should O
have O
told O
you O
all O
without O
the O
slightest O
reserve O
. O
You O
have O
never O
before O
been O
so O
little O
concerned O
for O
me O
, O
and O
indeed O
I O
do O
not O
like O
it O
. O
" O
" O
I O
could O
not O
ask O
your O
confidence O
, O
my O
dear O
Herbert S-PERSON
, O
when O
for O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
three I-DATE
months E-DATE
I O
have O
been O
wanting O
in O
openness O
to O
you O
. O
Indeed O
, O
annoyed O
as O
I O
am O
with O
my O
own O
folly O
, O
I O
was O
as O
deeply O
interested O
as O
all O
the O
rest O
in O
your O
expedition O
, O
though O
I O
guessed O
its O
object O
could O
be O
nothing O
but O
kindness O
| | O
but O
how O
could O
I O
ask O
your O
secret O
when O
I O
was O
so O
reserved O
with O
you O
. O
" O
" O
Then O
do O
not O
let O
us O
have O
secrets O
from O
each O
other O
any O
longer O
, O
dearest O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
" O
pleaded O
Herbert S-PERSON
, O
twining O
his O
arm O
round O
his O
neck O
, O
and O
looking O
with O
affectionate O
confidence O
in O
his O
face O
. O
" O
I O
do O
not O
at O
all O
see O
why O
my O
secret O
must O
comprise O
more O
worth O
and O
kindness O
than O
yours O
. O
You O
talk O
of O
folly O
, O
and O
I O
have O
fancied O
for O
some O
days O
that O
you O
are O
not O
quite O
happy O
| | O
but O
you O
often O
blame O
yourself O
so O
much O
more O
than O
you O
deserve O
, O
that O
you O
do O
not O
frighten O
me O
in O
the O
least O
. O
You O
said O
, O
last O
night O
, O
you O
wished O
you O
were O
more O
like O
me O
| | O
but O
, O
indeed O
, O
if O
you O
were O
, O
I O
should O
be O
very O
sorry O
. O
What O
would O
become O
of O
me O
without O
your O
mirth O
and O
liveliness O
, O
and O
your O
strength O
and O
ever O
- O
working O
care O
to O
protect O
me O
from O
any O
thing O
like O
pain O
, O
either O
mentally O
or O
bodily O
? O
I O
should O
not O
like O
my O
own O
self O
for O
my O
brother O
at O
all O
. O
" O
" O
Nor O
I O
myself O
for O
mine O
, O
" O
replied O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
so O
strangely O
cheered O
, O
that O
he O
almost O
laughed O
at O
Herbert's S-PERSON
very O
novel O
idea O
, O
and O
after O
listening O
with O
earnest O
interest O
to O
his O
story O
, O
took O
courage O
and O
told O
his O
own O
. O
Herbert S-PERSON
in O
this O
instance O
, O
however O
, O
could O
not O
comfort O
him O
as O
successfully O
as O
usual O
. O
The O
satire O
was O
the O
terrible O
thing O
| | O
every O
thing O
else O
but O
that O
, O
even O
the O
disobedience O
of O
the O
debt O
, O
he O
thought O
might O
be O
easily O
remedied O
by O
an O
open O
confession O
to O
his O
father O
| | O
but O
that O
unfortunate O
oversight O
in O
not O
looking O
over O
his O
papers O
before O
he O
sent O
them O
to O
Mr. O
Harris S-PERSON
, O
the O
seeming O
utter O
impossibility O
to O
stop O
their O
circulation O
, O
was O
to O
both O
these O
single O
- O
hearted O
, O
high O
- O
principled O
lads O
something O
almost O
overwhelming O
. O
It O
did O
not O
in O
the O
least O
signify O
to O
either O
that O
Percy S-PERSON
might O
never O
be O
known O
as O
their O
author O
. O
Herbert S-PERSON
could O
not O
tell O
him O
what O
to O
do O
, O
except O
that O
, O
if O
he O
could O
but O
get O
sufficient O
courage O
to O
tell O
their O
father O
, O
even O
if O
he O
could O
not O
help O
them O
, O
he O
was O
sure O
it O
would O
be O
a O
great O
weight O
off O
his O
mind O
, O
and O
then O
he O
gently O
reproached O
him O
for O
not O
coming O
to O
him O
to O
help O
him O
discharge O
his O
debt O
| | O
it O
was O
surely O
much O
better O
to O
owe O
a O
trifle O
to O
his O
brother O
than O
to O
Mr. O
Harris S-PERSON
. O
" O
And O
, O
to O
gratify O
my O
extravagance O
, O
deprive O
you O
of O
some O
much O
purer O
and O
better O
pleasure O

replied O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
indignantly O
. O
" O
No O
, O
no O
, O
Bertie S-PERSON

never O
expect O
me O
to O
do O
any O
such O

rather O
suffer O
the O
penalty O

! O

wish O
to O

he O
added O
with O
almost O
comic O
ruefulness O
, O
" O
and O
had O
mamma O
to O
come O
to O

asked O
Mr. O

of O
his O
wife O
, O
on O
the O
Saturday S-DATE
morning O
after O
Herbert's S-PERSON
mysterious O
excursion O
. O
The O
family O
had O
not O
yet O
left O
the O
breakfast O
- O
table O
. O
" O
Perfectly O
well O

" O
was O
the O
reply O

" O
poor O
young O
man O
! O
his O
appearance O

painful O
weakness O
of O
voice O
called O
for O
commiseration O
too O
deeply O
not O

" O
" O
Is O

not O
deformed O
? O
" O
inquired O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON

" O
there O
was O
something O
particularly O
painful O
about O
his O
manner O

stood O
in O
the O
pulpit O

" O
" O
He O
is O
slightly O
deformed O
now O

but O
not O
five B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago E-DATE
he O
had O
a O
graceful O
, O
almost O
elegant O
figure O
, O
though O
always O
apparently O
too O
delicate O
for O
the O
fatiguing O
mental O
duties O
in O
which O
he O
indulged O
. O
He O
was O
of O
good O
family O
, O
but O
his O
parents O
were O
suddenly O
much O
reduced O
, O
and O
compelled O
to O
undergo O
many O
privations O
to O
enable O
him O
to O
go O
to O
Oxford S-GPE
. O
There O
he O
allowed O
himself O
neither O
relaxation O
nor O
pleasure O
of O
the O
most O
trifling O
and O
most O
harmless O
kind O

his O
only O
wish O
seemed O
to O
be O
to O
repay O
his O
parents O
in O
some O
degree O
the O
heavy O
debt O
of O
gratitude O
which O
he O
felt O
he O
owed O
them O
. O
His O
persevering O
study O
, O
great O
talent O
, O
and O
remarkable O
conduct O
, O
won O
him O
some O
valuable O
friends O
, O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
whom O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
was O
ordained O
, O
presented O
him O
with O
a O
rich O
living O
in O
the O
North S-LOC

For O
nine B-DATE
months E-DATE
he O
enjoyed O
the O
most O
unalloyed O
happiness O

His O
pretty O
vicarage O
presented O
a O
happy O

comfortable O
home O
for O
his O
parents O
, O
and O
the O
comforts O
they O
now O
enjoyed O
, O
earned O
by O
the O
worth O
of O
their O
son O

amply O
repaid O
them O
for O
former O
privations O

— O
One S-CARDINAL
cold O
snowy O
night O
he O
was O
summoned O
to O
a O
poor O
parishioner O
, O
living O
about B-QUANTITY
ten I-QUANTITY
miles E-QUANTITY
distant O

The O
road O
was O
rugged O

in O
some O
parts O
dangerous O

he O
was O
not O
a O
man O

shrink O
from O
his O
duty O

was O
detained O
eight B-TIME

the O
snow O

proceeded O

the O
next O

dead O
at O
the O
foot O

almost O
crushed O
under O

" O
An O
exclamation O

from O
all O

little O
group O

from O
Percy S-PERSON

face O
of O
the O
former O
was O
covered O
with O
his O
hands O

his O
brother O
seemed O
so O
watching O

feeling O
for O
him O

join O

so O
engrossed O
with O
Mr. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
tale O

that O
neither O

very O

ever O
again O

resign O
his O
rich O

beautiful O
living O
in O
Yorkshire S-GPE

he O
felt O
himself O
once O
more O
a O
burden O
on O
his O
parents O
, O
with O
scarcely O
any O
hope O
of O
supporting O
them O
again O

Nor O
was O
this O
all O

his O
figure O

once O
so O
slight O

supple O
, O
had O
become O
so O
shrunk O

maimed O

at O
first O

seemed O
actually O
to O
loathe O
the O
sight O
of O
his O
fellows O
. O
His O
voice O
, O
once O
so O
rich O
and O
almost O
thrilling O
, O
became O
wiry O
, O
and O
almost O
painfully O
monotonous O

and O
for O
some O
months O
the O
conflict O
for O
submission O
to O
this O
inscrutable O
and O
most O
awful O
trial O
was O
so O
terrible O
that O
he O
nearly O
sunk O
beneath O
it O

This O
was O
, O
of O
course O

still O
more O
physical O

mental O

gradually O
subsided O

after O
eighteen B-DATE

residence O
in O
Madeira S-GPE

sent O
by O

benevolent O

health O
returned O

earnestly O

" O
" O
But O
when O
did O
you O
become O
acquainted O
with O
him O
, O
papa O
? O
" O
asked O
Caroline S-PERSON

" O
you O
have O
never O
mentioned O
him O
before O
. O
" O
" O
No O
, O
my O
dear O

I O
never O
saw O
him O
till O
the O
Sunday S-DATE
he O
officiated O
for O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
| | O
but O
his O
appearance O
so O
deeply O
interested O
me O
, O
I O
did O
not O
rest O
till O
I O
had O
learned O
his O
whole O
history O
, O
which O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
had O
already O
discovered O
. O
He O
has O
been O
nearly B-DATE
a I-DATE
year E-DATE
in O
Devonshire S-GPE
, O
but O
so O
kept O
aloof O
from O
all O
but O
his O
own O
poor O
parishioners O
, O
dreading O
the O
ridicule O
and O
sneers O
of O
the O
more O
worldly O
and O
wealthy O
, O
that O
it O
was O
mere O
accident O
which O
made O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
acquainted O
with O
him O
. O
Our O
good O
minister's O
friendship O
and O
earnest O
exhortations O
have O
so O
far O
overcome O
his O
too O
great O
sensitiveness O
, O
as O
sometimes O
to O
prevail O
on O
him O
to O
visit O
the O
Vicarage S-FAC
, O
and O
I O
trust O
in O
time O
equally O
to O
succeed O
in O
bringing O
him O
here O
. O
" O
" O
But O
what O
is O
he O
so O
afraid O
of O
, O
dear O
papa O
? O
" O
innocently O
asked O
Emmeline S-PERSON
. O
" O
Surely O
nobody O
could O
be O
so O
cruel O
as O
to O
ridicule O
him O
because O
he O
is O
deformed O
? O
" O
" O
Unfortunately O
, O
my O
dear O
child O
, O
there O
are O
too O
many O
who O
only O
enter O
church O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
the O
sermon O
and O
the O
preacher O
, O
and O
to O
criticise O
severely O
and O
uncharitably O
all O
that O
differs O
from O
their O
preconceived O
ideas O
| | O
to O
such O
persons O
Mr. O
Morton S-PERSON
must O
be O
an O
object O
of O
derision O
. O
And O
now O
I O
come O
to O
the O
real O
reason O
of O
my O
asking O
your O
mother O
if O
she O
remembered O
him O
. O
" O
" O
Then O
you O
had O
a O
reason O
, O
" O
answered O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
smiling O

" O
your O
story O
has O
made O
me O
wonder O

you O

you O
recollect O
, O
for O
a O
fortnight O
after O
the O
Sunday S-DATE

heard O
him O

preached O
twice O

week O
at O
Torrington S-GPE

to O
oblige O
a O
very O
particular O
friend O

" O
" O
Yes O
, O
and O
that O
you O
feared O
the O
increased O
number O
of O
the O
congregation O

yesterday S-DATE
I O
called O
on O
him O
, O

had O
some O
hours' O
interesting O
conversation O

He O
was O
evidently O
even O
more O
than O
usually O
depressed O

self O

shrinking O

if O
I O

use O
the O

at O
length O
touched O
, O
it O
seemed O
, O
by O
my O
sympathy O
, O
he O
drew O
my O
attention O
to O
a O
poem O

" O

" O
" O
It O
is O
never O
sufficiently O

it O
would O
require O
a O
person O

Harris S-PERSON
has O
, O
to O
resist O

temptation O

inserting O

a O
double O

treble O
number O

I O
spoke O
to O
him O
at O
once O

bought O
up O
every O

at O

only O
confirms O
the O
lesson O
I O
have O
so O
often O
tried O

teach O
you O
all O

that O
any O

my O

not O
have O
been O
so O
taught O

Satire O
and O
ridicule O
are O
unhappily O
so O
popular O
, O
that O
these O
verses O
may O
have O
been O
penned O
without O
any O
thought O
of O
their O
evil O
tendency O
, O
merely O
as O
to O
the O
éclat O
they O
would O
bring O
their O
author O

must O
not O
be O
too O
severe O

ever O
loved O
me O

" O
at O
length O
exclaimed O
poor O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
so O
choked O
with O
his O
emotion O
, O
that O
he O
could O
only O
throw O
himself O
by O
her O
side O
, O
bury O
his O
face O
in O
her O
lap O
, O
and O
sob O
for O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes E-TIME
like O
a O
child O
. O
But O
he O
recovered O
himself O
with O
a O
strong O
effort O
, O
before O
either O
of O
his O
family O
could O
conquer O
their O
anxiety O
and O
alarm O
, O
and O
, O
standing O
erect O
, O
though O
pale O
as O
marble O
, O
without O
in O
the O
least O
degree O
attempting O
excuse O
or O
extenuation O
, O
acknowledged O
the O
poem O
as O
his O
, O
and O
poured O
out O
his O
whole O
story O
, O
with O
the O
sole O
exception O
of O
how O
he O
had O
disposed O
of O
the O
money O
, O
with O
which O
the O
second S-ORDINAL
time O
of O
receiving O
his O
allowance O
he O
had O
intended O
to O
discharge O
his O
debt O

the O
manner O
in O
which O
he O
told O
that O
part O
of O
his O
tale O

from O
the O
fear O
that O
it O
would O
seem O
like O
an O
excuse O

a O
boast O

certainly O
more O
calculated O

call O

Herbert S-PERSON
was O
about O
to O
speak O

an O
imploring O
glance O
from O
Percy S-PERSON

him O

Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON

silent O
several B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
after O
his O
son O

concluded O

Percy S-PERSON

so O
evidently O
distressed O

suffered O
so O
much O
from O
the O
consequence O

his O
own O
errors O

so O
intensely O
the O
unintentional O
publication O

father O

his O
truth O
far O
too O
well O
to O
doubt O
his O
tale O

there O
was O
something O
so O
intrinsically O
noble O
in O
his O
brave O
confession O
, O
that O
to O
condemn O
him O
severely O

felt O
as O

" O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
looked O
very O
thoughtful O

did O
not O

In O
the B-TIME
hour E-TIME
of O
recreation O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
declaring O
it O
was O
much O
too O
hot O
for O
the O
garden O
, O
sought O
her O
mother's O
private O
sitting O
- O
room O
, O
with O
the O
intention O
of O
asking O

she O
could O
find O
her O
father O

To O
her O
great O
delight O
, O
the O
question O
was O
arrested O
on O
her O
lips O

for O
he O
was O
there O
. O
She O
seated O
herself O
on O
his O
knee O
, O
and O
remained O
there O
for O
some B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
without O
speaking O
— O
only O
looking O
up O
in O
his O
face O
with O
the O
most O
coaxing O
expression O
imaginable O

" O
Well O
, O
Emmeline S-PERSON

what O
great O
favor O
are O
you O
going O

said O
Mr. O

smiling O

shaking O
her O
head O

her O
long O
bright O
ringlets O

hid O
her O
eyes O

Mrs. O

" O
I O
am O
very O

her O

added O

not O

angry O

not O
that O
the O
boon O

no O
courage O
to O
ask O

" O
A O
still O
deeper O
glow O
mounted O
to O
the O
child's O
fair O
cheek O
, O
and O
throwing O
her O
arms O
round O
her O
father's O
neck O

she O
said O
, O
coaxingly O

fondly O
— O

Mamma O
has O
guessed O
it O

dear O
papa O

you O
must O
, O
indeed O

you O
must O
forgive O
him O

poor O
fellow O

he O
is O
so O
very O
sorry O

has O
suffered O
so O
much O
already O

away O

you O
not O

I O
wonder O

is O
most O
certain O

that O
mamma O

be O
a O
witch O

caressingly O
stroking O
the O
ringlets O

after O
to O

day O

do O
grant O

exclaimed O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
almost O
suffocating O
him O
with O
kisses O
, O

then O
starting O
from O
his O
knee O

she O
danced O
about O
the O
room O

a O
perfect O
ecstasy O

delight O

" O
and O

be O
happy O
again O

all O

now O

yourself O
sober O
again O

In O
an O
instant O
she O
was O
on O
his O
knee O
again O

quite O
quiet O

attentive O

" O
In O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
place O

do O
you O
think O
Percy S-PERSON
was O
justified O

Mr. O

an O
object O
of O
satire O

all O

prove O

" O

well O
explained O

my O
little O

you O

just O
before O

then O
to O
be O
generous O
, O
had O
denied O
himself O
some O
pleasure O
, O
his O
conduct O
would O
not O
have O
given O
us O

himself O
any O
pain O

have O
been O
quite O

worthy O

all O
the O
praise O
you O
could O
bestow O

now O
I O
wonder O
how O

have O
discovered O

no O

slipped O
from O

from O

felt O

FATHER'S O

INFLUENCE O

Meanwhile O
the O
young O
heir O
of O
Oakwood S-GPE
had O
passed O
no O
very O
pleasant O
day O
. O
His O
thoughts O
since O
Mr. O
Howard's S-PERSON
return O
had O
been O
so O
pre-occupied O
, O
that O
his O
studies O
had O
been O
unusually O
neglected O
| | O
so O
much O
so O
, O
as O
rather O
to O
excite O
the O
displeasure O
of O
his O
gentle O
and O
forbearing O
preceptor O
. O
The O
emotion O
of O
the O
morning O
had O
not O
tended O
to O
steady O
his O
ideas O
, O
and O
a O
severe O
reproof O
and O
long O
imposition O
was O
the O
consequence O
. O
Not O
one S-CARDINAL
word O
did O
he O
deign O
to O
address O
Herbert S-PERSON
and O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
who O
, O
perceiving O
him O
leave O
the O
Vicarage S-FAC
with O
every O
mark O
of O
irritation O
, O
endeavored O
, O
during O
their O
walk O
home O
, O
to O
soothe O
him O
. O
His O
step O
was O
even O
more O
rapid O
than O
that O
in O
which O
he O
had O
left O
home O
, O
and O
he O
neither O
stopped O
nor O
spoke O
till O
he O
had O
reached O
his O
father's O
library O
, O
which O
, O
fortunately O
for O
the O
indulgence O
of O
his O
ire O
in O
words O
, O
was O
untenanted O
. O
He O
dashed O
his O
cap O
from O
his O
brow O
, O
flung O
his O
books O
with O
violence O
on O
the O
ground O
, O
and O
burst O
forth O
— O
" O
Am O
I O
not O
a O
fool O
— O
an O
idiot O
, O
thus O
to O
torment O
myself O
, O
and O
for O
one S-CARDINAL
act O
of O
folly O
, O
when O
hundreds S-CARDINAL
of O
boys O
, O
at O
my O
age O
, O
are O
entirely O
their O
own O
masters O
? O
do O
what O
they O
please O
— O
spend O
what O
they O
please O
— O
neither O
questioned O
nor O
reproved O
— O
and O
that O
poem O
— O
how O
many O
would O
glory O
in O
its O
authorship O
, O
and O
not O
care O
a O
whit O
whom O
it O
might O
wound O
. O
Why O
am O
I O
such O
a O
fool O
, O
as O
to O
reproach O
myself O
about O
it O
, O
and O
then O
be O
punished O
, O
like O
a O
school O
- O
boy O
, O
with O
an O
imposition O
to O
occupy O
me O
at O
home O
, O
because O
I O
did O
not O
choose O
to O
learn O
in O
the O
hours O
of O
study O
? O
— O
Not O
choose O
! O
I O
wish O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
could O
feel O
as O
I O
have O
done O
to O
- O
day O
, O
nay O
, O
all O
this O
week O

and O
I O
challenge O
him O
to O
bore O
his O
head O
with O
Greek S-NORP
and O
Latin S-LANGUAGE
! O
But O
why O
am O
I O
so O
cowed O
as O
to O
feel O
so O
? O
Why O
can O
not O
I O
have O
the O
same O
spirit O
as O
others O
— O
instead O
of O
being O
such O
a O
slave O

" O
exclaimed O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
who O
, O
having O
sought O
him O
the O
moment O
she O
heard O
the O
hall O
- O
door O
close O
, O
had O
heard O
nearly O
the O
whole O
of O
his O
violent O
speech O
, O
and O
was O
almost O
alarmed O
at O
the O
unusual O
passion O
it O
evinced O
. O
Her O
voice O
of O
astonished O
expostulation O
checked O
his O
words O
, O
but O
not O
his O
agitation O

he O
threw O
himself O
on O
a O
chair O
, O
leaning O
his O
arms O
upon O
the O
table O
, O
buried O
his O
face O
upon O
them O
, O
while O
his O
whole O
frame O
shook O
. O
His O
mother O
sat O
down O
by O
him O
, O
and O
laying O
her O
hand O
on O
his O
arm O
, O
said O
gently O
— O
" O
What O
is O
it O
that O
has O
so O
irritated O
you O

my O
dear O
Percy S-PERSON

What O
has O
made O
you O
return O
home O
in O
such O
a O
very O
different O
mood O
to O
that O
in O
which O
you O
left O
it O
? O
Tell O
me O
, O
my O
boy O
. O
" O
Percy S-PERSON
tried O
to O
keep O
silence O
, O
for O
he O
knew O
if O
he O
spoke O
he O
should O
, O
as O
he O
expressed O
it O
, O
be O
a O
child O
again O
, O
and O
his O
pride O
tried O
hard O
for O
victory O
. O
Even O
his O
father O
or O
Herbert S-PERSON
at O
that O
moment O
would O
have O
chafed O
him O
into O
increased O
anger O
, O
but O
the O
almost O
passionate O
love O
and O
reverence O
which O
he O
felt O
for O
his O
mother O
triumphed O
over O
his O
wrath O
, O
and O
told O
him O
he O
was O
much O
more O
unhappy O
than O
angry O
| | O
and O
that O
he O
longed O
for O
her O
to O
comfort O
him O
, O
as O
she O
always O
had O
done O
in O
his O
childish O
griefs O

and O
so O
he O
put O
his O
arms O
round O
her O
, O
and O
laid O
his O
head O
on O
her O
shoulder O
and O
said O
, O
in O
a O
half O
- O
choked O
voice O
: O
— O
" O
I O
am O
very O
unhappy O
, O
mother O

I O
feel O
as O
if O
I O
had O
been O
every O
thing O

was O
bad O

cruel O

foolish O

so O
it O
was O
a O
relief O
to O
be O
in O
a O
passion O

but O
I O
did O
not O
mean O
you O
to O
hear O
it O
, O
and O
cause O
you O
more O
grief O
than O
I O
have O
done O
already O
. O
" O
" O
You O
have O
been O
very O
thoughtless O
, O
very O
foolish O
, O
and O
not O
quite O
so O
firm O
as O
we O
could O
have O
wished O
, O
my O
own O
dear O
boy O

I O
will O
not O
have O
you O
accuse O
yourself O
of O
any O
graver O
faults O

replied O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
as O
she O
lightly O
pushed O
back O
the O
clustering O
hair O
from O
his O
heated O
forehead O
, O
and O
the O
gentle O
touch O
of O
her O
cool O
hand O
seemed O
as O
restorative O
as O
her O
soothing O
words O

Percy S-PERSON

as O
he O
listened O
to O
her O
, O
as O
she O
continued O
speaking O
to O
him O
in O
the O
same O
strain O
for O
some O
little O
time O
, O
felt O
more O
relieved O
than O
five B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
before O
he O
thought O
possible O
, O
and O
more O
than O
ever O
determined O
that O
he O
would O
never O
act O
so O
thoughtlessly O

or O
, O
if O
he O
were O
tempted O
to O
do O
so O
, O
never O
keep O
it O
concealed O
so O
long O
again O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
anxious O
desire O
with O
him O
was O
, O
always O
to O
do O
justice O
to O
his O
better O
qualities O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
that O
she O
blamed O
and O
convinced O
him O
of O
his O
faults O

It O
was O
a O
very O
delicate O
thing O
, O

very O
difficult O
to O
succeed O
in O
, O
perhaps O
impossible O
to O
minds O
less O
peculiarly O
refined O
, O

hearts O
less O
intensely O
anxious O
than O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON

but O
no O
difficulty O
, O
no O
failure O

had O
ever O
deterred O
her O
— O
and O
in O
Percy S-PERSON
she O
was O
already O
rewarded O
. O
He O
was O
of O
that O
high O
, O
fine O
spirit O
, O
that O
any O
unjust O
harshness O
would O
have O
actually O
confirmed O
in O
error O
— O
any O
unguarded O
word O
bring O
argument O
on O
argument O

so O

for O
the O
mere O
sake O
of O
opposition O

cause O
him O
to O
abide O
in O
his O
opinions O
, O
when O
the O
acknowledgment O
of O
his O
being O
right O
in O
some O
things O
, O
produced O
the O
voluntary O
confession O
of O
his O
error O
in O
others O

" O
And O
now O
about O
these O
unfortunate O
verses O

my O
dear O
boy O

am O
not O
quite O
clear O
as O

their O
fate O

it O

I O
fully O
intended O

believed O

done O
so O

the O
whirl O
of O
that O
night O

to O
extend O

morning O

I O
dressed O

prepared O
for O

such O
a O

outside O

burnt O
those O

really O
wished O

threw O
those O

me O
all O

pain O
into O
my O

utter O
bewilderment O

Do O
both O

repeated O

" O
Yes O

my O
boy O

it O

a O
painful O
remedy O

would O
be O
an O
effectual O

Mr. O

tell O
him O
yourself O
your O
whole O
story O

Percy S-PERSON
crimsoned O
to O
the O
very O
temples O
. O
" O
Do O
not O
ask O
me O
such O
a O
thing O
, O
mother O

he O
answered O
very O
hurriedly O

" O
I O
can O
not O
do O
it O
. O
" O
" O
You O
think O
so O
at O
this O
moment O
, O
my O
dear O
boy O
| | O
I O
am O
not O
at O
all O
astonished O
that O
you O
should O
, O
for O
it O
will O
be O
very O
humiliating O
, O
and O
very O
painful O
| | O
and O
if O
I O
could O
spare O
you O
either O
the O
humiliation O
or O
the O
pain O
, O
yet O
produce O
the O
same O
good O
effects O
, O
I O
need O
not O
tell O
you O
how O
gladly O
I O
would O
| | O
but O
no O
one O
can O
remove O
the O
sting O
of O
that O
poem O
from O
Mr. O
Morton's S-PERSON
sensitive O
feelings O
but O
yourself O

and O
I O
am O
quite O
sure O
if O
you O
will O
allow O
yourself O
a O
little O
time O
for O
quiet O
thought O
, O
you O
will O
agree O
with O
me O
. O
" O
" O
But O
why O
should O
I O
inflict O
such O
pain O
upon O
myself O
, O
granting O
I O
deserve O
it O
? O
" O
answered O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
still O
much O
heated O
| | O
" O
when O
, O
though O
my O
poem O
is O
the O
only O
one O
that O
has O
unfortunately O
met O
his O
eye O
, O
the O
others O
were O
quite O
as O
galling O
, O
and O
my O
companions O
quite O
as O
much O
to O
blame O
— O
why O
should O
I O
be O
the O
sufferer O
? O
" O
" O
Because O
, O
by O
many O
errors O
, O
you O
have O
brought O
it O
on O
yourself O
. O
Your O
companions O
did O
indeed O
act O
very O
wrongly O
, O
but O
are O
we O
quite O
sure O
that O
the O
principles O
which O
your O
father O
and O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
have O
so O
carefully O
impressed O
upon O
you O

been O

carefully O
impressed O
upon O

in O
such O
a O
case O
are O
not O
you O
the O
more O
responsible O

They O
had O
evidently O
no O
inward O
check O
to O
keep O
them O
from O
such O
an O
amusement O

you O
had O
, O
for O
you O
have O
acknowledged O
that O
you O
kept O
aloof O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
, O
knowing O
it O
was O
wrong O
, O
and O
only O
yielded O
from O
want O
of O
sufficient O
firmness O
. O
Inflict O
the O
pain O
of O
an O
avowal O
upon O
yourself O
, O
my O
boy O
, O
and O
its O
memory O
will O
help O
you O
in O
future O
from O
yielding O
to O
too O
great O
weakness O
— O
and O
the O
act O
prove O
to O
us O
that O
, O
though O
for O
a O
moment O
led O
into O
great O
error O
, O
you O
are O
still O
as O
brave O
and O
honest O
as O
we O
believe O
you O
. O
" O
Percy S-PERSON
did O
not O
reply O
, O
but O
his O
countenance O
denoted O
an O
inward O
struggle O
, O
and O
his O
mother O
added O
— O
" O
Suppose O
, O
as O
is O
very O
likely O
, O
Mr. O

becomes O
intimate O

him O

perfectly O

that O

You O
may O
fancy O
now O
that O

I O
lay O
no O

you O
to O
seek O

Morton S-PERSON

I O
have O
only O
told O
you O
that O
which O
I O
believe O
would O
restore O
you O
to O
happiness O

atone O

more O

She O
left O

Percy S-PERSON
remained O
for O
some B-TIME

in O
deep O

when O

joined O
his O

it O
was O
still O
in O

unbroken O
silence O

Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
took O
no O

him O
, O

two S-CARDINAL

three S-CARDINAL

the O
little O
affectionate O
Emmeline S-PERSON
felt O
the O
tears O

to O

in O
general O
the O

so O
silent O

Sliding O
after O
him O

he O
quitted O
the O
room O
after O
dinner O

she O
took O
his O

longing O

not O
daring O

tell O
him O

hour E-TIME
after O

were O
overtaken O
by O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
riding O
at O
what O
seemed O
almost O
a O
hand O
gallop O
, O

he O
had O
time O
as O
he O
passed O
his O
mother O
to O
gracefully O
doff O
his O
cap O

her O
fond O
heart O
throbbed O

earnest O
face O

out O

met O

who O
had O
not O
seen O
Mary S-PERSON

nearly B-DATE
a I-DATE
fortnight E-DATE

was O
in O
an O
ecstasy O
of O
enjoyment O

Ellen S-PERSON
always O
felt O
it O
a O
real O
pleasure O
quietly O
to O
walk O
by O
Mary's S-PERSON
side O

answer O
the O
many O
questions O

Mr. O

Herbert S-PERSON

Edward S-PERSON

somewhat O
surprised O

even O
more O

ordinary O
warmth O

the O
flush O

she O
inquired O

looked O
at O
him O

her O
eyes O
glistened O
in O
tears O

" O
Oh O
, O
not O
in O
the O
least O
, O

he O
replied O
instantly O

as O
if O
he O
would O
exceedingly O
like O
to O
change O
the O
subject O

Mrs. O
Greville S-PERSON

turning O
to O

you O
forgive O
me O

confess O

my O
visit O
this O
evening O
was O
more O
to O
inquire O
after O
your O
son O

than O
even O
to O
see O
you O

was O
so O
anxious O
to O
know O
that O
he O
had O
suffered O
no O
inconvenience O

his O
unusual O
, O

sure O
fatiguing O

candid O

replied O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
smiling O

" O
but O
I O
feel O
very O
much O
inclined O
to O
be O
so O

finding O
that O
you O
are O
more O
in O
my O
son's O
confidence O

am O
myself O

from O
home O

Thursday S-DATE

you O
not O

Mary S-PERSON

her O
mother O
at O
the O
same O
moment O

hear O
something O

kept O
him O
with O
him O

engaged O

from O
being O
left O
entirely O

himself O

sought O
the O
worst O
companions O

can O
not O
think O
what O
charm O

used O

quite O
contented O

dined O
together O

me O

a O

assures O
me O

Mary S-PERSON
had O
first S-ORDINAL
begun O
to O
speak O
, O
Herbert S-PERSON
tried O
to O
retreat O
| | O
but O
Edward S-PERSON
placing O
himself O
against O
the O
door O
, O
so O
that O
to O
open O
it O
was O
impossible O
, O
and O
Caroline S-PERSON
and O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
both O
at O
once O
catching O
hold O
of O
him O
, O
to O
keep O
him O
prisoner O
, O
egress O
was O
not O
to O
be O
thought O
of O
| | O
so O
, O
in O
laughing O
despair O
, O
he O
broke O
from O
his O
sisters O
, O
flung O
himself O
on O
his O
usual O
seat O
, O
his O
mother's O
stool O
, O
and O
almost O
hid O
himself O
in O
her O
dress O
. O
" O
It O
must O
have O
been O
a O
relief O
, O
indeed O
, O
" O
answered O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
| | O
" O
and O
rejoiced O
am O
I O
that O
my O
quiet O
Herbert S-PERSON
thought O
of O
such O
a O
plan O
. O
Look O
up O
, O
Master O
Shamefaced O
, O
and O
tell O
us O
the O
reason O
of O
your O
most O
extraordinary O
mystery O
on O
this O
occasion O
. O
Why O
did O
you O
so O
carefully O
conceal O
your O
intentions O
from O
your O
mother O
and O
myself O
? O
" O
" O
Because O
, O
papa O
, O
I O
feared O
you O
might O
not O
approve O
of O
them O
| | O
I O
hardly O
dared O
think O
about O
it O
myself O
, O
for O
it O
seemed O
as O
if O
I O
were O
doing O
actually O
wrong O
in O
disregarding O
your O
principles O
, O
for O
only O
the O
chance O
of O
effecting O
good O
. O
I O
know O
, O
if O
I O
had O
mentioned O
my O
wish O
to O
find O
Alfred S-PERSON
, O
or O
hear O
something O
about O
him O
, O
you O
would O
not O
have O
refused O
my O
going O
| | O
but O
then O
mamma O
must O
have O
known O
it O
, O
and O
she O
would O
have O
been O
anxious O
and O
uncomfortable O
, O
if O
I O
had O
not O
appeared O
the O
very O
moment O
I O
had O
named O
| | O
would O
you O
not O
? O
" O
he O
continued O
, O
looking O
up O
in O
her O
face O
with O
that O
expression O
of O
affection O
, O
which O
very O
few O
, O
even O
comparative O
strangers O
, O
had O
power O
to O
remit O
. O
" O
I O
should O
indeed O
, O
my O
dear O
boy O
| | O
I O
fear O
I O
should O
have O
condemned O
your O
scheme O
as O
a O
very O
wild O
one O
, O
and O
really O
am O
glad O
you O
thought O
so O
much O
of O
my O
comfort O
, O
as O
not O
to O
tell O
me O
more O
than O
you O
did O
. O
So O
I O
must O
not O
even O
be O
jealous O
, O
Jessie S-PERSON
, O
but O
rather O
propose O
a O
vote O
of O
thanks O
to O
you O
and O
Mary S-PERSON
for O
solving O
the O
mystery O
. O
I O
do O
not O
think O
Herbert S-PERSON
ever O
excited O
so O
much O
curiosity O
and O
speculation O
, O
in O
his O
life O
, O
before O
. O
" O
The O
entrance O
of O
Mr. O
Grahame S-PERSON
changed O
the O
current O
of O
the O
conversation O
, O
greatly O
to O
Herbert's S-PERSON
relief O
, O
for O
he O
did O
not O
at O
all O
like O
being O
thus O
brought O
forward O
. O
Austere O
as O
Grahame S-PERSON
was O
at O
home O
, O
he O
was O
always O
welcomed O
with O
pleasure O
by O
the O
young O
Hamiltons S-PERSON
, O
who O
never O
could O
understand O
why O
Annie S-PERSON
and O
Cecil S-PERSON
should O
so O
fear O
him O
. O
That O
something O
unusual O
had O
annoyed O
him O
, O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
perceived O
at O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
glance O
| | O
but O
he O
took O
no O
notice O
, O
for O
Grahame S-PERSON
seemed O
to O
find O
relief O
in O
talking O
gayly O
to O
the O
young O
people O
. O
" O
And O
where O
is O
my O
friend O
Percy S-PERSON
? O
" O
he O
inquired O
, O
as O
he O
joined O
the O
happy O
group O
at O
tea O
, O
and O
Percy S-PERSON
was O
still O
absent O
. O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
repeated O
the O
question O
in O
some O
surprise O
| | O
but O
his O
wife O
replying O
that O
he O
had O
gone O
to O
ride O
, O
and O
might O
not O
be O
back O
yet O
, O
the O
subject O
dropped O
. O
After O
tea O
, O
Mrs. O
Greville S-PERSON
and O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
attended O
by O
Herbert S-PERSON
and O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
returned O
to O
the O
Manor S-FAC
| | O
and O
the O
little O
girls O
went O
to O
finish O
some O
business O
for O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
day E-DATE
, O
and O
amuse O
themselves O
as O
they O
liked O
. O
Grahame S-PERSON
remained O
alone O
with O
his O
friends O
, O
who O
at O
length O
drew O
from O
him O
the O
cause O
of O
his O
solicitude O
. O
He O
had O
that O
morning O
discovered O
, O
that O
, O
notwithstanding O
his O
positive O
commands O
, O
Cecil S-PERSON
had O
gone O
to O
the O
prohibited O
places O
of O
amusement O
. O
His O
wife O
had O
prevaricated O
when O
he O
questioned O
her O
| | O
at O
one O
moment O
almost O
denying O
her O
connivance O
at O
the O
boy's O
disobedience O
, O
at O
another O
unconsciously O
acknowledging O
it O
, O
by O
insisting O
that O
there O
was O
no O
harm O
in O
it O
| | O
and O
if O
Grahame S-PERSON
would O
persist O
in O
so O
interfering O
with O
his O
children's O
amusements O
, O
he O
must O
expect O
to O
be O
disobeyed O
. O
If O
such O
were O
his O
home O
, O
where O
was O
he O
to O
look O
for O
truth O
, O
honor O
, O
and O
affection O
? O
What O
would O
be O
his O
son's O
after O
career O
, O
if O
such O
were O
the O
lessons O
of O
his O
childhood O
? O
He O
had O
punished O
him O
severely O
, O
but O
there O
was O
little O
hope O
of O
its O
producing O
any O
good O
effect O
, O
when O
his O
wife O
was O
yet O
more O
to O
blame O
than O
his O
child O
. O
It O
would O
only O
alienate O
the O
boy's O
affections O
still O
more O
from O
him O
. O
Yet O
what O
could O
he O
do O
? O
Could O
he O
let O
such O
disobedience O
and O
untruthfulness O
— O
for O
Cecil S-PERSON
had O
denied O
his O
having O
been O
at O
the O
races O
— O
pass O
unnoticed O
? O
He O
had O
shut O
himself O
up O
in O
his O
library O
the O
remainder O
of O
the O
day O
| | O
but O
at O
length O
, O
unable O
to O
bear O
his O
own O
thoughts O
, O
had O
walked O
over O
to O
Oakwood S-GPE
, O
feeling O
sure O
, O
if O
peace O
were O
to O
be O
found O
, O
he O
should O
find O
it O
there O
. O
Their O
sympathy O
it O
was O
easy O
for O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
to O
give O
— O
for O
they O
felt O
it O
sincerely O
— O
but O
to O
advise O
was O
both O
delicate O
and O
difficult O
. O
To O
interfere O
in O
a O
household O
is O
not O
the O
part O
even O
of O
the O
most O
intimate O
friends O
. O
And O
when O
Lady O
Helen S-PERSON
herself O
encouraged O
the O
boy O
in O
his O
disobedience O
, O
and O
showed O
him O
an O
example O
of O
equivocation O
, O
what O
could O
be O
said O
? O
Grahame S-PERSON
could O
not O
bear O
the O
idea O
of O
a O
public O
school O
for O
a O
boy O
scarcely O
eleven O
, O
and O
whose O
home O
- O
influence O
was O
so O
injurious O
, O
and O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
could O
not O
advise O
it O
. O
He O
tried O
, O
therefore O
, O
merely O
to O
raise O
the O
depressed O
spirits O
of O
his O
friend O
, O
bringing O
forward O
many O
instances O
, O
when O
even O
the O
best O
training O
failed O
| | O
and O
others O
where O
the O
faults O
of O
childhood O
were O
subdued O
by O
circumstances O
, O
and O
became O
fair O
promising O
youth O
. O
Grahame S-PERSON
shook O
his O
head O
despondingly O
. O
" O
You O
can O
scarcely O
be O
a O
fit O
judge O
of O
my O
trial O
, O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
" O
he O
said O
| | O
" O
you O
have O
known O
nothing O
but O
the O
blessing O
of O
hand O
- O
in O
- O
hand O
companionship O
, O
in O
the O
training O
of O
your O
children O
, O
as O
in O
every O
thing O
else O
. O
There O
must O
be O
unity O
between O
father O
and O
mother O
, O
or O
there O
is O
little O
hope O
of O
joy O
in O
their O
offspring O
for O
either O
| | O
were O
my O
wife O
only O
in O
some O
things O
like O
yours O
— O
but O
I O
see O
I O
must O
not O
speak O
so O
, O
" O
he O
added O
hurriedly O
, O
as O
he O
met O
a O
glance O
of O
reproach O
from O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
and O
he O
turned O
to O
address O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
lads O
, O
who O
at O
that O
instant O
entered O
from O
their O
walk O
. O
The O
bell O
for O
prayers O
rung O
soon O
afterward O
, O
and O
Grahame S-PERSON
rose O
to O
say O
good O
night O
. O
" O
Nay O
, O
stay O
with O
us O
, O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
earnestly O
. O
" O
Why O
should O
the O
call O
for O
devotion O
be O
the O
signal O
for O
separation O
? O
join O
us O
, O
Grahame S-PERSON
. O
It O
is O
not O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
by O
very O
many O
that O
we O
have O
prayed O
together O
. O
" O
Grahame S-PERSON
yielded O
without O
an O
instant's O
hesitation O
. O
Still O
Percy S-PERSON
had O
not O
returned O
, O
and O
his O
mother O
became O
dreadfully O
anxious O
. O
Her O
husband O
, O
at O
her O
request O
, O
waited O
a B-TIME
quarter I-TIME
of I-TIME
an I-TIME
hour E-TIME
, O
but O
reluctantly O
| | O
for O
he O
was O
more O
particular O
that O
every O
member O
of O
his O
household O
should O
assemble O
at O
the O
stated O
hour O
of O
prayer O
, O
than O
in O
any O
other O
point O
relating O
to O
his O
establishment O
. O
Scarcely O
, O
however O
, O
had O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
word O
been O
said O
, O
when O
Percy S-PERSON
and O
Robert S-PERSON
entered O
, O
and O
the O
former O
, O
with O
a O
very O
rapid O
, O
but O
noiseless O
step O
, O
traversed O
the O
large O
room O
, O
and O
kneeled O
in O
his O
accustomed O
place O
. O
In O
vain O
did O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
try O
to O
keep O
her O
thoughts O
fixed O
on O
the O
service O
. O
Had O
he O
really O
been O
to O
Mr. O
Morton S-PERSON
, O
and O
if O
he O
had O
, O
how O
had O
he O
been O
received O
? O
had O
his O
fine O
spirit O
been O
soothed O
or O
irritated O
? O
and O
a B-CARDINAL
thousand E-CARDINAL
other O
nameless O
but O
natural O
fears O
thronged O
her O
heart O
. O
But O
one S-CARDINAL
look O
on O
her O
son O
as O
he O
rose O
reassured O
her O
| | O
his O
cheek O
was O
flushed O
with O
rapid O
riding O
, O
but O
his O
dark O
eye O
sparkled O
, O
and O
he O
looked O
more O
bright O
and O
joyous O
than O
he O
had O
done O
for O
weeks S-DATE
. O
He O
advanced O
without O
hesitation O
to O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
the O
moment O
the O
domestics O
had O
quitted O
the O
library O
and O
said O
, O
eagerly O
, O
but O
still O
respectfully O
— O
" O
Will O
you O
, O
too O
, O
forgive O
me O
, O
my O
dear O
father O

Mr. O
Morton S-PERSON
knows O
the O
whole O
truth O

and O
has O
not O
only O
pardoned O
my O
cruel O
folly O
, O
but O
assured O
me O
, O
that O
I O
have O
more O
than O
atoned O
for O
the O
pain O
my O
hateful O
verses O
inflicted O

that O
he O
will O
laugh O
at O
them O
himself O

declare O
he O
knows O
their O
author O
as O
a O
most O
particular O
friend O

which O
he O
hopes O
you O
will O
permit O
me O
to O
become O
— O
whenever O
he O
has O
the O
opportunity O

for O
that O
such O
notice O
of O
them O
will O
be O
the O
surest O
way O
to O
consign O
them O
to O
oblivion O

I O
have O
endured O
so O
much O
pain O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
few I-DATE
weeks E-DATE
that O
I O
do O
not O

shall O
be O
so O
thoughtless O

weak O
in O
a O
hurry O
again O
. O
Will O
you O
try O
me O
once O
more O
? O
" O
Astonished O
and O
touched O
, O
far O
more O
than O
he O
was O
ever O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
allowing O
himself O
to O
feel O
, O
much O
less O

display O
, O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
had O
some O
difficulty O
in O
replying O

his O
words O
were O
even O
more O
than O
satisfactory O
to O
his O
son's O
eager O
heart O

he O
answered O
earnestly O

I O
am O
quite O
sure O
, O
if O
it O
had O
not O
been O
for O
mamma's O
suggestion O
, O
I O
never O
could O
have O
done O
it O
. O
It O
might O
have O
crossed O
my O
mind O
, O
but O
I O
fear O
pride O
would O
not O
have O
permitted O
me O
to O
listen O
to O
it O
| | O
but O
when O
mamma O
put O
the O
case O
before O
me O
as O
she O
did O
, O
I O
could O
not O
prevent O
my O
conscience O
from O
feeling O
the O
truth O
of O
all O
she O
said O
, O
and O
if O
I O
had O
not O
followed O
her O
advice O
, O
I O
should O
have O
been O
more O
miserable O
still O
. O
Dearest O
mother O
, O
" O
he O
continued O
, O
as O
he O
turned O
with O
even O
more O
than O
his O
usual O
affection O
to O
receive O
her O
nightly O
embrace O
, O
" O
you O
have O
made O
me O
so O
happy O
! O
how O
can O
I O
thank O
you O
? O
" O
If O
she O
made O
him O
happy O
, O
he O
certainly O
had O
returned O
the O
blessing O
, O
for O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
had O
seldom O
felt O
more O
exquisite O
pleasure O
than O
she O
did O
at O
that O
moment O
| | O
and O
her O
little O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
though O
she O
could O
not O
quite O
understand O
all O
her O
mother's O
feelings O
, O
felt O
, O
in O
her O
way O
, O
almost O
as O
glad O
. O
" O
Well O
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
will O
not O
your O
son's O
words O
confirm O
mine O
? O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Grahame S-PERSON
trying O
to O
speak O
cheerfully O
, O
when O
the O
young O
party O
had O
retired O
, O
and O
he O
was O
again O
alone O
with O
his O
friends O
. O
" O
Can O
he O
go O
far O
wrong O
with O
such O
a O
friend O
? O
" O
" O
Indeed O
, O
he O
has O
done O
me O
more O
than O
justice O
, O
and O
himself O
not O
enough O
. O
When O
I O
left O
him O
, O
I O
had O
scarcely O
a O
hope O
that O
my O
very O
disagreeable O
advice O
would O
be O
followed O
| | O
besides O
, O
Mr. O
Grahame S-PERSON
, O
" O
she O
added O
, O
more O
playfully O
, O
" O
it O
was O
not O
from O
disagreeing O
with O
you O
on O
a O
mother's O
influence O
that O
my O
look O
reproached O
you O
, O
you O
know O
well O
enough O
what O
it O
meant O

and O
I O
still O
say O
, O
that O
even O
now O
, O
if O
you O
would O
but O
be O
less O
reserved O
and O
stern O
, O
would O
but O
see O
Helen's S-PERSON
many O
better O
qualities O
, O
as O
clearly O
as O
you O
do O
her O
faults O
, O
you O
might O
still O
win O
her O
to O
your O
will O
even O
with O
regard O
to O
your O
children O
. O
" O
" O
Not O
now O
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
it O
is O
too O
late O

but O
you O
have O
no O
idea O
how O
your O
look O
transported O
me O
back O
to O
years S-DATE
past O
, O
" O
he O
added O
, O
evidently O
resolved O
to O
change O
the O
subject O
, O
" O
when O
I O
actually O
almost O
feared O
to O
approach O
you O
. O
Do O
you O
remember O
, O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
when O
I O
told O
you O
, O
if O
Miss O
Manvers S-PERSON
had O
a O
fault O
, O
she O
was O
too O
cold O
? O
" O
" O
I O
shall O
not O
easily O
forget O
the O
incidents O
of O
that O
night O
, O
" O
replied O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
fond O
glance O
toward O
his O
wife O
. O
" O
Poor O
Eleanor S-PERSON
, O
when O
her O
conduct O
that O
evening O
fell O
under O
my O
lash O
, O
I O
little O
thought O
her O
orphan O
children O
would O
be O
living O
under O
my O
roof O
, O
and O
to O
me O
almost O
like O
my O
own O
. O
" O
" O
And O
one O
her O
very O
image O
, O
" O
observed O
Grahame S-PERSON
. O
" O
Does O
either O
resemble O
her O
in O
mind O
or O
disposition O
? O
" O
" O
Edward S-PERSON
almost O
as O
much O
in O
mind O
as O
in O
personal O
beauty O
, O
" O
replied O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
| | O
" O
But O
not O
in O
all O
points O
of O
his O
disposition O
. O
Ellen S-PERSON
does O
not O
resemble O
her O
poor O
mother O
in O
any O
thing O
. O
" O
" O
Is O
she O
like O
her O
father O
? O
" O
" O
I O
did O
not O
know O
him O
sufficiently O
to O
judge O
, O
but O
I O
fancy O
not O
. O
— O
In O
fact O
, O
I O
hardly O
yet O
understand O
Ellen S-PERSON
. O
" O
" O
Indeed O
! O
" O
answered O
Grahame S-PERSON
, O
smiling O
| | O
" O
is O
your O
penetrative O
genius O
here O
at O
fault O
? O
" O
" O
I O
fear O
it O
is O
, O
" O
she O
answered O
, O
in O
the O
same O
tone O
| | O
" O
Ellen S-PERSON
is O
my O
youngest O
child O
— O
and O
that O
which O
has O
been O
my O
successful O
help O
five S-CARDINAL
times O
, O
has O
become O
blunted O
at O
the O
sixth S-ORDINAL
, O
and O
refuses O
to O
aid O
me O
further O
. O
" O
" O
Grahame S-PERSON
, O
do O
not O
heed O
her O
, O
" O
interposed O
her O
husband O
, O
laughing O
| | O
" O
she O
fancies O
there O
is O
something O
extraordinary O
about O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
which O
she O
can O
not O
comprehend O
| | O
and O
I O
feel O
certain O
that O
imagination O
has O
been O
playing O
with O
my O
wife's O
sober O
judgment O
, O
and O
that O
our O
little O
niece O
is O
a O
very O
ordinary O
child O
, O
only O
rather O
more O
sad O
and O
quiet O
than O
is O
usual O
at O
her O
age O
, O
which O
may O
be O
easily O
accounted O
for O
by O
her O
early O
trials O
and O
constant O
ill O
- O
health O
. O
So O
I O
solve O
what O
my O
wife O
pronounces O
a O
mystery O
. O
She O
has O
so O
few O
fancies O
, O
however O
, O
that O
I O
do O
not O
quarrel O
with O
this O
, O
for O
it O
has O
all O
the O
charm O
of O
novelty O
. O
" O
There O
were O
more O
than O
usual O
subjects O
of O
thought O
on O
the O
minds O
of O
all O
the O
young O
inmates O
of O
Oakwood S-GPE
, O
before O
they O
went O
to O
sleep O
that O
night O
. O
Percy's S-PERSON
, O
Herbert's S-PERSON
, O
and O
Emmeline's S-PERSON
were O
all O
peculiarly O
happy O
and O
peaceful O
. O
Caroline's O
were O
not O
so O
agreeable O
. O
Praise O
lavished O
on O
others O
never O
gave O
her O
pleasure O
: O
the O
question O
would O
always O
come O
, O
Why O
did O
she O
not O
receive O
it O
too O
? O
It O
was O
very O
hard O
that O
she O
so O
seldom O
received O
it O
, O
and O
self O
- O
love O
was O
always O
ready O
to O
accuse O
her O
parents O
of O
some O
degree O
of O
partiality O
rather O
than O
herself O
of O
unworthiness O
. O
But O
these O
thoughts O
only O
came O
when O
she O
was O
alone O
| | O
the O
moment O
she O
heard O
her O
father's O
voice O
, O
or O
met O
her O
mother's O
smile O
, O
they O
fled O
from O
her O
till O
they O
were O
pertinaciously O
recalled O
. O
Ellen S-PERSON
thought O
mostly O
of O
Herbert S-PERSON
. O
She O
had O
been O
as O
curious O
as O
the O
rest O
to O
know O
where O
he O
had O
been O
, O
though O
she O
had O
not O
said O
so O
much O
about O
it O
. O
But O
that O
it O
was O
for O
some O
good O
, O
kind O
deed O
she O
had O
never O
doubted O
. O
" O
No O
wonder O
Mary S-PERSON
loves O
him O
so O
much O
, O
" O
she O
said O
internally O
| | O
" O
but O
how O
can O
I O
ever O
hope O
he O
will O
love O
one O
so O
often O
naughty O
as O
I O
am O
. O
If O
Edward S-PERSON
be O
so O
much O
superior O
, O
what O
must O
Herbert S-PERSON
be O
? O
How O
I O
wish O
I O
were O
his O
sister O
, O
and O
then O
he O
would O
love O
me O
, O
deserving O
or O
not O
. O
" O
That O
poor O
Ellen S-PERSON
was O
often O
thought O
, O
as O
she O
expressed O
it O
, O
" O
naughty O
" O
was O
true O

and O
it O
was O
this O
mingling O
of O
many O
apparent O
faults O
, O
especially O
disregard O
to O
her O
aunt's O
commands O
, O
and O
but O
too O
often O
endeavor O
to O
conceal O
and O
equivocate O
, O
instead O
of O
an O
open O
confession O
, O
with O
a O
sorrow O
and O
repentance O
too O
deep O
and O
painful O
for O
her O
years S-DATE
, O
that O
so O
fairly O
bewildered O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
and O
really O
, O
as O
she O
had O
told O
Mr. O
Grahame S-PERSON
, O
prevented O
her O
from O
understanding O
Ellen S-PERSON
. O
If O
she O
could O
but O
have O
known O
of O
that O
unfortunate O
promise O
, O
and O
the O
strong O
hold O
it O
had O
taken O
of O
the O
child's O
vivid O
imagination O
| | O
that O
by O
dwelling O
on O
it O
she O
had O
actually O
made O
herself O
believe O
that O
, O
by O
always O
shielding O
Edward S-PERSON
from O
blame O
or O
punishment O
, O
she O
was O
obeying O
and O
making O
her O
mother O
love O
her O
from O
Heaven O
, O
and O
so O
, O
still O
more O
deepening O
her O
father's O
affection O
for O
her O

and O
that O
this O
idea O
enabled O
her O
to O

the O
suffering O

that O
most O
painful O
of O
all O
punishments O
, O
her O
aunt's O
displeasure O

Mrs. O

would O
have O
left O
no O
means O
untried O
to O
remove O
such O
a O
mistaken O
impression O
, O
and O
no O
doubt O
would O
have O
succeeded O

but O
she O
had O
not O
the O
slightest O
conception O
of O
the O
real O
origin O
of O
her O
niece's O
incomprehensible O
contradictions O
. O
She O
had O
believed O

hoped O
the O
influences O
of O
her O
earlier O
life O
would O
disappear O
before O
the O
quiet O

wholesome O
routine O
of O
the O
present O

often O

often O
she O
found O
herself O
fearing O

only O
maternal O
neglect O

actual O
disposition O

When O
convinced O
of O
the O
great O
importance O
of O
truth O

Ellen S-PERSON
frequently O
, O
instead O
of O
attempting O
to O
conceal O
what O
Edward S-PERSON
might O
have O
heedlessly O
done O
, O
actually O
took O
it O
upon O
herself O

able O
to O
define O

describe O

chaos O
in O
the O
poor O
child's O
mind O

naughty O

she O
most O
wished O

good O

her O
aunt O
must O
think O
she O
did O
not O
care O
for O
her O
displeasure O

when O
it O
made O
her O
so O
very O

was O
scarcely O
ever O
in O

must O
not O
think O
Edward S-PERSON
very O
cowardly O
and O
very O
dishonorable O
, O
always O
to O
let O
his O
sister O
bear O
the O
penalty O
of O
his O
faults O
. O
He O
had O
never O
been O
taught O
, O
and O
therefore O
could O
not O
understand O
, O
the O
imperative O
necessity O
, O
when O
guilty O
of O
heedlessness O
or O
disobedience O
, O
boldly O
to O
step O
forward O
, O
whether O
others O
were O
injured O
or O
not O
, O
and O
avow O
it O
. O
He O
did O
not O
understand O
how O
not O
to O
say O
any O
thing O
about O
it O
, O
unless O
he O
was O
asked O
, O
could O
be O
a O
want O
of O
truth O
. O
It O
was O
also O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
constant O
custom O
never O
to O
mention O
to O
the O
members O
of O
her O
family O
, O
who O
might O
have O
been O
absent O
at O
the O
time O
, O
any O
thing O
of O
fault O
or O
disgrace O
which O
had O
fallen O
under O
her O
own O
immediate O
jurisdiction O
, O
unless O
their O
nature O
absolutely O
demanded O
it O
| | O
and O
the O
absence O
of O
the O
young O
offenders O
from O
the O
happy O
family O
circle O
, O
either O
at O
meals O
or O
hours O
of O
recreation O
, O
when O
such O
an O
unusual O
proceeding O
was O
necessary O
, O
in O
consequence O
, O
never O
excited O
any O
remark O
, O
but O
a O
very O
general O
feeling O
of O
regret O
. O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
therefore O
, O
scarcely O
ever O
heard O
the O
actual O
cause O
of O
his O
sister's O
disgrace O
, O
and O
sometimes O
did O
not O
even O
know O
she O
had O
incurred O
it O
. O
He O
did O
, O
indeed O
, O
when O
she O
was O
sometimes O
absent O
, O
feel O
very O
uncomfortable O
| | O
but O
his O
immovable O
awe O
of O
his O
really O
indulgent O
uncle O
( O
an O
impression O
of O
his O
mother's O
creating O
, O
quite O
as O
strong O
as O
Ellen's S-PERSON
idea O
of O
the O
sanctity O
of O
her O
promise O
) O
caused O
him O
to O
adopt O
every O
means O
of O
removing O
the O
uncomfortable O
consciousness O
that O
he O
was O
far O
more O
to O
blame O
than O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
but O
the O
right O
one O
, O
a O
fearless O
inquiry O
as O
to O
why O
she O
was O
punished O
, O
and O
an O
open O
avowal O
that O
it O
was O
he O
who O
had O
either O
led O
her O
into O
error O
, O
or O
was O
the O
real O
offender O
. O
His O
thoughts O
on O
Percy's S-PERSON
conduct O
were O
very O
different O
to O
those O
of O
his O
cousins O
. O
" O
No O
! O
" O
he O
exclaimed O
, O
almost O
aloud O
, O
in O
the O
energy O
of O
his O
feelings O
, O
" O
no O
! O
I O
would O
have O
suffered O
any O
thing O
, O
every O
thing O
, O
rather O
than O
have O
done O
this O
— O
seek O
Mr. O
Morton S-PERSON
, O
humble O
myself O
by O
avowing O
the O
truth O
to O
him O
, O
and O
ask O
his O
pardon O
for O
a O
mere O
clever O
joke O
, O
that O
Percy S-PERSON
ought O
to O
have O
been O
proud O
of O
, O
instead O
of O
regretting O
! O
If O
I O
did O
not O
know O
him O
well O

I O
should O
believe O

a O
craven O

without O
a O
particle O

What O
could O
have O
possessed O
him O

— O
my O
uncle's O
look O
must O
have O
frightened O
him O
out O
of O
his O
sober O
senses O

to O
be O
sure O
it O
was O
very O
terrible O

poor O
mamma O
was O
, O
indeed O
, O
right O
as O
to O
his O
unbending O
sternness O

but O
I O
think O
I O
could O
have O
dared O
even O
his O
anger O

rather O
than O
beg O
Mr. O

pardon O

there O
really O
was O
no O

sleep O
overtook O
him O

with O
the O
firm O
conviction O
resting O
on O
his O
mind O
, O
that O
though O
in O
some O
things O
Percy S-PERSON

yet O
in O

considered O
the O

now O
that O

to O
fancy O
herself O
very O
much O
too O
old O
for O
only O

Mr. O

did O
not O
allow O

The O
season O
was O
to O
their O
feelings O

one O
of O
earnest O

intense O
thankfulness O

just O

Edward B-PERSON

would O
be O
in O
a B-DATE
very I-DATE
few I-DATE
months E-DATE

but O
his O
uncle O

Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
had O
only O
told O
him O
to O
work O
on O
as O
hard O
as O
he O
could O
, O
for O
the O
summons O
might O
come O
for O
him O
to O
join O
at O
a O
very O
short O
notice O

it O
would O
be O
very O
dreadful O
, O
if O
the O
commission O
should O
be O
refused O
because O
his O
guardians O
did O
not O
think O
him O
forward O
enough O
in O
his O
various O
studies O
to O
leave O
them O

They O
had O
looked O
very O
mischievous O
when O
they O
had O
told O
him O
this O

Edward S-PERSON
had O
enjoyed O
the O
joke O

resolved O

should O
not O

any O
such O
amusement O

would O
go O
to O
sea O

he O
worked O
night O

day O
for O
the O
privilege O

he O
really O
did O
so O
well O
, O
that O
his O
uncle O
gave O
him O
great O
praise O
, O
which O
was O
as O
unexpected O

delightful O

his O
anger O
was O
terrible O

happened O

on O
the O
morning O
after O
Christmas B-DATE

Edward S-PERSON

had O
read O
it O
a O
few O
evenings O
previous O

something O
had O
crossed O
him O

in O
a O
desperate O
passion O

had O
flung O
the O
book O
from O
him O

where O
it O
fell O

neither O

mother O

asked O

received O
permission O

put O
some O
seeds O

her O
little O
garden O

Percy S-PERSON

kindly O

to O

He O
was O

still O
engaged O
with O
his O
father O

would O
be O

had O
told O
her O

for O
perhaps O
an O
hour O
longer O

he O
would O
be O
sure O
to O
come O

her O

entirely O
engrossed O
her O

nearly B-TIME
half I-TIME

hunted O
in O

a O
very O
desponding O
tone O

impatiently O

filled O

some O
few O
rare O
myrtles O

" O
There O

said O
Edward S-PERSON
joyfully O

" O
Oh O

that O

you O

us O
not O

implored O
Ellen S-PERSON

clinging O
to O
his O
arm O

" O

the O

all O
Caroline's O

Edward S-PERSON
— O

pray O
, O
don't O

you O
know O
how O
displeased O
she O
was O
with O
Emmeline S-PERSON
last B-DATE
week E-DATE

a O
much O
more O

this O

if O
any O

happen O
to O
the O

Caroline S-PERSON
will O
be O
so O
angry O

" O
" O
And O
what O
do O
I O
care O
for O
Caroline's S-PERSON
anger O

" O
retorted O
Edward S-PERSON
impatiently O

" O
My O
uncle's O
indeed O
is O
something O

care O
about O

I O

get O
my O

in O
this O

is O
no O

am O
sure O
I O
can O

any O

I O

my O

only O
wait O

home O

at O

let O
me O
ask O
uncle O

may O
move O
it O

me O
go O
— O
I O
will O
not O

a O

so O
betray O
my O
being O
in O
a O
passion O
the O
other O
day O

get O
me O
a O
reproof O
for O
that O

for O
my O
carelessness O
into O
the O
bargain O

Nonsense O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON

I O
will O
get O
it O

, O
you O
must O

not O
a O

lose O

" O
" O
No O

Edward S-PERSON
! O
indeed O
, O
indeed O
, O

can O
not O
touch O
it O

she O
replied O
imploringly O
, O

shrinking O
back O
. O
" O
Say O
, O
rather O
, O
you O
wish O
to O
get O
me O
into O
disgrace O

perhaps O
prevented O
from O
going O
out O
this O
evening O
, O

to O
- O
morrow O
, O

Friday S-DATE
too O

exclaimed O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
irritated O
beyond O
all O
forbearance O

" O
and O
the O
other O
day O
you O
were O
so O
very O
sorry O
I O
was O
going O
from O
home O
so O
soon O

much O
you O
must O
care O
about O
me O

that O
you O
can O
not O
do O
such O
a O
trifling O
thing O
as O
this O
to O
oblige O
me O
! O
I O
hate O
deceit O
. O
" O
Ellen S-PERSON
made O
no O
reply O
, O
though O
the O
tears O
started O
to O
her O
eyes O
| | O
but O
as O
usual O
her O
firmness O
deserted O
her O
. O
The O
heavy O
stand O
was O
carefully O
moved O
a O
little O
forward O
, O
without O
injuring O
any O
of O
the O
plants O
| | O
the O
book O
was O
obtained O
, O
and O
at O
that O
moment O
the O
voice O
of O
Percy S-PERSON
was O
heard O
exclaiming O
— O
" O
Edward S-PERSON
! O
Edward S-PERSON
! O
what O
are O
you O
about O
? O
papa O
has O
been O
expecting O

you O
will O
not O
have O
time O
to O
do O
all O
you O
wish O
— O
what O
can O
you O
be O
about O
? O
" O
Edward S-PERSON
did O
not O
wait O
to O
hear O
much O
more O
than O
his O
name O
, O
but O
darted O
off O
, O
leaving O
his O
sister O
to O
push O
back O
the O
stand O
. O
Ellen S-PERSON
felt O
almost O
sure O
she O
could O
not O
do O
it O
by O
herself O
| | O
but O
how O
was O
she O
to O
act O
? O
To O
ask O
assistance O
would O
not O
only O
be O
confessing O
her O
own O
disobedience O
, O
but O
inculpating O
her O
brother O
, O
and O
really O
, O
perhaps O
, O
deprive O
him O
of O
the O
enjoyments O
he O
anticipated O
, O
and O
so O
confirm O
his O
unkind O
words O
. O
She O
tried O
to O
replace O
it O
, O
and O
thought O
she O
had O
quite O
succeeded O
| | O
but O
as O
she O
moved O
it O
, O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
myrtles O
fell O
to O
the O
ground O
, O
and O
its O
beautiful O
blossom O
hung O
on O
the O
stalk O
, O
preserved O
from O
being O
quite O
broken O
off O
only O
by O
three S-CARDINAL
or O
four S-CARDINAL
delicate O
fibers O
. O
It O
was O
Caroline's O
favorite O
plant O
| | O
one O
she O
so O
cherished O
and O
tended O
, O
that O
Percy S-PERSON
called O
it O
her O
petted O
child O
| | O
and O
poor O
Ellen S-PERSON
stood O
paralyzed O
| | O
she O
raised O
the O
pot O
mechanically O
, O
and O
rested O
the O
broken O
head O
of O
the O
flower O
against O
the O
still O
uninjured O
sprig O
, O
and O
it O
looked O
so O
well O
and O
natural O
, O
that O
the O
thought O
for O
a O
moment O
darted O
across O
her O
mind O
that O
after O
all O
it O
might O
not O
be O
discovered O
. O
Then O
came O
all O
her O
aunt's O
lessons O
of O
the O
many O
ways O
of O
acting O
an O
untruth O
without O
words O
, O
and O
, O
therefore O
, O
even O
if O
it O
should O
not O
be O
discovered O
, O
it O
was O
no O
comfort O
| | O
but O
could O
she O
, O
dared O
she O
, O
voluntarily O
confess O
what O
must O
appear O
a O
willful O
disobedience O
? O
If O
her O
aunt O
had O
been O
at O
home O
, O
she O
might O
in O
that O
first S-ORDINAL
moment O
have O
gained O
the O
necessary O
courage O
| | O
but O
she O
was O
not O
expected O
back O
for O
two B-TIME
or I-TIME
three I-TIME
hours E-TIME
, O
and O
Ellen S-PERSON
sat O
with O
her O
face O
buried O
in O
her O
hands O
, O
only O
conscious O
of O
misery O
, O
till O
her O
cousin's O
joyous O
voice O
called O
out O
from O
the O
hall O
— O
" O
Come O
along O
, O
Nelly S-PERSON
, O
I O
have O
kept O
you O
long O
enough O
| | O
Tiny O
would O
never O
have O
left O
me O
quiet O
so O
long O
| | O
but O
there O
is O
no O
tiring O
your O
patience O
. O
However O
, O
I O
will O
make O
up O
for O
it O
now O
. O
" O
And O
glad O
to O
escape O
from O
her O
own O
thoughts O
, O
she O
hastily O
collected O
the O
various O
seeds O
, O
and O
ran O
after O
him O
. O
And O
Percy S-PERSON
was O
so O
active O
, O
so O
obliging O
, O
so O
amusing O
in O
his O
queer O
ways O
of O
working O
and O
talking O
, O
that O
she O
almost O
forgot O
the O
impending O
trial O
, O
till O
she O
met O
her O
aunt O
and O
cousins O
at O
luncheon O
. O
Edward S-PERSON
had O
been O
so O
intent O
, O
so O
happy O
at O
his O
business O
with O
his O
uncle O
, O
that O
he O
had O
never O
cast O
a O
thought O
as O
to O
how O
the O
stand O
got O
back O
| | O
and O
after O
lunch O
he O
had O
to O
go O
for O
a O
row O
on O
the O
river O
, O
and O
after O
dinner O
to O
attend O
a O
lecture O
on O
astronomy O
, O
which O
, O
that O
night O
and O
the O
one S-CARDINAL
following O
, O
was O
to O
be O
given O
in O
the O
town O
- O
hall O
in O
T O
— O
. O
His O
uncle O
and O
Percy S-PERSON
and O
Herbert S-PERSON
were O
to O
accompany O
him O
, O
and O
so O
, O
that O
he O
should O
give O
a O
thought O
to O
any O
thing O
disagreeable O
, O
was O
not O
likely O
. O
The O
day O
wore O
on O
| | O
Ellen's S-PERSON
little O
courage O
had O
all O
gone O
, O
and O
she O
almost O
unconsciously O
hoped O
that O
nothing O
would O
be O
discovered O
. O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
and O
the O
lads O
departed O
at O
six S-CARDINAL
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
proposed O
adjourning O
to O
her O
daughters' O
room O
, O
to O
finish O
an O
entertaining O
book O
that O
they O
were O
reading O
aloud O
. O
She O
had O
noticed O
, O
with O
her O
usual O
penetration O
, O
that O
all O
day O
Ellen S-PERSON
evidently O
shrunk O
from O
her O
eye O
, O
and O
felt O
quite O
sure O
something O
was O
wrong O
again O
| | O
but O
she O
asked O
no O
questions O
, O
fearing O
again O
to O
tempt O
equivocation O
. O
Caroline's S-PERSON
passionate O
exclamation O
that O
somebody O
had O
broken O
her O
beautiful O
flower O
, O
drew O
the O
attention O
of O
all O
to O
the O
stand O
, O
and O
one S-CARDINAL
glance O
sufficed O
to O
tell O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
that O
it O
had O
been O
moved O
. O
Her O
anxious O
suspicions O
at O
once O
connected O
this O
with O
Ellen's S-PERSON
shrinking O
manner O
, O
and O
she O
turned O
to O
ask O
her O
if O
she O
knew O
any O
thing O
about O
it O
. O
But O
Ellen S-PERSON
had O
disappeared O
| | O
and O
she O
rang O
the O
bell O
, O
and O
inquired O
of O
the O
only O
domestics O
whose O
department O
ever O
led O
them O
into O
the O
room O
, O
if O
they O
could O
explain O
the O
accident O
. O
But O
neither O
of O
them O
could O
| | O
all O
uniting O
in O
declaring O
, O
that O
in O
the O
morning O
the O
myrtle O
was O
quite O
perfect O
. O
" O
Ellen S-PERSON
was O
at O
home O
, O
mamma O
| | O
she O
must O
know O
something O
about O
it O
. O
Percy S-PERSON
said O
they O
did O
not O
begin O
gardening O
till O
more B-TIME
than I-TIME
an I-TIME
hour E-TIME
after O
we O
were O
gone O
, O
" O
exclaimed O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
whose O
temper O
was O
sorely O
tried O
by O
this O
downfall O
of O
all O
her O
cares O
. O
" O
I O
dare O
say O
she O
did O
it O
herself O
— O
spiteful O
thing O
! O
— O
and O
has O
gone O
to O
hide O
herself O
rather O
than O
confess O
it O
— O
it O
is O
just O
like O
her O
! O
" O
" O
Stop O
, O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
do O
not O
condemn O
till O
you O
are O
quite O
certain O
| | O
and O
do O
not O
in O
your O
anger O
say O
what O
is O
not O
true O
. O
Ellen S-PERSON
has O
given O
no O
evidence O
as O
yet O
of O
being O
spiteful O
or O
mischievous O
. O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
go O
and O
tell O
your O
cousin O
that O
I O
want O
her O
. O
" O
The O
child O
obeyed O
. O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
had O
continued O
working O
most O
industriously O
at O
the O
table O
, O
without O
uttering O
a O
word O
, O
though O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
countenance O
expressed O
such O
unusual O
perplexity O
and O
pain O
, O
that O
it O
would O
have O
seemed O
kinder O
to O
have O
spoken O
. O
One S-CARDINAL
look O
at O
Ellen S-PERSON
convinced O
her O
aunt O
, O
and O
she O
actually O
paused O
before O
she O
spoke O
, O
dreading O
the O
reply O
almost O
as O
much O
as O
the O
child O
did O
the O
question O
. O
It O
was O
scarcely O
audible O
| | O
it O
might O
have O
been O
denial O
, O
it O
certainly O
was O
not O
affirmative O
, O
for O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
instantly O
exclaimed O
— O
" O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
how O
can O
you O
tell O
such O
a O
deliberate O
falsehood O
? O
I O
would O
not O
tell O
your O
aunt O
, O
for O
I O
really O
wished O
you O
to O
have O
the O
opportunity O
of O
in O
some O
degree O
redeeming O
your O
disobedience O

but O
I O
saw O
you O
move O
back O
the O
stand O

and O
your O
sinful O
attempt O
at O

you O

the O
intention O

concealing O
it O

" O
exclaimed O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
bursting O
into O
tears O

for O
that O
one S-CARDINAL
unjust O
charge O
seemed O
to O
give O
back O
the O
power O
of O
speech O
, O
though O
the O
violent O
reproach O
and O
invective O
which O
burst O
from O
Caroline S-PERSON
prevented O
any O
thing O
further O
. O
" O
I O
must O
beg O
you O

silent O

your O

said O
her O
mother O
, O
quietly O

" O
the O
fate O
of O
your O

both O
disobeyed O

again O
tried O

deceive O
me O

faults O

it O
is O
my O
duty O

chastise O

Ellen S-PERSON

at O
once O

briefly O

your O
fault O

known O

, O
therefore O

all O
further O
equivocation O

Yes O

" O
replied O
the O
child O
, O
almost O
choked O
with O
sobs O
, O
called O
forth O
the O
more O
from O
the O
contrast O
which O
her O
aunt's O
mildness O
presented O
to O
Miss O
Harcourt's S-PERSON
harshness O

Caroline's S-PERSON
violent O
anger O

from O
the O
painful O
longing O
to O
say O
that O
her O
first S-ORDINAL

not O
entirely O
her O

Ellen S-PERSON
again O
, O

an O
exclamation O
at O
the O
apparent O
hardihood O
of O
her O
conduct O
escaped O
from O
both O
Miss O

" O

yet O
you O
persisted O

Ellen S-PERSON

For O
full B-TIME
a I-TIME
minute E-TIME
Ellen S-PERSON
hesitated O

thus O
unhappily O
confirming O
the O
suspicion O
that O
when O

did O
reply O
it O
was O
another O
equivocation O

Ellen S-PERSON

it O
was O
several B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
before O
Mrs. O

could O
sufficiently O
conquer O
the O
very O
painful O
feelings O

her O
niece's O
conduct O

her O
own O
compelled O

gradually O
returned O

their O

was O
Edward's S-PERSON
grief O

consternation O

not O
sufficient O
boldness O

expressly O
said O
it O

the O
untruth O

forgiven O
it O

a O
very O
slight O
rebuke O

such O

deliberate O
story O

equal O
deliberation O

of O
far O
more O
culpability O

was O
permitting O

the O
whole O
weight O

went O
to O
his O
sister O

to O
confess O
his O
share O

her O
fault O

— O
as O
he O
fully O
expected O

begged O
him O
not O

that O
it O

do O
her O
no O

perhaps O
only O
get O
him O
punished O
too O

conscience O
was O
so O
perfectly O
satisfied O

took O
upon O
himself O

foolish O

wrong O

almost O
with O
irritation O

satisfied O

disagreeable O
thought O

temptation O

sought O
a O
variety O

get O

continuation O

morning O
brought O
so O
many O
enjoyments O

nothing O

firmness O
in O
inflicting O
pain O

whenever O
it O

committed O

" O
The O
tone O
and O
words O
were O
so O
earnest O
, O
so O
sad O
, O
that O
not O
only O
did O
her O
children O
cease O
in O
their O
intercession O
, O
but O
all O
felt O
still O
more O
forcibly O
the O
solemn O
importance O
of O
the O
virtue O
, O
in O
which O
Ellen S-PERSON
had O
so O
failed O
, O
from O
the O
effect O
of O
her O
conduct O
upon O
their O
mother O
. O
She O
was O
always O
grieved O
when O
they O
had O
done O
wrong O
, O
but O
they O
never O
remembered O
seeing O
her O
so O
very O
sad O
as O
now O
. O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
indeed O
, O
could O
scarcely O
understand O
this O
as O
his O
cousins O
did O
| | O
but O
as O
his O
aunt O
still O
only O
alluded O
to O
the O
untruth O
, O
the O
qualm O
of O
conscience O
was O
again O
silenced O
, O
for O
he O
had O
only O
caused O
the O
disobedience O
. O
Emmeline S-PERSON
asked O
timidly O
if O
she O
might O
remain O
with O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
and O
Edward S-PERSON
followed O
her O
example O
, O
thinking O
himself O
very O
magnanimous O
in O
so O
doing O
| | O
but O
both O
were O
refused O
— O
and O
surely O
he O
had O
done O
enough O
! O
All O
went O
— O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
and O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
young O
people O
| | O
and O
it O
was O
such O
a O
happy O
evening O
! O
First S-ORDINAL
, O
there O
was O
the O
orrery O
, O
that O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
had O
prevailed O
on O
the O
lecturer O
to O
display O
first S-ORDINAL
at O
his O
house O
, O
and O
Edward S-PERSON
was O
almost O
wild O
in O
his O
delight O
| | O
and O
then O
there O
were O
some O
games O
and O
intellectual O
puzzles O
, O
that O
made O
them O
all O
think O
, O
as O
well O
as O
enjoy O
| | O
and O
then O
there O
were O
some O
music O
and O
singing O
and O
dancing O
, O
and O
every O
thing O
was O
so O
quiet O
and O
orderly O
, O
and O
yet O
so O
full O
of O
youthful O
enjoyment O
, O
that O
it O
was O
not O
much O
wonder O
there O
was O
no O
longer O
any O
room O
for O
a O
sorrowful O
thought O
, O
in O
any O
of O
the O
young O
party O
from O
Oakwood S-GPE
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
alone O
thought O
of O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
and O
again O
and O
again O
accused O
herself O
of O
too O
great O
harshness O
| | O
for O
, O
perhaps O
, O
after O
all O
, O
it O
might O
have O
no O
better O
effect O
than O
kindness O
| | O
but O
what O
could O
she O
do O
? O
She O
almost O
envied O
the O
quiet O
, O
unruffled O
unconcern O
of O
less O
anxious O
guardians O
| | O
but O
for O
her O
to O
feel O
indifferent O
to O
her O
responsibility O
was O
impossible O
. O
Ellen S-PERSON
was O
so O
often O
unwell O
that O
her O
absence O
did O
not O
occasion O
so O
much O
remark O
as O
her O
brother's O
or O
either O
of O
her O
cousins' O
would O
. O
" O
Mamma O
did O
not O
wish O
her O
to O
come O
, O
" O
was O
the O
answer O
she O
had O
desired O
the O
children O
to O
give O
to O
any O
inquiries O
, O
and O
her O
character O
for O
indulgence O
was O
so O
generally O
known O
, O
that O
no O
one O
suspected O
any O
thing O
more O
than O
indisposition O
. O
Annie B-PERSON
Grahame's E-PERSON
dislike O
to O
Ellen S-PERSON
might O
have O
made O
her O
more O
suspicious O
, O
but O
she O
was O
not O
there O
. O
Cecil S-PERSON
and O
Lilla S-PERSON
were O
, O
with O
their O
father O
, O
but O
Miss O
Grahame S-PERSON
did O
not O
condescend O
to O
attend O
Mr. O
Howard's S-PERSON
" O
juvenile O

and O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
though O
she O
would O
not O
have O
allowed O
it O
, O
even O
to O
herself O
, O
was O
both O
happier O

much O
more O
inclined O

The B-TIME

to O
Ellen's S-PERSON
disposition O

was O
a O
greater O
trial O

the O
Friday S-DATE

She O
neither O
expected O

hardly O
wished O

allowed O
to O
go O
to O
Mr. O

the O
affectionate O
Emmeline S-PERSON
had O
come O
to O
wish O
her O
good O
night O
, O
and O
with O
tears O
in O
her O
eyes O
repeated O
the O
regrets O
that O
she O
was O
not O
to O
go O
, O
she O
felt O
the O
bitter O
disappointment O
more O
than O
in O
the O
morning O
she O
had O
thought O
possible O

but O
Saturday O
night O
it O
had O
been O
her O
aunt's O
custom O
, O
from O
the O
time O
she O
had O
been O
at O
Oakwood S-GPE
, O
to O
visit O
her O
daughters O

niece O
before O
they O
went O
to O
sleep O

prepare O
them O
for O
the O
Sabbath's O
rest O

by O
an O
examination O

and O
full O
forgiveness O

When O
younger O

attended O
to O
this O
duty O
every O
night O

private O
prayer O

self O
- O
examination O
, O
independent O
of O

she O
had O
, O
after O
Emmeline S-PERSON
was O
twelve B-DATE
years I-DATE

set O
apart O
the O
Saturday O
night O
, O
until O
they O
were O
fifteen S-DATE
— O
old O
enough O
for O
her O
to O
relinquish O
it O
altogether O
. O
It O
had O
been O
such O
a O
habit O
with O
her O
own O
children O
, O
that O
they O
felt O
it O
perfectly O
natural O

but O
with O
Ellen S-PERSON
and O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
from O
their O
never O
having O
been O
accustomed O
to O
it O
as O
young O
children O

never O

as O
satisfactorily O
performed O
by O
herself O
as O
with O
her O
own O
. O
Still O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
looked O
forward O
to O
this O
night O
as O
the O
termination O
of O
her O
banishment O

for O
great O
indeed O
was O
the O
offense O
whose O
correction O
extended O
over O
the O
Sabbath O
. O
Ellen S-PERSON
could O
not O
remember O
one S-CARDINAL
instance O
since O
she O
had O
been O
at O
Oakwood S-GPE
, O
and O
when O
she O
heard O
the O
doors O
of O
her O
cousins' O
rooms O
successively O
close O
, O
and O
her O
aunt's O
step O
retreating O
without O
approaching O
hers O
, O
she O
did O
, O
indeed O
, O
believe O
herself O
irreclaimably O
wicked O
, O
or O
her O
kind O
, O
good O
aunt O
, O
would O
, O
at O
least O
, O
have O
come O
to O
her O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
had O
purposely O
refrained O
from O
indulging O
her O
own O
inclinations O
, O
as O
well O
as O
comforting O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
hoping O
still O
more O
to O
impress O
upon O
her O
how O
greatly O
she O
had O
sinned O
. O
The O
impossibility O
of O
her O
perfectly O
comprehending O
her O
niece's O
character O
, O
while O
the O
poor O
child O
felt O
it O
such O
a O
sacred O
duty O
to O
victimize O
herself O
, O
made O
her O
far O
more O
severe O
than O
she O
would O
have O
been O
, O
could O
she O
have O
known O
her O
real O
disposition O

how O
was O
it O
possible O
she O
could O
believe O
Ellen's S-PERSON
grief O
as O
deep O
and O
remorseful O
as O
it O
seemed O
, O
when O
a O
short O
time O
afterward O
she O
would O
commit O
the O
same O
faults O
? O
Her O
task O
was O
infinitely O
more O
difficult O

perplexing O

less O
anxious O
mothers O
can O
have O
the O

the O
next O

she O
rose O

with O
that O
painful O
throbbing O
in O
her O
throat O

which O
always O
ended O
with O
one O
of O

went O

" O

His O

not O

shrinking O
from O
the O
look O
which O
Mrs. O

who O
was O
passing O
at O

Edward S-PERSON
again O

himself O

that O
the O
uncomfortable O

self O

so O
he O
vented O
it O
more O
than O
once O
in O
irritation O
against O
Ellen S-PERSON

declaring O
it O

, O
generally O
spent O
the O
greater O
part O
of O
Sunday S-DATE
with O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
, O
with O
his O
parents' O
glad O
and O
full O
consent O
. O
The O
contemplation O
of O
serious O
things O
was O
his O
greatest O
happiness O
, O
but O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
did O
not O
expect O
that O
all O
their O
other O
children O
were O
to O
be O
like O
him O
. O
They O
were O
contented O
, O
and O
intensely O
thankful O
also O
, O
to O
perceive O
that O
diverse O
as O
were O
their O
characters O
, O
still O
the O
constant O
sense O
of O
God's O
presence O
and O
of O
His O
infinite O
love O
was O
active O
and O
earnest O
in O
them O
all O
, O
inciting O
love O
and O
reverence O
for O
Herbert S-PERSON
, O
even O
though O
they O
could O
not O
sympathize O
with O
him O
entirely O
. O
Another O
peculiarity O
of O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
consisted O
in O
his O
permitting O
no O
Sunday S-DATE
schools O
at O
Aveling S-ORG
and O
his O
other O
villages O
. O
The O
Saturday S-DATE
afternoons O
were O
set O
apart O
instead O
of O
the O
Sunday S-DATE
. O
He O
wished O
his O
wife O
, O
and O
daughters O
when O
they O
were O
old O
enough O
, O
to O
superintend O
them O
, O
and O
help O
the O
children O
in O
preparing O
for O
the O
Sunday S-DATE
services O
and O
Sunday S-DATE
enjoyments O
| | O
but O
he O
particularly O
disliked O
the O
system O
of O
overwork O
on O
a O
day O
of O
rest O
, O
which O
could O
not O
fail O
to O
be O
the O
case O
, O
if O
there O
were O
schools O
to O
attend O
to O
twice O
or O
three S-CARDINAL
times O
a O
day O
, O
as O
well O
as O
church O
. O
It O
being O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
day I-DATE
of I-DATE
the I-DATE
old I-DATE
year E-DATE
, O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
had O
expressed O
a O
wish O
that O
Percy S-PERSON
and O
Edward S-PERSON
as O
well O
as O
Herbert S-PERSON
should O
attend O
church O
that O
afternoon O
, O
and O
the O
lads O
, O
without O
the O
least O
reluctance O
, O
consented O
| | O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
and O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
were O
going O
too O
, O
and O
Caroline S-PERSON
and O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
of O
their O
own O
accord O
, O
asked O
permission O
to O
accompany O
them O
. O
Ellen's S-PERSON
pale O
, O
suffering O
face O
had O
so O
haunted O
her O
aunt O
, O
that O
she O
could O
not O
think O
of O
any O
thing O
else O
, O
and O
remained O
for O
a O
very O
much O
longer O
time O
than O
was O
usual O
to O
her O
character O
in O
a O
state O
of O
indecision O
. O
The O
next O
night O
was O
her O
children's O
ball O
, O
and O
it O
was O
too O
, O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
day O
of O
the O
new O
year O
— O
always O
in O
her O
happy O
circle O
a O
festival O
of O
joy O
and O
thankfulness O
. O
Ellen's S-PERSON
face O
certainly O
looked O
as O
if O
she O
had O
suffered O
quite O
enough O
to O
prevent O
the O
recurrence O
of O
her O
fault O
, O
but O
so O
it O
had O
always O
done O
, O
and O
yet O
, O
before O
she O
could O
possibly O
have O
forgotten O
its O
consequences O
, O
she O
failed O
again O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
sat O
for O
some O
time O
, O
after O
her O
children O
had O
left O
her O
, O
in O
meditation O
, O
trying O
to O
silence O
the O
pleadings O
of O
affection O
, O
and O
listen O
only O
to O
reason O
, O
as O
to O
whether O
continued O
severity O
or O
returning O
kindness O
would O
be O
the O
more O
effective O
, O
and O
save O
both O
Ellen S-PERSON
and O
herself O
any O
further O
pain O
. O
To O
the O
child O
herself O
physical O
suffering O
was O
so O
increasing O
as O
gradually O
to O
deaden O
mental O
, O
till O
at O
last O
it O
became O
so O
severe O
, O
that O
she O
felt O
sick O
and O
faint O
. O
She O
knew O
the O
medicine O
she O
was O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
taking O
when O
similarly O
suffering O
, O
and O
the O
lotion O
which O
her O
aunt O
applied O
to O
her O
forehead O
, O
and O
which O
always O
succeeded O
in O
removing O
the O
excessive O
throbbing O
, O
were O
both O
in O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
dressing O
- O
room O
| | O
but O
it O
seemed O
quite O
impossible O
that O
she O
could O
get O
at O
them O
, O
for O
she O
did O
not O
like O
to O
leave O
her O
room O
without O
permission O
, O
nor O
did O
she O
feel O
as O
if O
she O
could O
walk O
so O
far O
, O
her O
head O
throbbing O
with O
increased O
violence O
with O
every O
step O
she O
took O
. O
At O
length O
she O
summoned O
sufficient O
courage O
to O
ring O
the O
bell O
, O
and O
beg O
Fanny S-PERSON
to O
ask O
Ellis S-PERSON
to O
come O
to O
her O
. O
The O
girl O
, O
who O
had O
been O
already O
dreadfully O
concerned O
that O
Miss O
Ellen S-PERSON
had O
eaten O
no O
dinner O
, O
and O
on O
Sunday S-DATE
too O
! O
gave O
such O
an O
account O
of O
her O
, O
that O
the O
housekeeper O
hastened O
to O
her O
directly O
, O
and O
begged O
her O
to O
let O
her O
go O
for O
her O
mistress O
— O
it O
was O
so O
lucky O
she O
had O
not O
gone O
to O
church O
— O
but O
Ellen S-PERSON
clung O
to O
her O
, O
imploring O
her O
not O
. O
" O
Dear O
, O
dear O
Ellis S-PERSON
, O
get O
me O
the O
medicine O
, O
and O
bathe O
my O
forehead O
yourself O
| | O
I O
shall O
get O
well O
then O
in O
an O
hour O
or O
two S-CARDINAL
, O
without O
giving O
my O
aunt O
any O
trouble O
| | O
pray O
, O
pray O
, O
don't O
tell O
her O
. O
I O
scarcely O
feel O
the O
pain O
when O
she O
is O
nursing O
and O
soothing O
me O
| | O
but O
I O
do O
not O
deserve O
that O
now O
, O
and O
I O
am O
afraid O
I O
never O
shall O
. O
" O
" O
But O
indeed O
, O
Miss O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
she O
will O
be O
displeased O
if O
I O
do O
not O
. O
Why O
, O
only O
the O
other O
morning O
she O
was O
quite O
concerned O
that O
I O
had O
not O
told O
her O
Jane S-PERSON
was O
ill O
directly O
, O
and O
went O
herself O
two S-CARDINAL
or O
three S-CARDINAL
times O
every O
day O
to O
see O
she O
had O
every O
thing O
proper O
and O
comfortable O
. O
" O
" O
But O
that O
is O
quite O
different O
, O
dear O
Ellis S-PERSON
| | O
do O
get O
the O
lotion O
| | O
I O
feel O
as O
if O
I O
could O
not O
bear O
this O
pain O
much O
longer O
without O
crying O
| | O
you O
can O
tell O
her O
afterward O
, O
if O
you O
think O
you O
ought O
. O
" O
And O
seeing O
that O
farther O
argument O
only O
increased O
the O
poor O
child's O
sufferings O
, O
Ellis S-PERSON
promised O
, O
and O
left O
her O
. O
Ellen S-PERSON
leaned O
her O
forehead O
against O
the O
side O
of O
her O
little O
bed O
, O
and O
held O
the O
curtain O
tightly O
clasped O
, O
as O
if O
so O
to O
prevent O
the O
utterance O
of O
the O
hysteric O
sob O
that O
would O
rise O
in O
her O
throat O
, O
though O
she O
did O
not O
know O
what O
it O
was O
. O
But O
the O
wholly O
unexpected O
sound O
of O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
voice O
saying O
, O
close O
by O
her O
, O
" O
I O
am O
afraid O
you O
have O
one O
of O
your O
very O
bad O
headaches O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
" O
so O
startled O
her O
, O
as O
to O
make O
her O
raise O
her O
head O
suddenly O
| | O
and O
the O
movement O
caused O
such O
agony O
, O
that O
, O
spite O
of O
all O
her O
efforts O
, O
she O
could O
not O
prevent O
an O
almost O
convulsive O
cry O
of O
pain O
. O
" O
My O
dear O
child O
! O
I O
had O
no O
idea O
of O
pain O
like O
this O
| | O
why O
did O
you O
not O
send O
for O
me O
? O
We O
have O
always O
prevented O
its O
becoming O
so O
very O
violent O
by O
taking O
it O
in O
time O
, O
my O
Ellen S-PERSON
. O
" O
" O
Miss O
Ellen S-PERSON
would O
not O
let O
me O
go O
for O
you O
, O
madam O
, O
" O
rejoined O
Ellis S-PERSON
, O
who O
, O
to O
her O
mistress's O
inexpressible O
relief O
, O
was O
close O
at O
hand O
with O
the O
remedies O
she O
wanted O
, O
and O
she O
repeated O
what O
the O
child O
had O
said O
. O
" O
Again O
your O
old O
mistake O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
. O
I O
would O
so O
much O
, O
so O
very O
much O
rather O
hear O
you O
say O
you O
were O
resolved O
to O
deserve O
my O
love O
, O
than O
that O
you O
did O
not O
merit O
it O
. O
Why O
should O
you O
not O
deserve O
it O
as O
well O
as O
your O
brother O
and O
cousins O
, O
if O
you O
determined O
with O
all O
your O
heart O
to O
try O
and O
not O
do O
any O
thing O
to O
lessen O
it O
? O
Nothing O
is O
so O
likely O
to O
prevent O
your O
even O
endeavoring O
to O
deserve O
it O
, O
as O
the O
mistaken O
fancy O
that O
you O
never O
shall O
| | O
but O
you O
are O
too O
unwell O
to O
listen O
to O
me O
now O
| | O
we O
must O
try O
all O
we O
can O
to O
remove O
this O
terrible O
pain O
, O
and O
then O
see O
if O
we O
can O
bring O
back O
happiness O
too O
. O
" O
And O
for O
above B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour E-TIME
did O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
with O
the O
most O
patient O
tenderness O
, O
apply O
the O
usual O
remedies O
, O
cheered O
by O
finding O
that O
, O
though O
much O
more O
slowly O
than O
usual O
, O
still O
by O
degrees O
the O
violence O
of O
the O
pain O
did O
subside O
, O
and O
the O
hysterical O
affection O
give O
way O
to O
natural O
and O
quiet O
tears O
. O
Exhaustion O
produced O
a O
deep O
though O
not O
very O
long O
sleep O
, O
and O
after O
watching O
her O
some B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes E-TIME
very O
anxiously O
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
sat O
down O
by O
her O
bed O
, O
and O
half O
unconsciously O
drew O
toward O
her O
Ellen's O
little O
Bible S-WORK_OF_ART
, O
which O
lay O
open O
on O
the O
table O
, O
as O
if O
it O
had O
been O
only O
lately O
used O
. O
Several O
loose O
papers O
were O
between O
the O
leaves O
| | O
her O
eyes O
filled O
with O
tears O
as O
she O
read O
on O
one O
of O
them O
a O
little O
prayer O
, O
touching O
from O
the O
very O
childishness O
of O
the O
language O
and O
imperfect O
writing O
, O
beseeching O
her O
Father O
in O
Heaven O
in O
His O
great O
mercy O
to O
forgive O
her O
sin O
, O
and O
give O
her O
courage O
to O
speak O
the O
truth O
, O
to O
help O
her O
not O
to O
be O
so O
frightened O
, O
but O
to O
guide O
her O
in O
her O
difficult O
path O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
little O
guessed O
how O
difficult O
it O
was O
, O
but O
she O
hoped O
more O
from O
the O
effects O
of O
her O
present O
penitence O
than O
she O
had O
done O
yet O
. O
She O
had O
copied O
, O
too O
, O
several O
verses O
from O
the O
various O
parts O
of O
the O
Old O
and O
New O
Testament O
which O
were O
condemnatory O
of O
falsehood O
, O
and O
her O
aunt O
felt O
no O
longer O
undecided O
as O
to O
her O
course O
of O
action O
. O
" O
You O
have O
employed O
your O
solitary O
hours O
so O
well O
, O
my O
dear O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
" O
she O
said O
, O
as O
, O
when O
the O
child O
awoke O
and O
looked O
anxiously O
toward O
her O
— O
she O
kissed O
her O
cheek O
with O
even O
more O
than O
her O
usual O
fondness O
— O
" O
that O
I O
scarcely O
require O
your O
assurance O
of O
repentance O
or O
promises O
of O
amendment O
. O
When O
you O
have O
taken O
some O
coffee O
, O
and O
think O
you O
are O
well O
enough O
to O
listen O
to O
me O
, O
I O
will O
read O
you O
an O
illustration O
of O
the O
fearful O
sin O
of O
falsehood O
from O
the B-WORK_OF_ART
Old I-WORK_OF_ART
Testament E-WORK_OF_ART
, O
which O
I O
do O
not O
think O
I O
have O
yet O
pointed O
out O
to O
you O
. O
Ananias S-PERSON
and O
Sapphira S-PERSON
, O
I O
see O
you O
remember O
. O
" O
And O
when O
Ellen S-PERSON
had O
taken O
the O
delicious O
cup O
of O
coffee O
, O
which O
her O
aunt O
had O
ordered O
should O
be O
ready O
for O
her O
directly O
she O
awoke O
, O
and O
sat O
up O
, O
though O
her O
head O
was O
still O
so O
weak O
it O
required O
the O
support O
of O
a O
pillow O
, O
yet O
she O
seemed O
so O
revived O
, O
so O
almost O
happy O
, O
from O
the O
mesmeric O
effect O
of O
that O
warm O
, O
fond O
kiss O
, O
that O
her O
aunt O
did O
not O
hesitate O
to O
continue O
the O
lesson O
she O
was O
so O
anxious O
to O
impress O
, O
while O
the O
mind O
and O
heart O
were O
softened O
to O
receive O
it O
. O
She O
turned O
to O
the O
fourth S-ORDINAL
chapter O
of O
the O
second S-ORDINAL
book O
of O
Kings S-WORK_OF_ART
, O
and O
after O
briefly O
relating O
the O
story O
of O
Naaman S-PERSON
— O
for O
she O
did O
not O
wish O
to O
divert O
Ellen's S-PERSON
attention O
from O
the O
one S-CARDINAL
important O
subject O
, O
by O
giving O
any O
new O
ideas O
— O
she O
read O
from O
the O
20th S-ORDINAL
verse O
to O
the O
end O
, O
and O
so O
brought O
the O
nature O
of O
Gehazi's S-PERSON
sin O
and O
its O
awful O
punishment O
, O
at O
the O
hand O
of O
God O
himself O
( O
for O
the O
prophet O
was O
merely O
an O
instrument O
of O
the O
Eternal O
, O
he O
had O
no O
power O
in O
himself O
to O
call O
the O
disease O
of O
leprosy O
on O
his O
servant O
) O
to O
Ellen's S-PERSON
mind O
, O
that O
she O
never O
forgot O
it O
. O
" O
Do O
you O
think O
Elisha S-PERSON
knew O
where O
he O
had O
been O
, O
and O
what O
he O
had O
done O
, O
before O
he O
asked O
him O
? O
" O
she O
ventured O
timidly O
to O
inquire O
, O
as O
her O
aunt O
ceased O
| | O
" O
Gehazi S-PERSON
had O
told O
a O
falsehood O
already O
to O
Naaman S-PERSON
. O
Do O
you O
think O
God O
punished O
that O
or O
his O
falsehood O
to O
Elisha S-PERSON
? O
" O
" O
Most O
probably O
he O
punished O
both O
, O
my O
love O
. O
Elisha S-PERSON
no O
doubt O
knew O
how O
his O
servant O
had O
been O
employed O
in O
his O
absence O
, O
in O
fact O
he O
tells O
him O
so O
" O
— O
and O
she O
read O
the O
26th S-ORDINAL
verse O
again O
— O
" O
but O
he O
asked O
him O
whence O
he O
had O
come O
, O
to O
give O
him O
an O
opportunity O
for O
a O
full O
confession O
of O
his O
first S-ORDINAL
sin O
, O
which O
then O
, O
no O
doubt O
would O
, O
after O
some O
slight O
rebuke O
, O
have O
been O
pardoned O
. O
It O
was O
a O
very O
great O
fault O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
, O
but O
the O
mercy O
of O
God O
was O
then O
, O
as O
it O
is O
now O
, O
so O
infinite O
so O
forgiving O
, O
that O
, O
had O
Elisha's S-PERSON
question O
recalled O
Gehazi S-PERSON
to O
a O
sense O
of O
his O
great O
guilt O
and O
excited O
real O
repentance O
, O
his O
punishment O
would O
have O
been O
averted O
. O
But O
his O
aggravated O
and O
repeated O
falsehood O
called O
down O
on O
him O
a O
chastisement O
most O
terrible O
even O
to O
think O
about O
. O
Leprosy O
was O
not O
merely O
a O
dreadful O
disease O
in O
itself O
, O
but O
it O
cut O
him O
off O
, O
from O
all O
the O
blessings O
and O
joys O
not O
only O
of O
social O
life O
but O
of O
domestic O
| | O
because O
, O
as O
God O
had O
said O
it O
should O
cleave O
to O
his O
seed O
as O
well O
as O
to O
himself O
, O
he O
could O
never O
find O
any O
one O
who O
would O
dare O
to O
love O
him O
, O
and O
he O
must O
have O
been O
compelled O
to O
lonely O
misery O
all O
his O
life O
. O
" O
" O
It O
was O
a O
very O
dreadful O
punishment O
, O
" O
repeated O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
fearfully O
. O
" O
It O
was O
, O
dearest O

but O
it O
was O
merciful O
, O
notwithstanding O
. O
If O
, O
God O
had O
passed O
it O
by O
, O
and O
permitted O
Gehazi S-PERSON
to O
continue O
his O
sinful O
course O
, O
without O
any O
check O
or O
chastisement O
that O
would O
recall O
him O
to O
a O
sense O
of O
better O
things O
, O
and O
a O
wish O
to O
pursue O
them O
, O
he O
might O
have O
continued O
apparently O
very O
happy O
in O
this O
life O
, O
to O
be O
miserable O
forever O
in O
the O
next O
| | O
to O
be O
banished O
forever O
from O
God O
and O
His O
good O
angels O

and O
would O
not O
that O
have O
been O
still O
more O
dreadful O
than O
the O
heaviest O
suffering O
here O
? O
In O
those O
times O
God O
manifested O
his O
judgments O
through O
His O
prophets O
directly O
. O
That O
is O
not O
the O
case O
now O
, O
but O
He O
has O
given O
us O
His O
word O
to O
tell O
us O
, O
by O
history O
as O
well O
as O
precept O
, O
those O
things O
that O
are O
pleasing O
to O
Him O
, O
and O
those O
which O
excite O
His O
anger O
| | O
and O
which O
, O
if O
not O
corrected O
while O
we O
are O
in O
this O
world O
, O
will O
cause O
our O
condemnation O
when O
our O
souls O
appear O
before O
Him O
in O
judgment O
, O
and O
when O
we O
can O
not O
correct O
them O
if O
we O
would O
. O
Now O
children O
, O
and O
even O
young O
people O
, O
can O
not O
know O
those O
things O
as O
well O
as O
their O
parents O
and O
guardians O
can O
, O
and O
if O
we O
neglect O
to O
teach O
them O
right O
and O
wrong O
, O
God O
is O
more O
angry O
with O
us O
than O
with O
them O
, O
as O
He O
tells O
Ezekiel S-PERSON
. O
" O
She O
read O
from O
the B-DATE
18th E-DATE
to O
the O
22d S-ORDINAL
verse O
of O
the O
third S-ORDINAL
chapter O
, O
and O
explained O
it O
, O
so O
that O
Ellen S-PERSON
could O
clearly O
understand O
it O
, O
and O
then O
said O
. O
" O

now O
, O
my O
dear O

can O
you O
quite O

Ellen's S-PERSON

were O
round O
her O
neck O
in O
a O
moment O

her O
head O
cradled O
on O
her O
bosom O

as O
her O
sole O
reply O

for O

felt O
she O
could O
not O
speak O
at O
first S-ORDINAL

without O
crying O
again O

she O
said O

a O
short O
pause O

very O
sadly O
. O
" O

turning O
to O
the B-DATE
129th E-DATE

read O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
twelve O
and O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
last O
verses O
carefully O
with O
her O

adding O
— O

very O
earnestly O

you O
to O
join O
us O
? O
" O
asked O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
anxiously O
, O
for O
the O
sudden O
joy O
that O
gleamed O
in O
Ellen's S-PERSON
eyes O
at O
the O
idea O
of O
joining O
the O
family O
, O
told O
what O
the O
disappointment O
would O
be O
if O
she O
could O
not O
. O
" O
It O
does O
not O
hurt O
me O
at O
all O
if O
I O
can O
rest O
it O
, O
aunt O
| | O
but O
I O
am O
afraid O
it O
will O
not O
let O
me O
walk O
, O
" O
she O
added O
, O
sorrowfully O
, O
as O
the O
attempt O
to O
walk O
caused O
it O
to O
throb O
again O
. O
" O
Never O
mind O
, O
Nelly S-PERSON
, O
even O
if O
you O
can O
not O
walk O
| | O
you O
shall O
make O
use O
of O
my O
pedestrian O
powers O
, O
" O
replied O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
joyously O
| | O
" O
rest O
your O
head O
on O
my O
shoulder O
— O
that's O
it O
— O
I O
should O
make O
a O
capital O
nurse O
I O
declare O

should O
I O
not O
, O
mamma O
? O
" O
And O
gayly O
answering O
in O
the O
affirmative O
, O
his O
mother O
could O
scarcely O
prevent O
a O
throb O
of O
pride O
, O
as O
she O
looked O
on O
his O
fine O
manly O
face O
, O
beaming O
with O
benevolent O
kindness O
on O
his O
little O
cousin O
, O
whom O
he O
had O
tenderly O
lifted O
in O
his O
arms O
, O
and O
checked O
his O
boisterous O
mirth O
and O
rapid O
stride O
to O
accommodate O
her O
. O
" O
You O
are O
not O
quite O
so O
light O
as O
Tiny O
, O
but O
she O
is O
all O
air O

I O
expect O
she O
will O
evaporate O
some O
day O
: O
never O
mind O
your O
hair O
, O
it O
does O
very O
well O

" O
" O
Stop O
, O
I O
will O
smooth O
it O
in O
a O
moment O
, O
" O
exclaimed O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
eagerly O
| | O
" O
it O
is O
Sunday S-DATE
, O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
she O
shall O
look O
well O

" O
" O
You O
had O
better O
let O
me O
do O
it O
, O
Emmy S-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
her O
mother O
, O
smiling O

" O
your O
cousin's O
head O
can O
only O
bear O
very O
tender O

The O

, O
the O
joyous O
voices O

even O
her O
uncle's O
kind O
greeting O

almost O
overpowered O
poor O
Ellen S-PERSON

as O
Percy S-PERSON

still O
preserving O
his O
character O
of O
an O

her O
carefully O
on O

Mrs. O

several O

the O
eventful O
night O
itself O

formed O
so O
large O

as O
little O
tokens O
of O
affection O
between O
the O

were O
also O
exchanged O

that O
the O

quite O
loaded O

many O
a O
time O
had O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
discovered O
some O
trait O
of O
character O

some O
ruling O
fancy O
, O
even O
in O
such O
a O
simple O
thing O
as O
the O
manufacture O
and O
presentation O
of O
home O
gifts O
. O
Their O
own O
idea O
of O
family O
ties O
was O
so O
strong O
and O
so O
holy O
, O
that O
one S-CARDINAL
great O
aim O
in O
the O
education O
of O
their O
children O
was O
to O
make O
them O
not O
only O
love O
each O
other O
, O

have O
thought O

attention O
for O
individual O
feelings O

so O
heighten O

action O

not O
depend O
entirely O
on O
natural O
ties O

Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
had O
known O
many O
young O
persons O
who O
were O
lavish O
in O
attentions O
and O
even O
presents O
to O
friends O
, O
but O
never O
imagined O
that O
their O
own O
home O
circle O
had O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
and O
strongest O
claim O
to O
kindness O
, O
whether O
of O
word O
or O
deed O

She O
knew O
that O
affections O
and O
thought O
lavished O
on O
comparative O
strangers O
never O
radiated O
on O
home O
, O
but O
that O
when O
given O
to O
home O
first S-ORDINAL
, O
they O
shed O
light O
and O
kindliness O
far O
and O
near O
. O
Their O
tea O
was O
indeed O
a O
mirthful O
one O

Ellen S-PERSON
had O
been O
very O
fearful O
of O
meeting O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON

she O
thought O
he O
must O
have O
been O
told O
how O
naughty O
she O
had O
been O

but O
if O
he O
had O
, O
there O
was O
nothing O
in O
his O
manner O
to O
say O
so O

for O
he O
shook O
hands O
with O
her O
, O
and O
even O
kissed O
her O
most O
kindly O
, O
and O
told O
her O
, O
laughingly O
, O
that O
she O
must O
be O
quite O
well O
by O
the O
next O
night O
, O
or O
how O
was O
she O
to O
dance O
? O
That O
he O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
a O
good O
thing O
if O
Emmeline S-PERSON
could O
give O
her O
a O
little O
of O
her O
dancing O
mania O

she O
hardly O
ever O

sober O

in O
the O
wildest O
spirits O

Percy S-PERSON

Emmeline S-PERSON
seemed O
to O
have O
laid O
a O
wager O
who O
could O
say O
the O
wittiest O
things O

laugh O
the O
most O

Herbert S-PERSON
was O
very O
quiet O

looking O
as O
happy O
as O
the O
rest O

quite O
entering O
into O
their O
mirth O

and O
showing O
all O
sorts O
of O
little O
gentle O
attentions O
to O
Ellen S-PERSON

who O
had O
seemed O
to O
shrink O
from O
his O
eye O
, O
more O
than O
from O
all O
the O
others O

Caroline S-PERSON
fully O
entered O
into O
the O
spirit O
of O
the O
evening O
, O

neither O
she O
nor O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
took O
the O

notice O

the O
rest O

always O
chosen O

great O
was O
the O
delight O
of O
the O
young O
party O

when O
this O
night O
the O
office O
fell O
on O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
. O
No O
one O
seemed O
more O
pleased O
than O
himself O
, O
performing O
it O
with O
such O
a O
spirit O
of O
enjoyment O

originality O

that O
a O
general O
vote O
declared O
him O
the O
very O
choicest O
wizard O

had O
ever O
had O

To O
enumerate O
all O
the O
contents O

marvelous O
tree O

be O
impossible O

Their O
parents' O
gifts O
to O
each O

them O
were O
not O
in O
the O
tree O

but O
always O
given O
afterward O

but O
great O
was O
the O
delight O
, O
when O
, O
after O
a O
terrible O
tussle O
to O
detach O
a O
large O
roll O
of O
cloth O
, O
down O
it O
came O
, O
right O
on O
Mr. O
Howard's S-PERSON
head O
, O
and O
almost O
enveloped O
him O
with O
its O
folds O
, O
and O
proved O
to O
be O
a O
beautiful O
cover O
, O
which O
he O
had O
long O
desired O
for O
a O
favorite O
table O
in O
his O
drawing O

room O
at O
the O
embroidered O

the O
three S-CARDINAL

all O

a O
joint O
offering O
of O
love O

This O
good O
man O
was O
so O
charmed O

declared O

not O

he O
had O
full O
five B-TIME

Then O
there O
was O
a O
very O
pretty O
, O
comfortable O
pair O
of O
slippers O
, O
worked O
by O
Caroline S-PERSON

for O
their O
father O
, O
and O
a O
pair O
of O
braces O
worked O
by O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
all O
accompanied O
by O
some O
most O
ludicrous O
, O
but O
very O
clever O
verses O
from O
Percy S-PERSON
. O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
very O
ingenious O
, O
had O
turned O
a O
very O
pretty O
stand O
for O
his O
uncle O
to O
put O
his O
watch O
in O
at O
night O

and O
manufactured O
two S-CARDINAL
little O
vessels O
out O
of O
cork O
for O
his O
aunt O
, O
so O
delicately O
, O
and O
neatly O
, O
that O
she O
promised O
him O
they O
should O
stand O
on O
the O
mantelpiece O
of O
her O
dressing O
- O
room O
, O
as O
long O
as O
they O
would O
last O
. O
Caroline S-PERSON
had O
knitted O
her O
mother O
a O
very O
pretty O
bag O
, O
and O
Emmeline S-PERSON
and O
Ellen S-PERSON
had O
collected O
for O
her O
a O
variety O
of O
leaves O
throughout O
the O
year O
, O
and O
arranged O
them O
with O
great O
taste O
, O
both O
as O
to O
grouping O
and O
tinting O
, O
in O
a O
sort O
of O
small O
herbal O
, O
with O
two S-CARDINAL
or O
three S-CARDINAL
lines O
of O
poetry O
, O
selected O
and O
carefully O
written O
by O
each O
alternately O
, O
attached O
to O
each O
page O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
was O
excessively O
pleased O
, O
as O
she O
was O
also O
with O
a O
portfolio O
formed O
by O
drawings O
from O
both O
her O
boys O
, O
and O
tastefully O
made O
up O
by O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON

with O
their O
gifts O
to O
their O
father O
, O
a O
correct O
and O
most O
beautifully O
written O
out O
Greek S-NORP
poem O
, O
which O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
had O
several B-DATE
months E-DATE
, O
if O
not O
more B-DATE
than I-DATE
a I-DATE
year I-DATE
before E-DATE
, O
expressed O
a O
wish O
to O
possess O
, O
but O
the O
volume O
which O
contained O
it O
was O
so O
scarce O
, O
and O
so O
expensive O
from O
the O
quantity O
of O
uninteresting O
matter O
in O
which O
the O
gem O
was O
buried O
, O
that O
he O
had O
given O
up O
all O
thought O
of O
it O
. O
Herbert S-PERSON
, O
however O
, O
had O
not O
, O
and O
never O
rested O
from O
the O
time O
his O
father O
spoke O
, O
till O
he O
had O
found O
and O
copied O
it O
— O
a O
task O
of O
no O
small O
difficulty O
, O
for O
the O
original O
was O
in O
many O
parts O
almost O
entirely O
effaced O
, O
and O
, O
if O
Herbert S-PERSON
had O
not O
been O
an O
admirable O
Greek S-NORP
scholar O
, O
and O
a O
quick O
imaginator O
as O
to O
what O
it O
ought O
to O
be O
, O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
himself O
had O
said O
he O
could O
not O
have O
succeeded O
. O
The O
writing O
of O
the O
Greek S-NORP
character O
was O
most O
beautiful O
, O
and O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
in O
imitation O
of O
the O
ancient O
missals O
, O
had O
designed O
and O
painted O
an O
elegant O
illuminated O
border O
round O
it O
, O
and O
a O
beautiful O
cover O
, O
forming O
a O
thin O
volume O
, O
so O
valuable O
, O
their O
father O
delighted O
them O
by O
saying O
, O
that O
he O
would O
not O
exchange O
it O
for O
twenty S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
most O
precious O
volumes O
in O
his O
library O
. O
Such O
evidences O
of O
the O
home O
influence O
they O
had O
given O
, O
in O
permitting O
leisure O
for O
the O
cultivation O
of O
taste O

imagination O
, O
teaching O

the O

and O
opening O
innumerable O
resources O
of O
enjoyment O
within O
themselves O
, O
and O
thence O
allowing O
them O
to O
enhance O
the O
pleasures O
of O
others O
, O
were O
indeed O
most O
gratifying O
to O
those O
earnest O
and O
affectionate O
guardians O
. O
From O
their B-DATE
earliest I-DATE
years E-DATE
they O
had O
been O
taught O
, O
that O

give O
the O
greatest O
amount O

pleasure O
to O
their O
parents O

to O

in O
the O

with O
Emmeline S-PERSON

Ellen's S-PERSON
tasteful O
gift O

Our O

call O

of O
New O
Year's O
gifts O
Mr. O

Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
had O
in O

for O

children O
( O
for O
Miss O

too O

for O

never O

her O
) O
, O
we O
really O
must O
not O
linger O
round O
it O
any O
longer O
. O
Poor O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
indeed O
, O
had O
the O
pain O
of O
feeling O
that O
her O
fault O
and O
its O
consequences O
had O
prevented O
the O
completion O
of O
her O
purse O
for O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
and O
a O
chain O
for O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
and O
her O
cheek O
burned O
very O
painfully O
, O
when O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
, O
after O
exhausting O
the O
tree O
, O
exclaimed O
— O
" O
Nothing O
from O
Ellen S-PERSON

Percy S-PERSON

Young O

out O

it O

" O
" O
We O
shall O
receive O
them O
next B-DATE

potent O
conjuror O
, O
as O
you O
ought O
to O
have O
known O
without O
inquiring O
, O
" O
answered O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
directly O

and O
bending O
over O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
by O
whom O
he O
chanced O
to O
be O
standing O
, O
he O
said O
, O
kindly O
, O
" O
Never O
mind O
, O
Nelly S-PERSON

you O
will O
have O

in O
your O

of O
your O
cousin's O
feelings O

said O
his O
mother O
, O
in O
the O

low O
tone O
, O
as O
only O
to O
be O
heard O
by O
him O
and O
Ellen S-PERSON
. O
( O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
was O
very O
quick O
- O
sighted O
, O

he O
took O
Percy's S-PERSON
jest O

turned O
off O
all O
farther O
notice O
of O
his O
words O

" O
Even O
such O
a O
little O
thing O
as O
this O
in O
Ellen's S-PERSON
case O
is O
pain O
, O

can O
only O
be O
felt O
as O
such O

do O
not O

it O
by O
denying O
it O

my O
Ellen S-PERSON

we O

" O
" O
I O
would O
rather O
feel O
it O
, O
if O
it O
would O
help O
me O
to O
remember O

" O
was O
Ellen's S-PERSON
earnest O
and O
humble O
reply O

adding O
, O
" O
but O
I O
thank O
you O
, O
dear O
Percy S-PERSON
— O
you O
are O
so O
kind O

" O
" O
Not O
a O

" O
was O
his O
laughing O
answer O
. O
" O
Why O
, O
what O
in O
the O
world O
is O
this O
? O
" O
he O
added O

" O
I O
thought O
the O
tree O

exhausted O

" O

it O

this O
was O
hid O
at O
its O
root O

replied O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
, O
" O
and O
though O
it O
is O
directed O
to O
Caroline S-PERSON

it O
is O
somewhat O
too O
heavy O
for O
my O
wand O

must O
reach O
her O
in O
a O
more O
natural O
way O

" O
" O
Why O
, O
it O
is O
my O
flower O

my O
own O
beautiful O
flower O

one O
exactly O
like O
it O

at O

, O
" O
exclaimed O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
joyfully O
, O
as O
, O
removing O
a O
hollow O
pyramid O
of O
green O
and O
white O
paper O
, O
a O
myrtle O
was O
discovered O
of O
the O
same O
rare O
kind O
, O
and O
almost O
in O
as O
beautiful O
flower O
as O
the O
one O
whose O
death O
had O
caused O
such O
increased O
coldness O
in O
her O
feelings O
toward O

did O
it O
come O

procured O
it O
for O

" O
Ellis S-PERSON
sent O
for O
it O
at O
my O
request O
, O
dear O
Caroline S-PERSON

" O
answered O
Ellen S-PERSON
. O
" O
She O
said O
they O
were O
to O
be O
purchased O
from O
the O
gardener O
at O
Powderham S-GPE

if O
it O
were O
possible O

would O
endeavor O

one O

told O
me O
yesterday O

thought O
she O
gave O
it O
you O

I O
begged O
her O
, O
directly O

I O
had O
no O
opportunity O
to O
tell O
you O
before O

I O
was O
so O
very O
, O
very O
sorry O
I O
had O
hurt O
your O
flower O
. O
" O
" O
Ellis S-PERSON
was O
very O
wise O
to O
put O
it O
among O
the O
pretty O
things O
of O
this O
evening O
, O
instead O
of O
obeying O
you O

" O
said O
her O
uncle O
, O
kindly O

" O
and O
I O
really O
am O
glad O
that O
your O
great O
desire O
to O
replace O
it O
made O
her O
think O
of O
sending O
for O
it O

for O
though O
I O
meant O
to O
have O
given O
Caroline S-PERSON

I O
had O
so O
many O
things O
on O
my O
mind O
this B-DATE
week E-DATE

it O
escaped O
me O

much O
sought O
for O

" O
" O
Indeed O
, O
papa O

you O
were O
much O
too O
kind O
to O
think O
about O
it O
at O
all O

" O
said O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
very O
earnestly O
. O
" O
I O
am O
afraid O

if O
you O
knew O
how O
very O
cross O
and O
unkind O
the O
loss O
of O

I O
am O
very O
much O
obliged O
to O
you O

Ellen S-PERSON

she O
continued O
much O
more O
cordially O
than O
she O
had O
yet O
spoken O
to O
her O
cousin O

" O
I O
did O
not O

from O
you O

worked O
myself O
into O
such O
an O
ill O

as O
almost O
to O
believe O
you O

it O
purposely O

I O
had O
no O

out O

increased O

in O

recognized O
something O

always O
united O

tokens O

its O
letter O

press O
, O
which O
to O
Herbert S-PERSON
was O
beyond O

Edward S-PERSON
was O
almost O
wild O

as O

uncle O

gold O

as O
a O
parting O
gift O
to O
Captain O
Cameron S-PERSON

) O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
declared O
that O
it O
was O
much O
too O
good O
for O
a O
sailor O
, O
and O
would O
be O
lost O
his O
first S-ORDINAL
voyage O

he O
had O
much O
better O
hand O
it O
over O
to O
the O
Rectory S-FAC
, O
promising O
to O
take O
every O
care O
of O
it O

but O
looking O
so O
mischievous O
, O
Edward S-PERSON
vowed O
it O
should O
not O
get O
near O
his O
hand O

For O
Caroline S-PERSON
was O
a O
most O
complete O
and O
elegantly O
fitted O

up O
embroidery O
- O
box O
, O
which O
quite O
charmed O
her O
, O
for O
it O
was O
exactly O
like O
, O
if O
not O
more O
tasteful O
and O
complete O
, O
than O
one O
Annie B-PERSON
Grahame E-PERSON
had O
brought O
from O
London S-GPE
, O
and O
which O
she O
had O
wondered O
, O
Caroline S-PERSON
could O
" O
exist O
" O
without O
. O
As O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
found O
that O
she O
could O
not O
only O
comfortably O
" O
exist O
, O
" O
but O
much O
as O
she O
admired O
and O
had O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
so O
coveted O
it O
, O
as O
to O
have O
a O
hard O
battle O
with O
discontent O
, O
she O
had O
never O
even O
hinted O
that O
it O
might O
be O
useful O
. O
As O
they O
perceived O
that O
her O
mind O
was O
so O
happily O
engrossed O
by O
the O
idea O
of O
the O
pleasure O
her O
gifts O
would O
bestow O
, O
as O
not O
to O
cast O
a O
thought O
upon O
Annie's S-PERSON
superior O
box O
, O
they O
indulged O
themselves O
and O
their O
child O
, O
and O
were O
more O
than O
repaid O
by O
the O
beaming O
look O
of O
delight O
with O
which O
it O
was O
received O
. O
For O
Emmeline S-PERSON
was O
a O
parcel O
almost O
as O
large O
as O
herself O
, O
Percy S-PERSON

as O
much O

not O
more O

that O
in O
giving O
you O

have O
preserved O
me O
an O
old O

he O
continued O
, O
laughing O
at O
his O
sister's O
almost O
scream O
of O
delight O
, O
as O
she O
undid O
the O
covering O
of O
a O
book O

found O
it O
to O

so O
reveled O
in O
them O

just O
fitted O

How O

found O
out O

used O
the O
old O

quietly O

us O

he O
dragged O
a O
table O

displayed O

delighted O

proud O
of O

away O

explained O
to O

some O

longer O
did O
the O

re-examine O

talk O

that O

such O

Mrs. O

cultivated O
it O
, O
in O
her O
boys O

well O

simply O
for O

could O

pursued O

it O
such O

mistaken O
notion O

imagine O

perfection O

it O
was O
better O

old O

young O

to O
the O

lavish O

the O
servants' O
hall O

every O
cottage O

called O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
landlord O
, O
had O
vied O
in O
happiness O
with O
his O
own O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
had O
visited O
Ellen S-PERSON
the O
last O
thing O
, O
to O
see O
that O
she O
was O
quite O
comfortable O
, O
and O
that O
there O
was O
no O
return O
of O
pain O

and O
she O
was O
almost O
startled O
, O
and O
certainly O
still O
more O
bewildered O
as O
to O
how O
such O
a O
depth O
of O
feeling O
could O
exist O
with O
such O
a O
real O
childish O
liability O
to O
error O
, O
and O
why O
it O
should O
be O
so O
carefully O
concealed O
, O
by O
the O
way O
in O
which O
Ellen S-PERSON
clung O
to O
her O
, O
as O
she O
bent O
over O
her O
to O
wish O
her O
good O
night O
, O
with O
the O
same O
unrestrained O
affection O
as O
her O
own O
Emmeline S-PERSON
did O
so O
often O
, O
with O
the O
only O
difference O
, O
that O
with O
the O
latter O
it O
seemed O
always O
to O
spring O
from O
the O
very O
exuberance O
of O
happiness O
, O
which O
could O
only O
be O
thus O
displayed O
. O
With O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
this O
night O
, O
it O
appeared O
like O
some O
deep O
, O
quiet O
feeling O
, O
almost O
of O
devotion O
, O
and O
as O
if O
— O
though O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
sober O
reason O
tried O
to O
persuade O
her O
imagination O
that O
it O
was O
too O
much O
meaning O
to O
attach O
to O
a O
mere O
embrace O
— O
she O
would O
thus O
tell O
her O
how O
intensely O
she O
felt O
, O
not O
only O
the O
indulgence O
of O
that O
evening O
, O
but O
the O
true O
kindness O
and O
watchful O
love O
which O
had O
caused O
the O
preceding O
sorrow O
. O
She O
might O
have O
thought O
, O
as O
no O
doubt O
many O
of O
our O
readers O
will O
, O
that O
Ellen S-PERSON
was O
much O
too O
young O
and O
too O
childish O
, O
to O
contrast O
her O
system O
of O
treatment O
with O
her O
poor O
mother's O
| | O
that O
she O
felt O
her O
soothing O
care O
in O
her O
hours O
of O
physical O
suffering O
— O
her O
indulgent O
love O
making O
no O
distinction O
between O
her O
and O
her O
cousins O
— O
still O
the O
more O
keenly O
and O
gratefully O
, O
from O
the O
recollection O
of O
her O
own O
mother's O
constant O
preference O
of O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
and O
utter O
neglect O
of O
her O
| | O
and O
that O
this O
contrast O
so O
deepened O
the O
love O
she O
bore O
her O
aunt O
, O
that O
it O
exceeded O
in O

even O
that O
borne O
toward O
her O
by O
her O
own O
children O

— O
Adults O
will O
think O
this O
all O
very O
fanciful O
, O
and O
perhaps O
interesting O
, O
but O
wholly O
improbable O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
herself O
would O
have O
banished O
the O
idea O
, O
as O
too O
imaginary O
to O
be O
entertained O
seriously O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
as O
any O
guide O
for O
her O
conduct O
. O
Ellen S-PERSON
herself O
could O
not O
have O
explained O
or O
told O
herself O
that O
so O
she O
felt O
| | O
and O
yet O
, O
notwithstanding O
, O
all O
we O
have O
written O
was O
there O
, O
and O
was O
the O
real O
prompter O
of O
that O
almost O
passionate O
embrace O
. O
" O
Bless O
you O
, O
my O
darling O
! O
" O
was O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
fond O
reply O
, O
instead O
of O
permitting O
the O
child O
to O
perceive O
the O
surprise O
it O
excited O
in O
herself O

and O
Ellen S-PERSON
sunk O
to O
sleep O
, O
almost O
more O
happy O
than O
ever O

in O
her O
little O
life O

she O
had O
felt O

XI O

THE O
CHILDREN'S O
BALL O
. O
If O
the O
thought O
of O
their O
promised O
ball O
were O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
that O
entered O
the O
minds O
of O
the O
young O
party O
at O
Oakwood S-GPE
, O
as O
they O
opened O
their O
eyes O
on O
New B-EVENT
Year's I-EVENT
day E-EVENT
, O
it O
was O
not O
very O
unnatural O
. O
Percy S-PERSON
gloried O
in O
the O
anticipation O
of O
being O
master O
of O
the O
ceremonies O
, O
and O
in O
conducting O
the O
whole O
affair O
with O
such O
inimitable O
grace O
and O
gallantry O
, O
that O
every O
one O
should O
declare O
it O
was O
far O
superior O
to O
any O
party O
, O
old O
or O
young O
, O
of O
the O
season O
, O
except O
Mr. O
Howard's S-PERSON
| | O
that O
was O
beyond O
him O
, O
he O
said O
, O
for O
he O
could O
not O
put O
Mr. O
Howard's S-PERSON
head O
on O
his O
shoulders O
. O
Herbert S-PERSON
anticipated O
the O
enjoyment O
of O
Mary B-PERSON
Greville's E-PERSON
society O
, O
talking O
to O
and O
dancing O
with O
her O
undisturbed O
, O
and O
to O
hearing O
the O
almost O
universal O
remark O
, O
what O
a O
sweet O
girl O
she O
was O
. O
Edward S-PERSON
did O
not O
exactly O
know O
what O
he O
expected O
, O
but O
he O
was O
in O
such O
a O
mood O
of O
hilarity O
and O
mischief O
, O
that O
the O
servants O
all O
declared O
Master B-WORK_OF_ART
Fortescue E-WORK_OF_ART
was O
" O
mazed O
. O
" O
To O
Caroline S-PERSON
their O
ball O
was O
almost O
always O
( O
though O
unconfessedly O
) O
the O
happiest O
evening O
in O
the O
year O
. O
She O
knew O
she O
was O
handsome O
— O
Annie B-PERSON
Grahame E-PERSON
had O
told O
her O
how O
very O
much O
she O
would O
be O
admired O
in O
London S-GPE
, O
and O
that O
if O
she O
were O
not O
her O
very O
dearest O
friend O
, O
she O
should O
envy O
her O
beauty O
terribly O
. O
She O
often O
in O
secret O
longed O
painfully O
for O
admiration O
and O
homage O
| | O
and O
child O
as O
she O
still O
was O
in O
years S-DATE
, O
yet O
at O
her O
own O
house O
, O
and O
as O
Mr. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
eldest O
daughter O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
her O
real O
attractions O
, O
she O
always O
received O
both O
in O
sufficient O
measure O
, O
as O
to O
satisfy O
even O
herself O
. O
She O
delighted O
in O
those O
evenings O
when O
it O
so O
chanced O
that O
her O
brothers O
had O
young O
friends O
with O
them O
, O
making O
no O
hesitation O
in O
confessing O
that O
she O
very O
much O
preferred O
conversing O
with O
boys O
than O
with O
girls O
, O
there O
was O
so O
much O
more O
variety O
, O
more O
spirit O
| | O
and O
though O
her O
mother's O
heart O
would O
actually O
tremble O
at O
the O
fearful O
ordeal O
which O
an O
introduction O
to O
the O
pleasures O
of O
the O
world O
would O
be O
to O
such O
a O
character O
, O
still O
she O
would O
not O
check O
the O
open O
expression O
of O
such O
sentiments O
by O
reproving O
them O
as O
wrong O
, O
and O
not O
to O
be O
encouraged O
. O
She O
knew O
that O
though O
education O
might O
do O
much O
, O
very O
much O
, O
it O
could O
not O
make O
natural O
characters O
all O
alike O
| | O
nor O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
did O
she O
wish O
it O
. O
She O
did O
not O
grieve O
and O
complain O
that O
, O
with O
all O
her O
efforts O
she O
could O
not O
make O
Caroline S-PERSON
give O
her O
as O
little O
trouble O
and O
anxiety O
as O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
nor O
did O
she O
imagine O
that O
she O
should O
see O
the O
effect O
of O
her O
earnest O
prayers O
and O
cares O
all O
at O
once O
, O
or O
without O
constant O
relapses O
in O
the O
cherished O
object O
of O
her O
care O
. O
She O
did O
all O
she O
could O
to O
counteract O
a O
tendency O
which O
, O
situated O
as O
she O
would O
be O
when O
she O
entered O
life O
, O
must O
, O
without O
some O
strong O
, O
high O
principle O
, O
lead O
to O
suffering O
, O
and O
, O
perhaps O
, O
to O
sin O
— O
for O
what O
is O
coquetry O
? O
But O
she O
indulged O
in O
no O
idea O
of O
security O
, O
never O
believed O
that O
because O
she O
had O
so O
tried O
, O
so O
striven O
to O
sow O
the O
good O
seed O
, O
it O
could O
not O
fail O
to O
bring O
forth O
good O
fruit O
. O
She O
knew O
many O
trials O
might O
be O
in O
store O
for O
her O
| | O
for O
how O
might O
she O
hope O
to O
pass O
through O
life O
blessed O
as O
she O
was O
then O
? O
It O
might O
please O
her O
Father O
in O
Heaven O
to O
try O
her O
faith O
and O
duty O
through O
those O
she O
loved O
so O
intensely O
| | O
but O
if O
she O
failed O
not O
in O
her O
task O
, O
he O
would O
bring O
her O
joy O
at O
last O
. O
To O
Emmeline S-PERSON
the O
idea O
of O
dancing O
was O
quite O
enough O
to O
be O
the O
acme O
of O
enjoyment O
. O
The O
only O
drawback O
was O
, O
that O
in O
the O
intervals O
of O
rest O
, O
there O
was O
to O
be O
a O
little O
music O
, O
and O
though O
her O
mother O
had O
excused O
her O
at O
Mr. O
Howard's S-PERSON
, O
she O
knew O
that O
if O
anybody O
expressed O
a O
wish O
to O
hear O
her O
at O
her O
own O
house O
, O
play O
she O
must O
| | O
and O
at O
those O
times O
she O
was O
half O
sorry O
she O
had O
chosen O
to O
learn O
the O
harp O
instead O
of O
the O
piano O
, O
as O
Caroline S-PERSON
played O
so O
well O
on O
the O
latter O
instrument O
nobody O
would O
care O
to O
hear O
her O
| | O
but O
the O
harp O
was O
rather O
a O
novelty O
, O
and O
no O
little O
girl O
who O
was O
coming O
played O
it O
, O
and O
so O
she O
was O
sadly O
afraid O
there O
was O
no O
escape O
for O
her O
, O
and O
that O
was O
very O
disagreeable O
, O
but O
she O
would O
not O
think O
about O
it O
till O
the O
time O
came O
| | O
the O
dancing O
to O
such O
music O
as O
that O
which O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
had O
ordered O
from O
Plymouth S-GPE
was O
joy O
enough O
. O
Ellen S-PERSON
though O
rather O
afraid O
of O
so O
many O
strangers O
, O
could O
not O
resist O
the O
general O
contagion O
of O
anticipated O
enjoyment O
. O
She O
did O
not O
indeed O
wake O
with O
the O
thought O
of O
the O
ball O
, O
but O
with O
the O
determination O
to O
learn O
the O
verse O
of O
the O
Psalm O
her O
aunt O
had O
pointed O
out O
, O
and O
go O
and O
say O
it O
to O
her O
in O
her O
dressing O
- O
room O
before O
she O
went O
down O
. O
And O
as O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
verse O
was O
very O
short O
she O
learned O
two S-CARDINAL
, O
and O
repeated O
them O
without O
missing O
a O
word O
, O
and O
so O
as O
if O
she O
quite O
understood O
them O
, O
that O
her O
aunt O
was O
very O
much O
pleased O
| | O
and O
then O
Ellen S-PERSON
could O
think O
of O
and O
join O
her O
brother's O
and O
cousins' O
delight O
, O
even O
though O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
was O
obliged O
to O
be O
what O
she O
called O
very O
cruel O
, O
but O
what O
Ellen S-PERSON
knew O
was O
very O
kind O
, O
though O
it O
did O
seem O
a O
restraint O
, O
and O
keep O
her O
very O
quiet O
all O
day O
, O
instead O
of O
letting O
her O
run O
about O
from O
room O
to O
room O
, O
as O
Emmeline S-PERSON
and O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
and O
even O
Percy S-PERSON
did O
, O
for O
fear O
of O
another O
headache O
| | O
and O
so O
well O
did O
quietness O
succeed O
, O
that O
she O
looked O
and O
was O
unusually O
well O
, O
and O
so O
was O
almost O
lively O
by O
the O
evening O
. O
Just O
before O
dinner O
, O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
gone O
to O
ride O
, O
because O
he O
said O
he O
was O
sure O
he O
should O
get O
into O
some O
scrape O
if O
he O
did O
not O
give O
a O
natural O
vent O
to O
his O
spirits O
, O
galloped O
back O
in O
company O
with O
a O
gentleman O
, O
whose O
presence O
seemed O
to O
occasion O
him O
still O
greater O
excitement O
. O
" O
Where O
is O
my O
mother O
? O
and O
is O
my O
father O
at O
home O
? O
" O
he O
asked O
impatiently O
, O
flinging O
his O
horse's O
rein O
to O
Robert S-PERSON
, O
desiring O
him O
to O
take O
every O
care O
of O
the O
gentleman's O
horse O
, O
as O
he O
should O
not O
let O
him O
leave O
Oakwood S-GPE
that O
night O
| | O
and O
rushing O
across O
the O
hall O
threw O
open O
the O
door O
of O
their O
common O
sitting O
- O
room O
, O
and O
exclaimed O
— O
" O
Mother O
, O
give O
me O
a O
vote O
of O
thanks O
and O
praise O
for O
my O
invincible O
eloquence O
! O
— O
Here O
is O
this O
anchorite O
, O
this O
monk O
of O
the O
moor O
, O
who O
, O
when O
I O
first S-ORDINAL
encountered O
him O
, O
seemed O
so O
doughty O
a O
denier O
of O
my O
wishes O
, O
actually O
conquered O
— O
led O
a O
slave O
to O
your O
feet O
| | O
reward O
me O
by O
throwing O
all O
the O
fascinations O
you O
possibly O
can O
in O
his O
way O
, O
that O
he O
may O
only O
dream O
of O
his O
cold O
ride O
and O
desolate O
cottage O
on O
Dartmoor S-GPE
to O
- O
night O
. O
" O
" O
Be O
quiet O
, O
madcap O
! O
" O
replied O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
rising O
with O
very O
evident O
pleasure O
, O
and O
coming O
forward O
with O
extended O
hand O
| | O
" O
your O
noisy O
welcome O
will O
not O
permit O
mine O
to O
be O
heard O

This O
is O
indeed O
, O
a O
pleasure O
, O
Mr. O
Morton S-PERSON
, O
" O
she O
added O
, O
addressing O
the O
young O
clergyman O
with O
that O
earnest O
kindness O
, O
which O
always O
goes O
to O
the O
heart O
, O
" O
and O
one O
that O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
will O
most O
highly O
appreciate O
— O
if O
, O
as O
I O
trust O
, O
the O
chains O
my O
son O
has O
thrown O
over O
you O

not O
so O
heavy O
as O
to O
become O
painful O
. O
" O
" O
I O
should O
rather O
fear O
the O
pain O
will O
be O
in O
casting O
them O
off O
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
not O
in O
the O
wearing O
them O
, O
" O
replied O
Mr. O
Morton S-PERSON
, O
almost O
sadly O
| | O
" O
it O
is O
the O
knowledge O
, O
that O
mingling O
as O
often O
in O
your O
home O
circle O
as O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON

my O
friend O
Percy S-PERSON
desire O
, O
would O
wholly O
unfit O
me O
for O
the O
endurance O
of O
my O
loneliness O
, O
that O
keeps O
me O
so O
aloof O
, O
believe O
me O

Inclination O
would O
act O
a O
very O
different O
part O
, O
but O
there O
was O
no O
resisting O
such O
eloquence O

such O
happiness O
as O
his O
to O
- O
day O
, O

he O
continued O
, O
more O
gayly O
. O
And O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
and O
Herbert S-PERSON
entering O
as O
he O
spoke O
, O
their O
greeting O
was O
quite O
as O
warm O

eager O
as O
Percy's S-PERSON
and O
his O
mother's O
, O
and O
Mr. O
Morton S-PERSON
gave O
himself O
up O
, O
for O
the O
evening O
at O
least O
, O
to O
enjoyment O
. O
His O
own O
generous O
nature O
had O
been O
particularly O
struck O
by O
Percy's S-PERSON
manly O
conduct O
with O
regard O
to O
his O
satire O
, O
and O
different O
as O
were O
their O
characters O
, O
a O
warm O
friendship O
from O
that O
moment O
commenced O
between O
them O
. O
It O
was O
impossible O
to O
resist O
Percy's S-PERSON
warm O
- O
heartedness O
of O
word O
and O
deed O
| | O
and O
that O
he O
would O
sometimes O
leave O
his O
luxurious O
home O
, O
and O
stay O
two B-DATE
or I-DATE
three I-DATE
days E-DATE
with O
Mr. O
Morton S-PERSON
, O
seeming O
actually O
to O
enjoy O
the O
rude O
cottage O
and O
its O
desolate O
localities O
, O
and O
spread O
such O
a O
spirit O
of O
mirth O
within O
and O
around O
, O
that O
it O
was O
no O
wonder O
the O
afflicted O
young O
man O
looked O
to O
his O
society O
as O
almost O
his O
greatest O
pleasure O
, O
especially O
as O
he O
felt O
he O
dared O
not O
too O
often O
accept O
Mr. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
continually O
- O
proffered O
invitation O
. O
Oakwood S-GPE
was O
the O
home O
which O
had O
been O
his O
beau O
idéal O
for O
long O
years O
, O
but O
which O
now O
seemed O
wholly O
unattainable O
. O
He O
felt O
himself O
doomed O
to O
solitude O
and O
suffering O
, O
and O
the O
struggle O
for O
content O
and O
cheerfulness O
was O
always O
more O
painful O
after O
he O
had O
been O
with O
his O
friends O
. O
When O
all O
preparations O
for O
the O
evening O
were O
concluded O
, O
even O
the O
respective O
toilets O
completed O
, O
Percy S-PERSON
and O
Emmeline S-PERSON
found O
it O
impossible O
to O
resist O
trying O
the O
spring O
, O
as O
they O
called O
it O
, O
of O
the O
oaken O
floors O
( O
whence O
the O
carpets O
had O
been O
removed O
) O
, O
and O
amused O
themselves O
by O
waltzing O
in O
the O
largest O
circle O
they O
could O
make O
. O
The O
beautiful O
suite O
of O
rooms O
were O
all O
thrown O
open O
, O
and O
perceiving O
Caroline S-PERSON
standing O
by O
the O
piano O
in O
an O
adjoining O
apartment O
, O
Percy S-PERSON
called O
out O
— O
" O
Play O
us O
a O
waltz O
, O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
there's O
a O
love O

the O
very O
liveliest O
you O
can O
find O
. O
Tiny O
and O
I O
want O
to O
try O
the O
boards O
while O
we O
can O
enjoy O
them O
to O
perfection O
, O
that O
is O
, O
when O
we O
are O
the O
only O
persons O
in O
the O
room O
. O
" O
" O
You O
must O
excuse O
me O
, O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
" O
she O
replied O
somewhat O
pettishly O
. O
" O
I O
should O
think O
you O
would O
have O
dancing O
enough O
in O
the O
course O
of O
the O
evening O
| | O
and O
what O
will O
our O
friends O
think O
, O
if O
they O
come O
and O
find O
me O
playing O
? O
" O
" O
Think O
? O
why O
, O
that O
you O
are O
very O
obliging O
, O
which O
at O
present O
you O
are O
not O
, O
" O
answered O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
laughing O
| | O
" O
never O
mind O
, O
Emmy O

let O
us O
try O
what O
our O
united O
lungs O
will O
do O
. O
" O
" O
You O
may O
if O
you O
like O
, O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
but O
really O
I O
am O
not O
clever O
enough O
to O
dance O
and O
sing O
at O
the O
same O
time O
— O
I O
should O
have O
no O
breath O
left O
, O
" O
was O
her O
as O
joyous O
rejoinder O
. O
" O
Come O
and O
dance O
, O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
if O
you O
will O
not O
play O

" O
exclaimed O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
who O
after O
decorating O
his O
button O
- O
hole O
with O
a O
sprig O
of O
holly O
, O
seemed O
seized O
with O
Percy's S-PERSON
dancing O
- O
mania O
. O
" O
Do O
give O
me O
an O
opportunity O
of O
practicing O
the O
graces O
before O
I O
am O
called O
upon O
to O
display O
them O

" O
" O
My O
love O
of O
dancing O
is O
not O
so O
great O
as O
to O
attempt O
it O
without O
music O
, O
so O
practice O
by O
yourself O
, O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
" O
was O
Caroline's S-PERSON
quick O
reply O
. O
" O
Without O
spectators O
, O
you O
mean O
, O
Lina S-PERSON
, O
" O
observed O
her O
brother O
, O
very O
dryly O
| | O
and O
as O
Emmeline S-PERSON
begged O
him O
not O
to O
tease O
her O
, O
he O
asked O
— O
" O
What O
has O
put O
her O
in O
this O
ill O
- O
humor O
, O
Emmy O
? O
" O
" O
Oh O
, O
I O
don't O
know O
exactly O

but O
if O
you O
let O
her O
alone O
, O
she O
will O
soon O
recover O
it O
. O
" O
" O
Well O
, O
to O
please O
you O
, O
I O
will O

for O
you O
look O
so O
pretty O
to O
- O
night O
, O
I O
can O
not O
resist O
you O
. O
" O
" O
Take O
care O
, O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
if O
you O
try O
to O
turn O
my O
head O
with O
such O
speeches O
, O
I O
shall O
go O
to O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
and O
punish O
you O
by O
not O
waltzing O
with O
you O
, O
" O
said O
his O
little O
sister O
, O
shaking O
her O
head O
at O
him O
with O
a O
comic O
species O
of O
reproach O
. O
" O
That's O
right O
, O
Emmy O
| | O
do O
not O
take O
flattery O
even O
from O
a O
brother O
, O
" O
said O
her O
father O
, O
coming O
forward O
with O
a O
smile O
| | O
" O
but O
will O
you O
not O
tire O
yourself O
by O
dancing O
already O
? O
" O
" O
Oh O
, O
no O
, O
papa O

I O
feel O
as O
if O
I O
could O
dance O
all O
night O
without O
stopping O
. O
" O
" O
Not O
with O
me O
, O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
" O
rejoined O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
shrugging O
his O
shoulders O
with O
horror O
at O
the O
idea O
| | O
" O
I O
should O
cry O
you O
mercy O
, O
before O
one S-CARDINAL
half O
the O
time O
had O
elapsed O
. O
" O
" O
But O
if O
you O
are O
not O
to O
be O
tired O
, O
will O
you O
not O
spoil O
your O
dress O
, O
and O
disorder O
all O
these O
flowing O
curls O
, O
" O
continued O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
" O
and O
surely O
that O
will O
be O
a O
great O
misfortune O
. O
" O
" O
Indeed O
it O
will O
not O
, O
papa O

Percy S-PERSON
has O
surely O
too O
much O
regard O
for O
me O
, O
to O
willfully O
hurt O
my O
frock O
, O
and O
if O
my O
hair O
should O
be O
so O
troublesome O
as O
to O
get O
out O
of O
order O
, O
Fanny S-PERSON
will O
re-arrange O
it O
in O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes E-TIME
. O
" O
" O
If O
you O
wish O
to O
cause O
alarm O
on O
that O
score O
, O
my O
dear O
father O
, O
" O
said O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
with O
marked O
emphasis O
, O
" O
You O
must O
go O
to O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
not O
to O
Emmeline S-PERSON
. O
Thank O
goodness O
, O
I O
have O
one S-CARDINAL
sister O
above O
such O
petty O
misfortunes O
. O
" O
" O
Are O
you O
not O
too O
hard O
upon O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
Percy S-PERSON
? O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
papa O
, O
he O
is O
indeed O
| | O
do O
not O
mind O
what O
he O
says O
, O
" O
answered O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
very O
eagerly O
| | O
but O
Percy S-PERSON
said O
impetuously O
— O
" O
I O
am O
not O
, O
Emmeline S-PERSON
. O
I O
would O
lay O
any O
wager O
that O
some O
thing O
has O
gone O
wrong O
with O
her O
dressing O
, O
to O
- O
night O
, O
and O
so O
made O
her O
pettish O
. O
Her O
frock O
is O
not O
smart O
enough O
, O
or O
she O
does O
not O
wear O
the O
ornaments O
she O
wished O
, O
or O
some O
such O
thing O
. O
" O
Caroline S-PERSON
had O
fortunately O
quitted O
the O
music O
- O
room O
, O
or O
this O
speech O
would O
not O
have O
tended O
to O
restore O
her O
serenity O
| | O
but O
before O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
could O
reply O
, O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
been O
to O
seek O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
burst O
into O
the O
room O
exclaiming O
— O
" O
Now O
, O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
we O
may O
have O
a O
proper O
waltz O
| | O
aunt O
Emmeline S-PERSON
says O
we O
may O
have O
just O
one O
before O
any O
one O
comes O
, O
and O
here O
she O
is O
to O
play O
for O
us O
, O
and O
Ellen S-PERSON
for O
my O
partner O
, O
" O
and O
they O
enjoyed O
it O
in O
earnest O
. O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
watched O
them O
for O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes E-TIME
, O
and O
then O
went O
to O
seek O
his O
elder O
girl O
. O
She O
was O
alone O
in O
a O
little O
room O
prepared O
for O
refreshments O
, O
tastefully O
arranging O
some O
beautiful O
flowers O
in O
a O
bouquet O
. O
She O
looked O
up O
as O
he O
entered O
, O
and O
so O
smiled O
that O
her O
fond O
father O
thought O
Percy S-PERSON
must O
be O
wrong O
, O
for O
there O
certainly O
seemed O
no O
trace O
of O
ill O
- O
temper O
. O
" O
Why O
are O
you O
not O
with O
your O
brothers O
and O
sister O
in O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
, O
my O
dear O
? O
and O
why O
did O
you O
just O
now O
refuse O
your O
brother O
such O
a O
trifling O
favor O
as O
playing O
a O
waltz O
? O
" O
he O
asked O
, O
but O
so O
kindly O
, O
that O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
though O
she O
blushed O
deeply O
, O
instantly O
replied O
— O
" O
Because O
, O
papa O
, O
my O
temper O
was O
not O
quite O
restored O

I O
went O
into O
the O
music O
- O
room O
to O
try O
mamma's O
remedy O
of O
solitude O
for O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes E-TIME
, O
but O
Percy S-PERSON
spoke O
to O
me O
before O
I O
had O
succeeded O
. O
I O
know O
I O
answered O
him O
pettishly O
, O
but O
indeed O
, O
papa O
, O
" O
she O
added O
, O
looking O
up O
earnestly O
in O
his O
face O
, O
" O
indeed O
he O
is O
very O
provoking O
sometimes O
. O
" O
" O
I O
know O
he O
is O
, O
my O
love O

he O
does O
not O
always O
know O
how O
to O
time O
his O
jokes O
, O
or O
to O
make O
sufficient O
allowance O
for O
dispositions O
not O
exactly O
like O
his O
own O
| | O
but O
tell O
me O
, O
what O
first S-ORDINAL
occasioned O
temper O
so O
to O
fail O
that O
solitude O
was O
necessary O
. O
" O
Caroline's S-PERSON
blush O
became O
still O
deeper O
, O
and O
she O
turned O
away O
her O
head O
saying O
, O
very O
hesitatingly O
— O
" O
For O
such O
a O
very O
, O
very O
silly O
reason O
, O
papa O
, O
that O
I O
do O
not O
like O
to O
tell O
you O
. O
" O
" O
Nay O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
do O
not O
fear O
that O
I O
shall O
either O
laugh O
at O
or O
reproach O
you O
. O
If O
you O
feel O
yourself O
how O
very O
silly O
it O
was O
, O
I O
am O
not O
afraid O
of O
its O
gaining O
too O
great O
ascendency O
, O
even O
if O
you O
fail O
again O
. O
" O
" O
It O
was O
only O
— O
only O
— O
that O
I O
was O
not O
quite O
satisfied O
with O
the O
dress O
mamma O
desired O
me O
to O
wear O
to O
- O
night O
, O
papa O

that O
was O
all O

indeed O
. O
" O
" O
You O
wished O
, O
perhaps O
, O
to O
wear O
a O
smarter O
one O
, O
my O
love O
, O
" O
replied O
her O
father O
, O
kissing O
her O
glowing O
cheek O
so O
affectionately O
, O
that O
the O
pain O
of O
her O
confession O
was O
instantly O
soothed O

" O

, O
indeed O
, O
I O
think O
mamma O
has O
shown O
a O
much O
better O
taste O

It O
requires O
more O
care O
than O
you O
are O
yet O
perhaps O
aware O
of O
to O
dress O
so O
exactly O
according O
to O
our O
age O

station O

as O
to O
do O
ourselves O
justice O

excite O
no O
unpleasant O
feelings O

no O

Many O
of O
our O

to O

could O
not O
afford O

ours O

both O
inhospitable O

Caroline's S-PERSON

more O

any O

the O

up O

pleased O

that O

the O

the O
manner O

inwardly O
feared O

look O
of O
disappointment O

self O
- O
reproach O

so O
irresistibly O
comic O

that O
Percy S-PERSON

Edward S-PERSON
burst O
into O
an O
immoderate O
fit O
of O
laughter O

the O

only O
checked O

congratulating O

his O
new O
accomplishment O

" O
The O
rapid O
succession O

very O
speedily O
the O
inspiring O
sound O
of O
the O
beautiful O

was O
stationed O

sort O
of O
ante-chamber O
between O

the O
younger O

After O
two S-CARDINAL
or O
three S-CARDINAL
quadrilles O
, O
the O
spirit O
of O
enjoyment O
seemed O
to O
reign O
alone O

not O
only O
among O

themselves O

even O
those O

out O

Percy S-PERSON

so O
active O

so O
universal O

their O
attention O

all O
had O
the O

no O
sitting O
down O
four S-CARDINAL

five S-CARDINAL

therefore O
neither O
weariness O

Where O
there O
is O
a O
great O

the O

seldom O
fail O

there O
was O
such O
a O
variety O
of O
amusements O
in O
the O
various O
rooms O
that O
were O
thrown O
open O
, O
suitable O
for O
all O
ages O

from O
the O
mammas O

the O
youngest O

it O
was O
scarcely O

pleasure O

Very O
many O
sets O
had O
been O
formed O

danced O
before O

Grahame S-PERSON

as O
Caroline S-PERSON
glanced O
at O
her O
friend O
and O
even O
at O
her O
little O
sister O
, O
it O
required O
a O
very O
vivid O
recollection O
of O
her O
father's O
words O
to O
prevent O
a O
feeling O
of O
false O
shame O

looked O
at O
Emmeline S-PERSON

even O
her O
favorite O
Caroline S-PERSON
for O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes E-TIME
with O
almost O
contempt O

she O
thought O

" O

she O
can O
have O
none O
in O
dress O

certain O

why O
no O
one O
could O
distinguish O
her O
daughters O

the O
poorest O
gentleman's O
here O

no O

be O
envied O

If O
looks O
were O
evidence O

envy O

Annie S-PERSON
had O
them O
to O
her O
heart's O
content O

how O
would O

have O

mortified O

read O
the O
secret O

the O
contrast O
drawn O
between O
the O
manners O

appearance O
of O
Lady O

daughters O

those O
of O
the O
Honorable O
Mrs. O

Lady O
Helen S-PERSON
herself O
, O
indeed O
, O
when O
she O
saw O
Caroline S-PERSON
and O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
was O
quite O
provoked O
that O
she O
had O
been O
so O
weak O
as O
to O
permit O
, O

even O
encourage O
Annie S-PERSON

select O
her O
own O

her O
sister's O
costume O

" O

so O
late O

came O
forward O

was O
almost O
bitter O

indeed O

my O
patience O

my O
little O
Lilla's S-PERSON
was O
so O
exhausted O
, O
that O
we O
thought O
of O
leaving O
Cecil S-PERSON

be O
their O
beau O

coming O
alone O
an B-TIME
hour I-TIME

" O
Lady O
Helen's S-PERSON
look O
of O
entreaty O
at O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
was O
answered O
by O
her O
saying O
directly O
— O
" O
I O
suppose O
Annie S-PERSON
was O
thinking O
of O
her O
London S-GPE
parties O

forgot O
how O
completely O
Gothic O
we O
are O

to O
hours O

every O
thing O
else O
in O
Devonshire S-GPE

you O
must O
try O

forget O
such O
superior O
pleasures O
to O

night O

my O
dear O
girl O

she O
added O
, O
jestingly O
, O
though O
the O
young O
lady O
felt O
it O
rather O
uncomfortably O
as O
earnest O
, O
" O

I O
fear O
you O
will O
find O

little O
amusement O

Alfred B-PERSON
Greville E-PERSON
at O
that O
moment O
came O
to O
claim O
Annie S-PERSON
as O
his O
partner O

she O
gladly O
joined O
him O

for O

Mrs. O

had O
" O
certainly O
no O
taste O
in O
dress O

never O
felt O
quite O
at O
her O
ease O
in O
her O
presence O

Cecil S-PERSON
and O
Lilla S-PERSON
were O
soon O
provided O
with O
little O
partners O
, O
and O
dancing O
with O
much O
more O
real O
delight O
than O
their O
sister O

was O
scarcely O
possible O
for O

much O
less O
a O
parent O

look O
at O
Caroline S-PERSON

night O

admiration O

was O
so O
animated O

so O
graceful O

so O
pleasing O

as O
such O
completely O
the O
center O
of O
attraction O
( O

really O
without O
any O

her O
part O

all O

the O
room O

lads O
congregated O
round O
her O

it O
was O
rather O
a O
difficult O
task O
to O
keep O
clear O
of O
offense O
, O
when O
so O
very O
many O
more O
entreated O
her O
to O
dance O
than O
the O
length O
of O
the O
evening O
permitted O

managed O
to O
talk O

all O

not O

neglect O
any O
of O
her O
own O
sex O

always O
refused O
to O
dance O
, O
if O
she O
fancied O
her O
being O
in O
a O
quadrille O
prevented O
any O
couple O
who O
had O
not O
danced O
so O
much O
, O

at O
those O
times O
contrived O
to O
conciliate O
five S-CARDINAL
or O
six S-CARDINAL
instead O
of O
only O
one O
. O
Emmeline S-PERSON
took O
charge O
of O
the O
younger O
children O
, O
often O
refusing O
to O
dance O
with O
older O
boys O
, O
who O
would O
have O
made O
her O
much O
pleasanter O
partners O

that O
she O
might O
join O
the O
little O
quadrille O

set O
them O
all O
right O

night O

seeming O
truly O
to O
enjoy O
herself O

" O
said O
Mrs. O
Greville S-PERSON
, O
addressing O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
standing O
rather O
apart O
at O
the O
moment O
, O
watching O
Caroline S-PERSON
with O
such O
mingled O
feelings O
of O
pride O
and O
dread O
, O
that O
she O
was O
quite O
glad O
when O
her O
friend's O
voice O
disturbed O
her O
train O
of O
thought O
. O
" O
She O
looked O
so O
ill O
in O
church O
yesterday S-DATE
, O
that O
I O
half O
feared O
we O
should O
not O
see O
her O
. O
I O
told O
her O
I O
was O
quite O
grieved O
that O
she O
was O
too O
unwell O
to O
be O
at O
Mr. O
Howard's S-PERSON
last B-DATE
Friday E-DATE
, O
and O
— O
" O
" O
What O
did O
she O
say O
? O
" O
inquired O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
anxiously O
. O
" O
That O
it O
was O
not O
illness O
which O
prevented O
her O
| | O
but O
she O
looked O
so O
confused O
and O
pained O
that O
I O
changed O
the O
subject O
directly O
, O
and O
the O
smile O
soon O
came O
back O
. O
" O
" O
You O
touched O
on O
a O
very O
painful O
theme O
, O
" O
replied O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
with O
real O
relief O
| | O
" O
Ellen S-PERSON
and O
I O
were O
not O
quite O
as O
good O
friends O
as O
we O
usually O
are O
, O
last B-DATE
week E-DATE
, O
and O
my O
poor O
little O
girl O
felt O
my O
severity O
more O
than O
I O
imagined O
or O
meant O
. O
I O
gave O
her O
to O
your O
dear O
Mary's S-PERSON
especial O
care O
to O
- O
night O
, O
for O
she O
is O
so O
timid O
, O
that O
left O
quite O
to O
herself O
, O
I O
was O
afraid O
it O
would O
be O
more O
pain O
than O
pleasure O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
has O
taken O
my O
hint O
most O
admirably O
, O
for O
Ellen S-PERSON
seems O
quite O
happy O
. O
" O
" O
It O
would O
be O
rather O
hard O
, O
if O
your O
little O
niece's O
were O
the O
only O
sad O
face O
in O
this O
scene O
of O
enjoyment O

surely O
, O
if O
ever O
there O
were O
happiness O
without O
alloy O

it O
is O
here O
. O
" O
" O
If O
you O
think O
so O
Mrs. O
Greville S-PERSON
, O
you O
will O
agree O
with O
my O
friend O
Morton S-PERSON
, O
who O
has O
just O
been O
half O
poetizing O
half O
philosophizing O
on O
this O
scene O
, O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
joining O
them O
, O
with O
the O
young O
clergyman O
leaning O
on O
his O
arm O
. O
" O
He O
says O
there O
is O
something O
singularly O
interesting O
in O
watching O
the O
countenances O
and O
movements O
of O
children O
, O
and O
in O
tracing O
the O
dawnings O
of O
respective O
characters O

" O
" O
You O
are O
not O
one O
of O
those O
, O
then O
, O
who O
think O
childhood O
a O
mere O
negative O
species O
of O
existence O
, O
" O
rejoined O
Mrs. O
Greville S-PERSON
. O
" O
Indeed O
I O
do O
not O

there O
is O
much O
more O
pleasure O
to O
me O
in O
watching O
such O
a O
scene O
, O
than O
a O
similar O
one O
of O
adults O
. O
It O
is O
full O
of O
that O
kind O
of O
poetry O
, O
which O
, O
from O
the O
beauty O
and O
freshness O
of O
the O
present O
, O
creates O
a O
future O
of O
happiness O
or O
sorrow O
, O
good O
or O
evil O
, O
as O
something O
in O
each O
countenance O
seems O
dimly O
to O
foretell O
. O
How O
many O
will O
be O
the O
longing O
thoughts O
thrown O
back O
in O
after O
years S-DATE
upon O
to O
- O
night O

" O
" O
Do O
you O
think O
then O
childhood O
the O
happiest O
season O
of O
life O
? O
" O
He O
answered O
in O
the O
affirmative O
, O
but O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
shook O
his O
head O
. O
" O
I O
differ O
from O
you O
, O
my O
good O
friend O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O
" O
Childhood O
feels O
its O
griefs O
as O
bitterly O
as O
those O
of O
maturer O
years O
. O
We O
are O
apt O
to O
think O
it O
was O
all O
joy O
in O
the O
retrospect O
, O
perhaps O
because O
it O
has O
not O
the O
anxiety O
and O
cares O
of O
riper O
years O
, O
but O
sorrow O
itself O
is O
felt O
as O
keenly O
. O
From O
reason O
not O
being O
perfectly O
formed O
, O
the O
difficulty O
to O
control O
self O
- O
will O
, O
to O
acquiesce O
in O
the O
, O
to O
them O
, O
incomprehensible O
wishes O
of O
parents O
or O
guardians O
, O
the O
restraint O
they O
are O
often O
compelled O
to O
use O
, O
must O
be O
all O
trials O
even O
to O
well O
- O
regulated O
children O
, O
and O
to O
those O
subject O
to O
the O
caprices O
of O
weakness O
, O
indolence O
, O
neglect O
, O
indulgence O
at O
one S-CARDINAL
time O
, O
and O
tyranny O
at O
another O
, O
feelings O
disbelieved O
in O
, O
and O
therefore O
never O
studied O
or O
soothed O
— O
the O
little O
heart O
thrown O
back O
upon O
itself O
— O
Morton S-PERSON
, O
believe O
me O
, O
these O
are O
trials O
as O
full O
of O
suffering O
, O
and O
as O
hard O
to O
be O
endured O
, O
as O
those O
which O
belong O
to O
manhood O
. O
" O
" O
You O
may O
be O
right O
, O
" O
replied O
Morton S-PERSON
| | O
" O
but O
do O
you O
not O
think O
there O
is O
an O
elasticity O
in O
childhood O
which O
flings O
off O
sorrow O
, O
and O
can O
realize O
happiness O
sooner O
than O
older O
years O
? O
" O
" O
Undoubtedly O
, O
and O
most O
happy O
it O
is O
that O
they O
are O
so O
constituted O
, O
else O
what O
would O
become O
of O
them O
if O
their O
susceptibilities O
for O
either O
joy O
or O
sorrow O
are O
equally O
quick O
. O
If O
the O
former O
did O
not O
balance O
the O
latter O
, O
how O
would O
their O
tender O
frames O
and O
quick O
affections O
bear O
their O
burden O
? O
The O
idea O
that O
childhood O
is O
in O
itself O
the O
happiest O
season O
in O
life O
is O
so O
far O
mischievous O
, O
that O
it O
prevents O
the O
necessary O
care O
and O
watchfulness O
, O
which O
alone O
can O
make O
it O
so O
. O
But O
we O
must O
not O
philosophize O
any O
more O
, O
for O
it O
has O
made O
us O
all O
grave O
. O
I O
see O
my O
wife O
is O
addressing O
Miss O
Grahame S-PERSON
, O
and O
I O
think O
it O
is O
for O
music O
. O
Come O
, O
Morton S-PERSON
, O
take O
Mrs. O
Greville S-PERSON
to O
the O
music O
- O
room O
, O
and O
woo O
melody O
instead O
of O
poetry O
for O
the B-TIME
next I-TIME
half I-TIME
hour E-TIME
. O
Miss O
Grahame S-PERSON
promises O
to O
be O
a O
very O
fair O
musician O
, O
so O
you O
will O
be O
charmed O
. O
" O
They O
adjourned O
to O
the O
music O
- O
room O
, O
where O
Percy S-PERSON
had O
already O
gallantly O
conducted O
Annie S-PERSON
, O
and O
several O
of O
the O
guests O
, O
young O
and O
old O
, O
seconded O
the O
move O
: O
Annie B-PERSON
Grahame E-PERSON
really O
played O
remarkably O
well O
, O
so O
far O
as O
execution O
and O
brilliancy O
were O
concerned O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
was O
delighted O
at O
the O
expression O
of O
Grahame's S-PERSON
face O
as O
he O
listened O
to O
his O
child O
and O
the O
applause O
she O
excited O
. O
" O
Why O
will O
he O
not O
try O
to O
win O
his O
home O
- O
affections O
, O
" O
she O
thought O
, O
" O
when O
he O
is O
so O
formed O
to O
enjoy O
them O
? O
and O
why O
, O
why O
has O
Helen S-PERSON
so O
indolently O
, O
so O
foolishly O
cast O
away O
her O
happiness O
? O
" O
was O
the O
thought O
that O
followed O
at O
the O
contrast O
which O
Lady O
Helen's S-PERSON
face O
presented O
to O
her O
husband's O
| | O
she O
knew O
Annie S-PERSON
played O
well O
, O
she O
had O
heard O
it O
from O
very O
superior O
judges O
, O
and O
how O
could O
it O
concern O
her O
what O
the O
present O
company O
thought O
? O
A O
very O
pretty O
vocal O
duet O
from O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
sisters O
followed O
, O
and O
soon O
afterward O
Caroline S-PERSON
approached O
the O
music O
- O
stand O
, O
near O
which O
Percy S-PERSON
and O
Mr. O
Morton S-PERSON
were O
talking O
, O
and O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
with O
his O
usual O
love O
of O
provoking O
, O
exclaimed O
— O
" O
You O
surely O
are O
not O
going O
to O
play O
after O
Miss O
Grahame S-PERSON
, O
Caroline S-PERSON
. O
If O
your O
powers O
deserted O
you O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
hours I-TIME
ago E-TIME
, O
and O
prevented O
the O
execution O
of O
a O
waltz O
, O
they O
would O
certainly O
do O
you O
a O
charity O
in O
deserting O
you O
completely O
now O
. O
" O
Caroline's S-PERSON
cheek O
burned O
, O
but O
she O
answered O
, O
with O
spirit O
— O
" O
Mamma O
desired O
me O
to O
oblige O
my O
friends O

would O
not O

disgrace O
myself O

her O

" O

not O
heed O
your O
brother O

Miss O
Hamilton S-PERSON

Mr. O
Morton S-PERSON
, O
taking O
the O
music O
from O
her O
, O

offering O
her O
his O
arm O
to O
lead O
her O
to O
the O
piano O

" O
I O
have O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
hearing O
you O
often O

those O

must O
be O
flattering O

hers O

master's O
heart O

in O
his O
pupil's O
progress O

not O
teach O

merely O
superintend O

" O
Caroline S-PERSON
was O
seated O
at O
the O
instrument O
as O
he O
spoke O
, O
and O
there O
was O
something O
in O
his O
few O
words O
touching O
a O
right O
chord O
| | O
for O
as O
she O
began O
to O
play O
she O
certainly O
thought O
more O
of O
her O
mother O
than O
any O
one O
else O

determined O
, O
if O
possible O
, O
that O
others O
should O
think O
with O
Mr. O
Morton S-PERSON
, O
forgetting O
at O
the O
moment O
that O
very O
few O

their O
own O

circle O

knew O

Morton S-PERSON
was O
certainly O
right O
as O
to O
the O
amount O
of O
admiration O

equaling O
, O
if O
not O
surpassing O
, O
that O
bestowed O
on O
Miss O

there O
was O
a O
soul O
, O
a O
depth O
of O
expression O

feeling O
, O
in O
Caroline's O
far O
simpler O
piece O

that O
won O
its O
way O
to O
the O
heart O
at O
once O

if O
it O
did O
not O
surprise O

pleased O
more O

earnest O
wish O

again O

Does O
not O

" O
she O
is O

" O
" O
But O
do O
you O
think O
natural O
taste O
can O
be O
traced O
so O
early O

replied O
Mrs. O

earnestly O
. O
" O
If O

child O

allowed O
leisure O

choose O
its O

not O

natural O
taste O

display O
itself O

Not O
that O
I O
would O
depend O
entirely O
on O
that O

because O
I O
think O
it O
right O

cultivate O

fine O

giving O
more O

has O
shown O
no O

I O
do O
not O

in O
a B-DATE

" O
Your O

" O
replied O
Mrs. O

smiling O
" O
Emmeline S-PERSON

quite O
sure O

learn O

If O
she O

" O
" O
When O
the O
room O
is O

quite O
so O
full O
: O
she O
has O
not O
half O
her O
sister's O
confidence O
, O

so O
large O
an O
audience O
would O
frighten O
away O
all O
her O

I O
will O
promise O
you O

sweet O
song O

" O
she O
added O
, O
as O
Herbert S-PERSON
approached O
, O

eagerly O
whispered O
some O
request O

" O
That O

my O
persuasions O
can O
prevail O
on O
my O

your O
influence O

mine O
be O
enough O

" O
" O
What O
, O
with O
Mary S-PERSON
? O
I O
rather O
think O
, O
your O
request O
in O
this O
case O

be O
of O
more O
weight O
than O
mine O

" O
and O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes E-TIME
afterward O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
led O
the O
blushing O
, O
timid O
girl O
in O
triumph O
to O
the O
piano O
. O
Her O
voice O
, O
which O
was O
peculiarly O
sweet O
and O
thrilling O
, O
though O
not O
strong O
, O
trembled O
audibly O
as O
she O
commenced O

but O
Herbert S-PERSON
was O
turning O
over O
the O
leaves O
of O
her O
music O
, O
his O
mother O
was O
standing O
close O
beside O
her O
, O
and O
after O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
few O
bars O
her O
enthusiastic O
spirit O
forgot O
the O
presence O
of O
all O
, O
save O
those O
she O
loved O
, O
and O
the O
spirit O
of O
her O
song O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
never O
listened O
to O
and O
looked O
at O
her O
at O
such O
moments O
without O
a O
trembling O
foreboding O
she O
vainly O
struggled O
to O
overcome O
. O
There O
was O
something O
in O
those O
deep O
blue O
, O
earnest O
eyes O
, O
the O
hectic O
color O
that O
with O
the O
least O
exertion O
rose O
to O
her O
cheek O
, O
the O
transparency O
of O
complexion O
, O
the O
warm O
and O
elevated O
spirit O
, O
the O
almost O
angel O
temper O
and O
endurance O
in O
her O
peculiarly O
tried O
lot O
, O
that O
scarcely O
seemed O
of O
earth O

and O
never O
was O
that O
sad O
foreboding O
stronger O
than O
at O
that O
moment O
, O
as O
she O
looked O
round O
the O
crowd O
of O
young O
and O
happy O
faces O
, O
and O
none O
seemed O
to O
express O
the O
same O
as O
Mary's S-PERSON
. O
She O
could O
scarcely O
command O
her O
voice O
and O
smile O
sufficiently O
to O
warmly O
thank O
her O
young O
favorite O
as O
she O
ceased O

but O
Mary S-PERSON
was O
more O
than O
satisfied O
by O
the O
fond O
pressure O
of O
her O
hand O
. O
This O
little O
interruption O
to O
the O
actual O
business O
of O
the O
evening O
only O
increased O
the O
zest O
and O
enjoyment O
, O
when O
dancing O
recommenced O
. O
Even O
the O
call O
to O
supper O
was O
obeyed O
with O
reluctance O
, O
and O
speedily O
accomplished O

sooner O

The O
hours O
had O
worn O
away O

seemed O

on O
gossamer O

wings O

as O
each O
happy O
child O
felt O
assured O
that O
the O
delight O

not O
last O
much O
longer O

the O
longing O
to O
dance O
to O
the O
very O
last O
moment O
seemed O
to O
increase O

Emmeline's S-PERSON
excitable O
spirit O

thrown O
off O
all O

feeling O
by O
the O
length O

fatiguing O

lasted O

there O
was O
really O
some O
truth O
in O
his O
words O

desired O

stop O

up O

so O
much O

obedience O

most O

wished O
to O
hear O

play O

with O
more O

The O
tone O

still O
more O
than O

enough O

tears O

smiles O

reproach O
her O

she O
suddenly O
burst O
into O
tears O

exclamations O

sympathy O

burst O
from O
her O

notice O
of O
a O
reply O

actually O
made O
her O
heart O
throb O
with O
thankfulness O

that O
her O
lessons O

so O
fully O
understood O

practiced O
by O
one O
naturally O
so O
gentle O

timid O
as O
her O
Emmeline S-PERSON
: O
while O
Mrs. O
Allan S-PERSON
knew O
not O
what O
to O
answer O

from O
a O
feeling O
of O

tacitly O

Emmeline S-PERSON
looked O
timidly O
up O
in O
her O
mother's O
face O

be O
quite O
sure O

her O

subsided O

all O
checked O

taking O
Mrs. O

offered O

went O
directly O
to O
the O
music O

Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
lingered O
to O
desire O

come O
up O

the O
cause O

to O
form O
the O
last O
quadrille O

reserve O
a O
place O
, O
if O
he O

could O
, O
for O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
as O
they O
would O
not O
begin O
till O
she O
had O
done O
. O
Her O
little O
girl O
was O
playing O
as O
she O
rejoined O
her O
, O
and O
it O
really O
was O
a O
pretty O
picture O
, O
her O
fairy O
figure O
with O
her O
tiny O
harp O
, O
and O
her O
sweet O
face O
seeming O
to O
express O
the O
real O
feeling O
with O
which O
she O
played O
. O
There O
was O
no O
execution O
in O
the O
simple O
Highland S-LOC
air O
, O
but O
her O
vivid O
imagination O
lent O
it O
a O
meaning O
, O
and O
so O
, O
when O
fairly O
playing O
, O
she O
did O
not O
mind O
it O
. O
Mrs. O
Allan S-PERSON
had O
lost O
a O
little O
girl O
just O
at O
Emmeline's O
age O
, O
who O
had O
also O
played O
the O
harp O
, O
and O
there O
was O
something O
in O
her O
caress O
and O
thanks O
, O
after O
she O
had O
done O
, O
that O
made O
Emmeline S-PERSON
stand O
quietly O
at O
her O
side O
, O
without O
heeding O
the O
praises O
that O
were O
lavished O
round O
her O
. O
Herbert S-PERSON
at O
that O
moment O
appeared O
with O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
young O
Allans S-PERSON

do O
, O

added O
Mrs. O
Allan S-PERSON
, O
as O
her O
son O
gayly O
pleaded O
his O
own O
cause O

Emmeline S-PERSON
only O
waited O
to O
read O
her O
mother's O
consent O
in O
her O
eyes O
, O
for O
she O
thought O
that O
she O
ought O
not O
to O
dance O
any O
more O

and O
in O
another O
minute O
the O
joyous O
music O
had O
resounded O
, O

she O
was O
dancing O

chatting O
as O
gayly O

happily O
as O
if O
there O
had O
been O
no O
interruption O
to O
her O
joy O
. O
" O

leave O
all O

asked O
Mr. O
Grahame S-PERSON
, O
jestingly O
of O
Edward S-PERSON
while O
waiting O
for O
his O
wife O

daughters O
, O
who O
were O
the O
last O
departures O
( O
much O
to O
Annie's S-NORP
horror O

be O
cloaked O

shawled O

his O
very O
indignant O

ship O

take O
our O
home O

you O

can O
not O

so O
poetize O

maternal O
properties O

" O
" O
Only O

him O

laughing O
heartily O

" O

Edward S-PERSON
, O
earnestly O

" O
I O
know O
there O
are O
many O
hardships O

I O
dare O

shall O
find O

more O
disagreeable O

imagine O

I O
shall O
get O

so O
cowardly O

it O
no O
grief O

up O

" O

Edward S-PERSON

laughing O

adding O
, O
as O
he O
put O
his O
arm O
affectionately O
round O
Ellen S-PERSON

" O

as O
he O
laid O
his O
hand O
kindly O
on O
Ellen's S-PERSON
head O

turned O

summons O

young O
party O

no O

that O
it O
would O
be O
infinitely O
more O
agreeable O

up O
all O
night O
, O

talk O
of O
the O
only O
too O
quickly O
concluded O

to O
retire O

the O

somewhat O
too O
well O
regulated O

such O

no O

their O

according O

Percy's S-PERSON

pleasure O

somewhat O
too O
old O
to O
care O
for O

them O
now O
as O
a O
restraint O
. O
Herbert S-PERSON
only O
exchanged O
one S-CARDINAL
kind O
of O
happiness O
for O
another O
. O
Edward S-PERSON
looked O
to O
every O
month O
that O
passed O
, O
as O
bringing O
nearer O
the O
attainment O
of O
his O
wishes O

and O
he O
was O
so O
fond O
of O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
, O
and O
so O
quick O
at O
learning O
, O
and O
such O
a O
favorite O
with O
all O
his O
schoolfellows O
, O
that O
he O
did O
not O
care O
at O
all O
when O
the O
time O
of O
work O
came O
again O
. O
Ellen S-PERSON
and O
Emmeline S-PERSON
both O
found O
it O
very O
difficult O
to O
like O
their O
lessons O
again O
| | O
especially O
the O
latter O
, O
who O
felt O
as O
if O
work O
and O
regularity O
were O
most O
particularly O
disagreeable O
things O
, O
and O
sometimes O
was O
almost O
in O
despair O
as O
to O
her O
ever O
enjoying O
them O
again O
| | O
but O
she O
tried O
very O
hard O
to O
overcome O
indolence O
, O
and O
never O
give O
way O
to O
petulance O
, O
and O
succeeded O
, O
so O
as O
to O
win O
her O
the O
delight O
of O
both O
her O
parents' O
approbation O
. O
Indulgence O
always O
made O
her O
feel O
as O
if O
no O
effort O
on O
her O
part O
was O
too O
great O
to O
prove O
how O
much O
she O
felt O
it O

and O
when O
any O
one O
, O
old O
or O
young O
, O
experiences O
this O
sort O
of O
feeling O
, O
they O
need O
never O
be O
afraid O
but O
that O
they O
will O
succeed O
in O
their O
efforts O
, O
painful O
and O
hard O
as O
they O
may O
at O
first O
seem O
. O
It O
was O
not O
so O
difficult O
for O
Ellen S-PERSON
as O
for O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
because O
she O
was O
less O
able O
to O
realize O
such O
an O
intensity O
of O
pleasure O
. O
She O
seemed O
safer O
when O
regularly O
employed O
| | O
and O
besides O
, O
to O
work O
hard O
at O
her O
respective O
studies O
, O
was O
one O
of O
the O
very O
few O
things O
which O
she O
could O
do O
to O
prove O
how O
much O
she O
loved O
her O
aunt O

and O
accustomed O
from O
such O
early O
childhood O
to O
conquer O
inclination O
, O
and O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
never O
to O
fancy O
pleasure O
and O
indulgence O
were O
her O
due O
, O
there O
was O
happiness O
enough O
for O
her O
even O
in O
their O
more O
regular O
life O
: O
but O
to O
Caroline S-PERSON
the O
change O
was O
actually O
unbearable O
. O
While O
admiration O
and O
praise O
only O
incited O
Emmeline S-PERSON
to O
greater O
exertions O
, O
they O
caused O
Caroline S-PERSON
completely O
to O
relax O
in O
hers O
, O
and O
to O
give O
, O
in O
consequence O
, O
as O
much O
trouble O
and O
annoyance O
as O
she O
had O
received O
pleasure O
. O
The O
perseverance O
in O
her O
various O
studies O
, O
especially O
in O
music O
, O
the O
unceasing O
control O
over O
her O
temper O
, O
which O
before O
the O
holidays O
she O
had O
so O
striven O
for O
, O
had O
now O
entirely O
given O
way O
. O
It O
was O
much O
less O
trouble O
for O
her O
to O
learn O
than O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
therefore O
her O
studies O
with O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
were O
generally O
well O
performed O
| | O
but O
the O
admiration O
she O
had O
excited O
made O
her O
long O
for O
more O
, O
and O
believe O
herself O
a O
person O
deserving O
much O
more O
consideration O
and O
respect O
than O
she O
received O
from O
her O
own O
family O
. O
These O
thoughts O
persisted O
in O
, O
of O
course O
, O
produced O
and O
retained O
ill O
- O
temper O
| | O
which O
, O
as O
there O
was O
no O
longer O
any O
fear O
of O
her O
being O
debarred O
by O
its O
indulgence O
from O
any O
pleasure O
, O
she O
made O
no O
attempt O
to O
overcome O
. O
The O
praise O
bestowed O
on O
her O
music O
, O
made O
her O
fancy O
herself O
a O
much O
greater O
proficient O
than O
she O
really O
was O
, O
and O
though O
her O
love O
of O
music O
was O
great O
, O
her O
love O
of O
praise O
was O
greater O
| | O
and O
so O
she O
not O
only O
relaxed O
in O
her O
practice O
, O
but O
inwardly O
murmured O
at O
the O
very O
little O
praise O
she O
received O
from O
her O
mother O
. O
" O
How O
can O
you O
give O
mamma O
so O
much O
trouble O
, O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
when O
you O
know O
you O
can O
do O
so O
much O
better O
? O
" O
Herbert S-PERSON
exclaimed O
, O
one B-DATE
day E-DATE
, O
when O
an O
attack O
of O
weakness O
, O
to O
which O
he O
was O
liable O
, O
had O
confined O
him O
to O
a O
sofa O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
after O
giving O
her O
usual O
hour's O
lesson O
, O
in O
which O
Caroline S-PERSON
had O
chosen O
to O
do O
nothing O
, O
had O
left O
her O
in O
very O
evident O
displeasure O
, O
and O
even O
Herbert S-PERSON
was O
roused O
to O
most O
unusual O
indignation O
. O
" O
What O
is O
the O
use O
of O
practicing O
day O
after O
day O
? O
" O
was O
her O
angry O
reply O

" O
I O
am O
sure O
I O
should O
play O
just O
as O
well O

I O

" O
" O

not O

Caroline S-PERSON

" O
" O
No O
, O
because O
then O
I O
had O
something O
to O
practice O
for O

" O
" O
And O
have O
you O
nothing O
now O

— O
Is O
mamma's O
approbation O
nothing O

— O
Is O
the O
pleasure O
you O
give O
all O

us O

by O
your O
talent O

nothing O

— O
Oh O
, O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
why O
will O
you O
throw O
away O
so O
much O
real O
gratification O
, O
for O
the O
vain O
desire O
of O
universal O
admiration O
? O
" O
" O
There O
surely O
can O
be O
no O
harm O
, O
Herbert S-PERSON
, O
in O
wishing O
to O
be O
universally O
loved O
and O
admired O
. O
" O
" O
There O
is O
, O
when O
it O
makes O
you O
discontented O

unhappy O

blind O
to O
the O
love O

admiration O

your O

What O
is O
the O
praise O

receiving O

" O
was O
the O
cold O
reply O

" O

for O
at O
this O
moment O

am O
not O
disposed O
either O
to O
listen O
to O
or O
profit O
by O
it O
, O
" O
interrupted O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
and O
she O
left O
the O
room O
in O
anger O
. O
A O
faint O
flush O
rose O
to O
the O
pale O
cheek O
of O
her O
brother O
, O
but O
he O
quickly O
conquered O
the O
natural O
irritation O
, O
and O
sought O
his O
mother O
, O
by O
every O
fond O
attention O
on O
his O
part O
, O
to O
remove O
the O
pain O
of O
Caroline's O
conduct O
. O
This O
continued O
for O
about B-DATE
a I-DATE
fortnight E-DATE
, O
at O
the O
end O
of O
which O
time O
, O
Caroline S-PERSON
suddenly O
resumed O
her O
music O
with O
assiduity O
, O
and O
there O
were O
no O
more O
ebullitions O
of O
ill O
- O
temper O
. O
Herbert S-PERSON
hoped O
his O
expostulations O
were O
taking O
effect O
| | O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
trusted O
that O
her O
child O
was O
becoming O
sensible O
of O
her O
past O
folly O
, O
and O
trying O
to O
conquer O
it O
, O
and O
banish O
its O
memory O
herself O
: O
both O
, O
however O
, O
were O
mistaken O
. O
Annie B-PERSON
Grahame E-PERSON
had O
imparted O
to O
her O
friend O
, O
in O
strict O
confidence O
, O
that O
her O
mother O
intended O
giving O
a O
grand O
ball O
about O
the B-DATE
end I-DATE
of I-DATE
February E-DATE
, O
and O
meant O
to O
entreat O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
as O
a O
personal O
favor O
, O
to O
let O
Caroline S-PERSON
be O
present O
. O
Caroline S-PERSON
little O
knew O
the O
very O
slight O
foundation O
Annie S-PERSON
had O
for O
this O
assertion O
. O
Lady O
Helen S-PERSON
had O
merely O
said O
, O
perhaps O
she O
would O
ask O
| | O
and O
this O
was O
only O
said O
, O
because O
she O
was O
too O
indolent O
and O
weak O
to O
say O
" O
No O
" O
at O
once O
. O
Not O
that O
she O
had O
any O
unkind O
feeling O
toward O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
but O
simply O
because O
she O
was O
perfectly O
certain O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
would O
not O
consent O
, O
and O
to O
persuade O
as O
earnestly O
as O
Annie S-PERSON
wished O
was O
really O
too O
much O
trouble O
. O
Caroline's S-PERSON
wishes O
in O
this O
instance O
triumphed O
over O
her O
better O
judgment O
, O
for O
had O
she O
allowed O
herself O
to O
think O
soberly O
, O
she O
ought O
to O
have O
known O
her O
mother's O
principles O
of O
action O
sufficiently O
, O
not O
to O
entertain O
the O
slightest O
hope O
of O
going O
. O
The O
invitations O
( O
three B-DATE
weeks' E-DATE
notice O
) O
for O
her O
parents O
and O
brothers O
came O
. O
In O
them O
she O
did O
not O
expect O
to O
be O
included O
, O
but O
when O
above O
a O
week O
passed O
, O
and O
still O
not O
a O
word O
was O
said O
, O
disappointment O
took O
the O
place O
of O
hope O
, O
and O
it O
was O
only O
the O
still O
lingering O
belief O
that O
she O
might O
go O
, O
even O
at O
the O
last O
moment O
, O
that O
prevented O
the O
return O
of O
ill O
- O
temper O
. O
Now O
Lady O
Helen S-PERSON
really O
had O
asked O
, O
though O
she O
did O
not O
persuade O
| | O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
thanked O
her O
, O
but O
, O
as O
she O
expected O
, O
decidedly O
refused O
. O
" O
Caroline S-PERSON
was O
much O
too O
young O
, O
" O
she O
said O
, O
" O
for O
such O
a O
party O
. O
Did O
she O
know O
any O
thing O
about O
being O
asked O
? O
" O
Lady O
Helen S-PERSON
said O
, O
with O
truth O
, O
that O
she O
had O
not O
mentioned O
the O
subject O
to O
her O
, O
and O
had O
desired O
Annie S-PERSON
to O
be O
equally O
silent O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
quite O
forgot O
that O
Miss O
Grahame S-PERSON
was O
not O
famous O
for O
obedience O
, O
and O
, O
relying O
on O
her O
friend's O
assurance O
, O
determined O
on O
not O
saying O
any O
thing O
to O
Caroline S-PERSON
about O
it O
| | O
wishing O
to O
spare O
her O
the O
pain O
which O
she O
knew O
her O
refusal O
would O
inflict O
. O
As O
it O
happened O
, O
it O
would O
have O
been O
better O
if O
she O
had O
spoken O
. O
The O
weather O
had O
prevented O
Caroline S-PERSON
from O
seeing O
Annie S-PERSON
, O
but O
she O
was O
quite O
sure O
she O
would O
not O
deceive O
her O
| | O
and O
her O
proud O
heart O
rebelled O
against O
her O
mother O
, O
not O
only O
for O
refusing O
Lady B-PERSON
Helen's E-PERSON
request O
, O
but O
for O
treating O
her O
so O
much O
like O
a O
child O
, O
as O
to O
hide O
that O
refusal O
from O
her O
. O
Under O
the O
influence O
of O
such O
thoughts O
, O
of O
course O
, O
her O
temper O
became O
more O
and O
more O
difficult O
to O
control O
and O
as O
a O
natural O
consequence O
, O
anger O
and O
irritation O
against O
her O
mother O
, O
and O
self O
- O
reproach O
for O
the O
indulgence O
of O
such O
feelings O
increased O
, O
till O
she O
became O
actually O
miserable O
. O
It O
happened O
that O
about O
this O
time O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
left O
Oakwood S-GPE
for O
a B-DATE
week E-DATE
on O
a O
visit O
to O
an O
invalid O
friend O
at O
Dartmouth S-ORG
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
had O
given O
her O
full O
liberty O
, O
promising O
that O
her O
pupils O
should O
lose O
nothing O
by O
her O
absence O
. O
She O
left O
on O
the B-DATE
Saturday E-DATE
, O
and O
the O
Thursday S-DATE
was O
Lady B-PERSON
Helen's E-PERSON
ball O
. O
On O
the B-DATE
Monday E-DATE
, O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
detained O
Edward S-PERSON
as O
he O
was O
leaving O
the O
library O
, O
after O
morning S-TIME
prayers O
, O
and O
told O
him O
that O
he O
had O
received O
a O
letter O
, O
which O
he O
thought O
might O
chance O
to O
interest O
him O
. O
Ten B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
afterward O
, O
Edward S-PERSON
rushed O
into O
the O
breakfast O
- O
room O
, O
in O
a O
state O
of O
such O
joyous O
excitement O
that O
he O
could O
scarcely O
speak O

" O
Wish O
me O
five S-CARDINAL

ten S-CARDINAL

twenty B-CARDINAL
thousand E-CARDINAL
joys O

he O
exclaimed O
, O
springing O
from O
chair O
to O
chair O
, O
as O
if O
velocity O
of O

interposed O
Percy S-PERSON

heartily O

But O
neither O

have O
wished O
me O
joy O
. O
I O
think O
I O
shall O
be O
offended O
. O
" O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
could O
not O
speak O
at O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
moment O
, O
for O
the O
joy O
, O
the O
animation O
of O
her O
nephew O
so O
recalled O
the O
day O
when O
her O
own O
much O
- O
loved O
brother O
, O
her O
darling O
Charles S-PERSON
, O
had O
rushed O
into O
her O
room O
, O
to O
tell O
her O
all O
his O
glee O
, O
for O
no O
one O
ever O
listened O
to O
and O
shared O
in O
his O
joys O
and O
troubles O
as O
she O
did O
. O
He O
was O
then O
scarcely O
older O
than O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
as O
full O
of O
hope O
and O
joy O
and O
buoyancy O
— O
where O
was O
he O
? O
Would O
his O
fate O
be O
that O
of O
the O
bright O
, O
beautiful O
boy O
before O
her O
? O
And O
as O
Edward S-PERSON
threw O
his O
arms O
round O
her O
neck O
, O
and O
kissed O
her O
again O
and O
again O
, O
telling O
her O
he O
could O
not O
be O
quite O
sure O
it O
was O
not O
all O
a O
dream O
, O
unless O
she O
wished O
him O
joy O
too O
it O
was O
the O
utmost O
effort O
to O
prevent O
the O
fast O
gathering O
tears O
, O
and O
so O
command O
her O
voice O
, O
that O
he O
should O
not O
hear O
her O
tremble O
. O
Poor O
Ellen S-PERSON
looked O
and O
felt O
bewildered O
. O
She O
had O
always O
tried O
to O
realize O
that O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
to O
be O
a O
sailor O
, O
must O
leave O
her O
| | O
and O
in O
fact O
aware O
that O
his O
summons O
would O
soon O
come O
, O
her O
aunt O
and O
uncle O
had O
often O
alluded O
to O
his O
departure O
before O
her O
, O
but O
still O
she O
had O
never O
thought O
it O
near O
| | O
and O
now O
the O
news O
was O
so O
sudden O
, O
and O
Edward S-PERSON
was O
so O
wild O
with O
joy O
she O
fancied O
she O
ought O
to O
rejoice O
too O
, O
but O
she O
could O
not O
| | O
and O
Percy S-PERSON
was O
obliged O
to O
ask O
her O
merrily O
, O
what O
ailed O
her O
, O
and O
if O
she O
could O
not O
trust O
to O
his O
being O
a O
much O
more O
worthy O
brother O
than O
such O
a O
water O
- O
rat O
, O
who O
had O
no O
business O
whatever O
on O
land O
, O
before O
she O
could O
take O
her O
place O
at O
the O
breakfast O
table O
and O
try O
to O
smile O
. O
But O
her O
eyes O
would O
rest O
on O
Edward S-PERSON
even O
then O
, O
and O
she O
felt O
as O
if O
there O
were O
something O
across O
her O
throat O
and O
she O
could O
not O
swallow O
the O
nice O
roll O
which O
Herbert S-PERSON
, O
had O
so O
kindly O
buttered O
and O
cut O
, O
and O
so O
quietly O
placed O
in O
her O
plate O
| | O
and O
when O
Edward S-PERSON
said O
something O
very O
funny O
, O
as O
he O
was O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
doing O
, O
and O
made O
them O
all O
laugh O
, O
she O
tried O
to O
laugh O
too O
, O
but O
instead O
of O
a O
laugh O
it O
was O
a O
sob O
that O
startled O
herself O
, O
for O
she O
was O
quite O
sure O
she O
did O
not O
mean O
to O
be O
so O
foolish O
: O
but O
instead O
of O
being O
reproved O
, O
as O
she O
was O
afraid O
she O
should O
be O
, O
she O
felt O
her O
aunt's O
arm O
thrown O
gently O
round O
her O
, O
till O
she O
could O
hide O
her O
face O
on O
her O
shoulder O
, O
and O
cry O
quite O
quietly O
for O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes E-TIME
, O
for O
they O
went O
on O
talking O
and O
laughing O
round O
the O
breakfast O
- O
table O
, O
and O
nobody O
took O
any O
notice O
of O
her O
, O
which O
she O
was O
quite O
glad O
of O
, O
for O
she O
could O
not O
bear O
Edward S-PERSON
to O
think O
she O
was O
unhappy O
when O
he O
was O
so O
pleased O
. O
And O
after O
breakfast O
, O
though O
he O
was O
in O
such O
a O
desperate O
hurry O
to O
tell O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
the O
good O
news O
, O
that O
when O
he O
did O
set O
off O
, O
he O
left O
even O
Percy S-PERSON
far O
behind O
him O
, O
he O
found O
time O
to O
give O
her O
a O
hearty O
kiss O
, O
and O
to O
tell O
her O
that O
he O
loved O
her O
very O
much O
, O
though O
he O
could O
not O
help O
being O
so O
glad O
he O
was O
going O
to O
sea O
| | O
and O
that O
he O
was O
quite O
proud O
of O
her O
, O
because O
though O
he O
knew O
she O
was O
very O
sorry O
he O
was O
going O
, O
she O
did O
not O
cry O
and O
make O
a O
fuss O
as O
some O
selfish O
people O
would O
| | O
and O
then O
she O
really O
did O
smile O
. O
" O
It O
is O
Monday S-DATE
morning O
, O
my O
dears O
, O
and O
I O
find O
Ellis S-PERSON
and O
Morris S-PERSON
require O
my O
attention O
for O
a O
longer O
time O
than O
I O
expected O
, O
" O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
said O
, O
as O
she O
entered O
the O
school O
- O
room O
, O
and O
found O
the O
three S-CARDINAL
girls O
preparing O
their O
books O
, O
" O
so O
I O
must O
set O
you O
all O
to O
work O
, O
and O
see O
how O
well O
you O
can O
get O
on O
without O
me O
till O
eleven S-DATE
, O
when O
I O
will O
rejoin O
you O
. O
I O
shall O
order O
the O
carriage O
at O
half O
- O
past O
twelve O
, O
and O
if O
all O
I O
require O
is O
completed O
, O
we O
will O
pay O
your O
favorite O
old O
ruin O
a O
visit O
, O
Emmy O
| | O
the O
morning O
is O
so O
lovely O
, O
that O
I O
think O
we O
may O
venture O
to O
take O
our O
sketch O
- O
books O
, O
and O
see O
what O
other O
part O
of O
Berry B-PERSON
Pomeroy E-PERSON
we O
can O
take O
pencil O
possession O
of O
. O
" O
Such O
an O
anticipation O
was O
quite O
enough O
for O
Emmeline S-PERSON
. O
Her O
dance O
about O
the O
room O
was O
only O
checked O
by O
the O
idea O
that O
her O
lessons O
would O
never O
be O
ready O
, O
nor O
her O
exercises O
and O
sums O
done O
, O
unless O
she O
sat O
quietly O
down O
, O
and O
so O
, O
with O
a O
great O
effort O
, O
she O
gave O
all O
her O
attention O
to O
her O
various O
tasks O
, O
and O
mastered O
them O
even O
before O
her O
mother O
returned O
. O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
though O
she O
tried O
quite O
as O
much O
, O
was O
not O
so O
successful O
. O
The B-PERSON
Prince I-PERSON
William E-PERSON
would O
sail O
in O
miniature O
on O
her O
slate O
, O
over O
all O
her O
figures O
. O
The O
recollection O
of O
the O
awful O
storm O
they O
had O
encountered O
on O
their O
voyage O
to O
England S-GPE
would O
return O
so O
vividly O
, O
that O
the O
very O
room O
seemed O
to O
heave O
. O
And O
then O
— O
but O
she O
could O
not O
make O
out O
why O
she O
should O
think O
about O
that O
then O
— O
her O
mother's O
death O
- O
bed O
came O
before O
her O
and O
her O
promise O
, O
and O
it O
seemed O
harder O
still O
to O
part O
with O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
from O
a O
vague O
dread O
that O
came O
over O
her O
, O
but O
still O
she O
tried O
to O
attend O
to O
what O
she O
had O
to O
do O
, O
and O
congratulated O
herself O
on O
its O
completion O
before O
her O
aunt O
appeared O
. O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
alone O
, O
was O
determined O
not O
to O
work O
. O
Because O
she O
had O
not O
made O
herself O
miserable O
enough O
already O
, O
the O
most O
unfounded O
jealousy O
entered O
her O
head O
from O
seeing O
her O
mother's O
caressing O
kindness O
toward O
Ellen S-PERSON
at O
breakfast O
| | O
why O
was O
not O
her O
manner O
as O
kind O
to O
her O
! O
She O
was O
quite O
as O
unhappy O
, O
and O
her O
mother O
must O
see O
it O
, O
but O
she O
took O
no O
notice O
of O
her O
— O
only O
of O
Ellen S-PERSON
. O
She O
might O
be O
cross O
sometimes O
, O
but O
she O
never O
told O
stories O
or O
tried O
to O
hide O
her O
faults O
, O
and O
it O
was O
very O
hard O
and O
unjust O
that O
she O
should O
be O
treated O
so O
like O
a O
child O
, O
and O
Ellen S-PERSON
made O
so O
much O
of O
| | O
and O
so O
she O
thought O
and O
thought O
, O
not O
attempting O
to O
do O
a O
single O
thing O
till O
she O
actually O
made O
herself O
believe O
, O
for O
the O
time O
, O
that O
her O
kind O
, O
indulgent O
mother O
had O
no O
love O
for O
her O
| | O
and O
every O
thing O
looked O
blacker O
than O
before O
. O
She O
made O
no O
effort O
to O
rouse O
herself O
even O
in O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
presence O
, O
but O
listened O
to O
her O
remonstrances O
with O
such O
extreme O
carelessness O
, O
almost O
insolence O
, O
that O
her O
mother O
felt O
her O
patience O
failing O
. O
The O
self O
- O
control O
, O
however O
, O
for O
which O
she O
had O
successfully O
striven O
, O
enabled O
her O
so O
to O
overcome O
the O
irritation O
, O
as O
to O
retain O
her O
own O
quiet O
dignity O
, O
and O
simply O
to O
desire O
Caroline S-PERSON
to O
give O
her O
attention O
at O
once O
to O
her O
studies O
, O
and O
conquer O
her O
ill O
- O
temper O
, O
or O
not O
to O
think O
of O
accompanying O
them O
on O
their O
excursion O
, O
as O
idleness O
and O
peevishness O
were O
better O
left O
to O
themselves O
. O
An O
insolent O
and O
haughty O
reply O
rose O
to O
Caroline's S-PERSON
lips O
| | O
but O
with O
an O
effort O
she O
remained O
silent O
, O
her O
flushed O
forehead O
alone O
denoting O
the O
internal O
agitation O
. O
Emmeline's O
diligence O
and O
the O
approbation O
she O
received O
irritated O
her O
still O
more O
| | O
but O
she O
rejoiced O
when O
she O
heard O
her O
mother O
tell O
Ellen S-PERSON
there O
was O
not O
a O
correct O
line O
in O
her O
French S-NORP
exercise O
, O
and O
her O
sum O
, O
a O
compound O
long O
division O
, O
wrong O
from O
the O
very O
first S-ORDINAL
figure O
. O
But O
the O
pleasure O
soon O
gave O
place O
to O
indignant O
anger O
, O
when O
, O
instead O
of O
the O
reproof O
which O
she O
believed O
would O
follow O
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
said O
very O
kindly O
— O
" O
I O
should O
very O
much O
like O
these O
done O
correctly O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON

we O
go O
out O

yourself O
in O
that O
bay O
window O

there O
are O
a O
table O

chair O
all O
ready O
for O
you O
, O
and O
we O
shall O
not O
interrupt O
you O
as O
we O
should O
if O
you O
remain O
at O
this O
table O

I O
know O
they O
are O
both O
very O
difficult O
, O
to O

day O
especially O
, O

the O
more O
merit O
in O
their O
accomplishment O
, O
you O
know O
the O
more O
pleased O
I O
shall O
be O
. O
" O
Ellen S-PERSON
obeyed O
directly O
| | O
a O
little O
care O
, O
and O
with O
the O
assistance O
of O
her O
grammar O
, O
which O
her O
aunt O
permitted O
her O
to O
refer O
to O
, O
instead O
of O
depending O
entirely O
on O
her O
memory O
that O
morning O
, O
enabled O
her O
to O
succeed O
with O
her O
French S-LANGUAGE

but O
four S-CARDINAL
times O
was O
that O
tormenting O
sum O
returned O
to O
, O
till O
at O
last O
her O
tears O
effaced O
the O
figures O

fast O

were O
written O

Still O
, O
patience O
and O
resolution O
in O
both O
teacher O

pupil O
conquered O
, O
and O
the O
fifth S-ORDINAL
time O
there O
was O
not O
a O
figure O
wrong O

and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
fondly O
putting O
back O
the O
heavy O
ringlets O

in O
Ellen's S-PERSON
absorbed O
attention O

fallen O

playfully O
— O
" O
Shall O
I O
tell O
you O
a O
secret O
, O
my O
little O
Ellen S-PERSON
? O
I O
was O
quite O
as O
disinclined O
to O
be O
firm O
this O
morning O
as O
you O
were O
to O
be O
patient O
| | O
so O
you O
see O
we O
have O
both O
gained O
a O
grand O
victory O
. O
My O
conjuring O
propensities O
, O
as O
Emmy S-PERSON
thinks O
them O
, O
told O
me O
that O
you O
had O
real O
cause O
for O
some O
little O
inattention O
, O
and O
, O
therefore O
that O
it O
was O
very O
cruel O
in O
me O
to O
be O
so O
determined O
| | O
but O
my O
judgment O
would O
tell O
me O
that O
my O
feeling O
was O
wrong O
, O
and O
that O
to O
conquer O
disinclination O
and O
overcome O
a O
difficulty O
, O
was O
a O
much O
better O
way O
of O
lessening O
even O
natural O
sorrow O
than O
to O
give O
up O
. O
I O
do O
not O
expect O
you O
to O
think O
so O
just O
now O
, O
but O
I O
fancy O
you O
are O
not O
very O
sorry O
this O
disagreeable O
, O
terribly O
tiresome O
sum O
has O
not O
to O
be O
done O
to O
- O
morrow O
, O
which O
it O
must O
have O
been O
, O
had O
you O
left O
it O
to O
- O
day O
. O
" O
Ellen S-PERSON
was O
so O
glad O
, O
that O
she O
felt O
almost O
happy O
, O
and O
her O
few O
other O
duties O
were O
done O
quite O
briskly O
, O
for O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
had O
been O
so O
kind O
as O
to O
countermand O
the O
carriage O
till O
one O
, O
that O
she O
and O
Caroline S-PERSON
might O
have O
time O
to O
finish O
. O
But O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
if O
she O
had O
not O
tried O
before O
, O
was O
now O
still O
less O
capable O
of O
doing O
so O
. O
Every O
word O
of O
kindness O
addressed O
to O
Ellen S-PERSON
increased O
the O
storm O
raging O
within O
, O
and O
the O
difficulty O
of O
restraining O
it O
in O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
presence O
caused O
it O
to O
burst O
forth O
with O
unmitigated O
violence O
the O
moment O
she O
quitted O
the O
apartment O
, O
desiring O
Emmeline S-PERSON
and O
Ellen S-PERSON
to O
make O
haste O
, O
and O
put O
away O
their O
books O
, O
but O
still O
without O
taking O
the O
least O
notice O
of O
her O
. O
Invective O
, O
reproach O
, O
almost O
abuse O
, O
were O
poured O
against O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
who O
stood O
actually O
frightened O
at O
the O
violence O
she O
had O
so O
very O
innocently O
excited O
, O
and O
at O
the O
fearful O
and O
deforming O
passion O
which O
inflamed O
her O
cousin's O
every O
feature O
. O
Caroline's S-PERSON
anger O
had O
miscounted O
time O
, O
or O
she O
must O
have O
known O
that O
her O
mother O
could O
not O
have O
gone O
far O
enough O
, O
for O
such O
unusual O
tones O
of O
excitement O
to O
escape O
her O
quick O
hearing O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
startled O
and O
alarmed O
, O
returned O
directly O
, O
and O
so O
vividly O
did O
her O
child's O
appearance O
and O
words O
recall O
her O
own O
misguided O
sister O
in O
those O
uncontrolled O
fits O
of O
fury O
, O
under O
which O
she O
had O
so O
often O
trembled O
, O
that O
present O
disappointment O
and O
dread O
for O
the O
future O
, O
took O
possession O
of O
her O
, O
and O
for O
the O
moment O
rendered O
her O
powerless O
. O
Caroline S-PERSON
was O
too O
much O
engrossed O
to O
perceive O
her O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
, O
and O
she O
had O
, O
therefore O
time O
to O
rally O
from O
the O
momentary O
weakness O
. O
" O
What O
does O
this O
mean O
? O
" O
she O
exclaimed O
, O
fixing O
her O
eyes O
on O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
with O
that O
expression O
of O
quiet O
but O
stern O
reproof O
, O
which O
when O
she O
did O
use O
it O
— O
and O
it O
was O
very O
seldom O
— O
had O
the O
power O
of O
subduing O
even O
the O
wildest O
excitement O
. O
" O
What O
has O
Ellen S-PERSON
done O
, O
that O
you O
should O
abuse O
her O
with O
this O
unjust O
and O
cruel O
and O
most O
unfeminine O
violence O
? O
You O
have O
indulged O
your O
ill O
- O
temper O
till O
you O
do O
not O
know O
what O
you O
say O
or O
do O
, O
and O
you O
are O
venting O
on O
another O
the O
anger O
which O
my O
displeasure O
has O
caused O
you O
to O
feel O
toward O
me O
and O
toward O
yourself O
. O
I O
desire O
that O
you O
will O
control O
it O
directly O
, O
or O
retire O
to O
your O
own O
room O
, O
till O
you O
can O
behave O
with O
some O
degree O
of O
propriety O
, O

not O
disturb O
the O
comfort O
and O
happiness O
of O
others O

this O
most O
uncalled O
- O
for O
manner O
. O
" O
" O
I O
will O
not O
go O

answered O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
bursting O
into O
violent O
tears O
, O
and O
scarcely O
aware O
of O
what O

was O
saying O
, O
" O

drive O

dear O
children O

Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
said O
, O
as O
she O
calmly O
turned O
for O
a O
moment O
to O
Emmeline S-PERSON
and O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
who O
both O
stood O
bewildered O
, O
the O
former O
from O
actual O
terror O
that O
her O
sister O
should O
dare O
so O
to O
address O
her O
mother O
, O
and O
the O
latter O
from O
pain O
at O
the O
violent O
avowal O
of O
a O
dislike O
which O
she O
had O
intuitively O
felt O
, O
but O
had O
always O
tried O
to O
disbelieve O
. O
" O
The O
beauty O
of O
the O
day O
will O
be O
gone O

we O
linger O
much O
longer O
, O
and O
I O
do O
not O
intend O

be O
disappointed O

our O
promised O
ramble O

not O

any O
thing O

what O
this O
unhappy O
girl O
is O
saying O

scarcely O
knows O
herself O

will O
by O
- O

- O
by O
wish O
it O
recalled O

far O
more O
intensely O
than O

" O
Emmeline S-PERSON
longed O
to O
throw O
her O
arms O
round O
her O
mother O
, O
and O
with O
tears O
beseech O
her O
to O
forget O
what O
Caroline S-PERSON
had O
said O

but O
, O
though O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
had O
spoken O
cheerfully O
, O
and O
in O
quite O
her O
usual O
tone O
of O
voice O
to O
them O
, O
there O
was O
something O
in O
her O
countenance O
, O
that O
checked O
any O
display O
of O
softness O
even O
in O
her O
affectionate O
child O

something O
that O
almost O
awed O
her O
, O
and O
she O
left O
the O
room O
with O
Ellen S-PERSON
to O
prepare O
for O
the O
promised O
excursion O
, O
which O
had O
, O
however O
, O
lost O
all O
its O
anticipated O
enjoyment O
from O
the O
uncontrolled O
temper O
of O
another O
. O
" O
Now O
, O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
I O
will O
answer O
you O

said O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
as O
soon O
as O
they O
were O
alone O
, O
and O
again O
regarding O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
sobbing O
violently O
, O
with O
that O
same O
searching O
look O

" O
Your O
charges O
are O
such O
very O
heavy O
ones O

you O
during O
my O
absence O

arrange O

define O
them O
in O
some O
order O

am O
so O
perfectly O

must O
inform O

exactly O

definitely O

what O
you O
complain O

That O
this O
morning O
my O
manner O
was O
kinder O

to O
you O

quite O
acknowledge O

inattention O

a O
cause O

none O

you O
were O
unhappy O

it O
was O
from O
your O
own O
fearful O
temper O

which O
by O
encouragement O
has O
blackened O
every O
thing O
around O
you O

You O
may O
employ O
your O
time O

dinner O
as O
you O
choose O

at O
five B-TIME

my O
dressing O

consider O
this O

Caroline S-PERSON

left O

in O
a O
very O
short O
time O

carriage O
drive O
off O

for O
nearly B-TIME
three I-TIME

remembered O

her O
so O
often O

it O
would O

been O
many B-DATE

its O
effects O

more O

its O
power O
over O

refused O
me O
, O
it O
would O
not O
have O
been O
half O
the O
pain O
I O
have O
made O
for O
myself O
. O
And O
how O
can O
I O
meet O
papa's O
eye O
and O
Percy's S-PERSON
unkind O
jokes O
with O
eyes O
like O
these O
? O
" O
she O
added O
, O
as O
on O
rising O
to O
go O
to O
her O
own O
room O
, O
she O
caught O
sight O
of O
her O
own O
face O
in O
a O
mirror O
, O
and O
actually O
started O
at O
the O
disfigurement O
which O
the O
violence O
of O
her O
emotion O
had O
wrought O
. O
" O
Oh O
, O
how O
I O
wish O
mamma O
had O
not O
desired O
me O
to O
go O
to O
her O

that O
I O
could O
but O
hide O
myself O
from O
every O
body O
— O
or O
get O
rid O
of O
this O
horrible O
black O
cloud O
. O
" O
From O
every O
eye O
but O
her O
mother's O
she O
could O
and O
did O
hide O
herself O
| | O
for O
saying O
that O
her O
head O
ached O
, O
which O
was O
the O
truth O
, O
and O
she O
did O
not O
wish O
any O
thing O
to O
take O
, O
she O
refused O
to O
go O
down O
to O
dinner O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
had O
successfully O
exerted O
herself O
during O
their O
excursion O
, O
and O
Emmeline S-PERSON
and O
Ellen S-PERSON
enjoyed O
themselves O
so O
thoroughly O
as O
almost O
to O
forget O
the O
alloy O
of O
the O
morning O
| | O
and O
even O
when O
Caroline's S-PERSON
message O
recalled O
it O
, O
the O
boys O
were O
all O
so O
merry O
, O
that O
it O
did O
not O
disturb O
them O
. O
Percy S-PERSON
always O
declared O
that O
Caroline's S-PERSON
headache O
was O
only O
another O
term O
for O
temper O
- O
ache O
, O
and O
he O
would O
certainly O
have O
sent O
her O
some O
message O
of O
mock O
pity O
, O
if O
his O
quick O
eye O
had O
not O
discovered O
or O
fancied O
that O
his O
mother O
did O
not O
look O
quite O
as O
well O
as O
usual O
, O
and O
so O
he O
contented O
himself O
by O
trying O
still O
more O
to O
be O
the O
life O
of O
the O
dinner O
- O
table O
. O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
had O
seen O
at O
a O
single O
glance O
that O
all O
was O
not O
quite O
right O
, O
and O
Caroline's S-PERSON
non-appearance O
and O
message O
explained O
it O
, O
to O
his O
extreme O
regret O
, O
for O
he O
had O
begun O
to O
hope O
and O
believe O
that O
his O
wife's O
extreme O
solicitude O
, O
on O
her O
account O
, O
was O
beginning O
to O
decrease O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
had O
not O
much O
doubt O
that O
silence O
and O
solitude O
had O
so O
far O
had O
effect O
on O
Caroline S-PERSON
as O
to O
subdue O
passion O
, O
and O
bring O
her O
to O
a O
sense O
of O
her O
misconduct O
| | O
but O
that O
had O
scarcely O
power O
to O
lessen O
the O
anxiety O
and O
the O
pain O
which O
Caroline's S-NORP
words O
had O
so O
wantonly O
inflicted O
. O
Had O
she O
indeed O
evinced O
any O
thing O
like O
undue O
partiality O
? O
the O
idea O
alone O
almost O
brought O
a O
smile O
| | O
fondly O
, O
and O
almost O
as O
her O
own O
child O
, O
as O
she O
loved O
her O
little O
niece O
. O
The O
very O
anxiety O
Caroline S-PERSON
occasioned O
her O
, O
deepened O
her O
affection O
| | O
the O
very O
control O
she O
was O
obliged O
to O
exercise O
in O
her O
mode O
of O
guiding O
her O
, O
strengthened O
every O
feeling O
toward O
her O
. O
She O
was O
so O
enwrapped O
in O
these O
painfully O
engrossing O
thoughts O
, O
in O
the O
strict O
examination O
of O
her O
own O
own O
heart O
, O
that O
she O
was O
not O
aware O
the O
time O
she O
had O
appointed O
had O
passed O
by O
full O
ten B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
, O
till O
she O
was O
roused O
by O
the O
handle O
of O
her O
door O
being O
softly O
turned O
, O
and O
left O
again O
, O
as O
if O
some O
one O
had O
wished O
to O
enter O
, O
but O
hesitated O
. O
The O
very O
hesitation O
gave O
her O
hope O
, O
for O
she O
really O
did O
not O
know O
that O
the O
utmost O
penalty O
she O
could O
have O
inflicted O
on O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
in O
the O
moment O
of O
natural O
indignation O
, O
would O
have O
failed O
in O
producing O
such O
an O
effect O
as O
the O
simple O
command O
to O
seek O
her O
, O
and O
define O
her O
charges O
against O
her O
, O
when O
that O
angry O
excitement O
had O
so O
calmed O
, O
that O
Caroline S-PERSON
would O
have O
given O
worlds O
, O
if O
she O
might O
but O
have O
not O
referred O
to O
it O
again O
. O
She O
knew O
she O
dared O
not O
disobey O
, O
but O
her O
daring O
had O
left O
her O
so O
powerless O
that O
she O
had O
stood O
at O
her O
mother's O
door O
full O
ten B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
before O
she O
could O
command O
courage O
sufficient O
to O
open O
it O
and O
enter O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
looked O
at O
her O
changed O
aspect O
, O
the O
bitter O
humiliation O
expressed O
in O
every O
feature O
, O
with O
such O
pity O
, O
that O
it O
required O
even O
more O
than O
her O
usual O
exercise O
of O
control O
, O
to O
retain O
the O
grave O
, O
and O
apparently O
unmoved O
tone O
with O
which O
she O
said O
— O
" O
You O
have O
had O
a O
long O
time O
in O
which O
to O
reflect O
on O
your O
charges O
against O
me O
, O
Caroline S-PERSON
. O
I O
hope O
they O
are O
now O
sufficiently O
defined O
for O
me O
to O
understand O
and O
answer O
them O
. O
You O
may O
sit O
down O
, O
for O
you O
do O
not O
seem O
very O
capable O
of O
standing O
. O
" O
Caroline S-PERSON
gladly O
obeyed O
, O
by O
sitting O
down O
on O
a O
low O
ottoman O
, O
some O
little O
distance O
from O
her O
mother O
, O
on O
whose O
neck O
she O
absolutely O
longed O
to O
throw O
herself O
and O
beseech O
forgiveness O
| | O
but O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
tone O
was O
not O
such O
as O
to O
give O
her O
courage O
to O
do O
so O
. O
She O
remained O
silent O
, O
burying O
her O
face O
in O
her O
hands O
. O
" O
I O
am O
waiting O
your O
pleasure O
, O
Caroline S-PERSON

I O
should O
have O
thought O
that O
you O
had O
had O
plenty O
of O
time O
to O
think O
during O
my O
absence O

Of O
what O
do O
you O
accuse O
me O

nothing O

nothing O

Caroline S-PERSON

were O
I O
to O
condemn O
you O
to O
any O
punishment O
, O
it O
would O
seem O
more O
like O
vengeance O
for O
the O
pain O
you O
have O
inflicted O
on O
me O
by O
your O
accusation O
of O
partiality O
and O
injustice O
, O
than O
from O
the O
hope O
of O
producing O
any O
good O
end O

You O
are O
no O
longer O
a O
child O
, O
who O
must O
be O
taught O
the O
line O
of O
duty O
to O
a O
parent O
. O
You O
know O
it O
now O
as O
well O
as O
I O
can O
teach O
it O
, O

if O

not O

you O
any O
further O

requesting O
you O
to O
explain O
clearly O
the O
origin O
of O
your O
complaint O
against O
me O

Its O
main O
ground O
of O
offense O
is O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
that O
since O
Ellen S-PERSON
has O
become O
an O
inmate O
of O
my O
family O
I O
have O
treated O
you O
with O
more O
harshness O
and O
unkindness O
than O
I O
ever O
did O
before O
. O
Can O
you O
look O
back O
on O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
eighteen I-DATE
months E-DATE

recall O
one S-CARDINAL
instance O
in O
which O
this O
has O
been O
the O
case O
? O
I O
must O
have O
an O
answer O
, O
Caroline S-PERSON

you O
may O
now O
think O
explanation O
is O
not O
necessary O
, O
and O
that O
you O
meant O
nothing O
when O
you O
spoke O

that O
will O
not O
satisfy O
me O
nor O
you O
, O
when O
ill O
- O
temper O
regains O
ascendency O
. O
You O
need O
not O
refrain O
from O
answering O
for O
fear O
of O
wounding O
me O

You O
can O
scarcely O
do O
that O
more O
than O
you O
have O
done O
already O

" O
Caroline S-PERSON
tried O
to O
speak O
, O
but O
she O
could O
only O
sob O
forth O
, O
that O
she O
could O
not O
recall O
one S-CARDINAL
instance O

her O
mother O

almost O
inarticulately O
, O
that O

from O
your O
earliest O
infancy O

most O
tender O

devoted O
care O

out O

all O

returning O
temper O

" O

Caroline S-PERSON
turned O
from O

penetrating O
look O

burst O
into O
tears O

Few O
as O
the O
words O
were O

seemed O
to O
flash O
light O
into O
the O
very O
inmost O
recesses O
of O
her O
heart O

moments O
of O
uncontrolled O
temper O

in O
her O
brooding O
fancies O

she O
really O
did O
forfeit O
the O
truth O

on O
adherence O
to O
which O
she O
so O
prided O
herself O

that O
there O
was O
no O
excuse O

Caroline S-PERSON
hesitated O

resolved O

atone O
for O
her O
fault O
at O

by O
a O
full O
confession O

She O
told O
all O
the O
wishes O

the O
hopes O
Annie's S-PERSON
information O
of O
Lady O
Helen's S-PERSON
promise O
had O
imparted O
, O

the O
pain O
it O
was O
to O
feel O
that O
her O
mother O
thought O
her O
such O
a O
child O

not O
to O
speak O
to O
her O
on O
the O
subject O

" O
And O
if O
you O
did O
think O
so O
, O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
why O
did O
you O
not O
from O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
moment O
that O
Annie S-PERSON
told O
you O
of O
it O
, O
come O
to O
me O
, O
and O
tell O
me O
how O
very O
much O
you O
wished O
it O
? O
I O
could O
not O
, O
indeed O
, O
have O
granted O
your O
wishes O

but O
your O
confidence O
would O
have O
been O
met O
with O
such O
indulgence O
as O
would O
at O

have O
saved O
you O
some O
degree O
of O
pain O

Believing O
, O
as O
I O
did O
, O

as O
Lady B-PERSON

assured O
me O
I O
might O
with O
safety O
, O
that O

nothing O

I O
said O

I O
grant O
that O
I O
have O
not O
treated O
you O

in O
this O
instance O
, O
with O
the O
consideration O
that O
your O
age O
might O
perhaps O
have O
demanded O

from O
Annie S-PERSON
not O
obeying O
Lady O

desire O
, O
that O

sparing O
you O

disappointment O

had O
hoped O

another O

over O
that O

seems O

accuse O
me O

Caroline S-PERSON
looked O
hastily O
up O

tone O

almost O
as O
fond O
as O
usual O
, O

, O
unable O
to O
restrain O
the O
impulse O
any O
longer O

she O
started O
from O
her O
low O
seat O

kneeling O
down O
close O
by O
her O
, O
clung O
round O
her O

passionately O
exclaiming O
— O

not O
refusing O
the O
kiss O

earnestly O

from O

salutary O
pain O

Caroline S-PERSON

would O
gladly O
have O
flown O

worked O
with O
double O
assiduity O

by O

for O
her O
fault O

instead O
of O
merely O
shrinking O

was O
a O
trial O
to O
join O
her O
family O
even O
for O
prayers O

for O
she O
felt O
so O
self O

convicted O

so O
humbled O
, O
that O
she O
fancied O
every O
one O
must O
despise O
her O

and O
when O
, O
after O
the O
service O
, O
Percy S-PERSON
approached O
, O
and O
, O
with O
mock O
sympathy O
, O
inquired O
how O
her O
headache O
was O
, O
and O
if O
she O
had O
recovered O
her O
appetite O
, O
and O
begged O
her O
not O
to O
be O
ill O
at O
such O
a O
critical O
time O
, O
as O
he O
most O
particularly O
wished O
to O
go O
to O
Lady B-PERSON
Helen's E-PERSON
ball O
, O
and O
he O
could O
not O
be O
so O
cruel O
, O
if O
she O
were O
not O
well O
, O
her O
spirit O
was O
so O
broken O
that O
the O
large O
tears O
rolled O
down O
her O
cheeks O
, O
and O
she O
turned O
away O
without O
uttering O
a O
single O
word O
. O
" O
If O
you O
had O
taken O
the O
trouble O
to O
look O
in O
your O
sister's O
face O
, O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
you O
would O
not O
have O
spoken O
so O
unkindly O
, O
" O
said O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
more O
hastily O
than O
she O
was O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
interfering O
| | O
and O
as O
Caroline S-PERSON
came O
to O
her O
, O
she O
whispered O
some O
few O
fond O
words O
, O
that O
enabled O
her O
to O
wish O
her O
father O
good O
- O
night O
and O
leave O
the O
room O
, O
without O
any O
farther O
display O
of O
emotion O
. O
" O
Do O
you O
wish O
your O
sister O
to O
dislike O
you O
, O
Percy S-PERSON
? O
" O
she O
said O
gently O
detaining O
him O
, O
as O
he O
was O
following O
Caroline S-PERSON
. O
" O
Dislike O
me O
, O
mother O
? O
No O
! O
how O
can O
you O
think O
so O
? O
" O
" O
Because O
you O
act O
as O
if O
you O
wished O
it O

you O
never O
see O
her O
uncomfortable O
, O
without O
trying O
to O
make O
her O
more O
so O
, O
and O
is O
that O
kind O
? O
How O
can O
she O
ever O
look O
up O
to O
and O
love O
you O
, O
while O
such O
is O
the O
case O
? O
" O
" O
I O
only O
mean O
it O
for O
fun O
, O
mother O
. O
It O
is O
such O
glorious O
enjoyment O
to O
me O
to O
torment O
, O
when O
I O
see O
people O
cross O
and O
miserable O
for O
nothing O

" O
" O
And O
in O
the O
enjoyment O
of O
your O
fun O
, O
my O
dear O
boy O
, O
you O
forget O
other O
people's O
feelings O
. O
I O
must O
beg O
you O
as O
an O
especial O
favor O
to O
myself O
, O
that O
you O
will O
do O
all O
you O
can O
to O
soothe O
rather O
than O
irritate O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
in O
the O
short O
time O
that O
intervenes O
before O
you O
go O
to O
London S-GPE
. O
She O
will O
have O
a O
hard O
struggle O
with O
herself O
, O
so O
do O
not O
you O
make O
her O
trial O
more O
difficult O
. O
" O
" O
Do O
you O
wish O
it O
, O
mother O
, O
dear O
? O
you O
know O
I O
would O
refrain O
from O
teasing O
even O
for O
a O
whole O
year O
, O
if O
it O
would O
please O
you O

give O
me O
the O
privilege O
of O
a O
kiss O
whenever O
I O
like O
, O
" O
he O
laughingly O
answered O
, O
looking O
up O
in O
her O
face O
so O
archly O
and O
yet O
so O
fondly O
, O
that O
his O
mother O
could O
not O
help O
smiling O

promising O
she O
would O
not O
sentence O
him O
to O
any O
thing O
so O
terrible O
as O
not O
to O
tease O
for O
a O
whole O
year O
, O
as O
she O
was O
quite O
sure O
he O
would O
fall O
into O
his O
old O
propensities O
before O
a O
quarter O

Lady O
Helen's S-PERSON
ball O
took O
place O

and O
Caroline S-PERSON
had O
so O
conquered O
herself O
, O
that O
she O
could O
listen O
to O
Percy's S-PERSON
flowing O
account O
of O
its O
delights O
with O
actual O
cheerfulness O
. O
It O
was O
so O
associated O
with O
self O
- O
reproach O
, O
that O
she O
could O
scarcely O
think O
of O
it O
without O
pain O
| | O
but O
she O
was O
so O
convinced O
of O
her O
folly O
in O
permitting O
such O
a O
very O
little O
thing O
so O
to O
affect O
her O
temper O
as O
to O
cause O
all O
the O
misery O
she O
had O
endured O
, O
that O
she O
had O
resolved O
to O
punish O
herself O
, O
not O
only O
by O
listening O
to O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
but O
by O
herself O
inquiring O
the O
details O
. O
She O
was O
a O
girl O
of O
really O
a O
strong O
mind O
, O
and O
once O
convinced O
of O
error O
, O
once O
released O
from O
the O
fell O
dominion O
of O
temper O
, O
she O
did O
not O
care O
what O
pain O
she O
endured O
, O
or O
what O
difficulty O
she O
encountered O
, O
so O
that O
she O
could O
but O
convince O
her O
mother O
how O
truly O
she O
regretted O
, O
and O
tried O
to O
atone O
for O
past O
misconduct O
. O
It O
was O
very O
easy O
, O
as O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
had O
told O
her O
, O
to O
regain O
lost O
time O
in O
her O
studies O
, O
but O
not O
quite O
so O
easy O
to O
check O
the O
cross O
word O
or O
unkind O
thought O
, O
and O
to O
break O
from O
the O
black O
cloud O
that O
still O
at O
times O
would O
envelop O
her O
. O
But O
she O
did O
not O
give O
way O
, O
constantly O
even O
making O
opportunities O
for O
self O
- O
denial O
, O
and O
doing O
little O
kindnesses O
for O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
though O
she O
was O
too O
truthful O
to O
profess O
an O
affection O
which O
as O
yet O
she O
could O
not O
feel O
. O
Early O
in O
the B-DATE
following I-DATE
week E-DATE
Mr. O
Grahame S-PERSON
came O
over O
to O
Oakwood S-GPE
with O
a O
petition O
. O
Annie S-PERSON
having O
taken O
cold O
at O
the O
party O
, O
had O
been O
obliged O
to O
enact O
the O
invalid O
, O
much O
against O
her O
inclination O
, O
and O
so O
entreated O
her O
mother O
to O
invite O
Caroline S-PERSON
to O
spend O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
days E-DATE
with O
her O
| | O
and O
to O
her O
astonishment O
, O
her O
cold O
, O
harsh O
father O
volunteered O
to O
go O
himself O
for O
her O
. O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
at O
once O
acceded O
| | O
his O
wife O
hesitated O
| | O
but O
she O
went O
at O
once O
to O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
who O
chanced O
to O
be O
reading O
alone O
in O
the O
school O
- O
room O
, O
for O
it O
was O
the O
time O
of O
recreation O
, O
and O
told O
her O
. O
For O
a O
moment O
her O
countenance O
was O
actually O
radiant O
with O
delight O
, O
the O
next O
it O
clouded O
over O
. O
" O
You O
would O
like O
it O
very O
much O
, O
but O
you O
are O
afraid O
I O
shall O
not O
permit O
you O
to O
go O
— O
is O
that O
the O
meaning O
of O
your O
change O
of O
countenance O
? O
" O
asked O
her O
mother O
, O
half S-CARDINAL
smiling O
. O
" O
I O
am O
afraid O
of O
myself O
, O
mamma O
| | O
for O
I O
fear O
I O
am O
always O
more O
ill O
- O
tempered O
and O
proud O
after O
any O
such O
pleasure O
as O
going O
to O
Moorlands S-LOC
would O
be O
. O
" O
" O
Would O
you O
rather O
not O
go O
, O
then O
? O
" O
" O
I O
can O
not O
say O
quite O
that O
, O
mamma O
| | O
I O
should O
like O
it O
very O
much O
, O
if O
I O
could O
but O
be O
sure O
of O
myself O
afterward O
. O
" O
" O
Did O
you O
ever O
feel O
such O
a O
doubt O
of O
yourself O
before O
, O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
when O
going O
to O
stay O
with O
Annie S-PERSON
? O
" O
" O
No O
, O
mamma O
| | O
I O
seem O
to O
have O
thought O
a O
great O
deal O
more O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
few I-DATE
days E-DATE
, O
and O
not O
to O
feel O
half O
so O
sure O
of O
myself O
. O
" O
" O
Then O
I O
think O
there O
is O
less O
danger O
for O
you O
, O
that O
is O
, O
of O
course O
, O
if O
you O
are O
willing O
to O
risk O
the O
temptation O
of O
Lady O
Helen's O
too O
kind O
consideration O
and O
lavish O
praises O
, O
which O
make O
mine O
so O
very O
tame O

" O
" O
Oh O
, O
mamma O
, O
pray O
do O
not O
say O
so O
, O
" O
interrupted O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
very O
eagerly O
. O
" O
Indeed O
, O
I O
would O
rather O
hear O
you O
speak O
and O
see O
you O
smile O
as O
you O
do O
now O
, O
than O
listen O
to O
all O
that O
Lady O
Helen S-PERSON
is O
so O
kind O
as O
to O
say O

I O
know O
I O
did O
like O
it O
very O
much O
, O

that O
it O
did O
sometimes O
make O
me O
fancy O
when O
I O
came O
home O
, O
that O
you O
were O
almost O
cold O
. O
But O
, O
indeed O
, O
indeed O
, O
I O
hope O
I O
am O
learning O

you O
better O

I O
hope O
so O

too O

Mr. O

waiting O
for O
you O

by O

you O
for O
some O
lines O

copy O
out O
for O
a O
print O
in O
Lady B-WORK_OF_ART
Helen's E-WORK_OF_ART
album O
. O
You O
may O
do O
just O
as O
you O
like O
about O
going O
, O
because O
you O
are O
quite O
old O
and O
wise O
enough O
to O
decide O
for O
yourself O

Ill O

temper O
always O
brings O
such O
suffering O
with O
it O
, O
that O
if O
pleasure O
must O
recall O
it O
, O
you O
will O
be O
wiser O
not O

go O

if O
you O

resist O
it O

answered O
Caroline S-PERSON

in O
a O
very O
earnest O

somewhat O
lowered O
voice O

against O

" O
With O
the O
most O
delighted O
alacrity O
Caroline S-PERSON
hastened O
to O
get O
ready O
, O
and O
in O
her O
hurry O
forgot O
the O
poem O
till O
she O
re-entered O
the O
school O
- O
room O
, O
which O
was O
still O
untenanted O

" O
What O
shall O
I O
do O
for O
some O
writing O
- O
paper O
? O
" O
she O
thought O

" O
the O
desks O
are O
all O
put O
away O
, O
and O
it O
will O
detain O
me O
so O
long O
to O
go O
up O
again O
for O
the O
keys O
, O
and O
the O
volume O
is O
too O
large O
to O
carry O
— O
oh O
, O
I O
will O
tear O
out O
a O
blank O
page O
from O
this O
book O
, O
it O
will O
not O
be O
very O
elegant O
, O
but O
I O
can O
recopy O
it O
at O
Moorlands S-LOC
. O
" O
And O
she O
hastily O
tore O
out O
a O
page O
from O
an O
exercise O
- O
book O
which O
lay O
open O
on O
the O
table O
| | O
not O
perceiving O
that O
by O
doing O
so O
, O
a O
fellow O
- O
leaf O
, O
which O
was O
written O
on O
, O
was O
loosened O
, O
and O
fell O
to O
the O
ground O
, O
mingling O
with O
some O
torn O
papers O
which O
had O
been O
put O
in O
a O
heap O
to O
be O
cleared O
away O
. O
She O
had O
just O
finished O
it O
, O
when O
Fanny S-PERSON
came O
to O
tell O
her O
Mr. O
Grahame S-PERSON
could O
not O
wait O
any O
longer O
, O
and O
asking O
if O
all O
the O
papers O
on O
the O
ground O
were O
to O
be O
removed O
, O
Caroline S-PERSON
hastily O
answered O
in O
the O
affirmative O
, O
without O
looking O
at O
them O
, O
and O
the O
girl O
bore O
them O
off O
in O
her O
apron O
, O
the O
written O
leaf O
among O
them O
. O
Now O
it O
so O
happened O
that O
this O
written O
leaf O
had O
already O
occasioned O
trouble O
. O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
had O
been O
so O
displeased O
with O
Ellen's S-PERSON
careless O
performance O
of O
a O
French S-NORP
exercise O
that O
morning O
, O
that O
she O
had O
desired O
her O
to O
write O
it O
again O
. O
It O
was O
very O
difficult O
, O
and O
had O
materially O
shortened O
the O
time O
which O
she O
had O
promised O
to O
devote O
to O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
this B-DATE
week E-DATE
released O
from O
his O
attendance O
on O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
, O
to O
permit O
him O
and O
Ellen S-PERSON
to O
be O
as O
much O
together O
as O
possible O
. O
Hurried O
by O
him O
, O
she O
left O
her O
book O
open O
on O
the O
table O
to O
dry O
, O
and O
, O
finding O
it O
closed O
on O
her O
return O
, O
put O
it O
away O
, O
without O
looking O
at O
it O
. O
The O
following O
day O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
, O
of O
course O
, O
requested O
to O
see O
it O
, O
and O
, O
to O
Ellen's S-PERSON
utter O
astonishment O
, O
her O
exercise O
was O
not O
there O
| | O
only O
the O
faulty O
and O
blotted O
theme O
, O
with O
no O
sign O
to O
explain O
its O
disappearance O
. O
Now O
we O
know O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
was O
rather O
prejudiced O
against O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
and O
, O
as O
she O
had O
unhappily O
failed O
in O
truth O
more O
than O
once O
( O
perhaps O
she O
was O
not O
so O
unjust O
and O
harsh O
as O
poor O
Ellen S-PERSON
felt O
her O
to O
be O
) O
, O
she O
refused O
to O
believe O
her O
assurance O
that O
she O
had O
written O
it O
. O
No O
one O
had O
been O
in O
the O
school O
- O
room O
at O
the O
time O
to O
whom O
she O
could O
refer O
: O
if O
Ellen S-PERSON
had O
never O
disobeyed O
or O
deceived O
, O
of O
course O
her O
word O
would O
be O
sufficient O
, O
as O
her O
brother's O
and O
cousins' O
would O
. O
" O
That O
you O
have O
failed O
again O
, O
both O
in O
obedience O
and O
truth O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
I O
can O
not O
for O
a O
moment O
doubt O
, O
and O
it O
certainly O
would O
be O
my O
duty O
to O
inform O
your O
aunt O
directly O
| | O
but O
as O
I O
know O
it O
would O
cause O
her O
real O
suffering O
to O
be O
compelled O
to O
punish O
you O
just O
this O
last O
week O
that O
Edward S-PERSON
will O
be O
with O
us O
for O
some O
time O
, O
I O
shall O
say O
nothing O
about O
it O
to O
her O
, O
nor O
inflict O
any O
penalty O
on O
you O
to O
attract O
her O
notice O
, O
but O
it O
is O
entirely O
for O
her O
sake O
I O
forbear O
. O
One S-CARDINAL
so O
hardened O
in O
falsehood O
as O
you O
must O
be O
, O
so O
soon O
to O
forget O
her O
kind O
indulgence O
after O
your O
fault O
only B-DATE
a I-DATE
few I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
ago E-DATE
, O
can O
deserve O
nothing O
but O
harshness O
and O
contempt O
. O
I O
shall O
certainly O
, O
after O
this B-DATE
week E-DATE
, O
warn O
her O
not O
to O
trust O
too O
implicitly O
in O
your O
artful O
professions O
of O
repentance O
. O
" O
Poor O
Ellen S-PERSON
felt O
too O
bewildered O
and O
too O
miserable O
even O
to O
cry O
. O
That O
she O
had O
written O
her O
exercise O
, O
she O
was O
as O
positive O
as O
that O
she O
had O
been O
told O
to O
do O
so O
| | O
but O
if O
she O
had O
— O
what O
had O
become O
of O
it O
? O
Harsh O
as O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
seemed O
, O
appearances O
were O
certainly O
very O
much O
against O
her O
. O
She O
had O
not O
a O
single O
proof O
that O
she O
had O
obeyed O
, O
and O
her O
word O
was O
nothing O
| | O
even O
Emmeline S-PERSON
looked O
at O
her O
doubtingly O
, O
and O
as O
if O
she O
could O
scarcely O
even O
pity O
her O
. O
It O
was O
very O
little O
comfort O
to O
think O
her O
aunt O
was O
not O
to O
be O
told O
. O
Her O
own O
impulse O
was O
to O
go O
to O
her O
, O
and O
tell O
her O
at O
once O
| | O
but O
how O
could O
she O
be O
believed O
? O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
words O
— O
" O
If O
I O
ever O
discover O
another O
untruth O
, O
you O
will O
compel O
me O
to O
adopt O
still O
severer O
measures O
, O
pain O
as O
it O
will O
be O
to O
myself O
, O
" O
the O
remembrance O
of O
all O
she O
had O
suffered O
, O
the O
disappointment O
it O
would O
be O
to O
her O
aunt O
to O
think O
all O
she O
had O
said O
and O
read O
to O
her O
were O
forgotten O
, O
when O
in O
reality O
she O
was O
constantly O
thinking O
of O
and O
trying O
to O
act O
on O
them O
, O
all O
checked O
the O
impulse O
, O
and O
terrified O
her O
into O
silence O
. O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
was O
not O
an O
acute O
physiognomist O
| | O
she O
could O
only O
read O
in O
Ellen's S-PERSON
face O
hardihood O
and O
recklessness O
. O
We O
rather O
think O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
would O
have O
read O
something O
very O
different O
| | O
but O
she O
was O
very O
much O
engaged O
with O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
and O
if O
she O
did O
think O
Ellen S-PERSON
looked O
much O
more O
out O
of O
spirits O
, O
she O
attributed O
it O
to O
natural O
feeling O
at O
the O
rapid O
approach O
of O
the O
day O
of O
separation O
. O
For O
her O
brother's O
sake O
, O
to O
prove O
to O
him O
she O
could O
enter O
into O
his O
joy O
, O
she O
tried O
very O
hard O
not O
to O
evince O
the O
least O
symptom O
of O
depression O
, O
and O
never O
to O
cry O
before O
him O
at O
least O
| | O
though O
every O
night O
, O
that O
told O
her O
another O
day O
had O
gone O
, O
and O
brought O
before O
her O
all O
sorts O
of O
vague O
feelings O
and O
fancies O
of O
dread O
, O
she O
either O
cried O
herself O
to O
sleep O
, O
or O
laid O
awake O
, O
still O
more O
unhappy O
. O
The O
suspicion O
attached O
to O
her O
seemed O
to O
double O
the O
severity O
of O
the O
trial O
of O
parting O
. O
Edward S-PERSON
was O
her O
own O
| | O
Edward S-PERSON
must O
love O
her O
, O
with O
all O
her O
faults O
| | O
but O
even O
her O
aunt O
, O
her O
kind O
, O
dear O
, O
good O
aunt O
, O
must O
cease O
to O
have O
any O
affection O
for O
her O
, O
if O
so O
constantly O
believed O
guilty O
of O
a O
sin O
so O
terrible O
as O
falsehood O
. O
And O
she O
seemed O
to O
love O
her O
brother O
still O
more O
than O
ever O
, O
every O
day O
that O
brought O
the O
hour O
of O
parting O
nearer O
— O
sometimes O
as O
if O
she O
could O
not O
bear O
the O
pain O
of O
not O
being O
able O
to O
look O
at O
his O
bright O
face O
, O
and O
listen O
to O
his O
glad O
laugh O
and O
dear O
voice O
for O
three S-CARDINAL
, O
perhaps O
six B-DATE
long I-DATE
years E-DATE
. O
Her O
aunt's O
gentle O
kindness O
seemed O
to O
increase O
her O
unhappiness O
, O
for O
though O
she O
knew O
she O
was O
innocent O
, O
still O
she O
felt O
, O
if O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
had O
told O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
she O
could O
not O
be O
so O
caressed O
and O
cared O
for O
and O
she O
was O
receiving O
that O
which O
she O
was O
believed O
to O
have O
forfeited O
. O
Miss O
Harcourt's S-PERSON
face O
certainly O
seemed O
to O
ask O
her O
as O
distinctly O
as O
words O
, O
how O
she O
could O
be O
so O
artful O
— O
so O
deceitful O
— O
as O
to O
permit O
her O
aunt O
to O
take O
such O
notice O
of O
her O
| | O
and O
so O
she O
often O
shrunk O
away O
, O
when O
she O
most O
longed O
to O
sit O
by O
and O
listen O
to O
her O
. O
Edward's S-PERSON
spirits O
never O
sobered O
, O
except O
now O
and O
then O
, O
when O
he O
thought O
of O
leaving O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
to O
whom O
he O
had O
given O
the O
same O
love O
he O
had O
lavished O
on O
his O
mother O
, O
perhaps O
to O
a O
still O
greater O
extent O
, O
for O
reverence O
was O
largely O
mingled O
with O
it O
. O
Mr O
Howard S-PERSON
, O
too O
, O
was O
another O
whom O
he O
grieved O
to O
leave O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
so O
trusted O
in O
these O
apparently O
strong O
affections O
and O
his O
good O
disposition O
, O
as O
to O
feel O
but O
little O
anxiety O

merely O
sorrow O
that O
she O
was O
to O
lose O
him O
for O
a O
profession O
of O
danger O
. O
She O
did O
not O
know O
, O
nor O
did O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
, O
nor O
Edward S-PERSON
himself O
, O
that O
he O
was O
one O

would O
be O
guided O
more O
by O
the O
influence O
of O

bringing O
Caroline S-PERSON
home O
with O
them O

Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
, O
and O
some O
of O
Edward's S-PERSON
favorite O
companions O
, O
all O
assembled O
at O
Oakwood S-ORG
, O
and O
every O
one O
was O
determined O
to O
be O
gay O
and O
cheerful O
, O
and O
Edward's S-PERSON
voice O
was O
the O
merriest O
, O
and O
his O
laugh O
the O
happiest O
there O

and O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
though O
her O
head O
ached O
with O
the O
effort O
, O
and O
the O
constant O
struggle O
of O
the B-DATE
preceding I-DATE
week E-DATE
, O
was O
quite O
cheerful O
too O
, O
and O
talked O
to O
Mary B-PERSON
Greville E-PERSON
, O
and O
Lilla S-PERSON
and O
Cecil B-PERSON
Grahame E-PERSON
, O
and O
even O
to O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
, O
as O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
felt O
she O
had O
no O
right O
to O
do O
| | O
and O
as O
must O
prove O
her O
to O
be O
that O
which O
she O
had O
always O
fancied O
her O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
saw O
that O
in O
the O
very O
midst O
of O
a O
laugh O
, O
or O
of O
speaking O
, O
her O
niece's O
eye O
would O
rest O
upon O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
and O
the O
lip O
quite O
quiver O
, O
and O
her O
smile O
become O
for O
the O
moment O
so O
strained O
, O
that O
she O
was O
satisfied O
Ellen's S-PERSON
cheerfulness O
proceeded O
from O
no O
want O
of O
feeling O
| | O
she O
wondered O
, O
indeed O
, O
at O
so O
much O
control O
at O
such O
an O
early O
age O
, O
but O
she O
loved O
her O
for O
it O
, O
notwithstanding O
. O
Once O
only O
Ellen S-PERSON
was O
nearly O
conquered O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
had O
begged O
her O
to O
sing O
a O
little O
Hindoo S-NORP
air O
, O
of O
which O
she O
was O
particularly O
fond O
, O
and O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
hearing O
the O
request O
, O
said O
eagerly O
— O
" O
Do O
sing O
it O
, O
dear O
Ellen S-PERSON
| | O
I O
am O
quite O
as O
fond O
of O
it O
as O
Mary S-PERSON
is O
, O
for O
it O
seems O
to O
make O
me O
think O
of O
India S-GPE
and O
poor O
mamma O
, O
and O
it O
will O
be O
such O
a O
long O
time O
before O
I O
hear O
it O
again O
. O
" O
She O
had O
never O
in O
her O
whole O
life O
felt O
so O
disinclined O
to O
sing O
, O
so O
as O
if O
it O
were O
quite O
impossible O
— O
as O
if O
she O
must O
cry O
if O
she O
did O
| | O
but O
Edward S-PERSON
would O
think O
it O
so O
unkind O
if O
she O
refused O
, O
for O
she O
did O
not O
know O
herself O
why O
his O
very O
words O
should O
have O
increased O
the O
difficulty O
, O
and O
what O
reason O
could O
she O
give O
him O
? O
Mary S-PERSON
went O
and O
asked O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
to O
accompany O
her O
| | O
and O
Ellen S-PERSON
did O
her O
very O
best O
, O
but O
her O
voice O
would O
tremble O
, O
and O
just O
before O
the O
end O
of O
the O
second S-ORDINAL
verse O
it O
failed O
entirely O
| | O
but O
still O
she O
was O
glad O
she O
had O
tried O
, O
for O
on O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
saying O
, O
very O
kindly O
, O
and O
in O
a O
voice O
that O
only O
she O
and O
Mary S-PERSON
could O
hear O
, O
" O
I O
was O
half O
afraid O
you O
would O
not O
succeed O
to O
- O
night O
, O
my O
dear O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
but O
you O
were O
quite O
right O
to O
try O
, O
" O
Mary S-PERSON
seemed O
to O
understand O
at O
once O
why O
it O
had O
been O
so O
difficult O
for O
her O
to O
oblige O
her O
, O
and O
to O
be O
quite O
sorry O
she O
had O
pressed O
it O
so O
much O
, O
and O
Edward S-PERSON
had O
thanked O
her O
, O
and O
told O
her O
he O
should O
sing O
it O
in O
idea O
very O
often O
. O
She O
tried O
to O
be O
merry O
again O
, O
but O
she O
could O
not O
succeed O
as O
before O
, O
and O
so O
she O
kept O
as O
near O
her O
aunt O
as O
she O
could O
, O
all O
the O
remainder O
of O
the O
evening O
, O
as O
if O
she O
were O
only O
safe O
there O
. O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
too O
, O
had O
a O
hard O
battle O
with O
himself O
, O
as O
one S-CARDINAL
by O
one O
his O
favorite O
companions O
took O
leave O
of O
him O
with O
a O
hearty O
shake O
of O
the O
hand O
, O
and O
eager O
— O
but O
in O
some O
, O
half S-CARDINAL
- O
choked O
wishes O
for O
his O
health O
and O
prosperity O
| | O
and O
when O
all O
had O
gone O
, O
and O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
remained O
for O
prayers O
, O
took O
him O
in O
his O
arms O
, O
and O
solemnly O
prayed O
God O
to O
bless O
him O
, O
and O
save O
him O
from O
danger O
and O
temptation O
, O
and O
permit O
him O
to O
return O
to O
his O
family O
, O
improved O
in O
all O
things O
that O
would O
make O
him O
an O
affectionate O
guardian O
to O
his O
orphan O
sister O
, O
and O
repay O
all O
the O
love O
and O
care O
of O
his O
aunt O
and O
uncle O
, O
it O
was O
a O
desperate O
effort O
that O
prevented O
him O
from O
sobbing O
like O
a O
child O
| | O
but O
he O
had O
his O
midshipman's O
uniform O
on O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
, O
and O
he O
was O
quite O
resolved O
he O
would O
not O
disgrace O
it O
| | O
therefore O
he O
only O
returned O
Mr. O
Howard's S-PERSON
embrace O
very O
warmly O
, O
and O
ran O
out O
of O
the O
room O
. O
But O
when O
his O
aunt O
went O
into O
his O
room O
an B-TIME
hour E-TIME
afterward O
, O
it O
appeared O
as O
if O
he O
had O
put O
off O
his O
pride O
and O
his O
uniform O
together O
, O
for O
, O
though O
he O
was O
fast O
asleep O
, O
his O
pillow O
was O
quite O
wet O
with O
tears O
. O
The O
next O
morning O
was O
a O
very O
sad O
one O
, O
though O
Percy S-PERSON
and O
his O
father O
did O
all O
they O
could O
to O
make O
it O
cheerful O
( O
we O
ought O
to O
have O
said O
before O
that O
Percy S-PERSON
and O
Herbert S-PERSON
were O
both O
going O
with O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
and O
Edward S-PERSON
) O
. O
No O
one O
liked O
the O
idea O
of O
losing O
Edward S-PERSON
for O
so O
long O
a O
time O
. O
He O
had O
made O
himself O
a O
favorite O
with O
all O
, O
even O
with O
every O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
servants O
, O
who O
, O
when O
the O
carriage O
was O
ready O
at O
eleven B-TIME
o'clock E-TIME
, O
thronged O
into O
the O
hall O
to O
take O
a O
last O
look O
at O
him O
. O
He O
was O
so O
altered O
, O
that O
he O
had O
that O
morning O
, O
actually O
of O
his O
own O
accord O
, O
shaken O
hands O
with O
every O
one O
of O
them O
who O
had O
ever O
done O
any O
thing O
for O
him O
, O
especially O
Ellis S-PERSON
and O
Morris S-PERSON
, O
and O
Robert S-PERSON
, O
to O
whom O
he O
had O
given O
a O
very O
handsome O
present O
, O
and O
thanked O
him O
for O
all O
his O
attention O
. O
He O
kept O
up O
very O
manfully O
till O
he O
came O
to O
his O
aunt O
, O
whose O
emotion O
, O
as O
she O
held O
him O
in O
a O
close O
embrace O
, O
was O
so O
unusually O
visible O
, O
and O
for O
the O
moment O
he O
seemed O
so O
to O
love O
her O
, O
that O
the O
idea O
of O
the O
sea O
lost O
half O
its O
delight O
, O
and O
he O
felt O
as O
if O
he O
could O
almost O
have O
liked O
to O
remain O
with O
her O
. O
But O
Percy's S-PERSON
joyous O
voice O
— O
" O
Come B-WORK_OF_ART
, I-WORK_OF_ART
Master I-WORK_OF_ART
Edward E-WORK_OF_ART
, O
I O
thought O
you O
were O
a O
sailor O
, O
not O
a O
school O
- O
boy O
. O
Off O
with O
you O
| | O
you O
will O
not O
give O
me O
time O
or O
room O
for O
one S-CARDINAL
kiss O
from O
mamma O
before O
we O
go O
, O
" O
roused O
him O
, O
and O
he O
tried O
to O
laugh O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
his O
tears O
, O
gave O
Ellen S-PERSON
another O
kiss O
, O
and O
ran O
into O
the O
carriage O
, O
where O
he O
was O
quickly O
followed O
by O
his O
uncle O
and O
cousins O
, O
and O
in O
a O
very O
few O
minutes O
Oakwood O
, O
dear O
, O
happy O
Oakwood S-PERSON
, O
as O
his O
whole O
heart O
felt O
it O
at O
that O
moment O
, O
was O
hidden O
from O
his O
sight O
. O
Ellen S-PERSON
remained O
by O
the O
window O
, O
looking O
after O
the O
carriage O
, O
long O
after O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
see O
or O
hear O
it O
, O
very O
pale O
, O
and O
her O
eyes O
very O
heavy O
, O
but O
not O
in O
tears O
| | O
and O
as O
her O
aunt O
went O
to O
her O
, O
and O
put O
her O
arm O
round O
her O
, O
and O
began O
talking O
to O
her O
very O
cheerfully O
of O
all O
Edward S-PERSON
would O
have O
to O
write O
to O
her O
about O
, O
and O
how O
soon O
they O
might O
hear O
from O
him O
, O
and O
that O
Ellen S-PERSON
should O
answer O
him O
as O
often O
and O
as O
fully O
as O
she O
liked O
, O
and O
that O
she O
would O
not O
even O
ask O
to O
see O
her O
letters O
to O
him O
, O
or O
all O
his O
to O
her O
, O
as O
they O
might O
have O
many O
little O
affectionate O
things O
to O
say O
to O
each O
other O
, O
that O
they O
might O
not O
care O
about O
any O
one O
else O
seeing O
, O
and O
she O
would O
trust O
them O
both O
— O
Ellen S-PERSON
seemed O
as O
if O
one S-CARDINAL
pain O
was O
soothed O
, O
and O
if O
indeed O
she O
heard O
often O
from O
him O
, O
she O
might O
bear O
his O
departure O
. O
But O
there O
was O
still O
the O
other O
source O
of O
unhappiness O
, O
recalled O
every O
time O
she O
met O
Miss O
Harcourt's S-PERSON
cold O
suspicious O
look O
, O
which O
had O
not O
changed O
even O
then O
. O
Still O
she O
tried O
to O
join O
her O
cousins O
, O
and O
get O
her O
work O
, O
for O
there O
were O
no O
studies O
that O
morning O
, O
and O
so O
some O
little O
time O
passed O
, O
by O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
exertions O
, O
almost O
cheerfully O
| | O
but O
then O
Ellen S-PERSON
left O
the O
room O
to O
get O
something O
she O
wanted O
, O
and O
, O
in O
seeking O
her O
own O
, O
passed O
Edward's S-PERSON
room O
, O
the O
door O
of O
which O
stood O
half S-CARDINAL
open O
. O
She O
could O
not O
resist O
entering O
, O
and O
every O
thing O
spoke O
of O
him O
so O
vividly O
, O
and O
yet O
seemed O
so O
to O
tell O
her O
he O
had O
gone O
, O
really O
gone O
, O
and O
she O
was O
quite O
alone O
, O
that O
all O
the O
pain O
came O
back O
again O
worse O
than O
ever O
, O
and O
she O
laid O
her O
head O
on O
his O
pillow O
, O
and O
her O
long O
- O
checked O
tears O
flowed O
with O
almost O
passionate O
violence O
. O
" O
My O
dear O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
I O
have O
been O
looking O
for O
you O
every O
where O
, O
" O
said O
her O
aunt's O
kind O
voice O
, O
full O
an O
hour O
afterward O
| | O
" O
Emmeline S-PERSON
went O
into O
your O
room O
and O
could O
not O
find O
you O
, O
and O
I O
could O
not O
imagine O
what O
had O
become O
of O
you O
. O
It O
was O
not O
wise O
of O
you O
to O
come O
here O
just O
this O
morning O
, O

You O
have O
been O
so O
brave O
, O
so O
unselfish O
all O
this O
week O
, O
that O
I O
must O
not O
let O
you O
give O
way O
now O

Try O
and O
think O
only O
that O
Edward S-PERSON
will O
be O
happier O
as O
a O
sailor O
than O
he O
would O
be O
remaining O
with O
you O

and O
though O
I O
know O
you O
must O
miss O
him O
very O
, O
very O
painfully O
, O
you O
will O
be O
able O
to O
bear O
it O
better O
. O
Poor O
Alice B-PERSON
Seaton E-PERSON
, O
of O
whom O
you O
have O
heard O
me O
speak O
, O
has O
no O
such O
comfort O

her O
brother O
could O
not O
bear O
the O
idea O

uncle O

for O
him O

his O
poor O
sister O

not O
only O
that O
pain O

you O
can O
fancy O
how O
dreadful O
it O
would O
be O
, O
if O
Edward S-PERSON
had O
left O
us O
for O
a O
life O
in O
which O
he O
thought O
he O
should O
be O
miserable O
— O

is O
obliged O
to O
leave O
the O
aunt O

loves O
, O
as O
much O
, O
I O
think O
, O
as O
you O
love O
me O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
and O
go O
as O
a O
teacher O
in O
a O
school O
, O
to O
bear O
her O
accumulated O
sorrow O
quite O
alone O
. O
Sad O
as O
your O
trial O
is O
, O
you O
have O
still O
many O
things O
to O
bless O
God O
for O
, O
dearest O
, O
as O
I O
am O
sure O
you O
will O
acknowledge O
, O
if O
, O
when O
the O
pain O
of O
the O
present O
moment O
has O
subsided O

you O
think O
of O
Alice S-PERSON
, O

try O
to O
put O
yourself O
in O
her O
place O
. O
" O
" O
It O
is O
not O
only O
parting O
from O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
" O
answered O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
trying O
to O
check O
her O
tears O
, O
but O
clasping O
her O
arms O
still O
closer O
round O
her O
aunt O
, O
as O
if O
dreading O
that O
her O
own O
words O
should O
send O
her O
from O
her O
. O
" O
Not O
only O
parting O
from O
Edward S-PERSON

Ellen S-PERSON
, O
love O
! O
what O
is O
it O
then O
? O
tell O
me O
, O
" O
replied O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
surprised O
and O
almost O
alarmed O
. O
But O
Ellen S-PERSON
could O
not O
go O
on O
, O
much O
as O
she O
wished O
it O
, O
for O
her O
momentary O
courage O
had O
deserted O
her O
, O
and O
she O
could O
only O
cry O
more O
bitterly O
than O
before O
. O
" O
Have O
you O
done O
any O
thing O
wrong O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
? O
and O
have O
you O
forgotten O
my O
promise O

" O
inquired O
her O
aunt O
, O
after O
waiting O
several B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
, O
and O
speaking O
very O
sorrowfully O
. O
" O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
thinks O
I O
have O
, O
aunt O

indeed O

indeed O
, O
I O
have O
not O

not O
been O
so O
very O
wicked O

to O
tell O
another O
falsehood O

I O
know O
no O
one O
can O
believe O
me O

I O
would O
rather O
you O
should O
know O
it O

even O
if O

if O
you O
punish O
me O
again O

" O
" O
You O
must O
try O
to O
be O
more O
calm O
, O
my O
dear O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
and O
tell O
me O
clearly O
what O
is O
causing O
you O
so O
much O
additional O
suffering O

for O
I O
can O
not O
quite O
understand O
you O

I O
certainly O
shall O
not O
punish O
you O
, O
unless O
quite O
convinced O
you O
have O
failed O
in O
truth O
again O
, O
which O
I O
do O
not O
think O
you O

Tell O
me O
exactly O
what O
it O
is O
, O

look O
at O
me O
while O
you O
are O
speaking O

" O
Ellen S-PERSON
tried O
to O
obey O
, O
but O
her O
grief O
had O
gained O
such O
an O
ascendency O
, O
that O
it O
was O
very O
difficult O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
looked O
very O
thoughtful O
when O
she O
ceased O
, O
for O
she O
really O
was O
more O
perplexed O
than O
she O
allowed O
Ellen S-PERSON
to O
perceive O
| | O
and O
the O
poor O
child O
, O
fancying O
her O
silence O
could O
only O
mean O
disbelief O
and O
condemnation O
, O
remained O
quiet O
and O
trembling O
by O
her O
side O
. O
" O
I O
promised O
you O
that O
I O
would O
not O
doubt O
you O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
and O
I O
will O
not O
now O
, O
though O
appearances O
are O
so O
strong O
against O
you O
, O
" O
she O
said O
, O
after O
several O
minutes' O
thought O
. O
" O
Come O
with O
me O
to O
the O
school O

room O

show O
me O
your O
exercise O

book O

I O
may O
find O
some O
clew O
to O
explain O
this O
mystery O

" O
Ellen S-PERSON
thought O
that O
was O
quite O
impossible O

but O
, O
inexpressibly O
comforted O
by O
her O
aunt's O
trust O
, O
she O
went O
with O
her O
directly O
. O
" O
Ellen S-PERSON
has O
been O
telling O
me O
that O
you O
have O

very O
much O
displeased O

her O
, O
my O
dear O
Lucy S-PERSON
, O
" O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
said O
, O
directly O
she O
entered O
, O
addressing O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
sitting O
reading O
with O
Caroline S-PERSON
and O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
" O
and O
certainly O
with O
great O
apparent O
justice O

but O
she O
is O
so O
unhappy O
about O
it O
, O
that O
I O
can O
scarcely O
believe O
that O
she O
has O
forgotten O
all O
which O
passed O
between O
us O
a O
short O
time O
ago O
, O

I O
am O
going O
, O
therefore O
, O
with O
your O
permission O

try O

I O
can O
not O
discover O
something O

may O
throw O
a O
light O
on O
the O
subject O

" O
" O
I O
am O
afraid O
that O
will O
scarcely O
be O
possible O

replied O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON

" O
however O
, O
I O
am O
glad O

has O
had O
the O
candor O
to O
tell O
you O

instead O

receive O
your O
notice O

done O
the B-DATE

" O
Ellen S-PERSON
had O
brought O
her O
book O
while O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
was O
speaking O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
attentively O
examined O
it O
. O
" O
Did O
you O
not O
begin O
one O
like O
this O
the O
same O
day O
, O
Caroline S-PERSON
? O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
mamma O

don't O
you O
remember O

were O
obliged O
to O
send O
to O
Harris S-PERSON
for O
them O
? O
as O
the O
parcel O
with O
the O
stationery O
did O
not O
come O
from O
Exeter S-GPE
as O
soon O
as O
we O
expected O
. O
And O
we O
noticed O
how O
much O
thinner O
they O
were O
, O
though O
they O
were O
the O
same O
sized O
books O
. O
" O
" O
And O
did O
I O
not O
hear O
you O
say O
something O
about O
their O
having O
the O
same O
number O
of O
leaves O
, O
and O
therefore O
it O
must O
have O
been O
only O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
paper O

made O
the O
difference O
? O
" O
" O
What O
a O
memory O
you O
have O
, O
mamma O
, O

answered O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
smiling O
. O
" O
I O
did O
not O
think O
you O
were O
taking O
the O
least O
notice O
of O
us O

I O
do O
remember O
saying O
so O
now O

, O
indeed O
, O
I O
very O
often O
wish O
the O
quality O
had O
been O
the O
same O

for O
our O
writing O
looks O
horrid O

you O
happen O

remember O
the O
number O

if O
they O
were O
both O
alike O

I O
know O

had O
both O
the O

a O
moment O

" O
And O
with O
her O
usual O
quickness O
of O
movement O
, O
Caroline S-PERSON
unlocked O
her O
desk O
, O
drew O
forth O
her O
book O
, O
and O
ran O
over O
the O
leaves O

" O
I O

Then O
, O
by O
some O
incomprehensible O

two S-CARDINAL

have O
disappeared O
from O
Ellen's S-GPE

to O
do O
it O

when O
Edward S-PERSON
depended O
so O
much O
on O
my O
going O
out O
with O
him O

I O
thought O

my O
desk O

soon O

dry O

away O

next O

added O

some O
sudden O
light O
had O
flashed O
upon O
her O

then O
, O
really O
grieved O

am O
so O
very O
, O
very O
sorry O

all O
my O
haste O

carelessness O
that O
has O
caused O
Ellen S-PERSON
all O
this O
unhappiness O

I O
was O
in O
such O
a O
hurry O
to O
copy O
the O
poem O
for O
Lady O
Helen S-PERSON
, O
that O
I O
tore O
a O
blank O
leaf O
out O

an O
open O
book O
on O
the O
table O
, O
without O

In O
my O
haste O
the O
book O
fell O
to O
the O
ground O

I O
picked O
it O
up O
to O
write O
on O
it O
, O

never O
noticed O

the O
fellow O

out O

it O
must O
have O
done O

no O

Fanny S-PERSON
carried O
it O
away O
with O
some O
other O
torn O
papers O

she O
asked O
me O

more O

Mrs. O

truly O
relieved O

from O

perceiving O
Caroline's S-PERSON
voluntarily O
offered O
kiss O
was O
willingly O

heartily O
returned O

Ellen S-PERSON

was O
almost O
the O

earnestly O

in O
a O
moment O

still O
doubted O

ringing O
the O
bell O

madam O

there O
was O
one O
like O
the O
page O
out O
of O
a O
book O
, O
which O
made O
me O
ask O
Miss O
Hamilton S-PERSON
if O
they O
were O
all O
to O
be O
destroyed O
. O
It O
was O
such O
a O
nice O
clean O
piece O
, O
only O
being O
written O
on O
one O
side O
, O
that O
I O
wrapped O
up O
some O
lace O
in O
it O
— O
Mrs. O
Ellis S-PERSON
having O
only B-TIME
half I-TIME
an I-TIME
hour E-TIME
before O
scolded O
me O
for O
not O
keeping O
it O
more O
carefully O
. O
" O
" O
Bring O
me O
the O
leaf O

my O
good O
girl O
, O
and O
Miss O
Ellen S-PERSON
will O
give O
you O
a O
still O
better O
piece O
for O
the O
purpose O
, O
" O
replied O
her O
mistress O
, O
quite O
unable O
to O
suppress O
a O
smile O
, O
and O
Ellen S-PERSON
hastily O
took O
out O
a O
large O
sheet O
of O
writing O
paper O
, O
and O
the O
moment O
Fanny S-PERSON
returned O
( O
she O
seemed O
gone O
an O
age O
) O
gave O
it O
to O
her O
, O
and O
seized O
her O
own O
, O
which O
she O
placed O
in O
her O
aunt's O
hand O
, O
without O
being O
able O
to O
speak O
a O
single O
word O
. O
" O
I O
think O
that O
is O
the O
very O
theme O
, O
and O
certainly O
Ellen's S-PERSON
writing O
, O
my O
dear O
Lucy S-PERSON

we O
can O
have O
no O
more O
doubt O
now O
, O
" O
said O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
the O
moment O
Fanny S-PERSON
had O
left O
the O
room O
, O
delighted O
with O
the O
exchange O
, O
and O
drawing O
Ellen S-PERSON
close O
to O
her O
, O
for O
the O
poor O
child O
could O
really O
scarcely O
stand O
. O
" O
I O
have O
done O
you O
injustice O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
and O
I O
beg O
your O
pardon O
, O
" O
replied O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
directly O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
would O
have O
been O
better O
pleased O
had O
she O
stopped O
there O
, O
but O
she O
could O
not O
help O
adding O
, O
" O
You O
know O
I O
should O
never O
have O
doubted O
you O
, O
if O
you O
had O
not O
so O
often O
forfeited O
truth O
. O
" O
Ellen's S-PERSON
first S-ORDINAL
impulse O
had O
been O
to O
go O
to O
her O
, O
but O
her O
last O
words O
caused O
her O
to O
bury O
her O
face O
on O
her O
aunt's O
shoulder O
. O
" O
I O
really O
think O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
you O
ought O
to O
thank O
Ellis S-PERSON
for O
giving O
Fanny S-PERSON
a O
scolding O
, O
as O
it O
has O
done O
you O
such O
excellent O
service O
, O
" O
resumed O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
playfully O
| | O
" O
and O
what O
fee O
are O
you O
going O
to O
give O
me O
for O
taking O
upon O
myself O
to O
prove O
your O
innocence O
in O
open O
court O

I O
think O
myself O
so O
very O
clever O
, O
that O
I O
shall O
tell O
Percy S-PERSON
I O
am O
a O
better O
lawyer O
without O
study O
, O
than O
he O
can O
hope O
to O
be O
with O
. O
You O
don't O
seem O
very O
capable O
of O
doing O
any O
thing O
but O
kissing O
me O
now O
, O
and O
so O
I O
will O
not O
be O
very O
exacting O
. O
You O
have O
cried O
yourself O
almost O
ill O
, O
and O
so O
must O
bear O
the O
penalty O
. O
Go O
and O
lie O
down O
in O
my O
dressing O

an O
hour O

what O
a O
kind O

affectionate O
nurse O
you O
can O
be O

It O
is O
never O
too O
early O

such O
a O
complete O
woman's O
office O

" O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
quite O
proud O
of O
the O
charge O
, O
and O
more O
grieved O
than O
she O
very O
well O
knew O
how O
to O
express O
, O
till O
she O
was O
quite O
alone O
with O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
that O
she O
, O
too O
, O
had O
suspected O
and O
been O
cold O
to O
her O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
week E-DATE
, O
left O
the O
room O
with O
her O
cousin O

Caroline S-PERSON
seemed O
to O
hesitate O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
but O
she O
was O
quite O
certain O
by O
her O
mother's O
face O
that O
she O
wished O
to O
speak O
with O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
, O
and O
so O
, O
without O
being O
told O
, O
took O
up O
her O
book O
, O
and O
went O
into O
the O
library O
. O
" O
And O
now O
, O
Lucy S-PERSON
, O
I O
am O
going O
to O
ask O
you O
a O
personal O
favor O

" O
began O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
the O
moment O
they O
were O
alone O
. O
" O
That O
I O
will O
try O
and O
not O
judge O
Ellen S-PERSON
so O
harshly O
again O

" O
was O
her O
instant O
reply O

" O
you O
have O
every O
right O
to O
desire O
it O
, O
my O
dear O
friend O

not O
to O
ask O
it O
as O
a O
favor O

I O
was O
too O
prejudiced O
and O
too O
hasty O

but O
your O
own O
dear O
children O
are O
so O
truthful O
, O
so O
open O
, O
that O
I O
fear O
they O
have O
quite O
spoiled O
me O
for O
the O
necessary O
patience O
and O
forbearance O
with O
others O
. O
" O
" O
You O
have O
not O
quite O
guessed O
it O
, O
Lucy S-PERSON
. O
Appearances O
were O
so O
very O
strongly O
against O
that O
poor O
child O
, O
that O
I O
am O
not O
at O
all O
astonished O
you O
should O
have O
disbelieved O
her O
assertion O
. O
In O
the O
moment O
of O
irritation O
, O
it O
is O
not O
unlikely O
I O
should O
have O
done O
so O
myself O
| | O
but O
the O
favor O
I O
am O
going O
to O
ask O
you O
, O
is O
merely O
that O
you O
will O
try O
and O
never O
show O
that O
you O
doubt O
her O
word O
, O
or O
refer O
to O
her O
past O
failures O
. O
I O
am O
quite O
convinced O
that O
untruth O
is O
not O
Ellen's S-PERSON
natural O
disposition O
, O
but O
that O
it O
has O
been O
caused O
by O
the O
same O
circumstances O
which O
have O
made O
her O
such O
a O
painfully O
timid O
, O
too O
humble O
character O
. O
If O
, O
with O
all O
her O
efforts O
to O
conquer O
herself O
, O
she O
still O
finds O
her O
word O
doubted O
, O
and O
the O
past O
brought O
forward O
, O
she O
never O
will O
be O
able O
to O
succeed O
. O
Examine O
as O
strictly O
and O
carefully O
as O
you O
please O
, O
and O
as O
I O
am O
sure O
she O
will O
desire O
, O
if O
necessary O
— O
as O
she O
did O
to O
- O
day O
— O
but O
oblige O
me O

never O
doubt O
her O

If O
she O
finds O
we O
never O
do O
, O
it O
will O
raise O
her O
self O

esteem O

give O
her O
a O
still O
further O
incentive O
to O
adhere O
as O
strictly O
to O
the O
truth O
, O
as O
she O
sees O

believe O

I O
am O
certain O
the O
habit O
of O
falsehood O
has O
often O
been O
strengthened O
by O
the O
injudicious O

cruel O
references O
to O
one S-CARDINAL
or O
two S-CARDINAL
childish O
failures O

If O
I O
am O

what O
is O
the O
use O
of O
trying O
to O
tell O
the O
truth O
? O
is O
the O
very O
natural O
question O

and O
the O
present O
pain O
of O
carefulness O
being O
greater O
than O
the O
visible O
amount O
of O
evil O

the O
habit O
is O
confirmed O
. O
Will O
you O
oblige O
me O

my O
guidance O

your O

are O
you O

I O
ever O

in O
act O

the O
very O
intrusting O

discovered O
that O

some O
few O
notions O
peculiar O
perhaps O
to O
myself O

that O
one O
among O

replied O
Mrs. O

laughing O
also O

" O
it O
would O
be O
rather O
hard O

we O
have O
entered O

she O
continued O

rather O
more O
seriously O

" O
you O

at O

me O

" O
and O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
willingly O
assented O
. O
The B-DATE
day E-DATE
passed O
much O
more O
happily O
than O
the O
morning O
could O
have O
anticipated O
. O
Emmeline's S-PERSON
nursing O
was O
so O
affectionate O
and O
successful O
, O
that O
Ellen S-PERSON
was O
quite O
able O
to O
join O
them O
at O
dinner O
, O
and O
her O
aunt O
had O
selected O
such O
a O
very O
interesting O
story O
to O
read O
aloud O
, O
in O
which O
one S-CARDINAL
character O
was O
a O
young O
sailor O
, O
that O
the O
hours O
seemed O
to O
fly O
| | O
and O
then O
they O
had O
a O
long O
talk O
about O
poor O
Alice B-PERSON
Seaton E-PERSON
and O
her O
brother O
, O
whether O
it O
would O
be O
possible O
for O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
to O
place O
young O
Seaton S-PERSON
in O
a O
situation O
that O
he O
liked O
better O
, O
and O
that O
his O
health O
was O
more O
fitted O
for O
. O
Ellen S-PERSON
said O
she O
should O
like O
to O
see O
and O
know O
Alice S-PERSON
so O
much O
, O
for O
her O
trial O
must O
be O
such O
a O
very O
hard O
one O
, O
that O
her O
aunt O
promised O
her O
she O
should O
in O
the O
midsummer O
holidays O
, O
for O
Alice S-PERSON
should O
then O
come O
and O
spend O
a O
week O
with O
them O
. O
It O
seemed O
as O
if O
not O
to O
be O
able O
to O
wish O
Edward S-PERSON
good O
- O
night O
, O
and O
kiss O
him O
, O
brought O
back O
some O
of O
the O
pain O
again O

but O
she O
found O
that O
thinking O
about O
poor O
Alice S-PERSON
, O
and O
fancying O
how O
miserable O
she O
must O
be O
, O
if O
she O
loved O
her O
aunt O
as O
dearly O
as O
she O
did O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON

as O
well O
as O
her O
brother O

at O

school O

made O
her O
pain O
seem O
less O
absorbing O

as O
if O
to O

Alice S-PERSON

do O
more O
toward O

that O
we O
recommence O
our O
narrative O

Over O
this O
interval O
, O
however O
, O
much O
as O
we O
are O
anxious O
to O
proceed O
, O
we O
must O
take O
a O
brief O
glance O
, O
clearly O
to O
understand O
the O
aspect O
of O
the O
Oakwood S-GPE
home O
affairs O
, O
which O
, O
from O
the O
increasing O
age O
of O
the O
younger O
members O
, O
had O
undergone O
some O
slight O
change O
. O
The O
greatest O
and O
most O
keenly O
felt O
was O
the O
departure O
of O
Percy S-PERSON
and O
Herbert S-PERSON
for O
college O
, O
the O
October B-DATE
twelvemonth E-DATE
after O
Edward S-PERSON
had O
gone O
| | O
the O
house O
seemed O
actually O
desolate O
without O
them O
. O
Percy's S-PERSON
wild O
jokes O
and O
inexhaustible O
spirits O
, O
and O
Herbert's O
quiet O
, O
unobtrusive O
kindness O
, O
much O
as O
they O
had O
always O
been O
truly O
appreciated O
by O
their O
home O
circle O
, O
still O
scarcely O
seemed O
to O
have O
been O
fully O
felt O
till O
the O
young O
men O
were O
gone O
| | O
and O
the O
old O
house O
actually O
seemed O
enwrapped O
in O
a O
silence O
, O
which O
it O
required O
very O
determined O
effort O
on O
the O
part O
of O
all O
who O
remained O
in O
the O
least O
degree O
to O
dispel O
. O
Our O
readers O
who O
are O
mothers O
, O
and O
earnest O
ones O
, O
will O
easily O
understand O
the O
anxious O
tremblings O
of O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
heart O
, O
when O
she O
parted O
from O
her O
boys O
for O
the O
world O
: O
for O
such O
, O
to O
spirits O
fresh O
, O
boyish O
, O
unsophisticated O
, O
as O
they O
still O
were O
, O
Oxford S-ORG
could O
not O
fail O
to O
be O
. O
For O
Herbert S-PERSON
, O
indeed O
, O
she O
had O
neither O
fear O
nor O
doubt O
: O
no O
sneer O
, O
no O
temptation O
, O
no O
bad O
example O
, O
would O
affect O
him O
, O
in O
whom O
every O
passing O
year O
seemed O
to O
increase O
and O
deepen O
those O
exalted O
feelings O
which O
, O
in O
his O
earliest O
childhood O
, O
had O
" O
less O
in O
them O
of O
earth O
than O
heaven O
. O
" O
His O
piety O
was O
so O
real O
, O
his O
faith O
so O
fervent O
, O
his O
affections O
so O
concentrated O
in O
his O
home O
and O
in O
one S-CARDINAL
other O
individual O
, O
his O
love O
and O
pursuit O
of O
study O
so O
ardent O
and O
unceasing O
, O
his O
one S-CARDINAL
aim O
, O
to O
become O
worthy O
in O
heart O
and O
mind O
to O
serve O
God O
as O
his O
minister O
, O
so O
ever O
present O
, O
that O
he O
was O
effectually O
guarded O
even O
from O
the O
world O
. O
Percy S-PERSON
had O
none O
of O
these O
feelings O
to O
the O
same O
extent O
, O
save O
his O
ardent O
love O
for O
home O
and O
its O
inmates O
— O
his O
mother O
, O
above O
all O
. O
He O
did O
, O
indeed O
, O
give O
every O
promise O
that O
the O
principles O
so O
carefully O
instilled O
had O
taken O
firm O
root O
, O
and O
would O
guide O
his O
conduct O
in O
the O
world O
| | O
but O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
was O
too O
humble O
- O
minded O
— O
too O
convinced O
that O
every O
human O
effort O
is O
imperfect O
, O
without O
the O
sustaining O
and O
vitalizing O
grace O
of O
God O
, O
to O
rest O
in O
security O
, O
as O
many O
might O
have O
done O
, O
that O
because O
she O
had O
so O
worked O
, O
so O
prayed O
, O
she O
must O
succeed O
. O
She O
was O
hopeful O
, O
indeed O
, O
very O
hopeful O
— O
how O
could O
she O
be O
otherwise O
when O
she O
beheld O
his O
deep O
, O
though O
silent O
, O
reverence O
for O
sacred O
things O
— O
his O
constant O
and O
increasing O
respect O
and O
love O
for O
his O
father O
— O
his O
devoted O
affection O
for O
herself O
— O
his O
attachment O
to O
Herbert S-PERSON
, O
which O
seemed O
so O
strangely O
yet O
so O
beautifully O
to O
combine O
almost O
reverence O
for O
his O
superior O
mind O
and O
holier O
spirit O
, O
with O
the O
caressing O
protectiveness O
of O
an O
older O
for O
a O
younger O
— O
a O
stronger O
for O
a O
weaker O
? O
There O
was O
much O
in O
all O
this O
to O
banish O
anxiety O
altogether O
, O
but O
not O
from O
such O
a O
heart O
as O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
, O
whose O
very O
multiplicity O
of O
blessings O
made O
her O
often O
tremble O
, O
and O
led O
her O
to O
the O
footstool O
of O
her O
God O
, O
with O
a O
piety O
as O
humble O
, O
as O
constant O
, O
as O
fervent O
, O
as O
many O
believe O
is O
the O
fruit O
of O
adversity O
alone O
. O
Caroline S-PERSON
had O
sufficiently O
improved O
as O
greatly O
to O
decrease O
solicitude O
on O
her O
account O
: O
though O
there O
was O
still O
a O
want O
of O
sufficient O
humility O
, O
a O
too O
great O
proneness O
to O
trust O
implicitly O
in O
her O
own O
strength O
, O
an O
inclination O
to O
prejudice O
, O
and O
a O
love O
of O
admiration O
, O
which O
all O
made O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
fear O
would O
expose O
her O
to O
some O
personal O
sorrow O
ere O
they O
were O
entirely O
overcome O
. O
To O
produce O
eternal O
good O
, O
she O
might O
not O
murmur O
at O
temporal O
suffering O
| | O
but O
her O
fond O
heart O
, O
though O
it O
could O
anticipate O
it O
calmly O
for O
herself O
, O
so O
shrunk O
from O
it O
, O
as O
touching O
her O
child O
, O
that O
the O
nearer O
approached O
the O
period O
of O
Caroline's O
introduction O
to O
the O
gay O
world O
, O
the O
more O
painfully O
anxious O
she O
became O
, O
and O
the O
more O
gladly O
would O
she O
have O
retained O
her O
in O
the O
retirement O
of O
Oakwood S-GPE
, O
where O
all O
her O
better O
and O
higher O
qualities O
alone O
had O
play O
. O
But O
she O
knew O
this O
could O
not O
be O
| | O
and O
she O
could O
only O
trust O
that O
her O
anxiety O
would O
be O
proved O
as O
groundless O
with O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
as O
every O
letter O
from O
Oxford S-ORG
proved O
it O
to O
be O
with O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
and O
endeavor O
to O
avert O
it O
by O
never O
wavering O
in O
her O
watchful O
and O
guiding O
love O

Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
at O
fifteen S-DATE
, O
was O
just O
the O
same O
sportive O
, O
happy O
, O
innocent O
child O
as O
she O
had O
been O
at O
twelve O
. O
Her O
feelings O
were O
, O
indeed O
, O
still O
deeper O
, O
her O
imagination O
more O
vivid O
, O
her O
religion O
more O
fervid O
. O
To O
her O
every O
thing O
was O
touched O
with O
poetry O
— O
it O
mattered O
not O
how O
dull O
and O
commonplace O
it O
might O
seem O
to O
other O
people O
| | O
but O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
judicious O
care O
had O
so O
taught O
that O
Truth O
alone O
was O
poetry O
and O
beauty O
— O
the O
Ideal O
only O
lovable O
when O
its O
basis O
was O
the O
Real O
— O
that O
she O
was O
neither O
romantic O
nor O
visionary O
. O
Keen O
as O
her O
sensibilities O
were O
, O
even O
over O
a O
work O
of O
fiction O
, O
they O
prompted O
the O
deed O
and O
act O
of O
kindness O
, O
not O
the O
tear O
alone O
. O
For O
miles O
round O
her O
father's O
large O
domain O
she O
was O
known O
, O
loved O
, O
so O
felt O
as O
a O
guardian O
spirit O
, O
that O
the O
very O
sound O
of O
her O
step O
seemed O
to O
promise O
joy O
. O
She O
actually O
seemed O
to O
live O
for O
others O
— O
making O
their O
pleasures O
hers O
| | O
and O
, O
withal O
, O
so O
joyous O
, O
especially O
in O
her O
own O
home O
and O
at O
Greville B-FAC
Manor E-FAC
, O
that O
even O
anxiety O
seemed O
exorcised O
when O
she O
was O
near O
. O
Before O
strangers O
, O
indeed O
, O
she O
would O
be O
as O
shy O
as O
a O
young O
fawn O

though O
even O
then O
natural O
kindliness O
of O
heart O
prompted O
such O
kindness O
of O
word O
and O
manner O

as O
always O
to O
excite O
the O
wish O

once O
occasioned O
anxiety O

Two S-CARDINAL
or O
three B-DATE
months E-DATE
after O
he O
had O
sailed O
, O
he O
wrote O
home O
in O
the O
highest O
terms O
of O
a O
certain O
Gilbert B-PERSON
Harding E-PERSON
, O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
senior O
midshipmen O
of O
his O
ship O
, O
from O
whom O
he O
had O
received O
kindness O
upon O
kindness O

and O
who O
, O
being O
six S-DATE
or O
seven B-DATE
years E-DATE
older O
than O
himself O
, O
he O
jestingly O
wrote O
to O
his O
aunt O
and O
uncle O
, O
must O
certainly O
be O
the O
very O
best O
friend O
he O
could O
have O
chosen O
, O
as O
he O
was O
much O
too O
old O
to O
lead O
him O
into O
mischief O
. O
Why O
he O
( O
Harding S-PERSON
) O
had O
taken O
such O
a O
fancy O
to O
him O
, O
Edward S-PERSON
could O
not O
tell O
| | O
but O
he O
was O
so O
excessively O
kind O
, O
so O
taught O
him O
his O
duty O
, O
and O
smoothed O
all O
the O
difficulties O
and O
disagreeables O
which O
, O
he O
owned O
, O
had O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
seemed O
overwhelming O
, O
that O
he O
never O
could O
be O
grateful O
enough O
. O
He O
added O
, O
that O
, O
though O
not O
a O
general O
favorite O
with O
his O
immediate O
messmates O
, O
he O
was O
very O
highly O
esteemed O
by O
Sir O
Edward B-PERSON
Manly E-PERSON
and O
his O
other O
superior O
officers O
, O
and O
that O
the O
former O
had O
much O
commended O
him O
for O
his O
kindness O
to O
the O
youngest O
boy O
on O
board O
, O
which O
Edward S-PERSON
was O
. O
It O
was O
very O
easy O
to O
perceive O
that O
young O
Fortescue's S-NORP
susceptible O
affections O
had O
all O
been O
not O
only O
attracted O
, O
but O
already O
riveted O
by O
this O
new O
friend O
. O
All O
the O
young O
party O
at O
Oakwood S-GPE
rejoiced O
at O
it O
| | O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
would O
have O
done O
so O
also O
, O
had O
she O
not O
perceived O
an O
anxious O
expression O
on O
her O
husband's O
face O
, O
which O
alarmed O
her O
. O
He O
did O
not O
, O
however O
, O
make O
any O
remark O
till O
he O
had O
spoken O
to O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
, O
and O
then O
imparted O
to O
his O
wife O
alone O
( O
not O
choosing O
to O
create O
suspicion O
in O
the O
open O
hearts O
of O
his O
children O
) O
that O
this O
Gilbert B-PERSON
Harding E-PERSON
, O
though O
very O
young O
at O
the O
time O
had O
been O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
principal O
actors O
in O
the O
affair O
which O
had O
caused O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
to O
dismiss O
his O
pupils O
, O
as O
we O
related O
in O
a O
former O
page O
| | O
that O
his O
very O
youth O
, O
for O
he O
could O
scarcely O
have O
been O
more O
than O
eleven O
or O
twelve S-CARDINAL
, O
and O
determined O
hardihood O
, O
so O
marked O
natural O
depravity O
, O
that O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
had O
had O
less O
hope O
for O
him O
than O
for O
any O
of O
the O
others O
. O
This O
opinion O
had O
been O
borne O
out O
by O
his O
after O
conduct O
at O
home O
| | O
but O
the O
affair O
had O
been O
successfully O
hushed O
up O
by O
his O
family O
| | O
and O
by O
immense O
interest O
he O
been O
permitted O
to O
enter O
the O
navy O
, O
where O
, O
it O
was O
said O
, O
his O
youthful O
errors O
had O
been O
so O
redeemed O
, O
and O
his O
courage O
and O
conduct O
altogether O
had O
so O
won O
him O
applause O
, O
that O
no O
farther O
fears O
were O
entertained O
for O
him O
. O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
alone O
retained O
his O
opinion O
, O
that O
the O
disposition O
was O
naturally O
bad O
, O
and O
doubted O
the O
internal O
response O
to O
the O
seeming O
outward O
good O
| | O
and O
he O
was O
grieved O
and O
anxious O
beyond O
measure O
, O
when O
he O
heard O
that O
he O
was O
not O
only O
on O
board O
the O
same O
ship O
as O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
but O
already O
his O
favorite O
companion O
and O
most O
trusted O
friend O
. O
His O
anxiety O
, O
of O
course O
, O
extended O
itself O
to O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
to O
such O
a O
degree O
, O
that O
at O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
moment O
they O
would O
gladly O
have O
endeavored O
to O
exchange O
his O
ship O
| | O
but O
this O
would O
have O
seemed O
very O
strange O
to O
Sir O
Edward B-PERSON
Manly E-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
Mr. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
most O
valued O
friends O
. O
He O
had O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
actually O
delayed O
Edward's S-PERSON
becoming O
a O
midshipman O
till O
Sir O
Edward S-PERSON
could O
take O
him O
in O
his O
own O
ship O
and O
now O
to O
place O
him O
elsewhere O
was O
really O
impossible O
| | O
and O
, O
after O
all O
, O
though O
he O
might O
be O
removed O
from O
Harding's S-PERSON
influence O
, O
how O
could O
his O
anxious O
guardians O
know O
all O
with O
whom O
he O
might O
be O
thrown O
? O
They O
were O
obliged O
to O
content O
themselves O
with O
writing O
earnestly O
and O
affectionately O
to O
Edward S-PERSON
| | O
and O
, O
painful O
as O
it O
was O
, O
to O
throw O
a O
doubt O
and O
shade O
over O
such O
youthful O
confidence O
and O
affection O
, O
implored O
him O
not O
to O
trust O
too O
implicitly O
in O
Harding S-PERSON
| | O
that O
his O
character O
had O
not O
always O
been O
free O
from O
stain O
| | O
that O
he O
( O
Edward S-PERSON
) O
was O
still O
so O
young O
and O
so O
susceptible O
, O
he O
might O
find O
that O
he O
had O
imbibed O
principles O
, O
and O
been O
tempted O
to O
wrong O
almost O
unconsciously O
, O
and O
suffer O
from O
its O
effects O
when O
too O
late O
to O
escape O
. O
They O
wrote O
as O
affectionately O
and O
indulgently O
as O
they O
could O
— O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
, O
as O
well O
as O
his O
aunt O
and O
uncle O
| | O
but O
still O
they O
felt O
that O
it O
certainly O
did O
appear O
cruel O
to O
warn O
a O
young O
, O
warm O
heart O
to O
break O
off O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
friendship O
it O
had O
formed O
| | O
especially O
as O
he O
beheld O
that O
friend O
approved O
of O
by O
his O
captain O
, O
and O
looked O
up O
to O
by O
the O
crew O
. O
And O
that O
Edward's S-PERSON
reply O
was O
somewhat O
cold O
, O
though O
he O
did O
promise O
caution O
, O
and O
assure O
them O
he O
had O
not O
so O
forgotten O
the O
influences O
and O
principles O
of O
Oakwood S-ORG
as O
to O
allow O
any O
one O
to O
lead O
him O
into O
error O
, O
did O
not O
surprise O
them O
. O
He O
never O
referred O
to O
Harding S-PERSON
again O
, O
except O
sometimes O
casually O
to O
mention O
his O
companionship O
, O
or O
some O
act O
which O
had O
won O
him O
approval O
| | O
and O
they O
really O
hoped O
their O
letters O
had O
had O
at O
least O
the O
effect O
of O
putting O
him O
on O
his O
guard O
. O
Sir O
Edward B-PERSON
Manly's E-PERSON
own O
reply O
to O
Mr. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
anxious O
appeal O
to O
him O
, O
however O
, O
succeeded O
in O
quieting O
their O
fears O
| | O
he O
assured O
them O
he O
had O
seen O
nothing O
in O
Harding's S-PERSON
conduct O
, O
since O
he O
had O
been O
at O
sea O
, O
to O
render O
him O
an O
unfit O
companion O
for O
any O
boy O
: O
that O
he O
had O
heard O
of O
some O
boyish O
faults O
, O
but O
it O
was O
rather O
hard O
he O
was O
to O
suffer O
from O
them O
as O
a O
man O
| | O
and O
he O
assured O
his O
friends O
that O
he O
would O
keep O
a O
strict O
look O
- O
out O
after O
young O
Fortescue S-PERSON
, O
and O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
appearance O
of O
a O
change O
in O
a O
character O
which O
, O
young O
as O
he O
was O
, O
he O
could O
not O
help O
loving O
, O
should O
be O
inquired O
into O
, O
and O
the O
friendship O
ended O
by O
sending O
Harding S-PERSON
to O
some O
other O
ship O
. O
So O
wrote O
Sir O
Edward B-PERSON
Manly E-PERSON
, O
with O
the O
fullest O
possible O
intention O
to O
perform O
| | O
and O
Edward's S-PERSON
anxious O
friends O
were O
happy O
, O
more O
especially O
as O
letter O
after O
letter O
brought O
praises O
of O
the O
young O
sailor O
from O
captain O
, O
officers O
, O
and O
crew O
, O
and O
his O
own O
epistles O
, O
though O
brief O
, O
were O
affectionate O
and O
satisfactory O
. O
It O
was O
happy O
for O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
and O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
, O
too O
, O
that O
they O
were O
ignorant O
of O
the O
multiplicity O
of O
great O
and O
little O
things O
which O
could O
not O
fail O
to O
engross O
the O
mind O
of O
Sir O
Edward B-PERSON
Manly E-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
not O
only O
captain O
of O
the B-PERSON
Prince I-PERSON
William E-PERSON
, O
a O
gallant O
seventy B-DATE
- I-DATE
four E-DATE
, O
but O
commander O
of O
the O
little O
flotilla O
which O
accompanied O
him O
, O
or O
they O
could O
not O
have O
rested O
so O
secure O
. O
Happy O
for O
them O
too O
, O
during O
those O
years O
of O
separation O
, O
that O
they O
were O
not O
perfectly O
acquainted O
with O
Edward's S-PERSON
real O
weakness O
of O
character O
, O
or O
of O
the O
fearful O
extent O
of O
mischief O
which O
the O
influences O
of O
his B-DATE
first I-DATE
twelve I-DATE
years E-DATE
had O
engendered O
. O
Had O
he O
remained O
at O
Oakwood S-GPE
till O
nineteen B-DATE
or I-DATE
twenty E-DATE
, O
it O
is O
probable O
they O
would O
have O
been O
insensibly O
conquered O
, O
and O
the O
impressions O
of O
good O
, O
which O
he O
had O
appeared O
so O
readily O
to O
receive O
, O
really O
taken O
root O
and O
guided O
his O
after O
life O
, O
but O
eighteen B-DATE
months E-DATE
could O
not O
do O
this O
, O
as O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
would O
have O
felt O
, O
had O
she O
known O
all O
the O
effect O
of O
her O
sister's O
ill O
- O
judged O
partiality O
and O
indulgence O

but O
this O
, O
as O
we O
have O
already O
mentioned O
, O
was O
concealed O
from O
her O
by O
the O
bright O
, O
lovable O
, O
winning O
qualities O
, O
which O
alone O
were O
uppermost O

fact O

more O
of O
Edward S-PERSON

all O
thought O

his O
conduct O

so O
frequently O
allowing O
his O
sister O
to O
suffer O
for O
him O
) O
than O
his O
aunt O
, O
penetrative O
as O
she O
was O

and O
, O
therefore O
, O
in O
the O
events O
we O
shall O
have O
occasion O
to O
relate O
, O
we O
trust O
that O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
will O
not O
appear O
an O
inconsistent O
character O
, O
inasmuch O
that O
one O
in O
general O
so O
successfully O
observant O
, O
should O
fail O
in O
penetration O
when O
most O
needed O
. O
Edward's S-PERSON
life O
at O
Oakwood S-GPE
had O
been O
so O
very O
happy O
, O
its O
pleasures O
and O
indulgences O
so O
innocent O
, O
so O
numerous O
, O
that O
he O
did O
not O
himself O
know O
his O
liability O
to O
temptation O
, O
from O
the O
excessive O
love O
of O
pleasure O
which O
his O
mother's O
indiscreet O
indulgence O
had O
originally O
infused O
. O
The O
control O
which O
his O
uncle O
and O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
exercised O
over O
him O
had O
been O
so O
very O
gentle O
and O
forbearing O
, O
that O
he O
had O
scarcely O
ever O
felt O
the O
inclination O
to O
exert O
self O
- O
will O
, O
and O
when O
it O
so O
chanced O
that O
he O
had O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
had O
covered O
his O
fault O
, O
or O
borne O
its O
penalty O
for O
him O
. O
He O
thought O
he O
had O
guided O
himself O
, O
when O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
he O
was O
guided O
| | O
but O
this O
could O
no O
longer O
be O
the O
case O
when O
one O
of O
the O
little O
world O
which O
thronged O
a O
first S-ORDINAL
- O
rate O
man-of O
- O
war O
. O
Outward O
actions O
were O
, O
indeed O
, O
under O
control O

but O
what O
captain O
, O
the O
most O
earnest O
, O
most O
able O
in O
the O
world O
, O
could O
look O
into O
and O
guide O
the O
hearts O
of O
all O
those O
committed O
to O
his O
care O
? O
And O
almost O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
action O
of O
Edward's S-PERSON
unbiased O
will O
was O
indignantly O
to O
tear O
into O
shreds O
, O
and O
scatter O
to O
the O
winds O

on O
Harding S-PERSON
, O
for O
the O
wrong O
that O
he O
thought O
he O
had O
done O
him O
, O
by O
allowing O
his O
eye O
even O
to O
rest O

a O
moment O
on O
such O
base O
, O
unfounded O
aspersions O
on O
his O
name O
. O
When O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
told O
Ellen S-PERSON
that O
her O
letters O
to O
her O
brother O
, O
and O
his O
to O
her O
, O
should O
never O
be O
subjected O
to O
any O
scrutiny O
but O
their O
own O
, O
she O
acted O
on O
a O
principle O
which O
many O
parents O
and O
guardians O
would O
consider O
as O
high O
- O
flown O
and O
romantic O
, O
and O
which O
she O
herself O
had O
most O
painful O
reason O
to O
regret O
— O
the O
effects O
, O
at O
least O
, O
but O
not O
the O
principle O
itself O
, O
for O
that O
was O
based O
on O
too O
refined O
a O
feeling O
to O
waver O
, O
even O
though O
she O
suffered O
from O
it O
. O
She O
could O
not O
bear O
, O
nor O
could O
her O
husband O
, O
the O
system O
which O
prevailed O
in O
some O
families O
of O
their O
acquaintance O
, O
that O
their O
children O
could O
neither O
receive O
nor O
write O
letters O
to O
each O
other O
, O
or O
their O
intimate O
friends O
, O
without O
being O
shown O
to O
their O
seniors O
. O
As O
for O
opening O
and O
reading O
a O
letter O
directed O
to O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
them O
, O
before O
its O
possessor O
saw O
it O
, O
as O
they O
had O
seen O
done O
, O
it O
was O
, O
in O
their O
estimation O
, O
as O
much O
dishonor O
and O
as O
mean O
, O
as O
if O
such O
a O
thing O
had O
been O
done O
to O
an O
adult O
. O
Perfect O
confidence O
in O
their O
home O
they O
had O
indeed O
instilled O
, O
and O
that O
confidence O
was O
never O
withheld O
. O
There O
was O
a O
degree O
of O
suspicion O
attached O
to O
a O
demand O
always O
to O
see O
what O
a O
child O
had O
written O
or O
received O
, O
from O
which O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
pure O
mind O
actually O
shrunk O
in O
loathing O
. O
In O
the B-DATE
many I-DATE
months E-DATE
the O
Grahame S-PERSON
family O
passed O
in O
London S-GPE
, O
Annie S-PERSON
and O
Caroline S-PERSON
corresponded O
without O
the O
least O
restraint O
: O
no O
doubt O
many O
would O
pronounce O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
very O
unwise O
, O
knowing O
Annie S-PERSON
so O
well O
, O
and O
trembling O
for O
Caroline S-PERSON
as O
she O
did O
| | O
but O
, O
as O
she O
told O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
, O
she O
had O
some O
notions O
peculiar O
to O
herself O
( O
they O
always O
had O
the O
sanction O
and O
sympathy O
of O
her O
husband O
, O
however O
) O
, O
and O
this O
was O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
them O
. O
She O
was O
always O
pleased O
and O
interested O
in O
all O
that O
her O
children O
read O
to O
her O
, O
either O
from O
their O
own O
epistles O
or O
those O
they O
received O
, O
and O
if O
they O
wished O
it O
, O
read O
them O
herself O
, O
but O
she O
never O
asked O
to O
do O
so O
, O
and O
the O
consequence O
was O
, O
that O
the O
most O
perfect O
confidence O
was O
given O
. O
When O
Ellen S-PERSON
and O
Edward S-PERSON
parted O
, O
they O
were O
both O
so O
young O
, O
that O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
had O
hesitated O
as O
to O
whether O
his O
wife O
was O
quite O
justified O
in O
the O
perfect O
trust O
with O
which O
she O
treated O
them O
, O
and O
whether O
it O
would O
not O
be O
wiser O
to O
overlook O
their O
correspondence O
| | O
but O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
so O
argued O
that O
their O
very O
youth O
was O
their O
safeguard O
, O
that O
they O
were O
all O
in O
all O
to O
each O
other O
, O
and O
as O
such O
she O
wished O
them O
to O
feel O
they O
were O
bound O
by O
even O
a O
closer O
and O
a O
fonder O
tie O
than O
that O
of O
brother O
and O
sister O
under O
other O
circumstances O
, O
so O
won O
over O
her O
husband O
that O
he O
yielded O
| | O
and O
from O
the O
long O
extracts O
that O
Ellen S-PERSON
would O
read O
of O
Edward's S-PERSON
letters O
to O
the O
family O
in O
general O
, O
and O
of O
her O
own O
to O
her O
aunt O
, O
he O
was O
quite O
satisfied O
as O
to O
the O
wisdom O
of O
his O
wife's O
judgment O
. O
For O
full O
a O
year O
after O
Edward's S-PERSON
departure O
, O
Ellen's S-PERSON
conduct O
and O
general O
improvement O
had O
given O
her O
aunt O
nothing O
but O
pleasure O
| | O
even O
Miss O
Harcourt's S-PERSON
and O
Caroline's S-PERSON
prejudice O
was O
nearly O
removed O
, O
though O
, O
at O
times O
, O
the O
fancy O
would O
steal O
over O
both O
that O
she O
was O
not O
exactly O
what O
she O
seemed O
, O
and O
that O
that O
which O
was O
hidden O
was O
not O
exactly O
that O
which O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
believed O
it O
| | O
and O
this O
fancy O
strengthened O
by O
a O
certain O
indefinable O
yet O
felt O
change O
in O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
commencing O
about B-DATE
thirteen I-DATE
months E-DATE
after O
she O
had O
parted O
from O
her O
brother O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
herself O
, O
for O
some O
time O
strove O
against O
belief O
, O
but O
at O
length O
she O
could O
no O
longer O
conceal O
from O
herself O
that O
Ellen S-PERSON
was O
becoming O
reserved O
again O
, O
and O
fearful O
, O
at O
times O
almost O
shrinking O
, O
and O
sad O
, O
as O
in O
her O
childhood O
. O
The O
openness O
, O
and O
almost O
light O
- O
heartedness O
, O
which O
for O
one B-DATE
brief I-DATE
year E-DATE
had O
so O
characterized O
her O
, O
seemed O
completely O
but O
so O
insensibly O
to O
have O
gone O
, O
that O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
could O
not O
satisfy O
herself O
as O
to O
the O
time O
of O
the O
commencement O
, O
or O
reason O
of O
the O
change O
. O
Her O
temper O
, O
too O
, O
became O
fitful O
, O
and O
altogether O
her O
aunt's O
anxiety O
and O
bewilderment O
as O
to O
her O
real O
character O
returned O
in O
full O
force O
. O
Once O
, O
when O
gently O
questioned O
as O
to O
why O
her O
temper O
was O
so O
altered O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
confessed O
with O
tears O
, O
that O
she O
knew O
it O
was O
, O
but O
she O
could O
not O
help O
it O
, O
she O
believed O
she O
was O
not O
well O
| | O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
called O
in O
Mr. O
Maitland S-PERSON
, O
who O
said O
that O
she O
really O
was O
in O
a O
highly O
nervous O
state O
, O
and O
required O
care O
and O
quietness O
, O
and O
the O
less O
notice O
that O
was O
taken O
of O
her O
momentary O
irritability O
or O
depression O
the O
better O
. O
Little O
did O
the O
worthy O
man O
imagine O
how O
his O
young O
patient O
blessed O
him O
for O
these O
words O
| | O
giving O
a O
reason O
for O
and O
so O
allowing O
the O
trepidation O
which O
paled O
her O
cheek O
, O
parched O
her O
lips O
, O
and O
made O
her O
hand O
so O
tremble O
, O
when O
she O
received O
a O
letter O
from O
her O
brother O
, O
to O
pass O
unnoticed O
. O
But O
change O
in O
manner O
was O
not O
all O
| | O
almost O
every O
second S-ORDINAL
or O
third S-ORDINAL
month O
Ellen's S-ORG
allowance O
of O
pocket O
- O
money O
( O
which O
was O
unusually O
liberal O
, O
as O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
wished O
to O
accustom O
her O
girls O
, O
from O
an O
early O
age O
, O
to O
purchase O
some O
few O
articles O
of O
dress O
for O
themselves O
, O
and O
so O
learn O
the O
value O
of O
money O
) O
most O
strangely O
and O
mysteriously O
disappeared O
. O
Ellen S-PERSON
either O
could O
not O
or O
would O
not O
give O
any O
account O
of O
it O
| | O
and O
, O
of O
course O
, O
it O
not O
only O
exposed O
her O
to O
her O
aunt's O
most O
serious O
displeasure O
, O
but O
inexpressibly O
heightened O
not O
only O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
bewilderment O
and O
anxiety O
, O
but O
Miss O
Harcourt's S-PERSON
and O
Caroline's S-PERSON
unspoken O
prejudice O
. O
From O
the O
time O
of O
Edward's S-PERSON
departure O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
had O
never O
been O
discovered O
in O
or O
suspected O
of O
either O
uttering O
or O
acting O
an O
untruth O

her O
silence O
, O
her O
apparent O
determined O
ignorance O
of O
, O
or O
resolution O
not O
to O
confess O
the O
cause O
of O
the O
incomprehensible O
disappearance O
of O
her O
allowance O
, O
naturally O
compelled O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
to O
revert O
to O
the O
propensity O
of O
her O
childhood O
, O
and O
fear O
that O
truthfulness O
was O
again O
deserting O
her O
. O
Her O
displeasure O
lasting O
of O
course O
, O
the O
longer O
from O
Ellen's S-PERSON
want O
of O
openness O

and O
the O
air O
of O
what O
almost O
appeared O
to O
her O
anxious O
yet O
still O
affectionate O
aunt O
like O
sullen O
defiance O
( O
in O
reality O
, O
it O
was O
almost O
despair O
) O
, O
when O
spoken O
to O

caused O
a O
painful O
degree O
of O
estrangement O
between O
them O

however O
, O
giving O
place O
to O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
usual O
caressing O
manner O
, O
the O
moment O
Ellen S-PERSON
seemed O
really O
repentant O
, O
and O
her O
month's O
expenditure O
could O
be O
properly O
explained O

For O
six B-DATE

eight I-DATE
months E-DATE
before O
the O
day O
on O
which O
we O
recommence O
our O
narrative O

there O
had O
been O
, O
however O
, O
nothing O
to O
complain O
of O
in O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
except O
still O
that O
unnatural O
reserve O
and O
frequent O
depression O
, O
as O
if O
dreading O
something O
she O
knew O
not O
what O
, O
which O
, O
as O
every O
other O
part O
of O
her O
conduct O
was O
satisfactory O
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
tried O
to O
comfort O
herself O
was O
physical O
alone O
. O
No O
reference O
to O
the O
past O
was O
ever O
made O
: O
her O
manner O
to O
her O
niece O
became O
the O
same O
as O
usual O

but O
she O
could O
not O
feel O
secure O
as O
to O
her O
character O
, O
and O
, O
what O
was O
most O
painful O
, O
there O
were O
times O
when O
she O
was O
compelled O
to O
doubt O
even O
Ellen's S-PERSON
affection O
for O
herself O
, O
a O
thing O
she O
had O
never O
had O
the O

cause O
to O
do O
even O
when O
she O
was O
a O
little O
inanimate O
child O
. O
But O
very O
few O
changes O
had O
taken O
place O
in O
the O
Greville S-PERSON

Grahame S-PERSON
families O
. O
Mrs. O
Greville's S-PERSON
trial O
continued O
in O
unmitigated O
, O
if O
not O
heightened O
bitterness O
: O
the O
example O
, O
the O
companionship O
of O
his O
father O
had O
appeared O
to O
have O
blighted O
every O
good O
seed O
which O
she O
had O
strenuously O
endeavored O
to O
plant O
in O
the O
bosom O
of O
her O
son O
. O
At O
sixteen S-DATE
he O
was O
already O
an O
accomplished O
man O
of O
the O
world O
, O
in O
its O
most O
painful O
sense O
: O
he O
had O
his O
own O
companions O
, O
his O
own O
haunts O
| | O
scarcely O
ever O
visiting O
his O
home O
, O
for O
a O
reason O
which O
, O
could O
his O
poor O
mother O
have O
known O
it O
, O
would O
have O
given O
her O
some O
slight O
gleam O
of O
comfort O
. O
He O
could O
not O
associate O
either O
with O
her O
or O
his O
sister O
, O
without O
feeling O
a O
sort O
of O
loathing O
of O
himself O
, O
a O
longing O
to O
be O
to O
them O
as O
Percy S-PERSON
and O
Herbert B-PERSON
Hamilton E-PERSON
were O
at O
Oakwood S-GPE

and O
not O
having O
the O
moral O
courage O
sufficient O
to O
break O
from O
the O
control O
of O
his O
father O
, O
and O
the O
exciting O
pleasures O
in O
which O
that O
control O
initiated O
him O
, O
he O
shrunk O
more O

more O
from O
the O
only O
spot O
in O
which O
better O
feelings O
were O
so O
awakened O
within O
him O
as O
to O
give O
him O
pain O
. O
To O
deaden O
this O
unacknowledged O
remorse O
, O
his O
manner O
was O
rude O
and O
unfeeling O
, O
so O
that O
his O
very O
visits O
, O
though O
inexpressibly O
longed O
for O
by O
his O
mother O
, O
brought O
only O
increase O
of O
grief O
. O
Mrs. O
Greville S-PERSON
seemed O
herself O
so O
inured O
to O
suffering O
, O
that O
she O
bore O
up O
against O
it O
without O
any O
visible O
failing O
of O
health O

struggling O
against O
its O
enervating O
effects O

more O

perhaps O

for O
the O
sake O
of O
one S-CARDINAL
treasure O
still O
granted O
her O
— O
her O
own O
almost O
angel O
Mary S-PERSON
— O
who O
, O
she O
knew O
, O
without O
her O
love O
and O
constant O
cheerfulness O
, O
must O
sink O
beneath O
such O
a O
constant O
aggravated O
trial O
. O
Yet O
that O
very O
love O
brought O
increase O
of O
anxiety O
from O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
one E-CARDINAL
cause O
. O
As O
yet O
there O
was O
no O
change O
in O
their O
manner O
of O
living O
, O
but O
Mrs. O
Greville S-PERSON
knew O
that O
, O
from O
the O
excesses O
of O
her O
husband O
and O
son O
, O
there O
very O
soon O
must O
be O
. O
Ruin O
, O
poverty O
, O
all O
its O
fearful O
ills O
, O
stood O
before O
her O
in O
perspective O
, O
and O
how O
could O
Mary's S-PERSON
fragile O
frame O
and O
gentle O
spirit O
bear O
up O
against O
them O
? O
Again O
and O
again O
the O
question O
pressed O
upon O
her O
— O
Did O
Herbert B-PERSON
Hamilton E-PERSON
indeed O
love O
her O
child O
, O
as O
every O
passing O
year O
seemed O
to O
confirm O
? O
and O
if O
he O
did O
, O
would O
— O
could O
his O
parents O
consent O
to O
his O
union O
with O
the O
child O
of O
such O
a O
father O
, O
the O
sister O
of O
such O
a O
brother O
? O
There O
were O
always O
long O
messages O
to O
Mary S-PERSON
in O
Herbert's S-PERSON
letters O
to O
his O
mother O
, O
which O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
not O
only O
delivered O
herself O
, O
but O
sometimes O
even O
put O
the O
whole O
letter O
into O
Mary's S-PERSON
hand O
, O
and O
at O
last O
laughingly O
said O
, O
she O
really O
thought O
they O
had O
much O
better O
write O
to O
each O
other O
, O
as O
then O
she O
should O
chance O
to O
get O
a O
letter O
all O
to O
herself O
, O
not O
merely O
be O
the O
medium O
of O
a O
communication O
between O
them O
| | O
and O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
though O
she O
did O
slightly O
blush O
, O
which O
she O
was O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
doing O
for O
scarcely O
any O
thing O
, O
seemed O
to O
think O
it O
so O
perfectly O
natural O
, O
that O
she O
merely O
said O
, O
if O
Herbert S-PERSON
had O
time O
to O
write O
to O
her O
, O
she O
should O
like O
it O
very O
much O
, O
and O
would O
certainly O
answer O
him O
. O
" O
My O
dear O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
what O
are O
you O
about O
? O
" O
was O
Mrs. O
Greville's S-PERSON
anxious O
appeal O
, O
the O
moment O
they O
were O
alone O
. O
" O
Giving O
pleasure O
to O
two S-CARDINAL
young O
folks O
, O
of O
whom O
I O
am O
most O
excessively O
fond O
, O
" O
was O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
laughing O
reply O
. O
" O
Don't S-PERSON
look O
so O
terrified O
, O
my O
dear O
Jessie S-PERSON
. O
They O
love O
each O
other O
as O
boy O
and O
girl O
now O
, O
and O
if O
the O
love O
should O
deepen O
into O
that O
of O
man O
and O
woman O
, O
why O
, O
all O
I O
can O
say O
is O
— O
I O
would O
rather O
have O
your O
Mary S-PERSON
for O
my O
Herbert S-PERSON
than O
any O
one O
else O
I O
know O
. O
" O
" O
She O
is O
not O
only O
my O
Mary S-PERSON
! O
" O
answered O
the O
poor O
mother O
, O
with O
such O
a O
quivering O
of O
the O
eye O
and O
lip O
, O
that O
it O
checked O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
joyousness O
at O
once O
. O
" O
She O
is O
your O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
in O
all O
that O
can O
make O
such O
a O
character O
as O
my O
Herbert S-PERSON
happy O
, O
" O
was O
her O
instant O
reply O
, O
with O
a O
pressure O
of O
Mrs. O
Greville's S-PERSON
hand O
, O
that O
said O
far O
more O
than O
her O
words O
. O
" O
I O
am O
not O
one O
of O
those O

like O
to O
make O
matches O

for O
man's O
best O
laid O
schemes O

so O
often O
overthrown O
by O
the O
most O
trifling O

unforeseen O
chances O
, O
that O
display O
a O
much O
wiser O
providence O
than O
our O
greatest O
wisdom O
, O
that O
I O
should O
consider O
it O
almost O
sinful O

do O

never O

a O
thought O

as O
to O
what O
my O

my O
own O
answer O
will O
be O
, O

our O

should O
indeed O

choose O
your O

as O
his O
wife O

, O
certainly O
a O
most O
important O
addition O
, O
should O
she O
wish O
it O
too O
. O
Our O
best O
plan O
now O
is O
to O
let O
them O
follow O
their O

perfect O
confidence O

inclose O
me O

I O
rather O

the O

unreserved O
manner O

she O
was O
right O

, O
we O
think O

did O
the O
purity O
and O
innocence O
of O
those O
letters O
, O
so O
intensely O
interesting O
to O
each O
other O

give O
place O
to O
any O
other O
style O
, O
even O
when O
they O
chanced O
to O
discover O
that O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
was O
utterly O
ignorant O
of O
their O
contents O

except O
that O
which O
they O
chose O

even O
this O
assurance O

the O
part O

one O
so O
loved O

trusted O

Mrs. O

could O
not O
entirely O
remove O
Mrs. O
Greville's S-PERSON
vague O
anticipations O
of O
evil O
. O
Mr. O
Greville S-PERSON
always O
shunned O
, O
and O
declared O
he O
hated O
the O
Hamilton S-PERSON
family O

but O
as O
he O
seemed O
to O
entertain O
the O
same O
feeling O
toward O
herself O
and O
her O
poor O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
she O
tried O
to O
comfort O
herself O
by O
the O
idea O
that O
he O
would O
never O
trouble O
his O
head O
about O
his O
daughter O

get O
her O
out O
of O
his O
way O
, O
especially O
if O
she O
married O
well O

Still O
anxiety O
for O
the O
future O
would O
press O
upon O
her O

only O
calmed O
by O
her O
firm O
, O
unchanging O
faith O
in O
that O
gracious O

ever O

watchful O
Providence S-GPE

her O
heavy O
troubles O

still O
tried O

trust O

order O
all O
things O

the O
best O

it O
was O
this O
, O
this O
faith O
alone O
, O
which O
so O
supported O
her O
, O
as O
to O
permit O
her O
to O
make O
her O
child's O
home O
and O
heart O
almost O
as O
happy O
as O
if O
her O
path O
had O
all O
been O
smooth O
. O
In O
the O
Grahame S-PERSON
family O
a O
change O
had O
taken O
place O
, O
in O
Master B-WORK_OF_ART
Cecil's E-WORK_OF_ART
being O
sent O
to O
Eton S-GPE
some O
time O
before O
his O
father O
had O
intended O
| | O
but O
so O
many O
cases O
of O
Lady O
Helen's S-PERSON
faulty O
indolence O
and O
ruinous O
indulgence O
had O
come O
under O
his O
notice O
, O
that O
he O
felt O
to O
remove O
the O
boy O
from O
her O
influence O
must O
be O
accomplished O
at O
any O
cost O
. O
Cecil S-PERSON
was O
quite O
delighted O
, O
but O
his O
mother O
was O
so O
indignant O
, O
that O
she O
overcame O
her O
habitual O
awe O
of O
her O
husband O
sufficiently O
to O
vow O
that O
she O
would O
not O
live O
so O
far O
from O
her O
son O
, O
and O
if O
he O
must O
go O
to O
school O
, O
she O
must O
leave O
Moorlands S-LOC
. O
Grahame S-PERSON
, O
with O
equal O
positiveness O
, O
declared O
that O
he O
would O
not O
give O
up O
a O
home O
endeared O
to O
him O
so O
long O
, O
nor O
to O
entirely O
break O
off O
his O
companionship O
with O
his O
dearest O
friends O
. O
A O
very O
stormy O
dialogue O
of O
course O
took O
place O
, O
and O
ended O
by O
both O
parties O
being O
more O
resolved O
to O
entertain O
their O
own O
opinion O
. O
The O
interposition O
of O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
however O
, O
obtained O
some O
concession O
on O
Grahame's S-PERSON
part O
, O
and O
he O
promised O
that O
if O
Lady B-PERSON
Helen E-PERSON
would O
make O
Moorlands S-LOC
her O
home O
from O
the B-DATE
middle I-DATE
of I-DATE
July I-DATE
till I-DATE
the I-DATE
end I-DATE
of I-DATE
October I-DATE
, I-DATE
November I-DATE
and I-DATE
December E-DATE
should O
be O
spent O
in O
the O
vicinity O
of O
Eton S-GPE
, O
and O
she O
should O
then O
have O
six B-DATE
months E-DATE
for O
London S-GPE
and O
its O
attractions O
. O
This O
concession O
brought O
back O
all O
Lady B-PERSON
Helen's E-PERSON
smiles O
, O
and O
charmed O
Annie S-PERSON
, O
though O
it O
was O
a O
source O
of O
real O
regret O
to O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
who O
could O
not O
help O
feeling O
a O
little O
pained O
at O
her O
friend's O
small O
concern O
at O
this O
long O
separation O
from O
her O
. O
But O
still O
she O
loved O
her O
| | O
and O
, O
as O
Annie S-PERSON
wrote O
frequently O
, O
and O
when O
she O
was O
at O
Moorlands S-LOC
never O
tired O
of O
her O
society O
( O
the B-DATE
eight I-DATE
months E-DATE
of O
absence O
giving O
her O
so O
much O
interesting O
matter O
to O
impart O
) O
, O
Caroline S-PERSON
was O
not O
only O
satisfied O
, O
but O
insensible O
to O
the O
utter O
want O
of O
sympathy O
which O
Annie S-PERSON
manifested O
in O
her O
pursuits O
, O
her O
pleasures O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
often O
wished O
that O
Caroline S-PERSON
had O
chosen O
one O
more O
deserving O
of O
her O
friendship O
, O
but O
she O
trusted O
that O
time O
and O
experience O
would O
teach O
her O
Annie's S-PERSON
real O
character O
, O
and O
so O
did O
not O
feel O
any O
anxiety O
on O
that O
score O
. O
There O
was O
only O
one S-CARDINAL
member O
in O
Grahame's S-PERSON
family O
, O
that O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
hoped O
might O
bring O
joy O
and O
comfort O
to O
their O
friend O
, O
and O
that O
was O
his O
little O
Lilla S-PERSON
. O
She O
was O
five B-DATE
years E-DATE
younger O
than O
Annie S-PERSON
, O
and O
being O
much O
less O
attractive O
, O
seemed O
almost O
forgotten O
, O
and O
so O
was O
spared O
the O
dangerous O
ordeal O
of O
flattery O
and O
indulgence O
to O
which O
Annie S-PERSON
had O
been O
subject O
| | O
and O
from O
being O
more O
violent O
and O
less O
agreeable O
than O
Cecil S-PERSON
, O
was O
not O
so O
frequently O
spoiled O
by O
her O
mother O
. O
They O
feared O
the O
poor O
child O
would O
have O
much O
to O
endure O
from O
her O
own O
temper O
, O
Annie's S-PERSON
overbearing O
insolence O
, O
and O
Lady O
Helen's S-PERSON
culpable O
indolence O
| | O
but O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
hoped O
, O
when O
she O
resided O
part O
of O
the B-DATE
year E-DATE
in O
London S-GPE
, O
as O
she O
felt O
she O
would O
very O
soon O
be O
called O
upon O
to O
do O
, O
to O
be O
enabled O
to O
rouse O
Grahame's S-PERSON
attention O
toward O
his O
youngest O
child O
, O
and O
prevail O
on O
him O
to O
relax O
in O
his O
sternness O
toward O
her O

and O
by O
taking O
notice O
of O
her O
continually O
herself O
, O
instill O
such O
feelings O
in O
her O
as O
would O
attract O
her O
toward O
her O
father O
, O
and O
so O
increase O
the O
happiness O
of O
both O
. O
Every O
visit O
of O
the O
Grahame S-PERSON
family O
to O
Moorlands S-LOC

she O
resolved O

study O
Lilla S-PERSON
well O

try O
all O
she O
could O

make O
one O
in O
reality O
so O
estimable O

as O
her O

happy O

in O
one S-CARDINAL
child O
at O

was O
quite O
satisfied O
that O

go O
to O
some O
of O
her O
most O
intimate O
friends O

when O
their O
coteries O
were O
very O

To O
poor O
Emmeline S-PERSON
these O
anticipations O
gave O
no O
pleasure O

hated O
the O
very O
thought O

firmly O
convinced O

intellectual O

nor O
the O
most O
delightful O
social O
enjoyment O
in O
London S-GPE

could O
equal O
the O
pure O
delights O
of O
Devonshire S-GPE
and O
home O

Ellen S-PERSON
seemed O
too O
engrossed O
with O
her O
own O
thoughts O
to O
evince O
a O
feeling O
either O
way O
, O
much O
to O
her O
aunt's O
regret O

as O
her O
constant O
quietness O
and O
seeming O
determined O
repression O
of O
her O
sentiments O
, O
rendered O
her O
character O
still O
more O
difficult O
to O
read O
. O
But O
a O
heavy O
disappointment O
was O
preparing O
for O
Caroline S-PERSON

in O
the O
compelled O
postponement O
of O

bright O
anticipations O

to O
understand O
the O

that O

of O
life O
. O
There O
were O
some O
letters O
on O
the O
table O
this B-TIME
morning E-TIME
, O
so O
she O
had O
a O
longer O
time O
to O
drink O
in O
poetry O
than O
usual O
. O
" O
Who O
can O
offer O
Ellen S-PERSON
a O
more O
precious O
birthday O
- O
gift O
than O
mine O
? O
" O
exclaimed O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
playfully O
holding O
up O
a O
letter O
, O
as O
her O
niece O
entered O
. O
" O
I O
wonder O
if O
Edward S-PERSON
remembered O
how O
near O
his O
sister O
was O
to O
fifteen S-DATE
, O
and O
so O
wrote O
on O
the O
chance O
of O
your O
receiving O
it O
on O
the O
day O
itself O
! O
" O
" O
Why O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
what O
a O
queer O
effect O
pleasure O
has O
on O
you O
! O
I O
always O
notice O
you O
turn O
quite O
pale O
whenever O
Edward's S-PERSON
letters O
are O
given O
to O
you O
, O
" O
interposed O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
looking O
at O
her O
cousin O
, O
and O
laughing O
. O
" O
I O
am O
sure O
, O
the O
very O
hurry O
I O
am O
in O
to O
open O
Percy's O
and O
Herbert's O
, O
must O
give O
me O
a O
color O
, O
and O
you O
are O
as O
deliberate O
as O
if O
you O
did O
not O
care O
about O
it O
. O
I O
do O
wish O
you O
would O
not O
be O
so O
cold O
and O
quiet O
. O
" O
" O
One S-CARDINAL
giddy O
brain O
is O
quite O
enough O
in O
a O
house O
, O
" O
rejoined O
her O
father O
, O
in O
the O
same O
mirthful O
tone O
, O
and O
looking O
up O
from O
his O
letter O
he O
called O
Ellen S-PERSON
to O
him O
, O
and O
kissed O
her O
. O
" O
I O
forgot O
the O
day O
of O
the O
month O
, O
my O
little O
girl O
, O
but O
I O
am O
not O
too O
late O
, O
I O
hope O
, O
to O
say O
, O
God O
bless O
you O
, O
and O
wish O
that O
every O
year O
may O
pass O
more O
happily O
, O
more O
usefully O
, O
and O
more O
prepared O
for O
eternity O
than O
the O
last O
! O
" O
" O
I O
do O
not O
think O
you O
have O
forgotten O
it O
, O
my O
dear O
uncle O
, O
" O
replied O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
gratefully O
( O
she O
had O
not O
yet O
opened O
her O
brother's O
letter O
) O

" O
for O
my O
aunt O
says O
, O
I O
am O
to O
thank O
you O
as O
well O
as O
her O
for O
this O
beautiful O
birthday O
gift O
, O
" O
and O
she O
displayed O
an O
elegant O
little O
gold O
watch O

" O
indeed O
, O
I O
do O
not O
know O
how O
to O
thank O
you O
for O
all O
your O
kindness O
! O
" O
she O
added O
, O
so O
earnestly O
that O
tears O
came O
to O
her O
eyes O
. O
" O
I O
will O
say O
, O
as O
I O
have O
heard O
your O
aunt O
often O
say O
— O
by O
trying O
to O
be O
a O
little O
more O
lively O
, O
and O
unreserved O
, O
my O
dear O
Ellen S-PERSON

that O
would O
prove O
our O
kindness O
and O
affection O
made O
you O
happy O
, O
better O
than O
any O
thing O

but O
I O
am O
not O
going O
to O
lecture O
you O
on O
your O
birthday O
, O
and O
with O
a O
letter O
from O
Edward S-PERSON
in O
your O
hand O
, O
" O
he O
continued O
, O
smiling O
. O
" O
Open O
it O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
I O
want O
to O
know O
its O
date O

I O
rather O
think O
my O
friend O
Manly's S-PERSON
must O
be O
written O
later O
. O
" O
" O
Nothing O
in O
it O
for O
me O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
? O
" O
asked O
her O
aunt O
. O
" O
What O
a O
lazy O
boy O
he O
has O
grown O
! O
" O
" O
An O
inclosure O
for O
you O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON

why O
, O
that O
is O
as O
queer O
as O
your O
paleness O
! O
" O
said O
Emmeline S-PERSON
. O
" O
Do O
let O
your O
cousin's O
paleness O
alone O
, O
" O
interposed O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
gayly O
. O
" O
I O
really O
can O
not O
perceive O
she O
has O
any O
less O
color O
than O
usual O
, O
and O
as O
for O
the O
inclosure O
, O
Edward S-PERSON
often O
has O
something O
to O
add O
at O
the O
last O
moment O
, O
and O
no O
room O
to O
insert O
it O
, O
and O
so O
there O
is O
nothing O
remarkable O
in O
his O
using O
another O
half S-CARDINAL
sheet O
. O
" O
" O
Emmeline S-PERSON
always O
creates O
wonders O
out O
of O
shadows O
, O
" O
said O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
dryly O
. O
" O
And O
you O
never O
see O
any O
thing O
but O
dull O
, O
coarse O
, O
heavy O
realities O
, O
" O
laughed O
her O
sister O
in O
reply O
. O
" O
Come O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
tell O
us O
something O
of O
this O
idle O
brother O
of O
yours O
, O
who O
promised O
to O
write O
to O
me O
every O
packet O
, O
and O
never O
does O
. O
" O
Ellen S-PERSON
read O
nearly O
the O
whole O
letter O
aloud O
, O
and O
it O
was O
unusually O
entertaining O
, O
for O
the O
ship O
had O
been O
cruising O
about O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
month E-DATE
and O
Edward S-PERSON
described O
the O
various O
scenes O
and O
new O
places O
he O
had O
visited O
more O
lengthily O
than O
usual O
. O
He O
anticipated O
with O
great O
glee O
an O
engagement O
with O
some O
desperate O
pirates O
, O
whose O
track O
they O
were O
pursuing O
. O
" O
Does O
he O
mention O
an O
engagement O
? O
" O
inquired O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
. O
" O
No O
, O
uncle O
| | O
he O
concludes O
quite O
abruptly O
, O
saying O
they O
have O
just O
piped O
all O
hands O
, O
and O
he O
must O
be O
off O
. O
The O
direction O
does O
not O
seem O
his O
writing O
. O
" O
" O
Nor O
is O
it O
| | O
Sir O
Edward S-PERSON
sealed O
, O
directed O
, O
and O
put O
it O
up O
for O
him O
in O
his O
own O
to O
me O
. O
They O
had O
piped O
all O
hands O
, O
as O
he O
calls O
it O
, O
because O
the O
pirate O
ship O
was O
in O
sight O
, O
and O
an O
engagement O
did O
take O
place O
. O
" O
" O
And O
Edward S-PERSON
— O
oh O
, O
uncle O
, O
is O
he O
hurt O
? O
I O
am O
sure O
, O
he O
is O
, O
by O
your O
face O
, O
" O
exclaimed O
Ellen S-PERSON
| | O
trembling O
and O
all O
the O
little O
circle O
looked O
alarmed O
. O
" O
Then O
my O
face O
is O
a O
deceiver O
, O
" O
replied O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
quite O
cheerfully O
. O
" O
He O
only O
received O
a O
slight O
flesh O
wound O
in O
his O
right O
arm O
, O
which O
prevented O
his O
using O
it O
to O
complete O
his O
letter O
, O
and O
I O
rather O
think O
, O
he O
would O
have O
willingly O
been O
hurt O
still O
more O
, O
to O
receive O
such O
praises O
as O
Sir O
Edward S-PERSON
lavishes O
on O
him O
. O
Listen O
to O
what O
he O
says O
— O
' O
Not O
a O
boy O
or O
man O
on O
board O
distinguished O
himself O
more O
than O
your O
nephew O
: O
in O
fact O
, O
I O
am O
only O
astonished O
he O
escaped O
as O
he O
did O
, O
for O
those O
pirates O
are O
desperate O
fighters O
, O
and O
when O
we O
boarded O
them O
, O
Fortescue S-PERSON
was O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
them O
, O
fighting O
like O
a O
young O
lion O
. O
Courage O
and O
gallantry O
are O
such O
dazzling O
qualities O
in O
a O
young O
lad O
, O
that O
we O
think O
more O
of O
them O
perhaps O
than O
we O
ought O
, O
but O
I O
can O
not O
say O
too O
much O
for O
your O
nephew O
| | O
I O
have O
not O
a O
lad O
more O
devoted O
to O
his O
duty O
. O
I O
was O
glad O
to O
show O
him O
my O
approbation O
by O
giving O
him O
some O
days' O
liberty O
, O
when O
we O
were O
off O
New B-GPE
York E-GPE
| | O
but O
I O
have O
since O
told O
him O
, O
the O
air O
of O
land O
certainly O
did O
not O
agree O
with O
him O
, O
for O
he O
has O
looked O
paler O
and O
thinner O
ever O
since O
. O
He O
is O
growing O
very O
fast O
| | O
and O
altogether O
, O
if O
I O
have O
occasion O
to O
send O
another O
prize O
schooner O
home O
, O
I O
think O
it O
not O
improbable O
I O
shall O
nominate O
him O
as O
one O
of O
the O
officers O
, O
that O
he O
may O
have O
the O
benefit O
of O
the O
healthful O
breezes O
of O
Old B-GPE
England E-GPE
, O
to O
bring O
back O
his O
full O
strength O
. O
' O
There O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
I O
think O
that O
is O
a O
still O
better O
birthday O
- O
present O
than O
even O
Edward's S-PERSON
own O
letter O
. O
I O
am O
as O
proud O
of O
my O
nephew O
as O
Sir O
Edward S-PERSON
is O
. O
" O
" O
And O
do O
you O
think O
he O
really O
will O
come O
? O
" O
asked O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
trying O
to O
conquer O
her O
emotion O
. O
" O
We O
will O
hope O
it O
, O
dearest O
, O
" O
replied O
her O
aunt O
, O
kindly O
. O
" O
But O
do O
not O
think O
too O
much O
about O
it O
, O
even O
if O
Sir O
Edward S-PERSON
be O
not O
able O
to O
do O
as O
he O
says O
. O
His O
own O
ship O
will O
be O
coming O
home O
in O
a B-DATE
year I-DATE
or I-DATE
two E-DATE

and O
you O
owned O
to O
me O
yourself O
this B-TIME
morning E-TIME
, O
it O
did O
not O
seem O
as O
long O
as O
it O
really O
is O
, O
since O
our O
dear O
sailor O
left O
us O

so O
the O
remaining O
time O
will O
soon O
pass O
. O
Finish O
your O
breakfast O
, O
and O
go O
, O
love O
, O
and O
enjoy O
his O
letter O
again O
to O
yourself O
. O
" O
And O
Ellen S-PERSON
gladly O
obeyed O
| | O
for O
it O
was O
from O
no O
imaginary O
cause O
that O
the O
receipt O
of O
Edward's S-PERSON
letters O
so O
often O
paled O
her O
cheek O
, O
and O
parched O
her O
lip O
with O
terror O
. O
She O
knew O
that O
concerning O
him O
which O
none O
else O
but O
Harding S-PERSON
did O
| | O
and O
even O
when O
those O
letters O
imparted O
nothing O
but O
that O
which O
she O
could O
read O
to O
her O
family O
, O
the O
dread O
was O
quite O
enough O
to O
banish O
any O
thing O
like O
the O
elastic O
happiness O
, O
natural O
to O
her O
age O
, O
and O
called O
for O
by O
the O
kindness O
of O
those O
she O
loved O
. O
His O
letter O
this O
time O
, O
however O
, O
had O
not O
a O
word O
to O
call O
for O
that O
sickness O
of O
the O
heart O
, O
with O
which O
she O
had O
received O
it O
, O
and O
she O
read O
it O
again O
and O
again O
| | O
with O
a O
thankfulness O
, O
too O
intense O
for O
words O
. O
" O
You O
dropped O
this O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
dear O
, O
" O
said O
the O
voice O
of O
her O
cousin O
Emmeline S-PERSON
at O
her O
door O
, O
ten B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
after O
she O
left O
the O
breakfast O

room O

" O
It O

replied O
Ellen S-PERSON
as O
she O
looked O
at O
its O
length O
, O
not O
at O
its O
meaning O

for O
the O
fearful O
lesson O
of O
quiet O
unconcern O

the O
heart O

bursting O

Ellen S-PERSON
never O
moved O

Her O
brain O
felt O
scorched O

her O
limbs O
utterly O
powerless O

Every O
word O
seemed O
to O
write O
itself O
in O
letters O
of O
fire O
on O
her O
heart O

till O
she O
could O
almost O
have O
screamed O

from O
the O
dread O
agony O

then O
came O
the O
heavy O
weight O
, O
so O
often O
felt O
before O

never O
crushing O
every O

the O

indeed O

denying O
herself O
every O
little O

spending O
only O
what O

her O

all O

might O
have O
the O

it O

without O
exposing O
herself O

the B-DATE

fifteen B-MONEY

half S-CARDINAL

How O
was O
she O
to O
get O
the O
rest O

she O
had O
so O
buoyed O
herself O
with O
the O
fond O
hope O

that O
even O

she O
could O
send O
it O

him O
so O
easily O

now O
— O
her O
mind O
seemed O
actually O
to O
reel O
beneath O
the O
intense O
agony O
of O
these O
desperate O
words O

She O
was O
too O
young O
, O
too O
believing O

too O
terror O

stricken O
to O
doubt O

a O
moment O

placed O

Those O
words O

terrible O

almost O
awful O

one O

young O

a O
brief O
interval O
would O
have O
sufficiently O
calmed O
both O

it O
marvel O

from O

what O

Define O
why O
it O

be O
of O
less O

indeed O

by O
a O
deadly O
paleness O

fixed O
on O

beautiful O
scenery O

not O
seeing O
a O

confess O

all O
the O
old O

such O

Ellen S-PERSON

nerved O
herself O
to O

acknowledge O
she O
was O
thinking O

that O
it O
was O
very O
silly O

a O
slight O
wound O

when O
Mrs. O

walk O
over O

tell O

by O
such O
sleepless O

that O
Ellen S-PERSON
felt O

was O
only O
one S-CARDINAL

that O

Ellen S-PERSON

would O
apply O

her O
fearful O
state O
of O
mental O
agony O

to O
drink O

morning O

Ellen S-PERSON

had O
dressed O
for O

appeared O

every O
symptom O

such O
a O
violent O
headache O

her O
aunt O
advised O

quietly O

she O
assented O
with O
eagerness O

refusing O
every O

saying O
if O
the O
pain O

off O

it O
continued O

quietness O

Ellen S-PERSON
tried O
to O
promise O
that O
it O
should O

her O
tongue O
actually O
clove O
to O

all O

at O
the O

silence O
was O
unnoticed O

Mr. O

gave O
her O
his O

in O
half B-TIME

her O
whole O

shaking O
as O
with O
an O
ague O

" O

she O
said O
at O
length O
, O
and O
unlocking O
a O
drawer O
, O
took O
thence O
a O
small O
cross O
, O
and O
one S-CARDINAL
or O
two S-CARDINAL
other O
trinkets O

put O
them O
up O
, O
and O
taking O
off O
her O
watch O

looked O
at O
it O
with O
such O
an O
expression O
of O
suffering O

that O
it O
seemed O
as O
if O

could O
not O
go O
on O

carefully O
folded O
it O
up O
with O
the O
other O
trinkets O

And O
again O
she O
crouched O
down O
, O
cowed O
by O
that O
fearful O
struggle O
to O
the O
very O
earth O
. O
After O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes E-TIME
, O
it O
passed O
, O
and O
deliberately O
putting O
on O
her O
bonnet O

shawl O
, O
she O
took O
up O
her O
trinkets O
, O
and O
set O
off O
to O
the O
widow's O
cottage O
, O
her O
limbs O
so O
trembling O
, O
that O
she O
knew O
not O
how O
she O
should O
accomplish O
even O
that O
short O
walk O
. O
The O
wind O
was O
unusually O
high O
, O
although O
the O
day O
was O
otherwise O
lovely O
, O
and O
she O
was O
scarcely O
able O
to O
stand O
against O
the O
strong O
breeze O
, O
especially O
as O
every O
breath O
seemed O
to O
increase O
the O
pain O
in O
her O
temples O

but O
she O
persisted O
. O
The O
nearest O
path O
lay O
through O
a O
thick O
shrubbery O
, O
almost O
a O
wood O
, O
which O
the O
family O
never O
used O
, O
and O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
the O
younger O
members O
were O
prohibited O
from O
taking O
, O
but O
secrecy O
and O
haste O
were O
all O
which O
at O
that O
moment O
entered O
Ellen's S-PERSON
mind O
. O
She O
felt O
so O
exhausted O
by O
the O
wind O
blowing O
the O
branches O
and O
leaves O
noisily O
and O
confusedly O
around O
, O
that O
on O
reaching O
a O
sort O
of O
grassy O
glade O
, O
more O
open O
than O
her O
previous O
path O
, O
she O
sat O
down O
a O
minute O
on O
a O
mossy O
stone O
. O
The O
wind O
blew O
some O
withered O
sticks O
and O
leaves O
toward O
her O
, O
and O
, O
among O
them O
, O
two S-CARDINAL
or O
three S-CARDINAL
soiled O
pieces O
of O
thin O
paper O
, O
stained O
with O
damp O
, O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
which O
she O
raised O
mechanically O
, O
and O
started O
up O
with O
a O
wild O
cry O
, O
and O
seized O
the O
others O
almost O
unconsciously O
. O
She O
pressed O
her O
hands O
over O
her O
eyes O
, O
and O
her O
lips O
moved O
in O
the O
utterance O
of O
thanksgiving O

" O

not O
actually O
spoken O

were O
so O
distinctly O
uttered O

her O
heart O

she O
thought O

heard O
them O

retraced O
her O
steps O

so O
swiftly O

the O
very O
pain O

exhaustion O
were O
unfelt O
. O
She O
wrote O
for O
half B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour E-TIME
intently O
— O
eagerly O

though O
that O
which O
she O
wrote O
she O
knew O
not O
herself O
, O
and O
never O
could O
recall O

She O
took O
from O
the O
secret O
drawer O
of O
her O
desk O
( O
that O
secret O
drawer O

, O
when O
Percy S-PERSON
had O
so O
laughingly O
showed O
her O

little O

some O
bank O

two S-CARDINAL

three S-CARDINAL

five B-QUANTITY

each O

making O
the O
fifteen O
she O
had O
so O
carefully O
hoarded O
, O
and O
placed O
with O
them O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
she O
had O
found O
. O
As O
she O
did O
so O
, O
she O
discovered O
that O
two S-CARDINAL
had O
clung O
so O
closely O
together O
that O
the O
sum O
was O
five B-QUANTITY
pounds E-QUANTITY
more O
than O
she O
wanted O
. O
Still O
, O
as O
acting O
under O
the O
influence O
of O
some O
spell O
, O
she O
carelessly O
put O
one O
aside O
, O
sealed O
up O
the O
packet O
to O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
inclosed O
it O
in O
her O
uncle's O
to O
Sir O
Edward B-PERSON
Manly E-PERSON
, O
and O
dispatched O
it O
full O
four B-TIME
hours I-TIME
before I-TIME
the I-TIME
hour E-TIME
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
had O
named O
. O
It O
was O
gone O
| | O
and O
she O
sat O
down O
to O
breathe O
. O
Some O
impulse O
, O
never O
experienced O
before O
, O
urged O
her O
, O
instead O
of O
destroying O
Edward's S-PERSON
desperate O
letter O
, O
as O
she O
had O
done O
similar O
appeals O
, O
to O
retain O
it O
in O
a O
blank O
envelop O
in O
that O
same O
secret O
drawer O
. O
As O
she O
tried O
to O
rouse O
herself O
from O
a O
sort O
of O
stupor O
which O
was O
strangely O
creeping O
over O
her O
, O
her O
eye O
caught O
the O
five B-QUANTITY
pound E-QUANTITY
note O
which O
she O
had O
not O
had O
occasion O
to O
use O
, O
and O
a O
thought O
of O
such O
overwhelming O
wretchedness O
rushed O
upon O
her O
, O
as O
effectually O
, O
for O
the O
moment O
, O
to O
disperse O
that O
stupor O
, O
and O
prostrate O
her O
in O
an O
agony O
of O
supplication O
before O
her O
God O
. O
" O
What O
have O
I O
done O
? O
" O
— O
if O
her O
almost O
maddening O
thoughts O
could O
have O
found O
words O
, O
such O
they O
would O
have O
been O
— O
" O
How O
dared O
I O
appropriate O
that O
money O
, O
without O
one S-CARDINAL
question O

one O
thought O

it O

Oh O

Thy O
wrath O
must O
fall O
on O
a O
guilty O
one O

pour O
it O
on O
me O
, O

spare O
, O
spare O
my O
brother O
! O
I O
have O
sinned O

I O
meant O
it O

knew O
not O
what O
I O
did O
! O
Thou O
knowest O
, O
Thou O
alone O
canst O
know O

the O
only O
thought O
of O
that O
moment O

the O
agony O
of O
this O
. O
No O
suffering O
, O
no O
wrath O
, O
can O
be O
too O
great O
for O
me O

but O
, O
oh O
! O
spare O
him O
! O
" O
How O
long O
that O
withering O
agony O
lasted O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
knew O
not O
, O
nor O
whether O
her O
tears O
fell O
, O
or O
lay O
scorching O
her O
eyes O
and O
heart O
. O
The O
note O
lay O
before O
her O
like O
some O
hideous O
specter O
, O
from O
which O
she O
vainly O
tried O
to O
turn O
. O
What O
could O
she O
do O
with O
it O
? O
Take O
it O
back O
to O
the O
spot O
where O
the O
others O
had O
been O
blown O
to O
her O
? O
She O
tried O
to O
rise O
to O
do O
so O
| | O
but O
, O
to O
her O
own O
terror O
, O
she O
found O
she O
was O
so O
powerless O
, O
that O
she O
actually O
could O
not O
walk O
. O
With O
desperate O
calmness O
she O
placed O
it O
in O
the O
little O
secret O
drawer O
, O
put O
up O
the O
remainder O
of O
her O
papers O
, O
closed O
and O
locked O
her O
desk O
, O
and O
laid O
down O
upon O
her O
bed O
, O
for O
she O
could O
sit O
up O
no O
longer O
. O
Ellis S-PERSON
came O
to O
her O
with O
an O
inquiry O
after O
her O
head O
, O
and O
if O
she O
could O
take O
her O
dinner O
. O
Ellen S-PERSON
asked O
for O
a O
cup O
of O
coffee O
, O
and O
to O
be O
left O
quite O
quiet O
instead O
, O
as O
writing O
had O
not O
decreased O
the O
pain O
| | O
and O
the O
housekeeper O
, O
accustomed O
to O
such O
casual O
attacks O
, O
did O
as O
she O
was O
requested O
, O
and O
came O
frequently O
to O
see O
her O
in O
the O
course O
of O
the O
afternoon O
and O
evening S-TIME
| | O
still O
without O
perceiving O
any O
thing O
unusual O
, O
and O
, O
therefore O
, O
not O
tormenting O
her O
with O
any O
expression O
of O
surprise O
or O
anxiety O
. O
Thought O
after O
thought O
congregated O
in O
the O
poor O
girl's O
mind O
, O
as O
she O
thus O
lay O
| | O
so O
fraught O
with O
agony O
that O
the O
physical O
suffering O
, O
which O
was O
far O
more O
than O
usual O
, O
was O
unfelt O
, O
save O
in O
its O
paralyzing O
effect O
on O
every O
limb O
. O
Her O
impulse O
was O
to O
confess O
exactly O
what O
she O
had O
done O
to O
her O
aunt O
, O
the O
moment O
she O
should O
see O
her O
, O
and O
conjure O
her O
to O
sentence O
her O
to O
some O
heavy O
chastisement O
, O
that O
must O
deaden O
her O
present O
agony O
| | O
but O
this O
was O
impossible O
without O
betraying O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
and O
nullifying O
for O
him O
the O
relief O
she O
had O
sent O
. O
How O
could O
she O
confess O
the O
sin O
, O
without O
the O
full O
confession O
of O
the O
use O
to O
which O
that O
money O
had O
been O
applied O
? O
Whose O
were O
the O
notes O
? O
They O
were O
stained O
with O
damp O
, O
as O
if O
they O
must O
have O
lain O
among O
those O
withered O
leaves O
some O
time O
| | O
and O
yet O
she O
had O
heard O
no O
inquiry O
made O
about O
them O
, O
as O
the O
loss O
of O
so O
large O
a O
sum O
would O
surely O
have O
demanded O
. O
The O
only O
plan O
she O
could O
think O
of O
, O
as O
bringing O
the O
least O
hope O
of O
returning O
peace O
, O
was O
still O
to O
beseech O
Mrs. O
Langford S-PERSON
to O
dispose O
of O
her O
watch O
and O
trinkets O
, O
and O
the O
very O
first S-ORDINAL
mention O
she O
heard O
made O
of O
the O
loss O
to O
return O
the O
full O
sum O
to O
the O
real O
possessor O
, O
if O
possible O
, O
so O
secretly O
as O
for O
it O
not O
to O
be O
traced O
to O
herself O
. O
She O
thought O
, O
too O
, O
that O
if O
she O
gave O
her O
trinkets O
, O
one S-CARDINAL
by O
one O
, O
not O
all O
together O
, O
to O
Mrs. O
Langford S-PERSON
, O
it O
would O
be O
less O
suspicious O
, O
and O
, O
perhaps O
, O
more O
easily O
prevail O
on O
her O
to O
grant O
her O
secrecy O
and O
assistance O
| | O
and O
if O
she O
positively O
refused O
, O
unless O
Ellen S-PERSON
revealed O
the O
reason O
of O
her O
desiring O
their O
disposal O
, O
and O
would O
solemnly O
promise O
secrecy O
, O
she O
would O
tell O
her O
so O
much O
of O
her O
intense O
misery O
, O
as O
might O
perhaps O
induce O
her O
to O
give O
her O
aid O
. O
If O
she O
did O
not O
demand O
the O
reason O
and O
betrayed O
her O
, O
she O
must O
endure O
the O
doubt O
and O
serious O
displeasure O
such O
a O
course O
of O
acting O
on O
her O
part O
would O
inevitably O
produce O
| | O
but O
two S-CARDINAL
things O
alone O
stood O
clear O
before O
her O
: O
she O
must O
replace O
that O
money O
— O
she O
must O
keep O
Edward's S-PERSON
secret O
. O
She O
would O
have O
gone O
that O
very O
day O
to O
Mrs. O
Langford S-PERSON
, O
but O
she O
could O
not O
move O
, O
and O
Ellis S-PERSON
, O
at O
seven B-TIME
o'clock E-TIME
, O
prevailed O
on O
her O
to O
undress O
and O
go O
to O
bed O
. O
" O
Not O
better O
, O
my O
Ellen S-PERSON
? O
I O
hoped O
to O
- O
day's O
perfect O
quietness O
would O
have O
removed O
your O
headache O
, O
and O
am O
quite O
disappointed O
, O
" O
was O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
affectionate O
address O
, O
as O
she O
softly O
entered O
her O
niece's O
room O
, O
on O
the O
return O
of O
the O
happy O
party O
at O
eleven B-TIME
at I-TIME
night E-TIME
, O
and O
placing O
the O
lamp O
so O
that O
the O
bed O
remained O
in O
shade O
she O
could O
not O
see O
any O
expression O
in O
Ellen's S-PERSON
face O
, O
except O
that O
of O
suffering O
, O
which O
she O
naturally O
attributed O
to O
physical O
pain O

hot O
your O
hands O

day O

obliged O
to O

Mr. O
Maitland's S-PERSON

doctor O

I O
am O
sure O

tired O

But O
Ellen S-PERSON
would O
not O
hear O
of O
it O

the O
pain O
was O
not O
more O
than O
she O
was O
often O
accustomed O
to O
, O
she O
said O
, O
and O
, O
indeed O
, O
she O
did O
not O
mind O
being O
alone O
— O
though O
the O
unusual O
, O
almost O
passionate O
, O
warmth O
with O
which O
she O
returned O
Mrs. O

no O
indifference O

dictated O

It O
was O
well O
Mrs. O

, O
though O
anxious O
enough O
to O
feel O
the O
inclination O
to O
do O
so O

did O
not O
visit O
her O
niece O
again O

convulsive O
agony O

the O
choking O

burst O
forth O

a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes E-TIME
after O
she O
disappeared O
from O

CHAPTER O
III O
. O
A O
SUMMONS O
AND O
A O
LOSS O
. O
Mr. O
Maitland S-PERSON
declared O
Ellen S-PERSON
to O
be O
ill O
of O
a O
nervous O
fever O
which O
for O
three B-DATE
days E-DATE
confined O
her O
to O
her O
bed O
, O
and O
left O
her O
very O
weak O
for O
some O
little O
time O
, O
and O
so O
nervous O
that O
the O
least O
thing O
seemed O
to O
startle O
her O
| | O
but O
, O
as O
he O
said O
it O
was O
no O
consequence O
, O
and O
she O
would O
soon O
recover O
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
adopted O
his O
advice O
, O
took O
no O
notice O
of O
it O
, O
and O
only O
endeavored O
to O
make O
her O
niece's O
daily O
routine O
as O
varied O
in O
employment O
, O
though O
regular O
in O
hours O
and O
undisturbed O
in O
quiet O
, O
as O
she O
could O
. O
Perhaps O
she O
would O
have O
felt O
more O
anxious O
, O
and O
discovered O
something O
not O
quite O
usual O
in O
Ellen's S-PERSON
manner O
, O
if O
her O
thoughts O
had O
not O
been O
painfully O
pre-occupied O
. O
About B-DATE
a I-DATE
week E-DATE
after O
their O
excursion O
she O
entered O
the O
library O
earlier O
than O
usual O
, O
and O
found O
her O
husband O
intently O
engaged O
with O
some O
dispatches O
just O
received O
. O
She O
saw O
he O
was O
more O
than O
ordinarily O
disturbed O
, O
and O
hesitated O
a O
moment O
whether O
to O
address O
him O
| | O
but O
he O
was O
seldom O
so O
engrossed O
as O
to O
be O
unconscious O
of O
the O
presence O
of O

crowded O
upon O

that O

states O

too O

that O

the O

Emmeline's O
burst O
of O
sorrow O
was O
violent O
and O
uncontrolled O
. O
Caroline S-PERSON
looked O
for O
a O
minute O
quite O
bewildered O
, O
and O
then O
hastening O
to O
her O
father O
threw O
one S-CARDINAL
arm O
round O
his O
neck O
, O
exclaiming O
, O
in O
a O
voice O
of O
the O
most O
affectionate O
sincerity O
, O
" O
Dear O
papa O
, O
what O
shall O
we O
do O
without O
you O
for O
such O
a O
long O
time O
? O
" O
" O
My O
dear O
child O
! O
I O
thank O
you O
for O
such O
an O
affectionate O
thought O

believe O
me O
, O
the O
idea O
of O
your O
wishes O
being O
postponed O
has O
pained O
me O
as O
much O
as O
any O
thing O
else O
in O
this O
unpleasant O
duty O

My O
wishes O

what O
do O
you O
mean O
? O
" O

you O
quite O
forgotten O
our O
intended O

next B-DATE

my O
love O

My O
absence O

alter O
them O

" O
For O
a O
moment O
an O
expression O
of O
bitter O
disappointment O
clouded O
Caroline's S-PERSON
open O
countenance O
. O
" O
Indeed O
, O
papa O
, O
I O
had O
forgotten O
it O

I O
only O
thought O
of O
your O
going O
away O
for O
so B-DATE
many I-DATE
months E-DATE
. O
It O
is O
a O
great O
disappointment O
, O
I O
own O
, O
and O
I O
dare O
say O
I O
shall O
feel O
it O
still O
more O
when O
January S-DATE
comes O
| | O
but O
I O
am O
sure O
parting O
from O
you O
must O
be O
a O
still O
greater O
trial O
to O
mamma O
, O
than O
any O
such O
disappointment O
ought O
to O
be O
to O
me O

and O
, O
indeed O
, O
I O
will O
try O
and O
bear O
it O
as O
uncomplainingly O
and O
cheerfully O
as O
she O
does O
. O
" O
Her O
father O
almost O
involuntarily O
drew O
her O
to O
his O
heart O
, O
and O
kissed O
her O
two S-CARDINAL
or O
three S-CARDINAL
times O
, O
without O
speaking O
| | O
and O
Caroline S-PERSON
was O
very O
glad O
he O
did O
so O
, O
for O
when O
she O
looked O
up O
again O
, O
the O
tears O
that O
would O
come O
at O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
thought O
of O
her O
disappointment O
were O
bravely O
sent O
back O
again O
| | O
and O
she O
tried O
to O
cheer O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
by O
assuring O
her O
she O
never O
could O
be O
like O
her O
favorite O
heroines O
of O
romance O
, O
if O
she O
behaved O
so O
very O
much O
like O
a O
child O
| | O
taking O
the O
opportunity O
when O
they O
retired O
for O
the O
night O
, O
to O
say O
more O
seriously O
— O
" O
Dear O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
do O
try O
and O
be O
as O
lively O
as O
you O
always O
are O
. O
I O
am O
sure O
poor O
mamma O
is O
suffering O
very O
much O
at O
the O
idea O
of O
papa's O
leaving O
us O
, O
though O
she O
will O
not O
let O
us O
see O
that O
she O
does O
, O
and O
if O
you O
give O
way O
so O
, O
it O
will O
make O
her O
more O
uncomfortable O
still O
. O
" O
Emmeline S-PERSON
promised O
to O
try O
| | O
but O
her O
disposition O
, O
quite O
as O
susceptible O
to O
sorrow O
as O
to O
joy O
, O
and O
not O
nearly O
as O
firm O
as O
her O
sister's O
, O
rendered O
the O
promise O
very O
difficult O
to O
fulfill O
. O
It O
was O
her O
first S-ORDINAL
sorrow O
| | O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
watched O
her O
with O
some O
anxiety O
, O
half O
fearful O
that O
she O
had O
been O
wrong O
to O
shield O
her O
so O
carefully O
from O
any O
thing O
like O
grief O
, O
if O
, O
when O
it O
came O
, O
she O
should O
prove O
unequal O
to O
its O
firm O
and O
uncomplaining O
endurance O
. O
Ellen S-PERSON
had O
been O
out O
of O
the O
room O
when O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
had O
first S-ORDINAL
spoken O
| | O
and O
engaged O
in O
soothing O
Emmeline S-PERSON
| | O
when O
she O
re-entered O
and O
the O
news O
was O
communicated O
to O
her O
, O
he O
did O
not O
observe O
any O
thing O
particular O
in O
mode O
of O
receiving O
it O
. O
But O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
was O
so O
struck O
with O
" O
the O
expression O
of O
her O
countenance O
, O
which O
, O
as O
she O
tried O
somewhat O
incoherently O
to O
utter O
regrets O
, O
took O
the O
place O
of O
its O
usual O
calm O
, O
that O
she O
looked O
at O
her O
several B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
in O
bewilderment O
| | O
but O
it O
passed O
again O
, O
so O
completely O
, O
that O
she O
was O
angry O
with O
herself O
for O
fancying O
any O
thing O
uncommon O
. O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
however O
, O
had O
remarked O
it O
too O
, O
and O
she O
could O
not O
help O
observing O
to O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
, O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
they O
were O
alone O
— O
" O
You O
will O
say O
I O
am O
always O
fancying O
something O
extraordinary O
, O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
| | O
but O
Ellen S-PERSON
certainly O
did O
look O
pleased O
last O
night O
, O
when O
mamma O
told O
her O
of O
papa's O
intended O
departure O
. O
" O
" O
The O
expression O
must O
have O
been O
something O
extraordinary O
for O
you O
to O
remark O
it O
at O
all O
, O
" O
replied O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON

" O
nobody O
but O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
whose O
penetration O
is O
out O
of O
the O
common O
, O
can O
ever O
read O
any O
thing O
on O
Ellen's S-PERSON
face O
. O
" O
" O
And O
it O
was O
for O
that O
very O
reason O
I O
looked O
again O
| | O
and O
mamma O
noticed O
it O
too O
, O
and O
was O
surprised O
, O
though O
she O
did O
not O
say O
any O
thing O
. O
If O
she O
really O
be O
pleased O
, O
she O
is O
most O
ungrateful O
, O
and O
all O
her O
profession O
of O
feeling O
mamma O
and O
papa's O
constant O
kindness O
sheer O
deceit O
. O
I O
never O
shall O
understand O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
I O
believe O

but O
I O
do O
hope O
mamma O
will O
never O
discover O
that O
she O
is O
not O
exactly O
that O
which O
her O
affection O
believes O
her O
. O
" O
" O
Pray O
do O
not O
talk O
so O
, O
my O
dear O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
or O
I O
shall O
be O
tempted O
to O
confess O
that O
you O
are O
giving O
words O
to O
my O
own O
feelings O
. O
Her O
conduct O
with O
regard O
to O
the O
disappearance O
of O
her O
allowance O
, O
the O
wholly O
unsatisfactory O
account O
of O
its O
expenditure O
, O
even O
every O
month O
, O
for O
she O
seems O
to O
me O
to O
mention O
many O
things O
she O
has O
never O
had O
, O
banish O
every O
hopeful O
feeling O
, O

I O
dread O
more O
than O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
, O
the O
very O
thing O
you O
have O
expressed O
. O
But O
all O
this O
is O
very O
wrong O

we O
have O
relieved O
each O
other O
by O
a O
mutual O
acknowledgment O
, O

now O
let O
us O
never O
revert O
, O
even O
in O
thought O
, O
if O
possible O
, O
to O
the O
subject O

" O
Caroline S-PERSON
willingly O
acquiesced O
, O
for O
it O
was O
far O
from O
agreeable O
. O
Mr. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
preparations O
, O
meanwhile O
, O
rapidly O
progressed O

He O
imparted O
his O
wishes O

a O
companion O
willing O
to O
remain O
in O
the O
island O
, O
till O

him O
every O

next O
inquiry O

determining O
to O

all O

regular O
communication O

was O
regularly O
to O

bringing O
from O
the O

various O

it O
must O

a O
very O

are O
quite O
right O

testimony O

as O
rendered O
him O
the O
prime O
mover O
of O
all O
sports O
at O
Oxford S-ORG
, O
as O
he O
had O
been O
at O
Oakwood S-ORG
| | O
and O
Herbert S-PERSON
, O
though O
so O
gentle O
and O
retiring O
as O
( O
until O
Percy's S-PERSON
spirit O
was O
roused O
to O
shield O
him O
) O
, O
gained O
him O
many O
nick O
- O
names O
and O
many O
petty O
annoyances O
, O
silently O
and O
insensibly O
won O
his O
way O
, O
and O
so O
bore O
with O
the O
thoughtless O
, O
the O
mirthful O
, O
and O
even O
the O
faulty O
, O
as O
at O
length O
to O
gain O
him O
the O
privilege O
of O
being O
allowed O
to O
do O
just O
as O
he O
liked O
, O
and O
win O
by O
his O
extraordinary O
talents O
the O
admiration O
and O
love O
of O
all O
the O
professors O
with O
whom O
he O
was O
thrown O
. O
Morton S-PERSON
had O
promised O
to O
introduce O
a O
person O
to O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
on O
his O
return O
from O
Oxford S-GPE
, O
who O
, O
if O
approved O
of O
, O
would O
be O
his O
willing O
, O
his O
eager O
assistant O
, O
and O
gladly O
remain O
in O
the O
island O
, O
attending O
to O
all O
that O
was O
required O
in O
its O
superintendence O
, O
and O
in O
the O
education O
of O
young O
Wilson S-PERSON
, O
till O
he O
was O
old O
enough O
and O
properly O
fitted O
to O
take O
his O
father's O
place O
. O
Great O
, O
then O
, O
was O
Mr. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
disappointment O
, O
when O
Morton S-PERSON
entered O
his O
library O
according O
to O
appointment O
, O
but O
quite O
alone O
. O
Still O
greater O
was O
his O
astonishment O
, O
when O
he O
found O
it O
was O
Morton S-PERSON
himself O
, O
thus O
eagerly O
desirous O
to O
become O
his O
companion O
, O
urging O
his O
wishes O
, O
his O
motives O
, O
Mr. O
Howard's S-PERSON
sanction O
, O
with O
such O
earnestness O
, O
such O
single O
- O
mindedness O
of O
purpose O
, O
that O
every O
objection O
which O
, O
for O
Morton's S-PERSON
own O
sake O
, O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
so O
strenuously O
brought O
forward O
, O
was O
overruled O
| | O
and O
after O
a O
lengthened O
interview O
, O
matters O
were O
arranged O
to O
the O
entire O
satisfaction O
of O
both O
parties O
. O
The O
idea O
of O
the O
companionship O
and O
aid O
of O
such O
a O
friend O
as O
Morton S-PERSON
bringing O
as O
great O
a O
relief O
to O
both O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
as O
their O
acquiescence O
filled O
the O
whole O
heart O
of O
the O
young O
missionary O
with O
the O
most O
unbounded O
gratitude O
and O
joy O
. O
He O
suggested O
many O
little O
things O
, O
which O
, O
in O
the O
agitation O
of O
his O
hasty O
summons O
, O
had O
escaped O
his O
friends O
, O
and O
his O
whole O
being O
seemed O
transformed O
from O
despondency O
and O
listlessness O
to O
energy O
and O
hope O
. O
Engrossed O
as O
he O
was O
, O
Mr. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
usual O
thought O
for O
others O
had O
not O
deserted O
him O
, O
and O
he O
remarked O
that O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
his O
household O
, O
Robert B-PERSON
Langford E-PERSON
, O
so O
often O
mentioned O
, O
appeared O
to O
linger O
in O
the O
library O
after O
morning S-TIME
and O
evening S-TIME
service O
, O
as O
if O
anxious O
to O
speak O
to O
him O
, O
but O
failing O
in O
courage O
so O
to O
do O
. O
He O
thought O
, O
too O
, O
that O
the O
young O
man O
seemed O
quite O
altered O
, O
dispirited O
, O
gloomy O
, O
almost O
wretched O
at O
times O
, O
instead O
of O
the O
mirthful O
, O
happy O
being O
he O
had O
been O
before O
. O
Determining O
to O
give O
him O
an O
opportunity O
of O
speaking O
before O
his O
departure O
, O
if O
he O
wished O
it O
, O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
summoned O
him O
to O
arrange O
, O
write O
a O
list O
, O
and O
pack O
some O
books O
, O
which O
Morton S-PERSON
had O
selected O
to O
take O
with O
him O
. O
For O
some O
time O
Robert S-PERSON
pursued O
his O
work O
in O
persevering O
silence O
, O
but O
at O
length O
fixed O
his O
eyes O
on O
his O
master O
with O
such O
beseeching O
earnestness O
, O
that O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
inquired O
the O
matter O
at O
once O
. O
It O
was O
some O
time O
before O
the O
young O
man O
could O
sufficiently O
compose O
himself O
to O
speak O
with O
any O
coherency O
, O
but O
at O
last O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
gathered O
the O
following O
details O
. O
About B-DATE
five I-DATE
weeks E-DATE
previous O
( O
the B-DATE
first I-DATE
day I-DATE
of I-DATE
June E-DATE
) O
he O
had O
been O
introduced O
, O
as O
he O
had O
very O
often O
before O
been O
, O
by O
his O
master O
, O
with O
certain O
papers O
and O
law O
articles O
to O
convey O
to O
Plymouth S-GPE
, O
and O
with O
a O
pocket O
book O
containing O
thirty B-QUANTITY
pounds E-QUANTITY
, O
in O
two B-QUANTITY
ten I-QUANTITY
and I-QUANTITY
two I-QUANTITY
five I-QUANTITY
pound E-QUANTITY
notes O
, O
which O
he O
had O
orders O
to O
leave O
at O
some O
poor O
though O
respectable O
families O
, O
whom O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
was O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
occasionally O
assisting O
, O
though O
they O
were O
out O
of O
his O
own O
domains O
. O
The O
morning O
he O
was O
to O
have O
started O
on O
this O
expedition O
a O
cousin O
, O
whom O
he O
had O
always O
regarded O
as O
a O
brother O
, O
came O
unexpectedly O
to O
see O
him O
. O
He O
had O
just O
arrived O
at O
Plymouth S-GPE
from O
a O
four S-CARDINAL
years' O
residence O
with O
his O
regiment O
in O
Ireland S-GPE
: O
and O
Robert's S-PERSON
glee O
was O
so O
great O
as O
to O
require O
reiterated O
commands O
from O
the O
steward O
to O
take O
care O
of O
the O
papers O
, O
and O
not O
stay O
at O
his O
mother's O
cottage O
, O
where O
he O
was O
to O
take O
his O
cousin O
, O
later B-TIME
than I-TIME
the I-TIME
afternoon E-TIME
. O
He O
lingered O
so O
long O
before O
he O
set O
off O
from O
Oakwood S-GPE
, O
that O
he O
gathered O
up O
all O
the O
papers O
as O
quickly O
as O
he O
could O
, O
forgot O
his O
principal O
charge O
, O
so O
far O
at O
least O
as O
not O
to O
look O
to O
the O
secure O
fastening O
of O
the O
pocket O
- O
book O
, O
and O
hastened O
with O
his O
cousin O
through O
the O
brushwood O
and O
glade O
we O
have O
before O
mentioned O
, O
to O
his O
mother's O
cottage O
. O
It O
was O
very O
hot O
, O
and O
the O
young O
men O
, O
heated O
and O
in O
eager O
conversation O
, O
took O
off O
their O
coats O
, O
threw O
them O
loosely O
over O
their O
arms O
, O
and O
proceeded O
on O
their O
walk O
without O
them O
, O
much O
too O
engrossed O
with O
each O
other O
to O
be O
aware O
that O
, O
as O
they O
carried O
their O
coats O
, O
it O
was O
the O
easiest O
and O
most O
natural O
thing O
possible O
for O
all O
the O
smaller O
contents O
of O
their O
pockets O
to O
fall O
out O
, O
and O
if O
not O
missed O
directly O
, O
from O
the O
winding O
and O
rugged O
wood O
path O
, O
not O
likely O
to O
be O
found O
again O
. O
A O
draught O
of O
cider O
and O
half O
an O
hour's O
rest O
at O
Mrs. O
Langford's S-PERSON
cottage O
sufficiently O
revived O
Robert S-PERSON
to O
resume O
his O
coat O
| | O
he O
satisfied O
himself O
that O
his O
packet O
of O
papers O
was O
secure O
, O
and O
, O
as O
he O
imagined O
from O
the O
feel O
of O
another O
pocket O
, O
the O
pocket O
- O
book O
also O
. O
What O
, O
then O
, O
was O
his O
consternation O
, O
when O
he O
approached O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
house O
at O
which O
he O
was O
to O
leave O
ten B-QUANTITY
pounds E-QUANTITY
of O
the O
money O
, O
about B-QUANTITY
twenty I-QUANTITY
miles E-QUANTITY
from O
Oakwood S-GPE
to O
discover O
that O
the O
pocket O
book O
was O
gone O
! O
and O
that O
which O
, O
by O
its O
feel O
, O
he O
believed O
to O
have O
been O
it O
, O
an O
old O
card O
- O
case O
, O
that O
his O
young O
master O
Percy S-PERSON
had O
laughingly O
thrown O
at O
him O
one B-DATE
day E-DATE
after O
failing O
in O
his O
endeavor O
to O
emblazon O
it O
, O
the O
sticky O
materials O
he O
had O
used O
causing O
it O
to O
adhere O
to O
whatever O
it O
touched O
, O
and O
so O
preserving O
it O
in O
Robert's O
pocket O
, O
when O
almost O
all O
the O
other O
things O
had O
fallen O
out O
. O
He O
racked O
his O
memory O
in O
vain O
as O
to O
what O
could O
have O
become O
of O
it O
, O
convinced O
that O
he O
had O
not O
left O
it O
at O
Oakwood S-ORG
, O
as O
he O
first S-ORDINAL
sincerely O
wished O
that O
he O
had O
. O
Two S-CARDINAL
or O
three S-CARDINAL
other O
things O
had O
also O
disappeared O
, O
and O
it O
suddenly O
flashed O
upon O
him O
, O
that O
when O
carrying O
his O
coat O
over O
his O
arm O
they O
must O
have O
fallen O
out O
. O
He O
cursed O
his O
thoughtlessness O
again O
and O
again O
, O
and O
would O
have O
retraced O
his O
steps O
immediately O
, O
but O
the O
papers O
with O
which O
he O
was O
intrusted O
had O
to O
be O
delivered O
at O
Plymouth S-GPE
by O
a B-TIME
certain I-TIME
hour E-TIME
, O
and O
he O
could O
not O
do O
it O
. O
The O
intense O
heat O
of O
the O
day O
gave O
place O
in O
the O
evening O
to O
a O
tremendous O
storm O
of O
thunder O
and O
lightning O
, O
wind O
and O
very O
heavy O
rain O
, O
which O
last O
continued O
unabated O
through O
the O
night O
. O
He O
returned O
home O
, O
or O
rather O
to O
his O
mother's O
cottage O
, O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
day E-DATE
, O
in O
a O
state O
of O
mind O
little O
removed O
from O
distraction O
| | O
searching O
the O
path O
he O
had O
traversed O
with O
his O
cousin O
in O
every O
direction O
, O
but O
only O
succeeded O
in O
finding O
some O
worthless O
trifles O
, O
and O
the O
pocket O
- O
book O
itself O
but O
open O
and O
empty O
| | O
but O
at O
a O
little O
distance O
from O
it O
one B-QUANTITY
five I-QUANTITY
pound E-QUANTITY
note O
. O
In O
an O
instant O
he O
remembered O
that O
in O
his O
hurry O
he O
had O
failed O
to O
see O
to O
its O
proper O
fastening O
: O
if O
he O
had O
, O
all O
would O
have O
been O
right O
, O
for O
the O
wind O
and O
rain O
would O
hardly O
have O
had O
power O
to O
open O
it O
, O
and O
disperse O
its O
contents O
. O
Hour B-TIME
after I-TIME
hour E-TIME
he O
passed O
in O
the O
vain O
search O
for O
the O
remainder O
| | O
the O
storm O
had O
rendered O
the O
path O
more O
intricate O
| | O
the O
ground O
was O
slimy O
, O
and O
quantities O
of O
dried O
sticks O
and O
broken O
branches O
and O
leaves O
almost O
covered O
it O
. O
He O
told O
his O
tale O
to O
his O
mother O
in O
the O
deepest O
distress O
| | O
what O
was O
he O
to O
do O
? O
She O
advised O
him O
to O
tell O
the O
steward O
the O
whole O
story O
, O
and O
to O
request O
him O
to O
keep O
back O
the O
sum O
she O
was O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
receiving O
quarterly S-DATE
, O
till O
the O
whole O
amount O
could O
be O
repaid O
. O
Robert S-PERSON
obeyed O
her O
, O
but O
with O
most O
painful O
reluctance O
, O
though O
even O
then O
he O
did O
not O
imagine O
all O
the O
misery O
his O
carelessness O
would O
entail O
upon O
him O
. O
Morris S-PERSON
, O
as O
was O
natural O
, O
was O
exceedingly O
displeased O
, O
and O
not O
only O
reproved O
him O
very O
severely O
, O
but O
let O
fall O
suspicions O
as O
to O
the O
truth O
of O
his O
story O
: O
he O
knew O
nothing O
of O
his O
cousin O
, O
he O
said O
, O
and O
could O
not O
say O
what O
company O
he O
might O
have O
been O
led O
into O
. O
If O
the O
notes O
had O
fallen O
out O
of O
his O
pocket O
during O
his O
walk O
, O
they O
must O
be O
found O
| | O
it O
was O
all O
nonsense O
that O
the O
wind O
and O
rain O
could O
so O
have O
scattered O
and O
annihilated O
them O
, O
as O
to O
remove O
all O
trace O
of O
them O
. O
He O
would O
not O
say O
any O
thing O
to O
his O
master O
, O
because O
it O
would O
only O
annoy O
him O
, O
and O
the O
charities O
he O
would O
give O
himself O
, O
not O
from O
Mrs. O
Langford's S-PERSON
allowance O
, O
but O
from O
Robert's S-PERSON
own O
wages O

which O
he O
should O
certainly O
stop O
till O
the O
whole O
sum O
was O
paid O

he O
should O
take O
care O
how O
he O
intrusted O
such O
a O
responsible O
office O
to O
him O
again O
. O
Robert S-PERSON
was O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
indignant O
, O
and O
violent O
in O
his O
protestations O
of O
the O
truth O
of O
his O
story O
| | O
but O
as O
it O
got O
wind O
in O
the O
servants' O
hall O
as O
he O
found O
himself O
suspected O
and O
shunned O
by O
almost O
all O
, O
as O
days O
merged O
into O
weeks S-DATE
, O
and O
there O
was O
no O
trace O
of O
the O
notes O
, O
and O
Morris S-PERSON
and O
Ellis S-PERSON
both O
united O
in O
declaring O
that O
, O
as O
no O
strangers O
passed O
through O
that O
part O
of O
the O
park O
, O
if O
found O
they O
must O
have O
been O
heard O
of O
, O
the O
young O
man O
sunk O
into O
a O
state O
of O
the O
most O
gloomy O
despondency O
, O
longing O
to O
tell O
his O
kind O
master O
the O
whole O
tale O
, O
and O
yet O
, O
naturally O
enough O
, O
shrinking O
from O
the O
dread O
of O
his O
suspicion O
of O
his O
honesty O
, O
as O
more O
terrible O
than O
all O
the O
rest O
. O
But O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
did O
not O
suspect O
him O
, O
and O
so O
assured O
him O
of O
his O
firm O
belief O
in O
his O
truth O
and O
innocence O
, O
that O
it O
was O
with O
great O
difficulty O
poor O
Robert S-PERSON
refrained O
from O
throwing O
himself O
at O
his O
feet O
to O
pour O
forth O
his O
gratitude O
. O
He O
was O
so O
severely O
punished O
from O
his O
heedlessness O
, O
that O
his O
master O
would O
not O
say O
much O
about O
it O
, O
and O
soon O
after O
dismissing O
him O
, O
summoned O
Morris S-PERSON
, O
and O
talked O
with O
him O
some O
time O
on O
the O
subject O
, O
declaring O
he O
would O
as O
soon O
suspect O
his O
own O
son O
of O
dishonesty O
as O
the O
boy O
who O
had O
grown O
up O
under O
his O
own O
eye O
from O
infancy O
, O
and O
the O
son O
of O
such O
a O
mother O
. O
It O
was O
very O
distressing O
for O
Mrs. O
Langford S-PERSON
certainly O
, O
the O
old O
steward O
allowed O
, O
and O
she O
looked O
sad O
enough O
| | O
but O
it O
was O
no O
use O
, O
he O
had O
tried O
hard O
enough O
to O
prevent O
his O
suspicions O
, O
but O
they O
would O
come O
. O
None O
but O
the O
servants O
and O
the O
woodmen O
and O
gardeners O
went O
that O
path O
, O
and O
if O
the O
notes O
had O
been O
dropped O
there O
, O
they O
must O
have O
been O
found O
| | O
and O
it O
was O
a O
very O
hard O
thing O
for O
the O
other O
servants O
, O
as O
none O
knew O
who O
might O
be O
suspected O
of O
appropriating O
them O
. O
His O
master O
was O
much O
too O
kind O
in O
his O
opinions O
, O
but O
he O
must O
forgive O
him O
if O
he O
continued O
to O
keep O
a O
sharp O
look O
out O
after O
the O
young O
man O
. O
Morris S-PERSON
was O
very O
old O
, O
and O
somewhat O
opinionated O
| | O
so O
all O
that O
his O
master O
could O
succeed O
in O
, O
was O
to O
insist O
that O
he O
should O
only O
keep O
back O
half S-CARDINAL
of O
Robert's S-ORG
wages O
, O
till O
the O
sum O
was O
paid O
. O
" O
Take O
away O
the O
whole O
, O
and O
if O
he O
have O
been O
unfortunately O
led O
into O
temptation O
, O
which O
I O
do O
not O
believe O
he O
has O
, O
you O
expose O
him O
to O
it O
again O
, O
" O
was O
his O
judicious O
command O
. O
" O
It O
is O
all O
right O
he O
should O
return O
it O
, O
even O
though O
lost O
only O
by O
carelessness O
| | O
but O
I O
will O
not O
have O
him O
put O
to O
such O
straits O
for O
want O
of O
a O
little O
money O
, O
as O
must O
be O
the O
case O
if O
you O
deprive O
him O
of O
all O
his O
wages O
| | O
and O
now O
, O
my O
good O
Morris S-PERSON
, O
if O
you O
can O
not O
in O
conscience O
repeat O
my O
firm O
opinion O
of O
this O
lad's O
innocence O
to O
the O
servants O
, O
I O
must O
do O
it O
myself O
. O
" O
And O
that O
very O
evening O
after O
prayers O
, O
when O
the O
whole O
household O
were O
assembled O
in O
the O
library O
, O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
addressed O
them O
simply O
and O
briefly O
, O
mentioning O
that O
Robert B-PERSON
Langford E-PERSON
had O
himself O
told O
his O
tale O
to O
him O
, O
and O
that O
it O
was O
his O
own O
opinion O
, O
and O
that O
of O
their O
mistress O
, O
that O
he O
did O
not O
deserve O
the O
suspicions O
attached O
to O
him O
, O
and O
that O
his O
fellow O
- O
servants O
would O
all O
be O
acting O
more O
charitably O
and O
religiously O
if O
they O
believed O
his O
story O
, O
until O
they O
had O
had O
some O
strong O
proof O
to O
the O
contrary O
| | O
he O
could O
not O
of O
course O
, O
interfere O
with O
private O
opinion O
| | O
he O
could O
only O
tell O
them O
his O
own O
and O
their O
lady's O
. O
He O
acknowledged O
it O
was O
a O
very O
unpleasant O
occurrence O
, O
but O
he O
begged O
them O
all O
to O
dismiss O
the O
idea O
that O
suspicion O
could O
be O
attached O
to O
either O
of O
them O
| | O
he O
felt O
too O
convinced O
that O
had O
any O
one O
of O
his O
household O
chanced O
to O
find O
the O
missing O
notes O
, O
they O
would O
at O
once O
have O
mentioned O
it O
to O
the O
steward O
or O
housekeeper O
, O
more O
especially O
, O
since O
Robert's S-PERSON
loss O
had O
been O
known O
among O
them O
only B-DATE
a I-DATE
few I-DATE
days E-DATE
after O
it O
had O
occurred O
. O
Appropriation O
, O
he O
need O
not O
tell O
them O
, O
in O
such O
a O
case O
was O
theft O
, O
and O
of O
that O
sin O
, O
he O
was O
perfectly O
certain O
, O
not O
one O
present O
would O
be O
guilty O
. O
He O
allowed O
that O
it O
would O
be O
much O
more O
satisfactory O
to O
have O
the O
tangible O
proof O
of O
Robert's S-PERSON
innocence O
by O
discovering O
some O
trace O
of O
them O
but O
it O
was O
not O
unlikely O
the O
heavy O
wind O
and O
rain O
had O
destroyed O
the O
thin O
material O
of O
the O
notes O
or O
borne O
them O
into O
the O
brambly O
brushwood O
, O
where O
it O
was O
scarcely O
possible O
they O
could O
be O
found O
. O
If O
the O
attention O
of O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
her O
daughters O
, O
and O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
had O
not O
been O
naturally O
riveted O
on O
Mr. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
address O
, O
and O
its O
effect O
on O
the O
servants O
, O
especially O
Robert S-PERSON
, O
whose O
emotion O
was O
almost O
overpowering O
, O
they O
must O
have O
remarked O
that O
Ellen S-PERSON
had O
shrunk O
into O
the O
shade O
of O
the O
heavy O
curtains O
falling O
by O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
windows O
, O
and O
had O
unconsciously O
grasped O
the O
oaken O
back O
of O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
massive O
chairs O
| | O
lips O
, O
cheek O
, O
and O
brow O
, O
white O
and O
rigid O
as O
sculptured O
marble O
. O
An O
almost O
supernatural O
effort O
alone O
enabled O
her O
to O
master O
the O
crushing O
agony O
, O
sending O
the O
blood O
up O
to O
her O
cheeks O
with O
such O
returning O
violence O
, O
that O
when O
she O
wished O
her O
aunt O
and O
uncle O
good O
night O
, O
she O
might O
have O
been O
thought O
more O
flushed O
than O
pale O
| | O
but O
it O
passed O
unnoticed O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
too O
much O
annoyed O
on O
Mrs. O
Langford's S-PERSON
account O
, O
to O
think O
at O
that O
moment O
of O
any O
thing O
but O
how O
she O
could O
best O
set O
the O
poor O
mother's O
heart O
at O
rest O
. O
It O
was O
very O
evident O
that O
though O
some O
of O
the O
domestics O
after O
their O
master's O
address O
came O
up O
to O
Robert S-PERSON
, O
shook O
hands O
with O
him O
and O
begged O
his O
pardon O
, O
the O
greater O
number O
still O
sided O
with O
Morris S-PERSON
, O
and O
retained O
their O
own O
less O
favorable O
opinion O
, O
and O
she O
could O
well O
imagine O
what O
Mrs. O
Langford's S-PERSON
sufferings O
must O
be O
. O
It O
only O
wanted O
five B-DATE
days E-DATE
to O
that O
fixed O
for O
Mr. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
departure O
, O
wind O
permitting O
| | O
and O
there O
were O
so O
many O
things O
to O
think O
of O
and O
do O
for O
him O
, O
that O
his O
family O
could O
have O
little O
thought O
of O
any O
thing O
else O
| | O
but O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
assured O
her O
husband O
she O
would O
leave O
no O
means O
untried O
to O
prove O
Robert's S-PERSON
innocence O
. O
For O
nearly B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour E-TIME
that O
same O
night O
did O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
after O
her O
attendant O
had O
left O
her O
, O
sit O
crouched O
by O
the O
side O
of O
her O
bed O
as O
if O
some O
bolt O
had O
struck O
and O
withered O
her O
as O
she O
sat O
. O
One S-CARDINAL
word O
alone O
sounded O
and O
resounded O
in O
her O
ears O
| | O
she O
had O
known O
it O
, O
pronounced O
it O
to O
be O
such O
to O
herself O
numbers O
of O
times O
, O
but O
it O
had O
never O
mocked O
and O
maddened O
her O
as O
when O
spoken O
in O
her O
uncle's O
voice O
, O
and O
in O
his O
deepest O
, O
most O
expressive O
tone O
— O
" O
theft O
! O
" O
And O
she O
was O
the O
guilty O
one O
— O
and O
she O
must O
see O
the O
innocent O
bearing O
the O
penalty O
of O
her O
crime O
, O
suspicion O
, O
dislike O
, O
avoidance O
, O
for O
she O
dared O
not O
breathe O
the O
truth O
. O
Again O
came O
the O
wild O
, O
almost O
desperate O
, O
resolve O
to O
seek O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
that O
very O
moment O
, O
avow O
herself O
the O
criminal O
, O
implore O
her O
to O
take O
back O
every O
trinket O
belonging O
to O
her O
, O
to O
replace O
it O
, O
and O
do O
with O
her O
what O
she O
would O
. O
But O
if O
she O
did O
confess O
, O
and O
so O
draw O
attention O
to O
her O
, O
how O
could O
she O
keep O
her O
brother's O
secret O
? O
Could O
she O
have O
firmness O
to O
bear O
all O
, O
rather O
than O
betray O
it O
? O
What O
proof O
of O
her O
inward O
wretchedness O
and O
remorse O
could O
there O
be O
in O
the O
mere O
confession O
of O
appropriation O
, O
when O
the O
use O
to O
which O
she O
had O
applied O
that O
money O

all O
concerning O
it O
, O
even O
to O
the O
day O
it O
was O
found O
, O
must O
be O
withheld O

lest O
it O
should O
in O
any O
way O

connected O
with O
her O
letter O
to O
her O
brother O

must O
be O
silent O

the O
only O
prayer O
which O
, O
night O

morning O
, O
ay O
, O
almost O
every O
hour O

rose O

from O

young O
heart O

for O
death O

THE O

Without O
him O
Oakwood S-PERSON

strange O
indeed O
, O
but O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
all O
seemed O
determined O
to O
conquer O
the O
sadness O

anxiety O
, O
which O
the O
departure O
of O
one O
so O
beloved O

naturally O
occasioned O

Emmeline S-PERSON
was O
so O
unused O
to O
any O
thing O
like O
personal O
sorrow O
, O
that O
she O
rather O
seemed O
to O
luxuriate O

its O
indulgence O

her O

listless O

dispirited O

on O
the O
sofa O

" O
Indeed O

you O

both O

Emmeline S-PERSON

almost O
pettishly O

" O
Quite O

the O
extent O

you O

indulging O
it O

even O
if O
called O

you O

your O

cheerful O
self O

their O
sakes O

It O
is O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
you O
have O
ever O
given O
me O

to O
suspect O
you O

she O
repeated O
, O
her O
voice O
faltering O
, O
and O
her O
eyes O
filling O
fast O
with O
tears O

" O
I O

my O

if O
you O

not O
try O

shake O
off O
this O
depression O

we O
must O
believe O
you O

Your O
father's O
absence O

a O
still O
greater O
trial O
to O
Caroline S-PERSON

it O
is O
to O
you O

for O
it O
compels O
a O
very O
bitter O
disappointment O

well O
as O
the O
loss O
of O
his O
society O

has O
exerted O
herself O
more O

I O
ever O

her O

so O
proves O

more O

how O
much O
she O

less O

Emmeline S-PERSON

now O
fairly O
sobbing O

" O
No O

I O

your O

you O
like O

me O

sad O

changed O

you O
are O

" O
Emmeline S-PERSON
looked O
up O
in O
her O
face O
, O
for O
there O
was O
something O
in O
the O
tone O
that O
appealed O
to O
her O
better O
feelings O
at O
once O
. O
Throwing O
her O
arms O
round O
her O
, O
she O
sobbed O
— O

Dear O
mamma O
, O
do O
forgive O
me O

I O
see O
now O
I O
have O

very O
selfish O

very O
weak O

I O
never O

never O

firm O

you O

never O

be O
so O

I O
am O
quite O
sure O
you O
would O
not O
like O
to O
be O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
those O
weak O

selfish O
characters O

who O
lay O
all O
their O
faults O

all O
the O
mischief O
their O
faults O
produce O
, O
on O
a O
supposed O
impossibility O

become O

I O
know O
your O
disposition O
is O
naturally O
less O
strong O

firm O
than O
your O
sister's O
, O
but O
it O
is O
more O
elastic O
, O
and O
still O
more O
joyous O

and O
so O
had O
you O
not O
too O
weakly O
encouraged O
your O
very O
natural O
sorrow O
, O
you O
would O
have O
been O
enabled O
to O
throw O
it O
off O

in O
the O
comfort O
such O
an O
exertion O
would O
have O
brought O
to O
us O

fully O

yourself O

I O
shall O

quite O
satisfied O

I O
fear O
you O
will O
find O
it O
more O
difficult O

had O
you O
tried O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
days I-DATE
ago E-DATE
. O
Confess O
that O
I O
am O
right O

you O
not O
, O
after O
the B-DATE
first I-DATE
two I-DATE

three I-DATE
days E-DATE

feel O
that O
you O
could O
have O
been O
cheerful O
again O
, O
at O
least O
at O
times O
, O
but O
that O
you O
fancied O
you O
had O
not O
felt O
sorry O
enough O

so O
increased O
both O
sorrow O

anxiety O
by O
determinedly O
dwelling O
on O
them O
, O
instead O
of O
seeking O
some O
pursuit O
? O
" O
" O

shall O
I O
never O
be O
able O
to O
hide O
a O
feeling O
from O
you O

" O
answered O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
so O
astonished O
, O
that O
her O
tears O
half O
dried O
. O
" O

did O
not O
know O

so O
myself O

you O

it O

really O
did O

it O
very O
wrong O

" O
" O
I O
will O
answer O
your O
question O
by O
another O
, O
love O

Did O
you O
find O
such O
pertinacious O
indulgence O
of O
gloom O
, O
help O
you O
to O
bring O
the O
object O
of O
your O
regret O
and O
anxiety O
, O
and O
of O
your O
own O
grief O
before O
your O
Heavenly O
Father O
? O
" O
Emmeline S-PERSON
hesitated O
, O
but O
only O
for O
a O
minute O
, O
then O
answered O
, O
with O
a O
crimson O
blush O
— O
" O
No O
, O
mamma O
| | O
I O
could O
not O
pray O
to O
God O
to O
protect O
dear O
papa O
, O
or O
to O
give O
me O
His O
blessing O
, O
half O
as O
earnestly O
and O
believingly O
as O
when O
I O
was O
happier O

the O
more O
I O
indulged O
in O
gloomy O
thoughts O
, O
the O
more O
difficulty O
I O
had O
to O
turn O
them O
to O
prayer O
, O
and O
the O
last O
few O
days O
, O
I O
fear O
I O
have O
not O
even O
tried O
. O
" O
" O
Then O
, O
dearest O
, O
is O
it O
necessary O
for O
me O
to O
answer O
your O
former O
question O
? O
I O
see O
by O
that O
conscious O
look O
that O
it O
is O
not O
. O
You O
have O
always O
trusted O
my O
experience O
and O
affection O
, O
my O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
trust O
them O
now O
, O
and O
try O
my O
plan O
. O
Think O
of O
your O
dear O
father O
, O
whom O
you O
can O
not O
love O
too O
well O
, O
or O
whose O
compelled O
absence O
really O
regret O
too O
much O
| | O
but O
so O
think O
of O
him O
, O
as O
to O
pray O
continually O
in O
spirit O
to O
your O
gracious O
God O
, O
to O
have O
him O
always O
in O
His O
holy O
keeping O
, O
either O
on O
sea O
or O
land O
, O
in O
storm O
or O
calm O
, O
and O
so O
prosper O
his O
undertaking O
, O
as O
to O
permit O
his O
return O
to O
us O
still O
sooner O
than O
we O
at O
present O
expect O
. O
The O
very O
constant O
prayer O
for O
this O
, O
will O
make O
you O
rest O
secure O
and O
happy O
in O
the O
belief O
, O
that O
our O
God O
is O
with O
him O
wherever O
he O
is O
, O
as O
He O
is O
with O
us O
, O
and O
so O
give O
you O
cheerfulness O
and O
courage O
to O
attend O
to O
your O
daily O
duties O
, O
and O
conquer O
any O
thing O
like O
too O
selfish O
sorrow O
. O
Will O
you O
try O
this O
, O
love O
, O
even O
if O
it O
be O
more O
difficult O
now O
, O
than O
it O
would O
have O
been O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
days I-DATE
ago E-DATE
? O
" O
" O
I O
will O
indeed O
, O
mamma O
, O
" O
and O
she O
raised O
her O
head O
from O
her O
mother's O
shoulder O
, O
and O
tried O
to O
smile O
. O
" O
When O
you O
first S-ORDINAL
addressed O
me O
to O
- O
day O
, O
I O
thought O
you O
were O
almost O
harsh O
, O
and O
so O
cold O
— O
so O
you O
see O
even O
there O
I O
was O
thinking O
wrong O

now O
I O
am O
glad O

oh O
, O
so O
glad O
, O
you O
did O
speak O
to O
me O
! O

I O
know O
who O
will O
be O
glad O
too O

if O
I O
have O
prevented O
his O
having O
a O
Niobe S-PERSON
for O
his O
Tiny O
, O
instead O
of O
the O
Euphrosyne S-PERSON
, O
which O
I O
believe O
he O
sometimes O
calls O
you O
. O
I O
thought O
there O
was O
one S-CARDINAL
particular O
duet O
that O
Percy S-PERSON
is O
to O
be O
so O
charmed O
with O
, O
Emmy O

Suppose O
you O
try O
it O
now O

" O
And O
, O
her O
tears O
all O
checked O
, O
her O
most O
unusual O
gloom O
dispersed O
, O
Emmeline S-PERSON
obeyed O
with O
alacrity O
, O
and O
finding O
, O
when O
she O
had O
once O
begun O
, O
so O
many O
things O
to O
get O
perfect O
for O
the O
gratification O
of O
her O
brothers O

that O
nearly B-TIME
three I-TIME
hours E-TIME
slipped O
away O
quite O
unconsciously O

and O
when O
Caroline S-PERSON
returned O
from O
a O
walk O
, O
she O
was O
astonished O
at O
the O
change O
in O
her O
sister O
, O
and O
touched O
by O
the O
affectionate O
self O
- O
reproach O
with O
which O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
looking O
up O
in O
her O
face O
, O
exclaimed O
— O
" O
Dear O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
I O
have O
been O
so O
pettish O

so O
cross O
to O
you O
since O
papa O
left O
, O
that O
I O
am O
sure O
you O
must O
be O
quite O
tired O
of O
me O

but O
I O
am O
going O
to O
be O
really O
a O
heroine O
now O

not O
a O
shy O
sentimental O
one O

and O
bear O
the O
pain O
of O
papa's O
absence O
as O
bravely O
as O
you O
do O

" O
And O
she O
did O
so O

though O
at O
first O
it O
was O
, O
as O
her O
mother O
had O
warned O
her O

very O
difficult O
to O
compel O
the O
requisite O
exertion O

which O
for O
employment O

cheerfulness O

was O
now O
needed O

when O
the O
will O
is O
right O

there O
is O
little O
fear O

failure O

As O
each O

passed O

so O
quickly O
merging O
into O
weeks S-DATE

nearly B-DATE

take O
the O

the O
state O
of O
nervous O
debility O

after O
Mr. O

appeal O
to O
his O
domestics O

she O
had O
made O
a O
desperate O
attempt O

by O
asking O
permission O

the O
bearer O
of O
a O
message O
from O
her O
aunt O

as O
the O

were O
often O
allowed O

encouraged O
to O
visit O
their O
nurse O

the O
request O

won O
over O
to O
accede O

She O
was O
in O
most O
pressing O
want O
of O
money O
, O
she O
urged O
, O
and O
dared O
not O
appeal O
to O
her O
aunt O
. O
Not O
daring O
to O
say O
the O
whole O
amount O
which O
she O
so O
urgently O
required O
at O
once O
, O
she O
had O
only O
brought O
with O
her O
the O
antique O
gold O
cross O
and O
two S-CARDINAL
or O
three S-CARDINAL
smaller O
ornaments O
, O
which O
had O
been O
among O
her O
mother's O
trinkets O
, O
and O
a O
gold O
locket O
Percy S-PERSON
had O
given O
her O
. O
Mrs. O
Langford S-PERSON
was O
painfully O
startled O
. O
She O
had O
no O
idea O
her O
promise O
comprised O
acquiescence O
and O
assistance O
in O
any O
matter O
so O
very O
wrong O
and O
mysterious O
as O
this O

and O
she O
tried O
every O
argument O
, O
every O
persuasion O
, O
to O
prevail O
on O
Ellen S-PERSON
to O
confide O
all O
her O
difficulties O
to O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
urging O
that O
if O
even O
she O
had O
done O
wrong O
, O
it O
could O
only O
call O
for O
temporary O
displeasure O
, O
whereas O
the O
mischief O
of O
her O
present O
proceeding O
might O
never O
come O
to O
an O
end O
, O
and O
must O
be O
discovered O
at O
last O
| | O
but O
Ellen S-PERSON
was O
inexorable O
, O
though O
evidently O
quite O
as O
miserable O
as O
she O
was O
firm O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Langford S-PERSON
had O
too O
high O
an O
idea O
of O
the O
solemn O
nature O
of O
a O
pledged O
word O
to O
draw O
back O
, O
or O
think O
of O
betraying O
her O
. O
She O
said O
that O
, O
of O
course O
, O
it O
might O
be O
some B-DATE
weeks E-DATE
before O
she O
could O
succeed O
in O
disposing O
of O
them O
all O

as O
to O
offer O
them O
all O
together O
, O
or O
even O
at O
one S-CARDINAL
place O
, O
would O
be O
exposing O
herself O
to O
the O
most O
unpleasant O
suspicions O
. O
One S-CARDINAL
step O
was O
thus O
gained O
, O
but O
nearly B-DATE
a I-DATE
fortnight E-DATE
had O
passed O
, O
and O
she O
heard O
nothing O
from O
the O
widow O
. O
" O
Will O
they O
never O
come O
? O
" O
exclaimed O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
in O
mirthful O
impatience O
, O
one B-TIME
evening E-TIME
, O
about B-DATE
four I-DATE
days E-DATE
after O
her O
conversation O
with O
her O
mother O
| | O
" O
it O
must O
be O
past O
the O
hour O
Percy S-PERSON
named O
. O
" O
" O
It O
still O
wants O
half B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour E-TIME
, O
" O
replied O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
| | O
adding O
, O
" O
that O
unfortunate O
drawing O
, O
when O
will O
it O
succeed O
in O
obtaining O
your O
undivided O
attention O
? O
" O
" O
Certainly O
not O
this O
evening O
, O
mamma O

the O
only O
drawing O
I O
feel O
inclined O
for O
, O
is O
a O
sketch O
of O
my O
two S-CARDINAL
brothers O
, O
if O
they O
would O
only O
have O
the O
kindness O
to O
sit O
by O
me O
. O
" O
" O
Poor O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
" O
observed O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
dryly O
| | O
" O
if O
you O
are O
to O
be O
as O
restless O
as O
you O
have O
been O
the O
last O
hour O
, O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
he O
would O
not O
be O
very O
much O
flattered O
by O
his O
portrait O
. O
" O
" O
Now O
that O
is O
very O
spiteful O
of O
you O
, O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
and O
all O
because O
I O
do O
not O
happen O
to O
be O
so O
quiet O
and O
sober O
as O
you O
are O

though O
I O
am O
sure O
all O
this O
morning O
, O
that O
mamma O
thought O
by O
your O
unusually O
long O
absence O
that O
you O
were O
having O
a O
most O
persevering O
practice O
, O
you O
were O
only O
collecting O
all O
Percy's O
and O
Herbert's O
favorite O
songs O
and O
pieces O
, O
and O
playing O
them O
over O
, O
instead O
of O
your O
new O
music O
. O
" O
" O
And O
what O
if O
I O
did O
, O
Emmeline S-PERSON
? O
" O
" O
Why O
, O
it O
only O
proves O
that O
your O
thoughts O
are O
quite O
as O
much O
occupied O
by O
them O
as O
mine O
are O
, O
though O
you O
have O
so O
disagreeably O
read O

studied O
, O
worked O
, O
just O
as O
usual O
, O
to O
make O
one O

you O
neither O
thought O

cared O
any O
thing O
about O
them O

" O
And O
so O
, O
because O
Caroline S-PERSON
can O
control O
even O
joyous O
anticipation O
, O
she O
is O
to O
be O
thought O
void O

Emmy O

I O
really O
can O
pronounce O
no O
such O
judgment O

so O
, O

she O
may O
have O
settled O
to O
her O
usual O

you O
have O
literally O
done O
nothing O

all O

day O

will O
not O

" O
" O

idle O

unsteady O

brained O
girl O

replied O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
kneeling O
on O
the O
ottoman O
at O
her O
mother's O
feet O

looking O
archly O

fondly O
in O

me O

a O
fellow O

not O

condemnation O

Ellen S-PERSON

put O
away O
that O
everlasting O
sketch O

be O
idle O

too O

" O
" O
It O
won't O
do O
, O
Emmy S-PERSON

Ellen S-PERSON
has O
been O
so O
perseveringly O
industrious O
since O
her O
illness O
, O
that O
I O
should O
rather O
condemn O
her O
for O
too O
much O
application O
than O
too O
great O
idleness O
. O
But O
you O
really O
have O
been O
stooping O
too O
long O
this O
warm O
evening O
, O
my O
love O

" O
she O
added O
, O
observing O
, O
as O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
it O
seemed O
almost O
involuntarily O
, O
looked O
up O
at O
her O
cousin's O
words O
, O
that O
her O
cheeks O
were O
flushed O
almost O
painfully O

" O
Oblige O
Emmeline S-PERSON
this O
once O

idle O

talk O

scarcely O
heard O
a O
word O
from O
you O
to O
- O
day O

you O
have O
been O
more O
silent O
than O
ever O
, O
I O
think O
, O
since O
your O
uncle O
left O
us O

I O
must O

no O
gloom O

greet O
your O
cousins O

Ellen S-PERSON

" O
There O
was O
no O
rejoinder O
to O
these O
kind O
and O
playful O
words O
. O
Ellen S-PERSON
did O
indeed O
put O
aside O
her O
drawing O
, O
but O
instead O
of O
taking O
a O
seat O
near O
her O
aunt O
, O
which O
in O
former O
days O
she O
would O
have O
been O
only O
too O
happy O
to O
do O
, O
she O
walked O
to O
the O
farthest O
window O
, O
and O
ensconcing O
herself O
in O
its O
deep O
recess O

seemed O
determined O
to O
hold O
communion O
with O
no O
one O

Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON

so O
indignant O
as O
scarcely O
to O
be O
able O
to O
contain O
its O
expression O
. O
Caroline S-PERSON
looked O
astonished O
and O
provoked O
. O
Emmeline S-PERSON
was O
much O
too O
busy O
in O
flying O
from O
window O
to O
window O

to O
think O
of O
any O
thing O
else O

her O
brothers O

Mrs. O

was O
more O
grieved O

hurt O
than O
Ellen S-PERSON
had O
scarcely O
ever O
made O
her O
feel O

Several O
times O
before O
, O
in O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
month E-DATE

she O
had O
fancied O
there O
was O
something O
unusual O
in O
her O
manner O

the O
many O
anxieties O

thoughts O
which O
had O
engrossed O
her O
since O
her O
husband's O
summons O

his O
departure O

had O
prevented O
any O
thing O
, O
till O
that O
evening O
, O
but O
momentary O
surprise O
. O
Emmeline's S-PERSON
exclamation O
that O
she O
was O
quite O
sure O
she O
heard O
the O
trampling O
of O
horses O
, O

that O
it O
must O
be O
Percy S-PERSON

by O
the O
headlong O
way O

rode O

prevented O
any O
remark O

brought O
them O
all O
to O
the O
window O

she O
was O
right O

for O
in O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes E-TIME
a O
horseman O
emerged O
from O
some O
distant O
trees O
, O
urging O
his O
horse O
to O
its O
utmost O
speed O
, O
waving O
his O
cap O
in O
all O
sorts O
of O
mirthful O
gesticulations O
over O
his O
head O

long O
before O
he O
could O
be O
quite O
sure O

there O
was O
any O
body O

him O

Another B-TIME
minute E-TIME

he O
had O
flung O
the O
reins O
to O
Robert S-PERSON

with O
a O
laughing O
greeting O

springing O
up O
the O
long O
flight O
of O
steps O
in O
two S-CARDINAL
bounds O

was O
in O
the O
sitting O

room O

in O
the O
arms O
of O
his O
mother O

even O
time O

dismount O

" O
Herbert S-PERSON

" O
was O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
word O
Mrs. O

quivering O
lip O

well O

I O
left O
Bertie S-PERSON

play O

agreeable O

promised O
to O
see O
them O

morrow O

galloped O
on O
here O
, O
for O
you O
know O
the O
day O
we O
left O

I O
vowed O
that O
the O
firstborn O
of O

mother O
should O
have O
her O
first S-ORDINAL
kiss O

the O
same O
, O
Percy S-PERSON

not O
sobered O

boy O

said O
his O
mother O

looking O
at O
him O
with O
a O
proud O
smile O

for O

the O
tone O

manner O
were O
still O
the O
eager O

fresh O

feeling O
boy O

the O
face O

joyously O

alternately O
embraced O

to O
the O
inmates O
of O
Oakwood S-GPE

was O
real O
happiness O
to O
hear O
Percy's S-PERSON
wild O
laugh O
and O
his O
inexhaustible O
stories O
, O
calling O
forth O
the O

mirth O
from O
his O
hearers O

the O
very O
sound O
of O
his O
ever O

bounding O
step O

and O
his O
boisterous O
career O
from O
room O

to O

declared O

rouse O
all O
the O
bogies O

spirits O
that O
must O
have O
slept O

Herbert's S-PERSON
quieter O

interest O

even O
thought O

felt O

in O
his O
absence O
: O
the O
pride O

delight O
of O
both O
in O
the O
accounts O
of O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
Percy S-PERSON
insisting O
that O
to O
have O
such O
a O
gallant O
fellow O
of O

, O
ought O
to O
make O
Ellen S-PERSON
as O
lively O

happy O
as O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
blessed O
nearly O
in O
the O
same O
measure O
— O
looking O
so O
excessively O
mischievous O
as O
he O
spoke O
, O
that O
, O
though O
his O
sister O
did O
not O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
understand O
the O
inference O
, O
it O
was O
speedily O
discovered O
, O
and O
called O
for O
a O
laughing O
attack O
on O
his O
outrageous O
self O

conceit O
. O
Herbert S-PERSON
more O
earnestly O
regretted O
to O
see O
Ellen S-PERSON
looking O
as O
sad O
and O
pale O
as O
when O
she O
was O
quite O
a O
little O
girl O
, O
and O
took O
upon O
himself O
gently O
to O
reproach O
her O
for O
not O
being O
, O
or O
, O
at O
least O
, O
trying O
to O
make O
herself O
more O
cheerful O
, O
when O
she O
had O
so O
many O
blessings O
around O
her O
, O
and O
was O
so O
superlatively O
happy O
in O
having O
such O
a O
brave O
and O
noble O
- O
hearted O
brother O
. O
If O
he O
did O
not O
understand O
her O
manner O
as O
he O
spoke O
, O
both O
he O
and O
the O
less O
observant O
Percy S-PERSON
were O
destined O
to O
be O
still O
more O
puzzled O
and O
grieved O
as O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
weeks E-DATE
passed O
, O
and O
they O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
fancied O

then O
were O
quite O
sure O
that O
she O
was O
completely O
altered O

in O
her O
manner O

being O
so O
gentle O

so O
submissive O

so O
quietly O
happy O
to O
deserve O
the O
smallest O
sign O
of O
approval O
from O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
she O
now O
seemed O
completely O
to O
shrink O
from O
her O
, O
either O
in O
fear O
, O

that O
she O
no O
longer O
cared O
either O

to O
obey O
her O
. O
By O
imperceptible O
, O
but O
sure O
degrees O
, O
this O
painful O
conviction O
pressed O
itself O
on O
the O
minds O
of O
the O
whole O
party O
, O
even O
to O
the O
light O

hearted O

unsuspicious O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
to O
whom O
it O
was O
so O
utterly O
incomprehensible O
, O
that O
she O
declared O
it O
must O
be O
all O
fancy O
, O
and O
that O
they O
were O
all O
so O
happy O
that O
their O
heads O
must O
be O
a O
little O
turned O

dryly O

not O

" O
I O
do O
not O

both O
seen O

felt O
it O
before O
either O

that O

it O
so O
grieves O

perplexes O
her O

can O
not O
speculate O

even O
speak O
about O
it O

we O
do O

Time O
will O
explain O
it O

suppose O

it O
is O
very O
disagreeable O

little O
could O
these O
young O

suspect O
that O
which O
was O
matter O
of O
speculation O

grief O

was O
almost O
madness O

trifling O
returns O
for O

made O
her O
by O
Mrs. O

give O
back O
the O
missing O

Robert S-PERSON

without O
calling O
suspicion O
on O

She O
felt O
to O
herself O
as O
changed O
as O
she O
appeared O
to O
those O
that O
observed O
her O

black O
impenetrable O

so O
dear O

She O
longed O
for O
some O
change O
from O
the O
dense O
impenetrable O
fog O

even O
if O
it O
were O
some O
heavy O
blow O

tangible O

of O
the O
fiercest O

rather O

the O

such O
terror O

so O
loved O

that O
even O

banished O

imagined O

less O
agony O

the O
miserable O

Mrs. O

watched O

anxious O

she O
kept O
both O
her O
observations O

anxiety O

encountered O
near O
the B-LOC

them O

they O
hoped O
to O
reach O
Feroe S-PERSON
in O
another B-DATE
week E-DATE

He O
wrote O
in O
the O
highest O
terms O
of O
Morton S-PERSON

the O
comfort O
of O
such O
companionship O

the O
intrinsic O
worth O

could O
never O

ask O

" O
Nelly S-PERSON

me O

quite O
forgot O

dying O

see O
it O
all O
the O
time O
I O
have O

it O
me O
now O
, O
there's O
a O
dear O

it O
can O
not O
be O
much O
use O
to O
you O

that's O
certain O

for O
I O
have O
never O
seen O
you O
take O
it O
from O
its O
hiding O
- O
place O

" O
Ellen S-PERSON
answered O
, O
almost O
inarticulately O
, O
it O
was O
not O
in O
her O
power O

show O
it O
him O

" O
Not O
in O
your O
power O

as O
I O
think O
you O
are O
very O
often O

do O
you O

key O
for O

if O
you O

not O
your O

on O
too O
? O
" O
" O
Where O
is O
your O
watch O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
? O
and O
why O
, O
if O
you O
are O
not O
wearing O
it O
, O
do O
you O
make O
us O
suppose O
you O
are O

" O
interrupted O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
startled O
out O
of O
all O
idea O
that O
Ellen S-PERSON
was O
changed O
only O
in O
fancy O
. O
Ellen S-PERSON
was O
silent O
, O
and O
to O
Percy's S-PERSON
imagination O
, O
so O
sullenly O
and O
insolently O
so O
, O
that O
he O
became O
indignant O
. O
" O
Did O
you O
hear O
my O
mother O
speak O
to O
you O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
? O
Why O
don't O
you O
answer O
? O
" O
" O
Because O
I O
thought O
my O
watch O
was O
my O
own O

do O
what O
I O
liked O
with O
, O
to O
wear O
or O
to O
put O
away O

was O
the O
reply O

over O
neither O
words O
nor O
tone O
of O
which O
, O
had O
she O
at O
that O
moment O
any O
control O
, O
for O
in O
her O
agonized O
terror O
, O
she O
did O
not O
in O
the O
least O
know O
what O
she O
said O
. O
" O
How O
dare O
you O
answer O
so O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
? O
Leave O
the O
room O
, O
or O
ask O
my O
mother's O
pardon O
at O
once O

replied O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
his O
eyes O
flashing O
with O
such O
unusual O
anger O
that O
it O
terrified O
her O
still O
more O
, O
and O
under O
the O

kind O
of O
spell O
she O
was O
turning O
to O
obey O
him O
, O
without O
attempting O
the O
apology O
he O
demanded O
. O
" O
Stay O

Ellen S-PERSON

extraordinary O

what O
has O
come O
over O

can O
not O
imagine O

I O
never O
saw O
such O
an O
incomprehensible O
change O
in O
my O
life O
. O
" O
He O
departed O
, O
unconscious O
that O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
near O
the O
door O
transfixed O
at O
her O
aunt's O
words O
, O
made O
a O
rapid O
movement O
as O
to O
catch O
hold O
of O
his O
arm O
, O
and O
that O
the O
words O
, O
" O
Do O
not O
go O
, O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
for O
pity's O
sake O
! O

trembled O
on O
her O
pale O
lips O
, O

they O
emitted O
no O
sound O

What O
passed O
in O

interview O

lasted O
more B-TIME

an I-TIME

no O
one O
knew O

to O
the O
watchful O
eyes O
of O
her O
affectionate O
children O
, O
there O
were O
traces O
of O
very O
unusual O
disturbance O
on O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
expressive O
countenance O
when O
she O
rejoined O
them O

the O
dark O
rim O
round O
Ellen's S-PERSON
eyes O
, O
the O
deadly O
pallor O
of O
her O
cheeks O
and O
lips O
seemed O
to O
denote O
that O
it O
had O
not O
been O
deficient O
in O
suffering O
to O
her O

not O
one S-CARDINAL
sign O

penitence O

one S-CARDINAL
word O

acknowledgment O
that O

had O
been O
for O
some B-DATE
weeks E-DATE
in O
error O

by O
her O
extraordinary O
conduct O

her O

elicit O
. O
She O

never O

failed O

never O
, O
not O
even O
when O
the O
disappearance O
of O
her O
allowance O
had O
caused O
extreme O
displeasure O

had O
Ellen S-PERSON
evinced O
such O
an O
apparently O
sullen O
spirit O
of O
determined O
hardihood O

She O
would O
not O

defense O

the O
acted O
falsehood O

say O
what O
she O
had O
done O
with O
it O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
spoke O
to O
her O
till O
she O
was O
almost O
exhausted O
, O
for O
her O
own O
disappointment O
was O
most O
painful O

she O
had O
not O
a O
gleam O

hope O
to O
urge O
her O
on O

Her O
concluding O
words O
were O
these O
— O

It O
was O
nearing O
the B-DATE

of I-DATE
August E-DATE
, O
when O
one B-TIME
afternoon E-TIME
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
was O
prevented O
joining O
her O
children O
in O
a O
sail O
up O
the O
Dart S-PRODUCT
, O
though O
it O
had O
been O
a O
long O
promise O
, O
and O
Percy S-PERSON
was O
, O
in O
consequence O
, O
excessively O
indignant O
| | O
but O
certain O
matters O
relative O
to O
the O
steward's O
province O
demanded O
a O
reference O
to O
his O
mistress O
, O
and O
Morris S-PERSON
was O
compelled O
to O
request O
a O
longer O
interview O
than O
usual O
. O
Ellen S-PERSON
had O
chosen O
to O
join O
the O
aquatic O
party O
, O
a O
decision O
now O
so O
contrary O
to O
her O
usual O
habits O
, O
that O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
could O
not O
help O
fancying O
it O
was O
to O
prevent O
the O
chance O
of O
being O
any O
time O
alone O
with O
her O
. O
There O
had O
been O
no O
change O
in O
her O
manner O
, O
except O
a O
degree O
more O
care O
to O
control O
the O
disrespectful O
or O
pettish O
answer O
| | O
but O
nothing O
to O
give O
hope O
that O
the O
spirit O
was O
changing O
, O
and O
that O
the O
hidden O
error O
, O
whatever O
it O
might O
be O
, O
would O
be O
acknowledged O
and O
atoned O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
was O
nerving O
her O
own O
mind O
for O
the O
performance O
of O
the O
alternative O
she O
had O
placed O
before O
her O
niece O
| | O
passing O
many O
a O
sleepless O
night O
in O
painful O
meditations O
. O
If O
to O
send O
her O
from O
Oakwood S-GPE
were O
necessary O
, O
would O
it O
produce O
the O
effect O
she O
wished O
? O
with O
whom O
could O
she O
place O
her O
? O
and O
what O
satisfactory O
reason O
could O
she O
assign O
for O
doing O
so O
? O
She O
knew O
there O
would O
be O
a O
hundred S-CARDINAL
tongues O
to O
cry O
shame O
on O
her O
for O
sending O
her O
orphan O
niece O
from O
her O
roof O
, O
but O
that O
was O
but O
one O
scarcely O
- O
tasted O
bitter O
drop O
in O
the O
many O
other O
sources O
of O
anxiety O
. O
But O
still O
these O
were O
but O
her O
nightly O
sorrows O
| | O
she O
might O
have O
been O
paler O
when O
she O
rose O
, O
but O
though O
her O
children O
felt O
quite O
sure O
that O
Ellen S-PERSON
was O
grieving O
her O
exceedingly O
, O
her O
cheerful O
sympathy O
in O
their O
enjoyments O
and O
pursuits O
never O
waned O
for O
a O
moment O
. O
Morris S-PERSON
left O
her O
at O
six B-TIME
o'clock E-TIME
, O
all O
his O
business O
so O
satisfactorily O
accomplished O
, O
that O
the O
old O
man O
was O
quite O
happy O
, O
declaring O
to O
Ellis S-PERSON
, O
he O
had O
always O
thought O
his O
mistress O
unlike O
any O
one O
else O
before O
| | O
but O
such O
a O
clear O
head O
for O
reducing O
difficult O
accounts O
and O
tangled O
affairs O
to O
order O
, O
he O
had O
never O
imagined O
could O
either O
be O
possessed O
by O
, O
or O
was O
any O
business O
of O
a O
woman O
. O
Not O
in O
the O
least O
aware O
of O
the O
wondering O
admiration O
she O
had O
excited O
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
had O
called O
Robert S-PERSON
and O
proceeded O
to O
the O
school O
- O
room O
to O
get O
a O
pattern O
of O
embroidery O
and O
a O
note O
, O
which O
Caroline S-PERSON
had O
requested O
might O
be O
sent O
to O
Annie B-PERSON
Grahame E-PERSON
that O
evening O
| | O
the O
note O
was O
on O
the O
table O
, O
but O
the O
pattern O
and O
some O
silks O
she O
had O
neglected O
to O
put O
up O
till O
her O
brothers O
were O
ready O
, O
and O
they O
so O
hurried O
her O
, O
that O
her O
mother O
had O
promised O
she O
would O
see O
to O
it O
for O
her O
. O
The O
embroidery O
box O
was O
in O
a O
paneled O
closet O
of O
the O
school O
- O
room O
, O
rather O
high O
up O
, O
and O
in O
taking O
especial O
care O
to O
bring O
it O
safely O
down O
, O
Robert S-PERSON
loosened O
a O
desk O
from O
its O
equilibrium O
, O
and O
it O
fell O
to O
the O
ground O
with O
such O
force O
as O
to O
break O
into O
several O
pieces O
, O
and O
scatter O
all O
its O
contents O
over O
the O
floor O
. O
It O
was O
Ellen's S-PERSON
! O
the O
pretty O
rosewood O
desk O
which O
had O
been O
her O
gift O
, O
that O
memorable O
New B-EVENT
Year's I-EVENT
Eve E-EVENT
, O
and O
was O
now O
the O
repository O
of O
her O
dread O
secret O
. O
It O
was O
actually O
in O
fragments O
, O
especially O
where O
the O
ink O
- O
stands O
and O
pens O
had O
been O
, O
and O
the O
spring O
broken O
, O
the O
secret O
drawer O
burst O
open O
, O
and O
all O
its O
contents O
were O
disclosed O
. O
Robert S-PERSON
was O
much O
too O
concerned O
to O
think O
of O
any O
thing O
but O
his O
own O
extreme O
carelessness O
, O
and O
his O
mistress's O
reprimand O
| | O
and O
he O
busied O
himself O
in O
hastily O
picking O
up O
the O
contents O
, O
and O
placing O
them O
carefully O
on O
the O
table O
, O
preparatory O
to O
their O
arrangement O
by O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
in O
a O
drawer O
of O
the O
table O
which O
she O
was O
emptying O
for O
the O
purpose O
. O
She O
laid O
them O
carefully O
in O
, O
and O
was O
looking O
over O
a O
book O
of O
very O
nicely O
written O
French S-NORP
themes O
, O
glad O
there O
was O
at B-CARDINAL
least I-CARDINAL
one E-CARDINAL
thing O
for O
which O
she O
might O
be O
satisfied O
with O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
when O
an O
exclamation O
— O
" O
Why O
, O
there O
is O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
them O
! O
I O
am O
so O
glad O
, O
" O
and O
as O
sudden O
, O
a O
stop O
and O
half O
- O
checked O
groan O
from O
Robert S-PERSON
startled O
her O
. O
She O
looked O
inquiringly O
at O
him O
, O
but O
he O
only O
covered O
his O
face O
with O
one S-CARDINAL
hand O
, O
while O
the O
other O
remained O
quite O
unconsciously O
covering O
the O
secret O
drawer O
out O
of O
which O
the O
contents O
had O
not O
fallen O
, O
but O
were O
merely O
disclosed O
. O
" O
What O
is O
the O
matter O
, O
Robert S-PERSON
? O
what O
have O
you O
found O
to O
cause O
such O
contradictory O
exclamations O
? O
Speak O
, O
for O
God's O
sake O
! O
" O
escaped O
from O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
lips O
, O
for O
by O
that O
lightning O
touch O
of O
association O
, O
memory O
, O
thought O
, O
whatever O
it O
may O
be O
, O
which O
joins O
events O
together O
, O
and O
unites O
present O
with O
past O
, O
so O
that O
almost O
a O
life O
seems O
crowded O
in O
a O
moment O
, O
such O
a O
suspicion O
flashed O
upon O
her O
as O
to O
make O
her O
feel O
sick O
and O
giddy O
, O
and O
turn O
so O
unusually O
pale O
, O
as O
effectually O
to O
rouse O
Robert S-PERSON
, O
and O
make O
him O
spring O
up O
to O
get O
her O
a O
chair O
. O
" O
Nothing O

afternoon O

doing O
the O
most O
unheard O

frightening O

startled O

hesitated O

and O
Mrs. O

extended O
her O
hand O
to O
take O
them O
herself O

her O
hand O

arm O
so O
shook O

hide O
it O
from O
her O
domestic O

she O
let O
it O
quietly O
drop O
by O
her O
side O
, O
and O
repeated O
her O
command O
in O
a O
tone O
that O
brooked O
no O
farther O
delay O

He O
placed O
the O
little O
drawer O

its O
contents O
in O
her O
hand O

, O
without O
a O
word O

withdrew O

farthest O

awed O

It O
was O
nearly B-DATE
seven E-DATE
when O
the O
young O
party O
returned O
, O
delighted O
as O
usual O
with O
their O
afternoon's O
amusement O

and O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
shouting O
loudly O
for O
his O
mother O
, O
giving O
vent O
to O
an O
exclamation O
of O
impatience O
at O
finding O
she O
was O
still O
invisible O
. O
" O
I O
shall O
wish O
Morris S-PERSON

all O

" O
he O
said O
, O
as O
he O
flung O
himself O
full O
length O
on O
a O
couch O
in O
the O
music O
- O
room O
, O
desiring O
Emmeline S-PERSON
to O
make O
haste O
and O
disrobe O
, O
as O
he O
must O
have O
an O
air O
on O
the O
harp O
to O
soothe O
his O
troubled O
spirit O
. O
Herbert S-PERSON
, O
to O
look O
for O
a O
poem O
, O
the O
beauty O
of O
which O
he O
had O
been O
discussing O
with O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
during O
their O
sail O
, O
entered O
the O
library O
, O
but O
perceiving O
his O
mother O
, O
would O
have O
retreated O
, O
thinking O
her O
still O
engaged O
| | O
but O
she O
looked O
up O
as O
the O
door O
opened O
, O
and O
perceiving O
him O
, O
smiled O
, O
and O
asked O
him O
if O
they O
had O
had O
a O
pleasant O
afternoon O
. O
He O
looked O
at O
her O
earnestly O
, O
without O
making O
any O
reply O
| | O
then O
approaching O
her O
, O
took O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
her O
hands O
in O
his O
, O
and O
said O
, O
fondly O
— O
" O
Forgive O
me O
, O
dearest O
mother O

I O
ought O
not O

I O
am O
sure O
something O
is O
wrong O

nothing O

" O
Nothing O

my O
Herbert S-PERSON

bless O
you O
for O
your O
watchful O
love O
— O
it O
is O
such O
comfort O
. O
" O
And O
the O
long O
pressure O
of O
the O
hand O
which O
so O
warmly O
clasped O
hers O
, O
the O
involuntary O
tenderness O
with O
which O
these O
few O
words O
were O
said O
, O
betrayed O
how O
much O
she O
needed O
such O
comfort O
at O
that O
moment O
, O
but O
she O
rallied O
instantly O
. O
" O
Do O
not O
look O
so O
anxious O
, O
dear O
boy O
, O
I O
am O
not O

not O
quite O
happy O

perhaps O
, O

we O
know O
where O
to O
look O

trial O

eight B-TIME

may O

" O
and O
, O
satisfied O
that O
she O
did O
not O
wish O
to O
be O
more O
explicit O
, O
Herbert S-PERSON
took O
his O
book O
, O
and O
somewhat O
sorrowfully O
left O
her O

Ten B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
more O

the O
massive O
door O

again O

no O

A O

two S-CARDINAL

two S-CARDINAL

as O
evening O
advanced O

gave O
it O
that O
sort O
of O
soft O

holy O
light O

which O
always O
impresses O

spirit O

Mrs. O

oriel O
window O

the O

from O
which O
fell O
full O
on O
her O

giving O
her O
figure O
, O
though O
she O
was O
seated O
naturally O
enough O
in O
one O
of O
the O
large O

maroon O
velvet O

oaken O

an O
unusual O
effect O

dignity O

impressing O
the O
terrified O
beholder O
with O
such O
a O
sensation O
of O
awe O

that O
had O
her O
life O
depended O

it O

could O
not O

that O
one B-TIME

gone O
forward O

even O
when O
desired O
to O
do O
so O
by O
the O
words O
— O
" O
I O
desired O

— O
how O
she O
walked O
the O

that O
interminable O

stood O
facing O
her O

Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
for O
a B-TIME
full I-TIME

did O
not O
speak O

she O
fixed O
that O
searching O

once O

upon O

said O
, O
in O
a O
tone O
which O
, O
though O
very O
low O
and O
calm O
, O
expressed O
as O
much O
as O
that O
earnest O
look O
— O
" O
Ellen S-PERSON

it O

the O
fearful O
effects O

some O
unconfessed O

most O
heinous O
sin O

Little O
did O
I O
dream O
its O
nature O

" O
For O
a O
moment O
Ellen S-PERSON
stood O
as O
turned O
to O
stone O

as O
white O

rigid O
— O
the O
next O
she O
had O
sunk O
down O

with O
a O
wild O
, O
bitter O
cry O
at O
Mrs. O

buried O
her O
face O

" O
Yes O

with O
such O
a O

" O
Ellen S-PERSON
described O
the O
spot O

And O
what O
business O
had O
you O
there O

You O
know O

way O

you O

when O
was O
this O

— O
you O

remember O
the O

day O

Your O
memory O
is O
not O
in O
general O
so O
treacherous O

" O
Again O
Ellen S-PERSON
was O
silent O
. O
" O
Have O
you O
forgotten O
it O

" O
She O
crouched O
lower O
at O
her O
aunt's O
feet O
, O

the O
answer O
was O
audible O
— O

answer O
me O

Ellen S-PERSON

this O
moment O

distinctly O

for O

you O
seeking O

" O
" O
I O
wanted O
money O

my O
trinkets O

my O

as O
miserable O

I O
was O

the O

blew O
the O
notes O

my O
very O
hand O

I O
used O
them O

I O
have O
been O
mad O

have O
parted O
with O

time O

" O
To O
describe O
the O
tone O
of O
utter O
despair O

the O
recklessness O
as O
to O
the O
effect O
her O
words O
would O
produce O

impossible O

Every O
word O
increased O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
bewilderment O

misery O
. O
To O
suppose O
that O
Ellen S-PERSON
did O
not O
feel O
was O
folly O
. O
It O
was O
the O
very O
depth O
of O
wretchedness O
which O
was O
crushing O
her O
to O
the O
earth O
, O
but O
every O
answered O
and O
unanswered O
question O
but O
deepened O
the O
mystery O
, O

rendered O
her O
judge's O
task O
more O
difficult O
. O
" O
And O
when O
was O
this O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON

I O
will O
have O
no O
more O
evasion O

tell O
me O
the O

But O
she O
asked O
in O
vain O
. O
Ellen S-PERSON
remained O
moveless O
, O
and O
silent O
as O
the O
dead O
. O
After O
several B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
removed O
her O
hands O
from O
her O
face O
, O
and O
compelling O
her O
to O
lift O
up O
her O
head O

gazed O
searchingly O
on O
her O
deathlike O
countenance O
for O
some O
moments O
in O
utter O
silence O
, O
and O
then O
said O
, O
in O
a O
tone O
that O
Ellen S-PERSON
never O
in O
her O
life O
forgot O
— O
" O
You O
can O
not O
imagine O

either O
satisfy O
me O

your O
sin O

path O

open O
to O
you O

for O
all O
that O
you O
have O
said O
and O
left O
unsaid O
but O
deepens O
your O
apparent O
guilt O
, O
and O
so O
blackens O
your O
conduct O
, O
that O
I O
can O
scarcely O
believe O

am O
addressing O
the O
child O

loved O

that O

only O
be O
a O

Terrible O

is O
the O
guilt O

appropriating O
so O
large O

me O
have O
some O
hope O

publicly O
declaring O
you O

repeated O

, O
to O
conceal O
the O
emotion O
Ellen's S-PERSON
wild O
words O

, O
the O
large O
and O
lonely O
room O
, O
all O
added O
to O
that O
fearful O
illusion O
, O
and O
if O
Ellen S-PERSON
did O
succeed O
in O
praying O
, O
it O
was O
with O
desperate O
fervor O
, O
for O
strength O
not O
to O
betray O
her O
brother O
. O
If O
ever O
there O
were O
a O
martyr O
spirit O
, O
it O
was O
enshrined O
in O
that O
young O
, O
frail O
form O
. O
But O
how O
could O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
imagine O
this O
? O
How O
could O
her O
wildest O
fancy O
bring O
Edward S-PERSON
— O
the O
brave O
, O
happy O
, O
eager O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
of O
whom O
captain O
, O
officers O
, O
and O
crew O
wrote O
in O
such O
terms O
of O
praise O
and O
admiration O
, O
who O
had O
never O
given O
cause O
for O
anxiety O
, O
and O
who O
was O
so O
far O
distant O
— O
as O
the O
uniting O
link O
to O
this O
terrible O
mystery O
? O
Was O
it O
not O
more O
natural O
that O
he O
should O
not O
enter O
the O
incongruous O
and O
painful O
thoughts O
floating O
through O
her O
brain O
, O
save O
as O
her O
last O
resource O
, O
by O
his O
influence O
, O
to O
obtain O
the O
truth O
from O
Ellen S-PERSON
? O
The O
more O
she O
thought O
, O
the O
more O
agonizing O
her O
thoughts O
became O
| | O
what O
could O
induce O
this O
determined O
silence O
, O
but O
a O
conviction O
of O
deeper O
guilt O
, O
and O
what O
could O
that O
guilt O
be O
? O
The O
most O
terrible O
suspicions O
crossed O
her O
mind O
| | O
she O
had O
heard O
, O
though O
she O
had O
scarcely O
believed O
in O
them O
, O
of O
entanglements O
, O
even O
where O
the O
guardianship O
had O
been O
most O
rigid O
. O
Could O
one O
so O
young O
, O
seemingly O
so O
innocent O
, O
have O
fallen O
into O
the O
power O
of O
some O
desperate O
character O
, O
who O
was O
working O
on O
her O
thus O
? O
How O
could O
she O
be O
sure O
she O
intended O
to O
take O
her O
trinkets O
to O
Mrs. O
Langford S-PERSON
? O
Her O
choosing O
that O
forbidden O
path O
which O
was O
never O
by O
any O
chance O
trodden O
by O
the O
family O
or O
their O
friends O
, O
her O
constant O
desire O
lately O
not O
to O
join O
them O
in O
their O
excursions O
, O
preferring O
, O
and O
often O
finding O
some O
excuse O
to O
remain O
alone O
— O
all O
came O
to O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
mind O
, O
with O
such O
an O
overpowering O
sensation O
of O
dread O
and O
misery O
, O
that O
the O
worst O
guilt O
Ellen S-PERSON
could O
have O
avowed O
would O
scarcely O
have O
been O
worse O
than O
anticipation O
pictured O
| | O
and O
yet O
every O
thought O
was O
so O
vague O
, O
every O
fancy O
so O
undefined O
— O
there O
was O
nothing O
she O
could O
grasp O
at O
as O
a O
saving O
hope O
, O
or O
in O
the O
remotest O
degree O
excusing O
cause O
| | O
such O
obdurate O
silence O
in O
one O
so O
young O
, O
generally O
so O
yielding O
, O
could O
and O
must O
conceal O
nothing O
but O
still O
more O
fearful O
sin O
. O
The O
darkness O
which O
had O
gathered O
round O
them O
, O
save O
the O
brightening O
light O
of O
the O
harvest O
moon O
, O
suddenly O
awakened O
her O
to O
the O
lapse O
of O
time O
. O
The O
moonlight O
fell O
full O
on O
the O
face O
of O
the O
watch O
, O
which O
was O
a O
repeater O
. O
It O
wanted O
but O
three B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
more O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
watched O
the O
progress O
of O
the O
hand O
with O
such O
sickening O
dread O
, O
that O
when O
it O
reached O
the O
hour O
, O
she O
had O
scarcely O
strength O
to O
strike O
it O
, O
and O
so O
give O
notice O
— O
for O
words O
she O
had O
none O
— O
that O
the O
hour O
of O
grace O
had O
passed O
. O
But O
she O
conquered O
the O
powerlessness O
, O
and O
those O
soft O
chimes O
, O
which O
, O
when O
Ellen S-PERSON
first S-ORDINAL
came O
to O
Oakwood S-GPE
, O
had O
been O
such O
a O
constant O
source O
of O
childish O
wonder O
and O
delight O
, O
now O
rang O
in O
her O
ears O
louder O
, O
hoarser O
, O
more O
fearfully O
distinct O
, O
than O
even O
those O
of O
the O
ancient O
time O
- O
piece O
in O
the O
hall O
, O
which O
at O
the O
same O
moment O
rang O
out O
the B-TIME
hour I-TIME
of I-TIME
eight E-TIME
. O
The O
sound O
ceased O
, O
and O
with O
heightened O
dignity O
, O
but O
in O
perfect O
silence O
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
rose O
, O
passed O
her O
niece O
, O
and O
had O
nearly O
reached O
the O
door O
, O
when O
she O
paused O
, O
and O
turned O
toward O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
as O
if O
irresolute O
. O
Ellen's S-PERSON
eyes O
had O
watched O
her O
as O
in O
fascination O
, O
and O
the O
pause O
endowed O
her O
with O
just O
sufficient O
power O
to O
spring O
forward O
, O
fling O
herself O
at O
her O
aunt's O
feet O
, O
and O
clasping O
her O
knees O
with O
all O
her O
little O
remaining O
strength O
, O
passionately O
implore O
— O
" O
Aunt O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
aunt O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
speak O
to O
me O
but O
one O
word O
, O
only O
one S-CARDINAL
word O
of O
kindness O
before O
you O
go O

I O
do O
not O
ask O
for O
mercy O

there O
can O
be O
none O
for O
such O
a O
wretch O
as O
I O
am O

I O
will O
bear O
without O
one S-CARDINAL
complaint O
, O
one S-CARDINAL
murmur O
, O
all O
you O
may O
inflict O
— O
you O
can O
not O
be O
too O
severe O
. O
Nothing O
can O
be O
such O
agony O
as O
the O
utter O
loss O
of O
your O
affection O

I O
thought O
, O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
two I-DATE
months E-DATE

that O
I O
feared O
you O
so O
much O

it O
was O
all O
fear O

no O
love O

but O
now O
, O
now O
that O
you O
know O
my O
sin O
, O
it O
has O
all O
, O
all O
come O
back O
to O
make O
me O
still O
more O
wretched O
. O
" O
And O
before O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
could O
prevent O
, O
or O
was O
in O
the O
least O
aware O
of O
her O
intention O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
had O
obtained O
possession O
of O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
her O
hands O
, O
and O
was O
covering O
it O
with O
kisses O
, O
while O
her O
whole O
frame O
shook O
with O
those O
convulsed O
, O
but O
completely O
tearless O
sobs O
. O
" O
Will O
you O
confess O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON

if O
I O
stay O
? O
Will O
you O
give O
me O
the O
proof O
that O
it O
is O
such O
agony O
to O
lose O
my O
affection O

that O
you O
do O
love O
me O
as O
you O
profess O

that O
it O
is O
only O
one S-CARDINAL
sin O

has O
so O
changed O
you O

Ellen S-PERSON
made O
no O
answer O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
newly O
- O
raised O
hopes O
vanished O

she O
waited O
full O
two B-TIME

three I-TIME
minutes E-TIME

then O
gently O
disengaged O
her O
hand O

from O
Ellen's S-PERSON

convulsive O
grasp O

the O
door O
closed O

with O
a O
sullen O
, O
seemingly O
unwilling O
sound O

and O
Ellen S-PERSON
was O
alone O
. O
She O
remained O
in O
the O
same O
posture O
, O
the O
same O
spot O
, O
till O
a O
vague O
, O
cold O
terror O
so O
took O
possession O
of O
her O
, O
that O
the O
room O
seemed O
filled O
with O
ghostly O
shapes O
, O
and O
all O
the O
articles O
of O
furniture O
suddenly O
transformed O
to O
things O
of O
life O

springing O
up O
, O
with O
the O
wild O
, O
fleet O
step O
of O
fear O

she O
paused O
not O

she O
found O
herself O
in O
her O
own O
room O

where O
flinging O
herself O
on O
her O
bed O

she O
buried O
her O
face O
on O
her O
pillow O

shut O
out O
every O
object O
— O
oh O
, O
how O
she O
longed O
to O
shut O
out O
thought O
! O
It O
was O
such O
a O
different O
scene O
, O
such O
a O
fullness O
of O
innocent O
joy O
, O
on O
which O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
entered O
, O
that O
though O
she O
thought O
herself O
nerved O
to O
control O
all O
visible O
emotion O
, O
the O
contrast O
almost O
overpowered O
her O

knowing O
, O
too O
, O
that O
the O
fatal O
effects O
of O
one S-CARDINAL
person's O
sin O
must O
banish O
that O
innocent O
enjoyment O
, O
and O
would O
fall O
on O
them O
all O

some O
fearful O
, O
joy O

destroying O
blow O

The O
room O
, O
one O
of O
the O
least O
spacious O
, O
was O
cheerfully O
lighted O
, O
the O
urn O
hissing O
upon O
the O
table O
, O
at O
which O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
us O
usual O
, O
was O
presiding O

only O
waiting O
for O
her O
mother's O
appearance O
, O
to O
satisfy O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
loudly O
declaring O
he O
was O
famished O
in O
two S-CARDINAL
senses O
— O
for O
want O
of O
his O
mother's O
company O
, O
and O
of O
some O
restorative O
for O
his O
craving O
appetite O

He O
was O
lounging O
on O
the O
sofa O
, O
playing O
with O
Emmeline's O
flowing O
ringlets O
, O
as O
she O
sat O
on O
a O
low O
stool O
by O
his O
side O

chatting O
with O
him O
, O
in O
as O
discursive O
a O
strain O
as O
his O
fancy O
willed O
. O
Herbert S-PERSON
and O
Miss B-PERSON
Harcourt E-PERSON
were O
still O
in O
earnest O
discussion O
on O
their O
poem O
, O
from O
which O
Herbert S-PERSON
was O
occasionally O
reading O
aloud O
such O
beautiful O
passages O
, O
and O
with O
such O
richness O
of O
intonation O
, O
and O
variety O
of O
expression O
, O
that O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
and O
even O
Percy S-PERSON

Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
would O
pause O
involuntarily O
to O
listen O

" O
At O
length O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
springing O
up O
, O
as O
did O
Herbert S-PERSON
at O
the O
same O
moment O
, O
to O
get O
their O
mother O
a O
chair O
, O

place O
her O
comfortably O
as O
usual O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
them O

" O
Mother O
, O
I O
really O
did O
begin O

all O

night O

might O
have O
done O

her O
quiet O

even O
smiling O
reply O

assure O
you O

are O

the O
loss O

hunger O

owe O
Morris S-PERSON
a O
grudge O

will O
certainly O
serve O
him O
out O
one O
day O

detaining O

detained O

answered O
Mrs. O

, O
somewhat O
hurriedly O

elude O
farther O

perceiving O
at O
once O

expression O

animatedly O

each O
found O
so O
much O
to O
tell O
, O
and O
Percy S-PERSON
was O
in O
such O
wild O
spirits O
, O
that O
it O
was O
utterly O
impossible O
for O
there O
to O

a O
pause O

Tea O
had O
always O
been O
a O
favorite O
meal O
at O
Oakwood S-ORG
, O
as O
bringing O
all O
the O
family O
together O
after O
the O
various O
business O
of O
the O
day O

it O
continued O

They O
had O
lingered O
over O
it O

usual O
, O
when O
Caroline S-PERSON
suddenly O
exclaimed O
— O
" O
What O
has O
become O
of O
Ellen S-PERSON

quite O
forgotten O

no O
recollection O
of O
meal O

really O

we O
need O
not O
trouble O
ourselves O
about O
her O

" O
was O
Percy's S-PERSON

- O
jesting O
, O
half O
- O
earnest O
reply O
, O
for O
Ellen's S-PERSON

manner O
to O
his O
mother O

made O
him O
more O
angry O
with O
her O
, O
and O
for O
a O
longer O
time O
together O
, O
than O
he O
had O
ever O

any O
body O

stretched O
out O
his O
hand O
, O
however O
, O
to O
ring O
the O
bell O
, O

Mrs. O

stopped O
him O
. O
" O

your O
cousin O

not O

she O
said O

and O
her O
tone O
was O
now O
so O
expressive O
of O
almost O
anguish O
, O
that O
every O
one O
of O
that O
happy O
party O
startled O
and O
looked O
at O
her O
with O
the O
most O
unfeigned O
alarm O
, O
and O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
every O
thought O
of O
jest O
and O
joyousness O
checked O
, O
threw O
his O
arms O
round O
her O
, O
exclaiming O
— O
" O
Mother O
dearest O
! O
what O
has O
happened O
? O
— O
that O
unhappy O
girl O
again O

I O
am O
sure O
it O

Why O
do O
you O
not O
cast O
her O
off O
from O
your O
heart O
at O
once O

will O
bring O
you O
nothing O

sorrow O
for O
all O
your O
love O

" O
" O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
how O
can O
you O
be O
so O
harsh O
? O
— O
how O
unlike O
you O

" O
exclaimed O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
indignantly O
, O
as O

head O
, O
for O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes E-TIME
of O
natural O
weakness O
, O
sunk O
on O
her O
son's O
encircling O
arm O
. O
" O
We O

all O
given O
mamma O

too O

for O
shame O
! O
" O
" O
Hush O
! O
" O
answered O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
almost O
sternly O
, O
for O
there O
were O
times O
when O
he O
could O
quite O
throw O
off O
the O
boy O

" O
This O
is O
no O
light O

common O
matter O

. O
Shall O
we O
send O
for O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON

fondly O

ablest O
friend O

we O
can O
only O
feel O
, O
not O
counsel O

" O
But O
there O
are O
times O
when O
feeling O
can O
aid O
in O
bringing O
back O
control O
and O
strength O
, O
when O
counsel O
alone O
would O
seem O
so O
harsh O

cold O
, O
we O
can O
only O
weep O
before O
it O

and O
the O
fond O
affection O
of O
her O
children O
, O
the O
unusual O
assumption O
of O
protecting O
manliness O
in O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
so O
touchingly O
united O
with O
the O
deep O
respect O
that O
prevented O
the O
least O
intrusive O
question O
as O
to O
the O
cause O
of O
her O
distress O
till O
she O
chose O
to O
reveal O
it O
, O
gave O
her O
power O
to O
send O
back O
the O
tears O
that O
had O
escaped O
at O
first O
so O
hot O
and O
fast O
, O
and O
though O
still O
holding O
his O
hand O
, O
as O
if O
its O
very O
pressure O
was O
support O
, O
she O
was O
enabled O
calmly O
to O
relate O
the O
fatal O
discovery O
of O
that B-TIME
evening E-TIME
. O
Its O
effect O
was O
, O
in O
truth O
, O
as O
if O
a O
thunderbolt O
had O
fallen O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
them O
. O
An O
execration O
, O
forcibly O
checked O
, O
but O
passionate O
as O
his O
nature O
, O
burst O
from O
the O
lips O
of O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
as O
he O
clamped O
his O
arm O
close O
round O
his O
mother O
, O
as O
thus O
to O
protect O
her O
from O
the O
misery O

felt O
himself O
. O
Herbert S-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
low O
cry O
of O
pain O
, O
buried O
his O
face O
in O
his O
hands O

Caroline S-PERSON
, O
shocked O

bewildered O
, O

her O
first S-ORDINAL
thought O
for O
her O
mother O
, O
could O
only O
look O
at O

feel O
for O
her O
, O
quite O
forgetting O
that O
her O
every O
prejudice O
against O
Ellen S-PERSON
did O
indeed O
seem O
fulfilled O
. O
Emmeline S-PERSON
at O
first S-ORDINAL
looked O
stunned O
, O
then O
sinking O
down O
at O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
feet O
, O
hid O
her O
face O
on O
her O
lap O

sobbed O
with O
such O
uncontrolled O
violence O
, O
that O
it O
might O
have O
seemed O
as O
if O
she O
herself O

the O
guilty O
cause O

Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON

Caroline S-PERSON

could O
only O
think O

feel O
for O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON

knew O
so O
well O
all O
the O
hope O

interest O
, O

love O
which O
Ellen S-PERSON
had O
excited O
, O
and O
what O
must O
be O
the O
bitter O
suffering O
of O
this O
fearful O
disappointment O

" O
Do O
not O
weep O
thus O
, O
love O

" O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
said O
, O
addressing O
Emmeline S-PERSON

after O
nearly B-TIME
a I-TIME
quarter I-TIME
of I-TIME

hour E-TIME

passed O

the O
various O
emotions O

found O
vent O
in O
words O
well O
illustrative O
of O
their O
respective O
characters O

all O
but O
Emmeline S-PERSON
who O
continued O
to O
sob O
so O
painfully O
, O
that O
her O
mother O
successfully O
forgot O
her O
own O
sorrow O
to O
comfort O
her O
. O
" O
Ellen S-PERSON
is O
still O
very O
young O

she O
is O
giving O
us O
all O
this O
misery O

disappointment O
now O

may O
become O
all O

can O

her O

by O
- O
and O
- O
by O
. O
We O
must O
not O
give O
up O
all O
hope O
, O
because O
now O
all O
my O
cares O
seem O
so O
blighted O

There O
is O
some O
fatal O
mystery O
attached O
to O
her O
conduct O

am O
indeed O
deceived O

wretched O

is O
some O
hope O

she O
not O
speak O

rejoined O
Percy S-PERSON

impetuously O

for O
when O
he O
found O
his O
mother O
resuming O
control O

firmness O

had O
given O
vent O
to O
his O
indignation O

striding O
hastily O
up O

down O
the O
room O

" O
What O

the O
most O
determined O
hardihood O

wickedness O

there O

with O
deep O
feeling O

there O
does O
, O
indeed O

replied O
Percy S-PERSON

sternly O
, O
before O
his O
mother O
could O

Shame O

Emmeline's S-PERSON

" O
One S-CARDINAL
word O
of O
confession O
— O
one S-CARDINAL
evidence O
that O
her O
sin O
originated O
in O
a O
momentary O
temptation O

that O
it O

nothing O

one O
real O

Few O

yet O
when O
the O
prayer O

fell O
on O
every O
heart O

fearful O
knell O

a O
very O
uncomfortable O

the O
person O

suspicion O

CHAPTER O
VI O
. O
THE O
SENTENCE O
, O
AND O
ITS O
EXECUTION O
. O
The O
excitement O
which O
reigned O
in O
the O
servants' O
hall O
, O
after O
they O
had O
withdrawn O
, O
in O
the O
most O
respectful O
silence O
, O
from O
the O
library O
, O
was O
extreme O
. O
Robert S-PERSON
, O
utterly O
unable O
to O
realize O
relief O
in O
this O
proof O
of O
his O
own O
innocence O
, O
could O
only O
pace O
the O
hall O
in O
agony O
, O
deploring O
his O
mad O
carelessness O
, O
which O
, O
by O
exposing O
to O
temptation O
, O
had O
caused O
it O
all O
| | O
and O
Morris S-PERSON
and O
Ellis S-PERSON
deepened O
the O
remorse O
by O
perfectly O
agreeing O
with O
him O
. O
Before O
they O
separated O
, O
the O
old O
steward O
called O
them O
all O
together O
| | O
and O
, O
his O
voice O
trembling O
with O
agitation O
, O
the O
tears O
actually O
running O
down O
his O
furrowed O
cheeks O
, O
told O
them O
that O
even O
as O
their O
mistress O
had O
done O
her O
duty O
to O
the O
utmost O
, O
ay O
, O
more O
than O
the O
utmost O
by O
them O
— O
for O
it O
must O
have O
well O
- O
nigh O
broken O
her O
heart O
to O
do O
it O
— O
a O
solemn O
duty O
was O
demanded O
from O
them O
to O
her O
, O
and O
that O
if O
either O
man O
, O
woman O
, O
or O
child O
failed O
in O
it O
, O
he O
should O
know O
that O
they O
had O
neither O
feeling O
, O
honor O
, O
nor O
gratitude O
in O
their O
hearts O
, O
and O
deserved O
and O
should O
be O
scouted O
by O
them O
all O
| | O
and O
that O
duty O
was O
never O
to O
let O
the O
event O
of O
that O
night O
pass O
their O
lips O
, O
even O
to O
each O
other O
. O
It O
was O
enough O
that O
all O
mystery O
and O
suspicion O
had O
been O
taken O
from O
them O
, O
and O
that O
time O
would O
clear O
up O
the O
remainder O
| | O
he O
never O
would O
believe O
the O
grandchild O
of O
his O
mistress's O
father O
, O
one O
she O
had O
so O
loved O
and O
cared O
for O
, O
could O
willfully O
act O
as O
appearances O
seemed O
to O
say O
| | O
that O
he O
was O
sure O
, O
one O
day O
or O
other O
, O
they O
would O
all O
find O
there O
was O
much O
more O
to O
pity O
than O
to O
blame O
| | O
and O
till O
then O
, O
if O
they O
had O
the O
least O
spark O
of O
generous O
or O
grateful O
feeling O
, O
they O
would O
forget O
the O
whole O
affair O
, O
and O
only O
evince O
their O
sense O
of O
their O
mistress's O
conduct O
, O
by O
yet O
greater O
respect O
and O
attention O
to O
their O
respective O
duties O
. O
The O
old O
man's O
speech O
was O
garrulous O
, O
and O
perhaps O
often O
faulty O
in O
grammar O
, O
but O
it O
came O
from O
the O
heart O
, O
and O
so O
went O
to O
the O
heart O
at O
once O
, O
and O
not O
one O
held O
back O
from O
the O
pledge O
of O
silence O
he O
demanded O
. O
There O
are O
some O
who O
imagine O
that O
the O
refinement O
of O
feeling O
which O
alone O
could O
actuate O
Morris's S-PERSON
speech O
, O
and O
its O
warm O
and O
immediate O
response O
, O
is O
only O
to O
be O
found O
among O
the O
educated O
and O
the O
rich O
: O
how O
little O
those O
who O
thus O
suppose O
understand O
the O
human O
heart O

Kindness O
begets O
kindness O

and O
if O
superiors O
will O

think O
of O

and O
seek O
the O
happiness O

eternal O

The B-TIME
next I-TIME
morning E-TIME
, O
when O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
had O
occasion O
to O
speak O
to O
Morris S-PERSON
about O
some O
farm O
receipts O
, O
which O
had O
not O
been O
forthcoming O
the B-DATE
preceding I-DATE
day E-DATE
, O
she O
recalled O
him O
as O
he O
was O
departing O
| | O
but O
the O
words O
she O
had O
to O
say O
seemed O
unusually O
difficult O
, O
for O
her O
voice O
audibly O
faltered O
, O
and O
her O
face O
was O
completely O
shaded O
by O
her O
hand O
. O
It O
was O
simply O
to O
ask O
that O
which O
Morris's S-PERSON
loving O
reverence O
had O
already O
done O
| | O
and O
when O
the O
old O
man O
, O
in O
those O
earnest O
accents O
of O
heartfelt O
respect O
and O
kindness O
which O
never O
can O
be O
mistaken O
, O
related O
what O
had O
passed O
, O
his O
mistress O
hastily O
extended O
her O
hand O
to O
him O
, O
saying O
, O
in O
a O
tone O
he O
never O
forgot O
— O
" O
God O
bless O
you O
, O
Morris S-PERSON
! O
I O
ought O
to O
have O
known O
your O
love O
for O
your O
master's O
house O
would O
have O
urged O
this O
, O
without O
any O
request O
from O
me O
. O
I O
can O
not O
thank O
you O
enough O
. O
" O
The O
kiss O
he O
ventured O
to O
press O
upon O
the O
delicate O
hand O
which O
pressed O
his O
rough O
palm O
, O
was O
not O
unaccompanied O
, O
though O
he O
did O
force O
back O
the O
tear O
, O
and O
most O
respectfully O
, O
yet O
very O
earnestly O
, O
beseech O
his O
mistress O
not O
to O
take O
on O
too O
much O
. O
There O
must O
be O
some O
cause O
, O
some O
mystery O

no O
one O
belonging O
to O
her O
could O
so O
have O
acted O
without O
some O
very O
fearful O
temptation O
, O
some O
very O
powerful O
reason O
, O
and O
it O
would O
all O
come O
straight O
one B-DATE
day E-DATE
. O
But O
whatever O
the O
future O
, O
the O
present O
was O
only O
suffering O

for O
, O
to O
obtain O
a O
full O
confession O
from O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
felt O
so O
absolutely O
incumbent O
on O
her O
, O
that O
she O
steadily O
refused O
to O
listen O
to O
either O
pity O
or O
affection O
, O
which O
could O
shake O
her O
firmness O
| | O
and O
the O
opinion O
and O
advice O
of O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
strengthened O
the O
determination O
. O
He O
had O
a O
private O
interview O
with O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
but O
it O
was O
attended O
with O
so O
very O
little O
success O
, O
that O
he O
left O
her O
far O
more O
bewildered O
and O
grieved O
than O
he O
had O
sought O
her O
| | O
but O
fully O
convinced O
it O
was O
mere O
hardihood O
and O
obstinacy O
, O
which O
caused O
her O
incomprehensible O
and O
most O
guilty O
silence O
. O
Not O
even O
allowing O
, O
as O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
had O
, O
that O
there O
was O
any O
evidence O
of O
misery O
and O
remorse O

perhaps O
she O
had O
been O
more O
quiet O
, O
more O
resolutely O
calm O
, O
and O
if O
it O
had O
not O
been O
for O
the O
strong O

Percy's S-PERSON
watchful O
care O
had O
so O
quietly O
interposed O

that O
his O
mother O
found O
herself O
in O
their O
usual O
sitting O

room O

in O
the O
midst O
of O
them O
all O

could O
seek O
Ellen S-PERSON

and O
when O
, O
with O
half S-CARDINAL
reproach O
, O
she O
told O
him O
, O
that O
she O
had O
still O
a O
most O
painful O
duty O
to O
accomplish O

he O
ought O
not O
to O
have O
prevented O
it O

answered O
impetuously O
— O
" O
Mother O
, O
you O
shall O
not O
see O
Ellen S-PERSON

more O
alone O

has O
made O
you O
miserable O
enough O
already O

each O
time O
that O
she O
sees O
you O

her O
deceitful O
appearance O
of O
remorse O

suffering O

can O
not O

real O

add O
to O
it O

for O
her O
here O

her O
your O
decision O

us O
all O

" O
And O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
complied O
, O
for O
she O
felt O
as O
if O
her O
firmness O
would O
be O
less O
likely O
to O
fail O
, O
than O
if O
Ellen S-PERSON
attempted O
any O
thing O
like O
supplication O
with O
her O
alone O
. O
But O
not O
a O
word O
of O
supplication O
came O
. O
Ellen S-PERSON
had O
answered O
the O
summons O
, O
by O
quietly O
accompanying O
Ellis S-PERSON

had O
been O
sent O
for O
her O

to O
her O
aunt's O
presence O

pale O
, O
indeed O
, O
as O
marble O
, O

so O
tearless O

still O
, O
as O
to O
seem O
unmoved O
. O
An O
expression O
of O
actual O
relief O
stole O
over O
her O
features O
as O
she O
heard O
her O
sentence O
, O
undisturbed O
even O
when O
told O
that O
this O
would O
only O
be O
, O

Mr. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
sentence O
came O

continued O
silent O

then O
, O
of O
course O
whatever O
severer O
measures O
he O
might O
dictate O
would O
be O
instantly O

when O
Mrs. O

proceeded O
to O
say O
that O

intended O
writing O
the O
whole O
affair O
to O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
that O
his O
influence O
might O
awaken O
her O
to O
a O
sense O
of O
the O
fearfully O
aggravated O
guilt O
she O
was O
incurring O
by O
her O
silence O
, O
an O
expression O
of O
the O
most O
intense O
agony O
succeeded O
the O
previous O
calm O
, O
and O
sinking O
down O
before O
her O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
wildly O
implored O
— O

almost O
passionate O
violence O
) O
she O
must O
be O
an O
object O
of O
hate O
and O
loathing O
, O
yet O
that O
her O
sin O
was O
known O
, O
was O
a O
relief O
so O
inexpressibly O
blessed O
, O
she O
felt O
strengthened O
to O
endure O
every O
thing O
else O
. O
She O
knew O
, O
and O
her O
God O
knew O
, O
the O
agonized O
temptation O
to O
the O
momentary O
act O
, O
and O
the O
cause O
of O
her O
determined O
silence O
. O
She O
felt O
there O
was O
strange O
comfort O
in O
that O
| | O
though O
she O
knew O
no O
punishment O
could O
be O
too O
severe O
for O
the O
sin O
itself O
, O
and O
she O
prayed O
constantly O
to O
be O
enabled O
to O
bear O
it O
, O
and O
still O
not O
to O
betray O
her O
brother O
| | O
and O
the O
consequence O
of O
these O
petitions O
was O
a O
calm O
, O
gentle O
, O
deeply O
submissive O
demeanor O
. O
Not O
a O
murmur O
ever O
passed O
her O
lips O
, O
and O
Ellis S-PERSON
scarcely O
ever O
saw O
the O
signs O
of O
tears O
, O
which O
she O
longed O
for O
| | O
for O
the O
quiet O
, O
but O
fearfully O
intense O
suffering O
, O
Ellen's S-PERSON
very O
evident O
daily O
portion O
, O
alarmed O
her O
for O
its O
effect O
upon O
her O
always O
delicate O
health O
. O
As O
yet O
, O
however O
, O
there O
was O
no O
outward O
appearance O
of O
its O
failing O
, O
it O
rather O
bore O
up O
, O
from O
the O
cessation O
of O
the O
nervous O
dread O
and O
constant O
terror O
, O
which O
she O
had O
endured O
before O
| | O
and O
before O
Mr. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
letter O
arrived O
, O
a B-DATE
month E-DATE
after O
the O
fatal O
discovery O
, O
Ellis S-PERSON
had O
drawn O
her O
own O
conclusions O
, O
and O
her O
manner O
, O
instead O
of O
being O
distant O
and O
cold O
, O
had O
become O
so O
excessively O
kind O
and O
feeling O
, O
that O
the O
poor O
girl O
felt O
some O
heavy O
change O
must O
be O
impending O
, O
she O
dared O
not O
look O
to O
the O
continuance O
of O
such O
comfort O
. O
But O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
never O
saw O
her O
niece O
, O
save O
when O
no O
words O
could O
pass O
between O
them O
| | O
and O
she O
could O
not O
judge O
as O
Ellis S-PERSON
did O
. O
She O
could O
only O
feel O
, O
as O
each O
day O
passed O
, O
without O
bringing O
the O
desired O
proof O
of O
sorrow O
and O
amendment O
, O
more O
and O
more O
bewildered O
, O
and O
very O
wretched O
. O
Though O
, O
for O
her O
children's O
sake O
, O
she O
so O
conquered O
the O
feeling O
as O
, O
after O
the B-DATE
first I-DATE
week E-DATE
, O
to O
restore O
cheerfulness O
, O
and O
promote O
the O
various O
amusements O
they O
had O
all O
so O
enjoyed O
. O
Ellen's S-PERSON
disappearance O
had O
of O
course O
to O
be O
accounted O
for O
, O
to O
the O
intimate O
friends O
with O
whom O
they O
so O
constantly O
were O
| | O
but O
her O
acknowledgment O
that O
she O
had O
been O
disappointed O
in O
her O
, O
and O
that O
her O
conduct O
would O
not O
allow O
her O
any O
social O
or O
domestic O
indulgence O
, O
at O
least O
for O
a O
time O
, O
satisfied O
the O
elder O
members O
. O
Annie S-PERSON
, O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
, O
discovered O
that O
Caroline S-PERSON
was O
her O
match O
in O
cleverness O
, O
merely O
from O
her O
excessive O
truth O
and O
simplicity O
, O
and O
that O
, O
manœuvre O
as O
she O
might O
, O
she O
could O
not O
discover O
the O
smallest O
clew O
to O
this O
sudden O
mystery O
. O
And O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
, O
and O
on O
this O
one S-CARDINAL
subject O
alone O
, O
found O
Herbert S-PERSON
and O
Emmeline S-PERSON
impenetrably O
reserved O
. O
As O
soon O
as O
Mrs. O
Langford S-PERSON
had O
been O
informed O
by O
her O
son O
, O
at O
his O
mistress's O
desire O
, O
of O
the O
unanswerable O
proof O
of O
his O
innocence O
, O
she O
hastened O
to O
the O
Hall O
, O
and O
requesting O
a O
private O
interview O
with O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
placed O
at O
once O
in O
her O
hands O
all O
the O
trinkets O
and O
watch O
, O
with O
which O
she O
had O
been O
at O
different O
times O
intrusted O
| | O
related O
all O
that O
had O
passed O
between O
her O
and O
Miss O
Fortescue S-PERSON
, O
the O
excessive O
misery O
she O
seemed O
to O
be O
enduring O
| | O
and O
confessed O
that O
the O
few O
pounds O
she O
had O
given O
her O
, O
as O
the O
sums O
obtained O
by O
the O
sale O
of O
the O
trinkets O
, O
she O
had O
advanced O
herself O
, O
having O
resolved O
that O
nothing O
should O
induce O
her O
to O
dispose O
of O
them O
| | O
and O
that O
of O
course O
it O
was O
the O
difficulty O
she O
had O
in O
advancing O
their O
right O
value O
, O
which O
had O
occasioned O
the O
length O
of O
time O
that O
had O
elapsed O
since O
Ellen S-PERSON
had O
first S-ORDINAL
sought O
her O
. O
" O
Would O
it O
not O
go O
far O
to O
prove O
she O
really O
did O
wish O
to O
return O
the O
money O
? O
" O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
thought O
, O
long O
after O
the O
widow O
had O
left O
her O
, O
and O
the O
sums O
she O
had O
advanced O
returned O
with O
interest O
. O
" O
Was O
it O
to O
return O
the O
fatally O
appropriated O
sum O
, O
or O
because O
she O
needed O
more O
? O
Ellen S-PERSON
had O
so O
positively O
, O
and O
with O
such O
agony O
asserted O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
, O
that O
it O
was O
scarcely O
possible O
to O
disbelieve O
her O
| | O
but O
what O
was O
this O
fearful O
difficulty O
, O
this O
pressing O
demand O
by O
one O
so O
young O
for O
so O
much O
money O
? O
Why O
, O
if O
it O
were O
comparatively O
innocent O
, O
would O
she O
not O
speak O
? O
" O
The O
more O
she O
thought O
, O
the O
more O
perplexed O
and O
anxious O
she O
seemed O
to O
become O
. O
The O
act O
itself O
of O
endeavoring O
to O
dispose O
of O
the O
trinkets O
, O
especially O
those O
that O
had O
been O
given O
and O
received O
, O
as O
doubly O
valuable O
because O
they O
had O
been O
worn O
by O
her O
mother O
, O
would O
have O
been O
sufficiently O
faulty O
to O
have O
occasioned O
natural O
displeasure O
, O
but O
compared O
with O
other O
known O
and O
unknown O
faults O
, O
it O
sunk O
into O
almost O
nothing O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
collected O
them O
all O
together O
, O
those O
Mrs. O
Langford S-PERSON
had O
returned O
, O
and O
the O
few O
remaining O
in O
her O
niece's O
drawer O
, O
and O
carefully O
put O
them O
away O
, O
till O
circumstances O
might O
authorize O
her O
returning O
them O
to O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
and O
determined O
on O
saying O
nothing O
more O
on O
the O
subject O
either O
to O
Ellen S-PERSON
or O
her O
own O
family O
. O
One S-CARDINAL
thing O
Ellis S-PERSON
reported O
to O
her O
regarding O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
which O
certainly O
seemed O
like O
a O
consciousness O
of O
the O
wrong O
she O
had O
done O
Robert S-PERSON
, O
and O
a O
wish O
to O
atone O
for O
it O
. O
She O
begged O
Ellis S-PERSON
so O
earnestly O
that O
she O
might O
see O
him O
, O
if O
it O
were O
only O
for O
five B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
, O
that O
she O
could O
not O
resist O
her O
| | O
and O
when O
he O
came O
, O
she O
implored O
him O
so O
touchingly O
, O
so O
pleadingly O
to O
forgive O
her O
long O
silence O
himself O
, O
and O
entreat O
his O
mother O
to O
do O
so O
too O
| | O
assuring O
him O
, O
that O
it O
was O
the O
hope O
of O
being O
able O
to O
restore O
the O
notes O
to O
him O
, O
without O
revealing O
her O
identity O
, O
which O
had O
caused O
the O
silence O
, O
that O
it O
was O
scarcely O
possible O
to O
listen O
to O
her O
unmoved O
. O
It O
was O
no O
false O
humility O
, O
but O
the O
deepest O
, O
most O
unfeigned O
contrition O
for O
having O
been O
the O
cause O
of O
injury O
. O
Ten B-DATE
days E-DATE
after O
Ellen's S-PERSON
imprisonment O
, O
the O
letter O
arrived O
from O
Sir O
Edward B-PERSON
Manly E-PERSON
, O
which O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
had O
alluded O
to O
as O
necessary O
to O
be O
received O
, O
before O
she O
could O
write O
to O
her O
nephew O
, O
and O
the O
news O
it O
brought O
, O
though O
somewhat O
alloyed O
, O
would O
at O
another O
time O
have O
been O
received O
with O
the O
greatest O
delight O
. O
Edward S-PERSON
was O
returning O
. O
In O
three B-DATE
weeks E-DATE
, O
or O
a B-DATE
month E-DATE
at O
the O
utmost O
, O
after O
the O
receipt O
of O
his O
commander's O
letter O
, O
he O
might O
be O
with O
them O
all O
| | O
invalided O
home O
for O
a O
three S-CARDINAL
or O
four S-CARDINAL
months' O
leave O
. O
There O
had O
been O
another O
, O
and O
rather O
severe O
engagement O
, O
in O
which O
young O
Fortescue S-PERSON
had O
still O
more O
distinguished O
himself O
| | O
but O
from O
his O
headlong O
courage O
had O
been O
severely O
, O
but O
not O
at O
all O
seriously O
, O
hurt O
. O
Sir O
Edward S-PERSON
intended O
sending O
the O
pirate O
frigate O
which O
they O
had O
taken O
to O
England S-GPE
, O
as O
she O
was O
a O
tight O
- O
built O
, O
well O
looking O
craft O
enough O
, O
he O
wrote O
, O
if O
manned O
with O
honorable O
men O
instead O
of O
desperate O
villians O
| | O
and O
had O
nominated O
Harding S-PERSON
and O
Fortescue S-PERSON
to O
accompany O
the O
second S-ORDINAL
lieutenant O
, O
as O
her O
officers O
. O
The O
name O
of O
Harding S-PERSON
produced O
no O
disagreeable O
reminiscences O
in O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
mind O
. O
It O
had O
been O
so O
very O
long O
since O
Edward S-PERSON
had O
even O
mentioned O
him O
, O
that O
she O
had O
almost O
forgotten O
his O
early O
fancy O
for O
him O
. O
Her O
only O
thought O
now O
was O
thankfulness O
that O
her O
gallant O
nephew O
had O
been O
preserved O
, O
and O
that O
he O
was O
coming O
home O
. O
It O
could O
scarcely O
be O
pleasure O
she O
felt O
, O
though O
all O
the O
young O
party O
did O
, O
for O
there O
was O
such O
an O
excitement O
in O
Edward's S-PERSON
courage O
, O
and O
in O
his O
having O
been O
in O
two S-CARDINAL
desperate O
engagements O
, O
and O
seen O
so O
much O
, O
that O
, O
with O
the O
buoyancy O
happily O
natural O
to O
well O
- O
disposed O
youth O
, O
they O
could O
only O
think O
and O
talk O
of O
his O
return O
, O
forgetting O
the O
alloy O
that O
must O
cloud O
it O
. O
Percy S-PERSON
and O
Herbert S-PERSON
hoped O
he O
would O
arrive O
within O
the B-DATE
three I-DATE
weeks E-DATE
, O
as O
then O
they O
should O
be O
with O
him O
at B-DATE
least I-DATE
a I-DATE
week E-DATE
or O
ten B-DATE
days E-DATE
. O
If O
delayed O
, O
he O
would O
very O
provokingly O
just O
arrive O
as O
they O
would O
be O
returning O
to O
college O
. O
After O
much O
painful O
deliberation O
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
determined O
on O
making O
Herbert S-PERSON
her O
messenger O
with O
these O
unexpected O
tidings O
to O
Ellen S-PERSON
| | O
hoping O
more O
than O
she O
expressed O
that O
his O
gentle O
eloquence O
in O
bringing O
before O
her O
the O
misery O
to O
which O
she O
must O
condemn O
her O
brother O
if O
she O
would O
persist O
in O
this O
silence O
, O
and O
so O
compel O
an O
appeal O
to O
him O
, O
would O
have O
some O
effect O
| | O
especially O
as O
she O
charged O
him O
to O
impress O
upon O
her O
that O
even O
now O
confession O
should O
bring O
pardon O
, O
and O
concealment O
of O
all O
from O
Edward S-PERSON
. O
Herbert S-PERSON
gladly O
undertook O
the O
mission O
, O
and O
so O
feelingly O
, O
so O
earnestly O
discharged O
it O
, O
that O
poor O
Ellen S-PERSON
felt O
more O
heart O
- O
broken O
than O
she O
had O
done O
yet O
, O
and O
almost O
incapable O
of O
retaining O
her O
firmness O
. O
But O
she O
did O
| | O
for O
danger O
to O
Edward S-PERSON
seemed O
more O
imminent O
now O
that O
he O
was O
coming O
home O
, O
to O
the O
very O
vicinity O
of O
his O
dreaded O
uncle O
, O
than O
when O
he O
was O
at O
a O
distance O
. O
She O
could O
only O
feel O
thankful O
— O
if O
concealment O
were O
indeed O
so O
absolutely O
necessary O
as O
he O
had O
declared O
it O
to O
be O
— O
that O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
was O
still O
from O
home O
, O
and O
might O
continue O
to O
be O
so O
during O
Edward's S-PERSON
visit O
. O
It O
was O
difficult O
to O
repress O
the O
sickening O
shudder O
, O
when O
Herbert S-PERSON
chanced O
to O
mention O
that O
Harding S-PERSON
was O
her O
brother's O
companion O
in O
his O
voyage O
home O
, O
and O
difficult O
, O
not O
to O
express O
more O
disappointment O
than O
the O
occasion O
warranted O
, O
that O
Edward S-PERSON
had O
not O
answered O
her O
last O
letter O
. O
He O
must O
have O
received O
it O
, O
Herbert S-PERSON
said O
, O
for O
Sir O
Edward S-PERSON
acknowledged O
his O
father's O
in O
which O
hers O
to O
Edward S-PERSON
had O
been O
inclosed O
. O
He O
left O
her O
after O
a O
very O
long O
interview O
, O
deeply O
grieved O
at O
the O
failure O
of O
all O
his O
persuasions O
, O
all O
his O
remonstrances O
, O
but O
compelled O
, O
he O
could O
not O
satisfactorily O
explain O
why O
, O
either O
to O
himself O
or O
to O
his O
family O
, O
to O
pity O
far O
more O
than O
to O
blame O
. O
Percy S-PERSON
declared O
, O
as O
did O
Caroline S-PERSON
and O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
, O
that O
it O
must O
be O
only O
his O
own O
too O
kind O
and O
gentle O
disposition O
, O
which O
never O
could O
blame O
anybody O
or O
any O
thing O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
was O
bitterly O
disappointed O
| | O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
insisted O
that O
such O
obduracy O
demanded O
nothing O
but O
the O
sternest O
treatment O
, O
and O
he O
only O
wished O
Mr. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
letter O
could O
arrive O
at O
once O
. O
He O
saw O
Ellen S-PERSON
again O
himself O
twice O
in O
the B-DATE
five I-DATE
weeks E-DATE
, O
which O
elapsed O
between O
the O
discovery O
of O
her O
sin O
and O
the O
arrival O
of O
Mr. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
answer O
| | O
but O
if O
kindness O
had O
so O
failed O
, O
it O
was O
comparatively O
easy O
to O
resist O
his O
well O
- O
intentioned O
, O
but O
in O
this O
case O
utterly O
mistaken O
sternness O
. O
He O
was O
in O
general O
so O
kind O
even O
in O
his O
judgments O
, O
that O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
thought O
he O
must O
have O
some O
reason O
to O
believe O
Ellen S-PERSON
so O
thoroughly O
hardened O
, O
and O
from O
his O
report O
of O
her O
was O
enabled O
to O
impart O
her O
husband's O
sentence O
with O
more O
firmness O
, O
than O
had O
she O
listened O
to O
her O
own O
kind O
, O
still O
loving O
heart O
. O
It O
was O
as O
she O
and O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
had O
both O
expected O
. O
Ellen S-PERSON
was O
no O
longer O
to O
remain O
at O
Oakwood S-GPE
, O
but O
to O
be O
placed O
under O
the O
care O
of O
a O
maiden O
lady O
, O
living O
in O
Yorkshire S-GPE
, O
a O
relation O
of O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
and O
one O
who O
had O
occasionally O
visited O
Oakwood S-GPE
, O
and O
was O
, O
therefore O
, O
well O
known O
to O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
and O
to O
Ellis S-PERSON
too O
, O
and O
regarded O
with O
such O
dislike O
by O
the O
latter O
, O
as O
to O
make O
her O
actually O
venture O
to O
entreat O
her O
mistress O
not O
to O
send O
Miss O
Ellen S-PERSON
to O
her O
| | O
she O
was O
sure O
it O
would O
break O
her O
heart O
. O
Now O
Miss O
Seldon S-PERSON
was O
one O
of O
the O
worthiest O
women O
that O
ever O
breathed O
— O
honest O
, O
straightforward O
, O
truth O
- O
speaking O
literally O
to O
a O
fault O
, O
but O
as O
hard O
as O
she O
was O
true O
. O
Whether O
she O
ever O
had O
any O
feelings O
or O
not O
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
with O
all O
her O
penetration O
, O
never O
could O
discover O
| | O
but O
the O
good O
she O
did O
was O
immense O
in O
practical O
benevolence O
, O
though O
the O
quick O
sympathy O
, O
the O
kindly O
word O
, O
the O
indulgent O
thought O
, O
seemed O
utterly O
unknown O
. O
She O
had O
no O
pity O
for O
faults O
or O
failings O
, O
always O
declaring O
forbearance O
and O
love O
were O
all O
folly O
| | O
" O
if O
a O
branch O
were O
in O
the O
slightest O
degree O
decayed O
, O
cut O
it O
off O

if O
the O
blight O
extend O
to O
the O
root O
, O
destroy O
it O
, O
" O
she O
was O
fond O
of O
saying O
. O
As O
for O
youthful O
follies O
or O
errors O
, O
she O
had O
no O
patience O
with O
them O
, O
for O
never O
having O
been O
, O
or O
rather O
felt O
young O
herself O
, O
she O
could O
not O
understand O
the O
age O
in O
others O
. O
Ellis S-PERSON
had O
not O
discrimination O
enough O
to O
discern O
the O
good O
which O
lay O
under O
this O
very O
disagreeable O
exterior O
| | O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
had O
| | O
and O
suffering O
as O
she O
knew O
a O
residence O
with O
her O
must O
be O
to O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
if O
indeed O
she O
were O
really O
the O
character O
she O
had O
seemed O
in O
childhood O
— O
though O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
few I-DATE
months E-DATE
had O
so O
contradicted O
it O
— O
she O
felt O
her O
husband O
had O
decided O
wisely O
, O
spite O
of O
the O
misery O
which O
still O
even O
the O
very O
thought O
of O
sending O
her O
orphan O
niece O
so O
completely O
from O
her O
, O
was O
to O
herself O
. O
Mr. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
letter O
read O
harshly O
, O
but O
his O
wife O
knew O
his O
high O
, O
almost O
stern O
principles O
| | O
he O
had O
not O
seen O
Ellen's S-PERSON
evident O
anguish O
| | O
he O
could O
only O
judge O
from O
the O
relation O
which O
had O
been O
sent O
him O
, O
and O
all O
which O
that O
told O
was O
indeed O
against O
her O
. O
Of O
course O
he O
said O
, O
if O
she O
had O
confessed O
, O
and O
her O
confession O
in O
any O
degree O
, O
pleaded O
for O
her O
, O
his O
wife O
would O
use O
her O
own O
judgment O
as O
to O
the O
period O
of O
her O
banishment O
| | O
but O
he O
could O
not O
imagine O
any O
cause O
for O
her O
conduct O
sufficiently O
excusing O
, O
as O
to O
demand O
the O
avoidance O
of O
his O
sentence O
altogether O
. O
Miss O
Seldon's S-PERSON
last O
visit O
to O
Oakwood S-GPE
was O
sufficiently O
well O
remembered O
by O
the O
young O
Hamiltons S-PERSON
( O
though O
, O
it O
was O
before O
their O
cousins O
had O
arrived O
from O
India S-GPE
) O
, O
for O
them O
all O
— O
even O
Percy S-PERSON
and O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
the O
most O
indignant O
against O
Ellen S-PERSON
— O
to O
think O
of O
their O
father's O
sentence O
with O
the O
deepest O
regret O
, O
and O
with O
almost O
dread O
for O
its O
effect O
on O
Ellen S-PERSON
. O
" O
If O
she O
did O
but O
know O
her O
, O
she O
must O
speak O
, O
" O
was O
Emmeline's S-PERSON
exclamation O
. O
" O
I O
did O
not O
feel O
quite O
sure O

I O

in O
Yorkshire S-GPE
— O
" O

do O
not O
joke O

can O
not O
bear O
to O

of O

all O

much O
less O

I O
know O

is O
very O
good O

answered O
Herbert S-PERSON
. O
" O
Now O
, O
my O
good O
fellow O

do O
not O
attempt O

say O
a O
word O
for O
Nancy B-PERSON
Seldon E-PERSON

person O

for O
any O
thing O
else O

" O
" O
Poor O
Ellen S-PERSON

she O
little O

obstinacy O

I O

confession O

" O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
might O
and O
did O
think O
with O
them O
all O
, O
but O
she O
could O
not O
swerve O
from O
her O
duty O
. O
She O
wrote O
at O
once O
to O
Miss O
Seldon S-PERSON
, O
not O
entering O
into O
particulars O
, O
but O
merely O
asking O
if O
she O
would O
consent O
to O
take O
charge O
of O
a O
relative O
, O
whose O
conduct O
demanded O
more O
rigid O
watchfulness O
and O
care O
, O
and O
an O
entire O
cessation O
of O
indulgence O

than O
could O
be O
the O
case O
in O
the O
family O
circle O
at O
Oakwood S-GPE
. O
She O
and O
her O
husband O
had O
such O
perfect O
confidence O
in O
her O
, O
she O
said O
, O
that O
if O
she O
could O
oblige O
them O
by O
undertaking O
the O
duty O

they O
knew O

any O
assurance O
on O
her O
part O

that O
she O
would O
discharge O
it O
faithfully O
. O
The O
yearly O
sum O
they O
offered O
was O
large O

wished O

all O

best O
education O

the O
city O

she O
resided O
, O
could O
afford O

Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
had O
no O
doubt O
of O
the O
affirmative O
nature O
of O
the O
reply O

for O
Miss O
Seldon S-PERSON
owed O
the O
recovery O
of O
her O
fortune O

position O
entirely O
to O
the O
exertions O
of O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON

and O
she O
had O
told O
him O
, O
once O
for O
all O

that O

serve O

oblige O
him O

any O
way O

great O

small O

it O
would O
make O
her O
far O
happier O
than O
she O
had O
ever O
been O
, O

was O
likely O

solitary O
life O

The O
letter O
written O

dispatched O
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
summoned O
Ellen S-PERSON
once O
more O
to O
her O
presence O

The O
scene O
was O
again O
the O
library O

where O
she O
had O
been O
writing O
, O

the O
time O
nearing O
the O
short O
twilight O
of O
October S-DATE

It O
was O
three B-DATE
weeks E-DATE
, O
rather O
more O
, O
since O
Sir O
Edward B-PERSON
Manly's E-PERSON
letter O
had O
been O
received O
, O
and O
Edward S-PERSON
was O
, O
therefore O
, O
almost O
daily O
expected O
. O
The O
feelings O
with O
which O
his O
unhappy O
sister O
looked O
to O
his O
return O
it O
would O
be O
a O
vain O
attempt O
to O
define O
. O
At O
times O
the O
intense O
longing O
to O
see O
him O
again O
, O
caused O
a O
wild O
, O
almost O
sick O
feeling O
of O
pleasure O
, O
that O
she O
might O
, O
perhaps O
, O
so O
soon O
do O
so O

then O
came O
all O
that O
had O
passed O
, O
and O
she O
pictured O
his O
anger O
, O
his O
loathing O
— O
true O
it O
had O
been O
for O
him O
, O
but O
he O
had O
not O
thought O
of O
such O
a O
deed O

He O
would O
, O
he O
must O
hate O
and O
spurn O
her O
, O
too O
| | O
and O
the O
idea O
of O
meeting O
him O
became O
absolute O
agony O
. O
Then O
— O
and O
she O
shuddered O
in O
dread O
— O
would O
he O
think O
that O
he O
must O
acknowledge O
it O
was O
for O
him O
she O
had O
thus O
acted O
? O
and O
, O
if O
so O
, O
had O
she O
not O
betrayed O
instead O
of O
saving O
him O
? O
Incident O
after O
incident O
in O
their O
childhood O
rose O
before O
her O
, O
to O
give O
her O
hope O
that O
he O
would O
be O
silent O
now O
as O
then O
, O
and O
not O
betray O
himself O
| | O
but O
these O
contending O
terrors O
, O
united O
with O
the O
constant O
though O
silent O
suffering O
of O
her O
banishment O
from O
all O
she O
loved O
, O
the O
utter O
hopelessness O
as O
to O
the O
end O
of O
this O
trial O
, O

not O
been O
without O
their O
effect O
on O
the O
outward O
frame O

Ellis S-PERSON
did O
not O
see O
it O
, O
from O
so O
constantly O
watching O
her O
, O
and O
from O
Ellen S-PERSON
never O
refusing O
to O
take O
the O
exercise O
she O
desired O
her O
, O
and O
not O
making O
a O
single O
complaint O
as O
to O
the O
pain O
it O
was O
sometimes O
to O
walk O
, O
and O
always O
to O
swallow O
her O
meals O
| | O
but O
as O
she O
stood O
opposite O
to O
her O
aunt O
, O
in O
the O
full O
light O
of O
the O
oriel O
window O
— O
her O
approach O
had O
been O
so O
noiseless O
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
bending O
over O
some O
papers O
, O
did O
not O
see O
her O
till O
she O
chanced O
to O
look O
up O
— O
the O
attenuation O
of O
form O
and O
feature O
was O
so O
very O
visible O
, O
that O
her O
aunt O
could O
not O
prevent O
herself O
from O
starting O
painfully O
, O
and O
the O
words O
with O
which O
she O
had O
intended O
to O
address O
her O
froze O
on O
her O
lips O
. O
It O
was O
with O
the O
utmost O
difficulty O
she O
refrained O
from O
folding O
her O
to O
her O
heart O
, O
and O
trying O
, O
by O
every O
means O
affection O
could O
devise O
, O
to O
soothe O
or O
remove O
that O
anguish O
, O
whatever O
its O
nature O
, O
far O
too O
deep O
and O
constant O
for O
one O
so O
very O
young O
| | O
but O
how O
dared O
she O
do O
this O
, O
when O
, O
by O
this O
determined O
silence O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
so O
defied O
her O
authority O
, O
and O
seemed O
so O
resolved O
that O
neither O
severity O
nor O
kindness O
, O
nor O
her O
own O
sufferings O
should O
humble O
her O
spirit O
, O
though O
they O
had O
even O
affected O
her O
frame O
? O
Conquering O
with O
a O
powerful O
effort O
the O
pleadings O
of O
affection O
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
calmly O
entered O
on O
the O
subject O
for O
which O
she O
had O
summoned O
her O
, O
reading O
to O
her O
a O
greater O
part O
of O
her O
uncle's O
letter O
, O
hoping O
that O
its O
severity O
would O
spare O
her O
the O
pain O
of O
any O
additional O
remarks O
. O
Every O
word O
seemed O
to O
burn O
itself O
on O
Ellen's S-PERSON
brain O
. O
What O
she O
had O
hoped O
she O
knew O
not O
, O
for O
she O
thought O
she O
had O
never O
hoped O
at O
all O
, O
but O
the O
words O
, O
" O
No O
cause O
can O
be O
excusing O
enough O
to O
justify O
the O
entire O
setting O
aside O
this O
sentence O
, O
" O
seemed O
by O
its O
agony O
to O
tell O
her O
that O
the O
thought O
had O
entered O
her O
mind O
, O
if O
the O
real O
cause O
were O
by O
any O
chance O
discovered O
would O
she O
be O
forgiven O
, O
and O
in O
time O
restored O
to O
confidence O
and O
love O
? O
And O
now O
it O
was O
over O
, O
even O
that O
hope O
was O
gone O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
paused O
for O
a O
reply O
or O
an O
observation O
, O
but O
none O
came O
, O
and O
she O
continued O
, O
impressively O
— O
" O
I O
can O
scarcely O
hope O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
that O
as O
even O
the O
idea O
of O
sparing O
your O
only O
brother O
shame O
and O
misery O
, O
on O
his O
return O
home O
, O
expecting O
nothing O
but O
joy O
, O
after O
nearly B-DATE
three I-DATE
years' E-DATE
separation O
and O
exposure O
to O
danger O
, O
has O
had O
no O
effect O
in O
softening O
you O
, O
that O
your O
uncle's O
sentence O
will O
. O
Once O
I O
should O
have O
believed O
that O
only O
the O
thought O
of O
leaving O
me O
, O
and O
going O
to O
the O
care O
of O
a O
stranger O
, O
would O
have O
urged O
you O
to O
speak O
directly O
. O
I O
can O
believe O
this O
no O
longer O
| | O
but O
as O
I O
wish O
you O
to O
be O
with O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
at O
least O
part O
of O
his O
stay O
with O
us O
, O
I O
shall O
postpone O
your O
leaving O
us O
, O
one B-DATE
month E-DATE
from O
to O
- O
day O
. O
If O
, O
indeed O
, O
Edward's S-PERSON
influence O
be O
such O
that O
, O
for O
his O
sake O
, O
you O
will O
make O
me O
a O
full O
confession O
and O
answer O
clearly O
and O
distinctly O
every O
question O
I O
put O
to O
you O
, O
your O
residence O
with O
Miss O
Seldon S-PERSON
shall O
be O
limited O
to O
three S-CARDINAL
, O
six S-CARDINAL
, O
ten S-CARDINAL
, O
or O
twelve B-DATE
months E-DATE
, O
according O
to O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
motive O
of O
this O
incomprehensible O
and O
, O
apparently O
most O
sinful O
conduct O
. O
If O
you O
leave O
us O
still O
obdurate O
, O
years S-DATE
will O
, O
in O
all O
probability O
, O
pass O
before O
we O
can O
feel O
sufficiently O
confident O
in O
the O
restored O
integrity O
and O
openness O
of O
your O
character O
to O
permit O
your O
return O
to O
us O
. O
The O
pain O
you O
are O
inflicting O
upon O
me O
it O
is O
useless O
to O
dwell O
upon O
. O
As O
the O
child O
of O
my O
only O
and O
most O
dearly O
loved O
sister O
, O
I O
have O
loved O
you O
, O
hoped O
for O
you O
, O
with O
little O
less O
intensity O
of O
affection O
than O
that O
I O
have O
borne O
toward O
my O
own O
| | O
for O
I O
felt O
that O
, O
with O
the O
sole O
exception O
of O
your O
brother O
, O
I O
was O
the O
only O
being O
you O
had O
on O
earth O
united O
to O
you O
by O
ties O
of O
blood O
. O
How O
this O
conduct O
repays O
my O
love O
and O
care O
you O
must O
answer O
to O
yourself O
| | O
I O
can O
only O
be O
sensible O
of O
bitter O
disappointment O
. O
" O
Again O
she O
stopped O
, O
evidently O
expecting O
a O
reply O
, O
but O
Ellen S-PERSON
still O
remained O
silent O
. O
The O
short O
twilight O
of O
autumn O
had O
set O
in O
so O
suddenly O
, O
that O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
was O
not O
aware O
her O
niece's O
cheek O
had O
become O
still O
paler O
, O
and O
that O
her O
white O
lips O
quivered O
repeatedly O
, O
as O
if O
she O
several O
times O
tried O
to O
speak O
, O
but O
could O
not O
. O
After O
a O
silence O
of O
some B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
, O
she O
said O
— O
" O
If O
you O
are O
determined O
not O
to O
speak O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
you O
may O
retire O
. O
I O
have O
told O
you O
all O
I O
wished O
to O
say O
, O
except O
that O
till O
you O
leave O
us O
though O
you O
will O
still O
occupy O
your O
present O
rooms O
, O
and O
be O
still O
under O
Ellis's O
care O
, O
you O
are O
at O
liberty O
to O
employ O
yourself O
, O
and O
go O
about O
the O
house O
and O
grounds O
as O
usual O
. O
" O
Ellen S-PERSON
turned O
to O
go O
, O
still O
in O
that O
unbroken O
silence O
| | O
she O
had O
reached O
the O
low O
step O
dividing O
the O
upper O
part O
from O
the O
lower O
part O
of O
the O
room O
, O
and O
whether O
she O
did O
not O
see O
it O
, O
or O
from O
some O
other O
cause O
, O
the O
room O
suddenly O
reeled O
before O
her O
, O
and O
she O
fell O
heavily O
forward O
. O
To O
spring O
toward O
her O
, O
raise O
her O
tenderly O
, O
bear O
her O
to O
the O
nearest O
couch O
, O
though O
she O
so O
trembled O
herself O
at O
finding O
Ellen S-PERSON
quite O
insensible O
, O
as O
to O
render O
the O
task O
unusually O
difficult O
, O
and O
to O
ring O
hastily O
for O
Ellis S-PERSON
, O
was O
the O
work O
of O
a B-TIME
minute E-TIME
, O
but O
it O
was O
many B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
before O
their O
united O
efforts O
could O
bring O
back O
consciousness O
. O
" O
I O
knew O
it O
would O
break O
her O
heart O
, O
poor O
lamb O
! O
" O
was O
Ellis's S-PERSON
exclamation O
, O
in O
a O
tone O
of O
most O
unusual O
excitement O
| | O
" O
thank O
God O
, O
thank O
God O
! O
Master O
Edward's S-PERSON
coming O
home O
, O
and O
that O
she O
is O
not O

go O
till O
he O
does O

" O
" O
Have O
you O
so O
much O
confidence O
in O
his O
influence O
? O
" O
asked O
her O
mistress O
, O
as O
, O
unable O
to O
resist O
the O
impulse O
, O
she O
bent O
down O
and O
repeatedly O
kissed O
the O
cold O
brow O
and O
cheek O
, O
to O
which O
she O
was O
so O
earnestly O
striving O
to O
restore O
warmth O
, O
" O

" O
Right O

Dear O
my O
lady O

" O
( O
whenever O
Ellis S-PERSON
was O
strongly O
moved O
, O
she O
always O
so O
addressed O
her O
mistress O

) O
" O
I O
would O
stake O
your O
confidence O

me O

is O
all O
my O
life's O
worth O

if O
Master O
Edward S-PERSON
is O
not O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
it O
all O
, O
and O
that O
this O
poor O
child O
is O
sacrificing O
herself O
for O
some O
fancied O
danger O
to O
him O

saw O
enough O
of O
that O
work O

were O
young O
children O

" O
Edward S-PERSON

" O
repeated O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
so O
bewildered O
, O
as O
to O
stop O
for O
the O
moment O
chafing O
Ellen's S-PERSON
cold O
hand O

" O

Young O
men O

some O
of O
the O

into O
difficulties O
sometimes O

it O
don't O
touch O
their O
characters O
as O
their O
officers O
see O
them O
, O
and O
Master O
Edward S-PERSON
was O
always O
so O
terrified O
at O
the O
mere O
thought O
of O
my O
master O
knowing O
any O
of O
his O
faults O

— O
hush O

we O
must O
not O
let O
her O
know O

suspect O
any O
thing O
, O
poor O
lamb O

it O
will O
make O
her O
still O
more O
miserable O
. O
You O
are O
better O
now O
, O
dear O
Miss O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
are O
you O
not O
? O
" O
she O
added O
, O
soothingly O
, O
as O
Ellen S-PERSON
feebly O
raised O
her O
hand O
to O
her O
forehead O
, O
and O
then O
slowly O
unclosed O
her O
eyes O
, O
and O
beheld O
her O
aunt O
leaning O
over O
her O
, O
with O
that O
same O
expression O
of O
anxious O
affection O
, O
which O
her O
illness O
had O
so O
often O
caused O
in O
her O
childhood O
. O
Sense O
, O
or O
rather O
memory O
, O
had O
not O
quite O
returned O
, O
and O
her O
first S-ORDINAL
words O
were O
, O
with O
a O
faint O
but O
happy O
smile O
— O
" O
I O
am O
better O
, O
dear O
aunt O
, O
much O
better O

dare O
say O
I O
shall O
soon O
be O
well O
. O
" O
But O
it O
was O
only O
a O
momentary O
forgetfulness O
| | O
swift O
as O
thought O
came O
the O
whole O
of O
what O
had O
so O
lately O
passed O
— O
her O
uncle's O
letter O
, O
her O
aunt's O
words O
, O
and O
murmuring O
, O
in O
a O
tone O
how O
painfully O
changed O
! O
" O
I O
forgot O
— O
forgive O
me O
, O
" O
she O
buried O
her O
face O
in O
the O
pillow O
. O
" O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
my O
dear O
Ellen S-PERSON
! O
why O
will O
you O
persist O
in O
making O
yourself O

me O
so O
miserable O

a O
few O
words O
would O
make O
us O
happier O

exclaimed O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
almost O
imploringly O
, O
as O
she O
bent O
over O
her O
. O
" O
Do O
not O
urge O
her O
now O

my O
lady O

enough O

her O
till O

comes O

I O
am O
sure O
she O
will O
not O
resist O
him O

answered O
Ellis S-PERSON
, O
very O
respectfully O
, O
though O
meaningly O
, O
as O
her O
look O
drew O
her O
mistress's O
attention O
to O
the O
shudder O
which O
convulsed O
Ellen's S-PERSON
slight O
frame O
, O
at O
the O
mention O
of O
her O
brother O
. O
Pained O
and O
bewildered O
more O
than O
ever O
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
after O

restraint O

removed O

Ellen S-PERSON
might O
be O
relieved O
by O
tears O

Ellis S-PERSON
to O
let O
her O
know O
in O
a O
short O
time O
how O
she O
was O

The O
moment O
the O
door O
closed O

Ellen S-PERSON
threw O
her O
arms O
round O
Ellis's O
neck O
, O
exclaiming O
passionately O
— O

me O
away O

take O
me O
away O
, O
dear O
Ellis S-PERSON

I O
can O
not O
bear O
this O
room O

it O
seems O
all O
full O
of O
misery O
! O

I O
loved O
it O
so O
once O
, O

I O
shall O
love O
it O
again O

I O
am O
miles O

miles O
away O

can O
not O

Oh O
, O
Ellis S-PERSON
, O
Ellis S-PERSON
! O
I O
knew O
you O
were O

kind O

I O
was O
too O
glad O

contented O
to O
be O
with O
you O

not O
punishment O
enough O

I O
must O
go O
away O

I O
shall O
never O

never O
see O
my O
aunt O
again O

know O
I O
shall O
not O

Oh O
! O
if O
I O
might O

die O

almost O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
since O
her O
sin O
had O
been O
discovered O

she O
gave O
way O

long O

fit O
of O
weeping O

the O

relieved O

Ellis's S-PERSON

the O
relief O

the O
supposition O

her O
heart O

could O
well O

perfectly O
remembered O

Percy's S-PERSON
voice O
. O
" O
I O
am O
a O
brute O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
nothing O
less O

forgive O
me O
, O
and O
say O
good O
- O
by O
. O
I O
can't O
understand O
it O
at O
all O
, O
but O
angry O
as O
I O
am O
with O
you O
, O
your O
pale O
face O
haunts O
me O
like O
a O
specter O
, O
so O
we O
must O
part O
friends O
| | O
" O
and O
as O
she O
looked O
hastily O
up O
, O
he O
kissed O
her O
warmly O
twice O
, O
and O
ran O
away O
without O
another O
word O
. O
Days O
passed O
heavily O
, O
the O
gales O
seeming O
to O
increase O
in O
violence O
, O
and O
causing O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
more O
terrible O
anxiety O
and O
vague O
dread O
than O
she O
allowed O
to O
be O
visible O
. O
The O
damage O
among O
the O
shipping O
was O
fearful O
, O
and O
the O
very O
supposed O
vicinity O
of O
the O
frigate O
to O
the O
Channel O
increased O
the O
danger O
. O
The O
papers O
every B-TIME
morning E-TIME
presented O
long O
lists O
of O
ships O
wrecked O
, O
or O
fatally O
dismantled O
, O
loss O
of O
crews O
or O
part O
of O
them O
, O
mails O
and O
cargoes O
due O
but O
missing O
: O
and O
the O
vivid O
recollection O
of O
the O
supposed O
fate O
of O
her O
own O
brother O
, O
the O
wretchedness O
of O
the O
suspense O
before O
the O
fate O
of O
his O
vessel O
was O
ascertained O
, O
returned O
to O
heighten O
the O
fears O
that O
would O
gain O
ascendency O
for O
her O
nephew O
, O
and O
for O
the O
effect O
of O
this O
terrible O
suspense O
on O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
more O
especially O
— O
if O
indeed O
she O
had O
endured O
all O
these O
weeks O
, O
nay O
, O
months S-DATE
, O
of O
misery O
for O
him O
. O
At O
first O
Ellen S-PERSON
seemed O
unconscious O
that O
there O
was O
any O
thing O
remarkable O
in O
the O
delay O
, O
the O
thought O
of O
her O
own O
departure O
being O
uppermost O
| | O
but O
when O
the O
thought O
did O
press O
upon O
her O
, O
how O
it O
came O
she O
knew O
not O
— O
that O
of O
the O
given O
month O
the O
weeks O
were O
passing O
, O
and O
Edward S-PERSON
had O
not O
arrived O
, O
and O
that O
there O
must O
be O
some O
reason O
for O
the O
long O
delay O
— O
storm O
, O
shipwreck O
, O
death O
, O
all O
flashed O
upon O
her O
at O
once O
, O
and O
almost O
maddened O
her O
. O
The O
quiet O
calm O
of O
endurance O
gave O
way O
. O
She O
could O
not O
sleep O
at O
night O
from O
the O
tremendous O
winds O
| | O
not O
even O
when O
Ellis S-PERSON
had O
a O
bed O
put O
up O
in O
her O
room O
, O
and O
remained O
with O
her O
all O
night O
herself O
| | O
she O
never O
complained O
indeed O
, O
but O
hour B-TIME
after I-TIME
hour E-TIME
she O
would O
pace O
her O
room O
and O
the O
passage O
leading O
to O
Ellis's S-PERSON
, O
till O
compelled O
to O
cease O
from O
exhaustion O
| | O
she O
would O
try O
steadily O
to O
employ O
herself O
with O
some O
difficult O
study O
, O
and O
succeed O
, O
perhaps O
, O
for O
half B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour E-TIME
, O
but O
then O
remain O
powerless O
, O
or O
recommence O
her O
restless O
walk O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
made O
several O
attempts O
without O
any O
apparent O
interference O
on O
her O
part O
, O
to O
get O
her O
to O
sit O
occasionally O
with O
her O
and O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
, O
and O
her O
cousins O
, O
but O
she O
seemed O
to O
shrink O
from O
them O
all O
. O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
indeed O
, O
when O
once O
aware O
of O
the O
terrible O
trial O
she O
was O
enduring O
, O
would O
sit O
with O
her O
, O
drawing O
or O
working O
as O
if O
nothing O
had O
occurred O
to O
estrange O
them O
, O
and O
try O
to O
cheer O
her O
by O
talking O
on O
many O
topics O
of O
interest O
. O
Caroline S-PERSON
would O
speak O
to O
her O
kindly O
whenever O
she O
saw O
her O
. O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
alone O
retained O
her O
indignation O
, O
for O
no O
suspicion O
of O
the O
real O
cause O
of O
her O
silence O
ever O
entered O
her O
mind O
. O
Poor O
Ellen S-PERSON
felt O
that O
she O
dared O
not O
indulge O
in O
the O
comfort O
this O
change O
in O
her O
aunt's O
and O
cousins' O
manner O
produced O
. O
She O
wanted O
to O
wean O
herself O
quite O
from O
them O
, O
that O
the O
pang O
of O
separation O
might O
be O
less O
severe O
, O
but O
she O
only O
seemed O
to O
succeed O
in O
loving O
them O
more O
. O
One S-CARDINAL
thought O
, O
indeed O
, O
at O
length O
took O
such O
entire O
possession O
of O
her O
mind O
, O
as O
to O
deaden O
every O
other O
: O
— O
it O
was O
the O
horrible O
idea O
that O
as O
she O
had O
sinned O
to O
save O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
perhaps O
, O
from O
merited O
disgrace O
, O
he O
would O
be O
taken O
from O
her O
| | O
she O
never O
breathed O
it O
, O
but O
it O
haunted O
her O
night O
and O
day O
. O
Mr. O
Maitland S-PERSON
saw O
her O
continually O
, O
but O
he O
plainly O
told O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
while O
the O
cause O
of O
anxiety O
and O
mental O
suffering O
lasted O
he O
could O
do O
her O
no O
good O
. O
It O
was O
a O
constant O
alternation O
of O
fearful O
excitement O
and O
complete O
depression O
, O
exhausting O
the O
whole O
system O
. O
Repose O
and O
kindness O
— O
alas O
! O
the O
latter O
might O
be O
given O
, O
but O
the O
former O
, O
in O
the O
present O
position O
of O
affairs O
, O
how O
could O
it O
be O
insured O
? O
The O
month O
of O
grace O
was O
waning O
| | O
only B-DATE
two I-DATE
days E-DATE
remained O
, O
and O
Edward S-PERSON
had O
not O
arrived O
, O
and O
how O
could O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
obey O
her O
husband O
— O
whose O
every O
letter O
reiterated O
his O
hope O
that O
she O
had O
not O
been O
prevailed O
on O
to O
alter O
his O
sentence O
, O
if O
Ellen S-PERSON
still O
remained O
silent O
— O
and O
send O
her O
niece O
from O
her O
? O
She O
came O
at O
length O
to O
the O
determination O
, O
that O
if O
another O
week O
passed O
and O
still O
there O
were O
no O
tidings O
, O
not O
to O
let O
this O
fearful O
self O
- O
sacrifice O
, O
if O
it O
really O
were O
such O
, O
last O
any O
longer O
, O
but O
gently O
, O
cautiously O
, O
tenderly O
as O
she O
could O
, O
prevail O
on O
Ellen S-PERSON
to O
confide O
all O
to O
her O
, O
and O
promise O
, O
if O
Edward S-PERSON
really O
had O
been O
erring O
and O
in O
difficulties O
, O
all O
should O
be O
forgiven O
for O
her O
sake O
, O
and O
even O
his O
uncle's O
anger O
averted O
. O
Once O
her O
determination O
taken O
, O
she O
felt O
better O
enabled O
to O
endure O
an O
anxiety O
which O
was O
injuring O
her O
almost O
as O
much O
as O
Ellen S-PERSON
| | O
and O
she O
turned O
to O
Ellis's S-PERSON
room O
, O
which O
she O
had O
lately O
very O
often O
frequented O
, O
for O
she O
scarcely O
felt O
comfortable O
when O
Ellen S-PERSON
was O
out O
of O
her O
sight O
, O
though O
she O
had O
full O
confidence O
in O
Ellis's O
care O
. O
Ellen S-PERSON
was O
asleep O
on O
a O
sofa O
, O
looking O
so O
wan O
, O
so O
haggard O
— O
so O
altered O
from O
the O
Ellen S-PERSON
of O
five O
short O
months O
back O
, O
that O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
sat O
down O
by O
her O
side O
, O
pondering O
whether O
she O
was O
doing O
right O
to O
wait O
even O
another B-DATE
week E-DATE
, O
before O
she O
should O
try O
to O
bring O
relief O
by O
avowing O
her O
suspicions O
— O
but O
would O
it O
bring O
relief O
? O
and O
, O
after O
all O
, O
was O
it O
for O
Edward S-PERSON
? O
or O
, O
had O
she O
been O
allowing O
affection O
and O
imagination O
to O
mislead O
and O
soften O
, O
when O
sternness O
might O
still O
be O
needed O
? O
Ellen S-PERSON
woke O
with O
a O
start O
as O
from O
some O
fearful O
dream O
, O
and O
gazed O
at O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
for O
a B-TIME
full I-TIME
minute E-TIME
, O
as O
if O
she O
did O
not O
know O
her O
. O
" O
My O
dear O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
what O
is O
it O
? O
You O
have O
been O
sleeping O
uncomfortably O
— O
surely O
you O
know O
me O
? O
" O
" O
I O
thought O
I O
was O
at O
— O
at O
— O
Seldon B-FAC
Grange E-FAC
— O
are O
you O
sure O
I O
am O
not O
? O
Dear O
aunt O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
do O
tell O
me O
I O
am O
at O
Oakwood S-GPE
, O
I O
know O
I O
am O
to O
go O

very O
soon O

but O
I O
am O
not O
there O
now O
, O
am O
I O
? O
" O
and O
she O
put O
one S-CARDINAL
hand O
to O
her O
forehead O
, O
and O
gazed O
hurriedly O
and O
fearfully O
round O
her O
, O
while O
, O
with O
the O
other O
, O
she O
held O
tightly O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
dress O
. O
There O
was O
something O
alarming O
both O
in O
her O
look O
and O
tone O
. O
" O
No O
, O
love O
, O
you O
are O
with O
me O
still O

been O
with O

little O
time O

You O
can O
not O
think O
I O
would O
send O
you O
away O
now O

Ellen S-PERSON

" O
The O
soothing O
tone O
, O
her O
brother's O
name O
, O
seemed O
to O
disperse O
the O
cloud O
, O
and O
bursting O
into O
tears O

exclaimed O

the O

they O
were O
checked O

in O
increasing O
excitement O

wished O
His O
forgiveness O

I O
must O
prove O
it O
by O
telling O
the O
whole O
to O
you O

whom O
His O
commandments O
desired O
me O
to O
obey O

— O
and O
— O
as O
I O
dared O
not O
do O
that O

I O
have O
been O
afraid O
to O
pray O

" O

the O
shudder O
with O
which O
she O
laid O
her O
head O
again O
upon O
the O
pillow O
, O
betrayed O
the O
misery O
of O
the O
fear O
. O
" O
And O
is O
it O
impossible O
, O
quite O
impossible O
that O
you O
can O
confide O
the O
source O
of O
your O
grief O

difficulty O
to O
me O

Ellen S-PERSON

Will O
you O
not O
do O
so O
, O
even O
if O
I O
promise O
forgiveness O

not O
merely O
to O
you O

to O
all O

may O

Answer O
me O
, O
my O
sweet O
child O

your O
silence O
is O
fearfully O
injuring O
your O
mind O

do O
you O
fancy O
you O
dare O
not O
tell O
me O
? O
" O
" O
Because O
, O
because O
I O
have O
promised O
! O

answered O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
fearful O
tone O
of O
returning O
excitement O
, O
and O
, O
sitting O
upright O
, O
she O
clasped O
her O
hands O
convulsively O
together O
, O
while O
her O
cheek O
burned O
with O
painful O
brilliancy O
. O
" O
Aunt O
Emmeline S-PERSON
— O
oh O
, O
do O
not O
, O
pray O
do O
not O

that O
kind O
tone O

harsh O

cold O
again O

I O
can O
bear O
it O
better O

If O
you O
did O
but O
know O
how O
my O
heart O

ache O

how O
they O
long O
to O

you O

you O
may O
not O

me O
whom O
you O
have O

" O
replied O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
every O
former O
thought O
rendered O
apparently O
null O
and O
vain O
by O
these O
words O
, O
and O
painfully O
disappointing O
her O

but O
the O
answer O
terrified O
her O
. O
" O
Mamma O
— O
I O
promised O
her O
, O
and O
she O
stands O
by O
me O
so O
pale O
, O
so O
grieved O
, O
whenever O
I O
think O
of O
telling O
you O
, O

answered O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
clinging O
to O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
but O
looking O
with O
a O
strained O
gaze O
of O
terror O
on O
vacancy O
. O
" O
I O
thought O
I O
must O

told O
you O

to O
go O

she O
stood O
by O
me O

laid O
her O
hand O
on O
my O
head O

it O
was O
so O
cold O
, O
so O
heavy O
, O
I O
don't O
remember O
any O
thing O
more O
till O
I O
found O
you O

Ellis S-PERSON
leaning O
over O
me O

I O

not O

this O

you O

there O

quite O
close O

me O

her O

forgive O
me O

I O
will O
keep O
my O

shuddering O
convulsively O
, O
she O
hid O
her O
face O
in O
her O
aunt's O
dress O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
was O
dreadfully O
alarmed O

Whatever O
the O
foundation O
, O

she O
had O
no O
doubt O
that O
there O
was O
some O
, O
and O
that O
it O
really O
had O
to O
do O
with O
Edward S-PERSON
and O
his O
poor O
mother's O
mistaken O
partiality O
, O
Ellen's S-PERSON
imagination O
was O
evidently O
disordered O

To O
attempt O
obtaining O
the O
truth O
, O
while O
she O
was O
in O
this O
fearful O
state O
of O
excitement O
, O
was O
as O
impossible O
as O
cruel O
, O
and O
she O
tried O
only O
to O
soothe O
her O
to O
composure O

speaking O
of O
her O
mother O
as O
happy O

in O
Heaven O
and O
that O
Ellen S-PERSON
had O
thought O
of O
her O
so O
much O

as O
was O
quite O
natural O
in O
her O

I O
should O

Mr. O

told O
me O

her O

doing O
what O
I O

she O
wished O
, O
even O
after O
she O
was O
dead O

was O
almost O
a O
pleasure O

more O
joy O

me O
pain O

trouble O

extreme O
severity O

much O

" O
Ellen S-PERSON
made O
no O
answer O

the O
alarming O
excitement O
had O
so O
far O
subsided O
, O
as O
to O
raise O
the O
hope O
that O
quietness O
would O
subdue O
it O
altogether O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
remained O
with O
her O
till O
she O
seemed O
quite O
calm O
, O
and O
would O
not O
have O
left O
her O
then O
, O
but O
he O
had O
promised O
Caroline S-PERSON
to O
drive O
with O
her O
into O
T O
— O
— O
that O
afternoon O
, O
to O
make O
some O
purchases O

Emmeline S-PERSON
and O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
were O
spending O
the O
day O
at O
Greville B-FAC
Manor E-FAC
, O
and O
her O
daughter O
depending O
on O
her O
, O
she O
did O
not O
like O
to O
disappoint O
her O
. O
But O
the O
difficulty O
to O
think O
of O
other O
things O
, O
and O
cheerfully O
converse O
on O
comparatively O
indifferent O
topics O
, O
was O
greater O
than O
she O
had O
ever O
found O
it O
. O
That O
Ellis's S-PERSON
surmise O
was O
correct O
, O
she O
had O
no O
longer O
the O
smallest O
doubt O
. O
Ellen S-PERSON
was O
sacrificing O
herself O
, O
not O
merely O
for O
the O
love O
she O
bore O
her O
brother O
, O
but O
from O
some O
real O
or O
imaginary O
promise O
to O
her O
poor O
mother O
. O
What O
its O
exact O
nature O
was O
, O
she O
could O
not O
indeed O
satisfy O
herself O
, O
but O
that O
it O
had O
something O
to O
do O
with O
concealing O
Edward's S-PERSON
faults O
seemed O
to O
flash O
upon O
her O
, O
she O
hardly O
knew O
how O
. O
Ellis's S-PERSON
words O
" O
that O
she O
had O
seen O
enough O
of O
that O
work O
when O
they O
were O
children O
, O
" O
returned O
to O
her O
, O
and O
various O
incongruities O
in O
Ellen's S-PERSON
character O
and O
conduct O
which O
she O
had O
been O
unable O
to O
reconcile O
at O
the O
time O
, O
all O
seemed O
connected O
with O
it O
. O
But O
to O
arrive O
at O
the O
truth O
was O
much O
more O
difficult O
than O
ever O

still O
, O
how O
could O
she O
send O
Ellen S-PERSON
away O
? O
and O
yet O
, O
if O
still O
silent O
, O
would O
mere O
surmise O
satisfy O
her O
husband O
? O
There O
was O
but O
one S-CARDINAL
hope O
, O
one S-CARDINAL
ray O
of O
light O
— O
Edward's S-PERSON
own O
honor O
, O
if O
indeed O
he O
were O
permitted O
to O
return O

and O
even O
while O
driving O
and O
talking O
with O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
her O
heart O
was O
one S-CARDINAL
fervent O
prayer O
that O
this O
might O
be O
, O
and O
the O
fearful O
struggle O
of O
her O
devoted O
Ellen S-PERSON
cease O
. O
Her O
aunt's O
gentle O
and O
unexpected O
kindness O
had O
had O
such O
a O
beneficial O
effect O
on O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
that O
, O
after O
her O
early O
dinner O
, O
about B-TIME
three I-TIME
o'clock E-TIME
, O
she O
told O
Ellis S-PERSON
she O
would O
go O
in O
the O
school O
- O
room O
, O
and O
try O
and O
read O
there O
for O
an O
hour O

she O
knew O
all O
the O
family O
were O
out O
, O
and O
therefore O
would O
be O
quite O
undisturbed O
. O
Ellis S-PERSON
willingly O
acquiesced O
, O
rejoicing O
that O
she O
should O
seek O
any O
change O
herself O
, O
and O
advised O
her O
, O
as O
it O
was O
such O
a O
mild O
, O
soft O
afternoon O
, O
after O
the O
late O
storms O
, O
to O
take O
a O
turn O
on O
the O
terrace O
, O
on O
which O
a O
glass O
- O
door O
from O
the O
school O
- O
room O
opened O

it O
would O
do O
her O
good O
. O
Ellen S-PERSON
meant O
to O
take O
her O
advice O
, O
but O
as O
she O
looked O
out O
from O
a O
window O
over O
a O
well O
- O
remembered O
landscape O
, O
so O
many O
painful O
thoughts O
and O
recollections O
crowded O
on O
her O
, O
that O
she O
lost O
all O
inclination O
to O
move O
. O
She O
had O
not O
stood O
there O
for O
many B-DATE
weeks E-DATE
, O
and O
it O
seemed O
to O
her O
that O
the O
view O
had O
never O
looked O
so O
very O
lovely O
. O
The O
trees O
all O
had O
the O
last O
glories O
of O
autumn O
— O
for O
it O
was O
early O
in O
November S-DATE
— O
the O
grass O
was O
of O
that O
beautiful O
humid O
emerald O
which O
always O
follows O
heavy O
rain O
, O
and O
though O
the O
summer O

flowers O
had O
all O
gone O
, O
the O
sheltered O
beds O
of O
the O
garden O
, O
lying O
beneath O
the O
terrace O

presented O
many O
very O
beautiful O
still O

The O
end O
of O
the O
terrace O

a O
flight O
of O
stone O
steps O

overlooked O
the O
avenue O
, O
leading O
from O
the O
principal O
lodge O
to O
the O
main O
entrance O
, O
and O
where O
Ellen S-PERSON
stood O
, O
she O
could O
distinguish O
a B-QUANTITY
few I-QUANTITY
yards E-QUANTITY
of O
the O
path O
where O
it O
issued O
from O
some O
distant O
trees O
. O
She O
gazed O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
, O
conscious O
only O
that O
she O
was O
banished O
from O
it O
all O
, O
and O
that O
, O
however O
long O
her O
departure O
might O
be O
deferred O
, O
she O
must O
go O
at O
last O
, O
for O
her O
uncle's O
mandate O
could O
not O
be O
disobeyed O

but O
gradually O
her O
eye O
became O
fixed O
as O
in O
fascination O
. O
A O
single O
figure O
was O
emerging O
from O
the O
trees O
, O
and O
dressed O
in O
the O
uniform O
of O
a O
midshipman O
— O
she O
was O
sure O
it O
was O
! O
but O
it O
was O
a O
figure O
so O
tall O
, O
so O
slim O
, O
his O
step O
so O
lingering O
, O
it O
could O
not O

even O
than O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
but O
so O
much O
slighter O
, O
so O
different O
to O
the O
boy O
from O
whom O
she O
had O
parted O
, O
that O
, O
though O
her O
heart O
bounded O
and O
sunk O
till O
faintness O
seemed O
to O
overpower O
her O
, O
she O
could O
not O
convince O
herself O
it O
was O
he O
. O
With O
an O
almost O
unconscious O
effort O
she O
ran O
out O
, O
through O
the O
glass O
- O
door O
, O
to O
the O
steps O
of O
the O
terrace O
| | O
she O
could O
now O
see O
him O
distinctly O
, O
but O
not O
his O
face O
, O
for O
his O
cap O
was O
low O
over O
his O
forehead O
| | O
but O
as O
he O
approached O
, O
he O
paused O
, O
as O
if O
doubting O
whether O
to O
go O
up O
to O
the O
hall O
door O
, O
or O
the O
well O
- O
known O
terrace O
, O
by O
which O
he O
had O
always O
rushed O
into O
the O
school O
- O
room O
, O
on O
his O
daily O
return O
from O
Mr. O
Howard's S-PERSON

and O
as O
he O
looked O
hastily O
up O
, O
his O
cap O
fell O
back O
, O
and O
his O
eyes O
met O
Ellen's S-PERSON
. O
A O
wild O
but O
checked O
scream O
broke O
from O
her O
lips O
, O
and O
all O
was O
an O
impenetrable O
mist O
till O
she O
found O
herself O
in O
her O
brother's O
arms O
, O
in O
the O
room O
she O
had O
quitted O
, O
his O
lips O
repeatedly O
pressing O
her O
cheek O
and O
forehead O
, O
and O
his O
voice O
, O
which O
sounded O
so O
strange O
— O
it O
did O
not O
seem O
like O
Edward's S-PERSON
, O
it O
was O
so O
much O
more O
deep O
and O
manly O
— O
entreating O
her O
to O
speak O
to O
him O
, O
and O
tell O
him O
why O
she O
looked O
so O
ill O
| | O
but O
still O
her O
heart O
so O
throbbed O
she O
could O
not O
speak O
. O
She O
could O
only O
cling O
close O
to O
him O
and O
look O
intently O
in O
his O
face O
, O
which O
was O
so O
altered O
from O
the O
happy O
, O
laughing O
boy O
, O
that O
had O
he O
not O
been O
, O
from O
his O
extreme O
paleness O
and O
attenuation O
of O
feature O
, O
still O
more O
like O
their O
mother O
when O
she O
was O
ill O
, O
his O
sister O
would O
scarcely O
have O
known O
him O
. O
" O

such O
dreadful O
things O

the O
reason O

deadly O

told O
at O
the O
lodge O
of O
her O
nephew's O
arrival O

powerful O
was O

emotion O

that O

leaned O
back O
in O

carriage O

as O
it O
drove O
rapidly O
from O
the O
lodge O
to O

Hall S-FAC

without O
the O
power O
of O
uttering O
a O
word O
. O
Caroline S-PERSON
was O
surprised O
, O
for O
his O
return O
seemed O
to O
her O
only O
a O
cause O
of O
rejoicing O

she O
had O
no O
idea O
of O
the O
mingled O
dread O

joy O
, O
the O
trembling O
, O
lest O
Edward S-PERSON
had O
indeed O
deceived O
them O
all O

not O

the O
redoubled O
mystery O
of O
Ellen's S-PERSON
conduct O
. O
While O
he O
was O
absent O
she O
could O
think O
calmly O
on O
him O
as O
the O
cause O
of O
all O
, O
but O
now O
that O
he O
was O
returned O
, O
her O
heart O
seemed O
to O
turn O
sick O
with O
apprehension O
, O
and O
she O
had O
hardly O
strength O
to O
inquire O
where O
he O
was O
, O
and O

her O
surprise O
when O
she O
found O
his O
arrival O

Caroline's S-PERSON
joyful O
exclamation O
as O
she O
ran O
into O
the O
school O
- O
room O
to O
put O
away O
some O
of O
her O
purchases O

drew O
her O
there O
at O
once O

and O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
five B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
the O
intense O
thankfulness O
that O
he O
was O
indeed O
safe O
and O
comparatively O
well O
— O
that O
whatever O
might O

his O
affection O
for O

to O
judge O
by O
the O
warmth O
, O
and O
agitation O
of O
his O
embrace O
, O
was O
unchanged O
, O
and O
she O
had O
that O
to O
work O
on O
, O
alone O
occupied O
her O
mind O
and O
enabled O
her O
to O
regain O
her O
calmness O
. O
" O
You O
do O
indeed O
look O
as O

my O
dear O

she O
said O
, O
after O
some O
little O
time O
had O
elapsed O
, O
and O
Edward S-PERSON
had O
seated O
himself O
by O
her O
, O
his O
hand O
still O
clasped O
in O
hers O

" O
Sir O
Edward S-PERSON
was O
quite O
right O
to O
invalid O
you O
. O
Emmeline S-PERSON
does O
nothing O
but O
talk O
of O
your O
wounds O
as O
making O
you O
a O
complete O
hero O

I O
am O
unromantic O
enough O
to O
wish O
that O
you O
had O
brought O
me O
home O
more O
color O
and O
more O
flesh O
, O
and O
less O
glory O

but O
, O
I O
suppose O
from O
being O
so O
pale O
, O
you O
are O
more O
like O
your O
poor O
mother O
than O
ever O

and O
she O
looked O
at O
him O
so O
earnestly O
, O
that O
Edward's S-PERSON
eyes O
, O
spite O
of O
all O
his O
efforts O
, O
sunk O
beneath O
hers O
. O
He O
answered O
gayly O
, O
however O
, O
and O
, O
in O
reply O
to O
Caroline's S-PERSON
numerous O
queries O
, O
entered O
into O
an O
animated O
description O
of O
their O
voyage O
home O
and O
the O
causes O
of O
their O
detention O
, O
in O
their O
being O
so O
often O
compelled O
to O
put O
into O
port O
from O
the O
fearful O
storms O
they O
had O
encountered O
, O
and O
time O
slipped O
away O
so O
fast O
that O
the O
dinner O
- O
bell O
rung O
before O
any O
one O
was O
prepared O
. O
That O
Ellen S-PERSON
should O
look O
paler O
than O
even O
when O
she O
had O
left O
her O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
and O
be O
still O
more O
silent O
, O
did O
not O
astonish O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
| | O
the O
agitation O
of O
meeting O
her O
brother O
was O
quite O
enough O
to O
occasion O
it O
| | O
and O
she O
advised O
her O
to O
remain O
quiet O
while O
they O
were O
at O
dinner O
, O
that O
she O
might O
rejoin O
them O
afterward O
. O
She O
looked O
as O
if O
she O
had O
been O
so O
very O
lately O
ill O
, O
that O
Edward S-PERSON
was O
not O
surprised O
at O
her O
having O
dined O
already O
| | O
but O
many O
little O
things O
that O
occured O
during O
the O
evening O
— O
her O
excessive O
quietness O
, O
the O
evident O
restraint O
between O
her O
and O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
and O
, O
he O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
fancied O
, O
and O
then O
was O
quite O
certain O
, O
between O
her O
and O
his O
aunt O
, O
startled O
and O
perplexed O
him O
. O
She O
seemed O
restrained O
and O
shy O
, O
too O
, O
with O
him O
, O
as O
if O
in O
constant O
terror O
. O
Poor O
child O
! O
her O
aunt O
had O
advised O
quietness O
while O
alone O
, O
and O
her O
brother's O
words O
rung O
in O
her O
ears O
, O
till O
repose O
seemed O
farther O
off O
than O
ever O
. O
After O
all O
she O
had O
suffered O
before O
, O
and O
after O
the O
sending O
that O
fatal O
letter O
, O
it O
had O
never O
reached O
him O
: O
she O
had O
utterly O
failed O
in O
her O
attempt O
to O
save O
him O
. O
If O
she O
had O
, O
indeed O
, O
confided O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
in O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
measures O
would O
have O
been O
taken O
, O
she O
was O
sure O
, O
to O
have O
secured O
him O
the O
necessary O
relief O
, O
for O
whenever O
her O
uncle O
had O
sent O
him O
his O
allowance O
it O
was O
through O
Sir O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
not O
encountering O
the O
risk O
of O
the O
loss O
of O
the O
letter O
. O
There O
had O
been O
times O
when O
, O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
her O
sufferings O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
could O
realize O
a O
sort O
of O
comfort O
in O
the O
idea O
that O
she O
had O
saved O
Edward S-PERSON
and O
kept O
his O
secret O
| | O
but O
where O
was O
this O
comfort O
now O
? O
All O
she O
had O
endured O
all O
she O
was O
still O
to O
endure O
, O
was O
for O
nothing O
, O
worse O
than O
nothing O
| | O
for O
if O
Edward S-PERSON
knew O
her O
sin O
, O
feeling O
that O
it O
had O
brought O
him O
no O
good O
, O
and O
given O
up O
, O
as O
she O
felt O
he O
must O
be O
, O
to O
unrestrained O
passion O
, O
or O
he O
could O
not O
have O
given O
vent O
to O
such O
fearful O
sentiments O
, O
she O
actually O
trembled O
for O
its O
effect O
upon O
him O
and O
his O
anger O
on O
herself O
. O
She O
had O
sometimes O
fancied O
that O
, O
perhaps O
, O
his O
errors O
were O
not O
so O
great O
as O
he O
believed O
them O
, O
that O
he O
would O
confess O
them O
when O
he O
found O
only O
his O
kind O
, O
indulgent O
aunt O
at O
home O
, O
and O
so O
peace O
and O
hope O
gradually O
dawn O
for O
both O
him O
and O
her O
. O
All O
her O
wish O
, O
her O
hope O
now O
was O
that O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
could O
be O
prevailed O
upon O
not O
to O
tell O
him O
what O
she O
had O
done O
, O
for O
whether O
it O
made O
him O
think O
he O
ought O
to O
confess O
himself O
its O
cause O
or O
not O
, O
its O
effect O
on O
him O
would O
be O
so O
terrible O
, O
that O
she O
felt O
any O
additional O
suffering O
to O
herself O
could O
be O
better O
borne O
. O
With O
these O
thoughts O
, O
no O
wonder O
she O
was O
silent O
, O
utterly O
unable O
to O
subdue O
them O
as O
she O
wished O
, O
and O
evince O
natural O
interest O
in O
all O
that O
had O
occurred O
to O
Edward S-PERSON
| | O
and O
tell O
him O
all O
that O
had O
happened O
to O
herself O
during O
their O
long O
separation O
. O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
however O
, O
was O
so O
animated O
| | O
and O
when O
Emmeline S-PERSON
and O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
returned O
, O
unable O
to O
comprehend O
what O
they O
could O
possibly O
be O
sent O
for O
, O
a B-TIME
full I-TIME
hour E-TIME
earlier O
than O
usual O
, O
the O
astonishment O
and O
delight O
at O
seeing O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
prevented O
any O
thing O
like O
a O
pause O
in O
conversation O
, O
or O
unnatural O
restraint O
. O
His O
cousins O
found O
so O
much O
to O
tell O
as O
well O
as O
to O
listen O
to O
, O
about O
Percy S-PERSON
and O
Herbert S-PERSON
, O
as O
well O
as O
themselves O
| | O
and O
Emmeline S-PERSON
made O
Edward S-PERSON
tell O
her O
such O
minute O
particulars O
of O
their O
engagements O
with O
the O
pirates O
, O
and O
how O
he O
was O
wounded O
, O
and O
what O
Sir O
Edward S-PERSON
said O
to O
him O
, O
that O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
anxious O
as O
she O
was O
— O
for O
the O
longer O
she O
was O
with O
her O
nephew O
, O
the O
more O
convinced O
she O
was O
that O
he O
could O
not O
meet O
her O
eye O
, O
and O
that O
his O
gayety O
was O
not O
natural O
— O
could O
not O
help O
being O
amused O
in O
spite O
of O
herself O
. O
Engrossed O
with O
thought O
how O
to O
arrive O
at O
the O
truth O
, O
for O
which O
she O
ardently O
longed O
, O
she O
entered O
the O
library O
, O
when O
the O
prayer O
- O
bell O
rung O
, O
with O
her O
children O
| | O
quite O
forgetting O
, O
till O
she O
had O
taken O
the O
place O
at O
the O
reading O
- O
desk O
, O
which O
, O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
her O
husband O
and O
sons O
, O
she O
always O
occupied O
herself O
, O
that O
she O
had O
intended O
to O
desire O
Ellen S-PERSON
to O
resume O
her O
usual O
place O
by O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
wishing O
to O
spare O
her O
any O
additional O
suffering O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
night O
of O
Edward's S-PERSON
return O
, O
and O
to O
prevent O
any O
painful O
feeling O
on O
his O
part O
. O
It O
was O
an O
oversight O
, O
but O
it O
vexed O
her O
exceedingly O
. O
She O
looked O
hastily O
round O
, O
in O
the O
hope O
of O
being O
in O
time O
, O
but O
Ellen S-PERSON
was O
already O
in O
her O
place O
, O
though O
she O
had O
evidently O
shrunk O
still O
more O
into O
the O
recess O
of O
the O
lower O
window O
, O
as O
if O
longing O
for O
its O
massive O
curtains O
to O
hide O
her O
, O
and O
her O
face O
was O
buried O
in O
her O
hands O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
would O
have O
been O
still O
more O
grieved O
, O
if O
she O
had O
seen O
, O
as O
Ellis S-PERSON
did O
, O
the O
beseeching O
, O
humble O
look O
, O
which O
, O
as O
they O
entered O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
had O
fixed O
upon O
her O
, O
and O
that O
her O
pale O
lips O
had O
quivered O
with O
the O
half O
- O
uttered O
supplication O
, O
which O
she O
failed O
in O
courage O
to O
fully O
pronounce O
. O
Edward S-PERSON
appeared O
too O
wrapped O
in O
his O
own O
thoughts O
to O
notice O
it O
then O
| | O
and O
as O
his O
aunt's O
gentle O
but O
impressive O
voice O
fell O
on O
his O
fear O
, O
the O
words O
, O
the O
room O
, O
the O
whole O
scene O
so O
recalled O
the O
happy O
, O
and O
comparatively O
innocent O
past O
, O
that O
it O
was O
with O
difficulty O
he O
could O
restrain O
his O
feelings O
, O
till O
the O
attitude O
of O
kneeling O
permitted O
them O
full O
vent O
in O
tears O
, O
actual O
tears O
, O
when O
he O
had O
thought O
he O
could O
never O
weep O
again O
. O
The O
contrast O
of O
his O
past O
and O
present O
self O
, O
rendered O
the O
one O
more O
brightly O
happy O
, O
the O
other O
more O
intensely O
dark O
than O
the O
actual O
reality O
. O
The O
unchecked O
faults O
and O
passions O
of O
his O
early O
childhood O
had O
been O
the O
sole O
cause O
of O
his O
present O
errors O
| | O
but O
, O
while O
under O
the O
gentle O
control O
of O
his O
aunt O
and O
uncle O
, O
and O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
, O
he O
had O
not O
known O
these O
faults O
, O
and O
, O
therefore O
, O
believed O
they O
had O
all O
come O
since O
. O
He O
longed O
intensely O
to O
confide O
all O
his O
errors O
, O
all O
his O
remorse O
, O
to O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
, O
whom O
he O
still O
so O
dearly O
loved O
| | O
but O
he O
knew O
he O
had O
not O
courage O
to O
confess O
, O
and O
yet O
hated O
himself O
for O
his O
cowardice O
. O
Only O
too O
well O
accustomed O
to O
control O
, O
he O
banished O
every O
trace O
of O
tears O
( O
from O
all O
save O
the O
eye O
rendered O
even O
more O
than O
usually O
penetrating O
from O
anxiety O
) O
, O
as O
he O
arose O
, O
and O
became O
aware O
, O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
, O
that O
Ellen S-PERSON
was O
not O
where O
he O
was O
accustomed O
to O
see O
her O
. O
He O
kissed O
her O
fondly O
as O
she O
hurriedly O
approached O
him O
| | O
but O
perceiving O
she O
left O
the O
room O
with O
merely O
a O
faint O
good O
- O
night O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
family O
, O
and O
no O
embrace O
, O
as O
usual O
, O
from O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
he O
darted O
forward O
, O
seized O
his O
aunt's O
hand O
, O
and O
exclaimed O
— O
" O
What O
is O
the O
matter O
with O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
aunt O
Emmeline S-PERSON
? O
Why O
is O
she O
so O
changed O
, O
and O
why O
is O
your O
manner O
to O
her O
so O
cold O
and O
distant O
? O
and O
why O
did O
she O
kneel O
apart O
, O
as O
if O
unworthy O
to O
join O
us O
even O
in O
prayers O

Tell O
me O
, O
for O
pity's O
sake O
! O
" O
" O
Not O
to O
- O
night O
, O
my O
dear O

" O
Edward S-PERSON
was O
compelled O

retire O

though O
he O
did O

sufficient O

the O
comfort O
of O
his O
room O

luxurious O

, O
however O
varied O
the O

Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
discovered O
a O
note O

her O
dressing O

table O

She O
thought O
she O
knew O
the O
writing O

from O
tremulousness O
it O
was O
so O
nearly O
illegible O
, O
that O
it O
was O
with O
great O
difficulty O
she O
deciphered O
the O
following O
words O
: O
" O
I O
am O
so O
conscious O

Ellen S-PERSON

" O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
eyes O
filled O
with O
tears O

the O
word O
" O
your O

evidently O
been O
written O
originally O
, O

partially O
erased O

and O
" O
the O
" O
substituted O
in O
its O

she O
could O
not O

utter O
desolation O
of O
one O
so O
young O

which O
that O
simple O

betrayed O

without O
increase O
of O
pain O

yet O
to O
grant O
her O

It O
puzzled O
her O

so O
persist O
in O
the O

heart O

urge O
him O

She O
locked O
up O
the O

not O

again O

fearing O
its O

night O
passed O

breakfast O

, O
Edward S-PERSON

his O

were O
alone O
together O
in O
the O
library O

It O
was O
with O
the O
utmost O
difficulty O
, O
he O
suppressed O
, O
sufficiently O
to O
conceal O
, O
the O
fearful O
agitation O
which O
thrilled O
through O
every O
nerve O
as O
he O
listened O
to O
the O
tale O
he O
had O
demanded O

He O
could O
not O
doubt O
the O
use O
to O
which O
that O
money O
had O
been O
applied O
. O
His O
sister's O
silence O
alone O
would O
have O
confirmed O
it O

but O
in O
that B-TIME
hour E-TIME
of O
madness O
— O
for O
what O
else O
is O
passion O
unrestrained O
by O
principle O
or O
feeling O
? O
— O
he O
was O
only O
conscious O
of O
anger O
, O
fierce O
anger O
against O
the O
unhappy O
girl O
who O
had O
borne O
so O
much O
for O
him O
. O
He O
had O
utterly O
forgotten O
the O
desperate O
words O

had O
written O

He O
had O
never O
received O
the O
intended O
relief O

Till O
within O
a O
week O
, O
a B-DATE
short I-DATE
week E-DATE
of O
his O
return O
, O
he O
had O
been O
in O
Harding's S-GPE
power O
, O
and O
as O
Ellen's S-PERSON
devotion O
had O
saved O
him O
nothing O
, O
what O
could O
it O
weigh O
against O
the O
maddening O
conviction O
, O
that O
if O
he O
had O
one S-CARDINAL
spark O
of O
honor O
remaining O
, O
he O
must O
confess O
that O
he O
had O
caused O
her O
sin O
? O
Instead O
of O
saving O
, O
she O
had O
betrayed O
him O

and O
he O
left O
his O
aunt O
to O
seek O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
so O
evidently O
disturbed O
and O
heated O
, O
and O
the O
interview O
itself O
had O
been O
so O
little O
satisfactory O
in O
softening O
him O
, O
as O
, O
she O
had O
hoped O
to O
win O
him O
to O
confession O
at O
once O
, O
for O
she O
had O
purposely O
spoken O
as O
indulgently O
of O
error O
and O
difficulty O
as O
she O
could O
, O
without O
betraying O
her O
strengthened O
suspicions O
, O
that O
if O
she O
had O
known O
how O
to O
do O
so O
, O
she O
would O
have O
forbidden O
his O
seeing O
Ellen S-PERSON
till O
he O
was O
more O
calm O
. O
Unhappily O
, O
too O
, O
it O
was O
that O
part O
of O
the O
day O
when O
Ellis S-PERSON
was O
always O
most O
engaged O
, O
and O
she O
was O
not O
even O
in O
her O
own O
room O
, O
so O
that O
there O
was O
no O
check O
on O
Edward's S-PERSON
violence O
. O
The O
control O
he O
had O
exercised O
while O
with O
his O
aunt O
but O
increased O
passion O
when O
it O
was O
removed O
. O
He O
poured O
forth O
the O
bitterest O
reproaches O
— O
asked O
how O
she O
could O
dare O
hope O
relief O
so O
obtained O
, O
would O
ever O
have O
been O
allowed O
to O
reach O
him O
? O
— O
what O
had O
she O
done O
but O
betrayed O
him O
? O
for O
how O
could O
he O
be O
such O
a O
dishonored O
coward O
as O
to O
let O
her O
leave O
Oakwood S-GPE
because O
she O
would O
not O
speak O
? O
and O
why O
had O
she O
not O
spoken O
? O
— O
why O
not O
betrayed O
him O
at O
once O
, O
and O
not O
decoyed O
him O
home O
to O
disgrace O
and O
misery O
? O
Passion O
had O
so O
maddened O
him O
that O
he O
neither O
knew O
what O
he O
said O
himself O
, O
nor O
heard O
her O
imploring O
entreaties O
not O
to O
betray O
himself O
and O
she O
never O
would O
. O
She O
clung O
to O
his O
knees O
as O
she O
kneeled O
before O
him O
, O
for O
she O
was O
too O
powerless O
to O
stand O
, O
reiterating O
her O
supplication O
in O
a O
tone O
that O
ought O
to O
have O
recalled O
him O
to O
his O
better O
self O
, O
but O
that O
better O
self O
had O
been O
too O
long O
silenced O
, O
and O
infuriated O
at O
her O
convulsive O
efforts O
to O
detain O
him O
, O
he O
struck O
her O
with O
sufficient O
force O
to O
make O
her O
, O
more O
by O
the O
agony O
of O
a O
blow O
from O
him O
, O
than O
the O
pain O
itself O
, O
loose O
her O
hold O
at O
once O
, O
and O
darted O
from O
the O
room O
. O
The O
hall O
door O
was O
open O
, O
and O
he O
rushed O
through O
it O
unseen O
into O
the O
park O
, O
flying O
he O
neither O
knew O
where O
nor O
cared O
, O
but O
plunging O
into O
the O
wildest O
parts O
. O
How O
he O
arrived O
at O
one S-CARDINAL
particular O
spot O
he O
knew O
not O
, O
for O
it O
was O
one O
which O
of O
all O
others O
, O
in O
that O
moment O
of O
excitement O
, O
he O
would O
gladly O
have O
avoided O
. O
It O
was O
a O
small O
glade O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
the O
wood O
, O
shelving O
down O
to O
the O
water's O
edge O
, O
where O
he O
and O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
with O
the O
assistance O
of O
Robert S-PERSON
, O
had O
been O
permitted O
to O
erect O
a O
miniature O
boat O
- O
house O
, O
and O
where O
Edward S-PERSON
had O
kept O
a O
complete O
flotilla O
of O
tiny O
vessels O
. O
There O
were O
the O
trees O
, O
the O
glade O
, O
the O
boat O
- O
house O
still O
, O
aye O
, O
and O
the O
vessels O
, O
in O
such O
beautiful O
repair O
and O
keeping O
, O
that O
it O
brought O
back O
the O
past O
so O
vividly O
, O
so O
overpoweringly O
, O
from O
the O
voiceless O
proof O
which O
it O
was O
of O
the O
affectionate O
remembrance O
with O
which O
he O
and O
his O
favorite O
tastes O
had O
been O
regarded O
, O
even O
in O
his O
absence O
, O
that O
he O
could O
not O
bear O
it O
. O
He O
flung O
himself O
full O
length O
on O
the O
greensward O
, O
and O
as O
thought O
after O
thought O
came O
back O
upon O
him O
, O
bringing O
Ellen S-PERSON
before O
him O
, O
self O
- O
sacrificing O
, O
devoted O
, O
always O
interposing O
between O
him O
and O
anger O
, O
as O
she O
had O
done O
from O
the B-TIME
first I-TIME
hour E-TIME
they O
had O
been O
inmates O
of O
Oakwood S-GPE
, O
the O
thought O
of O
that O
craven O
blow O
, O
those O
mad O
reproaches O
, O
was O
insupportable O
| | O
and O
he O
sobbed O
for O
nearly B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour E-TIME
in O
that O
one S-CARDINAL
spot O
, O
longing O
that O
some O
chance O
would O
but O
bring O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
to O
him O
, O
that O
he O
might O
relieve O
that O
fearful O
remorse O
at O
once O
| | O
but O
utterly O
unable O
to O
seek O
him O
of O
himself O
. O
Edward's S-PERSON
disposition O
, O
like O
his O
mother's O
, O
was O
naturally O
much O
too O
good O
for O
the O
determined O
pursuit O
of O
evil O
. O
His O
errors O
had O
actually O
been O
much O
less O
grave O
, O
than O
from O
Harding's S-PERSON
artful O
representations O
he O
imagined O
them O
. O
He O
never O
indulged O
in O
passion O
without O
its O
being O
followed O
by O
the O
most O
agonized O
remorse O
| | O
but O
from O
having O
pertinaciously O
banished O
the O
religion O
which O
his O
aunt O
had O
so O
tried O
to O
instill O
, O
and O
been O
taught O
by O
Harding S-PERSON
to O
scoff O
at O
the O
only O
safe O
guide O
for O
youth O
, O
as O
for O
every O
age O
, O
God's S-PERSON
holy O
word O
, O
he O
had O
nothing O
whereon O
to O
lean O
, O
either O
as O
a O
comfort O
in O
his O
remorse O
, O
a O
hope O
for O
amendment O
, O
or O
strength O
for O
self O
- O
conquest O
| | O
and O
terrible O
indeed O
might O
have O
been O
the O
consequences O
of O
Harding's O
fatal O
influence O
, O
if O
the O
influence O
of O
a O
home O
of O
love O
had O
not O
been O
still O
stronger O
. O
Two B-TIME
hours E-TIME
after O
he O
had O
quitted O
his O
aunt O
, O
he O
rejoined O
the O
family O
, O
tranquil O
, O
but O
bearing O
such O
evident O
traces O
of O
a O
mental O
struggle O
, O
at O
least O
so O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
fancied O
, O
for O
no O
one O
else O
noticed O
it O
, O
that O
she O
still O
hoped O
she O
did O
not O
exactly O
know O
what O
, O
for O
she O
failed O
in O
courage O
to O
ask O
the O
issue O
of O
his O
interview O
with O
Ellen S-PERSON
. O
She O
contented O
herself O
with O
desiring O
Emmeline S-PERSON
to O
tell O
her O
cousin O
to O
bring O
her O
work O
or O
drawing O
, O
and O
join O
them O
, O
and O
she O
was O
so O
surprised O
, O
when O
Emmeline S-PERSON
brought O
back O
word O
that O
Ellen S-PERSON
had O
said O
she O
had O
much O
rather O
not O
, O
that O
she O
sought O
her O
herself O
. O
Ellen's S-PERSON
cheeks O
, O
in O
general O
so O
pale O
, O
were O
crimson O
, O
her O
eyes O
in O
consequence O
unnaturally O
brilliant O
, O
and O
she O
looked O
altogether O
so O
unlike O
herself O
, O
that O
her O
aunt O
was O
more O
anxious O
than O
ever O
| | O
nor O
did O
her O
manner O
when O
asked O
why O
she O
refused O
to O
join O
them O
, O
when O
Edward S-PERSON
had O
so O
lately O
returned O
, O
tend O
to O
decrease O
the O
feeling O
. O
" O
Emmeline S-PERSON
did O
not O
say O
you O
desired O
it O
, O
or O
I O
should O
have O
known O
better O
than O
disobey O
, O
" O
was O
her O
reply O
, O
and O
it O
was O
scarcely O
disrespectful O
| | O
the O
tone O
seemed O
that O
of O
a O
spirit O
, O
crushed O
and O
goaded O
to O
the O
utmost O
, O
and O
so O
utterly O
unable O
to O
contend O
more O
, O
though O
every O
nerve O
was O
quivering O
with O
pain O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
felt O
bitter O
pain O
that O
Ellen S-PERSON
at O
length O
did O
indeed O
shrink O
from O
her O
| | O
that O
the O
disregard O
of O
her O
entreaty O
concerning O
her O
brother O
appeared O
so O
to O
have O
wounded O
, O
that O
it O
had O
shaken O
the O
affection O
which O
no O
other O
suffering O
had O
had O
power O
to O
move O
. O
" O
I O
do O
not O
desire O
it O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
though O
I O
wish O
it O
, O
" O
she O
replied O
, O
mildly O

" O
you O
are O
of O
course O
at O
liberty O
to O
act O
as O
you O

I O
should O
have O
thought O
it O
most O
natural O
that O
, O
not O
having O
been O
with O
Edward S-PERSON
so O
long O
, O
you O
should O
wish O

me O

for O

it O

Ellen S-PERSON

you O
shall O
go O
next B-DATE

I O
did O
not O
imagine O
that O
under O
any O
circumstances O
, O
you O
could O
have O
expressed O
a O
desire O

leave O
me O

it O
would O
make O
me O

you O
away O

it O

the O
only O
— O
only O
favor O
I O
asked O
you O
before O
I O
went O
, O
" O
answered O
poor O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
and O
the O
voice O
, O
which O
had O
been O
unnaturally O
clear O
, O
was O
choked O
for O
the O
moment O
with O
sobs O
, O
which O
she O
resolutely O
forced O
back O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
could O
scarcely O
bear O
it O
| | O
taking O
her O
ice O
- O
cold O
hands O
in O
both O
hers O
, O
she O
said O
, O
almost O
tenderly O
— O
" O
You O
have O
reason O
to O
condemn O
me O
as O
harsh O
and O
cruel O
Ellen S-PERSON
| | O
but O
time O
will O
perhaps O
explain O
the O
motives O
of O
my O
conduct O
, O
as O
I O
trust O
and O
pray O
it O
will O
solve O
the O
mystery O
of O
yours O

you O
are O
not O
well O
enough O
to O
be O
left O
long O
alone O
, O
and O
Ellis S-PERSON
is O
so O
much O
engaged O
to O
- O
day O
that O
I O
do O
wish O
you O
to O
be O
with O
me O
, O
independent O
of O
your O
brother's O
society O
. O
If O
you O
so O
much O
prefer O
remaining O
here O
, O
I O
will O
stay O
with O
you O
, O
though O
of O
course O
, O
as O
Edward S-PERSON
has O
been O
away O
from O
us O
so O
long O
, O
I O
should O
wish O
to O
be O
with O
him O
also O
. O
" O
It O
was O
almost O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
had O
ever O
had O
recourse O
in O
the O
management O
of O
her O
family O
to O
any O
thing O
that O
was O
not O
perfectly O
straightforward O
| | O
and O
though O
her O
present O
motives O
would O
have O
hallowed O
much O
deeper O
stratagems O
, O
her O
pure O
mind O
shrunk O
from O
her O
own O
words O
. O
She O
wished O
Ellen S-PERSON
to O
be O
constantly O
in O
Edward's S-PERSON
presence O
, O
that O
he O
might O
not O
be O
able O
to O
evade O
the O
impulse O
of O
feeling O
and O
honor O
, O
which O
the O
sight O
of O
such O
suffering O
, O
she O
thought O
, O
must O
call O
forth O
| | O
she O
could O
not O
bear O
to O
enforce O
this O
wish O
as O
a O
command O
, O
when O
she O
had O
already O
been O
, O
as O
she O
felt O
— O
if O
Ellen's S-PERSON
silence O
were O
indeed O
self O
- O
devotion O
, O
not O
guilt O
— O
so O
cruelly O
and O
so O
unnecessarily O
severe O
. O
Ellen S-PERSON
made O
neither O
reply O
nor O
resistance O
, O
but O
, O
taking O
up O
her O
work O
, O
accompanied O
her O
aunt O
to O
the O
usual O
morning O
- O
room O
, O
from O
which O
many O
a O
burst O
of O
happy O
laughter O
, O
and O
joyous O
tones O
were O
echoing O
. O
Caroline S-PERSON
and O
Emmeline S-PERSON
were O
so O
full O
of O
enjoyment O
at O
Edward's S-PERSON
return O
, O
had O
so O
many O
things O
to O
ask O
and O
tell O
, O
were O
so O
perfectly O
unsuspicious O
as O
to O
his O
having O
any O
concern O
with O
his O
sister's O
fault O
, O
that O
if O
they O
did O
once O
or O
twice O
think O
him O
less O
lively O
and O
joyous O
, O
than O
when O
he O
left O
home O
, O
they O
attributed O
it O
simply O
, O
to O
his O
not O
having O
yet O
recovered O
the O
exhausting O
voyage O
and O
his O
wounds O
. O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
, O
just O
as O
unsuspicious O
, O
secretly O
accused O
Ellen S-PERSON
as O
the O
cause O
of O
his O
occasional O
abstraction O
: O
her O
conduct O
was O
not O
likely O
to O
pass O
unfelt O
by O
one O
so O
upright O
, O
so O
honorable O
, O
and O
if O
he O
had O
been O
harsh O
with O
her O
, O
as O
from O
Ellen's S-PERSON
fearfully O
shrinking O
manner O
, O
and O
complete O
silence O
when O
they O
were O
together O
, O
she O
fancied O
, O
she O
thought O
it O
was O
so O
deserved O
, O
that O
she O
had O
no O
pity O
for O
her O
whatever O
. O
The O
day O
passed O
briskly O
and O
happily O
enough O
, O
in O
seeming O
to O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
and O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
in O
reality O
to O
all O
the O
other O
members O
of O
the O
party O
— O
but O
one O
. O
The O
great O
subject O
of O
regret O
was O
Mr. O
Howard's S-PERSON
absence O
, O
he O
might O
be O
back O
at O
the O
rectory O
that O
evening O
, O
and O
Emmeline S-PERSON
was O
sure O
he O
would O
come O
to O
see O
Edward S-PERSON
directly O
. O
As O
the O
hours O
waned O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
became O
sensible O
of O
a O
sharp O
and O
most O
unusual O
pain O
darting O
through O
her O
temples O
, O
and O
gradually O
extending O
over O
her O
forehead O
and O
head O
, O
till O
she O
could O
scarcely O
move O
her O
eyes O
. O
It O
had O
come O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
so O
suddenly O
, O
and O
lasting O
so O
short O
a O
time O
, O
that O
she O
could O
scarcely O
define O
what O
it O
was O
, O
or O
why O
she O
should O
have O
felt O
so O
suddenly O
sick O
and O
faint O
| | O
but O
it O
increased O
, O
till O
there O
was O
no O
difficulty O
in O
tracing O
it O
, O
and O
before O
prayer O
- O
time O
, O
had O
become O
such O
fearful O
agony O
, O
that O
, O
if O
she O
had O
not O
been O
inured O
to O
pain O
of O
all O
kinds O
, O
and O
endowed O
with O
extraordinary O
fortitude O
and O
control O
, O
she O
must O
more O
than O
once O
have O
betrayed O
it O
by O
either O
giving O
way O
to O
faintness O
, O
or O
screaming O
aloud O
. O
She O
had O
overheard O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
desire O
Robert S-PERSON
to O
request O
Mr. O
Maitland S-PERSON
to O
come O
to O
Oakwood S-GPE
as O
soon O
as O
he O
could O
, O
and O
not O
hearing O
the O
reply O
that O
he O
was O
not O
expected O
home O
till O
late B-TIME
at I-TIME
night E-TIME
, O
expected O
him O
every O
moment O
, O
and O
thought O
he O
would O
give O
her O
something O
to O
relieve O
it O
, O
without O
her O
complaining O
. O
Edward S-PERSON
had O
asked O
his O
cousins O
for O
some O
music O
, O
and O
then O
to O
please O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
had O
sketched O
the O
order O
of O
their O
engagement O
with O
the O
pirates O
, O
and O
no O
one O
noticed O
her O
, O
for O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
heart O
was O
sinking O
with O
disappointed O
hope O
, O
as O
the O
hours O
passed O
, O
and O
there O
was O
no O
sign O
to O
prove O
that O
her O
surmise O
was O
correct O
, O
and O
if O
it O
were O
, O
that O
the O
truth O
would O
be O
obtained O
. O
The O
prayer O
- O
bell O
rang O
, O
and O
as O
they O
rose O
, O
Edward's S-PERSON
eyes O
, O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
since O
she O
had O
joined O
them O
, O
sought O
and O
fixed O
themselves O
on O
his O
sister's O
face O
. O
The O
paroxysm O
of O
pain O
had O
for O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes E-TIME
subsided O
, O
as O
it O
had O
done O
alternately O
with O
violence O
all O
day O
, O
but O
it O
had O
left O
her O
so O
ghastly O
pale O
, O
that O
he O
started O
in O
actual O
terror O
. O
It O
might O
have O
been O
fancy O
, O
but O
he O
thought O
there O
was O
the O
trace O
of O
his O
cowardly O
blow O
on O
her O
pale O
forehead O
, O
raised O
, O
and O
black O
, O
and O
such O
a O
feeling O
of O
agony O
and O
remorse O
rushed O
over O
him O
, O
that O
it O
was O
with O
difficulty O
he O
restrained O
himself O
from O
catching O
her O
in O
his O
arms O
, O
and O
beseeching O
her O
forgiveness O
before O
them O
all O
| | O
but O
there O
was O
no O
time O
then O
, O
and O
they O
proceeded O
to O
the O
library O
. O
Every O
step O
Ellen S-PERSON
took O
appeared O
to O
bring O
back O
that O
fearful O
pain O
, O
till O
as O
she O
sat O
down O
, O
and O
then O
knelt O
in O
her O
place O
, O
she O
was O
sensible O
of O
nothing O
else O
. O
The O
service O
was O
over O
| | O
and O
as O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
rose O
from O
the O
private O
prayer O
, O
with O
which O
each O
individual O
concluded O
his O
devotions O
, O
her O
nephew O
stood O
before O
her O
, O
white O
as O
marble O
, O
but O
with O
an O
expression O
of O
fixed O
resolution O
, O
which O
made O
her O
heart O
bound O
up O
with O
hope O
, O
at O
the O
very O
moment O
it O
turned O
sick O
and O
faint O
with O
terror O
. O
Several O
of O
the O
lower O
domestics O
had O
quitted O
the O
library O
before O
Edward S-PERSON
regained O
voice O
, O
and O
his O
first S-ORDINAL
word O
, O
or O
rather O
action O
, O
was O
to O
desire O
those O
that O
remained O
to O
stay O
. O
" O
My O
sister O
has O
been O
disgraced O
, O
exposed O

a O
tone O
of O
misery O

determination O

so O
startled O
Miss O

be O
her O
exculpation O

less O

her O
silence O

Aunt B-PERSON

I O
am O
the O
cause O

her O
silence O

I O
was O
the O
tempter O

her O
sin O

deceived O

you O
all O

villain O

has O
saved O
me O
again O

again O
from O
discovery O

disgrace O

for O
her O
sin O

its O
consequences O
would O
have O
saved O
me O
now O

wretch O

For O
a B-TIME
full I-TIME
minute E-TIME
after O

unexpected O
, O
startling O
words O
there O
was O
silence O
, O
for O
none O
could O
speak O
, O
not O
even O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
whose O
first S-ORDINAL
thought O
was O
only O
joy O
, O
that O
Ellen's S-PERSON
silence O
was O
not O
so O
guilty O
as O
it O
seemed O
. O
Edward S-PERSON
had O
crossed O
his O
arms O
on O
the O
reading O

buried O
his O
face O

them O

The O
instantaneous O
change O
of O
sentiment O

his O
confession O
excited O
toward O
Ellen S-PERSON

those O
most O
prejudiced O

now O

could O

she O
felt O
far O
more O
pity O

him O

anger O

looked O
toward O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O

still O
remained O
kneeling O
, O
though O
Ellis S-PERSON
stood O
close O
by O
her O
, O
evidently O
trying O
to O
rouse O
her O
, O

with O
a O
step O
far O
more O

more O

said O

as O
she O
tried O
to O
remove O
the O
hands O
which O
clasped O
the O
burning O
forehead O
, O
as O
if O

alone O

" O
Ellen S-PERSON
unclasped O
her O
hands O
from O
her O
forehead O
, O
and O
looked O
up O
in O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
face O
. O
Her O
lips O
moved O
as O
if O
to O
speak O
, O
but O
in O
a O
moment O
an O
expression O
of O
agony O
flitted O
over O
her O
face O
, O
a O
cry O
broke O
from O
her O
of O
such O
fearful O
physical O
pain O
, O
that O
it O
thrilled O
through O
the O
hearts O
of O
all O
who O
heard O
, O
and O
consciousness O
deserted O
her O
at O
the O

moment O

CHAPTER O
IX O
. O
ILLNESS O
AND O
REMORSE O
. O
It O
was O
indeed O
a O
fearful O
night O
which O
followed O
the O
close O
of O
our O
last O
chapter O
. O
Illness O
, O
sufficient O
to O
occasion O
anxiety O
, O
both O
in O
Herbert S-PERSON
and O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
had O
been O
often O
an O
inmate O
of O
Oakwood S-GPE
, O
but O
it O
had O
merely O
called O
for O
care O
, O
and O
all O
those O
kindly O
sympathies O
, O
which O
render O
indisposition O
sometimes O
an O
actual O
blessing O
, O
both O
to O
those O
who O
suffer O
and O
those O
who O
tend O
. O
But O
illness O
, O
appearing O
to O
be O
but O
the O
ghastly O
vehicle O
of O
death O
, O
clothed O
in O
such O
fearful O
pain O
that O
no O
control O
, O
even O
of O
reason O
and O
strong O
will O
, O
can O
check O
its O
agonized O
expression O
, O
till O
at O
last O
, O
reason O
itself O
succumbs O
beneath O
it O
, O
and O
bears O
the O
mind O
from O
the O
tortured O
frame O
, O
this O
is O
a O
trial O
of O
no O
ordinary O
suffering O
, O
even O
when O
such O
illness O
has O
been O
brought O
about O
by O
what O
may O
be O
termed O
natural O
causes O
. O
But O
when O
it O
follows O
, O
nay O
, O
springs O
from O
mental O
anguish O
, O
when O
the O
sad O
watchers O
feel O
that O
it O
might O
have O
been O
averted O
, O
that O
it O
is O
the O
consequence O
of O
mistaken O
treatment O
, O
and O
it O
comes O
to O
the O
young O
, O
to O
whom O
such O
sorrow O
ought O
to O
be O
a O
thing O
unknown O
, O
was O
it O
marvel O
that O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
as O
she O
stood O
by O
Ellen's S-PERSON
bed O
, O
watching O
the O
alternations O
of O
deathlike O
insensibility O
with O
paroxysms O
of O
pain O
, O
which O
nothing O
could O
relieve O
( O
for O
it O
was O
only O
the O
commencement O
of O
brain O
fever O
) O
, O
felt O
as O
if O
she O
had O
indeed O
never O
known O
grief O
or O
anxiety O
before O
. O
She O
had O
looked O
forward O
to O
Edward's S-PERSON
confession O
bringing O
hope O
and O
rest O
to O
all O
| | O
that O
the O
aching O
head O
and O
strained O
nerves O
of O
her O
poor O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
only O
needed O
returning O
love O
, O
and O
the O
quietness O
of O
assured O
forgiveness O
for O
herself O
and O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
for O
health O
and O
happiness O
gradually O
to O
return O
| | O
and O
the O
shock O
of O
such O
sudden O
and O
terrible O
illness O
, O
betraying O
, O
as O
it O
did O
, O
an O
extent O
of O
previous O
mental O
suffering O
, O
which O
she O
had O
not O
conceived O
as O
possible O
in O
one O
so O
young O
, O
almost O
unnerved O
her O
. O
But O
hers O
was O
not O
a O
character O
to O
give O
way O
| | O
the O
anguish O
she O
experienced O
might O
be O
read O
in O
the O
almost O
stern O
quiet O
of O
her O
face O
, O
in O
her O
gentle O
but O
firm O
resistance O
to O
every O
persuasion O
to O
move O
from O
Ellen's S-PERSON
bed O
, O
not O
only O
through O
that O
dreadful O
night O
, O
but O
for O
the B-DATE
week E-DATE
which O
followed O
. O
The O
idea O
of O
death O
was O
absolute O
agony O
| | O
none O
but O
her O
God O
knew O
the O
struggle O
, O
day O
after O
day O
, O
night O
after O
night O
, O
which O
she O
endured O
, O
to O
compel O
her O
rebellious O
spirit O
to O
submission O
to O
His O
will O
, O
whatever O
it O
might O
be O
. O
She O
knew O
earth's O
dearest O
, O
most O
unalloyed O
happiness O
could O
not O
compare O
with O
that O
of O
Heaven O
, O
if O
indeed O
it O
should O
be O
His O
pleasure O
to O
recall O
her O
| | O
but O
the O
thought O
would O
not O
bring O
peace O
. O
She O
had O
no O
reason O
to O
reproach O
herself O
, O
for O
she O
had O
acted O
only O
as O
imperative O
duty O
demanded O
, O
and O
it O
had O
caused O
her O
almost O
as O
much O
misery O
as O
Ellen S-PERSON
. O
But O
yet O
the O
thought O
would O
not O
leave O
her O
, O
that O
her O
harshness O
and O
cruelty O
had O
caused O
all O
the O
suffering O
she O
beheld O
. O
She O
did O
not O
utter O
those O
thoughts O
aloud O
, O
she O
did O
not O
dare O
give O
words O
to O
that O
deep O
wretchedness O
, O
for O
she O
felt O
her O
only O
sustaining O
strength O
was O
in O
her O
God O
. O
The O
only O
one O
who O
would O
have O
read O
her O
heart O
, O
and O
given O
sympathy O
, O
strength O
, O
comfort O
, O
without O
a O
word O
from O
her O
, O
her O
husband O
, O
was O
far O
away O
, O
and O
she O
dared O
not O
sink O
| | O
though O
there O
were O
times O
when O
heart O
and O
frame O
felt O
so O
utterly O
exhausted O
, O
it O
seemed O
at O
if O
she O
must O
. O
Mr. O
Howard's S-PERSON
presence O
had O
been O
an O
inexpressible O
relief O
. O
" O
Go O
to O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
my O
dear O
friend O
, O
" O
she O
had O
said O
, O
as O
he O
lingered O
beside O
the O
bed O
where O
Ellen S-PERSON
had O
been O
laid O
, O
longing O
to O
comfort O
, O
but O
feeling O
at O
such O
a O
moment O
it O
was O
impossible O

" O
he O
wants O
you O
more O
than O

one O
else O

him O

out O
of O
your O
sight O

" O
Not O
understanding O
her O
, O
except O
that O
Edward S-PERSON
must O
be O
naturally O
grieved O
at O
his O
sister's O
illness O
, O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
sought O
him O
, O
and O
found O
him O
still O
in O
the O
library O
, O
almost O
in O
the O
same O
spot O
. O
" O
This O
is O
a O
sad O
welcome O
for O
you O
, O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
kindly O
laying O
his O
hand O
on O
his O
shoulder O
, O
" O
but O
do O
not O

too O

down O

young O

her O
constitution O

good O

over O

it O
was O

thought O
you O
came O
to O

the O
pupil O

so O
loved O

answered O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
raising O
his O
head O
, O
and O
startling O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
, O
both O
by O
his O
tone O
and O
countenance O
. O
" O
You O

he O
continued O
, O
suddenly O
throwing O
himself O
in O
his O
arms O

bursting O
into O
passionate O
tears O

full O
confidence O

time O

agony O

lethargic O

hope O

one S-CARDINAL

Mr. O
Maitland's S-PERSON
argument O

that O
when O
Ellen S-PERSON
recovered O
her O
senses O
( O
which O

assured O
her O

fail O
before O
that O
— O
if O
she O
so O
exhausted O
it O
— O
carried O
more O
weight O
than O
all O
the O
rest O

and O
her O
daughters O
had O
the O
inexpressible O
relief O
of O
finding O
that O
when O
, O
in O
compliance O
with O
their O
tearful O
entreaties O
, O
she O
did O
lie O
down O
, O
she O
slept O
, O
and O
slept O
refreshingly O
, O
for O
nature O
was O
exhausted O

There O
was O
much O
of O
comfort O
in O
those B-DATE
days E-DATE
of O
trial O
, O
which O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
fully O
realized O
, O
when O
Ellen's S-PERSON
convalescence O
permitted O
her O
to O
recall O
it O
, O
though O
at O
the O
time O
it O
seemed O
unnoticed O
. O
That O
Caroline's S-PERSON
strong O
mind O
and O
good O
heart O
should O
urge O
her O
to O
do O
every O
thing O
in O
her O
power O
to O
save O
her O
mother O
trouble O
, O
even O
to O
entreat O
Ellis S-PERSON

Morris S-PERSON
to O
show O
her O
, O
and O
let O
her O
attend O
to O
the O
weekly S-DATE
duties O
with O
them O
, O
and O
accomplish O
them O
so O
earnestly O
and O
well O
, O
that O
both O
these O
faithful O
domestics O
were O
astonished O
and O
delighted O
, O
was O
not O
surprising O

for O
hers O
was O
a O
character O
to O
display O
its O
better O
qualities O
in O
such O
emergencies O
. O
But O
that O
Emmeline S-PERSON
should O
so O
effectually O
rouse O
herself O
from O
the O
overwhelming O
grief O
, O
which O
had O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
assailed O
her O
at O
Ellen's S-PERSON
fearful O
sufferings O
and O
great O
danger O

as O
to O
be O
a O
comfort O
alike O

her O
mother O

Edward S-PERSON

be O
hopeful O

cheerful O
for O
others' O
sakes O
, O
till O
she O
actually O
became O
so O
, O
was O
so O
unexpected O
, O
from O
the O
grief O
she O
had O
indulged O
in O
when O
she O
parted O
from O
her O
father O
, O
that O
it O
did O
surprise O
. O
To O
be O
in O
the O
room O
with O
Ellen S-PERSON
had O
so O
affected O
her O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
, O
that O
she O
became O
pale O
, O
and O
so O
evidently O
terrified O
, O
that O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
half O
desired O
her O
not O
to O
come O
, O
especially O
as O
she O
could O
do O
no O
good O

Mrs. O
Greville S-PERSON

Mary S-PERSON
had O
tried O
to O
prevail O
on O
her O
to O
stay O
with O
them O
, O
but O
she O
would O
not O
hear O
of O
it O
. O
" O
If O
I O
can O
do O
no O
good O
, O
can O
neither O
help O
mamma O
in O
nursing O
Ellen S-PERSON

nor O
do O
as O
Caroline S-PERSON
does O
, O
I O
can O
, O
at O

, O
try O
to O
comfort O
poor O
Edward S-PERSON

and O
I O
will O
not O
leave O
him O

If O
I O
am O
so O

anxiety O

sorrow O
without O
showing O
it O

no O

dear O
Mary S-PERSON

come O

see O
me O
as O
often O

you O

mamma O

Ellen S-PERSON

we O
are O
all O
happy O
again O
! O
" O
And O
she O
did O
devote O
herself O
to O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
and O
so O
successfully O
— O
with O
her O
gentle O
sympathy O
with O
his O
grief O
, O
her O
tender O
feeling O
toward O
his O
faults O
, O
her O
conviction O
of O
her O
father's O
forgiveness O
, O
her O
unassuming O
but O
heart O
- O
breathing O
piety O
, O
which O
, O
without O
one S-CARDINAL
word O
unduly O
introduced O
of O
a O
subject O
so O
holy O
, O
for O
she O
felt O
herself O
much O
too O
lowly O
and O
ignorant O
to O
approach O
it O
— O
yet O
always O
led O
up O
his O
thoughts O
to O
God O
, O
and O
from O
one O
so O
young O
, O
so O
humble O
, O
and O
, O
in O
general O
, O
so O
joyous O
, O
had O
still O
greater O
effect O
in O
confirming O
his O
returning O
religious O
hope O
, O
than O
had O
his O
teachers O
been O
only O
those O
who O
were O
older O

wiser O
than O
himself O
. O
However O
miserable O
he O
might O
be O
before O
she O
came O
, O
he O
looked O
to O
her O
society O
, O
her O
eloquence O
, O
as O
comfort O
and O
hope O

and O
soon O
perceiving O
this O
, O
she O
was O
encouraged O
to O
go O
on O
, O
though O
quite O
astonished O
— O
for O
she O
could O
not O
imagine O
what O
she O
had O
done O
to O
deserve O
such O
commendation O
— O
when O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
, O
one B-DATE
day E-DATE
meeting O
her O
alone O
, O
took O
both O
her O
hands O
in O
his O
, O
and O
with O
even O
unusual O
fervor O
bade O
God O
bless O
her O
! O
— O
for O
young O
, O
lowly O
as O
she O
was O
, O
she O
not O
only O
comforted O
the O
erring O
, O
but O
raised O
and O
strengthened O
the O
penitent's O
trembling O
faith O

hope O
. O
Poor O
Edward S-PERSON
! O
harder O
than O
all O
seemed O
to O
him O
his O
aunt's O
silence O
. O
He O
knew O
his O
sister O
entirely O
engrossed O
her O
— O
ill O
as O
Ellen S-PERSON
was O
, O
it O
could O
not O
be O
otherwise O
| | O
but O
he O
passionately O
longed O
only O
for O
one O
word O
from O
her O
: O
that O
she O
forgave O
him O
the O
misery O
she O
was O
enduring O
. O
Not O
aware O
that O
such O
was O
his O
feeling O
, O
conscious O
herself O
that O
her O
sole O
feeling O
toward O
him O
was O
pity O
, O
not O
anger O
, O
and O
looking O
to O
herself O
alone O
as O
the O
cause O
of O
her O
poor O
child's O
sufferings O
, O
she O
did O
not O
think O
for O
a O
moment O
that O
he O
could O
imagine O
her O
never O
referring O
to O
his O
confession O
originated O
in O
displeasure O
. O
Ten B-DATE
or I-DATE
twelve I-DATE
days E-DATE
had O
so O
passed O
, O
when O
one B-TIME
afternoon E-TIME
, O
completely O
exhausted O
with O
two S-CARDINAL
nights' O
watchfulness O
— O
for O
though O
nurse O
Langford S-PERSON
and O
Fanny S-PERSON
were O
in O
constant O
attendance O
on O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
she O
could O
not O
rest O
if O
she O
heard O
that O
harrowing O
cry O
for O
her O
, O
even O
though O
her O
presence O
brought O
no O
comfort O
— O
she O
went O
to O
lie O
down O
for O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
hours E-TIME
on O
a O
couch O
in O
her O
dressing O
- O
room O
. O
Caroline S-PERSON
had O
taken O
a O
book O
, O
though O
with O
not O
much O
inclination O
to O
read O
, O
to O
sit O
by O
her O
, O
and O
watch O
that O
her O
sleep O
should O
not O
be O
disturbed O
. O
How O
in O
those O
moments O
of O
quiet O
did O
she O
long O
for O
her O
father O
! O
feeling O
intuitively O
how O
much O
heavier O
was O
her O
mother's O
trial O
without O
his O
loved O
support O
. O
He O
had O
been O
written O
to O
by O
them O
all O
since O
Edward's S-PERSON
confession O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
had O
done O
so O
in O
Ellen's S-GPE
room O
, O
only O
to O
beseech O
him O
to O
write O
forgivingly O
, O
forbearingly O
, O
to O
the O
unhappy O
cause O
of O
all O
. O
She O
did O
not O
dare O
breathe O
her O
feelings O
, O
even O
on O
paper O
, O
to O
him O
, O
convinced O
that O
if O
she O
did O
so O
, O
control O
must O
give O
way O
, O
and O
she O
was O
powerless O
at O
once O

but O
her O
husband O
knew O
her O
so O
well O
that O
every O
suppression O
of O
individual O
emotion O
betrayed O
more O
forcibly O
than O
the O
most O
earnest O
words O
, O
all O
she O
was O
enduring O
. O
Caroline S-PERSON
had O
kept O
her O
affectionate O
vigil O
nearly B-TIME
two I-TIME
hours E-TIME
, O
when O
Edward's S-PERSON
voice O
whispered O
, O
" O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
wants O
you O
, O
dear O
Caroline S-PERSON

let O
me O
take O
your O
place O
, O
I O
will O
be O
quite O
as O
watchful O
as O
yourself O

only O
let O
me O
stay O
here O

you O
do O
not O
know O
the O
comfort O
it O
will O
be O

" O
To O
resist O
his O
look O
of O
pleading O
wretchedness O
was O
impossible O
. O
She O
left O
him O
, O
and O
Edward S-PERSON
drawing O
a O
low O
stool O
to O
the O
foot O
of O
the O
couch O
, O
as O
if O
not O
daring O
to O
occupy O
his O
cousin's O
seat O
, O

was O
close O
by O
the O
pillow O

gazed O
on O
the O
mild O
, O
gentle O
features O
of O
his O
aunt O
, O
as O
in O
their O
deep O
repose O
they O
showed O
still O
clearer O
the O
traces O
of O
anxiety O
and O
sorrow O
, O
and O
felt O
more O
keenly O
than O
ever O
the O
full O
amount O
of O
misery O
, O
which O
his O
errors O
and O
their O
fatal O
concealment O
had O
created O
. O
" O
Why O
is O
it O
, O
" O
he O
thought O
, O
" O
that O
man O
can O
not O
bear O
the O
punishment O
of O
his O
faults O
without O
causing O
the O
innocent O
, O
the O
good O

to O
suffer O
also O
? O
" O

his O
heart O
seemed O
to O
answer O
, O
" O
Because O
by O
those O
very O
social O
ties O

the O
strong O
impulses O

love O
for O
one O
another O

be O
preserved O

vice O
again O

yet O
again O

were O
man O
alone O

sufferer O

vice O
would O
be O
stronger O

never O

" O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
woke O
with O
that O
painful O
start O
which O
long O
watchfulness O
always O
occasions O

missing O
Caroline S-PERSON

yet O
feeling O
as O

her O
eyes O

fixed O
themselves O

figure O

touched O
, O
and O
glad O
of O
the O
opportunity O
to O
speak O
to O
him O
alone O
, O
she O
called O
him O
to O
her O
, O
and O
there O
was O
something O
in O
the O
tone O
that O
encouraged O
him O
to O
fling O
himself O
on O
his O
knees O
by O
her O
side O
, O
and O
sob O
like O
an O
infant O
, O
saying O
, O
almost O
inarticulately O
— O

you O

you O

when O
I O
look O
at O
my O
poor O
Ellen S-PERSON

see O
how O
I O
have O
changed O
this O
happy O
home O
into O
sorrow O

gloom O

sin O

mine O

you O

loved O

a O
son O

I O
feel O
you O
can O
not O

such O
fearful O
chastisement O

the O
hand O

God O

how O

you O
first S-ORDINAL

Did O
the O

his O

" O
I O
feel O
now O
the O
cruel O
selfishness O

, O
oh O
, O
aunt O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
it O
was O
fostered O
in O
me O
from O
my O
earliest O
childhood O

grew O
with O
my O
growth O
, O
increased O
with O
my O
years O

received O
strength O

meaning O
from O
my O
poor O
mother's O
utter O
neglect O

her O

too O
indulgent O

all O
my O
poor O

it O

me O
still O
more O

never O

so O
constantly O
refers O
? O
" O
inquired O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
after O
gently O
soothing O
his O
painful O
agitation O
. O
He O
did O
not O
| | O
but O
acknowledged O
that O
from O
the O
time O
they O
had O
become O
inmates O
of O
Oakwood S-GPE
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
had O
constantly O
saved O
him O
from O
punishment O
by O
bearing O
the O
penalty O
of O
his O
faults O
| | O
recalling O
numerous O
incidents O
, O
trifling O
in O
themselves O
, O
but O
which O
had O
always O
perplexed O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
as O
evincing O
such O
strange O
contradictions O
in O
Ellen's S-PERSON
childish O
character O
, O
and O
none O
more O
so O
than O
the O
disobedience O
which O
we O
related O
in O
our O
second S-ORDINAL
part O
, O
and O
which O
Edward's S-PERSON
avowal O
of O
having O
himself O
moved O
the O
flower O
- O
stand O
, O
now O
so O
clearly O
explained O
. O
He O
said O
, O
too O
, O
that O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
had O
thought O
it O
necessary O
, O
for O
Ellen's S-PERSON
perfect O
justification O
, O
to O
examine O
her O
letters O
and O
papers O
, O
but O
that O
all O
his O
appeals O
to O
her O
had O
been O
destroyed O
but O
one S-CARDINAL
— O
his O
last O
fatal O
inclosure O
, O
the O
exact O
contents O
of O
which O
he O
had O
so O
utterly O
forgotten O
, O
written O
, O
as O
they O
were O
, O
in O
a O
moment O
of O
madness O
, O
that O
he O
shuddered O
himself O
as O
he O
read O
it O
. O
He O
placed O
the O
paper O
in O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
hand O
, O
conjuring O
her O
not O
to O
recall O
her O
forgiveness O
when O
she O
read O
it O
| | O
but O
she O
must O
see O
it O
, O
it O
was O
the O
only O
amends O
he O
could O
make O
his O
poor O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
to O
exculpate O
her O
fully O
. O
Was O
it O
any O
wonder O
it O
had O
almost O
driven O
her O
wild O
? O
or O
that O
she O
should O
have O
scarcely O
known O
the O
means O
she O
adopted O
to O
send O
him O
the O
relief O
, O
which O
, O
as O
he O
deserved O
, O
had O
never O
reached O
him O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
read O
the O
letter O
, O
and O
as O
thought O
after O
thought O
rose O
to O
her O
mind O
, O
connecting O
, O
defining O
, O
explaining O
Ellen's S-PERSON
conduct O
from O
her O
fifteenth S-ORDINAL
birthday O
, O
the O
day O
she O
received O
it O
, O
to O
the O
discovery O
of O
her O
sin O
, O
and O
her O
devoted O
silence O
afterward O
, O
trifling O
incidents O
which O
she O
had O
forgotten O
returned O
to O
add O
their O
weight O
of O
evidence O
, O
and O
increase O
almost O
to O
agony O
her O
self O
- O
reproach O
, O
for O
not O
seeing O
the O
whole O
before O
, O
and O
acting O
differently O
. O
She O
remembered O
now O
Ellen's S-PERSON
procrastination O
in O
writing O
to O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
the O
illness O
which O
followed O
, O
and O
could O
well O
understand O
her O
dread O
lest O
the O
finding O
the O
notes O
should O
be O
traced O
to O
that O
day O
, O
and O
so O
throw O
a O
suspicion O
on O
her O
brother O
, O
and O
her O
consequent O
firmness O
in O
refusing O
to O
state O
the O
day O
she O
had O
found O
them O
. O
That O
long O
interview O
was O
one O
of O
inexpressible O
comfort O
to O
Edward S-PERSON

but O
though O
his O
unfeigned O
repentance O
and O
full O
confession O
gave O
his O
aunt O
hope O
for O
him O
, O
it O
did O
but O
increase O
her O
individual O
trial O
, O
as O
she O
returned O
to O
Ellen's S-PERSON
couch O
, O
and O
listened O
to O
wanderings O
only O
too O
painfully O
explained O
by O
the O
tale O
she O
had O
heard O

MISTAKEN O

It O
was O
the B-DATE
seventeenth I-DATE
day E-DATE
of O
Ellen's S-PERSON
illness O
, O
and O
for O
six B-TIME
- I-TIME
and I-TIME
- I-TIME
thirty I-TIME
hours E-TIME
she O
had O
slept O
profoundly O
, O
waking O
only O
at O
very O
long O
intervals O
, O
just O
sufficiently O
to O
swallow O
a O
few O
drops O
of O
port O
wine O
, O
which O
Mr. O
Maitland S-PERSON
had O
ordered O
to O
be O
administered O
if O
she O
woke O
, O
and O
sunk O
to O
sleep O
again O
. O
It O
was O
that O
deep O
, O
still O
, O
almost O
fearful O
repose O
, O
for O
it O
is O
so O
like O
death O
, O
which O
we O
can O
scarcely O
satisfy O
ourselves O
is O
life O
, O
except O
by O
holding O
a O
glass O
at O
intervals O
to O
the O
lips O
, O
to O
trace O
if O
indeed O

breath O

And O
nurse O
Langford S-PERSON
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
and O
Edward S-PERSON
had O
, O
through O
these O
long O
hours O
, O
watched O
and O
scarcely O
stirred O
. O
For O
they O
knew O
that O
on O
her O
waking O
hung O
hope O
or O
misery O
, O
return O
of O
intellect O
, O
or O
its O
confirmed O
suspension O
. O
Mr. O
Maitland S-PERSON
had O
particularly O
wished O
Edward S-PERSON
to O
be O
with O
her O
when O
she O
recovered O
her O
senses O
, O
that O
his O
presence O
might O
seem O
as O
natural O
as O
either O
of O
her O
cousins O
| | O
but O
he O
warned O
him O
that O
the O
least O
display O
of O
agitation O
on O
his O
part O
, O
or O
reference O
to O
the O
past O
, O
in O
her O
exhausted O
state O
, O
might O
be O
fatal O
to O
her O
. O
It O
was O
quite O
the O
evening O
. O
Widow B-PERSON
Langford E-PERSON
had O
lighted O
the O
lamp O
, O
and O
sat O
down O
by O
the O
fire O
, O
scarcely O
able O
to O
breathe O
freely O
, O
from O
the O
intensity O
of O
her O
hope O
that O
Ellen S-PERSON
would O
recover O
. O
And O
if O
such O
were O
her O
feelings O
, O
what O
were O
Edward's S-PERSON
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
? O
The O
former O
was O
kneeling O
on O
the O
right O
of O
the O
bed O
, O
his O
eyes O
alternately O
fixed O
on O
his O
sister O
, O
and O
buried O
in O
the O
coverlid O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
was O
on O
the O
opposite O
side O
, O
close O
to O
Ellen's O
pillow O
, O
the O
curtain O
drawn O
so O
far O
back O
, O
that O
the O
least O
change O
on O
the O
patient's O
countenance O
was O
discernible O
. O
Hour B-TIME
after I-TIME
hour E-TIME
had O
so O
passed O
, O
the O
chimes O
that O
told O
their O
flight O
were O
scarcely O
heard O
by O
those O
anxious O
watchers O
. O
It O
was O
about B-TIME
eight I-TIME
o'clock E-TIME
, O
when O
a O
slight O
movement O
in O
Ellen S-PERSON
made O
her O
aunt's O
heart O
so O
throb O
, O
as O
almost O
to O
deprive O
her O
of O
breath O

her O
eyes O
unclosed O
, O
and O
a O
smile O
, O
such O
as O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
had O
not O
seen O
for O
weeks S-DATE
, O
nay O
, O
months S-DATE
, O
circled O
her O
lips O
. O
" O
Dear O
aunt O
, O
have O
I O
been O
ill O
? O
It O
seems O
such O
a O
long O
, O
long O
time O
since O
I O
have O
seen O
you O
, O
and O
my O
head O
feels O
so O
strange O

so O
light O

this O
room O
, O
it O
is O
my O
own O

know O

I O

have O
been O
very O

very O
ill O

think O
might O
hurt O
you O

Strength O
will O
soon O
return O
now O

then O
your O
head O
will O
be O
quite O
clear O
again O

" O
returned O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
quietly O
and O
caressingly O
, O
though O
she O
so O
trembled O
with O
the O
change O
from O
sickening O
dread O
to O
certain O
hope O
, O
that O
she O
herself O
scarcely O
knew O
how O

spoke O
at O
all O

me O
so O
ill O

can O
not O
remember O
any O
thing O

it O
seems O
as O

been O
very O
unhappy O

that O
— O
that O
you O

very O
unhappy O
, O
as O
we O
were O
all O
, O
for O
Edward S-PERSON
did O
not O
come O
as O
soon O
as O
we O
expected O
him O
, O
and O
the O
storms O
were O
very O
dreadful O
, O
and O
we O
feared O
his O
ship O
might O
have O
been O
wrecked O
, O
or O
cast O
ashore O
, O
somewhere O
very O
far O
off O
, O
where O
we O
could O
not O
hear O
of O
him O
| | O
and O
when O
you O
saw O
him O
, O
and O
knew O
he O
was O
safe O
, O
the O
anxiety O
and O
pain O
you O
had O
undergone O
, O
made O
you O
ill O
| | O
you O
know O
a O
little O
thing O
will O
do O
that O
, O
dearest O
. O
" O
" O
But O
is O
he O
really O
safe O
, O
aunt O
Emmeline S-PERSON
? O
Where O
is O
he O
? O
" O
" O
Close O
by O
you O
, O
love O
. O
He O
has O
been O
as O
watchful O
and O
anxious O
a O
nurse O
as O
I O
have O
been O
. O
Poor O
fellow O
, O
you O
have O
given O
him O
a O
sad O
welcome O
, O
but O
you O
must O
make O
up O
for O
it O
, O
by O
- O
and O
- O
by O
. O
" O
Ellen S-PERSON
looked O
languidly O
, O
yet O
eagerly O
round O
, O
as O
her O
aunt O
spoke O
, O
and O
her O
gaze O
fixed O
itself O
on O
her O
brother O
, O
who O
was O
struggling O
violently O
to O
suppress O
the O
emotion O
which O
, O
at O
the O
sound O
of O
her O
voice O
, O
in O
connected O
words O
, O
nearly O
overpowered O
him O
| | O
and O
still O
more O
so O
, O
when O
Ellen S-PERSON
said O
, O
more O
eagerly O
than O
she O
had O
yet O
spoken O
— O
" O
Dear O
Edward S-PERSON
! O
come O
and O
kiss O
me O
, O
and O
do O
not O
look O
so O
sad O
. O
I O
shall O
soon O
get O
well O
. O
" O
He O
bent O
over O
her O
, O
and O
kissed O
her O
repeatedly O
, O
trying O
in O
vain O
to O
say O
something O
, O
but O
he O
felt O
so O
choked O
, O
he O
could O
not O
| | O
and O
Ellen S-PERSON
held O
his O
hand O
, O
and O
looked O
earnestly O
, O
searchingly O
in O
his O
face O
, O
as O
if O
trying O
painfully O
to O
define O
the O
vague O
thoughts O
and O
memories O
which O
seemed O
all O
connected O
with O
him O
and O
with O
pain O
, O
but O
which O
would O
not O
take O
a O
distinct O
form O
. O
Her O
eye O
wandered O
from O
him O
for O
a O
moment O
to O
nurse O
Langford S-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
come O
to O
the O
foot O
of O
the O
bed O
, O
and O
that O
seemed O
another O
face O
connected O
with O
the O
blank O
past O
, O
and O
then O
it O
fixed O
itself O
again O
on O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
and O
her O
pale O
face O
so O
worked O
with O
the O
effort O
of O
thought O
, O
that O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
became O
alarmed O
. O
She O
saw O
, O
too O
, O
that O
Edward S-PERSON
was O
growing O
paler O
and O
paler O
, O
and O
trembled O
for O
the O
continuance O
of O
his O
control O
. O
Taking O
Ellen's S-PERSON
hand O
gently O
from O
his O
, O
and O
arranging O
her O
pillow O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
so O
as O
to O
turn O
her O
face O
rather O
from O
him O
, O
she O
said O
, O
playfully O
— O
" O
You O
have O
looked O
at O
Edward S-PERSON
long O
enough O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
to O
be O
quite O
sure O
he O
is O
safe O
at O
home O
. O
So O
now O
I O
shall O
be O
jealous O
if O
you O
give O
him O
any O
more O
of O
your O
attention O
and O
neglect O
me O
| | O
you O
must O
take O
some O
nourishment O
, O
and O
try O
to O
go O
to O
sleep O
again O
, O
for O
I O
must O
not O
have O
you O
try O
your O
strength O
too O
much O
. O
" O
" O
If O
I O
could O
but O
remember O
clearly O
, O
" O
answered O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
sadly O
| | O
" O
it O
is O
all O
so O
vague O
— O
so O
dark O
— O
but O
I O
do O
not O
think O
it O
was O
only O
because O
he O
did O
not O
come O
, O
that O
made O
me O
so O
unhappy O
. O
" O
" O
You O
are O
not O
going O
to O
be O
disobedient O
, O
dearest O
, O
" O
replied O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
firmly O
, O
though O
fondly O
, O
as O
she O
hastily O
signed O
to O
Edward S-PERSON
to O
leave O
the O
room O
, O
which O
he O
most O
thankfully O
did O
, O
never O
stopping O
till O
he O
reached O
his O
own O
, O
and O
tried O
to O
thank O
God O
for O
His O
great O
mercy O
, O
but O
could O
only O
sob O
. O
" O
I O
told O
you O
not O
to O
think O
, O
because O
to O
do O
so O
might O
retard O
return O
of O
strength O
, O
and O
indeed O
you O
must O
try O
and O
obey O
me O
| | O
you O
know O
I O
am O
very O
peremptory O
sometimes O
. O
" O
And O
the O
fond O
kiss O
with O
which O
she O
enforced O
the O
command O
seemed O
to O
satisfy O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
whose O
natural O
submissiveness O
, O
combined O
with O
excessive O
physical O
weakness O
, O
caused O
her O
to O
obey O
at O
once O
, O
and O
not O
attempt O
to O
think O
any O
more O
. O
She O
took O
the O
required O
nourishment O
with O
returning O
appetite O
, O
and O
soon O
afterward O
fell O
quietly O
and O
happily O
to O
sleep O
again O
, O
her O
aunt's O
hand O
closely O
clasped O
in O
hers O
. O
From O
that B-DATE
day E-DATE
, O
all O
fear O
of O
disordered O
intellect O
departed O
, O
and O
, O
gradually O
, O
the O
extreme O
exhaustion O
gave O
way O
before O
Mr. O
Maitland's S-PERSON
judicious O
treatment O
. O
Strength O
, O
indeed O
, O
returned O
so O
slowly O
and O
almost O
imperceptibly O
, O
that O
it O
was O
necessary O
to O
count O
improvement O
by O
weeks S-DATE
, O
not O
days O
. O
And O
when O
, O
six B-DATE
weeks E-DATE
after O
her O
first S-ORDINAL
seizure O
, O
she O
was O
thought O
well O
enough O
to O
be O
carried O
to O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
dressing O
- O
room O
, O
and O
laid O
on O
a O
couch O
there O
, O
it O
was O
a O
source O
of O
gratitude O
and O
rejoicing O
to O
all O
. O
But O
Mr. O
Maitland S-PERSON
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
soon O
saw O
, O
with O
intense O
anxiety O
, O
that O
with O
physical O
strength O
, O
memory O
and O
thought O
had O
both O
fully O
returned O
, O
and O
that O
their O
consequence O
was O
a O
depression O
so O
deep O
, O
as O
effectually O
to O
retard O
her O
perfect O
recovery O
. O
She O
seemed O
to O
shrink O
from O
all O
attention O
, O
all O
kindness O
, O
as O
utterly O
undeserved O
, O
even O
from O
her O
cousins O
. O
She O
would O
look O
at O
Edward S-PERSON
for O
half B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour E-TIME
together O
, O
with O
an O
expression O
of O
suffering O
that O
made O
the O
heart O
actually O
ache O
. O
At O
times O
she O
would O
receive O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
caressing O
and O
judicious O
tenderness O
as O
if O
it O
were O
her O
only O
comfort O
, O
at O
others O
, O
shrink O
from O
it O
, O
as O
if O
she O
had O
no O
right O
to O
it O
. O
" O
This O
will O
never O
do O
, O
" O
Mr. O
Maitland S-PERSON
said O
, O
about B-DATE
ten I-DATE
days E-DATE
after O
Ellen's S-PERSON
removal O
into O
her O
daily O
quarters O
, O
and O
finding O
she O
was O
losing O
ground O
| | O
" O
there O
is O
something O
on O
her O
mind O
, O
which O
must O
be O
removed O
, O
even O
if O
to O
do O
so O
, O
you O
refer O
to O
the O
past O
. O
She O
remembers O
it O
all O
too O
clearly O
, O
I O
fear O
, O
so O
our O
not O
alluding O
to O
it O
does O
no O
good O
. O
You O
must O
be O
the O
physician O
in O
this O
case O
, O
my O
dear O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
for O
I O
am O
powerless O
. O
" O
But O
though O
she O
quite O
agreed O
with O
him O
, O
how O
to O
approach O
such O
a O
very O
painful O
subject O
required O
no O
little O
consideration O
| | O
but O
, O
as O
is O
very O
often O
the O
case O
, O
chance O
does O
that O
on O
which O
we O
have O
expended O
so O
much O
thought O
. O
One B-TIME
afternoon E-TIME
Ellen S-PERSON
lay O
so O
still O
, O
so O
pale O
, O
on O
her O
couch O
, O
that O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
bent O
over O
her O
to O
listen O
if O
she O
breathed O
, O
saying O
as O
she O
did O
so O
, O
almost O
unconsciously O
— O
" O
My O
poor O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
when O
shall O
I O
have O
the O
comfort O
of O
seeing O
you O
well O
and O
happy O
again O
? O
" O
Ellen S-PERSON
hastily O
unclosed O
her O
eyes O
, O
for O
she O
was O
not O
asleep O
— O
it O
had O
been O
only O
the O
stupor O
of O
painfully O
- O
engrossing O
thought O
, O
rendering O
her O
insensible O
to O
all O
outward O
things O
, O
but O
her O
aunt's O
voice O
aroused O
her O
, O
and O
it O
seemed O
an O
inexpressible O
relief O
to O
feel O
they O
were O
quite O
alone O
. O
Trying O
to O
rise O
, O
and O
clasping O
her O
hands O
, O
she O
said O
, O
in O
a O
tone O
of O
strong O
excitement O
— O
" O
Oh O
, O
aunt O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
how O
can O
I O
be O
happy O

how O

well O

that O

my O
sin O

the O
misery O
it O
brought O
on O
me O
, O
Edward S-PERSON
might O
be O
safe O
still O
? O
no O
one O
need O
have O
known O
his O
errors O

I O
tried O
to O
save O
— O
and O
— O
and O
I O
have O
only O
betrayed O
, O
and O
made O
him O
wretched O

All O
I O
suffered O
was O
for O
nothing O

worse O
than O
nothing O

" O
Thank O
God O

you O
have O
spoken O

my O
dear O
child O
! O

felt O
as O
if O

not O
introduce O
the O
subject O

now O
that O

yourself O

you O
will O
listen O
to O
me O
patiently O

Ellen S-PERSON

to O
disperse O
the O
painful O
mists O

that O
are O

pressing O
so O
heavily O
on O

poor O
little O
heart O

she O
said O

fondly O

seriously O
, O
as O
she O
put O
her O
arm O
round O
Ellen S-PERSON

to O
support O
her O

up O

Yes O

dearest O

by O
leading O
him O

a O
full O
confession O

giving O
him O
not O
only O
the O
inexpressible O
comfort O
of O
such O
a O
proceeding O

permitting O
him O

that O
great O

disappointing O
as O
his O
errors O
are O
, O

conquered O

They O
are O
not O
of O
the O
irremediable O

guilt O

confirming O
nature O

that O

Harding's S-PERSON

him O
hope O

a O
belief O

not O
fear O
for O
Edward S-PERSON

my O

he O
will O
give O

you O

more O
calmly O
on O
the B-DATE

that O
great O

your O

" O
" O
If O
they O

saved O
him O
from O
a O
continuance O
in O
error O

so O
made O
him O
happy O

could O

no O

avoidance O

you O
could O

for O
a O
moment O

I O
could O
send O
you O
away O

borne O
so O
much O

been O

I O
not O
tell O
you O
that O
the O
term O

entirely O

" O
Ellen S-PERSON
did O
try O
to O
smile O
, O
but O
she O
was O
too O
weak O
to O
bear O
this O
complete O
removal O
of O
a O
double O
burden O
without O
an O
emotion O
that O
seemed O
more O
like O
pain O
than O
joy O
. O
She O
laid O
her O
head O
on O
her O
aunt's O
shoulder O
, O
and O
wept O
without O
restraint O
. O
They O
were O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
tears O
she O
had O
shed O
since O
her O
illness O

Mrs. O

thanked O
God O
for O
them O

She O
did O
not O

to O
check O
them O
, O
but O
the O
few O
words O
she O
did O
speak O
, O
told O
such O
affectionate O
sympathy O
, O
such O
perfect O
comprehension O
of O
that O
young O
heart O
, O
that O
Ellen S-PERSON
felt O
as O
if O
a O
mountain O

lead O
were O
dissolving O
from O
her O

" O
And O
now O
, O
my O
Ellen S-PERSON

inquired O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
nearly B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour E-TIME
afterward O
, O
when O
Ellen S-PERSON
seemed O
so O
relieved O

calmed O

that O

talk O

" O
You O

surprised O

it O

What O
is O
this O
promise O

to O
which O
in O
your O
illness O
you O
so O
constantly O
referred O
, O

which O
, O
I O

Edward's S-PERSON

your O

" O
A O
deep O
flush O
rose O
to O
Ellen's O
transparent O
cheek O
and O
brow O
, O
as O
she O
answered O
, O
falteringly O
— O
" O
Ought O
I O
to O
tell O
you O
, O
dear O
aunt O

You O
do O
not O
know O
how O
often O

how O
very O
often O
I O
have O
longed O

ask O
you O

me O

wrong O

whether O
I O
ought O
to O
break O
it O
? O
And O
yet O
it O
seemed O
so O
sacred O
, O
and O
it O
gave O
poor O
mamma O
such O
comfort O
! O
" O
" O
When O
did O
you O
make O
it O

love O

Its O
import O
I O
need O
not O
ask O
you O
, O
for O
you O
betrayed O
it O
, O
when O
you O
knew O
not O
what O
you O
said O
, O
and O
it O
was O
confirmed O
by O
your O
whole O
conduct O
. O
To O
shield O
Edward S-PERSON
from O
blame O
or O
punishment O
, O
by O
never O
revealing O
his O
faults O

" O
" O
Was O
it O
wrong O

" O
murmured O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
hiding O
her O
conscious O
face O
. O
" O
Wrong O
in O
you O
! O
no O
dearest O

for O
you O
were O
too O
young O
to O
know O
all O
the O
pain O
and O
evil O
it O
was O
likely O
to O
bring O
. O
Tell O
me O
when O
, O
and O
how O
, O
it O
was O
taken O
| | O
and O
I O
think O
I O
can O
prove O
to O
you O
that O
your O
poor O
mother O
would O
have O
recalled O
it O
, O
had O
she O
had O
the O
least O
idea O
of O
the O
solemn O
hold O
it O
had O
taken O
upon O
you O
. O
" O
Thus O
encouraged O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
narrated O
the O
scene O
that O
had O
taken O
place O
in O
widow O
Morgan's S-PERSON
cottage O
just O
before O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
arrived O
| | O
and O
her O
mother's O
fears O
for O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
and O
dread O
of O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
which O
it O
was O
very O
evident O
, O
and O
now O
more O
than O
ever O
, O
had O
extended O
to O
both O
her O
children O
. O
She O
said O
that O
Mr. O
Myrvin's S-PERSON
assurance O
, O
that O
her O
mother O
could O
see O
, O
and O
would O
love O
her O
in O
Heaven O
, O
directly O
following O
the O
promise O
, O
had O
given O
it O
still O
more O
weight O
and O
solemnity O
. O
That O
at O
first O
she O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
very O
easy O
to O
keep O
, O
because O
she O
loved O
Edward S-PERSON
so O
dearly O
| | O
but O
she O
had O
not O
been O
long O
at O
Oakwood S-GPE
before O
it O
made O
her O
very O
unhappy O
, O
from O
its O
constant O
interference O
with O
, O
and O
prevention O
of O
, O
her O
obedience O
and O
duty O
to O
her O
aunt O
| | O
that O
it O
had O
often O
caused O
her O
violent O
head O
aches O
, O
only O
from O
her O
vain O
attempts O
to O
satisfy O
herself O
as O
to O
that O
which O
she O
ought O
to O
do O
. O
When O
Edward S-PERSON
first S-ORDINAL
went O
to O
sea O
, O
and O
all O
seemed O
so O
right O
and O
happy O
with O
him O
, O
of O
course O
she O
became O
happier O
than O
she O
had O
ever O
been O
before O
. O
Then O
came O
his O
difficulties O
, O
and O
her O
conviction O
that O
she O
must O
save O
him O
and O
keep O
his O
secret O
. O
That O
her O
reason O
and O
her O
affection O
often O
urged O
her O
to O
confide O
all O
to O
her O
aunt O
, O
certain O
that O
she O
would O
not O
harshly O
condemn O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
but O
would O
forgive O
and O
help O
him O
far O
more O
effectually O
than O
she O
could O
| | O
but O
she O
dared O
not O
, O
for O
whenever O
she O
thought O
thus O
, O
the O
figure O
of O
her O
mother O
rose O
before O
her O
, O
seeming O
to O
reproach O
and O
threaten O
her O
for O
exposing O
the O
child O
she O
so O
dearly O
loved O
to O
disgrace O
and O
ruin O
| | O
and O
this O
was O
so O
vivid O
— O
so O
constant O
during O
his O
last O
appeal O
, O
that O
she O
thought O
she O
must O
be O
going O
mad O
| | O
that O
nothing O
but O
the O
dread O
of O
not O
being O
firm O
enough O
to O
keep O
Edward's S-PERSON
secret O
, O
had O
withheld O
her O
from O
confessing O
her O
sin O
at O
once O
to O
her O
aunt O
, O
especially O
when O
her O
uncle O
had O
so O
solemnly O
denounced O
it O
as O
theft O
, O
and O
that O
when O
it O
was O
discovered O
it O
seemed O
actual O
relief O
, O
though O
it O
brought O
such O
severe O
punishment O
, O
for O
she O
knew O
no O
suffering O
for O
her O
could O
be O
too O
severe O
. O
The O
tale O
, O
as O
Ellen S-PERSON
told O
it O
, O
was O
brief O
and O
simple O
enough O
, O
and O
that O
there O
was O
any O
merit O
in O
such O
a O
system O
of O
self O
- O
devotion O
never O
seemed O
to O
enter O
her O
mind O
for O
a O
moment O
| | O
but O
to O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
it O
revealed O
such O
an O
amount O
of O
suffering O
and O
trial O
, O
such O
a O
quiet O
, O
systematic O
, O
heroic O
endurance O
, O
that O
she O
unconsciously O
drew O
that O
young O
delicate O
being O
closer O
and O
closer O
to O
her O
, O
as O
if O
her O
love O
should O
protect O
her O
in O
future O
from O
any O
such O
trial O
| | O
and O
from O
what O
had O
it O
all O
sprung O
? O
— O
the O
misery O
of O
years O
, O
at O
a O
period O
when O
life O
should O
be O
so O
joyous O
and O
so O
free O
, O
that O
care O
and O
sorrow O
flee O
it O
as O
purely O
and O
too O
briefly O
happy O
to O
approach O
? O
From O
a O
few O
thoughtless O
words O
, O
from O
a O
thoughtless O
, O
partial O
mother O
, O
whose O
neglect O
and O
dislike O
had O
pronounced O
that O
disposition O
cold O
, O
unloving O
and O
inanimate O
whose O
nature O
was O
so O
fervid O
, O
so O
imaginative O
, O
that O
the O
utmost O
care O
should O
have O
been O
taken O
to O
prevent O
the O
entrance O
of O
a O
single O
thought O
or O
feeling O
too O
precocious O
, O
too O
solemn O
for O
her O
years S-DATE
. O
It O
may O
be O
urged O
, O
and O
with O
truth O
, O
that O
to O
an O
ordinary O
child O
the O
promise O
might O
have O
been O
forgotten O
, O
or O
heedlessly O
laid O
aside O
, O
without O
any O
harm O
accruing O
from O
it O
, O

Mrs. O

looked O
at O

sweet O

up O

the O
earnestness O

her O

protection O
against O
the O
bewildering O

contending O
feelings O

her O

young O
heart O

How O
she O
was O
effectually O
to O
remove O
these O
impressions O
of O
years O
indeed O
she O
knew O
not O

her O
heart O
seemed O
to O
pray O

guidance O

peace O

Ellen's S-PERSON

" O

she O
said O

your O
extreme O
youth O
, O
naturally O
enough O
, O
could O
not O
permit O
you O
to O
distinguish O
, O
whether O
it O
was O
called O
for O
by O
a O
mere O
impulse O

her O
suffer O
pain O

sorrow O

be O
led O
into O
error O
, O
too O

, O

conceal O
Percy's S-PERSON
faults O

prevent O
their O
removal O

, O
by O
the O
infliction O

would O
save O
his O

himself O

it O
seems O
so O
different O

my O
cousins O

are O
all O

different O

: O

was O
so O
handsome O

good O

so O
animated O

I O

always O
fretful O

ill O

they O
said O
so O
often O
naughty O

he O
used O
to O
fondle O
poor O
mamma O
, O
and O
show O
his O
love O
, O
which O
I O
was O
afraid O

I O

love O
her O
so O
very O
much O
( O
the O
tears O

to O
her O
eyes O

I O

not O

much O
better O

was O
, O
just O
as O
I O
always O
feel O
all O
my O
cousins O

it O
was O
no O

him O
so O
much O
the O
best O

I O
ever O
made O
any O
difference O
between O
Edward S-PERSON

you O

" O
asked O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON

conquering O
, O
with O
no O
small O
effort O

the O
emotion O
called O
forth O

simple O
words O

no O

no O
! O

she O
clung O
to O
her O

almost O
painful O
emotion O
. O
" O

you O
are O
so O
good O

so O
kind O

mistaken O
impressions O

I O
love O
you O

father O

qualities O
claiming O
our O
love O
quite O
as O
powerfully O
as O
your O
brother O

You O
must O
not O
imagine O
because O
you O
may O
be O
less O
personally O

mentally O
favored O
, O
that O
you O
are O
inferior O

you O

even O

such O
were O
the O
case O

you O
were O
as O
undeserving O

you O
so O
wrongly O
imagine O
yourself O

my O
duty O

as O
that O
of O
your O

their O
individual O

my O

" O
" O
I O
am O
afraid O
my O
poor O
head O
will O
be O
more O
stupid O
at O
figures O
than O
ever O
, O
" O
replied O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
trying O
to O
smile O
, O
too O
. O
" O
Then O
I O
suppose O
I O
must O
think O
of O
something O
else O
. O
Will O
you O
follow O
Emmeline's S-PERSON
example O
, O
and O
tell O
me O
every O
thing O
, O
however O
foolish O
or O
unfounded O
it O
may O
seem O
, O
that O
comes O
into O
this O
little O
head O
— O
whether O
it O
worries O
or O
pleases O
you O
? O
You O
have O
nothing O
, O
and O
you O
will O
have O
nothing O
ever O
again O
, O
I O
trust O
, O
to O
conceal O
from O
me O
, O
my O
dear O
Ellen S-PERSON

and O
if O
you O
will O
do O
this O
, O
you O
will O
give O
me O
more O
comfort O
individually O
, O
and O
more O
security O
for O
the O
furtherance O
of O
your O
happiness O
, O
as O
far O
as O
my O
love O
can O
promote O
it O
, O
than O
any O
other O
plan O
. O
" O
Her O
playfulness O
had O
given O
place O
to O
renewed O
earnestness O
, O
and O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
as O
if O
in O
the O
very O
thought O
of O
such O
perfect O
confidence O
dwelt O
security O
and O
peace O
, O
so O
long O
unknown O
to O
her O
, O
gave O
the O
required O
assurance O
so O
eagerly O
and O
gratefully O
, O
that O
Mrs. O

was O
satisfied O

happy O

CHAPTER O
XI O
. O
THE O
LOSS O
OF O
THE O
SIREN O
. O
From O
that O
day O
, O
Ellen's S-PERSON
recovery O
, O
though O
a O
sad O
trial O
of O
patience O
both O
to O
the O
young O
invalid O
and O
her O
affectionate O
nurses O
, O
was O
surely O
progressive O
, O
without O
any O
of O
those O
painful O
relapses O
which O
had O
so O
tried O
Mr. O
Maitland's S-PERSON
skill O
before O
. O
She O
no O
longer O
shrunk O
from O
the O
society O
of O
her O
relations O
, O
receiving O
Caroline's S-PERSON
and O
Miss O
Harcourt's S-PERSON
many O
kind O
attentions O
with O
surprise O
indeed O
, O
for O
she O
could O
not O
imagine O
what O
could O
so O
have O
altered O
their O
feelings O
toward O
her O
, O
but O
with O
that O
evident O
gratitude O
and O
pleasure O
, O
which O
encourages O
a O
continuance O
of O
kindness O
. O
Emmeline S-PERSON
was O
always O
kind O
, O
but O
it O
was O
indeed O
happiness O
to O
feel O
she O
might O
talk O
with O
and O
share O
her O
amusements O
, O
as O
in O
former O
days S-DATE
| | O
and O
that O
, O
instead O
of O
thinking O
she O
ought O
not O
to O
receive O
her O
aunt's O
affection O
, O
the O
only O
thing O
she O
asked O
in O
return O
was O
her O
full O
confidence O
. O
The O
inexpressible O
rest O
to O
poor O
Ellen S-PERSON
which O
that O
conversation O
gave O
is O
not O
to O
be O
described O
. O
It O
was O
so O
blessed O
, O
so O
soothing O
, O
that O
it O
seemed O
too O
unnatural O
to O
last O
, O
and O
the O
secret O
dread O
that O
her O
uncle O
would O
not O
feel O
toward O
her O
and O
Edward S-PERSON
as O
her O
aunt O
did O
was O
its O
only O
alloy O
. O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
too O
, O
was O
cheerful O
, O
and O
almost O
happy O
when O
with O
her O
| | O
and O
a O
long O
conversation O
with O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
, O
which O
that O
worthy O
man O
insisted O
upon O
having O
as O
soon O
as O
she O
was O
strong O
enough O
, O
to O
remove O
the O
false O
impressions O
which O
his O
severity O
had O
given O
, O
and O
which O
never O
ceased O
to O
grieve O
and O
reproach O
him O
, O
caused O
his O
almost O
daily O
visits O
to O
be O
anticipated O
by O
her O
with O
as O
much O
gladness O
as O
they O
had O
before O
brought O
dread O
. O
" O
And O
now O
that O
anxiety O
for O
Ellen S-PERSON
is O
at O
end O
, O
I O
must O
have O
you O
take O
more O
care O
of O
yourself O
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
. O
Your O
husband's O
last O
injunctions O
, O
were O
, O
that O
I O
should O
never O
pass O
a O
week O
without O
calling O
once O
or O
twice O
at O
Oakwood S-GPE
to O
know O
how O
all O
was O
going O
on O
, O
and O
what O
would O
he O
say O
to O
me O
if O
he O
could O
see O
you O
now O
? O
" O
" O
He O
little O
thought O
how O
my O
strength O
would O
be O
tried O
, O
my O
good O
friend O
, O
and O
so O
will O
quite O
acquit O
you O
. O
I O
assure O
you O
that O
, O
physically O
, O
I O
am O
perfectly O
well O
" O
— O
( O
the O
worthy O
doctor O
shook O
his O
head O
most O
unbelievingly O
) O
— O
" O
but O
even O
with O
one S-CARDINAL
great O
anxiety O
calmed O
, O
there O
remains O
another O
, O
which O
every O
week O
increases O
. O
It O
is O
more O
than O
double O
the O
usual O
time O
of O
hearing O
from O
my O
husband O
. O
We O
have O
never O
had O
any O
answer O
to O
the O
letters O
detailing O
Ellen's S-PERSON
danger O
and O
Edward's S-PERSON
return O
, O
and O
the O
answers O
have O
been O
due O
a B-DATE
full I-DATE
month E-DATE
. O
" O
" O
But O
the O
weather O
has O
been O
so O
unusually O
tempestuous O
, O
it O
may O
have O
been O
impossible O
for O
the O
Siren O
to O
ply O
to O
and O
fro O
from O
Feroe S-GPE
to O
Scotland S-GPE
, O
as O
Hamilton S-PERSON
wished O
, O
and O
no O
ships O
are O
likely O
to O
touch O
at O
those O
islands O
in O
the O
winter O
. O
I O
really O
think O
you O
need O
not O
be O
anxious O
on O
that O
score O
| | O
none O
but O
Arthur B-PERSON
Hamilton's E-PERSON
head O
could O
have O
contrived O
your O
hearing O
as O
regularly O
from O
such O
an O
outlandish O
place O
as O
you O
have O
done O
. O
No O
news O
is O
good O
news O
, O
depend O
upon O
it O
. O
He O
may O
be O
anxious O
on O
your O
account O
, O
and O
returning O
himself O
. O
" O
" O
God O
forbid O
! O
" O
answered O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
turning O
very O
pale O
| | O
" O
better O
the O
anxiety O
of O
not O
hearing O
from O
him O
than O
the O
thought O
of O
his O
being O
at O
sea O
in O
this O
season O
. O
" O
Oakwood S-ORG
had O
resumed O
its O
regular O
happy O
aspect O
, O
though O
Ellen S-PERSON
was O
still O
up O
- O
stairs O
. O
Morris S-PERSON
and O
Ellis S-PERSON
had O
once O
more O
the O
happiness O
of O
their O
beloved O
mistress's O
superintendence O
, O
and O
proud O
were O
they O
both O
, O
as O
if O
Caroline S-PERSON
had O
been O
their O
own O
child O
, O
to O
show O
all O
she O
had O
done O
, O
and O
so O
unostentatiously O
, O
to O
save O
her O
mother O
trouble O
when O
she O
had O
been O
too O
anxious O
to O
think O
of O
any O
thing O
but O
Ellen S-PERSON
| | O
and O
the O
mother's O
heart O
swelled O
with O
a O
delicious O
feeling O
of O
gratitude O
to O
Him O
who O
, O
if O
in O
making O
her O
so O
acutely O
sensible O
of O
her O
solemn O
responsibility O
had O
deepened O
and O
extended O
anxiety O
, O
had O
yet O
in O
the O
same O
measure O
heightened O
and O
spiritualized O
joy O
. O
The O
fruit O
was O
indeed O
worth O
the O
nurture O
, O
though O
it O
might O
have O
been O
often O
washed O
with O
tears O
. O
Intensely O
anxious O
as O
she O
felt O
herself O
, O
as O
did O
also O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
and O
Mr. O
Maitland S-PERSON
, O
and O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
all O
Arthur B-PERSON
Hamilton's E-PERSON
friends O
, O
she O
yet O
tried O
to O
sustain O
the O
spirits O
of O
her O
children O
, O
for O
the O
young O
men O
had O
evidently O
grown O
anxious O
on O
the O
subject O
too O
. O
It O
was O
not O
unlikely O
that O
the O
seas O
round O
Feroe S-GPE
, O
always O
stormy O
, O
should O
prevent O
any O
ship O
leaving O
the O
island O
, O
and O
the O
young O
people O
eagerly O
grasped O
the O
idea O
: O
so O
painful O
is O
it O
to O
youth O
to O
realize O
a O
cause O
for O
anxiety O
| | O
but O
even O
they O
, O
at O
times O
, O
grew O
unconsciously O
sad O
and O
meditating O
, O
as O
the O
usually O
joyous O
season O
of O
Christmas S-DATE
and O
New B-EVENT
Year E-EVENT
passed O
, O
and O
still O
there O
was O
no O
letter O

Ellen S-PERSON
and O
Edward S-PERSON
both O
in O
secret O
dreaded O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
answer O
to O
the O
latter's O
confession O
| | O
but O
still O
their O
affection O
for O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
was O
too O
powerful O
to O
permit O
any O
thought O
of O
self O
interfering O
with O
the O
wish O
that O
her O
anxiety O
might O
be O
calmed O
. O
In O
January S-DATE
the O
weather O
changed O
| | O
the O
tremendous O
winds O
gave O
place O
to O
an O
almost O
unnatural O
calm O
, O
and O
to O
such O
excessive O
mildness O
and O
closeness O
of O
atmosphere O
, O
that O
it O
affected O
the O
health O
of O
many O
who O
were O
strong O
, O
and O
not O
only O
made O
Ellen S-PERSON
very O
languid O
, O
but O
frequently O
recalled O
those O
dreadful O
headaches O
which O
were O
in O
themselves O
an O
illness O
. O
Business O
called O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
to O
Dartmouth S-GPE
near O
the B-DATE
end I-DATE
of I-DATE
the I-DATE
month E-DATE
, O
and O
he O
prevailed O
on O
Edward S-PERSON
to O
accompany O
him O
, O
for O
whenever O
his O
sister O
was O
more O
than O
usually O
suffering O
his O
gloom O
redoubled O
. O
The B-DATE
first I-DATE
few I-DATE
days E-DATE
were O
so O
fine O
that O
the O
change O
renovated O
him O

Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
declared O
it O
was O
the O
sight O
of O
old O
ocean O
, O
and O
Edward S-PERSON
did O
not O
deny O
it O
| | O
for O
though O
it O
was O
good O
for O
the O
permanence O
of O
his O
repentance O
and O
resolution O
to O
amend O
, O
to O
have O
the O
influence O
of O
his O
home O
sufficiently O
long O
, O
his O
spirit O
inwardly O
chafed O
at O
his O
detention O
, O
and O
yearned O
to O
be O
at O
sea O
again O
, O
and O
giving O
proof O
of O
his O
determination O
to O
become O
indeed O
a O
British S-NORP
sailor O
. O
The B-DATE
third I-DATE
day E-DATE
of O
their O
visit O
, O
the O
lull O
and O
heaviness O
of O
the O
air O
increased O
so O
strangely O
and O
closely O
, O
for O
January S-DATE
, O
as O
to O
seem O
almost O
portentous O
. O
Edward S-PERSON
and O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
lingered O
on O
the O
beach O

the O
well O
- O
practiced O
eye O
of O
the O
former O
tracing O
in O
many O
little O
things O
unseen O
to O
landsmen O
, O
the O
slow O
, O
but O
sure O
approach O
of O
a O
fearful O
storm O
. O
" O
It O
is O
strange O
for O
the O
season O

but O
there O
is O
certainly O
electricity O
in O
the O
air O
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
directing O
Mr. O

attention O
to O
ridges O
of O
white O
- O
fringed O
clouds O
floating O
under O
the O
heavens O
, O
whose O
murky O
hue O
was O
becoming O
denser O
and O
denser O

and O
ever O
and O
anon O
, O
as O
lashed O
by O
some O
as O
yet O
silent O
and O
invisible O
blast O
, O
the O
ocean O
heaved O

foamed O

gave O
sure O
evidence O
of O
approaching O
fury O

" O
there O
will O
be O

I O
fear O

terrible O
storm O

night O

look O
at O
those O
birds O
" O
( O
several O
sea O

gulls O
were O
skimming O
along O
the O
waves O
almost O
bathing O
their O
white O
plumage O
in O
the O
blackened O
waters O
) O
" O
strange O
how O
they O
always O
herald O
tempest O

Emmeline S-PERSON
would O
call O
them O
spirits O

the O
destruction O

" O
" O
It O
is O
approaching O
already O

rejoined O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
, O
as O
a O
long O
hollow O
blast O
moaned O
and O
shivered O
round O
them O

followed O
by O
the O
roar O
of O
a O
mountainous O
wave O
bursting O
on O

beach O

" O
God O
have O
mercy O

its O
fury O
! O
" O
and O
he O
gladly O
turned O
more O
inland O
, O
while O
Edward S-PERSON
remained O
watching O
its O
progress O
with O
an O
almost O
pleasurable O
feeling O
of O
excitement O

only O
wishing O

be O
on O
the O
sea O

to O
enjoy O
it O

As O
the B-DATE

drew O
to O

close O

in O
, O
its O
fury O
became O
appalling O
. O
Blasts O
, O
long O
and O
loud O
as O
the O
reverberation O
of O
artillery O
, O
succeeded O
one S-CARDINAL
another O
with O
awful O
rapidity O
, O
tearing O
up O
huge O
trees O
by O
the O
roots O
, O
and O
tiles O
from O
the O
roofs O
. O
Now O
and O
then O
, O
at O
distant O
intervals O
, O
blue O
lightning O
played O
through O
the O
black O
heavens O
, O
betraying O
that O
thunder O
had O
mingled O
with O
the O
wind O
, O
though O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
distinguish O
the O
one S-CARDINAL
sound O
from O
the O
other O
| | O
and O
as O
the O
gusts O
passed O
onward O
, O
streaks O
of O
white O
and O
spots O
of O
strange O
unnatural O
blue O
gleamed O
through O
the O
gloom O
for O
a O
moment's O
space O
, O
leaving O
deeper O
darkness O
as O
they O
disappeared O
. O
The O
ocean O
, O
lashed O
to O
wildest O
fury O
, O
rolled O
in O
huge O
mountains O
of O
troubled O
waters O
, O
throwing O
up O
showers O
of O
snowy O
foam O
, O
contrasting O
strangely O
with O
the O
darkness O
of O
earth O
and O
heaven O
, O
and O
bursting O
with O
a O
sound O
that O
deadened O
for O
the O
time O
even O
the O
wild O
roar O
of O
the O
blast O
. O
To O
read O
or O
even O
to O
converse O
, O
in O
their O
comfortable O
quarters O
in O
the O
hotel O
, O
which O
overlooked O
the O
sea O
, O
became O
as O
impossible O
to O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
as O
to O
Edward S-PERSON
. O
About B-TIME
eleven I-TIME
o'clock E-TIME
, O
however O
, O
the O
wind O
suddenly O
veered O
and O
lulled O
, O
only O
sending O
forth O
now O
and O
then O
a O
long O
sobbing O
wail O
, O
as O
if O
regretful O
that O
its O
work O
of O
destruction O
was O
even O
checked O
| | O
but O
the O
sea O
raged O
with O
equal O
fury O
, O
presenting O
a O
spectacle O
as O
magnificent O
, O
as O
awful O
, O
and O
giving O
no O
appearance O
of O
a O
calm O
. O
A O
sharp O
report O
sounded O
suddenly O
from O
the O
sea O
— O
whether O
it O
was O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
, O
or O
that O
others O
might O
have O
been O
lost O
in O
the O
tumult O
of O
the O
winds O
and O
waves O
, O
who O
might O
answer O
? O
Another O
, O
and O
another O
, O
at O
such O
rapid O
intervals O
, O
that O
the O
danger O
was O
evidently O
imminent O
, O
and O
Edward S-PERSON
started O
to O
his O
feet O
. O
Again O
— O
and O
he O
could O
bear O
it O
no O
longer O
. O
Hurriedly O
exclaiming O
, O
" O
They O
are O
signals O
of O
distress O
and O
close O
at O
hand O
! O
Something O
must O
be O
done O

no O
sailor O
can O
sit O
still O
, O
and O
see O
sailors O
perish O
! O
" O
he O
rushed O
to O
the O
beach O
, O
closely O
followed O
by O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
resolved O
on O
preventing O
any O
mad O
attempt O
. O
Crowds O
of O
fishermen O
and O
townsmen O
had O
congregated O
on O
the O
beach O
, O
drawn O
by O
that O
fearful O
sound O
, O
which O
, O
by O
the O
light O
from O
the O
guns O
seemed O
scarcely O
half B-QUANTITY
a I-QUANTITY
mile E-QUANTITY
distant O
| | O
and O
yet O
so O
perilous O
was O
the O
present O
appearance O
of O
the O
ocean O
, O
that O
to O
go O
to O
their O
assistance O
seemed O
impossible O
. O
Suddenly O
, O
however O
, O
Edward's S-PERSON
voice O
exclaimed O
, O
with O
the O
glad O
and O
eager O
tone O
of O
perfect O
confidence O
, O
" O
They O
can O
be O
saved O
! O
— O
a O
strong O
boat O
and O
two S-CARDINAL
willing O
rowers O
, O
and O
I O
will O
undertake O
to O
reach O
the O
vessel O
, O
and O
bring O
the O
crew O
safe O
to O
shore O
. O
Who O
among O
you O
, O
" O
he O
continued O
turning O
eagerly O
to O
the O
group O
of O
hardy O
fishermen O
, O
" O
will O
be O
my O
assistants O
in O
this O
act O
of O
common O
humanity O

who O

willing O
hearts O

" O
" O
No O
one O
who O
cares O
for O
his O
life O
! O
" O
was O
the O
sullen O
answer O
from O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
those O
he O
addressed O
, O
and O
the O
rest O
stood O
silent O
, O
eyeing O
, O
half O
disdainfully O
half O
admiringly O
, O
the O
slight O
figure O
of O
the O
young O
sailor O
, O
revealed O
as O
it O
was O
, O
in O
the O
fitful O
light O
of O
the O
many O
torches O
scattered O
by O
the O
various O
groups O
along O
the O
beach O
. O
" O
It O
is O
well O
for O
boys O

can O
not O

heads O

not O

boat O
with O
my O
consent O

my O
life O

answered O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
his O
passion O
rising O
high O
. O
" O

to O
sailors O

a O
boat O

will O
go O
by O
myself O

you O

Lend O
me O

fitted O
for O
such O

sea O

It O
would O
have O
made O
a O
fine O
scene O
for O
a O
painter O
, O
that O
young O

slight O
form O

surrounded O
by O

out O

struggling O
still O
with O
the O
fast O

rising O
waters O

Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
saw O
all O
, O
but O
with O
no O
thought O
of O
the O
picturesque O
, O
his O
mind O
was O
far O

exclaimed O
a O
stalwart O
young O
fisherman O
, O
advancing O
, O

Edward S-PERSON
eagerly O
grasped O
his O
rough O
hand O

conjuring O
him O
to O
get O
his O
boat O
at O
once O

there O
was O
not O
a O
moment O

the O
example O
was O
infectious O
, O

an O
old O
man O
hastily O
stepped O
forward O
, O
declaring O
the O
youngsters O

taught O
him O

do O
it O

" O
Great O
God O

what O
do O

" O
exclaimed O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
as O
his O
younger O
companion O
hastened O
down O
the O
beach O
to O
bring O
his O
boat O
to O
the O
leeward O
of O
the O
cliff O
, O
to O
launch O
it O
more O
securely O
, O
and O
a O
rumor O
ran O
through O
the O
crowds O

whence O
arising O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
discover O

" O

never O
leave O
Feroe S-PERSON

him O

What O
foundation O
is O
there O
for O
this O
rumor O

let O
me O
know O
, O
for O
God's O
sake O

But O
none O
could O
tell O
more O
than O
that O
a O
vessel O
, O
entering O
the O
harbor O
just O
before O

gale O

had O
hailed O
the O
Siren S-PRODUCT

about B-QUANTITY
twenty I-QUANTITY
miles E-QUANTITY
distant O

she O
seemed O
laboring O
heavily O

in O
such O
a O
distressed O
state O
that O
a O
very O
little O
would O

word O
escaped O
Edward's S-PERSON
lips O

grew O
for O
the O

blanched O
as O
marble O

Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
to O
whom O
the O
rumor O

brought O
the O
most O
intense O
agony O

doubt O

truth O

relieve O
him O

at O

side O

grasping O
his O
hand O

stopped O

strong O
emotion O

added O
— O
" O
give O
Ellen S-PERSON

cut O
off O

threw O
himself O

moment O
in O

kissed O
his O
cheek O

darting O
down O

into O
the O
boat O

dancing O

was O
several B-TIME

her O
off O

back O

For O
a O
boat O

all O

miraculous O

His O

leaped O
into O
the O

without O
reply O
, O
and O
, O
sinking O
on O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
benches O
, O
drew O
his O
cloak O
closely O
round O
his O
face O
. O
Peril O
was O
indeed O
still O
around O
him O
, O
but O
compared O
with O
the O
— O
even O
to O
that O
Heaven O

directed O
heart O

terrible O
struggle O

death O

rising O
slowly O

surely O
round O
him O

almost O
within O

his O

his O
beloved O

, O
the O
mere O
hope O

life O
seemed O
almost O
overpowering O
. O
The O
crew O
of O
the O
hapless O
Siren S-PERSON
quickly O
deserted O
her O
. O
Captain O
Harvey S-PERSON
was O
the O
last O
to O
descend O
, O
and O
, O
as O
he O
did O
so O
, O
a O
block O
of O
iron O
, O
loosened O
from O
its O
place O
, O
fell O
cornerwise O
, O
and O
struck O
sharply O
on O
Edward's S-PERSON
forehead O
, O
almost O
stunning O
him O
for O
the O
moment O
, O
as O
he O
watched O
the O
captain's O
descent O

He O
felt O
the O
blood O
slowly O
trickling O
down O
his O
temple O

cheek O

but O
he O
was O
not O
one O
to O
be O
daunted O
by O
pain O
: O
he O
resumed O
his O
station O
at O
the O
helm O
in O
unbroken O
silence O
, O
only O
speaking O
when O
directions O
were O
absolutely O
necessary O
, O
and O
then O
only O
in O
a O
few O
brief O
sailor O
- O
terms O
. O
They O
had O
scarcely O
proceeded O
a O
third S-ORDINAL
of O
their O
way O
, O
when O
the O
waters O
boiled O
and O
foamed O
as O
tossed O
by O
some O
strange O
whirlpool O
, O
and O
it O
required O
all O
Edward's O
address O
and O
skill O
as O
steersman O
to O
prevent O
the O
frail O
boat O
from O
being O
drawn O
into O
the O
vortex O
. O
The O
cause O
was O
soon O
displayed O
, O
and O
every O
heart O
shuddered O
, O
for O
ten B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
later E-TIME
, O
and O
help O
would O
indeed O
have O
been O
in O
vain O
. O
The O
unfortunate O
vessel O
had O
sunk O

been O
swallowed O
up O
in O
those O
rushing O
waters O

the O
suction O
of O
so O
large O
a O
mass O
, O
producing O
for O
a O
brief O
interval O
the O
effect O
of O
a O
whirlpool O
. O
The O
silence O
of O
awe O
and O
of O
intense O
thankfulness O
, O
fell O
on O
the O
heart O
of O
every O
man O
, O
and O
more O
than O
all O
on O
his O
, O
who O
had O
so O
far O
recovered O
his O
first S-ORDINAL
emotion O
as O
to O
gaze O
wonderingly O
and O
admiringly O
on O
the O
boyish O
figure O
at O
the O
helm O
, O
whose O
voice O
was O
utterly O
unknown O
, O
and O
whose O
features O
the O
fitful O
light O
, O
and O
the O
youth's O
steadfast O
gaze O
on O
his O
rowers O
, O
prevented O
his O
tracing O
with O
any O
certainty O
. O
The O
crowds O
had O
increased O
on O
the O
shore O
, O
watching O
with O
intense O
eagerness O
the O
return O
of O
the O
boat O

but O
the O
expectation O
was O
too O
deep O
for O
sound O
, O
silence O
almost O
portentous O
reigned O
. O
A O
huge O
sea O
had O
concealed O
her O
for O
several B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
, O
and O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
, O
who O
during O
these O
two S-CARDINAL
long O
hours O
had O
remained O
spell O
- O
bound O
on O
the O
beach O
, O
groaned O
aloud O
in O
his O
agony O

again O

was O
visible O
, O
driven O
on O
with O
fearful O
velocity O
by O
the O
tide O
, O
nearer O
, O
nearer O
still O

He O
thought O
he O
could O
distinguish O
the O
figure O
of O
his O
friend O
: O
he O
was O
sure O
he O
could O
hear O
the O
voice O
of O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
urging O
, O
commanding O
, O
directing O
a O
landing O
somewhere O
, O
in O
contradiction O
to O
the O
opinion O

They O
were O
within O
a B-QUANTITY
dozen I-QUANTITY
yards E-QUANTITY
of O
the O
shore O
, O
but O
still O
not O
a O
sound O
of O
gratulation O
was O
heard O
. O
Every O
eye O
was O
fixed O
, O
as O
in O
the O
fascination O
of O
terror O
, O
on O
a O
wave O
in O
the O
distance O

increasing O
in O
size O

fury O
as O
it O
rapidly O
approached O

It O
neared O
the O
boat O
— O
it O
stood O
impending O
over O
the O
frail O
thing O
as O
a O
mighty O
avalanche O
of O
waters O
— O
it O
burst O

the O
boat O

seen O
no O

a O
wild O

FOREBODINGS O

The O
whole O
of O
the O
day O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
had O
vainly O
tried O
to O
shake O
off O
a O
most O
unwonted O
gloom O
. O
Convinced O
herself O
that O
it O
was O
greatly O
physical O
, O
from O
the O
unusual O
oppressiveness O
of O
the O
weather O
relaxing O
the O
nerves O
, O
which O
had O
so O
many O
months O
been O
overstrained O
, O
yet O
her O
thoughts O
would O
cling O
to O
Mr. O
Maitland's S-PERSON
words O
, O
that O
her O
husband O
might O
be O
coming O
home O
himself O
| | O
but O
if O
the O
accounts O
of O
Ellen's S-PERSON
danger O
and O
Edward's S-PERSON
confession O
had O
recalled O
him O
, O
he O
ought O
to O
have O
arrived O
full O
two B-DATE
or I-DATE
three I-DATE
weeks E-DATE
previous O
. O
The O
gale O
that O
swept O
round O
her O
— O
the O
awful O
and O
unnatural O
darkness O
— O
the O
remarkable O
phenomena O
, O
at O
that O
season O

which O
inland O
could O
be O
fearfully O
distinguished O
from O
the O
gale O
, O
appalled O
the O
whole O
household O
| | O
and O
therefore O
it O
was O
not O
much O
wonder O
that O
the O
vague O
idea O
of O
her O
husband's O
having O
left O
Feroe S-PERSON
, O
and O
exposure O
to O
such O
a O
tempest O
, O
should O
become O
in O
that O
fearful O
anxiety O
almost O
a O
certainty O
of O
agony O
. O
It O
was O
well O
, O
perhaps O
, O
that O
her O
unselfish O
nature O
had O
an O
object O
to O
draw O
her O
in O
some O
slight O
degree O
out O
of O
herself O
, O
for O
her O
firmness O
, O
her O
trust O
beyond O
the O
accidents O
of O
earth O
, O
all O
seemed O
about O
to O
fail O
her O
, O
and O
make O
her O
for O
the O
time O
being O
most O
wretched O
. O
As O
the O
storm O
and O
closeness O
increased O
, O
so O
did O
Ellen's S-PERSON
feverish O
restlessness O
| | O
her O
nerves O
, O
not O
yet O
fully O
restored O
, O
felt O
strung O
almost O
to O
torture O
with O
every O
flash O
, O
and O
clap O
, O
and O
blast O
. O
She O
tried O
to O
laugh O
at O
her O
own O
folly O
| | O
for O
, O
though O
often O
terrified O
, O
when O
a O
little O
child O
, O
at O
the O
storms O
in O
India S-GPE
, O
those O
of O
England S-GPE
had O
never O
affected O
her O
at O
all O
, O
and O
she O
could O
not O
understand O
why O
she O
should O
feel O
this O
so O
childishly O
. O
But O
argument O
is O
of O
little O
moment O
in O
such O
cases O
| | O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
satisfying O
her O
that O
she O
could O
no O
more O
help O
her O
present O
sensation O
than O
her O
physical O
weakness O
, O
tried O
to O
soothe O
and O
amuse O
her O
, O
and O
in O
so O
doing O
partially O
cheered O
herself O
. O
She O
did O
not O
leave O
her O
till O
past O
midnight O
| | O
and O
then O
desiring O
Mrs. O
Langford S-PERSON
to O
sit O
up O
with O
her O
till O
she O
was O
comfortably O
asleep O
, O
retired O
to O
her O
own O
bed- O
room O
. O
Never O
since O
her O
husband's O
absence O
had O
its O
solitude O
felt O
so O
vast O
— O
so O
heavily O
oppressive O
| | O
thought O
after O
thought O
of O
him O
thronged O
her O
mind O
till O
she O
fairly O
gave O
up O
the O
effort O
to O
struggle O
with O
them O
. O
" O
Will O
his O
voice O
ever O
sound O
here O
again O
, O
his O
heart O
give O
me O
the O
support O
I O
need O
? O
" O
rose O
to O
her O
lips O
, O
as O
she O
gazed O
round O
her O
, O
and O
the O
deep O
stillness O
, O
the O
gloom O
only O
broken O
by O
a O
small O
silver O
lamp O
, O
and O
the O
fitful O
light O
of O
the O
fire O
, O
seemed O
but O
a O
solemn O
answer O
. O
She O
buried O
her O
face O
in O
her O
clasped O
hands O
, O
and O
the O
clock O
struck O
two S-CARDINAL
before O
that O
inward O
conflict O
permitted O
her O
once O
more O
to O
lift O
up O
heart O
and O
brow O
in O
meek O
, O
trusting O
faith O
to O
Him O
who O
still O
watched O
over O
her O
and O
her O
beloved O
ones O
| | O
and O
after O
an O
earnest O
, O
voiceless O
prayer O
, O
she O
drew O
her O
little O
table O
, O
with O
its O
books O
of O
devotion O
, O
to O
the O
fire O
, O
and O
read O
thoughtfully O
, O
prayerfully O
, O
for O
another B-TIME
hour E-TIME
, O
and O
then O
sought O
her O
couch O
. O
But O
she O
could O
not O
sleep O
| | O
the O
wind O
had O
again O
arisen O
, O
and O
fearing O
to O
lie O
awake O
and O
listen O
to O
it O
would O
only O
renew O
her O
unusual O
agitation O
, O
she O
rose O
at O
four S-CARDINAL
, O
dressed O
herself O
, O
and O
throwing O
on O
a O
large O
shawl O
, O
softly O
traversed O
the O
passage O
, O
and O
entered O
her O
niece's O
room O
| | O
finding O
her O
, O
as O
she O
fully O
expected O
, O
as O
wakeful O
and O
restless O
as O
herself O
, O
with O
the O
addition O
of O
an O
intense O
headache O
. O
She O
had O
persuaded O
nurse O
Langford S-PERSON
to O
go O
to O
bed O
, O
but O
the O
pain O
had O
come O
on O
since O
then O
, O
and O
made O
her O
more O
restless O
and O
feverish O
than O
before O
. O
She O
could O
not O
lie O
in O
any O
posture O
to O
get O
ease O
, O
till O
at O
last O
, O
about B-TIME
six I-TIME
o'clock E-TIME
, O
completely O
exhausted O
, O
she O
fell O
asleep O
, O
sitting O
almost O
upright O
in O
her O
aunt's O
arms O
, O
her O
head O
leaning O
against O
her O
, O
as O
she O
stood O
by O
the O
bedside O
. O
Fearing O
to O
disturb O
her O
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
would O
not O
move O
, O
desiring O
the O
morning O
prayers O
to O
be O
said O
without O
her O
, O
and O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
and O
her O
daughters O
not O
to O
wait O
breakfast O
, O
as O
she O
would O
have O
it O
with O
Ellen S-PERSON
when O
she O
awoke O
. O
That O
she O
was O
stiff O
and O
exhausted O
with O
three S-CARDINAL
hours' O
standing O
in O
one S-CARDINAL
position O
, O
she O
did O
not O
heed O
, O
perhaps O
scarcely O
felt O
, O
for O
woman's O
loveliest O
attribute O
, O
that O
of O
a O
tender O

utterly O
unselfish O

was O
hers O
to O
perfection O
. O
But O
she O
did O
not O
refuse O
the O
cup O
of O
chocolate O
Caroline S-PERSON
brought O
her O
herself O
, O
and O
with O
affectionate O
earnestness O
entreated O
her O
to O
take O
. O
" O
You O
look O
so O
fatigued O
and O
so O
pale O
, O
dearest O
mother O
, O
I O
wish O
you O
would O
let O
me O
take O
your O
place O

I O
would O
be O
so O
quiet O
, O
so O
gentle O

Ellen S-PERSON
would O
not O
even O
know O
her O
change O
of O
nurses O

" O
" O
I O
do O
not O
doubt O
your O
care O
, O
love O
, O
but O
I O
fear O
the O
least O
movement O
will O
disturb O
this O
poor O
child O
, O
and O
she O
has O
had O
such O
a O
restless O
night O
, O
I O
want O
her O
to O
sleep O
as O
long O
as O
she O
can O
. O
Your O
thoughtful O
care O
has O
so O
refreshed O
me O
, O
that O
I O
feel O
quite O
strong O
again O
, O
so O
go O
and O
finish O
your O
breakfast O
in O
comfort O
, O
dearest O

" O
Caroline S-PERSON
very O
unwillingly O
obeyed O
, O
and O
about B-TIME
a I-TIME
quarter I-TIME
of I-TIME
an I-TIME
hour E-TIME
afterward O
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
was O
startled O
by O
the O
sound O
of O
a O
carriage O
advancing O
with O
unusual O
velocity O
to O
the O
house O
. O
It O
stopped O
at O
the O
main O
entrance O
, O
and O
she O
had O
scarcely O
time O
to O
wonder O
who O
could O
be O
such O
very O
early O
visitors O
, O
when O
a O
loud O
scream O
, O
in O
the O
voice O
of O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
rung O
in O
her O
ears O
| | O
whether O
of O
joy O
or O
grief O
she O
could O
not O
distinguish O
, O
but O
it O
was O
the O
voice O
of O
her O
child O
, O
and O
the O
already O
tortured O
nerves O
of O
the O
wife O
and O
mother O
could O
not O
bear O
it O
without O
a O
sensation O
of O
terror O
, O
amounting O
to O
absolute O
agony O
. O
She O
laid O
Ellen's S-PERSON
head O
tenderly O
on O
the O
pillow O
, O
watched O
over O
her O
, O
though O
her O
limbs O
so O
trembled O
she O
could O
scarcely O
support O
herself O
, O
saw O
with O
intense O
relief O
that O
the O
movement O
had O
not O
disturbed O
her O
quiet O
sleep O
, O
and O
calling O
Mrs. O
Langford S-PERSON
from O
an O
adjoining O
room O
, O
hastily O
descended O
the O
stairs O
, O
though O
how O
she O
did O
so O
, O
and O
entered O
the O
breakfast O
- O
room O
, O
she O
always O
said O
she O
never O
knew O
. O
Many O
and O
eager O
and O
glad O
voices O
were O
speaking O
at O
once O
| | O
the O
very O
servants O
thronged O
the O
hall O
and O
threshold O
of O
the O
room O
, O
but O
all O
made O
way O
for O
her O
. O
" O
Arthur S-PERSON
! O
— O
my O
husband O
! O
" O
she O
did O
find O
voice O
to O
exclaim O
, O
but O
every O
object O
but O
his O
figure O
reeled O
before O
her O
, O
and O
she O
fainted O
in O
his O
arms O
. O
It O
was O
some O
time O
before O
she O
recovered O
, O
for O
mind O
and O
frame O
had O
been O
too O
long O
overtasked O
| | O
and O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
as O
he O
clasped O
her O
in O
his O
arms O
, O
beseeching O
her O
only O
to O
speak O
to O
him O
, O
and O
gazed O
on O
her O
deathlike O
countenance O
, O
felt O
in O
a O
moment O
that O
great O
as O
his O
anxiety O
had O
been O
for O
her O
, O
he O
had O
not O
imagined O
one B-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
half E-CARDINAL
she O
had O
endured O
. O
His O
voice O
— O
his O
kiss O
— O
seemed O
to O
rouse O
the O
scattered O
senses O
, O
even O
more O
effectually O
than O
Miss O
Harcourt's S-PERSON
anxiously O
proffered O
remedies O
| | O
but O
she O
could O
not O
speak O
, O
she O
only O
looked O
up O
in O
his O
face O
, O
as O
if O
to O
be O
quite O
, O
quite O
sure O
he O
had O
indeed O
returned O
| | O
that O
her O
vague O
fancies O
of O
danger O
, O
even O
if O
they O
had O
foundation O
, O
had O
merged O
in O
the O
most O
blissful O
reality O
, O
that O
she O
was O
no O
longer O
alone O
| | O
and O
leaning O
her O
head O
on O
his O
bosom O
, O
was O
only O
conscious O
of O
a O
thankfulness O
too O
deep O
for O
words O
| | O
a O
repose O
that O
, O
since O
his O
departure O
, O
she O
had O
not O
known O
for O
a B-DATE
single I-DATE
day E-DATE
. O
Neither O
she O
nor O
her O
husband O
could O
believe O
that O
it O
was O
only B-DATE
six I-DATE
months E-DATE
since O
they O
had O
been O
separated O
. O
It O
seemed O
, O
and O
to O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
especially O
, O
as O
if O
she O
must O
have O
lived O
through O
years S-DATE
in O
that O
time O
, O
it O
had O
been O
so O
fraught O
with O
sorrow O
. O
" O
Not O
one S-CARDINAL
word O
, O
my O
own O
dearest O
! O
and O
only O
these O
pallid O
cheeks O
and O
heavy O
eyes O
to O
greet O
me O
. O
Must O
I O
reproach O
you O
directly O
I O
come O
home O
, O
for O
, O
as O
usual O
, O
not O
thinking O
enough O
of O
yourself O
| | O
forgetting O
how O
precious O
is O
that O
self O
to O
so O
many O
, O
your O
husband O
above O
all O
? O
" O
" O
Nay O
, O
papa O
, O
you O
shall O
not O
scold O
mamma O
, O
" O
said O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
eagerly O
, O
as O
her O
mother O
tried O
to O
smile O
and O
speak O
in O
answer O
. O
" O
She O
ought O
to O
scold O
you O
, O
for O
not O
sending O
us O
one S-CARDINAL
line O
to O
prepare O
us O
for O
your O
unexpected O
presence O
, O
and O
frightening O
us O
all O
by O
coming O
so O
suddenly O
upon O
us O
, O
and O
making O
mamma O
faint O
, O
as O
I O
never O
saw O
her O
do O
before O
. O
Indeed O
I O
do O
not O
like O
it O
, O
mother O
darling O
! O
" O
continued O
the O
affectionate O
girl O
, O
kneeling O
down O
by O
her O
mother O
, O
and O
clinging O
to O
her O
, O
adding O
, O
in O
a O
suppressed O
, O
terrified O
voice O
, O
" O
It O
was O
so O
like O
death O
. O
" O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
read O
in O
a O
moment O
that O
Emmeline's S-PERSON
playfulness O
was O
only O
assumed O
to O
hide O
strong O
emotion O
| | O
that O
she O
was O
trying O
very O
hard O
for O
complete O
control O
, O
but O
so O
trembling O
, O
that O
she O
knelt O
down O
, O
literally O
because O
she O
could O
not O
stand O
. O
It O
was O
such O
a O
proof O
of O
her O
endeavor O
to O
profit O
by O
her O
mother's O
gentle O
lessons O
, O
that O
even O
at O
that O
moment O
it O
not O
only O
gave O
her O
the O
sweetest O
gratification O
, O
but O
helped O
her O
to O
rouse O
herself O
. O
" O
Indeed O
, O
I O
think O
you O
are O
perfectly O
right O
, O
Emmy O
, O
" O
she O
said O
, O
quite O
in O
her O
usual O
voice O
, O
as O
she O
pressed O
her O
child O
a O
moment O
to O
her O
, O
and O
kissed O
her O
cheek O
, O
which O
was O
almost O
as O
pale O
as O
her O
own O
. O
" O
I O
will O
not O
submit O
to O
any O
scolding O

answerable O

my O
unusual O
weakness O

will O
be O
lenient O
with O
him O

him O

us O

some O
time O

quickly O

early O

did O
you O
arrive O
, O
dearest O
Arthur S-PERSON

" O
she O
added O
, O
looking O
earnestly O
in O
his O
face O
, O
and O
half O
wondering O
at O
the O
expression O
upon O
it O
, O
it O
seemed O
to O
speak O
so O
many O
things O

" O
surely O
not O
this O
morning O
? O

were O
not O

awful O
storm O

enough O

danger O

infinite O
mercy O

preserved O
me O

you O
all O

the O

my O
preservation O

" O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
hand O
closed O
convulsively O
on O
her O
husband's O

her O
eyes O
riveted O
on O
his O
countenance O
as O
if O
she O
would O
grasp O
his O
whole O
meaning O
at O
once O

little O
did O
she O
guess O
the O
whole O

not O

striving O
for O
composure O

playfulness O

at O
the O
news O

quite O
understanding O
why O

interrupted O
the O
most O
interesting O
subject O

still O
determinately O
hiding O
his O
feelings O

a O
tone O

manner O
of O
jest O

leaving O
his O
wife's O
side O
for O
a O
moment O

drew O
Edward S-PERSON
from O
the O
recess O

the O
window O

all O
this O
time O

Mrs. O

gazed O
at O
him O

was O
deadly O
pale O

with O
every O
appearance O
of O
exhaustion O

a O
most O
disfiguring O
patch O
on O
his O
left O
brow O

him O

you O
took O

your O

motherless O

Oh O

I O
can O
not O
thank O
God O
enough O
for O
permitting O

this O
great O
mercy O
, O
" O
were O
the O
only O
words O
poor O
Edward S-PERSON
could O
speak O
, O
when O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
intensity O
of O
his O
aunt's O
emotion O
was O
in O
some O
degree O
conquered O
, O
and O
she O
could O
look O
in O
his O
young O
face O
, O
though O
her O
eyes O
were O
almost O
blinded O
with O
tears O
, O
and O
putting O
back O
the O
bright O
hair O
which O
the O
rain O
and O
spray O
had O
so O
uncurled O
, O
as O
to O
lay O
heavy O
and O
damp O
upon O
his O
pale O
forehead O
, O
she O
imprinted O
a O
long O
, O
silent O
kiss O
upon O
it O
, O
and O
looking O
alternately O
at O
him O
and O
her O
husband O
, O
seemed O
powerless O
to O
realize O
any O
other O
thought O
. O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
briefly O
, O
but O
most O
eloquently O
, O
narrated O
the O
events O
of O
the O
previous O
night O
, O
dwelling O
only O
sufficiently O
on O
his O
imminent O
peril O
, O
to O
evince O
the O
real O
importance O
of O
Edward's S-PERSON
extraordinary O
exertions O
, O
not O
to O
harrow O
the O
feelings O
of O
his O
listeners O
more O
than O
need O
be O
. O
That O
the O
young O
officer's O
determined O
opposition O
to O
the O
almost O
angrily O
expressed O
opinions O
of O
Captain O
Harvey S-PERSON
and O
old O
Collins S-PERSON
as O
to O
the O
better O
landing O
- O
place O
, O
had O
saved O
them O
from O
the O
effects O
of O
the O
huge O
wave O
, O
which O
had O
burst O
like O
a O
water O
- O
spout O
a O
minute O
after O
they O
had O
all O
leaped O
in O
safety O
on O
shore O
, O
almost O
overwhelming O
the O
projecting O
sand O
to O
which O
Collins S-PERSON
had O
wished O
to O
direct O
the O
boat O
, O
and O
so O
proving O
at O
once O
Edward's O
far O
superior O
nautical O
knowledge O
, O
for O
had O
they O
steered O
there O
, O
the O
frail O
bark O
must O
inevitably O
have O
been O
upset O
, O
and O
its O
crew O
washed O
by O
the O
receding O
torrent O
back O
to O
sea O
. O
Harvey S-PERSON
and O
Collins S-PERSON
acknowledged O
their O
error O
at O
once O
, O
and O
looked O
eagerly O
for O
Edward S-PERSON
to O
say O
so O
to O
him O
, O
but O
he O
had O
vanished O
the O
moment O
they O
had O
achieved O
a O
safe O
landing O
, O
to O
Mr. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
annoyance O
, O
for O
he O
had O
not O
the O
least O
suspicion O
who O
he O
was O
, O
and O
only O
longed O
to O
express O
, O
if O
he O
could O
not O
otherwise O
evince O
his O
gratitude O
, O
Collins S-PERSON
and O
Grey S-PERSON
refusing O
the O
smallest O
credit O
, O
declaring O
that O
if O
it O
had O
not O
been O
for O
this O
young O
stranger O
officer O
, O
of O
whom O
they O
knew O
nothing O
, O
not O
even O
his O
name O
, O
not O
a O
man O
would O
have O
stirred O
| | O
that O
for O
any O
fisherman O
or O
mere O
ordinary O
sailor O
to O
have O
guided O
the O
boat O
to O
and O
from O
the O
sinking O
vessel O
, O
in O
such O
a O
sea O
, O
was O
so O
impossible O
, O
that O
no O
one O
would O
have O
attempted O
it O
| | O
old O
Collins S-PERSON
ending O
, O
with O
the O
superstition O
of O
his O
class O
, O
by O
a O
declaration O
, O
that O
his O
disappearance O
convinced O
his O
already O
more O
than O
suspicion O
, O
that O
it O
was O
some O
good O
angel O
in O
a O
boy's O
likeness O
| | O
for O
Arthur B-PERSON
Hamilton E-PERSON
would O
never O
have O
been O
permitted O
so O
to O
perish O
: O
an O
explanation O
, O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
added O
, O
laughingly O
, O
that O
might O
suit O
his O
Emmy S-WORK_OF_ART
, O
but O
was O
rather O
too O
fanciful O
for O
him O
. O
However O
, O
his O
young O
preserver O
was O
nowhere O
to O
be O
found O
, O
but O
, O
to O
his O
extreme O
astonishment O
, O
and O
no O
little O
relief O
( O
for O
now O
that O
he O
was O
so O
near O
home O
, O
his O
anxiety O
to O
hear O
of O
all O
, O
especially O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
whom O
he O
scarcely O
dared O
hope O
to O
find O
alive O
, O
became O
insupportable O
) O
, O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
suddenly O
stood O
before O
him O
, O
grasping O
both O
his O
hands O
, O
without O
the O
power O
, O
for O
a B-TIME
minute E-TIME
or O
two S-CARDINAL
, O
to O
speak O
. O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
overwhelmed O
him O
with O
questions O
, O
scarcely O
giving O
him O
time O
to O
answer O
one O
before O
he O
asked O
another O
. O
They O
had O
nearly O
reached O
the O
hotel O
, O
when O
Captain O
Harvey's S-PERSON
bluff O
voice O
was O
heard O
exclaiming O
— O
" O
Here O
he O
is O
, O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
| | O
he O
is O
too O
exhausted O
to O
escape O
our O
thanks O
and O
blessings O
now O
. O
What O
could O
the O
youngster O
have O
tried O
to O
hide O
himself O
for O
? O
" O
But O
before O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
could O
make O
any O
rejoinder O
, O
save O
to O
grasp O
the O
young O
man's O
hands O
strongly O
in O
his O
own O
, O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
said O
, O
eagerly O
— O
" O
Oblige O
me O
, O
Captain O
Harvey S-PERSON
| | O
take O
that O
boy O
into O
our O
hotel O
, O
it O
is O
only O
just O
round O
the O
corner O
| | O
make O
him O
take O
off O
his O
dripping O
jacket O
, O
and O
give O
him O
some O
of O
your O
sailor's O
stuff O
. O
He O
is O
not O
quite O
strong O
enough O
for O
his O
exertions O
to O
- O
night O
, O
and O
should O
rest O
at O
once O
. O
" O
Captain O
Harvey S-PERSON
bore O
him O
off O
, O
almost O
carrying O
him O
, O
for O
exertion O
and O
a O
variety O
of O
emotions O
had O
rendered O
him O
faint O
and O
powerless O
. O
" O
Do O
you O
know O
him O
, O
Howard S-PERSON
? O
who O
and O
what O
is O
he O
? O
" O
But O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
did O
not O
, O
perhaps O
could O
not O
reply O
, O
but O
hurried O
his O
friend O
on O
to O
the O
hotel O
| | O
and O
entered O
the O
room O
, O
where O
, O
having O
called O
for O
lights O
, O
and O
all O
the O
ingredients O
of O
grog- O
punch O
, O
which O
he O
vowed O
the O
boy O
should O
have O
instead O
of O
the O
brandy O
and O
water O
he O
had O
called O
for O
, O
they O
found O
Edward S-PERSON
trying O
to O
laugh O
, O
and O
protesting O
against O
all O
coddling O
| | O
he O
was O
perfectly O
well O
, O
and O
he O
would O
not O
go O
to O
bed O
, O
and O
could O
not O
imagine O
what O
right O
Captain O
Harvey S-PERSON
had O
to O
be O
a O
sailor O
, O
if O
he O
thought O
so O
much O
of O
a O
storm O
, O
and O
a O
blow O
, O
and O
a O
wetting O
. O
" O
Nor O
should O
I O
, O
if O
you O
were O
sailor O
- O
rigged O

but O
what O
business O
have O
you O
with O
this O
overgrown O
mast O
of O
a O
figure O
, O
and O
a O
face O
pale O
and O
delicate O
as O
a O
woman's O
? O
" O
And O
so O
like O
his O
dying O
mother O
it O
was O
, O
that O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
stood O
for O
a O
moment O
on O
the O
threshold O
, O
completely O
stupefied O
. O
We O
leave O
our O
readers O
to O
imagine O
the O
rest O

and O
how O
Captain O
Harvey S-PERSON
carried O
the O
seemingly O
marvelous O
news O
that O
the O
brave O
young O
officer O
was O
Mr. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
own O
nephew O
, O
over O
the O
town O
, O

in O
every O
fisherman's O
hut O
, O
in O
a O
miraculously O
short O
space O
of O
time O
. O
We O
may O
as O
well O
state O
here O
at O
once O
, O
to O
save O
farther O
retrospection O
, O
that O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
by O
the O
active O
and O
admirable O
assistance O
of O
Morton S-PERSON
, O
had O
, O
after O
a O
three B-DATE
months' E-DATE
residence O
at O
Feroe S-PERSON
, O
perceived O
that O
he O
might O
return O
to O
England S-GPE
much O
sooner O
than O
he O
had O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
anticipated O

he O
did O
not O

the O
probability O

such O

thing O
to O
his O

perfectly O
certain O
himself O

Morton S-PERSON
never O
ceased O
persuading O
him O
to O
name O
a O
period O
for O
his O
return O
, O
knowing O
the O
comfort O
it O
would O
be O
to O
his O
home O

but O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
could O
not O
bear O
the O
idea O
of O
leaving O
his O
friend O
in O
his O
voluntary O
banishment O
so B-DATE
many I-DATE
months E-DATE
sooner O

had O
reckoned O
on O

When O
, O
however O
, O
the O
letters O
came O
from O
Oakwood S-ORG

detailing O
Edward's S-PERSON

thence O
proceeding O

his O
anxiety O

let O
it O
be O
owned O
, O
his O
extreme O
displeasure O
against O
his O
nephew O
, O
prompted O
his O
return O
at O
once O
. O
Morton S-PERSON
not O
only O
conquered O
every O
objection O
to O
his O
immediate O
departure O
, O

tried O
, O
and O
in O
some O
measure O
succeeded O
, O
to O
soften O
his O
anger O
, O
by O
bringing O
before O
him O
many O
points O
in O
Mr. O

showing O
real O

true O
repentance O

the O

, O
which O
a O
first S-ORDINAL
perusal O
of O
a O
narrative O
of O
error O
had O
naturally O
overlooked O

The O

were O
so O
fearfully O
tempestuous O

a B-DATE
full I-DATE

last O
voyage O

Nothing O

the O
extreme O
urgency O
of O
the O
case O

increased O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
detention O

Siren S-PRODUCT

Wick S-ORG
had O
given O

the O
second S-ORDINAL
, O
though O
dated O
ten B-DATE
days I-DATE
later E-DATE

gave O
the O

hopeless O
account O
of O
Ellen S-PERSON

could O
have O
made O
him O
attempt O
a O
voyage O
home O
in O
such O
weather O

yet O
he O
felt O

rest O

knowing O
intuitively O
the O
misery O
his O
wife O
must O
be O
enduring O

scarcely O
able O
to O
bear O

the O

seemed O
most O
probable O

that O
Ellen S-PERSON

be O
taken O
from O
her O

and O
the O
aggravated O
trial O
it O
would O

The O
voyage O
was O
a O
terrible O
one O

for O
length O

heavy O
gales O

More O

into O
port O

Mr. O

might O
continue O
his O
journey O

their O
only O
safety O

keeping O
out O

westward O

the O
vessel O

such O

The O
calm O

the O
constant O

the O
poor O

I O
really O
hardly O
felt O
it O

this B-TIME

demanded O
Emmeline S-PERSON

high O
spirits O
recalled O

cousin O
hesitated O

a O
flush O
mounted O
to O
his O

will O
never O

with O
startling O
earnestness O

he O
left O

looking O
in O
his O
face O
without O
uttering O
a O
word O

Mr. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
answer O
seemed O
to O
satisfy O
all O
parties O
. O
Ellen S-PERSON
meanwhile O
had O
awoke O
, O
quite O
refreshed O
, O
and O
all O
pain O
gone O

been O
dressed O

conveyed O

her O
daily O
quarters O

morning O

unknown O

the O
joyful O
news O

spreading O

through O
the O
house O
, O
had O
reached O
Mrs. O
Langford's S-PERSON
ears O

made O
her O
very O
happy O

she O
had O
quite O
judgment O
enough O

even O
without O
a O
message O
to O

effect O
from O

mistress O

keep O
it O
from O

carefully O
prepared O

can O
I O
say O
to O
my O
little O
Ellen S-PERSON
for O
deserting O
her O
so O
long O
? O
" O
inquired O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
playfully O
, O
as O
she O
entered O
her O
room O
, O
about B-TIME
twelve I-TIME
o'clock E-TIME
, O
after O
a O
long O
private O
conversation O
with O
her O
husband O

" O

wish O
you O
would O
tell O
me O

had O
been O
lying O
down O

satisfy O
me O
better O

you O

do O
me O
the O
most O
good O

look O
at O
me O

tell O
me O
if O
you O
do O
not O
think O
I O
must O
have O
been O
trying O
some O
equally O
efficacious O
remedy O

" O
Ellen S-PERSON
did O
look O
, O
and O
so O
radiant O
was O
that O
kind O
face O
with O
happiness O
, O
that O
she O
was O
startled O

have O
heard O

her O
voice O
trembling O

your O
smiles O

hopes O
to O
be O
with O
us O
very O

very O
shortly O

you O
will O
not O
wonder O
at O
my O
joy O

" O
Ellen S-PERSON
tried O
to O
sympathize O
in O
it O

but O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
soon O
saw O
that O
her O
perhaps O
near O
dread O
of O
what O
should O
be O
her O
uncle's O
judgment O
on O
her O
brother O
and O
herself O
, O
prevented O
all O
pleasurable O
anticipation O
of O
his O
arrival O
, O
and O
that O
the O
only O
effectual O
way O

Three B-DATE

a O
cheerful O
party O
assembled O
in O
his O

dressing O

room O

, O
in O
its O
elegant O
appurtenances O

they O
were O
, O
of O
a O
most O
refined O

beautiful O
taste O

certainly O
deserved O

higher O
appellation O

boudoir O
, O
Percy S-PERSON
had O
always O
declared O

not O
harmonize O
at O
all O
with O
the O
old O
English S-LANGUAGE
comforts O
of O
Oakwood S-GPE
, O
and O
he O
would O
not O
have O
a O
French S-NORP
word O
to O
designate O
his O
mother's O
room O

Ellen S-PERSON
was O
on O
her O
sofa O
working O

Edward S-PERSON

who O
she O
thought O

only O
returned O
that O
morning O

at O
her O
side O

It O
seemed O

her O
wild O
sallies O

snatches O
of O

repeatedly O
made O
Miss O

look O
up O

Mrs. O

from O

surprised O

" O
Emmeline S-PERSON

exclaimed O
Caroline S-PERSON

at O
length O

you O
are O
making O

yourself O

" O
Why O
can O
you O
not O
say O
it O
was O
moved O
by O
an O
irresistible O
sympathy O

It O
is O
most O
extraordinary O
that O
you O
will O
still O
speak O
plain O

now O

the O
table O

at O
present O

are O
the O
only O
subjects O
under O
consideration O

really O
can O

poetical O

either O

Not O

archly O
replied O
Emmeline S-PERSON

bending O
down O
so O
that O
her O
face O

come O
before O
her O
sister O

was O
a O
very O
pretty O

small O
marble O
figure O

" O
Now O

not O
the O
most O

piece O

Emmeline S-PERSON

thought O

touched O

habituated O

be O
compelled O
to O
do O
that O

is O
right O

— O
rendering O
your O
task O
of O
control O
more O
difficult O

more O
susceptible O
to O
poetry O
, O
and O
what O
you O
term O
inspiration O

than O
ever O
, O
you O
must O
try O

infuse O
a O
little O
of O
Caroline's O
steady O
, O
matter O
- O
of O
- O
fact O
into O
your O
poetry O

almost O
despising O
it O

as O
so O
cold O

not O
look O
so O
very O
sad O

so O
very O
serious O
, O
love O

jump O
at O
the O
conclusion O
that O
I O

cautiously O

fondly O

continued O
Emmeline S-PERSON
playfully O
putting O
back O
Edward's S-PERSON

her O

before O

Ellen's S-PERSON
composure O
was O
so O
fully O
restored O
, O
and O
her O
heavy O
dread O
so O
subsided O
, O
that O
the O
relief O
seemed O
to O
her O
almost O
a O
dream O

Could O
it O
be O
possible O
that O
it O
was O
the O

so O
harsh O

stern O

pitiless O

youthful O

Mr. O

his O

Mr. O

was O
inexpressibly O
shocked O
at O
the O
change O
which O
mental O

bodily O
suffering O
had O
wrought O
in O
his O
niece O

There O
is O
always O
something O
peculiarly O
touching O

appealing O
to O
the O
best O
emotions O

in O
youthful O
sorrow O

suffering O
of O
any O
kind O

her O
trial O
had O
been O
such O

aggravated O
one O
— O
combining O
such O
agonized O
remorse O
, O
for O
an O
act O

which O
the O
harshest O
judgment O
, O
knowing O
all O
points O
of O
the O
case O
, O
could O
scarcely O
pronounce O
as O
other O
than O
involuntary O

with O
the O
most O
heroic O

perfectly O
unconscious O
self O

sacrifice O

not O
only O
terror O
for O
her O
brother's O
fate O
, O
but O
an O
almost O
crushing O
sense O
of O
misery O
for O
his O
faults O
, O
that O
the O
pallid O
face O
, O
and O
frame O
so O
delicately O
fragile O
, O
had O
still O
deeper O
claims O
for O
sympathy O
and O
cherishing O
than O
even O
when O
caused O
by O
ordinary O
illness O

The O
loss O
of O
her O
unusually O
luxuriant O
hair O

except O
the O
soft O
bands O

shaded O
her O
face O
, O
visible O
under O
the O
pretty O
little O
lace O
cap O
, O
made O
her O
look O
much O
younger O
than O
she O
really O
was O
, O
and O
so O
delicately O
transparent O
had O
become O
her O
complexion O
, O
that O
the O
blue O
veins O
were O
clearly O
traceable O
on O
her O
forehead O
, O
and O
throat O
, O
and O
hands O

the O
dark O
, O
soft O
lash O
seemed O
longer O
than O

as O
it O
swept O
the O
pale O
cheek O
, O
the O
brow O
more O
penciled O

eye O

in O
imagination O

from O
her O
friends O
knowing O
all O
she O

in O
reality O

was O
so O
expressive O
of O
such O
deep O
, O
quiet O
feeling O

that O
the O
whole O
countenance O
was O
so O
altered O
and O
so O
improved O
, O
that O
it O
seemed O
as O
if O
the O
heavy O
, O
sallow O
child O
was O
rapidly O
changing O
into O
one O
of O
those O
sweet O

lovable O

attracting O
girls O
, O
who O
, O
without O
any O

beauty O

can O
never O
be O
passed O
unnoticed O

At O
Ellen's S-ORG
request O
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
had O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
she O
was O
strong O
enough O
, O
read O
with O
her O
, O
morning O
and O
evening O
, O
the O
devotional O
exercises O
which O
were O
read O
below O
to O
the O
assembled O
family O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
soon O
perceived O
, O
and O
with O
no O
little O
pain O
, O
that O
Ellen S-PERSON
shrunk O
from O
the O
idea O
of O
being O
well O
enough O
to O
rejoin O
them O
, O
in O
actual O
suffering O
. O
Here O
again O
was O
an O
effect O
of O
that O
same O
vivid O
imagination O
, O
of O
whose O
existence O
, O
until O
the O
late O
events O
, O
in O
one O
so O
quiet O
, O
seemingly O
so O
cold O
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
had O
not O
the O
least O
idea O
of O
. O
Ellen S-PERSON
had O
been O
so O
long O
accustomed O
to O
be O
silent O
as O
to O
her O
feelings O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
carefully O
to O
conceal O
them O
, O
that O
much O
as O
she O
might O
wish O
and O
intend O
to O
be O
unreserved O
, O
her O
aunt O
feared O
it O
would O
cause O
her O
some O
difficulty O
to O
be O
so O
, O
and O
she O
could O
not O
hope O
to O
succeed O
in O
controlling O
imagination O
, O
unless O
she O
were O
. O
That B-TIME
night E-TIME
, O
however O
, O
Ellen's S-PERSON
unreserved O
confidence O
gave O
her O
hope O
. O
When O
the O
devotional O
exercises O
, O
in O
which O
she O
had O
joined O
with O
even O
more O
than O
usual O
earnestness O
and O
fervor O
, O
were O
concluded O
, O
she O
said O
, O
with O
almost O
Emmeline's O
confidence O
, O
as O
she O
laid O
her O
hand O
on O
her O
aunt's O
— O
" O
I O
am O
so O
very O
, O
very O
happy O
to O
- O
night O
, O
dear O
aunt O
, O
that O
I O
am O
afraid O
I O
do O
not O
think O
enough O
of O
what O
is O
past O
. O
I O
did O
so O
dread O
my O
uncle's O
return O
— O
so O
tremble O
at O
what O
his O
sentence O
would O
be O
on O
Edward S-PERSON
and O
myself O
, O
that O
even O
your O
kindness O
would O
not O
remove O
the O
weight O

and O
now O
, O
that O
I O
have O
found O
it O
all O
so O
groundless O
, O
and O
he O
is O
so O
kind O
— O
so O
indulgent O
, O
I O
am O
so O
relieved O
, O
that O
I O
fear O
I O
must O
have O
thought O
more O
of O
his O
anger O
than O
the O
anger O
of O
God O
. O
My O
sin O
remains O
the O
same O
in O
His O
sight O
, O
though O
you O
and O
uncle O
Hamilton S-PERSON
have O
so O
fully O
forgiven O
it O
, O
and O
— O
and O
— O
I O
do O
not O
think O
I O
ought O
to O
feel O
so O
happy O

" O
" O
Indeed O
, O
my O
dear O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
I O
think O
you O
may O
. O
Our O
Heavenly O
Father O
is O
still O
more O
merciful O
than O
man O
, O
as O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
so O
clearly O
proved O
to O
you O
, O
in O
the O
long O
conversation O
you O
had O
with O
him O
. O
We O
know O
, O
by O
His O
Holy O
Word O
, O
that O
all O
he O
asks O
is O
sincere O
repentance O
for O
sin O
, O
and O
a O
firm O
conviction O
that O
in O
Him O
only O
we O
are O
made O
sufficiently O
righteous O
for O
our O
penitence O
to O
be O
accepted O
. O
I O
believe O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
that O
His O
forgiveness O
was O
yours O
, O
long O
before O
I O
could O
give O
you O
mine O
, O
for O
He O
could O
read O
your O
heart O
, O
and O
saw O
the O
reason O
of O
your O
silence O
, O
and O
all O
the O
remorse O
and O
suffering O
, O
which O
, O
from O
the O
appearances O
, O
against O
you O
, O
I O
might O
not O
even O
guess O
| | O
and O
that O
, O
in O
His O
compassionating O
love O
and O
pity O
, O
He O
permitted O
your O
increased O
trial O
| | O
ordaining O
even O
the O
failure O
of O
the O
relief O
to O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
to O
convince O
you O
, O
that O
, O
not O
even O
in O
such O
a O
fearful O
case O
as O
yours O
, O
might O
error O
, O
however O
involuntary O
, O
prosper O
. O
I O
can O
trace O
His O
loving O
providence O
even O
in O
the O
fact O
of O
your O
finding O
one S-CARDINAL
more O
note O
than O
you O
wanted O
, O
that O
discovery O
might O
thence O
come O
, O
which O
, O
without O
such O
a O
seeming O
chance O
, O
was O
, O
humanly O
speaking O
, O
impossible O
. O
He O
has O
shown O
compassion O
and O
love O
for O
you O
and O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
in O
the O
very O
sufferings O
He O
ordained O
. O
So O
do O
not O
check O
your O
returning O
happiness O
, O
fearing O
it O
must O
be O
unacceptable O
to O
Him O
. O
Try O
to O
trace O
all O
things O
, O
either O
of O
joy O
or O
sorrow O
, O
to O
Him O
. O
Associate O
Him O
with O
your O
every O

believe O
me O
, O
my O

your O

both O
draw O

" O
Ellen S-PERSON
listened O
eagerly O
, O
gratefully O

felt O

said O

film O
of O

after O
a O
short O
pause O

said O

to O
pray O
, O
and O
it O
was O
so O
painful O

" O
" O
Such O
inability O
is O
very O
often O
so O
entirely O
physical O
, O
my O
dear O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
that O
we O
must O
not O
think O
too O
much O
about O
it O
. O
Our O
simple O
duty O
is O
to O
persevere O
, O
however O
little O
satisfactory O
our O
devotions O

and O
put O
our O
firm O
trust O
in O
our O
heavenly O
Father O
, O
that O
He O
will O
heal O
us O

permit O
His O
countenance O
so O
to O
shine O
upon O
us O
again O

as O
to O
derive O
comfort O
from O
our O
prayers O

Your O
inability O
before O
your O
illness O
was O
the O
natural O
consequence O
of O
Mr. O
Howard's S-PERSON
severe O
representations O
, O
which O
he O
has O
since O
assured O
me O
, O
he O
never O
would O
have O
used O
, O
if O
he O
could O
have O
had O
the O
least O
idea O
of O
the O
cause O
of O
your O
silence O
. O
You O
, O
my O
poor O
child O
, O
were O
suffering O
too O
much O
, O
from O
a O
complete O
chaos O
of O
conflicting O
feelings O
and O
duties O
, O
to O
be O
able O
to O
realize O
this O
, O
and O
I O
am O
not O
at O
all O
astonished O
, O
that O
when O
you O
most O
yearned O
for O
the O
comfort O
of O
prayer O
and O
trust O
, O
the O
thought O
that O
by O
your O
silence O
you O
were O
failing O
in O
your O
duty O
to O
me O
and O
so O
disobeying O
God O
, O
should O
utterly O
have O
prevented O
it O
. O
Since O
your O
severe O
illness O
the O
inability O
has O
been O
entirely O
physical O
. O
As O
strength O
and O
peace O
return O
, O
you O
will O
regain O
the O
power O
, O
and O
realize O
all O
its O
comfort O
. O
Try O
, O
and O
under O
all O
feelings O
trust O
in O
and O
love O
God O
, O
and O
do O
not O
be O
too O
much O
elated O
, O
when O
you O
can O
think O
seriously O
and O
pray O
joyfully O
, O
nor O
too O
desponding O
when O
both O
fail O
you O
. O
In O
our O
present O
state O
, O
physical O
causes O
alone O
, O
so O
often O
occasion O
these O
differences O
of O
feeling O
in O
hours O
of O
devotion O
, O
that O
if O
we O
thought O
too O
much O
about O
them O
, O
we O
should O
constantly O
think O
wrong O
, O
and O
be O
very O
miserable O
. O
Try O
and O
prove O
your O
desire O
to O
love O
and O
serve O
God O
, O
in O
your O
daily O
conduct O
and O
secret O
thoughts O
, O
my O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
and O
you O
will O
be O
able O
to O
judge O
of O
your O
spiritual O
improvement O
by O
action O
and O
feeling O
, O
far O
more O
truly O
and O
justly O
than O
by O
the O
mood O
in O
which O
you O
pray O
. O
" O
The O
earnestness O
of O
truth O
and O
feeling O
was O
always O
so O
impressed O
on O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
manner O
, O
whenever O
she O
addressed O
her O
youthful O
charge O
, O
that O
her O
simplest O
word O
had O
weight O
. O
Happy O
indeed O
is O
it O
when O
youth O
— O
that O
season O
of O
bewildering O
doubt O
and O
question O
, O
and O
vivid O
, O
often O
mistaken O
fancies O
, O
and O
too O
impetuous O
feeling O

has O
the O
rich O
blessing O
of O
such O
affectionate O
counsels O
, O
such O
a O
friend O
. O
Why O
will O
not O
woman O
rise O
superior O
to O
the O
petty O
employments O
and O
feelings O
too O
often O
alone O
attributed O
to O
her O

and O
endeavor O
to O
fit O
herself O
for O
such O
a O
thrice O
blessed O
mission O

by O
sympathy O
with O
young O
enjoyments O
— O
young O
hopes O
— O
young O
feelings O
, O
so O
attract O
young O
affections O
, O
that O
similar O
counsels O

similar O
experiences O
, O
may O
so O
help O

guide O

that O
the O
restless O
mind O

eager O
heart O
quiesce O
into O
all O
the O
calm O

deep O

forth O

A O
fortnight O
after O
Mr. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
arrival O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
was O
well O
enough O
to O
go O
down O
stairs O
for O
part O
of O
the O
day O
, O
and O
even O
to O
read O
and O
write O
a O
little O
. O
She O
was O
so O
very O
anxious O
to O
recommence O
her O
studies O
, O
which O
for O
many O
months O
had O
been O
so O
painfully O
neglected O
, O
that O
it O
was O
a O
great O
trial O
to O
her O
, O
to O
find O
her O
head O
was O
not O
yet O
strong O
enough O
for O
the O
necessary O
application O
. O
There O
were O
many O
, O
very O
many O
privations O
and O
trials O
, O
attendant O
on O
convalescence O
after O
so O
severe O
an O
illness O
, O
known O
only O
to O
Ellen's S-PERSON
own O
heart O
, O
and O
to O
her O
aunt's O
quick O
sympathy O
| | O
and O
she O
very O
quickly O
learned O
in O
them O
the O
meaning O
of O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
words O
regarding O
religion O
in O
conduct O
and O
feeling O
, O
as O
well O
as O
in O
prayer O
. O
She O
tried O
never O
to O
murmur O
, O
or O
dwell O
on O
the O
wish O
for O
pleasures O
which O
were O
denied O
her O
, O
but O
to O
think O
only O
on O
the O
many O
blessings O
which O
surrounded O
her O
. O
It O
was O
not O
an O
easy O
task O
so O
to O
conquer O
natural O
feeling O
, O
especially O
as O
the O
trial O
and O
its O
conquest O
was O
often O
known O
only O
to O
herself O
| | O
but O
the O
earnest O
wish O
, O
indeed O
, O
to O
become O
holy O
in O
daily O
conduct O
, O
as O
well O
as O
in O
daily O
prayer O
, O
never O
left O
her O
mind O
, O
and O
so O
enabled O
her O
at O
length O
fully O
to O
obtain O
it O
. O
If O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
had O
wanted O
evidence O
of O
her O
husband's O
public O
as O
well O
as O
domestic O
worth O
, O
she O
would O
have O
had O
it O
fully O
now O
. O
His O
danger O
and O
his O
preservation O
once O
known O
, O
letters O
of O
regard O
and O
congratulation O
poured O
upon O
him O
, O
and O
Montrose B-PERSON
Grahame E-PERSON
made O
a O
journey O
down O
to O
Oakwood S-GPE
expressly O
to O
welcome O
back O
, O
and O
express O
his O
individual O
gratitude O
for O
his O
friend's O
safety O
to O
his O
youthful O
preserver O
. O
But O
Edward S-PERSON
so O
shrunk O
from O
praise O
or O
admiration O
, O
that O
his O
uncle O
, O
rejoicing O
at O
the O
feeling O
, O
would O
not O
press O
him O
, O
as O
he O
had O
first S-ORDINAL
intended O
, O
to O
accompany O
him O
to O
Oxford S-GPE
, O
where O
he O
went O
to O
see O
his O
sons O
. O
Percy S-PERSON
rated O
him O
soundly O
in O
a O
letter O
for O
not O
coming O
. O
Herbert S-PERSON
seemed O
, O
as O
if O
he O
could O
only O
think O
of O
his O
father's O
danger O
, O
and O
thank O
God O
for O
his O
safety O
, O
and O
for O
permitting O
Edward S-PERSON
to O
be O
the O
means O
. O
So O
great O
was O
the O
desire O
of O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
to O
re-assemble O
all O
their O
happy O
family O
once O
more O
, O
before O
Edward S-PERSON
left O
them O
, O
that O
the O
young O
men O
made O
an O
exception O
to O
their O
general O
rule O
, O
and O
promised O
to O
spend O
Easter B-DATE
week E-DATE
at O
home O
. O
It O
was O
early O
in O

crimson O

at O
her O
side O

a O
moment O

very O
seldom O

" O
that O
William B-PERSON

did O
not O

but O
Mrs. O

must O
like O
it O

regretted O
very O
much O
that O
her O

all O
scattered O
in O
different O

and O
her O
little O
grandson O

whose O
taste O
pointed O
to O
the O

not O

enough O

go O
out O
with O

only O

William B-PERSON
Grey E-PERSON

Susan B-PERSON

can O
not O
possibly O
see O
much O
of O
each O
other O

without O
falling O
in O
love O

they O
will O
make O
such O
an O
industrious O
, O
pretty O
couple O
, O
and O
papa O
will O
give O
them O
a O
cottage O
to O
themselves O
, O

I O
will O
go O
to O
their O
wedding O
! O
" O
" O
Just O
such O
a O
plan O
as O
I O
should O
expect O
from O
your O
giddy O
brain O
, O
Emmy O
. O
But O
how O
do O
you O
know O
that O
Grey S-PERSON
has O
any O
desire O
for O
a O
wife O
? O
" O
" O
Oh O
, O
because O
Edward S-PERSON
said O
he O
could O
not O
help O
remarking O
, O
even O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
that O
awful O
scene O
, O
how O
mournfully O
he O
said O
he O
would O
bear O
a O
hand O

neither O
mother O

sister O

pipe O
for O
him O

now O
, O
if O
he O
married O
Susan S-PERSON

he O
would O
have O
a O
very O
pretty O
wife O
to O
lament O
him O
. O
" O
" O
Poor O
Susan S-PERSON

I O
fancy O
she O
would O
rather O
not O
become O
his O
wife O
, O
if O
it O
be O
only O
to O
mourn O
for O
him O

a O
novel O

for O
a O

Oh O

you O
know O
that O

mean O
exactly O

only O
that O

somebody O

No O

can O
be O
happy O
without O
that O

" O
" O
Susan S-PERSON
was O
telling O
me O
, O
mamma O

how O
thankful O
she O
is O
to O
you O
, O
for O
finding O
her O

her O
sister O

that O
they O
might O
be O
able O
to O
help O
the O
family O

" O
rejoined O
Caroline S-PERSON
. O
" O
I O
was O
quite O
pleased O
with O
her O
manner O
of O
speaking O
, O

she O
blushed O
so O
prettily O
when O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
praised O
the O
extreme O
neatness O
of O
her O
work O

" O
" O

again O
burst O
forth O
Emmeline S-PERSON

who O
it O
seemed O
could O
not O
be O
quiet O
, O
going O
from O
one O
subject O
to O
another O
with O
the O
same O
eager O
zest O

" O
if O
you O
had O
but O
heard O
the O
old O
dame O
tell O
her O
astonishment O
and O
her O
pride O
, O
when O
she O
saw O
you O
enter O
their O
former O
miserable O
hut O
, O
and O
sitting O
down O
on O
an O
old O
sea O

, O
invite O
her O
to O
tell O

listened O
to O
all O
her O
troubles O

just O
as O

her O
equal O

left O
such O
comfort O

actually O
cried O

she O
spoke O

so O
did O
I O

she O
spoke O
so O

Oh O
, O
mother O

how O
proud O
your O

ought O
to O
be O

Flatterer S-PERSON

playfully O
answered O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
laying O
her O
hand O
caressingly O
on O
her O
child's O
mouth O

knelt O
in O

Believe O
me O

to O
win O
love O

so O
easy O

delightful O
, O
that O
there O
is O
no O
merit O
in O
obtaining O
it O

We O
ought O
only O
to O
be O
thankful O

when O
granted O
such O
a O
station O

such O
influence O

, O
mamma O

a O
great O
deal O

good O

somehow O

other O
they O
are O
not O
beloved O

" O
" O
Because O
, O
perhaps O
, O
in O
their O
earnest O
desire O
to O
accomplish O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
good O
, O
they O
may O
not O
think O
quite O
enough O
of O
little O
things O
, O
and O
of O
the O
quick O
sympathy O
with O
other O
persons' O
feelings O
, O
which O
is O
the O
real O
secret O
of O
winning O
love O
, O
and O
without O
which O
, O
sometimes O
even O
the O
greatest O
benefit O
is O
not O
valued O
as O
it O
ought O

did O
you O
see O
old O
Collins S-PERSON
himself O

" O
He O
came O
in O
just O

delighted O

conspiracy O

shall O
scold O

being O
so O
mysterious O

it O

off O

enabling O

spend O

with O

Alice S-PERSON

kept O
a O

Percy S-PERSON

reveling O
in O

idea O

a O
dispute O

arisen O
who O

stay O
with O

upon O

was O
his O
right O

, O
so O
they O
thought O

agreed O

would O
prevail O

Ellen S-PERSON
, O
fancying O
herself O
alone O
with O
him O

not O
seeing O
Herbert S-PERSON

was O
reading O

him O
more O

it O
does O
myself O

low O

after O
Ellen's S-PERSON
early O
dinner O
, O
which O
Herbert S-PERSON
shared O
with O
her O
as O
lunch O
, O
she O
proposed O

what O
she O
knew O
he O
would O
like O
, O
that O
her O
drive O
should O

Greville B-FAC

they O
might O
spend O
a B-TIME
full I-TIME
hour E-TIME
with O
their O
friends O
, O
and O
yet O
be O
back O
in O
time O
. O
Herbert S-PERSON
assented O
gladly O

and O
the O
warm O
welcome O
they O
received O
, O
Mrs. O
Greville's S-PERSON
kind O
care O
of O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
and O
Mary's S-PERSON
eager O
chat O
with O
her O
and O
Herbert S-PERSON
, O
and O
the O
number O
of O
things O
they O
seemed O
to O
find O
to O
talk O
about O
, O
made O
the O
hour O
literally O
fly O

but O
Herbert S-PERSON
, O
enjoyable O
as O
it O
was O
, O
did O
not O
forget O
his O
charge O
, O
and O
drove O
her O
back O
to O
Oakwood S-GPE
while O
the O
sun O
still O
shone O
bright O
and O
warmly O
: O
and O
when O
the O
party O
returned O
, O
which O
they O
did O
only O
just O
in O
time O
to O
dress O
for O
dinner O
, O
and O
in O
the O
wildest O
spirits O
, O
the O
balance O
of O
pleasure O
at O
home O
and O
abroad O
, O
would O
certainly O
have O
been O
found O
quite O
equal O
. O
Ellen S-PERSON
still O
continued O
quietly O
to O
lie O
down O
in O
her O
own O
room O
while O
the O
family O
were O
at O
dinner O
, O
for O
she O
was O
then O
sufficiently O
refreshed O
to O
join O
them O
for O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
hours E-TIME
in O
the O
evening O
. O
Percy S-PERSON
and O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
at O
dinner O
that B-DATE
day E-DATE
, O
kept O
up O
such O
a O
fire O
of O
wit O
and O
mirth O
, O
that O
it O
was O
somewhat O
difficult O
for O
any O
one O
else O
to O
edge O
in O
a O
word O
, O
though O
Edward S-PERSON
and O
Caroline S-PERSON
did O
sometimes O
contrive O
to O
bring O
a O
whole O
battery O
against O
themselves O
. O
Just O
as O
the O
dessert O
was O
placed O
on O
the O
table O
, O
however O
, O
sounds O
of O
rural O
music O
in O
the O
distance O
, O
advancing O
nearer O
and O
nearer O
, O
caused O
Percy S-PERSON
to O
pause O
in O
his O
wild O
sallies O
, O
and O
spring O
with O
Edward S-PERSON
to O
the O
window O
, O
and O
their O
exclamations O
soon O
compelled O
all O
the O
party O
to O
follow O
their O
example O
, O
and O
send O
for O
Ellen S-PERSON
to O
see O
the O
unexpected O
sight O
too O
. O
Banners O
and O
pennons O
floated O
in O
the O
sunshine O
, O
and O
the O
greater O
part O
of O
the O
nautical O
inhabitants O
of O
Dartmouth S-GPE
were O
marshaled O
in O
goodly O
array O
beside O
them O
, O
headed O
by O
Captain O
Harvey S-PERSON
and O
his O
crew O
, O
with O
old O
Collins S-PERSON
in O
the O
midst O
of O
them O
| | O
they O
were O
all O
attired O
in O
the O
new O
clothing O
which O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
had O
presented O
to O
them O
| | O
and O
a O
fine O
picture O
Percy S-PERSON
declared O
old O
Collins's S-PERSON
head O
would O
make O
, O
with O
his O
weather O
- O
beaten O
, O
honest O
- O
speaking O
face O
, O
the O
very O
peculiar O
curls O
in O
which O
his O
really O
yellow O
hair O
was O
twisted O
, O
and O
the O
quid O
of O
tobacco O
, O
from O
which O
, O
even O
on O
this O
grand O
occasion O
, O
he O
could O
not O
relieve O
his O
mouth O
and O
cheek O
. O
A O
band O
of O
young O
men O
and O
girls O
surrounded O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
banner O
, O
which O
, O
adorned O
with O
large O
bunches O
of O
primroses O
and O
violets O
up O
the O
staff O
, O
bore O
the O
words O
, O
" O
Hamilton S-PERSON
and O
benevolence O

" O
and O
among O
them O
Emmeline S-PERSON
speedily O
recognized O
William B-PERSON
Grey E-PERSON
and O
Susan B-PERSON
Collins E-PERSON
, O
walking O
side O
by O
side O
, O
she O
looking O
down O
and O
smiling O
, O
and O
he O
so O
earnestly O
talking O
, O
that O
she O
whispered O
to O
her O
mother O
with O
the O
greatest O
glee O
, O
that O
her O
plan O
would O
take O
place O
after O
all O
. O
Then O
came O
a O
band O
of O
sturdy O
fishermen O
, O
chums O
and O
messmates O
of O
Collins S-PERSON
, O
and O
then O
a O
band O
of O
boys O
and O
girls O
, O
from O
all O
Mr. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
own O
village O
schools O
, O
decked O
in O
their O
holiday O
attire O
, O
and O
holding O
in O
their O
hands O
tasteful O
garlands O
of O
all O
the O
spring O
flowers O
they O
could O
muster O
, O
and O
bearing O
two S-CARDINAL
large O
banners O
, O
one O
with O
the O
words O
, O
" O
Fortescue S-PERSON
forever O
! O
All O
hail O
to O
British S-NORP
sailors O
! O
" O
and O
the O
other O
a O
representation O
of O
the O
scene O
on O
the O
beach O
that O
eventful O
night O
, O
and O
the O
sinking O
vessel O
in O
the O
distance O
. O
The O
workmanship O
was O
rude O
indeed O
, O
but O
the O
effect O
so O
strikingly O
descriptive O
, O
that O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
actually O
shuddered O
as O
she O
gazed O
, O
and O
grasped O
, O
almost O
unconsciously O
, O
the O
arm O
of O
her O
nephew O
as O
he O
stood O
by O
her O
, O
as O
if O
the O
magnitude O
of O
the O
danger O
, O
both O
to O
him O
and O
her O
husband O
, O
had O
never O
seemed O
so O
vivid O
before O
. O
The O
windows O
of O
the O
dining O
- O
room O
had O
been O
thrown O
widely O
open O
, O
and O
as O
the O
rustic O
procession O
came O
in O
sight O
of O
those O
to O
whom O
their O
whole O
hearts O
tendered O
homage O
, O
they O
halted O
| | O
the O
music O
ceased O
, O
and O
cheer O
on O
cheer O
resounded O
, O
till O
the O
very O
echoes O
of O
the O
old O
park O
were O
startled O
out O
of O
their O
sleep O
, O
and O
sent O
the O
shout O
back O
again O
. O
Percy S-PERSON
was O
among O
them O
in O
a O
moment O
, O
singling O
out O
old O
Collins S-PERSON
, O
whom O
he O
had O
tried O
repeatedly O
to O
see O
since O
his O
visit O
home O
, O
but O
never O
found O
him O
, O
and O
grasped O
and O
shook O
both O
his O
hands O
with O
the O
full O
vehemence O
of O
his O
character O
, O
pouring O
out O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
words O
that O
chose O
to O
come O
, O
which O
better O
expressed O
his O
grateful O
feelings O
to O
the O
old O
man O
than O
the O
most O
studied O
speech O
. O
William B-PERSON
Grey E-PERSON
had O
already O
received O
substantial O
proofs O
of O
his O
gratitude O
, O
and O
so O
he O
had O
then O
only O
a O
kind O
nod O
, O
and O
a O
joke O
and O
look O
at O
the O
pretty O
, O
blushing O
Susan S-PERSON
, O
which O
said O
a O
vast O
deal O
to O
both O
, O
and O
seemed O
as O
if O
he O
quite O
seconded O
Emmeline's S-PERSON
plan O
. O
Mingling O
joyously O
with O
all O
, O
he O
had O
bluff O
words O
, O
after O
their O
own O
hearts O
, O
for O
the O
men O
, O
smiles O
for O
the O
maidens O
, O
and O
such O
wild O
jokes O
for O
the O
children O
, O
as O
lost O
them O
all O
decorum O
, O
and O
made O
them O
shout O
aloud O
in O
their O
glee O
. O
Herbert S-PERSON
seconded O
him O
quite O
as O
well O
as O
his O
quieter O
nature O
would O
allow O
. O
Edward S-PERSON
had O
hung O
back O
, O
even O
when O
his O
name O
was O
called O
out O
lustily O
, O
as O
if O
he O
could O
not O
bear O
such O
homage O
. O
" O
Join O
them O
, O
my O
boy O
| | O
their O
humble O
pleasure O
will O
not O
be O
half S-CARDINAL
complete O
without O
you O
, O
" O
whispered O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
earnestly O
, O
for O
she O
guessed O
his O
thoughts O
. O
" O
Remember O
only O
at O
this O
moment O
the O
large O
amount O
of O
happiness O
you O
have O
been O
permitted O
to O
call O
forth O
. O
Do O
not O
underrate O
a O
deed O
which O
all O
must O
admire O
, O
because O
of O
some O
sad O
thoughts O
| | O
rather O
resolve O
— O
as O
you O
can O
and O
have O
resolved O
— O
that O
the O
alloy O
shall O
be O
burned O
away O
, O
and O
the O
true O
metal O
alone O
remain O
, O
for O
my O
sake O
, O
to O
whom O
you O
have O
given O
such O
happiness O
, O
dear O
Edward S-PERSON
. O
" O
The O
cloud O
dispersed O
from O
brow O
and O
heart O
in O
a O
moment O
| | O
and O
he O
was O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
them O
, O
glad O
and O
buoyant O
almost O
as O
Percy S-PERSON
| | O
while O
the O
cheer O
which O
greeted O
him O
was O
almost O
overpowering O
to O
his O
sister O
, O
so O
much O
humble O
, O
yet O
earnest O
feeling O
did O
it O
speak O
. O
" O
You O
really O
should O
have O
given O
us O
timely O
notice O
of O
your O
intentions O
, O
my O
good O
friend O
, O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
warmly O
grasping O
Captain O
Harvey's S-PERSON
hand O
. O
" O
At O
least O
we O
might O
have O
provided O
some O
substantial O
refreshment O
after O
your O
long O
march O
, O
as O
I O
fear O
we O
have O
but O
slender O
fare O
to O
offer O
you O
, O
though O
Ellis S-PERSON

Morris S-PERSON
are O
busy O
already O
, O
I O
am O
happy O
to O
see O
. O
" O
And O
urged O
on O
by O
their O
own O
delight O
at O
this O
homage O
both O
to O
their O
master O
and O
his O
young O
preserver O
, O
who O
had O
become O
a O
complete O
idol O
among O
them O
, O
a O
long O
table O
was O
speedily O
laid O
in O
the O
servants' O
hall O
, O
covered O
with O
a O
variety O
of O
cold O
meats O
, O

bread O

cheese O
in O
abundance O
, O
and O
horns O
of O
cider O
sparkling O
brightly O
beside O
each O
trencher O
. O
Fruit O
and O
cakes O
eagerly O
sought O
for O
by O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
were O
by O
her O
distributed O
largely O
to O
the O
children O

who O
remained O
variously O
grouped O
on O
the O
lawn O

their O
glee O
at O
the O
treat O
heightened O
by O
the O
sweet O

gentle O
manner O
of O
its O
bestowal O
. O
Captain O
Harvey S-PERSON

his O
mate O
, O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
entertained O
himself O
, O
introducing O
them O

his O
family O

especially O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
who O
, O
as O
the O
sister O
of O
Edward S-PERSON

found O
herself O
regarded O
with O
an O
interest O
that O
surprised O
her O

Percy S-PERSON
brought O
in O
old O
Collins S-PERSON

Grey S-PERSON

both O
of O
whom O
had O
expressed O
such O
a O
wish O

see O
any O
one O
so O
nearly O
belonging O
to O
the O
brave O
young O

them O
for O
the O
help O
they O
had O
so O
efficiently O
given O
her O
brother O

made O
them O
still O
prouder O

happier O

After O
an B-TIME
hour I-TIME

a I-TIME
half E-TIME
of O
thorough O
enjoyment O
— O
for O
their O
humble O
homage O

in O
the O

marshaled O
itself O

the O

order O

come O

rude O
as O
the O
music O
was O
, O
it O
sounded O
, O
as O
Emmeline S-PERSON
declared O
, O
really O
beautiful O
, O
becoming O
fainter O

fainter O
in O
the O
distance O

quite O
picturesque O
the O
effect O
of O
the O
banners O

pennons O

as O
they O
gleamed O
in O

out O
the O
woody O
windings O
of O
the O
park O
, O
both O
music O

lights O
came O

the O
excitement O

answered O
Emmeline S-PERSON

with O
a O
confusion O

, O
at O

" O

declare O

laughing O

hesitated O

almost O
painfully O

gathering O
courage O
, O
she O
sat O
down O
to O
her O
harp O
, O

, O
without O
any O
notes O
before O
her O
, O
played O
a O
few O
bars O
of O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
those O
sweet O
, O
thrilling O
Irish S-NORP
melodies O
so O
suited O
to O
her O
instrument O

and O
then O
commenced O
her O
song O
, O
the O
sweetness O
of O
her O
voice O
, O
and O
clearness O
of O
articulation O
atoning O
well O
for O
her O
deficiency O
in O
the O
power O
and O
brilliancy O
which O
characterized O
her O
sister O

The O
words O
were O
exceedingly O
simple O
, O

sung O
with O
deep O
feeling O
, O
and O
heart O

leniently O

at O

trembled O
audibly O

seeming O
to O
derive O
courage O

, O
from O

" O
There O

Emmy O

I O
knew O

find O

out O

said O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
triumphantly O
, O
as O
her O
sister's O
face O
was O
again O
concealed O

" O
Emmeline S-PERSON

must O
hide O
my O
diminished O
head O
! O
" O
spouted O
Percy S-PERSON
. O
" O
I O
thought O
at O
least O
I O
might O
retain O
my O
crown O
as O
the O
poet O
of O
the O
family O

to O
be O
rivaled O

it O
is O
unbearable O

" O
" O
But O
we O
must O
all O
thank O
you O
, O
notwithstanding O
, O
Emmy S-WORK_OF_ART
, O
" O
continued O
Herbert S-PERSON
. O
" O
Ah O
, O
but O
I O
have O
very O
little O
to O
do O
with O
it O

the O
arrangement O
of O
the O
words O
to O
the O
air O
, O
and O
the O
accompaniment O
, O
are O
Caroline's O

I O
could O
not O
have O
done O
that O
, O
" O
said O
Emmeline S-PERSON

her O
tears O
changed O
to O
her O
most O
joyous O
smiles O
. O
Percy S-PERSON
and O
his O
father O
turned O
directly O
to O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
the O
former O
with O
a O
Sir O
Charles B-PERSON
Grandison's E-PERSON
bow O
, O
the O
other O
with O
a O
most O
affectionate O
kiss O
| | O
and O
her O
mother O
looked O
at O
her O
with O
such O
an O
expression O
of O
gratified O
pleasure O
, O
that O
she O
could O
not O
help O
acknowledging O
to O
herself O
, O
such O
pure O
enjoyment O
was O
not O
to O
be O
found O
in O
the O
praise O
and O
admiration O
of O
strangers O
. O
" O
Now O
, O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
you O
have O
still O
a O
mystery O
to O
explain O
, O
" O
said O
Edward S-PERSON
. O
" O
Why O
did O
you O
not O
own O
your O
offspring O
, O
instead O
of O
, O
by O
silence O
, O
almost O
denying O
them O
? O
" O
" O
And O
here O
I O
really O
can O
not O
help O
you O
, O
" O
answered O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
| | O
" O
I O
can O
not O
imagine O
why O
my O
Emmy O
should O
conceal O
a O
fact O
that O
could O
only O
give O
pleasure O
to O
us O
all O
. O
" O
" O
I O
think O
I O
know O
, O
" O
said O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
timidly O
| | O
" O
Emmeline S-PERSON
was O
thinking O
of O
all O
you O
said O
about O
controlling O
an O
impulse O
, O
and O
not O
always O
encouraging O
that O
which O
she O
termed O
inspiration O
, O
and O
perhaps O
she O
thought O
you O
did O
not O
quite O
approve O
of O
her O
writing O
, O
and O
so O
wished O
to O
conceal O
it O
. O
" O
" O
How O
could O
you O
guess O
so O
exactly O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
? O
" O
hastily O
answered O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
forgetting O
, O
in O
her O
surprise O
at O
her O
cousin's O
penetration O
, O
that O
she O
betrayed O
herself O
. O
" O
Because O
I O
should O
have O
felt O
the O
same O
, O
" O
said O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
simply O
. O
" O
Then O
I O
must O
have O
explained O
myself O
very O
badly O
, O
my O
dear O
children O
, O
or O
you O
must O
have O
both O
misunderstood O
me O
. O
I O
did O
not O
mean O
you O
to O
neglect O
such O
on O
enjoyment O
as O
poetry O
, O
but O
only O
to O
keep O
it O
in O
its O
proper O
sphere O
, O
and O
not O
allow O
it O
to O
take O
the O
place O
of O
resources O
, O
equally O
intellectual O
, O
but O
which O
have O
and O
may O
still O
cost O
you O
more O
patience O
and O
labor O
. O
Poetry O
is O
a O
dangerous O
gift O
, O
my O
dear O
child O

but O
as O
long O
as O
you O
bring O
it O
to O
the O
common O
treasury O
of O
Home O
, O
and O
regard O
it O
merely O
as O
a O
recreation O
, O
only O
to O
be O
enjoyed O
when O
less O
attractive O
duties O
and O
studies O
are O
completed O

my O
full O
permission O

cultivate O

No O

be O
thrown O
aside O
, O
my O
Emmeline S-PERSON

only O
care O

not O
— O
by O
loving O

pursuing O

abuse O

I O

Percy's S-PERSON

fail O

placed O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
already O
at O
the O
piano O

and O
Edward S-PERSON

Caroline S-PERSON
are O
ready O
for O
their O
waltz O

" O
" O
And O
so O
I O
transform O
one O
Muse O
into O
another O
, O
" O
exclaimed O
Percy S-PERSON
, O
who O
, O
in O
his O
sister's O
absorbed O
attention O
, O
had O
neared O
her O
unobserved O
, O
and O
catching O
her O
round O
the O
waist O
, O
bore O
her O
to O
the O
upper O
end O
of O
the O
room O
, O
and O
a O
minute O
afterward O
she O
was O
enjoying O
her O
waltz O
, O
with O
as O
much O
childish O
glee O
, O
as O
if O
neither O
poetry O
nor O
reflection O
could O
have O
any O
thing O
to O
do O
with O
her O
. O
" O
Why O
is O
poetry O
a O
dangerous O
gift O
, O
dear O
aunt O
? O
" O
inquired O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
listened O
earnestly O
to O
all O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
had O
said O
. O
" O
Because O
, O
my O
love O
, O
it O
is O
very O
apt O
to O
excite O
and O
encourage O
an O
over O
- O
excess O
of O
feeling O

gives O
a O
habit O
of O
seeing O
things O
other O
than O
they O
really O
are O
, O
and O
engenders O
a O
species O
of O
romantic O
enthusiasm O
, O
most O
dangerous O
to O
the O
young O
, O
especially O
of O
our O
sex O
, O
whose O
feelings O
generally O
require O
control O
and O
repression O
, O
even O
when O
not O
joined O
to O
poetry O
. O
To O
a O
well O
- O
regulated O
mind O
and O
temper O
, O
the O
danger O
is O
not O
of O
the O
same O
serious O
kind O
as O
to O
the O
irregulated O
, O
but O
merely O
consists O
in O
the O
powerful O
temptation O
it O
too O
often O
presents O
to O
neglect O
duties O
and O
employments O
of O
more O
consequence O
, O
for O
its O
indulgence O
. O
There O
is O
a O
species O
of O
fascination O
in O
the O
composition O
of O
even O
the O
most O
inferior O
poetry O
, O
which O
urges O
its O
pursuit O
, O
as O
giving O
so O
little O
trouble O
, O
compared O
to O
the O
perseverance O
necessary O
for O
music O
and O
drawing O
, O
and O
such O
a O
vast O
amount O
of O
pleasure O
, O
that O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
withdraw O
from O
it O
. O
This O
is O
still O
more O
strongly O
the O
case O
when O
the O
young O
first S-ORDINAL
become O
conscious O
of O
the O
gift O
, O
as O
Emmeline S-PERSON
is O
now O
. O
As O
she O
gets O
older O
, O
and O
her O
taste O
improves O
, O
she O
will O
not O
be O
satisfied O
with O
her O
efforts O
, O
unless O
they O
are O
very O
superior O
to O
the O
present O
, O
and O
the O
trouble O
she O
will O
take O
in O
correcting O

improving O

will O
remove O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
the O
too O
dangerous O
fascination O
attending O
it O
now O

still O

am O
not O
anxious O

she O
retains O
her O
confidence O
in O
my O
affection O
and O
experience O
, O
and O
will O
so O
control O
the O
enjoyment O
, O
as O
not O
to O
permit O
its O
interference O
with O
her O
other O
more O
serious O
employments O

" O
Ellen S-PERSON
listened O
eagerly O
, O

they O
continued O
conversing O
on O
many O
similar O
topics O
of O
interest O
and O
improvement O
, O
till O
the O
prayer O
bell O
rang O
, O
and O
startled O
her O
into O
the O
recollection O
that O
she O
had O
always O
retired O
nearly B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour E-TIME
before O
, O

so O
had O
avoided O
entering O
the O
library O

which O
she O
still O
quite O
shrunk O
from O

Percy S-PERSON
stopped O
his O
dance O
, O
which O
he O
had O
converted O
from O
a O
waltz O
into O
a O
most O
inspiring O
gallopade O

declared O

Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
closed O
the O
piano O

Herbert S-PERSON
paused O
in O
his O
conversation O
with O
his O
father O

Nothing O
like O
gloom O
ever O
marked O
the O
signal O
for O
the B-TIME
hour E-TIME
of O
devotion O
, O
but O
lighter O
pleasures O
always O
ceased O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes E-TIME
before O
, O
that O
they O
might O
better O
realize O
the O
more O
serious O
thought O
and O
service O

Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
had O
never O
ceased O
to O
regret O
the O
disgrace O
she O
had O
inflicted O
on O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
in O
not O
permitting O
her O
to O
retain O
her O
own O
place O
with O
the O
family O
, O
at O
least O
in O
the O
hours O
of O
devotion O

for O
it O
seemed O
more O
difficult O
to O
remove O
that O
impression O

any O

her O
other O
trials O

her O
niece's O
startled O
look O
with O
one O
of O
the O
sincerest O
affection O

her O
usual O

an O
eager O

respectful O
look O

affectionate O
admiration O

the O

fingers O

yet O
turned O
into O
thankfulness O
and O
praise O
, O
ere O
the O
service O
ceased O
, O
that O
, O
fiery O
as O
the O
ordeal O
had O
been O
, O
she O
could O
still O
recognize O
a O
hand O
of O
love O
, O
and O
bless O
God O
, O
not O
only O
for O
the O
detection O
of O
her O
involuntary O
sin O
, O
but O
for O
every O
pang O
she O
had O
endured O
. O
The B-DATE
next I-DATE
day E-DATE
was O
Sunday S-DATE
, O
bringing O
with O
it O
all O
sorts O
of O
quiet O
, O
sober O
pleasures O
of O
its O
own O
, O
only O
alloyed O
by O
the O
thought O
that O
it O
was O
the O
last O
day O
of O
Percy's S-PERSON
and O
Herbert's S-PERSON
visit O
. O
The B-TIME
following I-TIME
morning E-TIME
they O
started O
for O
Oxford S-ORG
, O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
and O
Edward S-PERSON
intending O
to O
accompany O
them O
part O
of O
the O
way O
, O
and O
then O
to O
proceed O
to O
Ashburton S-GPE
, O
where O
the O
former O
had O
business O
, O
and O
then O
make O
a O
little O
tour O
through O
Plymouth S-GPE
home O
. O
The O
next O
day O
was O
so O
beautifully O
fine O
and O
genial O
, O
that O
Emmeline S-PERSON
declared O
it O
would O
do O
Ellen S-PERSON
the O
greatest O
possible O
good O
to O
go O
with O
her O
a B-QUANTITY
few I-QUANTITY
miles E-QUANTITY
out O
of O
the O
park O
, O
to O
see O
a O
waterfall O
she O
had O
lately O
discovered O
, O
and O
which O
she O
had O
been O
longing O
for O
Ellen S-PERSON
to O
see O
, O
as O
Caroline S-PERSON
would O
not O
admire O
it O
as O
much O
as O
it O
deserved O
. O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
accompanied O
them O
, O
and O
on O
their O
return O
, O
its O
beauties O
were O
described O
to O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
in O
the O
most O
animating O
strain O
| | O
Emmeline S-PERSON
declaring O
the O
air O
was O
more O
deliciously O
fresh O
, O
the O
trees O
more O
green O
, O
the O
sky O
more O
brilliantly O
blue O
, O
than O
they O
had O
ever O
been O
before O
| | O
and O
that O
the O
very O
sound O
of O
the O
water O
, O
as O
it O
dashed O
down O
a O
black O
rock O
, O
and O
threw O
up O
spray O
, O
which O
the O
rays O
of O
the O
sun O
rendered O
so O
beautifully O
iridescent O
, O
as O
to O
seem O
like O
a O
succession O
of O
rainbows O
, O
was O
a O
whole O
volume O
of O
poetry O
in O
itself O
. O
" O
And O
what O
extraordinary O
vision O
do O
you O
think O
that O
silly O
cousin O
of O
mine O
chose O
to O
fancy O
she O
saw O
coming O
down O
the O
Ashburton S-GPE
road O
, O
mamma O
? O
Actually O
the O
apparitions O
of O
papa O
and O
Edward S-PERSON
. O
She O
will O
persist O
in O
the O
fancy O
. O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
and O
I O
could O
only O
see O
two S-CARDINAL
men O
on O
horseback O
, O
at O
too O
great O
a O
distance O
for O
any O
identity O
to O
be O
recognized O
— O
but O
it O
must O
be O
their O
wraiths O
, O
if O
it O
be O
, O
for O
they O
had O
no O
idea O
of O
coming O
home O
to O
- O
day O
. O
" O
" O
I O
am O
sure O
I O
was O
not O
mistaken O
, O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
Ellen S-PERSON
( O
whom O
her O
aunt O
now O
observed O
looked O
agitated O
and O
flushed O
) O
| | O
" O
and O
they O
were O
riding O
so O
fast O
, O
something O
very O
pressing O
must O
have O
recalled O
them O
. O
" O
" O
And O
you O
are O
frightening O
yourself O
at O
shadows O
, O
my O
dear O
! O
but O
indeed O
I O
think O
you O
must O
be O
mistaken O
, O
for O
your O
uncle O
told O
me O
, O
he O
should O
be O
particularly O
engaged O
to O
- O
day O
, O
" O
said O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
. O
" O
She O
is O
not O
mistaken O
, O
though O
, O
" O
exclaimed O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
standing O
at O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
windows O

" O
for O
here O
they O
both O
are O
, O
true O
enough O
, O
and O
riding O
quite O
fast O
down O
the O
avenue O
. O
However O
, O
the O
mystery O
will O
soon O
be O
solved O
. O
" O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
and O
Edward S-PERSON
entered O
almost O
immediately O
afterward O
, O
the O
latter O
evidently O
very O
much O
agitated O
, O
the O
former O
so O
tranquil O
and O
cheerful O
that O
the O
momentary O
anxiety O
of O
his O
wife O
was O
calmed O
directly O
. O
He O
laughed O
at O
their O
bewilderment O
, O
and O
said O
that O
an O
important O
letter O
had O
reached O
him O
at O
Ashburton S-GPE
, O
summoning O
him O
to O
Plymouth S-GPE
, O
and O
so O
he O
thought O
he O
would O
just O
see O
how O
all O
was O
going O
on O
at O
Oakwood S-GPE
first S-ORDINAL
. O
This O
was O
not O
at O
all O
a O
satisfactory O
reason O
from O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
. O
Edward S-PERSON
evidently O
tried O
to O
answer O
Ellen's S-PERSON
inquiries O
quietly O
, O
but O
he O
could O
not O
, O
and O
exclaiming O
, O
" O
You O
tell O
her O
, O
my O
dear O
uncle O
! O
I O
can O
not O
, O
" O
ran O
out O
of O
the O
room O
. O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
instantly O
changed O
his O
jesting O
manner O
, O
so O
far O
as O
quietly O
and O
affectionately O
to O
seat O
his O
niece O
beside O
him O
, O
and O
tell O
her O
, O
cautiously O
and O
kindly O
, O
the O
real O
cause O
of O
their O
unexpected O
return O
. O
Orders O
had O
been O
sent O
to O
the B-LOC
Sea I-LOC
Queen E-LOC
, O
to O
sail O
much O
sooner O
than O
was O
expected O
, O
and O
therefore O
he O
had O
deferred O
his O
business O
, O
and O
returned O
with O
Edward S-PERSON
directly O
. O
" O
It O
is O
a O
trial O
, O
my O
dear O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
a O
very O
hard O
one O
just O
now O
, O
under O
all O
circumstances O
| | O
but O
I O
am O
sure O
you O
will O
bear O
it O
with O
fortitude O
, O
for O
Edward's S-PERSON
sake O
. O
The O
only O
drawback O
to O
his O
happiness O
in O
being O
again O
permitted O
to O
follow O
his O
profession O
, O
is O
the O
thought O
of O
the O
trial O
, O
it O
will O
be O
to O
you O
. O
" O
" O
But O
when O
must O
we O
part O
? O
When O
must O
he O
leave O
Oakwood S-GPE
? O
" O
was O
all O
poor O
Ellen S-PERSON
could O
ask O
| | O
but O
in O
such O
a O
tone O
of O
quiet O
sorrow O
, O
her O
uncle O
could O
not O
for O
the O
moment O
reply O
. O
" O
The O
Sea O
Queen O
leaves O
Plymouth S-GPE
, O
wind O
permitting O
, O
the O
end O
of O
the O
week O
, O
but O
— O
Edward S-PERSON
must O
be O
on O
board O
to O
- O
morrow O
. O
" O
A O
low O
cry O
escaped O
involuntarily O
from O
Ellen's S-PERSON
lips O
, O
as O
she O
buried O
her O
face O
on O
the O
cushion O
of O
the O
couch O
where O
she O
was O
sitting O
, O
and O
an O
exclamation O
of O
surprise O
and O
regret O
broke O
from O
all O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
felt O
it O
almost O
as O
much O
as O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
from O
not O
only O
her O
own O
unspoken O
anxiety O
, O
as O
to O
whether O
indeed O
his O
home O
influence O
would O
save O
him O
from O
temptation O
in O
future O
, O
but O
that O
she O
could O
enter O
into O
every O
thought O
and O
feeling O
which O
in O
Ellen S-PERSON
must O
so O
aggravate O
the O
actual O
parting O
— O
always O
a O
sorrow O
in O
itself O
. O
After O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes E-TIME
Ellen S-PERSON
raised O
her O
head O
, O
and O
, O
though O
her O
cheek O
was O
perfectly O
colorless O
, O
every O
tear O
was O
checked O
. O
" O
Tell O
Edward S-PERSON
he O
need O
not O
fear O
my O
weakness O
, O
dear O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
" O
she O
said O
, O
trying O
hard O
to O
speak O
quite O
calmly O
. O
" O
Only O
beg O
him O
to O
come O
to O
me O
, O
that O
we O
may O
spend O
the O
little O
time O
we O
have O
together O

I O
will O
be O
as O
cheerful O
as O
himself O

" O
And O
, O
effort O
as O
it O
was O
, O
she O
kept O
her O
word O

so O
controlling O
sorrow O
, O
to O
enter O
into O
his O
naturally O
glad O
anticipations O
, O
that O
her O
brother O
felt O
as O
if O
he O
could O
not O
love O
, O
nor O
venerate O
her O
enough O
. O
He O
was O
obliged O
to O
leave O
Oakwood S-GPE
( O
accompanied O
by O
his O
uncle O
) O
so O
early B-TIME
the I-TIME
next I-TIME
morning E-TIME
, O
that O
all O
his O
preparations O
had O
to O
be O
completed O
by O
that B-TIME
night E-TIME
. O
Ellis's S-PERSON
activity O
, O
though O
she O
could O
not O
endure O
the O
idea O
of O
his O
going O
, O
speedily O
and O
satisfactorily O
settled O
that O
matter O
. O
Robert B-PERSON
Langford E-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
only O
regained O
his O
natural O
light O
- O
heartedness O
since O
Ellen S-PERSON
had O
taken O
her O
usual O
place O
in O
the O
family O
, O
always O
declaring O
his O
carelessness O
had O
been O
the O
origin O
of O
all O
her O
misery O
, O
was O
another O
so O
active O
in O
his O
service O
, O
that O
Edward S-PERSON
had O
only O
to O
give O
a O
hint O
of O
any O
thing O
he O
wanted O
, O
even O
if O
it O
could O
only O
be O
procured O
at O
some O
distance O
, O
and O
it O
was O
instantly O
obtained O
. O
The O
hours O
wore O
on O
, O
the O
evening O
devotions O
were O
concluded O
, O
but O
still O
the O
family O
lingered O
in O
the O
library O
: O
so O
many O
things O
there O
seemed O
to O
say O
, O
for O
Mr. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
and O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
would O
not O
let O
the O
conversation O
flag O
, O
and O
Edward S-PERSON
would O
talk O
and O
laugh O
, O
as O
if O
he O
were O
only O
going O
from O
home O
for O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
days E-DATE
. O
Midnight S-TIME
chimed O
, O
but O
still O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
felt O
as O
if O
she O
could O
not O
give O
the O
signal O
for O
separation O
: O
but O
when O
one O
struck O
, O
there O
was O
a O
general O
start O
, O
and O
an O
unanimous O
declaration O
it O
could O
not O
be O
so O
late O
. O
" O
I O
assure O
you O
it O
is O
, O
" O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
cheerfully O
said O

" O
and O
poor O
Edward S-PERSON
will O
get O
no O
sleep O
, O
if O
we O
do O
not O
separate O
at O
once O
. O
He O
must O
certainly O
send O
you O
a O
box O
of O
artificial O
roses O
, O
for O
this O
unusual O
dissipation O
will O
bear O
all O
the O
natural O
ones O
away O
. O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
love O
, O
I O
must O
be O
cruel O
enough O
to O
resist O
that O
pleading O
look O

remember O

your O
full O
strength O
has O
not O
yet O

. O
" O
She O
spoke O
kindly O
, O
but O
firmly O
, O
and O
there O
was O
a O
general O
move O
. O
Edward S-PERSON
laughingly O
promised O
to O
send O
his O
cousins O
the O
very O
best O
box O
of O
rouge O
he O
could O
procure O
at O
Plymouth S-GPE
, O
and O
wished O
them O
good O
night O
as O
gayly O
as O
if O
they O
should O
meet O
as O
usual O
the B-TIME
next I-TIME
morning E-TIME
. O
Once O
only O
his O
voice O
faltered O
— O
" O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
love O
, O
good O
night O
! O
My O
own O
sister O

you O

were O
all O
he O
said O
, O
the O
last O
sentence O
escaping O
as O
if O
involuntarily O
, O
as O
if O
he O
had O
merely O
meant O
to O
say O
good O
night O

and O
for O
more B-TIME
than I-TIME
a I-TIME
minute E-TIME
the O
brother O
and O
sister O
were O
clasped O
in O
each O
other's O
arms O
. O
There O
were O
tears O
in O
Mrs. O
Hamilton's S-PERSON
eyes O
, O
and O
her O
husband's O
were O
most O
unwontedly O
dim O
, O
for O
words O
were O
not O
needed O
to O
reveal O
to O
them O
the O
trial O
of O
that O
moment O
to O
those O
two S-CARDINAL
young O
hearts O

To O
Ellen's S-PERSON
especially O
, O
for O
her O
lot O
was O
woman's O
— O
to O
endure O
until O
time O
should O
prove O
the O

him O
indeed O

noble O

soon O

he O
could O
speak O

his O

she O
knows O
where O

come O
to O
you O

" O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
knew O
the O
human O
heart O
well O

When O
she O
went O
to O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
the O
paroxysm O
of O
natural O
sorrow O
had O
had O
vent O
, O
and O
her O
sympathy O
, O
her O
earnestly O
expressed O
conviction O
that O
the O
trial O
of O
beholding O
error O
and O
remorse O
in O
one O
so O
beloved O
would O
not O
occur O
again O

could O
bring O
comfort O

The O
tears O
indeed O
might O
still O

flowed O
the O
faster O
, O
perhaps O
, O
at O
the O
voice O
of O
kindness O

there O
was O
healing O
in O
them O

when O
her O
aunt O
left O
her O
to O
go O
to O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
she O
sent O
him O
a O
fond O
message O
that O
she O
was O
better O
, O

in O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
days E-DATE
would O
be O
happy O

quite O
happy O
, O
for O
his O

It O
was O
late O
before O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
quitted O
her O
nephew O

We O
will O
not O
repeat O
all O
that O
passed O

all O
that O
that O
fond O
watchful O
relative O
so O
earnestly O

said O

Not O
much O
in O
actual O
words O
of O
counsel O
had O
she O
ever O
before O
addressed O
to O
him O
, O
feeling O
that O
that O
duty O
was O
better O
performed O
by O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
and O
his O
uncle O

She O
had O
simply O
tried O
to O
influence O
him O
by O
the O
power O
of O
love O
, O
of O
forbearance O

of O
sympathy O
with O
his O
remorse O

In O
the O
wretchedness O
, O
the O
fearful O
anxiety O
, O
Ellen's S-PERSON
danger O
and O
painful O
illness O
had O
occasioned O
herself O
individually O

she O
had O
never O
spoken O

even O
let O
fall O
a O
sentence O

could O
reproach O
him O
as O
the O
cause O
of O
all O

therefore O
, O
now O
that O
she O
did O
give O
her O
anxious O
affection O
words O

they O
were O
so O
spoken O

never O
forgot O
them O

your O

scorn O

how O
came O
it O
yours O

" O
" O
He O
came O
to O
me O

for O
his O
last O

entreating O
me O
to O
exchange O
Bibles O

him O

that O
in O
our O
most O
serious O
moments O
we O
might O
think O
of O
each O

It O
was O
such O
an O
unusually O
serious O
speech O
for O
him O
, O
that O
it O
seemed O
to O
thrill O
me O
with O
a O
vague O
forboding O
, O
which O
was O
only O
too O
soon O
realized O
. O
I O
never O
saw O
him O
again O

that O
little O
book O
indeed O
increased O
in O
value O
. O
" O
Her O
voice O
faltered O
, O
for O
even O
yet O
the O
memory O
of O
her O
brother O
was O
so O
dear O
to O
her O
that O
she O
could O
never O
speak O

him O

emotion O

Edward S-PERSON
reiterated O
his O
eager O
assurance O
that O
it O
should O
be O
equally O
valuable O
to O
him O

adding O
— O
" O
I O
have O
often O
had O
strange O
fancies O
about O
uncle O

longed O
for O

scour O

never O

drowned O

to O

telling O

weakening O

only O

prevent O
one S-CARDINAL

many O

not O
now O
indeed O
become O
— O
alike O
as O
their O
dispositions O
naturally O
were O
| | O
but O
she O
was O
more O
quietly O
, O
enduringly O
happy O
than O
she O
had O
ever O
remembered O
her O
self O
. O
There O
was O
only O
one S-CARDINAL
alloy O
, O
one O
sad O
thought O
, O
that O
would O
intrude O
causing O
a O
resolution O
, O
which O
none O
suspected O
| | O
for O
, O
open O
as O
she O
had O
become O
, O
she O
could O
breathe O
it O
to O
none O
but O
Ellis S-PERSON
, O
for O
she O
alone O
could O
assist O
her O
, O
though O
it O
required O
many O
persuasions O
and O
many O
assurances O
, O
that O
she O
never O
could O
be O
quite O
happy O
, O
unless O
it O
was O
accomplished O
, O
which O
could O
prevail O
on O
her O
to O
grant O
it O
. O
Ellen S-PERSON
knew O
, O
felt O
, O
more O
and O
more O
each O
week O
, O
that O
she O
could O
not O
rest O
till O
she O
had O
labored O
for O
and O
obtained O
, O
and O
returned O
into O
her O
aunt's O
hands O
the O
full O
sum O
she O
had O
so O
involuntarily O
appropriated O
. O
The O
only O
means O
she O
could O
adopt O
demanded O
such O
a O
seemingly O
interminable O
period O
of O
self O
- O
denial O
, O
patience O
, O
and O
perseverance O
, O
that O
at O
first O
as O
Ellis S-PERSON
represented O
and O
magnified O
all O
connected O
with O
it O
, O
she O
felt O
as O
if O
, O
indeed O
, O
she O
could O
not O
nerve O
herself O
for O
the O
task O
, O
much O
as O
she O
desired O
to O
perform O
it O
| | O
but O
prayer O
enabled O
her O
to O
face O
the O
idea O
, O
till O
it O
lost O
its O
most O
painful O
aspect O
, O
and O
three B-DATE
months E-DATE
after O
Edward's S-PERSON
departure O
she O
commenced O
the O
undertaking O
, O
resolved O
that O
neither O
time O
nor O
difficulty O
should O
deter O
her O
from O
its O
accomplishment O
. O
What O
her O
plan O
was O
, O
and O
whether O
it O
succeeded O
, O
we O
may O
not O
here O
inform O
our O
readers O
. O
Should O
we O
be O
permitted O
to O
resume O
our O
History B-WORK_OF_ART
of I-WORK_OF_ART
the I-WORK_OF_ART
Hamilton I-WORK_OF_ART
Family E-WORK_OF_ART
, O
both O
will O
be O
revealed O
. O
Greatly O
to O
Caroline's O
delight O
, O
the B-DATE
following I-DATE
October E-DATE
was O
fixed O
for O
them O
to O
leave O
Oakwood S-GPE
, O
and O
, O
after O
a O
pleasant O
tour O
, O
to O
make O
the O
long O
anticipated O
visit O
to O
London S-GPE
. O
There O
would O
then O
be O
three S-CARDINAL
or O
four S-CARDINAL
months' O
quiet O
for O
her O
to O
have O
the O
benefit O
of O
masters O
, O
before O
she O
was O
introduced O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
fondly O
hoped O
, O
that O
the O
last O
year's O
residence O
at O
home O
, O
fraught O
as O
it O
had O
been O
with O
so O
much O
of O
domestic O
trial O
, O
and O
displaying O
so O
many O
hopeful O
and O
admirable O
traits O
in O
Caroline's S-PERSON
disposition O
, O
would O
have O
lessened O
the O
danger O
of O
the O
ordeal O
of O
admiration O
and O
gayety O
which O
she O
so O
dreaded O
for O
her O
child O
— O
whether O
it O
had O
or O
not O
, O
a O
future O
page O
will O
disclose O
. O
To O
Emmeline S-PERSON
this O
arrangement O
was O
a O
source O
of O
extreme O
regret O
, O
individually O
, O
in O
which O
Ellen S-PERSON
now O
quite O
sympathized O
. O
But O
Emmeline S-PERSON
had O
never O
forgotten O
her O
mother's O
gentle O
hint O
, O
that O
too O
great O
indulgence O
of O
regret O
or O
sorrow O
becomes O
selfishness O
, O
and O
she O
tried O
very O
hard O
to O
create O
some O
anticipation O
of O
pleasure O
, O
even O
in O
London S-GPE
. O
Ellen S-PERSON
would O
not O
look O
to O
pleasure O
, O
but O
merely O
tried O
to O
think O
about O
— O
and O
so O
, O
when O
called O
upon O
, O
cheerfully O
to O
resign O
that O
which O
was O
now O
so O
intensely O
enjoyable O
— O
her O
studies O
with O
her O
aunt O
— O
and O
so O
benefit O
by O
them O
as O
to O
give O
Miss O
Harcourt S-PERSON
no O
trouble O
when O
she O
was O
again O
under O
her O
care O
| | O
as O
she O
knew O
she O
and O
Emmeline S-PERSON
must O
be O
, O
more O
than O
they O
had O
been O
yet O
, O
when O
Caroline's S-PERSON
introduction O
, O
and O
their O
residence O
in O
London S-GPE
, O
would O
take O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
so O
much O
from O
domestic O
pursuits O
and O
pleasures O
, O
and O
, O
even O
when O
at O
home O
, O
compel O
them O
to O
be O
so O
frequently O
engrossed O
with O
a O
large O
circle O
of O
friends O
, O
and O
all O
the O
variety O
of O
claims O
on O
their O
attention O
and O
time O
, O
which O
a O
season O
in O
London S-GPE
includes O
. O
It O
was O
again O
the B-DATE
7th I-DATE
of I-DATE
June E-DATE
, O
and O
Ellen's S-PERSON
birthday O
. O
Accustomed O
from O
the O
time O
she O
became O
an O
inmate O
of O
Oakwood S-GPE
to O
regard O
the O
anniversary O
of O
her O
birth O
in O
the O
same O
serious O
light O
as O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
had O
taught O
her O
cousins O
— O
as O
a O
day O
of O
quiet O
reflection O
, O
as O
well O
as O
of O
thankfulness O
and O
joy O
, O
as O
one O
that O
, O
closing O
and O
recommencing O
another O
year O
of O
their O
individual O
lives O
, O
taught O
them O
that O
they O
were O
becoming O
more O
and O
more O
responsible O
beings O
— O
it O
was O
not O
much O
wonder O
that O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
the O
whole O
of O
that O
day O
, O
should O
seem O
somewhat O
less O
cheerful O
than O
usual O
. O
She O
had O
indeed O
had O
many O
sources O
of O
thankfulness O
and O
joy O
during O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
year E-DATE
, O
but O
a O
heart O
and O
mind O
like O
hers O
could O
not O
recall O
its O
principal O
event O
without O
a O
return O
of O
sorrow O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
would O
not O
notice O
her O
now O
unusual O
sadness O
until O
the O
evening O
, O
when O
perceiving O
her O
standing O
engrossed O
in O
thought O
beside O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
widely O
- O
opened O
windows O
, O
near O
which O
Caroline S-PERSON
was O
watering O
some O
lovely O
flowers O
on O
the O
terrace O
, O
she O
gently O
approached O
her O
, O
and O
, O
putting O
her O
arm O
round O
her O
, O
said O
, O
fondly O
— O
" O
You O
have O
thought O
quite O
seriously O
and O
quite O
long O
enough O
for O
to O
- O
day O
, O
my O
dear O
Ellen S-PERSON
| | O
I O
must O
not O
have O
any O
more O
such O
very O
silent O
meditations O
. O
That O
there O
is O
something O
to O
regret O
in O
the O
retrospect O
of O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
year E-DATE
, O
I O
acknowledge O
, O
but O
you O
must O
not O
let O
it O
poison O
all O
the O
sources O
of O
thankfulness O
which O
it O
brings O
likewise O
. O
" O
" O
It O
was O
not O
of O
my O
past O

this O
moment O

" O
replied O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
sudden O
burst O
of O
emotion O
, O
most O
unusual O
to O
her O
controlled O
and O
gentle O
character O

unhappy O

this O

more O

more O
than O

My O

poor O

my O
dangerous O

mental O
health O

me O

forgetting O
all O
the O
care O

misery O

my O
conduct O

caused O

dear O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
and O
, O
therefore O
, O
I O
would O
not O
return O
them O
to O
your O
own O
care O
, O
till O
I O
could O
add O
to O
them O
a O
birthday O
- O
gift O
, O
" O
and O
, O
lifting O
the O
upper O
tray O
, O
she O
took O
out O
a O
gold O
chain O
, O
and O
a O
pair O
of O
bracelets O
of O
chaste O
and O
beautiful O
workmanship O
— O
" O
that O
the O
sad O
memories O
of O
the O
one O
may O
be O
forgotten O
in O
the O
pleasant O
thoughts O
of O
the O
other O
. O
I O
have O
only O
one S-CARDINAL
condition O
to O
make O
, O
" O
she O
added O
, O
in O
an O
earnest O
lower O
tone O
, O
as O
Ellen S-PERSON
tried O
to O
speak O
her O
thanks O
, O
but O
could O
only O
cling O
to O
her O
aunt's O
neck O
and O
weep O
. O
" O
If O
ever O
again O
you O
are O
tempted O
to O
dispose O
of O
them O
, O
dearest O
, O
promise O
me O
to O
bring O
them O
to O
me O
, O
for O
my O
valuation O
first S-ORDINAL
. O
" O
" O
You O
shall O
be O
put O
into O
fetters O
at O
once O
, O
Ellen S-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
Emmeline S-PERSON
joyously O
, O
as O
her O
cousin O
gave O
the O
required O
promise O
, O
so O
eagerly O
, O
that O
it O
was O
evident O
, O
she O
felt O
how O
much O
security O
dwelt O
in O
it O
. O
" O
Mamma O
, O
make O
her O
put O
them O
on O

I O
want O
to O
see O
if O
she O
looks O
as O
interesting O
as O
Zenobia S-PERSON
did O
in O
her O
golden O
chains O
. O
" O
" O
I O
think O
you O
might O
find O
a O
prettier O
simile O
, O
Emmeline S-PERSON
, O
" O
replied O
Mrs. O
Hamilton S-PERSON
, O
smiling O
, O
as O
she O
granted O
her O
request O
, O
by O
throwing O
the O
chain O
round O
Ellen's O
neck O
, O
and O
fastening O
the O
bracelets O
on O
her O
wrists O
. O
" O
So O
I O
can O
, O
and O
so O
I O
will O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
lively O
girl O
, O
altering O
, O
without O
the O
smallest O
hesitation O
, O
the O
lines O
to O
suit O
her O
fancy O
— O
" O
For O
thee O
, O
rash O
girl O
, O
no O
suppliant O
sues O

For O
thee O
may O
vengeance O
claim O
her O
dues O

Who O
, O
nurtured O
underneath O
our O
smile O
, O
Repaid O
our O
cares O
with O
treacherous O
wile O
. O
Dishonoring O
thus O
thy O
loyal O
name O
, O
Fetters O
and O
warders O
thou O
must O
claim O
. O
The O
chain O
of O
gold O
was O
quick O
unstrung O
, O
Its O
links O
on O
that O
fair O
neck O
were O
flung O
| | O
Then O
gently O
drew O
the O
glittering O
band O
, O
And O
laid O
the O
clasp O
on O
Ellen's S-PRODUCT
hand O
. O
