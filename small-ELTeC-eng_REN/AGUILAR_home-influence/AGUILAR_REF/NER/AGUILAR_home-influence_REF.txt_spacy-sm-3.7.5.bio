beauty O
, O
showing O
not O
only O
ingenuity O
but O
observation O
  O
and O
|
      | O
one B-DATE
lovely I-DATE
summer I-DATE
evening O
the O
ceremony O
of O
launching O
took O
place O
. O
For O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
she O
tottered O
|
      | O
and O
reeled O
amid O
the O
tiny O
breakers O
, O
then O
suddenly O
regained O
her O
equilibrium O
and O
dashed O
gallantly O
|
      | O
along O
. O
A O
loud O
shout O
burst O
from O
the O
group O
, O
from O
all O
save O
the O
owner O
, O
a O
beautiful O
boy O
of O
some O
|
      | O
twelve B-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
who O
contented O
himself O
with O
raising O
his O
slight O
figure O
to O
its O
full O
height O
, O
and O
|
      | O
looking O
proudly O
and O
triumphantly O
round O
him O
. O
One B-CARDINAL
glance O
would O
suffice O
to O
satisfy O
that O
his O
rank O
|
      | O
in O
life O
was O
far O
superior O
to O
that O
of O
his O
companions O
, O
and O
that O
he O
condescended O
from O
|
      | O
circumstances O
, O
not O
from O
choice O
, O
to O
mingle O
with O
them O
. O
So O
absorbed O
was O
the O
general O
attention O
|
      | O
that O
the O
very O
unusual O
sound O
of O
carriage O
- O
wheels O
was O
unremarked O
until O
close O
beside O
them O
, O
and O
|
      | O
then O
so O
astounding O
was O
the O
sight O
of O
a O
private O
carriage O
and O
the O
coachman O
's O
very O
simple O
question O
|
      | O
if O
that O
road O
led O
to O
the O
village O
, O
that O
all O
hung O
back O
confused O
. O
The O
owner O
of O
the O
little O
vessel O
, O
|
      | O
however O
, O
answered O
proudly O
and O
briefly O
in O
the O
affirmative O
. O
" O
And O
can O
you O
direct O
me O
, O
my O
good O
|
      | O
boy O
, O
" O
inquired O
a O
lady O
, O
looking O
from O
the O
window O
, O
and O
smiling O
kindly O
at O
the O
abashed O
group O
" O
to O
|
      | O
the O
residence O
of O
Mrs. O
Fortescue B-PERSON
, O
it O
is O
out O
of O
the O
village O
, O
is O
it O
not O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Mrs. O
Fortescue B-PERSON
! O
" O
repeated O
the O
boy O
eagerly O
and O
gladly O
, O
and O
his O
cap O
was O
off O
his O
head O
in O
a O
|
      | O
moment O
, O
and O
the O
bright O
sunshine O
streamed O
on O
a O
face O
of O
such O
remarkable O
beauty O
, O
and O
withal O
so O
|
      | O
familiar O
, O
that O
though O
the O
lady O
bent O
eagerly O
forward O
to O
address O
him O
, O
emotion O
so O
choked O
her O
|
      | O
voice O
that O
the O
lad O
was O
enabled O
to O
reply O
to O
her O
inquiry O
, O
and O
direct O
the O
coachman O
to O
the O
only O
|
      | O
inn O
of O
the O
village O
, O
and O
they O
had O
driven O
off O
before O
words O
returned O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
boy O
looked O
eagerly O
after O
them O
, O
then O
desiring O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
his O
companions O
to O
meet O
the O
lady O
at O
|
      | O
the O
inn O
, O
and O
guide O
her O
to O
the O
cottage O
, O
caught O
up O
his O
little O
vessel O
, O
and O
darted O
off O
across O
some O
|
      | O
fields O
which O
led O
by O
a O
shorter O
cut O
to O
the O
same O
place O
. O
| 
  | O
It O
was O
a O
very O
humble O
dwelling O
, O
so O
surrounded O
by O
hills O
that O
their O
shadow O
always O
seemed O
to O
|
      | O
overhang O
it O
: O
yet O
within O
, O
the O
happy O
temper O
of O
a O
poor O
widow O
and O
her O
daughter O
kept O
up O
a O
perpetual O
|
      | O
sunshine O
. O
Three B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
previous O
to O
the O
evening O
we O
have O
mentioned O
, O
a O
lady O
and O
two B-CARDINAL
children O
had O
|
      | O
arrived O
at O
Llangwillan B-ORG
, O
unable O
to O
proceed O
farther O
from O
the O
severe O
indisposition O
of O
the O
former O
. O
|
      | O
They O
were O
unattended O
, O
and O
the O
driver O
only O
knew O
that O
their O
destination O
was O
Swansea O
  O
he O
believed O
|
      | O
they O
had O
been O
shipwrecked O
off O
Pembroke B-ORG
, O
and O
that O
the O
poor O
lady O
was O
very O
ill O
when O
she O
commenced O
|
      | O
her O
journey O
, O
but O
the O
curious O
inquiries O
of O
the O
villagers O
could O
elicit O
nothing O
more O
. O
Mr. O
Myrvin B-PERSON
, O
|
      | O
with O
characteristic O
benevolence O
, O
devoted O
himself O
to O
insuring O
, O
as O
far O
as O
he O
could O
, O
the O
comfort O
|
      | O
of O
the O
invalid O
  O
had O
her O
removed O
from O
the O
inn O
to O
Widow B-PERSON
Morgan I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
cottage O
, O
confident O
that O
there O
|
      | O
she O
would O
at O
least O
be O
nursed O
with O
tenderness O
and O
care O
, O
and O
so O
near O
him O
as O
to O
permit O
his O
|
      | O
constant O
watchfulness O
. O
But O
a B-DATE
very I-DATE
few I-DATE
days I-DATE
too O
sadly O
convinced O
him O
, O
not O
only O
that O
her O
disease O
|
      | O
was O
mortal O
, O
but O
that O
his O
presence O
and O
gentle O
accents O
irritated O
instead O
of O
soothed O
. O
Ill O
- O
temper O
|
      | O
and O
self O
- O
will O
seemed O
to O
increase O
with O
the O
weakness O
, O
which O
every B-DATE
day I-DATE
rendered O
her O
longing O
to O
|
      | O
continue O
her O
journey O
more O
and O
more O
futile O
. O
It O
was O
some B-DATE
days I-DATE
before O
she O
could O
even O
be O
persuaded O
|
      | O
to O
write O
to O
the O
relative O
she O
was O
about O
to O
seek O
, O
so O
determined O
was O
she O
that O
she O
would O
get O
well O
  O
|
      | O
and O
when O
the O
letter O
was O
forwarded O
, O
and O
long O
before O
an O
answer O
could O
have O
been O
received O
( O
for O
|
      | O
twenty B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
there O
were O
no O
railroads O
to O
carry O

epistolary O
communication O
as O
now O
) O
, O
|
      | O
fretfulness O
and O
despondency O
increased O
physical O
suffering O
, O
by O
the O
determined O
conviction O
that O
|
      | O
she O
was O
abandoned O
, O
her O
children O
would O
be O
left O
uncared O
for O
. O
In O
vain O
Mr. O
Myrvin B-PERSON
assured O
her O
of O
|
      | O
the O
impossibility O
yet O
to O
receive O
a O
reply O
, O
that O
the O
direction O
might O
not O
even O
have O
been O
distinct O
|
      | O
enough O
, O
for O
her O
memory O
had O
failed O
her O
in O
dictating O
it O
  O
she O
knew O
she O
was O
deserted O
, O
she O
might O
|
      | O
have O
deserved O
it O
, O
but O
her O
Edward B-PERSON
was O
innocent O
, O
and O
it O
was O
very O
hard O
on O
him O
. O
As O
self O
- O
will O
|
      | O
subsided O
in O
physical O
exhaustion O
, O
misery O
increased O
. O
A O
restless O
torturing O
remembrance O
seemed O
to O
|
      | O
have O
taken O
possession O
of O
her O
, O
which O
all O
the O
efforts O
of O
the O
earnest O
clergyman O
were O
utterly O
|
      | O
ineffectual O
to O
remove O
. O
She O
would O
not O
listen O
to O
the O
peace O
he O
proffered O
, O
and O
so O
painfully O
did O
|
      | O
his O
gentle O
eloquence O
appear O
to O
irritate O
instead O
of O
calm O
, O
that O
he O
desisted O
, O
earnestly O
praying O
, O
|
      | O
that O
her O
sister O
might O
answer O
the O
letter O
in O
person O
, O
and O
by O
removing O
anxiety O
prepare O
the O
mind O
|
      | O
for O
better O
thoughts O
. O
| 
  | O
One B-CARDINAL
object O
alone O
had O
power O
to O
bring O
something O
like O
a O
smile O
to O
that O
altered O
but O
still O
most O
|
      | O
beautiful O
countenance O
, O
conquer O
even O
irritation O
, O
and O
still O
create O
intervals O
of O
pleasure O
— O
it O
was O
|
      | O
her O
son O
, O
the O
same O
beautiful O
boy O
we O
have O
already O
noticed O
, O
and O
whose O
likeness O
to O
herself O
was O
so O
|
      | O
extraordinary O
that O
it O
would O
have O
been O
almost O
too O
feminine O
a O
beauty O
, O
had O
it O
not O
been O
for O
the O
|
      | O
sparkling O
animated O
expression O
of O
every O
feature O
, O
and O
the O
manly O
self O
- O
possession O
which O
|
      | O
characterized O
his O
every O
movement O
. O
That O
he O
should O
be O
his O
mother O
's O
idol O
was O
not O
very O
surprising O
, O
|
      | O
for O
the O
indiscreet O
and O
lavish O
indulgence O
which O
had O
been O
his O
from O
birth O
, O
had O
not O
yet O
had O
power O
|
      | O
to O
shake O
his O
doating O
fondness O
for O
his O
mother O
, O
or O
interfere O
with O
her O
happiness O
by O
the O
visible O

      | O
display O
of O
the O
faults O
which O
her O
weakness O
had O
engendered O

Caressingly O
affectionate O
, O
|
      | O
open O
- O
hearted O
, O
generous O
, O
and O
ever O
making O
her O
his O
first B-ORDINAL
object O
, O
perhaps O
even O
a O
more O
penetrating O
|
      | O
mother O
would O
have O
seen O
nothing O
to O
dread O
but O
all O
to O
love O
. O
His O
uncontrolled O
passion O
at O
the O

      | O
slightest O
cross O
, O
his O
haughty O
pride O
and O
indomitable O
will O
toward O
all O
save O
her O
, O
but O
increased O
her O
|
      | O
affection O
. O
And O
when O
he O
was O
with O
her O
, O
which O
he O
was O
very O
often O
, O
considering O
that O
a O
sick O
close O

      | O
room O
would O
have O
been O
utterly O
repugnant O

it O
not O
contained O
his O
mother O
, O
Mrs. O
Fortescue B-PERSON
|
      | O
was O
actually O
happy O
. O
But O
it O
was O
a O
happiness O
only O
increasing O
her O
intensity O
of O
suffering O
when O
her O
|
      | O
son O
was O
absent O
. O
Hide O
it O
from O
herself O
as O
she O
might O
, O
the O
truth O
would O
press O
upon O
her O
that O
she O
was O
|
      | O
dying O
, O
and O
her O
darling O
must O
be O
left O
to O
the O
care O
of O
relations O
indeed O
, O
but O
utter O
strangers O
to O

      | O
him O
, O
and O
unlikely O
to O
treat O
him O
as O
she O
had O
done O
. O
She O
knew O
that O
he O
had O
, O
what O
strict O

      | O
disciplinarians O
, O
as O
she O
chose O
to O
regard O
her O
sister O

her O
husband O
, O
would O
term O
and O
treat O
as O
|
      | O
serious O
faults O
, O
while O
she O
felt O
them O
actually O
virtues O
  O
and O
agony O
for O
him O
in O
the O
dread O
of O
what O
|
      | O
he O
might O
be O
called O
upon O
to O
endure O
, O
would O
deluge O
her O
pillow O
with O
passionate O
tears O

shake O

her O
slight O

The O
day O

Edward B-PERSON

toward O
evening B-TIME
Mrs. O

      | O
Fortescue B-ORG
awoke O
from O
a O
troubled O
sleep O
to O
brood O
over O
these O
thoughts O

till O
they O
had O
produced O

      | O
their O
usual O
effect O
in O
tears O

sobs O
, O
the O
more O
painful O

witness O
from O
the O
increasing O
physical O

      | O
incapacity O
to O
struggle O
with O
them O
. O

A O
little O
girl O

between B-DATE

was O
seated O
on O
a O
low O
wooden O
stool O

half B-CARDINAL

      | O
concealed O
by O
the O
coarse O

employed O

sewing O
some O
bright O

buttons O
on O
a O

It O
seemed O
hard O
work O

those O
small O

delicate O

she O
did O
not O

up O

to O
be O

spring O
up O
and O
try O
to O
soothe O
, O
but O
a O
mournful O
expression O
quickly O
succeeded O
, O
and O
she O
sat O
|
      | O
several B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
without O
moving O
. O
At O
length O
, O
as O
Mrs. O
Fortescue B-PERSON
's O
sobs O
seemed O
almost O
to O
suffocate O
|
      | O
her O
, O
the O
child O
gently O
bent O
over O
her O
, O
saying O
, O
very O
timidly O
, O
" O
Dear O
mamma O
, O
shall O
I O
call O
widow O

      | O
Morgan B-PERSON
, O
or O
can O
I O
get O
any O
thing O
for O
you O
? O
" O
and O
, O
without O
waiting O
for O
a O
reply O
, O
save O
the O
angry O
|
      | O
negative O
to O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
question O
, O
she O
held O
a O
glass O
of O
water O
to O
her O
mother O
's O
lips O
and O
bathed O
her O
|
      | O
forehead O
. O
After O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
Mrs. O
Fortescue B-PERSON
revived O
sufficiently O
to O
inquire O
where O
Edward B-PERSON
|
      | O
was O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
He O
has O
gone O
down O
to O
the O
stream O
to O
launch O
his O
little O
frigate O
, O
mamma O
, O
and O
asked O
me O
to O
fasten O
|
      | O
these O
buttons O
on O
his O
jacket O
, O
to O
make O
it O
look O
like O
a O
sailor O
's O
meanwhile O
  O
I O
do O
not O
think O
he O
will O
|
      | O
be O
very O
long O
now O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Mrs. O
Fortescue B-PERSON
made O
no O
rejoinder O
, O
except O
to O
utter O
aloud O
those O
thoughts O
which O
had O
caused O
her O
|
      | O
previous O
paroxysm O
, O
and O
her O
little O
girl O
, O
after O
a O
very O
evident O
struggle O
with O
her O
own O
painful O
|
      | O
timidity O
, O
ventured O
to O
say O
: O
| 
  | O
" O
But O
why O
should O
you O
fear O
so O
much O
for O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
dear O
mamma O
? O
Every O
body O
loves O
him O
and O
admires O

      | O
him O
, O
so O
I O
am O
sure O
my O
aunt O

" O
| 
  | O
" O
Your O
aunt O
may O
for O
my O
sake O
, O
but O
she O
will O
not O
love O

bear O
with O
his O
childish O
faults O
as O
I O
have O
|
      | O
done O
  O
and O
your O
uncle O
is O
such O
a O
harsh O
, O
stern O
man O
, O
that O
there O
is O
little O
hope O
for O
his O
forbearance O

      | O
with O
my O
poor O
Edward B-PERSON
. O
And O
he O
is O
so O
frank O

bold O
, O
he O
will O
not O
know O
how O
even O
to O
conceal O
his O

      | O
boyish O
errors O

he O
will O
be O
punished O
, O

his O
fine O
spirit O
broken O

who O

there O

      | O

him O

" O
I O
may O

able O
sometimes O

indeed O
, O
indeed O

I O

" O
replied O
her O

      | O
child O
, O
with O
affecting O
earnestness O
. O
" O
I O

better O

      | O
harshness O
whenever O

in O
your O
power O
, O
" O
exclaimed O
Mrs. O
Fortescue B-PERSON
, O
so O
eagerly O
, O
that O
she O
half B-CARDINAL
|
      | O
raised O
herself O
, O
and O
pressed O
Ellen B-PERSON
to O
her O
with O
an O
appearance O
of O
affection O
so O
unusual O
, O
and O
a O
|
      | O
kiss O
so O
warm O
, O
that O
that O
moment O
never O
passed O
from O
the O
child O
's O
mind O
, O
and O
the O
promise O
she O
gave O
|
      | O
was O
registered O
in O
her O
own O
heart O
, O
with O
a O
solemnity O
and O
firmness O
of O
purpose O
little O
imagined O
by O
|
      | O
her O
mother O
, O
who O
when O
she O
demanded O
it O
, O
conceived O
neither O
its O
actual O
purport O
nor O
extent O
  O
she O
|
      | O
only O
felt O
relieved O
that O
Edward B-PERSON
would O
have O
some B-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
by O
him O
, O
to O
love O
him O
and O
enable O
him O
to O
|
      | O
conceal O
his O
errors O
, O
if O
he O
should O
commit O
any O
. O
| 
  | O
Had O
she O
studied O
and O
known O
the O
character O
of O
Ellen B-PERSON
as O
she O
did O
that O
of O
her O
son O
, O
that O
promise O

      | O
would O
perhaps O
never O
have O
been O
asked O
  O
nor O
would O
she O
so O
incautiously O
and O
mistakenly O
have O
laid O
so O
|
      | O
great O
a O
stress O
upon O
|  | O
concealment O
| | O
, O
as O
the O
only O
sure O
means O
of O
guarding O
from O
blame O
. O
From O
|
      | O
her O
childhood O
Mrs. O
Fortescue B-PERSON
had O
been O
a O
creature O
of O
passion O
and O
impulse O
, O
and O
maternity O
had O
|
      | O
unhappily O
not O
altered O
one B-CARDINAL
tittle O
of O
her O
character O
. O
In O
what O
manner O
, O
or O
at O
what O
cost O
, O
Ellen B-PERSON
|
      | O
might O
be O
enabled O
to O
keep O
that O
promise O
, O
never O
entered O
her O
mind O
. O
It O
had O
never O
been O
her O
wo O
nt O
, O

      | O
even O
in O
days B-DATE
of O
health O
, O
to O
examine O
or O
reflect O
, O
and O
present O
weakness O
permitted O
only O
the O
morbid O
|
      | O
indulgence O
of O
one O
exaggerated O
thought O
. O
| 
  | O
For O
several B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
she O
lay O
quite O
silent O
, O
and O
Ellen B-PERSON
resumed O
her O
seat O
and O
work O
, O
her O
temples O
|
      | O
throbbing O
, O
she O
knew O
not O
why O
, O
and O
a O
vain O
longing O
to O
throw O
her O
arms O
round O
her O
mother O
's O
neck O
, O
and O
|
      | O
entreat O
her O
only O
for O
one B-CARDINAL
more O
kiss O
, O
one B-CARDINAL
other O
word O
of O
love O
  O
and O
the O
consciousness O
that O
she O
|
      | O
dared O
not O
, O
caused O
the O
hot O
tears O
to O
rush O
into O
her O
eyes O
, O
and O
almost O
blind O
her O
, O
but O
she O
would O
not O
|
      | O
let O
them O
fall O
, O
for O
she O
had O
learned O
long O
ago O
, O
that O
while O
Edward B-PERSON
's O
tears O
only O
excited O
soothing O
|
      | O
and O
caresses O
, O
hers O
always O
called O
forth O
irritation O
and O
reproof O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Joy B-PERSON
, O
joy O
! O
Mother O
, O
darling O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
an O
eager O
voice O
, O
some O
minutes O
afterward O
, O
and O
Edward B-PERSON
|
      | O
bounded O
into O
the O
room O
, O
and O
throwing O
himself O
by O
his O
mother O
's O
side O
, O
kissed O
her O
pale O
cheek O
again O
|
      | O
and O
again O
. O
" O
Such O
joy O
! O
My O
ship O
sailed O
so O
beautifully O
, O
I O
quite O
longed O
for O
you O

see O
it O

you O

      | O
will O
one B-DATE

  | O
Mrs. O
Fortescue B-PERSON
pressed O
him O
closer O
and O
closer O
to O
her O
, O
returning O
his O
kisses O
with O
such O
|
      | O
passionate O
fondness O
, O
that O
tears O
mingled O
with O
them O
, O
and O
fell O
upon O
his O
cheek O
. O

" O

      | O
the O
eager O

anxious O
look O

fixed O
upon O
him O

more O

" O
No O

asked O

sadly O

the O
whole O
flight O

two B-CARDINAL

quickness O

decision O

      | O
even O
at O
that O

no O

it O
was O
only O
a O
momentary O
thought O

Mrs. O

could O
give O
to O
Ellen B-PERSON

every O
feeling O

engrossed O
in O
the O
deep O
emotion O
with O
which O
she O
gazed O
on O

altered O
face O

was O
bright O

voice O

, O
more O
than O
the O

seemed O
to O
recall O
life O

and O
after O
a O
brief O
interval O
the O
choking O
thought O
found O

      | O
words O

" O
My O

My O

my O

      | O
for O
all O

killed O
him O

I O

But O
did O
he O
curse O
me O
, O
Emmeline B-PERSON
? O
did O

      | O
all O
his O
love O
turn O

wrath O

" O
Dearest O

with O
earnest O
tenderness O
, O
" O
dismiss O
such O
painful O
|
      | O
thoughts O
at O
once O
  O
our O
poor O
father O
did O
feel O
your O
conduct O
deeply O
, O
but O
he O
forgave O
it O
, O
would O
have O
|
      | O
received O
your O
husband O
, O
caressed O
, O
loved O
you O
as O
before O
, O
had O
you O
but O
returned O
to O
him O
  O
and O
so O
|
      | O
loved O
you O
to O
the O
last O
moment O
, O
that O
your O
name O
was O
the O
last O
word O
upon O
his O
lips O
. O
But O
this O
is O
no O

      | O
subject O
for O
such O
youthful O
auditors O
, O
" O
she O
continued O
, O
interrupting O
herself O
, O
as O
she O
met O
Edward B-PERSON
's O
|
      | O
bright O
eyes O
fixed O
wonderingly O
upon O
her O
face O
, O
and O
noticed O
the O
excessive O
paleness O
of O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
|
      | O
cheek O
. O
" O
You O
look O
weary O
, O
my O
love O
, O
" O
she O
said O
, O
kindly O
, O
drawing O
her O
niece O
to O
her O
, O
and O
|
      | O
affectionately O
kissing O
her O
. O
" O
Edward B-PERSON
has O
made O
his O
own O
acquaintance O
with O
me O
, O
why O
did O
you O
not O
do O

      | O
so O
too O
? O
But O
go O
now O
into O
the O
garden O
for O
a O
little O
while O
, O
I O
am O
sure O
you O
want O
fresh O
air O
, O
and O
I O

      | O
will O
take O
your O
place O
as O
nurse O
mean O
while O
. O
Will O
you O
trust O
me O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
And O
the O
kind O
smile O
which O
accompanied O
her O
words O
gave O
Ellen B-PERSON
courage O
to O
return O
her O
kiss O
, O
but O
|
      | O
she O
left O
the O
room O
without O
speaking O
. O
Edward O
required O
more O
persuasion O
  O
and O
the O
moment O
he O
was O
|
      | O
permitted O
he O
returned O
, O
seated O
himself O
on O
a O
stool O
at O
his O
aunt O
's O
feet O
, O
laid O
his O
head O
on O
her O
lap O
, O
|
      | O
and O
remained O
for O
nearly B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour I-TIME
quite O
silent O
, O
watching O
with O
her O
the O
calm O
slumbers O
which O
had O
|
      | O
followed O
the O
agitating O
conversation O
between O
them O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
was O
irresistibly O
attracted O
|
      | O
toward O
him O
, O
and O
rather O
wondered O
that O
Ellen B-PERSON
should O
stay O
away O
so O
long O
. O
She O
did O
not O
know O
that O

      | O
Edward B-PERSON
had O
spent O
almost O
the O
whole O
of O
that B-DATE
day I-DATE
in O
the O
joyous O
sports O
natural O
to O
his O
age O
, O

      | O
that O
it O
had O
been O
many O
weary O
days O

GLIMPSES O
INTO O
A O
CHILD O
'S O
HEART.—A O
DEATHBED O
. O
| 
  | O
On O
leaving O
the O
cottage O
, O
Ellen B-PERSON
hastily O
traversed O
the O
little O
garden O
, O
and O
entered O
a O
narrow O
|
      | O
lane O
, O
leading O
to O
Mr. O
Myrvin B-PERSON
's O
dwelling O
. O
Her O
little O
heart O
was O
swelling O
high O
within O
her O
, O
and O
the O
|
      | O
confinement O
she O
had O
endured O
, O
the O
constant O
control O
she O
exercised O
for O
fear O
she O
should O
add O
to O
her O
|
      | O
mother O
's O
irritation O
, O
combined O
with O
the O
extreme O
delicacy O
of O
natural O
constitution O
, O
had O
so O
|
      | O
weakened O
her O
, O
as O
to O
render O
the O
slightest O
exertion O
painful O
. O
She O
had O
been O
so O
often O
reproved O
as O
|
      | O
fretful O
and O
ill O
- O
tempered O
, O
whenever O
in O
tears O
, O
that O
she O
always O
checked O
and O
concealed O
them O
. O
She O
|
      | O
had O
been O
so O
frequently O
told O
that O
she O
did O
not O
know O
what O
affection O
was O
, O
that O
she O
was O
so O
|
      | O
inanimate O
and O
cold O
, O
that O
though O
she O
did O
not O
understand O
the O
actual O
meaning O
of O
the O
words O
, O
she O
|
      | O
believed O
she O
was O
different O
to O
any O
one O
else O
, O
and O
was O
unhappy O
without O
knowing O
why O
. O
Compared O
with O
|
      | O
her O
brother O
, O
she O
certainly O
was O
neither O
a O
pretty O
nor O
an O
engaging O
child O
. O
Weakly O
from O
her O
birth O
, O
|
      | O
her O
residence O
in O
India B-GPE
had O
increased O
constitutional O
delicacy O
, O
and O
while O
to O
a O
watchful O
eye O
the O
|
      | O
expression O
of O
her O
countenance O
denoted O
constant O
suffering O
, O
the O
heedless O
and O
superficial O
|
      | O
observer O
would O
condemn O
it O
as O
peevishness O
, O
and O
so O
unnatural O
to O
a O
young O
child O
, O
that O
nothing O
but O
|
      | O
confirmed O
ill O
- O
temper O
could O
have O
produced O
it O
. O
The O
soft O
, O
beautifully O
- O
formed O
black O
eye O
was O
too O
|
      | O
large O
for O
her O
other O
features O
, O
and O
the O
sallowness O
of O
her O
complexion O
, O
the O
heavy O
tresses O
of O
very O
|
      | O
dark O
hair O
, O
caused O
her O
to O
be O
remarked O
as O
a O
very O
plain O
child O
, O
which O
in O
reality O
she O
was O
not O
. O
|
      | O
Accustomed B-ORG
to O
hear O
beauty O
extolled O
above O
every O
thing O
else O
, O
beholding O
it O
in O
her O
mother O
and O
|
      | O
brother O
, O
and O
imagining O
it O
was O
Edward B-PERSON
's O
great O
beauty O
that O
always O
made O
him O
so O
beloved O
and O
|
      | O
petted O
, O
an O
evil O
- O
disposed O
child O
would O
have O
felt O
nothing O
but O
envy O
and O
dislike O
toward O
him O
. O
But O
|
      | O
Ellen B-PERSON
felt O
neither O
. O
She O
loved O
him O
devotedly O
  O
but O
that O
any O
one O
could O
love O
her O
, O
now O
that O
the O
|
      | O
only O
one O
who O
ever O
had O
— O
her O
idolized O
father O
— O
was O
dead O
, O
she O
thought O
impossible O
. O
| 
  | O
Why O
her O
heart O
and O
temples O
beat O
so O
quickly O
as O
she O
left O
her O
mother O
's O
room O
— O
why O
the O
promise O
she O
|
      | O
had O
so O
lately O
made O
should O
so O
cling O
to O
her O
mind O
, O
that O
even O
her O
aunt O
's O
arrival O
could O
not O
remove O
|
      | O
it O
— O
why O
she O
felt O
so O
giddy O
and O
weak O
as O
to O
render O
walking O
painful O
, O
the O
poor O
child O
could O
not O
have O
|
      | O
told O
, O
but O
, O
unable O
at O
length O
to O
go O
farther O
, O
she O
sat O
down O
on O
a O
grassy O
bank O
, O
and O
believing O
|
      | O
herself O
quite O
alone O
, O
cried O
bitterly O
. O
Several B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
passed O
and O
she O
did O
not O
look O
up O
, O
till O
a O

      | O
well O

in O

Arthur B-PERSON

finding O

Something O

grieved O

this B-TIME

I O

you O

I O

me O

, O
what O
is O
of O
much O
more O

it O
proves O
you O

not O

all O
I O
told O
you O
of O

your O
Father O

that O
even O

inquired O
Ellen O

" O
then O
I O
can O

not O

indeed O

I O

I O

never O

" O

" O
You O
are O
not O

such O
strong O
health O
as O
your O
brother O

my O
dear O
little O
girl O

you O
have O
had O

      | O
many O
things O
to O
make O
you O
unhappy O
, O
which O
Edward B-PERSON
has O
not O

But O
you O
must O
try O
and O
remember O
that O
even O

      | O

it O
please O
God O

I O
am O
sure O
you O
have O
not O
forgotten O
the O
story O
of O
Joseph B-PERSON
that O
I O
told O
you O
a O
few O
|
      | O
Sundays B-DATE
ago I-DATE
. O
God O
so O
loved O
him O
, O
as O
to O
give O
him O
the O
power O
of O
foretelling O
future O
events O
, O
and O
|
      | O
enabling O
him O
to O
do O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
good O
, O
but O
when O
he O
was O
taken O
away O
from O
his O
father O
and O
sold O
|
      | O
as O
a O
slave O
and O
cast O
into O
prison O
among O
cruel O
strangers O

he O
could O
not O
have O
been O
very O
happy O
, O
|
      | O
Ellen B-PERSON
. O
Yet O
still O
, O
young O
as O
he O
was O
, O
little O
more O
than O
a O
child O
in O
those B-DATE
days I-DATE
, O
and O
thrown O
among O
|
      | O
those O
who O
did O
not O
know O
right O
from O
wrong O
, O
he O
remembered O
all O
that O
his O
father O
had O
taught O
him O
, O
and O
|
      | O
prayed O
to O
God O
, O
and O
tried O
to O
love O
and O
obey O
Him O
  O
and O
God O
was O
pleased O
with O
him O
, O
and O
gave O
him O

      | O
grace O
to O
continue O
good O
, O
and O
at O
last O
so O
blessed O
him O
, O
as O
to O
permit O
him O
to O
see O
his O
dear O
father O

      | O
and O
darling O
brother O
again O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
But O
Joseph B-PERSON
was O
his O
father O
's O
favorite O
child O
, O
" O
was O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
sole O
rejoinder O
  O
and O
the O
tears O
|
      | O
which O
were O
checked O
in O
the O
eagerness O
with O
which O
she O
had O
listened O
, O
seemed O
again O
ready O
to O
burst O
|
      | O
forth O
. O
" O
He O
must O
have O
been O
happy O
when O
he O
thought O
of O
that O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
do O
not O
think O
so O
, O
my O
dear O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
" O
replied O
Mr. O
Myrvin B-PERSON
, O
more O
moved O
than O
he O
chose O
to O
betray O
, O
|
      | O
" O
for O
being O
his O
father O
's O
favorite O
first B-ORDINAL
excited O
the O
dislike O
and O
envy O
of O
his O
brothers O
, O
and O
|
      | O
caused O
them O
to O
wish O
to O
send O
him O
away O
. O
There O
was O
no O
excuse O
indeed O
for O
their O
conduct O
  O
but O
|
      | O
perhaps O
if O
Joseph B-PERSON
had O
always O
remained O
near O
his O
father O
he O
might O
have O
been O
spoiled O
by O
too O
great O
|
      | O
indulgence O
, O
and O
never O
become O
as O
good O
as O
he O
afterward O
was O
. O
Perhaps O
in O
his O
solitary O
prison O
he O
|
      | O
might O
even O
have O
regretted O
that O
his O
father O
had O
not O
treated O
them O
all O
alike O
, O
as O
then O
the O
angry O
|
      | O
feelings O
of O
his O
brothers O
would O
not O
have O
been O
called O
forth O
. O
So O
you O
see O
, O
being O
a O
favorite O
will O
|
      | O
not O
always O
make O
us O
happy O
, O
Ellen B-PERSON
. O
It O
is O
indeed O
very O
delightful O
to O
be O
loved O
and O
caressed O
, O
and O
if O
|
      | O
we O
try O
to O
do O
our O
duty O
and O
love O
as O
much O
as O
we O
can O
, O
even O
if O
we O
are O
not O
sure O
of O
being O
loved O
at O
|
      | O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
we O
may O
be O
quite O
certain O
that O
we O
shall O
be O
loved O
and O
happy O
at O
last O
. O
Do O
you O
understand O
me O
, O
|
      | O
my O
child O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
The O
question O
was O
almost O
needless O
, O
for O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
large O
eyes O
had O
never O
moved O
from O
his O
face O
, O
and O
|
      | O
their O
expression O
was O
so O
full O
of O
intelligence O
and O
meaning O
, O
that O
the O
whole O
countenance O
seemed O
|
      | O
lighted O
up O
. O
" O
Then O
do O
you O
think O
mamma O
will O
recover O
? O
" O
she O
eagerly O
exclaimed O
  O
" O
will O
she O
ever O
love O
|
      | O
me?—oh B-FAC
, O
if O
I O
thought O
so O
, O
I O
could O
never O
, O
never O
be O
naughty O
again O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
She O
will O
love O
you O
, O
my O
dear O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
" O
replied O
Mr. O
Myrvin B-PERSON
, O
now O
visibly O
affected O
, O
" O
I O
can O
not O
, O
I O
|
      | O
dare O
not O
tell O
you O
that O
she O
will O
recover O
to O
love O
you O
on O
earth O
, O
but O
if O
indeed O
it O
be O
God O
's O
will O
|
      | O
that O
she O
should O
go O
to O
Him O
, O
she O
will O
look O
down O
on O
you O
from O
Heaven O
and O
love O
you O
far O
more O
than O

      | O
she O
has O
done O
yet O
, O
for O
she O
will O
know O
then O
how O
much O
you O
love O
her O
. O
" O

  | O
" O
And O
will O
she O
know O
if O
I O
do O
all O
she O
wishes O

if O
I O
love O

help O
Edward B-PERSON
? O
" O
asked O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
low O
, O
|
      | O
half B-CARDINAL
- O
frightened O
voice O
  O
and O
little O
did O
Mr. O
Myrvin B-PERSON
imagine O
how O
vividly O
and O
how O
indelibly O
his O
|
      | O
reply O
was O
registered O
in O
the O
child O
's O
memory O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
It O
is O
a O
question O
none O
can O
answer O
positively O
, O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
but O
it O
is O
my O
own O
firm O
belief O
, O
that O
the O
|
      | O
beloved O
ones O
we O
have O
lost O
are O
permitted O
to O
watch O
over O

love O
us O
still O
, O
and O
that O
they O
see O
us O

are O
often O
near O
us O

not O

But O
even O
to O
help O
Edward B-PERSON

" O
he O
continued O

      | O
somewhat O
anxiously O
, O
" O
you O
must O
not O
be O
tempted O

" O
| 
  | O
He O
was O
interrupted O
by O
the O
appearance O
of O
a O
stranger O
, O
who O
addressing O
him O
courteously O
, O

      | O
apologized O
for O
his O
intrusion O
, O
and O
noticing O
the O
children O

inquired O
if O
both O
were O
his O
. O

  | O
Mr. O

replied O
that O
he O
could O
only O
lay O
claim O

little O
girl O

I O
think O

was O
the O
reply O
  O
and O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O

      | O
to O
her O
astonishment O
, O
received O
an O
affectionate O
embrace O

the O
unknown O

whom O
her O

      | O
mother O

ill O

judged O
words O

taught O
her O
actually O
to O
dread O

Mr. O
Myrvin B-PERSON
gladly O
welcomed O
him O

      | O
and O
, O
in O
the O
interest O
of O
the O
conversation O

followed O

forgot O
the O
lesson O
he O
had O
been O
so O

      | O
anxious O
to O
impress O
upon O
Ellen B-PERSON

Arthur B-PERSON
accompanied O
her O
to O
the B-FAC
garden I-FAC
gate I-FAC
, O
and O
the O
gentlemen O

      | O
soon O
afterward O
entered O
the O
cottage O
together O

Days O
merged O
into O
weeks B-DATE

and O
still O
Mrs. O
Fortescue B-PERSON
lingered O
  O
but O
her O
weakness O
increasing O
so O

      | O
painfully O
from O
alternate O
fever O
and O
exhaustion O
that O
to O
remove O
her O
was O
impossible O
. O
It O
was O
the O

      | O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
that O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
had O
ever O
been O
separated O
from O
her O
children O

and O
there O
were O
many O

      | O
disagreeables O
attendant O
on O
nursing O
a O
beloved O
invalid O
in O
that O
confined O
cottage O

with O
only O

      | O
those O
little O
luxuries O

comforts O

could O
be O
procured O

even O
these O
were O
obtained O
with O

difficulty O

nearest O

twenty B-QUANTITY

, O

not O
a O
selfish O
or O
repining O

thought O
entered O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
's O
mind O
. O
It O
was O
filled O
with O
thankfulness O
, O
not O
only O
that O
she O
was O

      | O
permitted O
thus O
to O
tend O
a O
sister O

whom O
neither O
error O

nor O
absence O
, O
nor O
silence O
could O
estrange O

      | O
from O
her O
heart O
, O
but O
that O
she O
was O
spared O
long O
enough O
for O
her O
gentle O
influence O

enduring O
love O

to O
have O
some O
effect O

      | O
by O

that B-TIME

      | O
no O

That O

in O
conversing O
with O
her O

Mrs. O

perfectly O
natural O

that O
the O

took O

sick O
room O

strong O
enough O

excited O

neither O

Different O

willfully O
as O

the O
suffering O
betrayed O
in O
the O

Mr. O

you O

painfully O

Besides O

you O

still O

the O
doctrine O

about O
the O

      | O
importance O

unloving O

theirs O

the O
moment O

birth O

what O
human O
efforts O
can O
alter O
that O
? O

      | O
Why O
, O
the O
very O
infancy O
of O
my O

different O

happy O

Ellen B-PERSON

peevish O

so O
heavy O

she O
never O
seemed O
even O
to O

I O

spring O

me O

Now O
what O
conduct O
on O
my O
part O
could O
have O
done O
this O
? O
Surely O
I O
was O
justified O
in O
feeling O

      | O
differently O
toward O
such O
opposite O
dispositions O

I O

I O
never O
made O
more O
difference O

greater O
reason O

the O
cold O
exterior O
she O
beheld O

was O

      | O
so O
utterly O
incomprehensible O
, O
so O
opposed O
to O
every O

of O
maternal O
love O

which O
she O
knew O
so O

      | O
well O

that O
she O

not O
in O
utter O
neglect O

She O

      | O
could O
imagine O
that O
Ellen B-PERSON

love O

her O

be O
less O
warm O
than O
Edward B-PERSON

, O
believing O
, O
as O

      | O
she O
did O
, O
that O

must O
call O
for O

affection O
, O
not O
be O
satisfied O
with O
leaving O
all O
to O

      | O
Nature O
  O
but O
if O
it O
were O
not O
love O
that O
dictated O
Ellen B-PERSON

conduct O
, O
it O
was O
strange O
and O
almost O

      | O
unnatural O
, O
and O
so O
unpleasing O
, O
that O
so O
young O
a O
child O
should O
have O
such O
an O
idea O
of O
duty O
. O
But O

      | O
these O
were O
only O
passing O
thoughts O
  O
cost O
what O
trouble O
it O
might O

Mrs. O

determined O
she O

      | O
would O
understand O
her O
niece O
as O
she O
did O
her O
own O
children O
. O
|

But O
though O
to O
her O
Ellen B-PERSON
was O
a O
riddle O
, O
to O
her O
sister O
Nature B-WORK_OF_ART
was O
resuming O
her O
sway O
, O
too O
late O
, O
|
      | O
alas O
! O
for O
all O
, O
save O
the O
mother O
's O
own O
reproaches O
. O
Her O
weakness O
had O
become O
such O
that B-DATE
days I-DATE
would O
|
      | O
pass O
when O
speech O
, O
save O
a O
few O
whispered O
words O
, O
was O
impossible O
  O
but O
she O
would O
gaze O
upon O
her O
|
      | O
child O
, O
as B-TIME
hour I-TIME
after I-TIME
hour I-TIME
she O
would O
sit O
by O
the O
bed O
, O
resisting O
all O
Edward B-PERSON
's O
entreaties O
, O
and O
|
      | O
sometimes O
even O
her O
aunt O
's O
to O
go O
and O
play O
, O
and O
long O
to O
fold O
her O
to O
her O
heart O
, O
and O
confess O
she O
|
      | O
had O
been O
cruelly O
unjust O
, O
and O
that O
she O
did O
love O
her O
now O
almost O
as O
much O
as O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
but O
she O
was O
|
      | O
much O
too O
weak O
to O
do O
more O
than O
feel O
. O
And O
Ellen B-PERSON
remained O
unconscious O
of O
the O
change O
, O
except O
that O
|
      | O
now O
and O
then O
, O
as O
she O
would O
bring O
her O
nourishment O
or O
bend O
over O
to O
bathe O
her O
forehead O
, O
her O
|
      | O
mother O
would O
, O
as O
if O
involuntarily O
, O
kiss O
her O
cheek O
and O
murmur O
some O
caressing O
word O
. O
And O
Ellen B-PERSON
|
      | O
longed O
to O
cling O
to O
her O
neck O
and O
say O
how O
much O
she O
loved O
her O
, O
but O
she O
did O
not O
dare O
and O
she O
would O
|
      | O
hurry O
out O
of O
the O
room O
to O
conceal O
her O
tears O
, O
instead O
of O
returning O
the O
caress O
, O
thus O
unhappily O
|
      | O
confirming O
the O
idea O
of O
natural O
coldness O
. O
| 
  | O
Even O
the O
comfort O
of O
sitting O
by O
her O
mother O
was O
at O
length O
denied O
her O
. O
Mrs. O
Fortescue B-PERSON
became O
so O
|
      | O
alarmingly O
and O
painfully O
ill O
, O
that O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
felt O
it O
an O
unnecessary O
trial O
for O
her O
children O
|
      | O
to O
witness O
it O
, O
especially O
as O
they O
could O
be O
no O
comfort O
to O
her O
, O
for O
she O
did O
not O
know O
them O
. O
The O
|
      | O
evening O
of O
the B-DATE
fourth I-DATE
day I-DATE
she O
recovered O
sufficiently O
to O
partake O
of O
the O
sacrament O
with O
her O
|
      | O
sister O
and O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
and O
then O
entreat O
that O
her O
children O
might O
be O
brought O
to O
her O
. O
She O
felt O
|
      | O
herself O
, O
what O
the O
physician O
had O
imparted O
to O
her O
sister O
, O
that O
the O
recovery O
of O
her O
senses O
would O
|
      | O
in O
all O
human O
probability O
be O
followed O
in O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
hours I-TIME
by O
death O
, O
and O
her O
last O
thoughts O
were O
on O
|
      | O
them O
. O
| 
  | O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
full O
of O
glee O
at O
being O
permitted O
to O
see O
her O
again O
, O
bounded O
joyfully O
into O
the O
room O
, O
|
      | O
but O
the O
fearful O
change O
in O
that O
beloved O
face O
so O
startled O
and O
terrified O
him O
, O
that O
he O
uttered O
a O
|
      | O
loud O
cry O
, O
and O
throwing O
himself O
beside O
her O
, O
sobbed O
upon O
her O
bosom O
. O
Mrs. O
Fortescue B-PERSON
was O
fearfully O
|
      | O
agitated O
, O
but O
she O
conjured O
her O
sister O
not O
to O
take O
him O
from O
her O
, O
and O
her O
heavy O
eyes O
wandered O
|
      | O
painfully O
round O
the O
room O
in O
search O
of O
Ellen B-PERSON
. O

" O

she O

in O
a O
voice O
that O

      | O
Ellen B-PERSON
never O
in O
her O
life O
forgot O

she O
clung O

her O
in O
silent O
agony O

lay O
for O
several B-TIME

in O
passionate O
grief O

refused O

Ellen B-PERSON
, O
almost O
unconsciously O
, O

      | O
sunk O
on O

a O
voice O
which O
was O

      | O
scarcely O
audible O

uttered O
at O
long O

only O

the O
cold O

his O

recalled O

      | O
his O

poor O
Ellen B-PERSON
felt O
that O

she O
was O

naturally O

on O

on O

      | O
every O

of O

on O
Mr. O

assurance O
that O

  O
the O

Edward B-PERSON
returned O

again O

again O
, O

each O

with O
the O

determination O

keep O

solemnly O

was O

      | O
not O
for O
her O

sake O
alone O

connected O
only O
with O
her O
  O
perhaps O
, O
had O
it O
not O
been O
for O
the O

      | O
careful O
instructions O
of O
her O
father O
, O
whom O
, O
as O
we O
shall O
presently O
see O
, O
she O
had O
cause O
almost O
to O

      | O
idolize O
, O
Ellen B-PERSON
might O
have O
become O
indifferent O
to O

envious O
of O

But O
his O

      | O
repeated O
instructions O
, O
under O
all O
circumstances O
to O
love O
, O
cherish O
, O
and O
obey O
her O
mother O
had O
been O

      | O
indelibly O
engraved O
, O
and O
heightened O
natural O
feeling O

believed O
that O
to O
keep O
the O
promise O
, O
|
      | O
which O
had O
so O
evidently O
pleased O
her O
mother O
, O
would O
be O
also O
obeying O
her O
father O
, O
and O
this O
double O
|
      | O
incentive O
gave O
it O
a O
weight O
and O
consequence O
, O
which O
, O
could O
Mrs. O

have O
known O

would O

      | O
have O
caused O
her O
great O
anxiety O

urged O
its O
removal O

But O
Ellen B-PERSON
had O
been O
too O
long O
accustomed O
|
      | O
to O
hide O
every O
thought O
and O
feeling O
to O
betray O
that O
which O
, O
child O
as O
she O
was O
, O
she O
believed O
sacred O
|
      | O
between O
herself O
and O
her O
mother O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
watched O
her O
in O
silence O
, O
and O
trusted O
to O
time O
and O
|
      | O
care O
to O
do O
their O
work O
  O

by O
enabling O
her O

understand O

it O

The O
morning O
of O

bright O

sunny O

and O
before O

Ellen B-PERSON

the O
churchyard O

      | O
She O
sat O
there O
thinking O
so O
intently O
, O
that O
she O
did O
not O
know O
how O
time O
passed O

she O

that O

from O
the O
injudicious O

the O

culpable O
negligence O

dislike O

Eleanor B-PERSON
afterward O
displayed O
toward O

      | O
originating O
in O
the O
fancy O
that O
Mrs. O

unjust O

and O
Emmeline B-PERSON
was O
her O
favorite O
. O
Lord O

      | O
Delmont B-GPE
was O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
those O
unfortunately O
weak O
, O
irresolute O
characters O
, O
that O
only O
behold O
the O

are O
therefore O
utterly O
incapable O

acting O
either O
with O
vigor O

      | O
judgment O

When O
he O
did O
venture O
into O
the O
precincts O
of O
his O
daughters O

, O
he O
generally O

      | O
found O
Eleanor B-PERSON
in O
sobs O

tears O
, O
and O
Emmeline B-ORG
quietly O
pursuing O
her O
daily B-DATE
duties O
. O
That O
Mrs. O

      | O
Harcourt B-GPE
often O
entreated O
his O
influence O
with O
her O
younger O

, O
to O
change O
her O
course O
of O

      | O
conduct O

he O
never O
remembered O
longer O
than O
the O
time O
her O
expostulations O
lasted O
. O
Once O
or O
twice O

      | O
indeed O
he O
did O
begin O
to O
speak O
seriously O
, O
but O
Eleanor B-PERSON
would O
throw O
her O
arms O
round O
his O
neck O
and O

      | O
kiss O
him O
, O
call O
him O
every O
endearing O
name O
, O
and O
beg O
him O
not O
to O
look O
so O
much O
like O
grave O
, O
cross O
|
      | O
Mrs. O
Harcourt B-PERSON
, O
or O
she O
should O
think O
she O
had O
indeed O
no O
one O
to O
love O
her O
  O
and O
her O
beautiful O
eyes O

      | O
would O
swell O
with O
tears O
, O
and O
her O
voice O
quiver O
, O
so O
that O
her O
gratified O
father O
would O
forget O
all O
|
      | O
his O
reproof O
, O
and O
give O
her O
some O
indulgence O
to O
make O
up O
for O
the O
injustice O

harshness O
she O

      | O
encountered O
in O
the O

once O
thus O

never O

      | O
resigned O
. O
Her O
father O
's O
appearance O
in O
their O
study O
was O
always O
the O
signal O
for O
her O
tears O
, O
which O

      | O
she O
knew O

confirm O
all O

Mrs. O

unjust O

this O
idea O

Emmeline B-ORG

that O

Lord O

was O
not O
astonished O

delighted O
only O
, O
a O

      | O
feeling O
of O
respect O

his O
gentle O

his O
truthful O
child O

      | O
experienced O
toward O
none O

Emmeline O

indeed O

could O
she O
have O
known O

the O
very O
feeling O
prevented O
the O
display O
of O
that O
|
      | O
caressing O
affection O
he O
still O
lavished O
on O
Eleanor B-PERSON

and O
the O
tears O
of O
his O
elder O
girl O
often O
fell O
|
      | O
thick O
and O
fast O
from O
the O
painful O
longing O
for O
one B-CARDINAL
similar O
caress O
, O
one B-CARDINAL
evidence O
on O
his O
part O
, O

      | O
that O
, O
though O
neither O
so O
beautiful O

nor O
talented O

nor O
engaging O
as O
Eleanor B-PERSON

she O
could O
yet O

minister O

But O
Emmeline O

strong O
feeling O
of O
religion O
, O
while O
it O
enabled O
her O
to O
bear O
up O
against O
care O
and O
|
      | O
the O
constant O
and O
most O
painful O
feeling O
of O
loneliness O
, O
rendered O
the O
trial O
of O
beholding O
her O

      | O
sister O
's O
willful O
course O
of O
error O
, O
if O
possible O
, O
still O
more O
severe O
. O
She O
knew O
that O
all O
her O
|
      | O
affectionate O
counsels O
were O
worse O
than O
useless O
, O
that O
though O
Eleanor B-PERSON

be O
even O
caressingly O

      | O
affectionate O
when O
it O
served O
her O
purpose O

would O
even O
listen O

her O
at O
the O
moment O

suffering O

      | O
from O
some O
too O
hasty O
impulse O
, O
she O
had O
no O
lasting O
influence O

And O
this O
became O
more O
and O
more O

      | O
evident O
as O
Eleanor B-PERSON
became O
the O
almost O

their O

It O
was O
the O
evil O

this O

had O
so O
increased O
Eleanor B-PERSON

at O

With O
a O
calm O

she O
could O
be O
, O
and O
her O
nephew O

      | O
certainly O
a O
pretty O
little O
plague O
. O
Then O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
had O
a O
beautiful O
horse O
entirely O
for O
her O
|
      | O
use O
, O
and O
she O
rode O
exceedingly O
well O
, O
and O
was O
greatly O
admired O
. O
She O
was O
seized O
with O
an O
exploring O
|
      | O
mania O
, O
and O
dragged O
Emmeline O
to O
every O
old O
ruin O
and O
dark O
wood O
within O
ten B-QUANTITY
miles I-QUANTITY
of O
Oakwood B-ORG
. O
|
      | O
Altogether O
the O
impression O
she O
left O
behind O
her O
, O
after O
a O
two B-DATE
months I-DATE
' I-DATE
visit O
, O
was O
such O
as O
to O
ease O
|
      | O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
's O
great O
anxiety O
, O
more O
especially O
as O
it O
appeared O
from O
certain O
private O
|
      | O
conversations O
, O
that O
her O
affections O
were O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
really O
engaged O
, O
and O
Emmeline B-ORG
had O
|
      | O
always O
fondly O
hoped O
that O
when O
that O
should O
be O
the O
case O
, O
Eleanor B-PERSON
would O
become O
a O
very O
different O
|
      | O
person O
. O
Alas O
! O
penetrative O
as O
she O
was O
, O
she O
had O
not O
yet O
learned O
her O
sister O
's O
character O
  O
simply O
|
      | O
because O
utter O
heartlessness O
in O
any O
woman O
she O
could O
not O
comprehend O
. O
| 
  | O
Her O
visit O
to O
her O
father O
in O
London B-GPE
, O
in O
the B-DATE
winter I-DATE
, O
removed O
all O
their O
rising O
hopes O
, O
and O
caused O
|
      | O
such O
increased O
and O
intense O
anxiety O
, O
as O
so O
to O
injure O
her O
already O
delicate O
health O
that O
her O
|
      | O
husband O
bore O
her O
back O
to O
Oakwood B-ORG
a B-DATE
full I-DATE
month I-DATE
before O
they O
had O
originally O
intended O
. O
Whether O
or O
|
      | O
not O
Eleanor B-PERSON
loved O
Lord O
Fitzclair O
, O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
determine O
  O
but O
that O
he O
devotedly O
, O
|
      | O
passionately O
loved O
her O
, O
was O
only O
too O
evident O
, O
not O
only O
to O
the O
world O
, O
but O
to O
herself O
  O
and O
this O
|
      | O
once O
confirmed O
, O
she O
left O
no O
method O
untried O
to O
torment O
, O
and O
so O
, O
as O
she O
declared O
, O
to O
try O
if O
his O
|
      | O
affections O
were O
worth O
having O
. O
He O
was O
half B-CARDINAL
an O
Italian B-NORP
, O
and O
had O
inherited O
all O
the O
strong O
, O
fierce O
|
      | O
passions O
of O
that O
country O
, O
without O
one B-CARDINAL
atom O
of O
self O
- O
control O
. O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
knew O
him O
well O
, O
far O
|
      | O
better O
than O
he O
knew O
himself O
, O
and O
conjured O
him O
to O
withdraw O
from O
the O
society O
of O
one O
who O
could O
|
      | O
never O
make O
him O
happy O
, O
and O
whose O
capricious O
conduct O
was O
so O
likely O
to O
render O
him O
desperate O
and O
|
      | O
miserable O
: O
he O
reasoned O
, O
entreated O
in O
vain O
. O
" O
She O
only O
wants O
to O
try O
the O
strength O
of O
my O
love O
, O
" O
|
      | O
was O
his O
sole O
reply O
  O
" O
and O
were O
she O
to O
torment O
health O
and O
life O
away O
, O
it O
will O
never O
change O
— O
she O
|
      | O
will O
be O
mine O
yet O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
And O
to O
the O
astonishment O
of O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
two B-DATE
months I-DATE
afterward O
he O
proposed O
in O
form O
, O
|
      | O
and O
actually O
was O
accepted O
, O
with O
the O
sole O
condition O
that O
their O
engagement O
should O
be O
kept O
secret O
|
      | O
till O
it O
should O
please O
Eleanor B-PERSON
to O
name O
the B-DATE
wedding I-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
which O
could O
not O
be O
at O
least O
for O
six B-DATE
or I-DATE
|
      | I-DATE
eight I-DATE
months I-DATE
. O
| 
  | O
This O
engagement O
might O
have O
eased O
anxiety O
, O
but O
the O
condition O
increased O
it O
, O
especially O
, O
as O
|
      | O
instead O
of O
coming O
to O
Oakwood B-ORG
, O
as O
Emmeline B-ORG
had O
asked O
and O
hoped O
, O
the O
latter O
part O
of O
the B-DATE
summer I-DATE
|
      | O
and O
autumn O
was O
to O
be O
spent O
in O
Cheltenham B-GPE
with O
a O
very O
gay O
party O
, O
in O
which O
Eleanor B-PERSON
was O
still O
of O
|
      | O
course O
the O
star O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
entered O
the O
nursery O
one O
morning O
earlier O
than O
usual O
, O
for O
her O
|
      | O
infant O
had O
not O
been O
well O
the O
night O
before O
, O
and O
she O
had O
already O
experienced O
the O
care O
as O
well O
as O
|
      | O
the O
joy O
of O
a O
mother O
. O
Her O
babe O
was O
better O
, O
and O
as O
he O
lay O
smilingly O
and O
happily O
in O
her O
lap O
, O
and O
|
      | O
watched O
the O
eager O
movements O
of O
his O
brother O
, O
she O
was O
only O
sensible O
of O
pleasure O
. O
The O
nurse O
had O
|
      | O
arranged O
the O
chairs O
in O
a O
long O
line O
, O
that O
Master O
Percy B-PERSON
might O
, O
with O
their O
help O
, O
walk O
the O
whole O
|
      | O
length O
of O
the O
large O
and O
airy O
room O
. O
The O
feat O
mightily O
pleased O
the O
little O
gentleman O
, O
who O
, O
having O
|
      | O
acquired O
the O
venerable O
age B-DATE
of I-DATE
fifteen I-DATE
months I-DATE
, O
liked O
better O
to O
feel O
his O
feet O
than O
crawl O
on O
the O
|
      | O
floor O
, O
or O
be O
carried O
about O
on O
any O
limbs O
but O
his O
own O
. O
Every O
two B-CARDINAL
or O
three O
paces O
he O
stood O
nearly O
|
      | O
alone O
, O
and O
burst O
into O
a O
loud O
merry O
laugh O
, O
which O
was O
always O
echoed O
by O
a O
crow O
of O
joy O
from O
his O
|
      | O
little O
brother O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Take O
care O
, O
Percy B-PERSON
, O
love O
, O
do O
n't O
fall O
and O
frighten O
mamma O
, O
" O
said O
his O
young O
mother O
, O
who O
was O
|
      | O
watching O
him O
with O
such O
pleasure O
as O
to O
send O
for O
his O
father O
to O
share O
it O
. O
When O
her O
son O
, O
to O
prove O
|
      | O
how O
well O
he O
obeyed O
her O
commands O
to O
take O
care O
, O
stood O
for O
a O
second O
without O
any O
support O
, O
and O
then O
|
      | O
ran O
quite O
alone O
across O
the O
room O
, O
and O
with O
a O
yet O
louder O
laugh O
hid O
his O
rosy O
face O
in O
her O
lap O
. O
|
      | O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
fondly O
kissed O
the O
little O
nestling O
head O
, O
and O
at O
that O
moment O
her O
husband O
entered O
|
      | O
the O
room O
. O
" O
Dearest B-PERSON
Arthur I-PERSON
, O
" O
she O
eagerly O
exclaimed O
, O
" O
I O
was O
actually O
foolish O
enough O
to O
send O
for O
|
      | O
you O
. O
Herbert B-PERSON
seems O
quite O
well O
  O
I O
was O
, O
it O
seems O
, O
needlessly O
alarmed O
, O
and O
Percy B-PERSON
has O
this O
|
      | O
moment O
— O
" O
She O
stopped O
in O
sudden O
terror O
, O
for O
there O
was O
an O
expression O
on O
her O
husband O
's O
|
      | O
countenance O
of O
such O
unusual O
agitation O
, O
that O
though O
he O
tried O
to O
smile O
when O
he O
heard O
her O
words O
, O
|
      | O
she O
could O
not O
conquer O
her O
alarm O
, O
more O
than O
to O
say O
, O
in O
a O
caressing O
voice O
to O
her O
little O
boy O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
Will O
not O
Percy B-PERSON
run O
to O
papa O
, O
and O
ask O
him O
why O
he O
looks O
so O
sad O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
The O
child O
looked O
up O
in O
her O
face O
, O
and O
then O
, O
as O
his O
father O
held O
out O
his O
arms O
to O
him O
, O
let O
go O
|
      | O
his O
mother O
's O
dress O
, O
and O
obeyed O
her O
. O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
caught O
him O
to O
his O
heart O
, O
held O
him O
for O
above O
a O
|
      | O
minute O
, O
kissed O
him O
fondly O
, O
and O
left O
the O
nursery O
without O
uttering O
a O
single O
word O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Let O
me O
take O
Master B-PERSON
Herbert I-PERSON
, O
ma'am O
, O
" O
said O
the O
head O
nurse O
respectfully O
, O
for O
she O
saw O
that O
her O
|
      | O
mistress O
's O
unexpressed O
alarm O
had O
nearly O
overpowered O
her O
  O
and O
in O
a O
few O
minutes O
Emmeline B-PERSON
was O
|
      | O
with O
her O
husband O
, O
whose O
agitation O
was O
so O
excessive O
, O
that O
even O
his O
wife O
's O
presence O
, O
for O
the O
|
      | O
moment O
, O
had O
scarcely O
power O
to O
calm O
him O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
tale O
was O
soon O
told O
. O
Eleanor B-PERSON
's O
conduct O
since O
her O
engagement O
had O
been O
such O
as O
to O
excite O
|
      | O
the O
displeasure O
, O
not O
of O
her O
father O
alone O
, O
but O
actually O
of O
the O
marchioness O
  O
who O
, O
though O
a O
weak O
|
      | O
and O
worldly O
woman O
, O
had O
yet O
some O
idea O
of O
propriety O
. O
As O
a O
near O
relation O
of O
Lord O
Delmont B-GPE
, O
|
      | O
Eleanor B-PERSON
's O
engagement O
with O
Lord O
Fitzclair O
was O
of O
course O
told O
to O
her O
, O
and O
again O
and O
again O
she O
|
      | O
warned O
her O
that O
she O
was O
going O
too O
far O
, O
and O
might O
lose O
her O
lover O
before O
she O
was O
aware O
of O
it O
  O

      | O
but O
Eleanor B-PERSON
only O
laughed O
at O
her O
, O
and O
at O
last O
won O
her O
over O
to O
the O
belief O
that O
it O
was O
certainly O

      | O
better O
to O
cure O
Fitzclair B-ORG
of O
his O
jealous O

before O

marriage O

Lord O

Delmont B-GPE
's O
reproofs O
she O
was O
wo O
nt O
to O
silence O
, O
by O
invariably O
making O
them O
the O
signal O
of O
mortifying O

      | O
and O
annoying O
Lord O
Fitzclair O
still O
more O
than O
usual O
. O
Yet O
still O
at O
times O
she O
relented O
, O
and O
so O
|
      | O
strengthened O
the O
love O
she O
had O
excited O
, O
so O
enhanced O
her O
own O
fascinations O

that O
all O
the O
agony O

an O
incomprehensible O
contradiction O

his O
actual O
right O
the O

it O

      | O
that O

it O

was O
easy O
for O

his O
rival O
  O
but O
|
      | O
believing O
himself O
decidedly O
the O
object O
of O
Eleanor B-PERSON

preference O
, O
he O
increased O
his O

, O

      | O
little O
imagining O
the O
storm O

was O
exciting O

the O
more O
fearful O
from O
its O

      | O
Lord O

interfered O
several O
times O
, O
not O
only O
by O
reproaches O
to O
Eleanor B-PERSON
, O
but O
by O
determined O
|
      | O
coldness O
to O
her O
new O
suitor O
. O
Finding O
at O
length O
that O
her O
encouragement O
actually O
neared O

      | O
criminal O
extent O
, O
and O
after O
a O
desperately O
stormy O
interview O
, O
he O
solemnly O
declared O
that O
if O
she O
|
      | O
did O
not O
dismiss O
Captain B-PERSON
Fortescue I-PERSON
at O
once O
, O

would O
shame O
her O
in O
the O
face O
of O
the O
whole O
world O
, O
|
      | O
by O
proclaiming O
her O
engagement O
with O
the O
young O
marquis B-PERSON
. O
Eleanor O
in O
equal O
anger O
, O
declared O
that O
if O

      | O
he O
threatened O
, O
so O
too O
could O
she O
  O
and O
if O
he O
tormented O
her O
any O
more O
she O
would O
prevent O
all O
|
      | O
publication O
of O
her O
engagement O
, O
by O
herself O
snapping O
it O
asunder O
, O
and O
pledging O
her O
faith O
to O
|
      | O
Captain B-ORG
Fortescue I-ORG
. O
This O
was O
too O
much O
even O
for O
Lord O
Delmont B-GPE

Declaring O
if O
she O
did O
so O
, O
a O

      | O
father O
's O
heaviest O
malediction O
should O
fall O
on O
her O
head O
, O
he O
hastily O
left O
her O
  O
and O
Eleanor B-PERSON
very O
|
      | O
composedly O
went O
to O
prepare O
for O
an O
excursion O
on O
horseback O
with O
Fortescue B-ORG
, I-ORG
Fitzclair I-ORG
and O

      | O
others O
. O
| 
  | O
When O
Lord O
Delmont B-GPE
's O
passions O
were O
once O
roused O
, O
even O
his O
ordinarily O
slender O
judgment O
entirely O
|
      | O
forsook O
him O
, O
and O
he O
did O
that O
which O
at O
another O
time O
, O
knowing O
Fitzclair B-ORG
as O
he O
did O
, O
he O
would O
have O
|
      | O
shrunk O
from O
. O
He O
sought O
him O
, O
while O
still O
exasperated O
, O
upbraided O
him O
for O
his O
weakness O
in O
|
      | O
permitting O
Eleanor B-PERSON
's O
unprincipled O
conduct O
, O
and O
warned O
him O
that O
, O
if O
he O
did O
not O
adopt O
some O
|
      | O
strong O
measures O
to O
prevent O
it O
, O
he O
would O
certainly O
lose O
her O
entirely O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
young O
man O
heard O
him O
without O
reply O
  O
but O
his O
face O
grew O
livid O
, O
and O
he O
clenched O
his O
hand O
|
      | O
till O
the O
blood O
started O
from O
the O
nails O
, O
and O
in O
this O
mood O
of O
concentrated O
passion O
joined O
the O
|
      | O
riding O
party O
. O
The O
exercise O
itself O
is O
, O
to O
some O
temperaments O
, O
unusually O
exciting O
, O
and O
the O
|
      | O
determined O
coldness O
of O
Eleanor B-PERSON
to O
himself O
, O
and O
the O
eagerly O
- O
received O
devotion O
of O
Fortescue B-ORG
, O
|
      | O
maddened O
him O
. O
He O
demanded O
an O
interview O
with O
her O
on O
their O
return O
home O
, O
struggled O
to O
speak O
|
      | O
calmly O
, O
expostulated O
, O
and O
, O
finally O
, O
reproached O
. O
Eleanor O
, O
already O
irritated O
  O
and O
, O
beyond O
all O
, O
|
      | O
that O
her O
lover O
, O
in O
general O
so O
obsequious O
and O
humble O
, O
should O
dare O
to O
call O
her O
to O
account O
for O
|
      | O
mere O
amusement O
, O
combined O
with O
the O
recollection O
of O
Captain B-ORG
Fortescue I-ORG
's I-ORG
flattering O
vows O
and O
|
      | O
willing O
homage O
, O
excited O
her O
to O
an O
extent O
of O
which O
she O
was O
herself O
unconscious O
, O
inasmuch O
as O
she O
|
      | O
firmly O
believed O
, O
whatever O
she O
might O
say O
then O
, O
a O
few O
soft O
words O
would O
speedily O
obliterate O
. O
She O
|
      | O
told O
him O
that O
really O
his O
jealous O
temperament O
was O
beyond O
all O
endurance O
  O
that O
he O
certainly O
must O
|
      | O
intend O
her O
to O
despise O
and O
abhor O
him O
  O
and O
that O
the O
contrast O
he O
presented O
to O
Captain B-ORG
Fortescue I-ORG
|
      | O
was O
such O
as O
to O
make O
her O
most O
heartily O
wish O
to O
put O
an O
end O
to O
their O
engagement O
, O
as O
she O
felt O
|
      | O
quite O
sure O
it O
must O
only O
end O
in O
misery O
for O
both O
  O
and O
, O
without O
waiting O
for O
a O
reply O
, O
she O
|
      | O
haughtily O
brushed O
by O
him O
, O
and O
disappeared O
. O
| 
  | O
Of O
the O
extent O
of O
Fitzclair B-ORG
's O
passion O
Eleanor B-PERSON
had O
not O
the O
least O
idea O
, O
and O
this O
is O
saying O
a O
|
      | O
great O
deal O
, O
for O
she O
generally O
exaggerated O
her O
own O
power O
. O
She O
believed O
she O
had O
inflicted O
pain O
, O
|
      | O
but O
not O
as O
much O
as O
he O
deserved O
  O
and O
determined O
that O
she O
would O
torment O
him O
yet O
more O
at O
the O
ball O
|
      | O
that O
evening B-TIME
. O
But O
to O
her O
extreme O
mortification O
, O
he O
did O
not O
appear O
, O
and O
there O
was O
a O
vague O
dread O
|
      | O
on O
her O
spirits O
as O
she O
retired O
for O
the B-TIME
night I-TIME
, O
which O
prevented O
any O
thing O
like O
rest O
. O
His O
absence O
|
      | O
had O
excited O
surprise O
in O
all O
, O
especially O
Lady B-PERSON
Lascelles I-PERSON
, O
who O
knew O
that O
to O
leave O
Eleanor B-PERSON

      | O
entirely O
to O
the O
attentions O
of O
young O
Fortescue B-PERSON
was O
so O
unprecedented O
as O
to O
bode O
no O
good O
. O
But O
the O
|
      | O
wildest O
conjectures O
were O
far O
from O
reality O
. O
The O
very O
next B-TIME
morning I-TIME
all O
Cheltenham B-GPE
was O
thrown O
|
      | O
into O
the O
most O
painful O
excitement O
by O
the O
incomprehensible O
and O
most O
extraordinary O
fact O
of O
the O
|
      | O
suicide O
of O
Lord O
Fitzclair O
  O
by O
what O
occasioned O
, O
plunged O
into O
such O
mystery O
that O
nothing O
but O
|
      | O
sudden O
aberration O
of O
mind O
was O
imagined O
, O
a O
belief O
justified O
by O
the O
very O
peculiar O
temperament O

      | O
and O
manners O
of O
the O
young O
nobleman O
during O
his O
sojourn O
with O

His O
will O

a O
valuable O

with O
a O
few O
lines O
of O
regard O

faithful O

letter O
addressed O
to O
Arthur B-PERSON

Hamilton B-PERSON
, O

were O
the O

awful O
deed O

not O
been O
committed O
without O

as O
that O

To O
believe O
that O

nothing O

with O
his O
miserable O
end O
was O
an O
attempt O

      | O
vain O
and O
hollow O
, O
that O
even O
she O
shrunk O

realize O
it O
  O
remorse O
in O
all O

torturing O

unmitigated O
anguish O

instead O

leading O
her O

      | O
penitence O

and O
thence O
the O
hope O

urged O

course O

For O
three B-DATE

joined O

night I-TIME
of O
her O
arrival O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
requested O
she O
might O
|
      | O
not O
be O
informed O
of O
it O
till O
the O
following O
day O
. O
About B-TIME
half I-TIME
an I-TIME
hour I-TIME
before O
her O
usual O
hour B-TIME
of O
|
      | O
rising O
after O
such O
scenes O
, O
she O
entered O
her O
sister O
's O
room O
. O
All O
around O
her O
lay O
the O
ornaments O
of O
|
      | O
the B-TIME
previous I-TIME
evening I-TIME
, O
looking O
so O
strange O
, O
gaudy O
, O
and O
faded O
in O
the O
darkened O
room O
, O
and O
judged O
by O
|
      | O
the O
calmer B-PERSON
feelings O
of O
the B-TIME
morning I-TIME
. O
A O
sensation O
of O
intense O
depression O
crept O
over O
Emmeline B-ORG
as O
|
      | O
she O
gazed O
, O
increasing O
as O
she O
looked O
on O
the O
face O
of O
the O
sleeper O
, O
which O
, O
divested O
of O
its O
|
      | O
unnatural O
bloom O
, O
looked O
so O
fearfully O
wan O
and O
haggard O
. O
Her O
beautiful O
hair O
lay O
in O
tangled O
masses O
|
      | O
on O
her O
damp O
brow O
, O
and O
as O
Emmeline B-ORG
gently O
tried O
to O
remove O
it O
, O
Eleanor B-PERSON
started O
and O
awoke O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Is O
it O
already O
time O
to O
get O
up O
? O
" O
she O
said O
languidly O
, O
and O
only B-CARDINAL
half I-CARDINAL
unclosing O
her O
eyes O
  O
" O
I O
|
      | O
feel O
as O
if O
I O
had O
not O
slept O
at O
all O
. O
Am O
I O
dreaming O
? O
" O
she O
added O
, O
starting O
up O
, O
" O
or O
have O
I O
slept O
in O
|
      | O
one B-CARDINAL
place O
, O
and O
awoke O
in O
another O
? O
Am O
I O
at O
Oakwood B-ORG
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
No O
, O
dearest O
Eleanor B-PERSON
  O
will O
you O
not O
welcome O
me O
to O
Malvern B-ORG
House I-ORG
? O
" O
| 
  | O
The O
voice O
, O
the O
look O
, O
seemed O
to O
thrill O
through O
her O
  O
her O
temples O
were O
throbbing O
, O
her O
heart O
|
      | O
weighed O
down O
, O
as O
it O
always O
was O
when O
she O
first B-ORDINAL
awoke O
, O
with O
an O
undefinable O
sense O
of O
guilt O
and O
|
      | O
pain O
  O
she O
tried O
to O
be O
cold O
, O
proud O
, O
reserved O
, O
but O
it O
would O
not O
do O
, O
and O
she O
suddenly O
flung O
her O
|
      | O
arms O
round O
her O
sister O
's O
neck O
, O
and O
burst O
into O
agonized O
tears O
. O
| 
  | O
It O
was O
a O
most O
unexpected O
greeting O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
argued O
hopefully O
from O
it O
. O
Alas O
! O
the O
|
      | O
unwonted O
softening O
only O
lasted O
one B-TIME
brief I-TIME
half I-TIME
hour I-TIME
. O
She O
left O
her O
at O
Eleanor B-PERSON
's O
entreaty O
while O
|
      | O
dressing O
, O
and O
when O
she O
returned O
, O
though O
the O
reckless O
girl O
told O
her O
with O
a B-CARDINAL
half I-CARDINAL
smile O
that O
she O
|
      | O
was O
ready O
for O
her O
lecture O
, O
for O
she O
could O
only O
have O
come O
from O
Oakwood B-ORG
to O
give O
her O
one O
  O
and O
that O
|
      | O
however O
severe O
her O
words O
might O
be O
, O
she O
could O
not O
alter O
her O
tone O
, O
that O
must O
be O
kind O
, O
in O
spite O
|
      | O
of O
herself O
. O
Yet O
Emmeline B-ORG
could O
not O
succeed O
in O
convincing O
her O
how O
wrongly O
, O
how O
cruelly O
she O
had O
|
      | O
acted O
. O
Eleanor B-PERSON
would O
persist O
that O
she O
was O
not O
in O
the O
least O
to O
blame O
, O
and O
that O
poor O
Fitzclair B-ORG
's O
|
      | O
fearful O
end O
was O
only O
owing O
to O
his O
own O
violent O
passions O
  O
in O
fact O
, O
that O
he O
must O
have O
been O
out O
of O
|
      | O
his O
mind O
, O
and O
that O
, O
though O
it O
was O
certainly O
very O
dreadful O
, O
she O
had O
perhaps O
escaped O
a O
very O
|
      | O
terrible O
doom O
  O
but O
speak O
as O
she O
might O
, O
Emmeline B-PERSON
was O
not O
deceived O
as O
to O
the O
agony O
she O
was O
|
      | O
actually O
enduring O
. O
Finding O
, O
however O
, O
that O
all O
her O
gentle O
efforts O
were O
useless O
, O
that O
even O
the O
|
      | O
perusal O
of O
Fitzclair B-ORG
's O
brief O
lines O
to O
her O
husband O
— O
which O
Eleanor B-ORG
insisted O
on O
seeing O
, O
and O
in O
|
      | O
which O
he O
deplored O
his O
madness O
in O
not O
having O
followed O
his O
advice O
, O
and O
flown O
from O
her O
presence O
, O
|
      | O
and O
bade O
him O
take O
his O
forgiveness O
to O
her O
, O
and O
say O
, O
that O
the O
means O
he O
had O
adopted O
would O
, O
he O
|
      | O
trusted O
, O
dissolve O
their O
engagement O
to O
her O
satisfaction O
— O
had O
no O
effect O
, O
save O
in O
causing O
her O
to O
|
      | O
turn O
so O
deadly O
pale O
, O
that O
her O
sister O
was O
convinced O
nothing O
but O
an O
almost O
supernatural O
effort O
|
      | O
of O
pride O
preserved O
her O
from O
fainting O
. O
She O
desisted O
  O
hoping O
against O
hope O
that O
Eleanor B-PERSON
would O
yet O
|
      | O
repent O
and O
become O
a O
different O
being O
. O
She O
knew O
harshness O
would O
only O
harden O
, O
and O
so O
she O
tried O
to O
|
      | O
prevail O
on O
her O
father O
to O
treat O
her O
as O
usual O
, O
but O
this O
Lord O
Delmont B-GPE
could O
not O
do O
. O
It O
is O
strange O
|
      | O
how O
often O
we O
find O
those O
parents O
who O
have O
been O
over O
- O
indulgent O
to O
childhood O
, O
unusually O
harsh O
to O
|
      | O
the O
faults O
of O
youth O
. O
Weak O
characters O
, O
also O
, O
when O
driven O
to O
anger O
, O
are O
always O
more O
violent O
than O
|
      | O
firmer O
ones O
  O
and O
, O
certainly O
, O
Eleanor B-PERSON
's O
continued O
haughtiness O
and O
coldness O
, O
as O
if O
she O
were O
the O
|
      | O
injured O
one O
, O
did O
not O
tend O
to O
calm O
him O
. O
| 
  | O
And O
his O
angry O
feelings O
were O
unfortunately O
but O
too O
soon O
aggravated O
by O
a O
proposal O
in O
form O
from O
|
      | O
Captain O
Fortescue O
for O
the O
hand O
of O
Eleanor B-PERSON
. O
Without O
a O
moment O
's O
delay O
he O
dispatched O
a O
decided O
|
      | O
and O
almost O
insulting O
refusal O
to O
the O
young O
soldier O
, O
and O
then O
sought O
his O
daughter O
, O
and O
vented O
on O
|
      | O
her O
the O
anger O
and O
vexation O
which O
overpowered O
him O
, O
upbraiding O
her O
not O
only O
with O
the O
death O
of O
|
      | O
Fitzclair B-ORG
, O
but O
for O
having O
dared O
so O
to O
encourage O
young O
Fortescue B-PERSON
as O
to O
give O
him O
courage O
for O
his O
|
      | O
audacious O
proposal O
. O
To O
his O
astonishment O
, O
he O
was O
heard O
without O
any O
attempt O
at O
reply O
  O
but O
he O
|
      | O
would O
have O
been O
startled O
, O
could O
he O
have O
seen O
the O
pallid O
cheek O
, O
compressed O
lip O
, O
and O
clenched O
|
      | O
hand O
with O
which O
, O
when O
he O
had O
left O
her O
, O
Eleanor B-PERSON
muttered O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
Father O
, O
if O
it O
be O
sin O
to O
leave O
you O
, O
be O
it O
on O
your O
own O
head O

I O
would O
have O
wedded O
with O
your O

      | O
consent O

had O
you O
permitted O
it O
  O
but O
now O
my O
destiny O
is O
fixed O

There O
is O
no O
peace O
in O
England B-GPE

at O
|
      | O
least O
let O
me O
be O
spared O
the O
agony O
of O
breaking O
another O
loving O
heart O

" O
| 
  | O
Nearly B-DATE
three I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
rolled O
on O
, O
and O
Eleanor B-PERSON
's O
extraordinary O
submission O
, O
and O
even O
in O
some O
|
      | O
degree O
withdrawal O
from O
society O
( O
for O
which O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
's O
arrival O
was O
a O
good O
excuse O
) O
, O
caused O
|
      | O
her O
father O
's O
irritation O
against O
her O
almost O
entirely O
to O
subside O
. O
That O
she O
passed O
several B-TIME
hours I-TIME
|
      | O
each O
day O
apart O
from O
her O
sister O
, O
excited O
no O
surprise O
. O
Emmeline O
was O
thankful O
even O
for O
her O
change O
|
      | O
of O
deportment O
, O
but O
nothing O
confidential O
ever O
again O
passed O
between O
them O
. O
That O
reports O
were O
|
      | O
floating O
about O
, O
connecting O
the O
names O
of O
Miss B-PERSON
Manvers I-PERSON
and O
the O
late O
Lord O
Fitzclair O
, O
seemed O
|
      | O
little O
heeded O
by O
Eleanor B-PERSON
, O
though O
they O
caused O
natural O
vexation O
to O
her O
family O
. O
About O
this O
time O
|
      | O
an O
invitation O
arrived O
for O
Eleanor B-PERSON
from O
a O
lady O
of O
rank O
, O
slightly O
known O
to O
her O
father O
, O
and O
|
      | O
living O
ten B-QUANTITY
miles I-QUANTITY
from O
Cheltenham B-GPE
in O
a O
beautiful O
villa O
, O
at O
which O
she O
expected O
a O
select O
party O
of O
|
      | O
fashionables O
to O
ruralize O
for O
a B-DATE
week I-DATE
or O
two B-CARDINAL
. O
There O
was O
nothing O
in O
the O
note O
to O
excite O
the O
dread O
|
      | O
that O
weighed O
on O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
's O
spirits O
, O
as O
Eleanor B-PERSON
carelessly O
threw O
it O
to O
her O
for O
her O
|
      | O
perusal O
, O
but O
she O
would O
not O
express O
it O
, O
as O
Lord O
Delmont O
seemed O
inclined O
that O
Eleanor B-PERSON
should O
|
      | O
accept O
it O
, O
knowing O
that O
the O
lady O
was O
much O
too O
exclusive O
for O
Captain B-ORG
Fortescue I-ORG
to O
join O
her O
|
      | O
guests O
, O
and O
believing O
that O
Eleanor B-PERSON
's O
apparent O
indifference O
to O
the O
visit O
originated O
from O
that O
|
      | O
cause O
. O
Telling O
her O
he O
was O
so O
gratified O
by O
her O
having O
devoted O
so O
many O
evenings O
to O
her O
sister O
, O
|
      | O
he O
added O
, O
she O
had O
his O
full O
consent O
to O
go O
if O
she O
liked O
, O
as O
he O
could O
better O
spare O
her O
than O
when O
|
      | O
Emmeline B-ORG
returned O
to O
Oakwood B-ORG
. O
She O
quietly O
thanked O
him O
, O
but O
evinced O
no O
particular O
pleasure O
. O
| 
  | O
The B-DATE
day I-DATE
before O
her O
intended O
departure O
, O
the O
sisters O
were O
sitting O
together O
, O
and O
little O
Percy B-PERSON
, O
|
      | O
who O
now O
ran O
firmly O
without O
any O
falls O
, O
was O
playing O
about O
the O
room O
. O
He O
had O
already O
displayed O
a O
|
      | O
high O
spirit O
and O
passionate O
temper O
, O
with O
their O
general O
accompaniment O
, O
self O
- O
will O
, O
even O
in O
|
      | O
trifles O
, O
that O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
felt O
would O
render O
her O
task O
a O
trying O
one O
  O
but O
she O
was O
as O
firm O
as O
|
      | O
she O
was O
gentle O
, O
and O
faced O
the O
pain O
of O
contradicting O
her O
darling O
bravely O
: O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
Do O
not O
touch O
that O
, O
Percy B-PERSON
, O
love O
, O
" O
she O
said O
, O
as O
her O
little O
boy O
stretched O
out O
his O
hand O
toward O
|
      | O
a O
beautiful O
but O
fragile O
toy O
, O
that O
stood O
with O
other O
nick O
- O
nacks O
on O
a O
low O
table O
. O
The O
child O
looked O
|
      | O
laughingly O
and O
archly O
toward O
her O
, O
and O
withdrew O
his O
hand O
, O
but O
did O
not O
move O
from O
the O
table O

  | O
" O
Come O
here O
, O
Percy B-PERSON

you O

not O
played O
with O
these O
pretty O
things O
for O
a O
long O
time O
  O
" O
and O
she O
|
      | O
took O
from O
her O
work O
- O
box O
some O
gayly O
colored O
ivory O
balls O
, O
which O
had O
been O
his O
favorite O
playthings O
, O
|
      | O
but O
just O
at O
present O
they O
had O
lost O
their O
charm O
, O
and O
the O
young O
gentleman O
did O
not O
move O
. O
| 
  | O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
knelt O
down O
by O
him O
, O
and O
said O
quietly O
: O
| 
  | O
" O
My O
Percy O
will O
not O
disobey O
mamma O
, O
will O
he O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Me O
want O
that O
  O
" O
he O
replied O
, O
in O
the O
pretty O
coaxing O
tone O
of O
infancy O
  O
and O
he O
twined O
his O
little O
|
      | O
round O
arms O
caressingly O
round O
her O
neck O
. O
| 
  | O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
felt O
very O
much O
tempted O
to O
indulge O
him O
, O
but O
she O
resisted O
it O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
But O
that O
is O
not O
a O
fit O
plaything O
for O
you O
, O
love O
  O
besides O
, O
it O
is O
not O
mine O
, O
and O
we O
must O
not O
|
      | O
touch O
what O
is O
not O
ours O
. O
Come O
and O
see O
if O
we O
can O
not O
find O
something O
just O
as O
pretty O
, O
that O
you O
may O
|
      | O
have O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
And O
after O
some B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
' I-TIME
merry I-TIME
play O
in O
her O
lap O
his O
mother O
hoped O
he O
had O
forgotten O
it O
  O
but O
the O
|
      | O
little O
gentleman O
was O
not O
, O
he O
thought O
, O
to O
be O
so O
governed O
. O
The O
forbidden O
plaything O
was O
quietly O
|
      | O
grasped O
, O
and O
he O
seated O
himself O
on O
the O
ground O
, O
in O
silent O
but O
triumphant O
glee O
. O
| 
  | O
Surprised O
at O
his O
sudden O
silence O
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
looked O
toward O
him O
. O
It O
was O
his O
first B-ORDINAL
act O
of O
|
      | O
decided O
disobedience O
, O
and O
she O
knew O
she O
must O
not O
waver O
. O
Young O
as O
he O
was O
, O
he O
had O
already O
learned O
|
      | O
to O
know O
when O
she O
was O
displeased O
, O
and O
when O
she O
desired O
him O
very O
gravely O
to O
give O
her O
the O
toy O
, O
he O
|
      | O
passionately O
threw O
it O
down O
, O
and O
burst O
into O
a O
violent O
fit O
of O
crying O
. O
His O
nurse O
took O
him O
|
      | O
struggling O
from O
the O
room O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
quietly O
resumed O
her O
work O
  O
but O
there O
was O
such O
an O
|
      | O
expression O
of O
pain O
in O
her O
countenance O
, O
that O
Eleanor B-PERSON
exclaimed O
, O
| 
  | O
" O
Emmeline O
! O
I O
have O
been O
watching O
you O
for O
the B-TIME
last I-TIME
half I-TIME
hour I-TIME
, O
and O
I O
can O
not O
comprehend O
you O
. O
Do O
|
      | O
explain O
yourself O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
will O
if O
I O
can O
  O
" O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
looked O
up O
, O
and O
smiled O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Why O
would O
you O
not O
let O
that O
poor O
little O
Percy B-PERSON
have O
that O
toy O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Because O
it O
would O
have O
been O
encouraging O
his O
touching O
or O
taking O
every O
thing O
he O
sees O
, O
whether O
|
      | O
proper O
for O
him O
or O
not O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
But O
he O
could O
not O
understand O
that O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Not O
now O
, O
perhaps O
  O
but O
I O
wish O
him O
to O
know O
that O
when O
I O
speak O
, O
he O
must O
obey O
me O
. O
It O
is O
, O
I O
|
      | O
think O
, O
a O
mistaken O
doctrine O
, O
that O
we O
ought O
to O
give O
children O
a O
|  | O
reason O
|  | O
for O
all O
we O
desire O
|
      | O
them O
to O
do O
. O
Obedience O
can O
then O
never O
be O
prompt O
, O
as O
it O
ought O
to O
be O
. O
And O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
if O
we O
wait O
|
      | O
until O
they O
are O
old O
enough O
to O
understand O
the O
reasons O
for O
a O
command O
, O
the O
task O
will O
be O
much O
more O
|
      | O
difficult O
, O
from O
the O
ascendency O
which O
willfulness O
may O
already O
have O
obtained O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
But O
then O
why O
were O
you O
so O
cruel O
as O
to O
send O
the O
poor O
child O
up O
- O
stairs O
? O
Was O
it O
not O
enough O
to O
|
      | O
take O
the O
toy O
from O
him O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Not O
quite O
  O
for O
him O
to O
remember O
that O
he O
must O
not O
touch O
it O
again O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
And O
do O
you O
really O
think O
he O
will O
not O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
can O
only O
hope O
so O
, O
Eleanor B-PERSON
  O
but O
I O
must O
not O
be O
disheartened O
if O
he O
do O
. O
He O
is O
an O
infant O
|
      | O
still O
, O
and O
I O
can O
not O
expect O
him O
to O
learn O
such O
a O
difficult O
lesson O
as O
obedience O
in O
one O
, O
two B-CARDINAL
, O
or O
|
      | O
six B-CARDINAL
lessons O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
And O
will O
he O
love O
you O
as O
much O
as O
if O
you O
had O
given O
it O
to O
him O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Not O
at O
the O
moment O
, O
perhaps O
, O
but O
when O
he O
is O
older O
he O
will O
love O
me O
more O
. O
And O
it O
is O
that O
hope O
|
      | O
which O
reconciles O
me O
to O
the O
pain O
which O
refusing O
to O
indulge O
him O
costs O
me O
now O
. O
" O

  | O
" O
And O
voluntarily O
you O
will O
bear O
the O
pain O
which O
had O
almost O
brought O
tears O
into O
the O
eyes O
of O
the O

      | O
severe O
and O
stoical O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
! O
" O
exclaimed O
Eleanor B-PERSON
. O

  | O
" O
It O
was O
a O
foolish O
weakness O
, O
my O
dear O
Eleanor B-PERSON

for O
which O
my O
husband O
would O
have O
chidden O
me O

      | O
there O
must O
be O
pain O
to O
a O
mother O
if O
called O
upon O
to O
exert O
authority O
, O
when O
inclination O
so O
strongly O

      | O
points O
to O
indulgence O

" O

ever O
I O
have O
any O
thing O

I O
certainly O
shall O

      | O
particular O
as O
you O
are O

Emmeline B-PERSON

what O
harm O

myself O

      | O
Percy B-PERSON

you O

strength O

of O

" O
| 
  | O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
spoke O
impressively O
, O
and O
something O
, O
either O
in O
her O
words O
or O
tone O
, O
caused O
the O
|
      | O
blood O
to O
rush O
into O
Eleanor B-PERSON
's O
cheeks O
, O
and O
she O
hastily O
walked O
to O
the O
window O
  O
then O
, O
as O
abruptly O
|
      | O
returning O
, O
she O
kissed O
her O
sister O
, O
a O
very O
rare O
token O
of O
affection O
, O
and O
declaring O
she O
was O
much O
|
      | O
too O
good O
for O
her O
to O
understand O
, O
quitted O
the O
room O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
following O
day O
, O
dressed O
for O
her O
visit O
, O
and O
only O
waiting O
for O
the O
carriage O
, O
Eleanor B-PERSON
, O
|
      | O
accompanied O
by O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
and O
her O
little O
boys O
, O
entered O
the O
same O
apartment O
. O
Though O
not O
in O
|
      | O
general O
fond O
of O
nursing O
, O
Eleanor B-PERSON
had O
taken O
Herbert B-PERSON
in O
her O
arms O
, O
and O
was O
playing O
with O
him O
with O
|
      | O
unusual O
fondness O
  O
Percy B-PERSON
, O
who O

the O
tempting O
plaything O

his O
banishment O
the O

      | O
preceding O
day O

the O
moment O
his O
eye O
caught O
it O
, O
to O
the O
astonishment O
of O
Eleanor B-PERSON
, O
ran O
up O
to O
his O

      | O
mother O

lisping O
, O
" O
Me O
no O
touch O
that O

Percy O
good O
boy O
now O

" O
held O
up O
his O
little O
face O
lovingly O

      | O
to O
hers O
, O
and O
with O
a O
very O
pardonable O
feeling O
of O
delight O
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
lifted O
him O
up O
and O

      | O
covered O
him O
with O
kisses O

The O
feelings O
which O
thrilled O
through O
Eleanor B-PERSON
at O
that O
moment O
she O
might O
|
      | O
indeed O
have O
found O
it O
difficult O
to O
explain O
, O
but O
she O
was O
so O
conscious O
of O
a O
change O
of O
countenance O
|
      | O
as O
to O
hide O
her O
face O
on O
Herbert B-PERSON

head O

It O
might O
have O
been O
obedience O

disobedience O
brought O

      | O
so O
suddenly O
and O
strangely O
in O
contrast O
— O
and O
who O
were O
the O
actors O
? O
an O
infant O
and O
herself O
. O
For O
a O
|
      | O
minute O
she O
recovered O
, O
stricken O
with O
sudden O
and O
agonized O
remorse O
  O
but O
it O
was O
too O
late O
, O
she O
had O
|
      | O
gone O
too O
far O
, O
and O
the O
announcement O
of O
the O
carriage O
was O
a O
relief O
from O
that O
bitter O
moment O
of O
|
      | O
painful O
indecision O
. O
Placing O
her O
baby O
nephew O
in O
his O
nurse O
's O
arms O
, O
she O
said O
, O
caressingly O
, O
" O

not O
Percy B-PERSON

Lina O
some O
of O
those O
kisses O

well O
as O
mamma O

The O
child O
threw O
one B-CARDINAL
little O
arm O

      | O
round O
her O
neck O
, O
and O
the O
other O
round O
that O
of O
his O
mother O
, O
and O
then O
burst O
into O
a O
merry O
laugh O
at O
|
      | O
thus O
seeing O
himself O
as O
it O
were O
a O
link O
between O
them O
. O
Never O
had O
it O
seemed O
to O
Eleanor B-PERSON
that O
she O
|
      | O
had O
loved O
and O
admired O
her O
sister O
as O
she O
did O
at O
that O
moment O
  O
all O
the O
neglect O
, O
unkindness O
, O
she O
|
      | O
had O
shown O
her O
, O
all O
the O
sarcasm O
and O
satire O
, O
of O
which O
, O
either O
before O
or O
behind O
her O
, O
she O
had O
so O
|
      | O
often O
made O
her O
the O
victim O
, O
combined O
with O
an O
intense O
, O
but O
how O
painfully O
vain O
longing O
to O
have O

      | O
resembled O
her O
in O
the O
remotest O
degree O
, O
rather O
than O
be O
the O
character O
which O
had O
never O
before O

      | O
appeared O
so O
degraded O
, O
so O
hateful O

almost O
overpowered O
her O

a O
convulsive O
sob O
escaped O
her O
as O
she O

      | O
clasped O
Emmeline B-PRODUCT

a O
close O
embrace O

warmth O

off O

  | O
From O
the O
moment O
Arthur B-PERSON
Hamilton I-PERSON
returned O
to O
Cheltenham B-GPE
with O
the O
painful O
intelligence O
that O
he O
|
      | O
had O
arrived O
at O
Leith B-GPE
only O
in O
time O
to O
witness O
the O
departure O
of O
the O
beautiful O
vessel O
which O
|
      | O
contained O
Captain B-ORG
Fortescue I-ORG
and O
the O
exquisitely O
lovely O
bride O
who O
had O
, O
it O
seemed O
, O
turned O
the O
|
      | O
heads O
of O
all O
the O
usually O
quiet O
Scotsmen B-GPE
who O
had O
seen O
her O
, O
Lord O
Delmont B-GPE
gradually O
sunk O
. O
The O
|
      | O
agony O
of O
losing O
her O
forever O
— O
for O
so O
he O
regarded O
her O
departure O
for O
, O
and O
residence O
in O
India B-GPE
for O
|
      | O
an O
indeterminate O
time O
— O
conquered O
every O
other O
feeling O
. O
Her O
conduct O
had O
caused O
emotions O
of O
|
      | O
anguish O
far O
too O
deep O
for O
the O
relieving O
sensation O
of O
anger O
. O
The O
name O
of O
the O
lady O
from O
whose O
|
      | O
house O
and O
by O
whose O
connivance O
she O
had O
eloped O
, O
he O
was O
never O
heard O
to O
breathe O
  O
but O
, O
if O
ever O
|
      | O
casually O
mentioned O
before O
him O
, O
every O
feature O
would O
become O
convulsed O
, O
and O
he O
would O
instantly O
|
      | O
leave O
the O
room O
. O
Often O
and O
often O
he O
accused O
his O
own O
harshness O
as O
the O
cause O
of O
driving O
her O
from O
|
      | O
him O
, O
and O
then O
came O
, O
with O
overwhelming O
bitterness O
, O
the O
thought O
that O
if O
he O
lately O
had O
been O
|
      | O
harsh O
, O
surely O
the O
recollection O
of O
all O
the O
indulgent O
fondness O
he O
had O
shown O
demanded O
some O
|
      | O
gratitude O
in O
return O
. O
If O
she O
had O
but O
written O
, O
had O
but O
expressed O
one O
wish O
for O
his O
continued O
|
      | O
love O
, O
one B-CARDINAL
regret O
for O
his O
present O
pain O
! O
But O
no O
letter O
came O
, O
and O
the O
contending O
but O
|
      | O
all O
- O
depressing O
emotions O
so O
completely O
undermined O
a O
constitution O
never O
very O
strong O
, O
and O
already O
|
      | O
worn O
by O
care O
, O
that O
when O
another O
and O
still O
heavier O
trial O
came O
, O
he O
sunk O
at O
once O
beneath O
it O
. O

  | O
Though O
Eleanor O
had O
been O
his O
favorite O
, O
his O
feelings O
of O
pride O

in O
a O

Mrs. O

The O
pain O

attendant O
on O
Eleanor B-PERSON

and O
the O
dread O
of O

      | O
its O
effects O
on O
Lord O
Delmont B-GPE
, O
had O
for O
two B-DATE
or I-DATE
three I-DATE
months I-DATE
been O
the O
sole O
subject O
of O
thought O
  O
but O
|
      | O
at O
length O
, O
and O
, O
like O
a O
fearful O
flash O
bringing O
a O
new O
sorrow O
to O
light O
, O
it O
pressed O
upon O
them O
that O

      | O
it O
was O
long O
after O
the O
period O
that O
intelligence O
of O
Charles B-PERSON
ought O
to O
have O
been O
received O
. O
Still O

      | O
hoping O
against O
hope O
, O
not O
only O
the O
Delmont B-GPE
family O

but O
all O
who O
had O
friends O
and O
relatives O
on O
|
      | O
board O
the O
Leander B-PERSON
, O
imagined O
that O
she O
might O
have O
drifted O
from O
her O
course O
, O
or O
been O
engaged O
on O
|
      | O
some O
secret O
and O
distant O
expedition O
, O
but O
that O
intelligence O
concerning O
her O
would O
and O
must O
soon O
|
      | O
come O
. O
Alas O
! O
after O
months B-DATE
of O
agonizing O
suspense O
, O
information O
was O
received O
that O
several O
planks O

      | O
and O
masts O
, O
bearing O
evidence O
of O
fire O
as O
well O
as O
water O
, O
and O
some O
sea O
- O
chests O
, O
bearing O
names O
, O
only O
|
      | O
too O
soon O
recognized O
as O
those O
of O
some O
of O
the O
Leander B-PERSON
's O
crew O
, O
had O
been O
cast O
off O
the O
coast O
of O

      | O
Barbary B-PERSON
, O
and O
there O
could O
be O
no O
more O
doubt O
that O
death O
or O
slavery O
— O
that O
fearful O
slavery O
which O
the O
|
      | O
bombardment O
of O
Algiers B-GPE
had O
so O
displayed O
to O
European B-NORP
eyes O
— O
was O
the O
portion O
of O
all O
those O
beloved O

      | O
ones O
, O
for O
whom O
so O
many O
aching O
hearts O
and O
eyes O
had O
watched O
and O
wept O
in O
vain O
. O
It O
was O
a O
trial O
so O
|
      | O
terrible O
that O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
felt O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
as O
if O
even O
submission O
had O
departed O
from O
her O
  O
and O
she O
|
      | O
could O
almost O
have O
rebelled O
in O
spirit O
against O
the O
inscrutable O
decree O
, O
that O
had O
consigned O
one O
so O
|
      | O
free O
from O
vice O
and O
evil O
, O
so O
full O
of O
happiness O
and O
worth O
, O
to O
a O
doom O
so O
terrible O
. O
Much O
as O
she O
|
      | O
had O
loved O
and O
reverenced O
her O
husband O
before O
, O
she O
seemed O
never O
to O
have O
felt O
his O
worth O
and O
|
      | O
tenderness O
till O
then O
. O
It O
was O
his O
sympathy O
, O
his O
strength O
, O
that O
recalled O
her O
to O
a O
sense O
of O
her O
|
      | O
duty O
, O
and O
gave O
her O
power O
to O
endure O
, O
by O
a O
realization O
once O
more O
of O
that O
submissiveness O
to O
a O

      | O
Father O

will O

which O
had O
never O

failed O
her O

But O
time O
, O
though O
it O
softened O
the O
first B-ORDINAL

      | O
anguish O
, O
had O
no O
power O
over O
the O
memories O

this O

not O
even O
when O
the O
increasing O
cares O

      | O

joys O
of O
maternity O
so O
fully O

that O
the O
present O

the O

her O
children O

      | O
appeared O

banished O
all O

Lord O

Mrs. O

not O

rejoiced O

      | O
felt O
gratefully O
thankful O

little O
likely O

absolutely O

this O

The O

by O
Mr. O

the O
startling O

      | O
intelligence O
that O
she O
was O
a O
widow O

dying O

unable O

Oakwood B-ORG

where O
she O

The O

the O

guardedly O
that O

for O
the O

Yet O
still O
he O
loved O

with O
all O
the O
fascinating O
playfulness O
of O
her O

      | O
former O

that O
if O

her O
surrounded O

as O
she O
knew O
she O

by O

devote O

herself O
to O
him O

indeed O
she O
could O
not O

cruel O

indeed O
to O
chain O

the O
exertion O
( O
for O

little O
fitted O

kind O

little O
did O

think O
the O

Eleanor B-PERSON

The O
recollection O

at O
such O
times O

fearfully O

that O
the O
very O
agony O

fearful O

would O

      | O
return O
in O
all O
its O
intensity O
  O
the O
thought O
: O
Had O
her O
father O
really O
cursed O
her O
for O
her O
|
      | O
disobedience O
, O
and O
was O
it O
that O
forever O
hovering O
round O
her O

preventing O
any O
thing O
like O
lasting O

      | O
happiness O

And O
yet O
, O
by O
a O
strange O
contradiction O
, O
while O
the O
idea O
of O
her O
father O
's O
curse O
shook O
her O
|
      | O
whole O
frame O
at O
times O
with O
convulsive O
sobs O
, O
pride O
, O
that O
most O
fatal O
ingredient O
of O
her O
character O
, O
|
      | O
utterly O
prevented O
all O
attempt O
on O
her O
part O
to O
communicate O
with O
her O
relations O

She O
said O

made O
no O

not O

yet O
the O
longing O
for O
Emmeline B-PRODUCT

heartless O

terrible O
struggle O

the O

so O

      | O
much O
power O
as O
to O
make O

by O
the O

that O

Eleanor B-ORG

In O
vain O
did O
the O
colonel O

when O
he O
became O
aware O
of O
this O
treatment O

remonstrate O
that O
it O
was O
the O

      | O
illness O
of O
the O
poor O
child O
— O
neither O
obstinacy O

temper O
: O
his O
wife O
would O
not O
understand O
him O
, O

      | O
and O
at O
length O
he O
sternly O
and O
peremptorily O
declared O
, O
that O
as O
she O
had O
her O
will O
with O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
he O
|
      | O
would O
have O
his O
with O
Ellen B-PERSON

and O
that O
no O
chastisement O
should O
be O
inflicted O
. O
If O
she O
did O
wrong O
, O
he O
|
      | O
was O
to O
be O
told O
of O
it O
, O
and O
if O
necessary O
he O
would O
reprove O
her O
, O
but O
he O
would O
allow O
no O
other O
|
      | O
interference O
. O
Mrs. O
Fortescue B-PERSON
made O
not O
the O
least O
objection O
, O
believing O
that O
as O
her O
husband O
had O
|
      | O
thus O
taken O
her O
in O
charge O

she O
was O
exonerated O
from O
all O

left O
her O
entirely O
to O

      | O
him O

| 
  | O
Only O
too O
quickly O
did O
the O
poor O
child O
discover O
that O
the O
lovely O
being O
whom O
she O
called O
mother O

whom O
she O

Repeated O
punishment O

it O

      | O
had O
only O
extended O
to O
her B-DATE
fifth I-DATE
year I-DATE
, O
had O
completely O
crushed O
the O
gentle O
, O
tender O
spirit O
, O
that O
|
      | O
had O
required O
such O
judicious O
nursing O
  O
and O
combined O
with O
physical O
suffering O
, O
instead O
of O
|
      | O
deadening O
the O
feelings O
, O
as O
in O
some O
dispositions O
it O
would O
have O
done O
, O
had O
rendered O
them O
morbidly O
|
      | O
acute O
— O
an O
effect O
which O
constant O
loneliness O
naturally O
deepened O
. O
Her O
father O
's O
love O
and O
caresses O
|
      | O
had O
caused O
her O
to O
cling O
to O
him O
so O
passionately O
, O
that O
every O
word O
he O
said O
, O
every O
request O
he O
made O
|
      | O
her O
, O
was O
treasured O
and O
thought O
upon O
, O
when O
he O
was O
away O
from O
her O
, O
with O
a O
tenacity O
many O
would O

      | O
have O
fancied O
unnatural O
in O
a O
child O

He O
taught O
her O
, O
though O
his O
heart O
often O
bled O
as O
he O
did O
so O

      | O
( O
for O
what O
claim O

inculcate O

      | O
obey O
her O
mother O
in O
all O
things O
  O
that O
if O
she O
did O
so O
, O
she O
would O
be O
as O
happy O
as O
Edward B-PERSON
in O
time O
, O

      | O
and O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
though O
she O
did O
not O
understand O
him O
, O
obeyed O
  O
but O
Colonel O
Fortescue O
little O
imagined O
|
      | O
the O
evil O
which O
was O
accruing O
from O
these O
very O
natural O
lessons O
. O
| 
  | O
Ellen B-PERSON
learned O
to O
believe O
that O
, O
as O
her O
mother O
never O
noticed O
her O
, O
except O
in O
accounts O
of O
anger O
|
      | O
or O
irritation O
, O
it O
must O
be O
her O
own O
fault O
. O
She O
longed O
to O
be O
beautiful O
and O
buoyant O
as O
Edward B-PERSON
  O
and O
|
      | O
that O
she O
was O
neither O
, O
marked O
her O
in O
her O
own O
young O
mind O
as O
so O
inferior O
, O
it O
was O
no O
wonder O
her O
|
      | O
mother O
could O
not O
caress O
or O
love O
her O
. O
Had O
Edward B-PERSON
presumed O
on O
his O
favoritism O
, O
and O
been O
unkind O
or O
|
      | O
neglectful O
, O
she O
might O
, O
perhaps O
, O
have O
envied O
more O
than O
she O
loved O
him O
  O
but O
his O
disposition O
was O
|
      | O
naturally O
so O
noble O
, O
so O
open O
- O
hearted O
, O
so O
generous O
, O
that O
he O
always O
treated O
her O
with O
affection O
, O
|
      | O
and O
would O
share O
with O
her O
his O
playthings O
and O
sweets O
, O
even O
while O
he O
could O
not O
but O
believe O
her O
in O
|
      | O
all O
things O
his O
inferior O
  O
and O
that O
as O
such O
, O
of O
course O
, O
her O
wishes O
could O
never O
cross O
with O
his O
. O
|
      | O
Poor O
child O
, O
she O
scarcely O
knew O
what O
it O
was O
to O
wish O
, O
except O
that O
she O
might O
cling O
to O
her O
mother O
|
      | O
as O
she O
did O
to O
her O
father O
, O
and O
that O
she O
could O
but O
be O
good O
and O
beautiful O
enough O
to O
win O
her O
love O
! O
|
      | O
The O
lesson O
of O
concealment O
of O
every O
feeling O
is O
but O
too O
easily O
and O
too O
early O
learned O
. O
Tears O
do O

      | O
not O
flow O
even O
from O
childhood O

when O
always O
rudely O
checked O

and O
angrily O
reproved O

Affection O
can O

      | O
not O
display O
itself O
unless O
called O
forth O
  O
and O
so O
the O
very O
outward O
seeming O
of O

more O
in O

      | O
a O
parent O

mere O
superficial O
observers O
may O
believe O

Mrs. O
Fortescue B-PERSON
blamed O

disliked O
the O
cold O

with O
Edward B-PERSON

extraordinary O

      | O
quickness O
, O
only O
confirmed O
her O
painful O
conviction O

great O
inferiority O

the O
impossibility O

      | O
of O

That O

not O
have O

      | O
defined O
these O
sensations O

that O

tremble O

      | O
less O

The O
displeasure O
of O
her O
husband O
, O
his O
reproaches O
for O
her O
conduct O
to O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
by O
causing O
some O
|
      | O
degree O
of O
annoyance O

increased O
Mrs. O
Fortescue B-PERSON

feelings O
of O
dislike O

the O
object O
who O
had O

      | O
caused O
it O

and O
this O
was O
soon O
afterward O
heightened O
by O

  | O
A O
malignant O
fever O
broke O
out O
in O
the O
British B-NORP
settlement O
where O
Colonel O
Fortescue B-PERSON
was O
stationed O
  O
|
      | O
his O
wife O
and O
children O
were O
with O
him O
, O
and O
, O
dreadfully O
alarmed O
, O
Eleanor B-PERSON
determined O
to O
remove O
|
      | O
with O
her O
children O
to O
some O
less O
unhealthy O
spot O
. O
The O
colonel O
willingly O
consented O
  O
but O
before O
|
      | O
their O
hasty O
preparations O
were O
concluded O
Ellen B-PRODUCT
sickened O

Alarm O
for O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
however O
, O
so O
|
      | O
engrossed O
the O
mother O
, O
that O
she O
appeared O
incapable O
of O
any O
other O
thought O
. O
In O
vain O
Colonel O
|
      | O
Fortescue O
urged O
that O
his O
son O
would O
be O
safe O
with O
the O
friends O
who O
had O
promised O
to O
take O
charge O
of O
|
      | O
him O
, O
and O
who O
were O
on O
the O
point O
of O
leaving O
the O
city O
  O
that O
there O
were O
none O
on O
whom O
he O
could O
|
      | O
depend O
so O
to O
tend O
the O
little O
sufferer O
as O
not O
to O
require O
a O
guiding O
head O
, O
and O
she O
knew O
how O
|
      | O
impossible O
it O
was O
for O
him O
to O
be O
with O
his O
child O
as O
his O
heart O
prompted O
. O
He O
urged O
, O
entreated O
, O
|
      | O
commanded O
in O
vain O
, O
Mrs. O
Fortescue B-PERSON
was O
inexorable O
. O
She O
declared O
that O
the O
idea O
of O
her O
son O
being O
|
      | O
away O
from O
her O
at O
such O
a O
time O
would O
drive O
her O
mad O
  O
and O
as O
for O
duty O
, O
one B-CARDINAL
child O
demanded O
her O
care O
|
      | O
as O
much O
as O
another O
  O
that O
her O
husband O
might O
not O
care O
about O
thus O
exposing O
her O
to O
infection O
, O
but O
|
      | O
she O
really O
thought O
, O
for O
Edward B-PERSON
's O
sake O
, O
it O
was O
her O
duty O
to O
take O
care O
of O
herself O
. O
It O
might O
be O
|
      | O
nothing O
to O
the O
colonel O
or O
Ellen B-PERSON
whether O
she O
lived O
or O
died O
, O
but O
to O
Edward B-PERSON
it O
was O
a O
great O
deal O
  O
|
      | O
and O
so O
as O
she O
must O
choose O
between O
them O
, O
she O
would O
go O
with O
him O
who O
loved O
her O
best O
, O
and O
who O
|
      | O
would O
be O
miserable O
without O
her O
. O
The O
haughty O
, O
angry O
tone O
with O
which O
she O
spoke O
, O
the O
unjust O
|
      | O
taunt O
, O
roused O
every O
indignant O
feeling O
, O
and O
Colonel B-ORG
Fortescue I-ORG
said O
more O
in O
that O
moment O
of O
|
      | O
irritation O
than O
he O
could O
have O
believed O
possible O
. O
But O
it O
only O
awakened O
the O
cold O
, O
sustaining O
|
      | O
pride O
which O
Eleanor B-PERSON
always O
called O
to O
her O
aid O
when O
conscience O
smote O
her O
, O
and O
she O
departed O
with O
|
      | O
her O
son O
, O
hardening O
every O
better O
feeling O
, O
and O
rousing O
anger O
against O
her O
husband O
and O
child O
to O
|
      | O
conquer O
the O
suffering O
of O
self O
- O
reproach O
. O
But O
when O
many O
miles O
from O
the O
city O
of O
death O
, O
and O
there O
|
      | O
were O
no O
fears O
for O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
anxiety O
and O
wretchedness O
so O
assailed O
her O
, O
that O
pride O
itself O
gave O
|
      | O
way O
. O
To O
communicate O
with O
the O
infected O
city O
was O
difficult O
, O
and O
very O
infrequent O
, O
and O
again O
and O
|
      | O
again O
did O
she O
wish O
that O
she O
had O
remained O
. O
| 
  | O
During O
the O
continuance O
of O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
illness O
her O
father O
's O
anguish O
was O
indeed O
terrible O
. O
Every O
|
      | O
leisure O
moment O
he O
spent O
by O
her O
side O
, O
moistening O
her O
parched O
lips O
, O
bathing O
her O
burning O
|
      | O
forehead O
, O
and O
listening O
to O
the O
plaintive O
accents O
of O
delirium O
with O
an O
acuteness O
of O
suffering O
, O
|
      | O
that O
injured O
his O
own O
health O
more O
than O
he O
had O
the O
least O
idea O
of O
. O
The O
attendants O
were O
really O
|
      | O
both O
kind O
and O
skillful O
, O
but O
the O
colonel O
fancied O
, O
when O
he O
was O
not O
with O
her O
, O
she O
was O
neglected O
, O
|
      | O
and O
in O
still O
greater O
suffering O
  O
and O
the O
struggle O
between O
his O
duties O
and O
his O
child O
was O
almost O
|
      | O
more O
than O
he O
could O
bear O
. O
He O
had O
never O
been O
a O
religious O
man O
— O
never O
known O
what O
it O
was O
to O
pray O
, O
|
      | O
except O
in O
the O
public O
services O
of O
his O
regiment O
, O
but O
now O
prayer O
, O
earnest O
, O
heartfelt O
, O
poured O
from O
|
      | O
him O
, O
and O
the O
thankfulness O
to O
God O
, O
which O
so O
overpowered O
him O
, O
when O
she O
was O
pronounced O
out O
of O
|
      | O
danger O
, O
as O
to O
compel O
him O
to O
weep O
like O
a O
child O
, O
planted O
a O
sense O
of O
a O
Father O
's O
infinite O
love O
and O
|
      | O
infinite O
compassion O
within O
him O
, O
which O
was O
his O
sole O
sustainer O
the O
short O
remainder O
of O
his O
|
      | O
life O
. O
| 
  | O
Eleanor B-PERSON
's O
letters O
, O
few O
as O
they O
were O
, O
had O
in O
some O
degree O
softened O
his O
anger O
toward O
her O
  O
but O
|
      | O
as O
he O
beheld O
the O
ravages O
of O
disease O
on O
his O
poor O
child O
's O
face O
and O
form O
, O
rendering O
her O
still O
|
      | O
less O
attractive O
than O
she O
had O
been O
, O
and O
perceived O
that O
bodily O
weakness O
had O
extended O
to O
her O
|
      | O
mind O
, O
and O
often O
and O
often O
forced O
tears O
from O
her O
eyes O
and O
momentary O
complainings O
, O
he O
trembled O
|
      | O
lest O
Eleanor B-PERSON
should O
find O
still O
more O
to O
dislike O
and O
reprove O
  O
and O
often O
his O
heart O
bled O
as O
Ellen B-PERSON
|
      | O
would O
ask O
with O
tears O
, O
for O
her O
dear O
mamma O
, O
adding O
, O
plaintively O
, O
" O
Mamma O
never O
kisses O
me O
or O
loves O
|
      | O
me O
as O
she O
does O
Edward B-PERSON
  O
but O
I O
like O
to O
be O
near O
her O
, O
and O
look O
at O
her O
dear O
beautiful O
face O
, O
and O
|
      | O
wish O
I O
was O
good O
and O
pretty O
enough O
for O
her O
to O
love O
me O
. O
Why O
does O
she O
never O
come O
to O
me?—and O
why O
|
      | O
may O
I O
not O
go O
to O
her O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
And O
what O
could O
the O
colonel O
reply O
, O
except O
that O
her O
mother O
feared O
Edward B-PERSON
would O
take O
the O
|
      | O
infection O
, O
and O
therefore O
she O
was O
obliged O
to O
go O
with O
him O
to O
some O
place O
of O
safety O
? O
And O
his O
child O
|
      | O
was O
satisfied O
, O
repeating O
so O
fondly O
her O
delight O
that O
her O
dear O
, O
dear O
Edward B-PERSON
had O
been O
saved O
from O
|
      | O
being O
as O
ill O
as O
she O
was O
, O
that O
her O
father O
clasped O
her O
closer O
and O
closer O
to O
his O
heart O
, O
feeling O
|
      | O
the O
intrinsic O
beauty O
of O
a O
disposition O
that O
, O
instead O
of O
repining O
that O
she O
was O
left O
alone O
to O
|
      | O
suffer O
, O
could O
rejoice O
that O
her O
brother O
had O
been O
spared O
. O
| 
  | O
Colonel O
Fortescue O
obtained O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
weeks I-DATE

leave O

that O
he O
might O
take O
his O
child O

side O

      | O
as O
recommended O
, O
ere O
she O
joined O
her O
mother O

And O
alone O
with O
him O
, O
gradually O
regaining O
a O
moderate O

      | O
degree O
of O
strength O
, O
Ellen B-PERSON
was O
very O
happy O
  O
but O
such O
bright O
intervals O
were O
indeed O
few O
and O
far O
|
      | O
between O
. O
There O
was O
no O
change O
in O
her O
mother O
's O
conduct O
toward O
her O
, O
when O
reunited O

Her O
heart O
had O
, O
|
      | O
indeed O
, O
risen O
to O
her O
lips O
as O
she O
again O
beheld O
the O
child O
so O
nearly O
lost O
  O
and O
had O
she O
followed O

      | O
impulse O
, O
she O
would O
have O
clasped O
her O
in O
her O
arms O
and O
wept O
over O
her O
, O
but O
that O
would O
have O
seemed O

      | O
tacitly O
to O
acknowledge O
that O
she O
had O
been O
wrong O

and O
had O
suffered O
from O
it O
  O

so O
she O

refrained O

from O
that O

About B-DATE

after O
Ellen B-PERSON

dangerous O

and O
Edward B-PERSON
just O

      | O
eleven B-CARDINAL
, O
Colonel O
Fortescue B-PERSON
was O
ordered O
to O
take O
command O
of O
some O
troops O
to O
be O
stationed O
at O
a O
|
      | O
fort O
, O
whose O
vicinity O
to O
some O
hostile O
natives O
rendered O
it O
rather O
a O
post O
of O
danger O
. O
The O
wives O
|
      | O
and O
children O
of O
the O
officers O
were O
permitted O
to O
accompany O
them O
, O
if O
they O
wished O
it O
, O
and O
, O
except O

      | O
in O
the O
colonel O

own O
family O
, O
there O
had O
been O
no O
hesitation O
in O
their O
choice O
. O
The O
colonel O
was O
|
      | O
strangely O
and O
painfully O
depressed O
as O
with O
some O
vague O
dread O
, O
and O
all O
his O
affection O
for O
his O
wife O
|
      | O
had O
returned O
with O
such O
force O
as O
to O
make O
him O
shrink O
in O
unusual O
suffering O
from O
the O
idea O
of O
|
      | O
leaving O
her O
  O
and O
conquering O
reluctance O
, O
for O
he O
felt O
as O
if O
she O
would O
not O
accede O
, O
he O
implored O
|
      | O
her O
to O
accompany O
him O
, O
confessing O
he O
felt O
ill O
and O
unhappy O
, O
and O
shrank O
from O
a O
separation O
. O
His O
|
      | O
wife O
looked O
at O
him O
with O
astonishment O
  O
he O
had O
never O
asked O
nor O
thought O
of O
such O
a O
thing O
before O
, O

      | O
she O
said O

in O
their O
many O
brief O
partings O
, O
and O
she O
really O
could O
not O
understand O
him O
. O
The O
place O
was O
|
      | O
decidedly O
unhealthy O
, O
and O
Edward B-PERSON
must O
not O
be O
exposed O
to O
its O
malaria O

promised O
him O
to O
go O
to O
a O
juvenile O
ball O
, O
which O
was O
given O
by O
an O
English B-LANGUAGE
family O
of O
rank O
, O
in O
a O
|
      | O
fortnight O
's O
time O
, O
and O
she O
could O
not O
possibly O
disappoint O
him O
  O
and O
why O
her O
husband O
should O
wish O
|
      | O
for O
her O
in O
such O
a O
place O
she O
could O
not O
imagine O
, O
but O
she O
knew O
she O
should O
die O
of O
terror O
before O
|
      | O
she O
had O
been O
there O
a B-DATE
week I-DATE
. O
Not O
a O
word O
did O
the O
colonel O
utter O
in O
reply O
, O
but O
he O
felt O
as O
if O
an O
|
      | O
ice O
- O
bolt O
had O
struck O
his O
heart O
and O
frozen O
it O
at O
once O
. O
He O
fixed O
his O
eyes O
upon O
her O
, O
with O
a O
|
      | O
strange O
, O
sad O
, O
reproaching O
look O
, O
which O
haunted O
her O
till O
her O
death O
, O
and O
turning O
from O
her O
, O
sought O
|
      | O
the O
room O
where O
Ellen B-PERSON
was O
preparing O
her O
lessons O
for O
the B-TIME
joyful I-TIME
hour I-TIME
when O
he O
could O
attend O
to O
|
      | O
her O
. O
As O
she O
sprung O
toward O
him O
with O
a O
cry O
of O
glee O
, O
he O
clasped O
her O
to O
his O
bosom O
, O
without O
the O
|
      | O
power O
of O
uttering O
a O
sound O
, O
save O
a O
groan O
so O
deep O
and O
hollow O
, O
that O
the O
child O
's O
unusual O
glee O
was O
|
      | O
checked O
, O
and O
she O
clung O
to O
him O
in O
terror O
  O
and O
when O
he O
could O
tell O
her O
that O
he O
was O
about O
to O
leave O
|
      | O
her O
, O
and O
for O
an O
indefinite O
time O
, O
her O
passionate O
grief O
seemed O
almost O
to O
comfort O
him O
, O
by O
its O
|
      | O
strong O
evidence O
of O
her O
childish O
love O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Let O
me O
go O
with O
you O
, O
papa O
, O
dear O
papa O
! O
oh O
! O
I O
will O
be O
so O
good O
— O
I O
will O
not O
give O
you O
any O
trouble O
, O
|
      | O
indeed O
, O
indeed O
I O
will O
not O
. O
Pray O
, O
pray O
, O
take O
me O
with O
you O
, O
dear O
, O
dear O
papa O
? O
" O
And O
she O
looked O
in O
|
      | O
his O
face O
so O
beseechingly O
, O
that O
the O
colonel O
had O
no O
strength O
to O
resist O
, O
and O
fondly O
kissing O
her O
, O
|
      | O
he O
promised O
that O
if O
Mrs. O
Cameron B-PERSON
would O
permit O
her O
to O
join O
her O
little O
family O
, O
she O
should O
go O
|
      | O
with O
him O
: O
and O
, O
to O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
intense O
thankfulness O
, O
the O
permission O
was O
willingly O
accorded O
. O
| 
  | O
Mrs. O
Fortescue B-PERSON
had O
indeed O
replied O
, O
when O
her O
husband O
briefly O
imparted O
his O
intention O
, O
that O
he O
|
      | O
certainly O
must O
intend O
Ellen B-PERSON
to O
be O
ill O
again O
, O
by O
exposing O
her O
to O
such O
an O
unhealthy O
climate O
  O
and O
|
      | O
that O
if O
she O
were O
, O
he O
must O
not O
be O
angry O
if O
she O
refused O
to O
go O
and O
nurse O
her O
, O
as O
it O
would O
be O
all O
|
      | O
his O
weak O
indulgence O
, O
and O
no O
fault O
of O
hers O
. O
The O
colonel O
made O
no O
answer O
, O
and O
irritated O
beyond O
|
      | O
measure O
at O
his O
manner O
, O
Eleanor B-PERSON
parted O
from O
her O
husband O
in O
coldness O
and O
in O
pride O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
fortnight O
passed O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Fortescue B-PERSON
felt O
as O
if O
her O
own O
youth O
were O
indeed O
renewed O
, O
the O
|
      | O
longings O
for O
universal O
admiration O
again O
her O
own O
  O
but O
now O
it O
was O
only O
for O
her O
son O
, O
and O
her O
|
      | O
triumph O
was O
complete O
  O
many O
and O
lovely O
were O
the O
youthful O
beings O
called O
together O
on O
that O
festive O
|
      | O
night B-TIME
, O
seeming O
as O
if O
England B-GPE
had O
concentrated O
her O
fairest O
and O
purest O
offspring O
in O
that O
far O
|
      | O
distant O
land O
  O
but O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
and O
his O
still O
lovely O
mother O
, O
outshone O
them O
all O
. O
That O
she O
was O
herself O
|
      | O
admired O
as O
much O
, O
if O
not O
more O
, O
than O
she O
had O
ever O
been O
in O
her O
palmy O
days B-DATE
of O
triumph O
, O
Eleanor B-PERSON
|
      | O
scarcely O
knew O
  O
her O
every O
feeling O
was O
centered O
in O
her O
boy O
, O
and O
consequently O
the O
supercilious O
|
      | O
haughtiness O
which O
had O
so O
often O
marred O
her O
beauty O
in O
former B-DATE
days I-DATE
was O
entirely O
laid O
aside O
, O
and O
|
      | O
maternal O
pride O
and O
pleasure O
gratified O
to O
the O
utmost O
, O
added O
a O
new O
charm O
to O
her O
every O
movement O
|
      | O
and O
every O
word O
. O
She O
heard O
the O
universal O
burst O
of O
admiration O
which O
greeted O
her O
, O
as O
to O
oblige O
|
      | O
Edward B-PERSON
she O
went O
through O
a O
quadrille O
with O
him O
, O
and O
never O
in O
her O
whole O
career O
had O
she O
felt O
so O
|
      | O
triumphant O
, O
so O
proud O
, O
so O
joyous O
. O
During O
the O
past O
fortnight O
she O
had O
often O
been O
tormented O
by O
|
      | O
self O
- O
reproach O
, O
and O
her O
husband O
's O
look O
had O
disagreeably O
haunted O
her O
  O
but O
this B-TIME
night I-TIME
not O
a O
|
      | O
fleeting O
thought O
of O
either O
the O
colonel O
or O
Ellen B-PERSON
entered O
her O
mind O
, O
and O
her O
pleasure O
was O
|
      | O
complete O
. O
| 
  | O
Tired O
with O
dancing O
, O
and O
rather O
oppressed O
with O
the O
heat O
, O
Eleanor B-PERSON
quitted O
the O
crowded O
|
      | O
ball O
- O
room O
, O
and O
stood O
for O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
quite O
alone O
in O
a O
solitary O
part O
of O
the O
verandah O
, O
which O
, O
|
      | O
covered O
with O
lovely O
flowers O
, O
ran O
round O
the O
house O
. O
The O
music O
in O
the O
ball O
- O
room O
sounded O
in O
the O
|
      | O
distance O
as O
if O
borne O
by O
the O
night O
breeze O
in O
softened O
harmony O
over O
the O
distant O
hills O
. O
The O
moon O
|
      | O
was O
at O
the O
full O
, O
and O
lit O
up O
nearly O
the O
whole O
garden O
with O
the O
refulgence O
of O
a B-DATE
milder I-DATE
day I-DATE
. O
At O
|
      | O
that O
moment O
a O
cold O
chill O
crept O
over O
the O
heart O
and O
frame O
of O
Eleanor B-PERSON
, O
causing O
her O
breath O
to O
come O
|
      | O
thick O
and O
gaspingly O
. O
Why O
, O
she O
knew O
not O
, O
for O
there O
was O
nothing O
visible O
to O
cause O
it O
, O
save O
that O
, O
|
      | O
in O
one B-CARDINAL
part O
of O
the O
garden O
, O
a O
cluster O
of O
dark O
shrubs O
, O
only O
partly O
illuminated O
by O
the O
rays O
of O
|
      | O
the O
moon O
, O
seemed O
suddenly O
to O
have O
assumed O
the O
shape O
of O
a O
funeral O
bier O
, O
covered O
with O
a O
military O
|
      | O
pall O
. O
At O
the O
same O
moment O
the O
music O
in O
the O
ball O
- O
room O
seemed O
changed O
to O
the O
low O
wailing O
plaint O
|
      | O
and O
muffled O
drums O
, O
the O
military O
homage O
to O
some O
mighty O
dead O
. O
And O
if O
it O
were O
indeed O
but O
excited O
|
      | O
fancy O
, O
it O
had O
a O
strange O
effect O
, O
for O
Eleanor B-PERSON
fainted O
on O
the O
marble O
floor O
. O
| 
  | O
That O
same O
afternoon O
Colonel O
Fortescue B-PERSON
, O
with O
some O
picked O
men O
, O
had O
set O
off O
to O
discover O
the O
|
      | O
track O
of O
some O
marauding O
natives O
, O
who O
for O
some B-DATE
days I-DATE
had O
been O
observed O
hovering O
about O
the O
|
      | O
neighborhood O
. O
Military O
ardor O
carried O
him O
farther O
than O
he O
intended O
, O
and O
it O
was O
nearly B-TIME
night I-TIME
, O
|
      | O
when O
entering O
a O
narrow O
defile O
, O
a O
large O
body O
of O
the O
enemy O
burst O
upon O
them O
, O
and O
a O
desperate O
|
      | O
contest O
ensued O
. O
The O
defile O
was O
so O
hemmed O
in O
with O
rock O
and O
mountain O
, O
that O
though O
not O
very O
|
      | O
distant O
from O
the O
fort O
, O
the O
noise O
of O
the O
engagement O
had O
not O
been O
distinguished O
. O
Captain O
Cameron B-PERSON
|
      | O
was O
quietly O
sitting O
with O
his O
wife O
and O
elder O
children O
, O
awaiting O
without O
any O
forebodings O
the O
|
      | O
return O
of O
the O
colonel O
. O
Though O
it O
was O
late O
, O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
fears O
had O
been O
so O
visible O
, O
that O
Mrs. O
|
      | O
Cameron B-ORG
could O
not O
send O
her O
to O
bed O
  O
the O
child O
seemed O
so O
restless O
and O
uneasy O
that O
the O
captain O
|
      | O
had O
tried O
to O
laugh O
her O
out O
of O
her O
cowardice O
, O
as O
he O
called O
it O
, O
declaring O
that O
her O
father O
would O
|
      | O
disown O
her O
if O
she O
could O
not O
be O
more O
brave O
. O
Hasty O
footsteps O
were O
at O
length O
heard O
approaching O
, O
|
      | O
and O
Ellen B-PERSON
started O
from O
her O
seat O
and O
sprung O
forward O
, O
as O
the O
door O
opened O
  O
but O
it O
was O
not O
the O
|
      | O
colonel O
, O
only O
a O
sergeant O
, O
who O
had O
accompanied O
him O
, O
and O
whose O
face O
caused O
Captain B-PERSON
Cameron I-PERSON
to O
|
      | O
exclaim O
, O
in O
alarm O
, O
" O
How O
now O
, O
Sergeant B-PERSON
Allen I-PERSON
, O
returned O
, O
and O
alone O
  O
what O
has O
chanced O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
The O
worst O
those O
brown O
devils O
could O
have O
done O
! O
" O
was O
the O
energetic O
reply O
. O
" O
We O
've O
beaten O
them O
, O
|
      | O
and O
we O
will O
beat O
them O
again O
, O
the O
villains O
! O
but O
that O
will O
not O
bring O

him O

      | O
back O
— O
captain O
— O
captain O
— O
the O
colonel O
's O
down O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
The O
captain O
started O
from O
his O
chair O
, O
but O
before O
he O
could O
frame O
another O
word O
, O
Ellen B-PERSON
had O
caught O
|
      | O
hold O
of O
the O
old O
man O
's O
arm O
, O
and O
wildly O
exclaimed O
, O
" O
Do O
you O
mean O
— O
do O
you O
mean O
, O
pray O
tell O
me O
, O
|
      | O
Sergeant O
Allen!—Have O
the O
natives O
met O
papa O

troop O
, O
and O
have O
they O
fought?—and O
— O
is O
he O
hurt O
— O
is O
he O
|
      | O
killed O
? O
" O
The O
man O
could O
not O
answer O
her O
— O
for O
her O
look O
and O
tone O
, O
he O
afterward O
declared O
to O
his O
|
      | O
comrades O
, O
went O
through O
his O
heart O
, O
just O
for O
all O
the O
world O
like O
a O
saber O
cut O
  O
and O
for O
the O
moment O
|
      | O
neither O
Captain O
nor O
Mrs. O
Cameron B-PERSON
could O
address O
her O
. O
The O
shock O
seemed O
to O
have O
banished O
voice O
|
      | O
from O
all O
, O
save O
from O
the O
poor O
child O
principally O
concerned O
. O

  | O
" O
Stay O
with O
me O
, O
my O
dear O
Ellen B-PERSON
! O
" O
Mrs. O
Cameron B-PERSON
at O
length O
said O
, O
advancing O
to O
her O
, O
as O
she O
stood O
|
      | O
still O
clinging O
to O
the O
sergeant O
's O
arm O
: O
" O
the O

will O
go O

meet O
your O
father O

" O
No O

no O

no O

was O
the O
agonized O
reply O
  O
" O
let O
me O
go O
to O
him O

before O

never O

told O
me O

should O
fall O
in O

      | O
battle O

oh O
! O
Mrs. O
Cameron B-PERSON

pray O

me O
go O

him O

And O
they O
who O
knew O
all O
which O
that O
father O
was O
to O
his O
poor O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
could O
not O
resist O
that O
appeal O
. O

      | O
The O
sergeant O
said O
the O
colonel O
was O
not O
dead O
, O
but O
so O
mortally O
wounded O
they O
feared O
to O
move O
him O
. O
|
      | O
It O
was O
a O
fearful O
scene O
. O
Death O
in O
its O
most O
horrid O
form O
was O
all O
around O
her O
  O
her O
little O
feet O
were O
|
      | O
literally O
deluged O
in O
blood O
, O
and O
she O
frequently O
stumbled O
over O
the O
dusky O
forms O
and O
mangled O
and O
|
      | O
severed O
limbs O
that O
lay O
on O
the O
grass O
, O
but O
neither O
sob O
nor O
cry O
escaped O
her O
till O
she O
beheld O
her O
|
      | O
father O
. O
His O
men O
had O
removed O
him O
from O
the O
immediate O
scene O
of O
slaughter O
, O
and O
tried O
to O
form O
a O
|
      | O
rough O
pallet O
of O
military O
cloaks O
, O
but O
the O
ghastly O
countenance O
, O
which O
the O
moon O
's O
light O
rendered O
|
      | O
still O
more O
fixed O
and O
pallid O
, O
the O
rigidity O
of O
his O
limbs O
, O
all O
seemed O
to O
denote O
they O
had O
indeed O
|
      | O
arrived O
too O
late O
, O
and O
that O
terrible O
stillness O
was O
broken O
by O
the O
convulsed O
and O
passionate O
sobs O
|
      | O
of O
the O
poor O
child O
, O
who O
, O
flinging O
herself O
beside O
him O
, O
besought O
him O
only O
to O
open O
his O
eyes O
, O
to O
|
      | O
look O
upon O
her O
once O
more O
, O
to O
call O
her O
his O
darling O
, O
and O
kiss O
her O
once O
, O
only O
once O
again O
: O
and O
it O
|
      | O
seemed O
as O
if O
her O
voice O
had O
indeed O
power O
to O
recall O
the O
fluttering O
soul O
. O
The O
heavy O
eyes O
did O
|
      | O
unclose O
, O
the O
clenched O
hand O
relaxed O
to O
try O
and O
clasp O
his O
child O
, O
and O
he O
murmured O
feebly O
— O

  | O
" O
How O
came O
you O
here O
, O
my O
poor O
darling O

" O
The O
|
      | O
captain O
knelt O
down O
by O
him O
and O
convulsively O
pressed O
his O
hand O
, O
but O
he O
could O
not O
speak O
. O

" O
God O

my O

my O
poor O
Ellen O

" O
A O
fearful O
convulsion O
choked O
|
      | O
his O
voice O
, O
but O
after O
a O
little O
while O
he O
tried O
to O
speak O
again O
— O

" O

mercy O

      | O
poor O
children O

" O
He O
tried O
to O
press O
his O
lips O
again O
on O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
cheek O
and O
brow O
, O
but O
the O
effort O
was O
|
      | O
vain O
— O
and O
at O
the O
very O
moment O
Mrs. O
Fortescue B-PERSON
had O
stood O
transfixed O
by O
some O
unknown O
terror O
, O
her O
|
      | O
husband O
ceased O
to O
breathe O
. O
| 
  | O
It O
was O
long O
before O
Ellen B-PERSON
rallied O
from O
that O
terrible O
scene O
. O
Even O
when O
the O
fever O
which O
|
      | O
followed O
subsided O
, O
and O
she O
had O
been O
taken O
, O
apparently O
perfectly O
restored O
to O
health O
, O
once O
more O
|
      | O
to O
her O
mother O
and O
brother O
, O
its O
recollection O
so O
haunted O
her O
, O
that O
her O
many O
lonely O
hours B-TIME
became O
|
      | O
fraught O
with O
intense O
suffering O
. O
Her O
imagination O
, O
already O
only O
too O
morbid O
, O
dwelt O
again O
and O
|
      | O
again O
upon O
the O
minutest O
particular O
of O
that O
field O
of O
horror O
  O
not O
only O
her O
father O
, O
but O
the O
|
      | O
objects O
which O
, O
when O
her O
whole O
heart O
was O
wrapped O
in O
him O
, O
she O
seemed O
not O
even O
to O
have O
seen O
. O
The O
|
      | O
ghastly O
heaps O
of O
dead O
, O
the O
severed O
limbs O
, O
the O
mangled O
trunks O
, O
the O
gleaming O
faces O
all O
fixed O
in O
|
      | O
the O
distorted O
expressions O
with O
which O
they O
died O
— O
the O
very O
hollow O
groans O
and O
louder O
cry O
of O
pain O
|
      | O
which O
, O
as O
she O
passed O
through O
the O
field O
, O
had O
fallen O
on O
her O
ear O
unheeded O
, O
returned O
to O
the O
poor O
|
      | O
child O
's O
too O
early O
awakened O
fancy O
so O
vividly O
, O
that O
often O
and O
often O
it O
was O
only O
a O
powerful O
|
      | O
though O
almost O
unconscious O
effort O
that O
prevented O
the O
scream O
of O
fear O
. O
Her O
father O
's O
last O
words O
|
      | O
were O
never O
forgotten O
  O
she O
would O
not O
only O
continue O
to O
love O
her O
mother O
because O
he O
had O
desired O
|
      | O
her O
to O
do O
so O
, O
but O
because O
|  | O
he O
had O
so O
loved O
her O
| | O
, O
and O
on O
her O
first B-ORDINAL
return O
home O
this O
|
      | O
seemed O
easier O
than O
ever O
to O
accomplish O
. O
Mrs. O
Fortescue B-PERSON
, O
tortured O
by O
remorse O
and O
grief O
, O
had O
|
      | O
somewhat O
softened O
toward O
the O
child O
who O
had O
received O
the O
last O
breath O
of O
her O
husband O
  O
and O
could O
|
      | O
Ellen B-PERSON
have O
overcome O
the O
reserve O
and O
fear O
which O
so O
many O
years O
of O
estrangement O
had O
engendered O
, O
|
      | O
and O
given O
vent O
to O
the O
warmth O
of O
her O
nature O
, O
Mrs. O
Fortescue B-PERSON
might O
have O
learned O
to O
know O
, O
and O
|
      | O
knowing O
, O
to O
love O
her O
— O
but O
it O
was O
then O
too O
late O
. O
| 
  | O
So O
torturing O
were O
Mrs. O
Fortescue B-PERSON
's O
feelings O
when O
she O
recalled O
the O
last O
request O
of O
her O
|
      | O
husband O
, O
and O
her O
cruel O
and O
haughty O
refusal O
  O
when O
that O
which O
had O
seemed O
so O
important O
, O
a O
|
      | O
juvenile O
ball O
— O
because O
not O
to O
go O
would O
disappoint O
Edward B-PERSON
— O
became O
associated O
with O
his O
fearful O
|
      | O
death O
, O
and O
sunk O
into O
worse O
than O
nothing O
— O
she O
had O
parted O
with O
him O
in O
anger O
, O
and O
it O
proved O
|
      | O
forever —that O
even O
as O
England B-GPE
had O
become O
odious O
to O
her O
, O
twelve B-DATE
years I-DATE
before O
, O
so O
did O
India B-GPE
now O
  O
|
      | O
and O
she O
suddenly O
resolved O
to O
quit O
it O
, O
and O
return O
to O
the O
relatives O
she O
had O
neglected O
so O
long O
, O
|
      | O
but O
toward O
whom O
she O
now O
yearned O
more O
than O
ever O
. O
She O
thought O
and O
believed O
such O
a O
complete O
|
      | O
change O
would O
and O
must O
bring O
peace O
. O
Alas O
! O
what O
change O
will O
remove O
the O
torture O
of O
remorse O
? O
| 
  | O
Though O
incapable O
of O
real O
love O
, O
from O
her O
studied O
heartlessness O
, O
it O
was O
impossible O
for O
her O
to O
|
      | O
have O
lived O
twelve B-DATE
years I-DATE
with O
one B-CARDINAL
so O
indulgent O
and O
fond O
as O
Colonel O
Fortescue O
, O
without O
realizing O
|
      | O
some O
degree O
of O
affection O
, O
and O
his O
unexpected O
and O
awful O
death O
roused O
every O
previously O
dormant O
|
      | O
feeling O
so O
powerfully O
, O
that O
she O
was O
astonished O
at O
herself O
, O
and O
in O
her O
misery O
believed O
that O
the O
|
      | O
feeling O
had O
only O
come O
, O
to O
add O
to O
her O
burden O
— O
for O
what O
was O
the O
use O
of O
loving O
now O
? O
and O
determined O
|
      | O
to O
rouse O
herself O
, O
she O
made O
every O
preparation O
for O
immediate O
departure O
, O
but O
she O
was O
painfully O
|
      | O
arrested O
. O
The O
selfish O
mother O
had O
fled O
from O
the O
couch O
of O
her O
suffering O
child O
, O
and O
now O
a O

      | O
variation O
of O
the O
same O
complaint O
laid O
her O
on O
a O
bed O
of O
pain O
. O
It O
was O
a O
desperate O
struggle O
between O
|
      | O
life O
and O
death O
  O
but O
she O
rallied O
, O
and O
insisted O
on O
taking O
her O
passage O
for O
England B-GPE
some B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
|
      | O
before O
her O
medical O
attendant O
thought O
it O
advisable O
. O
The O
constant O
struggle O
between O
the O
|
      | O
whisperings O
of O
good O
and O
the O
dominion O
of O
evil O
, O
which O
her O
whole O
life O
had O
been O
, O
had O
unconsciously O
|
      | O
undermined O
a O
constitution O
naturally O
good O
  O
and O
when O
to O
this O
was O
added O
a O
malignant O
disease O
, O
|
      | O
though O
brief O
in O
itself O
, O
the O
seeds O
of O
a O
mortal O
complaint O
were O
planted O
, O
which O
, O
ere O
the O
long O

      | O
voyage O
was O
concluded O
, O
had O
obtained O
fatal O
and O
irremediable O
ascendency O
, O
and O
occasioned O
those O

      | O
sufferings O
and O
death O
which O
in O
our O
first B-ORDINAL
chapters O
we O
described O
. O
| 
  | O
To O
Edward O
, O
though O
the O
death O
of O
his O
father O
had O
caused O
him O
much O
childish O
grief O
, O
still O
more O
|
      | O
perhaps O
from O
sympathy O
with O
the O
deep O
suffering O
of O
his O
mother O
, O
than O
a O
perfect O
consciousness O
of O
|
      | O
his O
own O
heavy O
loss O
, O
the O
|  | O
manner O
|  | O
in O
which O
he O
died O
was O
to O
him O
a O
source O
of O
actual O
pride O
. O
|
      | O
He O
had O
always O
loved O
the O
histories O
of O
heroes O
, O
military O
and O
naval O
, O
and O
gloried O
in O
the O
idea O
that O
|
      | O
his O
father O
had O
been O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
, O
and O
died O
as O
they O
did O
, O
bravely O
fighting O
against O
superior O

      | O
numbers O
, O
and O
in O
the O
moment O
of O
a O
glorious O
victory O
. O
He O
had O
never O
seen O
death O
, O
and O
imagined O
not O

      | O
all O
the O
attendant O
horrors O
of O
such O
a O
one O
  O
and O
how O
that O
Ellen B-PERSON
could O
never O
even O
hear O
the O
word O

      | O
without O
shuddering O
he O
could O
not O
understand O
, O
nor O
why O
she O
should O
always O
so O
painfully O
shrink O
from O

      | O
the O
remotest O
reference O
to O
that O
night O

which O
was O
only O
associated O
in O
his O
mind O

emotions O

shone O
forth O
in O
such O

almost O

servant O

tired O

      | O
out O
with O
the O
fretful O
impatience O
of O
Mrs. O
Fortescue B-PERSON
during O
the O
voyage O
, O
and O
disappointed O
that O
she O

      | O
did O
not O
at O
once O
proceed O
to O
London B-GPE

demanded O
her O

as O
she O
could O
not O
stay O
any O

The O
visible O
illness O
of O
her O
mistress O
might O
have O
spared O
this O
unfeeling O

      | O
act O

but O
Eleanor B-PERSON
had O
never O
shown O
feeling O

kindness O
to O
her O
inferiors O
, O
and O
therefore O
, O
perhaps O
, O

      | O
had O
no O
right O
to O
expect O
them O

Her O
suppressed O
anger O

annoyance O
so O
increased O
physical O

      | O
suffering O
, O
that O
had O
it O
not O
been O
for O
her O

sunk O
at O
once O
  O
but O
for O
their O

      | O
sakes O
she O
struggled O
with O
that O
deadly O
exhaustion O
, O
and O
set O
off O
the O
very O
next O
morning O
, O
without O

, O
despite O
her O

every O

, O
Mrs. O
Fortescue B-PERSON
became O
too O
ill O

There O
was O
no O

when O
the O

in O
the O

for O
though O
only B-DATE

the O
room O
was O
sufficiently O
large O
, O
and O
the O
evenings O
|
      | O
sufficiently O
chill O
, O
for O
a O
fire O
to O
add O
greatly O
to O
its O
aspect O
of O
true O
English B-LANGUAGE
comfort O
. O
There O
|
      | O
were O
many O
admirable O
pictures O
suspended O
on O
the O
walls O
, O
and O
well O

filled O
book O

      | O
maps O
, O
stands O
of O
beautiful O
flowers O
, O
and O
some O
ingenious O
toys O
, O
all O
seeming O
to O
proclaim O
the O
|
      | O
apartment O
as O
the O
especial O
possession O
of O
the O
young O
party O
who O
were O
this B-TIME
evening I-TIME
busily O
engaged O
|
      | O
at O
the O
large O
round O
table O
which O
occupied O
the O
centre O
of O
the O
room O
. O
They O
were O
only B-CARDINAL
four I-CARDINAL
in O
number O
, O
|
      | O
but O
what O
with O
a O
large O
desk O
piled O
with O
books O
and O
some O
most O
alarming O
- O
sized O
dictionaries O
, O
which O
|
      | O
occupied O
the O
elder O
of O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
lads O
, O
the O
embroidery O
frame O
of O
the O
elder O
girl O
, O
the O
dissected O
map O

      | O
before O
her O
sister O
, O
and O
two B-CARDINAL
or O
three B-CARDINAL
books O
scattered O
round O
the O
younger O
boy O
, O
the O
table O
seemed O
so O
|
      | O
well O
filled O
that O
Miss O
Harcourt B-PERSON
had O
quietly O
ensconced O
herself O
in O
her O
own O
private O
little O
corner O
, O
|
      | O
sufficiently O
near O
to O
take O
an O
interest O
, O
and O
sometimes O
join O
in O
the O
conversation O
of O
her O
youthful O
|
      | O
charge O
  O
but O
so O
apart O
as O
to O
be O
no O
restraint O
upon O
them O
, O
and O
to O
enable O
her O
to O
pursue O
her O
own O
|
      | O
occupations O
of O
either O
reading O
, O
writing O
, O
or O
working O
uninterruptedly O
. O
Could O
poor O
Mrs. O
Fortescue B-PERSON
|
      | O
have O
glanced O
on O
the O
happy O
group O
, O
she O
certainly O
might O
have O
told O
her O
sister O
, O
with O
some O
show O
of O
|
      | O
justice O
, O
that O
there O
was O
such O
an O
equal O
distribution O
of O
interesting O
and O
animated O
expression O
|
      | O
( O
which O
is O
the O
great O
beauty O
of O
youth O
) O
, O
that O
she O
could O
not O
have O
known O
the O
trial O
of O
having O
such O
a O
|
      | O
heavy O
, O
dull O
, O
unhappy O
child O
as O
Ellen B-PERSON
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
indeed O
, O
we O
rather O
think O
, O
would O
not O
have O
|
      | O
considered O
such O
a O
trial O
, O
except O
as O
it O
proved O
ill O
- O
health O
and O
physical O
pain O
in O
the O
little O
|
      | O
sufferer O
  O
and O
, O
perhaps O
her O
increased O
care O
and O
tenderness O
( O
for O
such O
with O
her O
would O
have O
been O
|
      | O
the O
consequence O
of O
the O
same O
cause O
which O
had O
created O
her O
sister O
's O
neglect O
) O
might O
have O
removed O
|
      | O
both O
the O
depression O
of O
constant O
but O
impalpable O
illness O
, O
and O
the O
expression O
of O
heaviness O
and O
|
      | O
gloom O
. O
Certain O
it O
is O
, O
that O
her O
own O
Herbert B-PERSON
had O
, O
with O
regard O
to O
delicate O
health O
, O
given O
her O
more O

      | O
real O
and O
constant O
anxiety O
than O
Eleanor B-PERSON
had O
ever O
allowed O
herself O
to O
experience O
with O
Ellen B-ORG
  O
but O
|
      | O
there O
was O
nothing O
in O
the O
boy O
's O
peculiarly O
interesting O
countenance O
to O
denote O
the O
physical O

      | O
suffering O
he O
very O
often O
endured O
. O
Care O
and O
love O
had O
so O
surrounded O
his O
path O
with O
blessings O
, O
that O
|
      | O
he O
was O
often O
heard O
to O
declare O
, O
that O
he O
never O
even O
wished O
to O
be O
as O
strong O
as O
his O
brother O
, O
or O
to O
|
      | O
share O
his O
active O
pleasures O
, O
he O
had O
so O
many O
others O
equally O
delightful O
. O
Whether O
it O
was O
his O
|
      | O
physical O
temperament O
, O
inducing O
a O
habitude O
of O
reflection O
and O
studious O
thought O
much O
beyond O
his O

      | O
years O
, O
or O
whether O
the O
unusually O
gifted O
mind O
worked O
on O
the O
frame O
, O
or O
the O
one O
combined O
to O
form O

      | O
the O
other O

it O
would O
be O
as O
impossible O
to O
decide O
with O

him O
as O
with O
hundreds B-CARDINAL
of O
others O

      | O
like O
him O
  O
but O
he O
certainly O
seemed O
, O
not O
only O
to O
his O
parents O
, O
but O
to O
their O
whole O
household O
, O
and O
|
      | O
to O
every O
one O
who O
casually O
associated O
with O
him O
, O
to O
have O
more O
in O
him O
of O
heaven O
than O
earth O
  O
as O
if O

      | O
indeed O

were O
only O

And O
often O
, O

often O
his O

heart O
ached O
with O
its O

      | O
very O
intensity O
of O
love O
, O
causing O
the O
unspoken O
dread O

hope O

retain O
one O

that O
the O
vast O
difference O
in O

      | O
arose O

and O
I O
will O
give O
you O
two B-CARDINAL
capital O
reasons O
for O
my O
advice O

|
      | O
Firstly B-ORDINAL
, O
wonder O
is O
the O
offspring O
of O
ignorance O
, O
and O
has O
two B-CARDINAL
opposite O
effects O
on O
my O
sex O
and O
on O
|
      | O
yours O
. O
With O
us O
it O
is O
closely O
connected O
with O
philosophy O
, O
for O
we O
are O
told O
in O
' O
wonder O
all O
|
      | O
philosophy O
begins O
, O
in O
wonder O
it O
ends O
, O
and O
adoration O
fills O
up O
the O
interspace O
  O
' O
but O
with O
you O
, O
|
      | O
poor O
weak O
creatures O
, O
the O
only O
effect O
it O
produces O
is O
increased O
curiosity O
, O
of O
which O
you O
have O
|
      | O
naturally O
a O
more O
than O
adequate O
supply O
. O
Secondly B-ORDINAL
, O
if O
you O
begin O
to O
wonder O
and O
expect O
, O
and O
|
      | O
speculate O
as O
to O
the O
ayes O
and O
noes O
of O
a O
contingency O
to O
- O
night O
, O
you O
will O
not O
cease O
talking O
till O
|
      | O
mamma O
really O
does O
appear O
  O
and O
then O
good O
- O
by O
to O
my O
theme O
, O
for O
to O
write O
while O
your O
tongue O
is O
|
      | O
running O
, O
is O
impossible O
. O
So O
pray O
, O
take O
my O
advice O
, O
on O
consideration O
that O
you O
have O
had O
as O
good O
a O
|
      | O
sermon O
from O
me O
as O
my O
reverend O
brother O
Herbert B-PERSON
can O
ever O
hope O
to O
give O

" O

" O
I O
do O
not O
think O
mamma O

papa O
will O
be O
quite O
satisfied O
if O
he O
do O
not O
give O
us O
a O
much O
better O

      | O
one O
, O
even O
the O
very O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
he O
attempts O
it O

" O
rejoined O
Emmeline B-ORG

with O
a O
very O
arch O
look O

What O

you O
against O
me O

You O

parts O

gently O

sure O

Percy B-PERSON

perceiving O
with O
regret O

expression O

from O
his O
extraordinary O

of O

was O
liable O
to O
the O

      | O
latter O

Miss O

that O

      | O
their O
intercourse O

her O
children O
should O
be O
as O
unrestrained O

Had O
Caroline B-PERSON

sentiments O
received O
encouragement O

would O
have O
interfered O

the O

      | O
raillery O
of O
Percy B-PERSON

the O
earnestness O
of O
Herbert B-PERSON
, O
she O
knew O
were O
more O
likely O
to O
produce O
an O

      | O
effect O
than O
any O
thing O
like O
a O
rebuke O
from O
herself O

which O
would O
only O
have O
caused O
restraint O

      | O
before O
her O

future O
. O
It O
was O
through O
this O
perfect O
unrestraint O
that O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
had O
become O
so O

      | O
thoroughly O
acquainted O
with O

children O

That O
Caroline B-PERSON

sentiments O

      | O
caused O
her O
often O
real O
pain O
was O
true O
, O

it O
was O
far O
better O
to O
know O
them O

endeavor O
to O

      | O
correct O

remove O
them O
, O
by O
causing O
education O
to O
bear O
upon O
the O
faults O

revealed O

the O
constant O
fear O

reproof O

industriously O

      | O
pursued O

breaking O

the O
undefinable O

      | O

painful O
sensation O
of O
loneliness O

which O
was O
creeping O
over O

filled O
her O

only O
knew O
that O

      | O
journey O
, O
her O
kiss O

Never O

The O
time O
passed O

so O
quickly O

that O
there O
was O
a O
general O
start O

nearly B-TIME

Mr. O

Caroline B-PERSON
could O
not O
enter O

feelings O

at O

moment O
: O
it O
was O
a O

      | O
great O
effort O
to O
prevent O
a O
feeling O
of O
irritation O
, O
believing O
that O
he O
directly O
pointed O
at O
her O
, O
|
      | O
and O
determining O
that O
as O
neither O
he O
nor O
any O
one O
else O
had O
any O
right O
to O
interfere O
with O
her O

      | O
private O
thoughts O
, O
and O
that O
they O
could O
do O
harm O
to O
none O
while O
confined O
to O
her O
own O
breast O
, O
she O

      | O
resolved O
not O
to O
overcome O
them O
, O

so O
could O
not O
join O
with O
any O
fervor O
in O
the O
prayer O

To O
Edward O
all O
was O
strange O

While O
the O

mind O
had O
been O
most O
sedulously O

cultivated O

never O

even O
the O
public O
ordinances O
of O
religion O
, O
much O
less O
its O

      | O
inward O
spirit O
. O
His O
mother O
had O
often O
and O
often O
felt O
a O
pang O
of O
reproach O
, O
at O
thus O
neglecting O
that O
|
      | O
which O
an O
inward O
voice O
would O
whisper O
was O
most O
essential O
  O
but O
she O
was O
wo O
nt O
to O
silence O
the O
pang O
|
      | O
by O
the O
determined O
idea O
, O
that O
she O
was O
neither O
worthy O
nor O
able O
to O
give O
him O
such O
solemn O
lessons O
, O
|
      | O
and O
that O
it O
would O
come O
by O
instinct O
to O
him O
in O
after O
years B-DATE

him O

such O
things O

He O
had O
been O
now O
and O
then O
to O
church O
, O
but O
it O
was O
a O
mere O
form O
, O
regarded O
as O
|
      | O
a O
weary O
duty O
, O
from O
which O
he O
escaped O
whenever O
he O
could O
. O
The O
present O
scene O
, O
then O
, O
completely O
|
      | O
bewildered O
him O
. O
He O
had O
always O
fancied O
himself O
superior O
to O
any O
of O
the O
boys O
he O
had O
associated O

      | O
with O
  O
but O
as O
he O
looked O
at O
and O
listened O
to O
Herbert B-PERSON
, O
who O
seemed O
at O
most O
only O
two O
years O
older O
|
      | O
than O
himself O
, O
he O
became O
sensible O
of O
a O
very O
strange O
and O
disagreeable O
, O
but O
a O
very O
decided O
|
      | O
feeling O
of O
inferiority O
: O
and O
then O
, O
too O
, O
it O
was O
so O
incomprehensible O
the O
servants O
all O
joining O
|
      | O
them O
, O
a O
class O
of O
people O
whom O
in O
India B-GPE
he O
had O
been O
taught O
so O
to O
consider O
his O
inferiors O
, O
that O
|
      | O
even O
to O
speak O
with O
them O
was O
a O
species O
of O
degradation O
  O
and O
he O
was O
destined O
to O
be O
still O
more O
|
      | O
surprised O
, O
for O
before O
they O
left O
the O
library O
, O
he O
heard O
his O
aunt O
and O
uncle O
address O
them O
all O
, O
and O
|
      | O
say O
a O
few O
kind O
words O
, O
and O
make O
inquiries O
after O
their O
families O
to O
each O
. O

  | O
To O
Ellen O
that O
evening B-TIME
service O
recalled O
some O
of O
Mr. O
Myrvin B-PERSON
's O
instructions O
, O
and O
seemed O
to O
help O

      | O
her O
to O
realize O
those O
new O
thoughts O
and O
feelings O
, O
which O
she O
had O
learned O
, O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
, O
in O

      | O
Wales B-GPE
. O
Her O
father O
had O
, O
indeed O
, O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
year I-DATE
of O
his O
life O
tried O
to O
give O
her O
some O
ideas O
of O
|
      | O
religion O
  O
but O
having O
only O
so O
very O
lately O
begun O
to O
think O
seriously O
himself O
, O
he O
felt O
diffident O
|
      | O
and O
uncertain O
of O
his O
own O
powers O
, O
and O
so O
left O
an O
impression O
more O
of O
awe O
toward O
the O
subject O
than O
|
      | O
of O
love O
, O
which O
to O
a O
disposition O
such O
as O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
was O
unfortunate O
. O
| 
  | O
A O
very O
short O
time O
sufficed O
for O
Percy B-WORK_OF_ART

Emmeline I-WORK_OF_ART
to O
introduce O
their O
cousins O

all O

Oakwood B-FAC

really O
a O
place O
for O

      | O
imagination O

It O
was O
a O

the O

, O
when O
the O
family O
returned O
at O
the O
Restoration B-PRODUCT
, O
|
      | O
caused O
much O
of O
the O
old O
house O
to O
be O
pulled O
down O
, O

replaced O
with O

for O
a O

however O

quite O
sufficient O

The O

in O
deep O

pronounced O
by O
both O

more O

the O

would O
resign O

      | O
the O
honor O

In O
vain O
the O

implored O
him O

spare O
them O
the O
disgrace O
of O
such O
an O

      | O
expulsion O

inexorable O

  | O
This O
conduct O

in O
itself O
so O
upright O
, O
was O
painted O
by O
the O
smarting O
offenders O
in O
such O
colors O
, O
|
      | O
that O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
gradually O
but O
surely O
found O
his O
school O
abandoned O
, O
and O
himself O
so O
|
      | O
misrepresented O
, O
that O
a O
spirit O
less O
self O

possessed O
and O
secure O
in O
its O
own O
integrity O
must O
have O

      | O
sunk O
beneath O
it O

But O
he O
had O
some O
true O
friends O

none O
more O
active O
and O
earnest O
than O
Mr. O

      | O
Hamilton B-PERSON
. O
A O
very O
brief O
residence O
at O
Oakwood B-ORG
Rectory I-ORG
removed O
even O
the O
recollection O
of O
the O

      | O
injustice O
he O
had O
experienced O
  O
and O
he O
himself O
, O
as O
pastor O
and O
friend O
, O
proved O
a O
treasure O
to O
high O

low O

Ten B-CARDINAL

gladly O

About B-QUANTITY

Lady B-PERSON

Grahame I-PERSON

      | O
whose O

often O

Her O

Grahame I-PERSON

earliest O
friend O

at O

at O

in O
manhood O

Lady B-PERSON
Helen I-PERSON
|
      | O
the O
youngest O
daughter O
of O
a O
marquis B-PERSON
, O
had O
been O
intimate O
with O
Emmeline B-PRODUCT
and O
Eleanor B-PERSON
Manvers I-PERSON
from O
|
      | O
childhood O
, O
and O
had O
always O
admired O
and O
wished O
to O
resemble O
the O
former O
, O
but O
always O
failed O
, O
she O
|
      | O
believed O
, O
from O
being O
constituted O
so O
differently O
  O
others O
might O
have O
thought O
from O
her O
utter O
want O

      | O
of O
energy O

mental O
strength O

The O
marriage O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
appeared O
likely O
to O
be O
a O
happy O
one O
, O
but O
it O
|
      | O
was O
too O
soon O
proved O
the O
contrary O
. O
Grahame O
was O
a O
man O
of O
strict O
, O
perhaps O
severe O
principles O
  O
his O
|
      | O
wife O
, O
though O
she O
never O
did O
any O
thing O
morally O
wrong O
, O
scarcely O
knew O
the O
meaning O
of O
the O
word O
. O
|
      | O
Provoked O
with O
himself O
for O
his O
want O
of O
discrimination O
, O
in O
imagining O
Lady B-PERSON
Helen I-PERSON
so O
different O
to O
|
      | O
the O
being O
she O
really O
was O
  O
more O
than O
once O
discovering O
she O
did O
not O
speak O
the O
exact O
truth O
, O
or O
act O
|
      | O
with O
the O
steady O
uprightness O
he O
demanded O
, O
his O
manner O
became O
almost O
austere O
  O
and O
, O
in O
|
      | O
consequence O
, O
becoming O
more O
and O
more O
afraid O
of O
him O
, O
Lady B-PERSON
Helen I-PERSON
sunk O
lower O
and O
lower O
in O
his O
|
      | O
esteem O
. O
| 
  | O
Two B-CARDINAL
girls O
and O
a O
boy O
were O
the O
fruits O
of O
this O
union O
. O
Lady B-PERSON
Helen I-PERSON
had O
made O
a O
great O
many O
|
      | O
excellent O
resolutions O
with O
regard O
to O
their O
rearing O
and O
education O
, O
which O
she O
eagerly O
confided O
|
      | O
to O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
but O
when O
the O
time O
of O
trial O
came O
, O
weakness O
and O
false O
indulgence O
so O
|
      | O
predominated O
, O
that O
Grahame B-GPE
, O
to O
counteract O
these O
evil O
influences O
, O
adopted O
a O
contrary O
extreme O
, O
|
      | O
and O
, O
by O
a O
system O
of O
constant O
reserve O
and O
severity O
, O
became O
an O
object O
of O
as O
much O
terror O
to O
his O
|
      | O
children O
as O
he O
was O
to O
his O
wife O
. O
But O
he O
did O
not O
pursue O
this O
conduct O
without O
pain O
, O
and O
never O
did O
|
      | O
he O
visit O
Oakwood B-ORG
without O
bitter O
regret O
that O
his O
home O
was O
not O
the O
same O
. O
| 
  | O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
had O
often O
tried O
to O
alter O
the O
aspect O
of O
affairs O
at O
Moorlands B-GPE
  O
the O
|
      | O
former O
, O
by O
entreating O
Grahame B-PERSON
to O
be O
less O
severe O
  O
the O
latter O
, O
by O
urging O
Lady B-PERSON
Helen I-PERSON
to O
a O
firmer O
|
      | O
mode O
of O
conduct O
. O
But O
those O
friendly O
efforts O
were O
as O
yet O
entirely O
useless O
. O
Grahame O
became O
a O
|
      | O
member O
of O
Parliament B-ORG
, O
which O
took O
his O
family O
to O
London B-GPE
for O
five B-DATE
or I-DATE
six I-DATE
months I-DATE
in I-DATE
the I-DATE
year I-DATE
— O
a O
|
      | O
particularly O
agreeable O
change O
to O
Lady B-PERSON
Helen I-PERSON
, O
who O
then O
associated O
with O
her O
sisters O
, O
whose O
|
      | O
families O
were O
conducted O
much O
on O
the O
same O
fashion O
as O
her O
own O
, O
but O
unfortunately O
only O
increasing O
|
      | O
the O
discomfort O
of O
Moorlands B-GPE
when O
they O
returned O
to O
it O
. O
And O
this O
was O
the O
more O
to O
be O
regretted O
, O
|
      | O
from O
the O
fact O
that O
both O
Grahame B-PERSON
and O
his O
wife O
were O
full O
of O
good O
intentions O
, O
and O
had O
the O
one O
|
      | O
been O
more O
yielding O
, O
and O
the O
other O
more O
firm O
, O
there O
might O
have O
been O
no O
small O
share O
of O
happiness O
|
      | O
for O
both O
. O
| 
  | O
But O
heavy O
as O
Lady B-PERSON
Helen I-PERSON
thought O
her O
trial O
in O
the O
want O
of O
her O
husband O
's O
confidence O
and O
love O
, O
|
      | O
and O
which O
she O
had O
greatly O
brought O
upon O
herself O
, O
it O
was O
light O
in O
comparison O
with O
that O
of O
Mrs. O

      | O
Greville B-ORG
, O
another O
near O
neighbor O
and O
valued O
friend O
of O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
. O
She O
had O
loved O
and O
married O

      | O
a O
man O
whose O
winning O
manners O

and O
an O
ever O

varying O
flow O
of O
intelligent O

      | O
conversation O
, O
had O
completely O
concealed O
, O
till O
too O
late O
, O
his O
real O
character O

Left O

his O

with O
a O
capital O

large O
fortune O
  O
educated O
at O
a O
very O
large O

      | O
public O
school O
, O
at O
which O
he O
learned O
literally O
nothing O

vice O
, O
and O
how O
effectually O
to O
conceal O

      | O
it O
  O
courted O
and O
flattered O
wherever O
he O
went O

he O

vain O

overbearing O

and O
extravagant O
  O
with O

      | O
no O

that O
of O

in O
all O

even O

could O
not O

thoroughly O
enjoyed O
without O
some O
large O
bets O
depending O
on O
the O
day B-DATE

sport O
: O
his O
thoughts O
from O
|
      | O
boyhood O
were O
so O
completely O
centered O
in O
self O
, O
that O
he O
had O
affection O
for O
nothing O

He O
had O

      | O
indeed O
fancied O
he O
loved O
Jessie B-PERSON
Summers I-PERSON
, O
when O
he O
had O
so O
successfully O
wooed O
her O
  O
but O
the O

      | O
illusion O
was O
speedily O
dispelled O

and O
repeatedly O
he O
cursed O
his O
folly O
for O
plaguing O
himself O
with O

      | O
a O
wife O

His O
first B-ORDINAL
child O

too O

was O
a O

that O
annoyed O
him O
still O
more O
  O

when O
, O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE

, O
a O
boy O
was O
granted O

certainly O
rejoiced O

it O
was O
such O
rejoicing O
as O
to O
fill O
his O

      | O
wife O
's O
heart O
with O
an O
agony O
of O
dread O
  O
for O

swore O

would O
make O
his O

this O
in O
Mrs. O
Greville B-PERSON
's O
case O
was O
a O
very O
great O
mistake O
. O
It O
was O
impossible O
to O

      | O
associate O
even O
casually O
with O
her O
, O
without O
feeling O
intuitively O
that O
she O
suffered O
deeply O
, O
but O
|
      | O
the O
emotion O
such O
conviction O
called O
was O

As O
anxious O
and O
as O
earnest O
a O
parent O
as O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
herself O
, O
Mrs. O
Greville B-PERSON
failed O
not O
to O

      | O
inculcate O
the O
good O
in O
both O
her O
children O
, O
and O
still O
more O
forcibly O
, O
when O
they O
became O
old O
enough O

      | O
to O
observe O
, O
by O
example O
than O
by O

But O
with O
Alfred B-PERSON
there O
must O
have O
been O
an O
utter O

      | O
hopelessness O
as O
to O
the O
fruit O
of O
her O
anxious O

, O

she O
not O
possessed O
that O
clinging O
, O

      | O
single O
- O
hearted O
trust O
which O
taught O
her O
that O
no O
difficulty O
should O
deter O
from O
a O
simple O
duty O
, O
and O
|
      | O
that O
nothing O
was O
too O
hard O
for O
Him O
who O
— O
if O
He O
saw O
that O
she O
shrunk O
not O
from O
the O
charge O

      | O
responsibility O
which O
, O
in O
permitting O
her O
to O
become O
a O
mother O

he O
had O
given O
, O

did O
all O
she O

      | O
could O
to O
counteract O
those O
evil O
influences O

for O
the O
removal O

Mrs. O

earnestly O

of O
Nature B-WORK_OF_ART

all O

      | O
its O
fresh O

pure O
associations O
in O
the O
minds O
of O
her O
children O
while O
yet O
young O
, O
knowing O
that O
once O

      | O
obtained O
, O
the O
pleasures O
of O
the O
world O
would O
be O
far O
less O
likely O
to O
obtain O
too O
powerful O
dominion O
. O

      | O
That O
which O
the O
world O
often O
terms O
romance O
, O
she O
felt O
to O
be O
a O
high O
, O
pure O
sense O
of O
poetry O
in O
the O
|
      | O
Universe B-NORP
and O
in O
Man B-GPE
, O
which O
she O
was O
quite O
as O
anxious O
to O
instill O
as O
many O
mothers O
to O
root O
out O
. O
|
      | O
She O
did O
not O
believe O
that O
to O
cultivate O
the O
spiritual O
needed O
the O
banishment O
of O
the O
matter O
of O
|
      | O
fact O
  O
but O
she O
believed O
, O
that O
to O
infuse O
the O
latter O
with O
the O
former O
would O
be O
their O
best O
and O
|
      | O
surest O
preventive O
against O
all O
that O
was O
low O
and O
mean O
  O
their O
best O
help O
in O
the O
realization O
of O
a O
|
      | O
constant O
unfailing O
piety O
. O
For O
the O
same O
reason O
she O
cultivated O
a O
taste O
for O
the O
beautiful O
, O
not O
|
      | O
only O
in O
her O
girls O
, O
but O
in O
her O
boys O
— O
and O
beauty O
, O
not O
in O
arts O
and O
nature O
alone O
, O
but O
in O
character O
. O
|
      | O
She O
did O
not O
allude O
to O
beauty O
of O
merely O
the O
high O
and O
striking O
kind O
, O
but O
to O
the O
lowly O
virtues O
, O
|
      | O
struggles O
, O
faith O
, O
and O
heroism O
in O
the O
poor O
— O
their O
forbearance O
and O
kindness O
to O
one O
|
      | O
another O
— O
marking O
something O
to O
admire O
, O
even O
in O
the O
most O
rugged O
and O
surly O
, O
that O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
sight O
|
      | O
would O
seem O
so O
little O
worthy O
of O
notice O
. O
It O
was O
gradually O
, O
and O
almost O
unconsciously O
, O
to O
accustom O
|
      | O
her O
daughters O
to O
such O
a O
train O
of O
thought O
and O
sentiment O
, O
that O
she O
so O
particularly O
laid O
aside O
|
      | O
one B-CARDINAL
part O
of O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
to O
have O
them O
with O
her O
alone O
  O
ostensibly O
, O
it O
was O
to O
give O
part O
of O
their B-DATE
day I-DATE
|
      | O
to O
working O
for O
the O
many O
poor O
, O
to O
whom O
gifts O
of O
ready O
- O
made O
clothing O
are O
sometimes O
much O
more O
|
      | O
valuable O
than O
money O
  O
but O
the O
|  | O
education O
|  | O
of O
that O
one B-TIME
hour I-TIME
she O
knew O
might O
, O
for O
the O
right O
|
      | O
cultivation O
of O
the O
heart O
, O
do O
more O
than O
the O
mere O
|  | O
teaching O
|  | O
of O
five B-CARDINAL
or I-CARDINAL
six I-CARDINAL
, O
and O
that O
|
      | O
education O
, O
much O
as O
she O
loved O
and O
valued O
Miss O
Harcourt B-PERSON
, O
she O
had O
from O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
resolved O
should O
|
      | O
come O
from O
her O
alone O
. O
| 
  | O
To O
Emmeline O
this O
mode O
of O
life O
was O
so O
happy O
, O
she O
could O
not O
imagine O
any O
thing O
happier O
. O
But O
|
      | O
Caroline B-PERSON
often O
and O
often O
envied O
her O
great O
friend O
Annie B-PERSON
Grahame I-PERSON
, O
and O
believed O
that O
occasional O
|
      | O
visits O
to O
London B-GPE
would O
make O
her O
much O
happier O
than O
remaining O
all O
the O
year O
round O
at O
Oakwood B-ORG
, O
and O
|
      | O
only O
with O
her O
own O
family O
. O
She O
knew O
the O
expression O
of O
such O
sentiments O
would O
meet O
no O
sympathy O
at O
|
      | O
home O
, O
and O
certainly O
not O
obtain O
their O
gratification O
, O
so O
she O
tried O
to O
check O
them O
, O
except O
when O
in O
|
      | O
company O
with O
Annie B-PERSON
and O
Lady B-PERSON
Helen I-PERSON
  O
but O
her O
mother O
knew O
them O
, O
and O
, O
from O
the O
discontent O
and O
|
      | O
unhappiness O
they O
so O
often O
engendered O
in O
her O
child O
, O
caused O
her O
both O
pain O
and O
uneasiness O
. O
But O
|
      | O
she O
did O
not O
waver O
in O
her O
plans O
, O
because O
only O
in O
Emmeline B-GPE
they O
seemed O
to O
succeed O
: O
nor O
did O
she O
, O
|
      | O
as O
perhaps O
some O
over O
- O
scrupulous O
mothers O
would O
have O
done O
, O
check O
Caroline B-PERSON
's O
association O
with O
|
      | O
Miss O
Grahame B-PERSON
. O
She O
knew O
that O
those O
principles O
must O
be O
indeed O
of O
little O
worth O
, O
which O
could O
only O
|
      | O
actuate O
in O
retirement O
, O
and O
when O
free O
from O
temptation O
. O
That O
to O
prevent O
intimacy O
with O
all O
, O
|
      | O
except O
with O
those O
of O
whom O
she O
exactly O
approved O
, O
would O
be O
impossible O
, O
if O
she O
ever O
meant O
her O
|
      | O
daughters O
to O
enter O
the O
world O
  O
and O
therefore O
she O
endeavored O
so O
to O
obtain O
their O
unrestrained O
|
      | O
confidence O
and O
affection O
, O
as O
to O
be O
regarded O
, O
both O
now O
and O
when O
they O
were O
young O
women O
, O
as O
their O

      | O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
best O

  O

that O

      | O
however O

very O
silly O

not O

half B-CARDINAL

up O

a O
very O
different O

for O
him O

indeed O

therefore O
your O
most O

so O
of O

increased O
difficulty O
in O
conquering O
its O
constant O
accompaniment O

      | O
ill O
temper O

would O
more O
than O
balance O
the O
pleasure O

not O

one O
so O
often O
at O
the O
expense O
of O

of O
that O

become O
of O
Mary B-PERSON

let O
you O
be O
as O
much O
together O
as O
possible O
during O

" O
Oh O

yes O
, O
mamma O

a O
great O
deal O

unfortunately O
Mr. O

at O
home O
almost O
all O
the O

      | O
time O
you O
were O
away O

poor O
Mary B-PERSON
could O
not O
often O
leave O
her O
mother O

I O
do O
n't O
feel O
as O
if O
it O

were O
quite O
right O
for O

go O
so O
often O
there O

I O
am O
sure O
Mrs. O
Greville B-PERSON

      | O
Mary B-PERSON
must O
both O
feel O
still O
more O
uncomfortable O

any O
one O
is O
there O
to O
see O
how O
unkind O
he O
is O
, O

hear O
the O
cruel O
things O
he O
says O

Oh O
, O
how O
I O
do O
wish O
I O
could O
make O
poor O
Mary B-PERSON
more O
happy O
! O
" O

" O
She O
would O
tell O
you O

affection O

Yours B-WORK_OF_ART

better O

wiser O

I O

a O
great O
source O

Ellen B-PERSON
looks O
very O
much O
as O
if O
she O
would O
like O
to O
know O
who O
this O
Mary B-PERSON
is O
, O
that O
is O
so O

      | O
tried O
— O
suppose O
you O
tell O
her O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Emmeline O
eagerly O
obeyed O

painting O
her O
friend O

such O
glowing O
colors O

however O
tried O
she O
might O
be O

a O
person O
so O
good O

be O
happy O

notwithstanding O
  O
besides O

      | O
to O
be O
loved O
so O
by O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON

Herbert B-PERSON
, O
discovered O
to O
her O
mind O
such O
superior O
qualities O
, O
|
      | O
that O
she O
almost O
wondered O
how O
Emmeline B-ORG
could O
speak O
of O
her O
so O
familiarly O
, O
and O
think O
of O
her O
as O

      | O
her O
own O
particular O
friend O

But O
the O
conversation O
on O
her O
, O
and O
then O
on O
other O
topics O
, O
so O
|
      | O
interested O
her O
, O
that O
she O
was O
almost O
as O
sorry O
as O
her O
cousin O
, O
when O
it O
was O
interrupted O
by O
a O
visit O

      | O
from O
Lady B-PERSON

her O
daughter O

" O

dearest O
Emmeline B-ORG

" O
was O
the O
former O

lively O
greeting O

evincing O
far O

      | O
more O
warmth O

manner O

. O
" O
Do O
you O
know O
, O
the O
banks O
of O
the O
Dart O
have O
seemed O

      | O
so O
desolate O
without O
their O
guardian O
spirit O
, O
that O
the O
very O
flowers O
have O
hung O
their O
heads O
, O

      | O
the O
trees O

withered O

" O
I O
rather O
think O
the O
change O
of O
season O

not O
my O
absence O

been O
the O
cause O

melancholy O
facts O

Mrs. O

, O
in O
the O
same O
tone O

must O
follow O

example O

my O
neighbors O

rich O

poor O

you O
may O
appeal O
to O
as O
to O

      | O
the O
fact O
of O
your O
absence O

terrible O
lamentation O

this O
naughty O
little O
girl O
too O

who O
|
      | O
scarcely O
ever O
came O

many O
things O

do O

forgive O
me O

she O
added O
, O
more O
seriously O
, O
as O
she O
glanced O
on O
the O
deep O
mourning O
of O
her O
friend O

indeed O

another O
time O

already O
deep O
in O

her O

forward O

haughty O

fashionable O
courtesy O

a O
few O
unintelligible O
words O

      | O
caused O

indignant O

it O

difficulty O

kept O
silence O

made O

uncomfortable O

with O
even O
more O
than O

Annie B-PERSON

generally O
judging O

thought O
that O

Edward B-PERSON

of O
regular O
attendance O
on O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON

      | O
Ellen B-PERSON
would O
like O
to O
know O
all O
about O
it O

soon O

they O
proceeded O
accordingly O

" O
Well O

you O

inquired O
Miss O
Grahame B-PERSON

the O

      | O
moment O

had O
Caroline B-GPE
entirely O
to O
herself O
. O

  | O
" O
Edward B-PERSON
I O
think O
I O
may O
like O
very O
much O
  O
he O
is O
so O
affectionate O
and O
so O
good O
- O
natured O
, O
and O
as O

      | O
merry O
and O
full O
of O
fun O
as O
Percy B-PERSON
. O
And O
he O
is O
so O
handsome O
, O
Annie B-PERSON
, O
I O
think O
even O
you O
would O
admire O

      | O
him O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Then O
altogether O
he O
must O
be O
very O
unlike O
his O
sister O

I O
never O
saw O
a O
girl O
so O
plain O
, O
and O
I O
am O

      | O
sure O
she O
looks O
as O
if O
no O

could O
exist O
near O
her O

" O

" O
Mamma O

we O
must O
remember O
how O
short O
a O
time O
has O
elapsed O
since O
poor O
aunt O

death O
, O
and O
also O

      | O
that O
Ellen B-PERSON

not O
strong O

very O

" O

" O
That O
does O
not O
at O
all O
account O

I O
am O
sure O
she O

nothing O

" O

thoughtfully O
  O
" O

it O
actually O
became O

this O
only O
increased O

gave O

Emmeline O

so O

      | O
produced O

by O
her O
as O
|
      | O
Herbert B-PERSON
and O
Emmeline B-PRODUCT
and O
even O
Edward B-PERSON
did O
, O
that O
its O
very O
indulgence O
seemed O
to O
give O
her O
pain O
. O
|
      | O
Then O
Caroline B-PERSON
's O
confession O
too O
— O
could O
she O
ever O
have O
had O
courage O
to O
confess O
the O
indulgence O
of O
a O
|
      | O
feeling O
which O
she O
knew O
to O
be O
wrong O
— O
and O
all O
her O
aunt O
had O
said O
both O
to O
Caroline B-ORG
and I-ORG
Emmeline I-ORG
so O
|
      | O
fastened O
on O
her O
mind O
as O
to O
make O
her O
head O
ache O
, O
and O
she O
quite O
started O
when O
a O
loud O
shout O
sounded O
|
      | O
near O
them O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
It O
is O
only O
Percy O
, O
" O
said O
Emmeline B-PERSON
laughing O
  O
" O
I O
dare O
say O
he O
and O
Edward B-PERSON
are O
running O
a O
race O
or O
|
      | O
having O
some O
sort O
of O
fun O
. O
" O
And O
so O
they O
were O
  O
laughing O
, O
shouting O
, O
panting O
, O
they O
came O
full O
speed O
, O
|
      | O
darting O
in O
and O
out O
the O
trees O
in O
every O
variety O
of O
mathematical O
figures O
their O
ingenuity O
could O
|
      | O
frame O
  O
but O
as O
soon O
as O
Percy B-PERSON
's O
restless O
eye O
discovered O
Emmeline B-ORG
, O
he O
directed O
his O
course O
toward O

her O

exclaiming O
, O
" O

such O

will O
teach O

asked O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
clinging O
to O
his O
arm O
, O
and O
looking O
in O
his O
face O
with O
such O
an O

      | O
expression O
that O
there O
was O
little O
trace O
of O
ill O

temper O
. O
Emmeline O
meanwhile O
had O
made O
her O
brother O

      | O
a O
party O
in O
her O
indignation O
against O
Annie B-ORG
's O
pride O
, O
which O
he O
termed O
insolence O
, O
vowing O
he O
would O

      | O
make O
her O
feel O
it O
. O
And O
as O
they O
came O
in O
sight O
of O
her O
and O
Caroline B-PERSON
, O
he O
called O
out O
to O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
who O
, O

      | O
all O
her O
timidity O
returning O

tried O

draw O

" O
And O
Edward B-PERSON
did O
not O
wait O
a O
second B-ORDINAL
bidding O
, O
leaving O
Ellen B-PERSON
to O

      | O
Percy B-PERSON
, O
who O
threw O
his O
arm O
affectionately O
round O
her O
, O
and O
began O
talking O
to O
her O
so O
amusingly O
that O
|
      | O
she O
could O
not O
help O
laughing O
, O
and O
so O
devoted O
did O
he O
appear O
to O
her O
, O
that O
he O
had O
only O
time O
to O
|
      | O
greet O
Miss O
Grahame B-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
very O
marked O
and O
polite O
bow O
, O
and O
passed O
on O
. O
He O
wished O
to O
provoke O
, O
|
      | O
and O
he O
succeeded O
, O
for O
Annie B-PERSON
was O
always O
particularly O
pleased O
when O
the O
handsome O
, O
spirited O
Percy B-PERSON

      | O
Hamilton B-PERSON
paid O
her O
any O

that O

looking O
cousin O

as O
not O
even O
to O

her O
a O
word O

annoyed O
her O
as O
much O
as O
he O

      | O
desired O
. O
| 
  | O
Edward B-PERSON
's O
hasty O
progress O
to O
his O
aunt O
was O
slightly O
checked O
at O
seeing O
a O
stranger O
with O
her O
, O
but O
|
      | O
when O
he O
was O
introduced O
he O
made O
his O
bow O
with O
so O
much O
of O
his O
mother O
's O
grace O
, O
that O
, O
combined O
with O

      | O
the O
extraordinary O
likeness O

her O
feelings O

to O

exclaim O
, O
" O
Oh O
, O
how O
that O
look O
recalls O
the O

I O
could O

" O
Did O

did O
you O
know O

mother O

said O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
with O
so O
much O
eagerness O
that O
his O
cheeks O
|
      | O
crimsoned O
and O
his O
voice O
trembled.—"Were B-CARDINAL
you O
one B-CARDINAL

mamma's"—but O
he O
could O
not O
finish O

sentence O

head O

pressed O
him O
closer O

      | O
stooped O
down O
to O
kiss O

speaking O

that O
sudden O
and O
unexpected O
display O

A B-DATE

more O
brought O
Mrs. O
Greville B-PERSON
and O
Mary B-PERSON
to O
welcome O
their O
friends O
, O
and O
Ellen B-PERSON
had O
again O
|
      | O
the O
pain O
of O
being O
introduced O
to O
strangers O
  O
but O
this O
time O
it O
was O
only O
the O
pain O
of O
her O
own O
|
      | O
shyness O
, O
for O
could O
she O
have O
overcome O
that O
feeling O
, O
she O
might O
have O
felt O
even O
pleasure O
. O
As O
it O
|
      | O
was O
, O
the O
gentle O
voice O
and O
manner O
with O
which O
Mrs. O
Greville B-PERSON
addressed O
her O
, O
and O
the O
timid O
yet O
|
      | O
expressive O
glance O
of O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
told O
of O
such O
sympathy O
and O
kindness O
, O
that O
she O
felt O
attracted O
toward O
|
      | O
both O
, O
and O
could O
quite O
enter O
into O
Emmeline B-ORG
's O
enthusiastic O
admiration O
of O
her O
friend O
  O
not O
, O
|
      | O
however O
, O
believing O
it O
possible O
that O
she O
herself O
could O
ever O
be O
worthy O
to O
win O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
regard O
. O
|
      | O
Taught O
from O
such O
a O
very O
early O
age O
to O
believe O
herself O
so O
far O
inferior O
to O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
such O
|
      | O
characters O
as O
Herbert B-PERSON
and O
Mary B-PERSON
appeared O
to O
her O
so O
exalted O
, O
that O
it O
was O
quite O
impossible O
they O
|
      | O
could O
ever O
think O
of O
her O
  O
the O
constant O
little O
acts O
of O
unobtrusive O
kindness O
that O
her O
cousin O
|
      | O
showed O
her O
, O
she O
attributed O
to O
his O
extreme O
goodness O
, O
not O
from O
the O
most O
trifling O
merit O
in O
|
      | O
herself O
. O
She O
did O
indeed O
love O
him O
very O
dearly O
, O
the O
best O
next O
to O
her O
aunt O
  O
but O
so O
much O
of O
|
      | O
reverence O
mingled O
with O
it O
, O
that O
she O
was O
almost O
more O
reserved O
with O
him O
than O
with O
the O
others O
. O
|
      | O
But O
Herbert B-PERSON
was O
naturally O
reserved O
himself O
in O
words O
, O
and O
so O
he O
did O
not O
think O
any O
thing O
about O
|
      | O
it O
, O
except O
to O
wish O
and O
endeavor O
to O
make O
his O
little O
cousin O
happier O
than O
she O
seemed O
. O
| 
  | O
When O
contrasting O
Mary B-PERSON
Greville I-PERSON
with O
Annie B-PERSON
Grahame I-PERSON
, O
as O
she O
was O
rather O
fond O
of O
doing O
, O
Emmeline O
|
      | O
became O
so O
afraid O
she O
was O
disliking O
the O
latter O
more O
than O
she O
ought O
to O
do O
, O
that O
she O
never O
rested O
|
      | O
till O
she O
made O
an O
opportunity O
to O
confess O
all O
her O
feelings O
to O
her O
mother O
, O
and O
beg O
her O
to O
tell O
|
      | O
her O
if O
they O
were O
very O
wrong O
, O
and O
if O
she O
ought O
to O
like O
her O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
am O
not O
so O
unconscionable O
as O
to O
expect O
you O
to O
like O

one O
with O
whom O
you O
associate O
, O
my O

      | O
dear O
little O
girl O
, O
" O
replied O
her O
mother O
, O
fondly O
, O
for O
there O
was O
something O
in O
Emmeline B-ORG
's O
guileless O

      | O
confidence O
irresistibly O
claiming O
love O

" O
All O
we O
have O
to O
do O
when O
we O
find O
nothing O

exactly O

sympathizes O

our O
own O
feelings O

our O
own O
ideas O

right O

, O
is O
to O
try O
and O
find O
out O
|
      | O
some O
reason O
for O
their O
being O
so O
different O
  O
some O
circumstance O
that O
may O
have O
exposed O
them O
to O

      | O
greater O
temptations O

too O
much O

are O
a O
much O
greater O
trial O

some O

sorrow O

Now O
Annie B-PERSON
has O
had O
|
      | O
a O
great O
many O
more O
temptations O
of O
this O
kind O
than O
you O
or O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
and O
we O
can O
not O
expect O
one O
so O
very O

      | O
young O
entirely O
to O
resist O

present O
quiet O

I O
hope O
happy O
life O

therefore O
I O
do O
not O
take O

      | O
you O
or O
Caroline B-GPE
to O
London B-GPE
  O

Mr. O
Grahame B-PERSON

obliged O

be O
there O
for O
several B-DATE
months I-DATE
, O
and O
Lady O

      | O
Helen B-GPE
very O
naturally O
would O
not O
like O
to O
be O
separated O
either O
from O
him O
or O
her O
children O
. O
And O
then O
|
      | O
she O
has O
such O
a O
large O
family O
, O
and O
Annie B-PERSON
so O
many O
young O
relations O
, O
that O
you O
see O
Lady B-PERSON
Helen I-PERSON
could O
|
      | O
not O
keep O
her O
children O
quite O
as O
free O
from O
temptation O
as O
I O
do O
mine O
, O
and O
we O
should O
be O
more O
sorry O
|
      | O
for O
Annie B-PERSON
than O
blame O
her O
individually O
, O
however O
we O
may O
not O
like O
her O
faults O
. O
Do O
you O
understand O
|
      | O
me O
, O
my O
dear O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Oh O
, O
yes O
, O
mamma O
, O
and O
I O
am O
so O
glad O
I O
took O
courage O
to O
tell O
you O
all O
I O
felt O
. O
I O
am O
afraid O
I O
have O
|
      | O
encouraged O
many O
unkind O
thoughts O
about O
her O
, O
and O
I O
am O
quite O
sorry O
now O
, O
for O
I O
see O
she O
can O
not O
|
      | O
help O
them O
as O
much O
as O
I O
thought O
she O
could O
. O
I O
do O
not O
think O
I O
could O
ever O
make O
her O
my O
friend O
, O
but O
|
      | O
I O
will O
try O
very O
much O
not O
to O
dislike O
and O
avoid O
her O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
And O
that O
is O
all O
that O
is O
required O
of O
you O
, O
my O
love O
. O
When O
I O
tell O
you O
that O
our O
Father O
in O
Heaven O
|
      | O
commands O
us O
to O
love O
one O
another O
, O
and O
to O
avoid O
all O
unkindness O
in O
thought O
and O
deed O
, O
I O
do O
not O
|
      | O
mean O
that O
He O
desires O
us O
to O
love O
all O
alike O
, O
because O
He O
knew O
it O
would O
be O
neither O
for O
our O
|
      | O
happiness O
nor O
good O
that O
it O
should O
be O
so O
, O
but O
only O
to O
prevent O
the O
too O
great O
influence O
of O
|
      | O
prejudice O
and O
dislike O
. O
We O
might O
think O
such O
feelings O
can O
do O
no O
harm O
, O
because O
only O
confined O
to O
|
      | O
our O
own O
minds O
, O
but O
they O
would O
be O
sure O
gradually O
to O
lead O
us O
to O
taking O
pleasure O
in O
listening O
to O
|
      | O
their O
dispraise O
, O
and O
joining O
in O
it O
, O
and O
to O
seeing O
and O
talking O
only O
of O
their O
faults O
, O
forgetting O

      | O
that O
if O
we O
had O
been O
circumstanced O
exactly O
as O
they O
are O
, O
we O
might O
have O
been O
just O
the O
same O
: O
and O
|
      | O
this O
is O
the O
feeling O
David B-PERSON
condemns O
in O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
Psalms B-PERSON
we O
read O
this B-TIME
morning I-TIME

Are O
you O
tired O

      | O
listening O

me O
, O

shall O
we O

it O
over O
again O
together O

" O

  | O
Emmeline B-ORG
's O
only O
answer O
was O
to O
run O
eagerly O
for O
her O
little O
Bible B-WORK_OF_ART
, O
and O
with O
glowing O
cheeks O
and O
|
      | O
sparkling O
eyes O
listen O
to O
her O
mother O
, O
as O
she O
turned O
to O
the O
fifteenth B-ORDINAL
Psalm B-GPE
, O
and O
reading O
it O
|
      | O
through O
, O
particularly O
pointed O
out O
the O
third B-ORDINAL
verse O
, O
and O
so O
explained O
it O
, O
as O
easily O
and O
happily O
|
      | O
to O
satisfy O
her O
child O
as O
to O
the O
Divine O
authority O
for O
all O
that O
she O
had O
said O
, O
and O
to O
stamp O
them O
|
      | O
still O
more O
forcibly O
on O
her O
memory O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
And O
now O
I O
do O
not O
mean O
to O
talk O
to O
you O
any O
more O
, O
my O
darling O
, O
" O
she O
said O
, O
kissing O
the O
little O
|
      | O
earnest O
face O
upturned O
to O
hers O
. O
" O
You O
have O
heard O
quite O
enough O
to O
think O
about O
, O
and O
I O
am O
sure O
you O
|
      | O
will O
not O
forget O
it O
, O
so O
go O
and O
play O
  O
Ellen B-PERSON
must O
be O
wondering O
what O
has O
become O
of O
you O
. O
" O
And O
again O
|
      | O
full O
of O
glee O
, O
the O
happy O
child O
bounded O
away O
, O
exclaiming O
, O
as O
she O
did O
so O
, O
" O
Poor O
Annie B-PERSON
, O
I O
am O
glad O

      | O
I O
am O
not O
exposed O
to O
such O
temptations O
, O

I O

sure O
I O
should O
not O
be O
able O
to O
resist O
them O

      | O
either O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
But O
though O
any O
one O
who O
had O
seen O
her O
the B-TIME
next I-TIME
half I-TIME
hour I-TIME
might O
have O
fancied O
that O
a O
serious O
|
      | O
thought O
or O
sober O
task O
could O
not O
approach O
her O
, O
neither O
the O
conversation O
nor O
the O
Psalm B-GPE
was O
|
      | O
forgotten O
  O
with O
Herbert B-PERSON
's O
explanatory O
assistance O
, O
she O
not O
only O
found O
the O
Psalm B-GPE
, O
but O
committed O
|
      | O
it O
to O
memory O
  O
and O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
Sunday B-DATE
after O
her O
conversation O
with O
her O
mother O
, O
repeated O
it O
so O
|
      | O
correctly O
and O
prettily O
to O
her O
father O
, O
as O
to O
give O
her O
the O
delight O
of O
his O
caressing O
approbation O
. O
|
      | O
Learning O
correctly O
by O
rote O
was O
always O
her O
greatest O
trial O
, O
for O
her O
vivid O
fancy O
and O
very O
|
      | O
versatile O
powers O
occasioned O
her O
actual O
lessons O
to O
be O
considered O
such O
drudgery O
, O
as O
to O
require O
a O
|
      | O
great O
effort O
on O
her O
part O
to O
retain O
them O
. O
The O
sense O
, O
indeed O
, O
if O
she O
understood O
it O
, O
she O
learned O
|
      | O
quickly O
enough O
  O
but O
she O
preferred O
her O
own O
language O
to O
any O
one O
's O
else O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
had O
|
      | O
some O
difficulty O
in O
making O
her O
understand O
that O
in O
time O
of O
study O
she O
required O
|
        | O
correctness O
| | O
, O
and O
not O
fancy O
  O
and O
that O
the O
attention O
which O
was O
necessary O
to O
conquer O
the O
|
      | O
words O
as O
well O
as O
the O
sense O
of O
the O
lesson O
, O
was O
much O
more O
important O
and O
valuable O
, O
however O
|
      | O
disagreeable O
it O
might O
seem O
, O
than O
the O
facility O
of O
changing O
the O
language O
to O
something O
prettier O
|
      | O
than O
the O
original O
. O
| 
  | O
When O
, O
therefore O
, O
as O
in O
the O
present O
case O
, O
she O
voluntarily O
undertook O
, O
and O
conquered O
really O
a O
|
      | O
difficult O
task O
for O
a O
little O
lively O
girl O
, O
her O
parents O
had O
no O
scruple O
in O
giving O
the O
only O
reward O
|
      | O
she O
cared O
for O
— O
their O
approbation O
. O
It O
was O
in O
the O
bestowal O
of O
praise O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
was O
compelled O
|
      | O
to O
be O
almost O
painfully O
guarded O
. O
She O
found O
that O
the O
least O
expression O
of O
unusual O
approbation O
|
      | O
caused O
Caroline B-GPE
to O
relax O
in O
her O
efforts O
, O
thinking O
she O
had O
done O
quite O
enough O
, O
and O
perniciously O
|
      | O
increasing O
her O
already O
too O
exalted O
ideas O
of O
herself O
. O
While O
to O
Emmeline B-PERSON
it O
was O
the O
most O
|
      | O
powerful O
incentive O
to O
a O
continuance O
in O
improvement O
, O
and O
determined O
conquest O
of O
her O
faults O
. O
|
      | O
There O
was O
constantly O
a O
dread O
on O
the O
mother O
's O
heart O
, O
that O
Caroline B-GPE
would O
one B-DATE
day I-DATE
accuse O
her O
of O
|
      | O
partiality O
, O
from O
the O
different O
measure O
of O
her O
approbation O
which O
she O
was O
compelled O
to O
bestow O
  O
|
      | O
and O
yet O
painful O
as O
it O
was O
to O
persevere O
under O
such O
an O
impression O
, O
the O
future O
welfare O
of O
both O
|
      | O
was O
too O
precious O
to O
be O
risked O
for O
the O
gratification O
of O
the O
present O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
was O
watching O
with O
delight O
Emmeline B-ORG
's O
unrestrained O
enjoyment O
of O
her O
father O
's O
caresses O
and O
|
      | O
lively O
conversation O
, O
in O
which O
Percy B-PERSON
as O
usual O
joined O
— O
for O
Tiny B-ORG
, O
as O
he O
chose O
to O
call O
her O
, O
was O
his O
|
      | O
especial O
pet O
and O
plaything O
— O
when O
she O
was O
startled O
by O
a O
low O
and O
evidently O
suppressed O
sob O
near O
|
      | O
her O
  O
Ellen B-PERSON
was O
bending O
over O
a O
book O
of O
Bible B-WORK_OF_ART
- O
stories O
which O
Herbert B-PERSON
had O
lent O
her O
, O
and O
her O
long O
|
      | O
ringlets O
completely O
concealed O
her O
face O
  O
Miss O
Harcourt B-PERSON
and O
Caroline B-GPE
both O
looked O
up O
surprised O
, O
|
      | O
but O
a O
rapid O
sign O
from O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
prevented O
their O
making O
any O
remark O
. O
Herbert B-PERSON
fixed O
his O
eyes O
|
      | O
pityingly O
on O
his O
little O
cousin O
as O
if O
wishing O
but O
not O
liking O
to O
address O
her O
. O
Edward B-PERSON
was O
the O
|
      | O
only B-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
of O
the O
party O
who O
moved O
. O
He O
was O
busily O
engaged O
in O
examining O
a O
large O
Noah B-PERSON
's O
ark O
, O
and O
|
      | O
speculating O
as O
to O
its O
resemblance O
to O
a O
ship O
, O
and O
its O
powers O
of O
floating O
, O
but O
after O
a O
few O
|
      | O
minutes B-TIME
' O
apparent O
thought O
he O
left O
it O
, O
and O
sitting O
down O
on O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
chair O
, O
put O
his O
arm O
round O
|
      | O
her O
, O
and O
begged O
her O
to O
find O
a O
picture O
of O
Noah B-PERSON
's O
ark O
, O
and O
see O
if O
it O
were O
at O
all O
like O
the O
toy O
. O
|
      | O
Cheered O
by O
his O
affection O
, O
she O
conquered O
with O
a O
strong O
effort O
the O
choking O
in O
her O
throat O
, O
and O
|
      | O
turned O
to O
the O
page O
, O
and O
tried O
to O
sympathize O
in O
his O
wonder O
if O
it O
really O
were O
like O
the O
vessel O
in O
|
      | O
which O
Noah B-PERSON
was O
saved O
, O
and O
where O
he O
could O
have O
put O
all O
the O
animals O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
joined O
them O
, O
|
      | O
and O
without O
taking O
more O
notice O
of O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
very O
pale O
cheeks O
and O
heavy O
eyes O
, O
than O
gently O
to O
put O
|
      | O
back O
the O
thick O
tresses O
that O
seemed O
to O
annoy O
her O
by O
their O
weight O
, O
gave O
them O
so O
much O
interesting O
|
      | O
information O
on O
the O
subject O
, O
and O
so O
delighted O
Edward B-PERSON
with O
allowing O
him O
to O
drag O
down O
several O
|
      | O
books O
from O
the O
library O
to O
find O
out O
all O
they O
said O
about O
it O
, O
that O
two B-TIME
hours I-TIME
slipped O
away O
quite O
|
      | O
unconsciously O
  O
and O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
very O
painful O
feeling O
had O
been O
so O
soothed O
, O
that O
she O
could O
smile O
, O
and O
|
      | O
join O
Emmeline O
in O
making O
all O
the O
animals O
walk O
in O
grand O
procession O
to O
their O
temporary O

      | O
dwelling O
. O
| 
  | O
But O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
did O
not O
forget O
the O
child O
's O
involuntary O
evidence O
of O
suffering O
, O
and O
vainly O
|
      | O
tried O
to O
imagine O
what O
at O
that O

If O

Edward B-PERSON

reply O
: O
" O
she O
has O
always O
looked O
and O
seemed O
sad O
, O
as O
long O
as O
I O

      | O
can O
remember O
her O
. O
One B-CARDINAL
reason O
may O
be O
, O
she O
was O
always O
ill O
in O
India B-GPE
, O
and O
papa O
was O
often O
telling O
|
      | O
me O
how O
very O
much O
she O
suffered O
, O
and O
how O
patiently O
she O
bore O
it O
  O
and O
then O
, O
too O
, O
she O
knew O
I O
was O
|
      | O
poor O
mamma O
's O
favorite O
, O
( O
his O
voice O
trembled O
) O
, O
and O
that O
used O
to O
make O
her O
very O
unhappy O
  O
but O
I O
do O
|
      | O
not O
know O
why O
she O
is O
so O
very O
sad O
now O
, O
unless O
she O
is O
ill O
again O
, O
and O
that O
no O
one O
can O
tell O
, O
for O
|
      | O
she O
never O
will O
complain O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Was O
your O
sister O
such O
a O
constant O
sufferer O
then O
? O
" O
inquired O
his O
aunt O

" O
Come O
here O
, O

tell O
me O

      | O
all O
you O

about O
her O
Edward B-PERSON

I O
wish O

could O
know O
more O
about O
both O

India B-GPE
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
with O
eager O
willingness O
, O
communicated O
all O
he O
knew O
, O
though O
, O
from O
his O
being O
so O
|
      | O
constantly O
with O
his O
mother O
, O
and O
Ellen B-PERSON
so O
much O
left O
with O
her O
father O
and O
herself O
, O
that O
all O
was O
|
      | O
little O
enough O
  O
adding O
, O
however O
, O
that O
after O
her O
very O
dangerous O
illness O
, O
when O
she O
was O
eight B-DATE
|
      | I-DATE
years I-DATE
old I-DATE
, O
he O
perfectly O
well O
remembered O
hearing O
some O
celebrated O
physician O
say O
to O
his O
father O
|
      | O
she O
would O
probably O
feel O
the O
effects O
of O
it O
all O
her O
life O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
It O
was O
a O
very O
long O
time O
before O
mamma O
permitted O
me O
to O
see O
her O
, O
" O
added O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
" O
and O
when O
I O

      | O
did O
, O
I O
remember O
being O
almost O
frightened O
, O
she O
was O
so O
altered O
, O
so O
pale O
, O
and O
thin O
, O
and O
weak O
  O
and O
|
      | O
then O
she O
was O
very O
ill O
after O
poor O
papa O
's O
death O
  O
but O
since O
then O
she O
has O
never O
complained O
, O
and O
|
      | O
never O
kept O
her O
bed O
  O
but O
I O
know O
she O
is O
often O
in O
pain O
, O
for O
when O
I O
have O
touched O
her O
forehead O
|
      | O
sometimes O
, O
it O
has O
burnt O
my O
hand O
like O
fire O
. O
" O

  | O
This O
childish O
explanation O
certainly O
told O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
more O
than O
she O
had O
known O
before O
  O
but O
|
      | O
that O
Ellen B-PERSON
had O
witnessed O
the O
fearful O
scene O
of O
her O
father O
's O
death O
was O
still O
concealed O

Edward B-PERSON
, O

      | O
as O
he O
grew O
older O
, O
though O
he O
did O
not O
know O
why O
, O
seemed O
to O
shrink O
from O
the O
subject O
, O
particularly O

      | O
that O
he O
had O
been O
at O
a O
ball O
the O
same O
awful O
night O

A B-DATE
few I-DATE

afterward O
, O
as O

crossing O
the O
large O
hall O
on O
her O
way O
to O

school O

of O

determination O
that O

receive O
the O

already O

in O

against O

she O

instantly O

ill O

when O
you O

are O
so O
good O

so O
kind O

head O
ached O

- O
day O

that O
always O

indeed O

  O
" O

, O
as O
if O
frightened O
at O
her O
own O
confession O

she O
hid O
her O
face O
in O

      | O
her O

  | O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
lifted O
her O
into O
her O
lap O

kissed O
her O
without O
speaking O

" O
You O
must O
learn O
to O
love O
me O
more O

more O
then O

my O
Ellen B-PERSON

she O
said O
, O
after O
a O
pause O
, O
" O

when O

      | O
you O
are O
feeling O
ill O

in O
pain O

you O
must O
not O

afraid O

tell O
me O

I O
shall O
think O
that O
you O

only O
fancy O
you O
love O

no O

it O

my O

good O

papa O
! O
" O
the O
word O
was O
almost O
choked O
with O
sobs O
. O
" O
He O
used O
to O
fondle O
me O

praise O
me O

call O
me O

      | O
his O
darling O

Emmeline B-ORG
last B-DATE
Sunday I-DATE
  O
and O
when O
I O
was O
ill O
, O
so O
ill O
they O

      | O
said O
I O
should O
die O

he O
never O
left O
me O

when O
his O
military O
duties O
called O
him O
away O
  O
and O
he O
|
      | O
used O
to O
nurse O
me O
, O
and O
try O
to O
amuse O
me O
, O
that O
I O
might O
forget O
pain O
and O
weakness O
. O
Oh O
, O
I O
shall O
|
      | O
never O
, O
never O
forget O
that O
dreadful O
night O
! O
" O
and O
she O
closed O
her O
eyes O
and O
shuddered O
, O
as O
the O
horrid O
|
      | O
scene O
of O
blood O
and O
death O
flashed O
before O
her O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
What O
dreadful O
night O
my O
poor O
child O
? O
" O
inquired O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
soothingly O
, O
after O
doubting O
|
      | O
whether O
or O
not O
it O
would O
be O
better O
for O
Ellen B-PERSON
to O
pursue O
such O
an O
evidently O
painful O
theme O
, O
and O
no O
|
      | O
longer O
requiring O
an O
explanation O
of O
her O
emotion O
the O
previous O
Sabbath B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
" O
The O
night O
poor O
papa O
was O
killed —oh B-PERSON
, O
there O
were O
so O
many O
horrid O
forms O
on O
the O
grass O
, O
the O
|
      | O
natives O
and O
poor O
papa O
's O
own O
men O
, O
and O
they O
looked O
so O
ghastly O
in O
the O
moonlight O
, O
and O
the O
grass O
|
      | O
was O
covered O
with O
blood O
and O
limbs O
and O
heads O
that O
had O
been O
shot O
off O
  O
and O
there O
were O
such O
cries O
|
      | O
and O
groans O
of O
pain O
— O
I O
see O
it O
, O
I O
hear O
it O
all O
again O
so O
often O
before O
I O
go O
to O
sleep O
, O
and O
when O
my O
|
      | O
head O
feels O
as O
it O
does O
to O
- O
day O
, O
and O
fancy O
I O
hear O
poor O
papa O
's O
last O
words O
and O
feel O
his O
kiss O
as O
he O
|
      | O
lay O
bleeding O
, O
bleeding O
slowly O
to O
death O
and O
his O
voice O
was O
so O
strange O
, O
and O
his O
lips O
so O
|
      | O
cold O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
But O
how O
came O
you O
in O
such O
a O
dreadful O
scene O
, O
my O
poor O
Ellen B-PERSON
? O
who O
could O
have O
permitted O
such O
a O
|
      | O
little O
child O
to O
be O
there O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Because O
I O
wished O
it O
so O
very O
much O
  O
I O
knew O
he O
would O
die O
before O
they O
could O
bring O
him O
to O
me O
, O
|
      | O
and O
I O
did O
so O
want O
to O
feel O
his O
kiss O
and O
hear O
his O
voice O
once O
more O
. O
Oh O
, O
aunt O
Emmeline B-ORG
! O
shall O
I O

      | O
never O
see O
him O
again O
? O
I O
know O
he O
can O
not O
come O
to O
me O
  O
but O
shall O
I O
, O
oh O
, O
shall O
I O
ever O
be O
good O
|
      | O
enough O
to O
go O
to O
him O
? O
" O
And O
she O
looked O
up O
in O
her O
aunt O
's O
face O
with O
such O
a O
countenance O
of O
|
      | O
beseeching O
entreaty O
, O
that O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
's O
eyes O
filled O
with O
tears O
, O
and O
it O
was O
a O
full O
minute O
|
      | O
before O
she O
could O
speak O
  O
but O
when O
she O
did O
, O
Ellen B-PERSON
felt O
more O
relieved O
and O
comforted O
, O
than O
on O
the O
|
      | O
subject O
of O
her O
father O
's O
death O
she O
had O
ever O
felt O
before O
. O
From O
her O
mother O
not O
being O
able O
to O
bear O
|
      | O
the O
subject O
even O
partially O
alluded O
to O
, O
and O
from O
having O
no O
one O
to O
whom O
she O
could O
speak O
of O
it O
, O
|
      | O
it O
had O
taken O
a O
still O
stronger O
hold O
of O
her O
imagination O
  O
and O
whenever O
she O
was O
unusually O
weak O
, O
|
      | O
and O
her O
head O
aching O
and O
confused O
, O
it O
became O
still O
more O
vivid O
. O
The O
very O
visible O
sympathy O
and O
|
      | O
interest O
of O
her O
aunt O
, O
and O
the O
gentle O
words O
in O
which O
she O
tried O
to O
turn O
the O
child O
's O
thoughts O
|
      | O
from O
that O
scene O
of O
horror O
to O
the O
happiness O
of O
her O
father O
in O
Heaven O
, O
and O
an O
assurance O
that O
, O
if O
|
      | O
she O
tried O
to O
do O
her O
duty O
, O
and O
to O
love O
and O
serve O
God O

and O
trust O
in O
His O
mercy O
to O
render O
her O
|
      | O
efforts O
acceptable O
, O
she O
would O
rejoin O
him O
, O
seemed O
to O
remove O
the O
mass O
of O
tangled O
thought O
within O
|
      | O
her O
young O
mind O
. O
Her O
head O
, O
indeed O
, O
still O
ached O
very O
painfully O
, O
and O
her O
eyes O
seemed O
as O
if O
they O

      | O
would O
close O
, O
notwithstanding O
all O
her O
efforts O
to O
keep O
them O
open O
  O
but O
when O
she O
awoke O
from O
a O
long O

      | O
quiet O
sleep O
, O
on O
the O
sofa O
in O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON

dressing O

room O
, O
where O
her O
aunt O
had O
laid O
her O
, O
and O
|
      | O
found O
that O
kind O
friend O
still O
watching O
over O
her O
, O
the O
little O
heart O
and O
temples O
had O
ceased O
to O
|
      | O
throb O
so O
quickly O
, O
and O
she O
felt O
better O
and O
happier O
. O
| 
  | O
Mr. O
Maitland B-PERSON
, O
the O
medical O
friend O
of O
the O
family O

confirmed O
the O
opinion O
which O
Edward B-PERSON
had O
said O

      | O
their O
physician O
in O
India B-GPE
had O
given O
of O
his O
sister O
's O
state O
of O
health O
. O
He O
did O
not O
, O
he O
said O
, O
|
      | O
consider O
her O
liable O
to O
serious O
illness O
, O
or O
of O
a O
constitution O
that O
would O
not O
endure O
  O
but O
that O
|
      | O
he O
feared O
it O
would O
be O
some B-DATE
years I-DATE
before O
she O
knew O
the O
blessing O
of O
really O
good O
health O
, O
and O
be O
|
      | O
constantly O
subject O
to O
that O
lassitude O
, O
severe O
headache O
, O
and O
the O
depression O
of O
the O
whole O
system O
|
      | O
thence O
proceeding O
, O
which O
must O
prevent O
the O
liveliness O
and O
quickness O
of O
acquirement O
natural O
to O
|
      | O
most O
children O
. O
He O
thought O
the O
evil O
had O
been O
very O
greatly O
increased O
by O
want O
of O
sufficient O
care O
|
      | O
in O
early B-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
and O
the O
unwholesome O
climate O
in O
which O
she O
had O
so O
long O
lived O
, O
that O
he O
wondered O
|
      | O
her O
mother O
had O
not O
been O
advised O
to O
send O
her O
over O
to O
England B-GPE
, O
adding O
, O
with O
a O
smile O
, O
he O
was O
|
      | O
quite O
sure O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
would O
not O
have O
refused O
the O
charge O
, O
anxious O
as O
it O
might O
have O
been O
. O
And O

      | O
earnestly O
, O
not O
only O
on O
account O
of O
the O
child O
's O
physical O
but O
mental O
health O
, O
did O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON

      | O
wish O
that O
such O
had O
been O
the O
case O
, O
and O
that O
she O
had O
had O
the O
care O
of O
her O
niece O
from O
earliest O
|
      | O
infancy O
  O
and O
how O
much O
more O
would O
she O
have O
wished O
this O
, O
had O
she O
known O
that O
Mrs. O
Fortescue B-PERSON
had O

      | O
really O
been O
advised O
to O
do O
with O
Ellen B-PERSON
as O
Mr. O
Maitland B-PERSON
had O
said O
, O
but O
that O
believing O
it O
merely O
an O

      | O
idle O
fancy O

and O
persisting O
, O
too O
, O
in O
her O

headstrong O
idea O

that O
it O
was O
ill O

temper O

not O

      | O
illness O

which O
rendered O
Ellen B-PRODUCT
so O
disagreeable O

she O
would O
not O
stoop O
so O
to O
conquer O
her O

      | O
unfortunate O
pride O
as O
to O
ask O
such O
a O
favor O
of O
her O

to O
whom O
else O
could O
she O
appeal O

|
      | O
Colonel O
Fortescue O
had O
none O
but O
distant O
cousins O

She O
did O
satisfy O
a O
qualm O
of O
conscience O
by O
once O

      | O
suggesting O
to O
her O
husband O
— O
as O
her O
own O
idea O
, O
however O
, O
not O
as O
that O
of O
an O
experienced O
|
      | O
physician O
— O
that O
as O
he O
fancied O
Ellen B-PERSON
was O
always O
ill O
, O
she O
might O
be O
better O
in O
England B-GPE
  O
but O
, O
as O
she O

      | O
expected O
, O
not O
only O
his O
intense O
love O
for O
his O
little O
girl O
rose O
up O
against O
the O
idea O
of O

      | O
separation O
, O
but O
his O
pride O
revolted O
from O
sending O
her O
to O
claim O
the O
pity O
of O
relatives O
who O
had O
so O
|
      | O
completely O
cast O
off O
her O
parents O
: O
yet O
had O
he O
been O
told O
it O
was O
absolutely O
necessary O
for O
her O

      | O
health O

so O
greatly O
for O
her O
happiness O

he O
would O
not O
have O
hesitated O
to O
sacrifice O
every O

the O

Mrs. O

could O
not O
so O
govern O
her O

to O

the O

toward O
Ellen B-PERSON
as O
she O
did O
toward O
Edward B-PERSON

the O
children O
she O
had O
lived O
with O
and O
|
      | O
taught O
so O
long O
. O
Her O
task O
with O
Ellen B-PERSON
required O
more O
patience O

forbearance O

care O
than O
with O

      | O
either O
of O

and O
sometimes O
she O
could O
not O
help O
believing O

acting O
toward O
her O
as O
if O

      | O
it O
were O
willful O
idleness O

the O

With O
the O
recollection O
and O
evidence O
of O
Herbert B-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
been O
delicate O
from O
his O
birth O
, O
and O
who O
|
      | O
was O
yet O
of O
such O
a O
remarkably O
gifted O
mind O
, O
and O
so O
bright O
in O
aspect O
, O
so O
sweet O
in O
temper O
, O
that O
|
      | O
illness O
seemed O
to O
have O
spiritualized O
instead O
of O
deadened O
every O
faculty O
, O
she O
could O
not O
|
      | O
understand O
, O
as O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
did O
, O
the O
force O
of O
circumstances O
in O
producing O
from O
nearly O
the O
same O
|
      | O
cause O
two B-CARDINAL
much O
different O
effects O
, O
nor O
how O
it O
was O
that O
complete O
neglect O
had O
engendered O
more O
|
      | O
evils O
than O
indiscreet O
indulgence O
  O
but O
that O
it O
appeared O
to O
have O
done O
so O
, O
was O
unhappily O
only O
too O
|
      | O
evident O
not O
only O
to O
Miss O
Harcourt B-PERSON
but O
to O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
. O
It O
seemed O
almost O
surprising O
, O
and O
|
      | O
certainly O
a O
proof O
of O
a O
remarkably O
good O
disposition O
, O
that O
Edward B-PERSON
appeared O
so O
free O
from O
great O
|
      | O
faults O
, O
and O
of O
such O
a O
warm O
, O
generous O
, O
frank O
, O
and O

seemingly O
|  | O
unselfish O
nature O
, O
so O
open O
|
      | O
to O
conviction O
and O
to O
all O
good O
impressions O
, O
that O
, O
except O
occasional O
fits O
of O
violent O
passion O
, O
|
      | O
there O
really O
was O
, O
as O
far O
as O
his O
aunt O
and O
uncle O
could O
perceive O
, O
nothing O
to O
complain O
of O
. O
They O
|
      | O
did O
not O
know O
that O
he O
stood O
in O
such O
awe O
of O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
from O
his O
mother O
's O
lessons O
of O
his O
|
      | O
exceeding O
sternness O
, O
that O
he O
exercised O
the O
greatest O
control O
over O
himself O
  O
and O
he O
was O
so O
|
      | O
excessively O
fond O
of O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
, O
and O
his O
days O
glided O
by O
in O
such O
varied O
and O
delightful O
|
      | O
employment O
, O
that O
there O
was O
no O
temptation O
to O
do O
wrong O
, O
except O
certain O
acts O
of O
trifling O
|
      | O
disobedience O
, O
of O
more O
consequence O
from O
the O
self O
- O
will O
they O
betrayed O
than O
the O
acts O
themselves O
, O
|
      | O
but O
which O
might O
have O
been O
sources O
of O
anxiety O
to O
his O
aunt O
, O
and O
lessened O
her O
confidence O
in O
him O
|
      | O
had O
she O
known O
them O
  O
but O
she O
did O
not O
, O
for O
Ellen B-PERSON
not O
only O
constantly O
concealed O
, O
but O
she O
was O
the O
|
      | O
sufferer O
for O
him O
, O
and O
so O
brought O
reproof O
and O
suspicion O
on O
herself O
, O
which O
, O
could O
the O
truth O
have O
|
      | O
been O
known O
, O
might O
have O
been O
averted O
. O
But O
truth O
of O
act O
as O
well O
as O
word O
had O
never O
been O
impressed O
|
      | O
on O
Edward B-PERSON
  O
and O
, O
therefore O
, O
though O
he O
was O
constitutionally O
too O
brave O
to O
utter O
a O
falsehood O
, O
too O
|
      | O
honorable O
to O
shield O
himself O
at O
the O
expense O
of O
another O
, O
if O
he O
knew O
that O
other O
suffered O
, O
he O
had O
|
      | O
been O
too O
long O
taught O
to O
believe O
that O
Ellen B-PERSON
was O
his O
inferior O
, O
and O
must O
always O
give O
up O
to O
him O
, O
|
      | O
to O
imagine O
that O
he O
was O
even O
acting O
deceitfully O
or O
unmanfully O
in O
permitting O
her O
to O
conceal O
his O
|
      | O
acts O
of O
disobedience O
. O
| 
  | O
There O
was O
so O
much O
to O
love O
and O
admire O
in O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
that O
neither O
Mr. O
nor O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
imagined O
|
      | O
the O
real O
weakness O
of O
his O
character O
— O
that O
those O
lovable O
qualities O
all O
sprung O
from O
natural O
|
      | O
impulse O
, O
unsustained O
by O
any O
thing O
like O
principle O
. O
The O
quickness O
and O
apparent O
fervor O
with O
which O
|
      | O
he O
received O
the O
religious O
impressions O
they O
and O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
sought O
so O
earnestly O
to O
instill O
in O
|
      | O
the O
short O
time O
that O
was O
allowed O
them O
before O
he O
entered O
the O
navy O
, O
they O
augured O
so O
hopefully O
|
      | O
from O
, O
that O
not O
only O
his O
preceptor O
and O
uncle O
, O
but O
his O
ever O
anxious O
aunt O
, O
looked O
forward O
to O
his O
|
      | O
career O
with O
scarcely O
a O
doubt O
as O
to O
its O
probity O
and O
honor O
. O
| 
  | O
Ellen B-PERSON
caused O
her O
infinitely O
more O
anxiety O
. O
There O
was O
a O
disregard O
to O
truth O
, O
a O
want O
of O
openness O
|
      | O
and O
candor O
, O
which O
, O
though O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
believed O
the O
effects O
of O
neglect O
and O
extreme O
timidity O
, O
|
      | O
both O
her O
husband O
and O
Miss O
Harcourt B-PERSON
feared O
were O
natural O
. O
Much O
, O
indeed O
, O
sprung O
from O
the O
poor O
|
      | O
child O
's O
mistaken O
idea O
of O
the O
nature O
and O
solemnity O
of O
the O
promise O
she O
had O
made O
her O
mother O

and O

      | O
her O
constant O
watchfulness O
and O
determination O
to O
shield O

. O
For O
the O
disregard O
to O
truth O
, O
her O
|
      | O
mother O
had O
, O
indeed O
, O
alone O
been O
answerable O
. O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
naturally O
very O
timid O
character O
required O
the O

      | O
inculcation O
of O
a O
high O
, O
firm O
principle O
, O
to O
enable O
her O
so O
to O
conquer O
herself O
as O
to O
speak O
the O
|
      | O
truth O
, O
even O
if O
she O

it O

extreme O
cases O

      | O

angry O
at O
the O
delay O

fearing O
that O
his O

would O
not O
wait O
for O
him O

he O
worked O

      | O
himself O
into O
such O
a O
violent O
passion O
, O
that O
when O
Robert B-PERSON
did O
appear O
he O
gave O
vent O
to O
more O
abusive O

      | O
language O

he O
had O
ever O

ventured O
to O

by O
hurling O
both O

discarded O

      | O
at O
the O

only O
escaped O

most O
unexpected O
interference O

      | O
Edward B-PERSON
so O
started O
at O
her O
voice O

never O

Edward B-PERSON
leave O
her O
presence O
more O
gladly O

Shame O
had O
suddenly O
conquered O
anger O
  O

      | O
though O
his O
chest O
still O
heaved O
and O
his O
cheeks O
were O
still O
flushed O

nearly B-DATE
a I-DATE
quarter I-DATE

a O

Twice O
he O

up O

his O
aunt O

face O
as O
if O

      | O
about O
to O
speak O

the O
expression O
was O
so O
very O
grave O
, O
that O
he O
felt O
strangely O
afraid O
to O

      | O
proceed O

At O
length O
he O
exclaimed O
— O

are O
displeased O

" O

I O
will O
ask O
Robert B-PERSON

pardon O
the O
moment O

go O

home O

not O

my O
arguments O
can O
convince O
you O

your O
error O

only O

pardon O
for O

Edward B-PERSON
unhesitatingly O

" O

" O
And O
why O
not O

" O

mine O

not O

thinking O
how O
very O
far O
superior O

      | O
was O
Robert B-PERSON
, O
a O
poor O
country O
youth O

the O
young O
gentleman O

The O
color O
rose O
to O
Edward B-PERSON

temples O
, O
but O
he O
set O
his O
teeth O

clenched O
his O
hand O
, O
to O
prevent O

      | O
any O
farther O
display O
of O
anger O
  O
and O
his O
aunt O
, O
after O
attentively O
observing O
him O
, O
continued O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
He O
said O
that O
his O
young O
master O

never O
required O

often O

in O
what O
can O
he O
be O
my O
superior O

" O
asked O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
low O
voice O
, O
as O
if O
still O
afraid O
his O

      | O
passion O
would O
regain O
ascendency O

" O
I O
will O
answer O
your O
question O
by O
another O
, O
Edward B-PERSON

Suppose O
any O
one O
had O
used O
abusive O
terms O

      | O
toward O
you O
, O
and O
contemptuously O
desired O
you O
to O
get O
out O
of O
their O
sight O

how O
would O
you O
have O

" O
I O
would O

struck O
him O

Edward B-PERSON

passionately O
, O

quite O
forgetting O

" O
And O
what O
prevented O

" O

  | O
" O
Yes O
, O
" O
replied O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
blushing O
deeply O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
And O
yet O
you O
successfully O
checked O
your O
rising O
passion O
, O
for O
fear O
of O
offending O
me O
. O
I O
can O
not O
|
      | O
be O
always O
near O
you O
  O
but O
, O
my O
dear O
boy O
, O
you O
must O
endeavor O
to O
remember O
that O
lesson O
I O
have O
tried O
|
      | O
to O
teach O
you O
so O
often O
— O
that O
you O
are O
never O
|  | O
alone O
| | O
. O
You O
can O
not O
even O
think O
an O
angry O
|
      | O
thought O
, O
much O
less O
speak O
an O
abusive O
word O
and O
commit O
the O
most O
trifling O
act O
of O
passion O
, O
without O
|
      | O
offending O
God O
. O
If O
you O
would O
but O
ask O
for O
His O
help O
, O
and O
recollect O
that O
to O
offend O
Him O
is O
far O
more O
|
      | O
terrible O
than O
to O
incur O
the O
displeasure O
of O
either O
your O
uncle O
or O
myself O
, O
I O
think O
you O
would O
find O
|
      | O
your O
task O
much O
easier O
, O
than O
if O
you O
attempted O
it O
, O
trusting O
in O
your O
own O
strength O
alone O
, O
and O
only O
|
      | O
for O
fear O
of O
man O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Edward B-PERSON
did O
not O
make O
any O
reply O
, O
but O
his O
countenance O
expressed O
such O
earnest O
thought O
and O
|
      | O
softened O
feeling O
, O
that O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
determined O
on O
not O
interrupting O
it O
by O
calling O
at O
Moorlands B-GPE

      | O
as O
she O

intended O

so O
turned O

They O
walked O
on O

some O

      | O
little O
time O
in O
silence O

gradually O
ascending O
one O

green O

      | O
flowery O

on O
reaching O
the O
summit O

pausing O
a O

      | O
moment O
by O
the O
little O
gate O

opened O
on O
a O
rich O
meadow O

through O
which O
their O
path O
lay O
, O
an O

      | O
exclamation O

lately O

there O

both O

beautifully O
with O
the O
limpid O
waters O
, O
whose O
deep O

      | O
azure O
seemed O
to O
mock O
the O
very O

The O
Dart O
from O
that O
point O
seemed O
no O
longer O
a O
meandering O

      | O
river O
: O
it O
was O
so O
encompassed O
by O
thick O
woods O
and O
fertile O
hills O
that O
it O
resembled O
a O
lake O

there O
was O
neither O
outlet O

from O

The O
trees O
all O
presented O
that O

      | O
exquisite O
variety O
of O
green O
peculiar O
to O
May B-DATE
, O
and O
so O
lofty O
was O
the O
slope O
on O
which O
they O
grew O
, O

      | O
that O
some O
seemed O
to O
touch O
the O
very O
sky O

others O
bent O
gracefully O
over O
the O
water O

which O

      | O
their O
thick O
branches O
nearly O
touched O

the O

beech O

would O
start O
up O

of O
growth O
so O

already O
shorn O
off O

Some O
parts O
of O

in O
complete O
shade O
from O
the O
overhanging O
branches O

beyond O

the O

in O
other O

a O
stray O

would O
dart O

shine O

darkness O
  O

farther O
on O

the O
cloudless O
sun O
so O
flung O
down O
his O
full O
refulgence O

that O
the O
moving O

know O

my O

very O
sad O

you O

" O

There O
was O
so O
much O
in O
this O
reply O
to O
surprise O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
it O
seemed O
so O
to O
fill O
his O
mind O
with O
new O

      | O
ideas O
, O
that O
he O
continued O
his O

absolute O
silence O

That O
his O
aunt O
could O
ever O

she O

to O
say O
she O
had O

did O

and O
even O
still O
at O
times O
found O
it O
difficult O

do O
right O

was O

      | O
very O
strange O
  O
but O
yet O
somehow O
it O
seemed O
to O
comfort O
him O

to O
inspire O
him O
with O
a O
sort O
of O

      | O
courage O
to O
emulate O
her O

conquer O
his O
difficulties O

He O
had O
fancied O

not O

      | O
possibly O
understand O
how O
difficult O
it O
was O
for O
him O
always O
to O
be O
good O
  O

when O
he O
found O
that O
she O

could O
do O
so O
even O
from O
her O
own O
experience O

somewhat O

her O

the O
half O

saw O
poor O

earnestly O

      | O
comfort O

evidently O
without O
success O
  O

Mary B-PERSON
was O
in O
general O
so O
controlled O
, O
that O
her O

      | O
present O
grief O
betrayed O
some O

and O
then O
to O
try O
and O
tell O
her O
what O
had O
occurred O
. O
It O
was O
a O
very O
sad O
tale O
for O
a O
child O
to O
tell O
, O
|
      | O
and O
as O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
's O
previous O
knowledge O
enabled O
her O
to O
gather O
more O
from O
it O
than O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
|
      | O
broken O
narrative O
permitted O
, O
we O
will O
give O
it O
in O
our O
own O
words O
. O

  | O
Mr. O
Greville B-PERSON
had O
been O
at O
home O
for O
a B-DATE
month I-DATE
, O
a B-CARDINAL
quarter I-CARDINAL
of O
which O
time O
the O
good O
humor O
which O
some O
|
      | O
unusually O
successful O
bets O
had O
excited O
, O
lasted O
  O
but O
no O
longer O
. O
His O
amusement O
then O
consisted O
, O
as O
|
      | O
usual O
, O
in O
trying O
every O
method O
to O
annoy O
and O
irritate O
his O
wife O
, O
and O
in O
endeavoring O
to O
make O
his O
|
      | O
son O
exactly O
like O
himself O
. O
Young O
as O
the O
boy O
was O
— O
scarcely O
twelve B-CARDINAL
— O
he O
took O
him O
to O
scenes O
of O
riot O
|
      | O
and O
feasting O
, O
which O
the O
society O
of O
some O
boon O
companions O
, O
unhappily O
near O
neighbors O
, O
permitted O
  O
|
      | O
and O
though O
Alfred B-ORG
's O
cheek O
became O
pale O
, O
his O
eye O
haggard O
, O
and O
his O
temper O
uneven O
, O
his O
initiation O
|
      | O
was O
fraught O
with O
such O
a O
new O
species O
of O
excitement O
and O
pleasure O
, O
that O
it O
rejoiced O
and O
|
      | O
encouraged O
his O
father O
in O
the O
same O
measure O
as O
it O
agonized O
his O
mother O
, O
and O
, O
for O
her O
sake O
, O
poor O
|
      | O
Mary B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
That O
morning O
Alfred B-PERSON
had O
declared O
his O
intention O
of O
visiting O
a O
large O
fair O
, O
which O
, O
with O
some O
|
      | O
races O
of O
but O
ill O
repute O
, O
from O
the O
bad O
company O
they O
collected O
, O
was O
to O
be O
held O
at O
a O
neighboring O
|
      | O
town O
, O
and O
told O
his O
father O
to O
prepare O
for O
a O
large O
demand O
on O
his O
cash O
, O
as O
he O
meant O
to O
try O
his O
|
      | O
hand O
at O
all O
the O
varieties O
of O
gaming O
which O
the O
scene O
presented O
. O
Mr. O
Greville B-PERSON
laughed O
heartily O
|
      | O
at O
what O
he O
called O
the O
boy O
's O
right O
spirit O
, O
and O
promised O
him O
all O
he O
required O
  O
but O
there O
was O
a O
|
      | O
quivering O
on O
her O
mother O
's O
lip O
, O
a O
deadly O
paleness O
on O
her O
cheek O
, O
that O
spoke O
volumes O
of O
suffering O
|
      | O
to O
the O
heart O
of O
the O
observant O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
who O
sat O
trembling O
beside O
her O
. O
Still O
Mrs. O
Greville B-PERSON
did O
not O
|
      | O
speak O
till O
her O
husband O
left O
the O
room O
  O
but O
then O
, O
as O
Alfred B-ORG
was O
about O
to O
follow O
him O
, O
she O
caught O
|
      | O
hold O
of O
his O
hand O
, O
and O
implored O
him O
, O
with O
such O
a O
tone O
and O
look O
of O
agony O
, O
only O
to O
listen O
to O
her O
, O
|
      | O
for O
her O
sake O
to O
give O
up O
his O
intended O
pleasure O
  O
that O
, O
almost O
frightened O
by O
an O
emotion O
which O
in O
|
      | O
his O
gentle O
mother O
he O
had O
scarcely O
ever O
seen O
, O
and O
suddenly O
remembering O
that O
he O
had O
lately O
been O
|
      | O
indeed O
most O
unkind O
and O
neglectful O
to O
her O
, O
he O
threw O
his O
arms O
round O
her O
neck O
, O
and O
promised O
with O
|
      | O
tears O
that O
if O
it O
gave O
her O
so O
much O
pain O
, O
he O
would O
not O
go O
  O
and O
so O
sincere O
was O
his O
feeling O
at O
the O
|
      | O
moment O
that O
, O
had O
there O
been O
no O
tempter O
near O
, O
he O
would O
, O
in O
all O
probability O
, O
have O
kept O
his O
word O
. O
|
      | O
But O
the O
moment O
Mr. O
Greville B-PERSON
heard O
from O
his O
son O
his O
change O
of O
intention O
and O
its O
cause O
, O
he O
so O
|
      | O
laughed O
at O
his O
ridiculous O
folly O
, O
so O
sneered O
at O
his O
want O
of O
spirit O
in O
preferring O
his O
mother O
's O
|
      | O
whims O
to O
his O
father O
's O
pleasures O
, O
that O
, O
as O
could O
not O
fail O
to O
be O
the O
case O
, O
every O
better O
feeling O
|
      | O
fled O
. O
This O
ought O
to O
have O
been O
enough O
  O
but O
it O
was O
too O
good O
an O
opportunity O
to O
vent O
his O
|
      | O
ill O
- O
temper O
on O
his O
wife O
, O
to O
be O
neglected O
. O
He O
sought O
her O
, O
where O
she O
was O
superintending O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
|
      | O
lessons O
, O
and O
for O
nearly B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour I-TIME
poured O
upon O
her O
the O
most O
fearful O
abuse O
and O
cutting O
taunts O
, O
|
      | O
ending O
by O
declaring O
that O
all O
the O
good O
she O
had O
done O
by O
her O
saintly O
eloquence O
was O
to O
banish O
her O
|
      | O
son O
from O
her O
presence O
, O
whenever O
he O
left O
home O
, O
as O
in O
future O
Alfred B-ORG
should O
be O
his O
companion O
  O
and O
|
      | O
that O
he O
should O
begin O
that O
very O
day O
. O
Mrs. O
Greville B-PERSON
neither O
moved O
nor O
spoke O
in O
reply O
  O
and O
the O
|
      | O
expression O
of O
her O
countenance O
was O
so O
sternly O
calm O
, O
that O
poor O
Mary B-PERSON
felt O
as O
if O
she O
dared O
not O
|
      | O
give O
way O
to O
the O
emotion O
with O
which O
her O
heart O
was O
bursting O
. O
| 
  | O
Mr. O
Greville B-PERSON
left O
the O
room O
, O
and O
they O
heard O
him O
peremptorily O
desire O
the O
housekeeper O
to O
put O
up O
|
      | O
some O
of O
Master O
Alfred B-PERSON
's O
clothes O
. O
In O
a O
perfectly O
composed O
voice O
Mrs. O
Greville B-PERSON
desired O
Mary B-PERSON
to O
|
      | O
proceed O
with O
the O
exercise O
she O
was O
writing O
, O
and O
emulating O
her O
firmness O
, O
she O
tried O
to O
obey O
. O
|
      | O
Fortunately O
her O
task O
was O
writing O
, O
for O
to O
have O
spoken O
or O
read O
aloud O
would O
, O
she O
felt O
, O
have O
been O
|
      | O
impossible O
. O
So O
full B-TIME
half I-TIME
an I-TIME
hour I-TIME
passed O
, O
and O
then O
hasty O
footsteps O
were O
heard O
in O
the O
hall O
, O
and O
|
      | O
the O
joyous O
voice O
of O
Alfred B-ORG
exclaiming O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
Let O
me O
wish O
mamma O
and O
Mary B-PERSON
good O
- O
by O
, O
papa O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
have O
not O
another O
moment O
to O
spare O
, O
" O
was O
the O
reply O
. O
" O
You O
have O
kept O
me O
long O
enough O
, O
and O
must O
|
      | O
be O
quicker O
next O
time O
  O
come O
along O
, O
my O
boy O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
The O
rapid O
tread O
of O
horses O
' O
hoofs O
speedily O
followed O
the O
sullen O
clang O
with O
which O
the O
hall O
- O
door O
|
      | O
closed O
, O
and O
as O
rapidly O
faded O
away O
in O
the O
distance O
. O
With O
an O
irresistible O
impulse O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
raised O
|
      | O
her O
eyes O
to O
her O
mother O
's O
face O
  O
a O
bright O
red O
flush O
had O
risen O
to O
her O
temples O
, O
but O
her O
lips O
were O
|
      | O
perfectly O
colorless O
, O
and O
her O
hand O
tightly O
pressed O
her O
heart O
  O
but O
this O
only O
lasted O
a B-TIME
minute I-TIME
, O
|
      | O
for O
the O
next O
she O
had O
fallen O
quite O
senseless O
on O
the O
floor O
. O
Her O
poor O
child O
hung O
over O
her O
almost O
|
      | O
paralyzed O
with O
terror O
, O
and O
so O
long O
did O
the O
faint O
last O
, O
that O
she O
was O
conveyed O
to O
her O
own O
room O
, O
|
      | O
partially O
undressed O
, O
and O
laid O
on O
her O
bed O
before O
she O
at O
all O
recovered O
. O
A O
brief O
while O
she O
had O
|
      | O
clasped O
Mary B-PERSON
to O
her O
bosom O
, O
as O
if O
in O
her O
was O
indeed O
her O
only O
earthly O
comfort O
, O
and O
then O
in O
a O
|
      | O
faint O
voice O
desired O
to O
be O
left O
quite O
alone O
. O
Mary B-PERSON
had O
flung O
herself O
on O
the O
neck O
of O
the O
|
      | O
sympathizing O
Herbert B-PERSON
Hamilton I-PERSON
( O
who O
had O
arrived O
just O
in O
the O
confusion O
attendant O
on O
Mrs. O
|
      | O
Greville B-ORG
's O
unusual O
illness O
) O
, O
and O
wept O
there O
in O
all O
the O
uncontrolled O
violence O
of O
early O

      | O
sorrow O
. O
| 
  | O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
remained O
some O
time O
with O
her O
afflicted O
friend O
, O
for O
so O
truly O
could O
she O
|
      | O
sympathize O
with O
her O
, O
that O
her O
society O
brought O
with O
it O
the O
only O
solace O
Mrs. O
Greville B-PERSON
was O

      | O
capable O
of O
realizing O
from O
human O
companionship O

| 
  | O
" O
It O
is O
not O
for O
myself O
I O
murmur O
, O
" O
were O
the O
only O
words O
that O
in O
that O
painful O
interview O
might O
|
      | O
have O
even O
seemed O
like O
complaint O
  O
" O
but O
for O
my O
poor O
child O

How O
is O
her O
fragile O
frame O

gentle O

      | O
spirit O

endure O
through O
trials O
such O

these O
  O
oh O

Emmeline B-ORG
, O
to O
lose O
both O

through O
their O

      | O
father O

" O

  | O
And O
difficult O
indeed O
did O
it O
seem O
to O
realize O
the O
cause O
of O
such O
a O
terrible O
dispensation O
  O
but O
|
      | O
happily O
for O
Mrs. O
Greville B-PERSON
, O
she O
could O
still O
look O
up O
in O
love O
and O
trust O
, O
even O
when O
below O
all O
of O
|
      | O
comfort O
as O
of O
joy O
seemed O
departed O
  O
and O
in O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
days I-DATE
she O
was O
enabled O
to O
resume O
her O
usual O
|
      | O
avocations O
, O
and O
, O
by O
an O
assumption O
of O
cheerfulness O
and O
constant O
employment O
, O
to O
restore O
some O

      | O
degree O
of O
peace O
and O
happiness O
to O
her O
child O

| 
  | O
Neither B-PERSON
Herbert I-PERSON
nor O
Edward B-PERSON
seemed O
inclined O
to O
converse O
on O
their O
walk O
home O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
|
      | O
was O
so O
engrossed O
in O
thought O
for O
Mrs. O
Greville B-PERSON
, O
that O
she O
did O
not O
feel O
disposed O
to O
speak O
either O
. O
|
      | O
Herbert B-PERSON
was O
contrasting O
his O
father O
with O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
, O
and O
with O
such O
a O
vivid O
sense O
of O
his O
own O
happier O
|
      | O
lot O
, O
that O
he O
felt O
almost O
oppressed O
with O
the O
thought O
, O
he O
was O
not O
, O
he O
never O
could O
be O
, O
grateful O
|
      | O
enough O
  O
for O
, O
what O
had O
he O
done O
to O
be O
so O
much O
more O
blessed O
? O
And O
when O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
who O
, O
|
      | O
wondering O
at O
their O
long O
absence O
, O
had O
come O
out O
to O
meet O
them O
, O
put O
his O
arm O
affectionately O
round O
|
      | O
him O
, O
and O
asked O
him O
what O
could O
possibly O
make O
him O
look O
so O
pale O
and O
pensive O
, O
the O
boy O
's O
excited O
|
      | O
feelings O
completely O
overpowered O
him O
. O
He O
buried O
his O
face O
on O
his O
father O
's O
shoulder O
, O
and O
burst O
|
      | O
into O
tears O
  O
and O
then O
leaving O
his O
mother O
to O
explain O
it O
, O
for O
he O
felt O
quite O
sure O
she O
could O
, O
|
      | O
without O

telling O
her O
, O
darted O
away O
and O
never O
stopped O
till O
he O
found O
himself O
in O
the O
sanctuary O
|
      | O
of O
his O
own O
room O
  O
and O
there O
he O
remained O
, O
trying O
to O
calm O
himself O
by O
earnest O
thought O
and O
almost O
|
      | O
unconscious O
prayer O
, O
till O
the O
dinner O
- O
bell O
summoned O
him O
to O
rejoin O
his O
family O
, O
which O
he O
did O
, O
|
      | O
quiet O
and O
gentle O
, O
but O
cheerful O
, O
as O
usual O

Edward B-PERSON
did O
not O
forget O
the O
thoughts O

morning O
, O
but O
the O
struggles O
so O
to O
subdue O
his O
pride O
|
      | O
as O
to O
apologize O
to O
Robert B-PERSON
, O
seemed O
very O
much O
more O
difficult O
when O
he O
was O
no O
longer O
hearing O
his O
|
      | O
aunt O

earnest O
words O
  O

he O

conquer O
himself O

the O
fond O
approving O
look O

      | O

he O
was O
rewarded O
, O
gave O
him O
such O
a O
glowing O
feeling O
of O
pleasure O
, O
as O
almost O

No O

I O

should O

I O

Cecil O

Sometimes O
I O
wish O
I O

I O

, O
with O

      | O
great O
glee O

" O
or O
perhaps O
, O
" O
he O
added O
, O
laughing O
, O
" O
your O

mine O

does O
not O

" O
Are O
these O
Mr. O

almost O
sternly O

" O
Why O
ye O

yes O
— O
why O
do O
you O
look O
at O
me O
so O
, O
Percy B-PERSON
? O
I O
am O
sure O
I O
said O
no O
harm O
  O
I O
only O
repeated O
what O

      | O
I O
have O
heard O
mamma O
say O
continually O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
That O
is O
not O
the O
very O
least O
excuse O
for O
your O
disrespect O
to O
your O
father O
  O
and O
if O
he O
think O
thus O
, O
|
      | O
I O
wonder O
you O
should O
talk O
of O
going O
to O
the O
races O
  O
you O
can O
not O
have O
his O
permission O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Oh O
, O
but O
mamma O
has O
promised O
if O
I O
am O
a O
good O
boy O
till O
then O
and O
she O
can O
manage O
it O
, O
I O
shall O
go O
  O

      | O
for O
she O
can O
not O
see O
any O
harm O
in O
it O
. O
And O
as O
for O
waiting O
for O
papa O
's O
permission O
— O
if O
I O
did O
, O
I O
|
      | O
should O
never O
go O
any O
where O
. O
He O
is O
so O
unkind O
, O
that O
I O
am O
always O
afraid O
of O
speaking O
or O
even O
|
      | O
playing O
, O
when O
he O
is O
in O
the O
room O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
You O
are O
a O
silly O
boy O
, O
Cecil O
, O
" O
replied O
young O
Hamilton B-PERSON
  O
" O
Believe O
me O
, O
you O
do O
not O
know O
your O
best O
|
      | O
friend O
. O
I O
should O
be O
very O
sorry O
to O
feel O
thus O
toward O
my O
father O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Oh O
! O
but O
yours O
and O
mine O
are O
very O
different O
sort O
of O
people O
. O
Your O
papa O
never O
punishes O
you O
, O
or O
|
      | O
refuses O
you O
his O
permission O
, O
when O
you O
wish O
particularly O
to O
do O
any O
thing O
, O
or O
go O
any O
where O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
If O
papa O
thinks O
my O
wishes O
foolish O
, O
or O
liable O
to O
lead O
me O
into O
error O
, O
he O
does O
refuse O
me O
|
      | O
without O
scruple O
, O
Cecil O
. O
And O
though O
I O
am O
old O
enough O
now O
, O
I O
hope O
, O
so O
to O
conduct O
myself O
as O
to O
|
      | O
avoid O
actual O
punishment O
: O
when O
I O
was O
as O
young O
as O
you O
are O
, O
papa O
very O
frequently O
punished O
me O
, O
|
      | O
both O
for O
my O
violence O
and O
pride O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
But O
then O
he O
was O
kind O
to O
you O
afterward O
. O
Now O
I O
should O
not O
so O
much O
mind O
papa O
's O
severity O
when O
I O
|
      | O
am O
naughty O
, O
if O
he O
would O
only O
be O
kind O
, O
or O
take O
some O
notice O
of O
me O
when O
I O
am O
good O
. O
But O
has O
Mr. O
|
      | O
Hamilton B-PERSON
told O
you O
not O
to O
go O
to O
the O
races O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Not O
exactly O
: O
he O
has O
merely O
said O
he O
thinks O
it O
a O
day O
most O
unprofitably O
wasted O
  O
and O
that O
the O
|
      | O
gambling O
and O
excesses O
, O
always O
the O
attendant O
of O
races O
, O
are O
not O
fit O
scenes O
for O
young O
persons O
. O
|
      | O
Were O
I O
to O
take O
my O
horse O
and O
go O
, O
he O
would O
not O
, O
perhaps O
, O
be O
actually O
displeased O
, O
as O
I O
am O
old O
|
      | O
enough O
now O
, O
he O
says O
, O
in O
some O
things O
, O
to O
judge O
for O
myself O
  O
but O
I O
should O
be O
acting O
against O
his O
|
      | O
principles O
, O
which O
, O
just O
now O
, O
I O
am O
not O
inclined O
to O
do O
, O
for O
I O
am O
sure O
to O
suffer O
from O
it O
|
      | O
afterward O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Well O
, O
all O
I O
can O
say O
, O
is O
, O
that O
when O
I O
am O
as O
old O
as O
you O
are O
, O
Percy B-PERSON
, O
I O
shall O
certainly O
|
      | O
consider O
myself O
under O
no O
one O
. O
I O
hope O
I O
shall O
be O
at O
Eton B-ORG
by O
that O
time O
, O
and O
then O
we O
shall O
see O
if O
|
      | O
Cecil O
Grahame O
has O
not O
some O
spirit O
in O
him O
. O
I O
would O
not O
be O
tied O
down O
to O
Oakwood B-ORG
, O
and O
to O
Mr. O

      | O
Howard B-PERSON
's O
humdrum O
lessons O
, O
as O
you O
are O
, O
Percy B-PERSON
, O
for O
worlds O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Take O
care O
that O
Cecil B-PERSON
Grahame I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
spirit O
does O
not O
effervesce O
so O
much O
, O
as O
to O
make O
him O
, O
when O
at O
|
      | O
Eton B-PERSON
, O
wish O
himself O
back O
at O
Moorlands B-GPE
, O
" O
replied O
Percy B-PERSON
, O
laughing O
heartily O
at O
his O
young O
|
      | O
companion O
's O
grotesque O
attempts O
at O
self O
- O
consequence O
, O
by O
placing O
his O
cap O
dandily O
on O
his O
head O
, O

      | O
flourishing O
his O
cane O
, O
and O
trying O
to O
make O
himself O
look O
taller O
. O
Cecil O
took O
his O
laugh O
, O
however O
, O
|
      | O
in O
good O
part O
, O
and O
they O
continued O
in O
amicable O
conversation O
till O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
summoned O
Percy B-PERSON
to O
|
      | O
attend O
her O
home O
. O
| 
  | O
Our O
readers O
have O
, O
perhaps O
, O
discovered O
that O
Percy B-PERSON
, O
this B-DATE
day I-DATE
was O
not O
quite O
as O
lively O
as O
usual O
. O
|
      | O
If O
they O
have O
not O
his O
mother O
did O
  O
for O
, O
strange O
to O
say O
, O
he O
walked O
by O
her O
side O
silent O
and O
|
      | O
dispirited O
. O
His O
thoughtlessness O
very O
often O
led O
him O
into O
error O
and O
its O
disagreeable O
|
      | O
consequences O
  O
and O
, O
fearing O
this O
had O
again O
been O
the O
case O
, O
she O
playfully O
inquired O
the O
cause O
of O
|
      | O
his O
most O
unusual O
abstraction O
. O
He O
colored O
, O
but O
evaded O
the O
question O
, O
and O
successfully O
roused O
|
      | O
himself O
to O
talk O
. O
His O
mother O
was O
not O
anxious O
, O
for O
she O
had O
such O
perfect O
confidence O
in O
him O
, O
that O
|
      | O
she O
know O
if O
he O
had O
committed O
error O
, O
he O
would O
redeem O
it O
, O
and O
that O
his O
own O
good O
feelings O
and O
|
      | O
high O
principles O
would O
prevent O
its O
recurrence O
. O
| 
  | O
It O
so O
happened O
, O
however O
, O
that O
young O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
by O
a O
series O
of O
rather O
imprudent O
actions O
, O
had O
|
      | O
plunged O
himself O
into O
such O
a O
very O
unusual O
and O
disagreeable O
position O
, O
as O
not O
very O
well O
to O
know O
|
      | O
how O
to O
extricate O
himself O
from O
it O
, O
without O
a O
full O
confession O
to O
his O
father O
  O
which O
, O
daringly O
|
      | O
brave O
as O
in O
general O
he O
was O
, O
he O
felt O
almost O
as O
if O
he O
really O
had O
not O
the O
courage O
to O
make O
. O
One B-CARDINAL
of O
|
      | O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
's O
most O
imperative O
commands O
was O
, O
that O
his O
sons O
should O
never O
incur O
a O
debt O
, O
and O
, O
to O
|
      | O
prevent O
the O
temptation O
, O
their O
monthly B-DATE
allowance O
was O
an O
ample O
one O
, O
and O
fully O
permitted O
any O
|
      | O
recreative O
indulgences O
they O
might O
desire O
. O
| 
  | O
Now O
Percy B-PERSON
was O
rather O
inclined O
to O
extravagance O
, O
from O
thoughtlessness O
and O
a O
profuse O
|
      | O
generosity O
, O
which O
had O
often O
caused O
him O
such O
annoyance O
as O
to O
make O
him O
resolve O
again O
and O
again O
|
      | O
to O
follow O
his O
father O
's O

keep O
some O
accounts O
of O
his O
expenditure O

as O
a O
slight O
check O
on O

      | O
himself O
. O
The O
admiration O
for O
beauty O
in O
the O
fine O
arts O
, O
which O
his O
mother O
had O
so O
sedulously O
|
      | O
cultivated O
, O
had O
had O
only B-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
bad O
effect O
  O
and O
that O
was O
that O
his O
passion O
for O
prints O

      | O
paintings O
, O
and O
illustrated O
and O
richly O
- O
bound O
volumes O
, O
sometimes O
carried O
him O
beyond O
bounds O
, O
and O
|
      | O
very O
often O
occasioned O
regret O
, O
that O
he O
had O
not O
examined O
the O
letter O

press O
of O
such O
works O
, O
as O
well O
|
      | O
as O
their O
engravings O
and O
bindings O
. O
He O
had O
given O
orders O
to O
Mr. O
Harris B-PERSON
, O
a O
large O
fancy O
stationer O
, O
|
      | O
librarian O
, O
and O
publisher O
of O
T O
— O
, O
to O
procure O
for O
him O
a O
set O
of O
engravings O
, O
whose O
very O
interesting O
|
      | O
subjects O
and O
beautiful O
workmanship O
, O
Mr. O
Grahame B-PERSON
had O
so O
vividly O
described O
to O
him O
, O
that O
young O
|
      | O
Hamilton B-PERSON
felt O
to O
do O
without O
them O
till O
his O
father O
or O
he O
himself O
should O
visit O
the O
metropolis O
, O
|
      | O
and O
so O
judge O
of O
their O
worth O
themselves O
, O
was O
quite O
impossible O
. O
The O
order O
was O
given O
without O
the O
|
      | O
least O
regard O
to O
price O
. O
They O
arrived O
at O
the B-DATE
end I-DATE
of I-DATE
the I-DATE
month I-DATE
, O
and O
the O
young O
gentleman O
, O
to O
his O
|
      | O
extreme O
astonishment O
, O
discovered O
that O
his O
month B-DATE
's O
allowance O
had O
been O
so O
expended O
, O
as O
not O
to O
|
      | O
leave O
him O
a O
half O
- O
quarter O
of O
the O
necessary O
sum O
. O
What O
to O
do O
he O
did O
not O
very O
well O
know O
. O
Mr. O
|
      | O
Harris B-PERSON
had O
had O
great O
difficulty O
in O
procuring O
the O
prints O
, O
and O
of O
course O
he O
was O
bound O
in O
honor O
|
      | O
to O
take O
them O
. O
If O
he O
waited O
till O
he O
could O
pay O
for O
them O
, O
he O
must O
sacrifice O
the O
whole O
of O
one B-CARDINAL
|
      | O
month B-DATE
's O
allowance O
, O
and O
then O
how O
could O
he O
keep O
free O
from O
debt O
till O
the O
next O
? O
As O
for O
applying O
to O
|
      | O
his O
father O
, O
he O
shrank O
from O
it O
with O
actual O
pain O
. O
How O
could O
he O
ask O
his O
ever O
kind O
and O
indulgent O
|
      | O
parent O
to O
discharge O
a O
debt O
incurred O
by O
such O
a O
thoughtless O
act O
of O
unnecessary O
extravagance O
? O
Mr. O
|
      | O
Harris B-PERSON
made O
very O
light O
of O
it O
, O
declaring O
that O
, O
if O
Mr. O
Percy B-PERSON
did O
not O
pay O
him O
for O
a O
twelvemonth O
, O
|
      | O
it O
was O
of O
no O
consequence O
  O
he O
would O
trust O
him O
for O
any O
sum O
or O
any O
time O
he O
liked O
. O
But O
to O
make O
no O
|
      | O
attempt O
to O
liquidate O
his O
debt O
was O
as O
impossible O
as O
to O
speak O
to O
his O
father O
. O
No O
, O
after O
a O
violent O
|
      | O
struggle O
with O
his O
pride O
, O
which O
did O
not O
at O
all O
like O
the O
idea O
of O
betraying O
his O
inability O
to O
pay O
|
      | O
the O
whole O
, O
or O
of O
asking O
a O
favor O
of O
Mr. O
Harris B-PERSON
, O
he O
agreed O
to O
pay O
his O
debt O
by O
installments O
, O
and O
|
      | O
so O
in O
two B-DATE
or I-DATE
three I-DATE
months I-DATE
, O
at O
the O
very O
latest O
, O
discharge O
the O
whole O
. O
| 
  | O
One B-DATE
week I-DATE
afterward O
he O
received O
his O
month B-DATE
's O
allowance O
, O
and O
riding O
over O
directly O
to O
the O
town O
|
      | O
relieved O
his O
conscience O
of O
half B-CARDINAL
its O
load O
. O
To O
have O
only B-CARDINAL
half I-CARDINAL
his O
usual O
sum O
, O
however O
, O
for O
|
      | O
monthly B-DATE
expenditure O
caused O
him O
so O
many O
checks O
and O
annoyances O
as O
to O
make O
him O
hate O
the O
very O
|
      | O
sight O
of O
the O
prints O
whose O
possession O
he O
had O
so O
coveted O
, O
but O
he O
looked O
forward O
to O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
|
      | I-DATE
month I-DATE
to O
be O
free O
at O
least O
of O
Mr. O
Harris B-PERSON
. O
The O
idea O
of O
disobedience O
to O
his O
father O
in O
incurring O
a O
|
      | O
debt O
at O
all O
, O
causing O
him O
more O
annoyance O
than O
all O
the O
rest O
. O
| 
  | O
Again O
the B-DATE
first I-DATE
day I-DATE
of I-DATE
the I-DATE
month I-DATE
came O
round O
, O
and O
putting O
the O
full O
sum O
required O
in O
his O
purse O
, O
|
      | O
he O
set O
off O
, O
but O
on O
his O
way O
encountered O
such O
a O
scene O
of O
distress O
, O
that O
every O
thought O
fled O
from O
|
      | O
his O
mind O
, O
except O
how O
to O
relieve O
it O
. O
He O
accompanied O
the O
miserable O
half B-CARDINAL
- O
famished O
man O
to O
a O
hut O
in O
|
      | O
which O
lay O
a O
seemingly O
dying O
woman O
with O
a O
new O
- O
born O
babe O
, O
and O
two B-CARDINAL
or I-CARDINAL
three I-CARDINAL
small O
half B-CARDINAL
- O
starved O
, O
|
      | O
half B-CARDINAL
- O
naked O
children O
— O
listened O
to O
their O
story O
, O
which O
was O
really O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
truth O
and O
misfortune O
, O
not O
|
      | O
of O
whining O
deceit O
, O
poured O
the O
whole O
contents O
of O
his O
purse O
into O
their O
laps O
, O
and O
rode O
off O
to O
T O
— O
, O
|
      | O
to O
find O
not O
Mr. O
Harris B-PERSON
but O
Mr. O
Maitland B-PERSON
, O
and O
implore O
him O
to O
see O
what O
his O
skill O
would O
do O
for O
|
      | O
the O
poor O
woman O
. O
He O
encountered O
that O
gentleman O
at O
the O
outskirts O
of O
the O
town O
, O
told O
his O
story O
, O
|
      | O
and O
was O
so O
delighted O
at O
Mr. O
Maitland B-PERSON
's O
willing O
promise O
to O
go O
directly O
, O
and O
also O
to O
report O
the O
|
      | O
case O
to O
those O
who O
would O
relieve O
it O
, O
that O
he O
never O
thought O
of O
any O
thing O
else O
till O
he O
found O
|
      | O
himself O
directly O
opposite O
Mr. O
Harris B-PERSON
's O
shop O
, O
and O
his O
bounding O
heart O
sunk O
suddenly O
down O
, O
as O
|
      | O
impelled O
by O
a O
weight O
of O
lead O
. O
The O
conviction O
flashed O
upon O
him O
that O
he O
had O
been O
giving O
away O
|
      | O
money O
which O
was O
actually O
not O
his O
own O
  O
and O
the O
deed O
which O
had O
been O
productive O
of O
so O
much O
|
      | O
internal O
happiness O
, O
now O
seemed O
to O
reproach O
and O
condemn O
him O
. O
He O
rode O
back O
without O
even O
seeking O
|
      | O
Mr. O
Harris B-PERSON
, O
for O
what O
could O
he O
tell O
him O
as O
the O
reason O
of O
his O
non O
- O
payment O
? O
Certainly O
not O
his O
|
      | O
having O
given O
it O
away O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
first B-ORDINAL
of O
May B-DATE
, O
which O
was O
his O
birthday O
, O
he O
had O
been O
long O
engaged O
to O
spend O
with O
some O
young O
|
      | O
men O
and O
lads O
who O
were O
to O
have O
a O
grand O
game O
of O
cricket O
, O
a O
jovial O
dinner O
, O
an O
adjournment O
to O
some O
|
      | O
evening B-TIME
amusement O
, O
and O
, O
to O
conclude O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
a O
gay O
supper O
, O
with O
glees O
and O
songs O
. O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
|
      | O
had O
rather O
wished O
Percy B-PERSON
to O
leave O
the O
party O
after O
dinner O
, O
and O
had O
told O
him O
so O
, O
merely O
, O
however O
, O
|
      | O
as O
a O
preference O
, O
not O
a O
command O
, O
but O
giving O
him O
permission O
to O
use O
his O
own O
discretion O
. O
Percy O
|
      | O
knew O
there O
would O
be O
several O
expenses O
attendant O
on O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
but O
still O
he O
had O
promised O
so O
long O
|
      | O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
party O
, O
which O
all O
had O
declared O
would O
be O
nothing O
without O
him O
, O
and O
his O
own O
|
      | O
inclinations O
so O
urged O
him O
to O
join O
it O
, O
that O
it O
seemed O
to O
him O
utterly O
impossible O
to O
draw O
back O
, O
|
      | O
especially O
as O
he O
could O
give O
no O
excuse O
for O
doing O
so O
. O
How O
could O
he O
say O
that O
he O
could O
not O
afford O
|
      | O
it O
? O
when O
he O
was O
, O
or O
ought O
to O
have O
been O
, O
nearly O
the O
richest O
of O
the O
party O
  O
and O
what O
would O
his O
|
      | O
father O
think O
? O
| 
  | O
He O
went O
. O
The O
day O
was O
thoroughly O
delightful O
, O
and O
so O
exciting O
, O
that O
though O
he O
had O
started O
from O
|
      | O
home O
with O
the O
intention O
of O
leaving O
them O
after O
dinner O
, O
he O
could O
not O
resist O
the O
pleadings O
of O
his O
|
      | O
companions O
and O
his O
own O
wishes O
, O
and O
remained O
. O
At O
supper O
alone O
excitement O
and O
revelry O
seemed O
to O
|
      | O
have O
gained O
the O
upper O
hand O
, O
and O
Percy B-PERSON
, O
though O
steady O
in O
entirely O
abstaining O
from O
all O
excess O
, O
|
      | O
was O
not O
quite O
so O
guarded O
as O
usual O
. O
A O
clergyman O
had O
lately O
appeared O
at O
T O
— O
, O
whose O
appearance O
, O
|
      | O
manners O
, O
and O
opinions O
had O
given O
more O
than O
usual O
food O
for O
gossip O
, O
and O
much O
uncharitableness O
. O
|
      | O
His O
cloth O
indeed O
ought O
to O
have O
protected O
him O
, O
but O
it O
rather O
increased O
the O
satire O
, O
sarcasm O
, O
and O
|
      | O
laughter O
which O
he O
excited O
. O
He O
was O
brought O
forward O
by O
the O
thoughtless O
youths O
of O
Percy B-PERSON
's O
party O
, O
|
      | O
quizzed O
unmercifully O
, O
made O
the O
object O
of O
some O
clever O
caricatures O
and O
satires O
, O
and O
though O
young O
|
      | O
Hamilton B-PERSON
at O
first B-ORDINAL
kept O
aloof O
, O
he O
could O
not O
resist O
the O
contagion O
. O
He O
dashed O
off O
about O
|
      | O
half B-CARDINAL
- O
a O
- O
dozen O
verses O
of O
such O
remarkably O
witty O
and O
clever O
point O
, O
that O
they O
were O
received O
with O
|
      | O
roars O
of O
applause O
, O
and O
an O
unanimous O
request O
for O
distribution O
  O
but O
this O
he O
positively O
refused O
, O
|
      | O
and O
put O
them O
up O
with O
one B-CARDINAL
or O
two B-CARDINAL
other O
poems O
of O
more O
innocent O
wit O
, O
in O
which O
he O
was O
fond O
of O
|
      | O
indulging O
, O
into O
his O
pocket O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
day O
closed O
, O
and O
the O
next B-TIME
morning I-TIME
brought O
with O
it O
so O
many O
regrets O
, O
and O
such O
a O
confused O
|
      | O
recollection O
of O
the O
very O
unusual O
excitement O
of O
the B-TIME
previous I-TIME
evening I-TIME
, O
that O
he O
was O
glad O
to O
|
      | O
dismiss O
the O
subject O
from O
his O
mind O
, O
and O
threw O
his O
satire O
, O
as O
he O
believed O
, O
into O
the O
fire O
. O
In O
|
      | O
fact O
, O
he O
was O
so O
absorbed O
with O
the O
disagreeable O
conviction O
that O
he O
could O
only O
pay O
Mr. O
Harris B-PERSON
a O
|
      | O
third B-ORDINAL
of O
his O
remaining O
debt O
, O
trifling O
as O
in O
reality O
it O
was O
, O
that O
he O
thought O
of O
nothing O
else O
. O
|
      | O
Now O
Mr. O
Harris B-PERSON
was O
the O
editor O

publisher O
of O
rather O
a O
clever O
weekly B-DATE
paper O
, O
and O
Percy B-PERSON

      | O
happened O
to O
be O
in O
his O
parlor O
waiting O
to O
speak O
to O
him O
, O
while O
he O
was O
paying O
a O
contribution O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
wish O
my O
head O
were O
clever O
enough O
to O
get O
out O
of O
your O
debt O
in O
that O
comfortable O
way O
, O
" O
he O
|
      | O
said O
, O
half B-CARDINAL
laughing O
, O
as O
the O
gentleman O
left O
them O
together O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
wish O
all O
my O
customers O
were O
as O
desirous O
of O
paying O
their O
large O
debts O
as O
you O
are O
your O
small O

      | O
ones O
, O
" O
was O
Mr. O
Harris B-PERSON
's O
reply O
. O
" O
But O
I O
have O
heard O
something O
of O
your O
clever O
verses O
, O
Mr. O
Percy B-PERSON
  O
|
      | O
if O
you O
will O
let O
me O
see O
some O
, O
I O
really O
may O
be O
able O
to O
oblige O
you O
, O
as O
you O
seem O
so O
very O
anxious O
|
      | O
to O
have O
nothing O
more O
to O
do O
with O
me O
— O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
In O
the O
way O
of O
debt O
, O
not O
of O
purchases O
, O
Mr. O
Harris B-PERSON
  O
and O
I O
assure O
you O
, O
I O
am O
not O
thinking O
so O
|
      | O
much O
about O
you O
, O
as O
of O
my O
own O
disobedience O
. O
I O
will O
lend O
you O
my O
papers O
, O
only O
you O
must O
give O
me O
|
      | O
your O
word O
not O
to O
publish O
them O
with O
my O
name O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
They O
will O
not O
be O
worth O
so O
much O
, O
" O
replied O
Mr. O
Harris B-PERSON
, O
smiling O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Only O
let O
me O
feel O
they O
have O
helped O
to O
discharge O
my O
debt O
, O
or O
at O
least O
let O
me O
know O
how O
much O
|
      | O
more O
is O
wanted O
to O
do O
so O
, O
and O
I O
will O
worship O
the O
muses O
henceforth O
, O
" O
replied O
Percy B-PERSON
, O
with O
almost O
|
      | O
his O
natural O
gayety O
, O
for O
he O
felt O
he O
wrote O
better O
verses O
than O
those O
Mr. O
Harris B-PERSON
had O
been O
so O
|
      | O
liberally O
paying O
for O
  O
and O
the O
idea O
of O
feeling O
free O
again O
was O
so O
very O
delightful O
, O
that O
, O
after O
|
      | O
receiving O
Mr. O
Harris B-PERSON
's O
solemn O
promise O
not O
to O
betray O
his O
authorship O
, O
he O
galloped O
home O
, O
more O
|
      | O
happy O
than O
he O
had O
been O
for O
some B-DATE
days I-DATE
. O
| 
  | O
Mr. O
Harris B-PERSON
had O
said O
he O
must O
have O
them O
that B-TIME
evening I-TIME
, O
and O
Robert B-PERSON
was O
leaving O
for O
the O
town O
, O
as O
|
      | O
his O
young O
master O
entered O
the O
house O
. O
He O
hastily O
put O
up O
his O
portfolio O
, O
and O
sent O
it O
off O
. O
His O
|
      | O
conscience O
was O
so O
perfectly O
free O
from O
keeping O
any O
thing O
that O
he O
afterward O
had O
cause O
to O
regret O
, O
|
      | O
that O
he O
did O
not O
think O
of O
looking O
them O
over O
, O
and O
great O
was O
his O
delight O
, O
when O
a O
few O
lines O
|
      | O
arrived O
from O
Mr. O
Harris B-PERSON
, O
speaking O
in O
the O
highest O
terms O
of O
his O
talent O
, O
and O
saying O
, O
that O
the O
set O
|
      | O
of O
verses O
he O
had O
selected O
, O
even O
without O
the O
attraction O
of O
his O
name O
, O
would O
entirely O
liquidate O
|
      | O
his O
trifling O
debt O
. O
| 
  | O
For O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
few I-DATE
days I-DATE
Percy B-PERSON
trod O
on O
air O
. O
He O
had O
resolved O
on O
waiting O
till O
the O
poem O
appeared O
, O
|
      | O
and O
then O
, O
as O
he O
really O
had O
discharged O
his O
debt O
, O
take O
courage O
and O
confess O
the O
whole O
to O
his O
|
      | O
father O
, O
for O
his O
idea O
of O
truth O
made O
him O
shrink O
from O
any O
farther O
concealment O
. O
He O
hoped O
and O
|
      | O
believed O
that O
his O
father O
would O
regard O
the O
pain O
and O
constant O
annoyance O
he O
had O
been O
enduring O
so O
|
      | O
long O
, O
as O
sufficient O
penalty O
for O
his O
disobedience O
, O
and O
after O
a O
time O
give O
him O
back O
the O
|
      | O
confidence O
, O
which O
he O
feared O
must O
at O
his O
first B-ORDINAL
confession O
be O
withdrawn O
. O
| 
  | O
What O
, O
then O
, O
was O
his O
grief O
, O
his O
vexation O
, O
almost O
his O
despair O
, O
when O
he O
recognized O
in O
the O
poem O
|
      | O
selected O
, O
the O
verses O
he O
thought O
and O
believed O
he O
had O
burned O
the O
morning O
after O
they O
were O
|
      | O
written O
  O
and O
which O
in O
print O
, O
and O
read O
by O
his O
sober O
self O
, O
seemed O
such O
a O
heartless O
, O
glaring O
, O
|
      | O
cruel O
insult O
, O
not O
only O
on O
a O
fellow O
- O
creature O
, O
but O
a O
minister O
of O
God O
, O
that O
he O
felt O
almost O
|
      | O
overwhelmed O
. O
What O
could O
he O
do O
? O
Mr. O
Harris B-PERSON
was O
not O
to O
blame O
, O
for O
he O
had O
made O
no O
reservation O
as O
|
      | O
to O
the O
contents O
of O
his O
portfolio O
. O
His O
name O
, O
indeed O
, O
was O
not O
to O
them O
, O
and O
only O
having O
been O
read O
|
      | O
lightly O
once O
to O
his O
companions O
of O
that O
hateful O
supper O
— O
for O
so O
he O
now O
felt O
it O
— O
almost O
all O
of O
whom O
|
      | O
were O
not O
perfectly O
sober O
, O
there O
was O
a O
chance O
of O
their O
never O
being O
recognized O
as O
his O
, O
and O
as O
|
      | O
their O
subject O
did O
not O
live O
near O
any O
town O
where O
the O
paper O
was O
likely O
to O
circulate O
, O
might O
never O
|
      | O
meet O
his O
eye O
. O
But O
all O
this O
was O
poor O
comfort O
. O
The O
paper O
was O
very O
seldom O
seen O
at O
Oakwood B-ORG
, O
but O
|
      | O
its O
contents O
were O
often O
spoken O
of O
before O
his O
parents O
, O
and O
how O
could O
he O
endure O
a O
reference O
to O
|
      | O
those O
verses O
, O
how O
bear O
this O
accumulation O
of O
concealment O
, O
and O
, O
as O
he O
felt O
, O
deceit O
, O
and O
all O
|
      | O
sprung O
from O
the O
one B-CARDINAL
thoughtless O
act O
of O
ordering O
an O
expensive O
and O
unnecessary O
indulgence O
, O
|
      | O
without O
sufficient O
consideration O
how O
it O
was O
to O
be O
paid O
. O
To O
tell O
his O
father O
, O
avow O
himself O
the O
|
      | O
author O
of O
such O
a O
satire O
, O
and O
on O
such O
a O
subject O
, O
he O
could O
not O
. O
Could O
he O
tell O
his O
mother O
, O
and O
|
      | O
implore O
her O
intercession O
? O
that O
seemed O
like O
a O
want O
of O
confidence O
in O
his O
father O
— O
no O
— O
if O
he O
ever O
|
      | O
could O
gain O
courage O
to O
confess O
it O
, O
it O
should O
be O
to O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
alone O
  O
but O
the O
more O
he O
thought O
, O
|
      | O
the O
more O
, O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
, O
his O
courage O
failed O
. O
It O
was O
only O
the O
day O
before O
his O
visit O
to O
Lady O
|
      | O
Helen O
's O
that O
he O
had O
discovered O
this O
accumulation O
of O
misfortune O
, O
and O
therefore O
it O
was O
not O
much O
|
      | O
wonder O
he O
was O
so O
dispirited O
. O
Two B-DATE
days I-DATE
afterward O
Herbert B-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
blushing O
cheek O
and O
very O
timid O
|
      | O
voice O
, O
asked O
his O
father O
to O
grant O
him O
a O
great O
favor O
. O
He O
was O
almost O
afraid O
to O
ask O
it O
, O
he O
said O
, O
|
      | O
but O
he O
hoped O
and O
believed O
his O
parent O
would O
trust O
his O
assurance O
that O
it O
was O
for O
nothing O
|
      | O
improper O
. O
It O
was O
that O
he O
might O
be O
from O
home O
next B-DATE
day I-DATE
unattended O
for O
several B-TIME
hours I-TIME
. O
He O
should O
|
      | O
go O
on O
horseback O
, O
but O
he O
was O
so O
accustomed O
to O
ride O
, O
and O
his O
horse O
was O
so O
steady O
, O
he O
hoped O
he O
|
      | O
might O
be O
allowed O
to O
go O
alone O
. O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
looked O
very O
much O
surprised O
, O
as O
did O
all O
present O
. O
|
      | O
That O
the O
quiet O
, O
studious O
Herbert B-PERSON
should O
wish O
to O
give O
up O
his O
favorite O
pursuits O
, O
so O
soon O
too O
|
      | O
after O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
's O
return O
, O
and O
go O
on O
what O
appeared O
such O
a O
mysterious O
excursion O
, O
was O
something O
|
      | O
so O
extraordinary O
, O
that O
various O
expressions O
of O
surprise O
broke O
from O
his O
sisters O
and O
Edward B-PERSON
. O
|
      | O
Percy B-PERSON
did O
look O
up O
but O
made O
no O
observation O
. O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
only O
paused O
, O
however O
, O
to O
consult O
his O
|
      | O
wife O
's O
face O
and O
then O
replied O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
You O
certainly O
have O
mystified O
us O
, O
my O
dear O
boy O
  O
but O
I O
freely O
grant O
you O
my O
consent O
, O
and O
if O
I O
|
      | O
can O
read O
your O
mother O
's O
face O
aright O
, O
hers O
is O
not O
far O
distant O
. O
You O
are O
now O
nearly O
fifteen O
, O
and O
|
      | O
never O
once O
from O
your O
birth O
has O
your O
conduct O
given O
me O
an O
hour B-TIME
's O
pain O
or O
uneasiness O
  O
I O
have O
|
      | O
therefore O
quite O
sufficient O
confidence O
in O
your O
integrity O
and O
steadiness O
to O
trust O
you O
, O
as O
you O
|
      | O
wish O
, O
alone O
. O
I O
will O
not O
even O
ask O
your O
intentions O
, O
for O
I O
am O
sure O
they O
will O
not O
lead O
you O
into O

      | O
wrong O

" O
| 
  | O
" O
Thank O
you O
, O
again O
and O
again O
, O
my O
own O
dear O
father O

I O
hope O
I O

never O
do O
any O
thing O
to O

      | O
forfeit O
your O
confidence O

" O
replied O
Herbert B-PERSON
, O
so O
eagerly O
that O
his O
cheeks O
flushed O
still O
deeper O
, O
|
      | O
and O
his O
eyes O
glistened O
  O
then O
throwing O
himself O
on O
the O
stool O
at O
his O
mother O
's O
feet O
, O
he O
said O
, O

      | O
pleadingly O
, O
" O
Will O
you O
, O
too O
, O
trust O
me O
, O
dearest O
mother O

me O
not O

I O

      | O
do O
not O
appear O
till O
after O
our O
dinner O

hour?—promise O
me O
this O

I O
shall O

no O

      | O
expedition O

" O
| 
  | O
" O
Most O
faithfully O
, O
" O
replied O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
fondly O
. O
" O
I O
trust O
my O
Herbert B-PERSON
almost O
as O
I O
would O
his O

      | O
father O
  O
I O
do O
not O
say O
as O
much O
for O
this O
young O
man O
, O
nor O
for O
that O

" O
she O
added O
, O
playfully O
laying O
|
      | O
her O
hand O
on O
Percy B-PERSON
's O
shoulder O
, O
and O
laughing O
at O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
so O
excessively O
amused O
at O
the O
|
      | O
sage O
Herbert B-PERSON
's O
turning O
truant O
, O
that O
he O
was O
giving O
vent O
to O
a O
variety O
of O
most O
grotesque O
antics O
|
      | O
of O
surprise O
. O
Percy B-PERSON
sighed O
so O
heavily O
that O
his O
mother O
was O
startled O
. O

" O
I O
did O
not O
intend O
to O
call O
such O
a O
very O
heavy O
sigh O

my O
boy O
, O
" O
she O
said O
. O
" O
In O
an O
emergency O
I O

      | O
would O
trust O
you O
quite O

Herbert B-PERSON

you O
have O
often O
yourself O

" O

" O
Indeed O
I O
do O

mother O
  O
I O
wish O
I O
were O
more O

him O

" O
exclaimed O
Percy B-PERSON
, O
far O
more O
|
      | O
despondingly O
than O
usual O
. O

  | O
" O
You O
will O
be O
steady O
all O
in O
time O
, O
my O
boy O

I O
have O
not O
the O
very O
slightest O
fear O

as O
I O
like O

      | O
variety O
, O
even O
in O
my O
sons O

I O
would O
rather O
retain O
my O
Percy B-PERSON
, O
with O
all O
his O
boyish O
errors O
, O
than O

      | O

even O
another O

So O
pray O
do O
not O
look O
so O
sad O
, O
or O
I O
shall O
fancy O
I O
have O
given O
you O
pain O
, O

      | O
when O
I O
only O
spoke O
in O
jest O

" O
| 
  | O
Percy B-PERSON
threw O
his O
arm O
round O
her O
waist O
, O
and O
kissed O
her O
two B-CARDINAL
or I-CARDINAL
three I-CARDINAL
times O
, O
without O
saying O
a O
|
      | O
word O
, O
and O
when O
he O
started O
up O
and O
, O
said O
, O
in O
his O
usual O
gay O
tone O
, O
that O
as O
he O
was O
not O
going O
to O

      | O
turn O
truant O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
day I-DATE

he O
must O
go O
and O
finish O
some O
work O

she O
saw O
tears O
in O
his O
eyes O
. O
That O
|
      | O
something O
was O
wrong O
, O
she O
felt O
certain O
, O
but O
still O
she O
trusted O
in O
his O
candor O
and O
integrity O
, O
and O

      | O
did O
not O
express O
her O
fears O
even O
to O
her O
husband O
. O

  | O
The O
morrow O
came O
. O
Percy B-PERSON
and O
Edward B-PERSON
went O
to O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON

, O
and O
Herbert B-PERSON
at O
half B-DATE
- I-DATE
past I-DATE
nine I-DATE
|
      | O
mounted O
his O
quiet O
horse O
, O
and O
after O
affectionately O
embracing O
his O
mother O
, O
and O
again O
promising O
|
      | O
care O
and O
steadiness O
, O
departed O
. O
He O
had O
risen O
at O
five B-TIME
this I-TIME
morning I-TIME
, O
and O
studied O
till O
breakfast O
|
      | O
so O
earnestly O
that O
a O
double O
portion O
was O
prepared O
for O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
day I-DATE
. O
He O
had O
said O
, O
as O
he O
was O
|
      | O
starting O
, O
that O
, O
if O
he O
might O
remain O
out O
so O
long O
, O
he O
should O
like O
to O
call O
at O
Greville B-GPE
Manor I-GPE
on O

      | O
his O
way O
back O
, O
take O
tea O
there O
, O
and O
return O
home O
in O
the O
cool O
of O
the O
evening O
. O

  | O
" O
Your O
next O
request O
, O
my O
very O
modest O
son O

will O
be O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
to O
stay O
out O
all B-TIME
night I-TIME

" O
replied O

      | O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
  O
" O
and O
that O
certainly O
will O
be O
refused O

This O
is O
the O
last O

I O

consent O

off O
with O
you O

my O
boy O

enjoy O
yourself O

" O

  | O
But B-PERSON
Herbert I-PERSON
did O
not O
expect O
to O
enjoy O
himself O
half B-CARDINAL
as O
much O
as O
if O
he O
had O
gone O
to O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
's O
|
      | O
as O
usual O
. O
He O
did O
not O
like O
to O
mention O
his O
real O
object O
, O
for O
it O
appeared O
as O
if O
the O
chances O
were O
|
      | O
so O
much O
against O
its O
attainment O
, O
and O
if O
it O
were O
fulfilled O
, O
to O
speak O
about O
it O
would O
be O
equally O
|
      | O
painful O
, O
from O
its O
having O
been O
an O
act O
of O
kindness O
. O
| 
  | O
The B-DATE
day I-DATE
passed O
quietly O
, O
and O
a B-TIME
full I-TIME
hour I-TIME
before O
prayers O
, O
Herbert B-PERSON
was O
seen O
riding O
through O
the O

      | O
grounds O
, O
and O
when O
he O
entered O
the O
usual O
sitting O
- O
room O
, O
he O
looked O
so O
happy O
, O
so O
animated O
that O
, O
if O
|
      | O
his O
parents O
had O
felt O
any O
anxiety O
— O
which O
they O
had O
not O
— O
it O
would O
have O
vanished O
at O
once O

But O
though O

      | O
they O
were O
contented O
not O
to O
ask O
him O
any O
questions O
, O
the O
young O
party O
were O
not O

and O
, O
except O
by O

      | O
Percy B-PERSON
( O
who O
seemed O
intently O
engaged O
with O
a O
drawing O
) O
, O
he O
was O
attacked O
on O
all O
sides O
, O

, O
to O
add O

      | O
to O
their O
mirth O
, O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
took O
the O
part O
of O
the O
curious O
, O
his O
wife O
that O
of O
her O
son O

" O
Ah O
, O
mamma O
may O
well O
take O
Herbert B-PERSON

part O

exclaimed O
the O
little O
joyous O
Emmeline O
  O
" O
for O
of O

      | O
course O
she O

" O

was O
the O
reply O
from O
both O
at O
the O

      | O
same O
moment O
, O
but O
the O
denial O
was O
useless O
  O
and O
the O
prayer O

bell O
rung O
, O
before O
any O
satisfaction O
for O

      | O
the O
curious O
could O
be O
obtained O
, O
except O
that O
from O
half B-DATE

past I-DATE
six B-CARDINAL
Herbert B-PERSON
had O
been O
very O
quietly O
at O
|
      | O
Mrs. O
Greville B-PERSON
's O
. O
| 
  | O
That O
night O
, O
as O
Percy B-PERSON
sat O
in O
gloomy O
meditation O
in O
his O
own O
room O
, O
before O
he O
retired O
to O
bed O
, O
he O
|
      | O
felt O
a O
hand O
laid O
gently O
on O
his O
shoulder O
, O
and O
looking O
up O
, O
beheld O
his O
brother O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
Have O
you O
lost O
all O
interest O
in O
me O
, O
Percy B-PERSON
? O
" O
asked O
Herbert B-PERSON
, O
with O
almost O
melancholy O
reproach O
. O
|
      | O
" O
If O
you O
had O
expressed O
one O
word O
of O
inquiry O
as O
to O
my O
proceedings O
, O
I O
should O
have O
told O
you O
all O
|
      | O
without O
the O
slightest O
reserve O
. O
You O
have O
never O
before O
been O
so O
little O
concerned O
for O
me O
, O
and O
|
      | O
indeed O
I O
do O
not O
like O
it O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
could O
not O
ask O
your O
confidence O
, O
my O
dear O
Herbert B-PERSON
, O
when O
for O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
three I-DATE
months I-DATE
I O
have O
|
      | O
been O
wanting O
in O
openness O
to O
you O
. O
Indeed O
, O
annoyed O
as O
I O
am O
with O
my O
own O
folly O
, O
I O
was O
as O
deeply O
|
      | O
interested O
as O
all O
the O
rest O
in O
your O
expedition O
, O
though O
I O
guessed O
its O
object O
could O
be O
nothing O
|
      | O
but O
kindness O
  O
but O
how O
could O
I O
ask O
your O
secret O
when O
I O
was O
so O
reserved O
with O
you O
. O
" O

  | O
" O
Then O
do O
not O
let O
us O
have O
secrets O
from O
each O
other O
any O
longer O
, O
dearest O
Percy B-PERSON
, O
" O
pleaded O
|
      | O
Herbert B-PERSON
, O
twining O
his O
arm O
round O
his O
neck O
, O
and O
looking O
with O
affectionate O
confidence O
in O
his O
face O
. O
|
      | O
" O
I O
do O
not O
at O
all O
see O
why O
my O
secret O
must O
comprise O
more O
worth O
and O
kindness O
than O
yours O
. O
You O
talk O
|
      | O
of O
folly O
, O
and O
I O
have O
fancied O
for O
some B-DATE
days I-DATE
that O
you O
are O
not O
quite O
happy O
  O
but O
you O
often O
blame O
|
      | O
yourself O
so O
much O
more O
than O
you O
deserve O
, O
that O
you O
do O
not O
frighten O
me O
in O
the O
least O
. O
You O
said O
, O
|
      | O
last B-TIME
night I-TIME
, O
you O
wished O
you O
were O
more O
like O
me O
  O
but O
, O
indeed O
, O
if O
you O
were O
, O
I O
should O
be O
very O
|
      | O
sorry O
. O
What O
would O
become O
of O
me O
without O
your O
mirth O
and O
liveliness O
, O
and O
your O
strength O
and O
|
      | O
ever O
- O
working O
care O
to O
protect O
me O
from O
any O
thing O
like O
pain O
, O
either O
mentally O
or O
bodily O
? O
I O
should O
|
      | O
not O
like O
my O
own O
self O
for O
my O
brother O
at O
all O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Nor O
I O
myself O
for O
mine O
, O
" O
replied O
Percy B-PERSON
, O
so O
strangely O
cheered O
, O
that O
he O
almost O
laughed O
at O
|
      | O
Herbert B-PERSON
's O
very O
novel O
idea O
, O
and O
after O
listening O
with O
earnest O
interest O
to O
his O
story O
, O
took O
|
      | O
courage O
and O
told O
his O
own O
. O
Herbert B-PERSON
in O
this O
instance O
, O
however O
, O
could O
not O
comfort O
him O
as O
|
      | O
successfully O
as O
usual O
. O
The O
satire O
was O
the O
terrible O
thing O
  O
every O
thing O
else O
but O
that O
, O
even O
the O
|
      | O
disobedience O
of O
the O
debt O
, O
he O
thought O
might O
be O
easily O
remedied O
by O
an O
open O
confession O
to O
his O
|
      | O
father O
  O
but O
that O
unfortunate O
oversight O
in O
not O
looking O
over O
his O
papers O
before O
he O
sent O
them O
to O
|
      | O
Mr. O
Harris B-PERSON
, O
the O
seeming O
utter O
impossibility O
to O
stop O
their O
circulation O
, O
was O
to O
both O
these O
|
      | O
single O
- O
hearted O
, O
high O
- O
principled O
lads O
something O
almost O
overwhelming O
. O
It O
did O
not O
in O
the O
least O
|
      | O
signify O
to O
either O
that O
Percy B-PERSON
might O
never O
be O
known O
as O
their O
author O
. O
Herbert B-PERSON
could O
not O
tell O
him O
|
      | O
what O
to O
do O
, O
except O
that O
, O
if O
he O
could O
but O
get O
sufficient O
courage O
to O
tell O
their O
father O
, O
even O
if O
|
      | O
he O
could O
not O
help O
them O
, O
he O
was O
sure O
it O
would O
be O
a O
great O
weight O
off O
his O
mind O
, O
and O
then O
he O
|
      | O
gently O
reproached O
him O
for O
not O
coming O
to O
him O
to O
help O
him O
discharge O
his O
debt O
  O
it O
was O
surely O
much O
|
      | O
better O
to O
owe O
a O
trifle O
to O
his O
brother O
than O
to O
Mr. O
Harris B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
" O
And O
, O
to O
gratify O
my O
extravagance O
, O
deprive O
you O
of O
some O
much O
purer O

better O
pleasure O
! O
" O
|
      | O
replied O
Percy B-PERSON
, O
indignantly O
. O
" O
No O
, O
no O
, O
Bertie B-PERSON
  O
never O
expect O
me O
to O
do O
any O
such O
thing O

would O

      | O
rather O
suffer O
the O
penalty O
of O
my O
own O
faults O
fifty B-CARDINAL
times O
over O
! O
I O
wish O
to O
heaven O
I O
were O
a O
child O

      | O
again O
, O
" O
he O
added O
with O
almost O
comic O
ruefulness O
, O
" O
and O
had O
mamma O
to O
come O
to O
me O
every B-TIME
night I-TIME
, O
as O

      | O
she O
used O
to O
do O
, O
before O
I O
went O
to O
sleep O
. O
It O
was O
so O
easy O
then O
to O
tell O
her O
all O

had O
done O
wrong O

in O
the O

the O
Saturday B-DATE

" O
Perfectly O

the O
reply O
  O
" O
poor O
young O
man O
! O
his O
appearance O

painful O
weakness O
of O

" O
Is O

" O
inquired O
Miss O
Harcourt O
  O
" O
there O
was O
something O

painful O

about O

manner O

stood O
in O
the O

" O

" O
He O
is O
slightly O
deformed O
now O
  O
but O
not O
five B-DATE
years I-DATE

he O
had O
a O
graceful O
, O
almost O
elegant O

      | O
figure O
, O
though O
always O
apparently O
too O
delicate O
for O
the O
fatiguing O
mental O
duties O
in O
which O
he O

      | O
indulged O
. O
He O
was O
of O
good O
family O
, O
but O
his O
parents O
were O
suddenly O
much O
reduced O
, O
and O
compelled O
to O

      | O
undergo O
many O
privations O
to O
enable O
him O
to O
go O
to O
Oxford B-ORG
. O
There O
he O
allowed O
himself O
neither O

      | O
relaxation O
nor O
pleasure O
of O
the O
most O
trifling O
and O
most O
harmless O
kind O
  O
his O
only O
wish O
seemed O
to O

      | O
be O
to O
repay O
his O
parents O
in O
some O
degree O
the O
heavy O
debt O
of O
gratitude O
which O
he O
felt O
he O
owed O
them O
. O

      | O
His O
persevering O
study O
, O
great O
talent O
, O
and O
remarkable O
conduct O
, O
won O
him O
some O
valuable O
friends O

      | O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
whom O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
was O
ordained O

presented O
him O
with O
a O
rich O
living O
in O
the O
North B-LOC
. O
For O
|
      | O
nine B-DATE
months I-DATE
he O
enjoyed O
the O
most O
unalloyed O
happiness O
. O
His O
pretty O
vicarage O
presented O
a O
happy O
, O

      | O
comfortable O
home O
for O
his O
parents O

and O
the O
comforts O

now O
enjoyed O

earned O
by O
the O
worth O
of O

      | O
their O
son O
, O
amply O
repaid O
them O
for O
former O
privations.—One O
cold O
snowy O
night O
he O
was O
summoned O
to O
a O

poor O
parishioner O

living O
about B-QUANTITY
ten I-QUANTITY

The O
road O
was O
rugged O
, O
and O
in O
some O
parts O

      | O
dangerous O
  O
but O
he O
was O
not O
a O
man O
to O
shrink O
from O
his O
duty O
for O
such O
reasons O

He O
was O
detained O

      | O
eight B-TIME
hours I-TIME
, O
during O
which O
time O
the O
snow O
had O
fallen O
incessantly O

it O
was O
pitchy O
dark O

Still O

      | O
believing O

his O
road O

he O
proceeded O

the B-TIME

lying O

dead O

      | O
at O
the O
foot O
of O
a O
precipice O

almost O
crushed O

An O
exclamation O

compelled O
him O

resign O
his O
rich O

beautiful O
living O
in O
Yorkshire B-GPE

felt O
himself O
once O

his O
parents O

with O

his O
figure O

once O
so O
slight O

had O
become O
so O
shrunk O

maimed O

at O
first B-ORDINAL

      | O
seemed O
actually O

His O
voice O
, O
once O
so O
rich O

almost O

      | O
thrilling O

became O
wiry O

      | O
submission O
to O
this O
inscrutable O

This O
was O

of O

earnestly O

gratefully O
accepted O

asked O
Caroline B-PERSON
  O
" O
you O
have O
never O

" O
No O
, O
my O
dear O
  O
I O
never O
saw O
him O
till O
the O
Sunday B-DATE
he O
officiated O

Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
  O
but O
his O
|
      | O
appearance O
so O
deeply O
interested O
me O
, O
I O
did O
not O
rest O
till O
I O
had O
learned O
his O
whole O
history O
, O
which O
|
      | O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
had O
already O
discovered O

has O
been O
nearly B-DATE
a I-DATE
year I-DATE
in O
Devonshire B-GPE
, O
but O
so O
kept O
aloof O
|
      | O
from O
all O
but O
his O
own O
poor O
parishioners O
, O
dreading O
the O
ridicule O
and O
sneers O
of O
the O
more O
worldly O

      | O
and O
wealthy O
, O
that O
it O
was O
mere O
accident O
which O
made O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
acquainted O
with O
him O
. O
Our O
good O
|
      | O
minister O
's O
friendship O
and O
earnest O
exhortations O
have O
so O
far O
overcome O
his O
too O
great O
|
      | O
sensitiveness O
, O
as O
sometimes O
to O
prevail O
on O
him O
to O
visit O
the O
Vicarage O
, O
and O
I O
trust O
in O
time O

      | O
equally O
to O
succeed O
in O
bringing O
him O
here O

" O
But O
what O
is O
he O
so O
afraid O
of O
, O
dear O
papa O
? O
" O
innocently O
asked O
Emmeline B-ORG

" O
Surely O
nobody O
could O
be O

      | O
so O
cruel O

him O

" O
Unfortunately O

my O

      | O
their O
preconceived O

answered O
Mrs. O

smiling O
  O
" O

Satire O

are O

      | O
unhappily O

at O
length O
exclaimed O

      | O
poor O
Percy B-PERSON
, O
so O
choked O
with O
his O
emotion O

that O
he O
could O
only O
throw O
himself O

side O

bury O

and O
sob O
for O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME

like O
a O

But O
he O
recovered O
himself O
with O
a O

      | O
strong O
effort O
, O
before O
either O
of O
his O
family O
could O
conquer O
their O
anxiety O
and O
alarm O
, O
and O
, O

      | O
standing O
erect O
, O
though O
pale O
as O
marble O
, O
without O
in O
the O
least O
degree O
attempting O
excuse O
or O
|
      | O
extenuation O
, O
acknowledged O
the O
poem O
as O
his O
, O

poured O
out O
his O
whole O
story O
, O
with O
the O
sole O

      | O
exception O
of O
how O

the O

in O
which O
he O
told O
that O

the O
fear O

seem O
like O
an O
excuse O

a O
boast O

was O
certainly O
more O

      | O
calculated O

Herbert B-PERSON

about O

an O
imploring O

      | O
Percy B-PERSON

so O
evidently O
distressed O

suffered O
so O
much O
from O
the O
consequence O
of O
his O
own O

      | O
errors O
— O
felt O
so O
intensely O
the O
unintentional O
publication O
of O

for O
his O
father O
knew O
his O

      | O
truth O
far O
too O
well O
to O
doubt O
his O
tale O
, O
and O
there O
was O
something O
so O
intrinsically O
noble O
in O
his O

      | O
brave O
confession O
, O
that O
to O
condemn O
him O
severely O

felt O
as O
if O

  O
" O
I O
am O
very O
much O
mistaken O

if O

not O

what O
Emmeline B-PERSON

" O
Only O
that O
— O
that O
— O
" O
still O
she O
hesitated O
, O
as O
if O
afraid O
to O
continue O
, O
and O
her O
mother O
added O
— O

  | O
" O
That O
papa O
will O
not O
be O
very O
angry O
with O
Percy B-PERSON

is O
not O
that O
the O
boon O

no O

      | O
courage O
to O

" O
| 
  | O
A O
still O
deeper O
glow O
mounted O
to O
the O
child O
's O
fair O
cheek O
, O
and O
throwing O
her O
arms O
round O
her O

      | O
father O
's O
neck O
, O
she O
said O
, O
coaxingly O
and O
fondly O
— O

  | O
" O
Mamma O
has O
guessed O
it O
, O
dear O
papa O
! O
you O
must O
, O
indeed O
, O
you O
must O
forgive O
him O
— O
poor O
fellow O
! O
he O
is O
|
      | O
so O
|  | O
very O
|  | O
sorry O
, O
and O
he O
has O
suffered O
so O
much O
already O
— O
and O
he O
did O
not O
throw O
away O
his O

      | O
money O
foolishly O
, O
as O
you O
thought O
  O
he O
gave O
it O
to O
some O
very O
poor O
people O

you O
are O
always O

      | O
pleased O
when O
we O
are O
charitable O

forget O
every O
thing O
else O

that O

treat O
him O

always O

will O
you O
not O

" O

" O
I O
wonder O
which O
is O
most O
certain O
— O
that O
mamma O

be O
a O
witch O
, O
or O
Emmeline B-ORG
a O
most O
eloquent O

      | O
little O
pleader O
, O

said O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
caressingly O
stroking O
the O
ringlets O
she O
had O
disordered O

      | O
suppose O
, O
after O
to O

day O

I O
do O
grant O
your O

exclaimed O
Emmeline B-PRODUCT
, O
almost O
suffocating O

      | O
him O
with O
kisses O
, O
and O
then O
starting O
from O
his O
knee O
, O
she O
danced O
about O
the O
room O
in O
a O
perfect O

      | O
ecstasy O
of O
delight O
  O
" O

now O
, O
Emmeline B-PERSON
, O
when O
you O
have O
danced O
yourself O
sober O
again O

back O

In O
an O

" O
In O
the O
first B-ORDINAL

you O

justified O

are O
doing O

it O

Meanwhile O
the O
young O
heir O
of O
Oakwood B-ORG
had O
passed O
no O
very O
pleasant O
day O
. O
His O
thoughts O
since O
Mr. O
|
      | O
Howard B-PERSON
's O
return O
had O
been O
so O
pre O
- O
occupied O
, O
that O
his O
studies O
had O
been O
unusually O
neglected O
  O
so O
|
      | O
much O
so O
, O
as O
rather O
to O
excite O
the O
displeasure O
of O
his O
gentle O
and O
forbearing O
preceptor O
. O
The O
|
      | O
emotion O
of O
the O
morning O
had O
not O
tended O
to O
steady O
his O
ideas O
, O
and O
a O
severe O
reproof O
and O
long O
|
      | O
imposition O
was O
the O
consequence O
. O
Not O
one O
word O
did O
he O
deign O
to O
address O
Herbert B-PERSON
and O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
who O
, O

      | O
perceiving O
him O
leave O
the O
Vicarage O
with O
every O
mark O
of O
irritation O
, O
endeavored O
, O
during O
their O
walk O
|
      | O
home O
, O
to O
soothe O
him O
. O
His O
step O
was O
even O
more O
rapid O
than O
that O
in O
which O
he O
had O
left O
home O
, O
and O
he O
|
      | O
neither O
stopped O
nor O
spoke O
till O
he O
had O
reached O
his O
father O
's O
library O
, O
which O
, O
fortunately O
for O
the O
|
      | O
indulgence O
of O
his O
ire O
in O
words O
, O
was O
untenanted O
. O
He O
dashed O
his O
cap O
from O
his O
brow O
, O
flung O
his O
|
      | O
books O
with O
violence O
on O
the O
ground O
, O
and O
burst O
forth O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
Am O
I O
not O
a O
fool O
— O
an O
idiot O
, O
thus O
to O
torment O
myself O
, O
and O
for O
one O
act O
of O
folly O
, O
when O
hundreds B-CARDINAL

what O
they O

      | O
please O
— O
neither O
questioned O

reproved O

and O
that O
poem O
— O
how O

would O
glory O

its O

, O

      | O
and O
not O
care O

Why O
am O
I O
such O

as O
to O
reproach O
myself O
about O
it O

      | O
and O
then O
be O
punished O

like O
a O
school O

boy O
, O
with O
an O
imposition O
to O
occupy O
me O
at O
home O

because O
I O

      | O
did O
not O

in O
the B-TIME

I O
wish O
Mr. O

But O
why O
am O
I O
so O
cowed O
as O

so O

Why O
can O
not O
I O
have O
the O

" O
Percy O

" O
exclaimed O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
who O
, O
having O
sought O
him O
the O
moment O
she O
heard O
the O
hall O
- O
door O
|
      | O
close O
, O
had O
heard O
nearly O
the O
whole O
of O
his O
violent O
speech O
, O
and O
was O
almost O
alarmed O
at O
the O
unusual O
|
      | O
passion O
it O
evinced O
. O
Her O
voice O
of O
astonished O
expostulation O
checked O
his O
words O
, O
but O
not O
his O
|
      | O
agitation O
  O
he O
threw O
himself O
on O
a O
chair O
, O
leaning O
his O
arms O
upon O
the O
table O
, O
buried O
his O
face O
upon O
|
      | O
them O
, O
while O
his O
whole O
frame O
shook O
. O
His O
mother O
sat O
down O
by O
him O
, O
and O
laying O
her O
hand O
on O
his O
arm O
, O
|
      | O
said O
gently O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
What O
is O
it O
that O
has O
so O
irritated O
you O
, O
my O
dear O
Percy B-PERSON
? O
What O
has O
made O
you O
return O
home O
in O
such O
|
      | O
a O
very O
different O
mood O
to O
that O
in O
which O
you O
left O
it O
? O
Tell O
me O
, O
my O
boy O

" O
| 
  | O
Percy B-PERSON
tried O
to O
keep O
silence O
, O
for O
he O
knew O
if O
he O
spoke O
he O
should O
, O
as O
he O
expressed O
it O
, O
be O
a O
|
      | O
child O
again O
, O
and O
his O
pride O
tried O
hard O
for O
victory O
. O
Even O
his O
father O
or O
Herbert B-PERSON
at O
that O
moment O
|
      | O
would O
have O
chafed O
him O
into O
increased O
anger O
, O
but O
the O
almost O
passionate O
love O
and O
reverence O
which O
|
      | O
he O
felt O
for O
his O
mother O
triumphed O
over O
his O
wrath O
, O
and O
told O
him O
he O
was O
much O
more O
unhappy O
than O
|
      | O
angry O
  O
and O
that O
he O
longed O
for O
her O
to O
comfort O
him O
, O
as O
she O
always O
had O
done O
in O
his O
childish O
|
      | O
griefs O
  O
and O
so O
he O
put O
his O
arms O
round O
her O
, O
and O
laid O
his O
head O
on O
her O
shoulder O
and O
said O
, O
in O
a O
|
      | O
half B-CARDINAL
- O
choked O
voice O
: O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
am O
very O
unhappy O
, O
mother O
  O
I O
feel O
as O
if O
I O
had O
been O
every O
thing O
that O
was O
bad O
, O
and O
cruel O
, O
and O
|
      | O
foolish O
, O
and O
so O
it O
was O
a O
relief O
to O
be O
in O
a O
passion O
  O
but O
I O
did O
not O
mean O
you O
to O
hear O
it O
, O
and O
|
      | O
cause O
you O
more O
grief O
than O
I O
have O
done O
already O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
You O
have O
been O
very O
thoughtless O
, O
very O
foolish O
, O
and O
not O
quite O
so O
firm O
as O
we O
could O
have O

      | O
wished O
, O
my O
own O
dear O
boy O

I O
will O
not O
have O
you O
accuse O
yourself O
of O
any O
graver O
faults O
, O
" O
|
      | O
replied O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
as O
she O
lightly O
pushed O
back O
the O
clustering O
hair O
from O
his O
heated O
|
      | O
forehead O
, O
and O
the O
gentle O
touch O
of O
her O
cool O
hand O
seemed O
as O
restorative O
as O
her O
soothing O
words O
  O
|
      | O
and O
Percy B-PERSON
, O
as O
he O
listened O
to O
her O
, O
as O
she O
continued O
speaking O
to O
him O
in O
the O
same O
strain O
for O
some O
|
      | O
little O
time O
, O
felt O
more O
relieved O
than O
five B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
before O
he O
thought O
possible O
, O
and O
more O
than O
|
      | O
ever O
determined O
that O
he O
would O
never O
act O
so O
thoughtlessly O
  O
or O
, O
if O
he O
were O
tempted O
to O
do O
so O
, O
|
      | O
never O
keep O
it O
concealed O
so O
long O
again O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
's O
anxious O
desire O
with O
him O
was O
, O
always O
to O
|
      | O
do O
justice O
to O
his O
better O
qualities O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
that O
she O
blamed O
and O
convinced O
him O
of O
his O
|
      | O
faults O
. O
It O
was O
a O
very O
delicate O
thing O
, O
and O
very O
difficult O
to O
succeed O
in O
, O
perhaps O
impossible O
to O

      | O
minds O
less O
peculiarly O
refined O

and O
hearts O
less O
intensely O
anxious O

Mrs. O

's O
  O
but O
no O
|
      | O
difficulty O
, O
no O
failure O

had O
ever O
deterred O
her O
— O
and O
in O
Percy B-PERSON
she O
was O
already O
rewarded O
. O
He O
was O
of O

      | O
that O
high O
, O
fine O
spirit O
, O
that O
any O
unjust O
harshness O
would O
have O
actually O
confirmed O
in O
error O
— O
any O

      | O
unguarded O
word O
bring O
argument O
on O
argument O
, O
and O
so O
, O
for O
the O
mere O

of O
opposition O
, O
cause O
him O
|
      | O
to O
abide O
in O
his O
opinions O
, O
when O
the O
acknowledgment O
of O
his O
being O
right O
in O
some O
things O
, O
produced O

      | O
the O
voluntary O
confession O
of O
his O
error O
in O
others O
. O

" O

now O
about O
these O
unfortunate O
verses O

my O

how O
it O

He O
looked O
at O
her O
in O
utter O
bewilderment O
. O

" O
Do O
both O

mother O

he O
repeated O

" O
Yes O
, O
my O
boy O
! O
it O
is O
a O
painful O
remedy O

it O
would O
be O
an O
effectual O

Mr. O
Morton B-PERSON
, O

      | O
tell O
him O
yourself O
your O
whole O

Percy B-PERSON
crimsoned O
to O
the O
very O
temples O
. O

  | O
" O
Do O
not O
ask O
me O
such O
a O
thing O
, O
mother O
, O
" O
he O
answered O
very O
hurriedly O
  O
" O
I O
can O
not O
do O
it O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
You O
think O
so O
at O
this O
moment O
, O
my O
dear O
boy O
  O
I O
am O
not O
at O
all O
astonished O
that O
you O
should O
, O
for O
|
      | O
it O
will O
be O
very O
humiliating O
, O
and O
very O
painful O
  O
and O
if O
I O
could O
spare O
you O
either O
the O
humiliation O
|
      | O
or O
the O
pain O
, O
yet O
produce O
the O
same O
good O
effects O
, O
I O
need O
not O
tell O
you O
how O
gladly O
I O
would O
  O
but O
no O
|
      | O
one O
can O
remove O
the O
sting O
of O
that O
poem O
from O
Mr. O
Morton B-PERSON
's O
sensitive O
feelings O
but O
yourself O
  O
and O
I O
|
      | O
am O
quite O
sure O
if O
you O
will O
allow O
yourself O
a O
little O
time O
for O
quiet O
thought O
, O
you O
will O
agree O
with O
|
      | O
me O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
But O
why O
should O
I O
inflict O
such O
pain O
upon O
myself O
, O
granting O
I O
deserve O
it O
? O
" O
answered O
Percy B-PERSON
, O
|
      | O
still O
much O
heated O
  O
" O
when O
, O
though O
my O
poem O
is O
the O
only O
one O
that O
has O
unfortunately O
met O
his O
eye O
, O
|
      | O
the O
others O
were O
quite O
as O
galling O
, O
and O
my O
companions O
quite O
as O
much O
to O
blame O
— O
why O
should O
I O
be O
the O
|
      | O
sufferer O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Because O
, O
by O
many O
errors O
, O
you O
have O
brought O
it O
on O
yourself O
. O
Your O
companions O
did O
indeed O
act O
|
      | O
very O
wrongly O
, O
but O
are O
we O
quite O
sure O
that O
the O
principles O
which O
your O
father O

Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
have O

      | O
so O
carefully O
impressed O

carefully O
impressed O

in O
such O
a O

      | O
case O
are O
not O
you O
the O
more O
responsible O

They O
had O
evidently O
no O
inward O
check O
to O
keep O
them O
from O

      | O
such O
an O
amusement O

you O
had O
, O
for O
you O
have O
acknowledged O
that O
you O
kept O
aloof O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
|
        | O
knowing O
it O
was O
wrong O

, O
and O
only O
yielded O
from O
want O
of O
sufficient O
firmness O
. O
Inflict O
the O
|
      | O
pain O
of O
an O
avowal O
upon O
yourself O
, O
my O
boy O
, O
and O
its O
memory O
will O
help O
you O
in O
future O
from O
yielding O
|
      | O
to O
too O
great O
weakness O
— O
and O
the O
act O
prove O
to O
us O
that O
, O
though O
for O
a O
moment O
led O
into O
great O
error O
, O
|
      | O
you O
are O
still O
as O
brave O
and O
honest O
as O
we O
believe O
you O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Percy B-PERSON
did O
not O
reply O
, O
but O
his O
countenance O
denoted O
an O
inward O
struggle O
, O
and O
his O
mother O

      | O
added O
— O

Suppose O
, O
as O
is O
very O
likely O
, O
Mr. O

becomes O
intimate O

can O
you O

perfectly O

      | O
satisfied O
that O

that O

my O

that O
I O
lay O
no O

you O
to O

      | O
seek O
Mr. O
Morton B-PERSON
  O
I O
have O
only O
told O
you O
that O
which O
I O
believe O

restore O
you O
to O
happiness O

      | O
atone O

She O
left O

some B-TIME

Emmeline B-PERSON
felt O
the O

rising O
to O

could O
not O

to O

who O
was O
in O

the O

so O
silent O

Sliding O
after O

sauntered O
through O
the O

the O

      | O
direction O
of O
the O
northern O
lodge O

overtaken O
by O

riding O
at O
what O

      | O
seemed O
almost O
a O
hand O
gallop O

he O
had O
time O

passed O
his O
mother O

gracefully O
doff O
his O

      | O
cap O

her O
fond O

throbbed O

out O

another O

who O
had O
not O

nearly O
a O
fortnight O

was O
in O
an O
ecstasy O

of O
enjoyment O

Ellen B-PERSON

felt O
it O
a O

pleasure O
quietly O
to O

side O

answer O

at O
the O
even O
more O

ordinary O
warmth O
with O

her O

      | O
the O
flush O

stained O
his O

as O
she O
looked O
at O
him O

her O
eyes O
glistened O

" O
Oh O
, O
not O
in O
the O
least O
, O
" O
he O
replied O
instantly O
, O

as O
if O
he O
would O
exceedingly O
like O
to O
change O

      | O
the O
subject O
  O

Mrs. O
Greville B-PERSON

turning O
to O
Mrs. O

continued O
— O

you O
forgive O

Emmeline B-PERSON

more O

after O
your O

even O
to O
see O
you O

I O
was O
so O
anxious O
to O
know O
that O
he O
had O
suffered O
no O

smiling O

I O

more O

who O
, O
from O
being O

sought O
the O
worst O

I O
can O
not O
think O
what O
charm O
Herbert B-PERSON
used O

Alfred B-PERSON
was O
quite O
contented O
to O
be O
with O

him O

dined O
together O

brought O
me O
what O

next O

my O

was O
the O
greatest O
consolation O

could O
have O

" O

      | O
interposed O
Mrs. O
Greville B-PERSON
, O
her O
voice O
so O
faltering O
, O
that O
tears O
almost O
escaped,—"a O
few O
lines O
|
      | O
which O
, O
he O
assures O
me O
, O
Alfred B-PERSON
thought O
of O
writing O
himself O
, O
telling O
me O
, O
he O
could O
not O
bear O
to O

      | O
think O
he O
had O
left O
home O
without O
kissing O
me O
, O

that O
, O
though O
he O
was O
so O
happy O
with O
his O
father O
, O

      | O
that O
he O
could O
not O
wish O
to O
return O
home O

he O
still O
loved O
me O
and O
Mary B-PERSON
very O
, O
very O
much O
, O
and O
would O

      | O
continue O

love O
us O

see O
us O

. O
Oh O
, O
Emmeline B-PERSON
, O
can O
you O
not O
imagine O
|
      | O
the O
relief O
of O
such O
a O
letter O
, O
of O
hearing O
of O
him O
at O
all O
? O
and O
it O
was O
all O
through O
the O
kindness O
, O
|
      | O
the O
goodness O
of O
your O
boy O
! O
" O

  | O
When O
Mrs. O
Greville B-PERSON
and O
Mary B-PERSON
had O
first B-ORDINAL
begun O
to O
speak O
, O
Herbert B-PERSON
tried O
to O
retreat O
  O
but O
Edward B-PERSON

      | O
placing O
himself O
against O
the O
door O
, O
so O
that O
to O
open O
it O
was O
impossible O
, O
and O
Caroline B-GPE

      | O
Emmeline B-ORG
, O
both O
at O
once O
catching O
hold O

keep O
him O
prisoner O
, O

was O
not O

      | O
thought O
of O
  O
so O
, O
in O
laughing O
despair O
, O
he O
broke O
from O
his O
sisters O
, O
flung O
himself O
on O
his O
usual O
|
      | O
seat O
, O
his O
mother O
's O
stool O
, O

almost O
hid O
himself O
in O
her O
dress O
. O

  | O
" O
It O
must O
have O
been O
a O
relief O

indeed O
, O
" O
answered O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
  O
" O
and O
rejoiced O
am O
I O
that O
my O

      | O
quiet O
Herbert B-PERSON

Master O
Shamefaced O

tell O
us O
the O
reason O
of O

      | O
your O
most O
extraordinary O
mystery O
on O
this O
occasion O

Why O
did O
you O
so O
carefully O
conceal O
your O
|
      | O
intentions O
from O
your O
mother O
and O
myself O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Because O
, O
papa O
, O
I O
feared O
you O
might O
not O
approve O
of O
them O
  O
I O
hardly O
dared O
think O
about O
it O
|
      | O
myself O
, O
for O
it O
seemed O
as O
if O
I O
were O
doing O
actually O
wrong O
in O
disregarding O
your O
principles O
, O
for O
|
      | O
only O
the O
|  | O
chance O
|  | O
of O
effecting O
good O
. O
I O
know O
, O
if O
I O
had O
mentioned O
my O
wish O
to O
find O
Alfred B-ORG
, O
|
      | O
or O
hear O
something O
about O
him O
, O
you O
would O
not O
have O
refused O
my O
going O
  O
but O
then O
mamma O
must O
have O
|
      | O
known O
it O
, O
and O
she O
would O
have O
been O
anxious O
and O
uncomfortable O
, O
if O
I O
had O
not O
appeared O
the O
very O
|
      | O
moment O
I O
had O
named O
  O
would O
you O
not O
? O
" O
he O
continued O
, O
looking O
up O
in O
her O
face O
with O
that O
expression O
|
      | O
of O
affection O
, O
which O
very O
few O
, O
even O
comparative O
strangers O
, O
had O
power O
to O
remit O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
should O
indeed O
, O
my O
dear O
boy O
  O
I O
fear O
I O
should O
have O
condemned O
your O
scheme O
as O
a O
very O
wild O

      | O
one O
, O
and O
really O
am O
glad O
you O
thought O
so O
much O
of O
my O
comfort O
, O
as O
not O
to O
tell O
me O
more O
than O
you O

      | O
did O
. O
So O
I O
must O
not O
even O
be O
jealous O
, O
Jessie B-PERSON
, O
but O
rather O
propose O
a O
vote O
of O
thanks O
to O
you O
and O

      | O
Mary B-PERSON
for O
solving O
the O
mystery O
. O
I O
do O
not O
think O
Herbert B-PERSON
ever O
excited O
so O
much O
curiosity O

      | O
speculation O
, O
in O
his O
life O

before O

" O

  | O
The O
entrance O
of O
Mr. O
Grahame B-PERSON
changed O
the O
current O
of O
the O
conversation O
, O
greatly O
to O
Herbert B-PERSON
's O
|
      | O
relief O
, O
for O
he O
did O
not O
at O
all O
like O
being O
thus O
brought O
forward O
. O
Austere O
as O
Grahame B-PERSON
was O
at O
home O
, O

      | O
he O
was O
always O
welcomed O
with O
pleasure O
by O
the O
young O
Hamiltons B-WORK_OF_ART
, O
who O
never O
could O
understand O
why O

      | O
Annie B-ORG

Cecil I-ORG
should O
so O
fear O
him O
. O
That O
something O
unusual O
had O
annoyed O
him O
, O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
|
      | O
perceived O
at O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
glance O
  O
but O
he O
took O
no O
notice O
, O
for O
Grahame B-PERSON
seemed O
to O
find O
relief O
in O
|
      | O
talking O
gayly O
to O
the O
young O
people O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
And O
where O
is O
my O
friend O
Percy B-PERSON
? O
" O
he O
inquired O
, O
as O
he O
joined O
the O
happy O
group O
at O
tea O
, O
and O
Percy B-PERSON

      | O
was O
still O
absent O
. O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
repeated O
the O
question O
in O
some O
surprise O
  O
but O
his O
wife O
replying O

      | O
that O
he O
had O
gone O
to O
ride O

might O
not O

back O

dropped O

After O
tea O
, O
Mrs. O
Greville B-PERSON

Mary B-PERSON
, O
attended O
by O
Herbert B-PERSON

Edward B-PERSON

returned O
to O
the O
Manor B-GPE
  O

      | O
and O
the O
little O

went O

finish O
some O
business O

the B-DATE
next I-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
and O
amuse O
themselves O
as O

      | O
they O
liked O
. O
Grahame O
remained O
alone O
with O
his O
friends O
, O
who O
at O
length O
drew O
from O
him O
the O
cause O
of O
|
      | O
his O
solicitude O
. O
He O
had O
that O
morning B-TIME
discovered O
, O
that O
, O
notwithstanding O
his O
positive O
commands O
, O
|
      | O
Cecil O
had O
gone O
to O
the O
prohibited O
places O
of O
amusement O
. O
His O
wife O
had O
prevaricated O
when O
he O
|
      | O
questioned O
her O
  O
at O
one B-CARDINAL
moment O
almost O
denying O
her O
connivance O
at O
the O
boy O
's O
disobedience O
, O
at O
|
      | O
another O
unconsciously O
acknowledging O
it O
, O
by O
insisting O
that O
there O
was O
no O
harm O
in O
it O
  O
and O
if O
|
      | O
Grahame O
would O
persist O
in O
so O
interfering O
with O
his O
children O
's O
amusements O
, O
he O
must O
expect O
to O
be O
|
      | O
disobeyed O
. O
If O
such O
were O
his O
home O
, O
where O
was O
he O
to O
look O
for O
truth O
, O
honor O
, O
and O
affection O
? O
What O

      | O
would O
be O
his O
son O

after O
career O
, O
if O
such O
were O
the O
lessons O
of O
his O
childhood O
? O
He O
had O
punished O
|
      | O
him O
severely O
, O
but O
there O
was O
little O
hope O
of O
its O
producing O
any O
good O
effect O
, O
when O
his O
wife O
was O
|
      | O
yet O
more O
to O
blame O
than O
his O
child O
. O
It O
would O
only O
alienate O
the O
boy O
's O
affections O
still O
more O
from O
|
      | O
him O
. O
Yet O
what O
could O
he O
do O
? O
Could O
he O
let O
such O
disobedience O
and O
untruthfulness O
— O
for O
Cecil O
had O
|
      | O
denied O
his O
having O
been O
at O
the O
races O
— O
pass O
unnoticed O
? O
He O
had O
shut O
himself O
up O
in O
his O
library O
the O
|
      | O
remainder O
of O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
  O
but O
at O
length O
, O
unable O
to O
bear O
his O
own O
thoughts O
, O
had O
walked O
over O
to O

      | O
Oakwood B-ORG

feeling O
sure O
, O
if O
peace O

found O

he O
should O
find O
it O
there O

  | O
Their O
sympathy O
it O
was O
easy O
for O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
to O
give O
— O
for O
they O
felt O
it O
sincerely O
— O
but O
|
      | O
to O
advise O
was O
both O
delicate O
and O
difficult O
. O
To O
interfere O
in O
a O
household O
is O
not O
the O
part O
even O
of O

      | O
the O
most O
intimate O
friends O
. O
And O
when O
Lady B-PERSON
Helen I-PERSON
herself O
encouraged O
the O
boy O
in O
his O
disobedience O
, O
|
      | O
and O
showed O
him O
an O
example O
of O
equivocation O

what O
could O
be O
said O
? O
Grahame O
could O
not O
bear O
the O
idea O

      | O
of O
a O
public O
school O
for O
a O
boy O
scarcely O
eleven B-CARDINAL

whose O
home O

influence O
was O
so O
injurious O
, O
and O
|
      | O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
could O
not O
advise O
it O
. O
He O
tried O
, O
therefore O
, O
merely O
to O
raise O
the O
depressed O
spirits O
|
      | O
of O
his O
friend O
, O
bringing O
forward O
many O
instances O
, O
when O
even O
the O
best O
training O
failed O
  O
and O
others O

      | O
where O
the O
faults O
of O
childhood O
were O
subdued O
by O
circumstances O
, O
and O
became O
fair O
promising O
youth O
. O
|
      | O
Grahame O
shook O
his O
head O
despondingly O
. O

" O

can O

be O
a O
fit O
judge O
of O
my O
trial O

" O
he O
said O
  O
" O

added O
hurriedly O

met O
a O
glance O
of O
reproach O
from O
Mrs. O

turned O

      | O
but O
reluctantly O
  O
for O
he O
was O
more O
particular O
that O
every O
member O
of O
his O
household O
should O
assemble O
|
      | O
at O
the O
stated O
hour B-TIME
of O
prayer O
, O
than O
in O
any O
other O
point O
relating O
to O
his O
establishment O
. O
Scarcely O
, O
|
      | O
however O
, O
had O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
word O
been O
said O
, O
when O
Percy B-PERSON
and O
Robert B-PERSON
entered O
, O
and O
the O
former O
, O
with O
a O
|
      | O
very O
rapid O
, O
but O
noiseless O
step O
, O
traversed O
the O
large O
room O
, O
and O
kneeled O
in O
his O
accustomed O
place O
. O
|
      | O
In O
vain O
did O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
try O
to O
keep O
her O
thoughts O
fixed O
on O
the O
service O
. O
Had O
he O
really O
been O
to O
|
      | O
Mr. O
Morton B-PERSON
, O
and O
if O
he O
had O
, O
how O
had O
he O
been O
received O
? O
had O
his O
fine O
spirit O
been O
soothed O
or O
|
      | O
irritated O
? O
and O
a B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
other O
nameless O
but O
natural O
fears O
thronged O
her O
heart O
. O
But O
one B-CARDINAL
look O
on O
|
      | O
her O
son O
as O
he O
rose O
reassured O
her O
  O
his O
cheek O
was O
flushed O
with O
rapid O
riding O
, O
but O
his O
dark O
eye O
|
      | O
sparkled O
, O
and O
he O
looked O
more O
bright O
and O
joyous O
than O
he O
had O
done O
for O
weeks B-DATE
. O
He O
advanced O
without O
|
      | O
hesitation O
to O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
the O
moment O
the O
domestics O
had O
quitted O
the O
library O
and O
said O
, O
eagerly O
, O
|
      | O
but O
still O
respectfully O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
Will O
you O
, O
too O
, O
forgive O
me O
, O
my O
dear O
father O
? O
Mr. O
Morton B-PERSON
knows O
the O
whole O
truth O
, O
and O
has O
not O
|
      | O
only O
pardoned O
my O
cruel O
folly O
, O
but O
assured O
me O
, O
that O
I O
have O
more O
than O
atoned O
for O
the O
pain O
my O
|
      | O
hateful O
verses O
inflicted O
  O
that O
he O
will O
laugh O
at O
them O
himself O
and O
declare O
he O
knows O
their O
author O
|
      | O
as O
a O
most O
particular O
friend O
— O
which O
he O
hopes O
you O
will O
permit O
me O
to O
become O
— O
whenever O
he O
has O
the O
|
      | O
opportunity O
  O
for O
that O
such O
notice O
of O
them O
will O
be O
the O
surest O
way O
to O
consign O
them O
to O
oblivion O
. O
|
      | O
I O
have O
endured O
so O
much O
pain O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
few I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
that O
I O
do O
not O
think O
I O
shall O
be O
so O
thoughtless O
|
      | O
and O
weak O
in O
a O
hurry O
again O
. O
Will O
you O
try O
me O
once O
more O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
Astonished O
and O
touched O
, O
far O
more O
than O
he O
was O
ever O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
allowing O
himself O
to O
feel O
, O
|
      | O
much O
less O
to O
display O
, O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
had O
some O
difficulty O
in O
replying O
  O
but O
his O
words O
were O
even O
|
      | O
more O
than O
satisfactory O
to O
his O
son O
's O
eager O
heart O
, O
for O
he O
answered O
earnestly O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
Pray O
, O
do O
not O
give O
me O
any O
praise O
for O
my O
courage O
, O
papa O
  O
I O
am O
quite O
sure O
, O
if O
it O
had O
not O
been O
|
      | O
for O
mamma O
's O
suggestion O
, O
I O
never O
could O
have O
done O
it O
. O
It O
might O
have O
crossed O
my O
mind O
, O
but O
I O
fear O
|
      | O
pride O
would O
not O
have O
permitted O
me O
to O
listen O
to O
it O
  O
but O
when O
mamma O
put O
the O
case O
before O
me O
as O
|
      | O
she O
did O
, O
I O
could O
not O
prevent O
my O
conscience O
from O
feeling O
the O
truth O
of O
all O
she O
said O
, O
and O
if O
I O
|
      | O
had O
not O
followed O
her O
advice O
, O
I O
should O
have O
been O
more O
miserable O
still O
. O
Dearest O
mother O
, O
" O
he O
|
      | O
continued O
, O
as O
he O
turned O
with O
even O
more O
than O
his O
usual O
affection O
to O
receive O
her O
nightly O
|
      | O
embrace O
, O
" O
you O
have O
made O
me O
so O
happy O
! O
how O
can O
I O
thank O
you O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
If O
she O
made O
him O
happy O
, O
he O
certainly O
had O
returned O
the O
blessing O
, O
for O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
had O
seldom O
|
      | O
felt O
more O
exquisite O
pleasure O
than O
she O
did O
at O
that O
moment O
  O
and O
her O
little O
Emmeline B-PRODUCT
, O
though O
she O
|
      | O
could O
not O
quite O
understand O
all O
her O
mother O
's O
feelings O
, O
felt O
, O
in O
her O
way O
, O
almost O
as O
glad O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Well O
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
will O
not O
your O
son O
's O
words O
confirm O
mine O
? O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Grahame B-PERSON
trying O
to O
|
      | O
speak O
cheerfully O
, O
when O
the O
young O
party O
had O
retired O
, O
and O
he O
was O
again O
alone O
with O
his O
friends O
. O
|
      | O
" O
Can O
he O
go O
far O
wrong O
with O
such O
a O
friend O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Indeed O
, O
he O
has O
done O
me O
more O
than O
justice O
, O
and O
himself O
not O
enough O
. O
When O
I O
left O
him O
, O
I O
had O
|
      | O
scarcely O
a O
hope O
that O
my O
very O
disagreeable O
advice O
would O
be O
followed O
  O
besides O
, O
Mr. O
Grahame B-PERSON
, O
" O
she O
|
      | O
added O
, O
more O
playfully O
, O
" O
it O
was O
not O
from O
disagreeing O
with O
you O
on O
a O
mother O
's O
influence O
that O
my O
|
      | O
look O
reproached O
you O
, O
you O
know O
well O
enough O
what O
it O
meant O
  O
and O
I O
still O
say O
, O
that O
even O
now O
, O
if O
|
      | O
you O
would O
but O
be O
less O
reserved O
and O
stern O
, O
would O
but O
see O
Helen B-PERSON
's O
many O
better O
qualities O
, O
as O
|
      | O
clearly O
as O
you O
do O
her O
faults O
, O
you O
might O
still O
win O
her O
to O
your O
will O
even O
with O
regard O
to O
your O

      | O
children O

" O
| 
  | O
" O
Not O
now O
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
it O
is O
too O
late O
  O
but O
you O
have O
no O
idea O
how O
your O
look O
transported O
me O

      | O
back O
to O
years B-DATE
past O
, O
" O
he O
added O
, O
evidently O
resolved O
to O
change O
the O
subject O
, O
" O
when O
I O
actually O
|
      | O
almost O
feared O
to O
approach O
you O
. O
Do O
you O
remember O
, O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
when O
I O
told O
you O
, O
if O
Miss B-PERSON
Manvers I-PERSON
had O
|
      | O
a O
fault O
, O
she O
was O
too O
cold O
? O
" O

" O
I O
shall O
not O
easily O
forget O
the O
incidents O
of O
that B-TIME
night I-TIME
, O
" O
replied O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
fond O
|
      | O
glance O
toward O
his O
wife O
. O
" O
Poor O
Eleanor O
, O
when O
her O
conduct O
that O
evening B-TIME
fell O
under O
my O
lash O
, O
I O
|
      | O
little O
thought O
her O
orphan O
children O
would O
be O
living O
under O
my O
roof O
, O

to O
me O
almost O
like O
my O

own O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
And O
one B-CARDINAL
her O
very O
image O
, O
" O
observed O
Grahame B-PERSON
. O
" O
Does O
either O
resemble O
her O
in O
mind O

      | O
disposition O

" O
| 
  | O
" O
Edward O
almost O
as O
much O
in O
mind O
as O
in O
personal O
beauty O
, O

replied O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
  O
" O
But O
not O
in O

      | O
all O
points O
of O
his O
disposition O

Ellen B-PERSON
does O
not O
resemble O
her O
poor O
mother O

any O

" O

" O
Is O
she O

" O
I O
did O
not O
know O
him O
sufficiently O
to O
judge O
, O

I O
fancy O
not.—In O
fact O

I O
hardly O

      | O
Ellen B-PERSON

" O
| 
  | O
" O
Indeed O

answered O
Grahame B-PERSON

smiling O
  O
" O
is O
your O
penetrative O
genius O
here O
at O
fault O

" O
I O
fear O
it O

she O
answered O
, O
in O
the O
same O
tone O
  O
" O
Ellen B-PERSON
is O
my O
youngest O
child O

that O
which O

      | O
has O
been O
my O
successful O
help O
five B-CARDINAL
times O

has O
become O
blunted O
at O
the O
sixth B-ORDINAL

" O

" O
Grahame O
, O
do O
not O
heed O
her O
, O
" O
interposed O
her O
husband O
, O
laughing O
  O
" O
she O
fancies O
there O
is O

      | O
something O
extraordinary O
about O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
which O
she O
can O
not O
comprehend O
  O
and O
I O
feel O
certain O
that O

      | O
imagination O
has O
been O
playing O
with O
my O
wife O

sober O
judgment O
, O
and O
that O
our O
little O
niece O
is O
a O

      | O
very O
ordinary O
child O
, O
only O
rather O
more O
sad O
and O
quiet O
than O
is O
usual O
at O
her O
age O
, O
which O
may O
be O

      | O
easily O
accounted O
for O
by O
her O
early O
trials O

constant O
ill O

health O

So O
I O
solve O
what O
my O
wife O

      | O
pronounces O
a O
mystery O

She O
has O
so O
few O
fancies O
, O
however O
, O
that O
I O
do O
not O
quarrel O
with O
this O
, O
for O
it O

      | O
has O
all O
the O
charm O
of O
novelty O
. O
" O
|

There O
were O
more O
than O
usual O
subjects O

Praise B-PERSON
lavished O
on O
others O

      | O
never O
gave O
her O
pleasure O
: O
the O
question O
would O
always O
come O
, O
Why O
did O
she O
not O
receive O
it O
too O
? O
It O
|
      | O
was O
very O
hard O
that O
she O
so O
seldom O
received O
it O
, O

self O
- O
love O
was O
always O
ready O
to O
accuse O
her O

      | O
parents O
of O
some O
degree O
of O
partiality O
rather O
than O
herself O
of O
unworthiness O

But O
these O
thoughts O

      | O
only O
came O
when O
she O
was O

the O

Ellen B-PERSON

mostly O
of O

had O
been O

about O
it O

that O
it O
was O
for O

weight O

the O
penalty O
of O
his O
faults O

He O
had O
never O

therefore O
could O
not O

understand O

her O

their O
nature O

the O
absence O

      | O
the O
young O

from O

happy O

either O
at O

hours B-TIME

      | O
such O
an O
unusual O
proceeding O
was O
necessary O
, O
in O
consequence O
, O
never O
excited O
any O
remark O

but O
a O
very O
|
      | O
general O
feeling O
of O
regret O
. O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
therefore O
, O
scarcely O
ever O
heard O
the O
actual O
cause O
of O
his O

      | O
sister O

disgrace O
, O
and O
sometimes O
did O
not O
even O
know O
she O
had O
incurred O
it O
. O
He O
did O
, O
indeed O
, O
when O
|
      | O
she O
was O
sometimes O
absent O
, O
feel O
very O
uncomfortable O
  O

his O
immovable O
awe O
of O
his O
really O

      | O
indulgent O
uncle O
( O

idea O
of O

sanctity O

caused O
him O
to O
adopt O
every O
means O
of O
removing O
the O
uncomfortable O
|
      | O
consciousness O
that O
he O
was O
far O
more O
to O
blame O
than O
Ellen B-PERSON

but O
the O
right O
one O
, O
a O
fearless O
inquiry O
|
      | O
as O
to O
why O
she O
was O
punished O
, O
and O
an O
open O
avowal O
that O
it O
was O
he O
who O
had O
either O
led O
her O
into O
|
      | O
error O

or O
was O
the O
real O

      | O
of O

" O
No O

aloud O

the O
energy O

season O
was O
to O
their O
feelings O
of O
religion O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
earnest O
, O
intense O
thankfulness O
, O

      | O
and O
they O
wished O
to O
make O
it O
equally O
so O
to O
their O
children O
— O
a O
source O
of O
joy O
and O
hope O
indeed O
, O
but O

      | O
the O
joy O

hope O
of O
Heaven O
, O
not O
the O
mere O
amusements O
and O
pleasures O
of O

They O
had O
thought O

      | O
long O
and O
tried O
earnestly O
to O
make O
their O
children O
so O
to O
love O
serious O
things O
, O
as O
never O
to O

      | O
associate O
them O
with O
gloom O
or O
sadness O
— O
never O
to O
fancy O
that O
to O
be O
truly O
and O
spiritually O
religious O

      | O
demanded O
a O
relinquishment O
of O
the O
joys O

pleasures O

innocent O
happiness O
of O
their O

Christmas B-DATE
week I-DATE
was O
always O
anticipated O
with O
quiet O
gladness O

were O
still O
more O
with O

serious O

free O

the O
exuberance O

might O
have O
thought O
the O
quiet O

usual O
life O
irksome O
indeed O
. O
| 
  | O
Edward B-PERSON
Fortescue I-PERSON
was O
looking O
forward O
with O
the O
greatest O
delight O
to O
becoming O
a O
midshipman O
in O
|
      | O
the O
course O
of O
the B-DATE
following I-DATE
year I-DATE
. O
He O
hoped O
, O
indeed O
, O
it O
would O
be O
in O
a B-DATE
very I-DATE
few I-DATE
months I-DATE
  O
but O
his O
|
      | O
uncle O
and O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
had O
only O
told O
him O
to O
work O
on O
as O
hard O
as O
he O
could O
, O
for O
the O
summons O
might O
|
      | O
come O
for O
him O
to O
join O
at O
a O
very O
short O
notice O
, O
and O
it O
would O
be O
very O
dreadful O
, O
if O
the O
commission O
|
      | O
should O
be O
refused O
because O
his O
guardians O
did O
not O
think O
him O
forward O
enough O
in O
his O
various O
|
      | O
studies O
to O
leave O
them O
. O
They O
had O
looked O
very O
mischievous O
when O
they O
had O
told O
him O
this O
, O
and O
|
      | O
Edward B-PERSON
had O
enjoyed O
the O
joke O
, O
and O
resolved O
they O
should O
not O
have O
any O
such O
amusement O
. O
He O
would O
go O
|
      | O
to O
sea O
, O
if O
he O
worked O
night O
and O
day O
for O
the O
privilege O
  O
and O
he O
really O
did O
so O
well O
, O
that O
his O
|
      | O
uncle O
gave O
him O
great O
praise O
, O
which O
was O
as O
unexpected O
and O
delightful O
as O
his O
anger O
was O
|
      | O
terrible O
. O
| 
  | O
It O
happened O
that O
on O
the B-TIME
morning I-TIME
after O
Christmas B-DATE
- I-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
Edward B-PERSON
and O
Ellen B-PERSON
were O
quite O
alone O
in O
|
      | O
the O
school O
room O
  O
the O
former O
was O
in O
one O
of O
his O
most O
impatient O
moods O
, O
for O
at O
his O
own O
request O
, O
|
      | O
his O
uncle O
was O
to O
examine O
him O
in O
a O
favorite O
study O
, O
and O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
necessary O
books O
was O
wanting O
. O
|
      | O
He O
had O
read O
it O
a O
few O
evenings O
previous O
, O
but O
something O
had O
crossed O
him O
, O
and O
in O
a O
desperate O
|
      | O
passion O
he O
had O
flung O
the O
book O
from O
him O
, O
and O
where O
it O
fell O
he O
neither O
knew O
nor O
cared O
. O
Caroline O
|
      | O
and O
Emmeline B-ORG
had O
already O
gone O
on O
an O
expedition O
to O
some O
poor O
people O
, O
with O
their O
mother O
  O
Ellen B-PERSON
|
      | O
had O
asked O
and O
received O
permission O
to O
put O
some O
seeds O
in O
her O
little O
garden O
, O
Percy B-PERSON
having O
kindly O
|
      | O
promised O
to O
show O
her O
where O
, O
and O
to O
do O
some O
harder O
work O
in O
it O
for O
her O
. O
He O
was O
, O
however O
, O
still O
|
      | O
engaged O
with O
his O
father O
, O
and O
would O
be O
, O
he O
had O
told O
her O
, O
for O
perhaps O
an B-TIME
hour I-TIME
longer O
, O
but O
he O
|
      | O
would O
be O
sure O
to O
come O
to O
her O
then O
  O
and O
, O
to O
employ O
the O
interval O
, O
she O
had O
intended O
to O
work O
hard O
|
      | O
at O
a O
purse O
she O
was O
making O
for O
him O
. O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
however O
, O
entirely O
engrossed O
her O
, O
and O
for O
nearly O
|
      | O
half B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour I-TIME
they O
hunted O
in O
every O
nook O
and O
corner O
of O
the O
room O
, O
at O
length O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
see O
it O
! O
I O
see O
it O
! O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
" O
Ellen B-PERSON
exclaimed O
, O
adding O
, O
however O
, O
in O
a O
very O
desponding O
tone O
, O
|
      | O
" O
but O
what O
shall O
we O
do O
? O
we O
can O
not O
get O
it O

" O
| 
  | O
" O
Why O
not O
? O
" O
answered O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
impatiently O
  O
" O
where O
is O
it O
, O
Ellen B-PERSON
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Behind O
that O
stand O
of O
flowers O
, O
" O
she O
replied O
, O
pointing O
to O
one O
that O
filled O
a O
corner O
of O
the O
|
      | O
room O
and O
which O
, O
though O
it O
was O
winter B-DATE
, O
was O
filled O
with O
some O
beautiful O
flowering O
geraniums O
of O

      | O
all O
colors O
, O
and O
some O
few O
rare O
myrtles O
in O
full O
flower O
. O

  | O
" O
There O
! O
" O
said O
Edward B-PERSON
joyfully O
  O
" O
Oh O
, O
that O
is O
very O
easily O
moved O

his O
sister O
to O

      | O
push O
back O
the O
stand O
. O
Ellen B-PERSON
felt O
almost O
sure O
she O
could O
not O
do O
it O
by O
herself O
  O
but O
how O
was O
she O
to O
|
      | O
act O
? O
To O
ask O
assistance O
would O
not O
only O
be O
confessing O
her O
own O
disobedience O
, O
but O
inculpating O
her O
|
      | O
brother O
, O
and O
really O
, O
perhaps O
, O
deprive O
him O
of O
the O
enjoyments O
he O
anticipated O
, O
and O
so O
confirm O
his O
|
      | O
unkind O
words O
. O
She O
tried O
to O
replace O
it O
, O
and O
thought O
she O
had O
quite O
succeeded O
  O
but O
as O
she O
moved O
|
      | O
it O
, O
one O
of O
the O
myrtles O
fell O
to O
the O
ground O
, O
and O
its O
beautiful O
blossom O
hung O
on O
the O
stalk O
, O
|
      | O
preserved O
from O
being O
quite O
broken O
off O
only O
by O
three B-CARDINAL
or O
four B-CARDINAL
delicate O
fibers O
. O
It O
was O
Caroline B-PERSON
's O
|
      | O
favorite O
plant O
  O
one O
she O
so O
cherished O
and O
tended O
, O
that O
Percy B-PERSON
called O
it O
her O
petted O
child O
  O
and O
|
      | O
poor O
Ellen B-PERSON
stood O
paralyzed O
  O
she O
raised O
the O
pot O
mechanically O
, O
and O
rested O
the O
broken O
head O
of O
the O
|
      | O
flower O
against O
the O
still O
uninjured O
sprig O
, O
and O
it O
looked O
so O
well O
and O
natural O
, O
that O
the O
thought O
|
      | O
for O
a O
moment O
darted O
across O
her O
mind O
that O
after O
all O
it O
might O
not O
be O
discovered O
. O
Then O
came O
all O
|
      | O
her O
aunt O
's O
lessons O
of O
the O
many O
ways O
of O
acting O
an O
untruth O
without O
words O
, O
and O
, O
therefore O
, O
even O
|
      | O
if O
it O
should O
not O
be O
discovered O
, O
it O
was O
no O
comfort O
  O
but O
could O
she O
, O
dared O
she O
, O
voluntarily O
|
      | O
confess O
what O
must O
appear O
a O
willful O
disobedience O
? O
If O
her O
aunt O
had O
been O
at O
home O
, O
she O
might O
in O
|
      | O
that O
first B-ORDINAL
moment O
have O
gained O
the O
necessary O
courage O
  O
but O
she O
was O
not O
expected O
back O
for O
two B-CARDINAL
or O
|
      | O
three B-TIME
hours I-TIME
, O
and O
Ellen B-PERSON
sat O
with O
her O
face O
buried O
in O
her O
hands O
, O
only O
conscious O
of O
misery O
, O
till O
|
      | O
her O
cousin O
's O
joyous O
voice O
called O
out O
from O
the O
hall O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
Come O
along O
, O
Nelly B-ORG
, O
I O
have O
kept O
you O
long O
enough O
  O
Tiny B-ORG
would O
never O
have O
left O
me O
quiet O
so O
|
      | O
long O
  O
but O
there O
is O
no O
tiring O
your O
patience O
. O
However O
, O
I O
will O
make O
up O
for O
it O
now O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
And O
glad O
to O
escape O
from O
her O
own O
thoughts O
, O
she O
hastily O
collected O
the O
various O
seeds O
, O
and O
ran O
|
      | O
after O
him O
. O
And O
Percy B-PERSON
was O
so O
active O
, O
so O
obliging O
, O
so O
amusing O
in O
his O
queer O
ways O
of O
working O
and O
|
      | O
talking O
, O
that O
she O
almost O
forgot O
the O
impending O
trial O
, O
till O
she O
met O
her O
aunt O
and O
cousins O
at O
|
      | O
luncheon O
. O
Edward B-PERSON
had O
been O
so O
intent O
, O
so O
happy O
at O
his O
business O
with O
his O
uncle O
, O
that O
he O
had O
|
      | O
never O
cast O
a O
thought O
as O
to O
how O
the O
stand O
got O
back O
  O
and O
after O
lunch O
he O
had O
to O
go O
for O
a O
row O
on O
|
      | O
the O
river O
, O
and O
after O
dinner O
to O
attend O
a O
lecture O
on O
astronomy O
, O
which O
, O
that B-TIME
night I-TIME
and O
the O
one O

      | O
following O
, O
was O
to O
be O
given O
in O
the O
town O
- O
hall O
in O
T—. B-GPE
His O
uncle O
and O
Percy B-PERSON
and O
Herbert B-PERSON
were O
to O
|
      | O
accompany O
him O
, O
and O
so O
, O
that O
he O
should O
give O
a O
thought O
to O
any O
thing O
disagreeable O
, O
was O
not O
|
      | O
likely O
. O
| 
  | O
The B-DATE
day I-DATE
wore O
on O
  O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
little O
courage O
had O
all O
gone O
, O
and O
she O
almost O
unconsciously O
hoped O
|
      | O
that O
nothing O
would O
be O
discovered O
. O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
and O
the O
lads O
departed O
at O
six B-CARDINAL
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
|
      | O
proposed O
adjourning O
to O
her O
daughters O
' O
room O
, O
to O
finish O
an O
entertaining O
book O
that O
they O
were O
|
      | O
reading O
aloud O
. O
She O
had O
noticed O
, O
with O
her O
usual O
penetration O
, O
that O
all O
day O
Ellen B-PERSON
evidently O
|
      | O
shrunk O
from O
her O
eye O
, O
and O
felt O
quite O
sure O
something O
was O
wrong O
again O
  O
but O
she O
asked O
no O
|
      | O
questions O
, O
fearing O
again O
to O
tempt O
equivocation O
. O
Caroline B-PERSON
's O
passionate O
exclamation O
that O
|
      | O
somebody O
had O
broken O
her O
beautiful O
flower O
, O
drew O
the O
attention O
of O
all O
to O
the O
stand O
, O
and O
one B-CARDINAL
|
      | O
glance O
sufficed O
to O
tell O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
that O
it O
had O
been O
moved O
. O
Her O
anxious O
suspicions O
at O
once O
|
      | O
connected O
this O
with O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
shrinking O
manner O
, O
and O
she O
turned O
to O
ask O
her O
if O
she O
knew O
any O
thing O
|
      | O
about O
it O
. O
But O
Ellen B-PERSON
had O
disappeared O
  O
and O
she O
rang O
the O
bell O
, O
and O
inquired O
of O
the O
only O
domestics O
|
      | O
whose O
department O
ever O
led O
them O
into O
the O
room O
, O
if O
they O
could O
explain O
the O
accident O
. O
But O
neither O
|
      | O
of O
them O
could O
  O
all O
uniting O
in O
declaring O
, O
that O
in O
the O
morning B-TIME
the O
myrtle O
was O
quite O
perfect O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Ellen B-PERSON
was O
at O
home O
, O
mamma O
  O
she O
must O
know O
something O
about O
it O
. O
Percy B-PERSON
said O
they O
did O
not O
begin O
|
      | O
gardening O
till O
more B-TIME
than I-TIME
an I-TIME
hour I-TIME
after O
we O
were O
gone O
, O
" O
exclaimed O
Caroline B-PERSON
, O
whose O
temper O
was O
|
      | O
sorely O
tried O
by O
this O
downfall O
of O
all O
her O
cares O
. O
" O
I O
dare O
say O
she O
did O
it O
herself O
— O
spiteful O
|
      | O
thing!—and O
has O
gone O
to O
hide O
herself O
rather O
than O
confess O
it O
— O
it O
is O
just O
like O
her O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Stop O
, O
Caroline B-PERSON
, O
do O
not O
condemn O
till O
you O
are O
quite O
certain O
  O
and O
do O
not O
in O
your O
anger O
say O
|
      | O
what O
is O
not O
true O
. O
Ellen B-PERSON
has O
given O
no O
evidence O
as O
yet O
of O
being O
spiteful O
or O
mischievous O
. O
|
      | O
Emmeline B-ORG
, O
go O
and O
tell O
your O
cousin O
that O
I O
want O
her O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
The O
child O
obeyed O
. O
Miss O
Harcourt B-PERSON
had O
continued O
working O
most O
industriously O
at O
the O
table O
, O
|
      | O
without O
uttering O
a O
word O
, O
though O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
's O
countenance O
expressed O
such O
unusual O
perplexity O
|
      | O
and O
pain O
, O
that O
it O
would O
have O
seemed O
kinder O
to O
have O
spoken O
. O
One B-CARDINAL
look O
at O
Ellen B-PERSON
convinced O
her O
|
      | O
aunt O
, O
and O
she O
actually O
paused O
before O
she O
spoke O
, O
dreading O
the O
reply O
almost O
as O
much O
as O
the O
child O
|
      | O
did O
the O
question O
. O
It O
was O
scarcely O
audible O
  O
it O
might O
have O
been O
denial O
, O
it O
certainly O
was O
not O
|
      | O
affirmative O
, O
for O
Miss O
Harcourt B-GPE
instantly O
exclaimed O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
how O
can O
you O
tell O
such O
a O
deliberate O
falsehood O
? O
I O
would O
not O
tell O
your O
aunt O
, O
for O
I O
|
      | O
really O
wished O
you O
to O
have O
the O
opportunity O
of O
in O
some O
degree O
redeeming O
your O
disobedience O
  O
but O
I O
|
      | O
saw O
you O
move O
back O
the O
stand O
, O
and O
your O
sinful O
attempt O
at O
concealment O
by O
replacing O
the O
broken O
|
      | O
flower O
— O
and O
now O
you O
dare O
deny O
it O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
did O
not O
replace O
the O
flower O
with O
the O
intention O
of O
concealing O
it O
, O
" O
exclaimed O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
|
      | O
bursting O
into O
tears O
  O
for O
that O
one O
unjust O
charge O
seemed O
to O
give O
back O
the O
power O
of O
speech O
, O
|
      | O
though O
the O
violent O
reproach O
and O
invective O
which O
burst O
from O
Caroline B-GPE
prevented O
any O
thing O

      | O
further O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
must O
beg O
you O

done O
speaking O

your O
cousin O

said O
her O
mother O
, O
quietly O
  O
" O
the O
fate O
of O
your O
flower O
seems O
to O
make O
you O
forget O
that O

I O
have O
never O

permitted O

my O
presence O

" O
But O
what O
right O
had O
Ellen B-PERSON
to O
touch O
the O
stand O

" O
| 
  | O
" O
None O

has O
both O
disobeyed O

again O
tried O
to O
deceive O
me O
  O
faults O

it O
is O
my O
duty O
to O

      | O
chastise O

not O
yours O

upbraid O

Answer O
me O
, O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
at O
once O
and O
briefly O
  O
your O
fault O
is O

      | O
known O
, O
and O
, O
therefore O
, O
all O
further O
equivocation O
is O
useless O

Did O
you O
move O
that O

flower O

stand O

" O

  | O
" O
Yes O

" O
replied O
the O
child O
, O
almost O
choked O
with O
sobs O
, O
called O
forth O
the O
more O
from O
the O
contrast O

      | O
which O
her O
aunt O

mildness O
presented O
to O
Miss O
Harcourt B-GPE

harshness O
, O
and O
Caroline B-PERSON
's O
violent O

      | O
anger O
, O
and O
from O
the O
painful O
longing O
to O
say O
that O
her O
first B-ORDINAL
disobedience O
was O
not O
entirely O
her O

you O

" O
Yes O

replied O
Ellen B-PERSON
again O

an O
exclamation O
at O
the O
apparent O
hardihood O
of O
her O
conduct O

escaped O
from O
both O

yet O
you O
persisted O

For O
full O
a O
minute O
Ellen B-PERSON
hesitated O
, O
thus O
unhappily O
confirming O
the O
suspicion O
that O
when O
she O
did O

      | O
reply O
it O
was O
another O
equivocation O

several B-TIME

Mrs. O

      | O
could O
sufficiently O
conquer O

her O
niece O

her O

gradually O

      | O
returned O

their O

Edward B-PERSON

grief O

the O
first B-ORDINAL

he O
had O
not O
sufficient O
boldness O
to O
say O
so O
. O
His O
aunt O
had O

      | O
expressly O
said O
it O
was O
the O
untruth O
that O
had O
occasioned O
her O
greatest O
displeasure O

that O
if O
the O

been O
confessed O
at O
once O

would O
, O
in O
consideration O

have O

      | O
forgiven O
it O

a O
very O
slight O
rebuke O

" O
Now O
, O

my O
acknowledging O

course O

wishes O
it O

I O
will O

could O
she O
tell O
such O
a O
deliberate O
story O

was O
acting O
one O

equal O
deliberation O

of O
far O
more O
culpability O
, O
if O
possible O
— O
for O

      | O
he O
was O
permitting O
her O
to O
bear O
the O
whole O
weight O
of O
his O
fault O
— O
never O
struck O
him O
  O
if O
it O
did O
, O
he O

      | O
did O
not O
at O
all O
understand O

believe O
it O
. O
He O
went O
to O
his O
sister O

offered O
to O
confess O
his O

      | O
share O
in O
her O
fault O

when O
— O
as O
he O
fully O
expected O

not O

that O

do O
her O
no O

good O

perhaps O
only O
get O
him O
punished O
too O
, O
his O
conscience O
was O
so O
perfectly O
satisfied O
, O
that O
|
      | O
he O
actually O
took O
upon O
himself O
to O
ask O
her O
how O
she O
could O
be O
so O
foolish O
and O
wrong O
as O
, O
when O
she O

      | O
was O
asked O
, O
not O
to O
allow O
that O

it O
at O
once O

" O
It O
would O
have O
been O
all O
right O

, O
" O
he O
said O
  O

added O
, O
almost O
with O
irritation O
, O
" O
and O
I O

      | O
should O
not O
have O
been O
teased O
with O
the O
thought O
of O
your O
being O
in O
disgrace O
just O
now O

I O
wanted O

so O
much O

myself O

about O

, O
Edward B-PERSON

" O

his O
sister O

know O
the O
untruth O

it O
torment O
you O

always O
tell O

act O
the O

      | O
truth O

not O
be O
so O
very O
, O
very O
frightened O

oh O
, O
how O
I O
wonder O
if O
I O
ever O
shall O
! O
" O
and O
she O
leaned O

      | O
her O
head O
on O
her O
arms O
, O
which O
rested O
on O
the O
table O

so O
despondingly O

so O
sorrowfully O
, O
that O
Edward B-PERSON

      | O
felt O
too O
uncomfortable O
to O
remain O
with O
her O
. O

was O
satisfied O
that O
he O
could O
not O
help O
her O
  O
but O
|
      | O
the O
disagreeable O
thought O
would O
come O
, O
that O
if O
he O
had O
not O
tempted O
her O
to O
disobey O
, O
she O
would O
have O
|
      | O
had O
no O
temptation O
to O
tell O
an O
untruth O
, O
and O
so O
he O
sought O
a O
variety O
of O
active O
amusements O
to O
get O
|
      | O
rid O
of O
the O
feeling O
. O
The O
continuation O
of O
the O
entertaining O
astronomical O
lecture O
, O
too O
, O
was O
so O

      | O
very O
delightful O
, O
and O
Thursday B-DATE
and O
Friday B-DATE
morning B-TIME
brought O
so O
many O
enjoyments O
, O
that O
he O
almost O

      | O
forgot O
her O
, O
till O
startled O
back O
into O
self O

by O
finding O
that O
she O

looked O
forward O

entreated O
, O
that O

might O
be O

permitted O
to O
go O

Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON

own O
kind O
heart O
pleaded O
quite O
as O
strongly O
, O

she O
remained O

      | O
firm O

" O
Do O
not O
ask O
me O
, O
my O
dear O
children O

she O
said O
, O
almost O
as O
beseechingly O
as O
they O
had O
implored O
  O
" O
I O

      | O
do O
assure O

quite O
as O

not O
more O
pain O

me O

this O
occasion O

for O
you O

third B-ORDINAL

Ellen B-PERSON

      | O
disregarded O

would O
yield O
for O
your O
sakes O

in O
the O
hope O

the O
indulgence O
would O

      | O
produce O
as O
good O

effect O

continued O
severity O

can O
not O
hope O

habit O

is O
, O
I O

      | O
fear O

so O
deeply O
rooted O

that O
nothing O

firmness O
in O
inflicting O
pain O
, O
whenever O
it O
is O

      | O
committed O

succeed O

eradicating O
it O

" O

The O
tone O

words O
were O
so O
earnest O
, O
so O
sad O

that O
not O
only O
did O
her O
children O
cease O
in O
their O

      | O
intercession O
, O

all O
felt O
still O
more O
forcibly O
the O
solemn O
importance O
of O
the O
virtue O
, O
in O
which O
|
      | O
Ellen B-PERSON
had O
so O
failed O
, O
from O
the O
effect O
of O
her O
conduct O
upon O
their O
mother O

She O
was O
always O
grieved O

had O
done O
wrong O

they O
never O

her O

very O
sad O
as O
now O
. O
Edward B-PERSON
, O

      | O
indeed O
, O
could O
scarcely O
understand O
this O
as O
his O
cousins O
did O
  O
but O
as O
his O
aunt O
still O
only O
alluded O
|
      | O
to O
the O
untruth O
, O
the O
qualm O
of O
conscience O
was O
again O
silenced O
, O
for O
he O
had O
only O
caused O
the O

      | O
disobedience O

Emmeline O
asked O
timidly O
if O

might O
remain O
with O

followed O
her O

|
      | O
such O
a O
happy O
evening B-TIME
! O
First B-ORDINAL
, O
there O
was O
the O
orrery O
, O
that O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
had O
prevailed O
on O
the O
|
      | O
lecturer O
to O
display O
first B-ORDINAL
at O
his O
house O
, O
and O
Edward B-PERSON
was O
almost O
wild O
in O
his O
delight O
  O
and O
then O
|
      | O
there O
were O
some O
games O
and O
intellectual O
puzzles O
, O
that O
made O
them O
all O
think O
, O
as O
well O
as O
enjoy O
  O
|
      | O
and O
then O
there O
were O
some O
music O
and O
singing O
and O
dancing O
, O
and O
every O
thing O
was O
so O
quiet O
and O
|
      | O
orderly O
, O
and O
yet O
so O
full O
of O
youthful O
enjoyment O
, O
that O
it O
was O
not O
much O
wonder O
there O
was O
no O
|
      | O
longer O
any O
room O
for O
a O
sorrowful O
thought O
, O
in O
any O
of O
the O
young O
party O
from O
Oakwood B-ORG
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
|
      | O
alone O
thought O
of O
Ellen B-GPE
, O
and O
again O
and O
again O
accused O
herself O
of O
too O
great O
harshness O
  O
for O
, O
|
      | O
perhaps O
, O
after O
all O
, O
it O
might O
have O
no O
better O
effect O
than O
kindness O
  O
but O
what O
could O
she O
do O
? O
She O
|
      | O
almost O
envied O
the O
quiet O
, O
unruffled O
unconcern O
of O
less O
anxious O
guardians O
  O
but O
for O
her O
to O
feel O
|
      | O
indifferent O
to O
her O
responsibility O
was O
impossible O
. O
Ellen B-PERSON
was O
so O
often O
unwell O
that O
her O
absence O
|
      | O
did O
not O
occasion O
so O
much O
remark O
as O
her O
brother O
's O
or O
either O
of O
her O
cousins O
' O
would O
. O
" O
Mamma O
did O
|
      | O
not O
wish O
her O
to O
come O
, O
" O
was O
the O
answer O
she O
had O
desired O
the O
children O
to O
give O
to O
any O
inquiries O
, O
|
      | O
and O
her O
character O
for O
indulgence O
was O
so O
generally O
known O
, O
that O
no O
one O
suspected O
any O
thing O
more O
|
      | O
than O
indisposition O
. O
Annie B-PERSON
Grahame I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
dislike O
to O
Ellen B-PERSON
might O
have O
made O
her O
more O
suspicious O
, O
but O
|
      | O
she O
was O
not O
there O
. O
Cecil O
and O
Lilla B-PERSON
were O
, O
with O
their O
father O
, O
but O
Miss B-PERSON

not O

condescend O

to O
herself O

both O

the O

The O
next O
night O

to O
Ellen B-PERSON

disposition O
, O
was O
a O
greater O
trial O
than O
the O

She O
neither O

expected O

      | O
Emmeline B-ORG
had O
come O
to O
wish O
her O
good O
night O

and O
with O
tears O
in O
her O
eyes O
repeated O
the O
regrets O
that O

      | O
she O
was O
not O
to O
go O
, O
she O
felt O
the O
bitter O
disappointment O
more O
than O
in O
the O
morning O
she O
had O
thought O

      | O
possible O
  O
but O
Saturday B-DATE

had O

from O

      | O
full O

the O
Saturday B-DATE
night B-TIME
, O
until O
they O
were O
fifteen B-CARDINAL
— O
old O
enough O
for O
her O
to O
relinquish O
it O
altogether O
. O
It O
|
      | O
had O
been O
such O
a O
habit O
with O
her O
own O
children O
, O
that O
they O
felt O
it O
perfectly O
natural O
  O
but O
with O

      | O
Ellen B-PRODUCT

Edward B-PERSON

from O
their O
never O
having O
been O
accustomed O

it O
as O
young O

herself O

Still O
, O
Ellen B-PERSON
looked O
forward O
to O
this B-TIME
night I-TIME
as O
the O
termination O
of O
her O
banishment O
  O
for O
great O

      | O
indeed O
was O
the O
offense O
whose O
correction O
extended O
over O
the O
Sabbath B-PERSON
. O
Ellen B-PERSON
could O
not O
remember O

      | O
one B-CARDINAL
instance O
since O
she O
had O
been O
at O
Oakwood B-ORG

and O
when O
she O
heard O
the O
doors O
of O
her O
cousins O

rooms O

      | O
successively O
close O
, O
and O
her O
aunt O

retreating O
without O
approaching O
hers O
, O
she O
did O
, O
indeed O
, O

      | O
believe O
herself O
irreclaimably O
wicked O
, O
or O
her O
kind O

good O
aunt O

would O
, O
at O

, O
have O
come O
to O

Mrs. O

purposely O
refrained O
from O
indulging O
her O
own O
inclinations O
, O
as O
well O
as O

      | O
comforting O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
hoping O
still O
more O
to O
impress O
upon O
her O
how O
greatly O
she O
had O
sinned O

The O

      | O
impossibility O

her O
perfectly O
comprehending O
her O

the O
poor O
child O
felt O

      | O
it O
such O
a O
sacred O
duty O
to O
victimize O
herself O
, O
made O
her O
far O
more O
severe O
than O
she O

it O

infinitely O

enter O
the O
ministry O
increased O
with O
his O
|
      | O
years O
, O
generally O
spent O
the O
greater O
part O
of O
Sunday B-DATE
with O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
, O
with O
his O
parents O
' O
glad O
and O
|
      | O
full O
consent O
. O
The O
contemplation O
of O
serious O
things O
was O
his O
greatest O
happiness O
, O
but O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
|
      | O
Hamilton B-PERSON
did O
not O
expect O
that O
all O
their O
other O
children O
were O
to O
be O
like O
him O
. O
They O
were O
|
      | O
contented O
, O
and O
intensely O
thankful O
also O
, O
to O
perceive O
that O
diverse O
as O
were O
their O
characters O
, O
|
      | O
still O
the O
constant O
sense O
of O
God O
's O
presence O
and O
of O
His O
infinite O
love O
was O
active O
and O
earnest O
in O
|
      | O
them O
all O
, O
inciting O
love O
and O
reverence O
for O
Herbert B-PERSON
, O
even O
though O
they O
could O
not O
sympathize O
with O
|
      | O
him O
entirely O
. O
Another O
peculiarity O
of O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
consisted O
in O
his O
permitting O
no O
|
        | O
Sunday B-DATE
|  | O
schools O
at O
Aveling O
and O
his O
other O
villages O
. O
The O
Saturday B-DATE
afternoons B-TIME
were O
set O
|
      | O
apart O
instead O
of O
the O
Sunday B-DATE
. O
He O
wished O
his O
wife O
, O
and O
daughters O
when O
they O
were O
old O
enough O
, O
to O
|
      | O
superintend O
them O
, O
and O
help O
the O
children O
in O
preparing O
for O
the O
Sunday B-DATE
services O
and O
Sunday B-DATE
|
      | O
enjoyments O
  O
but O
he O
particularly O
disliked O
the O
system O
of O
overwork O
on O
a B-DATE
day I-DATE
of O
rest O
, O
which O
could O
|
      | O
not O
fail O
to O
be O
the O
case O
, O
if O
there O
were O
schools O
to O
attend O
to O
twice O
or O
three B-CARDINAL
times O
a O
day O
, O
as O
|
      | O
well O
as O
church O
. O
| 
  | O
It O
being O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
day I-DATE
of O
the O
old O
year O
, O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
had O
expressed O
a O
wish O
that O
Percy B-PERSON
and O
Edward B-PERSON
|
      | O
as O
well O
as O
Herbert B-PERSON
should O
attend O
church O
that B-TIME
afternoon I-TIME
, O
and O
the O
lads O
, O
without O
the O
least O
|
      | O
reluctance O
, O
consented O
  O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
and O
Miss O
Harcourt B-PERSON
were O
going O
too O
, O
and O
Caroline B-GPE
and O
|
      | O
Emmeline B-ORG
, O
of O
their O
own O
accord O
, O
asked O
permission O
to O
accompany O
them O
. O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
pale O
, O
suffering O
|
      | O
face O
had O
so O
haunted O
her O
aunt O
, O
that O
she O
could O
not O
think O
of O
any O
thing O
else O
, O
and O
remained O
for O
a O
|
      | O
very O
much O
longer O
time O
than O
was O
usual O
to O
her O
character O
in O
a O
state O
of O
indecision O
. O
The B-TIME
next I-TIME
night I-TIME
|
      | O
was O
her O
children O
's O
ball O
, O
and O
it O
was O
too O
, O
the B-DATE
first I-DATE
day I-DATE
of O
the O
new O
year O
— O
always O
in O
her O
happy O
|
      | O
circle O
a O
festival O
of O
joy O
and O
thankfulness O
. O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
face O
certainly O
looked O
as O
if O
she O
had O
|
      | O
suffered O
quite O
enough O
to O
prevent O
the O
recurrence O
of O
her O
fault O
, O
but O
so O
it O
had O
always O
done O
, O
and O
|
      | O
yet O
, O
before O
she O
could O
possibly O
have O
forgotten O
its O
consequences O
, O
she O
failed O
again O
. O
Mrs. O
|
      | O
Hamilton B-PERSON
sat O
for O
some O
time O
, O
after O
her O
children O
had O
left O
her O
, O
in O
meditation O
, O
trying O
to O
silence O
|
      | O
the O
pleadings O
of O
affection O
, O
and O
listen O
only O
to O
reason O
, O
as O
to O
whether O
continued O
severity O
or O
|
      | O
returning O
kindness O
would O
be O
the O
more O
effective O
, O
and O
save O
both O
Ellen B-PERSON
and O
herself O
any O
further O
|
      | O
pain O
. O
| 
  | O
To O
the O
child O
herself O
physical O
suffering O
was O
so O
increasing O
as O
gradually O
to O
deaden O
mental O
, O
|
      | O
till O
at O
last O
it O
became O
so O
severe O
, O
that O
she O
felt O
sick O
and O
faint O
. O
She O
knew O
the O
medicine O
she O
was O
|
      | O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
taking O
when O
similarly O
suffering O
, O
and O
the O
lotion O
which O
her O
aunt O
applied O
to O
her O
|
      | O
forehead O
, O
and O
which O
always O
succeeded O
in O
removing O
the O
excessive O
throbbing O
, O
were O
both O
in O
Mrs. O
|
      | O
Hamilton B-PERSON
's O
dressing O
- O
room O
  O
but O
it O
seemed O
quite O
impossible O
that O
she O
could O
get O
at O
them O
, O
for O
she O
|
      | O
did O
not O
like O
to O
leave O
her O
room O
without O
permission O
, O
nor O
did O
she O
feel O
as O
if O
she O
could O
walk O
so O
|
      | O
far O
, O
her O
head O
throbbing O
with O
increased O
violence O
with O
every O
step O
she O
took O
. O
At O
length O
she O
|
      | O
summoned O
sufficient O
courage O
to O
ring O
the O
bell O
, O
and O
beg O
Fanny B-ORG
to O
ask O
Ellis B-PERSON
to O
come O
to O
her O
. O
The O
|
      | O
girl O
, O
who O
had O
been O
already O
dreadfully O
concerned O
that O
Miss O
Ellen B-PERSON
had O
eaten O
no O
dinner O
, O
and O
on O
|
      | O
Sunday B-DATE
too O
! O
gave O
such O
an O
account O
of O
her O
, O
that O
the O
housekeeper O
hastened O
to O
her O
directly O
, O
and O
|
      | O
begged O
her O
to O
let O
her O
go O
for O
her O
mistress O
— O
it O
was O
so O
lucky O
she O
had O
not O
gone O
to O
church O
— O
but O
Ellen B-PERSON
|
      | O
clung O
to O
her O
, O
imploring O
her O
not O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Dear B-WORK_OF_ART
, I-WORK_OF_ART
dear I-WORK_OF_ART
Ellis I-WORK_OF_ART
, O
get O
me O
the O
medicine O
, O
and O
bathe O
my O
forehead O
yourself O
  O
I O
shall O
get O
well O
|
      | O
then O
in O
an B-TIME
hour I-TIME
or O
two B-CARDINAL
, O
without O
giving O
my O
aunt O
any O
trouble O
  O
pray O
, O
pray O
, O
do O
n't O
tell O
her O
. O
I O
|
      | O
scarcely O
feel O
the O
pain O
when O
she O
is O
nursing O
and O
soothing O
me O
  O
but O
I O
do O
not O
deserve O
that O
now O
, O
and O
|
      | O
I O
am O
afraid O
I O
never O
shall O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
But O
indeed O
, O
Miss O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
she O
will O
be O
displeased O
if O
I O
do O
not O
. O
Why O
, O
only O
the O
other O
morning O
she O
|
      | O
was O
quite O
concerned O
that O
I O
had O
not O
told O
her O
Jane B-PERSON
was O
ill O
directly O
, O
and O
went O
herself O
two B-CARDINAL
or O
|
      | O
three B-CARDINAL
times O
every O
day O
to O
see O
she O
had O
every O
thing O
proper O
and O
comfortable O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
But O
that O
is O
quite O
different O
, O
dear O
Ellis B-PERSON
  O
do O
get O
the O
lotion O
  O
I O
feel O
as O
if O
I O
could O
not O
bear O
|
      | O
this O
pain O
much O
longer O
without O
crying O
  O
you O
can O
tell O
her O
afterward O
, O
if O
you O
think O
you O
ought O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
And O
seeing O
that O
farther O
argument O
only O
increased O
the O
poor O
child O
's O
sufferings O
, O
Ellis B-PERSON
promised O
, O
|
      | O
and O
left O
her O
. O
Ellen B-PERSON
leaned O
her O
forehead O
against O
the O
side O
of O
her O
little O
bed O
, O
and O
held O
the O
|
      | O
curtain O
tightly O
clasped O
, O
as O
if O
so O
to O
prevent O
the O
utterance O
of O
the O
hysteric O
sob O
that O
would O
rise O
|
      | O
in O
her O
throat O
, O
though O
she O
did O
not O
know O
what O
it O
was O
. O
But O
the O
wholly O
unexpected O
sound O
of O
Mrs. O
|
      | O
Hamilton B-PERSON
's O
voice O
saying O
, O
close O
by O
her O
, O
" O
I O
am O
afraid O
you O
have O
one O
of O
your O
very O
bad O
headaches O
, O
|
      | O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
" O
so O
startled O
her O
, O
as O
to O
make O
her O
raise O
her O
head O
suddenly O
  O
and O
the O
movement O
caused O
such O
|
      | O
agony O
, O
that O
, O
spite O
of O
all O
her O
efforts O
, O
she O
could O
not O
prevent O
an O
almost O
convulsive O
cry O
of O
|
      | O
pain O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
My O
dear O
child O
! O
I O
had O
no O
idea O
of O
pain O
like O
this O
  O
why O
did O
you O
not O
send O
for O
me O
? O
We O
have O
always O
|
      | O
prevented O
its O
becoming O
so O
very O
violent O
by O
taking O
it O
in O
time O
, O
my O
Ellen B-PRODUCT
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Miss O
Ellen B-PERSON
would O
not O
let O
me O
go O
for O
you O
, O
madam O
, O

rejoined O
Ellis B-PERSON
, O
who O
, O
to O
her O
mistress O
's O
|
      | O
inexpressible O
relief O
, O
was O
close O
at O
hand O
with O
the O
remedies O
she O
wanted O
, O
and O
she O
repeated O
what O
|
      | O
the O
child O
had O
said O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Again O
your O
old O
mistake O
, O
Ellen B-PERSON
. O
I O
would O
so O
much O
, O
so O
very O
much O
rather O
hear O
you O
say O
you O
were O
|
        | O
resolved O

to O
deserve O
my O
love O
, O
than O
that O
you O
did O
not O
merit O
it O
. O
Why O
should O
you O
not O
|
      | O
deserve O
it O
as O
well O
as O
your O
brother O
and O
cousins O
, O
if O
you O
determined O
with O
all O
your O
heart O
to O
try O

      | O
and O
not O
do O
any O
thing O
to O
lessen O
it O
? O
Nothing O
is O
so O
likely O
to O
prevent O
your O
even O
endeavoring O
to O

      | O
deserve O
it O
, O
as O
the O
mistaken O
fancy O
that O
you O
never O
shall O
  O
but O
you O
are O
too O
unwell O
to O
listen O
to O
me O
|
      | O
now O
  O
we O
must O
try O
all O
we O
can O
to O
remove O
this O
terrible O
pain O
, O
and O
then O
see O
if O
we O
can O
bring O
back O

      | O
happiness O
too O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
And O
for O
above B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour I-TIME
did O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
with O
the O
most O
patient O
tenderness O
, O
apply O
the O
usual O
|
      | O
remedies O
, O
cheered O
by O
finding O
that O
, O
though O
much O
more O
slowly O
than O
usual O
, O
still O
by O
degrees O
the O
|
      | O
violence O
of O
the O
pain O
did O
subside O
, O
and O
the O
hysterical O
affection O
give O
way O
to O
natural O
and O
quiet O
|
      | O
tears O
. O
Exhaustion O
produced O
a O
deep O
though O
not O
very O
long O
sleep O
, O
and O
after O
watching O
her O
some O
few O
|
      | O
minutes O
very O
anxiously O
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
sat O
down O
by O
her O
bed O
, O
and O
half B-CARDINAL
unconsciously O
drew O
toward O
|
      | O
her O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
little O
Bible B-WORK_OF_ART
, O
which O
lay O
open O
on O
the O
table O
, O
as O
if O
it O
had O
been O
only O
lately O
used O
. O
|
      | O
Several O
loose O
papers O
were O
between O
the O
leaves O
  O
her O
eyes O
filled O
with O
tears O
as O
she O
read O
on O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
|
      | O
them O
a O
little O
prayer O
, O
touching O
from O
the O
very O
childishness O
of O
the O
language O
and O
imperfect O

      | O
writing O
, O
beseeching O
her O
Father O
in O
Heaven O
in O
His O
great O
mercy O
to O
forgive O
her O
sin O
, O

give O
her O

      | O
courage O
to O
speak O
the O
truth O
, O
to O
help O
her O
not O
to O
be O
so O
frightened O
, O
but O
to O
guide O
her O
in O
her O

      | O
difficult O
path O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
little O
guessed O
how O
difficult O
it O
was O

but O
she O
hoped O
more O
from O
the O

      | O
effects O
of O
her O
present O
penitence O
than O
she O
had O
done O
yet O
. O
She O
had O
copied O
, O
too O
, O
several O
verses O

      | O
from O
the O
various O
parts O
of O
the O
Old O
and O
New B-ORG
Testament I-ORG
which O
were O
condemnatory O
of O
falsehood O
, O
and O
|
      | O
her O
aunt O
felt O
no O
longer O
undecided O
as O
to O
her O
course O
of O
action O
. O

  | O
" O
You O
have O
employed O
your O
solitary O
hours O
so O
well O
, O
my O
dear O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
" O
she O
said O
, O
as O
, O
when O
the O
child O
|
      | O
awoke O
and O
looked O
anxiously O
toward O
her O
— O
she O
kissed O
her O
cheek O
with O
even O
more O
than O
her O
usual O
|
      | O
fondness—"that O
I O
scarcely O
require O
your O
assurance O
of O
repentance O
or O
promises O
of O
amendment O
. O
When O

      | O
you O
have O
taken O
some O
coffee O
, O

think O
you O
are O
well O
enough O

listen O
to O
me O

I O
will O
read O
you O
an O

      | O
illustration O
of O
the O
fearful O
sin O
of O
falsehood O
from O
the B-ORG
Old I-ORG

which O
I O
do O
not O

pointed O
out O

I O
see O

remember O

" O

  | O
And O
when O
Ellen B-PERSON
had O
taken O
the O
delicious O
cup O
of O
coffee O
, O
which O
her O
aunt O
had O
ordered O
should O
be O
|
      | O
ready O
for O
her O
directly O
she O
awoke O
, O
and O
sat O
up O
, O
though O
her O
head O
was O
still O
so O
weak O
it O
required O
|
      | O
the O
support O
of O
a O
pillow O
, O
yet O
she O
seemed O
so O
revived O
, O
so O
almost O
happy O
, O
from O
the O
mesmeric O
effect O
|
      | O
of O
that O
warm O
, O
fond O
kiss O
, O
that O
her O
aunt O
did O
not O
hesitate O
to O
continue O
the O
lesson O
she O
was O
so O
|
      | O
anxious O
to O
impress O
, O
while O
the O
mind O
and O
heart O
were O
softened O
to O
receive O
it O
. O
She O
turned O
to O
the O

      | O
fourth B-ORDINAL
chapter O
of O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
book O
of O
Kings B-GPE
, O
and O
after O
briefly O
relating O
the O
story O
of O
Naaman B-PERSON
— O
for O

      | O
she O
did O
not O

one B-CARDINAL
important O

she O
read O
from O
the O
20th B-ORDINAL
verse O
to O
the O
end O
, O
and O
so O
brought O
the O
nature O
of O
Gehazi B-PERSON

sin O

      | O
its O
awful O
punishment O

to O

      | O
Ellen B-PERSON

mind O
, O
that O
she O
never O

it O

" O
Do O
you O
think O
Elisha B-PERSON
knew O
where O
he O

what O
he O
had O
done O
, O
before O

asked O
him O
? O
" O
she O

      | O
ventured O
timidly O
to O
inquire O
, O
as O
her O
aunt O
ceased O
  O
" O
Gehazi B-PERSON
had O
told O
a O
falsehood O
already O
to O

Naaman B-PERSON

Do O
you O

God O
punished O
that O

his O
falsehood O
to O
Elisha B-PERSON
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Most O
probably O
he O
punished O
both O
, O
my O
love O

Elisha B-PERSON
no O

knew O
how O

employed O
in O
his O
absence O
, O
in O
fact O

tells O
him O
so"—and O
she O
read O
the O
26th B-ORDINAL
verse O
again—"but O
he O
|
      | O
asked O
him O
whence O
he O

come O
, O

give O
him O
an O
opportunity O

a O
full O
confession O

It O
was O
a O
very O

      | O
great O
fault O
at O

the O
mercy O

it O
is O

infinite O

forgiving O

excited O
real O

      | O
repentance O

averted O

But O
his O
aggravated O

repeated O
falsehood O

called O
down O
on O
him O
a O
chastisement O
most O
terrible O
even O
to O
think O
about O
. O
Leprosy O
was O
not O
merely O
a O

      | O
dreadful O
disease O
in O
itself O
, O

it O
cut O
him O
off O

from O
all O
the O
blessings O

joys O
not O
only O
of O

      | O
social O
life O

of O
domestic O
  O

said O
it O
should O
cleave O
to O
his O
seed O
as O
well O

      | O

could O
never O
find O
any O

love O
him O

lonely O
misery O
all O
his O
life O

" O

" O
It O
was O
a O
very O
dreadful O
punishment O

repeated O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
fearfully O
. O

permitted O

without O
any O

      | O
recall O
him O

banished O

would O
not O

have O
been O
still O
more O
dreadful O
than O

      | O
the O
heaviest O
suffering O
here O
? O
In O
those O
times O
God O
manifested O
his O
judgments O
through O
His O
prophets O

      | O
directly O
. O
That O
is O
not O
the O
case O
now O

He O
has O
given O
us O
His O
word O
to O
tell O
us O
, O
by O
history O
as O

      | O
well O
as O
precept O
, O
those O
things O
that O
are O
pleasing O
to O
Him O

those O
which O
excite O
His O
anger O
  O

which O
, O
if O
not O
corrected O

we O

cause O

      | O
if O

God O

He O

tells O

very O
sadly O

added O

the O

Their O
own O
idea O
of O

      | O
family O
ties O
was O
so O
strong O
and O
so O
holy O
, O
that O
one O
great O
aim O
in O
the O
education O
of O
their O
children O

      | O
was O
to O

Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
had O
known O
many O
young O
persons O
who O
were O
lavish O
in O
attentions O
and O
|
      | O
even O
presents O
to O
friends O
, O
but O
never O
imagined O
that O
their O
own O
home O
circle O
had O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
and O
|
      | O
strongest O
claim O
to O
kindness O
, O
whether O
of O
word O
or O
deed O
. O
She O
knew O
that O
affections O
and O
thought O
|
      | O
lavished O
on O
comparative O
strangers O
never O
radiated O
on O
home O
, O
but O
that O
when O
given O
to O
home O
|
        | O
first B-ORDINAL
| | O
, O
they O
shed O
light O
and O
kindliness O
far O
and O
near O
. O
| 
  | O
Their O
tea O
was O
indeed O
a O
mirthful O
one O
  O
Ellen B-PERSON
had O
been O
very O
fearful O
of O
meeting O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
, O
for O
|
      | O
she O
thought O
he O
must O
have O
been O
told O
how O
naughty O
she O
had O
been O
  O
but O
if O
he O
had O
, O
there O
was O
nothing O
|
      | O
in O
his O
manner O
to O
say O
so O
  O
for O
he O
shook O
hands O
with O
her O
, O
and O
even O
kissed O
her O
most O
kindly O
, O
and O
|
      | O
told O
her O
, O
laughingly O
, O
that O
she O
must O
be O
quite O
well O
by O
the B-TIME
next I-TIME
night I-TIME
, O
or O
how O
was O
she O
to O
dance O
? O
|
      | O
That O
he O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
a O
good O
thing O
if O
Emmeline B-PERSON
could O
give O
her O
a O
little O
of O
her O
dancing O
|
      | O
mania O
, O
as O
she O
hardly O
ever O
only O
walked O
, O
even O
when O
she O
called O
herself O
quite O
sober O
. O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
every O

      | O

thought O
of O

his O
sister O

was O
in O
the O
wildest O
|
      | O
spirits O
  O
Percy B-PERSON
and O
Emmeline O
seemed O
to O
have O
laid O
a O
wager O
who O
could O
say O
the O
wittiest O
things O
and O
|
      | O
laugh O
the O
most O
. O
Herbert B-PERSON
was O
very O
quiet O
, O
but O
looking O
as O
happy O
as O
the O
rest O
, O
and O
quite O
entering O
|
      | O
into O
their O
mirth O
, O
and O
showing O
all O
sorts O
of O
little O
gentle O
attentions O
to O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
seemed O

      | O
to O
shrink O
from O
his O
eye O
, O
more O
than O
from O
all O
the O
others O
. O
Caroline B-PERSON
fully O
entered O
into O
the O
spirit O
|
      | O
of O
the O
evening O
, O
but O
neither O
she O
nor O
Miss O
Harcourt B-PERSON
took O
the O
same O
notice O
of O
Ellen B-PERSON
as O
the O
rest O

The O

by O

the O
various O

      | O
treasures O
from O

, O
and O
carry O
them O
to O
the O
owners O
whose O
names O
they O
bore O
, O
was O
always O
chosen O
|
      | O
by O
lot O
  O
and O
great O
was O
the O
delight O
of O
the O
young O
party O
, O
when O
this B-TIME
night I-TIME
the O
office O
fell O
on O
Mr. O

      | O
Howard B-PERSON
. O
No O
one O
seemed O
more O
pleased O
than O
himself O
, O
performing O
it O
with O
such O
a O
spirit O
of O
enjoyment O
|
      | O
and O
originality O
, O
that O
a O
general O
vote O
declared O
him O
the O
very O
choicest O
wizard O
they O
had O
ever O
had O
. O
|
      | O
To O
enumerate O
all O
the O
contents O
of O
that O
marvelous O
tree O
would O
be O
impossible O
. O
Their O
parents O

each O
of O

were O
not O
in O
the O
tree O
, O
but O
always O
given O
afterward O
  O
but O
great O
was O
the O
delight O
, O
|
      | O
when O
, O
after O
a O
terrible O
tussle O
to O
detach O
a O
large O
roll O
of O
cloth O
, O
down O
it O
came O
, O
right O
on O
Mr. O

      | O
Howard B-PERSON
's O
head O
, O
and O
almost O
enveloped O
him O
with O
its O
folds O
, O
and O
proved O
to O
be O
a O
beautiful O
cover O
, O
|
      | O
which O
he O
had O
long O
desired O
for O
a O
favorite O
table O
in O
his O
drawing O
- O
room O
at O
the O
embroidered O
border O

      | O
of O
which O
, O
not O
only O
the O
three B-CARDINAL
girls O
, O
but O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
and O
Miss O
Harcourt B-PERSON
had O
all O
worked O
, O
as O
a O
|
      | O
joint O
offering O
of O
love O
and O
respect O
. O
This O
good O
man O
was O
so O
charmed O
, O
that O
he O
declared O
he O
would O
|
      | O
not O
use O
his O
wand O
again O
till O
he O
had O
full O
five B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
to O
admire O
it O
. O
Then O
there O
was O
a O
very O

      | O
pretty O
, O
comfortable O
pair O
of O

worked O

and O
a O

      | O
pair O
of O
braces O
worked O
by O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
all O
accompanied O
by O
some O
most O
ludicrous O
, O
but O
very O
clever O
verses O
|
      | O
from O
Percy B-PERSON
. O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
very O
ingenious O
, O
had O
turned O
a O
very O
pretty O
stand O
for O
his O
uncle O
to O

      | O
put O
his O
watch O
in O
at O
night B-TIME
  O
and O
manufactured O
two B-CARDINAL
little O
vessels O
out O
of O
cork O
for O
his O
aunt O
, O
so O
|
      | O
delicately O
, O
and O
neatly O
, O
that O
she O
promised O
him O
they O
should O
stand O
on O
the O
mantelpiece O
of O
her O

      | O
dressing O

room O
, O
as O
long O
as O
they O
would O
last O

Caroline B-PERSON
had O
knitted O
her O
mother O
a O
very O
pretty O
bag O
, O
|
      | O
and O
Emmeline B-PRODUCT

Ellen B-PERSON
had O
collected O
for O
her O
a O
variety O
of O
leaves O
throughout O
the B-DATE
year I-DATE
, O
and O
|
      | O
arranged O
them O
with O
great O
taste O
, O
both O
as O
to O
grouping O
and O
tinting O
, O
in O
a O
sort O
of O
small O
herbal O

      | O
with O
two B-CARDINAL

three B-CARDINAL
lines O

selected O

carefully O
written O
by O
each O
alternately O
, O

      | O
attached O
to O
each O

. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
was O
excessively O
pleased O
, O
as O
she O
was O
also O
with O
a O
portfolio O

      | O
formed O
by O
drawings O
from O
both O
her O
boys O
, O

tastefully O
made O
up O
by O
Miss O

  O
and O
with O
their O
|
      | O
gifts O
to O
their O
father O
, O
a O
correct O
and O
most O
beautifully O
written O
out O
Greek B-NORP
poem O
, O
which O
Mr. O
|
      | O
Hamilton B-PERSON
had O
several B-DATE
months I-DATE
, O
if O
not O
more B-DATE
than I-DATE
a I-DATE
year I-DATE
before O
, O
expressed O
a O
wish O
to O
possess O
, O
but O
|
      | O
the O
volume O
which O
contained O
it O
was O
so O
scarce O
, O
and O
so O
expensive O
from O
the O
quantity O
of O
|
      | O
uninteresting O
matter O
in O
which O
the O
gem O
was O
buried O
, O
that O
he O
had O
given O
up O
all O
thought O
of O
it O
. O
|
      | O
Herbert B-PERSON
, O
however O
, O
had O
not O
, O
and O
never O
rested O
from O
the O
time O
his O
father O
spoke O
, O
till O
he O
had O
found O
|
      | O
and O
copied O
it O
— O
a O
task O
of O
no O
small O
difficulty O
, O
for O
the O
original O
was O
in O
many O
parts O
almost O
|
      | O
entirely O
effaced O
, O
and O
, O
if O
Herbert B-PERSON
had O
not O
been O
an O
admirable O
Greek B-NORP
scholar O
, O
and O
a O
quick O

      | O
imaginator O
as O
to O
what O
it O
ought O
to O
be O
, O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
himself O
had O
said O
he O
could O
not O
have O
succeeded O
. O
|
      | O
The O
writing O
of O
the O
Greek B-NORP
character O
was O
most O
beautiful O
, O
and O
Percy B-PERSON
, O
in O
imitation O
of O
the O
ancient O

      | O
missals O

designed O

painted O
an O
elegant O

a O
beautiful O

      | O
cover O
, O
forming O
a O
thin O
volume O
, O
so O
valuable O
, O
their O
father O
delighted O
them O
by O
saying O
, O
that O
he O
|
      | O
would O
not O
exchange O
it O
for O
twenty B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
most O
precious O
volumes O
in O
his O
library O
. O
Such O
evidences O

      | O
of O
the O
home O
influence O
they O
had O
given O

thence O
allowing O
them O
to O
enhance O
the O

were O
indeed O

      | O
most O
gratifying O
to O
those O

affectionate O
guardians O

From O

almost O
in O

very O
sorry O

among O

this B-TIME
evening I-TIME

I O
really O

earnestly O

continued O
much O
more O

worked O
myself O

almost O

when O
in O

recognized O
something O

had O
been O

with O
the O
recollection O
of O

Mr. O

that O
it O
was O

much O
too O
good O
for O

looking O
so O
mischievous O
, O
Edward B-PERSON

quite O
charmed O

      | O
wondered O

could O
" O
exist O

without O

As O
Mr. O

found O
that O

could O
not O

only O

" O
exist O

" O

much O
as O
she O
admired O

had O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
so O
coveted O
it O

as O
to O
have O
a O

hard O
battle O

pleasure O

they O
indulged O
themselves O

their O

      | O
child O
, O
and O
were O
more O
than O
repaid O
by O
the O
beaming O
look O
of O
delight O
with O
which O
it O
was O
received O

it O

in O

Mrs. O

quite O
comfortable O

      | O
that O
there O
was O
no O
return O
of O
pain O

and O
she O
was O
almost O
startled O
, O
and O
certainly O
still O
more O
|
      | O
bewildered O
as O
to O
how O
such O
a O
depth O
of O
feeling O
could O
exist O
with O
such O
a O
real O
childish O
liability O
|
      | O
to O
error O
, O
and O
why O
it O
should O
be O
so O
carefully O
concealed O
, O
by O
the O
way O
in O
which O
Ellen B-PERSON
clung I-PERSON
to O
her O
, O
|
      | O
as O
she O
bent O
over O
her O
to O
wish O
her O
good O
night O
, O
with O
the O
same O
unrestrained O
affection O
as O
her O
own O
|
      | O
Emmeline B-PRODUCT
did O
so O
often O
, O
with O
the O
only O
difference O
, O
that O
with O
the O
latter O
it O
seemed O
always O
to O
|
      | O
spring B-DATE
from O
the O
very O
exuberance O
of O
happiness O
, O
which O
could O
only O
be O
thus O
displayed O
. O
With O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
|
      | O
this B-TIME
night I-TIME
, O
it O
appeared O
like O
some O
deep O
, O
quiet O
feeling O
, O
almost O
of O
devotion O
, O
and O
as O
if O
— O
though O
|
      | O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
's O
sober O
reason O
tried O
to O
persuade O
her O
imagination O
that O
it O
was O
too O
much O
meaning O
to O
|
      | O
attach O
to O
a O
mere O
embrace O
— O
she O
would O
thus O
tell O
her O
how O
intensely O
she O
felt O
, O
not O
only O
the O
|
      | O
indulgence O
of O
that O
evening O
, O
but O
the O
true O
kindness O
and O
watchful O
love O
which O
had O
caused O
the O
|
      | O
preceding O
sorrow O
. O
She O
might O
have O
thought O
, O
as O
no O
doubt O
many O
of O
our O
readers O
will O
, O
that O
Ellen B-PERSON
was O
|
      | O
much O
too O
young O
and O
too O
childish O
, O
to O
contrast O
her O
system O
of O
treatment O
with O
her O
poor O
mother O
's O
  O
|
      | O
that O
she O
felt O
her O
soothing O
care O
in O
her B-TIME
hours I-TIME
of O
physical O
suffering O
— O
her O
indulgent O
love O
making O
|
      | O
no O
distinction O
between O
her O
and O
her O
cousins O
— O
still O
the O
more O
keenly O
and O
gratefully O
, O
from O
the O
|
      | O
recollection O
of O
her O
own O
mother O
's O
constant O
preference O
of O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
and O
utter O
neglect O
of O
her O
  O
and O
|
      | O
that O
this O
contrast O
so O
deepened O
the O
love O
she O
bore O
her O
aunt O
, O
that O
it O
exceeded O
in O
intensity O
even O

      | O
that O
borne O
toward O
her O
by O
her O
own O
children.—Adults O
will O
think O
this O
all O
very O
fanciful O
, O
and O
|
      | O
perhaps O
interesting O
, O
but O
wholly O
improbable O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
herself O
would O
have O
banished O
the O

      | O
idea O

imaginary O

be O
entertained O
seriously O

any O
guide O

Ellen B-PERSON
herself O
could O
not O

explained O

told O
herself O
that O
so O
she O
felt O
  O
and O
yet O
, O

notwithstanding O

all O

in O
conducting O

such O
inimitable O
grace O

often O
in O
secret O
longed O
|
      | O
painfully O
for O
admiration O
and O
homage O
  O
and O
child O
as O
she O
still O
was O
in O
years B-DATE
, O
yet O
at O
her O
own O
|
      | O
house O
, O
and O
as O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
's O
eldest O
daughter O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
her O
real O
attractions O
, O
she O
always O
|
      | O
received O
both O
in O
sufficient O
measure O
, O
as O
to O
satisfy O
even O
herself O
. O
She O
delighted O
in O
those O
|
      | O
evenings O
when O
it O
so O
chanced O
that O
her O
brothers O
had O
young O
friends O
with O
them O
, O
making O
no O
|
      | O
hesitation O
in O
confessing O
that O
she O
very O
much O
preferred O
conversing O
with O
boys O
than O
with O
girls O
, O
|
      | O
there O
was O
so O
much O
more O
variety O
, O
more O
spirit O
  O
and O
though O
her O
mother O
's O
heart O
would O
actually O
|
      | O
tremble O
at O
the O
fearful O
ordeal O
which O
an O
introduction O
to O
the O
pleasures O
of O
the O
world O
would O
be O
to O
|
      | O
such O
a O
character O
, O
still O
she O
would O
not O
check O
the O
open O
expression O
of O
such O
sentiments O
by O
|
      | O
reproving O
them O
as O
wrong O
, O
and O
not O
to O
be O
encouraged O
. O
She O
knew O
that O
though O
education O
might O
do O
|
      | O
much O
, O
very O
much O
, O
it O
could O
not O
make O
natural O
characters O
all O
alike O
  O
nor O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
did O
she O
wish O
|
      | O
it O
. O
She O
did O
not O
grieve O
and O
complain O
that O
, O
with O
all O
her O
efforts O
she O
could O
not O
make O
Caroline B-PERSON
|
      | O
give O
her O
as O
little O
trouble O
and O
anxiety O
as O
Emmeline B-ORG
, O
nor O
did O
she O
imagine O
that O
she O
should O
see O
|
      | O
the O
effect O
of O
her O
earnest O
prayers O
and O
cares O
all O
at O
once O
, O
or O
without O
constant O
relapses O
in O
the O
|
      | O
cherished O
object O
of O
her O
care O
. O
She O
did O
all O
she O
could O
to O
counteract O
a O
tendency O
which O
, O
situated O
|
      | O
as O
she O
would O
be O
when O
she O
entered O
life O
, O
must O
, O
without O
some O
strong O
, O
high O
principle O
, O
lead O
to O
|
      | O
suffering O
, O
and O
, O
perhaps O
, O
to O
sin O
— O
for O
what O
is O
coquetry O
? O
But O
she O
indulged O
in O
no O
idea O
of O
security O
, O
|
      | O
never O
believed O
that O
because O
she O
had O
so O
tried O
, O
so O
striven O
to O
sow O
the O
good O
seed O
, O
it O
could O
not O
|
      | O
fail O
to O
bring O
forth O
good O
fruit O
. O
She O
knew O
many O
trials O
might O
be O
in O
store O
for O
her O
  O
for O
how O
might O
|
      | O
she O
hope O
to O
pass O
through O
life O
blessed O
as O
she O
was O
then O
? O
It O
might O
please O
her O
Father O
in O
Heaven O
to O
|
      | O
try O
her O
faith O
and O
duty O
through O
those O
she O
loved O
so O
intensely O
  O
but O
if O
she O
failed O
not O
in O
her O
|
      | O
task O
, O
he O
would O
bring O
her O
joy O
at O
last O
. O
| 
  | O
To O
Emmeline O
the O
idea O
of O
dancing O
was O
quite O
enough O
to O
be O
the O
acme O
of O
enjoyment O
. O
The O
only O
|
      | O
drawback O
was O
, O
that O
in O
the O
intervals O
of O
rest O
, O
there O
was O
to O
be O
a O
little O
music O
, O
and O
though O
her O
|
      | O
mother O
had O
excused O
her O
at O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
's O
, O
she O
knew O
that O
if O
anybody O
expressed O
a O
wish O
to O
hear O
her O
|
      | O
at O
her O
own O
house O
, O
play O
she O
must O
  O
and O
at O
those O
times O
she O
was O
half B-CARDINAL
sorry O
she O
had O
chosen O
to O
learn O
|
      | O
the O
harp O
instead O
of O
the O
piano O
, O
as O
Caroline B-GPE
played O
so O
well O
on O
the O
latter O
instrument O
nobody O
|
      | O
would O
care O
to O
hear O
her O
  O
but O
the O
harp O
was O
rather O
a O
novelty O
, O
and O
no O
little O
girl O
who O
was O
coming O
|
      | O
played O
it O
, O
and O
so O
she O
was O
sadly O
afraid O
there O
was O
no O
escape O
for O
her O
, O
and O
that O
was O
very O
|
      | O
disagreeable O
, O
but O
she O
would O
not O
think O
about O
it O
till O
the O
time O
came O
  O
the O
dancing O
to O
such O
music O
|
      | O
as O
that O
which O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
had O
ordered O
from O
Plymouth B-PERSON
was O
joy O
enough O
. O
| 
  | O
Ellen B-PERSON
though O
rather O
afraid O
of O
so O
many O
strangers O
, O
could O
not O
resist O
the O
general O
contagion O
of O
|
      | O
anticipated O
enjoyment O
. O
She O
did O
not O
indeed O
wake O
with O
the O
thought O
of O
the O
ball O
, O
but O
with O
the O
|
      | O
determination O
to O
learn O
the O
verse O
of O
the O
Psalm B-GPE
her O
aunt O
had O
pointed O
out O
, O
and O
go O
and O
say O
it O
to O
|
      | O
her O
in O
her O
dressing O
- O
room O
before O
she O
went O
down O
. O
And O
as O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
verse O
was O
very O
short O
she O
|
      | O
learned O
two B-CARDINAL
, O
and O
repeated O
them O
without O
missing O
a O
word O
, O
and O
so O
as O
if O
she O
quite O
understood O
them O
, O
|
      | O
that O
her O
aunt O
was O
very O
much O
pleased O
  O
and O
then O
Ellen B-PERSON
could O
think O
of O
and O
join O
her O
brother O
's O
and O
|
      | O
cousins O
' O
delight O
, O
even O
though O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
was O
obliged O
to O
be O
what O
she O
called O
very O
cruel O
, O
but O
|
      | O
what O
Ellen B-PERSON
knew O
was O
very O
kind O
, O
though O
it O
did O
seem O
a O
restraint O
, O
and O
keep O
her O
very O
quiet O
all O
|
      | O
day O
, O
instead O
of O
letting O
her O
run O
about O
from O
room O
to O
room O
, O
as O
Emmeline B-PRODUCT
and O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
and O
even O
|
      | O
Percy B-PERSON
did O
, O
for O
fear O
of O
another O
headache O
  O
and O
so O
well O
did O
quietness O
succeed O
, O
that O
she O
looked O
|
      | O
and O
was O
unusually O
well O
, O
and O
so O
was O
almost O
lively O
by O
the O
evening B-TIME
. O
| 
  | O
Just O
before O
dinner O
, O
Percy B-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
gone O
to O
ride O
, O
because O
he O
said O
he O
was O
sure O
he O
should O
get O
|
      | O
into O
some O
scrape O
if O
he O
did O
not O
give O
a O
natural O
vent O
to O
his O
spirits O
, O
galloped O
back O
in O
company O
|
      | O
with O
a O
gentleman O
, O
whose O
presence O
seemed O
to O
occasion O
him O
still O
greater O
excitement O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Where O
is O
my O
mother O
? O
and O
is O
my O
father O
at O
home O
? O
" O
he O
asked O
impatiently O
, O
flinging O
his O
horse O
's O
|
      | O
rein O
to O
Robert B-PERSON
, O
desiring O
him O
to O
take O
every O
care O
of O
the O
gentleman O
's O
horse O
, O
as O
he O
should O
not O
let O
|
      | O
him O
leave O
Oakwood B-ORG
that O
night O
  O
and O
rushing O
across O
the O
hall O
threw O
open O
the O
door O
of O
their O
common O
|
      | O
sitting O
- O
room O
, O
and O
exclaimed O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
Mother O
, O
give O
me O
a O
vote O
of O
thanks O
and O
praise O
for O
my O
invincible O
eloquence!—Here O
is O
this O
|
      | O
anchorite O
, O
this O
monk O
of O
the O
moor O
, O
who O
, O
when O
I O
first B-ORDINAL
encountered O
him O
, O
seemed O
so O
doughty O
a O
|
      | O
denier O
of O
my O
wishes O
, O
actually O
conquered O
— O
led O
a O
slave O
to O
your O
feet O
  O
reward O
me O
by O
throwing O
all O
|
      | O
the O
fascinations O
you O
possibly O
can O
in O
his O
way O
, O
that O
he O
may O
only O
dream O
of O
his O
cold O
ride O
and O
|
      | O
desolate O
cottage O
on O
Dartmoor B-ORG
to O
- O
night O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Be O
quiet O
, O
madcap O
! O
" O
replied O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
rising O
with O
very O
evident O
pleasure O
, O
and O
coming O
|
      | O
forward O
with O
extended O
hand O
  O
" O
your O
noisy O
welcome O
will O
not O
permit O
mine O
to O
be O
heard O
. O
This O
is O
|
      | O
indeed O
, O
a O
pleasure O
, O
Mr. O
Morton B-PERSON
, O
" O
she O
added O
, O
addressing O
the O
young O
clergyman O
with O
that O
earnest O
|
      | O
kindness O
, O
which O
always O
goes O
to O
the O
heart O
, O
" O
and O
one O
that O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
will O
most O
highly O
|
      | O
appreciate O
— O
if O
, O
as O
I O
trust O
, O
the O
chains O
my O
son O
has O
thrown O
over O
you O

not O
so O
heavy O
as O
to O

      | O
become O
painful O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
should O
rather O
fear O
the O
pain O
will O
be O
in O
casting O
them O
off O
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
not O
in O
the O
|
      | O
wearing O
them O
, O
" O
replied O
Mr. O
Morton B-PERSON
, O
almost O
sadly O
  O
" O
it O
is O
the O
knowledge O
, O
that O
mingling O
as O
often O

      | O
in O
your O
home O

as O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON

my O
friend O
Percy B-PERSON

, O
would O
wholly O
unfit O
me O
for O
the O

      | O
endurance O
of O
my O
loneliness O
, O
that O
keeps O
me O
so O
aloof O

me O

Inclination O
would O
act O
a O
very O

      | O
different O
part O
, O
but O
there O
was O
no O
resisting O
such O
eloquence O

such O
happiness O
as O
his O
to O
- O
day O

" O
|
      | O
he O
continued O
, O
more O
gayly O
. O
| 
  | O
And O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
and O
Herbert B-PERSON
entering O
as O
he O
spoke O
, O
their O
greeting O
was O
quite O
as O
warm O
and O
|
      | O
eager O
as O
Percy B-PERSON
's O
and O
his O
mother O
's O
, O
and O
Mr. O
Morton B-PERSON
gave O
himself O
up O
, O
for O
the O
evening O
at O
least O
, O
|
      | O
to O
enjoyment O
. O
His O
own O
generous O
nature O
had O
been O
particularly O
struck O
by O
Percy B-PERSON
's O
manly O
conduct O

      | O
with O
regard O
to O
his O
satire O

their O
characters O

a O
warm O
friendship O
from O
that O

      | O
moment O
commenced O
between O
them O

It O
was O
impossible O
to O
resist O
Percy B-PERSON
's O
warm O
- O
heartedness O
of O
word O

      | O
and O
deed O
  O
and O
that O
he O
would O
sometimes O
leave O
his O

stay O
two B-DATE

three I-DATE
days I-DATE

with O

seeming O

to O
enjoy O
the O
rude O
cottage O

its O
desolate O
localities O

      | O
spread O
such O
a O
spirit O
of O
mirth O
within O

around O

that O
it O
was O
no O
wonder O
the O
afflicted O
young O
man O

      | O
looked O
to O
his O
society O
as O
almost O
his O
greatest O
pleasure O

as O
he O
felt O

not O
too O

      | O
often O
accept O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON

Oakwood O

himself O

the O
struggle O

more O

the B-TIME

even O
the O
respective O
toilets O
completed O
, O
|
      | O
Percy B-PERSON
and O
Emmeline O
found O
it O
impossible O
to O
resist O
trying O
the B-DATE
spring I-DATE
, O
as O
they O
called O
it O
, O
of O
the O

      | O
oaken O
floors O
( O
whence O
the O
carpets O
had O
been O
removed O
) O
, O
and O
amused O
themselves O
by O
waltzing O
in O
the O

      | O
largest O
circle O
they O
could O
make O
. O
The O
beautiful O
suite O
of O
rooms O
were O
all O
thrown O
open O
, O
and O
|
      | O
perceiving O
Caroline B-PERSON
standing O
by O
the O
piano O
in O
an O
adjoining O
apartment O
, O
Percy B-PERSON
called O
out O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
Play O
us O
a O
waltz O
, O
Caroline B-PERSON
, O
there O
's O
a O
love O
  O
the O
very O
liveliest O

can O
find O

Tiny O

I O
want O

      | O
to O
try O
the O
boards O
while O
we O
can O
enjoy O
them O
to O
perfection O
, O
that O
is O
, O
when O
we O
are O
the O
only O
persons O

      | O
in O
the O
room O

" O
| 
  | O
" O
You O
must O
excuse O
me O
, O
Percy B-PERSON
, O
" O
she O
replied O
somewhat O
pettishly O
. O
" O
I O
should O
think O
you O
would O
have O
|
      | O
dancing O
enough O
in O
the O
course O
of O
the B-TIME
evening I-TIME
  O
and O
what O
will O
our O
friends O
think O
, O
if O
they O
come O
and O
|
      | O
find O
me O
playing O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Think O
? O
why O
, O
that O
you O
are O
very O
obliging O
, O
which O
at O
present O
you O
are O
not O

answered O
Percy B-PERSON
, O
|
      | O
laughing O
  O
" O
never O
mind O
, O
Emmy B-PERSON
  O
let O
us O
try O
what O
our O
united O
lungs O
will O
do O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
You O
may O
if O
you O
like O
, O
Percy B-PERSON
, O
but O
really O
I O
am O
not O
clever O
enough O
to O
dance O
and O
sing O
at O
the O
same O

      | O
time O
— O
I O
should O
have O
no O
breath O
left O

her O

joyous O
rejoinder O

" O
Come O
and O
dance O
, O
Caroline B-PERSON
, O
if O
you O
will O
not O
play O

exclaimed O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
who O
after O
decorating O
his O

      | O
button O

hole O
with O
a O
sprig O
of O
holly O
, O
seemed O
seized O
with O
Percy B-PERSON

dancing O

mania O
. O
" O
Do O
give O
me O
an O

" O
Without O

Lina B-PERSON

" O
observed O
her O
brother O
, O
very O
dryly O
  O
and O
as O
Emmeline B-ORG

      | O
begged O
him O
not O
to O
tease O
her O
, O
he O
asked O
— O

  | O
" O
What O
has O
put O
her O
in O
this O
ill O

humor O

Emmy B-PERSON

" O

  | O
" O
Oh O
, O
I O
do O
n't O

if O
you O

her O
alone O

soon O
recover O
it O

" O

Take O
care O

Percy B-PERSON

if O
you O
try O
to O
turn O
my O
head O
with O
such O
speeches O

      | O
punish O
you O

said O
his O
little O
sister O
, O
shaking O
her O
head O
at O
him O
with O
a O

      | O
comic O

of O

  | O
" O
That O

forward O
with O
a O
smile O
  O

" O

Emmeline B-PERSON

rejoined O
Percy B-PERSON
, O
shrugging O
his O
shoulders O
with O
horror O
at O
the O
idea O
  O
" O
I O

      | O
should O
cry O

continued O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
" O

surely O
that O

be O
a O
great O
misfortune O

" O
Indeed O
it O

surely O
too O

willfully O

out O

arrange O

it O

with O
marked O

emphasis O

hard O

answered O
Emmeline B-PRODUCT
, O
very O
eagerly O
  O
but O
|
      | O
Percy B-PERSON
said O
impetuously O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
am O
not O
, O
Emmeline B-PERSON

I O
would O
lay O
any O
wager O
that O
some O
thing O

gone O
wrong O
with O
her O
dressing O
, O

      | O
to O
- O
night O
, O
and O
so O
made O
her O
pettish O
. O
Her O
frock O
is O
not O
smart O
enough O
, O
or O
she O
does O
not O
wear O
the O

      | O
ornaments O
she O
wished O
, O
or O
some O
such O
thing O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Caroline B-PERSON
had O
fortunately O
quitted O
the O
music O
- O
room O
, O
or O
this O
speech O
would O
not O
have O
tended O
to O
|
      | O
restore O
her O
serenity O
  O
but O
before O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
could O
reply O
, O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
been O
to O
seek O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
|
      | O
burst O
into O
the O
room O
exclaiming O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
Now O
, O
Percy B-PERSON
, O
we O
may O
have O
a O
proper O
waltz O

aunt O
Emmeline B-ORG

we O
may O
have O
just O
one O
before O
any O

      | O
one O
comes O
, O

here O
she O
is O
to O
play O
for O
us O
, O
and O
Ellen B-PERSON
for O
my O
partner O
, O
" O
and O
they O
enjoyed O
it O
in O
|
      | O
earnest O
. O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
watched O
them O
for O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
, O
and O
then O
went O
to O
seek O
his O
elder O
|
      | O
girl O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
was O
alone O
in O
a O
little O
room O
prepared O
for O
refreshments O
, O
tastefully O
arranging O
some O
|
      | O
beautiful O
flowers O
in O
a O
bouquet O
. O
She O
looked O
up O
as O
he O
entered O
, O
and O
so O
smiled O
that O
her O
fond O
|
      | O
father O
thought O
Percy B-PERSON
must O
be O
wrong O
, O
for O
there O
certainly O
seemed O
no O
trace O
of O
ill O
- O
temper O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Why O
are O
you O
not O
with O
your O
brothers O
and O
sister O
in O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
, O
my O
dear O
? O
and O
why O
did O
you O
|
      | O
just O
now O
refuse O
your O
brother O
such O
a O
trifling O
favor O
as O
playing O
a O
waltz O
? O
" O
he O
asked O
, O
but O
so O
|
      | O
kindly O
, O
that O
Caroline B-PERSON
, O
though O
she O
blushed O
deeply O
, O
instantly O
replied O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
Because O
, O
papa O
, O
my O
temper O
was O
not O
quite O
restored O
  O
I O
went O
into O
the O
music O

room O

try O
mamma O

      | O
remedy O
of O
solitude O
for O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
, O
but O
Percy B-PERSON
spoke O
to O
me O
before O
I O
had O
succeeded O
. O
I O
know O
I O
|
      | O
answered O
him O
pettishly O
, O
but O
indeed O
, O
papa O
, O
" O
she O
added O
, O
looking O
up O
earnestly O
in O
his O
face O
, O
|
      | O
" O
indeed O
he O
is O
very O
provoking O
sometimes O
. O
" O

" O

know O

not O
always O

how O
to O
time O
his O
jokes O
, O
or O
to O
make O
sufficient O

      | O
allowance O
for O
dispositions O
not O
exactly O
like O
his O
own O
  O
but O
tell O
me O
, O
what O
first O
occasioned O
temper O
|
      | O
so O
to O
fail O
that O
solitude O
was O
necessary O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Caroline B-GPE
's O
blush O
became O
still O
deeper O
, O
and O
she O
turned O
away O
her O
head O
saying O
, O
very O
|
      | O
hesitatingly O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
For O
such O
a O
very O
, O

very O

silly O
reason O

papa O
, O
that O
I O
do O
not O

you O

" O

" O
Nay O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
do O
not O
fear O
that O
I O
shall O
either O
laugh O
at O
or O
reproach O
you O

If O
you O
feel O

      | O
yourself O
how O
very O
silly O
it O
was O
, O
I O
am O
not O
afraid O
of O
its O
gaining O
too O
great O
ascendency O
, O
even O
if O

      | O
you O
fail O
again O

" O

  | O
" O
It O
was O
only O
— O
only O
— O
that O
I O
was O
not O
quite O
satisfied O
with O
the O
dress O
mamma O
desired O
me O
to O
wear O

      | O
to O
- O
night O

all O

indeed O

to O
wear O
a O

replied O
her O
father O
, O
kissing O
her O

      | O
glowing O
cheek O
so O
affectionately O
, O
that O
the O
pain O
of O
her O
confession O
was O
instantly O
soothed O
  O
" O

, O

      | O
indeed O
, O
I O
think O
mamma O
has O
shown O
a O
much O
better O
taste O

It O
requires O
more O
care O

perhaps O
aware O
of O
to O
dress O
so O
exactly O

our O
age O

ourselves O

no O

the O

Percy B-PERSON

      | O
Cecil O

Lilla B-PERSON
were O
soon O
provided O
with O
little O
partners O

and O
dancing O
with O
much O
more O
real O

      | O
delight O
than O
their O
sister O

It O
was O
scarcely O
possible O
for O
any O
one O
, O
much O
less O
a O
parent O
, O
to O
look O
at O
Caroline B-GPE
that B-TIME
night I-TIME

      | O
without O
admiration O
. O
She O
was O
so O
animated O
, O
so O
graceful O
, O
so O
pleasing O
, O
and O
as O
such O
completely O
the O

      | O
center O
of O
attraction O
( O
and O
really O
without O
any O
effort O
on O
her O
part O
) O
to O
all O
the O
gentlemen O
, O
young O

      | O
or O
old O
in O
the O
room O
. O
The O
lads O
congregated O
round O
her O
, O
and O
it O
was O
rather O
a O
difficult O
task O
to O
keep O
|
      | O
clear O
of O
offense O
, O
when O
so O
very O
many O
more O
entreated O
her O
to O
dance O
than O
the O
length O
of O
the O
evening B-TIME
|
      | O
permitted O
  O
but O
she O
managed O
to O
talk O
to O
all O
, O
and O
yet O
not O
to O
neglect O
any O
of O
her O
own O
sex O
, O
for O
she O
|
      | O
always O
refused O
to O
dance O
, O
if O
she O
fancied O
her O
being O
in O
a O
quadrille O
prevented O
any O
couple O
who O
had O
|
      | O
not O
danced O
so O
much O
, O
and O
at O
those O
times O
contrived O
to O
conciliate O
five B-CARDINAL
or O
six B-CARDINAL
instead O
of O
only O
|
      | O
one O
. O
Emmeline O
took O
charge O
of O
the O
younger O
children O
, O
often O
refusing O
to O
dance O
with O
older O
boys O
, O
|
      | O
who O
would O
have O
made O
her O
much O
pleasanter O
partners O
, O
that O
she O
might O
join O
the O
little O
quadrille O
and O
|
      | O
set O
them O
all O
right O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
am O
really O
glad O
to O
see O
Ellen B-PERSON
among O
us O
to O
- O
night O
, O
and O
seeming O
truly O
to O
enjoy O
herself O

" O
said O

      | O
Mrs. O
Greville B-PERSON
, O
addressing O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
standing O
rather O
apart O
at O
the O
moment O
, O
watching O
|
      | O
Caroline B-GPE
with O
such O
mingled O
feelings O
of O
pride O
and O
dread O
, O
that O
she O
was O
quite O
glad O
when O
her O
|
      | O
friend O
's O
voice O
disturbed O
her O
train O
of O
thought O
. O
" O
She O
looked O
so O
ill O
in O
church O
yesterday B-DATE
, O
that O
I O
|
      | O
half B-CARDINAL
feared O
we O
should O
not O
see O
her O
. O
I O
told O
her O
I O
was O
quite O
grieved O
that O
she O
was O
too O
unwell O
to O
|
      | O
be O
at O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
's O
last B-DATE
Friday I-DATE
, O
and O
— O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
What O
did O
she O
say O
? O
" O
inquired O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
anxiously O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
That O
it O
was O
not O
illness O
which O
prevented O
her O
  O
but O
she O
looked O
so O
confused O
and O
pained O
that O
I O
|
      | O
changed O
the O
subject O
directly O
, O
and O
the O
smile O
soon O
came O
back O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
You O
touched O
on O
a O
very O
painful O
theme O
, O

replied O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
with O
real O
relief O
  O
" O
Ellen B-PERSON
and O
I O
|
      | O
were O
not O
quite O
as O
good O
friends O
as O
we O
usually O
are O
, O
last B-DATE
week I-DATE
, O
and O
my O
poor O
little O
girl O
felt O
my O
|
      | O
severity O
more O
than O
I O
imagined O
or O
meant O
. O
I O
gave O
her O
to O
your O
dear O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
especial O
care O
to O
- O
night O
, O
|
      | O
for O
she O
is O
so O
timid O
, O
that O
left O
quite O
to O
herself O
, O
I O
was O
afraid O
it O
would O
be O
more O
pain O
than O
|
      | O
pleasure O
. O
Mary B-PERSON
has O
taken O
my O
hint O
most O
admirably O
, O
for O
Ellen B-PERSON
seems O
quite O
happy O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
It O
would O
be O
rather O
hard O
, O
if O
your O
little O

were O
the O
only O
sad O
face O
in O
this O
scene O

" O
If O
you O

so O
Mrs. O

you O
will O
agree O
with O
my O
friend O
Morton B-PERSON

has O
just O
been O
half B-CARDINAL

poetizing O
half B-CARDINAL
philosophizing O
on O
this O
scene O

Mr. O

joining O
them O
, O
with O
the O
young O

      | O
clergyman O
leaning O
on O
his O
arm O

" O
He O
says O
there O
is O
something O
singularly O

the O
countenances O

rejoined O
Mrs. O

  | O
" O
Indeed O
I O
do O
not O

much O
more O
pleasure O
to O
me O
in O
watching O

a O
scene O

than O
a O
similar O

      | O
one B-CARDINAL

It O
is O
full O

kind O
of O
poetry O

, O
from O
the O
beauty O
and O
freshness O

creates O
a O
future O
of O
happiness O

good O

evil O

as O
something O
in O
each O

dimly O
to O
foretell O

How O

" O

  | O
He O
answered O
in O
the O
affirmative O
, O
but O
Mr. O

shook O
his O
head O

" O
I O

" O
Childhood B-ORG
feels O
its O
griefs O
as O
bitterly O
as O
|
      | O
those O
of O
maturer O
years O
. O
We O
are O
apt O
to O
think O
it O
was O
all O
joy O
in O
the O
retrospect O
, O
perhaps O
because O

      | O
it O
has O
not O
the O
anxiety O

cares O
of O
riper O
years B-DATE
, O
but O
sorrow O
itself O
is O
felt O
as O
keenly O

From O

      | O
reason O
not O

Morton B-PERSON
, O
believe O
me O
, O
these O
are O
trials O

full O
of O
suffering O

as O
hard O

" O

" O
You O
may O
be O
right O
, O
" O
replied O
Morton B-PERSON
  O
" O
but O
do O
you O
not O
think O
there O
is O
an O
elasticity O
in O
|
      | O
childhood O
which O
flings O
off O
sorrow O
, O
and O
can O
realize O
happiness O
sooner O
than O
older O
years O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Undoubtedly O
, O
and O
most O
happy O
it O
is O
that O
they O
are O
so O
constituted O
, O
else O
what O
would O
become O
of O
|
      | O
them O
if O
their O
susceptibilities O
for O
either O
joy O
or O
sorrow O
are O
equally O
quick O
. O
If O
the O
former O
did O
|
      | O
not O
balance O
the O
latter O
, O
how O
would O
their O
tender O
frames O
and O
quick O
affections O
bear O
their O
burden O
? O
|
      | O
The O
idea O
that O
childhood O
is O
in O
itself O
the O
happiest O
season O
in O
life O
is O
so O
far O
mischievous O
, O
that O

      | O
it O
prevents O
the O
necessary O
care O
and O
watchfulness O
, O
which O
alone O
can O
make O
it O
so O
. O
But O
we O
must O
not O

      | O
philosophize O
any O
more O
, O
for O
it O
has O
made O
us O
all O
grave O

I O

my O

addressing O
Miss B-PERSON

several O

seconded O
the O
move O

Annie B-PERSON

played O

remarkably O
well O

so O
far O
as O
execution O

brilliancy O
were O
concerned O

and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
was O

      | O
delighted O
at O
the O
expression O

his O

why O

has O
Helen B-PERSON
so O

foolishly O
cast O
away O
her O
happiness O

" O

      | O
was O
the O
thought O

followed O
at O
the O
contrast O

Lady B-PERSON

face O
presented O

well O

had O
heard O
it O
from O
very O
superior O
judges O

how O

      | O
could O
it O
concern O
her O

the O

company O
thought O

A O
very O
pretty O
vocal O
duet O

Caroline B-PERSON

stand O

Percy B-PERSON

Mr. O
Morton B-PERSON
were O
talking O

Percy B-PERSON
, O
with O
his O

      | O
usual O
love O
of O
provoking O
, O
exclaimed O
— O

" O
You O
surely O
are O
not O
going O

after O

Caroline B-PERSON

burned O

with O
spirit O

a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
afterward O
Mrs. O

led O
the O
blushing O

timid O

triumph O

the O

voice O

was O

thrilling O

not O
strong O

trembled O

audibly O
as O
she O
commenced O

Herbert B-PERSON
was O
turning O
over O
the O
leaves O
of O
her O
music O

his O
mother O
was O

      | O
standing O
close O
beside O
her O
, O
and O
after O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
few O
bars O
her O
enthusiastic O
spirit O
forgot O
the O

      | O
presence O

all O
, O

her O
song O

Mrs. O

never O

such O
moments O

a O
trembling O

foreboding O

vainly O

There O
was O
something O
in O
those O
deep O
blue O

earnest O

eyes O

the O
hectic O
color O

with O

her O

the O
transparency O
of O

      | O
complexion O

the O
warm O

elevated O
spirit O

the O
almost O
angel O
temper O
and O
endurance O
in O
her O

      | O
peculiarly O
tried O
lot O
, O
that O
scarcely O
seemed O
of O
earth O

never O
was O
that O
sad O
foreboding O

      | O
stronger O
than O
at O
that O
moment O

could O
scarcely O
command O
her O
voice O

smile O

      | O
sufficiently O
to O
warmly O
thank O
her O
young O

she O
ceased O
  O

Mary B-PERSON
was O
more O
than O

This O
little O
interruption O
to O
the O

increased O
the O
zest O

enjoyment O

when O

recommenced O

Even O

cleverly O
out O

Mrs. O

, O
feeling O
by O
the O

      | O
length O
of O
time O
the O
fatiguing O
dance O
had O
lasted O
, O
there O
was O
really O
some O
truth O
in O
his O
words O
, O

      | O
desired O
the O
musicians O
to O
stop O

an O
exclamation O
of O
regret O

youthful O
lips O

Emmeline B-PRODUCT

Edward B-PERSON
ran O
up O
to O

, O
to O
entreat O
that O

go O

little O

      | O
longer O

Mrs. O

, O
however O
, O
refused O
  O

Edward B-PERSON
yielded O
directly O
, O
but O
Emmeline B-PERSON
was O
so O
much O
|
      | O
excited O
, O
that O
obedience O
was O
most O
unusually O
difficult O
  O
and O
when O
her O
mother O
desired O
her O
to O
sit O

      | O
down O
quietly O
for O
ten B-TIME
minutes I-TIME

Mrs. O

most O
particularly O
|
      | O
wished O
to O
hear O
her O
play O
before O
she O
left O
, O
she O
answered O
, O
with O
more O
petulance O
than O
she O
was O
at O
all O

      | O
aware O
of O
— O

" O

gravely O
, O

The O
tone O
, O
still O
more O
than O
the O
words O

was O
enough O

poor O
Emmeline B-PRODUCT
was O
just O
in O
that O
mood O
when O

      | O
tears O
are O
quite O
as O
near O
as O
smiles O
  O
her O
own O
petulance O
seemed O
to O
reproach O
her O
too O
, O
and O
she O
|
      | O
suddenly O
burst O
into O
tears O
. O
Many O
exclamations O
of O
sympathy O
and O
condolence O
burst O
from O
her O

      | O
mother O

friends:—"Poor O

smile O

Her O
little O
girl O

      | O
thought O

tears O
were O
still O
on O

filling O
her O
eyes O

a O
blending O

      | O
of O
childish O
shyness O

yet O
courageous O
truth O

not O

with O

not O
letting O
me O

answering O
her O
so O

pettishly O
  O

I O
deserved O
it O

character O

only O
notice O
of O
a O
reply O
that O

: O

disagreeable O
task O

tacitly O
allowing O
that O

Emmeline O

timidly O
up O
in O
her O

sure O

a O
pretty O
picture O

her O
fairy O
figure O
with O
her O
tiny O
harp O

no O

I O

I O
shall O

      | O

Ellen B-PERSON

Emmeline B-ORG
both O
found O
it O
very O
difficult O
to O
like O
their O
lessons O
again O
  O
especially O
|
      | O
the O
latter O
, O
who O
felt O
as O
if O
work O
and O
regularity O
were O
most O
particularly O
disagreeable O
things O
, O
and O
|
      | O
sometimes O
was O
almost O
in O
despair O
as O
to O
her O
ever O
enjoying O
them O
again O
  O
but O
she O
tried O
very O
hard O

      | O
overcome O
indolence O
, O
and O
never O
give O
way O
to O
petulance O

and O
succeeded O
, O
so O
as O
to O
win O

      | O
delight O

both O
her O

' O

made O
her O
feel O
as O
if O
no O

      | O
her O
part O
was O
too O
great O

she O
felt O

when O
any O

experiences O
this O

need O
never O

afraid O

that O
they O
will O
succeed O
in O

      | O
their O
efforts O
, O
painful O
and O
hard O
as O
they O
may O
at O
first O
seem O
. O
It O
was O
not O
so O
difficult O
for O
Ellen B-PERSON
|
      | O
as O
for O
Emmeline B-ORG
, O
because O
she O
was O
less O
able O
to O
realize O
such O
an O
intensity O
of O
pleasure O
. O
She O
|
      | O
seemed O
safer O
when O
regularly O
employed O
  O
and O
besides O
, O
to O
work O
hard O
at O
her O
respective O
studies O
, O
was O
|
      | O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
very O
few O
things O
which O
she O
could O
do O
to O
prove O
how O
much O
she O
loved O
her O
aunt O
  O
and O
|
      | O
accustomed O
from O
such O
early O
childhood O
to O
conquer O
inclination O
, O
and O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
never O
to O
fancy O
|
      | O
pleasure O
and O
indulgence O
were O
her O
due O
, O
there O
was O
happiness O
enough O
for O
her O
even O
in O
their O
more O
|
      | O
regular O
life O
: O
but O
to O
Caroline B-GPE
the O
change O
was O
actually O
unbearable O
. O
While O
admiration O
and O
praise O
|
      | O
only O
incited O
Emmeline B-ORG
to O
greater O
exertions O
, O
they O
caused O
Caroline B-GPE
completely O
to O
relax O
in O
hers O
, O
|
      | O
and O
to O
give O
, O
in O
consequence O
, O
as O
much O
trouble O
and O
annoyance O
as O
she O
had O
received O
pleasure O

The O

      | O
perseverance O
in O
her O
various O
studies O
, O
especially O
in O
music O
, O
the O
unceasing O
control O
over O
her O
|
      | O
temper O
, O
which O
|  | O
before O
|  | O
the O
holidays O
she O
had O
so O
striven O
for O
, O
had O
now O
entirely O
given O
way O
. O
|
      | O
It O
was O
much O
less O
trouble O
for O
her O
to O
learn O
than O
Emmeline B-PRODUCT
, O
therefore O
her O
studies O
with O
Miss O
|
      | O
Harcourt B-GPE
were O
generally O
well O
performed O
  O
but O
the O
admiration O
she O
had O
excited O
made O
her O
long O
for O
|
      | O
more O
, O
and O
believe O
herself O
a O
person O
deserving O
much O
more O
consideration O
and O
respect O
than O
she O
|
      | O
received O
from O
her O
own O
family O
. O
These O
thoughts O
persisted O
in O
, O
of O
course O
, O
produced O
and O
retained O
|
      | O
ill O
- O
temper O
  O
which O
, O
as O
there O
was O
no O
longer O
any O
fear O
of O
her O
being O
debarred O
by O
its O
indulgence O
|
      | O
from O
any O
pleasure O
, O
she O
made O
no O
attempt O
to O
overcome O
. O
The O
praise O
bestowed O
on O
her O
music O
, O
made O
her O
|
      | O
fancy O
herself O
a O
much O
greater O
proficient O
than O
she O
really O
was O
, O
and O
though O
her O
love O
of O
music O
was O
|
      | O
great O
, O
her O
love O
of O
praise O
was O
greater O
  O
and O
so O
she O
not O
only O
relaxed O
in O
her O
practice O
, O
but O
|
      | O
inwardly O
murmured O
at O
the O
very O
little O
praise O
she O
received O
from O
her O
mother O
. O

interrupted O
Caroline B-PERSON
, O
and O
she O
left O
the O
room O
in O
anger O
. O
A O
faint O
flush O
rose O
|
      | O
to O
the O
pale O
cheek O
of O
her O
brother O
, O
but O
he O
quickly O
conquered O
the O
natural O
irritation O
, O
and O
sought O

      | O
his O
mother O
, O
by O
every O
fond O
attention O
on O
his O
part O
, O
to O
remove O
the O
pain O
of O
Caroline B-PERSON

conduct O

This O
continued O
for O
about O
a O
fortnight O
, O
at O
the O
end O
of O
which O
time O
, O
Caroline B-PERSON
suddenly O
resumed O
|
      | O
her O
music O
with O
assiduity O
, O
and O
there O
were O
no O
more O
ebullitions O
of O
ill O
- O
temper O
. O
Herbert B-PERSON
hoped O
his O
|
      | O
expostulations O
were O
taking O
effect O
  O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
trusted O
that O
her O
child O
was O
becoming O
sensible O
|
      | O
of O
her O
past O
folly O
, O
and O
trying O
to O
conquer O
it O
, O
and O
banish O
its O
memory O
herself O
: O
both O
, O
however O
, O
|
      | O
were O
mistaken O
. O
Annie B-PERSON
Grahame I-PERSON
had O
imparted O
to O
her O
friend O
, O
in O
strict O
confidence O
, O
that O
her O
mother O
|
      | O
intended O
giving O
a O
grand O
ball O
about O
the B-DATE
end I-DATE
of I-DATE
February I-DATE
, O
and O
meant O
to O
entreat O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
as O
|
      | O
a O
personal O
favor O
, O
to O
let O
Caroline B-PERSON
be O
present O
. O
Caroline B-PERSON
little O
knew O
the O
very O
slight O
foundation O
|
      | O
Annie B-ORG
had O
for O
this O
assertion O
. O
Lady B-PERSON
Helen I-PERSON
had O
merely O
said O
, O
|  | O
perhaps O
|  | O
she O
would O
ask O
  O
and O
|
      | O
this O
was O
only O
said O
, O
because O
she O
was O
too O
indolent O
and O
weak O
to O
say O
" O
No O
" O
at O
once O
. O
Not O
that O
she O
|
      | O
had O
any O
unkind O
feeling O
toward O
Caroline B-GPE
, O
but O
simply O
because O
she O
was O
perfectly O
certain O
Mrs. O
|
      | O
Hamilton B-PERSON
would O
not O
consent O
, O
and O
to O
persuade O
as O
earnestly O
as O
Annie B-PERSON
wished O
was O
really O
too O
much O
|
      | O
trouble O
. O
| 
  | O
Caroline B-GPE
's O
wishes O
in O
this O
instance O
triumphed O
over O
her O
better O
judgment O
, O
for O
had O
she O
allowed O
|
      | O
herself O
to O
think O
soberly O
, O
she O
ought O
to O
have O
known O
her O
mother O
's O
principles O
of O
action O
|
      | O
sufficiently O
, O
not O
to O
entertain O
the O
slightest O
hope O
of O
going O
. O

  | O
The O
invitations O
( O
three B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
' I-DATE
notice O
) O
for O
her O
parents O
and O
brothers O
came O
. O
In O
them O
she O
did O
not O
|
      | O
expect O
to O
be O
included O
, O
but O
when O
above O
a O
week O
passed O
, O
and O
still O
not O
a O
word O
was O
said O
, O
|
      | O
disappointment O
took O
the O
place O
of O
hope O
, O
and O
it O
was O
only O
the O
still O
lingering O
belief O
that O
she O
|
      | O
might O
go O
, O
even O
at O
the O
last O
moment O
, O
that O
prevented O
the O
return O
of O
ill O
- O
temper O
. O
| 
  | O
Now O
Lady B-PERSON
Helen I-PERSON
really O
had O
asked O
, O
though O
she O
did O
not O
persuade O
  O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
thanked O
her O
, O
|
      | O
but O
, O
as O
she O
expected O
, O
decidedly O
refused O
. O
" O
Caroline B-PERSON
was O
much O
too O
young O
, O
" O
she O
said O
, O
" O
for O
such O
a O
|
      | O
party O
. O
Did O
she O
know O
any O
thing O
about O
being O
asked O
? O
" O
Lady B-PERSON
Helen I-PERSON
said O
, O
with O
truth O
, O
that O
she O
had O
|
      | O
not O
mentioned O
the O
subject O
to O
her O
, O
and O
had O
desired O
Annie B-PERSON
to O
be O
equally O
silent O
. O
| 
  | O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
quite O
forgot O
that O
Miss O
Grahame B-PERSON
was O
not O
famous O
for O
obedience O
, O
and O
, O
relying O
on O
|
      | O
her O
friend O
's O
assurance O
, O
determined O
on O
not O
saying O
any O
thing O
to O
Caroline B-GPE
about O
it O
  O
wishing O
to O
|
      | O
spare O
her O
the O
pain O
which O
she O
knew O
her O
refusal O
would O
inflict O
. O
As O
it O
happened O
, O
it O
would O
have O
|
      | O
been O
better O
if O
she O
had O
spoken O
. O
The O
weather O
had O
prevented O
Caroline B-GPE
from O
seeing O
Annie B-PERSON
, O
but O
she O
|
      | O
was O
quite O
sure O
she O
would O
not O
deceive O
her O
  O
and O
her O
proud O
heart O
rebelled O
against O
her O
mother O
, O
not O
|
      | O
only O
for O
refusing O
Lady B-PERSON
Helen I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
request O
, O
but O
for O
treating O
her O
so O
much O
like O
a O
child O
, O
as O
to O
hide O
|
      | O
that O
refusal O
from O
her O
. O
Under O
the O
influence O
of O
such O
thoughts O
, O
of O
course O
, O
her O
temper O
became O
more O
|
      | O
and O
more O
difficult O
to O
control O
and O
as O
a O
natural O
consequence O
, O
anger O
and O
irritation O
against O
her O
|
      | O
mother O
, O
and O
self O
- O
reproach O
for O
the O
indulgence O
of O
such O
feelings O
increased O
, O
till O
she O
became O
|
      | O
actually O
miserable O
. O
| 
  | O
It O
happened O
that O
about O
this O
time O
Miss O
Harcourt B-PERSON
left O
Oakwood B-ORG
for O
a B-DATE
week I-DATE
on O
a O
visit O
to O
an O
|
      | O
invalid O
friend O
at O
Dartmouth B-ORG
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
had O
given O
her O
full O
liberty O
, O
promising O
that O
her O
|
      | O
pupils O
should O
lose O
nothing O
by O
her O
absence O
. O
She O
left O
on O
the O
Saturday B-DATE
, O
and O
the O
Thursday B-DATE
was O
Lady O

      | O
Helen B-GPE
's O
ball O
. O
On O
the O
Monday B-DATE
, O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
detained O
Edward B-PERSON
as O
he O
was O
leaving O
the O
library O
, O
|
      | O
after O
morning B-TIME
prayers O
, O
and O
told O
him O
that O
he O
had O
received O
a O
letter O
, O
which O
he O
thought O
might O

      | O
chance O
to O
interest O
him O
. O
Ten B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
afterward O
, O
Edward B-PERSON
rushed O
into O
the O
breakfast O
- O
room O
, O
in O
a O
|
      | O
state O
of O
such O
joyous O
excitement O
that O
he O
could O
scarcely O
speak O

" O

me O
five B-CARDINAL
, O
ten O
, O
twenty B-CARDINAL

joys O

" O
he O
exclaimed O
, O
springing O
from O
chair O
to O
chair O
, O
as O

      | O
if O
velocity O
of O
movement O

bring O
back O
speech O

" O

interposed O
Percy B-PERSON
laughing O

      | O
heartily O

loved O

as O
full O
of O
hope O

joy O

buoyancy O

where O
was O

his O
fate O

that O
of O
the O

beautiful O
boy O

      | O
Edward B-PERSON

his O
arms O
round O
her O

not O
all O
a O
dream O

she O

the O

prevent O

now O
the O

sudden O

so O
wild O
with O

- O
rat O
, O
who O
had O
|
      | O
no O
business O
whatever O
on O
land O
, O
before O
she O
could O
take O
her O
place O
at O
the O
breakfast O
table O
and O
try O
|
      | O
to O
smile O
. O
But O
her O
eyes O
would O
rest O
on O
Edward B-PERSON
even O
then O
, O
and O
she O
felt O
as O
if O
there O
were O
something O
|
      | O
across O
her O
throat O
and O
she O
could O
not O
swallow O
the O
nice O
roll O
which O
Herbert B-PERSON
, O
had O
so O
kindly O
|
      | O
buttered O
and O
cut O
, O
and O
so O
quietly O
placed O
in O
her O
plate O
  O
and O
when O
Edward B-PERSON
said O
something O
very O
|
      | O
funny O
, O
as O
he O
was O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
doing O
, O
and O
made O
them O
all O
laugh O
, O
she O
tried O
to O
laugh O
too O
, O
but O
|
      | O
instead O
of O
a O
laugh O
it O
was O
a O
sob O
that O
startled O
herself O
, O
for O
she O
was O
quite O
sure O
she O
did O
not O
mean O
|
      | O
to O
be O
so O
foolish O
: O
but O
instead O
of O
being O
reproved O
, O
as O
she O
was O
afraid O
she O
should O
be O
, O
she O
felt O
her O
|
      | O
aunt O
's O
arm O
thrown O
gently O
round O
her O
, O
till O
she O
could O
hide O
her O
face O
on O
her O
shoulder O
, O
and O
cry O
|
      | O
quite O
quietly O
for O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
, O
for O
they O
went O
on O
talking O
and O
laughing O
round O
the O
|
      | O
breakfast O
- O
table O
, O
and O
nobody O
took O
any O
notice O
of O
her O
, O
which O
she O
was O
quite O
glad O
of O
, O
for O
she O
could O
|
      | O
not O
bear O
Edward B-PERSON
to O
think O
she O
was O
unhappy O
when O
he O
was O
so O
pleased O
. O
And O
after O
breakfast O
, O
though O
|
      | O
he O
was O
in O
such O
a O
desperate O
hurry O
to O
tell O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
the O
good O
news O
, O
that O
when O
he O
did O
set O
off O
, O
|
      | O
he O
left O
even O
Percy O
far O
behind O
him O
, O
he O
found O
time O
to O
give O
her O
a O
hearty O
kiss O
, O
and O
to O
tell O
her O
|
      | O
that O
he O
loved O
her O
very O
much O
, O
though O
he O
could O
not O
help O
being O
so O
glad O
he O
was O
going O
to O
sea O
  O
and O
|
      | O
that O
he O
was O
quite O
proud O
of O
her O
, O
because O
though O
he O
knew O
she O
was O
very O
sorry O
he O
was O
going O
, O
she O
|
      | O
did O
not O
cry O
and O
make O
a O
fuss O
as O
some O
selfish O
people O
would O
  O
and O
then O
she O
really O
did O
smile O
. O

  | O
" O
It O
is O
Monday B-DATE
morning B-TIME
, O
my O
dears O

I O
find O
Ellis B-ORG

require O
my O
attention O

a O

      | O
longer O
time O
than O
I O
expected O
, O
" O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
said O
, O
as O
she O
entered O
the O
school O
- O
room O
, O
and O
found O
|
      | O
the O
three B-CARDINAL
girls O
preparing O
their O
books O
, O
" O
so O
I O
must O
set O
you O
all O
to O
work O
, O
and O
see O
how O
well O
you O
|
      | O
can O
get O
on O
without O
me O
till O
eleven O
, O
when O
I O
will O
rejoin O
you O

I O
shall O
order O
the O
carriage O
at O

      | O
half B-TIME
- I-TIME
past I-TIME
twelve I-TIME
, O
and O
if O
all O
I O
require O
is O
completed O
, O
we O
will O
pay O
your O
favorite O

Emmy B-PERSON
  O
the B-TIME
morning I-TIME
is O
so O
lovely O
, O
that O
I O
think O
we O
may O
venture O
to O
take O
our O
sketch O
- O
books O
, O
|
      | O
and O
see O
what O
other O
part O
of O
Berry B-LOC
Pomeroy I-LOC
we O
can O
take O
pencil O
possession O
of O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Such O
an O
anticipation O
was O
quite O
enough O
for O
Emmeline B-PRODUCT
. O
Her O
dance O
about O
the O
room O
was O
only O
|
      | O
checked O
by O
the O
idea O
that O
her O
lessons O
would O
never O
be O
ready O
, O
nor O
her O
exercises O
and O
sums O
done O
, O
|
      | O
unless O
she O
sat O
quietly O
down O
, O
and O
so O
, O
with O
a O
great O
effort O
, O
she O
gave O
all O
her O
attention O
to O
her O
|
      | O
various O
tasks O
, O
and O
mastered O
them O
even O
before O
her O
mother O
returned O
. O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
though O
she O
tried O
|
      | O
quite O
as O
much O
, O
was O
not O
so O
successful O
. O
The B-PERSON
Prince I-PERSON
William I-PERSON
would O
sail O
in O
miniature O
on O
her O
slate O
, O
|
      | O
over O
all O
her O
figures O
. O
The O
recollection O
of O
the O
awful O
storm O
they O
had O
encountered O
on O
their O
voyage O
|
      | O
to O
England B-GPE
would O
return O
so O
vividly O
, O
that O
the O
very O
room O
seemed O
to O
heave O
. O
And O
then O
— O
but O
she O
could O
|
      | O
not O
make O
out O
why O
she O
should O
think O
about O
that O
then O
— O
her O
mother O
's O
death O
- O
bed O
came O
before O
her O
and O
|
      | O
her O
promise O
, O
and O
it O
seemed O
harder O
still O
to O
part O
with O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
from O
a O
vague O
dread O
that O
came O
over O
|
      | O
her O
, O
but O
still O
she O
tried O
to O
attend O
to O
what O
she O
had O
to O
do O
, O
and O
congratulated O
herself O
on O
its O
|
      | O
completion O
before O
her O
aunt O
appeared O
. O
| 
  | O
Caroline B-GPE
, O
alone O
, O
was O
determined O
not O
to O
work O
. O
Because O
she O
had O
not O
made O
herself O
miserable O
|
      | O
enough O
already O
, O
the O
most O
unfounded O
jealousy O
entered O
her O
head O
from O
seeing O
her O
mother O
's O
|
      | O
caressing O
kindness O
toward O
Ellen B-PERSON
at O
breakfast O
  O
why O
was O
not O
her O
manner O
as O
kind O
to O
her O
! O
She O
was O
|
      | O
quite O
as O
unhappy O
, O
and O
her O
mother O
must O
see O
it O
, O
but O
she O
took O
no O
notice O
of O
her O
— O
only O
of O
Ellen B-PERSON
. O
She O
|
      | O
might O
be O
cross O
sometimes O
, O
but O
she O
never O
told O
stories O
or O
tried O
to O
hide O
her O
faults O
, O
and O
it O
was O
|
      | O
very O
hard O
and O
unjust O
that O
she O
should O
be O
treated O
so O
like O
a O
child O
, O
and O
Ellen B-PERSON
made O
so O
much O
of O
  O
|
      | O
and O
so O
she O
thought O
and O
thought O
, O
not O
attempting O
to O
do O
a O
single O
thing O
till O
she O
actually O
made O
|
      | O
herself O
believe O
, O
for O
the O
time O
, O
that O
her O
kind O
, O
indulgent O
mother O
had O
no O
love O
for O
her O
  O
and O
every O
|
      | O
thing O
looked O
blacker O
than O
before O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
made O
no O
effort O
to O
rouse O
herself O
even O
in O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
's O
presence O
, O
but O
listened O
to O
her O
|
      | O
remonstrances O
with O
such O
extreme O
carelessness O
, O
almost O
insolence O
, O
that O
her O
mother O
felt O
her O
|
      | O
patience O
failing O
. O
The O
self O
- O
control O
, O
however O
, O
for O
which O
she O
had O
successfully O
striven O
, O
enabled O
|
      | O
her O
so O
to O
overcome O
the O
irritation O
, O
as O
to O
retain O
her O
own O
quiet O
dignity O
, O
and O
simply O
to O
desire O
|
      | O
Caroline B-GPE
to O
give O
her O
attention O
at O
once O
to O
her O
studies O
, O
and O
conquer O
her O
ill O
- O
temper O
, O
or O
not O
to O
|
      | O
think O
of O
accompanying O
them O
on O
their O
excursion O
, O
as O
idleness O
and O
peevishness O
were O
better O
left O
to O
|
      | O
themselves O
. O
An O
insolent O
and O
haughty O
reply O
rose O
to O
Caroline B-GPE
's O
lips O
  O
but O
with O
an O
effort O
she O
|
      | O
remained O
silent O
, O
her O
flushed O
forehead O
alone O
denoting O
the O
internal O
agitation O
. O
Emmeline B-ORG
's O
|
      | O
diligence O
and O
the O
approbation O
she O
received O
irritated O
her O
still O
more O
  O
but O
she O
rejoiced O
when O
she O
|
      | O
heard O
her O
mother O
tell O
Ellen B-PERSON
there O
was O
not O
a O
correct O
line O
in O
her O
French B-NORP
exercise O
, O
and O
her O
sum O
, O
|
      | O
a O
compound O
long O
division O
, O
wrong O
from O
the O
very O
first B-ORDINAL
figure O
. O
But O
the O
pleasure O
soon O
gave O
place O
|
      | O
to O
indignant O
anger O
, O
when O
, O
instead O
of O
the O
reproof O
which O
she O
believed O
would O
follow O
, O
Mrs. O
|
      | O
Hamilton B-PERSON
said O
very O
kindly O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
should O
very O
much O
like O
these O
done O
correctly O
, O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
before O
we O
go O
out O
  O
suppose O
you O
ensconce O
|
      | O
yourself O
in O
that O
bay O
window O
, O
there O
are O
a O
table O
and O
chair O
all O
ready O
for O
you O
, O
and O
we O
shall O
not O
|
      | O
interrupt O
you O
as O
we O
should O
if O
you O
remain O
at O
this O
table O
. O
I O
know O
they O
are O
both O
very O
difficult O
, O

      | O
to O
- O
day O
especially O
, O

the O
more O
merit O
in O
their O
accomplishment O
, O
you O
know O
the O
more O
pleased O
I O
|
      | O
shall O
be O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Ellen B-PERSON
obeyed O
directly O
  O
a O
little O
care O
, O
and O
with O
the O
assistance O
of O
her O
grammar O
, O
which O
her O
aunt O
|
      | O
permitted O
her O
to O
refer O
to O
, O
instead O
of O
depending O
entirely O
on O
her O
memory O
that B-TIME
morning I-TIME
, O
enabled O
|
      | O
her O
to O
succeed O
with O
her O
French B-NORP
  O
but O
four B-CARDINAL
times O
was O
that O
tormenting O
sum O
returned O
to O
, O
till O
at O
|
      | O
last O
her O
tears O
effaced O
the O
figures O
as O
fast O
as O
they O
were O
written O

Still O
, O
patience O
and O
|
      | O
resolution O
in O
both O
teacher O
and O
pupil O
conquered O
, O
and O
the O
fifth B-ORDINAL
time O
there O
was O
not O
a O
figure O
|
      | O
wrong O
  O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
fondly O
putting O
back O
the O
heavy O
ringlets O
which O
in O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
absorbed O
|
      | O
attention O
had O
fallen O
over O
her O
tearful O
cheeks O
, O
said O
, O
playfully O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
Shall B-WORK_OF_ART
I I-WORK_OF_ART
tell I-WORK_OF_ART
you O
a O
secret O
, O
my O
little O
Ellen B-PERSON
? O
I O
was O
quite O
as O
disinclined O
to O
be O
firm O
this O
|
      | O
morning B-TIME
as O
you O
were O
to O
be O
patient O
  O
so O
you O
see O
we O
have O
both O
gained O
a O
grand O
victory O
. O
My O
|
      | O
conjuring O
propensities O
, O
as O
Emmy B-PERSON
thinks O
them O
, O
told O
me O
that O
you O
had O
real O
cause O
for O
some O
little O
|
      | O
inattention O
, O
and O
, O
therefore O
that O
it O
was O
very O
cruel O
in O
me O
to O
be O
so O
determined O
  O
but O
my O
|
        | O
judgment O
|  | O
would O
tell O
me O
that O
my O
|  | O
feeling O
|  | O
was O
wrong O
, O
and O
that O
to O
conquer O
|
      | O
disinclination O
and O
overcome O
a O
difficulty O
, O
was O
a O
much O
better O
way O
of O
lessening O
even O
natural O
|
      | O
sorrow O
than O
to O
give O
up O
. O
I O
do O
not O
expect O
you O
to O
think O
so O
just O
now O
, O
but O
I O
fancy O
you O
are O
not O
very O

      | O
sorry O
this O
disagreeable O
, O
terribly O
tiresome O
sum O

not O

it O

" O

  | O
Ellen B-PERSON
was O
so O
glad O
, O
that O
she O
felt O
almost O
happy O
, O
and O
her O
few O
other O
duties O
were O
done O
quite O
|
      | O
briskly O
, O
for O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
had O
been O
so O
kind O
as O
to O
countermand O
the O
carriage O
till O
one O
, O
that O
she O
|
      | O
and O
Caroline B-PERSON
might O
have O
time O
to O
finish O
. O
But O
Caroline B-PERSON
, O
if O
she O
had O
not O
tried O
before O
, O
was O
now O
|
      | O
still O
less O
capable O
of O
doing O
so O
. O
Every O
word O
of O
kindness O
addressed O
to O
Ellen B-PERSON
increased O
the O
storm O
|
      | O
raging O
within O
, O
and O
the O
difficulty O
of O
restraining O
it O
in O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
's O
presence O
caused O
it O
to O
|
      | O
burst O
forth O
with O
unmitigated O
violence O
the O
moment O
she O
quitted O
the O
apartment O
, O
desiring O
Emmeline B-ORG
|
      | O
and O
Ellen B-PERSON
to O
make O
haste O
, O
and O
put O
away O
their O
books O
, O
but O
still O
without O
taking O
the O
least O
notice O

      | O
of O
her O
. O
Invective O
, O
reproach O
, O
almost O
abuse O

were O
poured O
against O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
who O
stood O
actually O

      | O
frightened O
at O
the O
violence O
she O
had O
so O
very O
innocently O
excited O
, O
and O
at O
the O
fearful O
and O
|
      | O
deforming O
passion O
which O
inflamed O
her O
cousin O
's O
every O
feature O
. O
Caroline B-PERSON
's O
anger O
had O
miscounted O
|
      | O
time O
, O
or O
she O
must O
have O
known O
that O
her O
mother O
could O
not O
have O
gone O
far O
enough O
, O
for O
such O
unusual O
|
      | O
tones O
of O
excitement O
to O
escape O
her O
quick O
hearing O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
startled O
and O
alarmed O
, O
returned O
|
      | O
directly O
, O
and O
so O
vividly O
did O
her O
child O
's O
appearance O
and O
words O
recall O
her O
own O
misguided O
sister O
|
      | O
in O
those O
uncontrolled O
fits O
of O
fury O
, O
under O
which O
she O
had O
so O
often O
trembled O
, O
that O
present O
|
      | O
disappointment O
and O
dread O
for O
the O
future O
, O
took O
possession O
of O
her O
, O
and O
for O
the O
moment O
rendered O
|
      | O
her O
powerless O
. O
Caroline B-PERSON
was O
too O
much O
engrossed O
to O
perceive O
her O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
and O
she O
had O
, O
|
      | O
therefore O
time O
to O
rally O
from O
the O
momentary O
weakness O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
What O
does O
this O
mean O
? O
" O
she O
exclaimed O
, O
fixing O
her O
eyes O
on O
Caroline B-GPE
, O
with O
that O
expression O
of O
|
      | O
quiet O
but O
stern O
reproof O
, O
which O
when O
she O
did O
use O
it O
— O
and O
it O
was O
very O
seldom O
— O
had O
the O
power O
of O
|
      | O
subduing O
even O
the O
wildest O
excitement O
. O
" O
What O
has O
Ellen B-PERSON
done O
, O
that O
you O
should O
abuse O
her O
with O

      | O
this O
unjust O
and O
cruel O
and O
most O
unfeminine O
violence O
? O
You O
have O
indulged O
your O
ill O
- O
temper O
till O
you O
|
      | O
do O
not O
know O
what O
you O
say O
or O
do O
, O
and O
you O
are O
venting O
on O
another O
the O
anger O
which O
my O
displeasure O
|
      | O
has O
caused O
you O
to O
feel O
toward O
me O
and O
toward O
yourself O
. O
I O
desire O
that O
you O
will O
control O
it O
|
      | O
directly O
, O
or O
retire O
to O
your O
own O
room O
, O
till O
you O
can O
behave O
with O
some O
degree O
of O
propriety O

      | O
not O
disturb O
the O
comfort O

manner O

answered O
Caroline B-PERSON
, O
bursting O
into O
violent O
tears O
, O

scarcely O
aware O

Mrs. O

calmly O
turned O

      | O
for O
a O
moment O
to O
Emmeline B-NORP
and O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
who O
both O
stood O
bewildered O
, O
the O
former O
from O
actual O
terror O

      | O
that O
her O
sister O
should O
dare O
so O
to O
address O
her O
mother O
, O
and O
the O
latter O
from O
pain O
at O
the O
violent O

      | O
avowal O
of O
a O
dislike O
which O
she O
had O
intuitively O
felt O
, O

always O
tried O

disbelieve O

Emmeline O
longed O

throw O
her O
arms O
round O

said O

, O

Mrs. O

spoken O
cheerfully O

in O
quite O
her O
|
      | O
usual O
tone O
of O
voice O
to O
them O
, O
there O
was O
something O
in O
her O
countenance O
, O
that O
checked O
any O
display O

      | O
of O
softness O
even O
in O
her O
affectionate O
child O
  O
something O
that O
almost O
awed O
her O
, O

she O
left O
the O

      | O
room O
with O
Ellen B-PERSON

prepare O
for O
the O
promised O
excursion O

had O
, O
however O

lost O
all O

were O
alone O

      | O
again O
regarding O
Caroline B-PERSON

who O
was O
sobbing O
violently O

with O
that O

searching O
look O

" O
Your O

      | O
charges O

very O
heavy O

request O
you O

my O
absence O

arrange O

define O
them O

depression O
had O
a O
cause O

none O

if O
you O
were O

from O
your O

by O
encouragement O

blackened O
every O

one B-CARDINAL

Why O
was O
I O
such O
a O
fool O
, O
as O
not O
to O
tell O
mamma O
at O
once O

      | O
that O
I O
knew O
I O
was O
to O

wished O
so O
much O
to O
go?—if O
she O

me O

it O
would O
not O

have O
been O
half O
the O
pain O

for O

how O
can O
I O
meet O
papa O

eye O

Percy B-PERSON
's O

      | O
unkind O
jokes O
with O
eyes O

these O
? O
" O
she O
added O
, O
as O
on O
rising O
to O
go O
to O
her O
own O
room O
, O
she O
caught O
|
      | O
sight O
of O
her O
own O
face O
in O
a O
mirror O
, O
and O
actually O
started O
at O
the O
disfigurement O
which O
the O
|
      | O
violence O
of O
her O
emotion O
had O
wrought O
. O
" O
Oh O
, O
how O
I O
wish O
mamma O

not O
desired O
me O
to O
go O

her O
  O

I O
could O
but O
hide O
myself O
from O
every O
body O

get O
rid O
of O
this O
horrible O
black O
cloud O

From O
every O
eye O
but O
her O
mother O
's O
she O
could O
and O
did O
hide O
herself O
  O
for O
saying O
that O
her O
head O

      | O
ached O
, O
which O
was O
the O
truth O
, O

she O
did O
not O

any O
thing O

take O

down O

dinner O

Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
had O
successfully O
exerted O
herself O
during O
their O
excursion O
, O
and O
Emmeline O
|
      | O
and O
Ellen B-PERSON
enjoyed O
themselves O
so O
thoroughly O
as O
almost O
to O
forget O
the O
alloy O
of O
the B-TIME
morning I-TIME
  O
and O
|
      | O
even O
when O
Caroline B-PERSON
's O
message O
recalled O
it O
, O
the O
boys O
were O
all O
so O
merry O
, O
that O
it O
did O
not O
disturb O
|
      | O
them O
. O
Percy B-PERSON
always O
declared O
that O
Caroline B-GPE
's O
headache O
was O
only O
another O
term O
for O
temper O
- O
ache O
, O
|
      | O
and O
he O
would O
certainly O
have O
sent O
her O
some O
message O
of O
mock O
pity O
, O
if O
his O
quick O
eye O
had O
not O
|
      | O
discovered O
or O
fancied O
that O
his O
mother O
did O
not O
look O
quite O
as O
well O
as O
usual O
, O
and O
so O
he O
contented O
|
      | O
himself O
by O
trying O
still O
more O
to O
be O
the O
life O
of O
the O
dinner O
- O
table O
. O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
had O
seen O
at O
a O
|
      | O
single O
glance O
that O
all O
was O
not O
quite O
right O
, O
and O
Caroline B-GPE
's O
non O
- O
appearance O
and O
message O
|
      | O
explained O
it O
, O
to O
his O
extreme O
regret O
, O
for O
he O
had O
begun O
to O
hope O
and O
believe O
that O
his O
wife O
's O
|
      | O
extreme O
solicitude O
, O
on O
her O
account O
, O
was O
beginning O
to O
decrease O
. O
| 
  | O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
had O
not O
much O
doubt O
that O
silence O
and O
solitude O
had O
so O
far O
had O
effect O
on O
Caroline B-GPE
|
      | O
as O
to O
subdue O
passion O
, O
and O
bring O
her O
to O
a O
sense O
of O
her O
misconduct O
  O
but O
that O
had O
scarcely O
power O
|
      | O
to O
lessen O
the O
anxiety O
and O
the O
pain O
which O
Caroline B-ORG
's O
words O
had O
so O
wantonly O
inflicted O
. O
Had O
she O
|
      | O
indeed O
evinced O
any O
thing O
like O
undue O
partiality O
? O
the O
idea O
alone O
almost O
brought O
a O
smile O
  O
fondly O
, O
|
      | O
and O
almost O
as O
her O
own O
child O
, O
as O
she O
loved O
her O
little O
niece O
. O
The O
very O
anxiety O
Caroline B-PERSON
|
      | O
occasioned O
her O
, O
deepened O
her O
affection O
  O
the O
very O
control O
she O
was O
obliged O
to O
exercise O
in O
her O
|
      | O
mode O
of O
guiding O
her O
, O
strengthened O
every O
feeling O
toward O
her O
. O
She O
was O
so O
enwrapped O
in O
these O
|
      | O
painfully O
engrossing O
thoughts O
, O
in O
the O
strict O
examination O
of O
her O
own O
own O
heart O
, O
that O
she O
was O
|
      | O
not O
aware O
the O
time O
she O
had O
appointed O
had O
passed O
by O
full O
ten B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
, O
till O
she O
was O
roused O
by O
|
      | O
the O
handle O
of O
her O
door O
being O
softly O
turned O
, O
and O
left O
again O
, O
as O
if O
some O
one O
had O
wished O
to O
|
      | O
enter O
, O
but O
hesitated O
. O
The O
very O
hesitation O
gave O
her O
hope O
, O
for O
she O
really O
did O
not O
know O
that O
the O
|
      | O
utmost O
penalty O
she O
could O
have O
inflicted O
on O
Caroline B-GPE
, O
in O
the O
moment O
of O
natural O
indignation O
, O
|
      | O
would O
have O
failed O
in O
producing O
such O
an O
effect O
as O
the O
simple O
command O
to O
seek O
her O
, O
and O
define O
|
      | O
her O
charges O
against O
her O
, O
when O
that O
angry O
excitement O
had O
so O
calmed O
, O
that O
Caroline B-GPE
would O
have O
|
      | O
given O
worlds O
, O
if O
she O
might O
but O
have O
not O
referred O
to O
it O
again O
. O
She O
knew O
she O
dared O
not O
disobey O
, O
|
      | O
but O
her O
daring O
had O
left O
her O
so O
powerless O
that O
she O
had O
stood O
at O
her O
mother O
's O
door O
full O
ten B-CARDINAL
|
      | O
minutes B-TIME
before O
she O
could O
command O
courage O
sufficient O
to O
open O
it O
and O
enter O
. O
| 
  | O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
looked O
at O
her O
changed O
aspect O
, O
the O
bitter O
humiliation O
expressed O
in O
every O
|
      | O
feature O
, O
with O
such O
pity O
, O
that O
it O
required O
even O
more O
than O
her O
usual O
exercise O
of O
control O
, O
to O
|
      | O
retain O
the O
grave O
, O
and O
apparently O
unmoved O
tone O
with O
which O
she O
said O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
You O
have O
had O
a O
long O
time O
in O
which O
to O
reflect O
on O
your O
charges O
against O
me O
, O
Caroline B-PERSON
. O
I O
hope O
|
      | O
they O
are O
now O
sufficiently O
defined O
for O
me O
to O
understand O
and O
answer O
them O
. O
You O
may O
sit O
down O
, O
for O

      | O
you O
do O
not O
seem O
very O
capable O
of O
standing O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Caroline B-PERSON
gladly O
obeyed O
, O
by O
sitting O
down O
on O
a O
low O
ottoman O
, O
some O
little O
distance O
from O
her O
|
      | O
mother O
, O
on O
whose O
neck O
she O
absolutely O
longed O
to O
throw O
herself O
and O
beseech O
forgiveness O
  O
but O
Mrs. O
|
      | O
Hamilton B-PERSON
's O
tone O
was O
not O
such O
as O
to O
give O
her O
courage O
to O
do O
so O
. O
She O
remained O
silent O
, O
burying O
her O
|
      | O
face O
in O
her O
hands O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
am O
waiting O
your O
pleasure O

Caroline B-PERSON

should O
have O

plenty O

Caroline B-PERSON
  O
were O
I O
to O
condemn O
you O
to O
any O
punishment O

it O
would O
seem O
more O
like O
vengeance O

      | O
for O
the O
pain O
you O
have O
inflicted O
on O

by O
your O
accusation O

partiality O

from O
the O

You O
know O

well O

the O
origin O

your O

main O

that O
since O
Ellen B-PERSON

treated O

the B-DATE

have O
an O
answer O

Caroline B-GPE
  O
you O
may O
now O

think O
explanation O

not O
necessary O
, O

that O
you O
meant O
nothing O

you O
spoke O

that O
will O

      | O
not O
satisfy O
me O

you O
, O
when O
ill O

You O
need O
not O
refrain O
from O

from O

Few O

to O
flash O

in O

really O

on O

      | O
adherence O
to O

she O
so O
prided O
herself O

that O
there O
was O
no O
excuse O

her O
in O
the O
idea O

that O
she O
did O
not O

what O

for O
why O

religion O

so O
carefully O

implanted O
within O

evil O

though O
you O

lost O
such O

the O

not O

not O
from O

such O

Caroline B-PERSON

" O

  | O
Caroline B-PERSON
could O
not O
reply O
, O
for O
every O
kind O
word O
her O
mother O
spoke O
, O
seemed O
to O
heighten O
|
      | O
self O
- O
reproach O
, O
and O
make O
her O
still O
more O
wretched O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
felt O
that O
there O
was O
no O
refusal O
|
      | O
in O
her O
silence O
, O
and O
continued O
talking O
to O
her O
in O
that O
same O
gentle O
strain O
a O
little O
while O
longer O
, O
|
      | O
and O
then O
rose O
to O
leave O
her O
— O
but O
Caroline B-PERSON
looked O
so O
sorrowful O
that O
she O
hesitated O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
No O
, O
mamma O
, O
I O
do O
not O
deserve O
that O
you O
should O
stay O
with O
me O
, O
and O
so O
deprive O
Emmeline B-PRODUCT
and O

      | O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
and O
the O
boys O
of O
their O
favorite O
hour O
, O
" O
she O
said O
, O
though O
the O
tears O
started O
again O
to O
her O
|
      | O
eyes O
, O
for O
she O
felt O
as O
if O
it O
would O
be O
an O
indescribable O
comfort O
still O
to O
be O
alone O
with O
her O

      | O
mother O
. O
" O
I O
am O
too O
unhappy O

ashamed O

I O
may O
remain O
away O
? O
" O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON

      | O
answered O
in O
the O
affirmative O
. O
" O
I O
have O
not O

not O

indeed O

I O
do O

you O
any O
more O

I O
hate O

too O

" O

  | O
" O
Do O
not O
attempt O
to O
study O

- O
night O
, O
my O
dear O
Caroline B-PERSON
  O
get O
up O
a B-DATE
little I-DATE
earlier I-DATE
to O
- O
morrow O
, O
to O
|
      | O
be O
ready O
for O
me O
, O
if O
you O
like O
  O
but O
though O
it O
will O
be O
much O
more O
painful O
to O
you O
to O
remain O
idle O

      | O
the O
remainder O
of O
this B-TIME
evening I-TIME
than O
to O
employ O
yourself O
, O
even O
with O
the O
most O
disagreeable O
task O
, O
I O
|
      | O
would O
much O
rather O
you O
should O
do O
so O
. O
Once O
let O
temper O
be O
quite O
subdued O
, O
and O
your O
heart O
receive O
|
      | O
its O
necessary O
government O
, O
and O
I O
have O
no O
fear O
but O
that O
you O
will O
very O
quickly O
make O
up O
for O
lost O
|
      | O
time O
  O
and O
even O
if O
you O
did O
not O
, O
believe O
me O
, O
my O
dear O
child O
, O
the O
graces O
of O
the O
mind O
, O
precious O
as O

      | O
in O
general O
they O
are O
considered O
, O
and O
as O
they O
are O
, O
still O
are O
to O
me O
actually O
nothing O
worth O
, O
if O
|
      | O
unaccompanied O
by O
a O
gentle O
temper O
and O
womanly O
heart O
. O
Do O
not O
shrink O
from O
the O
suffering O
which O
it O
|
      | O
will O
be O
to O
sit O
alone O
and O
think O
on O
all O
that O
has O
passed O
to O
- O
day O
  O
but O
let O
your O
remorse O
be O
|
      | O
accompanied O
by O
a O
resolution O
( O
which O
you O
are O
quite O
capable O
of O
not O
only O
forming O
, O
but O
of O
keeping O
) O
|
      | O
not O
to O
rest O
till O
by O
prayer O
and O
effort O
you O
have O
sought O
God O
's O
blessing O
on O
your O
difficult O
task O
, O
|
      | O
and O
so O
feel O
strengthened O
for O
its O
fulfillment O
  O
and O
also O
for O
persevering O
in O
it O
, O
for O
you O
must O
not O

      | O
hope O
to O
succeed O
in O
subduing O
yourself O
all O
at O
once O
. O
Do O
this O
, O
and O
I O
shall O
be O
better O
pleased O
than O

      | O
if O
to O
- O
morrow O
morning O
you O
brought O
me O
a O
treble O
quantity O
of O
mental O
work O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
She O
embraced O
and O
left O
her O
— O
to O
meditations O
, O
from O
whose O
bitter O
, O
though O
salutary O
pain O
, O
Caroline B-PERSON
|
      | O
made O
no O
attempt O
to O
escape O
  O
though O
, O
had O
it O
not O
been O
for O
her O
mother O
's O
advice O
, O
she O
would O
gladly O
|
      | O
have O
flown O
to O
her O
studies O
, O
and O
worked O
with O
double O
assiduity O
, O
believing O
that O
she O
was O
, O
by O
doing O
|
      | O
so O
, O
atoning O
for O
her O
fault O
, O
instead O
of O
merely O
shrinking O
from O
its O
remembrance O
. O
It O
was O
a O
trial O
to O
|
      | O
join O
her O
family O
even O
for O
prayers O
  O
for O
she O
felt O
so O
self O
- O
convicted O
, O
so O
humbled O
, O
that O
she O
fancied O
|
      | O
every O
one O
must O
despise O
her O
  O
and O
when O
, O
after O
the O
service O
, O
Percy B-PERSON
approached O
, O
and O
, O
with O
mock O
|
      | O
sympathy O
, O
inquired O
how O
her O
headache O
was O
, O
and O
if O
she O
had O
recovered O
her O
appetite O
, O
and O
begged O
her O
|
      | O
not O
to O
be O
ill O
at O
such O
a O
critical O
time O
, O
as O
he O
most O
particularly O
wished O
to O
go O
to O
Lady B-PERSON
Helen I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
|
      | O
ball O
, O
and O
he O
could O
not O
be O
so O
cruel O
, O
if O
she O
were O
not O
well O
, O
her O
spirit O
was O
so O
broken O
that O
the O
|
      | O
large O
tears O
rolled O
down O
her O
cheeks O
, O
and O
she O
turned O
away O
without O
uttering O
a O
single O
word O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
If O
you O
had O
taken O
the O
trouble O
to O
look O
in O
your O
sister O
's O
face O
, O
Percy B-PERSON
, O
you O
would O
not O
have O
|
      | O
spoken O
so O
unkindly O
, O
" O
said O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
more O
hastily O
than O
she O
was O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
|
      | O
interfering O
  O
and O
as O
Caroline B-PERSON
came O
to O
her O
, O
she O
whispered O
some O
few O
fond O
words O
, O
that O
enabled O
her O
|
      | O
to O
wish O
her O
father O
good O
- O
night O
and O
leave O
the O
room O
, O
without O
any O
farther O
display O
of O
emotion O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Do O
you O
wish O
your O
sister O
to O
dislike O
you O
, O
Percy B-PERSON
? O
" O
she O
said O
gently O
detaining O
him O
, O
as O
he O
was O
|
      | O
following O
Caroline B-GPE
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Dislike O
me O

No O
! O
how O
can O
you O

" O

you O
act O

make O
her O
more O
so O

is O
that O
kind O

How O
can O

ever O

up O

love O
you O

my O

up O

so O
conquered O
herself O
, O
that O
she O
could O
listen O

      | O
to O
Percy B-PERSON
's O
flowing O
account O
of O
its O
delights O

It O

self O

reproach O

that O
she O
could O
scarcely O
think O

without O
pain O
  O
but O
she O
was O
so O
convinced O

her O
folly O
in O
permitting O
such O
a O
very O
little O
thing O
so O
to O
affect O
her O
temper O
as O
to O
cause O

the O

not O
only O
by O
listening O

by O

was O
a O

really O
a O
strong O
mind O
, O

once O

convinced O
of O
error O
, O
once O
released O
from O
the O
fell O
dominion O
of O

, O
she O
did O
not O
care O
what O
pain O

she O
endured O
, O
or O
what O
difficulty O
she O

convince O

how O

truly O
she O
regretted O

tried O
to O
atone O
for O
past O

It O
was O
very O
easy O
, O
as O
Mrs. O

told O
her O

to O

not O
quite O

check O
the O

unkind O

break O
from O
the O
black O
cloud O
that O
still O
at O
times O
would O

envelop O

she O
did O
not O

way O

making O

much O
against O

so O
entreated O
her O
mother O
to O
invite O
Caroline B-PERSON
to O
spend O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
days I-DATE
with O
her O
  O
and O
to O
her O

      | O
astonishment O
, O
her O
cold O
, O
harsh O
father O
volunteered O
to O
go O
himself O
for O
her O
. O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
at O
once O
|
      | O
acceded O
  O
his O
wife O
hesitated O
  O
but O
she O
went O
at O
once O
to O
Caroline B-GPE
, O
who O
chanced O
to O
be O
reading O
alone O

      | O
in O
the O
school O
- O
room O
, O
for O
it O
was O
the O
time O
of O
recreation O
, O
and O
told O
her O
. O
For O
a O
moment O
her O
|
      | O
countenance O
was O
actually O
radiant O
with O
delight O
, O
the O
next O
it O
clouded O
over O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
You O
would O
like O
it O
very O
much O
, O
but O
you O
are O
afraid O
I O
shall O
not O
permit O
you O
to O
go O
— O
is O
that O
the O
|
      | O
meaning O
of O
your O
change O
of O
countenance O
? O
" O
asked O
her O
mother O
, O
half B-CARDINAL
smiling O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
am O
afraid O
of O
myself O

mamma O

for O
I O
fear O
I O
am O
always O
more O
ill O
- O
tempered O
and O
proud O
after O
any O
|
      | O
such O
pleasure O
as O
going O
to O
Moorlands B-GPE
would O
be O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Would O
you O
rather O
not O
go O
, O
then O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
can O
not O
say O
quite O
that O
, O
mamma O
  O
I O
should O
like O
it O
very O
much O
, O
if O
I O
could O
but O
be O
sure O
of O

      | O
myself O
afterward O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Did O
you O
ever O
feel O
such O
a O
doubt O
of O
yourself O
before O
, O
Caroline B-PERSON
, O
when O
going O
to O
stay O
with O

      | O
Annie B-PERSON
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
No O
, O
mamma O
  O
I O
seem O
to O
have O
thought O
a O
great O
deal O
more O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
few I-DATE

" O
Then O
I O
think O
there O
is O
less O
danger O
for O
you O
, O
that O
is O
, O
of O
course O
, O
if O
you O
are O
willing O
to O
risk O

      | O
the O
temptation O
of O
Lady B-PERSON
Helen I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
too O
kind O
consideration O
and O
lavish O
praises O
, O
which O
make O
mine O
so O

      | O
very O
tame O

" O

  | O
" O
Oh O
, O
mamma O
, O
pray O
do O
not O

interrupted O
Caroline B-PERSON
, O
very O
eagerly O
. O
" O
Indeed O

I O
would O
rather O

hear O
you O
speak O

see O
you O
smile O
as O
you O

listen O
to O
all O
that O
Lady B-PERSON

is O
so O
kind O

      | O
as O
to O
say O

I O
know O
I O
did O
like O
it O
very O
much O
, O
and O
that O
it O
did O
sometimes O
make O
me O
fancy O
when O
I O
came O
|
      | O
home O
, O
that O
you O
were O
almost O
cold O
. O
But O
, O
indeed O
, O
indeed O
, O
I O
hope O
I O
am O
learning O

      | O
better O

too O

But O
Mr. O

waiting O
for O
you O
  O

, O
by O

the O

begged O
me O
to O

      | O
ask O
you O
for O
some O
lines O
you O
promised O
to O
copy O
out O
for O
a O
print O
in O
Lady B-PERSON
Helen I-PERSON

album O
. O
You O
may O
do O
|
      | O
just O
as O
you O
like O
about O
going O
, O
because O
you O
are O
quite O
old O
and O
wise O
enough O
to O
decide O
for O
|
      | O
yourself O
. O
Ill O
- O
temper O
always O
brings O
such O
suffering O
with O
it O
, O
that O
if O
pleasure O
must O
recall O
it O
, O
|
      | O
you O
will O
be O
wiser O
not O
to O
go O
  O
but O
if O
you O
can O
resist O
it O
— O
if O
you O
think O
you O
can O
return O
to O
your O

      | O
quiet O
daily B-DATE
routine O
as O
forbearing O

gentle O

happy O
as O
you O
are O
now O

go O

my O
love O

yourself O

" O
I O
will O
try O

remember O
all O
you O
said O
about O

we O
are O
most O
secure O

dear O

      | O
mamma O

" O
answered O
Caroline B-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
very O
earnest O
and O
somewhat O
lowered O
voice O
. O
" O
I O
know O
, O
whenever O
I O

      | O
have O
been O
to O
Moorlands B-GPE
before O

I O
have O
felt O
so O
elated O
, O
so O
sure O
I O
should O
never O
be O
in O
an O
|
      | O
ill O
- O
temper O
, O
so O
proud O
from O
being O
made O
so O
much O
of O
, O
that O
I O
fear O
I O
have O
very O
often O
relaxed O
even O
in O
|
      | O
my O
daily O
prayers O
, O
and O
never O
thought O
it O
necessary O
to O

against O
ill O

Do O
you O
think O
if O
I O

      | O
watch O
myself O
, O
and O
still O
pray O
against O
it O

it O
will O
save O

unkind O

" O
It O
will O
undoubtedly O
help O
you O

my O
dear O
child O

very O
considerably O
, O
and O
render O
your O
trial O
very O

      | O
much O
easier O
, O
but O
I O
can O
not O
promise O
you O
that O
it O
will O
entirely O
prevent O
the O

inclination O

feel O
pettish O

unhappy O

I O
have O
no O

in O

prevent O
even O
that O

now O

very O
early B-DATE

forgotten O
the O
bitter O
pain O
of O
last B-DATE

      | O
still O
I O
think O
you O
may O
venture O

go O

love O

if O
I O
do O
see O
you O
happy O

gentle O
on O
your O

it O
will O
do O
much O
toward O
convincing O
me O

striving O

Make O
haste O

get O

      | O
ready O

do O
not O
forget O
the O
poem O

I O
will O
send O
over O
your O
things O
. O
Tell O
Lady B-PERSON
Helen I-PERSON
I O
shall O

      | O
expect O
all O
her O
family O
next B-DATE
Monday I-DATE
evening B-TIME

to O
join O
Edward B-PERSON

you O
can O

them O

" O
| 
  | O
With O
the O
most O
delighted O
alacrity O
Caroline B-PERSON
hastened O
to O
get O
ready O
, O
and O
in O
her O
hurry O
forgot O
the O

      | O
poem O
till O
she O
re O
- O
entered O
the O
school O

room O
, O
which O
was O
still O
untenanted O

" O
What O
shall O
I O
do O
for O
some O
writing O
- O
paper O
? O
" O
she O
thought O
  O
" O
the O
desks O
are O
all O
put O
away O

and O
it O

      | O
will O
detain O
me O
so O
long O
to O
go O
up O
again O
for O
the O
keys O
, O
and O
the O
volume O
is O
too O
large O
to O
carry O
— O
oh O
, O
I O
|
      | O
will O
tear O
out O
a O
blank O
page O
from O
this O
book O

it O
will O
not O
be O
very O
elegant O
, O
but O
I O
can O
recopy O
it O
at O
|
      | O
Moorlands B-GPE
. O
" O
| 
  | O
And O
she O
hastily O
tore O
out O
a O
page O
from O
an O
exercise O
- O
book O
which O
lay O
open O
on O
the O
table O
  O
not O

      | O
perceiving O
that O
by O
doing O
so O
, O
a O
fellow O
- O
leaf O
, O
which O
was O
written O
on O
, O
was O
loosened O
, O
and O
fell O
to O

      | O
the O
ground O
, O
mingling O
with O
some O
torn O
papers O
which O
had O
been O
put O
in O
a O
heap O
to O
be O
cleared O
away O

      | O
She O
had O
just O
finished O
it O
, O
when O
Fanny B-ORG
came O
to O
tell O
her O
Mr. O
Grahame B-PERSON
could O
not O
wait O
any O
longer O
, O

      | O
and O
asking O
if O
all O
the O
papers O
on O
the O
ground O
were O
to O
be O
removed O
, O
Caroline B-PERSON
hastily O
answered O
in O

      | O
the O
affirmative O
, O
without O
looking O
at O
them O
, O
and O
the O
girl O
bore O
them O
off O
in O
her O
apron O
, O
the O
written O

      | O
leaf O
among O
them O
. O
| 
  | O
Now O
it O
so O
happened O
that O
this O
written O
leaf O
had O
already O
occasioned O
trouble O
. O
Miss O
Harcourt B-PERSON
had O
|
      | O
been O
so O
displeased O
with O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
careless O
performance O
of O
a O
French B-NORP
exercise O
that O
morning O
, O
that O
|
      | O
she O
had O
desired O
her O
to O
write O
it O
again O
. O
It O
was O
very O
difficult O
, O
and O
had O
materially O
shortened O
the O
|
      | O
time O
which O
she O
had O
promised O
to O
devote O
to O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
this B-DATE
week I-DATE
released O
from O
his O
|
      | O
attendance O
on O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
, O
to O
permit O
him O
and O
Ellen B-PERSON
to O
be O
as O
much O
together O
as O
possible O
. O
Hurried O
|
      | O
by O
him O
, O
she O
left O
her O
book O
open O
on O
the O
table O
to O
dry O
, O
and O
, O
finding O
it O
closed O
on O
her O
return O
, O
put O
|
      | O
it O
away O
, O
without O
looking O
at O
it O
. O
The O
following O
day O
Miss O
Harcourt B-PERSON
, O
of O
course O
, O
requested O
to O
see O
|
      | O
it O
, O
and O
, O
to O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
utter O
astonishment O
, O
her O
exercise O
was O
not O
there O
  O
only O
the O
faulty O
and O
|
      | O
blotted O
theme O
, O
with O
no O
sign O
to O
explain O
its O
disappearance O
. O
Now O
we O
know O
Miss O
Harcourt B-PERSON
was O
rather O
|
      | O
prejudiced O
against O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
and O
, O
as O
she O
had O
unhappily O
failed O
in O
truth O
more O
than O
once O
( O
perhaps O
|
      | O
she O
was O
not O
so O
unjust O
and O
harsh O
as O
poor O
Ellen B-PERSON
felt O
her O
to O
be O
) O
, O
she O
refused O
to O
believe O
her O
|
      | O
assurance O
that O
she O
had O
written O
it O
. O
No O
one O
had O
been O
in O
the O
school O

room O
at O
the O
time O
to O
whom O
she O

      | O
could O
refer O
: O
if O
Ellen B-PERSON
had O
never O
disobeyed O
or O
deceived O
, O
of O
course O
her O
word O
would O
be O
sufficient O
, O

      | O
as O
her O
brother O

cousins O

would O
. O

" O

failed O
again O

obedience O

your O

certainly O

after O

warn O

Poor O
Ellen O
felt O
too O
bewildered O
and O
too O
miserable O
even O
to O
cry O
. O
That O
she O
had O
written O
her O

      | O
exercise O
, O
she O
was O
as O
positive O
as O
that O
she O
had O
been O
told O
to O
do O
so O
  O
but O
if O
she O
had O
— O
what O
had O
|
      | O
become O
of O
it O
? O
Harsh O
as O
Miss O
Harcourt B-PERSON
seemed O
, O
appearances O
were O
certainly O
very O
much O
against O
her O
. O
|
      | O
She O
had O
not O
a O
single O
proof O
that O
she O
had O
obeyed O
, O
and O
her O
word O
was O
nothing O
  O
even O
Emmeline O
looked O
|
      | O
at O
her O
doubtingly O
, O
and O
as O
if O
she O
could O
scarcely O
even O
pity O
her O
. O
It O
was O
very O
little O
comfort O
to O
|
      | O
think O
her O
aunt O
was O
not O
to O
be O
told O
. O
Her O
own O
impulse O
was O
to O
go O
to O
her O
, O
and O
tell O
her O
at O
once O
  O
but O
|
      | O
how O
could O
she O
be O
believed O
? O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
's O
words—"If O
I O
ever O
discover O
another O
untruth O
, O
you O
|
      | O
will O
compel O
me O
to O
adopt O
still O
severer O
measures O
, O
pain O
as O
it O
will O
be O
to O
myself O
, O
" O
the O
remembrance O
|
      | O
of O
all O
she O
had O
suffered O
, O
the O
disappointment O
it O
would O
be O
to O
her O
aunt O
to O
think O
all O
she O
had O
said O
|
      | O
and O
read O
to O
her O
were O
forgotten O
, O
when O
in O
reality O
she O
was O
constantly O
thinking O
of O
and O
trying O
to O
|
      | O
act O
on O
them O
, O
all O
checked O
the O
impulse O
, O
and O
terrified O
her O
into O
silence O
. O
| 
  | O
Miss O
Harcourt B-PERSON
was O
not O
an O
acute O
physiognomist O
  O
she O
could O
only O
read O
in O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
face O
hardihood O
|
      | O
and O
recklessness O
. O
We O
rather O
think O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
would O
have O
read O
something O
very O
different O
  O
but O
|
      | O
she O
was O
very O
much O
engaged O
with O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
and O
if O
she O
did O
think O
Ellen B-PERSON
looked O
much O
more O
out O
of O
|
      | O
spirits O
, O
she O
attributed O
it O
to O
natural O
feeling O
at O
the O
rapid O
approach O
of O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
of O
separation O
. O
|
      | O
For O
her O
brother O
's O
sake O
, O
to O
prove O
to O
him O
she O
could O
enter O
into O
his O
joy O
, O
she O
tried O
very O
hard O
not O
|
      | O
to O
evince O
the O
least O
symptom O
of O
depression O
, O
and O
never O
to O
cry O
before O
him O
at O
least O
  O
though O
every O
|
      | O
night O
, O
that O
told O
her O
another B-DATE
day I-DATE
had O
gone O
, O
and O
brought O
before O
her O
all O
sorts O
of O
vague O
feelings O
|
      | O
and O
fancies O
of O
dread O
, O
she O
either O
cried O
herself O
to O
sleep O
, O
or O
laid O
awake O
, O
still O
more O
unhappy O
. O
|
      | O
The O
suspicion O
attached O
to O
her O
seemed O
to O
double O
the O
severity O
of O
the O
trial O
of O
parting O
. O
Edward B-PERSON
|
      | O
was O
her O
own O
  O
Edward B-PERSON
must O
love O
her O
, O
with O
all O
her O
faults O
  O
but O
even O
her O
aunt O
, O
her O
kind O
, O
dear O
, O
|
      | O
good O
aunt O
, O
must O
cease O
to O
have O
any O
affection O
for O
her O
, O
if O
so O
constantly O
believed O
guilty O
of O
a O
sin O
|
      | O
so O
terrible O
as O
falsehood O
. O
And O
she O
seemed O
to O
love O
her O
brother O
still O
more O
than O
ever O
, O
every O
day O
|
      | O
that O
brought O
the B-TIME
hour I-TIME
of O
parting O
nearer O
— O
sometimes O
as O
if O
she O
|  | O
could O
not O
|  | O
bear O
the O
pain O
|
      | O
of O
not O
being O
able O
to O
look O
at O
his O
bright O
face O
, O
and O
listen O
to O
his O
glad O
laugh O
and O
dear O
voice O
for O
|
      | O
three B-CARDINAL
, O
perhaps O
six B-DATE
long I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O
Her O
aunt O
's O
gentle O
kindness O
seemed O
to O
increase O
her O
unhappiness O
, O
|
      | O
for O
though O
she O
knew O
she O
was O
innocent O
, O
still O
she O
felt O
, O
if O
Miss O
Harcourt B-PERSON
had O
told O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
|
      | O
she O
could O
not O
be O
so O
caressed O
and O
cared O
for O
and O
she O
was O
receiving O
that O
which O
she O
was O
believed O
|
      | O
to O
have O
forfeited O
. O
Miss O
Harcourt B-PERSON
's O
face O
certainly O
seemed O
to O
ask O
her O
as O
distinctly O
as O
words O
, O
|
      | O
how O
she O
could O
be O
so O
artful O
— O
so O
deceitful O
— O
as O
to O
permit O
her O
aunt O
to O
take O
such O
notice O
of O
her O
  O
and O
|
      | O
so O
she O
often O
shrunk O
away O
, O
when O
she O
most O
longed O
to O
sit O
by O
and O
listen O
to O
her O
. O
| 
  | O
Edward B-PERSON
's O
spirits O
never O
sobered O
, O
except O
now O
and O
then O
, O
when O
he O
thought O
of O
leaving O
Mrs. O
|
      | O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
to O
whom O
he O
had O
given O
the O
same O
love O
he O
had O
lavished O
on O
his O
mother O
, O
perhaps O
to O
a O
still O
|
      | O
greater O
extent O
, O
for O
reverence O
was O
largely O
mingled O
with O
it O
. O
Mr O
Howard B-PERSON
, O
too O
, O
was O
another O
whom O
he O
|
      | O
grieved O
to O
leave O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
so O
trusted O
in O
these O
apparently O
strong O
affections O
and O
his O
|
      | O
good O
disposition O
, O
as O
to O
feel O
but O
little O
anxiety O
  O
merely O
sorrow O
that O
she O
was O
to O
lose O
him O
for O
a O
|
      | O
profession O
of O
danger O
. O
She O
did O
not O
know O
, O
nor O
did O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
, O
nor O
Edward B-PERSON
himself O
, O
that O
he O
was O
|
      | O
one O
who O
would O
be O
guided O
more O
by O
the O
influence O
of O
those O
with O
whom O
he O
was O
intimately O
thrown O
, O

      | O
than O
by O
any O
memory O
of O
the O
absent O

or O
judgment O

his O
own O

Ellen B-PERSON

manner O
on O
Monday B-DATE

still O
more O

Mary B-PERSON

Mr. O

Howard B-PERSON

and O
some O
of O
Edward B-PERSON

all O
assembled O
at O
Oakwood B-ORG

every O
one O
was O

      | O
determined O
to O
be O
gay O

cheerful O

and O
Edward B-PERSON

voice O
was O
the O
merriest O
, O

his O
laugh O
the O

      | O
happiest O
there O
  O
and O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
though O
her O
head O
ached O

the O
constant O
struggle O
of O

      | O
the B-DATE
preceding I-DATE
week I-DATE
, O
was O
quite O
cheerful O

talked O

Lilla B-PERSON

Cecil O

Grahame O

and O
even O
to O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
, O
as O
Miss O
Harcourt B-PERSON
felt O
she O
had O
no O
right O
to O
do O
  O
and O
as O
must O

      | O
prove O
her O
to O
be O
that O
which O
she O
had O
always O
fancied O
her O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
saw O
|
      | O
that O
in O
the O
very O
midst O
of O
a O
laugh O
, O
or O
of O
speaking O
, O
her O
niece O

eye O
would O
rest O
upon O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
and O

      | O
the O
lip O
quite O
quiver O
, O
and O
her O
smile O
become O
for O
the O
moment O
so O
strained O
, O
that O
she O
was O
satisfied O
|
      | O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
cheerfulness O
proceeded O
from O
no O
want O
of O
feeling O
  O
she O
wondered O
, O
indeed O
, O
at O
so O
much O
|
      | O
control O
at O
such O
an O
early O
age O
, O
but O
she O
loved O
her O
for O
it O
, O
notwithstanding O
. O
Once O
only O
Ellen B-PERSON
was O
|
      | O
nearly O
conquered O
. O
Mary B-PERSON
had O
begged O
her O
to O
sing O
a O
little O
Hindoo B-PERSON
air O
, O
of O
which O
she O
was O
|
      | O
particularly O
fond O
, O
and O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
hearing O
the O
request O
, O
said O
eagerly O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
Do O
sing O
it O
, O
dear O
Ellen B-PERSON
  O
I O
am O
quite O
as O
fond O
of O
it O
as O
Mary B-PERSON
is O
, O
for O
it O
seems O
to O
make O
me O
think O
|
      | O
of O
India B-GPE
and O
poor O
mamma O
, O
and O
it O
will O
be O
such O
a O
long O
time O
before O
I O
hear O
it O
again O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
She O
had O
never O
in O
her O
whole O
life O
felt O
so O
disinclined O
to O
sing O
, O
so O
as O
if O
it O
were O
quite O
|
      | O
impossible O
— O
as O
if O
she O
must O
cry O
if O
she O
did O
  O
but O
Edward B-PERSON
would O
think O
it O
so O
unkind O
if O
she O
refused O
, O
|
      | O
for O
she O
did O
not O
know O
herself O
why O
his O
very O
words O
should O
have O
increased O
the O
difficulty O
, O
and O
what O
|
      | O
reason O
could O
she O
give O
him O
? O
Mary B-PERSON
went O
and O
asked O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
to O
accompany O
her O
  O
and O
Ellen B-PERSON
did O
|
      | O
her O
very O
best O
, O
but O
her O
voice O
would O
tremble O
, O
and O
just O
before O
the B-DATE
end I-DATE
of I-DATE
the I-DATE
second B-ORDINAL
verse O
it O
|
      | O
failed O
entirely O
  O
but O
still O
she O
was O
glad O
she O
had O
tried O

for O
on O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
saying O
, O
very O

      | O
kindly O
, O
and O
in O
a O
voice O
that O
only O
she O
and O
Mary B-PERSON
could O
hear O
, O
" O
I O
was O
half B-CARDINAL
afraid O

night O

my O
dear O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
but O
you O
were O
quite O
right O
to O
try O

" O
Mary B-PERSON
seemed O
to O
understand O
|
      | O
at O
once O
why O
it O
had O
been O
so O
difficult O
for O
her O
to O
oblige O
her O
, O
and O
to O
be O
quite O
sorry O
she O
had O

      | O
pressed O
it O
so O
much O
, O
and O
Edward B-PERSON
had O
thanked O
her O
, O

told O
her O
he O
should O
sing O
it O
in O
idea O
very O

      | O
often O

tried O

be O
merry O
again O
, O
but O
she O
could O
not O
succeed O
as O
before O

so O
she O
kept O
as O

      | O
near O
her O
aunt O
as O
she O
could O
, O
all O
the O

the B-TIME

Edward B-PERSON

had O
a O
hard O
battle O
with O
himself O

as O
one O
by O
one B-CARDINAL

eager O
— O
but O
in O
some O
, O
half B-CARDINAL
- O
choked O
wishes O
for O
|
      | O
his O
health O
and O
prosperity O
  O
and O
when O
all O
had O
gone O
, O
and O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
remained O
for O
|
      | O
prayers O
, O
took O
him O
in O
his O
arms O
, O
and O
solemnly O
prayed O
God O
to O
bless O
him O
, O
and O
save O
him O
from O
danger O
|
      | O
and O
temptation O
, O
and O
permit O
him O
to O
return O
to O
his O
family O
, O
improved O
in O
all O
things O
that O
would O
make O
|
      | O
him O
an O
affectionate O
guardian O
to O
his O
orphan O
sister O
, O
and O
repay O
all O
the O
love O
and O
care O
of O
his O
aunt O
|
      | O
and O
uncle O
, O
it O
was O
a O
desperate O
effort O
that O
prevented O
him O
from O
sobbing O
like O
a O
child O
  O
but O
he O
had O
|
      | O
his O
midshipman O
's O
uniform O
on O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
, O
and O
he O
was O
quite O
resolved O
he O
would O
not O
|
      | O
disgrace O
it O
  O
therefore O
he O
only O
returned O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
's O
embrace O
very O
warmly O
, O
and O
ran O
out O
of O
the O
|
      | O
room O
. O
But O
when O
his O
aunt O
went O
into O
his O
room O
an O
hour O
afterward O
, O
it O
appeared O
as O
if O
he O
had O
put O
off O
|
      | O
his O
pride O
and O
his O
uniform O
together O
, O
for O
, O
though O
he O
was O
fast O
asleep O
, O
his O
pillow O
was O
quite O
wet O
|
      | O
with O
tears O
. O
| 
  | O
The B-TIME
next I-TIME
morning I-TIME
was O
a O
very O
sad O
one O
, O
though O
Percy B-PERSON
and O
his O
father O
did O
all O
they O
could O
to O
make O
|
      | O
it O
cheerful O
( O
we O
ought O
to O
have O
said O
before O
that O
Percy B-PERSON
and O
Herbert B-PERSON
were O
both O
going O
with O
Mr. O
|
      | O
Hamilton B-PERSON
and O
Edward B-PERSON
) O
. O
No O
one O
liked O
the O
idea O
of O
losing O
Edward B-PERSON
for O
so O
long O
a O
time O
. O
He O
had O
made O
|
      | O
himself O
a O
favorite O
with O
all O
, O
even O
with O
every O
one O
of O
the O
servants O
, O
who O
, O
when O
the O
carriage O
was O
|
      | O
ready O
at O
eleven B-TIME
o'clock I-TIME
, O
thronged O
into O
the O
hall O
to O
take O
a O
last O
look O
at O
him O
. O
He O
was O
so O
altered O
, O
|
      | O
that O
he O
had O
that B-TIME
morning I-TIME
, O
actually O
of O
his O
own O
accord O
, O
shaken O
hands O
with O
every O
one O
of O
them O
who O
|
      | O
had O
ever O
done O
any O
thing O
for O
him O
, O
especially O
Ellis B-GPE
and O
Morris B-PERSON
, O
and O
Robert B-PERSON
, O
to O
whom O
he O
had O
given O
|
      | O
a O
very O
handsome O
present O
, O
and O
thanked O
him O
for O
all O
his O
attention O
. O
| 
  | O
He O
kept O
up O
very O
manfully O
till O
he O
came O
to O
his O
aunt O
, O
whose O
emotion O
, O
as O
she O
held O
him O
in O
a O
close O
|
      | O
embrace O
, O
was O
so O
unusually O
visible O
, O
and O
for O
the O
moment O
he O
seemed O
so O
to O
love O
her O
, O
that O
the O
idea O
|
      | O
of O
the O
sea O
lost O
half B-CARDINAL
its O
delight O
, O
and O
he O
felt O
as O
if O
he O
could O
almost O
have O
liked O
to O
remain O
with O
|
      | O
her O
. O
But O
Percy B-PERSON
's O
joyous O
voice O
— O

  | O
" O
Come B-WORK_OF_ART
, I-WORK_OF_ART
Master I-WORK_OF_ART

you O
were O
a O

not O
a O

boy O

Off O
with O
you O
  O
you O
will O

      | O
not O
give O
me O
time O
or O
room O
for O
one B-CARDINAL
kiss O
from O
mamma O
before O
we O
go O
, O
" O
roused O
him O
, O
and O
he O
tried O
to O
|
      | O
laugh O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
his O
tears O
, O
gave O
Ellen B-PERSON
another O
kiss O
, O
and O
ran O
into O
the O
carriage O
, O
where O
he O
|
      | O
was O
quickly O
followed O
by O
his O
uncle O
and O
cousins O
, O
and O
in O
a B-TIME
very I-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
Oakwood O
, O
dear O
, O
happy O
|
      | O
Oakwood B-ORG
, O
as O
his O
whole O
heart O
felt O
it O
at O
that O
moment O
, O
was O
hidden O
from O
his O
sight O
. O
| 
  | O
Ellen B-PERSON
remained O
by O
the O
window O
, O
looking O
after O
the O
carriage O
, O
long O
after O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
|
      | O
see O
or O
hear O
it O
, O
very O
pale O
, O
and O
her O
eyes O
very O
heavy O
, O
but O
not O
in O
tears O
  O
and O
as O
her O
aunt O
went O
to O
|
      | O
her O
, O
and O
put O
her O
arm O
round O
her O
, O
and O
began O
talking O
to O
her O
very O
cheerfully O
of O
all O
Edward B-PERSON
would O
|
      | O
have O
to O
write O
to O
her O
about O
, O
and O
how O
soon O
they O
might O
hear O
from O
him O
, O
and O
that O
Ellen B-PERSON
should O
|
      | O
answer O
him O
as O
often O
and O
as O
fully O
as O
she O
liked O
, O
and O
that O
she O
would O
not O
even O
ask O
to O
see O
her O
|
      | O
letters O
to O
him O
, O
or O
all O
his O
to O
her O
, O
as O
they O
might O
have O
many O
little O
affectionate O
things O
to O
say O
|
      | O
to O
each O
other O
, O
that O
they O
might O
not O
care O
about O
any O
one O
else O
seeing O
, O
and O
she O
would O
trust O
them O
|
      | O
both O
— O
Ellen O
seemed O
as O
if O
one O
pain O
was O
soothed O
, O
and O
if O
indeed O
she O
heard O
often O
from O
him O
, O
she O
|
      | O
might O
bear O
his O
departure O
. O
But O
there O
was O
still O
the O
other O
source O
of O
unhappiness O
, O
recalled O
every O
|
      | O
time O
she O
met O
Miss O
Harcourt B-GPE
's O
cold O
suspicious O
look O
, O
which O
had O
not O
changed O
even O
then O
. O
Still O
she O
|
      | O
tried O
to O
join O
her O
cousins O
, O
and O
get O
her O
work O
, O
for O
there O
were O
no O
studies O
that O
morning O
, O
and O
so O
|
      | O
some O
little O
time O
passed O
, O
by O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
's O
exertions O
, O
almost O
cheerfully O
  O
but O
then O
Ellen B-PERSON
left O
|
      | O
the O
room O
to O
get O
something O
she O
wanted O
, O
and O
, O
in O
seeking O
her O
own O
, O
passed O
Edward B-PERSON
's O
room O
, O
the O
door O
|
      | O
of O
which O
stood O
half O
open O
. O
She O
could O
not O
resist O
entering O
, O
and O
every O
thing O
spoke O
of O
him O
so O
|
      | O
vividly O
, O
and O
yet O
seemed O
so O
to O
tell O
her O
he O
had O
gone O
, O
really O
gone O
, O
and O
she O
was O
quite O
alone O
, O
that O
|
      | O
all O
the O
pain O
came O
back O
again O
worse O
than O
ever O
, O
and O
she O
laid O
her O
head O
on O
his O
pillow O
, O
and O
her O
|
      | O
long O
- O
checked O
tears O
flowed O
with O
almost O
passionate O
violence O
. O

  | O
" O
My O

I O
have O
been O
looking O

said O
her O

kind O
voice O

full O

an B-TIME
hour I-TIME

Emmeline O
went O
into O
your O

I O
could O
not O

      | O
imagine O
what O
had O
become O
of O
you O

It O

think O

that O

will O
be O
happier O

would O

I O
know O
you O
must O
miss O
him O
very O

very O
painfully O

you O
will O
be O

no O

you O
can O
fancy O
how O
dreadful O
it O
would O
be O

check O
her O
tears O

almost O
alarmed O

Ellen B-PERSON
could O

much O

waiting O
several B-TIME

Ellen B-PERSON
tried O
to O
obey O
, O
but O
her O
grief O
had O
gained O
such O
an O
ascendency O
, O
that O
it O
was O
very O
|
      | O
difficult O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
looked O
very O
thoughtful O
when O
she O
ceased O
, O
for O
she O
really O
was O
more O
|
      | O
perplexed O
than O
she O
allowed O
Ellen B-PERSON
to O
perceive O
  O
and O
the O
poor O
child O
, O
fancying O
her O
silence O
could O
|
      | O
only O
mean O
disbelief O
and O
condemnation O
, O
remained O
quiet O
and O
trembling O
by O
her O
side O
. O

  | O
" O
I O
promised O
you O
that O
I O
would O
not O
doubt O
you O

Ellen B-PERSON

I O
will O
not O
now O
, O
though O
appearances O

      | O
are O
so O
strong O
against O
you O
, O
" O
she O
said O
, O
after O
several B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
' I-TIME
thought O
. O
" O
Come O
with O
me O

find O
some O

explain O
this O

      | O
mystery O

" O
| 
  | O
Ellen B-PERSON
thought O
that O
was O
quite O
impossible O
  O
but O
, O
inexpressibly O
comforted O
by O
her O
aunt O

trust O
, O

she O
went O
with O
her O
directly O
. O

" O
Ellen B-PERSON

been O
telling O
me O

, O
my O
dear O
Lucy B-PERSON

" O

      | O
Mrs. O

said O
, O
directly O

entered O
, O
addressing O
Miss O
Harcourt B-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
sitting O
reading O

      | O
with O
Caroline B-ORG

Emmeline I-ORG
, O
" O
and O
certainly O
with O
great O
apparent O
justice O
  O
but O
she O
is O
so O
unhappy O

      | O
about O
it O
, O
that O
I O
can O
scarcely O
believe O
that O
she O
has O
forgotten O
all O
which O
passed O
between O
us O
a O

      | O
short O
time O
ago O
, O

I O
am O
going O

, O
with O
your O
permission O
, O
to O
try O
if O
I O
can O
not O
discover O

      | O
something O
that O
may O
throw O
a O
light O
on O
the O
subject O

  | O
" O
I O
am O
afraid O
that O
will O
scarcely O
be O
possible O

replied O
Miss O
Harcourt B-PERSON
  O
" O
however O
, O
I O
am O
glad O
she O

      | O
has O
had O
the O
candor O
to O
tell O

      | O
the B-DATE

" O
Ellen B-PERSON
had O
brought O
her O
book O

Miss O
Harcourt B-PERSON
was O
speaking O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON

      | O
attentively O
examined O
it O

you O
not O

the O

      | O
with O

did O
not O
come O
from O
Exeter B-PRODUCT
as O
soon O
as O
we O
expected O
. O
And O
we O
noticed O
how O
much O
|
      | O
thinner O
they O
were O
, O
though O
they O
were O
the O

books O

" O

did O
I O
not O

something O
about O
their O
having O
the O

number O
of O
leaves O
, O
and O
|
      | O
therefore O
it O
must O
have O
been O
only O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
paper O

made O
the O
difference O
? O

" O
What O
a O
memory O
you O
have O

answered O
Caroline B-PERSON
, O
smiling O
. O
" O
I O

very O
often O

in O
a O
moment O

with O
her O
usual O
quickness O
of O
movement O
, O
Caroline B-PERSON
unlocked O
her O
desk O

drew O
forth O

      | O
her O
book O

ran O
over O
the O

" O

, O
by O
some O
incomprehensible O

two B-CARDINAL

depended O
so O
much O

      | O
on O
my O
going O
out O

soon O

away O

writing O
, O
my O
dear O
Lucy B-PERSON
  O
we O
can O
have O
no O

      | O
more O
doubt O
now O
, O
" O
said O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
the O
moment O
Fanny B-ORG
had O
left O
the O
room O
, O
delighted O
with O
the O
|
      | O
exchange O
, O
and O
drawing O
Ellen B-PERSON
close O
to O
her O
, O
for O
the O
poor O
child O
could O
really O
scarcely O
stand O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
have O
done O
you O
injustice O
, O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
and O
I O
beg O
your O
pardon O
, O
" O
replied O
Miss O
Harcourt B-GPE
directly O
, O
|
      | O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
would O
have O
been O
better O
pleased O
had O
she O
stopped O
there O
, O
but O
she O
could O
not O
help O
|
      | O
adding O
, O
" O
You O
know O
I O
should O
never O
have O
doubted O
you O
, O
if O
you O
had O
not O
so O
often O
forfeited O

      | O
truth O

" O
| 
  | O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
first B-ORDINAL
impulse O
had O
been O
to O
go O
to O
her O
, O
but O
her O
last O
words O
caused O
her O
to O
bury O
her O
face O
|
      | O
on O
her O
aunt O
's O
shoulder O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
really O
think O
, O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
you O
ought O
to O
thank O
Ellis B-PERSON
for O
giving O
Fanny B-ORG
a O
scolding O
, O
as O
it O
has O
done O

      | O
you O
such O
excellent O
service O

resumed O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
playfully O
  O
" O
and O
what O
fee O
are O
you O
going O
to O

      | O
give O
me O
for O
taking O
upon O
myself O
to O
prove O
your O
innocence O

I O
think O
myself O
so O
very O

      | O
clever O

that O
I O
shall O
tell O
Percy B-PERSON
I O
am O
a O
better O
lawyer O
without O

than O
he O
can O
hope O
to O
be O

      | O
with O

You O
do O
n't O
seem O
very O
capable O
of O
doing O
any O
thing O

kissing O
me O
now O
, O

so O
I O
will O
not O
be O

      | O
very O
exacting O
. O
You O
have O
cried O
yourself O
almost O
ill O

so O
must O
bear O
the O
penalty O

lie O

down O

  | O
Emmeline O

quite O
proud O
of O
the O

more O

left O
the O

Caroline O
seemed O
to O
hesitate O
for O
a O
moment O
, O

      | O

she O
was O
quite O
certain O
by O
her O

that O
she O
wished O
to O
speak O
with O
Miss O
Harcourt B-PERSON
, O

      | O
and O
so O
, O
without O
being O
told O
, O
took O
up O
her O
book O
, O
and O
went O
into O
the O
library O
. O

  | O
" O

again O

" O
was O
her O
instant O
reply O
  O
" O
you O
have O

      | O
every O
right O
to O

it O

was O

      | O
too O
prejudiced O

hasty O

your O
own O

are O
so O
truthful O
, O
so O
open O
, O
that O
I O
fear O

      | O
they O
have O
quite O
spoiled O
me O
for O
the O
necessary O
patience O

forbearance O
with O
others O

" O

  | O
" O
You O
have O
not O
quite O
guessed O
it O
, O
Lucy B-PERSON
. O
Appearances O
were O
so O
very O
strongly O
against O
that O
poor O

      | O
child O
, O
that O
I O
am O
not O
at O
all O
astonished O
you O
should O
have O
disbelieved O
her O
assertion O
. O
In O
the O
|
      | O
moment O
of O
irritation O
, O
it O
is O
not O
unlikely O
I O
should O
have O
done O
so O
myself O
  O
but O
the O
favor O
I O
am O
|
      | O
going O
to O
ask O
you O
, O
is O
merely O
that O
you O
will O
try O
and O

never O
show O
|  | O
that O
you O
doubt O
her O
word O
, O

      | O
or O
refer O
to O
her O
past O
failures O
. O
I O
am O
quite O
convinced O
that O
untruth O
is O
not O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
natural O
|
      | O
disposition O
, O
but O
that O
it O
has O
been O
caused O
by O
the O
same O
circumstances O
which O
have O
made O
her O
such O
a O

      | O
painfully O
timid O

too O
humble O
character O

with O
all O
her O
efforts O

certain O

very O
natural O
question O

The B-DATE

passed O
much O

the O
morning O

Emmeline B-ORG

nursing O

      | O
was O
so O
affectionate O
and O
successful O
, O
that O
Ellen B-PERSON
was O
quite O
able O
to O
join O
them O
at O
dinner O
, O
and O
her O
|
      | O
aunt O
had O
selected O
such O
a O
very O
interesting O
story O
to O
read O
aloud O
, O
in O
which O
one O
character O
was O
a O
|
      | O
young O
sailor O
, O
that O
the B-TIME
hours I-TIME
seemed O
to O
fly O
  O
and O
then O
they O
had O
a O
long O
talk O
about O
poor O
Alice B-PERSON

      | O
Seaton B-GPE
and O
her O
brother O
, O
whether O
it O
would O
be O
possible O
for O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
to O
place O
young O
Seaton B-PERSON
in O

      | O
a O
situation O
that O
he O
liked O
better O
, O
and O
that O
his O
health O
was O
more O
fitted O

Ellen B-PERSON
said O
she O

      | O
should O
like O
to O
see O
and O
know O
Alice B-PERSON
so O
much O
, O
for O
her O
trial O
must O
be O
such O
a O
very O
hard O
one O
, O
that O
|
      | O
her O
aunt O
promised O
her O
she O
should O
in O
the B-DATE
midsummer I-DATE
holidays I-DATE
, O
for O
Alice B-PERSON
should O

come O

      | O
spend O
a B-DATE

      | O
him O
, O
brought O
back O
some O
of O
the O
pain O
again O
  O

she O
found O
that O
thinking O
about O
poor O
Alice B-PERSON

      | O
fancying O
how O

made O
her O
pain O

seem O
less O

  O
as O
if O
to O

Over O
this O
interval O
, O
however O
, O
much O
as O
we O
are O
anxious O
to O
proceed O
, O
we O
must O
take O
a O
brief O
glance O
, O
|
      | O
clearly O
to O
understand O
the O
aspect O
of O
the O
Oakwood B-ORG
home O

, O
which O
, O
from O
the O
increasing O
age O

      | O
of O
the O
younger O
members O
, O
had O
undergone O
some O
slight O
change O
. O
The O
greatest O
and O
most O
keenly O
felt O
|
      | O
was O
the O
departure O
of O
Percy B-PERSON
and O
Herbert B-PERSON
for O
college O
, O
the B-DATE
October I-DATE
twelvemonth I-DATE
after O
Edward B-PERSON
had O
|
      | O
gone O
  O
the O
house O
seemed O
actually O
desolate O
without O
them O
. O
Percy B-PERSON

wild O
jokes O
and O
inexhaustible O

      | O
spirits O
, O
and O
Herbert B-PERSON
's O
quiet O
, O
unobtrusive O
kindness O
, O
much O
as O
they O
had O
always O
been O
truly O
|
      | O
appreciated O
by O
their O
home O
circle O
, O
still O
scarcely O
seemed O
to O
have O
been O
fully O
felt O
till O
the O
young O
|
      | O
men O
were O
gone O
  O
and O
the O
old O
house O
actually O
seemed O
enwrapped O
in O
a O
silence O
, O
which O
it O
required O
|
      | O
very O
determined O
effort O
on O
the O
part O
of O
all O
who O
remained O
in O
the O
least O
degree O
to O
dispel O

  | O
Our O
readers O
who O
are O
mothers O
, O
and O
earnest O
ones O
, O
will O
easily O
understand O
the O
anxious O
tremblings O
|
      | O
of O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
's O
heart O
, O
when O
she O
parted O
from O
her O
boys O
for O
the O
world O
: O
for O
such O
, O
to O
spirits O

      | O
fresh O
, O
boyish O
, O
unsophisticated O
, O
as O
they O
still O
were O
, O
Oxford B-ORG
could O
not O
fail O
to O
be O
. O
For O
Herbert B-PERSON
, O
|
      | O
indeed O
, O
she O
had O
neither O
fear O
nor O
doubt O
: O
no O
sneer O
, O
no O
temptation O
, O
no O
bad O
example O
, O
would O
affect O
|
      | O
him O
, O
in O
whom O
every O
passing O
year O
seemed O
to O
increase O
and O
deepen O
those O
exalted O
feelings O
which O
, O
in O
|
      | O
his O
earliest O
childhood O
, O
had O
" O
less O
in O
them O
of O
earth B-LOC
than O
heaven O
. O
" O
His O
piety O
was O
so O
real O
, O
his O
|
      | O
faith O
so O
fervent O
, O
his O
affections O
so O
concentrated O
in O
his O
home O
and O
in O
one B-CARDINAL
other O
individual O
, O
his O
|
      | O
love O
and O
pursuit O
of O
study O
so O
ardent O
and O
unceasing O
, O
his O
one O
aim O
, O
to O
become O
worthy O
in O
heart O
and O
|
      | O
mind O
to O
serve O
God O
as O
his O
minister O
, O
so O
ever O
present O
, O
that O
he O
was O
effectually O
guarded O
even O
from O
|
      | O
the O
world O
. O
Percy B-PERSON
had O
none O
of O
these O
feelings O
to O
the O
same O
extent O
, O
save O
his O
ardent O
love O
for O
home O
|
      | O
and O
its O
inmates O
— O
his O
mother O
, O
above O
all O
. O
He O
did O
, O
indeed O
, O
give O
every O
promise O
that O
the O
principles O
|
      | O
so O
carefully O
instilled O
had O
taken O
firm O
root O
, O
and O
would O
guide O
his O
conduct O
in O
the O
world O
  O
but O
Mrs. O
|
      | O
Hamilton B-PERSON
was O
too O
humble O
- O
minded O
— O
too O
convinced O
that O
every O
human O
effort O
is O
imperfect O
, O
without O
the O
|
      | O
sustaining O
and O
vitalizing O
grace O
of O
God O
, O
to O
rest O
in O
security O
, O
as O
many O
might O
have O
done O
, O
that O
|
        | O
because O
|  | O
she O
had O
so O
worked O
, O
so O
prayed O
, O
she O
|  | O
must O
|  | O
succeed O
. O
She O
was O
hopeful O
, O
|
      | O
indeed O
, O
very O
hopeful O
— O
how O
could O
she O
be O
otherwise O
when O
she O
beheld O
his O
deep O
, O
though O
silent O
, O
|
      | O
reverence O
for O
sacred O
things O
— O
his O
constant O
and O
increasing O
respect O
and O
love O
for O
his O
father O
— O
his O
|
      | O
devoted O
affection O
for O
herself O
— O
his O
attachment O
to O
Herbert B-PERSON
, O
which O
seemed O
so O
strangely O
yet O
so O
|
      | O
beautifully O
to O
combine O
almost O
reverence O
for O
his O
superior O
mind O
and O
holier O
spirit O
, O
with O
the O
|
      | O
caressing O
protectiveness O
of O
an O
older O
for O
a O
younger O
— O
a O
stronger O
for O
a O
weaker O
? O
There O
was O
much O
in O
|
      | O
all O
this O
to O
banish O
anxiety O
altogether O
, O
but O
not O
from O
such O
a O
heart O
as O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
's O
, O
whose O
|
      | O
very O
multiplicity O
of O
blessings O
made O
her O
often O
tremble O
, O
and O
led O
her O
to O
the O
footstool O
of O
her O
|
      | O
God O
, O
with O
a O
piety O
as O
humble O
, O
as O
constant O
, O
as O
fervent O
, O
as O
many O
believe O
is O
the O
fruit O
of O
|
      | O
adversity O
alone O
. O
| 
  | O
Caroline B-PERSON
had O
sufficiently O
improved O
as O
greatly O
to O
decrease O
solicitude O
on O
her O
account O
: O
though O
|
      | O
there O
was O
still O
a O
want O
of O
sufficient O
humility O
, O
a O
too O
great O
proneness O
to O
trust O
implicitly O
in O
|
      | O
her O
own O
strength O
, O
an O
inclination O
to O
prejudice O
, O
and O
a O
love O
of O
admiration O
, O
which O
all O
made O
Mrs. O

      | O
Hamilton B-PERSON

would O
expose O
her O
to O
some O
personal O

were O
entirely O
overcome O
. O
To O

      | O
produce O
eternal O
good O
, O
she O
might O
not O
murmur O
at O
temporal O
suffering O
  O
but O
her O
fond O
heart O
, O
though O
|
      | O
it O
could O
anticipate O
it O
calmly O
for O
herself O
, O
so O
shrunk O
from O
it O
, O
as O
touching O
her O
child O
, O
that O
the O

      | O
nearer O
approached O
the O
period O
of O
Caroline B-GPE

introduction O
to O

gay O
world O
, O
the O
more O
painfully O

      | O
anxious O
she O
became O
, O
and O
the O
more O
gladly O
would O
she O
have O
retained O
her O
in O
the O
retirement O
of O

Oakwood B-ORG
, O
where O
all O
her O
better O

But O
she O
knew O

she O
could O
only O

To O
her O

it O

Mrs. O

judicious O
care O

so O
taught O
that O

        | O
Truth O

was O
poetry O

its O

was O
the O

Real O
— O
that O
she O
was O
neither O
romantic O

Keen O

her O

were O
, O
even O
over O
a O

For O
miles B-CARDINAL
round O
her O
father O

large O

she O
was O
known O
, O
loved O

so O
felt O
as O
a O
guardian O

      | O
spirit O
, O
that O
the O
very O
sound O
of O
her O
step O
seemed O
to O
promise O
joy O

She O
actually O
seemed O

live O
for O

others O

making O
their O
pleasures O

so O

at O

Before O

      | O
indeed O

she O
would O

  O
though O
even O
then O
natural O
kindliness O

prompted O
such O

he O
jestingly O

      | O
wrote O
to O
his O
aunt O

must O
certainly O
be O
the O
very O
best O
friend O
he O
could O
have O
chosen O

as O

      | O
he O
was O
much O
too O
old O
to O
lead O
him O
into O
mischief O

Why O
he O
( O
Harding B-PERSON

had O
taken O
such O
a O
fancy O
to O
him O
, O

      | O
Edward B-PERSON
could O
not O
tell O
  O
but O
he O
was O
so O
excessively O
kind O
, O
so O
taught O
him O
his O
duty O
, O
and O
smoothed O
|
      | O
all O
the O
difficulties O
and O
disagreeables O
which O
, O
he O
owned O
, O
had O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
seemed O
overwhelming O
, O
that O
|
      | O
he O
never O
could O
be O
grateful O
enough O
. O
He O
added O
, O
that O
, O
though O
not O
a O
general O
favorite O
with O
his O

      | O
immediate O
messmates O

he O
was O

his O
other O
superior O

which O
Edward B-PERSON
was O

It O
was O
very O
easy O
to O
perceive O
that O
young O
Fortescue B-ORG

susceptible O

      | O
affections O
had O
all O
been O
not O

alarmed O
her O

to O

that O
this B-PERSON
Gilbert I-PERSON
Harding I-PERSON
, O

      | O
though O
very O
young O
at O
the O
time O
had O
been O
one O
of O
the O
principal O
actors O
in O
the O
affair O
which O
had O
|
      | O
caused O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
to O
dismiss O
his O
pupils O
, O
as O
we O
related O
in O
a O
former O
page O
  O
that O
his O
very O
youth O
, O
|
      | O
for O
he O
could O
scarcely O
have O
been O
more B-TIME
than I-TIME
eleven I-TIME
or I-TIME
twelve B-CARDINAL
, O
and O
determined O
hardihood O
, O
so O
|
      | O
marked O
natural O
depravity O
, O
that O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
had O
had O
less O
hope O
for O
him O
than O
for O
any O
of O
the O
|
      | O
others O
. O
This O
opinion O
had O
been O
borne O
out O
by O
his O
after O
conduct O
at O
home O
  O
but O
the O
affair O
had O
been O
|
      | O
successfully O
hushed O
up O
by O
his O
family O
  O
and O
by O
immense O
interest O
he O
been O
permitted O
to O
enter O
the O
|
      | O
navy O
, O
where O
, O
it O
was O
said O
, O
his O
youthful O
errors O
had O
been O
so O
redeemed O
, O
and O
his O
courage O
and O
|
      | O
conduct O
altogether O
had O
so O
won O
him O
applause O
, O
that O
no O
farther O
fears O
were O
entertained O
for O
him O
. O
|
      | O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
alone O
retained O
his O
opinion O
, O
that O
the O
disposition O
was O
naturally O
bad O
, O
and O
doubted O
the O
|
        | O
internal O
|  | O
response O
to O
the O
seeming O
|  | O
outward O
good O
| | O
  O
and O
he O
was O
grieved O
and O
|
      | O
anxious O
beyond O
measure O
, O
when O
he O
heard O
that O
he O
was O
not O
only O
on O
board O
the O
same O
ship O
as O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
|
      | O
but O
already O
his O
favorite O
companion O
and O
most O
trusted O
friend O
. O
His O
anxiety O
, O
of O
course O
, O
extended O
|
      | O
itself O
to O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
to O
such O
a O
degree O
, O
that O
at O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
moment O
they O
would O
gladly O
|
      | O
have O
endeavored O
to O
exchange O
his O
ship O
  O
but O
this O
would O
have O
seemed O
very O
strange O
to O
Sir O
Edward B-PERSON
|
      | O
Manly B-ORG
, O
who O
was O
one O
of O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
's O
most O
valued O
friends O
. O
He O
had O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
actually O
delayed O
|
      | O
Edward B-PERSON
's O
becoming O
a O
midshipman O
till O
Sir O
Edward B-PERSON
could O
take O
him O
in O
his O
own O
ship O
and O
now O
to O
place O
|
      | O
him O
elsewhere O
was O
really O
impossible O
  O
and O
, O
after O
all O
, O
though O
he O
might O
be O
removed O
from O
Harding B-PERSON
's O
|
      | O
influence O
, O
how O
could O
his O
anxious O
guardians O
know O
all O
with O
whom O
he O
might O
be O
thrown O
? O
They O
were O
|
      | O
obliged O
to O
content O
themselves O
with O
writing O
earnestly O
and O
affectionately O
to O
Edward B-PERSON
  O
and O
, O
|
      | O
painful O
as O
it O
was O
, O
to O
throw O
a O
doubt O
and O
shade O
over O
such O
youthful O
confidence O
and O
affection O
, O
|
      | O
implored O
him O
not O
to O
trust O
too O
implicitly O
in O
Harding B-GPE
  O
that O
his O
character O
had O
not O
always O
been O
|
      | O
free O
from O
stain O
  O
that O
he O
( O
Edward B-PERSON
) O
was O
still O
so O
young O
and O
so O
susceptible O
, O
he O
might O
find O
that O
he O
|
      | O
had O
imbibed O
principles O
, O
and O
been O
tempted O
to O
wrong O
almost O
unconsciously O
, O
and O
suffer O
from O
its O
|
      | O
effects O
when O
too O
late O
to O
escape O
. O
They O
wrote O
as O
affectionately O
and O
indulgently O
as O
they O
|
      | O
could O
— O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
, O
as O
well O
as O
his O
aunt O
and O
uncle O
  O
but O
still O
they O
felt O
that O
it O
certainly O
did O
|
      | O
appear O
cruel O
to O
warn O
a O
young O
, O
warm O
heart O
to O
break O
off O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
friendship O
it O
had O
formed O
  O
|
      | O
especially O
as O
he O
beheld O
that O
friend O
approved O
of O
by O
his O
captain O
, O
and O
looked O
up O
to O
by O
the O
crew O
. O
|
      | O
And O
that O
Edward B-PERSON
's O
reply O
was O
somewhat O
cold O
, O
though O
he O
did O
promise O
caution O
, O
and O
assure O
them O
he O
|
      | O
had O
not O
so O
forgotten O
the O
influences O
and O
principles O
of O
Oakwood B-ORG
as O
to O
allow O
any O
one O
to O
lead O
him O
|
      | O
into O
error O
, O
did O
not O
surprise O
them O
. O
He O
never O
referred O
to O
Harding B-PERSON
again O
, O
except O
sometimes O
|
      | O
casually O
to O
mention O
his O
companionship O
, O
or O
some O
act O
which O
had O
won O
him O
approval O
  O
and O
they O
really O
|
      | O
hoped O
their O
letters O
had O
had O
at O
least O
the O
effect O
of O
putting O
him O
on O
his O
guard O
. O
Sir O
Edward B-PERSON

      | O
Manly B-ORG
's O
own O
reply O
to O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
's O
anxious O
appeal O
to O
him O
, O
however O
, O
succeeded O
in O
quieting O
|
      | O
their O
fears O
  O
he O
assured O
them O
he O
had O
seen O
nothing O
in O
Harding B-PERSON
's O
conduct O
, O
since O
he O
had O
been O
at O
|
      | O
sea O
, O
to O
render O
him O
an O
unfit O
companion O
for O
any O
boy O
: O
that O
he O
had O
heard O
of O
some O
boyish O
faults O
, O
|
      | O
but O
it O
was O
rather O
hard O
he O
was O
to O
suffer O
from O
them O
as O
a O
man O
  O
and O
he O
assured O
his O
friends O
that O
he O
|
      | O
would O
keep O
a O
strict O
look O
- O
out O
after O
young O
Fortescue B-PERSON
, O
and O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
appearance O
of O
a O
change O
in O
a O
|
      | O
character O
which O
, O
young O
as O
he O
was O
, O
he O
could O
not O
help O
loving O
, O
should O
be O
inquired O

and O
the O

      | O
friendship O
ended O
by O
sending O
Harding B-PERSON
to O
some O
other O
ship O
. O
So O
wrote O
Sir O
Edward B-PERSON
Manly I-PERSON
, O
with O
the O

      | O
fullest O
possible O
intention O
to O
perform O
  O
and O
Edward B-PERSON
's O
anxious O
friends O
were O
happy O
, O
more O
|
      | O
especially O
as O
letter O
after O
letter O
brought O
praises O

his O

brief O

were O
affectionate O

satisfactory O

It O
was O
happy O
for O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
and O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
, O
too O
, O
that O
they O
were O
ignorant O
of O
the O

      | O
multiplicity O
of O
great O

which O
could O

eighteen B-DATE

  | O
Edward B-PERSON
's O
life O

its O
pleasures O

indulgences O
so O
innocent O
, O

      | O
so O
numerous O
, O
that O
he O
did O
not O
himself O
know O
his O
liability O
to O
temptation O
, O
from O
the O
excessive O
love O

      | O
of O
pleasure O
which O
his O
mother O

indiscreet O

The O

which O

      | O
his O
uncle O

Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
exercised O
over O

been O
so O
very O
gentle O

forbearing O
, O
that O
he O

      | O
had O
scarcely O
ever O
felt O
the O
inclination O
to O
exert O
self O

, O
and O
when O
it O
so O
chanced O
that O
he O
had O
, O
|
      | O
Ellen B-PERSON
had O
covered O
his O
fault O
, O
or O
borne O
its O
penalty O
for O
him O
. O
He O
thought O
he O
had O
guided O
himself O
, O

      | O
when O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
he O
was O
guided O
  O

this O
could O
no O
longer O
be O
the O
case O
when O
one B-CARDINAL

Outward B-PERSON

captain O

the O

And O
almost O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
action O
of O
Edward B-PERSON
's O
|
      | O
unbiased O
will O
was O
indignantly O
to O
tear O

for O
the O
wrong O
that O

him O

on O
such O

unfounded O
aspersions O
on O
his O

When O
Mrs. O

that O
her O

be O
subjected O
to O
any O
scrutiny O
but O
their O
own O
, O
she O
acted O
on O
a O
principle O
which O
many O
parents O
and O

      | O
guardians O
would O
consider O
as O
high O
- O
flown O

romantic O
, O
and O
which O
she O
herself O
had O
most O
painful O

      | O
reason O
to O
regret O
— O
the O
effects O
, O
at O

, O
but O
not O
the O
principle O
itself O
, O
for O
that O
was O
based O
on O

      | O
too O
refined O
a O
feeling O

waver O

even O
though O
she O
suffered O
from O
it O

She O
could O
not O
bear O
, O
nor O

      | O
could O
her O

, O
the O
system O
which O
prevailed O
in O
some O

that O

      | O
their O
children O

neither O

their O
intimate O

without O

As O
for O

a O
letter O
directed O
to O

      | O
one B-CARDINAL
of O

its O

saw O
it O
, O
as O
they O
had O
seen O

, O
it O
was O
, O
in O
their O
estimation O
, O

      | O
as O
much O
dishonor O

as O

as O
if O
such O

Perfect O
confidence O

indeed O
instilled O

that O

There O
was O
a O

      | O
degree O
of O
suspicion O
attached O

a O

what O
a O
child O
had O
written O

      | O
from O
which O
Mrs. O

actually O
shrunk O

In O
the B-DATE
many I-DATE
months I-DATE
the O

      | O
Grahame B-PERSON
family O
passed O
in O
London B-GPE
, O
Annie B-PERSON
and O
Caroline B-PERSON
corresponded O
without O
the O
least O
restraint O
: O
|
      | O
no O
doubt O
many O
would O
pronounce O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
very O
unwise O
, O
knowing O
Annie B-PERSON
so O
well O
, O
and O
trembling O
|
      | O
for O
Caroline B-PERSON
as O
she O
did O
  O
but O
, O
as O
she O
told O
Miss O
Harcourt B-PERSON
, O
she O
had O
some O
notions O
peculiar O
to O
|
      | O
herself O
( O
they O
always O
had O
the O
sanction O
and O
sympathy O
of O
her O
husband O
, O
however O
) O
, O
and O
this O
was O
one O
|
      | O
of O
them O
. O
She O
was O
always O
pleased O
and O
interested O
in O
all O
that O
her O
children O
read O
to O
her O
, O
either O

      | O
from O
their O
own O
epistles O

those O
they O
received O
, O
and O
if O
they O
wished O
it O
, O
read O
them O
herself O
, O
but O
|
      | O
she O
never O
asked O
to O
do O
so O
, O
and O
the O
consequence O
was O
, O
that O
the O
most O
perfect O
confidence O
was O
|
      | O
given O
. O
| 
  | O
When O
Ellen B-PERSON
and O
Edward B-PERSON
parted O
, O
they O
were O
both O
so O
young O
, O
that O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
had O
hesitated O
as O
to O
|
      | O
whether O
his O
wife O
was O
quite O
justified O
in O
the O
perfect O
trust O
with O
which O
she O
treated O
them O
, O
and O
|
      | O
whether O
it O
would O
not O
be O
wiser O
to O
overlook O
their O
correspondence O
  O
but O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
so O
argued O
|
      | O
that O
their O
very O
youth O
was O
their O
safeguard O
, O
that O
they O
were O
all O
in O
all O
to O
each O
other O
, O
and O
as O
|
      | O
such O
she O
wished O
them O
to O
feel O
they O
were O
bound O
by O
even O
a O
closer O
and O
a O
fonder O
tie O
than O
that O
of O
|
      | O
brother O
and O
sister O
under O
other O
circumstances O
, O
so O
won O
over O
her O
husband O
that O
he O
yielded O
  O
and O

      | O
from O
the O
long O

Miss O

Mrs. O

herself O

      | O
for O

at O

no O

from O

      | O
that O
Ellen B-PERSON

which O
for O
one B-DATE
brief I-DATE

      | O
had O
so O
characterized O

seemed O
completely O

so O
insensibly O
to O

gone O
, O
that O
Mrs. O

Her O

her O

gently O
questioned O

her O
temper O
was O
so O

      | O
altered O
, O
Ellen B-PERSON
confessed O
with O

      | O
believed O

Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
called O
in O
Mr. O
Maitland B-PERSON

who O
said O
that O
she O
really O

      | O
was O
in O
a O
highly O
nervous O
state O
, O

required O
care O

the O
less O

that O
was O

      | O
taken O

her O
momentary O
irritability O

Little O
did O
the O

      | O
imagine O
how O
his O
young O

blessed O
him O

  O
giving O
a O
reason O

the O
trepidation O

paled O
her O

bewilderment O

either O

of O

      | O
the O
incomprehensible O
disappearance O
of O
her O
allowance O

naturally O
compelled O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
to O
|
      | O
revert O
to O
the O
propensity O
of O
her O
childhood O
, O
and O
fear O
that O
truthfulness O
was O
again O
deserting O

Her O

the O

almost O
appeared O

defiance O

in O

reality O

was O
almost O
despair O

For O
six B-DATE

before I-DATE
the I-DATE

on O
which O
we O
recommence O
our O
narrative O
, O
there O
had O
been O
, O

      | O
however O
, O
nothing O
to O
complain O
of O
in O
Ellen B-GPE
, O
except O
still O
that O
unnatural O
reserve O
and O
frequent O
|
      | O
depression O
, O
as O
if O
dreading O
something O
she O
knew O
not O
what O
, O
which O
, O
as O
every O
other O
part O
of O
her O
|
      | O
conduct O
was O
satisfactory O
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
tried O
to O
comfort O
herself O
was O
physical O
alone O
. O
No O
|
      | O
reference O
to O
the O
past O
was O
ever O
made O
: O
her O
manner O
to O
her O
niece O
became O
the O
same O
as O
usual O
  O
but O
she O
|
      | O
could O
not O
feel O
secure O
as O
to O
her O
character O
, O
and O
, O
what O
was O
most O
painful O
, O
there O
were O
times O
when O
|
      | O
she O
was O
compelled O
to O
doubt O
even O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
affection O
for O
herself O
, O
a O
thing O
she O
had O
never O
had O
the O
|
      | O
slightest O
cause O
to O
do O
even O
when O
she O
was O
a O
little O
inanimate O
child O
. O
| 
  | O
But O
very O
few O
changes O
had O
taken O
place O
in O
the O
Greville B-PERSON
and O
Grahame O
families O
. O
Mrs. O
Greville B-PERSON
's O
|
      | O
trial O
continued O
in O
unmitigated O
, O
if O
not O
heightened O
bitterness O
: O
the O
example O
, O
the O
companionship O
|
      | O
of O
his O
father O
had O
appeared O
to O
have O
blighted O
every O
good O
seed O
which O
she O
had O
strenuously O
|
      | O
endeavored O
to O
plant O
in O
the O
bosom O
of O
her O
son O
. O
At O
sixteen B-DATE
he O
was O
already O
an O
accomplished O
man O
of O
|
      | O
the O
world O
, O
in O
its O
most O
painful O
sense O
: O
he O
had O
his O
own O
companions O
, O
his O
own O
haunts O
  O
scarcely O
ever O
|
      | O
visiting O
his O
home O
, O
for O
a O
reason O
which O
, O
could O
his O
poor O
mother O
have O
known O
it O
, O
would O
have O
given O
|
      | O
her O
some O
slight O
gleam O
of O
comfort O
. O
He O
could O
not O
associate O
either O
with O
her O
or O
his O
sister O
, O
|
      | O
without O
feeling O
a O
sort O
of O
loathing O
of O
himself O
, O
a O
longing O
to O
be O
to O
them O
as O
Percy B-PERSON
and O
Herbert B-PERSON
|
      | O
Hamilton B-PERSON
were O
at O
Oakwood B-ORG
  O
and O
not O
having O
the O
moral O
courage O
sufficient O
to O
break O
from O
the O
|
      | O
control O
of O
his O
father O
, O
and O
the O
exciting O
pleasures O
in O
which O
that O
control O
initiated O
him O
, O
he O
|
      | O
shrunk O
more O
and O
more O
from O
the O
only O
spot O
in O
which O
better O
feelings O
were O
so O
awakened O
within O
him O
|
      | O
as O
to O
give O
him O
pain O
. O
To O
deaden O
this O
unacknowledged O
remorse O
, O
his O
manner O
was O
rude O
and O
unfeeling O
, O
|
      | O
so O
that O
his O
very O
visits O
, O
though O
inexpressibly O
longed O
for O
by O
his O
mother O
, O
brought O
only O
increase O
|
      | O
of O
grief O
. O
| 
  | O
Mrs. O
Greville B-PERSON
seemed O
herself O
so O
inured O
to O
suffering O
, O
that O
she O
bore O
up O
against O
it O
without O
any O
|
      | O
visible O
failing O
of O
health O
  O
struggling O
against O
its O
enervating O
effects O
, O
more O
, O
perhaps O
, O
than O
she O
|
      | O
was O
aware O
of O
herself O
, O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
one B-CARDINAL
treasure O
still O
granted O
her O
— O
her O
own O
almost O
angel O
|
      | O
Mary B-PERSON
— O
who O
, O
she O
knew O
, O
without O
her O
love O
and O
constant O
cheerfulness O
, O
must O
sink O
beneath O
such O
a O
|
      | O
constant O
aggravated O
trial O
. O
Yet O
that O
very O
love O
brought O
increase O
of O
anxiety O
from O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
|
      | O
cause O
. O
As O
yet O
there O
was O
no O
change O
in O
their O
manner O
of O
living O
, O
but O
Mrs. O
Greville B-PERSON
knew O
that O
, O
from O
|
      | O
the O
excesses O
of O
her O
husband O
and O
son O
, O
there O
very O
soon O
must O
be O
. O
Ruin O
, O
poverty O
, O
all O
its O
fearful O
|
      | O
ills O
, O
stood O
before O
her O
in O
perspective O
, O
and O
how O
could O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
fragile O
frame O
and O
gentle O
spirit O
|
      | O
bear O
up O
against O
them O
? O
Again O
and O
again O
the O
question O
pressed O
upon O
her O
— O
Did O
Herbert B-PERSON
Hamilton I-PERSON
|
      | O
indeed O
love O
her O
child O
, O
as O
every O
passing O
year O
seemed O
to O
confirm O
? O
and O
if O
he O
did O
, O
would O
— O
could O
his O
|
      | O
parents O
consent O
to O
his O
union O
with O
the O
child O
of O
such O
a O
father O
, O
the O
sister O
of O
such O
a O
brother O
? O
|
      | O
There O
were O
always O
long O
messages O
to O
Mary B-PERSON
in O
Herbert B-PERSON
's O
letters O
to O
his O
mother O
, O
which O
Mrs. O
|
      | O
Hamilton B-PERSON
not O
only O
delivered O
herself O
, O
but O
sometimes O
even O
put O
the O
whole O
letter O
into O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
hand O
, O
|
      | O
and O
at O
last O
laughingly O
said O
, O
she O
really O
thought O
they O
had O
much O
better O
write O
to O
each O
other O
, O
as O
|
      | O
then O
she O
should O
chance O
to O
get O
a O
letter O
all O
to O
herself O
, O
not O
merely O
be O
the O
medium O
of O
a O
|
      | O
communication O
between O
them O
  O
and O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
though O
she O
did O
slightly O
blush O
, O
which O
she O
was O
in O
the O
|
      | O
habit O
of O
doing O
for O
scarcely O
any O
thing O
, O
seemed O
to O
think O
it O
so O
perfectly O
natural O
, O
that O
she O
|
      | O
merely O
said O
, O
if O
Herbert B-PERSON
had O
time O
to O
write O
to O
her O
, O
she O
should O
like O
it O
very O
much O
, O
and O
would O
|
      | O
certainly O
answer O
him O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
My O
dear O
Emmeline O
, O
what O
are O
you O
about O
? O
" O
was O
Mrs. O
Greville B-PERSON

anxious O
appeal O
, O
the O
moment O
they O

      | O
were O
alone O
. O

Mrs. O

" O

answered O
the O
poor O
mother O
, O
with O
such O
a O
quivering O
of O
the O
|
      | O
eye O
and O
lip O
, O
that O
it O
checked O
Mrs. O

joyousness O

once O

a O
pressure O
of O
Mrs. O

being O
sent O
to O
Eton B-PERSON
some O

      | O
time O
before O
his O
father O
had O
intended O
  O
but O
so O
many O
cases O
of O
Lady B-PERSON
Helen I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
faulty O
indolence O
and O
|
      | O
ruinous O
indulgence O
had O
come O
under O
his O
notice O

that O
he O
felt O
to O
remove O
the O
boy O
from O
her O

      | O
influence O
must O
be O
accomplished O
at O
any O
cost O
. O
Cecil O
was O
quite O
delighted O
, O
but O
his O
mother O
was O
so O

      | O
indignant O
, O
that O
she O
overcame O
her O
habitual O
awe O
of O
her O
husband O
sufficiently O
to O
vow O
that O
she O

      | O

not O
live O
so O
far O

her O
son O

Moorlands B-GPE

|
      | O
Grahame B-GPE
, O
with O
equal O
positiveness O
, O
declared O
that O
he O
would O
not O
give O
up O
a O
home O

him O
so O

      | O
long O

entirely O
break O
off O
his O
companionship O

. O
A O
very O
stormy O

      | O
dialogue O
of O
course O
took O
place O
, O
and O
ended O
by O
both O
parties O
being O
more O
resolved O
to O
entertain O

      | O
their O
own O
opinion O
. O
The O
interposition O
of O
Mr. O

Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
however O
, O
obtained O
some O
|
      | O
concession O
on O
Grahame B-GPE
's O
part O
, O
and O
he O
promised O
that O
if O
Lady B-PERSON
Helen I-PERSON
would O
make O
Moorlands B-GPE
her O
home O

      | O
from O

the B-DATE
end I-DATE
of I-DATE
October I-DATE

should O
be O
spent O
in O
the O

      | O
vicinity O
of O
Eton B-ORG

she O
should O
then O
have O
six B-DATE
months I-DATE
for O
London B-GPE
and O
its O
attractions O
. O
This O
|
      | O
concession O
brought O
back O
all O
Lady B-PERSON
Helen I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
smiles O
, O
and O
charmed O
Annie B-PERSON
, O
though O
it O
was O
a O
source O
of O
|
      | O
real O
regret O
to O
Caroline B-GPE
, O
who O
could O
not O
help O
feeling O
a O
little O
pained O
at O
her O
friend O

small O
|
      | O
concern O
at O
this O
long O
separation O
from O
her O
. O
But O
still O
she O
loved O
her O
  O
and O
, O
as O
Annie B-PERSON
wrote O
|
      | O
frequently O
, O
and O
when O
she O
was O
at O
Moorlands B-GPE
never O
tired O
of O
her O
society O
( O
the B-DATE
eight I-DATE
months I-DATE
of O

      | O
absence O
giving O
her O
so O
much O
interesting O
matter O
to O
impart O
) O
, O
Caroline B-PERSON
was O
not O
only O
satisfied O
, O
but O
|
      | O
insensible O
to O
the O
utter O
want O
of O
sympathy O
which O
Annie B-PERSON
manifested O
in O
|  | O
her O
|  | O
pursuits O
, O
|
        | O
her O
|  | O
pleasures O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
often O
wished O
that O
Caroline B-GPE
had O
chosen O
one B-CARDINAL
more O
deserving O
|
      | O
of O
her O
friendship O
, O
but O
she O
trusted O
that O
time O
and O
experience O
would O
teach O
her O
Annie B-PERSON
's O
real O
|
      | O
character O
, O
and O
so O
did O
not O
feel O
any O
anxiety O
on O
that O
score O
. O
| 
  | O
There O
was O
only O
one B-CARDINAL
member O
in O
Grahame B-GPE
's O
family O
, O
that O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
hoped O
might O
bring O
|
      | O
joy O
and O
comfort O
to O
their O
friend O
, O
and O
that O
was O
his O
little O
Lilla B-PERSON
. O
She O
was O
five B-DATE
years I-DATE
younger O
|
      | O
than O
Annie B-PERSON
, O
and O
being O
much O
less O
attractive O
, O
seemed O
almost O
forgotten O
, O
and O
so O
was O
spared O
the O

      | O
dangerous O
ordeal O
of O
flattery O
and O
indulgence O
to O
which O
Annie B-ORG
had O
been O
subject O
  O
and O
from O
being O

      | O
more O
violent O

less O
agreeable O
than O
Cecil O
, O
was O
not O
so O
frequently O
spoiled O
by O
her O
mother O
. O
They O

      | O
feared O
the O
poor O
child O
would O
have O
much O
to O
endure O
from O
her O

temper O
, O
Annie B-PERSON

overbearing O

      | O
insolence O
, O

thought O

seeming O
determined O

Ellen B-PERSON
read O
nearly O
the O
whole O
letter O
aloud O

it O
was O
unusually O
entertaining O
, O
for O
the O
ship O

      | O
had O
been O
cruising O
about O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
month I-DATE

Edward B-PERSON
described O
the O
various O
scenes O

new O
places O
|
      | O
he O
had O
visited O
more O
lengthily O
than O
usual O
. O
He O
anticipated O
with O
great O
glee O
an O
engagement O
with O
|
      | O
some O
desperate O
pirates O
, O
whose O
track O
they O
were O
pursuing O

" O

abruptly O

saying O
they O
have O
just O
piped O
all O
hands O
, O
and O
he O
must O
|
      | O
be O
off O
. O
The O
direction O
does O
not O
seem O
his O
writing O
. O
" O

  | O
" O
Nor O
is O
it O
  O
Sir O

sealed O
, O
directed O
, O
and O
put O
it O
up O
for O
him O
in O
his O
own O
to O
me O
. O
They O
had O
|
      | O
piped O
all O
hands O
, O
as O
he O
calls O
it O
, O
because O
the O
pirate O
ship O
was O
in O
sight O
, O
and O
an O
engagement O
did O
|
      | O
take O
place O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
And O
Edward B-PERSON
— O
oh O
, O
uncle O
, O
is O
he O
hurt O
? O
I O
am O
sure O
, O
he O
is O
, O
by O
your O
face O
, O
" O
exclaimed O
Ellen B-PERSON
  O
|
      | O
trembling O
and O
all O
the O
little O
circle O
looked O
alarmed O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Then O
my O
face O
is O
a O
deceiver O
, O
" O
replied O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
quite O
cheerfully O
. O
" O
He O
only O
received O
a O
|
      | O
slight O
flesh O
wound O
in O
his O
right O
arm O
, O
which O
prevented O
his O
using O
it O
to O
complete O
his O
letter O
, O
and O
|
      | O
I O
rather O
think O
, O
he O
would O
have O
willingly O
been O
hurt O
still O
more O
, O
to O
receive O
such O
praises O
as O
Sir O

      | O
Edward B-PERSON
lavishes O
on O
him O
. O
Listen O
to O
what O
he O
says—'Not O
a O
boy O
or O
man O
on O
board O
distinguished O
|
      | O
himself O
more O
than O
your O
nephew O
: O
in O
fact O
, O
I O
am O
only O
astonished O
he O
escaped O
as O
he O
did O
, O
for O
those O
|
      | O
pirates O
are O
desperate O
fighters O
, O
and O
when O
we O
boarded O
them O
, O
Fortescue B-PERSON
was O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
them O
, O
|
      | O
fighting O
like O
a O
young O
lion O
. O
Courage O
and O
gallantry O
are O
such O
dazzling O
qualities O
in O
a O
young O
lad O
, O
|
      | O
that O
we O
think O
more O
of O
them O
perhaps O
than O
we O
ought O
, O
but O
I O
can O
not O
say O
too O
much O
for O
your O
nephew O
  O
|
      | O
I O
have O
not O
a O
lad O
more O
devoted O
to O
his O
duty O
. O
I O
was O
glad O
to O
show O
him O
my O
approbation O
by O
giving O
him O
|
      | O
some O
days O
' O
liberty O
, O
when O
we O
were O
off O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
  O
but O
I O
have O
since O
told O
him O
, O
the O
air O
of O
land O
|
      | O
certainly O
did O
not O
agree O
with O
him O
, O
for O
he O
has O
looked O
paler O
and O
thinner O
ever O
since O
. O
He O
is O
|
      | O
growing O
very O
fast O
  O
and O
altogether O
, O
if O
I O
have O
occasion O
to O
send O
another O
prize O
schooner O
home O
, O
I O
|
      | O
think O
it O
not O
improbable O
I O
shall O
nominate O
him O
as O
one O
of O
the O
officers O
, O
that O
he O
may O
have O
the O
|
      | O
benefit O
of O
the O
healthful O
breezes O
of O
Old B-LOC
England I-LOC
, O
to O
bring O
back O
his O
full O
strength O
. O
' O
There O
|
      | O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
I O
think O
that O
is O
a O
still O
better O
birthday O
- O
present O
than O
even O
Edward B-PERSON
's O
own O
letter O
. O
I O
am O
as O
|
      | O
proud O
of O
my O
nephew O
as O
Sir O
Edward B-PERSON
is O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
And O
do O
you O
think O
he O
really O
will O
come O
? O
" O
asked O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
trying O
to O
conquer O
her O
emotion O
. O
| 
  | O
" O

will O
hope O
it O

her O

kindly O
. O
" O
But O
do O
not O
think O
too O
much O
about O
it O

      | O
even O
if O
Sir O
Edward B-PERSON
be O
not O
able O

home O
in O
a B-DATE

two B-CARDINAL

you O
owned O
to O
me O
yourself O
this B-TIME
morning I-TIME
, O
it O
did O
not O
seem O
as O
long O

it O
really O
is O
, O
since O

      | O
our O
dear O
sailor O
left O

the O

time O

your O
breakfast O

go O

      | O
love O

enjoy O
his O
letter O
again O
to O
yourself O

" O
| 
  | O
And O
Ellen B-PERSON
gladly O
obeyed O
  O
for O
it O
was O
from O
no O
imaginary O
cause O
that O
the O
receipt O
of O
Edward B-PERSON
's O
|
      | O
letters O
so O
often O
paled O
her O
cheek O
, O
and O
parched O
her O
lip O
with O
terror O
. O
She O
knew O
that O
concerning O
|
      | O
him O
which O
none O
else O
but O
Harding B-PERSON
did O
  O
and O
even O
when O
those O
letters O
imparted O
nothing O
but O
that O
|
      | O
which O
she O
could O
read O
to O
her O
family O
, O
the O
dread O
was O
quite O
enough O
to O
banish O
any O
thing O
like O
the O
|
      | O
elastic O
happiness O
, O
natural O
to O
her O
age O
, O
and O
called O
for O
by O
the O
kindness O
of O
those O
she O
loved O
. O
His O
|
      | O
letter O
this O
time O
, O
however O
, O
had O
not O
a O
word O
to O
call O
for O
that O
sickness O
of O
the O
heart O
, O
with O
which O

      | O
she O
had O
received O
it O

she O
read O
it O
again O

again O
  O
with O
a O
thankfulness O
, O
too O
intense O
for O

      | O
words O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
You O
dropped O
this O

the O
voice O

at O
her O
door O

ten B-TIME

as O
she O
looked O
at O
its O
length O
, O
not O
at O

from O
the O

she O
had O
so O
buoyed O
herself O
with O
the O

hope O

that O
even O

almost O
awful O

all O
the O

      | O
would O
say O
it O
was O
such O

be O
unhappy O
all O

this O

you O

Ellen B-PERSON

conquered O
her O

absolute O
agony O

nerved O
herself O

thinking O

very O
silly O

minutes I-TIME

it O
passed O
, O
and O
deliberately O
putting O
on O
her O
bonnet O
and O
|
      | O
shawl O
, O
she O
took O
up O
her O
trinkets O
, O
and O
set O
off O
to O
the O
widow O
's O
cottage O
, O
her O
limbs O
so O
trembling O
, O
|
      | O
that O
she O
knew O
not O
how O
she O
should O
accomplish O
even O
that O
short O
walk O
. O

The O
wind O
was O
unusually O
high O
, O
although O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
was O
otherwise O
lovely O
, O
and O
she O
was O
scarcely O
|
      | O
able O
to O
stand O
against O
the O
strong O
breeze O
, O
especially O
as O
every O
breath O
seemed O
to O
increase O
the O
|
      | O
pain O
in O
her O
temples O
  O
but O
she O
persisted O
. O
The O
nearest O
path O
lay O
through O
a O
thick O
shrubbery O
, O
almost O
|
      | O
a O
wood O
, O
which O
the O
family O
never O
used O
, O
and O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
the O
younger O
members O
were O
prohibited O
from O
|
      | O
taking O
, O
but O
secrecy O
and O
haste O
were O
all O
which O
at O
that O
moment O
entered O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
mind O
. O
She O
felt O
so O
|
      | O
exhausted O
by O
the O
wind O
blowing O
the O
branches O
and O
leaves O
noisily O
and O
confusedly O
around O
, O
that O
on O
|
      | O
reaching O
a O
sort O
of O
grassy O
glade O
, O
more O
open O
than O
her O
previous O
path O
, O
she O
sat O
down O
a B-TIME
minute I-TIME
on O
a O
|
      | O
mossy O
stone O
. O
The O
wind O
blew O
some O
withered O
sticks O
and O
leaves O
toward O
her O
, O
and O
, O
among O
them O
, O
two B-CARDINAL
or O
|
      | O
three B-CARDINAL
soiled O
pieces O
of O
thin O
paper O
, O
stained O
with O
damp O
, O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
which O
she O
raised O
mechanically O
, O
|
      | O
and O
started O
up O
with O
a O
wild O
cry O
, O
and O
seized O
the O
others O
almost O
unconsciously O
. O
She O
pressed O
her O
|
      | O
hands O
over O
her O
eyes O
, O
and O
her O
lips O
moved O
in O
the O
utterance O
of O
thanksgiving O
. O
" O
Saved!—Edward O

      | O
myself O

not O
actually O
spoken O

were O
so O

      | O
distinctly O

in O
her O
heart O

that O
she O
thought O
she O
heard O
them O
  O
and O
she O
retraced O
her O
steps O
, O
|
      | O
so O
swiftly O
— O
so O
gladly O
, O
the O
very O
pain O
and O
exhaustion O
were O
unfelt O

She O
wrote O
for O
half B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour I-TIME

      | O
intently O
— O
eagerly O

that O

not O
herself O

never O
could O
recall O

took O

secret O

, O
when O
Percy B-PERSON

so O

      | O
laughingly O
showed O
her O

had O
found O

As O
she O
did O
so O
, O
she O
discovered O
that O
two B-CARDINAL
had O
clung O
so O
closely O
together O
that O
the O
sum O
|
      | O
was O
five B-QUANTITY
pounds I-QUANTITY
more O

she O
wanted O

Still O

as O
acting O
under O
the O
influence O
of O
some O
spell O
, O
she O
|
      | O
carelessly O
put O
one B-CARDINAL
aside O

sealed O
up O
the O
packet O

Edward B-PERSON

inclosed O

uncle O

Sir O

Edward B-PERSON
Manly I-PERSON
, O
and O
dispatched O
it O
full O
four B-TIME
hours I-TIME
before O
the O
hour O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
had O
named O
. O
It O
was O
|
      | O
gone O
  O
and O
she O
sat O
down O
to O
breathe O
. O
Some O
impulse O
, O
never O
experienced O
before O
, O
urged O
her O
, O
instead O
|
      | O
of O
destroying O
Edward B-PERSON
's O
desperate O
letter O
, O
as O
she O
had O
done O
similar O
appeals O

to O
retain O
it O
in O
a O
|
      | O
blank O
envelop O
in O
that O
same O
secret O
drawer O
. O
As O
she O
tried O
to O
rouse O
herself O
from O
a O
sort O
of O
stupor O
|
      | O
which O
was O
strangely O
creeping O
over O
her O
, O
her O
eye O
caught O
the O
five B-CARDINAL
pound O
note O
which O
she O
had O
not O
|
      | O
had O
occasion O
to O
use O
, O
and O
a O
thought O
of O
such O
overwhelming O
wretchedness O
rushed O
upon O
her O
, O
as O
|
      | O
effectually O
, O
for O
the O
moment O
, O
to O
disperse O
that O
stupor O
, O
and O
prostrate O
her O
in O
an O
agony O
of O

      | O
supplication O
before O
her O
God O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
What O

I O
done?"—if O
her O
almost O
maddening O
thoughts O
could O
have O
found O
words O
, O
such O
they O
would O

been—"How O

How O
long O
that O
withering O
agony B-PERSON

Ellen B-PERSON
knew O
not O

, O
or O
lay O

      | O
scorching O
her O
eyes O
and O
heart O
. O
The O
note O
lay O
before O
her O
like O
some O
hideous O
specter O
, O
from O
which O

      | O
she O
vainly O
tried O
to O
turn O

blown O

tried O

rise O

do O
so O
  O

, O
to O
her O
own O
terror O
, O
she O
found O
she O
was O
|
      | O
so O
powerless O
, O
that O
she O
actually O
could O
not O
walk O
. O
With O
desperate O
calmness O
she O
placed O
it O
in O
the O
|
      | O
little O
secret O
drawer O
, O
put O
up O
the O
remainder O
of O
her O
papers O

closed O

locked O
her O
desk O

laid O

down O

up O

Ellis O
came O
to O
her O
with O
an O
inquiry O
after O
her O

if O

take O
her O
dinner O

Ellen B-PERSON
asked O
for O

cup O

to O
be O
left O
quite O

      | O
quiet O
instead O

as O
writing O
had O
not O
decreased O
the O
pain O

the O
housekeeper O
, O
accustomed O
to O
such O

      | O
casual O
attacks O
, O
did O
as O
she O
was O
requested O

came O
frequently O
to O
see O
her O
in O
the O
course O
of O
the O
|
      | O
afternoon B-TIME

evening B-TIME
  O
still O

perceiving O
any O
thing O

, O
therefore O
, O
not O

Thought O
after O

congregated O
in O
the O
poor O
girl O

mind O

as O
she O
thus O
lay O
  O
so O
fraught O
with O

      | O
agony O
that O
the O
physical O
suffering O

which O
was O
far O
more O

unfelt O

in O
its O

      | O
paralyzing O
effect O
on O
every O
limb O

Her O
impulse O
was O
to O
confess O
exactly O
what O
she O
had O
done O
to O
her O
|
      | O
aunt O
, O
the O
moment O
she O
should O
see O
her O
, O
and O
conjure O
her O
to O
sentence O
her O
to O
some O
heavy O
|
      | O
chastisement O
, O
that O
must O
deaden O
her O
present O
agony O
  O

this O
was O
impossible O
without O
betraying O

Edward B-PERSON

nullifying O
for O
him O
the O
relief O

How O

she O
confess O
the O
sin O

      | O
the O
full O
confession O
of O
the O
use O

that O
money O

been O
applied O

Whose O
were O
the O
notes O

were O
stained O

damp O

as O

lain O
among O
those O
withered O
leaves O
some O
time O
  O

and O
yet O
she O
had O
heard O

about O

loss O

sum O

surely O

have O
demanded O

The O
only O
plan O

as O
bringing O
the O
least O
hope O
of O
returning O

      | O
peace O

was O
still O
to O
beseech O
Mrs. O

dispose O

it O

too O

gave O
her O
trinkets O

one O
, O
not O
all O

more O
easily O
prevail O

her O
to O
grant O
her O
secrecy O

assistance O

disposal O

would O
solemnly O
promise O
secrecy O

tell O
her O
so O
much O
of O
her O
intense O
misery O
, O
as O
might O

      | O
perhaps O
induce O
her O
to O
give O
her O
aid O

If O
she O
did O
not O
demand O
the O
reason O
and O
betrayed O
her O
, O
she O

      | O
must O
endure O
the O
doubt O
and O
serious O
displeasure O
such O
a O
course O

acting O
on O
her O
part O

  | O
Mr. O
Maitland B-PERSON
declared O
Ellen B-PERSON
to O
be O
ill O
of O
a O
nervous O
fever O
which O
for O
three B-DATE
days I-DATE
confined O
her O

      | O
to O
her O
bed O
, O
and O
left O
her O
very O
weak O
for O
some O
little O
time O
, O
and O
so O
nervous O
that O
the O
least O
thing O
|
      | O
seemed O
to O
startle O
her O
  O
but O
, O
as O
he O
said O
it O
was O
no O
consequence O
, O
and O
she O
would O
soon O
recover O
, O
Mrs. O

      | O
Hamilton B-PERSON
adopted O
his O
advice O
, O
took O
no O
notice O
of O
it O
, O
and O
only O
endeavored O
to O
make O
her O
niece O

      | O
daily B-DATE
routine O
as O
varied O

regular O
in O

undisturbed O
in O
quiet O
, O
as O

      | O
she O
could O
. O
Perhaps O
she O
would O
have O
felt O
more O
anxious O
, O
and O
discovered O
something O
not O
quite O
usual O

      | O
in O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
manner O
, O
if O
her O
thoughts O
had O
not O
been O
painfully O
pre O

About B-DATE
a I-DATE
week I-DATE
after O

      | O
their O
excursion O
she O
entered O
the O
library O
earlier O
than O
usual O
, O
and O
found O
her O
husband O
intently O

      | O
engaged O
with O
some O
dispatches O
just O
received O
. O
She O
saw O
he O
was O
more O
than O
ordinarily O
disturbed O
, O
and O
|
      | O
hesitated O
a O
moment O
whether O
to O
address O
him O
  O
but O
he O
was O
seldom O
so O
engrossed O
as O
to O
be O
unconscious O
|
      | O
of O
the O
presence O
of O
his O
wife O

" O
I O

really O
glad O

here O
at O
this O
moment O

Emmeline B-ORG

for O
I O
actually O
was O
weak O
enough O
to O

      | O
shrink O
from O
seeking O
you O
with O
unpleasant O
news O

Letters O
from O
Feroe B-PERSON
have O
at O
length O
arrived O
, O
and O
|
      | O
my O
personal O
presence O
is O
so O
imperatively O
needed O
, O
that O
I O
am O
self O
- O
reproached O
at O
not O
going O
before O
  O
|
      | O
the O
long O
silence O
ought O
to O
have O
convinced O
me O
that O
all O
was O
not O
as O
it O
should O
be O
. O
" O

  | O
" O
But O
what O
has O
occurred O
, O
Arthur B-PERSON
? O
I O
had O
no O
idea O
you O
contemplated O
the O
necessity O
of O
going O

" O
|
      | O
replied O
his O
wife O
very O
quietly O
, O
as O
she O
sat O
down O
close O
by O
him O
  O
but O
the O
fiat O
of O
separation O
, O
the O

      | O
thoughts O
of O
a O
perilous O
voyage O
, O
a O
visit O
to O
an O
almost O
desolate O
island O
, O
and O
the O
impossibility O
of O
|
      | O
receiving O
regular O
letters O
, O
so O
crowded O
upon O
her O
all O
at O
once O
, O
that O
it O
was O
a O
strong O
effort O
to O

      | O
speak O
at O
all O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
No O

dearest O
  O
for O
what O

the O
use O

disagreeable O

when O

      | O
there O

from O

, O
as O

      | O
you O
know O
, O
received O
nearly B-DATE
two I-DATE
years I-DATE

me O
that O
Frederic B-PERSON

dead O

that O

as O
civil O
guardian O
of O
the O

      | O
island O
, O
with O
if O
possible O
, O
a O
still O
greater O
degree O
of O
popularity O
than O
his O
predecessors O
, O
from O
his O

      | O
having O
been O
educated O
in O
Denmark B-GPE
. O
His O
parents O
had O
lived O
on O
straitened O
means O
to O
give O
him O

      | O
superior O
advantages O

, O
as O
it O
proves O

much O
better O
without O

The O
vices O

      | O
has O
acquired O

far O
outrun O
the O
advantages O

      | O
irregular O
spirits O

scandalized O
the O
simple O
people O

disturbed O
their O
homesteads O

contention O

misery O

some O
cases O

so O

that O
in O
point O
of O
social O

position O

I O
fear O
they O
have O
sunk O
lower O
than O
when O
my O

      | O
grandfather O
first B-ORDINAL

naturally O

      | O
perhaps O
, O
but O
weakly O

shrunk O
from O

at O

taken O
upon O

nothing O

personal O

      | O
interference O
and O
some O
months B-DATE

residence O
among O

effect O
a O
reformation O

and O
that O
the O

      | O
ruin O
is O
more O
to O
be O
regretted O
, O
as O
the O
little O
island O

been O
for O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
half I-CARDINAL
a O
century O

one B-CARDINAL

exclaiming O

Her O
father O
almost O
involuntarily O
drew O
her O
to O
his O

two B-CARDINAL

without O

bravely O

her O
disposition O

      | O
not O
nearly O

was O
her O

      | O
first B-ORDINAL
sorrow O

Mrs. O

watched O
her O
with O
some O
anxiety O
, O
half B-CARDINAL
fearful O
that O

unequal O

firm O

uncomplaining O
endurance O

Ellen B-PERSON

out O

the O
news O

But O
|
      | O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
was O
so O
struck O
with O
" O
the O
expression O
of O
her O
countenance O
, O
which O
, O
as O
she O
tried O

      | O
somewhat O
incoherently O
to O
utter O
regrets O
, O
took O
the O
place O
of O
its O
usual O
calm O
, O
that O
she O
looked O
at O

      | O
her O
several B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
in O
bewilderment O
  O

it O
passed O
again O

so O
completely O

that O
she O
was O
angry O

with O
herself O
for O
fancying O
any O

Morton B-PERSON
had O
selected O
to O
take O
with O
him O

For O
|
      | O
some O
time O
Robert B-PERSON
pursued O
his O
work O
in O
persevering O
silence O
, O
but O
at O
length O
fixed O
his O
eyes O
on O
his O
|
      | O
master O
with O
such O
beseeching O
earnestness O
, O
that O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
inquired O
the O
matter O
at O
once O
. O
It O
was O
|
      | O
some O
time O
before O
the O
young O
man O
could O
sufficiently O
compose O
himself O
to O
speak O
with O
any O
coherency O
, O
|
      | O
but O
at O
last O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
gathered O
the O
following O
details O
. O

About B-DATE
five I-DATE

( O

      | O

which O
he O
|
      | O
had O
orders O
to O
leave O
at O
some O
poor O
though O
respectable O
families O
, O
whom O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
was O
in O
the O

      | O
habit O
of O
occasionally O
assisting O
, O
though O
they O
were O
out O
of O
his O
own O
domains O
. O
The B-TIME
morning I-TIME
he O
was O
|
      | O
to O
have O
started O
on O
this O
expedition O
a O
cousin O
, O
whom O
he O
had O
always O
regarded O
as O
a O
brother O
, O
came O

      | O
unexpectedly O
to O
see O
him O
. O
He O
had O
just O
arrived O
at O

with O
his O

      | O
regiment O
in O
Ireland B-GPE
: O
and O
Robert B-PERSON
's O
glee O
was O
so O
great O
as O
to O
require O
reiterated O
commands O
from O
the O
|
      | O
steward O
to O
take O
care O
of O
the O

not O

at O
his O
mother O

cottage O
, O
where O
he O
was O
to O
take O
|
      | O
his O
cousin O
, O
later O
than O
the O
afternoon O
. O
He O
lingered O
so O
long O
before O
he O
set O
off O
from O
Oakwood B-ORG
, O
that O
|
      | O
he O
gathered O
up O
all O
the O
papers O
as O
quickly O
as O
he O
could O
, O
forgot O
his O
principal O
charge O
, O
so O
far O
at O
|
      | O
least O
as O
not O
to O
look O
to O
the O
secure O
fastening O
of O
the O
pocket O
- O
book O
, O
and O
hastened O
with O
his O
cousin O

      | O
through O
the O
brushwood O
and O
glade O
we O
have O
before O
mentioned O
, O
to O
his O
mother O
's O
cottage O
. O
It O
was O
very O
|
      | O
hot O
, O
and O
the O
young O
men O
, O
heated O
and O
in O
eager O
conversation O
, O
took O
off O
their O
coats O
, O
threw O
them O

      | O
loosely O
over O
their O
arms O
, O
and O
proceeded O
on O
their O
walk O
without O
them O
, O
much O
too O
engrossed O
with O
|
      | O
each O
other O
to O
be O
aware O
that O
, O
as O
they O
carried O
their O
coats O
, O
it O
was O
the O
easiest O
and O
most O
natural O

      | O
thing O
possible O
for O
all O
the O
smaller O
contents O
of O
their O
pockets O
to O
fall O
out O
, O
and O
if O
not O
missed O

      | O
directly O
, O
from O
the O
winding O
and O
rugged O
wood O

, O
not O
likely O
to O

again O

A O
draught O
of O

half B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour I-TIME

rest O
at O
Mrs. O
Langford B-PERSON

cottage O
sufficiently O
revived O
|
      | O
Robert B-PERSON
to O
resume O
his O
coat O
  O
he O
satisfied O
himself O
that O
his O
packet O
of O
papers O
was O
secure O
, O
and O
, O
as O
|
      | O
he O
imagined O
from O
the O
feel O
of O
another O
pocket O
, O
the O
pocket O
- O
book O
also O
. O

  | O
What O
, O
then O
, O
was O
his O
consternation O
, O
when O
he O
approached O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
house O
at O
which O
he O
was O
to O
|
      | O
leave O
ten B-QUANTITY
pounds I-QUANTITY
of O
the O
money O
, O
about B-QUANTITY
twenty I-QUANTITY
miles I-QUANTITY
from O
Oakwood B-ORG
to O
discover O
that O
the O
pocket O
|
      | O
book O
was O
gone O
! O
and O
that O
which O
, O
by O
its O
feel O
, O
he O
believed O
to O
have O
been O
it O
, O
an O
old O
card O
- O
case O
, O
|
      | O
that O
his O
young O
master O
Percy B-PERSON
had O
laughingly O
thrown O
at O
him O
one O
day O
after O
failing O
in O
his O
endeavor O
|
      | O
to O
emblazon O
it O
, O
the O
sticky O
materials O
he O
had O
used O
causing O
it O
to O
adhere O
to O
whatever O
it O
touched O
, O
|
      | O
and O
so O
preserving O
it O
in O
Robert B-PERSON
's O
pocket O
, O
when O
almost O
all O
the O
other O
things O
had O
fallen O
out O
. O
He O
|
      | O
racked O
his O
memory O
in O
vain O
as O
to O
what O
could O
have O
become O
of O
it O
, O
convinced O
that O
he O
had O
not O
left O
|
      | O
it O
at O
Oakwood B-ORG
, O
as O
he O
first B-ORDINAL
sincerely O
wished O
that O
he O
had O
. O
Two B-CARDINAL
or O
three B-CARDINAL
other O
things O
had O
also O
|
      | O
disappeared O
, O
and O
it O
suddenly O
flashed O
upon O
him O
, O
that O
when O
carrying O
his O
coat O
over O
his O
arm O
they O
|
      | O
must O
have O
fallen O
out O
. O
He O
cursed O
his O
thoughtlessness O
again O
and O
again O
, O
and O
would O
have O
retraced O
|
      | O
his O
steps O
immediately O
, O
but O
the O
papers O
with O
which O
he O
was O
intrusted O
had O
to O
be O
delivered O
at O
|
      | O
Plymouth B-ORG
by O
a B-TIME
certain I-TIME
hour I-TIME
, O
and O
he O
could O
not O
do O
it O
. O
The O
intense O
heat O
of O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
gave O
place O
in O
|
      | O
the B-TIME
evening I-TIME
to O
a O
tremendous O
storm O
of O
thunder O
and O
lightning O
, O
wind O
and O
very O
heavy O
rain O
, O
which O
|
      | O
last O
continued O
unabated O
through O
the B-TIME
night I-TIME
. O
He O
returned O
home O
, O
or O
rather O
to O
his O
mother O
's O
|
      | O
cottage O
, O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
in O
a O
state O
of O
mind O
little O
removed O
from O
distraction O
  O
searching O
the O
path O
|
      | O
he O
had O
traversed O
with O
his O
cousin O
in O
every O
direction O
, O
but O
only O
succeeded O
in O
finding O
some O
|
      | O
worthless O
trifles O
, O
and O
the O
pocket O
- O
book O
itself O
but O
open O
and O
empty O
  O
but O
at O
a O
little O
distance O
|
      | O
from O
it O
one B-QUANTITY
five I-QUANTITY
pound I-QUANTITY
note O
. O
In O
an O
instant O
he O
remembered O
that O
in O
his O
hurry O
he O
had O
failed O
to O
|
      | O
see O
to O
its O
proper O
fastening O
: O
if O
he O
had O
, O
all O
would O
have O
been O
right O
, O
for O
the O
wind O
and O
rain O
would O
|
      | O
hardly O
have O
had O
power O
to O
open O
it O
, O
and O
disperse O
its O
contents O
. O
Hour B-TIME
after I-TIME
hour I-TIME
he O
passed O
in O
the O
|
      | O
vain O
search O
for O
the O
remainder O
  O
the O
storm O
had O
rendered O
the O
path O
more O
intricate O
  O
the O
ground O
was O
|
      | O
slimy O
, O
and O
quantities O
of O
dried O
sticks O
and O
broken O
branches O
and O
leaves O
almost O
covered O
it O
. O
He O
|
      | O
told O
his O
tale O
to O
his O
mother O
in O
the O
deepest O
distress O
  O
what O
was O
he O
to O
do O
? O
She O
advised O
him O
to O
|
      | O
tell O
the O
steward O
the O
whole O
story O
, O
and O
to O
request O
him O
to O
keep O
back O
the O
sum O
she O
was O
in O
the O
habit O
|
      | O
of O
receiving O
quarterly B-DATE
, O
till O
the O
whole O
amount O
could O
be O
repaid O
. O
Robert B-PERSON
obeyed O
her O
, O
but O
with O
|
      | O
most O
painful O
reluctance O
, O
though O
even O
then O
he O
did O
not O
imagine O
all O
the O
misery O
his O
carelessness O
|
      | O
would O
entail O
upon O
him O
. O
Morris B-PERSON
, O
as O
was O
natural O
, O
was O
exceedingly O
displeased O
, O
and O
not O
only O
|
      | O
reproved O
him O
very O
severely O
, O
but O
let O
fall O
suspicions O
as O
to O
the O
truth O
of O
his O
story O
: O
he O
knew O
|
      | O
nothing O
of O
his O
cousin O
, O
he O
said O
, O
and O
could O
not O
say O
what O
company O
he O
might O
have O
been O
led O
into O
. O
If O
|
      | O
the O
notes O
had O
fallen O
out O
of O
his O
pocket O
during O
his O
walk O
, O
they O
must O
be O
found O
  O
it O
was O
all O
|
      | O
nonsense O
that O
the O
wind O
and O
rain O
could O
so O
have O
scattered O
and O
annihilated O
them O
, O
as O
to O
remove O
all O
|
      | O
trace O
of O
them O
. O
He O
would O
not O
say O
any O
thing O
to O
his O
master O
, O
because O
it O
would O
only O
annoy O
him O
, O
and O
|
      | O
the O
charities O
he O
would O
give O
himself O
, O
not O
from O
Mrs. O
Langford B-PERSON
's O
allowance O
, O
but O
from O
Robert B-PERSON
's O
own O

      | O
wages O
, O
which O
he O
should O
certainly O
stop O
till O
the O
whole O
sum O
was O
paid O
  O
he O
should O
take O
care O
how O
he O

      | O
intrusted O
such O
a O
responsible O
office O
to O
him O
again O
. O
| 
  | O
Robert B-PERSON
was O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
indignant O
, O
and O
violent O
in O
his O
protestations O
of O
the O
truth O
of O
his O
story O
  O
|
      | O
but O
as O
it O
got O
wind O
in O
the O
servants O
' O
hall O
as O
he O
found O
himself O
suspected O
and O
shunned O
by O
almost O

      | O
all O
, O
as O
days O
merged O
into O
weeks B-DATE
, O

there O
was O
no O

Morris B-PERSON

Ellis B-PERSON
both O

      | O
united O
in O
declaring O

no O
strangers O
passed O
through O
that O
part O
of O
the O
park O

if O
found O
they O

      | O
must O
have O
been O
heard O

, O
the O
young O
man O
sunk O
into O
a O
state O
of O
the O
most O
gloomy O
despondency O
, O
|
      | O
longing O
to O
tell O
his O
kind O
master O
the O
whole O
tale O
, O
and O
yet O
, O
naturally O
enough O
, O
shrinking O
from O
the O
|
      | O
dread O
of O
his O
suspicion O
of O
his O
honesty O
, O
as O
more O
terrible O
than O
all O
the O
rest O
. O
| 
  | O
But O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
did O
not O
suspect O
him O
, O
and O
so O
assured O
him O
of O
his O
firm O
belief O
in O
his O
truth O
and O
|
      | O
innocence O
, O
that O
it O
was O
with O
great O
difficulty O
poor O
Robert B-PERSON
refrained O
from O
throwing O
himself O
at O

      | O
his O
feet O
to O
pour O
forth O
his O
gratitude O
. O
He O
was O
so O
severely O
punished O
from O
his O
heedlessness O
, O
that O
|
      | O
his O
master O
would O
not O
say O
much O
about O
it O
, O
and O
soon O
after O
dismissing O
him O
, O
summoned O
Morris B-PERSON
, O
and O
|
      | O
talked O
with O
him O
some O
time O
on O
the O
subject O
, O
declaring O
he O
would O
as O
soon O
suspect O
his O
own O
son O
of O
|
      | O
dishonesty O
as O
the O
boy O
who O
had O
grown O
up O
under O

from O
infancy O
, O

the O
son O
of O
such O
a O

      | O
mother O

It O
was O
very O
distressing O
for O
Mrs. O

certainly O
, O
the O
old O
steward O
allowed O
, O
and O
she O

      | O
looked O
sad O
enough O
  O

it O
was O
no O

tried O
hard O
enough O
to O
prevent O
his O
suspicions O
, O
but O
|
      | O
they O
would O
come O
. O
None O
but O
the O
servants O
and O
the O
woodmen O
and O
gardeners O
went O
that O
path O
, O
and O
if O
|
      | O
the O
notes O
had O
been O
dropped O
there O
, O
they O
must O
have O
been O
found O
  O
and O
it O
was O
a O
very O
hard O
thing O
for O
|
      | O
the O
other O
servants O
, O
as O
none O
knew O
who O
might O
be O
suspected O
of O
appropriating O
them O
. O
His O
master O
was O
|
      | O
much O
too O
kind O
in O
his O
opinions O
, O
but O
he O
must O
forgive O
him O
if O
he O
continued O
to O
keep O
a O
sharp O
look O
|
      | O
out O
after O
the O
young O
man O
. O
Morris B-PERSON
was O
very O
old O
, O
and O
somewhat O
opinionated O
  O
so O
all O
that O
his O
master O
|
      | O
could O
succeed O
in O
, O
was O
to O
insist O
that O
he O
should O
only O
keep O
back O
half B-CARDINAL
of O
Robert B-PERSON
's O
wages O
, O
till O
the O
|
      | O
sum O
was O
paid O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Take O
away O
the O
whole O
, O
and O
if O
he O
have O
been O
unfortunately O
led O
into O
temptation O
, O
which O
I O
do O
not O
|
      | O
believe O
he O
has O
, O
you O
expose O
him O
to O
it O
again O
, O
" O
was O
his O
judicious O
command O
. O
" O
It O
is O
all O
right O
he O
|
      | O
should O
return O
it O
, O
even O
though O
lost O
only O
by O
carelessness O
  O
but O
I O
will O
not O
have O
him O
put O
to O
such O
|
      | O
straits O
for O
want O
of O
a O
little O
money O
, O
as O
must O
be O
the O
case O
if O
you O
deprive O
him O
of O
all O
his O
wages O
  O
|
      | O
and O
now O
, O
my O
good O
Morris B-PERSON
, O
if O
you O
can O
not O
in O
conscience O
repeat O
my O
firm O
opinion O
of O
this O
lad O
's O
|
      | O
innocence O
to O
the O
servants O
, O
I O
must O
do O
it O
myself O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
And O
that O
very O
evening B-TIME
after O
prayers O
, O
when O
the O
whole O
household O
were O
assembled O
in O
the O
library O
, O
|
      | O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
addressed O
them O
simply O
and O
briefly O
, O
mentioning O
that O
Robert B-PERSON
Langford I-PERSON
had O
himself O
|
      | O
told O
his O
tale O
to O
him O
, O
and O
that O
it O
was O
his O
own O
opinion O
, O
and O
that O
of O
their O
mistress O
, O
that O
he O
did O
|
      | O
not O
deserve O
the O
suspicions O
attached O
to O
him O
, O
and O
that O
his O
fellow O
- O
servants O
would O
all O
be O
acting O
|
      | O
more O
charitably O
and O
religiously O
if O
they O
believed O
his O
story O
, O
until O
they O
had O
had O
some O
strong O
|
      | O
proof O
to O
the O
contrary O
  O
he O
could O
not O
of O
course O
, O
interfere O
with O
private O
opinion O
  O
he O
could O
only O
|
      | O
tell O
them O
his O
own O
and O
their O
lady O
's O
. O
He O
acknowledged O
it O
was O
a O
very O
unpleasant O
occurrence O
, O
but O
|
      | O
he O
begged O
them O
all O
to O
dismiss O
the O
idea O
that O
suspicion O
could O
be O
attached O
to O
either O
of O
them O
  O
he O
|
      | O
felt O
too O
convinced O
that O
had O
any O
one O
of O
his O
household O
chanced O
to O
find O
the O
missing O
notes O
, O
they O
|
      | O
would O
at O
once O
have O
mentioned O
it O
to O
the O
steward O
or O
housekeeper O
, O
more O
especially O
, O
since O
Robert B-PERSON
's O
|
      | O
loss O
had O
been O
known O
among O
them O
only B-DATE
a I-DATE
few I-DATE
days I-DATE
after O
it O
had O
occurred O
. O
Appropriation O
, O
he O
need O
|
      | O
not O
tell O
them O
, O
in O
such O
a O
case O
was O
theft O
, O
and O
of O
that O
sin O
, O
he O
was O
perfectly O
certain O
, O
not O
one O
|
      | O
present O
would O
be O
guilty O
. O
He O
allowed O
that O
it O
would O
be O
much O
more O
satisfactory O
to O
have O
the O
|
      | O
tangible O
proof O
of O
Robert B-PERSON
's O
innocence O
by O
discovering O
some O
trace O
of O
them O
but O
it O
was O
not O
unlikely O
|
      | O
the O
heavy O
wind O
and O
rain O
had O
destroyed O
the O
thin O
material O
of O
the O
notes O
or O
borne O
them O
into O
the O
|
      | O
brambly O
brushwood O
, O
where O
it O
was O
scarcely O
possible O
they O
could O
be O
found O
. O
| 
  | O
If O
the O
attention O
of O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
her O
daughters O
, O
and O
Miss O
Harcourt B-PERSON
had O
not O
been O
naturally O
|
      | O
riveted O
on O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
's O
address O
, O
and O
its O
effect O
on O
the O
servants O
, O
especially O
Robert B-PERSON
, O
whose O
|
      | O
emotion O
was O
almost O
overpowering O
, O
they O
must O
have O
remarked O
that O
Ellen B-PERSON
had O
shrunk O
into O
the O
shade O
|
      | O
of O
the O
heavy O
curtains O
falling O
by O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
windows O
, O
and O
had O
unconsciously O
grasped O
the O
oaken O
|
      | O
back O
of O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
massive O
chairs O
  O
lips O
, O
cheek O
, O
and O
brow O
, O
white O
and O
rigid O
as O
sculptured O
|
      | O
marble O
. O
An O
almost O
supernatural O
effort O
alone O
enabled O
her O
to O
master O
the O
crushing O
agony O
, O
sending O
|
      | O
the O
blood O
up O
to O
her O
cheeks O
with O
such O
returning O
violence O
, O
that O
when O
she O
wished O
her O
aunt O
and O
|
      | O
uncle O
good O
night O
, O
she O
might O
have O
been O
thought O
more O
flushed O
than O
pale O
  O
but O
it O
passed O
unnoticed O
|
      | O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
too O
much O
annoyed O
on O
Mrs. O
Langford B-PERSON
's O
account O
, O
to O
think O
at O
that O
moment O
of O
any O
|
      | O
thing O
but O
how O
she O
could O
best O
set O
the O
poor O
mother O
's O
heart O
at O
rest O
. O
It O
was O
very O
evident O
that O
|
      | O
though O
some O
of O
the O
domestics O
after O
their O
master O
's O
address O
came O
up O
to O
Robert B-PERSON
, O
shook O
hands O
with O
|
      | O
him O
and O
begged O
his O
pardon O
, O
the O
greater O
number O
still O
sided O
with O
Morris B-PERSON
, O
and O
retained O
their O
own O
|
      | O
less O
favorable O
opinion O
, O
and O
she O
could O
well O
imagine O
what O
Mrs. O
Langford B-PERSON
's O
sufferings O
must O
be O
. O
It O
|
      | O
only O
wanted O
five B-DATE
days I-DATE
to O
that O
fixed O
for O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
's O
departure O
, O
wind O
permitting O
  O
and O
there O
|
      | O
were O
so O
many O
things O
to O
think O
of O
and O
do O
for O
him O
, O
that O
his O
family O
could O
have O
little O
thought O
of O
|
      | O
any O
thing O
else O
  O
but O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
assured O
her O
husband O
she O
would O
leave O
no O
means O
untried O
to O
|
      | O
prove O
Robert B-PERSON
's O
innocence O
. O
| 
  | O
For O
nearly B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour I-TIME
that O
same O
night O
did O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
after O
her O
attendant O
had O
left O
her O
, O
sit O
crouched O
|
      | O
by O
the O
side O
of O
her O
bed O
as O
if O
some O
bolt O
had O
struck O
and O
withered O
her O
as O
she O
sat O
. O
One B-CARDINAL
word O
alone O
|
      | O
sounded O
and O
resounded O
in O
her O
ears O
  O
she O
had O
known O
it O
, O
pronounced O
it O
to O
be O
such O
to O
herself O
|
      | O
numbers O
of O
times O
, O
but O
it O
had O
never O
mocked O
and O
maddened O
her O
as O
when O
spoken O
in O
her O
uncle O
's O
|
      | O
voice O
, O
and O
in O
his O
deepest O
, O
most O
expressive O
tone—"theft O
! O
" O
And O
she O
was O
the O
guilty O
one O
— O
and O
she O
|
      | O
must O
see O
the O
innocent O
bearing O
the O
penalty O
of O
her O
crime O
, O
suspicion O
, O
dislike O
, O
avoidance O
, O
for O
she O
|
      | O
dared O
not O
breathe O
the O
truth O
. O
Again O
came O
the O
wild O
, O
almost O
desperate O
, O
resolve O
to O
seek O
Mrs. O

      | O
Hamilton B-PERSON
that O
very O
moment O

avow O
herself O
the O
criminal O

implore O
her O
to O
take O
back O
every O
trinket O

      | O
belonging O
to O
her O
, O
to O
replace O
it O

do O
with O
her O
what O
she O
would O

But O
if O
she O
did O
confess O
, O
and O
|
      | O
so O
draw O
attention O
to O
her O
, O
how O
could O
she O
keep O
her O

Could O
she O
have O
firmness O
to O

bear O
all O

rather O
than O
betray O
it O
? O
What O
proof O
of O
her O
inward O
wretchedness O
and O
remorse O
could O
there O

      | O
be O
in O
the O
mere O
confession O

all O

the O

about B-DATE

up O

there O
was O
something O

you O
can O

too O

whose O
compelled O
absence O
really O
regret O
too O
much O

so O
think O
of O
him O
, O
as O

pray O

continually O
in O
spirit O
to O
your O

so O
prosper O
his O

as O
to O
permit O
his O
return O
to O
us O

we O
at O

expect O

The O
very O
constant O
prayer O
for O
this O

will O
make O
you O
rest O

secure O

happy O

the O
belief O

that O
our O

he O
is O

as O
He O
is O
with O

give O
you O
cheerfulness O

      | O
message O
from O
her O
aunt O
to O
the O
widow O
  O
and O
as O
the O
girls O
were O
often O
allowed O
and O
encouraged O
to O
|
      | O
visit O
their O
nurse O
, O
the O
request O
was O
granted O
without O
any O
surprise O
, O
though O
to O
the O
very O
last O
|
      | O
moment O
she O
feared O
one O
of O
her O
cousins O
or O
Miss O
Harcourt B-PERSON
would O
offer O
to O
accompany O
her O
. O
They O
were O

      | O
all O
, O
however O
, O
too O
occupied O
with O
and O
for O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
and O
she O
sought O
the O
cottage O
, O
and O
there O
, O
|
      | O
with O
such O
very O
evident O
mental O
agony O
, O
besought O
Mrs. O
Langford B-PERSON
to O
promise O
her O
secrecy O
and O
aid O
, O
|
      | O
that O
the O
widow O
, O
very O
much O
against O
her O
conscience O
, O
was O
won O
over O
to O
accede O
. O
She O
was O
in O
most O
|
      | O
pressing O
want O
of O
money O
, O
she O
urged O
, O
and O
dared O
not O
appeal O
to O
her O
aunt O
. O
Not O
daring O
to O
say O
the O
|
      | O
whole O
amount O
which O
she O
so O
urgently O
required O
at O
once O
, O
she O
had O
only O
brought O
with O
her O
the O
antique O
|
      | O
gold O
cross O
and O
two B-CARDINAL
or O
three B-CARDINAL
smaller O
ornaments O
, O
which O
had O
been O
among O
her O
mother O
's O
trinkets O
, O
and O
|
      | O
a O
gold O
locket O
Percy B-PERSON
had O
given O
her O
. O
Mrs. O
Langford B-PERSON
was O
painfully O
startled O
. O
She O
had O
no O
idea O
her O
|
      | O
promise O
comprised O
acquiescence O
and O
assistance O
in O
any O
matter O
so O
very O
wrong O
and O
mysterious O
as O
|
      | O
this O
  O
and O
she O
tried O
every O
argument O
, O
every O
persuasion O
, O
to O
prevail O
on O
Ellen B-PERSON
to O
confide O
all O
her O
|
      | O
difficulties O
to O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
urging O
that O
if O
even O
she O
had O
done O
wrong O
, O
it O
could O
only O
call O
for O
|
      | O
temporary O
displeasure O
, O
whereas O
the O
mischief O
of O
her O
present O
proceeding O
might O
never O
come O
to O
an O
|
      | O
end O
, O
and O
must O
be O
discovered O
at O
last O
  O
but O
Ellen B-PERSON
was O
inexorable O
, O
though O
evidently O
quite O
as O
|
      | O
miserable O
as O
she O
was O
firm O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Langford B-PERSON
had O
too O
high O
an O
idea O
of O
the O
solemn O
nature O
of O
a O
|
      | O
pledged O
word O
to O
draw O
back O
, O
or O
think O
of O
betraying O
her O
. O
She O
said O
that O
, O
of O
course O
, O
it O
might O
be O
|
      | O
some B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
before O
she O
could O
succeed O
in O
disposing O
of O
them O
all O
  O
as O
to O
offer O
them O
all O
together O
, O
|
      | O
or O
even O
at O
one B-CARDINAL
place O
, O
would O
be O
exposing O
herself O
to O
the O
most O
unpleasant O
suspicions O
. O
| 
  | O
One B-CARDINAL
step O
was O
thus O
gained O
, O
but O
nearly O
a O
fortnight O
had O
passed O
, O
and O
she O
heard O
nothing O
from O
the O
|
      | O
widow O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Will O
they O
never O
come O
? O
" O
exclaimed O
Emmeline B-PRODUCT
, O
in O
mirthful O
impatience O
, O
one B-TIME
evening I-TIME
, O
about B-CARDINAL
four I-CARDINAL
|
      | O
days O
after O
her O
conversation O
with O
her O
mother O
  O
" O
it O

must O
be O
|  | O
past O
the O
hour O
Percy B-PERSON

      | O
named O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
It O
still O
wants O
half B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour I-TIME
, O
" O
replied O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
  O
adding O
, O
" O
that O
unfortunate O
drawing O
, O
|
      | O
when O
will O
it O
succeed O
in O
obtaining O
your O
undivided O
attention O
? O
" O

  | O
" O
Certainly O
not O
this B-TIME
evening I-TIME
, O
mamma O
  O
the O
only O
drawing O
I O
feel O
inclined O
for O
, O
is O
a O
sketch O
of O
my O
|
      | O
two B-CARDINAL
brothers O
, O
if O
they O
would O
only O
have O
the O
kindness O
to O
sit O
by O
me O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Poor O
Percy O
, O
" O
observed O
Caroline B-GPE
, O
dryly O
  O
" O
if O
you O
are O
to O
be O
as O
restless O
as O
you O
have O
been O
the O
|
      | O
last B-TIME
hour I-TIME
, O
Emmeline B-PERSON
, O
he O
would O
not O
be O
very O
much O
flattered O
by O
his O
portrait O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Now O
that O
is O
very O
spiteful O
of O
you O
, O
Caroline B-PERSON
, O
and O
all O
because O
I O
do O
not O
happen O
to O
be O
so O
quiet O
|
      | O
and O
sober O
as O
you O
are O
  O
though O
I O
am O
sure O
all O
this O
morning O
, O
that O
mamma O
thought O
by O
your O
unusually O
|
      | O
long O
absence O
that O
you O
were O
having O
a O
most O
persevering O
practice O
, O
you O
were O
only O
collecting O
all O
|
      | O
Percy B-PERSON
's O
and O
Herbert B-PERSON
's O
favorite O
songs O
and O
pieces O
, O
and O
playing O
them O
over O
, O
instead O
of O
your O
new O

      | O
music O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
And O
what O
if O
I O
did O
, O
Emmeline B-PERSON
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Why O
, O
it O
only O
proves O
that O
your O
thoughts O
are O
quite O
as O
much O
occupied O
by O
them O
as O
mine O
are O
, O

      | O
though O
you O
have O
so O
disagreeably O
read O
, O
studied O
, O
worked O
, O
just O
as O
usual O
, O
to O
make O
one O
believe O
you O

      | O
neither O
thought O
nor O
cared O
any O
thing O
about O
them O
. O
" O
|

" O
And O
so O
, O
because O
Caroline B-GPE
can O
control O
even O
joyous O
anticipation O
, O
she O
is O
to O
be O
thought O
void O
of O

      | O
feeling O
, O
Emmy B-PERSON
. O
I O
really O
can O
pronounce O
no O
such O
judgment O
  O
so O
, O
though O
she O
may O
have O
settled O
to O
her O

      | O
usual O
pursuits O

you O
have O
literally O
done O
nothing O

all O

- O
day O

I O
will O
not O
condemn O
her O

loving O

less O

you O

Emmeline B-PRODUCT

      | O
kneeling O
on O
the O
ottoman O
at O
her O

      | O
do O

me O

not O

Ellen B-PERSON

away O

" O
It O

Ellen B-PERSON

been O
so O
perseveringly O
industrious O

her O
illness O

that O
I O

      | O
should O
rather O
condemn O

too O
great O
idleness O

you O

stooping O
too O
long O

warm O
evening B-TIME

she O
added O
, O
observing O
, O
as O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
it O

      | O
seemed O
almost O
involuntarily O

looked O
up O
at O
her O
cousin O

words O

that O

almost O
painfully O

day O

have O
been O
more O
silent O

      | O
since O
your O
uncle O

" O
|

There O
was O
no O
rejoinder O
to O
these O
kind O

playful O
words O

Ellen B-PERSON
did O
indeed O
put O
aside O
her O

drawing O

taking O
a O
seat O

aunt O

days O
she O
would O
have O
been O

      | O
only O
too O
happy O

walked O

ensconcing O
herself O
in O
its O
deep O

      | O
recess O
, O
seemed O
determined O
to O
hold O
communion O

no O

Miss O
Harcourt B-PERSON
was O
so O
indignant O

      | O
scarcely O
to O
be O
able O
to O
contain O
its O
expression O

Caroline B-PERSON
looked O
astonished O

provoked O

      | O
Emmeline B-ORG

busy O

Several O

the O

brought O
them O
all O
to O
the O

she O
was O
right O

a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes I-TIME

horseman O
emerged O

urging O
his O
horse O

its O

" O
| 
  | O
Ellen B-PERSON
answered O
, O
almost O
inarticulately O
, O
it O
was O
not O

interrupted O
Mrs. O

startled O
out O
of O
all O

that O

was O
changed O
only O
in O

      | O
fancy O

| 
  | O
Ellen B-PERSON
was O
silent O
, O
and O
to O
Percy B-PERSON
's O
imagination O
, O
so O
sullenly O
and O
insolently O
so O
, O
that O
he O
became O

      | O
indignant O

" O

you O

you O

she O
at O

not O

Percy B-PERSON

his O
eyes O
flashing O
with O
such O
unusual O
anger O

it O
terrified O

still O
more O

under O

the O

of O

never O

not O
even O
when O
the O

      | O
disappearance O
of O

extreme O
displeasure O

evinced O
such O
an O

      | O
apparently O
sullen O
spirit O
of O
determined O
hardihood O

She O
would O
not O

falsehood O

what O
she O

Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
spoke O
to O
her O
till O
she O
was O
almost O
|
      | O
exhausted O
, O
for O
her O
own O
disappointment O
was O
most O
painful O

she O
had O
not O
a O
gleam O
of O
hope O
to O

      | O
urge O
her O
on O

Her O
concluding O
words O
were O
these O
— O

" O
That O
you O

fault O

Ellen B-PERSON
, O
I O

      | O
am O
perfectly O
convinced O
  O
what O
it O
is O
time O

I O
give O
you O
one B-DATE

decide O

your O

      | O
course O

confess O
whatever O
error O
you O
may O
have O
been O
led O

      | O
into O

and O
so O
change O
your O
conduct O

so O
loved O
, O

      | O
faults O

I O

I O
find O
you O

      | O
persisting O
in O
the O

course O

rebellion O

defiance O

your O
duty O

your O

      | O
God O

to O
me O

I O
shall O
adopt O
some O
measures O

more O

you O

She O
had O
left O
the O

that O

there O
was O
no O

she O
could O
not O

in O
anger O

Yet O
it O
was O

just O
  O
it O

better O

perhaps O

sat O

stupor O

crept O
over O
her O

she O
knew O
that O
it O

never O
satisfy O

the O
half O

very O
far O
away O

      | O
next O

impossible O

that O

Mr. O

the O

had O
told O
them O
to O
his O

it O
seemed O
curious O

in O

certain O
matters O
relative O

demanded O
a O
reference O

Ellen B-PERSON

chosen O

decision O

so O
contrary O

usual O
habits O

that O
Mrs. O

could O

prevent O

nothing O

If O

what O

She O
knew O
there O
would O
be O
a B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL

cry O
shame O

her O
for O

Mrs. O

called O

      | O
Robert B-PERSON

proceeded O
to O
the O
school O

room O
to O
get O
a O
pattern O
of O
embroidery O
and O
a O
note O

which O

      | O
Caroline B-GPE

the O
pattern O

some O

she O
had O
neglected O
to O
put O
up O
till O
her O
brothers O
were O
ready O
, O

|
      | O
they O
so O
hurried O
her O

Robert B-PERSON
loosened O
a O

it O
fell O
to O
the O

with O
such O
force O

only O
covered O
his O
face O

suspicion O

turn O

her O

enough O
in O

the O
terrified O
beholder O
with O
such O
a O

      | O
sensation O
of O

that O
had O

one B-TIME

gone O
forward O

even O

the O
words O

" O
I O
desired O

she O
walked O
the O
whole O
length O
of O

interminable O
room O

stood O
facing O
her O

| 
  | O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
for O
a O
full O
minute O
did O
not O
speak O
, O
but O
she O
fixed O
that O
searching O
look O

to O
which O

      | O
we O
have O
once O
before O
alluded O
, O
upon O
Ellen B-PERSON

face O
  O
and O
then O
said O
, O
in O
a O
tone O
which O
, O
though O
very O
|
      | O
low O
and O
calm O
, O
expressed O
as O
much O
as O
that O
earnest O
look O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
Ellen O
! O
is O
it O
necessary O
for O
me O
to O
tell O
you O
why O
you O
are O
here O
— O
necessary O
to O
produce O
the O
proof O

      | O
that O
my O
words O
are O
right O
, O
and O
that O
you O

been O
influenced O
by O
the O
fearful O
effects O
of O

      | O
some O
unconfessed O
and O
most O
heinous O
sin O
? O
Little O
did O
I O
dream O
its O
nature O

" O
| 
  | O
For O
a O
moment O
Ellen B-PERSON
stood O
as O
turned O
to O
stone O
, O
as O
white O
and O
rigid O
— O
the O
next O
she O
had O
sunk O
down O
, O
|
      | O
with O
a O
wild O
, O
bitter O
cry O
at O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
's O
feet O
, O
and O
buried O
her O
face O
in O
her O
hands O

" O
Is O
it O
true O

cherished O
by O
me O

      | O
as O
my O

you O
have O
been O
the O
guilty O
one O
to O
appropriate O
, O
and O
conceal O
the O
appropriation O
of O

      | O
money O
, O
which O
has O
been O
a O
source O
of O

suspicion O

seven I-DATE
weeks?—that O
you O
could O
listen O
to O
your O
uncle O

words O

absolving O
his O
whole O

      | O
household O
as O
incapable O
of O
a O
deed O

was O

yet O
, O
by O
neither O
word O

      | O
betray O
remorse O

guilt?—could O
behold O
the O
innocent O

the O
fearful O
misery O
of O
suspicion O
, O

without O
the O
power O

stand O
calmly O

heedlessly O
by O
— O
only O

      | O
proving O
by O
your O
hardened O

rebellious O
temper O
that O
all O
was O
not O
right O

— O
Ellen B-PERSON

be O
true O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Yes O
! O
" O
was O
the O
reply O
, O
but O
with O
such O
a O
fearful O
effort O
, O
that O
her O
slight O
frame O
shook O
as O
with O
an O

      | O
ague O
  O
" O
thank O
God O

that O

" O
This O
is O
mere O
mockery O
, O
Ellen B-PERSON
  O
how O
dare O
I O
believe O
even O
this O
poor O
evidence O
of O
repentance O
, O
with O

      | O
the O
recollection O
of O
your O
past O
conduct O

found O

one O

" O
| 
  | O
Ellen B-PERSON

answer O
was O
scarcely O
audible O

" O
Used O
them O

for O
what O

" O
| 
  | O
There O
was O
no O

neither O
then O
, O

when O
Mrs. O

sternly O
reiterated O
the O
question O

      | O
She O
then O
demanded O
— O

" O

possession O

" O
| 
  | O
" O
Five B-DATE
or I-DATE
six I-DATE
weeks I-DATE

" O
but O
the O
reply O
was O
so O
tremulous O
, O
it O
carried O
no O
conviction O
with O
it O
. O

" O
Before O

" O

  | O
" O
Then O
your O
last O
answer O
was O
a O
falsehood O

Ellen B-PERSON
  O
it O
is O
full O
seven B-DATE
weeks I-DATE

my O
husband O

      | O
addressed O
the O
household O
on O
the O
subject O

miscounted O
time O

deed O

did O
you O
find O
them O

Ellen B-PERSON
described O
the O
spot O

had O
you O
there O

you O
forgotten O
it O

She O
crouched O
lower O
at O
her O
aunt O

the O

was O
audible O

      | O
crushing O
her O
to O
the O
earth O

but O
every O
answered O
and O
unanswered O
question O
but O
deepened O
the O

      | O
mystery O
, O

rendered O
her O
judge O

task O
more O
difficult O

" O

But O
she O
asked O
in O
vain O
. O
Ellen B-PERSON
remained O
moveless O
, O
and O
silent O
as O
the O
dead O

  | O
After O
several B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
removed O
her O
hands O
from O
her O
face O
, O
and O
compelling O
her O
to O
|
      | O
lift O
up O
her O
head O
  O
gazed O
searchingly O
on O
her O
deathlike O
countenance O
for O
some O
moments O
in O
utter O
|
      | O
silence O
, O
and O
then O
said O
, O
in O
a O
tone O
that O
Ellen B-PERSON
never O
in O
her O
life O
forgot O
— O

" O
You O

not O
imagine O

that O
this O
half O

will O
either O
satisfy O
me O

or O
in O
the O

      | O
smallest O
degree O
redeem O
your O
sin O

One B-CARDINAL
and O
one B-CARDINAL
only O
path O
is O
open O
to O
you O
  O
for O
all O
that O
you O
have O

      | O
said O
and O
left O
unsaid O
but O
deepens O
your O
apparent O
guilt O
, O
and O
so O
blackens O
your O
conduct O
, O
that O
I O
can O

      | O
scarcely O
believe O
I O
am O
addressing O
the O
child O
I O
so O
loved O

could O
still O
so O
love O

one B-CARDINAL
real O

given O
of O
remorse O

penitence O

But O
that O
sign O
, O
that O
hope O

      | O
can O
only O
be O
a O
full O

Terrible O
as O
is O
the O
guilt O

appropriating O
so O
large O

additional O
sin O

      | O
concealment O

an O
innocent O
person O
was O
suffering O

something O
still O
darker O

more O
terrible O

      | O
lie O
concealed O

you O
would O
not O

continue O
thus O
obdurately O
silent O

believe O
that O
under O
some O
heavy O
pressure O
of O
misery O

some O
strong O
excitement O
, O
the O
sum O
might O

been O
used O
without O

that O
fear O
might O
have O
prevented O
the O
confession O

any O
thing O
so O

      | O
dreadful O
  O
but O
what O
was O
this O
heavy O
necessity O

What O
fearful O

mysterious O
difficulties O

you O

Tell O
me O
the O
truth O

the O
whole O

me O

some O

saving O
you O

the O
misery O

publicly O

      | O
declaring O
you O

Tell O
me O
what O
difficulty O

what O

      | O
misery O
so O
maddened O
you O

full O
confession O

every O
question O

I O
put O
to O

be O
clearly O

was O
the O

such O
bitter O
anguish O

Mrs. O

actually O
shuddered O

repeated O
Mrs. O

more O

the O
emotion O

Ellen B-PERSON

wild O
words O

incongruous O

painful O
thoughts O
floating O
through O
her O
brain O

resource O

by O
his O

Ellen B-PERSON

The O
more O
she O
thought O
, O
the O
more O
agonizing O
her O

      | O
thoughts O
became O
  O
what O
could O
induce O
this O
determined O
silence O

but O
a O
conviction O
of O
deeper O
guilt O
, O
|
      | O
and O
what O
could O
that O
guilt O
be O
? O
The O
most O
terrible O
suspicions O
crossed O
her O
mind O
  O
she O
had O
heard O
, O
|
      | O
though O
she O
had O
scarcely O
believed O
in O
them O
, O
of O
entanglements O
, O
even O
where O
the O
guardianship O
had O
|
      | O
been O
most O
rigid O
. O
Could O
one O
so O
young O
, O
seemingly O
so O
innocent O
, O
have O
fallen O
into O
the O
power O
of O
some O
|
      | O
desperate O
character O
, O
who O
was O
working O
on O
her O
thus O
? O
How O
could O
she O
be O
sure O
she O
intended O
to O
take O
|
      | O
her O
trinkets O
to O
Mrs. O
Langford B-PERSON
? O
Her O
choosing O
that O
forbidden O
path O
which O
was O
never O
by O
any O
chance O
|
      | O
trodden O
by O
the O
family O
or O
their O
friends O
, O
her O
constant O
desire O
lately O
not O
to O
join O
them O
in O
their O
|
      | O
excursions O
, O
preferring O
, O
and O
often O
finding O
some O
excuse O
to O
remain O
alone O
— O
all O
came O
to O
Mrs. O
|
      | O
Hamilton B-PERSON
's O
mind O
, O
with O
such O
an O
overpowering O
sensation O
of O
dread O
and O
misery O
, O
that O
the O
worst O
guilt O
|
      | O
Ellen B-PERSON
could O
have O
avowed O
would O
scarcely O
have O
been O
worse O
than O
anticipation O
pictured O
  O
and O
yet O
|
      | O
every O
thought O
was O
so O
vague O
, O
every O
fancy O
so O
undefined O
— O
there O
was O
nothing O
she O
could O
grasp O
at O
as O
a O
|
      | O
saving O
hope O
, O
or O
in O
the O
remotest O
degree O
excusing O
cause O
  O
such O
obdurate O
silence O
in O
one O
so O
young O
, O
|
      | O
generally O
so O
yielding O
, O
could O
and O
must O
conceal O
nothing O
but O
still O
more O
fearful O
sin O
. O
The O
darkness O
|
      | O
which O
had O
gathered O
round O
them O
, O
save O
the O
brightening O
light O
of O
the O
harvest O
moon O
, O
suddenly O
|
      | O
awakened O
her O
to O
the O
lapse O
of O
time O
. O
The O
moonlight O
fell O
full O
on O
the O
face O
of O
the O
watch O
, O
which O
was O
|
      | O
a O
repeater O
. O
It O
wanted O
but O
three B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
more O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
watched O
the O
progress O
of O
the O
|
      | O
hand O
with O
such O
sickening O
dread O
, O
that O
when O
it O
reached O
the B-TIME
hour I-TIME
, O
she O
had O
scarcely O
strength O
to O
|
      | O
strike O
it O
, O
and O
so O
give O
notice O
— O
for O
words O
she O
had O
none O
— O
that O
the B-TIME
hour I-TIME
of O
grace O
had O
passed O
. O
But O
|
      | O
she O
conquered O
the O
powerlessness O
, O
and O
those O
soft O
chimes O
, O
which O
, O
when O
Ellen B-PERSON
first B-ORDINAL
came O
to O
|
      | O
Oakwood B-ORG
, O
had O
been O
such O
a O
constant O
source O
of O
childish O
wonder O
and O
delight O
, O
now O
rang O
in O
her O
ears O
|
      | O
louder O
, O
hoarser O
, O
more O
fearfully O
distinct O
, O
than O
even O
those O
of O
the O
ancient O
time O
- O
piece O
in O
the O

      | O
hall O
, O
which O
at O
the O
same O
moment O
rang O
out O
the B-TIME
hour I-TIME
of I-TIME
eight I-TIME
. O
| 
  | O
The O
sound O
ceased O
, O
and O
with O
heightened O
dignity O
, O
but O
in O
perfect O
silence O

Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
rose O
, O

      | O
passed O
her O

nearly O
reached O
the O
door O

when O
she O
paused O
, O

turned O
toward O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O

      | O
as O

Ellen B-PERSON
's O
eyes O
had O
watched O
her O
as O
in O
fascination O
, O
and O
the O
pause O
endowed O
her O

      | O
with O
just O
sufficient O
power O
to O
spring O
forward O

fling O
herself O
at O
her O

spot O

a O
vague O

cold O
terror O
so O
took O
possession O

her O

the O
room O

filled O
with O
ghostly O
shapes O

all O
the O
articles O

things O

up O

the O
wild O

fleet O
step O

It O
was O
such O
a O
different O
scene O

such O
a O
fullness O
of O
innocent O
joy O

on O

Mrs. O

all O

the O
contrast O

almost O
overpowered O
her O

too O
, O
that O
the O
fatal O
effects O
of O
one B-CARDINAL

banish O

room O

loudly O

company O

of O

discursive O

Herbert B-PERSON

aloud O

his O
mother O

Miss O

had O
been O
too O
painfully O
startled O
by O
the O

      | O
unusual O
expression O
of O
forcibly O
- O
controlled O

so O
much O
to O

      | O
Percy B-PERSON
was O
in O
such O
wild O
spirits O
, O
that O
it O
was O
utterly O
impossible O
for O
there O
to O
be O
any O
thing O
like O

      | O
a O
pause O

Tea O
had O
always O
been O
a O
favorite O
meal O
at O
Oakwood B-ORG

as O
bringing O
all O

lingered O
over O
it O

      | O
usual O
, O
when O
Caroline B-PERSON
suddenly O
exclaimed O
— O

" O
What O
has O
become O
of O

Percy B-PERSON

half O

jesting O
, O
half B-CARDINAL
- O
earnest O

, O
for O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
changed O
manner O
to O
his O
mother O

      | O
had O
made O
him O
more O
angry O
with O
her O
, O
and O
for O
a O
longer O
time O
together O
, O
than O
he O
had O
ever O
been O
with O

      | O
any O
body O
, O
especially O
a O
woman O
, O
in O

life O

stretched O
out O
his O
hand O

, O
to O
ring O
the O

bell O

Mrs. O

stopped O
him O
. O

" O

your O
cousin O

not O

" O
she O
said O
  O
and O
her O
tone O
was O
now O
|
      | O
so O
expressive O
of O
almost O
anguish O
, O
that O
every O
one O
of O
that O
happy O
party O
startled O
and O
looked O
at O
her O

      | O
with O
the O
most O
unfeigned O
alarm O
, O
and O
Percy B-PERSON
, O
every O
thought O
of O
jest O
and O
joyousness O
checked O
, O
threw O

      | O
his O
arms O
round O
her O
, O
exclaiming O
— O

" O

! O
what O

happened?—that O

I O
am O
sure O

      | O
do O
you O
not O
cast O
her O
off O
from O
your O
heart O
at O

, O
how O
can O
you O
be O
so O
harsh?—how O

" O
exclaimed O
Emmeline B-PRODUCT
, O
indignantly O
, O
as O
Mrs. O

head O
, O
for O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
of O
natural O
weakness O

sunk O
on O
her O
son O

" O
We O

all O

cast O

off O

too O

for O
shame O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Hush O
! O
" O
answered O
Percy B-PERSON
, O
almost O
sternly O
, O
for O
there O
were O
times O
when O
he O
could O
quite O
throw O
off O

      | O
the O
boy O
. O
" O
This O
is O
no O
light O

send O

fondly O

my O

your O

can O

      | O
only O
feel O

" O
| 
  | O
But O
there O
are O
times O
when O
feeling O
can O
aid O
in O
bringing O
back O
control O
and O
strength O
, O
when O
counsel O

      | O
alone O
would O
seem O
so O
harsh O
and O
cold O
, O
we O
can O
only O
weep O
before O
it O
  O
and O
the O
fond O
affection O
of O
her O
|
      | O
children O
, O
the O
unusual O
assumption O
of O
protecting O
manliness O
in O
Percy B-PERSON
, O
so O
touchingly O
united O
with O
|
      | O
the O
deep O
respect O
that O
prevented O
the O
least O
intrusive O
question O
as O
to O
the O
cause O
of O
her O
distress O
|
      | O
till O
she O
chose O
to O
reveal O
it O
, O
gave O
her O
power O
to O
send O
back O
the O
tears O
that O
had O
escaped O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
|
      | O
so O
hot O
and O
fast O
, O
and O
though O
still O
holding O
his O
hand O
, O
as O
if O
its O
very O
pressure O
was O
support O
, O
she O
|
      | O
was O
enabled O
calmly O
to O
relate O
the O
fatal O
discovery O
of O
that O
evening O
. O
Its O
effect O
was O
, O
in O
truth O
, O
as O

      | O
if O
a O
thunderbolt O
had O
fallen O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
them O

An O
execration O
, O
forcibly O
checked O
, O

      | O
passionate O
as O
his O
nature O
, O
burst O
from O
the O
lips O
of O
Percy B-PERSON
, O
as O
he O
clamped O
his O
arm O
close O
round O

      | O
mother O
, O
as O
thus O
to O
protect O
her O
from O
the O
misery O

felt O
himself O

Herbert B-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
low O
cry O
of O

      | O
pain O
, O
buried O
his O
face O
in O
his O
hands O

Caroline B-PERSON
, O
shocked O

bewildered O
, O

her O
first B-ORDINAL
thought O

      | O
for O
her O
mother O
, O
could O
only O
look O
at O

feel O
for O
her O
, O
quite O
forgetting O
that O
her O
every O

      | O
prejudice O
against O
Ellen B-PERSON
did O
indeed O
seem O
fulfilled O

Emmeline O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
looked O
stunned O
, O
then O

      | O
sinking O
down O
at O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
's O
feet O
, O
hid O
her O
face O
on O
her O
lap O
, O
and O
sobbed O
with O
such O

      | O
uncontrolled O
violence O
, O
that O
it O
might O
have O
seemed O
as O
if O
she O
herself O
, O
not O
Ellen B-PERSON

the O
guilty O

of O
all O

misery O

Miss O
Harcourt B-PERSON
, O
like O

could O
only O
think O

feel O
for O
Mrs. O

knew O
so O
well O
all O

love O

Ellen B-PERSON

excited O

what O

Mrs. O

said O
, O
addressing O
Emmeline B-ORG
, O
after O
nearly B-DATE
a I-DATE
quarter I-DATE
of O

      | O
an B-TIME
hour I-TIME
had O
passed O
, O
and O
the O
various O
emotions O
of O
each O
individual O
had O
found O
vent O
in O
words O
well O

      | O
illustrative O
of O
their O
respective O
characters O
  O
all O
but O
Emmeline B-PERSON
who O
continued O
to O
sob O
so O

      | O
painfully O
, O
that O
her O
mother O
successfully O
forgot O
her O
own O
sorrow O
to O
comfort O
her O
. O
" O
Ellen B-PERSON
is O
still O

very O
young O
, O

giving O
us O
all O

misery O

by O

We O
must O
not O
give O
up O
all O
hope O

because O
now O
all O
my O
cares O
seem O
so O

      | O
blighted O

There O
is O
some O
fatal O
mystery O
attached O
to O
her O
conduct O

for O
I O
am O
indeed O
deceived O

rejoined O
Percy B-PERSON

impetuously O
  O
for O
when O
he O
found O
his O
mother O

      | O
resuming O
control O

firmness O

had O
given O
vent O
to O
his O
indignation O

striding O
hastily O
up O

down O

" O
What O

hardihood O

The O
next O
morning O
, O
when O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
had O
occasion O
to O
speak O
to O
Morris B-PERSON
about O
some O
farm O
|
      | O
receipts O
, O
which O
had O
not O
been O
forthcoming O
the B-DATE
preceding I-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
she O
recalled O
him O
as O
he O
was O
|
      | O
departing O
  O
but O
the O
words O
she O
had O
to O
say O
seemed O
unusually O
difficult O
, O
for O
her O
voice O
audibly O
|
      | O
faltered O
, O
and O
her O
face O
was O
completely O
shaded O
by O
her O
hand O
. O
It O
was O
simply O
to O
ask O
that O
which O
|
      | O
Morris B-PERSON
's O
loving O
reverence O
had O
already O
done O
  O
and O
when O
the O
old O
man O
, O
in O
those O
earnest O
accents O
of O
|
      | O
heartfelt O
respect O
and O
kindness O
which O
never O
can O
be O
mistaken O
, O
related O
what O
had O
passed O
, O
his O
|
      | O
mistress O
hastily O
extended O
her O
hand O
to O
him O
, O
saying O
, O
in O
a O
tone O
he O
never O
forgot O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
God O
bless O
you O
, O
Morris B-PERSON
! O
I O
ought O
to O
have O
known O
your O
love O
for O
your O
master O
's O
house O
would O
have O
|
      | O
urged O
this O
, O
without O
any O
request O
from O
me O
. O
I O
can O
not O
thank O
you O
enough O
. O
" O
The O
kiss O
he O
ventured O
to O
|
      | O
press O
upon O
the O
delicate O
hand O
which O
pressed O
his O
rough O
palm O
, O
was O
not O
unaccompanied O
, O
though O
he O
|
      | O
did O
force O
back O
the O
tear O
, O
and O
most O
respectfully O
, O
yet O
very O
earnestly O
, O
beseech O
his O
mistress O
not O
|
      | O
to O
take O
on O
too O
much O
. O
There O
must O
be O
some O
cause O
, O
some O
mystery O
  O
no O
one O
belonging O
to O
her O
could O
so O
|
      | O
have O
acted O
without O
some O
very O
fearful O
temptation O
, O
some O
very O
powerful O
reason O
, O
and O
it O
would O
all O
|
      | O
come O
straight O
one O
day O
. O
| 
  | O
But O
whatever O
the O
future O
, O
the O
present O
was O
only O
suffering O
  O
for O
, O
to O
obtain O
a O
full O
confession O
|
      | O
from O
Ellen B-GPE
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
felt O
so O
absolutely O
incumbent O
on O
her O
, O
that O
she O
steadily O
refused O
to O
|
      | O
listen O
to O
either O
pity O
or O
affection O
, O
which O
could O
shake O
her O
firmness O
  O
and O
the O
opinion O
and O
advice O
|
      | O
of O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
strengthened O
the O
determination O
. O
He O
had O
a O
private O
interview O
with O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
but O
it O
|
      | O
was O
attended O
with O
so O
very O
little O
success O
, O
that O
he O
left O
her O
far O
more O
bewildered O
and O
grieved O
|
      | O
than O
he O
had O
sought O
her O
  O
but O
fully O
convinced O
it O
was O
mere O
hardihood O
and O
obstinacy O
, O
which O
caused O
|
      | O
her O
incomprehensible O
and O
most O
guilty O
silence O
. O
Not O
even O
allowing O
, O
as O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
had O
, O
that O
|
      | O
there O
was O
any O
evidence O
of O
misery O
and O
remorse O
  O
perhaps O
she O
had O
been O
more O
quiet O
, O
more O
resolutely O
|
      | O
calm O
, O
and O
if O
it O
had O
not O
been O
for O
the O
strong O
appearances O
against O
her O
, O
he O
surely O
must O
have O
seen O
|
      | O
it O
was O
the O
strength O
and O
quiet O
of O
despair O
, O
not O
the O
defiance O
he O
believed O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
This O
rebellious O
spirit O
must O
be O
conquered O
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
on O
rejoining O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
who O
, O
with O
|
      | O
her O
children O
and O
Miss O
Harcourt B-PERSON
, O
had O
most O
anxiously O
and O
yet O
hopefully O
awaited O
the O
result O
of O
his O
|
      | O
interference O
. O
" O
We O
should O
actually O
be O
sharing O
her O
sin O
, O
if O
we O
permit O
her O
to O
conquer O
us O
by O

      | O
obduracy O
and O
self O

will O

Solitary O
confinement O
and O
complete O
idleness O
may O
bring O
her O
to O
a O
better O
|
      | O
temper O
, O
and O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
should O
be O
persisted O
in O
, O
till O
a O
full O
confession O
be O
made O
. O
If O

my O

      | O
dear O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
your O
niece O
should O
be O
banished O
from O
Oakwood B-ORG
. O
She O
must O
not O
remain O
here O
, O
a O
|
      | O
continual O
source O
of O
anxiety O
and O
misery O
to O
you O
, O
and O
of O
successful O
hardihood O
to O
herself O
  O
but O
of O
|
      | O
that O
there O
will O
be O
time O
enough O
to O
think O
when O
you O
have O
an O
answer O
from O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
  O
his O
|
      | O
judgment O
from O
a O
distance O
may O
be O
wiser O
than O
ours O
on O
the O
spot O
, O
and O
irritated O

by O
such O

      | O
unaccountable O
obstinacy O

thought O
almost O
too O

" O

And O
it O
was O
this O
incomprehensible O
change O
of O
character O
, O
in O
seeming O
, O
that O
still O
more O
perplexed O

      | O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON

and O
so O
made O
her O

worse O
fault O

the O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
that O
it O
was O
scarcely O
possible O
to O

      | O
disbelieve O
her O
  O
but O
what O
was O
this O
fearful O
difficulty O
, O
this O
pressing O
demand O
by O
one O
so O
young O
for O
|
      | O
so O
much O
money O
? O
Why O
, O
if O
it O
were O
comparatively O
innocent O
, O
would O
she O
not O
speak O
? O
" O
The O
more O
she O
|
      | O
thought O
, O
the O
more O
perplexed O
and O
anxious O
she O
seemed O
to O
become O

The O
act O
itself O
of O
endeavoring O
to O

      | O
dispose O
of O
the O
trinkets O
, O
especially O
those O
that O
had O
been O
given O
and O
received O
, O
as O
doubly O
valuable O
|
      | O
because O
they O
had O
been O
worn O
by O
her O
mother O
, O
would O
have O
been O
sufficiently O
faulty O
to O
have O

      | O
occasioned O
natural O
displeasure O
, O
but O
compared O
with O
other O
known O
and O
unknown O
faults O
, O
it O
sunk O
into O

      | O
almost O
nothing O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
collected O
them O
all O
together O
, O
those O
Mrs. O
Langford B-PERSON
had O
returned O
, O

      | O
and O
the O
few O
remaining O
in O
her O
niece O
's O
drawer O
, O
and O
carefully O
put O
them O
away O
, O
till O
circumstances O
|
      | O
might O
authorize O
her O
returning O
them O
to O
Ellen B-PERSON

and O
determined O
on O
saying O
nothing O
more O
on O
the O

      | O
subject O
either O
to O
Ellen B-PERSON
or O
her O
own O

  | O
One B-CARDINAL
thing O
Ellis B-GPE
reported O
to O
her O
regarding O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
which O
certainly O
seemed O
like O
a O
consciousness O
|
      | O
of O
the O
wrong O
she O
had O
done O
Robert B-PERSON
, O
and O
a O
wish O
to O
atone O
for O
it O
. O
She O
begged O
Ellis B-PERSON
so O
earnestly O
|
      | O
that O
she O
might O
see O
him O
, O
if O
it O
were O
only O
for O
five B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
, O
that O
she O
could O
not O
resist O
her O
  O
and O
|
      | O
when O
he O
came O
, O
she O
implored O
him O
so O
touchingly O
, O
so O
pleadingly O
to O
forgive O
her O
long O
silence O
|
      | O
himself O
, O
and O
entreat O
his O
mother O
to O
do O
so O
too O
  O
assuring O
him O
, O
that O
it O
was O
the O
hope O
of O
being O
able O
|
      | O
to O
restore O
the O
notes O
to O
him O
, O
without O
revealing O
her O
identity O
, O
which O
had O
caused O
the O
silence O
, O
|
      | O
that O
it O
was O
scarcely O
possible O
to O
listen O
to O
her O
unmoved O
. O
It O
was O
no O
false O
humility O
, O
but O
the O
|
      | O
deepest O
, O
most O
unfeigned O
contrition O
for O
having O
been O
the O
cause O
of O
injury O
. O

  | O
Ten B-DATE
days I-DATE
after O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
imprisonment O
, O
the O
letter O
arrived O
from O
Sir O
Edward B-PERSON
Manly I-PERSON
, O
which O
Mrs. O
|
      | O
Hamilton B-PERSON
had O
alluded O
to O
as O
necessary O
to O
be O
received O
, O
before O
she O
could O
write O
to O
her O
nephew O
, O
and O
|
      | O
the O
news O
it O
brought O
, O
though O
somewhat O
alloyed O
, O
would O
at O
another O
time O
have O
been O
received O
with O
|
      | O
the O
greatest O
delight O
. O
Edward B-PERSON
was O
returning O
. O
In O
three B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
, O
or O
a B-DATE
month I-DATE
at O
the O
utmost O
, O
after O
|
      | O
the O
receipt O
of O
his O
commander O
's O
letter O
, O
he O
might O
be O
with O
them O
all O
  O
invalided O
home O
for O
a O
three B-CARDINAL

      | O
or O
four B-DATE
months I-DATE

There O
had O
been O
another O
, O
and O
rather O
severe O
engagement O
, O
in O
which O
young O
|
      | O
Fortescue B-ORG
had O
still O
more O
distinguished O
himself O
  O
but O
from O
his O
headlong O
courage O
had O
been O
|
      | O
severely O
, O
but O
not O
at O
all O
seriously O
, O
hurt O
. O
Sir O
Edward B-PERSON
intended O
sending O
the O
pirate O
frigate O
which O
|
      | O
they O
had O
taken O
to O
England B-GPE
, O
as O
she O
was O
a O
tight O
- O
built O
, O
well O
looking O
craft O
enough O
, O
he O
wrote O
, O
if O
|
      | O
manned O
with O
honorable O
men O
instead O
of O
desperate O
villians O
  O
and O
had O
nominated O
Harding B-PERSON
and O
|
      | O
Fortescue B-ORG
to O
accompany O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
lieutenant O
, O
as O
her O
officers O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
name O
of O
Harding B-PERSON
produced O
no O
disagreeable O
reminiscences O
in O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
's O
mind O
. O
It O
had O
|
      | O
been O
so O
very O
long O
since O
Edward B-PERSON
had O
even O
mentioned O
him O
, O
that O
she O
had O
almost O
forgotten O
his O
early O
|
      | O
fancy O
for O
him O
. O
Her O
only O
thought O
now O
was O
thankfulness O
that O
her O
gallant O
nephew O
had O
been O
|
      | O
preserved O
, O
and O
that O
he O
was O
coming O
home O
. O
It O
could O
scarcely O
be O
pleasure O
she O
felt O
, O
though O
all O
the O
|
      | O
young O
party O
did O
, O
for O
there O
was O
such O
an O
excitement O
in O
Edward B-PERSON
's O
courage O
, O
and O
in O
his O
having O
been O
|
      | O
in O
two B-CARDINAL
desperate O
engagements O
, O
and O
seen O
so O
much O
, O
that O
, O
with O
the O
buoyancy O
happily O
natural O
to O
|
      | O
well O
- O
disposed O
youth O
, O
they O
could O
only O
think O
and O
talk O
of O
his O
return O
, O
forgetting O
the O
alloy O
that O
|
      | O
must O
cloud O
it O
. O
Percy B-PERSON
and O
Herbert B-PERSON
hoped O
he O
would O
arrive O
within O
the B-DATE
three I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
, O
as O
then O
they O
|
      | O
should O
be O
with O
him O
at B-DATE
least I-DATE
a I-DATE
week I-DATE
or O
ten B-DATE
days I-DATE
. O
If O
delayed O
, O
he O
would O
very O
provokingly O
just O
|
      | O
arrive O
as O
they O
would O
be O
returning O
to O
college O
. O
| 
  | O
After O
much O
painful O
deliberation O
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
determined O
on O
making O
Herbert B-PERSON
her O
messenger O
|
      | O
with O
these O
unexpected O
tidings O
to O
Ellen B-PERSON
  O
hoping O
more O
than O
she O
expressed O
that O
his O
gentle O
|
      | O
eloquence O
in O
bringing O
before O
her O
the O
misery O
to O
which O
she O
must O
condemn O
her O
brother O
if O
she O
would O
|
      | O
persist O
in O
this O
silence O
, O
and O
so O
compel O
an O
appeal O
to O
him O
, O
would O
have O
some O
effect O
  O
especially O
as O
|
      | O
she O
charged O
him O
to O
impress O
upon O
her O
that O
even O
now O
confession O
should O
bring O
pardon O
, O
and O
|
      | O
concealment O
of O
all O
from O
Edward B-PERSON
. O
Herbert B-PERSON
gladly O
undertook O
the O
mission O
, O
and O
so O
feelingly O
, O
so O
|
      | O
earnestly O
discharged O
it O
, O
that O
poor O
Ellen B-PERSON
felt O
more O
heart O
- O
broken O
than O
she O
had O
done O
yet O
, O
and O
|
      | O
almost O
incapable O
of O
retaining O
her O
firmness O
. O
But O
she O
did O
  O
for O
danger O
to O
Edward B-PERSON
seemed O
more O
|
      | O
imminent O
now O
that O
he O
was O
coming O
home O
, O
to O
the O
very O
vicinity O
of O
his O
dreaded O
uncle O
, O
than O
when O
he O
|
      | O
was O
at O
a O
distance O
. O
She O
could O
only O
feel O
thankful O
— O
if O
concealment O
were O
indeed O
so O
absolutely O
|
      | O
necessary O
as O
he O
had O
declared O
it O
to O
be O
— O
that O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
was O
still O
from O
home O
, O
and O
might O
|
      | O
continue O
to O
be O
so O
during O
Edward B-PERSON
's O
visit O
. O
It O
was O
difficult O
to O
repress O
the O
sickening O
shudder O
, O
|
      | O
when O
Herbert B-PERSON
chanced O
to O
mention O
that O
Harding B-PERSON
was O
her O
brother O
's O
companion O
in O
his O
voyage O
home O
, O
|
      | O
and O
difficult O
, O
not O
to O
express O
more O
disappointment O
than O
the O
occasion O
warranted O
, O
that O
Edward B-PERSON
had O
|
      | O
not O
answered O
her O
last O
letter O
. O
He O
must O
have O
received O
it O
, O
Herbert B-PERSON
said O
, O
for O
Sir O
Edward B-PERSON
|
      | O
acknowledged O
his O
father O
's O
in O
which O
hers O
to O
Edward B-PERSON
had O
been O
inclosed O
. O
He O
left O
her O
after O
a O
very O
|
      | O
long O
interview O
, O
deeply O
grieved O
at O
the O
failure O
of O
all O
his O
persuasions O
, O
all O
his O
remonstrances O
, O
|
      | O
but O
compelled O
, O
he O
could O
not O
satisfactorily O
explain O
why O
, O
either O
to O
himself O
or O
to O
his O
family O
, O
to O
|
      | O
pity O
far O
more O
than O
to O
blame O
. O
Percy B-PERSON
declared O
, O
as O
did O
Caroline B-PERSON
and O
Miss O
Harcourt B-PERSON
, O
that O
it O
must O
|
      | O
be O
only O
his O
own O
too O
kind O
and O
gentle O
disposition O
, O
which O
never O
could O
blame O
anybody O
or O
any O
thing O
. O
|
      | O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
was O
bitterly O
disappointed O
  O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
insisted O
that O
such O
obduracy O
demanded O
|
      | O
nothing O
but O
the O
sternest O
treatment O
, O
and O
he O
only O
wished O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
's O
letter O
could O
arrive O
at O
|
      | O
once O
. O
He O
saw O
Ellen B-PERSON
again O
himself O
twice O
in O
the B-DATE
five I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
, O
which O
elapsed O
between O
the O
discovery O
|
      | O
of O
her O
sin O
and O
the O
arrival O
of O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
's O
answer O
  O
but O
if O
kindness O
had O
so O
failed O
, O
it O
was O
|
      | O
comparatively O
easy O
to O
resist O
his O
well O
- O
intentioned O
, O
but O
in O
this O
case O
utterly O
mistaken O
|
      | O
sternness O
. O
He O
was O
in O
general O
so O
kind O
even O
in O
his O
judgments O
, O
that O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
thought O
he O
must O
|
      | O
have O
some O
reason O
to O
believe O
Ellen B-PERSON
so O
thoroughly O
hardened O
, O
and O
from O
his O
report O
of O
her O
was O
|
      | O
enabled O
to O
impart O
her O
husband O
's O
sentence O
with O
more O
firmness O
, O
than O
had O
she O
listened O
to O
her O
own O
|
      | O
kind O
, O
still O
loving O
heart O
. O
| 
  | O
It O
was O
as O
she O
and O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
had O
both O
expected O
. O
Ellen B-PERSON
was O
no O
longer O
to O
remain O
at O
Oakwood B-ORG
, O
|
      | O
but O
to O
be O
placed O
under O
the O
care O
of O
a O
maiden O
lady O
, O
living O
in O
Yorkshire B-GPE
, O
a O
relation O
of O
Mr. O
|
      | O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
and O
one O
who O
had O
occasionally O
visited O
Oakwood B-ORG
, O
and O
was O
, O
therefore O
, O
well O
known O
to O
Mrs. O
|
      | O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
and O
to O
Ellis B-PERSON
too O
, O
and O
regarded O
with O
such O
dislike O
by O
the O
latter O
, O
as O
to O
make O
her O
|
      | O
actually O
venture O
to O
entreat O
her O
mistress O
not O
to O
send O
Miss O
Ellen B-PERSON
to O
her O
  O
she O
was O
sure O
it O
would O
|
      | O
break O
her O
heart O
. O
Now O
Miss O
Seldon B-PERSON
was O
one O
of O
the O
worthiest O
women O
that O
ever O
breathed O
— O
honest O
, O
|
      | O
straightforward O
, O
truth O
- O
speaking O
literally O
to O
a O
fault O
, O
but O
as O
hard O
as O
she O
was O
true O
. O
Whether O
she O
|
      | O
ever O
had O
any O
feelings O
or O
not O
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
with O
all O
her O
penetration O
, O
never O
could O
discover O
  O
|
      | O
but O
the O
good O
she O
did O
was O
immense O
in O
practical O
benevolence O
, O
though O
the O
quick O
sympathy O
, O
the O
|
      | O
kindly O
word O
, O
the O
indulgent O
thought O
, O
seemed O
utterly O
unknown O
. O
She O
had O
no O
pity O
for O
faults O
or O
|
      | O
failings O
, O
always O
declaring O
forbearance O
and O

      | O
had O
so O
contradicted O

Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
's O
letter O
read O
harshly O

confessed O

her O
confession O

Miss O

remembered O

the O
young O
Hamiltons B-PERSON

      | O
( O
though O
, O
it O
was O

them O
all O
— O
even O
Percy B-PERSON
and O
|
      | O
Caroline B-GPE
, O
the O
most O
indignant O
against O
Ellen B-PERSON
— O
to O
think O
of O
their O
father O
's O
sentence O
with O
the O
|
      | O
deepest O
regret O
, O
and O
with O
almost O
dread O
for O
its O
effect O
on O
Ellen B-PERSON

" O
If O

Emmeline B-PERSON

exclamation O

the O
only O

ever O

no O

" O

" O
Poor O

  | O
Mrs. O

might O

did O
think O
with O
them O
all O

but O
she O
could O
not O
swerve O
from O
her O
duty O
. O
She O
|
      | O
wrote O
at O
once O
to O
Miss O
Seldon B-PERSON
, O
not O
entering O
into O
particulars O
, O
but O
merely O
asking O
if O
she O
would O
|
      | O
consent O
to O
take O
charge O
of O
a O
relative O
, O
whose O
conduct O
demanded O
more O
rigid O
watchfulness O

care O
, O

      | O
and O
an O
entire O
cessation O
of O

, O
than O
could O
be O
the O
case O
in O
the O
family O
circle O
at O
Oakwood B-ORG
. O
|
      | O
She O
and O
her O
husband O
had O
such O
perfect O
confidence O
in O
her O
, O
she O
said O
, O
that O
if O
she O
could O
oblige O

      | O
them O
by O
undertaking O
the O
duty O

they O
knew O

without O
any O
assurance O
on O
her O
part O

that O
she O
would O

      | O
discharge O
it O
faithfully O
. O
The O
yearly B-DATE
sum O
they O
offered O
was O
large O
, O
because O
they O
wished O
their O

      | O
young O
relative O
to O
have O
all O
the O
comforts O

the O
best O
education O

the O
city O
near O

could O
afford O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
had O
no O

      | O
doubt O
of O
the O
affirmative O
nature O
of O
the O
reply O
, O
for O
Miss O
Seldon B-PERSON
owed O
the O
recovery O
of O
her O
fortune O

      | O
and O
position O
entirely O
to O
the O
exertions O
of O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
  O
and O
she O
had O
told O
him O
, O
once O
for O
all O
, O

      | O
that O
if O
she O

oblige O
him O
in O
any O
way O
, O
great O

small O
, O
it O
would O
make O
her O
far O

      | O
happier O
than O
she O
had O
ever O
been O
, O

was O
likely O
to O

in O
her O
solitary O

The O
letter O
written O

      | O
and O
dispatched O
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
summoned O
Ellen B-PERSON
once O
more O
to O
her O
presence O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
scene O
was O
again O
the O
library O
, O
where O
she O
had O
been O
writing O
, O
and O
the O
time O
nearing O
the O
short O
|
      | O
twilight O
of O
October B-DATE
. O
It O
was O
three B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
, O
rather O
more O
, O
since O
Sir O
Edward B-PERSON
Manly I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
letter O
had O
been O
|
      | O
received O
, O
and O
Edward B-PERSON
was O
, O
therefore O
, O
almost B-DATE
daily I-DATE
expected O
. O
The O
feelings O
with O
which O
his O
|
      | O
unhappy O
sister O
looked O
to O
his O
return O
it O
would O
be O
a O
vain O
attempt O
to O
define O
. O
At O
times O
the O
intense O
|
      | O
longing O
to O
see O
him O
again O
, O
caused O
a O
wild O
, O
almost O
sick O
feeling O
of O
pleasure O
, O
that O
she O
might O
, O
|
      | O
perhaps O
, O
so O
soon O
do O
so O
  O
then O
came O
all O
that O
had O
passed O
, O
and O
she O
pictured O
his O
anger O
, O
his O
|
      | O
loathing O
— O
true O
it O
had O
been O
for O
him O
, O
but O
he O
had O
not O
thought O
of O
such O
a O
deed O
. O
He O
would O
, O
he O
must O
|
      | O
hate O
and O
spurn O
her O
, O
too O
  O
and O
the O
idea O
of O
meeting O
him O
became O
absolute O
agony O
. O
Then O
— O
and O
she O
|
      | O
shuddered O
in O
dread O
— O
would O
he O
think O
that O
he O
must O
acknowledge O
it O
was O
for O
him O
she O
had O
thus O
acted O
? O
|
      | O
and O
, O
if O
so O
, O
had O
she O
not O
betrayed O
instead O
of O
saving O
him O
? O
Incident O
after O
incident O
in O
their O
|
      | O
childhood O
rose O
before O
her O
, O
to O
give O
her O
hope O
that O
he O
would O
be O
silent O
now O
as O
then O
, O
and O
not O
|
      | O
betray O
himself O
  O
but O
these O
contending O
terrors O
, O
united O
with O
the O
constant O
though O
silent O
suffering O
|
      | O
of O
her O
banishment O
from O
all O
she O
loved O
, O
the O
utter O
hopelessness O
as O
to O
the O
end O
of O
this O
trial O
, O
had O

      | O
not O
been O
without O
their O
effect O
on O
the O
outward O
frame O

Ellis B-PERSON
did O
not O
see O
it O
, O
from O
so O
constantly O

      | O
watching O
her O

from O
Ellen B-PERSON
never O

take O
the O
exercise O

her O

not O

      | O
making O
a O
single O
complaint O

the O
pain O
it O
was O
sometimes O
to O
walk O

always O
to O
swallow O
her O

the O
full O
light O
of O
the O
oriel O
window O
— O
her O

      | O
approach O

been O
so O
noiseless O
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
bending O
over O
some O
papers O

did O
not O
see O

      | O
her O
till O
she O
chanced O
to O
look O
up O
— O
the O
attenuation O
of O
form O
and O
feature O
was O
so O
very O
visible O
, O
that O
|
      | O
her O
aunt O
could O
not O
prevent O
herself O
from O
starting O
painfully O
, O
and O
the O
words O
with O
which O
she O
had O

      | O
intended O
to O
address O
her O
froze O
on O
her O
lips O
. O
It O
was O
with O
the O
utmost O
difficulty O
she O
refrained O

      | O
from O
folding O
her O
to O
her O
heart O
, O
and O
trying O
, O
by O
every O
means O
affection O

devise O

to O
soothe O

remove O
that O
anguish O

whatever O
its O
nature O
, O
far O
too O
deep O
and O
constant O
for O
one O
so O
very O
young O
  O

      | O
how O
dared O
she O
do O
this O

when O
, O
by O
this O
determined O
silence O

Ellen B-PERSON
so O
defied O
her O
authority O

and O

      | O
seemed O
so O
resolved O
that O
neither O
severity O

kindness O

nor O
her O
own O
sufferings O
should O
humble O

Conquering O
with O
a O
powerful O
effort O
the O
pleadings O
of O
affection O

Mrs. O

calmly O
entered O

on O
the O
subject O
for O

summoned O
her O

her O
a O
greater O
part O
of O
her O
uncle O

hoping O
that O
its O
severity O
would O
spare O
her O
the O
pain O
of O
any O
additional O
remarks O

the O

not O

cheek O

paler O

that O
her O
white O
lips O
quivered O
repeatedly O

as O

several O
times O

could O

a O
silence O
of O
some B-TIME

she O

turned O

still O
in O
that O
unbroken O
silence O

reached O
the O

the O
upper O

the O

reeled O

trembled O
herself O

      | O
at O
finding O
Ellen B-PERSON
quite O
insensible O

unusually O
difficult O

the O
work O

it O
was O
many O
minutes O
before O
their O
united O

      | O
efforts O
could O
bring O
back O
consciousness O

Ellis B-PERSON

exclamation O
, O
in O
a O
tone O
of O
most O

      | O
unusual O
excitement O

asked O
her O
mistress O

as O
, O
unable O
to O
resist O
the O

      | O
impulse O

she O
bent O
down O

repeatedly O
kissed O
the O
cold O
brow O

cheek O

to O

she O
was O
so O

      | O
earnestly O

repeated O
Mrs. O

so O
bewildered O

as O
to O
stop O
for O
the O
moment O

cold O
hand O

Master O
Edward B-PERSON

always O
so O
terrified O
at O
the O
mere O
thought O
of O

knowing O
any O
of O

faults O

must O
not O

suspect O
any O
thing O

poor O
lamb O
  O

      | O
it O
will O
make O

still O
more O
miserable O

better O
now O

dear O
Miss B-PERSON

you O
not O

" O
she O

      | O
added O
, O
soothingly O
, O
as O
Ellen B-PERSON
feebly O
raised O
her O
hand O
to O
her O
forehead O
, O
and O
then O
slowly O
unclosed O

      | O
her O
eyes O
, O
and O
beheld O
her O
aunt O
leaning O
over O
her O
, O
with O
that O
same O
expression O
of O
anxious O
|
      | O
affection O
, O
which O
her O
illness O
had O
so O
often O
caused O
in O
her O
childhood O
. O
Sense O
, O
or O
rather O
memory O
, O

      | O
had O
not O
quite O
returned O
, O
and O
her O
first B-ORDINAL
words O
were O
, O
with O
a O
faint O
but O
happy O
smile O
— O

" O
I O
am O
better O

" O
But O
it O
was O
only O
a O

      | O
momentary O
forgetfulness O
  O
swift O
as O
thought O
came O
the O
whole O
of O
what O
had O
so O
lately O
passed O
— O
her O

      | O
uncle O

letter O

her O
aunt O

words O

murmuring O

in O
a O
tone O
how O
painfully O
changed O
! O
" O

      | O
forgot O

buried O
her O
face O

the O
pillow O

a O

      | O
few O
words O

make O

happier O

exclaimed O
Mrs. O

almost O
imploringly O
, O

over O

answered O
Ellis B-PERSON
, O
very O
respectfully O
, O
though O
|
      | O
meaningly O
, O
as O
her O
look O
drew O
her O
mistress O
's O
attention O
to O
the O
shudder O
which O
convulsed O
Ellen B-PERSON

      | O
slight O
frame O
, O
at O
the O
mention O
of O
her O
brother O

  | O
Pained O
and O
bewildered O
more O
than O
ever O
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
after O
waiting O
till O
the O
faintness O
seemed O
|
      | O
quite O
gone O
, O
and O
thinking O
that O
if O
the O
restraint O
of O
her O
presence O
were O
removed O
, O
Ellen B-PERSON
might O
be O

      | O
relieved O
by O
tears O
, O
left O
her O
, O
desiring O
Ellis B-PERSON
to O
let O
her O
know O
in O
a O
short O
time O
how O
she O
was O
. O
The O
|
      | O
moment O
the O
door O
closed O
, O
Ellen B-PERSON
threw O
her O
arms O
round O
Ellis B-PERSON

neck O
, O
exclaiming O
passionately O
— O

too O
glad O

not O
punishment O

almost O
for O
the O

So O
intense O

the O

relief O

Even O
the O
supposition O
made O

      | O
her O
heart O
yearn O
toward O
her O
with O
such O
a O
feeling O
of O

resolutely O
checked O

its O
ascendency O

her O

Overcome O

the O
harshness O
of O
the O

hearted O
Percy B-PERSON

whom O
she O
so O
dearly O

      | O
loved O
, O
as O
by O
the O
gentle O
kindness O
of O
Herbert B-PERSON
, O
Ellen B-PERSON
remained O
for O
several B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
with O
her O
arms O

      | O
on O
the O
table O
, O
her O
face O
hid O
upon O
them O
. O
She O
thought O
she O
was O
quite O
alone O
, O
for O
Ellis B-ORG
had O
gone O
|
      | O
about O
some O
of O
her O
business O
, O
when O
she O
was O
startled O
by O
Percy B-PERSON
's O
voice O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
am O
a O
brute O
, O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
nothing O
less O
  O
forgive O
me O
, O
and O
say O
good O
- O
by O
. O
I O
ca O
n't O
understand O
it O
at O
|
      | O
all O
, O
but O
angry O
as O
I O
am O
with O
you O
, O
your O
pale O
face O
haunts O
me O
like O
a O
specter O
, O
so O
we O
must O
part O
|
      | O
friends O
  O
" O
and O
as O
she O
looked O
hastily O
up O
, O
he O
kissed O
her O
warmly O
twice O
, O
and O
ran O
away O
without O
|
      | O
another O
word O
. O
| 
  | O
Days O
passed O
heavily O
, O
the O
gales O
seeming O
to O
increase O
in O
violence O
, O
and O
causing O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
|
      | O
more O
terrible O
anxiety O
and O
vague O
dread O
than O
she O
allowed O
to O
be O
visible O
. O
The O
damage O
among O
the O
|
      | O
shipping O
was O
fearful O
, O
and O
the O
very O
supposed O
vicinity O
of O
the O
frigate O
to O
the O
Channel B-ORG
increased O
|
      | O
the O
danger O
. O
The O
papers O
every B-TIME
morning I-TIME
presented O
long O
lists O
of O
ships O
wrecked O
, O
or O
fatally O
|
      | O
dismantled O
, O
loss O
of O
crews O
or O
part O
of O
them O
, O
mails O
and O
cargoes O
due O
but O
missing O
: O
and O
the O
vivid O
|
      | O
recollection O
of O
the O
supposed O
fate O
of O
her O
own O
brother O
, O
the O
wretchedness O
of O
the O
suspense O
before O
|
      | O
the O
fate O
of O
his O
vessel O
was O
ascertained O
, O
returned O
to O
heighten O
the O
fears O
that O
would O
gain O
|
      | O
ascendency O
for O
her O
nephew O
, O
and O
for O
the O
effect O
of O
this O
terrible O
suspense O
on O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
more O
|
      | O
especially O
— O
if O
indeed O
she O
had O
endured O
all O
these B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
, O
nay O
, O
months B-DATE
, O
of O
misery O
for O
him O
. O
| 
  | O
At O
first O
Ellen O
seemed O
unconscious O
that O
there O
was O
any O
thing O
remarkable O
in O
the O
delay O
, O
the O
|
      | O
thought O
of O
her O
own O
departure O
being O
uppermost O
  O
but O
when O
the O
thought O
did O
press O
upon O
her O
, O
how O
it O
|
      | O
came O
she O
knew O
not O
— O
that O
of O
the B-DATE
given I-DATE
month I-DATE
the O
weeks O
were O
passing O
, O
and O
Edward B-PERSON
had O
not O
arrived O
, O
|
      | O
and O
that O
there O
must O
be O
some O
reason O
for O
the O
long O
delay O
— O
storm O
, O
shipwreck O
, O
death O
, O
all O
flashed O
|
      | O
upon O
her O
at O
once O
, O
and O
almost O
maddened O
her O
. O
The O
quiet O
calm O
of O
endurance O
gave O
way O
. O
She O
could O
not O
|
      | O
sleep O
at O
night B-TIME
from O
the O
tremendous O
winds O
  O
not O
even O
when O
Ellis B-ORG
had O
a O
bed O
put O
up O
in O
her O
room O
, O
|
      | O
and O
remained O
with O
her O
all B-TIME
night I-TIME
herself O
  O
she O
never O
complained O
indeed O
, O
but O
hour B-TIME
after I-TIME
hour I-TIME
she O
|
      | O
would O
pace O
her O
room O
and O
the O
passage O
leading O
to O
Ellis B-PERSON
's O
, O
till O
compelled O
to O
cease O
from O
|
      | O
exhaustion O
  O
she O
would O
try O
steadily O
to O
employ O
herself O
with O
some O
difficult O
study O
, O
and O
succeed O
, O
|
      | O
perhaps O
, O
for O
half B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour I-TIME
, O
but O
then O
remain O
powerless O
, O
or O
recommence O
her O
restless O
walk O
. O
Mrs. O
|
      | O
Hamilton B-PERSON
made O
several O
attempts O
without O
any O
apparent O
interference O
on O
her O
part O
, O
to O
get O
her O
to O
|
      | O
sit O
occasionally O
with O
her O
and O
Miss O
Harcourt B-PERSON
, O
and O
her O
cousins O
, O
but O
she O
seemed O
to O
shrink O
from O
|
      | O
them O
all O
. O
Emmeline O
, O
indeed O
, O
when O
once O
aware O
of O
the O
terrible O
trial O
she O
was O
enduring O
, O
would O
sit O
|
      | O
with O
her O
, O
drawing O
or O
working O
as O
if O
nothing O
had O
occurred O
to O
estrange O
them O
, O
and O
try O
to O
cheer O
her O
|
      | O
by O
talking O
on O
many O
topics O
of O
interest O
. O
Caroline B-PERSON
would O
speak O
to O
her O
kindly O
whenever O
she O
saw O
|
      | O
her O
. O
Miss O
Harcourt B-GPE
alone O
retained O
her O
indignation O
, O
for O
no O
suspicion O
of O
the O
real O
cause O
of O
her O
|
      | O
silence O
ever O
entered O
her O
mind O
. O
| 
  | O
Poor O
Ellen O
felt O
that O
she O
dared O
not O
indulge O
in O
the O
comfort O
this O
change O
in O
her O
aunt O
's O
and O
|
      | O
cousins O
' O
manner O
produced O
. O
She O
wanted O
to O
wean B-NORP
herself O
quite O
from O
them O
, O
that O
the O
pang O
of O
|
      | O
separation O
might O
be O
less O
severe O
, O
but O
she O
only O
seemed O
to O
succeed O
in O
loving O
them O
more O
. O
One B-CARDINAL
|
      | O
thought O
, O
indeed O
, O
at O
length O
took O
such O
entire O
possession O
of O
her O
mind O
, O
as O
to O
deaden O
every O
|
      | O
other:—it B-PRODUCT
was O
the O
horrible O
idea O
that O
as O
she O
had O
sinned O
to O
save O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
perhaps O
, O
from O
merited O
|
      | O
disgrace O
, O
he O
would O
be O
taken O
from O
her O
  O
she O
never O
breathed O
it O
, O
but O
it O
haunted O
her O
night O
and O
day O
. O
|
      | O
Mr. O
Maitland B-PERSON
saw O
her O
continually O
, O
but O
he O
plainly O
told O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
while O
the O
cause O
of O
|
      | O
anxiety O
and O
mental O
suffering O
lasted O
he O
could O
do O
her O
no O
good O
. O
It O
was O
a O
constant O
alternation O
of O
|
      | O
fearful O
excitement O
and O
complete O
depression O
, O
exhausting O
the O
whole O
system O
. O
Repose O
and O
|
      | O
kindness O
— O
alas O
! O
the O
latter O
might O
be O
given O
, O
but O
the O
former O
, O
in O
the O
present O
position O
of O
affairs O
, O
|
      | O
how O
could O
it O
be O
insured O
? O
| 
  | O
The B-DATE
month I-DATE
of O
grace O
was O
waning O
  O
only B-DATE
two I-DATE
days I-DATE
remained O
, O
and O
Edward B-PERSON
had O
not O
arrived O
, O
and O
how O
|
      | O
could O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
obey O
her O
husband O
— O
whose O
every O
letter O
reiterated O
his O
hope O
that O
she O
had O
not O
|
      | O
been O
prevailed O
on O
to O
alter O
his O
sentence O
, O
if O
Ellen B-PERSON
still O
remained O
silent O
— O
and O
send O
her O
niece O
|
      | O
from O
her O
? O
She O
came O
at O
length O
to O
the O
determination O
, O
that O
if O
another B-DATE
week I-DATE
passed O
and O
still O
there O
|
      | O
were O
no O
tidings O
, O
not O
to O
let O
this O
fearful O
self O
- O
sacrifice O
, O
if O
it O
really O
were O
such O
, O
last O
any O
|
      | O
longer O
, O
but O
gently O
, O
cautiously O
, O
tenderly O
as O
she O
could O
, O
prevail O
on O
Ellen B-PERSON
to O
confide O
all O
to O
her O
, O
|
      | O
and O
promise O
, O
if O
Edward B-PERSON
really O
had O
been O
erring O
and O
in O
difficulties O
, O
all O
should O
be O
forgiven O
for O
|
      | O
her O
sake O
, O
and O
even O
his O
uncle O
's O
anger O
averted O
. O
Once O
her O
determination O
taken O
, O
she O
felt O
better O
|
      | O
enabled O
to O
endure O
an O
anxiety O
which O
was O
injuring O
her O
almost O
as O
much O
as O
Ellen B-PERSON
  O
and O
she O
turned O
to O
|
      | O
Ellis B-GPE
's O
room O
, O
which O
she O
had O
lately O
very O
often O
frequented O
, O
for O
she O
scarcely O
felt O
comfortable O
|
      | O
when O
Ellen B-PERSON
was O
out O
of O
her O
sight O
, O
though O
she O
had O
full O
confidence O
in O
Ellis B-GPE
's O
care O
. O
| 
  | O
Ellen B-PERSON
was O
asleep O
on O
a O
sofa O
, O
looking O
so O
wan O
, O
so O
haggard O
— O
so O
altered O
from O
the O
Ellen O
of O
five B-CARDINAL
|
      | O
short O
months O
back O
, O
that O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
sat O
down O
by O
her O
side O
, O
pondering O
whether O
she O
was O
doing O
|
      | O
right O
to O
wait O
even O
another B-DATE
week I-DATE
, O
before O
she O
should O
try O
to O
bring O
relief O
by O
avowing O
her O
|
      | O
suspicions O
— O
but O
would O
it O
bring O
relief O
? O
and O
, O
after O
all O
, O
was O
it O
for O
Edward B-PERSON
? O
or O
, O
had O
she O
been O
|
      | O
allowing O
affection O
and O
imagination O
to O
mislead O
and O
soften O
, O
when O
sternness O
might O
still O
be O

      | O
needed O
? O
| 
  | O
Ellen B-PERSON
woke O
with O
a O
start O
as O
from O
some O
fearful O
dream O
, O
and O
gazed O
at O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
for O
a O
full O
|
      | O
minute O
, O
as O
if O
she O
did O
not O
know O
her O
. O

  | O
" O
My O
dear O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
what O
is O
it O
? O
You O

uncomfortably O

she O
put O

      | O
one O
hand O
to O
her O
forehead O
, O
and O
gazed O
hurriedly O

fearfully O
round O
her O
, O
while O
, O
with O
the O
other O
, O

      | O
she O
held O
tightly O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON

dress O

There O
was O
something O
alarming O
both O
in O
her O
look O

      | O
tone O

The O
soothing O
tone O

her O
brother O

to O
disperse O
the O
cloud O

Mr. O

There O
was O
but O
one B-CARDINAL
hope O
, O
one B-CARDINAL
ray O
of O
light O
— O
Edward B-PERSON
's O
own O
honor O
, O
if O
indeed O
he O

      | O
were O
permitted O

return O
  O
and O
even O
while O
driving O
and O
talking O
with O
Caroline B-PERSON
, O
her O
heart O
was O
one B-CARDINAL

      | O
fervent O
prayer O
that O
this O
might O
be O
, O
and O
the O
fearful O
struggle O
of O
her O
devoted O
Ellen B-PERSON
cease O
. O

  | O
Her O
aunt O

gentle O
and O
unexpected O
kindness O
had O
had O
such O
a O
beneficial O
effect O
on O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
that O
, O

      | O
after O
her O
early O
dinner O
, O
about B-TIME
three I-TIME
o'clock I-TIME
, O
she O
told O
Ellis B-PERSON
she O
would O
go O
in O
the O
school O

room O
, O
|
      | O
and O
try O
and O
read O
there O
for O
an B-TIME
hour I-TIME
  O
she O
knew O
all O
the O
family O
were O
out O
, O
and O
therefore O
would O
be O
|
      | O
quite O
undisturbed O
. O
Ellis B-PERSON
willingly O
acquiesced O
, O
rejoicing O
that O
she O
should O
seek O
any O
change O
|
      | O
herself O
, O
and O
advised O
her O
, O
as O
it O
was O
such O
a O
mild O
, O
soft O
afternoon B-TIME
, O
after O
the O
late O
storms O
, O
to O

      | O
take O
a O
turn O
on O
the O
terrace O

on O
which O
a O
glass O

from O

opened O
  O
it O
would O
do O
her O

      | O
good O

Ellen B-PERSON
meant O
to O
take O
her O
advice O

but O
as O
she O
looked O
out O
from O
a O
window O
over O
a O

      | O
well O

remembered O
landscape O
, O
so O
many O
painful O
thoughts O
and O
recollections O
crowded O
on O
her O
, O
that O
she O
|
      | O
lost O
all O
inclination O
to O
move O
. O
She O
had O
not O
stood O
there O
for O
many B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
, O
and O
it O
seemed O
to O
her O
|
      | O
that O
the O
view O
had O
never O
looked O
so O
very O
lovely O
. O
The O
trees O
all O
had O
the O
last O
glories O
of O

      | O
autumn O
— O
for O
it O
was O
early O
in O
November B-DATE
— O
the O
grass O
was O
of O
that O
beautiful O
humid O
emerald O
which O
always O

      | O
follows O
heavy O

the O

the O

of O
the O

lying O
beneath O
the O

presented O
many O
very O
beautiful O
still O

The O
end O
of O
the O

      | O
terrace O
, O
a O
flight O
of O
stone O
steps O
, O
overlooked O
the O
avenue O
, O
leading O
from O
the O
principal O
lodge O
to O

      | O
the O
main O
entrance O
, O
and O
where O
Ellen B-PERSON
stood O
, O
she O
could O
distinguish O
a B-QUANTITY
few I-QUANTITY
yards I-QUANTITY
of O
the O
path O
where O
|
      | O
it O
issued O
from O
some O
distant O
trees O
. O
She O
gazed O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
conscious O
only O
that O
she O
was O
banished O
|
      | O
from O
it O
all O
, O
and O
that O
, O
however O
long O
her O
departure O
might O
be O
deferred O
, O
she O
must O
go O
at O
last O
, O
for O
|
      | O
her O
uncle O
's O
mandate O
could O
not O
be O
disobeyed O
  O
but O
gradually O
her O
eye O
became O
fixed O
as O
in O
|
      | O
fascination O
. O
A O
single O
figure O
was O
emerging O
from O
the O
trees O
, O
and O
dressed O
in O
the O
uniform O
of O
a O
|
      | O
midshipman O
— O
she O
was O
sure O
it O
was O
! O
but O
it O
was O
a O
figure O
so O
tall O
, O
so O
slim O
, O
his O
step O
so O
lingering O
, O

      | O
it O
could O
not O
be O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
most O
likely O
some O
one O
of O
his O
messmates O
come O
to O
tell O
his O
fate O
. O
He O
was O
|
      | O
taller O
even O
than O
Percy B-PERSON
, O
but O
so O
much O
slighter O
, O
so O
different O
to O
the O
boy O
from O
whom O
she O
had O
|
      | O
parted O
, O
that O
, O
though O
her O
heart O
bounded O
and O
sunk O
till O
faintness O
seemed O
to O
overpower O
her O
, O
she O
|
      | O
could O
not O
convince O
herself O
it O
was O
he O
. O
With O
an O
almost O
unconscious O
effort O
she O
ran O
out O
, O
through O
|
      | O
the O
glass O
- O
door O
, O
to O
the O
steps O
of O
the O
terrace O
  O
she O
could O
now O
see O
him O
distinctly O
, O
but O
not O
his O
|
      | O
face O
, O
for O
his O
cap O
was O
low O
over O
his O
forehead O
  O
but O
as O
he O
approached O
, O
he O
paused O
, O
as O
if O
doubting O
|
      | O
whether O
to O
go O
up O
to O
the O
hall O
door O
, O
or O
the O
well O
- O
known O
terrace O
, O
by O
which O
he O
had O
always O
rushed O
|
      | O
into O
the O
school O
- O
room O
, O
on O
his O
daily B-DATE
return O
from O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
's O
  O
and O
as O
he O
looked O
hastily O
up O
, O
his O
|
      | O
cap O
fell O
back O
, O
and O
his O
eyes O
met O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
. O
A O
wild O
but O
checked O
scream O
broke O
from O
her O
lips O
, O
and O
|
      | O
all O
was O
an O
impenetrable O
mist O
till O
she O
found O
herself O
in O
her O
brother O
's O
arms O
, O
in O
the O
room O
she O
had O
|
      | O
quitted O
, O
his O
lips O
repeatedly O
pressing O
her O
cheek O
and O
forehead O
, O
and O
his O
voice O
, O
which O
sounded O
so O
|
      | O
strange O
— O
it O
did O
not O
seem O
like O
Edward B-PERSON
's O
, O
it O
was O
so O
much O
more O
deep O
and O
manly O
— O
entreating O
her O
to O
|
      | O
speak O
to O
him O
, O
and O
tell O
him O
why O
she O
looked O
so O
ill O
  O
but O
still O
her O
heart O
so O
throbbed O
she O
could O
|
      | O
not O
speak O
. O
She O
could O
only O
cling O
close O
to O
him O
and O
look O
intently O
in O
his O
face O
, O
which O
was O
so O
|
      | O
altered O
from O
the O
happy O
, O
laughing O
boy O
, O
that O
had O
he O
not O
been O
, O
from O
his O
extreme O
paleness O
and O
|
      | O
attenuation O
of O
feature O
, O
still O
more O
like O
their O
mother O
when O
she O
was O
ill O
, O
his O
sister O
would O
|
      | O
scarcely O
have O
known O
him O
. O

" O

things O

" O
answered O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
becoming O
so O
deadly O
pale O
, O
that O
Edward B-PERSON
forced O
himself O
to O

      | O
regain O
composure O
  O
the O
nature O
of O
his O
information O

such O
a O
revulsion O
of O
feeling O
in O
his O

      | O

A O

      | O
sudden O
squall O

upset O
the O

the O

so O
encumbered O
by O
a O
large O
great O

  | O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
had O
been O
told O
at O
the O
lodge O
of O
her O
nephew O
's O
arrival O
, O
and O
so O
powerful O
was O
her O
|
      | O
emotion O
, O
that O
she O
leaned O
back O
in O
the O
carriage O
, O
as O
it O
drove O
rapidly O
from O
the O
lodge O
to O
the O
Hall O
, O
|
      | O
without O
the O
power O
of O
uttering O
a O
word O
. O
Caroline B-PERSON
was O
surprised O
, O
for O
his O
return O
seemed O
to O
her O
|
      | O
only O
a O
cause O
of O
rejoicing O
  O
she O
had O
no O
idea O
of O
the O
mingled O
dread O
and O
joy O
, O
the O
trembling O
, O
lest O
|
      | O
Edward B-PERSON
had O
indeed O
deceived O
them O
all O
, O
and O
, O
if O
he O
had O
not O
, O
the O
redoubled O
mystery O
of O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
|
      | O
conduct O
. O
While O
he O
was O
absent O
she O
could O
think O
calmly O
on O
him O
as O
the O
cause O
of O
all O
, O
but O
now O
that O
|
      | O
he O
was O
returned O
, O
her O
heart O
seemed O
to O
turn O
sick O
with O
apprehension O
, O
and O
she O
had O
hardly O
strength O
|
      | O
to O
inquire O
where O
he O
was O
, O
and O
great O
was O
her O
surprise O
when O
she O
found O
his O
arrival O
was O
still O
|
      | O
unknown O
. O
Caroline B-PERSON
's O
joyful O
exclamation O
as O
she O
ran O
into O
the O
school O
- O
room O
to O
put O
away O
some O
of O
her O
|
      | O
purchases O
, O
drew O
her O
there O
at O
once O
  O
and O
for O
the B-TIME
first I-TIME
five I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
the O
intense O
thankfulness O
|
      | O
that O
he O
was O
indeed O
safe O
and O
comparatively O
well O
— O
that O
whatever O
might O
be O
the O
secret O
change O
, O
his O
|
      | O
affection O
for O
her O
, O
to O
judge O
by O
the O
warmth O
, O
and O
agitation O
of O
his O
embrace O
, O
was O
unchanged O
, O
and O
|
      | O
she O
had O
that O
to O
work O
on O
, O
alone O
occupied O
her O
mind O
and O
enabled O
her O
to O
regain O
her O
calmness O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
You O
do O
indeed O
look O
as O

you O
wanted O

and O
home O
nursing O
, O
my O
dear O
boy O
, O
" O
she O
said O
, O
|
      | O
after O
some O
little O
time O
had O
elapsed O
, O
and O
Edward B-PERSON
had O
seated O
himself O
by O
her O
, O
his O
hand O
still O
|
      | O
clasped O
in O
hers O
  O
" O
Sir O
Edward B-PERSON
was O
quite O
right O
to O
invalid O
you O

Emmeline O
does O
nothing O
but O
talk O
of O
|
      | O
your O
wounds O
as O
making O
you O
a O
complete O
hero O
  O
I O
am O
unromantic O
enough O
to O
wish O
that O
you O
had O
brought O
|
      | O
me O
home O
more O
color O
and O
more O
flesh O
, O
and O
less O
glory O
  O
but O
, O
I O
suppose O
from O
being O
so O
pale O
, O
you O
are O
|
      | O
more O
like O
your O
poor O
mother O
than O
ever O

" O
and O
she O
looked O
at O
him O
so O
earnestly O
, O
that O
Edward B-PERSON
's O
eyes O
, O
|
      | O
spite O
of O
all O
his O
efforts O
, O
sunk O
beneath O
hers O
. O
He O
answered O
gayly O
, O
however O
, O
and O
, O
in O
reply O
to O
|
      | O
Caroline B-GPE
's O
numerous O
queries O
, O
entered O
into O
an O
animated O
description O
of O
their O
voyage O
home O
and O
the O
|
      | O
causes O
of O
their O
detention O
, O
in O
their O
being O
so O
often O
compelled O
to O
put O
into O
port O
from O
the O
fearful O
|
      | O
storms O
they O
had O
encountered O
, O
and O
time O
slipped O
away O
so O
fast O
that O
the O
dinner O
- O
bell O
rung O
before O

      | O
any O
one O
was O
prepared O

That O
Ellen B-PERSON

look O
paler O

even O
when O
she O
had O
left O
her O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
and O
be O
still O
|
      | O
more O
silent O
, O
did O
not O
astonish O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
  O
the O
agitation O
of O
meeting O
her O
brother O
was O
quite O
|
      | O
enough O
to O
occasion O
it O
  O
and O
she O
advised O
her O
to O
remain O
quiet O
while O
they O
were O
at O
dinner O
, O
that O
she O
|
      | O
might O
rejoin O
them O
afterward O
. O
She O
looked O
as O
if O
she O
had O
been O
so O
very O
lately O
ill O
, O
that O
Edward B-PERSON
was O
|
      | O
not O
surprised O
at O
her O
having O
dined O
already O
  O
but O
many O
little O
things O
that O
occured O
during O
the O
|
      | O
evening O
— O
her O
excessive O
quietness O
, O
the O
evident O
restraint O
between O
her O
and O
Caroline B-GPE
, O
and O
, O
he O
at O

      | O
first B-ORDINAL
fancied O
, O
and O
then O
was O
quite O
certain O
, O
between O
her O
and O
his O
aunt O
, O
startled O
and O
perplexed O

      | O
him O
. O
She O
seemed O
restrained O
and O
shy O
, O
too O
, O
with O
him O
, O
as O
if O
in O
constant O
terror O

Poor O
child O
! O
her O

      | O
aunt O
had O
advised O
quietness O
while O
alone O
, O

her O
brother O
's O
words O
rung O
in O
her O
ears O
, O
till O
repose O

      | O
seemed O
farther O
off O
than O
ever O

After O
all O
she O
had O
suffered O
before O
, O
and O
after O
the O
sending O
that O

      | O
fatal O
letter O

it O
had O
never O
reached O
him O

utterly O
failed O
in O
her O
attempt O
to O
save O
him O

If O

      | O
she O
had O
, O
indeed O
, O
confided O

first B-ORDINAL

measures O

sure O

her O
uncle O

sent O
him O
his O

the O
risk O
of O
the O
loss O
of O
the O
letter O

      | O
There O
had O
been O
times O
when O
, O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
her O
sufferings O
, O
Ellen B-PERSON
could O
realize O
a O
sort O
of O
|
      | O
comfort O
in O
the O
idea O
that O
she O
had O
saved O
Edward B-PERSON
and O
kept O
his O
secret O
  O
but O
where O
was O
this O
comfort O

      | O
now O
? O
All O
she O
had O
endured O
all O
she O
was O
still O
to O
endure O
, O
was O
for O
nothing O
, O
worse O
than O
nothing O
  O
for O
|
      | O
if O
Edward B-PERSON
knew O
her O
sin O
, O

that O
it O
had O
brought O
him O
no O
good O
, O
and O
given O
up O
, O
as O
she O
felt O
he O

      | O
must O
be O

to O
unrestrained O
passion O
, O

given O
vent O
to O
such O
fearful O
sentiments O
, O

      | O
she O
actually O
trembled O
for O
its O
effect O
upon O
him O
and O
his O
anger O
on O
herself O
. O
She O
had O
sometimes O
|
      | O
fancied O
that O
, O
perhaps O
, O
his O
errors O
were O
not O
so O
great O
as O
he O
believed O
them O
, O
that O
he O
would O
confess O

      | O
them O
when O
he O
found O
only O
his O
kind O

indulgent O
aunt O
at O
home O

so O
peace O

hope O
gradually O
dawn O

for O
both O
him O

her O
. O
All O
her O
wish O

now O
was O
that O
Mrs. O

what O
she O
had O
done O

for O
whether O
it O
made O
him O

he O
ought O
to O
confess O
|
      | O
himself O
its O
cause O
or O
not O
, O
its O
effect O
on O
him O
would O
be O
so O
terrible O
, O
that O
she O
felt O
any O
additional O

      | O
suffering O
to O
herself O
could O
be O
better O
borne O

With O
these O
thoughts O
, O
no O
wonder O
she O
was O
silent O
, O
utterly O
unable O
to O
subdue O
them O
as O
she O
wished O
, O

      | O
and O
evince O
natural O
interest O
in O
all O
that O
had O
occurred O
to O
Edward B-PERSON
  O
and O
tell O
him O
all O
that O
had O

      | O
happened O
to O
herself O
during O
their O
long O
separation O
. O
Caroline B-PERSON
, O
however O
, O
was O
so O
animated O
  O

when O

      | O
Emmeline B-PRODUCT

Miss O
Harcourt B-PERSON
returned O
, O
unable O
to O
comprehend O
what O
they O
could O
possibly O
be O
sent O

      | O
for O
, O
a B-TIME
full I-TIME
hour I-TIME
earlier I-TIME
than O
usual O
, O
the O
astonishment O
and O
delight O
at O
seeing O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
prevented O

      | O
any O
thing O
like O
a O
pause O
in O
conversation O
, O
or O
unnatural O
restraint O
. O
His O
cousins O
found O
so O
much O
to O

      | O
tell O
as O
well O
as O
to O
listen O
to O
, O
about O
Percy B-PERSON

Herbert B-PERSON
, O
as O
well O
as O
themselves O
  O
and O
Emmeline B-ORG

      | O
made O
Edward B-PERSON
tell O
her O
such O
minute O
particulars O
of O
their O
engagements O
with O
the O
pirates O
, O
and O
how O
he O
|
      | O
was O
wounded O
, O
and O
what O
Sir O
Edward B-PERSON
said O
to O
him O
, O
that O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
anxious O
as O
she O
was O
— O
for O
the O
|
      | O
longer O
she O
was O
with O
her O
nephew O
, O
the O
more O
convinced O
she O
was O
that O
he O
could O
not O
meet O
her O
eye O
, O
and O
|
      | O
that O
his O
gayety O
was O
not O
natural O
— O
could O
not O
help O
being O
amused O
in O
spite O
of O
herself O
. O
| 
  | O
Engrossed O
with O
thought O
how O
to O
arrive O
at O
the O
truth O
, O
for O
which O
she O
ardently O
longed O
, O
she O
|
      | O
entered O
the O
library O
, O
when O
the O
prayer O
- O
bell O
rung O
, O
with O
her O
children O
  O
quite O
forgetting O
, O
till O
she O
|
      | O
had O
taken O
the O
place O
at O
the O
reading O
- O
desk O
, O
which O
, O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
her O
husband O
and O
sons O
, O
she O
|
      | O
always O
occupied O
herself O
, O
that O
she O
had O
intended O
to O
desire O
Ellen B-PERSON
to O
resume O
her O
usual O
place O
by O
|
      | O
Emmeline B-ORG
, O
wishing O
to O
spare O
her O
any O
additional O
suffering O
the B-TIME
first I-TIME
night I-TIME
of O
Edward B-PERSON
's O
return O
, O
|
      | O
and O
to O
prevent O
any O
painful O
feeling O
on O
his O
part O
. O
It O
was O
an O
oversight O
, O
but O
it O
vexed O
her O
|
      | O
exceedingly O
. O
She O
looked O
hastily O
round O
, O
in O
the O
hope O
of O
being O
in O
time O
, O
but O
Ellen B-PERSON
was O
already O
in O
|
      | O
her O
place O
, O
though O
she O
had O
evidently O
shrunk O
still O
more O
into O
the O
recess O
of O
the O
lower O
window O
, O
as O
|
      | O
if O
longing O
for O
its O
massive O
curtains O
to O
hide O
her O
, O
and O
her O
face O
was O
buried O
in O
her O
hands O
. O
Mrs. O
|
      | O
Hamilton B-PERSON
would O
have O
been O
still O
more O
grieved O
, O
if O
she O
had O
seen O
, O
as O
Ellis B-ORG
did O
, O
the O
beseeching O
, O
|
      | O
humble O
look O
, O
which O
, O
as O
they O
entered O
, O
Ellen B-PERSON
had O
fixed O
upon O
her O
, O
and O
that O
her O
pale O
lips O
had O
|
      | O
quivered O
with O
the O
half B-CARDINAL
- O
uttered O
supplication O
, O
which O
she O
failed O
in O
courage O
to O
fully O
pronounce O
. O
|
      | O
Edward B-PERSON
appeared O
too O
wrapped O
in O
his O
own O
thoughts O
to O
notice O
it O
then O
  O
and O
as O
his O
aunt O
's O
gentle O
|
      | O
but O
impressive O
voice O
fell O
on O
his O
fear O
, O
the O
words O
, O
the O
room O
, O
the O
whole O
scene O
so O
recalled O
the O
|
      | O
happy O
, O
and O
comparatively O
innocent O
past O
, O
that O
it O
was O
with O
difficulty O
he O
could O
restrain O
his O
|
      | O
feelings O
, O
till O
the O
attitude O
of O
kneeling O
permitted O
them O
full O
vent O
in O
tears O
, O
actual O
tears O
, O
when O
|
      | O
he O
had O
thought O
he O
could O
never O
weep O
again O
. O
The O
contrast O
of O
his O
past O
and O
present O
self O
, O
rendered O
|
      | O
the O
one B-CARDINAL
more O
brightly O
happy O
, O
the O
other O
more O
intensely O
dark O
than O
the O
actual O
reality O
. O
The O
|
      | O
unchecked O
faults O
and O
passions O
of O
his O
early O
childhood O
had O
been O
the O
sole O
cause O
of O
his O
present O
|
      | O
errors O
  O
but O
, O
while O
under O
the O
gentle O
control O
of O
his O
aunt O
and O
uncle O
, O
and O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
, O
he O
had O
not O
|
      | O
known O
these O
faults O
, O
and O
, O
therefore O
, O
believed O
they O
had O
all O
come O
since O
. O
He O
longed O
intensely O
to O
|
      | O
confide O
all O
his O
errors O
, O
all O
his O
remorse O
, O
to O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
, O
whom O
he O
still O
so O
dearly O
loved O
  O
but O
he O
|
      | O
knew O
he O
had O
not O
courage O
to O
confess O
, O
and O
yet O
hated O
himself O
for O
his O
cowardice O
. O
| 
  | O
Only O
too O
well O
accustomed O
to O
control O
, O
he O
banished O
every O
trace O
of O
tears O
( O
from O
all O
save O
the O
eye O
|
      | O
rendered O
even O
more O
than O
usually O
penetrating O
from O
anxiety O
) O
, O
as O
he O
arose O
, O
and O
became O
aware O
, O
for O
|
      | O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
, O
that O
Ellen B-PERSON
was O
not O
where O
he O
was O
accustomed O
to O
see O
her O
. O
He O
kissed O
her O
fondly O
as O
|
      | O
she O
hurriedly O
approached O
him O
  O
but O
perceiving O
she O
left O
the O
room O
with O
merely O
a O
faint O
good O
- O
night O

to O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
family O
, O
and O
no O
embrace O
, O
as O
usual O
, O
from O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
he O
darted O
forward O
, O
|
      | O
seized O
his O
aunt O
's O
hand O
, O
and O
exclaimed O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
What O
is O
the O
matter O
with O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
aunt O
Emmeline B-PERSON
? O
Why O
is O
she O
so O
changed O
, O
and O
why O
is O
your O
manner O
|
      | O
to O
her O
so O
cold O
and O
distant O
? O
and O
why O
did O
she O
kneel O
apart O
, O
as O
if O
unworthy O
to O
join O
us O
even O
in O
|
      | O
prayers O
? O
Tell O
me O

for O
pity O

sake O

" O

" O
Not O
to O
- O
night O
, O
my O
dear O
Edward B-PERSON
. O
It O
is O
a O
long O
tale O
, O
and O
a O
painful O
one O
, O

I O
rely O
on O

        | O
you O

to O
help O
me O
, O
that O
Ellen B-PERSON
and O
myself O
may O
be O
again O
as O
we O
have O
been O

It O
is O
as O
much O

      | O
pain O
to O
me O
as O
to O
her O
that O
we O
are O
not O

To O
- O

I O
promise O
you O

you O

excitement O
enough O
for O

day O

after O
your O
exhausting O
voyage O
must O
need O
rest O

not O

      | O
fancy O
this O
an O
evasion O
of O
your O
request O

have O
longed O
for O
your O
return O

      | O
almost O
as O

for O
the O
happiness O
of O
seeing O
you O
again O

" O
| 
  | O
Edward B-PERSON
was O
compelled O
to O
be O
satisfied O

retire O
  O

though O
he O
did O
feel O
sufficient O
physical O

      | O
exhaustion O
, O
for O
the O
comfort O
of O
his O
room O

be O
unusually O
luxurious O
, O
his O
sleep O
was O
restless O

      | O
disturbed O
by O
frightful O
dreams O
, O
in O
which O
, O
however O
varied O
the O

it O
always O
seemed O
that O
he O

was O
in O
danger O

Ellen B-PERSON
sacrificing O
herself O

On O
retiring O
for O
the B-TIME
night I-TIME
, O
Mrs. O

discovered O
a O
note O
on O
her O
dressing O
- O
table O

She O

      | O
thought O
she O
knew O
the O
writing O

but O
from O
tremulousness O
it O
was O
so O
nearly O
illegible O
, O
that O
it O
was O
|
      | O
with O
great O
difficulty O
she O
deciphered O
the O
following O
words O
: O

She O
locked O
up O
the O
note O
, O
which O
she O
would O
not O

      | O
read O
again O
, O
fearing O
its O
deep O
humility O
, O
its O
earnest O
supplication O

would O
turn O
her O
from O
her O

purpose O
, O
and O
in O
praying O
fervently O
for O
guidance O

fitful O
sleep O
her O
night O
passed O

For O
some O
time O
after O
breakfast O
the B-TIME
following I-TIME
morning I-TIME
, O
Edward B-PERSON
and O
his O
aunt O
were O
alone O
together O
|
      | O
in O
the O
library O
. O
It O
was O
with O
the O
utmost O
difficulty O
, O
he O
suppressed O
, O
sufficiently O
to O
conceal O
, O
the O
|
      | O
fearful O
agitation O
which O
thrilled O
through O
every O
nerve O
as O
he O
listened O
to O
the O
tale O
he O
had O
|
      | O
demanded O
. O
He O
could O
not O
doubt O
the O
use O
to O
which O
that O
money O
had O
been O
applied O
. O
His O
sister O
's O
|
      | O
silence O
alone O
would O
have O
confirmed O
it O
  O
but O
in O
that B-TIME
hour I-TIME
of O
madness O
— O
for O
what O
else O
is O
passion O
|
      | O
unrestrained O
by O
principle O
or O
feeling?—he B-PRODUCT
was O
only O
conscious O
of O
anger O
, O
fierce O
anger O
against O
the O
|
      | O
unhappy O
girl O
who O
had O
borne O
so O
much O
for O
him O
. O
He O
had O
utterly O
forgotten O
the O
desperate O
words O
he O
|
      | O
had O
written O
. O
He O
had O
never O
received O
the O
intended O
relief O
. O
Till O
within O
a B-DATE
week I-DATE
, O
a B-DATE
short I-DATE
week I-DATE
of O
|
      | O
his O
return O
, O
he O
had O
been O
in O
Harding B-PERSON
's O
power O
, O
and O
as O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
devotion O
had O
saved O
him O
nothing O
, O
|
      | O
what O
could O
it O
weigh O
against O
the O
maddening O
conviction O
, O
that O
if O
he O
had O
one B-CARDINAL
spark O
of O
honor O
|
      | O
remaining O
, O
he O
|  | O
must O
|  | O
confess O
that O
he O
had O
caused O
her O
sin O
? O
Instead O
of O
saving O
, O
she O
had O
|
      | O
betrayed O
him O
  O
and O
he O
left O
his O
aunt O
to O
seek O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
so O
evidently O
disturbed O
and O
heated O
, O
and O
the O
|
      | O
interview O
itself O
had O
been O
so O
little O
satisfactory O
in O
softening O
him O
, O
as O
, O
she O
had O
hoped O
to O
win O
|
      | O
him O
to O
confession O
at O
once O
, O
for O
she O
had O
purposely O
spoken O
as O
indulgently O
of O
error O
and O
difficulty O
|
      | O
as O
she O
could O
, O
without O
betraying O
her O
strengthened O
suspicions O
, O
that O
if O
she O
had O
known O
how O
to O
do O
|
      | O
so O
, O
she O
would O
have O
forbidden O
his O
seeing O
Ellen B-PERSON
till O
he O
was O
more O
calm O
. O
| 
  | O
Unhappily O
, O
too O
, O
it O
was O
that O
part O
of O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
when O
Ellis B-PERSON
was O
always O
most O
engaged O
, O
and O
she O
was O
|
      | O
not O
even O
in O
her O
own O
room O
, O
so O
that O
there O
was O
no O
check O
on O
Edward B-PERSON
's O
violence O
. O
The O
control O
he O
had O
|
      | O
exercised O
while O
with O
his O
aunt O
but O
increased O
passion O
when O
it O
was O
removed O
. O
He O
poured O
forth O
the O
|
      | O
bitterest O
reproaches O
— O
asked O
how O
she O
could O
dare O
hope O
relief O
so O
obtained O
, O
would O
ever O
have O
been O
|
      | O
allowed O
to O
reach O
him?—what O
had O
she O
done O
but O
betrayed O
him O
? O
for O
how O
could O
he O
be O
such O
a O
|
      | O
dishonored O
coward O
as O
to O
let O
her O
leave O
Oakwood B-ORG
because O
she O
would O
not O
speak O
? O
and O
why O
had O
she O
not O
|
      | O
spoken?—why O
not O
betrayed O
him O
at O
once O
, O
and O
not O
decoyed O
him O
home O
to O
disgrace O
and O
misery O
? O
Passion O
|
      | O
had O
so O
maddened O
him O
that O
he O
neither O
knew O
what O
he O
said O
himself O
, O
nor O
heard O
her O
imploring O
|
      | O
entreaties O
not O
to O
betray O
himself O
and O
she O
never O
would O
. O
She O
clung O
to O
his O
knees O
as O
she O
kneeled O
|
      | O
before O
him O
, O
for O
she O
was O
too O
powerless O
to O
stand O
, O
reiterating O
her O
supplication O
in O
a O
tone O
that O
|
      | O
ought O
to O
have O
recalled O
him O
to O
his O
better O
self O
, O
but O
that O
better O
self O
had O
been O
too O
long O
|
      | O
silenced O
, O
and O
infuriated O
at O
her O
convulsive O
efforts O
to O
detain O
him O
, O
he O
struck O
her O
with O
|
      | O
sufficient O
force O
to O
make O
her O
, O
more O
by O
the O
agony O
of O
a O
blow O
from O
him O
, O
than O
the O
pain O
itself O
, O
|
      | O
loose O
her O
hold O
at O
once O
, O
and O
darted O
from O
the O
room O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
hall O
door O
was O
open O
, O
and O
he O
rushed O
through O
it O
unseen O
into O
the O
park O
, O
flying O
he O
neither O
|
      | O
knew O
where O
nor O
cared O
, O
but O
plunging O
into O
the O
wildest O
parts O
. O
How O
he O
arrived O
at O
one B-CARDINAL
particular O
|
      | O
spot O
he O
knew O
not O
, O
for O
it O
was O
one O
which O
of O
all O
others O
, O
in O
that O
moment O
of O
excitement O
, O
he O
would O
|
      | O
gladly O
have O
avoided O
. O
It O
was O
a O
small O
glade O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
the O
wood O
, O
shelving O
down O
to O
the O
|
      | O
water O
's O
edge O
, O
where O
he O
and O
Percy B-PERSON
, O
with O
the O
assistance O
of O
Robert B-PERSON
, O
had O
been O
permitted O
to O
erect O
a O
|
      | O
miniature O
boat O
- O
house O
, O
and O
where O
Edward B-PERSON
had O
kept O
a O
complete O
flotilla O
of O
tiny O
vessels O
. O
There O
|
      | O
were O
the O
trees O
, O
the O
glade O
, O
the O
boat O
- O
house O
still O
, O
aye O
, O
and O
the O
vessels O
, O
in O
such O
beautiful O
|
      | O
repair O
and O
keeping O
, O
that O
it O
brought O
back O
the O
past O
so O
vividly O
, O
so O
overpoweringly O
, O
from O
the O
|
      | O
voiceless O
proof O
which O
it O
was O
of O
the O
affectionate O
remembrance O
with O
which O
he O
and O
his O
favorite O
|
      | O
tastes O
had O
been O
regarded O
, O
even O
in O
his O
absence O
, O
that O
he O
could O
not O
bear O
it O
. O
He O
flung O
himself O
|
      | O
full O
length O
on O
the O
greensward O
, O
and O
as O
thought O
after O
thought O
came O
back O
upon O
him O
, O
bringing O
Ellen B-PERSON
|
      | O
before O
him O
, O
self O
- O
sacrificing O
, O
devoted O
, O
always O
interposing O
between O
him O
and O
anger O
, O
as O
she O
had O
|
      | O
done O
from O
the B-TIME
first I-TIME
hour I-TIME
they O
had O
been O
inmates O
of O
Oakwood B-ORG
, O
the O
thought O
of O
that O
craven B-PERSON
blow I-PERSON
, O
|
      | O
those O
mad O
reproaches O
, O
was O
insupportable O
  O
and O
he O
sobbed O
for O
nearly B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour I-TIME
in O
that O
one O
spot O
, O
|
      | O
longing O
that O
some O
chance O
would O
but O
bring O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
to O
him O
, O
that O
he O
might O
relieve O
that O
fearful O
|
      | O
remorse O
at O
once O
  O
but O
utterly O
unable O
to O
seek O
him O
of O
himself O
. O
| 
  | O
Edward B-PERSON
's O
disposition O
, O
like O
his O
mother O
's O
, O
was O
naturally O
much O
too O
good O
for O
the O
determined O
|
      | O
pursuit O
of O
evil O
. O
His O
errors O
had O
actually O
been O
much O
less O
grave O
, O
than O
from O
Harding B-PERSON
's O
artful O
|
      | O
representations O
he O
imagined O
them O
. O
He O
never O
indulged O
in O
passion O
without O
its O
being O
followed O
by O
|
      | O
the O
most O
agonized O
remorse O
  O
but O
from O
having O
pertinaciously O
banished O
the O
religion O
which O
his O
aunt O
|
      | O
had O
so O
tried O
to O
instill O
, O
and O
been O
taught O
by O
Harding B-PERSON
to O
scoff O
at O
the O
only O
safe O
guide O
for O
youth O
, O
|
      | O
as O
for O
every O
age O
, O
God O
's O
holy O
word O
, O
he O
had O
nothing O
whereon O
to O
lean O
, O
either O
as O
a O
comfort O
in O
his O
|
      | O
remorse O
, O
a O
hope O
for O
amendment O
, O
or O
strength O
for O
self O
- O
conquest O
  O
and O
terrible O
indeed O
might O
have O
|
      | O
been O
the O
consequences O
of O
Harding B-PERSON
's O
fatal O
influence O
, O
if O
the O
influence O
of O
a O
home O
of O
love O
had O
not O
|
      | O
been O
still O
stronger O
. O
| 
  | O
Two B-TIME
hours I-TIME
after O
he O
had O
quitted O
his O
aunt O
, O
he O
rejoined O
the O
family O
, O
tranquil O
, O
but O
bearing O
such O
|
      | O
evident O
traces O
of O
a O
mental O
struggle O
, O
at O
least O
so O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
fancied O
, O
for O
no O
one O
else O
|
      | O
noticed O
it O
, O
that O
she O
still O
hoped O
she O
did O
not O
exactly O
know O
what O
, O
for O
she O
failed O
in O
courage O
to O
|
      | O
ask O
the O
issue O
of O
his O
interview O
with O
Ellen B-PERSON
. O
She O
contented O
herself O
with O
desiring O
Emmeline B-PERSON
to O
|
      | O
tell O
her O
cousin O
to O
bring O
her O
work O
or O
drawing O
, O
and O
join O
them O
, O
and O
she O
was O
so O
surprised O
, O
when O
|
      | O
Emmeline B-PRODUCT
brought O
back O
word O
that O
Ellen B-PERSON
had O
said O
she O
had O
much O
rather O
not O
, O
that O
she O
sought O
her O
|
      | O
herself O
. O
| 
  | O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
cheeks O
, O
in O
general O
so O
pale O
, O
were O
crimson O
, O
her O
eyes O
in O
consequence O
unnaturally O
|
      | O
brilliant O
, O
and O
she O
looked O
altogether O
so O
unlike O
herself O
, O
that O
her O
aunt O
was O
more O
anxious O
than O
|
      | O
ever O
  O
nor O
did O
her O
manner O
when O
asked O
why O
she O
refused O
to O
join O
them O
, O
when O
Edward B-PERSON
had O
so O
lately O
|
      | O
returned O
, O
tend O
to O
decrease O
the O
feeling O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Emmeline B-PRODUCT
did O
not O
say O
|  | O
you O
|  | O
desired O
it O
, O
or O
I O
should O
have O
known O
better O
than O
disobey O
, O
" O
|
      | O
was O
her O
reply O
, O
and O
it O
was O
scarcely O
disrespectful O
  O
the O
tone O
seemed O
that O
of O
a O
spirit O
, O
crushed O
|
      | O
and O
goaded O
to O
the O
utmost O
, O
and O
so O
utterly O
unable O
to O
contend O
more O
, O
though O
every O
nerve O
was O
|
      | O
quivering O
with O
pain O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
felt O
bitter O
pain O
that O
Ellen B-PERSON
at O
length O
did O
indeed O
shrink O
|
      | O
from O
her O
  O
that O
the O
disregard O
of O
her O
entreaty O
concerning O
her O
brother O
appeared O
so O
to O
have O
|
      | O
wounded O
, O
that O
it O
had O
shaken O
the O
affection O
which O
no O
other O
suffering O
had O
had O
power O
to O
move O
. O

" O
I O

it O

she O
replied O

mildly O
  O
" O
you O
are O
of O

did O
not O

could O

suppose O

happy O

away O

only O

      | O
favor O

asked O
you O
before O
I O
went O
, O
" O
answered O
poor O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
and O
the O
voice O
, O
which O
had O
been O
|
      | O
unnaturally O
clear O
, O
was O
choked O
for O
the O
moment O
with O
sobs O
, O
which O
she O
resolutely O
forced O
back O
. O
Mrs. O

      | O
Hamilton B-PERSON
could O
scarcely O
bear O
it O
  O
taking O
her O
ice O
- O
cold O
hands O
in O
both O
hers O
, O
she O
said O
, O
almost O
|
      | O
tenderly O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
You O
have O
reason O
to O
condemn O
me O
as O
harsh O
and O
cruel O
Ellen B-PERSON
  O
but O
time O
will O
perhaps O
explain O
the O
|
      | O
motives O
of O
my O
conduct O
, O
as O
I O
trust O
and O
pray O
it O
will O
solve O
the O
mystery O
of O
yours O
  O
you O
are O
not O

      | O
well O
enough O
to O
be O
left O
long O
alone O
, O
and O
Ellis B-PERSON
is O
so O
much O
engaged O
to O
- O
day O
that O
I O
do O
wish O
you O
to O

      | O
be O
with O
me O
, O
independent O
of O
your O
brother O

society O
. O
If O
you O
so O
much O
prefer O
remaining O
here O
, O
I O
|
      | O
will O
stay O
with O
you O
, O
though O
of O
course O
, O
as O
Edward B-PERSON
has O
been O
away O
from O
us O
so O
long O
, O
I O
should O
wish O

      | O
to O
be O
with O
him O
also O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
It O
was O
almost O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
had O
ever O
had O
recourse O
in O
the O
management O
of O
her O
|
      | O
family O
to O
any O
thing O
that O
was O
not O
perfectly O
straightforward O
  O
and O
though O
her O
present O
motives O
|
      | O
would O
have O
hallowed O
much O
deeper O
stratagems O
, O
her O
pure O
mind O
shrunk O
from O
her O
own O
words O
. O
She O
|
      | O
wished O
Ellen B-PERSON
to O
be O
constantly O
in O
Edward B-PERSON
's O
presence O
, O
that O
he O
might O
not O
be O
able O
to O
evade O
the O
|
      | O
impulse O
of O
feeling O
and O
honor O
, O
which O
the O
sight O
of O
such O
suffering O
, O
she O
thought O
, O
must O
call O
forth O
  O
|
      | O
she O
could O
not O
bear O
to O
enforce O
this O
wish O
as O
a O
command O
, O
when O
she O
had O
already O
been O
, O
as O
she O
|
      | O
felt O
— O
if O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
silence O
were O
indeed O
self O
- O
devotion O
, O
not O
guilt O
— O
so O
cruelly O
and O
so O
unnecessarily O
|
      | O
severe O
. O
Ellen O
made O
neither O
reply O
nor O
resistance O
, O
but O
, O
taking O
up O
her O
work O
, O
accompanied O
her O
aunt O

      | O
to O
the O
usual O
morning O
- O
room O
, O
from O
which O
many O
a O
burst O
of O
happy O
laughter O
, O
and O
joyous O
tones O
were O
|
      | O
echoing O
. O
Caroline B-PERSON
and O
Emmeline B-PERSON
were O
so O
full O
of O
enjoyment O
at O
Edward B-PERSON
's O
return O
, O
had O
so O
many O
|
      | O
things O
to O
ask O
and O
tell O
, O
were O
so O
perfectly O
unsuspicious O
as O
to O
his O
having O
any O
concern O
with O
his O
|
      | O
sister O
's O
fault O
, O
that O
if O
they O
did O
once O
or O
twice O
think O
him O
less O
lively O
and O
joyous O
, O
than O
when O
he O

      | O
left O
home O
, O
they O
attributed O
it O
simply O
, O
to O
his O
not O
having O
yet O
recovered O
the O
exhausting O
voyage O
|
      | O
and O
his O
wounds O
. O
Miss O
Harcourt B-GPE
, O
just O
as O
unsuspicious O
, O
secretly O
accused O
Ellen B-PERSON
as O
the O
cause O
of O
|
      | O
his O
occasional O
abstraction O
: O
her O
conduct O
was O
not O
likely O
to O
pass O
unfelt O
by O
one O
so O
upright O
, O
so O
|
      | O
honorable O
, O
and O
if O
he O
had O
been O
harsh O
with O
her O
, O
as O
from O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
fearfully O
shrinking O
manner O
, O
and O
|
      | O
complete O
silence O
when O
they O
were O
together O
, O
she O
fancied O
, O
she O
thought O
it O
was O
so O
deserved O
, O
that O

      | O
she O
had O
no O
pity O
for O
her O
whatever O

The B-DATE
day I-DATE
passed O
briskly O

happily O
enough O
, O
in O

seeming O

to O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON

Edward B-PERSON
, O

      | O
in O
reality O
to O
all O
the O
other O
members O
of O
the O
party O
— O
but O
one O
. O
The O
great O
subject O
of O
regret O
was O
Mr. O
|
      | O
Howard B-PERSON
's O
absence O
, O
he O
might O
be O
back O
at O
the O
rectory O
that O
evening B-TIME
, O
and O
Emmeline B-PERSON
was O
sure O
he O
would O
|
      | O
come O
to O
see O
Edward B-PERSON
directly O
. O
As O
the B-TIME
hours I-TIME
waned O
, O
Ellen B-PERSON
became O
sensible O
of O
a O
sharp O
and O
most O
|
      | O
unusual O
pain O
darting O
through O
her O
temples O
, O
and O
gradually O
extending O
over O
her O
forehead O
and O
head O
, O
|
      | O
till O
she O
could O
scarcely O
move O
her O
eyes O
. O
It O
had O
come O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
so O
suddenly O
, O
and O
lasting O
so O
short O
|
      | O
a O
time O
, O
that O
she O
could O
scarcely O
define O
what O
it O
was O
, O
or O
why O
she O
should O
have O
felt O
so O
suddenly O
|
      | O
sick O
and O
faint O
  O
but O
it O
increased O
, O
till O
there O
was O
no O
difficulty O
in O
tracing O
it O
, O
and O
before O
|
      | O
prayer O
- O
time O
, O
had O
become O
such O
fearful O
agony O
, O
that O
, O
if O
she O
had O
not O
been O
inured O
to O
pain O
of O
all O
|
      | O
kinds O
, O
and O
endowed O
with O
extraordinary O
fortitude O
and O
control O
, O
she O
must O
more O
than O
once O
have O
|
      | O
betrayed O
it O
by O
either O
giving O
way O
to O
faintness O
, O
or O
screaming O
aloud O
. O
She O
had O
overheard O
Mrs. O
|
      | O
Hamilton B-PERSON
desire O
Robert B-PERSON
to O
request O
Mr. O
Maitland B-PERSON
to O
come O
to O
Oakwood B-ORG
as O
soon O
as O
he O
could O
, O
and O
not O
|
      | O
hearing O
the O
reply O
that O
he O
was O
not O
expected O
home O
till O
late B-TIME
at I-TIME
night I-TIME
, O
expected O
him O
every O
moment O
, O
|
      | O
and O
thought O
he O
would O
give O
her O
something O
to O
relieve O
it O
, O
without O
her O
complaining O
. O
| 
  | O
Edward B-PERSON
had O
asked O
his O
cousins O
for O
some O
music O
, O
and O
then O
to O
please O
Emmeline B-ORG
, O
had O
sketched O
the O
|
      | O
order O
of O
their O
engagement O
with O
the O
pirates O
, O
and O
no O
one O
noticed O
her O
, O
for O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
's O
heart O
|
      | O
was O
sinking O
with O
disappointed O
hope O
, O
as O
the B-TIME
hours I-TIME
passed O
, O
and O
there O
was O
no O
sign O
to O
prove O
that O
|
      | O
her O
surmise O
was O
correct O
, O
and O
if O
it O
were O
, O
that O
the O
truth O
would O
be O
obtained O
. O

  | O
The O
prayer O
- O
bell O
rang O
, O
and O
as O
they O
rose O
, O
Edward B-PERSON
's O
eyes O
, O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
since O
she O
had O
|
      | O
joined O
them O
, O
sought O
and O
fixed O
themselves O
on O
his O
sister O
's O
face O
. O
The O
paroxysm O
of O
pain O
had O
for O
a B-TIME
|
      | I-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
subsided O
, O
as O
it O
had O
done O
alternately O
with O
violence O
all B-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
but O
it O
had O
left O
her O
so O
|
      | O
ghastly O
pale O
, O
that O
he O
started O
in O
actual O
terror O
. O
It O
might O
have O
been O
fancy O
, O
but O
he O
thought O
there O
|
      | O
was O
the O
trace O
of O
his O
cowardly O
blow O
on O
her O
pale O
forehead O
, O
raised O
, O
and O
black O
, O
and O
such O
a O
feeling O
|
      | O
of O
agony O
and O
remorse O
rushed O
over O
him O
, O
that O
it O
was O
with O
difficulty O
he O
restrained O
himself O
from O
|
      | O
catching O
her O
in O
his O
arms O
, O
and O
beseeching O
her O
forgiveness O
before O
them O
all O
  O
but O
there O
was O
no O
|
      | O
time O
then O
, O
and O
they O
proceeded O
to O
the O
library O
. O
Every O
step O
Ellen B-PERSON
took O
appeared O
to O
bring O
back O
|
      | O
that O
fearful O
pain O
, O
till O
as O
she O
sat O
down O
, O
and O
then O
knelt O
in O
her O
place O
, O
she O
was O
sensible O
of O
|
      | O
nothing O
else O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
service O
was O
over O
  O
and O
as O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
rose O
from O
the O
private O
prayer O
, O
with O
which O
each O
|
      | O
individual O
concluded O
his O
devotions O
, O
her O
nephew O
stood O
before O
her O
, O
white O
as O
marble O
, O
but O
with O
an O
|
      | O
expression O
of O
fixed O
resolution O
, O
which O
made O
her O
heart O
bound O
up O
with O
hope O
, O
at O
the O
very O
moment O
it O
|
      | O
turned O
sick O
and O
faint O
with O
terror O
. O
| 
  | O
Several O
of O
the O
lower O
domestics O
had O
quitted O
the O
library O
before O
Edward B-PERSON
regained O
voice O
, O
and O
his O
|
      | O
first B-ORDINAL
word O
, O
or O
rather O
action O
, O
was O
to O
desire O
those O
that O
remained O
to O
stay O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
My O
sister O
has O
been O
disgraced O
, O
exposed O
before O
you O
all O
" O
he O
exclaimed O
, O
in O
a O
tone O
of O
misery O
and O
|
      | O
determination O
, O
that O
so O
startled O
Miss O
Harcourt B-PERSON
and O
his O
cousins O
, O
they O
gazed O
at O
him O
bewildered O
, O
|
      | O
" O
and O
before O
you O
all O
must O
be O
her O
exculpation O
. O
It O
was O
less O
for O
her O
sin O
than O
her O
silence O
, O
and O
for O
|
      | O
the O
increased O
guilt O
which O
that O
appeared O
to O
conceal O
, O
you O
tell O
me O
, O
she O
has O
been O
so O
severely O
|
      | O
treated O
. O
Aunt B-PERSON
Emmeline I-PERSON
, O
I O
am O
the O
cause O
of O
her O
silence O
— O
I O
was O
the O
tempter O
to O
her O
sin O
— O
I O
have O
|
      | O
deceived O
my O
commander O
, O
deceived O
my O
officers O
, O
deceived O
you O
all O

and O
instead O
of O
being O
what O
you O

      | O
believe O
me O
, O
am O
a O
gambler O
and O
a O
villain O

She O
has O
saved O
me O
again O
and O
again O
from O
discovery O
and O

      | O
disgrace O
, O
and O
but O
for O
her O
sin O

its O

For O
a B-TIME

after O

startling O
words O

was O
silence O

Emmeline B-PRODUCT

first B-ORDINAL
thought O

only O
joy O

that O

was O
not O
so O

      | O
guilty O
as O
it O
seemed O
. O
Edward B-PERSON
had O
crossed O
his O

buried O
his O
face O

them O

The O
instantaneous O
change O
of O
sentiment O

his O
confession O
excited O

looked O

Ellis B-GPE

she O

remove O

clasped O

burning O

ILLNESS O
AND O
REMORSE O
. O
| 
  | O
It O
was O
indeed O
a O
fearful O
night O
which O
followed O
the O
close O
of O
our O
last O
chapter O
. O
Illness O
, O
|
      | O
sufficient O
to O
occasion O
anxiety O
, O
both O
in O
Herbert B-PERSON
and O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
had O
been O
often O
an O
inmate O
of O
|
      | O
Oakwood B-ORG
, O
but O
it O
had O
merely O
called O
for O
care O
, O
and O
all O
those O
kindly O
sympathies O
, O
which O
render O
|
      | O
indisposition O
sometimes O
an O
actual O
blessing O
, O
both O
to O
those O
who O
suffer O
and O
those O
who O
tend O
. O
But O
|
      | O
illness O
, O
appearing O
to O
be O
but O
the O
ghastly O
vehicle O
of O
death O
, O
clothed O
in O
such O
fearful O
pain O
that O
|
      | O
no O
control O
, O
even O
of O
reason O
and O
strong O
will O
, O
can O
check O
its O
agonized O
expression O
, O
till O
at O
last O
, O
|
      | O
reason O
itself O
succumbs O
beneath O
it O
, O
and O
bears O
the O
mind O
from O
the O
tortured O
frame O
, O
this O
is O
a O
trial O
|
      | O
of O
no O
ordinary O
suffering O
, O
even O
when O
such O
illness O
has O
been O
brought O
about O
by O
what O
may O
be O
termed O
|
      | O
natural O
causes O
. O
But O
when O
it O
follows O
, O
nay O
, O
springs O
from O
mental O
anguish O
, O
when O
the O
sad O
watchers O
|
      | O
feel O
that O
it O
might O
have O
been O
averted O
, O
that O
it O
is O
the O
consequence O
of O
mistaken O
treatment O
, O
and O
it O
|
      | O
comes O
to O
the O
young O
, O
to O
whom O
such O
sorrow O
ought O
to O
be O
a O
thing O
unknown O
, O
was O
it O
marvel O
that O
Mrs. O
|
      | O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
as O
she O
stood O
by O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
bed O
, O
watching O
the O
alternations O
of O
deathlike O
insensibility O
|
      | O
with O
paroxysms O
of O
pain O
, O
which O
nothing O
could O
relieve O
( O
for O
it O
was O
only O
the O
commencement O
of O
brain O
|
      | O
fever O
) O
, O
felt O
as O
if O
she O
had O
indeed O
never O
known O
grief O
or O
anxiety O
before O
. O
She O
had O
looked O
forward O
|
      | O
to O
Edward B-PERSON
's O
confession O
bringing O
hope O
and O
rest O
to O
all O
  O
that O
the O
aching O
head O
and O
strained O
nerves O
|
      | O
of O
her O
poor O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
only O
needed O
returning O
love O
, O
and O
the O
quietness O
of O
assured O
forgiveness O
for O
|
      | O
herself O
and O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
for O
health O
and O
happiness O
gradually O
to O
return O
  O
and O
the O
shock O
of O
such O
sudden O
|
      | O
and O
terrible O
illness O
, O
betraying O
, O
as O
it O
did O
, O
an O
extent O
of O
previous O
mental O
suffering O
, O
which O
she O
|
      | O
had O
not O
conceived O
as O
possible O
in O
one O
so O
young O
, O
almost O
unnerved O
her O
. O
But O
hers O
was O
not O
a O
|
      | O
character O
to O
give O
way O
  O
the O
anguish O
she O
experienced O
might O
be O
read O
in O
the O
almost O
stern O
quiet O
of O
|
      | O
her O
face O
, O
in O
her O
gentle O
but O
firm O
resistance O
to O
every O
persuasion O
to O
move O
from O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
bed O
, O
not O
|
      | O
only O
through O
that O
dreadful O
night O
, O
but O
for O
the B-DATE
week I-DATE
which O
followed O
. O
The O
idea O
of O
death O
was O
|
      | O
absolute O
agony O
  O
none O
but O
her O
God O
knew O
the O
struggle O
, O
day O
after O
day O
, O
night O
after O
night B-TIME
, O
which O
|
      | O
she O
endured O
, O
to O
compel O
her O
rebellious O
spirit O
to O
submission O
to O
His O
will O
, O
whatever O
it O
might O
be O
. O
|
      | O
She O
knew O
earth B-LOC
's O
dearest O
, O
most O
unalloyed O
happiness O
could O
not O
compare O
with O
that O
of O
Heaven O
, O
if O
|
      | O
indeed O
it O
should O
be O
His O
pleasure O
to O
recall O
her O
  O
but O
the O
thought O
|  | O
would O
not O
|  | O
bring O
|
      | O
peace O
. O
She O
had O
no O
reason O
to O
reproach O
herself O
, O
for O
she O
had O
acted O
only O
as O
imperative O
duty O
|
      | O
demanded O
, O
and O
it O
had O
caused O
her O
almost O
as O
much O
misery O
as O
Ellen B-PERSON
. O
But O
yet O
the O
thought O
would O
not O
|
      | O
leave O
her O
, O
that O
her O
harshness O
and O
cruelty O
had O
caused O
all O
the O
suffering O
she O
beheld O
. O
She O
did O
not O
|
      | O
utter O
those O
thoughts O
aloud O
, O
she O
did O
not O
dare O
give O
words O
to O
that O
deep O
wretchedness O
, O
for O
she O
|
      | O
felt O
her O
only O
sustaining O
strength O
was O
in O
her O
God O
. O
The O
only O
one O
who O
would O
have O
read O
her O
heart O
, O
|
      | O
and O
given O
sympathy O
, O
strength O
, O
comfort O
, O
without O
a O
word O
from O
her O
, O
her O
husband O
, O
was O
far O
away O
, O
and O
|
      | O
she O
dared O
not O
sink O
  O
though O
there O
were O
times O
when O
heart O
and O
frame O
felt O
so O
utterly O
exhausted O
, O
it O

      | O
seemed O
at O
if O
she O
must O

| 
  | O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
's O
presence O
had O
been O
an O
inexpressible O
relief O
. O
" O
Go O
to O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
my O
dear O
friend O
, O
" O
she O
|
      | O
had O
said O
, O
as O
he O
lingered O
beside O
the O
bed O
where O
Ellen B-PERSON
had O
been O
laid O
, O
longing O
to O
comfort O
, O
but O
|
      | O
feeling O
at O
such O
a O
moment O
it O
was O
impossible O
  O
" O
he O
wants O
you O
more O
than O

Not O
understanding O
her O
, O
except O
that O
Edward B-PERSON
must O
be O
naturally O
grieved O
at O
his O
sister O

illness O
, O
|
      | O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
sought O
him O
, O

found O
him O
still O
in O
the O
library O
, O
almost O
in O
the O
same O
spot O
. O

" O

sad O
welcome O

kindly O
laying O

on O

shoulder O

" O

answered O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
raising O
his O
head O
, O
and O

      | O
startling O
Mr. O

both O
by O
his O
tone O

      | O
once O

up O

Harding B-PERSON
became O
more O

of O

      | O
course O

But O
when O
he O
tried O

make O
him O
a O
sharer O

conniver O
in O

Harding B-PERSON

He O

      | O
knew O
when O
to O
bring O
wine O
to O
the O
billiard O

, O
so O
to O
create O
such O
a O
delirium O
of O
excitement O
, O
|
      | O
that O
Edward B-PERSON
was O
wholly O
unconscious O
of O
his O
own O
actions O
  O
and O
once O
or O
twice O
he O
led O
him O
into O

      | O
scenes O
, O
and O
made O
him O
sharer O
of O
such O
vicious O
pleasures O
, O
that O
secured O
him O
as O
his O
slave O
  O
for O
when O
|
      | O
the O
excitement O
was O
over O
, O
the O
agony O
of O
remorse O
, O

misery O
, O
lest O
his O
confiding O
captain O
should O

      | O
suspect O
him O
other O
than O

seemed O

him O
cling O
to O
Harding B-PERSON

promises O
of O
secrecy O
, O
as O
his O
only O

      | O
refuge O
, O
even O
while O
he O
loathed O
the O
man O
himself O

It O
was O
easy O
to O
make O
such O
a O
disposition O
believe O

      | O
that O
he O
had O
, O
in O
some O
moment O
of O
excitement O
, O
done O
something O

, O

would O
expel O

      | O
Navy B-ORG

Edward B-PERSON
could O
never O
recall O
what O
, O
but O
he O
believed O
him O
, O
and O
became O
desperate O
. O
Harding B-PERSON
told O
|
      | O
him O
it O
was O
downright O
folly O
to O
think O
about O
it O
so O
seriously O
. O
It O
was O
only O
known O
to O
him O

and O
he O

      | O
would O
not O
betray O
him O
. O
But O
Edward B-PERSON
writhed O
beneath O
his O
power O
  O
perpetually O
he O
called O
on O
him O
for O
|
      | O
pecuniary O
help O
, O
and O
when O
he O
had O
none O
, O
told O
him O
he O
must O
write O
home O
for O
it O
, O
or O
win O
it O
at O
the O

      | O
billiard O

, O
or O
he O
knew O
the O
consequences O
  O
and O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
though O
again O

again O
he O
had O

      | O
resolved O
he O
would O
not O
touch O

the O

, O
rather O
than O
write O
home O

      | O
would O
madly O
seek O
the O
first B-ORDINAL

win O
perhaps O

a O

satisfy O

the O

      | O
very O
day O

neared O

told O

chance O
at O

it O
  O

if O

fail O
before O
that O
— O
if O
she O

      | O
so O
exhausted O
it O
— O
carried O
more O
weight O
than O
all O
the O
rest O
  O

had O
the O
inexpressible O

      | O
relief O

      | O
so O

knew O
her O
so O
well O
that O

      | O
every O
suppression O

more O

Edward B-PERSON

" O
| 
  | O
To O
resist O
his O
look O
of O
pleading O
wretchedness O
was O
impossible O
. O
She O
left O
him O
, O

Edward B-PERSON
drawing O

      | O
a O
low O
stool O
to O
the O
foot O
of O
the O
couch O
, O
as O
if O
not O
daring O

occupy O
his O
cousin O

seat O
, O
which O
was O

      | O
close O
by O
the O

mild O

his O
aunt O

as O
in O
their O
deep O
repose O

they O
showed O
still O
clearer O
the O
traces O
of O
anxiety O
and O
sorrow O
, O
and O
felt O
more O
keenly O
than O
ever O
the O

      | O
full O
amount O
of O
misery O
, O
which O
his O
errors O

their O
fatal O
concealment O

created O
. O
" O
Why O
is O
it O
, O
" O

      | O
he O
thought O
, O

man O
can O
not O

the O
punishment O

faults O

also O

his O
heart O
seemed O
to O
answer O

by O
those O
very O
social O
ties O

would O

may O

preserved O

redeemed O

again O

again O

were O
man O
alone O
the O
sufferer O

Mrs. O

woke O
with O
that O
painful O
start O

long O
watchfulness O
always O
occasions O
, O
and O

      | O
missing O
Caroline B-GPE

yet O
feeling O
as O
if O
she O
were O
not O
alone O
, O
her O
eyes O
speedily O
fixed O
themselves O
in O

      | O
some O
surprise O
on O
the O
figure O
of O
her O
nephew O

, O
unable O
to O
bear O
the O
thoughts O
the O
sight O

her O

      | O
exhaustion O
produced O

bent O
his O
head O
upon O
the O
couch O

Inexpressibly O
touched O

glad O
of O
the O

      | O
opportunity O
to O
speak O
to O
him O
alone O
, O
she O
called O
him O
to O
her O
, O
and O
there O
was O
something O
in O
the O
tone O
|
      | O
that O
encouraged O
him O
to O
fling O
himself O
on O
his O
knees O
by O
her O
side O
, O
and O
sob O
like O
an O
infant O
, O
saying O
, O

      | O
almost O
inarticulately O
— O

changed O

inclosure O

only O
amends O

could O
make O
his O
poor O

it O
any O
wonder O

It O
was O
the B-DATE

of O
Ellen B-PERSON

illness O
, O
and O
for O
six B-DATE

thirty I-DATE
hours I-DATE
she O
had O
slept O
|
      | O
profoundly O
, O
waking O
only O
at O
very O
long O
intervals O
, O
just O
sufficiently O
to O
swallow O
a O
few O
drops O
of O
|
      | O
port O
wine O
, O
which O
Mr. O
Maitland B-PERSON
had O
ordered O
to O
be O
administered O
if O
she O
woke O
, O
and O
sunk O
to O
sleep O
|
      | O
again O
. O
It O
was O
that O
deep O
, O
still O
, O
almost O
fearful O
repose O
, O
for O
it O
is O
so O
like O
death O
, O
which O
we O
can O
|
      | O
scarcely O
satisfy O
ourselves O
is O
life O
, O
except O
by O
holding O
a O
glass O
at O
intervals O
to O
the O
lips O
, O
to O
|
      | O
trace O
if O
indeed O
it O
receive O
the O
moisture O
of O
the O
breath O

And O
nurse O
Langford B-PERSON
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
and O
|
      | O
Edward B-PERSON
had O
, O
through O
these B-TIME
long I-TIME
hours I-TIME
, O
watched O
and O
scarcely O
stirred O
. O
For O
they O
knew O
that O
on O
her O
|
      | O
waking O
hung O
hope O
or O
misery O
, O
return O
of O
intellect O
, O
or O
its O
confirmed O
suspension O
. O
Mr. O
Maitland B-PERSON
had O
|
      | O
particularly O
wished O
Edward B-PERSON
to O
be O
with O
her O
when O
she O
recovered O
her O
senses O
, O
that O
his O
presence O
|
      | O
might O
seem O
as O
natural O
as O
either O
of O
her O
cousins O
  O
but O
he O
warned O
him O
that O
the O
least O
display O
of O
|
      | O
agitation O
on O
his O
part O
, O
or O
reference O
to O
the O
past O
, O
in O
her O
exhausted O
state O
, O
might O
be O
fatal O
to O
|
      | O
her O
. O
It O
was O
quite O
the O
evening O
. O
Widow B-PERSON
Langford I-PERSON
had O
lighted O
the O
lamp O
, O
and O
sat O
down O
by O
the O
fire O
, O
|
      | O
scarcely O
able O
to O
breathe O
freely O
, O
from O
the O
intensity O
of O
her O
hope O
that O
Ellen B-PERSON
would O
recover O
. O
And O
|
      | O
if O
such O
were O
her O
feelings O
, O
what O
were O
Edward B-PERSON
's O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
's O
? O
The O
former O
was O
kneeling O
on O
|
      | O
the O
right O
of O
the O
bed O
, O
his O
eyes O
alternately O
fixed O
on O
his O
sister O
, O
and O
buried O
in O
the O
coverlid O
. O
|
      | O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
was O
on O
the O
opposite O
side O
, O
close O
to O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
pillow O
, O
the O
curtain O
drawn O
so O
far O
|
      | O
back O
, O
that O
the O
least O
change O
on O
the O
patient O
's O
countenance O
was O
discernible O
. O
Hour B-TIME
after I-TIME
hour I-TIME
had O
|
      | O
so O
passed O
, O
the O
chimes O
that O
told O
their O
flight O
were O
scarcely O
heard O
by O
those O
anxious O
watchers O
. O
It O
|
      | O
was O
about B-TIME
eight I-TIME
o'clock I-TIME
, O
when O
a O
slight O
movement O
in O
Ellen B-PERSON
made O
her O
aunt O
's O
heart O
so O
throb O
, O
as O
|
      | O
almost O
to O
deprive O
her O
of O
breath O
  O
her O
eyes O
unclosed O
, O
and O
a O
smile O
, O
such O
as O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
had O
not O
|
      | O
seen O
for O
weeks B-DATE
, O
nay O
, O
months B-DATE
, O
circled O
her O
lips O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Dear O
aunt O
, O
have O
I O
been O
ill O
? O
It O
seems O
such O
a O
long O
, O
long O
time O
since O
I O
have O
seen O
you O
, O
and O
my O
|
      | O
head O
feels O
so O
strange O
, O
so O
light O
  O
and O
this O
room O
, O
it O
is O
my O
own O
, O
I O
know O
, O
but O
I O
feel O
as O
if O
it O
did O
|
      | O
not O
belong O
to O
me O
, O
somehow O
. O
Do O
make O
my O
head O
clear O
, O
I O
can O
not O
think O
at O
all O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Do O
not O
try O
to O
think O
yet O
, O
darling O
. O
You O
have O
been O
very O
, O
very O
ill O
, O
and O
to O
endeavor O
to O
think O
|
      | O
might O
hurt O
you O
. O
Strength O
will O
soon O
return O
now O
, O
I O
hope O
, O
and O
then O
your O
head O
will O
be O
quite O
clear O
|
      | O
again O
, O
" O
returned O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
quietly O
and O
caressingly O
, O
though O
she O
so O
trembled O
with O
the O
|
      | O
change O
from O
sickening O
dread O
to O
certain O
hope O
, O
that O
she O
herself O
scarcely O
knew O
how O
she O
spoke O
at O
|
      | O
all O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
But O
what O
made O
me O
so O
ill O
, O
aunt O
? O
I O
feel O
as O
if O
it O
were O
some O
great O
pain O
  O
I O
can O
not O
remember O
any O
|
      | O
thing O
clearly O
, O
but O
yet O
it O
seems O
as O
if O
I O
had O
been O
very O
unhappy O
— O
and O
that O
— O
that O
you O
did O
not O
love O
|
      | O
me O
any O
more O
. O
Did O
any O
thing O
make O
me O
ill O
? O
Was O
it O
really O
so O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
That O
I O
did O
not O
love O
you O
, O
my O
Ellen B-PRODUCT
! O
Indeed O
, O
that O
was O
only O
fancy O
. O
You O
were O
very O
unhappy O
, O
as O
|
      | O
we O
were O
all O
, O
for O
Edward B-PERSON
did O
not O
come O
as O
soon O
as O
we O
expected O
him O
, O
and O
the O
storms O
were O
very O
|
      | O
dreadful O
, O
and O
we O
feared O
his O
ship O
might O
have O
been O
wrecked O
, O
or O
cast O
ashore O
, O
somewhere O
very O
far O
|
      | O
off O
, O
where O
we O
could O
not O
hear O
of O
him O
  O
and O
when O
you O
saw O
him O
, O
and O
knew O
he O
was O
safe O
, O
the O
anxiety O
|
      | O
and O
pain O
you O
had O
undergone O
, O
made O
you O
ill O
  O
you O
know O
a O
little O
thing O
will O
do O
that O
, O
dearest O
. O
" O

  | O
" O
But O
is O
he O
really O
safe O
, O
aunt O
Emmeline B-PERSON
? O
Where O
is O
he O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Close O
by O
you O
, O
love O
. O
He O
has O
been O
as O
watchful O
and O
anxious O
a O
nurse O
as O
I O
have O
been O
. O
Poor O
|
      | O
fellow O
, O
you O
have O
given O
him O
a O
sad O
welcome O
, O
but O
you O
must O
make O
up O
for O
it O
, O
by O
- O
and O
- O
by O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Ellen B-PERSON
looked O
languidly O
, O
yet O
eagerly O
round O
, O
as O
her O
aunt O
spoke O
, O
and O
her O
gaze O
fixed O
itself O
on O
|
      | O
her O
brother O
, O
who O
was O
struggling O
violently O
to O
suppress O
the O
emotion O
which O
, O
at O
the O
sound O
of O
her O
|
      | O
voice O
, O
in O
connected O
words O
, O
nearly O
overpowered O
him O
  O
and O
still O
more O
so O
, O
when O
Ellen B-PERSON
said O
, O
more O
|
      | O
eagerly O
than O
she O
had O
yet O
spoken O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
Dear O
Edward O
! O
come O
and O
kiss O
me O
, O
and O
do O
not O
look O
so O
sad O
. O
I O
shall O
soon O
get O
well O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
He O
bent O
over O
her O
, O
and O
kissed O
her O
repeatedly O
, O
trying O
in O
vain O
to O
say O
something O
, O
but O
he O
felt O
so O
|
      | O
choked O
, O
he O
could O
not O
  O
and O
Ellen B-PERSON
held O
his O
hand O
, O
and O
looked O
earnestly O
, O
searchingly O
in O
his O
face O
, O
|
      | O
as O
if O
trying O
painfully O
to O
define O
the O
vague O
thoughts O
and O
memories O
which O
seemed O
all O
connected O
|
      | O
with O
him O
and O
with O
pain O
, O
but O
which O
would O
not O
take O
a O
distinct O
form O
. O
Her O
eye O
wandered O
from O
him O
|
      | O
for O
a O
moment O
to O
nurse O
Langford B-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
come O
to O
the O
foot O
of O
the O
bed O
, O
and O
that O
seemed O
another O
|
      | O
face O
connected O
with O
the O
blank O
past O
, O
and O
then O
it O
fixed O
itself O
again O
on O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
and O
her O
pale O
|
      | O
face O
so O
worked O
with O
the O
effort O
of O
thought O
, O
that O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
became O
alarmed O
. O
She O
saw O
, O
too O
, O
|
      | O
that O
Edward B-PERSON
was O
growing O
paler O
and O
paler O
, O
and O
trembled O
for O
the O
continuance O
of O
his O
control O
. O
|
      | O
Taking B-PERSON
Ellen I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
hand O
gently O
from O
his O
, O
and O
arranging O
her O
pillow O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
so O
as O
to O
turn O
|
      | O
her O
face O
rather O
from O
him O
, O
she O
said O
, O
playfully O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
You O
have O
looked O
at O
Edward B-PERSON
long O
enough O
, O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
to O
be O
quite O
sure O
he O
is O
safe O
at O
home O
. O
So O
now O
I O
|
      | O
shall O
be O
jealous O
if O
you O
give O
him O
any O
more O
of O
your O
attention O
and O
neglect O
me O
  O
you O
must O
take O
some O
|
      | O
nourishment O
, O
and O
try O
to O
go O
to O
sleep O
again O
, O
for O
I O
must O
not O
have O
you O
try O
your O
strength O
too O
|
      | O
much O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
If O
I O
could O
but O
remember O
clearly O
, O
" O
answered O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
sadly O
  O
" O
it O
is O
all O
so O
vague O
— O
so O
dark O
— O
but O
I O
|
      | O
do O
not O
think O
it O
was O
only O
because O
he O
did O
not O
come O
, O
that O
made O
me O
so O
unhappy O
. O
" O

  | O
" O
You O
are O
not O
going O
to O
be O
disobedient O
, O
dearest O

replied O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
firmly O
, O
though O
|
      | O
fondly O
, O
as O
she O
hastily O
signed O
to O
Edward B-PERSON
to O
leave O
the O
room O
, O
which O
he O
most O
thankfully O
did O
, O
never O
|
      | O
stopping O
till O
he O
reached O
his O
own O
, O
and O
tried O
to O
thank O
God O
for O
His O
great O
mercy O
, O
but O
could O
only O
|
      | O
sob O
. O
" O
I O
told O
you O
not O
to O
think O
, O
because O
to O
do O
so O
might O
retard O
return O
of O
strength O
, O
and O
indeed O

      | O
you O
must O
try O
and O
obey O
me O
  O
you O
know O
I O
am O
very O
peremptory O
sometimes O

" O
And O
the O
fond O
kiss O
with O
|
      | O
which O
she O
enforced O
the O
command O
seemed O
to O
satisfy O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
whose O
natural O
submissiveness O
, O
combined O
|
      | O
with O
excessive O
physical O
weakness O
, O
caused O
her O
to O
obey O
at O
once O
, O
and O
not O
attempt O
to O
think O
any O
|
      | O
more O

She O
took O
the O
required O
nourishment O
with O
returning O
appetite O
, O
and O
soon O
afterward O
fell O

      | O
quietly O
and O
happily O
to O
sleep O
again O
, O
her O
aunt O

From O
that B-DATE

all O

the O

when O
, O
six B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
after O
her O
first B-ORDINAL
seizure O
, O
she O
was O
thought O
well O
enough O
to O
be O
carried O
|
      | O
to O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
's O
dressing O
- O
room O
, O
and O
laid O
on O
a O
couch O

it O
was O
a O
source O
of O
gratitude O

      | O
rejoicing O
to O
all O

But O
Mr. O
Maitland B-PERSON
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
soon O
saw O
, O
with O
intense O
anxiety O
, O
that O
with O

      | O
physical O
strength O
, O
memory O
and O
thought O
had O
both O
fully O
returned O
, O
and O
that O
their O
consequence O
was O
|
      | O
a O
depression O
so O
deep O
, O
as O
effectually O
to O
retard O
her O
perfect O
recovery O
. O
She O
seemed O
to O
shrink O
from O
|
      | O
all O
attention O
, O
all O
kindness O
, O
as O
utterly O
undeserved O
, O
even O
from O
her O
cousins O
. O
She O
would O
look O
at O
|
      | O
Edward B-PERSON
for O
half B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour I-TIME
together O
, O
with O
an O
expression O
of O
suffering O
that O
made O
the O
heart O
actually O
|
      | O
ache O
. O
At O
times O
she O
would O
receive O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
's O
caressing O
and O
judicious O
tenderness O
as O
if O
it O

      | O
were O
her O
only O
comfort O
, O
at O
others O
, O
shrink O
from O
it O
, O
as O
if O
she O
had O
no O
right O

it O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
This O
will O
never O
do O
, O
" O
Mr. O
Maitland B-PERSON
said O
, O
about B-DATE
ten I-DATE
days I-DATE
after O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
removal O
into O
her O
daily B-DATE
|
      | O
quarters O
, O
and O
finding O
she O
was O
losing O
ground O
  O
" O
there O
is O
something O
on O
her O
mind O
, O
which O
must O
be O
|
      | O
removed O
, O
even O
if O
to O
do O
so O
, O
you O
refer O
to O
the O
past O
. O
She O
remembers O
it O
all O
too O
clearly O
, O
I O
fear O
, O
so O
|
      | O
our O
not O
alluding O
to O
it O
does O
no O
good O

You O
must O
be O
the O
physician O
in O
this O
case O
, O
my O
dear O
Mrs. O

      | O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
for O
I O
am O
powerless O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
But O
though O
she O
quite O
agreed O
with O
him O
, O
how O
to O
approach O
such O
a O
very O
painful O
subject O
required O
|
      | O
no O
little O
consideration O
  O
but O
, O
as O
is O
very O
often O
the O
case O
, O
chance O
does O
that O
on O
which O
we O
have O

      | O
expended O
so O
much O
thought O

| 
  | O
One O
afternoon O
Ellen B-PERSON
lay O
so O
still O
, O
so O
pale O
, O
on O
her O
couch O
, O
that O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
bent O
over O
her O
to O
|
      | O
listen O
if O
she O
breathed O
, O
saying O
as O
she O
did O
so O
, O
almost O
unconsciously O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
My O
poor O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
when O
shall O
I O
have O
the O
comfort O
of O
seeing O
you O
well O
and O
happy O
again O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
Ellen B-PERSON
hastily O
unclosed O
her O
eyes O
, O
for O
she O
was O
not O
asleep O
— O
it O
had O
been O
only O
the O
stupor O
of O
|
      | O
painfully O
- O
engrossing O
thought O
, O
rendering O
her O
insensible O
to O
all O
outward O
things O
, O
but O
her O
aunt O
's O
|
      | O
voice O
aroused O
her O
, O
and O
it O
seemed O
an O
inexpressible O
relief O
to O
feel O

were O
quite O
alone O
. O
Trying O
|
      | O
to O
rise O
, O
and O
clasping O
her O
hands O
, O
she O
said O
, O
in O
a O
tone O
of O
strong O
excitement O
— O

  | O
" O

the O
misery O

brought O
on O

no O

I O
have O
only O
betrayed O

made O
him O
wretched O

the O
painful O

heavily O

fondly O

desperate O

an O
emotion O
that O
seemed O
more O
like O
pain O
than O
joy O
. O
She O
laid O
her O
head O
on O
her O
aunt O
's O
|
      | O
shoulder O
, O
and O
wept O
without O
restraint O
. O
They O
were O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
tears O
she O
had O
shed O
since O
her O
|
      | O
illness O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
thanked O
God O
for O
them O
. O
She O
did O
not O
attempt O
to O
check O
them O
, O
but O
the O
|
      | O
few O
words O
she O
did O
speak O
, O
told O
such O
affectionate O
sympathy O
, O
such O
perfect O
comprehension O
of O
that O
|
      | O
young O
heart O
, O
that O
Ellen B-PERSON
felt O
as O
if O
a O
mountain O
of O
lead O
were O
dissolving O
from O
her O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
And O
now O
, O
my O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
that O
I O
have O
relieved O
you O
of O
a O
painful O
dread O
, O
will O
you O
ease O
my O
mind O
of O
a O
|
      | O
great O
anxiety O
? O
" O
inquired O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
nearly B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour I-TIME
afterward O
, O
when O
Ellen B-PERSON
seemed O
so O
|
      | O
relieved O
and O
calmed O
, O
that O
she O
could O
talk O
to O
her O
without O
fear O
. O
" O
You O
look O
surprised O
  O
but O
it O
is O
a O
|
      | O
subject O
you O
alone O
can O
explain O
, O
and O
till O
it O
is O
solved O
, O
I O
shall O
never O
feel O
that O
your O
happiness O
|
      | O
is O
secure O
. O
What O
is O
this O
promise O
, O
to O
which O
in O
your O
illness O
you O
so O
constantly O
referred O
, O
and O
|
      | O
which O
, O
I O
fear O
, O
has O
strengthened O
you O
in O
the O
system O
of O
self O
- O
sacrifice O
for O
Edward B-PERSON
's O
sake O
, O
in O
|
      | O
addition O
to O
your O
love O
for O
him O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
A O
deep O
flush O
rose O
to O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
transparent O
cheek O
and O
brow O
, O
as O
she O
answered O
, O
falteringly O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
Ought O
I O
to O
tell O
you O
, O
dear O
aunt O
? O
You O
do O
not O
know O
how O
often O
, O
how O
very O
often O
I O
have O
longed O
to O
|
      | O
ask O
you O
, O
if O
to O
keep O
it O
made O
me O
do O
wrong O
— O
whether O
I O
ought O
to O
break O
it O
? O
And O
yet O
it O
seemed O
so O
|
      | O
sacred O
, O
and O
it O
gave O
poor O
mamma O
such O
comfort O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
When O
did O
you O
make O
it O
, O
love O
? O
Its O
import O
I O
need O
not O
ask O
you O
, O
for O
you O
betrayed O
it O
, O
when O
you O
|
      | O
knew O
not O
what O
you O
said O
, O
and O
it O
was O
confirmed O
by O
your O
whole O
conduct O
. O
To O
shield O
Edward B-PERSON
from O
|
      | O
blame O
or O
punishment O
, O
by O
never O
revealing O
his O
faults O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Was O
it O
wrong O
? O
" O
murmured O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
hiding O
her O
conscious O
face O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Wrong O
in O
you O
! O
no O
dearest O
  O
for O
you O
were O
too O
young O
to O
know O
all O
the O
pain O
and O
evil O
it O
was O
|
      | O
likely O
to O
bring O
. O
Tell O
me O
when O
, O
and O
how O
, O
it O
was O
taken O
  O
and O
I O
think O
I O
can O
prove O
to O
you O
that O
your O
|
      | O
poor O
mother O
would O
have O
recalled O
it O
, O
had O
she O
had O
the O
least O
idea O
of O
the O
solemn O
hold O
it O
had O
taken O
|
      | O
upon O
you O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Thus O
encouraged O
, O
Ellen B-PERSON
narrated O
the O
scene O
that O
had O
taken O
place O
in O
widow O
Morgan B-ORG
's O
cottage O
|
      | O
just O
before O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
arrived O
  O
and O
her O
mother O
's O
fears O
for O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
and O
dread O
of O
Mr. O
|
      | O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
which O
it O
was O
very O
evident O
, O
and O
now O
more O
than O
ever O
, O
had O
extended O
to O
both O
her O
|
      | O
children O
. O
She O
said O
that O
Mr. O
Myrvin B-PERSON
's O
assurance O
, O
that O
her O
mother O
could O
see O
, O
and O
would O
love O
her O
|
      | O
in O
Heaven O
, O
directly O
following O
the O
promise O
, O
had O
given O
it O
still O
more O
weight O
and O
solemnity O
. O
That O
|
      | O
at O
first O
she O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
very O
easy O
to O
keep O
, O
because O
she O
loved O
Edward B-PERSON
so O
dearly O
  O
but O
|
      | O
she O
had O
not O
been O
long O
at O
Oakwood B-ORG
before O
it O
made O
her O
very O
unhappy O
, O
from O
its O
constant O
|
      | O
interference O
with O
, O
and O
prevention O
of O
, O
her O
obedience O
and O
duty O
to O
her O
aunt O
  O
that O
it O
had O
often O
|
      | O
caused O
her O
violent O
head O
aches O
, O
only O
from O
her O
vain O
attempts O
to O
satisfy O
herself O
as O
to O
that O
which O
|
      | O
she O
ought O
to O
do O
. O
When O
Edward B-PERSON
first B-ORDINAL
went O
to O
sea O
, O
and O
all O
seemed O
so O
right O
and O
happy O
with O
him O
, O
of O
|
      | O
course O
she O
became O
happier O
than O
she O
had O
ever O
been O
before O
. O
Then O
came O
his O
difficulties O
, O
and O
her O
|
      | O
conviction O
that O
she O
must O
save O
him O
and O
keep O
his O
secret O
. O
That O
her O
reason O
and O
her O
affection O
often O
|
      | O
urged O
her O
to O
confide O
all O
to O
her O
aunt O
, O
certain O
that O
she O
would O
not O
harshly O
condemn O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
but O
|
      | O
would O
forgive O
and O
help O
him O
far O
more O
effectually O
than O
she O
could O
  O
but O
she O
dared O
not O
, O
for O
|
      | O
whenever O
she O
thought O
thus O
, O
the O
figure O
of O
her O
mother O
rose O
before O
her O
, O
seeming O
to O
reproach O
and O
|
      | O
threaten O
her O
for O
exposing O
the O
child O
she O
so O
dearly O
loved O
to O
disgrace O
and O
ruin O
  O
and O
this O
was O
so O
|
      | O
vivid O
— O
so O
constant O
during O
his O
last O
appeal O
, O
that O
she O
thought O
she O
must O
be O
going O
mad O
  O
that O
nothing O
|
      | O
but O
the O
dread O
of O
not O
being O
firm O
enough O
to O
keep O
Edward B-PERSON
's O
secret O
, O
had O
withheld O
her O
from O
|
      | O
confessing O
her O
sin O
at O
once O
to O
her O
aunt O
, O
especially O
when O
her O
uncle O
had O
so O
solemnly O
denounced O
it O
|
      | O
as O
theft O
, O
and O
that O
when O
it O
was O
discovered O
it O
seemed O
actual O
relief O
, O
though O
it O
brought O
such O
|
      | O
severe O
punishment O
, O
for O
she O
knew O
no O
suffering O
for O
her O
could O
be O
too O
severe O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
tale O
, O
as O
Ellen B-PERSON
told O
it O
, O
was O
brief O
and O
simple O
enough O
, O
and O
that O
there O
was O
any O
merit O
in O
|
      | O
such O
a O
system O
of O
self O
- O
devotion O
never O
seemed O
to O
enter O
her O
mind O
for O
a O
moment O
  O
but O
to O
Mrs. O
|
      | O
Hamilton B-PERSON
it O
revealed O
such O
an O
amount O
of O
suffering O
and O
trial O
, O
such O
a O
quiet O
, O
systematic O
, O
heroic O
|
      | O
endurance O
, O
that O
she O
unconsciously O
drew O
that O
young O
delicate O
being O
closer O
and O
closer O
to O
her O
, O
as O
|
      | O
if O
her O
love O
should O
protect O
her O
in O
future O
from O
any O
such O
trial O
  O
and O
from O
what O
had O
it O
all O
|
      | O
sprung?—the O
misery O
of O
years O
, O
at O
a O
period O
when O
life O
should O
be O
so O
joyous O
and O
so O
free O
, O
that O
care O
|
      | O
and O
sorrow O
flee O
it O
as O
purely O
and O
too O
briefly O
happy O
to O
approach O
? O
From O
a O
few O
thoughtless O
words O
, O
|
      | O
from O
a O
thoughtless O
, O
partial O
mother O
, O
whose O
neglect O
and O
dislike O
had O
pronounced O
that O
disposition O

      | O
cold O
, O
unloving O
and O
inanimate O
whose O
nature O
was O
so O
fervid O

so O
imaginative O

that O
the O
utmost O
care O

      | O
should O
have O
been O
taken O
to O
prevent O
the O
entrance O
of O
a O
single O
thought O
or O
feeling O
too O
precocious O
, O
|
      | O
too O
solemn O
for O
her B-DATE
years I-DATE

It O
may O
be O
urged O

and O
with O
truth O
, O
that O
to O
an O
ordinary O
child O
the O

      | O
promise O
might O
have O
been O
forgotten O

heedlessly O
laid O
aside O
, O
without O
any O
harm O
accruing O
from O

      | O
it O
, O
but O
it O
was O
from O
not O
caring O

the O
real O

the O
little O

I O
was O
so O
different O

      | O
was O
so O
handsome O

good O
, O

so O
animated O

happy O

I O
was O
always O
fretful O

ill O
, O
and O

      | O
they O
said O
so O
often O
naughty O
  O
and O
he O
used O
to O
fondle O
poor O
mamma O
, O
and O
show O
his O
love O
, O
which O
I O
was O

      | O
afraid O

do O

I O
did O
love O
her O

very O

much O

the O
tears O

      | O
I O
could O
not O
help O
feeling O
he O
must O
be O
much O
better O
than O
I O
was O
, O
just O
as O
I O
always O
feel O
all O
my O

it O
was O
no O

much O
the O
best O
. O

you O

THE O
LOSS O
OF O
THE O
SIREN O
. O
| 
  | O
From O
that B-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
recovery O
, O
though O
a O
sad O
trial O
of O
patience O
both O
to O
the O
young O
invalid O
|
      | O
and O
her O
affectionate O
nurses O
, O
was O
surely O
progressive O
, O
without O
any O
of O
those O
painful O
relapses O
|
      | O
which O
had O
so O
tried O
Mr. O
Maitland B-PERSON
's O
skill O
before O
. O
She O
no O
longer O
shrunk O
from O
the O
society O
of O
her O
|
      | O
relations O
, O
receiving O
Caroline B-ORG
's O
and O
Miss O
Harcourt B-PERSON
's O
many O
kind O
attentions O
with O
surprise O
indeed O
, O
|
      | O
for O
she O
could O
not O
imagine O
what O
could O
so O
have O
altered O
their O
feelings O
toward O
her O
, O
but O
with O
that O
|
      | O
evident O
gratitude O
and O
pleasure O
, O
which O
encourages O
a O
continuance O
of O
kindness O
. O
Emmeline O
was O
|
      | O
always O
kind O
, O
but O
it O
was O
indeed O
happiness O
to O
feel O
she O
might O
talk O
with O
and O
share O
her O
amusements O
, O
|
      | O
as O
in O
former O
days O
  O
and O
that O
, O
instead O
of O
thinking O
she O
ought O
not O
to O
receive O
her O
aunt O
's O
|
      | O
affection O
, O
the O
only O
thing O
she O
asked O
in O
return O
was O
her O
full O
confidence O
. O
The O
inexpressible O
rest O
|
      | O
to O
poor O
Ellen B-PERSON
which O
that O
conversation O
gave O
is O
not O
to O
be O
described O
. O
It O
was O
so O
blessed O
, O
so O
|
      | O
soothing O
, O
that O
it O
seemed O
too O
unnatural O
to O
last O
, O
and O
the O
secret O
dread O
that O
her O
uncle O
would O
not O
|
      | O
feel O
toward O
her O
and O
Edward B-PERSON
as O
her O
aunt O
did O
was O
its O
only O
alloy O
. O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
too O
, O
was O
cheerful O
, O
and O
|
      | O
almost O
happy O
when O
with O
her O
  O
and O
a O
long O
conversation O
with O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
, O
which O
that O
worthy O
man O
|
      | O
insisted O
upon O
having O
as O
soon O
as O
she O
was O
strong O
enough O
, O
to O
remove O
the O
false O
impressions O
which O
|
      | O
his O
severity O
had O
given O
, O
and O
which O
never O
ceased O
to O
grieve O
and O
reproach O
him O
, O
caused O
his O
almost O
|
      | O
daily B-DATE
visits O
to O
be O
anticipated O
by O
her O
with O
as O
much O
gladness O
as O
they O
had O
before O
brought O
|
      | O
dread O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
And O
now O
that O
anxiety O
for O
Ellen B-PERSON
is O
at O
end O
, O
I O
must O
have O
you O
take O
more O
care O
of O
yourself O
, O
Mrs. O
|
      | O
Hamilton B-PERSON
. O
Your O
husband O
's O
last O
injunctions O
, O
were O
, O
that O
I O
should O
never O
pass O
a B-DATE
week I-DATE
without O
|
      | O
calling O
once O
or O
twice O
at O
Oakwood B-ORG
to O
know O
how O
all O
was O
going O
on O
, O
and O
what O
would O
he O
say O
to O
me O
if O
|
      | O
he O
could O
see O
you O
now O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
He O
little O
thought O
how O
my O
strength O
would O
be O
tried O
, O
my O
good O
friend O
, O
and O
so O
will O
quite O
acquit O
|
      | O
you O
. O
I O
assure O
you O
that O
, O
physically O
, O
I O
am O
perfectly O
well"—(the O
worthy O
doctor O
shook O
his O
head O
|
      | O
most O
unbelievingly)—"but O
even O
with O
one O
great O
anxiety O
calmed O
, O
there O
remains O
another O
, O
which O
|
      | O
every B-DATE
week I-DATE
increases O
. O
It O
is O
more O
than O
double O
the O
usual O
time O
of O
hearing O
from O
my O
husband O
. O
We O
|
      | O
have O
never O
had O
any O
answer O
to O
the O
letters O
detailing O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
danger O
and O
Edward B-PERSON
's O
return O
, O
and O
the O
|
      | O
answers O
have O
been O
due O
a B-DATE
full I-DATE
month I-DATE
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
But O
the O
weather O
has O
been O
so O
unusually O
tempestuous O
, O
it O
may O
have O
been O
impossible O
for O
the O

Siren B-ORG

ply O
to O
and O
fro O
from O
Feroe B-GPE

Scotland B-GPE

Hamilton B-PERSON
wished O

and O
no O
ships O

likely O
to O
|
      | O
touch O
at O
those O
islands O
in O
the B-DATE
winter I-DATE

I O
really O
think O

returning O

" O

answered O
Mrs. O

turning O
very O
pale O
  O
" O
better O
the O
anxiety O

" O

Oakwood B-ORG
had O
resumed O
its O
regular O
happy O
aspect O
, O
though O
Ellen B-PERSON
was O
still O
up O
- O
stairs O
. O
Morris B-PERSON
and O
|
      | O
Ellis B-ORG
had O
once O
more O
the O
happiness O
of O
their O
beloved O
mistress O
's O
superintendence O
, O
and O
proud O
were O

both O

Caroline B-PERSON

to O
show O
all O

so O

      | O
unostentatiously O
, O
to O
save O
her O

she O
had O
been O
too O
anxious O

any O

      | O
thing O
but O
Ellen B-PERSON
  O
and O
the O
mother O

heart O
swelled O
with O
a O
delicious O
feeling O
of O
gratitude O
to O
Him O

      | O
who O
, O
if O
in O
making O
her O
so O
acutely O
sensible O
of O

deepened O

in O
the O

measure O
heightened O

spiritualized O

        | O
joy O

The O
fruit O
was O
indeed O
worth O

often O
washed O

      | O
children O

for O
the O
young O
men O
had O
evidently O
grown O
anxious O
on O
the O
subject O
too O
. O
It O
was O
not O

      | O
unlikely O
that O
the O
seas O
round O
Feroe B-PERSON

stormy O

should O
prevent O
any O
ship O
leaving O
the O
island O
, O
|
      | O
and O
the O
young O
people O
eagerly O
grasped O
the O
idea O
: O
so O
painful O
is O
it O
to O
youth O
to O
realize O
a O
cause O

      | O
for O
anxiety O
  O

even O
they O
, O
at O
times O
, O
grew O
unconsciously O
sad O
and O
meditating O
, O
as O
the O
usually O

      | O
joyous O
season O
of O
Christmas O
and O
New B-EVENT
Year I-EVENT
passed O

still O
there O
was O
no O
letter O

Ellen B-PERSON
and O
|
      | O
Edward B-PERSON
both O
in O
secret O
dreaded O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
answer O
to O
the O
latter O
's O
confession O
  O
but O
still O
|
      | O
their O
affection O
for O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
was O
too O
powerful O
to O
permit O
any O
thought O
of O
self O
interfering O
|
      | O
with O
the O
wish O
that O
her O
anxiety O

be O
calmed O
. O
| 
  | O
In O
January B-DATE
the O
weather O
changed O

the O
tremendous O
winds O
gave O
place O
to O
an O
almost O
unnatural O
calm O
, O

      | O
and O
to O
such O
excessive O
mildness O
and O
closeness O
of O
atmosphere O
, O
that O
it O
affected O
the O
health O
of O
|
      | O
many O
who O
were O
strong O
, O
and O
not O
only O
made O
Ellen B-PERSON
very O
languid O
, O
but O
frequently O
recalled O
those O
|
      | O
dreadful O
headaches O
which O
were O
in O
themselves O
an O
illness O

Dartmouth B-ORG
near O
the B-DATE
end I-DATE

he O
prevailed O
on O
Edward B-PERSON
to O
accompany O
him O
, O
for O
whenever O

      | O
his O
sister O
was O
more O
than O
usually O
suffering O
his O
gloom O
redoubled O

the O
sight O

      | O
Edward B-PERSON
did O
not O
deny O
it O
  O
for O
though O
it O
was O
good O
for O
the O
permanence O

his O
repentance O

resolution O

amend O

influence O

his O
home O

spirit O
inwardly O

      | O
chafed O
at O
his O
detention O

and O
yearned O
to O
be O
at O
sea O
again O

giving O
proof O
of O
his O
determination O

strangely O

      | O
closely O
, O
for O

as O
to O

almost O
portentous O

lingered O
on O

gladly O
turned O
more O
inland O
, O
while O
Edward B-PERSON
remained O
watching O
|
      | O
its O
progress O
with O
an O
almost O
pleasurable O
feeling O
of O
excitement O
, O
only O
wishing O
he O
could O
but O
be O
on O
|
      | O
the O
sea O
, O
to O
enjoy O
it O
as O
such O
a O
storm O
deserved O
to O
be O
. O
| 
  | O
As O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
drew O
to O
a O
close O
it O
increased O
, O
and O
as O
darkness O
set O
in O
, O
its O
fury O
became O
appalling O
. O
|
      | O
Blasts O
, O
long O
and O
loud O
as O
the O
reverberation O
of O
artillery O
, O
succeeded O
one O
another O
with O
awful O
|
      | O
rapidity O
, O
tearing O
up O
huge O
trees O
by O
the O
roots O
, O
and O
tiles O
from O
the O
roofs O
. O
Now O
and O
then O
, O
at O
|
      | O
distant O
intervals O
, O
blue O
lightning O
played O
through O
the O
black O
heavens O
, O
betraying O
that O
thunder O
had O
|
      | O
mingled O
with O
the O
wind O
, O
though O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
distinguish O
the O
one B-CARDINAL
sound O
from O
the O
other O
  O
|
      | O
and O
as O
the O
gusts O
passed O
onward O
, O
streaks O
of O
white O
and O
spots O
of O
strange O
unnatural O
blue O
gleamed O
|
      | O
through O
the O
gloom O
for O
a O
moment O
's O
space O
, O
leaving O
deeper O
darkness O
as O
they O
disappeared O
. O
The O
|
      | O
ocean O
, O
lashed O
to O
wildest O
fury O
, O
rolled O
in O
huge O
mountains O
of O
troubled O
waters O
, O
throwing O
up O
|
      | O
showers O
of O
snowy O
foam O
, O
contrasting O
strangely O
with O
the O
darkness O
of O
earth O
and O
heaven O
, O
and O
|
      | O
bursting O
with O
a O
sound O
that O
deadened O
for O
the O
time O
even O
the O
wild O
roar O
of O
the O
blast O
. O
To O
read O
or O

      | O
even O
to O
converse O
, O
in O
their O
comfortable O
quarters O
in O
the O
hotel O
, O
which O
overlooked O
the O
sea O
, O
became O
|
      | O
as O
impossible O
to O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
as O
to O
Edward B-PERSON
. O
About B-TIME
eleven I-TIME
o'clock I-TIME
, O
however O
, O
the O
wind O
suddenly O
|
      | O
veered O
and O
lulled O
, O
only O
sending O
forth O
now O
and O
then O
a O
long O
sobbing O
wail O
, O
as O
if O
regretful O
that O
|
      | O
its O
work O
of O
destruction O
was O
even O
checked O
  O
but O
the O
sea O
raged O
with O
equal O
fury O
, O
presenting O
a O
|
      | O
spectacle O
as O
magnificent O
, O
as O
awful O
, O
and O
giving O
no O
appearance O
of O
a O
calm O
. O
A O
sharp O
report O
sounded O
|
      | O
suddenly O
from O
the O
sea O
— O
whether O
it O
was O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
or O
that O
others O
might O
have O
been O
lost O
in O
the O
|
      | O
tumult O
of O
the O
winds O
and O
waves O
, O
who O
might O
answer O
? O
Another O
, O
and O
another O
, O
at O
such O
rapid O
|
      | O
intervals O
, O
that O
the O
danger O
was O
evidently O
imminent O
, O
and O
Edward B-PERSON
started O
to O
his O
feet O
. O
Again O
— O
and O
|
      | O
he O
could O
bear O
it O
no O
longer O
. O
Hurriedly O
exclaiming O
, O
" O
They O
are O
signals O
of O
distress O
and O
close O
at O

      | O

Something O
must O
be O
done O
  O
no O
sailor O
can O
sit O
still O
, O
and O
see O
sailors O
perish O
! O
" O
he O
rushed O
to O
|
      | O
the O
beach O
, O
closely O
followed O
by O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
resolved O
on O
preventing O
any O
mad O
attempt O
. O
|
      | O
Crowds O
of O
fishermen O
and O
townsmen O
had O
congregated O
on O
the O
beach O
, O
drawn O
by O
that O
fearful O
sound O
, O
|
      | O
which O
, O
by O
the O
light O
from O
the O
guns O
seemed O
scarcely O
half B-QUANTITY
a I-QUANTITY
mile I-QUANTITY
distant O
  O
and O
yet O
so O
perilous O
was O
|
      | O
the O
present O
appearance O
of O
the O
ocean O
, O
that O
to O
go O
to O
their O
assistance O
seemed O
impossible O
. O
|
      | O
Suddenly O
, O
however O
, O
Edward B-PERSON
's O
voice O
exclaimed O
, O
with O
the O
glad O
and O
eager O
tone O
of O
perfect O
|
      | O
confidence O
, O
" O
They O
can O
be O
saved!—a O
strong O
boat O
and O
two B-CARDINAL
willing O
rowers O

and O
I O
will O
undertake O
to O

      | O
reach O
the O

bring O
the O
crew O
safe O
to O
shore O

Who O
among O
you O
, O
" O
he O
continued O
turning O
|
      | O
eagerly O
to O
the O
group O
of O
hardy O
fishermen O
, O
" O

was O
the O
sullen O
answer O
from O
one O
of O
those O
he O
addressed O
, O
and O
|
      | O
the O
rest O
stood O
silent O
, O
eyeing O
, O
half B-CARDINAL
disdainfully O
half B-CARDINAL
admiringly O
, O
the O
slight O
figure O
of O
the O

      | O
young O
sailor O
, O
revealed O
as O
it O
was O
, O
in O
the O
fitful O
light O
of O
the O
many O
torches O
scattered O
by O
the O

      | O
various O
groups O
along O
the O
beach O

" O

passion O

the O

ten B-TIME

sunk O

swallowed O
up O

large O

The O
silence O

awe O

intense O
thankfulness O
, O
fell O
on O

every O

more O
than O

The O

intense O
eagerness O
the O

The O

unwonted O
gloom O

      | O
Convinced O

physical O

from O
the O
unusual O
oppressiveness O
of O
the O
weather O

      | O
relaxing O
the O
nerves O
, O
which O
had O
so O
many O
months O
been O

yet O
her O

idea O
of O

having O
left O
Feroe B-GPE
, O
and O
exposure O
to O
such O
a O
tempest O
, O
should O
become O
in O
that O
fearful O

      | O
anxiety O
almost O
a O
certainty O
of O
agony O
. O
It O
was O
well O
, O
perhaps O
, O
that O
her O
unselfish O
nature O
had O
an O

      | O
object O
to O
draw O
her O
in O
some O
slight O
degree O
out O
of O
herself O

for O
her O
firmness O
, O
her O
trust O
beyond O

      | O
the O
accidents O
of O
earth O
, O
all O
seemed O
about O
to O
fail O
her O
, O
and O
make O
her O
for O
the O
time O
being O
most O
|
      | O
wretched O
. O
As O
the O
storm O
and O
closeness O
increased O
, O
so O
did O
Ellen B-PERSON

feverish O
restlessness O
  O
her O

      | O
nerves O
, O
not O
yet O
fully O
restored O
, O
felt O
strung O
almost O
to O
torture O
with O
every O
flash O
, O
and O
clap O
, O
and O
|
      | O
blast O
. O
She O
tried O
to O
laugh O
at O
her O
own O
folly O
  O
for O
, O
though O
often O
terrified O
, O
when O
a O
little O
child O

      | O
at O
the O
storms O
in O
India B-GPE

those O
of O
England B-GPE

never O
affected O
her O
at O
all O

she O
could O
not O

      | O
understand O
why O
she O
should O
feel O
this O
so O
childishly O

But O
argument O

her O
physical O

tried O

her O

in O

not O
leave O
her O
till O
past B-TIME
midnight I-TIME
  O
and O
then O
desiring O
Mrs. O
Langford B-PERSON
to O
sit O
up O
|
      | O
with O
her O
till O
she O
was O
comfortably O
asleep O
, O
retired O
to O
her O
own O
bed O
- O
room O
. O
Never O
since O
her O
|
      | O
husband O
's O
absence O
had O
its O
solitude O
felt O
so O
vast O
— O
so O
heavily O
oppressive O
  O
thought O
after O
thought O
|
      | O
of O
him O
thronged O
her O
mind O
till O
she O
fairly O
gave O
up O
the O
effort O
to O
struggle O
with O
them O
. O
" O
Will O
his O
|
      | O
voice O
ever O
sound O
here O
again O
, O
his O
heart O
give O
me O
the O
support O
I O
need O
? O
" O
rose O
to O
her O
lips O
, O
as O
she O
|
      | O
gazed O
round O
her O
, O
and O
the O
deep O
stillness O
, O
the O
gloom O
only O
broken O
by O
a O
small O
silver O
lamp O
, O
and O
the O
|
      | O
fitful O
light O
of O
the O
fire O
, O
seemed O
but O
a O
solemn O
answer O
. O
She O
buried O
her O
face O
in O
her O
clasped O
|
      | O
hands O
, O
and O
the O
clock O
struck O
two B-CARDINAL
before O
that O
inward O
conflict O
permitted O
her O
once O
more O
to O
lift O
up O
|
      | O
heart O
and O
brow O
in O
meek B-GPE
, O
trusting O
faith O
to O
Him O
who O
still O
watched O
over O
her O
and O
her O
beloved O
ones O
  O
|
      | O
and O
after O
an O
earnest O
, O
voiceless O
prayer O
, O
she O
drew O
her O
little O
table O
, O
with O
its O
books O
of O
devotion O
, O
|
      | O
to O
the O
fire O
, O
and O
read O
thoughtfully O
, O
prayerfully O
, O
for O
another B-TIME
hour I-TIME
, O
and O
then O
sought O
her O
couch O
. O
|
      | O
But O
she O
could O
not O
sleep O
  O
the O
wind O
had O
again O
arisen O
, O
and O
fearing O
to O
lie O
awake O
and O
listen O
to O
it O
|
      | O
would O
only O
renew O
her O
unusual O
agitation O
, O
she O
rose O
at O
four B-CARDINAL
, O
dressed O
herself O
, O
and O
throwing O
on O
a O
|
      | O
large O
shawl O
, O
softly O
traversed O
the O
passage O
, O
and O
entered O
her O
niece O
's O
room O
  O
finding O
her O
, O
as O
she O
|
      | O
fully O
expected O
, O
as O
wakeful O
and O
restless O
as O
herself O
, O
with O
the O
addition O
of O
an O
intense O
headache O
. O
|
      | O
She O
had O
persuaded O
nurse O
Langford B-PERSON
to O
go O
to O
bed O
, O
but O
the O
pain O
had O
come O
on O
since O
then O
, O
and O
made O
|
      | O
her O
more O
restless O
and O
feverish O
than O
before O
. O
She O
could O
not O
lie O
in O
any O
posture O
to O
get O
ease O
, O
till O
|
      | O
at O
last O
, O
about B-TIME
six I-TIME
o'clock I-TIME
, O
completely O
exhausted O
, O
she O
fell O
asleep O
, O
sitting O
almost O
upright O
in O
|
      | O
her O
aunt O
's O
arms O
, O
her O
head O
leaning O
against O
her O
, O
as O
she O
stood O
by O
the O
bedside O
. O
Fearing O
to O
disturb O
|
      | O
her O
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
would O
not O
move O
, O
desiring O
the O
morning B-TIME
prayers O
to O
be O
said O
without O
her O
, O
and O
|
      | O
Miss O
Harcourt B-PERSON
and O
her O
daughters O
not O
to O
wait O
breakfast O
, O
as O
she O
would O
have O
it O
with O
Ellen B-PERSON
when O
|
      | O
she O
awoke O
. O
That O
she O
was O
stiff O
and O
exhausted O
with O
three B-TIME
hours I-TIME
' O
standing O
in O
one B-CARDINAL
position O
, O
she O
|
      | O
did O
not O
heed O
, O
perhaps O
scarcely O
felt O
, O
for O
woman O
's O
loveliest O
attribute O
, O
that O
of O
a O
tender O
and O
|
      | O
utterly O
unselfish O
nurse O
, O
was O
hers O
to O
perfection O
. O
But O
she O
did O
not O
refuse O
the O
cup O
of O
chocolate O
|
      | O
Caroline B-GPE
brought O
her O
herself O
, O
and O
with O
affectionate O
earnestness O
entreated O
her O
to O
take O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
You O
look O
so O
fatigued O
and O
so O
pale O
, O
dearest O
mother O
, O
I O
wish O
you O
would O
let O
me O
take O
your O
place O
  O
|
      | O
I O
would O
be O
so O
quiet O
, O
so O
gentle O
, O
Ellen B-PERSON
would O
not O
even O
know O
her O
change O
of O
nurses O

" O

  | O
" O
I O
do O
not O
doubt O
your O
care O
, O
love O
, O
but O
I O
fear O
the O
least O
movement O
will O
disturb O
this O
poor O
child O
, O
|
      | O
and O
she O
has O
had O
such O
a O
restless O
night O
, O
I O
want O
her O
to O
sleep O
as O
long O
as O
she O
can O
. O
Your O
thoughtful O
|
      | O
care O
has O
so O
refreshed O
me O
, O
that O
I O
feel O
quite O
strong O
again O
, O
so O
go O
and O
finish O
your O
breakfast O
in O

      | O
comfort O
, O
dearest O

" O
| 
  | O
Caroline B-GPE
very O
unwillingly O
obeyed O
, O
and O
about B-CARDINAL
a I-CARDINAL
quarter I-CARDINAL
of O
an O
hour O
afterward O
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
|
      | O
was O
startled O
by O
the O
sound O
of O
a O
carriage O
advancing O
with O
unusual O
velocity O
to O
the O
house O
. O
It O
|
      | O
stopped O
at O
the O
main O
entrance O
, O
and O
she O
had O
scarcely O
time O
to O
wonder O
who O
could O
be O
such O
very O
early O
|
      | O
visitors O
, O
when O
a O
loud O
scream O
, O
in O
the O
voice O
of O
Emmeline B-GPE
, O
rung O
in O
her O
ears O
  O
whether O
of O
joy O
or O
|
      | O
grief O
she O
could O
not O
distinguish O
, O
but O
it O
was O
the O
voice O
of O
her O
child O
, O
and O
the O
already O
tortured O
|
      | O
nerves O
of O
the O
wife O
and O
mother O
could O
not O
bear O
it O
without O
a O
sensation O
of O
terror O
, O
amounting O
to O
|
      | O
absolute O
agony O
. O
She O
laid O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
head O
tenderly O
on O
the O
pillow O
, O
watched O
over O
her O
, O
though O
her O
|
      | O
limbs O
so O
trembled O
she O
could O
scarcely O
support O
herself O
, O
saw O
with O
intense O
relief O
that O
the O
|
      | O
movement O
had O
not O
disturbed O
her O
quiet O
sleep O
, O
and O
calling O
Mrs. O
Langford B-PERSON
from O
an O
adjoining O
room O
, O
|
      | O
hastily O
descended O
the O
stairs O
, O
though O
how O
she O
did O
so O
, O
and O
entered O
the O
breakfast O
- O
room O
, O
she O
|
      | O
always O
said O
she O
never O
knew O
. O
Many O
and O
eager O
and O
glad O
voices O
were O
speaking O
at O
once O
  O
the O
very O
|
      | O
servants O
thronged O
the O
hall O
and O
threshold O
of O
the O
room O
, O
but O
all O
made O
way O
for O
her O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Arthur!—my O
husband O
! O
" O
she O
did O
find O
voice O
to O
exclaim O
, O
but O
every O
object O
but O
his O
figure O
reeled O
|
      | O
before O
her O
, O
and O
she O
fainted O
in O
his O
arms O
. O
| 
  | O
It O
was O
some O
time O
before O
she O
recovered O
, O
for O
mind O
and O
frame O
had O
been O
too O
long O
overtasked O
  O
and O
|
      | O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
as O
he O
clasped O
her O
in O
his O
arms O
, O
beseeching O
her O
only O
to O
speak O
to O
him O
, O
and O
gazed O
on O
|
      | O
her O
deathlike O
countenance O
, O
felt O
in O
a O
moment O
that O
great O
as O
his O
anxiety O
had O
been O
for O
her O
, O
he O
had O
|
      | O
not O
imagined O
one B-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
half I-CARDINAL
she O
had O
endured O
. O
His O
voice O
— O
his O
kiss O
— O
seemed O
to O
rouse O
the O
scattered O
|
      | O
senses O
, O
even O
more O
effectually O
than O
Miss O
Harcourt B-GPE
's O
anxiously O
proffered O
remedies O
  O
but O
she O
could O
|
      | O
not O
speak O
, O
she O
only O
looked O
up O
in O
his O
face O
, O
as O
if O
to O
be O
quite O
, O
quite O
sure O
he O
had O
indeed O
|
      | O
returned O
  O
that O
her O
vague O
fancies O
of O
danger O
, O
even O
if O
they O
had O
foundation O
, O
had O
merged O
in O
the O
|
      | O
most O
blissful O
reality O
, O
that O
she O
was O
no O
longer O
|  | O
alone O
| | O
  O
and O
leaning O
her O
head O
on O
his O
|
      | O
bosom O
, O
was O
only O
conscious O
of O
a O
thankfulness O
too O
deep O
for O
words O
  O
a O
repose O
that O
, O
since O
his O
|
      | O
departure O
, O
she O
had O
not O
known O
for O
a B-DATE
single I-DATE
day I-DATE
. O
Neither O
she O
nor O
her O
husband O
could O
believe O
that O
|
      | O
it O
was O
only B-DATE
six I-DATE
months I-DATE
since O
they O
had O
been O
separated O
. O
It O
seemed O
, O
and O
to O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
|
      | O
especially O
, O
as O
if O
she O
must O
have O
lived O
through O
years O
in O
that O
time O
, O
it O
had O
been O
so O
fraught O
with O
|
      | O
sorrow O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Not O
one O
word O
, O
my O
own O
dearest O
! O
and O
only O
these O
pallid O
cheeks O
and O
heavy O
eyes O
to O
greet O
me O
. O
Must O
|
      | O
I O
reproach O
you O
directly O
I O
come O
home O
, O
for O
, O
as O
usual O
, O
not O
thinking O
enough O
of O
yourself O
  O
|
      | O
forgetting O
how O
precious O
is O
that O
self O
to O
so O
many O
, O
your O
husband O
above O
all O

" O

" O
Nay O
, O
papa O
, O
you O
shall O
not O
scold O
mamma O

said O
Emmeline B-PERSON
, O
eagerly O
, O
as O
her O
mother O
tried O
to O
smile O
|
      | O
and O
speak O
in O
answer O
. O
" O
She O
ought O
to O
scold O
you O
, O
for O
not O
sending O
us O
one B-CARDINAL
line O
to O
prepare O
us O
for O
|
      | O
your O
unexpected O
presence O
, O
and O
frightening O
us O
all O
by O
coming O
so O
suddenly O
upon O
us O
, O
and O
making O
|
      | O
mamma O
faint O

as O
I O
never O

Indeed O
I O
do O
not O
like O
it O
, O
mother O
darling O
! O

continued O
|
      | O
the O
affectionate O
girl O
, O
kneeling O
down O
by O
her O
mother O
, O
and O
clinging O
to O
her O
, O
adding O
, O
in O
a O

      | O
suppressed O
, O
terrified O
voice O
, O
" O
It O
was O
so O
like O
death O

" O
| 
  | O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
read O
in O
a O
moment O
that O
Emmeline B-ORG
's O
playfulness O
was O
only O
assumed O
to O
hide O
strong O
|
      | O
emotion O
  O
that O
she O
was O
trying O
very O
hard O
for O
complete O
control O
, O
but O
so O
trembling O
, O
that O
she O
knelt O
|
      | O
down O
, O
literally O
because O
she O
could O
not O
stand O
. O
It O
was O
such O
a O
proof O
of O
her O
endeavor O
to O
profit O
by O
|
      | O
her O
mother O
's O
gentle O
lessons O
, O
that O
even O
at O
that O
moment O
it O
not O
only O
gave O
her O
the O
sweetest O
|
      | O
gratification O
, O
but O
helped O
her O
to O
rouse O
herself O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Indeed O
, O
I O
think O
you O
are O
perfectly O
right O
, O
Emmy B-PERSON
, O
" O
she O
said O
, O
quite O
in O
her O
usual O
voice O
, O
as O
she O
|
      | O
pressed O
her O
child O
a O
moment O
to O
her O
, O
and O
kissed O
her O
cheek O
, O
which O
was O
almost O
as O
pale O
as O
her O
own O
. O
|
      | O
" O
I O
will O
not O
submit O
to O
any O
scolding O

papa O
himself O
is O
answerable O
for O
my O
unusual O
weakness O
  O

      | O
but O
as O
we O
wanted O
him O
so O

very O

much O

we O

be O
lenient O

  O

dwelling O
only O

extraordinary O

the O

expressed O
opinions O

Harvey O

old O
Collins B-PERSON
as O
to O
the O
better O

the O
effects O

burst O

all O
leaped O

receding O

back O

Harvey B-PERSON

acknowledged O
their O
error O
at O

eagerly O
for O

safe O

Mr. O

annoyance O

for O

had O
not O
the O

suspicion O

was O
, O

only O
longed O
to O

      | O
express O

gratitude O

sinking O
vessel O

in O
such O

with O
the O

      | O
superstition O
of O
his O
class O

by O
a O
declaration O
, O
that O
his O
disappearance O
convinced O
his O
already O
more O
|
      | O
than O
suspicion O
, O
that O
it O
was O
some O
good O
angel O
in O
a O
boy O

      | O
never O
have O
been O
permitted O
so O
to O
perish O

an O
explanation O
, O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
added O
, O
laughingly O
, O
that O

      | O
might O
suit O
his O
Emmy B-PERSON
, O

was O
rather O
too O
fanciful O
for O
him O
. O
However O
, O
his O
young O
preserver O
was O

      | O
nowhere O
to O
be O
found O
, O

, O
to O
his O
extreme O
astonishment O
, O
and O
no O
little O
relief O
( O
for O
now O
that O
he O

      | O
was O
so O
near O
home O

his O
anxiety O
to O
hear O
of O
all O
, O
especially O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
whom O
he O
scarcely O
dared O
hope O

      | O
find O
alive O

became O
insupportable O
) O
, O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
suddenly O
stood O
before O
him O
, O
grasping O
both O
his O

      | O
hands O
, O
without O
the O
power O
, O
for O
a B-TIME
minute I-TIME
or O
two B-CARDINAL
, O
to O
speak O
. O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
overwhelmed O
him O
with O
|
      | O
questions O
, O
scarcely O
giving O
him O
time O
to O
answer O
one O
before O
he O
asked O
another O
. O
They O
had O
nearly O
|
      | O
reached O
the O
hotel O
, O
when O
Captain O
Harvey B-PERSON
's O
bluff O
voice O
was O
heard O
exclaiming O
— O

" O
Here O

exhausted O

      | O
could O
the O
youngster O
have O
tried O

hide O
himself O
for O
? O

But O
before O
Mr. O

could O
make O
any O
rejoinder O
, O
save O
to O
grasp O
the O
young O
man O

hands O

      | O
strongly O
in O
his O
own O
, O

eagerly O

off O
his O
dripping O
jacket O

give O
him O
some O
of O
your O
sailor O

stuff O

He O
is O
not O

      | O
quite O
strong O
enough O
for O
his O
exertions O
to O
- O
night O
, O

should O
rest O
at O
once O
. O
" O

  | O
Captain B-PERSON
Harvey I-PERSON
bore O
him O
off O
, O
almost O
carrying O
him O
, O
for O
exertion O
and O
a O
variety O
of O
emotions O
had O
|
      | O
rendered O
him O
faint O
and O
powerless O
. O

" O
Do O
you O
know O
him O
, O
Howard B-PERSON
? O
who O
and O
what O
is O
he O
? O
" O
But O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
did O
not O
, O
perhaps O
could O
not O

      | O
reply O
, O
but O
hurried O
his O
friend O
on O
to O
the O
hotel O
  O
and O
entered O
the O
room O
, O
where O
, O
having O
called O
for O

      | O
lights O
, O

all O
the O
ingredients O
of O
grog O

he O
vowed O
the O
boy O
should O
have O
instead O
of O

      | O
the O
brandy O
and O
water O
he O
had O
called O
for O

they O
found O
Edward B-PERSON
trying O
to O
laugh O
, O
and O
protesting O

      | O
against O
all O
coddling O
  O
he O
was O
perfectly O
well O
, O
and O
he O
would O
not O
go O
to O
bed O
, O
and O
could O
not O
imagine O
|
      | O
what O
right O
Captain B-PERSON
Harvey I-PERSON
had O
to O
be O
a O
sailor O
, O
if O
he O
thought O
so O
much O
of O
a O
storm O
, O
and O
a O
blow O
, O

      | O
and O
a O
wetting O

" O
Nor O
should O
I O
, O
if O
you O
were O
sailor O

rigged O
  O

what O
business O
have O
you O
with O
this O
overgrown O

mast O
of O
a O
figure O

And O
so O
like O
his O
dying O
mother O
it O
was O
, O
that O
Mr. O

stood O
for O
a O
moment O
on O
the O

stupefied O

leave O
our O

how O
Captain B-PERSON

carried O

      | O
the O
seemingly O
marvelous O
news O
that O

a O
miraculously O
short O
space O
of O

We O
may O
as O
well O
state O
here O
at O
once O

to O
save O
farther O
retrospection O
, O
that O
Mr. O

, O
by O
the O
|
      | O
active O
and O
admirable O
assistance O
of O
Morton B-GPE

had O
, O
after O
a O
three B-DATE
months I-DATE
' I-DATE
residence O
at O
Feroe B-ORG
, O
|
      | O
perceived O
that O
he O
might O
return O
to O
England B-GPE
much O
sooner O
than O
he O
had O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
anticipated O
  O
still O

      | O
he O
did O
not O
like O
to O
mention O
even O
the O
probability O
of O
such O
a O
thing O
to O
his O
family O
, O
till O
perfectly O
|
      | O
certain O
himself O
. O
Morton B-PERSON
never O
ceased O
persuading O
him O
to O
name O
a O
period O
for O
his O
return O
, O
knowing O
|
      | O
the O
comfort O
it O
would O
be O
to O
his O
home O
  O
but O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
could O
not O
bear O
the O
idea O
of O
leaving O
his O
|
      | O
friend O
in O
his O
voluntary O
banishment O
so O
many O
months O
sooner O
than O
they O
had O
reckoned O
on O
. O
When O
, O
|
      | O
however O
, O
the O
letters O
came O
from O
Oakwood B-ORG
, O
detailing O
Edward B-PERSON
's O
return O
, O
and O
the O
discoveries O
thence O

      | O
proceeding O
, O
his O
anxiety O
and O
, O
let O
it O
be O
owned O
, O
his O
extreme O
displeasure O
against O
his O
nephew O
, O
|
      | O
prompted O
his O
return O
at O
once O
. O
Morton B-PERSON
not O
only O
conquered O
every O
objection O
to O
his O
immediate O
|
      | O
departure O
, O
but O
tried O
, O
and O
in O
some O
measure O
succeeded O
, O
to O
soften O
his O
anger O
, O
by O
bringing O
before O
|
      | O
him O
many O
points O
in O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
's O
letter O
, O
showing O
real O
, O
good O
, O
and O
true O
repentance O
in O
the O
|
      | O
offender O
, O
which O
a O
first B-ORDINAL
perusal O
of O
a O
narrative O
of O
error O
had O
naturally O
overlooked O
. O
The O
seas O
, O
|
      | O
however O
, O
were O
so O
fearfully O
tempestuous O
and O
the O
winds O
so O
adverse O
, O
that O
it O
was O
impossible O
either O

      | O
to O
leave O
Feroe B-PERSON
, O
or O
get O
a O
letter O
conveyed O
to O
Scotland B-GPE
, O
for O
a O
full O
fortnight O
after O
the O
Siren B-ORG
's O
|
      | O
last O
voyage O
. O
Nothing O
but O
the O
extreme O
urgency O
of O
the O
case O
, O
increased O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
|
      | O
detention O
of O
the O
Siren O
at O
Wick O
had O
given O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
a O
double O
packet O
of O
letters O
, O
but O
the O
|
      | O
second B-ORDINAL
, O
though O
dated O
ten B-DATE
days I-DATE
later I-DATE
, O
gave O
the O
same O
hopeless O
account O
of O
Ellen B-GPE
, O
could O
have O
made O
|
      | O
him O
attempt O
a O
voyage O
home O
in O
such O
weather O
  O
yet O
he O
felt O
he O
could O
not O
rest O
, O
knowing O
intuitively O
|
      | O
the O
misery O
his O
wife O
must O
be O
enduring O
, O
and O
scarcely O
able O
to O
bear O
even O
the O
thought O
of O
what O
|
      | O
seemed O
most O
probable O
, O
that O
Ellen B-PERSON
would O
be O
taken O
from O
her O
, O
and O
the O
aggravated O
trial O
it O
would O
|
      | O
be O
. O
The O
voyage O
was O
a O
terrible O
one O
, O
for O
length O
and O
heavy O
gales O
. O
More O
than O
once O
they O
wished O
to O
|
      | O
put O
into O
port O
, O
that O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
might O
continue O
his O
journey O
by O
land O
, O
but O
their O
only O
safety O
|
      | O
seemed O
keeping O
out O
at O
sea O
, O
the O
storm O
threatening O
to O
dash O
them O
on O
rock O
or O
shoal O
, O
whenever O
in O
|
      | O
sight O
of O
land O
. O
| 
  | O
By O
the O
time O
they O
reached O
the O
Land O
's O
End O
— O
they O
had O
come O
westward O
of O
England B-GPE
, O
instead O
of O
|
      | O
eastward O
, O
as O
they O
went O
— O
the O
vessel O
was O
in O
such O
a O
shattered O
and O
leaky O
condition O
, O
that O
Captain O
|
      | O
Harvey O
felt O
and O
acknowledged O
, O
she O
could O
not O
weather O
out O
another O
storm O
. O
The O
calm O
that O
had O
|
      | O
followed O
the O
heavy O
gales O
, O
gave O
hope O
to O
all O
  O
even O
though O
the O
constant O
shiftings O
of O
the O
wind O
, O
|
      | O
which O
was O
now O
not O
more O
than O
what O
, O
in O
sailor O
's O
parlance O
, O
is O
called O
a O
cat's O
- O
paw O
, O
prevented O
their O
|
      | O
making O
as O
much O
way O
as O
they O
desired O
. O
At O
length O
they O
were O
within O
twenty B-QUANTITY
miles I-QUANTITY
of O
Dartmouth B-ORG
, O
and O
|
      | O
not O
a O
doubt O
of O
their O
safety O
disturbed O
them O
, O
until O
the O
darkening O
atmosphere O
, O
the O
sullen O
rise O
|
      | O
and O
suppressed O
roar O
of O
the O
billows O
, O
the O
wind O
sobbing O
and O
wailing O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
and O
then O
bursting O
|
      | O
into O
that O
awful O
gale O
, O
which O
we O
have O
before O
described O
, O
banished O
every O
human O
hope O
at O
once O
. O
The O
|
      | O
rudder O
snapped O
  O
every B-TIME
half I-TIME
- I-TIME
hour I-TIME
the O
water O
gained O
upon O
the O
hold O
, O
though O
every O
man O
worked O
the O
|
      | O
pumps O
. O
There O
was O
not O
a O
shred O
of O
canvas O
, O
but O
the O
masts O
, O
and O
yards O
, O
and O
stays O
bent O
and O
snapped O

      | O
like O
reeds O
before O
the O
blast O

To O
guide O
her O

she O
was O
driven O
on O

on O

a O

about B-QUANTITY
a I-QUANTITY

Then O
came O
their O

last O

Last B-TIME

such O

I O
really O
hardly O

all O

      | O
Her O

Emmeline B-PERSON

I O

I O
did O
not O
know O

perhaps O

habituated O

that O

very O
strict O

over O
yourself O

more O

      | O

almost O

it O

as O

at O
the O

her O
heavy O

Mr. O

      | O
inexpressibly O
shocked O
at O
the O
change O

something O

judgment O

knowing O
all O

an O

      | O
almost O
crushing O
sense O
of O

the O
pallid O

delicately O

      | O
fragile O

had O
still O
deeper O
claims O

bands O

shaded O

      | O
face O
, O
visible O
under O
the O
pretty O
little O
lace O
cap O

made O
her O
look O
much O
younger O
than O
she O
really O

      | O
was O
, O

so O
delicately O
transparent O

deep O

so O
altered O

so O
improved O

enough O

the O
assembled O
family O

|
      | O
Mrs. O

soon O
perceived O
, O
and O
with O
no O
little O
pain O
, O
that O
Ellen B-PERSON
shrunk O
from O
the O
idea O

being O
well O
enough O
to O
rejoin O
them O
, O
in O
actual O
suffering O
. O
Here O
again O
was O
an O
effect O
of O
that O
same O

      | O
vivid O
imagination O
, O
of O
whose O
existence O
, O
until O
the O
late O
events O

in O
one O
so O
quiet O
, O
seemingly O
so O

      | O
cold O

Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
had O
not O
the O
least O
idea O
of O

Ellen B-PERSON
had O
been O
so O
long O
accustomed O
to O
be O
silent O

      | O
as O
to O
her O
feelings O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
carefully O
to O
conceal O
them O
, O
that O
much O
as O
she O
might O
wish O
and O
intend O
|
      | O
to O
be O
unreserved O
, O
her O
aunt O
feared O
it O
would O
cause O
her O
some O
difficulty O
to O
be O
so O
, O
and O
she O
could O
|
      | O
not O
hope O
to O
succeed O
in O
controlling O
imagination O
, O
unless O
she O
were O

That B-TIME
night I-TIME
, O
however O
, O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
|
      | O
unreserved O
confidence O
gave O
her O
hope O
. O
When O
the O
devotional O
exercises O
, O
in O
which O
she O
had O
joined O

      | O
with O
even O
more O
than O
usual O
earnestness O
and O
fervor O
, O
were O

said O

with O
almost O

      | O
Emmeline B-ORG

confidence O

as O
she O
laid O
her O

so O
very O

very O
happy O

not O

enough O
of O

      | O
what O
is O
past O

I O
did O
so O
dread O
my O
uncle O

return O

so O
tremble O
at O
what O
his O
sentence O
would O
be O
on O

      | O
Edward B-PERSON

myself O

even O
your O
kindness O

not O
remove O

weight O

now O

that O
I O
have O

found O

groundless O

so O
kind O

so O
indulgent O

so O
relieved O

I O
fear O

must O
have O
thought O
more O
of O
his O
anger O
than O
the O
anger O
of O
God O

My O
sin O
remains O
the O

in O
His O

you O

fully O

Indeed O

my O
dear O
Ellen B-PERSON

I O
think O
you O
may O

Our O
Heavenly O
Father O
is O
still O
more O
merciful O
than O

      | O
man O

as O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
so O
clearly O
proved O
to O
you O

in O
the O
long O
conversation O
you O
had O
with O
him O

We O
|
      | O
know O
, O
by O
His B-PERSON
Holy I-PERSON
Word I-PERSON
, O
that O
all O
he O
asks O
is O
sincere O
repentance O

a O
firm O
conviction O

      | O
that O
in O
Him O
only O
we O
are O
made O
sufficiently O
righteous O
for O
our O
penitence O
to O
be O
accepted O

I O

      | O
believe O
, O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
that O
His O
forgiveness O
was O
yours O
, O
long O
before O
I O
could O
give O
you O
mine O
, O
for O
He O
|
      | O
could O
read O
your O
heart O
, O
and O
saw O
the O
reason O
of O
your O
silence O

and O
all O
the O
remorse O

, O
from O
the O
appearances O

against O
you O

I O
might O
not O
even O
guess O
  O

that O
, O
in O
His O

      | O
compassionating O
love O

pity O

He O
permitted O
your O

      | O
of O

      | O
might O

I O
can O
trace O
His O
loving O
providence O
even O
in O
the O
fact O

      | O
of O
your O
finding O
one B-CARDINAL
more O

wanted O

without O
such O

love O
for O

very O

we O
must O
not O
think O

too O
much O
about O
it O

Your O

      | O
inability O
before O
your O

the O
natural O
consequence O
of O
Mr. O

severe O

      | O
representations O

were O
suffering O
too O
much O

from O

a O
complete O
chaos O

when O
you O
most O

the O

As O

under O
all O

The O
earnestness O
of O
truth O
and O
feeling O
was O
always O
so O
impressed O
on O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON

manner O
, O

      | O
whenever O
she O
addressed O
her O
youthful O

Happy O
indeed O

      | O
it O
when O

Why O
will O
not O

rise O
superior O
to O
the O
petty O
employments O

feelings O
too O
often O

attributed O

A O
fortnight O
after O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
's O
arrival O
, O
Ellen B-PERSON
was O
well O
enough O
to O
go O
down O
stairs O
for O
part O

      | O
of O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
and O
even O
to O
read O
and O
write O
a O
little O
. O
She O
was O
so O
very O
anxious O
to O
recommence O
her O
|
      | O
studies O
, O
which O
for O
many B-DATE
months I-DATE
had O
been O
so O
painfully O
neglected O
, O
that O
it O
was O
a O
great O
trial O
to O
|
      | O
her O
, O
to O
find O
her O
head O
was O
not O
yet O
strong O
enough O
for O
the O
necessary O
application O
. O
There O
were O
|
      | O
many O
, O
very O
many O
privations O
and O
trials O
, O
attendant O
on O
convalescence O
after O
so O
severe O
an O
illness O
, O
|
      | O
known O
only O
to O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
own O
heart O
, O
and O
to O
her O
aunt O
's O
quick O
sympathy O
  O
and O
she O
very O
quickly O
|
      | O
learned O
in O
them O
the O
meaning O
of O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
's O
words O
regarding O
religion O
in O
conduct O
and O
|
      | O
feeling O
, O
as O
well O
as O
in O
prayer O
. O
She O
tried O
never O
to O
murmur O
, O
or O
dwell O
on O
the O
wish O
for O
pleasures O
|
      | O
which O
were O
denied O
her O
, O
but O
to O
think O
only O
on O
the O
many O
blessings O
which O
surrounded O
her O
. O
It O
was O
|
      | O
not O
an O
easy O
task O
so O
to O
conquer O
natural O
feeling O
, O
especially O
as O
the O
trial O
and O
its O
conquest O
was O
|
      | O
often O
known O
only O
to O
herself O
  O
but O
the O
earnest O
wish O
, O
indeed O
, O
to O
become O
holy O
in O
daily B-DATE
conduct O
, O
as O

      | O
well O
as O
in O
daily B-DATE
prayer O
, O
never O
left O
her O
mind O
, O
and O
so O
enabled O
her O
at O
length O
fully O
to O
obtain O
|
      | O
it O
. O
| 
  | O
If O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
had O
wanted O
evidence O
of O
her O
husband O
's O
public O
as O
well O
as O
domestic O
worth O
, O
she O
|
      | O
would O
have O
had O
it O
fully O
now O
. O
His O
danger O
and O
his O
preservation O
once O
known O
, O
letters O
of O
regard O
and O
|
      | O
congratulation O
poured O
upon O
him O
, O
and O
Montrose B-PERSON
Grahame I-PERSON
made O
a O
journey O
down O
to O
Oakwood B-ORG
expressly O

      | O
to O

safety O
to O
his O
youthful O

But O
Edward B-PERSON
so O
shrunk O
from O
praise O
or O
admiration O
, O
that O
his O
uncle O
, O
rejoicing O
at O
the O

      | O
feeling O
, O
would O
not O
press O
him O
, O
as O
he O
had O
first B-ORDINAL
intended O
, O
to O
accompany O
him O
to O
Oxford B-ORG
, O
where O
he O

      | O
went O
to O
see O
his O
sons O

Percy O
rated O
him O
soundly O
in O
a O
letter O
for O
not O
coming O
. O
Herbert B-PERSON
seemed O
, O
as O
|
      | O
if O
he O
could O
only O
think O
of O
his O
father O

danger O
, O

thank O
God O
for O
his O
safety O

great O
was O
the O

out O

whispered O
so O
many O
fond O
words O

earnest O

not O
forget O

at O

kept O
up O
such O

fire O
of O
wit O

mirth O
, O
that O
it O
was O
somewhat O

      | O
difficult O
for O
any O
one O
else O
to O
edge O
in O
a O
word O
, O
though O
Edward B-PERSON

sometimes O

contrive O

bring O
a O
whole O
battery O
against O
themselves O

pause O

Edward B-PERSON
to O
the O
window O
, O

their O

      | O
exclamations O
soon O
compelled O

follow O
their O
example O

send O
for O

A O

surrounded O
the O

smiling O

      | O
that O
her O

a O

the O
effect O
so O
strikingly O

Mrs. O

shuddered O

The O
windows O
of O
the O
dining O

room O
had O
been O
thrown O
widely O
open O
, O
and O
as O
the O
rustic O
procession O

      | O
came O
in O
sight O
of O
those O
to O
whom O
their O
whole O
hearts O
tendered O
homage O
, O
they O
halted O
  O
the O
music O

      | O
ceased O
, O
and O
cheer O
on O
cheer O
resounded O
, O
till O
the O
very O
echoes O
of O
the O
old O
park O
were O
startled O
out O
|
      | O
of O
their O
sleep O
, O
and O
sent O
the O
shout O
back O
again O

Percy B-PERSON
was O
among O
them O
in O
a O
moment O
, O
singling O
out O

      | O
old O
Collins B-PERSON
, O
whom O
he O
had O
tried O
repeatedly O
to O
see O
since O
his O
visit O
home O
, O
but O
never O
found O
him O
, O
|
      | O
and O
grasped O
and O
shook O
both O
his O
hands O
with O
the O
full O
vehemence O
of O
his O
character O
, O
pouring O
out O
the O
|
      | O
first B-ORDINAL
words O
that O
chose O
to O
come O
, O
which O
better O
expressed O
his O
grateful O
feelings O
to O
the O
old O
man O
|
      | O
than O
the O
most O
studied O
speech O
. O
William B-PERSON
Grey I-PERSON
had O
already O
received O
substantial O
proofs O
of O
his O
|
      | O
gratitude O
, O
and O
so O
he O
had O
then O
only O
a O
kind O
nod O
, O
and O
a O
joke O
and O
look O
at O
the O
pretty O
, O
blushing O
|
      | O
Susan B-PERSON
, O
which O
said O
a O
vast O
deal O
to O
both O
, O
and O
seemed O
as O
if O
he O
quite O
seconded O
Emmeline B-ORG
's O
plan O
. O
|
      | O
Mingling O
joyously O
with O
all O
, O
he O
had O
bluff O
words O
, O
after O
their O
own O
hearts O
, O
for O
the O
men O
, O
smiles O

      | O
for O
the O
maidens O
, O
and O
such O
wild O
jokes O
for O
the O
children O
, O
as O
lost O
them O
all O
decorum O
, O
and O
made O
them O
|
      | O
shout O
aloud O
in O
their O
glee O
. O
Herbert B-PERSON
seconded O
him O
quite O
as O
well O
as O
his O
quieter O
nature O
would O
|
      | O
allow O
. O
Edward B-PERSON
had O
hung O
back O
, O
even O
when O
his O
name O
was O
called O
out O
lustily O
, O
as O
if O
he O
could O
not O
|
      | O
bear O
such O
homage O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Join O
them O

boy O

humble O
pleasure O

not O

half B-CARDINAL

you O

" O
whispered O
|
      | O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
, O
earnestly O
, O
for O

guessed O
his O
thoughts O
. O
" O

only O
at O
this O
moment O

have O
been O
permitted O
to O
call O
forth O

Do O
not O
underrate O
a O
deed O
which O
|
      | O
all O
must O
admire O
, O
because O
of O
some O
sad O
thoughts O
  O
rather O
resolve O
— O
as O
you O
can O
and O
have O
|
      | O
resolved O
— O
that O
the O
alloy O
shall O
be O
burned O
away O
, O

the O
true O
metal O
alone O

The O
cloud O
dispersed O
from O
brow O
and O
heart O
in O
a O
moment O
  O
and O
he O
was O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
them O
, O
glad O
|
      | O
and O
buoyant O
almost O
as O
Percy B-PERSON
  O
while O
the O
cheer O
which O
greeted O
him O
was O
almost O
overpowering O
to O
his O

      | O
sister O
, O
so O
much O
humble O
, O
yet O
earnest O
feeling O

warmly O
grasping O

provided O
some O

substantial O
refreshment O

your O
long O

slender O
fare O

answered O
Emmeline B-PRODUCT

with O
a O
confusion O
and O

      | O
timidity O
, O

" O

  | O
" O
My O

never O

      | O
Emmeline B-ORG
still O
hesitated O
, O
almost O
painfully O
  O
but O
then O
gathering O
courage O
, O
she O
sat O
down O
to O
her O
|
      | O
harp O
, O
and O
, O
without O
any O
notes O
before O
her O
, O
played O
a O
few O
bars O
of O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
those O
sweet O
, O
thrilling O
|
      | O
Irish B-NORP
melodies O
so O
suited O
to O
her O
instrument O
, O
and O
then O
commenced O
her O
song O
, O
the O
sweetness O
of O
her O
|
      | O
voice O
, O
and O
clearness O
of O
articulation O
atoning O
well O
for O
her O
deficiency O
in O
the O
power O
and O
|
      | O
brilliancy O
which O
characterized O
her O
sister O

The O
words O
were O
exceedingly O
simple O
, O

sung O
with O

      | O
deep O

you O
not O
own O
your O

      | O
offspring O
, O
instead O
of O
, O
by O
silence O
, O
almost O
denying O
them O

" O

  | O
" O
And O
here O
I O
really O
can O
not O

you O
, O
" O
answered O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
  O
" O
I O
can O
not O
imagine O
why O
my O
Emmy O

      | O
should O
conceal O
a O
fact O
that O
could O
only O
give O
pleasure O
to O
us O
all O

" O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
think O
I O
know O

" O
said O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
timidly O
  O
" O
Emmeline O
was O
thinking O
of O
all O
you O
said O
about O
|
      | O
controlling O
an O
impulse O
, O
and O
not O
always O
encouraging O
that O
which O
she O
termed O
inspiration O
, O
and O
|
      | O
perhaps O
she O
thought O
you O
did O
not O
quite O
approve O
of O
her O
writing O
, O
and O
so O
wished O
to O
conceal O
|
      | O
it O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
How O
could O
you O
guess O
so O
exactly O
, O
Ellen B-PERSON
? O
" O
hastily O
answered O
Emmeline B-PRODUCT
, O
forgetting O
, O
in O
her O
|
      | O
surprise O
at O
her O
cousin O
's O
penetration O
, O
that O
she O
betrayed O
herself O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Because O
I O
should O
have O
felt O
the O
same O
, O
" O
said O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
simply O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Then O
I O
must O
have O
explained O
myself O
very O
badly O
, O
my O
dear O

or O
you O
must O
have O
both O

      | O
misunderstood O
me O

I O
did O
not O
mean O
you O
to O
neglect O
such O
on O
enjoyment O
as O

only O
to O
keep O

      | O
it O
in O
its O
proper O
sphere O

not O

it O
to O
take O
the O
place O
of O

equally O

Percy B-PERSON

who O
, O
in O
his O

the O

a O
minute O
afterward O
she O
was O
enjoying O
her O
waltz O
, O
with O
as O
much O
childish O

      | O
glee O
, O
as O
if O
neither O

to O
do O
with O
her O

" O
Why O

all O
Mrs. O

said O

| 
  | O
" O
Because O
, O
my O
love O

it O
is O
very O
apt O
to O
excite O

encourage O
an O
over O
- O
excess O
of O

a O

      | O
habit O
of O
seeing O
things O
other O
than O
they O
really O
are O
, O
and O
engenders O
a O
species O
of O
romantic O

      | O
enthusiasm O
, O
most O
dangerous O
to O
the O
young O
, O
especially O
of O
our O
sex O
, O
whose O
feelings O
generally O

      | O
require O
control O

repression O

To O
a O
well O

regulated O

      | O
temper O

the O
danger O

not O
of O
the O

serious O
kind O
as O
to O
the O
irregulated O
, O
but O
merely O
consists O

      | O
in O
the O
powerful O
temptation O
it O
too O
often O
presents O
to O
neglect O
duties O

employments O
of O
more O

      | O
consequence O
, O
for O
its O
indulgence O

There O
is O
a O
species O
of O
fascination O
in O
the O
composition O
of O
even O

      | O
the O
most O
inferior O
poetry O
, O
which O
urges O
its O
pursuit O
, O
as O
giving O
so O
little O
trouble O

compared O
to O

      | O
the O
perseverance O
necessary O
for O
music O

such O
a O
vast O
amount O
of O
pleasure O

that O
it O

      | O
is O
difficult O
to O
withdraw O
from O
it O

This O
is O
still O
more O
strongly O
the O
case O
when O
the O
young O

Emmeline B-ORG

As O
she O
gets O
older O

her O
taste O

      | O
she O

her O
efforts O

      | O
the O
trouble O

Ellen B-PERSON
listened O
eagerly O

continued O
conversing O
on O

improvement O

till O
the O
prayer O
bell O
rang O

startled O
her O
into O
the O
recollection O
that O

      | O
always O
retired O
nearly B-TIME
an I-TIME

she O
still O

quite O
shrunk O
from O

Percy B-PERSON
stopped O
his O
dance O

converted O
from O

the O
piano O

Herbert B-PERSON
paused O
in O
his O
conversation O
with O
his O
father O

Nothing O
like O

ever O

      | O
marked O
the O
signal O
for O
the B-TIME
hour I-TIME

lighter O
pleasures O
always O
ceased O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes I-TIME

before O
, O
that O

might O
better O

the O
more O
serious O
thought O

service O

Mrs. O

had O
never O

in O
the O
hours O

her O

look O
with O
one B-CARDINAL
of O

her O

youth O

longing O

      | O
for O

see O

much O
as O
it O
deserved O

Miss O

      | O
accompanied O
them O

on O
their O
return O
, O
its O
beauties O
were O
described O
to O

the O

      | O
most O

more O

more O

      | O
green O

more O
brilliantly O
blue O

that O

very O
sound O

of O

it O
dashed O
down O
a O
black O

threw O
up O
spray O

which O
the O
rays O
of O
the O
sun O

      | O
rendered O
so O
beautifully O
iridescent O
, O
as O

seem O
like O

      | O

no O

" O
I O
am O
sure O

Emmeline B-ORG

" O
said O
Ellen B-PERSON
( O
whom O
her O
aunt O
now O
observed O
looked O

      | O
agitated O
and O
flushed O
) O
  O
" O
and O
they O
were O
riding O
so O
fast O
, O
something O
very O
pressing O
must O
have O

      | O
recalled O

indeed O
I O
think O
you O
must O
be O

      | O
mistaken O

for O
your O
uncle O
told O
me O

he O
should O
be O
particularly O
engaged O
to O
- O

Mrs. O

      | O
Hamilton B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
" O
She O
is O
not O
mistaken O

exclaimed O
Caroline B-PERSON

who O
was O
standing O
at O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
windows O

" O

here O

both O
are O

true O
enough O

riding O
quite O
fast O
down O
the O
avenue O

However O
, O
the O

      | O
mystery O

soon O
be O
solved O

" O
| 
  | O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
and O
Edward B-PERSON
entered O
almost O
immediately O
afterward O
, O
the O
latter O
evidently O
very O
much O
|
      | O
agitated O
, O
the O
former O
so O
tranquil O
and O
cheerful O
that O
the O
momentary O
anxiety O
of O
his O
wife O
was O
|
      | O
calmed O
directly O
. O
He O
laughed O
at O
their O
bewilderment O
, O
and O
said O
that O
an O
important O
letter O
had O
|
      | O
reached O
him O
at O
Ashburton B-GPE
, O
summoning O
him O
to O
Plymouth B-ORG
, O
and O
so O
he O
thought O
he O
would O
just O
see O
how O
|
      | O
all O
was O
going O
on O
at O
Oakwood B-ORG
first B-ORDINAL
. O
This O
was O
not O
at O
all O
a O
satisfactory O
reason O
from O
Mr. O
|
      | O
Hamilton B-PERSON
. O
Edward B-PERSON
evidently O
tried O
to O
answer O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
inquiries O
quietly O
, O
but O
he O
could O
not O
, O
and O
|
      | O
exclaiming O
, O
" O
You O
tell O
her O
, O
my O
dear O
uncle O
! O
I O
can O
not O

ran O
out O
of O
the O
room O
. O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
|
      | O
instantly O
changed O
his O
jesting O
manner O
, O
so O
far O
as O
quietly O
and O
affectionately O
to O
seat O
his O
niece O
|
      | O
beside O
him O
, O
and O
tell O
her O
, O
cautiously O
and O
kindly O
, O
the O
real O
cause O
of O
their O
unexpected O
return O

      | O
Orders O
had O
been O
sent O
to O
the B-ORG
Sea I-ORG
Queen I-ORG
, O
to O
sail O
much O
sooner O
than O
was O
expected O
, O
and O
therefore O
he O
|
      | O
had O
deferred O
his O
business O

and O
returned O
with O
Edward B-PERSON
directly O
. O

" O

trial O

all O

ask O

in O

      | O
such O
a O
tone O
of O
quiet O
sorrow O

A O
low O
cry O
escaped O
involuntarily O
from O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
lips O
, O
as O
she O
buried O
her O
face O
on O
the O
cushion O
of O

      | O
the O
couch O
where O
she O
was O
sitting O
, O
and O
an O
exclamation O
of O
surprise O
and O
regret O
broke O
from O
all O
. O
|
      | O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
felt O
it O
almost O
as O
much O
as O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
from O
not O
only O
her O
own O
unspoken O
anxiety O
, O
as O
to O
|
      | O
whether O
indeed O
his O
home O
influence O
would O
save O
him O
from O
temptation O
in O
future O
, O
but O
that O
she O
could O
|
      | O
enter O
into O
every O
thought O

feeling O
which O
in O
Ellen B-GPE
must O
so O
aggravate O
the O
actual O

      | O
parting O
— O
always O
a O
sorrow O
in O
itself O
. O
After O
a O
few O
minutes O
Ellen B-PERSON
raised O
her O
head O
, O
and O
, O
though O
her O

      | O
cheek O
was O
perfectly O
colorless O

checked O

only O
regained O
his O
natural O
light O

Ellen B-PERSON
had O
taken O
her O
usual O

      | O
place O
in O
the O
family O

always O
declaring O

been O
the O
origin O

      | O
was O
another O
so O
active O
in O

that O
Edward B-PERSON

only O
to O
give O
a O
hint O

The B-TIME
hours I-TIME
wore O
on O

the O
evening B-TIME

concluded O

still O
the O
family O
lingered O
in O

the O
library O
: O
so O
many O
things O
there O
seemed O
to O
say O

for O
Mr. O
Hamilton B-PERSON

Miss O

not O

let O
the O

talk O

the O

when O
one B-CARDINAL
struck O

there O
was O
a O
general O
start O

an O
unanimous O

spoke O
kindly O

firmly O

there O
was O
a O
general O
move O

Edward B-PERSON
laughingly O
promised O
to O

      | O
send O
his O
cousins O
the O
very O
best O
box O
of O
rouge O

Mrs. O

knew O
the O
human O

well O

When O

went O
to O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
the O
paroxysm O
of O
natural O

      | O
sorrow O
had O
had O
vent O

her O
sympathy O

her O
earnestly O
expressed O
conviction O

      | O
beholding O
error O

remorse O

one O
so O

not O

comfort O

The O

      | O
tears O
indeed O
might O
still O

flowed O
the O
faster O
, O
perhaps O
, O
at O
the O
voice O

there O

      | O
was O
healing O

them O

when O
her O
aunt O
left O
her O

go O
to O
Edward B-PERSON

she O
sent O
him O
a O
fond O
message O

that O
she O

better O

was O
late O
before O
Mrs. O

will O
not O
repeat O
all O

all O
that O
that O
fond O

relative O
so O
earnestly O

said O

Not O
much O

      | O
in O
actual O
words O
of O
counsel O
had O
she O
ever O
before O

feeling O
that O
that O
duty O
was O

      | O
better O
performed O
by O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON

his O
uncle O

She O
had O
simply O
tried O

influence O
him O
by O
the O

      | O
power O
of O
love O

of O
forbearance O

of O
sympathy O
with O
his O

errors O

the O
fearful O
anxiety O

Ellen B-PERSON

danger O

painful O
illness O
had O
occasioned O
herself O

      | O
individually O

she O
had O
never O
spoken O

or O
even O
let O
fall O
a O
sentence O
which O
could O
reproach O
him O
as O

      | O
the O
cause O
of O
all O
  O
and O
therefore O
, O
now O
that O
she O
did O
give O
her O
anxious O
affection O
words O
, O
they O
were O

      | O
so O
spoken O

never O
forgot O
them O

now O

conclusion O

them O

my O
beloved O
boy O

They O

      | O
deserted O
you O

by O
the O
insidious O
sentiments O
of O
a O
most O
unhappy O
man O
, O
your O
religion O

      | O
was O
shaken O

you O
flung O
aside O

scorn O

misbelief O

The O
influences O

based O
on O
that O
alone O

my O
Edward B-PERSON

appear O
perhaps O

entreating O
me O
to O
exchange O

      | O
him O

that O
in O
our O
most O
serious O
moments O
we O
might O
think O
of O
each O

It O
was O
such O
an O
unusually O

      | O
serious O
speech O
for O
him O

that O
it O
seemed O
to O
thrill O
me O
with O
a O
vague O
forboding O

which O
was O
only O
too O

      | O
soon O
realized O
. O
I O
never O
saw O
him O
again O

that O
little O
book O
indeed O
increased O
in O
value O
. O
" O

Her O
voice O
faltered O
, O
for O
even O
yet O
the O
memory O
of O
her O
brother O

so O
dear O

could O

never O

Edward B-PERSON
reiterated O
his O
eager O
assurance O
that O
it O
should O
be O

equally O
valuable O

not O

himself O
any O

      | O

THE O
BIRTHDAY O
GIFT O
. O
| 
  | O
Brightly O
and O
placidly O
, O
as O
the O
course O
of O
their O
own O
beautiful O
river O
, O
did O
the B-DATE
days I-DATE
now O
pass O
to O
|
      | O
the O
inmates O
of O
Oakwood B-ORG
. O
Letters O
came O
from O
Edward B-PERSON
so O
frequently O
, O
so O
happily O
, O
that O
hope O
would O
|
      | O
rest O
calmly O
, O
joyously O
, O
even O
on O
the O
thought O
of O
him O
. O
He O
never O
let O
an O
opportunity O
pass O
, O
writing O
|
      | O
always O
to O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
( O
which O
he O
had O
scarcely O
ever O
done O
before O
) O
, O
and O
inclosing O
his O
letters O
to O
|
      | O
Ellen B-PERSON
open O
in O
hers O
. O
The O
tone O
, O
the O
frequency O
, O
were O
so O
changed O
from O
his O
last O
, O
that O
his O
family O
|
      | O
now O
wondered O
they O
had O
been O
so O
blind O
before O
in O
not O
perceiving O
that O
his O
very O
seeming O
liveliness O
|
      | O
was O
unnatural O
and O
overstrained O
. O
| 
  | O
With O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
too O
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
's O
anxious O
care O
was O
bringing O
in O
fair O
promise O
of O
success O
— O
the O
|
      | O
mistaken O
influences O
of O
her O
childhood O
, O
and O
their O
increased O
effect O
from O
a O
morbid O
imagination O
, O
|
      | O
produced O
from O
constant O
suffering O
, O
appearing O
, O
indeed O
, O
about O
to O
be O
wholly O
eradicated O
. O
Anxious O
to O
|
      | O
remove O
all O
sad O
associations O
connected O
with O
the O
library O
, O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
having O
determined O
|
      | O
herself O
to O
superintend O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
studies O
, O
passed O
long O
mornings O
in O
that O
ancient O
room O
with O
her O
, O
so O
|
      | O
delightfully O
, O
that O
it O
became O
associated O
only O
with O
the O
noble O
authors O
whose O
works O
, O
or O
extracts O
|
      | O
from O
whom O
, O
she O
read O
and O
reveled O
in O
, O
and O
which O
filled O
her O
mind O
with O
such O
new O
thoughts O
, O
such O
|
      | O
expansive O
ideas O
, O
such O
calming O
and O
earnest O
truths O
, O
that O
she O
felt O
becoming O
to O
herself O
a O
new O
|
      | O
being O
. O
Lively O
and O
thoughtless O
as O
Emmeline B-PRODUCT
she O
could O
not O
now O
indeed O
become O
— O
alike O
as O
their O
|
      | O
dispositions O
naturally O
were O
  O
but O
she O
was O
more O
quietly O
, O
enduringly O
happy O
than O
she O
had O
ever O
|
      | O
remembered O
her O
self O
. O
| 
  | O
There O
was O
only O
one O
alloy O
, O
one B-CARDINAL
sad O
thought O
, O
that O
would O
intrude O
causing O
a O
resolution O
, O
which O
|
      | O
none O
suspected O
  O
for O
, O
open O
as O
she O
had O
become O
, O
she O
could O
breathe O
it O
to O
none O
but O
Ellis B-PERSON
, O
for O
she O
|
      | O
alone O
could O
assist O
her O
, O
though O
it O
required O
many O
persuasions O
and O
many O
assurances O
, O
that O
she O
|
      | O
never O
could O
be O
quite O
happy O
, O
unless O
it O
was O
accomplished O
, O
which O
could O
prevail O
on O
her O
to O
grant O
|
      | O
it O
. O
Ellen O
knew O
, O
felt O
, O
more O
and O
more O
each O
week O
, O
that O
she O
could O
not O
rest O
till O
she O
had O
labored O
|
      | O
for O
and O
obtained O
, O
and O
returned O
into O
her O
aunt O
's O
hands O
the O
full O
sum O
she O
had O
so O
involuntarily O
|
      | O
appropriated O
. O
The O
only O
means O
she O
could O
adopt O
demanded O
such O
a O
seemingly O
interminable O
period O
of O
|
      | O
self O
- O
denial O
, O
patience O
, O
and O
perseverance O
, O
that O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
as O
Ellis B-ORG
represented O
and O
magnified O
all O
|
      | O
connected O
with O
it O
, O
she O
felt O
as O
if O
, O
indeed O
, O
she O
could O
not O
nerve O
herself O
for O
the O
task O
, O
much O
as O
|
      | O
she O
desired O
to O
perform O
it O
  O
but O
prayer O
enabled O
her O
to O
face O
the O
idea O
, O
till O
it O
lost O
its O
most O
|
      | O
painful O
aspect O
, O
and O
three B-DATE
months I-DATE
after O
Edward B-PERSON
's O
departure O
she O
commenced O
the O
undertaking O
, O
|
      | O
resolved O
that O
neither O
time O
nor O
difficulty O
should O
deter O
her O
from O
its O
accomplishment O
. O
What O
her O
|
      | O
plan O
was O
, O
and O
whether O
it O
succeeded O
, O
we O
may O
not O
here O
inform O
our O
readers O
. O
Should O
we O
be O
permitted O
|
      | O
to O
resume O
our O
History B-WORK_OF_ART
of I-WORK_OF_ART
the I-WORK_OF_ART
Hamilton I-WORK_OF_ART
Family I-WORK_OF_ART

both O
will O
be O

| 
  | O
Greatly O
to O
Caroline B-GPE
's O
delight O
, O
the O
following O
October B-DATE
was O
fixed O
for O
them O
to O
leave O
Oakwood B-ORG
, O
|
      | O
and O
, O
after O
a O
pleasant O
tour O
, O
to O
make O
the O
long O
anticipated O
visit O
to O
London B-GPE
. O
There O
would O
then O
be O
|
      | O
three B-DATE
or I-DATE
four I-DATE
months I-DATE
' I-DATE
quiet O
for O
her O
to O
have O
the O
benefit O
of O
masters O
, O
before O
she O
was O
introduced O
, O
|
      | O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
fondly O
hoped O
, O
that O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
year I-DATE
's I-DATE
residence O
at O
home O
, O
fraught O
as O
it O
had O
been O
|
      | O
with O
so O
much O
of O
domestic O
trial O
, O
and O
displaying O
so O
many O
hopeful O
and O
admirable O
traits O
in O
|
      | O
Caroline B-GPE
's O
disposition O
, O
would O
have O
lessened O
the O
danger O
of O
the O
ordeal O
of O
admiration O
and O
gayety O
|
      | O
which O
she O
so O
dreaded O
for O
her O
child O
— O
whether O
it O
had O
or O
not O
, O
a O
future O
page O
will O
disclose O
. O
| 
  | O
To O
Emmeline O
this O
arrangement O
was O
a O
source O
of O
extreme O
regret O
, O
individually O
, O
in O
which O
Ellen B-PERSON
|
      | O
now O
quite O
sympathized O
. O
But O
Emmeline B-ORG
had O
never O
forgotten O
her O
mother O
's O
gentle O
hint O
, O
that O
too O
|
      | O
great O
indulgence O
of O
regret O
or O
sorrow O
becomes O
selfishness O
, O
and O
she O
tried O
very O
hard O
to O
create O
|
      | O
some O
anticipation O
of O
pleasure O
, O
even O
in O
London B-GPE
. O
Ellen O
would O
not O
look O
to O
pleasure O
, O
but O
merely O
|
      | O
tried O
to O
think O
about O
— O
and O
so O
, O
when O
called O
upon O
, O
cheerfully O
to O
resign O
that O
which O
was O
now O
so O
|
      | O
intensely O
enjoyable O
— O
her O
studies O
with O
her O
aunt O
— O
and O
so O
benefit O
by O
them O
as O
to O
give O
Miss O
Harcourt B-PERSON
|
      | O
no O
trouble O
when O
she O
was O
again O
under O
her O
care O
  O
as O
she O
knew O
she O
and O
Emmeline B-PERSON
must O
be O
, O
more O
than O
|
      | O
they O
had O
been O
yet O
, O
when O
Caroline B-PERSON
's O
introduction O
, O
and O
their O
residence O
in O
London B-GPE
, O
would O
take O
Mr. O

      | O
and O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
so O
much O
from O
domestic O
pursuits O
and O
pleasures O
, O
and O
, O
even O
when O
at O
home O
, O
compel O
|
      | O
them O
to O
be O
so O
frequently O
engrossed O
with O
a O
large O
circle O
of O
friends O
, O
and O
all O
the O
variety O
of O
|
      | O
claims O
on O
their O
attention O
and O
time O
, O
which O
a O
season O
in O
London B-GPE
includes O
. O

It O
was O
again O
the B-DATE
7th I-DATE
of I-DATE
June I-DATE
, O
and O
Ellen B-PERSON
's O
birthday O
. O
Accustomed O
from O
the O
time O
she O
became O
an O
|
      | O
inmate O
of O
Oakwood B-ORG
to O
regard O
the O
anniversary O
of O
her O
birth O
in O
the O
same O
serious O
light O
as O
Mrs. O
|
      | O
Hamilton B-PERSON
had O
taught O
her O
cousins O
— O
as O
a O
day O
of O
quiet O
reflection O
, O
as O
well O
as O
of O
thankfulness O
and O
|
      | O
joy O
, O
as O
one O
that O
, O
closing O
and O
recommencing O
another B-DATE
year I-DATE
of O
their O
individual O
lives O
, O
taught O
them O
|
      | O
that O
they O
were O
becoming O
more O
and O
more O
responsible O
beings O
— O
it O
was O
not O
much O
wonder O
that O
Ellen B-PERSON
, O
|
      | O
the O
whole O
of O
that B-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
should O
seem O
somewhat O
less O
cheerful O
than O
usual O
. O
She O
had O
indeed O
had O
many O
|
      | O
sources O
of O
thankfulness O
and O
joy O
during O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
year I-DATE
, O
but O
a O
heart O
and O
mind O
like O
hers O
could O
not O
|
      | O
recall O
its O
principal O
event O
without O
a O
return O
of O
sorrow O
. O
Mrs. O
Hamilton B-PERSON
would O
not O
notice O
her O
now O
|
      | O
unusual O
sadness O
until O
the B-TIME
evening I-TIME
, O
when O
perceiving O
her O
standing O
engrossed O
in O
thought O
beside O
|
      | O
one O
of O
the O
widely O
- O
opened O
windows O

near O
which O
Caroline B-GPE
was O
watering O
some O
lovely O
flowers O
on O
the O

      | O
terrace O
, O
she O
gently O
approached O
her O
, O
and O
, O
putting O
her O
arm O
round O
her O
, O
said O
, O
fondly O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
You O
have O
thought O
quite O
seriously O

quite O
long O
enough O

my O
dear O
Ellen B-PERSON
  O
I O
must O

      | O
not O

any O
more O
such O
very O
silent O
meditations O

That O
there O
is O
something O
to O
regret O
in O
the O

      | O
retrospect O
of O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
year I-DATE

I O
acknowledge O
, O
but O
you O
must O
not O
let O
it O
poison O
all O
the O
sources O
of O

      | O
thankfulness O

it O
brings O
likewise O

replied O
Ellen B-PERSON

      | O
with O
a O
sudden O
burst O

emotion O
