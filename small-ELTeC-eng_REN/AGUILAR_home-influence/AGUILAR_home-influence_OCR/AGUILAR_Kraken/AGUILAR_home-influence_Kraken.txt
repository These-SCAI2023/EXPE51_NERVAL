PREEACE.
TuL following astory will, the autlor trusts, sufficiently
illustrate its title to require but few worls in thc way
of preface. She is only anxious to impress two faets on
the minds of her readers. The one-that haing heen
brought before the publio principally as the author of
Jewish workcs, and as an explainer of the HIebrew Faith,
some Christian mothers might fear that the present
Worke has the same tendency, and hcsitate to place it
in the hanls of teir ehildren. She, therefore, begs tn
assure them, that as a simple domestic story, the
characters in which are all Christians, belieing in and
practising that religion, all doetrinal pcints hae been
most cnrefully aoidcd, the author seeking only to illus-
trate the spirit of true piety, and the virtues always desig-
natel as the Christian virtues thence proceeding. Her sole
aim, with regard to Religion, has been to incite a train
of serious and loving thoughts towards God and man,
especially towards those with whom IIe hss Iinked ns in
the precious ties of parent and child, brother and sister,
master and pupil.
PEFACE.
Tle seeond point she is desirous to bring forward, is
her helief, that in childhool and youth the spolen senti-
ment is one of the safest guides to individual character;
and tlat if, terefore, she hare written more conversa-
tion than may appear absolutely neecessary for the
elucidation of  Home Influence,'' or the interest of the
narratie, it is from no wish to be diffuse, but merely to
illustrate her own bcliof. STIENT is the ehicle of
ruocI, and oor the origin of acros. CIhIil-
lren and youth hae very seldomn the poer to evinee
character by action, and searcely if ever understand the
mystery of thought; and therefore their unrestrainel
conversation may often greatly aid parents and teachers
in ncuiring a correct idea of their natural disposition,
and in gising hints for the mode of education each
may demand.
Leaving te beaten track of works written for the
young, tle author's aim has been to nssist in the education
of the n, bclicving that of infinitely grenter im-
portance than the mere instruction of the atIxD, for the
briglt awakeuing of the latter, depends far more on
the hnppy influences of the former than is generally
supposed.
Tluce moral of the following story the author acknow-
ledges is addressel to mothers only, for on them so
mueh of the responeibility of lIome Influence derolves.
rREACE.
vii
On them, more than on auy other, depends the well-doing
anl happiness, or the error and grief, not of chillhood
alone, but of the far more dangerous period of youth.
A prefaea is not the place to enter on their mission.
The author's only wish i, to aid by the thoughts,
which in some young mothers, anxious and cager to
perform their office, her story may excite. To daughters
also, she hopes it may not bc found cntirely useless, for
on them rests so much of the happiness of home, in the
simple thonght of, and attention to, those little things
hich so bless and inigorate domestie life. Op-
portunities to evince the more striking sirtues women
may never have, but for the cultiation an performancee
of te lesscr, they are called upon each day.
Should the story be deemcd so far incomplete, as not
sufficiently to illustrate the fuits of the Home Influ-
ence it narrates, the conclusion, in a separate stor,
shall willingly he gien.

A LAYCR.-A PROMIISE.-A NLW RELATION.
Ix a very beautiful partor Wales, beteen the northern
boundaries of Glamorgan and the south-eastern of Car-
marthenshire, there stood, some twenty or thirty years
ago. a small straggling village. Its locality was so
completely eoncealed that tho appearance of a gentle-
man's carriage, or in fact of any vehicle superior to a
light spring-cart, vas of such extremely rare occur-
rence as to be dated, in the annals of Llangwillan, as
a remarkable eent, providing the simple villagers with
amusing wonderment for weeks.
The village was scattered oer the side of a steep and
rugged hill; and on the enst, emerging from a thiek
hedge of yews and larcles, peeped forth the pic-
turesque old church, whose tin-coated spire glittering
in tle faintest sunshine removed all appearance of
gloom from the thick trees, and seemed to whisper;
whateer darkness lingered round, liglt was always
shining there. The churehyard, which the yews and
larches sereened, was a complete natural gurlen, from
the loly cottage flowers, planted by loving hands
over many a rasy grase, and so hallowed that not a

luxuriance ant beauty. A pretty cottage, whose white
walls were coverc with jasmine, roses, and honey-
suckle, marked tle humble residence of the village
minister who, though in worldly rank only a poor
eurate, from his spiritual gifts deserved a much higher
grade.
A gurgling stream ran leaping and sparkling over the
eggy hill till it formed a deep wide hel for itself along
the road leading to the nearest town, embanked on one
side by a tall leafy hctge, nnd on the other by rich grase
and meadow flowers. By the side of this strenm greps
of village children were continually found, sometimes
reaeing for some particular flower or inseet, or flonting
pieces of wool with a twig stuek npright within them
as tiny fleets; but this amusemcnt had gien place thce
last ten days to the greater excitement of watching the
progress of a miniature frigate, the workmanship of a
oung lad who had only cry lately become an inmate
of tle sillage. All had been at length completed, sails,
ropes, and masts, with a egree of nentness and benuty,
showving not only ingenuity but ohservation: and once
lovely summer eveing the ceremony of launching took
place. or n few minutea she totteret anl reeledl amidst
the tiny brcakers, then sudlenly regained her equilibrium
and dashed gallantly along. A loud shout burst from
the group, from all save the owner, a beautiful boy of
some twelve years, who contented himself with raising
his slight figure to its fll height, and looliug prouly
nd triumphantly round him. One glanee vould sufiicc

absorhed was the general attention that tle vcry unusual
saund of carriage-wheels as unremarked until close
beside them, and then so astounding was the sight of a
priate cnrriage, and the coaclman's ery simple ques-
tion if that road led to the illage, that all hung back
confsed. The owner of the little sessel, however, an-
swered proudly and briefl in the affirmatie. `` And
c you dircct me, my good boy,''inquired a lady, looking
from the window, and smiling kindly at the abashed
group, `` to the residence of MIr. Fortescue, it is out of
the illage, is it not ?
 Mrs. Fortescuel'' repeated the boy eagerly, and
gladly, and his cap was off his head in a moment, and
the bright sunshine streamed on na face of such remark-
able benuty, and withal so familiar, that thonugh the lady
bent eagerly forward to address him, emotion so choked
her vaice that the lad was enabled to reply to her inquiry,
and direct the coachman to the only inn of the village,
and they had driven oif hefore words returned.
The bhoy looked eagcrly after tlem, then desiring one
of his companions to meet the lady at the inn, and guide
her to the cottage, caught up his little vessel, and darted
off aeross some fiels which le by a shorter cut to the
same place.
It was a very humble dwelling, so surrounded by hills
that their shadow always seemed to overhang it: yet
within, the happy temper of a poor widow and her
daughter kept up a perpetual sunshine. Three weeks
previous to the evening we have mentioned, a lady and
two children had arriel at Llangwillan, unablc to pro-
ceed farther from the severe indisposition of the former.
They were unattended, and the drier only knew that

their destination was Swansea; he helieel tley had been
shipwrecked off Pembroke, and that the poor lady was
ery ill wen she commenced her journey, but the curious
inquiries of the illagers could elicit nothing more.
Mr. Mrvin, with characteristic benevolenee, devotel
himself to ensuring, as far ns he could, the comfort of
the invalid; hal her removed from the inn to WYidow
MlIorgan's eottage, confidcut that there she would at

disease was mortal, but that is presence and gentle
accents irritated instead of soothed. Ill-temper and

more and mre futile. It was some days hefore she
could even be persuaded to write to te relative sle wns

the care of relations inlced, but utter strangers to him,

as serious faults, while she felt them actually virtues;
anl agony for him in the dread of what he might be
vallel pon to cndure, would deluge her pillow with
passionate tears, and shako her slight frame as with

Thoe ay we have mentioned, Elward had bceen absent
longer than usual, and towars evening MIrs. Fortescue
awoke from a troubled sleep to brood oer these thoughts,
tiIl they had produced their usual effect in tears and
sobs, the more painfnl to witness from the inereasing
physicnl ineapacity to struggle with them.
A little girl, between ton and eleven years old, was
seated on a low wooden stool, lalf ceoncealed by the
coarse curtain of the bed, employel in sewing some
bright gilt buttons on a blue jacket. It seemed hard
work for those small delicate hands; but she did not
look np from her task till roused by the too familiar
sound of her mother'as suffering, and then, as she rised
her head, nnd flng back the heavy and somewhat dis-
ordered ringlets, thc impulse scemed to be to spring up
and try to soothc, bnt a mournful expression quickly
succeeded, and she snt sereral minutes without moving.
At lcngth, as MIrs. Fortescue's sobs seemel almost to
suffocate her, the child gently bent oer her, saying,
ery timily, ``bDcnr mamma, slhinll I cnll Wido MIorgan,
or can I get anything for yon'' and, without waiting
for a reply, save the angry negative to the first question,
she held a glass of water to her mother's lips and

Fortescue revived sufficiently to inquire where Edwarl
as.
IIe has gone down to the stream to launch his little
frigate, MIamma, and asked me to fasten these buttons
on his jacket to mke it look like a sailor' s meanwhile;
I do not tink he ill be very long now.''
Mrs, Fortescue made no rejoinder, except to utter aloud
those thoughits which had caused her previous paroxysm,
and her little girl, after a very eident struggle with
her own painful timidity, ventured to say:
' But why shonld you fear so much for Edwad, dear
MIamma? Eeryhody loes him and admires him, so I
am sure my aunt and ncle will''
Your annt may for my sake, but she will not love
or bear with his childish faults as I have done; and
your mncle is such a harsh, stern man, that there is
little hope for his forbearance with my poor Ldward.
And he is so franke and bold, he will not know how een
to conceal his boyish errors, and he will be pnnished,
and his fine spirit broken, and who will bhe there to
shield and soothe him .'
I may be nble sometimes, 3Iamma, anl indced, in-
deed, I will wleneer I can,'' replied her child, with
aiicctipng carnestness. tI loe him so ery very much,
and I know he is so much better than I am, that it will
be very easy to hclp him whenever I can.''
 Will you promise me, Ellen, will you really promise
me to shield him, and save him from harshness when-
eer it is in your power,'' exclaimerl MIrs. Fortcscue, ss

in her own heart with a solemnity and firmess ol pnr-
pose little imagined by her mother, who when she
demanded it, conceived neither its actual purport nor
extent; she only fclt relieed tht llward would have
some one by him to love him ad enable him to conccal
his errors, if he should commit any.
IHad she studicd and known the character af Ellen
as she did that of her son, that promise would perhaps
nerer hae been asked; nor would she so incautiously
nnd mistakenly have laid so great a stress upon con
cealment, as the only sure means of guarding from
blame. From her childhoad Mrs, kortescue had been
a creature of passion and impulse, and materuity had
unhappily not altered one tittle of ler chnracter. In
what manner, or nt what cost, Ellen might be ennbled
to keep that promise, never entcred her mind. It had

morbid indulgence of one exaggeratel thought.

MIrs. Fortescue prsesed him closcr and closer to her,

tears ingled with them and fell upou his cheek.
 Don't cry, Mlamma, dear? indeed, indeed, my aunt

hope than her words.

But to Edward's gief and astonislent, so little
was he conscious of his mother's exhansted stnte, the

was, seemed to bring increase of suffering insted of

earnest tenderness, `` lismiss such painful thoughts at

but he forgae it, would have recceired your husband,

name was the last word upon his lips. But this is no

terrupting erself, as she met Edward's bright eyes fixed
wonderingly upon her face, and noticed the excessive
paleness of Ellen's cheek.  You look weary, my love,''
she said, kindly, drawing her iece to her, and affec-

lowed the agitating conversation between them. MIrs.
HIamilton wnas irresistibly attracted towards him, and
rather wondered that Ellen should stay away so long.
She did not know that Edward had spent almost the

sincc llcn had quitted her mother's room.

O leasing tle cottage, Ellen hastily traverse the
little garden, and entered a narrow lane, leading to
MIr. Myrvin's dwelling. IIer little heart was swelling
high within her, and the confinement she hal endured,
the oonstant control she exercised for fear she should
add to her othcr's irritation, combinel with the exs-
treme delicacy of natnral constitution, hsd so wenkened
her, as to rcnder the slightest exertion painful. She
had becn so often reproved as fretful and ill-tempered,
whenerer in tears, that she alwaya checked and con-
cealed them. She had been so frequcntly told that she
lid not know what aflection was, that she was so
inanimate and cold, that though she did not understand
tle actual meaning of the words, sle bcliered she was
lifferent to any one else, and was uhappy without
knowing why. Compared with her brother, she ccr-
tainly was neither a pretty nor an cnging child.
Wcnlly from her birth, her residence in India had in-
creascd constitntional delicaey, nd while to a watchful
eye the expression of her counlcuace denoted constant
sutfering, the leelless anl superlicial observer would
condemn it as pcevishness, and so unnatural to a young
ehild, that noting but eonfirmel ill-tempecr could have
produccd it. The soft bcnutifully-formed black cye

eaused her to be remarked as a very plain ehild, which
in reality she was not. Accustomed to hear beaut
extolled aboe everything else, beholding it in her
mother and brother, and imagining it was dward's
great beauty that always made him so beloved and
petted, an eil-lisposed child would ave felt nothing
but ensy and dislike towards him. But Ellen felt
neither. She loed im levotedly ; but that any one
could love her, ow that the only one who eer had-
her idolized father-was dcad, she thought impossible.
WYhy er henrt and temples beat so quickly as she
left er mother's room-why the promise she had so
lately made should so cling to her mind, that eren her
aunt's arrival could not remove it-why she felt so
giddy and wenk as to render walking painful, the poor
child could not have told, but, unable at length to go
farther, she sat don on a grassy bank, ad helieing
herself qite alone, cried bitterly. Seeral minutes
passed aud she did not loaok up, till a well-known voice
inquired:-
`Dear Ellen, vhat is the matter? Whnt has lap-
pencd to grieve you so to-dayl on't you tell me?''
Indeed, indeed, I do not know, dear rthur; I
only feel-feel-as if I had not so much strength as I
had as few days ago-and, and I could not help crying.''
 Yu are not vell, Ellen,'' repliel her companion,
a fine lad of sixteen, and Mr. Myrsin's only son.
 You are looking paler than I ever saw you bcfore ; let
me call my father. ou know he is always pleased
when he sees you, and he hoped you would have been

No, Arthr, indeed I cnnot; he will think I sve
forgotten all he said to me the last time I saw him, and,
indeed, lI have not-but I-I do not know what is the

And, in spite of all her efforts to restrain them, the
tears would burst forth afrcsh; and Arthur, fiuding all
his efforts at consolation ineffcetual, contcnted himself
with putting his arm round her and kissing thcm away.
A few minutes afterwards his father appeared.

her tears would permit; `` she has been very ill just now,

'MIrs. IIamilton has arried thenl I am rejoiced

down by Ellen, he took one of her hanls in his, and
said, kindly, `` Something hns gricved ny little girl this
eening; I will not ask what it is, because you may not
like to tell me; but you must not imagine evils, Ellen.

: You are not in such strong health as your brother,
my dear little girl, and yon hare had many things to
make you uhappy, which Edward has not. But yon
must try and reember that even if it plcase God
that somctimes you should be more sorrowful than
other children, He loes you notwithstanding. I am
sure you hare naot forgotten the story of Joseph that
I told you a few Sunlays ago. God so loved im, as to
gie him the powcr of foretelling eents, and enabling
him to do a great del of good, but when he was taken
away from his father and sold as a slave, and thrown inta
prison amongst cruel strangers, he conld not have been
ery happy, Ellen. Yet still, young as he was, little
more than a child in those days, and thrown amonget
those who did not know right from wrong, he remem-
berel all that his father had taught him, and prayed ta
Gol, and tried to loe and obey IIim; and God was
pleased with him, and gavc him graee to continue good,
and at last so blessedl him, as to permit him to see his
dear fatler and darling brother agin,''
`But Joseph was his father's faorite cehild,'' was
Elleu's sole rejoinder; and the tears, which were checkced
in the eagcrness with which she had listened, seemed
again ready to burst fortl. IIe must have been

nand how indelibly his reply was registered in the child's
memory,
It is a question none can answer positively, Ellen,
but it is my own firm bclief, that the heloved ones
we ave lost are permittel to watch oer and loe us
still, and that they see us and are often near us, though
we cannot sce them. DBut even to help Edwarl,'' he
continued, somewhat anxiously, ``you mst not be

Hce was interrupted by the appearance of a stranger,
who, aldressing him courteously, apologisel for his in-
trusion, and noticing the children, inquired if both were
lis.
Mr. Mrin replied, e could only lay claim to one;
the little girl was MIiss Fortcsecne.
And my name is lIamilton, so I think I have an
uncle's prisilege,'' ws the reply; and Ellen, to her asto-
ishment, received an affectionate embrace from the
unkown relative, whom her mother's ill-jutlged worls
had tsught her aetually to drca. MIr. MIyrvin gladly
welcomed him, and, in the interest of the conversation
which followed, forgot the lcsson he had heen so anxious
to impress upon llen. Arthur aceompanied her to the

the cottage together.
Days merged into weeks, and still Mfrs. Fortescue

the nenrest town was twenty miles distant), but not a
selfish or repining thonght entered MIrs. Hamilton's
mind. It was filled with thankfulness, not only that
she was pcrmitted thus to tend a sister, whom neither
error, nor absence, nor silencee could estrange from er
heart, but that she was spared long cnough for her
gentle influence and enduring loe to have some effect
in canging her train of thought, clming that fearful
irritability, and by slow degrees permitting her to look
with resignation and penitent hope to that hour which
no human cfort could aert. Tlat MJr. Myrvin should
seek MIrs. IIamilton's society and lelight in conversing
with her, MIrs. Fortescue considered so perfcetly natu-
ral, that the conversations which took place in her sick
roon, wheneer she was strong enough to bear tlem,
excited neither surprise nor impatienee. Diferent as
sho was, wilfully as she had alway negleeted the mild
counscls and example of her sister, the years of sepa-
ration anl but too often excited self-reproach had fully
nwuakenel her to Mlrs. lImilton's superiority. She had
never found nny one at all like her,-so good and holy,
yet so uttecrly unassuming; and the strong naffcetion,
een the deep emotion in one sually so controlled
with which her sister hat met her, nnturally incrceascd
these fcclings.

betrayed in the last worls was a painful contrast with
the lightness of her previous tone.
Mr, Myrvsin anserel soothingly, and for tle first
time his words were patiently received. From listening
listlessly MIrs. Fortescue, by slow degrees, became in-
terested in the conrersations between him and MIr. and
Mr. Iamilton, and so a change in sentiments was gra-
dually wrought, which by any other and harsher me-
thod of proeeeding would have been sought for in vain.
One evening as MIrs. IIamilton sat watcling the
faded countenance of her patient, and recalling those
days of youth and buoyancy, when it seemed as if
neither death nor care could ever hae assailed one ss
bright and lovely, Edward, before he sought his faorite
stream, threw his arms round her neck, and pressed
his rosy lips o her cheek, as thus to wish her good
bye.
 IIe will repay you for all yonr care, learest
Lmmeline,'' his mother said, with a heasy sigl, as he
left the room; ` I Iow he has what you and your
husbund will think faults, but, oh, for my sake, do not
treat him harshly; his noble spirit will be broken if

: Denrest Elennor, dismiss all such fears. Am I not
a mother equally vith yourself? and do you think when
your chilren become mine I shall show any difference

' Indeed, indeed, 1I do; you were always kind and
forbearing with me, when I little deserved it. But my
poor Elward, it is so hard to part with him, and he
loves me so fondly?'' aud a few natural tears stole don
her cheek.

and then it will be an easy task to make thiem happy us

`Ewarl's loe you will very quickly obtain, if it be

Are the dispositions of your children so unlike?
I slould not have faneiel Ellen cold; she is timid, but

It is not timility; I neer knew her otherwise than

the same towards her ns I did towarls Edward, and

she never seemed een to know when I entered the

shout and laugh only to see me. Now what conduct
on my part could have done tlis? Surely I was justi-
fed in feeling dilerently towards such opposite dispao-
sitions; and I know I never made more difference be-
tween them than-than papa did between nus, Emmeline,
and I have had greater reason to be partial; you were
always better than I was.''
She ceased from exhaustion, but the flush which had
risen to her temples, and te trembling hnnds evinced
the ngitation always called for by the mentian of er
father, which MIrs. Hamilton, with earnest tenderness,
endeaoured to soothe

Edward might do the same by mel'' and, shuddering
iolently, she hid her face on her sister's bosom.
It was long before MIrs. IIamilton could calm that
fearful agitation, long before her whispered words of
heavenly hope, and peaee, and pardon-if indeed shc
belieed-could bring eomfort; but they did at lengtl,

and such fearful paroxysms returned at longer and longer
intervals, and at length ceased, in the deep submission
nand clinging trust to which sle was at last permitted to
attain. Though Irs. IIamilton wus letained six weeks
at langwillan, her deoted attendance on her sister
prevented nnything more than oecasional observation of
the children so soon about to be committed to her care.
That lEdward was most engaging and rieted her affection
at onee, and that Ellen was uulike any child she had
ever known or seen, sle could not but feel, but she was
not one to decide on a mere feeling. Her present
mournful task precntcd all actual interference with
them, except the endenvour by kindly noticc to win
their confilence and lote. IIis mother's illness ad his
uncle's prcsence, besides, for the present, his perfect
freelom with regard to employment, had depried
Edward of all inclination to rebel or exert his self-will,
and Mr. and MIrs. IIamilton both felte tlat le certainly
had fewer fanlts, than was generally the consequence of
unlimited indulgence. Wether Ellen's extreme atten-
tion to her mother, her silent but eycr resdy elp when
her aunt required it, proceeded from merc cold duty, or
really ad its origiu in aflection, MIrs. IIamilton could
not satisfactorily dccide. IIer sister had avowed par-
tiality, but that neglect and unkinduess could have been
shown to such an extent by a mother ns to crente the
cold cxterior she bcleld was so utterly incomprehensiblc,
so opposcd to every dictate of maternal loc, whicl she
knew so well, that she actually could not cvcn imagine
it. She could beliee in the possibility of a prcfercuce

of her senses would in all human probability he followed

Edward, full of glee at being permitted to see her

him, thnt he uttered n lond cry, and throwing himself
besido her, sobbed upon her bosom. MIrs. orteseue

We the broken sentenctes tlat, in n voice scarcely
audible, and at long intervals, esenped MIrs. TFortescue'as
lips, and then her head sunk lower on MIrs. Hamilton's
bosom, and there was a long, long silence, broken only
by Edward's low and half-suffocated sobs. And he
knew not, guesesed not the grief that was impending.
He only felt that his mother as worse, not better, as
he ad belieted would and mnst be when his aunt ar-
rired. He had neser secn death, tlough Ellen had;
nd he had passionately and wilfully refused either ta
listen to or believe in his ncle's and MIr. MIrin's
gentle attempts to prepare him for his lotss. Terrified
at the continued silence, at the cold heasy feel of his
mothcr's hand, as, when MIr. Myrin and the widow
gently remoed er fram the still-supporting arm of
MIrs. Hamiltaon, it fell against his, he starte up, and
clinging to his aunt, implored her to speak to him, to
tell him why his mother looked so strange and white,
her hand felt so cold, and why she would not speak to
and kiss him, as she always did, when he was grieved.
MIrs. IIamilton raised her head from her husband's
shoulder, and strugglihg with her own deep sorrow,
she drew her orphan nephew closer to her, and said, in
n low earnest voice, ` MIy Edward, did you not hear
our mother pray God to bless youl''
The echild looked at her inquiringly.

She cannot speak, my sweet boy the soul which
enablel her to speak, and smile, anl live, was Gol's
gift, and it has pleasel IIim to recull it,''
`And will she never, never speak to me again? ill
she never kiss me-never call me her own darling,

sionate grief, as the truth at length foreel itself pon
him. : MIamma, mamma, my own dear, pretty, good
mamma, ohl do not go away fram me-or let me go with
you-let me die too ; no one will lore me or kiss me as you
have done,'' And een the natural awe and terror of denth
gave way before his grief; he clung to the hody of his
mother so passionately, so convulsively, that it required
actual force to remove him. nd for hours lis aunt
and sister watched orer and tried to soothce and comfort
him in vain; he wonld only rouse himself augrily to ask
Ellen how she could know what he felt; she ha never

her to love and admire him still more, and to beliee
that she relly did not feel as much as he did. And yet
before they quitted Ilangillan, which they did the
second day after MIrs. Fortescue's funeral, Edwnrd could
laugh and talk as usual-except when any object re-
called his mother; and poor Ellen felt that though she
had fancied she was not happy before, she was much
more unhappynow. Her fancy naturally vivid, and ren-
derel more so from her aving been left so much to
herself, dwelt morbidly on all that had passed in hcr
mother's illness, on eery caress, eery unusual word of
affection, and on Mr. MIyrvrin's assurance that she would
love ler in Heaven; the promise she had made to lova
and help Edward returned to her memory again and
agnin, and each time with tle increased etermination
to keep it salemly. It was not for her motler's snke
aulonc, and connceted only with her; perhaps, lad it not
been for the careful instructions of her fnther, whom,
as we shall presently see, she had had cause almost to
idolise, Ellen might have hecome indifferent to her
mother anl envious of Edwarl. But his repeated
instructions, uner all circumstances, to love, chcrish,
nnd ohey hcr mother, had heen indelibly cngraved, and
heighteedl natural feeling. Sho bclieved that to kecp
the promise, which had so cvidently pleased her mother,
wonuld be also obeying her father, and this doubhle
incentive gave it a weight and consequence, which, could
Mrs. IIamilton have known it, would have cnused her
great anxiety, and urged its removal. But lEllen had

she receied, when Arthur explained hat had detainel

relatie whom, if timidity had permittel, she would

Tle noelty of his situation, the rapid and pleassant

Emmeline and Eleanor MIaners were the daughters
of Lord Delmont, a nobleman whose title and rank were
rather burdensome than otherwise, from the want of
uIficient means to keep tlem up as inclination and
position warranted. Lady Delmont, whose energetic
yet gentle charaeter would have greatly amelioratcd tha
petty vexations of her husband, lied when Emmcline
was only seven, kleanor five, and Charles, her only
boy, an infnt of tlec yenrs old. A widow lady,

With Emmeline, though there werc naturally some
faults to correet, an indolence and weakncss to over-

for acquirement, her task was comparatiely easy, for
her pupil had the capabilities, not only of atfection but
of reerence to a ery great extent, and once loviug and
respecting MIrs. llarcaurt, not a command was neg-

oom. IIer power once thus experienced, of course,
was never resigned. IIer father's appearance in their
study was always the signal for her tears, which she
knew would confirm all his ideas of Mrs. IIarcourt's
unjust partiality.
And this idea was strengthened as they grew older,
and masters for arions accmplishments somewhat
lightened Mlrs. Iareourt's acetual labonrs. Emmeline's
steady applicntion and molerate abilities were last sight

thus seeking to curry favour. MIrs. IIarcourt was the
only one from whom he never heard Eleanor's praises,
and the only one, who spoke in praise of Emmeline. It
must then be wilful blindness on her part, and the fatler
felt indignant, but in spite of imself had too much rel
respect for her individually to do more than redouble
his indulgence to Elennor. kEmmeline could not eom-
plain of her father's neglect, for he was both kind and
nffectionate to her; but she did sometimes wish sle
could he quite sure that he loed her as much as her
sister; and her deep affections, nnsuspeetel by her father,
rejected and laughel at by Eleanor, twined themselves
closer and closer round MIrs. IIarcourt, and her brother
Charles, on whom she actunlly doted, and who returned
her atfection with one quite as fond and arm, as a
happy, laughter-loing, frank-hearted boy had it in his
power to bestow; yet even his holidays were times of
as much suffering as joy to his sister, fromn the violent
quarrels hich were continually taking place between
him and Elennor. Emmeline, happy in herself and
MIrs. IIarcourt's companionship, could endure Eleanor's
ctermined supemacy and, except where her conscience
disapproved, yielded to her. lut this could not be
expeeted from Charles, who, despite his elder sister's
gentle entreaties, would stand up for wlat he called her
rights, and declare that when he was at home, Miss
Eleanor should not lord it oer the whole family.

till Chnrles in a dcsperate passion would seek Lmme-
line's ehamber, and his father, though he actually deeply
loved and was very proud of his son, wished that tle
holidays vere over and Charles safe again at school.
Trifling as domestic disputes may seem in description,
they never fail in their painful reality to banish all
lasting happiness, Emmeline could bear that her father
should prefer Elennor to lerself, but that he should be
njust to her darling Charles, and that Charles should
increase this evil by ispute and self-will, tried hen
severely, and obliged her often and often to fly to the
solitude ofhcr own chanber, lest her temper also should
fail, and to defend her brother, she should forgct hen
duty to her fater. lut with er MIrs. IIareonrt'a
lessons had indeed been hlessed. The spirit of true
heartfclt picty, which she had sought to instil into her
youthful charge, een more by the examples of her daily
lite than by precepts, had become Emmeline's, young
ns she still was, and enahled her not only to bear up
against the constant pctty anoyances of her honc, but
the heavy trial sustained in the death of Mrs. IlIarcourt,
just as she was looking forward to her entrance in the
gay world, uner her matermnal guardianship, nnd her
parting with her brother, who not two months after-
wards left loer to fulfil his arling wish of going to sca.
At eighteen, then, lEmmeline Mlanrers became the mis-
tress of her fathier's establislicnt, and had to enconter
aloue, not nly the suffering of bereuvemeut-in which,

labours. Lor Delmont was not astonished and delighted
onl, a feeling of respect towards his gentle, his truthtul
child entered his heart, such as he had espericnced
towards none, sae her mother. Emmeline would indeed
have thought nll her toils repaid, could she hae known
this, but the very feeling prevented the display of that
earessing afflection he still lavishel on Eleanor, and the
tears of his elder girl often fell thick and fast from the
painful longing for one similar caress, one eidencc on
his part, that, though neither so beautiful, nor talented,
nor engaging as Eleanor, she could yet minister to his
comfort and increase his happuess.
ut Emmeline's strong feeling of religion, lile it
enabled her to bear up against ceare and the constant
nd most pninful feeling of loneliness, rendered the
trial of beholding her siaster's wilful course of error, if
mpossible, still more severe. She knew that all her afiec-

Lascelles and Eleanor's passionate entrcaties had pre-
railel on Lord Delmout to permit his daughter heing
more witli hcr than with her sister and governess.
Lady Lascelles was a woman of the world, utterly
heartless, higly distinguished, and supremely fashion-
able. At her house all tle ton of the heau monde
congregated, and scandal, frivolity, and esprit were the
prevailing topics, diversified with superficial opinions
of the literature, arts, and politics of the day, and
arious sentimental episodes, which the lady of the
house endured for the sake of variety. IIere Elceanor,
even at founrteen, was male a popular idol; er cextreme
beauty, hcr iacity, hcr talents, her sharpness of
repartee, all were almired, extollel, and encouraged.
At seventcen she was introducel and initiated into all
the mysterics of an ultra-fashionalle life, and very
speedily addet to her other accomplishments-all the
arts of a finisledl and heartless coquette.
With Lady lLascelles for hcr chaperon, it was not
very surprising that Emmeline MIaners shrunk in pain
and rcal from her introduction into socicty; but yet
she knew her social duties too well to refuse, and, by
an affectation of supcrior sanctity, which of course
would hase heen the ceharge leelled nagainst her, throw
a aneer upon those holy feelings and spiritual princi-
ples which had become part of her very being. She
entered into society, but the isolation to a heart like
hers of the coteries of Lady Lascelles anl her friends,
was inleel most painful, and aggrarated by the constant
ldreal which the contempltion af Eleanor's recklese
career could not but occasion.

clusive thnn the assemblages of ILady ILscelles, the
nttention of botl sisters was attracted to a young an,
by name Arthur Hlamilton-Eleanor, from his distin-
guished appearance and extreme reserre, Emmeline, by
the story attached to his name. IIis father had so
istinguishel himself in the amelioration of the pea-
santry and working classes in various parts of England,
in addition to arious serices of a private and confi-
dential nature from the home goernment to the
courts abroad, that a viscountcy was offered to his
aceceptance. The message from roalty reached him on
his death-bed, nnd though, from the faint anl flickering
accents with which he replied to the intended honour,
it seemcd as if he leclined it, it was attributed to the
natural feelings of a dying man, seeing the utter
nothingness of earthly honours, and the title was gene-
rously proposel to his son. But Arthur Iamilton had
not been the pupil and friend of his father in vain.
With a ealm dignity and uneompromising independence,
he declared that he had neither claim nor heirship to
the reward of his fatler's services; that he helievedl his
parent would himself have refusel it, preferring the
honorable distinction of heing an untitled English gen-
tleman, to tle unalued honour of a newly-crented
lordship. He respectfully thanked the gorernment
for the honour they intended, bUut decisively refused it-

ELEANO's unfounded dislike taowards Arthur IIamil-
ton did not decrense when he became er brother-in-
law; she chose to believe that he had injured her by
being the only one who had remained proof against all
the fascinations she had thrown in his way. Een in
her childhood, if any one chanced to notice Emmeline
more thn herself it was considered a martal offence,
and the person who had so offended was scarcely spoken
to agin. Tlerefoe that Emmeline should he mnrriel

failel to fascinate, she equally failed to offend. IIe

always all to her, and if she i think that thcy might
one day be under his charge, she little imagined the
unhappiness and mischief which their supposition of
is unbending sternness might engender.
T6 kEmmeline, the change in her young life was so
marellous, so complete- care, anxiety, loneliness, that
sinking of the whole frame and heart, from the absenee
of appreciation and social kindness, had so departed,
lenving in their stead such an intensity of quiet domes-
tic happiness, that it was long hefore her full heart
eonld believe it reality, and rest secure. She had always
longed for one to reverence, to cling to, and her husband
gave her room for both. As his hetrothcd, eten hefore
thcir marriage, she had been introduced to very different
asociety to that of the MIarchioness; she heheld him
reverenced, loved, appeuled to by the wisest and the
best men, often older than himself. That this man
shiould so love, cherish, and actually reverence her, no
wonder that under the magic of snch feelings her cha-
raeter matured, displaing snch engaging anl nnsus-

with ElIcanor, which eonduct threw her still more with
Lndy Lascelles. As to joining society with MIr. and
Mlrs. Hamilton, when they were in Lonlon, Elennor
would not hear of it. But to her sister's great joy uand
some surprise, she aecepted an invitation to Oakwood,
a short time after little Perey's birth, and, still more
surprising, condescendel to make herself agreeable.
The Lonon season had tired her, and she thought she
might just as well be ull on the banks of the Dart in
August and September as in some stupid watering-place.
MIr. IIamilton, espite her dislike, which she cared not
to avo, she fonnl could be at least very entertaining;
her fthor was more likce his former self, her sister far
more delightful and lovely than she eer thought se

lIer visit to her father in London in the winter re-
moved all their rising hopes, nnd caused sucl increased
and intense anxiety, as so to injure her alrendy delicate
health thiat her husband hore her back to Oakwood a
fll month before they had originally intended.-
Wether or not Eleanor loed Lord Fitzeclair, it was
impossible to determine; but thate deotcdly, passion-
ately loved her, was only too evident, not only to the
worll hnt to herself, and this once confirmed, she left
o method untriel to torment, and so, as she eclarel
it, try if his aifections ere orth hasing. He was
alf an Italian, and hd inherited all tle strong, fierce
passions of that country, witlout oe atom of selt-con-
trol. Mr. Hamilton knew him ell, far better thnn
he knew himself, and conjured hi to withdrnw from
the society of one who could never make him happy,
and shose capricious conduct was so likels to euder
him desperate and miserable: he rensoued, ctreted in
vain. `She only wants to try the stregth of my
lore,'' was his sole reply; '`and were she to torment
health and life aw, it will neverchange;-she will be
mine yet.''
And to the asstonishment of Mr. and MHrs. Hamilton,
two months afterwards he proposed in form, and actu-
ally ws accepted, with the sole condition that their
engagement should he kept secret till it should please
Eleanor to name the weddiug day, which could not bc

in Cheltenham wvith a ery gay party, in vhich Eleanor
was still of course the star. MIrs. IIamilton entcred the
nursery one morning earlier thn usual, for her infant
had not been well the night before, and she had already
expeieneed the care as well as the joy of a mother. IIer
babe was better, and as he lay smilingly and happily in
ler lap, and watched the eager mosements ot his
hrother, she was only sensible of pleasure. The nurse
had arranged the chairs in a long line, that MIaster
Perey might, with their help, walk the whole length of
the large and airy room. The feat mightily plesed
the little gentleman, who having acquired the venerablc
age of fifteen months, liked better to feel his feet than
crawl on the floor, or be cnrricd about on any limbs but
his own. kEvery two or three paces he stood nearly
alone, and burst into a loud merry laugh, which was
alwaya echoel by a crow of joy from his little brotler.
 Take care, Percy, love, don't fall and frighten
mamma,'' said his young mother, who was watching
him ith such pleasure as to scnd for his father to
share it. Wen her son, to prove how well le obeyed
her commands to take cnre, stood for a second without
hy sppart, nnd then ran quite alone across the room,
and with a yet louder laugl hid his rosy face in her
lap. Mrs. IInmilton fondly kissel the little nestling
head, anl nt that momcnt ler hushand enteredl the

The child lookel up in her face, and then, as is
father held out his arms to him, let go his mother's
lress, and obeyed hecr. MIr. Hamilton caught him ta
his heart, held him for aboe a minute, kissed him
fondly, and left the nursery withoute uttering a single
word.
 Let me take Master Herbert, ma'am,'' said the
head nurse respectfully, for she saw that her mistress's
uexpressed alarm had nearly overpowered ler; and in
a few minutes Emmeline was with her hasband, whose
agitation was so excessise, that een his wife's presence
for tle moment ad scarcely power to calm him.
The tale was soon told. Elennor's conduct since her
eogagemcnt had been such as to excite the displeasure,
not of her father alone, but actually of the Marchioness;
who, though a weak and worldlly woman, had yet some
ien of propricty. As a near relation of Lord Delmont,
Eleanor's engagcment with Lorl Fitzelir was of course
told to her, and again and again she warned her that
she was geing too far, and might lose her loer before
she was aware of it; but kleanor only laughed at her,
and at last won her oer to the belief that it was cer-
tainly better to cure Fitzclair of his jealous tendency
lefore marriage than afterwards. Lord bDelmont's re-
proofs she was wont to silenee, by inariably making
them the sigal of mortifying and annoying Lord
Fitzclair still more than usual. Yet still at times she

relentel, and so strengthened the love she had excited,
so enhanced her own fascinations, that all the agony he
had endured anl was still, he knew, to endure, by an
incomprehensible contraliction, rieted her power and
hastened his own doom. WVealk in all things but his
lore, he could not demand as his actual right the pub-
lication of their engagement. Eleanor owed if he did,
till she permitted him, she would hae uothing more to
say to him. She knew, though she did not say it,
that once made kown, a chain would be tlown round
her actions, which she did not choose to cndure. And
father, loer, and friend, all feeling she was wrong, and
the first and lasst repetedly tclling her so, had yet
neither of them the resolution to contend with her, and
compel the proper course.
A month of thcir visit to Cheltenham so passed, when
Eleanor's attention was arrested by a new actor ou the
scene. She had begun to tire of her present satellites,
and a yog military captain, wose furlough from
Inlia had just exspired, and whose pale face, omewlat

anew evecry jculous feeling. It wns casy for Cnptnin
Fortescue to diseover Fitzclair as his rival; but be-
lieving himself decidedly tle objcct of Elcnuor's pre-
fercnee, he inereasel his atteutions, little imagining the
storm he was cxciting, tle more feful from its deter-
mined suppression. Lorl Delmont interfered several

mined coldness to hernew suitor. Finding at length that
her encouragement actually neared a criminal extent, and
after a desperately stormy interview, he solemnly de-
clared that if she did not dismiss Captain Tortescue at
once, he would shame her in the face of te whole
world, by proclaiming her engagement with the young
Marquis. Eleanor in equal anger declared that if he
threatened, so too could she, anl if he tormented her
any more she would preent all publication of her en-
gagement, by herself snapping it asunder, and plelging
her faith to Captain Forteseue. This was too much
een for Lord Delmont. Declaring if she did so, a
father's heaviest mnlediction should fall on her head,
e hastily left er; and Eleanor very composedly
went to prepare for an excursion on horseback with
Fortescue, Fitzclair, and others.
When Lord Delmont's passions were once roused,
een his ordinnrily slender judgment entirely forsook
him, and he did that which at another time, kowing
Fitzelair as e did, e would hae shrunke from. IHe
sought him wlile still exasperated, upbrnided him for
his weukness in permitting kEleanor's unprincipled con-
duct, and warned him that, if he id not adapt some
strong measures to prevent it, he would certainly lose
her entirely.
The oung man heard him without reply; but his
face grew livid, and he elenched his hand till the blood
started from the nails, and in this mool of concentrated
passion joined the riding arty. Thie exercise itself is
to some temperaments uuusually exciting, and the de-
termined coldness of Eleanor to himself, and the
eagerly-reecired deation of Fortescue, maddenc him.

finally, reproached. Eleanor, already irritatel; and be-
yonl all that her lover, in general so obsequious and
humhle, should lare to call her to account, for mere
amusement, combined with the recollection of Captain
Fortescue's flattering ows and willing homnge; exscited
her to an extent of which she as herself unconscious,
inasmuch as she firmly belieted, ' whateer she might
say then, a few soft words would speedily obliterate.
She told him that really his jealous temperament wae
beyond all endurance; that he certainly must intend
her to despise and abhor him; and that the contrast ho
prcsented to Captain Fortescue was such as to make her
most heartily wish to put an end to their engagemcnt,
as she felt quite sure it must only end in miscry for
both; and, without waiting for a reply, she augltily
hrushel by him and disappeared.
Of the extent of Fitclir's passion Eleanor had not
the least idea, and this is saying a great deal, for she
generally exaggerated her own power. She helieved
she had inflicted pain, but not as much as he deserved;
and determined that she would torment him et more
at the ball that evenig. But to her extreme mortifi-
ecatian he did not appcnr, and there was n vague dread
on her spirits as she retirel for the night, which pre-
vented anything like rest. lIis absence hd excitod
surprise in all, especially Lady Lascelles, who knew
that to lcate Eleanor entirely to the attentions of young
Fortescuc was so unpeccdented us to bode no good.
But the wildest eonjeetures were far from reality. Te

53
moast painful excitement by the incomprehensible and
most extraordinary fact of the suicide of Lord Fitzelair;
by what oceasioned, plunged into such mystery that
othing but sudden aberration of mind was imagined,
a bclief justified by the very peculiar temperament and
manners of the young nobleman during his sojourn with
them. IIis will, a valuable present, with a few lines of
regard to his faithful attendnnt, and a letter addressed
to Arthur Hamilton, Esq., were the sole evidences that
the awful deed had not been committel without some
preparation; but ns that was often the cuse with mad-
ess itself, it excited no remark.
The state of Eleanor's mind when these awful tidings
were communicated to her, which they wcerc by her
fathcr, in his agitation and anger, without the least
preparation, we lene our readers to imagine. Har-
dened, heartless, wilful as she was, she was still a
woman, and a ery young ohe, and till Captain
Fortescue appeared, had loved, as far ans it was in her
nature, Lord Fitzclair. To bheliese that she had nothing
to do with his miserabhle end was an attempt so rain
and hollo, that een she shrunk from the hopeless
struggle to realize it; remorse in all its torturing, unmi-
tigated anguish took possession of her, but instead of
leading her to penitenee, and thence the hope of peacee,
it urged her to a course of action from which she
imagined there was no withdrawing, and which must
in time, by remoing her from all painful associations,
lessen her present misery.
For three days aud nights she never quittel her own
apartment, and tlen joined her usual circles witlout

still hors. It was ery easy to displace paleness by ar-
tificial roses, and her gay smiles and joyous sallies were
tempered only by a judiciously-expressed horor when
the late eent was discussed before her, supposed natural
to one who had known him so intimately; but the
hours of loneliness which followed this conduct in
society were terrible indeed. lBy a strange contrariety
of fceling, er better nature longed for Emmeline,
and her artificial, which had, alasl only too forcibly
beeome her natural self, felt as if she woul leae the
kingdom rather than encounter the mil, sorrowful
glance of those penetrating eyes.
Lord Delmont was imself in a most pitiable con-
dition; even minor evils had always been great to him,
and the effect of this, the wish to take Eleanor away
from Captain Fortescue's increased and annoying atten-
tions, and yet the dread that doing so would conneet
er vwith Fitzclair's death, so listracted him as to renler
him reslly ill-informstion which instantly brought MIr
nnd MIrs. IHmilton to Cleltenham.
fSome yotng wies and mothers might hase felt it
hrd that their domestie enjoyment should so continu-
nlly hae becn isturbcd and annoyed from the faults
of others; but Emmeline hal hcen accustomed to trace
everything that created personal snllering to the highest
souree, and fceol that it was good for ler, or it wonld
ot be; a coniction that enabled her to ear witl and

feelings of the morning. A sensation of intense le-
pression crept over Emmeline as she gazed, incrensing
as she looked on the faee of the sleeper, which, divested
of its unnatural bloom, lookel so fearfully wan aud
haggard. Her beautiful hair lay in tangled masses on
her damp brow, and as Emmeline gently tried to re-
move it, Eleanor started and awoke.
 Is it alrendy time to get up?'' she said, languidly,
and only half unelosing her eyes; I feel as if I had

sense of guilt and pain; she tried to be cold, proud, re-
serrel, but it would not do, and she suddenly flung her
arms round her sister's neck, and burst into agonized
tears.
It was a most unerpectetd greeting, and MIrs. IIamilton
argued hopefully from it. Alas. the unwonted softening
only lasted one brief hlf hour. She left her at

Emmeline coull not suceeed in convincing her how

persist that she was not in the least to blame, and that
poor Fitzclair's fearful end was only owing to his own
violent passions, in faet, that he must hare been out of
his mind, and that, though it was certainly ery dread-
ful, she had perhaps escped a very terrible doom; but
speak as she might, Emmeline was not leceiel as to
the agony she was actually enluring. TFinling, hoveer,

from fainting. fShe desistel; hoping against hope that
Eleanor would yet repent and becomc a dillerent being.
She knew harshess woull only harlen, and so she

youth. Weak characters, also, when drien to anger,

Eleanor's continued haughtiness and coldness, as if she
were the injured one, did not tend to calm him.

And his augry feelings were unfortunately but too
soon aggravatcd by a proposal in form from Captain
Fortescue for the hand of Eleanor. ithout a mo-
ment's delay, he despatchel a decided and almost
insulting refusl to the young soldier, and tlen sought
his dnughter, and vented on her the anger and vex-
ation which oerpowered him, upbraiding her not only
with the death of Fitzclair, but for haing dared so to
encourage young Fortescue as to gise him courage
for his audacious proposal. To his astonishment,
he was heard without any attempt at reply; but he
would hae heen startled, could he have seen the pallid
chceek, compressed lip, and clenched hand with which,

Agony of breaking anotler loring heart.''
Nearly three weeks rolled on, and Eleanor's ex-
traordinary suhmission, and even in some egree
withlrawal from society (for which MIrs. Hamilton's
arrival was a good excuse), caused her father's irritation
against her almost entirely to snbside. That she
passed seeral hours each day apart from her sistez
excited no surprise. Emmeline was thankful even for
her change of deportment, but nothing confidential

eighed on MIrs. IIamilton's spirits, as Elcanor care-
lessly threw it to her for her perusal, but she would
not express it, as Lord Delmont seemed inclined that
Eleanor slould aceept it, knoving that the laly was
much too exclusie for Captain Fortescue to join hen

ference to the visit originnted from that cause. Telling
her, he was so gratifiel by her having devoted so many

Tlough Eleanor had been his faorite, his feelinge

nancy, and excite ecry gratifying emotion, not only in his

naturally increased, strong as it always had heen, even
in childhool,--and the visits which Charles had been
enablel to make to Oakwood, brief in duration as they
were compelled to be, had always bccn fraught with
heartfelt joous happiness, not only to herself but to her
husband. Tle pain and anxiety attendant on Elennor's

ful slavery which the bombardment of Algiers had so
displayed to lEuropean eycs-wuas the portion of all those
bheloved ones, for whom so many aehing hearts and eyes
ha watched and wept in vain. It was a trial so terrible,
that MIrs. Hamilton felt at first as ifeven submission hnd
departed from her; and she could almost hnve rebelled
in spirit agaiust the inscrutable lecree, that had con-
signed one so free from ice and eil, so full of happiness
and worth, to a doom so terrible. MIuch as she had
loed and reerenced her husband beforce, she seemed
neer to have felt lis worth and tenderness till then.

prayer was eer rising for guidanee, and gratitude, that

knew, as a single woman, as her sole source of inde-

Hareourt found, inleel, the friend her aching spiri

repose which she had insisted should forestall the com-
mencement of exertion ere arer, rejoiced in te ceon
viction that the danghter of her beloved anl regretted
friend was indeed well-fitted for that position in her
family, her helper in the moral and intellectual training
of lcr dasughters, which her iid faney had often pic-
turcd as so filled. They were indeed hut infants when
Miss Harcourt arrived; but Mr. and MIrs. IIamilton
found means to overrule the honorable scruples which,
on the part of Lucy, seemed at first against their plan,

But as his health, always delicate, became more and

the quiet pleasures of lomestic life, he found, and
bitter was that first awakening, that his wishes, hie

that it would be cruel indeed to chain such a being
to his side, and sometimes mke the exertion (for
which he was little fitted) to acecompauy her; at others,
with kind words and indulgent loe, permit her ta
follow her own wishes, and remain alone. But little
id he think the real reason that Elcanor could not rest
in quiet at home. The recollection of Lord itzelasir
was at such times s fearfully vivid, that the very agey
she had endure when first told of his fearful end
would return in all its intensity; the thought, had
her fater really cursed her for ler disobedicnce, and
was it that for ever hoering round her, preventing
auything like lasting happiness. And yet, by a strange
contradiction, while the idea of her fatler's curse
shookc her wlole frme at times with convrulsie
sobs, pride, that most fatal ingredient of her cha-
raete, utterly preented all attempt on her part to

had made no effort to conciliate, she would not;

In ain did the Colonel, when he became awnre of
this treatment, remonstrate that it as the illness of
the poor child,-neither obstinacy nor ill-temper: his
wife would not understand him, and at length he
sternly and peremptorily declared, that as she had her
will with Bdward, he wold hse his with Ellen, and
that no cehastisement should be inflictel. If she id
wTong, he was to be told of it, and if necessary he
would rcproe her, but he would allow no other in-

Only too quiekly did the poor child discoer that

That tho child harself could not hasve dehned these

even before she was nine years old, and that they
influencel many years of her after-life, causing error

one of pain and difficulty, before these mistaken in-
fluences could be eradicated, is equally so. The power

DUIESTIC DISCoD AND ITS END,

Tn1E displeasure of her husband, his reproacehes for
her conduct to Ellen, by causing seme degree of unnoy
ance, increased Mrs. Fortescue's feelings of dislike
towards the object who had cused it, and this was
soon afterwards heightened hy self-reproach.
A malignant feer broke out in the British settlement
where Colonel Fortescue was stationed, lis wife and
children were ith him, and, readfully alarmed,
Eleanor etermined to remove witl her children to some
less unhealthy spot. The Colonel willingly consented;
but before their hasty preparations ere cncluded
Ellen sickened. Alarm for Edward, hoeser, so en-
grossed the mother, that she appeared incapahle of any
other thought. In ain Colonel lFortescue rged that
his son would be seafe witl the frienls who had pro-
mised to take charge of him, nnd who were on the
point of lenving the city. That there were none on
whom he could depend so to tend tle little sufferer
as not to require a guiding head, and she knew how
impossible it was for him to be with his child as his
heart promptel. He urged, cntreated, commanded in
vain, MIrs. Fortescue was inexorable. She deelared that

would lrie her mad; and as for uty, one ehild e-
nandcl her care as much as another. That her hus-
band might not cre abont thus exposing her to infec-
tion, but she really thought, for ldwarl's sake, it was
her dnty to take care of herself. It might be nothing
to the Colonel or Ellen whether sle lired or dicl, but
to Elward it was a great deal; and so as shc must
choose betwveen them, she would go with him wlo loved
her best, and who would be miserable without hcr. The
haughty angry tone ith which she spoke, the unjust
taunt, roused every indignant feeling, and Colonel
Forteseue said more in that moment of irritatiaon than
he could have helieved possible. But it only awakened
the cold sustaining pride which Eleanor always callel
to hee aid wlen conscience sote her, and she departed
with her son, hardening every better fecling and
rousing anger ngainst her husband and child to con-
quer the suffering of self-reproach. ut when many
miles from the city of death, anl there were no fears
for lldward, anxiety and wretchedness so assailel her,
that pride itself gave way. To communicnte with the
infected city was lifficult, ud very infrequent, and
ngain and again lidl she wish that she had remainel.
bDuring the eontinuance of Ellen's illness her father's
anguish was indeed terrible. Every leisure moment
he spent by her side, moistening her parched lips,
bathing hcr buruing forehead, nd listening to thc
plaintive aeeents of delirim with an acuteness of
suffering, that injured his own health more than he
had the lcast idea of. Th attendanuts were really

he was ot witl her, she was neglectei and in still

nnd his child was almost more than he could bear.
He had neer been a religious man-never known
wlat it was to pray, except in the public serrices of
his regimet, but now prayer, earnest, heartfelt,
poured from him, and the thankfulness to God, which
so oerpawered him, when she was pronounced out
of ange, as to compel him to weep like n chill,
planted a sense of a Fater's infinite loe and infinite
compassion within him, which was his sole sustainer
the short remainder of his life.
Eleanor's letters, few as they were, had in some
degree softened his anger towards her; but as he
beleld the raages of disease on his poor child's face
and form, rendering her still less attractire than she
hal bcen, and perceived that bodily weakcss had
extended to her mind, and often and often forcel tears
Irom her cycs and momentary complainings, he trem-
bled lest Eleanor should find still more to dislike and
reproe; an often his heart blel as Ellen ould ask
with tcars, for her desr mamma, adding, plaintivcl,-
Mammna necr isses me or loes mce as she dccs
Edarl; but I like to be near her, and look at hcr
dear beautiful face, and wish I was good and pretty
enough for her to love me. Why does she never come
to me l-and why may I not go to he ?''
And wlat could the Colonel reply, except that her
mother fenred Ewnrd would take the infection, and
therefore she was obliged to go with him to somc placte
of snfety ? And his child was satisfied, regeting a
fondly her elight that her dear, dear Edwarl had

father clasped her closer and closer to his heart, feeling
the intrinsic beauty of a disposition that, instead of
repining that she was left alone to suffer, coull rejoice
that her brother had been spared.
Colonel kortescue obtained a few weeks' leave, that
he might take his child to the sea-side as recommended,
ere she joined her mother. And alone with him,
graually regaining a moderate degree of strength,
Ellen was very happy; but such briglt interals were
indeel few and far between. There was no change
in her mother's contduet towards er, when reunited.
ller heart had, indeed, risen to her lips as she again
heheld the clild so nearly lost; nnd had she fallowel
impulse, she would hae clasped her in her arms and
ept oer hetr, but that vould have seemed tacitly
to acknowledge that she had heen wrong, al had
suffered from it; and so she refrained, causing suffer-
ing to herself, anguish to her child, and pain to her
husband, all from thst fell demon pride. She only
chose to remember that it was Ellcen who had been the
cause of her husbanl's anger-Ellcn, the constant
subject of ceontention between them-Ellen, alwnye
causiug the pang of self-reproch: and so how as
it possible tlat she could loe her?
About a yenr after Ellen's dangerons illness, when
she was early ten, and Edward just eleven, Colonel
Iortescue was ordered to take the commnnd of some
troops to be stationed at a fort, whose vicinity to some
hostile atives rendercd it rather a post of langcr

in their choice. The Colonel was strangely and pain-
fully depressed as with some vague dread, and all his
affiection for his wifte had returned with such force as
to make him shrink in unusual suffering from the idca
of leaing her; and conquering reluctanee, for he felt
us if she would not acccde, he implored her to accom-
pany him, confessing he felt ill and anhappy, and
shrank from a separation. His wife looked at him
with astonishment; he had never asked nor thought
of such a thing before, she said, in thcir many brief
partings, anl she really could not understand him.
e place was decidedly unhealthg, and Edward must
not be exposed to its malaria; besides which, she had
promised him to go to a juenile ball, which was gireun
by an English family of rank in a fortnight's time,
and she could not possibly disappoint him; aul why
her husband should wish for he in such a place sle
could not imagine, but she knew she should die of

`Lct me go with you, Papa, dear Papal ohl I will
be so good-I will not gire you any trouble, indeed,

ear Ppa?'' And she looked in his faee so beseech-
ingly, that the Colonel had no strength to resist, and
fondly kissing her, le promised that if MIrs. Cumeron
would permit her to join her little family, she should
go with him: and, to Ellen's intense thankfulness, the
permission ws willingly aeeordel.
MIrs. Fortescue had indeed replied, when her husband
briefly imparted his intention, that he eertainly must
intend Ellen to be ill again, by erposing er to sueh
an unhealthy climate; and that if sle were, he must
not be angry if she refused to go and nurse her, as it
would he all his weak indulgece, and no fault of hers.
The Colonel made no answer, and irritated beyond
measure at his manner, Eleanor parted fom he
husband in coldness and in pride.
The fortnight passed, and MIrs. Forteseue felt as if
her own youth were indeed renewed, the longings for
niersal admiration again her own; but now it was
only for her son, and her triumph was complete; many
nnd lovely were the yonthful hcings oalled together on
that festive night, sceming as if England ad concen-
trated her fairest and purest ofspring in that far
distant land; but Edward, and his still loely motler,

 to somemighty dead. Anl if it were indeed but excited
faney, it had a strange effect, for Eleanor fainted on the
marble floor.
That same afternoon Colonel Forteseue, with some
picked men, hal set off to discover the traek of some
marauding natives, who for some days had becn ob-
sered hovering about the neighbourhoo. Military
ardlour carriel him farther thn he intended, and it
was nearly night, when entering a narrow defile, a
large boly of the enemy burst upon them, and a des-
perate contcst ensued. The lefile was so hemmed in
with rock and mountain, that though not ery distant
from the fort, the noise of the cengagement had ot
been diatinguishel. Captain Cameron was quietly sitting
with lis wife and elder children, awaiting witlout nny
Iorebodings the return of tlo Colonel. Though it was
late, Ellen's fecars had been so visible, that MIrs. Cameron
could not send her to bed; tle clild seemed so rest-
lcss nnd uneasy that the Captain had tricl to lugh her
out of lcr cowardice, as he callel it, declaring that her
father would disown her if slc coul not be more brare.
Hasty footsteps were at length herd appronching, and

Forteseue hadl stood transfixed by some unkown terror,

It was long before Lllen rallied from that terible
scene. Even hen the fever wlich followed subsided,
and she had been taken, apparently perfectly restorel
to health, oce more to her mothcr and brother, its
recollection so haunted her, that her many lonely hours
became fraught with iutense suffering. Her imagination,
already only too morbid, dwelt again and again upon
the minutest particular of that field of horror: not only
her father, but the objects which, when hcr whole heart
was wrapped in him, sle seemed not even to have seen.
The ghastly eaps of dead, the severel limbs, tue mangled
trunks, the gleaming faces all fixed in the distorted
expressions with which they died-the very hollow
groans anl louder cry of pain which, as she passed
through the field, had fallen on her ear unheeel,
returned to the poor child's too carly awakened fancy so
vividly, that often and often it was only a powerful thougl
almost unconscious effort that prevented the sceream
of fear. Her father's last words were uever forgotten;
she wouldnot only continue to love her mnther because
he hal desirel her to do so, but because Ie had so loved

than ever to accomplish. MIrs. Fortescue, torturel by

passage for England some weeks before her meical
nttendant thougt it aisable. The constant struggle
bcteen the whisperiugs of good and the dominion of
evil, wlich her whole life had been, had uneonsciously
uudermined a constitution naturally good; and when to
this was added a malignant disease, tlough hrief in
itself, the seeds of a mortal complaint were planted,
which, ere the long oyage was concluded, had obtained
fatal and irremediable ascendeney, and oceasioned those
sufferings and death which in our first chapters we
deserihed.
To Eward, though the death of his father had caused
im mueh childish griet, still more perhaps fom sym-
pathy with the deep suffering of his mother, than a
perfect consciousness of his on heavy loss, the manner
in which he dicd was to him a source of actual pride.

and naval, and gloried in the idea that his fater ad

fighting against superior numbers, and in the moment
of a glorious ictor. IIe had never seen denth, and
imagined not all the attendant horrors of suchs one;
and how that Ellen eould never eren hear the word
without shuddcring he could not understand, nor why
she slould alwuays so painfully shrink from the remotest
reference to that night, which was only associated in
his mind with emotions of pleasure. In the tedions

ago the oyage from India to England was not what it

and win for him tho regard of passegers and crew.
Captain Camcron had impressed on his mind that he
now stood in his father's place to his mother and sister;
and as the idea of protecting is always a strong incentie
to manliness in a boy, however youthful, Edward well
redeemed the eharge, so devoting himself not only to hise
mother, but to Ellen, that her affection for him redoubled,
as did her mistaken ilea of his ast superiority.
IIis taste had always pointed to the nal in pre-
ference to the military profession, an the voyage con-
firmed it. Before he had been a month on board he
had become practically an expert sailor-had learnel
nll the teehnical names of the arious parts of a ship,
and evinced the most eager dcsire for the acquirement
of navigation. Nor did he fail in the true sailor spirit,
wlen, almost within sight of England, a tremendous
storm arose, rcducing the essel almost to a wreck,
earrying her far from her destined moorings, and
compelling her, after ten days' louht whether or not

TE curtains were drawn close, the large lamp was
on te table, and a cheerful fire blazing in the grate;
for though only September, the room was sufficiently
large, and the eenings sulciently chill, for a fire
to add greatly to its aspect of true English comfort.
There were many admirable pictures suspendel on the
walls, and well-lillel bookcases, esks, and maps, stands
of heautiful flowers, and some ingenious toys, all
seeming to proclaim the apartment as the especial
possession of the yong party who were this eening

and some most alarming-sized dictionaries, which oe-

of the elder girl, the dissected map before her ister,
nnd two or three books scattered round the ounger
boy, the table seemed so well filled, that Miss Harcourt
had quietly ensconced herself in her own private little
corner, suficiently near to take an interest, and some-
times join in the conversation of her youthful charge:

she certainly might have told her sister, with some
show of justice, that there was such an equal distrihu-
tion of interesting and animated cxpression (which is the
great heauty of youth), that she could not have known
the trial of having such a heavy, dull, nnhappy child
as Ellen. MIrs. IIamilton indeel, wse rather tlink would
not hase considered such a trial, except as it proed
ill-health, aud physical pain in the little suferer; and,
pcrhaps, her increased care and tenderness (for sueh
with her would hae been the consequence of the
same cause which had created her sister's neglcct)
might hae removed both the epression of eonstant
but imalpable illness, and the expression of heaviness
and gloom. Certain it is, her own IHerbert had, with
regard to lelicate health, given her more real and con-
stant anxiety than Eleanor had eer allowed herself to
expericnee with Ellen; hut there was nathing in the
boy's peculiarly interesting countenance to denote thc
phgsical suffering he ery often endured. Cnre anl

inducing a habitude of rellection and studious thought
much bcyond his years, or whether thc unusually gifted
mind worked on thic frame, or the one corbined to tform
the other, it wonld be as impossible to decide with
regard to him as with hundrels of others like him;
but he certainly seemed, uot only to his parents, but

casually associated with him, to hae more in him
of eaven than erth; as if, indeed, he were only lent,
not given. And often, and often his mother's hcart
ached with its very intensity of loe, cansing the
unspoken dread-how might she hope to retain one
so faultless, and yet so full of eery human sympathy
and loel The delicate complexion, beautiful colour
of his cheeks and lips, and large, soft, ery lark
blue eye, with its long black lash, high archel brow,
shaded by glossy cheanut hair, were all so lit up wvith
the rays of mind, that though his face rcturned again
and again to the fancy of those who had only once
belheld it, they could scarcely have recalled a single
feature, feeling only the almost angelic cxpression of
the whole.
His brother, as full of mirth and mischief, and as
noisy and laughter-loving as Herbert was quiet and
thongltful, made his way at once, winning regar by
storm, and retaining it by his frank and generous
qualities, which made him as favorite with young and
old. Een in his hours of study, tlcre was not the
least eviencee of refleetion or soberness. As a child
he had had much to contend with, in the way of pas-
sion, pride, and self-will; but his home influence hat
been such a judicious blending of indulgence and firm-
ness on the part of both his parents, snch a persevering
inculcation of a strong asense of duty, religious and
moral, that at fifteen his difficulties had been all nearly
orercome; and except when occasional acts of thought-
lessness aud hasty impnlse lured im into error and
its painful consequences, he was as happy and as good
a lad as ecn his anxious mother coul desire

The elder of his two sisters resembled him in the

the rich dark brown hair, and ell-formed mouth;

it was often difficult to trace the likcness that aetually
exsisted. IIaugltiness, and but too often ill-temper,

and animated was not only attractive then, but gae
fair promise of great bcanty in after years. Te lis-
position of Caroline Hamilton was in fact naturally
so similar to that of her aunt MIrs. Fortescue, that
Mrs. Hamnilton's task with her was not only more
lifficult and painful in the present, than with any of
the otlers, but her dread of the future, at times so
orerpowering that it required all her husband's influence
to ecalm her, by returning trust in Him, who had pro-
mised to anwer all vho called upon Ilim, and vould
bless that mother's toils which were based on, and
looked up alone, to Ilis influenece on her child, and

The hlue-eyed, fair-haired, graceful, littlce Emmeline,
ot only the oungest of the family, but, from her slight
figure, delicate small features, and childish manner,
appearing een much younger than sle was, was indeed
a source of joy and love to all, sceeming ns if sorrow,

the unrestrained expressions of affection, with which
by every one of the young prty they were received,
would have evinced it still more clearly. IIerbert was

least, assumed her still nresigned privilege, as the
yeungest and tiniest, to quietly slip in her lap; Percy
was talking to his fater, making Edward perfectly at

was close to her father, with her arm ronnd his neck;

made her heart so heasy; she only knew that much
as she had loved her aunt during the journey, her kiss
and kind words at that moment made her loe er
more than ever.
Never had there heen a happier meal at Oakwood
than the substantial tea which was speedily ready for
the travellers. So much was there to hear and tell;
Percy's wild sallies; Caroline'as animated replies (she
had now quite recovere her temper); Herhert's gentle
care of Ellen, by whom he had stationed himself (even
giving up to her his usual seat by his mother),
Emmeline's half shy, half enger., efforts to talk to her
cousine; Mr. and Mrs. HIamilton's earnest interest,
all combined, long before the meal was concluded, to
make Eward feel perfectly at lis ease, anl very happys,
and greatly to remove Ellen's unacknowlelged drcad.

who seemed at most only two years older thsn himself,
he hecme sensihle of a very strage and disagrceable,
but a very decided feeling of inferiority: and then, too.
it was so incomprchensible the servants all joining

more of uwe towards the suhjeet than of love, whiel

A ery short time sufficel for Perey and Emmeline
to introduee their cousins to all the deligts and
mysteries of their dear old home: and Oakwood Ilall
was really n place for imagination to revel in. It was
a large castellated mansion, fraught with both the
associations of the past, and the comforts of the pre-
sent. The injuries which the original mansion had
receied dnring the ciil war of Charles I, had, when
the family returned at the Restoration, caused mnch of
the old housc to be pullcd down, nd replaced ith
larger rooms, and greater conenicnces for a modern
dwelling-louse, retaining, however, quite sufficient of
thc past to throw intcrest arond it.
The wings were still flanked with turrets, hich ere
Percy and Emmeline's delight; and the mny stair-
cases, leading into all sorts of nooks and corers,
-and the small and most uneomfortable roos, be-
cause some of them happened to be hung with tapcstry,
and had those small narrow windows sunk in deep
recesses,-were pronounced by both far more enjoyable
than the beautiful suite of rooms forming the centre of
the ansion, and the delling of the faily. Thles
were only savedl from being diaagreeably modern-Percy
would declare-by their beautiful richly-polished oaken
panels, and by the recesses hich the large winlows

brod carved oaken balustrade, leading to a gallery
above, which opened on the seerual sleeping apart-
ments, and thus permitting the full height of the
mansion, from base to roof, to be visible from the
hall. The doors visible in the gallery opened mostly
on dressing-rooms, or prirate sitting-rooms, whiceh led
to the large airy sleeping-rooms, to which the serrants
hal aecess by back stairenses leading from their hall;
and so leaving the oaken stairense and gallesry entirely
to the use of the family, and of many s game of noisy
play had that gallery been the scene. There had been
a heautiful little chapel adjoining the mansion, but it
was mercilessly bnrnt to the grounl by the infatuated
Puritans, and nevcr restored; the venerable old
church of the village henceforth serving the family of
the Ill.
Situated on the banks of the Dart, whose serpcntine
windings gae it the appearance of a succession of
most lovely lakes, Nature had been so lavisl of her
beauties in the garden and park, especially in the mag-
nificent groth of the superb oaks, from which the

The le, William IIoward had acccpted Mr. IIamilton's
eagerly-proffered iuvitation to become his rector, nnd
ndertake the education of his boys, from ery peculiar
circumstances. IIe had been minister of a favorite
church in one of the sonthern towns, and master of an
establishment for youths of high rank, in both which
capacities he had gien uniersal satisfaction. The
reprehensible conduct of some of is pupils, carried on
at first so secretly as to elude his knowledge, at length
became so notoriout as to demand examination. He
had at first refused all credence, but when proved, by
the confused replies of all, and alf confession of some,
he briefly and emphatically laid before them the enormity
of theisr conduct, and declared, that as confidence was
entirely broken between them, he would resign the
honour of their education, refusing to admit them any
longer as mcembers of his establishment. In vain the
youg men implorcd him to spare them the disgrace of
such expulsion; he was inexorable.
This conduct, in itself so upriglt, vas painted by the
smarting oflenders in such colours, that MIr. IIoward
gradually but surely found his school abanlonel, anl
himself so misrepresentet, that a spirit less self-pos-
sessed and secure in its own integrity must have sunk
beneath it. But he had some true friends and none

minate, that Grahame, to counteract tlese eil influ-
eces, adopted a contrary extreme, and, hy a system of
constant reserse and scserity, bccame an object of as
much terror to his children as he was to his wife. bBut
he did not pursue this conduct without pai, and never
did he visit Oakwood without bitter regret that his
home was not thc same.
MIr. anl MIrs. IIamilton had often tried to alter the
uspect of affairs at MIoorlands,-the former, by entreat
ing Grahame to be less seere; the latter, by urging
Lady IHelen to a firmer made of conducet, But those
friendly efforts were as yet entirel nseless. Grahame
became a member of Parliament, which took his family
to London for five or six months in the year-a particu-
larly agreeable change to Lady Helen, who then associated
with her sisters, whose families were conducted much
on the same fashion as her own, but unfortunately
only increasing the discomfort of MIoorlands when they
returned to it. And this was the more to be regretted,
from the act that both Grnhame and his wie were full
of good intentions, and had the one been more yield-
ing, and the other more firm, there might have been no
small share of happiness for bath.
Bnut heasy as Laly Ilelen thought her trial in the
want of her hushand's confidence and love, and which
she had greatly brought upou hersel, it was light in com-
parison with that of Mrs. Greille, another near neigh-
hour anl aluel friend of MIrs. IIamilton. he had
loved and married a man whose winning manners and
appenrance, and an ever-arying flow of intelligcnt eon-
versation, had completely concealed, till too late, his

hopelessness as to the fruit of hesr anxious labours, had
she not possessed that clinging, single-hearted trust
which taught her that no diftficulty should deter from a
simple duty, and that nothing as too hardl for Him

TE part of the day which to Emmeliue Iamilton
was the happiest of all, was that in which she and
Caroline, and now, of course, Ellen, were with their
mother alone. Not that she particularly likel the very
quiet employment of plain work, which was the thcinr
usual occupation, but that she could talk without the
least restraint either about her lessons, or her leasures,
or her thoughts, and the stories or histories se had
becn reading, and if she thought wrong no one ever
correeted her so deligltfully and impressivrely as
 Mamma.'' The morings, from three to four hours,
aecording as their age and studies required, were always
under the control of MIiss Harcourt, witl such visits
from MIrs. Iamilton as gave an increased interest to ex-
ertion, and such interruption only as permitted their
practice and lessons in sic, which three times a week
MIrs. IIamiton hnd as yet herself liestowed. The
dressing-bell always rung at half-past thrce, and dinner
was at four, to ullow the lads' retnrn from Mr.
Howar's, whose daily lcssons commenced at nine and
concluded at thrce. From hlf-past one to half-past
tlrcc in te vcry short days was deoted to rcereation,
walking, or rivsing, and in the longer, to Emmeline's
favorite time-an hour at work with her mother, and

the remainder to the preparation of lessons and exer-
cises foe the next day, which in the winter occupicl
from fie to six. From six to seen in the sume gene-
rally gloomy season they read aloud some entertaining
baok with their mother and Miss Harcourt, and seen
was the delightful hour of a general reunion at tea, and
signal for such reereation till nine as they felt inclined
for; their brothers haing been employed for MIr
Howard part of the time between dinner and te, with
sufficicnt earnestness to enjaoy te rest and recreation
afterrds, quite as buoyantly and gladly as thcir
sisters, and many a merry dnnee enlivened their wintcr
evenings.
In thc summer, of comrse, this laily routine was
frequently varied by most delightful excursions in the
couutry. MIrs. Hamilton earnestly longing to implant
a love of Nature and all its fresh pure associations in
the minds of her childen while yet young, knowing that
onee obtained, the pleasures of the world would he far
less likely to obtain too powerful dominion. That which
the world often terms romanee, she felt to be a high
pure sense of poetry in the Lniverse and in Man, whieh
she was quite as anxious to instil as many mothers te
root out. She did not helieve that to cultivate the
spiritual needed the banishment of the matter of fact;
but she belieed, that to infuse thc latter with the formcr
wold he teir best and surcst preventive against all
tha was low and mean; thceir bcst help in te realiza-
tion of a constant unfailing piety. For the same renson
she cultivated a taste for the beautiful, not only in her
girls, hut in her boys-and heauty, not in arts and
Natnre alone, but in claracter. She did not allude to

beauty of merely the igh anl astriking kind, but to the
lowly virtues, struggles, faith, and heroism in the poor-
their forbearace and kinuess to one another-marking
something to admirce, teen in the most rugged and surly,
that ai first sighl would seem so little worthy of notice.
It was gradually and almost unconsciously, to accustom
her daughters to such a train of thought and sentiment,
that she so particnlarly laid aside one part of the ay to
hae them with her alone ; ostensibly, it was to give part
of thecir day to working for the many poor, to whom
gifts of ready-made clothing are sometimes much more
valuable than money ; but the edueation of that one hour
she knew might, for the right cultiation of the heart,
do more than the mcre teaeling of five or six, and that
cducation, much as sheloed and valuel MIiss IIareourt,
she had from the first resoled should come from her
alone.
To Emmeline tis mole of life was so happy, she
coul not imagine anything happicer. But Caroline often
nnd often enied her great frienl Annie Grahame, and
beliered that occasional isits to Lonlon woull make her
much happier, than remaining all the year round at
Oakwood nd only with her own family. She knew
the expression of such scntiments would mect no syn-
pathy at home, anl eertainly not obtain thcir gratiiication,
so she tricd to checkc them, cxcept when in company
with Annie and ady lIelen; but her mother knew tlem,
nnd from the discontent and unhappiness they so often
cngentdered in hcr clild, caused her both pain and
Incasiness. Lut sle dil not waver in her plans, bccausc

done, check Carolinc's association with MIiss Grahame.
She knew that those principles must be indeed of little
worth, which eould only aetuate in retirement, and when
tree from temptation. That to prevent intimaey with
all, except with those of whom she exuctly approved,
would be impossible, if she eer meant her daughters to
enter the world; and therefore she endeavourcd so to
obtain their unrestrained confdence and affection, as to
be regrded both now, and when they were youg
women as their first, best, and truest friend, and that
end obtained, intimacies with their young companions,
however varied their character, she felt would do na
permauent harm.
 Dcar, dcear MIannl'' exelaimed Emmeline, one
moring about a wcek after her parents' return, and
droppihg er work to speak more eagerly, ``you canot
think how delightful it does seem to have you at home
again; I missed this our of the ly so ery much; l
did not know how much I locdit when I always had it,
but when you were away, every time tle hour came I
missed ou, and longed for you so mch tht-lI am

 Wh, how Percy must have laughed at you, Emmy.''
Indeedi, he did not, Mamma; 1 tink he fclt lalf

home from 3Ir. Iloward's, and could not rush up int

HOYE IFLEENCE.
I dil not miss hIamma after the frst, quite so much
as you did, Emmeline,'' repliedl her sister, ingenuously;
``becuse when Lady Ielen returned from London, she
made me go there so often, and as I know you never
refuse mo that indulgence, MIamma, and Miiss IIarcourt
did not objeet, I was glad to do so.''
I have only oune objeetion, my dear Caroline, and I
think you know what that is.''
That wheneer I am with Annie I think and wish
more about going to London, MIamma, I am afraid 1
do; but indced I try to think that you must know what
is hetter for me, and try not to be discontented, though
sometimes I kow I do not succeed,'' and her eyes filled
with tears.
I am satisfied that you endeasour to trust my
cxperience, my loe; I am quite aware of all the diffi.
culties you hae to encounter in doing so, and therefore
your most trifling conquest of self is a great source of
comfort to me. I myself should feel that the pain of
increased discontent, and so of course inecreased diffi-
culty in conquering its constant aeeompaniment, ill
temper, would more than halance the pleasure of Annie's
societ, and so not indulge in the one so often at the
expense of tho other; but of that yon are yourself the
best judge, and you know in such a case l alwvays permit
you to be a free agent. 3ut what hs become of Mlary,
Emmeline ? I begged MIrs. Greville tolet you e as much
togetluer as possible luring y nbsence; did not her
society aflord you some plcasure?'
 Oh, yes, MIamma, a great deal; but unfortunately
MIr. Greville was at home almost all the time you wvere
away, and poor Mary could not often lente her rother,
EOIE INLEcCE.
129
and I don't feel as if it were quite right for me to go so
often there, when he is at home. I am sure MIrs,
Greville and Mlary must both feel still more uncomfort-
nble when any one is there to see how unkind he is, and
hear the cruel things he says. Oh, low I do wish 1
could make poor Mlary more happy.''
 She would tell you that affection is a great comfort
to her, LEnmny.''
 Yours and Herbert's may be, Mamma, beeause you
are both so much better and wiser thn I am; but I can
do so little, so very little.''
 You can hbe and are a great source of interest to her,
my dear; and when we wish very much to make another
person happ, you may be tquite sure that the most
trifling act gires pleasure; but Ellen looks ery much
as if she would like to know who this MIary is, that is so
tried-suppose you tell her.''
Emmeline eagerly obeyed, painting her friend in suel
gloing eolours, that Ellen felt, however trie sheight
bce, a person so good and holy nust be happy notwith-
standing; besides, to be loved so by MIrs, IIamilton and
Ilerbert, discoered to her mind such superior qualitics,
that she almost wondered how Emmeline could speak of
her so familiarly, and think of her as her own particular
friend. But the conrersation on her and tlcn on otler
topics so intereste her, that she was ahost as sory as
her cousin, when it was interrupted by a visit from Lady
Hlen Grahame and her dnughter.

I rather think the change of season, and not my

replied MIrs. HIamilton, in the same tone; 'but even
London will not chnge your kind thought for me,
Hclen.''
Nay, I must follow the example of my neighonrs,
rich and poor, whom you may appeal to as to the fact
of your absenec causing terrible lamentation; ask this
naughty little girl too, who scarcely eer came to see

she glanced on the deep mouning of her friend, and
indeed of all the group;  what a ceold, hcartless being
you must beliee me to run on in this way, when tere
has been so sad a cause for our absence-poor Elcnorl''

addrcssing MIiss Grahame, who was already deep in co-
versation with Caroline, `I hve another little girl to
introuce to you, wlom I hope you will be as fiendly
with as with Caroline and Emeliue,'
The youg lady turned round at the ords, but her
sole uotiee of lEllen, who had comc tiidly forward, was
a haughty stre, a fashionable curtsey, and a few
nintelligible worls, which eaused Emmeline to feel so
indignant, that it was with dilliculty she kept silence,
and me Ellen so uncomfortable, tht it was with evcn
more than her usual shyness, she receiel Lady lIelen's

Ellen might hae found courage to reply, for there
was an interest attached to all who had known her
mother; but as she raised her eyes to speak, she again
encountered Annie's rude and disagreeable stare, and
the worls died on her lips. The young party were,
howeer, soon all in the garden, for Mrs. Hamilton
nerer made any scruple in dismissing her clildren,
when she wished to speak on subjects she did not
choose them to henr; and she was anious so to relate
Eleanor's illness and change of sentiment, as to remoe
the impressions which her early career had left on
Lady IIelen's memory.

 Well, how do you like your new cousins, what are

 Mamma says we must remember how short a time

Ellen is not strong enough to be very liely.''
Tlat does not at all account for her looking
cross. I m sure she has nothing to be ill-tempered
about; there are fcw girls in her situation who would have

Annic Grahame was a few months younger tha
Caroline Hamilton (who was nearly thirteen), but fromn
having been emancipatel from the nursery and echool-

pcetty and engaging,-she was very much noticed, and
her visits to her titled relations in London, hy cansing

Ilelen's family and to Laly Helen herself this ade her

exactly tcll, except that it was so very delightful to hae
some one in the countr to whom she could dilate on
all the pleasures of London, lisplay her new dresses,
new music, drawings, work, &c. (uot however consider-
ing it at all necessary to mention that er work and
drawings were only lalf her own, and Caroline was
much too truthful herself to imagine it, and her mother
too anxious to retain that guileless simplicity to cn-
lightcn her, as she was well capable of doing). Annie's
quick eye discovered that at such times Caroline cer-
tainly enviel her, and she imagined she must be a
perason of infinite consequence to excite such a feeling,
and this was sucl a pleasant sensation, that she sought
Caroline as much as possible dnring their stay at MIoor-
lands. O MIrs. Hamilton, indeed, sle staood in such
ucomfortahle awe, though that lady never addressed
er exeept in kindness, that as she grew older, it ac-

annoyed her quite as much as he desirel.
Eward's hasty progress to his aunt was slightly
checked at seeing a stranger with her, hut when he was

I am not so nconscionable as to expect you t

thing in Emmeline's guileless confidence irresistibly
claiming love.,  All we hae to do when we fiud no-

Yes, love; she is very mch noticed, and so perhaps

this morning. Are you tirel of listening tome, dearest,
or shall we read it over again together?''
Emmcline's only answcr was to run eagerly for her
little Bible, and with gloviug cheeks and sparkling
eyes listen to her mother, as she turned to the fifteenth
Palm, and reading it through, particularly pointed out
the third erse, and so cxplained it, ns easily and
happily to satisfy her child as to the Divine authority
for all that she had said, and to stamp them still more
forcibly on her memory.
`And now I do not mean to talk to you any more,
my arling,'' she said, kissing the little earnest face
upturned to hers.  You have heard quite enough to
think ahout, and I nm sure you will not forget it, so
go and play; Ellen must be wondering what has be-
come of you.'' And aguin full of glee, the lappy child
bounded away, exclaiming, as she lil so, `oor Annie,
I am glad I am not exposed to such temptations, for
I am sure I should not be able to resist them eithor''
But though any one who had scen her the next half
hour might hare fancied that a serious thought or
sobcr tsk coald not approach er, neither the con-
ersation nor te sslm was iorgotten; with IIorbert's
explanatory assistance, she not only found the 'salm,
but committed it to memory; and the sccond Sunday,

ivid fancy and very ersatile powers occasioned her
actunl lessons to he considered such drudgery, as to
require a great effort on her part to retain them. The
sense, indeed, if she understood it, she learned quickly
enough; but she preferred her own language to any
one's else, and MIrs. IIamilton had some liiliculty in
making her undcrstand that in time of study she re-
quired correetness, and not fancey; and that the atteution
which was necessary to conquer the words as ell as
sense of her lesson as much more important and
valuable, howeer lisagreeable it might seem, than the
facility of clanging the language to something prettier
than the original
When, therefore, ns in the present case, she olun-
tarily unlertook, and conquered, really a dilficult task
for a Iittle lively girl, ler parents had no scruple in
giring the only reward she cared for-thcir approbation,
It was in the bestowal of praise MIrs. Hamilton was
compnelled to be almost pninfully guardel. Se found
that the least epression of unusual approbation caused
Caroline to relax in her efforts, thinking she had done
quite enough, and perniciously inereasing her already
too exaltcd ideas of herself. Wile to Emmeline it was
the most powerful inccntie to a continunncee in im-
provement, aud deterined conquest of her faults.
There was constantly a read on the mother's eurt,

She was watching with delight Emmeline's un-
rcstrained enjoyment of her father's cnresses and lively
conersation, in which Percey ns usual joined-for
Tiny, as he chose to call er, was his especial pet and
plaything-when she was startled by alow and evidently
sppressed sob near her; Ellen was bending over a book
of Bille-stories wvhiel Herbert had lent her, and herlong
ringlets completely concealed her face; Mliss HInrcout
and Curoline both laoked up surprised, but a rpid sign
from MIrs. Hanilton presrented their msking any remark.
Herbert fxed his eyes pityingly on his little cousin, as
if wishing but not liking to adress her. Edwrd was
the only one of the party who moved. He was busily
egagedin examiing a large Noah's ark, and epeculating
as to its resemblance to a ship and its powers of floating,
but after a few minutes' apparent thought he left it, and
sitting down on Ellen's chair, put his arm round her,
and begged her to find a picture af Noah's ark, and see
if it were at all like the toy. Clecred by his aflection,
she conquered vith a strong effovrt the choking in her
thront, and turnel to the page, and tried to sypathise
in his wondcr if it rcally were like tle vessel in which
Noal was saed, and where he could have put all the

ut MIrs. IIamilton didnot forget tle child's involun-
tary evidence of suffering, and ainly tried to imagine
what at that moment could have causel it. IIerbert
seemcd to think about it too, for the next day she hcard
him ask Elwart-
If he knew why his sister always looked so snad?
if e thought it was becanse she was not yet reconciled
to Oakwoolt
It is not that,'' was Edward's reply: `she has al-
ways looked and seemed sad, as long as lIcan remember
er. One renson may be, she was always ill in India,
and Pnpa was often telling me how very much she
uflered, and how patiently she bore it; and then, too,
she knew I was poor lnmma's favorite (his oice
trembled), and used to make her ery unhappy ; but I do
not know why she is so very sad now, unless she is ill
agai, and that no one can tell, for she ncver will
complain.''

Edwarl ith eager willingness communicated all he
new, though, from his being so constnutly with his

`It was a very long time before MIamma permitted me
to sce her,'' adde Edward, ``and when I did, I remem-
hcr bcing almost frightened, she was so altered, so pale,
and thin and weak; and tlcn she was ery ill after poor
Papa's death ; but since then she has never complained,
and never kept her bed; but I know sle is often in
pain, for when I have touched her forehead sometimes,
it has burnt my hand like fire.'
IThis cildish explanation certainly told Mrs. IIamilton
more than she had known before; but that Ellen had
wituessed the fearful scene of er father's death was
still concealed. Lwarl, as he grew older, though he
did not know why, seemed to shrink from the subject,
particularly that he had bcen at a ball the same awful
night
A few days afterwards, as MIrs. IIamilton was crossing
the large hall on her way to the school-room-for so,
spite of Percy's determination that it should receive the
more learned and refined appellation of studio, it was
still called-she oerheard Caroline's voice, exclaiming,
in angry impaticnce-
` Indeed, I shall not, I hae enough to do with my
own lessons, without attending to other people's. It is
yaur idleness, llen, not the difficulty of your lesson;
for I am sure it is easy enough.''
 or shame, Carolinel'' was Emmeline's indignant
reply. `` She is not idle, and I am sure her lesson is
not so easy; I wish I could explain it properly.''
 You know Miss IIarcourt herself said she was care-

niece from earliest infancy; and how much more would
she hae wished this, had she known that MIrs. ortescue
had really bcen advrised to do with Ellen as MIr. Mlaitlanl
had said, but that believing it merel an idle fancy, and
persisting too in her own headstrong idea that it was
ill-temper not illness which renderel Ellen so disagee-
able, she wonld not stoop so to conquer her unfortunatc
pride as to ask such a faour of her relaties, and tc
whom else could she appeal ? Colonel Fortescue had
uone but distant cousins. She did satisfy a qualm of
conuscience by once suggestig to her husband-nas her
own idea, however, not as that of an experienced ph-
sician-that as he fancied Ellen was always ill, she
might be hetter in England; but, as she expected, not
only his intense loe for his little girl rose up against the
idea of separation, but his pride reolted from sending
her to claim the pity of relatives who had so completely
cast off her parents: yet had he been told it was abso-
lutely neeessary for her health and so greatly for hor
happiness, he wonld not hae hesitated to sacrifice every
thought of self. But Eleanor, satisfied that sle had
done her duty, and delighted that in one respect he was
quite as proud as she was, neer again referred to the
subjeet, anl the physician who had thus advised, from
his constant remorals, he nerer chanced to meet.
Great indeel was the amount of childis suffering
which this selfish decision on the part of he mother
oceasioned Ellen. We do not mean the pain of con-
stant languor itself, though that in its full amount our

of; they perhaps think it almost a pleasant change,
the cre and petting and presents so often lavished on
a brief decided illness : but that is a very lifferent thing
to that kinl of suffering which only so affects them as to
be dull and heavy, they do not know wh, and to makce it
such a very difficult task to learn the lcssons others find
so eas; anl snch a pein sometimes to more, that they
are thought slow and unwilling, and perhaps even idle,
when they would gladly run, and help, and work as
others; and so weask sometimes, that tears start at the
first harsh or unkind worl, and they are thought cross,
when they do not in the least feel so; and this not for
a few weeks, but with few exceptions, the trial of months
and even years.
Anl this was Ellen's-which not een the tenderest
nnd most unfailing care of her aunt could entirely guard
her from. It is a most difficult thing for those who
are strong and healthy themselves to understand and
always bear with physical suffering in others. MJiss
Hareourt, though in general free from nnything like
prejudice, and ardently desirous to follow up her own
anl MIrs. IIamilton's ideas of right and wrong, could
not so gavern her affectione as to feel the same towards
Ellen as she did towards Eward and the children she
had lived with and taught so long. Her task with Ellen
required more paticnce and forhearance and care than
with cither of the others, and sometimes she could not
help helieving and acting towards her as if it were wilful
idlencss and carclessness, not the langor of disensc.

of such n remarkably-gifted mind, and so bright in
aspect, so sweet in temper, that illness scemed to
have spiritualized instead of deadened every faculty.
She could not understand as MIrs. IIamilton did, the
force of cireumastances in producing from nearly tle
same cause two such different effects, nor how it was
that complcte negleect had engendered more eils than
indiscreet indulgenuce: but that it appenred to have
done so, was nhappily only too evident not only to
Miss Harcourt but to MIrs. Hamilton. It seemed almost
surprising, and certainly a proof of a remarkably good
disposition, that Edward appeared so free from great
faults, and of snch a warm, generous, frnnk, and see-
ingly unselfish nature, so open to conviction, and to all
good impressions, that, except occasional fits of violent
passion, there reslly was, as far as his aunt and uncle
could pereeive, nothing to complain of. Tey did not
know that he stood in such awe of MIr. IIamilton, from
his mother's lessons of his exceeding sternness, that
he exercised tle greatest control over himself; and he
was so excessively fond of MIr. Howard, and his days
glided by in such varied and delightful employment,
that there was no temptation to do wrong; except certain
acts of trifling disobedience, of more consequenee from
the self-will they betrayed than the acts themselves,
but which might have been sources of anxiety to his
aunt, and lessened her confidence in him had she known
them; but she did not, for lllen not only coustantly
conceale, but was the sufferer for him, and so brought
reproof and suspicion on herself, which, could the truth
have been known, might hacbeen averted. Bnt truth

of net as wcll as word had neer been impressed on
Elward; and, therefore, thongh he was constitutionally
too brave to utter a falsehool, too houorahle to shield
himself at the expense of anotler, if he knew that other
suffered, he had been too long taught to belicve that
Ellen was his iuferior, and must always gire up to him,
to imagine that he was ever aeting deccitfully or unman-
fully in permitting her to conceal his acts of disobedience.
Tere was so mueh to love and admire in Edward,
tlat neither MIr. nor MIrs. lamilton imagined the real
eakness of his character-that those lovenble qualities
nll sprung from natral impulse, uusustained by any-
tling like principle. The quickess and apparent fer-
our with which he reccived thc religious imprcssions
thcy and MIr. Ioward sought so earnestly to instil, in
the short time that was allowed tlem before he entered
the navy, they augured so hopefully from, that not only
his preceptor and uncle, but his ever anxious aunt, looked
forward to his career with scarcely a doubt as to its
probity and honour.
Ellen caused her infinitely more anxicty. There was
a disregard to truth, a want of openness aud canlour,
which, though Mrs. IIamilton bclieved the etects of
neglect nnd extreme timidity, both hcr husband nnd Miss
IIareourt feared were natural MIueh indeed sprug

indeed in extreme cases of fear-and never to her father
that she had ever spoken falsely; but to Mrs. IIamilton's
high principlcs, whiclh by extreme diligence and care
she had as suecessfully imparted to her own children,
een coucealrent was often an aeted untruth, and of
this fault and equivocation Ellen was but to often
guilty: exciting MIiss Harcourt's and Caroline's prc-
judices yet more against her. The latter with all her
faults neer swerved from the rigid truth, and had a
strong contempt and dislike towards all those who did-
escept her friend Annie, who, as she always took care to
speuk the truth to her, she did not suspect of being less
carefnl than herself. Emmeline, who had hal some diffi-
culty in restraiuing her love of exaggeruation, and also
in so conquering her own timidity and fear as always to
speak the truth, only pitie Ellen, but did not love her
the less.
Of course it was not till some months had passed that
these lights and shadows of character in tho orphans,
and in the opinions they clled forth in those around
them, could be discosered: but notwithstandig she
stood almost alone inher opinion, notwithstanding there
was ery little outward evidence tlat she vas correct,

A YULNG ETLIAN IN  P1SSION.-A WALl.-
A 8CENE OT DI9TRE3S.
OB ery fine morning in Mlay, Mrs, Iamilton invited
Eward to join her in a walk, intenting alao to call at
Moorlands and Gresille MIanor on their way. The
Iads were released for a few days from their attcndancc
on MIr. IIoward, that gentleman haing been sum-
moned on some clerical business to lExzeter. Percy as
to accoang his father on an equestrian excursion;
IIerbert had heen commissioned by Emmeline some
days before to take some books to MIary Greville, and
had looked forward hisclf to spending a morning with
her. Edward, delighted at heing selected as his aunt's
companio, prepared with haste and glee for his excur-
sion. Rohert was, however, unfortunately not at hand
to gie him a clean pair of shoes (he had already spoiled
two pair that moruing by geiug into the stream which
ran through the park to sail a newlys-rigged frigate),
and angry at the telay, fearing that his aunt would not
wait for lim, he worked himself into such a iolcnt pas-
sion, that when Robert did appear he gae ent to more
abusive language than he hadt cver yet ventured to use,
concluding by hurling both his discardedl shoes at the
domestic, who only escaped a seere blow by startiug
aside, an permitting tlem to go through the window.

 Robert, leave the room: I esire that you will not
agai gie your assistance to MIaster lortescue till he
knows how to ask it,'' was MIrs. iIamilton's most
uexpeeted interference, and Elward so started at her
voice and look, that his passion was suddcnly enlned.
'Finish your toilette, and when you have found your
shoes and put them nway, you Iay join me in the
breakfast-room, Edward. I only wait your pleasure,''
And eer lid Elward lenve her presencee more gladly.
Shame had suddenly conquered anger, and, though his
chest still heaved and his checks were still Rushed, he
id not utter another word till nearly a quarter ofa
mile on their wnlk. Twice he had looked up in his
aunt's face as if about to speak, but the exprcssion as
so ery grave, that he felt strangely afraid to procced.
At length he exelaimed-
 Yo are displeased with me, dear Aunt; but indeed
I could not help feeling angry.''
I nam still more sorry than displeasel, Edward;
I had hoped you were lenrning more control, and to
know your duty to a domestic better. Your uncle-''

Nor lid he. I heard all that passed, and I could

Tho colonr rose to Edard's temples, but he set his
teeth and clenchel his hand, to prevent any farther

serring him, continued-
 He said that his young master Perc never required
impossibilities, and though often impatient never abused

speak so to me again.''
`And what prevented Robert acting in the same
manner? Do you think he has no feeling ?-that he
is iucapable of such cmotions as pain or anger ?''
Edward stood for a minute quite still and silent.
I id not think anything about it,'' he said at

Edward looked up surprised.

There was so mnch in this reply to surprise Edward,
it seemed so to fill his mind with new ideas, that he con-
tinued his walk in absolute silence. That his aunt could
ever fail ns she seemed to say she had aud did, and even
still at times found it difticult to do right, wasvery strange;
but yet somehow it seemed to comfort him, and to inspire
him with a sort of courage to emulate her, and conquer
his difficulties. le had fncicd, that she could not

MIrs. Greville was not there, though the books, work,

employment hasing been the same as usual. Herbert
was ernestly eudeavouring to speak comfort, but evi-
dently without success; and MIary was in general so
controlled, that her present grief hetrayed some very
much leaier trial than ususl.
 Is your mother ill, my dear MIary? What ean hae

Alfred's cheek becme pale, his eye haggar, and his
temper uncen, his initiation was franght with sucha
new spccies of excitement and pleasure, that it rejoiced
and enconraged his father in tho same measure as it
agonized his mother, and, for her sake, poor MIary.
Tuat morning Alfed had eclared his intention of
visiting a large fair, which, with some races of but ill
repute, from the bad company they collected, was to be
held at a neighbouring town, and told his father to pre-
pare for a large demand on his cash, as he meant to try
his hand at all the varieties of gamiug which the scene
prcsented. Mr. Greville langhed heartily at what he
cnllod the boy's right spirit, and promised him all he
requirel; but thero was a quivering on her mother's lip,
a deadly paleness on her cheek, that spoke volumes of
suffering to thc heart of the observnt MIary, who
sat trembling beside her. Still Mrs. Groeville did not
speak till her hsband left the room; but then, as Aifred
was ahout to follow him, sle canght hold of his hand,
nnd implored him, with such a tone and look of agony,
only to listen to her, for her sake to give up lis intendel
pleasure; that, almost frightenel by an emotion which in
his getle mother he had scarcely eer seen, and snddenly
remembering that he had lately bceen indeed nost unkind
andneglectful to her, he threw his arms rounl her neck,
nnd promised with tenrs, that if it gave her so mch pain,
he would not go; and so sincere was his feeling at the
mnoment that, had there been no tempter nenr, he would,
in nall probnbility, hase kept his word. , but the moment

and its cause, he so laughed at his ridiculous folly, so
sneered at his want of spirit in preferring his mother's
whims to lis fatler's pleasures, that, as could not fail to
be the case, every better feeling fled. This ought to hase
heen enough; but it was too good an opportunity to ent
his ill-temper on lis wife, to be neglected. IHIe sought
her, where she was superintenling MIary's lessons, and
for nearly an hour poured upon her the most fearful
abuse and cutting taunts, ending by declaring, that all
the good she had done by her saintly cloquence, was to
banish her son from her presence, wheneer he left home,
as in future Alfed should he his companion; and that
he should begin that ery day. Mrs. Greville neither
moved nor spoke in reply; and the espression of her
countenance was so sternly calm, tlat poor hlary felt as
if she dared not give way to the emotion with which her
heart was bursting.
MIr. Greille lcfte the raom, and tley heasrd him pc-

faootsteps were heard in the hall, and the joyous voice

Neither Herbert nor Edward seemed inclined to con-
erse on their walk home, and MIrs. Hamilton was so
engrossed in thought for Mrs. Greille, that she did not
feel disposed to spenk either. Herbert was contasting
his father with Mlary's, and with such a vivid sense of

the thought, he was not, he nevet could be, grateful

A rEW days after the events of the last chapter,
Mrs. IIanmilton, accompanied by Perey, called ant

an Perey remained with him, his good-nature often
making him a companion, though there was nearly six
years difference in their age.

and does uot allow such feks; thinks it wrong to go
to such places, acting against morality, and such out of
the way ideas.''
Are these MIr. Grahame's opinions?'' inquired
Perey, almost sternly.
 Why ye-yes-why do you laook at me so
Percy? I am sure I said no harm; I only repeated
what I have heard MIamma say continuall.''
 Tht is not the veryleast excuse for your disrespect to
our father ; and if he think thus, Iwonder you should talk
of going to the races: ou cannot have his permission.''
Oh, but Mlamma has promised if I am a good boy
till then, and she can manage it, I shall go; for shc
cannot see any harm in it. And as for waiting for
Papa's permission-if I did, I should never go any-
where. IIe is so unkind, that I am always afraid of
speaking or even of playing, when e is in the room.''
You are a silly boy, Ceeil,'' replied oung Hamilton,
 Beliee me, you do not know your best frienl. I
shonld he very sorry to feel thus towards my father,''
 Oh. but yours and mine are very lifferent sort of
people. Your apa neer punishes you, or refuses you
his permission, when you wish particularly to do an-

If Papa thinks my wishes foolish, or liable to lead
me into error, he does refuse me without seruple, Cecil.

myself as to atoid actual punishment: when I was as

of me when I am good. But has Mr. IHamilton told
you not to go to the races ?''
Not cxactly: he has merely said he thinks it a day
most unprofitably wasted; and that the gambling and
excesscs always the attendant of races, are not fit scenes
for young persons. Were I to take my horse and go, hc
would not, perhaps, be actually displeased, as I am old
enough now, he says, in some things to judge for mself;
but I should be acting against his principles, which, just
now, I am not inclined to do, for I am sure to suffer
from it afterwards.''
 Yell, all I can sny is, that when I am as old as
you are, Perecy, I shall certainly consider myself under
no one. I hope I shall be at Eton by that time, and
then we shall see if Cecil Grahme has not some spirit
in him. I would not be tied down to Oakwood, and to
M. IIoward's humdrum lessons, as you nre, Percy, for
worlds.''
Take care that Cecil Grahame's spirit does not
effervesce so mch, as to make him, when at Eton,
wish himself aek at Moorlanls,'' replied Perey, laugh-
ing heartily at his young companion's grotesque attepte
at self-consequenee, by placing his cap iandily on his
eal, lourishing his cne, nd trying to ake himself
look taller. Cecil took his laugh, howeser, in good

ery often led him into error and its disngreeable con-
sequeuces; and, fearing this lad again been the case,
she playfully inquirel the cause of his most unusual
abstraetion. He coloured, but eaded the question,
and successfully roused himself to tall. IIis moter
was not anxious, for she had such perfect confidcnce in
him, that she knew if he hal committed error, he would
redeem it, and that his own good feelings and high
principles would prevent its recurrence.
It so happened, howeer, that young Hamilton, by a
series of rather imprudent actions, had plunged himself
into such a very nusual and disagreeable poesition, as
not very well to know how to extricate himself from it
without a full confession to his father; which, dnringly
brave as in general he was, he felt aslmost us if he
really had not the courage to make. One of MIr.
Hamilton's most imperative commands was, that his
sons should never incur a dcbt, and, to prevent the
temptation, their monthly allowance was an ample one,
nnd fully permitted any reereative indulgences they
might desire.
Now Percy was rather inclined to extravagance, from
thoughtlessness and a profuse generosity, which had
often caused him such anoyance as to make him
resolve again and again to follow his father's advice,
and keep some accounts of his expenditure, as a slight
check on himselt. Tue admirtion for beauty in the
fine arts, which his mother had so sedulously cultirted,
had had only one bad effect; and that was that hise
passion for prints and paintings, and illustrated and

Hamilton felt to do withiout them till his father or he
himself should visit the metropolis, and so judge of
tleir warth themselves, wns quite impossible. The
order was gien without the leastregard to price. They
arried at tle end of the month, and the young gentle-
man, to his extreme astonislcnt, discoverel that his
month's allowance had been so expeuded, asnot to leave
him a half quarter of the necessary sum. What to do
he did not ery well kno. Mr. IIarris had had great
difficulty in procuring the prints, and of course he was
bound in honour to take them. If he waited till he
could pay for tlem, he must saerifice the whole of one
month's allowanee, and then how could he keep free
Irom deht till the next? As for npplying to his father,
e shrunk from it with aetual pain. IIow could he
ask his ever kind anl indulgent parent to ischarge a
leht ineurred by such a thoughtless act of unneccs-
snry extrvagance MIr. IInrris made very light of
it, declaring that, if MIr, Percy did not pay him for a
twelvemonth, it was of no consequeuee; he would trust
him for any sum or any tine he liked. But to make no
attempt to liquidate his dcbt ws as impossible as to

many clecks and annoyances as to make him hate the

be free at least of MIr. Hlarris. The idea of disoledience
to his father in incurring a debt at all cnusing him ore

Again the first day of the montl came round, and

able conviction hat he eould only pay MIr. IIarris a third

hc thought of nothing clse. Now MIr. Harris was the

For the next few days Percy trod on air. He had

constant annoyanee he had been enduring so long, a4s
sufficient peualty for his disobedience, and after a time
gise him baek the eonfidence, which he fenrod must at

What, then, was his grief, his exation, almost his
despair, when he recognized in the poem selected, the
verses he thought and belieed he had burneltle morn-
ing after they were written; and which iu print, and
read by his sober self, seemed such a leartless, glarig,
cruel iusult, notonly on a fellow-creature, but a minister
of Gaol, that he felt alost oerwhelmed. WYhat could

wards lIerbert, with a blushing cheek and very timid
voice, asked his fhntler to grant him a great favour. He
was almost afraid to ask it, he ssid, but le hoped and
believed his parent would trust his assurance that it
was for nothing improper. It was that he might be
from home the ncxt day unattended for several hours.
IIe should go on horsebaek, but he was so accustomed
to ridc, and his horse was so steady, he hoped he might
be nullowed to go alone. MIr. Hamilton looked very
much surprised, ns id all present. That the quiet,
stulious llerbcrt slould wish to give up his favorite
pursuits, so soon too after MIr. IIoward's retnr, and go
on what appcarcd sucl a nysterious excursion, was
something so extraorinary, that various expressions of

Percey threw his arm round her waist, and kissed her
two or three times, without saying a word, and when he
startcd up and said, in his usual gay tone, that, as he was
uot going to turn truant the next day, he must go and
finish some work, she saw tears in hisees. Tht some-
thiug was wrong, she felt certain, but still she trusted in
his candour and integrity, and did not express her fears
cven to her husband.

Howard's, and Herhert at half-past nine mounted his quiet
horse, and after affectioually embracing his mother, and
again promising care and steadiness, cparted. He had

earnestly, that a double portion was preparel for the
next day. He hal said, as he was starting, that, if he
might remain out so long, he should like to call at
Groeville MIanor on his way back, take tea there, nnd

looking oer his papers before he sent them tp MIr,
IIarris, the seeming utter impossibility to stop their
circulation, was to both these single-hearted, high-prin-

with a rich living in the North. For nine months he
enjosed the most unalloyel hppiness. IIis pretty
vicarage presentel a happy comfortable home for his
parents, and the comforts they now enjoyed, earned by
the worth of their son, nmply repaid them for former
priations. One cold snowy night he was summoned
to a poor parishioner, liing nbout ten miles distant;
the road wns rugged, and in some parts dangerous ; but
he was not a man to shrink froms his duty for such
reasons. Ile was detained eight hours, during which
time the snow had fallen incessantly, and it was pitchy

almost thrilling, beeame wiry, and almost painfully
monotonos; and for some months the conflict for
submission to this inserutable and most awful trinl was
so terrible, that he nearly sunk beneath it. This was
of conrse still more physical than mental, and gradually
subsided, as, after eighteen months' resileuce in Ialeira,
where he as sent by a heneolent friend, some portion
of health returned. The same benefactor established
his father i some umhle but most weleome businest
in London, and earnestly, on his return, did his parents
persuade him to remain quietly with them, and not
undertake the ministry again; but this he could not do,
and gratcfully accepted a poor nnd most miserable

Mr. IIoward acquaintel with him. Our good minister's

as to ridicule him because he is deformed?''
 Unfortunately, my der child, there are too many
who only enter church for the sake of the sermon and
the preacher, and to eriticise seerely and uncharitably
all that differs from their preconceived ideas; to such
persons MIr. MIorton must be an object of derision.
And now I come to the real reason of my asking your
moter if she remembered him,
 Then you had a reason,'' answered Mlrs. Hamilton,
smiling; `` your story has made me wonder whether
you had or not,''
I must tax your memory once more, Emmeline,
before my cause is told. Do you recolleet, for a fort-

It is neer sufficiently guarded, and it would
require a person of higer principles tan I fear IHarris

to sell  double or trehle number of his papers. I
spoke to him at once, and bought up every one that
remainel ; but though he expressed regret, it was not
in n tone that at all satisfied me as to his feeling it,
and of course, as the paper has been published since
last uturday evening, the circulation had nearly censed.
If I could bunt know the author, I think I could make

choked with his emotion, that he could only throw
himself by her side, bury his face in her lap, and soh
for a few minutes like a child. But he recovered
imself with a strong effort, before either of his family
could conquer their anxiety and alarm, and, standing
erect, though pale as marhle, without in the least degrec
attempting excuse or extenuation, aeknowledged thc
poem as his, and poured out his whole story, with the
sole exception of how he had disposed of the money,
with which the second tiie of receiving his allowance he
had intendcd to discharge his deht; and the mnanne
in which he told that part of his tale, from the fcar
tlt it would secm like an excuse or a bosst, was
certainly more caleulated to call for doht than belief.
Herbert was about to speak, but an imploring glanee
from Percy checked him.
Mr. Hamilton was silent several minutes after his
son had concluded, before he could reply. Perey was
so evidently distressed-had suffered so much from the
consequencc of his owu errors-felt so intensely the
unintentional publication of his poem-for his fathenr
knew his truth far too well to doubt his tale, and tlere
was something so intrinsically nobhle in his brave con-

could not.

conll; ' but otherwise you must he yourself aware that
it has gien me both grief and pain, nnd the more so,
because you evidently slrink from telling me in what

some deed of folly unreealed. I condemn you to no

MswLE the young heir of Oakood had passed
no ery pleasant day. HIis thoughts since MIr. Howard's
return had been so preoccupied, that his studies had
been unusually negleeted; so much so, as rather to
exrcite the displeasure of his gentle and forbering pre-
ceptor. he emotion of the morning had not toned
to steatdy his ideas, and a severe reproof and long impo-
sition was the consequence. Not one word did he
deign to address Herhert and Ewvard, who, perceiring
him leave the Vicarage with every mark of irritation,
endeavoured, during their walk home, to soothe him.
His step was eren more rapid than that in which
he had left home, and he neither stopped nor spoke
till he had renched his father's lilrary, which, fortu-
nately for the inlulgence of his ire in words, wns un-
tenantel. He dashed his cap from his brow, flung
his books with violence on the ground, and burst forth-

sought him the moment she heard the hall-door elose,
had lenrd nearly the whole of his violent speech, and
was almost alarmed at the unusunl passion it einced.
Her voice of astonished expostulation checked his words,
but not his agitation; he threw imself on a chair, and
leaning his arms pon the table, buried his face upo
them, while his whole frame shook. llis mother sat
lown by him, and laying her hand on his arm, said
gently--

he should, as he expressel it, be a child again, and his
pride tried hnrd for victory. Een his father or lIerbert

]in a lalf-choked voice:-

 You have been ery thoughtless, very foolish, and

any graver faults,'' repliel MIrs. Ilailton, as she lightly
pushed back the clustering hair from his heated fore-
head, and the gentle touch of her cool hand seemed
s restoratie as er soothing words; and Percy as he
listened to her, as she continued speaking to him in
the same strain for some little time, felt more rcelicved
than five minutes before he thought possible, and more
than ever determined that he would never act so
thougltlessly; or, if he were tempted to do so, never
keep it concealed so long again. MIrs. 1Iamilton's
anxious desire with him, was always to do justice to
his better qualities, at the same time that sle blamed
and coninced him of his faults. It was a ery delicate
thing, and very difficnlt to sueceed in, perhaps impos-
sible, to minds less peculiarly refined and hearts lese
intensely anxious than Mrs. Hamilton's; hut no diff-
culty, no failure, had ever deterred her-and in Percy
she was already rewarled. He was of that high fine spirit,
that any unjust harshness would have actually confirmed
in error-any tnguarded wod bring argment on
argraeut, and so, for the mere sake of opposition, canse
him to abide in his opinions, when the acknowledgment

Mother, but the whirl of that night seemel to

for Mr. Howard in such a hurry (I had oerslept
myself too), that though Ihad quite resoled they should
not pollute my pocket-book any longer, I had no time
to look over my papers-thought I could not be
mistaken in their outside-burnt those I really wished
to keep, and threw those which hae caused me all
tlis pain into my portfolio. Ir I hal but bcen firm

I am quite sure, if ou will allow yourself a little
time for quiet thought, you will agree with me.''
But why should 1 inflict such pain upon myself,
granting I desere it?' answerel Perey, still much
heated; hen, though my poem is the only one that
has unfortunately met his eye, the others were quite as
galling, and my companions quite as much to blame

Percy lid not reply, but his countenance denoted
an inward struggle, and his mother alded-

IIe kissed her forehead and left her, and a fe
minutes afterwards she was summoned to join her
mother, Caroline, and Ellen in a walk. They saunteed
tlrough the gronnds in the direction of the northern
lodge, which opened on the road leading to Dartmoor;
when, not a qarter of an hour after thcey had left the
house, they were overtaken by Percy, riding at what
seemed almost a hand gullop, but he had time as he
passed his mother to graevefully doff lis cap, and her
fond heart throbbed, as she caught the expression of
his flushed but earnest face. He was out of sight in

had his fine spirit heen soothed or irritated? and a
thousand other nameless but natural fears thronged her

but his words were even more than satisfactory to his
son's eager heart, for he answered earnestly-
Pray lo not gie me any praise for my courage,

at the sixth, and refuscs to aid me farther.''
 Grshame, donot heed her,'' interposed her husbnnd,
laughing; ``she fancies there is something extraordinry
ubout Ellen, which she cannot comprehend; and I feel
certain that imagination has been playing with my

for by her early trials and constant ill-health. So I1
solse what my wife pronounces a mystery. She has
so few fancies, however, that I do not gquarrel with this,

actually took it upon herself, not being able to define
that in such self-saorifice she was also forfeiting truth;,

I was the Christmas acation-always a happy
season in the halls of Oakwood. The preious year,
the general juenile party witl which MIr. and Mrs.
IHamilton indulged thcir children on the first or sixth of
January, as circumstanees permitted, had not taken
placee, on account of MIrs. Fortescue's leath, and was
therefore this year anticipated ith even more than
usual joy. Cnroline and kEmmeline were never permitted
to go to indiscriminate partics. To or thrce, really
confined to children, their mother allowed thcir joining
with Miss IIarconrt, in the course of the year, but
their own ball was always considered thc acme of
enjoyment, especially now that Caroline began to fancy
herself very much toa old for only children's parties.
hnnie went almost everywhere with Lady IIelen, and
quite laughed at the idea of joining children, and
Caroline this year began to wish most intensely that
her mother would take er out to grown-p parties
too, nand lost all relish for the pleasnnt parties she hal
enjoyed. MIrs. IIamilton never obliged her to go out
with Emmeline and Ellcn, if she really did not vish it;

herself a woman.

Iong and tried earnestly to make their children so to

spiritually religious demanded a relinquishment of

fell to the ground, aud its beautiful blossom hung on
the stalk, presered from being quite broken off only by

it her petted clild; and poor Ellen stood paralysed; she
raised the pot mechanically, and rested the broken head

looked so well and natural, that the thought for as

Percy was soactire, so obliging, so amusing in his queer
ways of working and talking, that she almost forgot
the impending trial, till she met her aunt and cousins at

business witl his uncle; tat he never cast a thought as

But what right had Ellen to touch the stand ?'
 None-she has both disobeyed and again tried to

Ellen quitted the room without ansering; but it was

on her armse which rested on the tnble, so despondingly,

aunt's custom, from the time she had been at Oakwood,
to risit her daughters and niece before they went to

MIrs. IIamilton had purposely refrained from indulging
her own inclinations, as well as comforting Ellen,
hoping still more to impress upon her how greatly she

happiness, but Mr. and MIrs. Hamilton did not expect
that all tleir other children were to be like him. They
were contented, and intensely thankful also, to perceive
that diverse as were their characters, still the constant
sense of God's presence and of lIis infinite loe was
actie and earnest in them all, inciting love and rever-
ence for Herbert, een though they could not sympathise
with him entirely. Another peculiarity of Mlr. Hamilton
consisted in his permitting no Sunday schools at
Aeliag and his othcr villages. The Saturlay after-
uoons ere set apart instead of the Sunday. He
wished his wife, and daughters when they were old
enough, to superintenl them, and help the children in
prcparing for the Sunday serices and fSunday enjoy-
ments; but he particularly disliked the system of
oerwork on a day of rest, which could not fail to be
the case, if tlere were sclools to attend to, twice or
three times a day as well us church.
It being the last day of the old yer, MIr. Howard

ns IlIerbert should attend church that afternoon, and
the lads, without the least reluctance, consentel; Mr.
lIamilton and MIiss IHIarcourt were going too, and
Caroliue and Emmeline, of their own accord, asked
permission to accompany them. Ellen's pale suffering

indecision. The next night was her clildren's ball, and
it was, too, the first day of a new ear-always in her
happy circle a festivl of joy and thankfulnesas. Ellen's
face certainly looked as if she had suffered quite enougl
to prevent the recurrence of her fault, but so it had

Hamilton sat for some time, after her children had left
her, in meditation, trying to silence the pleadings of
affectian, and listen only to reason; as to whether con-
tinued seerity or returning kindness would be the
more effective, and sase hoth Ellen and herself any
further pain.
To the child herself physical sulering was so in-
creasing as gadnally to deaden mental, till at last it
became so seere, that she felt sick and faint. Sle

similarly suffcring, and the lotion which er aunt

Ellen leant her forehcad against tle side of her little
bel, and held the curtain tightly clasped, as if so to
prevent the utterance of the hysteric sob that would
rise in her throat, though she did not know what it was.
But the wholly unexpeeted sound of MIrs. IIamilton's
voice sayiug close by her, `I am afraid you hnve one
of your very bad headaches, Ellen,'' so startled her, as
to make her raise her heal suddenl; and the move-
ment caused such agony, tlat, spite of all her efforts,
she could not preent an almost convulsive cry of
pain.
My dear childl I had no idea of paiu like tbis;

was close at hand witl the remedies she wanted, and she

`` Again your old mistake, Ellen. I ould so mueh,
so very much rather hcar yo sny you were resoleel to

mistalen fancy that you never shall; but you are too
nwell to listen to me now; we st try all we can to
remove this terrible paiu, and then see if we cean bring

And for above an hour did Mrs. IIamilton, with the
most patient tenderness, apply the usual remedies, cheered
by fiuding that, though much more slowly than usual,
still by legrees the violence of the pain dil subside, and
the hysterical affection gie way to natural and quiet

give her courage to spek the truth, to help her not
to be so frigltened, but to guide hcr in her diflicult
path. Mlrs. lIIamilton little guessed how difficnlt it was,
but she hoped more from the effects of her prescnt
penitence than she had done yet. She had copietd, too,
several verses from the various parts af Old and New
Testament which were condemnatory of falsehood, and
her nunt felt no longer undecided as to her course of
action.
 You have emnployed your solitary hours so well, my
dear Ellen,'' she eaid, as when the chill awoke, and
lookel anxiously towards her-she kisscd her cheek with
cven more than her usual fondness--`` that I scarcely re-
quire your assurance of repentance or promiscs of amend-
ment. When you ave taken some coffee, and think you

tration of tle fcarful sin of flsehool from the Old

And when llen had taken tle delicious cup of coffce,

Ellen's mind, tlat she never forgot it.
Do you think Elisha knew where he had been, and
what he had done before he asked him ?'' she venturel
timidly to inquire, as her annt ceased;  Gehazi had told
a falsehood alrealy to Naaman. Do yon think God

The lights, the joyous soices, even er unele's kind
greeting, almost oerpowered poor Ellen; as Perey, still
preserving his character of an admirable nurse, laid her
carefully on a couch in the sitting-room, where not
only tea was waiting, but the celebratel family tree,
which Mrs. IIamilton's anxiety and Ellen's sorrow had
caused them hoth to forget, was displayel with een
more than usual taste and heauty.
MIr. IIamilton, when young, had been a great deal
with his father in Germany, Denmark asnd Swedlen,
and brought from the first and latter country certain
domestic observances which had especiully pleased him,
as so greatly enhancing the cnjoyments of home, and
elping to a right nderstanding between parents and
children, by inereasing their mutual love and confidence.
The family tree, or Christmss Tree, as it vas callel,
wns one of these, and from their earliest years it had
been one of the children's greatest delights on Ne
Year's Ee. Of course, as tley grew older, and
their tastes improved, the tree itself, its suspended
presents, and its surrounding decorations increased in
beauty, and it had never been prettier than it was this
year. The whole of the preceding afternoon had the
young artists labourel in preparing it, for of course,
as the next day as Sunday, it ws obliged to be all
finished by the Saturday night; the servantas eager in
all things to enlance the happiness of those whosc
parents made them so happy, did not care what trouble

oricl window, in the centre of wlich ecess (which was
ulmost as large as a moderately sizedl room) they placed
te tree, which was a ery large gracefully-cut spruce
fir; it was placed in a tub filled with the snme soil as
that in which the tree grcw, so that by watering and
care it remained fresh for some time. The tub hich
contained it, wns completely hiddcn by thc ilowering
shruls that were plaeed round it, rising in an expauding
pyramid, by means of scveral flower-stands, till the
recess seemc one mass of leaf and flower; amongst
which the superb searlct geranium, that in Devonshire
gros so luxuriantly all throughi the winter, shining
against its own beatiful leaf, the brilliant berries of
the holly, with their dark glistening branches, the
snow-berry and flowcring myrtle, shone pre-eminent.
Smuall lamps glittered tlrough the lowers, and were
suspendcd in sufficient profusion from the pendent
branehes of the tree to half rcseal and half hide tle
arious gifts and treasures that were there deposited;
nnd altogether the eflect from erery part of the rooni
was really striking

of claraeter or some ruling faney, een in such a simple
thing as the manufacture and presentation of home
gifts. Their own idea of family ties was so strong and
so holy, that one great aim in the education of their
chilen was to make them not onlg loe cnch other,
but hare thought and attention for indivilual feelings
and wishes, and so heighten feeling hy action, not
depend entirely on natural ties. MIrs. Hamilton had
known many young persous who were larish in atten-

of enjoyment witlin themseles, and thence allowing
tlem to enhance the pleasures of others, were indeed
most gratifying to those earnest and affeetionnte guard-

possess; but with the recollection of forer folly cry
fresl in his memory, he had actually succceled in driving
them from his mind, and gave them up as unattainablc,
till he was richer at least. For Herbert there was a fine

beautiful a work of art, in its `'getting up,'' as Percy
called it, as its letter-press, which to IHerbert was beyond

why it should be so carefully concealed, by the way in

TIIE ctDRE's BALL.
261
lr the thought of thcir promised ball were the first
that entered the minds of the young party at Oakwood,
as they opened thcir eyes on Ne Year's bDay, it was
not very unnatural. Perey gloried in the anticipation of
being master of the ceemonies, and in conducting the
wlole affair with such inimitable grace and gallantry,
that cery one shonld declare it was far superior to any
party, old or young, of the season, except Mlr. IIoward's;
that aa beyond him, he said, for he could not put MIr.
Hoard's head on his shoulders. Herbert anticipated
thc cnjoment of MIary Greville's society, talking to and
dancing with her undisturbed, and to hearing the almost
niversal remark, hat a sweet girl she was. Edwarl
did not exactly know what he expected, but he was in
such a mood of hilarity and mischief, that the serants
nll declarel MIaster Fortescue was `' maeed.'' T,
Cnroline their ball was almost always (though uneon-
fessedly) the happiest evening in her year. She knew
se was handsome-Anie Gralme hal told her how
very mnch she would he admircd in London, and that
if she were not hcr very dearcst friend, she should ensy
her beauty terribly. She often in sccret longed pain-
fully for admiration and omage; and, cild as sle still
was in years, yct at her own ouse, and ns MIr.

IIamilton's eltest ughter, in addition to her real
attraetions, she always receiced both in sulticicnt mea-
sure, as to satisfy eten herself. She delighted in those
evenings when it so clncel that ler brothers had
young friends with them, making no hesitation in eon-
fessing that she very much preferred conversing with
boys than with girls, there was so mueh more variety,
morc spirit; nd thogh her mother's heart would
actnally tremble at the fcarful ordeal which an intro-
uction to the pleasures of the world would be to such
a character, still she would not check the open expres-
sion of such sentiments by reproving them as wrong,
and not to be encouraged. She knew, that though
elucation might do much, ery much, it could not
make natural characters all alike; nor, in fact, did she
wish it. She did not grieve and complain that, with
all her efforts, she could not make Caroline give her as
little trouble and anxsiety as Emmeline, nor did she
imagine tht she should see the effcct of her earnest
prayers and cares all at once, or without constant re-
lapses in the cherished object of her cre. She did
all shc could to counteract a tendency which, situated
as she would be when she enterel life, must, without
some strong high pinciple, lead to suffering, and, per-
haps, to sin-for whuat is coquetry? But she indulged
in no iden of security, ncver belieel that beenuse she

if shle failed not in her task, He would briug her joy
at last.
To Emmeline the idea of dancing as quite cnough
to be the acme of enjoyment. The only drawback was,
that in te intervals of rest there was to be a little music,
and though her mother had excused her at MIr. Howard's,
she knew that if anybody expressed a wish to hcar her
nt her own house, play she must; and at those times
she was half sorry she had chosen to learn the larp in-
stead of the piano, as Caroline played so well on the
latter instrument, nobodly vould care to hear her; but the
harp wuas rather a noelty, and no little girl who was
coming played it, and so she was sndly afraid there was
no escape for her, and that was very disagreeable, but
he vould not think about it till the time came; the
dancing to such music as MIr. IIamilton had ordered
from Plymouth was joy eough.
Ellen, though rather afraid of so mnny strangers,
could not resist the general contagion of anticipated
enjoymeut. She did not inleed wake with tho tlought
of thc bll, but with the determination to lear the
verse of the Psalm her aunt had pointed out, and go
and say it to her in her dressing-room before she went
down. And as the first verse was very short, she
learned two, and repeated them without missing a
word, nnd so ass if she quite understood them-that her
aunt was very much pleased and then Ellen could
think of and join her brother's and cousins' delight,
eten though MIrs. IIamilton was obliged to be what
she callel very cruel, but what Ellen knew was very
kind, though it did secem a restraint, and keep her very
quiet all day, instead of letting her run about from

room to room, as Emmeline and Elward, and even
Percy did, for fear of another headache; and so well did
quietness suceceed, that she looked and was unusually
well, and so was almost liely by the eveing.
Just before linner, lercy, who had gone to ride, be-
cause he said he was sure he should get into some scrape
if he did not give a natural vent to his spirits, galloped
bnck in company with a gentlcman, whose presenee
seemed to oecasion him still greater excitement
 WYhere is my mother and is my father at home?''
he asked impatiently, flinging his horse's rein to
Robert, desiring him to take eery care of the gentleman's
horse, as he should not let him leae Oakwood that
night; and then rushing across the hall, threw open
the door of their common sitting-room, and exclaimel-

with very evidcnt plensure, and coming forward with
extenled hand; ``your noisy welcome will not permit

Morton,'' he ndled, adlressing the young clergyman
with that ernest kinness, which always goes to the

replied Ir. lorton, almost sadly; ``it is tle knowledge,
that mingling as often in your home circle as Mr.
Hamilton and my friend Percy desire would wholly
unfit me for the endurance of my loneliness, that keeps
me so aloof, beliese me. Inclination would act a ery
different part, bnt tlere was no resisting such eloquencte
and such happiness as his to-ay,'' he continued, more
gaily
And Mr. Hamilton and Herbert entering as he spoke,
their greeting was qite as warm and eager as Percy's
anl his mother's, and MIr. MIorton gave himself up for
the evening at lenst to enjoyment. His own generous
nature had bcen particularly struck h Percy's manly
conduct with regard to his satire, and diftferent as were
their characters, a warm friendship from tlat moment
commenced beteen them. It was impossible to resist
Perey's warm-heartedness of word and deed; and that
he would sometimes lcae his luxurious home, and stay
two or three days with MIr. MIorton, seeming actually ta
enjoy the rude cottage and its desolate localities, and
spread such a spirit of mirth within and around, that
it was no wonder the afflicted young man looked to his
society as almost his greatest pleasure, especially as he felt
he dared not too often accept Mir. Iamilton's eontinually
proffered initation. Oakwood was the home which
ad been his beau idcal for long years, but which now
seemel whollg unattainable. He felt himself doomel
to solitudc and suffering, and the struggle for contcnt
and cheerfulness wns always more painful after he had
been with his friends.

When all prcparations for the esening were concluded,
even the rcspective toilettes completel, Percy and Em-
meline found it impossible to resist trying the spring,
as they called it, of the onken floors (whence the ear-
pets had been removed), and amused themseles by
waltzing in tle largest circle they could make. The
beautiful suite of rooms were all thrown open, and per-
ceiving Caroline standing by the piano in an adjoining
apartmnent, Perey called out,-
Play us a waltz, Caroline, there's a love; the very
lirelicst you can find. iny nnd I want to try the
boars while we can enjoy them to perfection, that is,
whcn e arc the only persons in the room.''
 You must excuse me, Percy,'' she replied, somewhat
pettishly; I should think you would hae dancing
enough in the course of the evening; and what will
our friends think if they come and find me playing?''
 Think? why that you are ery obliging, which at
present you are not,'' answered Perey, laughing; ``never
mind, Emmy; let us try what our nited lungs will o.''
You may if you likc, Percy, but really I am not
clexer enough to dnnce and sing at the same time-I
should have no breath left,'' was her as joyons vrejoinder.
`Come and dance, Caroline, if you will not play;''
exclauimel Elward, who after decorating his button-hole
with a sprig of holly, seemed seized witl Perey's
lancing mania.
Do give me an opportunity of practising the graces
before I am cnlled upon to display them.''

hrother, very drily; and as Emmcline begged him not
to tease her, he asked-
 WVhat has put her in this ill-humour, Emmy?''
e Oh, I don't know exaetl; but if you let her alone,
she will soon recoer it,''
Well, to please yon, I ill; for you look so pretty
to night, I cannot resist you.''
Iake care, Perey, if you try to turn my head with
such speeches, I shall go to Edward and punish you by
not waltzing with yon,'' sid his little sister, shaking
her head at him with a comic species of reproach.
ThIat's right, kmmy; do not tke fiuttery een from
a brother,'' said her father, coming forward with a smile;
'but will yon not tire yourself by dancing already ?''
Oh no, Papa; I feel as if 1 could dance all night
without stopping.''
Not with me, Emmeline,'' rejoined Perey, shrugging
his shoulders with horror at the ide; ``I should cry
you mercy, before one half the time hnd elapsed,''
 Bt if you are not to be tired, will you not spoil
your dress, and disorder all these flowing curls,'' con-
tinued MIr. Hamilton, ``and surely that will bhe a great
misfortune,''
` Indeed, it will not, Pspa; Perey haes surely too
much regard for me, to wilfully hrt my frock, and if
my hair should be so troublesome ns to get out of order
Fanny will rearrange it in a few minutes,''
If yon wish to cause alarm on that score, my dear
father,'' said ercy, with marked emphasis, ``you mst
go to Caroline not to Emmeline. Thank goodness, I
hae one sister ahoe such petty misfortunes.''
Are you not too hard upon Caroline, Percy?'
268
IIOE INrLUENCE.
Yes, Papa, he is, indeed; do not miud wht he
says,'' answered mmeline, very eagerly; but Perey
said impetuously-
'I am not, kmmeline. I would lay ny wager that
something has gone wong with her lressing to-night,
and so made ler pcttish. He froek is not smart cnough,
or she does not wear the ornaments she wished, or some
sueh thing.''
Caroline had fortunately quittel the music-room, or
this sccch would not hae tended to restore her
serenity; but before Mr, IIamilton could reply, Edward,
who had been to seek llen, burst into the room, ex-
claiming--
Now, Percy, we may have a proper waltz; Aunt
Emmeliue says we may hae just one, before any one
comes, and here she is to play for us, and Ellen for my
partner,'' and they enjoyed it in earnest. MIr. Hamilton
watched them for a few minutes, nnd then went to seek
his elder girl.
She was alone in a little room prepnred for refreshments
tastefully arranging some benutiful flowers in a bouquet.
She looked up as he entered, and so smilel that her
fond fathcr thought Percy must e wrong, for there
certainly seemed no trace of ill-tempcr.
Why are you not with your brothers ad sister in

refuse your brother such a trifling faonr as playing ae

she blushed dcepnly, instantly relied-
`Becausc, Tapa, my temper was not quite restored;

how to time his jokes, or to make sufficient allowanee
for dispositions not exactly like his own; but tell me,
what first occasioned tcmper so to fail that solitude
was necessary.''
Caroline's blush became still deeper, anl she turned
away her head, saying, very hesitatingly-
 For such a very, very silly reason, Fapa, that I d
not like to tell you.''
Nay, my dear, do not fear that I shall either langh
at or reproach ou. If you feel yourself how ery
silly it wss, I am not afrid of its gaining too great
ascendency, even if you fail again,''
'It was only-only-that I was not quite satisfied
with the dress Mamma desired me to wear to-night,
Papa; tat was all, indeed.''
You wishced, perhaps, to wear a smarter one, my
loe,'' replied her father, kissing her gloving cheek so
ffectionately, that the pain of her confession was in-
stantly soothed;  but, indeed, I tliuk Mlamma has
shown a much better taste. It requires more care than
you are yet perhaps asare of, to dress so exactly accord-
ing to our age and station as to do ourselses juastice, and
yet excite no unpleasant feelings in thse of a lower, and
no contempt in those of a higher, gratle. MIany of our
fricnds who are coming to-night eould not afford to

Caroline's noble brow; ``and if amma inquires, tell

child had left no nnkind feeling behind them, and te
manner with hich she receied it made Caroline very
happy, for she lad inwardly feared her ill-temper not
only deserved, but had excited, her mother's displeasure.
Emmeline's look of disnppointment and selfreproach
at her own unusual forgetfulness was so irresistibly
comic, that Percy and Elward burst into an immoderate
fit of laughter, which the former only checked to ask
Caroline where she lad been, and what she had done,
to produce such an extraorinary change for the better
in er appearance in so short a time.

themselves. After to or three quadrilles, the spirit
of enjoyment seemed to rcign alone, not only amongst
the dancers themseles, but een those who sat out and
talked, cither from preference or bceenuse the sets were
full. Percy, his brother, and consin were so actise, sa
universal in their attention and politeness, that all hal
the same measure of enjoment; there was no sitting
lown four or five times consecutiely for any one, and
therefore neither weariness nor dissatisfaction. Where
there is a great desire in the giers of a party to make
every one as hapy as themseles and thoroughly to
enjoy it, they seldom fail to suceeed. And there was
such a variety of amusements in the various rooms that
were thrown open, suitable for all ages-fro the
mammas and papas to the youngest child, that it was
scarcely possible to feel anything but pleasure. Very
many sets had been formed and danced hefore the
Grahame family appeared, anl as Caroline glanced at
her friend anl een her little sister, it required a very
viid recollection of her father's wods to prcvent a
feeling of false shnme, while Annie looked at Emmeline
and eren her faorite Caroliue for a few miuutes with
almost contempt.

looks, the contrast drawn between the manners and
appearance of Lndy Helen's daughters and those of the
IIonorable Mrs. Ilamilton. Lady Helen herself, indeed,

with little partners, and dancing with much more real
delight than tleir sister.
It was scareely possible for any oue, much less a
parent, to look at Caroline that night without admira-
tion. She was so animated, so graceful, so pleasing, and
as such completely tle centre of attraction (nnd really
without any effort on her part) to all tle gentlemen,
young or old in the room. The lads congregated round
her, and it was rather a difficult task to keep clear of
offence, whecn so very many more entreated her to dance
than the length of the eening permitted; but she ma-
naged to talk to all, and yet not to neglect any of her
own sex, for she always refused to dance, if she fancied
her bcing in the quadrille preented any couple who
had not danced so much, and at those times contried
to conciliate five or six instead of only one. Emmeline
took charge of the younger children, often refusing to
dance with older boys, who would have made her much
pleasanter partners, that she might join the little
quadrille, and set them all right.
I am really glad to sec Ellen amongst us to-night,

Grahame really plaed remarkably well, so far as exsecu-

Indeel, my dear Miiss Hamilton, ours excced
hers; no master's heart is in his pupil's progress, as a
mother's in her child's, even should she not teaeh, but

Caroline was sented at the instrment as he spoke,
and there was somcthing in his few vords touching a
right chord; for as she began to play she certainly
thought more of her mother than any one else; and
leterminel, if possible, that otlers should think with MIr.
MIorton, forgetting at the momont that very few, exeept

forcboding stronger than at that moment, as she looked

seemed to express the same as MIarg's. She could

warmly thank her young faorite as she ceased; but
MIary ws more than sntisfied by the fond pressure of

Thia little interruption to the actual husiness of the

dancing recommenced. Eren the call to supper was

The grarity with which he spoke cnaused a general
laugh; bnt Mrs. IIamilton, feeling by the length of time
the fatiguing dance had lasted, there was really some
truth in his words, desired the musicians to stop;
cansing an exclamation of regret and disappointment
from many youthful lips, and Emmeline and Edward
an up to her, to entreat that they might go on a little
longer. MIrs. lIamilton, howeer, refused; and Edward
yielded lirectly, but Emmeline was so much excited,
that obedience was most unusually difficult; and when
her mother desired her to sit down quietly for ten
minutes, and then come to the music-room, as Mrs.
Allan most particularly wished to hear her play before
she left, she answered, with more petulance than she
was at all aware of,-

her heart throb with thankfulness, that her lessons of

 MIrs, Allan would not ask you before, beecause she
knew you did not like to play while the room was so
very full; therefore, ought you not to do your very best
to oblige he?'
Emmeline looked timidly up in her mother's face,
to be quite sure that her displeasure had subsided, as
her words seemed to denote; and quite satisfied, hcr
tears were all checked, and taking MIrs, Allan's offered
hand, she went direetly to the music-room.
MIrs. IIamilton lingerel to lesire Herbert (who had
come up to know the cause of his sister's sudden tears]
to form the last quadrille, and reserve a place, if he
possibly could, for Emmeline, as they would not begiu
till she had done. Her little girl was playing as she
rejoined her, and it really was a pretty pieture, her fniry
figure with her tiny harp, and her swcet face seeming
to espress the real fccling vith which she played. There
was no exeeution in thc simple Highland air, but her
vivid imagination lent it a meaning, and so, when fairly
playing, se did not mind it. MIrs. Allan had lost a
little girl just at mmeline's age, who had also played
the harp, and thcro was something in her caress and
thanks after she had done that made Emmeline stand
quietly at her side, without heeding the praises that
were laished round her. IIerhert at tat moment

 Pray do,'' alded MIrs. Allan, as her son gaily
pleaded his own canse; Emmeline only waited to real
her mother's consent in her eyes, for she thought that
she ought naot to dance any more; and in another
minute the joyous music had resounded, and she was
ancing and clatting as gaily and happily as if there
had been no interruption to her joy.
`' And you will leve all these delights to imprison

The young party no doubt felt that it would bc in-

nnd sought his mother, by eery fond attention on his

Tlis continued for about a fortnight, at the end of

assiuity, and there were o more ebullitions of ill-temper.

Annie Grahne had imparted to her friend, in strict
confidcnce, that her mother intended giring a grand
ball about the end of February, nd meant to entreat
MIr. Hamilton, as a personl faour, to let Cnroline be
present. Cnroline little knew the very slight foundation
Annie hal for this assertion. Lady Helen had merely
said, perlaps she would ask; and this was only said,
because she was too indolent and weak to say  N'' at

Caroline, but simply because she was perfectly certain

The invitations (three weeks' notice) for her parents

of ill-temper.
Now Lady IIelen relly hal asked, though she did

she expected, decidelly refuse. ` Cnroline was much
too young,'' she said, `far such a party. Did she
kuow anything about being aske?'' Lady Helen sail
with truth, that she had not mentioned the subject to
her, and had desired Annie to be equally silent.
MIrs. IIamilton quite forgot that MIiss Grahame was not
famous for obedience, and, relying on her friend's assu-
rance, etermined on not saying anything ta Caroline
about it ; wishing to spare her the pain which she knew
her refusal would inflict. As it happened, it would
have bcen better if she had spoken. The weathier had
preventcd Caroline from seeing Annie, but she was.
quite sure she would not deccive her; and her proud
heart rebelled against her mother, not only for refusing
Lady Helen's request, but for treating her so much like
aA ehild, as to hide that refusal from her. IUnder the

It happened that about this time Mliss Iarcourt left
Oalwood for a week, on a visit to an inalid friend at
bDartmoutl. MIrs. Hamilton had given her full liberty,
promisiug that er pupils should lose nothing by her
absenec. She left ou the Saturday, anud the Thursday
was ILady Helen's ball. On the MIonday, MIr. IIamilton
detained Edward as he was leaing the library, after
morning prayers, and told him that he had received a
letter, which he thought might chance to intcrest him.
Ten minutes aftervards, Ldward rushed into the break-
fast-raom, in a state of suceh joyous excitement that he
could scarcely speak.
Wsh me fie, ten, twenty thousand joys:'' he ex-
elaimed, springing from chair to ehair, as if velocity of
morcmnent should bring back speech. ` In one mouth

MIrs. lIamilton could not speak at the first moment,
for the joy, the animation of her nephew so recalled the
day when her own much-loved brother, her darling
Charles, hadl rushed into her room, to tell her all his
glee, for no one ever listened to and shared in his joys and
troubles as she did. IIe wns then scarcely older than

school-raom, and found the three girls preparing their
books, ``so I must set you all to work, and eee how well
you can get on without me till eleen, when I will rejoin
you. I shll order the carriage at half-past twele, and

old ruin a visit, kEmmy; the morning is so lovely, that
I think we may venture to take our sketch-books, and
see what other part of Berry Pomeroy we can take pen-

Such an anticipation was quite enough for Emmeline.
Her dance about the room as only checked by the
idea that er lessons would neer be ready, nor her ex-
ercises and sums done, unless she asat quietly down, and
so, with n great effort, she gave all her attention to her
various tasks, and mastered them even before her motler
returned. Ellcn, though she tried quite as mnuch, was
not so suecessful. The Prince William would sail in
miniature on her slate, over all her figures. The recol-
lcction of the awful storm they had encountered on theiz
oyge to England would retnrn so vividly, that the
ery room seemed to heae. And then-but she could
not make out whyshe thould think abont that then,-her
mother' s eath-bed came before hcr, and her promise, and
it seemed harder still to part with Edward, from a vagu
dread that came oer her, but still she tried to attend

her to refer to, instead of lepending entirely on her

French; but fuur tiimes was that tormenting sum re-
turned, till at last her tears effaced the figures as fast as
they were written. Still, patience and resolution in
both teacher and pupil conquered, and the fifth time
there was not a figure wrong; and MIrs. Ilamilton, fondly
putting back the heasy ringlets which in Ellen's absorbedl
attention had fuallen oer her teaeful cleeks, said, play-

Shall I tell you a secret, my little Ellen? I was
quite as disinclined to be firm this morning as you were
to be patient; so you see we have both gaincd a grand
victory. Iy conjuring propensities, as Emmy thinks
thcm, told me that you had real cause for some little
inattention, and, therefore, that it wns very erutel in me
to be so determined; but my iudgent would tell me

Ellen was so glad, that she felt almost happy, and her
few. other uties were done quite briskly, for MIrs.
lIlamilton had been so kind as to coutermand the car-
riage till one, that she and Caroline might have tie to
finish. But Caroline, if she had not triel hefore, was
ow still less capable of doing so. Eery word of kind-
ness addressed to Ellen inereased the storm raging
within, and the difficulty of restraining it in MIrs.
Hamiltaon's presence caused it to burst forth with un-
mitigated iolence the moment she quitted the apart-
ment, desiring Emmeline and Ellen to make haste, and
put away their books, but still without taking the least
otice of her. Inectirce, reproach, almost abuse, were
poured against Ellen, who stood actually frightened at
the riolenee sle had so very innocently excite, and at
the fearful and deforming passion which inflamed her
cousin's every feature. Caroline's anger ad miscounted
time, or sle must have known that ler mother could
not hare gone far enough, for such unusual tones of
exeitement to cscape her quick hearing. MIrs, Hamilton,
startled and alarmed, returned directly, and so iidly

misgnidedt sister in those uncontrolled fits of fry, under
which she had so often trembled, thnt present disappoint-
ment, and dread for the futnre, took possession of her,
and for tle roment rendered her powerless. Caroline was
too much engrossed to perceive ler at first, and she hadt,
therefore, time to rally from the momentary weakness.

Wat does this mean 7'' she exclaimed, fixing her
ees on Caroline, witl that expression of quiet but stern
reproof, which, when she dil nse-and it as rery
seldom-had the power of snbdning even the wildest
excitement. e What has Ellen done, that you should
abuse her with this unjust and cruel and most unfemiuine
violenee? You hae indulged your ill-temper till you do
not knaw what you say or do, and you are venting on
another the nnger which my displeasure has caused you
to feel towards me, and towards yourself. I lesire that
you will control it directly, or retire to your owu room,
till you cuan behave with some degree of propricty, and
not disturb the comfort and happiness of otlers in
this most uncalled-for manner.''
I will not go,'' answered Caroline, bursting into
violent tears, and scarcely aware of what she was saying.
I know I dislike Ellen, and I hae reason to dislike
her, for hefore she came, you were never so often dis-
pleased with me; you are always kind and indulgent ta
her, always treat her as a reasonable being, not as the
child, the infant yo think me. I know you hare lost

Mrs. HIamilton snid, as she ealmly turne for a moment
to Emmeline and Ellen, who both stood hewildcred, the
former from actual terror, that her sister should dare sa

be disppointed of our promised ramble. Do not think
anything of what this unhappy girl is sying; at present,
she scnrcely knows herself, aad will by-and-by wisl it
recalled, far more intensely than ever we can.''
Emmeline longed to throw her arms round her mother,
and with tears bteseech her to forget what Caroline had
said; but, though Mrs. Hamilton had spoken cheerfully,
and in quite her sual tone of vcice to them, there was
something in her countenance, that cehecked any display
of softnes even in her affectionate child ; something that
almost awed her, and she left the room with Ellen to
prepare for the promised excursion, wlich had, however,
lost all its asnticipated enjoyment from the uneontrolled
temper of another.
Now, Caroline, I will answer you,'' snid Mrs.
IIamilton, as soon as they were alone, and again regard-
ing Caroline, who was sobbing violently, with that snme
searching look.  Your charges are such very heavy ones,
that I renlly must request you during my absence to
arrange and define them in some order. I am so per-
fectly ignorant of having given yon any foundation for
them, that, hefore I can attempt defence, you must
inform me exactly and definitely of what you complain.
That this morning my manner was kinder to Ellen thnn

unhappy, it was from your own fearful temper, which
by eneouragement has blackened eery thing around

command, Caroline, diasregard or evasion of which will
be disobedience.''
She left the room, and in a very slort time afterwards
Caroline heard the carriage lrive off; hut for ncarly
three long hours she neer moved from her seat, s
utterly miserable, as scarccly eveu to change her position.
Neer in her life hefore, not in her most angry moments,
had she so spokeu to her mothcr, and her remorse was
almost intolerable. Again and agin she remembered
what MIrs. Hamilton had told her so often, that, if she
lil not strive nnd pray against the doinion of ill-tem-
per while young, it would become more and more un-
cantrollablce, and the older she became, the more iflieult
to suhduc, even in a moderate degree, and her words
were indeed true. It had been many months since
temper had gained such an ascendeney, and its effeets
were far, far more violent, and its power oer her more
determined, and if, as she grew older, it shonll be still
worse, what would become of her? how insufferablg
wetchel. wat would she not e giren to hare re-
callel her words?' The jealousy which had arisen, no
she knew not how, had sunk into air before those fe
calm inquiring sentenccs fom her mother, and in her
excessive misery every kind deed and worl and look,
every fond inlulgence and forbcaranee, in fact, all tia
love her mother hal so lavished on her from hcr infancy,
rushed back upon huer, till she actually hated herself,
and longed the more intensely for the comfort of that
soothing affection, which, in real pnin or childish sorrow,
had never hcen refused her.

of many joyous oices and the dressing-bell pro-
claimed the rceturn of the various memhers of her
family only in time to prepare for dinner.  It was
all, all from that; I know now, onl from that one
thonght-one wish. Why was I such a fool, as not
to tell MIamma at once that I knew I was to be asked,
and wished so much to go?-if she had refused me, it
would not hate been half the pain I have made for
myself. And ho can I meet Papa's eye and Percy's
unkind jokes wvith eyes like these?'' she added, as,
on rising to go to her own room, she cught sight of
her own face in n mirror, and ctually startled at the
disfigurement, which the violence of her emotion had
wrought. Oh, how I wish MIamma bad ot desired
me to go to her; that I conld but hide myself from
everybody-or get rid of tis lorrible hlaek clond,''
From etery eye but her mother's she could nnd did
hide herself; for saying that her head ached, which
was the truth, and she did not wish anything to take,
she refused to go down to dinner. MIrs. lHIamilton had
sueeessfully exerted herself dring their excursion, and
Emmeline and Ellen enjoyed themselves so thoroughly
as almost to forget the alloy of the morning; and even
when Caroline's message recalled it, the boys were all
so merry, that it did not disturb them. Percy always
declared that Caroliue's headache was only another
term for temper-nche, nnd he would certainly hnre sent
her sone message of mock pity, if his quick eye had
not discovered or fancicd that his mother did not look
quite as vell as usual, and so he contentel himself by
trying still more to he the life of the dinner-tale. Mlr,

IIamilton hnd seen at a single glance that all was not
quite right, and Caroline's non-appearnce and message
exsplained it, to his extreme regret, for he had begun to
hope and believe that his wife's extreme solicitude, on
her aecount, was heginiug to decrease,
MIrs. IIamilton had not much doubt that silence and
solitude hat so far had effeet on Caroline as to subdue
passion, and bring her to a sense of her misconduct;
but that ad scnrcely power to lessen the anxiety and
the pain which Caroline's words had so wantonly in-
flicted. IIal she indeed evinced anything like undue
partiality -the ide alone almost brought a smile;
fondly, and almost as her own child, ns she loved her
little niece. The very anxicty Caroline oeeasioned her
cepened her aflection; the rery control she was
obliged to exercise in her mode of guiding her, strength
ened every feeling towards her. She was so enwrapped in
these painfully engrossing thoughts, in the atriet exs-
amination of her own heart, that she was naot aware the
time shve had appointed had passed by full ten minutes,
till she was rauscd by the handle of her door being
softly turned, nd left agnin, as if some one had wished to
enter, but hesitated. The very hesitation gne her
hope, for she really did not kow that the utmost
penalty she could have inflicted on Cnroline, in the
moment of natural indignation, would have failed in
producing sueh an etffect as the simple command to
seek her, and define her chargcs against her, when that

Mrs. HIamilton looked at her changed aspeet, the bitter
humiliation expressed in eery feature, with such pity,
that it required een more than her usunl exerciase of
control, to retain the grave and apparently unmoved
tone with which she said-
You have had a long time in which to refleet on
your charges against me, Caroline. I hope they are
now sufficiently defined for me to understand and answer
them. You may sit down, for you do not seem ery

Caroline glailly obeyed, by sitting down on a low
ottoman, soe little distance from her mother, on whose
neck she absolutcly laonged to throw herself and heseech
forgiveness; btt MIrs. IIamilton's tone wns not sch as
to gie her courage to do so. She remaincd silent,
burying her face in her hands.
I am waiting your pleasure, Caroline; I shoull hase

further, than by requesting you to explain clearly the
origin of your complaint against me. Its main ground
of offence is, I beliere, that since Ellen as become a

harshness and unkindness than I ever did before. Cuan

when ill-temper regains ascendeney. You need not

Caroline tried to speak, but she could only soh forth,
that she could not recall one instance, in which her
mother hd been more displeased with her than ler
conduct merited. Acknowledging, but almost inarti-

Caroline, with returning temper.
 Perhaps not, for some persons are so physically
constituted that they do not know what fear is; and
harslness would harden, not terrify and crush, as with
such dispositions as Ellen's. But Caroline, wen temper
gains dominion oer you, as it has done to-day, do
you always think and utter nothing but the truth?''
Caroline turned from that penetrating look and burst
iuto tears. Few ns tle words were, they seemed to
flash light iuto the very inmost recesses of her heart,
and tell her, that in her moments of uncontrolled
temper, in hcr roodiug fncies, she really did forfeit
the truth, an adherence to which she so prided lerself;
and tht there was no excuse for her in the idea that
she did not know what she said or did-for why had

it acquired such fearful dominion.

that its very first approach woult so startle you, that
you would use every energy to suhdue it. IInut I fenr,
Caroline, it is only when temper has made you miserable,
ns it has to-lay, that you are quite aware of its enormity.
You do not think the fault grcat enough to dcmnd the
watchfulness and care, without which it never will be
subdlued'
1 nm afraid I do not indeed, MIamma. I know I do
not make it a suhject of praycr, as you have so often
advised me, except when ererything looks so black,
and I am so miserahle; anl then, I icnr, I ask more
to be happy again, thn for forgiveness of my sin,
and for grace nnd strength to overcome it. I nerer felt
this to he the case so strongly as to-day, bt your cold-

I never thought I was so icked, and so I must bc

MIrs. IInmilton involuntarily drew her chill more
closely to hor. The humility, the bitterness of self-
repranch, was so unlike Caroline's usual haughtiness-
so vcry much deeper thn they had eer been hefore,
that she hoped, in spite of her nxicty, and her oice

you promise me to try this plan, Caroline?''
Caroline could not reply, for eery kind word her
mother spoke seemed to heighten self-reproaeh, and
make her still more wretched. MIrs. Hamilton felt that
there was no refusal in her silence, and continued talk-
ing to her in that same gentle strain a little while
longer, and then rose to lease her,-but Caroline looked
so snrrowful, that sle hesitated.
 No, Mlamma; I lo not desere that you should stay

you to remain idle thc remainder of this evening than
to employ yourself, even with the most disagreeable
task, I would much rather you should do so. Once let
temper be quite subdued, and our heart receive
its necessary gorernment, and I hae no fear but that
you will very quickly make up for lost time; and even
if rou did not, beliee me, my dear child, the gracee of
the mind, precious as in general they are considetd,
and as they are, still are to me actually nothing worth,

heart. Do not shrink from the suffering which it will
be to sit alone and think on all that has pssed to-lay;
but let your remorse e accompanied by a reolution
(which you are quite capable of not only forming, but of
keeping) not to rest till by prayer and effort you have
sought God's blessing on your diticult task, and so feel
strengthened for its fulfilment; and also for persevering
in it, for you must not hope to suceeed in subduing
yourslfall at once. Do this, and I shall be hetter pleased

attempt to escape; though, hal it not been for her

naot be so cruel, if she were not well, her spirit was so

LY HELE's ball took plaee; and Caroline had so
conquerel herself, that she could listen to Pere's flow-
ing account of its delights with actual cheerfulness. It
was so associated with self-reproaeh, that she could
scarcely think of it without pain; but sle was so con-
vinced of her folly in permitting such a very little thing
so to affect her temper as to cuause nll the misery she had
endured, that she had resolved to punish herself, not
only hy listening to Perey, but by herself inquiring the
details. She wss a girl of really a strong mind, and
onee coninced of error, once released from the fell
dominion of temper, she did not care what pain she en-
dured, or what iiiculty she encountered, so that she
could but convincee her mother how truly she regretted,
anl triet to atone for past misconduct. It was very
ensy, as Irs. IIamilton had told her, to regin lost time
in her studies, but not quite so casy to check the cross
word or unkind thought, and to brenk fro the black
cloud that still at times would envelop her. But she
dil not gie way, constantly eren making opportunities
for self-denial, and duing little kindnesses for Ellen,
tlough she was too truthful to profess an affection which
as yet she could not feel.

wife hesitatet; but she went at once to Caroline, who
chancved to be reading alone in the schoolroom, for it
was the time of recreation, and told her. For a moment
her countenance was aetually raliaut with delight, the
next it clouded over.

exercise that moring, that se had desired her to write
it again. It was sery diflicult, nnd had materially
shortened tle time which she had promised to deote to
Edward, who as this week released from is attendance
on MI. Howard, to permit him and Ellen to be as much
togethcr as possible. llurried by lim, she left her book
opcn on the table to dry, and, fiuding it closed on her
return, put it avay, without looking at it. Le following
lay Mliss Harcourt, of course, requested to see it, and,
to Ellen's utter astonishment, her exercise was not there;
only the faulty and hlottel theme, with no sigu to ex-
plain its disappearance. Now we know MIiss HIarcourt
was rather prejudiced against Ellen, and, as she had un-
bappily failed in truth more tlan oce--pehaps she
was not so unjust aud harsh as poor llen felt er to
be-she refused to beliese her assurance tlat se lad
writtcn it. No one had been iu the schoolroom at the

obeyed or leceived, of course her word would bc

Tlat you have failed again, both in obedience and
truth, Ellen, lI cuannot for a moment douht, and it cer-

tempt. I shall certainly, after this week, warn her not
to trust too implicitly in your artful professions of re-
pentanee,''
Poor Ellen felt too hewillered and too miserable even
to ery. That she had written her exercise, she was as
positive as that she had been told to lo so; but if she
had-what hat hecomc of it? IIarsh as Miss IIarcourt
seemed, appearances ere certainly very much agaist
her. She had not a single proof that she had obeyed,
and her word was nothing; even Emmeline lookel at
her doubtingly, and as if she could scarcely een pity
her. It was very little comfort to think her aunt was
not to be told. IIcr own impuise was to go to her, and
tell her at oncee; but how could she be believed? and
MIrs. Hamilton's words eIf I oter discover another
untruth, you will compel me to adopt still severer
measures, pain as it will be to myselt,'' the remembrance
of all she had suffered, the disappointment it would be
to her aunt, to think all she had said and read to her
were forgotten, when in reality she was constantly think-
ing of and trying to act on them, all checked the im-
pulse, and terrified her into sileuce.
Mliss IIarcourt was not an acute physiognomist; she
eould only read in Ellen's face hardihood and reckless-
ness. We rather think MIrs. Hamilton wonld have read
something very different; but she was very much
engnged wvith Edward, anl if she lid think llen looked
much more out of spirits, she attributed it to natural
feeling at the rapid approach of tle day of separation.

least, though every night, that told her another dny had
gone, and brought before her all sorts of vague fcelings
and fancies of dreal, she either cried herself to sleep, or
laid awake, still more unhappy. The suspicion attaehed
to her seemed to double tle seeritr of the trial of
parting. Eward was her own; Edward must love her,
with all her faults; but esen her aunt, her denr, kind,
good aunt, must cease to hae any affection for her, if so
eonstantly believed guilty of a sin so terrihle as Ialse-
hood. And she seemed to love her brother still more
than eer, every day thst brought the hour of parting
nearer-seometimes as il she could ot bear the pain of
ot being ahle to Iook at his bright face and listen to
his glad laugh and dear voice fr thnree, perhaps six
long years. IlIer unt's geutle kindness seemed to in-
crease her unhappiness, for though she knew she was
innoeent, still she felt, if MIiss IIarcourt hal told MIrs.
Hamilton, she conld not be so caressed and cared for,
and she was receivig that which she was belieed to hae
forfeited. MIiss IIarcourt's face certainly seemed to ask
her as distinctly as sords, how she could be so nrtful,
so tdeceitful as to permit her aunt to take such notice
of her; and so she often shrunk awa, when she most
longed to sit by and listen to her.
Edward's spirits never sobered, except now and then,
when he thought of leaving Mlrs. IIamilton, to whom he
had gisen the same love he had lavished on his mother,
perhaps to a still greater extent, for reverence was
Iargely mingled with it. Mr, IIoward, too, was unother
whom he grieed to leave, and MIrs. lIamilton so trusted
in these apparently strong affections anl his good dis-
position, as to feel but litle anxiety; merely sorrow that

Ellen's manner on the MIonday evening anoyed and
prejudieed Miss Harcourt still more; MIrs. Greville and
Mary, Lady Helen and all her family, bringing Caroline
home with them, MIr. Howard, and some of Edward's
favorite companions, all assembled at Oakwood, and
eery one was determined to be gay and cheerful, and
Edward's voice was the merriest, and his laugh the
happiest there; and Ellen, though her head aehel with
the effort and the constant struggle of the preeeding
week, was quite cheerful too, and talked to Mary
Greville, and Lilla and Cecil Grahame, and een to MIr.
Howard, ns MIiss IHarcourt felt she had uo right ta

She had never in her whole life felt so disinclined to
sing, so as if it were quite impossible; as if she must
cry, if she did; but kdward would think it so unkindl
if she refused, for she did not know herself why his
ery words should hae increased the difficulty, and
what reason could she give him? MIary went, and asked
Mrs. lIamilton to aceompany her; and Ellen did her

sorry she had pressed it so much, and Edward hal
thanked hcr, and told her he should sing it in idea very
often. She tried to be merry again, but she cold not
succeed as before, and so she kept as near her aunt as
she could all the renainder of the evening, as if she
were only safe there.
Eward, too, had a hard battle with himself, as one
by one his favorite companions took leve of im witha

resolvel he would not disgraee it; therefore he only
returned MIr. Howar's embrace very warmly, and ran
out of thc room. But wlen his ant went into his
room an hour afterwards, it appeared as if he had put
off his pride and his uniform together, for, though he
was fast asleep, his pillow was quite wet with tears.
The next morning was a ery sad one, though Percy
and his father did all they could to make it cheerful-
(wve ought to have said before that Perey and Ilerhert

one of the serrants, who, when the carriage was ready
at eleven o'clock, thronged into the hll to take a
last look at him. He was o alterel, that he had that

My dear Ellen, I ae been looking for you every-

mean disbclief and condemnation, remained quiet and
trembling by her side.

Ellen has been tclling me that you hae been very
much lispleased with her, my dear Lucy,'' MIrs. IIamil-
ton said, direetly she entered, addressing Mliss llareourt,
who was sitting reading with Caroline and Emmeline,
``and certainly with great apparent justice; hut sle is so
unhappy ahout it, that I can scarcely helieve that she
has forgotten all which pasaed etween us a short time
ago, and I am goig therefore, with your permission, to
try if I cannot discove something that may throw a
light on the subject.''
I am afraid that will scarcely be possible,'' replied
Miss IIareourt; ` however, I am glad she has hal the
candour to tell you, instead of continuing to receive yor
notice as she has done the last week,' Ellen had
broght her book while Miss IInrcourt nas speaking,
and Is. IIamilton attentively examined it.
Di you not begin one like this the same day,
Caroline?'
 Yes, MIamma; don't you remember we were obliged
to send to IIarris for them? as te parcel with the
stationery did not come from Ereter as snon as we ex-
pected. And we noticed how much thinner they were,
though they were the same sized books.''

have been only the quality of the paper wich made th

Caroline, siling. `I il not think ou were taking the
least uotce of us, but I do remember saying so now,
and indeed, I ery often wish the quality had been the
same, for our writing looks horrid.'
Do yaou bappen to remember the number of leaves
they contained, anl if they were both alike''
t'I know they had both the same number, and I
think it was two and twenty, but I cnn tell you in a
moment.'' And with her usual quickness of movement
Caroline unlockd her desk, drew forth her book, and
ran oer the leaves.
I am right, two and twenty,''
And you are quite sunre they had both the same
numbser ?''
Perfectly certain, Mamma.'
 Then, by some incomprelensible means, two lcases
hae anished from Ellen's-here are only twenty.
Hae you ever torn a leaf out, Ellcn ?''
No, Aunt, indeed I hae not.''
 When lid Mliss IHarcourt tell you to write this miss-
ing exercise?''
``Last MlIonday week-I mean yesterday week.''
Where id you write it, and what id you do with
your book afterwards?''
I wote it at this table, Aunt: I was so sorry I
had to do it, when Edward epended so much on my
geig out with him, that I thought it would sare time
not to get my desk; and as soon as it was done, I left
it open to dry. When I came home it was closed, and
I put it away withont looking at it, and the nexst morn-
ing the exercise was not there.''

id you notice Ellen's book open as she said2 Why,
what is the matter, my deuar?'' she alded, obserng
that Caroline loked as if some sudden light had flashed
upon her, and then, really griesed.
:tI am so very, very sorry, Iamma; I do helieve it
has been all my haste and carelessness that has caused
Ellen all this unhappiness. I was in such a lurry to
copy the poem for Lady Ilelen, tht I tore a blank leaf
out of an open book on the table, without thinking
whose it was. In my haste the book fell to the ground,
I pickel it up to write on it, but never noticed if the
fellow-leaf fell out, which it must hae done, and no
loubt Fanny carried it away with some other torn papers,
which she asked me if she were to destroy. I am more
sorry than I can tell you, Ellen; pray believe that I did
not do it purposely,''
1am sure she will, if it be only for the comfort of our
knowing the truth,'' said Mrs. Hamilton, truly relicsed,
not only from the explanation, but perceiving Cnaroline's
voluntarily offered kiss was willingly nnd heartilyreturned
by Ellen. It was almost the first she hal ever seen
exchanged between them.
I must believe you, dear Caroline, for you neer
say what you do not mean,'' sasil Ellen, earnestly;
 but I lo so wish Miss IIarcourt could see my exercise;
she would quite believe me then,.''

 Yes, MIadam.''
And were they all torn up in small pieces ?''
ee No, Madam; there was one like the page out of a
book, which made me ask MIiss IIamilton if they wcere
all to he destroed. It was such a nice clean piece,
only being written on one side, that I wrappel up some
lace in it-Mrs. Ellis aing only half an hour before
scolded me for not keeping it more carefull,''
 Bring me the lea, my geod girl, and Miss Ellen
will gire you a still better piece for the purpose,''
replied her mistress, quite unable to suppress a smile,
and Ellen hastily took out a large sheet of writing
paper, and the moment Fnny returned (she seemed
gone an age) gae it to her, and seized her own, which
she placed in her annt's hand, without being ahle to
speak a single word.

stopped there, hut she could not help adding, ``you

so very clever, that I shall tell Percy I am a better

You don't seem very ceapable of doing anything but

You have cried yourself almost ill, and so must bear

Emmeline, quite proul of tle charge, and more grieved
than she very well kne how to express, till she was
quite alone with Ellen, that she, too, had suspected and
been cold to her the lat week, left the room with her
cousin. Caroline seemed to lesitate a moment, but
she vas qite certnin by her mother's face that she
wished to speak to 3liss lIarcourt, and so, without bcing

And now, Iucy, I am going to ask you a personal

 You hnve not qite guessed it, Lucy. Appearancee

I should have done so myself; but the favour I am
going to ask you, is merely that you will try and neer
shoe that yo douht her word, or refer to her past
failures, I am quite convinced that nntruthl is not
Ellen's natural disposition, but that it has been cansed
by the same eircumstances which iave made her such
a painfully timid, too humble, character. lf with all her
efforts to conquer herself, she still finds her word

as you please, and as I am sure she will desire, if
necessary-as she did to-dny-but oblige me, and never
donht her. If she finls we never do, it will raise her
self-esteem, and give her a still further incentive to ad-
here as strictly to the trutl, as she sees we believe she
does. I am certain the habit of falsehood has often
heen strengthened by the injudicious and crel references
to one or two childisl failures. If I am neser to be
belicved, what is the use of trying to tell the truth? is
the very natural question, and the present pnin of eare-
fulness being gceater thau tho visible amount of cil,
the habit is confirmel. Will you oblige me ?''

The lay passed mnch more happily than the morn-
ing could hae anticipated. Emmeline's nursing was
ao alfectionate and successful, that Ellen was quite able
to join them at diuner, and her aunt had selecte such
a very interesting story to read aloul, in which one

hard one, that her aunt promised her she should in

CHAPTER I.
ADVNCE D ETosECT.
OcR readers must imagine that two years and four
montls hae elapsed since our last visit to the inmates
of Oakwood. It was the first week in MIarch that
Edward Fortescue (only wanting ten days for the com-
pletion of his fourteenth ea) quitted a home, which
was happier than any he had eer known, to cnter the
world ns a sailor; and it is the 7th of June, two
years later, the day on wlich lllen Fortescue com-
pletes her fifteenth year, that we recommence our
narTtie.
Oer this interral, however, much as we are anxious
to proceed, we must take a brief glance, clearly to
understanul the aspect of the Oakood home affairs,
which, from the increasing age of the younger members,
had unudergone some slight change. Tle greatest and
most keenly felt was the departure of Perey and
Herbert for college, the Octohor tclemonth after
Edward had gone: the house seemed actually desolatc
without them. Percy's wild jokes and incxshaustible

spirits, and IIobert's quiet unobtrusive kindness, much
as they had always been truly appreciated by their home
circle, still scarcely scemcd to have bccn fully felte till tlhc
yoing mnen were gonc; and the old house actually
scemed cnwappcd in a silence, which it requircd very
determined eflort on the part of all who rcmained in
thc lcast degree to dispel.
Our rcaders who arc mothers, and earnest ones, will
easily understand the anxious tremblings of MIrs.
IIamiltan's heart when slhe parted fom her hoys for
the worll; for such, to spirits fresh, boyish, uusophis-
ticatcd, as they still were, Oxsford could not fail to be.
For Ierbert, indeed, she had ucither fenr nor doubt;-
no snecr, no temptation, no bad example, would aflect
him, in whom cvery passing year seemed to increase and
deepen those exalted fcelings which in his earlicst
chilhood, had less in them of earth than heavcn.''
His picty was so real, his faith so ferent, his atlections
so concentrated in his home and in one other indiyi-
ual, his love and pursuit of study so ardent and uneeas-
ing, his one aim to bccomc worthiy in heart and nind to
serve God as his mninister so ever present, that he was ef-
fectually guardcd een from thc world. Percy hadnone
of thcse fecelings to tle same extent, save his ardent love
for home and its inmates-is mothecr, above all. He
did, indced, gie evey promise thnt tlce principles so
carefully instilled had taken firm root, and would guide
his conduct in the world; but hMIrs. lInmilton was too
humble-minded-too coninced-that every human
effort is imperfect, without te sustainiug and vitnlizing
grace of God, to rest in security, as many might hase

done, that heeuse she had so orked, so prayed, sle
uust succced. She was hopeful, indeed, ery hopeful-
how ceould she be otherwise when she bcheld his deep,
though silent, reverence for sacred things-his constant
and increasing rcspect and loefor his fater-his devoted
affection for herself-his attachment to IIcrbcrt, which
seemed so strangely yet so benutifully to combine almost
reverence for his superior mind and holier spirit, with
tle earessing proteetiveness of an elder for a younger-
a stronger for a wcake? Thore was much in all this
to banish anxiety altogether, but not from such a heart
as MIrs. IIamilton's; whose very multiplicity of blessings
made her often tremble, and led her to the footstool of
her God, with a piety as humblc, as constant, as fervent,
as many beliere is the fruit of adersity alone.
Caroline had sufficiently improved as greatly to
decrease solicitude on her aecount; though there was
still n want of sufficiont humilit, a too great proneness
to trust implicitl in her own strength, an inclination
to prejudice, and a loe of admiration, which all
ade MIrs. Hamilton fear would cexspose her to some
personal sorrow ere they were entirely ovcrcome. To
produce eterual good, she mightnot murmur at tcmporal
suflering; but her fond heart, though it could anticipate
it calmly for lerself, so shrunk from it, as toucling her
clild, that the nearer approached the pcriod of
Caroline's introduction to the gay world, the more
painfully anxions shc became, and the more gladly
would she have retained her in the retirement of
Oakwood, where all her better and higher qualitics
alone ad play. lut sle knew this could uot be; and

as groundless with Caroline, as every letter from

nvert it by nevcr wavering in her watchful and guiding
lore,
Emmcline, nt fiftcen, was just the snme sportive,
happy, innocent child, as she hnd bcen at twelse. HIer
feelings were, indeed, still deeper, her imagination
mnorc vivid, her religion more feryid. lo her eery-
thing was toucled with poetry-it matterel not how
lull and comnonplace it might seem to other peoplc;
but MIrs. IInmilton's julicious cre had so tanght that
Trnthl alone wns poetry and bent-the Ideal only
loveable when its basis was the Real,-that she was
neither romatic nor visionary. een ns her sensi-
bilitics were, even oer a worl of fietion, they
prompted the deed and act of kindness, not the tenr
alone. For miles round her fathcr's large domins sle
was known, loved, so felt as a guardian spirit, that the
very soud of her step seemed to promiee joy. She
actually seemed to lie tor others-making their
plcasures hers; and, withal, so joyous, espccially in her
own home and ant Greville MIanor, that even anxiety
seemned exorcised when she was ncnr. Iefore strangers,
indeed, she would be shy ns a young fawn; though
eren then natural lindliness of hcnrt prompted suci
kindness of word and mamer, as always to excite the
wish to sce her again.

had been away, had only once occasioned anxiecty.
Two or three months after he had sailed he wrote home

in the highcst terms of n ccrtain Gilbert IInrdiag, one
of thc secnior midslipen of his ship, fom whom he
had receivsed kindness upon kindness; and who, being
six or seven years oldor than himself, he jestingly wrotec
to lis aunt and uncle, must certainly be the very best
friend he could have chosen, as he was mch too old to
lcad himn into mischiof. Why hc (Harding) had taken
such a fancy to him, Edard could not tell; but he was
so excessiely kind, so taught him his duty, and
smootle all the difficulties and disagrecables which,
he owned, had at first sccmed overwhelming, that he
neser conld be gratefl enough. He added, that,
though not a general fasorite ith his immediate
messmates, he was very lighly esteemed by Sir Edward
Mnly and his other superior officers, and that the
former had much commended him for his kindness ta
the youngcst boy on bonrd, whieh Edward was. It
was ery easy to perceive that young Fortescue's
susceptible afficctions had all been not only attracted, but
already rireted by this new friend. All the young
party at Oakwood rejoiced at it; Mrs. Hamilton would
hae done so, also, had she not perecived an anxious
cxpression on her husband's face which alarmed ler.
He did not, howeer, make any remark till he had
spokcen to MIr. Iloward, snnd then imparted to is wite

Iloward had had less hopc for him than for ny of the
others. This opinion had ecen borne out by his after
conduct at home; but that the affair had been suc-
cessfully hushed up by his family, and by immense
interest he had ben permitted to cnter the nay, where,
it was said, his youthful errors had been so redecmed,
and his courage and condnct altogether hnd so won him

1Ir. IIownrd alone retained his opinion that the disposi-
tion wns naturally bad, and doubted the interual responsc
to the seeming outward good and he was grieved and
anxious beyond measure, when he henrd that he was
not only on ord the same slip as lEward, but already
his favorite eompanion and most trusted friend. Iis
anxsiety, of course, extended itself to Mr. anl MIrs,

successfully obserant, should fail in penetration when

Edward's life ate Oakwood had been so very hapy,
its pleasures and indulgences so innocent, so ntmerous,
that he did not himself know his liability to temptation,
from the exseessive love of pleasnre which his mother's
indisereet indulgence had originally infused. Ie con-
trol which his uncle and MIr. IIoward exercised oer
him, had been so rery gentle nnd forbearig, that he
had scarcely eer felt the inclination to cxert self-vill,
nnd hen it so chanced that he had, Ellen had covered
is fault, or borne its penalty for him. IIe thought he
had guidel himself, when in fact he was guided; bnt
this could no longer be the cnse when one of the little
world which thronged a first-rate man-of-ar. Outward
actions were, indeecd, under control ; but what captain,
the most earnest, most able in tle world, conld look
into and guide the learts of all tlosc committed to lis
care? And almost tle first action of Edward's unbiassed
will was indignantly to tear into shreds, and scatter t6
the winds and waves, those affectionate nnd warning
letters, and cling the closer to, rest the more con-
fidingly on, IIarding, for the wrong that he tlonght he
had done him, by allowing his cye even to rest for a

IOMIE INPLUENCE.
When MIrs. IIamilton told Ellen that her letters to
her brotler, and his to her, should never be subjected
to auy scrutiny hut thcir own, shc acted on a rineiple
which many parcnts and guarlians would consider as
high-llown and romantic, and whicl she hersclf had
most painful rcason to regrct-the eftects, nt lenst, but
not the principle itself, for that was bascl on too refined
n feeling to waver, cven though she sufferel from it.
She could not bear, nor could her husband, the system
which prevailed in some fnmilies of their acquaiultance,
that their children could ncither receive nor write letters
to each other, or thcir intimate friends, without bcing
shown to their seuiors. As for opening and reading a
letter directel to one of them, before its possessor saw
it, as they had seen done, it was, in their cstimation, as
much dishonour and as mean, as if sucl a thing had
bcen done to an adult. Perfeet confidence in their
home they had indced instillcd, and that confidence
was noever withheld. lhere was a degrce of suspicion
attached to a demand always to sce whuat a clild had
writtcn or received, from whieh Mrs. IInmilton's
pure mind actually shrunk in loathing. In the many
months the Grahame family passed in lLondon, Annie
and Caroline corresponded without the least restraint:
no doubt many would pronounce Mrs. lIamilton very
unwise, knowing Amnie so well, and trcmbling for
Cnroline as she did; but as she tald MIiss lIarcourt,
she had some notions peeculiar to herself (they always
had the sanction and sympathy of her husband, low-
cer), and this was one of them. She was always

her, either from their own epistles or those they re-
ceived, and if they wished it, read them herself, btt she
neer asked to do so, aud the consequence was, that
the most perfect confidence was given.
When Ellen and Edward prted, they werc both so
young, that MIr. Ilamilton had hesitated as to whether
his wife was quite justified in the perfect trust with
wich she treated them, and whether it would not be
wiser to overlook their correspondence; but MIrs.
IInmilton so argued that their very yonth was their
safeguard, that they were all in nll to each other, and
as sucl sle wished them to feel they were bound by
even a closer and fonder tie than that of brother and
sister under other circumstances, so on over her
husbnand, that he yielded; and from the long extracts
that Ellen would read of Edward's letters to the furily
in general, and of her own to her aunt, he was quite
satisfied as to thc wisdom of his wife's judgment.
For full a year after Edward's departure, kEllen's
conduct and gencral improvement had given her aunt
nothing but pleasure; even Miss Harcourt's and Caro-
line's prejudiee was nearly removed, though, at times,
the fancy would steal over both that she was not exactly
what she seemed, and that that xhich was hidden
was not exactly that which MIs. IIamilton believed it;
and this fancy strengthened by a certain indefinable
yet felt change in Ellen, commencing about thirteen
months after she had parted from her brother. Mrs.

but at length she could no longer conceal from herself

timcs ahost shrinking, and sad, as in her chilthood.
The openness, nnd almost light-henrtedness, which for
one brief year had so charncterized her, seemed com-
pletely but so insensibly to have gone, that MIrs. IlIamilton
could not sntisfy herself ns to the time of tle commence-
mcnt, or reason of the change. IIer temper, too, beeame
fitful, and naltogether, her aunt's anxicty and bewilder-
ment as to her rcal character rcturned in full force.
Onete, when gently questionuel as to why her temper
was so alterel, llen confessed, with tears, that she
knew it was, but shc could not help it, she bclieved shc
was not wcll ; nnd Mrs. IIamilton callel in MIr. Mnitland,
who said that shereally as in a highly nervous state,
nnd rcequired care and quictness, and the less notice that
was taken of hcr momentary irritability ar depression

his young putient blessed him for those words; giving
n reason for and so allowing the trepitation which paled
ler cheek, parched hcr lips, and made her hand so
tremble, when she reccived a lettcr from ler brother,
to pass unnoticed.
lBut change in manner was not all; anlmost every
second or third month Ellen's allowance of pocket-
money (whieh was unusually liberal, nas MIrs. lInmilton
wishel to accustom her girls, from an early age, to
purchase some few articles of dress for themselves, and
so learn thc value of money) most strangcly and myste-
riously disappeared. Ellen eitler coull not or would
not give any account of it; and, of course, it not only
cxposed her to her aunt's ost serious displeasure, but
inespressilly cighteued not only MIrs. IIamiltou'e

15
bewilderment and anxicty, but MIiss IIarcourt's and
Caroline's unspoken prejudice. lFrom the time of
Eward's departurc, Ellen had never been discoered in
or suspected of either uttering or acting an untruth;
but her silence, hcr appnrent determined ignorance of,
or resolution not to confess the cause of tle incom-
prelensible dieappearance of oer allowance, naturally
compelled MIrs. IIamilton to revert to the propensity of
her childhoold, and fear that trutbfuluess was again
deserting her. IIer displeasure lasting, of course, the
longer, from Ellen's want of openness, and the air of
what anlmost appeared to he anxsious yet still affectionate
aunt like sullen defiance (in reality, it was alost
deepair), when spoken to, caused a painful degree of
estrangement between them, always, howeer, giing
place to MIrs. IIamilton's usual caressing amner, the
moment Ellen seemed renlly repentant, and her month's
expenditure could be properly explained.
For six or eight months before the day on which we
recommence our narratie, there had been, hovever,
nothing to complain of in Ellen, except still that un-
natural resere and frequent depression, as if dreading
something she knew not what, hich, as every other
part of her conduct was sntisfactory, MIrs, Hamilton tried
to comfort herself was physical alone. No reterence ta
the past was ever made: her manner to her niece ecame
the same as usual; but she could not feel secure as to
her character, and, what was most painful, there were
times when she was conpclled to dobt even lleu's
affection for hersolf, a thing she had never had tha

slightest cause to do even when she was a little inaniate
ehild.
But very few changes had taken place in the Groeville
nnd Grahame families. MIrs. Greville'a trial continued
in unmitigated, if not hcightened, bitterness: the ex-
nmple, thc companionship of his father had appeared to
have bhlighted cvery good seel whiel she had strenuouasly
endenvoured to plant in thc bosom of her son. At six-
teen he was already an accomplishcd man of the world,
in its most painful sensc: he had his own companions,
his own haunts; scarccly cver visiting his home, for a
reason which, could his poor mother have known it,
would have given her some slight gleam of comfort.
IIe could not associate either with her or his sister,
without feeling a sort of lontling of himself, a longing
to be to them as Percy and Herbert IIamilton were nt
Oakwood; and not having the mornl courage sufficient
to break from the control of his father, and the cxciting
pleasures in which thatcontrol initiatel him, he shrunk
more and more from the only spot in which etter feel.
ings were so awakencd within him as to give him pain.
To denden this nacknowledged remorse, his manner
was rudc and unfeeling, so that his very visits, though
inexpressibly longed for by his mother, brought only
inerease of grief.
MIs. Greville seemed herself so inured to suffering,
that she bore up against it witout any visible failing of
ealth; struggling against its enervating offects, nore
perhaps than she was awnre of hcrsoelf, for the sake of
one treasure still granted her-her own almost angel

MIar-who, she knew, without her love and constant
cheerfulness, must sink beneath such a constant aggra-
vated trial. Yet that sery loe brought incrense of
anxiety from more than one cnuse. As yet there was
no change in their mauner of living, but MIrs. Grerille
knew that, from the excesses of hcr husband and son,
tlere very soon must be. Ruin, poverty, all its fearful
ills, stood before her in perspective, and how could
MIary's fragile frame and gentle spirit bear up against
 them? Again and again the question pressed upon her-
Di Herbert Hamilton indeed love her child, as erery
passing year seemed to confirm? and ifhe did, ould-
could his parents consent to his union with the child of
such a father, the sister of such a brother? There were
always long messages to MIary in Herbert's letters to
his mother, which Mrs. Hamilton not onl delivcred
herself, but sometimes even put the whole letter in
Mary's hand, and at last luglingly said, she really
thought they had much better write to each other, as
tlhen she slould chance to get a letter all to herself, not
merely be te medium of a communication between
them; and MIary, though she did slightly blush, which
sle was in the hbit of doing for scarcely anything,
seemed to tink it so perfectly natural, that she merely
said if Herbert had time to write to her, she should
like it ery much, and she would certaiuly answer
him.
 MIy dcar Emmeline, what are you about?'' was
Mrs. Greille's anxious appeal, the moment they were
alone.

: Giing pleasure to two young folks, of whom I am
most exeessively fond,'' was Mrs. IIamilton's laughing
reply. `Don't loolc so terrified, my dear Jessie. They
love eaeh other as boy and girl now, and if the love
should deepen into that of man and woman, why, all I
can say is-I would rather have your MIary for my
Herbert than any one elsce I know.''
Sle is not only my Mlary?'' nnswere the poor
mother, with sucha quivering of the eye and lip, that
it checkcd MIrs. Hamilton's joyousness at once.
 She is your NIary, in all that can make such a
character as my Herbert happy,'' was her instant reply,
with a pressure of MIrs. Greville's hand, that said far
more than her words. I am not one of those, who
like to ake matchcs in anticipation, for man' s best laid
schemcs are so often overtlrown by the most tritling
hut unforeseen chances, that display a mucl wiser pro-
videncee than our greatest wisdom, that I should con-

Herbert should indeed ever wish to choose your Mlary as

And she was right. Nor, we think, did tho purity
and innocence of those letters, so intensely interesting
to each other, give place to any other style, even when
they chanced to discover that MIrs. HIamilton was utterly
ignorant of their contents, except that which they chose
to read or impart to her themselves.
But een tlis assurance on the part of one so loved
and trusted as Mrs, IIamilton, could not entirely remove
MIrs. Greville's ague anticipations of eril. MIr. Greville
always shunned, and declared he hntel, the Hamilton
family; but as he seemed to entertain the same tfeeling
towards herself and her poor Mlary, she tried to comfort
herself by the iden that he would never trouble his
head about his daughter, or be glad to get her out of
his way, especially if sle married well. Still anxiety
for the future would press upon her; only calmed by
her firm unchanging faith in that gracious ever-watchful
Proridence, who, if in spite of her heavy troubles she
still tried to trust and serve, would order all things for
the hest; and it was this, this faith alone, which so
supported her, as to permit her to make her child'n
homc and heart almost as happy as if her path had all
been smooth.
In the Grahame family a change had taken place, iu
MIaster Cecil's being sent to Eton some time before his
father had intended; but so man cases of Lady IHIelen's
faulty indolence and ruinous indulgence had come under

quite delighted, but his mother was so indignant, that
she overcame her habitual awe of her husband, sufli-
ciently to vow that she would not live so far from her
son, and if hc must go to school, she mustlenve MIoor-
lands. Grahame, with equal positiveness, declared thnt
he would not give up a home endenred to him so long,
nor so entirely break off his companionship with his
denrest friecnds. A very stormy dialogue of course took
place, nd ended by both parties being more resolvsed to
entertain their own opinion. The interposition of MIr.
and MIrs. IInmilton, however, obtained some concession
on Grahamc's part, and he promised that, if Lady lIelen
would make Moorlands her home from the middle of
July till the end of Oetober, Noember and DDecember
should be spent in the vicinity of Eton, aud she should
then have six months for London and its attraetions.
This concession brought baek all Indy Helen's smiles,
and charmed Annie, though it was a sourcc of renl
regret to Cnroline, who could not help feeling a little
pained at her friend's small concern at this long separa-
tion from her, but still she loved her; and, as Anie
wrote frequently, and when she was at Mloorlnnds never
tired of her society, (the cight months of absence giing
er so much interesting matter to impart,) Caroline was
not only satisfied, but insensible to the utter want of
sympathy which Annie manifested in her pursuits, ler
pleasures. MIrs. Iamilton oftcu wished that Curoline
huad chosen one more descrving of her friendship, but
she trusted that time and expericnce would teach her
Anuie's real charaeter, and so did not feel any anxiety
on that score.
IOE 1YFLENCE.
21
There was only one member in Grahame's family,
that MIr. and MIrs, Hamilton hoped might bring joy and
comfort to their frieud, and that was his little Lilla.
She was five years youuger than Annie, and being much
less attractive, seemed almost forgotten, and so was
spared the dangerous ordeal of flattery and indulgence
to which Aunie had been subject; and from being more
iolent and less ageeable than Cecil, was not so fre-
quently spoiled by her mother. They feared the poor
child wonld have much to endure from her own temper,
Annie's overbearing insolence, and Lady IIelen's cul-
pable indolence; but Mrs. Hamilton hoped when she
resided part of the year in London, as she felt she would
ery soon be called pon to do, to be enhled to rouse
Grahame's attention towards his roungest child, and
preail on him to relax in his sternness towards her;
and by taking notice of her contiuually herself, instil
such feelings in her, as would attract her towards her
father, and so increase the appiness of both. Eery
visit of the Grahame family to MIoorlands, she resolved
to studr Lilla well, and try all she could to make one in
reality so estimable, as her husband's friend, happy, in
one child at least.
It had been Mr. and MIrs. Hamilton's intention to go
to London the January after Carolinc was seenteen.

a partial introduction to the world, by haing the best

a lalf, she should bc fully introduccd. Caroline of course
nnticipated this period with the most intense delight.
She was quite satisfiel that in her first visit shc should
study as much as, if not more than, before; and content
and thnkful tlat her mother would allow her to enter
so far into socicty, as always to join dinner or evening
parties at home, and go to some of hcr most intimate
friends, when their coteries were very smll and friendly,
and another eagerly anticipated delight, sometimes go
to the opera and thc best concerts, and visit all the
galleries of art.
1o poor Emmeline thcse anticipations gave no pleasure
whatever; she hated the very thought of leaving Oak-
wood, firmly convinced thnt not the most highly intel-
lectual, nor the most delightful social enjoyment in
London, could equal the pure dclights of Devonslire
and home. Ellen seemed too engrossed with her own
thoughts to evince a feeling either way, much to her
aunt's regret, as her constant quietness and secming
determined reprcssion of her scntimcnts, rendcred er
character still ore ifticult to read.
But a heay disappoiutment was preparing for Caro-
line, in the compelled postpoemcnt of ler bright anti-
cipations. To understand te causes of which, we must
glance back on an eent in the Hamilton family, whicl
ad oceurred some years before its presenthcad was born.

Hamilton, the grandfather of our friend, of the same

regard of the reigning sorereign, Christian VII, that on
his departure, the royal wish was expressed for his
speedy return. On his oyage home, he was wrecked
off the Feroe Islands, and rescuel from danger and
death by the strenuous exertions of the islanders, who
entertained him and the crew with the utmost lospi-
tality, till tlcir slip was again sea-worthy. During his
inoluntar detention, MIr. IHIamilton becme deeply inter-
 ested in the Feroese, a people liing, it seemed, in the
midst of desolation, a cluster of small rocky islets,
dirided by soe hundred miles of stormy sea from their
fellows. He made the tour of tle islands, and found
almost all their inlhabitants possessing the same charac-
teristics as those of Samboe, the island of hich he had
been wrecked; kind, hospitable, honest, temperate,
inclined to natural piety, bnt so perfectly indifferent to
the arious prisations and anuoyances of their lot, as to
make no effort towards remoing them.  Traelling either
by Iand or sea was so dangcrous and difficult, that in
some parishes, the clergyman could only perform service
tice a year,'f or once erery one, two, or three months.
The islands in hich the clergyman resided, were, MIr.
Hamilton obsered, in a much higher state of cicilization
and morality tan amboe and some oters, and an earnest
desire took possession of him, to do some real serice
for those wo lad saed him from danger and treated
him so hospitably. He very spcedily acquired tleir

found also that if their ancicnt customs and traditions
were lcft undisturbed, they were vcry ensily lcd, and this
discovery strengthened his purpose. Ilis departure was
universally regretted; an his promise to return ima-
gined too great a privilege to be bclieved.
As soon as his political dnties in England peritted,
MIr. IInmilton revisited Denmnrk, and was receied
with such cordiality as to encourage him to make lis
petition for the improvement of lis Majesty's poor
sujects of Samboe. It was granted directly; thc little
island so far made over to him, that he was nat liberty
to introduce and erect whateer he pleased withtin it;
and Mr. IIamilton, all eagerness for the perfection of
his plans, returned with speed to Eugland; obtaincd
the valuable aid of a poor though worthy clergyman,
who, with is wife, voluntarily oflered to make Samuboe
their lome and assist their benefactor, (for such MIr.
Hamilton ad long been,) to the rery best of their

each time he had more reason to be satisfied with the
effect of his schemes. MIr, and Mrs. Wilson were per-
fectly happy. heir son was unitetl to thc pretty and
excellent dnughter of one of the Danish clergymen,
and a young family was blooming round them, so that
there seemed a fair promise of the ministry of Snmboe
continuing long in charge of te same family.
MIr. Hamilton, on his deathbed, exacted a promise
from his son that he would not permit the island to fall
 back into its old habits; but that, if required, he would
visit it himself. The visit was not required, but Percy
Hamilton, (the father of the present possessor of
Onkwood,) from respect to his father's memory, made a
oyage to Samboe on the demise of the elder Wilson.
IHe found everything flourishiug and happy; Freleric
Wilson had bcen received as their pastor and head,
with as much joy as their regret for his father would
permit; and Ir. IIamilton returned to England, satisfied
with hiself, and inexpressibly touehed by the veneration
still entertained in that distant island for his father.
The same promise was demandel by him from his son,
and Arthur IIamilton had visited Feroe directly after
the loss of his parent, and hefore his engagement with
MIiss MIanvers. He found it in the same satisfactory

A LETTER, AND ITS CONSEUECES.

I was the setenth of June, and one of those glorious
mornings, when Nature looks lovclicr than eer. The
windows of the renkfast-room were thrown widely
open, and never did thc supcrb trees of Oakwood Park
look richer or display a greater ariety of grecn. The
lower-garden, on part of which the breakfast-room
opened, was actually dazzling with its profusion of
brilliant flowers, on whicl the sun looked down so
gloriously; a smooth lawn whose green was a perfeet
emerald, stretched down from the parterre till it was lost
in woody openings, which disclosed the winding river,
that, lying as a lake on one side, appeared to sweep
rouud some exquisite scenery on the opposite side, and
form anothcr lake, about a mile further. It wns
Emmcline's favorite view, and she always declared, that
it so varied its aspccts of loveliness, she was sue, it
nevcr lookel two mornings cxactly alike, and so long
would shc stand and admire, that her mother often
threatened to senl her, hcr breakfast in her own room,
where the view, though picturesque, would not so com-

' An inclosure for you, Ellen; wly, that is as queer

Do let your cousin's paleness alone,'' interposed
MIrs. IIamilton, gaily. I really cannot perceive she
has any less colour than usual, and as for the inclosure,
Edward often has something to add at the last moment,
and no room to inscrt it, and so there is nothing remark-
able in his using another half sheet.''
Emmeline always creates wonders out of shadows,''
said Caroline, dryly.
'And you neer see anything but dull, coarse, eavy
realities,'' langhed her sister, in reply.  Come, llen,
tell us something of this idle brother of yours, who
promised to write to me every packet, and neer
does,''
Ellen read nearly the whole letter aloud, and it was
unusually entertaining, for the ship had bcen cruising
about the last mont, and Edarl described the arious
scenes and new places he had visited more lengthily
than usual. He anticipated with great glee an egege-
ment with some desperate pirates, whose track they
were pursuing.

Nor is it; Sir Edward seled, direeted, and put it

an engagement did take place.''
 And Eward-oh Uncle, is he hurt? I am sure, he

There, Ellen, I think that is a still better birthday-

of my nephew as Sir Edward is.''

Ellen, trying to conquer her erotion,

And Ellen gladly obeyced; for it was from no imagin-
ary cause, that the receipt of Edward's letters so often
paled her cheek, and parched her lip with terror. She
knew that, concerning him, whicl none else but Harding
did; and even when those letters iparted nothing but
that which she could reasd to her family, the dread was
quite enough to banish anting like the elastic happi-

of those she loed. His letter this time, howerer, had

To widow agford, Ellen tried to resolse that she

not marked the lapse of time, or had caused her to for-
get that her letter must be read in a week. The party
were all going a delightful excursion, and to drink tea

drawer, tool thcnce a small cross and one or two otler
trinkets, put thcm up, and taking off' hor watcl, looked
at it with such an expression of suffering, that it seemed
as if she could not go on, carefully folded it up with the
othor trinkets, and murmuring, ``if nnrse ILangford will

with damp, one of whicl she raised mcchanicall, and
started up with a sild cry, and seized the others alost

plan she could think of, as binging thc lenst hope of

dispose of her watch annd trinkets, and the very first
mcntion she hcard made of the loss to return the full
sum to the real possessor, if possible, so secretly as for
it not to be traced to herself. She thought, too, that
if she gave hcr trinkets, one by one, not altogethcr, to
MIrs. Langford, it would be less suspicious, and,
perlaps, more ensily prevail on her to grant ler secreey
and assistance; and if she positively refused, unless
Ellen revenled the rcason of her desiring their disposal,
and would solemnly promise secrecey, she would tell her
sufficient of her intense misery, as might pcrhaps induce
her to give her aid. If she did not demand the reason
and betrayed her, she must cndure the doubt and serious
displeasure such a course of acting on her part would
inevitably produce; but two things alone stood clear

A SUIIONS ND A LOSS.
MIn. MLD declarel Ellen to be ill of a nerous
fever, which for thee days confined her to hor bed, and
loeft her very weak for some little timc, and so nervous
that the least thing scem to startle her; but, as he said
it was of no conscqucuce, and shc would soon rccover,
Mrs. Hamilton adopted is advice, took no noticc of it,
and only endeavoured to makc hcr nicec's tnily routiue
us varied in employment, thougl regular in hours and
undisturbed in quiet, as she could. Perhaps shc would
have felt more anxious and discovered something not
uite usual in Ellen's maner, if her thoughts had not
been painfully preoecupied. About a week after their
excursion, she entered the library carlier than usual,
and found her husband intently cngaged with some
despatches, just received. She saw he was more than
ordinarily disturbed, and hesitated a oment whcther to
nddress him; but he was seldon so engrossed as to be
unconscious of the prcsence of his wife.

is so imperatively ueeded, that I am self-repronehed at
not going before; the long silence ought to hae con-
inced mc that all was not as it should be,''
 But what has occurred, Arthur? I had no idea you
ccnteplated thc neecessity of going,'' replied his wife,
very quietly, as she sat down close by im; but the fiat
of separation, the thoughts of a perilous voyage, a visit
to au almost dcsolate island, and the impossibility of
receiving regular letters, so crowded upon her all at
onee, that it was a strong effort to spcak at all.
 No, dcarest; for wlat was the use of tormcnting you
witl disagreeable anticipations, when thcre rcally might
have bceen no foundation for them. The last accounts
fromSamboe were, as you know, received nearly two ycars
ngo, telling me that Frelerie WVilson was dcnd, but that
his son had been reccived as his successor in the
miuistry aud as ciil guardian of the island, with, if
possible, a still greater degree of popularity thau his
predeeessors, from his having been edueated in Dcnmark.
His parents had lived on straitened means to give him
superior advantages, which, as it proves, he would hae
been much better without. The vices he has aequired
havce far outrun the advantages. His exnmple, and that
of a bnnd of idle irregular.spirits wlo have joined him,
has not only scandalized tle simple people bnt disturbed
their homcsteads, brought contcntion and misery, and,
in some cascs, bloodshel; so that in point of soeial and
domestic position, I fear they hae sunk lower than

matlher of this unhappy yong man has, naturally

him; but her brother, the clcrgyman of Osteroe,
has at length taken upon himself to do so, clearly
stating that nothing but personal interference and some
mnonths' residence amongst them will elfect a reforma-
tion; nnd that the ruin is the more to bc regretted, as
the little island has been for more than half a ccntury
the admiration not ouly of its imediate neighbours,
but of all who have chanced to lnrbour oIf its const.
He states, too, that if properly directed and not exposed
to the contagion of large citics, as his brother has been,
poor Wilson's younger son, now a boyv of eleven, may
become as worthy and judicious a pastor as his father
and grandfuther, and so keep the ofticce in his fmnily, as
my grandfather was so lesirous of doing. The qucestion
is, how is this boy to be educated on the island, and
whom can I find to take the ninistry mennwhile.''
`And must your own residence there be very long,''
inquirel MIrs. Hamilton, still in that quiet tone, but
er lip quivered.
It depends so entirely on wlom lI can get to aecom-
pany me, dearest. I must set MIr. HIoward and Mlorton
to work to find me some simple-minled, single-hearted
individual, who will regnrd this undertaking in the
same missionary spirit as te elder Wilson did. If I
am happy cougl to sueceed in this, I hope a year
or somewhat less, will be the farthcst limit of our
separation.''
 A yearl a whole long year-dearest Arthur, must
it be so very, very long'''

replied M. HIarilton, trying to smile, and folding his
nrm fonlly round his wife, he kissed the cheek which
had hecome pale from the effort to restrain her feelings.
 It is indeed an uuexspected and a painful trial, nd,
as is generally the case ith our rebellious spirits, I feel
as if it would hae been better borne at any other period
than the present. We had so portioned out this year,
had so anticipated gratifying Caroline by introducing
her to the so long and so eagerly auticipated pleasures
of London next January, that I cannot bear to think of
her disappointmcnt.''
`Aud our boys, too, they say it is so strange to be
withiout their father, eren in college term; what ill it
be when they come home for the long racation, to
which we have all so looked forwnrd? ut this is all
wenkness, my own dear husband; forgive me, I am only
rendering your duty more diffeult,'' she alded, rising
her head from his shoulder, and smiling cheerfully, een
while tle tears glistened in her ees.  I must tr nnd
practise my ow lesson, and beliee the term of sepa-
ration will really pass quickly, interminable as it now
seems. We have becn so blessed, so guardcd fron the
bitter pang of even partial separation for twenty years,
that how dare I murm the trial has comenot? It is
God's pleasure, dearest Artlur, though it seens like the
work of man, and as Hs we can endure it.''
 Bless you, my beloved? you hne indeed put a new
spirit in me by those words,'' replied her husbanl, vith
a fonness the more intense from the actual veneration
thmat so largely mingled witl it. Aud bitter disap-

absence.''
MIr. nnd MIrs. IInmilton remuined some hours to-
gether that morning in earnest conversation. All of
individual regrct was conquere for tle sake of the
otler: its exspression at lenst, not its feeling; but they
understood each other too well, too foudly, to need
words or complaints to prove to either how intensely
painful was the very thought of separation. To elude
the performanec of a duty wlich many pcrsons, un-
able to enter into the hope of offccting good, would,
no doubt, pronounce uixotic-for what could the
poor inhabitants of Samboe be to him?-never
enterel eithcr Mr. or MIrs. Inmilton's mind. He
was not one to neglect his immediate duties for dis-
tant ones; but believed and acted on the belief, that
botl could be united. His own large estate, its va-
rious farms, parishes, and villages, were so admirably
ordered, that he could lcave it without the snallest
scruple in the hauds of his wife and steward. Though
interested in, and actnally assisting in the political
movements of his country, he was still, as from his
youth he hal firmly rcsolvel to be, a frce iudcpendent
Englishman; bound to no party, but respcctcd by nll;
etaining his own principles unshaken as a rock,
though often and often his integrity had been tried by
court bribes and dazzling offers. And yet, rare blend-
ing with such individual feelings, Arthur Hamilton
looked with candour and kindncss on the conduct and
priuciples of others, howeer they might differ from

his own, and found excuses for them, which une
others could. That he shonld gie up all the comforts,
the luxuries, the dclights of his peculiarly happy home,
to eneounter several months' sojourn in a bleak, half-
cisilizel island, only in the hope of restoring and en-
suring moral and religious improement to a small
colon of human bheings, whose sole claim upon him
was, that they were immortal as himself, and that they
had done a kindness to his grandfather more than half
na century back, was likely to, and no doubt did, excite
the utmost astonishment in very mauy circles; but not
a sueer, not a word seeming to whisper good should
he done at home before sought abroad, could find a
roment's resting-place near Arthur Hamilton's name.
For half an hour after Mrs. Hamilton quitted her
husbnnd she remained aloe, and when she rejoined
ler faily, though she might have been a shade paler
than her wont, she was as cheerful in conrersation and
earnest in manner as usual. That erening MIr. Hamilton
informed his children and Mfiss Harcourt of his intended
departure, and consequent compelled change of plan.
kEmmeline's burst of sorrow was iolent and uncon-
trollcd. Caroline lookel for a minute quite bewilderel,
and tuen hastening to her father, threw one arm round
his neck, exclaiming, in a voice of the most affectionate
sincerity, ' Dear apa, what shall we do withont you
for such a long time?''
MIy dear clilll I thank you for suceh an affectionate
thought; beliere me, the idea of our wishes being
postponed has pained me as much as anything else in
this unpleasant dut.''

My wishes postponed, Pnpa-what do you mean ?''
IIave you quite forgotten our intended plans for
next January, my love?-MIy absence must alter them,''
For an momcnt an cxpression of bitter disappoint-
ment clouded Cnroline's open eountenance.
Indeed, Papa, I hal forgotten it; I only thought of
your going away for so many months. It is a great
disappointment, I on, and I dnre say I shall feel it
still more whcn January comes; but I am surc parting
tro you must be a still greater trial to MIamma, than
any such disappointment ought to be to mc; and,
indoed, I wiIl try and benr it as uncomplainingly and
cheerfully as she does.''
Her father almost involuntarily drew her to his hceart,
and kissed her two or three timcs, without speaking;
and Caroline was very glad he did so, for when she
1ooked up again, the teairs that would come at the first
thought of her disappointment werc bravely sent back
again; and she tried to cheer Emmeline, by assuring
her she neer could be like her favorite heroines of
romance, if she belaved so very much like a child;
taking the opportunity when tley retired for the night,
to say more seriously-
bDenr Emmeline, do try and be as liely as you
nlwsays are. I am sure poor Mamma is suffering very
much at the idea of Papa's leaving us, though she will
not let us see that she does, and if you give way so, it
will make her more uncomfortable still.''
Emmeline promised to try; but her disposition, quite
as susceptible to sorrow ns to joy, and not nearly ns
firm as her sister's, rendered the promise very difhicult

to fulfl. It was her first sorrow, and MIrs. Hamiltou
watched her witl some anxiety, half fearful that she
had been wrong to shield her so carefully from anything
like grief; it, when it came, she should proe unequal
to its firm and uncomplaiuing ecndurance. Ellen had
beeu out of the room when MIr. Hamilton had first
spoken ; and engaged in sootliug Emmeline when she
re-entered and the nes was communicated to her, he
did not observe anything particular in her ode of
receiving it. But MIrs. Hamilton was so struck with the
expression of her countenance, which, as she tricd some-
what incoherently to utter regrets, took the place of its
usual calm, that she looked at her seeral minutes in
bewilderment; but it passed again, so completely, that
she was angry with ersolf for fancying anything u-
comon. Caroline, however, had rearked it too, and
she could not help obsering to Mliss Hlarcourt, the first
time they were alone-
You will say lI am always faneyiug something extra-
ordinary, MIiss Harcourt; but Ellen certainly did look
pleased last night, wlen Mamma told her of Papa's
intendcd departure.''
Tue expression must have been someting extra-
ordinary for you to remark it at all,'' replied Miss
Harcourt; `nobody but Mrs. Hamilton, hose pene-
tration is out of the comon, can cver read anything
on Ellen's faee.''
` And it was or that very reason I looked again, and
Mamma noticed it too, and was surprised, though she
did not say anything. If she really be plesed, she is

I never sliall understand Ellen, I hclieve; but I do hope
MIamma will ever discover that she is not exactly that
which her affection beliees her.''
 1ray do not talk so, my dear Caroline, or I shall
be temptcd to confess that you are giving words to my
own feelings. lIcr conduct with regard to the disap-
pearance of her allowanee, the wholly unsatisfactory
account of its cxpenditure, even every month, for slc
seems to me to mention many things she has never
hal, banisl eery hopeful feeling, and I dread more
than I can tell you, the ery thing you have expresscd.
But all this is very wrong; we have relieved ench other
by a mutual aeknowledgmont, and now let us never
revert, even in thougt, if possible, to the subject,''
Cnroline willingly aequiesced, for it was far from
ugrcecable. Mr. IInmilton's preparations meanwhile
apidly progressed. He imparted his vishes for a
companion willing to remain in the island, till young
Wilson shounld be prepared for the ministry, both to MIr.
loward an Mr. Morton (the latter still reminel in
his desolate parish, still more isolated in feeling from
the loss of both his parents, and Percy's absence), and
both, cspecially Mlorton, gave him every hope of obtain-
ing the claracter he wanted. HIis next inquiry was at
bDartmouth for a strong well-built vesscl, fitted to
encounter the stormy seas between Scotland and Feroc,
determining to do all in his powcr to provide some
means of regular communication between himsclf and
the beloved inmates of his home. Wiel, in Caithness,
was the farthest post ton to which letters could bc

aldressed. Eery ten dnys or fortnight communications
were to be sent there and the Syren, after coneying
him to Feroe, was regularly to ply between Samboe and
Wick, bringiag from the latter place to Mr. Hamilton
the various letters that had accumulated tlere, should
unfavorable winds hae lengthened the royage, and for-
warlinug his throngl that post to his home. By this
means, he hoped to hear and be heard of regularly; an
intense relief, if it really could be so accomplished, to
his wife.
As soon as a ship, a competent captain, mate, and
crew were obtained, MIr. Hamilton set off for Oxford
nnd London, wishing in the latter place to see his friend
Grahame, and in the former to pass a few days witln
his sons, who, knowing nothing of his summons, received
him with unbounded delight. Their regret, wvhen they
heard the cause of his visit, was as great as their joy
had been. Percy, in a desperate fit of impatience, wished
the little island and all its concerns at the bottom of
the sea, the best place for such unruly disagreeable
peoplc; and e as only sobered when his father put
hefore him that, though it must be a ery heightened
indiidual disappointment, it was the greatest confort
to him, to think that they would both be with their
mother and sisters the first few months of his absence.
Percy instantly altored his tone.
t You are quite right, my dear father; I was rery
selfish not to think of it. Trust me for making my
dearest mother as cheerful and as happy as I can.
You lon't know what a guardian angel the thought of
her lore has been to me in temptation; and as for
Bertie, if ever I thought he was studing himnself ill,

nd not taking the care of himiself he ought, or wantel
him to tnke exercise and recrcalion, when he thought
mue a great bore, the word mothcr, made him yield at
once.''
And IIerbort's kindling eye and chooek bore testimony
to the truth of his brother's words. HIis only feeling
and exsclamation had been, if he might but accompany
his fathcr, and save him all the trouble he could;
allowing, howeer, its impossibility, when the cireum-
stances of lis still delicate health and the necessity for
interrupted study, were placed before him.
That visit to Oford was a proud one for Mr. IIamilton.
His sons held that place in the estimation of the pro-
fessors, superiors, and their fellow-collegians which
their early influenccs had promised, and which, as thc
sons of Arthur IIamilton, seemed naturally thcir own.
Percy could so combine firmncss in principle, uubending
rectitude in conduct with such an spirit of fun and
enjoyment, as rendered him the primc mover of all
sports at Oxford, as he hal bcen at Onkwood; and
Herbert, though so gentle andretiring (as, until Percy's
spirit was roused to shield him), gained im many nick-
names aud many petty annoyances, silently and insen-
sibly won his way, and so bore with the thoughtless,
thc mirthful, and even the faulty, as at length to gain
him the privilege of being nllowed to do just as he
liked, and win by his extraordinary talents the admi-
ration and love of all the professors with whom hc
was thirown.

remai in the island, attending to all that was requirel
in its superintendence, and in the education of young
Wilson, till le was old enough and properly fitted to
take lis father's place. Great, the, wns Ir, HInmilton's
disappointment, wlen MIorton entered his library accord-
ing to appointment, but quite alone. Still greater was
his astonishent, when he found it was MIorton himself,
thus eagerly desirous to become his companion, urging
is wishes, his motires, MIr. Howard's sanction, with such
earuestness, such single-mindedness of purpose, that every
objeetion wlich, for hlorton's on sake, MIr. lamilton so
strenuously brought forward, was oerruled; and, aftera
lengthened interies, matters were arranged to the entire
satisfaction of both parties. The idea of tle companion-
ship and aid of such a friend as Mlorton briuging as
great a relief to both Mlr. and MIrs. Hanilton, as their
scquiescence filled the whole heart of the young mis-
sionary with the most unbounded gratitude and joy. IHe
suggested many little things, which, in the agitation of
his hasty summons, had escaped his friends, and his
whole being seemed transformcd from dcspondency and
listlessness to energy and lope. Engrossed as he was,
MIr. Hamilton's usual thought for others had not
deserted him, and hc remarked that one of his house-
old, Robert Lngford, so often mentioued, appeared
to linger in thc library after moruiug and evening
service, as if anxsious to speals to him, but failing in
courage so to do. Ie thought, too, tlat te young man

of speking before his departure, if he wishel it, Mlr.
IIamilton summoned him to arrangc, write a list, and
pack some books, whicl Mlorton had selectel to take
with him. For some time Robert pursued his work in per-
severing silence, but at length fixed lis eyes on his master
with such bescecling carnestness, that MIr. IIamilton
inquired the matter at once. It was some time befor
the young man could sufficiently compose himself ta
speak with any coherency, but at last MIr. Hamilton
gathercd the following details.
About five weeks previous (the first day of June) hc
had been iutrusted, as he had very often before been,
by his master, witl certain papers nnd law articles to
conrey to Plymouth, and with a pockct-book containing
thirty pounds, in two ten and two fie ound notes,
which he had orders to leave at some poor though
respeetnble familics, wlom MIr. Hamilton was in the
habit of oceasionally anssisting, though they were out
of his own domains. he morning he wns to have
started on this expedition a cousin, whom he had
always regarded as a brother, came unexpectedly to see
him. Ie had just arrived at Plymouth from n four
enrs' residence with his regiment in Ireland, and
Robert's glee was so great, nas to require reiternted com-
mands from the stewarl to take cnre of the papers, and
not stay at his mother's cottage, where hc was to take
his cousin, later than the afternoon. He lingered so
long before he set off fron Okwood, that hc gatherel
up all thc papers as quickly as he could, forgot his
principal charge, so fa at least as not to look to the
sccure fastening of the pocket-book, and hastened ith

his cousin throughl the brushwood and glade we hase
hefore mentioned, to his mother's cottage. It was ery
hot, and the young men, hcated and in cager conversa-
tion, took off their coats, threw them loosely over their
arms, and proceeded on thcir walk without them, much
too engrossed with eacl other to be aware that, as they
carried their coats, it was the easiest and most natural
thing possible for all the smaller contents of tleir
pockets to fall out, and if not missed lircctly, fromn the
inding and rugged wood patl, not likcly to he found
again. A drnught of cider and inlf an hour's rest at
MIrs. Langford's cottage sufficiently revived ohert to
resume his coat ; he satisfied himself that his packet of
papers was secure, and, as he imagined from the feel of
anotlcr poeket, the pocket-book also.
What, then, was his consteruation, when he approached
the first house at wich he was to leae ten pounds of
the money, about twenty miles from Oakwood, to discorer
tht the pocket-book was gonel and that wlich, by its
feel, he bclieved to have been it, an old card-case, that
his young master Percy ad laughingly thrown at lim
one day after failing in his cndeaour to emblazon it,
the sticky materials he had used causing it to adhere
to whatever it touched, and so preserving it in Robert's
pocket, when almost all the other things had fallen out.

thoughtlessness again and again, and would have re-
tracet his stcps imneliatcly, bnt the papers with
which le was intrustcd hmad to be leliered at Plymouth
by a ccrtain bonr, and he could not o it. The intense
heat of the day gae place in the evening to a tre-
mendous storm of thundcr and lightning, wind and
very heavy rain, which last continued unabatel through
the night. IIe returued home, or ranther to his motler's
cottage, the next day, in a state of mind little removed
from distraction; scarchel the path he had traversed
with his cousin in every direction, but only succeeded
in fiuding some worthless trifles, and the pockct-book
itself, but open and cupty; but at a little distance from
it one f3 note. In an instant he remembered that in
his hurry he had failed to see to its proper fastening: if
he had, all would have een right, for tle wind and
rain woul hnardly have hal power to open it, and dis-
perse its contents. Hour nfter hour he passed in thce
vain scarch for the rcmaindet; the storm had rendered
the path more intricate; the gotund was slimy, and
quantities of dried sticks and broken branches and
leaves almost covered it. IIe told his tale to his mother
in the deepest distress; whnt was he to do? She
andvisoed him to tell the steward the wlole story, and to
request him to keep bnck the sum she was in the habit
of receiving quarterly, till the whole amount could be
repaid. obert obeyed her, bnt with most painful re-
luctance, though even thcen he lid not imagiue all the
misery his carelessncss would entail upon him. Mlorris,
as was nntural, was excecdingly displeased, andnot only
reproved him very severely, but let fall suspicions as to

61
the truth of his story: he knew nothing of his cousin,
he said, anl could not say what company he might hnve
been led into. If the notes had fallen out of his pocket
during his wnlk, they must be found; it was nll nonsense
that the wind and rain could so hae scattered and
annihilated them, as to remoe all trace of them. He
would not say anything to his master, because it would
only annoy him, and the charities he would gie him-
self, not from Mrs. Langford's allowance, but from
Robert's own vages, which he slould certainly stop till
the whole sum was paid; he should take care how he
intrusted such a responsible office to him agin.
Rohert was at first indignant, and violcnt in his pro-
testations of the truth of his story; but as it got wind in
the servants' hall, as he found limself suspected and
shunned by almost all, as days merged into weeks, and
there was no trace of the notes, and Morris and Ellis
both united in declaring that, as no strangers passed
through that part of the park, if found they must hae
been heard of, the young man sunk into a state of the
most gloomy despondency, longing to tell 1is ind
master the whole tale, and yet, naturally enough,
shrinking from the dread of his suspicion of his honesty
as mare terrible than all the rest.
But MIr. IIamilton did not suspect him, nnd so as-
sured him of his firm belief in his truth and innoeence,
thnt it was with great difficulty poor Robert refrained
from throwing imself at is feet to pour forth is
gratitute. IIc was so seserely punishe fom his heed-
lessncss, that his master would not say much ahout it,
nnd soon after lismissing him, summoned Morris, and

talked with him some time on the subject, declaring Mc
would as soon suspect his own son of dishonesty as
the boy who had grown up uder his own eye from
infancy, and thc son of such a mother. It wens ery
distrcssiug for MIrs. angford certainly, the old stcwnrl
allowed, nnd she lookel sad cnougl; but it was no use,
he had tried ard enough to prevent his suspicions,
but they wonld come. None but the serants and the
woomen and gardeners went that path, and if the notes
had been dropped there, they must have been found;
nnd it was n very harl thing for the other servants, as
none kncw wlo might be suspected of appropriating
them. IIis master was much too kind in his opinions,
but he mnst forgie him if he continued to keep a
sharp look out after the young man. MIorris was vcry
old, nd somewhat opinionated; so nll that his mnaster
coull sueceed in, was to insist that he should only keep
baek half of Robert's wages, till the sum was paid.
Take away the whole, anl if he have becn nfortu-
nately lel into temptation, which I do not beliee he has,
you expose him to it again,'' was his judicious connand.
 It is all right le should return it, even though lost only
by carclessness; but I willnot have himn put to such straits
for want of a little money, as must be tle case if you
deprive him of all his wages; and no, my gool MIorris,
if you cannot in conscienee repcat my firm opinion of this
lad's innocence to the servants, I must do it myselt.''
And thnt very cvening after prayers, when the whole
household was asscmblel in the library, MIr. IIamilton ad-
dressed them simply and briefly, mentioniug that Robert

was his own opiion, and that of their mistress, tht he
id not deserve the suspicions attachcd to him, aud
that his fellov-sorvrants would all be acting more cha-
ritably and rcligiously if they bclieved his story, until
tley hal had some strong proof to the contrary: he
could not, of course, interfcre with privte opinion; he
could only tell them his own and their lady's. IIe
acknowledgcd it was a cery uupleasant occurrence, but
e begged them all to dismiss the idea that suspicion
could be attachel to either of them; he felt too convinced,
that had any one of his household chanced to find the
issingnotes, they would at once have mentioned it to the
steward or housekeeper, more especially, since Roert's
loss had been knon amongst them only a few days
nfter it had occurred. Appropriation, he need not tell
them, in such a case was theft, and of that sin, he was
perfectly certain, not one present would be guilty. He
allowed that it vould be much more satisfactory to hae
te tangible proof of Robert's innocence by discovering
some trace of tlem; but it was not unlikely the heavy
wind and rain had destroyed the thin material of the

less favorable opinion, and she could well imagine

TIHE IROKEN DESK.
TirE many secret wishes for an unfasrorable wind,
thuat MIr. Humilton might stay at Oakvood still a little
longer, were not granted, and he left his family the ery
lay he had fixed, the l4th of July, just tlree weeks aftonr
his summons, andl about ten days before his sons were
exspected home. Without him Onkwood wns strange
indeed, but with the exception of Emmciine, all scemed
lctermined to conquer the sadness and anxicty, which
the cparture of one so beloved, naturally occnsioned.
Emmeline was so unused to anything like personal sor-
row, that she ratler seemed to luxuriate in its indulgenuce.
 Do you wish to both disappoint and displecase me,
my dear Emmeline?'' her mother said, one day, about
a week after her husband had gone, as she entered the
music-room, expecting to find her dauglter at the harp,
but pcrccising her instcad, listless and dispirited on the
sofa.  Indeed, you will do both, if you give way to
tlis most uncalled-for gloom.''

and ler eyes filling fast with tears.
I lope not, my love; but if you do not try to shake
off this depression, we must believe youto e so. Your
father's absence is a still grcater trial to Cnroline thau it is
to ou, for it compels a ver bitter disappoiutmeut, as well
as tue loss of his society; aud yet, though she feels both
deeply, she has exerted lerself more than I ever saw her
do before, and so proses, more than any words or tears
could do, how much she loves both him and me.''
' And do you think I love you both, less than she
loes?'' repliel Emmeline, now fairly sobbing.
No, dearest; but I want you to prove it in the same
admirable manuer. Do you think I do not feel your
father's absence, Lmmeline? but would you like to see
me as sad and changed as you are?''
Emrcline looked p in her face, for there was some-
thing in the tone that appealed to her better feclings at
once. Throwing her arms round her, she sobbed-
 Dear Mamma, do forgive me. I see now I havc
been very selfish and ery weak, but I neer, never can
be as firm and self-controlled as you and Caroline aro.''
' Do not say never, lore, or you will never try to be

disposition is nnturally less strong and firm thn your

so had younot too wcally cncouragcd your very natural
sorro, you would have been cnnhled to throw it off, nnd
in the comfort such an cxertion wonld have brought to
us, fully recompensed yourself.''
``And if I lo try now?'
I shall be quite sntisfied, denrest; though I fer you
will find it more difficult thnn had you tried a few days
ago. Confess that I am right. Did you not, after the
first two or three days, fcel that you could have been
checrful again, at least at times, but that you fancied
you had not felt sorry enough, and so increased both
sorrow and anxiety by determinedly dwelling on them,
instead of seeking somne pursuit?''
Dear Mamma, slall Inever be able to hide a feeling
from you?'' answcrcd Emmeline, so astonished, that her
tears half dried.  I did not know I felt so myself till
you putit before me, and now I know thant I really did.
Was it ery wrong ?''
I will answer your question by anothcr, love. Did
you find such pertinacious indulgencc of gloom, help
you to bring the object of yonr regret and anxiety, and
of your own grief before your Henvenly Father ?''
Emeline hesitnted, but only for a minute, then
answered witli a crimson blush.
No, MIamma; I could not pray to God to protect

and bclicingly as when I was happier; the more I

tlhen, dearest, is it necessary for me to answer your
former question? I sce by that conscious look that it is
not. You hae alas trusted my experiencee and affec-
tion, m kmmeline, trust tlen no, and try my plan.
Think of your dear father, whom you cannot love too
well, or whose compellel absence really regret too much;
but so think of him, as to pray continually iu spirit to
your gracious Got, to have him always in Hlis holy keep-
ing, either on sea or land, in storm or calm, aud so
prosper his undertaking, as to permit his return to us still
sooner than we at present expect. The ery constant
prayer for this, will make you rest secure and happy iu
the belief, that our God is with him wherever he is, as
He is with us, and so give you cheerfulness and courage
to attend to your daily duties, and conquer anything like
too selfish sorrow. Will you try this, love, een if
it be more difficnlt now, than it would have been a few
days ago?'
I will indeed, Mamma,'' and she raised her head from
her mother's sloulder, and tried to smile. sWYhen you

obeyed with alacrity, and finding, when she had once
begun, so many things to get perfect for the gratification
of ler brothers, that ncnly three hours slipped away
quite unconsciously; nnd when Cnrolinc rcturned from
n walk, she was astonishel at the change in her sister,
nnd touched by te affcctionate self-repronch with which
lmmeline, looking p in her face, cxclaimel--
`` Dear Carolinc, I have been so pettish and so cross to
you since Pnpn left, that I am sure you must be quite
tireof me; but I am going to be really a leroine now,
and not a sham sentimcntal one; and bear the pain of
Papa's absence as bravely as you do.''
And she did so; though at first it was, as her mother
had warned her, very difticult to compel the requisite
exertion, which for employment and cheerfulness, was
now necded; but when tle ill is right, there is little fecnr
of failurce.

couraged to isit their nurse, the request was granted
without any surprise, though to the ery last moment
she feared one of her cosins or Miss IInrcourt would
offer to accompany her. Ther were all, however, too oc-
cupied withi and for Mlr., Hnmilton, and shc sought the

Not dnring to say the whole amount whicl she so
urgently required at once, she had only brought with
her the antique gold cross and two or three smaller
ornaments, wlich hal been amongst her mother's
trinkets, and a gold loeket Percy had gien her.
Mrs. Langford was painfully startled. She had uo iden
her promise comprised ncquiescenee and assistance in
any matter so very wrong and mysterious as this; and
she tried eery argument, every persuasion, to prevail on
Ellen to confide all her dificulties to MIrs. IIamilton,
urging that if esen she had done wroug, it could only
call for temporary displeasure, whereas the misclief of
her present proceeding might never come to an cnd,
and must be discoered at last; but Ellen was inexorable,
though cvidently quite as miserable as she was firm,
and MIrs. Langford had too high an idea of the solemn
nature of a pledged word to draw back, or think of
betraying her. She said that of course it night be some
wecks before she could succeed in disposing of them all,
as to offer them altogether, or even at one place, would
be exsposing herself to the most unplcnsant suspicious.

Oe step was thus gained, but nearly a fortuight had
passed, and she heard nothing from the widow.
 Will thcy ncver come?'' exclaimed Emmeline, in
mirthful impatience, one cvening, about four dnys after
her conversation with her mother; `` it ust e past the
hour Perey namcd.''
 It still wnnts half an hour,'' replicl MIrs. IIamilton;
adding, `` that unfortunate drawing, whcn will it succeed
in obtaining your undividod attention ?''
Certninlynot this evening, Mlamma; the only draw-
ing I feel inclined for, is n sketch of my two brothers,
if they would only hae the kindness to sit to me.''
Poor Percy,'' observcl Cnroline drily; `if you are
to be as restless as you have bcen the last hour, Emmcline,
he would uot be very much flattered by his portrnit.''
Now that is very spiteful of you, Cuaroline, and all

But ou will condemn me as an idle, unsteady, hair-

face. Then do let me hare a fellow-sufferer, for I can-
not staud condemation alone. lEllen, do pnt away that

 It won't do, kEmmmy; Ellen has been so perseveringly
industrious since her illness, that I should rather
condemn her for too much application than too great
idleness. But you reall hae been stooping too long
this warm evening, my loe,'' she added, obscrving, as
Ellen, it seemed almost involuntaril, looked up at her
cousin's words, that her cheeks were flushed almost
painfull. Ohlige Emmcline this ouee, and be as idle
as she is: come and talk to me, I have scarccely hearda

There was no.rejoinder to these kind and playful
words. Ellen did indeed put aside her drawing, but
instead of taking a seat near her aunt, wich in forme
days she would hae been only too happy to do, she
walked to the furthest window, and ensconcing erself in
its deep recess, seemed determined to hold communion

had fancied there wns something unusual in her manner,
but the many anxieties nnd thoughts which had cngrossed
her since her lhusbnd's summons and his departurce had
prevented anything, till that evening, but momentary
surprise. Lmmeline's exclamation, that she was quitc
surc she henrl the trampling of horses, and that it must
be Percy, by the helloug way he rode, prevented any
rcmark, and brought them all to the window; and she
was right, for in a few minutes a horseman emerged
from some distant trecs, urging his horse to its utnost
spced, waving his cap in all sorts of nirthful gesticula-
tions oer his head, long before he could be quite sure
that there was anybody to see him. Another minute,
and he hal ilung the reins to Robert with a laughing
greeting, and sprigig p the long fliglnt of steps in

 Were is your wateh, Ellen? and why, if you are
ot wearing it, do yon make us suppose you are?'' in-
terrupted Mrs. IIamilton, startlel out of all idea that
Ellen was changed only in faney.
Ellen was silent, and, to Percy's imagination, so sul-
lenly and insolently so, that he becnme indignant.
 Did you hear my mother speak to you, Lllen why
lon't you answer ?''
`Because I thought my wateh was my own to do what
I Iikced with, to wear or to put away,'' was the reply;
over neither words uor tone of which, had she at that
moment any control, for in her agonized tcrror, she did
ot in the least know what she said.
How dare you answer so, Ellen? Lenve the room,
or ask my motler's pardon at onee,'' replied Percy,
is eyes flashing with such unusual anger, that it terri-
fied her still more, and under the same kind of spell
she was turning to obey him, without attempting the
apology he demanded.
`Sta, Ellen; this extraordinary conduct must not
go on any longer without notice on my part. I have
borne with it, I fear, too long already. Leave us, my
dear Percy; I would rather speak with your cousin
aloue.''
I fear it will be useless, mother; what has comc

What passed in the interrie, which lasted more than
an hour, uo one knew; but to the watchful ees of er
affectionate children, there were tracees of very unusual
listurbance on MIrs. Hamilton's expressie countenance
when she rejoined tem; and the dark rim round Ellen's
eyes, the dcadly pallor of her cheeks and lips, seemed
to denote that it had not been deficient in suffering to
her; though ot one sign of penitence, oue word otf
acknowletgment that she was, aud had been for somc
weeks, in error, by her extraordinary conduct-not een
a softening tear could her aunt elicit. She hal never

Hamilton spoke to her till she was almost exhausted,
for her ow disappointment was most painful, and she
had not a gleam of hope to urge her on. Her conclud-
ing words were these-

vend of a month, I find you persisting in the sme course
of rebellion and defiance, recgardless alike of your duty
to your Gol and to me, I shall adopt soe measurcs to
compel suhmiasion. I had hoped to bring up all my
children under my own eye and by my ow eflorts;
but if I am not permitted so to do, I know my duty
too well to shnink from the alternative. You will no
longer remain uter my care; somc severer guardian
and more rigid discipline may bring you to n sense of
your duty. I advise you to think well on this subject,
Ellen; you know me too well, I tlink, to imagine that

She had loft thc room as she spoke, so thant if Ellen
had intended reply, there was no time for it. But she
could not have spoken. Go from Oakwood, and in

than the lingering torture she wns tln enduring-
better to hide her shame and misery amongst strangers,

became utterly exhausted, and again the spell, the stupor
of indifference, crept over her. She would hasre con-

gravity and ahost gloom, for the conviction of his
master and mistress as to his inocence could not cheer
him, while suspicion against him still actuated Moris,
and mauy of the other servants, would hae called the
young en's attention towards him at once. The
arious paths and glades between the Hall and Mrs.
Inngford's cottage had been so searched, that unless the
storm had destroyed them or blon the notes very far
away, it seemed next to impossible, that tley could not
be found. Mr. Hamilton knew the number of each
note, had told them to his wife, aud gave notice at his
bnnker's, that thougl he did not vish them stopped, he
should likce to know, if possible, when they had passed.
No notice of such a thing had been sent to Oakood,
and it seened cnurious that, if found and appropriated,
they should not yet hae been used, for ten weeks had

now so contrary to her usual habits, that MIrs. IIamilton
coull not help fancying it was to prevent the chance of
being any timc alone with hoer. There had bcen no
change in her manncr, excet a dcgrce more care to
control the disrespectfnl or pcttishanswer ; but nothing
to give hopc that the spirit was changing, and that the
hidden crror, whatever it might be, would be acknow-
lelged and atoned. MIrs. IIamilton was nerving hcr own
mind for the performance of the altocrnatie she had
plnced before her niece; passing many a slcepless night
in painful meditations. If to senl her from Oakwood
were necessary, would it produce the oeffect she wished,
with whom shc could place her, and what satisfactory rea-
son she could assign for doing so. Sc knew there would
be a hndred tongues to cry shame on her for sending
her orphan niecc from her roof, but that was but one
scarcely-tasted bitter drop in the many other sources of
nnxicty. ut still these were but her nightly sorrows;
she might have been paler when sle rose, but though
hcr clildren felt quite sure that Ellen was gricving her
exceedingly, her cheerful sympathy in their enjoyments
nand pursuits necr waned for n moment.
MIorris left her at six o'clock, all his business so
satisfactorily accomplished, tht the old man was quite

head for rcducing difficnlt aeccounts and tangled affnirs

excited, MIrs, lIamilton had cnlled obert and procceded
to the schoolroom to get a pattern of embroidery and
a note, which Cnroline had requested might be scnt to

scatter all its contents over the floor. It was Ellen's.

memorable New Yenr's Ee, and was now the repnository
of her dread secret. It was actually in fragments,
especially where the ink-stands and pens had been, and
the spring broken, the secret drawer burst open, and
nall its contents were disclosed. Robert was much too con-
cerned to think of anything but his own extreme care-
lessness, and is mistress's reprimand; and he busied
himself in hastily picking up the contcnts, and placing
them cnarefullr on the table preparatory to their arrange-
ment byr Mrs. Hamilton in a drawer of the table, which
she was emptying for the purpose. She Inid them
carefully in, and was looking over a book of very nicely-
written French themes, glad there was at least one
thing for which she might be sntisfied with Ellen,
when an exclamation-

to an exclamation of impntience at finding she was

to soothe his troubled spirit.
IIerbert, to look for a poem, the beauty of which he
had been discussing with Miss IIarcourt, during thcir

that she did not wish to bce more eplicit, Ierbert took
his book, and somewhat sorrowfull left her.
Ten minutes more and the massie door unclosed
again, but no step advanced, for the intruder remained
rooted where the door had closcd. It was a very larg
nnd lofty room, with an arched and gothic roof, of
black and frettel oak, the walls and climney-piece of
the same material and most elaborate workmanship. A
sort of dais, remnant of olden times, diided the upper
part of the room by two or three steps fom the lower.
On this dais was the raised reading-desk of supcrbly
cared oak, at whicl MIr. Hamilton ofliciated morning
and evening, and two lihrnry tnblecs of more molern
workmanship stood on each side, bt rather lower
lown. Lxcept the massive oaken chairs and couchcs,

lows, the lower part of the hall, two thirds of the length,
was comparatively unoccupied, showing its vast space
nnd supcrb roof to still greate advantage. The mag-
ificently stained windows, one on te dais, a deep
oriel, threw such subdued light into the room, as
accorded wcell with its oter appointments; but as
evening advaneed, gave it that sort of soft holy light,
whichi always impresses thc spirit witl a species of
awe.
We do not tlink it was that fecling alone which so
overpowered the second intruder, as to arrest her spell-
bound on the thrcshold. Mrs. Hamilton was seated at
one of the tables on the dais nearest the oriel window,
tle liglt from which fcll full on her, giving her figure,
though she was seatcd naturally enough in one of the
large, maroon velvet, oaken chairs, an unusual effeet of
dignity and commnand, and impressing the terrifiel
belolder with such a scensation of awe, tlat had her life
depended on it, she could not for that one minute have
gone forwnrd; nd even when desired to do so by the
wOTds-

she walked thc whole length of that iuterminable room,
and stood facing her aunt, she never knew.
MIrs. IIamilton for a full minute did not speak, but
she fixed that searching look, to whieh we have onee
before alluded, upon Ellen's face; and then said, in a
tone, which, though very low and cnlm, expressed as
much as that earnest look-

are here - neccssnry to produce the proof that my
words are right, and that you hte been influenced by
the fearful effccts of some unconfessed and most heinous
sin? Little did I dream its nature.''
For a moment Ellen stood as turned to stone, as
white and rigid-the nest she had sunk down with a
wild bitter cry at Mrs. Hamilton's feet, and buried her
face in ler hands.
Is it true-can it be true-that you, offspring of
my own sistcr, dcar to me, cherished by me as my own
child,-you hae bcen the guilty one to appropriate,
and conccal the appropriation of money, which has
been a source of distress by its loss and the suspicion
thence proceeding for the last seven weeks -that you
could listen to your uncle's words, absoling is vholc
household as incapable of a deed which was actual tleft,
and et by ueither word nor sigu betray remorse or
guilt?-could behold the innocent suflering the fearful
misery of suspicion, loss of character, without the power
of clearing imself, and stand calmly, heellessly by-
only proing by our hardened and rebellious temper
that all was not right within-Ellen, cn this be
true?':
Yes'' was the reply, but with sucl a fearful effort,
that her slight frame shook as with an ague; ``thank
God, that it is known. I dared not bring down the
punishment on myself, but I can hear it.''
 This is mere ockery, Ellen; low dare I helieve
een this poor evidence of repentance, with the recol-
lection of your past eonduct? What were the notes

96
IIoME INLUENCE.
Ellen named them.
 Where are they ?-This is but one, and tle

Ellen's answer was scnrcely audible,
eUsed them-and for what ?2''
There was no answer, neither then, nor when Mrs.
IIamilton sternly reiterated the question. She then
demanded-
How long hae they been in yor posasession ?''
 Fie or six weeks,'' bnt the reply was so tremulous,
it carried no conviction with it.
 Siunce Robert told his story to your uncle, or
beforet
efore.''
Then your last answer was a falsohood, Ellen; it is
full seven weeks since my husband addressed the house-
hold on the subject. You could not have so miscounted
time, with such a deed to date by. Where did you find
them ?'
Ellen described the spot.
 And what business had you there?' You know
that neither you nor your cousins are ever allowed to
go that way to hIrs. Langford's cottage, and more espe-
cially alone. If you wnnted to see her, why did you
not go the usual way ? And wlen was this?-you must
remember the cxact day. our emory is not in
general so trencherous.''
Again Ellcn was silent.
 IIave you forgotten ite?
She croucled lowcer at her aunt's fcet, but the answer
was audible-
N
HOIE INFLLENCE.
97
 Then answer me, Ellen, this moment, and distinctly;
for what purpose were you seeking MIrs. Langford's
cottage by that forbidden path, and when?''
eI wanted money, and I went to ask her to take
my trinkets-my watch, if it must be-and dispose of
them as I had rend of others doing, as miserable as I
was, nnd the wind blew the notes to my ery hand, and
I used them. I was mad then-I have been mad since,
I believe; but I would have rcturned the whole amount
to Rohert, if 1I could but have parted with my trinkets
in time.''
To dcscribe the tone of utter despair, thc reck-
lessncss as to the effect her words would produce,
is impossible. Eery word increased MIrs. Hamilton's
bewilderment and misery. To suppose that Ellcn did
not feel was folly. It was the cry depth of wretehed-
ness which was crushing her to the earth, but eery
answered and unanswered question but deepened the
mystery, and rendered her judge's task more difhieult.
And when was this, Lllen? I ill hae uo more
easion-tell me the cxact day.''
But she asked in ain. lllen remained moveless,
and silent as the dead. After several minutes, MIrs.
IIamilton removed her hands from her face, and com-
pelling her to lift up her head, gazed searchingly on
her deathlike countenance for some moments in utter
silence, and then said, in a tone that Ellen never in her
life forgot-

deem your sin. One ard one oly path is open to you,
for all that you have said and loft unsaid but deepcns
your apparent guilt, und so blackens your conduct,
that I can scarcely believe I am addressing the child I
so loved-nnd conld still so loe, if but one real sign be
given of remorse and penitence-one hope of returning
truth. But that sign, that hope, can only be a full
confession. Toerrible as is the guilt of appropriating so
large a sum, granted it came by the merest chance into
your hand; dark as is the additional sin of concelment
wlen an innocent person was suffering,-something still
darke more terrible, must be concealed behind it, or
you would not, could not, continue thus obdurately
silent. I can helieve that under some heavy pressurc
of misery, some strong excitement, the sum might have
been used without thought, and that fear might ave
preventcd te confession of anything so dreadful ; bnt
what was this heavy ecessity for money, this strong
excitement? What feanful and mysterious difficunlties
hare you been led into to call for either? Tell me the

of saving you and myself tle misery of publicly declaring

Tell me what difficulty, what misery so maddened you,

Oh, that I coull'' was the reply in such bitter
anguish, MIrs. Hamilton actually shuddered. :`But I
cnOt-must not-dare not. Aunt Emmeline, hate me,
condemn me to the severest, sharpest suftering; I wish
for it, piue for it: you cannot loathe me more than I do

tones-I cannot bear them. It was because I kncw

 Dare not'' repeated Mrs. IIamilton, mnore and
more hewildered, and, to conceal the emotion Ellen's
wild words and agonized manner had produced, adopt-
ing greater steruness.  You dare commit a sin, from
which the lowest of my household would shrink in
horror, and yet tell me you dare not make the only
atonement, give me the only proof of real penitence, I
demand. This is a weak and wicked subterfuge, lEllen,
and will not pass with me. There can be no reason
for this fearful obduracy, not even the consciousness of
greater guilt, for I promise forgiveness, if it be possible,
on the sole condition of a full confcssion. Once more,
will you spcak? Your hardihood will be utterly uscless,
for you cannot hope to conquer me; and if you perit
me to leae you with your conduct still clothed in this
impenetrable mystery, you will compel me to adopt
measures to subdne that defying spirit, as will cxpose
you and myself to intense suffering, but which must
force submission at last.''

use to which it was anpplied, te reason of your choosing

and laid it on the table-`I will remain here one hnlf

Ellen rose slowly and painfully, and seating herself
at the table, some distance fom hcr aunt, leaned her
arms upon it, and buried her face within them. Never

for Edwuard, but then clear as held before her in letters of
fire she read every word of her brother's desperate letter,
particularly ` Breathe it to my uncle or aunt, for if
she knows it, he will, and you will never see me more.''
Her mother, pallidt as death, seemed to stand before her,
freezing contfession on her heart and lips, looking at
her tlreateningly, as she had so often seen her, as if tle
very thought were guilt. . The rapidly alvancing tvi-
light, te large and lonely room, all added to that fearftul
illusion, and if kEllen did succeed iu praying, it was with
desperate fervomr for strength, not to betray her
brother. If ever there were a martyr spirit, it was
enshrined in that young frail form.
But how could MIrs. Hamilton imagine this IIow
could her wildest fancy bring kdward-the brave, hapy,
eager Edward, of wlom captain, officers, and crew
wrote in such terms of praise and admiration, who ad
neer gien cause for anxiety, and who was so far
distant-as the uniting link to this terrible mystery?
Was it not more natural that he should not enter the
incongruous and painful thoghts floating through
her brain, save as her last resouree, by his influence to
obtain the truth from Ellen? The more sle thought,
the more agonizing her thoughts bhecame; what could
induce this determined silence but a conviction of
deeper guilt, and what conld that guilt he? The most
terrible suspicions crossed her mind; she had heard,
though she had scarcely belieed in them, of entangle-
ments, even where the guardianship had been most rigid.
Could one so young, seemingly so innocent, have fallen
into the power of some desperate character, who was

choosing that forbidden path which was never by any
chance trolden by the family or their friends, her
constant desirc lately not to join them in their ex-
cursions, prefcrring, and often finding some excuse to
remain alonc-all came to Irs. HIamilton's mind with
sch an overpowering sensation of dread and misery,
thmat the worst guilt Ellen could have avowed would
scarcely hae been worse than anticipation pictured;
and yet every thought was so raguc, every fancy so nn-
defined--there was nothing she could grasp at as a
saing hopc, or in the remotest degree cxcusing cause,;
sueh obdurate silence in one so young, generally sa
yielding, could and must conceal nothing but still more
fearful sin. The darkness which had gathered round
thcm, save the brightening light of the hnrvest moon,
suddenly awakenel her to the lapse of time. The
moonlight fell full on the faee of the watch, which was
n repeater. It wanted but three minutes more, and
Mrs. Hamilton watched the progress of tle hnd with
such sickening dread, that when it renchel the hour,
she had scarcely strength to strike it, and so gie
notice-for words she had none-that the hour of gracc
had passed. But she conqucrcd the powerlessness, and
those soft chimes which, wlen Ellen first came to Oak-
wood, hnd been such a constant source of childish
wonderand ilelight, now rang in her enrs louder, hoarser,
more fenrfully istinct than even those of the ancient
time-piece in the hall, which at the snme moment rang
out the hour of cight.

103
The sounds ceased, and vith heightened dignity, but in
perfect silence, MIrs. Hamilton rose, passed her niece,
and had nearly reached the door, when she paused, and
turned towards Ellen, as if irresolute. Ellen's eyes had
watched her as in fascination, and the pause endowed
her with just sufficient power to spring forward, fling
herself at her aunt's feet, and clasping her knees
with all her little remaining strength, passionately im-
plore-
Aunt Emmeline, Aunt Emmeline, speak to me but
one word, only one word of kindness before you go. I
do not ask for mercy, there can be none for such a
wretch as I am; I will benr without one complaint, one
murmur, all you may inflict-you cannot be too severe.
Nothing can be such agony as the utter loss of your
affection; I tought the last two months, that I feared
ou so much, that it was all fear, no love, but now, now
that ou know my sin, it has all, all come back, to
make me still more wretched,'' and before Mrs. Hamilton
could prevent, or was in tbe least aware of her intention,
Ellen had obtained possession of one of her hands, and
was coering it with kisses, while hor whole frame
shook ith those conulsed but completely tearless
sobs.
 II you confess, Ellen, if I sta ? Wll you gise
me the proof that it is such agony to lose my aflec-
tion, that you do love me as you profess, and thiat
it is only one sin which has so changed you 
one word, and, tardy as it is, I will listen, and if I can,
forgise.''
Ellen made no answer, and MIrs. Hamilton's newly-

raised hopes anishel; she waitcd full two or three
minutes, then gently disegaged er hand and dress
from Ellen's still convulsive grasp; the door closed with
a sullen, scemingly unwilling sound, and Ellen was
alone. Shc remained in the snme posture, the same
spot, till a vague cold terror so took possession of her,
that the room seemed filled with ghostly shapes, and all
the articles of furpiture suddcnly transformed to things
of lifel and springing up with the wild fleet step of fear,
she paused not till she found herself in her own room,
where, flinging herself on her bed, she buried her face
on her pillow, to shut out every object-ol, how she
longed to shut out thoughtl
It was such a different scene, such a fulncss of
innocent joy, on which MIrs. Hamilton entered, that
though she thought erself nerved to control all
visible emotion, the contrast almost overpowered her;
knowing, too, that the fatal oeffects of one person's
sin must banish that innocent enjoyment, aud would
fall on them all as some fearful, joy-destroying blow.
The room, one of thc least spacious, was cheerfully
lighted, the urn hissing on the table, at which Caroline
as usual was presiding, only waiting for her mother's
appearance to sntisfy Percy, who was loudly declaring
he was famished in two senses, for want of lus mother's
company, and of some restorative for his craving ap-
petite. IIe was louging on the sofa, playing with
Emmeline's ilowing ringlets, as she sat on a low stool
by his side, chatting with him, in as discursivc a
strain as his fancy willed. Herbert and Miss IIarcourt
were still in earnest discussion on their poem, from

even Percy and Emmeline, would pause involuntarily
to listen.

Herbert at the same momeut, to get tlieir mother a

long after a water-excursion, must have caused you to be

 Wat that wc must be all famished? I assure you,
we are, and the loss of your sociely sharpened the pangs
of hunger. I owe Morris a grudge, and will certainly
sere him out one day, for detaining you so long when
I wanted you.''
It was not MIorris, that detained me,'' answered
MIrs. Hamilton, somewhat lurrielly. I had done with
him by six o'clock; but come, tell me something about
your excursion,'' she added, eidently anxious to elude
farther remark, and perceiing at once tlat MIiss Harcourt

flute sound on the water, Perey? Ierbert, lI see, has

you any more sketches to fill up?''
Her children eagerly entercd on their day's enjoy-
ment-Herbert conquering his anxiety to emulate his
mother's calmness, but Miss Hareourt had been too
painfully startled by the unusunl expression of forcibly-
controlled suffering on her friend's face, to do so with
any suceess. Nenrly an hour, however, passed ani-
matedly as usual; each fotnd so mucl to tell, and
Percy was in such wild spirits, that it was utterly im-
possible for there to be anything like a pause. Tea
had always been a favorite meal at Oakwood, as bring-
ing all the family together after the various busincss of
the day, and it continued to be so. They had lingered
oer it as usul, when Caroline suddenly exclaimed-
e WVat has become of Ellen? I had quite forgotten
her till this moment; how neglectful she will think usl
Do ring the hell, Percy, that we may send and let her

If she hss no recollection of menal-time, I really
think we need not trouble ourselves about her,'' was
Perey's half-jesting half-earnest reply, for Ellen's
changed manner to his mother had made him more
angry with her, and for a longer time together than he
had ever been with anybody, especially a woman, in his
life. He stretched out his hand, however, to ring the
bell, but Mrs. IIamilton stopped him.

of almost anguish, that eery one of that happy party
startled and looked at her with the most unfeigued alarm,
and Perc, every thought of jest and joyousness checked,
threw his arms round her, exclaiming--
 MIother, dearest what las happened?-that un-
happy girl again. I am sure it is. Why do you not
cast her off from your heart at once; she will bring you
nothing but sorrow for all your loe.''
Perc, how can you be so harsh.-how unlike you''
exclaimed Emmcline, indignantly, as MIrs. Hamilton's
head for a few minutes of natural weakness sunk on her
son's encircling arm. e We have all given MIamma
trouble and pain enough one time or other, and what
would hase become of us if she had cast us offl and
Ellen has no mother, too-for shame ''
 Hh.'' answered Percy, almost sternly, for there
were times when he could quite throw off the boy.
This is no light or commou matter to affect my
mother thus. Shall we send for MIr. Howard, motler?'
he continued, fondly; `'in my father's absence he is
your ahlest friend-we can only feel, not counsel.''
But there are times when feeling can aid in bringing
back control and strength, when counsel alone would
seem so harsh and cold, we can only veep before it;

assumption of protecting manliness in Percy, so touch-

though still holing his hand, as if its very pressure
was support, she was cnabled cnlmly to relate the fntal
discovery of that evening. Its etfect was, in truth, ns
if a thunderbolt had fallen in the midst of them. An
execration, forcibly checkcd, but passionate as his na-
ture, burst from tle lips of Percy, as he clasped his arm
close round his mothcr, as thus to protect her from the
misery he felt himself. HIerbert, with a low cry of pain,
buried his face in his hands. Cnroline, shocked and
bewildered, but her first thought for her mother, could
only look at, and fcl for hcr, quite forgetting that her
every prejudice against Ellcn did indeed seem fulfilled.
Emmeline at first looked stunned, then sinking down at

Percyl dear Percyl do not speak and judge so

but if we ever should find that there is some extenuating
clause, how unhappy we shall be for having judged her
still more hnrshly than she deseroed.''
It is impossible wc can do that,'' muttered Percy,
continuing his angry walk.  Nothing, but guilt can
be the cause of her keeping anything from my mother.

but very sorrowfully, not at all as if she triumphed in
her own previous penetration; ``but she cannot per-
severe in it long. Denr MIamma, do not look sa
distressed: it is impossible she can resist you for any
length of time.''
 She has resisted every offer of kindness, my dear
child, and it is the difficulty as to what course to pursue,
to compel submission an confession, that so griees
and perplexes me,''
 Let me seek MIr. IIoward, dearest Mother,'' an-
swered Herbert; `` he is so good, so kind, even in his
severest judgments, that I really tink Ellen will scarcely
be able to,persevere in her mistaken silence, if he speak
to er.''
Mrs. IIamilton paused for some moments in thought.
I beliee you are right, lerbert. If I must ase
counsel out of my own family, I cannot go to a kinder,
wiser, or more silent friend. If the fearful shame which
I must inflict on Lllen to-night of proving Hobert's
innocence before my whole household, by tle denounce-
ment of her guilt, hae no flect in softening her, I
will appeal to him.''
 Oh, Mamma, must this be-can you not, will you
not, spare her tlis?'' imnplorel Emmeline, clinging to
her mother, in passionate entreaty; ``it would lill mc,
I know it would. Do not-do not expose her to such
shame.''
`'Do you think it is no suffering to my mother to bc

his mother could reply.  Shamel she has shamed us
all enough. Tlere wants little more to add to it,''
But Emmeline's blue eyes neer mored from her
mother's face, and Miss IIarcourt, longing to spare Irs.
Hauilton tle suffering of such a proceeding, tried to
persuade her to evade it, but she did not succeed.
 One word of confession-one evidcenee that her sin
origiuated in a momentary temptation, that it conceals
nothing darker-one real proof of penitence, and God
knows how gladly I vould lave spared myself and her;
but as it is, ucy, Emmeline, do not make my duty
hrder.''
Few as these words were, the tone that spoke them
was enough. No more was said, and MIr. Hamilton
tried, but with very little success, to turn her children's
thoughts to other and pleasanter things. Time seemed
to lag eavily, and yet when the prayer bell sounded,
it fell on every heart as some fearful knell which must
have heen struck too soon.
All were assembled in the library, and in their respee-

Ii excitement whiclh reigned in the servants' hall,
nfter they had witldrawn in the most respcctful silence
from the library, was extreme. Robert, utterly unable
to realize relicf in this proof of his own innocence, could
only pace the hall in agony, dceploring his mad careless-
ness, which, by exposing to temptation, had caused it
all; and Morris and Ellis deepened thc remorse by per-
fectly ageeing with him. Before thcy scparated, thc
old steward called them all together; and, his voice
trembling with agitation, the tcrs nctully running
down his furrowed cheeks, told them that cven as their
mistress had done her duty to the utmost, ay, more
than the utmost by them-for it must have welluigh

that time would clear up the remainder; he never would
believe the grandchild of his mistress's father, one she
hal so loved and cnred for, could wilfully act as ap-
pearances seemed to say; that he was sure one day or
other tley would all find there was much more to pity
than to blame; and till tlen, if they hal the least spark

But whatever the future, the presentwas only suffering;

 This rebellious spirit must be conquered,'' e said,

Iiss Harcourt, hal most anxionsly and yet hopefully
waitel te result of his interference. e We should
aetually be sharing her sin, if we permit hecr to conquer
us by obduracy nnd sclt-will. olitary confinement and
complete idleness may bring her to n better temper, and,
in fact, shiould be persisted in, till a full confession be
made. If that fail, my dear Mrs. IIamilton, your niece
should be banisled from Oakwood. She must not
remaia here, a continual source of anxiety and misery to
you, and of successful hardihood to herself; but of that
there ill be time enough to think when you hase an
answer from Mr. Hamilton; his judgment from a dis-
tance ma be wiser than ours on the spot, and irritated
as we are by such unaccountable obstinacy, in one we

And it was this incomprehensible change of character
in sceming, that still ore perplexsed MIrs. HIamilton,

Closely connected wi(h ElIis's priate apartments, and

turing one into a sitting-room, which lEllis's active care
speedily aecomplished. IIer mistress inspccted them, at
her dcsire, suggested one or two additional comforts,
and thcn held a long confidential conversation with hcr.
She had such perfect confidence in her (for Ellis had
been from a child,-married, and becomc motler and
widow, and married hcr children,-all as nn inmatc of
the Hamilton family, and had leld thc confidential post
of housekeeper for sixteen years) that she did not hesi-
tatc onc moment to commit lEllen entirely to her care,
nt lcast till she could receive an answcr about her from
her husband. She depended on her to watch oter her
ealth, to see that she took daily exsercise with her,
in those parts of the park wlere she was not likely to
attract notice, as bcing with her instead of with any
member of her family, and that she took hcr regular

But Percy' s watchful cnre had so quietly interposed,
that his other found herself in tleir usual sitting-room.,
and in thc midst of thcm all, before she could scck
Ellen; and when, with half reproach, she told him,
that she had still a most painful duty to accomplisl,
therefore e ought not to ave prevented it, he answered
impetuously-
Mother, you shnll not see Ellen any more alonel she
has madc you miserable eough already, and cach time
that she sees you, her deceitful appearance of remorse and
suffering, for they cannot be real, or she would spcak,
but add to it; send for her here, and tell her your de-
cision before us all.''
And MIrs. IIamilton complied, for she felt as ifher firm-
ness would be less likely to fail, than if Ellen attempted
anything like supplication with her alone, But not a
word of supplication came. Ellen had answered the
summons, by quietly accompanying Ellis, wlo had been
sent for her, to her aunt's presenee, pale, indecd, as
marble, but so tearless and still, as to seem unmoved.

that his inlluence might awaken her to a sense of the

Ellen wildly implored-

Horbert wns leaning at the baek of Mre. HInilton's

her tears were utterly spoiling.)

turned hastily away, een his anger in part subdued,
and MIrs. Hamilton could scnrcely reply.
I cannot grant your request, Ellen, for to refuse
it appcars to me the onl means of softening you. It
ay be a full fortnight before I can write to Edward,
for we must recceie letters first. If during that intecrval
you choose to give me the only proof of repentance that
can satisfy me, or bring the lcast hope of returning hap-
piness to yourself, I shall kuow ho to act. I would
indeed spre your brother this bitter shame, but if you
eontinue thus obdurate, no entrenties will moe mc.
Rise, and go with Ellis. Punislment and mieery, rc-
pentanee and pardon, are all before ou; you alone can
choose. I shall interfere no more, till our uncle's sen-
tence comes'' And longing to cnd this painful scene,
for her mistress's sake, Ellis led Ellen from the room,
and conducted her to the apartments assigncd her, She
felt much too angry and annoyed at the pain and trouble
Ellen was giving her mistress, to eince anything like
lciudness towards her at first, but she had not been under
her care above a week before her feelings underwent a
complcte change.
Sulfering as she was enduring, more especially from
the coiction, that to eery one of tlose she loed (for
affection for each one of the family had now returned
with almost passionatc violcncc) she must be an object
of hate and lonthing, yet thnt her sin was kown, wasa
relief so inexpressibly blcssed, she felt strengthened to
endure everything clsc. She lkne, and her God kncw,

strauge comfort in that; though she knew uo punishment
could be too severe for thc sin itself, and shc prayed con-
stantly to be enabled to benr it, and still not to hetray
her brothcr; and tle consequece of these pctitions was
a calm, gentle, deeply submissie dcmeanour. Not a
murmur ever passed hcr lips, and Ellis scarcely ever
saw the signs of tears, whicl she longed for; for the
quiet, but fearfully intense suffcring, Ellen's very evident
daily portion, alarmed her for its effect upon hcr always
delicate health. As yct, howeer, there was no outward
appearance of its fuiling, it rather bore up from the ces-
sation of tle nervous dread, and constaut terror which
she had endured before; and before Mlr. Hamilton's
letter arived, an month after thce fatal discoery, Ellis had
drawn her own conclusions, and her manuer, instead of
being distant and cold, had become so excessively lind
and feeling, that the poor gil felt some leavy change
must be impending, she dared not look to the continu-
ance of such comfort.
But Mrs. IIamilton never saw her nicce, save when
no wods could pass between them; and she could not
judge as Ellis did. Sle could only feel, as each day
passed, without hringing the desired proof of sorrow
and amendment, more and more bewilered, and ery
wretched. hough, for her children's sake, sle so con-
quered the feeling as, after the first wcek, to restore
chcerfulness, and promote the various amusements thcy
ad all so enjoyed. Lllen's disappcnrnnce had of coursc
to be accounted for, to the intimate frionds with whom
they so constantly were; but her ackowlcdgment that
she had been disnppointed in her, and that hcr conduet

would not allow hcr any social or domestic indulgence,
atleast for a time, satisfied the elder members. Annie,
for the first time, discoered that Caroline was her
match in cleverness, merely from her excessive truth and
simplicity, and that mncuvre as she might, she could
not discovcr the smallest clue to this sudlen mystery.
And Mlary, for the first timc, and on this one subject
alone, found IHerbcrt and Emmeline impenetrably
rcserved.
As soon as Mrs. Langford had been informed by her
son, at his mistress's desire, of the unanswerable proof
of his innoeence, shc hastencd to te Hall, and requesting
a pivate interiew with MIrs. kamilton, placcd at once
in ler hands all the trinkets and watch, with wlich she
had bccn at diffcrcnt times intrustcd; related all that
ad passed between her and MIiss Tortescuc, the ex-
cessivec isery she seemed to be enduring; and confessed
that the few pounds she had given her, as the sums
obtained by the sale of tho trinkets, she had adanced
herself, having resolved that nothing should induce hen
to dispose of them, and that of course it as the diffi-
culty she had in advancing their right salue, which had
oceasioned the length of time that had elapsed since
Ellen had first sought hcr.
 Would it not go far to prove she really did ish to
return the money ?'' MIrs. Hamilton thought, long after
thec widow had left hcr, and the sums she had advanced
retrncd with interest.  Was it to return the fatnlly
appropriated sum, or because she needed morcl Ellen
lad so positiely, and with such agony asserted the
first, tlmat it was scarcely possible to disbeliee her; but

wat wans this fenful diflieultr, this pressing demnnd
by one so young fo so much money?' WYhy, if it were
comparatively innocent, would she not speake?'' Tla
morc she thought the more perplexecd and anxious she
seemed to become. The aot itself of endenvouring to
disposc of the trinkets, especially those tht had bcen
given and reeeived, as loubly vnlunble hecnuse they hand
been woru by her mother, wonld have bccn sufficiently
faulty to have occasioned natural displeasure, but com-
pared with other kown and unknown faults, it sunk
into almost nothing. Mrs, Hnmilton collected them all
together, those Mrs. Langford had returued, and the
few remaining in her niece's drawer, annd crefully put
them away, till circumstances might authorise her re-
turning them to Ellen, and etermined on saying nothing
more on the suhject either to Ellen or her own family.
One thing Ellis reported to her regarding Lllen,
which certainly seemed like a consciousness of the
wrong she had done kRobert, and a wish to atone for it.
She begged Ellis so earuestly that she might see him, if
it were only for fie minutes, that she could not resist
her, and when he came, she implored him so touchingly,
so pleadingly, to forgive her long silence himself, and
entrcat his mother to lo so too; assuring him, that it
was the hope of bcing able to restore the notes to him,
without revenling he identity, which hnd caused
the silence, that it was scnrccly possible to listen to
her unmosed. It was no false humility, but the deepest
most unieigned contrition for having becn the cause of
injury.
Ten days after Ellon's imprisonment, the letter

arrived fron Si ElwardMlanly, wlieh MIrs. Hamilton had
alluded to as ecessary to be eceived, before sle could
write to her nephew, and the news it brought, thogh
somewhat alloed, would at another time have been
eceived wvith the greatest delight. Edward was re-
turning. In tlree weeks, or a month the utmost, after
the receipt of his conander's letter, he might bc witl
themu all; invlidel home for a thce or four months'
lcave. here hnd been another and rather severe en-
gagement, in which young Fortescue had still more
distiuguished himself; but from his headlong courage
had been severely, but not at all scriously, hurt. Sir
Edward intended sending the pirate frigate which they
had taken, to Egland, as she was a tight-built, well-
looking craft enogh, he wrote, if manncd witl honorable
men instead of desperate villains; and had nominated
Harding and Fortescue to accompany the sccond lieu-
tenant, as her officers.
The name of Harding produced no disagreeable remi-
iscences in Mrs. Hamilton's mind. It had been so
very long since Eward had even mentioned him, tlat
she had almost forgotten his early fancy for him. Hen
only thought now wns thmanlfulness that her gallant
nephew had been preseved, and that he was coming
home. It could scnrcely be pleasure she feclt, though
all the young party did, for there was such an excite-
mcnt in Edward's courage, and in his having been in
two dcesperate engagemcnts, and seen so mucl, that with
the buoyancy happily natural to well-disposed youth, they
eould only tink andtlk of his return, forgettingthe alloy

with him at least a week or ten days. If delayed, he
would vcry provokingly just arrive, as they would be re-
turning to college.
After much painful deliberation, MIrs. IIamilton dcter-
mined on making IIerbert her messenger with these un-
expccted tidiugs to llen; hoping more thnn shc ex-
pressed tlat his gentle eloquencce in bringing bcfore her
the misery to which she must condemn her brotler it
she would persist in tlis silence, and so compel an
appeal to him, would have some effect; cspecially as she
charged him to impress upon her, that even now confes-
sion should bring pardon, and coucealment of all from
Eward. Herbert gladly undertook the mission, and sa
feelingly, so earnestly disclarged it, tlat poor Ellen felt
more lenrt-broken than she hal done yct, and almost
incapable of retaining her firmness. But she did; for
danger to kEdwarl seemed more imminent now tht he
was coming home, to the very icinity of his drended
unele, than when he was nat n distancc. She conld only
feel thnkful-if concealmeut were iudeed so absolutely
necessary as he lad leclared it to be-that MIr. IIamilton
was still from home, and might continue to be so during
Edward's visit. It was diflicult to repress the sickening
shudder, when Herbert chauced to mention that IIarding
was her brother's comanion in his voyagc hoe, and
lifficult, not to express more ddisappointmucut than the

long interview, deeply grieved at the failure of all his
persuasious, all his remoustrances, but compelled, he
could not satisfactorily explainu why, either to himself
or lis family, to pity fnr more than to blame. Percy
declared, as did Caroline and Miss Harcourt, that it
must be ouly his own too kind and gentle disposition,
which neer could blame anybody or anything. Irs.
Hamilton was bitterly disappointed; MIr. Howard in-
sisted that sucl obduracy demanded nothing but the
sternest treatment, and he only wished MIr. Hamilton's
letter could arrie at once. He saw Ellen again himself
twice in the fire weeks, hich elapsed between the disco-
very of her sin and the arrial of Mr. Hamiltou's anser;
bnt if kindness had so failed, it was comparatively easy
to esist his well-intentioned, but in this case utterly
mistaken sternness, He wasin general so kind, een in
is judgments, that MIrs. IIamilton thought he must
hare some reason to heliece Ellen so thoroughly hard-
cned, and from his report of her, was enabled to impart
her husband's seutence with more firmness, than had she
listened to her own kind still loving heart
It was as sle and Mr. Howard nd both expected.
Ellen was no longer to remain at Oakwood, but to be
plaeed under the care of a maiden lady, liing in York-
shire, a relation of Mr. Hanilton, and one who had
occnsionally visited Oakwood, and was therefore well
kuow to MIrs. Hamilton, and to Ellis too, and regarded
ith such dislike by the latter, as to make her actually

breathcl-honest, straightforward, truth-speaking lite-
rally to a fault, but as hard as she was true. Whethcr
she cver had any feclings or not, MIrs. Hamilton, with
nll her penetration, never conuld discover; but thc good
she did was inense in practical benevolence, thougl
the quick sympathy, tlc kindly word, the iudulgent
thonght seemed uttcrly unknown. She had no pity for
faults or failings, always declaring forbearance and love
wcre all folly; `` if a brnnch wvere in tle slightest degree
decayed, cut it of; if the blight extend to the root,
lestroy it,'' sle was fond of saying. As for youthful
follies or errors, she had no paticnce witl them, for
neer having been, or rnther felt young herself ,she
could not understand the age in others. Ellis hnd not

under this very disagreeable exterior: MIrs. IIamilton

sufficiently excusing, as to demand the avoidance of his
sentence altogether.
Mliss Seldon's last visit to Oakwood was sufficiently
well reemerel by the young hailtons, (though it
wcs before their cousins ad arried from India,) for
them all,-even Percy and Caroline, the most indignant
against Ellen,-to think of their father's sentence with
the deepest regret, and with almost dread for its effect
on Ellen.
If she did but know her, she must speak,'' was
Emmeline's exclamation. I did not feel quite sure
that I wsas my own happy self, all the time she was
with us.''
 The atmosphere was frozen twenty degrees belo
zero in all the rooms she frequented, though it was
otherwise a hot summer,'' rejoined Percy; ``and in
Yorkshire--''
Pray do not joke, dear Perc; I cannot bear to
think of Ellen going away from us at all, much less to
such a guardian, though I know she is rery good,''
answered Herbert.

for Nanc Seldon; she was the only person in the

though I fear even confession would not help her much
now,''
Mlrs. Hnmilton might and did think with them all,
but she could not swerve from her duty. She wrote at
once to MIiss Seldon, not entering into particulnrs, but
merely asking if she would consent to take charge of a
yong relative, whose conduct demanded more rigid
watchfuluess and care, and an entire cessation of in-
dulgence, than could be the case in the family circle at
Oakwood. She and her husband had sucl perfect con-
fidence in her, she said, that if she could oblige them
by undertakiug the duty, they knew, without any
assurance on hcr part, that she would discharge it faith-
fully. The yearly sum they offered was large, becnusc
they wished their young relative to have all the com-
forts and appurtenanctes of a gentleworan, and thc
advantages of the best elucation, the city near which
she residcd, could afford. Ms. IIamilton had no doubt
of the affirmative nature of the reply, for Miss Seldon
owed the recovery of er fortune and position entirely
to the cxertions of Mr. Hamilton, and she had told him,
once for all, that if she could but sere or oblige him in
any way, great or small, it would make her far happier
than she had cer been, or wns likely to be in her solitary
life. The letter written and despatched, Mrs. Hamilton
summonced Ellen once more to hcr presence.
The scene was again the library, where she hnd been
writing, and the time nearing the short twilight of
Octaber. It was three weeks, rather morce, siuce Sir

with which his unhappy sister looked to his return it
would be a rain attemt to define. At times the
intense longing to see him again, caused a wild almost
sick feeling of pleasure, that she miglt perhaps so soon
do so; then came all that had passed, and she picturcl
his anger, his loathing-true, it had been for him, but
he had not thought of sucl a deed. He would, he
must hate and spurn her, too, and the idea of meeting
him became absolute agony. Then-and she shuldere
in drend-would he think that he must acknowledge it
was for him she had thus acted? and, if so, had she not
betrayed instead of saing bim? Incident after incident
in their childhood rose before hcr, to give her ope that
he would be silent now, as tlen, and not betray him-
self; but these contending terrors, united witl the con-
stant though silent suffering of her banishment from all
she loved, the utter hopelessness as to the end of this
trial, had not bcen without their cffect on the outward
frame. Ellis did not see it, from so constantly vatching
her, and from Ellen neer refusing to take the exercise
she desired her, and not making a single complaint as
to the pain it was sometimes to walk, and always to
swallow her meals ; but as she stood opposite to her
aunt, in the full light of the oriel indo-her ap-
proach had been so noiseless, MlIrs. Hamilton, who was
benling over some papers, did not see her, till she
clanced to look up-the attenuation of form and feature
was so very isible, that her aunt could not preent hersclf
from starting painfull, and the words with wlich she
had intcnded to address hcr froze on her lips. It as
with the utmost difficulty she refrained from folding ler

to her heart, and trying, by every means allection could
devise, to soothe or remove that anguish, whatever its
nature, far too dceep and constant for one so vcry young
but how dared she do tlis, when by this determined
silence Ellen so deficd her authority, and seemed so
resoled that ncither severity nor kindness, nor her own
sutferings shoull humble hcr spirit, though they had
cven affected her frame.
Conquering with a powerfl effort the pleadings of
affection, MIrs. Hamilton calmly entered on the subject
for which she had summoned her, rcading to her a
greater part of her uncle's letter, hoping that its severity
would spare her the pain of any additional remarks.
Every word seemcd to buru itself on llen's brain.
What sle had hoped sle knew not, for she thought shc
had neer hoped at all, but the words,  No cnuse can
be excusing cnongh to prevent the entire setting aside

thought ad entered her mind, if thc real cause were
by any chance discovercd would she be forgien,
and in time restodred to confidence and love? And
now it was oer, cven that hope was gone
Mrs. Hamilton paused for a cply or an obseration,
but none came, and sle continued inprcssively--:I
can scarccly hope, Ellen, that as cen the idea of

would have urged you to speak directly. I cau believe
tis no longer; but as I wish you to be with Edward,
at least part of his stay with us, I shall postpone your
leaviug us, one month from to-day. If, indeed, lEdward's
infliuence bc such that, for his sake, you will make me a
full confession and answer clenrly and distinctly every
question I put to you, your residence with Migs Seldon
shall be limited to three, six, ten, or twele months,
aecording to the nature of the motie of this incompre-
hensible and, apparently, most sinful conduct. If you
leave us still obdurate, years will, in all probability, pass
before we can feel sufficiently confident in the restored
integrity ad openness of your character as to permit
you return to us. IThe pain you are inflicting ilpon
me it is useless to dwell upon. As the child of my only
and most dearly loed sister, I have loved you, hoped
for you, witl little less iutensity of affeection than that I
ave borne towards my ow; for I felt that, with the
sole exsception of your bother, lI was the only being yo
had on eartl united to you, by ties of blood. IIow this
conduct repays my loe and care you must answer to
yourself; I can ouly be sensible of bitter disappoint-
ment.''
Again she stopped, evidently expecting a reply, but
Ellen still remained silent. The short twiliglht of autumn
had sct in so suddenly, that MIrs. Hamilton was not
aware her niece's cheek had bccome still paler, and that
her white lips quivered repeatedly, as if she seeral
times tried to speak but could not. After a silenee
of some miuutes, she said-

till you leave us, though you will still oceupy your pre-
sent rooms, and be still undcr lEllis's care, you are at
liberty to employ yourself, and go about the house and
grounds as usunl.''
Elloen turned to go, still in tht unbroken silence; shc
had reachced the low step lividing the upper from the
lower part of the room, and whether she did not see it,
or from some other cause, the room suddenly rceeled
before her, and she fell eavily forwards. To spring
towards her, raise her tendely, hear her to the nearest
couch, though she so trembled herself at finding Ellen
quite insensible, as to render the task unusually diffi-
cult, and to ring hastily for llis, was the work of a
minute, but it was many minutes before their united
efforts could bring back consciousness.

ingly, as Ellen feebly raisel her hand to her forehead,
and then slowly unclosed her eyes, nand beheld her aunt
leaning over her, with that same exspression of anxious
affection, which her illness had so often cnused in her
childhood. Sense, or rather memory had ot quite
returned, and her first words were, with a faint but
happy smile-

fully, though meningly, as her look drew her nistrcss's

frame, at the mcntion of her brother.
Pained and bewildered more than ever, MIrs. IInmilton,
anftoer wniting till the faintncss scemed quite gone, and
thinking that if the rcstraint of her presence were re-
moved, Ellen might be reliesed by tcars, left her, de-
siring Ellis to let her know in an short time how she was.

round Ellis's neok, exclaiming passionately-

And almost for the first time since hcr sin had bee
discovered, she gae way to a long and violent fit of
weeping, which, though terrible while it lasted, as the
anguish of the young always is, greatly relieved hcr,
aud euabled her after that day not to revert in words

anxiety deadened it) to her uncle's sentence again.
MIrs. IIamilton sat for a ery long time alone after

eerything rather than betray it? Circurstance after
cireumstance, thought after thought, so congregated

TIIE LIGIIT GILIYIERS.
TnE earnest wishes and payers of Mrs. IIamilton
and her fuaithful Ellis were disappointed. The latter
part of the month of Sentember had been exceedingly
stormy, and though there was a lull from about the
3d to the 9th of October, the equinoctial gales then
set in with the utmost fury;, continuing day aftcr day,
night after night, till the enr scemed almost to tire of
the sound, and the mind, nnxious for friends at sca,
despair of their cessation. During the few cnlm days,
the young party at Oakwood had scarcely been absent
from the windows, or fro that part of the pnrk leading to
the Plymouth road, above an hourat a time. Percy and
Herbert rode over to Plymouth, but were told the frigate
could not be in for a full week. The late storms must
have detained her, though shc was a fast-sailing craft.
It was a great disappointment to thcm, for on the 10th
of October college term begn, and they were compelled
to return to Oxford. The cause of their motler's intense
desire for Edwarl's rcturu, indeed, thcy did not know;
but they were most impatient to see him, and they
hoped, they did not exactly know what, with regard to
his iufluence with Ellen. IIowevcr, the day of their

to be. ull of spirits and jokcs, e determinately looked
away from his cousin, took both Ellis's hands, and shook
themn with his usunl heartiness.
Gool-bye, dear Ellis. I wonder if I shall ever feel
mnyself a man when talking to you. IIow many tricks
I hae played you in tlhis room, and you were always so
good-natured, evcn when one of my seat-craekers set
your best gown on tfire and quite spoiled it, do you
remember it? I do think you were nearly angry then,
and quite enough to make you, and kapa made me sase
up y money to buy you a new dress. I did not play
sich a practical joke in a urry again,''
IEllis lughed and perfectly remembered it, and with
another hearty good-bye he turued away.
You have forgotten your cousin, MIr. Percy,'' sle
said, disregarding Ellen's imploring look.
 When she remembers her duty to my mother, I
will remember that she is my cousin,'' was his hasty
answer, and he hurried from thc room as IIerbert
entered. Ilis good-bye to Ellis was quite as warm as
'ercy's, and then turning to Ellen, he put his arm
round her, lissed ler chcek, and said, with impressive
rCStnCSs-
Gol hless you, dear Ellen? I hope you will be
happier when we meet again, nd that it will not bce so
long before we do, as we faney now;'' and, aflectcd
alost to tecars at the grateful, lunble look she raised
to his, lc left her.

Oercome as much hy the harshness of the geuerous
warm-henrted Percy, whom she so denrly loved, as by
the gentle kindness of IIerbert, Ellen remainel for
several minutes with her arms on the table, hcer face hid
upon them. She thought she was quite alone, for
Ellis had gone about some of hor business, when shc
was startle byg Percy's voice.
I nm a brute, Ellen, nothing less; forgie me, and
say good-bye. I can't understand it at all, hut angy
as I am with yo, your pale face haunts me likc a
spectre, so we must part friends;'' and as she looked
hastily up, he ,kissed her warmly twice, and ran away
without anothcr word.
Days passcd heaily, the gales seeming to increase in
violence, and causing MIrs. Hamilton more tcrrible
anxiety and ague dread than she allowed to be visible.
The damage amongst the shipping was fearful, and the
very supposed vicinity of the frigate to thc Channel
increased the danger. The papers every morning pre-
sented long lists of ships wreeked, or fatally dismantled,
loss of crews or part of them, mails and cargoes duc
but issing: and the vivid recollection of the spposed
fate of her own brother, the wretchedness of thc
suspense, before the fate of his vessel was ascertained,
returned to heighten the fenrs that would gain asceu-
dency for her nephew; and for the effect of this terrible
suspense on Ellen, rore especially,-if indeel she had
endured all these weeks, uay, months of misery for
him.
At first Ellen seemed unconscious that there was

own departure being uppermost ; but wlen the thought
did press upon her, how it came she knew not-that
of the given month te weeks were passing, and Edward
had not arived, and that tere must be some reason for
the long delay-storm, shipwreck, death, all ilashed upon
her at once, and almoast maddened er. The quiet calm
of endurance gave way. She eould not sleep at night
from the tremendous winds; not even when Ellis had
a bel put p in her room, and remained with her all
night herself; she never complained indeel, but hour
after hour she would pace her room and the passage
leading to Ellis's, till compelled to cease from exhaustion,
she would try steadily to employ herself with some
difficult study, and succeed, perhaps, for alf an hour,
bnut then remain powerless, or recommence her restless
walk. MIrs. IInilton made several attempts without
any apparent interference on her part, to get her to sit
oceasionally witl her and MIiss Harcourt, and her
cousins, but she seemed to slrink from them all.
Emmeline iudeed, when once aware of the terrible trial
she was enduring, would sit with her, drawing or work-
ing as if nothing had occurred to estrange them, and
try to cheer her by talking on may topics of interest.
Caroline would speak to her kindly whenever she saw
her. MIiss Ilarcourt alone retainel her indignation,
for no suspicion of thc real cause of her silence ever
entered cr mind.
Poor Ellen felt that she dared not indulge in the

but she only secmed to succecd in loving thcm more.
One thought, indeed, at lcngth took suel entire posscs-
sion of her mind, as to deaden every other;-it wus
the horrible idva that as sle had sined to save Edward,
perhaps from mcrited disgrace, he would be talen from
her; she nevcr brenthed it, but it hauntcd her night
nnd day. MIr. MIaitland saw her continually, but hc
plainly told Mrs. IIamilton, while tlce canse of anxiety
and ental suffering lasted he could do her no good.
It was a constant alternation of fearful excitemcnt and
complete depression, cxhausting the whole system.
Repose and kindness-alasl the Iatter might be gisen,
but the former, in the present position of affairs, how
could it be ensured?
The month of grace was wnning; only two days
remained, and Edward had not arrived, and how could
MIrs. Hamilton obey her husband-whose every lctter
reiterated his hope that she had not been prevailed on
to nlter his sentence, if Ellen still remined silent--and
send her niece fom her? Sle came at legth to tle
determination, tlat if anotber week passcd and still
there were no tidings, not to let this fcarful sclf-sacrifice,
if it really were sueh, last any longer, but geutly,
cautiously, tenterly as she could, prevail on Ellen to
confide all to hor, and promise if Edward rcally had
been erring and in diflicnlties, all should be forgiven
for her sake, and even his uncle's anger aerted. Once
her determination taken, she felt better enabled to

she had fall confidence in Ellis's care.
Ellen was asleep on a sofa, looking so wan, so
haggard-so altered from the Ellen of fie slort months
back, that MIrs. Hamilton sat down by her side, ponder-
ing whether she was doing right to wait even another
wcek, before she should try to bring relief by aowing
her suspicions-but would it bring relief? and after all,
was it for Edward? or, ad she been allowing affection
and imagination to mislead and soften, when sternness
might still be needed ?
Ellen woke with a start as from some fearful dream,
and gazed at MIrs. Hamilton for a full minute, as if she
did not know her.
MIy dear Ellen, what is it? You lave been sleepiug
uncomfortably-surely ou know me ?''
I tlought I was at-at-Seldon Grange-are you
sure I am not? Dear Aunt Emmeline, do tell me I am

in her look and tone.
No, love, you are with me still at Oakwood, and

you away now, Ellen ?''
The soothiag tone, her brother's name, seemed
to dispcrse tle cloud, and, bursting into tears, she
exclaimed-

excitement, she continued--`` Nothing, nothing, indeed,

I do not think you quite know what you are saying,
my dear Ellen; your uncomfortable dream has unsettled
you. Try and keep quiet for an hour, and you will be
better. Remember, suffering as this dreadful suspense
is, your brother is still in a Father's gracious keeping:

Mrs. Hamilton was dreadfully alarmed. Wlat-
ever the foundation, and she had no dobt that
thee was some, and tht it really had to do with
Edward and his poor mother's mistaken partiality,
Ellen's imagination was eidently disordered. To attempt
obtaining the truth, whilc she was in this fenrful state
of exeitement, was as impossible as cruecl, and she tried
only to soothe er to composure; speaking of her
mother, as happy and in IIenven, and that Ellen had
thought of her so much, as was quite natural in her
sorrow, that she fancicd she saw her,

Ellen made no answer; but the alarming exscitement
lad so far subsided, as to raise the hope that quietness
would subdue it altogether. MIrs. IIailton remained
with her, till she seemed quite calm, and would not
have left her then, but sle had promised Caroline to
drie with her into IT- that afternoon to make some
purchases ; Emmeline and Miss Harcourt were spending
the duay at Greville MIanor, and her dauglter depending
on er, she did not like to disappoint her. But the
difficulty to think of other things, and cheerfully con-
erse on comparatively inditlerent topics, was greater
thau she had ever found it. That Ellis' s surise was
corrcct, she lad no longer the smallest doubt. Ellen
was sacrificing herself, not merely for tle lovte she bore
er brother, but from some real or iaginary promise
to hcr poor mother. What its exact nature was, shc
could not indeed satisfy herself, but that it had some-
thing to do with concealing Edward's faults scemed to
ash upon her, she hardly knew how. Ellis's words

`that she had scen enough of that work when they
were children,'' rcturned to her, and arious incongrui-
ties in Ellen's character and conduct, whicl shc had
been unable to reconcile at tle time, sll sccmed con-
ected with it. But to arrive at the truth was much
more difficult than cer; still how could she send Ellen
away  and yet, if still silcnt, would mecre surmise satisfy
her husband? here was but one hope, one ray oflight-
Edward's own honour, if indeed he were permitted to
retur; and een while driving and tnlking with
Cnroline, her hcart was one fervent prayer that this
might be, and tle fearful struggle of her devoted Ellcn
cease.
IIer nunt's gentle and unexpccted kindness hand had
sueh a beneficial effeet on Ellen, that, after her early
dinner, ahout tlree o'clock, she told Ellis she would go
in the schoolroom, and try and read there for an hour;
she knew all the family were out, and therefore would
be quite undisturbed. Ellis willingly acquiesced, re-
joicing that she should scek any change herseclf, and
advised her, as it wnas such a mild soft afternoon after
thc late storms, to take a turu on te terrace, on which
a glass-loor from the scloolroom opcned; it would do
her good. Ellen ment to take her advicce, but as she
lookcd out from the window oer a well-rememhcred
lnndscape, so mauy painful thoughts and recollections
erowded on her, that she lost all inclination to move.
She hadnot stood there for many weels, aud it seemed
to hor that the view had ncvcr looked so very lovely,

humid emerald whicl always follows heavy rain, and
though the sumer-floers hnd all gone, the shcltered
beds of the garden, lying beneathi the terrace, presented
many very beautiful still. The end of the terrace, a flight
of stone steps, overlooked the avenue, leading from the
principal lodge to the main entrance, and where Ellen
stood, she could distinguish a few yards of the path
where it issued from some distant trees. She gazed
at first, conscious only that she was banished from it
all, and that, howeer long her departure might bc
deferred, she must go at last, for her uncle's mandate
could not be disobheyed ; but gradually her eye became
fixed as in fascination. A single figure was emerging
from the trees, and dressed in theuniform of a midship-
man-she was sure it wasl butit was a figure so tall, sa
slim, his step so lingering-it could not be Edwarl,
most likoly somc one of his messmates, come to tell his
fate. He was taller even than Percy, but so much
slighter, so diffcrent to the boy fror whom she had
parted, that, though her heart hounded and sunk till
faintness seemed to overpower hcr, she could not con-
vincc hcrsclf it was he. With an almost unconscious
effort she ran out, through the glass-door, to the steps of
the terace; she could see him now distinctly, but not
lis face, for is cap was low over his forehead; but as
he approached, he paused, as if doubting whether to go
up to the lll-door, or the wcell-kown terrace, by whieh
he had always rushed into the schoolroom, on his daily
return fromn Mr. IIowuard's; and as he looked hastily up,
his cap fell back, and his eyes mct Ellen's. A will but

arms, in tle room she had quitted, his lips repcatetly
pressing her cheek and forchead, and his voice, whicl
sounded so strange-it did not seem like Edward's, it
was so much more deep and manly-entrcating her ta
speak to him, and tell him why she looked so ill; but
still her heart so throbbel she could not speak. She
could only cling close to him and look intently in his
face, which was so altered from the happy, laughing
boy, that had he not been, from his extreme palenecss
and attcnuation of feature, still more like their mother
when she was ill, his sister would scarccly have
known him.
 Dearest Ellen, do speak to me; what has been the

her only a cause of rejoicing;-she hal no idea of the
mingled dread and joy, the trembling, lest Edwnrd had
indeed deceived them all, and, if hc had not, the
redoubled mystery of Ellen's conduct. While he was
absent she could think calmly on him as the cause of all,
but now that he was returned, her heart scemed to turn
sick with apprehension, and shc had hardly strength to
inquire where he was, and great waa her surprise wlen she
fonnd his arrial was still unknown. Cnroline's joyful
exclamation, as she ran into tle scloolroom to put
away some of her purchases, drew her there at once,

calmness.
Yon lo, indced, look as if you wanted English air
and home nursing, my dear boy,'' she said, after some
little time had elapsed, anl Edward had seated hiself
by her, his hand still clasped in hers;  Sr Edward was
quite right to invalid you. kEmmeline does nothing but
talk of rour wounds as making you a complete hero; I
am unromantic enough to wish that you had brought me
home more colour and more flesh, and less glory; but, I
sippose from being so palc, you are more like your poor
mother tan eer;'' and she looked at him so earnestly,
that Edward's eyes, spite of all his efforts, sunk beeath
hers. He answered gaily, howeer, and, in reply to
Caroline's numerous queries, entered into an animated
description of their oyage home and the causes of their
detention, in their bcing so often compelled to put into
port from the fearful storms they ad eneountered, and
time slipped awar so fast that the dinner-bell rung
before any one was prepared.
That Ellen should look paler than even when she had
loft her in the morning, and be still more silent, did not
astonish Mrs. Hamilton; the agitation of meeting her
hrotler was quite enough to occasion it; and she
advised her to remain quiet while they were at dinner,
that she might rcjoin them afterwards. She looked
as if she land heen so very lately ill, that Edward was
not surprised at hor haing dined already; but many

quietness while alone, and her rother's words rung i
her cars, till rcpose seemcd farther off than eer. After
nll she had suffered before, and after the sendiug that
fatal letter, it lad never reaclcd him: she had utterly
failed iu her attempt to save him. If she had, indeed,
confided at first in MIrs. IIamilton, measures would have
been taken, she was sure, to ave secured him the
necessary relief, for whenever her uncle had sent him
his allowance it was through Sir Edward, not encoun-
tering the risk of the loss of a letter. Thore had been
timcs wen, in the midst of her snfferings, Ellen conld
realize a sort of comfort in the idea that she hnd saved
Edward and kept his secret; but where was this com-
fort now7 All she had endured, all shce was still to
endure, was for nothing, worse than nothing; for if
dward knew her sin, feeling that it had brought
him no good, and given up, as she felt he must be,
to unrestrained passion, or he conld not have given
vent to such fearful seutiments, she aetually trembled
for its effeet upon him nd his anger on lerself.
She had sometimes fancied that, pcrhaps, his errors
were not so great as he believed them, that he
would confess them when he fond only his kind
indulgent aunt at home, and so peace and hope
gradually dawu for both him and ler. All hor wish,

its cause or not, its effect on im would be so terrible,
thnt she felt any additional sufering to herself could
be hetter borne.
With these thoughts, no wonder she was silent, utterly
unable to subdue them as she wished, and evince natural
interest in all that had oecurrel to Edward; and tell him
all that had happened to herself during thcir long sepa-
ration. Carolinc, however, was so animated; and when
Emmeline and Miss Harcourt rcturned, unable to com-
prehend what they could possibly be sent for, a full
hour earlier than usual, their astonishment and delight
at seeing Edward, prevented anything like a pause in
conversation, or unnatural restraint. His cousins found
so much to tell as well as to listen to, about Percy and
IIerbert, as well as themselves; and Emmeline made
Edward tell her such minute particulars of their engage-
ments with the pirates, and how he was wounded, and
what Sir Edward said to him, that MIrs. Hailton,
anxious as she was-for the longer she wuas ith het
nephew, the more convinced she was that he could not
mect her eye, and that lis gaiety was not natural-she
could not help being nmused in spite of herself.
Engrossed with thought how to arrive at the truth,
for which she so ardently longed, she cntered the
library, when the pryer-bell rung, witl her children ;
quite forgetting, till she had taken the place at the
reading-desk, which, in the alsence of her husband
and sous, she always occupied herself, that she had

it vexocd her excecdingly. She lookcd hastily round, in
the hope of bcing in timc, hut Ellen was already in her

the recess of the lower window, as if longing for its

grieved if she had sccn, as Ellis did, the beseeching
humble look, which as they entered Ellcn had fixed
npon her, and that hcr pale lips had quivered with the
half-uttered supplication, which she failel in courage
fully to pronounce. Edward appeared too wrapt in his
own thoughts to notice it thcn; and as his aunt's
gentlc but impressive voice fell on his ear, the words,
the room, thc whole scene so recalled the happy, and
comparativcly innocent past, that it was with difficulty he
could restrain his fcelings, till the attitude of kneeling
permitted them full ent in tears, actual tears, when he
had thought hc could never weep again. The contast
of his past and prescnt self, rendered the one more
brightly happy, the othcr more intensely dark than tle

his early childhooi had been the sole cause of his pre-

he arose, and became aware, for the first time, thut
Ellen was not where he was accustomed to see her. He

night to the rest of the family, and no embrace, as

 Not to-night, my denr Edward. It is a long tale
and a painful one, and I rely on you to help me, that
Ellen and myself may be again as we hae been. It is
as much pain to me as to her that we are not. To.

had excitement enough for to-day, and after your ex-
hausting voyage must need rest. Do not fancy this an
evasion of your request; I have longed for your return

of seeing you again.''
Edward was compelled to be satisfed and retire; but

comfort of his room to be unusually luxurious, his sleep
was restless and disturbed by frightful dreams, in wlicl,

On retiring for the niglt, Mrs. IIamilton discoverel
a ote on her dressing-table. She thought she knew
the writing, but from tremulousness it was so ncarly
illegible, that it was with great difficulty she lecipherel
the following words:
I am so conscious I ought not to address you,
know so well that I have no right to ask any favour from
you, wen I have gien you so much trouble and pain,
that I could not have asked it, if you had not been sa
very, very kind this morning. Ohl Aunt Emmeline,

from Oakwood; tell lim I have been very wickel-
have refused to eince any real repentance-but do not
tell im what I have done. He is ill, unhappy at
having to resign his profession even for a few months.
Oh l spare him the misery of knowing my sin. I know
I deserve nothing but severity from you-I lae no
right to ask this-but, ohl if you have ever loved
me, do not refuse it. If you would but grant it, would
but say, before I go, that in time you ill forgie mc,
it would be such comfort to the miserable-ELLEN,''
Mrs. Hamilton's eyes filled with tears; the word
`you'' had evidently been written originally, but par-
tially erased, and  the'' substituted in its stead, and she
could not rcad the utter desolation of one so youhg,
which that simple incident betrayed, without increase
of pain; yet to grant her request was impossible. It

know it:' uuless, indeed,-and her heart bounded with the
hope-tlat she fceared it would urge him to confess lim-
self the cnuse, and her sacrifice be useless. She locked up
the note, which she would not read again, fearing its deep
 humility, its cnrnest supplication, wold turn her from
her purpose, and in praying fervently for guidance and
ftful sleep ler night passed.
For somc time after brenkfast the following morning,
Elward and his aunt were alone togcther in the lilrary.
It was with the utmost difficulty, he suppressed, suffi-
ciently to concenl, the fenrful agitntion which thrilled
through every nerve as he listened to the tale e ad
lemauded. He could not doubt the use to which that
money hal been applicel. His sister's silence alone
would have confirmed it; but in that hour of madness,
--for what elsc is passion unrestrained by principle or
feeling -he was onl conscious of anger, fierce anger
against the unhappy girl who had borne so much for
him. IIe had utterly forgotten the desperate words he
had writtcn. IIe ad neer receied the intended relief.
ITiIl within a week, a short week of his return, he had
been in Harding's power, and as Ellen's dorotion had
saved hin nothiug, what could t wcigh against the
maddening conviction, that if he bad one spark of
honour remaining, he st confess that e had caused
her sin? lnstead of saving, shc had betrayed him; uand
le left his atnt to scek Ellen, so evidently listurbed and
heated, and the interview itself had been so little satis-
faetory in softening him, as, she had hopel, to win
him to confession at onee, for she lad purposely spoken

as idulgently of error and diffieulty as she could, with-
out betraying her strengthcned snspicions, thmat if she
had known how to do so, she would have forbidden his
seeing Ellen till e was more calm.
Unhappily, too, it was that part of the day when Ellis
was always most engged, and she was not even in hcr
own room, so that there was no check on lEdwnrd's
violence. The control he lad cexcrcised while with his
nunt but inecrcased passion when it was rcmoved. IIe
poured forth the bittercst rcproachcs-asked how she
could dare hope relioef so obtaiuel, would ever hre been
allowed to reach him?-what had she done but betrayed
him? for how could le be such an dishonoured coward
as to let ler leave Oakwood becnusc she would not
speak' and why had sle not spoken-why not be-
tsnycd him at once, and not decoyed him homc to
lisgrace and misery? Passion had so maddened him,
that hc neither knew what he snid himself, nor henrd
her imploring entreaties not to betray himsolf, and she
eer would. She chng to his kuces ns she knelt be-
fore him, for she was too powerless to stand, reiterating
her supplication in a tone that ought to have recalled
him to his better self, but tht better self hnd bccn too
long silenced, and infuriated at her convulsie cfforts to
letaiu him, hc struck her with snftficient force to makc
her, more by the agony of a blow from him, than thc
pain itself, loose her hold at once, and darted from the

arrired nt one particular spot he knew not, for it was
one which of all others, in that moment of cxcite-
mcnt, he wonld gladly hae aoided. It was a
small glnde in the midst of the wood shelving down
to the water's edge, where he and Perey, with the
assistance of Robert, had ecn permitted to erect. a
miniature boat-house, and wlhere Edward had kept a
complete ilotilla of tiny sessels. There were the trees,
the gladc, the hont-house still, ay, and the vessels, in such
heautiful repair and keeping, that it brought back the
past so vividly, so oerpoweringl, from the voiceless
proof, which it was, of the affeetionate rcmembrance with
which hc and his faorite tastes had been regarded,
een in his absence, that he could not bear it. Ie flung
himself full leugth on the greensward, and as thought
after thought came back upon him, bringing Ellen
before him, self-sacrificing, devoted, always interposing
between him and anger, as she had done fromn the frst
hour thcy had becn inmates of Onkwood, the thought
of that craen blow, those mad reproaches was in-
supportable; aud he sobbed for nearly an hour in that
one spot, longing that some chance would but bring
MIr. IIoward to lm, that he might relieve that fearfnl
remorse at once, but utterly unable to seck him of
himself.
Elward's disposition, like his mother's, was naturall
mnch too good for the determined pursuit of evil. IIis
errors had actually been much less grave, than from
Harding' s artful representations he imagined them. IIe

ciously banished the religion which his aunt had so
triel to instil, and heen taught by IIarding to scoff at
the only safe guide for youth, as for every age, Gol's
holy word, he had nothing whercon to lean, cither as a
comfort in his remorse, a hopc for amendmcnt, or
strength for self-conquest; and terrible indeed might
have been the consequenccs of IIarding's fatal influenee,
if the influence of a home of love had not been still
stronger.
Two hours after he had quitted his aunt, he rejoined
the family, tranquil, but bearing such evident traees of
a mental struggle, at least so Mrs. Iamilton fancied,
for no one olse noticel it, tbat she still hoped she did
not exactly know what, for she failed in courage to ask
the issue of his intervicw witl Ellen. She contcnted
herself with desiring Emmeline to tell her cousin to
bring her work or drawing, and join them, and she was
so surprised, when Emmeline brought back word that
Ellen had said sle had much rather not, that she sought
her herself.
Ellen's cheeks, in geneal so pale, were crimson, her
eyes in consequence nnaturally brilliant, and she looked
altogether so unlike hersoelf, tht her aunt was more
anxious than ever; nor did her manner when asked why
she refuiscd to join them, when Edward hd so lately
returned, tend to decrease the feeling.
 Emmeline did not say you desired it, or I should
have known better than to disobey,'' wns her reply, and
it was scarcely lisrespectful; the tone seemel that ofa
spirit, crushel and goadel to the utmost, and so uttcrly
nable to contend morce, tlough cery nere was quiver-

ing with pain. MIrs. IIamilton felt bitter pain that
Ellen at length did indeed shrink from her; that the
disregard of her entreaty concerning her brother
appeared so to have wounded, that it had shaken the
aftection which no other suffering had had power to
moc.
I o not desire it, Ellen, though I wish it,'' she
replied, mildly; ` you are of course at liberty to act as
you please, though I should hae thought it most
natural that, not haing been with Edward so long,
you should wish to be with him as much as possible
ow he is at home.''
 IIe will not wish it; he hates me, spurns me, as I
knew he would, if he knew my sinl To-day I was to
hae gone to eldon Grange; let me go at oncel then
neither he, nor you, nor any one need be tormented
with me any more, and you will all be happy again; let

If you wish it, Ellen, ou shall go next week. I
did not imagine that under any circumstances, you
could have expressed a desire to leae me, or suppose
that it would make me particularly happy to send you
away.''
 Why should it notl you mnst hate me, too, or-or
you would not hase refused the only-only favour I
asked you before I went,'' answered poor Ellen, and the
oice, which had been unnaturally clear, was choked
for the moment with sobs, which she resolutely forced
back. Mrs. Hamilton could scarcely hear it; taking
her ice-cold hands in both hers, she said, almost
tenderly-
168
IIoME INFILULNCE.
You ave reason to condem me as harsh and cruel,
Ellen ; but time will perhaps explain the motives of my
conduet, as I trust and pray it will solve the mystery
of yours; you arc not well enough to be left long alone,
and Ellis is so much engaged to-day that I do wish you
to be with me independcnt of your brother's society.
If you so much prefer remaining here, I will stay with
you, though of course, as Elward has been away from
us so long, I should wish to be with him also.''
It was almost the first time MIrs. IIumilton had ever
had recourse in the managemcnt of her family to any-
thing that was not perfectly straightforward; and
though her present motivcs would have hallowed much
deeper stratagems, her pure mind shrunk from her ow
words. She wished Ellen to be constantly in Edward's
presence, thnt he might not bhe able to oevade the impulse
of feeling and honour, which the sight of such suffering,
she thought must call forth; she could not benr to
enforce this wish as a command, when she had already
been, as she felt-if Ellen's silence were indeed self-devo-
tion, not guilt-so cruelly and so necessarily sevcre.
Ellen made neither reply nor resistance, but, taking up
her work, accompanied er ant to the usual morning-
room, from which many a burst of happy laughter, and
joyous tones were echoing. Caroline and Emmcline
were so full of enjoyment at Eward's return, had sa
many things to ask and tell, were so perfectly unsuspi-
cious as to his having any concern with his sister's fult,
thnt if they did once or twice think him less lively and
joyous, than when he loft home, they attributed it
simply, to his not having yet recovered the exshausting

oyage and his wonnds. Miss Harcourt, just as un-
suspicious, secretly accused lEllen ns the cause of his
occasional abstraction: her conduct was not likely to
pass unfelt by oue so upright, so honorable, and if he
hmd been harsh with her, as from Lllen's fenrfully
srinking manner, and complete silence wlen they were
together, she fancied, she thought it was so deserved,
that she hd no pity for hcr whatever.
The day passed briskly and happily enough, in seeming
to MIrs. llamilton aud Ldward, in reality to all the other
mcbers of the party-but one. The great subject of
regret was MIr. IIownrd's absence, he might be bnck nt
the Rectory that eveniug, and Eceliue was sure he
would comc to see Edward diectly. As the hours
waned, Ellen became seusible of a sharp and most un-
nsual pain darting through hcr temples, and gradually
extending over her foroehead and head, till she could
scarccly move her cyes. It lad come at first so suddenly,
and lasting so short a time, that she could scarcely
define what it was, or why she shonld hare felt so
suddenly sick and faint; but it increased, till there was
no difficulty in tracing it, and before praycr-time, had
hecome such fearful agony, that, if she had not been
inured to paiu of all kinds, and endowed with extra-
ordinnry fortitude and control, she must more than once
have betrayed it, by cithcr giving way to faintness, or
screaming aloud. She had overheard Irs. Hamilton
desire IRohert, to request Mr, ailand to come to Oak-
wood as soon as he could, and not hcaring the rcply
that he was not exspected home till late atnight, cs-

pectel him every moment, and thought he would gie
her something to relieve it, witlout her complaining.
IEward had asked his cousins for some music, and
tlen, to plcease Emmeline, hnd sketched the order of
their cngagement with the pirates, and o one noticed
her, for Mlrs. lnmilton's heart was sinking with dis-
appointed hope, as the hours passcd, and there was no
sigu to prove tht her surmise was correct, and if it
were, that the truth would be obtainel.
The prayer-bcll rug, and as they rose, Edward's eyes,
for thie first time since she had joined them, sought and
fixed tlemselves on his sister's face. Te paroxysm of
pain had for a few minutes subsided, as it had done
nlternately with violence all dny, but it ad loft her sa
ghastly pale, that hc started in actual terror. It might
hnve bcen fancy, but e thought there was the trace of
his cowardly blow on her ple forehead, raised, and
black, and such a fecling of agony anl remorse rushed
over him, that it was with difficulty he restrained him-
self from catching her in his arms, and besceehing her
forgiveness before them all; but there was no time
then, and they proeceded to the library. Every step
Ellen took appeared to bring back that fenrful pnin,
till as she snt down, and then knelt in her place, sle
was sensible of nothing else.
The service was over; and as MIrs. Hnmilton rose
from the private prayer, with wliech each individual

white as marble, but with an expession of fixed resolu-
tion, which made her heart bound up with hope, at thc

ery oment it turned sick and faint with terror.
Seeral of the. lower domestics had quitted the library
before Edward regained oice, and his first word, or
rather action, was to desire tlose that remnined to stay.
 MIr sister has been disgraced, exposed before you
all,'' he exclaimed, in a tone of misery and determina-
tion, that so startled MIiss lIarcourt nand lis cousins,
they gazed at him bewillerel, `and before you all
must be her esculpation. It was less for her sin than ler
silence, and for the increased guilt whiel tlat appecared
to conceal, you tell me, she has been so sevrerely trceated.

For a full minute after these unexpected, startling
wrords there wans silence, for none could speak, not even
Emmeline, whose first thonght was only joy, that
Ellen's silence was not so guilty as it seemed. Edward
had crossed his arms on the reading-desk, and buried
his face upon them. The instantaneous change of senti-
ment whichl his confession excited towards Ellen in
those most prcjudiced can senrcely be deseribed ; but

Ellen unclasped her hnds from her forehead, and
looked up in MIrs. Hamilton's face. Her lips mioved as

Ir was indeed a fearful niglt wicl followed the close
of our last chapter. Illness, sufficient to occasion
anxiet, both in Herbert and Ellen, had been often an
inmate of Oakwood, but it had merel called for care,
and all those kindly smpathies, whieh render indisposi-
tion sometimes an actual blessing, both to those who
sufler and those who tenl. But illness, appearing to
be but the ghastly ehicle of death, clothed in such fear-
ful pain, that no control, een of reason and strong will,
can check its agonized exspression, till at last, reason
itself succbs beneath it, and bears the mind from the
tortured frame, this is a trial of no ordinary suffering,
een hen such illness has een bronght about b what
may be termed natural causes. But vhen it follows, nay,
springs from rental anguish, when the sad watchers
feel that it might lavse been arerted, that it is the con-
sequence of mistaken treatment, and it cores to the
young, to whom such sorrow ought to be a thiug un-

stood by Ellen's bed, watching the alternations of dcath-

fession bringing hope and rest to anll; that the aching
hcnd and strnined nerves of her poor Ellen, only neceded
rcturning love, and the quictness of assured forgiveuess
for herseclf and Edward, for health and happiness gradu-
ally to return; and the shock of such sudden and terrible
illncss, betraying, as it did, an extent of previous mental
suffering, whicl she hnd not conceived as possible in
one so young, almost unnerved her. But hers was not
a character to give way; the anguish she experienced
might be rend in the almost steru quict of er face, in

comfort, without a word fro hcer, her husband, was
far away, and she dared not sink; though there were
times when heart and frame felt so utterly exhausted, it
seemed as if she rust.
MIr. IIoward's presence al been an inexpressible re-
lief. Go to Edward, my lenr friend,'' she had snid,
as le lingered beside the hed where Ellen had been lail,
longing to comfort, but feeling at such a moment it was
impossible; `e wants you more than any oue else;
win himto confide in you, soothe, comfort him; do not
let lim be out of your sight.''
Not unlerstanding her, except that Elward must be
naturally grieved at his sister's illness, MIr. IIoard
sought him, and found lim still in the library, almost
 in the same spot.
This is a sad welcome for ou, Edward,'' he said,
kindly laying his hand on his shoulder, "`but do not be

its full conlidenceaud soothe at the same time. lEdward
ponred out his whole tale. It is needless to enter upon
it hcre in detail; suflice it, that the artful inllucnce of
IIarding, by gradually undermining the gool imprcs-
sions of the home he had left, had prepared his pupil for an
unlimited indulgencce in pleasure, and excitement,at eery
opportunity whicl offered. And as thc lPrince William

knew when to bring wine to the billiard-table, so to creatc
such a delirium of excitement, tlat Edward was wholly
unconscious of his owu actions; and once or twicc, he
led him iuto scenes, and made him sharcr of such
icious plcasures, that secured him as his slave; for when
the excitemcent was oer, the agony of remorse, the
misery, lest his confiding captain shounld suspect him
other than e seemed, made him cling to IInrding's
promises of seerecy, as his only refuge, ven while he
loathed the mnn hiself. It was easy to make such a
disposition believe that he had, in some moment of ex-
citement, done somcthing which, if known, wouldecpel
hin the Nny; Edward could never recall what, but he
beliesrel him, and became desperate. Harding told lim
it was downright folly to think about it so seriously. It
was onls known to hin, and he would not betray him.
But Edward writhed beneath his power; perpetually he
called on him for pecuniary help, and when he had
none, told him he must write home for it, or win it at
the billiard-table, or he knew the consequences; and
Elward, though again and again he had rcesolved he
would not touch a ball or cuc, (and the reorse had
been such, that he would no doubt have kept thc
rcsole, had it not bcen for dread of betrayal,) ruther
tlan write home, would madly seek thce first opportunity,
and play, and win perhaps cnough, all butn few pounds,
to satisfy his tormentor, and for these he would appeal
to his sister, and receive thcm as we know; uever ask

The seven or eight monthis which had clapsed before
his last fatal nppeal, had been oeeasioned by the ship
being out at sea. Sir Edward had mentioned to Mr.
IIanilton, that Edward's excellent conduct on board

were off New York, to which place he lad been de-
spatched on business to the Prcsident, than most of his

a chance at billinrds for it; but if that failed, he must
pump his ricl relations for it, for have it he must.
Tusting to his luck, for he had often won, even with
Harding, he rushed to the table, played, and as might
be cxpected, left off, owing his tormentor fifty pounds.
Harding's fiendish triumph, and his deelaration that he
must trouble him for a cheque to that amount, signcd
by the great millionuaire, Arthur Hnruilton, Esq., goaded
him to madness. He drank down a large draught of

Harding taught him to suppose them; and the anguis

comfort; and he himself, though he would not ald
to Edward's misery by confessing it, felt more pain-
fully self-reproachel for his severity towards her, than
his conduct as aminister had ever excited before.

There was much in the snd tale he had hcnard to gie
hope, and Mr. IIoward longed to impart its comfort to
MIrs. Hamilton; but le felt shc could not listen. While
day after day passed, and te poor sufferer for another's
erros lay hoering between lifc and death, reason s
utterly suspended, that even whcn the violent agony of
the first seven days and nights had subsidel into
lethargic stupors, alternating with such quiet submission
and gentle words, that, had it not been for their wander-
ing sense, one might have fancied intellect returning:
still reason was absent-and, thougl none said it aloud,
the fenr would gain dominion that health might returu
but not the mind. Tle first adice had been procured;-
what was distance, een then, to wealth-every remed
resorted to. Her luxuriant hair cut close, and ice itself
applied to cool tlat burning tlrobbing pain; but all
had seemed ain, till its cessation, at the end of seven
days, somewhat renewed Mr, MIaitland's hope.
Not one tear had MIrs. Hamilton shed, and so exces-
sive hadl been her fatigue, that Miss Harcourt and her
children trembled for her; conjuring her, for their
sakes, for her husband's, to take repose. MIr. Initland's

And she did derote herself to Edward, and so success-

tendoer fceling towards his faults, her conviction of ler

looked to ler society, her eloquence, as comfort nnd
hope; and soon perceiving this, she was encouraged to
go on, though quite astonished-for she could not
imagine what she had done to deserve such commenda-
tion-when MIr. Howard, one day meetig her alone,
took both her hands in his, and with even unusual
ferrour bade God bless her-for young, lowly, as she

in displeasure.
Ton or twelve days had so passed, whcn one after-
noon, completely exhnausted itl two niglts' wntchful-
ness-for though Nurse ILangford and Fanny wcre in
constant attendance on Ellen, she could not rest if she
heard that harrowing cry for her, even thongl her pre-
sence brought no comfort,-she wct to lie down
for a few hours on a couch in her dressing-room.
Cnroline had taken a book, though with not muc in-
lination to read, to sit by her, and watch that her
sleep should not be disturbed. How, in those moments
of quiet did she long for her fatherl feeling intuitively
how much heavier was her mother's trial without his
loed support. He ad been written to by thcm all
since Edward's confession. MIrs. llamilton had done
so in Ellen's room, only to beseech him to write for-
givingly, forbearingly, to the unhappy cause of all. Shc
did not dare breathe her feelings, even on paper, to him,
convinced that if she did so, control must give way, and
she was powerless at once; but her husband knew henr
so well, that every suppression of indiidual emotion
betrayed more forcibly than the most earuest words, all
she was enduring.

hours, when Edward's oice whispered,  MIiss IIarceourt

stool to the foot of thc couch, as if not daring to oceupy
his cousin's scat, which was close by the pillow, gazed
on the mild gentle features of his aunt, as in their deep
repose they showed still clearor the traces of anxiety and
sorrow, and felt more keculy than ever the full amount
of misery, which his errors and tleir fatal concealment
had creatcd.  Wy is it,'' he thought, ` that man
cannot bear the punishment of his faults without causing
the innocent, the good, to suffer also?'' And is heart
seemed to answer, ` Because by those ery social ties, the
strong impulscs of lovo for one another, which would
save others from woe, we may be preserved and
redeemed from vice again and yet again, when, were
man alone the sufferer, vice would he stronger than
remorse, and neer be redeemed,''
Mrs. IIamilton woke with that painful start which long
watchfulness always occasions, and missing Caroline,
yet feeling as if she were not alone, her eyes speedily
tixod thcmseles in somc surprise on the figure of her
nephew, who, unable to bear tle thoughts the sight of
her exhustion produced, hnd bent his head upon the

tunity to speak to him alone, she cnlled him to lher, and
there was something in the tone that encouraged him to
iling himself on his knees by her side, and sob like an
infant, saying, almost inarticulately-

Do ou know anything of the promise to which poor

had become inmates of Oakwood Ellen lad constantly
saved him from puishment by bearing the penalty of
his faults; recalling numerous incidents, trifling in
themselses, but which had always perplexed Mrs.
Ilamilton, as evincing such strange contradictions in
Ellen's childish character, and none more so than the
disobedience which e related in our second part,
and whicl Elward's aowal of having himslf moved
the flower-stad, now so clearly explained. He said,
too, tlt MIr. Iowrd had thought it necessary, for
Ellen's perfect justification, to examine her letters and
paers, hut that all his appeals to her had been destroyed
but one-his last fatal inclosure, the exact contents of
which e had so utterly forgotten, written, as they were
in a moment of madness, that he slddered himself as
he read it. He placed the paper in MIrs. Hamilton's
hand, conjuring her not to recall her forgiveness when
she rcnd it; but she must see it, it was the only amends
he could make his poor llen, to exculpate her fully.
Wns it any wonder it had almost drien her wild? or
that she should have scarcely known the means she
adopted to send him the relief, wich, as le deserved,
had never reached him?

ing lLllen's conduct from her fifteenth birthday, the day
she received it, to the discovcry of hcr sin, and her
devoted silence afterwards, trilling incidents which she
had forgotten rcturned to adl thcir weight of evidence,
and increase almost to agony her self-reproach, for not
secing the whole hefore, and acting ifferently. She
reembered now Ellen's procrastination in writing to
Edward, the illness wvhicl followed, and could well
understand her dread lest the finding the notes slould
be traced to that day, and so throw a suspicion on ler
brother, and her consequent firmness in refusing to state
tle day she hal found them.
Thiat long interview was one of inexpressible comfort
to Edward; but though his unfeigned repentanee and
full confession gave his aunt hope for him, it did but
increase her indiidual trial, as she returned to Ellen's
couch and listencd to wanderings only too painfully ex-
plained by the tale she had heard.

Ir was the seenteentl duy of Ellen's illness, and for
sixs and thirty houurs she had slept profoundly, waking
only at very long intervals, just sufficiently to swallow
a few adrops of port wine, which Mr. MInitlnnd had
ordered to be administeved if she woke, and sunk
to sleep again. It was that deep, still, almost fearful

what were lEdward's and MIrs. IIamilton's? The former
was kneeling on the right of the bed, his eyes alter-
ately fixed on his sister, and uried in the coer-
lid. MIrs. lIamilton was on the opposite sidc, close to
Ellen's pillow, the curtain draw so far back, that the
least chaugc on her patient's countcnanee was discern-
ible. IIour after hour had so passed, the climes that
told their flight scearcely leard by those anxious wntchers.
It was about cight o'clock, when a slight movement in
Ellen made her aunt's heart so throb, as almost to
deprive her of breath; her eyes unclosed, aud a smile,
such as Mrs. IIamilton had not seen for weeks, nay
months, circled ler lips.
 Duar Aunt, have l been ill? It seems such a long, long
time siuce l hae seen you, and my head feels so strange,

trembled with the change from sicleuing dread to cer-
tain hope, thut she lerself scarcely knew how she spoke
at all.
 But what made mc so ill, Annt? I feel as if it wcre

Ellen looked lauguidly, yet eagerly round, as her
aunt spoke, and her gaze fixed itself on her brother, who
was struggliug violently to suppress the emotion, which
at the sound of her oice, in connected words, nearl
overpowerel him; and still more so,- when Ellen said,

of thought, that MIrs. lamilton became alarmcd. She
saw too that Edward was growing paler nnd paler,
and trembled for the continuance of his control. Taking
Ellen's hand gently from his, and arranging her pillow
at te same timc, so as to turn er face rather from him,
she sid, playfully-
 You have looked at Edwrd long enough, Ellen, to
be quite sure he is safe at home. So now I shall be
jealous if you gise him any more of your attention and
eglcct mc; yo must take some nourislment, and try
to go to sleep again, for I must not have you try your
strength too much.''
If I could but remember clenrly,'' answered Ellen,
sudly; ' it is all so vague-so dark-but I lo not think
it was only because e did not come, that made me so
unhappy.''
 You are not going to be disobedient, dearest,''
replied Mrs. Iamilton, firmly, though fonddy, as she
astily signed to ldward to lenvse the room, wlich he
most tlnkfully did, never stopping till he renelcd his
own, and tried to thank God fo IIis great mercy, but
could only sob. :I told you not to think, becuse to
do so might retard return of strength, and indecd yo
must try and oheyme; you know Iam very peremtory
sometimes,'' And the fond kiss with wlich she enforeed
the command seemcd to satisfy Ellen, whose natural

submissiveness, combined with excessie physical wenk-
ness, caused her to obey at once, and not attempt to think
any more. She took the required nourishment with
returninug appetite, and soon afterwards fell quietly and
nppily to sleep again, her aunt's hand closely clasped
. in hers.
From that day, all fear of disordered intellect de-
parted, and gradually the extreme exhaustion gave way
before MIr. MIaitland's judicious treatment. Strength,
indced, returned so slowly and almost imperceptibly,
that it was necessary to count improvement by weeks,
not days. And when, si weeks after her first seizure,
she was thought well cnough to be cnrried to MIrs.
HImilton's dressing-room, and laid on a couch there,
it was a source of gratitude and rejoicing to all. But
MIr. MIaitland and MIrs. Iamilton soon saw, and with
intense anxiety, tlat with the physical strength memory
and thought had bot fully returned, and that tleir
consequence was a depression so dcep, as effectually
to retard her perfect recoery. She seemed to shrink
from all attention, all kindness, as utterly unleserved,
even from er cousins. She would look at Edward
for half an hour together, with an expression of suf-
fering, that made the heart actually ache. At times
she would receite MIrs. IIamilton's caressing and judi-
cious tenderness as if it were her only comfort, at
others, shrink from it, as if she had no right to it.
Tlis will never do,'' M. Maitland said, about ten
days after Ellen's removal into her daily quarters, and
finding she was losig ground; `` there is something
on her mind, whicli must be remoed, even if to do

clearly I fenr, so our not alluding to it does no good.
You must be the pbysician in this case, my dear MIrs.
Hamilton, for I am powerless.''
But though she quite agreed with him, how to
appronch such a vcry painful subject required no little
consideration, but, as is very oftcn the cnse, chance does
that on which we have expended so much thought.
One afternoon Ellen lay so still, so pale, on her
couch, that MIrs. IlIamilton bent over her to listen if she
breathed, saying, as she did so, almost unconsciously-
 My poor Ellen, when shall I hase tle comfort of
seeing you well and happy again 2''
Ellen hastily unclosed her eyes, for she was not asleep,
-it had been only the stupor of painfully-cngrossing
thought, rendering her insensible to all outward things,
but her aunt's voice aroused her, and it seemed an in-
expressible relief to feel they were quite alone. Trying
to rise, and clasping her hands, she said, in a tone of
strong excitement-
Oh, Aunt Emmeline, how can I be happy-how
can I be well-when I think-think-that if it had not
been for my sin, and the misery it brought me, Edward
might be snfe still? no one need have known his erroras.
I tried to save,-and-and I have ouly betrayed, and
made him wretched. All I suffered was for nothing,
worse than nothing l''

painful mists, that are still pressing so heavily on this
poor little heart and brain,'' she said, fondly, though
seriously, as she put her arm round Ellen, to support
her as sle sat up.I o nottell you it is not a natural
feeling, my love, but it is a wrong one. Iad yous
 sin, in consideration of its bcing, as I am now con-
vinced it was, wholly inoluntary-for in the fearful
state of mind Edward's desperate letter occasioned,
you could not have known or thought of anything,
but that relief seemed sent to our hand-had it
on that account been permitted so far to succeed, as
to give him the aid he demanded, and never have been
traced to you, it would hase confirmed im in the
path of guilt and error, and poisoned your happiness
for ever, Wuen you recall the agony, almost madness
you felt, while burdened with the consciousness of
such an act, how could yo hae borne it, if it had con-
tinued through months, perhaps years? You shudder;
yet this must hae been the case, and Edward would
have persisted in error, if your sin had been per-
mitted to succeel. Its detection, and the suntlerings
thence springing, terrible as they have been to you, my
poor child, have saved him; and will, I trust, only
bring securer happiness to you,''
`Saved himl'' repeated Ellen, half starting up,
and scarcely hearing the last words-'saved Elwardl''
 Yes, dearest, by leadiug him to a full confession,
and giving him not only the incxpressible cofort of
such a proceeding, but permitting him tosee, that great

It is a hard lcsson to learn, and yet, Ellen, I think one
day, when you can look back more calmly on thc last
few months, you will ncknowledge with me, that great

to him and to you.''
If they have snved him-saved him from a conti-
ance in error, and so made him happy-Oh, Aunt
Emmeline, I can think so now, and I will try to hear

to be of no more account to me, than it seemed to you
Come, smile, dearest; I promise you, in your uncle's
name and my own, you shall neer leave mne, unless it
be your own free will and pleasure a few years hcnee.''
Ellen did try to smile, but she was too weake to bear
this complcte remoal of a double burden witout an
emotion that seemed more like pain than joy. She
Iaid her head on her aunt's shoulder, and wept without
restraint. They were the first tears she hnd shed since
her illness, and Mrs. IIamilton tlanked God for them.
She did not attempt to check them, but the few words
she did speak told such affectionate sympathy, such
perfect comprehension of that young heart, that Ellen
felt as if a mountain of lend were dissolving from her.
'And now, my Ellen, that I have relieved you of a
painful dread, will you case my mind of a great
nnxiety ?'' inquired Mrs. Hamilton, nenrly an hour after-
wards, when Ellen scemcd so relieved and caled, that she
could talk to her without fcnr. `' You look surprised;

A leep flush rose to Ellen's transparent chcek and
brow, as sle answerel, faltcringly-
Ought I to tcll you, dcar Aunt? You do not know

conscious face.
 WVrong in youl no, dearest; for you were too young
to know all the pain and evil it was likely to bring.
Tell me, when and how it was taken; and I think I can
prove to you that your poor mother would have re-

Thus cneouraged, Ellen narratcd the scene that had
talen place in Widow Morgan's cottage just before
Mrs. Hamilton arrived; and her mother's fears for
Edward, and dread of MIr. Hamilton, which it was very
evident, and now more than ever, had extended to both

Oakwood before it made hcr very unhappy, from its con-
stant interference with, and prevention of, her ohedience
and duty to her aunt; that it had often caused hcr violent
headaches, only from her vain attempts to satisfy herself
as to that which she ought to do. Wuen Edward first
 ent to sea, and all seemed so right and lappy with
him, of course she became happier than she had ever
been before. Then came his difficulties, and her con-
yiction that she must save him and keep his secret.
That her reason and her affection often urged her to con-
fide all to her aunt, certain that she would not harshly
condemn Edward, but wonld forgive, and elp him far
more effectually than she could; but sle dared not, for
wheneser she thought thus the figure of her mother
rose before her, seeming to reproach and threaten her
for exposing the child she so dearl loed to disgrace
and ruin; and this was so viid-so constant-during
his last appeal, that she thought she must be going
mad; that nothing but the dread of not bheing firm
enough to keep Edward's secret, had withheld her from
confessing her sin at once to her aunt, especially when
her uncle had so solemnly denouncel it as theft, and
that when it was discovered it secmed actual relief,
though it brought such severe punishment, for she
knew no suffering for her could be too severe.
The tale, as Ellen told it, was brief and simple cnough,
and that there was any merit in such a system of
self-devotion neer seemed to enter her mind for a
moment; but to Mrs. IInmilton it revealed such an
anmount of suffering and trial, such a quiet, systematic,
heroie endurance, that she nconsciously drew that

love shlould protect her in future from any such trial;-
and from what had it all sprung ' the misery of years,
at a period when life should be so joyous and so free,
that care and sorrow llce it as too purely and too briefly
happy to approach? From a few thoughtless words,
from a thoughtless partial mother, whose neglect nnd
islike had pronouneel that disposition cold, unloving
and inanimate whose nature was so fervid, so imagina-
tie, that the utmost care should hae been taken to
prevent the entrance of a single thought or feeling too
preeocious, too solemn for her years. It may be urged,
nnd with truth, that to an ordinary child the promise
might have been forgotten, or hecdlessly laid nside,
without any harm accruing from it, but it wns from
not caring to know the rcnl character of the little
being, for whose happiness and virtue she was re-
sponsible, that the whole mischief sprung; and it is
this neglect of maternal duty, against which we would
so earnestly warn those who may uot have thought about
it. It is not enough to edncate thc mind, to provide
bodily necessaries, to be indulgent in the gift of pleasure
nnd amuscment, the heart must bc won and taught;
and to lo so with nny lope of success, the character
must be transparent as the day: and what ditticulty,
what hindernnce, can thcre or ought there to be in ob-
taining this important knowlcdge to a mother, from

happiuness, not for childhood alone, though that is
much, but for youth and maturity.
All these tlhoughts pssel throngh Mre. Hamilton's
mind as she listecned to her niece, and looked at thepnle
sweet face lifted up to hers in the earnestness of her
simple tale, as if unconsciously appealiug for her pro-
tection aginst the bewildering and contending feelings
of ler own youg heart. lIow she was effectually
to remove these impressions of years indeed she
knew not; her heart seemed to pray for guidance that
peace ight at length bc Ellen's portion, even as she
heard.
/ You could scarcely havse acted otlerwise than you
hae always done towards Edward, my dear Ellen, under
the influence of such a promise,'' she said; ``yourextreme
youth, naturally enough, could not permit you to dis-
tinguish, whether it was called for by a mere impulse of
feeling in your poor mother, or really intended. But
tell me, do you think it would give me any comfort
or happiuess if I could see Emneline act by ercy
as you hase doue by Elward? To sce her suffer

 IBut how can she, if thcy are not all cqually de-
serving; I wns so different to Edward: he was so hand-

was always fretful and ill, and tley said so oftcn
naughty; and he nsed to fondle poor Mamma, and
show his love, whieh I ws afraid to do, though I did
love her so very much (the tears started to her cyes),
so I could not help fecling he must be much bettcr
than I was, just as I always feel all my cousins are,
and so it wns no wonder poor lamma loved im so
much the best,''
 IIsve I ever made any difference between Edward
and you, Ellen ?'' asked Mrs. Hamilton, conqucring with
no small effort, the emotion called forth by Ellen's simple
words.
 Oh, no, nol'' and she elung to her in almost painful
emotion.  But you are sio good, so kind to everybody;
you would love me, and be kind to me as poor Papa
was, becnuse nobody else could,''
t My denr Ellen, what can I do to remove these mis-
taken impressions? I love you, and your father loved
you, because you hae qualities claiming our love quite
as powerfully as your brother. You must not imagie
because you may be less personully and mentally
fwvoured, that you are in/erior to him, either in the sight
of your Henvenly Father, or of the friends and guardians
He has gien you. And een if such were the case, and
you were ans undeserving as you so wrongly imagine

according to the fountain of loe which, to enable her
to do her dut, God has so mercifully placed in her
eart; and therefore those who have the least attractions
and the most faults, demand the greater cherishing to

to overcome the other. Do you quite understand me,

Ellen's earnest face, on which joy and hope seemed
struggling with doubt, was sufficient nnswer.
All mothers do not think of their solemn responsi-
bilit in the same light; and many causes,-sad recol-
lections and self-reproaches for her earl life, and sepa-
ration in coldness from her father and myself, might all
have tended to weaken your mother's consciousness of
her duty, and so, without any fault in yourself, my
Ellen, hae occasioned her too great partiality for
Edward. But do you remember her last words ?''
Ellen did remember them, and acknowledged they
had so increased her affection for her mother, as to
render the promise still more sacred to her.
I feared so, dearest; but it is just the contrary effect
which they should hae had. When she called yon to her,
and blessed and kissed you as fondly as she did Edward,
she said she had done you injustice, had failed in her
uty to you, and it so grieed her, for it was too late
to atone for it then; she could only pray to God to raisc
you up a kinder parent. I hae trielto be that, for her
sake, as well as your own; and will ou not acknow-

when she had lcarned to fcel as I do, which sle hd

fatal promise, and entreated you not to act upon it vhat
has it ever done but to make you so painfully suffer,
lcnd you oftcn into error, and confirm by coneealment
Elward's faults2
Ellen's tears were falling fast and freely, but they
were hardly tears of pain. lIer aunt's words seemed
to disperse a thicl mist fromu her brain and heart, and
for tle first time, to satisfy her that she might dismiss the
painful memory of hcr promise, and dismiss it without
blae or disobedicnce to hcr mothcr.
MIrs. IIamilton had bcgun the couversation in trem-
bling, for it scemed so difficult to accomplish her objcct
without undue condemmation of her sister; but as lEllen,
clasping hcr arms nbout her neck, tricd to thnk ler

actually diseased. It was not at all surprising; for much
older nnd stronger and wiser persons would have expc-
perienced the same, uuder the same pressure of grief,
and terror and remorse. But what can I o to cure
this morbid imagination, Ellen?'' she continued, play-
fully ; ` scntence you, as soon ns yo get well, to a
course of rathematics, six hours each dny ?''
eI nm afraid my poor hcnd will be more stupid at

 Then I suppose I nst think of somcthing elsc.
Wll you follow Emmeline's example, and tell me every-

indiidually, and more security for the furthcrance of
your happiness, as far as my loe cmn promote it, than

IIcr playfulness had gien place to reneed earnest-
ness, and Ellen, as if in the very thought of such perfeet
confidence dwelt secrity and peace, so long unknown
toher, gave the reuired assurauce so eagerly nnd grate-
fully, that Mrs. IIamilton was satisfied and happy.

Foi that sy Ellen's recovery, though a sal trial
of patience bothi to the young invalid and her affection-
ate nurses, was surely progressive, without any of those
painful relapses which had so triel MIr. MIitland's skill
before. She no longer shrunk fromn the society of her re-
lations, receiing Caroline's and Miss IIareourt's many
kind attentions with surprise indeet, for she could not
imagine wlat could so have altered their feelings towards
her, but with that evident gratitude and pleasure which
encourages a continuance of kindness. Emmeline was
always kind, but it was iudeed happiness to fcel she might
tualk with and share her amusements, as in former days;
nnd that, instead of thinking she ought not to receive
her aunt's affection, the only tling she asked in return
was her full confidence. The inexpressible rest to poor
Ellen which that conversation gave is not to be deserihe.
It was so blessed, so soothing, that it seemed too un-
natural to last, and the secret drcad thather uncle would
not feel towards hcr and lEdward as her aunt did was its
only alloy. Edward, too, was cheerful, and almost
happy when with her; and a long conversation with

MIr. Howard, whieh that worthy man insisted upon
haing as soon as she was strong enough, to remove the
false impressions which his seerity had giren, and
wich never ceased to grieve and reproach him, caused
his almost daily visits to be anticipated by her with as
much gladness as they had before brought dread.
`And now that ansiety for llen is at end, I must
hae you take more care of yourself, Mrs. Hamilton.
Your usband's last injunctions were that I should
nerer pass a week without calling once or twice at
Oakwood to kno ho all was going on, and what

 He little thought how my strength would be tried,

`` ut the weather has been so unusuall temestuous,

pale; ``better the anxiety of not hcnring from him than
the thought of his being at scn in this season,''
Oakwood had resumed its regular hnppy aspect, thongh
Ellen was still npstairs. Morris and Ellis had once more
the happiness of their beloved mistrcss's superintendence,
nnd proud were they both, nas if Caroline had bccn their
own child, to show all she hal done, and so unostenta-
tiously, to save hcr mother trouble, whcn she had been
too anxious to think of anything but Ellen; and the
mother's heart swelled with a delicious feeling of grati-
tude to Him who, if in mnking her so acutely sensible
ofher solemn responsibility, had deepeued and extended
aniety, and had in the same measure hcightened and
spiritunlized yjoy. Tle fruit was indeed worth the nur-
ture, though it might have been ofen washed with tears.
Intensely anxsious as she felt herself, as did also MIr.
IIoward and Mr. Maitland, mnd, in fact, all Arthur
Hamilton's friends, she yet tried to sustain the spirits
of her children, for the young men had eidently grown
anxious on the subject too. It was not nlikely that the
seas round Feroe, anlways stormy, slould prevent any ship
leaving the island, and the young people eagerly grasped
the idca: so painful is it to youth to realize a cause for

In January the weather changed; the tremendous
winds gave place to an almost unnatural calm, and to
such excessive mildness and closeness of atmosphere,
that it affected the henlth of any who were strong, and
not only made Ellen very languid, but frequentl recalled
those dreadfl eadaches whiceh were in themselves au
illness. lBusiness called MIr. IIoward to Dartmouth
near the end of the month, and he preailed on Edward
to accompany im, for wheneer his sister was more
tlan usually suffering his gloom redoubled. The first
Iew dnys were so fine that the chauge renoated him;
MIr, Howard declared it was the sight of old ocean, and
Edard dil not deny it; for though it was good for the
permaneuce of his repentance and resolution to amend,
to hae the influcuce of his home sufliciently long, his

as a long hollow blast moaned and shivered round them,
followed by the roar of a mountainous wnve bursting
on the beaeh.  God hase mercy on all exposcd to its
fury l'' and he gladly turned more inland, while Edward
remained watching its progress with an nlmost pleasur-
able feeling of excitement, only wishing he could but be
on the sea, to enjoy it as snch n storm deserced to be.
As the day drew to a close it incrensed, and as dark-
ness set in, its fury bccame appalling. Blasts, long and
loud as tle reverberation of nrtillery, sueceeded one
anotler witl nwful rapidity, teuriug up huge trees by
the roots, and tiles from1 the roofs. Now and then, at
distant intervals, blue lightning played through the
hlack eavens, betraying that thnder hand mingled with
the wind, though it was impossible to distinguish the
one sound from the other; and as the gusts passed
onwards, streaks of white aud spots of strange unnatural
blue glcamcd through the gloom for a moment's space,
leaving deeper darkness as they disuppenrcd. The ocean,
lashed to vildest fury, rolled in huge mountains of

contrasting strangely with the darkness of earth and
heaen, and burstiug with a sound that eadened for the
time een the wild roar of the blast. To read or even
to converse, in their comfortable quarters in the hotel,
which overloaked the sea, bccame as impossible to Mr.
IIoward as to Edward. About eleven olclock, however,
the wind suddenly veered and lulled, only sending forth
ow and then a long sobbing wail, as if regretful that
its work of destruction was even checked; but the sea
raged ith equal fury, presenting a spectacle as magili-
ficent, ns awful, al giving no appearance of a calm. A
sharp report sounded snddenly from the sea-whether
it was the first, or that others might hae een lost in
the tumult of the winds and waves, who might answerl
Another, and another, at such rapid intervals, that the
dnger was evidently imminent, and ldward started to his
feet. Again-and he could bear it no longer. Hurrielly
exsclaiming, `` They are signals of distress, and close at
handl Something must be done; no sailor can sit still,

lowed y MIr. IIoward, wlo was resolved on preventing
any mad attempt. Crowds of fishermen and townsmen
had congegated on the beacl, drawn by that fcarful
sound, which, by the light fromu the guns, seemed scarcely
half a mile distant; and yet so perilous was the present
appcarance of the ocean, that to go to their assistance
seemed impossible. Suddenly, however, kEdward's voice
exelaimed, with the glad and cager tone of perfect confi-
dence,'` hey can be saved-a strong boat aud two will-

continued, turning eagerly to the group of hnrdy fisher-
men, `` will bc ny assistants in this act of common

 No man who cares for his life'' was the sullen
answer from one of those he addressed, and the rest
stood silent, cying half disdninfully, half admiringly the
slight figure of the yong sailor, revenled as it was in
the fitful light of themany toreles scatteredby the various
groups along the bcaeh. It is well for boys to
talk, we cannot expect old hcads on young shonlders;
but not a boat with my consent leavcs the harbor to-

I tell you I will stake my life on the venture,''
answered Elward, his passion rising high. Am I
speaking to sailors, and can they hesitate, when they
hear such sonnds? Give me but a boat, and I will go
by myself: nnd when you neel aid, may you find those

no thought of the picturceque, his mind was far other-

have ueither parent, nor sister, nor wife to pipe for me,

stalwart young fisherman, advancing, aud Edward eagerly
grasped his rough hand, conjuring him to get his bot

example was infectious, and an old man hastily stepped
forward, declaring the youngsters had taught him his
duty, and he would do it.
 Great God : what do they say?'' exclaimed Edward,
as his younger companion hastened down the beach to
bring his boat to the leeward of te cliff, to launeh it more
securely, and a rumour ran tlrough the crowds, whence
arising it was impossible to discover. `The Syren-

But none could tell more than that a vessel, entering
the harbour just before the gale, al hailed the Syren,
about twenty miles distant, and she seemed labouring
heavily, and in such a distressed state that a ver

With every effort, and they were such as to bid the
perspiration stream down the face and arms of those
strong men, and almost exhaust Edward, for he took
an oar in turn, it was full an hour from their leaving
the shore before they reached the ship. She had
ceased firing, for by the lights on shore they had dis-
coered the boat's departure, and watcled her progress
b the lantern at her head, as only those can watch
who fecel one short hour more and teir ship will float

the boat alongside, had sunk down for the moment

felt the blool slowly trickling down his temple and

scarcely proceeded a third of their way, when the waters
boiled and foamed as tossed by some strange whirlpool,
and it required all Elward's address and skill as steers-
mau to preveut the frail boat from being drawn into
the ortex. The case was soon displayed, and every
heart shuldered, for ten minutes later, and help would
indeed have een in vain. 1he unfortunate vessel had
sunk-been swallowed up in those rushing waters; the
suction of so large a mass, producing for a brief intervnl
the effect of a whirlpool. The silence of awe and of
intense thnnkfulness, fell on the hcart of eery man,
and more than all on his, who had so far recovered his

the boyish figure at the helm, whose voiee was utterly

within a dozen yards of the shore, but still not a sound
of gratulation was heard. Every eye was fied, as in
the fascination of terror, on a wave in the diatance, in-
ereasing in size and fury as it rapidly approached. It
ueaed the boat-it stood impending over the frail thing
as a mighty avalanche of waters-it burst; the boat

shake offa most unwonted gloom. Convinced herself
that it was greatly physical, from the unusual oppressive-
ness of the weather relaxing the ervcs, which had so
many months been overstrained, yet her thoughts
would cling to MIr. MIaitland's words, that her husband
might be coming home himself; but if the accounts of
Ellen's danger nnd ldward's confession had recalled
him, he ought to hae arrired full two or three weels
previous. The gale that swept round her, the awful

tempest, should hecome in that fenrful anxiety almost a
certainty of agony. It was well, perhaps, that her un-
selfish nature had an object to draw her in some slight
degree out of herself, for er firmness, her trust beyond
the accidents of earth, all seemed about to fail her, and
make her for the time being most wretched. As the
storm and closeness increased, so did Ellen's feverish
restlessness: her nerves, not yet full restored, felt
strung almost to torture, with every flash and clap and
blast. She tried to laugh at her own folly, for though
often terrified when a little child at the storms in India,
those of England had never affected her at all, and she
could not understand why she should feel this so child-
ishl. But argument is of little moment in such cases;
nnd MIrs. Hamilton, satisfying her that she could na
more lelp her present sensation than her physical
wenkness, tricd to soothe and amuse her, and in so
doing partially cheered herself. She did not leae her
till past midnight, and then desiring Mrs. Langford to
sit up with her till she was comfortably asleep, retired to
her own bedroo. Never since her husband's absence had
its solitude felt so sst-so heavily opprcssive; thought

gave up the effort to struggle with them.  Will his
voice eer sound hcre again, his heart give me the sup-

and the deep stillness, the gloom only broken by a
small siler lamp, and the fitful light of the fire seemed
but a solemn answer. She buried ler face in her clasped
hands, and the clock struck two before that inward con-

nnd ler bcloved ones; and after an carncest voiceless
rayer, she drew her little table, with its books of de-
votion to the fire, and rend thoughtfully, prayerfully,
for nnother hour, and then sought her couch. But she
conld not slccp; the wind had again arisen, and fcaring
to lie awake and listen to it would only renew her
nusual agitation, she rose at four, dressed hersolf,
and throwing on a large shawl, softly traversed th
passnage, and entered her niece's room; finding her, as
she fully expeeted, as wakoeful and restless as herself,
witl the addition of an intense headache. She hnd
persuaded Nurse Langford to go to bed, but the pain
had come on since then, and made her more restless
nnd feverish than ofore. She could not lie in any
posture to gct ease, till at last, about six o'clock, com-
pletely exhausted, she fell asleep, sitting almost upright
in her aunt's arms, her hend leaning against her as
she stood by the bedside. Tenring to disturb hcr, MIrs.
IIamilton wonld not move, desiring the morning prayers
to be said without her, and MIiss IlIarcourt and her
daughtcrs not to wait breakfast, as she would ae it
with Ellon when she awoke. That she was stif and
exhausted with three hours' standing in one position she
did not heed, perhaps scarcely felt, for woman's lovelicst
attribute, tlat of a tcnde and utterly unselfish nurse,
was hers to perfection. But sh did not refuse the cup

I feel quite strong again, so go and finish your break-
fast in comfort, dearest.''
Cnroline very unwillingly obeyed, and about a quarter
of an hour nfterwards, Irs. IIamilton was startled by the
sound of a crriage advancing with unusual elocity to
the house. It stopped at the main entrance, and she
ad scarcely time to wonder who could be such ery
early isitors, when a loud scream in the voice of
Emmeline rung in her ears; whether of joy or gricf
she could not distinguish, but it was the voice of hen
child, and the already tortured nerves of the wife and
mother could not hear it without a sensntion of terror,
anounting to absolute agony. She Iaid Ellen's head
tenderl on the pillow, watched over her, though he
libs so trembled she could scarcely support herself,
saw with intense relief that the motement had not dis-
turbed her quiet sleep, and calling MIrs. Langford from
an adjoining room, hastily descended the stairs, though

It was some time hefore zhe recovered, for mind and

felt in a moment that great as his anxiety had been for
her, he had not imagined one half she had cndured.

seuses, even more effectually than Miss Harcourt's
anxiously proffered remedies; but she could not speak,
she ouly lookcd up in his face, as if to be quite, quitc
sure he had indeed returned; that her vague fancies
of danger, even if they had fonndation, had merged in the
most blissful reality, tbat she was no longer alone, and,
leaning hcr head on lis bosom, was only conscious of a
thankfulness too dcep for words; a repose that, since his
departure, she had not known for a single day. Ncither

tinued the affectionate girl, kneeling down by her
mother, and clinging to her, nadding, in a suppressed
terrified oice, ``It was so like death,''
MIrs. Hamilton read in a moment that Emmeline's
playfulness was only assumed to hide strong emotion;
that she was trying very hard for complete control,
but so trembling, that she knelt down, literally because
she could not stand. It was such a proof of her en-
deavour to profit by her motler's gentle lessons, that
een at that moment it not only gave her the sweetest
gratification, but helped her to rouse herself.
`Indeed, 1 think yo are perfectly right, Emmy,'' she
said, quite in her usual voice, as she pressed her child a
oment to ler, and kissed her cheek, which was almost
as pale as her own. `I will not submit to any scolding,

MIrs. IIamilton's hand closed convulsively on her

she would grasp his wlrole menning at oncee, but little
did she guess the whole.

posure, and even playfulncss, ``though it scems Iwas such

rejoined Caroline who, at the news of her father having
been in danger, had left the breakfast-table, unable to
kcep away from him, even that short distanee, but
neither she, nor either of the others, connecting her
cousin with Mr. Hamilton's words, and not quite under-

rain and spray hnd so uneurled, ns to lay henvy and
damp upon his pale forehead, she imprinted n long
silent kiss upon it, and looking altcrnately at him and
her husband, seemed powerless to realize any other
thought.
Mr. IIamilton brioly, but most eloquently, narrated
the events of the previous ight, dwelling only suffi-
ciently on his immincnt peril, to evince the real im-
portance of Edward's extraordinary exertions, not to
harow the feelings of his listeners more than need be.
That the young officer's determined opposition to the
almost angrily expressed opinions of Captain IIarvey
and Old Collins as to the better landing-place, had saved
them from the effeocts of the huge wae, which had burst
like a water-spout a minute after thcy had all lcaped in
safety on shore, almost overwehing the projccting sand
to which Collins had wished to direct the boat, and so
proving at once Edward's fnr superior nautical kno-
ledge, for hnd they steered there, the fril bark must
inevitably have bcen upset, and its crew washed by the
receding torrent bnck to sca. Ilarvey and Collins ac-
knowledged their error at once, and looked cagerly for
Edward to say so to him, but he had vanished the
moment thcy had achieved a snfe landing, to Mr.
Hamilton's annoyanee, for le had not hal the least sus-
picion who he was, and only louged to express, if he could
not otherwise cvince, his gratitude. Collins and Grey re-
fusing the smallest credit, declaring that if it had not

nothing, not'en his name, not a man would havc

to have guided the boat to and from the sinkiug vessel,
in such a sea, was so impossible, that noone would have
attempted it; Old Collins ending, with the superstition
of his class, by a declaration, that his disappearance con-
rinced his already more than suspicion, that it was some
good angel in a boy's likeness; for Arthur Hamilton
would neer have been permitted so to perish: an ex-
planation, MIr. IHIamilton added, lauglingly, that might
suit his Emmy, but was rather too fancitul for himn.
Howeer, lis oung preserver wasnowhere to be found,
but, to his extreme astonishment, and no little relief (for
now that he was so near home, his aniety to hear of
all, especially Ellen, whom he scarcely dared hope to
find alise, became insupportable), MIr. Howard suddenly
stood before him, grasping both his hands, without the
power for a minute or two to speak. MIr. Hamilton
overwhelmed him ith questions, scarcely giing hi
time to answer one hefore he asked another. Tey had
nearly reached the hotel, when Captain IIarey's bluff
oice was heard exclaiming-
 Here he is, MIr. Hamiltonl e is too exhausted to
escnpe our thanks and blessings now. What could the
yongster have tried to hide himself for?''
But before Mr. IIamilton could make auy rejoinder,
save to grasp the young man's hands strongly in his
own, MIr, IIovard said, eagerly-
 Oblige me, Captaiun IHIarvey; take that boy into our
hotel, it is only just round the corner; make him take
of his dripping jacket, and give him some of yous
sailor's stuff. He is not quite strong enough for his
cxertions to-night, and should rest at once.''

huried his friend on to the hotel; and entcred the room,
where, having callel for lights and all the ingredients of
gog-punch, which he vowed tle boy should have instead
of the brandy and water he had called for, they found
Edard trying to laugh, and protesting against all

Iarvey had to hc a sailor, if he thought so much of a
storm, and a blow, and a wetting.
 Nor should I, if yo were sailor-igged; but what
business ave you with this overgrown mast of a figure,
and a face pale and delicate as a woman's ?''
And so like his dying mother it was, that Mr. IIamil-
ton stood for a moment on the threshold, completely
stupefiel. Weleave our eaders to imagine the rest; and
how Captain Harvey carried tle seemingly marvellous
ews that the brave young officer was Mr, IIamilton'e

hut, in a miraculously short space of time.
We may as well state herc at once, to save farther
retrospection, that M, IIamilton, by the actie an ad-
mivrnble assistance of Mlorton, had, after a tlhee months'
residence at Feroe, perceivel that hc might return
to England much sooner than he had at first antici-
pated; still he did uot like to mention cven the proba-

himself. MIorton ever ceased persuading him to name
a period for his return, knowing the comfort it would
be to his home; but M. IIilton could not bear the
iden of leaving his friend in his voluntary banishment
so may months sooner than they had reckoned on.
When, loveser, the letters ename irom Oakwood, detailing
Edward's return, and the diseoeries thence procceeding,
his anxiety and, let it be owned, his extremc displeasure
against his nephew, prompted his return at once
MIorton not only conquered every objection to his
immediate departure, but tried, and in somc measure
succceded, to soften his anger, by bringing before im
many points in Mr. IIoward's letter, showing real
good and true repentance in the offender, which a first
pcrsal of a narratie of error had naturally overlooked.
The seas, howeer, were so fearfully tempestuous and thc
winds so aderse, that it was impossible cither to leave
Foroe, or gct a letter conveyed to Scotland, for a full
fortnight after the Syren'slast voyage. Nothing but the
exstreme urgeney of te case, increased by the faet that the
lctention of the Syren nt Wick had given MIr. Homilton

in such wenther; yet he felt he could not rest, knowing
intuitiscly thce misery his wife mnust be enduring, and
scarcely ahle to bcareven thethought of what seemced most
probable, that Ellen would be taken from her, and th
aggravated trial it would bce. The voyage was a terriblc

though the constant shiftings of the wind, which was
now not more than what in sailor's parlance is called a

they desired. At length they were within twenty miles

And how did you get this disfiguring blow, my dear
Edward?'' inquired his aunt, whose eyes it seemed
would turn upon him, as if impossible to connect that
slight figure with such immense exertions,-though some
time hal passed, and a social, happy breakfast, round
which all still lingered, had enabled them to subdue too
painful emotion, and only to be conscious of the most
teep and grateful joy.
Pray do not call it disfiguring, Aunt; I am quite
proud of it. Last night I could havte dispensed with
such a striking mark of affection from the poor Syren,
though I really hardly felt it, exscept that the blood
would trickle in my eye, and almost blind me, when I
wanted allmy sight and senses too. But this morning
Mr. Howard has made such a kind fuss about it, that I
think it must be something grand.''

the room before any one could reply.
 But you will forgive him, Papa; you will try him
again; and I am sure he ill be morally brave too,''
pleadel Emmeline; her sister and Miss IIarcourt joining
in the entreaty and belief, and Mrs. IIamilton looking
in his face, without uttering a word. Mr. IIamilton's
answcer scemed to satisfy all parties,
Lllen meanwhile had awoke, quite refreshed, and all
pain gonc, been lressed, nnd convered to her daily
quarters, the events of the morning entirely unknown to
her; for though the joyful uews, spreadiug like wild-
fire throngh the house, had reached MIrs. Lgford's

enough, cven without a mcssage to that eflect from
her mistress, to keep it from Ellen till carefully pre-
pared.
 What cnn I say to my little Ellen for deserting her

entered her room, about twelve o'clock, after n loug
private conversation with her hushnd.

Ellen tried to sympathise in it; but MIrs. Hamiltou
soon sa thant her perhaps natural drend of what should
beher uncle's judgment on her brothcr and herself, pre-
vented all pleasurable anticipation in his arrival, and
that the only effectual way of removing it was to let

1ttnE ays after Mr. Hamilton's arrival a cheerful
party assembled in his wife's dressing-room, which, in
its clegant appurtenances-signs as they were of a most
efined and benutiful taste-certainly deserved a higher
appellation; but boudoir, Percy had always declnred
did not harmonize at all with the old English comnforts
of Oakwood, and le would not have a EFrench word to
designate his mother's room cspccially. Ellen was on
ler sofa working; Elward, who she thought had only
retmurned that moring, at her side reading; Caroline
and Emmeline drawing, the one with some degree of
perseverance, the other with uone at all. It seeed as
if she could not sit still, and her wild sallies and snatcehes
of old songs repeatedly made MIiss IIareourt look up
from her book, and MIrs. Hamilton from her work, sur-
prised.
Eneline, lI cannot draw,'' exclaimed Cnroline, at
length; ``you are making the table as restless as

can to make you poetical.''
 But whnt am I to poetise on now, Emmeline ?-the
table or yourself? because at present they are the only
subjeets under consideration, and I really cannot see
anything very poetical in either.''
Not cen in me, Lina?'' archly replied kEmmeline,
bending down, so tat her face should come before her
sister instend of her copy, wlich was a very pretty small
marble figure.  Now, if rou were not the most de-
termined piece of prose in the world, you would find
poetry esen in my face,
For, lo the artist no more gazed
On features still and cold;

As living charms unfold.
`As if touch'd by yon orient ras,

For round the lip such bright smiles play,
As never sculptor form'd.
There, Caroline, that is what you ought to lave fel.
If I can make poetry on my own faee-''
 Poetry on yourselt. Why, Emmeline, I thought
you were repeating a verse of some old poet with vieh

as well as worshipper.''
 Nor did I till this moment. She feared for her

Caroline, you night havc emulated Cowper, and instend

think n very pretty poem might be made of it. Look
at the variety of tasteful and useful things laid on a
table-and there it stands in the mist of them, im-
moveable, cold, insensible, just like onc on whom we
heap favours upon favours, and wlo remains so wrapped
in self as to be utterly inlifferent to all. Now, Cnroline,
put that into rhyme, or blanl verse, if you prefer it;
it is a new iden at least.''
So new,'' replied her sister, laughing, ``that I
think I will send it to erey, and request him to turn
it iuto a Greoek or Latin ode; it will be so much grander
than my Euglish version. You have so astonished
MIamma, Emmeline, by your mnad mood, thnt she has

I am so gladl replied Emmcline, springing to her
mother's side; I like other people to be as idle as
mysolf.''
But there is a medium in ll things, young lady,'
answered her mother, half gravely, lalf in Emmelinc's
own tone; ``and I rather think your conscience is
telling you, that it is not quite right to desert one Mluse
for anothcr, as you are doing now,''

you-in plain words, ouly when you feel inclined-
you will fritter lile away without one solid thought or
acquirement. ou think now, perhaps, habituated as
you are to employment, that this is impossible; but you
are just of au age to demand very strict watchfulness
over youself to preent it. Now that you are emerging
from te routine of clildhood's lcssons, and too old to
be compelled to do tlat which is right, and,-rcndering
your tnsk of control still more difficult,-more suscep-
tible to poetry, and what you term inspiration, thau eer,
you must try and infuse a little of Caroline's stendy
matter-of-fact into yor poetry, instead of almost
despising it, as so cold and disagreeable. Now, do not
look so ery sad and so ery serious, love, and jump at
the conclusion that I am displceased, because I speak
seriously. I loe our joyousness far too dearly to
check it, or ish you to do so, cspecially in your own
family; but just as you have lenrned the necessity of,
and cinced so well and so feelingly, control in emo-
tions of sorrow, my kmmeline, so I am quite sure you
ill trust my experience, and practise control, een in
the pleasant inspirations of poctry and joy.''
Emmeline sat ery quiet for several minutes; she
was just in that mood of extreme hilnrity which renders
control excessiely difficnlt, and causcs the least check
upon it to be felt as harsh and unkind, and almost tc
bring tears. Sle was not too perfect to escape feeling
anll this, cven though the person who had caused it was

more than usually warm kiss, she promised to tink
quite seriously on all hcr mother said, and, an effect far
more diticult, was just as joyons as eforec.

though my fingers are employe, at least I may go on

MIrs. IIamilton assented, telling hcr she might talk as
much as she pleased, witl one of those pcculiar silcs of
approval which ever made Emmeline's heart throb, for
they always told her, that tle thoughts and feelings,
and secret struggle with tcmpcr, whieh she imagincd
must be known only to hersolf, her mother by some
mysterious powcr had discovered, and rewardel.

 Yon had better satisfy her curiosity, Emmy,'' said
MIrs. Hmilton, so eaningly, that Emmeline's ready

oecur in that awful storm three days ago, as poetically
and lengthily, ns you like; no one shull intcrrupt
you, if you will only be very careful not to exaggerate
or alarm,''
Edward gave up his seat to his cousin, and Emmeline
launched at onee into a most animnted description of
the storm and the shipreck, and the rescue; cleverly
contriving so to hide all namcs, as to elude the least
suspicion of either the preserved or the preserver
haing anything to do with herself, Ellen beconing so
exceedingly interested, as to lose sight of the question
which at first had struck her, what this could have to do
with Emmeline's wild spirits.

tinued Emmeline, playfully putting back Edward's hair,
that Ellen miglt see the scar, She understood it in a
moment, and clasping her arms round her brother's
neck, as he knelt by her, tried hard to preent emotion,
but could not, and burst into tears.
 Tears, my little Ellen; I said I ould only be
greeted with smiles,'' esclaimed a rich deep voice elose
beside her, and before she had time to fear his presence,
she felt herself clasped with all a father's fondness in
her uncle's arms; er head resting on his shoulder,
and his warm kiss on her cheek.

In a ery few minutes Ellen's composure was so fully
restored, and her hensy dread so subsided, that the relief
seemed to her almost a dream. Could it be possible that

elose by her sofa, and caressingly holding hcr hand in

entertaiuing things about Feroe and Mn. Morton, and
his voyage home, and alluding to her brother's eourage,
and prudence, and skill, in such terms as almost brought
the tears againl Mr. IIamilton was inexpressibly slocked
nt the change wlich ental and bodily suffering had
wrought in his niece. There is always something pecu-
liarly touching and appealing to the best emotions in
youthful sorrow or suffering of any kind; and her trial
had bcen such an aggavated one-combining such
agonised remorse, for an act, which the harshcst judg-
ment, knowing all points of thce case, could scarcely
mponounce as other than involuntary, with the most
heroic but perfectly unconscious self-saerifice, and
not only terror for her brother's fate, but nan almost
crushing sese of miscry for his fults,-that the pallid
face, and frame so dclicately fragile, had still deeper
claims for sympathy and cherishing than even when
caused by ordinary illness. The loss of ler unusually
luxuriant hair, except the soft bands which shaded hcr
face, visille under the pretty little lace cap, nade her
look much younger than sle really was, and so delicntely
transparent had ecome her complcxion, that the bluc
veins were clearly traceble on her forehend, and throat,
and hands ; the dnrl soft lash scemed longer than before,
as it swept the pale clheek, the brow morc pencilled,

expressise of such deep quiet feeling, that the whole
countenancc was altered and so improved that it seemed
as if the heavy sallow child was rapidly changing into
one of thiose sweet, loreable, heart-attracting girls, who,
without any actual beaut, can nerer be passed un-
oticed.
At Ellen's earnest request, MIrs. IIamilton had, as soon
as she was strong cenough, read ith her, morning and
eening, the devotional exercises which were read below
to the assebled family. MIrs. Hamilton soon perceied,
and with no little pain, that Ellen shrunk from the
idea af being wvell enough to rejoin them, in actual
suffering. Here again was an eflect of that snme isid
imagination, of whose existence, until the late erents,
in one so quiet, seemingly so cold, MIrs. Hamilton had
not the least idea of. Ellen had been so loug aceus-
tomed to be silent as to her feelings, in fact, carefully
to conceal them, that much as she might wisl and
intend to be unreserved, her aunt feared it would cause
her some difficult to he so, and sle could not hope
to succecd in controlling imagination unless she ere.
That niglt, however, Ellen's unresered confidence gave
her hope. When the devotional esercises, in vhich
she had joined with een more than usual earnestness
and fervour, were concluded, she said, with almost
Emmeliue's confidence, as she laid her hand on her
aunt's,

MIy sin remains the same in IIis sight, though you and
Unele IIamilton hae so fully forgiven it, and-and-
I do not think I ought to feel so lappy.''
 Indeetl, my dear Lllen, I think you may. Our
heavenly Father is still more mereiful than man, as
M. Ioward so clenrly proved to you, in the long
conversation you had with him. We know, by His Holy
Word, that all He asks is sincere repentance for sin,
and a firm conviction that in Ilim only we are madc
sufficiently righteous for our penitence to be accepted.
I believe, Ellen, that IIis forgiveness was yours, long
hefore I could gie you mine, for He could read your
heart, and sns the reason of your silence, and all the
remorse and suffecring, which, from the appearances
against you, I might uot even guess; and that, in IHis
compassionating love and pity, IIe permitted your in-
creased trial; ordaining even the failure of the relief to
Edwsard, to conince you, that, not een in such a fearful
case as yours, might crror, however involuntary, prosper.
I can tace His loving providence even in the fact of
your finding one more note than you wanted, that
discovery might thence come, which, without such a
seeming chance, was, humanly speaking, impossible. IIc

eery thought, and beliese me, my own Ellen, your
very happiness will both lraw you nenrer to Him, and
be an acceptable offering in his sight.''
Ellen listened eagerly, gratefully; she felt as if, with
every vord MIrs. Hamilton sait, the film of doubt and
ague fancies wns dissoling from her mind, nnd, after
a short pause, she said-
1hen you do not think, Aunt Emmeline, my
inability to pray for so long a time, was a proof that
God had utterly forsaken mel lt made me still more
wretched, for I thought it was a sure sign that I was
so irredeemably wicked, IIe had left me to the deices
of my own heart, and would never loe or hae mercy
on me again. Eren after you lad quite forgiven me,
and proved to me my promise was a mistaken one and
not binuding, I still felt the difficulty to pray, and it was
so painful.''
Such innbility is very often so entirely plysical,
my denr Ellen, that we must not think too mucl about
it. Our simple duty is to perseere, howeer little
satisfactor our deotions; and put our firm trust in
onr heavenl Father, that He will eal us, and permit
His countenance so to shine upon us again, as to derive
cofort from our prayers. Your inability before your
illncss was the natural consequence of MIr. Howard's
severe representations, whieh he has since nassured me,
he never would have used, if he could have had the least

and I am not at all anstonishcd, that when you mst
carued for thc comfort of prayer and trust, thc thought
that by your silcnce you werc failing in your duty to
me nnd so disobeying Gol, should utterly have pre-
vented it. Since yom sevcre illness the inability has
bcen centirely physical. As strength and peace return,
you will regain the powcr, and realize all its com-
fort. Try, and under all feelings trust in and love
God, and do not be too much elated, wlen you can think
seriously and pray joyfully, or too desponding wen
both fail you. In ou prcsent state, plysical causes
alone, so often oecasion thesc diferences of feeling in
hous of devotion, that if we thought too much about
them, we should constantly think rong, and be very
miserable. Try and provc your desire to love and serve
God, in your dily conuet and seeret touhts, my
Ellen, and you will e able to judge of your spiritual
improement by action anl feelin, far more truly and
justly than by te mool in which you pray,''
Tle earncestness of truth and feeling was always so
impressed on Irs. Hamilton's manner, whcenever she
addressed her youthful charge, that her simplest word
had weiglt. IIappy indcel is it whcn youth-that
season of bewildcring doubt and question, and visid,
often mistaken faucies, and too impctuous feeling-has
thc rich blessing of such afcctionate counsels, such a
friend. WIy will not woman rise supcrior to the petty
employments and feclings too often alone attributed to
her, nand endeavour to fit orself for such tlhice blessed

A fortnight after Mr. Hamilton's arrival, Ellen was
wcll cnongh to go down stairs for part of the day, and
eren to rcad and writea little. Shc was so very anxious
to recommence her studies, which for so many months
had been so painfully neglected, that it was a great
trial to her, to find her head was not yet strong enougl
for the uecessary application. There were many, very
many priations and trials, attendant on conalescence
nfter so serere an illness, known only to Ellen's own
heart, and to her aunt's quick sympathy; and she very
quickly learncl in them the meaning of Mrs. Hamiltou's
words regarding religion iu conduct and feeling, as
well as in prayer. She tried nerer to murmur, or dwell
on the wish for plensures which were denied ler, but
to think only on tle many blessings which surrounded
her. It was not an easy task so to conquer natural
feeling, especially as the trial and its conquest was often
known only to herself; but the earnest wish, indeed,
to become holy in daily conducet, as well as in dnily
prayer, never left her miud, and so enabled her at
length fully to obtain it.
If MIrs. Hamilton had wanted eridence of her hus-
bnnd's public as well as domcstic worth, she would have
had it fully now. IIis danger and his preservation onc

CHAPTER YIT.
THE RICH aAND TIIE POOR.

 WE hne had such a deliglhtful excursion, lamma.
Ellen, how I do wish ou could hase been witl us''
joously exclaimed Emmeline, as she ran iuto the
usual sitting-roon, one of those loely afternoons, that,
the first days of MIarch so often bring, promising sping
long before she really comes. `It is such a picturesqe
cottage, and Dame Collins and Susan, and a host of
little ones, look so nice, and so clean, and so pretty, and
happy; it does one's heart good to look at them.''
``Are you sure you cannot find another adjectie to
apply to them, ELmmy? You hae heaped so many
together, tlat it is a pity you cannot find a few more.''
 ut they really do look so comfortable, and are so
grateful for all you and Papa have done for them:
Emmeline's description, for once, is not too flowing,''
rejoined the quieter Caroline, who had followed er
sister into the room.
And were they pleased with your visit ?'' asked
Ellen.
Oh, delightedl particularly at our making their
pretty little parlour our dining-room, and remaining so

long with them, that they conld sbow us all their
comforts and convenicnces, without any bustle.''
Mrs, Collins is really a sensible womn. bDo you
not think so, Mamma ?'' inquired Caroline.
 Ycs, my dear. She has brought up her own large
family and her poor orphan grandchildren so atmi-
rably, in the midst of their extreme poverty, and bears
such a name for kindness, amongst her still poorer
neighbounrs, that I truly reepect and admire her. Sle
is quite one of those in whom I have often told you
some of the very loftiest virtues are to be found; and
yet to see her, as she trudges about in her homely
humble fashion, never dreaming shce is doing or has
lone anything remarkable in her hard-working life, who
would suspect it''
 Only look, Ellen, how bcnutifully our collection
ill be increased,'' continued lmmeline, who just at
that moment was only alive to pleasure, not to con-
templation, een of goodness, in which she much
lclighted, and pouring into her cousin's lap a basket
of benutiful shells and other mnarine trensures. `Papa
has just gien us a new cabinet in time, though he only
thought of it as a plaee for his Feroe curiosities.
To think of his remembering our tastecs even therel''
ut where did you get these from ?''
 Why, the children were playing with some, which
were so perfeet, I could not help admiring them, and
Mrs. Collins was in a bustle of pleasure tht I liked
anything so trifling, bcause she coull gratify ne, and
she made me take all these, andding, that her good
man would be sure to look out for some more for us;

25l
for when I told her, they not only plcased me, but
my poor iuvalid cousin, who was Edward's sister, you
should hare seen how her eyes sparkled.''
Oh, you hae quite won the dae's heart, Emmy '
said MIiss Harcourt.  What with talking to her
and to Susan, and playing with eer one of the
children, and making them tell you all their plays
nnd their schooling, and tlen gathering you a
nosegay, telling them it slould adorn your room at
home '
`And so it shall,'' gaily interrupted Emmeline,; I
desired Robert to put them in water direetly, for they
were very pretty, nnd I like them better tha te best
bouquet from our greenhouse.''
I do not quite agree with you, Emmeline,'' said
Caroline, smiling.
 Not rou, Lina, who eer thouglt you would? by-
the-by, I neer saw you so agreeable and natural in a
poor man's cottage in my life, What were you saying
to Dame Collins? actually holding her hand, and some-
thing very bright shiing in your eye.''
 Deanr Emmy, do not run on so,'' whisperel Ellen,
as she noticed Caroline's cheek crimson. Emmeline
was at her side in a moment, with an arm round er
neck.
 Cnroline, dear, forgie me. I did not mean to
tease you; only it was unusual, was it not?''
I was trying to tell MInrs. Collins all I thought of ler
husband's share in saing our dear father, Emmy. I
forgot all of folly and pride then.''
252
IIoOMIE IYFIUENCI..
 Yon are ery seldom nroud now, dearest Lina, and
I was the foolish one not to have guesscd what you
were saying, witout tormenting you. MIamma, do
you know I have such an almirable plan in my heal ?''
First tcll Manmma,'' interrupted Caroline, that
WVilliam Gray has choscn to be a partner with Collins in
the more extended fishing and boating business, which
Papa has secured them, instead of entering into busi-
ness by himself; this las been settled since you were
there, I tlink.''
 Yes, my dear, I lid not know it ; but Mrs. Collins
must like it, for she regrettcd very much that her sons
were all scattered in diffcrent trades, and ier little
grandson, whose taste pointel to the sea, not old cnough
to go out with his grandfather.''
 But only listen to my plan, MIamma, dearl William
Gray and Susan Collins cannot possibly see much of
each other, withont falling in love; and they will make
such an industrious pretty couplc, and Papa will give
them a cottage to themselves, and I will go to their
wedding l''
Just such a plan as I should expect from your
giddy brain, Emmy. But how do you know that Gray
has any desire for a wife?'
 Oh, because Edward said he coul not help remark-
ing, cven in the midst of that awful scene, how mourn-
fully he said, he would bear a hand, for he had neitler
mother, sister, nor wife to pipe for him; now if he mar-
riod Susan, he would have a very pretty wife to lament
him

253
Poor Susan, I faney sle wouldrather not become his
ife, if it he only to mourn for him, Emmy; rather a
novel reason for a marriage, certainly.''
Oh, but MIamma dearl you know thnt I dont mean
exactly and only that; somebody to be interested for
him, and lore him. No one can be happy without
that.''
` Susan was telling me, Mamma, how thankful sheis
to ou, for finding her and her sister employment,
that they might be able to lelp the family,'' rejoined
Caroline. I was quite pleased with her manner of
speaking, and she blushed so prettily when MIiss
Harcourt praised the extreme neatness of her work,''
 Al, MIamma, if you conld but hear all they say of
you:'' again burst forth Emmeline, who it seemed
could not be quiet, going from one subject to ano-
ther ith the same eager zest; 'if you had but
eard the old dame tell her astonishment and her
pride, when se saw ou enter their former miser-
able hut, and sitting down on an old sea-clhest, in-
ite her to tell, and listened to all her troubles, just
as if you had been er equal, and left such comfort and
such hope behind you, as hnd not been theirs for many
a long day. She actually cried when she spoke, and
so did I, because she spoke so of my mother. Oh,
MIother, darling, how proud your echildren ouglt to be,
to belong to one so beloved, so reered by tle poor and

evcn from you. Beliee me, darling, to win lote
and respect is so easy, so delightful, that there is no
merit in obtaining it. We ought only to be thankful,
when granted such a station and such influence as will
permit cxstended usefulness and thought for others,
without wronging our own.''
 Yes; but, Miamma, many people do a great denl of
good, but somclow or other tlhey are not bcloed,''
 Because, perhaps, in their earnest desire to accom-
plish a great denl of good, they may not think quitc
enough of little things, and of the quick sympathy with
othcr person's feelings, whicl is the renl secret of win-
ning love, and without whicl, sometimes even the
greatest henefit is not alued as it ought to be. But
did you see Old Collins limsel?'
 He came in just before we left, and was so delighted
to see Papa sitting in his inglenook, and ouly wished
Edward had been there too,''
And whre is your father'' askel Mrs. Hamilton.
Did he not rcturn witl you ?''
 Yes, but Edward wantel im, and they are iu the
library. I am quite certain there is some conspiracy
between them; these long private interviews bode no
good. I shll scold Papa for being so mysterious,''
said Emmelinc.
I rather think he will return the bcenefit, by scold-
ing you for bcing so curious, Emmy. But here is
Edward, so the intorview to-day has ot bcen vcry
long.''
IHas Papa been telling you Old Collins's naval
news, Ne?'' Aud, withount waiting for an answer, she

continued, ` that there is a fine seventy-four, the Sea
Gueen, preparing at Plymouth, to tke the place of
your old ship, and send back Sir Edward MIanly and
the Prinee William. Now do not tell me you know
this, Edward, and so disappoint me of the rare pleasure
of telling news,''
I am sorr, Emmy, but I hase known it for
some weeks.''
And wh did you not tell us ?''
Because I did not think it would particularly in-
terest yon, until I conll adl other iutelligence to it.''-
IHoe stopped, and looked alternately at MIrs. Hanilton
and Ellen, as if asking the former whether he might
proceed.
``Aud can you do so now, my dear Edwad?'' she
replied, understanding him at once.  Ellen is toa
anxious for your adancement to expect, or wish you
always to remain with her. Hae you your appoint-
ment ?''
Yes, Aunt. My Unele's letter to the Admiralty
brought an answer at last. It came while he was out,
and has been tantalizing me on the libary-table for four
lours. But it is all right. As the Prince William ia
returuiug, and I am so anxious to be still in active ser-
vice, I am permitted, though somewhat against rule,
to have a berth in the Sea ucen. I am sure it is all
Uncle Hamilton's representations, and I am so thank-
ful, so gladI'

earnestly at her brother all the time he spoke, and then
turned hor face away, and a few quiet tears tricklel
down her cheek. Ldward's arm was vcry quickly round
er, and le whiserced so many fond words and earnest
assuranees, united with his conviction that it would
still be a whole month, pcrhaps more, before he
should bc summoned, as he had lcnve to remain with
his family till the ea ucen as ready to sail, that she
rallied her spirits, and, after remaining very quiet for an
hour, which was always her custom when she had had
any struggle with herself, for the frame felt it,-though
neither word nor sign bctrayed it,-she was ecnabled
fully to enjoy the grand deliglt of the cening-Percy
and Hcrbert's arrival.
Enster week was indeed one of family joy nnd thank-
fulness, not only that they were all permitted once more
to be togethcr, but that the heasy clouds of sin and suf-
fering had rolled away from their roof, and pleasure of
thc sweetest, ost cenduring, because most domestic
kind, reigned triumphant. Percy's astonishmnt at
Edward's growth, and the alteration from the handsome,
joyous, rosy boy, to the pale, almost care-worn looking
youth (for as long as Ellen bore such rivid traces, of
nll she had cndured for his sake, and was, at it were, the
constant presence of his errors, Edward tried in vain to
recover his former spirits,) was most amusing.
 You are all deccivcd,'' he would declare; ``one of
these days you will discover yo hae been receiving a

like the cange at all; poor fellow l'' he added to him-
self, ``it is not much wonder.''
The lays passed much too quickly. Emeline wished
a dozen times that the dnys would be twenty-four instead
of twele hours long. The weather was so genial that it
andded to enjoyment, and allowed Ellen the delight,
known only to such prisoners to sickness as she had
been, of driviug out for an hour or two at a time, and
taking gentle walks on the terrace nnd in tbe garden.
Tle young men were to return on the MIonday, and on
the Saturday previous a little excursion had been
planned, to which the only drawbnek was that Ellen
as not quite strong enough to accompany thcm: it
as to visit Alice Seaton, whom we mentioned in a
former chapter. Mr. IIamilton had succeeded in find-
ing ber brotler lucratise employment with a lawyer in
one of the ncighbouring towns, a fcw miles from where
she and her aunt now lired, enabling young enton to
spend every Sabbath with them; and Alice now kept a

so wcell as neser to want sclolars. It had heen a long

were both at home and at lcisure thce last day in Easter,
it had becn fixed upon for tle visit. Percy was revelling
in tlc idea of driving his mother and Miss IIarcourt in
a new barouche, and tle rest of the party were to go on
horseback. But a dispute had ariscn who should stay
with Ellen, and Edward insisted upon it, it was Iis
right, and so they thought it was agreed.
I wish, dear Pcrcy, you would prevail on Edward
to accompany you,'' pleadel Ellen, fancying herself alone
with him, not seeing HIerbert who was reading at a
distant table.
I wish, dear Ellen, you wvere going with us,'' he
answered, mimicking her tone.
 But as I cannot make him go. It always makes
him more unhappy when I am prevented any pleasure
than it does myself; and I cannot bear to keep him by
me four or fivee hours, whcn this lovely day, and the
exsercise of riding, and, above all, your company, Perey,
would make him, at least for the time, almost his own
merry self agnin.''
 Thanks for the implied compliment, cousin mine,''
repliel Percy, with a low bow.

myself enough, I can tell you, and I owe you a grudge
for doing so.''
Dear Percy, what can you mean? If you knew
how hard I find it to be patient sometimes, you would
not praise me.''
I mean that the last time I was at ome, I was
blind and cruel, and added to your sufferings by my
uncalled-for harshess, and neer had an opportunity
till this moment to say, now grieved I was-wlen the
truth was known.''
`Pray do not say anything about it, dear Perey,''
entreated his cousin, the tenrs starting to her eyes, as
he kissced her warmly; ' it was only just and natural
you should have felt indignant with me, for causing
Aunt Emmeline so much misery, and alloying all the
enjoyment of your holidays. I am sure you need not
reproach youtrslf;--but will you make Edward go?''
I it really will oblige you, Ellen; but I do not
half like it,'' And he was going ery reluctantly, when
he met Herbert.
You need not go, Perey,'' he ssid, smiling; ``my
ungracious cousin would not depnte me as her mes-
senger, but I made mself such, and so suecessfully
that Edward will go, Ellen.''
Dear IIerbert, how can I thank you enougll he
will be so much happier with you all,''

ngracious as your words, I would run away from yo
into my own room; but as they are rather more gratifying
to my self-love, we will send thcem all away, and enjoy
our own quict pleasures and your little drie together,
Lell.''
Whatever Ellen might have said to conince him shc
conld e happy alone, the beaming lool of pleasure on
her countenance satisfied all parties as to the cxcellcnce
of this arrngement; and happy, indeed, the day was.
Herboert seemed to understand her unexpressed feelings
so fully; and that always makcs thc charm of conver-
sation, whatever its subject. We do not require the e-
pression in words of sympathy,-it is an indescribable
something that betraysits existence. Favorite authors-
and Herbert was almost surprised at Ellen's dawning
taste and judgment in literature-the delights of Nature
after a long confinement, as if every flower were more
sweet, every bit of landscape, or wood, or water more
beautiful, and the mauy holy thouglts and pure joys
spriging from such feclings, were all discussed, either
cosily in their sitting-room, or in their ramble in the
garden; and after Ellen's early dinner, which IIerbert
shared with her as lunch, she proposcd what she
knew he would like, that her drive should bc to Groevillc
Manor, and thcy might spend a full hour with thieir
friends, and yet be back in time. Herbert assented
gladly; and the warm welcome they receivel, Mrs
IIOMIE INELUENCE.
261
Groeille's kind care of Ellen, and Mary's eager chat
with her and Hoerbert, and the number of things they
seemed to fiud to talk about, made the hour literally
fly ; but Herbert, enjoyable as it was, did not forget his
charge, and drote her baek to Oakwood, while the sun
still shone bright and warmly: and when the party re-
turned, which they did only just in time to dress for
dinner, and in the wildest spirits, the balance of pleasure
at home and abroad, would certainly hare been found
quite equal.
Ellen still continued quietly to lie down in her
own room while the family were at dinner, for she
was then sufficiently refreshed to join them for a few
hours in the eening. Perecy and Emmeline, at dinner
that day, kept up such a flre of wit and mirth, that it
was somewhat diflicult for any one else to edge in a
word, tlough Edward and Caroline did sometimes con-
trie to bring a whole battery against themselves. Just
as the dessert was placed on the table, howerer, sounds
of rural music in the distance, adancing nearer and
nearer, caused Percy to pause in his wild sallies, and
spring with Edward to the window, and their excla-
mations soon compelled all the party to follow their
example, and send for Ellen to see the unexpected sight
too. Banners and pennons floated in the sunshine, and
the greater part of the nautical inhabitants of Dartmouth
were marshnlled in goodly array beside them, headed
by Captain larvey and his crew, with Old Collins in
the midst of them; they were all attired in the ne
clothing which MIr. Hamilton had presented to them;

face, the very pcculiar curls in which his rcally yellow
hair was twisted, and the quid of tobacco, from whieh
even, on tlis grand occasion, he could not relieve his
mouth and cleek. A band of youug mcn and girls
surrounded the first banner, which, adorned with large
bunches of primoscs nnd violets up the staff, bore the
words `` IInmilton and Benevolence;'' nnd amongst
themn Emmeline speedily recoguized William Grey and
Susan Collins, walking side by side, she looking down
and smiling, and he so earestly talking, that she whis-
pered to her mother with the greatest glee, that her
plan would take place after all. Then came a band of
sturdy fishermen, chums and essmates of Collins,
and then a band of boys and girls, from all MIr. Hamilton's
own village schools, decked in their holiday attire, and
holding in their hands tasteful garlands of all the
spring flowers thcy could muster, nnd bearing two large
hanners, one with the words,  Fortescue for everl All

of tle scene on the beach that eventful niglt, and the
sinking vessel in the distance. The workmanship wns
rude indeed, but the efiect so strikingly descriptive, that

grasped almost unconsciously the arm of her nephew as
he stood by her, as if the magnitude of the danger, both
to him ad er husband, had never seemcd so vivid
before.

they halted; tle music cecased, and cheer on cheer re-
sounded, till the very echoes of the old park,were startled
out of their sleep, nnd sent the shout back again. Percy
was amongst them in a moment, singling out Old Collins,
whom he had tricd repeatedly to see since is visit
lome, but neer found him, and grasped and shook
botl his hands with the full vehemence of his character,
pouring out the first words that chose to come, which
better expressed his gratetul feelings to the old man
than the most studied speech. William Grey had alrcady
received substantial proofs of his gratitude, and so hc
had then only a kind nod, and a joke and look at the
pretty, blushing Susan, which said a sast deal to both,
and seemed as if he quite seconded Emmelinec's plan,-
mingling joyously with all,-he had bluff words, after
their own hearts, for the men, smiles for the maidens,
and such wild jokes for the children, as lost them all
decorum, and made them shout aloud in thcir glee.
Herbert seconded him quite as well as his quicter
nature would allow. Edward had hung back, een
hen his name was called outlustily, as if he could not
benr such homnge.
Join them, my boy; their humble pleasure will not
be half eomplete without ou,'' whispered MIrs. IIamil-
ton earnestly, for she gucsscd his thoughts.  Remember
only at this moment the large amont of happiness you

The clond dispersed from brow and heart in a mo-

almost as Percy, while the cheer which greeted him
was almost overpowering to his sistcr, so much humble
yet enrncst feling did it speak.
You really should have gien us timely notice of
your iutentions, my good fricnd,'' said Mr. HIamilton,
warmly graspiug Captain Harvey's hand. ` At least
we might have providel some substantial refreslent
after your long march, as I fenr we have but slender
fare to offer you, though Ellis and Morris are busy
nlready, I nm happy to sce.''
Anl urged on by their own delight at this homage both
to their mnster and his young preserver, who hal
become a complete idol amongst them, a long table was
spcedily lnid in the servants' hall, covered with a variety
of cold mecats, and bread and chcese in abundanee, and
horns of cydcr sparkling brightly heside each trencher.
Fruit and cakcs eagerly sought for by Emmeline, were
by her distributed largely to thc children, who remained
variously grouped on thc lawn, their glee at the treat
lieightenedby the sweet and gentlc manner of its bestowal.

The talents of his sisters had been so cultivated, as a
means of enlancing home-happiness, and inereasing
teir own resources, that their musical evenings were
always perfect enjoyment. Cnroline, indeed, improed
as she was, still retained her love of admiration suffi-
cieutly, to find still greater enjoyment in playing and
singiug when there were more to listen to her, than
merely her own faiiy, but tle feeling, in the security
and pure atmosphere of Oakwood, was kept under control,
and she ceoul find real pleasure in gratifying her brothers,
though not quite to the same estent as Emmeline.
Percy, after comfortably settling Ellen, threw himself
on the most luxurious chair he could find, stretched out
his legs, placed his head in what he called the best
position for listening and enjoying, and then called for
duets on the harp and piano, single pieces on both, and
song after song with the most merciless rapidity.
 Your sisters shall ncither play or sing to you any
more,'' lis mother, at lengtb, lauglingly said, ``unless
you rouse yourself from this disgracefully idle fit, and
take your lute, and join them.''
Mother, you are lost to every sensation of mercyl
after all my exertions, where am I to find breath?''
 You hare had plenty of time to rest, you lazy
fello; letting your sisters fatigue themselves without
remiorse, and refusing your share,'' exspostulated Edward.

It was so very close to him as he approached the
piano, that his sister comicnlly took his hand, and
placed it on it, and two or tlree very pretty trios were
pcrformed, Percy declared with professional clat.
Now don't go, Percy, we want your voice in a song.

Papa so much to er; Percy aud I will join when

Caroline, I hae not the genius to sing at sight.''
Ol, you have often. and the words will inspire you.
Come, Herbert, we want you, too; Elward's singing
voice has deserted him, or I should enlist him also.
Emmeline, what are you waiting for ?''
I cannot sing it, dear Caroline; do not ask me,''
answered Emmeline, ith a confusion and timidity,
which at home were perfectly incomprehensible.
 WVhy, my little Emmy, I am quite curious to hear this
new song; do not disappoint mel'' said her father, cn-
couragiogly.
 But after Caroline I cannot sing worth hearing,'
still pleaded Emmeline.
 MIy dear child, I never heard you make such a
foolish excuse before; your mother and myself never
find any difference in the pleasure that listening to
your music bestows, howover one performer may be
more naturally gifted than the othoer.''

of Tiny's refusing,'' said Percy, laughing. Come,

The words, howeer, seeed sufficiently satisfactory
for them readily to join in it. Emmeline still hesitated,
almost painfull; but then gathering courage, she sat
down to her harp, and, without any notes before her,
played a few bars of one of those sweet thrilling Irish
melodies, so suited to her instrument, and then com-
menced her song, the sweetuess of her oice, and clear-
ness of articulation atoning well for her deficiency in
the power and brillianc which characterized her sister.
The words were exsceedingly simple, but suug with deep
feeling, and heart-appealing as they were, from the
subject, we hope our readers will judge them as
leniently as Emmeline's hearers.

Emmeline's voice had at first trembled audibly, but
seeming to derie courage from her sister and brother's
accompaniment, whicl, from their kowledge of music,
was so beautifully modulated as to permit her swcet
voice to be heard above all, and every word clearly
distinguished, it became firmer and more earncst as she
continued, till she forgot everything but the subjcct of
her song. For full a minute there was silence as she
ceased, but witl an irresistible impulse Mr. Hamilton
rose from his seat, and, as Emmeline left her harp, he
clasped her in his ars.
 How can I thank you, my Emmeline, and all
my children, for this fond greeting?'' he cxclaimed,
with more emotion than le generally permitted to be
visiblo.  Whero could you find such appropriate

Percy, as Emmeline, breaking from her father, sat lown
on her faorite stool at her mother's feet, and hid her face
in her lap. Mrs. Hamilton laid her hand caressingly
on those soft curls, but, though she smiled, she did
not speak.
She ill not tell, and you will none of you guess,''
said Cauroline, laugling.

 Not I; I am pledged to silence.''
Mother, dear, tell us for pity,'' pleadel IIerbert.
I can only guess, for I am not in her confidence, I
assure you,'' she replied, in the samce playful tone, and
raising lmmeline's lowered hend, she looked a moment
in those conscious eyes.  Dietated by my Emmeline's
affectionate little leart, they were found in this pretty
shape, in the recesses of her own fanciful brain-is not
that it, dearest?''
There, Emmy, I knew Mamma would find it out,

as her sister's face was again concealed.

poetry. To an well-regulated ind and temper, the
dangcr is not of thc same serious kind, as to the irregu-
lated, but merely consists, in the powerful temptation
it too often prescnts to neglect dutics and eployments
of more consequence for its indulgence. There is a
spccies of fascination in the conposition of even tlc
most inferior poetry, which urges its pursuit, as giving
so littlc trouble compared to the pcrseveranee necessary
for music and drawing, and such a ast amount of
pleasure, that it is difficult to withdraw from it. TlhIis
is still more strongly thle case when the young first
become conscious of the gift, as Emmeline is now. As
she gets older, and her taste improses, she will not be
satisfied with her efforts, unless they are very supcrior
to the present, and the trouble she will take in correct-
ing and improving, will rcmove a great deal of the
too dangerous fascination attending it now; still I am
ot anxious, while she retains her confidence in my
nffection and experience, and will so control thc enjoy-
mcnt, as not to permit its interference with her othe
more serious employments.''
Ellen listencd eagcly, and they continued conversing
on many similar topics of interest and improvement,

MIs. IInmilton had neer ceasel to regret the dis-
grace she had inflietel on Ellen, in not permitting her
to retain her own place ith the family, at least in thc
hours of derotion, for it seeed more difficult to remove
that impression than auy of ler other trials. Returuing
he niece's startled look with one of tle sincerest affec-
tion, she said-
 You will remain with us to-night, my dear kllen,
will you not ?''
If you wish it, Aunt.''
I do wish it, dearest, most earncstly. It is so long
since I hae had the lappiuess of seeing all my clildren

appearance, the universal sympathy which her dnnger-
ous illness and its causc had cnlle forth, even in the

which though they preventcd her following the words
of the prayers, and caused the tenrs, spite of every effort,
to strenm through her slender fingers, yet turned into
thankfulness and praise, ere the service ceased, that fiery

your resolution, but only to preent one fault becom-
ing many by concealment-from dread of anger, and
therein the supposel impossibility of amendment.
Remember, my beloved boy, you have a claim on me
which no error nor fault can reove; as, under Provi-
dence, the preserver of my husband, I can never change
the anxious love I bear you. You my indeel male me
very miserable, but I knaow you willnot: you will let me
look on your noble deed with all the loe, the admira-
tion it deserves. Promisc me that, under any difficnlty
or error, small or great, you will rite to me as you
would have done to your own beloved mother, and I
shall hasre no fear remaining.''

With Ellen, too, lrs. IInmilton's anxious care was
bringing in fair promisc of success-the mistaken in-
fluences of her childlood, and their inercased effect from
a morbid imagination, produced from constant suffering,
appearing indeedabout to be holly eradicated. Anxious
to remoe all satd associations connected with the
library, MIrs. Hnmilton, having dcterined herself to
superintend lEllen's studics, passed long mornings in that
ancicnt room with her, so deligltfully, that it becnme
associated only with thce noble authors whose works, or
extracts from wlom, she read and reclled in, aud

whicl filled er mind with sucl new thoughts, such
expausivc ides, such caling aund earuest trutls, that
she felt becoming to hersclf a new being. Lively and
thoughtless as Emmcline she could not now indeed
becomc, alike as their dispositions naturally were; but
she was more quietly, enduringly happy than she had
ecr remcmbered herself.
here was only one alloy, one sad thought, that wonld
intrude, causing a resolution, which none suspected;
for, open as she had become, she could breathe it to
one but Ellis, for she alone could assist her, though it
rcquired many, many pcrsuasions and many assurances,
that she never could be qite happy, uunless it was
accomplished, which could preail on er to grant it.
Ellen knew, felt, more and more each week, that she
could uot rest till she hnd laboured for, and obtainel,
and returnel into her aunt's hands the full sum she
had so involuntarily appropriated. Te only means
she could adopt demanded such a seemingly interni-
nablc period of self-denial, patienee, and perseverance,
that at first, as Ellis represented and magnified all con-
ccted with it, sle felt as if indeed she could not nerve
herself for the task, much as she esired to perform it;
but praycr cnabled her to face thc iden, till it lost its

Greatle to Caroline's deliglt, the following October
wns fixed for them to lease Oakwood, and, after a
pleasant tour, to make the long anticipated isit to
London. There would then be thtee or four months quiet
for her to have the benefit of masters, bofore sle was
itroduccd, and MIrs. Hnmilton fondly hoped, that the
Ilast year's residence at home, fraught as it had
been with so mucl of domestic trial, and displaying
so many honeful and admirable traits in Caroline's
disposition, would hae lessened the danger of tho
ordeal of admiration and gaiety which she so
dreaded for her child-whether it had or not, a futurc
page 'ill disclose.
1o Emmeline this arrangement was a source of ex-
treme reget indiidunlly, in whioch Ellen now quite
sympathised. lSut Emmeline had never forgotteu her
mother's gentle hint, that too great indulgence of regret
or sorrow becomes selfishness, and she tried ery lard
to create soe anticipation of pleasure, een in London.
Ellen would not look to pleasure, but merel tried to
think about-and so, when called upon, cleerfully to
resigu thnt which was now so intensely enjoyable-her
studies with her aunt; and so benefit by them, as to gie
MIiss IIarcourt no trouhle hen she was again under her
care; ns she knew she and Emmeline must be, more than
they had been yet, when Caroline' s introduction, and
tleir residence in London, would take Ir. and MIrs.

IIOMIE INFLUINCL.
It was again the 7th of June, and Ellen's birth-
day. Accustomed from the time she became an imatc
of Oakwood to regard the anniversary of hcr birth in
the same seious light as MIrs. Hamilton had taught
her cousins-as a day of quict reflection, as well as of
thaunkfulness and joy, as one that closing and recom-
mencing another year of their individual lives, taught
them that they were becoming more and more respousible
beings-it was not mueh wonder that Ellen the whole
of that day should seem somewhat lcss clecrful than
usual. She had indeed had many sources of thankful-
ness and joy during the past year, but a henrt and
mind like hers could not recall its principal event with-
out a return of sorrow. Mrs. IInmilton wonld not
notice her now unusual sadness until the evening, when
perceiving her standing engrossed in thought beside
one of tle widely-opcned windows, ear which Caroline
was watering some lovely flowers on thc terrace, she
gently approached her, and, putting her arm round her,
said, fondly-
 You have thought quite seriously and quite long
enough for to-day, my dear Eilen; I must not have any
more such very silent meditations. hat there is some-
thing to regret in the retrospect of thc last year, I
acknowledge, but you must not let it poison all the
sources of thankfulness which it brings likewise.''
 It was not of my past conduct, I was tlhinking at
this moment, Aunt Lmmncline-it was-'
 What, love? tell me withont eserve,''

hat have you not done to gie me bnek not merels

 Do you remember the fable of the lion and the

Hnmilton, more affected than she chose to betray,
thongh she drew her niece closoer to her, and kissed
her fondly. `I hope I shall nerer be caught in a net,
nor exposed to such horrors and danger as poor Iadame
de leury in the French Reolution; but for all thut,
and unlikely as it sccms now, my dcar child, ou may
have many an opportunity to return all that you so
gratefully fecl yrou owe me. Do not let any such tlought
worry you; but bcliee me, when I nssure you that nflec-
tion and confidcnce are the only return I require, united,
nas they are in you, with such an earnest desire, nnd
such persevcring efiorts to become all our best friends

She wns interrupted by the entrance of Emmeline,
with a small parcel in her hand.

 Namna, this has just arrisred from lxeter for you;
with an apologising mcssage from Mlr. lennet, saying
it should have bcen here last night, as he promised, but
he could not get the anrticles from Iondon in time.
I am so ery curious as to what it possibly can be, that
I vould bring it to you myself.''
Any othcr time I wonld punish your constant
euriosity, Lmelino, by refusing to gratify it. I cnn-
not do so now, however, for I shonld punish mysclf as
ell. I id want it most particularly this morning
but I am glal it was not delayecd till the day was quitc
over. Your Uncle and I did not forget your birthday,
my denr Ellcn, though it seemcd so.'' And opening
thc parcel as she spoke, a very pretty jewel-case appeared,
containing tke watch, cross, and all the other trinkets
Ellen had placcdt in MIrs. Lnngford's hands, and neer
had had the conrage to inquire for, and the few her
aunt had kept for her, but so prettily arrnged and
beautifully buruished, that she would scarcely have
known thcm again.
 Did yon never feel any curiosity as to the fate of
yonr triukets, my love, that you have never askced
about them?''
I knew they werc in better hands than my own,''
replied kllen, with a quiscring lip. I elte 1 had no
further ight to them, after attempting to part with

:I low there arc some ery painful associations
connected with these trinkets, my dear Ellcn, and,
therefore, I onld not return tlcm to your own care,
till I could add t(o them n birthlay-gift,''-and, lifting the
upper tray, she took out a gold chain, and a pair of

the sad memories of the one may be forgotten in the
pleasant thoughts of the othcr. I have only one con-
dition to make,'' she added, in an earnest lower tone, as
lillen tried to speak her tlanks, but could only cling to
her aunt's neek, and weep. If eer again you are
tempted to dispose of tlem, dearest, promise mc to

ing them to me, for my valuation first.''
Yon shall be put into fetters at once, Ellen,'' said
Emmeline, joyously, as her cousin gase the required
pomise, so eagely, that it was evident, she felt how
much security dwelt in it.  Mnmma, makc her put
them ou; I waut to see if she looks as interesting as
Zenobia did in her golden chains.''
 I think you mnight fiud aprettier sinile, Emmeline,''
replied Mrs. IIamilton, smiling, as she granted her
request, by tlrowing the chain round Ellen's neek, and
fastening the bracclets on her wrists.
So I cnn, and so I ll,'' repliel the lively girl,
altering, without the smallest hesitation, the lines to suit
her fancy-
For thee, rash girl, no snppliant sues;
For thee may vengeance claim her nes;
Who, nurturcd underueath our sile,
Repaid our cares with treacherous wile.
Dishonouring ths thy loal name,
Fetters aml warders tou ust claim.
The chin of gold was quick unstrg,
Its links on that fair ncck teere flung;
Then geutly drew the glittering bnnl.
And laid the clasp on llen's hand,'
