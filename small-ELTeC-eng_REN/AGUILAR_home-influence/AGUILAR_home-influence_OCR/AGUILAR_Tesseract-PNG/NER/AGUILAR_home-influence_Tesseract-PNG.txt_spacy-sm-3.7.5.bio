perhaps O

after O

she O
quite O
started O
when O
a O

“ O

promised O

all O

there O
was O
a O
quivering O
on O
her O

lip O
, O
|
| O
a O
deadly O
paleness O
on O

that O

to O
the O
heart O

the O

Mary B-PERSON

Still O
Mrs. O

did O
not O

speak O
till O
her O
husband O
left O
the O

  O
but O
then O
, O
as O
Alfred B-ORG

| O
was O
about O
to O
follow O
him O
, O
she O
caught O
hold O
of O

implored O
him O

with O
such O
a O

, O
almost O
frightened O
by O
an O
emotion O
which O
in O

his O
gentle O
mother O
he O
had O
scarcely O
ever O
seen O
, O
and O
suddenly O
|
| O
remembering O
that O
he O
had O
lately O
been O
indeed O
most O
unkind O

and O
neglectful O
to O
her O
, O
he O
threw O
his O
arms O
round O
her O
neck O
, O
|
| O
and O
promised O
with O
tears O
, O
that O
if O
it O
gave O
her O
so O
much O
pain O
, O
|
| O
he O
would O
not O

and O

, O
whenever O

Mrs. O

neither O

the O

that O
poor O

Mr. O

“ O
What O

” O
she O

the O

The O

Now O

more O

she O

was O
not O

unjust O

harsh O
as O
poor O
Ellen B-PERSON

her O

, O
as O
he O
said O

it O
was O
of O
no O

and O
she O
would O
soon O

Mrs. O

adopted O
his O

took O
no O

Mrs. O

told O
at O

without O
the O
power O

a O

word O
. O
Caroline B-PERSON
was O
surprised O
, O
for O
his O
return O
seemed O
to O
|

her O
only O
a O
cause O
of O
rejoicing O
  O
— O
she O
had O

him O

now O

she O
had O
hardly O
strength O

her O
pure O

She O
wished O
Ellen B-PERSON
to O
be O
constantly O
in O
Edward B-PERSON

presence O
, O
that O

not O

able O

evade O
the O
impulse O

, O
which O
the O
sight O
of O
such O
