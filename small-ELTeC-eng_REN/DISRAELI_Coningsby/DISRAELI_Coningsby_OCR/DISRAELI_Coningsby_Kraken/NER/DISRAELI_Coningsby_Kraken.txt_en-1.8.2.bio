a O
very O
fair O
state O
of O

One S-CARDINAL
thing O
Rigby S-PERSON
was O
resolved O
on O
: O
Gay S-PERSON
should O
never O

That O

Rigby S-PERSON
kept O
that O
social O
monopoly O
distinctively O
to O
mark O
the O
relation O
that O
subsisted O
between O
them O
s O
patron O
and O
client O
. O
It O
was O
something O
to O
swagger O
about O
when O
they O
were O
together O
after O
their O
second S-ORDINAL
bottle O
of O

. O
Rigby S-PERSON
kept O
his O
resolution O
for O
some B-DATE
years E-DATE
which O
the O
frequent O
and O
prolonged O
absence O
of O
the O
Marquess S-PERSON
rendered O
not O

Madame O

some O

his O

only O
for O

his O
firm O
resolution O
began O

the O

himself O

yet O
, O
as O
Mr. O

immediately O
perceived O

the O

was O
a O
very O

one O

The O

281 S-CARDINAL
The O
next O
impression O
on O
his O
mind O
was O
un- O
doubtedly O
a O
natural O
and O
reasonable O
speculation O
on O
the O
effect O
of O
this O
bereavement O
on O
his O
for- O
tunes O
. O
Lord O
Monmouth S-PERSON
had O
more O
than O
once O
assured O
Coningsby S-PERSON
that O
he O
had O
provided O
for O
him O
as O
became O
a O
near O
relative O
to O
whom O
he O
was O
attached O

and O
in O
a O
manner O
which O
ought O
to O
satisfy O

considerable O

usually O
ac- O
corded O
to O
the O
eldest O
sons O
of O
wealthy O
peers O
, O
might O
justify O
him O
in O
estimating O
his O
future O
patrimony O
as O
extremely O
ample O
. O
He O
was O
aware O
indeed O
that O
at O
a O
subsequent O
period O
, O
his O
grandfather O
had O
pro- O
jected O
for O
him O
fortunes O
of O
a O
still O
more O
elevated O
character O
. O
He O
looked O
to O
Coningsby S-PERSON
as O
the O
future O
representative O
of O
an O
ancient O
Barony S-ORG
, O
and O
had O
been O
purchasing O
territory O
with O
the O
view O
of O
supporting O

title O
. O
But O
Coningsby S-PERSON
did O
not O
by O
any O
means O
firmly O
reckon O
on O
these O
views O
being O
realized O
. O
He O
had O
a O
suspicion O
that O
in O

at O

with O
his O

for O

it O
was O
his O
firm O

whether O

the O

This O

The O

The O

not O

In O

Here O

When O

his O

rose O

Coningsby S-PERSON

He O
found O
a O

from O

who O
had O

He O
set O
off O

to O

left O
at O

a O
rapid O
narrative O
of O
what O

Coningsby S-PERSON
did O
not O
sleep O
a O

that O
night O
, O

yet O
when O
he O
rose O
early O
felt O
fresh O
enough O
for O
any O

however O
difficult O

He O
felt O
as O

an O
event O

oceurred O
which O
seemed O
to O
restore O
all O

He O
dared O
not O
contemplate O
the O
ultimate O
result O
of O
all O
these O
wonderful O
changes O

Enough O
for O
him O
that O
when O
all O

dark O

he O
was O
about O

His O

learned O
some O

thing O
of O

Lady O

conferred O

was O
not O
surprised O
at O
the O
goodness O

she O
sympathized O

Sir O

never O

Mr. O

made O
in- O

about O

took O
an O

, O
like O
