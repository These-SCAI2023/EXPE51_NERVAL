very O
much O
fear O

a O
very O

because O
you O
have O
not O

heard O
from O
me O
before O
  O
but O
I O
was O
in O
hopes O

that O
I O
might O
get O
out O
and O
say O
to O
you O
what O
I O

feel O
  O
but O
whether O
I O
speak O

write O
, O
it O
is O
quite O

impossible O

I O
never O

you O
never O

I O

in O
extracting O

exciting O

He O
began O

The O
young O

it O
with O

“ O

The O

to O
perform O

with O
a O
certain O
degree O
of O
desperate O
determination O

She O
looked O
at O
a O

then O
at O
Coningsby B-GPE
, O
|
| O
and O
murmured O
something O
which O
he O
understood O
. O
|
| O
Sometimes O
she O
informed O
herself O
of O
his O

in O
more O
detail O
, O
by O
the O

of O
her O

, O
whom O
she O
treated O
as O
a O

of O

  O

in O
this O

: O

” O
Coningsby O

always O

a O

without O
the O

he O

did O
not O

of O
taking O
a O

her O

induced O
the O

And O
yet O
|

when O
she O
had O

seen O
him O

she O
had O
addressed O

him O
even O
with O

What O
could O
it O
be O

He O

Ir B-PERSON
appeared O
to O
Coningsby O
in O
his O
way O
to O
his O
|
| O
room O
, O
that O
the O
castle O
was O
in O
a O
state O
of O
great O
|
| O
excitement O
  O
everywhere O
bustle O
, O
preparation O
, O
|
| O
moving O
to O
and O
fro B-ORG
, O
ascending O
and O
descending O
|
| O
of O
stairs O
, O
servants O
in O
every O
corner O
  O
orders O
bound- O
|
| O
lessly O
given O
, O
rapidly O
obeyed O
  O
many O
desires O
, O
equal O
|
| O
gratification O
. O
All O
this O
made O
him O
rather O
nervous O
. O
|
| O
It O
was O
quite O
unlike O
Beaumanoir B-PERSON
. O
That O
also O
was O
|
| O
a O
palace O
, O
but O
it O
was O
a O
home O
. O
This O
, O
though O
it O
|
| O
should O
be O
one O
to O
him O
, O
seemed O
to O
have O
nothing O
|
| O
of O
that O
character O
. O
Of O
all O
mysteries O
the O
social O
|
| O
mysteries O
are O
the O
most O
appalling O
. O
Going O
to O
an O
|
| O
assembly O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
is O
more O
alarming O
|
| O
than O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
battle O
. O
Coningsby O
had O
never O
before O
|
| O
been O
in O
a O
great O
house O
full O
of O
company O
. O
It O
|

| O
CONINGSBY O
. O
61 B-CARDINAL
|

| O
seemed O
an O
overwhelming O
affair O
. O
The O
sight O
of O
|
| O
the O
servants O
bewildered O
him O
  O
how O
then O
was O
he O
|
| O
to O
encounter O
their O
masters O
? O
|

| O
That O
however O
he O
must O
do O
in O
a O
moment O
. O
|
| O
A O
groom O
of O
the O
chambers O
indicates O
the O
way O
to O
|
| O
him O
, O
as O
he O
proceeds O
with O
a O
hesitating O
yet O
hurried O
|
| O
step O
through O
several O
ante O
- O
chambers O
and O
drawing- O

| O
rooms O
  O
then O
doors O
are O
suddenly O
thrown O
open O
, O
|
| O
and O
he O
is O
ushered O
into O
the O
largest O
and O
most O
|
| O
sumptuous O
saloon O
that O
he O
had O
ever O
entered O
. O
It O
|
| O
was O
full O
of O
ladies O
and O
gentlemen O
. O
Coningsby O
|
| O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
in O
his O
life O
was O
at O
a O
great O
party O
. O
|
| O
His O
immediate O
emotion O
was O
to O
sink O
into O
the O
|
| O
earth O
, O
but O
perceiving O
that O
no O
one O
even O
noticed O
|
| O
him O
, O
and O
that O
not O
an O
eye O
had O
been O
attracted O
to O
|
| O
his O
entrance O
, O
he O
regained O
his O
breath O
and O
in O
|
| O
some O
degree O
his O
composure O
, O
and O
standing O
aside O
, O
|
| O
endeavoured O
to O
make O
himself O
as O
well O
as O
he O
could O
|
| O
master O
of O
the O
land O
. O
|

| O
Not O
a O
human O
being O
that O
he O
had O
ever O
seen O
|
| O
before O
! O
The O
circumstance O
of O
not O
being O
noticed O
|

which O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
since O
he O
had O
felt O
as O
a O
|
| O
relief O
, O
became O
now O
a O
cause O
of O
annoyance O
. O
It O
|
| O
seemed O
that O
he O
was O
the O
only O
person O
standing O
alone O

62 O
CONINGSBY O

| O
whom O
no O
one O
was O
addressing O
. O
He O
felt O
renewed O
|
| O
and O
aggravated O
embarrassment O
, O
and O
fancied O
, O
|
| O
perhaps O
was O
conscious O
, O
that O
he O
was O
blushing O
. O
|
| O
At O
length O
his O
ear O
caught O
the O
voice O
of O
Mr. O
Rigby B-PERSON
. O
|
| O
The O
speaker O
was O
not O
visible O
  O
he O
was O
at O
a O
|
| O
distance O
surrounded O
by O
a O
wondering O
group O
|
| O
whom O
he O
was O
severally O
and O
collectively O
con- O
|
| O
tradicting O
, O
but O
Coningsby B-PERSON
could O
not O
mis- O
|
| O
take O
those O
harsh O
, O
arrogant O
tones O
. O
He O
was O
not O
|
| O
sorry O
indeed O
that O
Mr. O
Rigby B-PERSON
did O
not O
observe O
|
| O
him O
. O
Coningsby O
never O
loved O
him O
particularly O
, O
|
| O
which O
was O
rather O
ungrateful O
, O
for O
he O
was O
a O
|
| O
person O
who O
had O
been O
kind O
, O
and O
on O
the O
whole O
, O
|
| O
serviceable O
to O
him O
, O
but O
Coningsby B-PERSON
writhed O
, O
and O
|
| O
especially O
as O
he O
grew O
older O
, O
under O
Mr. O
Rigby B-PERSON
’s O
|
| O
patronising O
air O
and O
paternal O
tone O
. O
Even O
in O
old B-DATE

though O
attentive O
, O
Coningsby B-PERSON
had O
never O

found O
him O
affectionate O

Mr. O
Rigby B-PERSON
would O
tell O
him O

what O
to O
do O

but O
never O
asked O
him O
what O
he O
|
| O
wished O
to O
do O

see O
. O
It O
seemed O
to O
Coningsby O

| O
that O
it O
was O
always O
contrived O
that O
he O

CHAPTER O
I. O
|

| O
An O
University O
life O
did O
not O
bring O
to O
Coningsby O
|
| O
that O
feeling O
of O
emancipation O
usually O
experienced O
|
| O
by O
freshmen O
. O
The O
contrast O
between O
school O
|
| O
and O
college O
life O
is O
perhaps O
under O
any O
circum- O
|
| O
stances O
less O
striking O
to O
the O
Etonian B-NORP
than O
to O
|
| O
others O
: O
he O
has O
been O
prepared O
for O
becoming O
his O
|
| O
own O
master O
by O
the O
liberty O
so O
wisely O
entrusted O
to O
|
| O
him O
in O
his O
boyhood O
, O
and O
which O
is O
in O
general O
so O
|
| O
discreetly O
exercised O
. O
But O
there O
were O
also O
other O
|
| O
reasons O
why O
Coningsby B-PERSON
should O
have O
been O
less O
|
| O
impressed O
with O
the O
novelty O
of O
his O
life O
, O
and O
have O

| O
encountered O
less O
temptations O
than O
commonly O

met O
with O
in O
the O
new O
existence O
which O
an O

In O
the O
interval O
, O

which O
had O
elapsed O
between O
quitting O
Eton B-PERSON
and O

| O
going O
to O
Cambridge B-GPE
, O
brief O
as O
the O
period O
may O
|
| O
comparatively O
appear O
, O
Coningsby B-PERSON
had O
seen O
much O

of O
the O
world O

may O
not O

, O
at O
the O
first B-ORDINAL

, O
a O
course O
of O

time O
which O
can O
very O
materially O
influence O
the O

time O
must O

by O
sensations O
, O
by O

| O
thought O
. O
Coningsby O
had O
felt O
a O
good O
deal O
, O
re- O

flected O
more O
. O
He O
had O
encountered O
a O
great O

number O
of O
human O
beings O
, O
offering O
a O
vast O
variety O
|
| O
of O
character O
for O
his O
observation O
. O
It O
was O
not O
|
| O
merely O
manners O
, O
but O
even O
the O
intellectual O
and O
|
| O
moral O
development O
of O
the O
human O
mind O
, O
which O
|
| O
in O
a O
great O
degree O
unconsciously O
to O
himself O
had O
|
| O
been O
submitted O
to O
his O
study O
and O
his O
scrutiny O
. O
|
| O
New O
trains O
of O
ideas O
had O
been O
opened O
to O
him O
  O

mind O
was O
teeming O
with O
suggestions O
. O
The O
ho- O

| O
rizon O
of O
his O
intelligence O
had O
insensibly O
expanded O
. O

He O
perceived O
that O
there O
were O
other O
opinions O

The O
depths O

stirred O

He O
was O
a O

He O
distinguished O
three B-CARDINAL

had O
greatly O
influenced O

doubtless O
of O

Yet O
unquestionably O
these O
were O
the O

Then O
she O
fell O
into O
a O

vowed O

only O

the O

feeling O
that O

now O
, O
his O

smote O

him O
for O
his O

, O
excusable O

it O
really O
was O
. O

Any O

he O
would O
have O

the O
gentle O

He O
looked O
at O
her O
  O
she O
was O
pale O

agitated O
. O

Her O
step O
trembled O

still O
hastened O
on O

“ O
What O

inquired O

“ O

Coningsby B-PERSON

in O
a O

of O
great O

as O
he O
felt O
Lucretia B-PERSON

sinking O

he O

with O
unwonted O

He O

, O
but O
the O
accident O
to O
Lady B-PERSON
Monmouth I-PERSON
, O
|
| O
though O
, O
as O
it O
ultimately O
appeared O
, O
accompanied O
|
| O
by O
no O
very O
serious O
consequences O
, O
quite O
dissipated O
|
| O
this O
intention O
. O
It O
was O
impossible O
to O
quit O
them O
so O
|
| O
crudely O
, O
at O
such O
a O
moment O
. O
So O
he O
remained O

another B-DATE

Sidonia B-GPE

féte B-ORG
, O
which O
he O
particularly O
resolved O

not O
to O
attend O
. O
He O
felt O
it O
quite O
impossible O
that O
|
| O
he O
could O
again O
endure O
the O
sight O
of O
either O
Sidonia B-GPE

or O
Edith B-PERSON

He O
looked O
upon O
them O
as O
persons O
who O
|

CONINGSBY O

61 B-CARDINAL
|

had O
deeply O
injured O
him O
  O

they O
really O
were O

individuals O
who O
had O
treated O
him O
with O
invariable O
|
| O
kindness O
. O
But O
he O
felt O
their O
existence O
was O
a O
source O
|
| O
of O
mortification O
and O
misery O
to O
him O
. O
With O

To O

them O
was O
impossible O
  O
they O
met O

  O
and O
Sir O
Joseph B-PERSON
stopped O
, O
and O
im- O

mediately O
reminded O
him O
that O
it O
was O
three B-DATE

since O
they O

seen O
him O

that O
Edith B-ORG

she O

not O

And O
Coningsby B-PERSON
turned O
round O

walked O

an O

When O

always O

admired O

it O
was O
a O
sympathy O

which O
aspired O
only O
to O
soften O
sorrow O

not O

That O
happy O

equable O
gaiety O

to O

she O
was O
fitful O

That O

Not O

there O

And O
often O

The O

Lord O

for O
