TO O
HENRY O
HOPE O
. O
It O
is O
not O
because O
these O
volumes O
were O
conceived O
and O
partly O
executed O
amid O
the O
glades O
and O
galleries O
of O
the O
Deepdene S-PERSON
, O
that O
I O
have O
inscribed O
them O
with O
your O
name O
. O
Nor O
merely O
because O
I O
was O
desirous O
to O
avail O
myself O
of O
the O
most O
graceful O
privilege O
of O
an O
author O
, O
and O
dedicate O
my O
work O
to O
the O
friend O
, O
whose O
talents O
I O
have O
always O
appreciated O
and O
whose O
virtues O
I O
have O
ever O
admired O
. O
But O
because O
in O
these O
pages O
I O
have O
endeavoured O
to O
picture O
something O
of O
that O
development O
of O
the O
new O
and O
, O
as O
I O
believe O
, O
better O
mind O
of O
England S-GPE
, O
that O
has O
often O
been O
the O
subject O
of O
our O
converse O
and O
speculation O
. O
In O
these O
volumes O
you O
will O
find O
many O
a O
thought O
illustrated O
and O
many O
a O
principle O
attempted O
to O
be O
/ O
established O
that O
we O
have O
often O
together O
partially O
discussed O
and O
canvassed O
. O
Doubtless O
you O
may O
encounter O
some O
opinions O
with O
which O
you O
may O
not O
agree O
, O
and O
some O
conclusions O
the O
accuracy O
of O
which O
you O
may O
find O
cause O
to O
question O
. O
But O
if O
I O
have O
generally O
succeeded O
in O
my O
object O
: O
to O
scatter O
some O
suggestions O
that O
may O
tend O
to O
elevate O
the O
tone O
of O
public O
life O

the O
true O
character O

with O
the O
general O
appearance O

and O
that O

at O
this O
period O

symptoms O

being O
occupied O
for O
some O
public O

The O

this B-TIME

The O

the O

porter O
inscribed O
in O
a O

the O
name O
of O
every O
individual O
who O
entered O

The O
young O
gentleman O
we O
have O
mentioned O
found O
himself O
in O
a O
room O
which O
offered O
few O
resources O
for O
his O
amusement O
. O
A O
large O
table O
amply O
covered O
with O
writing O
materials O
, O
and O
a O
few O
chairs O
were O

sole O
furniture O
, O
except O
the O
grey O

that O
covered O
the O
floor O

and O
a O
muddy O
mezzotinto O
of O
the B-FAC
Duke I-FAC
of I-FAC

that O
adorned O
its O

. O
For O
some O
time O
, O
he O
remained O
with O
patient O
endurance O
planted O
against O
the O
wall O
, O
with O
his O
feet O
resting O
on O
the O
rail O
of O
his O
chair O

but O
at O
length O
in O
his O
shifting O
posture O
he O
gave O
evidence O
of O
his O
restlessness O
, O
rose O
from O
his O
seat O
, O
looked O
out O
of O
the O
window O
into O
/ O
a O
small O
side O
court O
of O
the O
house O
surrounded O
with O
dead O
walls O
, O
paced O
the O
room O
, O
took O
up O
the B-ORG
Court I-ORG
Guide E-ORG
, O
changed O
it O
for O
the B-ORG
London I-ORG
Directory E-ORG
, O
then O
wrote O
his O
name O
over O
several O
sheets O
of O
foolscap O
paper O
, O
drew O
various O
landscapes O
and O
faces O
of O
his O
friends O
| | O
and O
then O
, O
splitting O
up O
a O
pen O
or O
two S-CARDINAL
, O
delivered O
himself O
of O
a O
yawn O
, O
which O
seemed O
the O
climax O
of O
his O
weariness O
. O
And O
yet O
the O
youth's O
appearance O
did O
not O
betoken O
a O
character O
that O
, O
if O
the O
opportunity O
had O
offered O
, O
could O
not O
have O
found O
amusement O
and O
even O
instruction O
. O
His O
countenance O
, O
radiant O
with O
health O
and O
lustre O
of O
innocence O
, O
was O
at O
the O
same O
time O
thoughtful O
and O
resolute O
. O
The O
expression O
of O
his O
deep O
blue O
eye O
was O
serious O
. O
Without O
extreme O
regularity O
of O
features O
, O
the O
face O
was O
one O
that O
would O
never O
have O
passed O
unobserved O
. O
His O
short O
upper O
lip O
indicated O
a O
good O
breed O
| | O
and O
his O
chestnut O
curls O
clustered O
over O
his O
open O
brow O
, O
while O
his O
shirt O
collar O
thrown O
over O
his O
shoulders O
was O
unrestrained O
by O
handkerchief O
or O
ribbon O
. O
Add O
to O
this O
, O
a O
limber O
and O
graceful O
figure O
, O
which O
the O
jacket O
/ O
of O
his O
boyish O
dress O
exhibited O
to O
great O
advantage O
. O
Just O
as O
the O
youth O
, O
mounted O
on O
a O
chair O
, O
was O
adjusting O
the O
portrait O
of O
the O
Duke S-PERSON
which O
he O
had O
observed O
to O
be O
awry O
, O
the O
gentleman O
for O
whom O
he O
had O
been O
all O
this O
time O
waiting O
entered O
the O
room O
. O
" O
Floreat B-ORG
Etona E-ORG
! O
" O
hastily O
exclaimed O
the O
gentleman O
in O
a O
sharp O
voice O
, O
" O
you O
are O
setting O
the O
Duke O
to O
rights O
. O
I O
have O
left O
you O
a O
long O
time O
a O
prisoner O
| | O
but O
I O
found O
them O
so O
busy O
here O
, O
that O
I O
myself O
made O
my O
escape O
with O
difficulty O
. O
" O
He O
who O
uttered O
these O
words O
was O
a O
man O
of O
middle O
size O
and O
age O
, O
originally O
in O
all O
probability O
of O
a O
spare O
habit O
, O
but O
now O
a O
little O
inclined O
to O
corpulency O
. O
Baldness O
perhaps O
contributed O
to O
the O
spiritual O
expression O
of O
a O
brow O
, O
which O
was O
however O
essentially O
intellectual O
, O
and O
gave O
some O
character O
of O
openness O
to O
a O
countenance O
which O
, O
though O
not O
ill O
- O
favoured O
, O
was O
unhappily O
stamped O
by O
a O
sinister O
character O
that O
was O
not O
to O
be O
mistaken O
. O
His O
manner O
was O
easy O
, O
but O
rather O
audacious O
/ O
than O
well O
- O
bred O
. O
Indeed O
, O
while O
a O
visage O
which O
might O
otherwise O
be O
described O
as O
handsome O
was O
spoilt O
by O
a O
dishonest O
glance O
, O
so O
a O
demeanour O
that O
was O
by O
no O
means O
deficient O
in O
self O
- O
possession O
and O
facility O
, O
was O
tainted O
by O
an O
innate O
vulgarity O
, O
which O
in O
the O
long O
run O
, O
though O
seldom O
, O
yet O
surely O
, O
developed O
itself O
. O
The O
youth O
had O
jumped O
off O
his O
chair O
on O
the O
entrance O
of O
the O
gentleman O
, O
and O
then O
taking O
up O
his O
hat O
, O
said O
: O
" O
Shall O
we O
go O
to O
grand O

said O
the O
gentleman O
, O
putting O
his O
arm O
within O
that O
of O
the O
youth O

they O
were O
just O

CHAPTER O
II O
. O
The O
political O
agitation O
which O
for O
a B-DATE
year I-DATE
and I-DATE
a I-DATE
half E-DATE
had O
shaken O
England S-GPE
to O
its O
centre O
, O
received O
if O
possible O
an O
increase O
to O
its O
intensity O
and O
virulence O
, O
when O
it O
was O
known O
in O
the B-DATE
early I-DATE
part I-DATE
of I-DATE
the I-DATE
month I-DATE
of I-DATE
May I-DATE
, I-DATE
1832 E-DATE
, O
that O
the O
Prime O
Minister O
had O
tendered O
his O
resignation O
to O
the O
King O
, O
which O
resignation O
had O
been O
graciously O
accepted O
. O
was O
the O
immediate O
cause O
of O
this O
startling O
event O
. O
The O
Lords S-ORG
had O
previously O
consented O
to O
the O
second S-ORDINAL
reading O
of O
the O
Bill S-PERSON
with O
the O
view O
of O
preventing O
that O
large O
increase O
of O
their O
numbers O
with O
which O
they O
had O
been O
long O
menaced O
| | O
rather O
indeed O
by O
mysterious O
rumours O
than O
by O
any O
official O
declaration O
| | O
but O
nevertheless O
in O
a O
manner O
which O
had O
carried O
conviction O
to O
no O
inconsiderable O
portion O
of O
the O
Opposition O
that O
the O
threat O
was O
not O
without O
foundation O
. O
During O
the O
progress O
of O
the O
Bill S-PERSON
through O
the B-FAC
Lower I-FAC
House E-FAC
, O
the O
journals O
which O
were O
looked O
upon O
as O
the O
organs O
of O
the O
ministry O
, O
had O
announced O
with O
unhesitating O
confidence O
, O
that O
Lord O
Grey S-PERSON
was O
armed O
with O
what O
was O
then O
called O
a O
carte O
blanche O
to O
create O
any O
number O
of O
peers O
necessary O
to O
insure O
its O
success O

statements O

this O
prevailing O
belief O

not O
connected O
with O
it O
by O
any O
official O
tie O
, O
had O
unequivocally O
stated O
in O
their O
places O
that O
the O
Sovereign S-ORG
had O
not O
resisted O
the O
advice O
of O
his O
counsellors O
to O
create O
peers O
, O
if O
such O
creation O
were O
required O
to O
carry O
into O
effect O
what O
was O
then O
styled O

measure O

" O
In O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
one E-CARDINAL

not O
exercise O
that O
power O

prompt O
energy O

might O
deserve O
impeachment O

these O
intimations O

made O
in O
the O

the O
sanction O

silence O

thus O
obtained O

affected O
rather O

forward O

there O
are O
some O
situations O

such O
for O

as O
entering O
the O
room O

when O
the O
prostration O

was O
to O
be O
formally O
received O
into O
the O

the O

at O

the O

it O
was O

stir O
up O

hand O
rested O
on O

Lord B-PERSON
Monmouth E-PERSON
was O
in O
height O
above O
the O
midde O
size O

somewhat O
portly O

corpulent O

strongly O

sagacity O
on O
the O
brow O

sensuality O
in O
the O
mouth O

jaw O

His O
head O
was O
bald O

there O
were O
remains O
of O
the O
rich O
brown O
locks O
on O

he O
once O
prided O
himself O

His O
large O
deep O
blue O
eye O
, O
madid O

yet O
piercing O
, O
showed O
that O
the O

brain O
were O
apportioned O
, O
half S-CARDINAL
to O
voluptuousness O

half S-CARDINAL
to O
common O
sense O

But O
his O
general O
mien O
was O
truly O
grand O

full O
of O
a O
natural O
nobility O

of O

no O

Lord O

not O

contrary O

costume O

exact O

even O
careful O

Rising O
as O
we O
have O
mentioned O
when O
his O
grandson O

leaning O
with O
his O
left O

his O
ivory O

made O
Coningsby S-PERSON

have O
bestowed O
on O

Then O
extending O
his O
right O
hand O
, O
which O
the O
boy O
tremblingly O
touched O
, O
Lord O

said O
: O
" O

do O
you O
like O

" O
This O
contrast O
to O
the O
reception O

he O
had O
imagined O

feared O

paralysed O
the O
reviving O
energies O

felt O
stupified O

looked O

aghast O

heard O
in O
his O
earliest O
boyhood O

unnoticed O
then O
, O
long O
since O
forgotten O

rose O

his O
ear O

this O
superb O

icy O

boy O
sank O

chair O

had O
been O
placed O
for O
him O

and O
leaning O
on O
the O
table O
burst O
into O
tears O

was O
tender O

hearted O

tender O
- O
hearted O

! O

decided O

mind O
that O
Coningsby S-PERSON
must O
be O
provided O
for O
in O
the O
Church S-ORG
, O
and O
looked O
at O
Mr. O
Rigby S-PERSON
, O
whose O
principal O
business O
it O
always O
was O
to O
disembarrass O
his O

disagreeable O
. O
Mr. O
Rigby S-PERSON
instantly O
came O
forward O

adroitly O
led O
the O
boy O
into O

closing O

. O
" O
My O
dear O
young O
friend O

" O
what O
is O
all O
this O

only O
answer O

" O
said O
Mr. O

" O
Lord O

never O

mother O

father O

" O
In O
the O
meantime O
Lord O
Monmouth S-PERSON
had O
decided O
on O
the O
fate O
of O
Coningsby S-PERSON

The O
Marquess S-PERSON
thought O
he O
could O
read O
characters O
by O
a O
glance O
, O
and O
in O
general O
he O
was O
very O
successful O

for O
his O
natural O
sagacity O
had O
been O
nurtured O
by O
great O

CHAPTER O
IV O
. O
" O
Come O
, O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Rigby S-PERSON
, O
when O
Coningsby S-PERSON
was O
somewhat O
composed O
, O
" O
come O
with O
me O
, O
and O
we O
will O
see O
the O
house O
. O
" O
So O
they O
descended O
once O
more O
the O
private O
staircase O
, O
and O
again O
entered O
the O
vestibule O
. O
tapestry O
and O
the O
gorgeous O
products O
of O
foreign O
looms O
| | O
filled O
with O
choice O
pictures O
and O
creations O
of O
curious O
art O
| | O
cabinets O
that O
sovereigns O
might O
envy O
, O
and O
colossal O
vases O
of O
malachite O
presented O
by O
Emperors S-PERSON
. O
Coningsby S-PERSON
alternately O
gazed O
up O
to O
ceilings O
glowing O
with O
colour O
and O
with O
gold O
, O
and O
down O
upon O
carpets O
bright O
with O
the O
fancies O
and O
vivid O
with O
the O
tints O
of O
Aubusson S-PERSON
and O
of O
Axminster S-GPE
. O
" O
This O
grandfather O
of O
mine O
is O
a O
great O
prince O
, O
" O
thought O
Coningsby S-PERSON
, O
as O
musing O
he O
stood O
before O
a O
portrait O
in O
which O
he O
recognised O
the O
features O
of O
the O
being O
from O
whom O
he O
had O
so O
recently O
and O
so O
strangely O
parted O
. O
There O
he O
stood O
, O
Philip B-PERSON
Augustus E-PERSON
, O
Marquess S-PERSON
of O
Monmouth S-GPE
, O
in O
his O
robes O
of O
estate O
, O
with O
his O
new O
coronet O
on O
a O
table O
near O
him O
, O
a O
despatch O
lying O
at O
hand O
that O
indicated O
the O
special O
mission O
of O
high O
ceremony O
of O
which O
he O
had O
been O
the O
illustrious O
envoy O
, O
and O
the O
garter O
beneath O
his O
knee O
. O
boy O
had O
now O
quite O
recovered O
himself O
. O
" O
Some O
luncheon O
will O
do O
you O
no O
harm O
after O
our O
drive O
, O
" O
and O
he O
opened O
the O
door O
of O
another O
apartment O
. O
It O
was O
a O
pretty O
room O
, O
adorned O
with O
a O
fine O
picture O
of O
the O
chase O
: O
at O
a O
round O
table O
in O
the O
centre O
sate O
two S-CARDINAL
ladies O
interested O
in O
the O
meal O
to O
which O
Rigby S-PERSON
had O
alluded O
. O
" O
Ah O
, O
Mr. O
Rigby S-PERSON
! O
" O
said O
the O
eldest O
, O
yet O
young O
and O
beautiful O
, O
and O
speaking O
, O
though O
with O
fluency O
, O
in O
a O
foreign O
accent O
, O
" O
come O
and O
tell O
me O
some O
news O
. O
Have O
you O
seen O
Milor S-PERSON
? O
" O
and O
then O
she O
threw O
a O
scrutinizing O
glance O
from O
a O
dark O
flashing O
eye O
at O
his O
companion O
. O
" O
Let O
me O
present O
to O
your O
Highness O
, O
" O
said O
Rigby S-PERSON
with O
an O
air O
of O
some O
ceremony O
, O
" O
Mr. O
Coningsby S-PERSON
. O
" O
" O
My O
dear O
young O
friend O
, O
" O
said O
the O
Lady S-PERSON
, O
extending O
her O
white O
hand O
with O
an O
air O
of O
joyous O
welcome O
, O
" O
this O
is O
Lucretia S-PERSON
, O
my O
daughter O
. O
We O
love O
you O
already O

Lord O
Monmouth S-PERSON
will O
be O
so O
charmed O
to O
see O
you O
. O
What O
beautiful O
eyes O
he O
has O
, O
Mr. O
Rigby S-PERSON
! O
Quite O
like O
Milor S-PERSON
. O
" O
The O
young O
lady O
, O
who O
was O
really O
more O
youthful O
than O
Coningsby S-PERSON
, O
but O
of O
a O
form O
and O
stature O
so O
developed O
, O
that O
she O
appeared O
almost O
a O
woman O
, O
bowed O
to O
the O
guest O
with O
some O
ceremony O
, O
and O
a O
faint O
sullen O
smile O
, O
and O
then O
proceeded O
with O
her O
chicken O
- O
pie O
. O
" O
You O
must O
be O
so O
hungry O
after O
your O
drive O
, O
" O
said O
the O
elder O
lady O
, O
placing O
Coningsby S-PERSON
at O
her O
side O
, O
and O
herself O
filling O
his O
plate O
. O
It O
was O
evident O
that O
he O
had O
made O
a O
favourable O
impression O
on O
her O
Highness O
, O
for O
ever O
and O
anon O
she O
put O
a O
truffle O
or O
some O
small O
delicacy O
in O
his O
plate O
, O
and O
insisted O
upon O
his O
taking O
some O
particular O
confectionary O
, O
because O
it O
was O
a O
favourite O
of O
her O
own O
. O
When O
she O
rose O
, O
she O
said O
: O
" O
In O
ten B-TIME

" O
There O

should O

" O
said O
Coningsby S-PERSON
. O
" O
Ah O
! O
" O
said O
the O
lady O
with O
the O
sweetest O
smile O
, O
" O
he O
is O
frank O

" O
The O
ladies O
bowed O

retired O

Mr. O
Rigby S-PERSON
returned O
to O
the O
Marquess S-PERSON
, O
and O
the O
groom O
of O
the O

Coningsby S-PERSON
to O
his O
room O

Lucretia S-PERSON
was O
the O

He O
was O
a O
man O
dissolute O

devoted O
to O
play O

and O
cared O
for O

his O

in O

yet O
perhaps O
the O
most O

In O
the O
protracted O
discussions O
to O
which O
this O
celebrated O
measure O
gave O
rise O
, O
nothing O
is O
more O
remarkable O
than O
the O
perplexities O
into O
which O
the O
speakers O
of O
both O

thrown O
, O
when O
they O
touch O
upon O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
representative O
principle O
. O
On O
one S-CARDINAL
hand O
it O
was O
maintained O
, O
that O
under O
the O
old O
system O
the O
people O
were O
virtually O
represented O

while O
on O
the O
other O
, O
it O
was O
triumphantly O
urged O
, O
that O
if O
the O
principle O
be O
conceded O
, O
the O
people O
should O
not O
be O
virtually O
, O
but O
actually O
represented O
. O
But O
who O
are O
the O
people O
? O
And O
where O
are O
you O
to O
draw O
a O
line O
? O
And O
why O
should O
there O
be O
any O
? O
It O
was O
urged O
that O
a O
contribution O
to O
the O
taxes O
was O
the O
constitutional O
qualification O
for O
the O
suffrage O
. O
But O
we O
have O
established O
a O
system O
of O
taxation O
in O
this O
country O
of O
so O
remarkable O
a O
nature O
, O
that O
the O
beggar O
who O
chews O
his O
quid O
as O
he O
sweeps O
a O
crossing O
, O
is O
contributing O
to O
the O
imposts O
. O
Is O
he O
to O
have O
a O
vote O
? O
He O
is O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
people O
, O
and O
he O
yields O
his O
quota O
to O
the O
public O
burthens O
. O
confounding O
conclusions O
, O
it O
is O
singular O
that O
no O
member O
of O
either O
house O
should O
have O
recurred O
to O
the O
original O
character O
of O
these O
popular O
assemblies O
, O
which O
have O
always O
prevailed O
among O
the O
northern O
nations O
. O
We O
still O
retain O
in O
the O
antique O
phraseology O
of O
our O
statutes O
, O
the O
term O
which O
might O
have O
beneficially O
guided O
a O
modern O
Reformer O
in O
his O
re-constructive O
labours O
. O
When O
the O
crowned O
Northman S-PERSON
consulted O
on O
the O
welfare O
of O
his O

, O
he O
assembled O

This I-ORG
Third I-ORG

so O

The B-FAC

In O
this O

the O

an O
arbitrary O

deep O

all O
felt O

its O

a O

Yet O
Millbank S-PERSON
was O
the O
very O
last O
boy O
in O
the O
school O
who O
would O
have O
had O
credit O
given O
him O
by O
his O
companions O
for O
profound O
and O
ardent O
feeling O

He O
was O
not O

indeed O

unpopular O

The O
favourite O
of O
the O
school O
like O
Coningsby S-PERSON

he O
could O
under O
no O
circumstances O
, O
ever O
have O
become O

nor O
was O
he O
qualified O
to O
obtain O
that O
general O
graciousness O
among O
the O
multitude O
, O
which O
the O
sweet O
disposition O
of O
Henry B-PERSON

the O
gay O
profusion O
of O
Buckhurst S-ORG
, O
acquired O
without O
an O
effort O
. O
Millbank S-ORG
was O
not O
blessed O
with O
the O
charm O
of O
manner O
. O
He O
seemed O
close O
and O
cold O

but O
he O
was O
courageous O
, O
just O
and O
inflexible O
| | O
never O
bullied O
, O
and O
to O
his O
utmost O
would O
prevent O
tyranny O
. O
The O
little O
boys O
looked O
up O
to O
him O
as O
to O
a O
stern O
protector O
. O
His O
word O
throughout O
the O
school O
too O
was O
a O
proverb O
: O
and O
truth O
ranks O
a O
great O
quality O
among O
boys O
. O
In O
a O
word O
, O
Millbank S-PERSON

respected O

among O

he O
lived O
, O
and O
schoolboys O

character O
more O
nicely O
than O
men O
suppose O
. O
his O
pride O
recoiled O
from O
gaining O
by O
any O
indirect O
means O
, O
an O
intimacy O
which O
to O
have O
obtained O
in O
a O
plain O
and O
express O
manner O
, O
would O
have O
deeply O
gratified O
him O
. O
However O
the O
urgent O
invitation O
of O
Buckhurst S-PERSON
and O
Henry B-PERSON
Sydney E-PERSON
, O
and O
the O
fear O
that O
a O
persistance O
in O
refusal O
might O
be O
misinterpreted O
into O
churlishness O
, O
had O
at O
length O
brought O
Millbank S-ORG
to O
their O
breakfast O
- O
mess O
, O
though O
when O
he O
accepted O
their O
invitation O

he O
did O
not O
apprehend O
that O
Coningsby S-PERSON
would O
have O
been O
present O

adjudged O
the O
palm O

Thus O
public O
opinion O
is O
formed O

Some O
too O
might O
be O
seen O
with O
their O
books O

just O
at O
this O
moment O

an O
increased O
stir O

long O
walk O

circle O

there O
appeared O
Henry B-PERSON

There O
was O
a O
dead O
silence O

It O
was O
impossible O
that O

The O
air O
and O
countenance O
of O
Sydney S-GPE

Buckhurst S-GPE
were O
rather O
excited O
than O
mournful O

alarmed O

needed O
no O

Buckhurst S-PERSON

the O
most O
energetic O
of O

Henry B-PERSON

indeed O

pale O

nervous O

his O
companion O
, O
flushed O

resolute O
, O
knew O
exactly O
how O
to O
hit O
a O
popular O
assembly O

at O
once O
came O
to O
the O
point O

Then O
, O
turning O
to O
Sedgwick S-PERSON

in O
an O
under O
tone O
Buckhurst S-PERSON
added O
: O

It O
is O
all O
right O

In O
a B-TIME

Sedgwick S-PERSON

Herbert S-PERSON

one S-CARDINAL

two S-CARDINAL

turned O
into O

fields O

undisturbed O

unnoticed O
by O

very O
fresh O

changed O
his O
mind O

should O
go O

bathe O

too O

So O
he O
left O
us O

He O
had O
scarcely O
got O
to O
the O
pool O
when O
he O
heard O
a O
cry O

There O
was O
a O
fellow O
drowning O

He O
threw O
off O
his O
clothes O

was O
in O

The O
fact O

this O
, O
Millbank S-ORG
had O
plunged O
in O
the O
pool O

found O
himself O
in O
some O
eddies O
, O
caused O
by O
the O
meeting O
of O
two S-CARDINAL
currents O

He O
called O
out O
to O
Vere S-PERSON
not O
to O
come O

tried O
to O
swim O
off O

he O
was O
beat O
, O
and O
seeing O
he O
was O
in O
danger O
, O
Vere S-PERSON
jumped O
in O
. O
But O
the O
stream O
was O
so O
strong O
from O
the O
great O
fall O
of O
water O
from O
the O
lasher O
above O

exhausted O

nearly O
sank O
himself O

he O
just O
saved O
himself O

Millbank S-ORG
sank O

himself O

shouts O

arrived O

lifeless O

The B-ORG

unconsciously O
approximated O

may O
be O
sometimes O
imperative O

But O
these O

took O
expediency O

gradually O
formed O
a O
public O

that O
would O

permitted O

organize O

a O
broad O

nobly O
effected O

a O

in O
an O

They O
might O
have O
concluded O
a O
satisfactory O
re-construction O
of O
the O
third S-ORDINAL

, O
without O
producing O
that O
convulsion O

from O
its O
violent O

our O
social O

still O
vibrates O

Lastly O

they O
might O

adjusted O
the O

our O
national O

their O

Lord O

Booby E-PERSON
was O
giving O
me O
last B-TIME

quite O
a O
glowing O
report O
of O
Mr. O
Tadpole's S-PERSON
prospects O

We O
were O
all O

Percy S-PERSON

" O
" O
My O

past O
there O
will O
not O
be O
a O
county O
in O
England S-GPE

Why O
should O
there O
be O
? O
If O
boroughs O
are O
to O
be O
disfranchised O
, O
why O
should O
not O
counties O
be O
destroyed O
? O
" O
At O
this O
moment O
the O
Duke S-PERSON
entered O
, O
apparently O
agitated O
. O
He O
bowed O
to O
his O
guests O

apologized O
for O
his O
unusual O
absence O
. O
" O
The O
truth O
is O
, O
" O
he O
continued O
, O
" O
I O
have O
just O
received O
a O
very O

as O
Sir O
William B-PERSON

says O
, O
could O
not O
have O
produced O
a O
greater O
sensation O
. O
The O
business O
of O
the O
repast O
ceased O
in O
a O
moment O
. O
The O
knives O
and O

were O
suddenly O
silent O

All O
was O
still O

" O
It O
is O
an O
immense O
event O

" O
It O

impossible O

Taper S-PERSON

" O
Now O
is O
the O
time O
for O
an O
amendment O
on O
the O

, O
" O
said O
Fitz B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Booby E-PERSON
. O
" O
There O
are O
two S-CARDINAL
reasons O
which O
convince O
me O
that O
Lord O

said O
Mr. O

" O
I O
fear O
there O

said O
the O
Duke S-PERSON
, O
shaking O
his O
head O
. O
" O
Lord O
Althorp S-PERSON
was O
the O
only O
man O

Lord O

" O
On O
the O

right O

my O

I O

no O

you O

a O
radical O

they O
will O
be O
stronger O

ever O

" O
" O
Do O
you O
think O
they O
can O
get O
the O
steam O
up O
again O

Taper S-PERSON
, O
musingly O
. O
" O
They O
will O
bid O
high O

" O
replied O
Tadpole S-PERSON
. O
" O
Nothing O
could O
be O
more O
unfortunate O

going O

quietly O

Shabbyton S-PERSON

mournfully O
exclaimed O
Taper S-PERSON
. O
" O
Another O

I O
could O

the O

pardon O

" O
This O
announcement O
silenced O
even O
Mr. O
Rigby S-PERSON
, O
and O
the O
conversation O
now O
entirely O
merged O
in O
speculations O
on O
what O
would O
occur O
. O
Numerous O
were O
the O
conjectures O
hazarded O
, O
but O
the O
prevailing O
impression O
was O
, O
that O
this O
unforeseen O
event O
might O
embarrass O
those O
secret O
expectations O
of O
Court S-ORG
succour O
in O
which O
a O
certain O
section O
of O
the O
party O
had O
for O
some O
time O
reason O
to O
indulge O
. O
change O
might O
be O
visibly O
observed O
in O
the O
tone O
of O
the O
party O
at O
Beaumanoir S-ORG
. O
They O
became O
silent O
, O
moody O
, O
and O
restless O
. O
There O
seemed O
a O
general O
, O
though O
not O
avowed O
, O
conviction O
that O
a O
crisis O
of O
some O
kind O
or O
other O
was O
at O
hand O
. O
The O
post O
too O
brought O
letters O
every O
day O
from O
town O
teeming O
with O
fanciful O
speculations O
, O
and O
occasionally O
mysterious O
hopes O
. O
" O
I O
kept O
this O
cover O
for O
Peel S-PERSON

said O
the O
Duke S-PERSON
pensively O

it O

consequence O

Sometimes O
the O
green O
earth O

thickly O
studded O

stood O
at O

He O
slightly O

His O
was O
a O

loved O

in O
an O
age O
of O
infidelity O

heart O
assured O
him O
that O
a O
want O

a O
want O

nature O

But O
his O
vigorous O
intellect O
could O
not O
take O
refuge O
in O
that O
maudlin O
substitute O
for O
belief O

consists O
in O
a O
patronage O
of O

theories O

He O
needed O
that O
deep O

enduring O
conviction O

the O
heart O

the O
intellect O
, O
feeling O
and O
reason O
united O
, O
can O
alone O
supply O

He O
asked O
himself O
why O
governments O
were O
hated O

despised O
? O
Why O

But O
Mr. O

was O
not O
a O
man O
who O
ever O
confessed O
himself O
at O
fault O

He O
caught O
up O
something O
of O
the O
subject O
as O
our O
young O
friend O
proceeded O
, O
and O
was O
perfectly O
prepared O

take O
the O

common O

spirits O

Lady O
Everingham S-PERSON
thoroughly O
understood O
the O
art O
of O
conversation O
, O
which O
indeed O
consists O
of O
the O
exercise O
of O
two S-CARDINAL

the O
habit O
of O
communicating O
, O
and O
the O
habit O
of O
listening O

The O
union O
is O
rather O
rare O
, O

irresistible O

, O
by O
the O

she O
lost O
no O
opportunity O
of O
displaying O

Then O
there O
was O
music O
. O
Lady O
Theresa S-PERSON
sung O
like O
a O
seraph O
: O
a O
rich O
voice O
, O
a O
grand O

. O
And O
her O

support O
her O
with O
grace O

sweetness O

And O
they O
did O
not O
sing O
too O
much O
. O
The O
Duke S-ORG
took O
up O
a O
review O
, O
and O
looked O
at O
Rigby's S-PERSON
last O
slashing O
article O
. O
The O
country O
seemed O
ruined O
, O
but O
it O
appeared O
that O
the O
Whigs S-NORP
were O
still O
worse O
off O
than O
the O
Tories S-NORP
. O
The O
assassins O
had O
committed O
suicide O
. O
This O
poetical O
justice O
is O
pleasing O
. O
Lord O
Everingham S-PERSON
lounging O
in O
an O
easy O

perused O
with O
great O
satisfaction O
his O

contained O
a O

the O

Lord O

sate O
up O
talking O
over O

CHAPTER O
IV O
. O
the O
peculiar O
and O
most O
picturesque O
feature O
of O
this O
splendid O
residence O
. O
The O
wooded O
heights O
that O
formed O
the O
valley O
, O
were O
not O
, O
as O
they O
first S-ORDINAL
appeared O
, O
a O
range O
of O
hills O
. O
Their O
crest O
was O
only O
the O
abrupt O
termination O
of O
a O
vast O
and O
enclosed O
table O
- O
land O
, O
abounding O
in O
all O
the O
qualities O
of O
the O
ancient O
chase O
| | O
turf O
and O
trees O
, O
a O
wilderness O
of O
underwood O
, O
and O
a O
vast O
spread O
of O
gorse O
and O
fern O
. O
The O
deer O
, O
that O
abounded O
, O
lived O
here O
in O
a O
world O
as O
savage O
as O
themselves O
: O
trooping O
down O
in O
the O
evening O
to O
the O
river O
. O
Some O
of O
them O
indeed O
were O
ever O
in O
sight O
of O
those O
who O
were O
in O
the O
valley O
, O
and O
you O
might O
often O
observe O
various O
groups O
clustered O
on O
the O
green O
heights O
above O
the O
mansion O
, O
the O
effect O
of O
which O
was O
most O
inspiriting O
and O
graceful O
. O
Sometimes O
in O
the O
twilight O
, O
a O
solitary O
form O
, O
magnified O
by O
the O
illusive O
hour O
, O
might O
be O
seen O
standing O
on O
the O
brink O
of O
the O
steep O
, O
large O
and O
black O
against O
the O
clear O
sky O
. O
which O
gave O
to O
the O
dwellers O
in O
it O
a O
view O
over O
an O
extensive O
and O
richly O
cultivated O
country O
. O
It O
was O
through O
this O
district O
that O
the O
party O
from O
Beaumanoir S-GPE
had O
pursued O
their O
way O
. O
The O
first S-ORDINAL
glance O
at O
the O
building O
, O
its O
striking O
situation O
, O
its O
beautiful O
form O
, O
its O
brilliant O
colour O
, O
its O
great O
extent O
, O
a O
gathering O
as O
it O
seemed O
of O
galleries O
, O
halls O
, O
and O
chapels O
, O
mullioned O
windows O
, O
portals O
of O
clustered O
columns O
, O
and O
groups O
of O
airy O
pinnacles O
and O
fretwork O
spires O
, O
called O
forth O
a O
general O
cry O
of O
wonder O
and O
praise O
. O
The O
ride O
from O
Beaumanoir S-GPE
had O
been O
delightful O

the O
breath O
of O
summer O
in O
every O
breeze O
, O
the O
light O
of O
summer O
on O
every O
tree O
. O
The O
gay O
laugh O
of O
Lady B-PERSON
Everingham E-PERSON
rang O
frequently O
in O
the O
air O

often O
were O
her O
sunny O
eyes O
directed O
to O
Coningsby S-PERSON
, O
as O
she O
called O
his O
attention O
to O
some O
fair O
object O
or O
some O
pretty O
effect O

She O
played O
the O
hostess O
of O

introduced O
him O
to O
all O

gently O

arrived O

the O
peacocks O

who O
were O
sunning O
themselves O
on O
the O
turrets O

expanded O
their O
plumage O
to O
welcome O

the O

an O

then O
they O
present O
it O
at O
the O

certificate O
explains O

He O
was O
deeply O
interested O

he O
watched O
the O
magic O

she O
melted O

Without O

there O
was O
in O
her O

most O
winning O

sometimes O
a O
burst O
of O
energy O

a O
trait O
of O
decision O
, O
which O
strikingly O
contrasted O
with O
the O
somewhat O

character O

away O

sometimes O
wished O
nothing O

disturb O

Apart O
from O

, O
he O
frequently O
felt O
himself O
pensive O

vaguely O
disquieted O

Even O
the O
society O

Henry B-PERSON
Sydney E-PERSON

Eustace B-PERSON
Lyle E-PERSON
, O
much O
as O
under O
ordinary O
circumstances O
they O
would O
have O
been O
adapted O
to O
his O

did O
not O

Sometimes O
the O
countenance O
of O
Theresa B-PERSON

The O
only O
difference O
between O
men O

in O
this O
respect O
is O
, O
that O
most O

not O

but O
if O
they O
have O
, O
female O
vanity O
is O
but O
a O
trifling O

airy O
passion O
compared O
with O
the O
vast O
voracity O
of O
appetite O

in O
the O
sterner O
sex O
can O
swallow O
anything O

always O
crave O

eyes O
sparkling O
with O
intelligence O

interest O

Coningsby S-PERSON
did O
not O
advance O
as O
was O
his O
custom O

he O
had O
a O
sort O
of O
instinct O

that O
the O
stranger O
was O
discoursing O
of O
matters O

he O
knew O
nothing O

He O
turned O
to O
a O
table O

he O
took O
up O
a O
book O
, O
which O
he O
began O
to O
read O
upside O
downwards O

A O
hand O

lightly O
placed O

looked O

another O

was O
very O
communicative O

calm O

without O

for O

reached O

seemed O

excite O
great O

Mr. O

frequently O
addressed O
his O
most O
lively O
observations O

his O
most O
sparkling O
anecdotes O
to O
Lady B-PERSON

Throughout O
the O
dinner O
Lady B-PERSON
Everingham E-PERSON

Mr. O

maintained O
what O
appeared O

" O
What O
a O
confession O
! O
What O
a O
revelation O
to O
Coningsby S-PERSON
of O
his O
infinite O
insignificance O
! O
Coningsby S-PERSON
entertained O
a O
great O
aversion O
for O
Mr. O
Melton S-PERSON
, O
but O
felt O
his O
spirit O
unequal O
to O
the O
social O
contest O
. O
The O
genius O
of O
the O
untutored O
inexperienced O
youth O
quailed O
before O
that O
of O
the O
long O
practised O
, O
skillful O
, O
man O

What O
was O
the O
magic O
of O
this O

was O
the O
secret O

this O
ease O

that O
nothing O
could O
disturb O

yet O
was O
not O
deficient O
in O
deference O

good O
taste O
? O
And O
then O
his O
dress O
, O
it O
seemed O
fashioned O
by O
some O
unearthly O
artist O

yet O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
detect O
the O
unobtrusive O
causes O
of O
the O
general O
effect O
that O
was O
irresistible O

Coningsby's O
coat O
was O
made O
by O
Stultz S-PERSON

almost O
every O
fellow O
in O
the O

his O
coats O
made O
by O
Stultz S-PERSON

yet O
Coningsby S-PERSON
fancied O
that O
his O

garment O
looked O
as O
if O
it O
had O
been O
furnished O
by O
some O
rustic O
slopseller O

He O
began O
to O
wonder O
where O
Mr. O

got O
his O
boots O
from O

and O
glanced O
at O
his O

which O
though O
made O
in O

where O

Unquestionably O
it O

a O
power O

Woman O

It O

Man O
that O
says O
, O
" O
I O
will O
be O
great O

it O
is O
the O

very O

not O

why O

Because O
a O

told O
him O
that O
the O

past O

Remarkable O
instance O
of O
the O
influence O
of O
an O

some O
evidence O

the O
extreme O
susceptibility O

our O

Even O
his O

Wonderful O

That O
however O

He O
opened O
the O

The O

was O
sweet O

even O
in O
this O
land O

He O
feels O

And O
by O

that O

only O
can O
be O
obtained O
at O
an O

A O

there O
slightly O
tinged O

It O
was O
a O
visage O
of O
energy O
and O
decision O
. O
He O
was O
about O
to O
pass O
through O
the O

his O
companions O
with O
whom O
his O
affairs O

not O
concluded O

when O
he O
observed O

who O
had O
risen O
. O
" O
This O
gentleman O
wishes O
to O

inquired O

bowed O
assent O

" O

" O

somewhat O
pettishly O

" O

him O

he O
was O
about O

go O

" O
I O
beg O
your O
pardon O

sir O

said O
Coningsby S-PERSON
, O
coming O
forward O
, O
and O
with O
an O
air O
of O
earnestness O
and O
grace O
that O
arrested O
the O
step O
of O
the O
manufacturer O

" O

moving O

Mr. O

stopped O

said O
: O

said O
Mr. O

opening O
a O

our O

wrote O

" O

Lancashire S-GPE
! O
" O
exclaimed O
the O
enthusiastic O
Mr. O
Benson S-PERSON
. O
The O
clerk O
spoke O
freely O
of O
his O
master O
, O
whom O
he O
evidently O
idolized O
, O
and O
his O
great O
achievements O

Coningsby S-PERSON
encouraged O
him O
. O
He O
detailed O
to O
Coningsby S-PERSON
the O
plans O

Mr. O

had O
pursued O
both O
for O

of O
his O

he O
had O
built O
churches O

institutes O

houses O

cottages O
on O

new O
system O
of O

how O
he O
had O
allotted O

established O
singing O
classes O

" O
Here O
is O
Mr. O
Millbank S-PERSON
, O
" O
continued O
the O
clerk O
, O
as O
he O
and O
Coningsby S-PERSON
, O
quitting O
the O
factory O
, O
re-entered O
the O
court O
. O
Mr. O
Millbank S-PERSON
was O
approaching O
the O
factory O
, O
and O
the O
moment O
that O
he O
observed O
them O
, O
he O
quickened O
his O
pace O
. O
" O
Mr. O
Coningsby S-PERSON
? O
" O
he O
said O
when O
he O
reached O
them O
. O
His O
countenance O
was O
rather O
disturbed O
, O
and O
his O
voice O
a O
little O
trembled O
, O
and O
he O
looked O
on O
our O
friend O
with O
a O
glance O
scrutinizing O
and O
serious O
. O
Coningsby S-PERSON
bowed O
. O
" O
I O
am O
sorry O
that O
you O
should O
have O

received O
at O
this O
place O
with O
so O
little O
ceremony O
, O
sir O

said O
Mr. O
Millbank S-PERSON

" O

had O
your O

mentioned O

you O
would O
have O
found O
it O
cherished O
here O

" O
He O
nodded O
to O
the O
clerk O
, O
who O
disappeared O
. O
Coningsby S-PERSON
began O
to O
talk O
about O
the O
wonders O
of O
the O
factory O
, O
but O
Mr. O
Millbank S-PERSON
recurred O
to O
other O
thoughts O
that O
were O
passing O
in O
his O
mind O
. O
He O
spoke O
of O
his O
son O
| | O
he O
expressed O
a O
kind O
reproach O
that O
Coningsby S-PERSON
should O
have O
thought O
of O
visiting O
this O
part O
of O
the O
world O
without O
giving O
them O
some O
notice O
of O
his O
intention O
, O
that O
he O
might O
have O
been O
their O
guest O
, O
that O
Oswald S-PERSON
might O
have O
made O
arrangements O
that O
he O
should O
see O
everything O
and O
in O
the O
best O
manner O
in O
short O
, O
that O
they O
might O
all O
have O
shown O
however O
slightly O
, O
the O
deep O
sense O
of O
their O
obligations O
to O
him O

my O
journey O

this O
famous O
district O

some O
days O

I O
ought O
to O
have O
found O
myself O
at O
Coningsby S-FAC

this O
is O
the O
reason O
why O
I O
am O
so O
pressed O
. O
" O
A O
cloud O
passed O
over O
the O
countenance O
of O
Millbank S-ORG
as O
the O
name O
of O
Lord O
Monmouth S-PERSON
was O
mentioned O
, O
but O
he O
said O
nothing O
. O
Turning O
towards O
Coningsby S-PERSON
, O
with O
an O
air O
of O
kindness O
: O
" O
At O
least O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
" O

not O

together O
through O
the O
village O

CHAPTER O
IV O
. O
The O
village O
clock O
struck O
five S-CARDINAL
as O
Mr. O
Millbank S-PERSON
and O
his O
guest O
entered O
the O
gardens O
of O
his O
mansion O
. O
Coningsby S-PERSON
lingered O
a O
moment O
to O
admire O
the O
beauty O
and O
gay O
profusion O
of O
the O
flowers O
. O
" O
Your O
situation O
, O
" O
said O
Coningsby S-PERSON
, O
looking O
up O
the O
green O
and O
silent O
valley O
, O
" O
is O
absolutely O
poetic O
. O
" O
" O
I O
try O
sometimes O
to O
fancy O
, O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Millbank S-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
rather O
fierce O
smile O
, O
" O
that O
I O
am O
in O
the O
New O
World O
. O
" O
" O
Papa O
! O
papa O
! O
" O
and O
instantly O
a O
young O
girl O
came O
bounding O
down O
the O
stairs O
, O
but O
suddenly O
seeing O
a O
stranger O
with O
her O
father O
she O
stopped O
upon O
the O
landing O
place O
and O
was O
evidently O
on O
the O
point O
of O
as O
rapidly O
retreating O
as O
she O
had O
advanced O
, O
when O
Mr. O
Millbank S-PERSON
waved O
his O
hand O
to O
her O
and O
begged O
her O
to O
descend O
. O
She O
came O
down O
slowly O
: O
as O
she O
approached O
them O
her O
father O
said O
: O
" O
A O
friend O

have O
often O
heard O
of O
Edith S-PERSON
: O
this O
is O

Coningsby S-PERSON

" O
She O
started O

blushed O
very O
much O
| | O
and O
then O
, O
with O
a O
trembling O
and O
uncertain O
gait O
, O
advanced O
, O
put O
forth O
her O
hand O
with O
a O
wild O
unstudied O
grace O
, O
and O
said O
in O
a O
tone O
of O
sensibility O
: O
" O
How O
often O
have O
we O
all O
wished O

daughter O

tender O
years S-DATE

apparently O
she O
could O
scarcely O
have O
counted O
sixteen B-DATE

She O
was O
delicate O
and O
fragile O

as O
she O
raised O
her O
still O
blushing O
visage O
to O
her O
father's O
guest O
, O
Coningsby S-PERSON
felt O
that O
he O
had O
never O
beheld O
a O
countenance O
of O
such O
striking O
and O
such O
peculiar O
beauty O

only O

Saxon S-NORP
. O
" O
But O
the O
beauty O
of O
the O
countenance O
was O
not O
the O
beauty O
of O
the O
Saxons S-NORP
. O
It O
was O
a O
radiant O
face O
, O
one O
of O
those O
that O
seem O
as O
if O
touched O
in O
their O
cradle O
by O
a O
sunbeam O
, O
and O
to O
have O
retained O
all O
its O
brilliancy O

suffused O

mantling O
lustre O

marks O
sometimes O
such O
faces O

diaphanous O
with O
delicate O
splendour O
, O
in O
the O
southern O
regions O
of O
France S-GPE
. O
Her O
eye O
too O
was O
the O
rare O
eye O
of O
Acquitaine O

soft O
and O
long O
, O
with O
lashes O
drooping O
over O
the O
cheek O

dark O
as O
her O
clustering O
ringlets O

entered O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O

bowing O
an O
apology O
for O
his O
inevitable O
frock O
and O
boots O

the O
maiden O
raised O
her O
eyes O
and O
bent O
her O
head O
. O
came O
somewhat O
suddenly O
into O
the O
room O
. O
She O
was O
playing O
with O
her O
dog O
, O
but O
ceased O
the O
moment O
she O
observed O

Coningsby S-PERSON
, O
who O
since O
his O
practice O
with O
Lady B-PERSON
Everingham E-PERSON
, O
flattered O
himself O
that O
he O
had O
advanced O
in O
small O
talk O
, O
and O
was O
not O
sorry O
that O
he O
had O
now O
an O
opportunity O
of O
proving O
his O
prowess O
, O
made O
some O
lively O
observations O
about O
pets O

the O
breeds O
of O
lap O

dogs O
, O
but O
he O
was O
not O
fortunate O
in O
extracting O
a O
response O
or O
exciting O
a O
repartee O
. O
He O
began O
then O
on O
the O
beauty O
of O
Millbank S-ORG
, O
which O
he O
would O
on O
no O
account O
have O
avoided O
seeing O
, O
and O
inquired O
when O
she O
had O
last O
heard O
of O
her O
brother O

The O
young O
lady O
, O
apparently O
much O
distressed O
, O
was O
murmuring O
something O
about O
Antwerp S-GPE

when O
the O
entrance O
of O
her O
father O
relieved O
her O
from O
her O
embarrassment O

Dinner O
being O
announced O
, O
Coningsby S-PERSON
offered O
his O
arm O
to O
his O
fair O
companion O
, O
who O
took O
it O
with O
her O
eyes O
fixed O
on O

are O
very O

the O
young O

young O

office O

a O
certain O
degree O
of O
desperate O
determination O
. O
She O
looked O
at O
a O
chicken O
and O
then O
at O
Coningsby S-FAC
, O
and O
murmured O
something O
which O
he O
understood O
. O
Sometimes O
she O
informed O
herself O
of O
his O
tasted O
or O
necessities O
in O
more O
detail O
, O
by O
the O
medium O
of O
her O
father O
, O
whom O
she O
treated O
as O
a O
sort O
of O
dragoman O
| | O
in O
this O
way O
: O
" O
Would O
not O
Mr. O
Coningsby S-PERSON
, O
papa O
, O
take O
this O
or O
that O
, O
or O
do O
so O
and O
so O
? O
" O
Coningsby S-PERSON
always O
was O
careful O
to O
reply O
in O
a O
direct O
manner O
without O
the O
agency O
of O
the O
interpreter O
| | O
but O
he O
did O
not O
advance O
. O
Even O
a O
petition O
for O
the O
great O
honour O
of O
taking O
a O
glass O
of O
sherry O
with O
her O
only O
induced O
the O
beautiful O
face O
to O
bow O
. O
And O
yet O
when O
she O
had O
first S-ORDINAL
seen O
him O
, O
she O
had O
addressed O
him O
even O
with O
emotion O
. O
What O
could O
it O
be O
? O
He O
felt O
less O
confidence O
in O
his O
increased O
power O
of O
conversation O
. O
Why O
Theresa B-PERSON
Sydney E-PERSON
was O
scarcely O
a O
year O
older O
than O
Miss O
Millbank S-PERSON
, O
and O
though O
she O
did O
not O
certainly O
originate O
like O
Lady B-PERSON
Everingham E-PERSON
, O
he O
got O
on O
with O
her O
perfectly O
well O
. O
fluently O
and O
well O
| | O
on O
all O
subjects O
his O
opinions O
seemed O
to O
be O
decided O
, O
and O
his O
language O
was O
precise O
. O
He O
was O
really O
interested O
in O
what O
Coningsby S-PERSON
had O
seen O
, O
and O
what O
he O
had O
felt O
| | O
and O
this O
sympathy O
divested O
his O
manner O
of O
the O
disagreeable O
effect O
that O
accompanies O
a O
tone O
inclined O
to O
be O
dictatorial O
. O
More O
than O
once O
Coningsby S-PERSON
observed O
the O
silent O
daughter O
listening O
with O
extreme O
attention O
to O
the O
conversation O
of O
himself O
and O
her O
father O
. O
The O
dessert O
was O
remarkable O
. O
Millbank S-PERSON
was O
very O
proud O
of O
his O
fruit O
. O
A O
bland O
expression O
of O
self O
- O
complacency O
spread O
over O
his O
features O
as O
he O
surveyed O
his O
grapes O
, O
his O
peaches O
, O
his O
figs O
. O
" O
Those O
grapes O
have O
gained O
a O
medal O
, O
" O
he O
told O
Coningsby S-PERSON
. O
" O
Those O
two S-CARDINAL
are O
prize O
peaches O
. O
I O
have O
not O
yet O
been O
so O
successful O
with O
my O

These O
however O
promise O
, O
and O
perhaps O
this O
year O
I O
may O
be O
more O
fortunate O

" O
" O
What O
would O
your O
brother O

myself O
have O
given O
for O
such O
a O
dessert O
at O
Eton S-GPE
! O
" O
said O
Coningsby S-PERSON
to O
Miss O
Millbank S-PERSON
, O
wishing O
to O
say O
something O
, O
and O
something O
too O
that O
might O
interest O
her O
. O
She O
seemed O
infinitely O
distressed O
, O
and O
yet O
this O
time O
would O
speak O
: O
" O
Let O
me O
give O
you O
some O
. O
" O
He O
caught O
by O
chance O
her O
glance O
immediately O
withdrawn O
| | O
yet O
it O
was O
a O
glance O
not O
only O
of O
beauty O
, O
but O
of O
feeling O
and O
thought O
. O
She O
added O
, O
in O
a O
hushed O
and O
hurried O
tone O
, O
dividing O
very O
nervously O
some O
grapes O
: O
" O
I O
hardly O
know O
whether O
Oswald S-PERSON
will O
be O
most O
pleased O

grieved O
when O
he O
hears O
that O
you O
have O
been O
here O
. O
" O
" O
And O
why O
grieved O
? O
" O
said O
Coningsby S-PERSON
. O
" O
That O
he O
should O
not O

here O
to O
welcome O

that O
your O
stay O
is O
for O
so O
brief O
a O
time O
. O
It O
seems O
so O
strange O
that O
after O
having O
talked O
of O
you O

years S-DATE

we O
should O
see O

hours O

" O

" O
rose O

left O
the O
room O
, O
so O
suddenly O

so O
quickly O
that O
Coningsby S-PERSON
could O
scarcely O
gain O
the O
door O
. O
" O
Yes O
, O
" O
said O
Millbank S-PERSON
filling O
his O
glass O
, O
and O
pursuing O
some O
previous O
observations O
, O
" O

compensating O
in O

The O
declining O

over O

rich O
colour O

Coningsby S-PERSON
approached O

lit O
up O

Our O
young O
friend O
felt O
a O
little O
embarrassed O
when O
, O
without O
a O
a O
servant O
and O
in O
a O
hack O
chaise O
, O
he O
drew O
up O
to O
the O
grand O
portal O
, O
and O
a O
crowd O
of O
retainers O
came O
forth O
to O
receive O
him O
. O
A O
superior O
servant O
inquired O
his O
name O
with O
a O
stately O
composure O
, O
that O
disdained O
to O
be O
supercilious O
. O
It O
was O
not O
without O
some O
degree O
of O
pride O
and O
satisfaction O
that O
the O
guest O
replied O
, O
" O
Mr. O
Coningsby S-PERSON
. O
" O
The O
instantaneous O
effect O
was O
magical O
. O
It O
seemed O
to O
Coningsby S-PERSON
that O
he O
was O
borne O
on O
the O
shoulders O
of O
the O
people O
to O
his O
apartment O

tried O
to O
carry O
some O
part O
of O
his O
luggage O

he O
only O
hoped O
his O
welcome O
from O
their O
superiors O
might O
be O
as O
hearty O
. O
CHAPTER O
VI O
. O
seemed O
an O
overwhelming O
affair O
. O
The O
sight O
of O
the O
servants O
bewildered O
him O
| | O
how O
then O
was O
he O
to O
encounter O
their O
masters O
? O
That O
however O
he O
must O
do O
in O
a O
moment O
. O
A O
groom O
of O
the O
chambers O
indicates O
the O
way O
to O
him O
, O
as O
he O
proceeds O
with O
a O
hesitating O
yet O
hurried O
step O
through O
several O
ante-chambers O
and O
drawing O
- O
rooms O

then O
doors O
are O
suddenly O
thrown O
open O
, O
and O
he O
is O
ushered O
into O
the O
largest O
and O
most O
sumptuous O
saloon O
that O
he O
had O
ever O
entered O
. O
It O
was O
full O
of O
ladies O
and O
gentlemen O
. O
Coningsby S-PERSON
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
in O
his O
life O
was O
at O
a O
great O
party O
. O
His O
immediate O
emotion O
was O
to O
sink O
into O
the O
earth O
, O
but O
perceiving O
that O
no O
one O
even O
noticed O
him O
, O
and O
that O
not O
an O
eye O
had O
been O
attracted O
to O
his O
entrance O
, O
he O
regained O
his O
breath O
and O
in O
some O
degree O
his O
composure O
, O
and O
standing O
aside O
, O
endeavoured O
to O
make O
himself O
as O
well O
as O
he O
could O
master O
of O
the O
land O
. O
our O
young O
friend O
, O
by O
an O
inevitable O
association O
of O
ideas O
, O
to O
remember O
that O
, O
unknown O
and O
unnoticed O
as O
he O
might O
be O
, O
he O
was O
the O
only O
Coningsby S-PERSON
in O
that O
proud O
Castle S-PERSON
, O
except O
the O
Lord O
of O
the O
castle O
himself O
| | O
and O
he O
began O
to O
be O
rather O
ashamed O
of O
permitting O
a O
sense O
of O
his O
inexperience O
in O
the O
mere O
forms O
and O
fashions O
of O
society O
so O
to O
oppress O
him O
, O
and O
deprive O
him O
as O
it O
were O
of O
the O
spirit O
and O
carriage O
which O
became O
alike O
his O
character O
and O
his O
position O
. O
Emboldened O
and O
greatly O
restored O
to O
himself O
, O
Coningsby S-PERSON
advanced O
into O
the O
body O
of O
the O
saloon O
. O
consummate O
bearing O
. O
He O
looked O
indeed O
the O
chieftain O
of O
a O
house O
of O
whom O
a O
cadet O
might O
be O
proud O
. O
grandfather O
? O
To O
announce O
himself O
as O
Coningsby S-PERSON
, O
as O
his O
Lordship's S-PERSON
grandson O
, O
seemed O
somewhat O
ridiculous O
. O
To O
address O
his O
grandfather O
as O
Lord O
Monmouth S-PERSON
would O
serve O
no O
purpose O
| | O
to O
style O
Lord O
Monmouth S-PERSON
" O
grandfather O
, O
" O
would O
make O
every O
one S-CARDINAL
laugh O
and O
seemed O
stiff O
and O
unnatural O
. O
What O
was O
he O
to O
do O
? O
To O
fall O
into O
an O
attitude O
, O
and O
exclaim O
, O
" O
Behold O
your O
grandchild O
! O
" O
or O
" O
Have O
you O
forgot O
your O
Harry S-PERSON
? O
" O
Even O
to O
catch O
Lord O
Monmouth's S-PERSON
glance O
was O
not O
a O
very O
easy O
affair O
| | O
he O
was O
much O
engaged O
on O
one S-CARDINAL
side O
by O
the O
great O
lady O
| | O
on O
the O
other O
were O
several O
gentlemen O
who O
occasionally O
joined O
in O
the O
conversation O
. O
But O
something O
must O
be O
done O
. O
Duchess O
who O
was O
a O
fine O
judge O
of O
character O
, O
and O
who O
greatly O
regarded O
Coningsby S-PERSON
, O
often O
mentioned O
this O
trait O
as O
one O
which O
, O
combined O
with O
his O
great O
abilities O
and O
acquirements O
so O
unusual O
at O
his O
age O
, O
rendered O
him O
so O
very O
interesting O
. O
In O
the O
present O
instance O
it O
so O
happened O
, O
that O
while O
Coningsby S-PERSON
was O
watching O
his O
grandfather O
, O
he O
observed O
a O
gentleman O
advance O
, O
make O
his O
bow O
, O
say O
and O
receive O
a O
few O
words O
, O
and O
retire O
. O
This O
little O
incident O
however O
made O
a O
momentary O
diversion O
in O
the O
immediate O
circle O
of O
Lord O
Monmouth S-PERSON
, O
and O
before O
they O
could O
all O
resume O
their O
former O
talk O
and O
fall O
into O
their O
previous O
positions O
, O
an O
impulse O
sent O
forth O
Coningsby S-PERSON
, O
who O
walked O
up O
to O
Lord O
Monmouth S-PERSON
, O
and O
standing O
before O
him O
, O
said O
: O
" O
How O
do O
you O
do O
, O
grandpapa O
? O
" O
world O
. O
And O
this O
was O
his O
child O

the O
only O
one O
of O
his O
blood O
to O
whom O
he O
had O
been O
kind O
. O
It O
would O
be O
exaggeration O
to O
say O
that O
Lord O
Monmouth's S-PERSON
heart O
was O
touched O
| | O
but O
his O
good O
- O
nature O
effervesced O
, O
and O
his O
fine O
taste O
was O
deeply O
gratified O
. O
He O
perceived O
in O
an O
instant O
such O
a O
relation O
might O
be O
a O
valuable O
adherent O
| | O
an O
irresistible O
candidate O
for O
future O
elections O
| | O
a O
brilliant O
tool O
to O
work O
out O
the O
Dukedom O
. O
All O
these O
impressions O
and O
ideas O
, O
and O
many O
more O
, O
passed O
through O
the O
quick O
brain O
of O
Lord O
Monmouth S-PERSON
ere O
the O
sound O
of O
Coningsby's S-PERSON
words O
had O
seemed O
to O
cease O
, O
and O
long O
before O
the O
surrounding O
guests O
had O
recovered O
from O
the O
surprise O
which O
they O
had O
occasioned O
them O
| | O
and O
which O
did O
not O
diminish O
when O
Lord O
Monmouth S-PERSON
advancing O
placed O
his O
arms O
round O
Coningsby S-PERSON
with O
a O
dignity O
of O
affection O
that O
would O
have O
become O
Louis B-PERSON
XIV E-PERSON
, O
and O
then O
in O
the O
high O
manner O
of O
the O
old O
Court S-ORG
kissed O
him O
on O
each O
cheek O

" O
Welcome O

led O
him O
across O

His O

hero O
as O
graciously O
as O
the O
grandson O
of O
Lord O
Monmouth S-PERSON
might O
expect O

but O
no O
greeting O
can O
be O
imagined O
warmer O
than O
the O
one O
he O
received O
from O
the O
lady O
with O
whom O
the O
Archduke S-PERSON
was O
conversing O
. O
She O
was O
a O
dame O
whose O
beauty O
was O
mature O

workmanship O

her O

some O

, O

neither O

who O
were O
very O
amusing O

very O

CHAPTER O
VII O
. O
tempt O
her O
, O
although O
she O
was O
unable O
to O
refuse O
her O
heart O
to O
one O
whom O
she O
deemed O
worthy O
of O
possessing O
it O
. O
She O
found O
her O
fate O
in O
an O
Englishman S-NORP
, O
who O
was O
the O
father O
of O
her O
only O
child O
, O
a O
daughter O
. O
She O
thought O
she O
had O
met O
in O
him O
a O
hero O
, O
a O
demi-god O
, O
a O
being O
of O
deep O
passion O
and O
original O
and O
creative O
mind O
| | O
but O
he O
was O
only O
a O
voluptuary O
, O
full O
of O
violence O
instead O
of O
feeling O
, O
and O
eccentric O
because O
he O
had O
great O
means O
with O
which O
he O
could O
gratify O
extravagant O
whims O
. O
Stella S-PERSON
found O
she O
had O
made O
the O
great O
and O
irretrievable O
mistake O
. O
She O
had O
exchanged O
devotion O
for O
a O
passionate O
and O
evanescent O
fancy O
, O
prompted O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
by O
vanity O
, O
and O
daily O
dissipating O
under O
the O
influence O
of O
custom O
and O
new O
objects O
. O
Though O
not O
stainless O
in O
conduct O
, O
Stella S-PERSON
was O
pure O
in O
spirit O
. O
She O
required O
that O
devotion O
which O
she O
had O
yielded O
| | O
and O
she O
separated O
herself O
from O
the O
being O
to O
whom O
she O
had O
made O
the O
most O
precious O
sacrifice O
. O
He O
offered O
her O
the O
consoling O
compensation O
of O
a O
settlement O
which O
she O
refused O
| | O
and O
she O
returned O
with O
a O
broken O
spirit O
to O
that O
profession O
of O
which O
she O
was O
still O
the O
ornament O
and O
the O
pride O
. O
The O
animating O
principle O
of O
her O
career O
was O
her O
daughter O
, O
whom O
she O
educated O
with O
a O
solicitude O
which O
the O
most O
virtuous O
mother O
could O
not O
surpass O
. O
To O
preserve O
her O
from O
the O
stage O
, O
and O
to O
secure O
for O
her O
an O
independence O
, O
were O
the O
objects O
of O
the O
mother's O
life O
| | O
but O
nature O
whispered O
to O
her O
, O
that O
the O
days O
of O
that O
life O
were O
already O
numbered O
. O
The O
exertions O
of O
her O
profession O
had O
alarmingly O
developed O
an O
inherent O
tendency O
to O
pulmonary O
disease O
. O
Anxious O
that O
her O
child O
should O
not O
be O
left O
without O
some O
protector O
, O
Stella S-PERSON
yielded O
to O
the O
repeated O
solicitations O
of O
one O
who O
from O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
had O
been O
her O
silent O
admirer O
, O
and O
she O
married O
Villebecque S-PERSON
, O
a O
clever O
actor O
, O
and O
an O
enterprising O
man O
who O
meant O
to O
be O
something O
more O
. O
Their O
union O
was O
not O
of O
long O
duration O
, O
though O
it O
was O
happy O
on O
the O
side O
of O
Villebecque S-PERSON
, O
and O
serene O
on O
that O
of O
his O
wife O
. O
Stella S-PERSON
was O
recalled O
from O
this O
world O
, O
where O
she O
had O
known O
much O
triumph O
and O
more O
suffering O
| | O
and O
where O
she O
had O
exercised O
many O
virtues O
, O
which O
elsewhere O
, O
though O
not O
here O
, O
may O
perhaps O
be O
accepted O
as O
some O
palliation O
of O
one S-CARDINAL
great O
error O
. O
Villebecque S-PERSON
acted O
becomingly O
to O
the O
young O
charge O
which O
Stella S-PERSON
had O
bequeathed O
to O
him O
. O
He O
was O
himself O
, O
as O
we O
have O
intimated O
, O
a O
man O
of O
enterprise O
, O
a O
restless O
spirit O
, O
not O
content O
to O
move O
for O
ever O
in O
the O
sphere O
in O
which O
he O
was O
born O
. O
Vicissitudes O
are O
the O
lot O
of O
such O
aspirants O
. O
Villebecque S-PERSON
became O
manager O
of O
a O
small O
theatre O
, O
and O
made O
money O
. O
If O
Villebecque S-PERSON
, O
without O
a O
" O
sous O
, O
" O
had O
been O
a O
schemer O
, O
Villebecque S-PERSON
with O
a O
small O
capital O
was O
the O
very O
Chevalier O
Law O
of O
theatrical O
managers O
. O
He O
took O
a O
larger O
theatre O
and O
even O
that O
succeeded O
. O
Soon O
he O
was O
recognised O
as O
the O
lessee O
of O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
one E-CARDINAL
, O
and O
still O
he O
prospered O
. O
Villebecque S-PERSON
began O
to O
dabble O
in O
Opera S-ORG
houses O
. O
He O
enthroned O
himself O
at O
Paris S-GPE

his O
envoys O
were O

ranked O
among O

Villebecque S-PERSON
rolled O
in O
chariots O
and O
drove O
cabs O
| | O
Villebecque S-PERSON
gave O
refined O
suppers O
to O
great O
nobles O
, O
who O
were O
honoured O
by O
the O
invitation O

Villebecque S-PERSON
wore O
a O
red O
riband O
in O
the O

, O
and O

All O
this O
time O
the O
daughter O
of O
Stella S-PERSON
increased O
in O
years S-DATE
and O
stature O
, O
and O
we O
must O
add O
in O
goodness O
: O
a O
mild O
soft O
- O
hearted O
girl O
, O
as O
yet O
with O
no O
decided O
character O
, O
but O
one O
who O
loved O
calmness O
and O
seemed O
little O
fitted O
for O
the O
circle O
in O
which O
she O
found O
herself O
. O
In O
that O
circle O
however O
she O
ever O
experienced O
kindness O

No O

If O
only O
for O
one S-CARDINAL
breathless O
instant O
, O
hardly O
a O
day O
elapsed O
but O
he O
saw O
her O

was O
his O
companion O
in O
all O
his O
rapid O
movements O

he O
had O
also O

It O
was O
a O
life O

the O
talent O

Their O

was O
rather O
hard O

handy O

spoke O

a O
fault O
rare O

this O

idea O

The O
enterprising O
genius O
of O
Villebecque S-PERSON

once O

prompted O
him O
to O
action O

He O
felt O
an O
itching O
desire O

announce O
a O
novelty O

He O
fancied O
Lord O

yawned O
once O
or O
twice O
when O
the O
heroine O
came O
on O

Villebecque S-PERSON
wanted O
to O

clear O
that O

True O
it O
was O
she O
had O
a O
great O
repugnance O
to O
come O
out O

but O
it O
certainly O
seemed O
more O
to O
her O
advantage O
that O

should O
make O

could O
have O

nothing O

Coningsby S-PERSON
watched O
her O
as O
she O
swept O
along O
like O
a O
resistless O
Fate O

Servants O

A O

came O
forward O

bowed O

Lord O

notified O
to O
his O

wished O
him O
to O
be O
her O
beau O

It O
was O
a O
very O
pretty O
theatre O

had O
been O
rapidly O
rubbed O
up O
, O
and O
renovated O
here O
and O
there O

the O
painting O
just O
touched O

a O
little O
gilding O
on O
a O
cornice O

There O
were O
no O
boxes O
, O
but O
the O
ground O
floor O
which O
gradually O
ascended O
was O
carpeted O
, O
and O
covered O
with O
arm O
- O
chairs O
, O
and O
the O
back O
of O
the O
theatre O

curtain O

accompanied O
by O
another O

The O
lights O
rise O

evidently O
crosses O
the O
stage O
behind O
the O
curtain O

They O
are O
disposing O

scene O

In O
a O
moment O
the O
curtain O
will O
rise O
also O
. O
" O
Have O
you O
seen O
Lucretia S-PERSON
? O
" O
said O
the O
Princess O
to O
Coningsby S-PERSON
. O
" O
She O
is O
so O
anxious O
to O
resume O
her O
acquaintance O
with O
you O

" O
But O
before O
he O
could O
answer O
the O
bell O
rang O
, O
and O
the O
curtain O
rose O
. O
approbation O
. O
Her O
agitation O
is O
extreme O

she O
curtseys O
, O
and O
bows O
her O
head O
, O
as O
if O
to O
hide O
her O
face O
. O
The O
face O
was O
pleasing O
, O
and O
pretty O
enough O
| | O
soft O
and O
engaging O
. O
Her O
figure O
slight O
and O
graceful O
. O
Nothing O
could O
be O
more O
perfect O
than O
her O
costume O

purely O
white O
, O
but O
the O
fashion O
consummate O

a O
single O
rose O
her O
only O
ornament O
. O
All O
admitted O
that O
her O
hair O
was O
arranged O
to O
admiration O
. O
At O
length O
she O
spoke O
| | O
her O
voice O
trembled O
, O
but O
she O
had O
a O
good O
elocution O
though O
her O
organ O
wanted O
force O
. O
The O
gentlemen O
looked O
at O
each O
other O
, O
and O
nodded O
approbation O
. O
There O
was O
something O
so O
unobstrusive O
in O
her O
mien O
, O
that O
she O
instantly O
became O
a O
favourite O
with O
the O
ladies O
. O
The O
scene O
was O
not O
long O
, O
but O
it O
was O
triumphant O
. O
of O
youth O
. O
His O
dress O
too O
was O
admirable O
. O
He O
had O
studied O
the O
most O
distinguished O
of O
his O
audience O
for O
the O
occasion O
, O
and O
had O
outdone O
them O
all O
. O
The O
fact O
is O
, O
he O
had O
been O
assisted O
a O
little O
by O
a O
great O
connoisseur O
, O
a O
celebrated O
French S-NORP
nobleman O
, O
Count B-PERSON
D— I-PERSON
y E-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
been O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
guests O
. O
The O
thing O
was O
perfect O
, O
and O
Lord O
Monmouth S-PERSON
took O
a O
pinch O
of O
snuff O
, O
and O
tapped O
approbation O
on O
the O
top O
of O
his O
box O
. O
of O
her O
tones O
thrilled O
from O
the O
heart O
: O
suddenly O
she O
clasped O
her O
hands O
with O
all O
the O
exhaustion O
of O
woe O
| | O
an O
expression O
of O
agony O
flitted O
over O
her O
countenance O
| | O
and O
she O
burst O
into O
tears O
. O
Villebecque S-PERSON
rushed O
forward O
, O
and O
carried O
rather O
than O
led O
her O
from O
the O
stage O
| | O
the O
audience O
looking O
at O
each O
other O
, O
some O
of O
them O
suspecting O
that O
this O
movement O
was O
a O
part O
of O
the O
scene O
. O
" O
She O
has O
talent O
, O
" O
said O
Lord O
Monmouth S-PERSON
to O
the O
Russian S-NORP
ambassadress O
, O
" O
but O
wants O
practice O
. O
Villebecque S-PERSON
should O
send O
her O
for O
a O
time O
to O
the O
provinces O
. O
" O
At O
length O
M. B-PERSON
Villebecque E-PERSON
came O
forward O
to O
express O
his O
deep O
regret O
that O
the O
sudden O
and O
severe O
indisposition O
of O
Mlle S-PERSON
. O
Flora S-PERSON
rendered O
it O
impossible O
for O
the O
company O
to O
proceed O
with O
the O
piece O
| | O
but O
that O
the O
curtain O
would O
descend O
to O
rise O
again O
for O
the O
second S-ORDINAL
and O
last O
piece O
announced O
. O
figured O
in O
male O
attire O

and O
in O
air O
, O
fashion O
, O
and O
youth O
, O
beat O
Villebecque S-PERSON
out O
of O
the O
field O
. O
She O
looked O
younger O
than O
Coningsby S-PERSON
when O
he O
went O
up O
to O
his O
grand O
- O
papa O
. O
The O
comedy O
was O
over O
, O
the O
curtain O
fell O
, O
the O
audience O
much O
amused O
chattered O
brilliant O
criticism O
, O
and O
quitted O
the O
theatre O
to O
repair O
to O
the O
saloon O
where O
they O
were O
to O
be O
diverted O
to O
- O
night O
with O
Russian S-NORP
dances O
. O
Nobody O
thought O
of O
the O
unhappy O
Flora S-PERSON

not O
a O
single O
message O
to O
console O
her O
in O
her O
grief O

compliment O
her O

what O
she O
had O
done O

to O
encourage O
her O
future O

And O
yet O
it O
was O
a O
season O
for O
a O
word O
of O
kindness O

so O
at O
least O
thought O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
audience O
, O
as O
he O
lingered O
behind O
the O
hurrying O
crowd O

coming O
amusements O

labouring O
for O
their O
amusement O

who O
was O
suffering O
for O
her O
trial O

He O
got O
on O
the O
stage O
, O
ran O
behind O
the O
scenes O
, O

asked O
for O
Mlle S-PERSON

Flora O

They O
pointed O
to O
a O
door O

requested O
permission O

Flora S-PERSON

sitting O
at O
a O

then O
advancing O
to O
her O

added O
: O

Lord O

bowed O

Coningsby S-PERSON
occasionally O
took O
advantage O

" O
The O
Marquess S-PERSON
spoke O
with O
an O
animation O
unusual O
with O
him O
, O
almost O
with O
a O
degree O
of O
excitement O

The O
wind O
met O
them O
as O
they O
returned O
, O
the O
breeze O
blew O
rather O
freshly O
. O
Lucretia S-PERSON
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
seemed O
touched O
with O
unusual O
emotion O
. O
She O
was O
alarmed O
lest O
Lord O
Monmouth S-PERSON
should O
catch O
cold O

she O
took O
a O
kerchief O
from O
her O
own O
well O
- O
turned O
throat O
to O
tie O
round O
his O
neck O
. O
He O
feebly O
resisted O
, O
evidently O
much O
pleased O
. O
distinguished O
guests O
, O
but O
instantly O
yielding O
to O
the O
request O
of O
Lord O
Monmouth S-PERSON
, O
she O
sang O
. O
It O
was O
impossible O
to O
conceive O
a O
contralto O
of O
more O
thrilling O
power O
, O
or O
an O
execution O
more O
worthy O
of O
the O
voice O
. O
Coningsby S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
not O
experienced O
in O
fine O
singing O
, O
listened O
as O
if O
to O
a O
supernatural O
lay O
, O
but O
all O
agreed O
it O
was O
of O
the O
highest O
class O
of O
nature O
and O
of O
art O
| | O
and O
the O
Archduke S-PERSON
was O
in O
raptures O
. O
Lucretia S-PERSON
received O
even O
his O
Highness's S-PERSON
compliments O
with O
a O
graceful O
indifference O
. O
Indeed O
to O
those O
who O
watched O
her O
demeanour O
, O
it O
might O
be O
remarked O
that O
she O
seemed O
to O
yield O
to O
none O
, O
although O
all O
bowed O
before O
her O
. O
Madame O
Colonna S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
always O
extremely O
kind O
to O
Coningsby S-PERSON
, O
expressed O
to O
him O
her O
gratification O
from O
the O
party O
of O
the B-TIME
morning E-TIME
. O
It O
must O
have O
been O
delightful O
, O
she O
assured O
Coningsby S-PERSON
, O
for O
Lord O
Monmouth S-PERSON
to O
have O
had O
both O
Lucretia S-PERSON
and O
his O
grandson O
with O
him O

and O
Lucretia S-PERSON
too O
, O
she O
added O
, O
must O
have O
been O
so O
pleased O
. O
his O
existence O
, O
looked O
forward O
with O
such O
gratification O
to O
his O
society O
, O
remembered O
with O
so O
much O
pleasure O
the O
past O
, O
anticipated O
so O
much O
happiness O
from O
the O
future O
. O
It O
appeared O
to O
him O
that O
he O
was O
to O
Lucretia S-PERSON
, O
if O
not O
an O
object O
of O
repugnance O
, O
as O
he O
sometimes O
fancied O
, O
certainly O
one O
only O
of O
absolute O
indifference O
| | O
but O
he O
said O
nothing O
. O
He O
had O
already O
lived O
long O
enough O
to O
know O
that O
it O
is O
unwise O
to O
wish O
every O
thing O
explained O
. O
that O
she O
liked O
him O
almost O
as O
much O
as O
Lucretia S-PERSON
did O
| | O
the O
Russians S-NORP
persisted O
in O
always O
styling O
him O
" O
the O
young O
Marquess S-PERSON
, O
" O
notwithstanding O
the O
Ambassador's S-WORK_OF_ART
explanations O

Mrs. O
Guy B-PERSON
Flouncey E-PERSON
made O
a O
dashing O
attack O
on O
him O

but O
Coningsby S-PERSON
remembered O
a O
lesson O
which O
Lady B-PERSON
Everingham E-PERSON
had O
graciously O
bestowed O
on O
him O
. O
He O
was O
not O
to O
be O
caught O
again O
easily O
. O
Besides O
Mrs. O
Guy B-PERSON
Flouncey E-PERSON
laughed O
a O
little O
too O
much O
, O
and O
talked O
a O
little O
too O
loud O
. O
women O
. O
To O
be O
sure O
his O
station O
was O
eminent O
| | O
he O
was O
noble O
, O
and O
very O
rich O
, O
and O
very O
powerful O
, O
and O
these O
are O
qualities O
which O
tell O
as O
much O
with O
the O
softer O
as O
the O
harsher O
sex O
| | O
— O
but O
there O
are O
individuals O
with O
all O
these O
qualities O
who O
are O
nevertheless O
unpopular O
with O
women O
. O
Lord O
Eskdals S-PERSON
was O
easy O
, O
knew O
the O
world O
thoroughly O
, O
had O
no O
prejudices O
, O
and O
above O
all O
, O
had O
a O
reputation O
for O
success O
. O
A O
reputation O
for O
success O
has O
as O
much O
influence O
with O
women O
, O
as O
a O
reputation O
for O
wealth O
has O
with O
men O
. O
Both O
reputations O
may O
be O
, O
and O
often O
are O
, O
unjust O

but O
we O
see O
persons O
daily O
make O
good O
fortunes O
by O
them O
all O
the O
same O
. O
Lord O
Eskdale S-PERSON
was O
not O
an O
impostor O

and O
though O
he O
might O
not O
have O
been O
so O
successful O
a O
man O
had O
he O
not O
been O
Lord O
Eskdale S-PERSON
, O
still O
thrown O
over O
by O
a O
revolution O
, O
he O
would O
have O
lighted O
on O
his O
legs O
. O
contributed O
to O
the O
happiness O
of O
poor O
Flora S-PERSON
. O
True O
it O
was O
, O
in O
the O
evening O
she O
often O
found O
herself O
sitting O
or O
standing O
alone O
and O
no O
one O
noticing O
her O
| | O
she O
had O
no O
dazzling O
quality O
to O
attract O
men O
of O
fashion O
, O
who O
themselves O
love O
to O
wordship O
ever O
the O
fashionable O

Even O
their O
goddesses O
must O
be O
" O
à O

mode O

" O
But O
Coningsby S-PERSON
never O
omitted O
an O
opportunity O
to O
show O
Flora S-PERSON
some O
kindness O
under O
these O
circumstances O
. O
He O
always O
came O
and O
talked O
to O
her O
, O
and O
praised O
her O
singing O
, O
and O
would O
sometimes O
hand O
her O
refreshments O
and O
give O
her O
his O
arm O
if O
necessary O
. O
These O
slight O
attentions O
coming O
from O
the O
grandson O
of O
Lord O
Monmouth S-PERSON
were O
for O
the O
world O
redoubled O
in O
their O
value O
| | O
though O
Flora S-PERSON
thought O
only O
of O
their O
essential O
kindness O

all O
in O
character O
with O
that O
first S-ORDINAL
visit O

dwelt O
on O
the O
poor O
girl's O
memory O
, O
though O
it O
had O
long O
ago O
escaped O
that O
of O
her O
visitor O
. O
For O
in O
truth O
Coningsby S-PERSON
had O
no O
other O
impulse O
for O
his O
conduct O
but O
kind O
- O
heartedness O
. O
the O
infinite O
disgust O
of O
Lady B-PERSON
St. I-PERSON
Julians E-PERSON
who O
had O
a O
daughter O
with O
her O
, O
successfully O
entrapped O
the O
devoted O
attentions O
of O
the O
young O
Marquess O
of O
Beaumanoir S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
never O
very O
backward O
if O
a O
lady O
would O
take O
trouble O
enough O

friend O
Mr. O

barren O
homage O
Lady B-PERSON
St. I-PERSON
Julians E-PERSON
wished O
her O
daughter O
ever O

all O
his O
gaiety O

good O
humour O

in O

with O
irresistible O
effect O

For O
the O
rest O

continued O

had O
only O
partridges O
to O

pass O
the O

The O
Archduke S-PERSON

his O
suite O
, O
guided O
by O
Mr. O
Rigby S-PERSON
, O
had O
always O
some O
objects O
to O
visit O
, O
and O

returned O
them O
just O
in O
time O
for O
the O
banquet O
with O
an O
appetite O
which O
they O
had O
earned O

during O
which O
Rigby S-PERSON
recounted O
their O
achievements O

his O
own O
opinions O

which O
is O
the O
spell O
of O
a O
country O
- O
house O
. O
Lord O
Monmouth S-PERSON
was O
satisfied O
for O
he O
had O
scarcely O
ever O
felt O
wearied O
. O
All O
that O
he O
required O
in O
life O
was O
to O
be O
amused O

perhaps O
that O
was O
not O
all O
he O
required O
, O
but O
it O
was O
indispensable O
. O
Nor O
was O
it O
wonderful O
that O
on O
the O
present O
occasion O
he O
obtained O
his O
purpose O

on O

to O
secure O
him O
distraction O

The O
only O
circumstance O
that O
annoyed O
him O
was O
the O
non-arrival O
of O
Sidonia S-GPE

Lord O
Monmouth S-PERSON
could O
not O
bear O
to O
be O
disappinted O

He O
could O
not O
refrain O
from O
saying O
notwithstanding O
all O
the O
resources O

all O
the O
exertions O
of O
his O
guests O
: O
" O

" O
So O

Between O

Sidonia E-GPE
passed O
two B-DATE

spent O

in O
the O
dissipation O

was O
perhaps O
inseparable O

He O

Though O
very O

If O
you O
pressed O
him O

he O
took O
refuge O

threw O
out O

quitted O

Sidonia S-PERSON

five B-DATE

he O
never O

They O
were O
aware O

only O
by O
the O
orders O

he O
drew O
on O
them O

which O
frequently O
arrived O
from O
all O
quarters O

It O
would O
appear O
from O
these O

that O
he O
had O
dwelt O
a O
considerable O
time O
in O
the O
Mediterranean S-LOC

penetrated O
Nilotic B-LOC

visited O
Hindostan S-GPE

the O

that O
Indian S-NORP

are O
so O

at O

at O
Mexico S-GPE

the B-GPE

One B-TIME

without O

he O
arrived O
in O

to O
their O
last O

had O
himself O
illustrated O

He O
had O
lived O
in O

viewed O
every O

been O

He O
brought O
to O
the O
study O
of O
this O
vast O
aggregate O
of O
knowledge O
a O
penetrative O
intellect O

that O
matured O

long O
meditation O

assisted O
by O
that O
absolute O
freedom O
from O

which O
was O
the O
compensatory O
possession O
of O
a O

permitted O

fathom O

the O
depth O
of O
questions O
apparently O
the O
most O
difficult O

He O
possessed O
the O
rare O
faculty O

communicating O
with O
precision O
ideas O
the O
most O
abstruse O

Sidonia S-PERSON

looked O
upon O

a O

rather O

His O

out O

" O
Mon O

up O

So O
Coningsby S-PERSON
unwillingly O
approached O
Lucretia S-PERSON

talking O
with O
the O
Russian S-NORP
Ambassador O

" O
I O

Coningsby S-PERSON
looking O
at O
her O

catching O
her O
glance O
. O
" O
What O

why O
? O
" O
she O
replied O

" O
The O
mission O
is O
to O
entreat O
you O

us O
all O

the O

" O
" O
I O

" O
said O
Coningsby S-PERSON
bending O
to O
the O
Ambassador O
. O
" O
Remember O
, O
" O
said O
Lucretia S-PERSON
as O
they O
approached O
the O
instrument O

" O
that O

" O
" O
It O

said O
Coningsby S-PERSON
leading O
her O
to O
the O
piano O
with O
great O
politeness O
, O

only O
with O
great O
politeness O

" O
Where O
is O
Mademoiselle B-PERSON

" O
she O
inquired O

" O

only O
tell O
me O
what O
you O
like O

" O
Coningsby S-PERSON
felt O
the O
difference O
between O
the O
courtesy O
of O
the O
head O
and O
of O
the O
heart O
, O
as O
he O
contrasted O
the O
manner O
of O
Lucretia S-PERSON

Flora S-PERSON
. O
Nothing O
could O
be O
more O
exquisitely O
gracious O
than O
the O
daughter O

was O
to O
- O
night O

Flora S-PERSON
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
was O
rather O
agitated O

embarrassed O

did O
not O
express O

readiness O
with O
half S-CARDINAL
the O
facility O

the O
grace O
of O
Lucretia S-PERSON

but O
Flora's S-PERSON
arm O
trembled O
as O
Coningsby S-PERSON
led O
her O
to O
the O
piano O
. O
Meantime O
Lord B-PERSON
Eskdale E-PERSON

in O
deep O
converse O

" O

Sidonia S-PERSON

very O
well O
the O
clime O

manners O
of O
Italy S-GPE

but O
Lucretia S-PERSON
was O
well O
aware O
that O
it O
was O
altogether O
opposed O
to O
the O
habits O
and O
feelings O
of O
this O
country O
. O
She O
had O
no O
conviction O
that O
either O
Coningsby S-PERSON
would O
wish O
to O
marry O
her O
, O
or O
if O
willing O

that O
his O
grandfather O

sanction O
such O

step O
in O
one O
as O
yet O
only O
on O
the O
threshold O
of O
the O
world O
. O
Lucretia S-PERSON
therefore O
received O
the O
suggestions O
and O
proposals O
of O
Madame B-PERSON
Colonna E-PERSON
with O
great O
coldness O
and O
indifference O

one O
might O
even O
say O
contempt O
, O
for O
she O
neither O
felt O
respect O
for O
this O
lady O
, O
nor O
was O
she O
sedulous O
to O
evince O
it O
. O
Although O
really O
younger O
than O
Coningsby S-PERSON
, O
Lucretia S-PERSON
felt O
that O
a O
woman O
of O
eighteen S-CARDINAL
is O
in O
all O
worldly O
considerations O
, O
ten B-DATE
years E-DATE
older O
than O
a O
youth O
of O
the O
same O
age O
. O
She O
anticipated O
that O
a O
considerable O
time O
might O
elapse O
before O
Coningsby S-PERSON
would O
feel O
it O
necessary O
to O
seal O
his O
destiny O
by O
marriage O
, O
while O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
she O
was O
not O
only O
anxious O
, O
but O
resolved O
, O
not O
to O
delay O
on O
her O
part O
her O
emancipation O
from O
the O
galling O
position O
in O
which O
she O
very O
frequently O
found O
herself O
. O
and O
impressions O
. O
She O
was O
not O
naturally O
communicative O
, O
and O
conversed O
with O
no O
one O
with O
less O
frankness O
and O
facility O
than O
with O
her O
step O
- O
mother O
. O
Madame O
Colonna S-PERSON
therefore O
found O
no O
reasons O
in O
her O
conversation O
with O
Lucretia S-PERSON
to O
change O
her O
determination O
. O
As O
her O
mind O
was O
not O
very O
ingenious O
she O
did O
not O
see O
questions O
in O
those O
various O
lights O
which O
make O
us O
at O
the O
same O
time O
infirm O
of O
purpose O
and O
tolerant O
. O
What O
she O
fancied O
ought O
to O
be O
done O
, O
she O
fancied O
must O
be O
done O

for O
she O
perceived O
no O
middle O
course O
or O
alternative O
. O
For O
the O
rest O
, O
Lucretia's S-PERSON
carriage O
towards O
her O
gave O
her O
little O
discomfort O
. O
Besides O
she O
herself O
though O
good O
- O
natured O
, O
was O
obstinate O
. O
Her O
feelings O
were O
not O
very O
acute O

nothing O
much O
vexed O
her O
. O
As O
long O
as O
she O
had O
fine O
dresses O
, O
good O
dinners O
, O
and O
opera O
boxes O
, O
she O
could O
bear O
her O
plans O
to O
be O
crossed O
like O
a O
philosopher O
| | O
and O
her O
consolation O
under O
her O
unaccomplished O
devices O
was O
her O
admirable O
consistency O
, O
which O
always O
assured O
her O
that O
her O
projects O
were O
wise O
, O
though O
unfulfilled O

cue O
until O

. O
Faithful O
to O
her O
first S-ORDINAL
impressions O
, O
Lucretia S-PERSON
had O
made O
no O
difference O
in O
her O
demeanour O
to O
Coningsby S-PERSON
to O
that O
which O
she O
offered O
to O
the O
other O
guests O

Polite O

uncommunicative O

ready O
to O
answer O
, O
but O
never O
originating O
conversation O

charmed O
him O
as O
little O
by O
her O
manner O
as O

her O
person O

and O
after O
some O
attempts O
not O
very O
painstaking O
to O
interest O
her O
, O
Coningsby S-PERSON
had O
ceased O
to O
address O
her O
. O
The B-DATE
day E-DATE
passed O
by O
with O
only O
a O
faint O
recognition O
between O
them O
| | O
even O
that O
sometimes O
omitted O
. O
that O
he O
seemed O
generally O
looked O
upon O
in O
the O
light O
of O
his O
grandfather's O
heir O

and O
that O
Lady B-PERSON

more O

any O

was O
heard O
more O
than O
once O
to O
regret O
that O
she O
had O
not O
brought O
another O
daughter O

her O

Clara B-PERSON
Isabella E-PERSON
as O
well O
as O
Augustina S-PERSON

the O
Princess O
Lucretia S-PERSON
began O
to O
imagine O
that O
Madame B-PERSON
Colonna E-PERSON
after O
all O
, O
might O
not O
be O
so O
extravagant O
in O
her O
purpose O
, O
as O
she O
had O
first S-ORDINAL
supposed O
. O
She O
therefore O
surprised O
Coningsby S-PERSON
with O
the O
almost O
affectionate O
moroseness O
with O
which O
, O
while O
she O
hated O
to O
sing O

she O
yet O
found O
pleasure O
in O
singing O
for O
him O
alone O

And O
it O
is O
impossible O
to O
say O
what O
might O
not O
have O
been O
the O
next O
move O
in O
her O
tactics O

this O
respect O

had O
not O
the O
very O
night O
on O
which O
she O
had O
resolved O
to O
commence O
the O
enchantment O
of O
Coningsby S-PERSON
, O
introduced O
to O
her O
Sidonia S-PERSON
. O
From O
the O
evening O
of O
his O
introduction O
, O
Sidonia S-PERSON
sought O
the O
society O
of O
the O
Princess O
Lucretia S-PERSON
. O
He O
could O
not O
complain O
of O
her O
reserve O
. O
She O
threw O
out O
her O
mind O
in O
various O
and O
highly O
cultivated O
intelligence O
. O
He O
recognised O
in O
her O
a O
deep O
and O
subtile O
spirit O
, O
considerable O
reading O
for O
a O
woman O
, O
habits O
of O
thought O
, O
and O
a O
soul O
passionate O
and O
daring O
. O
She O
resolved O
to O
subdued O
one O
whose O
appreciation O
she O
had O
gained O
, O
and O
who O
had O
subdued O
her O
. O
The O
profound O
meaning O
and O
the O
calm O
manner O
of O
Sidonia S-PERSON
combined O
to O
quell O
her O
spirit O
. O
She O
struggled O
against O
the O
spell O
. O
She O
tried O
to O
rival O
his O
power O

to O
cope O
with O
him O
, O
and O
with O
the O
same O
weapons O
. O
But O
prompt O
as O
was O
her O
thought O
and O
bright O
as O
was O
its O
expression O
, O
her O
heart O
beat O
in O
tumult O
| | O
and O
with O
all O
her O
apparent O
serenity O
, O
her O
agitated O
soul O
was O
the O
prey O
of O
absorbing O
passion O
. O
She O
could O
not O
contend O
with O
that O
intelligent O
, O
yet O
inscrutable O
, O
eye O

with O
that O
manner O
so O
full O
of O
interest O

respect O

and O
yet O
so O
tranquil O
. O
Besides O
they O
were O
not O
on O
equal O
terms O

Here O
was O
a O
girl O
contending O
with O
a O
man O

the O

way O

The B-TIME
morning E-TIME

his O
arrival O
they O
went O
out O
shooting O
together O

After O
a O
long O
ramble O
they O
would O
stretch O
themselves O
on O
the O
turf O
under O
a O
shady O
tree O

often O
by O
the O
side O
some O

added O

then O
Coningsby S-PERSON

lead O
their O

by O
which O
they O
might O
all O
win O
. O
he O
glanced O
rather O
sharply O
at O
the O
brook O
, O
and O
on O
his O
return O
to O
the O
Castle S-FAC
he O
sent O
a O
despatch O
for O
some O
of O
his O
stud O
. O
Coningsby S-PERSON
was O
all O
anxiety O
to O
win O
. O
He O
was O
proud O
of O
the O
confidence O
of O
his O
grandfather O
in O
backing O
him O
. O
He O
had O
a O
powerful O
horse O
and O
a O
first S-ORDINAL
- O
rate O
fencer O
, O
and O
he O
was O
resolved O
himself O
not O
to O
flinch O
. O
On O
the B-TIME
night E-TIME
before O
the O
race O
retiring O
somewhat O
earlier O
than O
usual O
to O
his O
chamber O
, O
he O
observed O
on O
his O
dressing O
- O
table O
a O
small O
packet O
addressed O
to O
his O
name O
, O
and O
in O
an O
unknown O
hand O
- O
writing O
. O
Opening O
it O
he O
found O
a O
very O
pretty O
jockey O
whip O
embroidered O
with O
his O
colours O
of O
pink O
and O
white O
. O
This O
was O
a O
perplexing O
circumstance O
, O
but O
he O
fancied O
it O
on O
the O
whole O
a O
happy O
omen O
. O
And O
who O
was O
the O
donor O
? O
Certainly O
not O
the O
Princess O
Lucretia S-PERSON
, O
for O
he O
had O
observed O
her O
fashioning O
some O
maroon O
ribands O
which O
were O
the O
colours O
of O
Sidonia S-GPE
. O
It O
could O
scarcely O
be O
from O
Mrs. O
Guy B-PERSON
Flouncey E-PERSON
. O
Perhaps O
Madame B-PERSON
Colonna E-PERSON
to O
please O
— O
the O
Marquess O
? O
Thinking O
over O
this O
incident O
he O
fell O
asleep O
. O
Among O
them O
was O
an O
Arab S-NORP
mare O
. O
Coningsby S-PERSON
recognised O
the B-PERSON
Daughter I-PERSON
of I-PERSON
the I-PERSON
Star E-PERSON
. O
She O
was O
greatly O
admired O
for O
her O
points O
| | O
but O
Guy O
Flouncey S-PERSON
whispered O
to O
Mr. O
Melton S-PERSON
that O
she O
never O
could O
do O
the O
work O
. O
" O
But O
Lord O
Beaumanoir S-PERSON
says O
he O
is O
all O
for O
speed O
against O
strength O
in O
these O
affairs O
, O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Melton S-PERSON
. O
Guy B-PERSON
Flouncey E-PERSON
smiled O
incredulously O
. O
The B-TIME
night E-TIME
before O
the O
race O
it O
rained O
heavily O
. O
" O
I O
take O
it O
the O
country O
will O
not O
be O
very O
like O
the O
desarts O
of O
Arabia S-GPE
, O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Guy B-PERSON
Flouncey E-PERSON
with O
a O
knowing O
look O
to O
Mr. O
Melton S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
noting O
a O
bet O
in O
his O
memorandum O
book O
. O
entries O
were O
very O
numerous O
, O
though O
it O
was O
understood O
that O
not O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
a I-CARDINAL
dozen E-CARDINAL
would O
start O
, O
and O
half S-CARDINAL
of O
these O
were O
the O
guests O
of O
Lord O
Monmouth S-PERSON
. O
At O
half B-TIME
- I-TIME
past I-TIME
one E-TIME
the O
cortège O
from O
the O
Castle S-FAC
arrived O
, O
and O
took O
up O
the O
post O
which O
had O
been O
prepared O
for O
them O
on O
the O
summit O
of O
the O
hill O
. O
Lord O
Monmouth S-PERSON
was O
very O
much O
cheered O
on O
his O
arrival O
. O
In O
the O
carriage O
with O
him O
were O
Madame B-PERSON
Colonna E-PERSON
and O
Lady B-PERSON
St. I-PERSON
Julians E-PERSON
. O
The B-PERSON
Princess I-PERSON
Lucretia E-PERSON

Lady B-PERSON
Gaythorpe E-PERSON

Mrs. O

Flouncey E-PERSON
, O
accompanied O
by O
Lord O
Eskdale S-PERSON
and O
other O
cavaliers O
, O
formed O
a O
brilliant O
company O
. O
There O
was O
scarcely O
a O
domestic O
in O
the O
Castle O
who O
was O
not O
there O
. O
The O
comedians O
indeed O
did O
not O
care O
to O
come O
, O
but O
Villebecque S-PERSON
prevailed O
upon O
Flora S-PERSON
to O
drive O
with O
him O
to O
the O
race O
in O
a O
buggy O
he O
borrowed O
of O
the O
steward O
. O
his O
bridle O
. O
In O
a O
few O
moments O
, O
the O
irrevocable O
monosyllable O
will O
be O
uttered O
. O
The O
bugle O
sounds O
for O
them O
to O
face O
about O
: O
the B-PERSON
Clerk I-PERSON
of I-PERSON
the I-PERSON
Course E-PERSON
sings O
out O
: O
" O
Gentlemen O
, O
are O
you O
all O
ready O
? O
" O
No O
objection O
made O

the O
word O
given O
to O
go O

and O
fifteen S-CARDINAL
riders O
start O
in O
excellent O
style O
. O
Prince O
Colonna S-PERSON
, O
who O
rode O
like O
Prince B-PERSON
Rupert E-PERSON
, O
took O
the O
lead O
, O
followed O
close O
by O
a O
stout O
yeoman O
on O
an O
old O
white O
horse O
of O
great O
provincial O
celebrity O
, O
who O
made O
steady O
running O
, O
and O
from O
his O
appearance O
and O
action O
, O
a O
dangerous O
customer O
. O
The O
rest O
, O
with O
two S-CARDINAL
exceptions O
, O
followed O
in O
a O
cluster O
at O
no O
great O
distance O
, O
and O
in O
this O
order O
they O
continued O
with O
very O
slight O
variation O
for O
the O
two B-QUANTITY
first I-QUANTITY
miles E-QUANTITY
, O
though O
the O
fences O
were O
frequent O
and O
one S-CARDINAL
or O
two S-CARDINAL
of O
them O
awkward O
. O
Indeed O
they O
appeared O
more O
like O
horses O
running O
over O
a O
course O
than O
over O
a O
country O
. O
The O
two S-CARDINAL
exceptions O
were O
Lord O
Beaumanoir S-PERSON
on O
his O
horse O
Sunbeam S-PRODUCT
and O
Sidonia O
on O
the O
Arab S-NORP

These O
kept O
somewhat O
slightly O
in O
the O
rear O

bed O
for O
a O
considerable O
period O
. O
In O
the O
midst O
of O
this O
turmoil O
, O
the O
Marquess S-PERSON
and O
Sidonia S-PERSON
at O
the O
same O
moment O
cleared O
the O
brook O
. O
was O
in O
his O
saddle O
again O
, O
and O
near O
at O
hand O
. O
It O
seemed O
that O
the O
Marquess S-PERSON
was O
winning O
. O
There O
was O
only O
one S-CARDINAL
more O
fence O

and O
that O
the O
foot O
people O
had O
made O
a O
breach O
in O
by O
the O
side O
of O
a O
gate O
post O
and O
wide O
enough O

as O
was O
said O
, O
for O
a O
broad O
wheel O
waggon O

travel O
by O
. O
Instead O
of O
passing O
straight O
over O
this O
gap O
, O
Sunbeam S-PERSON
swerved O
against O
the O
gate O
and O
threw O
his O
rider O

This O
was O
decisive O

Daughter I-PERSON

was O
still O
going O
beautifully O

pulling O
freely O

her O
jockey O
sitting O
still O

in O
first S-ORDINAL

Coningsby S-PERSON

Sir O

The O
distance O

was O
about B-QUANTITY
four I-QUANTITY
miles E-QUANTITY

there O
were O
thirty B-CARDINAL

done O
under O
fifteen B-TIME

observed O
on O
her O
usually O
pale O
countenance O

Villebecque S-PERSON
who O
had O
betted O

so O
extremely O
excited O
by O
the O
whole O
affair O
, O
especially O
during O
the B-TIME
last I-TIME
three I-TIME

quite O
forgot O
his O

he O
looked O
round O

found O

CHAPTER O
XV O
. O
Notwithstanding O
the O
fatigues O
of O
the O
morning O
, O
the O
evening O
was O
past O
with O
great O
gaiety O
at O
the O
castle O
. O
The O
gentlemen O
all O
vowed O
, O
that O
far O
from O
being O
inconvenienced O
by O
their O
mishaps O
, O
they O
felt O
, O
on O
the O
whole O
, O
rather O
better O
for O
them O
. O
Mr. O
Guy B-PERSON
Flouncey E-PERSON
indeed O
did O
not O
seem O
quite O
so O
limber O
and O
flexible O
as O
usual O
| | O
and O
the O
young O
guardsman O
, O
who O
had O
previously O
discoursed O
in O
an O
almost O
alarming O
style O
of O
the O
perils O
and O
feats O
of O
the O
Kildare S-GPE
country O
, O
had O
subsided O
into O
a O
remarkable O
reserve O
. O
no O
matter O
of O
what O
kind O
, O
he O
was O
to O
be O
sure O
to O
write O
to O
his O
grandfather O
, O
who O
would O
certainly O
get O
him O
out O
of O
it O
. O
" O
Your O
departure O
is O
sudden O
, O
" O
said O
the O
Princess O
Lucretia S-PERSON
in O
a O
low O
deep O
tone O
to O
Sidonia S-GPE
who O
was O
sitting O
by O
her O
side O

screened O
from O
general O
observation O

the O
waltzers O

whirled O

rather O

" O
What O

call O
the O

said O
Sidonia S-PERSON

" O
is O
a O
nervous O

He O
curiously O
meditated O
over O
the O
fact O
, O
that O
three S-CARDINAL
English S-LANGUAGE
subjects O
, O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
them O
a O
principal O
landed O
proprietor O

another O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
most O
eminent O
manufacturers O
, O
and O
the O
third S-ORDINAL
the O
greatest O
capitalist O

, O
all O
of O
them O
men O

great O
intelligence O
, O
and O
doubtless O
of O
a O
high O
probity O
and O
conscience O
, O
were O
in O
their O
hearts O
, O
disaffected O
with O
the O
political O
constitution O
of O
the O
country O
. O
Yet O
unquestionably O
these O
were O
the O
men O
among O
whom O
we O
ought O
to O
seek O
for O
some O
of O
our O
first S-ORDINAL
citizens O
. O
What O
then O
was O
this O
repulsive O
quality O
in O
those O
institutions O
which O
we O
persisted O
in O
calling O
national O
, O
and O
which O
once O
were O
so O
? O
Here O
was O
a O
great O
question O

his O
time O
in O
the O
continual O
society O
of O
refined O

charming O
women O

It O
is O
an O
acquaintance O

when O
habitual O
exercises O
a O
great O
influence O
over O
the O

even O
if O
it O
does O
not O
produce O
any O
more O
violent O
effects O
. O
It O
refines O
the O

He O
thought O
with O
disgust O
of O
the O
impending O
dissipation O
of O
an O
University S-ORG
, O
which O
could O
only O
be O
an O
exaggeration O
of O
their O
coarse O
frolics O
at O
school O
. O
It O
seemed O
rather O
vapid O
this O
mighty O
Cambridge S-GPE
over O
which O
they O
had O
so O
often O
talked O
in O
the O

with O
such O
anticipations O
of O
its O
vast O

absorbing O
interest O
. O
And O
those O
University S-ORG
honours O
that O
once O
were O
the O
great O
object O
of O
his O
aspirations O
, O
they O
did O
not O
figure O
in O
that O
grandeur O

they O
once O
haunted O
his O
imagination O
. O
What O
Coningsby S-PERSON
determined O
to O
conquer O
was O
knowledge O
. O
He O
had O
watched O
the O
influence O
of O
Sidonia S-PERSON
in O
society O
with O
an O
eye O
of O
unceasing O
vigilance O
. O
Coningsby S-PERSON
perceived O
that O
all O
yielded O
to O
him O

that O
Lord O
Monmouth S-PERSON
even O
, O
who O
seemed O
to O
respect O
none O

gave O
place O
to O
his O
intelligence O

appealed O
to O
him O
, O
listened O
to O
him O
, O
was O
guided O
by O
him O
. O
What O
was O
the O
secret O
of O
this O
influence O
? O
Knowledge O
. O
On O
all O
subjects O
his O
views O
were O
prompt O

clear O
, O
and O
this O
not O
more O
from O
his O
native O
sagacity O

Marquess O
great O
disquietude O
. O
was O
extremely O
anxious O
to O
know O
which O
way O
the O
wind O
blew O
, O
and O
the O
mission O
with O
which O
he O
had O
been O
entrusted O
, O
fell O
in O
precisely O
with O
his O
inclinations O
and O
necessities O
. O
The O
Marquess S-PERSON
listened O
to O
the O
communication O
and O
sighed O
, O
then O
turned O
gently O
round O
and O
surveyed O
himself O
in O
the O
mirror O
and O
sighed O
again O
, O
then O
said O
to O
Rigby S-PERSON
: O
" O
You O
understand O
exactly O
what O
I O
mean O
, O
Rigby S-PERSON
. O
It O
is O
quite O
ridiculous O
their O
going O
, O
and O
infinitely O
distressing O
to O
me O
. O
They O
must O
stay O
. O
" O
or O
more O
content O
, O
and O
more O
cheerful O
. O
As O
for O
the O
Marquess S-PERSON
himself O
, O
Mr. O
Rigby S-PERSON
never O
remembered O
him O
more O
serene O
and O
even O
joyous O
. O
His O
Lordship O
scarcely O
ever O
entered O
general O
society O
. O
The O
Colonna S-PERSON
family O
remained O
in O
strict O
seclusion O
| | O
and O
he O
preferred O
the O
company O
of O
these O
accomplished O
and O
congenial O
friends O
to O
the O
mob O
of O
the O
great O
world O
. O
Between O
Madame B-PERSON
Colonna E-PERSON
and O
Mr. O
Rigby S-PERSON
there O
had O
always O
subsisted O
considerable O
confidence O
. O
Now O
, O
that O
gentleman O
seemed O
to O
have O
achieved O
fresh O
and O
greater O
claims O
to O
her O
regard O
. O
In O
the O
pleasure O
with O
which O
he O
looked O
forward O
to O
her O
approaching O
alliance O
with O
his O
patron O
, O
he O
reminded O
her O
of O
the O
readiness O
with O
which O
he O
had O
embraced O
her O
suggestions O
for O
the O
marriage O
of O
her O
daughter O
with O
Coningsby S-PERSON
. O
Always O
obliging O
, O
she O
was O
never O
wearied O
of O
chaunting O
his O
praises O
to O
her O
noble O
admirer O
, O
who O
was O
apparently O
much O
gratified O
she O
should O
have O
bestowed O
her O
esteem O
on O
one O
of O
whom O
she O
would O
necessarily O
in O
after O
life O
see O
so O
much O
. O
It O
is O
seldom O
the O
lot O
of O
husbands O
that O
their O
confidential O
friends O
gain O
the O
regards O
of O
their O
brides O
. O
" O
I O
am O
delighted O
you O
all O
like O
Rigby S-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
Lord O
Monmouth S-PERSON
, O
" O
as O
you O
will O
see O
so O
much O
of O
him O
. O
" O
The O
remembrance O
of O
the O
Hellingsley S-PERSON
failure O
seemed O
to O
be O
quite O
erased O
from O
the O
memory O
of O
the O
Marquess S-PERSON
. O
Rigby S-PERSON
never O
recollected O
him O
more O
cordial O
and O
confidential O
, O
and O
more O
equable O
in O
his O
manner O
. O
He O
told O
Rigby S-PERSON
one B-DATE
day E-DATE
, O
that O
he O
wished O
that O
Monmouth B-ORG

sumptuous O

the O
most O
fanciful O
boudoir O

London S-GPE

Paris S-GPE
. O
What O
a O
hint O
for O
Rigby S-PERSON
! O
That O
gentleman O
consulted O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
artists O
, O
and O
gave O
them O
some O
hints O
in O
return O

his O
researches O
on O
domestic O
decoration O
ranged O
through O
all O
ages O

he O
even O
meditated O
a O
rapid O
tour O
to O
mature O
his O
inventions O
| | O
but O
his O
confidence O
in O
his O
native O
taste O
and O
genius O
, O
ultimately O
convinced O
him O
that O
this O
movement O
was O
unnecessary O

Act O
, O
already O
gained O
by O
the O

It O
was O
for O
some O
days O
Rigby S-PERSON

him O
hard O

obtrude O
himself O

a O
struggle O
if O

one O

so O
he O
offered O
himself O
if O

not O
find O
a O
better O
candidate O
without O
waiting O
for O
the O
ceremony O
of O
a O
requisition O

He O
was O
exactly O
the O
man O
they O
wanted O

though O
he O
had O
" O
no O

to O
his O
name O

" O
and O
was O
somewhat O
impracticable O
about O

his O
fortune O
was O
so O
great O

his O
character O
so O
high O

that O
it O
might O
be O
hoped O
that O
the O
people O
would O
be O
almost O
as O
content O
as O
if O
they O
were O
appealed O
to O
by O
some O
obscure O
scion O
of O
factitious O
nobility O

. O
the O
contagion O
of O
popular O
feeling O
, O
the O
town O
was O
divided O
into O
two S-CARDINAL
parties O
, O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
which O
were O
firmly O
convinced O
that O
the O
country O
could O
only O
be O
saved O
by O
the O
return O
of O
Mr. O
Rigby S-PERSON
, O
or O
preserved O
from O
inevitable O
destruction O
by O
the O
election O
of O
Mr. O
Millbank S-PERSON
. O
up O
their O
minds O
without O
duly O
weighing O
the O
respective O
merits O
of O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
rivals O
. O
This O
class O
of O
deeply O
meditative O
individuals O
are O
distinguished O
not O
only O
by O
their O
pensive O
turn O
of O
mind O
| | O
but O
by O
a O
charitable O
vein O
that O
seems O
to O
pervade O
their O
being O
. O
Not O
only O
will O
they O
think O
of O
your O
request O
, O
but O
for O
their O
parts O
they O
wish O
both O
sides O
equally O
well O
. O
Decision O
indeed O
, O
as O
it O
must O
dash O
the O
hopes O
of O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
their O
solicitors O
, O
seems O
infinitely O
painful O
to O
them O
| | O
they O
have O
always O
a O
good O
reason O
for O
postponing O
it O
. O
If O
you O
seek O
their O
suffrage O
during O
the O
canvass O
, O
they O
reply O
that O
the O
writ O
not O
having O
come O
down O
, O
the O
day O
of O
election O
is O
not O
yet O
fixed O
. O
If O
you O
call O
again O
to O
inform O
them O
that O
the O
writ O
has O
arrived O
, O
they O
rejoin O
that O
perhaps O
after O
all O
there O
may O
not O
be O
a O
contest O
. O
If O
you O
call O
a O
third S-ORDINAL
time O
half S-CARDINAL
dead O
with O
fatigue O
, O
to O
give O
them O
friendly O
notice O
that O
both O
you O
and O
your O
rival O
have O
pledged O
yourselves O
to O
go O
to O
the O
poll O
, O
they O
twitch O
their O
trowsers O
, O
rub O
their O
hands O
, O
and O
with O
a O
dull O
grin O
observe O
, O
" O
Well O
, O
sir O
, O

shall O
see O

an O

exclaims O
another O

that O

yet O
the O
interval O
that O
elapsed O
between B-DATE

, O

hardly O

out O

was O
most O
eloquent O
in O

praises O

" O
A O
very O
amiable O
woman O

handsome O

always O
admired O
her O

very O
agreeable O

dare O
say O

very O
good O
temper O

I O
am O
not O
going O

" O
" O
Might O
I O
then O
ask O
who O
is O

" O
replied O
the O
Marquess O
very O
quietly O
, O
and O
looking O
at O
his O
ring O
. O
Here O
was O
a O
thunderbolt O
! O
Rigby S-PERSON
had O
made O
another O
mistake O
. O
He O
had O
been O
working O
all O
this O
time O
for O
the O
wrong O
woman O
! O
The O
consciousness O
of O
being O
a O
trustee O
alone O
sustained O
him O
. O
There O
was O
an O
inevitable O
pause O
. O
The O
Marquess S-PERSON
would O
not O
speak O
however O
, O
and O
Rigby S-PERSON
must O
. O
He O
babbled O
rather O
incoherently O
about O
the O
Princess O
Lucretia S-PERSON
being O
admired O
by O
every O
body O
| | O
also O
that O
she O
was O
the O
most O
fortunate O
of O
women O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
most O
accomplished O
| | O
he O
was O
just O
beginning O
to O
say O
he O
had O
known O
her O
from O
a O
child O
, O
when O
discretion O
stopped O
his O
tongue O
, O
which O
had O
a O
habit O
of O
running O
on O
somewhat O
rashly O
| | O
but O
Rigby S-PERSON
, O
though O
he O
often O
blundered O
in O
his O
talk O
, O
had O
the O
talent O
of O
extricating O
himself O
from O
the O
consequence O
of O
his O
mistakes O
. O
" O
And O
Madame S-PERSON
must O
be O
highly O
gratified O
by O
all O
this O
? O
" O
observed O
Mr. O
Rigby S-PERSON
with O
an O
inquiring O
accent O
. O
He O
was O
dying O
to O
learn O
how O
she O
had O
first S-ORDINAL
received O
the O
intelligence O
, O
and O
congratulated O
himself O
that O
his O
absence O
at O
his O
contest O
had O
preserved O
him O
from O
the O
storm O
. O
" O
Madame O
Colonna S-PERSON
knows O
nothing O
of O
our O
intentions O
, O
" O
said O
Lord O
Monmouth S-PERSON
. O
" O
And O
by O
the O
bye O
, O
that O
is O
the O
very O
business O
on O

I O
wished O
to O
see O
you O

I O
wish O
you O

her O

We O
are O
to O
be O
married O

immediately O

would O
gratify O
me O
that O
the O
wife O

father O
should O
attend O
our O
wedding O

You O
understand O
exactly O
what O
I O
mean O

Rigby S-PERSON

I O
must O
have O
no O

happy O

then O
I O
like O

quietly O

at O
present O

harassed O

I O

been O
by O
the O
loss O

these O

all O

all O

CHAPTER O
VI O
. O
her O
development O
with O
interest O

and O
had O
witnessed O
her O
launched O
in O
that O
world O
where O
she O
floated O
at O
once O
with O
as O
much O
dignity O
and O
consciousness O
of O
superior O
power O
, O
as O
if O
she O
had O
braved O
for O
seasons O
its O
waves O
and O
its O
tempests O
. O
serpent O
| | O
indeed O
there O
was O
an O
undulating O
movement O
in O
Lucretia S-PERSON
when O
she O
approached O
you O
, O
which O
irresistibly O
reminded O
you O
of O
that O
mysterious O
animal O
. O
Lord O
Monmouth S-PERSON
was O
not O
insensible O
to O
the O
spell O
, O
though O
totally O
unconscious O
of O
its O
purpose O
. O
He O
found O
the O
society O
of O
Lucretia S-PERSON
very O
agreeable O
to O
him O
| | O
she O
was O
animated O
, O
intelligent O
, O
original O
| | O
her O
inquiries O
were O
stimulating O
| | O
her O
comments O
on O
what O
she O
saw O
, O
and O
heard O
, O
and O
read O
, O
racy O
and O
often O
indicating O
a O
fine O
humour O
. O
But O
all O
this O
was O
reserved O
for O
his O
ear O
. O
Before O
her O
parents O
as O
before O
all O
others O
, O
Lucretia S-PERSON
was O
silent O
, O
a O
little O
scornful O
, O
never O
communicating O
, O
neither O
giving O
nor O
seeking O
amusement O
, O
shut O
up O
in O
herself O
. O
which O
represented O
in O
his O
mind O
a O
continuance O
of O
good O
eating O
and O
good O
drinking O
, O
fine O
horses O
, O
luxurious O
baths O
, O
unceasing O
billiards O
. O
In O
this O
state O
of O
affairs O
appeared O
Sidonia S-PERSON
, O
known O
before O
to O
her O
step O
- O
mother O
, O
but O
seen O
by O
Lucretia S-PERSON
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
. O
Truly O
he O
came O
, O
saw O
, O
and O
conquered O
. O
Those O
eyes O
that O
rarely O
met O
anothers O
, O
were O
fixed O
upon O
his O
searching O
yet O
unimpassioned O
glance O
. O
She O
listened O
to O
that O
voice O
full O
of O
music O
, O
yet O
void O
of O
tenderness O
: O
and O
the O
spirit O
of O
Lucretia B-PERSON
Colonna E-PERSON
bowed O
before O
an O
intelligence O
that O
commanded O
sympathy O
, O
yet O
offered O
none O
. O
ever O
been O
instilled O
into O
her O
being O
. O
Frequent O
absence O
from O
her O
own O
country O
had O
by O
degrees O
broken O
off O
even O
an O
habitual O
observance O
of O
the O
forms O
of O
her O
creed O
| | O
while O
a O
life O
of O
undisturbed O
indulgence O
, O
void O
of O
all O
anxiety O
and O
care O
, O
while O
it O
preserved O
her O
from O
many O
of O
the O
temptations O
to O
vice O
, O
deprived O
her O
of O
that O
wisdom O
" O
more O
precious O
than O
rubies O
" O
which O
adversity O
and O
affliction O
, O

struggles O

sorrows O

existence O

can O
alone O
impart O

that O
required O
no O
formal O
exposition O
, O
no O
proofs O
and O
illustrations O
, O
no O
comment O
and O
no O
gloss O

which O
was O
indeed O
rather O
a O
traditional O
conviction O
than O
an O
imparted O
dogma O

that O
the O
exoterick O
public O
were O
on O
many O
subjects O
the O
victims O
of O
very O
vulgar O
prejudices O
, O
which O
these O
enlightened O
personages O
wished O
neither O
to O
disturb O
nor O
to O
adopt O
. O
A O
being O
of O
such O
a O
temper O
, O
bred O
in O
such O
a O
manner O

a O
woman O
full O
of O
intellect O
and O
ambition O
, O
daring O
and O
lawless O
, O
and O
satiated O
with O
prosperity O
, O
is O
not O
made O
for O
equable O
fortunes O
and O
an O
uniform O
existence O
. O
She O
would O
have O
sacrificed O
the O
world O
for O
Sidonia S-PERSON
, O
for O
he O
had O
touched O
the O
fervent O
imagination O
that O
none O
before O
could O
approach O
, O
but O
that O
inscrutable O
man O
would O
not O
read O
the O
secret O
of O
her O
heart O
, O
and O
prompted O
alike O
by O
pique O
, O
the O
love O
of O
power O
, O
and O
a O
weariness O
of O
her O
present O
life O
, O
Lucretia S-PERSON
resolved O
on O
that O
great O
result O
which O
Mr. O
Rigby S-PERSON
is O
now O
about O
to O
communicate O
to O
the O
Princess O
Colonna S-PERSON
. O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O
The O
sound O
even O
reached O
the O
Marquess O
in O
his O
luxurious O
recess O
, O
who O
immediately O
took O
a O
pinch O
of O
snuff O
and O
ordered O
his O
valet O
to O
lock O
the O
door O
of O
the O
ante-chamber O
. O
The O
Princess O
Lucretia S-PERSON
too O
heard O
the O
sounds O
| | O
she O
was O
lying O
on O
a O
sofa O
in O
her O
boudoir O
reading O
the O
Inferno O
and O
immediately O
mustered O
her O
garrison O
in O
the O
form O
of O
a O
French S-NORP
maid O
, O
and O
gave O
directions O
that O
no O
one O
should O
be O
admitted O
. O
Both O
the O
Marquess S-PERSON
, O
and O
his O
intended O
bride O
, O
felt O
that O
a O
crisis O
was O
at O
hand O
, O
and O
resolved O
to O
participate O
in O
no O
scenes O
. O
The O
ringing O
ceased O
| | O
there O
was O
again O
silence O
. O
Then O
there O
was O
another O
ring O
| | O
a O
very O
short O
, O
hasty O
, O
and O
violent O
pull O

followed O
by O
some O
slamming O
of O
doors O
. O
The O
servants O
, O
who O
were O
all O
on O
the O
alert O
and O
had O
advantages O
of O
hearing O
and O
observation O
denied O
to O
their O
secluded O
master O
, O
caught O
a O
glimpse O
of O
Mr. O
Rigby S-PERSON
endeavouring O
gently O
to O
draw O
back O
into O
her O
apartments O
Madame O
Colonna S-PERSON
, O
furious O
amid O
his O
deprecatory O
exclamations O

you O
— O
you O
are O
quite O
wrong O
— O
you O
are O
indeed O
— O
it O
is O
a O
complete O
misapprehension O

I O
will O
explain O
everything O

I O
entreat O

I O
implore O

whatever O
you O
like O

just O
what O
you O
please O

only O
listen O

Then O
the O
lady O
with O
a O
mantling O
visage O
and O
flashing O
eye O
, O
violently O
closing O
the O
door O

was O
again O
lost O
to O
their O
sight O

A B-TIME

was O

other O
, O
that O
if O
she O
had O
not O
been O
a O
woman O
in O
a O
passion O
, O
she O
must O
have O
detected O
that O
Rigby S-PERSON
was O
lying O
. O
He O
assured O
her O
almost O
in O
the O
same O
breath O
, O
that O
she O
was O
never O
to O
be O
separated O
from O
them O
, O
and O
that O
she O
was O
to O
have O
any O
establishment O
in O
any O
country O
she O
liked O
. O
He O
talked O
wildly O
of O
equipages O
, O
diamonds O
, O
shawls O
, O
opera O
boxes O
| | O
and O
while O
her O
mind O
was O
bewildered O
with O
these O
dazzling O
objects O
, O
he O
with O
intrepid O
gravity O
consulted O
her O
as O
to O
the O
exact O
amount O
she O
would O
like O
to O
have O
apportioned O
, O
independent O
of O
her O
general O
revenue O
, O
for O
the O
purposes O
of O
charity O
. O
so O
, O
but O
in O
consequence O
of O
her O
lengthened O
interview O
with O
Rigby S-PERSON
, O
his O
Lordship O
had O
departed O
for O
Richmond S-GPE
with O
Lucretia S-PERSON
, O
where O
he O
hoped O
that O
Madame B-PERSON
Colonna E-PERSON
and O
Mr. O
Rigby S-PERSON
would O
join O
him O
. O
So O
it O
ended O
, O
with O
a O
morning O
drive O
and O
suburban O
dinner O
| | O
Rigby S-PERSON
, O
after O
what O
he O
had O
gone O
through O
, O
finding O
no O
difficulty O
in O
accounting O
for O
the O
other O
guests O
not O
being O
present O
, O
and O
bringing O
home O
Madame B-PERSON
Colonna E-PERSON
in O
the O
evening O
, O
at O
times O
almost O
as O
gay O
and O
good O
- O
tempered O
as O
usual O
, O
and O
almost O
oblivious O
of O
her O
disappointment O
. O
When O
the O
Marquess S-PERSON
met O
Madame B-PERSON
Colonna E-PERSON
, O
he O
embraced O
her O
with O
great O
courtliness O
, O
and O
from O
that O
time O
consulted O
her O
on O
every O
arrangement O
. O
He O
took O
a O
very O
early O
occasion O
of O
presenting O
her O
with O
a O
diamond O
necklace O
of O
great O
value O
. O
The O
Marquess S-PERSON
was O
fond O
of O
making O
presents O
to O
persons O
to O
whom O
he O
thought O
he O
had O
not O
behaved O
very O
well O
, O
and O
who O
yet O
spared O
him O
scenes O
. O
party O
was O
very O
select O
, O
but O
brilliant O
as O
the O
diamond O
necklace O
: O
a O
royal O
Duke O
and O
Duchess O
, O
Lady B-PERSON
St. I-PERSON
Julians E-PERSON
, O
and O
a O
few O
others O
. O
Mr. O
Ormsby S-PERSON
presented O
the O
bride O
with O
a O
bouquet O
of O
precious O
stones O
, O
and O
Lord O
Eskdale S-PERSON
with O
a O
French S-NORP
fan O
in O
a O
diamond O
frame O
. O
It O
was O
a O
fine O
day O

Lord O
Monmouth S-PERSON

calm O
as O

Madame O

a O
grand O

awhile O

then O
they O

fell O

He O
had O
some O

There O
is O
a O
moment O
in O
life O
, O
when O
the O
pride O
and O
thirst O
of O
knowledge O
seem O
to O
absorb O
our O
being O
, O
and O
so O
it O
happened O
now O
to O
Coningsby S-PERSON
, O
who O
felt O
each O
day O
stronger O
in O
his O
intellectual O
resources O
, O
and O
each O
day O
more O
anxious O
and O
avid O
to O
increase O
them O
. O
The O
habits O
of O
public O
discussion O
fostered O
by O
the B-ORG
Debating I-ORG
Society E-ORG
were O
also O
for O
Coningsby S-PERSON
no O
inconsiderable O
tie O
to O
the O
University S-ORG

This O
was O
the O
arena O
in O
which O
he O
felt O
himself O
at O
home O
. O
The O
promise O
of O
his O
Eton B-DATE

was O
here O
fulfilled O

And O

argument O

his O
impassioned O
declamation O

the O
prompt O

the O
apt O

they O
looked O
forward O
with O
pride O
through O
the O
vista O
of O
years S-DATE
to O
the O
time O
when O
the O
hero O
of O
the O
youthful O
Club S-ORG
should O
convince O
or O
dazzle O
in O
the O
senate O

It O
is O
probable O
then O
that O
he O
would O
have O
remained O
at O
Cambridge S-GPE
with O
slight O
intervals O
until O
he O
had O
taken O
his O
degree O

had O
not O
circumstances O
occurred O
which O
gave O
altogether O
a O
new O
turn O
to O
his O
thoughts O
. O
Lord O
Monmouth S-PERSON
a O
letter O
of O
congratulation O
, O
full O
of O
feeling O
and O
ingenuousness O
, O
and O
which O
, O
while O
it O
much O
pleased O
the O
person O
to O
whom O
it O
was O
addressed O
, O
unintentionally O
convinced O
him O
that O
Coningsby S-PERSON
had O
never O
received O
his O
original O
communication O
. O
Lord O
Monmouth S-PERSON
spoke O
to O
Villebecque S-PERSON
, O
who O
could O
throw O
sufficient O
light O
upon O
the O
subject O
, O
but O
it O
was O
never O
mentioned O
to O
Lady B-PERSON
Monmouth E-PERSON
. O
The O
Marquess S-PERSON
was O
a O
man O
who O
always O
found O
out O
everything O
, O
and O
enjoyed O
the O
secret O
. O
Rather O
more B-DATE

the B-DATE

he O
had O

so O
quietly O
at O

he O
received O
a O
letter O
from O
his O
grandfather O

informing O
him O
that O
after O
a O
variety O
of O
movements O
Lady B-PERSON
Monmouth E-PERSON
and O
himself O
were O
established O
in O
Paris S-GPE
for O
the B-DATE

and O
desiring O

would O
not O
fail O
to O
come O
over O

soon O
as O
was O
practicable O

pay O
them O

long O
a O
visit O
as O
the O
regulations O
of O
the O
University S-ORG

So O
, O
at O
the O
close O
of O
the O
December S-DATE
term O
, O
Coningsby S-PERSON
quitted O
Cambridge S-GPE
for O
Paris S-GPE
. O
exact O
copy O
of O
that O
portrait O
which O
had O
so O
greatly O
excited O
his O
attention O
when O
at O
Millbank S-ORG
! O
This O
was O
a O
mysterious O
and O
singularly O
perplexing O
incident O
. O
It O
greatly O
agitated O
him O
. O
He O
was O
alone O
in O
the O
room O
when O
he O
made O
the O
discovery O
. O
When O
he O
had O
recovered O
himself O
, O
he O
sealed O
up O
the O
contents O
of O
the O
box O
, O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
his O
mother's O
letters O
and O
the O
miniature O
, O
which O
he O
took O
away O
with O
him O
, O
and O
then O
re-delivered O
it O
to O
his O
banker O
for O
custody O
until O
his O
return O

Coningsby S-PERSON
found O

His O

looked O
at O
him O
with O
marked O
attention O
, O
and O
received O
him O
with O
evident O
satisfaction O
. O
Indeed O
Lord O
Monmouth S-PERSON
was O
greatly O
pleased O
that O
Harry S-PERSON
had O
come O

the O
rest O

mere O

for O
a O
short O
time O
had O
apparently O
removed O
or O
modified O
the O
aversion O
, O
the O
manner O
of O
the O
lady O
when O
Coningsby S-PERSON
was O
ushered O
into O
her O
boudoir O
, O
resplendent O
with O
all O
that O
Parisian S-NORP
taste O
and O
luxury O
could O
devise O
, O
was O
characterized O
by O
that O
frigid O
politeness O
which O
had O
preceded O
the O
days O
of O
their O
more O
genial O
acquaintance O

If O
the O
manner O
of O
Lucretia S-PERSON
were O
the O
same O
as O
before O
her O
marriage O
, O
a O
considerable O
change O
might O
however O
be O
observed O
in O
her O
appearance O
. O
Her O
fine O
form O
had O
become O
more O
developed O

while O
her O
dress O
, O
that O
she O
once O
totally O
neglected O

was O
elaborate O

gorgeous O

at O
once O
launched O
into O
the O
most O
brilliant O
circles O
of O
Parisian S-NORP

found O
fascinating O

the O

just O
caught O
his O
form O
bowing O
to O
the O
Duchess O

instantly O
turned O
her O
head O
and O
replunged O
into O
her O
conversation O

increased O
interest O

Lady B-PERSON
Monmouth E-PERSON
was O
a O
person O
who O
had O
the O
power O
of O
seeing O
all O
about O
her O
, O
everything O
and O
everybody O
, O
without O
appearing O
to O
look O
. O
She O
was O
conscious O
that O
Sidonia S-PERSON
was O
approaching O
her O
neighbourhood O
. O
Her O
heart O
beat O
in O
tumult O

she O
dreaded O
to O
catch O
the O
eye O
of O
that O
very O
individual O
whom O
she O
was O
so O
anxious O
to O
meet O
. O
He O
was O
advancing O
towards O
the O
sofa O
. O
Instinctively O
Lady B-PERSON
Monmouth E-PERSON
turned O
from O
the O
Count O
, O
and O
began O
speaking O
earnestly O
to O
her O
other O
neighbour O
, O
a O
young O
daughter O
of O
the O
house O
, O
innocent O
and O
beautiful O
, O
not O
yet O
quite O
fledged O
, O
trying O
her O
wings O
in O
society O
under O
the O
maternal O
eye O
. O
She O
was O
surprised O
by O
the O
extreme O
interest O
which O
her O
grand O
neighbour O
suddenly O
took O
in O
all O
her O
pursuits O
, O
her O
studies O
, O
her O
daily O
walks O
in O
the B-FAC

Sidonia S-PERSON
as O
the O
Marchioness O
had O
anticipated O
, O
had O
now O
reached O
the O
sofa O
. O
But O
no O
, O
it O
was O
to O
the O
Count O
and O
not O
to O
Lady B-PERSON
Monmouth E-PERSON
that O
he O
was O
advancing O

and O
they O
were O
immediately O
engaged O
in O
conversation O

/ O
After O
some O
little O
time O
when O
she O
had O
become O
accustomed O
to O
his O
voice O
, O
and O
found O
her O
own O
heart O
throbbing O
with O
less O
violence O
, O
Lucretia S-PERSON
turned O
again O
, O
as O
if O
by O
accident O
to O
the O
Count O
, O
and O
met O
the O
glance O
of O
Sidonia S-GPE
. O
She O
meant O
to O
have O
received O
him O
with O
haughtiness O
, O
but O
her O
self O
- O
command O
deserted O
her O
| | O
and O
slightly O
rising O
from O
the O
sofa O
, O
she O
welcomed O
him O
with O
a O
countenance O
of O
extreme O
pallor O
and O
with O
some O
awkwardness O
. O
His O
manner O
was O
such O
as O
might O
have O
assisted O
her O
, O
even O
had O
she O
been O
more O
troubled O
. O
It O
was O
marked O
by O
a O
degree O
of O
respectful O
friendliness O
. O
He O
expressed O
without O
reserve O
his O
pleasure O
at O
meeting O
her O
again O
| | O
inquired O
much O
how O
she O
had O
passed O
her O
time O
since O
they O
last O
parted O
| | O
asked O
more O
than O
once O
after O
the O
Marquess S-PERSON
. O
The O
Count O
moved O
away O
| | O
Sidonia S-PERSON
took O
his O
seat O
. O
His O
ease O
and O
homage O
combined O
very O
greatly O
relieved O
her O
. O
She O
expressed O
to O
him O
how O
kind O
her O
Lord O
would O
consider O
his O
society O
, O
for O
the O
Marquess S-PERSON
had O
suffered O
in O
health O
since O
Sidonia S-PERSON
last O
saw O
him O
. O
His O
periodical O
gout O
had O
left O
him O
, O
which O
made O
him O
ill O
and O
nervous O
. O
The O
Marquess S-PERSON
received O
his O
friends O
at O
dinner O
every O
day O
. O
/ O
Sidonia O
particularly O
amiable O
, O
offered O
himself O
as O
a O
guest O
for O
the O
following O
one O
. O
" O
And O
do O
you O
go O
to O
the O
great O
ball O
to O
- O
morrow O
? O
" O
inquired O
Lucretia S-PERSON
, O
delighted O
with O
all O
that O
had O
occurred O
. O
" O
I O
always O
go O
to O
their O
balls O
, O
" O
said O
Sidonia S-PERSON
, O
" O
I O
have O
promised O

" O
There O
was O
a O
momentary O
pause O

Lucretia S-PERSON
, O
happier O
than O
she O
had O
been O
for O
a O
long O
time O
, O
her O
face O
a O
little O
flushed O
, O
and O
truly O
in O
a O
secret O
tumult O
of O
sweet O
thoughts O

remembered O
she O
had O
been O
long O
there O
, O
and O
offering O
her O
hand O
to O
Sidonia O
, O
bade O
him O
adieu O
until O
to O
- O
morrow O
. O
While O
he O
, O
as O
was O
his O
custom O
, O
soon O
repaired O
to O
the O
refined O
circle O
of O
the O
Countess O

ne O
a O
lady O
, O
whose O
manners O
he O
always O
mentioned O
as O
his O
fair O
ideal O
, O
and O
whose O
house O
was O
his O
favourite O
haunt O

Before O
to O
- O
morrow O
comes O
, O
a O
word O
or O
two S-CARDINAL
respecting O
two S-CARDINAL
other O
characters O
of O
this O
history O
connected O
with O
the O
family O
of O
Lord B-PERSON
Monmouth E-PERSON
. O
And O
first S-ORDINAL
of O
Flora S-LOC
. O
" O
La O
Petite O
" O
was O
neither O
very O
well O
nor O
very O
happy O
. O
Her O
hereditary O
disease O
developed O
itself O
| | O
gradually O
, O
but O
in O
a O
manner O
/ O
alarming O
to O
those O
who O
loved O
her O
. O
She O
was O
very O
delicate O
, O
and O
suffered O
so O
much O
from O
the O
weakness O
of O
her O
chest O
, O
that O
she O
was O
obliged O
to O
relinquish O
singing O
. O
This O
was O
really O
the O
only O
tie O
between O
her O
and O
the O
Marchioness O
, O
who O
without O
being O
a O
petty O
tyrant O
, O
treated O
her O
often O
with O
unfeeling O
haughtiness O
. O
She O
was O
therefore O
now O
rarely O
seen O
in O
the O
chambers O
of O
the O
great O
. O
In O
her O
own O
apartments O
she O
found O
indeed O
some O
distraction O
in O
music O
, O
for O
which O
she O
had O
a O
natural O
predisposition O
, O
but O
this O
was O
a O
pursuit O
that O
only O
fed O
the O
morbid O
passion O
of O
her O
tender O
soul O
. O
Alone O
, O
listening O
only O
to O
sweet O
sounds O
, O
or O
indulging O
in O
soft O
dreams O
that O
never O
could O
be O
realized O
, O
her O
existence O
glided O
away O
like O
a O
vision O
, O
and O
she O
seemed O
to O
become O
every O
day O
more O
fair O
and O
fragile O
. O
Alas O
! O
hers O
was O
the O
sad O
and O
mystic O
destiny O
to O
love O
one O
whom O
she O
never O
met O
, O
and O
by O
whom O
if O
she O
met O
him O
, O
she O
would O
scarcely O
perhaps O
be O
recognised O
. O
Yet O
in O
that O
passion O
, O
fanciful O
, O
almost O
ideal O
, O
her O
life O
was O
absorbed O
, O
nor O
for O
her O
did O
the O
world O
contain O
an O
existence O
, O
a O
thought O
, O
a O
sensation O
, O
beyond O
those O
that O
sprang O
from O
the O
image O
of O
the O
noble O
youth O
who O
had O
sympathized O
with O
her O
in O
her O
sorrows O
, O
/ O
and O
had O
softened O
the O
hard O
fortunes O
of O
dependence O
by O
his O
generous O
sensibility O
. O
Happy O
that O
with O
many O
mortifications O
, O
it O
was O
still O
her O
lot O
to O
live O
under O
the O
roof O
of O
one O
who O
bore O
his O
name O
, O
and O
in O
whose O
veins O
flowed O
the O
same O
blood O
! O
She O
felt O
indeed O
for O
the O
Marquess S-PERSON
, O
whom O
she O
so O
rarely O
saw O
, O
and O
from O
whom O
she O
had O
never O
received O
much O
notice O
, O
prompted O
it O
would O
seem O
by O
her O
fantastic O
passion O
, O
a O
degree O
of O
reverence O
, O
almost O
of O
affection O
, O
which O
seemed O
occasionally O
even O
to O
herself O
as O
something O
inexplicable O
and O
without O
reason O
. O
As O
for O
her O
fond O
stepfather O
, O
M. B-PERSON
Villebecque E-PERSON
, O
the O
world O
fared O
very O
differently O
with O
him O

His O
lively O
and O
enterprising O
genius O
, O
his O
ready O
and O
multiform O
talents O

and O
his O
temper O
which O
defied O
disturbance O
, O
had O
made O
their O
way O
. O
He O
had O
become O
the O
very O
right O
hand O
of O
Lord O
Monmouth S-PERSON

his O
only O
counsellor O

only O

the O
minister O

And O
well O
did O
Villebecque S-PERSON
deserve O
this O
trust O
, O
and O
ably O
did O
he O
maintain O
himself O
in O
the O
difficult O
position O
which O
he O
achieved O
. O
There O
was O
nothing O
which O
Villebecque S-PERSON
did O
not O
know O
, O
nothing O
which O
he O
could O
not O
do O
, O
especially O
at O
Paris S-GPE

He O
was O

of O

subject O

in O
all O
things O
the O
secret O
of O
success O

they O
may O
from O
accident O
dazzle O

the O
damning O
consciousness O

being O
charlatans O

Coningsby S-PERSON
had O
made O
a O
visit O
to O
M. B-PERSON
Villebecque E-PERSON
and O
Flora S-GPE
the O
day O
after O
his O
arrival O
. O
It O
was O
a O
recollection O
and O
a O
courtesy O
that O
evidently O
greatly O
gratified O
them O
. O
Villebecque S-PERSON
talked O
very O
much O
and O
amusingly O
| | O
and O
Flora S-PERSON
, O
whom O
Coningsby S-PERSON
frequently O
addressed O
, O
very O
little O
, O
though O
she O
listened O
with O
great O
earnestness O
. O
Coningsby S-PERSON
told O
her O
that O
he O
thought O
from O
all O
he O
heard O
she O
was O
too O
much O
alone O
, O
and O
counselled O
her O
to O
gaiety O
. O
But O
nature O
that O
had O
made O
her O
mild O
, O
had O
denied O
her O
that O
constitutional O
liveliness O
of O
being O
which O
is O
the O
graceful O
property O
of O
French S-NORP
women O
. O
She O
was O
a O
lilly O
of O
the O
valley O
, O
that O
loved O
seclusion O
, O
and O
the O
tranquillity O
of O
virgin O
glades O
. O
Almost O
every O

the O

was O
a O

notoriously O
would O
never O

the O

always O
maintained O
that O

He O
liked O

what O

more O
animated O

stirred O
. O
" O
She O
revives O
, O
" O
said O
the O
surgeon O
. O
The O
Marchioness O
breathed O
with O
some O
force O

again O
| | O
then O
half O
opened O
her O
eyes O
, O
and O
then O
instantly O
closed O
them O

" O
If O
I O
could O

get O
her O

take O
this O
draught O

the O
surgeon O
. O
" O
Stop O

moisten O
her O
lips O
first S-ORDINAL
, O
" O
said O
Sidonia S-PERSON
. O
They O
placed O
the O
draught O
to O
her O
mouth O
| | O
in O
a O
moment O
, O
she O
put O
forth O
her O
hand O
as O
if O
to O
repress O
them O
, O
then O
opened O
her O
eyes O
again O
, O
and O
sighed O
. O

Lord O
Monmouth S-PERSON

round O
to O
invite O
his O
friend O
to O
come O
forward O
. O
" O
Lady O
Monmouth S-PERSON
! O
" O
said O
Sidonia S-PERSON
in O
a O
gentle O
voice O
. O
She O
started O
, O
rose O
a O
little O
on O
the O
sofa O
, O
stared O
around O
her O

" O
Where O

I O
? O
" O
she O
exclaimed O

" O

the O
Marquess S-PERSON

he O
bent O
forward O

her O
, O

took O
her O
hand O
. O
" O

she O
again O
exclaimed O
in O
a O
voice O
of O
inquiry O

" O
Is O
here O
, O

said O
Lord O
Monmouth S-PERSON

" O

" O
" O
Accident O
! O
Why O
is O
he O
going O
to O
marry O

" O
The O
Marquess S-PERSON
took O
a O
pinch O
of O
snuff O
. O
There O
was O
an O
awkward O
pause O
in O
the O
chamber O
. O
" O
I O
think O
now O
, O

said O
Sidonia S-PERSON
to O

surgeon O
, O
" O

She O
refused O
it O

" O
Try O
you O
, O
Sidonia S-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
the O
Marquess S-PERSON
rather O
dryly O
. O
" O
You O
feel O
yourself O
again O
? O
" O
said O
Sidonia S-PERSON
, O
advancing O

with O
an O
air O
of O
stupor O
. O
" O
What O

a O
little O

Sidonia S-PERSON

The O
Marquess S-PERSON
took O
another O
pinch O
of O
snuff O
. O
" O
I O

a O
voice O

" O
My O

Lord O

looked O
at O
him O
with O
that O
irresistible O
scrutiny O

daunt O
a O
galley O

and O
then O
after O
a O
short O
pause O

CHAPTER O
VI O
. O
After O
the O
conversation O
at O
dinner O
which O
we O
have O
noticed O
, O
the O
restless O
and O
disquieted O
Coningsby S-PERSON
wandered O
about O
Paris S-GPE
, O
vainly O
seeking O
in O
the O
distraction O
of O
a O
great O
city O
some O
relief O
from O
the O
excitement O
of O
his O
mind O
. O
His O
first S-ORDINAL
resolution O
was O
immediately O
to O
depart O
for O
England S-GPE
| | O
but O
when O
, O
on O
reflection O
, O
he O
was O
mindful O
that O
after O
all O
, O
the O
assertion O
which O
had O
so O
agitated O
him O
might O
really O
be O
without O
foundation O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
many O
circumstances O
that O
to O
his O
regardful O
fancy O
seemed O
to O
accredit O
it O
, O
his O
firm O
resolution O
began O
to O
waver O
. O
Coningsby S-PERSON
had O
ever O
experienced O
| | O
and O
they O
revealed O
to O
him O
the O
immensity O
of O
the O
stake O
which O
he O
was O
hazarding O
on O
a O
most O
uncertain O
die O
. O
infinitely O
wretched O
, O
scarcely O
able O
to O
guide O
his O
steps O
, O
dreading O
even O
to O
meet O
an O
acquaintance O
, O
and O
almost O
feeling O
that O
his O
tongue O
would O
refuse O
the O
office O
of O
conversation O
, O
he O
contrived O
to O
reach O
his O
grandfather's O
hotel O
, O
and O
was O
about O
to O
bury O
himself O
in O
his O
chamber O
, O
when O
on O
the O
staircase O
he O
met O
Flora S-PERSON
. O
Coningsby S-PERSON
had O
not O
seen O
her O
for O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
fortnight E-DATE
. O
Seeing O
her O
now O
, O
his O
heart O
smote O
him O
for O
his O
neglect O
, O
excusable O
as O
it O
really O
was O
. O
Any O
one O
else O
at O
this O
time O
, O
he O
would O
have O
hurried O
by O
without O
recognition O
, O
but O
the O
gentle O
and O
suffering O
Flora S-PERSON
was O
too O
meek O
to O
be O
rudely O
treated O
by O
so O
kind O
a O
heart O
as O
Coningsby's O
. O
He O
looked O
at O
her O
| | O
she O
was O
pale O
and O
agitated O
. O
Her O
step O
trembled O
, O
while O
she O
still O
hastened O
on O
. O
" O
What O
is O
the O
matter O
? O
" O
inquired O
Coningsby S-PERSON
. O
turned O
with O
her O
| | O
but O
they O
had O
scarcely O
emerged O
from O
the O
court O
- O
yard O
when O
the O
carriage O
approached O
that O
brought O
Lord O
and O
Lady B-PERSON
Monmouth E-PERSON
home O
. O
They O
followed O
it O
into O
the O
court O
. O
They O
were O
immediately O
at O
its O
door O
. O
" O
All O
is O
right O
, O
Harry S-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
the O
Marquess S-PERSON
, O
calm O
and O
grave O
. O
Coningsby S-PERSON
pressed O
his O
grandfather's O
hand O
. O
Then O
he O
assisted O
Lucretia S-PERSON
to O
alight O
. O
" O
I O
am O
quite O
well O
, O
" O
she O
said O
, O
" O
now O
. O
" O
" O
But O
you O
must O
lean O
on O
me O
, O
dearest O
Lady B-PERSON
Monmouth E-PERSON
, O
" O
Coningsby S-PERSON
said O
in O
a O
tone O
of O
great O
tenderness O
, O
as O
he O
felt O
Lucretia S-PERSON
almost O
sinking O
from O
him O
. O
And O
he O
supported O
her O
into O
the O
hall O
of O
the O
hotel O
. O
Lord B-PERSON
Monmouth E-PERSON
had O
lingered O
behind O
. O
Flora S-PERSON
crept O
up O
to O
him O
, O
and O
with O
unwonted O
boldness O
offered O
her O
arm O
to O
the O
Marquess S-PERSON
. O
He O
looked O
at O
her O
with O
a O
glance O
of O
surprise O
, O
and O
then O
a O
soften O
expression O
, O
one O
indeed O
of O
an O
almost O
winning O
sweetness O
, O
which O
, O
though O
rare O
, O
was O
not O
a O
stranger O
to O
his O
countenance O
, O
melted O
his O
features O
, O
and O
taking O
the O
arm O
so O
humbly O
presented O
, O
he O
said O
: O
" O
Ma B-PERSON
Petite E-PERSON
, O
you O
look O
more O
frightened O
than O
any O
of O
us O
. O
Poor O
child O
! O
" O
He O
had O
reached O
the O
top O
of O
the O
flight O
of O
steps O
| | O
he O
withdrew O
his O
arm O
from O
Flora S-PERSON
, O
and O
thanked O
her O
with O
all O
his O
courtesy O
. O
" O
You O
are O
not O
hurt O
then O
, O
sir O
? O
" O
she O
ventured O
to O
ask O
with O
a O
look O
which O
expressed O
the O
infinite O
solicitude O
, O
which O
her O
tongue O
did O
not O
venture O
to O
convey O
. O
" O
By O
no O
means O
, O
my O
good O
little O
girl O
| | O
" O
and O
he O
extended O
his O
hand O
to O
her O
, O
which O
she O
reverently O
bent O
over O
and O
embraced O
. O

had O
deeply O
injured O
him O

though O
they O
really O
were O
individuals O
who O
had O
treated O
him O
with O
invariable O
kindness O
. O
But O
he O
felt O
their O
existence O
was O
a O
source O
of O
mortification O
and O
misery O
to O
him O

With O

feelings O

sauntering O
away O

of O
all O

in O
the O
gardens O
of O
the O
Luxembourg S-GPE
, O
encountered O
Sir O
Joseph B-PERSON
Wallinger E-PERSON
and O
Edith S-PERSON
. O
To O
avoid O
them O
was O
impossible O

they O
met O
face O
to O
face O

and O
Sir O
Joseph S-PERSON
stopped O
, O
and O
immediately O
reminded O
him O
that O
it O
was O
three B-DATE
days E-DATE
since O
they O
had O
seen O
him O
, O
as O
if O
to O
reproach O
him O
for O
so O
unprecedented O
a O
neglect O
. O
And O
it O
seemed O
that O
Edith S-PERSON
, O
though O
she O
said O
not O
as O
much O
, O
felt O
the O
same O
. O
And O
Coningsby S-PERSON
turned O
round O
and O
walked O
with O
them O
. O
He O
told O
them O
he O
was O
going O
to O
leave O
Paris S-GPE
on O
the O
morrow O
. O
with O
unaffected O
surprise O
, O
and O
an O
expression O
of O
disappointment O
which O
she O
in O
vain O
attempted O
to O
conceal O
. O
" O
The O
festival O
will O
be O
not O
less O
gay O
for O
my O
absence O
, O
" O
said O
Coningsby S-PERSON
with O
that O
plaintive O
moroseness O
not O
unusual O
to O
despairing O
lovers O
. O
" O
If O
we O
were O
all O
to O
argue O
from O
the O
same O
premises O

act O
accordingly O
, O
" O
said O
Edith S-PERSON
, O
" O
the O
saloons O
would O
be O
empty O

But O
if O
any O

be O
remarked O

friends O

" O
" O
He O

" O
No O

What O
are O
friends O

Traitors O

" O
Edith S-PERSON
looked O
very O
much O
astonished O
. O
And O
then O
she O
said O
: O
" O
I O
am O
sure O
you O
have O
not O

" O
And O
it O
is O
impossible O

another O
in O
higher O
terms O
than O

spoke O
of O
you O

Sir O
Joseph S-PERSON
observed O
how O
unusual O
it O
was O
for O
Monsieur B-PERSON
de I-PERSON
Sidonia E-PERSON
to O
express O
himself O
so O
warmly O
. O
" O
" O
Sidonia S-PERSON

a O
great O
man O

carries O
every O
thing O

said O
Coningsby S-PERSON

" O
I O
am O
nothing O

" O
" O
What O
field O
? O
" O
inquired O
Sir O
Joseph S-PERSON
, O
who O
did O
not O
clearly O
catch O
the O
drift O
of O
these O
observations O
. O
" O
It O
appears O
to O
me O
that O
a O
field O
for O
action O
is O
exactly O
what O
Sidonia S-PERSON
wants O
. O
There O
is O
no O
vent O
for O
his O
abilities O
and O
intelligence O
. O
He O
wastes O
his O
energy O
in O
travelling O
from O
capital O
to O
capital O
like O
a O
King's S-NORP
messenger O
. O
The B-TIME
morning E-TIME
after O
his O
fête O
he O
is O
going O
to O
Madrid S-GPE

" O
his O

thought O
that O
he O
should O
travel O

to O
St. B-GPE

they O
walked O
on O

some B-TIME

broken O
only O
by O
occasional O
monosyllables O

which O
Coningsby S-PERSON
responded O
at O
hazard O
to O
the O
sound O
remarks O
of O
Sir O
Joseph S-PERSON
. O
As O
they O

encountered O
them O

Amid O
the O
mutual O
recognitions O

Coningsby S-PERSON
was O
about O
to O
take O
his O
leave O
somewhat O
ceremoniously O

but O
Edith S-PERSON
held O
forth O
her O

said O
: O
" O
Is O

farewell O
? O
" O

The O
look O
of O
Edith S-PERSON

mournful O
and O
inquiring O

" O
We O

CHAPTER O
VIII O
. O
Sidonia S-PERSON
lived O
in O
the B-FAC
Faubourg I-FAC
St. I-FAC
Germain E-FAC
in O
a O
large O
hotel O
, O
that O
, O
in O
old O
days O
, O
had O
belonged O
to O
the O
Crillons S-PERSON
| | O
but O
it O
had O
received O
at O
his O
hands O
such O
extensive O
alterations O
, O
that O
nothing O
of O
the O
original O
decoration O
, O
and O
little O
of O
its O
arrangement O
, O
remained O
. O
that O
was O
wafted O
about O
. O
A O
gallery O
led O
from O
this O
hall O
to O
an O
inner O
hall O
of O
quite O
a O
different O
character O
| | O
fantastic O
, O
glittering O
, O
variegated O
| | O
full O
of O
strange O
shapes O
and O
dazzling O
objects O
. O
The O
roof O
was O
carved O
and O
gilt O
in O
that O
honeycomb O
style O
prevalent O
in O
the O
Saracenic S-NORP
buildings O
| | O
the O
walls O
were O
hung O
with O
leather O
stamped O
in O
rich O
and O
vivid O
patterns O
| | O
the O
floor O
was O
a O
flood O
of O
mosaic O
| | O
about O
were O
statues O
of O
negroes O
of O
human O
size O
with O
faces O
of O
wild O
expression O
, O
and O
holding O
in O
their O
outstretched O
hands O
silver O
torches O
that O
blazed O
with O
an O
almost O
painful O
brilliancy O
. O
From O
this O
inner O
hall O
, O
a O
double O
staircase O
of O
white O
marble O
, O
led O
to O
the O
grand O
suite O
of O
apartments O
. O
landscapes O
, O
or O
on O
the O
azure O
shores O
of O
Ægean O
waters O
. O
From O
the O
ceiling O
beautiful O
divinities O
threw O
garlands O
on O
the O
guests O
, O
who O
seemed O
surprised O
that O
the O
roses O
, O
unwilling O
to O
quit O
Olympus S-PRODUCT
, O
would O
not O
descend O
on O
earth O
. O
The O
general O
effect O
of O
this O
fair O
chamber O
was O
heightened O
too O
by O
that O
regulation O
of O
the O
house O
which O
did O
not O
permit O
any O
benches O
in O
the O
ball O
- O
room O
. O
That O
dignified O
assemblage O
who O
are O
always O
found O
ranged O
in O
precise O
discipline O
against O
the O
wall O
, O
did O
not O
here O
mar O
the O
flowing O
grace O
of O
the O
festivity O
. O
The O
chaperons O
had O
no O
cause O
to O
complain O
. O
A O
large O
saloon O
abounded O
in O
ottomans O
and O
easy O
chairs O
at O
their O
service O
, O
where O
their O
delicate O
charges O
might O
rest O
when O
weary O
, O
or O
find O
distraction O
when O
not O
engaged O
. O
All O
the O
world O
were O
at O
this O
fête O
of O
Sidonia S-GPE
. O
It O
exceeded O
in O
splendour O
and O
luxury O
every O
entertainment O
that O
had O
yet O
been O
given O
. O
The O
highest O
rank O
, O
even O
Princes O
of O
the O
blood O
, O
beauty O
, O
fashion O
, O
fame O
— O
all O
assembled O
in O
a O
magnificent O
and O
illuminated O
palace O
, O
resounding O
with O
exquisite O
melody O
. O
stamped O
upon O
his O
brain O
. O
Tender O
as O
were O
his O
years O
, O
when O
he O
was O
separated O
from O
her O
, O
he O
could O
yet O
recal O
the O
very O
phrases O
in O
which O
she O
deplored O
her O
isolation O
| | O
and O
there O
were O
numerous O
passages O
in O
her O
letters O
which O
alluded O
to O
it O
. O
Coningsby S-PERSON
had O
taken O
occasion O
to O
sound O
the O
Wallingers S-PERSON
on O
this O
subject O
| | O
but O
he O
felt O
assured O
from O
the O
manner O
in O
which O
his O
advances O
were O
met O
, O
that O
they O
knew O
nothing O
of O
his O
mother O
, O
and O
attributed O
the O
hostility O
of O
Mr. O
Millbank S-PERSON
to O
his O
grandfather O
solely O
to O
political O
emulation O
and O
local O
rivalries O
. O
Still O
there O
was O
the O
portrait O
and O
the O
miniature O
. O
That O
was O
a O
fact O
| | O
a O
clue O
which O
ultimately O
, O
he O
was O
persuaded O
, O
must O
lead O
to O
some O
solution O
. O
moment O
therefore O
that O
he O
found O
himself O
in O
the O
saloons O
of O
Sidonia S-GPE
, O
he O
was O
accosted O
by O
many O
whose O
notice O
was O
flattering O
| | O
but O
his O
eye O
wandered O
, O
while O
he O
tried O
to O
be O
courteous O
and O
attempted O
to O
be O
sprightly O
. O
Where O
was O
she O
? O
He O
had O
nearly O
reached O
the O
ball O
- O
room O
when O
he O
met O
her O
. O
She O
was O
on O
the O
arm O
of O
Lord O
Beaumanoir S-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
made O
her O
acquaintance O
at O
Rome S-GPE
, O
and O
originally O
claimed O
it O
as O
the O
member O
of O
a O
family O
who O
, O
as O
the O
reader O
may O
perhaps O
not O
forget O
, O
had O
experienced O
some O
kindnesses O
from O
the O
Millbanks S-PERSON
. O
There O
were O
mutual O
and O
hearty O
recognitions O
between O
the O
young O
men O
| | O
great O
explanations O
where O
they O
had O
been O
, O
what O
they O
were O
doing O
, O
where O
they O
were O
going O
. O
Lord O
Beaumanoir S-PERSON
told O
Coningsby S-PERSON
he O
had O
introduced O
steeple O
- O
chaces O
at O
Rome S-GPE
, O
and O
had O
parted O
with O
Sunbeam S-ORG
to O
the O
nephew O
of O
a O
Cardinal S-PERSON
. O
Coningsby S-PERSON
securing O
Edith's S-PERSON
hand O
for O
the O
next O
dance O
, O
they O
all O
moved O
on O
together O
to O
her O
aunt O
. O
Lady O
Wallinger S-PERSON
was O
indulging O
in O
some O
Roman S-NORP
reminiscences O
with O
the O
Marquess S-PERSON
. O
" O
And O
you O
are O
not O
going O
to O
Astrachan O
to O
- O
morrow O
? O
" O
said O
Edith S-PERSON
. O
" O
Not O
to O
- O
morrow O
, O
" O
said O
Coningsby S-PERSON
. O
" O
You O
know O
that O
you O
said O
once O
that O
life O
was O
too O
stirring O
in O
these O
days O
to O
permit O
travel O
to O
a O
man O
? O
" O
" O
I O
wish O
nothing O
was O
stirring O
, O
" O
said O
Coningsby S-PERSON
. O
" O
I O
wish O
nothing O
to O
change O
. O
All O
that O
I O
wish O
is O
, O
that O
this O
fête O
should O
never O
end O
" O
" O
Is O
it O
possible O
, O
that O
you O
can O
be O
capricious O

You O
perplex O
me O
very O
much O

" O
" O
Am O
I O
capricious O

Astrachan S-PERSON

" O
" O
It O
was O
the O
air O
of O
the O
Luxembourg S-GPE
that O
reminded O
me O
of O
the O
desart O
, O

said O
Coningsby S-PERSON
. O
Soon O
after O
this O
Coningsby S-PERSON
led O
Edith S-PERSON
to O
the O
dance O
. O
It O
was O
at O
a O
ball O
that O
he O
had O
first S-ORDINAL
met O
her O
at O
Paris S-GPE
, O
and O
this O
led O
to O
other O
reminiscences O

all O
most O
interesting O
. O
Coningsby S-PERSON
was O
perfectly O
happy O
. O
All O
mysteries O
, O
all O
difficulties O
, O
were O
driven O
from O
his O
recollection O

lived O
only O
in O
the O
exciting O
and O
enjoyable O
present O

Twenty B-CARDINAL

in O

Some O
time O
after O
this O
, O
Coningsby S-PERSON
who O
was O
inevitably O
separated O
from O
Edith S-PERSON
, O
met O
his O
host O
. O
" O
Where O
have O
you O
been O
, O
child O

said O
Sidonia S-PERSON
, O
" O
that O

" O
The O
resolute O
departure O
for O
England S-GPE

the O
morrow O

had O
already O
changed O
into O
a O

necessity O

returning O
to O
Cambridge S-GPE

In O
fact O
, O
Coningsby S-PERSON
felt O
that O
to O
quit O
Paris S-GPE

Edith S-PERSON
was O
an O
impossibility O

He O
silenced O
the O
remonstrance O

his O
conscience O
by O
the O
expedient O
of O
keeping O
a O
half O

had O
no O

Our O

about O

naturally O
of O
a O
very O

rather O
reserved O
mien O

The O
general O
character O
of O
his O
countenance O
was O
indeed O
a O
little O
stern O
, O
but O
it O
broke O
into O
an O
almost O
bewitching O
smile O
, O
and O
a O
blush O
suffused O
his O
face O
, O
as O
he O
sprang O
forward O

welcomed O
an O
individual O
about O
the O

age O

who O
had O
jumped O
off O
the O
Blenheim S-FAC

" O

Coningsby S-PERSON

" O

And O
there O
had O
seemed O
between O
them O
a O
sympathy O
so O
native O

spontaneous O
, O
creating O
at O
once O
the O
charm O
of O
intimacy O

any O
of O
the O
disenchanting O
attributes O

that O
are O
occasionally O

would O
recall O

her O

the O
expression O
of O
her O
soft O
dark O
eye O

the O
airy O
spirit O

frank O
graciousness O

the O
flattering O

was O
the O
portrait O
of O
his O
mother O
beneath O
the O
roof O

Millbank S-GPE

Coningsby S-PERSON

delicately O
touched O
upon O
the O
subject O
both O
with O
Edith S-PERSON
and O
the O
Wallingers S-PERSON
, O
but O
the O
result O
of O
his O
inquiries O
only O
involved O
the O
question O
in O
deeper O
gloom O
. O
Edith S-PERSON
had O
none O
but O
maternal O
relatives O

more O
than O
once O
she O
had O
mentioned O
this O
, O
and O
the O
Wallingers S-PERSON
on O
other O
occasions O
had O
confirmed O
the O
remark O

Coningsby S-PERSON
had O
sometimes O
drawn O
the O
conversation O
to O
pictures O
, O
and O
he O
would O
remind O
her O
with O
playfulness O
of O
their O
first S-ORDINAL
unconscious O
meeting O
in O
the O
gallery O
of O
the B-FAC
Rue I-FAC

then O
he O
remembered O
that O
Mr. O
Millbank S-PERSON
was O
fond O
of O
pictures O

then O
he O
recollected O
some O
specimens O
of O
Mr. O
Millbank's S-PERSON
collection O
, O
and O
after O
touching O
on O
several O
which O
could O
not O
excite O
suspicion O
, O
he O
came O
to O
" O

" O
Edith S-PERSON
thought O
she O
had O
heard O
it O
was O
a O
portrait O
, O
but O
she O
was O
by O
no O

certain O

and O
most O
assuredly O
was O
quite O
unacquainted O

were O
an O

with O
Sir O
Joseph S-PERSON

He O
inquired O
of O
the O
uncle O
explicity O
, O
whether O
he O
knew O
anything O
on O
the O
subject O

Sir O
Joseph S-PERSON
was O
of O
opinion O

about O

yet O
none O

them O
very O
mature O

Lord O

wished O
Coningsby S-PERSON

a O

decided O
him O

Coningsby S-PERSON

suddenly O
with O
a O
countenance O

little O
disturbed O
, O

in O
a O
low O
voice O
, O
" O
I O
was O
pleased O

Lady O

looked O
at O
him O
with O
an O
expression O

some O
perplexity O

said O

But O
now O
his O
feelings O
were O
ethereal O

He O
loved O
, O
passionately O
— O
and O
he O
loved O
in O
a O
scene O

in O
a O
society O
as O
sweet O

as O
pure O

his O

There O
was O
no O

All O
that O
he O
heard O

worthy O

fantastic O
dwellings O

among O
which O
his O
life O
now O
glided O

a O
life O
which O
their O
own O
good O

own O

made O
them O
both O

Ambition O
lost O
much O
of O
its O
splendour O

even O
his O
lofty O
aspirations O
something O
of O
their O
hallowing O
impulse O
of O
paramount O
duty O
, O
when O
Coningsby S-PERSON
felt O
how O
much O
ennobling O
delight O
was O
consistent O
with O
the O
seclusion O
of O
a O
private O
station O

and O
mused O
over O
an O
existence O
to O
be O
passed O
amid O
woods O

waterfalls O
with O
a O
fair O
hand O
locked O
in O
his O

surrounded O
by O

of O
things O
even O
sweeter O

the O
tongue O
may O
speak O
idly O

the O
eye O
is O
more O
eloquent O

often O
more O
true O
. O
Coningsby S-PERSON
looked O
up O

Lady B-PERSON
Wallinger E-PERSON
who O
had O
more O
than O
once O
announced O
, O
that O
she O
was O
going O
to O
put O
on O
her O
bonnet O
, O
was O
gone O
. O
Yet O
still O
he O
continued O
to O
talk O
trifles O

and O
still O
Edith S-PERSON
listened O
. O
" O
Of O
all O
that O
you O
have O
told O
me O
, O
" O
said O
Edith S-PERSON
, O
" O
nothing O
pleases O
me O
so O
much O
as O
your O
description O

How O
much O
I O
should O
like O

Coningsby S-PERSON

so O
ardent O

" O
You O

such O
a O
band O

Oswald S-PERSON
was O
saying O
this O
morning O

was O
no O

" O
you O

" O
We O
come O

" O
And O
yet O
they O
did O
not O
move O
. O
There O
were O
yet O
a O
few O
pencil O
touches O

tinted O

Would O
you O

me O

" O
some O
slight O
memorial O

away O

it O
hanging O
in O
my O

" O
A O
blush O
suffused O
the O
cheek O
of O
Edith S-PERSON
, O
she O
turned O
her O
head O
a O
little O
aside O
, O
as O
if O
she O
were O
arranging O
some O
drawings O

And O
then O
she O
said O
in O
a O
somewhat O
hushed O
and O
hesitating O
voice O
, O
" O
I O
am O
sure O
I O
will O
do O
so O

with O
pleasure O

A O
view O
of O
the O
Hall S-FAC
itself O

think O
that O
would O
be O
the O
best O

Where O
shall O
we O

it O
from O

decide O
in O

walk O

she O
rose O
, O

promising O
immediately O
to O
return O

left O
the O
room O

father O
of O
Edith S-PERSON
. O
A O
light O
step O
roused O
him O

she O
had O
returned O
, O
Unconsciously O
he O
greeted O
her O
with O
a O
glance O
of O
ineffable O
tenderness O

They O
went O
forth O

it O
was O
a O
grey O
, O
sultry O
day O

Indeed O
it O
was O
the O
covered O
sky O

had O
led O
to O
the O
fishing O
scheme O
of O
the O
morning O

Sir O
Joseph S-PERSON
was O
a O
very O
expert O

accomplished O
angler O

and O
the O
Darl S-PERSON
was O
renowned O
for O
its O
sport O

They O
lingered O
before O
they O
reached O
the O
terrace O

they O
were O
to O
find O
Lady B-PERSON

observing O
the O
different O
points O
of O

the O
Hall S-FAC
presented O

debating O
which O
was O
to O
form O
the O
subject O
of O
Coningsby's S-PERSON
drawing O

for O
already O
it O
was O

a O
sketch O

a O
drawing O

the O
most O
finished O
that O
the O
bright O

effective O
pencil O
of O
Edith S-PERSON

memorial O

master O

piece O

Edith S-PERSON
of O
the O
justness O
of O
his O
opinion O
. O
To O
the O
fishing O
cottage O
therefore O
they O
bent O
their O
steps O
. O
They O
emerged O
from O
the O
gardens O
into O
the O
Park S-LOC
, O
sauntering O
over O
the O
table O
land O
, O
and O
seeking O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
the O
shade O
in O
the O
soft O
but O
oppressive O
atmosphere O
. O
At O
the O
limit O
of O
the O
table O
land O
their O
course O
lay O
by O
a O
wild O
and O
winding O
path O
through O
a O
gradual O
and O
wooded O
declivity O
. O
While O
they O
were O
yet O
in O
this O
craggy O
and O
romantic O
woodland O
, O
the O
big O
, O
fervent O
drops O
began O
to O
fall O
. O
Coningsby S-PERSON
urged O
Edith S-PERSON
to O
seek O
at O
once O
a O
natural O
shelter O
| | O
but O
she O
, O
who O
knew O
the O
country O
, O
assured O
him O
that O
the O
fishing O
cottage O
was O
close O
by O
, O
and O
that O
they O
might O
reach O
it O
before O
the O
rain O
could O
do O
them O
any O
harm O
. O
low O
, O
dark O
roof O
of O
the O
fishing O
cottage O
on O
its O
banks O
. O
They O
descended O
from O
the O
woods O
to O
the O
margin O
of O
the O
stream O
, O
by O
a O
flight O
of O
turfen O
steps O
, O
Coningsby S-PERSON
holding O
Edith's S-PERSON
hand O
as O
he O
guided O
her O
progress O
. O
The O
drops O
became O
thicker O
| | O
they O
reached O
, O
at O
a O
rapid O
pace O
, O
the O
cottage O
. O
The O
absent O
boat O
indicated O
that O
Sir O
Joseph S-PERSON
and O
Oswald S-PERSON
were O
on O
the O
river O
. O
The O
cottage O
was O
an O
old O
building O
of O
rustic O
logs O
, O
with O
a O
very O
shelving O
roof O
so O
that O
you O
might O
obtain O
sufficient O
shelter O
without O
entering O
its O
walls O
. O
Coningsby S-PERSON
found O
a O
rough O
garden O
seat O
for O
Edith S-PERSON
. O
The O
shower O
was O
now O
violent O
. O
the O
stream O
| | O
a O
glowing O
light O
fell O
upon O
the O
woods O
and O
waters O
| | O
the O
perfume O
of O
trees O
and O
flowers O
and O
herbs O
floated O
around O
. O
There O
was O
a O
carolling O
of O
birds O
| | O
a O
hum O
of O
happy O
insects O
in O
the O
air O
| | O
freshness O
and O
stir O
, O
and O
a O
sense O
of O
joyous O
life O
, O
pervaded O
all O
things O

it O
seemed O
that O
the O
heart O
of O
all O
creation O
opened O
. O
Coningsby S-PERSON
, O
after O
repeatedly O
watching O
the O
shower O
with O
Edith S-PERSON
, O
and O
speculating O
on O
its O
progress O
which O
did O
not O
much O
annoy O
them O
, O
had O
seated O
himself O
on O
a O
log O
almost O
at O
her O
feet O
. O
And O
assuredly O
a O
maiden O
and O
a O
youth O
more O
beautiful O
and O
engaging O
had O
seldom O
met O
before O
in O
a O
scene O
more O
fresh O
and O
fair O
. O
Edith S-PERSON
on O
her O
rustic O
seat O
watched O
the O
now O
blue O
and O
foaming O
river O
, O
and O
the O
birch O
trees O
with O
a O
livelier O
tint O
, O
and O
quivering O
in O
the O
sunset O
air O

an O
expression O
of O
tranquil O
bliss O
suffused O
her O
beautiful O
brow O
, O
and O
spoke O
from O
the O
thrilling O
tenderness O
of O
her O
soft O
dark O
eye O
. O
Coningsby S-PERSON
gazed O
on O
that O
countenance O
with O
a O
glance O
of O
entranced O
rapture O
. O
His O
cheek O
was O
flushed O
, O
his O
eye O
gleamed O
with O
dazzling O
lustre O
. O
She O
turned O
her O
head O
, O
she O
met O
that O
glance O
, O
and O
, O
troubled O
, O
she O
withdrew O
her O
own O
. O
" O
Edith S-PERSON

" O
he O
said O

in O
a O
tone O

tremulous O

me O
call O

CHAPTER O
VI O
. O
season O
of O
meditation O
. O
Her O
heart O
was O
still O
agitated O
by O
the O
tremulous O
admission O
that O
she O
responded O
to O
that O
fervent O
and O
adoring O
love O
whose O
eloquent O
music O
still O
sounded O
in O
her O
ear O
, O
and O
the O
pictures O
of O
whose O
fanciful O
devotion O
flitted O
over O
her O
agitated O
vision O
. O
Unconsciously O
she O
pressed O
the O
arm O
of O
Coningsby S-PERSON
as O
the O
servant O
spoke O
, O
and O
then O
without O
looking O
into O
his O
face O
, O
whispering O
him O
to O
be O
quick O
, O
she O
sprang O
away O
. O
As O
for O
Coningsby S-PERSON
, O
notwithstanding O
the O
elation O
of O
his O
heart O
, O
and O
the O
ethereal O
joy O
which O
flowed O
in O
all O
his O
veins O
, O
the O
name O
of O
Mr. O
Millbank S-PERSON
sounded O
something O
like O
a O
knell O
. O
However O
this O
was O
not O
the O
time O
to O
reflect O
. O
He O
obeyed O
the O
hint O
of O
Edith S-PERSON
| | O
made O
the O
most O
rapid O
toilette O
that O
ever O
was O
consummated O
by O
a O
happy O
lover O
, O
and O
in O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes E-TIME
entered O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
of O
Hellingsley S-PERSON
| | O
to O
encounter O
the O
gentleman O
whom O
he O
hoped O
by O
some O
means O
or O
other O
, O
quite O
inconceivable O
, O
might O
some O
day O
be O
transformed O
into O
his O
father O
- O
in O
- O
law O
, O
and O
the O
fulfilment O
of O
his O
consequent O
duties O
towards O
whom O
he O
had O
commenced O
by O
keeping O
him O
waiting O
for O
dinner O
. O
extending O
his O
hand O
to O
Coningsby S-PERSON
. O
" O
You O
seem O
to O
have O
taken O
a O
long O
walk O
. O
" O
Coningsby S-PERSON
looked O
round O
to O
the O
kind O
Lady O
Wallinger S-PERSON
, O
and O
half O
addressed O
his O
murmured O
answer O
to O
her O
, O
explaining O
how O
they O
had O
lost O
her O
, O
and O
their O
way O
, O
and O
were O
caught O
in O
a O
storm O
or O
a O
shower O
, O
which O
as O
it O
terminated O
about B-TIME
three I-TIME
hours E-TIME
back O
, O
and O
the O
fishing O
cottage O
was O
little O
more O
than O
a O
mile O
from O
the O
Hall S-FAC
, O
very O
satisfactorily O
accounted O
for O
their O
not O
being O
in O
time O
for O
dinner O
. O
who O
in O
turn O
are O
devoted O
to O
him O
, O
making O
a O
great O
and O
inconvenient O
effort O
to O
reach O
them O
by O
dinner O
time O
| | O
to O
please O
and O
surprise O
them O
| | O
and O
finding O
them O
all O
dispersed O
, O
dinner O
so O
late O
, O
that O
he O
might O
have O
reached O
home O
in O
good O
time O
without O
any O
great O
inconvenient O
effort O
, O
his O
daughter O
whom O
he O
has O
wished O
a B-CARDINAL
thousand E-CARDINAL
times O
to O
embrace O
, O
taking O
a O
singularly O
long O
ramble O
with O
no O
other O
companion O
than O
a O
young O
gentleman O
, O
whom O
he O
did O
not O
exactly O
expect O
to O
see O
| | O
all O
these O
are O
circumstances O
individually O
perhaps O
slight O
, O
and O
yet O
encountered O
collectively O
, O
it O
may O
be O
doubted O
whether O
they O
would O
not O
a O
little O
ruffle O
even O
the O
sweetest O
temper O
. O
his O
niece O
. O
Coningsby S-PERSON
put O
his O
arm O
round O
the O
astonished O
neck O
of O
Oswald S-PERSON
as O
if O
they O
were O
once O
more O
in O
the O
playing O
fields O
of O
Eton S-GPE
. O
" O
By O
Jove S-PERSON
! O
my O
dear O
fellow O
, O
" O
he O
exclaimed O
, O
" O
I O
am O
so O
sorry O
we O
kept O
your O
father O
for O
dinner O
. O
" O
him O
. O
On O
the O
whole O
, O
affairs O
went O
on O
flowingly O
enough O
. O
The O
gentlemen O
indeed O
stayed O
much O
longer O
over O
their O
wine O
than O
on O
the B-DATE
preceding I-DATE
days E-DATE
, O
and O
Coningsby S-PERSON
did O
not O
venture O
on O
the O
liberty O
of O
quitting O
the O
room O
before O
his O
host O
. O
It O
was O
as O
well O
. O
Edith S-PERSON
required O
repose O
. O
She O
tried O
to O
seek O
it O
on O
the O
bosom O
of O
her O
aunt O
, O
as O
she O
breathed O
to O
her O
the O
delicious O
secret O
of O
her O
life O
. O
When O
the O
gentlemen O
returned O
to O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
, O
the O
ladies O
were O
not O
there O
. O
This O
rather O
disturbed O
Mr. O
Millbank S-PERSON
again O
| | O
he O
had O
not O
seen O
enough O
of O
his O
daughter O
| | O
he O
wished O
to O
hear O
her O
sing O
. O
But O
Edith S-PERSON
managed O
to O
reappear O
| | O
and O
even O
to O
sing O
. O
Then O
Coningsby S-PERSON
went O
up O
to O
her O
and O
asked O
her O
to O
sing O
the O
song O
of O
the B-WORK_OF_ART
Girls I-WORK_OF_ART
of I-WORK_OF_ART
Granada E-WORK_OF_ART
. O
She O
said O
in O
a O
low O
voice O
, O
and O
with O
a O
fond O
yet O
serious O
look O
, O
" O
I O
am O
not O
in O
the O
mood O
for O
such O
a O
song O
, O
but O
if O
you O
wish O
me O
— O
" O
solemn O
and O
even O
troubled O
expression O
of O
her O
countenance O
a O
moment O
afterwards O
. O
The O
day O
was O
about O
to O
die O
| | O
the O
day O
the O
most O
important O
, O
the O
most O
precious O
, O
in O
the O
lives O
of O
Harry B-PERSON
Coningsby E-PERSON
and O
Edith B-PERSON
Millbank E-PERSON
. O
Words O
had O
been O
spoken O
, O
vows O
breathed O
, O
which O
were O
to O
influence O
their O
careers O
for O
ever O
. O
For O
them O
hereafter O
there O
was O
to O
be O
but O
one S-CARDINAL
life O
, O
one S-CARDINAL
destiny O
, O
one S-CARDINAL
world O
. O
Each O
of O
them O
was O
still O
in O
such O
a O
state O
of O
tremulous O
excitement O
, O
that O
neither O
had O
found O
time O
or O
occasion O
to O
ponder O
over O
the O
mighty O
result O
. O
They O
both O
required O
solitude O

they O
both O
longed O
to O
be O
alone O
. O
Coningsby S-PERSON
rose O
to O
depart O
. O
He O
pressed O
the O
soft O
hand O
of O
Edith S-PERSON
, O
and O
his O
glance O
spoke O
his O
soul O
. O
" O
We O
shall O
see O
you O
at O
breakfast O
to O
- O
morrow O
, O
Coningsby S-PERSON
! O
" O
said O
Oswald S-PERSON
, O
very O
loud O
, O
knowing O
that O
the O
presence O
of O
his O
father O
would O
make O
Coningsby S-PERSON
hesitate O
about O
coming O
. O
Edith's S-PERSON
heart O
fluttered O

but O
she O
said O
nothing O
. O
It O
was O
with O
delight O
she O
heard O
her O
father O
, O
after O
a O
moment's O
pause O
, O
say O
, O
" O
Oh O
! O
I O
beg O
we O
may O
have O
that O
pleasure O

" O
" O
but O
if O
you O
will O
permit O
me O
, O
I O
hope O
to O
have O
the O
pleasure O
of O
hearing O
from O
you O
to O
- O
morrow O
, O
sir O

your O
journey O

To O
be O

could O
not O

of O
coining O
common O

place O
courtesy O
, O
when O
his O
heart O
was O
gushing O
with O
rapture O

this O
was O
a O
great O
relief O
for O
Coningsby S-PERSON
, O
though O
gained O
by O
a O
separation O
from O
Edith S-PERSON
. O
He O
turned O
to O
gaze O
upon O
the O
moonlit O
towers O
and O
peaked O
roofs O
of O
Hellingsley S-GPE
. O
Silent O
and O
dreamlike O
, O
the O
picturesque O
pile O
rested O
on O
its O
broad O
terrace O
flooded O
with O
the O
silver O
light O
, O
and O
surrounded O
by O
the O
quaint O
bowers O
of O
its O
fantastic O
gardens O
tipped O
by O
the O
glittering O
beam O
. O
Half O
hid O
in O
deep O
shadow O
, O
half S-CARDINAL
sparkling O
in O
the O
mid-night O
blaze O
, O
he O
recognized O
the O
oriel O
window O
that O
had O
been O
the O
subject O
of O
the O
morning's O
sketch O
. O
Almost O
he O
wished O
there O
should O
be O
some O
sound O
to O
assure O
him O
of O
his O
reality O
. O
But O
nothing O
broke O
the O
all O
- O
pervading O
stillness O

Was O
his O
life O
to O
be O
as O
bright O

as O
tranquil O
? O
And O
what O
was O
to O
be O
his O
life O
? O
Whither O
was O
he O
to O
bear O
the O
beautiful O
bride O

gates O

were O
to O
greet O
her O
? O
How O
long O
would O
they O
greet O
him O
after O
the O
achievement O
of O
the B-TIME
last I-TIME
four I-TIME

twenty I-TIME
hours E-TIME

Was O
this O
the O
return O
for O
the O
confiding O
kindness O
of O
his O
grandsire O
? O
That O

should O
pledge O
his O
troth O
to O
the O
daughter O

Away O

Does O
not O

energy O
divine O

carve O
out O

The O
morning O

the O

have O
become O
black O
and O
almost O
stagnant O

the O
terraces O
of O
Hellingsley S-GPE
looked O
like O
the O
hard O
lines O
of O
a O
model O

and O
the O

itself O

Before O

Hall S-FAC
, O
the O
elder O
Millbank S-PERSON
, O
with O
an O
air O
of O
some O
anxiety O
, O
surveyed O
the O
landscape O
and O
the O
heavens O
, O
as O
if O
he O
were O
speculating O
on O
the O

raised O

before O
him O

The O
clock O
of O
Hellingsley S-GPE

had O
given O
the O
chimes O
of O
noon S-TIME
. O
His O
son O
and O
Coningsby S-PERSON
appeared O
at O
the O
end O
of O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
avenues O
. O
His O
eye O
lightened O

his O
lip O
became O
compressed O

he O
advanced O
to O
meet O
them O

" O
Are O
you O
going O
to O
fish O
to O
- O
day O

Oswald S-PERSON
? O
" O
he O
inquired O
of O
his O

" O
We O
had O

" O
A O
fine O
day O
for O

he O
observed O
as O
he O
turned O
towards O
the O
Hall O
with O
them O

Coningsby S-PERSON
remarked O

Oswald S-PERSON

" O
I O
was O
much O
struck O
with O
the O
valley O

the O
whole O
settlement O
when O
I O
first S-ORDINAL
saw O
it O

said O
Coningsby S-PERSON

" O
Suppose O

go O

about O

" O

will O
take O
a O
stroll O
on O

" O
The O
habit O
of O
obedience O
which O
was O
supreme O
in O
this O
family O
instantly O
carried O
Oswald S-PERSON
away O
, O
though O
he O
was O
rather O
puzzled O
why O
his O
father O
should O
be O
so O
particularly O
anxious O
about O
the O
preparation O
of O
the O
fishing O
tackle O
, O
as O
he O
very O
rarely O
used O
it O
. O
His O
son O
had O
no O
sooner O
departed O
than O
Mr. O
Millbank S-PERSON
turned O
to O
Coningsby S-PERSON
and O
said O
very O
abruptly O
. O
pointing O
to O
a O
chair O
, O
he O
begged O
his O
guest O
to O
be O
seated O
. O
Both O
in O
their O
chairs O
, O
Mr. O
Millbank S-PERSON
clearing O
his O
throat O
, O
said O
without O
preface O
, O
" O
I O
have O
reason O
to O
believe O
, O
Mr. O
Coningsby S-PERSON
, O
that O
you O
are O
attached O
to O
my O
daughter O
. O
" O
" O
I O
have O
been O
attached O
to O
her O
for O
a O
long O
time O

most O
ardently O
, O
" O
replied O
Coningsby S-PERSON
in O
a O
calm O
and O
rather O
measured O
tone O
, O
but O
looking O
very O
pale O
. O
" O
And O
I O
have O
reason O
to O
believe O
that O
she O
returns O
your O
attachment O
, O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Millbank S-PERSON
. O
" O
I O
believe O
she O
deigns O
— O
not O
to O
disregard O
it O
, O
" O
said O
Coningsby S-PERSON
, O
his O
white O
cheek O
becoming O
scarlet O
. O
" O
It O
is O
then O
a O
mutual O
attachment O
, O
which O
if O
cherished O
, O
must O
produce O
mutual O
unhappiness O
, O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Millbank S-PERSON
. O
" O
I O
would O
fain O
believe O
the O
reverse O
, O
" O
said O
Coningsby S-PERSON
. O
" O
Why O
? O
" O
inquired O
Mr. O
Millbank S-PERSON
. O
" O
Because O
I O
believe O
she O
possesses O
every O
charm O
, O
quality O
and O
virtue O
, O
that O
can O
bless O
man O

and O
because O
, O
though O
I O
can O
make O
her O
no O
equivalent O
return O
, O
I O
have O
a O
heart O
, O
if O
I O
know O
myself O
, O
that O
would O
struggle O
to O
deserve O
her O
. O
" O
" O
I O
know O
you O
to O
be O

man O
of O
sense O

I O
believe O
you O
to O
be O
a O
man O
of O
honour O
, O
" O
replied O
Mr. O
Millbank S-PERSON
. O
" O
As O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
, O
you O
must O
feel O
that O
an O
union O
between O
you O
and O
my O
daughter O
is O
impossible O
| | O
what O
then O
should O
be O
your O
duty O
as O
a O
man O
of O
correct O
principle O
is O
obvious O
. O
" O
" O
I O
could O
conceive O
that O
our O
union O
might O
be O
attended O
with O
difficulties O
, O
" O
said O
Coningsby S-PERSON
in O
a O
somewhat O
deprecating O
tone O
. O
" O
Sir O
, O
it O
is O
impossible O
, O
" O
repeated O
Mr. O
Millbank S-PERSON
interrupting O
him O
though O
not O
with O
harshness O
, O
" O
that O
is O
to O
say O
there O
is O
no O
conceivable O
marriage O
which O
could O
be O
effected O
at O
greater O
sacrifices O
, O
and O
which O
would O
occasion O
greater O
misery O
. O
" O
" O
The O
sacrifices O
are O
more O
apparent O
to O
me O
than O
the O
misery O
, O
" O
said O
Coningsby S-PERSON
, O
" O
and O
even O
they O
may O
be O
imaginary O
. O
" O
others O
. O
But O
for O
these O
very O
reasons O
his O
hate O
is O
more O
intense O
. O
I O
can O
afford O
to O
hate O
him O
less O
than O
he O
hates O
me O
— O
I O
have O
injured O
him O
more O
. O
Here O
are O
feelings O
to O
exist O
between O
human O
beings O
! O
But O
they O
do O
exist O
— O
and O
now O
you O
are O
to O
go O
to O
this O
man O
, O
and O
ask O
his O
sanction O
to O
marry O
my O
daughter O
! O
" O
" O
But O
I O
would O
appease O
these O
hatreds O
| | O
I O
would O
allay O
these O
dark O
passions O
, O
the O
origin O
of O
which O
I O
know O
not O
, O
but O
which O
never O
could O
justify O
the O
end O
, O
and O
which O
lead O
to O
so O
much O
misery O
. O
I O
would O
appeal O
to O
my O
grandfather O
— O
I O
would O
show O
him O
Edith S-PERSON

" O
people O

free O
from O

bad O
passions O

ignorant O
of O
the O
world's O
ways O

But O
because O
they O
were O
not O
noble O
, O
because O
they O
could O
trace O
no O
mystified O
descent O
from O
a O
foreign O
invader O
or O
the O
sacrilegious O
minion O
of O
some O
spoliating O
despot O
, O
their O
daughter O

hunted O
from O

should O

exulted O

receive O
her O
, O
and O
the O

of O

she O
was O
the O
native O
ornament O
. O
Why O
should O
a O
happier O

await O
you O
than O
fell O
to O

was O
ever O
a O
bright O
form O

animated O

energy O

heart O

I O
first S-ORDINAL
made O
many O
of O
those O
discoveries O

entered O
into O
many O
of O
those O
speculations O
, O
that O
have O
since O
been O
the O
foundation O
of O
my O
wide O
prosperity O

I O
should O
bear O
her O
to O
the O
home O
that O
I O
had O
proudly O
prepared O
for O
her O
. O
" O
There O
came O
a O
young O
noble O
, O
a O
warrior O
who O
had O
never O
seen O
war O
, O
glittering O
with O
gew O

He O
was O
quartered O
in O
the O
town O

the O
mistress O

my O

who O
was O
soon O
to O
share O
my O
life O

my O
fortunes O

resided O
. O
The O
tale O
is O
too O
bitter O
not O
to O
be O
brief O
. O
He O
saw O
her O
, O
he O
sighed O

I O
will O
hope O
that O
he O
loved O
her O

she O
gave O
him O
with O
rapture O
the O
heart O
which O
perhaps O
she O
found O
she O
had O
never O
given O
me O

instead O
of O
bearing O
the O
name O

had O
once O
hoped O
to O

called O

faith O

Proceeding O
down O
the O

his O
countenance O
lost O

a O
wild O
abstraction O

Coningsby S-PERSON
encountered O
Oswald B-PERSON
Millbank E-PERSON

He O
stopped O
, O
collected O
his O
turbulent O
thoughts O
, O
and O
throwing O
on O
Oswald S-PERSON
one S-CARDINAL
glance O
that O
seemed O
at O
the O
same O
time O
to O
communicate O
woe O

to O
demand O
sympathy O
, O
flung O
himself O
into O
his O
arms O

" O
My O
friend O

he O
exclaimed O
, O

added O
in O
a O
broken O
voice O
, O
" O
I O
need O
a O
friend O

" O
consolation O
, O
by O
the O
friend O

was O
devoted O
to O
him O

to O
desert O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
his O
lonely O

unsolaced O
woe O

" O
I O
ought O
not O

Oswald S-PERSON

the O
hand O

hesitated O

" O
The B-TIME
morning E-TIME
passed O
away O
in O
unceasing O
yet O
fruitless O
speculation O
on O
the O
future O
. O
One B-TIME
moment E-TIME
something O
was O
to O
happen O
, O
the O
next O
nothing O
could O
occur O
. O
Sometimes O
a O
beam O
of O
hope O
flashed O
over O
the O
fancy O
of O
Coningsby S-PRODUCT
, O
and O
jumping O
up O
from O
the O
turf O
, O
on O
which O
they O
were O
reclining O
, O
he O
seemed O
to O
exult O
in O
his O
renovated O
energies O
| | O
and O
then O
this O
sanguine O
paroxysm O
was O
succeeded O
by O
a O
fit O
of O
depression O
so O
dark O
and O
dejected O
, O
that O
nothing O
but O
the O
presence O
of O
Oswald S-PERSON
seemed O
to O
prevent O
Coningsby S-PERSON
from O
flinging O
himself O
into O
the O
waters O
of O
the O
Darl S-PERSON
. O
that O
no O
suspicion O
might O
arise O
in O
the O
mind O
of O
his O
father O
of O
his O
having O
accompanied O
Coningsby S-PERSON
home O
. O
But O
just O
as O
he O
was O
beginning O
to O
mention O
the O
necessity O
of O
his O
departure O
, O
a O
flash O
of O
lightning O
seemed O
to O
transfix O
the O
heavens O
. O
The O
sky O
was O
very O
dark O
| | O
though O
studded O
here O
and O
there O
with O
dingy O
sports O
. O
The O
young O
men O
sprang O
up O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O
" O
We O
had O
better O
get O
out O
of O
these O
trees O
, O
" O
said O
Oswald S-PERSON
. O
" O
We O
had O
better O
get O
to O
the O
Castle O
, O
" O
said O
Coningsby S-PERSON
. O
A O
clap O
of O
thunder O
that O
seemed O
to O
make O
the O
park O
quake O
broke O
over O
their O
heads O
, O
followed O
by O
some O
thick O
drops O
. O
The O
Castle S-FAC
was O
close O
at O
hand O
| | O
Oswald S-PERSON
had O
avoided O
entering O
it O
| | O
but O
the O
impending O
storm O
was O
so O
menacing O
, O
that O
hurried O
on O
by O
Coningsby S-PERSON
he O
could O
make O
no O
resistance O
| | O
and O
in O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes E-TIME
, O
the O
companions O
were O
watching O
the O
tempest O
from O
the O
windows O
of O
a O
room O
in O
Coningsby B-FAC
Castle E-FAC
. O
broke O
over O
the O
Castle O
as O
if O
the O
keep O
were O
rocking O
with O
artillery O
: O
amid O
the O
momentary O
pauses O
of O
the O
explosion O
, O
the O
rain O
was O
heard O
descending O
like O
dissolving O
water O
- O
spouts O
. O
Nor O
was O
this O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
those O
transient O
tempests O
that O
often O
agitate O
the O
summer O
. O
Time O
advanced O
, O
and O
its O
fierceness O
was O
little O
mitigated O
. O
Sometimes O
there O
was O
a O
lull O
, O
though O
the O
violence O
of O
the O
rain O
never O
appeared O
to O
diminish O
| | O
but O
then O
as O
in O
some O
pitched O
fight O
between O
contending O
hosts O
, O
when O
the O
fervour O
of O
the O
field O
seems O
for O
a O
moment O
to O
allay O
, O
fresh O
squadrons O
arrive O
and O
renew O
the O
hottest O
strife O
, O
so O
a O
low O
moaning O
wind O
that O
was O
now O
at O
intervals O
faintly O
heard O
, O
bore O
up O
a O
great O
reserve O
of O
electric O
vapour O
, O
that O
formed O
as O
it O
were O
into O
field O
, O
in O
the O
space O
between O
the O
Castle S-FAC
and O
Hellingsley S-GPE
, O
and O
then O
discharged O
its O
violence O
on O
that O
fated O
district O
. O
Coningsby S-PERSON
and O
Oswald S-PERSON
exchanged O
looks O
. O
" O
You O
must O
not O
think O
of O
going O
home O

said O
the O

" O
The O
servant O
entered O
the O
room O
, O
and O
inquired O
whether O
the O
gentlemen O
were O
ready O
for O
dinner O

" O

all O
means O

us O
drown O
our O
cares O

" O
Coningsby S-PERSON
in O
fact O
was O
exhausted O
by O
all O
the O
agitation O
of O
the O
day O
, O
and O
all O
the O
harassing O
spectres O
of O
the O
future O

He O
found O
wine O
a O
momentary O
solace O
. O
He O
ordered O
the O
servants O
away O
, O
and O
for O
a O
moment O
felt O
a O
degree O
of O
wild O
satisfaction O
in O
the O
company O
of O
the O
brother O
of O
Edith S-PERSON

Thus O
they O
sate O
for O
a O
long O
time O
, O
talking O
only O
of O
one S-CARDINAL
subject O
, O
and O
repeating O
almost O
the O
same O
things O
, O
yet O
both O
felt O
happier O

risen O

II O
. O
she O

really O
too O
well O

was O

strong O

neglect O

in O

Mr. O

felt O
it O

indeed O
had O
been O
his O
absence O
from O
Hellingsley S-PERSON

unquestionably O
his O
presence O
might O
have O
prevented O
the O
catastrophe O
. O
Oswald S-PERSON
should O
have O
hindered O
all O
this O
. O
And O
yet O
Mr. O
Millbank S-PERSON
could O
not O
shut O
his O
eyes O
to O
the O
devotion O
of O
his O
son O

Coningsby S-PERSON

He O
felt O

could O
count O

no O

Yet O
how O
hard O
upon O
him O
that O
he O

seem O
to O
figure O

despot O

his O
own O
children O

he O
loved O

he O
had O
absolutely O
acted O
in O
an O
inevitable O
manner O

Edith S-PERSON
seemed O
sad O

Oswald S-PERSON
sullen O

all O
was O
changed O

all O
his O
life O

seemed O
to O
be O
frustrated O

And O
why O
? O
Because O
a O
young O
man O
had O
made O
love O
to O
his O
daughter O

who O
was O
really O
in O
no O

he O
might O
have O
recognised O
a O
more O
satisfactory O
reason O
for O
the O
transient O
liveliness O

his O

therefore O
peculiarly O

her O
casual O

to O
believe O

there O

In O

Edith S-PERSON

Yet O
it O
was O
fated O
that O
this O
step O
should O
not O
be O
taken O
, O
for O
while O
he O
was O
at O
breakfast O
, O
his O
servant O
brought O
him O
a O
letter O
from O
Monmouth B-ORG

apprising O
him O
that O
his O

CHAPTER O
III O
. O
Lord O
Monmouth S-PERSON
was O
sitting O
in O
the O
same O
dressing O
- O
room O
in O
which O
he O
was O
first S-ORDINAL
introduced O
to O
the O
reader O
| | O
on O
the O
table O
were O
several O
packets O
of O
papers O
that O
were O
open O
and O
in O
course O
of O
reference O
| | O
and O
he O
dictated O
his O
observations O
to O
Monsieur B-PERSON
Villebecque E-PERSON
who O
was O
writing O
at O
his O
left O
hand O
. O
Thus O
were O
they O
occupied O
, O
when O
Coningsby S-PERSON
was O
ushered O
into O
the O
room O
. O
" O
You O
see O
, O
Harry S-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
Lord O
Monmouth S-PERSON
, O
" O
that O
I O
am O
much O
occupied O
to O
- O
day O
, O
yet O
the O
business O
on O
which O
I O
wish O
to O
communicate O
with O
you O
is O
so O
pressing O
that O
it O
could O
not O
be O
postponed O
. O
" O
He O
made O
a O
sign O
to O
Villebecque S-PERSON
, O
and O
his O
secretary O
instantly O
retired O
. O
against O
a O
Coningsby S-PRODUCT
. O
They O
have O
thought O
of O
you O
as O
the O
fit O
person O
, O
and O
I O
have O
approved O
of O
the O
suggestion O
. O
You O
will O
therefore O
be O
the O
candidate O
for O
Darlford S-PERSON
with O
my O
entire O
sanction O

support O
, O
and O
I O
have O
no O
doubt O
you O
will O
be O
successful O
. O
You O
may O
be O
sure O
I O
shall O
spare O
nothing O
: O
and O
it O
will O
be O
very O
gratifying O
to O
me O
, O
after O
being O
robbed O
of O
all O
our O
boroughs O
, O
that O
the O
only O
Coningsby S-PERSON
who O
cares O
to O

should O
nevertheless O
be O
able O

who O
were O
at O
this O

" O

" O
" O
Don't O

said O
Coningsby S-PERSON
, O
" O
that O
such O
an O
announcement O
would O
be O
rather O
premature O

CHAPTER O

. O
achieved O
. O
This O
was O
always O
the O
portion O
of O
Mr. O
Rigby S-PERSON
. O
In O
the O
eye O
of O
the O
world O
he O
had O
constantly O
the O
appearance O
of O
being O
mixed O
up O
with O
high O
dealings O
, O
and O
negotiations O
and O
arrangements O
of O
fine O
management O

where O
— O
as O
in O
truth O
, O
notwithstanding O
his O
splendid O
livery O

the O
airs O
he O
gave O
himself O
in O
the O
servants' O
hall O

his O
real O
business O
in O
life O
had O
ever O
been O
— O
to O
do O
the O
dirty O
work O

against O
that O
spirit O
of O
Reform O
of O
which O
they O
had O
alike O
been O
victims O
, O
supplied O
him O
with O
information O
which O
nothing O
but O
a O
breach O
of O
ministerial O
duty O
could O
have O
furnished O
. O
The O
prophetic O
peroration O
as O
to O
the O
irresistible O
progress O
of O
Democracy O
was O
almost O
as O
powerful O
as O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
Rigby's S-PERSON
speeches O
on O
Aldborough S-GPE
or O
Amersham S-GPE
. O
There O
never O
was O
a O
fellow O
for O
giving O
a O
good O
hearty O
kick O
to O
the O
people O
like O
Rigby S-PERSON
. O
Himself O
sprung O
from O
the O
dregs O
of O
the O
populace O
, O
this O
was O
disinterested O

What O
could O
be O
more O
patriotic O
and O
magnanimous O
than O
his O
Jeremiads S-PERSON
over O
the O
fall O
of O
the O
Montmorencis S-NORP
and O
the O
Crillons S-NORP
, O
or O
the O
possible O
catastrophe O
of O
the O
Percys S-PERSON
and O
the O
Manners O
! O
The O
truth O
of O
all O
this O
hullaballoo O
was O
that O
Rigby S-PERSON
had O
a O
sly O
pension O
which O
, O
by O
an O
inevitable O
association O
of O
ideas O
, O
he O
always O
connected O
with O
the O
maintenance O
of O
an O
Aristocracy O
. O
All O
his O
rigmarole O
dissertations O
on O
the B-EVENT
French I-EVENT
Revolution E-EVENT
were O
impelled O
by O
this O
secret O
influence O

and O
when O
he O
wailed O
over O
" O
la O

aux O
châteaux O
, O
" O
and O
moaned O
like O
a O

Mr. O

found O
a O
summons O
to O
Monmouth B-FAC
House E-FAC
waiting O
him O
, O
and O
an O
urgent O
note O
from O
Lucretia S-PERSON
begging O
that O
he O
would O
permit O
nothing O
to O
prevent O
him O
seeing O
her O
for O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes E-TIME
before O
he O
called O
on O
the O
Marquess S-PERSON
. O
Lucretia S-PERSON
, O
acting O
on O
the O
unconscious O
intimation O
of O
Flora S-GPE
, O
had O
in O
the O
course O
of O
four B-TIME
- I-TIME
and I-TIME
- I-TIME
twenty I-TIME
hours E-TIME
obtained O
pretty O
ample O
and O
accurate O
details O
of O
the O
cause O
of O
contention O
between O
Coningsby S-PERSON
and O
her O
husband O
. O
She O
could O
inform O
Mr. O
Rigby S-PERSON
not O
only O
that O
Lord O
Monmouth S-PERSON
was O
highly O
incensed O
against O
his O
grandson O
| | O
but O
that O
the O
cause O
of O
their O
misunderstanding O
arose O
about O
a O
seat O
in O
the B-ORG
House I-ORG
of I-ORG
Commons E-ORG
, O
and O
that O
seat O
too O
the O
one O
which O
Rigby S-PERSON
had O
long O
appropriated O
to O
himself O
, O
and O
over O
whose O
registration O
he O
had O
watched O
with O
such O
affectionate O
solicitude O
. O
Lady B-PERSON
Monmouth E-PERSON
arranged O
this O
information O
like O
a O
first S-ORDINAL
- O
rate O
artist O
| | O
and O
gave O
it O
a O
grouping O
and O
a O
colour O
, O
which O
produced O
the O
liveliest O
effect O
upon O
her O
confederate O
. O
The O
countenance O
of O
Rigby S-PERSON
was O
almost O
ghastly O
as O
he O
received O
the O
intelligence O

a O
grin O
, O
half S-CARDINAL
of O
malice O
, O
half S-CARDINAL
of O
terror O
, O
played O
over O
his O
features O
. O
" O
I O
told O
you O
to O
beware O
of O
him O
long O

" O
" O

Lady B-PERSON

at O

found O

labour O

it O
so O
happened O

applied O
for O
aid O
in O
this O
endeavour O
to O
the O
very O
individual O

power O
it O
rested O
to O
accomplish O
all O
her O
desire O
while O
in O
doing O
so O
he O
felt O
at O
the O

time O

was O
defending O
his O
own O
position O
and O
advancing O
his O
own O
interests O
. O
Lady B-PERSON
Monmouth E-PERSON
again O
threw O
aside O
the O
book O

more O
than O
once O
she O
had O
discarded O
. O
She O
paced O
the O
room O

restless O
rather O
than O
disquieted O
. O
She O
had O
complete O
confidence O
in O
Rigby's S-PERSON
ability O
for O
the O
occasion O

and O
with O
her O
knowledge O
of O
Lord O
Monmouth's S-PERSON
character O
, O
she O
could O
not O
contemplate O
the O
possibility O
of O
failure O
, O
if O
the O
circumstances O
were O
adroitly O
introduced O
to O

consideration O

Still O
time O
stole O
on O

the O
harassing O
and O
exhausting O
process O
of O
suspense O
was O
acting O
on O
her O
nervous O
system O
. O
She O
began O
to O
think O
that O
Rigby S-PERSON
had O
not O
found O
the O
occasion O
favourable O
for O
the O
catastrophe O

that O
Lord O
Monmouth S-PERSON
from O
apprehension O
of O
disturbing O
Rigby S-PERSON
and O
entailing O
explanations O
on O
himself O
had O
avoided O
the O
necessary O
communication O

that O
her O
skilful O
combination O
for O
the O
moment O
had O
missed O
. O
Two B-TIME
hours E-TIME
had O
now O
elapsed O
, O
and O
Lucretia S-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
state O
of O
considerable O
irritation O
was O
about O
to O
inquire O
whether O
Mr. O
Rigby S-PERSON
were O
with O
his O
Lordship O
, O
when O
the O
door O
of O
her O
boudoir O
opened O
, O
and O
that O
gentleman O
appeared O
. O
" O
How O
long O
you O
have O
been O
, O
" O
exclaimed O
Lady B-PERSON
Monmouth E-PERSON
. O
" O
Now O

down O
and O
tell O
me O
what O
has O
past O

" O
Lady B-PERSON
Monmouth E-PERSON
pointed O
to O
the O
seat O

Flora S-PERSON
had O
occupied O
. O
" O
I O
thank O
your O

, O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Rigby S-PERSON
with O
a O
somewhat O
grave O
and O
yet O
perplexed O
expression O
of O
countenance O
, O

seating O
himself O
at O
some O
little O
distance O
from O
his O
companion O
, O
" O

I O
am O
very O
well O
here O

There O
was O
a O
pause O

the O
invitation O
of O
Lady B-PERSON
Monmouth E-PERSON

communicate O
, O
with O
his O
usual O
readiness O

volubility O
, O
Mr. O
Rigby S-PERSON
was O
silent O
, O

if O
it O
were O
possible O
to O
use O
such O
an O
expression O
with O
regard O
to O
such O
a O

, O
apparently O
embarrassed O
. O
" O

greatly O
shocked O

replied O
Mr. O

with O
a O
pious O
expression O
of O
features O
. O
" O
Such O
monstrous O
ingratitude O

very O
justly O
observed O

say O

my O
dear O

" O
said O
Lady B-PERSON
Monmouth E-PERSON
. O
" O
Lord O
Monmouth S-PERSON
was O
pleased O
to O
say O
that O

" O
said O
Mr. O

, O
" O
will O
allow O
the O
connection O
that O
at O

subsists O
between O
that O
gentleman O

his O
noble O
relative O

Lord O

with O
great O
impatience O

demurely O

" O
" O
Lord O

was O
a O
churlish O

had O
for O
some O
time O
been O
fitting O
up O
for O
him O
under O
the O
superintendence O
of O
Mr. O
Rigby S-PERSON
, O
who O
, O
as O
Coningsby S-PERSON
also O
learnt O
, O
now O
permanently O
resided O
at O
Monmouth B-FAC
House E-FAC
. O
All O
this O
intelligence O
made O
Coningsby S-PERSON
ponder O
. O
He O
was O
sufficiently O
acquainted O
with O
the O
parties O
concerned O
to O
feel O
assured O
that O
he O
had O
not O
learnt O
the O
whole O
truth O
. O
What O
had O
really O
taken O
place O
, O
and O
what O
was O
the O
real O
cause O
of O
the O
occurrences O
, O
were O
equally O
mystical O
to O
him O
: O
all O
he O
was O
convinced O
of O
was O
, O
that O
some O
great O
domestic O
revolution O
had O
been O
suddenly O
effected O
. O
facility O
, O
is O
bewitching O
. O
Lord O
Monmouth S-PERSON
was O
never O
garrulous O
: O
he O
was O
always O
pithy O
and O
could O
be O
picturesque O
. O
He O
revealed O
a O
character O
in O
a O
sentence O
| | O
and O
detected O
the O
ruling O
passion O
with O
the O
hand O
of O
a O
master O
. O
Besides O
he O
had O
seen O
everybody O
and O
had O
done O
everything O
| | O
and O
though O
on O
the O
whole O
too O
indolent O
for O
conversation O
, O
and O
loving O
to O
be O
talked O
to O
, O
these O
were O
circumstances O
which O
made O
his O
too O
rare O
communications O
the O
more O
precious O
. O
the O
devil O
Care O
and O
all O
his O
works O
. O
And O
well O
it O
was O
, O
that O
he O
found O
such O
agreeable O
companions O
, O
for O
time O
flowed O
on O
, O
and O
no O
summons O
arrived O
to O
call O
him O
to O
his O
grandfather's O
presence O
, O
and O
no O
herald O
to O
announce O
his O
grandfather's O
advent O
. O
The O
ladies O
and O
Coningsby S-PERSON
had O
exhausted O
badinage O
| | O
they O
had O
examined O
and O
criticised O
all O
the O
furniture O
| | O
had O
rifled O
the O
vases O
of O
their O
prettiest O
flowers O

and O
Clotilde S-PERSON
who O
had O
already O
sung O
several O
times O
, O
was O
proposing O
a O
duet O
to O
Ermengarde S-PERSON
, O
when O
a O
servant O
entered O
, O
and O
told O
the O
ladies O
that O
a O
carriage O
was O
in O
attendance O
to O
give O
them O
an O
airing O
, O
and O
after O
that O
Lord O
Monmouth S-PERSON
hoped O
they O
would O
return O
and O
dine O
with O
him O
| | O
then O
turning O
to O
Coningsby S-PERSON
he O
informed O
him O
with O
his O
Lord's O
compliments O
, O
that O
Lord O
Monmouth S-PERSON
was O
sorry O
he O
was O
too O
much O
engaged O
to O
see O
him O
. O
Nothing O
was O
to O
be O
done O
but O
to O
put O
a O
tolerably O
good O
face O
upon O
it O
. O
" O
Embrace O
Lord O
Monmouth S-PERSON
for O
me O
, O
" O
said O
Coningsby S-PERSON
to O
his O
fair O
friends O
, O
" O
and O
tell O
him O
I O
think O
it O
very O
unkind O
that O
he O
did O
not O
ask O
me O
to O
dinner O
with O
you O
. O
" O
He O
did O
not O
wish O
to O
be O
reminded O
by O
anything O
or O
any O
person O
that O
he O
had O
still O
in O
some O
degree O
the O
misfortune O
of O
being O
a O
responsible O
member O
of O
society O
. O
He O
wanted O
to O
be O
surrounded O
by O
individuals O
who O
were O
above O
or O
below O
the O
conventional O
interests O
of O
what O
is O
called O
" O
the O
World O
. O
" O
He O
wanted O
to O
hear O
nothing O
of O
those O
painful O
and O
embarrassing O
influences O
which O
from O
our O
contracted O
experience O
and O
want O
of O
enlightenment O
, O
we O
magnify O
into O
such O
undue O
importance O
. O
For O
this O
purpose O
he O
wished O
to O
have O
about O
him O
persons O
whose O
knowledge O
of O
the O
cares O
of O
life O
concerned O
only O
the O
means O
of O
existence O

and O
whose O
sense O
of O
its O
objects O
referred O
only O
to O
the O
sources O
of O
enjoyment O

persons O
who O
had O
not O
been O
educated O
in O
the O
idolatry O
of O
Respectability O

that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
of O
realizing O
such O
an O
amount O
of O
what O
is O
termed O
Character O
by O
a O
hypocritical O
deference O
to O
the O
prejudices O
of O
the O
community O
, O
as O
may O
enable O
them O
at O
suitable O
times O
, O
and O
under O
convenient O
circumstances O
and O
disguises O
, O
to O
plunder O
the O
Public O

This O
was O
the B-ORG
Monmouth I-ORG
Philosophy E-ORG
. O
and O
ties O
of O
all O
kinds O
. O
He O
did O
not O
wish O
to O
be O
reminded O
of O
his O
identity O
| | O
but O
to O
swim O
unmolested O
and O
undisturbed O
in O
his O
Epicurean O
dream O
. O
When O
therefore O
his O
fair O
visitors O
, O
Clotilde S-PERSON
who O
opened O
her O
mouth O
only O
to O
breathe O
roses O
and O
diamonds O

and O
Ermengarde S-PERSON
who O
was O
so O
good O
- O
natured O
that O
she O
sacrificed O
even O
her O
lovers O
to O
her O
friends O

saw O
him O
merely O
to O
exclaim O
at O
the O

moment O

with O
the O

" O
Why O

not O
you O
ask O
him O

dinner O
! O
" O
And O
then O
without O
waiting O
for O
his O
reply O
entered O
with O
that O
rapidity O
of O
elocution O
which O
Frenchwomen S-NORP
can O
alone O
command O
into O
the O
catalogue O
of O
his O
charms O
and O
accomplishments O
, O
Lord O
Monmouth S-PERSON
began O
to O
regret O
that O
he O
really O
had O
not O
seen O
Coningsby S-PERSON
who O
it O
appears O
might O
have O
greatly O
contributed O
to O
the O
pleasure O
of O
the O
day O
. O
The O
message O
which O
was O
duly O
given O
however O
settled O
the O
business O
. O
Lord O
Monmouth S-PERSON
felt O
that O
any O
chance O
of O
explanations O
or O
even O
allusions O
to O
the O
past O
was O
out O
of O
the O
question O

and O
to O
defend O
himself O
from O
the O
accusations O
of O
his O
animated O
guests O
, O
he O
said O
, O
" O
Well O
, O
he O
shall O
come O
to O
dine O
with O
you O
next O
time O
. O
" O
There O
is O
no O
end O
to O
the O
influence O
of O
woman O
on O
our O
life O
. O
It O
is O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
everything O
that O
happens O
to O
us O
. O
And O
so O
it O
was O
, O
that O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
all O
the O
combinations O
of O
Lucretia S-PERSON
and O
Mr. O
Rigby S-PERSON
, O
and O
the O
mortification O
and O
resentment O
of O
Lord O
Monmouth S-PERSON
, O
the O
favourable O
impression O
he O
casually O
made O
on O
a O
couple O

memorable O
interview O
at O

to O
receive O
an O
invitation O
again O
to O
dine O
with O
his O
grandfather O

Rigby S-PERSON
. O
Our O
hero O
remarked O
that O
Villebecque S-PERSON
on O
this O
occasion O
sat O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
table O
, O
but O
Flora S-PERSON
did O
not O
appear O
. O
there O
were O
relations O
of O
intimacy O
scarcely O
less O
inseparable O
. O
Coningsby S-PERSON
had O
spoken O
to O
Lady B-PERSON
Everingham E-PERSON
of O
the O
rumoured O
marriage O
of O
her O
elder O
brother O
, O

found O
, O
although O
the O
family O
had O
not O
yet O
been O
formally O
apprised O
of O
it O
, O
she O
entertained O
very O
little O
doubt O
of O
its O
ultimate O
occurrence O

She O
admired O
Miss O
Millbank S-PERSON
with O
whom O
her O
acquaintance O
continued O
slight O

and O
she O
wished O

course O
that O
her O
brother O
should O
marry O
and O
be O
happy O
, O
" O
but O
Percy S-PERSON

often O
in O

" O
she O
would O
add O

never O
likes O
us O

intimate O
with O

He O
thinks O
it O
destroys O
the O
romance O

that O
domestic O
familiarity O
may O
compromise O
his O
heroic O

often O
a B-TIME

he O
figured O

the O

apparently O
followed O

courted O

all O

he O
had O
been O
plunged O
in O
the O
darkest O
fits O
of O
irremediable O
wetchedness O
. O
He O
had O
of O
course O
frequently O
met O
Lady B-PERSON

their O
salutations O

never O
omitted O

on O
each O
side O
cordial O

were O
brief O

There O
seemed O
to O

a O
tacit O
understanding O

bright O

yet O
, O
like O
many O
critical O
epochs O
, O
the O
person O
most O
interested O
in O
it O
was O
not O
sufficiently O
aware O
of O
its O
character O
. O
The O
first S-ORDINAL
feeling O
which O
he O
experienced O
at O
the O
intelligence O
was O
sincere O
affliction O
. O
He O
was O
fond O
of O
his O
grandfather O

had O
received O
great O
kindness O
from O
him O
, O
and O
at O
a O
period O
of O
life O
when O
it O
was O
most O
welcome O
. O
The O
neglect O
and O
hardships O
of O
his O
early O
years O
, O
instead O
of O
leaving O

prejudice O
against O
one O
who O
by O
some O
might O
be O
esteemed O
their O
author O

had O
only O
rendered O
by O
their O
contrast O
Coningsby S-PERSON
more O
keenly O
sensible O
of O
the O
solicitude O

enjoyment O

had O
been O
lavished O
on O
his O
happy O
youth O

excursion O
to O
the O

his O
various O
visits O
to O

continued O
at O

the O
whole O

with O
an O
indefinite O
feeling O
which O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
many O
a O
rational O
effort O
, O
did O
nevertheless O
haunt O
his O
mind O
, O
that O
this O
great O
and O
sudden O
event O
might O
exercise O
a O
very O
vast O

beneficial O
influence O
on O
his O
worldly O
position O

Coningsby S-PERSON
could O
not O
but O
feel O
some O
consolation O
in O
the O
affliction O
which O
he O
sincerely O
experienced O
, O
in O
the O
hope O
that O
he O
might O
at O

Coningsby S-PERSON

a O
grave O
rather O
than O

countenance O
to O

his O
shoulders O

" O

Sidonia O
good O

Coningsby S-PERSON
out O
of O

They O
walked O
together O
to O
Sidonia's B-FAC

Carlton B-FAC

what O
he O
had O
been O
doing O

since O
they O
last O
met O

himself O

with O
a O
little O
more O
feeling O
in O
his O
manner O
than O
was O
his O
custom O
. O
When O
they O
had O
arrived O
there O
, O
Sidonia S-PERSON
ordered O
their O
dinner O
instantly O
, O
and O
during O
the O
interval O
between O
the O
command O
and O
its O
appearance O
, O
he O
called O
Coningsby's S-PERSON

to O
an O
old O
German S-NORP
painting O

had O
just O
received O

its O
brilliant O
colouring O

quaint O
costumes O

" O
Eat O
, O
and O
an O
appetite O
will O
come O

Sidonia S-PERSON

when O

observed O

natural O
miseries O

misfortunes O
are O
mere O
illusions O

What O
seems O
conventionally O

view O
a O
great O
misfortune O
, O
if O
subsequently O
viewed O
in O
its O

This O

all O

when O
the O
welcome O
morning O
hymn O

his O
success O

fame O
would O
sound O

He O
slept O

deep O
sleep O

Coningsby S-PERSON

where O
he O
intended O

when O
his O
servant O
brought O
him O
a O
note O
. O
The O
handwriting O
was O
feminine O
. O
The O
note O
was O
from O
Flora S-PERSON
. O
The O
contents O
were O
brief O
. O
She O
begged O
Mr. O
Coningsby S-PERSON
with O
great O
earnestness O
to O
do O
her O
the O
honour O
and O
the O
kindness O
of O
calling O
on O
her O
at O
his O
earliest O
convenience O
, O
at O
the O
hotel O
in O
Brook B-FAC
Street E-FAC
where O
she O
now O
resided O
. O
It O
was O
an O
interview O
which O
Coningsby S-PERSON
would O
rather O
have O
avoided O

yet O
it O
seemed O
to O
him O
, O
after O
a O
moment's O
reflection O
, O
neither O
just O
nor O
kind O
, O
nor O
manly O
to O
refuse O
her O
request O
. O
Flora S-PERSON
had O
not O
injured O
him O
. O
She O
was O
after O
all O
his O
kin O
. O
Was O
it O
for O
a O
moment O
to O
be O
supposed O
that O
he O
was O
envious O
of O
her O
lot O
? O
He O
replied O
, O
therefore O
, O
that O
in O
an B-TIME
hour E-TIME
he O
would O
wait O
upon O
her O
. O
In O
an B-TIME
hour E-TIME
then O
two S-CARDINAL
individuals O
are O
to O
be O
brought O
together O
, O
whose O
first S-ORDINAL
meeting O
was O
held O
under O
circumstances O
most O
strangely O
different O
. O
Then O
Coningsby S-PERSON
was O
the O
patron O
, O
a O
generous O
and O
spontaneous O
one O
, O
of O
a O
being O
obscure O
, O
almost O
friendless O
, O
and O
sinking O
under O
bitter O
mortification O
. O
His O
favour O
could O
not O
be O
the O
less O
appreciated O
because O
he O
was O
the O
chosen O
relative O
of O
a O
powerful O
noble O
. O
That O
noble O
was O
no O
more O

his O
vast O
inheritance O
had O
devolved O
on O
the O
disregarded O
, O
even O
despised O
actress O
, O
whose O
suffering O
emotions O
Coningsby S-PERSON
had O
then O
soothed O
, O
and O
whose O
fortune O
had O
risen O
on O
the O
destruction O
of O
all O
his O
prospects O
, O
and O
the O
baulk O
of O
all O
his O
aspirations O
. O
Flora S-PERSON
was O
alone O
when O
Coningsby S-PERSON
was O
ushered O
into O
the O
room O
. O
The O
extreme O
delicacy O
of O
her O
appearance O
was O
increased O
by O
her O
deep O
mourning O
, O
and O
seated O
in O
a O
cushioned O
chair O
, O
from O
which O
she O
seemed O
to O
rise O
with O
an O
effort O
, O
she O
certainly O
presented O
little O
of O
the O
character O
of O
a O
fortunate O
and O
prosperous O
heiress O
. O
" O
You O
are O
very O
good O

come O
to O
me O

" O
she O
said O
, O
faintly O
smiling O

in O
which O
she O
placed O
her O
own O

looking O
down O
much O
embarrassed O

" O
You O

an O
agreeable O
situation O
here O

" O
said O
Coningsby S-PERSON
, O
trying O
to O
break O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
awkwardness O
of O
their O
meeting O

" O
Yes O

" O
There O
was O
a O
slight O
pause O

and O
then O
Flora S-PERSON
sighed O

said O
: O

again O
with O
a O
downcast O
glance O

Then O
looking O
up O
embarrassed O

blushing O
deeply O

added O

CHAPTER O
V O

About O
a O
week O
after O
this O
interview O
with O
Flora S-PERSON
, O
as O
Coningsby S-PERSON
one B-TIME
morning E-TIME
was O
about O
to O
sally O
forth O
from O
the O
Albany S-GPE
to O
visit O
some O
chambers O
in O
the O
Temple S-FAC
to O
which O
his O
notice O
had O
been O
attracted O
, O
there O
was O
a O
loud O
ring O
, O
a O
bustle O
in O
the O
hall O
, O
and O
Henry B-PERSON
Sydney E-PERSON
and O
Buckhurst S-PERSON
were O
ushered O
in O
. O
younger O
son O
, O
could O
offer O
little O
but O
sympathy O
, O
but O
he O
declared O
that O
it O
was O
his O
intention O
also O
to O
study O
for O
the O
Bar O
, O
so O
they O
should O
not O
be O
divided O
. O
Buckhurst S-PERSON
after O
many O
embraces O
, O
and O
some O
ordinary O
talk O
, O
took O
Coningsby S-PERSON
aside O
, O
and O
said O
, O
" O
My O
dear O
fellow O
, O
I O
have O
no O
objection O
to O
Henry B-PERSON
Sydney E-PERSON
hearing O
everything O
I O
say O
| | O
but O
still O
these O
are O
subjects O
which O
men O
like O
to O
be O
discussed O
in O
private O
. O
Of O
course O
I O
expect O
you O
to O
share O
my O
fortune O
. O
There O
is O
enough O
for O
both O
. O
We O
will O
have O
an O
exact O
division O
. O
" O
There O
was O
something O
in O
Buckhurst's S-GPE
servent O
resolution O
very O
loveable O
and O
a O
little O
humorous O
, O
just O
enough O
to O
put O
one O
in O
a O
good O
temper O
with O
human O
nature O
and O
life O
. O
If O
there O
were O
any O
fellow's O
fortune O
in O
the O
world O
that O
Coningsby S-PERSON
would O
share O
, O
Buckhurst's S-PERSON
would O
have O
had O
the O
preference O
, O
but O
while O
he O
pressed O
his O
hand O
, O
and O
with O
a O
glance O
in O
which O
a O
tear O
and O
a O
smile O
seemed O
to O
contend O
for O
mastery O
, O
he O
gently O
indicated O
why O
such O
arrangements O
were O
with O
our O
present O
manners O
impossible O
. O
fortune O
is O
a O
bore O
. O
What O
I O
vote O
that O
we O
three S-CARDINAL
do O
at O
once O
is O
to O
take O
plenty O
of O
ready O
money O
, O
and O
enter O
the O
Austrian S-NORP
service O
. O
By O
Jove S-PERSON
, O
it O
is O
the O
only O
thing O
to O
do O
. O
" O
" O
There O
is O
something O
in O
that O
, O
" O
said O
Coningsby S-PERSON
. O
" O
In O
the O
meantime O
, O
suppose O
you O
two S-CARDINAL
fellows O
walk O
with O
me O
to O
the O
Temple S-FAC

I O
have O
an O
appointment O
to O
look O
at O
some O
chambers O

the O
heart O
of O
a O
great O
city O
in O
the B-DATE
nineteenth I-DATE

so O
much O
of O
the O
grave O
romance O
and O
picturesque O
decorum O
of O
our O
past O
manners O
. O
Henry B-PERSON
Sydney E-PERSON
was O
very O
sanguine O
| | O
he O
was O
reconciled O
to O
the O
disinheritance O
of O
Coningsby S-PERSON
by O
the O
conviction O
that O
it O
was O
a O
providential O
dispensation O
to O
make O
him O
a O
Lord O
Chancellor O
. O
These O
faithful O
friends O
remained O
in O
town O
with O
Coningsby S-PERSON
until O
he O
was O
established O
in O
Paper B-FAC
Buildings E-FAC
, O
and O
had O
become O
a O
pupil O
of O
a O
celebrated O
special O
pleader O
. O
They O
would O
have O
remained O
longer O
, O
had O
not O
he O
himself O
suggested O
that O
it O
was O
better O
that O
they O
should O
part O
. O
They O
parted O
with O
deep O
emotion O
. O
It O
seemed O
a O
terrible O
catastrophe O
after O
all O
the O
visions O
of O
their O
boyish O
days O
| | O
their O
college O
dreams O

and O
their O
dazzling O
adventures O
in O
the O
world O

" O
And O
this O
is O
the O
end O
of O
Coningsby S-PERSON
, O
the O
brilliant O
Coningsby S-PERSON
, O
that O
we O
all O
loved O
, O
that O
was O
to O
be O
our O
leader O
! O
" O
said O
Buckhurst S-PERSON
to O
Lord O
Henry S-PERSON
as O
they O
quitted O
him O
. O
" O
Well O
, O
come O
what O
may O

has O
lost O
something O
of O
its O
bloom O

" O
be O
frequently O
together O

It O
is O
dreadful O
to O
think O
that O
in O
the O
ways O
of O
life O
our O
hearts O
may O
become O
estranged O

I O
never O
felt O
more O
wretched O
than O
I O
do O
at O
this O
moment O

yet O
I O
have O
faith O

not O
lose O
him O

" O
" O
Amen O

said O
Buckhurst S-PERSON
, O
" O

quite O
convinced O
that O

Henry B-PERSON

gravely O

was O
nothing O
to O
haunt O

shrined O
in O
the O
innermost O
sanctuary O

his O
heart O

consciousness O

But O
it O
was O
a O
tradition O
, O
no O
longer O

hope O

The O
moment O
that O
he O
had O
fairly O
recovered O
from O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
shock O
of O
his O
grandfather's O
will O
, O
had O
clearly O
ascertained O
the O
consequences O

himself O

had O
resolved O
on O
the O
course O

communicated O
unreservedly O

renounced O

it O
ill O

no O

Coningsby S-PERSON

himself O

intimate O
to O
Oswald S-PERSON

He O

would O
be O
ever O
cherished O
( O

wished O
in O
parting O
from O
them O
to O
take O
a O
step O
which O
should O
conciliate O
all O

these O
reasons O
he O
begged O

a O
gentleman O
who O
bore O
a O
name O

many O
of O
them O
greatly O
honoured O
, O
for O
himself O
he O
knew O
the O
individual O
, O
and O
it O
was O
his O
firm O
opinion O
that O
whether O
they O
considered O
his O
talents O
, O
his O
character O
, O
or O
the O
ancient O
connection O
of O
his O
family O
with O
the O

could O
not O
propose O
a O

more O
worthy O

confidence O

Harry B-PERSON
Coningsby E-PERSON
, O

that O

The O
whole O
of O
Lord O
Monmouth's S-PERSON
reduced O
legacy O

devoted O
to O
this O
end O

The O
third S-ORDINAL
edition O

left O
Mr. O

in O
vain O
attempting O

time O
for O
Coningsby S-PERSON

be O

for O
no O
one O
entertained O
a O
doubt O
of O

Coningsby S-PERSON
did O
not O
sleep O
a O
wink O
that O
night O
, O
and O
yet O
when O
he O
rose O
early O
felt O
fresh O
enough O
for O
any O
exploit O
however O
difficult O
or O
hazardous O
. O
He O
felt O
as O
an O
Egyptian S-NORP
does O
when O
the O
Nile S-LOC
rises O
after O
its O
elevation O
had O
been O
despaired O
of O
. O
At O
the O
very O
lowest O
ebb O
of O
his O
fortunes O
, O
an O
event O
had O
occurred O
which O
seemed O
to O
restore O
all O

He O
dared O
not O
contemplate O
the O
ultimate O
result O

all O

Enough O
for O
him O
that O
when O
all O
seemed O
dark O
, O
he O
was O
about O
to O
be O
returned O

the O
father O

vanquished O
rival O

all O

triumphant O
sense O

complete O

absolute O
success O

were O

materials O
from O

was O
at O
length O
evolved O

all O

subsided O
in O

gratitude O
to O
that O

His O
eye O
sparkled O

energetic O

" O

absolutely O
impressed O
with O
Coningsby's S-PERSON

determined O

acknowledged O

Sir O

to O
Mr. O

stared O
, O
but O
Sir O
Joseph S-PERSON
spoke O
feebly O
. O
Lady O
Wallinger S-PERSON
conveyed O
all O
this O
intelligence O

all O
her O
impressions O
to O
Oswald S-PERSON

The O
younger O
Millbank S-PERSON
talked O
with O
his O
father O
, O
who O
making O
no O
admissions O
listened O
with O
interest O
, O
inveighed O
against O
Lord O
Monmouth S-PERSON
, O
and O
condemned O
his O
will O

the O
silent O
sadness O
of O
Edith S-PERSON
, O
his O
own O
conviction O

assured O
him O
that O
he O
could O
do O
nothing O
wiser O
or O
better O
than O
take O
this O
young O
man O
to O
his O
heart O

so O
ordained O
it O
that O
Mr. O

who O
was O
after O
all O
the O
creature O
of O
impulse O

suddenly O

all O
that O

This O
is O
a O
very O
imperfect O

crude O
intimation O
of O
what O
had O
occurred O
at O
Millbank S-GPE

Hellingsley S-GPE

yet O
it O
conveys O
a O
faint O
sketch O
of O
the O
enchanting O
intelligence O
that O
Oswald S-PERSON
conveyed O
to O
Coningsby S-PERSON
during O
their O
rapid O
travel O

that O
Mr. O

resigned O

He O
was O
however O
requested O

not O

Coningsby S-PERSON

borne O
through O
enthusiastic O
Darlford S-PERSON
like O
Paulus B-PERSON

returning O
from O

Bluck E-PERSON
walked O
together O
like O
lambs O
at O
the O
head O
of O
his O
procession O
. O
The O
broad O
street O
was O
so O
crowded O
, O
that O
as O
every O
one O
declared O
you O
might O
have O
walked O
on O
the O
heads O
of O
the O
people O
. O
Every O
window O
was O
full O

the O
very O
roofs O
were O
peopled O
. O
The O
car O
stopped O
, O
and O
the O
populace O
gave O
three S-CARDINAL
cheers O
for O
Mr. O
Millbank S-PERSON
. O
Their O
late O
member O
surrounded O
by O
his O
friends O
stood O
in O
the O
balcony O
which O
was O
fitted O
up O
with O
Coningsby's S-PERSON
colours O
and O
bore O
his O
name O
on O
the O
hangings O
in O
gigantic O
letters O
formed O
of O
dahlias O
. O
The O
flashing O
and O
inquiring O
eye O
of O
Coningsby S-PERSON
caught O
the O
form O
of O
Edith S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
leaning O
on O
her O
father's O
arm O
. O
The O
hustings O
were O
opposite O
the O
hotel O
, O
and O
here O
after O
a O
while O
Coningsby S-PERSON
was O
carried O
, O
and O
stepping O
from O
his O
car O
, O
took O
up O
his O
post O
to O
address O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
a O
public O
assembly O
. O
Anxious O
as O
the O
people O
were O
to O
hear O
him O
, O
it O
was O
long O
before O
their O
enthusiasm O
could O
subside O
into O
silence O
. O
At O
length O
that O
silence O
was O
deep O
and O
absolute O
. O
He O
spoke O
| | O
his O
powerful O
and O
rich O
tones O
reached O
every O
ear O
. O
In O
five B-TIME
minutes' I-TIME
time E-TIME
every O
one O
looked O
at O
his O
neighbour O
, O
and O
without O
speaking O
they O
agreed O
that O
there O
never O
was O
anything O
like O
this O
heard O
in O
Darlford S-GPE
before O
. O
to O
express O
his O
gratitude O
for O
the O
unprecedented O
manner O
in O
which O
he O
had O
become O
their O
representative O
and O
for O
the O
spirit O
in O
which O
they O
had O
greeted O
him O
| | O
but O
he O
had O
to O
offer O
them O
no O
niggard O
exposition O
of O
the O
views O
and O
opinions O
of O
the O
member O
whom O
they O
had O
so O
confidingly O
chosen O
without O
even O
a O
formal O
declaration O
of O
his O
sentiments O
. O
He O
did O
this O
with O
so O
much O
clearness O
, O
and O
in O
a O
manner O
so O
pointed O
and O
popular O
, O
that O
the O
deep O
attention O
of O
the O
multitude O
never O
wavered O
. O
His O
lively O
illustrations O
kept O
them O
often O
in O
continued O
merriment O
. O
But O
when O
towards O
his O
close O
he O
drew O
some O
picture O
of O
what O
he O
hoped O
might O
be O
the O
character O
of O
his O
future O
and O
lasting O
connexion O
with O
the O
town O
, O
the O
vast O
throng O
was O
singularly O
affected O
. O
There O
were O
a O
great O
many O
present O
at O
that O
moment O
who O
though O
they O
had O
never O
seen O
Coningsby S-PERSON
before O
, O
would O
willingly O
have O
then O
died O
for O
him O
. O
Coningsby S-PERSON
had O
touched O
their O
hearts O
, O
for O
he O
had O
spoken O
from O
his O
own O
. O
His O
spirit O
had O
entirely O
magnetized O
them O
. O
Darlford S-PERSON
believed O
in O
Coningsby S-PERSON
: O
and O
a O
very O
good O
creed O
. O
The O
progress O
was O
slow O
, O
as O
every O
one O
wished O
to O
shake O
hands O
with O
him O
. O
His O
friends O
, O
however O
, O
at O
last O
safely O
landed O
him O
. O
He O
sprang O
up O
the O
stairs O
: O
he O
was O
met O
by O
Mr. O
Millbank S-PERSON
, O
who O
welcomed O
him O
with O
the O
greatest O
warmth O
, O
and O
offered O
his O
hearty O
congratulations O
. O
" O
It O
is O
to O
you O
, O
dear O
sir O
, O
that O
I O
am O
indebted O
for O
all O
this O
, O
" O
said O
Coningsby S-PERSON
. O
" O
No O
, O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Millbank S-PERSON
, O
" O
it O
is O
to O
your O
own O
high O
principles O
, O
great O
talents O
, O
and O
good O
heart O
. O
" O
After O
he O
had O
been O
presented O
by O
the O
late O
Member O
to O
the O
principal O
personages O
in O
the O
borough O
, O
Mr. O
Millbank S-PERSON
said O
: O
" O
I O
think O
we O
must O
now O
give O
Mr. O
Coningsby S-PERSON
a O
little O
rest O
. O
" O
Come O
with O
me O
, O
" O
he O
added O
| | O
" O
here O
is O
some O
one O
who O
will O
be O
very O
glad O
to O
see O
you O
. O
" O
Speaking O
thus O
, O
he O
led O
our O
hero O
a O
little O
away O
, O
and O
placing O
his O
arm O
in O
Coningsby's S-GPE
, O
with O
great O
affection O
opened O
the O
door O
of O
an O
apartment O
. O
There O
was O
Edith S-PERSON
radiant O
with O
loveliness O
and O
beaming O
with O
love O
. O
Their O
agitated O
hearts O
told O
at O
a O
glance O
the O
tumult O
of O
their O
joy O
. O
The O
father O
joined O
their O
hands O
, O
and O
blessed O
them O
with O
words O
of O
tenderness O
. O

. O
The O

after O
the O
death O
of O
Mr. O
Millbank S-PERSON
who O
in O
the O

, O
of O
his O

they O
raised O
a O

his O
youth O
. O
a O
