It O
is O
not O

these O

inscribed O

Nor O
merely O

     | O
because O
I O
was O
desirous O
to O
avail O
myself O
of O
the O
most O
graceful O
privilege O
of O
an O
author O

and O

     | O
dedicate O
my O
work O
to O
the O
friend O

whose O
talents O
I O
have O
always O
appreciated O

whose O
virtues O
I O

     | O
have O
ever O
admired O

But O
because O
in O
these O

I O
have O
endeavoured O
to O
picture O
something O

development O
of O

In O
these O

you O
will O
find O
many O
a O

partially O

Doubtless O
you O

     | O
may O
encounter O
some O
opinions O
with O
which O
you O
may O
not O

and O
some O
conclusions O
the O
accuracy O
of O

     | O
which O
you O
may O
find O
cause O

if O

generally O
succeeded O
in O

to O

The O

himself O
in O
a O

offered O

For O
some O
time O
, O
he O
remained O
with O

       | O
patient O
endurance O
planted O
against O
the O
wall O
, O
with O
his O
feet O
resting O
on O
the O
rail O
of O
his O
chair O
  O
|
       | O
but O
at O
length O
in O
his O
shifting O
posture O
he O
gave O
evidence O
of O
his O
restlessness O
, O
rose O
from O
his O
|
       | O
seat O
, O
looked O
out O
of O
the O
window O
into O

        | O
/ O

a O
small O

, O
changed O
it O
for O
the B-ORG

, O
then O
wrote O
his O
name O
over O
several O
sheets O
of O

       | O
foolscap O
paper O
, O
drew O
various O
landscapes O

  O
and O
then O
, O
splitting O
up O
a O
|
       | O
pen O
or O
two B-CARDINAL
, O
delivered O
himself O
of O
a O
yawn O
, O
which O
seemed O
the O
climax O
of O
his O
weariness O
. O
| 
  | O
And O
yet O
the O
youth O
's O
appearance O
did O
not O
betoken O
a O
character O
that O
, O
if O
the O
opportunity O
had O
|
       | O
offered O
, O
could O
not O
have O
found O
amusement O
and O
even O
instruction O
. O
His O
countenance O
, O
radiant O
with O
|
       | O
health O
and O
lustre O
of O
innocence O
, O
was O
at O
the O
same O
time O
thoughtful O
and O
resolute O
. O
The O
expression O
|
       | O
of O
his O
deep O
blue O
eye O
was O
serious O
. O
Without O
extreme O
regularity O
of O
features O
, O
the O
face O
was O
one O
|
       | O
that O
would O
never O
have O
passed O
unobserved O
. O
His O
short O
upper O
lip O
indicated O
a O
good O
breed O
  O
and O
his O
|
       | O
chestnut O
curls O
clustered O
over O
his O
open O
brow O
, O
while O
his O
shirt O
collar O
thrown O
over O
his O
shoulders O
|
       | O
was O
unrestrained O
by O
handkerchief O
or O
ribbon O
. O
Add O
to O
this O
, O
a O
limber O
and O
graceful O
figure O
, O
which O
|
       | O
the O
jacket O
|
        | O
/ O
| | O
of O
his O
boyish O
dress O
exhibited O
to O
great O
advantage O
. O
| 
  | O
Just O
as O
the O
youth O
, O
mounted O
on O
a O
chair O
, O
was O
adjusting O
the O
portrait O
of O
the O
Duke O
which O
he O
had O
|
       | O
observed O
to O
be O
awry O
, O
the O
gentleman O
for O
whom O
he O
had O
been O
all O
this O
time O
waiting O
entered O
the O
|
       | O
room O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Floreat O
Etona B-PERSON
! O
" O
hastily O
exclaimed O
the O
gentleman O
in O
a O
sharp O
voice O
, O
" O
you O
are O
setting O
the O
|
       | O
Duke O
to O
rights O
. O
I O
have O
left O
you O
a O
long O
time O
a O
prisoner O
  O
but O
I O
found O
them O
so O
busy O
here O
, O
that O
I O
|
       | O
myself O
made O
my O
escape O
with O
difficulty O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
He O
who O
uttered O
these O
words O
was O
a O
man O
of O
middle O
size O
and O
age O
, O
originally O
in O
all O
probability O
|
       | O
of O
a O
spare O
habit O
, O
but O
now O
a O
little O
inclined O
to O
corpulency O
. O
Baldness O
perhaps O
contributed O
to O
|
       | O
the O
spiritual O
expression O
of O
a O
brow O
, O
which O
was O
however O
essentially O
intellectual O
, O
and O
gave O
some O
|
       | O
character O
of O
openness O
to O
a O
countenance O
which O
, O
though O
not O
ill O
- O
favoured O
, O
was O
unhappily O
stamped O
|
       | O
by O
a O
sinister O
character O
that O
was O
not O
to O
be O
mistaken O
. O
His O
manner O
was O
easy O
, O
but O
rather O
|
       | O
audacious O
|
        | O
/ O
| | O
than O
well O
- O
bred O
. O
Indeed O
, O
while O
a O
visage O
which O
might O
otherwise O
be O
described O
as O
handsome O
|
       | O
was O
spoilt O
by O
a O
dishonest O
glance O
, O
so O
a O
demeanour O
that O
was O
by O
no O
means O
deficient O
in O
|
       | O
self O
- O
possession O
and O
facility O
, O
was O
tainted O
by O
an O
innate O
vulgarity O
, O
which O
in O
the O
long O
run O
, O
|
       | O
though O
seldom O
, O
yet O
surely O
, O
developed O
itself O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
youth O
had O
jumped O
off O
his O
chair O
on O
the O
entrance O
of O
the O
gentleman O
, O
and O
then O
taking O
up O
his O
|
       | O
hat O
, O
said O
: O
| 
  | O
" O
Shall O

" O
By O
all O

my O
dear O
boy O

" O
said O
the O
gentleman O
, O
putting O
his O
arm O
within O
that O
of O
the O
youth O
  O
|
       | O
and O
they O
were O
just O
on O
the O
point O
of O
leaving O
the O

when O
the O
door O
was O
suddenly O

thrown O

two B-CARDINAL

very O

declared O

The O

half I-DATE
had O
shaken O

received O
if O
possible O
an O
increase O

its O
intensity O

when O

known O

the O
early O

preventing O
that O
large O

their O
numbers O
with O
which O
they O
had O
been O
long O
menaced O
  O
rather O
indeed O
by O
mysterious O
rumours O

       | O
than O
by O
any O
official O
declaration O
  O

nevertheless O
in O
a O
manner O

carried O
conviction O

to O
no O

it O
was O
a O
rule O

with O
Mr. O

never O
to O
make O

off O

ordered O
the O

together O

He O

not O

how O
Henry B-PERSON

       | O
was O
embraced O
by O
his O

between O
his O
cousin O

how O
affectionately O
the O

rather O
looked O

gentleman O
pressing O

broken O
by O
the O

stopping O
before O
the O

       | O
At O
its O

Coningsby B-PERSON

invited O
in O
every B-DATE

said O
the O

Coningsby O
sprang O
forward O
with O
that O
desperation O
which O
the O
scaffold O
requires O
. O
His O
face O
was O

       | O
pale O
  O
his O
hand O
was O
moist O

his O
heart O
beat O

He O
had O
occasionally O

summoned O

Dr. O

  O
but O
there O
are O
some O
situations O
in O
life O
, O

       | O
such O
for O
instance O
as O
entering O
the O
room O

was O
to O

formally O

the O
bosom O

the O
noble O
house O
from O
which O
he O
had O
been O
so O
long O
estranged O

and O
at O
length O
to O
assume O
that O
social O

       | O
position O
to O
which O
his O
lineage O
entitled O
him O

       | O
the O
happy O

stir O
up O
the O
deep O
fountains O

in O
height O

midde O
size O

       | O
but O
somewhat O
portly O

corpulent O

His O
countenance O
was O
strongly O
marked O
  O
sagacity O
on O
the O
brow O

|
       | O
sensuality O
in O
the O

brown O

deep O
blue O
eye O
, O
madid O
and O
yet O
piercing O
, O
|
       | O
showed O
that O
the O
secretions O
of O
his O
brain O
were O
apportioned O
, O
half B-CARDINAL

voluptuousness O

half B-CARDINAL
to O

       | O
common O
sense O

But O
his O
general O
mien B-PERSON
was O
truly O
grand O
  O
full O
of O
a O
natural O
nobility O
, O
of O
which O
no O

one O
was O
more O

his O
costume O
was O

exact O

and O
even O
careful O

Rising O
as O
we O
have O
mentioned O
when O
his O
grandson O

with O
his O
left O

felt O

In O
the O
chaotic O

tumult O

his O
mind O

when O

was O
somewhat O
composed O
, O
" O

       | O
we O
will O
see O

" O

  | O
So O
they O

with O

  | O
" O
This O
grandfather O

thought O
Coningsby B-PERSON
, O
as O
musing O
he O
stood O
before O

       | O
a O
portrait O
in O

he O
recognised O
the O
features O
of O
the O
being O
from O
whom O
he O
had O
so O
recently O
and O
|
       | O
so O
strangely O
parted O

There O
he O
stood O

on O
a O

near O
him O
, O
a O
despatch O
lying O
at O

that O
indicated O
the O

       | O
special O
mission O
of O
high O
ceremony O
of O
which O
he O
had O
been O
the O
illustrious O

he O
opened O
the O

  | O
" O
Ah O

the O

" O
and O
then O
she O

       | O
threw O
a O
scrutinizing O
glance O
from O
a O
dark O
flashing O
eye O
at O
his O
companion O
. O

  | O
" O

The O
young O
lady O
, O
who O
was O
really O
more O
youthful O
than O
Coningsby B-PERSON
, O
but O
of O
a O
form O
and O
stature O
so O
|
       | O
developed O
, O
that O
she O
appeared O
almost O
a O
woman O
, O
bowed O
to O
the O
guest O
with O
some O
ceremony O
, O
and O
a O

       | O
faint O

then O
proceeded O
with O
her O

" O
You O

herself O
filling O

   | O
It O
was O
evident O
that O
he O

made O
a O
favourable O
impression O
on O
her O

, O
for O
|
       | O
ever O
and O
anon O
she O
put O
a O
truffle O
or O
some O
small O
delicacy O
in O
his O
plate O
, O
and O
insisted O
upon O
his O

it O

When O

It O
was O
urged O

   | O
confounding O

is O
singular O
that O

       | O
in O
an O

It O

we O

the O
thing O
quiet O

let O
the O
fellows O
disperse O

talk O

afterwards O

In O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
moments I-TIME
, O
the B-FAC
Long I-FAC
Walk I-FAC
had O
reassumed O
its O
usual O
character O

Sedgwick B-PERSON
, O
Herbert B-PERSON
, O

       | O
and O
one B-CARDINAL
or O
two B-CARDINAL

turned O
into O

, O
undisturbed O

unnoticed O
by O
the O

       | O
multitude O

they O
listened O
to O
the O
promised O
communication O
of O
Buckhurst B-ORG

Henry B-PERSON
Sydney I-PERSON
. O

   | O
and O
Vere B-PERSON
had O
gone O
about B-TIME
ten I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
, O
Coningsby B-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
very O
fresh O
, O
said O
he O
had O
|
       | O
changed O
his O
mind O
and O
should O
go O
and O
bathe O
, O
too O
. O
So O
he O
left O
us O
. O
He O
had O
scarcely O
got O
to O
the O
pool O
|
       | O
when O
he O
heard O
a O
cry O
. O
There O
was O
a O
fellow O
drowning O
. O
He O
threw O
off O
his O
clothes O
and O
was O
in O
in O
a O
|
       | O
moment O
. O
The O
fact O
is O
this O
, O
Millbank B-ORG
had O
plunged O
in O
the O
pool O
and O
found O
himself O
in O
some O
eddies O
, O
|
       | O
caused O
by O
the O
meeting O
of O
two B-CARDINAL
currents O
. O
He O
called O
out O
to O
Vere B-PERSON
not O
to O
come O
and O
tried O
to O
swim O
|
       | O
off O
. O
But O
he O
was O
beat O
, O
and O
seeing O
he O
was O
in O
danger O
, O
Vere B-PERSON
jumped O
in O
. O
But O
the O
stream O
was O
so O
|
       | O
strong O
from O
the O
great O
fall O
of O
water O
from O
the O
lasher O
above O
, O
that O
Vere B-PERSON
was O
exhausted O
before O
he O
|
       | O
could O
reach O
Millbank B-ORG
and O
nearly O
sank O
himself O
. O
Well O
, O
he O
just O
saved O
himself O
  O
but O
Millbank B-ORG
sank O
|
       | O
as O
Coningsby B-PERSON
jumped O
in O
. O
What O
do O
you O
think O
of O
that O
? O
" O

" O

Jove B-PERSON

favourite O
oath O

   | O
caught O
Millbank B-ORG
when O
he O
rose O
  O
but O
he O
found O
himself O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
the O
same O
|
       | O
strong O
current O
that O
had O
before O
nearly O
swamped O
Vere B-PERSON
. O
What O
a O
lucky O
thing O
that O
he O
had O
taken O
it O

       | O
into O
his O
head O
not O
to O
pull O
to O
- O
day O
! O
Fresher O
than O
Vere O
, O
he O
just O
managed O
to O
land O
Millbank B-ORG
and O
|
       | O
himself O
. O
The O
shouts O
of O
Vere B-PERSON
called O
us O
, O
and O
we O
arrived O
to O
find O
the O
bodies O
of O
Millbank B-ORG
and O
|
       | O
Coningsby O
apparently O
lifeless O
, O
for O
Millbank B-ORG
was O
quite O
gone O
, O
and O
Coningsby B-PERSON
had O
swooned O
on O

landing O

" O
Can O
you O
conceive O
a O
position O
more O

However O
there O
was O

we O
got O

soon O
all O
right O

Millbank B-ORG
, O
I O
can O
tell O
you O

gave O
us O
some O
trouble O

all O
up O

Henry B-PERSON
Sydney I-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Well O
, O
we O
were O
fairly O
frightened O
here O

with O
the O

idea O
engrossed O
his O
affection O

his O
hearth O

all O

exciting O
emotions O

a O
young O

fervent O
mind O

source O
of O
sensibility O
on O
which O
we O
have O
already O

       | O
touched O
. O
Lord O
Vere B-PERSON
, O
who O
lodged O
in O
the O
same O
house O
as O
Millbank B-ORG
, O
and O
was O
sitting O
by O
his O
bedside O
, O
|
       | O
observed O
as O
night O
fell O
that O
his O
mind O
wandered O
. O
| 
   | O
infringed O
the O
regulations O
, O
combined O
with O
the O
high O
character O
of O
Millbank B-ORG

made O

       | O
the O
authorities O
not O
over O

anxious O

with O
penalties O

breach O

which O
, O
in O

       | O
the O
case O

the O
only O

offender O
, O
had O
been O
attended O
with O
such O
impressive O
consequences O
. O
|
       | O
The O
feat O
of O
Coningsby B-PERSON
was O
extolled O
by O
all O
as O
an O
act O
of O
high O
gallantry O
and O
skill O
. O
It O
confirmed O
|
       | O
and O
increased O
the O
great O
reputation O
which O
he O
already O
enjoyed O
. O

  | O
" O
Millbank B-ORG

getting O
quite O

Coningsby B-PERSON

So O
they O
went O
without O

found O

up O

reading O

he O
had O
withdrawn O

over O
anxious O

The O
Liverpool B-GPE

       | O
Cabinet O
unconsciously O
approximated O

were O
convinced O

they O

bore O
an O
unintentional O

       | O
impartial O
testimony O

       | O

   | O
may O
be O

these O

their O

       | O
director O

when O
principle O

, O
by O
the O
courageous O
promulgation O

great O

have O
gradually O
formed O
a O

       | O
public O
opinion O

that O

They O

Ireland O

a O

from O

our O

Lastly O
, O
they O
might O

adjusted O
the O

  | O
A O
breakfast O
at O
Beaumanoir B-PERSON
was O
a O
meal O
of O
some O
ceremony O
. O
Every O

expected O

at O
a B-TIME
somewhat I-TIME
early I-TIME
hour I-TIME

Their O
host O
and O
hostess O
set O

example O
of O
|
       | O
punctuality O
. O
' O
Tis O
an O
old O
form O
rigidly O
adhered O
to O
in O
some O
great O
houses O
, O
but O
it O
must O
be O
|
       | O
confessed O
does O
not O
contrast O
very O
agreeably O
with O
the O
easier O
arrangements O
of O
establishments O
of O
|
       | O
less O
pretension O
and O
of O
more O
modern O
order O
. O
| 
   | O
without O
notice O
  O
and O
several O
inquired O
with O
some O
anxiety O
, O
whether O
their O
host O
were O
|
       | O
indisposed O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
The O
Duke O
has O
received O
some O
letters O
from O
London B-GPE

detain O
him O

" O
replied O
the O
Duchess B-ORG
. O
" O
He O

       | O

join O

" O
Your O

glad O

very O

said O
Mr. O
Rigby B-PERSON
  O
" O
I O
|
       | O
heard O
of O

this B-TIME

Harry B-PERSON
Coningsby I-PERSON
enclosed O
me O
a O
letter O
for O
his O
grandfather O
, O
and O
|
       | O
tells O
me O
that O
he O
and O
Henry B-PERSON
Sydney I-PERSON
had O
just O
had O
a O
capital O
run O
with O
the O
King O

the O
Duchess B-ORG
. O
" O
Once O
he O
was O
often O

       | O
here O

a O
great O
favorite O

hardly O

more O
interesting O

" O

  | O
" O
Yes O
, O
I O
have O
done O
a O
great O
deal O
for O
him O
, O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Rigby B-PERSON
. O
" O
Lord O
Monmouth B-PERSON
is O
fond O
of O
him O
and O

       | O
wishes O
that O
he O
should O
make O
a O
figure O

how O
any O

very O

" O
said O
the O
Duchess B-ORG
, O
smiling O
. O
" O
I O
thought O
that O

Mr. O

very O

       | O
gallantly O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
should O

sorry O

such O
a O

giving O

quite O
a O
glowing O
report O
of O

We O
were O

" O
| 
  | O
At O
this O
moment O
the O
Duke O
entered O
, O
apparently O
agitated O
. O
He O
bowed O
to O
his O
guests O

apologized O

       | O
for O
his O
unusual O
absence O

The O

There O

full O

In O

all O

original O
character O
of O
wildness O

and O
seclusion O

Sometimes O
the O
green O
earth O
was O
thickly O
studded O
with O
groves O
of O
huge O

vigorous O

       | O
oaks O
, O
intersected O
with O
those O
smooth O

sunny O
glades O
that O
seem O

if O
they O
must O
be O
cut O
for O

       | O
dames O

knights O

Then O
again O

spread O

yourself O

wilderness O
girt O

around O

rushed O
into O

Coningsby B-PERSON
raised O
his O
eyes O
from O
the O
turf O
on O
which O
they O
had O
|
       | O
been O
long O
fixed O
in O
abstraction O
, O
and O
he O
observed O
that O
the O
azure O
sky O
had O
vanished O
, O
a O
thin O
white O
|
       | O

suddenly O
spread O
itself O
over O

the O

with O
a O
sad O
and O
fitful O

       | O
gust O

| 
  | O
He O
had O
some O
reason O
to O
believe O
that O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
opposite O
wood O
, O
the O
forest O
was O

       | O
intersected O
by O
a O
public O
road O
, O
and O
that O
there O
were O
some O
habitations O
. O
Immediately O
rising O
, O
he O
|
       | O
descended O
at O
a O
rapid O
pace O
into O
the O
valley O
, O
passed O
the O
lake O
, O

struck O
into O

ascending O
wood O
of O
the O
bank O
opposite O

on O

he O
had O
mused O
away O
some O
precious O

       | O
time O
. O
| 
   | O
the O
beech O
shrieked O
, O
the O
elm O
sent O
forth O
its O
deep O

long O

drawn O
groan O
  O

       | O
ever O

, O
amid O
a O
momentary O
pause O
, O
the O
passion O
of O
the O
ash O
was O
heard O
in O
moans O
of O
thrilling O

       | O
anguish O
. O
| 
  | O
Coningsby O
hurried O
on O
, O
the O
forest O
became O
less O
close O
. O
All O
that O
he O
aspired O
to O
was O
to O
gain O
more O

       | O
open O
country O
. O
Now O
he O
was O
in O
a O
rough O
flat O
land O
covered O
only O
here O
and O
there O
with O
some O
dwarf O

bounded O
at O
no O

distance O
by O
a O
barren O
hill O
of O
moderate O
elevation O
. O
|
       | O
He O
gained O
its O
height O
with O
ease O
. O
He O
looked O
over O
a O
vast O
open O
country O
, O
like O

wild O
common O
  O
in O

in O
the O

black O
as O

private O

for O
the O

they O
offered O
him O
. O
Only O
eggs O

bacon O
  O

       | O
but O
very O
welcome O
to O
a O
pedestrian O
and O
a O
hungry O
one O
. O
| 
  | O
As O
he O
stood O
at O
the O
window O
of O
his O
little O
apartment O
, O
watching O
the O
large O
drops O
that O
were O
the O

       | O
heralds O
of O
the O
coming O

, O
and O
waiting O
for O
his O
repast O
, O
a O
flash O
of O
lightning O
illumined O

       | O
the O
whole O
country O
, O
and O
a O
horseman O
at O
full O
speed O
, O
followed O
by O
his O
groom O
, O
galloped O
up O
to O
the O

       | O
door O

   | O
of O

with O
an O
impressive O

       | O
of O
great O
intelligence O

  | O
" O
I O
am O
glad O
that O
we O
have O
both O
escaped O
the O

said O
the O
stranger O
  O
" O

greatly O

" O
He O
slightly O
and O
graciously O
bowed O
as O
he O
spoke O
in O
a O
voice O

       | O
of O
remarkable O
clearness O
  O

his O
manner O
, O

was O
touched O
with O
a O
degree O
of O

" O

added O
the O
stranger O

Then O
looking O
through O
the O
window O
, O
he O
said O
: O

Coningsby O

was O
born O
in O

age O
of O
infidelity O
in O
all O

his O
heart O
assured O

       | O
him O
that O
a O
want O

a O

But O
his O

intellect O
could O
not O
take O

       | O
refuge O
in O
that O

in O

He O
needed O

why O

despised O

Why O

Mr. O

not O

up O

something O

perfectly O

never O

range O
of O
hills O

Their O
crest O

abrupt O
termination O

enclosed O
table O

themselves O
: O
trooping O
down O
in O
the O
evening O

the O

Some O
of O
them O
indeed O

sight O

       | O
of O
those O
who O
were O
in O
the O
valley O

you O
might O
often O
observe O
various O
groups O
clustered O
on O
the O

       | O
green O
heights O
above O
the O
mansion O

the O
effect O
of O

was O
most O
inspiriting O
and O
graceful O
. O

       | O
Sometimes O
in O
the O

form O
, O
magnified O

the B-TIME
illusive I-TIME

a O
view O
over O
an O
extensive O

richly O
cultivated O

       | O
country O
. O
It O
was O
through O
this O
district O
that O
the O
party O
from O

had O
pursued O
their O
way O

brilliant O

extent O

forth O
a O
general O
cry O
of O
wonder O

praise O

The O

The O
gay O

rang O
frequently O
in O
the O

were O
her O
sunny O
eyes O
directed O

He O
was O
deeply O

watched O
the O
magic O

a O
sweet O
seriousness O

was O
most O
winning O
  O
and O
sometimes O
a O
burst O
of O

       | O
energy O
, O
a O
trait O

course O

sometimes O
wished O
nothing O

Apart O
from O

, O
he O
frequently O
felt O
himself O

pensive O

vaguely O
disquieted O

under O

would O
have O
been O
adapted O
to O
his O
mood O

did O
not O
compensate O

       | O
the O
absence O
of O

that O
strange O

Sometimes O
the O
countenance O
of O

       | O
Theresa O

flitted O
over O

That O

the O

The O
only O
difference O
between O
men O

in O
this O
respect O
is O
, O

       | O
that O

a O
trifling O

airy O
passion O
compared O
with O
the O
vast O

       | O
voracity O
of O
appetite O

Coningsby B-PERSON

not O

a O
sort O

that O
the O
stranger O

discoursing O

He O
turned O
to O

took O
up O

maintained O
what O

wanted O
some O
amusement O

" O
| 
  | O
What O
a O
confession O
! O
What O
a O
revelation O
to O
Coningsby B-PERSON
of O
his O
infinite O
insignificance O
! O
Coningsby B-PERSON
|
       | O
entertained O
a O
great O
aversion O
for O
Mr. O
Melton B-PERSON
, O
but O
felt O
his O
spirit O
unequal O
to O
the O
social O
|
       | O
contest O
. O
The O
genius O
of O
the O
untutored O
inexperienced O
youth O
quailed O
before O
that O
of O
the O
long O
|
       | O
practised O
, O
skillful O
, O
man O
of O
the O
world O
. O
What O
was O
the O
magic O
of O
this O
man O
? O
What O
was O
the O
secret O
of O
|
       | O
this O
ease O
, O
that O
nothing O
could O
disturb O
and O
yet O
was O
not O
deficient O
in O
deference O
and O
good O
taste O
? O
|
       | O
And O
then O
his O
dress O
, O
it O
seemed O
fashioned O
by O
some O
unearthly O
artist O
  O
yet O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
|
       | O
detect O
the O
unobtrusive O
causes O
of O
the O
general O
effect O
that O
was O
irresistible O
. O
Coningsby B-PERSON
's O
coat O
|
       | O
was O
made O
by O
Stultz B-PERSON
  O
almost O
every O
fellow O
in O
the O
sixth B-ORDINAL
form O
had O
his O
coats O
made O
by O
Stultz B-PERSON
  O
yet O
|
       | O
Coningsby B-PERSON
fancied O
that O
his O
own O
garment O
looked O
as O
if O
it O
had O
been O
furnished O
by O
some O
rustic O
|
       | O
slopseller O
. O
He O
began O
to O
wonder O
where O
Mr. O
Melton B-PERSON
got O
his O
boots O
from O
, O
and O
glanced O
at O
his O
own O
, O
|
       | O
which O
though O
made O
in O
St. B-GPE
James I-GPE
' I-GPE
Street I-GPE
, O
seemed O
to O
him O
to O
have O
a O
cloddish O
air O
. O
| 
   | O
intended O
to O
have O
remained O
at O
Beaumanoir B-PERSON
until O
that O
time O
  O
but O
suddenly O
it O
|
       | O
occurred O
to O
him O
, O
that O
the O
Age O
of O
Ruins O
was O
past O
, O
and O
that O
he O
ought O
to O
seize O
the O
opportunity O

       | O
of O
visiting O
Manchester B-GPE

was O

A O

Is O

it O
that O

A O
cloud O
passed O
over O

nothing O

with O
an O
air O
of O

CHAPTER O
IV O
. O

  | O
The O
village O
clock O
struck O
five B-CARDINAL
as O
Mr. O
Millbank B-PERSON
and O
his O
guest O
entered O
the O
gardens O
of O
|
       | O
his O
mansion O
. O
Coningsby B-PERSON
lingered O
a O
moment O
to O
admire O
the O
beauty O
and O
gay O
profusion O
of O
the O
|
       | O
flowers O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Your O
situation O
, O
" O
said O
Coningsby B-PERSON
, O
looking O
up O
the O
green O
and O
silent O
valley O
, O
" O
is O
absolutely O
|
       | O
poetic O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
try O
sometimes O
to O
fancy O
, O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Millbank B-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
rather O
fierce O
smile O
, O
" O
that O
I O
am O
in O

       | O
the B-EVENT

World I-EVENT

" O
| 
   | O
" O
Papa O
! O
papa O
! O
" O
and O
instantly O
a O
young O
girl O
came O
bounding O
down O
the O
stairs O
, O
but O
|
       | O
suddenly O
seeing O
a O
stranger O
with O
her O
father O
she O
stopped O
upon O
the O
landing O
place O
and O
was O
|
       | O
evidently O
on O
the O
point O
of O
as O
rapidly O
retreating O
as O
she O
had O
advanced O
, O
when O
Mr. O
Millbank B-PERSON
waved O
|
       | O
his O
hand O
to O
her O
and O
begged O
her O
to O
descend O
. O
She O
came O
down O
slowly O
: O
as O
she O
approached O
them O
her O
|
       | O
father O
said O
: O
" O
A O
friend O
you O
have O
often O
heard O
of O
Edith B-PERSON
: O
this O
is O
Mr. O
Coningsby B-PERSON
. O
" O
| 
  | O
She O
started O
  O
blushed O
very O
much O
  O
and O
then O
, O
with O
a O
trembling O
and O
uncertain O
gait O
, O
advanced O
, O
|
       | O
put O
forth O
her O
hand O
with O
a O
wild O
unstudied O
grace O
, O
and O
said O
in O
a O
tone O
of O
sensibility O
: O
" O
How O
often O

       | O
have O
we O
all O
wished O

  | O
This O
daughter O
of O
his O
host O
was O
of O
tender O
years O
  O
apparently O
she O
could O
scarcely O
have O
counted O
|
       | O
sixteen B-DATE
summers I-DATE
. O
She O
was O
delicate O
and O
fragile O
, O
but O
as O
she O
raised O
her O
still O
blushing O
visage O
to O
|
       | O
her O
father O
's O
guest O
, O
Coningsby B-PERSON
felt O
that O
he O
had O
never O
beheld O
a O
countenance O
of O
such O
striking O

       | O
and O
such O
peculiar O
beauty O

" O
| 
  | O
But O
the O
beauty O
of O
the O
countenance O
was O
not O
the O
beauty O
of O
the O
Saxons B-NORP
. O
It O
was O
a O
radiant O
face O
, O
|
       | O
one O
of O
those O
that O
seem O
as O
if O
touched O
in O
their O
cradle O
by O
a O
sunbeam O
, O
and O
to O

retained O
all O

       | O
its O
brilliancy O

suffused O

One B-MONEY

with O
delicate O
splendour O
, O
in O
the O
southern O
regions O
of O
France B-GPE

Her O
eye O
too O
was O
the O
rare O
eye O
of O

       | O
Acquitaine O
  O
soft O

long O
, O
with O

  | O
" O
Mr. O

Millbank B-ORG
to O
his O

  | O
" O
If O

pardon O
this O
dress O

said O
Coningsby B-PERSON
, O
bowing O
an O
apology O
for O
his O
|
       | O
inevitable O
frock O
and O
boots O
  O
the O
maiden O
raised O
her O
eyes O
and O
bent O
her O
head O
. O
| 
   | O
came O
somewhat O
suddenly O
into O
the O
room O
. O
She O
was O
playing O
with O
her O
dog O
, O
but O
ceased O
|
       | O
the O
moment O
she O
observed O
Coningsby B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
Coningsby B-PERSON
, O
who O
since O
his O
practice O
with O
Lady B-PERSON
Everingham I-PERSON
, O
flattered O
himself O
that O
he O
had O
|
       | O
advanced O
in O
small O
talk O
, O
and O
was O
not O
sorry O
that O
he O
had O
now O
an O
opportunity O
of O
proving O
his O
|
       | O
prowess O
, O
made O
some O
lively O
observations O
about O
pets O
and O
the O
breeds O
of O
lap O
- O
dogs O
, O
but O
he O
was O
not O
|
       | O
fortunate O
in O
extracting O
a O
response O
or O
exciting O
a O
repartee O
. O
He O
began O
then O
on O
the O
beauty O
of O
|
       | O
Millbank O
, O
which O
he O
would O
on O
no O
account O
have O
avoided O
seeing O
, O
and O
inquired O
when O
she O
had O
last O
|
       | O
heard O
of O
her O
brother O
. O
The O
young O
lady O
, O
apparently O
much O
distressed O
, O
was O
murmuring O
something O
|
       | O
about O
Antwerp B-GPE
, O
when O
the O
entrance O
of O
her O
father O
relieved O
her O
from O
her O
embarrassment O
. O
| 
  | O
Dinner O
being O
announced O
, O
Coningsby B-PERSON
offered O
his O
arm O
to O
his O
fair O
companion O
, O
who O
took O
it O
with O
|
       | O
her O
eyes O
fixed O
on O
the O
ground O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
You O
are O
very O
fond O
, O
I O
see O
, O
of O
flowers O
, O
" O
said O
Coningsby B-PERSON
, O
as O
they O
moved O
along O
  O
and O
the O
young O
|
       | O
lady O
said O
, O
" O
Yes O
. O
" O
| 
   | O
The O
young O
hostess O
seemed O
to O
perform O
her O
office O
with O
a O
certain O
degree O
of O
|
       | O
desperate O
determination O
. O
She O
looked O
at O
a O
chicken O
and O
then O
at O
Coningsby B-ORG
, O
and O
murmured O
|
       | O
something O
which O
he O
understood O
. O
Sometimes O
she O
informed O
herself O
of O
his O
tasted O
or O
necessities O
in O
|
       | O
more O
detail O
, O
by O
the O
medium O
of O
her O
father O
, O
whom O
she O
treated O
as O
a O
sort O
of O
dragoman O
  O
in O
this O
|
       | O
way O
: O
" O
Would O
not O
Mr. O
Coningsby B-PERSON
, O
papa O
, O
take O
this O
or O
that O
, O
or O
do O
so O
and O
so O
? O
" O
Coningsby B-PERSON
always O
|
       | O
was O
careful O
to O
reply O
in O
a O
direct O
manner O
without O
the O
agency O
of O
the O
interpreter O
  O
but O
he O
did O
not O
|
       | O
advance O
. O
Even O
a O
petition O
for O
the O
great O
honour O
of O
taking O
a O
glass O
of O
sherry O
with O
her O
only O
|
       | O
induced O
the O
beautiful O
face O
to O
bow O
. O
And O
yet O
when O
she O
had O
first B-ORDINAL
seen O
him O
, O
she O
had O
addressed O
him O
|
       | O
even O
with O
emotion O
. O
What O
could O
it O
be O
? O
He O
felt O
less O
confidence O
in O
his O
increased O
power O
of O
|
       | O
conversation O
. O
Why O
Theresa B-PERSON
Sydney I-PERSON
was O
scarcely O
a B-DATE
year I-DATE
older O
than O
Miss O
Millbank B-PERSON
, O
and O
though O
she O
|
       | O
did O
not O
certainly O
originate O
like O
Lady B-PERSON
Everingham I-PERSON
, O
he O
got O
on O
with O
her O
perfectly O
well O
. O
| 
   | O
fluently O
and O
well O
  O
on O
all O
subjects O
his O
opinions O
seemed O
to O
be O
decided O
, O
and O
his O
|
       | O
language O
was O
precise O
. O
He O
was O
really O
interested O
in O
what O
Coningsby B-PERSON
had O
seen O
, O
and O
what O
he O
had O
|
       | O
felt O
  O
and O
this O
sympathy O
divested O
his O
manner O
of O
the O
disagreeable O
effect O
that O
accompanies O
a O
|
       | O
tone O
inclined O
to O
be O
dictatorial O
. O
More O
than O
once O
Coningsby B-PERSON
observed O
the O
silent O
daughter O
|
       | O
listening O
with O
extreme O
attention O
to O
the O
conversation O
of O
himself O
and O
her O
father O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
dessert O
was O
remarkable O
. O
Millbank B-ORG
was O
very O
proud O
of O
his O
fruit O
. O
A O
bland O
expression O
of O
|
       | O
self O
- O
complacency O
spread O
over O
his O
features O
as O
he O
surveyed O
his O
grapes O
, O
his O
peaches O
, O
his O
|
       | O
figs O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Those O
grapes O
have O
gained O
a O
medal O
, O
" O
he O
told O
Coningsby B-PERSON
. O
" O
Those O
two B-CARDINAL
are O
prize O
peaches O

I O
have O

       | O
not O
yet O
been O
so O
successful O
with O
my O
figs O

however O
promise O

and O
perhaps O
this B-DATE

may O

       | O
be O
more O
fortunate O
. O
" O
|

" O
What O
would O
your O
brother O

myself O
have O
given O
for O
such O
a O
dessert O

Eton B-ORG
! O
" O
said O
Coningsby B-PERSON
|
       | O
to O
Miss O
Millbank B-PERSON
, O
wishing O
to O
say O
something O
, O
and O
something O
too O
that O
might O
interest O
her O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
seemed O
infinitely O
distressed O
, O
and O
yet O
this O
time O
would O
speak O
: O
| 
  | O
" O
Let O
me O
give O
you O
some O
. O
" O
He O
caught O
by O
chance O
her O
glance O
immediately O
withdrawn O
  O
yet O
it O
was O
a O
|
       | O
glance O
not O
only O
of O
beauty O
, O
but O
of O
feeling O
and O
thought O
. O
She O
added O
, O
in O
a O
hushed O
and O
hurried O
|
       | O
tone O
, O
dividing O
very O
nervously O
some O
grapes O
: O
" O
I O
hardly O
know O
whether O

why O

Opposite O
Coningsby O
was O
a O
portrait O

which O
had O
greatly O
attracted O
his O
attention O
during O
the O
|
       | O
whole O
dinner O
. O
It O
represented O
a O
woman O
extremely O
young O
and O
of O
a O
rare O
beauty O
. O
The O
costume O
was O
of O

       | O
that O
classical O
character O
prevalent O

this O
country O

chestnut O

The O
face O
was O
looking O
out O
of O
the O

       | O
canvass O
, O
and O
Coningsby B-PERSON
never O
raised O
his O
eyes O
without O
catching O
its O
glance O
of O
blended O
vivacity O

       | O
and O
tenderness O
. O
| 
  | O
There O
are O
moments O

is O
affected O
by O
circumstances O
of O
a O
very O
trivial O

       | O
character O

It O
seems O
a O
fantastic O
emotion O

but O
the O
gaze O
of O
this O
picture O
disturbed O
the O
serenity O

       | O
of O
Coningsby B-PERSON

He O
endeavoured O
sometimes O
to O
avoid O
looking O
at O
it O
, O

it O
irresistibly O
attracted O

       | O
him O
. O
More O
than O
once O
during O
the O
dinner O
he O
longed O
to O
inquire O
whom O
it O
represented O

it O
is O
a O

       | O
delicate O
subject O
to O
ask O
questions O
about O

and O
he O
refrained O
. O
Still O
when O
he O
was O
rising O
|
       | O
to O
leave O
the O
room O
, O
the O
impulse O
was O
irresistible O

He O
said O
to O
Mr. O

" O

The O
countenance O

was O
not O

reminiscence O

upon O

On O
the O
contrary O
, O
the O
expression O
was O
agitated O

       | O
almost O
angry O

  | O
" O

! O
that O
is O

moved O
away O

  | O
They O
found O
Miss B-PERSON

in O
the O
drawing O

She O
was O
sitting O

" O

" O

He O
addressed O
her O

There O
were O
several O
dolls O

       | O
he O
discovered O
, O
on O
examination O
, O
that O
they O
were O
pincushions O
  O
and O
elicited O
with O
some O
difficulty O
, O
|
       | O
that O
they O
were O
making O
for O

Then O
the O

and O
she O
rose O

       | O
Coningsby B-PERSON
also O
quitted O

There O
were O
several O

little O
embarrassed O

       | O
in O

up O

came O
forth O

       | O
receive O
him O

A O
superior O
servant O
inquired O
his O
name O
with O
a O
stately O
composure O
, O
that O
disdained O
to O

       | O
be O
supercilious O
. O
It O
was O
not O
without O
some O
degree O
of O
pride O

satisfaction O
that O
the O
guest O

replied O
, O
" O
Mr. O

" O
The O
instantaneous O
effect O
was O
magical O

It O
seemed O
to O
Coningsby B-PERSON
that O

       | O
he O
was O
borne O
on O
the O
shoulders O
of O

tried O
to O
carry O
some O
part O

       | O
of O

he O
only O
hoped O

CHAPTER O
VI O
. O
| 
   | O
seemed O
an O
overwhelming O
affair O

The O
sight O
of O
the O
servants O
bewildered O
him O
  O
how O

       | O
then O
was O
he O
to O
encounter O
their O
masters O

That O
however O
he O
must O
do O
in O
a O
moment O

A O
groom O

the O
chambers O
indicates O
the O
way O
to O
him O

as O

       | O
he O
proceeds O
with O
a O
hesitating O
yet O
hurried O
step O
through O
several O
ante O

chambers O

drawing O

doors O
are O
suddenly O
thrown O
open O

he O
is O
ushered O
into O
the O
largest O

       | O
most O
sumptuous O
saloon O
that O
he O
had O
ever O
entered O

Coningsby O

the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
in O
his O
life O
was O
at O
a O
great O
party O

His O
immediate O
emotion O
was O
to O
|
       | O
sink O
into O
the O
earth O
, O
but O
perceiving O
that O
no O
one O
even O
noticed O
him O
, O
and O
that O
not O
an O
eye O
had O

       | O
been O
attracted O
to O
his O
entrance O

he O
regained O
his O
breath O

in O
some O
degree O
his O
composure O
, O
and O
|
       | O
standing O
aside O
, O
endeavoured O
to O
make O
himself O
as O
well O
as O
he O
could O
master O
of O
the O
land O
. O

   | O
our O
young O
friend O
, O
by O
an O
inevitable O
association O
of O
ideas O

to O
remember O
that O
, O

       | O
unknown O

unnoticed O
as O

only O

       | O
the O
Lord O
of O
the O

himself O
  O
and O
he O
began O
to O
be O
rather O
ashamed O
of O
permitting O
a O
sense O
of O

       | O
his O
inexperience O
in O
the O
mere O
forms O

to O
oppress O
him O

as O
it O
were O
of O
the O
spirit O

Emboldened O

greatly O
restored O

indeed O
the O
chieftain O

as O

       | O
seemed O
somewhat O
ridiculous O

To O
address O
his O

serve O

make O

stiff O

unnatural O

What O

to O

greatly O
regarded O

       | O
often O
mentioned O
this O

one O
which O

combined O
with O
his O
great O
abilities O

       | O
so O
unusual O
at O

age O

In O
the O

it O

       | O
happened O

that O
while O

momentary O
diversion O
in O

graciously O
as O
the O

no O

She O
found O
her O
fate O
in O
an O
Englishman O

who O
was O
the O
father O
of O
her O
only O

       | O
child O
, O
a O
daughter O

She O
thought O
she O
had O
met O
in O
him O
a O
hero O
, O
a O
demi O
- O
god O
, O

of O

passion O

       | O
and O
original O
and O
creative O
mind O
  O
but O
he O
was O
only O
a O
voluptuary O
, O
full O
of O
violence O
instead O
of O
|
       | O
feeling O
, O
and O
eccentric O
because O
he O
had O
great O
means O
with O
which O
he O
could O
gratify O
extravagant O
|
       | O
whims O

Stella B-PERSON
found O
she O
had O
made O
the O
great O
and O
irretrievable O
mistake O
. O
She O
had O
exchanged O

       | O
devotion O
for O
a O
passionate O
and O
evanescent O
fancy O
, O
prompted O

Though O
not O
stainless O
in O
conduct O
, O
|
       | O
Stella B-PERSON
was O
pure O
in O
spirit O
. O
She O
required O
that O
devotion O
which O
she O
had O
yielded O
  O
and O
she O

       | O
separated O
herself O
from O
the O
being O
to O
whom O
she O
had O
made O
the O
most O
precious O
sacrifice O
. O
He O
offered O

       | O
her O
the O
consoling O
compensation O
of O
a O
settlement O
which O
she O
refused O
  O
and O
she O
returned O
with O
a O
|
       | O
broken O
spirit O
to O
that O
profession O
of O
which O
she O
was O
still O
the O
ornament O
and O
the O
pride O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
animating O
principle O
of O
her O
career O
was O
her O
daughter O
, O
whom O
she O
educated O
with O
a O
solicitude O

most O
virtuous O
mother O
could O
not O
surpass O

preserve O
her O
from O
the O
stage O
, O
and O
to O

       | O
secure O
for O
her O
an O
independence O
, O
were O
the O
objects O
of O
the O
mother O
's O
life O
  O
but O
nature O
whispered O

       | O
to O
her O
, O
that O
the O
days O
of O
that O
life O
were O
already O
numbered O
. O
The O
exertions O
of O
her O
profession O
had O
|
       | O
alarmingly O
developed O
an O
inherent O
tendency O
to O
pulmonary O
disease O
. O
Anxious O
that O
her O
child O
should O
|
       | O
not O
be O
left O
without O
some O
protector O
, O
Stella B-PERSON
yielded O
to O
the O
repeated O
solicitations O
of O
one B-CARDINAL
who O
|
       | O
from O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
had O
been O
her O
silent O
admirer O
, O
and O
she O
married O
Villebecque B-ORG
, O
a O
clever O
actor O
, O
and O
|
       | O
an O
enterprising O
man O
who O
meant O
to O
be O
something O
more O
. O
Their O
union O
was O
not O
of O
long O
duration O
, O
|
       | O
though O
it O
was O
happy O
on O
the O
side O
of O
Villebecque B-GPE
, O
and O
serene O
on O
that O
of O
his O
wife O
. O
Stella B-PERSON
was O
|
       | O
recalled O
from O
this O
world O
, O
where O
she O
had O
known O
much O
triumph O
and O
more O
suffering O
  O
and O
where O
she O
|
       | O
had O
exercised O
many O
virtues O
, O
which O
elsewhere O
, O
though O
not O
here O
, O
may O
perhaps O
be O
accepted O
as O
some O
|
       | O
palliation O
of O
one B-CARDINAL
great O
error O
. O
| 
  | O
Villebecque O
acted O
becomingly O
to O
the O
young O
charge O
which O
Stella B-PERSON
had O
bequeathed O
to O
him O
. O
He O
was O
|
       | O
himself O
, O
as O
we O
have O
intimated O
, O
a O
man O
of O
enterprise O
, O
a O
restless O
spirit O
, O
not O
content O
to O
move O
|
       | O
for O
ever O
in O
the O
sphere O
in O
which O
he O
was O
born O
. O
Vicissitudes O
are O
the O
lot O
of O
such O
aspirants O
. O
|
       | O
Villebecque O
became O
manager O
of O
a O
small O
theatre O
, O
and O
made O
money O

If O
Villebecque B-ORG

He O
took O
a O

even O
that O
succeeded O

Soon O
he O
was O
recognised O

as O
the O
lessee O

still O
he O
prospered O

Villebecque O
began O
to O
dabble O
in O

He O
enthroned O

had O
also O
to O
be O
the O
instructor O

It O
was O
a O
life O
of O
toil O
  O
an O

       | O
addition O
of O
labour O

he O
bore O
it O
all O
without O

all O
this O

He O
immediately O

believed O
that O

indeed O

Perhaps O
it O
was O
because O

it O

celebrity O

Their O

a O
fault O
rare O
with O

True O
it O

repugnance O

it O
certainly O

seemed O

nothing O

Coningsby B-PERSON

her O

announced O

A O

bearing O

came O
forward O

bowed O
to O
the O
Marquess O

Lord O

went O
immediately O

       | O
to O
the O

notified O

Madame O

wished O
him O
to O
be O
her O
beau O

| 
  | O
It O
was O
a O
very O
pretty O
theatre O
  O
had O
been O
rapidly O
rubbed O
up O
, O
and O
renovated O

there O
  O
the O

       | O
painting O
just O
touched O
  O
a O
little O
gilding O
on O
a O
cornice O

There O
were O
no O
boxes O
, O
but O
the O
ground O
|
       | O
floor O
which O
gradually O
ascended O
was O
carpeted O
, O
and O
covered O
with O
arm O
- O
chairs O
, O
and O
the O
back O
of O
the O
|
       | O
theatre O
with O
a O
new O
and O
rich O
curtain O
of O
green O
velvet O
. O
| 
  | O
They O
are O
all O
seated O
  O
a O
great O
artist O
performs O
on O
the O
violin O
, O
accompanied O
by O
another O
great O

       | O
artist O
on O
the O
piano O

The O
lights O
rise O
  O
somebody O
evidently O
crosses O
the O
stage O
behind O
the O
|
       | O
curtain O
. O
They O
are O
disposing O
the O
scene O
. O
In O
a O
moment O
the O
curtain O
will O
rise O
also O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Have O
you O
seen O
Lucretia B-PERSON
? O
" O
said O
the O
Princess O
to O
Coningsby O

" O
She O

resume O

" O
| 
  | O
But O
before O
he O
could O
answer O
the O
bell O
rang O
, O

the O
curtain O
rose O

approbation O

Her O
agitation O
is O
extreme O

she O
curtseys B-PERSON

bows O
her O
head O
, O
as O
if O
to O

       | O
hide O
her O
face O
. O
The O
face O
was O
pleasing O
, O
and O
pretty O
enough O
  O
soft O
and O
engaging O
. O
Her O
figure O
slight O
|
       | O
and O
graceful O
. O
Nothing O
could O
be O
more O
perfect O
than O
her O
costume O
  O
purely O
white O
, O
but O
the O
fashion O

       | O
consummate O
  O
a O
single O
rose O
her O
only O
ornament O

All O
admitted O
that O
her O
hair O
was O
arranged O
to O
|
       | O
admiration O
. O
| 
  | O
At O
length O
she O
spoke O
  O
her O
voice O
trembled O
, O
but O
she O
had O
a O
good O
elocution O
though O
her O
organ O
|
       | O
wanted O
force O
. O
The O
gentlemen O
looked O
at O
each O
other O
, O
and O
nodded O
approbation O
. O
There O
was O
something O
|
       | O
so O
unobstrusive O
in O
her O
mien O
, O
that O
she O
instantly O
became O
a O
favourite O
with O
the O
ladies O
. O
The O
scene O

       | O
was O
not O
long O
, O
but O
it O
was O
triumphant O
. O
| 
   | O
of O
youth O
. O
His O
dress O
too O
was O
admirable O

He O
had O
studied O
the O
most O
distinguished O
of O

       | O
his O
audience O
for O
the O
occasion O
, O
and O
had O
outdone O
them O
all O
. O
The O
fact O
is O
, O
he O
had O
been O
assisted O
a O
|
       | O
little O
by O
a O
great O
connoisseur O
, O
a O
celebrated O
French B-NORP

who O
had O
been O
one O
of O

The O
thing O
was O
perfect O
, O
and O
Lord O
Monmouth B-PERSON
took O
a O
pinch O
of O
snuff O

tapped O

       | O
approbation O
on O
the O
top O
of O
his O
box O

| 
   | O
of O
her O
tones O
thrilled O
from O
the O
heart O
: O
suddenly O
she O
clasped O
her O
hands O
with O
all O

       | O
the O
exhaustion O
of O
woe O
  O
an O
expression O
of O
agony O
flitted O
over O
her O
countenance O
  O
and O
she O
burst O

       | O
into O
tears O

Villebecque O
rushed O
forward O
, O
and O
carried O
rather O
than O
led O
her O
from O
the O
stage O
  O
the O

       | O
audience O
looking O
at O
each O
other O
, O
some O
of O
them O
suspecting O
that O
this O
movement O
was O
a O
part O

matured O

assisted O
by O
that O
absolute O

       | O
the O
compensatory O
possession O

He O

the O

bending O
to O
the O

" O
Remember O

" O
It O

leading O
her O
to O
the O

" O
Where O

only O

me O
what O

" O
| 
  | O
Coningsby O
felt O
the O
difference O
between O
the O
courtesy O
of O
the O
head O

of O

heart O
, O
as O
he O

       | O
contrasted O
the O
manner O
of O
Lucretia B-PERSON

Nothing O

more O

on O
the O

was O
rather O
agitated O

embarrassed O

did O
not O

Flora B-PERSON

as O
Augustina O
  O
the B-PRODUCT
Princess I-PRODUCT

began O
to O
imagine O
that O
Madame O

after O
all O

might O

so O

purpose O
, O

she O
had O
first B-ORDINAL
supposed O
. O
She O

       | O
therefore O
surprised O
Coningsby B-PERSON
with O
the O
almost O
affectionate O
moroseness O
with O
which O
, O
while O
she O

       | O
hated O
to O
sing O

she O
yet O
found O
pleasure O
in O
singing O
for O
him O
alone O
. O
And O
it O
is O
impossible O
to O
say O

what O

been O

not O
the O
very O
night O

on O
which O

had O
resolved O

commence O
the O
enchantment O
of O
Coningsby B-PERSON
, O
introduced O
to O
her O
|
       | O
Sidonia B-GPE
. O
| 
   | O
From O
the O
evening B-TIME
of O
his O
introduction O
, O
Sidonia B-GPE
sought O
the O
society O
of O
the O
|
       | O
Princess O
Lucretia O
. O
He O
could O
not O
complain O
of O
her O
reserve O
. O
She O
threw O
out O
her O
mind O
in O
various O
|
       | O
and O
highly O
cultivated O
intelligence O
. O
He O
recognised O
in O
her O
a O
deep O
and O
subtile O
spirit O
, O
|
       | O
considerable O
reading O
for O
a O
woman O
, O
habits O
of O
thought O
, O
and O
a O
soul O
passionate O
and O
daring O
. O
She O
|
       | O
resolved O
to O
subdued O
one O
whose O
appreciation O
she O
had O
gained O
, O
and O
who O
had O
subdued O
her O
. O
The O
|
       | O
profound O
meaning O
and O
the O
calm O
manner O
of O
Sidonia B-GPE
combined O
to O
quell O
her O
spirit O
. O
She O
struggled O
|
       | O
against O
the O
spell O
. O
She O
tried O
to O
rival O
his O
power O
  O
to O
cope O
with O
him O
, O
and O
with O
the O
same O
weapons O
. O
|
       | O
But O
prompt O
as O
was O
her O
thought O
and O
bright O
as O
was O
its O
expression O
, O
her O
heart O
beat O
in O
tumult O
  O
and O
|
       | O
with O
all O
her O
apparent O
serenity O
, O
her O
agitated O
soul O
was O
the O
prey O
of O
absorbing O
passion O
. O
She O
|
       | O
could O
not O
contend O
with O
that O
intelligent O
, O
yet O
inscrutable O
, O
eye O
  O
with O
that O
manner O
so O
full O
of O
|
       | O
interest O
and O
respect O
, O
and O
yet O
so O
tranquil O
. O
Besides O
they O
were O
not O
on O
equal O
terms O
. O
Here O
was O
a O

       | O
girl O
contending O
with O
a O
man O
learned O
in O
the O
world O

way O
. O

   | O
once O
occurred O

The B-TIME
morning I-TIME
after O
his O
arrival O
they O
went O
out O
|
       | O
shooting O
together O
. O
After O
a O
long O
ramble O
they O
would O
stretch O
themselves O
on O
the O
turf O
under O
a O
|
       | O
shady O
tree O
, O
often O
by O
the O
side O
some O
brook O
where O
the O
cresses O
grow O
, O
that O
added O
a O
luxury O
to O
their O
|
       | O
sporting O
meal O
, O
and O
then O
Coningsby B-PERSON
would O
lead O
their O
conversation O
to O
some O
subject O
on O
which O
|
       | O
Sidonia B-GPE
would O
pour O
out O
his O
mind O
with O
all O
that O
depth O
of O
reflection O
, O
variety O
of O
knowledge O
, O
and O
|
       | O
richness O
of O
illustrative O
memory O
, O
which O
distinguished O
him O
  O
and O
which O
offered O
so O
striking O
a O
|
       | O
contrast O
to O
the O
sharp O
talent O
, O
the O
shallow O
information O
, O
and O
the O
worldly O
cunning O
that O
make O

   | O
course O
well O

known O
that O
Sidonia B-GPE

       | O

of O
Mr. O

his O

Coningsby B-PERSON

       | O
together O
  O
and O
however O

find O
out O

indeed O

ever O

so O

, O
that O
Sidonia B-GPE
could O

       | O
only O
be O
her O

Madame O

no O

Lucretia B-PERSON

The B-WORK_OF_ART

Lucretia I-WORK_OF_ART
was O
a O
fine O
horsewoman O
, O
though O
she O
rarely O
joined O
the O
various O

that O

her O

       | O

, O
she O
met O
the O
equestrians O

Now O
she O
would O
ride O
with O
Sidonia B-GPE

Coningsby B-PERSON

and O
as O
a O

This O
was O

       | O
a O
fearful O
trial O
for O

but O
she O
encountered O

the O

solicitude O
of O

CHAPTER O

   | O
of O

It O
was O
agreed O
that O
the O
race O
should O
come O
off O
at O
once O
, O
before O
any O
|
       | O
of O
the O
present O
company O
, O
many O
of O
whom O
gave O
symptoms O
of O
being O
on O
the O
wing O
, O
had O
quitted O
the O
|
       | O
Castle O
. O
The O
young O
guardsman O
and O
Mr. O
Guy B-PERSON
Flouncey I-PERSON
had O
surveyed O
the O
country O
, O
and O
had O
selected O
a O
|
       | O
tract O
which O
they O
esteemed O
very O
appropriate O
for O
the O
scene O
of O
action O
. O
From O
a O
hill O
of O
common O
|
       | O
land O
you O
looked O
down O
upon O
the O
valley O
of O
Coningsby B-PERSON
richly O
cultivated O
  O
deeply O
ditched O
and O
|
       | O
stiffly O
fenced O
  O
the O
valley O
was O
bounded O
by O
another O
rising O
ground O
, O
and O
the O
scene O
was O
admirably O
|
       | O
calculated O
to O
give O
an O
extensive O
view O
to O
a O
multitude O
. O
| 
   | O
to O
side O
, O
with O
good O
taking O
off O
on O
both O
banks O
. O
This O
was O
the O
critical O
venture O
. O
| 
  | O
Lord O
Monmouth B-PERSON
highly O
approved O
the O
scheme O
, O
but O
mentioned O
that O
the O
sweepstakes O
must O
be O
|
       | O
moderate O
and O
open O
to O
the O
whole O
county O
. O
The O
neighbourhood O
had O
a B-DATE
week I-DATE
of O
preparation O
, O
and O
the O
|
       | O
entries O
for O
the O
Coningsby B-PERSON
steeple O
- O
chase O
were O
numerous O
. O
Lord O
Monmouth B-PERSON
after O
a O
reserve O
for O
his O
|
       | O
own O
account O
placed O
his O
stable O
at O
the O
service O
of O
his O
guests O
. O
For O
himself O
he O
offered O
to O
back O
|
       | O
his O
horse O
, O
Sir O
Robert B-PERSON
, O
which O
was O
to O
be O
ridden O
by O
his O
grandson O
. O
| 
  | O
Now O
nothing O
was O
spoken O
or O
thought O
of O
at O
Coningsby B-FAC
Castle I-FAC
except O
the O
coming O
sport O
. O
The O
|
       | O
ladies O
shared O
the O
general O
excitement O
. O
They O
embroidered O
handkerchiefs O
, O
and O
scarfs O
, O
and O
gloves O
, O
|
       | O
with O
the O
respective O
colours O
of O
the O
rivals O
, O
and O
tried O
to O
make O
jockey O
- O
caps O
. O
Lady O
St. O
Julians B-NORP
|
       | O
postponed O
her O
intended O
departure O
in O
consequence O
. O
Madame O
Colonna B-PERSON
wished O
that O
some O
means O
could O
|
       | O
be O
contrived O
by O
which O
they O
might O
all O
win O
. O
| 
   | O
he O
glanced O
rather O
sharply O
at O
the O
brook O
, O
and O
on O
his O
return O
to O
the O
Castle B-ORG
he O
sent O
|
       | O
a O
despatch O
for O
some O
of O
his O
stud O
. O
| 
  | O
Coningsby B-PERSON
was O
all O
anxiety O
to O
win O
. O
He O
was O
proud O
of O
the O
confidence O
of O
his O
grandfather O
in O
|
       | O
backing O
him O
. O
He O
had O
a O
powerful O
horse O
and O
a O
first B-ORDINAL
- O
rate O
fencer O
, O
and O
he O
was O
resolved O
himself O
not O
|
       | O
to O
flinch O
. O
On O
the B-TIME
night I-TIME
before O
the O
race O
retiring O
somewhat O
earlier O
than O
usual O
to O
his O
chamber O
, O
|
       | O
he O
observed O
on O
his O
dressing O
- O
table O
a O
small O
packet O
addressed O
to O
his O
name O
, O
and O
in O
an O
unknown O
|
       | O
hand O
- O
writing O
. O
Opening O
it O
he O
found O
a O
very O
pretty O
jockey O
whip O
embroidered O
with O
his O
colours O
of O
|
       | O
pink O
and O
white O
. O
This O
was O
a O
perplexing O
circumstance O
, O
but O
he O
fancied O
it O
on O
the O
whole O
a O
happy O
|
       | O
omen O
. O
And O
who O
was O
the O
donor O
? O
Certainly O
not O
the O
Princess O
Lucretia O
, O
for O
he O
had O
observed O
her O
|
       | O
fashioning O
some O
maroon O
ribands O
which O
were O
the O
colours O
of O
Sidonia B-GPE

It O
could O
scarcely O
be O
from O

       | O
Mrs. O

Perhaps O

please O
— O
the O
Marquess O
? O
Thinking O
over O
this O
incident O

       | O
he O
fell O
asleep O
. O
| 
   | O
Among O
them O
was O
an O
Arab B-NORP
mare O

Coningsby B-PERSON
recognised O
the O
Daughter O
of O
the O
Star O
. O
She O
|
       | O
was O
greatly O
admired O
for O
her O
points O
  O
but O
Guy B-PERSON
Flouncey I-PERSON
whispered O
to O
Mr. O
Melton B-PERSON
that O
she O
never O
|
       | O
could O
do O
the O
work O
. O
| 
  | O
" O

great O

rather O
better O

Mr. O
Guy B-PERSON

indeed O
did O
not O

seem O
quite O
so O
limber O

flexible O
as O
usual O
  O

the O
young O
guardsman O
, O
who O
had O
previously O

       | O
discoursed O

an O
almost O
alarming O
style O
of O
the O
perils O

feats O
of O
the O
Kildare B-PERSON
country O

had O

no O

rather O

the O
impending O

an O
exaggeration O

It O
seemed O

so O

there O
were O

calculated O
whether O

always O
a O
principal O

not O

       | O
for O

Mr. O

it O
all O

little O
more O
pale O
and O
pensive O
than O

, O

       | O
listened O
with O
tranquillity O
to O

discourse O

. O
This O
notice O
of O
her O
return O
to O
her O
own O
country O
seemed O
to O
|
       | O
occasion O
the O
Marquess B-PERSON
great O
disquietude O
. O
| 
   | O
was O
extremely O
anxious O
to O
know O
which O
way O
the O
wind O
blew O
, O
and O
the O
mission O
with O
|
       | O
which O
he O
had O
been O
entrusted O
, O
fell O
in O
precisely O
with O
his O
inclinations O

necessities O
. O
The O
|
       | O
Marquess O
listened O
to O
the O
communication O
and O
sighed O
, O
then O
turned O
gently O
round O
and O
surveyed O
|
       | O
himself O
in O
the O
mirror O
and O
sighed O
again O
, O
then O
said O
to O
Rigby B-PERSON
: O
| 
  | O
" O
You O
understand O
exactly O
what O
I O
mean O

is O
quite O
ridiculous O

going O

" O
| 
   | O
or O
more O
content O
, O

more O

As O
for O
the O
Marquess B-PERSON
himself O
, O
Mr. O
Rigby B-PERSON
|
       | O
never O
remembered O
him O
more O
serene O
and O
even O
joyous O
. O
His O
Lordship O
scarcely O
ever O
entered O
general O
|
       | O
society O
. O
The O
Colonna B-PERSON
family O
remained O
in O
strict O
seclusion O
  O
and O
he O
preferred O
the O
company O
of O

       | O
these O
accomplished O
and O
congenial O
friends O
to O
the O
mob O
of O
the O
great O
world O
. O
| 
  | O
Between O
Madame O
Colonna O

Mr. O
Rigby B-PERSON
there O
had O
always O
subsisted O
considerable O
confidence O
. O
|
       | O
Now O
, O
that O
gentleman O
seemed O
to O
have O
achieved O
fresh O
and O
greater O
claims O
to O
her O
regard O
. O
In O
the O
|
       | O
pleasure O
with O
which O
he O
looked O
forward O
to O
her O
approaching O
alliance O
with O
his O
patron O
, O
he O
|
       | O
reminded O
her O
of O
the O
readiness O
with O
which O
he O
had O
embraced O
her O
suggestions O
for O
the O
marriage O
of O
|
       | O
her O
daughter O
with O
Coningsby B-PERSON
. O
Always O
obliging O
, O
she O
was O
never O
wearied O
of O
chaunting O
his O
praises O
|
       | O
to O
her O
noble O
admirer O
, O
who O
was O
apparently O
much O
gratified O
she O
should O
have O
bestowed O
her O
esteem O
|
       | O
on O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
whom O
she O
would O
necessarily O
in O
after O
life O
see O
so O
much O
. O
It O
is O
seldom O
the O
lot O
of O
|
       | O
husbands O
that O
their O
confidential O
friends O
gain O
the O
regards O
of O
their O
brides O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
am O
delighted O
you O
all O
like O
Rigby B-PERSON

" O
said O
Lord O

" O

" O
| 
  | O
The O
remembrance O
of O
the O
Hellingsley B-ORG
failure O
seemed O
to O
be O
quite O
erased O
from O
the O
memory O
of O
the O

       | O
Marquess O

Rigby B-PERSON
never O
recollected O

confidential O
, O
and O
more O
equable O
in O
his O

       | O
manner O

He O
told O
Rigby B-PERSON
one B-DATE
day I-DATE

that O
he O
wished O
that O

What O
a O
hint O

That O

some O

researches O

even O
meditated O
a O
rapid O
tour O
to O
mature O
his O

       | O
inventions O
  O
but O
his O
confidence O
in O
his O
native O
taste O
and O
genius O
, O
ultimately O
convinced O
him O
that O
|
       | O
this O
movement O
was O
unnecessary O

The O

received O
them O
with O

       | O
consideration O
. O
He O
had O
got O
them O
a O
candidate O

and O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
high O

— O
the O
son O
of O

and O

       | O
connected O

eyes O
sparkled O

A O
real O
honourable O

If O
they O
liked O

       | O
he O
would O
introduce O
them O
immediately O
to O
the O
Honourable O
Alberic B-PERSON
de I-PERSON
Crecy I-PERSON
. O
He O
had O
only O
to O
|
       | O
introduce O
them O
, O
as O
there O
was O
no O
difficulty O
either O
as O
to O
means O
or O
opinions O
, O

or O

   | O
were O
what O
is O
sometimes O
emphatically O
styled O
flabbergasted O
  O
they O
were O
speechless O
|
       | O
from O
bewilderment O
. O
" O
Mr. O
de B-PERSON
Crecy I-PERSON
will O
go O
for O
the O
ballot O
, O
" O
said O
the O
secretary O
of O
the O
Treasury B-ORG

       | O
with O
an O
audacious O
eye O

" O
and O
for O
Total O
and O
Immediate O
if O
you O
press O
him O
hard O
  O
|
       | O
but O
do O
n't O
if O
you O
can O
help O
it O
, O
because O
he O
has O
an O
uncle O
, O
an O
old O
county O
member O
who O
has O
|
       | O
prejudices O
, O
and O
might O
disinherit O
him O
. O
However O
, O
we O
answer O
for O
him O
. O
And O
I O
am O
very O
happy O
that O
I O
|
       | O
have O
been O
the O
means O
of O
bringing O
about O
an O
arrangement O
, O
which O
I O
feel O
will O
be O
mutually O
|
       | O
advantageous O
. O
" O
And O
so O
saying O
the O
secretary O
effected O
his O
escape O
. O
| 
   | O
with O
a O
letter O
to O
the O
Independent O
Electors O
from O
Mr. O
Millbank B-PERSON
the O
new O
proprietor O
|
       | O
of O
Hellingsley B-ORG
. O
| 
  | O
He O
expressed O
himself O
as O
one O
not O
anxious O
to O
obtrude O
himself O
on O
their O
attention O
and O
founding O
|
       | O
no O
claim O
to O
their O
confidence O
on O
his O
recent O
acquisition O
  O
but O
at O
the O
same O
time O
as O
one O
resolved O
|
       | O
that O
the O
free O
and O
enlightened O
community O
, O
with O
which O
he O
must O
necessarily O
hereafter O
be O
much O
|
       | O
connected O
, O
should O
not O
become O
the O
nomination O
Borough O
of O
any O
Peer O
of O
the O
realm O
without O
a O
|
       | O
struggle O
if O
they O
chose O
to O
make O
one O
. O
And O
so O
he O
offered O
himself O
if O
they O
could O
not O
find O
a O
better O
|
       | O
candidate O
without O
waiting O
for O
the O
ceremony O
of O
a O
requisition O
. O
He O
was O
exactly O
the O
man O
they O

       | O
wanted O
  O
and O
though O
he O
had O
" O
no O
handle O
to O
his O
name O
, O
" O
and O
was O
somewhat O
impracticable O
about O

       | O
pledges O
, O
his O
fortune O
was O
so O
great O
, O
and O
his O
character O
so O
high O
, O
that O
it O
might O
be O
hoped O
that O
the O

       | O
people O
would O
be O
almost O
as O
content O
as O
if O
they O
were O
appealed O

by O
some O
obscure O
scion O

factitious O
nobility O
subscribing O
to O
political O
engagements O
which O
he O
could O
not O
comprehend O
, O
and O

       | O
which O
in O

the O
contagion O
of O
popular O

the O

divided O
into O
two B-CARDINAL
parties O
, O
the O
|
       | O
vast O
majority O
of O
which O
were O
firmly O
convinced O
that O
the O
country O
could O
only O
be O
saved O
by O
the O

       | O
return O
of O
Mr. O
Rigby B-PERSON

preserved O
from O

their O
minds O
without O
duly O
weighing O
the O
respective O
merits O
of O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
rivals O
. O

       | O
This O
class O
of O
deeply O
meditative O
individuals O
are O
distinguished O
not O
only O
by O
their O
pensive O
turn O
|
       | O
of O
mind O
  O
but O
by O
a O
charitable O
vein O
that O
seems O
to O
pervade O
their O
being O
. O
Not O
only O
will O
they O
think O

       | O
of O
your O
request O

for O
their O
parts O

sides O
equally O
well O

Decision O
indeed O
, O
as O

       | O
it O
must O
dash O
the O
hopes O
of O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
their O
solicitors O
, O
seems O
infinitely O
painful O
to O
them O
  O
they O
|
       | O
have O
always O
a O
good O
reason O
for O
postponing O
it O
. O
If O
you O
seek O
their O
suffrage O
during O
the O
canvass O
, O
|
       | O
they O
reply O
that O

down O

the B-DATE
day I-DATE
of O

If O
you O

call O
again O
to O
inform O
them O
that O
the O
writ O
has O
arrived O
, O
they O
rejoin O
that O
perhaps O
after O
all O
there O

       | O
may O
not O
be O
a O

an O

CHAPTER O
VI O
. O
| 
   | O
her O
development O
with O
interest O
  O
and O
had O
witnessed O
her O
launched O
in O
that O
world O
|
       | O
where O
she O
floated O
at O
once O
with O
as O
much O
dignity O
and O
consciousness O
of O
superior O
power O
, O
as O
if O
she O
|
       | O
had O
braved O
for O
seasons O
its O
waves O
and O
its O
tempests O
. O
| 
   | O
serpent O
  O
indeed O
there O
was O
an O
undulating O
movement O
in O
Lucretia B-PERSON
when O
she O
|
       | O
approached O
you O
, O
which O
irresistibly O
reminded O
you O
of O
that O
mysterious O
animal O
. O
| 
  | O
Lord O
Monmouth B-PERSON
was O
not O
insensible O
to O
the O
spell O
, O
though O
totally O
unconscious O
of O
its O
purpose O
. O
|
       | O
He O
found O
the O
society O
of O
Lucretia B-PERSON
very O
agreeable O
to O
him O
  O
she O
was O
animated O
, O
intelligent O
, O
|
       | O
original O
  O
her O
inquiries O
were O
stimulating O
  O
her O
comments O
on O
what O
she O
saw O
, O
and O
heard O
, O
and O
read O
, O
|
       | O
racy O
and O
often O
indicating O
a O
fine O
humour O
. O
But O
all O
this O
was O
reserved O
for O
his O
ear O
. O
Before O
her O
|
       | O
parents O
as O
before O
all O
others O
, O
Lucretia B-PERSON
was O
silent O
, O
a O
little O
scornful O
, O
never O
communicating O
, O
|
       | O
neither O
giving O
nor O
seeking O
amusement O
, O
shut O
up O
in O
herself O
. O
| 
   | O
which O
represented O
in O
his O
mind O
a O
continuance O
of O
good O
eating O
and O
good O
drinking O
, O
|
       | O
fine O
horses O
, O
luxurious O
baths O
, O
unceasing O
billiards O
. O
| 
  | O
In O
this O
state O
of O
affairs O
appeared O
Sidonia B-GPE
, O
known O
before O
to O
her O
step O
- O
mother O
, O
but O
seen O
by O
|
       | O
Lucretia B-PERSON
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
. O
Truly O
he O
came O
, O
saw O
, O
and O
conquered O
. O
Those O
eyes O
that O
rarely O
met O
|
       | O
anothers O
, O
were O
fixed O
upon O
his O
searching O
yet O
unimpassioned O
glance O
. O
She O
listened O
to O
that O
voice O
|
       | O
full O
of O
music O
, O
yet O
void O
of O
tenderness O
: O
and O
the O
spirit O
of O
Lucretia B-PERSON
Colonna I-PERSON
bowed O
before O
an O
|
       | O
intelligence O
that O
commanded O
sympathy O
, O
yet O
offered O
none O
. O
| 
   | O
ever O
been O
instilled O
into O
her O
being O
. O
Frequent O
absence O
from O
her O
own O
country O
had O
|
       | O
by O
degrees O
broken O
off O
even O
an O
habitual O
observance O
of O
the O
forms O
of O
her O
creed O
  O
while O
a O
life O
of O
|
       | O
undisturbed O
indulgence O
, O
void O
of O
all O
anxiety O
and O
care O
, O
while O
it O
preserved O
her O
from O
many O
of O
the O
|
       | O
temptations O
to O
vice O
, O
deprived O
her O
of O
that O
wisdom O
" O
more O
precious O
than O
rubies O
" O
which O
adversity O
|
       | O
and O
affliction O
, O
the O
struggles O
and O
the O
sorrows O
of O
existence O
, O
can O
alone O
impart O
. O

   | O
that O
required O
no O
formal O
exposition O
, O
no O
proofs O
and O
illustrations O
, O
no O
comment O
and O
|
       | O
no O
gloss O
  O
which O
was O
indeed O
rather O
a O
traditional O
conviction O
than O
an O
imparted O
dogma O
  O
that O
the O
|
       | O
exoterick O
public O
were O
on O
many O
subjects O
the O
victims O
of O
very O
vulgar O
prejudices O
, O
which O
these O
|
       | O
enlightened O
personages O
wished O
neither O
to O
disturb O
nor O
to O
adopt O
. O

  | O
A O
being O
of O
such O
a O
temper O
, O
bred O
in O
such O
a O
manner O
  O
a O
woman O
full O
of O
intellect O
and O
ambition O
, O

       | O

and O
lawless O
, O
and O

with O
prosperity O

is O
not O
made O
for O
equable O
fortunes O
and O
an O
|
       | O
uniform O
existence O
. O
She O
would O
have O
sacrificed O
the O
world O
for O
Sidonia B-GPE
, O
for O
he O
had O
touched O
the O
|
       | O
fervent O
imagination O
that O
none O
before O
could O
approach O
, O
but O
that O
inscrutable O
man O
would O
not O
read O
|
       | O
the O
secret O
of O
her O
heart O
, O
and O
prompted O
alike O
by O
pique O
, O
the O
love O
of O
power O
, O
and O
a O
weariness O
of O
|
       | O
her O
present O
life O
, O
Lucretia B-PERSON
resolved O
on O
that O
great O
result O
which O
Mr. O
Rigby B-PERSON
is O
now O
about O
to O
|
       | O
communicate O
to O
the B-LOC
Princess I-LOC
Colonna I-LOC
. O
| 
   | O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O
The O
sound O
even O
reached O
the O
Marquess O
in O
his O
luxurious O
recess O
, O
|
       | O
who O
immediately O
took O
a O
pinch O
of O
snuff O
and O
ordered O
his O
valet O
to O
lock O
the O
door O
of O
the O
|
       | O
ante O
- O
chamber O
. O
The O
Princess O
Lucretia O
too O
heard O
the O
sounds O
  O
she O
was O
lying O
on O
a O
sofa O
in O
her O
|
       | O
boudoir O
reading O
the O
Inferno B-LOC
and O
immediately O
mustered O
her O
garrison O
in O
the O
form O
of O
a O
French B-NORP
|
       | O
maid O
, O
and O
gave O
directions O
that O
no O
one O
should O
be O
admitted O
. O
Both O
the O
Marquess B-PERSON
, O
and O
his O
intended O
|
       | O
bride O
, O
felt O
that O
a O
crisis O
was O
at O
hand O
, O
and O
resolved O
to O
participate O
in O
no O
scenes O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
ringing O
ceased O
  O
there O
was O
again O
silence O
. O
Then O
there O
was O
another O
ring O
  O
a O
very O
short O
, O
|
       | O
hasty O
, O
and O
violent O
pull O
  O
followed O
by O
some O
slamming O
of O
doors O
. O
The O
servants O
, O
who O
were O
all O
on O

       | O
the O
alert O
and O
had O
advantages O
of O
hearing O
and O
observation O
denied O
to O
their O
secluded O
master O
, O
|
       | O
caught O
a O
glimpse O
of O
Mr. O
Rigby B-PERSON
endeavouring O
gently O
to O
draw O
back O
into O
her O
apartments O
Madame O
|
       | O
Colonna B-PERSON
, O
furious O
amid O
his O
deprecatory O
exclamations O
. O
| 
   | O
you O
— O
you O
are O
quite O
wrong O
— O
you O
are O
indeed O

it O
is O
a O
complete O
misapprehension O

explain O
everything O

I O
entreat O

I O

       | O
listen O

Then O
the O
lady O
with O
a O
mantling O
visage O
and O
flashing O
eye O
, O
violently O
closing O
the O
door O
, O
was O
|
       | O
again O
lost O
to O
their O
sight O
. O
A B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
after O
, O
there O
was O
a O
more O
moderate O

Mr. O

       | O
coming O
out O

The O

received O
the O
intimation O
indeed O
from O
Coningsby B-PERSON
at O

sufficient O
art O
to O
conceal O
her O

       | O
emotion O
. O
Lord O
Monmouth B-PERSON
himself O
was O
quite O

at O

an O
excellent O

so O
rich O

He O
had O

always O

        | O
/ O

something O
to O
tell O

, O
was O
the O
best O
man O
in O
the O

Lady B-PERSON

was O

       | O
conversation O
with O
the O

Count O

on O
casually O

        | O
/ O

observed O
entering O

She O
just O
caught O
his O
form O
bowing O

the O
Duchess B-ORG

       | O
and O
instantly O
turned O
her O

and O
replunged O
into O
her O
conversation O
with O
increased O
interest O
. O
|
       | O
Lady O
Monmouth B-PERSON
was O
a O
person O
who O
had O
the O
power O
of O
seeing O
all O
about O
her O
, O
everything O
and O

       | O
everybody O
, O
without O
appearing O

She O
was O
conscious O
that O
Sidonia B-GPE

approaching O
her O

       | O
neighbourhood O
. O
Her O
heart O
beat O
in O

dreaded O

the O
eye O

wings O
in O

       | O
society O
under O
the O
maternal O
eye O

She O
was O
surprised O
by O
the O
extreme O
interest O
which O
her O
grand O

       | O
neighbour O
suddenly O
took O
in O
all O
her O

in O

Sidonia B-GPE

reached O
the O

But O
no O
, O
it O
|
       | O
was O
to O
the O
Count O

not O
to O
Lady O

that O
he O
was O
advancing O

After O
some O
little O
time O
when O

accustomed O

voice O
, O
and O
found O
her O

       | O
heart O
throbbing O
with O
less O
violence O
, O
Lucretia B-PERSON
turned O

as O

by O
accident O
to O
the O
Count B-ORG
, O
|
       | O
and O
met O
the O
glance O
of O
Sidonia B-GPE

She O
meant O
to O
have O
received O
him O
with O
haughtiness O
, O
but O
her O

her O
  O
and O
slightly O
rising O
from O
the O

she O
welcomed O
him O
with O
a O

       | O
countenance O
of O
extreme O
pallor O
and O
with O
some O
awkwardness O
. O

  | O
His O
manner O
was O
such O
as O
might O
have O
assisted O
her O
, O
even O
had O
she O
been O
more O
troubled O
. O
It O
was O
|
       | O
marked O
by O
a O
degree O
of O
respectful O
friendliness O
. O
He O
expressed O
without O
reserve O
his O
pleasure O
at O

meeting O
her O
again O
  O
inquired O
much O
how O
she O
had O
passed O
her O
time O
since O
they O
last O
parted O
  O
asked O

       | O
more O

greatly O
relieved O
her O
. O
She O
expressed O
to O
him O
how O
kind O
her O
Lord O

       | O
consider O
his O
society O

His O

left O
him O

The O

love O
one O

her O

still O
her O

prompted O

would O
seem O

fantastic O
passion O

a O
degree O
of O
reverence O

almost O
of O
affection O

which O
seemed O

       | O
occasionally O

It O
was O
a O

       | O
recollection O

a O
courtesy O
that O
evidently O
greatly O

Villebecque O
talked O
very O

very O

though O

       | O
listened O
with O
great O
earnestness O

Coningsby B-PERSON
told O
her O
that O

heard O
she O
was O

       | O
too O
much O

counselled O
her O
to O
gaiety O

But O
nature O
that O

made O
her O
mild O

denied O

her O

sensible O

the O
accents O

sought O

she O

the O
Marquess B-PERSON

he O
bent O
forward O
to O
her O

took O
her O
hand O

" O

she O
again O

a O
voice O
of O
inquiry O
. O

" O

The B-WORK_OF_ART
Marquess I-WORK_OF_ART
took O
a O
pinch O
of O
snuff O
. O

There O
was O
an O
awkward O
pause O
in O
the O
chamber O

" O
I O
think O

" O

rather O
dryly O
. O

  | O
" O
You O

yourself O
again O

" O
said O
Sidonia B-GPE
, O
advancing O

   | O
with O
an O
air O
of O
stupor O

" O
I O

would O
daunt O

then O
after O
a O

CHAPTER O
VI O
. O
| 
  | O
After O
the O
conversation O
at O
dinner O
which O
we O
have O
noticed O
, O
the O
restless O
and O
|
       | O
disquieted O
Coningsby B-PERSON
wandered O
about O
Paris B-GPE
, O
vainly O
seeking O
in O
the O
distraction O
of O
a O
great O
city O
|
       | O
some O
relief O
from O
the O
excitement O
of O
his O
mind O
. O
His O
first B-ORDINAL
resolution O
was O
immediately O
to O
depart O
|
       | O
for O
England B-GPE
  O
but O
when O
, O
on O
reflection O
, O
he O
was O
mindful O
that O
after O
all O
, O
the O
assertion O
which O
had O
|
       | O
so O
agitated O
him O
might O
really O
be O
without O
foundation O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
many O
circumstances O
that O
to O
|
       | O
his O
regardful O
fancy O
seemed O
to O
accredit O
it O
, O
his O
firm O
resolution O
began O
to O
waver O
. O
| 
   | O
Coningsby B-PERSON
had O
ever O
experienced O
  O
and O
they O
revealed O
to O
him O
the O
immensity O
of O
the O
|
       | O
stake O
which O
he O
was O
hazarding O
on O
a O
most O
uncertain O
die O
. O
| 
   | O
infinitely O
wretched O
, O
scarcely O
able O
to O
guide O
his O
steps O
, O
dreading O
even O
to O
meet O
an O
|
       | O
acquaintance O
, O
and O
almost O
feeling O
that O
his O
tongue O
would O
refuse O
the O
office O
of O
conversation O
, O
he O
|
       | O
contrived O
to O
reach O
his O
grandfather O
's O
hotel O
, O
and O
was O
about O
to O
bury O
himself O
in O
his O
chamber O
, O
|
       | O
when O
on O
the O
staircase O
he O
met O
Flora B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
Coningsby B-PERSON
had O
not O
seen O
her O
for O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
fortnight I-DATE
. O
Seeing O
her O
now O
, O
his O
heart O
smote O
him O
for O
|
       | O
his O
neglect O
, O
excusable O
as O
it O
really O
was O
. O
Any O
one O
else O
at O
this O
time O
, O
he O
would O
have O
hurried O
by O
|
       | O
without O
recognition O
, O
but O
the O
gentle O
and O
suffering O
Flora B-PERSON
was O
too O
meek O
to O
be O
rudely O
treated O
by O
|
       | O
so O
kind O
a O
heart O
as O
Coningsby B-PERSON
's O
. O
| 
  | O
He O
looked O
at O
her O
  O
she O
was O
pale O
and O
agitated O
. O
Her O
step O
trembled O
, O
while O
she O
still O
hastened O
|
       | O
on O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
What O
is O
the O
matter O
? O
" O
inquired O
Coningsby B-PERSON
. O
| 
   | O
turned O
with O
her O
  O
but O
they O
had O
scarcely O
emerged O
from O
the O
court O
- O
yard O
when O
the O
|
       | O
carriage O
approached O
that O
brought O
Lord O
and O
Lady B-PERSON
Monmouth I-PERSON
home O
. O
They O
followed O
it O
into O
the O
|
       | O
court O
. O
They O
were O
immediately O
at O
its O
door O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
All O
is O
right O
, O
Harry B-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
the O
Marquess B-PERSON
, O
calm O
and O
grave O
. O
| 
  | O
Coningsby B-PERSON
pressed O
his O
grandfather O
's O
hand O
. O
Then O
he O
assisted O
Lucretia B-PERSON
to O
alight O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
am O
quite O
well O
, O
" O
she O
said O
, O
" O
now O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
But O
you O
must O
lean O
on O
me O
, O
dearest O
Lady O
Monmouth B-PERSON
, O
" O
Coningsby B-PERSON
said O
in O
a O
tone O
of O
great O
|
       | O
tenderness O
, O
as O
he O
felt O
Lucretia B-PERSON
almost O
sinking O
from O
him O
. O
And O
he O
supported O
her O
into O
the O
hall O
|
       | O
of O
the O
hotel O
. O
| 
  | O
Lord O
Monmouth B-PERSON
had O
lingered O
behind O
. O
Flora B-PERSON
crept O
up O
to O
him O
, O
and O
with O
unwonted O
boldness O
|
       | O
offered O
her O
arm O
to O
the O
Marquess O
. O
He O
looked O
at O
her O
with O
a O
glance O
of O
surprise O
, O
and O
then O
a O
|
       | O
soften O
expression O
, O
one B-CARDINAL
indeed O
of O
an O
almost O
winning O
sweetness O
, O
which O
, O
though O
rare O
, O
was O
not O
a O
|
       | O
stranger O
to O
his O
countenance O
, O
melted O
his O
features O
, O
and O
taking O
the O
arm O
so O
humbly O
presented O
, O
he O
|
       | O
said O
: O
| 
  | O
" O
Ma O
Petite O
, O
you O
look O
more O
frightened O
than O
any O
of O
us O
. O
Poor O
child O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
He O
had O
reached O
the O
top O
of O
the O
flight O
of O
steps O
  O
he O
withdrew O
his O
arm O
from O
Flora B-GPE
, O
and O
thanked O
|
       | O
her O
with O
all O
his O
courtesy O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
You O
are O
not O
hurt O
then O
, O
sir O
? O
" O
she O
ventured O
to O
ask O
with O
a O
look O
which O
expressed O
the O
infinite O
|
       | O
solicitude O
, O
which O
her O
tongue O
did O
not O
venture O
to O
convey O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
By O
no O
means O
, O
my O
good O
little O
girl O
  O
" O
and O
he O
extended O
his O
hand O
to O
her O
, O
which O
she O
reverently O
|
       | O
bent O
over O
and O
embraced O

       | O
with O

But O
he O
felt O

source O
of O
mortification O

Sir O

To O

was O
impossible O
  O
they O
met O
face O

  O
and O
Sir O
Joseph B-PERSON
stopped O
, O
and O

       | O
immediately O
reminded O

that O

three B-DATE

him O

him O

it O
seemed O

Edith B-PERSON
, O
though O
she O
said O
not O
as O
much O
, O
|
       | O
felt O
the O

. O
And O
Coningsby B-PERSON
turned O
round O
and O
walked O
with O
them O
. O
He O
told O
them O

with O
unaffected O

an O
expression O
of O
disappointment O
which O
she O
in O
vain O

       | O
attempted O
to O
conceal O
. O

" O
The O

said O
Coningsby B-PERSON
with O
that O
plaintive O

lived O
in O

in O
a O
large O
hotel O
, O
that O
, O
in O
old B-DATE
days I-DATE
, O
had O
|
       | O
belonged O
to O
the O
Crillons B-ORG
  O
but O
it O
had O
received O
at O
his O
hands O
such O
extensive O
alterations O
, O
that O
|
       | O
nothing O
of O
the O
original O
decoration O
, O
and O
little O
of O
its O
arrangement O
, O
remained O
. O
| 
   | O
that O
was O
wafted O
about O
. O
A O
gallery O
led O
from O
this O
hall O
to O
an O
inner O
hall O
of O
quite O
a O
|
       | O
different O
character O
  O
fantastic O
, O
glittering O
, O
variegated O
  O
full O
of O
strange O
shapes O
and O
dazzling O
|
       | O
objects O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
roof O
was O
carved O
and O
gilt O
in O
that O
honeycomb O
style O
prevalent O
in O
the O
Saracenic B-PRODUCT
buildings O
  O
|
       | O
the O
walls O
were O
hung O
with O
leather O
stamped O
in O
rich O
and O
vivid O
patterns O
  O
the O
floor O
was O
a O
flood O
of O
|
       | O
mosaic O
  O
about O
were O
statues O
of O
negroes O
of O
human O
size O
with O
faces O
of O
wild O
expression O
, O
and O
|
       | O
holding O
in O
their O
outstretched O
hands O
silver O
torches O
that O
blazed O
with O
an O
almost O
painful O
|
       | O
brilliancy O
. O
| 
  | O
From O
this O
inner O
hall O
, O
a O
double O
staircase O
of O
white O
marble O
, O
led O
to O
the O
grand O
suite O
of O

       | O
apartments O
. O
| 
   | O
landscapes O
, O
or O
on O
the O
azure O

Ægean B-NORP

From O
the O
ceiling O
beautiful O
|
       | O
divinities O
threw O
garlands O
on O
the O
guests O
, O
who O
seemed O
surprised O
that O
the O
roses O
, O
unwilling O
to O
|
       | O
quit O
Olympus B-ORG
, O
would O
not O
descend O
on O
earth O
. O
The O
general O
effect O
of O
this O
fair O
chamber O
was O
|
       | O
heightened O
too O
by O
that O
regulation O
of O
the O
house O
which O
did O
not O
permit O
any O
benches O
in O
the O
|
       | O
ball O
- O
room O
. O
That O
dignified O
assemblage O
who O
are O
always O
found O
ranged O
in O
precise O
discipline O
|
       | O
against O
the O
wall O
, O
did O
not O
here O
mar O
the O
flowing O
grace O
of O
the O
festivity O
. O
The O
chaperons O
had O
no O
|
       | O
cause O
to O
complain O
. O
A O
large O
saloon O
abounded O
in O
ottomans B-NORP
and O
easy O
chairs O
at O
their O
service O
, O
|
       | O
where O
their O
delicate O
charges O
might O
rest O
when O
weary O
, O
or O
find O
distraction O
when O
not O
engaged O
. O
| 
  | O
All O
the O
world O
were O
at O
this O
fête O
of O
Sidonia B-GPE
. O
It O
exceeded O
in O
splendour O
and O
luxury O
every O
|
       | O
entertainment O
that O
had O
yet O
been O
given O
. O
The O
highest O
rank O
, O
even O
Princes O
of O
the O
blood O
, O
beauty O
, O
|
       | O
fashion O
, O
fame O
— O
all O
assembled O
in O
a O
magnificent O
and O
illuminated O
palace O
, O
resounding O
with O
|
       | O
exquisite O
melody O
. O
| 
   | O
stamped O
upon O
his O
brain O
. O
Tender O
as O
were O
his O
years O
, O
when O
he O
was O
separated O
from O
|
       | O
her O
, O
he O
could O
yet O
recal O
the O
very O
phrases O
in O
which O
she O
deplored O
her O
isolation O
  O
and O
there O
were O
|
       | O
numerous O
passages O
in O
her O
letters O
which O
alluded O
to O
it O
. O
Coningsby B-PERSON
had O
taken O
occasion O
to O
sound O
|
       | O
the O
Wallingers O
on O
this O
subject O
  O
but O
he O
felt O
assured O
from O
the O
manner O
in O
which O
his O
advances O
|
       | O
were O
met O
, O
that O
they O
knew O
nothing O
of O
his O
mother O
, O
and O
attributed O
the O
hostility O
of O
Mr. O
Millbank B-PERSON
|
       | O
to O
his O
grandfather O
solely O
to O
political O
emulation O
and O
local O
rivalries O
. O
Still O
there O
was O
the O
|
       | O
portrait O
and O
the O
miniature O
. O
That O
was O
a O
fact O
  O
a O
clue O
which O
ultimately O
, O
he O
was O
persuaded O
, O
must O
|
       | O
lead O
to O
some O
solution O
. O
| 
   | O
moment O
therefore O
that O
he O
found O
himself O
in O
the O
saloons O
of O
Sidonia B-GPE
, O
he O
was O
|
       | O
accosted O
by O
many O
whose O
notice O
was O
flattering O
  O
but O
his O
eye O
wandered O
, O
while O
he O
tried O
to O
be O
|
       | O
courteous O
and O
attempted O
to O
be O
sprightly O
. O
Where O
was O
she O
? O
He O
had O
nearly O
reached O
the O
ball O
- O
room O
|
       | O
when O
he O
met O
her O
. O
She O
was O
on O
the O
arm O
of O
Lord O
Beaumanoir B-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
made O
her O
acquaintance O
at O
|
       | O
Rome B-GPE
, O
and O
originally O
claimed O
it O
as O
the O
member O
of O
a O
family O
who O
, O
as O
the O
reader O
may O
perhaps O
not O
|
       | O
forget O
, O
had O
experienced O
some O
kindnesses O
from O
the O
Millbanks B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
There O
were O
mutual O
and O
hearty O
recognitions O
between O
the O
young O
men O
  O
great O
explanations O
where O
|
       | O
they O
had O
been O
, O
what O
they O
were O
doing O
, O
where O
they O
were O
going O
. O
Lord O
Beaumanoir B-PERSON
told O
Coningsby B-PERSON
he O
|
       | O
had O
introduced O
steeple O
- O
chaces O
at O
Rome B-GPE
, O
and O
had O
parted O
with O
Sunbeam B-ORG

the O
nephew O
of O
a O

       | O
her O
aunt O
. O
| 
  | O
Lady B-PERSON

indulging O
in O
some O
Roman B-NORP

" O

as O
for O

No O

But O
now O
his O
feelings O
were O
ethereal O

He O
loved O

passionately O
— O
and O
he O
loved O
in O
a O
scene O

in O
a O

society O

All O

       | O
that O
he O

worthy O

fantastic O
dwellings O
, O
among O
which O
his O
life O
now O
|
       | O
glided O
as O
in O
some O
dainty O
and O
gorgeous O
masque O
. O

   | O
feelings O

the O
cultivation O

       | O
tastes O
  O
and O
the O
enjoyment O
of O
a O

which O
their O
own O

hearts O
made O
them O

       | O
both O
comprehend O

Ambition O
lost O
much O
of O
its O
splendour O
, O
even O
his O
lofty O
|
       | O
aspirations O
something O
of O
their O
hallowing O
impulse O
of O
paramount O
duty O
, O
when O
Coningsby B-PERSON
felt O
how O
|
       | O
much O
ennobling O
delight O
was O
consistent O
with O
the O
seclusion O
of O
a O
private O
station O
  O
and O
mused O
over O
|
       | O
an O
existence O
to O
be O
passed O
amid O
woods O
and O
waterfalls O
with O
a O
fair O
hand O
locked O
in O
his O
  O
or O
|
       | O
surrounded O
by O
his O
friends O
in O
some O
ancestral O
hall O
. O
| 
   | O
thinking O
of O
things O
even O
sweeter O
  O
listening O
to O
delicious O
songs O
, O
and O
sometimes O
|
       | O
reading O
aloud O
some O
bright O
romance O
, O
or O
some O
inspiring O
lay O

   | O
meet O
, O
and O
glances O
are O
withdrawn O
: O
the O
tongue O
may O
speak O
idly O
, O
the O
eye O
is O
more O
|
       | O
eloquent O
  O
and O
often O
more O
true O
. O
| 
  | O
Coningsby O
looked O
up O
  O
Lady B-PERSON
Wallinger I-PERSON
who O
had O
more O
than O
once O
announced O
, O
that O
she O
was O
going O
to O
|
       | O
put O
on O
her O
bonnet O
, O
was O
gone O
. O
Yet O
still O
he O
continued O
to O
talk O
trifles O
  O
and O
still O
Edith B-PERSON
|
       | O
listened O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Of O
all O
that O
you O
have O
told O
me O
, O
" O
said O
Edith B-PERSON
, O
" O
nothing O
pleases O
me O
so O
much O
as O
your O
description O

       | O
of O
St. B-FAC
Geneviève I-FAC

How O
much O
I O
should O
like O

catch O
the O
deer O
at O

the O
heights O

What O
a O

  | O
" O
You O
would O
like O
Eustace B-PERSON
Lyle I-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
Coningsby B-PERSON
. O
" O
He O
is O
so O
shy O

yet O
so O
ardent O

" O
You O
have O
such O
a O
band O

Oswald B-PERSON

saying O
this B-TIME

was O
no O

       | O
so O

" O

  | O
" O
We O
are O
all O
united O

the O
only O
bond O
of O
friendship O
  O

yet O
friendship O

   | O
" O
you O

" O
We O
come O

And O
yet O
they O
did O
not O
move O

There O
were O
yet O
a O
few O
pencil O
touches O
to O
be O
given O
to O
the O
tinted O

" O
Would O
you O
give O
me O

" O
some O
slight O
memorial O
of O

I O
would O
not O

venture O

hope O
for O
anything O
half O
so O
beautiful O
as O
this O

the O
slightest O
sketch O

I O
should O
so O

       | O
like O
when O
away O

have O
it O
hanging O
in O
my O
room O

" O
| 
  | O
A O
blush O
suffused O
the O
cheek O
of O
Edith B-PERSON
, O
she O
turned O
her O
head O
a O
little O
aside O
, O
as O
if O
she O
were O

       | O
arranging O
some O
drawings O
. O
And O
then O
she O
said O
in O
a O
somewhat O
hushed O

hesitating O
voice O
, O

" O
I O
am O
sure O
I O
will O
do O
so O
  O

with O
pleasure O

A O
view O
of O
the O
Hall O
itself O
  O
I O
think O
that O
would O

       | O
be O
the O
best O
memorial O

Where O
shall O
we O
take O
it O
from O

We O
will O
decide O
in O
our O
walk O

" O
and O
she O
rose O
, O

       | O
and O
promising O
immediately O
to O
return O
, O
left O
the O
room O

   | O
father O
of O
Edith B-PERSON

A O
light O
step O
roused O
him O
  O
she O
had O
returned O
, O
Unconsciously O
he O
|
       | O
greeted O
her O
with O
a O
glance O
of O
ineffable O
tenderness O
. O

  | O
They O
went O
forth O
  O
it O
was O
a O
grey O
, O
sultry O
day O
. O
Indeed O
it O
was O
the O
covered O
sky O

had O
led O
to O

the O
fishing O

       | O
the O
Darl B-PERSON

renowned O
for O
its O
sport O

They O
lingered O
before O
they O
reached O
the O
terrace O
where O
they O
|
       | O
were O
to O
find O
Lady B-PERSON

observing O
the O

points O

the O
Hall O
presented O
, O

form O
the O
subject O
of O
Coningsby B-PERSON

was O

not O
merely O
a O
sketch O

a O
drawing O

the O
most O
finished O

the O
bright O

effective O
pencil O

Edith B-PERSON

Edith B-PERSON
of O
the O
justness O
of O
his O
opinion O
. O
To O
the O
fishing O
cottage O
therefore O
they O
|
       | O
bent O
their O
steps O
. O
They O
emerged O
from O
the O
gardens O
into O
the O
Park O
, O
sauntering O
over O
the O
table O
|
       | O
land O
, O
and O
seeking O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
the O
shade O
in O
the O
soft O
but O
oppressive O
atmosphere O
. O
At O
the O
|
       | O
limit O
of O
the O
table O
land O
their O
course O
lay O
by O
a O
wild O
and O
winding O
path O
through O
a O
gradual O
and O
|
       | O
wooded O
declivity O
. O
While O
they O
were O
yet O
in O
this O
craggy O
and O
romantic O
woodland O
, O
the O
big O
, O
fervent O
|
       | O
drops O
began O
to O
fall O
. O
Coningsby B-PERSON
urged O
Edith B-PERSON
to O
seek O
at O
once O
a O
natural O
shelter O
  O
but O
she O
, O
who O
|
       | O
knew O
the O
country O
, O
assured O
him O
that O
the O
fishing O
cottage O
was O
close O
by O
, O
and O
that O
they O
might O
|
       | O
reach O
it O
before O
the O
rain O
could O
do O
them O
any O
harm O
. O
| 
   | O
low O
, O
dark O
roof O
of O
the O
fishing O
cottage O
on O
its O
banks O
. O
They O
descended O
from O
the O
|
       | O
woods O
to O
the O
margin O
of O
the O
stream O
, O
by O
a O
flight O
of O
turfen O
steps O
, O
Coningsby B-PERSON
holding O
Edith B-PERSON
's O
|
       | O
hand O
as O
he O
guided O
her O
progress O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
drops O
became O
thicker O
  O
they O
reached O
, O
at O
a O
rapid O
pace O
, O
the O
cottage O
. O
The O
absent O
boat O
|
       | O
indicated O
that O
Sir O
Joseph B-PERSON
and O
Oswald B-PERSON
were O
on O
the O
river O
. O
The O
cottage O
was O
an O
old O
building O
of O
|
       | O
rustic O
logs O
, O
with O
a O
very O
shelving O
roof O
so O
that O
you O
might O
obtain O
sufficient O
shelter O
without O
|
       | O
entering O
its O
walls O
. O
Coningsby B-PERSON
found O
a O
rough O
garden O
seat O
for O
Edith B-PERSON
. O
The O
shower O
was O
now O
|
       | O
violent O
. O
| 
   | O
the O
stream O
  O
a O
glowing O
light O
fell O
upon O
the O
woods O
and O
waters O
  O
the O
perfume O
of O
|
       | O
trees O
and O
flowers O
and O
herbs O
floated O
around O
. O
There O
was O
a O
carolling O
of O
birds O
  O
a O
hum O
of O
happy O
|
       | O
insects O
in O
the O
air O
  O
freshness O
and O
stir O
, O
and O
a O
sense O
of O
joyous O
life O
, O
pervaded O
all O
things O
  O
it O
|
       | O
seemed O
that O
the O
heart O
of O
all O
creation O
opened O

Coningsby O
, O
after O
repeatedly O
watching O
the O
shower O
with O
Edith B-PERSON
, O
and O
speculating O
on O
its O
progress O

       | O
which O
did O
not O
much O
annoy O
them O
, O
had O
seated O
himself O
on O
a O
log O
almost O
at O
her O
feet O
. O
And O
assuredly O
|
       | O
a O
maiden O
and O
a O
youth O
more O
beautiful O

engaging O
had O
seldom O
met O
before O
in O
a O
scene O
more O
fresh O
|
       | O
and O
fair O
. O
Edith B-PERSON
on O
her O
rustic O
seat O
watched O
the O
now O
blue O
and O
foaming O
river O
, O
and O
the O
birch O
|
       | O
trees O
with O
a O
livelier O
tint O
, O
and O
quivering O
in O
the O
sunset O
air O
  O
an O
expression O
of O
tranquil O
bliss O
|
       | O
suffused O
her O
beautiful O
brow O
, O
and O
spoke O
from O
the O
thrilling O
tenderness O
of O
her O
soft O
dark O
eye O
. O
|
       | O
Coningsby O
gazed O
on O
that O
countenance O
with O
a O
glance O
of O
entranced O
rapture O
. O
His O
cheek O
was O

       | O
flushed O
, O
his O
eye O
gleamed O
with O
dazzling O
lustre O
. O
She O
turned O
her O
head O
, O
she O
met O
that O
glance O

season O
of O
meditation O

Her O
heart O
was O
still O
agitated O
by O
the O
tremulous O
admission O
|
       | O
that O
she O
responded O
to O
that O
fervent O
and O
adoring O
love O
whose O
eloquent O
music O
still O
sounded O
in O
her O
|
       | O
ear O
, O
and O
the O
pictures O
of O
whose O
fanciful O
devotion O
flitted O
over O
her O
agitated O
vision O
. O
|
       | O
Unconsciously O
she O
pressed O
the O
arm O
of O
Coningsby B-PERSON
as O
the O
servant O
spoke O
, O
and O
then O
without O
looking O
|
       | O
into O
his O
face O
, O
whispering O
him O
to O
be O
quick O
, O
she O
sprang O
away O
. O

  | O
As O
for O
Coningsby B-PERSON
, O
notwithstanding O
the O
elation O
of O
his O
heart O
, O
and O
the O
ethereal O
joy O
which O
|
       | O
flowed O
in O
all O
his O
veins O
, O
the O
name O
of O
Mr. O
Millbank B-PERSON
sounded O
something O
like O
a O
knell B-ORG
. O
However O
|
       | O
this O
was O
not O
the O
time O
to O
reflect O
. O
He O
obeyed O
the O
hint O
of O
Edith B-PERSON
  O
made O
the O
most O
rapid O
toilette O
|
       | O
that O
ever O
was O
consummated O
by O
a O
happy O
lover O
, O
and O
in O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
entered O
the O
drawing O

room O
of O
|
       | O
Hellingsley O
  O
to O
encounter O
the O
gentleman O
whom O
he O
hoped O
by O
some O
means O
or O
other O
, O
quite O
|
       | O
inconceivable O
, O
might O
some B-DATE
day I-DATE
be O
transformed O
into O
his O
father O

in O

and O
the O

of O

       | O
his O
consequent O
duties O

keeping O
him O

taken O
a O

" O

  | O
Coningsby B-PERSON
looked O
round O
to O
the O
kind O
Lady B-PERSON
Wallinger I-PERSON
, O
and O
half O
addressed O
his O
murmured O
answer O
|
       | O
to O
her O
, O
explaining O
how O
they O
had O
lost O
her O
, O
and O
their O
way O
, O
and O
were O
caught O
in O
a O
storm O
or O
a O

       | O
shower O
, O
which O
as O
it O
terminated O
about B-TIME
three I-TIME
hours I-TIME
back O
, O
and O
the O
fishing O
cottage O
was O
little O

       | O
more O
than O
a O
mile O
from O
the O
Hall B-FAC
, O
very O
satisfactorily O
accounted O
for O
their O
not O
being O
in O

for O

       | O
dinner O

   | O
who O
in O

him O

making O
a O

inconvenient O
effort O

reach O

       | O
them O
by O
dinner O

  O
to O
please O

surprise O
them O
  O
and O
finding O
them O
all O
dispersed O
, O
dinner O
so O

       | O
late O
, O
that O
he O
might O
have O
reached O
home O
in O
good O
time O
without O
any O
great O
inconvenient O
effort O
, O
his O

       | O
daughter O

he O
has O
wished O
a B-CARDINAL

taking O
a O
singularly O
long O
ramble O
with O

       | O
no O

a O
young O

he O
did O
not O

expect O

see O
  O
all O

       | O
are O
circumstances O

slight O
, O
and O
yet O
encountered O
collectively O
, O
it O
may O
be O

       | O
doubted O
whether O
they O
would O
not O
a O

ruffle O
even O
the O

his O
niece O

Coningsby B-PERSON
put O
his O
arm O
round O
the O
astonished O
neck O
of O
Oswald B-PERSON
as O
if O
they O

       | O

" O
By O

my O
dear O

he O
exclaimed O

" O
I O
am O
so O
sorry O

kept O
your O

   | O
him O

On O

went O
on O
flowingly O
enough O
. O
The O
gentlemen O
indeed O
|
       | O
stayed O
much O
longer O
over O
their O
wine O
than O
on O
the B-DATE
preceding I-DATE
days I-DATE
, O
and O
Coningsby B-PERSON
did O
not O
venture O

       | O
on O
the O
liberty O
of O
quitting O
the O
room O
before O
his O
host O
. O
It O
was O
as O
well O
. O
Edith B-PERSON
required O
repose O
. O
|
       | O
She O
tried O
to O
seek O
it O
on O
the O
bosom O
of O
her O
aunt O
, O
as O
she O
breathed O
to O
her O
the O
delicious O
secret O
of O
|
       | O
her O
life O

When O
the O
gentlemen O
returned O
to O
the O
drawing O

room O
, O
the O
ladies O
were O
not O
there O
. O
| 
  | O
This O
rather O
disturbed O
Mr. O
Millbank B-PERSON
again O
  O
he O
had O
not O
seen O
enough O
of O
his O
daughter O
  O
he O
wished O
|
       | O
to O
hear O
her O
sing O
. O
But O
Edith B-PERSON
managed O
to O
reappear O
  O
and O
even O
to O
sing O
. O
Then O
Coningsby B-PERSON
went O
up O
to O
|
       | O
her O
and O
asked O
her O
to O
sing O
the O
song O
of O
the B-ORG
Girls I-ORG
of I-ORG
Granada I-ORG
. O
She O
said O
in O
a O
low O
voice O
, O
and O
with O
|
       | O
a O
fond O
yet O
serious O
look O
, O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
am O
not O
in O
the O
mood O

such O
a O

solemn O

Each O
of O
them O
was O
still O
in O
such O
a O
state O
of O
tremulous O
excitement O
, O
that O

       | O
neither O

time O
or O
occasion O
to O
ponder O
over O
the O

They O
both O
required O

solitude O

both O
longed O
to O
be O

Coningsby B-PERSON

pressed O
the O
soft O

said O
Oswald B-PERSON

very O
loud O
, O
knowing O
that O

       | O
the O

The B-TIME
morning I-TIME
broke O
lowering O
and O
thunderous O
  O
small O
white O
clouds O
, O
dull O
and O
immovable O
, O

       | O
studded O
the O
leaden O
sky O
  O
the O
waters O
of O
the O
rushing O
Darl B-PERSON
seemed O
to O
have O
become O
black O
and O
almost O
|
       | O
stagnant O
  O
the O
terraces O
of O
Hellingsley B-ORG
looked O
like O
the O
hard O
lines O
of O
a O
model O
  O
and O
the O
mansion O
|
       | O
itself O
had O
a O
harsh O
and O
metallic O
character O
. O
Before O
the O
chief O
portal O
of O
his O
Hall B-FAC
, O
the O
elder O
|
       | O
Millbank O
, O
with O
an O
air O
of O
some O
anxiety O
, O
surveyed O
the O
landscape O
and O
the O
heavens O
, O
as O
if O
he O
were O
|
       | O
speculating O
on O
the O
destiny O
of O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
. O
| 
   | O
raised O
walk O
before O
him O
. O
The O
clock O
of O
Hellingsley B-NORP
church O
had O
given O
the O
chimes O
of O
|
       | O
noon O
. O
His O
son O
and O
Coningsby B-PERSON
appeared O
at O
the O
end O
of O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
avenues O
. O
His O
eye O
lightened O
  O
his O
|
       | O
lip O
became O
compressed O
  O
he O
advanced O
to O
meet O
them O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Are O
you O
going O
to O
fish O
to O
- O
day O
, O
Oswald B-PERSON
? O
" O
he O
inquired O
of O
his O
son O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
We O
had O
some O
thoughts O
of O
it O
, O
sir O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
A O
fine O
day O
for O
sport O
, O
I O
should O
think O
, O
" O
he O
observed O
as O
he O
turned O
towards O
the O
Hall O
with O
|
       | O
them O
. O
| 
  | O
Coningsby B-PERSON
remarked O
the O
fanciful O
beauty O
of O
the O
portal O
  O
its O
twisted O
columns O
, O
and O
Caryatides O
|
       | O
carved O
in O
dark O
oak O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Yes O
, O
it O
's O
very O
well O
, O
" O
said O
Millbank B-ORG
, O
" O
but O
I O
really O
do O
not O
know O
why O
I O
came O
here O
  O
my O
|
       | O
presence O
is O
an O
effort O
. O
Oswald B-PERSON
does O
not O
care O
for O
the O
place O
  O
none O
of O
us O
do O
, O
I O
believe O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Oh O
! O
I O
like O
it O
now O

  O
and O
Edith B-PERSON
dotes O
on O
it O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
She O
was O
very O
happy O
at O
Millbank B-ORG
, O
" O
said O
the O
father O
rather O
sharply O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
We O
are O
all O
of O
us O
happy O
at O
Millbank B-ORG
, O
" O
said O
Oswald B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
was O
much O
struck O
with O
the O
valley O
and O
the O
whole O
settlement O
when O
I O
first B-ORDINAL
saw O
it O
, O
" O
said O
|
       | O
Coningsby O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Suppose O
you O
go O
and O
see O
about O
the O
tackle O

Oswald B-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Millbank B-PERSON
, O
" O
and O
Mr. O
Coningsby B-PERSON

       | O
and O
I O
will O
take O
a O
stroll O
on O
the O
terrace O
in O
the O
meantime O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
The O
habit O
of O
obedience O
which O
was O
supreme O
in O
this O
family O
instantly O
carried O
Oswald B-PERSON
away O
, O
|
       | O
though O
he O
was O
rather O
puzzled O
why O
his O
father O
should O
be O
so O
particularly O
anxious O
about O
the O
|
       | O
preparation O
of O
the O
fishing O
tackle O
, O
as O
he O
very O
rarely O
used O
it O
. O
His O
son O
had O
no O
sooner O
departed O
|
       | O
than O
Mr. O
Millbank B-PERSON
turned O
to O
Coningsby B-PERSON
and O
said O
very O
abruptly O
. O
| 
   | O
pointing O
to O
a O
chair O
, O
he O
begged O
his O
guest O
to O
be O
seated O
. O
Both O
in O
their O
chairs O
, O
|
       | O
Mr. O
Millbank B-PERSON
clearing O
his O
throat O
, O
said O
without O
preface O
, O
" O
I O
have O
reason O
to O
believe O
, O
Mr. O
|
       | O
Coningsby B-PERSON
, O
that O
you O
are O
attached O
to O
my O
daughter O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
have O
been O
attached O
to O
her O
for O
a O
long O
time O
  O
most O
ardently O
, O
" O
replied O
Coningsby B-PERSON
in O
a O
calm O
|
       | O
and O
rather O
measured O
tone O
, O
but O
looking O
very O
pale O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
And O
I O
have O
reason O
to O
believe O
that O
she O
returns O
your O
attachment O
, O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Millbank B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
believe O
she O
deigns O
— O
not O
to O
disregard O
it O
, O
" O
said O
Coningsby B-PERSON
, O
his O
white O
cheek O
becoming O
|
       | O
scarlet O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
It O
is O
then O
a O
mutual O
attachment O
, O
which O
if O
cherished O
, O
must O
produce O
mutual O
unhappiness O
, O
" O
said O
|
       | O
Mr. O
Millbank B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
would O
fain O
believe O
the O
reverse O
, O
" O
said O
Coningsby B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Why O
? O
" O
inquired O
Mr. O
Millbank B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Because O
I O
believe O
she O
possesses O
every O
charm O
, O
quality O
and O
virtue O
, O
that O
can O
bless O
man O
  O
and O
|
       | O
because O
, O
though O
I O
can O
make O
her O
no O
equivalent O
return O
, O
I O
have O
a O
heart O
, O
if O
I O
know O
myself O
, O
that O
|
       | O
would O
struggle O
to O
deserve O
her O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
know O
you O
to O
be O
a O
man O
of O
sense O
  O
I O
believe O
you O
to O
be O
a O
man O
of O
honour O
, O
" O
replied O
Mr. O
|
       | O
Millbank O
. O
" O
As O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
you O
must O
feel O
that O
an O
union O
between O
you O
and O
my O
daughter O
is O
|
       | O
impossible O
  O
what O
then O
should O
be O
your O
duty O
as O
a O
man O
of O
correct O
principle O
is O
obvious O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
could O
conceive O
that O
our O
union O
might O
be O
attended O
with O
difficulties O
, O
" O
said O
Coningsby B-PERSON
in O
a O
|
       | O
somewhat O
deprecating O
tone O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Sir O
, O
it O
is O
impossible O
, O
" O
repeated O
Mr. O
Millbank B-PERSON
interrupting O
him O
though O
not O
with O
harshness O
, O
|
       | O
" O
that O
is O
to O
say O
there O
is O
no O
conceivable O
marriage O
which O
could O
be O
effected O
at O
greater O
|
       | O
sacrifices O
, O
and O
which O
would O
occasion O
greater O
misery O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
The O
sacrifices O
are O
more O
apparent O
to O
me O
than O
the O
misery O
, O
" O
said O
Coningsby B-PERSON
, O
" O
and O
even O
they O
|
       | O
may O
be O
imaginary O
. O
" O
| 
   | O
others O
. O
But O
for O
these O
very O
reasons O
his O
hate O
is O
more O
intense O
. O
I O
can O
afford O
to O
|
       | O
hate O
him O
less O
than O
he O
hates O
me O
— O
I O
have O
injured O
him O
more O
. O
Here O
are O
feelings O
to O
exist O
between O
|
       | O
human O
beings O
! O
But O
they O
do O
exist O
— O
and O
now O
you O
are O
to O
go O
to O
this O
man O
, O
and O
ask O
his O
sanction O
to O
|
       | O
marry O
my O
daughter O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
But O
I O
would O
appease O
these O
hatreds O
  O
I O
would O
allay O
these O
dark O
passions O
, O
the O
origin O
of O
which O
|
       | O
I O
know O
not O
, O
but O
which O
never O
could O
justify O
the O
end O
, O
and O
which O
lead O
to O
so O
much O
misery O
. O
I O
would O
|
       | O
appeal O
to O
my O
grandfather O
— O
I O
would O
show O
him O

because O

a O
beam O

the O
fancy O

jumping O
up O
from O

he O
seemed O

to O
exult O
in O
his O
renovated O
energies O

then O
this O
sanguine O
paroxysm O
was O
succeeded O
by O
a O
fit O
of O

       | O
depression O
so O
dark O

dejected O

that O
nothing O

the O

necessity O

his O

       | O
departure O

a O
flash O
of O
lightning O
seemed O
to O
transfix O
the O

A O
clap O

the O

so O
menacing O

broke O
over O

its O

never O

But O
there O
was O
no O
joy O

in O

Mr. O

felt O
it O

indeed O
had O
been O
his O
absence O

  O
unquestionably O
his O
presence O
might O

       | O
have O
prevented O
the O
catastrophe O

Oswald B-PERSON
should O
have O
hindered O
all O
this O
. O
And O
yet O
Mr. O
Millbank B-PERSON
|
       | O
could O
not O
shut O
his O
eyes O
to O
the O
devotion O
of O
his O
son O
to O
Coningsby B-PERSON

He O
felt O
he O
could O
count O
on O
no O

       | O
assistance O
in O
this O
respect O
from O
that B-DATE
quarter I-DATE

Yet O
how O
hard O
upon O
him O
that O
he O
should O
seem O
to O

       | O
figure O
as O
a O
despot O
or O
a O
tyrant O
to O
his O
own O
children O
whom O
he O
loved O

when O
he O
had O
absolutely O

       | O
acted O
in O
an O
inevitable O
manner O
. O
Edith B-PERSON
seemed O
sad O
, O
Oswald B-PERSON
sullen I-PERSON
, O
all O
was O
changed O

All O
the O

       | O
life O

seemed O
to O
be O
frustrated O

And O
why O
? O
Because O
a O
young O
man O
had O
made O
love O
to O
his O
daughter O
, O

       | O
who O
was O
really O
in O
no O

written O
before O

perhaps O
he O
might O
have O
recognised O
a O
more O
satisfactory O
reason O

       | O
for O
the O
transient O
liveliness O
of O
his O

       | O
scarcely O
doubt O
that O

which O
her O
casual O
inquiries O
of O
Lord O

       | O
induced O
her O
to O
believe O

the O
case O

that O

there O
was O
a O
fascinating O

anxiety O

Edith B-PERSON

It O

Lady B-PERSON
Monmouth I-PERSON
, O
as O
was O
her O
custom O
to O
read O

Flora B-PERSON
seated O

her O

read O
for O
about B-DATE
a I-DATE
quarter I-DATE
of I-DATE
an I-DATE
hour I-DATE
. O
Reading O
was O
an O
accomplishment O
|
       | O
which O
distinguished O
Flora B-PERSON
  O
but O
today B-DATE
her O
voice O
faultered O
, O
her O
expression O
was O
uncertain O
  O
she O

       | O
seemed O
but O
very O
imperfectly O
to O
comprehend O
her O
page O
. O
More O
than O
once O
Lady O
Monmouth B-PERSON
looked O
round O

       | O
at O
her O
with O
an O
inquisitive O
glance O
. O
Suddenly O
Flora B-PERSON
stopped O
and O
burst O
into O
tears O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Oh O
! O
madam O

" O
she O
at O

exclaimed O
, O
" O
if O
you O
would O
but O
speak O
to O
Mr. O
Coningsby B-PERSON
all O
might O

right O

" O

  | O
" O
What O
is O
this O

" O
said O
Lady B-PERSON
Monmouth I-PERSON
, O
turning O
quickly O
on O
the O
sofa O
, O
then O
collecting O
herself O
in O
|
       | O
an O
instant O
she O
continued O
with O
less O
abruptness O
and O
with O
more O
suavity O
than O
usual O
, O
" O

me O
, O

       | O

" O
| 
  | O
An O
expression O
of O
eager O
interest O
came O
over O
the O
countenance O
of O
Lucretia B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Why O

" O
I O

a O

my O

very O

       | O
angry O

" O

" O

up O

nothing O

between O

The O

skilful O

Lucretia B-PERSON
, O
in O
a O

       | O
state O

considerable O
irritation O

about O

  | O
Lady O

a O
somewhat O
grave O

perplexed O

decided O
upon O
a O
course O

       | O
as O
well O
as O
me O
that O
he O
never O

left O
peremptory O

he O

that O
he O

suggests O
that O

       | O
everything O
in O
short O
should O
be O
arranged O

some O
degree O

of O

had O
for O
some O
time O

fitting O
up O

Rigby B-PERSON

, O
as O
Coningsby B-PERSON
also O
learnt O

now O
permanently O
resided O
at O
Monmouth B-ORG
House I-ORG
. O
All O
this O
|
       | O
intelligence O
made O
Coningsby B-PERSON
ponder O
. O
He O
was O
sufficiently O
acquainted O
with O
the O
parties O
concerned O
|
       | O
to O
feel O
assured O
that O
he O
had O
not O
learnt O
the O
whole O
truth O
. O
What O
had O
really O
taken O
place O
, O
and O
what O
|
       | O
was O
the O
real O
cause O
of O
the O
occurrences O
, O
were O
equally O
mystical O
to O
him O
: O
all O
he O
was O
convinced O
of O
|
       | O
was O
, O
that O
some O
great O
domestic O
revolution O
had O
been O
suddenly O
effected O
. O

   | O
facility O
, O
is O
bewitching O
. O
Lord O
Monmouth B-PERSON
was O
never O
garrulous O
: O
he O
was O
always O
pithy O
|
       | O
and O
could O
be O
picturesque O
. O
He O
revealed O
a O
character O
in O
a O
sentence O
  O
and O
detected O
the O
ruling O
|
       | O
passion O
with O
the O
hand O
of O
a O
master O
. O
Besides O
he O
had O
seen O
everybody O
and O
had O
done O
everything O
  O
and O
|
       | O
though O
on O
the O
whole O
too O
indolent O
for O
conversation O
, O
and O
loving O
to O
be O
talked O
to O
, O
these O
were O
|
       | O
circumstances O
which O
made O
his O
too O
rare O
communications O
the O
more O
precious O
. O

the O
devil O
Care O
and O
all O
his O
works O
. O
And O
well O
it O
was O
, O
that O
he O
found O
such O
agreeable O

       | O
companions O
, O
for O
time O
flowed O
on O
, O
and O
no O
summons O
arrived O
to O
call O
him O
to O
his O
grandfather O

presence O

announce O
his O
grandfather O

The O
ladies O
and O
Coningsby B-PERSON
had O

       | O
exhausted O
badinage O
  O
they O
had O
examined O
and O
criticised O
all O
the O
furniture O
  O
had O
rifled O
the O
vases O

       | O
of O
their O
prettiest O
flowers O
  O
and O
Clotilde B-PERSON
who O
had O
already O
sung O
several O
times O
, O
was O
proposing O
a O
|
       | O
duet O
to O
Ermengarde B-PERSON
, O
when O
a O
servant O
entered O
, O
and O
told O
the O
ladies O
that O
a O
carriage O
was O
in O
|
       | O
attendance O
to O
give O
them O
an O
airing O
, O
and O
after O
that O
Lord O
Monmouth B-PERSON
hoped O
they O
would O
return O
and O
|
       | O
dine O
with O
him O
  O
then O
turning O
to O
Coningsby B-PERSON
he O
informed O
him O
with O
his O
Lord O
's O
compliments O
, O
that O
|
       | O
Lord O
Monmouth B-PERSON
was O
sorry O

was O
too O
much O
engaged O
to O
see O
him O
. O
| 
  | O
Nothing O
was O
to O
be O
done O
but O
to O
put O
a O
tolerably O
good O
face O
upon O
it O
. O
" O
Embrace O

Monmouth B-PERSON

said O
Coningsby B-PERSON
to O
his O
fair O
friends O
, O
" O
and O
tell O
him O

think O
it O
very O
unkind O

ask O
me O

anything O

person O
that O

had O
still O

some O
degree O
the O
misfortune O
of O
being O
a O
responsible O
member O
of O
society O

He O
wanted O
to O
be O

       | O
surrounded O
by O
individuals O
who O
were O
above O
or O
below O
the O
conventional O
interests O
of O
what O
is O

       | O
called O
" O
the B-WORK_OF_ART

He O
wanted O
to O
hear O
nothing O
of O
those O
painful O

embarrassing O
influences O

       | O
which O
from O
our O
contracted O

magnify O
into O
such O
undue O

       | O
importance O

For O
this O
purpose O
he O
wished O

about O
him O
persons O
whose O
knowledge O
of O
the O
cares O

       | O
of O

       | O
greatly O

The O
message O
which O
was O
duly O
given O
however O
|
       | O
settled O
the O
business O
. O
Lord O
Monmouth B-PERSON
felt O
that O
any O
chance O
of O
explanations O
or O
even O
allusions O
to O
|
       | O
the O
past O
was O
out O
of O
the O
question O
  O
and O
to O
defend O
himself O
from O
the O
accusations O
of O
his O
animated O
|
       | O
guests O
, O
he O
said O
, O
| 
  | O
" O
Well O
, O
he O
shall O
come O

dine O

you O

" O

  | O
There O
is O
no O
end O
to O
the O
influence O
of O
woman O
on O
our O
life O
. O
It O
is O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
everything O
|
       | O
that O
happens O
to O
us O
. O
And O
so O
it O
was O
, O
that O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
all O
the O
combinations O
of O
Lucretia B-PERSON
and O
Mr. O

       | O
Rigby B-PERSON
, O
and O
the O
mortification O
and O
resentment O
of O
Lord O
Monmouth B-PERSON
, O
the O
favourable O
impression O
he O

       | O
casually O
made O
on O
a O
couple O
of O
French B-NORP
actresses O
occasioned O
Coningsby B-PERSON
, O
before O
a B-DATE
month I-DATE

       | O
elapsed O
since O
his O
memorable O
interview O
at O
Monmouth B-ORG
House I-ORG
, O
to O
receive O
an O
invitation O
again O
to O

dine O
with O
his O
grandfather O
. O
| 
   | O
Rigby B-PERSON
. O
Our O
hero O
remarked O
that O
Villebecque B-ORG
on O
this O
occasion O
sat O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
|
       | O
the O
table O
, O
but O
Flora B-PERSON
did O
not O
appear O
. O
| 
   | O
there O
were O
relations O
of O
intimacy O
scarcely O
less O
inseparable O
. O
Coningsby B-PERSON
had O
|
       | O
spoken O
to O
Lady B-PERSON
Everingham I-PERSON
of O
the O
rumoured O
marriage O
of O
her O
elder O
brother O
, O
and O
found O
, O
although O
|
       | O
the O
family O
had O
not O
yet O
been O
formally O
apprised O
of O
it O
, O
she O
entertained O
very O
little O
doubt O
of O
its O
|
       | O
ultimate O
occurrence O
. O
She O
admired O
Miss O
Millbank B-PERSON
with O
whom O
her O
acquaintance O
continued O
slight O
  O
|
       | O
and O
she O
wished O
of O
course O
that O
her O
brother O
should O
marry O
and O
be O
happy O
, O
" O
but O
Percy B-PERSON
is O
often O
in O

       | O
love O
, O
" O
she O
would O
add O
, O
" O
and O
never O
likes O
us O
to O
be O
very O
intimate O
with O
his O
inamoratas O

He O
thinks O
|
       | O
it O
destroys O
the O
romance O
  O
and O
that O
domestic O
familiarity O
may O
compromise O
his O
heroic O
character O
. O

       | O
However O
, O
" O
she O
added O

" O

rooms O
in O
the O
Albany B-GPE

he O
felt O
all O
his O
desolation O
  O
and O
often O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
before O

       | O
he O
figured O
in O
the O
world O
apparently O
followed O
and O
courted O
by O
all O
, O
he O
had O
been O
plunged O
in O
the O
|
       | O
darkest O
fits O
of O
irremediable O
wetchedness O
. O
| 
  | O
He O
had O
of O
course O
frequently O
met O
Lady B-PERSON
Wallinger I-PERSON
, O
but O
their O
salutations O
though O
never O
omitted O

       | O
and O
on O
each O
side O
cordial O
, O
were O
brief O
. O
There O
seemed O
to O
be O
a O
tacit O
understanding O
between O
them O

       | O
not O
to O
refer O
to O
a O
subject O
fruitful O
in O
painful O
reminiscences O
. O

  | O
The O
season O
waned O
  O
in O
the O
fulfilment O
of O
a O
project O
originally O
formed O
in O
the O
Playing O
fields O
of O

Eton O

often O
recurred O
to O
at O
Cambridge B-GPE

cherished O
with O
the O
fondness O

which O
men O
cling O

Coningsby B-PERSON

Henry B-GPE
Sydney I-GPE

Vere B-PERSON

had O
engaged O
some O

together O
this B-DATE

in O
a B-DATE

were O
about O

They O
had O

       | O
pressed O
Eustace B-PERSON

to O
accompany O
them O
, O
but O
he O
who O
in O
general O
seemed O
to O
have O
no O
pleasure O

       | O
greater O
than O
their O
society O
had O
surprised O
them O
by O
declining O
their O
invitation O
, O
with O
some O
vague O

       | O
mention O
that O
he O
rather O
thought O
he O
should O
go O
abroad O

It O
was O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
day I-DATE
of I-DATE
July I-DATE
, O
and O
all O
the O
world O
were O
at O
a O
breakfast O
given O
, O
at O
a O
fanciful O

       | O
cottage O
, O
situate O
in O
beautiful O
gardens O
on O
the O
banks O
of O
the O
Thames B-GPE
, O
by O
Lady B-PERSON
Everingham I-PERSON
. O
The O
|
       | O
weather O
was O
as O
bright O
as O
the O
romances O
of O
Boccacio B-ORG
  O
there O
were O
pyramids O
of O
strawberries O
in O
|
       | O
bowls O
colossal O
enough O
to O
hold O
orange O
trees O
  O
and O
the O
choicest O
bands O
filled O
the O
air O
with O
|
       | O
enchanting O
strains O
, O
while O
a O
brilliant O
multitude O
sauntered O
on O
turf O
like O
velvet O
, O
or O
roamed O
in O
|
       | O
desultory O
existence O
amid O
the O
quivering O
shades O
of O
winding O
walks O

  | O
" O
My O
fête O
was O
prophetic O

said O
Lady B-PERSON

when O
she O
saw O

glad O

" O

" O
You O

more O
prescient O
than O
me O

" O
said O
Lady B-PERSON
Everingham I-PERSON
, O
" O
perhaps O
because O
I O
was O

added O

The O
first B-ORDINAL
feeling O

       | O
which O
he O
experienced O
at O
the O
intelligence O

He O
was O
fond O

received O
great O
kindness O
from O
him O

at O
a O
period O
of O
life O
when O
it O
was O
most O

       | O
welcome O
. O
The O
neglect O
and O
hardships O
of O
his O
early O
years O

more O
keenly O
sensible O
of O
the O
solicitude O

       | O
continued O
at O

indefinite O
feeling O

, O
in O
spite O
of O
many O
a O
rational O
effort O
, O
did O

       | O

haunt O

Coningsby B-PERSON
could O
not O

feel O
some O
consolation O

in O
the O
affliction O

he O
sincerely O
experienced O

an O

it O
for O
a O

to O
be O
supposed O
that O
he O
was O

       | O
envious O
of O
her O
lot O

He O
replied O

therefore O
, O
that O
in O
an B-TIME

he O
would O
wait O
upon O
her O

first B-ORDINAL
meeting O
was O
held O

       | O
under O
circumstances O
most O
strangely O
different O

Then O
Coningsby B-PERSON
was O
the O
patron O

a O
generous O

       | O
spontaneous O
one O
, O
of O
a O
being O
obscure O
, O
almost O
friendless O
, O
and O
sinking O
under O
bitter O

       | O
mortification O
. O
His O
favour O
could O
not O
be O
the O
less O
appreciated O
because O
he O
was O
the O
chosen O

       | O
relative O
of O
a O
powerful O
noble O
. O
That O
noble O
was O
no O
more O

suffering O

Coningsby B-PERSON

then O
soothed O

whose O
fortune O
had O
risen O
on O
the O
destruction O

Flora B-PERSON

The O
extreme O
delicacy O

her O

       | O
appearance O
was O
increased O
by O
her O
deep O

seated O

a O
cushioned O

from O

       | O
she O
seemed O
to O
rise O
with O
an O
effort O

she O
certainly O
presented O
little O

" O

faintly O

For O
these O

The O

The O
third B-ORDINAL
edition O
of O
the O
Sun B-ORG
left O
Mr. O
Rigby B-PERSON
in O
vain O
|
       | O
attempting O
to O
address O
an O
infuriated O
populace O
. O
| 
   | O
when O
they O
were O
to O
repair O
together O
immediately O
to O
Darlford B-ORG
in O
time O
for O
Coningsby B-PERSON

       | O

be O

, O
for O
no O
one O
entertained O
a O
doubt O
of O
his O
triumph O
. O
| 
  | O
Coningsby O
did O
not O
sleep O
a O
wink O
that O
night O
, O
and O
yet O
when O
he O
rose O
early O
felt O
fresh O
enough O
for O
|
       | O
any O
exploit O
however O
difficult O
or O
hazardous O
. O
He O
felt O
as O
an O
Egyptian B-NORP
does O
when O
the O
Nile B-LOC
rises O
|
       | O
after O
its O
elevation O
had O
been O
despaired O
of O
. O
At O
the O
very O
lowest O
ebb O
of O
his O
fortunes O
, O
an O
event O
|
       | O
had O
occurred O
which O
seemed O
to O
restore O
all O
. O
He O
dared O
not O
contemplate O
the O
ultimate O
result O
of O
all O
|
       | O
these O
wonderful O
changes O
. O
Enough O
for O
him O
that O
when O
all O
seemed O
dark O
, O
he O
was O
about O
to O
be O

here O
were O

from O

at O
length O
evolved O
  O

all O

subsided O

       | O
in O
an O
overwhelming O
feeling O
of O
gratitude O
to O
that O

so O
signally O
protected O

   | O
Oswald B-PERSON
was O
as O
excited O
as O
Coningsby B-PERSON
. O
His O
eye O
sparkled O
, O
his O

determined O
that O

the O

he O
acknowledged O
in O

but O
Sir O

spoke O

       | O
feebly O

The O

who O
making O
no O

listened O
with O

       | O
interest O
, O
inveighed O
against O
Lord O

and O
condemned O
his O
will O
. O
| 
   | O
the O
silent O
sadness O
of O
Edith B-PERSON
, O
his O
own O
conviction O
which O
assured O
him O
that O

       | O
do O
nothing O
wiser O
or O
better O
than O
take O
this O
young O
man O
to O
his O
heart O
, O
so O
ordained O
it O
that O
Mr. O

       | O
Millbank O
who O
was O
after O
all O
the O
creature O
of O

decided O
rightly O

Never O

Mr. O

all O
that O

| 
  | O
This O
is O
a O
very O
imperfect O

crude O
intimation O
of O
what O
had O
occurred O
at O
Millbank B-ORG
and O
|
       | O
Hellingsley B-ORG
  O
yet O
it O
conveys O
a O
faint O
sketch O
of O
the O
enchanting O
intelligence O
that O
Oswald B-PERSON

       | I-PERSON
conveyed O
to O
Coningsby B-PERSON
during O
their O
rapid O
travel O

When O
they O
arrived O
at O

found O

that O
Mr. O

resigned O

He O
was O
however O
|
       | O
requested O
to O
remain O
at O
Birmingham B-GPE
, O
as O
they O
did O
not O

him O
to O
enter O
Darlford B-ORG
except O
to O
be O

       | O
chaired O

so O
he O
was O
to O
arrive O
there O
in O
the O
morning O

At O

therefore O
they O
remained O

time O
for O
this O

Now O
they O
were O
both O

but O
those O
were O
words O
and O

       | O
dreams O
  O
these O
were O
positive O
facts O
  O
after O
some O

the O

       | O
their O
representative O
and O
for O
the O
spirit O
in O
which O
they O
had O
greeted O
him O
  O
but O
he O
had O
to O
offer O
|
       | O
them O
no O
niggard O
exposition O
of O
the O
views O
and O
opinions O
of O
the O
member O
whom O
they O
had O
so O
|
       | O
confidingly O
chosen O
without O
even O
a O
formal O
declaration O
of O
his O
sentiments O
. O
| 
  | O
He O
did O
this O
with O
so O
much O
clearness O
, O
and O
in O
a O
manner O
so O
pointed O
and O
popular O
, O
that O
the O
deep O
|
       | O
attention O
of O
the O
multitude O
never O
wavered O
. O
His O
lively O
illustrations O
kept O
them O
often O
in O
|
       | O
continued O
merriment O
. O
But O
when O
towards O
his O
close O
he O
drew O
some O
picture O
of O
what O
he O
hoped O
might O
|
       | O
be O
the O
character O
of O
his O
future O
and O
lasting O
connexion O
with O
the O
town O
, O
the O
vast O
throng O
was O
|
       | O
singularly O
affected O
. O
There O
were O
a O
great O
many O
present O
at O
that O
moment O
who O
though O
they O
had O
never O
|
       | O
seen O
Coningsby B-PERSON
before O
, O
would O
willingly O
have O
then O
died O
for O
him O
. O
Coningsby B-PERSON
had O
touched O
their O
|
       | O
hearts O
, O
for O

had O
spoken O
from O
his O
own O
. O
His O
spirit O
had O
entirely O
magnetized O
them O
. O

a O
very O
good O
creed O
. O
| 
   | O

slow O
, O
as O

one O
wished O
to O
shake O
hands O
with O
him O
. O
His O
|
       | O
friends O
, O
however O
, O
at O
last O
safely O
landed O
him O

sprang O
up O

their O
joy O
