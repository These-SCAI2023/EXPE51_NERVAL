The O
Sixteenth O
Century O
drew O
to O
a O
close O

It O
was O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
day I-DATE
of I-DATE
the I-DATE
last I-DATE

, O
and O
two B-TIME

     | O
only O
were O
wanting O
to O
the O
birth O
of O
another B-DATE
year I-DATE
and O
of O
another B-DATE
century I-DATE
. O

The O
night O
was O
solemn O
and O
beautiful O
. O
Myriads O
of O
stars O
paved O
the O
deep O
vault O
of O
heaven O
  O
the O

     | O
crescent O

hung I-PERSON
like O
a O
silver O
lamp O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
them O
  O
a O
stream O
of O
rosy O

quivering O

     | O
light O
, O
issuing O
from O
the O
north O
, O
traversed O
the O
sky O
, O
like O
the O
tail O
of O
some O
stupendous O
comet O
  O
while O

     | O
from O
its O
point O
of O
effluence O
broke O
forth O

ever O

coruscations O
rivalling O

  | O
A O
sharp O
frost O
prevailed O
  O
but O
the O
atmosphere O
was O
clear O
and O
dry O
, O
and O
neither O
wind O
nor O
snow O
|
     | O
aggravated O
the O
wholesome O
rigour O
of O
the B-DATE
season I-DATE
. O
The O
water O
lay O
in O
thick O
congealed O
masses O
around O

     | O
the O
conduits O

wells O
, O
and O
the O
buckets O
were O
frozen O
on O
their O
stands O

The O
thoroughfares O
were O

     | O
sheeted O
with O
ice O
, O
and O
dangerous O
to O
horsemen O
and O
vehicles O
  O
but O
the O
footways O
were O
firm O
and O

     | O
pleasant O
to O
the O
tread O
. O
| 
  | O
Here O
and O
there O
, O
a O
fire O
was O
lighted O
in O
the O
streets O

round O
which O
ragged O
urchins O

Crowds O
were O
collected O
in O
the O
open O
places O

watching O
the O

wonders O

the O
advent O

a O

The O

the O

his O
still O

His O
forehead O

     | O
was O
high O

ploughed O
by O
innumerable O

His O
countenance O

despite O
its O

this O

     | O
venerable O
personage O
was O
esteemed O
by O
the O
vulgar O
as O
little O
better O
than O
a O
wizard O

Strange O
tales O

Doctor O

gaze O
was O
fixed O
intently O
upon O
the O

he O
seamed O
to O

turned O

To O
his O
surprise O

the O
doctor O
perceived O

     | O
that O
two B-CARDINAL

these O

had O
just O
been O
overthrown O
by O
a O

who O
was O
in O
the O
act O
of O
stripping O

     | O
them O
of O
their O
grisly O
burdens O
. O
| 
  | O
Having O
accomplished O
his O
object O
, O
the O
mysterious O
plunderer O
thrust O
his O
spoil O
into O
a O
leathern O
bag O
|
     | O
with O
which O
he O
was O
provided O
, O
tied O
its O
mouth O
, O
and O
was O
about O
to O
take O
his O
departure O
by O
means O
of O
a O

     | O
rope O

ladder O
attached O
to O
the O
battlements O
, O
when O
his O
retreat O
was O
suddenly O
cut O
off O
by O
the O

     | O
gatekeeper O
, O
armed O
with O
a O
halberd O

bearing O
a O

who O
issued O
from O
a O
door O
opening O
upon O

     | O
the O
leads O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
baffled O
marauder O
looked O
round O
, O
and O
remarking O
the O
open O
window O
at O
which O
Doctor O
Lamb B-PERSON
was O

     | O
stationed O
, O
hurled O
the O
sack O

its O
contents O
through O
it O

He O
then O
tried O
to O
gain O
the O
ladder O
, O
but O
|
     | O
was O
intercepted O
by O
the O
gatekeeper O
, O
who O
dealt O
him O
a O
severe O
blow O
on O
the O
head O
with O
his O
halberd O
. O
|
     | O
The O
plunderer O
uttered O
a O
loud O
cry O
, O
and O
attempted O
to O
draw O
his O
sword O
  O
but O
before O
he O
could O
do O
so O
, O
|
     | O
he O
received O
a O
thrust O
in O
the O
side O
from O
his O
opponent O
. O
He O
then O
fell O
, O
and O
the O
gatekeeper O
would O
have O
|
     | O
repeated O
the O
blow O
, O
if O
the O
doctor O
had O
not O
called O
to O
him O
to O
desist O

“ O
Do O
not O

him O

” O
he O
cried O
. O
“ O
The O

Doubtless O

the O
mutilated O

which O
the O
poor O

attempted O
to O
carry O
off O

those O

     | O
his O

“ O

Baldred B-PERSON

so O
I O

“ O

“ O

“ O

replied O
Doctor O
Lamb B-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
voice O
of O
emotion O
that O
startled O
his O
hearer O
. O

     | O
“ O
They O
were O
near O

  | O
“ O
Of O
a O
verity O

a O
fair O
youth O

” O
replied O
Baldred B-PERSON
, O
holding O
down O
the O
lantern O
. O
“ O
Heaven O
grant O
I O
have O

heart O
still O
beats O

Ha O
! O
here O
are O
his O
tablets O

” O
he O
added O
, O

     | O
taking O
a O
small O
book O
from O
his O
doublet O

“ O
these O

in O
your O

The O

the O

” O

  | O
“ O

all O

cried O
Lamb B-PERSON

“ O

  | O
As O
the O
gatekeeper O
essayed O
to O
comply O
, O
the O
wounded O
man O
groaned O
deeply O
, O
as O
if O

great O
pain O

“ O
Fling O

Doctor O

in O
accents O

     | O
commiseration O
, O
“ O

  | O
“ O
I O

” O
cried O
Baldred B-PERSON
, O
throwing O
the O
halberd O
into O
the O

     | O
balcony O
. O
“ O
I O
will O
do O
my O
part O
as O
gently O
as O
I O
can O
. O
” O
| 
  | O
And O
as O
the O
alchemist O
took O
up O
the O
weapon O
, O
and O
disappeared O
through O
the O
window O
, O
the O
gatekeeper O
|
     | O
lifted O
the O
wounded O
man O
by O
the O
shoulders O
, O
and O
conveyed O
him O
down O
a O
narrow O
, O
winding O
staircase O
to O
a O
|
     | O
lower O
chamber O
. O
Though O
he O
proceeded O
carefully O
, O
the O
sufferer O
was O
put O
to O
excruciating O
pain O
  O
and O
|
     | O
when O
Baldred B-PERSON
placed O
him O
on O
a O
wooden O
bench O
, O
and O
held O
a O
lamp O
towards O
him O
, O
he O
perceived O
that O
his O
|
     | O
features O
were O
darkened O
and O
distorted O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
I O
fear O
it O
’s O
all O
over O
with O
him O
, O
” O
murmured O
the O
gatekeeper O
  O
“ O
I O
shall O
have O
a O
dead O
body O
to O
take O
|
     | O
to O
Doctor O
Lamb B-PERSON
. O
It O
would O
be O
a O
charity O
to O
knock O
him O
on O
the O
head O
, O
rather O
than O
let O
him O
suffer O
|
     | O
thus O
. O
The O
doctor O
passes O
for O
a O
cunning O
man O
, O
but O
if O
he O
can O
cure O
this O
poor O
youth O
without O
seeing O
|
     | O
him O
, O
by O
the O
help O
of O
his O
sympathetic O
ointment O
, O
I O
shall O
begin O
to O
believe O
, O
what O
some O
folks O
avouch O
, O
|
     | O
that O
he O
has O
relations O
with O
the O
devil O
. O
” O
| 
  | O
While O
Baldred O
was O
ruminating O
in O
this O
manner O
, O
a O
sudden O
and O
extraordinary O
change O
took O
place O
in O
|
     | O
the O
sufferer O
. O
As O
if O
by O
magic O
, O
the O
contraction O
of O
the O
muscles O
subsided O
  O
the O
features O
assumed O
a O
|
     | O
wholesome O
hue O
, O
and O
the O
respiration O
was O
no O
longer O
laborious O
. O
Baldred O
stared O
as O
if O
a O
miracle O
had O
|
     | O
been O
wrought O
. O
| 
  | O
Now O
that O
the O
countenance O
of O
the O
youth O
had O
regained O
its O
original O
expression O
, O
the O
gatekeeper O
|
     | O
could O
not O
help O
being O
struck O
by O
its O
extreme O
beauty O
. O
The O
face O
was O
a O
perfect O
oval O
, O
with O
regular O
|
     | O
and O
delicate O
features O
. O
A O
short O
silken O
moustache O
covered O
the O
upper O
lip O
, O
which O
was O
short O
and O
|
     | O
proud O
, O
and O
a O
pointed O
beard O
terminated O
the O
chin O
. O
The O
hair O
was O
black O
, O
glossy O
, O
and O
cut O
short O
, O
so O
|
     | O
as O
to O
disclose O
a O
highly O
intellectual O
expanse O
of O
brow O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
youth O
’s O
figure O
was O
slight O
, O
but O
admirably O
proportioned O
. O
His O
attire O
consisted O
of O
a O
black O
|
     | O
satin O
doublet O
, O
slashed O
with O
white O
, O
hose O
of O
black O
silk O
, O
and O
a O
short O
velvet O
mantle O
. O
His O
eyes O
were O
|
     | O
still O
closed O
, O
and O
it O
was O
difficult O
to O
say O
what O
effect O
they O
might O
give O
to O
the O
face O
when O
they O
|
     | O
lighted O
it O
up O
  O
but O
notwithstanding O
its O
beauty O
, O
it O
was O
impossible O
not O
to O
admit O
that O
a O
strange O
, O
|
     | O
sinister O
, O
and O
almost O
demoniacal O
expression O
pervaded O
the O
countenance O
. O
| 
  | O
All O
at O
once O
, O
and O
with O
as O
much O
suddenness O
as O
his O
cure O
had O
been O
effected O
, O
the O
young O
man O
|
     | O
started O
, O
uttering O
a O
piercing O
cry O
, O
and O
placed O
his O
hand O
to O
his O
side O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
Caitiff O
! O
” O
he O
cried O
, O
fixing O
his O
blazing O
eyes O
on O
the O
gatekeeper O
, O
“ O
why O
do O
you O
torture O
me O
thus O
? O
|
     | O
Finish O
me O
at O
once O
— O
Oh O
! O
” O
| 
  | O
And O
overcome O
by O
anguish O
, O
he O
sank O
back O
again O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
I O
have O
not O
touched O
you O
, O
sir O
, O
” O
replied O
Baldred B-PERSON
. O
“ O
I O
brought O
you O
here O
to O
succour O
you O
. O
You O
will O
|
     | O
be O
easier O
anon O
. O
Doctor O
Lamb B-PERSON
must O
have O
wiped O
the O
halberd O
, O
” O
he O
added O
to O
himself O
. O
| 
  | O
Another O
sudden O
change O
. O
The O
pain O
fled O
from O
the O
sufferer O
’s O
countenance O
, O
and O
he O
became O
easy O
as O
|
     | O
before O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
What O
have O
you O
done O
to O
me O
? O
” O
he O
asked O
, O
with O
a O
look O
of O
gratitude O
  O
“ O
the O
torture O
of O
my O
wound O
has O
|
     | O
suddenly O
ceased O
, O
and O
I O
feel O
as O
if O
a O
balm O
had O
been O
dropped O
into O
it O
. O
Let O
me O
remain O
in O
this O
state O

     | O
if O
you O
have O
any O
pity O
— O
or O
despatch O
me O
, O
for O
my O
late O
agony O
was O
almost O
insupportable O
. O
” O
| 
  | O
“ O
You O
are O
cared O
for O
by O
one O
who O
has O
greater O
skill O
than O
any O
chirurgeon O
in O
London B-GPE
, O
” O
replied O
|
     | O
Baldred O
. O
“ O
If O
I O
can O
manage O
to O
transport O
you O

lodgings O

speedily O

” O
| 
  | O
“ O
Do O
not O
delay O
, O
then O
, O
” O
replied O
Auriol B-PERSON
faintly O
  O
“ O
for O
though O
I O
am O
free O
from O
pain O
, O
I O
feel O
that O

     | O
life O

ebbing O
fast O
away O

” O

“ O

handkerchief O
to O
your O
side O

on O

Baldred B-PERSON
. O
“ O

is O

In O
another O
moment O
they O
were O
at O
the O
doctor O
’s O
door O

Baldred O
tapped O
against O
it O
, O
and O
the O
summons O

     | O
was O
instantly O
answered O
by O
a O
diminutive O
personage O
, O
clad O
in O
a O
jerkin O
of O
coarse O
grey O
serge O
, O
and O

     | O
having O
a O
leathern O

tied O
round O

begrimed O
, O
lantern O

jawed O
, O
the O
poor O
dwarf O
seemed O
as O
if O
his O
whole O
life O
had O

     | O
been O
spent O
over O
the O
furnace O

And O
so O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
it O
had O
been O
. O
He O
had O
become O
little O
better O
than O
a O

     | O
pair O
of O
human O
bellows O
. O
In O
his O
hand O
he O
held O
the O
halberd O
with O

Auriol B-PERSON

been O
wounded O

“ O

Baldred B-PERSON

“ O
Ay O

replied O
the O
dwarf O

with O
a O
wild O
grin O

displaying O
a O
wolfish O
set O
of O

     | O
teeth O

“ O
My O
master O
ordered O
me O
to O
smear O

I O
obeyed O
him O
: O

rubbed O
the O

the O

“ O

“ O
These O

cried O
the O
gatekeeper O
, O
glancing O
at O
the O
bag O
, O
which O
was O
lying O
on O
the O

and O
from O
which O
a O
bald O

protruded—“I O

” O

“ O

“ O

” O

  | O
Casting O
a O
furtive O
glance O
round O
the O
laboratory O
, O
and O
shrugging O
his O
shoulders O
, O
Baldred B-PERSON
departed O
  O

     | O

Flapdragon B-GPE
having O
bathed O
the O

in O
obedience O
to O
his O

next O

  | O
“ O
Begone O

” O
cried O
the O
doctor O
, O
so O
fiercely O
that O
the O
dwarf O
darted O
out O

clapping O
the O

Doctor O

then O
applied O
himself O
to O
his O
task O
with O
renewed O
ardour O
, O
and O
in O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
seconds I-TIME
became O

     | O
wholly O
insensible O
of O
the O

a O
stranger O

  | O
Revived O
by O
the O

, O
Auriol B-PERSON
presently O
opened O
his O
eyes O
, O
and O
gazing O
round O
the O
room O
, O

     | O
thought O
he O
must O
be O
dreaming O

so O
strange O

fantastical O
did O
all O
appear O

The O

In O
one B-CARDINAL

The O

Doctor O

steadily O
pursued O

As O

  | O
Tinged O
by O
these O

the O
different O

in O
the O

to O
take O
other O

to O
become O
instinct O

The O

transformed O

tried O

from O
his O

  O
the O

     | O
skeletons O
wagged O
their O

raised O

in O
mockery O

blue O
lights O

     | O
burnt O
in O
their O
eyeless O

  O
the O

the O

Auriol B-PERSON

brain O
reeled O

he O
pressed O
his O

to O
exclude O
these O
phantasms O
from O

But O
even O
thus O
they O
pursued O
him O

imagined O

could O
hear O
the O
infernal O
riot O

     | O
going O
on O
around O
him O

Suddenly O
, O
he O
was O
roused O
by O
a O
loud O
joyful O

, O
uncovering O
his O

he O

“ O

I O

“ O
Were O

deeds O

asked O
Auriol B-PERSON

“ O
One B-CARDINAL
was O

replied O
Darcy B-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
shudder O

“ O

Listen O

you O
shall O

how O
it O

A O
Roman B-NORP
rabbi O

     | O
named O
Ben B-PERSON
Lucca I-PERSON
, O
skilled O
in O
hermetic O
science O
, O
came O
to O
this O
city O
. O
His O
fame O
reached O
me O
, O
and O
I O
|
     | O
sought O
him O
out O
, O
offering O
myself O
as O
his O
disciple O
. O
For O
months B-DATE
, O
I O
remained O
with O
him O
in O
his O
|
     | O
laboratory O
— O
working O
at O
the O
furnace O
, O
and O
poring O
over O
mystic O
lore O
. O
One B-TIME
night I-TIME
he O
showed O
me O
that O
|
     | O
volume O
, O
and O
, O
pointing O
to O
a O
page O
within O
it O
, O
said O
: O
‘ O
Those O

the O

confecting O

I O
will O

will O
proceed O

     | O
to O
the O
operation O
. O
’ O
With O
this O
, O
he O
unfolded O
the O
mystery O
  O
but O
he O
bade O
me O
observe O
, O
that O
the O

     | O
menstruum O
was O
defective O
on O
one B-CARDINAL
point O

Wherefore O
, O
he O
said O

‘ O
there O

’ O
Oh O

with O
what O

I O
gazed O
at O
the O
mystic O

explained O
their O

before O
me O
of O
perpetual O
youth O

     | O
enjoyment O

At O
that O
moment O
a O
demon O
whispered O
in O
my O
ear O
, O
‘ O
This O

be O
thine O

“ O

Darcy B-PERSON

“ O
Instantly O
drawing O

     | O
my O
poniard O

I O
plunged O
it O

rabbi O

mark O
what O
followed O
. O
His O
blood O
fell O
upon O
the O

     | O
book O

obliterated O
the O

“ O

you O
regain O

asked O
Auriol B-PERSON
curiously O
. O

  | O
“ O
To O

Darcy—“within O

doubting O
the O

left O
it O

I O
went O
forth O

, O

     | O
as O
he O

eagerly O

     | O
drained O

His O

dilated O
with O

Striding O

| 
  | O
“ O
A B-DATE

he O
thought O

“ O

As O
he O
ruminated O
thus O
, O
the O
skeleton O
hanging O
near O

its O
bony O

came O
in O

A O

suggested O
by O
the O

“ O
There O

The O
Tinker B-ORG
replied O
in O
the O
affirmative O
  O
and O
the O
other O
had O
just O
become O
lost O
to O
consciousness O
, O

     | O
when O
he O
received O
a O

in O
the O

his O

“ O

some O
trepidation O

“ O

  | O
Slightly O
altering O
his O
position O
, O
the O
Sandman B-ORG
caught O
sight O
of O
a O
figure O
standing O
upon O
the O
planks O

     | O
above O
them O
. O
It O
was O
that O
of O
a O
young O

His O
hat O
was O
off O

and O
his O
features O
, O
exposed O
to O
the O
full O

     | O
radiance O
of O
the O
moon O
, O
looked O
deathly O
pale O
, O
and O
though O
handsome O
, O
had O
a O
strange O
sinister O
|
     | O
expression O
. O
He O
was O
tall O
, O
slight O
, O
and O
well O

  O

the O

“ O

in O
a O
voice O
so O

it O
thrilled O

With O
this O

vaulted O
upon O
the O

and O
peeping O
cautiously O
out O
of O
the O
open O
door O
to O
which O

     | O
they O
led O

saw O
the O

of O

scrutiny O
enter O
the O
adjoining O
house O
through O
a O
broken O
window O

Making O

Sandman B-PRODUCT

who O
was O
close O
at O
his O
heels O
, O
the O
Tinker B-ORG
crept O
forward O
on O
all O

     | O
fours O
, O
and O
, O
on O
reaching O
the O
window O
, O
raised O
himself O
just O
sufficiently O
to O
command O
the O
interior O
of O
|
     | O
the O
dwelling O
. O
Unfortunately O
for O
him O
, O
the O
moon O
was O
at O
this O
moment O
obscured O
, O
and O
he O
could O
|
     | O
distinguish O
nothing O
except O
the O
dusky O
outline O
of O
the O
various O
objects O
with O
which O
the O
place O
was O
|
     | O
filled O
, O
and O
which O
were O
nearly O
of O
the O
same O
kind O
as O
those O
of O
the O
neighbouring O
habitation O
. O
He O
|
     | O
listened O
intently O
, O
but O
not O
the O
slightest O
sound O
reached O
his O
ears O
. O
| 
  | O
After O
some O
time O
spent O
in O
this O
way O
, O
he O
began O
to O
fear O
the O
young O
man O
must O
have O
departed O
, O
when O
|
     | O
all O
at O
once O
a O
piercing O
scream O
resounded O
through O
the O
dwelling O
. O
Some O
heavy O
matter O
was O
dislodged O
, O

     | O
with O
a O
thundering O
crash O
, O

footsteps O
were O
heard O
approaching O
the O
window O

  | O
Hastily O
retreating O
to O
their O
former O
hiding O
- O
place O
, O
the O
Tinker B-ORG
and O
his O
companion O
had O
scarcely O
|
     | O
regained O
it O
, O
when O
the O
young O
man O
again O
appeared O
on O
the O
plank O
. O
His O
demeanour O
had O
undergone O
a O
|
     | O
fearful O
change O
. O
He O
staggered O
rather O
than O
walked O
, O
and O
his O
countenance O
was O
even O
paler O
than O
|
     | O
before O
. O
Having O
crossed O
the O
plank O
, O
he O
took O
his O
way O
along O
the O
top O
of O
the O
broken O
wall O
towards O
the O
|
     | O
door O
. O

“ O

The O
other O
nodded O
, O
and O
, O
grasping O
his O
mallet O
with O
a O
deadly O
and O
determined O
purpose O
, O
sprang O
|
     | O
noiselessly O
upon O
the O
wall O
, O
and O
overtook O
his O
intended O
victim O
just O
before O
he O
gained O
the O
door O
. O
| 
  | O
Hearing O
a O
sound O
behind O
him O
, O
the O
young O
man O
turned O
, O
and O
only O
just O
became O
conscious O
of O
the O
|
     | O
presence O
of O
the O
Sandman B-PRODUCT
, O
when O
the O
mallet O
descended O
upon O
his O
head O
, O
and O
he O
fell O
crushed O
and O

     | O
senseless O
to O
the O
ground O
. O

  | O
“ O

cried O
the O

to O
his O

instantly O
came O
up O

into O
a O
roar O

Their O
hilarity O
, O

was O
suddenly O
checked O
by O
an O
inquiry O
from O
the O

in O
a O
shrill O

odd O

not O

much O
that O

I O

     | O
heard O
sufficient O

“ O

there O

extended O

on O
the O

I O
found O
the O
dead O

I O
debated O

what O

whether O

     | O
pursue O
his O

such O
I O
accounted O
the O
young O

, O
on O
reflection O
, O
I O
thought O
the O

     | O
course O
useless O

I O
next O
looked O
round O
to O
see O
whether O
the O
precious O
elixir O
was O
gone O

On O
the O
table O

     | O
stood O
a O
phial O

from O
which O
a O
strong O
spirituous O
odour O
exhaled O
  O
but O
it O
was O
empty O
. O
I O
then O
turned O
my O

     | O
attention O
to O
a O
receiver O
, O
connected O
by O
a O
worm O
with O
an O
alembic O
on O
the O
furnace O
. O
On O
examining O
it O
, O
I O
|
     | O
found O
it O
contained O
a O
small O
quantity O
of O
a O
bright O
transparent O
liquid O
, O
which O
, O
poured O
forth O
into O
a O

     | O
glass O
, O
emitted O
precisely O
the O
same O
odour O
as O
the O
phial O
. O
Persuaded O
this O
must O
be O
the O
draught O
of O

     | O
immortality O
, O
I O
raised O
it O
to O
my O
lips O
  O

apprehension O
lest O
it O
might O
be O
poison O
stayed O
my O
hand O

     | O
Reassured O
, O
however O
, O
by O
the O
thought O
of O
the O
young O
man O
’s O
miraculous O
recovery O
, O
I O
quaffed O
the O

     | O
potion O

It O
was O
as O
if O
I O
had O
swallowed O
fire O
, O
and O
at O
first O
I O
thought O
all O
was O
over O
with O
me O
. O
I O
|
     | O
shrieked O
out O
  O
but O
there O
was O
no O
one O
to O
heed O
my O
cries O
, O
unless O
it O
were O
my O
dead O
master O

and O
two B-CARDINAL
or O

     | O
three B-CARDINAL
skeletons O
with O
which O
the O
walls O
were O
garnished O

these O

in O
truth O

did O
seem O
to O
hear O

     | O
for O
the O
dead O
corpse O
opened O
its O
glassy O
orbs O
, O
and O
eyed O
me O
reproachfully O
  O
the O
skeletons O
shook O
|
     | O
their O
fleshless O
arms O
and O
gibbered O
  O

the O
various O
strange O
objects O

with O
which O
the O
chamber O
was O

filled O

deride O

me O

The O
terror O
occasioned O
by O

combined O
with O
|
     | O
the O
potency O
of O
the O
draught O
, O
took O
away O
my O
senses O

When O

I O
found O
all O
tranquil O

Her O

slight O

tall O

and O
ravishingly O

a O
slender O

little O

     | O

almost O

angelic O

Ebba B-PERSON

     | O
countenance O

a O
type O
of O
Saxon B-PERSON
beauty O

Her O
complexion O
was O
pure O
white O

tinged O
with O
a O
slight O

     | O
bloom O

Her O
eyes O
were O
of O
a O
serene O
summer B-DATE
blue O
, O
arched O
over O
by O
brows O
some O

darker O

     | O
radiant O
tresses O
that O
fell O
on O
either O

were O
parted O
over O
a O
brow O
smoother O
than O
alabaster O
. O
|
     | O
Her O
attire O
was O
simple O
but O
tasteful O
, O
and O
by O
its O
dark O
colour O
threw O
into O

the O

     | O
fairness O
of O
her O

Beyond O

an O

where O
the O

busy O
at O

| 
  | O
Though O
it O
was O
still O
early O
, O
the O
road O
was O
astir O
with O
passengers O
  O

many O
waggons O

     | O
laden O

Ebba B-PERSON
, O
however O
, O
had O
been O
solely O
drawn O
forth O
|
     | O
by O
the O
beauty O
of O
the B-TIME
morning I-TIME
, O
and O
she O
stopped O
for O
a O
moment O
at O
the B-FAC
street I-FAC
gate I-FAC
, O
to O
breathe O
the O
|
     | O
balmy O
air O
. O
As O
she O
inhaled O
the O
gentle O
breeze O
, O
and O
felt O
the O
warm O
sunshine O
upon O
her O
cheek O
, O
her O
|
     | O
thoughts O
wandered O
away O
into O
the O
green O
meadows O
in O
which O
she O
had O
strayed O
as O
a O
child O
, O
and O
she O
|
     | O
longed O
to O
ramble O
amid O
them O
again O
. O
Perhaps O
she O
scarcely O
desired O
a O
solitary O
stroll O
  O
but O
however O
|
     | O
this O
might O
be O
, O
she O
was O
too O
much O
engrossed O
by O
the O
reverie O
to O
notice O
a O
tall O
man O
, O
wrapped O
in O
a O
|
     | O
long O
black O
cloak O
, O
who O
regarded O
her O
with O
the O
most O
fixed O
attention O
, O
as O
he O
passed O
on O
the O
opposite O
|
     | O
side O
of O
the O
road O
. O
| 
  | O
Proceeding O
to O
a O
short O
distance O
, O
this O
personage O
crossed O
over O
, O
and O
returned O
slowly O
towards O
the O
|
     | O
iron O
- O
merchant O
’s O
dwelling O
. O
Ebba B-PERSON
then O
, O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
, O
remarked O
him O
, O
and O
was O
startled O
by O
his O
|
     | O
strange O
, O
sinister O
appearance O
. O
His O
features O
were O
handsome O
, O
but O
so O
malignant O
and O
fierce O
in O
|
     | O
expression O
, O
that O
they O
inspired O
only O
aversion O
. O
A O
sardonic O
grin O
curled O
his O
thin O
lips O
, O
and O
his O
|
     | O
short O
, O
crisply O
curled O
hair O
, O
raven O
- O
black O
in O
hue O
, O
contrasted O
forcibly O
and O
disagreeably O
with O
his O
|
     | O
cadaverous O
complexion O
. O
An O
attraction O
like O
that O
of O
the O
snake O
seemed O
to O
reside O
in O
his O
dark O
|
     | O
blazing O
eyes O
, O
for O
Ebba B-PERSON
trembled O
like O
a O
bird O
beneath O
their O
influence O
, O
and O
could O
not O
remove O
her O
|
     | O
gaze O
from O
them O
. O
A O
vague O
presentiment O
of O
coming O
ill O
smote O
her O
, O
and O
she O
dreaded O
lest O
the O
|
     | O
mysterious O
being O
before O
her O
might O
be O
connected O
in O
some O
inexplicable O
way O
with O
her O
future O
|
     | O
destiny O
. O
| 
  | O
On O
his O
part O
, O
the O
stranger O
was O
not O
insensible O
to O
the O
impression O
he O
had O
produced O
, O
and O
suddenly O
|
     | O
halting O
, O
he O
kept O
his O
eyes O
riveted O
on O
those O
of O
the O
girl O
, O
who O
, O
after O
remaining O
spell O
- O
bound O
, O
as O
it O
|
     | O
were O
, O
for O
a O
few O
moments O
, O
precipitately O
retreated O
towards O
the O
house O
. O
| 
  | O
Just O
as O
she O
reached O
the O
door O
, O
and O
was O
about O
to O
pass O
through O
it O
, O
Auriol B-PERSON
came O
forth O
. O
He O
was O
|
     | O
pale O
, O
as O
if O
from O
recent O
suffering O
, O
and O
bore O
his O
left O
arm O
in O
a O
sling O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
You O
look O
agitated O
, O
” O
he O
said O
, O
noticing O
Ebba B-PERSON
’s O
uneasiness O
. O
“ O
What O
has O
happened O
? O
” O
| 
  | O
“ O
Not O
much O
, O
” O
she O
replied O
, O
a O
deep O
blush O
mantling O
her O
cheeks O
. O
“ O
But O
I O
have O
been O
somewhat O
alarmed O
|
     | O
by O
the O
person O
near O
the O
gate O
. O
” O
| 
  | O
“ O
Indeed O
! O
” O
cried O
Auriol B-PERSON
, O
darting O
forward O

“ O
Where O
is O
he O
? O
I O
see O

“ O

man O

wrapped O
in O
a O
long O
black O
cloak O

rejoined O
Ebba B-PERSON
, O
following O
him O
cautiously O
. O

  | O
“ O
Ha O
! O
” O
cried O
Auriol B-PERSON

“ O
Has O
he O
been O
here O

“ O
Then O
you O
know O
the O
person O
I O
allude O
to O
? O
” O
she O
rejoined O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
I O
know O
some O
one O
answering O
his O
description O
, O
” O
he O
replied O
, O
with O
a O
forced O
smile O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
Once O
beheld O
, O
the O
man O
I O
mean O
is O
not O
to O
be O
forgotten O
, O
” O
said O
Ebba B-PERSON
. O
“ O
He O
has O
a O
countenance O
such O

     | O
as O
I O
never O
saw O
before O
. O
If O
I O
could O
believe O
in O
the O
‘ O
evil O
eye O

’ O
I O
should O

“ O

Auriol B-PERSON

in O
a O
sombre O
tone O

  | O
“ O
Who O
and O
what O
is O
he O
, O
then O
? O
” O
demanded O
Ebba B-PERSON

“ O
He O

Auriol B-PERSON

“ O

I O

” O
| 
  | O
“ O
Are O
you O
quite O
sure O
of O
it O
? O
” O
she O
asked O
, O
glancing O
timorously O
up O
and O
down O
the O
road O
. O
But O
the O

     | O
mysterious O

could O
no O

be O
seen O

“ O
And O
so O
, O
after O

my O
curiosity O

you O

she O
said O

“ O
I O

rejoined O
Auriol B-PERSON

somewhat O
sternly O

“ O
Nay O

Ebba B-PERSON
stopped O

the O
bloom O
suddenly O
forsook O
her O

a O
profound O

     | O
silence O
prevailed O
between O
them O
for O
a O
few O
moments O
. O

  | O
“ O
Ebba B-PERSON
, O
” O
said O
Auriol B-PERSON
at O
length O
, O
“ O
I O

” O

  | O
“ O
Why O
so O
soon O
? O
” O
she O
exclaimed O
, O
looking O
up O
into O
his O
face O
. O
“ O
You O

“ O
I O

he O
said O

“ O
Dare O
not O

cried O
Ebba B-PERSON

And O
she O
again O
cast O
down O
her O
eyes O
  O
but O
Auriol B-PERSON
made O
no O
reply O
. O

  | O
Fortunately O
the O
silence O
was O
broken O
by O
the O
clinking O
of O
the O

hammers O
upon O
the O
anvil O

“ O
If O
you O

really O
go O

said O
Ebba B-PERSON
, O
looking O
up O
, O
after O
a O
long O
pause O
, O
“ O
I O

” O
| 
  | O
“ O
Most O
assuredly O
, O
” O
replied O
Auriol B-WORK_OF_ART
. O
“ O
I O
owe O
your O

“ O

she O

“ O
I O
am O

There O
was O
another O
pause O

during O
which O
a O
stout O

fellow O
in O
the O
workshop O
quitted O
the O

     | O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
and O
, O
catching O
a O
glimpse O
of O
the O
young O

to O
his O

again O

“ O

this O

Ebba B-PERSON

me O

     | O
as O
a O
monster O

you O

rather O

plunge O
into O
them O
, O
if O
I O
could O
find O
repose O
, O
” O
he O
murmured O
. O
“ O
But O
it O
would O
avail O
nothing O
. O
|
     | O
I O
should O
only O
add O
to O
my O
sufferings O
. O
No O
  O
I O
must O
continue O
to O
endure O
the O
weight O
of O
a O
life O
burdened O
|
     | O
by O
crime O
and O
remorse O
, O
till O
I O
can O
find O
out O
the O
means O
of O
freeing O
myself O
from O
it O
. O
Once O
I O
dreaded O
|
     | O
this O
unknown O
danger O
, O
but O
now O
I O
seek O
for O
it O
in O
vain O
. O
” O
| 
  | O
The O
current O
of O
his O
thoughts O
was O
here O
interrupted O
by O
the O
sudden O
appearance O
of O
a O
dark O
object O
on O
|
     | O
the O
surface O
of O
the O
water O
, O
which O
he O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
took O
to O
be O
a O
huge O
fish O
, O
with O
a O
pair O
of O
green O
fins O
|
     | O
springing O
from O
its O
back O
  O
but O
after O
watching O
it O
more O
closely O
for O
a O
few O
moments O
, O
he O
became O
|
     | O
convinced O
that O
it O
was O
a O
human O
being O
, O
tricked O
out O
in O
some O
masquerade O
attire O
, O
while O
the O
slight O
|
     | O
struggles O
which O
it O
made O
proved O
that O
life O
was O
not O
entirely O
extinct O
. O
| 
  | O
Though O
, O
the O
moment O
before O
, O
he O
had O
contemplated O
self O
- O
destruction O
, O
and O
had O
only O
been O
restrained O
|
     | O
from O
the O
attempt O
by O
the O
certainty O
of O
failing O
in O
his O
purpose O
, O
instinct O
prompted O
him O
to O
rescue O
|
     | O
the O
perishing O
creature O
before O
him O
. O
Without O
hesitation O
, O
therefore O
, O
and O
without O
tarrying O
to O
|
     | O
divest O
himself O
of O
his O
clothes O
, O
he O
dashed O
into O
the O
water O
, O
and O
striking O
out O
, O
instantly O
reached O
|
     | O
the O
object O
of O
his O
quest O
, O
which O
still O
continued O
to O
float O
, O
and O
turning O
it O
over O
, O
for O
the O
face O
was O
|
     | O
downwards O
, O
he O
perceived O
it O
was O
an O
old O
man O
, O
of O
exceedingly O
small O
size O
, O
habited O
in O
a O
pantomimic O
|
     | O
garb O
. O
He O
also O
remarked O
that O
a O
rope O
was O
twisted O
round O
the O
neck O
of O
the O
unfortunate O
being O
, O
making O
|
     | O
it O
evident O
that O
some O
violent O
attempt O
had O
been O
made O
upon O
his O
life O
. O
| 
  | O
Without O
pausing O
for O
further O
investigation O
, O
he O
took O
firm O
hold O
of O
the O
leathern O
wings O
of O
the O
|
     | O
dwarf O
, O
and O
with O
his O
disengaged O
hand O
propelled O
himself O
towards O
the O
shore O
, O
dragging O
the O
other O
|
     | O
after O
him O
. O
The O
next O
instant O
he O
reached O
the O
bank O
, O
clambered O
up O
the O
low O
brickwork O
, O
and O
placed O
his O
|
     | O
burden O
in O
safety O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
noise O
of O
the O
plunge O
had O
attracted O
attention O
, O
and O
several O
persons O
now O
hurried O
to O
the O
spot O
. O
|
     | O
On O
coming O
up O
, O
and O
finding O
Auriol B-PERSON
bending O
over O
a O
water O
- O
sprite O
— O
for O
such O
, O
at O
first O
sight O
, O
the O
|
     | O
dwarf O
appeared O
— O
they O
could O
not O
repress O
their O
astonishment O
. O
Wholly O
insensible O
to O
the O
presence O
of O
|
     | O
those O
around O
him O
, O
Auriol B-PERSON
endeavoured O
to O
recall O
where O
he O
had O
seen O
the O
dwarf O
before O
. O
All O
at O
once O
, O
|
     | O
the O
recollection O
flashed O
upon O
him O
, O
and O
he O
cried O
aloud O
, O
“ O
Why O
, O
it O
is O
my O
poor O
murdered O
|
     | O
grandfather O
’s O
attendant O
, O
Flapdragon B-GPE
! O
But O
no O
! O
no!—he O
must O
be O
dead O
ages O
ago O
! O
Yet O
the O
resemblance O
|
     | O
is O
singularly O
striking O
! O
” O
| 
  | O
Auriol B-PERSON
’s O
exclamations O
, O
coupled O
with O
his O
wild O
demeanour O
, O
surprised O
the O
bystanders O
, O
and O
they O
|
     | O
came O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
he O
must O
be O
a O
travelling O
showman O
, O
who O
had O
attempted O
to O
drown O
his O
|
     | O
dwarf O
— O
the O
grotesque O
, O
impish O
garb O
of O
the O
latter O
convincing O
them O
that O
he O
had O
been O
exhibited O
at O
a O
|
     | O
booth O
. O
They O
made O
signs O
, O
therefore O
, O
to O
each O
other O
not O
to O
let O
Auriol B-PERSON
escape O
, O
and O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
, O
|
     | O
raising O
the O
dwarf O
’s O
head O
on O
his O
knee O
, O
produced O
a O
flask O
, O
and O
poured O
some O
brandy O
from O
it O
down O
his O
|
     | O
throat O
, O
while O
others O
chafed O
his O
hands O
. O
These O
efforts O
were O
attended O
with O
much O
speedier O
success O
|
     | O
than O
might O
have O
been O
anticipated O
. O
After O
a O
struggle O
or O
two B-CARDINAL
for O
respiration O
, O
the O
dwarf O
opened O
his O
|
     | O
eyes O
, O
and O
gazed O
at O
the O
group O
around O
him O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
It O
must O
be O
Flapdragon B-ORG
! O
” O
exclaimed O
Auriol B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
Ah O
! O
who O
calls O
me O
? O
” O
cried O
the O
dwarf O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
I O
! O
” O
rejoined O
Auriol B-PERSON
. O
“ O
Do O
you O
not O
recollect O
me O
? O
” O
| 
  | O
“ O
To O
be O
sure O
! O
” O
exclaimed O
the O
dwarf O
, O
gazing O
at O
him O
fixedly O
  O
“ O
you O
are O
— O
— O
” O
and O
he O
stopped O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
You O
have O
been O
thrown O
into O
the O
water O
, O
Master O
Flapdragon B-PERSON
? O
” O
cried O
a O
bystander O
, O
noticing O
the O
|
     | O
cord O
round O
the O
dwarf O
’s O
throat O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
I O
have O
, O
” O
replied O
the O
little O
old O
man O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
By O
your O
governor O
— O
that O
is O
, O
by O
this O
person O
? O
” O
cried O
another O
, O
laying O
hold O
of O
Auriol B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
By O
him O
— O
no O
, O
” O
said O
the O
dwarf O
  O
“ O
I O
have O
not O
seen O
that O
gentleman O
for O
nearly B-DATE
three I-DATE
centuries I-DATE
. O
” O
| 
  | O
“ O
Three B-DATE
centuries I-DATE
, O
my O
little O
patriarch O
? O
” O
said O
the O
man O
who O
had O
given O
him O
the O
brandy O
. O
“ O
That O
’s O
a O
|
     | O
long O
time O
. O
Think O
again O
. O
” O
| 
  | O
“ O
It O
’s O
perfectly O
true O
, O
nevertheless O
, O
” O
replied O
the O
dwarf O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
His O
wits O
have O
been O
washed O
away O
by O
the O
water O
, O
” O
said O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
speaker O
. O
“ O
Give O
him O
a O
drop O
more O
|
     | O
brandy O
. O
” O
| 
  | O
“ O
Not O
a O
bit O
of O
it O
, O
” O
rejoined O
the O
dwarf O
  O
“ O
my O
senses O
were O
never O
clearer O
than O
at O
this O
moment O
. O
At O
|
     | O
last O
we O
have O
met O
, O
” O
he O
continued O
, O
addressing O
Auriol B-PERSON
, O
“ O
and O
I O
hope O
we O
shall O
not O
speedily O
part O

     | O
again O

We O
hold O
life O
by O
the O
same O
tie O
. O
” O
| 
  | O
“ O
How O
came O
you O
in O
the O
desperate O
condition O
in O
which O
I O
found O
you O
? O
” O
demanded O
Auriol B-PERSON
|
     | O
evasively O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
I O
was O
thrown O
into O
the O
canal O
with O
a O
stone O
to O
my O
neck O
, O
like O
a O
dog O
about O
to O
be O
drowned O
, O
” O
|
     | O
replied O
the O
dwarf O
. O
“ O
But O
, O
as O
you O
are O
aware O
, O
I O
’m O
not O
so O
easily O
disposed O
of O
. O
” O
| 
  | O
Again O
the O
bystanders O
exchanged O
significant O
looks O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
By O
whom O
was O
the O
attempt O
made O
? O
” O
inquired O
Auriol B-WORK_OF_ART
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
I O
do O
n’t O
know O
the O
villain O
’s O
name O
, O
” O
rejoined O
the O
dwarf O
, O
“ O
but O
he O
’s O
a O
very O
tall O
, O
dark O
man O
, O
and O
|
     | O
is O
generally O
wrapped O
in O
a O
long O
black O
cloak O
. O
” O
| 
  | O
“ O
Ha O
! O
” O
exclaimed O
Auriol B-PERSON
. O
“ O
When O
was O
it O
done O
? O
” O
| 
  | O
“ O
Some B-DATE
nights I-DATE
ago I-DATE
, O
I O
should O
fancy O
, O
” O
replied O
the O
dwarf O
, O
“ O
for O
I O
’ve O
been O
a O
terrible O
long O
time O

     | O
under O
water O
. O
I O
have O
only O
just O
managed O
to O
shake O
off O
the O
stone O
. O
” O
| 
  | O
At O
this O
speech O
there O
was O
a O
titter O
of O
incredulity O
among O
the O
bystanders O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
You O
may O
laugh O
, O
but O
it O
’s O
true O

” O
cried O
the O
dwarf O
angrily O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
We O
must O
speak O
of O
this O
anon O
, O
” O
said O
Auriol B-PERSON
. O
“ O
Will O
you O
convey O
him O
to O
the O
nearest O
tavern O
? O
” O
he O
|
     | O
added O
, O
placing O
money O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
man O
who O
held O
the O
dwarf O
in O
his O
arms O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
Willingly O

sir O

” O
replied O
the O
man O
. O
“ O
I O

the B-ORG

near O
the O

“ O
I O
’ll O
join O
him O
there O
in O
an B-TIME
hour I-TIME
, O
” O
replied O
Auriol B-PERSON
, O
moving O
away O
. O
| 
  | O
And O
as O
he O
disappeared O
, O
the O
man O
took O
up O
his O
little O
burden O
, O
and O
bent O
his O
steps O
towards O
the O
|
     | O
barracks O
. O
| 
  | O
Utterly O
disregarding O
the O
dripping O
state O
of O
his O
habiliments O
, O
Auriol B-PERSON
proceeded O
quickly O
to O
the O
|
     | O
place O
of O
rendezvous O
. O
Arrived O
there O
, O
he O
looked O
around O
, O
and O
not O
seeing O
any O
one O
, O
flung O
himself O
|
     | O
upon O
a O
bench O
at O
the O
foot O
of O
the O
gentle O
eminence O
on O
which O
the O
gigantic O
statue O
of O
Achilles B-GPE
is O
|
     | O
placed O
. O
| 
  | O
It O
was O
becoming O
rapidly O
dark O
, O
and O
heavy O
clouds O
, O
portending O
speedy O
rain O
, O
increased O
the O
gloom O
. O
|
     | O
Auriol B-PERSON
’s O
thoughts O
were O
sombre O
as O
the O
weather O
and O
the B-TIME
hour I-TIME
, O
and O
he O
fell O
into O
a O
deep O
fit O
of O
|
     | O
abstraction O
, O
from O
which O
he O
was O
roused O
by O
a O
hand O
laid O
on O
his O
shoulder O
. O
| 
  | O
Recoiling O
at O
the O
touch O
, O
he O
raised O
his O
eyes O
, O
and O
beheld O
the O
stranger O
leaning O
over O
him O
, O
and O
|
     | O
gazing O
at O
him O
with O
a O
look O
of O
diabolical O
exultation O
. O
The O
cloak O
was O
thrown O
partly O
aside O
, O
so O
as O
to O
|
     | O
display O
the O
tall O
, O
gaunt O
figure O
of O
its O
wearer O
  O

the O
large O
collar O
of O
sable O
fur O
with O
which O
it O

     | O
was O
decorated O
stood O
out O
like O
the O
wings O
of O
a O
demon O

The O
stranger O
’s O
hat O
was O
off O
, O
and O
his O
high O

     | O
broad O
forehead O
, O
white O
as O
marble O
, O
was O
fully O
revealed O

“ O
Our O

he O

I O

the O

when O
I O

     | O

I O

something O

me O

appeared O
ready O

no O

Mr. O

One B-CARDINAL

the O

     | O

breathed O

“ O
Oh O

he O

“ O
I O

I O
warned O

perhaps O
it O

“ O

release O
me O

” O

“ O
In O
a O
few O
moments O
the O
fit O
will O
be O
passed O

she O
rejoined O

“ O

us O
walk O
towards O
the O
abbey O

“ O
It O
is O
in O
vain O

” O
ejaculated O
Auriol B-PERSON
despairingly O
. O
| 
  | O
And O
he O
suffered O
himself O
to O
be O
led O
in O
the O
direction O
proposed O
. O
| 
  | O
Ebba B-PERSON
continued O
to O
talk O
, O
but O
her O
discourse O
fell O
upon O
a O
deaf O
ear O
, O
and O
at O
last O
she O
became O
silent O
|
     | O
too O
. O
In O
this O
way O
they O
proceeded O
along O
Millbank B-FAC
Street I-FAC

Abingdon B-FAC
Street I-FAC
, O
until O
, O
turning O
off O
|
     | O
on O
the O
right O
, O
they O
found O
themselves O
before O
an O
old O
and O
partly O
- O
demolished O
building O
. O
By O
this O
time O
|
     | O
it O
had O
become O
quite O
dark O
, O
for O
the O
moon O
was O
hidden O
behind O
a O
rack O
of O
clouds O
, O
but O
a O
light O
was O
seen O
|
     | O
in O
the O
upper O
storey O
of O
the O
structure O
, O
occasioned O
, O
no O
doubt O
, O
by O
a O
fire O
within O
it O
, O
which O
gave O
a O
|
     | O
very O
picturesque O
effect O
to O
the O
broken O
outline O
of O
the O
walls O
. O
| 
  | O
Pausing O
for O
a O
moment O
to O
contemplate O
the O
ruin O
, O
Ebba B-PERSON
expressed O
a O
wish O
to O
enter O
it O
. O
Auriol B-PERSON
|
     | O
offered O
no O
opposition O
, O
and O
passing O
through O
an O
arched O
doorway O
, O
and O
ascending O
a O
short O
, O
spiral O
, O
|
     | O
stone O
staircase O
, O
they O
presently O
arrived O
at O
a O
roofless O
chamber O
, O
which O
it O
was O
evident O
, O
from O
the O
|
     | O
implements O
and O
rubbish O
lying O
about O
, O
was O
about O
to O
be O
razed O
to O
the O
ground O
. O
On O
one B-CARDINAL
side O
there O
was O
|
     | O
a O
large O
arch O
, O
partly O
bricked O
up O
, O
through O
which O
opened O
a O
narrow O
doorway O
, O
though O
at O
some O
height O
|
     | O
from O
the O
ground O
. O
With O
this O
a O
plank O
communicated O
, O
while O
beneath O
it O
lay O
a O
great O
heap O
of O
stones O
, O
|
     | O
amongst O
which O
were O
some O
grotesque O
carved O
heads O
. O
In O
the O
centre O
of O
the O
chamber O
was O
a O
large O
square O
|
     | O
opening O
, O
like O
the O
mouth O
of O
a O
trap O
- O
door O
, O
from O
which O
the O
top O
of O
a O
ladder O
projected O
, O
and O
near O
it O
|
     | O
stood O
a O
flaming O
brazier O
, O
which O
had O
cast O
forth O
the O
glare O
seen O
from O
below O
. O
Over O
the O
ruinous O
walls O
|
     | O
on O
the O
right O
hung O
the O
crescent O
moon O
, O
now O
emerged O
from O
the O
cloud O
, O
and O
shedding O
a O
ghostly O
glimmer O
|
     | O
on O
the O
scene O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
What O
a O
strange O
place O
! O
” O
cried O
Ebba B-PERSON
, O
gazing O
around O
with O
some O
apprehension O
. O
“ O
It O
looks O
like O
a O
|
     | O
spot O
one B-CARDINAL
reads O
of O
in O

. O
I O
wonder O
where O
that O
trap O
leads O
to O
? O
” O
| 
  | O
“ O
Into O
the O
vault O
beneath O

no O

, O
” O
replied O
Auriol B-WORK_OF_ART
. O
“ O
But O
why O
did O
we O
come O
hither O
? O
” O
| 
  | O
As O
he O
spoke O
, O
there O
was O
a O
sound O
like O
mocking O
laughter O
, O
but O
whence O
arising O
it O
was O
difficult O
to O

     | O
say O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
Did O
you O
hear O
that O
sound O
? O
” O
cried O
Auriol B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
It O
was O
nothing O
but O
the O
echo O
of O
laughter O
from O
the O
street O

she O
replied O

“ O

“ O
No O

“ O

from O

And O
they O
beheld O
the O
mysterious O
owner O
of O
the O
black O

barring O
their O
passage O
out O

“ O

“ O
Remember O

a O
mocking O
laugh O

“ O
Oh O

” O
cried O
Ebba B-PERSON

“ O
I O
fear O

, O
as O
he O
spoke O

he O
advanced O
towards O
her O

enveloping O
her O
in O
his O
cloak O

her O
cries O

“ O

And O
he O
stamped O
on O
the O
ground O

At O
this O
signal O
an O

     | O

While O

took O

the O

bore O

swiftly O
up O

     | O
the O

just O

he O
pointed O
towards O

rejoined O

  O
“ O

your O

“ O
The O

“ O
You O

also O

“ O
Anything O
more O
? O

asked O
the O
iron O

merchant O
. O

“ O
You O

engage O

“ O
All O
then O

“ O

we O
can O
now O
set O
out O

” O
| 
  | O
Upon O
this O
, O
Ginger B-ORG
conducted O
Mr. O
Thorneycroft B-PERSON
to O
the O
coach O
, O
and O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
latter O
got O
into O
|
     | O
it O
, O
tied O
a O
handkerchief O
tightly O
over O
his O
eyes O
. O
In O
this O
state O
Mr. O
Thorneycroft B-PERSON
heard O
the O
Tinker B-PRODUCT
|
     | O
and O
the O
Sandman B-PRODUCT
take O
their O
places O
near O
him O
, O
but O
not O
remarking O
the O
voice O
of O
Reeks B-GPE
, O
concluded O
|
     | O
that O
he O
must O
have O
got O
outside O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
next O
moment O
, O
the O
coach O
was O
put O
in O
motion O
, O
and O
rattled O
over O
the O
stones O
at O
a O
rapid O
pace O
. O
It O

     | O
made O
many O
turns O
  O
but O
at O
length O
proceeded O
steadily O
onwards O
, O
while O
from O
the O
profound O
silence O

     | O
around O
, O
and O
the O
greater O
freshness O
of O
the O
air O
, O
Mr. O
Thorneycroft B-PERSON
began O
to O
fancy O
they O
had O
gained O
|
     | O
the O
country O
. O
Not O
a O
word O
was O
spoken O
by O
any O
one O
during O
the O
ride O
. O
| 
  | O
After O
a O
while O
, O
the O
coach O
stopped O
, O
the O
door O
was O
opened O
, O
and O
Mr. O
Thorneycroft B-PERSON
was O
helped O
out O
. O
|
     | O
The O
iron O
- O
merchant O
expected O
his O
bandage O
would O
now O
be O
removed O
, O
but O
he O
was O
mistaken O
, O
for O
Reeks B-GPE
, O
|
     | O
taking O
his O
arm O
, O
drew O
him O
along O
at O
a O
quick O
pace O
. O
As O
they O
advanced O
, O
the O
iron O
- O
merchant O
’s O
conductor O
|
     | O
whispered O
him O
to O
be O
cautious O
, O
and O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
made O
him O
keep O
close O
to O
a O
wall O
. O
A O
door O
was O
|
     | O
presently O
opened O
, O
and O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
party O
had O
passed O
through O
, O
it O
closed O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
bandage O
was O
then O
removed O
from O
Thorneycroft B-GPE
’s O
eyes O
, O
and O
he O
found O
himself O
in O
a O
large O
and O
|
     | O
apparently O
neglected O
garden O
. O
Though O
the O
sky O
was O
cloudy O
, O
there O
was O
light O
enough O
to O
enable O
him O
to O
|
     | O
distinguish O
that O
they O
were O
near O
an O
old O
dilapidated O
mansion O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
We O
are O
now O
arrived O
, O
” O
said O
Reeks O
to O
the O
iron O

merchant O
, O
“ O
and O
you O
will O
have O

all O
your O

” O

“ O
I O
will O
deliver O
her O

or O
perish O
in O
the O
attempt O

” O
said O
Thorneycroft B-PERSON
, O
taking O
out O
his O
|
     | O
pistols O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
others O
drew O
their O
cutlasses O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
Now O
then O
, O
follow O
me O
, O
” O
said O
Reeks O

“ O
and O
act O
as O
I O
direct O

” O
| 
  | O
With O
this O
he O
struck O
into O
an O
alley O
formed O
by O
thick O
hedges O
of O
privet O

which O
brought O
them O
to O
the O

     | O
back O
part O
of O
the O
house O

Passing O
through O
a O
door O
, O
he O
entered O
the O
yard O
, O
and O
creeping O
cautiously O
|
     | O
along O
the O
wall O
, O
reached O
a O
low O
window O
, O
which O
he O
contrived O
to O
open O
without O
noise O
. O
He O
then O
passed O

     | O
through O
it O
, O
and O
was O
followed O

the O

We O

to O
the O
night O
of O
Ebba B-PERSON
’s O
seizure O
by O
the O
mysterious O
stranger O
. O
Though O
almost O
|
     | O
deprived O
of O
consciousness O
by O
terror O
, O
the O
poor O
girl O
could O
distinguish O
, O
from O
the O
movements O
of O
her O
|
     | O
captor O
, O
that O
she O
was O
borne O
down O
a O
flight O
of O
steps O
, O
or O
some O
steep O
descent O
, O
and O
then O
for O
a O
|
     | O
considerable O
distance O
along O
level O
ground O
. O
She O
was O
next O
placed O
in O
a O
carriage O
, O
which O
was O
driven O
|
     | O
with O
great O
swiftness O
, O
and O
though O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
conjecture O
in O
what O
direction O
she O
was O
|
     | O
conveyed O
, O
it O
seemed O
to O
her O
terrified O
imagination O
as O
if O
she O
were O
hurried O
down O
a O
precipice O
, O
and O
|
     | O
she O
expected O
every O
moment O
to O
be O
dashed O
in O
pieces O
. O
At O
length O
the O
vehicle O
stopped O
, O
and O
she O
was O
|
     | O
lifted O
out O
of O
it O
, O
and O
carried O
along O
a O
winding O
passage O
  O
after O
which O
, O
the O
creaking O
of O
hinges O
|
     | O
announced O
that O
a O
door O
was O
opened O
. O
Having O
passed O
through O
it O
, O
she O
was O
deposited O
on O
a O
bench O
, O
when O
, O
|
     | O
fright O
overmastering O
her O
, O
her O
senses O
completely O
forsook O
her O
. O
| 
  | O
On O
recovering O
, O
she O
found O
herself O
seated O
on O
a O
fauteuil O
covered O
with O
black O
velvet O
, O
in O
the O
midst O
|
     | O
of O
a O
gloomy O
chamber O
of O
vast O
extent O
, O
while O
beside O
her O
, O
and O
supporting O
her O
from O
falling O
, O
stood O
|
     | O
the O
mysterious O
and O
terrible O
stranger O
. O
He O
held O
a O
large O
goblet O
filled O
with O
some O
potent O
liquid O
to O
|
     | O
her O
lips O
, O
and O
compelled O
her O
to O
swallow O
a O
portion O
of O
it O
. O
The O
powerful O
stimulant O
revived O
her O
, O
|
     | O
but O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
produced O
a O
strange O
excitement O
, O
against O
which O
she O
struggled O
with O
all O
her O
|
     | O
power O
. O
Her O
persecutor O
again O
held O
the O
goblet O
towards O
her O
, O
while O
a O
sardonic O
smile O
played O
upon O
his O
|
     | O
features O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
Drink O
! O
” O
he O
cried O
  O
“ O
it O
will O
restore O
you O
, O
and O
you O
have O
much O
to O
go O
through O
. O
” O
| 
  | O
Ebba B-PERSON
mechanically O
took O
the O
cup O
, O
and O
raised O
it O
to O
her O
lips O
, O
but O
noticing O
the O
stranger O
’s O
glance O
|
     | O
of O
exultation O
, O
dashed O
it O
to O
the O
ground O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
You O
have O
acted O
foolishly O
, O
” O
he O
said O
sternly O
  O
“ O
the O
potion O
would O
have O
done O
you O
good O
. O
” O
| 
  | O
Withdrawing O
her O
eyes O
from O
his O
gaze O
, O
which O
she O
felt O
exercised O
an O
irresistible O
influence O
over O
|
     | O
her O
, O
Ebba B-PERSON
gazed O
fearfully O
round O
the O
chamber O
. O
| 
  | O
It O
was O
vast O
and O
gloomy O
, O
and O
seemed O
like O
the O
interior O
of O
a O
sepulchre O
— O
the O
walls O
and O
ceiling O
|
     | O
being O
formed O
of O
black O
marble O
, O
while O
the O
floor O
was O
paved O
with O
the O
same O
material O
. O
Not O
far O
from O
|
     | O
where O
she O
sat O
, O
on O
an O
estrade O
, O
approached O
by O
a O
couple O
of O
steps O
, O
stood O
a O
table O
covered O
with O
black O
|
     | O
velvet O
, O
on O
which O
was O
placed O
an O
immense O
lamp O
, O
fashioned O
like O
an O
imp O
supporting O
a O
caldron O
on O
his O
|
     | O
outstretched O
wings O
. O
In O
this O
lamp O
were O
several O
burners O
, O
which O
cast O
a O
lurid O
light O
throughout O
the O
|
     | O
chamber O
. O
Over O
it O
hung O
a O
cap O
equally O
fantastically O
fashioned O
. O
A O
dagger O
, O
with O
a O
richly O
wrought O
|
     | O
hilt O
, O
was O
stuck O
into O
the O
table O
  O
and O
beside O
it O
lay O
a O
strangely O
shaped O
mask O
, O
an O
open O
book O
, O
an O
|
     | O
antique O
inkstand O
, O
and O
a O
piece O
of O
parchment O
, O
on O
which O
some O
characters O
were O
inscribed O
. O
Opposite O
|
     | O
these O
stood O
a O
curiously O
carved O
ebony O
chair O
. O
| 
  | O
At O
the O
lower O
end O
of O
the O
room O
, O
which O
was O
slightly O
elevated O
above O
the O
rest O
, O
hung O
a O
large O
black O
|
     | O
curtain O
  O
and O
on O
the O
step O
, O
in O
the O
front O
of O
it O
, O
were O
placed O
two B-CARDINAL
vases O
of O
jet O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
What O
is O
behind O
that O
curtain O
? O
” O
shudderingly O
demanded O
Ebba B-PERSON
of O
her O
companion O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
You O
will O
see O
anon O
, O
” O
he O
replied O
. O
“ O
Meanwhile O
, O
seat O
yourself O
on O
that O
chair O
, O
and O
glance O
at O
the O
|
     | O
writing O
on O
the O
scroll O
. O
” O
| 
  | O
Ebba B-PERSON
did O
not O
move O
, O
but O
the O
stranger O
took O
her O
hand O
, O
and O
drew O
her O
to O
the O
seat O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
Read O
what O
is O
written O
on O
that O
paper O
, O
” O
he O
cried O
imperiously O
. O
| 
  | O
Ebba B-PERSON
glanced O
at O
the O
document O
, O
and O
a O
shudder O
passed O
over O
her O
frame O
. O
“ O
By O
this O
, O
” O
she O
cried O
, O
“ O
I O
|
     | O
surrender O
myself O
, O
soul O
and O
body O
, O
to O
you O
? O
” O
| 
  | O
“ O
You O
do O
, O
” O
replied O
the O
stranger O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
I O
have O
committed O
no O
crime O
that O
can O
place O
me O
within O
the O
power O
of O
the O
Fiend O
, O
” O
cried O
Ebba B-PERSON
, O
|
     | O
falling O
upon O
her O
knees O
. O
“ O
I O
call O
upon O
Heaven O
for O
protection O
! O
Avaunt O
! O
” O
| 
  | O
As O
the O
words O
were O
uttered O
, O
the O
cap O
suddenly O
fell O
upon O
the O
lamp O
, O
and O
the O
chamber O
was O
buried O
in O
|
     | O
profound O
darkness O
. O
Mocking O
laughter O
rang O
in O
her O
ears O
, O
succeeded O
by O
wailing O
cries O
inexpressibly O
|
     | O
dreadful O
to O
hear O
. O
| 
  | O
Ebba B-PERSON
continued O
to O
pray O
fervently O
for O
her O
own O
deliverance O
, O
and O
for O
that O
of O
Auriol B-EVENT
. O
In O
the O
|
     | O
midst O
of O
her O
supplications O
she O
was O
aroused O
by O
strains O
of O
music O
of O
the O
most O
exquisite O
sweetness O
, O
|
     | O
proceeding O
apparently O
from O
behind O
the O
curtain O
, O
and O
while O
listening O
to O
these O
sounds O
she O
was O
|
     | O
startled O
by O
a O
deafening O
crash O
as O
if O
a O
large O
gong O
had O
been O
stricken O
. O
The O
cover O
of O
the O
lamp O
was O
|
     | O
then O
slowly O
raised O
, O
and O
the O
burners O
blazed O
forth O
as O
before O
, O
while O
from O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
vases O
in O
front O
|
     | O
of O
the O
curtain O
arose O
clouds O
of O
incense O
, O
filling O
the O
chamber O
with O
stupefying O
fragrance O
. O
| 
  | O
Again O
the O
gong O
was O
stricken O
, O
and O
Ebba B-PERSON
looked O
round O
towards O
the O
curtain O
. O
Above O
each O
vase O
|
     | O
towered O
a O
gigantic O
figure O
, O
wrapped O
in O
a O
long O
black O
cloak O
, O
the O
lower O
part O
of O
which O
was O
concealed O
|
     | O
by O
the O
thick O
vapour O
. O
Hoods O
, O
like O
the O
cowls O
of O
monks O
, O
were O
drawn O
over O
the O
heads O
of O
these O
grim O
|
     | O
and O
motionless O
figures O
  O
mufflers O
enveloped O
their O
chins O
, O
and O
they O
wore O
masks O
, O
from O
the O
holes O
of O
|
     | O
which O
gleamed O
eyes O
of O
unearthly O
brightness O
. O
Their O
hands O
were O
crossed O
upon O
their O
breasts O
. O
|
     | O
Between O
them O
squatted O
two B-CARDINAL
other O
spectral O
forms O
, O
similarly O
cloaked O
, O
hooded O
, O
and O
masked O
, O
with O
|
     | O
their O
gleaming O
eyes O
fixed O
upon O
her O
, O
and O
their O
skinny O
fingers O
pointed O
derisively O
at O
her O
. O
| 
  | O
Behind O
the O
curtain O
was O
placed O
a O
strong O
light O
, O
which O
showed O
a O
wide O
staircase O
of O
black O
marble O
, O
|
     | O
leading O
to O
some O
upper O
chamber O
, O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
threw O
the O
reflection O
of O
a O
gigantic O
figure O
|
     | O
upon O
the O
drapery O
, O
while O
a O
hand O
, O
the O
finger O
of O
which O
pointed O
towards O
her O
, O
was O
thrust O
from O
an O

     | O
opening O
between O
its O
folds O
. O
| 
  | O
Forcibly O
averting O
her O
gaze O
, O
Ebba B-PERSON
covered O
her O
eyes O
with O
her O
hands O
, O
but O
looking O
up O
again O
after O
|
     | O
a O
brief O
space O
, O
beheld O
an O
ebon O
door O
at O
the O
side O
revolve O
upon O
its O
hinges O
, O
and O
give O
entrance O
to O
|
     | O
three O
female O
figures O
, O
robed O
in O
black O
, O
hooded O
and O
veiled O
, O
and O
having O
their O
hands O
folded O
, O
in O
a O
|
     | O
melancholy O
manner O
, O
across O
their O
breasts O
. O
Slowly O
and O
noiselessly O
advancing O
, O
they O
halted O
within O
a O
|
     | O
few O
paces O
of O
her O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
Who O
and O
what O
are O
ye O
? O
” O
she O
cried O
, O
wild O
with O
terror O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
The O
victims O
of O
Auriol B-ORG
! O
” O
replied O
the O
figure O
on O
the O
right O
. O
“ O
As O
we O
are O
, O
such O
will O
you O
be O
ere O
|
     | O
long O
. O
” O
| 
  | O
“ O
What O
crime O
have O
you O
committed O
? O
” O
demanded O
Ebba B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
We O
have O
loved O
him O
, O
” O
replied O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
figure O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
Is O
that O
a O
crime O
? O
” O
cried O
Ebba B-PERSON
. O
“ O
If O
so O
, O
I O
am O
equally O
culpable O
with O
you O
. O
” O
| 
  | O
“ O
You O
will O
share O
our O
doom O
, O
” O
replied O
the O
third B-ORDINAL
figure O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
Heaven O
have O
mercy O
upon O
me O
! O
” O
exclaimed O
the O
agonised O
girl O
, O
dropping O
upon O
her O
knees O
. O
| 
  | O
At O
this O
moment O
a O
terrible O
voice O
from O
behind O
the O
curtain O
exclaimed O
, O
“ O
Sign O
, O
or O
Auriol B-PERSON
is O
lost O
|
     | O
for O
ever O

” O
| 
  | O
“ O
I O
can O
not O
yield O
my O
soul O
, O
even O
to O
save O
him O

cried O
Ebba B-PERSON
distractedly O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
Witness O
his O
chastisement O
, O
then O
, O
” O
cried O
the O
voice O
. O
| 
  | O
And O
as O
the O
words O
were O
uttered O
, O
a O
side O
door O
was O
opened O
on O
the O
opposite O
side O
, O
and O
Auriol B-PERSON
was O
|
     | O
dragged O
forth O
from O
it O
by O
two B-CARDINAL
masked O
personages O
, O
who O
looked O
like O
familiars O
of O
the O
|
     | O
Inquisition O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
Do O
not O
yield O
to O
the O
demands O
of O
this O
fiend O
, O
Ebba B-PERSON
! O
” O
cried O
Auriol B-PERSON
, O
gazing O
at O
her O
|
     | O
distractedly O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
Will O
you O
save O
him O
before O
he O
is O
cast O
, O
living O
, O
into O
the O
tomb O
? O
” O
cried O
the O
voice O
. O
| 
  | O
And O
at O
the O
words O
, O
a O
heavy O
slab O
of O
marble O
rose O
slowly O
from O
the O
floor O
near O
where O
Ebba B-PERSON
sat O
, O
and O
|
     | O
disclosed O
a O
dark O
pit O
beneath O
. O
| 
  | O
Ebba B-PERSON
gazed O
into O
the O
abyss O
with O
indescribable O
terror O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
There O
he O
will O
be O
immured O
, O
unless O
you O
sign O
, O
” O
cried O
the O
voice O
  O
“ O
and O
, O
as O
he O
is O
immortal O
, O
he O
|
     | O
will O
endure O
an O
eternity O
of O
torture O
. O
” O
| 
  | O
“ O
I O
can O
not O
save O
him O
so O
, O
but O
I O
may O
precede O
him O
, O
” O
cried O
Ebba B-PERSON
. O
And O
throwing O
her O
hands O
aloft O
, O
she O
|
     | O
flung O
herself O
into O
the O
pit O
. O
| 
  | O
A O
fearful O
cry O
resounded O
through O
the O
chamber O
. O
It O
broke O
from O
Auriol B-PERSON
, O
who O
vainly O
strove O
to O
burst O
|
     | O
from O
those O
who O
held O
him O
, O
and O
precipitate O
himself O
after O
Ebba B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
Soon O
after O
this O
, O
and O
while O
Auriol B-PERSON
was O
gazing O
into O
the O
abyss O
, O
a O
tongue O
of O
blue O
flame O
arose O
|
     | O
from O
it O
, O
danced O
for O
a O
moment O
in O
the O
air O
, O
and O
then O
vanished O
. O
No O
sooner O
was O
it O
gone O
than O
a O
|
     | O
figure O
, O
shrouded O
in O
black O
habiliments O
, O
and O
hooded O
and O
muffled O
up O
like O
the O
three B-CARDINAL
other O
female O
|
     | O
forms O
, O
slowly O
ascended O
from O
the O
vault O
, O
apparently O
without O
support O
, O
and O
remained O
motionless O
at O
|
     | O
its O
brink O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
Ebba B-PERSON
! O
” O
exclaimed O
Auriol B-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
voice O
of O
despair O
. O
“ O
Is O
it O
you O
? O
” O
| 
  | O
The O
figure O
bowed O
its O
head O
, O
but O
spoke O
not O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
Sign O
! O
” O
thundered O
the O
voice O
. O
“ O
Your O
attempt O
at O
self O
- O

has O
placed O
you O
wholly O
in O
my O

     | O
power O
. O
Sign O
! O
” O
| 
  | O
At O
this O
injunction O
, O
the O
figure O
moved O
slowly O
towards O
the O
table O
, O
and O
to O
his O
unspeakable O
horror O
, O
|
     | O
Auriol B-PERSON
beheld O
it O
take O
up O
the O
pen O
and O
write O
upon O
the O
parchment O
. O
He O
bent O
forward O
, O
and O
saw O
that O
|
     | O
the O
name O
inscribed O
thereon O
was O
Ebba B-PERSON
Thorneycroft I-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
The O
groan O
to O
which O
he O
gave O
utterance O
was O
echoed O
by O
a O
roar O
of O
diabolical O
laughter O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
figure O
then O
moved O
slowly O
away O
, O
and O
ranged O
itself O
with O
the O
other O
veiled O
forms O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
All O
is O
accomplished O
, O
” O
cried O
the O
voice O
. O
“ O
Away O
with O
him O
! O
” O
| 
  | O
On O
this O
, O
a O
terrible O
clangour O
was O
heard O
  O
the O
lights O
were O
extinguished O
  O
and O
Auriol B-PERSON
was O
dragged O

     | O
through O
the O
doorway O
from O
which O
he O
had O
been O
brought O
forth O

  | O
Pausing O
before O
the O
portrait O
, O
the O
young O
man O
threw O
the O
light O
of O
the O
lantern O
full O
upon O
it O
, O
and O
|
     | O
revealed O
features O
somewhat O
resembling O
his O
own O
in O
form O
, O
but O
of O
a O
severe O
and O
philosophic O
cast O
. O
In O
|
     | O
the O
eyes O
alone O
could O
be O
discerned O
the O
peculiar O
and O
terrible O
glimmer O
which O
distinguished O
his O
own O
|
     | O
glances O
. O
| 
  | O
After O
regarding O
the O
portrait O
for O
some O
time O
fixedly O
, O
he O
thus O
addressed O
it O
: O

  | O
“ O
Dost O
hear O
me O
, O
old O

he O
cried O

Listen O
to O

Methought B-PERSON
Satan O
appeared O
to O
me O
in O
a O
dream O
last O

bade O

me O

hither O

and O
I O
should O
find O
what O
I O
sought O

The O
conditions O
he O
proposed O
were O
, O
that O
I O
should O

     | O
either O
give O

thy O

” O
| 
  | O
After O
a O
pause O
, O
he O
struck O
the O
portrait O
with O
his O
clenched O
hand O
, O
exclaiming O
in O
a O
loud O
voice O
: O

“ O

” O
| 
  | O
And O
he O
repeated O
the O
blow O
with O
greater O
violence O
. O

  | O
Disturbed O
by O
the O
shock O
, O
the O
brass O
plate O
beneath O
the O

started O
from O
its O
place O
, O
and O
fell O

     | O
to O
the O
ground O

  | O
“ O
What O

cried O

gazing O
into O

“ O
Ha!—my O

” O
| 
  | O
And O
, O
snatching O
up O
the O
lantern O
, O
he O
discovered O
, O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
a O
little O
recess O
, O
about B-CARDINAL
two I-CARDINAL

     | O

deep O
, O
a O
stone O
, O
with O
an O
iron O
ring O
in O
the O
centre O
of O
it O
. O
Uttering O
a O
joyful O
cry O
, O
he O
seized O
the O

     | O
ring O
, O
and O
drew O
the O
stone O
forward O
without O
difficulty O
, O
disclosing O
an O
open O
space O
beyond O
it O

“ O

  O
“ O

Rosicrucian B-NORP

kept O
his O

well O
  O

the O
devil O
has O
helped O
me O

from O

now O

” O

  | O
With O
this O
he O
hastily O
quitted O
the O
room O

returned O
almost O
immediately O
with O
a O
mallet O

a O

     | O
lever O

a O

armed O
with O

the O

he O
crept O
through O
the O

This O

     | O
done O
, O
he O
found O
himself O
at O
the O
head O
of O
a O
stone O
staircase O

which O
he O
descended O
, O

came O
to O
the O

arched O
entrance O

a O

The O
door O

locked O

holding O
up O
the O

“ O

why O

the O

Old O

have O
foreseen O
what O

against O
the O

some O
force O

the O

a O
soft O

silvery O
light O
streamed O
forth O
, O
and O
, O
|
     | O
stepping O
forward O
, O
Rougemont B-ORG
found O
himself O
in O
a O
spacious O
vault O
, O
from O
the O
ceiling O
of O
which O
hung O
a O

     | O
large O
globe O
of O
crystal O
, O
containing O
in O
its O
heart O
a O
little O
flame O
, O
which O
diffused O
a O
radiance O
, O
|
     | O
gentle O
as O
that O
of O
the O
moon O
, O
around O
. O
This O
, O
then O
, O
was O
the O
ever O
- O
burning O
lamp O
of O
the O
Rosicrucians B-NORP
, O
|
     | O
and O
Rougemont O
gazed O
at O
it O
with O
astonishment O
. O
Two B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
and I-CARDINAL
fifty I-CARDINAL
years I-CARDINAL
had O
elapsed O
since O
that O
|
     | O
wondrous O
flame O
had O
been O
lighted O
, O
and O
yet O
it O
burnt O
on O
brightly O
as O
ever O
. O
Hooped O
round O
the O
globe O
|
     | O
was O
a O
serpent O
with O
its O
tail O
in O
its O
mouth O
— O
an O
emblem O
of O
eternity O
— O
wrought O
in O
purest O
gold O
  O
while O
|
     | O
above O
it O
were O
a O
pair O
of O
silver O
wings O
, O
in O
allusion O

Massive O

the O
more O

     | O
costly O
metal O

fashioned O
like O
twisted O

served O
as O
suspenders O
to O
the O
lamp O
. O
| 
  | O
But O
Rougemont B-ORG
’s O
astonishment O
at O
this O
marvel O
quickly O
gave O
way O
to O
other O
feelings O
, O
and O
he O
gazed O
|
     | O
around O
the O
vault O
with O
greedy O
eyes O
. O
| 
  | O
It O
was O
a O
septilateral O
chamber O
, O
about B-QUANTITY
eight I-QUANTITY
feet I-QUANTITY
high O
, O
built O
of O
stone O

supported O
by O

     | O
beautifully O
groined O
arches O
. O
The O
surface O
of O
the O
masonry O
was O
as O
smooth O
and O
fresh O
as O
if O
the O
chisel O

     | O
had O
only O
just O
left O
it O

| 
  | O
In O
six B-CARDINAL

the O
corners O
were O
placed O
large O
chests O

ornamented O
with O
ironwork O

the O
most O

     | O
exquisite O
workmanship O

these O
Rougemont B-ORG

imagination O
pictured O

filled O
with O
inexhaustible O

     | O
treasure O
  O
while O
in O
the O
seventh B-ORDINAL
corner O
, O
near O
the O
door O
, O
was O
a O
beautiful O
little O
piece O
of O
|
     | O
monumental O
sculpture O
in O
white O
marble O
, O
representing O
two B-CARDINAL
kneeling O

hooded O
figures O
, O
holding O
a O

     | O
veil O
between O
them O
, O
which O
partly O
concealed O
the O
entrance O

a O
small O
recess O

On O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
chests O

     | O
opposite O
the O
monument O
just O
described O
stood O
a O
strangely O
- O
formed O
bottle O

a O
cup O
of O
antique O

     | O
workmanship O
, O
both O
encrusted O
with O
gems O

The O
walls O
were O
covered O
with O
circles O

squares O

in O
some O
places O

ornamented O
with O
grotesque O

In O
the O

was O
a O
round O
altar O

of O
black O

marble O

covered O
with O
a O
plate O

on O
which O
Rougemont B-ORG
read O
the O

“ O
Here O

then O

he O
cried O
. O
| 
  | O
And O
, O
prompted O
by O
some O
irresistible O
impulse O
, O
he O
seized O
the O
altar O
by O
the O
upper O
rim O
, O
and O
|
     | O
overthrew O
it O
. O
The O
heavy O
mass O
of O
marble O
fell O
with O
a O
thundering O
crash O
, O
breaking O
asunder O
the O
flag O
|
     | O
beneath O
it O
. O
It O
might O
be O
the O
reverberation O
of O
the O
vaulted O
roof O
, O
but O
a O
deep O
groan O
seemed O
to O

     | O
reproach O
the O
young O
man O
for O
his O
sacrilege O
. O
Undeterred O
, O
however O
, O
by O
this O
warning O
, O
Rougemont O

     | O
placed O
the O

between O
the O

and O
, O
exerting O
all O

     | O
his O
strength O
, O
speedily O
raised O
the O
fragments O
, O
and O
laid O
open O
the O
grave O
. O
| 
  | O
Within O
it O
, O
in O
the O
garb O
he O
wore O
in O
life O
, O
with O
his O
white O
beard O
streaming O
to O
his O
waist O
, O
lay O
the O

     | O
uncoffined O
body O
of O
his O
ancestor O
, O
Cyprian B-PERSON

The O
corpse O
had O
evidently O
been O
carefully O

     | O
embalmed O
, O
and O
the O

were O
unchanged O

Upon O
the O
breast O
, O
with O
the O

placed O
over O

     | O
possessing O
himself O

this O
mysterious O

volume O

Rougemont B-ORG
knelt O
upon O
the O
nearest O
chest O

     | O
and O
opened O
it O
. O
But O
he O
was O
disappointed O
in O
his O
expectation O
. O
All O
the O
pages O
he O
examined O
were O

     | O
filled O
with O
cabalistic O
characters O

which O
he O
was O
totally O
unable O
to O
decipher O

  | O
At O
length O
, O

he O
chanced O
upon O
one B-CARDINAL

the O

comprehended O

he O

     | O
remained O
for O
some O
time O
absorbed O
in O
its O
contemplation O
, O
while O
an O
almost O
fiendish O
smile O

upon O

“ O

The O

up O

a O

He O
then O
opened O
the O

upon O
the O

found O
its O
contents O
accorded O

with O
what O

told O
him O

Placing O

into O
the O

, O
casting O
his O

about O

remarked O
the O

Auriol B-PERSON
paused O
not O
to O

examine O

seizing O
the O
cup O
with O
desperation O
, O
he O
placed O
it O
to O
his O
lips O

emptied O

draught O

species O
of O
intoxication O
, O

pleasing O
as O
that O
produced O
by O

presently O
succeeded O

All O

     | O
his O
fears O
left O
him O
, O

in O
their O
place O
the O
gentlest O

arose O

     | O
Surrendering O
himself O
delightedly O
to O
their O
influence O
, O
he O
sank O
upon O
a O
couch O
, O
and O
for O
some O
time O
|
     | O
was O
wrapped O
in O
a O
dreamy O
elysium O
, O
imagining O
himself O
wandering O
with O
Edith B-PERSON
Talbot I-PERSON
in O
a O
lovely O

     | O
garden O

redolent O
of O
sweets O
, O
and O
vocal O
with O
the O
melody O
of O
birds O

Their O
path O
led O
through O
a O
grove O
, O
|
     | O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
which O
was O
a O
fountain O
  O
and O
they O
were O
hastening O
towards O
its O
marble O
brink O
, O
when O
|
     | O
all O
at O
once O
Edith B-ORG
uttered O
a O
scream O
, O
and O
, O
starting O
back O
, O
pointed O
to O
a O
large O
black O
snake O
lying O
|
     | O
before O
her O
, O
and O
upon O
which O
she O
would O
have O
trodden O
the O
next O
moment O
. O
Auriol O
sprang O
forward O
and O
|
     | O
tried O
to O
crush O
the O
reptile O
with O
his O
heel O
  O
but O
, O
avoiding O
the O
blow O
, O
it O
coiled O
around O
his O
leg O
, O
and O
|
     | O
plunged O
its O
venom O
teeth O
into O
his O
flesh O
. O
The O
anguish O
occasioned O
by O
the O
imaginary O
wound O
roused O
|
     | O
him O
from O
his O
slumber O
, O
and O
looking O
up O
, O
he O
perceived O
that O
a O
servant O
was O
in O
attendance O
. O
| 
  | O
Bowing O
obsequiously O
, O
the O
man O
inquired O
whether O
he O
had O
occasion O
for O
anything O
. O

  | O
“ O
Show O
me O
to O
my O
bedroom O
— O
that O
is O
all O
I O
require O

replied O
Auriol B-PERSON
, O
scarcely O
able O
to O
shake O
off O
the O

     | O
effect O
of O
the O
vision O
. O

  | O
And O
, O
getting O
up O
, O
he O
followed O
the O
man O

almost O
mechanically O

out O

on O
the B-TIME

At O
first B-ORDINAL

finding O
himself O
in O
a O
large O

     | O
and O
most O
luxuriantly O
- O
furnished O
chamber O
, O
he O
was O
at O
a O
loss O
to O
conceive O
how O
he O
came O
there O
, O
and O
it O

     | O
was O
some O
time O
before O
he O
could O
fully O
recall O
the O
mysterious O
events O
of O
the B-TIME
previous I-TIME
night I-TIME

As O
had O

     | O
been O
foretold O
, O
however O
, O
by O
Rougemont B-ORG
, O
his O
position O
did O
not O
cause O
him O
so O
much O
anxiety O
as O
|
     | O
before O
. O
| 
  | O
After O
attiring O
himself O
, O
he O
descended O
to O
the O
lower O
apartments O

in O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
which O
a O
sumptuous O

     | O
breakfast O
awaited O
him O
  O
and O
having O
partaken O
of O
it O
, O
he O
took O
a O
complete O
survey O
of O
the O
house O
, O
and O
|
     | O
found O
it O
larger O
and O
more O
magnificent O
even O
than O
he O
had O
supposed O
it O
. O
He O
next O
supplied O
himself O

     | O
from O
the O
pocket O
- O
book O
with O
a O
certain O
sum O
, O
for O
which O
he O
fancied O

might O
have O
occasion O
in O
the O

of O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE

sallied O
forth O

His O
first B-ORDINAL

was O
to O
procure O
a O
splendid O

     | O
horses O

and O
to O

at O
the O
upper O

     | O

His O
heart O
beat O
violently O
as O
he O
was O
shown O
into O
an O
elegant O
drawing O
- O
room O
, O
and O
|
     | O
his O
trepidation O
momentarily O
increased O
, O
until O
the O
servant O
reappeared O
and O
expressed O
his O
regret O

     | O
that O
he O
had O
misinformed O
him O

     | O
remark O

departed O

he O
wrote O
a O

announcing O

     | O
Transported O
by O

Auriol B-PERSON
half O
devoured O
the O

     | O
instantly O
sent O
off O
his O

father O
— O
merely O
adding O
a O

His O

possessed O
none O

so O
captivated O

eye O
upon O

     | O
Auriol B-PERSON
’s O
attentions O
to O
his O

from O
a O
notion O
that O

be O
very O

     | O
undesirable O
in O

Edith B-PERSON
Talbot I-PERSON
was O
a O
lovely O
brunette O
. O
Her O
features O
were O
regular O
, O
and O
her O
eyes O
, O
which O
were O
|
     | O
perfectly O
splendid O
, O
were O
dark O
, O
almond O
- O
shaped O
, O
and O
of O
almost O
Oriental B-NORP
languor O
. O
Her O
hair O
, O
which O

     | O
she O

braided O
over O
her O

and O
gathered O
behind O

a O
massive O
roll O
, O
was O
black O
and O
glossy O
as O
a O

     | O
raven O

. O
Her O
cheeks O
were O
dimpled O
, O
her O
lips O
of O
velvet O
softness O
, O
and O
her O
teeth O
like O
ranges O

     | O
of O
pearls O
. O
Perfect O
grace O
accompanied O
all O
her O
movements O
, O
and O
one B-CARDINAL
only O
wondered O
that O
feet O
so O
|
     | O
small O
as O
those O
she O
possessed O
should O
have O
the O
power O
of O
sustaining O
a O
form O
which O
, O
though O
|
     | O
lightsome O
, O
was O
yet O
rounded O
in O
its O
proportions O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
You O

heard O

to O
our O

said O
Auriol B-PERSON
, O
after O

     | O
gazing O
at O
her O
for O
a O
few O
moments O
in O
silent O
admiration O
. O
| 
  | O
Edith B-PERSON
murmured O
an O
affirmative O
, O
and O
blushed O
deeply O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
He O
has O
fixed O
Wednesday B-DATE
next O
, O
” O
pursued O
Auriol B-PERSON
  O
“ O
but O
I O
wish O
an O
earlier O
day O
could O
have O
been O

     | O
named O
. O
I O
have O
a O
presentiment O
that O
if O
our O
marriage O
is O
so O
long O
delayed O
, O
it O
will O
not O
take O
place O

all O

“ O
You O

she O
replied O
. O

  | O
“ O
I O
confess O
it O
, O
” O
he O
said O
  O
“ O
and O
my O
apprehensions O
have O
risen O
to O
such O
a O
point O
, O
that O
I O
feel O

     | O
disposed O
to O
urge O
you O
to O
a O
private O
marriage O
, O
during O
your O
father O

“ O
Oh O
no O
, O
Auriol B-PERSON
  O
much O
as O
I O
love O
you O
, O
I O
could O
never O
consent O
to O
such O
a O
step O

she O
cried O
. O
“ O
You O

     | O
can O
not O
urge O
me O
to O
it O

I O
would O
not O
abuse O
my O

I O
have O
never O

that O

Further O
conversation O
was O
interrupted O
by O
the O
entrance O
of O
Mr. O

held O
out O
both O
his O

professed O
the O

And O
no O

he O
was O
sincere O

The O

passed O
off O
most O
pleasantly O

  O

was O
communicated O

the O

When O
Auriol B-PERSON

     | O
went O
up O

This O

always O

a O
partiality O
for O
Auriol B-PERSON

     | O
had O
encouraged O
his O

was O
well O

near O

Mr. O

fruitlessly O
, O
to O
give O
him O
a O
hint O

told O
him O

     | O

depend O

him O
back O
on O
the B-TIME

“ O
But O
why O
do O
you O
particularise O
him O

“ O
Are O
you O
prepared O
to O
quit O
this O
gay O
scene O

” O
he O
asked O
, O
with O
a O
heart O
swelling O

     | O
with O
rapture O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
Quite O
so O
, O
” O
she O
replied O
, O
gazing O
at O
him O
with O
tenderness O
  O
“ O
I O
long O
to O
be O
alone O
with O
you O

” O

  | O
“ O
Come O
, O
then O
, O
” O
said O
Auriol B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
Edith B-ORG
arose O
, O
and O
passing O
her O
arm O
under O
that O
of O
her O
husband O
, O
they O
quitted O
the O
ball O
- O
room O
, O
but O
|
     | O
in O
place O
of O
descending O
the O
principal O
staircase O
, O
they O
took O
a O
more O
private O
course O
. O
The O
hall O
, O
|
     | O
which O
they O
were O
obliged O
to O
cross O
, O
and O
which O
they O
entered O
from O
a O
side O
- O
door O
, O
was O
spacious O
and O
|
     | O
beautifully O
proportioned O
, O
and O
adorned O
with O
numerous O
statues O
on O
pedestals O
. O
The O
ceiling O
was O
|
     | O
decorated O
with O
fresco O
paintings O
, O
and O
supported O
by O
two B-CARDINAL
stately O
scagliola B-GPE
pillars O
. O
From O
between O
|
     | O
these O
, O
a O
broad O
staircase O
of O
white O
marble O
ascended O
to O
the O
upper O
room O
. O
As O
Auriol B-PERSON
had O
foreseen O
, O
|
     | O
the O
staircase O
was O
thronged O
with O
guests O
ascending O
to O
the O
ball O
- O
room O
, O
the O
doors O
of O
which O
being O
|
     | O
open O
, O
afforded O
glimpses O
of O
the O
dancers O
, O
and O
gave O
forth O
strains O
of O
liveliest O
music O
. O
Anxious O
to O
|
     | O
avoid O
a O
newly O
- O
arrived O
party O
in O
the O
hall O
, O
Auriol B-PERSON
and O
his O
bride O
lingered O
for O
a O
moment O
near O
a O
|
     | O
pillar O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
Ha O
! O
who O
is O
this O
? O
” O
cried O
Edith B-ORG
, O
as O
a O
tall O
man O
, O
with O
a O
sinister O
countenance O
, O
and O
habited O
|
     | O
entirely O
in O
black O
, O
moved O
from O
the O
farther O
side O
of O
the O
pillar O
, O
and O
planted O
himself O
in O
their O
|
     | O
path O
, O
with O
his O
back O
partly O
towards O
them O
. O
| 
  | O
A O
thrill O
of O
apprehension O
passed O
through O
Auriol B-PERSON
’s O
frame O
. O
He O
looked O
up O
and O
beheld O
Rougemont B-ORG
, O
|
     | O
who O
, O
glancing O
over O
his O
shoulder O
, O
fixed O
his O
malignant O
gaze O
upon O
him O
. O
Retreat O
was O
now O
|
     | O
impossible O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
You O
thought O
to O
delude O
me O
, O
” O
said O
Rougemont B-ORG
, O
in O
a O
deep O
whisper O
, O
audible O
only O
to O
Auriol B-PERSON
  O
“ O
but O
|
     | O
you O
counted O
without O
your O
host O

I O
am O
come O
to O
claim O
my O
victim O
. O
” O
| 
  | O
“ O
What O
is O
the O
matter O
with O
you O
, O
that O
you O
tremble O
so O
, O
dear O
Auriol B-PERSON
? O
” O
cried O
Edith B-PERSON
. O
“ O
Who O
is O
this O
|
     | O
strange O
person O
? O
” O
| 
  | O
But O
her O
husband O
returned O
no O
answer O
. O
Terror O
had O
taken O
away O
his O
power O
of O
utterance O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
Your O
carriage O
waits O
for O
you O
at O
the O
door O
, O
madam O
— O
all O
is O
prepared O

” O
said O
Rougemont B-ORG
, O
advancing O
|
     | O
towards O
her O
, O
and O
taking O
her O
hand O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
You O
are O
coming O
, O
Auriol B-PERSON
? O
” O
cried O
Edith B-PERSON
, O
who O
scarcely O
knew O
whether O
to O
draw O
back O
or O
go O
|
     | O
forward O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
Yes O
— O
yes O
, O
” O
cried O
Auriol B-PERSON
, O
who O
fancied O
he O
saw O
a O
means O
of O
escape O
. O
“ O
This O
is O
my O
friend O

Mr. O

with O
him O

” O
| 
  | O
“ O
Mr. O
Rougemont B-PERSON
! O
” O
cried O
Edith B-PERSON
. O
“ O
You O
told O
my O
father O
he O
would O
not O
be O
here O

  | O
“ O
Your O
husband O
did O
not O
invite O
me O
, O
madam O

” O
said O
Rougemont B-ORG
, O
with O
sarcastic O
emphasis O
  O
“ O
but O
|
     | O
knowing O
I O
should O
be O
welcome O

I O
came O
unasked O

But O
let O
us O
avoid O
those O
persons O

” O
| 
  | O
In O
another O
moment O
they O
were O
at O
the O
door O
. O
The O
carriage O
was O
there O
with O
its O
four B-CARDINAL
horses O
, O
and O
a O
|
     | O
man O
- O
servant O
, O
in O
travelling O
attire O
, O
stood O
beside O
the O
steps O
. O
Reassured O
by O
the O
sight O
, O
Auriol B-PERSON
|
     | O
recovered O
his O
courage O
, O
and O
suffered O
Rougemont O
to O
throw O
a O
cloak O
over O
Edith B-ORG
’s O
shoulders O
. O
The O
next O
|
     | O
moment O
she O
tripped O
up O
the O
steps O
of O
the O
carriage O
, O
and O
was O
ensconced O
within O
it O
. O
Auriol B-PERSON
was O
about O
|
     | O
to O
follow O
her O
, O
when O
he O
received O
a O
violent O
blow O
on O
the O
chest O
, O
which O
stretched O
him O
on O
the O
|
     | O
pavement O
. O
Before O
he O
could O
regain O
his O
feet O
, O
Rougemont B-ORG
had O
sprung O
into O
the O
carriage O
. O
The O
steps O
|
     | O
were O
instantly O
put O
up O
by O
the O
man O
- O
servant O
, O
who O
mounted O
the O
box O
with O
the O
utmost O
celerity O
, O
while O
|
     | O
the O
postillions O
, O
plunging O
spurs O
into O
their O
horses O
, O
dashed O
off O
with O
lightning O
speed O
. O
As O
the O

     | O
carriage O
turned O
the O
corner O
of O
King B-FAC
Street I-FAC
, O
Auriol B-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
just O
arisen O

beheld O
, O
by O
the O
light O
of O

     | O
a O
lamp O
, O
Rougemont B-ORG
’s O
face O
at O
the O
window O
of O
the O
carriage O
, O
charged O
with O
an O
expression O
of O
the O
most O

     | O
fiendish O
triumph O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
What O
is O
the O
matter O
? O
” O
cried O
Mr. O
Talbot B-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
approached O
Auriol B-PERSON
, O
“ O
I O
came O
to O

you O

“ O

I O

sold O
her O

replied O
Auriol B-PERSON
gloomily O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
What O
mean O
you O
, O
wretch O
? O
” O
cried O
Mr. O
Talbot B-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
voice O
of O
distraction O
. O
“ O
I O
heard O
that O
Cyprian B-PERSON

Rougemont I-PERSON
was O
here O

Can O
it O
be O
he O
that O
has O
gone O
off O
with O
her O
? O
” O
| 
  | O
“ O
You O
have O
hit O
the O
truth O
, O
” O
replied O
Auriol B-WORK_OF_ART

“ O
He O
bought O
her O

the O
money O
I O
gave O

I O

     | O
sold O
her O

myself O
to O
perdition O

” O
| 
  | O
“ O
Horror O
! O
” O
exclaimed O
the O
old O
man O
, O
falling O
backwards O
. O

“ O
Ay O

breathe O
your O

breathe O

Auriol B-PERSON
wildly O

“ O
Would O

up O
my O

And O
he O

Mr. O
Thorneycroft B-PERSON
and O
his O
companions O
had O
scarcely O
gained O
a O
passage O
in O
the O
deserted O
house O
, O
|
     | O
which O
they O
had O
entered O
in O
the O
manner O
described O
in O
a O
previous O
chapter O
, O
when O
they O
were O
alarmed O
by O
|
     | O
the O
sudden O
and O
furious O
ringing O
of O
a O
bell O
overhead O
. O
The O
noise O
brought O
them O
instantly O
to O
a O
halt O
, O

     | O
and O
each O
man O
grasped O
his O
arms O
in O
expectation O

an O

the O

ceasing O
in O
a O
few O

all O
continuing O
quiet O

they O
moved O
on O
as O
before O

and O
presently O
reached O
a O
large O
hall O

     | O
with O
a O
lofty O
window O
over O
the O
door O

which O
, O
being O
without O

afforded O
light O
enough O
to O

     | O
reveal O
the O
dilapidated O

of O
the O
mansion O

From O
this O

four B-CARDINAL

recently O

for O
a O
lamp O

The O
walls O

panelled O

dusky B-PERSON

hung O
at O
the O

Mr. O

     | O
pierced O
with O
a O

the O

     | O
after O

sufficiently O
explained O
it O

him O

“ O
A O
singular O

he O
observed O
to O

“ O

“ O

“ O

asked O
Thorneycroft B-PERSON
with O
increasing O
trepidation O
. O

  | O
“ O
That O

impossible O

answered O

  O
“ O
but O
I O
warn O
you O

“ O
Make O

have O
no O

sternly O
. O

  | O
“ O
Oh O

  | O
“ O
Yes O

ve’ll O

added O
the O
Tinker B-ORG

the O
Sandman B-PRODUCT
. O

  | O
“ O
You O
may O
depend O

said O

. O
“ O
Before O

” O
| 
  | O
But O
without O
paying O
any O
attention O
to O
the O
inquiry O
, O
Reeks B-GPE
quitted O
the O
room O
, O
and O
closed O
the O
door O
|
     | O
carefully O
after O
him O
. O
He O
next O
crossed O
the O
hall O
, O
and O
cautiously O
ascending O
a O
staircase O
at O
the O
|
     | O
farther O
end O
of O
it O
, O
reached O
the O
landing O
- O
place O
. O
Beyond O
it O
was O
a O
gallery O
, O
from O
which O
several O
|
     | O
chambers O
opened O
. O
| 
  | O
Advancing O
a O
few O
paces O
, O
he O
listened O
intently O
, O
and O
hearing O
a O
slight O
sound O
in O
an O
apartment O
to O
|
     | O
the O
right O
, O
he O
stepped O
softly O
towards O
it O
, O
and O
placing O
his O
eye O
to O
the O
keyhole O
, O
beheld O
a O
tall O
man O
, O
|
     | O
dressed O
in O
black O
, O
pacing O
to O
and O
fro O
with O
rapid O
strides O
, O
while O
three B-CARDINAL
other O
persons O
, O
wrapped O
in O
|
     | O
sable O
gowns O
, O
and O
disguised O
with O
hideous O
masks O
, O
stood O
silent O
and O
motionless O
at O
a O
little O
distance O
|
     | O
from O
him O
. O
In O
the O
tall O
man O
he O
recognised O
Cyprian B-ORG
Rougemont I-ORG
. O
Upon O
a O
table O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
|
     | O
room O
was O
laid O
a O
large O
open O
volume O
, O
bound O
in O
black O
vellum O
. O
Near O
it O
stood O
a O
lamp O
, O
which O
served O
to O
|
     | O
illumine O
the O
scene O
. O
| 
  | O
Suddenly O
, O
Rougemont B-ORG
stopped O
, O
and O
turning O
over O
several O
leaves O
of O
the O
book O
, O
which O
were O
covered O
|
     | O
with O
cabalistic O
characters O
, O
appeared O
in O
search O
of O
some O
magic O
formula O
. O
Before O
he O
could O
find O
it O
, O
|
     | O
however O
, O
a O
startling O
interruption O
occurred O
. O
An O
alarum O
- O
bell O
, O
fixed O
against O
the O
wall O
, O
began O
to O
|
     | O
ring O
, O
and O
at O
the O
same O
moment O
the O
doors O
of O
a O
cabinet O
flew O
open O
, O
and O
a O
large O
ape O
( O
for O
such O
it O
|
     | O
seemed O
to O
Reeks B-GPE
) O
, O
clothed O
in O
a O
woollen O
shirt O
and O
drawers O
, O
sprang O
forth O
, O
and O
bounding O
upon O
the O
|
     | O
table O
beside O
Rougemont B-GPE
, O
placed O
its O
mouth O
to O
his O
ear O
. O
The O
communication O
thus O
strangely O
made O
|
     | O
seemed O
highly O
displeasing O
to O
Rougemont B-GPE
, O
who O
knitted O
his O
brows O
, O
and O
delivered O
some O
instructions O
|
     | O
in O
an O
undertone O
to O
the O
monkey O
. O
The O
animal O
nodded O
its O
head O
in O
token O
of O
obedience O
, O
jumped O
off O
the O
|
     | O
table O
, O
and O
bounded O
back O
to O
the O
cabinet O
, O
the O
doors O
of O
which O
closed O
as O
before O
. O
Rougemont O
next O
|
     | O
took O
up O
the O
lamp O
, O
with O
the O
evident O
intention O
of O
quitting O
the O
room O
, O
seeing O
which O
, O
Reeks B-NORP
hastily O
|
     | O
retreated O
to O
an O
adjoining O
chamber O
, O
the O
door O
of O
which O
was O
fortunately O
open O
, O
and O
had O
scarcely O
|
     | O
gained O
its O
shelter O
when O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
mysterious O
personages O
appeared O
on O
the O
gallery O
. O
Reeks O
heard O
|
     | O
their O
footsteps O
descending O
the O
staircase O
, O
and O
then O
, O
creeping O
cautiously O
after O
them O
, O
watched O
|
     | O
them O
across O
the O
hall O
, O
and O
pause O
before O
the O
chamber O
containing O
Mr. O
Thorneycroft B-PERSON
and O
his O
|
     | O
companions O
. O
After O
a O
moment O
’s O
deliberation O
, O
Rougemont B-ORG
noiselessly O
locked O
the O
door O
, O
took O
out O
the O
|
     | O
key O
, O
and O
leaving O
two B-CARDINAL
of O
his O
attendants O
on O
guard O
, O
returned O
with O
the O
third B-ORDINAL
towards O
the O
|
     | O
staircase O
. O
| 
  | O
Without O
tarrying O
to O
confront O
them O
, O
Reeks B-GPE
started O
back O
, O
and O
hurried O
along O
the O
gallery O
till O
he O
|
     | O
came O
to O
a O
back O
staircase O
, O
which O
conducted O
him O
, O
by O
various O
descents O
, O
to O
the O
basement O
floor O
, O
|
     | O
where O
, O
after O
traversing O
one B-CARDINAL
or O
two B-CARDINAL
vaults O
, O
he O
entered O
a O
subterranean O
passage O
, O
arched O
overhead O
, O
|
     | O
and O
having O
several O
openings O
at O
the O
sides O
, O
apparently O
communicating O
with O
other O
passages O
. O
It O
was O
|
     | O
lighted O
at O
intervals O
by O
lamps O
, O
which O
emitted O
a O
feeble O
radiance O
. O
| 
  | O
By O
the O
light O
of O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
these O
, O
Reeks B-GPE
discovered O
the O
door O
of O
a O
cell O
. O
It O
was O
of O
iron O
, O
and O
as O
he O
|
     | O
struck O
it O
with O
his O
hand O
, O
returned O
a O
hollow O
clangour O
. O
On O
repeating O
the O
blow O
, O
a O
hoarse O
voice O
from O
|
     | O
within O
cried O
, O
“ O

” O
| 
  | O
“ O
Is O

” O
demanded O

  | O
“ O

replied O
the O

“ O

” O

“ O

“ O

“ O

Mr. O
Thorneycroft B-PERSON
, O
turning O
pale O
, O
and O
trembling O
. O
“ O
It O
sounds O
as O
if O

     | O
some O
hidden O
machinery O
were O
at O
work O
. O
” O
| 
  | O
The O
noise O
, O
which O
up O
to O
this O
moment O
had O
borne O
an O
indistinct O
resemblance O
to O
the O
creaking O
of O
|
     | O
wheels O
and O
pulleys O
, O
now O
increased O
to O
a O
violent O
clatter O
, O
while O
the O
house O
was O
shaken O
as O
if O
by O
the O
|
     | O
explosion O
of O
a O
mine O
beneath O
it O
. O
| 
  | O
At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
the O
occupants O
of O
the O
chairs O
received O
a O
sharp O
electrical O
shock O
, O
that O
|
     | O
agitated O
every O
limb O
, O
and O
caused O
Mr. O
Thorneycroft B-PERSON
to O
let O
fall O
his O
pistol O
, O
which O
went O
off O
as O
it O
|
     | O
reached O
the O
ground O
. O
At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
the O
Sandman B-ORG
dropped O
his O
goblet O
, O
and O
the O
Tinker B-ORG
|
     | O
relinquished O
his O
grasp O
of O
the O
cutlass O
. O
Before O
they O
could O
recover O
from O
the O
shock O
, O
all O
three B-CARDINAL
were O
|
     | O
caught O
by O
stout O
wooden O
hooks O
, O
which O
, O
detaching O
themselves O
from O
the O
back O
of O
the O
chairs O
, O
pinioned O
|
     | O
their O
arms O
, O
while O
their O
legs O
were O
restrained O
by O
fetters O
, O
which O
sprang O
from O
the O
ground O
and O
|
     | O
clasped O
round O
their O
ankles O
. O
Thus O
fixed O
, O
they O
struggled O
vainly O
to O
get O
free O
. O
The O
chairs O
seemed O
|
     | O
nailed O
to O
the O
ground O
, O
so O
that O
all O
efforts O
to O
move O
them O
proved O
futile O
. O
| 
  | O
But O
the O
worst O
was O
to O
come O
. O
From O
the O
holes O
in O
the O
ceiling O
already O
alluded O
to O
, O
descended O
three B-CARDINAL
|
     | O
heavy O
bell O
- O
shaped O
helmets O
, O
fashioned O
like O
those O
worn O
by O
divers O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
sea O
, O
and O
|
     | O
having O
round O
eyelet O
- O
holes O
of O
glass O
. O
It O
was O
evident O
, O
from O
the O
manner O
of O
their O
descent O
, O
that O
|
     | O
these O
helmets O
must O
drop O
on O
the O
heads O
of O
the O
sitters O
— O
a O
conviction O
that O
filled O
them O
with O
|
     | O
inexpressible O
terror O
. O
They O
shouted O
, O
and O
swore O
frightfully O
  O
but O
their O
vociferations O
availed O
them O
|
     | O
nothing O
. O
Down O
came O
the O
helmets O
, O
and O
the O
same O
moment O
the O
monkey O
, O
which O
had O
been O
seen O
by O
Reeks B-GPE
, O
|
     | O
issued O
from O
a O
cupboard O
at O
the O
top O
of O
a O
cabinet O
, O
and O
grinned O
and O
gibbered O
at O
them O
. O
| 
  | O
Down O
came O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
helmet O
, O
and O
covered O
the O
Tinker B-ORG
to O
the O
shoulders O
. O
His O
appearance O
was O
at O
|
     | O
once O
ludicrous O
and O
terrible O
, O
and O
his O
roaring O
within O
the O
casque O
sounded O
like O
the O
bellowing O
of O
a O
|
     | O
baited O
bull O
. O
| 
  | O
Down O
came O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
helmet O
, O
though O
rather O
more O
slowly O
, O
and O
the O
Sandman B-ORG
was O
eclipsed O
in O
the O
|
     | O
same O
manner O
as O
the O
Tinker B-ORG
, O
and O
roared O
as O
loudly O
. O
| 
  | O
In O
both O
these O
instances O
the O
helmets O
had O
dropped O
without O
guidance O
, O
but O
in O
the O
case O
of O
Mr. O
|
     | O
Thorneycroft B-PERSON
, O
a O
hand O
, O
thrust O
out O
of O
the O
hole O
in O
the O
ceiling O
, O
held O
the O
helmet O
suspended O
over O
his O
|
     | O
head O
, O
like O
the O
sword O
of O
Damocles B-GPE
. O
While O
the O
poor O
iron O
- O
merchant O
momentarily O
expected O
the O
same O
|
     | O
doom O
as O
his O
companions O
, O
his O
attention O
was O
attracted O
towards O
the O
monkey O
, O
which O
, O
clinging O
with O
|
     | O
one O
hand O
to O
the O
side O
of O
the O
cabinet O
, O
extended O
the O
other O
skinny O
arm O
towards O
him O
, O
and O
|
     | O
exclaimed—“Will O
you O
swear O
to O
go O
hence O
if O
you O
are O
spared O
? O
” O
| 
  | O
“ O
No O
, O
I O
will O
not O
, O
” O
replied O
the O
iron O
- O
merchant O
. O
He O
had O
scarcely O
spoken O
, O
when O
the O
helmet O
fell O
|
     | O
with O
a O
jerk O
, O
and O
extinguished O
him O
like O
the O
others O
. O
| 
  | O
Ginger O
alone O
remained O
. O
During O
the O
whole O
of O
this O
strange O
scene O
, O
he O
had O
stood O
with O
the O
bottle O
|
     | O
in O
hand O
, O
transfixed O
with O
terror O
and O
astonishment O
, O
and O
wholly O
unable O
to O
move O
or O
cry O
out O
. O
A O
|
     | O
climax O
was O
put O
to O
his O
fright O
, O
by O
the O
descent O
of O
the O
three B-CARDINAL
chairs O
, O
with O
their O
occupants O
, O
through O
|
     | O
the O
floor O
into O
a O
vault O
beneath O
  O
and O
as O
the O
helmets O
were O
whisked O
up O
again O
to O
the O
ceiling O
, O
and O
|
     | O
the O
trap O
- O
doors O
closed O
upon O
the O
chairs O
, O
he O
dropped O
the O
bottle O
, O
and O
fell O
with O
his O
face O
upon O
the O
|
     | O
table O
. O
He O
was O
, O
however O
, O
soon O
roused O
by O
a O
pull O
at O
his O
hair O
, O
while O
a O
shrill O
voice O
called O
him O
by O
|
     | O
his O
name O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
Who O
is O
it O
? O
” O
groaned O
the O
dog O
- O
fancier O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
Look O
up O
! O
” O
cried O
the O
speaker O
, O
again O

, O
stretching O
out O
his O

the O

slowly O

A O
few O
steps O

Touching O
the O

gone O
from O
his O

in O
its O

of O
a O

coming O
up O
at O
the O
moment O

he O
discharged O

with O
a O
deliberate O
aim O

at O
the O
breast O
of O

uninjured O

  | O
“ O
You O

how O

backwards O

The O

Mr. O

“ O
Come O

come O
on O

close O
behind O

us O

” O
| 
  | O
And O
it O
was O
evident O
, O
from O
the O
increased O
clamour O
, O
that O
their O
pursuers O
were O
upon O
them O
. O

  | O
Roused O
by O
the O
imminence O
of O
the O
danger O
, O
and O
by O
the O
hope O
of O
rescuing O
his O
daughter O
, O
Mr. O

     | O
Thorneycroft B-PERSON
exerted O
all O
his O
energies O
, O
and O
sprang O
forward O
. O
A O
little O
farther O
on O
, O
they O
were O

     | O
stopped O
by O
a O
door O
. O
It O
was O
closed O
  O
and O
venting O
his O
disappointment O
in O
a O
scream O
, O
the O
dwarf O
|
     | O
searched O
for O
the O
handle O
, O
but O
could O
not O
find O
it O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
We O
are O
entrapped O
— O
we O
shall O
be O
caught O
, O
” O
he O
cried O
, O
“ O
and O
then O
woe O
to O
both O
of O
us O

Fool O
that O
I O
was O

     | O
to O

Better O
I O

left O
you O

rot O
in O
a O
dungeon O

incurred O

     | O
Rougemont B-ORG
’s O
displeasure O

” O
| 
  | O
The O
iron O
- O
merchant O
replied O
by O
a O
groan O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
It O
’s O
all O
over O
with O
me O
, O
” O
he O
said O
. O
“ O
I O
give O
it O
up O
— O
I’ll O
die O
here O
! O
” O
| 
  | O
“ O
No O
— O
we O
are O
saved O
, O
” O
cried O
the O
dwarf O
, O
as O
the O
light O
, O
now O
flashing O
strongly O
upon O
the O
door O
, O
|
     | O
revealed O
a O
small O
iron O
button O
within O
it,—“saved O
— O
saved O
! O
” O
| 
  | O
As O
he O
spoke O
, O
he O
pressed O
against O
the O
button O
, O
which O
moved O
a O
spring O
, O
and O
the O
door O
flew O
open O
. O

     | O
Just O
as O
they O
passed O
through O
it O
, O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
masked O
attendants O
came O
in O
sight O
. O
The O
dwarf O
instantly O
|
     | O
shut O
the O
door O
, O
and O
finding O
a O
bolt O
on O
the O
side O
next O
him O
, O
shot O
it O
into O
the O
socket O
. O
Scarcely O
had O
|
     | O
he O
accomplished O
this O
, O
when O
the O
pursuers O
came O
up O
, O
and O
dashed O
themselves O
against O
the O
door O
  O
but O
|
     | O
finding O
it O
bolted O
, O
presently O
ceased O
their O
efforts O
, O
and O
apparently O
withdrew O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
They O
are O
gone O
by O
some O
other O
way O
to O

” O
cried O
Old O
Parr B-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
paused O
for O
a O
|
     | O
moment O
to O
listen O
  O
“ O
come O
on O
, O
Mr. O
Thorneycroft B-PERSON
. O
” O
| 
  | O
“ O
I O
’ll O
try O
, O
” O
replied O
the O
iron O
- O
merchant O
, O
with O
a O
subdued O
groan O
, O
“ O
but O
I O
’m O
completely O
spent O

Oh O

     | O
that O
I O
ever O
ventured O
into O
this O
place O

” O

  | O
“ O
It O
’s O
too O
late O

now O

you O
came O
here O
to O
rescue O
your O

     | O
rejoined O
Old O
Parr B-PERSON
. O
“ O
Take O
care O
and O
keep O
near O
me O
. O
I O
wonder O
where O
this O
passage O
leads O
to O
? O
” O
| 
  | O
“ O
Do O
n’t O
you O
know O
? O
” O
inquired O
the O
iron O
- O
merchant O
. O

  | O
“ O
Not O
in O
the O
least O
, O
” O
returned O
the O
dwarf O
. O
“ O
This O
is O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O

’ve O
been O
here O

it O
shall O

     | O
be O
the O

“ O
You O
have O
n’t O
told O
me O
how O
you O
came O
here O
at O
all O

observed O
Thorneycroft B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
I O
hardly O
know O
myself O
, O
” O
replied O
the O
dwarf O
  O
“ O
but O
I O
find O
it O
more O
difficult O
to O
get O
out O
than O
I O

     | O
did O
to O
get O
in O
. O
How O
this O
passage O
twists O
about O
! O
I O
declare O
we O
seem O
to O
be O
returning O
to O
the O
point O

     | O
started O
from O

” O
| 
  | O
“ O
I O
think O
we O
are O
turning O
round O
ourselves O
, O
” O
cried O
Thorneycroft B-PERSON
, O
in O
an O
agony O
of O
fright O
. O
“ O
My O
head O

     | O
is O
going O

Oh O
dear O
! O
oh O
dear O

” O
| 
  | O
“ O
Why O
, O
it O
does O
seem O
very O
strange O
, O
I O
must O
say O
, O
” O
remarked O
the O
dwarf O
, O
coming O
to O
a O
halt O
. O
“ O
I O
could O
|
     | O
almost O
fancy O
that O
the O
solid O
stone O
walls O

moving O
around O
us O

” O

  | O
“ O
They O

moving O

cried O
Thorneycroft B-PERSON

stretching O
out O
his O
hand O

“ O
I O

Evil O

” O

  | O
“ O
The O

seems O
on O
fire O
, O
” O
cried O
the O
dwarf O
. O
“ O
A O
thick O
smoke O
fills O
the O
passage O

Do O

you O

“ O
Do O

” O
cried O
the O
iron O
- O
merchant O
, O
coughing O
and O
sneezing O
. O
“ O
I O
feel O
as O

“ O
Do O

cried O
the O
dwarf O

who O
seemed O
quite O
at O
his O
ease O
. O
“ O
We O

out O

  | O
“ O
I O

Mr. O

“ O

rejoined O
Old O
Parr B-PERSON
. O
“ O
Halloa O

     | O
how O

this O

“ O

the O
iron O

“ O
We O

what O
new O

     | O
difficulty O
has O
arisen O
? O
” O
| 
  | O
“ O
Merely O
that O
the O

blocked O
up O

that O

Old O

“ O
Blocked O

Thorneycroft B-PERSON

“ O
Then O

entombed O
alive O

” O

“ O

I O

the O

with O
affected O
nonchalance O

“ O

“ O
Do O

sure O

cried O
a O
voice O
above O
them O

“ O
Did O
you O
speak O
, O
Mr. O

“ O
N O

gasped O
the O
iron O

“ O
I O

  | O
“ O
Get O
out O

” O
cried O
the O

“ O

cried O
the O

in O
alarm O

“ O

“ O
None O

“ O
I O

resolutely O
. O
“ O
I O

” O

  | O
And O
as O
the O
words O
were O
uttered O
, O
a O
hand O
was O
thrust O
down O
from O
above O

which O
, O
grasping O
the O
dwarf O

     | O
by O
the O
nape O
of O
the O
neck O

drew O
him O
upwards O

“ O
Lay O

” O

  | O
Well O
- O
nigh O
stifled O
by O
the O
thickening O
and O
pungent O
vapour O
, O
the O
poor O
iron O
- O
merchant O
found O

     | O
compliance O
impossible O
. O
Before O
he O
could O
reach O
the O
dwarf O
, O
the O
little O
fellow O
was O
carried O
off O
. O
Left O
|
     | O
to O
himself O
, O
Mr. O
Thorneycroft B-PERSON
staggered O
along O
the O
passage O
, O
expecting O
every O
moment O
to O
drop O
, O
until O
|
     | O
at O
length O
a O
current O
of O
fresh O
air O
blew O
in O
his O
face O
, O
and O
enabled O
him O
to O
breathe O
more O
freely O
. O
|
     | O
Somewhat O
revived O
, O
he O
went O
on O
, O
but O
with O
great O
deliberation O
, O
and O
it O
was O
well O
he O
did O
so O
, O
for O
he O
|
     | O
suddenly O
arrived O
at O
the O
brink O
of O
a O
pit O
about B-QUANTITY
eight I-QUANTITY
feet I-QUANTITY
in O
depth O
, O
into O
which O
, O
if O
he O
had O
|
     | O
approached O
it O
incautiously O
, O
he O
must O
infallibly O
have O
stumbled O
, O
and O
in O
all O
probability O
have O
|
     | O
broken O
his O
neck O
. O
This O
pit O
evidently O
communicated O
with O
a O
lower O
range O
of O
chambers O
, O
as O
was O
shown O
|
     | O
by O
a O
brazen O
lamp O
burning O
under O
an O
archway O
. O
A O
ladder O
was O
planted O
at O
one O
side O
, O
and O
by O
this O
Mr. O

     | O
Thorneycroft B-PERSON
descended O
, O
but O
scarcely O
had O
he O
set O
foot O
on O
the O
ground O
, O
than O
he O
felt O
himself O
rudely O
|
     | O
grasped O
by O
a O
man O
who O
stepped O
from O
under O
the O
archway O
. O
The O
next O
moment O
, O
however O
, O
he O
was O
released O
, O
|
     | O
while O
the O
familiar O
voice O
of O
the O
Tinker B-ORG
exclaimed O

The O

His O

about O
his O

his O

a O

stony O

him O
was O

His O
garb O
was O
not O
that O
of O

consisted O

After O

Auriol B-PERSON
opened O
the O

began O
to O
turn O

It O
was O
full O
of O
magical O
disquisitions O

mysterious O

     | O
characters O
, O
and O
he O
found O
inscribed O
on O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
its O
earlier O
pages O
a O
name O
which O
instantly O
riveted O

     | O
his O
attention O

Having O
vainly O
sought O
some O
explanation O
of O
this O
name O
in O
the O

contents O
of O
the O

     | O
book O

he O
laid O
it O
aside O
, O
and O
became O
lost O
in O
meditation O
. O
His O
reverie O
ended O
, O
he O
heaved O
a O
deep O
|
     | O
sigh O
, O
and O
turned O
again O
to O
the O
open O
volume O
lying O
before O
him O
, O
and O
in O
doing O
so O
his O
eye O
rested O
for O

     | O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
on O
his O
habiliments O

On O
beholding O
them O
he O
started O

held O
out O
his O
arm O
to O

     | O
examine O
his O
sleeve O
more O
narrowly O
. O
Satisfied O
that O
he O
was O
not O
deceived O
, O
he O
arose O
and O
examined O

     | O
himself O
from O
head O
to O
foot O

He O
found O
himself O
, O
as O

attired O
in O
the O

“ O

“ O

O O
Heaven O

that O
the O

Oh O

yet O

real O

so O
that O

I O
can O
not O
bear O
to O
think O

that O

nothing O

But O
it O
must O
be O

what O

Methought O

my O

” O

And O
thrusting O
his O
hand O
into O
his O
doublet O

he O
drew O
forth O
some O
tablets O

hastily O
examined O

them O

They O
bore O
his O

contained O

who O

himself O

“ O

“ O

repeat O
, O
I O
dare O
not O
. O
You O
are O
not O
|
     | O
sufficiently O
master O
of O
yourself O
. O
” O
| 
  | O
“ O
Try O
me O
, O
” O
said O
Auriol B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
Well O
, O
” O
rejoined O
the O
other O
, O
“ O
I O
will O
see O
what O
I O
can O
do O
to O
calm O
you O
. O
” O
| 
  | O
So O
saying O
, O
he O
disappeared O
for O
a O
few O
moments O
, O
and O
then O
returning O
with O
a O
torch O
, O
placed O
it O
on O
|
     | O
the O
ground O
, O
and O
producing O
a O
phial O
, O
handed O
it O
to O
the O
captive O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
Drink O
! O
” O
he O
said O
. O
| 
  | O
Without O
a O
moment O
’s O
hesitation O
Auriol B-PERSON
complied O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
It O
seems O
to O
me O
rather O
a O
stimulant O
than O
a O
soothing O
potion O
, O
” O
he O
remarked O
, O
after O
emptying O
the O
|
     | O
phial O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
You O
are O
in O
no O
condition O
to O
judge O
, O
” O
rejoined O
the O
other O
. O
| 
  | O
And O
he O
proceeded O
to O
unfasten O
Auriol B-PERSON
’s O
chain O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
Now O
then O
, O
come O
with O
me O
, O
” O
he O
said O
, O
“ O
and O
do O
not O
make O
any O
attempt O
at O
evasion O
, O
or O
you O
will O
rue O
|
     | O
it O
. O
” O
| 
  | O
Like O
one O
in O
a O
dream O
, O
Auriol B-PERSON
followed O
his O
conductor O
down O
the O
flight O
of O
stone O
steps O
leading O
|
     | O
from O
the O
dungeon O
, O
and O
along O
a O
narrow O
passage O
. O
As O
he O
proceeded O
, O
he O
thought O
he O
heard O
stealthy O
|
     | O
footsteps O
behind O
him O
  O
but O
he O
never O
turned O
his O
head O
, O
to O
see O
whether O
he O
was O
really O
followed O
. O
In O
|
     | O
this O
way O
they O
reached O
a O
short O
steep O
staircase O
, O
and O
mounting O
it O
, O
entered O
a O
vault O
, O
in O
which O
|
     | O
Rougemont B-ORG
paused O
, O
and O
placed O
the O
torch O
he O
had O
brought O
with O
him O
upon O
the O
floor O
. O
Its O
lurid O
|
     | O
glimmer O
partially O
illumined O
the O
chamber O
, O
and O
showed O
that O
it O
was O
built O
of O
stone O
. O
Rude O
benches O
of O
|
     | O
antique O
form O
were O
set O
about O
the O
vault O
, O
and O
motioning O
Auriol B-PERSON
to O
be O
seated O
upon O
one O
of O
them O
, O
|
     | O
Rougemont B-ORG
sounded O
a O
silver O
whistle O
. O
The O
summons O
was O
shortly O
afterwards O
answered O
by O
the O
dwarf O
, O
|
     | O
in O
whose O
attire O
a O
new O
change O
had O
taken O
place O
. O
He O
was O
now O
clothed O
in O
a O
jerkin O
of O
grey O
serge O
, O
|
     | O
fashioned O
like O
the O
garments O
worn O
by O
the O
common O
people O
in O
Elizabeth B-PERSON
’s O
reign O
, O
and O
wore O
a O
|
     | O
trencher O
- O
cap O
on O
his O
head O
. O
Auriol B-PERSON
watched O
him O
as O
he O
timidly O
advanced O
towards O
Rougemont B-GPE
, O
and O
had O
|
     | O
an O
indistinct O
recollection O
of O
having O
seen O
him O
before O
  O
but O
could O
not O
call O
to O
mind O
how O
or O
|
     | O
where O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
Is O
your O
master O
a O
- O
bed O
? O
” O
demanded O
Rougemont B-ORG
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
A O
- O
bed O
! O
Good O
lack O
, O
sir O
! O
” O
exclaimed O
the O
dwarf O
, O
“ O
little O
of O
sleep O

Doctor O
Lamb B-PERSON

He O
will O

” O

  | O
“ O
Doctor O

repeated O
Auriol B-PERSON
. O
“ O
Surely O
I O
have O
heard O
that O
name O
before O
? O
” O
| 
  | O
“ O
Very O
likely O
, O
” O
replied O
Rougemont B-ORG
, O
“ O
for O
it O
is O
the O
name O
borne O
by O
your O
nearest O
kinsman O
. O
” O
| 
  | O
“ O
How O
is O
the O
poor O
young O
gentleman O
? O
” O
asked O
the O
dwarf O
, O
glancing O
commiseratingly O
at O
Auriol B-ORG
. O
“ O
My O
|
     | O
master O
often O
makes O
inquiries O
after O
his O
grandson O

grieves O
that O
the O
state O
of O
his O
mind O
should O

     | O
render O
it O
necessary O

“ O

“ O

returned O
the O

“ O
Were O
you O

you O
would O

He O
assumes O
the O
name O

     | O
of O
Doctor O
Lamb B-PERSON
to O
delude O
the O
multitude O

He O
told O
you O
as O
much O
yourself O

sweet O
sir O
, O
if O
your O

Auriol B-PERSON

“ O
Alack O

the O

“ O
Where O

asked O
Auriol B-PERSON

“ O
Why O
here O

replied O
the O
dwarf O
  O
“ O

are O
damp O

” O
| 
  | O
Auriol B-PERSON
was O
lost O
in O
reflection O
, O

did O
not O
observe O
a O
sign O
that O
passed O
between O
the O
dwarf O

     | O
Rougemont B-ORG
. O

“ O
Will O
it O
disturb O

up O

the O
latter O

a O
brief O

     | O
pause O

seldom O

any O

I O

so O

bold O

Auriol B-PERSON

rising O
. O

“ O
Sit O
down O

sit O
down O

the O
chamber O
by O
a O
farther O
outlet O
with O
the O
dwarf O

During O
the O
short O
time O
that O
Auriol B-PERSON
was O
left O
alone O
, O
he O
found O
it O
vain O
to O
attempt O

settle O
his O

thoughts O

to O
convince O
himself O

under O
some O
strange O
delusion O

was O
aroused O

length O

returned O
alone O

“ O
Your O

“ O
One B-CARDINAL

“ O
Saints O

how O
you O

Auriol B-PERSON

taking O
up O
the O
torch O

he O
led O
the O
way O
out O
of O
the O
chamber O

Mounting O
a O
spiral O
staircase O
, O

     | O
apparently O
within O

they O
came O
to O
a O
door O

being O
opened O
by O

disclosed O
a O

     | O
scene O
that O
well O

stupefied O
Auriol B-PERSON

It O

it O
above O
two B-DATE

The O

was O
covered O
with O

The O

He O
moved O
his O

as O
Auriol B-PERSON

the O

the O

better O
. O
” O
| 
  | O
“ O
Are O
you O
indeed O
living O
? O
” O
cried O
Auriol B-PERSON
, O
rushing O
wildly O
towards O
him O
, O
and O
attempting O
to O
take O
his O
|
     | O
hand O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
Off O
— O
off O
! O
” O
cried O
the O
old O
man O
, O
drawing O
back O
as O
if O
alarmed O
. O
“ O
You O
disturb O
my O
operations O
. O
Keep O
|
     | O
him O
calm O
, O
Flapdragon B-GPE
, O
or O
take O
him O
hence O
. O
He O
may O
do O
me O
a O
mischief O
. O
” O
| 
  | O
“ O
I O
have O
no O
such O
intention O
, O
sir O
, O
” O
said O
Auriol B-PERSON
  O
“ O
indeed O
I O
have O
not O
. O
I O
only O
wish O
to O
be O
assured O
|
     | O
that O
you O
are O
my O
aged O
relative O
. O
” O
| 
  | O
“ O
To O
be O
sure O
he O
is O
, O
young O
sir O
, O
” O
interposed O
the O
dwarf O
. O
“ O
Why O
should O
you O
doubt O
it O
? O
” O
| 
  | O
“ O
O O
sir O
, O
” O
cried O
Auriol B-PERSON
, O
throwing O
himself O
at O
the O
old O
man O
’s O
feet O
, O
“ O
pity O
me O
if O
I O
am O
mad O
  O
but O
|
     | O
offer O
me O
some O
explanation O
, O
which O
may O
tend O
to O
restore O
me O
to O
my O
senses O
. O
My O
reason O
seems O
gone O
, O
yet O
|
     | O
I O
appear O
capable O
of O
receiving O
impressions O
from O
external O
objects O
. O
I O
see O
you O
, O
and O
appear O
to O
know O
|
     | O
you O
. O
I O
see O
this O
chamber O
— O
these O
alchemical O
implements O
— O
that O
furnace O
— O
these O
different O
objects O
— O
and O
I O
|
     | O
appear O
to O
recognise O
them O
. O
Am O
I O
deceived O
, O
or O
is O
this O
real O
? O
” O
| 
  | O
“ O
You O
are O
not O
deceived O
, O
my O
son O
, O
” O
replied O
the O
old O
man O
. O
“ O
You O
have O
been O
in O
this O
room O
before O
, O
and O
|
     | O
you O
have O
seen O
me O
before O
. O
It O
would O
be O
useless O
to O
explain O
to O
you O
now O
how O
you O
have O
suffered O
from O
|
     | O
fever O
, O
and O
what O
visions O
your O
delirium O
has O
produced O
. O
When O
you O
are O
perfectly O
restored O
, O
we O
will O
|
     | O
talk O
the O
matter O
over O
. O
” O
| 
  | O
And O
, O
as O
he O
said O
this O
, O
he O
began O
to O
blow O
the O
fire O
anew O
, O
and O
watched O
with O
great O
apparent O
|
     | O
interest O
the O
changing O
colours O
of O
the O
liquid O
in O
the O
cucurbite O
placed O
on O
the O
furnace O
. O
| 
  | O
Auriol B-PERSON
looked O
at O
him O
earnestly O
, O
but O
could O
not O
catch O
another O
glance O
, O
so O
intently O
was O
the O
old O
|
     | O
man O
occupied O
. O
At O
length O
he O
ventured O
to O
break O
the O
silence O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
I O
should O
feel O
perfectly O
convinced O
, O
if O
I O
might O
look O
forth O
from O
that O
window O
, O
” O
he O
said O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
Convinced O
of O
what O
? O
” O
rejoined O
the O
old O
man O
somewhat O
sharply O
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
That O
I O
am O
what O
I O
seem O
, O
” O
replied O
Auriol B-WORK_OF_ART
. O
| 
  | O
“ O
Look O
forth O
, O
then O
, O
” O
said O
the O
old O
man O
. O
“ O
But O
do O
not O
disturb O
me O
by O
idle O
talk O
. O
There O
is O
the O
rosy O
|
     | O
colour O
in O
the O
projection O
for O
which O
I O
have O
been O
so O
long O
waiting O
. O
” O
| 
  | O
Auriol B-PERSON
then O
walked O
to O
the O
window O
and O
gazed O
through O
the O
tinted O
panes O
. O
It O
was O
very O
dark O
, O
and O
|
     | O
objects O
could O
only O
be O
imperfectly O
distinguished O
. O
Still O
he O
fancied O
he O
could O
detect O
the O
gleam O
of O
|
     | O
the O
river O
beneath O
him O
, O
and O
what O
seemed O
a O
long O
line O
of O
houses O
on O
the O
bridge O
. O
He O
also O
fancied O
he O
|
     | O
discerned O
other O
buildings O
, O
with O
the O
high O
roofs O
, O
the O
gables O
, O
and O
the O
other O
architectural O
|
     | O
peculiarities O
of O
the O
structures O
of O
Elizabeth B-PERSON
’s O
time O
. O
He O
persuaded O
himself O
, O
also O
, O
that O
he O
could O
|
     | O
distinguish O
through O
the O
gloom O
the O
venerable O
Gothic B-ORG
pile O
of O
Saint B-ORG
Paul I-ORG
’s I-ORG
Cathedral O
on O
the O
other O
|
     | O
side O
of O
the O
water O
, O
and O
, O
as O
if O
to O
satisfy O
him O
that O
he O
was O
right O
, O
a O
deep O
solemn O
bell O
tolled O
forth O
|
     | O
the O
hour O
of O
two B-CARDINAL
. O
After O
a O
while O
he O
returned O
from O
the O
window O
, O
and O
said O
to O
his O
supposed O
grandsire O
, O
|
     | O
“ O
I O
am O
satisfied O

I O
have O
lived O
centuries O
in O
