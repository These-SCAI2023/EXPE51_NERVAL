The O

” O
While O
Baldred S-PERSON
was O
ruminating O
in O
this O
manner O
, O
a O
sudden O
and O
extraordinary O
change O
took O
place O
in O
the O
sufferer O
. O
As O
if O
by O
magic O
, O
the O
contraction O
of O
the O
muscles O
subsided O

the O
features O
assumed O
a O
wholesome O
hue O
, O
and O
the O
respiration O
was O
no O
longer O
laborious O
. O
Baldred S-PERSON
stared O
as O
if O
a O
miracle O
had O
been O
wrought O
. O
Now O
that O
the O
countenance O
of O
the O
youth O
had O
regained O
its O
original O
expression O
, O
the O
gatekeeper O
could O
not O
help O
being O
struck O
by O
its O
extreme O
beauty O
. O
The O
face O
was O
a O
perfect O
oval O
, O
with O
regular O
and O
delicate O
features O
. O
A O
short O
silken O
moustache O
covered O
the O
upper O
lip O
, O
which O
was O
short O
and O
proud O
, O
and O
a O
pointed O
beard O
terminated O
the O
chin O
. O
The O
hair O
was O
black O
, O
glossy O
, O
and O
cut O
short O
, O
so O
as O
to O
disclose O
a O
highly O
intellectual O
expanse O
of O
brow O
. O
The O
youth's O
figure O
was O
slight O
, O
but O
admirably O
proportioned O
. O
His O
attire O
consisted O
of O
a O
black O
satin O
doublet O
, O
slashed O
with O
white O
, O
hose O
of O
black O
silk O
, O
and O
a O
short O
velvet O
mantle O
. O
His O
eyes O
were O
still O
closed O
, O
and O
it O
was O
difficult O
to O
say O
what O
effect O
they O
might O
give O
to O
the O
face O
when O
they O
lighted O
it O
up O

but O
8 S-CARDINAL
AURIOL S-PERSON
. O
notwithstanding O
its O
beauty O
, O
it O
was O
impossible O
not O
to O
admit O
that O
a O
strange O
, O
sinister O
, O
and O
almost O
demoniacal O
expression O
pervaded O
the O
countenance O
. O
All O
at O
once O
, O
and O
with O
as O
much O
suddenness O
as O
his O
cure O
had O
been O
effected O
, O
the O
young O
man O
started O
, O
uttering O
a O
piercing O
cry O
, O
and O
placed O
his O
hand O
to O
his O
side O
. O
“ O
Caitiff S-PERSON
! O
” O
he O
cried O
, O
fixing O
his O
blazing O
eyes O
on O
the O
gate- O
keeper O
, O
“ O

And O
overcome O
by O
anguish O

he O
sank O
back O
again O

“ O

Doctor O

must O
have O
wiped O

he O
added O
to O
himself O
. O
Another O
sudden O
change O
. O
The O
pain O
fled O
from O
the O
suf- O
ferer's O
countenance O
, O
and O
he O
became O
easy O
as O
before O
. O
“ O
What O
have O
you O
done O
to O
me O
? O
” O
he O
asked O
, O
with O
a O
look O
of O
gratitude O

“ O

“ O
One S-CARDINAL
was O
so O

with O

“ O

Listen O

you O
shall O
hear O
how O
it O
chanced O
. O
A O
Roman S-NORP
rabbi O
, O
named O
Ben B-PERSON
Lucca E-PERSON
, O
skilled O
in O
Hermetic O
science O
, O
came O
to O
this O
city O
. O
His O
fame O
reached O
me O
, O
and O
I O
sought O
him O
out O
, O
offering O
myself O
as O
his O
disciple O
. O
For O
months S-DATE
, O
I O
remained O
with O
him O
in O
his O
laboratory O
— O
working O
at O
the O
furnace O
, O
and O
poring O
over O
mystic O
lore O
. O
One B-TIME
night E-TIME
, O
he O
showed O
me O
that O
volume O
, O
and O
, O
pointing O
to O
a O
page O
within O
it O
, O
said O
: O
‘ O
Those O
characters O
contain O
the O
secret O
of O

I O
will O
now O
explain O
them O
to O

and O
afterwards O
we O
will O
proceed O
to O
the O
operation O
. O
’ O
With O
this O
, O
he O
unfolded O
the O
mystery O

but O
he O
bade O
me O
observe O
, O
that O
the O
menstruum O
was O
defective O
on O
one S-CARDINAL
point O
. O
Wherefore O
, O
he O
said O
, O
‘ O
there O
will O
still O
be O

some O
hidden O

’ O
Oh O
, O
with O
what O
greediness O
I O
drank O
in O
his O
words O
! O
How O
I O
gazed O

at O
the O
mystic O

What O

floated O
before O

of O
perpetual O

At O
that O
moment O
a O
demon O
whispered O
in O
my O

, O
— O
‘ O

“ O

curiously O

his O

were O
keen O

sparkling O

was O
as O
singular O

little O

a O

girded O
round O

In O
this O
strange O

by O

some O

Mr. O

burst O
into O
a O
roar O

laughter O

excited O
by O
the O

grotesque O

Their O
hilarity O
, O
however O
, O
was O
suddenly O
checked O
by O
an O
inquiry O
from O
the O

, O
in O
a O
shrill O

odd O
tone O
, O
“ O

to O
the O

I O
found O
the O

whether O
to O
pursue O
his O

on O
reflection O

I O
next O
looked O
round O

the O
precious O

gone O

On O
the O
table O

a O
phial O

a O
strong O

it O

connected O
by O
a O
worm O
with O
an O
alembic O
on O
the O
furnace O

On O
examining O
it O
, O
I O
found O
it O
contained O
a O
small O
quantity O
of O
a O
bright O
transparent O
liquid O
, O
which O
, O
poured O
forth O
into O
a O
glass O

emitted O
precisely O
58 S-CARDINAL
AURIOL S-PERSON
. O
the O
same O
odour O
as O
the O
phial O

Persuaded O
this O
must O
be O
the O
draught O

immortality O

raised O
it O
to O
my O
lips O

apprehension O

be O
poison O
stayed O
my O

however O
, O
by O
the O
thought O
of O
the O
young O

miraculous O
recovery O

I O
quaffed O
the O

was O

fire O

at O

I O
thought O
all O

over O

I O
shrieked O
out O

there O
was O
no O

heed O
my O

my O

two S-CARDINAL

the O

garnished O

these O

in O
truth O

did O
seem O
to O
hear O
me O

for O
the O
dead O
corpse O
opened O
its O
glassy O
orbs O

eyed O

reproachfully O

the O
skeletons O
shook O
their O

the O
various O

terror O
occasioned O
by O
these O

combined O
with O
the O
potency O

the O

took O
away O

recovered O

I O
found O

tranquil O

THE O

was O
an O

to O
the O

, O
where O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
men O
before O

were O
busy O
at O
the O

. O
Though O
it O
was O
still O
early O
, O
the O
road O
was O
astir O
with O
pas- O
sengers O
, O
and O
many O
waggons O

carts O
, O
laden O
with O

Ebba S-PERSON
, O
however O
, O
had O
been O
solely O
drawn O
forth O
by O
the O
beauty O
of O
the O
morning O
, O
and O
she O
stopped O
for O
a O
moment O
at O
the O
street O
gate O
, O
to O
breathe O
the O
balmy O
air O
. O
As O
she O
inhaled O
the O
gentle O
breeze O
, O
and O
felt O
the O
warm O
sunshine O
upon O
her O
check O
, O
her O
thoughts O
wandered O
away O
into O
the O
green O
meadows O
in O
which O
she O
had O
strayed O
as O
a O
child O
, O
and O
she O
longed O
to O
ramble O
amid O
them O
again O
. O
Per- O
haps O
she O
scarcely O
desired O
a O
solitary O
stroll O

but O
however O
this O
. O
might O
be O
, O
she O
was O
too O
much O
engrossed O
by O
the O
reverie O
to O
notice O
a O
tall O
man O
, O
wrapped O
in O
a O
long O
black O
cloak O
, O
who O
re- O
garded O
her O
with O
the O
most O
fixed O
attention O
, O
as O
he O
passed O
on O
the O
opposite O
side O
of O
the O
road O
. O
Proceeding O
to O
a O
short O
distance O
, O
this O
personage O
crossed O
over O
, O
and O
returned O
slowly O
towards O
the O
iron O
- O
merchant’s O
dwelling O
. O
Ebba S-PERSON
then O
, O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
, O
remarked O
him O
, O
and O
was O
startled O
by O
his O
strange O
, O
sinister O
appearance O
. O
His O
features O
were O
handsome O
, O
but O
so O
malignant O
and O
fierce O
in O
ex- O
pression O
, O
that O
they O
inspired O
only O
aversion O
. O
A O
sardonic O
grin O
curled O
his O
thin O
lips O
, O
and O
his O
short O
, O
crisply O
- O
curled O
hair O
, O
raven O
black O
in O
hue O
, O
contrasted O
forcibly O
and O
disagreeably O
with O
his O
cadaverous O
complexion O
. O
An O
attraction O
like O
that O
of O
the O
snake O
seemed O
to O
reside O
in O
his O
dark O
blazing O
eyes O
, O
for O
Ebba S-PERSON
trembled O
like O
a O
bird O
beneath O
their O
influence O
, O
and O
could O
not O
remove O
her O
gaze O
from O
them O
. O
A O
vague O
presentiment O
of O
66 S-CARDINAL
AURIOL S-PERSON
. O
coming O
ill O
smote O
her O
, O
and O
she O
dreaded O
lest O
the O
mysterious O
being O
before O
her O
might O
be O
connected O
in O
some O
inexplicable O
way O
with O
her O
future O
destiny O
. O
On O
his O
part O
, O
the O
stranger O
was O
not O
insensible O
to O
the O
im- O
pression O
he O
had O
produced O
, O
and O
suddenly O
halting O
, O
he O
kept O
his O
eyes O
riveted O
on O
those O
of O
the O
girl O
, O
who O
, O
after O
remaining O

- O
bound O
, O
as O
it O

, O
for O
a O
few O
moments O
, O
precipitately O
re- O
treated O
towards O
the O
house O

Just O
as O
she O
reached O
the O
door O
, O
and O
was O
about O
to O
pass O
through O
it O
, O
Auriol S-PERSON
came O
forth O
. O
He O
was O
pale O
, O
as O
if O
from O
recent O
suffering O
, O
and O
bore O
his O
left O
arm O
in O
a O
sling O

“ O

” O

“ O

she O
replied O
, O
a O
deep O
blush O
mantling O
her O
cheeks O
. O
“ O
But O
I O
have O
been O
somewhat O

“ O
Who O

demanded O
Ebba S-PERSON

“ O
He O

“ O
Are O

she O
asked O
, O
glancing O
timor- O
ously O
up O

down O
the O

the O

somewhat O

Ebba S-PERSON

his O

advancing O
close O

it O

” O
The O
current O
of O
his O
thoughts O
were O
here O
interrupted O
by O
the O
sudden O
appearance O
of O
a O
dark O
object O
on O
the O
surface O
of O
the O
water O

which O
he O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
took O
to O
be O
a O
huge O
fish O
, O
with O
a O
pair O
of O
green O
fins O
springing O
from O
its O
back O

but O
after O
watching O
it O
more O
closely O
for O
a O
few O
moments O
, O
he O
became O
convinced O
that O
it O
was O
a O
human O
being O
, O
tricked O
out O
in O
some O
masquerade O
attire O

while O
the O
slight O
struggles O
which O
it O
made O
proved O
that O
life O
was O
not O
entirely O
extinct O

only O
been O
restrained O
from O
the O
attempt O
by O
the O
certainty O
of O
failing O
in O
his O
purpose O

instinct O
prompted O
him O
to O
rescue O

perishing O
creature O
before O
him O

Without O
hesitation O

therefore O
, O
and O
without O
tarrying O
to O
divest O
himself O
of O
his O
clothes O
, O
he O
dashed O
into O
the O
water O
, O
and O
striking O
out O
, O
instantly O
reached O
the O
object O
of O

still O
con- O
tinued O

turning O
it O
over O
, O
for O
the O
face O
was O
down O

he O
perceived O
it O
was O
an O
old O
man O
, O
of O
exceedingly O
small O
size O
, O
habited O
in O
a O
pantomimic O

also O
remarked O
THE O
MEETING O
NEAR O

73 S-CARDINAL
that O
a O
rope O
was O
twisted O
round O
the O
neck O
of O
the O
unfortunate O
being O
, O
making O
it O
evident O
that O
some O
violent O
attempt O
had O
been O
made O
upon O
his O
life O
. O
: O
Without O
pausing O
for O
further O
investigation O
, O
he O
took O
firm O
hold O
of O
the O
leathern O
wings O
of O
the O
dwarf O
, O
and O
with O
his O
disen- O
gaged O
hand O
propelled O
himself O
towards O
the O
shore O
, O
dragging O
the O
other O
after O
him O
. O
The O
next O
instant O
he O
reached O
the O
bank O
, O
clambered O
up O
the O
low O
brickwork O
, O
and O
placed O
his O
burden O
in O
safety O
. O
The O
noise O
of O
the O
plunge O
had O
attracted O
attention O
, O
and O
several O
persons O
now O
hurried O
to O
the O
spot O

On O
coming O
up O
, O
and O
finding O
Auriol S-PERSON
bending O
over O
a O

— O
for O
such O
, O
at O
first O
sight O
, O
the O
dwarf O
appeared O
— O
they O
could O
not O
repress O
their O
astonishment O
. O
Wholly O
insensible O
to O
the O
presence O
of O
those O
around O
him O
, O
Auriol S-PERSON
endeavoured O
to O
recal O
where O
he O
had O
seen O
the O
dwarf O
before O
. O
All O
at O
once O
, O
the O
recollection O
flashed O
upon O
him O
, O
and O
he O
cried O
aloud O
, O
“ O
Why O
, O
it O
is O
my O
poor O
murdered O
grandfather's O
attendant O

no O

no O

Yet O
the O
resemblance O
is O
singularly O
striking O
! O
” O
Auriol’s S-PERSON
exclamations O
, O
coupled O
with O
his O
wild O
demeanour O
, O
surprised O
the O
bystanders O
, O
and O
they O
came O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
he O
must O
be O
a O
travelling O
showman O
, O
who O
had O
attempted O
to O
drown O
his O
dwarf O
— O
the O
grotesque O
, O
impish O
garb O
of O
the O

convincing O
them O
that O
he O
had O
been O
exhibited O
at O

raising O
the O

head O
on O
his O
knee O
, O
produced O
a O
flask O

and O
poured O
some O

from O
it O
down O
his O
throat O

Twas O

the O

“ O

“ O
By O

“ O

“ O
Some O

“ O
for O
I've O
been O

I O

only O
just O
managed O
to O
shake O
off O
the O

” O
At O
this O
speech O
there O
was O
a O
titter O
of O
incredulity O
among O
the O
bystanders O
. O
“ O
You O
may O
laugh O

it’s O

angrily O
. O
“ O
We O

“ O
Will O
you O

him O

the O

he O
added O

placing O
money O
in O
the O

Auriol S-PERSON

moving O
away O

And O
as O
he O
disappeared O
, O
the O
man O
took O
up O
his O
little O
burden O
, O

bent O
his O
steps O
towards O
the O

Utterly O
disregarding O
the O
dripping O
state O
of O
his O
habili- O

Auriol S-PERSON
proceeded O
quickly O

Arrived O
there O
, O
he O
looked O
around O

not O

flung O
himself O
upon O
a O

the O

the O

Auriol’s S-PERSON

were O
sombre O

the O
hour O
, O
and O
he O
fell O
into O
a O
deep O
fit O
of O
abstraction O
, O
from O
which O
he O
was O
roused O
by O
a O
hand O
laid O
on O
his O

Recoiling O
at O
the O
touch O

he O
raised O
his O

beheld O
the O

leaning O
over O
him O

gazing O
at O
him O
with O
a O
look O
of O
diabolical O
exultation O
, O
The O
cloak O
was O
thrown O
partly O
aside O
, O
so O
as O
to O
display O
the O
tall O

gaunt O
figure O
of O
its O
wearer O

the O
large O
collar O

Mr. O

the O
cream O

cast O

it O
out O

to O
the O
night O
of O
Ebba’s S-PERSON
seizure O
by O
the O
mysterious O
stranger O
. O
Though O
almost O
deprived O
of O
con- O
sciousness O
by O
terror O
, O
the O
poor O
girl O
could O
distinguish O
, O
from O
the O
movements O
of O
her O
captor O
, O
that O
she O
was O
borne O
down O
a O
flight O
of O
steps O
, O
or O
some O
steep O
descent O
, O
and O
then O
for O
a O
con- O
siderable O
distance O
along O
level O
ground O
. O
She O
was O
next O
placed O
in O
a O
carriage O
, O
which O
was O
driven O
with O
great O
swiftness O
, O
and O
though O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
conjecture O
in O
what O
direction O
she O
was O
conveyed O
, O
it O
seemed O
to O
her O
terrified O
imagination O
as O
if O
she O
were O
hurried O
down O
a O
precipice O
, O
and O
she O
expected O
every O
moment O
to O
be O
dashed O
in O
pieces O
. O
At O
length O
, O
the O
vehicle O
stopped O
, O
and O
she O
was O
lifted O
out O
of O
it O
, O
and O
carried O
along O
a O
winding O
passage O
| | O
after O
which O
, O
the O
creaking O
of O
hinges O
announced O
that O
a O
door O
was O
opened O
. O
Having O
passed O
THE O
CHAMBER O
OF O
MYSTERY O
. O
119 S-CARDINAL
through O
it O
, O
she O
was O
deposited O
on O
a O
bench O
, O
when O
, O
fright O
over O
- O
mastering O
her O
, O
her O
senses O
completely O
forsook O
her O
. O
On O
recovering O
, O
she O
found O
herself O
seated O
on O
a O
fauteuil O
covered O
with O
black O
velvet O
, O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
a O
gloomy O
chamber O
of O
vast O
extent O
, O
while O
beside O
her O
, O
and O
supporting O
her O
from O
falling O
, O
stood O
the O
mysterious O
and O
terrible O
stranger O
. O
He O
held O
a O
large O
goblet O
filled O
with O
some O
potent O
liquid O
to O
her O
lips O
, O
and O
compelled O
her O
to O
swallow O
a O
portion O
of O
it O
. O
The O
powerful O
stimulant O
revived O
her O
, O
but O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
pro- O
duced O
a O
strange O
excitement O
, O
against O
which O
she O
struggled O
with O
all O
her O
power O
. O
Her O
persecutor O
again O
held O
the O
goblet O
towards O
her O
, O
while O
a O
sardonic O
smile O
played O
upon O
his O
features O
. O
“ O
Drink O
! O
” O
he O
cried O
| | O
“ O
it O
will O
restore O
you O
, O
and O
you O
have O
much O
to O
go O
through O
. O
” O
Ebba S-PERSON
mechanically O
took O
the O
cup O
, O
and O
raised O
it O
to O
her O
lips O
, O
but O
noticing O
the O
stranger’s O
glance O
of O
exultation O
, O
dashed O
it O
to O
the O
ground O
. O
“ O
You O
have O
acted O
foolishly O
, O
” O
he O
said O
, O
sternly O
| | O
“ O
the O
potion O
would O
have O
done O
you O
good O
. O
” O
Withdrawing O
her O
eyes O
from O
his O
gaze O
, O
which O
she O
felt O
exercised O
an O
irresistible O
influence O
over O
her O
, O
Ebba S-PERSON
gazed O
fear O
- O
fully O
round O
the O
chamber O
. O
It O
was O
vast O
and O
gloomy O
, O
and O
seemed O
like O
the O
interior O
of O
a O
sepulchre O
— O
the O
walls O
and O
ceiling O
being O
formed O
of O
black O
marble O
, O
while O
the O
floor O
was O
paved O
with O
the O
same O
material O
. O
Not O
far O
from O
where O
she O
sat O
, O
on O
an O
estrade O
, O
approached O
by O
a O
couple O
of O
steps O
, O
stood O
a O
table O
covered O
with O
black O
velvet O
, O
on O
which O
was O
placed O
an O
immense O
lamp O
, O
fashioned O
like O
an O
imp O
supporting O
a O
caldron O
on O
his O
outstretched O
wings O
. O
In O
120 S-CARDINAL
AURIOL S-PERSON
. O
this O
lamp O
were O
several O
burners O
, O
which O
cast O
a O
lurid O
light O
throughout O
the O
chamber O
. O
Over O
it O
hung O
a O
cap O
equally O
fan- O
tastically O
fashioned O
. O
A O
dagger O
, O
with O
a O
richly O
- O
wrought O
hilt O
, O
was O
stuck O
into O
the O
table O
| | O
and O
beside O
it O
lay O
a O
strangely O
shaped O
mask O
, O
an O
open O
book O
, O
an O
antique O
inkstand O
, O
and O
a O
piece O
of O
parchment O
, O
on O
which O
some O
characters O
were O
inscribed O
. O
Opposite O
these O
stood O
a O
curiously O
- O
carved O
ebony O
chair O
. O
At O
the O
lower O
end O
of O
the O
room O
, O
which O
was O
slightly O
elevated O
above O
the O
rest O
, O
hung O
a O
large O
black O
curtain O

and O
on O
the O
step O
, O
in O
the O
front O
of O
it O
, O
were O
placed O
two S-CARDINAL
vases O
of O
jet O
. O
“ O
What O
is O
behind O
that O
curtain O
? O
” O
shudderingly O
demanded O
Ebba S-PERSON
of O
her O
companion O
. O
“ O
You O
will O
see O
anon O
, O
” O
he O
replied O
. O
‘ O
Meanwhile O
, O
seat O
yourself O
on O
that O
chair O
, O
and O
glance O
at O
the O
writing O
on O
the O
scroll O
. O
” O
Ebba S-PERSON
did O
not O
move O
, O
but O
the O
stranger O
took O
her O
hand O
, O
and O
drew O
her O
to O
the O
seat O
. O
“ O
Read O
what O
is O
written O
on O
that O
paper O
, O
” O
he O
cried O
, O
im O
- O
poriously O
, O
Ebba S-PERSON
glanced O
at O
the O
document O
, O
and O
a O
shudder O
passed O
over O
her O
frame O
, O
“ O
By O
this O
, O
” O
she O
cried O
, O
“ O
I O
surrender O
myself O
, O
soul O
and O
body O
, O
to O
you O
? O
” O
“ O
You O
do O
, O
” O
replied O
the O
stranger O
. O
“ O
T O
have O
committed O
no O
crime O
that O
can O
place O
me O
within O
the O
power O
of O
the O
Fiend O
, O
” O
cried O
Ebba S-PERSON
, O
falling O
upon O
her O
knees O
. O
“ O
I O
call O
upon O
Heaven O
for O
protection O
! O
Avaunt O
! O
” O
As O
the O
words O
were O
uttered O
, O
the O
cap O
suddenly O
fell O
upon O

121 S-CARDINAL
the O
lamp O
, O
and O
the O
chamber O
was O
buried O
in O
profound O
darkness O
. O
Mocking O
laughter O
rang O
in O
her O
ears O
, O
succeeded O
by O
wailing O
cries O
inexpressibly O
dreadful O
to O
hear O
. O
Ebba S-PERSON
continued O
to O
pray O
fervently O
for O
her O
own O
deliverance O
, O
and O
for O
that O
of O
Auriol S-PERSON
. O
In O
the O
midst O
of O
her O
supplications O
she O
was O
aroused O
by O
strains O
of O
music O
of O
the O
most O
exquisite O
sweetness O
, O
proceeding O
apparently O
from O
behind O
the O
curtain O
, O
and O
while O
listening O
to O
these O
sounds O
she O
was O
startled O
by O
a O
deafening O
crash O
as O
if O
a O
large O
gong O
had O
been O
stricken O
. O
The O
cover O
of O
the O
lamp O
was O
then O
slowly O
raised O
, O
and O
the O
burners O
blazed O
forth O
as O
before O
, O
while O
from O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
vases O
in O
front O
of O
the O
curtain O
arose O
clouds O
of O
incense O
, O
filling O
the O
chamber O
with O
stupifying O
fragrance O
. O
Again O
the O
gong O
was O
stricken O
, O
and O
Ebba S-PERSON
looked O
round O
towards O
the O
curtain O
. O
Above O
each O
vase O
towered O
a O
gigantic O
figure O
, O
wrapped O
in O
a O
long O
black O
cloak O
, O
the O
lower O
part O
of O
which O
was O
concealed O
by O
the O
thick O
vapour O
. O
Hoods O
, O
like O
the O
cowls O
of O
monks O
, O
were O
drawn O
over O
the O
heads O
of O
these O
grim O
and O
motionless O
figures O
| | O
mufflers O
enveloped O
their O
chins O
, O
and O
they O
wore O
masks O
, O
from O
the O
holes O
of O
which O
gleamed O
eyes O
of O
unearthly O
brightness O
. O
Their O
hands O
were O
crossea O
upon O
their O
breasts O
. O
Between O
them O
squatted O
two S-CARDINAL
other O
spectral O
forms O

similarly O
cloaked O

hooded O

and O
masked O

with O
their O
gleaming O
eyes O
fixed O
upon O
her O
, O
and O
their O
skinny O
fingers O
pointed O
derisively O
at O
her O
. O
Behind O
the O
curtain O
was O
placed O
a O
strong O
light O
, O
which O
showed O
a O
wide O
staircase O
of O
black O
marble O
, O
leading O
to O
some O
upper O
chamber O
, O

at O
the O
same O
time O
threw O
the O
reflection O
of O
122 S-CARDINAL
AURIOL S-PERSON
. O
a O
gigantic O
figure O
upon O
the O
drapery O
, O
while O
a O
hand O
, O
the O
finger O
of O
which O
pointed O
towards O
her O
, O
was O
thrust O
from O
an O
opening O
between O
its O
folds O
. O
Forcibly O
averting O
her O
gaze O
, O
Ebba S-PERSON
covered O
her O
eyes O
with O
her O
hands O
, O
but O
looking O
up O
again O
after O
a O
brief O
space O
, O
beheld O
an O
ebon O
door O
at O
the O
side O
revolve O
upon O
its O
hinges O
, O
and O
give O
entrance O

three S-CARDINAL
female O

robed O
in O
black O

hooded O

yeiled O

having O
their O
hands O
folded O

in O
a O
melancholy O
manner O
, O
across O
their O
breasts O
. O
Slowly O
and_noiselessly O
advancing O
, O
they O
halted O
within O
a O
few O
paces O
of O
her O
. O
“ O
Who O
, O
and O
what O
are O
ye O
? O
” O
she O
cried O
, O
wild O
with O
terror O
. O
“ O
The O
victims O
of O
Auriol S-PERSON

” O
replied O
the O
figure O
on O
the O
right O

“ O
As O
we O

such O
will O
you O

“ O
What O

” O
demanded O
Ebba S-PERSON

“ O
We O
have O

“ O

“ O
If O

“ O
You O

replied O
the O
third S-ORDINAL

“ O
Heaven O
have O
mercy O
upon O

” O
exclaimed O
the O
agonised O
girl O
, O
dropping O
upon O
her O
knees O
. O
At O
this O
moment O
a O
terrible O
voice O
from O
behind O
the O
curtain O
exclaimed O
— O
“ O

a O

And O
at O
the O

muffled O
up O

slowly O

remained O
motionless O

“ O

“ O

“ O

“ O

At O
this O

the O

, O
to O
his O
unspeakable O
horror O
, O
Auriol S-PERSON
beheld O
it O
take O
up O
the O

write O
upon O
the O

He O
bent O

saw O

The O
groan O
to O
which O
he O
gave O
utterance O
was O
echoed O
by O
a O
roar O
of O
diabolical O
laughter O
. O
The O

then O
moved O
slowly O
away O

itself O

“ O

“ O

On O
this O

a O
terrible O

was O

Pausing O
before O
the O

the O

threw O
the O
light O

full O
upon O
it O
, O

revealed O
features O
somewhat O

of O

severe O

After O
regarding O
the O

some O

he O
was O
disappointed O

All O

At O

“ O

closing O

“ O

Auriol S-PERSON

gazing O
around O

furiously O

‘ O
Show O
yourself O

A O
mocking O
laugh O

the O
only O
response O
deigned O
to O
this O
injunction O
. O
“ O
Give O
me O
back O
the O
compact O
, O
” O
cried O
Auriol S-PERSON
, O
imploringly O
. O
“ O
Tt O
was O
signed O
in O

I O

” O
“ O
Without O

the O

‘ O

you O

think O
better O

I O
counsel O
you O

inquired O
Auriol S-PERSON
, O
after O
a O
pause O
. O
“ O

the O

with O
a O
bitter O

The O

was O
then O
hushed O

and O
though O
Auriol S-PERSON
ad- O
dressed O
several O
other O

After O
some O
moments O
of O
irresolution O

Auriol S-PERSON
once O
more O
took O
up O
the O
pocket O

deposited O
it O
in O

He O
then O
opened O
the O

upon O
the O

found O
its O
contents O

Placing O
it O
with O

“ O

” O
This O
done O
, O
he O
went O
into O
the O
adjoining O

, O
casting O
his O
eyes O
about O

remarked O
the O
antique O
bottle O

not O
to O

seizing O
the O
cup O
with O
despera- O

he O
placed O
it O
to O
his O
lips O

emptied O

at O

draught O

All O

him O

in O
their O

Surrendering O
himself O
delightedly O
to O
their O

, O
he O
sank O
upon O
a O
couch O
, O
and O
for O
some O
time O
was O
wrapped O
in O
a O
dreamy O
elysium O
, O
imagining O
himself O
wandering O
with O
Edith B-PERSON
Talbot E-PERSON
in O
a O
lovely O
garden O
, O
redolent O
of O
sweets O
, O
and O
vocal O
with O
the O
melody O
of O
birds O
. O
Their O
path O
led O
through O
a O
grove O
, O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
which O
was O
a O
fountain O

they O
were O
hastening O
towards O
its O
marble O
brink O
, O
when O
all O
at O
once O
Edith S-PERSON
uttered O
a O
scream O
, O
and O
, O
starting O
back O
, O
pointed O
to O
a O
large O
black O
snake O
lying O
before O
her O
, O
and O
upon O
which O
she O
would O
have O
trodden O
the O
next O
moment O
. O
Auriol S-PERSON
sprang O
forward O
and O
tried O
w O
crush O
the O
reptile O
with O
his O
heel O

but O
, O
avoiding O
the O
blow O
, O
it O
coiled O
around O
his O
leg O
, O
and O
plunged O
its O
venom O
teeth O
into O
his O
flesh O
. O
The O
anguish O
occasioned O
by O
the O
imaginary O
wound O
roused O
him O
from O
his O
slumber O
, O
and O
looking O
up O
, O
he O
perceived O
that O
a O
servant O
was O
in O
attendance O
. O
Bowing O
obsequiously O
, O
the O
man O
inquired O
whether O
he O
had O
occasion O
for O
anything O
. O
“ O
Show O
me O
to O
my O
bedroom O

that O
is O
all O
I O

replied O
Auriol S-PERSON
, O
scarcely O
able O
to O
shake O
off O
the O
effect O
of O
the O
vision O

And O
, O
getting O
up O
, O
he O
followed O
the O
man O

almost O
mecha- O

on O
the B-TIME
following I-TIME
morning E-TIME

At O

, O
finding O
himself O
in O
a O
large O
and O
most O
luxuriantly O
- O
furnished O
chamber O
, O
he O
was O
at O
a O
loss O
to O
conceive O
how O
he O
came O
there O
, O
and O
it O
was O
some O
time O
before O
he O
could O
fully O
recal O
the O
mysterious O
events O
of O
the B-TIME
previous I-TIME
night E-TIME

As O
had O
been O
foretold O
, O
however O
, O
by O
hcugemont O
, O
his O
position O
did O
not O
cause O
him O
so O
much O
anxiety O
as O
before O
. O
After O
attiring O
himself O
, O
he O
descended O
to O
the O
lower O
apart- O
ments O
, O
in O
one O
of O
which O
a O
sumptuous O
breakfast O
awaited O
him O

and O
having O
partaken O
of O
it O
, O
he O
took O
a O
complete O
survey O
of O
the O
house O
, O
and O
found O
it O
larger O
and O
more O
magnificent O
even O
than O
he O
had O
supposed O
it O
. O
He O
next O
supplied O
himself O
from O
the O
pocket O
- O
book O
with O
a O
certain O
sum O
, O
for O
which O
he O
fancied O
he O
might O
have O
occasion O
in O
the O
course O
of O
the O
day O
, O
and O
sallied O
forth O
. O
His O
first S-ORDINAL
business O
was O
to O
procure O
a O
splendid O
carriage O

horses O

and O
to O
order O
some O
new O

rich O
habiliments O

be O
made O
with O
the O

He O
then O
proceeded O
towards O
May B-EVENT
Fair E-EVENT

and O
knocked O
at O
the O
door O
of O
a O
large O
house O
at O
the O
upper O
end O
of O
Curzon B-FAC

His O
heart O
beat O
violently O
as O
he O
was O
shown O
into O
an O
elegant O
drawing O

room O

and O
his O
trepidation O
momentarily O
increased O
, O
until O
the O
servant O
reappeared O
and O
expressed O
his O
regret O
that O
he O
had O
misinformed O
him O
in O
stating O
that O
Miss O

Auriol S-PERSON

incredulous O

but O
, O
without O
making O
any O
remark O
, O
departed O
Hurrying O
home O
, O
he O
wrote O
a O
few O
lines O
to O
Mr. O

, O
announcing O
the O
sudden O
and O
extraordinary O
change O

formally O

about O

a O
note O
was O
brought O
him O
by O
his O

was O
from O
Edith S-PERSON

Having O
ascertained O
his O
new O
address O

she O
wrote O

assure O
him O

Transported O
by O
this O

, O
Auriol S-PERSON
half O
devoured O
the O
note O
with O
kisses O

and O
instantly O
sent O
off O
his O
own O
letter O
to O
her O
father O
— O
merely O
adding O
a O
few O
words O

that O

would O
call O

an O
answer O
on O

But O
he O
had O
not O

long O

Ere O
an O
hour O
had O
elapsed O

Mr. O

brought O
it O
in O

. O
Mr. O

a O

about O
sixty O

which O
lent O
considerable O
expression O
to O
the O
orbs O
beneath O
them O
. O
His O
complexion O
was O
a O
bilious O
brown O

he O
possessed O
none O

upon O

to O
his O

from O

almond O

of O

black O

Thus O

all O

“ O

said O
Auriol S-PERSON

Edith S-PERSON
arose O
, O
and O
passing O
her O
arm O
under O
that O
of O
her O
hus- O
band O
, O
they O
quitted O
the O

, O
but O
in O
place O
of O
descending O
the O
principal O
staircase O
, O
they O
took O
a O
more O
private O
course O

The O
hall O
, O
which O
they O
were O
obliged O
to O
cross O
, O
and O
which O
they O
entered O
from O
a O
side O

door O
, O
was O
spacious O
and O
beautifully O
pro- O
portioned O
, O
and O
adorned O
with O
numerous O
statues O
on O
pedestals O
. O
The O
ceiling O
was O
decorated O
with O
fresco O

, O
and O
sup- O
ported O
by O
two S-CARDINAL
stately O
scagliola O

From O
between O
these O
, O
a O
broad O
staircase O
of O
white O
marble O
ascended O
to O
the O
upper O
room O
. O
As O
Auriol S-PERSON
had O
foreseen O
, O
the O
staircase O
was O
thronged O
with O
guests O
ascending O
to O
the O
ball O
- O
room O
, O
the O
doors O
of O
which O
being O
open O
, O
afforded O
glimpses O
of O
the O
dancers O
, O
and O
gave O
forth O
strains O
of O
liveliest O
music O
. O
Anxious O
to O
avoid O
a O
newly O
- O
arrived O
party O
in O
the O
hall O
, O
Auriol S-PERSON
and O
his O
bride O
lingered O
for O
a O
mo- O
ment O
near O
a O
pillar O
. O
“ O
Ha O
! O
who O
is O
this O
? O
” O
cried O
Edith S-PERSON
, O
as O
a O
tall O
man O
, O
with O
a O
sinister O
countenance O
, O
and O
habited O
entirely O
in O
black O
, O
moved O
from O
the O
farther O
side O
of O
the O
pillar O
, O
and O
planted O
himself O
in O
their O
path O
, O
with O
his O
back O
partly O
towards O
them O
. O
A O
thrill O
of O
apprehension O
passed O
through O
Auriol’s S-PRODUCT
frame O
. O
He O
looked O
up O
and O
beheld O
Rougemont S-PERSON
, O
who O
, O
glancing O
over O
his O
shoulder O
, O
fixed O
his O
malignant O
gaze O
upon O
him O
. O
Retreat O
was O
now O
impossible O
, O
“ O
You O
thought O
to O
delude O
me O
, O
” O
said O
Rougemont S-PERSON
, O
in O
deep O
whisper O
, O
audible O
only O
to O
Auriol S-PERSON

“ O

you O
counted O

“ O

” O
cried O
Edith S-PERSON
. O
“ O
Who O

this O
strange O
person O
? O
” O
But O
her O
husband O
returned O
no O
answer O

Terror O
had O
taken O
away O
his O
power O
of O

“ O

said O
Rougemont S-PERSON

advancing O
towards O
her O

taking O
her O
hand O
. O
“ O
You O

coming O

Auriol S-PERSON

” O
cried O
Edith S-PERSON
, O
who O
scarcely O
knew O
whether O
to O
draw O
back O
or O
go O
forward O
. O
“ O
Yes O
— O
yes O
, O
” O
cried O
Auriol S-PERSON
, O
who O
fancied O
he O
saw O
a O
means O
of O
escape O
. O
“ O
This O

“ O

“ O

“ O

“ O

In O
another O

they O
were O
at O
the O

The O
carriage O
was O
there O

its O
four S-CARDINAL
horses O

a O
man-servant O

in O
tra- O
velling O

stood O
beside O
the O
steps O

Reassured O
by O
the O
sight O
, O
Auriol S-PERSON
recovered O
his O
courage O
, O
and O
suffered O
Rouge- O
mont O
to O
throw O
a O
cloak O
over O
Edith’s S-PERSON
shoulders O
. O
The O
next O
moment O
she O
tripped O
up O
the O
steps O
of O
the O
carriage O
, O
and O
was O
ensconced O
within O
it O
. O
Auriol S-PERSON
was O
about O
to O
follow O
her O
, O
when O
he O
received O
a O
violent O
blow O
on O
the O
chest O
, O
which O
stretched O
him O
on O
the O
pavement O
. O
Before O
he O
could O
regain O
his O
feet O
, O
Rougemont S-GPE
had O
sprung O
into O
the O
carriage O
. O
The O
steps O
were O
instantly O
put O
up O
by O
the O
man-servant O
, O
who O
mounted O
the O
box O
with O
the O

celerity O

As O
the O

turned O
the O
corner O
of O
King B-FAC

, O
Auriol S-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
just O

the O
light O
of O
a O
lamp O
, O
Rougemont’s O
face O
at O
the O
window O
of O
the O
carriage O
, O
charged O
with O
an O
expression O
of O
the O
most O
fiendish O
triumph O
. O
“ O
What O

Mr. O

Auriol S-PERSON
, O
gloomily O
. O
“ O
What O

wretch O

” O
cried O
Mr. O
Talbot S-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
voice O
of O
distraction O
. O
‘ O
I O
heard O

‘“ O

Mr. O
Tuoryeycrorr S-PERSON
and O
his O
companions O
had O
scarcely O
gained O
a O
passage O
in O
the O
deserted O
house O
, O
which O
they O
had O
entered O
in O
the O
manner O
described O
in O
a O
previous O
chapter O
, O
when O
they O
were O
alarmed O
by O
the O
sudden O
and O
furious O
ringing O
of O
a O
bell O
overhead O
. O
The O
noise O
brought O
them O
instantly O
to O
a O
halt O
, O
and O
each O
man O
grasped O
his O
arms O
in O

ceasing O

all O
con- O

quiet O

they O
moved O
on O

presently O
reached O
a O
large O
hall O
with O
a O
lofty O
window O
over O
the O
door O
, O
which O
, O

afforded O

From O

four S-CARDINAL

‘ O

But O
without O
paying O
any O
attention O
to O
the O
inquiry O
, O
Reeks S-PERSON
quitted O
the O
room O
, O
and O
closed O
the O
door O
carefully O
after O
him O
. O
He O
next O
crossed O
the O
hall O
, O
and O
cautiously O
ascending O
a O
stair O
- O
case O
at O
the O
farther O
end O
of O
it O
, O
reached O
the O
landing O

place O

Beyond O

was O
a O
gallery O
, O
from O

several O
chambers O
opened O

THE O
CELL O

157 S-CARDINAL
Advancing O
a O
few O
paces O
, O
he O
listened O
intently O
, O
and O
hearing O
a O
slight O
sound O
in O
an O
apartment O
to O
the O
right O
, O
he O
stepped O
softly O
towards O
it O
, O
and O
placing O
his O
eye O
to O
the O
keyhole O
, O
beheld O
a O
tall O
man O
, O
dressed O
in O
black O
, O
pacing O
to O
and O
fro O
with O
rapid O
strides O
, O
while O
three S-CARDINAL
other O
persons O
, O
wrapped O
in O
sable O
gowns O
, O
and O
disguised O
with O
hideous O
masks O
, O
stood O
silent O
and O
motion O
- O
less O
at O
a O
little O
distance O
from O
him O
. O
In O
the O
tall O
man O
he O
recognised O
Cyprian B-PERSON
Rougemont E-PERSON
. O
Upon O
a O
table O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
room O
was O
laid O
a O
large O
open O
volume O
, O
bound O
in O
black O
vellum O
. O
Near O
it O
stood O
a O
lamp O
, O
which O
served O
to O
illu- O
mine O
the O
scene O
. O
Suddenly O
, O
Rougemont S-PERSON
stopped O
, O
and O
turning O
over O
several O
leaves O
of O
the O
book O
, O
which O
were O
covered O
with O
cabalistic O
characters O
, O
appeared O
in O
search O
of O
some O
magic O
formula O
. O
Before O
he O
could O
find O
it O
, O
however O
, O
a O
startling O
interruption O
occurred O
. O
An O
alarum O
- O
bell O
, O
fixed O
against O
the O
wall O
, O
began O
to O
ring O
, O
and O
at O
the O
same O
moment O
the O
doors O
of O
a O
cabinet O
flew O
open O
, O
and O
a O
large O
ape O
( O
for O
such O
it O
seemed O
to O
Reeks O
) O
, O
clothed O
in O
a O
woollen O
shirt O
and O
drawers O
, O
sprang O
forth O
, O
and O
bounding O
upon O
the O
table O
beside O
Rougemont S-GPE
, O
placed O
its O
mouth O
to O
his O
ear O
. O
The O
communication O
thus O
strangely O
made O
seemed O
highly O
displeasing O
to O
Rougemont S-PERSON
, O
who O
knitted O
his O
brows O
, O
and O
delivered O
some O
instructions O
in O
an O
under O
tone O
to O
the O
monkey O
. O
The O
animal O
nodded O
its O
head O
in O
token O
of O
obedience O
, O
jumped O
off O
the O
table O
, O
and O
bounded O
back O
to O
the O
cabinet O
, O
the O
doors O
of O
which O
closed O
as O
before O
. O
Rougemont S-PERSON
next O
took O
up O
the O
lamp O
, O
with O
the O
evident O
intention O
of O

seeing O

, O
Reeks S-PERSON
hastily O
retreated O
to O
an O
adjoining O
chamber O
, O
the O
door O
of O
which O
was O
fortunately O
open O
, O
and O
had O
scarcely O
gained O
its O
shelter O
when O
the O
four S-CARDINAL
mysteri- O
ous O
personages O
appeared O
on O
the O
gallery O
. O
Reeks O
heard O
their O
footsteps O
descending O
the O
staircase O
, O
and O
then O
, O
creeping O
cautiously O
after O
them O
, O
watched O
them O
across O
the O
hall O
, O
and O
pause O
before O
the O
chamber O
containing O
Mr. O
Thorneycroft S-PERSON
and O
his O
companions O
. O
After O
a O
moments’ O
deliberation O
, O
Rouge- S-PERSON
mont O
noiselessly O
locked O
the O
door O
, O
took O
out O
the O
key O
, O
and O
leaving O
two S-CARDINAL
of O
his O
attendants O
on O
guard O
, O
returned O
with O
the O
third S-ORDINAL
towards O
the O
staircase O
. O
Without O
tarrying O
to O
confront O
them O
, O
Reeks S-PERSON
started O
back O
, O
and O
hurried O
along O
the O
gallery O
till O
he O
came O
to O
a O
back O
stair O

where O
, O
after O
traversing O
one S-CARDINAL

two S-CARDINAL

, O
he O
entered O
a O
subterranean O
passage O
, O
arched O
overhead O

having O
several O
openings O
at O
the O
sides O
, O
apparently O
communicating O
with O
other O
passages O

It O
was O
lighted O
at O
intervals O
by O
lamps O
, O
which O
emitted O
a O
feeble O
radiance O
. O
By O
the O
light O
of O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
these O
, O
Reeks S-PERSON
discovered O
the O
door O
of O
a O
cell O
. O
It O
was O
of O
iron O
, O
and O
as O
he O
struck O
it O
with O
his O
hand O
, O
returned O
a O
hollow O
clangour O
. O
On O
repeating O
the O
blow O
, O
a O
hoarse O
voice O
from O

cried O

“ O

Mr. O

turning O
pale O
, O

trembling O
. O
‘ O
It O
sounds O
as O
if O

” O
The O
noise O
, O
which O
up O
to O
this O
moment O
had O
borne O
an O
indis- O
tinct O
resemblance O
to O
the O
creaking O
of O
wheels O
and O
pulleys O
, O
now O
increased O
to O
a O
violent O
clatter O
, O
while O
the O
house O
was O
shaken O
as O
if O
by O
the O
explosion O
of O
a O
mine O
beneath O
it O
. O
At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
the O
occupants O
of O
the O
chairs O
received O
a O
sharp O
electrical O
shock O
, O
that O
agitated O
every O
limb O
, O
and O
caused O
Mr. O
Thorneycroft S-PERSON
to O
let O
fall O
his O
pistol O
, O
which O
went O
off O
as O
it O
reached O
the O
ground O
. O
At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
the O
Sand- O
man O
dropped O
his O
goblet O
, O
and O
the O
Tinker S-PERSON
relinquished O
his O
grasp O
of O
the O
cutlass O
. O
Before O
they O
could O
recover O
from O
the O
shock O
, O
all O
three S-CARDINAL
were O
caught O
by O
stout O
wooden O
hooks O
, O
which O
, O
detaching O
themselves O
from O
the O
back O
of O
the O
chairs O
, O
pinioned O
their O
arms O
, O
while O
their O
legs O
were O
restrained O
by O
fetters O
, O
which O
sprang O
from O
the O
ground O
and O
clasped O
round O
their O
ankles O
, O
Thus O
fixed O
, O
they O
struggled O
vainly O
to O
get O
free O
. O
The O
chairs O
168 S-CARDINAL
. O
AURIOL S-PERSON
. O
seemed O
nailed O
to O
the O
ground O
, O
so O
that O
all O
efforts O
to O
move O
them O
proved O
futile O
. O
But O
the O
worst O
was O
to O
come O
. O
From O
the O
holes O
in O
the O
ceil- O
ing O
already O
alluded O
to O
, O
descended O
three S-CARDINAL
heavy O
bell O
- O
shaped O
helmets O
, O
fashioned O
like O
those O
worn O
by O
divers O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
sea O
, O
and O
haying O
round O
eyelet O
- O
holes O
of O
glass O
. O
It O
was O
evident O
, O
from O
the O
manner O
of O
their O
descent O
, O
that O
these O
helmets O
must O
drop O
on O
the O
heads O
of O
the O
sitters O
— O
a O
convic- O
tion O
that O
filled O
them O
with O
inexpressible O
terror O
. O
They O
shouted O
, O
and O
swore O
frightfully O
| | O
but O
their O
vociferations O
availed O
them O
nothing O
. O
» O
Down O
came O
the O
helmets O
, O
and O
the O
same O
moment O
, O
the O
monkey O
which O
had O
been O
seen O
by O
Reeks S-PERSON
issued O
from O
a O
cupboard O
at O
the O
top O
of O
a O
cabinet O
, O
and O
grinned O
and O
gibbered O
at O
them O
. O
Down O
came O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
helmet O
, O
and O
covered O
the O
Tinker S-PRODUCT
to O
the O
shoulders O
. O
His O
appearance O
was O
at O
once O
ludicrous O
and O
terrible O
, O
and O
his O
roaring O
within O
the O
casque O
sounded O
like O
the O
bellowing O
of O
a O
baited O
bull O
. O
Down O
came O
the O
second S-ORDINAL
helmet O
, O
though O
rather O
more O
slowly O
, O
and O
the O
Sandman S-PERSON
was O
eclipsed O
in O
the O
same O
manner O
as O
the O
Tinker S-PRODUCT
, O
and O
roared O
as O
loudly O
. O
e O
In O
both O
these O
instances O
the O
helmets O
had O
dropped O
without O
guidance O
, O
but O
in O
the O
case O
of O
Mr. O
Thorneycroft S-PERSON
, O
a O
hand O
, O
thrust O
out O
of O
the O
hole O
in O
the O
ceiling O
, O
held O
the O
helmet O
sus- O
pended O
over O
his O
head O
, O
like O
the O
sword O
of O

, O
clinging O

stood O
with O

climax O

He O
was O
, O
however O
, O
soon O
roused O
by O
a O
pull O
at O
his O
hair O
, O
while O
a O
shrill O
voice O
called O
him O

“ O

The O

gone O
from O
his O

in O
its O

was O
seen O
the O
handsome O

resolute O

of O
a O
man O
of O

He O
held O

coming O
up O

the O
moment O
behind O

he O
discharged O
a O

with O
a O
deliberate O

“ O

But O
before O

could O
draw O
the O

the O

were O
wrested O
from O

the O

had O
quitted O

THE O
PIT O

So O
bewildered O
was O
the O
poor O
iron O

by O
the O
strange O

terrible O
events O
that O

Gerard B-PERSON
Paston E-PERSON
, O
he O
felt O
utterly O
incapable O
of O

would O
probably O
have O
made O
no O
effort O
to O
regain O
his O
freedom O

if O
his O
coat O
had O
not O
been O
vigorously O
plucked O
behind O

while O
a O
low O
voice O
urged O
him O
to O
fly O

Glancing O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
the O
friendly O
speaker O
, O
he O
could O
just O
discern O
a O
diminutive O
object O
standing O
within O
the O
entrance O
of O
a O
side O
- O
passage O
, O
and O
reared O
up O
against O
the O
wall O
so O
as O
to O
be O
out O
of O
sight O
of O
Rougemont S-PERSON
and O
his O
attendants O
. O
It O
was O
the O
monkey O
— O
or O
rather O
Old O
Parr S-PERSON
— O
who O
, O
continuing O
to O
tug O
violently O
at O
his O
coat O
, O
at O
last O
succeeded O
in O
drawing O
him O
backwards O
into O
the O
passage O

and O
then O
grasping O
his O
bend O
tightly O
, O
hurried O
him O
along O
it O
. O
The O
passage O
was O
THE O
PIT O

179 S-CARDINAL
wholly O
unlighted O
, O
but O
Mr. O
Thorneycroft S-PERSON
could O
perceive O
that O
it O
was O
exceedingly O
circuitous O
, O
and O
winded O
round O
like O
a O
maze O
. O
“ O
Where O
are O
you O
taking O
me O

” O
he O
inquired O

“ O
Ask O
no O

rejoined O
the O

pulling O
him O
along O

“ O
Do O
you O
want O
to O
be O

the O
rest O

” O
“ O
Certainly O
not O

replied O
Thorneycroft S-PERSON
, O
accelerating O
his O

“ O

“ O
There’s O

“ O
If O

“ O
Oh O

I O

groaned O
the O
iron O

“ O
T O

the O

“ O

” O
And O
as O
he O
spoke O
, O
shouts O
, O

the O
noise O
of O
rapidly O

approaching O
footsteps O

resounded O
along O
the O
passage O

“ O

gasped O

cried O
the O

taunt- O
ingly O

“ O

it O

“ O

“ O
Did O

as O

a O

thrust O
down O

, O
grasping O
the O

by O
the O
nape O
of O

drew O

Well O

nigh O
stifled O
by O
the O
thickening O
and O
pungent O
vapour O
, O
the O
poor O
iron O

merchant O
found O
compliance O
impos- O
sible O
. O
Before O
he O
could O
reach O
the O
dwarf O
, O
the O
little O
fellow O
was O
184 S-CARDINAL
AUBIOL O

earried O
off O
. O
Left O
to O
himself O
, O
Mr. O
Thorneycroft S-PERSON
staggered O
along O
the O
passage O
, O
expecting O
every O
moment O
to O
drop O
, O
until O
at O
length O
a O
current O
of O
fresh O
air O
blew O
in O
his O
face O
, O
and O
enabled O
him O
to O
breathe O
more O
freely O
. O
Somewhat O
revived O
, O
he O
went O
on O
, O
but O
with O
great O
deliberation O
, O
and O
it O
was O
well O
he O
did O
so O
, O
for O
he O
suddenly O
arrived O
at O
the O
brink O
of O
a O
pit O
about B-QUANTITY
eight I-QUANTITY
feet E-QUANTITY
in O
depth O
, O
into O
which O
, O
if O
he O
had O
approached O
it O
incautiously O
, O
he O
must O
infallibly O
have O
stumbled O
, O
and O
in O
all O
probability O
have O
broken O
his O
neck O

This O
pit O
evidently O
com- O
municated O
with O
a O
lower O
range O
of O
chambers O
, O
as O
was O
shown O
by O
a O
brazen O
lamp O
burning O
under O
an O
archway O
. O
A O
ladder O
was O
planted O
at O
one S-CARDINAL
side O
, O
and O
by O
this O
Mr. O

descended O
, O
but O
scarcely O
had O
he O
set O
foot O
on O
the O

than O
he O
felt O
himself O
rudely O
grasped O
by O
a O
man O

stepped O
from O
under O
the O
archway O

The O
next O
moment O
, O
however O

he O
was O
released O

while O
the O
familiar O
voice O
of O
the O

ex- O

“ O

So O

he O

few O
moments O

ducing O
a O

handed O
it O
to O
the O

“ O

he O
said O

Without O
a O

hesitation O
Auriol S-PERSON
complied O

“ O

” O
Like O
one S-CARDINAL
in O
a O
dream O
, O
Auriol S-PERSON
followed O
his O
conductor O
down O
the O
flight O
of O
stone O
steps O
leading O
from O
the O
dungeon O
, O
and O
along O
a O
narrow O
passage O

proceeded O

he O

stealthy O

never O
turned O
his O
head O
, O
to O
see O
whether O
he O
was O
really O
followed O
. O
In O
this O
way O
they O
reached O
a O
short O
steep O
staircase O
, O
and O
, O
mounting O
it O
, O
entered O
a O
vault O
, O
in O
which O
Rougemont S-GPE
paused O
, O
and O
placed O
the O
torch O

had O
brought O
with O
him O
upon O
the O
floor O
. O
Its O
lurid O
glimmer O
partially O
illumined O
the O
chamber O
, O
and O
showed O
that O
it O
was O
built O
of O
stone O
. O
Rude O
benches O
of O
antique O
form O
were O
set O
about O
the O

motioning O
Auriol S-PERSON
to O
be O
seated O
upon O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
them O
, O
Rougemont S-PERSON
sounded O
a O
silver O
whistle O
. O
The O
summons O
was O
shortly O
afterwards O
answered O
by O
the O
dwarf O
, O
in O
whose O
attire O
a O
new O
change O
had O
taken O
place O

He O
was O
now O
clothed O
in O
a O
jerkin O
of O
grey O
serge O
, O
fashioned O
like O
the O
garments O
worn O
by O
the O
common O
people O
in O
Elizabeth's S-PERSON
reign O
, O
and O
wore O
a O
trencher O

cap O
on O
his O
head O
. O
Auriol S-PERSON
watched O
him O
as O
he O
timidly O
advanced O
towards O
Rougemont S-GPE
, O
and O
had O
an O
indistinct O
recollection O
of O

seen O
him O
before O

could O
not O

“ O

he O

Auriol S-PERSON

the O

the O

what O
seemed O
a O

He O
also O

Peasant O

there O

something O
of O
grandeur O

majesty O

this O
old O
man’s O

physiognomy O

His O
head O
declined O
backwards O
, O
so O
as O
completely O
to O
expose O
his O
long O
and O
muscular O

His O

hung O
listlessly O

one S-CARDINAL

The O
old O

garb O
was O
of O
the O
coarsest O

he O
wore O
little O

His O

, O
however O

was O
above O
his O

he O
became O
his O

proudly O
as O
a O

have O

his O
ermined O

The O
more O
I O
scrutinised O
the O
rigid O

of O
this O
old O

the O

perhaps O
not O

no O

His O

his O

he O

The O

the O

their O

around O

that O
the O

would O
I O
not O

I O
felt O

it O

I O

laid O
my O

with O
some O

upon O
his O

The O

started O
at O
the O

turned O

Now O
, O
indeed O
, O
his O

were O
opened O

flashing O
full O
upon O

such O

Heretofore O
I O
had O
only O
dreamed O

I O
quailed O
beneath O
the O
fierce O

he O
threw O
upon O

But O
if O
Iwas O
, O
at O
first S-ORDINAL

surprised O
at O
the O
display O
of O
anger O
which O
I O
had O
called O
forth O
in O
him O
, O
how O
much O
more O
was O
I O
astonished O

behold O
the O

His O

continued O
fixed O
upon O
mine O

if O

Apparently O
he O
could O
not O
avert O
them O

while O
his O
whole O
frame O
shivered O
with O
emotion O
. O
I O
advanced O
towards O
him O

he O
shrank O
backwards O
, O
and O
, O
but O
for O
the O
timely O
aid O
of O
his O
companion O
, O
would O
have O
fallen O

At O
a O
loss O

conceive O

I O
could O
have O
occa- O

his O

thrust O
his O

as O
if O
to O
seek O
for O
means O

prevent O
further O

Meanwhile O
the O
group O
had O
been O
increased O
by O
the O
arrival O
of O
a O
third S-ORDINAL

attracted O
by O
the O

the O

He O
was O
hastening O

he O
suddenly O
stopped O
, O
and O
was O
about O
to O
retire O
when O
he O
encoun- O
tered O
my O
gaze O

As O
our O

met O
he O
started O

and O
a O
terror O
, O
as O
sudden O

lively O
as O
that O
exhibited O
by O
the O
old O
man O

was O
at O
once O
depicted O

My O

now O
beyond O

and O
I O
continued O
for O
some O
moments O
speechless O
with O
astonishment O

Not O
a O

of O
the O

which O
affected O
the O

the O
stranger O
was O
communicated O
to O
myself O
. O
Alto O
- O
gether O
, O
we O
formed O
a O
mysterious O
and O
terrible O
triangle O
, O
of O
which O
each O
side O
bore O
some O
strange O
and O
unintelligible O
rela- O

to O
the O
other O
. O
The O
new O
comer O
first S-ORDINAL
recovered O
his O
composure O
, O
though O
not O
without O
an O
effort O
. O
Coldly O
turning O
his O
heel O
upon O
me O
, O
he O
walked O
towards O
the O
old O
man O

shook O
him O
forcibly O
. O
The O
latter O
shrank O
from O
his O
grasp O
, O
and O
endeavoured O
to O
avoid O
him O

but O
it O
was O
impossible O

The O

whispered O
a O
few O

of O
which O
, O
from O
his O

I O
could O
guess O
the O

The O
old O

replied O

His O
action O
in O
doing O
so O
was O
that O
of O
supplication O

The O

retorted O
in O
a O
wild O

vehement O
manner O

even O
stamped O
upon O

the O

“ O

No O

the O

the O
entrance O

To O

Scarcely O

All O
my O

I O
remained O

“ O

felt O
the O

over O

my O

we O
trod O

its O
elastic O
turf O

At O
length O
they O
came O
to O
a O
halt O

My O
bandage O
was O
re- O
moved O

I O
beheld O
myself O
beneath O
the O
arch O

an O

Around O

the O

had O

within O

They O
greeted O
my O

on O
their O
arrival O

and O
glanced O
inquisitively O
at O
me O
, O
but O
did O
not O
speak O
to O
me O
. O
The O
elder O
Calabrian S-PERSON

whom O
they O
addressed O

asked O
for O

I O

upon O
me O

“ O
You O
will O

it O
, O

“ O
you O

he O

off O

I O

I O

I O
sighed O

“ O

I O

“ O

her O

down O

that O

The O
animal O
snatched O
the O
glove O
from O
her O

, O
and O
, O
as O
he O
bounded O
backwards O
, O
fell O
over O
the O

My O

uttered O
a O

at O

I O

preparing O

restored O
her O

received O

From O
that O

an O
in- O

then O
, O
resting O
her O

her O
white O

rounded O

a O

the O

a O
breathless O

only O
a O

He O

aloud O
