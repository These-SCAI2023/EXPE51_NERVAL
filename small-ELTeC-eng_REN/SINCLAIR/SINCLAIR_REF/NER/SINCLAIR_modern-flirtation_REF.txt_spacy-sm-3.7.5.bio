PREFACE O
. O
| 
  | O
It O
was O
the O
rule O
of O
a O
celebrated O
equestrian O
, O
which O
might O
be O
adapted O
to O
authors O
as O
well O
as O
to O
|
     | O
horsemen O
, O
that O
every O
one O
should O
ride O
as O
if O
he O
expected O
to O
be O
thrown O
, O
and O
drive O
as O
if O
he O
|
     | O
expected O
to O
be O
upset O

Impunity O
in O
publishing O
, O
far O
from O
rendering O
an O
author O
presumptuous O
, O
should O
|
     | O
tend O
rather O
to O
increase O
his O
timidity O
, O
the O
danger O
being O
greater O
always O
of O
venturing O
too O
much O
, O
|
     | O
than O
of O
hazarding O
too O
little O
  O
and O
the O
more O
cause O
any O
writer O
has O
to O
feel O
grateful O
for O
the O
|
     | O
lenient O
judgment O
of O
an O
enlightened O
public O
, O
the O
more O
circumspect O
should O
he O
become O
, O
not O
to O
|
     | O
trespass O
by O
an O
obtrusive O
reappearance O
on O
that O
notice O
which O
has O
already O
perhaps O
been O
, O
as O
in O
|
     | O
respect O
to O
the O
author O
herself O
, O
beyond O
all O

An O
old O
proverb O
declares O
that O
" O
a O
goose O
- O
quill O
is O
more O
powerful O
than O
a O
lion O
's O
claw O
, O
" O
and O
authors O
|
     | O
have O
been O
called O
" O
keepers O
of O
the O
public O
conscience O
  O
" O
but O
no O
influence O
is O
perhaps O
so O
extensive O
|
     | O
as O
that O
exercised O
by O
what O
is O
termed O
" O
light O
reading O
, O
" O
which O
has O
now O
in O
a O
great O
measure O
|
     | O
superseded O
public O
places O
and O
theatrical O
entertainments O

affording O
a O
popular O

with O
which O
|
     | O
the O
busiest O
men O
relax O
their O
hard O

working O
minds O
, O
and O
the O
idlest O
occupy O
their O
idleness O
. O
It O
|
     | O
becomes O
a O
deep O
responsibility O
, O
therefore O
, O
of O
which O
the O
author O
trusts O
she O
has O
ever O
felt O
duly O

     | O
sensible O

to O
claim O
the B-TIME

the O

of O
sound O

supported O
, O
for O
her O
feelings O
are O
best O
expressed O
in O
the O
words O
of O
the O
poet O
, O

" O

reading O
, O
formerly O
considered O
the O
lowest O
resource O
of O

vacuity O
, O
has O

     | O
lately O
promoted O
to O
a O
new O
place O
in O
the O
literary O
world O
, O
since O
men O
of O
the O
brightest O
genius O
as O
well O
|
     | O
as O
of O
the O
highest O
attainments O
in O
learning O
and O
philosophy O
, O
allow O
their O
pens O
occasionally O
to O
|
     | O
wander O
in O
the O
attractive O
regions O
of O
fiction O
  O
therefore O
works O
of O
imagination O
, O
no O
longer O
merely O
a O

     | O
clandestine O
amusement O
to O
frivolous O
minds O
, O
are O
now O

read O

enjoyed O

to O
beguile O
an O
idle O

hour O

to O
cheer O
a O
gloomy O
one O
, O
by O
men O
of O
science O
, O
of O
wisdom O
, O
and O
of O
piety O

Such O
is O
the O
general O

     | O
encouragement O
given O
now O
to O
works O
of O
fancy O
, O
that O
, O
as O
the O
literary O
existence O
of O
authors O
depends O
|
     | O
on O
attracting O
readers O
, O
there O
will O
scarcely O
be O
encouragement O
enough O
soon O
to O
induce O
historians O

     | O
and O
biographers O
to O
dip O
the O
pen O
of O
veracity O
into O
the O
ink O
of O
retrospection O
, O
while O
it O
is O
perhaps O

     | O
to O
be O
lamented O
that O

certain O

a O
very O
short O
period O

for O
no O

     | O
more O

few O
authors O

themselves O
time O
to O
aspire O
at O
the O
highest O
grade O

imaginary O

     | O
composition O

When O
such O
volumes O
are O
really O
true O
to O
nature O
, O
they O
convey O
very O
important O
truths O
in O

     | O
a O
form O
more O
popular O
than O
a O
dry O

volume O
of O
moral O
precepts O

and O
perhaps O
history O
itself O

     | O
can O
scarcely O
afford O
so O
graphic O
a O
portrait O

In O
writing O
a O
story O
of O
domestic O
life O
, O
it O
is O
singular O
to O
reflect O
how O
commonly O
men O
are O

     | O
remembered O
by O
their O
eccentricities O

loved O

very O
faults O

while O
the O
most O
difficult O

     | O
task O
in O

is O
, O
to O
describe O
amiable O

as O
to O
render O
them O
at O
all O
interesting O

not O

     | O
utterly O
insipid O
. O
Probably O
it O
may O
be O
for O
this O
reason O
that O
modern O
writers O
too O
frequently O
, O
instead O
|
     | O
of O
describing O
the O
principles O

human O
nature O
, O
and O
the O
sentiments O
which O
embellish O

painted O
in O
vivid O

all O
that O
is O
low O

mean O

and O
vicious O

     | O
and O
flinging O

such O
a O

Even O

such O

simple O
explanation O

the O

a O
certain O
conviction O
in O
closing O

that O

can O
never O

The O
mothers O

of O
late O
been O
so O
harshly O

the O

that O
it O
seems O

some O

up O

the O
weight O

Sir O

kindly O

The O

mischievous O
boys O
at O
Eton B-ORG

     | O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
Dunbar I-PERSON
and O
Louis B-PERSON
De I-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
, O
who O
astonished O
the O
weak O
minds O
of O
masters O
and O
pupils O
, O
|
     | O
by O
the O
strange O
and O
startling O
invention O
displayed O
in O
their O
exploits O
, O
as O
well O
as O
by O
the O
ingenuity O

     | O
with O
which O
both O
got O
safely O
out O
of O
every O
threatening O
predicament O
, O
and O
the O
sly O
humor O
or O
cunning O
|
     | O
with O
which O
they O
frequently O
shifted O
the O
disgrace O

or O
even O
the O
punishment O
, O
of O
their O
offences O
, O
on O

     | O
others O
who O
deserved O
it O
less O
, O
or O
perhaps O
not O
at O
all O
. O
Invariably O
at O
the O
head O
of O
every O
mad O

     | O
exploit O

or O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
every O

, O
how O
they O
could O
possibly O
have O
escaped O
being O
|
     | O
expelled O
was O
a O
frequent O
topic O
of O
subsequent O
wonder O
among O
their O
contemporaries O
in O
the O
classes O
  O
|
     | O
but O
their O
delight O
was O
to O
run O
as O
near O
the O
wind O
as O
possible O
, O
and O
still O
to O
display O
their O
skilful O

     | O
pilotage O
by O
baffling O
justice O
, O
and O
evading O
the O

always O

rather O
to O

nothing O

When O
very O
young O
, O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
enterprising O
friends O
, O
both O

gazetted O
into O
the O
15th B-ORDINAL
Light B-WORK_OF_ART

Huzzars I-WORK_OF_ART
, O
had O
shown O
an O
early O
predilection O
for O
military O
life O
, O
by O
frequently O
escaping O
to O
the O
|
     | O
neighbouring O
barracks O
, O
assisted O
by O
a O
ladder O
of O
rope O
on O
which O
they O
descended O
every B-TIME
night I-TIME
from O
|
     | O
the O
windows O
. O
A O
gay O
, O
joyous O
reception O
invariably O
awaited O
these O
lively O
boys O
at O
the O
mess O
- O
table O
, O
|
     | O
where O
they O
sung O
many O
a O
jovial O
song O
, O
and O
cracked O
many O
a O
merry O
jest O
over O
their O
claret O
, O
till O
, O
|
     | O
after O
some B-TIME
hours I-TIME
spent O
in O
rapturous O
festivity O
, O
they O
stole O
silently O
back O
within O
bounds O
, O
and O
were O
|
     | O
re O
- O
admitted O
at O
the O
window O
, O
by O
their O
respective O
fags O
, O
who O
had O
received O
orders O
, O
under O
pain O
of O

     | O
death O
, O
to O
keep O
awake O
and O
answer O
their O
signals O
for O
the O
ladder O
by O
instantly O
lowering O
it O
. O
The O
|
     | O
spirits O
of O
both O
these O
young O
companions O
were O
more O
like O
the O
effect O
of O
intoxication O
, O
than O
mere O
|
     | O
sober O
enjoyment O
  O
and O
, O
on O
one B-CARDINAL
occasion O
, O
they O
set O
the O
table O
in O
a O
roar O
, O
by O
having O
a O
rivalship O
|
     | O
which O
would O
best O
imitate O
the O
gradual O
progress O
of O
becoming O
tipsy O
, O
though O
drinking O
nothing O
but O
|
     | O
cold O
water O
  O
in O
which O
exhibition O
they O
showed O
so O
much O
talent O
for O
mimicry O
, O
taking O
off O
the O
|
     | O
surrounding O
officers O
before O
their O
faces O
, O
and O
making O
so O
many O
home O
- O
thrusts O
and O
personal O
remarks O
, O
|
     | O
that O
the O
scene O
was O
never O
afterwards O
forgotten O
in O
the O
regiment O
. O
On O
another O
occasion O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
|
     | O
caused O
himself O
to O
be O
placed O
in O
a O
coffin O
, O
stolen O
from O
the O
undertakers O
, O
and O
was O
carried O
through O
|
     | O
the O
barracks O
by O
his O
companions O
, O
who O
made O
paper O
trumpets O
with O
which O
they O
played O
the O
dead O
march O
|
     | O
in O
Saul B-PERSON
, O
while O
all O
the O
sentries O
saluted O
as O
they O
passed O
. O
Such O
juvenile O
exploits O
in O
the O
dawn O
of O
|
     | O
life O
were O
now O
the O
subject O
of O
many O
a O
laughing O
reminiscence O
, O
and O
had O
been O
followed O
by O
others O
on O
a O
|
     | O
more O
extended O
scale O
and O
of O
more O
matured O
enterprise O
, O
at O
Mr. O
Brownlow B-PERSON
's O
, O
a O
private O
tutor O
, O
where O
|
     | O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
young O
men O
afterwards O
distinguished O
themselves O
in O
a O
way O
not O
easily O
to O
be O
forgotten O
, O
|
     | O
causing O
their O
better O
disciplined O
companions O
to O
wonder O
, O
though O
in O
very O
few O
instances O
to O
|
     | O
admire O
. O

In O
the O
favorite O
aristocratic O
achievements O
of O
driving O
stage O

coaches O

breaking O
lamps O
, O
wringing O

     | O
off O
knockers O
, O
assaulting O
watchmen O
, O
with O
other O
fistic O
and O
pugilistic O
exploits O
, O
they O
were O
nearly O
|
     | O
unrivalled O
  O
and O
occasionally O
their O
genius O
had O
soared O
into O
an O
extraordinary O
display O
of O
|
     | O
dexterity O
, O
in O
transposing O
the O
signs O
suspended O
over O
shops O

and O
in O
filching O
silk O
handkerchiefs O

     | O
from O
the O
pockets O
of O
their O
friends O
, O
merely O
as O
amateurs O
, O
but O
still O
the O
deed O
was O
done O
, O
and O
the O
|
     | O
laugh O
raised O
literally O
at O
the O
expense O
of O
the O
sufferer O
, O
as O
the O
plunder O
was O
retained O
to O
be O
a O
|
     | O
future O
trophy O
of O
success O
. O
Each O
successive O
stage O
of O
their O
youth O
, O
in O
short O
, O
supplied O
an O
|
     | O
inexhaustible O
fund O
of O
standing O
jests O
and O
lively O
anecdotes O
, O
the O
wit O
of O
which O
mainly O
consisted O
in O
|
     | O
their O
mischief O
, O
while O
they O
betrayed O
an O
utter O
recklessness O
about O
the O
opinions O
or O
the O
feelings O
of O
|
     | O
others O
, O
till O
at O
length O
the O
patience O
of O
their O
unfortunate O
private O
tutor O
was O
so O
completely O
|
     | O
exhausted O
that O
he O
gave O
them O
a O
secret O
hint O
to O
withdraw O
, O
which O
they O
accordingly O
lost O
no O
time O
in O
|
     | O
preparing O
to O
do O
, O
but O
not O
till O
they O
had O
enjoyed O
a O
very O
characteristic O
revenge O
. O
When O
Mr. O
Brownlow B-PERSON

     | O
had O
taken O
a O
party O
of O
friends O
with O
him O
one O
evening O
to O
the O
theatre O
, O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
suddenly O

     | O
discharged O
from O
the O
gallery O
the O
whole O
contents O
of O
a O
prodigious O
bag O
of O

coats O
, O
in O
the O
pit O
, O
perfectly O
white O
, O
and O
caused O
an O
uproar O
of O
anger O
and O
of O

     | O
irresistible O
laughter O
throughout O
the O
house O

where O
a O
panic O

struck O

speedily O
assembled O
by O
the O
alarming O
report O
that O
the O
reverend O
gentleman O
had O
committed O

     | O
suicide O
. O
A O
strict O
investigation O
took O
place O
respecting O
the O
authors O
of O
these O
unpardonable O
tricks O
, O

     | O
but O
, O

suspicion O
fell O
at O

upon O
the O
real O
culprits O

the O
circumstantial O
evidence O

     | O
against O

seemed O
irresistibly O
strong O

Sir O

argued O
his O

cause O
with O
so O
much O
skill O

and O
vivacity O

were O

not O
honorably O

     | O
acquitted O

Mr. O

having O
, O
it O
was O
conjectured O
, O
entertained O
some O
|
     | O
suspicion O
that O
the O
title O

were O
not O
perfectly O
valid O
, O
as O
an O
entail O
had O
been O
discovered O

     | O
afterwards O
, O
by O
which O
it O
was O
generally O
thought O
that O
the O
land O
must O
be O
restored O
to O
the O
original O

     | O
owner O
, O
he O
hastily O
and O
most O
unfairly O
sold O
the O
property O
to O
the O
late O
Mr. O
Granville B-PERSON
for O
£ O
350,000 B-MONEY
, O

     | O
and O
dying O
intestate O
, O
after O
having O
lost O
nearly O
the O
whole O
sum O
in O
a O
mining O
speculation O
, O
it O
could O
|
     | O
not O
be O
proved O
whether O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON

father O
had O
acted O
as O
an O
executor O
for O
the O
deceased O

not O

so O

     | O
as O

render O
himself O

liable O

refund O
the O
sum O
paid O

Granville O

Thus O
, O
whether O
the O
entail O
held O
good O

carried O
the O
estate O
back O
to O
Lord O

whether O
it O

broken O

as O

entitle O
the O
Granville B-PERSON
family O

or O

     | O
whether O
, O
if O
it O

the O
price O
could O
be O
claimed O
from O
the O
heirs O

Mr. O

     | O
continued O

to O
be O
solved O

  | O
For O
many O
generations O
past O
, O
the O
ancient O
Marquisate B-ORG

had O
been O
inherited O
by O
a O

     | O
succession O
of O
only O
sons O

all O
strict O
Papists B-NORP

had O
each O
in O

been O
reckoned O
by O
the O
next O

     | O
heirs O
exceedingly O
sickly O
and O
unpromising O
, O
but O
still O
the O
wonder O
grew O
, O
for O
not O
one O
had O
ever O
died O
, O
|
     | O
till O
he O
left O
a O
substitute O
in O
regular O
rotation O
, O
to O
supply O
the O
vacancy O
which O
he O
created O
himself O
  O

     | O
and O
a O
long O
train O
of O
minorities O
in O
the O
family O

caused O
the O
accumulation O
of O
wealth O

property O

     | O
to O
be O
enormous O
, O
when O
the O

succeeded O
fifty B-DATE
years I-DATE
before O
our O
story O
commences O
. O
|
     | O
Nothing O
could O
exceed O
his O
own O
astonishment O
at O
the O
unembarrassed O
magnificence O
of O
the O
fortune O
, O
of O
|
     | O
which O
he O
most O
unexpectedly O
found O
himself O
in O
possession O
, O
as O
his O
father O
had O
been O
in O
the O
habit O
of O

     | O
concealing O
the O
amount O
of O
his O

, O
and O
allowing O
his O

rather O
less O
than O
nothing O
, O

     | O
saying O
, O
that O
as O
he O
himself O

never O

anything O
to O

till O
he O
had O
no O
teeth O

he O

     | O
was O
resolved O
that O
his O
successor O
should O
be O
similarly O
treated O
. O
In O
pursuance O
of O
this O
plan O
, O
the O
old O

     | O
nobleman O
even O
on O
his O
death O
- O
bed O

had O
actually O
expired O
with O
a O
practical O
joke O
on O
his O
lips O
. O
He O
sent O
|
     | O
for O
his O
son O
, O
gravely O
told O
him O
that O
with O
debts O

, O
the O
very O
encumbered O

was O
about O
to O
inherit O
would O
scarcely O
pay O
its O
own O

recommended O
him O
to O
live O

     | O
in O
future O
with O
the O
most O
penurious O
economy O

When O
the O
will O
was O
opened O

finding O
to O
his O
unutterable O

     | O
joy O
, O
that O
he O
had O
merely O
been O
played O
upon O
by O
the O
old O
humorist O

in O

left O
him O
£ O

     | O
per O

clear O
, O
so O
great O
was O
Lord O

that O

almost O

it O
might O
have O

supposed O

that O
he O
never O
afterwards O

     | O
completely O
believed O
it O

as O
his O
personal O
expenses O
were O
always O
in O
a O
style O
more O
suited O
to O
the O
old O

     | O
Lord O

threat O

his O
performance O

he O
became O
a O
fresh O
instance O
of O
what O
may O
be O
so O
often O

     | O
remarked O

that O
the O

The O
life O
of O
Louis B-PERSON

, O
from O
the B-TIME
hour I-TIME

whatever O

they O
could O
be O
courted O
, O
or O
at O
|
     | O
whatever O
expense O
they O
could O
be O
enjoyed O
. O
At O
a O
very O
early O
age O
, O
he O
was O
already O
a O
veteran O
in O
the O
|
     | O
world O
and O
its O
ways O
  O
for O
he O
stood O
" O
alone O
in O
his O
glory O
, O
" O
the O
most O
admired O
, O
courted O
, O
and O
idolized O
|
     | O
of O
mankind O
, O
a O
perfect O
adept O
in O
all O
the O
arts O
of O
rendering O
himself O
agreeable O
in O
society O
, O
and O
|
     | O
possessing O
many O
pleasant O
qualities O
, O
but O
none O
that O
were O
valuable O
. O
During O
a O
gay O
career O
of O
|
     | O
dissipation O
and O
frivolity O
, O
he O
had O
entered O
with O
successive O
eagerness O
on O
a B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
flirtations O
, O
|
     | O
though O
he O
always O
forgot O
to O
marry O
in O
the O
end O
, O
while O
his O
heart O
, O
like O
a O
phœnix O
, O
was O
frequently O
|
     | O
consumed O
, O
yet O
never O
destroyed O
, O
and O
always O
ready O
at O
the O
service O
of O
any O
young O
lady O
, O
with O
youth O
, O
|
     | O
beauty O
, O
and O
accomplishments O
enough O
to O
excite O

temporary O
interest O

opinion O
, O
that O
, O

     | O

ought O
speedily O

one O
, O
young O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
openly O
avowed O
the O
|
     | O
impossibility O
of O
marrying O
while O
Lord B-PERSON
Doncaster I-PERSON
survived O
, O
and O
jocularly O
remarked O
, O
that O
it O
would O
|
     | O
be O
a O
pity O
prematurely O
to O
cut O
off O
the O
hopes O
of O
his B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
and I-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
Scotch B-NORP
cousins O
, O
who O
lived O
, O
|
     | O
like O
Ernest B-PERSON
Anstruther I-PERSON
, O
on O
the O
hope O
, O
that O
if O
his O
neck O
were O
broken O
at O
Melton B-ORG
, O
his O
succession O
|
     | O
might O
yet O
be O
" O
cut O
up O
" O
amongst O
them O
  O
and O
to O
the O
friendly O
inquiries O
of O
his O
many O
relatives O
, O
he O
|
     | O
frequently O
replied O
with O
a O
condoling O
look O
, O
that O
he O
and O
his O
uncle O
were O
both O
" O
hopelessly O

     | O
well O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Lord B-WORK_OF_ART

was O
not O
even O
yet O
, O
by O
any O
means O
, O
so O
great O
a O
Methusalemite B-LANGUAGE
in O
age O
, O
nor O
so O

     | O
weighed O
down O
by O
infirmities O
, O
as O
his O
lively O
nephew O
chose O
among O
the O
mothers O

daughters O

     | O
intimate O
acquaintance O
to O
represent O

piqued O

affronted O

actually O
ill O

natured O
enough O
to O

that O
Lord O
Doncaster O
was O
still O
almost O
young O

     | O
and O
almost O
handsome O
! O
They O
had O
even O
been O
so O
malicious O
as O

insinuate O
, O
that O
his O
Lordship B-EVENT
might O

     | O
possibly O
have O
a O
genius O
for O
marrying O

the O
only O
respectable O

crossed O
his O

shewed O
how O
completely O

up O

her O

him O
in O

every B-TIME

so O
increasingly O
difficult O

was O
attended O
with O
failures O

disappointments O
so O
unforeseen O

unaccountable O

that O

ominously O

" O
And O
certainly O
he O

of O

no O

in O
the O
estimation O

the O
respect O

he O
withheld O
from O
all O

was O
concentrated O
to O
an O

immeasurable O
degree O

Abbe B-PERSON

a O
gloomy O

     | O
and O
almost O
ferocious O

yet O
never O
was O
there O
a O
greater O
triumph O
of O
art O
over O
nature O
, O
than O
in O
|
     | O
the O
skill O
with O
which O
he O
adapted O
his O
looks O

to O
the O

his O

Though O
in O
personal O

such O

the O
magic O

manner O

it O

generally O
conjectured O

     | O
sudden O

entire O

Laura B-PERSON
Mordaunt I-PERSON

resided O
much O
at O
Kilmarnock B-ORG
Abbe I-ORG
with O
her O
uncle O
, O
to O
whom O
she O

     | O
seemed O
warmly O
and O
blindly O
attached O
, O
but O
the O
gossiping O
world O
sometimes O
conjectured O
that O
perhaps O
|
     | O
the O
evident O
partiality O
and O
admiration O
of O
Lord B-ORG
Doncaster I-ORG
might O
have O
roused O
in O
her O
some O
ambitious O

     | O
thoughts O
, O
backed O
by O
the O
influence O
of O
the O
Abbe B-PERSON

Among O
the O
peculiarities O
of O
the O
Marquis B-PERSON
he O
had O
|
     | O
always O
professed O
a O
decided O
contempt O
for O
all O
respectable O
ladies O
, O
and O
therefore O
his O
attentions O
to O
|
     | O
Laura B-PERSON
Mordaunt I-PERSON
were O
at O
best O
a O
very O
questionable O
compliment O
, O
and O
became O
naturally O
of O
a O
nature O
|
     | O
which O
few O
relatives O
would O
have O
wished O
to O
encourage O
, O
yet O
Miss B-PERSON
Mordaunt I-PERSON
still O
remained O
a O
guest O
at O

     | O
Kilmarnock B-PERSON
Abbey I-PERSON
, O
till O
the O
period O
of O
her O
sudden O
disappearance O
, O
which O
caused O
so O
much O
|
     | O
astonishment O
among O
her O
intimate O
friends O
and O
near O
connections O
, O
that O

Granville I-PERSON
, O
her O

shortly O
before O

wrote O
an O
affectionate O
letter O

the O

, O

     | O
should O
it O
suit O
her O

do O
so O
  O

to O
this O
kind O

generous O
offer O
no O

came O

knew O
his O

it O

     | O
might O

doubted O
whether O
the O

ever O
reached O
that O
hand O

That O
Lord O

had O
already O
disappointed O

     | O
many O

good O

any O

attachment O

that O
she O

     | O
could O
boast O
of O
few O
friends O

no O

might O
really O
have O
been O
dazzled O
with O
the O
splendour O

     | O
of O
his O
rank O

the O
fascination O
of O

it O
seemed O
the O
most O
unaccountable O
part O

     | O
of O
the O
whole O

that O
if O
such O

It O
was O
generally O

the O

sat O
upon O
Lord O

case O

society O

his O
breakfast O
consisted O

strong O
gravy O

poached O
eggs O

were O
pronounced O
to O
be O
very O

     | O
plethoric,—he O
ate O
no O
luncheon O
, O
which O
must O
be O
very O
exhausting O
at O
his O
time O
of O
life,—he B-GPE

an O

     | O
enormous O
appetite O
for O
dinner O
, O
which O
would O
certainly O
drive O
blood O
to O
his O
head,—and O
above O
all O
, O
he O

took O
a O
hot O
supper O

must O
be O
fatal O
at O
last —every O

hearty O
supper O

night O

it O

unaccountable O
how O

Lord O

survived O
! O

     | O
Any O
day O
in O
the O
world O
might O
bring O
accounts O

his O
death,—some O
day O
must O
do O
so O
, O
sooner O

     | O
later,—hundreds O

what O

the O

so O
many O

his O
dutiful O

it O

Still O
Lord O

an O
air O

distinction O

     | O
conscious O
dignity O

commanded O
instant O

There O
was O
an O
energy O
in O
the O
expression O
of O
his O

     | O
feelings O

a O
straightforward O
pursuit O
of O
what O
he O
thought O
right O
in O
all O

no O

     | O
His O
early O

vigorous O
exertion O

no O

Christian B-NORP

With O
all O
the O

frankness O
of O
his O
sailor O

manner O
, O
Sir O

could O
nevertheless O
testify O

     | O
an O
almost O
feminine O
gentleness O
and O
sympathy O
towards O
the O
unfortunate O

He O

often O

clandestinely O

zeal O
in O
serving O
the O
needy O

desolate O

     | O
which O
to O
a O
mind O
less O
eager O

generous O
, O
would O
have O
seemed O
almost O
incredible,—he O
never O

     | O
lacerated O
the O
feelings O
of O
those O
who O
came O
to O
him O
for O
comfort O
, O
by O
attempting O
to O
convince O
the O

     | O
sufferer O

as O
most O
people O
begin O
by O
doing O

the O
misfortune O

whatever O
it O

all O
his O

he O
was O
quite O

better O
pleased O

to O
rejoice O

Sir O

dismissed O
the O

finally O

all O

after O
a O
short O

     | O
soliloquy O

in O
which O
he O
ended O
, O
by O
slyly O
hoping O
that O
the O
gay O
Cornet B-ORG

never O

Not O
many O
days O
following O

the O
Admiral B-ORG

retired O
at O
his O
usual O
early B-TIME
hour I-TIME
to O
bed O

and O
after O

     | O
some O
time O
passed O
in O
profound O
repose O

he O
was O
suddenly O
startled O
into O
wakefulness O
at O
the O
dawn O
of O

     | O
day O
, O
while O
the O

calling O

" O
by O

knocking O
at O
the O
front O

door O

his O
house O

accompanied O
by O
the O
most O
fearful O
and O
vociferous O
|
     | O
out O
- O
cries O
of O
" O
murder O

" O
It O
was O
the O
sharp O
, O
shrill O
tone O
of O
a O
woman O
in O
the O
agony O
of O
fear O

becoming O

     | O
more O

more O
vehement O
at O
every O
repetition O
of O
the O
cry O

while O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
dressed O
with O
the O

     | O
rapidity O
of O
a O
practised O
seaman O

hurried O
down O
stairs O

found O
his O

all O

round O

terrified O

looking O
servant O

gleaming O
with O
an O
expression O

frantic O
alarm O

     | O
while O
, O
from O
her O
incoherent O
exclamations O
, O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
could O
only O
gather O
that O
some O
act O
of O
|
     | O
unutterable O
horror O
had O
been O
perpetrated O
in O
an O
opposite O
house O

the O
windows O

which O
were O
all O

     | O
partially O
closed O

except O
one B-CARDINAL
in O
the O
upper O

which O
was O
wide O
open O

seemed O
to O
be O
much O

     | O
broken O

shattered O
. O
| 
  | O
Without O
waiting O
another O
moment O
to O
investigate O
the O
business O
, O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
strode O
across O
the O
|
     | O
street O
, O
hurried O
in O
at O
the O
open O
door O
, O
and O
guided O
by O
a O
momentary O
cry O
of O
childish O
distress O
, O
he O
|
     | O
mounted O
the O
staircase O
, O
with O
an O
activity O
beyond O
his B-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
three B-CARDINAL
steps O
at O
a O
time O
, O
and O
|
     | O
precipitately O
entered O
the O
nearest O
room O
he O
could O
find O
. O
There O
he O
paused O
for O
a O
moment O
on O
finding O
|
     | O
himself O
in O
a O
splendidly O

furnished O
bed O

room O

adorned O
with O
a O
degree O
of O
taste O

elegance O
, O
far O

     | O
excelling O
what O
was O
customary O
in O
so O
obscure O
- O
looking O
a O
lodging O
, O
and O
the O
Admiral B-ORG
was O
about O
hastily O
|
     | O
to O
withdraw O
, O
when O
he O
became O
suddenly O
transfixed O
to O
the O
spot O
, O
and O
his O
eye O
seemed O
perfectly O
|
     | O
blasted O
by O
the O
spectacle O
which O
met O
his O
agitated O
and O
astonished O
gaze O
, O
while O
several O
moments O
|
     | O
elapsed O
before O
he O
had O
nerve O
to O
advance O
, O

ascertain O
the O
reality O
of O
a O
scene O

him O

The O

Her O

her O

a O

turned O
towards O
the O

     | O
ruddy O
healthful O
countenance O
of O
her O
child O
in O
his O
peaceful O
slumbers O
, O
and O
it O
was O
evident O
that O
her O

     | O
last O
thought O
had O
been O
for O
him O
, O
as O
his O
clothes O
were O
still O
convulsively O
held O
in O
her O
left O
hand O
, O

     | O
while O
a O
vain O
attempt O
had O
obviously O
been O
made O
to O
tear O
them O
asunder,—many O
deep O
cuts O
being O
visible O

     | O
on O
the O
child O
's O
night O

gown O
, O
though O
his O
person O
had O
been O
left O
uninjured O

  | O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
compassionately O
snatched O
the O
boy O
up O
in O
his O
arms O
, O
to O
hurry O
him O
away O
from O
the O

     | O
dreadful O
scene O
, O
and O
called O
the O
watchman O
, O
who O
instantly O
raised O
an O
alarm O
, O
and O
summoned O
the O
whole O

     | O
neighborhood O
to O
his O
assistance O
, O
when O
before O
ten B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
had O
elapsed O
, O
the O
room O
was O
filled O
with O
a O

     | O
crowd O
of O
agitated O
spectators O
, O
scared O
by O
the O
tremendous O
event O
, O
and O
crowding O
around O
the O
bed O
in O

     | O
every O
attitude O
of O
astonishment O
, O
terror O
, O
and O
commiseration O
, O
uttering O
exclamations O
of O
alarm O
, O

     | O
gazing O
helplessly O
at O
the O
frightful O
spectacle O
, O
and O
forming O
a O
thousand B-CARDINAL
conjectures O
respecting O
the O

     | O
tragical O
event O
, O
instead O
of O
attempting O
to O
give O
any O
rational O
assistance O

  | O
" O
Not O
a O
moment O

" O
said O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
, O
in O
the O
steady O
authoritive O
tone O
of O
one B-CARDINAL

     | O
accustomed O

command O
, O
" O
Where O

" O
asked O
he O
, O
turning O

     | O
to O
the O
girl O
who O
had O
first B-ORDINAL
given O
an O
alarm O

where O

" O
I O

no O

Sir O

replied O
she O
in O
a O
low O
incoherent O
whisper O
. O
" O
I O
think O
the O
lady O
was O
not O

Sir O

earnestly O

" O
A O
sort O
of O

Sir O

I O
do O

know O
nothing O

him O

he O
visited O

     | O
sometimes O
at O
this O

No O

for O
my O

much O
loud O
talking O

     | O
argufying O
in O
the O

it O

none O

Sir O

, O
in O
a O
deep O
and O
solemn O
tone O
, O
while O

     | O
he O
glanced O
at O

many O
strangers O

Sir O

followed O
by O
the O
whole O
troop O
of O

huddled O
together O

     | O
with O
evident O
symptoms O
of O
fearful O
apprehension O

proceeded O
minutely O

whole O

out O
of O
charity O

to O
teach O
the O
little O

the O
bed O
was O

     | O
disordered O

as O

hastily O
rising O

had O
thrown O
the O

almost O
upon O
the O

     | O
floor O

The O
window O

frame O
was O
broken O
to O
shivers O
, O
by O
some O
one O
violently O
forcing O
his O
way O
out O
  O

     | O
no O

in O
the O
drawers O

not O

the O
search O
was O
about O

when O
Sir O

     | O
Arthur B-PERSON
perceived O
in O
an O
obscure O
corner O
of O
the O

a O
man O

a O
red O

     | O
silk O
handkerchief O
, O
from O
which O
the O
initials O
had O
evidently O
been O
erased O
with O
great O
care O
, O
though O
he O

     | O
hoped O
that O
some B-CARDINAL

The O
next O

Sir O

attempted O
to O

had O
the O
door O
double O

locked O
  O

though O
the O

     | O
party O

accompanied O
him O
made O
a O
noise O
of O
knocking O

impetuously O

the O

When O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
, O
disregarding O
the O
simple O
girl O
's O
warning O
, O
advanced O
, O
he O
perceived O
with O
surprise O

     | O
a O
very O
young O
woman O
, O
scarcely O
twenty B-CARDINAL

who O
started O
up O
in O
bed O
, O
with O
a O
look O
of O
bewildered O

     | O
perplexity O
, O
as O
he O
approached O
, O
asking O
in O
accents O
of O
tremulous O
alarm O
, O
what O
had O
occurred O
to O
cause O
|
     | O
this O
extraordinary O
disturbance O
. O
Her O
cheek O
was O
of O
an O
ashy O
paleness O
, O
her O
very O
lips O
were O
blanched O
, O
|
     | O
and O
her O
voice O
sounded O
husky O
and O
hollow O
with O
agitation O
  O
but O
all O
this O
might O
be O
attributed O
to O
so O
|
     | O
sudden O
an O
inroad O
of O
strangers O
, O
while O
again O
and O
again O
she O
asked O
with O
quivering O
accents O
, O
whether O

     | O
any O
accident O
had O
occurred O

" O

all O

my O

added O
she O
, O
holding O
out O
her O
arms O
to O
the O
child O
, O
who O

     | O
instantly O
recoiled O
from O
her O

with O

terror O

his O
face O
on O
the O

     | O
shoulder O
of O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
, O
he O
sobbed O
aloud O
with O
a O
degree O
of O
passionate O
grief O
and O
agitation O
which O
|
     | O
seemed O
almost O
beyond O
his B-DATE
years I-DATE
. O
The O
observant O
eye O
of O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
perceived O
that O
a O
dark O
scowl O
of O
|
     | O
malignity O
flitted O
for O
a O
moment O
across O
the O
beautiful O
features O
of O
Sarah B-PERSON
, O
whose O
brow O
became O

     | O
singularly O
contracted O
over O
her O
flashing O
eyes O

making O
an O
effort O
instantly O
to O
recover O

     | O
herself O
, O
she O
averted O
her O
countenance O

added O

a O
subdued O
voice O

tranquillity O

" O

the O

many O

confused O
me O

In O
an O
instant O
she O
snatched O
off O
her O
night O

cap O

when O
her O
shoulders O

neck O
became O
covered O
with O

     | O
a O
cloud O
of O
dark O
massy O
ringlets O

floating O
down O
below O
her O
waist O

shading O
her O
pallid O

     | O
countenance O

had O
assumed O
an O
expression O

" O

him O

come O

me O

she O
again O
, O
stretching O
out O
her O
arms O
with O
a O
ghastly O
smile O
  O
but O
the O
boy O

     | O
struggled O
more O
vehemently O
than O
before O
, O
and O
clung O
to O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
with O
a O
tenacity O
and O
confidence O
, O
|
     | O
which O
deeply O
touched O
the O
old O
veteran O

heart O

who O
tried O
to O
soothe O
the O
terrified O
child O
by O
every O

     | O
endearment O
which O
his O
kind O
nature O
could O
suggest O
, O
while O
his O
attention O
was O
nevertheless O
enchained O

     | O
by O
observing O
the O
rigid O
, O
marble O
look O
of O
the O
young O
woman O
's O
countenance O
  O
the O
dragged O
and O
|
     | O
corpse O
- O
like O
appearance O
which O
stole O
over O
her O
features O
, O
as O
if O
she O
had O
suffered O
a O
stroke O
of O

" O

enough O
already O

Sir O

The O

seemed O
to O
understand O
Sir O

promise O
of O
protection O
, O
and O
his O
head O
drooped O

sleepily O
down O
, O
while O
his O
eyes O
again O
closed O
in O
that O
deep O
unnatural O

" O
Young O
woman O
! O
" O
said O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
, O
bending O
a O
look O
of O
penetrating O
scrutiny O
on O
Sarah B-PERSON
Davenport I-PERSON
, O
|
     | O
" O
how O
came O
you O
to O
be O
quietly O
asleep O
, O
and O
partly O
dressed O
too O
! O
while O
your O
mistress O
was O
murdered O
in O
|
     | O
the O
room O
immediately O
below O
! O
Did O
you O
hear O
no O
disturbance O
? O
Was O
no O
alarm O
given O
? O
" O

  | O
" O
My O
mistress O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
Sarah B-PERSON
, O
clasping O
her O
hands O
in O
an O
attitude O
of O
astonishment O
, O
and O
|
     | O
speaking O
as O
if O
every O
word O
would O
choke O
her O
, O
though O
not O
a O
muscle O
of O
her O
face O
was O
altered O
from O
the O
|
     | O
fixed O
and O
rigid O
look O
it O
had O
previously O
worn O
. O
" O
Oh O
! O
what O
will O
become O
of O
me O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
What O
will O
become O
of O
you O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
sternly O
, O
fixing O
his O
penetrating O
eye O
upon O
her O
. O
|
     | O
" O
Think O
rather O
of O
your O
murdered O
mistress O
! O
Come O
, O
come O
, O
girl O
! O
you O
performed O
that O
start O
very O
well O
  O
|
     | O
but O
I O
know O
good O
acting O
! O
I O
greatly O
fear O
you O
are O
more O
concerned O
in O
this O
horrid O
business O
than O
we O
|
     | O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
suspected O
, O
and O
much O
more O
than O
you O
would O
wish O
to O
acknowledge O
. O
Get O
up O
instantly O
, O
and O
|
     | O
follow O
me O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
There O
was O
something O
fearful O
and O
appalling O
in O
the O
silence O
which O
reigned O
among O
the O
many O
persons O
|
     | O
who O
had O
gathered O
around O
, O
when O
Sarah B-PERSON
, O
as O
a O
prisoner O
, O
was O
led O
into O
the O
chamber O
of O
death O
. O
A O
look O
|
     | O
of O
shuddering O
horror O
distorted O
for O
a O
moment O
her O
pale O
and O
haggard O
countenance O
, O
when O
she O
was O
|
     | O
unwillingly O
drawn O
forward O
to O
the O
place O
where O
her O
deceased O
mistress O
lay O
, O
and O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
, O
with O
|
     | O
silent O
solemnity O
, O
pointed O
to O
the O
ghastly O
spectacle O
. O
His O
eyes O
were O
intensely O
and O
most O
mournfully O
|
     | O
fixed O
on O
the O
prisoner O
's O
sullen O
and O
nearly O
livid O
countenance O
, O
while O
she O
silently O
clung O
to O
a O
|
     | O
chair O
to O
support O
herself O
. O
| 
  | O
Sarah B-PERSON
appeared O
neither O
startled O
nor O
astonished O
after O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
thrill O
of O
horror O
, O
but O
with O
a O
|
     | O
cold O
stony O
look O
of O
almost O
preternatural O
calmness O
, O
she O
muttered O
to O
herself O
in O
a O
low O
tone O
, O
which O
|
     | O
became O
nevertheless O
distinctly O
audible O
to O
all O
the O
spectators O
, O
and O
was O
evidently O
meant O
to O
be O
|
     | O
heard O
, O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
Why O
am O
I O
brought O
here O
! O
I O
know O
nothing O
, O
about O
this O
! O
The O
poor O
lady O
has O
committed O
suicide O
! O
No O
|
     | O
wonder O
! O
She O
often O
wished O
herself O
dead O
! O
She O
had O
a O
miserable O
life O
of O
it O
, O
and O
has O
got O
rest O
at O
|
     | O
last O
! O
I O
wish O
! O
" O
added O
Sarah B-PERSON
suddenly O
, O
with O
vehement O
, O
almost O
frantic O
energy O
, O
" O
O O
how O
I O
wish O
that O
I O
|
     | O
could O
change O
places O
with O
her O
! O
O O
that O
I O
could O
be O
that O
cold O
, O
senseless O
image O
, O
without O
memory O
or O

     | O
feeling O
, O
without O
hope O
or O
fear O
, O
shut O
up O
from O
living O
wretchedness O
in O
everlasting O
sleep O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Let O
us O
hope O
that O
the O
Almighty O
has O
in O
mercy O
received O
her O
never O
- O
dying O
soul O
, O
and O
that O
in O
His O
|
     | O
own O
good O
time O
He O
will O
reveal O
the O
guilty O
assassins O
who O
sent O
her O
so O
suddenly O
to O
judgment O
, O
" O
said O
|
     | O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
solemnly O
. O
" O
Unburden B-GPE
your O
own O
mind O
now O
, O
by O
confessing O
all O
, O
and O
be O
assured O
it O
will O
|
     | O
relieve O
the O
agony O
you O
are O
so O
evidently O
suffering O
. O
Murder O
is O
like O
fire O
, O
it O
can O
not O
be O
smothered O
|
     | O
long O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
know O
nothing O
! O
What O
could O
I O
know O
! O
" O
replied O
Sarah B-PERSON
hurriedly O
. O
" O
She O
has O
destroyed O
herself O
, O
or O
|
     | O
thieves O
have O
broken O
into O
the O
house O
and O
robbed O
her O
. O
Could O
I O
help O
that O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
No O
one O
has O
broken O
into O
this O
house O
, O
" O
replied O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
, O
scanning O
the O
expression O
of O
her O
fixed O
|
     | O
and O
apparently O
unalterable O
features O
. O
" O
But O
you O
can O
perhaps O
tell O
us O
who O
escaped O
by O
that O
shattered O
|
     | O
window O
above O
? O
Not O
a O
lock O
is O
broken O
— O
not O
a O
door O
is O
injured O
— O
not O
a O
trinket O
seems O
missing O
, O
among O
the O
|
     | O
many O
scattered O
around O
the O
room O
. O
Here O
is O
money O
in O
abundance O
, O
if O
gold O
had O
been O
the O
inducement O
! O
|
     | O
Some O
other O
motive O
has O
provoked O
this O
crime O
— O
jealousy O
perhaps O
— O
or O
revenge O
— O
— O
" O
| 
  | O
At O
the O
last O
word O
an O
angry O
hectic O
rushed O
over O
the O
face O
, O
arms O
, O
and O
neck O
of O
the O
prisoner O
, O
and O
|
     | O
her O
eye O
glittered O
for O
a O
moment O
with O
an O
unnatural O
fire O
, O
which O
rapidly O
faded O
away O
, O
leaving O
her O
as O
|
     | O
pale O
and O
death O
- O
like O
as O
the O
corpse O
beside O
which O
she O
stood O
, O
and O
on O
which O
her O
eye O
now O
rested O
with O
|
     | O
a O
look O
of O
cold O
and O
passionless O
indifference O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
It O
was O
only B-DATE
yesterday I-DATE
that O
she O
wished O
herself O
dead O
! O
this O
is O
her O
own O
doing O

" O
said O
Sarah B-PERSON
, O

     | O
turning O
away O
. O
" O
Why O
am O
I O
brought O
here O
! O
This O
is O
too O
dreadful O
! O
too O
shocking O
! O
It O
will O
drive O
me O
|
     | O
mad O
— O
it O
will O
! O
it O
will O
! O
" O
added O
she O
, O
with O
rising O
agitation O
  O
and O
then O
suddenly O
bursting O
in O
a O
|
     | O
hideous O
maniacal O
laugh O
, O
which O
rang O
with O
fearful O
sound O
through O
the O
gloomy O
chamber O
, O
and O
caused O
|
     | O
the O
horror O
- O
struck O
spectators O
to O
fall O
hastily O
back O
, O
" O
I O
would O
have O
saved O
her O
! O
I O
would O
! O
What O
woman O
|
     | O
ever O
sheds O
blood O
! O
but O
it O
was O
too O
late O
! O
I O
would O
have O
saved O
her O
, O
as O
I O
saved O
the O
child O
  O
but O
it O
was O
|
     | O
done O
— O
kill O
me O
! O
kill O
me O
! O
if O
you O
have O
any O
mercy O
, O
let O
me O
die O
! O
let O
me O
hide O
myself O
in O
the O
grave O
for O
|
     | O
ever O
! O
" O
Saying O
these O
words O
, O
with O
a O
scream O
of O
agony O
, O
she O
fell O
upon O
the O
floor O
in O
violent O
|
     | O
convulsions O
, O
from O
which O
it O
was O
nearly B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour I-TIME
before O
she O
entirely O
recovered O
, O
when O
faint O
, O
weak O
, O
|
     | O
and O
exhausted O
, O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
suggested O
that O
she O
could O
be O
carried O
to O
bed O
  O
but O
before O
she O
left O
the O

     | O
room O
, O
anxious O
, O
if O
possible O
, O
to O
elucidate O
the O
mystery O
, O
and O
to O
gain O
some O
clue O
for O
pursuing O
the O

     | O
actual O
murderer O
, O
he O
detained O
Sarah B-PERSON
during O
a O
moment O
, O
and O
desired O
that O
a O
glass O
of O
water O
might O
be O
|
     | O
brought O
for O
her O
, O
hoping O
that O
the O
violent O
emotion O
she O
had O
betrayed O
might O
lead O
her O
to O
a O
full O

     | O
confession O

Laying O
his O
hand O
then O
upon O
her O
arm O

in O
tones O
of O
deep O
and O
awful O
solemnity O
, O
he O
looked O

     | O
at O
her O

pointed O
once O
more O
to O
the O
corpse O

saying O
, O
— O

" O

himself O

some O

the O

handsome O

desiring O
him O

hurried O
up O

     | O
remained O
in O
the O
room O
alone O
for O
several B-TIME

Both O
were O
much O
muffled O
up O

evidently O

     | O
avoided O
any O
scrutiny O

they O

as O
they O
hastened O
past O

themselves O
into O

hackney O

them O
at O
some O
distance O

one B-CARDINAL

overcome O

that O

could O
not O
walk O

     | O
without O

Much O
conjecture O
was O
aroused O
by O
this O
incident O

seemed O
to O
increase O
the O

     | O
mystery O

interest O
attached O

the O
melancholy O

not O

     | O
of O

unexpectedly O

tragically O
thrown O

found O

the O
night O

felt O
himself O
awed O

deeply O
affected O
in O
contemplating O

solemn O
preparations O

apparently O
unlamented O

It O
was O
with O
mournful O

mysterious O
wonder O
that O
he O
stood O
beside O
the O

     | O
corpse O

contemplated O
that O
mortal O
frame O

from O

the O
spirit O
had O
been O
so O
suddenly O

so O

     | O
cruelly O
driven O

could O
not O

imagine O
the O
scenes O

love O

joy O

those O
eyes O
had O

     | O
once O
probably O
looked O
upon O

the O
busy O
thoughts O

CHAPTER O
V. O
| 
  | O
The O
day O
of O
trial O
at O
length O
arrived O
, O
and O
the O
court O
, O
from O
the O
roof O
to O
the O
floor O
, O
seemed O
one B-CARDINAL
sea O
|
     | O
of O
faces O
, O
crowded O
together O
like O
the O
" O
studies O
of O
heads O
" O
on O
a O
painter O
's O
canvass O
. O
During O
the O
legal O
|
     | O
investigation O
, O
which O
was O
conducted O
with O
deep O
solemnity O
and O
anxious O
perseverance O
, O
the O
mystery O
|
     | O
became O
still O
deeper O
, O
and O
more O
inscrutable O
. O
No O
appearance O
of O
a O
robbery O
could O
be O
observed O
, O
except O
|
     | O
that O
the O
finger O
of O
the O
lady O
's O
hand O
, O
on O
which O
a O
wedding O
ring O
had O
probably O
been O
worn O
, O
was O
much O
|
     | O
bruised O
and O
discolored O
, O
as O
if O
, O
immediately O
after O
her O
decease O
, O
it O
had O
been O
violently O
torn O
off O
  O
|
     | O
and O
a O
vain O
attempt O
had O
evidently O
been O
made O
to O
snatch O
away O
a O
gold O
chain O
hung O
round O
her O
neck O
, O
to O
|
     | O
which O
was O
appended O
a O
small O
broken O
miniature O
frame O
, O
set O
with O
brilliants O
, O
and O
adorned O
with O
what O
|
     | O
seemed O
to O
represent O
a O
very O
antique O
coronet O
. O
The O
portrait O
which O
it O
once O
enclosed O
, O
had O
been O
, O
with O
|
     | O
obvious O
difficulty O
removed O
, O
as O
the O
marks O
were O
visible O
all O
round O
, O
of O
some O
sharp O
- O
pointed O
|
     | O
instrument O
having O
been O
inserted O
in O
the O
frame O
, O
to O
which O
there O
still O
adhered O
several O
broken O

     | O
fragments O
of O
glass O

Sarah B-PERSON
Davenport I-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
been O
fully O
committed O
for O
trial O
, O
on O
suspicion O
of O
being O
an O
accomplice O
, O
|
     | O
refused O
to O
give O
any O
references O
as O
to O
character O
, O
and O
was O
strongly O
suspected O
of O
habitually O
|
     | O
concealing O
her O
real O
name O
, O
and O
of O
more O
than O
once O
assuming O
those O
that O
were O
fictitious O
, O
as O
her O
|
     | O
clothes O
and O
linen O
appeared O
to O
be O
marked O
with O
various O
initials O
, O
but O
in O
not O
one B-CARDINAL
case O
did O
they O
|
     | O
bear O
those O
that O
she O
pretended O
were O
her O
own O
. O
It O
was O
evident O
that O
she O
labored O
under O
a O
powerful O
, O
|
     | O
but O
forcibly O
- O
subdued O
excitement O
  O
yet O
, O
with O
a O
tone O
and O
manner O
externally O
cold O
and O
hard O
as O
|
     | O
Siberian B-NORP
ice O
, O
she O
persisted O
in O
professing O
her O
own O
perfect O
innocence O
, O
and O
her O
utter O
|
     | O
consciousness O
of O
anything O
that O
might O
by O
possibility O
lead O
to O
a O
discovery O
of O
the O
perpetrators O
. O
|
     | O
She O
coldly O
, O
and O
almost O
calmly O
, O
threw O
back O
glance O
for O
glance O
, O
on O
the O
spectators O
nearest O
her O
, O
who O
|
     | O
were O
keenly O
watching O
every O
turn O
of O
her O
countenance O
, O
while O
dark O
surmises O
, O
and O
fearful O
|
     | O
conjectures O
, O
were O
whispered O
in O
murmurs O
of O
horror O
on O
every O
side O
  O
but O
at O
length O
her O
eye O
wandered O
|
     | O
to O
a O
distant O
part O
of O
the O
court O
, O
when O
suddenly O
a O
livid O
paleness O
flashed O
upon O
her O
face O
— O
an O
|
     | O
indescribable O
but O
startling O
lustre O
glittered O
in O
her O
eyes O
— O
her O
whole O
frame O
shook O
, O
as O
in O
the O
|
     | O
coldest O
blast O
of O
winter B-DATE
, O
and O
with O
a O
suppressed O
groan O
of O
agony O
and O
fear O
, O
she O
bowed O
her O
head O
upon O
|
     | O
her O
hands O
, O
and O
sunk O
fainting O
upon O
the O
floor O
. O
At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
a O
man O
was O
observed O
hastily O
to O
|
     | O
leave O
the O
court O
, O
and O
, O
gliding O
with O
rapid O
steps O
through O
the O
narrow O
passages O
, O
disappeared O
, O
before O
|
     | O
any O
of O
those O
who O
stood O
near O
had O
presence O
of O
mind O
to O
stop O
him O
, O
or O
could O
even O
identify O
his O
|
     | O
appearance O
. O
| 
  | O
Nothing O
apparently O
touched O
the O
feelings O
of O
Sarah B-PERSON
Davenport I-PERSON
, O
except O
when O
a O
suspicion O
seemed O
to O
|
     | O
be O
implied O
that O
she O
meant O
to O
injure O
the O
boy O
  O
and O
when O
a O
question O
to O
this O
effect O
was O
put O
to O
her O
|
     | O
by O
the O
court O
, O
she O
wrung O
her O
hands O
and O
burst O
into O
tears O
, O
saying O
, O
in O
accents O
of O
piercing O
anguish O
, O
|
     | O
though O
with O
a O
shudder O
as O
if O
death O
were O
upon O
her O
, O
" O
No O
! O
oh O
, O
no O
! O
Who O
suspects O
that O
I O
would O
injure O

     | O
a O
hair O

his O
head O

He O
once O
loved O
me O

Few O
— O
few O
but O
he O
, O
ever O
did!—none O
that O
have O
not O
afterwards O
|
     | O
given O
me O
reason O
to O
hate O
them O
! O
I O
am O
a O
solitary O
, O
lost O
, O
and O
desolate O
being O
  O
but O
let O
him O
not O
forget O
|
     | O
in O
after O
years B-DATE
, O
that O
I O
saved O
his O
life!—that O
I O
saved O
it O
at O
a O
risk O
you O
never O
can O
conceive O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
An O
impulse O
of O
mournful O
interest O
and O
astonishment O
ran O
through O
the O
assembled O
multitude O
, O
when O
|
     | O
they O
beheld O
the O
rare O
and O
singular O
beauty O
of O
the O
child O
, O
after O
he O
was O
led O
into O
court O
  O
and O
it O
|
     | O
seemed O
as O
if O
the O
spectators O
had O
ceased O
to O
breathe O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
began O
to O
answer O
some O
of O
the O
|
     | O
questions O
which O
were O
skilfully O
put O
, O
to O
draw O
out O
his O
recollections O
of O
past O
times O
, O
and O
especially O
|
     | O
the O
dark O
history O
of O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
few I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
. O
He O
was O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
shy O
and O
intimidated O
, O
but O
gradually O
|
     | O
regained O
an O
unexpected O
degree O
of O
self O
- O
possession O
, O
and O
spoke O
with O
a O
surprising O
degree O
of O
|
     | O
intelligence O
and O
distinctness O
of O
all O
he O
remembered O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
boy O
retained O
a O
faint O
recollection O
of O
having O
been O
awakened O
, O
on O
the B-TIME
night I-TIME
of O
the O
murder O
, O
by O
|
     | O
some O
violent O
scene O
of O
strife O
and O
horror O
  O
but O
his O
faculties O
had O
evidently O
been O
so O
benumbed O
by O
|
     | O
opiates O
, O
that O
no O
distinct O
impression O
remained O
  O
and O
to O
his O
own O
young O
mind O
, O
the O
whole O
seemed O
like O

     | O
a O
fearful O

too O
dreadful O

look O
back O

even O
yet O
, O

with O
bewildering O
terror O

gave O
a O
clear O
account O

however O

of O
the B-TIME
last I-TIME

he O
had O
passed O
with O
his O

he O

spoke O
in O
accents O

infantine O
affection O

evidently O
unable O

to O
conceive O
that O

said O

come O
into O
the O

spoken O
angrily O
to O
her O
  O
while O
, O
with O

     | O
astonishing O
precision O
, O
the O
boy O
acted O
over O
the O
whole O
scene O

recapitulated O
some O
of O
the O
language O

used O

described O
how O

hung O

him O
with O
frantic O
eagerness O

saying O
she O

would O
promise O

was O
very O

tall O

wore O
a O
black O
coat O

had O
spoken O
again O
with O
angry O
vehemence O
before O
he O
left O

     | O
how O
his O
mother O
, O
when O
left O
alone O

had O
prayed O

wept O
over O
him O

looks O

desolate O
grief O

away O

by O
the O
maid O

who O
administered O
some O

him O

which O
she O
said O
the O
doctor O

ordered O

He O
spoke O
much O
also O
of O
a O
large O
room O

hung O
with O

in O

Sarah B-PERSON

rigidly O

respecting O

who O

pertinaciously O
maintained O

During O
a O
long O

anxious O
consultation O
of O
the O

there O
was O
a O
hushed O

intense O
silence O
in O

     | O
the O
court O
, O
so O
still O

unbroken O

that O
the O

an O

would O
have O
been O
audible O
, O

     | O
while O
every O
eye O
perused O
the O
countenance O
of O
the O
prisoner O
, O
with O
an O
intensity O
that O
brought O
a O

     | O
hectic O
flush O
, O
burning O
like O
fire O
, O
upon O
her O
cheek O
, O
and O
she O
gazed O
around O
with O
a O
glance O
of O
anger O

     | O
that O
caused O
her O
beauty O
for O
the O
moment O

look O

certain O

no O

Nothing O

the O

Sir O

often O

     | O

Arthur B-PERSON
had O
read O
the O
same O
thing O
in O
different O
words O
every O
|
     | O
day O
during O
fifty B-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
and O
under O
twenty B-CARDINAL
varied O
administrations O
  O
yet O
still O
the O
wonder O
grew O
, O
how O
|
     | O
a O
constitution O
so O
mismanaged O
could O
so O
long O
survive O
, O
and O
that O
when O
all O
was O
wrong O
at O
the O
head O
of O
|
     | O
the O
country O
, O
it O
still O
had O
a O
leg O
to O
stand O
on O
. O
The O
Admiral B-ORG
's O
patriotic O
meditations O
had O
been O
|
     | O
several O
times O
interrupted O
by O
repeated O
complaints O
from O
the O
little O
girls O
, O
that O
Henry B-GPE
had O
hid O
|
     | O
himself O
so O
well O
, O
that O
they O
could O
not O
possibly O
find O
him O
  O
but O
he O
was O
too O
much O
pre O
- O
occupied O
to O
|
     | O
give O
the O
subject O
much O
attention O
, O
till O
at O
length O
Martin B-PERSON
announced O
that O
the O
children O
's O
dinner O
had O
|
     | O
waited O
some O
time O
, O
and O
that O
still O
the O
boy O
was O
not O
to O
be O
found O
, O
though O
his O
companions O
had O
been O
|
     | O
searching O
for O
him O
at B-CARDINAL
least I-CARDINAL
half I-CARDINAL
an O
hour O
. O
| 
  | O
Upon O
hearing O
this O
, O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
hastily O
started O
up O
, O
making O
a O
considerable O
expenditure O
of O
|
     | O
energetic O
and O
wondrous O
explanations O
, O
while O
he O
gazed O
around O
with O
increasing O
surprise O
at O
the O
wide O
|
     | O
waste O
of O
sand O
, O
like O
an O
Arabian B-NORP
desert O
, O
with O
which O
he O
was O
on O
every O
side O
encompassed O
, O
and O
where O
|
     | O
it O
seemed O
to O
him O
as O
if O
a O
mouse O
could O
not O
be O
long O
concealed O
. O
| 
  | O
A O
hasty O
and O
most O
anxious O
search O
was O
instantly O
commenced O
in O
the O
garden O
, O
while O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
and O
|
     | O
Martin B-PERSON
shouted O
the O
name O
of O
Henry B-GPE
at O
the O
full O
pitch O
of O
their O
voices O
, O
but O
in O
vain O
  O
not O
a O
sound O
|
     | O
was O
heard O
in O
reply O
, O
nor O
was O
there O
a O
spot O
unexamined O
in O
which O
he O
could O
by O
possibility O
be O
|
     | O
lurking O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
Admiral B-ORG
now O
became O
seriously O
alarmed O
at O
so O
unaccountable O
a O
disappearance O
, O
especially O
when O
|
     | O
the O
child O
's O
gardening O
tools O
, O
with O
which O
he O
had O
been O
last O
observed O
, O
were O
found O
mutilated O
and O
|
     | O
broken O
, O
at O
a O
great O
distance O
, O
on O
the O
beach O
— O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
his O
shoes O
had O
fallen O
off O
close O
to O
the O
water O
, O
|
     | O
and O
his O
hat O
lay O
nearly O
buried O
in O
the O
tide O
. O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
instantly O
summoned O
the O
police O
to O
his O
aid O
, O
|
     | O
but O
the O
search O
continued O
fruitless O
, O
till O
at O
length O
the O
dreadful O
conjecture O
became O
more O
and O
more O
|
     | O
probable O
, O
that O
Henry B-GPE
must O
have O
rashly O
ventured O
into O
the O
water O
, O
and O
been O
washed O
away O
by O
the O
|
     | O
waves O
— O
in O
pursuance O
of O
which O
apprehension O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
summoned O
more O
assistance O
, O
that O
the O
water O
|
     | O
might O
instantly O
be O
dragged O
. O
| 
  | O
Martin B-PERSON
, O
meantime O
, O
no O
less O
active O
than O
his O
master O
, O
had O
accidentally O
met O
a O
stranger O
on O
the O
|
     | O
beach O
, O
who O
mentioned O
, O
on O
hearing O
of O
his O
alarm O
, O
that O
on O
the O
road O
to O
Leith B-GPE
, O
half B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour I-TIME
before O
, O
|
     | O
he O
had O
observed O
a O
boy O
struggling O
and O
screaming O
in O
the O
arms O
of O
a O
female O
, O
dressed O
like O
a O
|
     | O
nursery O
- O
maid O
, O
who O
complained O
loudly O
that O
the O
child O
would O
not O
go O
home O
, O
when O
a O
young O
man O
, O
rather O
|
     | O
strangely O
dressed O
, O
and O
of O
very O
singular O
appearance O
, O
had O
instantly O
offered O
his O
assistance O
, O
and O
|
     | O
carried O
him O
forcibly O
onwards O
. O
This O
gentleman O
said O
he O
had O
stopped O
the O
woman O
to O
remonstrate O
with O
|
     | O
her O
on O
using O
the O
boy O
so O
roughly O
, O
as O
a O
cap O
was O
drawn O
over O
his O
eyes O
, O
and O
he O
seemed O
to O
suffer O
|
     | O
agonies O
of O
terror O
, O
sobbing O
convulsively O
, O
and O
trembling O
in O
every O
limb O
  O
but O
the O
man O
had O
answered O
|
     | O
in O
reply O
, O
with O
a O
strong O
Irish B-NORP
accent O
, O
that O
he O
would O
see O
the O
child O
safe O
to O
his O
friends O
, O
and O
let O
|
     | O
no O
one O
do O
the O
poor O
boy O
" O
a O
taste O
of O
harm O
. O
" O
The O
stranger O
added O
indifferently O
, O
that O
it O
was O
no O
|
     | O
affair O
of O
his O
, O
therefore O
he O
ceased O
to O
interfere O
  O
but O
he O
thought O
both O
the O
man O
and O
the O
woman O
had O
|
     | O
a O
very O
bad O
expression O
, O
and O
he O
would O
not O
trust O
either O
of O
them O
with O
his O
dog O
for O
an B-TIME
hour I-TIME
, O
to O
use O
|
     | O
it O
kindly O
. O
| 
  | O
Without O
wasting O
time O
in O
returning O
to O
communicate O
what O
he O
had O
heard O
, O
Martin B-PERSON
hurried O
forward O
to O
|
     | O
Leith B-GPE
, O
where O
, O
with O
reckless O
speed O
and O
untiring O
diligence O
, O
he O
threaded O
all O
the O
narrow O
streets O
, O
|
     | O
and O
elbowed O
his O
way O
among O
carts O
, O
carriages O
, O
parcels O
, O
and O
passengers O
, O
till O
at O
length O
he O
reached O
|
     | O
the O
pier O
, O
to O
which O
he O
had O
been O
so O
eagerly O
aiming O
his O
steps O
. O
At O
its O
farthest O
point O
stood O
a O
|
     | O
smoking O
steam O
- O
boat O
in O
full O
boil O
, O
while O
men O
and O
women O
, O
boxes O
, O
packages O
, O
bags O
, O
and O
trunks O
were O
|
     | O
pouring O
in O
  O
and O
at O
length O
, O
as O
he O
breathlessly O
approached O
within O
some B-QUANTITY
hundred I-QUANTITY
yards I-QUANTITY
, O
an O
|
     | O
arbitrary O
little O
bell O
was O
rung O
, O
to O
summon O
stragglers O
on O
board O
, O
and O
to O
hurry O
stragglers O
|
     | O
away O
. O
| 
  | O
A O
single O
plank O
, O
connecting O
the O
steam O
- O
boat O
with O
the O
pier O
, O
was O
on O
the O
point O
of O
being O
withdrawn O
, O
|
     | O
when O
Martin B-ORG
approached O
  O
and O
while O
he O
paused O
, O
in O
momentary O
hesitation O
whether O
to O
pursue O
his O
|
     | O
almost O
hopeless O
search O
, O
the O
steward O
peremptorily O
desired O
him O
to O
hasten O
on O
board O
instantly O
, O
if O
|
     | O
he O
were O
coming O
at O
all O
, O
as O
not O
a O
moment O
more O
could O
be O
lost O
. O
| 
  | O
At O
this O
moment O
a O
cry O
, O
almost O
amounting O
to O
a O
scream O
of O
childish O
joy O
, O
became O
audible O
on O
the O
|
     | O
deck O
— O
a O
young O
boy O
was O
seen O
vehemently O
struggling O
in O
the O
arms O
of O
a O
female O
  O
and O
in O
an O
instant O
, O
|
     | O
pursued O
by O
a O
man O
who O
vainly O
endeavored O
to O
overtake O
him O
, O
he O
rushed O
past O
the O
steward O
, O
ran O
across O
|
     | O
the O
temporary O
bridge O
, O
and O
clasped O
Martin B-ORG
round O
the O
knees O
, O
exclaiming O
, O
with O
eager O
incoherent O
|
     | O
exclamations O
of O
almost O
hysterical O
delight O
, O
" O
Take O
me O
, O
Martin B-PERSON
! O
take O
me O

me O

home O

horrid O
woman O

tied O
a O
cap O
over O
my O

been O
so O
frightened O
and O
so O

     | O
sorry O

added O
the O
child O
, O
bursting O
into O
tears O
, O
and O
sobbing O
as O
if O
his O
heart O
would O
break O
  O
" O
I O

     | O
thought O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
would O
be O
angry O

I O
thought O

perhaps O

never O

  | O
The O
boy O
put O
his O
hand O
, O
with O
an O
air O
of O
happy O
confidence O
and O
security O
into O
that O
of O
Martin B-PERSON
, O
who O
|
     | O
snatched O
him O
up O
in O
his O
arms O
, O
with O
a O
thousand B-CARDINAL
expressions O
of O
joyful O
surprise O
  O
but O
a O
moment O
|
     | O
afterwards O
, O
when O
he O
recollected O
himself O
, O
his O
first B-ORDINAL
impulse O
was O
to O
secure O
the O
culprits O
who O
had O

     | O
decoyed O
Henry B-GPE
away O

to O
deliver O
them O
up O
to O
a O
magistrate O
for O
examination O
. O
With O
this O
|
     | O
intention O
, O
he O
looked O
hastily O
around O
, O
intending O
to O
cause O
their O
immediate O
apprehension O
  O
but O
the O
|
     | O
steam O
- O
boat O
had O
sailed O
off O
  O

all O
the O
gesticulations O
he O
could O
make O
to O
bring O
them O
back O
only O
|
     | O
caused O
the O
steward O
laughingly O
to O
shake O
his O
head O
, O
thinking O
that O
Martin B-ORG
had O
merely O
missed O
his O

passage O

At O
Portobello B-ORG
, O

, O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
had O
suffered O
agonies O
of O
grief O
, O
and O
even O
of O
self O
- O
reproach O
, O

     | O
thinking O

too O
securely O
relied O
on O
the O
safety O
of O
his O
young O
protege O
  O

with O
a O
heavy O
heart O

was O
still O
directing O

the O
most O

finding O

everything O

case O
a O
chance O
remained O
of O
his O

gentle O
pull O
at O
the O
skirt O

of O
his O
coat O

, O
on O
looking O
down O

the O

radiant O
countenance O

unutterable O
joy O

himself O
gave O
each O
his O
own O
history O
of O

strange O
adventure O

Sir O

walked O
up O

down O
in O
a O
state O
of O
irrepressible O
irritation O

At O

     | O
length O

exhausting O
his O
indignation O

took O

buried O

impenetrable O
obscurity O

They O
had O
evidently O
been O
accomplices O
in O
decoying O
him O
from O
home O
  O
and O
the O
boy O
had O
brought O
away O

     | O
from O
the O
steam O

boat O
a O
small O
book O

him O

full O

ribald O
songs O

profane O

covered O

magnificent O
boards O

clasped O

silver O

once O
belonged O
to O
some O
ancient O
missal O

collection O
of O

     | O
texts O
beautifully O
written O
in O
a O
very O
remarkable O

For O
some O
time O
afterwards O
, O
several O
suspicious O
- O
looking O
people O
were O
seen O
lurking O
about O
Sir O

     | O
Arthur B-PERSON
's O
premises O
, O
late B-TIME
at I-TIME
night I-TIME
  O
and O
one B-TIME
evening I-TIME
a O
shot O
was O
fired O
suddenly O
in O
at O
the O

     | O

which O
passed O
so O
near O
to O
Henry B-GPE

head O
, O
that O
his O
hair O
was O
actually O

     | O
disturbed O
  O

though O

not O

As O
time O
wore O
on O
, O
and O
the O
mind O
of O
Henry B-GPE
rapidly O
expanded O
on O
all O
subjects O
of O
classical O
learning O

     | O
and O
general O
science O
, O
the O
fearful O
and O
melancholy O
events O
of O
his O
early B-DATE
years I-DATE
faded O
considerably O
|
     | O
from O
his O
mind O
, O
while O
he O
made O
astonishing O
progress O
at O
the O
excellent O
school O
where O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON

     | O
placed O
him O
, O
exhibiting O
that O
happy O
, O
but O
rare O
combination O
of O
deep O
thought O
, O

refinement O

with O
extreme O
liveliness O
of O
fancy O

enthusiasm O
of O
character O

This O
threw O
a O
perfect O

     | O
witchery O
over O
his O
conversation O
, O
which O
sparkled O
with O
vivacity O

or O
flowed O
with O
uncommon O
depth O
and O

     | O
power O
, O
as O
best O
suited O
the O
occasion O

at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
during O
his O
intercourse O
with O
Sir O

     | O
Arthur B-PERSON
, O
he O
became O
imbued O
with O
the O
highest O
principles O
of O
honor O

good O

feeling O
  O

from O
his O

imbibed O
the O

of O
Christianity B-NORP

     | O
with O
the O
profoundest O
reverence O
for O
its O
precepts O

practice O
. O
| 
  | O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
felt O
a O
dreary O
blank O
during O
Henry B-ORG
's O
absence O
at O
school O
, O
which O
became O
more O
and O
more O
|
     | O
intolerable O
as O
his O
eyesight O
was O
at O
length O
nearly O
extinct O
  O
and O
he O
had O
serious O
thoughts O
of O

     | O
engaging O
a O
person O
to O
walk O
out O
with O
him O

to O
read O

him O

the O
evening O

     | O
being O
of O
opinion O
that O
it O
is O
the O
highest O
wisdom O

as O
well O

as O
much O
enjoyment O

     | O
they O
can O
afford O

| 
  | O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
often O
remarked O
to O
his O
friend O
, O
Lady B-PERSON
Towercliffe I-PERSON
, O
that O
it O
is O
a O
misfortune O
to O
wear O
|
     | O
out O
a O
taste O
of O
any O
inoffensive O
occupation O
  O
and O
he O
began O
to O
fear O
it O
might O
be O
possible O
for O
him O
to O
|
     | O
survive O
his O
enjoyment O
of O
reading O

' O
The O
time O
was O
once O
, O
when O
a O
romance O
|
     | O
carried O
me O
off O
into O
another O
existence O
altogether O
, O
and O
I O
seemed O
to O
awaken O
as O
from O
a O
dream O

when O

     | O
called O
back O
to O
the O
ordinary O

symptom O

Sir O

No O

Sir O

, O
to O
Lady B-PERSON

several O
friends O

it O
seemed O

if O
all O
the O
meritorious O
young O

at O
that O
very O

time O
to O
be O
looking O
out O
for O
precisely O
such O
a O
situation O

it O
made O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
almost O
melancholy O

     | O
in O
examining O
testimonials O

ought O

No O

Lady B-PERSON

had O
not O
some O

exactly O
suited O

no O
sooner O
did O
she O
hear O
that O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
required O
a O
secretary O

     | O
reader O
, O
than O
she O
wrote O
him O
a O
note O
of O
seven B-CARDINAL
pages O
, O
closely O
penned O
, O
in O
which O
she O
made O
it O
evident O

     | O
that O
there O
was O
but O
one B-CARDINAL
individual O
in O
the O
world O

could O
suit O

suit O

that O
one B-CARDINAL

the O

despatch O

It O

, O
with O
all O
her O
zeal O
in O
the O
cause O
, O
Lady B-PERSON
Towercliffe I-PERSON
knew O
very O
little O
of O
the O

     | O
young O
man O
she O
so O
vehemently O
recommended O
  O
but O
having O
accidentally O
met O
him O
in O
a O
bookseller O

     | O
shop O
, O
he O
had O
been O
employed O
by O
her O
to O
copy O
some O
verses O
in O
an O
album O

she O
thought O
him O

without O

     | O
exception O

one B-CARDINAL

the O
most O
civil O

really O
deserved O

encouragement O

When O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
sent O
for O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
up O
stairs O
, O
his O
kind O
heart O
was O
almost O
shocked O
at O
the O
tone O

     | O
of O
wild O
energy O
, O
and O
the O
look O
of O
feverish O
anxiety O
with O
which O
he O
entreated O
that O
his O
capabilities O

     | O
might O
be O
tried O

His O
figure O
, O
though O
youthful O
, O
was O
tall O

gaunt B-PERSON

meagre O

while O
his O
care O
- O
worn O

     | O
countenance O
, O
which O
bore O
a O
stern O

melancholy O
aspect O

lighted O
up O
by O
large O
, O
dark O
, O
flashing O

     | O
eyes O
, O
in O
which O
there O
gleamed O
an O
expression O
of O
singular O
excitement O

He O
appeared O
young O

     | O
handsome O
, O
but O
not O
prepossessing O
— O
so O
gloomy O
and O
determined O
was O
the O
expression O
of O
his O
|
     | O
firmly O
- O
compressed O
mouth O
, O
that O
it O
seemed O
almost O
indicative O
of O
ferocity O
  O
and O
his O
eye O
had O
that O

     | O
peculiarity O
invariably O
expressing O
evil O
— O
an O
impossibility O
of O
looking O
any O

in O
the O

said O
Mr. O

, O
with O
a O
look O
of O
eager O

deprecating O
solicitude O

spoke O
at O
once O
to O
the O

     | O
generous O
heart O
of O
the O
Admiral B-ORG

filled O
him O
with O
commiseration O

It O
was O
a O
favorite O
saying O
with O

be O
more O

a O
total O
incapacity O

Touched O
by O
the O
nervous O
excitement O
in O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON

eye O

manner O

he O

     | O
attributed O
entirely O

his O
necessitous O

almost O

somebody O

no O

. O
| 
  | O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
generally O
spoke O
in O
a O
subdued O
, O
mysterious O
voice O
, O
as O
if O
afraid O
to O
let O
himself O
know O
|
     | O
what O
he O
was O
saying O
  O
yet O
sometimes O
his O
words O
came O
forth O
with O
a O
rushing O
impetuosity O
, O
full O
of O
|
     | O
energy O
and O
fire O
, O
like O
lightning O
itself O
. O
His O
hollow O
, O
blood O
- O
shot O
eyes O
, O
betrayed O
a O
wild O
, O
watchful O
, O
|
     | O
suspicious O
expression O
, O
by O
no O
means O
prepossessing O
  O
and O
there O
was O
something O
inscrutable O
in O
the O
|
     | O
bland O
, O
perpetual O
smile O
he O
always O
wore O
upon O
his O
countenance O
, O
and O
in O
the O
frozen O
tranquillity O
of O
|
     | O
his O
manner O
, O
which O
occasionally O
, O
though O
seldom O
, O
gave O
way O
to O
bursts O
of O
tempestuous O
emotion O
. O
The O
|
     | O
very O
pupils O
of O
his O
eyes O
seemed O
to O
have O
become O
darker O
, O
with O
a O
fearfully O
wild O
and O
ferocious O
|
     | O
expression O
when O
irritated O
, O
while O
the O
fierce O
fire O
flashed O
out O
from O
beneath O
his O
lowering O
brows O
, O
|
     | O
with O
a O
blaze O
of O
inexpressible O
fury O
  O
yet O
in O
a O
moment O
he O
could O
command O
himself O
again O
into O
a O
cold O
, O
|
     | O
calm O
, O
and O
almost O
haughty O
exterior O
, O
while O
the O
spectral O
paleness O
of O
his O
handsome O
countenance O
made O
|
     | O
him O
look O
like O
marble O
itself O
. O
| 
  | O
Years O
passed O
on O
, O
during O
which O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
endured O
, O
rather O
than O
enjoyed O
, O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON

|
     | O
attendance O
, O
whose O
pre O
- O
occupied O
air O
and O
vague O
manner O
continually O
annoyed O
him O
  O
but O
his O
benevolent O
|
     | O
heart O
shrunk O
from O
consigning O
the O
poor O
man O
to O
that O
hopeless O
and O
solitary O
want O
which O
he O
seemed O
to O
|
     | O
apprehend O
must O
inevitably O
follow O
the O
loss O
of O
his O
present O
situation O
, O
and O
from O
day O
to O
day O
he O
|
     | O
postponed O
the O
decision O
, O
till O
habit O
grew O
into O
second B-ORDINAL
nature O
, O
and O
he O
became O
so O
accustomed O
to O
hear O
|
     | O
" O
The O
Times B-ORG
, O
" O
column O
after O
column O
, O
spouted O
forth O
in O
a O
rather O
theatrical O
tone O
by O
his O
reader O
, O
and O
|
     | O
to O
dictate O
notes O
and O
letters O
to O
his O
very O
silent O
and O
diligent O
secretary O
, O
that O
he O
almost O
forgot O

     | O
at O
last O
to O
think O
of O
parting O
with O
him O
. O

When O
Henry B-PERSON
returned O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
from O
school O
, O
six B-DATE
or I-DATE
seven I-DATE
months I-DATE
after O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
had O
|
     | O
become O
domesticated O
at O
Portobello B-ORG
, O
the O
secretary O
professed O
a O
vehement O
fancy O
for O
the O
boy O
, O
would O
|
     | O
fetch O
and O
carry O
for O
him O
like O
a O
tame O
dog O
, O
and O
loaded O
him O
with O
attentions O
  O
yet O
, O
though O
in O
general O
|
     | O
most O
affectionately O
grateful O
to O
all O
who O
showed O
him O
even O
a O
trifling O
kindness O
, O
these O
assiduities O
|
     | O
and O
flatteries O
were O
lavished O
upon O
him O
in O
vain O
. O
The O
boy O
shrunk O
instinctively O
from O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
's O
|
     | O
notice O
, O
but O
could O
assign O
no O
other O
reason O
to O
himself O
or O
others O
for O
this O
apparently O
unreasonable O
|
     | O
antipathy O
, O
except O
merely O
that O
the O
stranger O
resembled O
somebody O
he O
had O
seen O
before O
, O
but O
how O
, O

     | O
when O
, O
or O
where O
, O
not O
a O
trace O
remained O
in O
his O
memory O
. O
This O
little O
caprice O
did O
not O
appear O
to O
be O
|
     | O
noticed O
or O
resented O
by O
the O
secretary O
, O
till O
one B-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
when O
Henry B-PERSON
refused O
some O
bon O
- O
bons O
which O
Mr. O

     | O
Howard B-PERSON
offered O
him O
, O
saying O
, O
the O
last O
he O
accepted O
had O
made O
him O
sick O
, O
and O
when O
the O
boy O
soon O
after O
|
     | O
flew O
gaily O
out O
of O
the O
room O
, O
Marion B-PERSON
was O
for O
a O
moment O
startled O
and O
surprised O
to O
observe O
the O
|
     | O
malignant O
scowl O
with O
which O
the O
eye O
of O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
followed O
Henry B-PERSON
. O
It O
was O
a O
glance O
, O
fell O
and O
|
     | O
malignant O
, O
that O
feared O
to O
be O
seen O
, O
while O
his O
cheek O
became O
pale O
as O
death O
, O
but O
whether O
in O
anger O
|
     | O
or O
in O
sorrow O
, O
Marion B-PERSON
thought O
it O
impossible O
to O
divine O
. O
| 
  | O
As O
Henry B-PERSON
grew O
older O
, O
his O
instinctive O
dread O
of O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
seemed O
only O
to O
increase O
, O
but O
he O
was O
|
     | O
too O
considerate O
to O
disturb O
the O
tranquillity O
of O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
by O
mentioning O
it O
, O
or O
to O
injure O
the O
|
     | O
poor O
man O
himself O
, O
by O
giving O
way O
to O
a O
feeling O
of O
dislike O
so O
unaccountable O
, O
and O
yet O
so O
perfectly O
|
     | O
unconquerable O
  O
but O
at O
length O
, O
after O
many B-DATE
years I-DATE
of O
such O
prudent O
self O
- O
restraint O
, O
when O
nearly O
|
     | O
grown O
up O
to O
manhood O
he O
could O
not O
help O
saying O
one B-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
in O
a O
careless O
tone O
, O
to O
the O
Admiral B-ORG
, O
after O
|
     | O
witnessing O
a O
sudden O
outbreak O
of O
temper O
in O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
that O
morning O
, O
| 
  | O
" O
Your O
secretary O
always O
reminds O
me O
, O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
, O
of O
Sinbad B-GPE
's O
Old O
Man O
of O
the O
Sea O
. O
It O
seems O
|
     | O
impossible O
to O
get O
handsomely O
rid O
of O
him O
, O
and O
he O
will O
never O
certainly O
make O
a O
voluntary O

     | O
departure O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
fear O
not O
! O
" O
replied O
the O
Admiral B-ORG
, O
with O
something O
between O
a O
smile O
and O
a O
sigh O
. O
" O
He O
does O
all O
I O
|
     | O
desire O
him O
, O
but O
without O
interest O
or O
pleasure O
, O
and O
he O
has O
the O
most O
undisguised O
contempt O
for O
|
     | O
every O
living O
being O
, O
almost O
amounting O
to O
hatred O
, O
yet O
he O
expresses O
unbounded O
gratitude O
for O
being O
|
     | O
harbored O
in O
my O
house O
. O
What O
can O
I O
do O
? O
It O
would O
be O
cruel O
to O
kick O
the O
man O
out O
of O
doors O
, O
merely O
|
     | O
because O
he O
is O
unhappy O
  O
but O
I O
have O
often O
observed O
, O
Henry B-PERSON
, O
that O
he O
is O
no O
favorite O
of O
yours O
, O
|
     | O
though O
that O
is O
the O
only O
subject O
on O
which O
you O
have O
never O
been O
entirely O
open O
with O
me O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Because O
I O
am O
heartily O
ashamed O
of O
my O
feelings O
, O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
, O
and O
you O
are O
the O
last O
person O
on O
|
     | O
earth O
to O
whom O
I O
wish O
to O
tell O
anything O
against O
myself O

You O
have O
told O
me O
there O
are O
people O
with O
a O
|
     | O
loathing O
antipathy O
to O
cats O
, O
and O
somewhat O
similar O
is O
the O
shuddering O
sensation O
with O
which O
I O
see O
|
     | O
your O
worthy O
secretary O
enter O
the O
room O
. O
A O
sort O
of O
shiver O
comes O
over O
me O
, O
and O
a O
wish O
to O
keep O
him O
|
     | O
off O
— O
to O
avoid O
his O
very O
glance O
and O
touch O
. O
He O
has O
a O
strange O
under O
- O
look O
certainly O
! O
His O
smile O
makes O
|
     | O
me O
shudder O
! O
and O
yet O
the O
feeling O
is O
quite O
undefinable O
! O
They O
say O
dogs O
and O
children O
have O
an O
|
     | O
instinctive O
liking O
or O
antipathy O
to O
those O
who O
secretly O
like O
or O
hate O
them O
, O
and O
perhaps O
my O
|
     | O
sensation O
is O
on O
somewhat O
similar O
grounds O

" O
There O
is O
something O
fearful O

the O
eye O

when O
I O
catch O
it O

added O
Henry B-GPE
rapidly O
, O
but O
in O
a O
sort O
of O
musing O
, O
absent O
under O
- O
tone O
, O
while O
his O
voice O

     | O
acquired O
a O
deeper O
tinge O
of O
thought O

" O
I O

beheld O
him O
once O

dream O

he O
looks O

     | O
at O
me O
in O
that O
strange O

extraordinary O
manner O
, O
his O
eyes O
like O
the O
flickering O
glare O
of O
light O
in O

     | O
a O
gloomy O
cavern O
, O
I O
feel O

know O
that O
at O
some O
period O

my O
life O

such O
a O
countenance O

before O

The O
time O

place O
have O
escaped O
me O

the O
remembrance O
is O
painful O

in O
his O
presence O

I O
can O
not O

be O
convinced O
that O
I O
am O

the O
presence O

enemy O

It O
is O
a O
feeling O

can O
neither O

drive O
away O

distinctly O

you O
never O
tell O
me O
this O
before O

Henry B-PERSON

" O
asked O
the O
Admiral B-ORG

rising O
with O
agitation O

" O
He O

in O
the O
mean O
time O

Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
, O
he O
does O
occasionally O
look O
to O
me O
, O
very O

     | O
like O
some O
stray O
member O
of O
the B-ORG

! O
" O

Henry B-PERSON
in O
his O
usual O
off O

hand O

Mr. O

     | O
Howard B-PERSON
, O
stood O
before O
him O

A O
mortal O
paleness O
had O
overspread O
his O
countenance O
, O
contending O
emotions O

     | O
seemed O
flitting O
across O
his O
lowering O
brow O
, O
like O
shifting O
clouds O
in O
a O
threatening O
sky O
, O
and O
his O

     | O
eye O
gleamed O
upon O
young O
De B-PERSON
Lancey I-PERSON
with O
a O
look O
of O
maniacal O
fury O
  O
but O
the O
same O
artificial O
smile O

     | O
was O
on O
his O
lips O

he O
habitually O
assumed O
, O
while O
, O
in O
the O
blandest O
tone O
of O
courtesy O

he O
turned O

with O
a O
certain O
tone O

abhorred O

always O
had O

him O
from O
perceiving O
that O
in O
the O
countenance O

there O
flitted O

gnawed O
his O

nether O

frightful O
vehemence O

his O

shot O
fire O

frowning O

brow O

With O
a O
glance O

malevolence O
at O

a O
hurried O
bow O

Sir O

truly O
astonishing O
how O

not O

Thus O
the O
foundation O

was O
laid O

these O
were O

ruffled O

the O

enchanted O

Plunged O
in O
this O
inextricable O

all O
the O

     | O
could O

her O
flexible O

richly O

voice O

     | O
poured O
out O
sometimes O
a O
flood O
of O
harmony O
most O
exquisite O
to O
hear O
, O
as O
the O
pathos O
of O
her O
full O

drew O
forth O
the O

these O

The O
Admiral B-ORG
was O
thought O

by O
Mrs. O

a O
sad O
marplot O

having O
already O

Sir O

he O
said O
the O
only O
knowledge O

, O
that O
knowledge O

ruins O
the O
heart O

where O
fascination O

     | O
was O
to O
be O
taught O
as O
one O

all O
his O

Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
, O
being O
the O
guardian O
of O
both O
his O
sisters O
, O
had O
determined O
to O

     | O
expend O
a O
considerable O
part O
of O
the O
provision O
bequeathed O
by O
their O

in O
training O
them O
up O

     | O
carefully O
, O
for O
the O
course O
of O
fashionable O
life O

as O
he O
would O
have O
trained O
a O
promising O
race O

     | O
which O
was O
expected O
to O
win O
the O
St. B-GPE

confidently O
anticipating O
a O
short O
and O
brilliant O
career O

     | O
of O
admiration O
and O
success O
, O
ending O
with O
a O
splendid O
trousseau O
, O
a O
chariot O

four B-CARDINAL

a O

Even O
the O
gay O

frolicsome O
Caroline B-PERSON
Smythe I-PERSON
, O
many O
years O
older O
than O
Marion O

and O
the O
most O

     | O
seditious O
and O
unruly O
of O
pupils O
, O
became O
speedily O
tamed O
down O
to O
mechanical O
obedience O
at O
school O
, O
|
     | O
where O
, O
losing O
her O
naturally O
intense O
enjoyment O
of O
mere O
existence O
, O
she O
seemed O
at O
best O
almost O
a O
|
     | O
habitual O
drudge O
in O
the O
usual O
routine O
of O
labor O
. O
There O
was O
a O
mystery O
never O
apparently O
to O
be O
|
     | O
fathomed O
about O
this O
lively O
girl O
, O
which O
excited O
the O
most O
intense O
curiosity O
among O
her O
companions O
, O
|
     | O
but O
though O
she O
was O
gifted O
with O
an O
extraordinary O
degree O
of O
volubility O
, O
which O
astonished O
and O
|
     | O
diverted O
the O
whole O
school O
, O
talking O
in O
a O
rapid O
and O
irregular O
manner O
of O
all O
events O
, O
past O
, O
|
     | O
present O
, O
or O
to O
come O
, O
with O
a O
brilliant O
confusion O
of O
drollery O
and O
humor O
, O
still O
she O
never O
dropped O
|
     | O
a O
hint O
which O
threw O
the O
most O
transient O
light O
on O
her O
own O
situation O
and O
affairs O
. O
No O
one O
knew O
|
     | O
whence O
she O
came O
or O
who O
she O
was O
, O
but O
though O
defying O
all O
the O
powers O
of O
all O
the O
masters O
to O
render O
|
     | O
her O
accomplished O
, O
yet O
Mrs. O
Penfold B-PERSON
evidently O
treated O
her O
with O
extraordinary O
consideration O
, O
and O
|
     | O
almost O
with O
respect O
. O
| 
  | O
Many O
were O
the O
restrictions O
and O
directions O
given O
respecting O
her O
to O
the O
scholars O
and O
teachers O
, O
|
     | O
which O
seemed O
to O
them O
most O
unaccountable O
, O
and O
several O
of O
which O
were O
voted O
by O
the O
juvenile O
|
     | O
community O
to O
be O
so O
peculiarly O
barbarous O
and O
oppressive O
, O
that O
though O
the O
young O
lady O
herself O
|
     | O
seemed O
neither O
surprised O
nor O
annoyed O
by O
the O
rigid O
watchfulness O
exercised O
over O
all O
her O
motions O
, O
|
     | O
it O
excited O
among O
her O
companions O
an O
indignant O
pity O
, O
and O
a O
keen O
spirit O
of O
partizanship O
. O
She O
was O

     | O
never O
on O
any O
occasion O
known O
to O
walk O
with O
the O

beyond O

instead O

was O

eager O
scrutiny O

it O
increased O
in O
weight O

" O
the O
mortifying O
fact O

forced O
itself O
upon O

An O
appeal O
to O
Sir O

for O
his O
interference O
often O
occasionally O
suggested O
itself O
to O
the O
mind O

     | O
of O
Marion B-ORG
  O
but O
she O
knew O
that O
his O
influence O
was O
less O
than O
nothing O
, O
and O
she O
greatly O
feared O
lest O
|
     | O
his O
vehement O
partiality O
to O
herself O
might O
lead O
him O
to O
overlook O
the O
very O
limited O
nature O
of O
his O

     | O
income O
, O

to O
volunteer O
some O

sacrifice O

would O
rather O
suffer O

The O
pension O

half B-CARDINAL

pay O
of O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
very O
barely O
sufficed O
, O
she O

     | O
knew O
, O
to O
defray O
his O
extensive O
charities O
, O

to O
furnish O
sometimes O

bottle O

round O

it O
was O
his O
delight O
to O
gather O
a O
frequent O
circle O
of O
old O

     | O
brother O
admirals O
  O
but O
his O
purse O
was O
little O
calculated O
to O
stand O
the O
shock O
of O
such O
a O
draft O
as O
Sir O

Patrick B-PERSON
would O
unhesitatingly O
have O
drawn O

the O
idea O
occurred O
to O
him O
that O

Scarcely O

the O
young O
Baronet B-ORG
mechanically O

out O

Marion B-PERSON

at O

still O
not O

desperate O
at O

anxiety O

Marion B-PERSON

     | O
with O
glowing O
cheeks O

remind O
Sir O

for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
, O
of O
their O

     | O
little O
pecuniary O

which O
was O
so O
very O
trifling O
that O
he O

probably O
forgotten O

it O

" O
You O

he O

angrily O

throwing O
down O

excuse O

whenever O

out O

all O
on O
her O
unoffending O
pupil O

     | O
whose O
sensitive O

so O
imbued O
at O

vexation O

anxiety O

that O
on O

sixteen O

she O
ventured O
to O
pen O
an O
earnest O
appeal O
to O
Sir O

, O
begging O
with O
all O
the O

     | O
eloquence O
of O
natural O
feeling O
, O
that O
if O
the O

inconvenient O

she O

This O

cost O
Marion B-ORG
agonies O

with O
a O
sigh O

she O
dismissed O
the O

     | O
and O
trying O

hope O
the O

quietly O
resumed O
the O

consolatory O
reflection O

respecting O
the O

most O

great O

been O
taken O
to O

them O
, O
though O

     | O
the O

seemed O
wanting O
in O
both O
girls O

being O
already O
surfeited O
with O
admiration O

     | O
panegyric O
among O
their O
masters O

governesses O

who O
vied O
with O
each O

in O
praising O
their O
two B-CARDINAL

     | O
most O
advanced O
pupils O

     | O
employment O

| 
  | O
Marion B-ORG
had O
strolled O
one B-TIME
evening I-TIME
with O
Caroline B-GPE
, O
farther O
than O
Miss O
Smythe O
had O
ever O
been O
known O
|
     | O
to O
venture O
before O
  O
and O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
young O
friends O
were O
seated O
in O
an O
arbor O
at O
the O
extreme O
verge O
of O
|
     | O
the O
bounds O
prescribed O
by O
Mrs. O
Penfold B-PERSON
, O
in O
earnest O
conversation O
, O
while O
watching O
with O
delight O
the O
|
     | O
declining O
sun O
, O
which O
superbly O
illuminated O
a O
heavy O
mass O
of O
clouds O
in O
the O
western O
horizon O
. O
Time O
|
     | O
flew O
on O
, O
and O
darkness O
nearly O
closed O
around O
them O
while O
they O
discussed O
with O
lively O
, O
careless O
|
     | O
humor O
, O
all O
the O
petty O
annoyances O
of O
their O
daily O
life O
, O
and O
compared O
the O
little O
hopes O
and O
fears O
|
     | O
they O
entertained O
for O
the O
future O
. O
As O
the B-TIME
hour I-TIME
became O
later O
, O
Marion B-PERSON
felt O
that O
the O
high O
|
     | O
exhilarating O
key O
in O
which O
Caroline B-GPE
spoke O
, O
and O
her O
gay O
, O
well O
- O
rung O
- O
out O
laugh O
, O
made O
her O
almost O
|
     | O
nervous O
in O
the O
obscure O
and O
solitary O
retreat O
to O
which O
they O
had O
withdrawn O
  O
but O
ashamed O
of O
her O
own O
|
     | O
timidity O
, O
she O
determined O
to O
conquer O
or O
conceal O
it O
. O
| 
  | O
Marion B-ORG
was O
flattered O
when O
a O
companion O
like O
Caroline B-PERSON
, O
some B-DATE
years I-DATE
older O
than O
herself O
, O
thus O
|
     | O
treated O
her O
with O
familiarity O
  O
though O
certainly O
, O
neither O
on O
this O
occasion O
, O
nor O
on O
any O
other O
, O
was O
|
     | O
it O
with O
confidence O
, O
as O
no O
living O
being O
seemed O
entirely O
in O
the O
confidence O
of O
Miss B-PERSON
Smythe I-PERSON
, O
who O
, O
|
     | O
while O
she O
appeared O
gayly O
and O
heedlessly O
to O
rattle O
on O
in O
conversation O
, O
yet O
kept O
a O
cautious O
|
     | O
silence O
respecting O
all O
that O
concerned O
herself O
. O
| 
  | O
Many O
very O
reserved O
persons O
pass O
for O
being O
perfectly O
open O
, O
by O
means O
of O
a O
frank O
, O
free O
manner O
, O
|
     | O
and O
by O
speaking O
in O
a O
confidential O
tone O
concerning O
the O
most O
private O
affairs O
of O
those O
with O
whom O
|
     | O
they O
converse O
  O
and O
this O
Caroline B-PERSON
did O
to O
excess O
, O
asking O
Marion B-ORG
, O
with O
every O
appearance O
of O
|
     | O
kindness O
, O
a O
hundred B-CARDINAL
questions O
, O
which O
in O
her O
own O
case O
she O
either O
could O
not O
, O
or O
would O
not O
have O
|
     | O
answered O
, O
and O
testifying O
the O
most O
cordial O
, O
unfeigned O
interest O
in O
all O
that O
related O
to O
the O
|
     | O
prospects O
or O
feelings O
of O
her O
companion O
, O
who O
never O
attempted O
to O
conceal O
a O
wish O
or O
a O
thought O
, O
and O
|
     | O
often O
forgot O
that O
the O
trust O
was O
not O
mutual O
. O
| 
  | O
Caroline B-PERSON
was O
talking O
eagerly O
with O
great O
animation O
, O
and O
telling O
Marion B-PERSON
that O
the O
only O
injury O
|
     | O
she O
never O
would O
forgive O
, O
was O
, O
if O
any O
of O
those O
she O
loved O
had O
a O
sorrow O
that O
did O
not O
allow O
her O
to O
|
     | O
share O
with O
them O
  O
and O
especially O
if O
they O
permitted O
themselves O
to O
suffer O
from O
any O
pecuniary O
|
     | O
difficulties O
which O
it O
was O
within O
her O
power O
to O
relieve O
, O
when O
suddenly O
Marion B-ORG
laid O
a O
hand O
on O
her O
|
     | O
arm O
, O
making O
a O
hurried O
signal O
for O
silence O
, O
while O
she O
whispered O
in O
a O
low O
undertone O
, O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
have O
scarcely O
heard O

Did O
you O
observe O

strange O

looking O

     | O
man O
, O
very O
much O
muffled O
up O

who O
scrambled O
several B-TIME
minutes I-TIME

to O
the O
top O
of O
the O
garden O
- O
wall O
? O
He O

     | O
was O
staring O
wildly O
about O
him O
for O
some O
time O
, O
then O
gliding O
noiselessly O
down O
, O
and O
has O
suddenly O

     | O
disappeared O
? O
" O

" O
Where O

whispered O
Caroline B-PERSON
, O
grasping O
Marion B-ORG
's O
hand O
with O
a O
look O
of O
wild O
alarm O
, O
and O
|
     | O
speaking O
in O
a O
low O
, O
hoarse O
tone O
of O
extreme O
terror O
. O
" O
For O
your O

Who O

asked O
Marion B-PERSON
, O
bewildered O
and O
terrified O
, O
when O
she O
beheld O
a O
degree O
of O
frantic O
alarm O

     | O
depicted O
on O
the O
countenance O
of O
her O
companion O

seemed O
almost O
unaccountable O

Caroline B-PERSON
seemed O
to O
have O
lost O
all O
command O
of O
herself O
in O
the O
agony O
of O
her O
fear O
, O
and O
poured O
out O

     | O
a O
flood O
of O
words O
in O
the O
rapid O
and O
subdued O
accents O
of O
extreme O
terror O
, O
while O
she O
retreated O
into O

     | O
the O
darkest O
corner O
of O
the O
arbor O
to O
screen O
herself O
from O
observation O
, O
hastily O
dragging O
Marion B-PERSON

     | O
along O
with O
her O
, O
and O
whispering O
an O
eager O
request O
, O
if O
they O
were O
discovered O
, O
that O
she O
would O

     | O
endeavor O
herself O
to O
get O
off O

fly O
towards O
the O
house O

assistance O

I O
shall O
engage O

     | O
his O
attention O

he O
once O
sees O
me O

all O
hope O

escape O

my O
part O

be O
vain O

the O

very O

In O
agonized O
suspense O
and O
apprehension O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
friends O
remained O
during O
several B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
, O

     | O
cowering O
behind O
the O
overhanging O
branches O
, O
and O
scarcely O
venturing O
to O
breathe O
, O
while O
Caroline B-PERSON

     | O
bent O
her O
head O
eagerly O
forward O
to O
catch O
the O
slightest O
sound O
, O
and O
grasped O
Marion B-ORG
's O
arm O
almost O
|
     | O
convulsively O
, O
as O
if O
to O
secure O
her O
being O
perfectly O
immovable O
  O
at O
length O
, O
after O
some O
time O
, O
she O
|
     | O
heaved O
a O
deep O
sigh O
, O
expressive O
of O
relief O
, O
and O
looked O
up O
, O
saying O

" O
He O
is O
surely O
gone O

he O
must O
be O
gone O
! O
I O
never O
eluded O
his O
eye O

sight O

almost O

supernatural O

Marion B-ORG

in O
an O
under O
tone O

" O
I O
heard O

over O

said O
Caroline B-PERSON

with O
sudden O

     | O
energy O
, O

rising O

drawing O
herself O
up O

her O
full O
height O

with O
resolute O
countenance O

her O
limbs O

trembled O
beneath O

walked O
towards O

door O

in O
a O

     | O
loud O

a O
tall O
man O

much O
muffled O
up O
in O
a O
loose O
great O
- O
coat O

who O
had O
now O

at O
the O
door O
, O
" O

there O

in O
tones O
of O
remonstrance O

replied O
the O
stranger O
, O
in O
a O
voice O
which O
sounded O
harsh O
and O

     | O
excited O
, O
while O
the O
deep O
, O
full O
tones O
appeared O
to O
Marion B-ORG
as O
if O
she O
had O
heard O
them O
before O

the O

     | O
darkness O
prevented O
her O
from O
seeing O
him O
distinctly O

even O
if O
his O
dress O

not O
been O
sufficient O

him O

penetrating O
eye O

increasing O
wildness O

The O
madman O

voice O

loud O

vehement O

dropped O
into O
a O
low O
, O
stern O

     | O
inaudible O
murmur O

and O
his O
hand O
plunged O
into O
the O
breast O
of O
his O
coat O

seemed O
as O
if O
it O

Marion B-ORG

taking O

off O

speed O

almost O

loud O

angry O
cry O

to O
stop O

mingled O
with O
curses O

from O
the O
madman O

he O
waved O
his O

     | O
singularly O
long O
arms O
menacingly O
above O
his O
head O

only O
accelerated O
her O
pace O

while O
he O
followed O

     | O
some O
steps O

pursuit O

instantly O
rang O

dinner O

alarm O

moment O

in O
explanation O

for O
Mrs. O

at O
once O

guess O
the O

     | O
whole O
nature O

extent O
of O
Caroline B-GPE

danger O

the O
instant O
her O
name O
was O
mentioned O

therefore O

     | O
Marion O
had O
but O
to O
point O
out O
the O
direction O
in O
which O
she O
might O
be O
found O
, O
when O
Mrs. O
Penfold B-PERSON

     | O
hastened O
forward O

preceded O
by O
several O
of O

more O
active O
servants O

When O
Marion O

rapidly O
executed O
some O
orders O
committed O
to O
her O

quickly O
returned O
towards O

the O
arbor O

not O
a O
trace O
remained O
there O
of O
any O
one O

little O
table O

been O
upset O

several O

     | O
branches O
torn O
down O
that O
surrounded O
the O
entrance O

and O
the O
grass O
beneath O
was O
much O
trampled O
and O

     | O
disfigured O
  O

all O
was O
silent O

deserted O

one B-CARDINAL
hurried O
glance O
of O
alarm O

perplexity O
, O
|
     | O
Marion B-ORG
hastened O
forward O
to O
the B-FAC
garden I-FAC
gate I-FAC

found O

been O
violently O
burst O

     | O
on O
emerging O
into O
the O
high O
road O

there O
found O
Mrs. O

all O

     | O
crowding O
round O
Caroline B-PERSON

who O
remained O
in O
a O
dead O
faint O
on O
the O
ground O
for O
nearly B-CARDINAL
half I-CARDINAL
an O

     | O
hour O

A O
carriage O

rapidly O
disappearing O
at O
full O
speed O
in O
the O
distance O
, O

already O
almost O
too O
far O

     | O
off O
to O
be O
distinguished O
  O
and O
Marion B-PERSON
perceived O
the O
figure O
of O
a O
man O
lurking O
behind O
the O
hedge O

     | O
close O
beside O
her O
  O
but O
when O
she O
made O
it O
evident O
that O
he O
was O
observed O
, O
he O
rushed O
close O
up O
to O
her O
|
     | O
side O
, O
saying O
, O
in O
a O
threatening O
tone O

between O
his O
clenched O
teeth O
, O
" O

provoked O

time O

utter O
an O
exclamation O

sudden O
affright O

before O
he O
sprung O
over O

the O
hedge O

was O
seen O
running O
across O
the O
neighboring O
fields O

until O
his O
figure O
mingled O
with O

the O
surrounding O
gloom O
, O

vanished O
out O
of O
sight O

Mrs. O

chief O
care O
, O
after O
Caroline B-PERSON

recovery O
from O
her O
alarming O
swoon O
, O
was O
earnestly O

     | O
to O
enjoin O
that O
the O
circumstances O
of O
this O
adventure O
should O
never O
be O
mentioned O

so O
much O

extraordinary O

alarming O

being O
likely O

to O
injure O
her O
establishment O

besides O
causing O
much O
unnecessary O
gossip O
among O
the O
younger O
pupils O
  O

but O
had O
Marion B-ORG
ever O
been O
disposed O
to O
consign O

as O
desired O
, O
the O
whole O
adventure O
to O
oblivion O
, O
she O

     | O
could O
not O

be O
continually O
reminded O
of O
it O
for O
several B-DATE
weeks I-DATE

, O
by O
the O
startled O

agitated O
manner O
of O
Caroline B-GPE
, O
whose O
frolicsome O
spirits O
had O
entirely O
deserted O
her O
, O
while O
she O

     | O
seemed O
for O
some O
time O
to O
be O
in O
imminent O
danger O
of O
a O
nervous O
fever O

If O
any O
one B-CARDINAL
appeared O
suddenly O

     | O
in O
the O
room O

she O
almost O
screamed O
with O
the O
start O

could O
not O
bear O
for O
a O

safe O
in O
the O

for O
the O

Gradually O
, O
however O
, O
her O
mind O
became O
more O
composed O

     | O

she O
ventured O
one B-DATE

take O

some O
of O

hastily O
round O

approach O
in O
that O
direction O
, O
and O
with O
equal O
care O
did O
she O
avoid O
any O
|
     | O
allusion O
to O
what O
had O
occurred O
there O
, O
not O
a O
hint O
of O
which O
ever O
transpired O
in O
her O
most O
|
     | O
confidential O
moments O
. O
The O
very O
sound O
of O
her O
own O
feet O
on O
the O
gravel O
seemed O
to O
startle O
her O
, O
and O
|
     | O
as O
she O
walked O
beneath O
the O
shade O
of O
some O
tall O
forest O
trees O
which O
overhung O
the O
garden O
- O
wall O
, O
|
     | O
Marion O
observed O
that O
Caroline B-GPE
trod O
more O
cautiously O
  O
and O
though O
she O
dropped O
not O
a O
word O
|
     | O
respecting O
her O
feelings O
or O
fears O
, O
it O
was O
evident O
that O
her O
nerves O
were O
strung O
to O
an O
agony O
of O
|
     | O
sensitiveness O
, O
for O
the O
fluttering O
of O
a O
bird O
in O
the O
hedge O
, O
or O
the O
fall O
of O
a O
leaf O
, O
made O
her O
|
     | O
start O
, O
and O
she O
seemed O
about O
at O
last O
to O
give O
up O
the O
point O
in O
despair O
, O
and O
hurry O
homewards O
, O
when O
|
     | O
suddenly O
a O
loud O
shrill O
whistle O
arose O
amidst O
the O
branches O
of O
an O
ash O
- O
tree O
, O
almost O
directly O
over O
|
     | O
their O
heads O
, O
and O
before O
Marion B-ORG
had O
time O
to O
look O
round O
, O
a O
small O
packet O
had O
dropped O
at O
the O
feet O
|
     | O
of O
Caroline B-GPE
. O
| 
  | O
With O
a O
half B-CARDINAL
- O
suppressed O
cry O
of O
alarm O
, O
the O
terrified O
girl O
fled O
, O
while O
Marion B-ORG
, O
scarcely O
less O
|
     | O
frightened O
, O
instinctively O
picked O
up O
the O
parcel O
, O
and O
followed O
, O
while O
again O
she O
was O
pursued O
by O
a O
|
     | O
volley O
of O
oaths O
and O
imprecations O
, O
which O
ended O
in O
a O
laugh O
so O
wild O
, O
so O
maniacal O
, O
and O
so O
fearful O
, O
|
     | O
that O
for O
months B-DATE
afterwards O
it O
rung O
in O
her O
ears O
, O
causing O
her O
a O
shudder O
of O
horror O
and O
alarm O
. O
| 
  | O
When O
Mrs. O
Penfold B-PERSON
tore O
open O
an O
innumerable O
multitude O
of O
seals O
which O
closed O
the O
packet O
|
     | O
addressed O
to O
Caroline B-GPE
, O
she O
discovered O
within O
only O
a O
long O
incoherent O
letter O
of O
several O
sheets O
, O
|
     | O
filled O
with O
the O
most O
extravagant O
professions O
of O
ardent O
love O
, O
and O
the O
most O
vehement O
|
     | O
declarations O
, O
that O
nothing O
on O
earth O
could O
impede O
or O
discourage O
him O
in O
his O
resolution O
to O
carry O
|
     | O
her O
off O
, O
which O
he O
seemed O
still O
persuaded O
, O
with O
the O
self O
- O
delusion O
peculiar O
to O
madness O
, O
must O
be O
a O
|
     | O
welcome O
assurance O
to O
Caroline B-GPE
, O
whose O
words O
and O
actions O
he O
perseveringly O
attributed O
to O
the O
|
     | O
arbitrary O
influence O
of O
others O
. O
Accompanying O
this O
farrago O
of O
most O
intolerable O
nonsense O
, O
was O
a O
|
     | O
black O
shade O
in O
a O
wooden O
frame O
, O
representing O
the O
profile O
of O
a O
young O
man O
, O
certainly O
handsome O
, O
and O
|
     | O
which O
seemed O
to O
Marion O
like O
features O
she O
had O
known O
elsewhere O
, O
but O
being O
frequently O
addicted O
to O
|
     | O
observing O
resemblances O
, O
she O
felt O
at O
once O
persuaded O
that O
this O
must O
be O
some O
such O
vague O
and O
|
     | O
unaccountable O
likeness O
as O
she O
had O
frequently O
found O
or O
fancied O
before O
. O
| 
  | O
Time O
wore O
on O
, O
and O
still O
Caroline B-PERSON
lingered O
at O
school O
, O
unwilling O
apparently O
to O
forsake O
the O
|
     | O
comparative O
quietness O
of O
Mrs. O
Penfold B-PERSON
's O
, O
where O
, O
though O
her O
age O
exceeded O
by O
some B-DATE
years I-DATE
that O
of O
|
     | O
the O
other O
pupils O
, O
and O
though O
her O
cotemporary O
Clara B-PERSON
had O
been O
already O
introduced O
into O
society O
, O
|
     | O
she O
still O
seemed O
anxious O
to O
forget O
herself O
and O
her O
affairs O
in O
the O
multitude O
of O
her O
masters O
and O
|
     | O
studies O
, O
so O
completely O
was O
she O
engrossed O
by O
which O
, O
that O
she O
evidently O
grudged O
every O
moment O
and O
|
     | O
every O
thought O
which O
interrupted O
her O
progress O
. O
At O
length O
, O
on O
the O
evening O
previous O
to O
that O
fixed O
|
     | O
on O
for O
her O
final O
departure O
from O
school O
, O
when O
Mrs. O
Smythe B-PERSON
was O
expected O
to O
convey O
her O
home O
, O
Mrs. O
|
     | O
Penfold B-PERSON
was O
bestowing O
on O
Caroline B-GPE
some O
of O
her O
last O
advice O
, O
of O
the O
most O
approved O
mode O
of O
|
     | O
" O
getting O
on O
" O
in O
society O
, O
and O
especially O
on O
the O
manners O
and O
conversation O
most O
attractive O
to O
|
     | O
gentlemen O
, O
when O
a O
note O
was O
brought O
into O
the O
room O
, O
which O
had O
arrived O
by O
express O
, O
bringing O
the O
|
     | O
melancholy O
intelligence O
that O
Mrs. O
Smythe B-PERSON
's O
carriage O
had O
been O
upset O
a B-QUANTITY
few I-QUANTITY
miles I-QUANTITY
off O
, O
causing O
so O
|
     | O
severe O
a O
blow O
on O
the O
head O
, O
that O
a O
concussion O
of O
the O
brain O
had O
taken O
place O
, O
and O
she O
continued O
|
     | O
insensible O
, O
at O
a O
village O
some B-QUANTITY
miles I-QUANTITY
off O
, O
where O
little O
hope O
remained O
of O
her O
recovery O
. O
The O
Doctor O
|
     | O
who O
wrote O
these O
hurried O
particulars O
had O
obligingly O
sent O
his O
own O
carriage O
and O
servant O
to O
|
     | O
accompany O
Miss O
Smythe O
to O
the O
spot O
, O
that O
she O
might O
take O
a O
last O
leave O
of O
her O
dying O
relative O
, O
and O
|
     | O
he O
recommended O
that O
she O
should O
not O
lose O
an O
instant O
, O
or O
it O
might O
be O
too O
late O
to O
find O
the O

     | O
sufferer O
in O
life O
. O
| 
  | O
Struck O
with O
grief O
and O
consternation O
by O
this O
most O
unexpected O
and O
calamitous O
intelligence O
, O
|
     | O
Caroline B-PERSON
, O
though O
she O
had O
never O
before O
seemed O
much O
to O
love O
her O
aunt O
, O
yet O
now O
became O
overwhelmed O
|
     | O
with O
the O
shock O
, O
and O
lost O
not O
an O
instant O
in O
hastily O
preparing O
to O
obey O
the O
melancholy O
summons O
, O
by O
|
     | O
throwing O
on O
her O
coat O
and O
bonnet O
, O
while O
she O
rushed O
into O
the O
arms O
of O
Marion B-ORG
, O
and O
burst O
into O
an O

     | O
agony O
of O
tears O
in O
bidding O
her O
farewell O
. O

The O
French B-NORP
governess O
who O
had O
been O
summoned O
to O
escort O
Caroline B-GPE
in O
the O
carriage O
, O
was O
one O
of O

     | O
those O
nervous O
persons O
, O
who O
became O
perfectly O
frantic O
when O
hurried O
, O
and O
she O
flew O
about O
the O
room O
, O
|
     | O
uttering O
a O
volley O
of O
incoherent O
exclamations O
, O
expressive O
of O
her O
wonder O
and O
perplexity O
at O
so O
|
     | O
sudden O
a O
call O
on O
her O
activity O
, O
while O
her O
preparations O
seemed O
to O
make O
no O
visible O
progress O
. O
There O

     | O
is O
a O
secret O
, O
mysterious O
pleasure O
in O
being O
waited O
for O
, O
which O
every O
living O
mortal O
seems O
to O
enjoy O

     | O
when O
they O
have O
the O
opportunity O
  O
and O
without O
a O

Caroline B-GPE

her O
anxiety O
, O

     | O
and O
her O
sorrow O
, O
Madame O

expressed O
the O
most O
eager O

vehement O
solicitude O
about O
her O

a O
resolution O
not O

equipped O
to O
her O
entire O
satisfaction O
, O
for O
so O
rare O
and O

     | O
almost O
unprecedented O
an O
event O
, O
as O
leaving O

Every O

Madame O
D'Aubert B-PERSON

toilette O

     | O
being O
at O
last O
completed O
she O
leisurely O
advanced O
, O
talking O
to O
herself O

to O
everybody O
else O
, O

     | O
arranging O
her O
shawl O

giving O
a O
last O
finish O
to O
the O
contour O
of O
her O
bonnet O

before O
she O
threw O

     | O
herself O
with O
dignified O
deliberation O
into O
the O
chariot O
. O
| 
  | O
Marion B-ORG
had O
affectionately O
insisted O
on O
conveying O
her O
weeping O
friend O
to O
the O
carriage O
, O
while O
, O
|
     | O
with O
all O
the O
little O
arts O
of O
affection O
, O
she O
tried O
to O
console O
and O
encourage O
her O
, O
till O
at O
length O

     | O
they O
exchanged O
a O
final O
embrace O
, O

parted O

Scarcely O
, O
however O
, O
had O
Miss B-PERSON
Smythe I-PERSON
placed O
her O
foot O

     | O
upon O
the O
steps O
, O
while O
the O
man O
- O
servant O
who O
accompanied O
the O
carriage O
carefully O
assisted O
her O
in O
, O

     | O
before O
Marion B-ORG
suddenly O
sprung O
forward O
with O
an O
exclamation O
of O
terror O
, O
seized O
hold O
of O
Caroline B-GPE
's O
|
     | O
dress O
, O
and O
before O
she O
could O
speak O
, O
dragged O
her O
forcibly O
into O
the O
house O
, O
exclaiming O
in O
accents O
|
     | O
almost O
inarticulate O
from O
alarm O
, O
| 
  | O
" O

back O

dear O

     | O
Caroline O

come O
back O

the O
very O
dress O
of O
the O
person O
who O
attacked O
you O

the O

     | O
garden O

| 
  | O
Before O
Marion O
could O
finish O
her O
sentence O
, O
the O
supposed O
servant O
had O
violently O
seized O
Miss O

     | O
Smythe O
by O
the O
arms O
, O
and O
was O
about O
forcibly O
to O
drag O
her O
towards O
the O
carriage O
, O
when O
the O
loud O
|
     | O
cries O
of O
Marion B-ORG
brought O
assistance O
. O
The O
almost O
fainting O
girl O
was O
rescued O
, O
and O
the O
post O
- O
chaise O

     | O
secured O
  O

not O
a O
trace O
could O
be O
seen O
of O
the O
madman O
, O
who O
instantly O
vanished O
  O
and O
the O
post O
- O
boy O
|
     | O
could O
give O
no O
intelligence O
respecting O
him O
, O
except O
that O
he O
had O
been O
ordered O
out O
at O
an O
inn O
close O

     | O
by O
, O
in O
urgent O
haste O
, O
that O
evening B-TIME
, O
with O
a O
promise O
of O
double O
payment O
if O
he O
implicitly O
obeyed O
the O

     | O
gentleman O
, O
who O
seemed O
highly O
irritable O
, O
and O
swore O
at O
him O
in O
a O
most O
fearful O
manner O
, O
if O
he O
made O

     | O
the O
slightest O
delay O
, O
or O
so O
much O
as O
asked O
a O
direction O
which O
way O
to O
turn O

  | O
The O
most O
diligent O
search O
was O
made O
, O
but O
made O
in O
vain O
, O
by O
the O
officers O
of O
police O
, O
to O
find O
out O

     | O
the O
lunatic O

retreat O
, O
which O
eluded O
their O
utmost O
research O
  O
and O
as O
Caroline B-PERSON
Smythe I-PERSON
was O
privately O

removed O
soon O
afterwards O
from O

the O

whole O

seemed O
almost O
buried O

felt O
at O

? O
" O
was O
a O
frequent O
question O
of O
Agnes B-LOC
to O
herself O
, O
never O

     | O
apparently O
to O
obtain O
a O
satisfactory O
answer O
. O
On O
Caroline B-GPE
leaving O
school O
, O
her O
aunt O
had O
taken O
a O
|
     | O
villa O
at O
Portobello B-ORG
, O
where O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
English B-LANGUAGE
strangers O
excited O
extreme O
attention O
, O
more O
from O
their O
|
     | O
evident O
desire O
to O
avoid O
it O
, O
than O
from O
any O
thing O
very O
remarkable O
in O
their O
appearance O
or O
manner O
, O
|
     | O
though O
Mrs. O
Smythe B-PERSON
was O
certainly O
of O
that O
|  | O
genus O
|  | O
old O
maid O
so O
common O
in O
England B-GPE
, O
with O
a O
|
     | O
handsome O
independence O
, O
a O
suite O
of O
servants O
, O
a O
pony O
- O
carriage O
, O
most O
splendid O
dress O
, O
and O
some O
|
     | O
pretensions O
still O
to O
youth O
and O
beauty O
, O
as O
any O
fragment O
of O
good O
looks O
that O
yet O
remained O
she O
most O
|
     | O
liberally O
displayed O
  O
while O
her O
manner O
had O
a O
flirting O
tone O
of O
coquetry O
most O
unsuitable O
to O
her O
|
     | O
apparent O
age O
, O
forming O
a O
singular O
contrast O
to O
the O
quaker O
- O
like O
simplicity O
of O
Caroline B-GPE
's O
|
     | O
dress O
. O
| 
  | O
There O
was O
a O
singular O
contrast O
between O
the O
gravity O
of O
costume O
affected O
by O
Miss B-PERSON
Smythe I-PERSON
, O
and O
the O
|
     | O
keen O
festivity O
of O
spirit O
with O
which O
she O
entered O
into O
every O
scheme O
of O
amusement O
, O
or O
even O
, O
it O
|
     | O
might O
be O
said O
, O
of O
mischief O
. O
Her O
vivacity O
was O
occasionally O
almost O
overpowering O
, O
her O
fancy O
lively O
|
     | O
beyond O
example O
, O
while O
with O
her O
brilliant O
, O
yet O
interesting O
animation O
, O
there O
was O
mingled O
a O
rare O
|
     | O
acuteness O
of O
mind O
, O
a O
swift O
comprehension O
, O
and O
an O
innate O
passion O
for O
all O
that O
was O
amiable O
and O
|
     | O
beautiful O
, O
which O
gave O
liveliness O
and O
vigor O
to O
what O
she O
said O
, O
though O
the O
rapidity O
of O
her O
mind O
|
     | O
sometimes O
led O
Caroline B-GPE
to O
a O
false O
estimate O
of O
persons O
and O
circumstances O
, O
as O
she O
always O
judged O
|
     | O
or O
acted O
from O
instantaneous O
impulse O
  O
yet O
there O
was O
a O
generous O
frankness O
in O
her O
disposition O
, O
|
     | O
which O
captivated O
those O
who O
knew O
her O
, O
and O
a O
graceful O
simplicity O
in O
all O
she O
did O
, O
which O
gave O
it O
|
     | O
interest O
  O
for O
, O
without O
intention O
, O
there O
was O
something O
in O
all O
her O
thoughts O
and O
actions O
striking O
|
     | O
and O
peculiar O
. O
| 
  | O
Her O
features O
, O
though O
irregular O
, O
attracted O
and O
enchained O
the O
eye O
, O
from O
the O
magical O
variety O
of O
|
     | O
their O
expression O
, O
and O
though O
an O
amateur O
of O
mere O
beauty O
might O
have O
been O
surprised O
and O
perplexed O
|
     | O
to O
divine O
why O
her O
light O
grey O
eyes O
, O
pale O
cheeks O
, O
and O
chestnut O
hair O
could O
beguile O
his O
attention O
|
     | O
away O
from O
the O
more O
perfect O
contour O
of O
others O
, O
the O
amateur O
of O
physiognomy O
was O
delighted O
to O
find O
|
     | O
there O
an O
ever O
- O
varying O
source O
of O
interest O
in O
watching O
the O
bright O
emanations O
of O
thought O
, O
feeling O
, O
|
     | O
and O
vivacity O
, O
which O
glittered O
or O
sparkled O
in O
her O
eye O
, O
or O
played O
about O
her O
mouth O
. O

  | O
When O
Mrs. O
Smythe B-PERSON
first B-ORDINAL
settled O
at O
Portobello B-ORG
, O
scarcely O
a O
week O
of O
gossiping O
, O
wonder O
, O
and O

     | O
conjecture O
had O
elapsed O
, O
in O
the O
little O
community O
around O
, O
when O
she O
requested O
to O
have O
an O
interview O

     | O
with O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
alone O
, O
which O
took O
place O
immediately O
, O
and O
must O
have O
excited O
much O
interest O
in O
his O
|
     | O
mind O
, O
as O
the O
Admiral B-ORG
remained O
silent O
and O
abstracted O
during O
the O
whole O
subsequent O
evening B-TIME
, O
while O

     | O

strolled O
slowly O
up O

the O

with O
Mrs. O

his O
confidential O

house O

, O
with O
whom O
they O

     | O
requested O
a O
private O
conference O

the O

did O
not O
transpire O

From O
that B-DATE

, O
an O
intimacy O
, O
amounting O
to O
friendship O

was O
established O
between O
Sir O

     | O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
ladies O

on O

look O

advice O

Henry B-PERSON

how O

the O
transition O
from O
boyhood O

mature O

     | O
years O
! O
Henry B-PERSON
had O
early O
attained O
an O
extraordinary O
development O
of O
mind O
and O
appearance O
, O
a O
strength O

     | O
of O
intellect O
and O
a O
decision O
of O
purpose O
which O
seemed O
to O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
almost O
precocious O
, O
while O

     | O
every B-DATE

discovered O
some O

" O
thought O
the O
Admiral B-ORG
, O
when O
viewing O
the O
character O
of O
his O
young O
protege O
, O
as O
it O
|
     | O
gradually O
arose O
to O
personal O
and O
intellectual O
supremacy O
. O
His O
mind O
was O
ardent O

courageous O
, O
and O

     | O
deeply O
contemplative O
, O
full O
of O

apt O

all O
that O

to O
himself O

     | O
through O
an O
exaggerated O

His O

history O
, O
and O
the O
fascination O
of O
his O
manner O

     | O

cast O
a O
spell O
over O
the O

of O
all O
who O
beheld O
his O
countenance O

     | O
heard O
the O
sound O
of O
his O
harmonious O
voice O

With O
a O
strikingly O
handsome O
person O
, O
he O
had O
already O

     | O
acquired O
a O
decided O
air O
of O
fashion O

refinement O
, O
while O
a O
bright O
vein O
of O
almost O
chivalrous O

     | O
romance O
which O
enlivened O
his O

his O

to O
Sir O

without O

bounds O

his O
brotherly O
affection O

tinged O

the O
natural O

Every O

Henry B-ORG

upbraid O
himself O

vain O

unable O

the O
delight O

her O
delicious O
laugh O

the O

often O

a O
look O

the O

     | O
the O
color O
of O
Caroline B-GPE
in O
vivid O
flashes O
to O
her O
cheek O

caused O
an O
appearance O
of O
mutual O

     | O
embarrassment O
between O
the O
aunt O

Their O
extraordinary O

     | O
munificence O
to O
the O
poor O

also O
astonished O
him O

that O

to O
their O

only O

Sir O

himself O
, O
that O
Henry B-PERSON

     | O
sometimes O
feared O

encouraged O
his O

a O
degree O

     | O
inconsistent O
with O
the O
ordinary O

given O
with O

any O

Marion B-ORG

Sir O

was O
most O
unwillingly O

     | O
deposited O
in O
a O
carriage O
with O
her O
baggage O
, O
at O
the O
moment O

Captain O

full O

The O
Admiral B-ORG

himself O

natural O

her O

With O

flirting O

the O

she O
assumed O
a O

     | O
charming O
look O

receiving O
the O

of O
his O

     | O
small O
talk O

civilities O
with O
the O
most O
interesting O
expression O
of O

once O
Henry B-PERSON

in O
her O

so O
odd O
a O
mixture O

mirth O

at O

a O

in O

quivered O
on O

not O

wonder O

demure O

affected O

Nothing O

more O

now O

she O
nodded O

smiled O
with O
the O

of O
incredulity O

he O
had O

very O

I O
never O

observed O

could O
scarcely O

more O
striking O
! O
Do O
pray O
Captain O

De O
Crespigny O

turn O
your O
profile O
more O
towards O
Mrs. O

that O

may O
see O
what O
I O

" O

  | O
Henry B-PERSON
laughingly O
received O
these O

an O
undoubted O

bowed O
with O

     | O
good O

humored O
grace O
to O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON

astonishment O

color O
rushed O
to O
his O
very O

receded O
again O
, O
leaving O
his O
countenance O
pale O

almost O

     | O
ghastly O
, O
while O
he O
suddenly O
broke O
off O
the O

strode O
up O
to O
the O
fire O

place O
, O

     | O
for O
some B-TIME

he O
stood O

with O
his O
back O
to O
the O
company O

in O
evident O
agitation O

a O
dead O

     | O
silence O
ensued O

" O

Sir O

certainly O
Louis B-PERSON

the O
most O
conceited O

so O
intolerably O

was O
no O
such O

De B-PERSON

seems O
to O
think O

I O
paid O
him O
the O

laughing O

no O

of O
perplexity O

     | O
the O

Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
was O
bowing O
himself O
off O
late B-TIME
in I-TIME
the I-TIME
evening I-TIME
, O
and O
taking O
a O
very O
particular O
|
     | O
leave O
of O
Miss B-PERSON
Smythe I-PERSON
, O
having O
called O
up O
all O
his O
most O
fascinating O
graces O
for O
the O
occasion O
, O
while O
|
     | O
he O
felt O
inwardly O
gratified O
by O
the O
pleasing O
conviction O
that O
another O
had O
been O
added O
to O
the O
list O
|
     | O
of O
young O
ladies O
whom O
he O
had O
made O
miserable O
for O
life O
, O
when O
he O
was O
surprised O
to O
observe O
her O
mouth O
|
     | O
perfectly O
quivering O
with O
suppressed O
laughter O
, O
and O
an O
arch O
, O
satirical O
gleam O
in O
her O
eye O
for O
which O
|
     | O
he O
could O
not O
account O
, O
though O
it O
made O
him O
feel O
somewhat O
uncomfortable O
and O
dissatisfied O
. O
If O
it O
|
     | O
were O
possible O
that O
any O
one O
could O
be O
laughing O
at O
him O
, O
she O
certainly O
was O
! O
A O
world O
of O
most O
|
     | O
intolerable O
ridicule O
appeared O
in O
her O
expression O
— O
an O
air O
almost O
of O
contempt O
! O
and O
he O
turned O
to O
|
     | O
leave O
the O
room O
with O
a O
feeling O
of O
mortification O
and O
anger O
which O
he O
was O
ashamed O
to O
allow O
even O
to O
|
     | O
himself O
. O

When O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
hurriedly O
opened O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
door O
, O
near O
which O
he O
and O
Caroline B-PERSON

     | O
had O
been O
standing O
, O
he O
was O
surprised O
to O
see O
a O
person O
lurking O
close O
behind O
it O
, O
who O
darted O
|
     | O
instantly O
away O
, O
and O
disappeared O
  O
but O
before O
the O
intruder O
was O
out O
of O
sight O
, O
an O
exclamation O
of O
|
     | O
terror O
and O
dismay O
escaped O
from O
the O
lips O
of O
Caroline B-GPE
, O
who O
rushed O
towards O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
, O
exclaiming O
, O
|
     | O
in O
accents O
of O
almost O
frantic O
alarm O
, O
" O

there O

man O

him O
! O
stop O
him O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
instinctively O
ran O
in O
pursuit O
of O
the O
retreating O
figure O
, O
and O
eagerly O
|
     | O
attempted O
to O
seize O
him O
  O
but O
the O
fugitive O
instantaneously O
opened O
the O
house O
door O
, O
and O
escaped O
in O
|
     | O
the O
darkness O
, O
while O
, O
apparently O
to O
intimidate O
his O
pursuer O
, O
he O
fired O
a O
pistol O
in O
the O
air O
, O
and O
|
     | O
waved O
another O
above O
his O
head O
with O
frantic O
gestures O
of O
rage O
and O
violence O
. O

" O
It O
is O
beyond O
all O
measure O
extraordinary O
how O
he O
got O
into O
the O
house O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
, O
in O
|
     | O
discussing O
the O
event O
with O
an O
aspect O
of O
grave O
perplexity O
. O
" O
My O
doors O
are O
most O
systematically O

     | O
locked O
after O
dusk B-TIME
, O
and O
not O
a O
window O
is O
unbarred O

the O
locks O
are O
unbroken O

the O
bars O

     | O
untouched O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
There O
is O
something O
next O
to O
supernatural O
in O
the O
way O
he O
invariably O
finds O
us O
out O
, O
and O
gets O
|
     | O
access O
everywhere O
, O
" O
said O
Mrs. O
Smythe B-PERSON
, O
in O
almost O
breathless O
agitation O
. O
" O
One O
would O
imagine O
he O
had O
|
     | O
some O
unearthly O
accomplice O
to O
discover O
where O
we O
are O
concealed O
, O
and O
to O
assist O
him O
in O
escaping O
the O
|
     | O
vigilance O
of O
the O
police O
. O
Night O
and O
day O
we O
have O
been O
liable O
to O
his O
incursions O
. O
In O
town O
or O

     | O
country O
— O
in O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
, O
or O
beside O
our O
carriage O
— O
in O
church O
, O
or O
going O
to O
a O
party O
— O
there O
he O
is O
, O
|
     | O
lurking O
secretly O
near O
us B-GPE
, O
or O
terrifying O
Caroline B-PERSON
by O
his O
sudden O
disappearance O
, O
and O
gliding O
away O
|
     | O
like O
a O
shadow O
. O
He O
baffles O
every O
attempt O
to O
overtake O
or O
arrest O
him O
, O
but O
seems O
for O
ever O
on O
the O
|
     | O
watch O
! O
Sometimes O
he O
used O
to O
make O
his O
presence O
known O
by O
throwing O
a O
stone O
at O
our O
windows O
  O
often O
|
     | O
at O
midnight B-TIME
, O
by O
singing O
hoarsely O
beneath O
them O
, O
and O
even O
occasionally O
by O
firing O
a O
pistol O
in O
the O
|
     | O
air O
  O
but O
I O
did O
hope O
in O
this O
remote O
corner O
we O
might O
have O
enjoyed O
peace O
and O
safety O

How O
are O
we O

     | O
ever O
to O
venture O
home O
? O
" O

" O
I O
shall O
escort O
you O
with O
the O
whole O
party O
in O
close O
phalanx O

replied O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
, O
trying O
to O
|
     | O
assume O
a O
rallying O
tone O
. O
" O
Old O
Martin B-PERSON

quite O
invulnerable O

I O
only O

a O
month B-DATE

for O
the O

The O
night O
being O
impenetrably O
dark O
, O
and O
not O
a O
sound O
to O
be O
heard O
but O
the O
echo O
of O
their O
|
     | O
footsteps O
on O
the O
gravel O
, O
when O
Mrs. O
Smythe B-PERSON
alighted O
from O
the O
carriage O
to O
walk O
across O
the O
garden O
|
     | O
leading O
towards O
her O
house O
. O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
immediately O
desired O
the O
servants O
to O
bring O
out O
lights O
, O
|
     | O
when O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
candles O
having O
flared O
up O
suddenly O
near O
Caroline B-GPE
, O
she O
thought O
she O
perceived O
the O
|
     | O
madman O
close O
beside O
her O
, O
lurking O
behind O
the O
stem O
of O
a O
large O
tree O
. O
The O
dark O
shadows O
concealed O
|
     | O
all O
but O
his O
face O
, O
in O
which O
there O
gleamed O
a O
look O
of O
maniacal O
triumph O
and O
malignity O
, O
while O
|
     | O
rushing O
close O
up O
to O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
, O
he O
said O
, O
in O
a O
threatening O
tone O
, O
low O
and O
distinct O
, O
" O
He O

     | O
who O
crosses O
my O
path O
shall O
die O
! O
" O
and O
instantly O
disappeared O
through O
the O
hedge O
. O
When O
Miss B-PERSON
Smythe I-PERSON
, O

     | O
on O
hearing O
his O
voice O
, O
with O
a O
stifled O
scream O
of O
terror O
fled O
into O
the O
house O

again O
that O
loud O
and O
|
     | O
fiendish O
laugh O
, O
which O
she O
had O
already O
heard O
once O
, O
arose O
behind O
her O
, O
and O
rung O
through O
the B-TIME
night I-TIME
|
     | O
air O
in O
tones O
of O
high O
delirium O
, O
causing O
a O
cold O
shudder O

thrill O
through O
the O
hearts O
of O
even O
the O

     | O
boldest O
among O
her O
companions O
, O
while O
they O
hastily O
followed O
her O
, O

having O
placed O
the O
trembling O

     | O
girl O
in O
apparent O
safety O

soon O

sufficiently O
compose O
her O
mind O

retire O

after O

     | O
the O
house O
was O
sufficiently O
quiet O
, O
and O
the O
servants O
in O
bed O
, O
she O
sat O
up O
reading O

with O
the O
hope O

     | O
that O
her O
nerves O
might O
become O
less O
painfully O
agitated O
. O
The O
slightest O
noise O
caused O
her O
heart O
to O

     | O
beat O
almost O
audibly O
, O

she O
was O
conscious O
that O

mouse O
rattling O
in O
the O
wainscot O

upon O

only O
divided O
by O

thin O
partition O

Caroline B-PERSON
induced O

     | O
her O
, O
at O
a B-TIME
late I-TIME
hour I-TIME
, O
to O
withdraw O
, O
while O
not O
a O
sound O
now O
disturbed O
the O
deep O
repose O
of O
nature O
, O

" O
the O
wailing O
sorrows O

midnight O
bird O

The O
moon O
had O
arisen O

shining O
with O
softened O
radiance O
into O
her O
apartment O

when O
Miss B-PERSON
Smythe I-PERSON

     | O
arose O
from O
her O
devotions O

and O
she O
could O
not O

think O
at O
the O
moment O
what O
a O
bright O
emblem O
of O
her O

     | O
divine O
Saviour O
that O
glorious O
luminary O
presented O
to O
the O
mind O
, O
not O
glowing O
, O
like O
the O
sun O

with O
a O

     | O
radiance O

no O
human O
eye O
can O
gaze O
upon O

darkened O
earth O
a O
mild O
, O

subdued O
refulgence O
, O
perfectly O
suited O
for O
the O
steady O
contemplation O
of O
those O
whom O
it O

arisen O

to O
benefit O

cheer O

night O

Pleased O
with O
such O
thoughts O

a O
gradual O
composure O
stole O
over O
her O
senses O

Caroline B-GPE
, O
at O

     | O
length O
, O
seeing O
her O
candle O
nearly O
burned O
out O

determined O
to O
retire O

night O

sound O
was O
to O

house O

her O
own O
light O
step O
, O
as O
she O
moved O
about O
the O

     | O
room,—the O
very O
opening O
of O
a O
drawer O
, O
or O
the O
shutting O
of O
her O
book O

sounded O
unnaturally O
loud O
, O

     | O
jarring O
upon O
her O
nerves O
with O
a O
startling O
effect,—the O
shadows O
in O
the O
more O
distant O
part O
of O
the O

     | O
room O
looked O
darker O
than O
usual O
, O
and O
the O
least O
moan O
of O
the O
wind O
increased O
the O
painful O
tension O
of O

     | O
her O
nerves O
to O
agony O
. O
Scarcely O
had O
she O
begun O
to O
undress O
, O
when O
a O
sudden O
noise O
not O
far O
off O
caused O

     | O
her O
to O
start O
with O
convulsive O
terror O

heart O

apprehension O

persuade O
herself O
that O
the O
sound O
must O
have O
been O
produced O
by O
her O
own O
|
     | O
fancy,—she O
looked O
around O
, O
and O
all O
was O
quiet,—she O
listened O
, O
and O
all O
was O
perfectly O
still,—she O
|
     | O
reasoned O
with O
herself O
, O
and O
became O
resolute O
to O
try O
whether O
sleep O
might O
not O
plunge O
her O
into O
|
     | O
forgetfulness O
and O
peace O
, O
when O
her O
attention O
was O
accidentally O
attracted O
towards O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
|
     | O
windows O
, O
where O
the O
bright O
moonbeams O
rested O
on O
an O
object O
which O
seemed O
to O
blast O
her O
eyes O
with O
|
     | O
horror O
, O
and O
paralyzed O
her O
at O
once O
in O
a O
speechless O
agony O
of O
fear O
. O
The O
top O
of O
a O
ladder O
rested O
on O
|
     | O
the O
window O
- O
sill O
, O
upon O
the O
summit O
of O
which O
stood O
the O
dark O
figure O
of O
a O
man O
, O
his O
face O
plastered O
so O
|
     | O
close O
upon O
the O
glass O
, O
that O
his O
nose O
was O
perfectly O
flattened O
against O
it O
, O
and O
his O
hands O
raised O
in O
|
     | O
a O
menacing O
attitude O
towards O
her O
. O
The O
instant O
he O
saw O
, O
by O
Caroline B-PERSON
's O
look O
of O
frantic O
alarm O
, O
that O
|
     | O
she O
had O
seen O
him O
, O
he O
dashed O
in O
the O
window O
- O
frame O
by O
a O
single O
stroke O
of O
his O
powerful O
arm O
, O
and O
|
     | O
seemed O
about O
to O
make O
a O
forcible O
entrance O
, O
when O
Miss B-PERSON
Smythe I-PERSON
, O
with O
the O
energy O
of O
despair O
, O
threw O
|
     | O
open O
the O
door O
, O
and O
fled O
, O
calling O
aloud O
, O
in O
the O
sharp O
, O
shrill O
accents O
of O
desperation O
, O
for O
|
     | O
help O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
servants O
were O
speedily O
assembled O
around O
her O
, O
and O
the O
instant O
she O
felt O
herself O
in O
|
     | O
comparative O
safety O
, O
nature O
could O
sustain O
no O
more O
, O
but O
, O
convulsed O
in O
every O
nerve O
, O
and O
throwing O
|
     | O
herself O
into O
the O
arms O
of O
Mrs. O
Smythe B-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
cry O
of O
thankfulness O
and O
agitation O
, O
she O
|
     | O
fainted O
. O
| 
  | O
An O
instant O
alarm O
was O
given O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
, O
a O
diligent O
search O
was O
made O
, O
and O
the O
police O
|
     | O
for O
several B-DATE
days I-DATE
exerted O
their O
utmost O
activity O
to O
detect O
the O
miscreant O
, O
but O
in O
vain O
. O
Not O
a O
|
     | O
trace O
remained O
to O
convince O
Caroline B-GPE
that O
the O
whole O
had O
not O
been O
a O
hideous O
dream O
, O
except O
that O
|
     | O
the O
ladder O
had O
been O
left O
standing O
at O
her O
window O
, O
and O
turned O
out O
to O
have O
been O
stolen O
from O
a O
|
     | O
neighboring O
garden O
. O
The O
window O
- O
frame O
exhibited O
a O
frightful O
picture O
of O
devastation O
, O
being O
|
     | O
literally O
broken O
to O
fragments O
, O
and O
at O
some O
distance O
in O
the O
garden O
a O
loaded O
pistol O
was O
|
     | O
discovered O
, O
perfectly O
new O
, O
which O
it O
was O
hoped O
might O
lead O
to O
a O
discovery O
, O
by O
the O
police O
tracing O
|
     | O
out O
the O
maker O
and O
purchaser O

seeing O
that O
it O
had O

CHAPTER O
VIII O
. O
| 
  | O
Several O
meetings O
now O
took O
place O
at O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
's O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
considering O
what O
plans O
|
     | O
would O
be O
best O
adapted O
to O
secure O
the O
safety O
of O
Mrs. O
and O
Miss B-PERSON
Smythe I-PERSON
, O
till O
the O
dangerous O
madman O
|
     | O
who O
persecuted O
them O
could O
be O
secured O
and O
confined O
, O
on O
all O
which O
occasions O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
|
     | O
attended O
, O
as O
he O
rather O
enjoyed O
the O
excitement O
and O
interest O
with O
which O
the O
story O
filled O
up O
his O
|
     | O
vacant O
hours O
, O
and O
, O
careless O
of O
the O
impression O
he O
believed O
himself O
to O
be O
making O
on O
the O
|
     | O
affections O
of O
Miss B-PERSON
Smythe I-PERSON
, O
he O
felt O
some O
solicitude O
respecting O
her O
safety O
, O
while O
he O
expressed O
|
     | O
ten B-CARDINAL
times O
more O
than O
he O
felt O
, O
and O
observed O
, O
in O
his O
usual O
off O
- O
handed O
style O
, O
that O
this O
was O
not O
the O
|
     | O
only O
man O
whose O
head O
she O
would O
probably O
turn O
  O
but O
in O
his O
own O
case O
, O
though O
she O
had O
almost O
put O
him O
|
     | O
out O
of O
his O
senses O
already O
, O
yet O
he O
would O
rather O
make O
an O
end O
of O
himself O
than O
of O
her O
. O
| 
  | O
Caroline B-PERSON
drily O
thanked O
him O
for O
his O
obliging O
intentions O
on O
her O
behalf O
, O
and O
after O
a O
lively O
|
     | O
dialogue O
, O
in O
which O
the O
gay O
huzzar O
actually O
excelled O
himself O
, O
in O
his O
fervent O
expressions O
of O
|
     | O
admiration O
and O
regard O
, O
he O
took O
leave O
, O
rather O
wondering O
to O
think O
how O
he O
had O
been O
led O
on O
in O
|
     | O
professing O
so O
much O
, O
and O
giving O
himself O
a O
lecture O
as O
he O
rode O
home O
, O
on O
the O
propriety O
of O
beginning O
|
     | O
to O
" O
back O
out O
, O
" O
seeing O
that O
he O
was O
getting O
rather O
beyond O
his O
depth O
. O
Still O
there O
were O
several O
of O
|
     | O
the O
reasons O
for O
meeting O
next B-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
usual O
with O
those O
who O
have O
a O
natural O
desire O
to O
improve O
an O
|
     | O
agreeable O
intimacy O
, O
a O
song O
to O
be O
practised O
, O
a O
drawing O
to O
be O
admired O
  O
and O
Miss B-PERSON
Smythe I-PERSON
having O
|
     | O
made O
a O
sort O
of O
promise O
to O
let O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
sit O
to O
her O
for O
his O
picture O
in O
the O
character O
|
     | O
of O
Dromio B-PERSON
, O
as O
she O
was O
an O
admirable O
artist O
, O
the O
offer O
became O
irresistible O
. O
He O
had O
never O
yet O
|
     | O
entered O
their O
own O
house O
, O
as O
meetings O
were O
always O
hitherto O
arranged O
at O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
's O
  O
and O
a O
|
     | O
slight O
feeling O
of O
curiosity O
likewise O
helped O
him O
to O
the O
agreeable O
conclusion O
, O
that O
he O
must O
for O
|
     | O
once O
, O
and O
only O
once O
, O
call O
on O
the O
" O
Smythes O
, O
" O
were O
it O
only O
to O
ascertain O
what O
sort O
of O
|
     | O
establishment O
they O
had O
. O
| 
  | O
Punctual O
to O
the O
appointed O
hour O
, O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
groom O
rang O
a O
consequential O
peal O
for O
|
     | O
his O
master O
at O
the O
gate O
of O
Rosemount B-PERSON
Villa I-PERSON
, O
such O
as O
had O
not O
been O
heard O
there O
since O
bells O
were O
|
     | O
invented O
, O
and O
after O
a O
considerable O
delay O
, O
the O
door O
was O
opened O
by O
a O
shabby O
awkward O
- O
looking O
Irish B-NORP
|
     | O
girl O
, O
speaking O
with O
a O
powerful O
brogue O
, O
who O
curtsied O
with O
an O
appearance O
of O
most O
preposterous O
|
     | O
respect O
to O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
as O
he O
alighted O
, O
and O
pointed O
up O
stairs O
, O
begging O
him O
to O
walk O
in O
, O
|
     | O
but O
without O
having O
an O
idea O
apparently O
that O
she O
ought O
herself O
to O
usher O
him O
into O
the O
|
     | O
drawing O
- O
room O
. O
| 
  | O
Being O
always O
pretty O
confident O
of O
making O
himself O
welcome O
, O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
advanced O
, O
and O
|
     | O
in O
his O
usual O
gay O
, O
humorous O
tone O
, O
announced O
his O
own O
name O
at O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
door O
, O
while O
he O
|
     | O
threw O
it O
open O
and O
entered O
. O
To O
his O
surprise O
, O
he O
now O
found O
himself O
in O
a O
small O
, O
not O
very O
|
     | O
splendidly O
furnished O
apartment O
, O
stretched O
on O
the O
only O
sofa O
belonging O
to O
which O
, O
there O
lounged O
, O
|
     | O
in O
solitary O
indolence O
, O
with O
a O
quite O
- O
at O
- O
home O
look O
, O
a O
young O
man O
whom O
he O
had O
never O
seen O
before O
. O
|
     | O
His O
aspect O
and O
dress O
were O
equally O
singular O
, O
presenting O
that O
happy O
mixture O
of O
the O
ruffian B-NORP
and O
|
     | O
gentleman O
, O
not O
very O
uncommon O
in O

Attired O
in O
a O

great O

he O
wore O
a O
most O

     | O
preposterous O
pair O
of O
whiskers O
and O
mustachios O
, O
long O
, O
coarse O
, O
and O
dirty O

which O
looked O
as O
if O
they O

     | O
had O
been O
curled O
over O
knitting O

Taking O

out O

the O

the O

my O

slightly O

Captain O

in O
a O
tone O
of O
angry O

I O

heard O
that O

enough O

when O
my O

told O
me O
this B-TIME

how O
soon O
you O

nothing O

to O

laughed O

No O

with O
rising O
irritation O

Captain O

, O
turning O
round O
his O

continued O
the O
Irishman B-NORP

with O
a O
still O
stronger O

A O
momentary O
pause O
ensued O
, O
during O
which O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
frowned O
and O
bit O
his O
lip O
, O
in O
angry O

     | O
embarrassment O

while O
, O
with O
a O
look O
of O
unutterable O
contempt O

eyed O
his O

thrust O
his O

him O

for O
some O
moments O
with O
a O
look O
of O
stern O
reproach O

in O
a O
stronger O
Irish B-NORP

ever O

     | O

with O
a O
torrent O
of O
indignation O
, O
which O
gave O
almost O
the O
dignity O
of O
eloquence O
to O
what O
he O

     | O
uttered O
, O

Not O
having O

     | O
lately O

managed O
there O

at O

     | O
this O

a O
thousand O
recollections O
crowded O
upon O
him O

of O
warnings O

had O
received O
from O
his O

be O
exercised O
beside O
the O
Shannon B-FAC

though O
most O
of O
what O
they O
said O

had O
been O
listened O
to O
with O
the O

incredulous O
attention O
usually O

     | O
bestowed O
upon O
stories O
of O
ghosts O

Here O
he O
was O

snared O
like O

in O

though O
without O

with O
no O

in O
that O
attitude O
peculiar O
to O
Englishmen B-PRODUCT

calmly O

sternly O
looked O
in O
the O
face O
of O
his O

     | O
insolent O

whose O
lip O
became O
compressed O

an O
air O
of O
fierce O
determination O
, O
while O
his O

     | O
dark O
eye O
glittered O
with O
a O
triumphant O
smile O

in O
an O
attitude O

leisurely O
resuming O

on O
the O

Neither O

recommence O
the O
discussion O
immediately O

     | O
and O
both O
looked O
equally O
angry O

till O
the O
Irishman B-NORP
at O
length O
opened O
a O
pocket O

book O

almost O

his O
breath O

almost O
a O

a O
long O
vista O
of O

     | O
annoyance O
from O

He O
was O
aware O

laugh O

the O

that O

feel O
themselves O
aggrieved O

     | O
it O

seeing O

with O
an O
air O

attentively O

     | O
glanced O
his O
eye O
over O

finding O
that O
it O
contained O
only O
a O
short O

simple O

     | O
declaration O
that O

across O

with O

     | O
infinite O
dignity O

strode O
out O

was O
his O
surprise O
, O
when O
descending O
the O
staircase O

to O
hear O

in O
the O
room O

so O

     | O
recently O
left O

smothered O
laughter O
from O
several O
persons O

He O
could O
not O
be O

     | O
mistaken O

seemed O
even O
as O
if O
there O
were O
female O
voices O
in O
the O
number O
  O

almost O
bewildered O

     | O
with O
anger O
, O
and O
happy O
also O
to O
escape O
, O
he O
hastened O
onwards O
, O
threw O
himself O
on O
horseback O
, O
and O

     | O
galloped O
for O
three B-TIME
hours I-TIME
before O
he O
had O
regained O
any O
portion O

usual O
equanimity O

followed O

first B-ORDINAL
impulse O

on O
hearing O
the O
laughter O
behind O
him O

it O

     | O
would O

enter O

his O

disencumbering O
himself O

Mrs. O

accents O

convulsive O

in O

tone O
so O
exactly O

resembling O

of O

into O
a O
simultaneous O
laugh O
of O
frolicsome O
glee O

     | O
continued O
the O
dialogue O

several B-TIME

with O
great O
spirit O

vivacity O

Henry B-PERSON

     | O
suddenly O
became O
conscious O

that O
in O
imagining O
the O
words O

was O
gradually O
betrayed O

into O
expressing O

that O

too O

with O
a O
depth O

himself O

the O
color O
rushed O

it O
red O
to O
the O
very O

     | O
roots O
of O
his O

instantly O
receded O
again O

the O

leaned O
his O
head O

contemplating O
that O

silent O

one B-CARDINAL

the O
pleasing O

perhaps O
presumptuous O
hope O

that O

been O
remembered O

CHAPTER B-LAW
IX I-LAW
. O
| 
  | O
Among O
the O
companions O
of O
Agnes B-LOC
and O
Marion B-GPE
Dunbar I-GPE
, O
none O
was O
more O
calculated O
to O
excite O
a O
feeling O
|
     | O
of O
enthusiastic O
tenderness O
and O
regard O
than O
Clara B-PERSON
Granville I-PERSON
, O
whom O
all O
approached O
with O
a O
feeling O
|
     | O
of O
nearly O
romantic O
interest O
, O
occasioned O
by O
the O
etherealized O
delicacy O
of O
her O
lovely O
countenance O
|
     | O
and O
fragile O
form O
. O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
, O
from O
her O
earliest O
childhood O
, O
had O
always O
mentioned O
Clara B-PERSON
in O
terms O
|
     | O
of O
such O
exaggerated O
enthusiasm O
, O
that O
Agnes B-LOC
, O
imagining O
his O
taste O
to O
be O
very O
different O
, O
believed O
|
     | O
him O
to O
be O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
half I-CARDINAL
in O
jest O
, O
though O
his O
language O
and O
manner O
seemed O
daily B-DATE
to O
become O
more O
in O
|
     | O
earnest O
, O
while O
in O
terms O
of O
rapture O
he O
admired O
her O
eloquent O
and O
intelligent O
conversation O
, O
so O
|
     | O
different O
from O
the O
flippant O
nonsense O
of O
most O
girls O
, O
and O
the O
light O
gracefulness O
of O
her O
step O
, O
|
     | O
saying O
she O
looked O
like O
some O
beautiful O
apparition O
, O
less O
encumbered O
with O
body O
, O
and O
more O
endowed O
|
     | O
with O
spirit O
, O
than O
any O
one O
who O
ever O
before O
stepped O
upon O
the O
earth B-LOC
. O
Her O
pale O
golden O
hair O
, O
falling O
|
     | O
like O
a O
halo O
round O
her O
fair O
bright O
countenance O
, O
and O
the O
rare O
beauty O
of O
her O
large O
downcast O
eyes O
, O
|
     | O
which O
were O
generally O
veiled O
with O
a O
look O
of O
deep O
thought O
and O
sensibility O
, O
gave O
a O
charm O
so O
|
     | O
peculiar O
to O
her O
aspect O
, O
that O
the O
eye O
loved O
to O
dwell O
upon O
it O
as O
upon O
some O
lovely O
twilight O
scene O
, O
|
     | O
over O
which O
the O
light O
of O
heaven O
was O
casting O
its O
pure O
and O
peaceful O
, O
yet O
fading O
refulgence O
. O
None O
|
     | O
looked O
at O
Clara B-GPE
without O
fearing O
that O
she O
could O
not O
be O
long O
intended O
for O
this O
world O
, O
as O
the O
|
     | O
fervor O
of O
her O
mind O
and O
feelings O
appeared O
so O
little O
in O
proportion O
to O
the O
extreme O
delicacy O
of O
her O
|
     | O
complexion O
, O
which O
was O
tinted O
like O
a O
rose O
- O
leaf O
on O
her O
transparent O
cheek O
, O
the O
color O
flitting O
with O
|
     | O
every O
passing O
emotion O
. O
It O
did O
indeed O
seem O
as O
if O
the O
sword O
within O
must O
quickly O
wear O
out O
the O
|
     | O
scabbard O
  O
yet O
Clara B-PERSON
enjoyed O
society O
beyond O
measure O
, O
and O
mingled O
in O
it O
with O
a O
zest O
which O
caused O
|
     | O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
often O
to O
say O
she O
must O
be O
stronger O
certainly O
than O
she O
looked O
, O
and O
there O
was O
nothing O
, O
|
     | O
he O
thought O
, O
more O
odious O
in O
a O
woman O
than O
rude O
health O
— O
a O
sort O
of O
rudeness O
never O
certainly O
|
     | O
attributable O
to O
Miss B-PERSON
Granville I-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
Agnes B-LOC
's O
favorite O
aversion O
had O
always O
been O
Clara B-PERSON
, O
formerly O
her O
cotemporary O
and O
rival O
at O
|
     | O
school O
, O
though O
the O
rivalship O
was O
only O
felt O
on O
one O
side O
, O
as O
Miss B-PERSON
Granville I-PERSON
would O
have O
remained O
|
     | O
unconscious O
of O
its O
very O
existence O
, O
but O
for O
the O
bitter O
taunts O
occasionally O
levelled O
at O
her O
, O
and O
|
     | O
the O
tone O
of O
evident O
irritability O
in O
which O
Agnes B-LOC
took O
it O
always O
for O
granted O
that O
the O
jealousy O
|
     | O
was O
mutual O
, O
attributing O
thoughts O
and O
motives O
perpetually O
to O
her O
gentle O
companion O
, O
of O
which O
so O
|
     | O
amiable O
and O
well O
- O
regulated O
a O
disposition O
was O
incapable O
. O
It O
may O
generally O
be O
observed O
, O
that O
many O
|
     | O
more O
quarrels O
arise O
from O
people O
wilfully O
taking O
offence O
, O
than O
from O
people O
wilfully O
giving O
it O
  O
|
     | O
and O
there O
is O
quite O
as O
much O
ill O
- O
temper O
in O
the O
one B-CARDINAL
case O
as O
in O
the O
other O
. O
Clara B-PERSON
had O
suffered O
much O
|
     | O
on O
account O
of O
her O
every O
inadvertent O
word O
or O
action O
being O
purposely O
misconstrued O
  O
but O
she O
very O
|
     | O
properly O
viewed O
the O
annoyance O
as O
a O
salutary O
lesson O
in O
circumspection O
, O
before O
entering O
the O
great O
|
     | O
arena O
of O
society O
, O
and O
mildly O
avoided O
all O
collision O
of O
interests O
or O
opinions O
with O
Agnes B-LOC
, O
though O
|
     | O
her O
whole O
powers O
of O
conciliation O
on O
the O
part O
of O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
gave O
his O
sister O
reason O
to O
apprehend O
|
     | O
that O
his O
affections O
might O
by O
possibility O
be O
engaged O
to O
her O
. O
Nothing O
could O
be O
more O
painfully O
|
     | O
irritating O
than O
the O
tone O
of O
contempt O
with O
which O
Agnes B-LOC
" O
spoke O
at O
" O
Clara B-PERSON
respecting O
the O
art O
and O
|
     | O
cunning O
with O
which O
some O
manœuvring O
misses O
endeavored O
to O
push O
their O
fortune O
in O
the O
matrimonial O
|
     | O
world O
, O
by O
making O
advances O
to O
gentlemen O
, O
which O
she O
would O
despise O
herself O
for O
condescending O
to O
, O
|
     | O
and O
that O
lookers O
on O
see O
more O
of O
the O
game O
than O
is O
intended O
. O
All O
this O
was O
said O
in O
such O
an O
|
     | O
accidental O
tone O
, O
and O
in O
such O
general O
terms O
, O
that O
no O
decided O
notice O
could O
be O
taken O
of O
it O
by O
|
     | O
Clara B-PERSON
, O
who O
nevertheless O
felt O
so O
painful O
a O
consciousness O
of O
what O
was O
meant O
and O
insinuated O
, O
that O
|
     | O
she O
ceased O
almost O
entirely O
to O
visit O
Agnes B-LOC

or O
to O
associate O
with O
her O

returned O
from O

a O
month O

     | O
at O
Lady B-ORG
Towercliffe I-ORG

in O
Fife O
, O
evidently O
laboring O
under O
a O
depression O
of O
spirits O
very O
unusual O
|
     | O
with O
him O
  O
and O
when O
Agnes B-LOC

perplexed O
by O
observing O
that O

did O
not O
attempt O
to O
throw O
off O
the O
cloud O

     | O
of O
melancholy O
, O
tinged O
very O
strongly O
with O
ill O
- O
humor O
, O
which O
had O
so O
suddenly O
come O
over O
him O
, O
tried O
|
     | O
to O
guess O
or O
discover O
the O
cause O
, O
she O
found O
it O
for O
some O
time O
impossible O
to O
gain O
a O
glimpse O
of O
the O

     | O
truth O
, O

At O

after O

one O

Agnes B-LOC
inquired O
for O

Sir O

shortly O

drily O

     | O
replied O
, O

" O

You O
are O
beyond O
all O

absurd O

tormenting O

" O
continued O
Agnes B-LOC
, O
with O
a O
contemptuous O

     | O
toss O
of O
her O
head O
  O
" O

I O
may O
at O

venture O
with O
impunity O

angrily O

" O
Never O

a O

The O
very O
style O
of O
her O

is O
wearying O

with O
not O

asked O
Sir O

up O

" O

" O
Certainly O

Sir O

in O
a O
voice O

sounded O

that B-DATE

more O

the O
worth O

There O

the O
character O
of O
Clara B-PERSON

Her O
manner O

the O
very O
essence O

Every O

coarse O

up O

some O

was O
in O

the O

point O
in O

him O

appearance O

so O
young O

sentiment O

     | O
Lady O

her O

her O

that O
was O

     | O
superseded O
before O
long O

still O
greater O
admiration O

Richard B-PERSON

Captain O

from O
their O
being O
so O

     | O
generally O
discussed O

now O

unfortunately O

raised O
him O
above O

appear O
all O

During O
their O

, O
she O
saw O
nothing O
in O
his O

     | O
conversation O
to O
disapprove O
, O
because O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
most O
unintentionally O
deceived O
her O
into O
a O
belief O

     | O
of O
his O
being O
very O
different O
from O
what O
he O
really O
was O

owing O
to O
the O
respect O
with O
which O
he O
treated O

     | O
all O
her O
opinions O
  O
and O
only O
when O
he O
talked O
to O
others O
, O
did O
she O
become O
startled O
occasionally O
by O
|
     | O
the O
tone O
of O
careless O
defiance O
with O
which O
he O
spoke O
of O
all O
those O
persons O
and O
things O
which O
she O
was O

     | O
most O
accustomed O
to O
reverence O

esteem O

Before O
long O
, O
his O
attachment O

become O
so O
unbounded O
, O

     | O
that O
, O
conscious O
he O
could O
not O
obtain O
Clara B-PERSON

hand O
if O
she O
knew O
his O
real O
character O

he O
assumed O
all O

that O
seemed O
most O
likely O
to O
secure O
her O
confidence O

, O
for O
the O
pleasure O
of O
being O
with O
her O
, O

     | O
attended O
church O
regularly O
on O
Sunday B-DATE
at O
the O

Clara B-PERSON
was O
astonished O
at O
his O
evident O

     | O
ignorance O
of O
the O
forms O

devotion O
  O

knowing O
his O
education O
had O
been O
finished O
by O
a O
clergyman O
, O

     | O
she O
supposed O

imbibed O
a O
due O
respect O

some O
time O

before O
his O

     | O
attention O
became O
so O
very O
obvious O
as O
to O
excite O
her O
peculiar O

to O
make O
her O
conscious O

a O
necessity O
for O
inquiring O
into O
the O

, O

she O
became O

instantly O
aware O

her O

with O
all O

assumed O

no O

with O
the O
happiness O
of O
another O

and O
least O
of O
all O
with O

     | O
yours O
, O
being O
a O
confirmed O

, O
still O
pursuing O
the O
very O
wildest O
career O
of O
unprincipled O

     | O

Many O
have O
already O
had O
reason O
to O
mourn O
they O
ever O
trusted O
him O
or O
knew O
him O
, O
for O
he O
is O
|
     | O
the O
very O
reverse O
of O
all O
you O
believe O
and O
wish O
. O
It O
would O
be O
extravagant O
to O
waste O
a O
hope O
upon O
the O
|
     | O
reformation O
of O
a O
reckless O
libertine O
, O
who O
thus O
outrages O
every O
law O
of O
God O
and O
man O
  O
and O
often O
have O

     | O
you O

I O
agreed O
, O
that O
it O
was O
a O
thing O
not O
to O
be O
conceived O
, O
a O
woman O
who O
rightly O
valued O
her O
|
     | O
immortal O
soul O
placing O
herself O
under O
the O
authority O
and O
influence O
of O
a O
husband O
who O
did O
not O
! O
The O
|
     | O
risk O
is O
too O
great O
  O
and O
how O
much O
better O
to O
suffer O
now O
the O
sorrow O
of O
a O
separation O
, O
than O
to O
endure O
|
     | O
the O
long O
agony O
of O
an O
unsuitable O
union O
, O
for O
which O
your O
own O
heart O
and O
conscience O
would O
|
     | O
continually O
upbraid O
you O
. O
If O
the O
tenderest O
affection O
of O
a O
brother O
can O
in O
any O
degree O
compensate O
|
     | O
for O
the O
sacrifice O
, O
you O
need O
not O
be O
told O
, O
my O
dear O
Clara B-PERSON
, O
that O
I O
shall O
bestow O
it O
upon O
you O
more O

     | O
lavishly O
than O
ever O
  O
and O
it O
will O
be O
my O
first B-ORDINAL
earthly O
wish O

as O
well O
as O
my O
sacred O
duty O
, O
to O
render O

     | O
you O
happier O
than O
you O
could O
ever O
be O
with O
a O
man O
of O
principles O
— O
, O
or O
rather O
of O
no O
principles,—like O

Sir O

" O

Had O
the O
grave O
opened O

feet O

she O
could O
scarcely O
have O
been O
more O
startled O
and O

     | O
astonished O
than O
by O
the O
contents O

this O
most O
unforeseen O
letter O

the O
first B-ORDINAL
unwelcome O
line O
ever O

     | O
received O
from O
Richard B-PERSON

She O
could O
have O
borne O
anything O
but O
to O
find O
her O
lover O
unprincipled O
or O
|
     | O
unworthy O
  O
and O
a O
wintry O
chill O
seemed O
to O
gather O
round O
her O
heart O
, O
while O
, O
with O
a O
stifled O
groan O

     | O
which O
struggled O
for O
utterance O
, O
she O
covered O
her O
face O
with O
her O
hand O
, O
and O
sank O
back O
upon O
a O
sofa O
. O
|
     | O
By O
a O
powerful O
effort O
, O
Clara B-GPE
preserved O
herself O
from O
fainting O
— O
she O
was O
resolved O
not O
to O
faint O
, O
and O
|
     | O
she O
did O
not O
— O
but O
in O
the O
secret O
chamber O
of O
her O
heart O
all O
was O
darkness O
, O
loneliness O
, O
and O
grief O

     | O
Visions O
of O
earthly O
happiness O
had O
glittered O
for O
a O
time O
, O
in O
brightest O
coloring O
, O
before O
her O
mind O
  O
|
     | O
but O
now O
they O
must O
be O
blotted O
out O
by O
her O
tears O
. O
They O
all O
lay O
prostrate O
and O
disfigured O
at O
her O
|
     | O
feet O
, O
scorched O
and O
blasted O
as O
if O
by O
lightning O
  O
and O
her O
heart O
, O
bewildered O
by O
a O
multitude O
of O

     | O
thoughts O
and O
emotions O
, O
seemed O
full O
almost O
to O
bursting O
. O
| 
  | O
Clara B-PERSON
wept O
many O
bitter O
tears O
over O
her O
letter O
, O
and O
she O
not O
only O
wept O
but O
acted O
. O
Without O
delay O
, O
|
     | O
Clara B-PERSON
prepared O
to O
return O
to O
the O
relation O
with O
whom O
, O
during O
her O
brother O
's O
absence O
, O
she O
usually O
|
     | O
found O
a O
home O
  O
and O
before O
her O
departure O
, O
not O
only O
wrote O
to O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
, O
stating O
in O
terms O
of O
|
     | O
touching O
grief O
, O
all O
her O
reasons O
for O
so O
suddenly O
and O
unwillingly O
withdrawing O
from O
her O
engagement O
|
     | O
to O
him O
  O
but O
she O
had O
a O
long O
and O
most O
afflicting O
interview O
with O
him O
, O
vainly O
endeavoring O
to O
|
     | O
convince O
her O
lover O
, O
that O
their O
total O
incompatibility O
of O
sentiment O
raised O
a O
barrier O
between O
|
     | O
them O
, O
which O
forbade O
the O
possibility O
of O
their O
union O
. O
| 
  | O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
became O
nearly O
frantic O
with O
vexation O
, O
while O
he O
could O
not O
but O
admire O
the O
beautiful O
|
     | O
grace O
of O
her O
manner O
, O
and O
the O
sorrowful O
modulations O
of O
her O
voice O
when O
she O
spoke O
, O
yet O
unconscious O
|
     | O
how O
completely O
the O
gentle O
Clara B-PERSON
was O
ruled O
by O
principle O
as O
with O
a O
sceptre O
of O
iron O
, O
he O
seemed O
|
     | O
utterly O
unable O
to O
comprehend O
why O
his O
talking O
carelessly O
, O
or O
even O
contemptuously O
of O
religion O
, O
|
     | O
should O
in O
any O
degree O
affect O
the O
preference O
which O
she O
had O
once O
confessed O
for O
him O
, O
and O
which O
he O
|
     | O
felt O
assured O
she O
still O
entertained O
. O
With O
passionate O
vehemence O
he O
urged O
the O
depth O
of O
his O
|
     | O
attachment O
, O
and O
his O
total O
indifference O
to O
everything O
in O
life O
but O
herself O
, O
while O
he O
warmly O
|
     | O
protested O
that O
she O
, O
and O
she O
only O
, O
could O
complete O
the O
reformation O
which O
her O
own O
influence O

     | O
already O
begun O

these O

  | O
To O
Marion B-ORG
's O
astonishment O
and O
dismay O
, O
Mrs. O
Penfold B-PERSON
was O
pacing O
about O
the O
room O
, O
evidently O
in O
a O
|
     | O
state O
of O
furious O
irritation O
  O
while O
in O
her O
hand O
she O
carried O
that O
endless O
bill O
, O
the O
growth O
of O
|
     | O
many O
years O
, O
for O
board O
, O
education O
, O
masters O
, O
and O
sundries O
, O
which O
had O
so O
often O
already O
greeted O
the O
|
     | O
unwilling O
eyes O
of O
her O
young O
pupil O
, O
whose O
whole O
inward O
spirit O
recoiled O
with O
shame O
and O
|
     | O
apprehension O
, O
while O
she O
silently O
measured O
the O
length O
and O
breadth O
of O
its O
contents O
, O
every O
item O
of O
|
     | O
which O
she O
already O
knew O
by O
heart O
, O
and O
could O
almost O
have O
recapitulated O
without O
a O
prompter O
. O
| 
  | O
Had O
Marion O
herself O
been O
a O
ruined O
gamester O
or O
a O
spendthrift O
, O
she O
could O
scarcely O
have O
felt O
more O
|
     | O
guilty O
and O
ashamed O
than O
now O
  O
but O
after O
standing O
an B-TIME
entire I-TIME
minute I-TIME
without O
being O
observed O
, O
and O
|
     | O
perceiving O
Mrs. O
Penfold B-PERSON
unable O
to O
speak O
, O
from O
the O
effort O
it O
cost O
to O
restrain O
her O
anger O
within O
|
     | O
decent O
bounds O
, O
Marion B-ORG
, O
with O
the O
frankness O
natural O
to O
her O
candid O
disposition O
, O
came O
at O
once O
to O
|
     | O
the O
point O
, O
saying O
, O
with O
heightened O
color O
, O
and O
scarcely O
articulate O
voice O
, O
while O
her O
beautiful O
|
     | O
deep O
intelligent O
eyes O
were O
fixed O
with O
an O
earnest O
gaze O
on O
Mrs. O

. O

  | O
" O
I O
fear O
no O

" O
No O

nor O
there O
never O

" O
thundered O
Mrs. O
Penfold B-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
voice O
that O
made O
the O
gentle O
Marion B-PERSON
|
     | O
absolutely O
cower O
before O
her O
. O
" O
There O
, O
Miss O
Dunbar B-PERSON
! O
look O
at O
that O
bill O
! O
" O
added O
she O
, O
flinging O
it O
|
     | O
furiously O
into O
the O
lap O
of O
Marion B-ORG
, O
who O
had O
sunk O
upon O
a O
seat O
. O
" O
How O
much O
will O
a O
shilling O
in O
the O

that O
? O
Four B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
guineas O
absolutely O
lost O

wasted O

squandered O
upon O
you O

" O
| 
  | O
Unable O
to O
speak O
from O
consternation O
, O
though O
such O
scenes O
were O
already O
but O
too O
familiar O
to O
her O
|
     | O
memory O
, O
Marion B-ORG
fixed O
her O
eyes O
on O
the O
unwelcome O
bill O
, O
apparently O
examining O
its O
contents O
, O
while O
|
     | O
her O
thoughts O
were O
in O
the O
mean O
time O
painfully O
occupied O
in O
devising O
what O
would O
be O
right O
for O
her O
|
     | O
to O
say O
or O
do O
in O
this O
unexpected O
crisis O
. O
A O
long O
pause O
ensued O
, O
during O
which O
Mrs. O
Penfold B-PERSON
seemed O
|
     | O
resolute O
not O
to O
speak O
  O
therefore O
Marion B-ORG
, O
with O
a O
strenuous O
effort O
, O
endeavored O
to O
new O
- O
string O
her O
|
     | O
nerves O
, O
and O
say O
something O
, O
while O
the O
large O
heavy O
tears O
forced O
themselves O
into O
her O
eyes O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Mrs. O
Penfold B-PERSON
, O
" O
replied O
she O
earnestly O
, O
" O
you O
know O
how O
ready O
I O
would O
be O
to O
send O
my O
brother O

     | O
another O
letter O
of O
remonstrance O
, O
if O
that O
could O
be O

any O

, O
but O
now O
he O
never O
so O
much O
as O

     | O
answers O
me O

I O
seem O
indeed O
to O

forgotten O

both O
Patrick B-PERSON

" O
| 
  | O
Marion O
paused O
to O
recover O
her O
voice O
, O
and O
to O
choke O
back O
her O
tears O
, O
after O
which O
she O
continued O
in O
|
     | O
a O
firmer O
tone O
, O
while O
Mrs. O
Penfold B-PERSON
listened O
, O
with O
a O
dry O
, O
harsh O
, O
unmoved O
expression O
of O
|
     | O
countenance O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
You O
are O
justly O
dissatisfied O
about O

the O
least O

send O
me O
immediately O
home O

I O
dare O
not O
go O
of O
myself O

     | O
you O
have O
power O
to O
dismiss O
me O

it O

done O

The O
sorrow O

all O

mine O

" O
Miss O
Dunbar B-PERSON
! O
you O
have O
anticipated O
exactly O
what O
I O
am O
obliged O

do O
, O

what O
it O
would O
have O

been O
well O

if O
I O

replied O
Mrs. O
Penfold B-PERSON
, O
angrily O
flouncing O
into O
a O
chair O
, O

     | O
and O
pirouetting O
it O
almost O
round O
, O
so O
as O
to O
look O
Marion B-ORG
full O
in O
the O
face O
. O
" O
I O
am O
sorry O
for O
you O

certainly O

because O

your O
music O
is O
not O

exactly O
such O

to O
do O
me O
much O
credit O
, O
and O
your O
|
     | O
Italian B-NORP
is O
sometimes O
far O
from O
grammatical O
, O
yet O
on O
the O
whole O
there O
can O
not O
be O
a O
better O

disposed O

me O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Marion B-ORG
's O
heart O
was O
melted O
by O
even O
this O
very O
slight O
expression O
of O
regard O
, O
and O
nothing O
could O
|
     | O
exceed O
the O
troubled O
beauty O
of O
her O
eyes O
, O
when O
she O
raised O
them O
gratefully O
to O
Mrs. O
Penfold B-PERSON
, O
but O
|
     | O
conscious O
that O
her O
presence O
was O
not O
exactly O
the O
place O
for O
a O
scene O
, O
as O
that O
lady O
had O
long O
been O

     | O
considered O
incapable O
of O
a O
tear O
or O
a O
smile O
, O
she O
averted O
her O
face O
, O

struggled O
for O

     | O
composure O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
have O
learned O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O

" O
resumed O
Mrs. O
Penfold B-PERSON
, O
her O
voice O
becoming O
more O
|
     | O
stern O
as O
she O
proceeded O
, O
" O

in O
the O
most O

     | O
profligate O
manner O

paid O
off O
his O
creditors O

a O
shilling O

     | O
ruinous O
amount O

sanctuary O
at O
Holyrood B-ORG

refuge O

Mrs. O

angrily O
changed O
her O

with O
another O
indignant O
glance O
at O
Marion B-ORG

continued O
, O

" O
Even O
Sir O

While O
thus O
bemoaning O
herself O

Mrs. O

forgot O
, O
like O
most O
selfish O
people O

that O
any O

the O
pallid O
cheek O
of O
Marion O

testified O
in O

the O
depth O

with O

     | O
astonishment O

heard O
this O
short O
summary O

Sir O

history O

     | O
circumstances O

| 
  | O
Long O
after O
Mrs. O

ceased O
to O

Marion B-PERSON
gazed O
in O
her O
face O

as O
if O
expecting O
more O

her O
every O
nerve O
continued O
quivering O
with O
agitation O

till O
at O
length O
she O
closed O
her O
eyes O
in O

     | O
speechless O
agony O
, O
bewildered O
by O
the O
sudden O
transition O
from O
joyful O
anticipation O
to O
blank O
|
     | O
despair O
. O
Formerly O
she O
had O
heard O
of O
difficulties O

the O
bow O

dreadful O

those O
who O
might O
be O
affected O
by O

them O

quite O
foreign O

all O

over O

with O

destructive O

She O
yet O
felt O
as O

the O

some O
hideous O
dream O
from O

it O
might O
be O
possible O

     | O
awaken,—the O
voice O

painfully O
on O
her O
ears,—every O
surrounding O
object O
faded O

     | O
from O
her O
vision,—her O
thoughts O

confused,—a B-ORG
vague O
sense O

burning O
misery O

at O
her O

A O
tumult O
of O
gossiping O
wonder O

curiosity O
arose O
among O
the O
pupils O
, O
when O
it O

Many O
questions O
were O
asked O

much O
astonishment O

was O
expressed O
, O
and O
even O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
real O
sympathy O
excited O
, O

Marion B-ORG
shrank O
from O

not O
so O

guess O
the O
measure O

     | O
depth O
of O
her O
misfortunes O
. O
Often O
had O
she O
shared O
their O
sorrows O
, O
and O
willingly O
would O
she O
have O
|
     | O
accepted O
any O
consolation O
they O
could O
offer O
, O
but O
the O
worst O

her O
trials O
could O
not O
be O
spoken O
to O

     | O
mortal O
ears O
, O
and O
in O
lamenting O
for O
her O
brother O

disgrace O
, O
she O
could O
only O
bear O
her O
wound O

in O
an O

it O
seemed O
to O

as O
if O
she O
had O

     | O
really O
done O
so O
, O

the O
time O

Now O
, O
heavy O
with O

her O
room O

sank O
upon O
her O
bed O
in O
a O
paroxysm O
of O
tears O
, O
delivering O
herself O
up O

many O
painful O

rather O
to O

of O
all O

from O
hope O

It O
was O
during O

half B-TIME

after O

when O
Mrs. O

     | O
gasp O
of O

from O

The O

she O
might O
|
     | O
perhaps O
be O
able O
to O
do O
him O
, O
and O
the O
privations O
she O
could O
endure O
for O
his O
sake O
. O
The O
more O
proud O
, O
|
     | O
overbearing O
, O
and O
arbitrary O
, O
he O
had O
hitherto O
been O
, O
the O
more O
touching O
it O
appeared O
to O
her O
|
     | O
affectionate O
spirit O
, O
that O
one O
seemed O
born O
to O
command O
, O
should O
now O
be O
humbled O
  O
and O
impatiently O
|
     | O
did O
she O
long O
to O
prove O
, O
that O
, O
however O
all O
things O
might O
alter O
, O
yet O
, O
in O
prosperity O
or O
adversity O
, O
|
     | O
in O
sickness O
or O
in O
health O
, O
she O
was O
unchangeably O
the O
same O
  O
while O
her O
young O
heart O
glowed O
with O
the O
|
     | O
paramount O
hope O
of O
at O
last O
becoming O
useful O
to O
her O
brother O
, O
and O
therefore O
welcome O
. O
| 
  | O
As O
she O
proceeded O
, O
visions O
of O
deep O
distress O
and O
difficulty O
floated O
dimly O
through O
the O
mind O
of O
|
     | O
Marion O
, O
who O
could O
not O
entirely O
close O
her O
eyes O
against O
the O
iron O
truths O
, O
and O
stern O
realities O
of O
|
     | O
life O
, O
while O
considering O
how O
totally O
unsuited O
her O
brother O
was O
, O
to O
endure O
the O
privation O
of O
a O
|
     | O
single O
luxury O
, O
and O
now O
he O
could O
scarcely O
have O
enough O
to O
command O
the O
most O
ordinary O
|
     | O
necessaries O
. O
| 
  | O
In O
the O
mind O
of O
Marion B-ORG
, O
immediate O
starvation O
, O
and O
going O
out O
as O
a O
governess O
, O
were O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
ideas O
|
     | O
that O
most O
prominently O
connected O
themselves O
with O
the O
consciousness O
of O
being O
ruined O
  O
for O
her O
|
     | O
conception O
of O
bankruptcy O
was O
of O
the O
most O
terrifying O
description O
. O
| 
  | O
In O
the O
few O
novels O
she O
had O
ever O
seen O
, O
the O
heroines O
could O
always O
support O
themselves O
by O
selling O
|
     | O
their O
drawings O
  O
but O
Marion B-PERSON
did O
not O
hope O
to O
gain O
an O
independent O
livelihood O
by O
her O
slanting O
|
     | O
castles O
, O
and O
top O
- O
heavy O
trees O
, O
though O
taking O
in O
plain O
work O
, O
or O
teaching O
music O
, O
suggested O
|
     | O
themselves O
as O
possible O
resources O
. O
Marion O
thought O
of O
arrests O
, O
bailiffs O
, O
writs O
, O
and O
of O
the O
world O
|
     | O
come O
to O
an O
end O
. O
The B-TIME
sunny I-TIME
hours I-TIME
of O
her O
life O
seemed O
suddenly O
darkened O
, O
and O
she O
had O
grown O
old O
in O
|
     | O
a O
day O
! O
In O
the O
simplicity O
of O
her O
heart O
, O
she O
imagined O
that O
a O
ruined O
man O
of O
rank O
and O
fashion O
, O
was O
|
     | O
like O
a O
ruined O
man O
in O
earnest O
  O
obliged O
actually O
to O
reduce O
his O
establishment O
! O
to O
dismiss O
his O
|
     | O
servants O
! O
to O
dispose O
of O
his O
equipages O
! O
to O
make O
an O
auction O
of O
his O
furniture O
! O
to O
part O
with O
his O

     | O
plate O

and O
really O

live O
as O
if O

downright O

     | O
as O
Sir O

contemptuously O

The O

new O

     | O
St. O

formal O
yew O
hedges O
, O
clipped O
into O
fifty B-CARDINAL
unimaginable O
shapes O
. O
Marion O
was O
surprised O
, O
on O
hastily O

     | O
alighting O
, O
to O
perceive O
the O
whole O
house O
glittering O
with O
lights O
, O
and O
would O
have O
supposed O
she O
had O

     | O
made O
some O
mistake O
, O
had O
not O
the O
bell O
been O
instantly O
answered O
by O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
's O
own O
man O
, O
followed O

     | O
by O
the O
usual O
three B-CARDINAL
yellow O
- O
plush O
footmen O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Faithful B-WORK_OF_ART
creatures I-WORK_OF_ART
! I-WORK_OF_ART
" O
thought O
she O
, O
having O
often O
heard O
of O
old O
servants O
who O
insisted O
on O
being O

     | O
retained O
for O
nothing O
  O
" O
amidst O
all O
Patrick B-ORG

distress O
, O
this O
must O
indeed O
be O
gratifying O

" O
| 
  | O
In O
a O
tumult O
of O
emotion O
, O
Marion B-ORG
, O
throwing O
off O
her O
bonnet O
, O
rushed O
up O
a O
broad O
well O
- O
lighted O
|
     | O
flight O
of O
stairs O
, O
while O
, O
wound O
up O
to O
a O
pitch O
of O
heroism O
and O
romantic O
self O
- O
devotion O
, O
she O
thought O
|
     | O
only O
of O
her O
brother O
, O
impatiently O
longing O
to O
fly O
into O
his O
arms O
, O
and O
to O
express O
the O
whole O
fulness O
|
     | O
of O
her O
affection O
, O
and O
the O
whole O
depth O
of O
her O
sympathy O
. O
While O
her O
heart O
sprang O
forward O
to O
meet O
|
     | O
him O
, O
she O
eagerly O
threw O
open O
a O
door O
next O
the O
staircase O
, O
and O
entered O
with O
a O
hurried O
and O
tremulous O
|
     | O
step O
  O
but O
suddenly O
her O
eyes O
were O
dazzled O
and O
bewildered O
by O
the O
sight O
which O
met O
her O
agitated O
|
     | O
glance O
, O
while O
for O
a O
moment O
she O
became O
rooted O
to O
the O
floor O
, O
like O
one O
who O
had O
been O
stunned O
by O
a O
|
     | O
sudden O
blow O
. O
Marion O
gazed O
without O
seeing O
, O
and O
heard O
without O
knowing O
what O
was O
said O
, O
so O
|
     | O
unexpected O
and O
surprising O
was O
the O
scene O
to O
which O
she O
had O
thus O
suddenly O
introduced O
herself O
! O
| 
  | O
A O
murmur O
of O
noise O
and O
gayety O
rang O
in O
her O
ears O
, O
while O
the O
whole O
apartment O
was O
brilliantly O
|
     | O
illuminated O
, O
and O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
object O
which O
became O
distinct O
to O
her O
vision O
was O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
, O
seated O
|
     | O
at O
the O
head O
of O
a O
superbly O
- O
decorated O
dinner O
- O
table O
, O
in O
a O
perfect O
uproar O
of O
merriment O
and O
|
     | O
hilarity O
. O
Around O
him O
were O
placed O
five B-CARDINAL
or O
six B-CARDINAL
of O
his O
gayest O
associates O
, O
dressed O
in O
their O
scarlet O
|
     | O
hunting O
- O
coats O
, O
and O
evidently O
in O
joyous O
spirit O
, O
like O
school O
- O
boys O
during O
vacation O
, O
while O
the O
|
     | O
whole O
party O
presented O
a O
most O
convivial O
aspect O
, O
laughing O
in O
merry O
chorus O
, O
and O
with O
claret O
|
     | O
circulating O
at O
full O
speed O
round O
the O
hospitable O
board O
. O
| 
  | O
Marion B-ORG
felt O
as O
if O
her O
feet O
had O
lost O
all O
power O
of O
motion O
, O
while O
, O
grasping O
the O
handle O
of O
the O
|
     | O
door O
with O
one O
hand O
, O
and O
shading O
her O
eyes O
with O
the O
other O
, O
she O
became O
transfixed O
to O
the O
spot O
. O
It O
|
     | O
was O
a O
shock O
of O
unexpected O
joy O
, O
and O
while O
standing O
in O
the O
deep O
embrasure O
of O
the O
door O
, O
her O
large O
|
     | O
eyes O
dilated O
, O
and O
her O
lips O
parted O
, O
with O
an O
expression O
of O
speechless O
amazement O
, O
she O
looked O
like O
|
     | O
a O
breathing O
portrait O
, O
which O
an O
artist O
might O
have O
shown O
as O
his O
master O
- O
piece O
— O
young O
, O
bright O
, O
and O
|
     | O
graceful O
, O
as O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
crescent O
of O
the O
moon O
, O
or O
like O
the O
fabled O
houri O
of O
an O
eastern O
tale O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
gentlemen O
all O
instinctively O
stood O
up O
with O
one O
accord O
the O
moment O
she O
appeared O
, O
giving O
her O
|
     | O
looks O
of O
embarrassed O
astonishment O
and O
admiration O
, O
while O
Marion B-PERSON
hastily O
retreating O
, O
in O
an O
agony O
|
     | O
of O
confusion O
, O
heard O
her O
own O
voice O
inadvertently O
exclaim O
, O
" O
Patrick B-PERSON
! O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Marion O
! O
" O
cried O
her O
brother O
, O
in O
a O
frenzy O
of O
astonishment O
more O
than O
equal O
to O
her O
own O
, O
while O
|
     | O
the O
flowing O
bumper O
which O
had O
been O
raised O
to O
his O
lips O
remained O
suspended O
there O
, O
and O
in O
an O
|
     | O
instant O
afterwards O
, O
his O
tone O
of O
surprise O
became O
changed O
into O
angry O
imperative O
remonstrance O
. O
|
     | O
" O
Marion O
! O
what O
brought O
you O
here O
, O
child O

Before O
she O
had O
quite O
retreated O
, O
suspecting O
the O
real O
state O
of O
the O
case O
, O

not O
wishing O
for O

     | O
any O
public O
explanation O

Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
added O
, O
in O
an O
accent O
of O
careless O
good O
humor O
, O
" O

not O
large O
enough O

vanishing O
in O
a O
transport O
of O

     | O
joy O

her O

One B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
greatest O
pleasures O
in O
life O
is O
derived O
from O
the O
unexpectedness O
of O
events O
, O
without O

     | O
which O
existence O
would O
lose O
much O

its O
interest O
, O
and O
finding O
herself O
thus O
emancipated O
from O

school O

settled O
at O
home O
, O
and O
relieved O
from O
her O
worst O
fears O
respecting O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
, O
Marion B-PERSON
no O

     | O
sooner O
escaped O
from O
her O
unexpected O
glimpse O
of O
the B-ORG

     | O
lightly O
carolling O
some O
snatches O
of O
a O
popular O
song O

she O
flew O
up O

the O
happiest O

the O
scene O
of O

whom O
she O
discovered O
at O
last O
all O

The O
softening O
effect O
of O
happiness O
on O
stern O
and O
rugged O
natures O
has O
been O
often O
remarked O

     | O
selfishness O
never O
slumbers O
, O
and O
the O
reception O
Agnes B-LOC
bestowed O
on O
Marion B-ORG
partook O
more O
of O
|
     | O
astonishment O
than O
of O
pleasure O
, O
and O
was O
mingled O
much O
more O
with O
censure O
than O
with O
approbation O
. O

     | O
Still O
, O
after O
expressing O
more O
wonder O
than O
the O
occasion O
called O
for O
, O
what O
could O
possibly O
have O

     | O
brought O
her O
home O
, O
and O
the O

though O

     | O
not O
violently O
delighted O
at O
the O
unexpected O
meeting O

gave O
some O
fragments O
of O
her O
attention O
to O

     | O
Marion B-ORG
, O
whose O
deep O
tender O
eyes O
were O
sparkling O
with O
affectionate O
pleasure O
on O
again O
seeing O
her O

     | O
sister O
, O
while O
her O
countenance O
, O
from O
recent O
agitation O
, O
looked O
like O
an O
April B-DATE
face O
of O
smiles O

     | O
tears O

" O
What O

said O
Agnes B-LOC
, O
gazing O
with O
exultation O
at O
her O
own O
extraordinary O
beauty O
. O
" O
Pat B-PERSON
must O
find O

     | O
out O
some O

never O

Wear O
it O
yourself O
or O

it O

blue O
always O

I O
have O
lucky O

whispered O
Marion B-ORG

as O
soon O
as O
the O
abigail O

last O

frill O
disappeared O
. O
" O
I O
very O
seldom O
dislike O
anybody O
, O
Agnes B-LOC
, O
but O
she O
is O
very O
odd O
. O
There O
is O
a O
|
     | O
strange O
gleam O
about O
her O
eyes O
, O
which O
look O
so O
sharp O
and O
penetrating O
, O
they O
have O
prongs O

pierce O

turned O

" O

" O
Yes O

said O
Agnes B-LOC

laughing O
, O
" O
she O
does O
sometimes O
look O
through O

myself O
nailed O

" O

" O
Moreover O
, O
she O
has O
such O
a O
flattering O
, O
fawning O
, O
cunning O
manner O
, O
that O
I O
wonder O
you O
can O
tolerate O

     | O
her O
for O
an B-TIME
hour I-TIME
, O
" O
continued O
Marion B-ORG
. O
" O
We O
know O
so O
little O
of O
her O

too O

that O
she O

     | O
too O
, O
what O
low O

merely O
from O

I O
never O

you O
remember O
at O
the O
time O
I O
engaged O
Dixon B-PERSON

what O
a O

     | O
Pat B-PERSON

not O

to O
do O
her O
justice O
, O
she O
made O
it O
very O
entertaining O
. O
I O
hope O
, O

     | O
at O
least O
, O
the O
greater O
part O
was O
founded O
on O

" O

" O
Why O
does O
she O
wear O

some B-DATE

one B-DATE

in O
public O

at O
the O

a O

of O
madmen O

as O
they O
must O
have O
been O
at O
the O

drew O

up O

a O

precisely O
such O
an O

all O

wild O
expression O
|
     | O
of O
whose O
features O
filled O
her O
with O
indefinite O
apprehension O
. O
In O
her O
countenance O
there O
gleamed O
, O
|
     | O
certainly O
, O
for O
an O
instant O
, O
a O
dark O
smile O
of O
malignant O
satisfaction O
. O
Marion O
felt O
sure O
that O
it O
was O
|
     | O
so O
. O
Could O
the O
poor O
creature O
's O
mind O
be O
shipwrecked O
? O
Was O
she O
insane O
? O
Her O
look O
had O
become O
fierce O
|
     | O
and O
haggard O
, O
her O
forehead O
of O
a O
deadly O
paleness O
, O
and O
when O
she O
caught O
the O
eye O
of O
Marion B-ORG
earnestly O
|
     | O
fixed O
upon O
her O
, O
she O
started O
up O
, O
with O
a O
frown O
of O
angry O
defiance O
, O
and O
hurried O
out O
of O
the O
|
     | O
room O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
This O
is O
a O
most O
calamitous O
catastrophe O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
Agnes B-LOC
, O
disconsolately O
. O
" O
How O
could O
Dixon B-PERSON
be O
|
     | O
so O
intolerably O
stupid O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Are O
you O
quite O
certain O
it O
proceeded O
from O
stupidity O
? O
The O
accident O
is O
altogether O
very O
strange O
, O
" O
|
     | O
observed O
Marion B-ORG
, O
going O
close O
up O
to O
her O
sister O
, O
and O
relating O
all O
she O
had O
observed O
during O
that O
|
     | O
evening O
in O
the O
very O
lowest O
whisper O
, O
for O
Marion B-ORG
felt O
a O
nervous O
consciousness O
that O
Dixon B-PERSON
was O
not O
|
     | O
far O
off O
, O
and O
might O
attempt O
to O
overhear O
them O
. O
A O
stealthy O
step O
was O
heard O
on O
the O
stair O
after O
she O
|
     | O
concluded O
, O
but O
Marion B-PERSON
, O
thoroughly O
engrossed O
with O
the O
subject O
, O
reiterated O
once O
more O
her O
|
     | O
conviction O
that O
there O
had O
been O
something O
more O
than O
common O
in O
the O
manner O
of O
Dixon B-PERSON
, O
whom O
she O
|
     | O
advised O
Agnes B-LOC
to O
watch O
very O
carefully O
, O
if O
she O
did O
not O
part O
with O
her O
soon O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
You O
were O
always O
prejudiced O
against O
Dixon B-PERSON
, O
poor O
stupid O
fool O
that O
she O
is O
, O
Marion B-PERSON
. O
I O
wish O
I O
had O
|
     | O
sent O
her O
adrift O
before O
she O
broke O
all O
the O
china B-GPE
, O
but O
it O
is O
very O
unlike O
you O
to O
be O
so O
severe O
! O
How O
|
     | O
can O
you O
fancy O
the O
creature O
did O
it O
on O
purpose O
? O
That O
is O
too O
bad O
, O
when O
you O
might O
have O
seen O
how O
|
     | O
ghastly O
pale O
she O
became O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
did O
see O
, O
Agnes B-LOC
! O
and O
that O
makes O
me O
wonder O
only O
the O
more O
! O
No O
one O
ever O
looked O
like O
that O

     | O
surely O
, O
for O
breaking O
a O
few O
china O
gewgaws O

" O

" O
Marion O
! O
speak O
respectfully O
of O
my O
treasures O

But O
you O
are O
in O
a O
most O
censorious O
mood O
this O

     | O
evening O
: O
very O
different O
from O
common O
, O
when O
you O
are O
generally O
a O
knight O
- O
errant O
in O
all O
our O

     | O
conversations O

defending O

nothing O

my O

even O
Patrick B-PERSON

exceedingly O
ill O

, O
in O
not O
asking O

     | O
me O
to O
preside O
at O
his O
party O

The O
pretext O
was O
, O
that O
we O
had O
no O
chaperon O
, O

I O
had O
the O
greatest O

     | O
mind O
, O
in O
a O
fit O
of O
offended O
dignity O

good O

willing O
that O

circumstances O

CHAPTER O
XIII O
. O
| 
  | O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
, O
like O
most O
men O
who O
are O
gifted O
with O
more O
head O
than O
heart O
, O
disbelieved O
in O
all O
such O
|
     | O
generous O
emotions O
and O
exalted O
affections O
as O
he O
had O
not O
himself O
experienced O
. O
With O
a O
lively O
|
     | O
defiance O
of O
received O
opinions O
, O
his O
vivacity O
was O
unchecked O
by O
the O
fear O
of O
giving O
pain O
or O
of O
|
     | O
causing O
offence O
, O
being O
perfectly O
reckless O
on O
that O
score O
, O
provided O
only O
he O
could O
enliven O
the O
|
     | O
dull O
routine O
of O
ordinary O
society O
. O
Marion B-ORG
's O
mingled O
expression O
of O
shyness O
and O
animation O
, O
her O
|
     | O
light O
laughter O
and O
ardent O
feelings O
, O
were O
refreshing O
to O
a O
mind O
so O
hackneyed O
as O
his O
, O
and O
though O
|
     | O
he O
often O
checked O
her O
sensitive O
spirit O
in O
its O
full O
flow O
of O
affectionate O
confidence O
, O
by O
a O
retort O
|
     | O
courteous O
, O
or O
rather O
discourteous O
, O
he O
was O
nevertheless O
vain O
of O
the O
admiration O
she O
invariably O
|
     | O
excited O
, O
and O
read O
, O
in O
the O
eyes O
of O
others O
, O
the O
value O
he O
ought O
to O
place O
on O
her O
beauty O
and O
|
     | O
talents O
. O
| 
  | O
Agnes B-LOC
' O
whole O
mind O
was O
so O
frothed O
over O
with O
folly O
, O
and O
encrusted O
with O
selfishness O
, O
that O
unless O
|
     | O
the O
wheel O
of O
fortune O
touched O
upon O
her O
personal O
comforts O
, O
she O
was O
as O
impervious O
to O
all O
external O
|
     | O
impressions O
as O
a O
tortoise O
beneath O
the O
shell O
, O
and O
it O
was O
a O
useless O
waste O
of O
generous O
sentiments O
|
     | O
and O
kind O
emotions O
, O
whenever O
the O
heart O
of O
Marion B-ORG
was O
laid O
open O
to O
her O
. O
Agnes B-LOC
, O
who O
had O
long O
since O
|
     | O
adopted O
a O
company O
manner O
, O
and O
even O
a O
company O
voice O
, O
persuaded O
herself O
that O
Marion B-ORG
also O
had O
very O
|
     | O
cleverly O
" O
got O
up O
" O
a O
character O
on O
some O
imaginary O
model O
of O
excellence O
, O
which O
she O
acted O
over O
to O
|
     | O
the O
very O
life O
. O
It O
seemed O
to O
her O
a O
naked O
certainty O
that O
the O
refinement O
and O
delicacy O
natural O
to O
|
     | O
Marion B-ORG
's O
mind O
were O
in O
reality O
artificial O
  O
and O
though O
the O
radiance O
of O
her O
intellect O
, O
and O
the O
|
     | O
sensibility O
of O
her O
eye O
, O
were O
but O
in O
harmony O
with O
her O
actions O
, O
all O
testifying O
disinterested O
|
     | O
self O
- O
denial O
and O
invariable O
affection O
, O
still O
Agnes B-LOC
convinced O
herself O
that O
Marion B-ORG
lived O
" O
for O
|
     | O
effect O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
If O
Marion O
ever O
acted O
a O
part O
at O
all O
, O
it O
was O
only O
in O
concealing O
from O
those O
who O
might O
have O
|
     | O
ridiculed O
her O
, O
the O
unfathomable O
depth O
of O
her O
feelings O
, O
since O
she O
might O
as O
well O
have O
asked O
for O
|
     | O
sympathy O
from O
an O
ice O
- O
berg O
as O
from O
Agnes B-LOC
. O
Knowing O
that O
every O
evidence O
of O
sensibility O
would O
be O
|
     | O
received O
with O
scepticism O
, O
she O
silently O
and O
hopefully O
waited O
till O
some O
scope O
might O
be O
afforded O
|
     | O
her O
for O
testifying O
that O
all O
which O
she O
might O
have O
wished O
to O
profess O
was O
nothing O
to O
what O
she O
|
     | O
would O
do O
or O
suffer O
for O
those O
she O
loved O
  O
and O
if O
ever O
Marion B-PERSON
repined O
at O
any O
one B-CARDINAL
circumstance O
in O
|
     | O
her O
lot O
, O
it O
was O
, O
that O
she O
might O
perhaps O
pass O
through O
life O
unknown O
to O
those O
she O
loved O
the O
best O
, O
|
     | O
because O
she O
dared O
not O
express O
, O
even O
by O
a O
few O
insignificant O
words O
, O
that O
affectionate O
attachment O
|
     | O
to O
Agnes B-LOC
and O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
, O
which O
she O
would O
have O
thought O
any O
sacrifice O
a O
pleasure O
, O
to O
evince O
in O

     | O
its O
full O
and O
heartfelt O
measure O
. O
| 
  | O
One B-CARDINAL
privilege O
of O
friendship O
Marion B-PERSON
enjoyed O
in O
unbounded O
measure O
with O
both O
her O
brother O
and O
|
     | O
sister O
. O
She O
became O
the O
usual O
depositary O
of O
their O
many O
grievances O
and O
disappointments O
. O
Marion O
|
     | O
had O
the O
art,—or B-PERSON
rather O
the O
instinct O
, O
for O
to O
her O
all O
art O
was O
unknown,—of O
listening O
in O
|
     | O
perfection O
. O
If O
Agnes B-LOC
received O
a O
dress O
from O
her O
London B-GPE
milliner O
which O
did O
not O
fit O
, O
or O
if O
Sir O
|
     | O
Patrick B-PERSON
did O
not O
obtain O
an O
invitation O
to O
some O
jovial O
party O
which O
he O
had O
expected O
to O
enliven O
, O
|
     | O
Marion O
became O
of O
immediate O
importance O
. O
The O
annoyance O
he O
felt O
on O
such O
occasions O
could O
scarcely O
|
     | O
be O
exceeded O
— O
the O
death O
of O
his O
nearest O
relation O
, O
or O
of O
all O
his O
relations O
together O
, O
would O
have O

     | O
been O
nothing O
to O
it O
  O
but O
Marion B-PERSON
could O
always O
administer O
some O
gentle O
anodyne O
to O
the O
irritated O
|
     | O
sufferer O
, O
and O
displayed O
a O
wonderful O
ingenuity O
in O
turning O
up O
the O
best O
side O
of O
everything O
, O
for O

     | O
the O
advantage O

comfort O
of O

Nothing O
melted O
Marion B-ORG

heart O

entirely O
as O

Patrick O
for O
a O
moment O
depressed O
, O
as O
the O
very O
pride O

haughtiness O
of O
his O
spirit O
rendered O
it O
, O
in O

     | O
her O
estimation O
, O
the O
more O

could O
not O

fancy O

that O

a O

vivacity O
in O
his O

that O
the O
tone O
of O
his O

had O
a O
melancholy O
modulation O
when O
he O
bid O
her O
good O
night O
, O
accompanied O
by O
an O
unusual O
degree O

     | O
of O
kindness O
, O
always O
the O

a O

respecting O

dismissed O
her O

an O

     | O
anxious O
mind O

a O
prayer O

all O

welcome O
in O
the O

heart O
of O
Sir O

felt O

     | O
refreshed O

cheered O
by O
the O

of O

     | O
the O

Even O
Agnes B-LOC
, O
her O
own O
beautiful O
sister O
, O
looked O
very O
unlike O
Agnes B-LOC
! O
and O
she O
felt O
astonished O
to O
find O

     | O
that O
it O
might O
actually O
be O
possible O
to O
spend O
an B-TIME

her O
company O

not O

admiring O
her O
, O
but O
|
     | O
in O
Marion B-PERSON
's O
very O
private O
opinion O
, O
her O
appearance O
was O
now O
as O
if O
some O
sign O
post O
painter O
had O
done O
|
     | O
a O
resemblance O
of O
her O
sister O
in O
the O
very O
coarsest O
coloring O
, O
and O
in O
the O
most O
overdone O
style O
of O
|
     | O
dress O
and O
expression O
. O
| 
  | O
Agnes B-LOC
had O
a O
great O
deal O
to O
say O
, O
and O
no O
diffidence O
to O
prevent O
her O
saying O
it O
all O
, O
therefore O
she O
|
     | O
was O
now O
plunged O
into O
the O
midst O
of O
a O
very O
animated O
dialogue O
with O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
, O
talking O
|
     | O
with O
a O
look O
of O
conscious O
beauty O
and O
conscious O
success O
, O
in O
the O
only O
style O
she O
could O
talk O
, O
|
     | O
nonsense O
, O
and O
making O
a O
lavish O
expenditure O
of O
smiles O
, O
attitudes O
, O
and O
exclamations O
, O
to O
give O
|
     | O
herself O
the O
appearance O
of O
vivacity O
. O
Her O
hair O
was O
in O
a O
most O
disastrous O
state O
, O
and O
her O
complexion O
|
     | O
everything O
but O
what O
it O
should O
be O
, O
while O
her O
dress O
had O
so O
completely O
fallen O
off O
at O
the O
|
     | O
shoulders O
, O
that O
she O
might O
appropriately O
have O
sung O
her O
favorite O
air O
, O
" O

The O
expression O
of O
Agnes B-LOC
' O
countenance O
became O
at O
once O
perfectly O
natural O

when O
she O
turned O
round O
, O

     | O
and O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
observed O
, O
with O
a O
start O
of O
genuine O
astonishment O
, O
that O
Marion B-PERSON

beside O

, O
looking O
at O
the O
moment O
like O
some O

better O

Marion O
glanced O
at O
her O

embarrassment O

as O

It O
seemed O
perfectly O

unaccountable O

little O
as O
he O
knew O
how O
long O
his O

had O
been O

before O

of O

who O
no O
more O
credited O
the O
sincerity O

Marion B-PERSON

heart O
was O

, O

     | O
protected O
by O
the O
belief O
of O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
being O
her O
affianced O

therefore O
she O

she O
was O
in O
the O

of O
his O

     | O
how O
little O

When O
Captain O

observed O
Marion B-PERSON

good O

humored O
, O
careless O
manner O
in O
taking O
leave O
of O

     | O
him O
, O
he O
began O
to O
fancy O
it O
just O
possible O
she O
might O
still O
be O
quite O
indifferent O
to O
his O
attentions O
  O

     | O
but O
he O
rather O
indignantly O
resolved O
that O
this O
should O
not O
continue O
long O
. O
It O
would O
be O
a O

     | O
distinction O

he O
knew O
, O
to O
follow O
in O
the O
train O
of O
a O
young O
beauty O
so O
admired O
as O
he O
saw O
that O
Marion B-PERSON

     | O
must O
be O
  O
for O
a B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
tongues O
were O
already O
talking O
around O
him O
of O
her O
matchless O
loveliness O
, O
|
     | O
while O
he O
alone O
had O
yet O
enjoyed O
an O
opportunity O
of O
discovering O
that O
much O
as O
she O
was O
to O
be O
admired O
|
     | O
by O
those O
who O
saw O
her O
, O
she O
was O
still O
more O
to O
be O
loved O
by O
those O
who O
knew O
her O
  O
for O
she O
seemed O
to O
|
     | O
unite O
in O
herself O
all O
that O
he O
had O
ever O
praised O
in O
a O
thousand B-CARDINAL
others O
before O
, O
though O
he O
carried O
no O

     | O
plummet O
in O
his O
mind O
fitted O
to O
measure O
the O
depth O
of O
hers O

Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
had O
been O

     | O
accustomed O
, O
hitherto O
, O
always O
to O
feign O
more O
than O
he O
felt O
  O
but O
now O
, O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
, O
he O
found O

     | O
it O
necessary O
to O
conceal O
, O
even O
from O
himself O
, O
the O
extent O
of O
his O
feelings O
  O
for O
it O
seemed O
as O
if O
the O

therefore O
, O
he O
gave O
vent O
to O

by O
singing O

in O
a O
voice O

Marion B-ORG

a O
genius O
for O

happy O

much O

     | O
hurried O
along O

dimpling O
at O
the O
recollection O

while O

confidently O

from O
it O
, O
the O
amusement O

     | O
knew O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON

derive O
from O
her O

Marion B-ORG

As O
Marion B-ORG

within O

of O
the O

became O
more O
buoyant O

her O
thoughts O

     | O
more O

when O
, O
seeing O
Sir O

waved O

for O
your O
sakes O
only O
that O
I O

now O

the O
tattered O
shreds O
of O
my O
worn O

out O

, O
dear O
Marion B-PERSON

it O

" O

  | O
Marion B-ORG
clasped O
her O
arms O
round O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
's O
neck O
, O
and O
wept O
in O
silence O
. O
There O
was O
a O
weight O
of O
|
     | O
grief O
in O
all O
he O
had O
said O
, O
for O
which O
she O
was O
totally O
unprepared O
, O
and O
which O
she O
felt O
in O
every O
|
     | O
fibre O
of O
her O
heart O
. O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
's O
disgraceful O
conduct O
, O
and O
the O
impending O
departure O
of O
Henry B-GPE
, O
so O
|
     | O
long O
her O
companion O
and O
friend O
, O
were O
afflictions O
for O
which O
she O
was O
in O
some O
degree O
prepared O
  O
and O
|
     | O
they O
seemed O
as O
nothing O
, O
compared O
with O
what O
her O
venerable O
uncle O
said O
, O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
, O
of O
|
     | O
himself O
. O
He O
was O
a O
strong O
- O
minded O
man O
, O
unwilling O
to O
obtrude O
his O
infirmities O
and O
feelings O
on O
the O
|
     | O
notice O
of O
any O
one O
, O
anxious O
always O
rather O
to O
borrow O
cheerfulness O
from O
those O
around O
, O
than O
to O
|
     | O
cause O
anxiety O
or O
grief O
  O
but O
a O
sense O
of O
its O
absolute O
necessity O
had O
induced O
him O
to O
show O
Marion B-PERSON
, O
|
     | O
in O
some O
degree O
, O
her O
real O
position O
, O
and O
in O
doing O
so O
, O
had O
obliged O
him O
for O
once O
to O
speak O
of O
his O
|
     | O
own O
pecuniary O
losses O
and O
growing O
frailty O
. O
Long O
as O
the O
Admiral B-ORG
had O
been O
threatened O
with O
|
     | O
blindness O
, O
brought O
on O
by O
the O
pernicious O
climates O
in O
which O
he O
had O
served O
, O
the O
apprehension O
of O
|
     | O
actually O
losing O
him O
had O
hitherto O
been O
so O
far O
from O
Marion B-ORG
's O
thoughts O
, O
that O
she O
frequently O
|
     | O
pleased O
herself O
with O
anticipating O
the O
time O
when O
she O
might O
herself O
supply O
, O
by O
reading O
to O
him O
and O
|
     | O
walking O
with O
him O
, O
the O
place O
of O
that O
gloomy O
and O
spectral O
- O
looking O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
, O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
few O
|
     | O
people O
in O
the O
world O
whom O
Marion B-PERSON
disliked O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
that O
she O
almost O
envied O
him O
for O
being O
|
     | O
so O
constantly O
in O
the O
society O
of O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
, O
and O
for O
being O
so O
indispensably O
useful O
to O
him O
. O
| 
  | O
Marion O
felt O
that O
all O
the O
world O
would O
be O
cold O
and O
bleak O
to O
her O
indeed O
, O
as O
if O
the O
sun O
had O
left O
|
     | O
the O
firmament O
, O
if O
she O
lost O
the O
warmth O
of O
affection O
and O
kindness O
to O
which O
, O
from O
infancy O
, O
she O
had O
|
     | O
been O
accustomed O
, O
in O
the O
house O
of O
her O
beloved O
uncle O
, O
the O
only O
parent O
she O
had O
ever O
known O
. O
If O
such O
|
     | O
a O
misfortune O
were O
to O
come O
, O
who O
would O
then O
advise O
her O
— O
who O
would O
then O
be O
interested O
in O
her O
|
     | O
feelings O
— O
who O
would O
believe O
in O
the O
sincerity O
of O
her O
affections O
— O
who O
would O
be O
happy O
when O
she O
|
     | O
appeared O
, O
and O
grieved O
when O
she O
departed O
? O
All O
this O
rushed O
upon O
Marion B-ORG
's O
young O
mind O
when O
she O
|
     | O
arose O
to O
depart O
, O
while O
bitter O
tears O
coursed O
each O
other O
down O
her O
cheeks O
, O
and O
large O
drops O
stood O
|
     | O
in O
the O
nearly O
blinded O
eyes O
of O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
, O
which O
he O
endeavored O
to O
hide O
, O
as O
he O
affectionately O
|
     | O
embraced O
her O
, O
saying O
, O
in O
a O
tone O
of O
dignified O
, O
but O
melancholy O
composure O
, O
| 
  | O
" O
Come O
back O
soon O
, O
my O
dear O
girl O
! O
Let O
me O
see O
that O

often O

while O
I O
can O

at O
all O

" O

me O
remain O
with O
you O

whispered O
Marion B-ORG
, O
in O
a O
tone O
of O
the O
deepest O
earnestness O
, O
|
     | O
" O
dear O
uncle O

It O
is O
impossible O
to O
tell O
how O
happy O
I O
could O
be O
with O
you O

I O
have O
an O

     | O
abhorrence O
now O
, O
not O
to O

expressed O

of O
my O

seems O
little O
short O

swindling O
even O
for O
me O

to O
live O

with O
all O

CHAPTER O
XV O
. O
| 
  | O
Marion B-ORG
's O
walk O
back O
from O
Portobello B-WORK_OF_ART
was O
of O
a O
very O
different O
aspect O
from O
her O
gay O
outset O
in O
the O
|
     | O
morning O
, O
and O
nature O
seemed O
to O
have O
suddenly O
gone O
out O
of O
tune O
as O
she O
gazed O
around O
, O
with O
an O
|
     | O
altered O
eye O
on O
the O
sombre O
massy O
hills O
with O
their O
giant O
shadows O
, O
throwing O
into O
mysterious O
|
     | O
obscurity O
the O
tall O
ancient O
buildings O
of O
the O
doleful O
Canongate B-ORG
, O
which O
looked O
like O
the O
ghost O
of O
a O
|
     | O
departed O
city O
  O
and O
the O
melancholy O
magnificence O
of O
Holyrood B-ORG
reminded O
her O
of O
greatness O
in O
|
     | O
adversity O
, O
while O
she O
reflected O
that O
the O
royal O
houses O
of O
Stuart B-ORG
and O
of O
Bourbon B-PERSON
had O
there O
found O
a O
|
     | O
dismal O
refuge O
in O
their O
utmost O
destitution O
. O
But O
more O
immediately O
connected O
with O
herself O
, O
and O
|
     | O
more O
interesting O
still O
to O
her O
thoughts O
, O
though O
rather O
a O
sinking O
in O
poetry O
, O
was O
the O
|
     | O
consideration O
that O
there O
her O
own O
brother O
had O
been O
driven O
by O
his O
folly O
and O
indiscretion O
, O
and O
|
     | O
that O
her O
father O
's O
family O
, O
so O
long O
respected O
in O
Scotland B-GPE
, O
seemed O
now O
about O
to O
be O
finally O
|
     | O
extinguished O
in O
penury O
and O
disgrace O
. O
It O
was O
a O
misfortune O
without O
remedy O
, O
for O
Marion B-ORG
knew O
the O
|
     | O
limit O
of O
her O
influence O
with O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
to O
be O
less O
than O
nothing O
, O
and O
she O
believed O
that O
not O
a O
|
     | O
living O
being O
possessed O
more O
. O
She O
had O
never O
heard O
a O
surmise O
of O
his O
attachment O
to O
Clara B-GPE
, O
or O
deep O
|
     | O
and O
unconquerable O
as O
it O
was O
, O
she O
might O
have O
entertained O
some O
hope O
that O
the O
love O
of O
virtue O
and O
|
     | O
goodness O
in O
others O
, O
might O
lead O
to O
a O
respect O
for O
it O
in O
himself O
, O
though O
none O
can O
doubt O
the O
|
     | O
melancholy O
truth O
, O
that O
, O
as O
fevers O
are O
infectious O
, O
but O
health O
is O
not O
, O
so O
moral O
evil O
is O
far O
more O
|
     | O
contagious O
than O
moral O
good O
. O
| 
  | O
After O
a O
hurried O
walk O
, O
Marion B-PERSON
reached O
home O
in O
some O
trepidation O
, O
lest O
she O
might O
be O
too O
late O
to O
|
     | O
dress O
for O
dinner O
, O
an O
offence O
which O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
always O
visited O
with O
his O
utmost O
indignation O
  O
but O
|
     | O
on O
entering O
the O
house O
, O
she O
was O
alarmed O
and O
surprised O
to O
hear O
, O
from O
the O
butler O
, O
that O
Agnes B-LOC
had O
|
     | O
been O
seized O
with O
sudden O
illness O
very O
soon O
after O
her O
return O
from O
Lady B-ORG
Towercliffe I-ORG
's I-ORG
ball O
, O
and O
|
     | O
that O
she O
was O
unable O
to O
leave O
her O
bed O
. O
| 
  | O
Marion B-ORG
flew O
, O
rather O
than O
walked O
up O
stairs O
, O
and O
entered O
her O
sister O
's O
room O
with O
the O
most O
|
     | O
affectionate O
solicitude O
, O
but O
great O
was O
her O
astonishment O
to O
find O
Agnes B-LOC
stretched O
almost O
|
     | O
insensible O
on O
the O
bed O
, O
and O
evidently O
in O
an O
agony O
of O
suffering O
, O
pale O
, O
cold O
, O
and O
languid O
. O
Her O
|
     | O
spirits O
were O
evidently O
in O
the O
lowest O
depression O
, O
and O
, O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
in O
her O
life O
, O
she O
|
     | O
seemed O
to O
consider O
herself O
a O
mere O
mortal O
like O
other O
people O
. O
| 
  | O
Dixon B-PERSON
, O
in O
the O
mean O
time O
, O
watched O
over O
the O
invalid O
with O
an O
air O
of O
excessive O
, O
almost O
|
     | O
exaggerated O
solicitude O
, O
emitting O
a O
series O
of O
very O
ostentatious O
sighs O
, O
while O
she O
kept O
her O
place O
|
     | O
close O
beside O
the O
bed O
, O
so O
as O
to O
exclude O
every O
one O
else O
, O
and O
made O
eager O
signs O
to O
Marion B-PERSON
when O
she O
|
     | O
entered O
, O
to O
leave O
the O
room O
without O
speaking O
, O
and O
not O
approach O
her O
sister O
, O
or O
agitate O
her O
in O
any O
|
     | O
way O

Without O

any O
such O

however O
, O
Marion B-ORG
approached O
the O
bed O
- O
side O
with O
noiseless O

     | O
steps O
, O
and O
quietly O
assuming O
the O
place O
which O
had O
been O
occupied O
by O
Dixon B-PERSON
, O
gently O
took O
hold O
of O

     | O
Agnes B-LOC
' O
hand O
, O
which O
felt O
so O
cold O
and O
clammy O
, O
that O
she O
started O
with O
a O
degree O
of O
alarm O
, O
greatly O
|
     | O
increased O
by O
the O
sight O
of O
the O
invalid O

altered O
aspect O
. O

  | O
" O
Have O
you O
called O
in O
a O
doctor O

said O
she O
, O
anxiously O
. O
" O
Surely O

Dixon B-PERSON

thought O
nothing O

recommended O
me O
to O
put O
off O
my O
illness O

after O

assembly O

gone O
hunting O

added O
Agnes B-LOC
, O
with O
a O
peevish O
look O
at O
Marion B-ORG

as O
if O
it O
were O
her O
fault O

gone O
out O

I O
met O
him O
in O
the O
passage O

he O

     | O
had O
been O
told O

only O
of O
a O
slight O
nervous O
headache O
! O
" O
said O
Marion B-PERSON
, O
glancing O
at O
|
     | O
Dixon B-PERSON
, O
whose O
countenance O
wore O
an O
expression O
so O
sinister O
and O
peculiar O
, O
that O
Marion B-PERSON
felt O
the O
|
     | O
color O
rush O
to O
her O
face O
with O
surprise O
, O
but O
turned O
away O
instantly O
to O
conceal O
how O
much O
she O
had O
|
     | O
been O
startled O
by O
it O
, O
though O
determined O
privately O
to O
watch O
Dixon B-PERSON
's O
face O
more O
narrowly O
than O
|
     | O
before O
, O
while O
feeling O
a O
vague O
apprehension O
of O
she O
knew O
not O
what O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Miss O
Dunbar B-PERSON
must O
be O
kept O
quiet O
, O
" O
observed O
Dixon B-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
harsh O
sulky O
voice O
, O
" O
she O
ought O
not O
to O

     | O
speak O

It O
only O
fatigues O
her O

she O

no O
one O

" O

  | O
" O
Who O
ordered O
that O
? O
" O
asked O
Marion B-PERSON
with O
a O
scrutinizing O
look O
at O
the O
abigail O

averted O
face O

While O
she O
angrily O

slowly O
prepared O
to O
obey O
this O
authoritative O
command O
, O
Agnes B-LOC
turned O
her O

     | O
pallid O
face O
towards O
Marion B-PERSON
, O
saying O
, O
in O
a O
faint O
voice O
, O
and O
with O
a O
look O
of O
extreme O
lassitude O
, O
| 
  | O
" O
Dixon B-PERSON
says O
I O
have O
been O
in O
a O
delirium O
. O
She O
is O
probably O
right O
, O
for O
I O
could O
have O
been O
certain O
|
     | O
that O
when O
the O
shutters O
were O
closed O
, O
I O
heard O
a O
voice O
in O
the O
farthest O
corner O
of O
my O
room O
. O
It O
|
     | O
sounded O
like O
muttered O
curses O
, O
and O
a O
dark O
figure O
crossed O
the O
fire O
- O
place O
. O
Could O
it O
be O
a O
dream O
? O
I O
|
     | O
was O
too O
weak O
to O
move O
— O
my O
hand O
trembled O
, O
so O
that O
I O
could O
not O
reach O
the O
bell O
, O
but O
surely O
I O
heard O
a O
|
     | O
low O
, O
strange O
, O
unearthly O
laugh O
. O
It O
was O
horrible O
! O
but O
a O
moment O
afterwards O
Dixon B-PERSON
appeared O
, O
and O
she O

     | O
says O
I O
was O
in O
a O
deep O
sleep O

dreaming O

horrible O
dream O

said O
Marion B-PERSON
soothingly O
, O

was O
alarmed O
at O
the O
look O
of O
terror O

perplexity O
with O

something O

the O
tone O
of O
reproach O
in O

spoken O

It O
was O

up O

dashing O
the O

out O

amazed O

looked O
round O

beheld O

dark O
scowl O

the O

found O
it O

difficult O
every O

the O
bitter O

never O
seemed O
for O
an B-TIME

dormant O
, O
as O
she O
was O
perpetually O
making O
allusions O

very O
frequent O
irritation O

sometimes O
angrily O
left O

yet O
occasionally O

     | O
joined O
in O
her O
invectives O
against O

whole O

, O
in O
a O
tone O
of O
reckless O

angry O

     | O
derision O
, O
which O
was O
to O
Marion B-ORG
completely O
perplexing O

unaccountable O

dull O

     | O
out O
of O

  | O
Agnes B-LOC
one B-DATE
day I-DATE
jestingly O
announced O
to O

     | O
tickets O

dine O

the O
|
     | O
next O
morning O
she O
rather O
inconsistently O
found O
fault O

them O
, O
because O
at B-CARDINAL

twenty I-CARDINAL
poor O

     | O
people O
assembled O
at O
their O

be O
fed O

     | O

ascertaining O

never O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
adding O

     | O
her O
own O
name O
, O
as O
her O
purse O
was O
a O
complete O
valetudinarian O
, O
always O
complaining O
of O
exhaustion O
, O
yet O

     | O
always O
capable O
of O
any O

Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
also O
, O

he O

     | O
generally O
swore O
an O
impatient O
oath O

two B-CARDINAL
, O
when O
he O
saw O
the O
succession O
of O
dingy O
looking O
books O

     | O
brought O
into O
the O
drawing O

sometimes O
amused O
himself O
with O
a O
supercilious O
glance O
at O

     | O
contents O

the O
object O
was O

of O

appeared O
for O

small O
sum O

be O
able O
to O
afford O

convinced O

probably O
all O

     | O
not O

very O

splendid O
in O

exclaimed O

     | O
outrageously O
against O
the O
absurdity O
of O

trifle O
at O

" O

ever O

such O

Better O

him O
almost O

had O
been O

at O
Mrs. O

, O
to O
consider O

of O

, O
if O
she O

would O
consist O
in O
going O
once O
every O

     | O
Sunday B-DATE
to O
a O
pew O
in O
some O

where O
the O
stream O

     | O

appearing O
there O

she O
occasionally O
read O
prayers O
at O

in O
a O
careless O

     | O
mechanical O
way O

was O
anything O

more O

for O
the O

the O
door O
, O
in O
that O
|
     | O
most O
awkward O
and O
conspicuous O
of O
all O
situations O
, O
waiting O
for O
the O
chance O
of O
being O
shown O
into O
a O

     | O
seat O
by O
some O
compassionate O
pew O

The O
street O
had O
been O
crowded O
by O
a O
dense O
mass O
of O
carriages O
, O
while O
Marion B-PERSON
felt O
almost O
bewildered O
|
     | O
by O
the O
loud O
crash O
of O
equipages O
driving O
up O
and O
driving O
off O
, O
breaking O
the O
line O
and O
backing O
out O
, O
|
     | O
as O
if O
they O
had O
been O
assembled O
on O
the O
benefit O
night O
of O
some O
popular O
actor O
, O
while O
a O
flood O
of O
|
     | O
pedestrians O
crowded O
along O
the O
foot O
- O
path O
, O
as O
if O
their O
lives O
depended O
on O
being O
first B-ORDINAL
. O
She O
was O
|
     | O
astonished O
also O
at O
the O
unprecedented O
concourse O
of O
people O
already O
assembled O
in O
chapel O
, O
with O
|
     | O
looks O
of O
eager O
excitement O
and O
flushed O
expectation O
. O
Every O
aisle O
appeared O
filled O
to O
excess O
, O
and O
|
     | O
the O
staircase O
seemed O
one O
solid O
mosaic O
of O
faces O
, O
while O
the O
congregation O
were O
all O
crushing O
, O
|
     | O
elbowing O
, O
and O
pushing O
forward O
, O
in O
impatient O
haste O
. O
Voices O
were O
heard O
, O
at O
length O
, O
speaking O
|
     | O
aloud O
, O
in O
angry O
contention O
, O
for O
places O
— O
a O
sound O
which O
grated O
strangely O
and O
startlingly O
on O
the O
|
     | O
ear O
in O
a O
sacred O
edifice O
  O
and O
when O
at O
length O
the O
heat O
became O
unbearably O
intense O
, O
a O
loud O
crash O
|
     | O
was O
heard O
, O
of O
persons O
breaking O
the O
window O
for O
air O
. O
| 
  | O
Marion B-ORG
, O
intimidated O
at O
having O
ventured O
alone O
into O
so O
dense O
a O
crowd O
, O
and O
at O
a O
loss O
to O
guess O
|
     | O
what O
could O
occasion O
so O
much O
excitement O
, O
would O
have O
made O
her O
way O
out O
  O
but O
the O
pressure O
behind O
|
     | O
rendered O
it O
as O
impossible O
to O
retreat O
as O
to O
advance O
. O
On O
few O
occasions O
do O
people O
betray O
so O
great O
|
     | O
a O
want O
of O
kind O
consideration O
, O
and O
even O
of O
hospitality O
, O
as O
when O
comfortably O
ensconced O
in O
an O
|
     | O
extensive O
pew O
at O
church O
, O
occupying O
room O
enough O
for O
three B-CARDINAL
or I-CARDINAL
four B-CARDINAL
others O
, O
and O
carelessly O
staring O
|
     | O
at O
those O
who O
are O
vainly O
waiting O
, O
with O
hesitation O
and O
confusion O
such O
as O
Marion B-ORG
's O
, O
in O
hopes O
of O
|
     | O
being O
obligingly O
accommodated O
with O
a O
place O
. O
Her O
color O
deepening O
every O
moment O
, O
and O
her O
veil O
|
     | O
drawn O
closer O
, O
Marion B-ORG
shrank O
from O
notice O
, O
while O
one B-CARDINAL
person O
after O
another O
elbowed O
his O
way O
|
     | O
forward O
, O
and O
closed O
the O
door O
of O
his O
pew O
, O
with O
the O
authoritative O
, O
self O
- O
satisfied O
air O
of O
a O
|
     | O
proprietor O
, O
heedless O
how O
others O
might O
be O
situated O
  O
and O
still O
Marion B-ORG
anxiously O
glanced O
around O
|
     | O
her O
in O
vain O
, O
for O
the O
obscurest O
nook O
in O
which O
to O
subside O
unseen O
. O
| 
  | O
At O
length O
, O
when O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
loud O
peal O
of O
the O
organ O
had O
sent O
forth O
its O
solemn O
tones O
, O
summoning O
|
     | O
every O
heart O
to O
devout O
attention O
, O
Marion B-PERSON
felt O
a O
gentle O
touch O
given O
to O
her O
arm O
, O
and O
on O
looking O
|
     | O
round O
, O
her O
hand O
was O
clasped O
for O
a O
moment O
with O
a O
look O
of O
heartfelt O
affection O
by O
Clara B-PERSON
Granville I-PERSON
, O
|
     | O
who O
silently O
led O
her O
to O
the O
seat O
, O
at O
some O
distance O
, O
from O
which O
she O
had O
followed O
her O
, O
and O
giving O
|
     | O
one B-CARDINAL
more O
affectionate O
pressure O
of O
the O
hand O
to O
Marion B-ORG
, O
she O
composed O
herself O
into O
a O
look O
of O
|
     | O
devout O
and O
fervent O
attention O
, O
forgetful O
evidently O
of O
all O
but O
the O
important O
services O
of O
the O
|
     | O
hour O
, O
while O
Marion B-ORG
's O
heart O
beat O
with O
rapture O
to O
find O
herself O
once O
more O
beside O
her O
most O
beloved O
|
     | O
friend O
, O
and O
that O
friend O
unchanged O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
prayers O
were O
not O
merely O
read O
, O
but O
prayed O
— O
not O
in O
the O
every O
day O
matter O
- O
of O
- O
course O
tone O
, O
so O
|
     | O
common O
in O
the O
pulpit O
, O
nor O
in O
a O
pompous O
, O
self O
- O
sufficient O
, O
commanding O
voice O
, O
but O
with O
deep O
|
     | O
thrilling O
solemnity O
, O
and O
in O
a O
manner O
calm O
, O
graceful O
, O
and O
dignified O
, O
by O
a O
young O
clergyman O
of O
|
     | O
most O
intelligent O
and O
serious O
aspect O
, O
who O
evidently O
felt O
all O
he O
said O
, O
and O
became O
so O
utterly O
|
     | O
absorbed O
in O
his O
duty O
, O
that O
it O
appeared O
as O
if O
he O
almost O
imagined O
himself O
alone O
, O
and O
visibly O
|
     | O
present O
with O
the O
Divine O
Being O
whom O
he O
addressed O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
young O
preacher O
's O
appearance O
was O
singularly O
striking O
and O
prepossessing O
. O
His O
dark O
|
     | O
Spanish B-NORP
- O
looking O
complexion O
, O
and O
rather O
foreign O
features O
, O
were O
animated O
by O
an O
expression O
of O
the O
|
     | O
brightest O
intelligence O
, O
while O
in O
his O
eye O
might O
be O
traced O
the O
calm O
dignity O
of O
a O
highly O
|
     | O
cultivated O
intellect O
, O
and O
the O
benevolence O
of O
a O
Christian B-NORP
who O
hoped O
all O
things O
and O
believed O
all O
|
     | O
things O
, O
judging O
others O
as O
he O
would O
himself O
be O
judged O
. O
In O
preaching O
, O
he O
avoided O
the O
arena O
of O
|
     | O
controversy O
, O
but O
his O
arguments O
were O
clear O
and O
comprehensive O
, O
his O
eloquence O
irresistible O
, O
as O
|
     | O
much O
by O
the O
fire O
and O
splendor O
of O
his O
genius O
, O
as O
by O
the O
depth O
and O
solemnity O
of O
his O
reflections O
, O
|
     | O
while O
the O
attention O
was O
enthralled O
, O
the O
judgment O
convinced O
, O
the O
heart O
awakened O
, O
and O
the O
inward O
|
     | O
feelings O
touched O
in O
their O
most O
secret O
recesses O
. O
Without O
a O
thought O
of O
affectation O
, O
he O
was O
|
     | O
simple O
, O
dignified O
, O
full O
of O
earnestness O
, O
self O
- O
conviction O
, O
and O
fervent O
devotion O
, O
while O
there O
were O
|
     | O
passages O
of O
grandeur O
when O
he O
alluded O
to O
the O
solemn O
mysteries O
, O
and O
higher O
truths O
of O
revelation O
, O
|
     | O
which O
might O
have O
made O
a O
mere O
philosopher O
feel O
as O
if O
the O
wing O
of O
his O
imagination O
had O
been O
broken O
|
     | O
in O
attempting O
to O
follow O
  O
and O
yet O
there O
were O
thoughts O
and O
illustrations O
so O
clear O
and O
|
     | O
comprehensible O
, O
that O
any O
ignorant O
child O
from O
a O
charity O
school O
might O
have O
understood O
them O
. O
| 
  | O
Amidst O
the O
brighter O
scintillations O
of O
his O
genius O
, O
it O
was O
evident O
that O
he O
understood O
the O
whole O
|
     | O
alchemy O
of O
human O
nature O
, O
and O
while O
almost O
insensibly O
revealing O
the O
magnificent O
proportions O
of O
|
     | O
his O
own O
mind O
, O
he O
understood O
and O
sympathised O
with O
all O
the O
trials O
, O
temptations O
, O
and O
sorrows O
of O
|
     | O
human O
nature O
, O
and O
considered O
the O
whole O
art O
of O
happiness O
for O
man O
to O
consist O
in O
unreserved O
and O
|
     | O
heartfelt O
submission O
of O
his O
own O
will O
, O
his O
own O
hopes O
, O
wishes O
, O
and O
affections O
to O
the O
will O
of O
his O
|
     | O
Maker O
, O
desiring O
to O
have O
nothing O
, O
to O
be O
nothing O
, O
to O
do O
nothing O
, O
and O
to O
expect O
nothing O
, O
but O
|
     | O
according O
to O
His O
wise O
and O
holy O
decrees O
— O
to O
let O
the O
stream O
of O
events O
run O
on O
, O
seeking O
to O
extract O
|
     | O
the O
best O
happiness O
from O
them O
as O
they O
occurred O
, O
without O
one B-CARDINAL
rebellious O
wish O
that O
they O
had O
been O
|
     | O
otherwise O
, O
but O
only O
with O
a O
fervent O
prayer O
that O
they O
may O
, O
and O
a O
firm O
belief O
that O
they O
shall O
, O
|
     | O
carry O
him O
forward O
, O
though O
the O
course O
be O
rough O
and O
perilous O
, O
to O
a O
calm O
, O
bright O
haven O
of O
|
     | O
ceaseless O
and O
unutterable O
joy O
. O
| 
  | O
When O
the O
congregation O
had O
dispersed O
, O
with O
a O
degree O
of O
silence O
and O
solemnity O
very O
different O
|
     | O
from O
their O
noisy O
and O
irreverent O
entrance O
, O
Marion B-PERSON
walked O
for O
some O
time O
, O
leaning O
on O
the O
arm O
of O
|
     | O
Miss O
Granville B-PERSON
, O
but O
so O
entranced O
that O
she O
was O
unable O
yet O
to O
break O
the O
chain O
which O
had O
carried O
|
     | O
her O
mind O
and O
feelings O
captive O
to O
another O
and O
a O
better O
world O
. O
She O
had O
never O
before O
felt O
so O
|
     | O
deeply O
impressed O
with O
the O
transitory O
nature O
of O
all O
around O
her O
, O
the O
insignificance O
of O
those O
joys O
|
     | O
and O
sorrows O
with O
which O
she O
was O
encompassed O
, O
and O
it O
seemed O
to O
her O
but O
a O
day O
or O
an O
hour O
, O
till O
the O
|
     | O
curtain O
of O
eternity O
should O
rise O
, O
and O
the O
glories O
of O
a O
great O
hereafter O
become O
visible O
to O
her O
|
     | O
sight O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
You O
have O
been O
deeply O
interested O
by O
all O
we O
have O
heard O
? O
" O
said O
Clara B-PERSON
, O
in O
an O
accent O
of O
gentle O
|
     | O
interrogation O
, O
but O
with O
an O
expression O
of O
peculiar O
meaning O
in O
her O
countenance O
, O
which O
Marion B-ORG
was O
|
     | O
at O
a O
loss O
how O
exactly O
to O
interpret O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Interested O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
Marion B-PERSON
, O
with O
youthful O
enthusiasm O
. O
" O
If O
all O
the O
sermons O
I O
ever O
heard O

     | O
were O
compressed O
into O
one O

they O
could O
scarcely O
equal O
what O
has O
been O

to O
- O
day O

" O

you O
remember O
the O
preacher O

asked O
Clara B-PERSON
, O
coloring O
and O
smiling O
. O
" O

no O

how O
could O

both O

Mr. O
Granville B-PERSON
advanced O
to O
Marion B-ORG
with O
frank O
and O
prepossessing O
kindness O
, O
but O
though O
his O
manner O

     | O
was O
most O
ingratiating O
, O
his O
countenance O
wore O
an O
expression O
of O
pre O
- O
occupation O
and O
fatigue O
, O
while O

     | O
he O
walked O
hurriedly O
past O
, O
after O
cordially O
shaking O
Marion B-PERSON
by O
the O
hand O
, O
who O
observed O
to O
Clara B-PERSON

     | O
with O
surprise O
, O
that O
his O

feeling O

him O

a O
degree O

would O
scarcely O

The O
extravagant O
enthusiasm O
with O
which O
he O
has O
lately O
been O

makes O
him O
still O
more O

it O
lasts O
his O
influence O

nothing O

transient O

the O
popularity O
of O
a O

     | O

his O
chief O
solicitude O
is O
to O
remind O

that O
it O
is O
the O
word O
preached O

not O
the O

, O
" O
replied O
Clara B-PERSON
, O
" O
Richard B-PERSON
is O
deeply O
impressed O
with O
the O
danger O
to O
a O
preacher O
himself O
, O

     | O
arising O
from O
the O
adulation O
with O

     | O
that O
respect O
to O

he O
wishes O
to O
claim O
solely O

     | O
entirely O
for O
his O
Divine B-WORK_OF_ART
Master I-WORK_OF_ART
. O
He O
quoted O
to O
me O
yesterday B-DATE
a O
quaint O
old O
author O
, O
who O
says O
that O

     | O
God O
humbles O
men O
in O
this O
life O
, O
that O
He O
may O
exalt O
them O
forever O
  O
but O
Satan B-GPE
exalts O
men O
in O
this O

     | O
life O
, O
that O
he O
may O
cast O
them O
down O
for O
eternity O

It O
is O
a O
solemn O
truth O
, O

Richard B-PERSON
feels O
the O

     | O
danger O
as O
he O
ought O
. O
" O

  | O
" O
Then O
it O
is O
a O
danger O

, O

so O

Lady B-PERSON
Towercliffe I-PERSON
remarked O
, O
as O

came O
out O

that O

     | O
immortal O

" O

that O

no O
object O

My O

blessed O
with O
one B-CARDINAL

that O
is O
an O
actual O

No O

it O

down O

fashionable O

no O

If O

" O
No O

, O
as O
Richard B-PERSON
says O
, O
Christian B-NORP

     | O

     | O
with O
their O

so O
that O
, O

often O

From O
that O
memorable O
Sunday B-DATE
when O
Marion B-PERSON
first O
renewed O
her O
friendship O
and O
intimacy O
with O
Clara B-PERSON
, O
|
     | O
her O
fair O
young O
countenance O
brightened O
into O
its O
sunniest O
smiles O
, O
while O
day O
after O
day O
she O
carried O
|
     | O
her O
work O
to O
the O
little O
" O
cottage O
of O
contentment O
, O
" O
where O
Clara B-PERSON
generally O
received O
her O
in O
what O
she O
|
     | O
called O
her O
summer O
drawing O
- O
room O
, O
a O
small O
bowling O
- O
green O
in O
the O
garden O
, O
bright O
and O
shining O
as O
an O
|
     | O
emerald O
, O
beneath O
a O
grove O
of O
overhanging O
lilacs O
and O
laburnums O
. O
There O
Mr. O
Granville B-PERSON
frequently O
|
     | O
brought O
out O
books O
, O
which O
he O
read O
aloud O
and O
discussed O
, O
developing O
the O
lofty O
aspirations O
of O
a O
|
     | O
mind O
fitted O
to O
be O
high O
among O
the O
highest O
in O
learning O
and O
intellect O
, O
while O
his O
thoughts O
were O
|
     | O
like O
a O
well O
- O
tuned O
instrument O
, O
from O
which O
every O
chord O
sounded O
to O
the O
praise O
of O
their O
Divine B-PRODUCT
|
     | O
maker O
, O
and O
his O
conversation O
was O
, O
as O
Pascal B-PERSON
said O
of O
the B-ORG
Holy I-ORG
Scriptures I-ORG
, O
even O
more O
addressed O
to O
|
     | O
the O
heart O
than O
to O
the O
head O
. O
| 
  | O
When O
reading O
aloud O
, O
Mr. O
Granville B-PERSON
evinced O
so O
much O
interest O
, O
with O
so O
quick O
a O
consciousness O
of O
|
     | O
the O
author O
's O
meaning O
, O
and O
so O
true O
a O
sympathy O
in O
his O
sentiments O
, O
that O
it O
seemed O
as O
if O
he O
must O
|
     | O
himself O
have O
composed O
every O
line O
  O
and O
when O
he O
occasionally O
lent O
Marion B-PERSON
any O
volume O
that O
she O
|
     | O
particularly O
liked O
, O
she O
found O
his O
favorite O
passages O
marked O
, O
and O
the O
margin O
enriched O
by O
so O
many O
|
     | O
interesting O
notes O
, O
that O
she O
followed O
with O
delight O
the O
course O
of O
his O
mind O
, O
while O
at O
the O
same O
|
     | O
time O
storing O
her O
own O
memory O
with O
high O
thoughts O
and O
refined O
sentiments O
. O
| 
  | O
There O
was O
a O
degree O
of O
soul O
and O
spirit O
in O
the O
countenance O
of O
Mr. O
Granville B-PERSON
, O
which O
marked O
him O
|
     | O
as O
no O
ordinary O
man O
, O
and O
an O
indefinite O
charm O
in O
his O
grave O
and O
courteous O
manner O
, O
suited O
to O
his O
|
     | O
holy O
profession O
, O
and O
displaying O
the O
calmness O
and O
polish O
of O
one B-CARDINAL
accustomed O
to O
good O
society O
. O
He O
|
     | O
had O
an O
energy O
of O
expression O
irresistibly O
influential O
, O
while O
illustrating O
with O
an O
eloquence O
|
     | O
peculiarly O
his O
own O
, O
all O
the O
highest O
and O
holiest O
principles O
which O
can O
occupy O
the O
human O
heart O
. O

His O
master O

conversed O
of O
Milton B-GPE

Montgomery O
, O

of O
all O
the O
pious O

dear O
to O
every O
lover O
of O
nature O

of O
highly O
- O
wrought O
genius O
and O
devotion O
, O
while O
the O
most O

     | O
phlegmatic O
must O
have O
been O
roused O
, O
and O
the O
most O
passionate O
become O
subdued O
, O
by O
the O
indisputable O
|
     | O
dominion O
of O
a O
great O
mind O
, O
for O
his O
genius O
appeared O
to O
look O
upon O
the O
trifles O
of O
existence O
with O
|
     | O
the O
passing O
glance O
of O
an O
eagle O
in O
its O
lofty O
ascent O
. O
| 
  | O
Marion B-ORG
and O
Clara B-PERSON
were O
often O
entertained O
by O
Mr. O
Granville B-PERSON
when O
he O
related O
characteristic O
|
     | O
anecdotes O
of O
pious O
and O
literary O
men O
with O
whom O
he O
had O
associated O
, O
enlivened O
by O
original O
remarks O
, O

     | O
shewing O
strong O
powers O
of O
observation O
, O
and O
displaying O
the O
best O
side O
of O
human O
life O
  O
yet O
his O
wit O
|
     | O
and O
humor O
were O
evidently O
chastened O
and O
subdued O
by O
a O
thoughtful O
estimate O
of O
existence O
, O
and O
by O
a O

     | O
continual O
consciousness O
of O
his O
high O

, O
while O
Marion B-ORG
scarcely O
knew O
whether O
to O

most O

astonished O
at O
the O
versatility O

was O
a O
heart O
which O
required O
something O
in O
those O
she O
loved O
to O
reverence O
and O
look O
up O
to O
  O
|
     | O
but O
here O
she O
had O
found O
that O
in O
its O
fullest O
measure O
, O
and O
under O
the O
happiest O
auspices O
, O
among O
|
     | O
friends O
with O
whom O
she O
had O
never O
spent O
an B-TIME
hour I-TIME
without O
feeling O
the O
happier O
and O
the O
better O
for O
|
     | O
it O
. O
Now O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
she O
discovered O
that O
there O
is O
an O
aristocracy O
of O
conversation O
, O
which O
|
     | O
avoids O
everything O
low O
or O
mean O
in O
its O
origin O
, O
while O
a O
new O
world O
of O
ideas O
opened O
upon O
her O
, O
in O
|
     | O
listening O
to O
sentiments O
of O
high O
honor O
, O
and O
to O
feelings O
of O
universal O
benevolence O
. O
The O
genius O
of O
|
     | O
Agnes B-LOC
for O
conversation O
lay O
only O
in O
the O
line O
of O
scandal O
, O
and O
she O
was O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
sweeping O
|
     | O
away O
characters O
like O
cobwebs O
, O
at O
a O
single O
stroke O
, O
by O
remarks O
full O
of O
flippancy O
, O
and O
often O
using O
|
     | O
her O
talents O
as O
a O
mimic O
, O
while O
with O
tricks O
almost O
amounting O
to O
buffoonery O
, O
she O
rendered O
the O
best O
|
     | O
and O
most O
estimable O
of O
her O
friends O
, O
though O
above O
the O
reach O
of O
censure O
, O
at O
all O
events O
ridiculous O
. O
|
     | O
Ill O
- O
nature O
was O
to O
her O
conversation O
what O
fuel O
is O
to O
the O
flame O
  O
and O
Agnes B-LOC
piqued O
herself O
on O
her O

     | O
penetration O
in O
discovering O
the O
motive O
of O
others O
for O
all O
they O
did O
, O
while O
invariably O
tracing O
it O
|
     | O
to O
something O
mean O
or O
contemptible O
  O
but O
with O
Richard B-PERSON
and O
Clara B-PERSON
an O
equal O
ingenuity O
was O
shewn O
in O
|
     | O
tracing O
it O
to O
good O
  O
and O
while O
in O
the O
one B-CARDINAL
house O
every O
individual O
discussed O
was O
brought O
down O
to O
|
     | O
the O
same O
level O
of O
absurdity O
or O
selfishness O
, O
it O
was O
cheering O
and O
gratifying O
to O
a O
heart O
like O

At O
St. B-FAC

, O
when O
Marion B-ORG
heard O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON

Agnes B-LOC
discuss O
their O
acquaintances O
, O
she O
|
     | O
could O
not O
but O
wonder O
sometimes O
where O
all O
good O
or O
commendable O
people O
had O
hid O
themselves O
, O
as O
it O
|
     | O
seemed O
as O
if O
they O
must O
have O
fled O
from O
the O
face O
of O
man O
, O
or O
have O
closed O
their O
hearts O
in O
disgust O

     | O
from O
all O

with O
the O

world O
of O
fashion O
and O
frivolity O
  O
but O
now O
at O
last O
|
     | O
she O
had O
discovered O
some O
whom O
malice O
itself O
could O
scarcely O
criticise O
  O
and O
in O
thus O
associating O

     | O
intimately O
with O
the O
" O

, O
" O
she O
felt O
an O
increasing O
ambition O
to O
resemble O

     | O
them O
. O
| 
  | O
None O
were O
more O

something O
that O

that O

the O

  | O
Marion B-ORG

mind O
had O
always O
a O
propensity O
to O
admire O

and O
whether O
in O
nature O

in O
art O
, O
she O
found O

     | O
it O
more O
congenial O
to O
her O

ever O
to O
seek O
for O
beauties O
rather O
than O
defects O

therefore O
now O

     | O
she O
was O
delighted O
to O
associate O

who O
not O
only O
appreciated O
everything O

she O
did O
, O

     | O
pointed O
out O

in O
all O

     | O
she O
saw O
that O
Miss O

found O
the O
best O
relief O
from O

     | O
Marion B-ORG

not O

     | O
Clara B-PERSON

testified O
in O
deeds O
much O
more O
than O
in O
words O
, O
for O
good O
actions O

evidently O

     | O
considered O
as O
the O
necessary O
embellishments O
of O
that O
holy O
faith O
which O
alone O
can O
render O
any O

     | O
acceptable O

her O
feelings O

to O
the O
poor O

it O

scarcely O
a O

remained O
unspoken O

her O

consciousness O

the O
wide O

     | O
disparity O
between O
that O
home O

where O
she O
found O
nothing O

a O
heartless O
desolation O

neglect O
of O

     | O
her O

     | O
enhanced O
in O
pleasure O

importance O

the O
consciousness O

that O
beyond O

mere O
gratification O

     | O
of O
the O
moment O
, O

was O
consecrated O

that O
it O

remembered O

hereafter O

that O

a O
link O

the O
bright O
chain O
of O
eternal O
happiness O

were O
all O

The O
Christian B-NORP
friendship O
of O
a O
brother O

sister O
for O

is O
perhaps O
the O
purest O

happiest O
of O
all O

The O
affection O
of O
Clara B-PERSON

Marion B-PERSON

with O

every O
trivial O
incident O
of O
her O

rendered O
doubly O

     | O
important O
, O
because O
it O

The O
attachment O
of O
Agnes B-LOC
for O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
was O
like O
that O
of O

rattle O

compared O

all O
around O

occur O

probably O
the O
period O

the O
most O

take O
place O

gone O

day O

romantic O
glens O

Roslin B-PRODUCT

finding O
herself O

alone O

in O
one B-CARDINAL

her O

with O
manly O
frankness O

yet O
evident O
diffidence O
, O
an O

     | O
explicit O
declaration O
of O
his O
attachment O

said O
, O
on O
the O
occasion O
, O
all O
that O
could O
be O
said O
by O

man O

with O
the O
eloquence O
of O

emotion O

, O
encouraged O
by O
the O
timid O
pleasure O
with O

     | O
which O
Marion B-ORG
evidently O
listened O
to O
his O
words O

Mr. O

laid O
open O
the O
whole O
depths O

     | O
heart O
in O
which O
all O
that O
was O
ennobling O
in O
nature O
had O
become O
embellished O
by O
all O
the O
purifying O

     | O
influences O
of O
religion O
, O
while O
she O

with O
tears O

heard O
thus O
unexpectedly O
what O

     | O
promised O
her O
the O
utmost O
sum O
of O
human O
felicity O

attempted O
not O
to O
conceal O
how O
highly O
, O
|
     | O
beyond O
all O
expression O
, O
she O
appreciated O
his O
preference O

attachment O

There O
is O
a O
language O
of O
the O

words O

not O
express,—thoughts O

feelings O

     | O

Mr. O

deep O
gratification O

felt O
undoubtingly O

     | O
conscious O
that O

had O
become O
indeed O
an O
object O
of O
preference O
to O
Mr. O

, O
that O
she O
would O

     | O
be O
thought O

always O
by O
one O
whom O
she O
could O
never O

, O
that O

the O
whole O

of O
his O

that O

devoted O
to O
herself O
  O
and O
now O
|
     | O
resolutely O
discarding O
every O
apprehension O
of O
future O
difficulties O
or O
sorrows O
, O
all O
around O
took O
the O

     | O
color O
of O
her O
happiness O
, O
and O
she O
lived O
only O
in O
the O
joy O
of O
the O
present O
hour O
. O
Nothing O
required O
|
     | O
concealment O
between O
them O
, O
and O
it O
seemed O
the O
sole O
object O
of O
both O
to O
open O
up O
the O
most O
secret O
|
     | O
recesses O
of O
their O
minds O
, O
comparing O
opinions O
and O
feelings O
, O
while O
before O
long O
it O
appeared O
strange O
|
     | O
to O
Marion B-ORG
that O
a O
time O
had O
ever O
existed O
when O
their O
hearts O
were O
unknown O
to O

other O
. O
No O

     | O
caprices O
, O
no O
misunderstandings O
, O
no O
jealousies O
could O
arise O
between O
them O
, O
for O
there O
seemed O
to O
be O
|
     | O
but O
one B-CARDINAL
heart O
and O
one B-CARDINAL
mind O
in O
common O
, O
from O
the O
moment O
when O
Marion B-PERSON
whispered O
her O
confession O
, O
|
     | O
that O
their O
attachment O
was O
reciprocal O
. O
| 
  
  | O
Oh O
! O
there O
are O
looks O
and O
tones O
that O
dart O
, O
| 
  | O
An O
instant O
sunshine O
through O
the O
heart O
, O
| 
  | O
As O
if O
the O
soul O
that O
minute O
caught O
, O
| 
  | O
Some O
treasure O
it O
through O
life O
had O
sought O
. O
| 
  
  | O
At O
length O
they O
were O
warned O
to O
return O
homewards O
, O
by O
the O
golden O
light O
of O
a O
setting O
sun O
, O
which O
|
     | O
yet O
looked O
in O
glowing O
majesty O
over O
the O
distant O
hills O
, O
and O
sprinkled O
its O
glory O
on O
the O
highest O
|
     | O
tops O
of O
the O
trees O
, O
till O
they O
were O
tipped O
with O
fire O
  O
but O
Marion B-PERSON
paused O
, O
in O
delighted O
admiration O
, O
|
     | O
on O
the O
centre O
of O
a O
rustic O
fairy O
- O
bridge O
, O
like O
a O
spider O
's O
web O
, O
thrown O
across O
the O
narrowest O
and O

     | O
deepest O
part O
of O
the O
swollen O
stream O
. O
Among O
rock O
and O
moss O
, O
tufted O
with O
weeping O
birch O
, O
the O
|
     | O
overhanging O
cliffs O
here O
formed O
themselves O
into O
two B-CARDINAL
sides O
of O
a O
natural O
arch O
, O
in O
which O
nature O
had O
|
     | O
apparently O
omitted O
the O
key O
- O
stone O
, O
though O
art O
had O
supplied O
the O
deficiency O
, O
by O
a O
slight O
bridge O
, O
|
     | O
underneath O
which O
the O
sparkling O
waters O
boiled O
and O
thundered O
on O
with O
bewildering O
rapidity O
, O
like O
a O
|
     | O
stream O
of O
light O
, O
bounding O
and O
leaping O
, O
with O
a O
clamorous O
brawling O
uproar O
, O
along O
the O
rocky O
|
     | O
channel O
, O
and O
disappearing O
behind O
a O
bold O
promontory O
, O
over O
- O
grown O
with O
tall O
pines O
, O
and O
twisted O

     | O
with O
the O
knotted O
and O
gnarled O
roots O
of O
many O
an O
ancient O
oak O
. O

  | O
The O
country O
seemed O
indeed O
clothed O
with O
a O
prodigality O
of O
beauty O
— O
the O
wild O
confusion O
of O

     | O

the O

branches O
of O
a B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL

— O

, O
sprinkled O
like O

- O
gold O
on O
every O
object O
— O
the O

upon O

— O
the O
yellow O

     | O

, O
glowing O
with O
its O
sunny O
hues O
— O
the O

of O
well O
- O
conditioned O
cattle O
ruminating O
on O
the O

the O
stream O
, O
now O
murmuring O
in O
wild O
music O
over O
its O
rocky O
bed O
, O
and O
dimpling O
into O
|
     | O
smiles O
beneath O
the O
sunshine O
, O
while O
the O

of O

travelled O
into O
|
     | O
the O
highest O
regions O
of O

" O
that O

all O

that O

most O

     | O
precious O
to O
his O

how O
little O
of O
our O

from O

the O

are O
so O
important O

" O

musing O
together O
, O
in O

happiness O
, O
Mr. O
Granville B-PERSON
was O
suddenly O
roused O
, O
by O
|
     | O
observing O
a O
young O
lady O
approach O
with O
agitated O
and O
disordered O
steps O
, O
leaning O
on O
the O
arm O
of O
a O
|
     | O
more O
elderly O
female O
, O
and O
walking O
at O
a O
pace O
of O
such O
unusual O
rapidity O
, O
that O
it O
almost O
amounted O
to O
|
     | O
running O
. O
They O
both O
glanced O
frequently O
and O
hurriedly O
behind O
, O
as O
if O
under O
great O
alarm O
, O
while O
so O
|
     | O
remarkable O
an O
expression O
of O
terror O
was O
evident O
in O
all O
their O
looks O
and O
movements O
, O
that O
Mr. O
|
     | O
Granville B-PERSON
, O
without O
a O
moment O
's O
hesitation O
, O
stepped O
forward O
, O
and O
courteously O
volunteered O
his O
|
     | O
services O
, O
while O
Marion B-PERSON
with O
delighted O
astonishment O
, O
recognised O
her O
friend O
and O
companion O
, O
|
     | O
Caroline O
Smythe O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
You O
seem O
alarmed O
! O
Allow O
me O
to O
offer O
my O
assistance O
! O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Granville B-PERSON
. O
" O
Shall O
we O
accompany O

     | O
you O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
No O
! O
no O
! O
I O
am O
safest O
alone O
! O
" O
gasped O
the O
younger O
lady O
, O
in O
accents O
of O
wild O
alarm O
. O
" O
He O
carries O

     | O

you O
possibly O

him O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
Mr. O
Granville B-PERSON
glanced O
swiftly O
round O
, O
and O
observed O
, O
with O
surprise O
, O
not O
far O
from O
the O
bridge O
, O
|
     | O
and O
turning O
the O
sharp O
corner O
of O
a O
projecting O
rock O
, O
the O
figure O
of O
a O
tall O
, O
powerful O
young O
man O
, O
of O
|
     | O
rather O
gentleman O
- O
like O
appearance O
, O
wrapped O
up O
to O
the O
chin O
in O
a O
large O
cloak O
, O
who O
instantly O
, O
on O
|
     | O
perceiving O
strangers O
, O
muffled O
his O
face O
closely O
in O
his O
handkerchief O
, O
and O
drew O
down O
his O
hat O
, O
but O
|
     | O
approached O
with O
rapid O
strides O
and O
violent O
gesticulations O
, O
apparently O
speaking O
to O
himself O
, O
and O
|
     | O
muttering O
curses O
with O
terrifying O
vehemence O
. O
Not O
a O
moment O
was O
lost O
in O
hesitation O
, O
before O
Marion B-ORG
|
     | O
assisted O
the O
elder O
lady O
in O
supporting O
Caroline B-PERSON
onwards O
, O
who O
evidently O
suffered O
under O
a O
mortal O
|
     | O
terror O
, O
while O
they O
rapidly O
dragged O
her O
across O
the O
fragile O
bridge O
, O
on O
which O
Marion B-ORG
and O
Richard B-PERSON
|
     | O
had O
so O
lately O
enjoyed O
some O
brief O
and O
happy O
moments O
. O
| 
  | O
Mr. O
Granville B-PERSON
, O
in O
the O
mean O
time O
, O
approached O
the O
stranger O
so O
as O
to O
stand O
directly O
in O
his O
path O
, O
|
     | O
and O
necessarily O
to O
impede O
his O
progress O
, O
while O
he O
steadily O
fixed O
his O
gaze O
upon O
the O
blazing O
eye O
|
     | O
of O
the O
madman O
with O
a O
calm O
and O
commanding O
look O
, O
which O
testified O
an O
unflinching O
determination O
to O
|
     | O
obstruct O
his O
onward O
career O
, O
and O
a O
steady O
resolution O
not O
to O
be O
intimidated O
by O
the O
air O
of O
|
     | O
scowling O
defiance O
with O
which O
he O
was O
met O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Stand O
back O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
the O
stranger O
, O
in O
a O
tone O
of O
maniacal O
fury O
. O
" O
Life O
and O
death O
are O
at O
|
     | O
stake O
! O
stand O
back O
! O
delay O
me O
one B-CARDINAL
moment O
, O
and O
you O
die O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Is O
the O
bridge O
secure O
? O
" O
asked O
Mr. O
Granville B-PERSON
, O
catching O
hold O
of O
the O
madman O
's O
arm O
when O
he O
was O
|
     | O
rushing O
past O
, O
and O
instantly O
stooping O
down O
as O
if O
to O
examine O
the O
foundation O
, O
when O
, O
by O
a O
powerful O
|
     | O
effort O
of O
strength O
, O
he O
suddenly O
hurled O
the O
whole O
fabric O
into O
the O
eddying O
stream O
, O
which O
washed O
|
     | O
the O
shattered O
fragments O
in O
a O
moment O
out O
of O
sight O
. O
| 
  | O
With O
a O
cry O
of O
almost O
fiendish O
rage O
, O
and O
setting O
his O
teeth O
till O
it O
seemed O
as O
if O
they O
would O
be O
|
     | O
ground O
to O
powder O
, O
the O
maniac O
sprang O
like O
a O
tiger O
on O
Mr. O
Granville B-PERSON
, O
and O
would O
have O
collared O
him O
  O
|
     | O
but O
with O
great O
agility O
he O
eluded O
the O
madman O
's O
grasp O
, O
and O
fixed O
his O
eyes O
with O
an O
expression O
of O
|
     | O
stern O
resolution O
upon O
his O
frantic O
antagonist O
, O
till O
his O
face O
cowered O
beneath O
that O
steady O
gaze O
, O
|
     | O
when O
he O
said O
in O
a O
calm O
, O
slow O
, O
resolute O
accent O
, O
| 
  | O
" O
Those O
ladies O
shall O
pass O
on O
unmolested O
. O
It O
is O
base O
and O
cowardly O
to O
terrify O
timid O
females O
whom O
|
     | O
we O
are O
bound O
with O
our O
very O
lives O
to O
protect O
. O
Go O
back O
as O
you O
came O
, O
and O
beware O
of O
touching O
them O

     | O
or O
me O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
A O
wild O
and O
hideous O
laugh O
was O
the O
maniac O
's O
only O
reply O
, O
and O
his O
eyes O
gleamed O
more O
and O
more O
|
     | O
fiercely O
, O
while O
he O
gnawed O
his O
lip O
with O
rage O
, O
but O
at O
length O
suddenly O
bursting O
with O
irresistible O
|
     | O
fury O
past O
Mr. O
Granville B-PERSON
, O
he O
took O
a O
long O
, O
quick O
run O
to O
where O
the O
bridge O
had O
formerly O
stood O
, O
and O
|
     | O
instantly O
, O
with O
a O
single O
bound O
of O
marvellous O
agility O
, O
leaped O
across O
. O
Richard B-PERSON
Granville I-PERSON
was O
for O
|
     | O
half B-CARDINAL
a O
moment O
bewildered O
with O
astonishment O
at O
this O
unexpected O
achievement O
, O
and O
saw O
with O
|
     | O
consternation O
and O
dismay O
that O
it O
would O
be O
vain O
to O
attempt O
impeding O
the O
infuriated O
maniac O
, O
who O
|
     | O
turned O
a O
deaf O
ear O
to O
his O
loudly O
vociferated O
remonstrance O
, O
and O
deliberately O
fired O
a O
pistol O
in O
|
     | O
the O
air O
, O
while O
he O
held O
up O
another O
in O
a O
menacing O
attitude O
towards O
Mr. O
Granville B-PERSON
, O
and O
then O
|
     | O
replacing O
the O
deadly O
weapon O
in O
his O
breast O
, O
he O
hastily O
disappeared O
along O
the O
same O
path O
which O
had O
|
     | O
been O
so O
recently O
pursued O
by O
the O
ladies O
. O
| 
  | O
Richard B-PERSON
, O
heedless O
of O
any O
danger O
to O
himself O
, O
became O
now O
most O
seriously O
alarmed O
for O
the O
safety O
|
     | O
of O
Marion O
and O
her O
companions O
, O
therefore O
he O
delayed O
not O
an O
instant O
to O
scramble O
across O
the O
stream O
|
     | O
where O
it O
was O
fordable O
, O
and O
to O
follow O
at O
his O
utmost O
speed O
. O
In O
the O
impetuosity O
of O
Mr. O
Granville B-PERSON
's O
|
     | O
career O
, O
the O
ground O
receded O
beneath O
his O
feet O
, O
and O
as O
he O
rushed O
onward O
a O
band O
of O
iron O
seemed O
to O
|
     | O
restrain O
his O
breath O
, O
for O
the O
road O
became O
steeper O
and O
more O
solitary O
, O
while O
long O
grass O
and O
weeds O
|
     | O
had O
grown O
over O
the O
wheel O
tracks O
, O
and O
the O
way O
was O
impeded O
by O
wild O
straggling O
hedges O
, O
which O
threw O
|
     | O
their O
sprays O
of O
brier O
and O
thorn O
almost O
entirely O
across O
the O
way O
. O
At O
length O
meeting O
a O
couple O
of O
|
     | O
countrymen O
, O
he O
hurriedly O
explained O
his O
apprehensions O
, O
when O
they O
mentioned O
having O
met O
a O
strange O
, O
|
     | O
wild O
- O
looking O
man O
, O
proceeding O
with O
long O
strides O
in O
an O
opposite O
direction O
. O
To O
Mr. O
Granville B-PERSON
's O
|
     | O
great O
relief O
, O
however O
, O
they O
seemed O
to O
think O
that O
no O
ladies O
could O
have O
gone O
in O
that O
way O
, O
and O
|
     | O
after O
prevailing O
on O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
laborers O
, O
with O
a O
bribe O
, O
to O
assist O
him O
in O
capturing O
the O
maniac O
, O
he O
|
     | O
resolutely O
and O
fearlessly O
pursued O
his O
course O
. O
| 
  | O
Marion B-ORG
, O
meantime O
, O
had O
accompanied O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
ladies O
in O
their O
most O
unexpected O
flight O
through O
the O
|
     | O
forest O
, O
at O
a O
pace O
which O
precluded O
the O
possibility O
of O
speaking O
, O
except O
that O
now O
and O
then O
an O
|
     | O
ejaculation O
of O
terror O
, O
or O
an O
expression O
of O
fervent O
thankfulness O
was O
wrung O
from O
them O
when O
they O
|
     | O
glanced O
around O
, O
giving O
a O
fearful O
idea O
of O
instant O
danger O
. O
Caroline B-PERSON
's O
pallid O
lips O
were O
parted O
, O
|
     | O
her O
eyes O
straining O
forward O
with O
impatient O
apprehension O
, O
and O
every O
limb O
nerved O
for O
exertion O
, O
|
     | O
while O
she O
silently O
pursued O
her O
way O
, O
though O
her O
feet O
seemed O
to O
herself O
as O
if O
they O
had O
become O
|
     | O
lead O
, O
in O
her O
vehement O
efforts O
to O
fly O
onwards O
  O
and O
the O
countenance O
of O
her O
aunt O
expressed O
|
     | O
scarcely O
less O
terror O
. O
| 
  | O
Without O
speaking O
, O
Marion B-PERSON
did O
all O
in O
her O
power O
to O
accelerate O
their O
progress O
, O
but O
at O
length O
|
     | O
Caroline B-ORG
's O
footsteps O
faltered O
, O
her O
eye O
became O
dim O
, O
and O
she O
staggered O
back O
, O
faint O
with O
fatigue O
, O
|
     | O
seeing O
which O
Marion B-ORG
silently O
pointed O
to O
a O
large O
empty O
barn O
which O
stood O
beside O
the O
road O
, O
and O
|
     | O
having O
supported O
her O
within O
the O
door O
, O
Caroline B-GPE
fell O
helplessly O
on O
the O
floor O
, O
covering O
her O
face O

     | O
with O
her O
hands O
, O
and O
trembling O
visibly O
in O
every O
limb O
. O
| 
  | O
Marion O
brought O
water O
, O
rubbed O
Caroline B-PERSON
's O
temples O
, O
and O
tried O
by O
every O
means O
to O
soothe O
her O
with O
|
     | O
the O
hope O
of O
being O
safe O
, O
but O
in O
vain O
— O
her O
tongue O
grew O
parched O
, O
her O
eyes O
became O
glassy O
, O
her O
|
     | O
features O
almost O
livid O
, O
and O
she O
faintly O
pointed O
towards O
the O
door O

which O
Marion B-ORG
barricaded O
to O
the O

     | O
best O
of O
her O
ability O
. O
Caroline B-PERSON
threw O
herself O
back O
on O
a O
heap O
of O
straw O
, O
and O
covered O
her O
face O
with O

     | O
her O
hands O
in O
a O
helpless O
agony O
of O
fear O
. O
Several B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
afterwards O
elapsed O
in O
breathless O
silence O
|
     | O
on O
the O
part O
of O
Marion B-GPE
and O
Mrs. O
Smythe B-PERSON
, O
when O
Caroline B-PERSON
at O
length O
started O
up O
, O
eager O
to O
pursue O
her O
|
     | O
course O
towards O
the O
nearest O
village O
, O
now O
scarcely O
a B-QUANTITY
mile I-QUANTITY
off O
, O
while O
her O
companions O
earnestly O
|
     | O
entreated O
her O
to O
rest O
rather O
, O
and O
compose O
herself O
. O

  | O
" O
He O
has O
lost O
the O
track O
! O
he O
can O
not O
be O
following O

now O

" O
said O
Marion B-PERSON
, O
in O
accents O
of O
trembling O
|
     | O
alarm O
, O
the O
agitated O
tone O
of O
which O
belied O
her O
words O
, O
while O
an O
icy O
chill O
had O
crept O
through O
her O
|
     | O
veins O
. O
" O
Let O
us O
rest O
here O
, O
we O
are O
safe O
now O
! O
He O
will O
hurry O
past O

" O
He O

he O
will O
! O
when O
the O
fit O
is O
on O
nothing O
escapes O
him O
, O
" O
replied O
Caroline B-PERSON
, O
who O
felt O
a O
|
     | O
choking O
sensation O
in O
her O
throat O
which O
impeded O
her O
utterance O
. O
" O
Oh O
! O
think O
of O
the O
fearful O
past O
! O
|
     | O
that O
dreadful O
night O
when O
he O
first B-ORDINAL
became O
insane O
! O
Why O
did O
I O
believe O
him O
when O
he O
promised O
never O

     | O
to O
terrify O
me O
more O
! O
a O
horrid O
dread O
is O
upon O
me O
! O
a O
strange O
ringing O
in O
my O
ears O
! O
a O
weight O
of O
lead O

     | O
upon O
my O
heart O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
How O
wonderful O
that O
he O
never O
can O
be O
traced O

that O
he O
always O
finds O
us O
out O

that O

a O
moment O

we O
feel O
peculiarly O
safe O
from O
his O
presence O
, O
he O
comes O
! O
" O
whispered O
Mrs. O
Smythe B-PERSON
, O
|
     | O
in O
an O
under O
tone O
, O
as O
if O
afraid O
that O
the O
very O
walls O
might O
re O

echo O
her O
words O

" O
We O

" O

  | O
Before O
Caroline B-PERSON
could O
utter O
the O
affirmative O
, O
which O
trembled O
on O
her O
lips O
, O
her O
eyes O
became O
|
     | O
stony O
with O
a O
look O
of O
sudden O
fear O
, O
her O
hands O
were O
faintly O
clasped O
together O
, O
her O
parched O

livid O

were O
parted O
, O
and O
with O
a B-CARDINAL
half I-CARDINAL
uttered O
shriek O
she O
threw O
herself O
behind O
Marion B-PERSON

     | O
riveting O
her O
arms O
closely O
round O

the B-TIME

a O
window O
of O
the O

     | O
dashed O
in O
with O
a O
violence O
which O
nothing O

resist O
, O
and O
the O
maniac O
, O
giving O
a O
wild O
cry O
of O

     | O
malignant O
triumph O
, O
began O
to O
clamber O
in O
, O
clinging O
to O
the O
window O
- O
sill O
with O
his O
long O
bony O
fingers O
, O

     | O
while O
concealing O
his O
face O
, O
so O
that O
nothing O
could O
be O
seen O

his O
eyes O

with O
a O

testified O
in O
the O

with O
one B-CARDINAL

Caroline B-PERSON
tripped O
lightly O
into O

where O

so O
shaded O
by O

Sir O

very O
much O

replied O
Mrs. O
Smythe B-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
tone O
of O

     | O
increasing O
bitterness O

hurrying O
towards O
the O

evidently O
so O
irritated O

A O
glow O

fire O
rushed O
through O
Henry B-GPE

before O

     | O
closed O
the O

the O
hot O
blood O

sorrow O

The O
whole O

of O
his O
happiness O
seemed O
blasted O
at O
a O

     | O
single O
breath O
  O
his O
mind O
was O
a O
wild O
chaos O
of O
conflicting O
emotions O
  O
and O
one B-CARDINAL
only O
thought O
rose O

     | O
paramount O
to O
all O
, O
that O
he O
had O
been O
held O
up O
to O
ridicule O

contempt O

perhaps O

in O
the O

wreathed O

the O
whole O
rich O

that O
all O

the O

Henry B-ORG

     | O
Seeing O
him O
approach O
the O
table O
one B-DATE
day I-DATE
several O
times O
while O
she O
was O
writing O
, O
Marion B-PERSON
said O
at O

     | O
last O
, O
| 
  | O
" O

" O

said O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
low O
, O
agitated O
voice O

" O

" O
| 
  | O
Marion O
at O
these O
words O
glanced O
with O
astonishment O
towards O
Agnes B-LOC
, O
and O
privately O
thought O
her O

     | O
sister O
's O
lover O
must O
require O
very O
great O
encouragement O
indeed O
, O
if O
he O
were O
not O
satisfied O
with O
all O

     | O
he O
got O
  O
but O
unwilling O
to O
interfere O
in O
any O
differences O
that O
might O
have O
arisen O
between O
them O
, O
she O

     | O
calmly O
resumed O
her O
employment O
, O
unconscious O
that O
the O
eyes O
of O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
were O
fixed O
|
     | O
upon O
her O
with O
a O
look O
of O
disappointment O
and O
pique O
, O
because O
she O
had O
not O
so O
much O
as O
favored O
him O

     | O
with O
a O
conscious O
blush O
. O
| 
  | O
Nothing O
surprised O
and O
amused O
the O
young O
mind O
of O
Marion O
half O
so O
much O
, O
as O
the O
light O
raillery O
and O

     | O
gay O
persiflage O
, O
which O
continually O
passed O
between O
her O
brother O
and O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
, O
whose O

     | O
conversation O
was O
enlivened O
with O
sallies O
of O
good O
- O
humored O
malice O
against O
each O
other O
, O
and O
lively O

     | O
satire O
, O
which O
sometimes O
approached O
the O
verge O
, O
and O
often O
even O
passed O
the O
verge O
of O
civility O
, O

     | O
while O
each O
seemed O
to O
have O
conferred O
on O
his O
friend O
the O
royal O
privilege O
of O
saying O
or O
doing O
no O

     | O
wrong O
, O
so O
that O
the O
pointed O
arrows O
they O
levelled O
at O
each O

became O
feathers O
before O

His O
eye O
followed O

turned O

and O
he O
was O
now O
for O

by O
her O
side O

though O
she O
evidently O
made O
it O
her O
continual O

     | O
business O
to O
avoid O
him O

as O
she O

become O
more O
aware O

before O
of O

Fortified O
by O
the O
consciousness O
of O

by O
the O
knowledge O

belief O
in O

told O
every O

transient O
emotion O
of O
her O
heart O
, O
never O
betrayed O
a O
thought O
of O

and O
it O
seemed O
to O
Captain O

     | I-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
as O
if O
her O
heart O
must O

of O
granite O
, O
so O
cold O
and O
hard O
beneath O
a O

She O

     | O
was O
long O
of O

suspecting O
the O
worst O
, O
and O
would O
not O
fully O
believe O
when O
she O
did O
, O
that O
his O

really O
changed O

a O

Sir O

Agnes B-LOC
, O
who O
both O
, O
for O

     | O
different O
reasons O

insisted O
on O
her O

only O

spare O
the O

at O

escape O

any O

the O
fear O

One B-TIME
morning I-TIME
, O
when O

was O
seated O
in O
a O
state O
of O
exceedingly O
full O
- O
blown O
satisfaction O

expecting O
Captain O

either O
her O

observed O

who O
had O
occupations O
for O
every B-TIME
hour I-TIME
of O

     | O
the B-DATE

hastily O
gather O
up O
her O
drawing O

and O
glide O
towards O
the O
door O
, O
evidently O
anxious O

     | O
to O
escape O
without O
observation O
, O
but O
in O
vain O
. O

The O
barometer O
of O
Agnes B-LOC

countenance O
had O
become O
exceedingly O
stormy O
, O
while O
watching O
Marion B-PERSON

     | O
progress O
  O
and O
being O
one O
who O
rather O
enjoyed O
the O
excitement O
of O
a O
quarrel O
than O
otherwise O
, O
she O
|
     | O
asked O
Marion B-ORG
in O
a O
voice O
raised O
an O
octave O
higher O
than O
usual O
, O
which O
sounded O
as O
sharp O
and O
cutting O

     | O
as O
an O
east O
wind O
, O
where O
she O
was O
about O
to O
go O

adding O

in O
her O
most O
sarcastic O
tone O

know O
perfectly O
well O
that O
Patrick B-PERSON
may O
or O
may O
not O
be O
here O

for O
that O
all O

     | O
depends O
on O

nothing O

except O
there O

I O
expected O
more O

good O

humoredly O

seating O
herself O

, O
showing O
her O
the O
signature O

Marion O

" O
while O
a O

     | O
gleam O

light O
shot O
through O
his O
dark O
eye O

carnation O
mounted O

turned O
her O
large O
eyes O

stood O

     | O
at O
some O
distance O
placid O

secure O

in O
the O
certain O
belief O
that O
her O
own O
supremacy O
was O

     | O
established O
, O

that O
the O
conversation O
probably O
related O

almost O
inaudibly O
, O
in O
that O

low O

Marion B-ORG

dryly.—"That O

     | O
several B-TIME

in O
silence O

having O
accidentally O
opened O
the O

matrimony O
, O
he O

     | O
smilingly O
pointed O
it O
out O
to O
Marion B-ORG

down O

up O

a O
start O

astonishment O

at O
the O
hardened O
intrepidity O

Captain O

carried O
on O

Agnes B-LOC

as O

One B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
best O
receipts O
for O
happiness O
in O
this O

is O
, O
to O
make O
the O
utmost O
of O
small O

     | O
pleasures O
, O
and O
the O
very O
least O
of O
small O
vexations O
, O
which O
was O
the O
plan O
on O
which O
Marion B-ORG
invariably O
|
     | O
lived O
  O
and O
it O
often O
seemed O
as O
if O
all O
the O
duties O
of O
affection O
and O
friendship O
were O
written O
with O
a O
|
     | O
sunbeam O
on O
her O
mind O
. O
She O
now O
resolved O
, O
with O
characteristic O
kindness O
and O
good O
sense O
, O
that O
as O
her O

     | O
presence O
at O
St. B-FAC
John I-FAC
's I-FAC
Lodge I-FAC
could O
do O
no O
good O
to O
her O
sister O
, O
it O
should O
at O
least O
do O
no O
harm O
  O
|
     | O
therefore O
she O
determined O
if O

to O
obtain O
leave O

absence O
for O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
from O

     | O
to O
explain O

, O
her O
own O
opinion O

the O

     | O
perfect O
frankness O
between O

, O
however O

that O
no O

on O

     | O
any O
occasion O
where O
he O
has O
to O
act O

should O
be O
left O
in O
the O
dark O
as O
to O
his O
own O
actual O

     | O
position O

With O
a O
somewhat O
tremulous O
voice O
, O
and O
heightened O
color O
, O
Marion B-PERSON
proceeded O
next B-TIME
morning I-TIME
into O
her O

     | O
brother O

private O
sitting O
- O

where O
, O
surrounded O

armory O
of O
rifles O
, O

     | O
double O
- O
barrelled O
guns O
and O
pistols O
, O
she O
found O
him O
selecting O

weapons O
for O
a O
pigeon O

match O
to O

     | O
" O
come O
off O
" O
that B-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
between O
himself O
and O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
, O
of O
whose O
arrival O
he O
was O
in O
|
     | O
momentary O
expectation O
  O
and O
he O
seemed O
by O
no O
means O
inclined O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
to O
lend O
her O
much O
of O
his O

notice O

" O
I O
came O

mention O

that O
if O
you O
have O
no O

it O
is O
my O
wish O

spend O
a O

     | O
fortnight O
now O
, O
with O
uncle O
Arthur B-PERSON

" O
said O
Marion B-PERSON
. O
" O
We O
have O
met O
very O
seldom O
of O
late O
, O
and O
Henry B-PERSON
De I-PERSON

     | I-PERSON
Lancey I-PERSON

going O
off O
soon O

Did O
you O
hear O
that O

corps O

     | O
Captain O

been O

he O
is O
to O
join O
the O
depot O
for O
some B-DATE
months I-DATE
at O
Portsmouth B-ORG

what O
does O
all O
this O
matter O
to O
you O

you O

me O
till O

     | O
midnight B-TIME
! O
" O
exclaimed O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
, O
peevishly O
  O
for O
he O
felt O
by O
no O
means O
disposed O
that O
his O
house O
|
     | O
should O
lose O
the O
attraction O
of O
Marion B-ORG
's O
resplendent O
beauty O
. O
" O
If O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
in O
his O
dotage O
, O
|
     | O
chooses O
to O
make O
himself O
ridiculous O
about O
this O
anonymous O
youth O
, O
is O
that O
any O
reason O
why O
the O
whole O
|
     | O
family O
should O
go O
wild O
about O
him O
? O
Besides O
, O
Marion B-PERSON
, O
you O
confessed O
long O
ago O
, O
that O
Mr. O
Granville B-PERSON
|
     | O
visits O
at O
our O
uncle O
's O
  O
and O
I O
am O
determined O
that O
you O
shall O
learn O
to O
know O
your O
own O
value O
better O
|
     | O
than O
to O
take O
him O
! O
What O
has O
he O
to O
offer O
you O
but O
that O
trumpery O
little O
cottage O
, O
like O
a O

     | O
Tunbridge B-NORP
- O
ware O
work O
- O
box O
, O
a O
kitchen O
garden O
stocked O
with O
cabbages O
, O
or O
gooseberry O
bushes O
, O
and O
to O
|
     | O
live O
upon O
brown O
bread O
and O
water O
. O
But O
I O
begin O
to O
suspect O
, O
Marion B-PERSON
, O
that O
you O
are O
one O
of O
the O
very O
|
     | O
few O
people O
in O
this O
world O
who O
like O
their O
own O
way O
  O
therefore O
it O
is O
my O
duty O
to O
keep O
you O
here O
out O

     | O
of O
danger O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
wish O
to O
escape O
a O
danger O

rather O
than O
to O
encounter O
one O

" O
replied O
Marion B-PERSON
, O
with O
an O
ingenuous O
|
     | O
blush O
. O
" O
You O
know O
, O
Patrick B-PERSON

that O
I O
consider O

almost O
engaged O

Captain O
De B-PERSON

It O
|
     | O
would O
be O
a O
very O
great O
disappointment O
to O
me O
, O
and O
I O
think O
to O
yourself O
, O
if O
, O
after O
all O
that O
has O
|
     | O
passed O
, O
he O
become O
merely O
general O
in O
his O
attentions O
— O
showing O
no O
preference O
to O
one O
of O
us O
more O
than O

     | O
for O
another O

always O

fixing O
his O

trying O
to O

conceal O
a O
smile O

stern O

  | O
Hearing O
a O
slight O
noise O
, O
Marion B-PERSON
looked O
round O
, O
and O
she O
would O
have O
felt O
it O
rather O
a O
relief O
at O
|
     | O
the O
moment O
if O
the O
floor O
could O
have O
opened O
under O
her O
feet O
, O
when O
, O
with O
a O
gasp O
of O
consternation O
, O
|
     | O
she O
beheld O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
standing O
in O
an O
attitude O
of O
perplexity O
and O
irresolution O
near O
the O
|
     | O
door O
, O
evidently O
, O
for O
once O
in O
his O
life O
, O
feeling O
almost O
awkward O
, O
and O
very O
nearly O
abashed O
, O
though O
|
     | O
a O
moment O
afterwards O
he O
regained O
his O
usual O
matchless O
intrepidity O
of O
countenance O
and O
manner O
  O
when O
|
     | O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
advanced O
, O
with O
extended O
hand O
, O
to O
welcome O
him O
, O
saying O
, O
| 
  | O
" O
Ah O
! O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
! O
is O
that O
you O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
The O
same O
and O
no O
other O

" O
replied O
he O
, O
bending O
his O
riding O
- O
whip O
till O
it O
nearly O
broke O
  O
but O
|
     | O
assuming O
an O
Irish B-NORP
accent O
to O
conceal O
his O
annoyance O
. O
" O
The O
top O
of O
the O
morning O
to O
you O
both O

How O
is O

     | O
every O
inch O
of O
you O
? O
" O

  | O
" O
Very O
tolerable O
, O
indeed O
! O
It O
always O
does O
me O
good O
to O
be O
astonished O
, O
and O
certainly O
your O
|
     | O
apparition O
came O
rather O
unexpectedly O
. O
It O
made O
my O
mustachios O
perfectly O
stand O
upon O
end O
  O
and O
Marion B-PERSON
|
     | O
will O
not O
require O
a O
stroke O
of O
electricity O
for O
some O
time O
after O
this O
! O

seems O
rapidly O
petrifying O

     | O
into O
stone O
! O
" O

  | O
" O
Miss O
Marion B-PERSON

! O
if O
my O
presence O
be O
unwelcome O

I O
wish O
it O
were O
possible O
to O
dissolve O
away O
in O
|
     | O
the O
likeness O
of O
a O
sigh O
! O

said O
he O
, O
with O
a O
comic O
smile O

" O

I O
invite O
myself O
to O
sit O
down O
, O

any O

" O
If O
you O
are O
so O
exceedingly O
ceremonious O

to O
reach O
you O
a O
chair O

replied O

     | O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
, O
while O
his O
face O
became O
perfectly O
crimsoned O
with O
trying O
to O
suppress O
a O
burst O
of O
|
     | O
laughter O
, O
when O
he O
observed O
the O
graceful O
timidity O
of O
Marion B-ORG
's O
manner O
, O
contrasted O
with O
the O
easy O

     | O
assurance O
of O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
, O
who O
looked O
at O
her O
with O
undisguised O
admiration O
. O
" O
I O
had O
been O

     | O
inwardly O
betting O
with O

the B-TIME

     | O
Here O
is O
an O
undeniably O
fine O

me O
here O
for O
the O
strings O

How O
much O
her O
dog O
Darling O
has O
improved O
in O

     | O
the O
tone O

expression O
of O
his O
barking O
. O
" O

" O
Agnes B-LOC

those O

sermons O
against O
cruelty O
to O

     | O
would O
also O

a O
little O
against O

" O

" O
It O
is O
an O
amiable O
weakness O

" O
observed O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
tone O
that O
sounded O
very O
like O

     | O
contempt O

" O
I O
suppose O
your O

from O
which O
nothing O

deliver O
them O

death O

Marion O
colored O
to O
the O
very O
temples O

embarrassed O

the O
consciousness O
of O
all O
that O
Captain O
De B-PERSON

     | I-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
had O
evidently O
overheard O
, O
and O
after O
saying O
a O
few O
inaudible O
words O
, O
she O
would O
have O

     | O
hastened O
out O
of O
the O
room O
  O
but O
on O
looking O
round O
, O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
, O
who O
privately O
thought O
that O
on O
the O

     | O
present O
occasion O
there O
might O
be O
one O
too O
many O

strolled O
off O
to O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
, O
and O
as O
|
     | O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
continued O
speaking O
, O
she O
could O
not O
, O
without O
actual O
rudeness O
, O
withdraw O
. O
A O
|
     | O
blush O
is O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
most O
beautiful O
phenomena O
in O
nature O
, O
and O
so O
thought O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
, O
|
     | O
when O
he O
perceived O
Marion B-ORG
's O
color O
flitting O
like O
an O
aurora B-PERSON
borealis I-PERSON
, O
while O
for O
a O
moment O
she O

     | O
remained O
completely O
abashed O
, O
and O
then O
, O
with O
a O
look O
of O
apprehensive O
timidity O
, O
re O

seated O

herself O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Excuse O
me O
, O
Miss O
Dunbar B-PERSON

said O
he O
, O
in O
a O
tone O
of O
unwonted O
gravity O
and O
respect O
, O
while O
his O
usual O
|
     | O
self O
- O
confident O
audacity O
seemed O
entirely O
to O
have O
forsaken O
him O
. O
" O
I O
became O
inadvertently O
a O
|
     | O
listener O
to O
- O
day O
, O
when O
my O
name O
was O
mentioned O
by O
you O
in O
terms O
of O
which O
I O
must O
entreat O
an O
|
     | O
explanation O
. O
You O
will O
think O
me O
perhaps O
rather O
too O
much O
of O
the O
free O
- O
and O
- O
easy O
school O
, O
if O
I O
take O
|
     | O
this O
liberty O
  O
but O
the O
value O
I O
place O
upon O
your O
good O
opinion O
and O
cousinly O
regard O
is O
such O
, O
that O
I O

     | O
shall O
neither O
eat O
nor O
sleep O

you O
have O
enlightened O
me O
respecting O
the O
offences O
for O
which O
I O
am O

to O
be O
thus O
condemned O
unheard O

" O
Pray O
forget O
all O
that O

unaccustomed O

Marion B-PERSON

     | O

to O
look O

firm O
  O

seeing O
that O
Captain O

waited O
with O
an O

     | O
obvious O
resolution O

obtain O
something O
more O
explicit O

she O
felt O
herself O
urged O
on O
to O
say O
what O

under O
ordinary O
circumstances O
, O
she O
would O
have O
sunk O

  O
therefore O

     | O
assuming O
a O
certain O
haughty O
dignity O
of O
manner O
quite O
unusual O
with O
her O

she O
added O

" O

departure O

Yorkshire B-PERSON

after O
which O

seated O
himself O

     | O
before O
the O
dying O
embers O
of O
his O
fire O
to O

More O

possible O
to O

recalled O
again O

again O
to O
mind O
the O
thrilling O
tones O
of O
her O
voice O

and O
the O

     | O
matchless O
loveliness O
of O
her O
countenance O
, O
till O
at O
length O
his O
attention O
being O
roused O
by O
the O
clock O

     | O
striking O
two B-CARDINAL

he O
looked O
at O
the O
candles O
burning O
dimly O
in O
their O
sockets O

prepared O

good O
night O

When O
about O

his O
attention O

rustling O
noise O
behind O

shadow O

on O
the O
tall O
figure O

a O
woman O
enveloped O
in O
dark O

stood O

phantom O
close O
by O
his O
side O

without O
speech O

While O
his O
eyes O
were O
riveted O
in O
silent O

     | O
consternation O
on O
this O
mysterious O
apparition O

gradually O
the O
cloak O
was O
thrown O
aside O

the O
veil O

dropped O

a O
countenance O

disclosed O
so O
white O

rigid O
, O
so O
soul O
- O
stricken O
in O
sorrow O

so O

     | O
utterly O
without O
life O

motion O

it O
seemed O
as O

nothing O

have O
looked O
so O

supernaturally O
wretched O

No O
moisture O
flouted O
over O
her O
large O
dilated O
eyes O
, O
which O
were O
glassy O
and O

     | O
fixed O
, O
her O
parted O
lips O
were O
livid O
as O
death O

a O
mortal O
paleness O
was O
on O
her O
forehead O

cheek O
, O

     | O
and O
not O
a O
sound O
became O
audible O
, O
for O
the O
grave O
itself O
was O
not O
more O
silent O

With O
her O
emaciated O

     | O
hands O
riveted O
together O
, O
she O
stood O
the O
very O
image O
of O
woe O
  O
while O
nothing O
human O
appeared O
in O
her O

     | O
face O

its O
expression O
of O
mortal O
anguish O
. O

Captain O

his O

A O
vital O
horror O
thrilled O
through O
his O
heart O
  O
his O
eyes O
closed O
as O
if O
he O
would O
willingly O

     | O
have O
closed O
his O
vision O
against O
a O
sight O
which O
blasted O
him O
  O

at O
length O
, O
by O
a O
strong O
effort O

     | O
compelling O
himself O
to O
speak O

said O

in O
a O
low O

doubtful O
tone O

concentrated O

that O
it O
seemed O

scarcely O

     | O
her O

Captain O

she O
fixed O
on O
him O

a O
look O
of O
dismal O
meaning O
, O
the O
blackest O
eyes O
that O
ever O

     | O
vied O
with O
night O

Vainly O
he O
endeavored O
to O
withdraw O
his O
gaze O
from O
that O
wild O

haggard O

     | O
countenance O

to O
shut O
his O
ears O
against O
the O
tempest O
of O
her O
words O
  O
but O
there O
was O
a O
compression O

     | O
at O
his O
heart O
, O
till O
his O
very O
breath O
seemed O
difficult O
to O
draw O
, O
while O
he O
listened O
to O
her O
almost O

     | O
frenzied O
ravings O
. O
At O
length O
, O
in O
a O
voice O
of O
deep O
and O
solemn O
import O
, O
he O
addressed O
her O
, O
while O
the O

     | O
color O
fled O
from O
his O
very O
lips O
with O
agitation O
, O
and O
a O
cold O
shudder O
crept O
through O
his O
frame O
: O

ask O

would O

tamely O
down O

the O
suspicion O

swindling O
another O
out O

     | O
apprehensions O

sometimes O
crossed O

give O
me O
only O

act O

deep O
oath O

that O

When O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
called O
two B-DATE
days I-DATE
after O
this O
at O
St. B-FAC
John I-FAC
's I-FAC
Lodge I-FAC
, O
to O
take O
leave O
|
     | O
before O
setting O
out O
for O
Yorkshire B-PERSON
, O
he O
looked O
so O
absent O
and O
so O
agitated O
, O
that O
Agnes B-LOC
became O
quite O
|
     | O
elated O
and O
flattered O
by O
what O
she O
attributed O
to O
his O
unconquerable O
regret O
at O
being O
obliged O
to O
|
     | O
take O
so O
long O
a O
leave O
of O
herself O
. O
She O
even O
forgave O
him O
for O
enquiring O
almost O
immediately O
what O
had O
|
     | O
become O
of O
Marion B-ORG
, O
and O
answered O
with O
careless O
vivacity O
, O
" O
She O
is O
gone O
to O
her O
favorite O
home O
at O

     | O
Portobello B-WORK_OF_ART
. O
Marion O
perfectly O
idolises O
her O
uncle O
. O
I O
should O
require O
to O
attend O
a O
series O
of O
|
     | O
lectures O
on O
naval O
tactics O
, O
and O
to O
take O
a O
course O
of O
nautical B-CARDINAL
novels O
for O
a B-DATE
month I-DATE
, O
before O
I O
could O
|
     | O
get O
on O
with O
the O
Admiral B-ORG
as O
she O
does O
! O
My O
sister O
talks O
about O
the O
battles O
of O
Trafalgar B-PERSON
and O

     | O
Camperdown O
, O
as O
if O
she O
had O
fought O
at O
them O
herself O
, O
but O
really O
somehow O
or O
other O
, O
I O
never O
can O
find O

     | O
a O
word O
for O
good O
, O
worthy O
sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
! O
" O

  | O
" O
And O
yet O
, O
" O
observed O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
, O
" O
you O
never O
seem O
very O
much O
at O
a O
loss O

, O

     | O
when O
I O
have O
the O
pleasure O
of O

years B-DATE

suppose O
we O
go O
down O
together O
some B-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
and O
cut O
out O

     | O
Marion O
at O
once O
, O
by O
doing O
the O
agreeable O
in O
our O
very O
best O
and O
most O
fascinating O
style O
! O
" O

  | O
" O
If O
my O
uncle O
Doncaster B-PERSON
were O
such O
a O
man O
, O
I O
should O
certainly O
make O
up O
to O
him O
greatly O
! O
" O
said O
|
     | O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
tone O
more O
than O
commonly O
in O
earnest O
. O
" O
It O
would O
be O
well O
worth O
your O

     | O
while O

" O
| 
  | O
" O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
has O
nothing O
to O
leave O
! O
you O
are O
quite O
mistaken O
there O
! O
" O
replied O
Agnes B-LOC
, O
|
     | O
inadvertently O
. O
" O
When O
we O
were O
perfect O
children O
, O
and O
all O
on O
the O
very O
best O
terms O
, O
he O
used O
to O
say O
|
     | O
that O
it O
would O
be O
quite O
enough O
for O
an O
old O
sailor O
like O
him O
, O
if O
he O
could O
bequeath O
us O
his O
watch O

     | O
enough O
to O
bury O
him O
! O
As O
Pat B-PERSON
says O
, O
he O
might O
make O
his O
will O
on O
his O
thumb O
- O
nail O
. O
Oh O
! O
rest O
assured O

     | O
has O
nothing O
to O

" O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
did O
not O

continued O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
, O
gravely O
. O
" O
A O

feel O
that O

to O
imagine O
that O
Captain O

to O
keep O
up O
the O
farce O
with O
herself O
a O
little O
longer O

She O
felt O
certain O

     | O
that O
he O
had O
cast O
back O
a O
look O
of O
regret O

Agnes B-LOC
now O

over O
every O
scene O

She O

     | O
recapitulated O
all O

were O

, O
and O
|
     | O
feeling O
a O
consciousness O
of O
ability O
, O
he O
ardently O
longed O
to O
coin O
them O
into O
fame O
and O
distinction O
. O
|
     | O
Full O
of O
high O
aspirations O
, O
there O
was O
something O
grand O
in O
the O
outline O
of O
his O
head O
, O
and O
in O
the O
|
     | O
expression O
of O
his O
speaking O
eyes O
, O
while O
animated O
by O
his O
desire O
to O
render O
himself O
worthy O
of O

     | O
Caroline B-GPE
, O
and O
to O
reward O
the O
care O
of O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
by O
his O
own O
exertions O
. O
He O
longed O
now O
to O
run O
the O

     | O
race O
of O
life O
with O
others O
— O
to O
be O
useful O
among O
men O
— O
to O
win O
for O
himself O
a O
place O
in O
society O
— O
to O
write O
|
     | O
his O
name O
perhaps O
in O
the O
records O
of O
time O
— O

above O
all O

to O
promote O
the O
cause O
of O
truth O
, O
religion O
, O
|
     | O
and O
holiness O
. O
He O
had O
learned O
in O
the O
society O
of O
Mr. O
Granville B-PERSON
to O
believe O
that O
true O
happiness O
is O
|
     | O
not O
to O
be O
found O
in O
the O
temple O
of O
fame O
, O
nor O
in O
the O
temple O
of O
pleasure O

fortune O
, O
but O
in O
the O

     | O
temple O
of O
God O
  O
and O
at O
one B-CARDINAL
time O
his O
thoughts O
and O
studies O
were O
turned O
towards O
the O
church O
, O
with O
a O

     | O
fervent O
desire O
to O
take O
orders O
, O
till O
the O
tide O
of O
his O
plans O

entirely O
changed O

the O

     | O
unexpected O
arrival O
of O

the O
15th B-ORDINAL

quartered O
in O

bound O

from O
whatever O
hand O
it O
came O
, O
to O
accept O
. O
| 
  | O
Henry B-ORG
had O
been O
deeply O
affected O
when O
first B-ORDINAL
told O
all O
the O
peculiar O
circumstances O
of O
his O
own O

     | O
history O

Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
accustomed O
him O
from O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
to O
discuss O
the O
subject O
confidentially O
, O

     | O
that O
every O
recollection O
might O
be O
preserved O

involved O

none O

himself O

the O
secret O
of O
which O

     | O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
still O
entertained O
a O
sanguine O
hope O

often O

be O
forced O
or O
persuaded O
to O
acknowledge O

     | O
him O

Though O
lines O
of O
deep O
thought O
were O
already O
riveted O
on O
the O
youthful O
countenance O
of O
Henry B-GPE
, O
yet O
|
     | O
his O
manner O
became O
full O
of O
life O
and O
animation O
  O
and O
in O
personal O
courage O
he O
was O
the O
boldest O
of O
the O

bold O
, O
displaying O
a O
fearless O
energy O
of O

which O
caused O
the O
Admiral B-ORG
to O
express O

on O
the O

     | O
night O
when O
they O
were O
about O

a O
confident O
hope O
that O
, O

the O
service O
of O
his O
country O

     | O
had O
not O

his O
choice O

he O
was O

" O

     | O
exclaimed O
Henry B-GPE

warmly O
clasping O
the O

of O
his O

" O
Often O

They O
were O
to O
meet O
no O
more O
, O
as O
young O
De B-PERSON
Lancey I-PERSON
had O
engaged O
his O
place O
in O
the O
earliest O
coach O
|
     | O
next B-TIME
morning I-TIME
, O
and O
Marion B-ORG
saw O
, O
by O
the O
paleness O
of O
his O
cheek O
, O
and O
the O
compression O
of O
his O
lip O
, O

     | O
that O
though O
for O
worlds O
he O
would O
not O
have O
compromised O
his O
manhood O
by O
weeping O
, O
yet O
, O
moved O
as O
much O
|
     | O
by O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
's O
evident O
grief O
as O
by O
his O
own O

he O
had O
the O
utmost O
difficulty O
in O
suppressing O
a O

     | O
burst O
of O
tears O

  | O
The O
aged O
Admiral B-ORG
grasped O
his O
young O
friend O

hand O
in O
silence O
, O
and O
leaning O
for O
some O
moments O
on O

     | O
his O
arm O
, O
he O
walked O
up O
and O
down O
the O
room O
with O
heavy O
measured O
steps O
, O
his O
eyes O
cast O
down O
, O
his O
|
     | O
noble O
forehead O
clouded O
with O
care O
, O
and O
his O
brows O
knit O
as O
in O
deep O
and O
painful O
thought O
. O
He O
too O
|
     | O
seemed O
to O
dread O
the O
greatness O
of O
his O
own O
agitation O
, O
being O
little O
fitted O
now O
to O
bear O
any O
, O
yet O
it O
|
     | O
seemed O
to O
Marion B-PERSON
as O
if O
a O
tear O
had O
forced O
its O
way O
into O
his O
glazed O
and O
nearly O
blinded O
eyes O
, O

     | O
though O
carefully O
screening O
it O
from O
observation O

and O
evidently O
unwilling O

unable O

say O

After O
several B-TIME

had O
elapsed O

Henry B-PERSON
broke O
the O
long O

in O
a O
low O
, O

     | O
tremulous O
tone O
of O
incoherent O

Henry B-PERSON
paused O
in O
speechless O
emotion O

clenched O
his O
hands O
together O
, O
the O
youthful O
fire O

his O

he O
hurried O
to O

several O
moments O
, O
where O
, O
having O
in O
some O

recovered O
his O
composure O

down O

good O

venerable O
man O

of O
all O

upon O

the O
most O
affecting O
  O
and O
overcome O
with O
emotion O

Henry B-PERSON
took O
his O
benefactor O

hand O
in O

     | O
his O
own O
, O
with O
an O
expression O
of O
the O
deepest O
solemnity O

respect O
, O
saying O
, O
in O
rapid O

     | O
tremulous O
accents O

yourself O

Sir O

mournfully O
held O
out O
his O
hand O
to O
Henry B-GPE

who O
kneeled O
down O

kissed O
it O
with O
the O

     | O
profoundest O
reverence O
  O
then O
starting O
hastily O
up O

he O
seemed O
about O

rush O
out O
of O
the O
room O

when O

     | O
he O
was O
arrested O

the O
deep O

solemn O
voice O
of O
the O
Admiral B-ORG

eye O

in O

you O

that O

last O

In O
speaking O
of O

Henry B-PERSON
, O
do O
not O
suppose O
that O
the O

     | O
obligation O

all O

side O

No O
! O
your O
dutiful O

has O
more O
than O

paid O
me O

It O
is O

     | O
something O
to O
know O
that O
my O
aged O
years B-DATE
have O
not O
been O
spent O
in O
vain O
— O
that O
I O
leave O
a O
record O
in O
your O

     | O
heart O
, O
where O
my O
name O
will O
be O
respectfully O

affectionately O
remembered O

No O
man O
living O
can O

     | O
endure O
the O
thought O

being O
utterly O
forgotten O

to O
you O

my O
young O
friends O

I O
commit O
my O

     | O
memory O

The O
earth O
will O
lie O
lighter O
on O
my O
grave O
for O
the O
belief O

that O
you O
have O
loved O
me O
so O
well O
, O

     | O

will O
so O
truly O
lament O
me O

Your O
young O
spirits O
have O
cheered O
my O
heart O
— O
your O
welfare O
has O
deeply O

     | O
interested O
me O

I O
know O
that O
one B-DATE
day I-DATE

my O
young O

will O
do O
me O
honor O
in O
his O

     | O
profession O

not O
forget O

shed O
a O
tear O
over O
my O

" O

Many O
were O
the O
tears O

both O
Henry B-PERSON

Marion O
at O
these O
words O
  O
but O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
calmly O
continued O

     | O
in O
a O
firmer O
voice O
, O

" O
When O
I O
called O
you O
back O
, O
my O
dear O
Henry B-PERSON
, O
it O
was O
not O
for O
any O
vain O
attempt O
to O
express O
my O

     | O
feelings,—that O
would O
be O
impossible,—but O
to O
mention O
how O
, O
in O
all O
probability O
, O
you O
may O
one O
day O
be O

     | O
able O
more O
than O
to O
return O
the O
little O
I O
have O
done O
. O
It O
is O
easy O
for O
men O
to O
wrestle O
through O
the O

     | O
difficulties O
of O
life O
, O
and O
with O
such O
talent O

enter O

enterprise O
as O
yours O
, O
to O
conquer O
them O
all O

     | O
For O
other O
reasons O
, O
too O
, O
I O
have O
no O
doubt O
of O
your O
at O
last O
being O
most O
happily O
settled O
for O
life O
, O

     | O
but O
many O
anxious O
thoughts O
beset O
me O
respecting O
Marion B-PERSON

The O
uncertainty O
of O
Richard B-PERSON
Granville I-PERSON
's I-PERSON

     | O
prospects O
, O
and O
the O
certainty O
that O
my O
nephew O
will O
refuse O
his O
consent O
to O
her O
marriage O
, O
weighs O
|
     | O
heavily O
at O
my O
heart O
. O
I O
do O
trust O
that O
a O
long O
life O
of O
happiness O
awaits O
you O
both O
  O
but O
if O
my O
worst O
|
     | O
anticipations O
were O
ever O
to O
be O
realised O
— O
if O
your O
brother O
, O
Marion B-PERSON
, O
a O
bankrupt O
already O
in O
fortune O

     | O
and O
character O
, O
were O
hereafter O
to O
desert O
you O
— O
if O
your O
sister O
, O
heartless O

vain O
, O
should O
throw O
|
     | O
herself O
away O
, O
and O
leave O
you O
in O
bleak O
and O
sorrowful O
loneliness,—then O
remember O
, O
Henry B-PERSON
, O
my O
solemn O
|
     | O
and O
last O
injunction O
is O
laid O
upon O
you O
, O
to O
act O
as O
a O
brother O
towards O
Marion,—much O
may O
then O
be O
in O

     | O
your O
power O
— O
more O
than O
you O
now O
expect O
— O
and O
you O
must O
then O
protect O
her O
, O
as O
I O
would O
have O
done O
myself O

all O
that O
you O

would O

In O
the O

ample O

his O

long O

the O

his O

out O

Henry B-PERSON
was O
in O
the O
act O
of O
eagerly O
pursuing O
the O
rapidly O
receding O
figure O
, O
when O
, O
seeing O
Marion B-PERSON
|
     | O
stagger O
backwards O
, O
he O
caught O
her O
in O
his O
arms O
, O
supported O
her O
to O
a O
chair O
, O
and O
hastily O
bound O
up O
|
     | O
her O
wound O
, O
which O
was O
bleeding O
profusely O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Leave O
me O
! O
I O
am O
well O
! O
Look O
to O
my O
uncle O
, O
" O
cried O
she O
, O
eagerly O
. O
" O
He O
must O
have O
been O
alarmed O
! O
How O

     | O
was O
it O
, O
Henry B-PERSON
? O
Are O
you O
hurt O
? O
Is O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
safe O
? O
Oh O
! O
there O
he O
is O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
she O
, O
rushing O
into O
|
     | O
her O
uncle O
's O
arms O
, O
and O
bursting O
into O
tears O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Here O
is O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
too O
! O
" O
added O
Henry B-ORG
, O
turning O
round O
, O
as O
that O
gentleman O
entered O
with O
a O
calm O
|
     | O
but O
rather O
anxious O
look O
, O
while O
the O
paleness O
of O
his O
cheek O
was O
almost O
startling O
. O
" O
You O
seem O
, O
Sir O
, O

     | O
to O
have O
dropped O
ready O
dressed O
from O
the O
clouds O

" O

  | O
" O
I O
seldom O
retire O
early O
to O
bed O
, O
" O
replied O
he O
, O
with O
a O
quick O
, O
sharp O
, O
scrutinizing O
glance O
at O
|
     | O
Henry O
. O
" O
Hearing O
a O
tumult O
in O
the O
house O

I O

" O
| 
  | O
" O
You O
gave O
it O
time O
to O
subside O
before O
attempting O
to O
interfere O

added O
Henry B-GPE
, O
with O
a O
thrilling O
|
     | O
emphasis O
in O
his O
voice O
, O
while O
closely O
observing O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
's O
countenance O
. O
" O
There O
is O
a O
strange O

fearful O
mystery O
here O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
There O
is O

" O
replied O
he O
, O
gnawing O
his O
nails O
to O
the O
very O
quick O
, O
while O
he O
shot O
a O
momentary O
glance O
|
     | O
of O
rancorous O
detestation O
at O
young O
De B-PERSON
Lancey I-PERSON
, O
after O
which O
, O
his O
features O
became O
as O
passionless O
|
     | O
and O
immoveable O
as O
if O
they O
had O
been O
fixed O
in O
a O
vice O
. O
" O
The O
whole O
affair O
is O
mysterious O

very O
— O
— O

you O
already O
know O
all O
! O
" O

  | O
" O
I O
do!—I O
— O
I O
met O
the O
man O
rushing O
out O
of O
the O
house O
, O
" O
answered O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
, O
with O
the O
air O
of O
one B-CARDINAL
|
     | O
outfacing O
an O
accusation O
, O
but O
his O
voice O
became O
low O
and O
suffocated O
. O
" O
I O
attempted O
to O
stop O
him O
, O

     | O
but O
— O
— O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
am O
glad O
you O
did O
! O
" O
observed O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
, O
looking O
anxiously O
at O
Henry B-GPE
, O
and O
then O
gazing O
|
     | O
intently O
on O
the O
sallow O
countenance O
of O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
, O
which O
became O
gradually O
dyed O
with O
the O
deepest O
|
     | O
hectic O
  O
his O
lips O
were O
now O
closely O
compressed O
, O
he O
raised O
his O
tall O
figure O
to O
its O
full O
height O
, O
and O
|
     | O
closed O
his O
eyes O
, O
as O
if O
wishing O
thus O
to O
exclude O
some O
fearful O
spectre O
from O
his O
mind O
, O
but O
after O
a O
|
     | O
momentary O
struggle O
, O
he O
became O
once O
more O
calm O
and O
resolute O
, O
with O
a O
singular O
serenity O
of O
look O
and O
|
     | O
manner O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
You O
met O
some O
one O
in O
the O
passage O
! O
The O
assassin O
must O
have O
escaped O
long O
before O
! O
" O
muttered O
|
     | O
Henry O
, O
in O
a O
vague O
and O
dreaming O
tone O
  O
but O
his O
brow O
grew O
darker O
, O
and O
there O
was O
an O
anxious O
|
     | O
intensity O
in O
his O
look O
and O
voice O
, O
when O
he O
added O
in O
a O
tone O
of O
resolute O
determination O
, O
" O
Let O
me O
be O

     | O
plain O
with O
you O
, O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
! O
Your O
expression O
of O
countenance O
when O
I O
saw O
you O
last B-TIME
night I-TIME
, O
filled O
me O
|
     | O
with O
astonishment O
— O
almost O
with O
apprehension O
  O
it O
was O
a O
look O
never O
to O
be O
forgotten O
! O
Your O
manner O
|
     | O
now O
perplexes O
me O
! O
There O
is O
something O
amiss O
which O
I O
can O
not O
understand O
, O
but O
for O
your O
sake O
as O
well O

     | O
as O
my O
own O
, O
this O
very O
strange O
affair O
must O
be O
fully O
investigated O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
You O
suspect O
me O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
sudden O
laugh O
of O
terrible O
mirth O
, O
and O
in O
a O
voice O
|
     | O
elevated O
into O
accents O
of O
indescribable O
fury O
, O
while O
his O
eye O
throwing O
off O
the O
torpor O
in O
which O
it O
|
     | O
had O
been O
shrouded O
, O
glittered O
with O
the O
fearful O
brightness O
of O
delirium O
, O
his O
veins O
became O
swollen O
, O
|
     | O
and O
his O
figure O
dilated O
beyond O
its O
ordinary O
height O
, O
assuming O
an O
aspect O
of O
rage O
and O
of O
almost O
|
     | O
supernatural O
strength O
, O
such O
as O
insanity O
alone O
can O
give O
. O
" O
You O
suspect O
me O
, O

you O
have O
dared O
to O

     | O
confess O
it O
. O
Many O
a O
word O
lightly O
spoken O
carries O
weight O
. O
The O
arrow O
has O
been O
shot O
at O
random O
, O
but O

     | O
you O
are O
right O
. O
Lightning O
rushes O
through O
my O
brain O
! O
I O
would O
be O
destructive O
as O
a O
whirlwind O
to O
you O
, O
|
     | O
De O
Lancey O
, O
as O
I O
once O
was O
to O
your O
wretched O
mother O
. O
She O
stood O
in O
the O
way O
of O
my O
advancement O
, O
as O

     | O
you O
may O
yet O
do,—she O
accused O
, O
betrayed O
, O
and O
ruined O
my O
sister O

continued O
he O
in O
a O
rapid O
voice O
, O

     | O
insupportably O
shrill O
and O
piercing O
. O
" O
You O
too O
have O
injured O
me O

you O
shall O
suffer O
for O
it O

she O

     | O
did O
— O
she O
died O

  | O
With O
the B-DATE
spring I-DATE
and O
the O
strength O
of O
a O
tiger O
, O
he O
rushed O
toward O
Henry B-GPE
, O
and O
a O
knife O
which O
he O
had O
|
     | O
plucked O
from O
his O
sleeve O
, O
gleamed O
like O
lightning O
in O
the O
air O
, O
when O
suddenly O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
placed O
|
     | O
himself O
so O
as O
to O
intercept O
the O
madman O
's O
career O
, O
and O
fixed O
upon O
him O
his O
commanding O
eye O
, O
with O
a O

     | O
look O
of O
calm O
, O
stern O
, O
and O
lofty O
composure O
, O
while O
Henry B-PERSON
vainly O
strove O
to O
advance O
before O
him O
, O
and O
|
     | O
Marion O
, O
with O
frantic O
vehemence O
, O
called O
for O
help O
. O

" O

my O
life O

if O
you O

you O

you O
kindness O

no O

out O

you O

replied O
the O
maniac O
, O
in O
accents O
of O
vehement O
horror O
, O
yet O
still O

     | O
fastening O
his O
glaring O
eyes O
on O
Henry B-GPE

with O
looks O
of O
deadly O
malignity O

Having O
said O
these O
words O

with O
gestures O
of O
outrageous O
madness O

he O
bounded O
towards O
the O
door O

the O
frantic O

not O

something O

appalling O
in O
the O
stealthy O

mysterious O

death O

Every O
man O
should O
be O
considered O
accountable O
to O
Providence B-GPE
, O
not O
only O
for O
diffusing O
as O
much O
|
     | O
enjoyment O
around O
him O
as O
he O
possibly O
can O
, O
but O
also O
for O
being O
as O
happy O
himself O
as O
is O
consistent O
|
     | O
with O
the O
many O
gifts O
bestowed O
on O
him O
individually O
  O
and O
it O
is O
a O
duty O
to O
look O
back O
with O
|
     | O
self O
- O
reproach O
on O
any B-TIME
hour I-TIME
of O
existence O
, O
which O
, O
on O
account O
of O
our O
ill O
temper O
or O
discontent O
, O
has O
|
     | O
been O
less O
enjoyed O
by O
ourselves O
or O
by O
another O
, O
than O
it O
might O
have O
been O
  O
yet O
it O
is O
an O
obvious O
|
     | O
truth O
, O
that O
all O
men O
might O
be O
happier O
than O
they O
are O
, O
if O
mankind O
would O
but O
make O
the O
best O
of O
life O
|
     | O
for O
themselves O
and O
others O
. O
Never O
had O
this O
remark O
appeared O
so O
undeniable O
to O
Marion B-ORG
as O
now O
, O
in O
|
     | O
the O
case O
of O
Agnes B-LOC
, O
who O
alienated O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
more O
and O
more O
by O
her O
peevishness O
, O
though O
the O
|
     | O
arrows O
of O
her O
satire O
had O
more O
poison O
than O
point O
in O
them O
, O
and O
he O
was O
always O
ready O
enough O
to O
|
     | O
enter O
on O
a O
skirmish O
in O
the O
diamond O
- O
cut O

style O
of O
conversation O
, O
while O
it O
often O
blistered O

     | O
the O
very O
heart O
of O
their O
gentle O
sister O
, O
to O
hear O
the O
bitter O
taunting O
remarks O
and O
repartees O
which O
|
     | O
they O
levelled O
at O
each O
other O

One B-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
Agnes B-LOC
, O
in O
a O
magnificent O
fit O
of O
ill O
- O
humor O
, O
had O
seated O
herself O
at O
that O
universal O
|
     | O
refuge O
for O
idleness O
and O
discontent O
, O
an O
open O
window O
, O
complaining O
that O
the O
dulness O
of O
Edinburgh B-GPE
|
     | O
was O
quite O
maddening O
  O
while O
it O
became O
evident O
that O
the O
needle O
of O
her O
temper O
pointed O
in O
the O
most O
|
     | O
stormy O
direction O
. O
It O
was O
a O
favorite O
doctrine O
with O
Agnes B-LOC
, O
that O

that O
those O
who O
never O
suffered O
from O
it O
were O
like O

On O
the O
present O
occasion O
, O
therefore O
, O
she O
was O

     | O
relieving O
the O
intolerable O
tedium O
which O
oppressed O
her O
, O
by O
delivering O
her O
opinion O
to O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
, O

     | O
in O
no O

on O
the O
unutterable O
cruelty O

was O
going O
soon O
to O
amuse O
himself O
abroad O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
seemed O
inflated O
with O
ill O
- O
humor O
, O
like O
a O
spider O
, O
bursting O
with O
its O
own O
poison O
, O
and O
her O

     | O
countenance O
had O
assumed O
not O
the O
most O
amiable O
expression O
in O
the O
world O
, O
while O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON

     | O
snatched O
up O
a O
newspaper O

he O
began O
intently O
reading O
upside O
down O

Having O
successfully O

     | O
distinctly O
proved O
that O

and O
her O

being O
apparently O
on O
the O
point O
of O
falling O
asleep O
before O
her O
face O
, O
Agnes B-LOC
|
     | O
suddenly O
rose O
from O
her O
seat O
, O
with O
an O
exclamation O
of O
annoyance O

Sir O

crumpling O
up O
his O

approaching O

When O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
entered O
the O
room O

there O
was O
a O
look O
of O
unwonted O
care O
in O
his O
fine O

silently O

delight O
sparkling O

dimpling O
in O
her O

led O
him O
to O
a O
chair O

on O
which O

     | O
he O
sat O
down O
for O
some O
moments O
without O
speaking O

apparently O
fatigued O

agitated O
, O
while O
she O

filled O
up O
the O
pause O

by O
taking O
his O
hat O

placing O
her O

his O

rather O

     | O
your O

added O
Agnes B-LOC
, O
who O
allowed O
Marion B-PERSON
her O
own O
way O

the O
Vicar O
of O

     | O
daughters O
were O

was O
never O

" O
You O
go O
upon O
the O

     | O
impossible O
plan O
of O
pleasing O
everybody O

but O
remember O
the O
wise O
old O
proverb,—'Cover O

When O
Marion O
spoke O
from O
the O
heart O
to O
her O
sister O
, O
she O
was O
accustomed O
to O
find O
herself O
talking O
to O

     | O
the O
winds O
, O
therefore O
she O
now O
concluded O
the O
conversation O
with O
a O
lively O
good O

humored O
reply O
, O
and O
|
     | O
sat O
down O
to O
the O
pianoforte O
. O
Her O
music O
was O
as O
different O
as O
her O
conversation O
from O
that O
of O
Agnes B-LOC
, O

     | O
who O

little O
appreciated O
it O
, O

generally O
left O

humming O
a O
tune O
as O
soon O
as O
Marion O

her O

on O

The O
style O
of O
Agnes B-LOC
' O

was O
a O
brilliant O
bravura O
, O
which O
, O
in O
any O
public O

, O
might O

     | O
have O
commanded O

her O

soprano O
voice O
dazzled O
and O
astonished O

     | O
by O
its O
uncommon O
brilliancy O
, O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
alleged O
that O
it O
cracked O
every O

in O
the O

     | O
that O
her O

Though O
deceived O
only O
by O

she O
felt O

imposed O
upon O

in O

for O

     | O
several B-TIME

maintained O
a O
petulant O
silence O
, O
so O
very O
unlike O
her O
usual O

that O

     | O
she O
began O
, O
before O

to O
wish O

some O

  | O
Close O
beside O
the O
seat O
on O
which O
Agnes B-LOC
had O
accidentally O
placed O
herself O
, O
she O
very O
soon O
observed O
|
     | O
an O
old O
gentleman O
considerably O
past O
the O
meridian O
of O
life O
, O
who O
nevertheless O
dressed O
with O
very O
|
     | O
obvious O
pretensions O
to O
youth O
, O
wearing O
a O
fashionable O
, O
well O
- O
contrived O
wig O
, O
a O
perfectly O
startling O
|
     | O
set O
of O
teeth O
, O
and O
a O
gouty O
black O
velvet O
shoe O
. O
His O
figure O
was O
well O
built O
, O
and O
he O
had O
altogether O
a O
|
     | O
look O
of O
individual O
eccentricity O
peculiar O
to O
himself O
, O
with O
an O
air O
of O
supercilious O
haughtiness O
, O
|
     | O
which O
testified O
that O
, O
like O
Agnes B-LOC
, O
he O
thought O
himself O
too O
good O
for O
his O
company O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Who O
can O
he O
be O
? O
" O
thought O
she O
, O
finding O
his O
eye O
fixed O
upon O
herself O
with O
a O
fastidious O
look O
of O
|
     | O
connoisseurship O
, O
such O
as O
that O
with O
which O
he O
might O
have O
examined O
some O
doubtful O
copy O
of O
a O
Vandyke B-PRODUCT
|
     | O
or O
Titian B-NORP
, O
while O
an O
expression O
of O
complacent O
approbation O
gradually O
stole O
into O
his O
features O
. O
|
     | O
" O
Probably O
some O
eminent O
artist O
! O
He O
may O
perhaps O
ask O
leave O

do O
my O
picture O
for O
the O

     | O
exhibition O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
Having O
reached O
this O
conclusion O
, O
she O
was O
almost O
startled O
to O
hear O
herself O
addressed O
by O
her O
|
     | O
unknown O
neighbor O
, O
in O
a O
consequential O
, O
rather O
patronising O
voice O
, O
and O
with O
an O
air O
of O
|
     | O
unembarrassed O
distinction O
, O
while O
he O
evidently O
watched O
her O
countenance O
with O
the O
same O
look O
of O
|
     | O
criticism O
as O
before O
, O
so O
that O
she O
felt O
certain O
if O
there O
had O
been O
a O
flaw O
in O
her O
teeth O
, O
or O
a O
|
     | O
single O
hair O
disarranged O
on O
her O
head O
, O
it O
could O
not O
have O
escaped O
his O
notice O
. O
So O
fastidious O
a O
|
     | O
personage O
seemed O
almost O
worth O
the O
trouble O
of O
pleasing O
, O
and O
Agnes B-LOC
, O
after O
replying O
rather O
|
     | O
graciously O
to O
his O
first B-ORDINAL
few O
remarks O
, O
became O
exceedingly O
surprised O
to O
discover O
that O
there O
was O
a O
|
     | O
tone O
of O
well O
bred O
command O
in O
his O
dry O
, O
cynical O
manner O
, O
united O
with O
the O
most O
perfect O
polish O
, O
|
     | O
which O
both O
awed O
and O
surprised O
her O
. O
His O
assumption O
of O
superiority O
and O
importance O
seemed O
almost O
|
     | O
unconscious O
, O
but O
he O
evidently O
entertained O
not O
the O
fraction O
of O
a O
doubt O
that O
his O
conversation O
was O
|
     | O
a O
singular O
honor O
and O
an O
agreeable O
acquisition O
to O
any O
one O
on O
whom O
he O
condescended O
to O
bestow O
the O
|
     | O
slightest O
attention O
. O

" O

Agnes B-LOC
gave O
an O
undervaluing O
glance O
at O

lately O

scratches O
his O

from O
whence O

     | O
this O
unusual O
ornament O
had O
been O
derived O
, O
she O
inwardly O
resolved O
not O
to O
let O
it O
pass O
unnoticed O
, O
but O
|
     | O
warmly O
to O
remonstrate O
with O
her O
sister O
on O
the O
growing O
influence O
of O
the O
Abbe B-PERSON
, O
which O
seemed O
|
     | O
surprising O
and O
unaccountable O
, O
while O
an O
undefined O
feeling O
of O
alarm O
respecting O
the O
rapidly O
|
     | O
increasing O
intimacy O
of O
Agnes B-LOC
with O
Lord O
Doncaster O
, O
caused O
her O
to O
long O
impatiently O
for O
the O
|
     | O
arrival O
of O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
, O
as O
she O
felt O
unwilling O
to O
distress O
her O
uncle O
on O
the O
subject O
of O
Agnes B-LOC
' O
|
     | O
extraordinary O
conduct O
, O
trusting O
that O
the O
whole O
affair O
was O
a O
mere O
girlish O
whim O
— O
a O
piece O
of O
|
     | O
missyish O
coquetry O
to O
please O
Lord B-PERSON
Doncaster I-PERSON
, O
who O
in O
the O
mean O
time O
laughingly O
boasted O
that O
never O

before O
had O

made O
a O
proselyte O
so O
young O

" O
Patrick B-PERSON
, O
" O
exclaimed O
Agnes B-LOC
, O
hurrying O
into O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
's O
sitting O
- O
room O
the O
morning O
after O
her O
|
     | O
brother O
's O
arrival O
at O
the O
Granby B-LOC
, O
while O
a O
brilliant O
color O
lighted O
up O
her O
cheek O
, O
and O
her O
eyes O
|
     | O
sparkled O
with O
animation O
, O
" O
Lord O
Wigton B-PERSON
is O
coming O
in O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
to O
hear O
me O
sing O
that O
new O
song O
|
     | O
of O
Bellini O
's O
, O
therefore O
pray O
tell O
the O
waiters O
we O
are O
not O
at O
home O
to O
any O
living O
mortal O
, O
and O
do O

     | O
hold O
this O
music O
till O
I O
give O
a O
last O
touch O
to O
my O
ringlets O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Agnes B-LOC
impatiently O
held O
out O
a O
large O
roll O
of O
paper O
, O
but O
almost O
screamed O
with O
astonishment O
on O
|
     | O
looking O
up O
, O
to O
perceive O
that O
she O
had O
addressed O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
, O
evidently O
that O
moment O
|
     | O
arrived O
from O
a O
long O
journey O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Good O
morning O
, O
Miss O
Dunbar B-PERSON
. O
We O
are O
well O
met O
! O
" O
said O
he O
, O
with O
rather O
satirical O
emphasis O
. O
" O
I O
am O
|
     | O
in O
a O
very O
cut O
- O
throat O
humor O
to O
- O
day O
, O
and O
shall O
certainly O
put O
an O
end O
to O
little O
Lord O
Wigton O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
You O
have O
nearly O
put O
an O
end O
to O
me O
, O
" O
replied O
Agnes B-LOC
, O
unable O
to O
steady O
her O
voice O
  O
" O
but O
I O
am O
|
     | O
rather O
glad O
to O
see O
you O
! O
Perhaps O
you O
may O
be O
allowed O
to O
remain O
here O
, O
though O
that O
tiresome O
man O
|
     | O
does O
so O
teaze O
me O
about O
singing O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Wigton B-PERSON
told O
me O
he O
was O
coming O
to O
see O
, O
or O
rather O
to O
hear O
Marion B-ORG
! O
" O
said O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
, O
emerging O
|
     | O
from O
a O
distant O
window O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
To O
hear O
me O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
Marion B-PERSON
, O
with O
unfeigned O
surprise O
and O
perplexity O
, O
while O
thunder O
and O
|
     | O
lightning O
both O
lowered O
on O
the O
forehead O
of O
her O
sister O
. O
" O
That O
must O
be O
a O
mistake O
! O
I O
heard O
nothing O
|
     | O
of O
any O
appointment O
, O
and O
have O
not O
had O
a O
minute O
's O
conversation O
with O
Lord O
Wigton B-PERSON
since O
we O
arrived O
|
     | O
at O
Harrowgate B-ORG
. O
He O
heard O
me O
only O
once O
by O
accident O
, O
and O
probably O
never O
will O
again O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Unless O
by O
design O
! O
" O
whispered O
Agnes B-LOC
, O
angrily O
. O
" O
Marion O
, O
you O
have O
certainly O
some O
underhand O
way O
|
     | O
of O
getting O
on O
with O
people O
, O
which O
baffles O
my O
comprehension O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
Marion B-ORG
turned O
away O
, O
and O
silently O
resumed O
her O
place O
beside O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
been O
amusing O
|
     | O
himself O
by O
standing O
at O
the O
window O
, O
while O
she O
told O
him O
what O
carriages O
came O
round O
to O
the O
door O
, O
|
     | O
what O
parties O
of O
pleasure O
were O
setting O
out O
or O
returning O
, O
and O
what O
travelling O
equipages O
appeared O
|
     | O
in O
sight O
, O
of O
which O
seldom O
fewer B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
ten I-CARDINAL
or O
twelve B-CARDINAL
arrived O
in O
a B-DATE
day I-DATE
  O
and O
by O
ascertaining O
the O
|
     | O
coat O
- O
of O
- O
arms O
or O
coronets O
emblazoned O
on O
the O
panels O
, O
she O
sometimes O
formed O
a O
tolerable O
accurate O
|
     | O
guess O
who O
might O
probably O
be O
their O
occupants O
. O
After O
talking O
together O
with O
great O
vivacity O
for O
|
     | O
some O
time O
, O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
suddenly O
felt O
the O
arm O
of O
Marion B-PERSON
on O
which O
he O
was O
leaning O
, O
give O
an O
almost O
|
     | O
convulsive O
start O
, O
while O
she O
seemed O
with O
difficulty O
to O
suppress O
a O
half B-CARDINAL
- O
uttered O
exclamation O
of O
|
     | O
delighted O
astonishment O
. O
She O
now O
leaned O
eagerly O
out O
of O
the O
window O
, O
to O
examine O
a O
travelling O
|
     | O
chariot O
which O
had O
driven O
up O
to O
the O
door O
, O
from O
whence O
a O
lady O
, O
apparently O
in O
the O
utmost O
extreme O
|
     | O
of O
weakness O
, O
was O
carefully O
supported O
out O
by O
a O
gentleman O
, O
and O
before O
another O
moment O
could O
|
     | O
elapse O
, O
Marion B-ORG
had O
rushed O
down O
stairs O
, O
and O
was O
clasped O
in O
the O
arms O
of O
Clara B-PERSON
Granville I-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Did O
you O
get O
my O
letter O
? O
" O
exclaimed O
her O
friend O
, O
in O
feeble O
and O
agitated O
accents O
, O
while O
, O
after O
|
     | O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
rapturous O
greetings O
, O
they O
had O
retired O
alone O
into O
a O
sitting O
- O
room O
. O
" O
No O
! O
is O
that O
|
     | O
possible O
? O
How O
could O
the O
post O
have O
been O
so O
long O
delayed O
? O
But O
perhaps O
it O
may O
be O
as O
well O
, O
for O
|
     | O
there O
was O
grief O
as O
much O
as O
joy O
in O
it O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Marion O
observed O
now O
with O
alarm O
, O
that O
the O
appearance O
of O
Clara B-GPE
, O
always O
interesting O
, O
had O
become O
|
     | O
almost O
painfully O
so O
. O
The O
summer B-DATE
bloom O
had O
entirely O
vanished O
from O
her O
face O
, O
and O
not O
only O
had O
her O
|
     | O
form O
shrunk O
, O
but O
there O
was O
a O
deep O
and O
settled O
sadness O
in O
the O
expression O
of O
her O
eye O
, O
when O
she O
|
     | O
added O
, O
| 
  | O
" O
The O
doctors O
have O
ordered O
me O
to O
go O
by O
easy O
stages O
abroad O

they O
recommended O
me O
first B-ORDINAL
to O

     | O
try O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
weeks I-DATE

sight O
of O

will O
do O
me O
more O
good O
than O
any O
medicine O

I O
had O
little O

     | O
difficulty O

very O
little O
indeed O
, O
Marion B-PERSON
— O
in O
persuading O
Richard B-PERSON

take O
the O
Granby O

way O
to O

     | O
the O
south O
of O

hunting O

the O

approaching O
winter B-DATE

must O
see O
now O

do O

as O
everybody O
does O
, O
except O
my O
dear O

brother O
himself O
, O
that O

hastening O

" O
| 
  | O
A O
start O
of O
indescribable O
emotion O
now O
shot O
through O
the O
heart O
of O
Marion B-ORG

for O
in O
the O
pallid O

     | O
emaciated O

Clara B-GPE
, O

already O
read O
a O
sentence O
of O

she O
gazed O
upon O
her O

     | O
friend O
with O
a O
growing O
conviction O
, O
which O
filled O
her O
heart O
with O
anguish O

that O
soon O

Miss B-PERSON

, O
observing O
her O

you O

egotism O

If O
he O

any O

the O

not O
utterly O
hate O

day O

     | O
after O

schooled O

unjustifiably O
her O
own O
best O

hopes O

peace O

the O
keeping O

united O

might O

thee O

to O

the O
sacrifice O

must O
be O
rejected O

, O
day O
after O

with O
pious O
resignation O

fortitude O

endured O
the O
slow O

agonizing O
martyrdom O

extinguishing O

so O
deeply O
loved O

gratifying O

adorned O
with O
flowers O
from O

knew O

Every O
evening O
Mr. O

urged O
upon O
his O
sister O
the O
importance O

her O
being O
speedily O

     | O
conveyed O

every B-TIME

Clara B-PERSON
postponed O
their O
preparations O
, O
feeling O
too O

     | O
much O
enfeebled O
for O
the O
journey O

unwilling O

every O
day O
, O
making O
hours O

moments O

     | O
they O
conversed O
together O

Clara B-PERSON
knew O
nothing O

never O
had O
occasion O
to O
kill O
time O
, O
for O

     | O
she O
valued O
it O
as O

valued O
, O
at O
an O
inestimable O
price O
. O
She O
had O
no O
weariness O
to O
|
     | O
dissipate O
, O
as O
every B-TIME
hour I-TIME
was O
occupied O
in O
improving O
her O

herself O

Little O
of O
what O
is O
really O
going O
on O
in O

be O
traced O
on O
its O
gay O

disappointment O

Agnes B-LOC
had O
lately O
allowed O
herself O
to O
suspect O
that O
her O
|
     | O
preference O
for O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
was O
by O
no O
means O
mutual O
  O
and O
though O
it O
still O
lingered O
in O
her O
|
     | O
mind O
, O
out O
- O
living O
all O
that O
coldness O
and O
caprice O
which O
had O
superseded O
the O
persevering O
ardor O
with O
|
     | O
which O
he O
once O
endeavored O
to O
engross O
her O
attention O
, O
the O
indignation O
of O
her O
feelings O
drove O
her O
|
     | O
now O
to O
seek O
relief O
in O
any O
counter O
- O
irritation O
, O
and O
especially O
in O
cultivating O
, O
beside O
Lord O
|
     | O
Doncaster O
, O
the O
society O
where O
he O
was O
most O
depreciated O
, O
and O
where O
she O
heard O
many O
a O
story O
of O
him O
|
     | O
from O
the O
Abbe B-PERSON
, O
which O
filled O
her O
with O
angry O
misgivings O
. O
| 
  | O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
now O
perceived O
, O
with O
almost O
bewildered O
astonishment O
, O
that O
the O
beautiful O
|
     | O
Agnes B-LOC
remained O
stationary O
the O
whole O
evening O
with O
Lord O
Doncaster O
, O
wishing O
, O
he O
conjectured O
, O
to O
|
     | O
propitiate O
the O
uncle O
as O
a O
preliminary O
to O
securing O
the O
nephew O
, O
and O
that O
she O
actually O
made O
him O
a O
|
     | O
secondary O
object O
in O
society O
, O
while O
it O
was O
evident O
the O
Marquis B-PERSON
observed O
and O
enjoyed O
this O
very O
|
     | O
visible O
alteration O
. O
It O
became O
particularly O
conspicuous O
at O
last O
, O
when O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
|
     | O
having O
spoken O
, O
one B-TIME
evening I-TIME
, O
a O
few O
words O
to O
Agnes B-LOC
, O
strolled O
away O
in O
momentary O
pique O
at O
the O
|
     | O
careless O
inattention O
of O
her O
reply O
, O
after O
which O
the O
vacant O
chair O
, O
beside O
her O
and O
Lord B-PERSON
Doncaster I-PERSON
, O
|
     | O
was O
immediately O
occupied O
by O
the O
Abbe B-PERSON
, O
who O
talked O
down O
both O
his O
companions O
, O
while O
a O
long O
|
     | O
discussion O
ensued O
, O
of O
evidently O
deepening O
interest O
, O
during O
which O
the O
eyes O
of O
all O
three B-CARDINAL
were O
|
     | O
frequently O
directed O
towards O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
. O
Those O
of O
Agnes B-LOC
now O
assumed O
an O
almost O
|
     | O
unnatural O
brightness O
, O
and O
her O
cheek O
became O
dyed O
with O
a O
hectic O
flush O
of O
excitement O
. O
Then O
, O
for O
|
     | O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
, O
he O
perceived O
the O
gold O
crucifix O
which O
she O
held O
carelessly O
in O
her O
hand O
, O
while O
the O
|
     | O
Abbe O
spoke O
with O
an O
air O
of O
artful O
and O
subdued O
earnestness O
, O
and O
Lord B-PERSON
Doncaster I-PERSON
, O
looking O
like O
|
     | O
winter O
beside O
spring O
, O
watched O
, O
with O
evident O
admiration O
, O
the O
changes O
of O
color O
and O
expression O
|
     | O
which O
flitted O
like O
an O
aurora O
borealis O
on O
her O
beautiful O
features O
. O
It O
occurred O
to O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
|
     | I-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
, O
that O
his O
uncle O
, O
believing O
, O
perhaps O
, O
in O
some O
degree O
, O
the O
report O
of O
his O
marriage O
to O
|
     | O
Agnes B-LOC
, O
and O
being O
an O
enthusiastic O
admirer O
of O
beauty O
, O
might O
wish O
the O
Abbe B-PERSON
first B-ORDINAL
to O
convert O
the O
|
     | O
young O
lady O
to O
his O
own O
faith O
, O
before O
bestowing O
him O
upon O
her O
, O
and O
as O
the O
idea O
flitted O
through O
his O
|
     | O
mind O
, O
he O
smiled O
inwardly O
to O
think O
how O
they O
would O
all O
be O
disappointed O
. O
Still O
the O
ceaseless O
|
     | O
conversation O
continued O
, O
and O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON

apprehending O

Agnes B-LOC

almost O
to O

from O
a O
dream O
at O
these O

, O
after O
a O

perplexity O
, O
during O
which O

assumed O
an O

, O
Lord O

having O

     | O
turned O
away O
to O
converse O
with O
Mrs. O
O'Donoghoe B-PERSON

she O
slowly O
rose O
, O
and O
silently O
took O
her O
place O
in O

     | O
the O

. O
| 
  | O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
had O
hitherto O
been O
to O
Agnes B-LOC
like O
the O
sun O
to O
the O
dial O
, O
causing O
the O
lights O

     | O

of O
joy O

to O
flit O
over O
her O
countenance O
according O
to O
his O
own O
pleasure O
, O
but O
|
     | O
now O
he O
became O
piqued O

astonished O
to O
perceive O
that O
he O
could O
not O
even O
command O
her O
most O

     | O
transient O
attention O
, O
and O
with O
a O
satirical O
glance O
at O
her O
absent O
countenance O
, O
he O
emphatically O

     | O
exclaimed O

" O

mechanically O

" O

observing O
with O
increased O

the O

" O

the O
consumption O
of O
their O

     | O
muffin O

first O
cup O

when O
a O
very O
plainly O
dressed O
young O
lady O
glided O
into O
the O
room O

a O

     | O
timid O

agitated O
step O
, O

giving O
a O
slight O
nod O
to O
the O
party O

silently O
seated O
herself O
beside O

Marion O
, O
who O
, O
in O
compassion O
to O
her O
apparent O
shyness O
, O
averted O
her O
eyes O
. O
She O
seemed O
recently O

     | O
recovered O
from O
an O
illness O
, O
being O
thin O
and O
emaciated O
to O
excess O
, O
while O
it O
appeared O
as O
if O
her O
hair O

     | O
had O
been O
entirely O
shaved O
off O
, O
as O
she O
wore O
a O
cap O
fitting O
close O
to O
her O
face O
, O
and O
neither O
curl O

vary O
the O
almost O
spectral O
whiteness O
of O
her O
whole O
aspect O
. O
Marion O
ventured O
a O
second B-ORDINAL
|
     | O
glance O
at O
the O
interesting O
invalid O
, O
and O
observed O
a O
smile O
quivering O
about O
her O
mouth O
, O
which O
she O
|
     | O
seemed O
vainly O
endeavoring O
to O
suppress O
, O
and O
a O
sly O
glance O
towards O
herself O
, O
which O
enlightened O
her O

     | O
in O
a O
moment O
, O
for O
, O
with O
an O
exclamation O
of O
joy O
, O
she O
sprang O
from O
her O
seat O
and O
was O
instantly O

     | O
embraced O
, O
with O
laughing O
delight O
, O
by O
her O
old O
friend O
Caroline B-PERSON

the O

     | O
Abbe B-PERSON

it O

last O

Lord O

sixteen B-DATE
years I-DATE

tottering O

It O

     | O
became O

that O
the O

" O

" O
to O
remember O
the O
large O

curious O
mosaic O

the O

uninhabited O

I O
was O

are O
always O

     | O
in O
bad O

it O
was O
supposed O

strong O
reasons O

his O

     | O

The O
drawing O

was O
like O
a O
lantern O
with O
windows O
on O
every O
side O
, O
the O
floor O
so O

     | O
polished O
that O
it O
might O
have O
taken O
fire O
from O
the O
perpetual O
friction O
, O
and O
a O
scanty O
Turkish B-NORP
carpet O

     | O
served O

to O
cover O
half B-CARDINAL
the O
slippery O
floor O

" O

" O
I O
always O

continued O
Mr. O

, O
smiling O
. O
" O
But O
pathways O

laid O
along O

in O
every O
possible O

where O
it O

A O

bright O

elderly O

processions O

whom O
might O

observed O
drinking O
tuns O

in O
order O
that O
complexions O
evidently O
much O
the O

repaired O

till O
they O
looked O
as O

     | O
good O
as O
new O
  O
and O
though O
the O
Admiral B-ORG
complained O
that O
, O
to O
his O
uncomfortable O
feelings O
, O
it O
always O
|
     | O
seemed O
as O
if O
he O
had O
swallowed O
the O
tumbler O
itself O
, O
yet O
he O
valiantly O
persevered O
in O
daily B-DATE
drinking O

     | O
bumpers O
to O
his O
own O
health O
, O
saying O
that O
what O
was O
good O
for O
so O
many O
others O
, O
would O
be O
good O
for O
his O

     | O
complaint O
, O

Sir O

For O
nearly B-TIME
an I-TIME

he O
sauntered O
on O

the O
Granby B-LOC

exchanging O
gay O

observations O
with O
those O

passed O

listening O
with O
a O
satirical O
smile O
to O
Lord O
Wigton B-PERSON

who O

the O

, O
closely O
buttoned O
up O
in O
a O

military O
surtout O

with O
his O

up O

down O

close O

with O
his O
eye O
fixed O
upon O
the O

making O
apparently O
so O
accurate O
a O
survey O
of O
those O
private O

that O
had O
it O
been O
by O

     | O
night O
instead O
of O
by O
day O

he O
might O
almost O
have O
been O
arrested O
on O
suspicion O
of O
intending O

     | O
attempt O
a O
burglarious O
entrance O

  | O
Not O
a O

seemed O
stirring O
within O

all O
drawn O
down O

the O

all O
closed O

still O
the O
stranger O
paced O
rapidly O
up O

down O

casting O
many O
impatient O
, O
irritable O

     | O
glances O
upwards O
on O
the O
silent O
walls O

yet O
keeping O
himself O
so O
concealed O
that O
no O
one O
, O
looking O

     | O
suddenly O
out O
, O
could O
have O
perceived O
him O
lurking O
there O

Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
now O
, O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
, O

     | O
suspected O
that O
he O
did O
not O
belong O
to O
the O
party O
within O
, O
and O
became O
more O

more O
interested O
in O

     | O
observing O
his O
various O
eccentric O
movements O

which O
betrayed O
a O
high O
state O
of O
excitement O
, O
till O
at O

     | O
length O
, O
finding O
himself O
watched O
, O
with O
the O
quickness O
of O
lightning O
he O
suddenly O
vanished O
round O
a O

     | O
projecting O
corner O
of O
the O
building O
, O
though O
a O
few O
moments O
afterwards O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
perceived O
that O

     | O
he O
was O
concealed O
in O
a O
thicket O
of O
trees O
not O
far O
off O
, O
where O
he O
could O
still O
keep O
his O
eye O
fastened O

     | O
on O
the O
windows O
with O
unswerving O
steadiness O
. O

Parties O

hurried O
onwards O

with O
their O

of O
water O

all O
very O
|
     | O
loudly O
expressing O
their O
astonishment O
that O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
had O
not O
yet O
set O
forth O
to O
hear O
the O

     | O
military O
band O

which O
was O
reported O
to O
be O
playing O
" O
beautifully O

enchantingly O
! O
or O
detestably O
! O
" O

     | O
according O
to O
the O
humor O
of O
those O
who O
spoke O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
crowd O
was O
on O
this B-DATE
day I-DATE
so O
excessive O
, O
that O
the O
old O
well O
had O
been O
completely O
exhausted O
, O
and O
|
     | O
alarming O
apprehensions O
were O
entertained O
by O
the O
invalids O
, O
of O
a O
scarcity O
for O
the O
later O
visitors O
, O
|
     | O
but O
still O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
stirred O
not O
! O
Though O
not O
usually O
endowed O
with O
excessive O
interest O
in O
any O
|
     | O
affairs O
but O
his O
own O
, O
the O
movements O
of O
the O
mysterious O
stranger O
, O
and O
his O
look O
of O
feverish O
|
     | O
anxiety O
, O
engrossed O
almost O
the O
whole O
of O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
's O
thoughts O
, O
though O
, O
to O
avoid O
any O
appearance O
|
     | O
of O
espionage O
, O
he O
kept O
up O
a O
lively O
dialogue O
with O
Mrs. O
O'Donoghoe B-PERSON
and O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
Marion O
in O
the O
mean O
time O
had O
been O
exceedingly O
amused O
by O
the O
scene O
which O
usually O
takes O
place O
at O
|
     | O
the O
well O
, O
where O
every O
face O
seemed O
as O
if O
laboring O
under O
the O
nausea O
of O
sea O
- O
sickness O
, O
and O
she O
|
     | O
stood O
for O
some O
time O
with O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
and O
Mr. O
Granville B-PERSON
, O
laughingly O
studying O
physiognomy O
, O
as O
|
     | O
parties O
arrived O
in O
rapid O
succession O
, O
threw O
off O
a O
tumbler O
of O
smoking O
horrors O
, O
and O
instantly O
|
     | O
departed O
, O
while O
a O
row O
of O
shabbily O
- O
dressed O
women O
, O
standing O
behind O
a O
stone O
counter O
, O
hurriedly O
|
     | O
filled O
the O
glasses O
, O
and O
handed O
them O
over O
in O
a O
long O
wooden O
ladle O
, O
to O
the O
expectant O
invalids O
, O
one B-CARDINAL
|
     | O
by O
one O
, O
who O
were O
waiting O
patiently O
or O
impatiently O
for O
their O
turn O
. O
Each O
of O
the O
great O
hotels O
had O
|
     | O
an O
emissary O
appointed O
here O
, O
whose O
business O
it O
was O
to O
attend O
on O
their O
respective O
guests O
with O
the O
|
     | O
proper O
allowance O
of O
water O
, O
and O
it O
seemed O
as O
if O
these O
old O
women O
knew O
by O
a O
sort O
of O
instinct O
those O
|
     | O
who O
belonged O
to O
their O
own O
house O
  O
but O
an O
angry O
contest O
having O
taken O
place O
respecting O
one B-CARDINAL
|
     | O
gentleman O
, O
who O
was O
obliged O
to O
wait O
with O
resignation O
or O
without O
it O
, O
till O
the O
belligerent O
parties O
|
     | O
had O
decided O
whose O
privilege O
it O
was O
to O
kill O
or O
cure O
him O
, O
Marion B-ORG
's O
attention O
was O
more O
peculiarly O
|
     | O
attracted O
to O
the O
spot O
, O
where O
one O
of O
the O
women O
who O
assisted O
in O
serving O
out O
the O
general O
beverage O
|
     | O
had O
been O
hitherto O
screened O
from O
her O
notice O
. O
Her O
face O
was O
excessively O
muffled O
up O
, O
but O
in O
the O
|
     | O
little O
that O
remained O
visible O
, O
traces O
of O
beauty O
still O
remained O
, O
though O
her O
features O
were O
so O
|
     | O
attuned O
to O
suffering O
, O
that O
Marion B-ORG
with O
wonder O
and O
pity O
contemplated O
so O
pale O
and O
ghastly O
a O
form O
. O
|
     | O
At O
length O
a O
dim O
idea O
stole O
into O
her O
mind O
, O
that O
surely O
she O
had O
seen O
that O
face O
before O
, O
but O
while O
|
     | O
the O
floating O
remembrance O
yet O
continued O
to O
flicker O
indistinctly O
through O
her O
mind O
, O
the O
|
     | O
wretched O
- O
looking O
woman O
, O
with O
a O
startled O
glance O
, O
had O
vanished O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Patrick B-PERSON
! O
" O
whispered O
Marion B-ORG
, O
turning O
to O
take O
her O
brother O
's O
arm O
, O
" O
do O
patronize O
me O
for O
one B-TIME
|
     | I-TIME
minute I-TIME
! O
Did O
you O
observe O
that O
melancholy O
- O
looking O
woman O
at O
the O
well O
? O
I O
never O
saw O
so O
blighted O
a O
|
     | O
countenance O
! O
What O
can O
the O
sorrows O
be O
that O
stamped O
such O
a O
look O
of O
ghastly O
woe O
upon O
these O
|
     | O
beautiful O
features O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
Marion O
looked O
up O
for O
a O
reply O
, O
and O
started O
to O
find O
that O
she O
had O
inadvertently O
taken O
the O
arm O
of O
|
     | O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
, O
whose O
usual O
vivacity O
and O
presence O
of O
mind O
seemed O
at O
this O
moment O
to O
have O
|
     | O
entirely O
forsaken O
him O
. O
His O
eyes O
were O
straining O
after O
the O
receding O
figure O
of O
the O
stranger O
, O
with O
|
     | O
an O
air O
of O
eager O
astonishment O
and O
alarm O
, O
while O
his O
countenance O
had O
become O
white O
as O
death O
. O
In O
a O
|
     | O
moment O
, O
however O
, O
he O
recovered O
himself O
, O
when O
Marion B-PERSON
, O
with O
an O
exclamation O
of O
surprise O
, O
had O
drawn O
|
     | O
away O
her O
hand O
, O
making O
a O
hurried O
apology O
for O
her O
mistake O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Did O
you O
not O
recognise O
her O
? O
" O
asked O
he O
, O
in O
accents O
of O
almost O
tremulous O
agitation O
. O
" O
It O
could O
be O
|
     | O
no O
one O
else O
! O
Surely O
that O
must O
have O
been O
— O
Dixon B-PERSON
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
It O
was O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
Marion B-PERSON
, O
breathlessly O
. O
" O
How O
has O
she O
come O
here O
? O
what O
can O
she O
want O
? O
where O
is O
|
     | O
Agnes B-LOC
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
This O
must O
be O
inquired O
into O
! O
" O
muttered O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
, O
almost O
inaudibly O
  O
and O
then O
|
     | O
resuming O
his O
usual O
careless O
vivacity O
of O
tone O
and O
manner O
, O
he O
entreated O
Marion B-PERSON
to O
let O
him O
benefit O
|
     | O
by O
the O
fortunate O
resemblance O
of O
his O
dress O
to O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
's O
, O
and O
still O
continue O
to O
escort O
her O
. O
|
     | O
" O
I O
envy O
Dunbar O
for O
the O
privilege O
whenever O
he O
enjoys O
it O
, O
for O
you O
shun O
me O
like O
a O
rattle O
- O
snake O
, O
" O
|
     | O
added O
he O
, O
in O
his O
most O
insinuating O
tone O
  O
" O
yet O
I O
would O
not O
for O
worlds O
be O
your O
brother O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
It O
is O
but O
a O
troublesome O
office O
, O
" O
replied O
Marion B-PERSON
, O
looking O
anxiously O
round O
for O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
, O
who O
|
     | O
had O
walked O
on O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
before O
, O
leaning O
on O
Mr. O
Granville B-PERSON
, O
and O
most O
impatiently O
did O
she O
long O
|
     | O
for O
their O
return O
, O
being O
always O
on O
the O
alert O
to O
shun O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
without O
appearing O
to O
|
     | O
do O
so O
. O
Though O
, O
like O
all O
other O
persons O
, O
amused O
and O
enlivened O
by O
his O
whimsical O
and O
diverting O
|
     | O
style O
of O
conversation O
, O
which O
had O
more O
even O
in O
the O
manner O
than O
in O
the O
words O
, O
and O
though O
with O
any O
|
     | O
friend O
of O
her O
brother O
's O
it O
pained O
her O
courteous O
nature O
to O
be O
otherwise O
than O
frank O
and O
good O
|
     | O
humored O
, O
yet O
she O
made O
a O
principle O
of O
unobtrusively O
evading O
his O
assiduities O
, O
not O
only O
because O
|
     | O
his O
conduct O
to O
Agnes B-LOC
had O
been O
and O
still O
continued O
unpardonably O
dishonorable O
, O
but O
she O
felt O
|
     | O
indignant O
to O
think O
that O
he O
was O
disposed O
to O
beguile O
his O
leisure O
by O
also O
captivating O
and O
deluding O
|
     | O
herself O
. O
It O
was O
obvious O
that O
whenever O
she O
entered O
the O
room O
, O
he O
became O
silent O
and O
embarrassed O
|
     | O
with O
every O
one O
else O
, O
and O
took O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
opportunity O
of O
devoting O
himself O
exclusively O
to O
her O
. O
Not O
|
     | O
giving O
one O
shadow O
of O
belief O
to O
all O
his O
professions O
, O
when O
Marion B-PERSON
was O
obliged O
to O
listen O
, O
she O
did O
|
     | O
so O
with O
unconcealed O
indignation O
on O
finding O
the O
same O
insinuations O
of O
attachment O
made O
to O
herself O
|
     | O
which O
had O
been O
repeated O
to O
her O
formerly O
with O
triumphant O
credulity O
by O
Agnes B-LOC
. O
Marion O
thoroughly O
|
     | O
despised O
his O
double O
dealing O
and O
ungenerous O
trifling O
, O
while O
feeling O
nothing O
for O
him O
on O
that O
|
     | O
score O
but O
contempt O
, O
she O
could O
almost O
have O
rejoiced O
that O
he O
wasted O
his O
efforts O
to O
be O
|
     | O
irresistible O
on O
one O
who O
, O
being O
so O
fully O
aware O
of O
his O
character O
, O
could O
incur O
no O
danger O
from O
the O
|
     | O
fascinations O
which O
had O
been O
fatal O
to O
the O
peace O
of O
many O
. O
Safe O
in O
the O
consciousness O
of O
a O
hallowed O
|
     | O
attachment O
to O
Mr. O
Granville B-PERSON
, O
and O
convinced O
that O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
was O
incapable O
of O
a O
single O
|
     | O
genuine O
feeling O
, O
she O
could O
scarcely O
have O
considered O
it O
necessary O
even O
to O
be O
repulsive O
in O
her O
|
     | O
manner O
  O
but O
it O
seemed O
due O
to O
Agnes B-LOC
as O
much O
as O
possible O
to O
avoid O
him O
, O
knowing O
that O
her O
sister O
|
     | O
had O
not O
yet O
been O
able O
entirely O
to O
divest O
herself O
of O
a O
lingering O
belief O
that O
the O
professions O
|
     | O
which O
were O
false O
to O
all O
others O
were O
sincere O
to O
herself O
. O
| 
  | O
For O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
in O
his O
whole O
acquaintance O
with O
lady O
- O
kind O
, O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
felt O
|
     | O
doubtful O
and O
diffident O
of O
his O
own O
fascinations O
, O
and O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
also O
he O
felt O
himself O
|
     | O
really O
and O
undeniably O
in O
love O
, O
as O
the O
transparent O
single O
- O
hearted O
excellence O
of O
Marion B-ORG
's O
|
     | O
character O
seemed O
, O
when O
compared O
with O
the O
hackneyed O
and O
artificial O
mind O
of O
her O
sister O
, O
and O
all O
|
     | O
other O
girls O
, O
like O
the O
difference O
between O
a O
pure O
mountain O
breeze O
and O
a O
London B-GPE
fog O
. O
The O
|
     | O
attachment O
he O
so O
often O
affected O
had O
now O
become O
genuine O
, O

the O
feelings O
he O
formerly O
invented O

     | O
for O
amusement O
, O
and O
expressed O
with O
the O
utmost O
fluency O
, O
were O
now O
so O
real O
, O
that O
they O
could O
|
     | O
scarcely O
be O
spoken O
at O
all O
  O
for O
language O
seemed O
to O
fail O
him O
when O
he O
addressed O
Marion B-ORG
, O
and O
every B-DATE

     | I-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
as O
it O
increased O
his O
attachment O
, O
diminished O
his O
hope O
. O
She O
had O
no O
vulgar O
love O
of O
admiration O
  O

     | O
and O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
was O
mortified O
to O
perceive O

that O

the O

her O
cheek O

at O
the O

all O

parade O

hide O
her O
confusion O

Marion B-PERSON
placed O
her O

the O

     | O
shoulder O
of O
Agnes B-LOC
for O
some O
moments O

leaned O
forward O

examining O
those O
splendid O
paintings O
, O
the O

     | O
singular O
beauty O
of O
which O
she O
admired O
, O
while O
expressing O
considerable O
amazement O
at O
the O
strange O
, O

     | O
distorted O
designs O

animals O
with O

It O
can O
be O

" O
replied O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
|
     | O
soothing O
tone O
  O
for O
he O
thought O
she O
must O
certainly O
be O
deranged O
. O
" O
There O
he O
waits O
for O
us O
! O
We O
shall O

     | O
overtake O
our O
friends O
immediately O

" O

" O
Look O
at O
this O
tree!—pretend O
to O
be O
admiring O
the O
landscape O
! O
" O
continued O
the O
young O
lady O
, O
in O
a O
|
     | O
deep O
, O
concentrated O
voice O
  O
" O
but O
tell O
me,—can O
we O
make O
our O
escape O
unobserved O
by O
that O
man O
? O
My O
life O
, O
|
     | O
probably O
, O
depends O
upon O
your O
answer O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
now O
became O
confirmed O
in O
his O
opinion O
respecting O
the O
insanity O
of O
his O
young O
|
     | O
companion O
, O
and O
fixing O
his O
eyes O
on O
her O
countenance O
, O
he O
perceived O
with O
amazement O
that O
every O
tinge O
|
     | O
of O
color O
had O
been O
drained O
from O
her O
cheek O
— O
that O
her O
lip O
quivered O
with O
fright O
, O
and O
that O
terror O
|
     | O
spoke O
in O
her O
eyes O
, O
and O
trembled O
in O
every O
limb O
  O
while O
her O
words O
poured O
out O
with O
a O
rushing O
|
     | O
vehemence O
of O
tone O
and O
manner O
which O
startled O
and O
alarmed O
him O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
caught O
a O
momentary O
glance O
of O
his O
countenance O
! O
Where O
could O
I O
ever O
see O
these O
eyes O
and O
be O
|
     | O
mistaken O
? O
There O
is O
madness O
yet O
in O
their O
expression O
. O
He O
has O
sworn O
to O
destroy O
me O
. O
The O
whole O
|
     | O
purpose O
of O
his O
being O
is O
revenge O
! O
" O

  | O
" O
Revenge O
on O
you O
— O
impossible O
! O
Who O
could O
be O
so O
unmanly O
— O
so O
— O
— O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
You O
forget O
that O
my O
cousin O
is O
insane O
— O
that O
he O
thinks O
I O
drove O
him O
into O
madness O

that O
he O
pursued O

     | O
me O
day O

night O

we O
shut O
him O
up O

nothing O

" O

" O
Miss O
Howard B-PERSON
! O
I O
might O
have O
guessed O
this O
! O
Can O
it O
be O

When O
I O
am O
here O

you O

! O
how O
little O
you O
know O
him O
! O
In O
his O
present O
state O

he O
has O
the O
strength O
of O
ten B-CARDINAL
men O
, O
" O
replied O

     | O
she O
, O
with O
wild O
and O
hurried O
glances O
. O
" O
Once O
I O
saw O
him O
struggle O
in O
their O
grasp O

Why O
must O
I O
forever O

     | O
remember O
that O
scene O
? O
His O
cries O
, O
his O
imprecations O
  O
but O

he O
returns O

Let O
us O
appear O
still O
to O

     | O
advance O

but O
concert O
some O
plan O
for O
my O
escape O

or O
believe O
me O

my O
moments O
are O
numbered O

" O

  | O
The O
tone O
of O
intense O
agony O
in O
which O
these O
words O
were O
uttered O
, O
filled O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
with O
pity O
, O
|
     | O
while O
knowing O
the O
fearful O
and O
mysterious O
power O
communicated O
by O
madness O
, O
even O
to O
the O
feeblest O
|
     | O
frame O
, O
he O
felt O
a O
well O
- O
grounded O
apprehension O
for O
the O
terrified O
girl O
's O
safety O
, O
on O
observing O
the O
|
     | O
strong O
, O
muscular O
figure O
of O
the O
maniac O
  O
therefore O
, O
after O
walking O
on O
some O
steps O
, O
he O
whispered O
to O
|
     | O
her O
, O
almost O
inaudibly O
: O
| 
  | O
" O
The O
guide O
seldom O
looks O
back O

me O
ask O
him O
a O
question O

immediately O
afterwards O
drop O
down O

     | O
the O
side O

the O
sound O

not O

certainly O

escape O

" O
continued O
he O
, O
elevating O
his O
voice O
in O
an O
authoritative O
tone O
, O
yet O
, O
even O
at O
this O
|
     | O
crisis O
, O
unable O
to O
resist O
a O
joke O
  O
" O
tell O
me O
the O
exact O
age O

this O
tree O
, O
and O
how O
many O
stones O
it O

     | O
took O
to O
build O
the O
Abbey O

" O
| 
  | O
The O
man O
threw O
back O
some O
inaudible O
reply O
, O
in O
a O
surly O
, O
dogged O
voice O
, O
and O
quickened O
his O
pace O
|
     | O
towards O
a O
dark O
group O
of O
fir O
trees O
, O
while O
again O
the O
almost O
fainting O
girl O
gave O
an O
agitated O
glance O
|
     | O
at O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
, O
who O
silently O
pointed O
towards O
the O
turf O
edging O
along O
the O
gravel O
- O
walk O
, O
making O
her O
|
     | O
a O
sign O
to O
take O
flight O
upon O
it O
as O
noiselessly O
as O
possible O
, O
while O
he O
proceeded O
forward O
himself O
|
     | O
with O
no O
fairy O
tread O
, O
making O
the O
sound O
of O
his O
footsteps O
as O
loud O
as O
if O
there O
had O
still O
been O
two B-CARDINAL
|
     | O
behind O
. O
| 
  | O
After O
the O
terrified O
girl O
had O
hastily O
slid O
down O
a O
steep O
bank O
and O
disappeared O
amidst O
a O
mass O
of O
|
     | O
evergreens O
, O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
was O
beginning O
to O
contemplate O
the O
expediency O
of O
adopting O
a O
similar O
plan O
, O
|
     | O
seeing O
that O
in O
conflict O
with O
a O
madman O
he O
could O
gain O
neither O
honor O
or O
advantage O
, O
and O
might O
be O
|
     | O
seriously O
injured O
, O
when O
the O
maniac O
suddenly O
burst O
into O
a O
thrilling O
, O
fearful O
laugh O
, O
and O
, O
|
     | O
snatching O
a O
pistol O
from O
his O
breast O
, O
turned O
fiercely O
round O
, O
when O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
instantly O
|
     | O
recognised O
, O
as O
he O
had O
begun O
to O
expect O
, O
the O
countenance O
of O
that O
excited O
stranger O
, O
whom O
Captain O

     | O
De O
Crespigny O
had O
in O
the O
morning B-TIME
named O
to O
him O
as O
Ernest B-PERSON

. O

  | O
Astonishment O
and O
unimaginable O
fury O
glittered O
in O
the O
madman O
's O
wild O
and O
haggard O
countenance O
, O
|
     | O
when O
he O
missed O
the O
object O
of O
his O
pursuit O
, O
and O
he O
looked O
for O
the O
moment O
like O
a O
wild O
beast O
at O
|
     | O
bay O
, O
till O
, O
springing O
upon O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
with O
a O
cry O
of O
hideous O
rage O
, O
he O
seized O
hold O
of O
his O
arm O

     | O
with O
a O
delirious O
grasp O
, O
and O
clenched O
his O
fist O
, O
shouting O
in O
accents O
of O
frenzied O
rage O
, O
while O
the O

     | O
white O
foam O
was O
on O
his O

Sir O

stood O
firm O
as O
a O
rock O
before O
this O
whirlwind O
of O
passion O

though O
filled O
with O

horrible O
amazement O

heard O
the O
sharp O

shrill O

shrieking O
voice O

if O

CHAPTER B-LAW

  | O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
gave O
instant O
information O
to O
the O
civil O
authorities O
at O
Harrowgate B-ORG
, O
respecting O
the O
|
     | O
dangerous O
madman O
now O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
  O
and O
when O
every O
particular O
of O
his O
adventure O
had O
|
     | O
reached O
Agnes B-LOC
, O
she O
felt O
an O
undefined O
sensation O
of O
disappointment O
that O
the O
end O
had O
not O
been O
of O
a O
|
     | O
more O
exciting O
nature O
. O
Never O
happy O
unless O
her O
mind O
were O
in O
a O
complete O
foam O
of O
excitement O
, O
she O
|
     | O
lived O
for O
sensation O
, O
and O
would O
have O
bought O
it O
at O
any O
price O
, O
being O
heard O
often O
to O
complain O
, O
that O
|
     | O
now O
nothing O
ever O
happened O
. O
Every O
day O
she O
considered O
as O
a O
chapter O
in O
her O
own O
life O
, O
into O
which O
|
     | O
she O
wished O
as O
many O
incidents O
crowded O
as O
possible O
, O
caring O
little O
whether O
joy O
or O
sorrow O
prevailed O
|
     | O
among O
those O
around O
, O
if O
the O
weary O
vacuum O
in O
her O
thoughts O
were O
but O
filled O
up O
. O
A O
few O
elopements O
or O
|
     | O
murders O
made O
a O
newspaper O
extremely O
acceptable O
  O
while O
even O
public O
riots O
she O
would O
have O
allowed O
|
     | O
to O
a O
certain O
pitch O
, O
provided O
she O
could O
pull O
the O
check O
- O
string O
as O
soon O
as O
they O
became O
at O
all O
|
     | O
inconvenient O
or O
alarming O
to O
herself O
  O
while O
she O
often O
remarked O
, O
in O
a O
querulous O
tone O
, O
that O
a O
|
     | O
revolution O
had O
been O
a O
thing O
threatened O
and O
talked O
of O
all O
her O
life O
, O
without O
ever O
seeming O
any O

     | O
nearer O
. O
The O
world O
, O
in O
short O
, O
if O
arranged O
to O
suit O
her O
taste O
, O
would O
have O
been O

On O

Sir O

at O
his O

near O

Granby B-GPE

Marion B-ORG
accompanied O
her O

Mrs. O
O'Donoghoe B-PERSON

to O
fulfil O
a O
dinner O

     | O
engagement O
at O
the B-FAC
Crown I-FAC
Hotel I-FAC
  O
and O
on O
their O
way O
home O
, O
the O
lively O
widow O
rallied O
Agnes B-LOC
on O
her O
|
     | O
prospect O
of O
walking O
at O
the O
next O
coronation O
, O
saying O
, O
that O
Lord O
Doncaster O
had O
evidently O
laid O
down O
|
     | O
twenty B-DATE
years I-DATE
of O
his O
life O
, O
lately O
  O
and O
that O
she O
had O
once O
seen O
the O
Doncaster O
diamonds O
, O
then O
|
     | O
considered O
the O
finest O
family O
jewels O
in O
Britain B-GPE
, O
which O
Queen B-PERSON
Charlotte I-PERSON
herself O
was O
supposed O
to O

     | O
have O
coveted O
, O
and O
the O
box O
containing O
which O
required O
two B-CARDINAL
footmen O
to O
carry O
it O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
The O

would O
shine O

in O
your O

and O
the O

     | O
would O
be O
exquisite O

I O
have O
heard O

, O
that O
people O
in O
this O
perverse O
world O
will O
not O
be O

     | O
happy O
  O
that O
those O

have O
every O

and O
not O

for O

I O
wonder O
where O
the B-ORG
Marchioness I-ORG
of I-ORG
Doncaster I-ORG
could O
find O

     | O
one O

You O
might O
drive O
away O

in O
that O
beautiful O
pony O
carriage O

kill O
time O
with O
your O
grand O

     | O
pianoforte O

and O
read O
your O
own O
happiness O
in O
the O
envy O
of O
every O
one O
around O

Even O
your O

seems O

     | O
scarcely O
so O
happy O
at O
your O
good O

" O
replied O
Marion B-PERSON

     | O
warmly O
, O
when O
thus O
appealed O
to O
. O
" O
But O
if O

any O

let O
no O

ask O

     | O
me O
what O
I O
think O
, O
as O
it O
is O
quite O
enough O

| 
  | O
Tears O
of O
indignant O
sorrow O
sprang O
into O
Marion B-ORG
's O
eyes O
, O
and O
she O
gazed O
earnestly O
out O
of O
the O
|
     | O
window O
, O
trying O
to O
conceal O
and O
to O
conquer O
her O
emotion O
, O
while O
Mrs. O
O'Donoghoe B-PERSON
exclaimed O
, O
in O
a O
|
     | O
tone O
of O
satirical O
burlesque O
, O
| 
  
  | O
" O
For O
of O
the O

As O
their O
carriage O
drove O
on O
, O
the O
night O
being O
clear O

moon O

lit O

the O
wind O
sweeping O
over O
the O

     | O
earth O
with O
a O
rushing O
sound O
, O
and O
ten B-CARDINAL

stars O
twinkling O
in O
the O
blue O
vault O
above O
, O
Agnes B-LOC
|
     | O
remarked O
, O
in O
accents O
of O
surprise O
, O
that O
crowds O
of O
people O
were O
running O
eagerly O
on O
the O
road O
, O
with O
|
     | O
animated O
looks O
, O
and O
an O
appearance O
of O
most O
unusual O
excitement O
. O
Soon O
after O
she O
heard O
a O
rumbling O
|
     | O
noise O
behind O
, O
as O
of O
some O
heavy O
vehicle O
hurtling O
and O
thundering O
along O
the O
road O
  O
and O
the O
next O
|
     | O
moment O
a O
fire O
- O
engine O
passed O
at O
full O
speed O
, O
amidst O
the O
cheers O
and O
vociferations O
of O
a O
dense O
|
     | O
multitude O
, O
who O
assisted O

followed O
its O
progress O
, O
with O
looks O
of O
mingled O
curiosity O
, O
delight O
, O
|
     | O
and O
apprehension O
. O
| 
  | O
Marion O
hastily O
thrust O
her O
head O
far O
out O
of O
the O
carriage O
, O
and O
perceived O
that O
a O
lurid O
glare O
|
     | O
burned O
on O
the O
sky O
, O
evidently O
reflected O
from O
High B-ORG
Harrowgate I-ORG
, O
while O
bright O
spiral O
flames O
shot O
|
     | O
upwards O
into O
the O
flaming O
arch O
above O
, O
and O
burning O
flakes O
of O
fire O
descended O
in O
showers O
of O
|
     | O
terrifying O
brilliancy O
. O
Every O
now O
and O
then O
a O
fresh O
burst O
of O
dazzling O
light O
blazed O
to O
the O
very O
|
     | O
heavens O
, O
while O
Marion B-ORG
watched O
the O
flickering O
flames O
with O
intense O
and O
solemn O
interest O
  O
but O
|
     | O
Agnes B-LOC
, O
after O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
surprise O
was O
over O
, O
sank O
lazily O
back O
into O
the O
carriage O
, O
saying O
, O
with O
a O

     | O
look O

peevish O
disappointment O

" O

withdrawn O
— O
the O
surrounding O
scene O
|
     | O
seemed O
one B-CARDINAL
mighty O
furnace O
— O
and O
the O
roaring O
noise O
of O
the O
flames O
was O
now O
distinctly O
audible O
. O
At O
a O
|
     | O
turn O
of O
the O
road O
the O
whole O
became O
distinctly O
visible O
  O
and O
Marion B-ORG
, O
suddenly O
uttering O
a O
wild O
cry O
|
     | O
of O
horror O
and O
amazement O
, O
covered O
her O
face O
with O
her O
hands O
, O
and O
sank O
back O
, O
almost O
fainting O
, O
in O
|
     | O
the O
carriage O
  O
for O
she O
had O
at O
once O
become O
aware O
that O
the O
fire O
must O
be O
among O
the O
houses O
where O
Sir O
|
     | O
Arthur B-PERSON
lodged O
. O
The O
garden O
around O
them O
was O
one B-CARDINAL
vivid O
blaze O
of O
burning O
light O
— O
the O
stems O
of O
the O
|
     | O
trees O
were O
visible O
in O
dark O
relief O
, O
on O
a O
drapery O
of O
fire O
— O
while O
a O
brilliant O
pillar O
of O
flame O
, O
like O
|
     | O
a O
gigantic O
serpent O
, O
twirled O
its O
enormous O
coils O
upwards O
into O
the O
very O
sky O
. O
Forked O
flames O
|
     | O
appeared O
bursting O
from O
every O
window O
, O
and O
sweeping O
over O
the O
whole O
house O
, O
which O
was O
one B-CARDINAL
great O
|
     | O
reservoir O
of O
fire O
, O
while O
a O
black O
volume O
of O
smoke O
rolled O
far O
away O
to O
the O
distant O
horizon O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Is O
there O
no O
mistake O
? O
" O
exclaimed O
Marion B-PERSON
, O
wringing O
her O
hands O
with O
terror O
, O
and O
bending O
her O
head O
|
     | O
almost O
to O
her O
knees O
in O
unendurable O
grief O
. O
" O
Is O
there O
no O
hope O
? O
Tell B-PERSON
John I-PERSON
to O
drive O
on O

     | O
faster O

faster O

me O
out O

in O

     | O
trembling O
accents O

  | O
A O
dense O
mass O
of O
persons O
round O
the O
crashing O
house O
, O
wild O
with O
agitation O
, O
and O
vehement O
in O
their O

     | O
attitudes O
and O
gestures O
, O
prevented O
the O
carriage O
from O
advancing O
farther O
  O
but O
Marion B-ORG
instantly O
|
     | O
opened O
the O
door O
, O
sprang O
out O
, O
and O
with O
an O
impetuosity O
which O
nothing O
could O
resist O
, O
rushed O
|
     | O
onwards O
. O
She O
was O
not O
one O
whose O
faculties O
could O
be O
prostrated O
by O
terror O
or O
danger O
  O
for O
it O
was O

     | O
then O
that O
her O
quick O
judgment O
and O
generous O
spirit O
became O
most O
active O
  O
and O
while O
crowds O
were O

     | O
standing O
around O
, O
in O
vacant O
, O
helpless O
wonder O
, O
she O
reached O
the O
spot O
where O
a O
tottering O
ladder O
had O

     | O
been O
placed O
against O
the O
walls O
, O

where O
the O
engines O
were O
playing O
upon O
the O
blazing O
roofs O
, O
while O

     | O
flames O
spouted O
forth O
in O
every O
direction O
, O
and O
a O
confused O
din O
of O
cries O
and O
vociferous O
oaths O

     | O
became O
audible O
on O
every O
side O

  | O
Timid O
and O
easily O
frightened O
on O
slight O
occasion O
, O
all O
emotion O
now O
appeared O
to O
be O
dead O
within O

     | O
the O
breast O
of O
Marion B-ORG
, O
who O
paused O
, O

, O
with O
bloodless O
cheek O
, O
and O
a O
face O
as O
rigid O
as O
death O
, O

     | O
she O
seemed O
turned O
into O
stone O
  O
yet O
every O
word O
whispered O
around O
fell O
with O
frightful O
distinctness O

on O
her O
ear O

" O

perfect O
Guy B-PERSON

     | O
afterwards O

heiress O

off O

most O
mercifully O
she O

added O
another O

while O
crash O

     | O
followed O
crash O
in O
frightful O
succession O

" O
Some O
one O
talked O
of O
a O
blind O
gentleman O
being O
there O

     | O
that O
is O
probably O
a O
picturesque O
addition O

to O
give O
the O
story O

for O
that O

really O
empty O

" O

  | O
At O
this O
moment O
, O
a O
low O
murmur O
of O
grief O
and O
horror O
arose O
among O
the O
crowd O
, O
followed O
by O
a O

     | O
death O
- O
like O
silence O

In O
a O
part O
of O
the O
building O
high O
above O
what O

been O
consumed O
by O
the O

flames O
, O

already O
undermined O

the O
shutters O

window O
were O
slowly O
opened O
, O
the O
sash O

     | O
hastily O
thrown O
open O
, O
and O
the O
venerable O
figure O
of O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
appeared O
there O
, O
his O
grey O
hair O

     | O
streaming O
in O
the O
wind O
, O
and O
his O
head O
stretched O
forward O
in O
the O
act O
of O
listening O
. O
He O
raised O
his O
|
     | O
hand O
to O
his O
forehead O
, O
as O
if O
bewildered O
, O
and O
seemed O
evidently O
calling O
for O
help O
  O
but O
his O
feeble O
|
     | O
voice O
was O
lost O
amid O
the O
war O
of O
elements O
, O
the O
crackling O
and O
blazing O
of O
all O
around O
, O

the O
loud O

     | O
crash O
of O
falling O
timber O
. O
| 
  | O
No O
one O
had O
a O
hope O
of O
his O
being O
rescued O
, O
and O
the O
most O
selfishly O
indifferent O
looked O
on O
with O

     | O
breathless O
dismay O
, O
while O
Agnes B-LOC
threw O
herself O
on O
the O
grass O
in O
an O
agony O
of O
horror O
and O
despair O
  O

     | O
but O
Marion B-PERSON
rapidly O
grasped O
her O
hand O
with O
convulsive O
energy O
, O
saying O
, O
in O
a O
low O
deep O
whisper O
, O
" O
I O

with O
him O

" O
| 
  | O
Using O
the O
speed O
of O
thought O
she O
flew O
forward O
, O
while O
every O
voice O
was O
raised O
in O
loud O
shouts O
to O
|
     | O
stop O
her O
  O
and O
several O
persons O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
they O
became O
aware O
of O
Marion B-ORG
's O
rash O
intentions O
, O
|
     | O
followed O
vehemently O
in O
pursuit O
, O
determined O
to O
force O
her O
back O
  O
but O
eluding O
their O
grasp O
, O
she O
|
     | O
wrapped O
her O
large O
cloak O
around O
her O
, O
and O
ascended O
the O
crackling O
beams O
of O
the O
staircase O
, O
beneath O
|
     | O
a O
shower O
of O
glowing O
sparks O
, O
while O
blazing O
flames O
were O
running O
round O
the O
cornices O
and O
ceiling O
, O
|
     | O
with O
a O
sound O
like O
incessant O
thunder O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
smoke O
nearly O
blinded O
her O
— O
the O
smell O
of O
burning O
wood O
became O
suffocating O
— O
and O
the O
heat O
was O
|
     | O
nearly O
unbearable O
. O
Long O
wreaths O
of O
fire O
and O
smoke O
soon O
shut O
Marion B-PERSON
out O
from O
the O
view O
of O
those O

     | O
who O
followed O
, O

none O
could O
pursue O
with O
their O
eyes O
the O
fearful O
progress O
of O
her O
enterprise O
, O

     | O
while O
she O
hurried O
onwards O
, O
having O
one B-CARDINAL
only O
thought O
in O
her O
heart O
, O
that O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON

blind O

     | O
alone O

from O

room O
, O
though O
fringed O
with O
an O
intense O

devouring O
flame O
, O
which O
had O

     | O
almost O
entirely O
burned O
it O
away O

plank O
remaining O
close O

charred O

     | O
blackened O

shrivelling O

crackling O

the O
devouring O
element O

Over O
this O
Marion B-ORG
quickly O

     | O

cautiously O
glided O
  O
and O
opening O
the O
Admiral B-ORG
's O
door O
, O
she O
tried O
to O
compose O
her O
voice O
, O
saying O

     | O
in O
a O
clear O
, O
distinct O
tone O
— O

" O

replied O
he O
, O
turning O
round O
with O
a O
quivering O

     | O
lip O

in O
a O
tone O

piercing O
agitation O

answered O
Marion B-PERSON

hurrying O
with O
him O
towards O
the O
door O
, O
where O
they O
were O
almost O

dear O
uncle O

pray O
for O
yourself O

" O

  | O
Marion O
led O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
to O
the O
very O
brink O
of O
the B-LOC
yawning I-LOC
gulf I-LOC
, O
and O
cautiously O
placed O
him O
on O
the O
|
     | O
tottering O
gallery O
, O
deaf O
to O
his O
entreaties O
that O
she O
would O
seek O
her O
own O
safely O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
and O
|
     | O
imploring O
him O
not O
to O
render O
her O
enterprise O
unavailing O
by O
delay O
. O
Flames O
were O
leaping O
upwards O
in O
|
     | O
the O
dark O
abyss O
beneath O
, O
dust O
and O
mortar O
fell O
in O
clouds O
on O
every O
side O
, O
while O
the O
heat O
and O
noise O
|
     | O
of O
the O
flashing O
light O
became O
more O
and O
more O
terrific O
  O
but O
still O
she O
spoke O
calmly O
to O
him O
, O
in O
|
     | O
tones O
of O
confidence O
and O
encouragement O
, O
giving O
directions O
while O
he O
remained O
in O
sight O
, O
and O
|
     | O
anxiously O
watching O
, O
as O
he O
slowly O
and O
cautiously O
groped O
his O
way O
. O
All O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
's O
firmness O
of O
|
     | O
look O
and O
voice O
had O
now O
returned O
, O
as O
he O
questioned O
or O
thanked O
her O
, O
when O
suddenly O
a O
deafening O
|
     | O
crash O
took O
place O
over O
head O
, O
an O
impending O
fragment O
of O
the O
roof O
was O
precipitated O
with O
a O
roaring O
|
     | O
convulsion O
upon O
the O
spot O
where O
a O
moment O
before O
the O
Admiral B-ORG
had O
stood O
, O
and O
nothing O
now O
remained O
|
     | O
beneath O
the O
eye O
of O
Marion B-ORG
but O
a O
hideous O
gulf O
of O
smoke O
and O
ruins O
, O
one B-CARDINAL
bewildering O
medley O
of O
|
     | O
crackling O
beams O
and O
falling O
floors O
, O
a O
mighty O
mass O
of O
horror O
, O
which O
it O
made O
her O
giddy O
to O
|
     | O
behold O
. O
| 
  | O
Marion B-ORG
ceased O
now O
to O
speak O
, O
fearful O
that O
her O
voice O
might O
induce O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
, O
if O
yet O
alive O
, O
to O
|
     | O
return O
  O
and O
nearly O
hopeless O
of O
his O
having O
escaped O
, O
she O
now O
felt O
that O
no O
duty O
was O
so O
imperative O
, O
|
     | O
as O
, O
if O
possible O
, O
to O
seek O
her O
own O
safely O
. O
Yet O
what O
resource O
remained O
? O
Her O
heart O
beat O
hurriedly O
, O
|
     | O
stopped O
and O
beat O
again O
, O
while O
a O
choking O
sensation O
arose O
in O
her O
throat O
, O
when O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
|
     | O
she O
fully O
contemplated O
her O
own O
instant O
danger O
. O
The O
noise O
was O
like O
that O
of O
a O
mighty O
wind O
, O
while O
|
     | O
the O
flames O
swept O
the O
very O
heavens O
, O
with O
a O
sound O
more O
appalling O
than O
the O
loudest O
thunder O
, O
and O
|
     | O
she O
hurried O
almost O
breathlessly O
back O
to O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
's O
apartment O
, O
which O
had O
not O
yet O
been O
attacked O
|
     | O
by O
the O
devouring O
element O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
heat O
was O
even O
there O
so O
intense O
, O
that O
she O
hastened O
to O
a O
window O
for O
air O
, O
and O
a O
shuddering O
|
     | O
groan O
burst O
from O
the O
surrounding O
multitude O
when O
they O
beheld O
her O
  O
but O
no O
succor O
was O
near O
, O
while O
|
     | O
the O
door O
became O
instantly O
blockaded O
by O
shivered O
beams O
and O
smouldering O
ruins O
, O
which O
had O
fallen O
|
     | O
at O
the O
entrance O
, O
setting O
it O
on O
fire O
, O
and O
she O
saw O
around O
long O
aisles O
of O
flame O
, O
and O
deep O
caverns O
|
     | O
filled O
with O
surges O
of O
fire O
and O
smoke O
. O
| 
  | O
Marion B-ORG
felt O
now O
that O
death O
impended O
in O
its O
most O
terrifying O
form O
. O
It O
was O
no O
new O
thing O
with O
her O
|
     | O
to O
prepare O
for O
the O
certain O
approach O
of O
dissolution O
  O
yet O
often O
as O
she O
had O
tried O
to O
realize O
the O
|
     | O
idea O
of O
that O
mighty O
change O
, O
never O
did O
it O
appear O
before O
with O
the O
appalling O
distinctness O
, O
which O
|
     | O
now O
filled O
her O
spirit O
with O
unutterable O
awe O
, O
while O
standing O
as O
it O
were O
between O
earth O
and O
heaven O
, O
|
     | O
all O
beneath O
full O
of O
boundless O
terror O
, O
but O
all O
above O
promising O
peace O
, O
and O
full O
of O
hope O
. O
| 
  | O
No O
effort O
of O
her O
own O
could O
avail O
. O
Marion O
looked O
at O
the O
long O
line O
of O
tall O
houses O
on O
her O
left O
, O
|
     | O
untouched O
by O
the O
flames O
. O
She O
glanced O
at O
the O
crowd O
below O
, O
all O
anxiously O
gazing O
upwards O
, O
in O
|
     | O
death O
- O
like O
stillness O
, O
and O
at O
the O
garden O
, O
which O
seemed O
paved O
with O
faces O
  O
but O
while O
the O
consuming O
|
     | O
flames O
pursued O
their O
desolating O
track O
, O
not O
a O
hope O
of O
rescue O
appeared O
. O
A O
storm O
of O
burning O
ashes O
|
     | O
fell O
on O
every O
side O
, O
and O
all O
around O
was O
a O
whirlwind O
of O
fire O
and O
smoke O
. O
| 
  | O
Marion B-ORG
's O
figure O
became O
conspicuously O
seen O
at O
the O
window O
, O
every O
pane O
of O
which O
was O
already O
so O
|
     | O
heated O
by O
the O
blazing O
conflagration O
behind O
, O
that O
she O
leaned O
against O
the O
shutters O
, O
and O
gazed O
|
     | O
towards O
heaven O
, O
as O
if O
already O
lost O
to O
all O
connection O
with O
the O
world O
around O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Martyrs O
have O
willingly O
died O
in O
a O
scene O
like O
this O
, O
" O
thought O
she O
. O
" O
Let O
me O
also O
testify O
the O
|
     | O
faith O
in O
which O
I O
die O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Marion B-ORG
clasped O
her O
hands O
, O
while O
now O
her O
spirit O
rose O
superior O
to O
danger O
, O
and O
, O
seeing O
the O
|
     | O
hundreds B-CARDINAL
gazing O
at O
her O
in O
silent O
, O
horror O
- O
struck O
sympathy O
, O
she O
calmly O
pointed O
upwards O
, O
that O
all O
|
     | O
might O
remember O
the O
comfort O
derived O
from O
a O
hope O
full O
of O
immortality O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
heat O
had O
become O
so O
intense O
, O
that O
Marion B-ORG
, O
choked O
almost O
to O
suffocation O
, O
leaned O
farther O
|
     | O
than O
ever O
out O
of O
the O
window O
, O
trying O
to O
catch O
one B-CARDINAL
breath O
of O
air O
, O
when O
to O
her O
astonishment O
she O
|
     | O
now O
perceived O
the O
figure O
of O
a O
man O
descending O
from O
the O
window O
of O
a O
house O
far O
to O
the O
left O
, O
and O
|
     | O
having O
planted O
his O
foot O
on O
a O
narrow O
ledge O
of O
stone O
, O
which O
ran O
along O
all O
the O
buildings O
as O
an O
|
     | O
architectural O
ornament O
, O
he O
pressed O
his O
hands O
firmly O
against O
the O
wall O
, O
to O
preserve O
his O
balance O
, O
|
     | O
and O
, O
with O
a O
degree O
of O
skill O
and O
intrepidity O
scarcely O
to O
be O
credited O
, O
rapidly O
traversed O
that O
|
     | O
shelf O
towards O
the O
place O
where O
she O
stood O
, O
carrying O
one B-CARDINAL
end O
of O
a O
rope O
in O
his O
hand O
, O
the O
other O
|
     | O
extremity O
of O
which O
had O
been O
already O
fixed O
to O
the O
window O
from O
which O
he O
came O
out O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Marion O
! O
dear O
Marion B-PERSON
! O
" O
cried O
the O
voice O
of O
Richard B-PERSON
Granville I-PERSON
, O
which O
even O
at O
this O
awful O
moment O
|
     | O
thrilled O
to O
her O
heart O
with O
deep O
emotion O
, O
" O
we O
must O
live O
or O
die O
together O
. O
Trust O
yourself O
to O
me O
! O

     | O
Here O
is O
a O
firm O
footing O

Try O
it O
! O
At O
the O
worst O
you O
can O
not O
be O
in O
greater O
danger O
than O
now O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
While O
yet O
speaking O
, O
he O
had O
securely O
fixed O
the O
rope O
to O
the O
window O
- O
frame O
, O
thus O
forming O
a O
|
     | O
temporary O
balustrade O
, O
and O
after O
carefully O
assisting O
her O
out O
, O
he O
slowly O
led O
Marion B-ORG
with O
one O
hand O
|
     | O
on O
the O
rope O
, O
and O
her O
face O
to O
the O
wall O
, O
safely O
towards O
a O
house O
as O
yet O
untouched O
by O
the O
fire O
. O
| 
  | O
A O
low O
, O
whispering O
murmur O
of O
intense O
interest O
arose O
among O
the O
spectators O
, O
when O
they O
saw O
hopes O
|
     | O
of O
her O
being O
preserved O
, O
but O
not O
a O
voice O
was O
raised O
till O
they O
perceived O
her O
safe O
, O
when O
a O
|
     | O
deafening O
cheer O
burst O
from O
the O
spectators O
, O
which O
rang O
through O
every O
ear O
like O
a O
trumpet O
. O
Again O
|
     | O
and O
again O
it O
resounded O
, O
louder O
and O
louder O
still O
, O
but O
Marion B-PERSON
heard O
it O
not O
, O
for O
no O
sooner O
was O
she O
|
     | O
out O
of O
danger O
, O
than O
, O
with O
a O
cry O
of O
thankfulness O
, O
she O
rushed O
into O
the O
expanded O
arms O
of O
Sir O
|
     | O
Arthur B-PERSON
, O
and O
fainted O
. O
| 
  | O
When O
Marion O
recovered O
to O
consciousness O
, O
her O
first B-ORDINAL
evidence O
of O
returning O
life O
, O
was O
the O
deep O
|
     | O
blush O
with O
which O
she O
extended O
her O
hand O
to O
Mr. O
Granville B-PERSON
. O
Tears O
now O
streamed O
from O
the O
blinded O
|
     | O
eyes O
of O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
, O
while O
he O
spoke O
to O
her O
with O
every O
term O
of O
affectionate O
endearment O
, O
saying O
, O
|
     | O
in O
a O
voice O
that O
yet O
quivered O
with O
emotion O
— O

" O

have O
little O

affectionately O

a O

whose O
first B-ORDINAL
earthly O
wish O
is O
to O
render O
it O
happy O

" O
said O
Mr. O
Granville B-PERSON
, O
warmly O
. O
" O
I O
trust O
|
     | O
that O
for O
many B-DATE

we O
shall O
testify O
together O
our O
gratitude O

for O
the O

this O

     | O
night O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
A O
smile O
and O
a O
tear O
struggled O
hard O
for O
the O
mastery O
in O
Marion B-GPE
's O
downcast O
countenance O
, O
while O
|
     | O
Richard B-PERSON
continued O
to O
speak O
with O
confidence O
and O
hope O
of O
the O
happy O
future O
, O
trusting O
that O
their O

     | O
engagement O
, O
though O
unavoidably O
postponed O
, O
could O
not O
be O
long O
delayed O
, O
and O
that O
if O
Clara B-PERSON

     | O
recovered O
in O
a O
more O
favorable O
climate O
, O
to O
which O
she O
must O
set O
out O
the B-TIME
next I-TIME
evening I-TIME
, O
he O
might O
|
     | O
speedily O
return O
, O
to O
resume O
his O
duties O
and O
occupations O
, O
with O
new O
motives O
of O
hope O
, O
while O
Sir O
|
     | O
Arthur B-PERSON
expressed O
, O
in O
brief O
and O
powerful O
language O
, O
his O
fervent O
wish O
that O
nothing O
might O
interfere O
|
     | O
with O
a O
prospect O
which O
secured O
the O
happiness O
of O
his O
beloved O
Marion B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Yet O
, O
" O
observed O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
, O
next B-TIME
morning I-TIME
, O
when O
Mr. O
Granville B-PERSON
called O
to O
take O
leave O
, O
" O
I O
dislike O
|
     | O
long O
engagements O
, O
and O
never O
would O
recommend O
one B-CARDINAL
. O
If O
you O
both O
remain O
constant O
, O
it O
is O
|
     | O
unnecessary O
, O
and O
if O
either O
of O
you O
change O
, O
it O
would O
be O
little O
worth O
to O
obtain O
from O
a O
sense O
of O
|
     | O
honor O
what O
should O
only O
spring O
from O
affection O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
There O
is O
nothing O
to O
fear O
on O
that O
score O
, O
" O
replied O
Mr. O
Granville B-PERSON
, O
exchanging O
a O
smile O
with O
|
     | O
Marion O
. O
" O
We O
are O
most O
apt O
in O
general O
to O
doubt O
where O
we O
have O
most O
at O
stake O
, O
but O
I O
have O
lately O
|
     | O
become O
almost O
presumptuously O
confident O
. O
I O
would O
not O
wish O
, O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
, O
that O
Marion B-ORG
should O
feel O
|
     | O
engaged O
one B-TIME
hour I-TIME
after O
she O
ceased O
to O
love O
me O
more O
than O
she O
could O
love O
any O
other O
, O
or O
if O
there O

     | O
were O
any O
man O
on O
earth O
who O
could O
value O
her O
more O

make O
her O
happier O
. O
One B-CARDINAL
thing O
I O
ask O
of O
you O
, O
|
     | O
dear O
Marion B-ORG
, O
and O
only B-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
, O
" O
added O
he O
, O
his O
eyes O
flashing O
with O
animation—"That O
till O
we O
meet O

     | O
again O
, O
nothing O
shall O
make O
you O
doubt O
my O
unalterable O
affection O

in O
asking O
this O
, O
I O
ask O
only O

     | O
what O
I O
intend O
in O

answered O
she O
, O
in O
a O
low O
, O
scarcely O
audible O
voice O
. O

     | O
" O
All O

" O
Then O
, O
as O

happy O

     | O
once O

again O

  | O
Marion B-ORG
listened O
with O
a O
quivering O
smile O
on O
her O
lip O
, O
while O
a O
tear O
trembled O
in O
her O
eye O
. O
For O
a O
|
     | O
moment O
, O
the O
blood O
forsook O
her O
cheek O
, O
and O
returned O
again O
in O
rushing O
torrents O
over O
her O
whole O
|
     | O
countenance O
, O
while O
the O
eloquence O
of O
the O
heart O
was O
in O
her O
eyes O
, O
though O
she O
attempted O
not O
to O

     | O
reply O
  O
and O
Mr. O
Granville B-PERSON
continued O
, O
in O
accents O
of O
the O
deepest O
tenderness O
, O
— O

  | O
" O
It O
grieves O
me O
more O
and O
more O
every O
day O
to O
think O
of O
leaving O
you O
, O

my O
duty O
to O
Clara B-GPE
must O
not O

     | O
be O
postponed O
any O
longer O
. O
Her O
strength O
is O
gradually O
diminishing O
, O
and O
though O
she O
does O
not O
idly O
or O
|
     | O
selfishly O
indulge O
her O
feelings O
, O
yet O
here O
, O
above O
all O
places O
, O
she O
seems O
least O
likely O
to O
forget O
a O

     | O
sorrow O
, O
which O
is O
, O
I O
trust O
, O
not O
incurable O

We O
, O
who O
are O
Christians B-NORP

know O
that O
there O
is O
some O
good O

     | O
purpose O
in O
her O
affliction O

that O
the O
lightest O
straw O
which O
casts O
its O
balance O
into O
our O

ordained O

" O

" O
Yes O
, O
" O
replied O
Marion B-PERSON
. O
" O
In O
going O
through O
life O

I O
feel O
myself O
reading O
a O
book O

the O
best O
of O

all O
authors O

Many O
of O
the O
incidents O
, O
as O
we O
advance O

surprise O

disappoint O
us O
  O

, O
knowing O

     | O
that O
the O
whole O
is O
on O
a O
plan O

could O
not O

we O

all O
shall O
turn O

out O
right O
and O
best O
in O
the O
end O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
It O
is O
a O
conviction O
such O
as O
you O
describe O
, O
Marion B-ORG

which O
allays O
the O
torturing O
and O
almost O

     | O
feverish O
anxiety O

warmest O
affections O

kindled O

observed O
Mr. O
Granville B-PERSON
. O
" O

" O
| 
  | O
Mr. O
Granville B-PERSON
at O
length O
took O
leave O
  O

, O
as O
he O
hurried O
for O
the O
last O
time O
across O
the O
common O
, O
|
     | O
Marion B-ORG
leaned O
against O
the O
window O
, O
and O
followed O
him O
with O
her O
eyes O
till O
he O
vanished O
out O
of O
sight O
  O
|
     | O
while O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON

countenance O
shewed O
that O
his O
kind O
heart O
was O
full O
of O
anxiety O

sorrow O
  O
for O

had O
seen O
many O
vicissitudes O
in O
human O
life O

human O
attachment O
, O
therefore O
he O
trembled O
for O
the O

     | O
possibility O
of O
sorrow O
hereafter O
, O
to O
one O
whom O
he O
loved O
with O
all O
the O
unbounded O
warmth O
of O
his O

nature O

| 
  | O
Marion B-ORG
closed O
her O
eyes O
that B-TIME

the O

elevated O
her O

by O

CHAPTER O
XXXIX O
. O
| 
  | O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
had O
heard O
, O
with O
frantic O
alarm O
, O
of O
the O
fearful O
danger O
from O
which O
Marion B-PERSON
|
     | O
was O
so O
wonderfully O
delivered O
  O
and O
then O
, O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
, O
he O
discovered O
the O
whole O
depth O
and O
|
     | O
reality O
of O
his O
love O
. O
The O
gracefulness O
of O
every O
thought O
which O
she O
expressed O
, O
and O
the O
bright O
|
     | O
beauty O
of O
that O
look O
with O
which O
it O
was O
accompanied O
, O
had O
made O
an O
indelible O
impression O
on O
his O
|
     | O
heart O
, O
so O
that O
now O
, O
when O
he O
saw O
her O
so O
unexpectedly O
snatched O
from O
the O
jaws O
of O
death O
, O
no O
words O
|
     | O
could O
do O
justice O
to O
his O
emotion O
. O
He O
hurried O
that O
very O
evening O
to O
ascertain O
the O
reality O
of O
her O
|
     | O
escape O
, O
and O
to O
say O
what O
he O
could O
on O
the O
occasion O
  O
while O
the O
tremulousness O
of O
his O
voice O
, O
and O
the O
|
     | O
quivering O
of O
his O
lip O
, O
gave O
a O
degree O
of O
depth O
and O
reality O
to O
his O
few O
incoherent O
sentences O
, O
which O
|
     | O
all O
his O
well O
- O
turned O
speeches O
in O
former O
times O
had O
failed O
to O
convey O
. O
Marion O
thanked O
him O
warmly O
|
     | O
for O
his O
friendly O
sympathy O
, O
and O
spoke O
to O
him O
with O
all O
the O
intimacy O
of O
relationship O
and O
old O
|
     | O
acquaintance O
  O
but O
when O
she O
turned O
to O
Mr. O
Granville B-PERSON
, O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
then O
observed O
the O
|
     | O
flutter O
of O
her O
voice O
, O
the O
deep O
tone O
of O
tenderness O
, O
and O
the O
look O
full O
of O
confidence O
and O
full O
of O
|
     | O
interest O
, O
with O
which O
she O
spoke O
to O
him O
, O
and O
to O
him O
only O
  O
while O
there O
was O
a O
degree O
of O
tact O
and O
|
     | O
delicacy O
in O
her O
manner O
of O
testifying O
the O
wide O
disparity O
of O
her O
feelings O
, O
which O
left O
him O
nothing O
|
     | O
of O
which O
to O
complain O

Careless O
of O
the O
dry O
and O
sarcastic O
air O
with O
which O
Agnes B-LOC
watched O
his O

     | O
mortification O
, O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
did O
not O
even O
take O
the O

interrupting O
himself O

during O

     | O
a O
paroxysm O

angry O

with O
a O
start O

eager O
curiosity O

Hereafter O
a O

recollection O

the O
hours O

there O
is O
no O
such O

now O
! O
You O
, O
who O
delight O
in O
making O
all O
others O
happy O
, O
would O
condemn O
me O
to O
misery O

The O
thought O

my O

     | O
defeated O
hopes O
will O
forever O
ring O
upon O
my O
heart O

The O
remembrance O
, O
that O
when O
I O
asked O
that O
of O
you O

     | O
which O
I O
never O
asked O
before O

you O
coldly O

indifferently O
rejected O
me O

" O

" O

indifferently O
, O
but O
with O
heartfelt O
gratitude O
for O
your O
disinterested O
preference O

answered O

     | O
Marion O

in O
a O
low O
, O
agitated O
voice O
. O
" O
If O
already O

I O
could O

I O
owe O

     | O
myself O

Richard B-PERSON

to O
say O
that O
my O
answer O
is O
final,—that O
we O
never O
can O
be O
more O
to O
each O
other O

     | O

that O
I O
sincerely O
hope O
the O
time O
may O
come O

when O
we O
shall O
meet O
as O
we O
did O

     | O
formerly O
, O
without O
emotion O

with O
kind O
and O
cousinly O
regard O
. O
" O

  | O
" O
Never O
! O
oh O
never O
! O
The O
very O
thought O
shows O
you O
have O
never O
loved O
as O
I O
do O
! O
I O
could O
not O
be O
in O
the O

     | O
same O
room O
with O
you,—no O
! O
not O
in O

You O
may O
pity O

with O
a O
deep O

out O

the O
house O

nearly O
suffocated O
by O

as O

under O

     | O
at O
all O
hazards O

to O
persevere O
with O
unalterable O
pertinacity O

only O
with O
his O
dying O
breath O

Life O
is O
indeed O
a O
complicated O
and O
mysterious O
drama O
, O
in O
which O
Agnes B-LOC
felt O
more O
and O
more O

dissatisfied O
with O
the O
part O

had O
to O
play O

Harrowgate O

the O

of O
many O

scenes O

  O

now O
Lord O

departed O
with O
a O
vaguely O

expressed O
hope O
of O

     | O
her O
visiting O
him O
at O
Kilmarnock B-FAC
Abbey I-FAC
  O
and O
when O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
felt O
sufficiently O
recovered O
to O
begin O

     | O
his O
long O

desired O
progress O
towards O
home O
, O
she O
slowly O
and O
sadly O
prepared O
to O
accompany O
him O
. O

  | O
Before O
they O
reached O
Portobello B-ORG
, O
winter B-DATE
had O
already O
covered O
the O
earth O
in O
a O
shroud O

snow O
and O

     | O
of O
ice O

birds O
no O

carolled O
gladly O

departed O
from O
the O
face O
of O
nature O
, O
which O
looked O
, O
as O
Agnes B-LOC
remarked O
, O
like O
a O
wedding O
- O
cake O

     | O
without O
the O
ornaments O
  O
and O
amidst O
weeks B-DATE
of O
dreary O
discontent O
, O
she O
compared O
the O
death O
- O
like O

contrast O
of O
nature O

from O
what O
it O

to O
her O
own O
sadly O
altered O
feelings O

She O
appeared O

constantly O
now O
to O
be O
in O
a O
state O
of O
restless O
, O
almost O
feverish O
excitement O
, O
always O
, O
evidently O
, O
|
     | O
expecting O
some O
event O
which O
never O
happened O
, O
while O
she O
became O
daily B-DATE
more O
depressed O
and O

     | O
irritable O
. O

in O
the O

time O

during O
many O

long O
and O
dreary O
evening O
, O
resolutely O
buried O
beneath O
a O

smiling O
aspect O
, O
her O
own O
anxiety O
respecting O
Mr. O
Granville B-PERSON

unaccountable O
silence O
, O
and O
devoted O

     | O
herself O
as O
entirely O
to O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON

comfort O
, O
as O

     | O
earth O
  O
yet O
still O
, O
every O
knock O
at O
the O
door O
made O
her O
heart O
palpitate O
with O
hope O
, O
and O
every O
note O
|
     | O
brought O
into O
the O
room O
, O
caused O
her O
a O
new O
pang O
of O
disappointment O
and O
surprise O
. O
| 
  | O
If O
a O
grain O
of O
hope O
or O
joy O
were O
to O
be O
found O
in O
any O
circumstances O
, O
Marion B-ORG

was O
a O
mind O
to O
sift O

     | O
out O
and O
enjoy O
it O
  O
and O
her O
buoyant O
spirit O
now O
shielded O
her O
from O
a O
too O
sensitive O
|
     | O
apprehensiveness O
, O
while O
she O
repelled O
the O
withering O
fears O
that O
might O
have O
forced O
themselves O
on O
a O
|
     | O
heart O
less O
candid O
and O
trusting O
. O
Her O
whole O
spirit O
rebelled O
against O
a O
vagrant O
thought O
of O
Richard B-PERSON

     | I-PERSON
Granville I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
inconstancy O
or O
indifference O
  O
though O
in O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
's O
letters O
from O
the O
continent O
, O
|
     | O
there O
was O
much O
that O
might O
have O
insinuated O
distrust O
into O
her O
thoughts O
  O
but O
Marion B-PERSON
clung O
to O
the O
|
     | O
unswerving O
belief O
of O
her O
lover O
's O
infallible O
truth O
. O
She O
knew O
that O
the O
stamp O
of O
Christian B-NORP
|
     | O
excellence O
was O
on O
his O
whole O
character O
, O
engrained O
in O
his O
very O
being O
, O
and O
only O
to O
decay O
with O
life O
|
     | O
itself O
  O
therefore O
her O
opinion O
was O
not O
at O
the O
mercy O
of O
any O
idle O
representations O
  O
but O
the O
blast O
|
     | O
which O
might O
have O
uprooted O
a O
superficial O
attachment O
, O
only O
deepened O
the O
root O
of O
her O
own O
, O
which O
|
     | O
nothing O
could O
undermine O
. O
| 
  | O
Mr. O
Granville B-PERSON
, O
in O
the O
mean O
time O
, O
having O
long O
ceased O
to O
hope O
for O
any O
answer O
to O
his O
letters O
, O
|
     | O
became O
more O
and O
more O
impatient O
for O
the O
time O
when O
he O
might O
seek O
a O
personal O
interview O
with O
|
     | O
Marion O
, O
of O
whose O
constancy O
not O
a O
doubt O
ever O
crossed O
his O
imagination O
  O
while O
day O
after O
day O
he O
|
     | O
watched O
with O
saddening O
apprehension O
over O
the O
declining O
health O
of O
his O
sister O
, O
whose O
failing O

     | O
strength O
required O
all O
the O
affectionate O
attentions O

lavished O
on O
her O
, O
especially O
when O
, O
after O
a B-DATE

     | I-DATE
few I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
, O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON

arrived O
at O
Florence B-GPE

Clara B-GPE
shrunk O
with O
blighting O
, O
heart O

broken O

     | O
grief O
, O
from O
every O
engagement O
that O
might O
endanger O
her O
meeting O
him O
. O
She O
mournfully O
acknowledged O
, O
|
     | O
that O
having O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
esteemed O
as O
well O
as O
loved O
him O
, O
she O
was O
still O
unable O
to O
conquer O
her O
|
     | O
misplaced O
affection O
  O
and O
that O
while O
nothing O

induce O
her O

unite O
her O
fate O
to O
Sir O

Patrick B-ORG

, O
or O
to O
place O
her O
happiness O
in O
his O
care O
, O
still O
the O
painful O
consciousness O
that O
he O
was O

     | O
unworthy O
and O
dishonored O
, O
weighed O
the O
more O
deeply O
upon O
her O
spirit O
, O
and O
crushed O
her O
whole O
heart O

     | O
with O
anguish O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
constancy O
with O
which O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
tried O
to O
regain O
her O
affection O
was O
deeply O
touching O
to O
|
     | O
Clara B-PERSON
's O
young O
mind O
  O
and O
in O
vain O
she O
tried O
to O
blot O
out O
his O
name O
with O
her O
tears O
. O
Still O
, O
Mr. O

     | O
Granville B-PERSON
, O
with O
inextinguishable O
hope O

continued O
to O
believe O
that O
the O
germ O
of O
life O
must O
be O

     | O
stronger O
than O
it O
seemed O
  O
but O
day O
after O
day O
she O
faded O

drooped O

Change O
of O
air O
had O
done O
less O

nothing O
for O
Clara B-PERSON

feeble O
frame O

while O
she O
spoke O
often O

a O

affectionate O
interest O

respecting O
her O

though O
he O
observed O
with O

emotion O

that O
her O

only O

with O
a O
mild O

resolute O

countenance O

there O

a O

Marion O

kissed O
it O

ardent O

tightening O

mist O

     | O
thick O

with O

out O

she O
suddenly O

up O

moon I-PERSON

beam I-PERSON
streamed O

     | O
faintly O
into O
the O

giving O
a O
chilled O

spectral O
aspect O

A O
death O

     | O
stillness O
reigned O
beside O

unable O
to O
account O
for O
having O

so O
suddenly O
disturbed O

she O

     | O

about O
once O

fancy O

only O
a O

She O
listened O
in O
trembling O
astonishment O
, O
for O
it O

     | O
seemed O
as O
if O
in O
her O
uncle O

room O
over O
- O
head O

some O
persons O

up O

down O
the O

a O
sound O
sometimes O
reached O

her O

if O
several O
carpenters O

at O
work O

Finding O
there O
was O
no O
mistake O

Marion B-ORG
sprung O
out O

threw O
on O
her O
dressing O

gown O

rushed O
up O

     | O
stairs O

having O
hastily O
thrown O
open O
the O
door O

she O
stood O
there O
transfixed O
for O
a O
moment O
with O

     | O
amazement O

fear O

Through O
the O
glimmering O
dawn O
of O
light O
, O
she O
saw O
that O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
was O
up O
, O

     | O
completely O
dressed O
, O
while O
he O
appeared O
to O
be O
hurriedly O
groping O
about O
the O
room O
, O
as O
if O
packing O
up O

     | O
for O
a O
journey O
. O
He O
seemed O
unconscious O
of O
Marion B-ORG

entrance O
, O
who O
stood O
for O
several B-TIME
minutes I-TIME

     | O
watching O
him O
in O
speechless O
perplexity O
and O
consternation O
, O
while O
her O
very O
blood O
forgot O
to O
flow O
, O
|
     | O
when O
she O
saw O
the O
stony O
look O
of O
his O
eyes O
. O
His O
countenance O
was O
of O
an O
ashy O
paleness O
, O
his O
long O
grey O
|
     | O
hair O
matted O
over O
his O
forehead O
, O
his O
expression O
sad O
beyond O
mortality O
, O
and O
when O
she O
took O
his O
hand O
|
     | O
in O
her O
own O
, O
it O
felt O
cold O
and O
damp O
. O
His O
eyes O
wandered O
over O
her O
face O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
without O
any O
|
     | O
apparent O
recognition O
, O
and O
then O
giving O
a O
smile O
of O
utter O
vacancy O
, O
he O
resumed O
his O
occupation O
with O

     | O
restless O
eagerness O

" O

exclaimed O
Marion B-PERSON

throwing O
her O
arms O

     | O
round O
him O

her O
limbs O

faint O

trembled O
with O
fear O

your O

do O
you O
not O
speak O

" O
| 
  | O
A O
deep O
silence O
ensued O
. O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
evidently O
did O
not O
hear O
her O
. O
His O
cold O
, O
livid O
lips O
moved O
as O
|
     | O
if O
he O
would O
have O
spoken O
, O
but O
not O
a O
sound O
became O
audible O
, O
and O
with O
the O
same O
vacant O
smile O
as O

     | O
before O
, O
he O
turned O
away O

The O
terror O

stricken O
Marion B-PERSON
now O
felt O
utterly O
appalled O
. O
A O
death O
- O
like O

     | O
sickness O
came O
over O
her O
, O
horror O
and O
darkness O
seemed O
gathering O
over O
her O
mind O
, O
and O
apprehensive O
|
     | O
lest O
her O
senses O
might O
entirely O
fail O
, O
she O
hastily O
and O
vehemently O
rang O
the O
bell O
, O
calling O
loudly O
|
     | O
for O
assistance O
. O
| 
  | O
Marion B-ORG

was O
an O
intellect O
of O
that O
high O
tone O
which O
rises O
to O
meet O
a O
great O
emergency O
, O
and O
though O

     | O
nearly O
paralyzed O
by O
grief O
and O
terror O
, O
when O
she O
first B-ORDINAL
saw O
the O
fearful O
, O
ghastly O
smile O
, O
with O
which O
|
     | O
her O
uncle O
gazed O
around O
him O
, O
she O
now O
endeavored O
, O
by O
gentle O
persuasion O
, O
to O
make O
him O
lie O
down O
in O
|
     | O
his O
bed O
, O
and O
tried O
, O
by O
speaking O
in O
accents O
of O
tenderness O
, O
to O
recall O
his O
recollection O
, O
while O

     | O
impatiently O
longing O
for O
Martin B-PERSON
to O
appear O
  O

during O
the B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
that O
elapsed O

entered O

by O
an O
oppression O

     | O
almost O
without O
success O
  O
for O
Marion B-PERSON
observed O

him O
in O

that O
the O
blood O

     | O
scarcely O
flowed O

after O

time O

uttered O
a O
fearful O

convulsive O
cry O

rang O
through O

the O
room O

fell O
back O

to O
her O

remained O
by O

     | O
watching O

deep O

solemn O
affection O
every O
turn O

his O
features O

her O

assumed O
the O

death O

her O
tearless O

motionless O

Without O

she O
bent O
over O
the O

assisted O

     | O
in O
cutting O
off O
the O
long O
white O
locks O

his O
hair O

riveted O
his O

     | O
infirmities O
of O
the O
old O

the O
indigent O
were O
forced O
upon O
her O
notice O

that O

might O
hope O
soon O

that O

it O

be O
a O
happy O
escape O

The O
busy O

active O
, O

     | O
she O
thought O

had O
scarcely O
time O
to O
die O
  O
and O
, O
for O
herself O
, O
she O
considered O
death O
as O
a O
very O

     | O
unpleasant O
subject O
, O
which O
fifty B-DATE
years I-DATE
hence O
must O
be O
attended O

when O
the O

the O
dreams O

     | O
of O
her O
present O
life O
had O
vanished O

it O
seemed O
to O
her O
most O
preposterous O
now O
, O
to O
lower O
her O

     | O
spirits O
by O
melancholy O
reflections O
on O

off O

in O
a O

" O

With O

gave O

a O
band O
of O
iron O
seemed O
around O

as O
she O
slowly O
turned O
away O

CHAPTER B-ORG
XLI I-ORG

| 
  | O
With O
all O
the O
acute O
susceptibilities O
of O
youth O
, O
Marion B-ORG
now O
experienced O
, O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
, O
|
     | O
what O
it O
was O
to O
watch O
over O
an O
almost O
hopeless O
illness O
, O
and O
, O
with O
a O
shuddering O
sensation O
of O
|
     | O
unutterable O
woe O
, O
she O
tried O
to O
obtain O
that O
comfort O
from O
above O
, O
which O
nothing O
on O
earth O
could O
|
     | O
supply O
. O
Days O
passed O
slowly O
on O
, O
the O
longest O
and O
most O
melancholy O
she O
had O
ever O
known O
, O
while O
most O
|
     | O
of O
her O
hours O
were O
spent O
in O
prayer O
, O
but O
all O
around O
was O
gloom O
. O
Nothing O
could O
be O
more O
oppressive O
|
     | O
to O
her O
than O
the O
subdued O
whisper O
and O
stealthy O
step O
of O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
's O
attendants O
, O
his O
vacant O
seat O
, O
|
     | O
his O
darkened O
room O
, O
the O
mute O
and O
solemn O
looks O
of O
his O
physician O
, O
and O
, O
above O
all O
, O
the O
inward O
|
     | O
anguish O
with O
which O
, O
hour B-TIME
after I-TIME
hour I-TIME
, O
she O
sat O
with O
his O
hand O
in O
hers O
, O
watching O
the O
fluctuations O
|
     | O
of O
his O
feeble O
pulse O
, O
observing O
with O
awe O
and O
grief O
the O
pale O
ensigns O
of O
death O
gathering O
over O
his O
|
     | O
features O
, O
and O
feeling O
as O
if O
every O
labored O
breath O
he O
drew O
gave O
him O
but O
a O
momentary O
reprieve O
from O
|
     | O
the O
grave O
, O
while O
she O
could O
not O
bear O
to O
contemplate O
the O
probability O
of O
burying O
with O
her O
beloved O
|
     | O
uncle O
, O
all O
the O
dear O
and O
tender O
ties O
that O
bound O
them O
to O
each O
other O
. O
| 
  | O
With O
no O
one O
to O
console O
her O
, O
and O
nothing O
on O
earth O
to O
screen O
her O
from O
the O
desolating O
blast O
of O
|
     | O
grief O
, O
the O
whole O
fabric O
of O
her O
worldly O
happiness O
seemed O
crumbling O
to O
dust O
. O
Her O
heart O
was O
like O
|
     | O
an O
exhausted O
receiver O
, O
and O
her O
spirit O
sank O
, O
yet O
no O
inducement O
could O
have O
withdrawn O
her O
for O
an B-TIME
|
     | I-TIME
hour I-TIME
from O
that O
scene O
of O
solemn O
, O
deep O
, O
and O
awful O
melancholy O
. O
Throughout O
the O
long O
, O
dreary O
hours O
|
     | O
of O
night O
, O
each O
of O
which O
seemed O
an O
eternity O
of O
anxious O
care O
, O
Marion B-PERSON
felt O
too O
deeply O
impressed O
|
     | O
with O
the O
solemnity O
around O
for O
the O
indulgence O
of O
any O
violent O
emotion O
. O
Nothing O
is O
so O
silent O
as O
|
     | O
intense O
feeling O
! O
Stunned O
and O
stupified O
by O
the O
sudden O
affliction O
, O
a O
wild O
chaos O
of O
sorrow O
, O
fear O
, O
|
     | O
and O
amazement O
rushed O
through O
her O
young O
mind O
, O
filling O
her O
with O
agony O
, O
which O
tears O
could O
not O
|
     | O
relieve O
  O
but O
now O
was O
the O
time O
for O
that O
supernatural O
aid O
given O
by O
Divine O
grace O
to O
the O
humble O
, O
|
     | O
believing O
Christian B-NORP
. O
In O
silent O
, O
speechless O
prayer O
, O
Marion B-PERSON
found O
her O
first B-ORDINAL
and O
only O
relief O
  O
then O
|
     | O
she O
felt O
that O
her O
heart O
was O
read O
, O
and O
her O
sorrows O
pitied O
, O
by O
One O
who O
has O
shared O
every O
human O
|
     | O
grief O
, O
carried O
every O
human O
sorrow O
, O
and O
to O
whom O
the O
suffering O
sinner O
never O
applies O
in O
vain O
. O
| 
  | O
One B-TIME
morning I-TIME
, O
the O
grey O
light O
of O
dawn O
stole O
through O
a O
crevice O
of O
the O
shutters O
, O
while O
, O
in O
her O
|
     | O
lonely O
silence O
, O
Marion B-PERSON
felt O
as O
if O
the O
whole O
world O
were O
in O
a O
trance O
, O
and O
not O
a O
sound O
was O
heard O
, O
|
     | O
but O
the O
slow O
ticking O
of O
the O
clock O
, O
reminding O
her O
that O
time O
and O
death O
are O
forever O
advancing O
. O
She O
|
     | O
sat O
watching O
every B-TIME
minute I-TIME
change O
of O
that O
beloved O
countenance O
shattered O
by O
sickness O
, O
and O
|
     | O
evidently O
sinking O
in O
decay O
, O
when O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
unexpectedly O
opened O
his O
eyes O
, O
which O
once O
more O
|
     | O
beamed O
with O
intelligence O
, O
as O
he O
fixed O
them O
with O
a O
look O
of O
touching O
mournfulness O
on O
Marion B-ORG
, O
and O
|
     | O
called O
her O
by O
name O
. O
That O
voice O
, O
which O
had O
so O
long O
been O
dear O
to O
her O
, O
now O
sounded O
strange O
and O
|
     | O
unnatural O
, O
being O
palsied O
by O
weakness O
, O
while O
the O
glassiness O
of O
the O
grave O
was O
in O
his O
eye O
  O
but O
|
     | O
Marion O
, O
forcibly O
subduing O
all O
appearance O
of O
emotion O
, O
stooped O
down O
, O
and O
, O
with O
a O
momentary O
gleam O
|
     | O
of O
hope O
, O
kissed O
his O
pale O
forehead O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Marion O
! O
we O
have O
loved O
each O
other O
well O
, O
" O
said O
he O
feebly O
, O
extending O
his O
hand O
to O
her O
. O
" O
For O
your O
|
     | O
sake O
I O
would O
stay O
, O
old O
and O
weary O
as O
I O
am O
, O
but O
the O
far O
better O
will O
of O
God O
is O
otherwise O
. O
Before O
|
     | O
that O
clock O
strikes O
again O
, O
I O
shall O
be O
in O
a O
better O
world O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Marion O
covered O
her O
face O
with O
her O
hands O
and O
attempted O
not O
to O
speak O
, O
for O
she O
saw O
that O
the O
sure O
|
     | O
hand O
of O
time O
, O
and O
the O
heavier O
hand O
of O
sorrow O
, O
had O
indeed O
done O
their O
work O
. O
It O
was O
but O
too O
|
     | O
evident O
that O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
would O
never O
see O
another B-TIME
night I-TIME
, O
for O
he O
was O
about O
to O
awaken O
in O
the O
mighty O
|
     | O
dawn O
of O
eternity O
, O
where O
no O
darkness O
ever O
would O
follow O
. O
The O
frail O
, O
old O
, O
worn O
- O
out O
tenement O
of O
his O
|
     | O
body O
, O
so O
full O
of O
infirmities O
, O
was O
now O
to O
enter O
its O
rest O
  O
his O
head O
, O
whitened O
with O
age O
and O
|
     | O
suffering O
, O
had O
been O
anointed O
with O
peace O

, O

partaken O
with O
cheerful O
thankfulness O
of O
the O
|
     | O
banquet O
of O
life O
, O
he O
was O
evidently O
willing O
to O
make O
way O
, O
that O
others O
might O
fill O
his O
place O
  O
not O
|
     | O
disgusted O
or O
dissatisfied O
with O
existence O
, O

thankful O
that O

had O
tasted O
better O
joys O

those O

them O
at O

conviction O

generally O
given O

With O
a O
face O
livid O
as O
death O
, O
Marion B-PERSON
choked O
back O
her O
sobs O

restrained O
her O
tears O

while O
she O

     | O
listened O
to O
every O
faltering O
word O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
said O
, O
as O
if O
her O
life O
depended O
on O
hearing O
him O
. O
When O
|
     | O
he O
became O
silent O
from O
exhaustion O
, O
she O
attempted O
to O
whisper O
a O
few O
broken O
expressions O
of O
grief O
|
     | O
and O
affection O
in O
his O
ear O
. O
Unable O
, O
however O
, O
to O
think O

speak O
under O
the O
weight O
of O
her O
sorrow O
, O

     | O
she O
might O
have O
been O
mistaken O
for O
a O
corpse O
, O
but O
for O
the O
look O
of O
living O
agony O
in O
her O
eye O
, O
while O

     | O
struggling O
with O
a O
sorrow O
which O
tears O

lamentations O
could O
not O

At O
length O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
's O
breathing O
became O
uncertain O
— O
his O
majestic O
chest O
heaved O
convulsively O
— O
a O
|
     | O
damp O
, O
cold O
dew O
broke O
out O
on O
his O
forehead O
— O
the O
heart O
which O
had O
beat O
with O
every O
kind O
and O
noble O

     | O
emotion O
, O
could O
beat O
no O
more O

, O
giving O
a O
last O
glance O
of O
fond O
affection O
at O
Marion B-ORG
, O
a O
grey O
, O
ashy O
|
     | O
hue O
stole O
over O
his O
features O
, O
and O
his O
countenance O
assumed O
that O
strange O
, O
peculiar O
aspect O
which O
is O
|
     | O
seen O
in O
death O
, O
and O
in O
death O
only O
. O
Marion O
saw O
it O
, O
and O
long O
afterwards O
that O
look O
was O
forever O
|
     | O
before O
her O
sight O
. O
Nothing O
in O
all O
the O
earth O
is O
so O
unutterly O
sublime O
as O
death O
. O
Strange O
and O
solemn O
|
     | O
was O
the O
mysterious O
horror O
, O
the O
inexplicable O
wonder O
, O
with O
which O
Marion B-ORG
, O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
, O
|
     | O
witnessed O
the O
soul O
forsaking O
its O
earthly O
tabernacle O
. O
Day O
after O
day O
, O
when O
she O
returned O
to O
watch O
|
     | O
beside O
all O
that O
now O
remained O
of O
her O
earliest O
and O
kindest O
friend O
, O
while O
her O
heart O
seemed O
|
     | O
scorched O
and O
seared O
with O
grief O
, O
she O
gazed O
on O
the O
mortal O
form O
in O
ruins O
before O
her O
— O
its O
light O
|
     | O
extinguished O
— O
its O
tenant O
departed O
— O
its O
whole O
nature O
in O
a O
moment O
transformed O
— O
and O
, O
forgetting O
|
     | O
sometimes O
for O
a O
moment O
her O
own O
grief O
, O
her O
loneliness O
, O
her O
deep O
and O
fearful O
bereavements O
, O
she O
|
     | O
thought O
but O
of O
that O
purified O
spirit O
now O
emancipated O
into O
the O
regions O
of O
eternal O
glory O
, O
and O
|
     | O
almost O
longed O
for O
the O
period O
when O
she O
also O
might O
become O
as O
indifferent O
to O
things O
of O
time O
as O
the O
|
     | O
inanimate O
corpse O
beside O
her O
. O
Often O
, O
however O
, O
she O
tried O
, O
with O
an O
eye O
of O
faith O
, O
to O
look O
beyond O
|
     | O
the O
portals O
of O
the O
tomb O
, O
remembering O
that O
death O
is O
to O
a O
Christian B-NORP
, O
like O
the O
setting O
of O
the O
sun O
, O
|
     | O
for O
while O
lost O
to O
human O
sight O
, O
he O
still O
exists O
and O
shines O
with O
unfading O
glory O
and O
everlasting O
|
     | O
brightness O
. O
| 
  | O
When O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
's O
remains O
were O
placed O
in O
the O
coffin O
, O
Marion B-PERSON
felt O
as O
if O
the O
last O
link O
were O
|
     | O
severed O
between O
them O
. O
His O
better O
part O
had O
, O
indeed O
, O
already O
departed O
, O
but O
the O
cold O
image O
before O
|
     | O
her O
was O
still O
associated O
with O
all O
she O
had O
ever O
known O
of O
happiness O
or O
affection O
, O
yet O
, O
in O
the O
|
     | O
strong O
agony O
of O
her O
grief O
, O
when O
all O
seemed O
a O
gloomy O
chaos O
of O
solitary O
desolation O
, O
she O
felt O
|
     | O
consoled O
by O
reflecting O
that O
her O
own O
devoted O
care O
had O
assisted O
in O
smoothing O
his O
passage O
to O
the O
|
     | O
grave O
  O
and O
she O
could O
not O
but O
think O
how O
great O
must O
be O
the O
joys O
of O
another O
world O
, O
when O
such O
|
     | O
affliction O
as O
her O
's O
was O
not O
worthy O
to O
be O
compared O
with O
them O
. O
A O
wide O
horizon O
of O
sorrow O
seemed O
|
     | O
before O
her O
, O
long O
days O
of O
loneliness O
and O
longer O
nights O
of O
grief O
  O
while O
, O
though O
young O
in O
years B-DATE
, O
|
     | O
she O
already O
felt O
old O
in O
affliction O
, O
for O
a O
blight O
and O
a O
mildew O
were O
upon O
her O
spirit O
. O
Marion B-ORG
's O
|
     | O
sanguine O
mind O
and O
ardent O
feelings O
had O
nothing O
near O
her O
on O
which O
to O
rest O
, O
the O
whole O
energy O
of O
|
     | O
her O
being O
, O
for O
the O
time O
, O
seemed O
crushed O
and O
withered O
  O
the O
future O
appeared O
to O
stretch O
before O
her O
|
     | O
mind O
in O
a O
long O
vista O
of O
moving O
shadows O
, O
and O
the O
memory O
of O
past O
happiness O
, O
like O
gold O
in O
the O
hand O
|
     | O
of O
a O
drowning O
man O
, O
sank O
her O
only O
the O
deeper O
in O
grief O
. O
Her O
beloved O
uncle O
seemed O
still O
to O
be O
|
     | O
everywhere O
— O
yet O
she O
saw O
him O
not O
. O
In O
all O
the O
earth O
there O
was O
not O
a O
thought O
which O
did O
not O
pierce O
|
     | O
her O
, O
or O
a O
worldly O
hope O
which O
did O
not O
now O
bring O
an O
icy O
chilliness O
to O
her O
heart O
— O
for O
a O
dark O
cloud O
|
     | O
had O
fallen O
between O
her O
and O
all O
those O
whose O
affection O
once O
adorned O
her O
existence O
. O
| 
  | O
It O
was O
now O
that O
Marion B-PERSON
, O
like O
a O
tempest O
- O
tossed O
vessel O
, O
surrounded O
by O
darkness O
and O
fear O
, O
turned O
|
     | O
for O
direction O
and O
help O
to O
that O
steady O
and O
benignant O
light O
burning O
at O
a O
distance O
, O
which O
alone O
|
     | O
could O
direct O
her O
into O
a O
haven O
of O
rest O
. O
Her O
sorrow O
became O
gradually O
illuminated O
by O
hope O
and O
|
     | O
peace O
. O
She O
clung O
to O
every O
shattered O
wreck O
of O
happiness O
which O
remained O
, O
and O
sinking O
on O
her O
|
     | O
knees O
, O
she O
felt O
that O
no O
one O
could O
ever O
be O
completely O
alone O
, O
or O
completely O
miserable O
, O
who O
|
     | O
rightly O
used O
the O
privilege O
of O
speaking O
her O
wishes O
in O
prayer O
to O
that O
great O
and O
holy O
Being O
, O
who O

     | O
is O
the O
father O
and O
the O
friend O
of O
all O
his O
earth O
- O
born O
children O
. O
Marion O
had O
long O
believed O
that O
the O

     | O
happiest O
life O
is O
that O
most O
conformed O
to O
the O
will O
of O
God O
— O
that O
grief O
arises O
from O
not O
believing O
|
     | O
whatever O
is O
appointed O
to O
be O
really O
best O
  O
and O
now O
she O
found O
in O
the O
Bible B-WORK_OF_ART
that O
comfort O
which O
is O
|
     | O
nowhere O
else O
to O
be O
gained O

The O
deepest O
emotions O
of O
this O
world O
remain O
unseen O
and O
unknown O
to O
all O

     | O
around O
  O
for O
the O
strength O
of O
character O
which O
gives O

gives O
power O

Granville I-PERSON
lingered O

recovered O

lingered O
again O
, O
sleeping O
little O
, O
|
     | O
eating O
nothing O
, O
and O
patiently O
trying O
every O
remedy O
, O
though O
she O
herself O
was O
without O
hope O
of O

     | O
recovery O

at O

all O

beauty O
of O

consumption O

she O
sank O
slowly O
but O
surely O
, O
evidently O
hastening O
to O
the O
grave O
, O

still O
Mr. O

     | O
Granville B-PERSON
, O
with O
the O
tenacity O
of O
affection O
, O
continued O
to O
hope O
, O
and O
still O
he O
told O
himself O
that O

     | O
she O
might O
, O
perhaps O
, O
yet O
be O
spared O
. O
Day O
after O
day O
he O
sat O
beside O
her O
couch O
, O
reading O
, O
conversing O
, O
|
     | O
and O
praying O
with O
her O
, O
while O
his O
brotherly O
attachment O
seemed O
to O
grow O
only O
the O
more O
engrossing O
|
     | O
and O
considerate O
the O
longer O
she O
needed O
his O
care O
  O
but O
it O
became O
evident O
to O
all O
around O
, O
that O
his O
|
     | O
cares O
and O
hopes O
on O
her O
account O
were O
drawing O
to O
a O
close O
, O
and O
that O
his O
sorrow O
must O
soon O
be O

     | O
without O
hope O
in O
a O
present O

Letters O
now O
reached O
Mr. O
Granville B-PERSON
, O
announcing O
that O
his O
long O
- O
pending O
law O
- O
suit O
had O
been O
at O
|
     | O
length O
finally O
decided O
in O
his O
favor O

giving O
him O
an O
income O
more O
than O
equal O
to O
his O
utmost O

     | O
desires O
  O
but O
letters O
far O
more O
deeply O
interesting O
to O
his O
feelings O
still O
were O
missing O
. O
Often O
and O
|
     | O
anxiously O
had O
he O
watched O
for O
a O
single O
line O
from O
Marion B-GPE
, O
yet O
so O
well O
had O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
arranged O
|
     | O
the O
measures O
which O
, O
as O
her O
guardian O
, O
he O
persuaded O
himself O
it O
might O
be O
allowable O
to O
take O
, O
in O
|
     | O
order O
to O
intercept O
her O
correspondence O
, O
that O
not O
a O

perplexed O

so O
grieved O
for O

Clara B-PERSON

that O
the O
almost O
unexpected O
change O

appeared O
scarcely O
worth O

     | O
felt O
more O
deeply O
than O
now O
, O
beside O
the O
dying O
bed O
of O
his O
young O
and O
lovely O
sister O
, O
who O
took O
his O
|
     | O
hand O
in O
her O
own O
one O
day O
, O
while O
a O
fixed O
expression O
of O
tenderness O

grief O
appeared O
in O
her O

     | O
speaking O
eyes O

there O
was O
a O
melting O
softness O
in O
her O
voice O
, O
when O
she O
said O
: O

Mr. O

kissed O
his O

deep O
and O
solemn O
affection O
, O
while O
his O
cheek O

     | O
became O
pale O
and O
his O
lip O
quivered O
  O

his O
heart O
was O
too O
full O
to O

Clara B-PERSON
proceeded O
: O

her O
large O
, O
mournful O
eyes O
on O
him O

slowly O
closing O
them O

took O
her O

listened O

anxiety O

look O

Clara B-PERSON
turned O

     | O
away O
her O
head O

entreated O

     | O
he O

a O
short O
struggle O

was O
alarmed O

the O

     | O
received O
the O
visit O
of O
Sir O

alone O

On O
a O
couch O
near O
the O
window O
, O
into O
which O
the O
sun O
poured O

     | O
a O
flood O
of O
light O
and O
warmth O
, O
propped O
up O
by O
cushions O
, O
Clara B-PERSON
, O
with O
an O
unearthly O
brightness O
|
     | O
glittering O
in O
her O
eye O
, O
and O
burning O
on O
her O
cheek O
, O
looked O
more O
like O
a O
celestial O
spirit O
than O
a O

     | O
creature O
of O
earthly O

what O
passed O
between O
them O
, O
during O
the O
long O
interview O
which O

     | O
ensued O
, O
no O
one O
could O
tell O
. O
Clara B-PERSON
's O
features O
, O
when O
it O
was O
about O
to O
close O
, O
betrayed O
no O
agitation O
, O
|
     | O
but O
continued O
almost O
motionless O
for O
some O
time O
, O
while O
the O
tone O
of O
her O
voice O
became O
slow O
and O
|
     | O
languid O
. O
Gradually O
her O
words O
appeared O
fainter O
  O
her O
voice O
grew O
nearly O
inaudible O
  O
the O
color O
which O
|
     | O
had O
tinged O
her O
cheek O
died O
away O
  O
and O
a O
death O
- O
like O
paleness O
succeeded O
. O
Not O
a O
groan O
was O
heaved O
, O

     | O
nor O
a O
feature O
disturbed O

scarcely O

Sir O

time O
hastily O
to O
summon O
Mr. O

, O
and O

     | O
to O
support O
her O
in O
his O
arms O

before O
her O
countenance O
became O
rigid O
as O
marble O
, O

her O
ethereal O

     | O

  | O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
's O
grief O
and O
horror O
now O
became O
almost O
delirious O
, O
and O
he O
was O
tortured O
by O
a O
feeling O
|
     | O
of O
unutterable O
agony O
  O
yet O
still O
he O
seemed O
resolute O

doubt O
the O
fatal O
truth O
, O
to O
hope O
against O

     | O

from O

seeming O
repose O

     | O
her O
hand O
grew O
cold O
within O
his O
own O
, O
and O
the O
glassy O
fixedness O
of O
her O
eye O
carried O
death O
to O
his O

     | O
heart O
. O
He O
felt O
and O
knew O
that O
all O
was O
over O
, O
yet O
he O
could O
not O
allow O
himself O
to O
credit O
the O
solemn O

     | O
event O

, O
at O
length O
, O
covering O
his O
face O
with O
his O
hands O
, O
he O
groaned O
aloud O
in O
all O
the O
anguish O
|
     | O
of O
a O
sorrow O
without O
hope O
or O
resignation O
. O
| 
  | O
Mr. O
Granville B-PERSON
, O
forgetful O
, O
apparently O
, O
of O
his O
own O
grief O
, O
tried O
now O
to O
impart O
consolation O
from O
|
     | O
that O
rich O
fund O
of O
sublime O
peace O
and O
everlasting O
hope O
which O

, O
at O
such B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour I-TIME
, O
to O
the O

     | O
Christian B-NORP
  O
for O
, O
though O
his O
own O
feelings O
were O
lacerated O
and O
torn O
with O
a O
sorrow O
that O
seemed O
as O

     | O
sudden O
as O
if O
he O
had O
never O
till O
now O
expected O
it O
, O
still O
there O
was O
a O
balm O
for O
his O
wounded O
spirit O
, O
|
     | O
which O
soothed O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
anguish O
of O
his O
sufferings O
, O
and O
would O
at O
last O
, O
he O
knew O
, O
bring O
him O
daily O
|
     | O
more O
abundant O
consolation O
. O
No O
affliction O
seems O
to O
come O
so O
directly O
from O
the O
hand O
of O
God O
as O
the O
|
     | O
death O
of O
those O
who O
have O
been O
so O
truly O
loved O
  O
and O
in O
contemplating O
the O
wide O
gulf O
which O
now O

     | O
divided O
him O
from O
Clara B-GPE
, O
the O
manly O
spirit O
of O
Mr. O
Granville B-PERSON
was O
overpowered O
with O
grief O
. O
This O
|
     | O
seemed O
a O
moment O
too O
awful O
for O
vehement O
sorrow O
. O
He O
had O
watched O
the O
last O
struggle O
of O
existence O
in O

     | O
one O
with O
whom O
every O
thought O

emotion O
were O
hitherto O
shared O
, O

now O
, O
while O
her O
beloved O

     | O
well O

remained O
the O

, O
in O
the B-TIME
hours I-TIME
of O
solemn O
contemplation O
which O
followed O
, O
Richard B-PERSON
felt O
more O

     | O
than O
ever O
a O
desire O
to O
learn O
what O
is O
seen O

felt O
when O
the O
gloomy O
curtain O
of O
life O

withdrawn O

     | O
and O
the O
glories O

first B-ORDINAL
revealed O
  O
but O
, O
checking O
the O
speculations O
of O
a O
vain O
|
     | O
curiosity O
, O
he O
opened O
the O
pages O
of O
holy O
inspiration O
, O
there O
to O
find O
an O
inexhaustible O
fund O
of O

     | O
sublime O

elevating O
comfort O
, O
convinced O
that O
, O

The O
sympathy O

brought O
them O
daily B-DATE

together O

the O
young O
Baronet B-PERSON
learned O

venerate O

admire O
that O
holy O

     | O
faith O
, O
which O
as O
yet O
he O
could O
neither O
feel O

comprehend O
  O
and O
every B-TIME
hour I-TIME
he O
became O

the O

this O

, O
from O
old O

Some O
were O
written O

     | O
inflated O
expressions O

a O
few O
words O
in O
praise O
of O
Sir O

     | O
enough O
to O
convince O
Marion B-ORG

The O

     | O
common O

strange O

her O
first B-ORDINAL

when O
the O

so O

She O
felt O
as O
if O
nature O

herself O
should O

if O
the O
melancholy O
awe O
so O
impressed O

upon O
her O
own O
heart O
should O
extend O

everything O

nothing O

that O
sameness O

very O

     | O
few O

hope O

Marion B-ORG

surprise O
, O
|
     | O
when O
looking O
at O
the O
signature O
of O
Agnes B-LOC
, O
a O
broad O
line O
had O
been O
drawn O
through O
the O
name O
of O
Dunbar B-GPE
, O

     | O
and O
the O
whole O
was O
surrounded O
by O
a O
fantastic O
wreath O
of O
flourishes O
, O
exactly O
imitating O
the O
very O
|
     | O
peculiar O
way O
in O
which O
Lord O
Doncaster O
was O
accustomed O
usually O
to O
encircle O
his O
own O
autograph O
  O
and O
|
     | O
much O
she O
marvelled O
what O
this O
uncommon O
device O
was O
intended O
to O
indicate O
, O
though O
she O
secretly O
|
     | O
dreaded O
to O
hear O
the O
interpretation O
of O
it O
, O
which O
her O
fears O
had O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
suggested O
. O

As O
the O
mind O
and O

become O
more O
matured O
in O

they O
too O
often O
become O
, O
from O
sad O

     | O
experience O
, O
more O
apprehensive O
of O
evil O
, O
and O
more O
suspicious O
of O
earthly O
friendships O
  O
but O
it O
was O
|
     | O
otherwise O
with O
Marion B-ORG
in O
respect O
to O
Richard B-PERSON
Granville I-PERSON
  O
though O
a O
dark O
curtain O
had O
fallen O

     | O
suddenly O
between O
them O
, O
all O
intercourse O
was O
most O
unaccountably O
suspended O
, O
and O
the O
very O
thought O
|
     | O
of O
his O
attachment O
, O
once O
a O
pleasure O
without O
alloy O
, O
was O
now O
accompanied O
by O
a O
heavy O
, O
leaden O
|
     | O
depression O
and O
anxiety O

told O
herself O

thousand B-CARDINAL
times O
over O
that O
all O
would O
hereafter O
be O

heart O

stone O

while O
day O
after O
day O
dawned O
and O
closed O

     | O
without O
a O
line O
to O
give O
her O
comfort O
or O
to O
reassure O
her O
heart O

, O
accompanied O
by O
a O
letter O
which O
he O
had O
brought O
from O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
, O
strongly O
|
     | O
urging O
on O
her O
, O
in O
almost O
arbitrary O
terms O
, O
his O
earnest O
desire O
that O
she O
should O
reconsider O
her O
|
     | O
decision O
against O
her O
friend O
, O
and O
no O
longer O
wasting O
her O
affections O
on O
a O
penniless O
curate O
, O
who O

     | O
had O
proved O
himself O
undeserving O

her,—bestow O
them O
where O
they O
would O
be O
so O
much O
better O

     | O
appreciated O

where O

exalt O
her O
to O
so O
distinguished O
a O
situation O

Marion O
was O

     | O
astonished O
to O
think O
how O
Sir O

could O
know O
that O

had O
any O
cause O
of O
dissatisfaction O

     | O
against O
Mr. O
Granville B-PERSON

whom O
she O
had O
never O
even O
named O
of O
late O
  O

resolute O
if O
possible O
to O
avoid O

     | O
meeting O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON

was O
denied O
again O

again O
when O
he O
called O
, O
though O
to O
her O

     | O
surprise O
he O
persevered O
in O
almost B-DATE
daily I-DATE
inquiring O
for O
her O
, O

numbered O
his O
visiting O
cards O

     | O
conspicuously O
on O
the O
corner O
till O
they O
amounted O
at O
last O
to O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
a I-CARDINAL
dozen I-CARDINAL

  | O
Marion O
was O
sitting O
alone O
one B-TIME
evening I-TIME

beside O
her O
solitary O
hearth O
, O
and O
to O
a O
spectator O
she O

     | O
would O
have O
seemed O
of O
more O
than O
earthly O
beauty O
, O
though O
the O
cold O
tear O
stood O
unheeded O
on O
her O
|
     | O
cheek O
, O
while O
her O
memory O
had O
become O
haunted O
by O
the O
ghost O
of O
departed O
happiness O

She O
thought O
of O

     | O
her O
deceased O
uncle O
in O
his O
silent O
grave O
, O
yet O
it O
seemed O
as O
if O
still O
she O
could O
trace O
his O
step O
and O
|
     | O
hear O
his O
voice O
by O
her O
side O
. O
All O
was O
still O
as O
death O
, O
her O
soul O
seemed O
wandering O
in O
a O
mysterious O

     | O
existence O
, O
amidst O
the O
solitary O
and O
deserted O
world O
, O

itself O
grew O
dim O
within O
her O
breast O

The O
flood O

gates O
of O
memory O
were O
now O
unclosed O
, O
pouring O
into O
her O

a O
ceaseless O

stream O
of O
old O

     | O
suddenly O
attracted O
by O
hearing O
a O
carriage O
draw O
up O
close O
to O
the O
door O
, O
and O
her O
pale O
cheek O
grew O
|
     | O
paler O
, O
when O
a O
moment O
afterwards O
her O
sister O
hurried O
into O
the O
room O
, O
and O
with O
a O
strange O
, O
wild O
, O
|
     | O
hysterical O
smile O
, O
clasped O
her O
arms O
around O
Marion B-ORG
, O
and O
locked O
her O
in O
a O
long O
embrace O
. O
Marion O
|
     | O
thought O
no O
grief O
too O
great O
for O
the O
loss O
they O
had O
both O
sustained O
, O
and O
yet O
she O
became O
startled O
to O
|
     | O
perceive O
that O
Agnes B-LOC
was O
actually O
shivering O
with O
agitation O
  O
that O
her O
eyes O
were O
blood O
- O
shot O
, O
her O
|
     | O
hair O
dishevelled O
, O
her O
whole O
form O
shrunk O
and O
altered O
, O
while O
her O
lips O
quivered O
for O
a O
moment O
as O
if O
|
     | O
she O
would O
have O
spoken O
but O
could O
not O
articulate O
  O
and O
a O
look O
of O
unutterable O
anguish O
swept O
across O
|
     | O
her O
pallid O
countenance O
. O
At O
length O
, O
burying O
her O
face O
on O
Marion B-ORG
's O
shoulder O
, O
she O
exclaimed O
, O
in O
a O
|
     | O
voice O
of O
thrilling O
agony O
, O
| 
  | O
" O
I O

" O
I O
could O
love O
none O

so O

replied O
Marion B-ORG
, O
alarmed O
and O
shocked O
at O
the O
unexpected O

     | O
excess O
of O

grief O

" O

I O
shall O
find O

not O

alarmed O

If O
I O

     | O
had O
brought O

this O

I O
never O

it O
again O

I O
have O
been O
duped O
, O

     | O
made O
miserable O
, O
and O
, O
worse O
than O
all O

ridiculous O

The O
whole O
world O
will O
laugh O
, O
and O
well O
they O
may O
  O

     | O
but O
in O
the O
living O
death O
I O
have O
brought O
upon O
myself O
, O
still O
one B-CARDINAL

will O
never O

the O
very O

     | O
grave O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Marion B-ORG
gasped O
for O
breath O
, O
and O
tried O
to O
suppress O
her O
emotion O
, O
that O
she O
might O
compose O
the O
mind O

     | O
of O
Agnes B-LOC
, O
whose O
voice O
had O
become O
hollow O
, O
her O
eyes O
were O
brightened O
by O
fever O
, O
and O
there O
was O
a O
|
     | O
frantic O
energy O
in O
her O
tone O
and O
manner O
so O
tearfully O
agitating O
, O
that O
Marion B-ORG
entreated O
her O
to O

     | O
postpone O
all O
farther O
discussion O
till O
she O
was O
better O
able O
to O
bear O
it O
  O
but O
Agnes B-LOC
continued O
to O
|
     | O
pour O
forth O
her O
words O
like O
a O
gushing O
torrent O
. O

" O

my O
horror O

affright O

she O
entered O

Dixon B-PERSON

related O
to O

forsaken O
by O

Dixon B-PERSON

" O
continued O
Agnes B-LOC
, O
with O
a O
gasping O
sob O
of O
angry O
emotion O
, O
" O
that O
Lord B-PERSON

     | O
been O
equally O
deceived O
into O
believing O
that O

had O
amused O
him O

, O
after O
a O
time O

me O
, O
Marion B-PERSON

the O
recapitulation O

all O
that O

it O

into O
the O

looked O
upon O

think O
what O
folly O

ravings O

have O
disclosed O

The O
worst O
horror O
of O

fever O

that O
it O
betrays O
all O

to O
fancy O
that O

all O

there O
was O
no O
tear O
except O

     | O
of O
her O
shedding,—no B-PERSON
sigh O

of O
her O
breathing,—and O
she O
forgot O
to O
observe O
how O
Marion B-ORG
had O
|
     | O
banished O
all O
her O
own O
anxieties O
and O
cares O
while O
listening O
to O
the O
egotism O
of O
grief O
in O
another O
, O

     | O
thus O
bearing O
the O
whole O
burden O
of O
both O
. O
Agnes B-LOC
gradually O
delivered O
herself O
up O
to O
a O
state O
of O
|
     | O
peevish O
, O
listless O
, O
apathetic O
despondency O
. O
If O
she O
attempted O
to O
read O
, O
her O
eyes O
looked O
only O
on O
a O
|
     | O
wilderness O
of O
words O
without O
meaning O
  O
she O
had O
no O
taste O
for O
work O
, O
not O
a O
correspondent O
in O
the O

     | O
world O
, O
and O
never O
had O
cared O
for O
a O
newspaper O
  O
therefore O
unable O
to O
fix O
her O
attention O
on O
any O
|
     | O
employment O
, O
she O
proceeded O
with O
sullen O
, O
mechanical O
indifference O
, O
through O
the O
ordinary O
routine O
of O
|
     | O
life O
, O
without O
energy O
and O
without O
interest O
. O
| 
  | O
Agnes B-LOC
' O
mind O
was O
like O
a O
crushed O

, O
disfigured O
and O
valueless O
  O
all O
its O
buoyant O
hopes O
and O

     | O
fantastic O
flights O
for O
ever O
at O
an O
end O

She O
knew O
not O
that O
sunshine O
of O
the O
heart O
, O
often O
divinely O
|
     | O
given O
amidst O
the O
darkest O
hours B-TIME
of O
life O
, O
when O
inward O
peace O
, O
amidst O
external O
sorrow O
, O
might O
be O

     | O
compared O
to O
a O
cheerful O

quiet O

, O
while O
a O
torrent O
and O
tempest O
are O
raging O
unheeded O
around O

|
     | O
Agnes B-LOC
mistakenly O
believed O
that O
the O
only O
possible O
aggravation O
to O
her O
melancholy O
would O
arise O
, O
if O
|
     | O
her O
thoughts O
were O
turned O
to O
religion O
, O
since O
hitherto O
she O
had O
seen O
in O
it O
nothing O
but O
the O
gloomy O
|
     | O
terrors O
of O
futurity O
. O
She O
never O
had O
cultivated O
any O
taste O
for O
reading O
that O
infallible O
balm O
to O
the O
|
     | O
depressed O
, O
and O
least O
of O
all O
would O
she O
have O
thought O
of O
appealing O
to O
the B-WORK_OF_ART

relief O
from O

broken O
spirit O
, O

nothing O

ever O

     | O
annoyed O
her O
more O

Marion B-ORG

one B-DATE

from O
the O
fulness O
of O
her O

observed O
with O

     | O
soothing O
gentleness O
, O
that O

should O
be O
too O
grateful O

     | O
those O

" O

Mrs. O

On O

beholding O

     | O
any O
sign O
of O
human O
life O
and O
enjoyment O
, O
it O
seemed O
to O
Marion B-ORG
strange O

unnatural O
. O
The O
joyous O
|
     | O
laugh O
of O
children O
at O
play O
in O
the O

grated O
harshly O
on O
her O
ear O

before O

, O
she O
pleased O

     | O
herself O
with O

gaily O
singing O

passed O
along O

was O

     | O
ready O

feel O
for O
that O
most O
desolate O
of O
all O

, O
the O
blind O
fiddler O

playing O
his O
melancholy O

     | O
tune O
on O
a O
rainy O
night O
. O
Religion O
was O
to O
Marion B-ORG
now O
like O
the O
sun O
behind O
a O
fog O
. O
She O
knew O
that O

would O
before O

cheer O

revive O
her O
  O
yet O
for O
a O
time O

seemed O
shorn O
of O
its O
brighter O

     | O
beams O
, O
and O
, O
in O
the O
words O
of O
a O
Christian B-NORP
poet O
, O
she O
was O
ready O
to O
say O
, O

" O

The O
emotion O
which O
Agnes B-LOC
felt O
on O
first B-ORDINAL
returning O
home O
, O
had O
been O
only O
like O

molten O

before O
it O

cold O

She O
now O
grew O
daily B-DATE
more O
peevish O

     | O
discontented O
, O
and O
, O
far O
from O
affording O
any O
relief O
to O
Marion B-ORG
only O
aggravated O
her O
distress O
  O
for O
if O

there O
were O
any O
subject O
more O
disagreeable O
than O
another O
to O

harped O

fastened O
on O
it O

     | O
with O
ceaseless O
irritability O
, O
continually O
prophesying O
evil O
, O
and O
recollecting O
injuries O
. O
She O
took O
|
     | O
the O
most O
teazing O
view O
of O
all O
subjects O
, O
attributed O
the O
worst O
motives O
to O
everybody O

and O

     | O
spoke O

invectives O

all O
those O
by O

ill O

Far O

forget O

the O

shrank O
from O

once O

warmly O

eloquently O
in O

defence O
of O
her O

When O
Lord O
Towercliffe B-ORG
received O
Agnes B-LOC
with O
friendly O
cordiality O
at O
the O
door O

he O
had O
not O
yet O

     | O
relinquished O
her O
hand O
before O
he O
suddenly O
felt O
his O
own O
grasped O
with O
a O
convulsive O
start O
, O
and O
when O
|
     | O
he O
hastily O
looked O
up O
, O
the O
countenance O
of O
his O
newly O
arrived O
guest O
had O
grown O
pale O
as O
that O
of O
a O
|
     | O
spectre O
, O
her O
eyes O
were O
closed O
, O
and O
he O
felt O
her O
hand O
become O
as O
cold O
and O
heavy O
as O
lead O
. O
Too O
|
     | O
well O
- O
bred O
to O
notice O
her O
strange O
emotion O
, O
which O
there O
was O
an O
evident O
effort O
to O
conceal O
, O
he O

     | O
naturally O
ascribed O
it O
to O
the O
remembrance O
of O
recent O
family O

, O
when O
now O
, O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL

     | O
time O
, O
entering O
society O
again O

he O
silently O
led O
Agnes B-LOC

Agnes B-LOC
did O
not O
once O
look O
round O
the O
room O
, O
but O
she O
heard O
the O
low O
, O
deep O
tones O
of O
a O
voice O
with O
|
     | O
which O
she O
had O
too O
long O
been O
familiar O
, O
though O
now O
it O
must O
for O

be O
to O
her O
the O
voice O
of O

Captain O

between O
the O
only B-CARDINAL
two I-CARDINAL
young O
ladies O
in O
the O
room O

he O
continued O
still O
, O
with O
the O
same O
light O

     | O
laugh O
as O
before O
, O
to O
exhibit O
his O
rare O
gift O
of O
conversational O
humor O

vivacity O
, O
after O
giving O
a O

     | O
slight O
bow O
to O
Agnes B-LOC
, O
which O
she O
did O
not O

while O
her O

     | O
parched O

she O
afterwards O
retained O
a O
confused O
recollection O

having O
walked O
down O
stairs O
, O
leaning O
on O

     | O
the O
arm O
of O
an O
officer O
whom O
she O
had O
never O
seen O
before O

discussing O
the O
hue O

a O

the O

     | O
probability O

her O

were O
torn O
with O
contending O

Strange O
is O
the O
ignorance O

Agnes B-LOC
possessed O
an O
energy O

     | O
pride O
of O
spirit O

supported O
her O
now O
, O
while O
with O
flushed O
cheeks O
, O
and O
eyes O
brightened O
by O
|
     | O
agitation O
, O
her O
volubility O
became O
like O
a O
delirium O

What O
she O
said O
to O
the O
stranger O
might O
be O
sense O

     | O
or O
nonsense O
, O
she O
neither O
cared O

knew O
, O

her O

laugh O
sounded O
unnatural O
in O
her O

     | O
still O

on O

recklessness O

Each O

     | O
countenance O

in O
returning O
thus O
to O

altered O
home O

was O
pale O
and O
haggard O
with O
strong O
emotion O

     | O
Marion O
started O
up O
, O
giving O
an O
exclamation O
of O
sudden O
joy O
at O
his O
unexpected O
appearance O
, O
while O
a O
|
     | O
momentary O
smile O
flashed O
on O
her O
countenance O
, O
like O
a O
gleam O
of O
sunshine O
on O
the O
dark O
face O
of O
a O

     | O
wintry O
cloud O
  O
but O
his O
eye O
sadly O
wandered O
towards O
the O
portrait O
of O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
long O
|
     | O
lingering O
look O
of O
deep O
affection O
, O
and O
, O
covering O
his O
face O
with O
his O
hands O
, O
he O
threw O
himself O
on O
a O
|
     | O
sofa O
, O
remaining O
for O
some O
time O
buried O
in O
silence O
while O
his O
whole O
frame O
shook O
with O
emotion O
, O
one B-CARDINAL

     | O
burst O
of O
grief O
following O
another O
. O
| 
  | O
It O
was O
long O
, O
very O
long O
before O
Henry B-PERSON
could O
listen O
to O
the O
mournful O
detail O
of O
all O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
had O
|
     | O
said O
and O
suffered O
in O
his O
short O
and O
fatal O
illness O
  O
but O
the O
feelings O
of O
Marion B-ORG
were O
soothed O
thus O
|
     | O
to O
meet O
at O
last O
with O
one O
who O
thought O
and O
felt O
like O
herself O
. O
Grief O
that O
disperses O
itself O
in O
|
     | O
words O
and O
tears O
is O
speedily O
over O
  O
but O
theirs O
was O
of O
that O
calm O
, O
concentrated O
nature O
which O
|
     | O
consumes O
the O
heart O
, O
though O
Marion B-ORG
assured O
Henry B-GPE
that O
nothing O
had O
yet O
done O
her O
so O
much O
good O
, O
as O

     | O
this O

most O

  O
and O
then O
|
     | O
advancing O
, O
he O
received O
Agnes B-LOC
with O
an O
expression O
of O
warm O
- O
hearted O
kindness O
, O
which O
brought O
the O

     | O
hectic O
color O
for O
a O
moment O
to O
her O
cheek O
. O

When O
Henry B-PERSON
glanced O
at O
the O
expression O
of O
settled O
melancholy O
on O
the O
beautiful O
features O
of O

     | O
Agnes B-LOC
, O
a O
gleam O
of O
indignant O
emotion O
flashed O
across O
his O
countenance O
, O
but O
it O
was O
succeeded O
by O
an O
|
     | O
effort O
to O
appear O
cheerful O
  O
and O
by O
" O

that O

when O
he O
extended O
his O

saying O

with O
all O
the O

CHAPTER O

. O
| 
  | O
After O
Henry B-PERSON
left O
the O
room O
, O
Agnes B-LOC
, O
having O
inveighed O
with O
more O
than O
her O
usual O
bitterness O

     | O
against O
all O
persons O
, O

and O
all O

to O
come O
, O
retired O
to O
bed O
, O
|
     | O
leaving O
Marion B-ORG
to O
muse O
with O
saddened O
feelings O
on O
the O
untoward O
turn O
which O
her O
sister O
's O
mind O
was O
|
     | O
likely O
to O
take O
for O
the O
future O
, O
which O
rendered O
her O
every O
day O
a O
more O
uncongenial O
companion O
, O
as O
|
     | O
now O
Agnes B-LOC
had O
come O
to O
the O
final O
conclusion O
that O
she O
was O
herself O
the O
victim O
of O
unmerited O
and O
|
     | O
unmitigated O
misfortune O
. O
| 
  | O
About B-TIME
ten I-TIME
o'clock I-TIME
, O
Marion B-PERSON
lighted O
her O
candle O
to O
retire O
, O
and O
was O
slowly O
leaving O
the O
room O
, O
when O
|
     | O
she O
became O
startled O
by O
suddenly O
hearing O
, O
immediately O
below O
her O
window O
, O
in O
the O
street O
, O
a O
noise O
|
     | O
of O
scuffling O
and O
shouting O
, O
mingled O
with O
vehement O
cries O
for O
help O
, O
and O
dreadful O
oaths O
, O
till O
at O
|
     | O
length O
a O
wild O
and O
horrid O
shriek O
arose O
, O
which O
thrilled O
to O
her O
very O
heart O
. O
Having O
hastily O
|
     | O
summoned O
Martin B-ORG
, O
who O
hurried O
to O
the O
door O
, O
she O
paused O
some O
moments O
in O
an O
agony O
of O
alarm O
, O
and O
|
     | O
then O
rushing O
to O
the O
window O
, O
threw O
it O
open O
, O
and O
gazed O
out O
, O
being O
so O
close O
to O
the O
combatants O
that O
|
     | O
she O
could O
almost O
have O
touched O
them O
. O
Two B-CARDINAL
men O
were O
engaged O
, O
apparently O
, O
in O
desperate O
conflict O
, O
|
     | O
while O
Marion B-ORG
's O
eyes O
became O
fixed O
on O
them O
with O
the O
fascination O
of O
fear O
. O
She O
could O
not O
scream O
— O
she O
|
     | O
could O
not O
move O
: O
she O
seemed O
to O
have O
lost O
all O
power O
of O
motion O
, O
while O
watching O
the O
whole O
scene O
|
     | O
with O
harrowing O
interest O
, O
yet O
with O
the O
vague O
indistinctness O
of O
a O
dream O
. O
It O
seemed O
as O
if O
some O
|
     | O
frightful O
night O
- O
mare O
were O
upon O
her O
, O
and O
as O
if O
she O
were O
chained O
to O
the O
spot O
, O
yet O
there O
was O
a O
|
     | O
frightful O
reality O
in O
all O
that O
followed O
. O
It O
was O
a O
fierce O
and O
deadly O
struggle O
, O
carried O
on O
with O
|
     | O
the O
energetic O
strength O
of O
despair O
. O
Again O
and O
again O
, O
in O
a O
hoarse O
, O
deep O
voice O
, O
the O
fearful O
cry O
|
     | O
arose O
on O
the O
night O
air O
, O
of O
" O
Murder O
! O
" O
mingled O
with O
agonizing O
cries O
for O
help O
. O
Marion O
clung O
to O
the O
|
     | O
window O
for O
support O
, O
and O
shivered O
from O
head O
to O
foot O
  O
while O
she O
still O
heard O
the O
loud O
trampling O
of O
|
     | O
feet O
, O
the O
fierce O
tones O
of O
defiance O
, O
threatening O
, O
groans O
of O
suppressed O
anguish O
, O
and O
then O
a O
loud O
, O
|
     | O
delirious O
shriek O
of O
agony O
, O
followed O
by O
a O
sharp O
, O
gasping O
cry O
, O
when O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
combatants O
fell O
|
     | O
suddenly O
to O
the O
ground O
, O
as O
if O
a O
hundred B-CARDINAL
daggers O
had O
pierced O
him O
. O
| 
  | O
Windows B-NORP
were O
now O
thrown O
open O
on O
every O
side O
, O
the O
watchman O
's O
rattle O
became O
audible O
, O
there O
was O
a O

     | O
tread O
of O
many O
feet O
, O
the O
sound O
of O

voices O
, O

all O
seemed O

promise O

when O

amidst O
the O
death O

a O
strange O
, O
unearthly O
laugh O
, O
which O
|
     | O
sounded O
more O
appalling O
in O
a O
such O
a O
scene O
than O
all O
she O
had O
yet O
beheld O
. O
A O
mysterious O
dread O
fell O
|
     | O
over O
her O
heart O
, O
her O
eyes O
swam O
, O
her O
brain O
reeled O
, O
a O
faint O
sickness O
came O
upon O
her O
, O
she O
made O
a O
|
     | O
feeble O
attempt O
to O
support O
herself O
against O
the O
window O
, O
and O
, O
with O
a O
convulsive O
sigh O
, O
sank O
almost O
|
     | O
insensible O
on O
a O
seat O
. O
When O
Marion B-PERSON
recovered O
, O
a O
low O
, O
murmuring O
sound O
of O
many O
voices O
became O
|
     | O
audible O
. O
Martin B-PERSON
hastily O
opened O
the O
door O
, O
and O
a O
crowd O
of O
strange O
faces O
appeared O
, O
pale O
and O
full O
|
     | O
of O
horror O
  O
while O
several O
men O
almost O
staggered O
beneath O
the O
weight O
of O
a O
shutter O
, O
on O
which O
lay O
a O
|
     | O
motionless O
figure O
, O
partly O
concealed O
by O
a O
cloak O
, O
with O
a O
bloody O
napkin O
over O
the O
face O
  O
while O
the O
|
     | O
stillness O
, O
the O
stiff O
and O
rigid O
look O
of O
that O
immovable O
form O
, O
could O
indicate O
nothing O
but O
|
     | O
death O
. O
| 
  | O
There O
was O
that O
in O
the O
voices O
of O
those O
who O
entered O
which O
caused O
Marion B-ORG
's O
nerves O
to O
creep O
with O
|
     | O
apprehension O
. O
A O
low O
murmur O
stole O
through O
the O
crowd O
, O
while O
, O
shivering O
with O
apprehension O
, O
she O
|
     | O
silently O
gazed O
on O
the O
stone O
- O
like O
, O
lifeless O
image O
before O
her O
. O
The O
hair O
was O
damp O
and O
matted O
with O
|
     | O
gore B-PERSON
, O
the O
hands O
were O
clenched O
in O
agony O
, O
the O
dress O
soiled O
with O
clay O
and O
blood O
  O
but O
the O
tall O
|
     | O
figure O
retained O
a O
look O
of O
solemn O
dignity O
  O
and O
Marion B-PERSON
felt O
a O
cold O
thrill O
shoot O
through O
her O
|
     | O
heart O
, O
while O
her O
eyes O
became O
riveted O
on O
that O
ghastly O
object O
. O
| 
  | O
Though O
unable O
to O
speak O
, O
or O
to O
ask O
a O
single O
question O
, O
her O
mind O
was O
intensely O
conscious O
of O
all O
|
     | O
that O
passed O
  O
while O
many O
surmises O
were O
whispered O
around O
respecting O
the O
cause O
and O
origin O
of O
this O
|
     | O
fearful O
catastrophe O
, O
and O
much O
impatience O
was O
expressed O
for O
the O
proper O
authorities O
to O
arrive O
and O
|
     | O
take O
cognizance O
of O
the O
circumstances O
. O
Marion O
, O
at O
length O
, O
feeling O
herself O
alone O
among O
so O
great O
a O
|
     | O
concourse O
of O
strangers O
, O
had O
slowly O
turned O
to O
leave O
the O
room O
, O
when O
her O
ear O
was O
caught O
by O
hearing O
|
     | O
the O
name O
of O
De B-PERSON
Lancey I-PERSON
, O
and O
, O
turning O
hastily O
round O
, O
she O
started O
to O
find O
Lord O
Wigton B-PERSON
close O
beside O
|
     | O
her O
, O
in O
earnest O
conference O
with O
an O
officer O
, O
who O
remarked O
, O
in O
low O
, O
ominous O
accents O
, O
" O
I O
am O
|
     | O
perfectly O
well O
aware O
that O
several O
discussions O
took O
place O
between O
them O
lately O
, O
respecting O
the O
|
     | O
circumstances O
of O
his O
childhood O
, O
though O
I O
understood O
them O
to O
be O
of O
a O
friendly O
nature O
  O
but O
this O
|
     | O
very O
evening O
, O
at O
Mrs. O
Smytheson B-PERSON
's O
, O
some O
very O
high O
words O
, O
passed O
relating O
to O
a O
young O
lady O
. O
" O
A O
|
     | O
faint O
chill O
came O
over O
Marion B-PERSON
as O
she O
heard O
these O
words O
, O
and O
turning O
, O
with O
a O
bewildered O
look O
, O
to O
|
     | O
the O
speaker O
, O
she O
asked O
, O
in O
a O
low O
, O
deep O
voice O
, O
if O
he O
knew O
anything O
of O
Henry B-PERSON
De I-PERSON
Lancey I-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Yes O
! O
only O
too O
much O
, O
if O
all O
be O
as O
we O
suspect O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
stranger O
sternly O
. O
" O
I O
always O
liked O

     | O
De O
Lancey O
  O
but O
if O
he O

any O
hand O
in O
this O
business O
, O
great O
as O
the O
provocation O
may O
have O
been O
, O
he O
|
     | O
would O
be O
more O
like O
an O
Italian B-NORP
assassin O
than O
a O
British B-NORP
officer O
. O
He O
was O
heard O
once O
to O
declare O
the O
|
     | O
greatest O
abhorrence O
to O
duelling O
  O
but O
these O
canting O
sort O
of O
speeches O
never O
come O
to O
any O
good O
. O
At O

     | O
Mrs. O
Smytheson B-PERSON
's O
, O
not O
two B-TIME
hours I-TIME
ago I-TIME
, O
he O
seemed O
very O
violently O
irritated O
against O
my O
unfortunate O

     | O
friend O
who O
lies O
murdered O
there O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Marion B-ORG
's O
countenance O
became O
pale O
and O
terror O
- O
stricken O
  O
she O
looked O
irresolutely O
round O
, O
and O
|
     | O
then O
, O
with O
faltering O
steps O
, O
approached O
a O
table O
on O
which O
the O
corpse O
had O
been O
laid O
. O
She O
could O
not O

     | O
speak O
, O
and O
her O
hand O
trembled O
convulsively O
  O

she O
grasped O
a O
napkin O
which O
shrouded O
the O
features O

     | O
of O
the O
deceased O

Slowly O
and O
fearfully O
she O
raised O
it O
, O
gave O
one O
shrinking O
glance O
, O
and O
, O
with O
a O

     | O
broken O
shriek O
of O
astonishment O

beheld O

stained O

rigid O
as O

the O

Marion B-ORG

stood O
still O

cold O
shiver O

through O

tottering O
back O

with O
a O

     | O
gasp O

she O
sank O
upon O
a O
seat O

where O
her O
blanched O
cheek O

quivering O
lip O

the O

flew O
far O

more O

agency O

the O
dust O

a O
spirit O

of O

A O
summons O
at O

arrived O

for O

the O

as O
a O

unwarrantable O
suspicions O
which O
had O
been O

     | O
expressed O
respecting O

formed O
a O
strong O
additional O
motive O

Marion B-ORG
for O
consenting O
to O

     | O
accompany O
the O
melancholy O
cavalcade O

publicly O

acquit O
him O

Marion B-ORG
hastened O
into O
a O
carriage O

a O
solemn O
scene O

lamp O
hastily O

lighted O
for O
the O

An O
uncertain O

mysterious O
gleam O

cast O
on O
the O

while O

     | O
the O
more O
distant O
recesses O

thrown O

gloomy O
shadow O

the O
tumultuous O
agitation O
of O
those O

     | O
around O
contrasted O
strangely O
with O
the O
locked O

riveted O
limbs O
of O
that O
motionless O
figure O
to O

     | O
which O
all O

were O
directed O

the O
rigid O
stillness O
and O
stern O
composure O
of O
that O
countenance O
now O

     | O
invested O
with O
all O
the O
majesty O
of O
death O

from O
which O
Marion B-ORG
turned O
with O
shuddering O
sympathy O

     | O
amazement O
, O
while O
the O
multitude O
of O
servants O

continued O
in O
a O
state O
of O
wild O

     | O
excitement O

uttering O
on O

exclamations O

At O
length O
Lord B-PRODUCT

some O

deeply O

totally O
unconscious O
of O

more O
than O
ordinary O

     | O
notice O

advanced O
to O
Lord B-PERSON

with O
an O
expression O

sorrow O

wishing O

an O

unaccountable O
murder O

Not O
a O

while O
Henry B-PERSON
at O
once O

gallantry O

such O

thing O
might O
have O
been O

     | O
conjectured O
  O

Marion B-ORG
abhorred O
the O
very O
thought O
of O
his O
name O
being O
at O
all O
implicated O
in O
a O

     | O
catastrophe O
so O
revolting O
. O
| 
  | O
Some O
time O
elapsed O
before O
it O
occurred O
to O
the O
imagination O
of O
Henry B-GPE
, O
that O
the O
eye O

suspicion O

could O
for O
a O
moment O
rest O
upon O
him O
  O

when O
the O
idea O
flashed O
into O
his O
mind O
, O
it O
seemed O
so O
|
     | O
perfectly O
preposterous O
, O
as O
to O
be O
scarcely O
worth O
a O
thought O
  O
but O
he O
now O
perceived O
with O
indignant O
|
     | O
astonishment O
, O
that O
there O
were O
those O
among O
the O
spectators O
who O
cast O
on O
him O
dark O
glances O
of O
doubt O
|
     | O
and O
suspicion O
  O
therefore O
feeling O
that O
to O
be O
accused O
, O
even O
in O
momentary O
thought O
, O
of O
a O
deed O
from O
|
     | O
which O
his O
very O
soul O
would O
have O
shrunk O
, O
was O
intolerable O
, O
he O
advanced O
without O
a O
moment O

     | O
hesitation O
towards O
the O
table O
before O
which O
Lord O
Doncaster O
was O
seated O
  O

, O
placing O
his O
hand O
upon O
|
     | O
that O
of O
the O
corpse O
beside O
him O

he O
spoke O
in O
a O
firm O
and O
decided O
tone O
, O
though O
evidently O
with O
deep O
|
     | O
emotion O
, O
while O
the O
spectators O
crushed O
forward O
to O
hear O
him O
, O
and O
the O
dead O
silence O
around O
gave O
a O

     | O
solemn O
distinctness O
to O
his O
words O

uttered O
, O
as O

in O
a O
low O
, O
impressive O
tone O

I O
perceive O

with O
what O
degree O
of O
astonishment O

Henry B-ORG
bent O
his O
head O
to O
Lord B-PERSON
Doncaster I-PERSON
with O
an O
air O
of O
resolute O
but O
melancholy O
composure O
, O

     | O
stood O
back O
while O
several O
other O
persons O
gave O
their O
evidence O
, O

Marion B-PERSON
observed O
with O
surprise O
, O

     | O
that O
, O
instead O
of O
being O
occupied O
in O
attending O
to O
their O
depositions O
, O
young O
De B-PERSON
Lancey I-PERSON
gazed O
with O
a O
|
     | O
look O
of O
wondering O
perplexity O
all O
around O
the O
large O
, O
old O
- O
fashioned O
hall O
, O
while O
, O
with O
an O
|
     | O
expression O
of O
absent O
astonishment O
, O
his O
eye O
wandered O
over O
the O
gigantic O
chimney O
- O
piece O
of O
quaint O

     | O
device O
, O
the O
rusty O
armour O

trophies O
of O
the O
chase O

the O
old O

the O

tapestried O

richly O
sculptured O
ceiling O

At O
length O
he O
glanced O
towards O

     | O
Lord O
Doncaster O
, O
who O
had O
been O
for O
some O
time O
keenly O
observing O
him O
, O
but O
whose O
looks O
were O
now O

     | O
hastily O
averted O
, O
while O
apparently O
occupied O
in O
arranging O
some O
papers O

it O
was O
evident O
that O

     | O
the O
aged O
peer O

hand O
shook O
with O
agitation O
. O
Much O
might O
, O
of O
course O
, O
be O
attributed O
to O
the O
fearful O

     | O
event O
of O
the O
night O
, O
and O
yet O
Marion B-PERSON
felt O
that O
this O
emotion O
did O
not O
originate O
from O
the O
same O

     | O
cause O
, O
for O
the O
Marquis B-PERSON
cast O
frequently O
a O
furtive O
glance O
at O
Henry B-GPE
, O
though O
avoiding O
observation O
, O
|
     | O
and O
his O
excitement O
obviously O
increased O
. O
| 
  | O
Young B-PERSON
De I-PERSON
Lancey I-PERSON
seemed O
evidently O
struggling O
with O
some O
painful O
, O
agitating O
perplexity O
! O
Again O
he O
|
     | O
perused O
the O
room O
with O
a O
scrutinizing O
gaze O
, O
and O
again O
his O
eye O
became O
fastened O
on O
the O
aged O

     | O
features O
of O
Lord O
Doncaster O
with O
a O
steady O
, O
earnest O
examination O
  O
while O
still O
the O
expression O
of O
|
     | O
doubt O
and O
wonder O
on O
his O
countenance O
became O
more O
obvious O
, O
as O
if O
he O
were O
attempting O
to O
stir O
up O
|
     | O
some O
recollections O
which O
would O
not O
come O
at O
his O
bidding O
. O
Turning O
at O
length O
to O
Marion B-ORG
, O
he O
|
     | O
whispered O
in O
a O
low O
, O
almost O
dreaming O
tone O

" O

in O
a O
tone O

increasing O
decision O

his O
eye O
still O

look O

When O
Henry B-PERSON
, O
by O
a O
slow O
and O
difficult O
progress O
, O
had O
piloted O
Marion B-PERSON
through O
the O
dense O
mass O
of O
|
     | O
persons O
who O
filled O
the O
hall O
, O
they O
reached O
at O
length O
the O
spot O
he O
had O
indicated O
, O
where O
, O
lifting O
|
     | O
the O
tapestry O
, O
he O
at O
once O
opened O
a O
door O
, O
so O
nearly O
resembling O
the O
paneling O
as O
scarcely O
to O
be O
|
     | O
discernible O
, O
and O
they O
entered O
a O
small O
, O
low O
room O
, O
which O
seemed O
to O
Marion B-PERSON
no O
larger O
than O
a O

     | O
four B-CARDINAL
- O
post O
bed O
, O
so O
dusty O
, O
dark O
, O
and O
neglected O
- O
looking O
, O
that O
it O
had O
evidently O
not O
been O
occupied O
|
     | O
for O
years B-DATE
. O
Long O
cobwebs O
hung O
like O
banners O
from O
the O
roof,—it B-PERSON
was O
almost O
destitute O
of O
|
     | O
furniture O
— O
and O
they O
found O
a O
picture O
placed O
on O
the O
floor O
, O
its O
face O
towards O
the O
wall O
, O
representing O
|
     | O
a O
lady O
, O
young O
and O
dazzlingly O
beautiful O
, O
and O
a O
boy O
beside O
her O
, O
playing O
with O
a O
large O
Newfoundland B-ORG

     | O
dog O
. O
| 
  | O
Henry B-ORG
silently O
strode O
across O
the O
room O
, O
and O
, O
as O
if O
perfectly O
familiar O
with O
its O
arrangements O
, O
|
     | O
he O
threw O
open O
a O
small O
cupboard O
, O
into O
which O
had O
been O
thrown O
the O
broken O
fragments O
of O
several O
|
     | O
childish O
playthings O
. O
He O
paused O
and O
gave O
an O
agitated O
look O
towards O
Marion B-PERSON
. O
His O
countenance O
had O
|
     | O
become O
pale O
, O
and O
wore O
the O
same O
expression O
as O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
of O
almost O
agonizing O
perplexity O
, O
while O
he O
|
     | O
was O
evidently O
groping O
through O
the O
darkest O
recesses O
of O
his O
memory O
for O
that O
which O
still O
eluded O
|
     | O
his O
grasp O
. O
Leaning O
his O
head O
on O
his O
hand O
, O
with O
eyes O
fixed O
on O
the O
portrait O
before O
him O
, O
Henry B-PERSON
|
     | I-PERSON
remained O
long O
in O
this O
agitating O
reverie O
, O
his O
countenance O
flushed O
by O
the O
inward O
tumult O
, O
while O
|
     | O
hunting O
through O
his O
recollection O
for O
a O
more O
defined O
shadow O
of O
that O
which O
flickered O
in O
his O
|
     | O
brain O
, O
and O
Marion B-ORG
silently O
observed O
him O
. O
She O
did O
not O
speak O
, O
she O
scarcely O
even O
breathed O
, O
for O
now O
|
     | O
it O
seemed O
to O
her O
as O
if O
some O
mystery O
were O
there O
too O
deep O
for O
her O
to O
fathom O
, O
connected O
probably O
|
     | O
with O
Henry B-PERSON
's O
early O
history O
, O
and O
a O
secret O
hope O
glimmered O
on O
her O
mind O
that O
possibly O
the O
time O
had O
|
     | O
come O
at O
last O
when O
a O
clue O
might O
be O
obtained O
to O
the O
mystery O
of O
Henry B-PERSON
's O
birth O
and O
misfortunes O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
child O
, O
whose O
portrait O
they O
had O
here O
discovered O
, O
bore O
an O
obvious O
resemblance O
to O
Henry B-PERSON
De I-PERSON
|
     | I-PERSON
Lancey I-PERSON
, O
as O
she O
first B-ORDINAL
remembered O
him O
. O
The O
very O
dress O
was O
similar O
, O
and O
all O
around O
brought O
to O
mind O
|
     | O
what O
Henry B-PERSON
had O
once O
described O
of O
his O
early O
home O
. O
It O
seemed O
to O
Marion B-PERSON
as O
if O
this O
were O
the O
very O
|
     | O
crisis O
of O
his O
existence O
, O
and O
she O
waited O
in O
silent O
hope O
, O
expecting O
that O
the O
moment O
might O
come O
, O
|
     | O
when O
he O
would O
again O
speak O
to O
tell O
her O
his O
thoughts O
  O
but O
a O
deep O
oppression O
seemed O
gathering O
over O
|
     | O
his O
spirit O
, O
he O
riveted O
his O
hands O
over O
his O
face O
, O
as O
if O
anxious O
thus O
to O
shut O
out O
the O
world O
, O
and O
|
     | O
every O
thing O
in O
it O
, O
from O
his O
shrinking O
memory O
, O
and O
there O
was O
a O
silence O
around O
like O
death O
|
     | O
itself O
. O

CHAPTER O
XLVI O
. O
| 
  | O
While O
Henry B-PERSON
continued O
thus O
entranced O
with O
perplexity O
, O
Marion B-ORG
's O
attention O
was O
gradually O
|
     | O
attracted O
by O
a O
noise O
at O
her O
side O
, O
and O
, O
looking O
suddenly O
round O
, O
she O
was O
startled O
to O
behold O
|
     | O
crouching O
in O
the O
remotest O
corner O
of O
the O
room O
, O
the O
figure O
of O
a O
human O
being O
, O
which O
filled O
her O
|
     | O
with O
horror O
and O
dismay O
, O
so O
haggard O
, O
so O
emaciated O
, O
so O
unlike O
anything O
she O
had O
ever O
looked O
upon O
|
     | O
before O
, O
that O
scarcely O
could O
she O
suppress O
a O
shriek O
of O
dismay O
. O
It O
was O
a O
face O
of O
woe O
and O
|
     | O
wretchedness O
, O
once O
seen O
never O
to O
be O
forgotten O
, O
and O
she O
had O
formerly O
seen O
it O
. O
The O
sunken O
|
     | O
temples O
, O
the O
hollow O
eyes O
, O
the O
lurid O
glare O
of O
insanity O
in O
the O
eye O
, O
and O
the O
clusters O
of O
hair O
, O
|
     | O
black O
as O
death O
, O
blown O
by O
the O
night O
- O
wind O
in O
large O
damp O
masses O
on O
his O
forehead O
, O
all O
brought O
the O
|
     | O
wretched O
Howard B-PERSON
instantaneously O
to O
her O
mind O
  O
and O
, O
grasping O
Henry B-ORG
's O
arm O
, O
with O
an O
exclamation O
of O
|
     | O
terror O
, O
she O
attempted O
to O
hurry O
with O
him O
out O
of O
the O
room O
. O
Scarcely O
, O
however O
, O
had O
she O
made O
a O
step O
|
     | O
towards O
the O
door O
, O
when O
the O
madman O
darted O
forward O
, O
and O
closed O
it O
, O
then O
wheeling O
round O
, O
he O
said O
, O
|
     | O
in O
a O
low O
, O
husky O
voice O
, O
while O
his O
strength O
seemed O
so O
subdued O
, O
that O
the O
grasp O
of O
an O
infant O
might O
|
     | O
have O
mastered O
him O
, O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
You O
have O
discovered O
me O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
escape O
! O
Be O
it O
so O
! O
' O
Welcome O

the O
rat O
said O
, O

     | O
when O
the O
trap O
fell O
down O

Here O
the O
tragedy O
began O
, O
and O
here O
let O
it O
end O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
He O
paused O
for O
several B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
, O
and O
gradually O
his O
face O
assumed O
a O
look O
of O
ungovernable O
anguish O
, O
|
     | O
while O
he O
added O
, O
in O
a O
dreary O
, O
desolate O
tone O
, O
unlike O
any O
human O
voice O
, O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
could O
weep O
for O
my O
own O
ruin,—for O
my O
sister's,—but O

is O
past O

For O
his O

purposes O
he O
|
     | O
nurtured O
every O
wild O
passion O
in O
our O
young O
blood O
. O
He O
taught O
me O
the O
mad O
ambition O
that O
was O
my O

     | O
ruin,—promised O
me O
impunity O

I O
assisted O

his O

after O

silence O
my O
outraged O

No O

The O
gibbet O

forever O

it O

a O

     | O
sullen O

deadly O
smile O

moments O

taken O
wing O
from O

in O
some O
degree O
recovered O
herself O

looked O
round O

give O
an O
alarm O

     | O
a O
step O

before O

in O
the O

     | O
shrill O

broken O

delirious O

that O
in O
an O
agony O

hurried O

forward O

A O
confused O
murmur O

a O
buzz O
of O
suppressed O
astonishment O
had O
arisen O
among O
the O

     | O
assembled O
crowd O
, O
in O
which O
were O
many O
countenances O
expressing O
strong O
fear O

wearing O
only O
an O

     | O
air O
of O
gaping O
curiosity O
, O
many O
with O
their O
hands O
clasped O

amazement O

expanding O
them O

in O
terror O

all O
listening O
with O
looks O
of O
motionless O
attention O
, O
while O
every O
eye O
was O
turned O

     | O
towards O
the O
table O
on O
which O
the O
murdered O
body O

been O
laid O

a O
deep O
silence O
ensued O
, O
of O

     | O
hushed O
expectation O

as O
if O

Henry B-ORG
glanced O
rapidly O
around O

standing O
beside O
the O
corpse O
a O
tall O
female O

whose O
aspect O

     | O
filled O
all O

surprise O

worn O

haggard O
countenance O
seemed O
cold O

rigid O
as O
the O

     | O
figure O
on O
a O
tomb O
- O
stone O

her O
cheek O

become O
overspread O
with O
a O
damp O

leaden B-GPE
paleness O
  O

     | O
while O
in O
speechless O
horror O
, O
which O
seemed O
as O
if O
it O
amounted O
almost O
to O
insanity O
, O
she O
pointed O
her O

     | O
long O
, O
ghastly O
finger O
towards O
the O
body O

glance O
swept O
for O

moment O
round O

a O
look O
of O
unutterable O
wretchedness O

at O
length O
her O
eye O
fell O
on O

now O
fixed O
an O
unshrinking O
gaze O

     | O
she O
spoke O
in O
a O
low O

hoarse O
whisper O

sounded O
with O
terrifying O
distinctness O
through O
the O

     | O
large O
old O
hall O
, O
and O
fell O
upon O
every O
ear O
with O
a O
solemnity O
and O
awfulness O
like O
the O
knell O
of O

Lord O

few O
agitated O
steps O
about O

added O

astonishment O
: O

only O
that O

She O
was O

she O
did O
at O

write O

letter O

never O

She O

     | O
there O
made O
a O
solemn O
appeal O

justice O

compassion O

claiming O
for O

the O

received O
a O
letter O
from O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
, O
announcing O
his O
intention O
|
     | O
immediately O
to O
return O
home O
. O
He O
alluded O
, O
with O
a O
degree O
of O
feeling O
which O
surprised O
and O
deeply O
|
     | O
affected O
her O
, O
to O
the O
death O
of O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
, O
and O
spoke O
of O
happy O
days B-DATE
yet O
to O
come O
, O
when O
he O
hoped O

     | O

at O
length O
, O
be O
united O

liked O

" O
In O
reading O
these O
words O
, O
Marion B-PERSON
felt O
a O
pang O
of O
melancholy O
sympathy O
|
     | O
for O
her O
brother O
, O
believing O
, O
of O
course O
, O
that O
they O
alluded O
to O
his O
friend O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
  O
|
     | O
and O
deeply O
did O
she O
deplore O
the O
grief O
he O
was O
about O
to O
suffer O
, O
when O
first B-ORDINAL
he O
should O
hear O
of O
that O
|
     | O
appalling O
event O
which O
had O
filled O
every O
heart O
with O
grief O
and O
consternation O
. O
| 
  | O
It O
was O
on O
a O
gloomy O
evening O
in O
the B-DATE
month I-DATE
of I-DATE
February I-DATE
, O
when O
the O
sun O
, O
having O
all B-DATE
day I-DATE
failed O
to O

sunk O
into O
darkness O
, O
that O
Marion B-ORG
, O
expecting O
her O
brother O
's O
return O
, O
used O
|
     | O
all O
the O
little O
ingenuity O
of O
affection O
to O
render O
his O
reception O
cheerful O
. O
The O
fire O
blazed O
|
     | O
brightly O
  O
the O
tea O
urn O
was O
on O
the O
table O
, O
and O
she O
herself O
had O
taken O
more O
than O
usual O
pains O
with O
|
     | O
her O
dress O
, O
besides O
having O
decked O
her O
face O
with O
unwonted O
smiles O
for O
the O
occasion O
. O
| 
  | O
When O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
at O
last O
arrived O
, O
there O
was O
a O
tone O
of O
unusual O
kindness O
in O
his O
manner O
to O
both O
|
     | O
Agnes B-LOC
and O
Marion B-ORG
, O
who O
were O
surprised O
by O
the O
genuine O
warmth O
with O
which O
he O
expressed O
his O
|
     | O
happiness O
on O
seeing O
them O
again O
, O
and O
at O
the O
subdued O
melancholy O
in O
his O
voice O
. O
The O
fatal O
news O
of O
|
     | O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
death O
had O
reached O
him O
on O
the O
road O
, O
and O
there O
appeared O
a O
profound O
|
     | O
solemnity O
in O
his O
manner O
when O
he O
alluded O
to O
it O
, O
more O
affecting O
than O
the O
loudest O
expressions O
of O
|
     | O
grief O
  O
but O
it O
was O
a O
subject O
on O
which O
he O
seemed O
incapable O
of O
speaking O
  O
while O
Marion B-PERSON
scarcely O
|
     | O
thought O
a O
human O
countenance O
could O
have O
expressed O
so O
much O
anguish O
. O
While O
Agnes B-LOC
preserved O
an O
|
     | O
almost O
statue O
- O
like O
silence O
, O
Marion B-PERSON
took O
her O
brother O
's O
hand O
in O
her O
own O
, O
and O
endeavored O
, O
by O
every O
|
     | O
affectionate O
endearment O
, O
to O
testify O
her O
sympathy O
, O
till O
at O
length O
he O
clasped O
her O
in O
his O
arms O
, O
|
     | O
saying O
, O
in O
accents O
almost O
choked O
with O
agitation O
, O
" O
Your O
sisterly O
kindness O
, O
Marion B-ORG
, O
has O
survived O

     | O
all O
my O
neglect O
and O
misconduct O
. O
Let O
me O
thank O
you O
for O
that O
  O
but O
could O
it O
survive O
if O
I O
were O
to O
|
     | O
tell O
you O
of O
a O
cruel O
and O
heartless O
treachery O

" O
| 
  | O
" O
It O
can O
survive O
anything O

everything O

whispered O
Marion B-ORG
, O
earnestly O
. O
" O
Say O
nothing O
that O

     | O
distresses O
you O

must O
not O
only O
think O
of O
it O
for O
ever O

but O
show O
my O
regret O
by O
telling O
you O
all O
, O

|
     | O
replied O
he O
, O
in O
a O
tone O
of O
deep O
, O
concentrated O
feeling O
. O
" O

not O
now O

not O
yet O

could O
not O

     | O
bear O
to O
do O
so O
in O
the O
full O
tide O
of O
our O
happiness O
at O

| 
  | O
The O
color O
rushed O
over O
Marion B-ORG
's O
countenance O
, O
and O
vanished O
as O
rapidly O
again O
  O
but O
her O
eyes O
, O

     | O
which O
had O
been O
fixed O
on O
those O
of O
Sir O

with O
sparkling O
affection O

now O
fell O
sadly O
to O
the O

     | O
ground O
, O
while O
she O
made O
no O
reply O
, O
evidently O
trying O
to O
avoid O
her O
brother O

notice O

seemed O

bent O
on O
reading O
her O
thoughts O

Marion B-PERSON

in O
tremulous O
accents O

" O

I O

There O
was O
a O
look O
of O
joyous O
emotion O
in O
the O
countenance O
of O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
as O
he O
spoke O

which O
made O

     | O
the O
heart O
of O
Marion B-ORG
leap O
to O
her O
very O
lips O
with O
agitation O
, O
while O
in O
broken O
and O
hurried O
accents O

     | O
he O
continued O
, O

recent O
dangerous O
illness O
abroad O

I O
was O
attended O
by O
the O
most O
inestimable O
of O

friends O
  O
to O
describe O
how O
the O
slow O
progress O
of O
my O

left O
me O
leisure O
for O
the O
counsels O

     | O
conversation O
of O
the O
best O
of O

say O
how O
the O
death O
of O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny I-PERSON
has O
overawed O
and O

     | O
afflicted O
me O

the O
gloss O
from O
my O

the O

A O
bright O
, O
quick O
flush O
passed O
across O
Marion B-ORG
's O
cheek O
, O
and O
a O
bewildering O
hope O
darted O
into O
her O

     | O
mind O
, O
when O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
smilingly O
added O
, O
with O
a O
thrilling O
tremor O
still O
in O
his O
voice O
, O

" O
A O
stranger O

myself O

he O
come O
up O
? O

too O
much O
agitated O

Scarcely O
had O
her O
brother O
left O
the O
room O
, O
before O
Marion B-ORG
heard O
a O
light O
, O
springing O
step O
on O
the O
|
     | O
stairs O
. O
The O
door O
was O
flung O
open O
  O
and O
if O
joy O
ever O
killed O
, O
it O
would O
have O
been O
now O
, O
when O
Marion B-PERSON
, O

     | O
with O
almost O
incredulous O
astonishment O
, O
again O
beheld O
Richard B-PERSON
Granville I-PERSON
  O
his O
features O
lighted O
up O
|
     | O
by O
the O
smile O
of O
former O
days O
  O
his O
eyes O
radiant O
with O
joy O
, O
and O
his O
countenance O
almost O
convulsed O
|
     | O
with O
agitation O
, O
while O
, O
giving O
an O
exclamation O
of O
rapturous O
delight O
, O
he O
presented O
himself O
before O

     | O
her O
. O
| 
  | O
If O
Marion B-PERSON
's O
life O
had O
depended O
on O
her O
speaking O
a O
word O
, O
she O
could O
not O
for O
some O
moments O
have O
|
     | O
uttered O
it O
  O
but O
there O
is O
a O
silent O
eloquence O
in O
deep O
emotion O
, O
more O
powerful O
than O
language O
  O
and O
, O
|
     | O
giddy O
with O
excessive O
astonishment O
, O
tears O
and O
smiles O
seemed O
to O
struggle O
for O
the O
mastery O
in O
her O
|
     | O
countenance O
, O
like O
the O
summer B-DATE
light O
and O
shade O
upon O
an O
aspen O
tree O
. O
| 
  | O
All O
was O
mutual O
confidence O
, O
and O
mutual O
affection O
now O
, O
while O
Richard B-PERSON
Granville I-PERSON
rapidly O
, O
and O
|
     | O
almost O
incoherently O
, O
conveyed O
to O
Marion B-ORG
's O
heart O
the O
surpassing O
felicity O
of O
his O
own O
, O
telling O
her O
|
     | O
how O
the B-TIME
long I-TIME
hours I-TIME
of O
his O
absence O
had O
each O
and O
all O
of O
them O
been O
counted O
over O
with O
unimaginable O
|
     | O
impatience O
  O
that O
, O
she O
had O
never O
been O
a O
moment O
absent O
from O
his O
thoughts O
, O
and O
that O
, O
having O
seized O

     | O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
instant O
to O
hasten O
to O
his O
happiness O
, O
he O
had O
now O
returned O
to O
claim O
his O
promised O
bride O
, O

     | O
and O
in O
the O
sight O
of O
heaven O
and O
earth O
, O
to O
dedicate O
to O
her O
all O
his O
earthly O
affections O
— O
to O
make O
her O

     | O
his O
own O
forever O
. O
| 
  | O
With O
a O
deep O
sob O
of O
gratified O
emotion O
, O
Marion B-ORG
listened O
  O
her O
feelings O
were O
strained O
to O
the O
|
     | O
uttermost O
  O
but O
she O
frankly O
received O
all O
his O
joyful O
protestations O
of O
unchanged O
and O
unchangeable O
|
     | O
attachment O
, O
and O
attempted O
not O
to O
conceal O
her O
own O
, O
saying O
, O
in O
low O
, O
tremulous O
accents O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
|
     | O
she O
could O
command O
her O
voice O
to O
speak O
, O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
think O
the O
more O
of O
myself O
for O
being O
loved O
by O
you O
. O
It O
will O
take O
a O
life O

time O
to O
testify O
how O

deeply O
I O
value O
your O

be O
nothing O

be O
expressed O
in O
words O

continued O
Richard B-PERSON
, O
in O

     | O
accents O
of O
the O
deepest O
tenderness O
. O
" O
But O
let O
future O
years O

my O
Marion B-ORG

speak O
for O

It O

     | O
that O

of O
