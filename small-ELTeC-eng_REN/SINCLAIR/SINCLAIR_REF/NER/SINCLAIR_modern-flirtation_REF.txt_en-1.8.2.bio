PREFACE O
. O
It O
was O
the O
rule O
of O
a O
celebrated O
equestrian O
, O
which O
might O
be O
adapted O
to O
authors O
as O
well O
as O
to O
horsemen O
, O
that O
every O
one O
should O
ride O
as O
if O
he O
expected O
to O
be O
thrown O
, O
and O
drive O
as O
if O
he O
expected O
to O
be O
upset O

Impunity O
in O
publishing O
, O
far O
from O
rendering O
an O
author O
presumptuous O
, O
should O
tend O
rather O
to O
increase O
his O
timidity O
, O
the O
danger O
being O
greater O
always O
of O
venturing O
too O
much O
, O
than O
of O
hazarding O
too O
little O
| | O
and O
the O
more O
cause O
any O
writer O
has O
to O
feel O
grateful O
for O
the O
lenient O
judgment O
of O
an O
enlightened O
public O
, O
the O
more O
circumspect O
should O
he O
become O
, O
not O
to O
trespass O
by O
an O
obtrusive O
reappearance O
on O
that O
notice O
which O
has O
already O
perhaps O
been O
, O
as O
in O
respect O
to O
the O
author O
herself O
, O
beyond O
all O
expectation O
favorable O
. O
An O
old O
proverb O
declares O
that O
" O
a O
goose O
- O
quill O
is O
more O
powerful O
than O
a O
lion's O
claw O
, O
" O
and O
authors O
have O
been O
called O
" O
keepers O
of O
the O
public O
conscience O
| | O
" O
but O
no O
influence O
is O
perhaps O
so O
extensive O
as O
that O
exercised O
by O
what O
is O
termed O
" O
light O
reading O
, O
" O
which O
has O
now O
in O
a O
great O
measure O
superseded O
public O
places O
and O
theatrical O
entertainments O

affording O
a O
popular O
resource O
with O
which O
the O
busiest O
men O
relax O
their O
hard O
- O
working O
minds O
, O
and O
the O
idlest O
occupy O
their O
idleness O
. O
It O
becomes O
a O
deep O
responsibility O
, O
therefore O
, O
of O
which O
the O
author O
trusts O
she O

ever O

duly O

claim O

may O
be O
intermingled O
, O
and O
the O
cause O
of O
sound O
religion O
and O
morality O
supported O
, O
for O
her O
feelings O
are O
best O
expressed O
in O
the O
words O
of O
the O
poet O
, O
" O
If O

lately O
promoted O
to O
a O
new O

in O
the O

since O

attainments O

their O
pens O
occasionally O
to O
wander O

the O
general O

scarcely O

encouragement O
enough O
soon O

induce O
historians O

biographers O
to O
dip O
the O
pen O
of O
veracity O
into O
the O
ink O

it O
is O
perhaps O
to O

public O

When O
such O

are O
really O
true O

they O
convey O
very O
important O

more O
popular O

a O
dry O

If O

considered O

portrait O

In O
writing O
a O
story O
of O
domestic O
life O
, O
it O
is O
singular O
to O
reflect O
how O
commonly O
men O
are O
remembered O
by O
their O
eccentricities O
, O
and O
loved O

very O
faults O

while O
the O
most O
difficult O
task O
in O
fiction O
is O
, O
to O
describe O
amiable O
persons O
so O
as O
to O
render O
them O
at O
all O
interesting O
and O
not O
utterly O
insipid O
. O
Probably O
it O
may O
be O
for O
this O
reason O
that O
modern O
writers O
too O
frequently O
, O
instead O
of O
describing O
the O
principles O
which O
ennoble O
human O
nature O
, O
and O
the O
sentiments O
which O
embellish O
life O
, O
have O
painted O
in O
vivid O
coloring O
, O
all O
that O
is O
low O
, O
mean O
, O
and O
vicious O
in O
society O
, O
introducing O
their O
readers O
into O
scenes O
, O
the O
reality O
of O
which O
would O
be O
shunned O
with O
abhorrence O
, O
and O
flinging O
over O
vice O
such O
a O
mantle O
of O
genius O
as O
converts O
the O
deformities O
of O
society O
into O
subjects O
of O
interest O
— O
unfortunately O
even O
of O
sympathy O
. O
Were O
authors O
obliged O
hereafter O
, O
to O
live O
with O
the O
characters O
they O
create O
, O
how O
few O
would O
desire O
to O
share O
with O
them O
in O
such O
a O
world O
! O
Even O
where O
the O
intention O
is O
to O
represent O
an O
attractive O
character O
, O
it O
seldom O
appears O
as O
one O
which O
could O
be O
an O
agreeable O
acquisition O
to O
any O
family O
circle O
| | O
and O
in O
works O
of O
sentiment O
or O
feeling O
, O
nothing O
is O
less O
successfully O
pictured O
than O
a O
generous O
and O
refined O
attachment O
, O
fitted O
to O
survive O
every O
trial O
or O
vicissitude O
of O
existence O
, O
between O
those O
who O
are O
to O
love O
each O
other O
for O
ever O
. O
Few O
stories O
could O
be O
written O
, O
if O
lovers O
in O
a O
romance O
acted O
with O
the O
slightest O
degree O
of O
confidence O
or O
esteem O
| | O
but O
such O
narratives O
are O
generally O
founded O
on O
a O
teazing O
succession O
of O
narrow O
- O
minded O
suspicions O
, O
and O
unwarrantable O
concealments O
on O
the O
part O
of O
heroes O
and O
heroines O
, O
who O
condemn O
each O
other O
unheard O
, O
and O
go O
through O
volumes O
of O
heart O
- O
breaking O
alienation O
, O
enough O
to O
terminate O
life O
itself O
, O
rather O
than O
ask O
the O
most O
simple O
explanation O
, O
while O
the O
reader O
cannot O
but O
feel O
a O
certain O
conviction O
in O
closing O
the O
last O
page O
, O
that O
an O
engagement O
begun O
with O
cavilling O
jealousies O
and O
painful O
recriminations O
, O
can O
never O
become O
productive O
of O
lasting O
peace O
. O
The O
mothers O
and O
daughters O
in O
fashionable O
society O
have O
of O
late O
been O
so O
harshly O
stigmatized O
by O
the O
press O
, O
that O
it O
seems O
as O
if O
some O
authors O
had O
taken O
up O
a O
porcupine's O
quill O
dipped O
in O
gall O
, O
to O
ridicule O
their O
conduct O
and O
motives O
, O
while O
not O
a O
pen O
has O
yet O
been O
drawn O
from O
the O
scabbard O
, O
nor O
a O
drop O
of O
ink O
spilled O
in O
their O
justification O
| | O
but O
the O
weight O
of O
censure O
might O
become O
greatly O
lightened O
by O
being O
more O
equitably O
divided O
among O
all O
who O
are O
entitled O
to O
carry O
a O
share O
, O
and O
in O
these O
volumes O
an O
endeavor O
is O
made O
to O
rectify O
the O
balance O
more O
justly O
, O
though O
with O
what O
success O
remains O
to O
be O
discovered O
by O
the O
author O
herself O

in O
immense O

putting O
a O
handkerchief O
to O
his O

looked O
far O
out O

He O
leaned O
forward O
so O
long O
, O
however O
, O
that O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
kindly O
but O
vehemently O
remonstrated O
on O
the O
danger O

in O
so O
much O
pain O
, O
to O
the O

air O

enumerated O
a O
whole O
host O
of O
remedies O

decayed O
teeth O

suggested O
the O
great O
comfort O

convenience O
of O
having O
the O
offender O
extracted O
by O
Hutchins S-PERSON
, O

ended O
by O
hoping O

dinner O

" O

Mr. O
De B-PERSON

watched O
him O
with O
a O
look O

respectful O
interest O

which O
ended O
in O
his O
turning O
away O
after O

disappeared O

heaving O
a O
deep O
sigh O

a O
cloud O
of O
care O
darkened O
on O
his O
forehead O
, O

a O
look O

Sir O

frequently O
postponed O

considered O

in O
hopes O

still O
Sir O

ate O
his O

in O
long O

at O

II O

The O
two S-CARDINAL
most O
dashing O
, O
bold O
, O
and O
mischievous O
boys O
at O
Eton S-ORG
during O
their O
day O
, O
had O
formerly O
been O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
Dunbar E-PERSON
and O
Louis B-PERSON
De I-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
, O
who O
astonished O
the O
weak O
minds O
of O
masters O
and O
pupils O
, O
by O
the O
strange O
and O
startling O
invention O
displayed O
in O
their O
exploits O
, O
as O
well O
as O
by O
the O
ingenuity O
with O
which O
both O
got O
safely O
out O
of O
every O
threatening O
predicament O
, O
and O
the O
sly O
humor O
or O
cunning O
with O
which O
they O
frequently O
shifted O
the O
disgrace O
, O
or O
even O
the O
punishment O
, O
of O
their O
offences O
, O
on O
others O
who O
deserved O
it O
less O
, O
or O
perhaps O
not O
at O
all O
. O
Invariably O
at O
the O
head O
of O
every O
mad O
exploit O
, O
or O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
every O
secret O
design O
, O
how O
they O
could O
possibly O
have O
escaped O
being O
expelled O
was O
a O
frequent O
topic O
of O
subsequent O
wonder O
among O
their O
contemporaries O
in O
the O
classes O
| | O
but O
their O
delight O
was O
to O
run O
as O
near O
the O
wind O
as O
possible O
, O
and O
still O
to O
display O
their O
skilful O
pilotage O
by O
baffling O
justice O
, O
and O
evading O
the O
utmost O
rigor O
of O
the O
law O
, O
while O
always O
ready O
rather O
to O
do O
harm O
than O
to O
do O
nothing O
. O
When O
very O
young O
, O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
enterprising O
friends O
, O
both O
since O
gazetted O
into O
the O
15th S-ORDINAL
Light O
Huzzars O
, O
had O
shown O
an O
early O
predilection O
for O
military O
life O
, O
by O
frequently O
escaping O
to O
the O
neighbouring O
barracks O
, O
assisted O
by O
a O
ladder O
of O
rope O
on O
which O
they O
descended O
every B-TIME
night E-TIME
from O
the O
windows O
. O
A O
gay O
, O
joyous O
reception O
invariably O
awaited O
these O
lively O
boys O
at O
the O
mess O
- O
table O
, O
where O
they O
sung O
many O
a O
jovial O
song O
, O
and O
cracked O
many O
a O
merry O
jest O
over O
their O
claret O
, O
till O
, O
after O
some O
hours O
spent O
in O
rapturous O
festivity O
, O
they O
stole O
silently O
back O
within O
bounds O
, O
and O
were O
re-admitted O
at O
the O
window O
, O
by O
their O
respective O
fags O
, O
who O
had O
received O
orders O
, O
under O
pain O
of O
death O
, O
to O
keep O
awake O
and O
answer O
their O
signals O
for O
the O
ladder O
by O
instantly O
lowering O
it O
. O
The O
spirits O
of O
both O
these O
young O
companions O
were O
more O
like O
the O
effect O
of O
intoxication O
, O
than O
mere O
sober O
enjoyment O
| | O
and O
, O
on O
one S-CARDINAL
occasion O
, O
they O
set O
the O
table O
in O
a O
roar O
, O
by O
having O
a O
rivalship O
which O
would O
best O
imitate O
the O
gradual O
progress O
of O
becoming O
tipsy O
, O
though O
drinking O
nothing O
but O
cold O
water O
| | O
in O
which O
exhibition O
they O
showed O
so O
much O
talent O
for O
mimicry O
, O
taking O
off O
the O
surrounding O
officers O
before O
their O
faces O
, O
and O
making O
so O
many O
home O
- O
thrusts O
and O
personal O
remarks O
, O
that O
the O
scene O
was O
never O
afterwards O
forgotten O
in O
the O
regiment O
. O
On O
another O
occasion O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
caused O
himself O
to O
be O
placed O
in O
a O
coffin O
, O
stolen O
from O
the O
undertakers O
, O
and O
was O
carried O
through O
the O
barracks O
by O
his O
companions O
, O
who O
made O
paper O
trumpets O
with O
which O
they O
played O
the O
dead O
march O
in O
Saul S-PERSON
, O
while O
all O
the O
sentries O
saluted O
as O
they O
passed O
. O
Such O
juvenile O
exploits O
in O
the O
dawn O
of O
life O
were O
now O
the O
subject O
of O
many O
a O
laughing O
reminiscence O
, O
and O
had O
been O
followed O
by O
others O
on O
a O
more O
extended O
scale O
and O
of O
more O
matured O
enterprise O
, O
at O
Mr. O
Brownlow's S-PERSON
, O
a O
private O
tutor O
, O
where O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
young O
men O
afterwards O
distinguished O
themselves O
in O
a O
way O
not O
easily O
to O
be O
forgotten O
, O
causing O
their O
better O
disciplined O
companions O
to O
wonder O
, O
though O
in O
very O
few O
instances O
to O
admire O
. O
In O
the O
favorite O
aristocratic O
achievements O
of O
driving O
stage O
- O
coaches O
, O
breaking O
lamps O
, O
wringing O
off O
knockers O
, O
assaulting O
watchmen O
, O
with O
other O
fistic O
and O
pugilistic O
exploits O
, O
they O
were O
nearly O
unrivalled O
| | O
and O
occasionally O
their O
genius O
had O
soared O
into O
an O
extraordinary O
display O
of O
dexterity O
, O
in O
transposing O
the O
signs O
suspended O
over O
shops O
, O
and O
in O
filching O
silk O
handkerchiefs O
from O
the O
pockets O
of O
their O
friends O
, O
merely O
as O
amateurs O
, O
but O
still O
the O
deed O
was O
done O
, O
and O
the O
laugh O
raised O
literally O
at O
the O
expense O
of O
the O
sufferer O
, O
as O
the O
plunder O
was O
retained O
to O
be O
a O
future O
trophy O
of O
success O
. O
Each O
successive O
stage O
of O
their O
youth O
, O
in O
short O
, O
supplied O
an O
inexhaustible O
fund O
of O
standing O
jests O
and O
lively O
anecdotes O
, O
the O
wit O
of O
which O
mainly O
consisted O
in O
their O
mischief O
, O
while O
they O
betrayed O
an O
utter O
recklessness O
about O
the O
opinions O
or O
the O
feelings O
of O
others O
, O
till O
at O
length O
the O
patience O
of O
their O
unfortunate O
private O
tutor O
was O
so O
completely O
exhausted O
that O
he O
gave O
them O
a O
secret O
hint O
to O
withdraw O
, O
which O
they O
accordingly O
lost O
no O
time O
in O
preparing O
to O
do O
, O
but O
not O
till O
they O
had O
enjoyed O
a O
very O
characteristic O
revenge O

When O
Mr. O

taken O
a O
party O

with O
him O
one B-TIME
evening E-TIME
to O
the O
theatre O

Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
suddenly O
discharged O
from O
the O
gallery O
the O
whole O
contents O
of O
a O
prodigious O
bag O
of O
flour O
, O

powdered O
all O
the O
heads O

faces O
, O
and O
coats O
, O
in O
the O
pit O
, O
perfectly O
white O
, O
and O
caused O
an O
uproar O
of O
anger O
and O
of O
irresistible O
laughter O
throughout O
the O
house O

evening O
Louis B-PERSON

, O
as O
a O
farewell O
frolic O

abstracted O
a O

from O
the O

having O
equipped O
it O
in O
the O

of O
Mr. O

hung O
it O
from O

where O
a O
panic O
- O
struck O

was O
speedily O
assembled O
by O
the O
alarming O
report O
that O
the O
reverend O

committed O
suicide O
. O
A O
strict O
investigation O
took O
place O
respecting O
the O
authors O

these O
unpardonable O
tricks O

but O
, O
though O
suspicion O
fell O
at O
once O
upon O
the O
real O
culprits O
, O

the O
circumstantial O
evidence O
against O

seemed O
irresistibly O
strong O
, O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
argued O
his O
own O
cause O
with O
so O
much O
skill O
and O
vivacity O
, O
while O
De B-PERSON

from O

soon O

both O

at O
Dublin S-GPE

De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
and O
Sir O

had O
but O
one S-CARDINAL
companion O
whom O
they O
acknowledged O
as O
their O
equal O

all O

jealously O

Richard B-PERSON

had O

to O
follow O
the O
impulse O
of O
natural O
feeling O
as O
well O
as O
of O
principle O

and O
he O
out O

did O
the O
very O
wishes O

while O
no O
one O
excelled O
him O
in O
all O
the O
manly O
exercises O
suited O
to O
his O
early O

His O
countenance O
was O
illuminated O
with O
an O
expression O
of O
intellectual O
energy O
, O
at O
times O
almost O
sublime O

there O

irresistibly O

Brave O

he O
entered O
with O
eagerness O
into O
all O
the O
offensive O
recreations O
of O
his O
companions O

no O

excelled O
him O
in O
riding O

, O
while O
he O
was O
the O
best O
shot O
in O
his O
own O

he O
firmly O
declined O

young O
Granville S-PERSON
said O
all O
that O
eloquence O

affection O
could O
dictate O

to O
point O
out O
how O
dangerous O

dishonorable O
was O
the O
course O
on O
which O
he O
seemed O
about O

enter O

in O
vain O
, O
for O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
finished O
the O
discussion O
by O
offering O
to O
bet O
him O

would O
not O

" O

While O
the O
very O
presence O
of O
young O
Granville S-PERSON
in O
the O
room O
, O
with O
his O
riotous O
young O
associates O
, O
seemed O
as O
if O

held O
up O
a O
glass O

their O
mind's O
eye O

the O

course O

yet O
Richard B-PERSON
Granville E-PERSON
abhorred O

Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON

De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON

declared O
he O

" O
too O
clever O

too O
good O

and O
unavoidable O
circumstances O
afterwards O
combined O
to O
estrange O
the O
young O
men O
still O
more O

A O
law O

suit O
had O
been O
going O
on O
almost O
since O
the O
period O

their O
birth O

conducted O
in O
an O
amicable O
way O
by O
their O
guardians O

in O
which O
the O
interests O
of O
all O
three S-CARDINAL

so O
deeply O

the O
case O
so O
exceedingly O

that O
years O
passed O
on O

during O
which O
the O
youths O

all O
grown O

which O
was O
given O
to O
Dunbar S-PERSON

De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON

the O
subject O

an O
angry O

rancour O
against O

amiable O

A O

no O

had O
fifty B-DATE

Marquis S-PERSON

to O
whom O
young O

was O
now O
heir O
presumptive O

but O
Mr. O
Dunbar S-PERSON
having O
, O
it O
was O
conjectured O
, O
entertained O
some O
suspicion O
that O
the O
title O
deeds O
were O
not O
perfectly O
valid O
, O
as O
an O
entail O
had O
been O
discovered O
afterwards O
, O
by O
which O
it O
was O
generally O
thought O
that O
the O
land O
must O
be O
restored O
to O
the O
original O
owner O
, O
he O
hastily O
and O
most O
unfairly O
sold O
the O
property O
to O
the O
late O
Mr. O
Granville S-PERSON
for O
£ O
350,000 S-MONEY
, O
and O
dying O
intestate O
, O
after O
having O
lost O
nearly O
the O
whole O
sum O
in O
a O
mining O
speculation O
, O
it O
could O
not O
be O
proved O
whether O
Sir O
Patrick's S-PERSON
father O
had O
acted O
as O
an O
executor O
for O
the O
deceased O
or O
not O

so O
as O
to O
render O
himself O
responsible O

his O
debts O

and O
liable O
to O
refund O
the O
sum O
paid O
by O
Mr. O
Granville S-PERSON

Thus O
, O
whether O
the O
entail O
held O
good O
, O

carried O
the O
estate O
back O
to O
Lord B-GPE
Doncaster E-GPE
, O
or O
whether O
it O

legally O
broken O

so O
as O
to O
entitle O
the O
Granville S-PERSON
family O

keep O
it O

or O
whether O
, O
if O
it O
were O
refunded O

the O
price O
could O
be O
claimed O
from O
the O
heirs O
of O
Mr. O
Dunbar S-PERSON
, O
still O
continued O
a O
mystery O
never O
apparently O
to O
be O
solved O
. O
For O
many O
generations O
past O
, O
the O
ancient O
Marquisate O
of O
Doncaster S-GPE
had O
been O
inherited O
by O
a O
succession O
of O
only O
sons O
, O
all O
strict O
Papists O
, O
who O
had O
each O
in O
his O
turn O
been O
reckoned O
by O
the O
next O
heirs O
exceedingly O
sickly O
and O
unpromising O
, O
but O
still O
the O
wonder O
grew O
, O
for O
not O
one O
had O
ever O
died O
, O
till O
he O
left O
a O
substitute O
in O
regular O
rotation O
, O
to O
supply O
the O
vacancy O
which O
he O
created O
himself O

and O
a O
long O
train O
of O
minorities O
in O
the O
family O
had O
caused O
the O
accumulation O
of O
wealth O

property O
to O
be O
enormous O

when O
the O
present O
proprietor O
succeeded O
fifty B-DATE
years E-DATE
before O
our O
story O
commences O
. O
Nothing O
could O
exceed O
his O
own O
astonishment O
at O
the O
unembarrassed O
magnificence O
of O
the O
fortune O
, O
of O
which O
he O
most O
unexpectedly O
found O
himself O
in O
possession O
, O
as O
his O
father O
had O
been O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
concealing O
the O
amount O
of O
his O
own O
income O
, O
and O
allowing O
his O
heir O
rather O
less O

nothing O

saying O
, O
that O
as O
he O
himself O
had O
never O
had O
anything O
to O
eat O
till O
he O
had O
no O
teeth O
to O
eat O
with O

he O
was O
resolved O
that O
his O
successor O
should O
be O
similarly O
treated O
. O
In O
pursuance O
of O
this O
plan O
, O
the O
old O
nobleman O
even O
on O

death O

the O

about O

scarcely O

and O
recommended O
him O
to O
live O
in O
future O
with O
the O
most O
penurious O
economy O
. O
When O
the O
will O
was O
opened O
, O
finding O
to O
his O
unutterable O
joy O
, O
that O
he O
had O
merely O
been O
played O
upon O
by O
the O
old O
humorist O

who O
, O
in O
reality O
left O
him O
£ O
40,000 S-MONEY
per O

clear O
, O
so O
great O
was O
Lord O
Doncaster's S-PERSON
surprise O
, O
that O
he O
declared O
his O
good O
fortune O
at O
the O
time O
to O
be O
" O
almost O
incredible O

" O
and O
it O
might O
have O
been O
supposed O
, O
that O
he O
never O
afterwards O
completely O
believed O
it O
, O
as O
his O
personal O
expenses O
were O
always O
in O
a O
style O
more O
suited O
to O
the O
old O
Lord's S-PERSON
threat O
than O
his O
performance O
, O
and O
he O
became O
a O
fresh O
instance O
of O
what O
may O
be O
so O
often O
remarked O
, O
that O
the O
most O
extravagant O
heirs O
in O
expectancy O
become O
the O
most O
avaricious O
in O
possession O

There O
was O
one S-CARDINAL
singular O
peculiarity O
in O
the O
settlements O
of O
Lord O

family O
, O
that O
so O
long O
as O

the O
ancestor O
who O
had O
inserted O
this O

rather O

the O

taken O
advantage O

on O
so O
large O

no O

misfortune O

a O
man O

The O

shy O

arbitrary O
beyond O

avaricious O
about O

good O

the O
very O
worst O
female O

when O

the O

Mr. O

, O
the O
wealthy O

in O

it O
became O
a O
favorite O
day O

dream O
with O
the O
old O

that O
his O

be O
educated O
for O

while O
to O
this O
end O
he O
tried O
his O
utmost O
power O
of O
conciliation O
with O
the O
maiden O
sister O
of O
Mr. O
Howard B-PERSON
Smytheson E-PERSON
, O
to O
whose O
care O
the O
young O

had O
been O
consigned O

hoping O
that O
thus O
all O
the O
amputated O
limbs O

his O
vast O
property O
might O
yet O
be O
reunited O
in O
their O
pristine O
magnitude O

to O
which O
very O
desirable O
end O
he O
thenceforth O
directed O
his O
whole O
conversations O
with O
young O
De B-PERSON

to O
whom O
he O
more O
than O
hinted O

were O
the O

about O
this O
marriage O

his O
own O
will O
after O
death O
would O
be O
found O
very O
different O
from O
what O
his O
nephew O
probably O
anticipated O

wished O

The O
private O
vices O
of O
Lord O

had O
been O
so O
very O
private O
, O
that O
though O
much O
was O
suspected O

little O
could O
be O
known O

he O
had O
few O
visible O

personal O
expenses O
, O

no O
imaginable O
outlet O
for O
his O
fortune O

he O
invariably O
spent O
all O
his O
income O
, O

considerably O
more O

being O
one S-CARDINAL

seen O
who O
excite O
the O
wonder O

speculation O
of O

unaccountably O
frittering O

royal O
splendor O

without O
any O

Wearied O
of O
the O
world O

in O

he O
had O
nothing O
more O

short O
with O
the O

a O

Lord O
Doncaster's S-PERSON
life O
was O
indeed O
a O
mere O
heartless O
pageant O
of O
mean O
ostentation O

fretful O
pride O

sternly O
insulated O
in O
a O
state O
of O
solitary O
old O

bachelor O
despotism O

absorbed O
in O
himself O
to O
a O
degree O
which O
no O
ordinary O
mind O
could O
conceive O

comprehend O

Encumbered O
with O
so O
many O
unoccupied O
hours O
, O
it O
was O
a O
subject O
of O
as O
much O
wonder O
how O
he O
disposed O
of O
his O
superfluous O
time O
, O
as O
of O
his O
superfluous O
fortune O

but O
he O
settled O
that O
question O

by O
remarking O
one O
day O
to O
his O
nephew O
, O
that O
" O
the O
great O
business O

" O
Like O
all O
parsimonious O

Lord O

could O
not O
endure O

hear O

to O
over O

consequently O
he O
amused O
himself O
occasionally O

patiently O
heard O

an O

explanation O

cowered O
sometimes O
before O
the O
flood O

invectives O

with O

he O
relieved O
his O
heart O
by O
speaking O

his O

he O
seemed O
to O
cherish O

he O
called O

at O
whatever O
expense O

could O

At O
a O
very O
early O
age O
, O
he O
was O
already O
a O
veteran O
in O
the O
world O
and O
its O
ways O

for O

stood O
" O
alone O
in O
his O
glory O
, O
" O
the O
most O
admired O
, O
courted O
, O
and O
idolized O
of O
mankind O
, O
a O
perfect O
adept O
in O
all O
the O
arts O
of O
rendering O
himself O
agreeable O
in O
society O
, O
and O
possessing O
many O
pleasant O
qualities O
, O
but O
none O
that O
were O
valuable O
. O
During O
a O
gay O
career O
of O
dissipation O
and O
frivolity O
, O
he O
had O
entered O
with O
successive O
eagerness O
on O
a O
thousand S-CARDINAL
flirtations O
, O
though O
he O
always O
forgot O
to O
marry O
in O
the O
end O
, O
while O
his O
heart O
, O
like O
a O
phœnix O
, O
was O
frequently O
consumed O
, O
yet O
never O
destroyed O
, O
and O
always O
ready O
at O
the O
service O
of O
any O
young O
lady O
, O
with O
youth O
, O
beauty O
, O
and O
accomplishments O
enough O
to O
excite O
his O
temporary O
interest O

of O
opinion O
, O
that O
, O

ought O
speedily O

De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
openly O
avowed O
the O
impossibility O
of O
marrying O
while O
Lord O
Doncaster S-PERSON
survived O
, O
and O
jocularly O
remarked O
, O
that O
it O
would O
be O
a O
pity O
prematurely O
to O
cut O
off O
the O
hopes O
of O
his O
hundred B-CARDINAL

one E-CARDINAL
Scotch S-NORP
cousins O
, O
who O
lived O
, O
like O
Ernest B-PERSON

, O
on O
the O
hope O
, O
that O
if O
his O
neck O
were O
broken O
at O
Melton S-PERSON
, O
his O
succession O
might O

be O

up O

amongst O
them O

and O
to O
the O
friendly O
inquiries O
of O
his O
many O
relatives O
, O
he O
frequently O
replied O
with O
a O
condoling O
look O
, O
that O
he O
and O
his O
uncle O
were O
both O
" O
hopelessly O
well O
. O
" O
Lord O
Doncaster S-PERSON
was O
not O
even O
yet O
, O
by O
any O
means O
, O
so O
great O
a O
Methusalemite O
in O
age O
, O
nor O
so O
weighed O
down O
by O
infirmities O
, O
as O
his O
lively O
nephew O
chose O
among O
the O
mothers O

intimate O
acquaintance O

represent O

young O

piqued O

affronted O

were O
actually O
ill O
- O
natured O
enough O
to O
hint O
, O
that O
Lord O

was O
still O
almost O
young O

almost O
handsome O

They O
had O
even O
been O
so O
malicious O
as O
to O
insinuate O
, O
that O
his O
Lordship O
might O
possibly O
have O
a O
genius O
for O
marrying O
his O
house O

keeper O
, O
almost O
the O
only O
respectable O
female O
who O
ever O
crossed O
his O
threshold O

Mrs. O
Fireland's S-PERSON
very O
mature O
age O
, O

very O
antiquated O
dress O
, O
shewed O
how O
completely O
she O
must O
have O
given O
up O
that O
point O

and O
even O
her O
desire O
to O
please O
him O
in O
her O
own O
department O
, O
became O
every O
hour O
so O
increasingly O
difficult O
, O
and O
was O
attended O
with O
failures O
and O
disappointments O
so O
unforeseen O
and O
unaccountable O
, O
that O
the O
good O
woman O
often O
shook O
her O
head O
ominously O
, O
in O
alluding O
to O
his O
Lordship's O
numerous O
whims O
, O
saying O
, O
in O
a O
confidential O
under O
tone O
, O
which O
seemed O
to O
mean O
more O
than O
met O
the O
ear O
, O
to O
the O
steward O
, O
" O

" O

certainly O

had O
become O

late B-DATE

more O
particular O
than O
ever O

art O
of O
doing O
no O
wrong O
in O
the O
estimation O

Lord O
Doncaster S-PERSON

and O
the O
respect O
which O
he O
withheld O
from O
all O
mankind O
, O
was O
concentrated O
to O
an O
immeasurable O
degree O
on O
the B-PERSON
Abbe I-PERSON
Mordaunt E-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
the B-PERSON
Cardinal I-PERSON
Wolsey E-PERSON
of O
Kilmarnock B-ORG
Abbey E-ORG

Beaujolie B-FAC
Castle E-FAC
. O
Proud O
, O
overbearing O
, O
harsh O
, O
and O
arbitrary O
, O
he O
ruled O
over O
the O
house O
, O
the O
purse O
, O
and O
even O
the O
will O
of O
his O
patron O

with O
despotic O
and O
unlimited O
sway O
. O
Men O
are O
generally O
advanced O
in O
years S-DATE
before O
the O
passions O
and O
feelings O
have O
stamped O
their O
indelible O
traces O
, O
like O
the O
impression O
of O
a O
seal O

which O
becomes O
permanent O
only O
after O
the O
wax O
has O
began O
to O
cool O
| | O
but O
in O
every O
feature O
of O
the O
Abbe's S-NORP
countenance O
, O
might O
now O
be O
seen O
the O
evidences O
of O
a O
gloomy O
, O
severe O
, O
and O
almost O
ferocious O
temper O
, O
yet O
never O
was O
there O
a O
greater O
triumph O
of O
art O
over O
nature O
, O
than O
in O
the O
skill O
with O
which O
he O
adapted O
his O
looks O
and O
conversation O
to O
the O
taste O
or O
caprice O
of O
those O
whom O
it O
was O
his O
interest O
to O
govern O
, O
and O
the O
astonishing O
facility O
with O
which O
he O
could O
call O
up O
a O
bland O
smile O
and O
insinuating O
voice O
, O
to O
supersede O
the O
habitual O
haughtiness O
of O
his O
tone O
and O
manner O
. O
Educated O
at O
St. B-GPE
Omers E-GPE
, O
in O
all O
the O
dark O
superstitions O
of O
that O
bigoted O
college O
, O
the O
Abbe S-PERSON
was O
nevertheless O
far O
from O
desirous O
to O
seek O
within O
the O
walls O
of O
a O
cloister O
any O
protection O
from O
those O
temptations O
to O
worldly O
indulgence O
, O
which O
he O
had O
not O
even O
the O
wish O
to O
resist O
. O
He O
neither O
preached O
nor O
practised O
the O
virtues O
of O
his O
vocation O
, O
but O
paraded O
a O
whole O
troop O
of O
vices O
openly O
in O
the O
public O
eye O

and O
far O
from O
attempting O
to O
reform O
mankind O
, O
he O
never O
attempted O
even O
to O
reform O
himself O
. O
Though O
in O
personal O
appearance O
of O
distinguished O
ugliness O
, O
yet O
such O
was O
the O
magic O
of O
his O
manner O
, O
that O
even O
by O
ladies O
he O
was O
considered O
perfectly O
irresistible O

and O
to O
all O
, O
whether O
old O
or O
young O
, O
he O
generally O
succeeded O
in O
imparting O
a O
conviction O
, O
that O
he O
saw O
in O
her O
, O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
, O
a O
realization O
of O
female O
perfection O
and O
female O
fascination O
. O
The O
Abbe S-PERSON
was O
never O
known O
to O
stop O
half S-CARDINAL
- O
way O
in O
arduously O
pursuing O
any O
object O

or O
ambition O
, O
nor O
, O
whatever O
might O
be O
the O
impediments O

was O
he O
ever O
seen O
to O
fail O
of O
success O

for O
, O
like O
Bonaparte S-PERSON
, O

did O
not O
know O
the O
meaning O
of O
the O
word O
" O
impossible O

" O
After O
having O
recklessly O
squandered O
, O
in O
a O
career O
of O
almost O
startling O
dissipation O
, O
the O
whole O
of O
his O
own O
patrimony O
, O
it O
was O
believed O
that O
he O
had O
obtained O
fraudulent O
possession O
of O
£ O
10,000 S-MONEY
belonging O
to O
his O
very O
beautiful O
niece O
, O
to O
whom O
he O
must O
have O
refunded O
it O
had O
she O
lived O
to O
come O
of O
age O
, O
or O
had O
she O
married O
it O
must O
have O
been O
restored O
to O
her O
children O
, O
but O
about O
the O
time O
our O
story O
commences O
, O
she O
was O
supposed O
either O
to O
have O
died O
, O
or O
to O
have O
retired O
to O
a O
convent O
abroad O
, O
though O
whether O
upon O
conviction O
or O
not O
, O
might O
be O
considered O
very O
doubtful O
, O
as O
she O
had O
been O
educated O
by O
her O
mother O
in O
the O
Protestant S-NORP
faith O
, O
and O
it O
was O
generally O
conjectured O
that O
to O
so O
sudden O
and O
entire O
a O
removal O
from O
all O
former O
connections O
, O
her O
poverty O
more O
than O
her O
will O
must O
have O
consented O
. O
Laura B-PERSON
Mordaunt E-PERSON
had O
resided O
much O
at O
Kilmarnock B-PERSON
Abbe E-PERSON
with O
her O
uncle O
, O
to O
whom O
she O
seemed O
warmly O
and O
blindly O
attached O
, O
but O
the O
gossiping O
world O
sometimes O
conjectured O
that O
perhaps O
the O
evident O
partiality O
and O
admiration O
of O
Lord O
Doncaster S-PERSON
might O
have O
roused O
in O
her O
some O
ambitious O
thoughts O
, O
backed O
by O
the O
influence O
of O
the O
Abbe S-PERSON
. O
Among O
the O
peculiarities O
of O
the O
Marquis S-PERSON
he O
had O
always O
professed O
a O
decided O
contempt O
for O
all O
respectable O
ladies O
, O
and O
therefore O
his O
attentions O
to O
Laura B-PERSON
Mordaunt E-PERSON
were O
at O
best O
a O
very O
questionable O
compliment O
, O
and O
became O
naturally O
of O
a O
nature O
which O
few O
relatives O
would O
have O
wished O
to O
encourage O
, O
yet O
Miss O
Mordaunt S-PERSON
still O
remained O
a O

, O
— O
there O
was O
a O
sturdy O
, O
resolute O
, O
old O
- O
fashioned O
sense O
of O
honor O
in O
all O
his O

tempered O
by O
the O
kindest O

most O
considerate O
attention O
to O
the O
feelings O
, O
as O
well O

to O
the O
interest O
of O
all O
with O
whom O
he O
might O
be O
associated O
, O
and O
his O
sentiments O
were O
tinctured O
by O
a O
generous O
liberality O
, O
only O
limited O
in O
action O
by O
the O
rigid O
restraints O
consequent O
on O
a O
very O
narrow O
income O
, O
which O
he O
had O
never O
been O
known O
to O
exceed O
, O
though O
he O
was O
often O
heard O
jocularly O
to O
remark O
, O
that O
the O
surplus O
, O
after O
his O
yearly O
accounts O
were O
paid O
, O
would O
scarcely O
buy O
him O
a O
pair O
of O
gloves O
. O
Though O
the O
fire O
of O
Sir O
Arthur's S-PERSON
eyes O
had O
been O
quenched O
by O
approaching O
blindness O
, O
and O
his O
weather O

beaten O
countenance O
had O
been O
scarred O
in O
battle O

hardened O
by O
facing O
every O
tempest O
which O
had O
blown O
for O
half B-DATE
a I-DATE
century E-DATE
, O
yet O
his O
aspect O
had O
an O
air O
of O
habitual O
distinction O
and O
conscious O
dignity O
which O
commanded O
instant O
respect O
. O
There O
was O
an O
energy O
in O
the O
expression O
of O
his O
feelings O
, O
and O
a O
straightforward O
pursuit O
of O
what O
he O
thought O
right O
in O
all O
his O
actions O
, O
which O
gave O
him O
a O
singular O
influence O
over O
the O
affections O
and O
the O
conduct O
of O
those O
with O
whom O
he O
wished O
to O
associate O
, O
and O
the O
admirable O
use O
he O
made O
of O
which O
no O
one O
afterwards O
ever O
had O
cause O
to O
regret O
. O
His O
early O
life O
had O
been O
one O
full O
of O
action O
and O
of O
vigorous O
exertion O
, O
seeking O
, O
with O
old O
- O
fashioned O
patriotism O
, O
the O
honor O
of O
his O
country O
, O
more O
than O
the O
promotion O
of O
his O

in O
advanced O
years O
, O
when O
no O
longer O
able O
publicly O
to O
distinguish O
himself O
, O
he O
directed O
his O
time O
and O
talents O
to O
the O
diffusion O
of O
happiness O
at O
home O
, O
and O
to O
a O
zealous O
, O
diligent O
, O
and O
humble O
preparation O
for O
that O
long O
and O
quiet O
home O
to O
which O
he O
believed O
himself O
rapidly O
approaching O
, O
and O
which O
he O
contemplated O
with O
the O
best O
of O
all O
philosophy O
, O
— O
that O
of O
a O
truly O
devoted O
Christian S-NORP

With O
all O
the O
blunt O
frankness O
of O
his O
sailor O
- O
like O
manner O
, O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
could O
nevertheless O
testify O
an O
almost O
feminine O
gentleness O
and O
sympathy O
towards O
the O
unfortunate O
. O
He O
was O
often O
discovered O
to O
have O
exerted O
clandestinely O
a O
degree O
of O
activity O
and O
zeal O
in O
serving O
the O
needy O
and O
desolate O
, O
which O
to O
a O
mind O
less O
eager O
and O
generous O
, O
would O
have O
seemed O
almost O
incredible O
, O
— O
he O
never O
lacerated O
the O
feelings O
of O
those O
who O
came O
to O
him O
for O
comfort O
, O
by O
attempting O
to O
convince O
the O
sufferer O
, O
as O
most O
people O
begin O
by O
doing O
, O
on O
such O
occasions O

that O
the O
misfortune O
, O
whatever O
it O
be O
, O
is O
all O
his O
own O
fault O

he O
was O
quite O
as O
ready O
, O
as O
well O
as O
better O
pleased O
, O
to O
rejoice O
with O
those O
that O
rejoiced O

than O
to O
weep O
with O
those O
that O
wept O

without O
ever O

at O
any O
period O

and O
vociferous O
out O
- O
cries O
of O
" O
murder O
! O
" O
It O
was O
the O
sharp O
, O
shrill O
tone O
of O
a O
woman O
in O
the O
agony O
of O
fear O
, O
becoming O
more O
and O
more O
vehement O
at O
every O
repetition O
of O
the O
cry O
, O
while O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
dressed O
with O
the O
rapidity O
of O
a O
practised O
seaman O
, O
and O
hurried O
down O
stairs O
, O
where O
he O
found O
his O
maid O
- O
of O
- O
all O
- O
work O
, O
and O
his O
man O
- O
of O
- O
all O
- O
work O
, O
already O
assembled O
in O
breathless O
consternation O
round O
a O
trembling O
, O
terrified O
- O
looking O
servant O
girl O
, O
whose O
eyes O
were O
gleaming O
with O
an O
expression O
of O
frantic O
alarm O
, O
while O
, O
from O
her O
incoherent O
exclamations O
, O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
could O
only O
gather O
that O
some O
act O
of O
unutterable O
horror O
had O
been O
perpetrated O
in O
an O
opposite O
house O
, O
the O
windows O
of O
which O
were O
all O
partially O
closed O
, O
except O
one O
in O
the O
upper O
story O
, O
which O
was O
wide O
open O
, O
and O
seemed O
to O
be O
much O
broken O
and O
shattered O
. O
Without O
waiting O
another O
moment O
to O
investigate O
the O
business O
, O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
strode O
across O
the O
street O
, O
hurried O
in O
at O
the O
open O
door O
, O
and O
guided O
by O
a O
momentary O
cry O
of O
childish O
distress O
, O
he O
mounted O
the O
staircase O
, O
with O
an O
activity O
beyond O
his O
years O
, O
three S-CARDINAL
steps O
at O
a O
time O
, O
and O
precipitately O
entered O
the O
nearest O
room O
he O
could O
find O
. O
There O
he O
paused O
for O
a O
moment O
on O
finding O
himself O
in O
a O
splendidly O
- O
furnished O
bed- O
room O
, O
adorned O
with O
a O
degree O
of O
taste O
and O
elegance O
, O
far O
excelling O
what O
was O
customary O
in O
so O
obscure O
- O
looking O
a O
lodging O
, O
and O
the O
Admiral O
was O
about O
hastily O
to O
withdraw O
, O
when O
he O
became O
suddenly O
transfixed O
to O
the O
spot O
, O
and O
his O
eye O
seemed O
perfectly O
blasted O
by O
the O
spectacle O
which O
met O
his O
agitated O
and O
astonished O
gaze O
, O
while O
several O
moments O
elapsed O
before O
he O
had O
nerve O
to O
advance O
, O
and O
ascertain O
the O
reality O
of O
a O
scene O
, O
which O
filled O
him O
with O
horror O
. O
On O
a O
magnificent O
couch O
, O
the O
rich O
coverlet O
of O
which O
was O
drenched O
in O
blood O
, O
that O
had O
sprinkled O
the O
floor O
, O
and O
spouted O
to O
the O
very O
roof O
of O
the O
room O
, O
lay O
the O
cold O
stiffened O
corpse O
of O
a O
young O
female O
, O
whose O
head O
seemed O
to O
have O
been O
nearly O
severed O
from O
her O
body O
, O
while O
a O
violent O
contusion O
appeared O
upon O
her O
forehead O
. O
The O
wrist O
of O
her O
right O
hand O
, O
with O
which O
she O
had O
probably O
attempted O
to O
defend O
herself O
, O
had O
also O
been O
deeply O
cut O
, O
and O
in O
her O
hand O
she O
grasped O
a O
quantity O
of O
dark O
hair O
, O
which O
seemed O
to O
have O
been O
torn O
from O
the O
head O
of O
her O
assassin O
in O
the O
struggle O
for O
life O
. O
Her O
teeth O
were O
clenched O
, O
and O
her O
eye O
- O
balls O
were O
starting O
from O
their O
sockets O
with O
a O
look O
of O
agonised O
fear O
, O
most O
appalling O
to O
behold O
, O
and O
her O
long O
fair O
hair O
which O
lay O
in O
disordered O
billows O
on O
her O
shoulders O
, O
were O
matted O
with O
gore O
. O
A O
table O
near O
the O
bed O
had O
been O
overturned O
and O
broken O
, O
— O
a O
knife O
of O
very O
peculiar O
form O
, O
bent O
and O
distorted O
, O
lay O
conspicuously O
upon O
the O
pillow O
, O
as O
if O
placed O
there O
on O
purpose O
to O
attract O
notice O
, O
and O
the O
carpet O
, O
on O
which O
a O
pool O
of O
congealed O
blood O
had O
gathered O
, O
was O
likewise O
strewed O
with O
money O
, O
rings O
, O
bijouterie O
, O
trinkets O
, O
and O
plate O
. O
Nestled O
in O
a O
little O
crib O
, O
close O
beside O
the O
murdered O
woman O
, O
but O
plunged O
in O
a O
slumber O
so O
profound O
, O
that O
it O
could O
not O
be O
natural O
, O
slept O
undisturbed O
and O
uninjured O
, O
a O
lovely O
boy O
of O
about B-DATE
eight I-DATE
years I-DATE
old E-DATE
. O
His O
head O
rested O
on O
his O
arm O
, O
and O
a O
clustering O
profusion O
of O
jetty O
black O
hair O
fell O
over O
his O
blooming O
countenance O
, O
in O
which O
there O
was O
a O
look O
of O
almost O
death O
- O
like O
repose O
. O
Awakened O
with O
the O
utmost O
difficulty O
by O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
the O
child O
, O
who O
appeared O
to O
be O
of O
wondrous O
beauty O
, O
opened O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
a O
pair O
of O
bright O
blue O
, O
star O
- O
like O
eyes O
, O
and O
with O
a O
cry O
of O
terror O
, O
called O
for O
his O
mother O
, O
but O
a O
moment O
afterwards O
, O
overcome O
by O
irresistible O
drowsiness O
, O
his O
rosy O
cheek O
dropped O
upon O
the O
pillow O
, O
his O
heavy O
eyes O
were O
closed O
, O
and O
he O
relapsed O
into O
the O
same O
strange O
, O
mysterious O
insensibility O
as O
before O
. O
It O
was O
a O
fearful O
sight O
, O
that O
young O
mother O
, O
with O
her O
look O
of O
ghastly O
agony O
turned O
towards O
the O
ruddy O
healthful O
countenance O
of O
her O
child O
in O
his O
peaceful O
slumbers O
, O
and O
it O
was O
evident O
that O
her O
last O
thought O
had O
been O
for O
him O
, O
as O
his O
clothes O
were O
still O
convulsively O
held O
in O
her O
left O
hand O
, O
while O
a O
vain O
attempt O
had O
obviously O
been O
made O
to O
tear O
them O
asunder O
, O
— O
many O
deep O
cuts O
being O
visible O
on O
the O
child's O
night O
- O
gown O
, O
though O
his O
person O
had O
been O
left O
uninjured O
. O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
compassionately O
snatched O
the O
boy O
up O
in O
his O
arms O
, O
to O
hurry O
him O
away O
from O
the O
dreadful O
scene O
, O
and O
called O
the O
watchman O
, O
who O
instantly O
raised O
an O
alarm O
, O
and O
summoned O
the O
whole O
neighborhood O
to O
his O
assistance O
, O
when O
before O
ten B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
had O
elapsed O
, O
the O
room O
was O
filled O
with O
a O
crowd O
of O
agitated O
spectators O
, O
scared O
by O
the O
tremendous O
event O
, O
and O
crowding O
around O
the O
bed O
in O
every O
attitude O
of O
astonishment O
, O
terror O
, O
and O
commiseration O
, O
uttering O
exclamations O
of O
alarm O
, O
gazing O
helplessly O
at O
the O
frightful O
spectacle O
, O
and O
forming O
a B-CARDINAL
thousand E-CARDINAL
conjectures O
respecting O
the O
tragical O
event O
, O
instead O
of O
attempting O

give O
any O
rational O
assistance O
. O
" O
Not O

said O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
in O
the O
steady O
authoritive O
tone O
of O
one O
accustomed O
in O
great O
emergencies O
, O
to O
command O
, O
" O
Where O
are O
the O

" O
asked O
he O
, O
turning O
to O
the O
girl O
who O
had O
first S-ORDINAL
given O
an O
alarm O

" O

" O
" O
I O
have O
no O

Sir O

" O
replied O
she O
in O
a O
low O
incoherent O
whisper O
. O
" O
I O
think O
the O
lady O

What O

asked O
Sir O

earnestly O
. O
" O
A O
sort O
of O
clergyman O

I O

nothing O

Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON

in O
a O
deep O

solemn O
tone O

who O
started O
up O
in O
bed O
, O
with O
a O
look O
of O
bewildered O
perplexity O
, O
as O
he O
approached O
, O
asking O
in O
accents O
of O
tremulous O
alarm O
, O
what O
had O
occurred O
to O
cause O
this O
extraordinary O
disturbance O
. O
Her O
cheek O
was O
of O
an O
ashy O
paleness O
, O
her O
very O
lips O
were O
blanched O
, O
and O
her O
voice O
sounded O
husky O
and O
hollow O
with O
agitation O
| | O
but O
all O
this O
might O
be O
attributed O
to O
so O
sudden O
an O
inroad O
of O
strangers O
, O
while O
again O
and O
again O
she O
asked O
with O
quivering O
accents O
, O
whether O
any O
accident O
had O
occurred O
, O
and O
why O
they O
all O
appeared O
so O
alarmed O
. O
" O
At O
all O
events O
, O
my O
darling O
boy O
is O
safe O
! O
" O
added O
she O
, O
holding O
out O
her O
arms O
to O
the O
child O
, O
who O
instantly O
recoiled O
from O
her O
, O
with O
looks O
of O
unequivocal O
terror O
, O
and O
hiding O
his O
face O
on O
the O
shoulder O
of O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
he O
sobbed O
aloud O
with O
a O
degree O
of O
passionate O
grief O
and O
agitation O
which O
seemed O
almost O
beyond O
his O
years S-DATE
. O
The O
observant O
eye O
of O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
perceived O
that O
a O
dark O
scowl O
of O
malignity O
flitted O
for O
a O
moment O
across O
the O
beautiful O
features O
of O
Sarah S-PERSON
, O
whose O
brow O
became O
singularly O
contracted O
over O
her O
flashing O
eyes O
| | O
but O
making O
an O
effort O
instantly O
to O
recover O
herself O
, O
she O
averted O
her O
countenance O
, O
and O
added O
in O
a O
subdued O
voice O
of O
assumed O
tranquillity O
, O
" O
The O
child O
never O
knows O
me O
in O
a O
cap O
! O
I O
forgot O
to O
take O
it O
off O
, O
but O
the O
hurry O
of O
seeing O
so O
many O
strangers O
has O
confused O
me O
! O
" O
In O
an O
instant O
she O
snatched O
off O
her O
night O
- O
cap O
, O
when O
her O
shoulders O
and O
neck O
became O
covered O
with O
a O
cloud O
of O
dark O
massy O
ringlets O
, O
floating O
down O
below O
her O
waist O
, O
and O
shading O
her O
pallid O
countenance O
, O
which O
had O
assumed O
an O
expression O
of O
livid O
horror O
, O
and O
unnatural O
wildness O
. O
" O
Let O
him O
come O
to O
me O
now O
! O
" O
added O
she O
again O
, O
stretching O
out O
her O
arms O
with O
a O
ghastly O
smile O
| | O
but O
the O
boy O
struggled O
more O
vehemently O
than O
before O
, O
and O
clung O
to O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
with O
a O
tenacity O
and O
confidence O
, O
which O
deeply O
touched O
the O
old O
veteran's O
heart O
, O
who O
tried O
to O
soothe O
the O
terrified O
child O
by O
every O
endearment O
which O
his O
kind O
nature O
could O
suggest O
, O
while O
his O
attention O
was O
nevertheless O
enchained O
by O
observing O
the O
rigid O
, O
marble O
look O
of O
the O
young O
woman's O
countenance O
| | O
the O
dragged O
and O
corpse O
- O
like O
appearance O
which O
stole O
over O
her O
features O
, O
as O
if O
she O
had O
suffered O
a O
stroke O
of O
paralysis O
. O
" O
You O
have O
been O
frightened O
enough O
already O
, O
poor O
boy O
! O
" O
said O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
soothingly O
. O
" O
No O
one O
shall O
hurt O
you O
! O
With O
me O
at O
least O
you O
are O
safe O
! O
Stay O
where O
you O
are O
, O
and O
do O
not O
be O
alarmed O
! O
No O
one O
shall O
touch O
you O
but O
myself O
! O
" O
The O
child O
seemed O
to O
understand O
Sir O
Arthur's S-PERSON
promise O
of O
protection O
, O
and O
his O
head O
drooped O
sleepily O
down O
, O
while O
his O
eyes O
again O
closed O
in O
that O
deep O
unnatural O
slumber O
, O
from O
which O
he O
had O
been O
with O
so O
much O
difficulty O
aroused O
, O
till O
at O
length O
, O
" O
Now O
like O
a O
shutting O
flower O
, O
the O
senses O
close O
, O
And O
on O
him O
lies O
the O
beauty O
of O
repose O
. O
" O
" O
Young O
woman O
! O
" O
said O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
bending O
a O
look O
of O
penetrating O
scrutiny O
on O
Sarah B-PERSON
Davenport E-PERSON
, O
" O
how O
came O
you O
to O
be O
quietly O
asleep O
, O
and O
partly O
dressed O
too O
! O
while O
your O
mistress O
was O
murdered O
in O
the O
room O
immediately O
below O
! O
Did O
you O
hear O
no O
disturbance O
? O
Was O
no O
alarm O
given O
? O
" O
" O
My O
mistress O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
Sarah S-PERSON
, O
clasping O
her O
hands O
in O
an O
attitude O
of O
astonishment O
, O
and O
speaking O
as O
if O
every O
word O
would O
choke O
her O
, O
though O
not O
a O
muscle O
of O
her O
face O
was O
altered O
from O
the O
fixed O
and O
rigid O
look O
it O
had O
previously O
worn O
. O
" O
Oh O
! O
what O
will O
become O
of O
me O
! O
" O
" O
What O
will O
become O
of O
you O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
sternly O
, O
fixing O
his O
penetrating O
eye O
upon O
her O
. O
" O
Think O
rather O
of O
your O
murdered O
mistress O
! O
Come O
, O
come O
, O
girl O
! O
you O
performed O
that O
start O
very O
well O
| | O
but O
I O
know O
good O
acting O
! O
I O
greatly O
fear O
you O
are O
more O
concerned O
in O
this O
horrid O
business O
than O
we O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
suspected O
, O
and O
much O
more O
than O
you O
would O
wish O
to O
acknowledge O
. O
Get O
up O
instantly O
, O
and O
follow O
me O
! O
" O
There O
was O
something O
fearful O
and O
appalling O
in O
the O
silence O
which O
reigned O
among O
the O
many O
persons O
who O
had O
gathered O
around O
, O
when O
Sarah S-PERSON
, O
as O
a O
prisoner O
, O
was O
led O
into O
the O
chamber O
of O
death O
. O
A O
look O
of O
shuddering O
horror O
distorted O
for O
a O
moment O
her O
pale O
and O
haggard O
countenance O
, O
when O
she O
was O
unwillingly O
drawn O
forward O
to O
the O
place O
where O
her O
deceased O
mistress O
lay O
, O
and O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
with O
silent O
solemnity O
, O
pointed O
to O
the O
ghastly O
spectacle O
. O
His O
eyes O
were O
intensely O
and O
most O
mournfully O
fixed O
on O
the O
prisoner's O
sullen O
and O
nearly O
livid O
countenance O
, O
while O
she O
silently O
clung O
to O
a O
chair O
to O
support O
herself O
. O
Sarah S-PERSON
appeared O
neither O
startled O
nor O
astonished O
after O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
thrill O
of O
horror O
, O
but O
with O
a O
cold O
stony O
look O
of O
almost O
preternatural O
calmness O
, O
she O
muttered O
to O
herself O
in O
a O
low O
tone O
, O
which O
became O
nevertheless O
distinctly O
audible O
to O
all O
the O
spectators O
, O
and O
was O
evidently O
meant O
to O
be O
heard O
, O
— O
" O
Why O
am O
I O
brought O
here O
! O
I O
know O
nothing O
, O
about O
this O
! O
The O
poor O
lady O
has O
committed O
suicide O
! O
No O
wonder O
! O
She O
often O
wished O
herself O
dead O
! O
She O
had O
a O
miserable O
life O
of O
it O
, O
and O
has O
got O
rest O
at O
last O
! O
I O
wish O
! O
" O
added O
Sarah S-PERSON
suddenly O
, O
with O
vehement O
, O
almost O
frantic O
energy O
, O
" O
O O
how O
I O
wish O
that O
I O
could O
change O
places O
with O
her O
! O
O O
that O
I O
could O
be O
that O
cold O
, O
senseless O
image O
, O
without O
memory O
or O
feeling O
, O
without O
hope O
or O
fear O
, O
shut O
up O
from O
living O
wretchedness O
in O
everlasting O
sleep O

" O
" O
Let O
us O
hope O
that O
the O
Almighty O
has O
in O
mercy O
received O
her O
never O
- O
dying O
soul O
, O
and O
that O
in O
His O
own O
good O
time O
He O
will O
reveal O
the O
guilty O
assassins O
who O
sent O
her O
so O
suddenly O
to O
judgment O
, O
" O
said O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
solemnly O
. O
" O
Unburden O
your O
own O
mind O
now O
, O
by O
confessing O
all O
, O
and O
be O
assured O
it O
will O
relieve O
the O
agony O
you O
are O
so O
evidently O
suffering O
. O
Murder O
is O
like O
fire O
, O
it O
cannot O
be O
smothered O
long O
. O
" O
" O
I O
know O
nothing O

What O
could O
I O
know O

" O
replied O
Sarah S-PERSON
hurriedly O
. O
" O
She O
has O
destroyed O
herself O

or O
thieves O
have O
broken O
into O
the O
house O

robbed O
her O

Could O
I O
help O
that O
? O
" O
" O
No O
one O
has O
broken O
into O
this O
house O

" O
replied O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
scanning O
the O
expression O
of O
her O
fixed O
and O
apparently O
unalterable O
features O
. O
" O
But O
you O
can O
perhaps O
tell O
us O
who O
escaped O
by O
that O
shattered O
window O
above O
? O
Not O
a O
lock O
is O
broken O

not O
a O
door O

injured O

not O

missing O

among O
the O
many O
scattered O
around O
the O
room O

Here O
is O
money O
in O
abundance O

if O
gold O
had O
been O
the O
inducement O
! O
Some O
other O
motive O
has O
provoked O
this O
crime O
— O
jealousy O
perhaps O
— O
or O
revenge O
— O
— O
" O
At O
the O
last O
word O
an O
angry O
hectic O
rushed O
over O
the O
face O
, O
arms O
, O
and O
neck O
of O
the O
prisoner O
, O
and O
her O
eye O
glittered O
for O
a O
moment O
with O
an O
unnatural O
fire O
, O
which O
rapidly O
faded O
away O
, O
leaving O
her O
as O
pale O
and O
death O
- O
like O
as O
the O
corpse O
beside O
which O
she O
stood O
, O
and O
on O
which O
her O
eye O
now O
rested O
with O
a O
look O
of O
cold O

passionless O
indifference O

" O

was O
only O
yesterday O

Sarah S-PERSON

turning O
away O

" O

brought O
here O

added O
she O

with O
rising O
agitation O

and O
then O
suddenly O
bursting O
in O
a O
hideous O
maniacal O
laugh O
, O
which O
rang O
with O
fearful O
sound O
through O
the O
gloomy O
chamber O
, O
and O
caused O
the O
horror O
- O
struck O
spectators O
to O
fall O
hastily O
back O
, O
" O
I O
would O

it O

" O
Saying O
these O
words O
, O
with O
a O
scream O
of O
agony O
, O
she O
fell O
upon O
the O
floor O
in O
violent O
convulsions O
, O
from O
which O
it O
was O
nearly B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour E-TIME
before O
she O
entirely O
recovered O
, O
when O
faint O
, O
weak O
, O
and O
exhausted O
, O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
suggested O
that O
she O
could O
be O
carried O
to O
bed O

before O
she O
left O
the O
room O

anxious O
, O
if O
possible O
, O
to O
elucidate O
the O
mystery O
, O
and O
to O
gain O
some O
clue O
for O
pursuing O
the O
actual O
murderer O
, O
he O
detained O
Sarah S-PERSON
during O
a O
moment O
, O
and O
desired O
that O
a O
glass O
of O
water O
might O
be O
brought O
for O
her O
, O
hoping O
that O
the O
violent O
emotion O
she O
had O
betrayed O
might O
lead O
her O
to O
a O
full O
confession O

Laying O
his O
hand O
then O
upon O
her O
arm O

in O
tones O

deep O

awful O
solemnity O

he O
looked O
at O
her O

pointed O
once O

to O
the O
corpse O

night O

cries O

throw O
any O

the O
horrid O
deed O

tell O
all O

judgment O

soul O

by O
timely O
repentance O
you O
avert O
the O
fearful O
doom O

hereafter O
your O
heart O
will O
be O
tortured O
by O
the O
pangs O
of O
eternal O
despair O

Unfortunate O
woman O

consider O
now O
, O

during O
the O
long O
period O
of O
your O
approaching O
imprisonment O
, O
whether O
it O
be O
better O
to O
repent O

confess O
at O
once O

to O
confess O
and O
suffer O
everlastingly O
. O
" O
Not O
a O
word O

look O
gave O
evidence O
that O
Sarah S-PERSON
so O
much O
as O
heard O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
speak O
. O
Her O
large O
eyes O
were O
vacantly O
fixed O
on O
the O

, O
her O
hands O
were O
firmly O
clenched O

her O
teeth O
were O
set O
with O
an O
air O
of O
resolute O
determination O
, O
when O
, O
after O
a O
silence O
of O
several B-TIME
minutes E-TIME

during O
which O
her O
very O
stillness O
was O
frightful O

supported O
by O
some O
of O
the O
strangers O
around O

walked O
with O
almost O
mechanical O
unconsciousness O
out O
of O
the O
room O

Again O
and O
again O
the O
house O
was O
searched O
that O
day O

the O
very O
floors O
and O
wainscots O
torn O
up O

not O
a O
trace O

throw O
light O
upon O
the O
cause O

circumstances O

this O
disastrous O
event O

equally O
remarkable O
was O
it O

that O
no O

be O
obtained O
of O
who O

books O

not O
one O
retained O
any O

sketches O

executed O

found O
in O
a O
portfolio O

beside O

were O
written O
many O
simple O
verses O
, O
containing O
the O
most O
fervent O
expressions O
of O
tender O
affection O
and O
anxious O
solicitude O
for O
the O
boy O

the O
most O
passionate O
bursts O
of O
melancholy O

all O
conceived O
in O
general O
terms O

baffled O
the O
researches O

curiosity O

disguised O

surely O
I O

it O
before O

said O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
musingly O
examining O
the O
anonymous O
notes O

related O
chiefly O
to O
remittances O

money O

not O
met O

that O
month O

perfect O
grace O

beauty O

seems O
still O
almost O
to O
speak O

tongue O

in O
the O
language O

unpitied O

" O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
seated O
himself O
on O
a O
chair O
beside O
the O
couch O
for O
some O
moments O
in O
agitated O
reflection O
, O
vainly O
endeavoring O
to O
collect O
his O
thoughts O
, O
and O
form O
them O
into O
some O
tangible O
remembrance O

" O
It O
is O
a O
strange O
and O
bewildering O
sensation O
, O
to O
look O
at O
the O
mute O
features O
of O
this O
death O

like O
image O

to O
feel O
as O

once O

been O
known O
to O
me O
in O
her O
days O
of O
youth O

A O
vague O
harassing O
perplexity O
besets O
me O
in O
trying O
to O
realize O
the O
floating O

flickering O
remembrance O

which O
dimly O
mock O
my O
efforts O

catch O
them O

It O
seems O
like O
starting O
out O
on O
a O
dark O
night O

trying O
to O
distinguish O
some O
busy O
scene O

figures O

again O

met O
before O

Surely O
in O
some O
dream O
of O
former O
days O
I O
once O
beheld O
those O
fixed O

glassy O

up O

intelligence O

my O
treacherous O
memory O

not O
help O
me O

it O
recalls O
enough O

torture O
me O
with O
perplexity O

not O
enough O
to O
be O
of O
any O

" O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
wearied O
himself O
with O
intense O
efforts O
to O
identify O
the O
lineaments O
before O
him O
, O
but O
in O
vain O
. O
They O
were O
lovely O
indeed O
, O
and O
many O
a O
stranger O
came O
likewise O
to O
try O
whether O
they O
could O
be O
recognised O
, O

without O
success O

The O
fearful O
story O
circulated O
like O
wild O
- O
fire O
— O
the O
excitement O

curiosity O
it O
produced O
became O
intense O

not O
a O
gleam O

thrown O
upon O
the O
dark O

mysterious O
event O

Among O
the O
many O
who O
hurried O
to O
behold O
the O
murdered O
woman O
before O
her O
remains O
were O
disturbed O
, O
two S-CARDINAL
gentlemen O
arrived O
one B-TIME
evening E-TIME
after O
dusk O
, O
and O
having O
ascertained O
that O
neither O
the O
Admiral O
nor O
any O
other O
stranger O
was O
in O
the O
house O

they O
gave O
Sir O
Arthur's S-PERSON
servant O
, O
Martin S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
in O
attendance O
, O
a O
handsome O
donation O
, O
and O
desiring O
him O
not O
to O
follow O
, O
hurried O
up O
stairs O
, O
and O
remained O
in O
the O
room O
alone O
for O
several B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
. O
Both O
were O
much O
muffled O
up O
, O
and O
evidently O
avoided O
any O
scrutiny O
of O
their O
countenances O

but O
they O
seemed O
greatly O
agitated O
on O
leaving O
the O
room O

and O
as O
they O
hastened O
past O
Martin S-PERSON
, O
and O
threw O
themselves O
into O
a O
hackney O
coach O
which O
awaited O
them O
at O
some O
distance O
, O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
party O
had O
appeared O
so O
overcome O
, O
that O
he O
could O
not O
walk O
without O
support O
. O
Much O
conjecture O
was O
aroused O
by O
this O
incident O
, O
which O
seemed O
to O
increase O
the O
mystery O
and O
interest O
attached O
to O
the O
melancholy O
circumstances O
, O
and O
not O
a O
doubt O
could O
be O
entertained O
that O
these O
untimely O
visitors O
had O
a O
more O
than O
common O
connection O
with O
the O
affair O
, O
but O
of O
what O
nature O
, O
and O
to O
what O
degree O
, O
could O
only O
admit O
of O
very O
vague O
conjecture O
. O
Nothing O
could O
exceed O
the O
active O
interest O
taken O
in O
all O
the O
proceedings O
by O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
who O
seemed O
to O
forget O
all O
his O
years O
and O
infirmities O
, O
while O
keenly O
promoting O
the O
cause O
of O
truth O
and O
justice O
. O
Much O
as O
he O
had O
formerly O
bemoaned O
the O
trouble O
entailed O
upon O
him O
by O
deceased O
friends O
, O
many O
of O
whom O
had O
bequeathed O
their O
estates O
and O
children O
to O
his O
guardianship O
, O
he O
felt O
on O
this O
occasion O
, O
a O
pity O
so O
intense O
, O
for O
the O
nameless O
, O
friendless O
, O
and O
helpless O
boy O
, O
thus O
unexpectedly O
and O
tragically O
thrown O
on O
his O
compassion O
, O
that O
he O
publicly O
pledged O
himself O
to O
harbor O
and O
protect O
the O
child O
in O
the O
mean O
time O
, O
trusting O
that O
some O
connections O
might O
at O
last O
be O
found O
, O
to O
whom O
he O
more O
naturally O
belonged O
. O
" O
Life O
has O
had O
a O
mournful O
commencement O
for O
him O

poor O
boy O

His O
days O
are O
dark O

his O
friends O

said O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
strong O
emotion O
of O
pity O
, O
" O

we O
must O
hope O
for O
the O
best O
hereafter O

do O
the O
best O
that O
can O
be O
done O

cast O
him O
on O
my O
care O

also O
watch O
over O
his O
future O
welfare O

" O
On O
the B-TIME
night E-TIME
previous O

that O
appointed O
by O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
for O
committing O
to O
the O
grave O
the O
last O

the O
murdered O

often O

every O
form O

" O
kiss'd O
the O
mouth O
of O
a O
cannon O
in O
battle O
, O
" O
yet O
felt O
himself O
awed O

deeply O
affected O
in O
contemplating O
the O
solemn O
preparations O
for O
committing O
to O
the O
tomb O
one O
so O
young O
, O
so O
deeply O
injured O
, O
and O
so O
apparently O
unlamented O
. O
It O
was O
with O
mournful O
and O
mysterious O
wonder O
that O
he O
stood O
beside O
the O
corpse O
, O
and O
contemplated O
that O
mortal O
frame O
, O
from O
which O
the O
spirit O
had O
been O
so O
suddenly O
and O
so O
cruelly O
driven O

and O
he O
could O
not O
but O
imagine O
the O
scenes O
of O
love O
and O
joy O
which O
those O
eyes O
had O
once O
probably O
looked O
upon O
— O
the O
busy O
thoughts O
that O
had O
hurried O
through O
that O
lifeless O
head O

the O
warm O
affections O
that O
had O
flowed O
through O
that O
heart O
, O
now O
for O
ever O
at O
rest O

While O
yet O
his O
mind O
was O
dwelling O
with O
painful O
interest O
on O
all O
the O
thoughts O
which O
crowded O
through O
his O
fancy O

Martin S-PERSON
hastily O
entered O
the O
room O
, O

in O
an O
agitated O
voice O
requested O
Sir O
Arthur's S-PERSON
immediate O
presence O
in O
the O
entrance O
- O
hall O
, O
as O
some O
persons O
were O
there O

only O

himself O

On O
arriving O
in O
the O
passage O
, O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
was O
astonished O
, O

almost O
startled O
, O
to O
find O
several O
porters O
in O
the O
passage O

carrying O
a O
coffin O
magnificently O
decorated O

covered O
with O
a O
velvet O
pall O
, O
on O
the O
summit O
of O

was O
conspicuously O
placed O
a O
large O
brass O
plate O

with O
the O
date O

anxiously O

business O

CHAPTER O
V O
. O
The O
day O
of O
trial O
at O
length O
arrived O
, O
and O
the O
court O
, O
from O
the O
roof O
to O
the O
floor O
, O
seemed O
one S-CARDINAL
sea O
of O
faces O
, O
crowded O
together O
like O
the O
" O
studies O
of O
heads O
" O
on O
a O
painter's O
canvass O
. O
During O
the O
legal O
investigation O
, O
which O
was O
conducted O
with O
deep O
solemnity O
and O
anxious O
perseverance O
, O
the O
mystery O
became O
still O
deeper O
, O
and O
more O
inscrutable O
. O
No O
appearance O
of O
a O
robbery O
could O
be O
observed O
, O
except O
that O
the O
finger O
of O
the O
lady's O
hand O
, O
on O
which O
a O
wedding O
ring O
had O
probably O
been O
worn O
, O
was O
much O
bruised O
and O
discolored O
, O
as O
if O
, O
immediately O
after O
her O
decease O
, O
it O
had O
been O
violently O
torn O
off O
| | O
and O
a O
vain O
attempt O
had O
evidently O
been O
made O
to O
snatch O
away O
a O
gold O
chain O
hung O
round O
her O
neck O
, O
to O
which O
was O
appended O
a O
small O
broken O
miniature O
frame O
, O
set O
with O
brilliants O
, O
and O
adorned O
with O
what O
seemed O
to O
represent O
a O
very O
antique O
coronet O
. O
The O
portrait O
which O
it O
once O
enclosed O
, O
had O
been O
, O
with O
obvious O
difficulty O
removed O
, O
as O
the O
marks O
were O
visible O
all O
round O
, O
of O
some O
sharp O
- O
pointed O
instrument O
having O
been O
inserted O
in O
the O
frame O
, O
to O
which O
there O
still O
adhered O
several O
broken O
fragments O
of O
glass O
. O
Sarah B-PERSON
Davenport E-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
been O
fully O
committed O
for O
trial O
, O
on O
suspicion O
of O
being O
an O
accomplice O
, O
refused O
to O
give O
any O
references O
as O
to O
character O
, O
and O
was O
strongly O
suspected O
of O
habitually O
concealing O
her O
real O
name O
, O
and O
of O
more O
than O
once O
assuming O
those O
that O
were O
fictitious O
, O
as O
her O
clothes O
and O
linen O
appeared O
to O
be O
marked O
with O
various O
initials O
, O
but O
in O
not O
one S-CARDINAL
case O
did O
they O
bear O
those O
that O
she O
pretended O
were O
her O
own O
. O
It O
was O
evident O
that O
she O
labored O
under O
a O
powerful O
, O
but O
forcibly O
- O
subdued O
excitement O
| | O
yet O
, O
with O
a O
tone O
and O
manner O
externally O
cold O
and O
hard O
as O
Siberian S-NORP
ice O
, O
she O
persisted O
in O
professing O
her O
own O
perfect O
innocence O
, O
and O
her O
utter O
consciousness O
of O
anything O
that O
might O
by O
possibility O
lead O
to O
a O
discovery O
of O
the O
perpetrators O
. O
She O
coldly O
, O
and O
almost O
calmly O
, O
threw O
back O
glance O
for O
glance O
, O
on O
the O
spectators O
nearest O
her O
, O
who O
were O
keenly O
watching O
every O
turn O
of O
her O
countenance O
, O
while O
dark O
surmises O
, O
and O
fearful O
conjectures O
, O
were O
whispered O
in O
murmurs O
of O
horror O
on O
every O
side O
| | O
but O
at O
length O
her O
eye O
wandered O
to O
a O
distant O
part O
of O
the O
court O
, O
when O
suddenly O
a O
livid O
paleness O
flashed O
upon O
her O
face O
— O
an O
indescribable O
but O
startling O
lustre O
glittered O
in O
her O
eyes O
— O
her O
whole O
frame O
shook O
, O
as O
in O
the O
coldest O
blast O
of O
winter O
, O
and O
with O
a O
suppressed O
groan O
of O
agony O
and O
fear O
, O
she O
bowed O
her O
head O
upon O
her O
hands O
, O
and O
sunk O
fainting O
upon O
the O
floor O
. O
At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
a O
man O
was O
observed O
hastily O
to O
leave O
the O
court O
, O
and O
, O
gliding O
with O
rapid O
steps O
through O
the O
narrow O
passages O
, O
disappeared O
, O
before O
any O
of O
those O
who O
stood O
near O
had O
presence O
of O
mind O
to O
stop O
him O
, O
or O
could O
even O
identify O
his O
appearance O
. O
Nothing O
apparently O
touched O
the O
feelings O
of O
Sarah B-PERSON
Davenport E-PERSON
, O
except O
when O
a O
suspicion O
seemed O
to O
be O
implied O
that O
she O
meant O
to O
injure O
the O
boy O
| | O
and O
when O
a O
question O
to O
this O
effect O
was O
put O
to O
her O
by O
the O
court O
, O
she O
wrung O
her O
hands O
and O
burst O
into O
tears O
, O
saying O
, O
in O
accents O
of O
piercing O
anguish O
, O
though O
with O
a O
shudder O
as O
if O
death O
were O
upon O
her O
, O
" O
No O
! O
oh O
, O
no O
! O
Who O
suspects O
that O
I O
would O
injure O
a O
hair O
of O
his O
head O
! O
He O
once O
loved O
me O
! O
Few O
— O
few O
but O
he O
, O
ever O
did O
! O
— O
none O
that O
have O
not O
afterwards O
given O
me O
reason O
to O
hate O
them O
! O
I O
am O
a O
solitary O
, O
lost O
, O
and O
desolate O
being O
| | O
but O
let O
him O
not O
forget O
in O
after O
years S-DATE
, O
that O
I O
saved O
his O
life O
! O
— O
that O
I O
saved O
it O
at O
a O
risk O
you O
never O
can O
conceive O
! O
" O
An O
impulse O
of O
mournful O
interest O
and O
astonishment O
ran O
through O
the O
assembled O
multitude O
, O
when O
they O
beheld O
the O
rare O
and O
singular O
beauty O
of O
the O
child O
, O
after O
he O
was O
led O
into O
court O
| | O
and O
it O
seemed O
as O
if O
the O
spectators O
had O
ceased O
to O
breathe O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
began O
to O
answer O
some O
of O
the O
questions O
which O
were O
skilfully O
put O
, O
to O
draw O
out O
his O
recollections O
of O
past O
times O
, O
and O
especially O
the O
dark O
history O
of O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
few I-DATE
weeks E-DATE
. O
He O
was O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
shy O
and O
intimidated O
, O
but O
gradually O
regained O
an O
unexpected O
degree O
of O
self O
- O
possession O
, O
and O
spoke O
with O
a O
surprising O
degree O
of O
intelligence O
and O
distinctness O
of O
all O
he O
remembered O
. O
The O
boy O
retained O
a O
faint O
recollection O
of O
having O
been O
awakened O
, O
on O
the O
night O
of O
the O
murder O
, O
by O
some O
violent O
scene O
of O
strife O
and O
horror O
| | O
but O
his O
faculties O
had O
evidently O
been O
so O
benumbed O
by O
opiates O
, O
that O
no O
distinct O
impression O
remained O
| | O
and O
to O
his O
own O
young O
mind O
, O
the O
whole O
seemed O
like O
a O
fearful O
dream O
, O
too O
dreadful O
to O
look O
back O
upon O
even O
yet O
, O
except O
with O
bewildering O
terror O
. O
He O
gave O
a O
clear O
account O
, O
however O
, O
of O
the O
last O
evening O
he O
had O
passed O
with O
his O
mother O
, O
of O
whom O
he O
spoke O
in O
accents O
of O
infantine O
affection O
, O
evidently O
unable O
yet O
to O
conceive O
that O
he O
should O
see O
her O
face O
no O
more O
. O
An O
old O
gentleman O
, O
he O
said O
, O
had O
come O
into O
the O
room O
and O
spoken O
angrily O
to O
her O
| | O
while O
, O
with O
astonishing O
precision O
, O
the O
boy O
acted O
over O
the O
whole O
scene O
, O
recapitulated O
some O
of O
the O
language O
they O
had O
used O
, O
and O
described O
how O
his O
mother O
had O
hung O
to O
him O
with O
frantic O
eagerness O
, O
saying O
she O
would O
promise O
anything O
, O
if O
she O
might O
only O
retain O
her O
child O

how O
the O
stranger O
, O
who O
was O
very O
tall O
, O
and O
wore O
a O
black O
coat O
, O
had O
spoken O
again O
with O
angry O
vehemence O
before O
he O
left O
the O
room O
| | O
and O
how O
his O
mother O
, O
when O
left O
alone O
, O
had O
prayed O
and O
wept O
over O
him O
with O
looks O
of O
agonized O
and O
desolate O
grief O
, O
until O
he O
had O
been O
carried O
away O
to O
bed O
by O
the O
maid O
, O
who O
administered O
some O
medicine O
to O
him O
, O
which O
she O
said O
the O
doctor O
had O
ordered O
. O
He O
spoke O
much O
also O
of O
a O
large O
room O
, O
hung O
with O
pictures O
, O
in O
which O
his O
earliest O
days O
had O
been O
passed O
, O
and O
of O
a O
small O
dark O
apartment O
close O
beside O
it O
, O
into O
which O
he O
had O
often O
been O
precipitately O
hurried O
, O
apparently O
for O
concealment O
, O
and O
where O
toys O
and O
sweetmeats O
had O
been O
always O
provided O
to O
keep O
him O
quiet O
, O
while O
he O
was O
punished O
with O
the O
utmost O
severity O
, O
for O
making O
the O
slightest O
noise O

still O
remembered O
with O
looks O
of O
apprehension O

Sarah B-PERSON
Davenport E-PERSON
was O
then O
recalled O

rigidly O
cross-examined O
, O
respecting O
the O
gentleman O
who O
had O
visited O
at O
the O
house O

but O
she O
doggedly O
asserted O
her O
entire O
ignorance O
respecting O
his O
rank O
in O
life O
, O
or O
connections O
, O
and O
pertinaciously O
maintained O
that O
the O
lady's O
death O
had O
been O
her O
own O
voluntary O
act O
, O
and O
that O
the O
sleeping O
potion O
had O
been O
given O
to O
the O
boy O
by O
his O
mother's O
own O
imperative O
orders O
, O
as O
she O
did O
not O
herself O
know O
even O
what O
it O
contained O
. O
During O
a O
long O
and O
anxious O
consultation O
of O
the O
jury O
, O
there O
was O
a O
hushed O
and O
intense O
silence O
in O
the O
court O
, O
so O
still O
and O
unbroken O
, O
that O
the O
breathing O
of O
an O
infant O
would O
have O
been O
audible O
, O
while O
every O
eye O
perused O
the O
countenance O
of O
the O
prisoner O
, O
with O
an O
intensity O
that O
brought O
a O
hectic O
flush O
, O
burning O
like O
fire O
, O
upon O
her O
cheek O
, O
and O
she O
gazed O
around O
with O
a O
glance O
of O
anger O
that O
caused O
her O
beauty O
for O
the O
moment O
to O
look O
like O
that O
of O
a O
fiend O
or O
a O
fury O
. O
At O
length O
, O
after O
arduously O
scrutinizing O
every O
atom O
of O
evidence O
that O
could O
be O
gathered O
, O
the O
jury O
, O
though O
morally O
certain O
of O
the O
prisoner's O
being O
an O
accomplice O
in O
the O
crime O
, O
felt O
unwillingly O
obliged O
to O
bring O
in O
a O
verdict O
of O
" O
not O
proven O
, O
" O
and O
she O
was O
immediately O
liberated O
, O
after O
which O
, O
amidst O
the O
yells O
, O
jeers O
, O
and O
execrations O
of O
the O
populace O
who O
were O
convinced O
of O
her O
criminality O
, O
she O
hurried O
from O
the O
court O
, O
and O
was O
seen O
no O
more O
. O
Nothing O
is O
half O
so O
attractive O
as O
a O
mystery O
, O
and O
many O
crowded O
at O
first S-ORDINAL

with O
a O
temporary O
enthusiasm O
, O
to O
see O
the O
beautiful O
boy O
, O
so O
strangely O
bereaved O

so O
cruelly O
abandoned O

but O
the O
interest O

excitement O
of O
hearing O

relating O
his O

soon O
superseded O

speedily O
hurried O

were O
tired O
at O

Every O

hinted O
that O

ten S-CARDINAL

Sir O

" O
When O
Henry B-PERSON
De I-PERSON
Lancey E-PERSON
lost O
one S-CARDINAL
parent O
, O
he O
certainly O
gained O
another O
in O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
who O
often O
afterwards O
remarked O
, O
that O
in O
no O

more O

shown O
to O
this O
fascinating O
boy O

gay O

joyous O
spirits O
became O
a O
source O
of O
perpetual O
amusement O

him O

while O
the O

seemed O
to O
derive O
new O

from O
watching O
the O
frolicsome O
gambols O

his O
young O

enlivened O
by O
the O
gleeful O
vivacity O

his O
niece O
Marion S-PERSON

when O
she O
escaped O
a B-DATE

On O
many O

the O
sensibility O
of O
Henry B-PERSON
De I-PERSON
Lancey E-PERSON
seemed O
already O
to O
have O
attained O
almost O
the O
depth O

intensity O
of O
manhood O
, O
so O
strong O
were O
the O
bursts O
of O
natural O
feeling O

occasionally O
spoke O

it O
was O
deeply O

trace O
throughout O

thus O
early O
made O
in O
his O
education O

the O
careful O

Sir O

was O
delighted O
from O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
to O
remark O
, O
yet O
, O
when O
the O
merry O
group O
of O
young O
friends O
assembled O
together O
on O
the O
shore O
of O
Portobello S-GPE

building O
houses O

running O
eagerly O

it O
would O
have O
been O
difficult O
to O
say O
which O
was O
the O
most O
carelessly O
happy O
, O
while O
the O
Admiral O
seemed O
to O
borrow O
their O
young O
spirits O
for O
the O
time O
, O
and O
gazed O
with O
ceaseless O
delight O
on O
those O
joyous O
countenances O

radiant O
with O
laughter O

smiles O

which O
were O
archly O
turned O
towards O
their O
aged O
playmate O

sometimes O
with O
a O
challenge O

run O
after O
them O

lighted O
up O
with O
smiles O

torn O
roughly O
from O

a O
stronger O
hold O
upon O

it O
appeared O

anxious O

forget O

ever O
existed O

the O

interesting O
boy O

unknown O

a O
circumstance O
occurred O
, O
not O
long O
after O
Henry's S-PERSON
adoption O
, O
which O
brought O
painfully O
to O
mind O

with O
greatly O
increased O
solicitude O
, O
the O
fearful O
mystery O
that O
hung O
over O

Sir O

sometimes O
watching O
their O
gambols O
with O
pleasure O
, O
and O
frequently O
conning O
over O
a O
newspaper O
, O
which O
proved O
by O
undeniable O
and O
satisfactory O
demonstration O
, O
that O
the O
country O
was O
entirely O
ruined O
— O
that O
the O
Government O
was O
coming O
to O
an O

— O
that O
the B-ORG
Houses I-ORG

be O
completely O
demolished O

not O
another O

about O

drop O
their O
extinguisher O
over O
Great B-GPE
Britain E-GPE

Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
had O
read O
the O

thing O
in O
different O
words O
every O
day O
during O
fifty B-DATE
years E-DATE
, O
and O
under O
twenty S-CARDINAL
varied O
administrations O

yet O
still O
the O
wonder O
grew O
, O
how O
a O
constitution O
so O
mismanaged O
could O
so O
long O
survive O
, O
and O
that O
when O
all O
was O
wrong O
at O
the O
head O
of O
the O
country O
, O
it O
still O
had O
a O
leg O
to O
stand O
on O
. O
The O
Admiral's S-NORP
patriotic O
meditations O
had O
been O
several O
times O
interrupted O
by O
repeated O
complaints O
from O
the O
little O
girls O
, O
that O
Henry S-PERSON
had O
hid O
himself O
so O
well O
, O
that O
they O
could O
not O
possibly O
find O
him O

but O
he O
was O
too O
much O
pre-occupied O
to O
give O
the O
subject O
much O
attention O
, O
till O
at O
length O
Martin S-PERSON
announced O
that O
the O
children's O
dinner O
had O
waited O
some O
time O
, O
and O
that O
still O
the O
boy O
was O
not O
to O
be O
found O
, O
though O
his O
companions O
had O
been O
searching O
for O
him O
at B-TIME
least I-TIME
half I-TIME
an I-TIME
hour E-TIME
. O
Upon O
hearing O
this O
, O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
hastily O
started O
up O
, O
making O
a O
considerable O
expenditure O
of O
energetic O
and O
wondrous O
explanations O
, O
while O
he O
gazed O
around O
with O
increasing O
surprise O
at O
the O
wide O
waste O
of O
sand O
, O
like O
an O
Arabian S-NORP
desert O
, O
with O
which O
he O
was O
on O
every O
side O
encompassed O
, O
and O
where O
it O
seemed O
to O
him O
as O
if O
a O
mouse O
could O
not O
be O
long O
concealed O

A O
hasty O
and O
most O
anxious O
search O
was O
instantly O
commenced O
in O
the O
garden O
, O
while O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
and O
Martin S-PERSON
shouted O
the O
name O
of O
Henry S-PERSON
at O
the O
full O
pitch O
of O
their O
voices O

was O
heard O
in O
reply O
, O
nor O
was O
there O
a O
spot O
unexamined O
in O
which O
he O
could O
by O
possibility O
be O
lurking O
. O
The O
Admiral O
now O
became O
seriously O
alarmed O
at O
so O
unaccountable O
a O
disappearance O
, O
especially O
when O
the O
child's O
gardening O
tools O
, O
with O
which O
he O
had O
been O
last O
observed O
, O
were O
found O
mutilated O
and O
broken O
, O
at O
a O
great O
distance O
, O
on O
the O
beach O
— O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
his O
shoes O
had O
fallen O
off O
close O
to O
the O
water O
, O
and O
his O
hat O
lay O
nearly O
buried O
in O
the O
tide O
. O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
instantly O
summoned O
the O
police O
to O
his O
aid O
, O
but O
the O
search O
continued O
fruitless O
, O
till O
at O
length O
the O
dreadful O
conjecture O
became O
more O
and O
more O
probable O
, O
that O
Henry S-PERSON
must O
have O
rashly O
ventured O
into O
the O
water O
, O
and O
been O
washed O
away O
by O
the O
waves O
— O
in O
pursuance O
of O
which O
apprehension O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
summoned O
more O
assistance O
, O
that O
the O
water O
might O
instantly O
be O
dragged O
. O
Martin S-PERSON
, O
meantime O
, O
no O
less O
active O
than O
his O
master O
, O
had O
accidentally O
met O
a O
stranger O
on O
the O
beach O
, O
who O
mentioned O
, O
on O
hearing O
of O
his O
alarm O
, O
that O
on O
the O
road O
to O
Leith S-GPE
, O
half B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour E-TIME
before O
, O
he O
had O
observed O
a O
boy O
struggling O
and O
screaming O
in O
the O
arms O
of O
a O
female O
, O
dressed O
like O
a O
nursery O
- O
maid O
, O
who O
complained O
loudly O
that O
the O
child O
would O
not O
go O
home O
, O
when O
a O
young O
man O
, O
rather O
strangely O
dressed O
, O
and O
of O
very O
singular O
appearance O
, O
had O
instantly O
offered O
his O
assistance O
, O
and O
carried O
him O
forcibly O
onwards O
. O
This O
gentleman O
said O
he O
had O
stopped O
the O
woman O
to O
remonstrate O
with O
her O
on O
using O
the O
boy O
so O
roughly O
, O
as O
a O
cap O
was O
drawn O
over O
his O
eyes O
, O
and O
he O
seemed O
to O
suffer O
agonies O
of O
terror O
, O
sobbing O
convulsively O
, O
and O
trembling O
in O
every O
limb O
| | O
but O
the O
man O
had O
answered O
in O
reply O
, O
with O
a O
strong O
Irish S-NORP
accent O
, O
that O
he O
would O
see O
the O
child O
safe O
to O
his O
friends O
, O
and O
let O
no O
one O
do O
the O
poor O
boy O
" O
a O
taste O
of O
harm O
. O
" O
The O
stranger O
added O
indifferently O
, O
that O
it O
was O
no O
affair O
of O
his O
, O
therefore O
he O
ceased O
to O
interfere O
| | O
but O
he O
thought O
both O
the O
man O
and O
the O
woman O
had O
a O
very O
bad O
expression O
, O
and O
he O
would O
not O
trust O
either O
of O
them O
with O
his O
dog O
for O
an B-TIME
hour E-TIME
, O
to O
use O
it O
kindly O
. O
Without O
wasting O
time O
in O
returning O
to O
communicate O
what O
he O
had O
heard O
, O
Martin S-PERSON
hurried O
forward O
to O
Leith S-PERSON
, O
where O
, O
with O
reckless O
speed O
and O
untiring O
diligence O
, O
he O
threaded O
all O
the O
narrow O
streets O
, O
and O
elbowed O
his O
way O
among O
carts O
, O
carriages O
, O
parcels O
, O
and O
passengers O
, O
till O
at O
length O
he O
reached O
the O
pier O
, O
to O
which O
he O
had O
been O
so O
eagerly O
aiming O
his O
steps O
. O
At O
its O
farthest O
point O
stood O
a O
smoking O
steam O
- O
boat O
in O
full O
boil O
, O
while O
men O
and O
women O
, O
boxes O
, O
packages O
, O
bags O
, O
and O
trunks O
were O
pouring O
in O
| | O
and O
at O
length O
, O
as O
he O
breathlessly O
approached O
within O
some B-QUANTITY
hundred I-QUANTITY
yards E-QUANTITY
, O
an O
arbitrary O
little O
bell O
was O
rung O
, O
to O
summon O
stragglers O
on O
board O
, O
and O
to O
hurry O
stragglers O
away O
. O
A O
single O
plank O
, O
connecting O
the O
steam O
- O
boat O
with O
the O
pier O
, O
was O
on O
the O
point O
of O
being O
withdrawn O
, O
when O
Martin S-PERSON
approached O
| | O
and O
while O
he O
paused O
, O
in O
momentary O
hesitation O
whether O
to O
pursue O
his O
almost O
hopeless O
search O
, O
the O
steward O
peremptorily O
desired O
him O
to O
hasten O
on O
board O
instantly O
, O
if O
he O
were O
coming O
at O
all O
, O
as O
not O
a O
moment O
more O
could O
be O
lost O
. O
At O
this O
moment O
a O
cry O
, O
almost O
amounting O
to O
a O
scream O
of O
childish O
joy O
, O
became O
audible O
on O
the O
deck O
— O
a O
young O
boy O
was O
seen O
vehemently O
struggling O
in O
the O
arms O
of O
a O
female O
| | O
and O
in O
an O
instant O
, O
pursued O
by O
a O
man O
who O
vainly O
endeavored O
to O
overtake O
him O
, O
he O
rushed O
past O
the O
steward O
, O
ran O
across O
the O
temporary O
bridge O
, O
and O
clasped O
Martin S-PERSON
round O
the O
knees O
, O
exclaiming O
, O
with O
eager O
incoherent O
exclamations O
of O
almost O
hysterical O
delight O
, O
" O
Take O
me O
, O
Martin S-PERSON
! O
take O
me O
! O
O O
let O
me O
go O
home O
to O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
! O
I O
did O
not O
come O
away O
without O
leave O
! O
I O
did O
not O
, O
indeed O
! O
That O
naughty O
, O
horrid O
woman O
forced O
me O
! O
She O
tied O
a O
cap O
over O
my O
face O
, O
and O
would O
not O
let O
me O
go O
back O
! O
I O
have O
been O
so O
frightened O
and O
so O
sorry O
, O
" O
added O
the O
child O
, O
bursting O
into O
tears O
, O
and O
sobbing O
as O
if O
his O
heart O
would O
break O
| | O
" O
I O
thought O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
would O
be O
angry O
, O
and O
I O
thought O
, O
perhaps O
, O
I O
would O
never O
see O
him O
again O
! O
O O
take O
me O
home O
, O
Martin S-PERSON
! O
take O
me O
home O
! O
and O
let O
me O
never O
see O
these O
people O
again O
! O
" O
The O
boy O
put O
his O
hand O
, O
with O
an O
air O
of O
happy O
confidence O
and O
security O
into O
that O
of O
Martin S-PERSON
, O
who O
snatched O
him O
up O
in O
his O
arms O
, O
with O
a O
thousand S-CARDINAL
expressions O
of O
joyful O
surprise O
| | O
but O
a O
moment O
afterwards O
, O
when O
he O
recollected O
himself O
, O
his O
first S-ORDINAL
impulse O
was O
to O
secure O
the O
culprits O
who O
had O
decoyed O
Henry S-PERSON
away O
, O
and O
to O
deliver O
them O
up O
to O
a O
magistrate O
for O
examination O
. O
With O
this O
intention O
, O
he O
looked O
hastily O
around O
, O
intending O
to O
cause O
their O
immediate O
apprehension O
| | O
but O
the O
steam O
- O
boat O
had O
sailed O
off O
| | O
and O
all O
the O
gesticulations O
he O
could O
make O
to O
bring O
them O
back O
only O
caused O
the O
steward O
laughingly O
to O
shake O
his O
head O
, O
thinking O
that O
Martin S-PERSON
had O
merely O
missed O
his O
passage O
, O
as O
he O
deserved O
, O
for O
not O
showing O
more O
alacrity O
in O
obeying O
his O
injunctions O
to O
embark O
. O
At O
Portobello S-GPE
, O
meantime O
, O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
had O
suffered O
agonies O
of O
grief O
, O
and O
even O
of O
self O
- O
reproach O
, O
thinking O
he O
had O
too O
securely O
relied O
on O
the O
safety O
of O
his O
young O
protege O
| | O
and O
with O
a O
heavy O
heart O
he O
was O
still O
directing O
his O
steps O
, O
and O
conducting O
his O
assistants O
to O
the O
most O
probable O
places O
for O
finding O
the O
child's O
body O
, O
having O
already O
ordered O
his O
maid O
to O
have O
everything O
in O
readiness O
, O
in O
case O
a O
chance O
remained O
of O
his O
being O
restored O
to O
life O
, O
when O
he O
felt O
a O
gentle O
pull O
at O
the O
skirt O
of O
his O
coat O
, O
and O
, O
on O
looking O
down O
, O
he O
uttered O
a O
volley O
of O
joyful O
exclamations O
, O
on O
beholding O
the O
radiant O
countenance O
of O
Henry S-PERSON
, O
whom O
he O
clasped O
in O
his O
arms O
with O
unutterable O
joy O
. O
While O
Martin S-PERSON
and O
the O
boy O
himself O
gave O
each O
his O
own O
history O
of O
the O
strange O
adventure O
, O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
walked O
up O
and O
down O
in O
a O
state O
of O
irrepressible O
irritation O
, O
clenching O
his O
teeth O
, O
and O
grasping O
his O
walking O
- O
stick O
firmly O
in O
his O
hand O
, O
as O
if O
about O
to O
wreak O
instant O
vengeance O
on O
the O
miscreants O
. O
At O
length O
, O
after O
exhausting O
his O
indignation O
, O
he O
took O
Henry S-PERSON
again O
in O
his O
arms O
, O
declaring O
he O
would O
never O
for O
a O
moment O
lose O
sight O
of O
him O
again O
. O
Nothing O
in O
Henry's S-PERSON
narrative O
threw O
the O
slightest O
gleam O
of O
light O
on O
the O
plans O
or O
intentions O
of O
the O
strange O
man O
and O
woman O
, O
which O
seemed O
destined O
to O
remain O
buried O
in O
impenetrable O
obscurity O
. O
They O
had O
evidently O
been O
accomplices O
in O
decoying O
him O
from O
home O
| | O
and O
the O
boy O
had O
brought O
away O
from O
the O
steam O
- O
boat O
a O
small O
book O
which O
they O
had O
given O
him O
, O
full O
of O
ribald O
songs O
and O
profane O
jests O
, O
but O
covered O
with O
magnificent O
boards O
, O
and O
clasped O
with O
silver O
hinges O
, O
which O
seemed O
to O
have O
once O
belonged O
to O
some O
ancient O
missal O
, O
and O
still O
retained O
in O
the O
inside O
a O
collection O
of O
texts O
beautifully O
written O
in O
a O
very O
remarkable O
hand O
, O
which O
seemed O
to O
be O
that O
of O
a O
highly O
- O
educated O
female O
. O
For O
some O
time O
afterwards O
, O
several O
suspicious O
- O
looking O
people O
were O
seen O
lurking O
about O
Sir O
Arthur's S-PERSON
premises O
, O
late B-TIME
at I-TIME
night E-TIME
| | O
and O
one B-TIME
evening E-TIME
a O
shot O
was O
fired O
suddenly O
in O
at O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
window O
, O
which O
passed O
so O
near O
to O
Henry's S-PERSON
head O
, O
that O
his O
hair O
was O
actually O
disturbed O
| | O
but O
though O
an O
active O
police O
had O
been O
placed O
on O
the O
watch O
, O
not O
a O
trace O
could O
be O
obtained O
of O
the O
authors O
of O
this O
outrage O
. O
As O
time O
wore O
on O
, O
and O
the O
mind O
of O
Henry S-PERSON
rapidly O
expanded O
on O
all O
subjects O
of O
classical O
learning O
and O
general O
science O
, O
the O
fearful O
and O
melancholy O
events O
of O
his O
early O
years O
faded O
considerably O
from O
his O
mind O
, O
while O
he O
made O
astonishing O
progress O
at O
the O
excellent O
school O
where O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
placed O
him O
, O
exhibiting O
that O
happy O
, O
but O
rare O
combination O
of O
deep O
thought O
, O
and O
refinement O
of O
mind O
, O
with O
extreme O
liveliness O
of O
fancy O
, O
and O
enthusiasm O
of O
character O
. O
This O
threw O
a O
perfect O
witchery O
over O
his O
conversation O
, O
which O
sparkled O
with O
vivacity O
, O
or O
flowed O
with O
uncommon O
depth O
and O
power O
, O
as O
best O
suited O
the O
occasion O
, O
while O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
during O
his O
intercourse O
with O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
he O
became O
imbued O
with O
the O
highest O
principles O
of O
honor O
and O
good O
- O
feeling O
| | O
and O
from O
his O
master O
he O
imbibed O
the O
most O
enlightened O
knowledge O
of O
the O
doctrines O
and O
duties O
of O
Christianity S-NORP
, O
with O
the O
profoundest O
reverence O
for O
its O
precepts O
and O
practice O
. O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
felt O
a O
dreary O
blank O
during O
Henry's S-PERSON
absence O
at O
school O
, O
which O
became O
more O
and O
more O
intolerable O
as O
his O
eyesight O
was O
at O
length O
nearly O
extinct O
| | O
and O
he O
had O
serious O
thoughts O
of O
engaging O
a O
person O
to O
walk O
out O
with O
him O
during O
the O
day O
, O
and O
to O
read O
to O
him O
during O
the O
evening O
, O
being O
of O
opinion O
that O
it O
is O
the O
highest O
wisdom O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
best O
Christianity S-NORP
, O
cheerfully O
to O
meet O
every O
appointed O
privation O
, O
and O
derive O
from O
the O
blessings O

Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
often O
remarked O
to O
his O
friend O
, O
Lady B-PERSON
Towercliffe E-PERSON
, O
that O
it O
is O
a O
misfortune O
to O
wear O
out O
a O
taste O
of O
any O
inoffensive O
occupation O

and O
he O
began O
to O
fear O
it O
might O
be O
possible O
for O
him O
to O
survive O
his O
enjoyment O

off O

I O
seemed O

No O

Sir O

mentioned O
incidentally O
, O
to O
Lady B-PERSON

several O

out O

it O
made O
Sir O

almost O
melancholy O
in O
examining O
testimonials O

ought O
to O
have O
procured O
any O

No O

the O

for O

Lady O

had O
not O
some O

no O

did O
she O
hear O
that O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
required O
a O
secretary O

reader O

she O
wrote O
him O
a O
note O
of O
seven S-CARDINAL
pages O

closely O
penned O

in O
which O
she O
made O
it O
evident O
that O
there O
was O
but O
one S-CARDINAL
individual O
in O
the O
world O
who O
could O
suit O
, O

ought O
to O
suit O

that O
one S-CARDINAL

was O
the O
bearer O
of O
her O
despatch O

waited O

with O
all O
her O
zeal O
in O

Lady B-PERSON
Towercliffe E-PERSON
knew O
very O
little O
of O
the O
young O
man O
she O
so O
vehemently O
recommended O

but O
having O
accidentally O
met O
him O
in O
a O
bookseller's O
shop O
, O
he O
had O
been O
employed O
by O
her O
to O
copy O
some O
verses O
in O
an O
album O
, O
and O
she O
thought O
him O
, O
without O
exception O

one O
of O
the O
most O
civil O
and O
grateful O
creatures O

the O
world O
, O
who O
really O
deserved O
encouragement O
. O
When O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
sent O
for O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
up O
stairs O
, O
his O
kind O
heart O
was O
almost O
shocked O
at O
the O
tone O
of O
wild O
energy O
, O
and O
the O
look O
of O
feverish O
anxiety O
with O
which O
he O
entreated O
that O
his O
capabilities O
might O
be O
tried O
. O
His O
figure O
, O
though O
youthful O
, O
was O
tall O
, O
gaunt O
, O
and O
meagre O
, O
while O
his O
care O
- O
worn O
countenance O
, O
which O
bore O
a O
stern O
and O
melancholy O
aspect O
, O
was O
lighted O
up O
by O
large O
, O
dark O
, O
flashing O
eyes O
, O
in O
which O
there O
gleamed O
an O
expression O
of O
singular O
excitement O
. O
He O
appeared O
young O
and O
handsome O
, O
but O
not O
prepossessing O
— O
so O
gloomy O
and O
determined O
was O
the O
expression O
of O
his O
firmly O
- O
compressed O
mouth O
, O
that O
it O
seemed O
almost O
indicative O
of O
ferocity O
| | O
and O
his O
eye O
had O
that O
peculiarity O
invariably O
expressing O
evil O
— O
an O
impossibility O
of O
looking O
any O
one O
steadily O
in O
the O
face O
. O
" O

great O
disadvantage O

friendless O

and O
poverty O

struck O

said O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
look O
of O
eager O
, O
deprecating O
solicitude O
, O
which O
spoke O
at O
once O
to O
the O
generous O
heart O
of O
the O
Admiral O
, O
and O
filled O
him O
with O
commiseration O
. O
" O
Fate O
and O
fortune O
have O
hitherto O
frustrated O
my O
efforts O

weighed O
me O
down O
with O
life O
- O
crushing O
sorrows O

only O
give O
me O
employment O

I O
would O
not O
thank O
the O
Queen O
to O
be O
my O
cousin O
! O
" O
It O
was O
a O
favorite O
saying O
with O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
that O
he O
would O
be O
more O
ashamed O
to O
suspect O
mankind O
, O
than O
to O
be O
deceived O
by O
them O
| | O
and O
if O
he O
had O
a O
weakness O
in O
the O
world O
it O
was O
a O
total O
incapacity O
to O
give O
pain O
. O
Touched O
by O
the O
nervous O
excitement O
in O
Mr. O
Howard's S-PERSON
eye O
and O
manner O
, O
which O
he O
attributed O
entirely O
to O
his O
necessitous O
circumstances O
, O
he O
almost O
immediately O
engaged O
him O
, O
to O
the O
entire O
satisfaction O
of O
Lady B-PERSON
Towercliffe E-PERSON
, O
who O
never O
asked O
or O
cared O
any O
more O
about O
her O
protege O
, O
gratified O
that O
he O
had O
achieved O
" O
a O
job O
, O
" O
and O
that O
by O
her O
interest O
, O
and O
hers O
only O
, O
a O
place O
in O
the O
world O
had O
been O
filled O
up O
, O
which O
would O
have O
been O
occupied O
by O
some O
one O
else O
, O
perhaps O
equally O
deserving O
, O
if O
she O
had O
not O
interfered O
, O
and O
she O
was O
satisfied O
for O
the O
present O
to O
have O
been O
of O
consequence O
to O
somebody O
, O
no O
matter O
whom O
. O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
generally O
spoke O
in O
a O
subdued O
, O
mysterious O
voice O
, O
as O
if O
afraid O
to O
let O
himself O
know O
what O
he O
was O
saying O
| | O
yet O
sometimes O
his O
words O
came O
forth O
with O
a O
rushing O
impetuosity O
, O
full O
of O
energy O
and O
fire O
, O
like O
lightning O
itself O
. O
His O
hollow O
, O
blood O
- O
shot O
eyes O
, O
betrayed O
a O
wild O
, O
watchful O
, O
suspicious O
expression O
, O
by O
no O
means O
prepossessing O
| | O
and O
there O
was O
something O
inscrutable O
in O
the O
bland O
, O
perpetual O
smile O
he O
always O
wore O
upon O
his O
countenance O
, O
and O
in O
the O
frozen O
tranquillity O
of O
his O
manner O
, O
which O
occasionally O
, O
though O
seldom O
, O
gave O
way O
to O
bursts O
of O
tempestuous O
emotion O
. O
The O
very O
pupils O
of O
his O
eyes O
seemed O
to O
have O
become O
darker O
, O
with O
a O
fearfully O
wild O
and O
ferocious O
expression O
when O
irritated O
, O
while O
the O
fierce O
fire O
flashed O
out O
from O
beneath O
his O
lowering O
brows O
, O
with O
a O
blaze O
of O
inexpressible O
fury O
| | O
yet O
in O
a O
moment O
he O
could O
command O
himself O
again O
into O
a O
cold O
, O
calm O
, O
and O
almost O
haughty O
exterior O
, O
while O
the O
spectral O
paleness O
of O
his O
handsome O
countenance O
made O
him O
look O
like O
marble O
itself O
. O
Years S-DATE
passed O
on O
, O
during O
which O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
endured O
, O
rather O
than O
enjoyed O
, O
Mr. O
Howard's S-PERSON
attendance O
, O
whose O
pre-occupied O
air O
and O
vague O
manner O
continually O
annoyed O
him O
| | O
but O
his O
benevolent O
heart O
shrunk O
from O
consigning O
the O
poor O
man O
to O
that O
hopeless O
and O
solitary O
want O
which O
he O
seemed O
to O
apprehend O
must O
inevitably O
follow O
the O
loss O
of O
his O
present O
situation O
, O
and O
from O
day O
to O
day O
he O
postponed O
the O
decision O
, O
till O
habit O
grew O
into O
second S-ORDINAL
nature O
, O
and O
he O
became O
so O
accustomed O
to O
hear O
" O
The B-ORG
Times E-ORG
, O
" O
column O
after O
column O
, O
spouted O
forth O
in O
a O
rather O
theatrical O
tone O
by O
his O
reader O
, O
and O
to O
dictate O
notes O
and O
letters O
to O
his O
very O
silent O
and O
diligent O
secretary O
, O
that O
he O
almost O
forgot O
at O
last O
to O
think O
of O
parting O
with O
him O
. O
When O
Henry S-PERSON
returned O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
from O
school O
, O
six B-DATE
or I-DATE
seven I-DATE
months E-DATE
after O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
had O
become O
domesticated O
at O
Portobello S-FAC
, O
the O
secretary O
professed O
a O
vehement O
fancy O
for O
the O
boy O
, O
would O
fetch O
and O
carry O
for O
him O
like O
a O
tame O
dog O
, O
and O
loaded O
him O
with O
attentions O
| | O
yet O
, O
though O
in O
general O
most O
affectionately O
grateful O
to O
all O
who O
showed O
him O
even O
a O
trifling O
kindness O
, O
these O
assiduities O
and O
flatteries O
were O
lavished O
upon O
him O
in O
vain O
. O
The O
boy O
shrunk O
instinctively O
from O
Mr. O
Howard's S-PERSON
notice O
, O
but O
could O
assign O
no O
other O
reason O
to O
himself O
or O
others O
for O
this O
apparently O
unreasonable O
antipathy O
, O
except O
merely O
that O
the O
stranger O
resembled O
somebody O
he O
had O
seen O
before O
, O
but O
how O
, O
when O
, O
or O
where O
, O
not O
a O
trace O
remained O
in O
his O
memory O
. O
This O
little O
caprice O
did O
not O
appear O
to O
be O
noticed O
or O
resented O
by O
the O
secretary O
, O
till O
one B-DATE
day E-DATE
, O
when O
Henry S-PERSON
refused O
some O
bon-bons O
which O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
offered O
him O
, O
saying O
, O
the O
last O
he O
accepted O
had O
made O
him O
sick O
, O
and O
when O
the O
boy O
soon O
after O
flew O
gaily O
out O
of O
the O
room O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
was O
for O
a O
moment O
startled O
and O
surprised O
to O
observe O
the O
malignant O
scowl O
with O
which O
the O
eye O
of O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
followed O
Henry S-PERSON
. O
It O
was O
a O
glance O
, O
fell O
and O
malignant O
, O
that O
feared O
to O
be O
seen O
, O
while O
his O
cheek O
became O
pale O
as O
death O
, O
but O
whether O
in O
anger O
or O
in O
sorrow O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
thought O
it O
impossible O
to O
divine O
. O
As O
Henry S-PERSON
grew O
older O
, O
his O
instinctive O
dread O
of O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
seemed O
only O
to O
increase O
, O
but O
he O
was O
too O
considerate O
to O
disturb O
the O
tranquillity O
of O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
by O
mentioning O
it O
, O
or O
to O
injure O
the O
poor O
man O
himself O
, O
by O
giving O
way O
to O
a O
feeling O
of O
dislike O
so O
unaccountable O
, O

yet O
so O
perfectly O
unconquerable O

after O
many B-DATE
years E-DATE
of O
such O
prudent O
self O
- O
restraint O
, O
when O
nearly O
grown O
up O

manhood O
he O
could O
not O
help O
saying O
one O
day O
, O
in O
a O
careless O
tone O
, O
to O
the O
Admiral O
, O
after O
witnessing O
a O
sudden O
outbreak O
of O
temper O
in O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
that O
morning O
, O
" O
Your O
secretary O
always O
reminds O
me O
, O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
of O
Sinbad's S-GPE
Old O
Man O
of O
the O
Sea O
. O
It O
seems O
impossible O
to O
get O
handsomely O
rid O
of O
him O
, O
and O
he O
will O
never O
certainly O
make O
a O
voluntary O
departure O
! O
" O
" O
I O
fear O
not O
! O
" O
replied O
the O
Admiral O
, O
with O
something O
between O
a O
smile O
and O
a O
sigh O
. O
" O
He O
does O
all O
I O
desire O
him O
, O
but O
without O
interest O
or O
pleasure O
, O
and O
he O
has O
the O
most O
undisguised O
contempt O
for O
every O
living O
being O
, O
almost O
amounting O
to O
hatred O
, O
yet O
he O
expresses O
unbounded O
gratitude O
for O
being O
harbored O
in O
my O
house O
. O
What O
can O
I O
do O
? O
It O
would O
be O
cruel O
to O
kick O
the O
man O
out O
of O
doors O
, O
merely O
because O
he O
is O
unhappy O
| | O
but O
I O
have O
often O
observed O
, O
Henry S-PERSON
, O
that O
he O
is O
no O
favorite O
of O
yours O
, O
though O
that O
is O
the O
only O
subject O
on O
which O
you O
have O
never O
been O
entirely O
open O
with O
me O
. O
" O
" O
Because O
I O
am O
heartily O
ashamed O
of O
my O
feelings O
, O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
and O
you O
are O
the O
last O
person O
on O
earth O
to O
whom O
I O
wish O
to O
tell O
anything O
against O
myself O
. O
You O
have O
told O
me O
there O
are O
people O
with O
a O
loathing O
antipathy O
to O
cats O
, O
and O
somewhat O
similar O
is O
the O
shuddering O
sensation O
with O
which O
I O
see O
your O
worthy O
secretary O
enter O
the O
room O
. O
A O
sort O
of O
shiver O
comes O
over O
me O
, O
and O
a O
wish O
to O
keep O
him O
off O
— O
to O
avoid O
his O
very O
glance O
and O
touch O
. O
He O
has O
a O
strange O
under- O
look O
certainly O
! O
His O
smile O
makes O
me O
shudder O
! O
and O
yet O
the O
feeling O
is O
quite O
undefinable O
! O
They O
say O
dogs O
and O
children O
have O
an O
instinctive O
liking O
or O
antipathy O
to O
those O
who O
secretly O
like O
or O
hate O
them O
, O
and O
perhaps O
my O
sensation O
is O
on O
somewhat O
similar O
grounds O
. O
" O
There O
is O
something O
fearful O
in O
the O
eye O
of O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
, O
occasionally O
, O
when O
I O
catch O
it O
fixed O
upon O
myself O
, O
" O
added O
Henry S-PERSON
rapidly O
, O
but O
in O
a O
sort O
of O
musing O
, O
absent O
under-tone O
, O
while O
his O
voice O
acquired O
a O
deeper O
tinge O
of O
thought O
, O
" O
I O
seem O
to O
have O
beheld O
him O
once O
in O
a O
dream O
! O
When O
he O
looks O
at O
me O
in O
that O
strange O
and O
extraordinary O
manner O
, O
his O
eyes O
like O
the O
flickering O
glare O
of O
light O
in O
a O
gloomy O
cavern O
, O
I O
feel O
and O
know O
that O
at O
some O
period O
in O
my O
life O
I O
have O
seen O
such O
a O
countenance O
before O
! O
The O
time O
and O
place O
have O
escaped O
me O
, O
but O
the O
remembrance O
is O
painful O
, O
and O
in O
his O
presence O
I O
cannot O
but O
be O
convinced O
that O
I O
am O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
an O
enemy O
. O
It O
is O
a O
feeling O
I O
can O
neither O
drive O
away O
, O
nor O
distinctly O
realize O
! O
" O
" O
Why O
did O
you O
never O
tell O
me O
this O
before O
, O
Henry S-PERSON
? O
" O
asked O
the O
Admiral O
, O
rising O
with O
agitation O
. O
" O
He O
has O
been O
hardly O
dealt O
with O
by O
fortune O
, O
but O
surely O
you O
do O
not O
think O
— O
— O
" O
" O
Think O
! O
! O
— O

I O
think O
nothing O
, O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
for O
I O
know O
nothing O
, O
and O
I O
ought O
not O
to O
have O
spoken O
as O
I O
have O
done O
, O
— O
it O
was O
wrong O
and O
rash O
. O
I O
shall O
try O
to O
conquer O
this O
, O
— O
to O
conquer O
myself O
, O
— O
and O
, O
as O
they O
say O
, O
acquired O
tastes O
are O
always O
the O
strongest O
, O
I O
may O
yet O
learn O
to O
like O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
better O
than O
any O
one O
living O
| | O
but O
, O
in O
the O
mean O
time O
, O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
he O
does O
occasionally O
look O
to O
me O
, O
very O
like O
some O
stray O
member O
of O
the B-ORG
Lunatic I-ORG
Asylum E-ORG
! O
" O
" O
I O
sometimes O
think O
, O
" O
said O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
" O
that O
Howard S-PERSON
has O
a O
bee O
in O
his O
bonnet O

He O
has O

whole O
hive O

" O
replied O
Henry S-PERSON
in O
his O
usual O
off O
- O
hand O
tone O

but O
when O
he O
looked O
round O
, O
as O
is O
usual O
, O
when O
people O
are O
spoken O
of O
, O
the O
individual O
himself O
, O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
, O
stood O
before O
him O
. O
A O
mortal O
paleness O
had O
overspread O
his O
countenance O
, O
contending O
emotions O
seemed O
flitting O
across O
his O
lowering O
brow O
, O
like O
shifting O
clouds O
in O
a O
threatening O
sky O
, O
and O
his O
eye O
gleamed O
upon O
young O
De B-PERSON
Lancey E-PERSON
with O
a O
look O
of O
maniacal O
fury O
| | O
but O
the O
same O
artificial O
smile O
was O
on O
his O
lips O
which O
he O
habitually O
assumed O
, O
while O
, O
in O
the O
blandest O
tone O
of O
courtesy O
, O
he O
turned O
from O
the O
steady O
penetrating O
gaze O
of O
Henry S-PERSON
to O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
saying O
, O
in O
a O
tone O
of O
servile O
cunning O
, O
but O
with O
a O
smile O
the O
most O
ghastly O
that O
was O
ever O
seen O
on O
a O
human O
face O
, O
" O
Every O
fool O
can O
find O
fault O
, O
but O
my O
livelihood O
fortunately O
depends O
not O
on O
any O
boyish O
caprice O
. O
It O
is O
derived O
from O
the O
generosity O
of O
a O
noble O
mind O
, O
unbiassed O
by O
cruel O
and O
unfounded O
prejudices O

may O

said O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
certain O
tone O
of O
interrogation O
in O
his O
voice O
, O
for O
he O
abhorred O
the O
slightest O
approach O
to O
flattery O
, O
and O
always O
had O
an O
instinctive O
apprehension O
that O
it O
was O
accompanied O
by O
deceit O

" O
We O
are O
too O
ready O
often O

throw O
the O
blame O

when O
our O
own O

nature O

to O
blame O

For O
my O

part O
, O
I O
have O
met O
with O
little O
unkindness O

ingratitude O
hitherto O

would O
willingly O
look O
upon O
the O
sunny O
side O
of O
life O

hoping O
all O
things O

" O
The O
darkened O
sight O
of O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
prevented O
him O
from O
perceiving O
that O
in O
the O
countenance O
of O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
there O
flitted O
a O
quick O
succession O
of O
emotions O

fiery O

vivid O
as O
summer O

Henry S-PERSON
observed O
with O
astonishment O
the O
powerful O
though O
ineffectual O
efforts O
he O
made O
to O
control O
his O
agitation O

His O
hands O
were O
clenched O
, O
till O
the O
very O
blood O
seemed O
ready O
to O
spring O

he O
gnawed O
his O
nether O
lip O
with O
frightful O
vehemence O
, O

his O
eyes O
shot O
fire O
from O
beneath O
his O
dark O
and O
frowning O
brow O

With O
a O
glance O
of O
unspeakable O
malevolence O
at O
Henry S-PERSON
, O
and O
a O
hurried O
bow O
to O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON

hastened O
with O
rapid O
steps O
out O

out O

formed O
mentally O
as O
well O
as O
personally O
in O
the O
very O
poetry O
of O
nature O
, O
the O
perfect O
grace O
and O
symmetry O
of O
her O
features O
became O
enlivened O
frequently O
by O
a O
rich O
and O
radiant O
smile O
, O
like O
a O
Hebe O
, O
glowing O
with O
the O
richest O
hues O
of O
health O
and O
joy O
. O
Her O
splendid O
eyes O
sparkled O
with O
every O
passing O
emotion O
, O
sometimes O
dimmed O
for O
a O
moment O
by O
tears O
of O
sensibility O
, O
but O
usually O
glittering O
with O
smiles O
, O
while O
occasionally O
, O
when O
amused O
or O
delighted O
, O
she O
burst O
into O
a O
comic O
, O
elfish O
laugh O
, O
the O
very O
essence O
of O
glee O
and O
joyousness O
— O
a O
most O
enlivening O
accompaniment O
to O
what O
she O
said O
, O
while O
her O
conversation O
, O
always O
fresh O
and O
unpremeditated O
, O
rushed O
straight O
from O
her O
heart O
, O
fresh O
and O
natural O
as O
a O
mountain O
stream O
. O
The O
color O
of O
a O
violet O
was O
not O
more O
deeply O
blue O
than O
the O
dark O
, O
unfathomable O
eyes O
of O
Marion S-GPE
, O
shaded O
by O
a O
fringe O
of O
eye O
- O
lashes O
that O
might O
have O
been O
mistaken O
for O
black O
. O
No O
description O
could O
do O
justice O
to O
the O
fascination O
of O
her O
smile O
, O
without O
one S-CARDINAL
shade O
of O
affectation O
, O
while O
her O
pure O
transparent O
complexion O
, O
fresh O
as O
a O
bouquet O
of O
roses O
, O
took O
a O
richer O
tint O
from O
all O
the O
fleeting O
emotions O
which O
chased O
each O
other O
through O
her O
mind O
. O
A O
rich O
profusion O
of O
nut O
- O
brown O
hair O
played O
around O
her O
high O
arched O
forehead O
of O
alabaster O
whiteness O
, O
and O
a O
thousand S-CARDINAL
laughing O
dimples O
quivered O
around O
her O
delicately O
- O
formed O
mouth O
, O
giving O
her O
a O
merry O
, O
joyous O
look O
of O
girlish O
beauty O
, O
varied O
occasionally O
by O
a O
melting O
softness O
of O
expression O
when O
she O
looked O
on O
any O
countenance O
that O
she O
loved O
. O
On O
one S-CARDINAL
occasion O
, O
a O
celebrated O
sculptor O
asked O
Sir O
Patrick's S-PERSON
permission O
to O
take O
a O
cast O
of O
Marion's S-PERSON
head O
, O
and O
on O
obtaining O
the O
desired O
permission O
, O
he O
observed O
, O
that O
if O
those O
features O
could O
be O
turned O
into O
marble O
, O
he O
would O
stake O
his O
whole O
fame O
on O
the O
impossibility O
of O
any O
critic O
pointing O
out O
a O
single O
defect O
. O
But O
while O
admiration O
is O
given O
by O
the O
eye O
of O
an O
artist O
merely O
to O
symmetry O
, O
expression O
is O
the O
mystery O
of O
beauty O
| | O
and O
the O
charm O
of O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
in O
the O
estimation O
of O
her O
friends O
, O
was O
, O
that O
her O
face O
seemed O
like O
a O
mirror O
formed O
to O
reflect O
every O
emotion O
of O
their O
own O
hearts O
. O
The O
most O
stern O
and O
morose O
of O
human O
beings O
must O
have O
been O
conciliated O
into O
some O
degree O
of O
regard O
by O
the O
deep O
tenderness O
of O
a O
character O
" O
without O
one O
jarring O
atom O
form'd O
, O
" O
which O
seemed O
made O
only O
to O
love O
and O
to O
be O
loved O
. O
While O
her O
gay O
fancy O
revelled O
in O
" O
cheerful O
yesterdays O
and O
confident O
to O
- O
morrows O
, O
" O
the O
flowers O
that O
grew O
around O
her O
path O
, O
the O
birds O
that O
sang O
as O
she O
passed O
, O
the O
very O
turf O
beneath O
her O
feet O
, O
and O
the O
sky O
above O
her O
head O
, O
called O
forth O
her O
feelings O
. O
She O
had O
a O
tear O
to O
spare O
for O
the O
sorrows O
of O
every O
one O
who O
claimed O
her O
sympathy O
, O
and O
a O
ready O
smile O
for O
the O
joys O
of O
all O
her O
companions O
, O
while O
yet O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
unoccupied O
love O
remained O
at O
her O
disposal O
, O
the O
chief O
portion O
of O
which O
was O
bestowed O
with O
prodigal O
enthusiasm O
on O
her O
indulgent O
uncle O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
whose O
doting O
affection O
would O
have O
spoiled O
any O
other O
disposition O
, O
but O
only O
rendered O
her O
more O
keenly O
to O
merit O
and O
to O
deserve O
his O
partiality O
. O
In O
the O
estimation O
of O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
his O
" O
little O
Marion S-PERSON
" O
never O
became O
a O
day O
older O
, O
and O
he O
considered O
her O
a O
perfect O
prodigy O
in O
everything O
she O
said O
or O
did O
, O
watching O
all O
her O
words O
, O
and O
entering O
into O
all O
her O
juvenile O
feelings O
with O
a O
versatility O
of O
mind O
astonishing O
at O
his O
advanced O
age O
. O
Nothing O
on O
earth O
is O
more O
touching O
than O
to O
see O
the O
warmth O
of O
sensibility O
and O
enthusiasm O
yet O
surviving O
the O
chill O
of O
many O
a O
year O
in O
this O
disappointing O
and O
sorrowing O
world O
| | O
but O
there O
was O
a O
degree O
of O
mutual O
confidence O
between O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
and O
his O
young O
niece O
which O
can O
seldom O
exist O
with O
a O
disparity O
of O
years S-DATE
and O
circumstances O
. O
Besides O
all O
her O
feminine O
gentleness O
, O
and O
almost O
poetical O
gracefulness O
of O
character O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
yet O
displayed O
at O
times O
a O
power O
of O
intellect O
and O
an O
energetic O
strength O
of O
character O
for O
which O
a O
superficial O
observer O
would O
have O
been O
totally O
unprepared O
| | O
for O
her O
mind O
seemed O
always O
to O
rise O
in O
proportion O
to O
the O
occasion O
, O
while O
she O
had O
been O
born O
apparently O
to O
practise O
without O
reserve O
that O
beautiful O
Christian S-NORP
rule O
, O
for O
each O
individual O
always O
to O
consider O
himself O
last O
. O
Rarely O
are O
deep O
feelings O
and O
intense O
sensibility O
united O
with O
that O
high O
intelligence O
of O
mind O
, O
and O
that O
vivid O
gladness O
of O
spirit O
peculiar O
to O
Marion S-PERSON
| | O
but O
the O
stream O
of O
her O
mind O
was O
deep O
as O
well O
as O
sparkling O
, O
while O
during O
her O
early O
years O
sorrow O
flitted O
through O
her O
cheerful O
, O
laughter O
- O
loving O
mind O

like O
the O
shadow O
of O
a O
butterfly O

flower O

" O
she O
knew O
not O
why O

car'd O
not O

, O
" O
there O
was O
a O
peculiar O
grace O
in O
all O
she O
did O
, O
and O
an O
infectious O
merriment O
in O
all O
she O
said O
, O
which O
attracted O
a O
joyous O
group O
of O
companions O
continually O
around O
her O
, O
on O
whom O
the O
light O
of O
her O
own O
buoyant O
vivacity O
seemed O
to O
be O
continually O
and O
brightly O
reflected O
. O
Nothing O
could O
be O
more O
pleasing O
and O
characteristic O
than O
to O
observe O
the O
refined O
ingenuity O
with O
which O
, O
from O
the O
earliest O
age O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
tried O
to O
evade O
receiving O
the O
multitude O
of O
little O
presents O
with O
which O
it O
was O
Sir O
Arthur's S-PERSON
delight O
to O
surprise O
her O
. O
Trinkets O
and O
toys O
would O
have O
multiplied O
around O
her O
, O
if O
she O
had O
not O
frequently O
made O
an O
ostentation O
of O
possessing O
more O
than O
it O
was O
possible O
for O
her O
to O
use O
| | O
and O
when O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
allowed O
her O
a O
choice O
in O
any O
gift O
he O
was O
about O
to O
force O
on O
her O
acceptance O
, O
she O
invariably O
selected O
that O
which O
seemed O
least O
expensive O
| | O
and O
her O
uncle O
afterwards O
told O
, O
that O
when O
, O
on O
the O
twelfth S-ORDINAL
anniversary O
of O
her O
birthday O
, O
he O
clasped O
a O
beautiful O
Maltese S-NORP
chain O
round O
her O
neck O
, O
she O
said O
to O
him O
, O
with O
a O
deepening O
color O
and O
faltering O
voice O
, O
" O
I O
would O
like O
better O
to O
love O
you O
for O
nothing O
, O
uncle O
Arthur S-PERSON
! O
My O
drawers O
up O
stairs O
are O
like O
a O
jeweler's O
shop O
already O

You O
know O
I O
inherited O
half S-CARDINAL
dear O
mamma's O
ornaments O

and O
Patrick S-PERSON
says O
you O
bring O
Rundell B-FAC

Bridge E-FAC
in O
your O
pocket O
every O
time O
I O
have O
a O
holiday O

I O
would O
be O
quite O
as O
happy O
to O
see O
you O
all O
for O
yourself O

" O
The O
merry O
- O
eyed O
Marion S-PERSON
seemed O
to O
" O
wear O
her O
heart O
upon O
her O
sleeve O
, O
" O

to O
see O
only O
what O
was O
best O
in O
all O
those O
with O
whom O
she O
associated O
. O
With O
her O
small O
means O
, O
it O
was O
truly O
astonishing O
how O
frequently O
and O
ingeniously O
she O
invented O
some O
unobtrusive O
way O
of O
conferring O
a O
favor O
on O
her O
companions O
, O
as O
if O
she O
were O
receiving O
rather O
than O
bestowing O
one O

and O
it O
certainly O
appeared O
as O
if O
she O
scarcely O
knew O
the O
difference O
. O
There O
was O
not O
an O
individual O
among O
her O
numerous O
young O
contemporaries O
who O
did O
not O
often O
relate O
traits O
of O
goodness O
in O
one O
whom O
they O
always O
found O
ready O
to O
answer O
the O
largest O
drafts O
that O
could O
be O
drawn O
upon O
her O
good O
offices O
, O
while O
the O
cheerfulness O
of O
her O
mind O
reflected O
itself O
on O
all O

If O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
her O
young O
friends O
rushed O
joyously O
forward O
to O
announce O
some O
unexpected O
success O

Marion's S-PERSON
features O
seemed O
as O
if O
they O
had O
been O
put O
together O
only O
for O
smiles O

laughter O
, O
while O
her O
bright O
eye O
glittered O
with O
instant O
gladness O
, O
and O
a O
glow O
of O
color O
mounted O
to O
her O
dimpling O
cheek O

as O
she O
felt O

expressed O
with O
spontaneous O
warmth O
all O
that O
kindness O
could O
dictate O

more O

if O
some O
unforeseen O
affliction O
visited O
the O
hearts O
of O
her O
juvenile O
associates O
, O
there O
seemed O
no O
limits O
to O
the O
patience O

listened O

to O
the O
eager O
assiduity O

The O
most O

never O
overlooked O
, O
were O
it O
merely O
the O
tying O
of O
a O
string O

or O
the O
picking O
up O
of O
a O
handkerchief O
, O

she O
did O
with O
a O
good O

those O

appreciated O

are O
a O
conspicuous O
embroidery O
laid O
on O

With O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
every O
kind O
and O
generous O
feeling O
was O
as O
natural O
as O
perfume O
to O
the O
violet O
, O
and O
equally O
inseparable O
from O
her O
daily O
existence O

ideas O
were O
fresh O

vivid O
, O

her O
manner O
was O
thoroughly O
fascinating O

thoroughly O
feminine O

at O
the O
same O
time O
that O
all O
the O
grace O
of O
look O

expression O
added O
a O
surpassing O
charm O
to O
her O
lively O

intelligent O
conversation O

every O
word O
of O

sprang O
from O

full O
of O
natural O
emotion O

straightforward O
sentiments O

During O
a O
long O

tedious O
illness O

with O
which O
Clara S-PERSON
was O
seized O
, O
a O
short O
time O
before O
leaving O
school O

she O
testified O
a O
tender O
and O
almost O
exclusive O
affection O
for O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
who O
spent O
all O
her O
leisure O
hours O
— O
or O
rather O
moments O
, O
for O
hours O
were O
scarce O
at O
Mrs. O

— O
in O
the O
most O
assiduous O
attention O
to O
the O
beloved O
invalid O
, O
and O
in O
imbibing O
those O
elements O
of O
good O

those O
feelings O

principles O
of O
religion O
which O
were O
to O
be O
guides O
of O
all O
her O
future O
life O
, O
and O
thus O
she O
became O
, O
before O
long O
, O
an O
enlightened O
, O
well O
informed O
, O
and O
deeply O
pious O
Christian S-NORP
, O
not O
shrinking O
from O
the O
society O
of O
one O
who O
excelled O
herself O
, O
but O
humbly O
and O
gratefully O
seeking O
, O
on O
all O
occasions O
, O
her O
advice O
and O
instruction O
, O
while O
both O
had O
their O
hearts O
filled O
with O
a O
fervent O
desire O
, O
steadily O
and O
consistently O
to O
pursue O
their O
own O
best O
interests O

an O
anxious O

benefit O
others O
, O
in O
all O
the O
troubles O
and O
sorrows O
of O
life O
, O
though O
Marion S-PERSON
was O
apt O
to O
feel O
like O
the O
poet O
, O
— O
Ready O
to O
aid O

that O
it O

, O
There O
are O
no O

dreams O

Marion's S-PERSON
health O
and O
spirits O
were O
refreshed O
and O
invigorated O
by O
frequent O
excursions O
to O
visit O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
who O
endeared O
himself O
to O
his O
eager O
young O
auditors O
, O
Henry S-PERSON
and O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
by O
expatiating O
with O
all O
the O
freshness O
of O
youth O
, O
to O
their O
wondering O
ears O
, O
on O
the O
times O
long O
past O
, O
when O
holidays O

romping O
, O
sight O
- O
seeing O

birth O
- O
days O
, O
and O
festivals O
, O
were O
still O
in O
fashion O
, O
but O
these O
were O
the O
days O
of O
his O
own O
boyhood O
, O
before O
children O
were O
too O
wise O
and O
busy O
to O
have O
time O
for O
natural O
enjoyment O
. O
The O
Admiral O
was O
thought O
, O
by O
Mrs. O
Penfold S-PERSON
, O
a O
sad O
marplot O
, O
having O
already O
, O
as O
she O
knew O
, O
done O
all O
in O
his O
power O
to O
dissuade O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
from O
placing O
the O
" O
little O
fairy O
, O
" O
as O
he O
called O
his O
favorite O
, O
in O
such O
a O
tread O
- O
mill O
as O
her O
school O
- O
room O
, O
where O
he O
said O
the O
only O
knowledge O
to O
be O
acquired O
was O
, O
that O
knowledge O
of O
the O
world O
which O
ruins O
the O
heart O
, O
and O
where O
fascination O
was O
to O
be O
taught O
as O
one O
of O
the O
fine O
arts O
, O
but O
all O
his O
representations O
, O
whether O
in O
jest O
or O
in O
earnest O
, O
were O
in O
vain O
. O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
, O
being O
the O
guardian O
of O
both O
his O
sisters O
, O
had O
determined O
to O
expend O
a O
considerable O
part O
of O
the O
provision O
bequeathed O
by O
their O
father O
in O
training O
them O
up O
as O
carefully O
, O
for O
the O
course O
of O
fashionable O
life O
, O
as O
he O
would O
have O
trained O
a O
promising O
race O
- O
horse O
which O
was O
expected O
to O
win O
the B-FAC
St. I-FAC
Leger E-FAC
, O
confidently O
anticipating O
a O
short O
and O
brilliant O
career O
of O
admiration O
and O
success O
, O
ending O
with O
a O
splendid O
trousseau O
, O
a O
chariot O
and O
four S-CARDINAL
, O
and O
a O
profusion O
of O
wedding O
favors O
. O
Even O
the O
gay O
, O
frolicsome O
Caroline B-PERSON
Smythe E-PERSON
, O
many O
years O
older O
than O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
and O
the O
most O
seditious O
and O
unruly O
of O
pupils O
, O
became O
speedily O
tamed O
down O
to O
mechanical O
obedience O
at O
school O
, O
where O
, O
losing O
her O
naturally O
intense O
enjoyment O
of O
mere O
existence O
, O
she O
seemed O
at O
best O
almost O
a O
habitual O
drudge O
in O
the O
usual O
routine O
of O
labor O
. O
There O
was O
a O
mystery O
never O
apparently O
to O
be O
fathomed O
about O
this O
lively O
girl O
, O
which O
excited O
the O
most O
intense O
curiosity O
among O
her O
companions O
, O
but O
though O
she O
was O
gifted O
with O
an O
extraordinary O
degree O
of O
volubility O
, O
which O
astonished O
and O
diverted O
the O
whole O
school O
, O
talking O
in O
a O
rapid O
and O
irregular O
manner O
of O
all O
events O
, O
past O
, O
present O
, O
or O
to O
come O
, O
with O
a O
brilliant O
confusion O
of O
drollery O
and O
humor O
, O
still O
she O
never O
dropped O
a O
hint O
which O
threw O
the O
most O
transient O
light O
on O
her O
own O
situation O
and O
affairs O
. O
No O
one O
knew O
whence O
she O
came O
or O
who O
she O
was O
, O
but O
though O
defying O
all O
the O
powers O
of O
all O
the O
masters O
to O
render O
her O
accomplished O
, O
yet O
Mrs. O
Penfold S-PERSON
evidently O
treated O
her O
with O
extraordinary O
consideration O
, O
and O
almost O
with O
respect O
. O
Many O
were O
the O
restrictions O
and O
directions O
given O
respecting O
her O
to O
the O
scholars O
and O
teachers O
, O
which O
seemed O
to O
them O
most O
unaccountable O
, O
and O
several O
of O
which O
were O
voted O
by O
the O
juvenile O
community O
to O
be O
so O
peculiarly O
barbarous O
and O
oppressive O
, O
that O
though O
the O
young O
lady O
herself O
seemed O
neither O
surprised O
nor O
annoyed O
by O
the O
rigid O
watchfulness O
exercised O
over O
all O
her O
motions O
, O
it O
excited O
among O
her O
companions O
an O
indignant O
pity O
, O
and O
a O
keen O
spirit O
of O
partizanship O
. O
She O
was O
never O
on O
any O
occasion O
known O
to O
walk O
with O
the O
governesses O
and O
the O
other O
girls O
beyond O
the O
narrow O
limits O
of O
the O
high O
garden O
walls O
, O
and O
on O
Sundays S-DATE
, O
instead O
of O
attending O
the O
parish O
church O
, O
it O
was O
observed O
that O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
teachers O
invariably O
remained O
at O
home O
to O
read O
prayers O
with O
her O
. O
No O
general O
invitations O
sent O
for O
all O
the O
pupils O
by O
the O
friends O
of O
other O
girls O
, O
were O
ever O
accepted O
for O
Caroline S-PERSON

who O
had O
special O
permission O
to O
visit O
with O
Marion S-PERSON
at O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
Dunbar's E-PERSON
, O
but O
at O
no O
other O
house O
in O
the O
visible O
world O
. O
She O
never O
spoke O
of O
home O
, O
— O
received O
no O
letters O
, O
and O
once O
only O
had O
a O
visitor O
, O
an O
object O
of O
keen O
and O
eager O
scrutiny O
to O
the O
little O
gossiping O
community O
of O
Dartmore B-ORG
House E-ORG
, O
who O
discovered O
nothing O
more O
, O
however O
, O
than O
that O
Caroline's S-PERSON
aunt O
, O
Mrs. O
Smythe S-PERSON
, O
was O
a O
gay O
, O
fantastic O
- O
looking O
, O
showily O

dressed O
little O
woman O
of O
no O
certain O
age O
, O
for O
whom O
her O
niece O
seemed O
to O
care O
very O
little O
, O
as O
the O
whole O
flood O
of O
her O
affections O
was O
concentrated O
on O
her O
companions O
at O
school O
. O
Money O
she O
had O
in O
the O
most O
lavish O
abundance O
, O
while O
she O
squandered O
it O
with O
a O
degree O
of O
reckless O
, O
and O
almost O
contemptuous O
profusion O
, O
perfectly O
startling O
to O
those O
who O
scarcely O
received O
as O
much O
in O
a O
year O
as O
she O
seemed O
able O
to O
spend O
in O
a B-DATE
day E-DATE
on O
presents O
for O
those O
she O
loved O

which O
was O
the O
chief O
use O

her O
large O
funds O
were O
devoted O

Marion S-PERSON
, O
the O
companion O
and O
pet O
of O
her O
two S-CARDINAL
elder O
companions O
, O
Clara S-PERSON
and O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
tried O
with O
all O
her O
powers O
to O
extend O
her O
affection O
also O
to O
Mrs. O
Penfold S-PERSON
, O
but O
her O
feelings O
found O
nothing O
to O
feed O
upon O
in O
the O
cold O
, O
formal O
, O
rigid O
manner O
, O
and O
stern O
upright O
appearance O
of O
the O
schoolmistress O
, O
who O
repelled O
all O
intercourse O
with O
her O
pupils O
, O
considering O
them O
necessary O
grievances O
to O
be O

in O
her O
house O

as O
a O
source O

not O

Towards O
these O
little O

, O
driven O
from O
task O
to O
task O
with O
ceaseless O
pertinacity O
, O
no O
confidence O
was O
shown O

and O
between O
them O
conversation O

systematically O
discouraged O

A O
governess O
was O
appointed O
to O
sleep O
in O
each O
room O
to O
secure O
silence O
among O

pupils O

few O
of O
whom O
had O
that O
glow O
of O
heart O
and O
imagination O
peculiar O
to O
Marion S-PERSON

and O
it O
was O
fortunate O
, O
perhaps O
, O
that O
her O
large O
stock O
of O
sympathy O
was O
not O
more O
frequently O
in O
requisition O

as O
the O
most O
astounding O
confidences O
were O
sometimes O
imparted O
to O

One S-CARDINAL
young O
lady O
, O
in O
a O
high O
fever O
of O
romance O
, O
described O
to O
Marion S-PERSON
at O
great O
length O
, O
in O
the O
strictest O
confidence O
, O
an O
elopement O
which O
took O
place O
from O
the O
school O
where O
she O
had O
last O
been O
educated O
, O
on O
which O
occasion O
the O
young O
narrator O
had O
accompanied O
the O
bride O
part O
of O
her O
way O
, O
and O
returned O
home O
without O
detection O
, O
by O
climbing O
in O
at O
an O
open O
window O

Another O
of O
the O
pupils O
asked O

not O
think O
Monsieur B-PERSON
D'Ambereau E-PERSON

the O
Italian S-NORP
master O

a O
third S-ORDINAL
of O
Marion's S-NORP
young O
friends O
pointed O
out O
to O
her O
notice O

many O
a O
ringlet O
appeared O

Marion S-PERSON

a O
sufficient O
object O
in O
view O
, O
every O
time O
she O
entered O
a O

from O
the O
desire O
she O
felt O
to O
please O
all O
with O
whom O
she O
associated O

which O
gave O
a O
vent O

seeking O
the O
reciprocal O
attachment O

many O

shut O
out O

her O
sunshine O

her O

a O
monotonous O

uneventful O
life O
of O

snatched O

the O

caught O
at O

it O
increased O
in O
weight O

urgency O
every O

throwing O
occasionally O
a O
shadow O
of O
care O
over O
that O
bright O

in O

so O
beaming O

Marion S-PERSON
tried O
often O
to O

during O

" O
the O
mortifying O
fact O
forced O
itself O
upon O

observation O

that O

so O
irregularly O

Mrs. O

often O
dryly O
remarked O

in O
the O
hearing O
of O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
that O
" O
short O

" O
An O
appeal O
to O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
for O
his O
interference O
often O
occasionally O
suggested O
itself O
to O
the O
mind O
of O
Marion S-PERSON
| | O
but O
she O
knew O
that O
his O
influence O
was O
less O
than O
nothing O
, O
and O
she O
greatly O
feared O
lest O
his O
vehement O
partiality O
to O
herself O
might O
lead O
him O
to O
overlook O
the O
very O
limited O
nature O
of O
his O
income O
, O
and O
to O
volunteer O
some O
generous O
sacrifice O
, O
such O
as O
she O
would O
rather O
suffer O
any O
privations O

The O
pension O
and O
half S-CARDINAL
- O
pay O
of O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
very O
barely O
sufficed O
, O
she O
knew O
, O
to O
defray O
his O
extensive O
charities O
, O
and O
to O
furnish O
sometimes O
the O
hospitable O
table O
, O
and O
the O
bottle O
of O
first S-ORDINAL

rate O
claret O
, O
round O
which O
it O
was O
his O
delight O
to O
gather O
a O
frequent O
circle O
of O
old O
brother O
admirals O

but O
his O
purse O
was O
little O
calculated O
to O
stand O
the O
shock O
of O
such O
a O
draft O
as O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
would O
unhesitatingly O
have O
drawn O
upon O
it O
, O
had O
the O
idea O
occurred O
to O
him O
that O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
might O
perhaps O
be O
induced O
to O
take O
Marion's S-PERSON
school O
bills O
upon O
himself O
. O
In O
no O
instance O
was O
it O
more O
obvious O
than O
in O
that O
of O

how O
precisely O

He O
was O
, O
like O
his O

pre-eminently O
handsome O
, O
while O
the O
hauteur O
of O
his O
demeanor O
, O
bordering O
on O
a O
sort O
of O
well O
- O
bred O
contempt O
for O
others O
, O
rendered O
his O
slightest O
notice O
an O
event O
of O
considerable O
magnitude O
even O
to O
many O
whom O
the O
world O
might O
have O
deemed O
his O
superiors O
in O
rank O
, O
fortune O

There O
were O
a O
few O
exclusives O
, O
however O
, O
among O
his O
own O
exclusive O
set O

he O
admitted O
to O
the O
most O
unbounded O
familiarity O

good O
fellowship O
, O
inviting O
them O
to O
entertainments O

more O

an O
ostentatious O
display O

any O

profusion O
in O

unchecked O

one S-CARDINAL
sentiment O
of O
justice O

of O
prudence O
, O
the O
young O
Baronet S-PERSON
obtained O
universal O
celebrity O
for O
his O
generosity O

good O
humor O

— O
anecdotes O

which O
were O

He O
was O

presented O
the O
next O

to O
Clara B-PERSON

he O
sent O
Marion S-PERSON

magnificent O
rosewood O
box O
, O
filled O
with O
crystal O
perfume O
bottles O
, O

gold O

which O
cost O
twenty B-QUANTITY

when O
at O
that O
very O
time O
she O
had O
scarcely O
a O

on O

was O
in O
agonies O

Sir O

roundly O
estimated O

at O
£ O
20,000 S-MONEY

year O

his O
rent O

paid O

regularly O
for O

but O
while O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
made O
it O
a O
matter O
of O
accurate O
calculation O
to O
train O
Marion S-PERSON
with O
skill O
and O
sagacity O
in O
the O
way O
most O
likely O
to O
take O
her O
speedily O
off O
his O
hands O
, O
yet O
it O
was O
no O
part O
of O
his O
calculation O
to O
pay O
for O
anything O
in O
money O
if O
he O
could O
do O
so O
in O

he O
rattled O
off O
whole O

a O
dice O

raced O
himself O

privately O

embarrassments O
should O
always O
remain O
both O
out O
of O
sight O

out O
of O
mind O
. O
Mrs. O
Penfold's S-PERSON
grave O
and O
dry O
expression O
of O
countenance O
became O
graver O

drier O

contemplated O
the O
rapidly O
- O
increasing O
amount O
of O
Marion's S-PERSON
bill O
, O
while O
she O
urgently O
impressed O
on O
her O
pupil's O
mind O
the O
absolute O
necessity O
of O
entreating O
more O
zealously O
than O
ever O
for O
the O
speedy O
payment O
of O
such O
very O
old O
scores O
. O
Observing O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
so O
exceedingly O
profuse O
in O
his O
expenditure O
, O
however O
, O
Mrs. O

believed O
there O
could O
be O
no O
cause O

apprehend O
any O
defalcation O

at O
any O

defray O
her O
demands O
with O
ease O
, O
though O
the O
only O
thing O
he O
never O
found O
it O
convenient O
to O
command O
was O
ready O
money O

Marion S-PERSON
soon O
discovered O
that O
it O
made O
him O
frantic O
with O
ill O

humor O

be O
asked O
for O

accidentally O
heard O
Sir O

laughingly O
complain O
during O
her O
mid-summer O
holidays O
at O
home O
, O
to O
Mr. O

In O
all O
the O
pride O

Marion S-PERSON
soon O

up O

displayed O
her O
glittering O

afraid O
to O
be O
suspected O
of O
conferring O
a O
favor O

with O
intuitive O
delicacy O
she O
asked O
Sir O

to O
take O
charge O

it O

the O
young O
Baronet S-PERSON
mechanically O
dropped O
the O
sovereigns O
into O
his O
pocket O

where O
sovereigns O
in O
general O

a O
very O

drew O
out O

ventured O
one B-DATE

with O
glowing O

was O
so O

the O
two S-CARDINAL
young O

seated O
in O
an O
arbor O
at O
the O
extreme O
verge O
of O
the O
bounds O
prescribed O
by O
Mrs. O
Penfold S-PERSON
, O
in O
earnest O
conversation O
, O
while O
watching O
with O
delight O
the O
declining O
sun O
, O
which O
superbly O
illuminated O
a O
heavy O
mass O
of O
clouds O
in O
the O
western O
horizon O

Time O
flew O
on O
, O
and O
darkness O
nearly O
closed O
around O
them O
while O
they O
discussed O
with O
lively O

careless O
humor O
, O
all O
the O
petty O
annoyances O

the B-TIME

Marion S-PERSON
felt O
that O
the O
high O
exhilarating O
key O
in O
which O
Caroline S-PERSON
spoke O
, O
and O
her O
gay O
, O
well O
- O
rung O
- O
out O
laugh O
, O
made O
her O
almost O
nervous O
in O
the O
obscure O
and O
solitary O
retreat O
to O
which O
they O
had O
withdrawn O

but O
ashamed O
of O
her O
own O
timidity O
, O
she O
determined O
to O
conquer O
or O
conceal O
it O
. O
Marion S-PERSON
was O
flattered O
when O
a O
companion O
like O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
some O
years O
older O
than O
herself O
, O
thus O
treated O
her O
with O
familiarity O

though O
certainly O
, O
neither O
on O
this O
occasion O
, O
nor O
on O
any O
other O
, O
was O
it O
with O
confidence O
, O
as O
no O
living O
being O
seemed O
entirely O
in O
the O
confidence O
of O
Miss O
Smythe S-PERSON
, O
who O
, O
while O
she O
appeared O
gayly O
and O
heedlessly O
to O
rattle O
on O
in O
conversation O
, O
yet O
kept O
a O
cautious O
silence O
respecting O
all O
that O
concerned O
herself O

Many O
very O
reserved O
persons O
pass O
for O

perfectly O
open O

by O
means O
of O
a O
frank O
, O
free O
manner O

by O
speaking O
in O
a O
confidential O
tone O
concerning O
the O
most O
private O
affairs O
of O
those O
with O
whom O
they O
converse O
| | O
and O
this O
Caroline S-PERSON
did O
to O
excess O
, O
asking O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
with O
every O
appearance O
of O
kindness O
, O
a O
hundred S-CARDINAL
questions O
, O
which O
in O
her O
own O
case O
she O
either O
could O
not O
, O
or O
would O
not O
have O
answered O
, O
and O
testifying O
the O
most O
cordial O
, O
unfeigned O
interest O
in O
all O
that O
related O
to O
the O
prospects O
or O
feelings O
of O
her O
companion O
, O
who O
never O
attempted O
to O
conceal O
a O
wish O
or O
a O
thought O
, O
and O
often O
forgot O
that O
the O
trust O
was O
not O
mutual O
. O
Caroline S-PERSON
was O
talking O
eagerly O
with O
great O
animation O
, O
and O
telling O
Marion S-PERSON
that O
the O
only O
injury O
she O
never O
would O
forgive O
, O
was O
, O
if O
any O
of O
those O
she O
loved O
had O
a O
sorrow O
that O
did O
not O
allow O
her O
to O
share O
with O
them O

and O
especially O
if O
they O
permitted O
themselves O
to O
suffer O
from O
any O
pecuniary O
difficulties O
which O
it O
was O
within O
her O
power O
to O
relieve O
, O
when O
suddenly O
Marion S-PERSON
laid O
a O
hand O
on O
her O
arm O
, O
making O
a O
hurried O
signal O
for O
silence O
, O
while O
she O
whispered O
in O
a O
low O
undertone O
, O
" O
I O
have O
scarcely O
heard O
you O
for O
the B-TIME
last I-TIME
five I-TIME
minutes E-TIME

Did O
you O
observe O
that O
strange O

looking O
man O
, O
very O
much O
muffled O
up O
, O
who O
scrambled O
several B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
ago E-TIME
to O
the O
top O
of O
the O
garden O
- O
wall O
? O
He O
was O
staring O
wildly O
about O
him O
for O
some O
time O
, O
then O
gliding O
noiselessly O
down O
, O
and O
has O
suddenly O
disappeared O
? O
" O
" O
Where O
? O
where O
? O
" O
whispered O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
grasping O
Marion's S-PERSON
hand O
with O
a O
look O
of O
wild O
alarm O
, O
and O
speaking O
in O
a O
low O
, O
hoarse O
tone O
of O
extreme O
terror O
. O
" O
For O
your O
life O
, O
Marion S-PERSON

do O
not O

traced O
me O
out O

" O
Who O
? O
" O
asked O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
bewildered O
and O
terrified O
, O
when O
she O
beheld O
a O
degree O
of O
frantic O
alarm O
depicted O
on O
the O
countenance O
of O
her O
companion O
, O
which O
seemed O
almost O
unaccountable O
. O
" O
Dear O
Caroline S-PERSON
! O
whom O
do O
you O
fear O
? O
" O
" O
A O
madman O

replied O
Miss O
Smythe S-PERSON

in O
accents O
of O
mingled O
anger O
and O
disgust O
. O
" O

even O
adopted O

you O
never O

sends O
me O

follows O
me O

church O

throws O
stones O
at O
my O
windows O

the O
night O

frightens O
my O
very O
life O
out O

the O
law O
leaves O
me O
unprotected O

commits O
no O

It O
was O
to O
avoid O
him O

Caroline S-PERSON

lost O
all O
command O

herself O
in O
the O
agony O
of O
her O
fear O

poured O
out O
a O
flood O
of O
words O
in O
the O
rapid O

subdued O
accents O
of O
extreme O
terror O

she O
retreated O
into O
the O
darkest O
corner O

the O
arbor O

screen O
herself O
from O
observation O

hastily O
dragging O
Marion S-PERSON
along O

the O

Caroline S-PERSON
bent O
her O

eagerly O
forward O

grasped O
Marion's S-PERSON

replied O
the O
stranger O
, O
in O
a O
voice O
which O
sounded O
harsh O
and O
excited O
, O
while O
the O
deep O
, O
full O
tones O
appeared O
to O
Marion S-PERSON
as O
if O
she O
had O
heard O
them O
before O

but O
the O
darkness O
prevented O
her O
from O
seeing O
him O
distinctly O
, O
even O
if O
his O
dress O
had O
not O
been O
sufficient O
to O
disguise O
him O
from O
the O
most O
penetrating O
eye O

added O

accents O

increasing O
wildness O

The O
madman's O
voice O
, O
which O
had O
been O
loud O
and O
vehement O
, O
here O
dropped O
into O
a O
low O
, O
stern O
, O
inaudible O
murmur O
, O
and O
his O
hand O
plunged O
into O
the O
breast O
of O
his O
coat O
, O
seemed O
as O
if O
it O
grasped O
some O
weapon O
there O
, O
while O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
taking O
advantage O
of O
his O
pre-occupied O
attention O
, O
darted O
off O
with O
the O
speed O
of O
thought O

and O
almost O
as O
noiselessly O
fled O

the O
house O

A O
loud O
, O
angry O
cry O
to O
stop O
her O

mingled O
with O
curses O

imprecations O

from O
the O
madman O
, O
while O
he O
waved O
his O
singularly O
long O
arms O
menacingly O
above O
his O
head O
, O
only O
accelerated O
her O
pace O
, O
while O
he O
followed O
some O
steps O
in O
pursuit O

terror O
gave O
wings O
to O
her O
feet O

rushing O
into O
the O
entrance O
- O
hall O
, O
she O
instantly O
rang O
the O
large O
dinner O
bell O

raised O
an O
alarm O

assembled O
the O
whole O
household O

all O
of O
whom O
gazed O
with O
looks O
of O
panic O

struck O
astonishment O
at O
Marion's S-PERSON
pale O
and O
ghastly O
countenance O

Not O
a O
moment O
required O
to O
be O
lost O
in O
explanation O
, O
for O
Mrs. O
Penfold S-PERSON
seemed O
at O
once O
to O
guess O
the O
whole O
nature O
and O
extent O
of O
Caroline's O
danger O
, O
the O
instant O
her O
name O
was O
mentioned O

therefore O
Marion S-PERSON
had O
but O
to O
point O
out O
the O
direction O
in O
which O
she O
might O
be O
found O
, O
when O
Mrs. O
Penfold S-PERSON
hastened O
forward O
, O
preceded O
by O
several O
of O
the O
more O
active O
servants O
. O
When O
Marion S-PERSON
had O
rapidly O
executed O
some O
orders O
committed O
to O
her O
she O
quickly O
returned O
towards O
the O
arbor O
, O
but O
not O
a O
trace O
remained O
there O
of O
any O
one O
. O
The O
little O
table O
had O
been O
upset O
, O
several O
branches O
torn O
down O
that O
surrounded O
the O
entrance O
, O
and O
the O
grass O
beneath O
was O
much O
trampled O
and O
disfigured O

all O
was O
silent O

deserted O
. O
After O
one S-CARDINAL
hurried O
glance O
of O
alarm O
and O
perplexity O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
hastened O
forward O
to O
the O
garden O
gate O
, O
which O
she O
found O
had O
been O
violently O
burst O
open O
, O
and O
on O
emerging O
into O
the O
high O
road O
beyond O
, O
she O
there O
found O
Mrs. O
Penfold S-PERSON
and O
her O
servants O
all O
crowding O
round O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
who O
remained O
in O
a O
dead O
faint O
on O
the O
ground O
for O
nearly B-TIME
half I-TIME
an I-TIME
hour E-TIME
. O
A O
carriage O
was O
rapidly O
disappearing O
at O
full O
speed O
in O
the O
distance O
, O
but O
already O
almost O
too O
far O
off O
to O
be O
distinguished O
| | O
and O
Marion S-PERSON
perceived O
the O
figure O
of O
a O
man O
lurking O
behind O
the O
hedge O
close O
beside O
her O
| | O
but O
when O
she O
made O
it O
evident O
that O
he O
was O
observed O
, O
he O
rushed O
close O
up O
to O
her O
side O
, O
saying O
, O
in O
a O
threatening O
tone O
, O
between O
his O
clenched O
teeth O
, O
" O
You O
have O
provoked O
a O
madman O
! O
" O
Scarcely O
had O
Marion S-PERSON
time O
to O
utter O
an O
exclamation O
of O
sudden O
affright O
, O
before O
he O
sprung O
over O
the O
hedge O
, O
and O
was O
seen O
running O
across O
the O
neighboring O
fields O
, O
until O
his O
figure O
mingled O
with O
the O
surrounding O
gloom O
, O
and O
vanished O
out O
of O
sight O
. O
Mrs. O
Penfold's S-PERSON
chief O
care O
, O
after O
Caroline's S-PERSON
recovery O
from O
her O
alarming O
swoon O
, O
was O
earnestly O
to O
enjoin O
that O
the O
circumstances O
of O
this O
adventure O
should O
never O
be O
mentioned O
, O
or O
so O
much O
as O
remembered O
by O
those O
who O
had O
witnessed O
them O
| | O
a O
story O
so O
extraordinary O
and O
alarming O
, O
being O
likely O
to O
injure O
her O
establishment O
, O
besides O
causing O
much O
unnecessary O
gossip O
among O
the O
younger O
pupils O
| | O
but O
had O
Marion S-PERSON
ever O
been O
disposed O
to O
consign O
, O
as O
desired O
, O
the O
whole O
adventure O
to O
oblivion O
, O
she O
could O
not O
but O
be O
continually O
reminded O
of O
it O
for O
several B-DATE
weeks E-DATE
afterwards O
, O
by O
the O
startled O
and O
agitated O
manner O
of O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
whose O
frolicsome O
spirits O
had O
entirely O
deserted O
her O
, O
while O
she O
seemed O
for O
some O
time O
to O
be O
in O
imminent O
danger O
of O
a O
nervous O
fever O
. O
If O
any O
one O
appeared O
suddenly O
in O
the O
room O
, O
she O
almost O
screamed O
with O
the O
start O
it O
occasioned O
her O
| | O
she O
could O
not O
bear O
for O
a O
moment O
to O
be O
left O
alone O
, O
and O
seemed O
as O
if O
continually O
listening O
, O
even O
when O
safe O
in O
the O
house O
, O
for O
the O
sound O
of O
steps O
in O
pursuit O
of O
her O
. O
Gradually O
, O
however O
, O
her O
mind O
became O
more O
composed O
, O
and O
she O
ventured O
one B-DATE
day E-DATE
to O
take O
a O
stroll O
with O
Marion S-PERSON
in O
some O
of O
the O
nearer O
parts O
of O
the O
garden O
, O
though O
even O
there O
she O
scarcely O
spoke O
above O
her O
breath O
, O
and O
turning O
hastily O
round O
several O
times O
, O
as O
if O
apprehensive O
that O
some O
one O
approached O
. O
Had O
the O
far O
- O
famed O
Upas O
tree O
grown O
over O
the O
arbor O
, O
Caroline S-PERSON
could O
scarcely O
have O
shunned O
more O
fearfully O
the O
slightest O
approach O
in O
that O
direction O
, O
and O
with O
equal O
care O
did O
she O
avoid O
any O
allusion O
to O
what O
had O
occurred O
there O
, O
not O
a O
hint O
of O
which O
ever O
transpired O
in O
her O
most O
confidential O
moments O
. O
The O
very O
sound O
of O
her O
own O
feet O
on O
the O
gravel O
seemed O
to O
startle O
her O
, O
and O
as O
she O
walked O
beneath O
the O
shade O
of O
some O
tall O
forest O
trees O
which O
overhung O
the O
garden O
- O
wall O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
observed O
that O
Caroline S-PERSON
trod O
more O
cautiously O
| | O
and O
though O
she O
dropped O
not O
a O
word O
respecting O
her O
feelings O
or O
fears O
, O
it O
was O
evident O
that O
her O
nerves O
were O
strung O
to O
an O
agony O
of O
sensitiveness O
, O
for O
the O
fluttering O
of O
a O
bird O
in O
the O
hedge O
, O
or O
the O
fall O
of O
a O
leaf O
, O
made O
her O
start O
, O
and O
she O
seemed O
about O
at O
last O
to O
give O
up O
the O
point O
in O
despair O
, O
and O
hurry O
homewards O
, O
when O
suddenly O
a O
loud O
shrill O
whistle O
arose O
amidst O
the O
branches O
of O
an O
ash O
- O
tree O
, O
almost O
directly O
over O
their O
heads O
, O
and O
before O
Marion S-PERSON
had O
time O
to O
look O
round O
, O
a O
small O
packet O
had O
dropped O
at O
the O
feet O
of O
Caroline S-PERSON
. O
With O
a O
half S-CARDINAL
- O
suppressed O
cry O
of O
alarm O
, O
the O
terrified O
girl O
fled O
, O
while O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
scarcely O
less O
frightened O
, O
instinctively O
picked O
up O
the O
parcel O
, O
and O
followed O
, O
while O
again O
she O
was O
pursued O
by O
a O
volley O
of O
oaths O
and O
imprecations O
, O
which O
ended O
in O
a O
laugh O
so O
wild O
, O
so O
maniacal O
, O
and O
so O
fearful O
, O
that O
for O
months S-DATE
afterwards O
it O
rung O
in O
her O
ears O
, O
causing O
her O
a O
shudder O
of O
horror O
and O
alarm O
. O
When O
Mrs. O
Penfold S-PERSON
tore O
open O
an O
innumerable O
multitude O
of O
seals O
which O
closed O
the O
packet O
addressed O
to O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
she O
discovered O
within O
only O
a O
long O
incoherent O
letter O
of O
several O
sheets O
, O
filled O
with O
the O
most O
extravagant O
professions O
of O
ardent O
love O
, O
and O
the O
most O
vehement O
declarations O
, O
that O
nothing O
on O
earth O
could O
impede O
or O
discourage O
him O
in O
his O
resolution O
to O
carry O
her O
off O
, O
which O
he O
seemed O
still O
persuaded O
, O
with O
the O
self O
- O
delusion O
peculiar O
to O
madness O
, O
must O
be O
a O
welcome O
assurance O
to O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
whose O
words O
and O
actions O
he O
perseveringly O
attributed O
to O
the O
arbitrary O
influence O
of O
others O
. O
Accompanying O
this O
farrago O
of O
most O
intolerable O
nonsense O
, O
was O
a O
black O
shade O
in O
a O
wooden O
frame O
, O
representing O
the O
profile O
of O
a O
young O
man O
, O
certainly O
handsome O
, O
and O
which O
seemed O
to O
Marion S-PERSON
like O
features O
she O
had O
known O
elsewhere O
, O
but O
being O
frequently O
addicted O
to O
observing O
resemblances O
, O
she O
felt O
at O
once O
persuaded O
that O
this O
must O
be O
some O
such O
vague O
and O
unaccountable O
likeness O
as O
she O
had O
frequently O
found O
or O
fancied O
before O
. O
Time O
wore O
on O
, O
and O
still O
Caroline S-PERSON
lingered O
at O
school O
, O
unwilling O
apparently O
to O
forsake O
the O
comparative O
quietness O
of O
Mrs. O
Penfold's S-PERSON
, O
where O
, O
though O
her O
age O
exceeded O
by O
some B-DATE
years E-DATE
that O
of O
the O
other O
pupils O
, O
and O
though O
her O
cotemporary O
Clara S-PERSON
had O
been O
already O
introduced O
into O
society O
, O
she O
still O
seemed O
anxious O
to O
forget O
herself O
and O
her O
affairs O
in O
the O
multitude O
of O
her O
masters O
and O
studies O
, O
so O
completely O
was O
she O
engrossed O
by O
which O
, O
that O
she O
evidently O
grudged O
every O
moment O
and O
every O
thought O
which O
interrupted O
her O
progress O
. O
At O
length O
, O
on O
the O
evening O
previous O
to O
that O
fixed O
on O
for O
her O
final O
departure O
from O
school O
, O
when O
Mrs. O
Smythe S-PERSON
was O
expected O
to O
convey O
her O
home O
, O
Mrs. O
Penfold S-PERSON
was O
bestowing O
on O
Caroline S-PERSON
some O
of O
her O
last O
advice O
, O
of O
the O
most O
approved O
mode O
of O
" O
getting O
on O
" O
in O
society O
, O
and O
especially O
on O
the O
manners O
and O
conversation O
most O
attractive O
to O
gentlemen O
, O
when O
a O
note O
was O
brought O
into O
the O
room O
, O
which O
had O
arrived O
by O
express O
, O
bringing O
the O
melancholy O
intelligence O
that O
Mrs. O
Smythe's S-PERSON
carriage O
had O
been O
upset O
a B-QUANTITY
few I-QUANTITY
miles E-QUANTITY
off O
, O
causing O
so O
severe O
a O
blow O
on O
the O
head O
, O
that O
a O
concussion O
of O
the O
brain O
had O
taken O
place O
, O
and O
she O
continued O
insensible O
, O
at O
a O
village O
some B-QUANTITY
miles E-QUANTITY
off O
, O
where O
little O
hope O
remained O
of O
her O
recovery O
. O
The O
Doctor O
who O
wrote O
these O
hurried O
particulars O
had O
obligingly O
sent O
his O
own O
carriage O
and O
servant O
to O
accompany O
Miss O
Smythe S-PERSON
to O
the O
spot O
, O
that O
she O
might O
take O
a O
last O
leave O
of O
her O
dying O
relative O
, O
and O
he O
recommended O
that O
she O
should O
not O
lose O
an O
instant O
, O
or O
it O
might O
be O
too O
late O
to O
find O
the O
sufferer O
in O
life O
. O
Struck O
with O
grief O
and O
consternation O
by O
this O
most O
unexpected O
and O
calamitous O
intelligence O
, O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
though O
she O
had O
never O
before O
seemed O
much O
to O
love O
her O
aunt O
, O
yet O
now O
became O
overwhelmed O
with O
the O
shock O
, O
and O
lost O
not O
an O
instant O
in O
hastily O
preparing O
to O
obey O
the O
melancholy O
summons O
, O
by O
throwing O
on O
her O
coat O
and O
bonnet O
, O
while O
she O
rushed O
into O
the O
arms O
of O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
and O
burst O
into O
an O
agony O
of O
tears O
in O
bidding O
her O
farewell O
. O
The O
French S-NORP
governess O
who O
had O
been O
summoned O
to O
escort O
Caroline S-PERSON
in O
the O
carriage O
, O
was O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
those O
nervous O
persons O
, O
who O
became O
perfectly O
frantic O
when O
hurried O
, O
and O
she O
flew O
about O
the O
room O
, O
uttering O
a O
volley O
of O
incoherent O
exclamations O
, O
expressive O
of O
her O
wonder O
and O
perplexity O
at O
so O
sudden O
a O
call O
on O
her O
activity O
, O
while O
her O
preparations O
seemed O
to O
make O
no O
visible O
progress O
. O
There O
is O
a O
secret O
, O
mysterious O
pleasure O
in O
being O
waited O
for O
, O
which O
every O
living O
mortal O
seems O
to O
enjoy O
when O
they O
have O
the O
opportunity O

and O
without O
a O
thought O
of O
Caroline's O
impatience O
, O
her O
anxiety O
, O
and O
her O
sorrow O
, O
Madame B-PERSON
D'Aubert E-PERSON
expressed O
the O
most O
eager O
and O
vehement O
solicitude O
about O
her O
own O
dress O
, O
and O
a O
resolution O
not O
to O
stir O
till O
equipped O
to O
her O
entire O
satisfaction O
, O
for O
so O
rare O
and O
almost O
unprecedented O
an O
event O
, O
as O
leaving O
the O
boundaries O
of O
Dartmore B-FAC
House E-FAC
. O
Every O
thing O
that O
has O
a O
limit O
, O
however O
, O
must O
come O
to O
an O
end O
, O
and O
Madame B-PERSON
D'Aubert's E-PERSON
toilette O
being O
at O
last O
completed O
she O
leisurely O
advanced O
, O
talking O
to O
herself O
and O
to O
everybody O
else O
, O
arranging O
her O
shawl O
, O
and O
giving O
a O
last O
finish O
to O
the O
contour O
of O
her O
bonnet O
, O
before O
she O
threw O
herself O
with O
dignified O
deliberation O
into O
the O
chariot O
. O
Marion S-PERSON
had O
affectionately O
insisted O
on O
conveying O
her O
weeping O
friend O
to O
the O
carriage O
, O
while O
, O
with O
all O
the O
little O
arts O
of O
affection O
, O
she O
tried O
to O
console O
and O
encourage O
her O
, O
till O
at O
length O
they O
exchanged O
a O
final O
embrace O
, O
and O
parted O
. O
Scarcely O
, O
however O
, O
had O
Miss O
Smythe S-PERSON
placed O
her O
foot O
upon O
the O
steps O
, O
while O
the O
man-servant O
who O
accompanied O
the O
carriage O
carefully O
assisted O
her O
in O
, O
before O
Marion S-PERSON
suddenly O
sprung O
forward O
with O
an O
exclamation O
of O
terror O
, O
seized O
hold O
of O
Caroline's S-PERSON
dress O
, O
and O
before O
she O
could O
speak O
, O
dragged O
her O
forcibly O
into O
the O
house O
, O
exclaiming O
in O
accents O
almost O
inarticulate O
from O
alarm O
, O
" O
Come O
back O
, O
Caroline S-PERSON
! O
come O
back O
! O
This O
is O
some O
mistake O
! O
some O
dreadful O
trick O
! O
Caroline S-PERSON
! O
dear O
Caroline S-PERSON
! O
come O
back O
! O
That O
servant O
wears O
the O
very O
dress O
of O
the O
person O
who O
attacked O
you O
in O
the O
garden O
! O
I O
cannot O
see O
his O
face O
, O
but O
I O
am O
certain O
it O
is O
he O
! O
" O
Before O
Marion S-PERSON
could O
finish O
her O
sentence O
, O
the O
supposed O
servant O
had O
violently O
seized O
Miss O
Smythe S-PERSON
by O
the O
arms O
, O
and O
was O
about O
forcibly O
to O
drag O
her O
towards O
the O
carriage O
, O
when O
the O
loud O
cries O
of O
Marion S-PERSON
brought O
assistance O
. O
The O
almost O
fainting O
girl O
was O
rescued O
, O
and O
the O
post O
- O
chaise O
secured O

but O
not O
a O
trace O
could O
be O
seen O
of O
the O
madman O
, O
who O
instantly O
vanished O
| | O
and O
the O
post O
- O
boy O
could O
give O
no O
intelligence O
respecting O
him O
, O
except O
that O
he O
had O
been O
ordered O
out O
at O
an O
inn O
close O
by O
, O
in O
urgent O
haste O
, O
that O
evening O
, O
with O
a O
promise O
of O
double O
payment O
if O
he O
implicitly O
obeyed O
the O
gentleman O
, O
who O
seemed O
highly O
irritable O
, O
and O
swore O
at O
him O
in O
a O
most O
fearful O
manner O
, O
if O
he O
made O
the O
slightest O
delay O
, O
or O
so O
much O
as O
asked O
a O
direction O
which O
way O
to O
turn O
. O
The O
most O
diligent O
search O
was O
made O
, O
but O
made O
in O
vain O
, O
by O
the O
officers O
of O
police O
, O
to O
find O
out O
the O
lunatic's O
retreat O
, O
which O
eluded O
their O
utmost O
research O

and O
as O
Caroline B-PERSON
Smythe E-PERSON
was O
privately O
removed O
soon O
afterwards O
from O
school O
, O
where O
the O
subject O
was O
forbidden O
ever O
to O
be O
mentioned O
, O
the O
whole O
story O
seemed O
almost O
buried O
in O
oblivion O
, O
and O
Marion S-PERSON
herself O
felt O
at O
last O
as O
if O
the O
entire O
adventure O
had O
been O
an O
agitating O
dream O
, O
remembered O
by O
no O

no O

of O
the O
most O
frivolous O

accidentally O
gathered O
in O
conversation O
, O
and O
repeated O
again O
in O
society O
like O
a O
parrot O

Formed O
to O
excite O
the O
most O
rapturous O
admiration O
, O
by O
the O
gorgeous O
magnificence O
of O
her O
almost O
regal O
beauty O

while O
nature O
had O
showered O
her O
choicest O
gifts O
on O
Marion S-PERSON

Agnes S-PERSON
was O
brilliant O
without O
being O
interesting O
, O
and O
dazzling O
without O
being O
attractive O
, O
for O
her O
mind O
seemed O
irremediably O

incorrigibly O
vulgar O

selfish O

vain O
. O
A O

the O
only O

Adelines O

Julias S-PERSON
in O
the O
volumes O
which O
she O
read O
with O
surpassing O
diligence O
from O
a O
circulating O
library O

though O
, O
in O
all O
other O
respects O
, O
Agnes S-PERSON
wasted O
her O
time O
amidst O
such O
listless O
idleness O
, O
that O
she O
might O
have O
let O
her O
nails O
grow O

those O
of O
a O
Chinese S-NORP

did O
nothing O

No O
one O

could O
excel O
Agnes S-PERSON

turning O
up O
her O
hands O

eyes O

seldom O
much O
good O
in O
themselves O

Marion S-PERSON
found O
it O
one O
of O
the O
most O
important O
and O
pleasing O
studies O
in O
the O
world O
, O
to O
comprehend O
the O

own O

with O
a O
wish O

render O
herself O
suitable O

them O
, O
as O
her O
mind O

constantly O
yielding O
her O

those O

loved O

this O
unobtrusive O
generosity O
was O
only O
a O
subject O
of O
satirical O
remark O
to O
her O

neither O

would O

Marion S-PERSON

on O

Agnes S-PERSON

On O
Caroline S-PERSON
leaving O
school O
, O
her O
aunt O
had O
taken O
a O
villa O
at O
Portobello S-FAC
, O
where O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
English S-LANGUAGE
strangers O
excited O
extreme O
attention O
, O
more O
from O
their O
evident O
desire O
to O
avoid O
it O
, O
than O
from O
any O
thing O
very O
remarkable O
in O
their O
appearance O
or O
manner O
, O
though O
Mrs. O
Smythe S-PERSON
was O
certainly O
of O
that O
genus O
old O
maid O
so O
common O
in O
England S-GPE
, O
with O
a O
handsome O
independence O
, O
a O
suite O
of O
servants O
, O
a O
pony O
- O
carriage O
, O
most O
splendid O
dress O
, O
and O
some O
pretensions O
still O
to O
youth O
and O
beauty O
, O
as O
any O
fragment O
of O
good O
looks O
that O
yet O
remained O
she O
most O
liberally O
displayed O

her O
manner O
had O
a O
flirting O
tone O
of O
coquetry O
most O
unsuitable O
to O
her O
apparent O
age O
, O
forming O
a O
singular O
contrast O
to O
the O
quaker O
- O
like O
simplicity O
of O
Caroline's O
dress O
. O
There O
was O
a O
singular O
contrast O
between O
the O
gravity O
of O
costume O
affected O
by O
Miss O
Smythe S-PERSON
, O
and O
the O
keen O
festivity O
of O
spirit O
with O
which O
she O
entered O
into O
every O
scheme O
of O
amusement O
, O
or O
even O
, O
it O
might O
be O
said O
, O
of O
mischief O
. O
Her O
vivacity O
was O
occasionally O
almost O
overpowering O
, O
her O
fancy O
lively O
beyond O
example O
, O
while O
with O
her O
brilliant O
, O
yet O
interesting O
animation O
, O
there O
was O
mingled O
a O
rare O
acuteness O
of O
mind O
, O
a O
swift O
comprehension O
, O
and O
an O
innate O
passion O
for O
all O
that O
was O
amiable O
and O
beautiful O
, O
which O
gave O
liveliness O
and O
vigor O
to O
what O
she O
said O
, O
though O
the O
rapidity O
of O
her O
mind O
sometimes O
led O
Caroline S-PERSON
to O
a O
false O
estimate O
of O
persons O
and O
circumstances O
, O
as O
she O
always O
judged O
or O
acted O
from O
instantaneous O
impulse O

yet O
there O
was O
a O
generous O
frankness O
in O
her O
disposition O
, O
which O
captivated O
those O
who O
knew O
her O
, O
and O
a O
graceful O
simplicity O
in O
all O
she O
did O
, O
which O
gave O
it O
interest O
| | O
for O
, O
without O
intention O
, O
there O
was O
something O
in O
all O
her O
thoughts O
and O
actions O
striking O
and O
peculiar O
. O
Her O
features O
, O
though O
irregular O
, O
attracted O
and O
enchained O
the O
eye O
, O
from O
the O
magical O
variety O
of O
their O
expression O
, O
and O
though O
an O
amateur O
of O
mere O
beauty O
might O
have O
been O
surprised O
and O
perplexed O
to O
divine O
why O
her O
light O
grey O
eyes O
, O
pale O
cheeks O
, O
and O
chestnut O
hair O
could O
beguile O
his O
attention O
away O
from O
the O
more O
perfect O
contour O
of O
others O
, O
the O
amateur O
of O
physiognomy O
was O
delighted O
to O
find O
there O
an O
ever O
- O
varying O
source O
of O
interest O
in O
watching O
the O
bright O
emanations O
of O
thought O
, O
feeling O
, O
and O
vivacity O
, O
which O
glittered O
or O
sparkled O
in O
her O
eye O
, O
or O
played O
about O
her O
mouth O
. O
When O
Mrs. O
Smythe S-PERSON
first O
settled O
at O
Portobello S-FAC
, O
scarcely O
a O
week O
of O
gossiping O
, O
wonder O
, O
and O
conjecture O
had O
elapsed O
, O
in O
the O
little O
community O
around O
, O
when O
she O
requested O
to O
have O
an O
interview O
with O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
alone O
, O
which O
took O
place O
immediately O
, O
and O
must O
have O
excited O
much O
interest O
in O
his O
mind O
, O
as O
the O
Admiral O
remained O
silent O
and O
abstracted O
during O
the O
whole O
subsequent O
evening O
, O

strolled O
slowly O
up O

down O
the O

pacing O
the O
quarter O

called O
it O

for O
a O
length O
of O
time O

, O
after O
being O
closeted O
some B-TIME
hours E-TIME
the B-DATE
following I-DATE
day E-DATE
with O
Mrs. O
Smythe S-PERSON
and O
his O
confidential O
agent O
, O
they O
proceeded O
to O
a O
magistrate's O
house O
together O
, O
with O
whom O
they O
requested O
a O
private O
conference O
, O
the O
purport O
of O
which O
did O
not O
transpire O
. O
From O
that O
day O
, O
an O
intimacy O
, O
amounting O
to O
friendship O
, O
was O
established O
between O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
and O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
ladies O

who O
seemed O
on O
all O
occasions O
to O
look O
to O
him O
for O
advice O
and O
protection O
, O
and O
in O
whose O
house O
they O
spent O
a O
part O

every O
day O

to O
the O
unspeakable O
delight O
of O
Henry B-PERSON

was O
charmed O

how O

seems O
the O
transition O
from O
boyhood O
to O
mature O
years O
! O
Henry S-PERSON
had O
early O
attained O
an O
extraordinary O
development O
of O
mind O
and O
appearance O
, O
a O
strength O
of O
intellect O
and O
a O
decision O
of O
purpose O
which O
seemed O
to O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
almost O
precocious O
, O
while O
every O
day O
discovered O
some O
new O
talent O
, O
or O
enlarged O

the O
Admiral O

when O
viewing O
the O
character O

his O
young O
protege O
, O
as O
it O
gradually O
arose O
to O
personal O
and O
intellectual O
supremacy O

His O
mind O
was O
ardent O
, O
courageous O

deeply O
contemplative O
, O
full O
of O

His O
mysterious O
history O

the O
fascination O
of O
his O
manner O

a O

With O
a O
strikingly O
handsome O
person O
, O
he O
had O
already O
acquired O
a O
decided O
air O
of O
fashion O

refinement O
, O
while O
a O
bright O
vein O
of O
almost O
chivalrous O
romance O

enlivened O

subdued O
by O

without O

his O

tinged O

Every O

Young O
as O
he O

however O
, O
Henry's S-PERSON
spirit O

solitary O

remember O

forbid O
him O

seek O
a O
mutual O
attachment O

his O
name O

station O
remained O
unknown O

and O
, O
perhaps O
, O
disgraceful O

There O
was O
a O
bewildering O
power O
in O
Caroline's S-NORP
society O

chained O
him O

bound O

unable O

her O
superior O

the O

the O
color O
of O
Caroline S-PERSON

Their O
extraordinary O
munificence O
to O
the O
poor O

astonished O
him O

that O
appeared O

all O

fermenting O

Mrs. O

exploded O
one B-DATE

there O
was O
so O
considerable O

tinge O
of O

that O
he O
became O
convinced O

must O
be O
Irish S-NORP

and O
she O
ended O
by O
singing O

out O

adopting O
the O

concluded O
with O
looking O
exultingly O
round O
in O
expectation O
of O
rapturous O
applause O
, O
which O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
bestowed O
in O
abundance O
, O
and O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
in O
comparative O
moderation O
, O
being O
, O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL

in O
his O

at O
a O

Repeated O

continued O
the O
intimacy O
which O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
had O
so O
oddly O
begun O
, O
and O
his O
curiosity O
became O
more O
and O
more O
piqued O
by O
the O
singularity O
of O
Miss O
Smythe's S-PERSON
manner O
and O
conversation O
. O
She O
displayed O
, O
along O
with O
a O
most O
extravagant O
love O
of O
amusement O
, O
a O
genius O
for O
satire O

mimicry O
quite O
unprecedented O
, O
and O
in O
which O
she O
most O
freely O
indulged O

Many O
a O
scene O
was O
acted O
over O
by O
her O

supported O
by O
Henry S-PERSON
, O
with O
astonishing O
talent O
and O
vivacity O

for O
both O
seemed O
to O
have O
a O
similar O

, O
being O
able O
, O
after O
an O
hour's O
intercourse O
with O
any O
individual O
, O
to O
imitate O
his O
whole O
peculiarities O
with O
almost O
magical O
precision O
— O
to O
follow O
, O
in O
an O
imaginary O
conversation O
, O
the O
very O
train O
of O
his O
ideas O

little O
trick O

habitual O

turn O
of O
the O
head O

every O
tone O
of O

with O
a O
gay O
look O
of O
mockery O
which O
would O
have O
made O
their O
fortunes O
on O
the O
stage O
. O
One B-TIME
evening E-TIME
, O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
having O
delivered O
up O
to O
his O
young O
friends O
the O
key O
of O
an O
old O
chest O
, O
filled O
with O
velvet O
coats O

worn O
by O

, O
Caroline S-PERSON

Henry S-PERSON

and O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
amused O
themselves O
by O
grouping O
some O
beautiful O
tableaux O
, O
and O
by O
acting O
charades O
. O
At O
one S-CARDINAL
time O
, O
both O
the O
gentlemen O
appeared O
in O
similar O
costumes O
, O
as O
Shakespeare's B-WORK_OF_ART

Dominos I-WORK_OF_ART

, O
when O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
suddenly O
exclaimed O
, O
as O
if O
he O
had O
made O
some O
great O
discovery O
, O
" O
How O
very O
strange O
that O
I O
never O
before O
observed O
the O
likeness O
between O
you O
two S-CARDINAL
good O
- O
looking O
young O
fellows O
! O
I O
declare O
it O
is O
quite O
remarkable O
! O
If O
you O
were O
brothers O
in O
reality O
as O
well O
as O
in O
pretence O
, O
it O
could O
scarcely O
be O
more O
striking O
! O
Do O
pray O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
, O
turn O
your O
profile O
more O
towards O
Mrs. O
Smythe S-PERSON
, O
that O
she O
may O
see O
what O
I O
mean O
! O
" O
Henry S-PERSON
laughingly O
received O
these O
remarks O
as O
an O
undoubted O
compliment O
, O
and O
bowed O
with O
good O
- O
humored O
grace O
to O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
who O
observed O
with O
astonishment O
that O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny's E-PERSON
color O
rushed O
to O
his O
very O
temples O
, O
and O
receded O
again O
, O
leaving O
his O
countenance O
pale O
and O
almost O
ghastly O
, O
while O
he O
suddenly O
broke O
off O
the O
entertainment O
, O
and O
strode O
up O
to O
the O
fire O
- O
place O
, O
where O
for O
some O
minutes O
he O
stood O
, O
with O
his O
back O
to O
the O
company O
, O
in O
evident O
agitation O
, O
while O
a O
dead O
silence O
ensued O
. O
" O
Well O
! O
" O
whispered O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
to O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
" O
I O
have O
often O
been O
told O
that O
people O
are O
never O
pleased O
with O
a O
likeness O
, O
but O
certainly O
Louis B-PERSON
De I-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
is O
the O
most O
conceited O
of O
men O
to O
feel O
so O
intolerably O
angry O
at O
being O
compared O
to O
my O
young O
friend O
here O

There O
are O
certainly O
worse O
- O
looking O
people O
in O
the O
world O
than O
Henry S-PERSON

" O
added O
the O
Admiral O
, O
with O
a O
look O
of O
partial O
affection O
. O
" O
And O
it O
was O
no O
such O
insult O
as O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
seems O
to O
think O
, O
when O
I O
paid O
him O
the O
compliment O
, O
to O
say O
that O
he O
resembled O
my O
boy O
, O
who O
is O
in O
every O
respect O
the O
pride O
of O
my O
heart O

" O
" O
I O
wish O
the O
Captain O
may O
never O
meet O
with O
a O
greater O
mortification O
, O
" O
replied O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
laughing O

" O
and O
I O
am O
sure O
he O
would O
be O
much O
the O
better O
of O
a O
few O
pretty O
severe O
ones O
to O
keep O
him O

" O
Henry S-PERSON

had O
observed O
with O
good O
- O
humored O
surprise O
, O
and O
no O
small O
degree O
of O
perplexity O

so O
disproportioned O
to O
the O

Captain O

had O
been O
thrown O
by O

with O
boyish O
frankness O
he O
instantly O
went O
up O

eye O
for O
which O
he O
could O
not O
account O
, O
though O
it O
made O
him O
feel O
somewhat O
uncomfortable O
and O
dissatisfied O
. O
If O
it O
were O
possible O
that O
any O
one O
could O
be O
laughing O
at O
him O
, O
she O
certainly O
was O
! O
A O
world O
of O
most O
intolerable O
ridicule O
appeared O
in O
her O
expression O
— O
an O
air O
almost O
of O
contempt O
! O
and O
he O
turned O
to O
leave O
the O
room O
with O
a O
feeling O
of O
mortification O
and O
anger O
which O
he O
was O
ashamed O
to O
allow O
even O
to O
himself O
. O
When O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
hurriedly O
opened O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
door O
, O
near O
which O
he O
and O
Caroline S-PERSON
had O
been O
standing O
, O
he O
was O
surprised O
to O
see O
a O
person O
lurking O
close O
behind O
it O
, O
who O
darted O
instantly O
away O
, O
and O
disappeared O
| | O
but O
before O
the O
intruder O
was O
out O
of O
sight O
, O
an O
exclamation O
of O
terror O
and O
dismay O
escaped O
from O
the O
lips O
of O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
who O
rushed O
towards O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
exclaiming O
, O
in O
accents O
of O
almost O
frantic O
alarm O
, O
" O
He O
is O
there O
! O
he O
is O
there O
! O
Oh O
! O
save O
me O
, O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
! O
he O
is O
there O
! O
That O
horrid O
, O
dreadful O
man O
! O
he O
is O
there O
! O
Stop O
him O
! O
stop O
him O
! O
" O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
instinctively O
ran O
in O
pursuit O
of O
the O
retreating O
figure O
, O
and O
eagerly O
attempted O
to O
seize O
him O
| | O
but O
the O
fugitive O
instantaneously O
opened O
the O
house O
door O
, O
and O
escaped O
in O
the O
darkness O
, O
while O
, O
apparently O
to O
intimidate O
his O
pursuer O
, O
he O
fired O
a O
pistol O
in O
the O
air O
, O
and O
waved O
another O
above O
his O
head O
with O
frantic O
gestures O
of O
rage O
and O
violence O
. O
" O
It O
is O
beyond O
all O
measure O
extraordinary O
how O
he O
got O
into O
the O
house O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
in O
discussing O
the O
event O
with O
an O
aspect O
of O
grave O
perplexity O
. O
" O
My O
doors O
are O
most O
systematically O
locked O
after O
dusk O
, O
and O
not O
a O
window O
is O
unbarred O
, O
yet O
the O
locks O
are O
unbroken O
and O
the O
bars O
untouched O
! O
" O
" O
There O
is O
something O
next O
to O
supernatural O
in O
the O
way O
he O
invariably O
finds O
us O
out O
, O
and O
gets O
access O
everywhere O
, O
" O
said O
Mrs. O
Smythe S-PERSON
, O
in O
almost O
breathless O
agitation O
. O
" O
One O
would O
imagine O
he O
had O
some O
unearthly O
accomplice O
to O
discover O
where O
we O
are O
concealed O
, O
and O
to O
assist O
him O
in O
escaping O
the O
vigilance O
of O
the O
police O
. O
Night O
and O
day O
we O
have O
been O
liable O
to O
his O
incursions O
. O
In O
town O
or O
country O
— O
in O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
, O
or O
beside O
our O
carriage O
— O
in O
church O
, O
or O
going O
to O
a O
party O
— O
there O
he O
is O
, O
lurking O
secretly O
near O
us O
, O
or O
terrifying O
Caroline S-PERSON
by O
his O
sudden O
disappearance O
, O
and O
gliding O
away O
like O
a O
shadow O
. O
He O
baffles O
every O
attempt O
to O
overtake O
or O
arrest O
him O
, O
but O
seems O
for O
ever O
on O
the O
watch O
! O
Sometimes O
he O
used O
to O
make O
his O
presence O
known O
by O
throwing O
a O
stone O
at O
our O
windows O
| | O
often O
at O
midnight O
, O
by O
singing O
hoarsely O
beneath O
them O
, O
and O
even O
occasionally O
by O
firing O
a O
pistol O
in O
the O
air O
| | O
but O
I O
did O
hope O
in O
this O
remote O
corner O
we O
might O
have O
enjoyed O
peace O
and O
safety O
. O
How O
are O
we O
ever O
to O
venture O
home O
? O
" O
" O
I O
shall O
escort O
you O
with O
the O
whole O
party O
in O
close O
phalanx O
, O
" O
replied O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
trying O
to O
assume O
a O
rallying O
tone O
. O
" O
Old O
Martin S-PERSON
and O
myself O
are O
quite O
invulnerable O
, O
and O
I O
only O
wish O
my O
secretary O
were O
here O
also O
, O
as O
he O
would O
be O
a O
host O
in O
himself O
| | O
but O
he O
is O
absent O
on O
a O
month's O
leave O
, O
and O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
in O
my O
life O
I O
miss O
him O
. O
" O
The O
night O
being O
impenetrably O
dark O
, O
and O
not O
a O
sound O
to O
be O
heard O
but O
the O
echo O
of O
their O
footsteps O
on O
the O
gravel O
, O
when O
Mrs. O
Smythe S-PERSON
alighted O
from O
the O
carriage O
to O
walk O
across O
the O
garden O
leading O
towards O
her O
house O
. O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
immediately O
desired O
the O
servants O
to O
bring O
out O
lights O
, O
when O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
candles O
having O
flared O
up O
suddenly O
near O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
she O
thought O
she O
perceived O
the O
madman O
close O
beside O
her O
, O
lurking O
behind O
the O
stem O
of O
a O
large O
tree O
. O
The O
dark O
shadows O
concealed O
all O
but O
his O
face O
, O
in O
which O
there O
gleamed O
a O
look O
of O
maniacal O
triumph O
and O
malignity O
, O
while O
rushing O
close O
up O
to O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
, O
he O
said O
, O
in O
a O
threatening O
tone O
, O
low O
and O
distinct O
, O
" O
He O
who O
crosses O
my O
path O
shall O
die O
! O
" O
and O
instantly O
disappeared O
through O
the O
hedge O
. O
When O
Miss O
Smythe S-PERSON
, O
on O
hearing O
his O
voice O
, O
with O
a O
stifled O
scream O
of O
terror O
fled O
into O
the O
house O
, O
again O
that O
loud O
and O
fiendish O
laugh O
, O
which O
she O
had O
already O
heard O
once O
, O
arose O
behind O
her O
, O
and O
rung O
through O
the O
night O
air O
in O
tones O
of O
high O
delirium O
, O
causing O
a O
cold O
shudder O
to O
thrill O
through O
the O
hearts O
of O
even O
the O
boldest O
among O
her O
companions O
, O
while O
they O
hastily O
followed O
her O
, O
and O
having O
placed O
the O
trembling O
girl O
in O
apparent O
safety O
, O
soon O
after O
took O
leave O
, O
charging O
the O
servants O
to O
chain O
and O
double O
- O
lock O
the O
door O
. O
It O
was O
some B-TIME
hours E-TIME
before O
Caroline S-PERSON
could O
sufficiently O
compose O
her O
mind O
to O
retire O
| | O
but O
after O
the O
house O
was O
sufficiently O
quiet O
, O
and O
the O
servants O
in O
bed O
, O
she O
sat O
up O
reading O
, O
with O
the O
hope O
that O
her O
nerves O
might O
become O
less O
painfully O
agitated O
. O
The O
slightest O
noise O
caused O
her O
heart O
to O
beat O
almost O
audibly O
, O
and O
she O
was O
conscious O
that O
a O
mouse O
rattling O
in O
the O
wainscot O
would O
have O
caused O
her O
to O
faint O
. O
Mrs. O
Smythe S-PERSON
could O
scarcely O
be O
prevailed O
upon O
to O
leave O
her O
alone O
| | O
but O
as O
they O
both O
slept O
on O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
floor O
, O
only O
divided O
by O
a O
thin O
partition O
, O
Caroline S-PERSON
induced O
her O
, O
at O
a B-TIME
late I-TIME
hour E-TIME
, O
to O
withdraw O
, O
while O
not O
a O
sound O
now O
disturbed O
the O
deep O
repose O
of O
nature O
, O
but O
" O
the O
wailing O
sorrows O
of O
some O
midnight O
bird O
. O
" O
The O
moon O
had O
arisen O
, O
shining O
with O
softened O
radiance O
into O
her O
apartment O
, O
when O
Miss O
Smythe S-PERSON
arose O
from O
her O
devotions O
, O
and O
she O
could O
not O
but O
think O
at O
the O
moment O
what O
a O
bright O
emblem O
of O
her O
divine O
Saviour O
that O
glorious O
luminary O
presented O
to O
the O
mind O
, O
not O
glowing O
, O
like O
the O
sun O
, O
with O
a O
radiance O
which O
no O
human O
eye O
can O
gaze O
upon O
, O
but O
reflecting O
upon O
the O
darkened O
earth O
a O
mild O
, O
subdued O
refulgence O
, O
perfectly O
suited O
for O
the O
steady O
contemplation O
of O
those O
whom O
it O
had O
arisen O
to O
benefit O
and O
cheer O
. O
Nature O
was O
hush'd O
, O
as O
if O
her O
works O
ador'd O
The O
night O
- O
felt O
presence O
of O
creation's O
Lord O
. O
Pleased O
with O
such O
thoughts O
, O
a O
gradual O
composure O
stole O
over O
her O
senses O
, O
and O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
at O
length O
, O
seeing O
her O
candle O
nearly O
burned O
out O
, O
consequently O
determined O
to O
retire O
for O
the O
night O
. O
Not O
a O
sound O
was O
to O
be O
heard O
in O
the O
house O
, O
but O
her O
own O
light O
step O
, O
as O
she O
moved O
about O
the O
room O
, O
— O
the O
very O
opening O
of O
a O
drawer O
, O
or O
the O
shutting O
of O
her O
book O
, O
sounded O
unnaturally O
loud O
, O
jarring O
upon O
her O
nerves O
with O
a O
startling O
effect O
, O
— O
the O
shadows O
in O
the O
more O
distant O
part O
of O
the O
room O
looked O
darker O
than O
usual O
, O
and O
the O
least O
moan O
of O
the O
wind O
increased O
the O
painful O
tension O
of O
her O
nerves O
to O
agony O
. O
Scarcely O
had O
she O
begun O
to O
undress O
, O
when O
a O
sudden O
noise O
not O
far O
off O
caused O
her O
to O
start O
with O
convulsive O
terror O
| | O
her O
heart O
became O
chilled O
with O
apprehension O
, O
the O
candlestick O
which O
she O
carried O
in O
her O
hand O
fell O
to O
the O
ground O
, O
the O
light O
was O
extinguished O
, O
and O
she O
stood O
trembling O
and O
alone O
in O
total O
, O
impenetrable O
darkness O
. O
Caroline S-PERSON
tried O
to O
persuade O
herself O
that O
the O
sound O
must O
have O
been O
produced O
by O
her O
own O
fancy O
, O
— O
she O
looked O
around O
, O
and O
all O
was O
quiet O
, O
— O
she O
listened O
, O
and O
all O
was O
perfectly O
still O
, O
— O
she O
reasoned O
with O
herself O
, O
and O
became O
resolute O
to O
try O
whether O
sleep O
might O
not O
plunge O
her O
into O
forgetfulness O
and O
peace O
, O
when O
her O
attention O
was O
accidentally O
attracted O
towards O
one O
of O
the O
windows O
, O
where O
the O
bright O
moonbeams O
rested O
on O
an O
object O
which O
seemed O
to O
blast O
her O
eyes O
with O
horror O
, O
and O
paralyzed O
her O
at O
once O
in O
a O
speechless O
agony O
of O
fear O
. O
The O
top O
of O
a O
ladder O
rested O
on O
the O
window O
- O
sill O
, O
upon O
the O
summit O
of O
which O
stood O
the O
dark O
figure O
of O
a O
man O
, O
his O
face O
plastered O
so O
close O
upon O
the O
glass O
, O
that O
his O
nose O
was O
perfectly O
flattened O
against O
it O
, O
and O
his O
hands O
raised O
in O
a O
menacing O
attitude O
towards O
her O
. O
The O
instant O
he O
saw O
, O
by O
Caroline's S-PERSON
look O
of O
frantic O
alarm O
, O
that O
she O
had O
seen O
him O
, O
he O
dashed O
in O
the O
window O
- O
frame O
by O
a O
single O
stroke O
of O
his O
powerful O
arm O
, O
and O
seemed O
about O
to O
make O
a O
forcible O
entrance O
, O
when O
Miss O
Smythe S-PERSON
, O
with O
the O
energy O
of O
despair O
, O
threw O
open O
the O
door O
, O
and O
fled O
, O
calling O
aloud O
, O
in O
the O
sharp O
, O
shrill O
accents O
of O
desperation O
, O
for O
help O
. O
The O
servants O
were O
speedily O
assembled O
around O
her O
, O
and O
the O
instant O
she O
felt O
herself O
in O
comparative O
safety O
, O
nature O
could O
sustain O
no O
more O
, O
but O
, O
convulsed O
in O
every O
nerve O
, O
and O
throwing O
herself O
into O
the O
arms O
of O
Mrs. O
Smythe S-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
cry O
of O
thankfulness O
and O
agitation O
, O
she O
fainted O
. O
An O
instant O
alarm O
was O
given O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
, O
a O
diligent O
search O
was O
made O
, O
and O
the O
police O
for O
several B-DATE
days E-DATE
exerted O
their O
utmost O
activity O
to O
detect O
the O
miscreant O
, O
but O
in O
vain O
. O
Not O
a O
trace O
remained O
to O
convince O
Caroline S-PERSON
that O
the O
whole O
had O
not O
been O
a O
hideous O
dream O
, O
except O
that O
the O
ladder O
had O
been O
left O
standing O
at O
her O
window O
, O

stolen O
from O
a O
neighboring O
garden O

The O
window O

frame O
exhibited O
a O
frightful O
picture O
of O
devastation O
, O
being O
literally O
broken O
to O
fragments O
, O
and O
at O
some O
distance O
in O
the O
garden O
a O
loaded O
pistol O
was O
discovered O
, O
perfectly O
new O
, O
which O
it O
was O
hoped O
might O
lead O
to O
a O
discovery O
, O
by O
the O
police O
tracing O
out O

CHAPTER O
VIII O
. O
Several O
meetings O
now O
took O
place O
at O
Sir O
Arthur's S-PERSON
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
considering O
what O
plans O
would O
be O
best O
adapted O
to O
secure O
the O
safety O
of O
Mrs. O
and O
Miss O
Smythe S-PERSON
, O
till O
the O
dangerous O
madman O
who O
persecuted O
them O
could O
be O
secured O
and O
confined O
, O
on O
all O
which O
occasions O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
attended O
, O
as O
he O
rather O
enjoyed O
the O
excitement O
and O
interest O
with O
which O
the O
story O
filled O
up O
his O
vacant O
hours O
, O
and O
, O
careless O
of O
the O
impression O
he O
believed O
himself O
to O
be O
making O
on O
the O
affections O
of O
Miss O
Smythe S-PERSON
, O
he O
felt O
some O
solicitude O
respecting O
her O
safety O
, O
while O
he O
expressed O
ten S-CARDINAL
times O
more O
than O
he O
felt O
, O
and O
observed O
, O
in O
his O
usual O
off O
- O
handed O
style O
, O
that O
this O
was O
not O
the O
only O
man O
whose O
head O
she O
would O
probably O
turn O
| | O
but O
in O
his O
own O
case O
, O
though O
she O
had O
almost O
put O
him O
out O
of O
his O
senses O
already O
, O
yet O
he O
would O
rather O
make O
an O
end O
of O
himself O
than O
of O
her O
. O
Caroline S-PERSON
drily O
thanked O
him O
for O
his O
obliging O
intentions O
on O
her O
behalf O
, O
and O
after O
a O
lively O
dialogue O
, O
in O
which O
the O
gay O
huzzar O
actually O
excelled O
himself O
, O
in O
his O
fervent O
expressions O
of O
admiration O
and O
regard O
, O
he O
took O
leave O
, O
rather O
wondering O
to O
think O
how O
he O
had O
been O
led O
on O
in O
professing O
so O
much O
, O
and O
giving O
himself O
a O
lecture O
as O
he O
rode O
home O
, O
on O
the O
propriety O
of O
beginning O
to O
" O
back O
out O
, O
" O
seeing O
that O
he O
was O
getting O
rather O
beyond O
his O
depth O
. O
Still O
there O
were O
several O
of O
the O
reasons O
for O
meeting O
next B-DATE
day E-DATE
, O
usual O
with O
those O
who O
have O
a O
natural O
desire O
to O
improve O
an O
agreeable O
intimacy O
, O
a O
song O
to O
be O
practised O
, O
a O
drawing O
to O
be O
admired O
| | O
and O
Miss O
Smythe S-PERSON
having O
made O
a O
sort O
of O
promise O
to O
let O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
sit O
to O
her O
for O
his O
picture O
in O
the O
character O
of O
Dromio S-PERSON
, O
as O
she O
was O
an O
admirable O
artist O
, O
the O
offer O
became O
irresistible O
. O
He O
had O
never O
yet O
entered O
their O
own O
house O
, O
as O
meetings O
were O
always O
hitherto O
arranged O
at O
Sir O
Arthur's S-PERSON
| | O
and O
a O
slight O
feeling O
of O
curiosity O
likewise O
helped O
him O
to O
the O
agreeable O
conclusion O
, O
that O
he O
must O
for O
once O
, O
and O
only O
once O
, O
call O
on O
the O
" O
Smythes S-PERSON
, O
" O
were O
it O
only O
to O
ascertain O
what O
sort O
of O
establishment O
they O
had O
. O
Punctual O
to O
the O
appointed O
hour O
, O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny's E-PERSON
groom O
rang O
a O
consequential O
peal O
for O
his O
master O
at O
the O
gate O
of O
Rosemount B-FAC
Villa E-FAC
, O
such O
as O
had O
not O
been O
heard O
there O
since O
bells O
were O
invented O
, O
and O
after O
a O
considerable O
delay O
, O
the O
door O
was O
opened O
by O
a O
shabby O
awkward O
- O
looking O
Irish S-NORP
girl O
, O
speaking O
with O
a O
powerful O
brogue O
, O
who O
curtsied O
with O
an O
appearance O
of O
most O
preposterous O
respect O
to O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
as O
he O
alighted O
, O
and O
pointed O
up O
stairs O
, O
begging O
him O
to O
walk O
in O
, O
but O
without O
having O
an O
idea O
apparently O
that O
she O
ought O
herself O
to O
usher O
him O
into O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
. O
Being O
always O
pretty O
confident O
of O
making O
himself O
welcome O
, O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
advanced O
, O
and O
in O
his O
usual O
gay O
, O
humorous O
tone O
, O
announced O
his O
own O
name O
at O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
door O
, O
while O
he O
threw O
it O
open O
and O
entered O
. O
To O
his O
surprise O
, O
he O
now O
found O
himself O
in O
a O
small O
, O
not O
very O
splendidly O
furnished O
apartment O
, O
stretched O
on O
the O
only O
sofa O
belonging O
to O
which O
, O
there O
lounged O
, O
in O
solitary O
indolence O
, O
with O
a O
quite O
- O
at O
- O
home O
look O
, O
a O
young O
man O
whom O
he O
had O
never O
seen O
before O
. O
His O
aspect O
and O
dress O
were O
equally O
singular O
, O
presenting O
that O
happy O
mixture O
of O
the O
ruffian O
and O
gentleman O
, O
not O
very O
uncommon O
in O
Ireland S-GPE
. O
Attired O
in O
a O
military O
great O
- O
coat O
, O
he O
wore O
a O
most O
preposterous O
pair O
of O
whiskers O
and O
mustachios O
, O
long O
, O
coarse O
, O
and O
dirty O
, O
which O
looked O
as O
if O
they O
had O
been O
curled O
over O
knitting O
wires O
. O
Taking O
the O
last O
remnant O
of O
a O
cigar O
out O
of O
his O
mouth O
when O
the O
visitor O
entered O
, O
and O
showing O
not O
the O
smallest O
surprise O
, O
with O
a O
smile O
which O
betrayed O
a O
set O
of O
dingy O
, O
decayed O
teeth O
, O
and O
a O
very O
disfiguring O
squint O
, O
he O
watched O
the O
approaching O
step O
of O
Captain O

A O

curled O

up O

down O
the O

with O
rapid O
strides O

determined O
emphasis O
. O
At O
length O
, O
stopping O
opposite O
to O
his O
irritated O
companion O
, O
he O
eyed O
him O
for O
some O
moments O
with O
a O
look O
of O
stern O
reproach O
, O
saying O
, O
in O
a O
stronger O
Irish S-NORP
brogue O
than O
ever O
, O
and O
with O
a O
torrent O
of O
indignation O
, O
which O
gave O
almost O
the O
dignity O
of O
eloquence O
to O
what O
he O
uttered O
, O
" O

think O
there O
are O
no O
feelings O

your O
own O

we O
may O
prove O
this O
a O
slight O
mistake O

married O
seven S-CARDINAL

Captain O
Mortimer S-PERSON

introduced O
to O
Mary S-PERSON
at O
the O
top O
of O
a O
country O

engaged O
her O
for O
life O

reached O
the O
bottom O

gave O
his O
arm O

offered O
her O
his O
hand O

off O

understand O
these O

very O
soon O
in O

would O
shed O
every O

shall O
be O
disappointed O

" O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
began O
now O
to O
feel O
seriously O
annoyed O
at O
his O
own O
position O
! O
Not O
having O
lately O
been O
quartered O
in O
Ireland S-GPE
, O
he O
had O
forgotten O
how O
such O
affairs O
are O
managed O
there O
, O
but O
at O
this O
moment O
a O
thousand S-CARDINAL
recollections O
crowded O
upon O
him O
, O
of O
warnings O
he O
had O
received O
from O
his O
brother O
officers O
respecting O
the O
prudence O
and O
circumspection O
to O
be O
exercised O
beside O
the O
Shannon S-PERSON
, O
though O
most O
of O
what O
they O
said O
, O
had O
been O
listened O
to O
with O
the O
same O
incredulous O
attention O
usually O
bestowed O
upon O
stories O
of O
ghosts O
and O
witchcraft O
. O
Here O
he O
was O
, O
however O
, O
snared O
like O
a O
fly O
in O
a O
spider's O
web O
, O
though O
without O
a O
single O
doubt O
of O
his O
own O
powers O
to O
escape O
, O
and O
with O
no O
stronger O
objection O
to O
call O
out O
this O
insolent O
ruffian O
beside O
him O
, O
than O
the O
publicity O

ridicule O

must O
inevitably O
incur O
, O
if O
involved O
in O
a O
vulgar O
every O

day O
duel O

a O
hot O

headed O
Irishman S-NORP

Seeing O
that O
the O
affair O
was O
likely O
to O
take O
a O
graver O
turn O

he O
had O
imagined O

Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
now O
slowly O

resolutely O
strode O
towards O
the O
hearth O

rug O
, O
and O
turning O
his O
back O
to O
the O
fire O
, O
in O
that O
attitude O
peculiar O
to O
Englishmen S-NORP
, O
calmly O
and O
sternly O
looked O
in O
the O
face O
of O
his O
insolent O
companion O
, O
whose O
lip O
became O
compressed O
with O
an O
air O
of O
fierce O
determination O
, O
while O
his O
dark O
eye O
glittered O
with O
a O
triumphant O
smile O
, O
and O
in O
an O
attitude O
of O
perfect O
nonchalance O
, O
he O
returned O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
gaze O

gaze O

while O
leisurely O
resuming O
his O
lounging O
attitude O
on O
the O
sofa O
. O
Neither O
gentleman O
seemed O
at O
all O
inclined O
to O
recommence O
the O
discussion O
immediately O
, O
and O
both O
looked O
equally O
angry O
, O
till O
the O
Irishman S-NORP
at O
length O
opened O
a O
pocket O
- O
book O
, O
to O
which O
, O
he O
frequently O
afterwards O
referred O

with O
a O
business O
- O
like O
air O
, O
and O
in O
a O
tone O
of O
conscious O
triumph O
, O
saying O
, O
" O

almost O
delirious O
with O
rage O

drawing O
in O
his O
breath O
between O
his O
clenched O

while O
the O
Irishman S-NORP
eyed O
him O
with O
provoking O
coolness O

merely O
muttered O
in O
reply O

while O
still O
referring O
to O
the O
pocket O

almost O
beside O
himself O

away O

come O
over O

He O
could O
not O

mistaken O

seemed O
even O
as O
if O
there O
were O
female O
voices O
in O
the O
number O

but O
almost O
bewildered O
with O
anger O
, O
and O
happy O
also O
to O
escape O
, O
he O
hastened O
onwards O
, O
threw O
himself O
on O
horseback O
, O
and O
galloped O
for O
three B-TIME
hours E-TIME
before O
he O
had O
regained O
any O
portion O
of O
his O
usual O
equanimity O
. O
Had O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
followed O
his O
first S-ORDINAL
impulse O
, O
on O
hearing O
the O
laughter O
behind O
him O
, O
it O
would O
have O
been O
to O
retrace O
his O
steps O
and O
re-enter O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
of O
Mrs. O
Smythe S-PERSON
, O
when O
his O
astonishment O
would O
certainly O
not O
have O
been O
small O
to O
see O
Henry B-PERSON
De I-PERSON
Lancey E-PERSON
laughingly O
disencumbering O
himself O
of O
his O
whiskers O
, O
wig O
, O
and O
mustachios O
, O
while O
Mrs. O
Smith S-PERSON
exclaimed O
, O
in O
accents O
of O
almost O
convulsive O
risibility O
, O
" O
Well O
done O
, O
my O
adopted O
nephew O
! O
You O
deserve O
to O
be O
my O
heir O
! O
I O
have O
often O
heard O
that O
my O
old O
aversion O
Louis B-PERSON
De I-PERSON
Crespigny's E-PERSON
exploits O
were O
inimitable O
in O
his O
line O
| | O
but O
we O
needed O
such O
a O
specimen O
as O
this O
. O
I O
bestow O
the O
fright O
upon O
him O
with O
all O
the O
pleasure O
in O
life O
! O
" O
" O
I O
only O
hope O
, O
if O
we O
ever O
, O
in O
the O
course O
of O
years O
, O
meet O
again O
, O
that O
my O
cousin O
will O
not O
recognise O
me O
, O
" O
added O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
smiling O
. O
" O
It O
was O
not O
particularly O
flattering O
to O
see O
Louis S-PERSON
in O
so O
much O
alarm O
! O
Yesterday S-DATE
, O
however O
, O
when O
he O
saw O
me O
last O
, O
I O
was O
certainly O
looking O
my O
very O
worst O
. O
" O
" O
Your O
worst O
is O
better O
than O
the O
best O
of O
anybody O
else O
, O
" O
exclaimed O
Henry S-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
tone O
so O
exactly O
resembling O
that O
of O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
, O
that O
Mrs. O
Smythe S-PERSON
started O
, O
and O
looked O
round O
with O
alarm O
| | O
while O
Caroline S-PERSON
and O
young O
De B-PERSON
Lancey E-PERSON
burst O
into O
a O
simultaneous O
laugh O
of O
frolicsome O
glee O
, O
and O
continued O
the O
dialogue O
during O
several B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
, O
with O
great O
spirit O
and O
vivacity O
, O
till O
Henry S-PERSON
suddenly O
became O
conscious O
, O
that O
in O
imagining O
the O
words O
of O
another O
, O
he O
was O
gradually O
betrayed O
into O
expressing O
his O
own O
real O
feelings O
, O
and O
that O
, O
too O
, O
with O
a O
depth O
and O
fervor O
which O
sincerity O
alone O
could O
have O
dictated O
. O
Checking O
himself O
in O
a O
moment O
, O
while O
the O
color O
rushed O
to O
his O
face O
, O
dyeing O
it O
red O
to O
the O
very O
roots O
of O
his O
hair O
, O
and O
instantly O
receded O
again O
, O
he O
took O
a O
hurried O
leave O
of O
Mrs. O
Smythe S-PERSON
, O
and O
turning O
to O
Caroline S-PERSON
with O
a O
quivering O
lip O
, O
he O
said O
, O
in O
a O
voice O
which O
none O
but O
herself O
could O
hear O
, O
" O
I O
must O
not O
say O
in O
jest O
what O
I O
feel O
in O
earnest O
! O
Farewell O
! O
There O
are O
wishes O
known O
only O
to O
my O
own O
heart O
, O
and O
never O
to O
be O
realized O
, O
which O
I O
must O
try O
to O
forget O
. O
You O
go O
to O
- O
morrow O
, O
and O
we O
shall O
probably O
meet O
no O
more O
! O
Forgive O
me O
, O
then O
, O
if O
I O
say O
, O
that O
so O
long O
as O
I O
live O
you O
shall O
be O
first S-ORDINAL
in O
my O
most O
respectful O
and O
devoted O
affections O

and O
death O
only O
can O
ever O
make O
me O
forget O
you O
. O
" O
Before O
Henry S-PERSON
left O
the O
ante-room O
, O
being O
in O
search O
of O
his O
hat O
, O
he O
found O
it O
laid O
beside O
an O
open O
portfolio O
on O
the O
table O
, O
which O
, O
having O
, O
in O
his O
haste O
, O
accidentally O
thrown O
down O
, O
he O
began O
hastily O
collecting O
its O
contents O
, O
when O
his O
surprise O
was O
great O
, O
on O
turning O
up O
one S-CARDINAL
sheet O
of O
the O
drawing O
paper O
, O
to O
find O
there O
a O
finely O
- O
executed O
sketch O
, O
done O
with O
all O
the O
skill O
and O
spirit O
of O
an O
accomplished O
artist O
, O
representing O
the O
venerable O
head O
of O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
| | O
and O
on O
the O
same O
paper O
— O
could O
it O
be O
possible O
! O
— O
an O
almost O
living O
representation O
of O
himself O
. O
The O
likeness O
very O
much O
flattered O
, O
he O
thought O
— O
exceedingly O
flattered O
| | O
but O
still O
it O
could O
be O
no O
other O
| | O
and O
the O
picture O
dropped O
from O
his O
hand O
in O
the O
transport O
of O
his O
delight O
. O
Henry S-PERSON
again O
returned O
to O
the O
portfolio O
, O
hurriedly O
turning O
the O
leaves O
over O
| | O
and O
amidst O
a O
variety O
of O
superbly O
- O
finished O
miniatures O
, O
he O
found O
his O
own O
countenance O
over O
and O
over O
again O
grouped O
in O
animated O
contrast O
with O
that O
of O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
. O
His O
heart O
throbbed O
with O
joy O
, O
when O
, O
after O
hastily O
turning O
to O
the O
title O
- O
page O
, O
he O
discovered O
, O
according O
to O
his O
hopes O
and O
wishes O
, O
the O
name O
of O
Caroline B-PERSON
Smythe E-PERSON
| | O
and O
he O
leaned O
his O
head O
on O
his O
hand O
, O
contemplating O
that O
name O
in O
silent O
ecstacy O
, O
while O
indulging O
for O
one O
moment O
the O
pleasing O
, O
but O
perhaps O
presumptuous O
hope O
, O
that O
he O
had O
been O
remembered O
with O
unacknowledged O
partiality O
, O
and O
that O
the O
secret O
was O
here O
portrayed O
with O
her O
own O
pencil O
. O
He O
was O
about O
then O
to O
withdraw O
, O
when O
suddenly O
the O
raised O
and O
irritated O
tones O
of O
Mrs. O
Smythe S-PERSON
became O
unavoidably O
audible O
to O
him O
, O
from O
the O
room O
he O
had O
so O
recently O
left O
, O
saying O
, O
in O
accents O
of O
angry O
remonstrance O
, O
" O
That O
look O
of O
girlish O
joy O
when O
he O
comes O
, O
and O
the O
sadness O
of O
your O
eye O
when O
he O
departs O
, O
might O
betray O
it O
to O
any O
one O
less O
interested O
than O
myself O
| | O
but O
he O
has O
met O
few O
ladies O
hitherto O
, O
and O
on O
his O
part O
it O
is O
a O
mere O
boyish O
fancy O
, O
which O
, O
if O
properly O
discouraged O
, O
will O
of O
itself O
wear O
out O
. O
" O
Henry S-PERSON
had O
fled O
to O
avoid O
hearing O
what O
was O
not O
intended O
for O
him O
, O
before O
Caroline S-PERSON
replied O
, O
in O
a O
low O
, O
agitated O
voice O
, O
" O
I O
think O
and O
hope O
you O
are O
mistaken O

his O
constancy O

disinterestedness O
shall O
be O
tried O

proved O

a O
tone O

tremulous O

CHAPTER O
IX O
. O
Among O
the O
companions O
of O
Agnes S-PERSON
and O
Marion B-PERSON
Dunbar E-PERSON
, O
none O
was O
more O
calculated O
to O
excite O
a O
feeling O
of O
enthusiastic O
tenderness O
and O
regard O
than O
Clara B-PERSON
Granville E-PERSON
, O
whom O
all O
approached O
with O
a O
feeling O
of O
nearly O
romantic O
interest O
, O
occasioned O
by O
the O
etherealized O
delicacy O
of O
her O
lovely O
countenance O
and O
fragile O
form O
. O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
, O
from O
her O
earliest O
childhood O
, O
had O
always O
mentioned O
Clara S-PERSON
in O
terms O
of O
such O
exaggerated O
enthusiasm O
, O
that O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
imagining O
his O
taste O
to O
be O
very O
different O
, O
believed O
him O
to O
be O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
half E-CARDINAL
in O
jest O
, O
though O
his O
language O
and O
manner O
seemed O
daily O
to O
become O
more O
in O
earnest O
, O
while O
in O
terms O
of O
rapture O
he O
admired O
her O
eloquent O
and O
intelligent O
conversation O
, O
so O
different O
from O
the O
flippant O
nonsense O
of O
most O
girls O
, O
and O
the O
light O
gracefulness O
of O
her O
step O
, O
saying O
she O
looked O
like O
some O
beautiful O
apparition O
, O
less O
encumbered O
with O
body O
, O
and O
more O
endowed O
with O
spirit O
, O
than O
any O
one O
who O
ever O
before O
stepped O
upon O
the O
earth O
. O
Her O
pale O
golden O
hair O
, O
falling O
like O
a O
halo O
round O
her O
fair O
bright O
countenance O
, O
and O
the O
rare O
beauty O
of O
her O
large O
downcast O
eyes O
, O
which O
were O
generally O
veiled O
with O
a O
look O
of O
deep O
thought O
and O
sensibility O
, O
gave O
a O
charm O
so O
peculiar O
to O
her O
aspect O
, O
that O
the O
eye O
loved O
to O
dwell O
upon O
it O
as O
upon O
some O
lovely O
twilight O
scene O
, O
over O
which O
the O
light O
of O
heaven O
was O
casting O
its O
pure O
and O
peaceful O
, O
yet O
fading O
refulgence O
. O
None O
looked O
at O
Clara S-PERSON

fearing O
that O
she O
could O
not O
be O
long O
intended O
for O
this O
world O
, O
as O
the O
fervor O
of O
her O
mind O
and O
feelings O
appeared O
so O
little O
in O
proportion O
to O
the O
extreme O
delicacy O
of O
her O
complexion O
, O
which O
was O
tinted O
like O
a O
rose O
- O
leaf O
on O
her O
transparent O
cheek O
, O
the O
color O
flitting O
with O
every O
passing O
emotion O
. O
It O
did O
indeed O
seem O
as O
if O
the O
sword O
within O
must O
quickly O
wear O
out O
the O
scabbard O

yet O
Clara S-PERSON
enjoyed O
society O
beyond O
measure O
, O

mingled O
in O
it O
with O
a O
zest O
which O
caused O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
often O
to O
say O
she O
must O
be O
stronger O
certainly O
than O
she O
looked O
, O
and O
there O
was O
nothing O
, O
he O
thought O
, O
more O
odious O
in O
a O
woman O
than O
rude O
health O
— O
a O
sort O
of O
rudeness O
never O
certainly O
attributable O
to O
Miss O
Granville S-PERSON
. O
Agnes's S-PERSON
favorite O
aversion O
had O
always O
been O
Clara S-PERSON
, O
formerly O
her O
cotemporary O
and O
rival O
at O
school O
, O
though O
the O
rivalship O
was O
only O
felt O
on O
one S-CARDINAL
side O
, O
as O
Miss O
Granville S-PERSON
would O
have O
remained O
unconscious O
of O
its O
very O
existence O
, O
but O
for O
the O
bitter O
taunts O
occasionally O
levelled O
at O
her O
, O
and O
the O
tone O
of O
evident O
irritability O
in O
which O
Agnes S-PERSON
took O
it O
always O
for O
granted O
that O
the O
jealousy O
was O
mutual O
, O
attributing O
thoughts O
and O
motives O
perpetually O
to O
her O
gentle O
companion O
, O
of O
which O
so O
amiable O
and O
well O
- O
regulated O
a O
disposition O
was O
incapable O
. O
It O
may O
generally O
be O
observed O
, O
that O
many O
more O
quarrels O
arise O
from O
people O
wilfully O
taking O
offence O
, O
than O
from O
people O
wilfully O
giving O
it O
| | O
and O
there O
is O
quite O
as O
much O
ill O
- O
temper O
in O
the O
one S-CARDINAL
case O
as O
in O
the O
other O
. O
Clara S-PERSON
had O
suffered O
much O
on O
account O
of O
her O
every O
inadvertent O
word O
or O
action O
being O
purposely O
misconstrued O
| | O
but O
she O
very O
properly O
viewed O
the O
annoyance O
as O
a O
salutary O
lesson O
in O
circumspection O
, O
before O
entering O
the O
great O
arena O
of O
society O
, O
and O
mildly O
avoided O
all O
collision O
of O
interests O
or O
opinions O
with O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
though O
her O
whole O
powers O
of O
conciliation O
on O
the O
part O
of O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
gave O
his O
sister O
reason O
to O
apprehend O
that O
his O
affections O
might O
by O
possibility O
be O
engaged O
to O
her O
. O
Nothing O
could O
be O
more O
painfully O
irritating O
than O
the O
tone O
of O
contempt O
with O
which O
Agnes S-PERSON
" O
spoke O
at O
" O
Clara S-PERSON
respecting O
the O
art O
and O
cunning O
with O
which O
some O
manœuvring O
misses O
endeavored O
to O
push O
their O
fortune O
in O
the O
matrimonial O
world O
, O
by O
making O
advances O
to O
gentlemen O
, O
which O
she O
would O
despise O
herself O
for O
condescending O
to O
, O
and O
that O
lookers O
on O
see O
more O
of O
the O
game O
than O
is O
intended O
. O
All O
this O
was O
said O
in O
such O
an O
accidental O
tone O
, O
and O
in O
such O
general O
terms O
, O
that O
no O
decided O
notice O
could O
be O
taken O
of O
it O
by O
Clara S-PERSON
, O
who O
nevertheless O
felt O
so O
painful O
a O
consciousness O
of O
what O
was O
meant O
and O
insinuated O
, O
that O
she O
ceased O
almost O
entirely O
to O
visit O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
or O
to O
associate O
with O
her O
. O
About O
the O
time O
when O
Mrs. O
Smythe S-PERSON
left O
Portobello S-GPE
, O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
returned O
from O
spending O
a O
month O
at O
Lady B-FAC
Towercliffe's E-FAC
in O
Fife S-GPE
, O
evidently O
laboring O
under O
a O
depression O
of O
spirits O
very O
unusual O
with O
him O
| | O
and O
when O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
perplexed O
by O
observing O
that O
he O
did O
not O
attempt O
to O
throw O
off O
the O
cloud O
of O
melancholy O
, O
tinged O
very O
strongly O
with O
ill O
- O
humor O
, O
which O
had O
so O
suddenly O
come O
over O
him O
, O
tried O
to O
guess O
or O
discover O
the O
cause O
, O
she O
found O
it O
for O
some O
time O
impossible O
to O
gain O
a O
glimpse O
of O
the O
truth O
, O
though O
she O
asked O
as O
many O
questions O
as O
might O
have O
filled O
a O
volume O
of O
Pinnock's O
Catechisms O
. O
At O
length O
, O
after O
some O
miscellaneous O
conversation O
one B-DATE
day E-DATE
, O
Agnes S-PERSON
inquired O
for O
the O
twentieth S-ORDINAL
time O
whether O
the O
party O
in O
Fife S-GPE
had O
been O
agreeable O
, O
when O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
shortly O
and O
drily O
replied O
, O
" O
Clara B-PERSON
Granville E-PERSON
was O
there O
! O
" O
" O
But O
had O
you O
any O
new O
beauties O
? O
" O
" O
Clara B-PERSON
Granville E-PERSON
! O
" O
" O
Pshaw O
! O
Well O
, O
then O
! O
were O
there O
any O
agreeable O
people O
? O
" O
" O
Clara B-PERSON
Granville E-PERSON
! O
" O
" O
You O
are O
beyond O
all O
bearing O
absurd O
and O
tormenting O
, O
Pat S-PERSON
! O
" O
continued O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
contemptuous O
toss O
of O
her O
head O
| | O
" O
but O
I O
may O
at O
least O
venture O
with O
impunity O
to O
ask O
, O
were O
any O
of O
the O
ladies O
well O
dressed O
? O
" O
" O
Clara B-PERSON
Granville E-PERSON
! O
" O
" O
That O
ends O
my O
curiosity O
on O
the O
subject O
of O
your O
visit O
, O
" O
replied O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
angrily O
affecting O
to O
yawn O
. O
" O
Never O
try O
to O
persuade O
me O
you O
care O
for O
Clara S-PERSON
. O
She O
is O
the O
most O
unflirtable O
girl O
in O
the O
world O
! O
As O
cold O
as O
a O
statue O
of O
ice O
in O
an O
east O
wind O
! O
She O
has O
the O
most O
tiresome O
style O
of O
prettiness O
that O
can O
be O
conceived O
, O
with O
that O
alabaster O
paleness O
, O
that O
petrifying O
calmness O
of O
manner O
, O
and O
a O
heart O
like O
a O
cucumber O
! O
The O
very O
style O
of O
her O
dress O
is O
wearying O
, O
with O
not O
a O
color O
that O
one O
could O
give O
a O
name O
to O

and O
then O
her O
long O
undertoned O
tete O
- O
a- O
tete O
conversations O
about O
nobody O
knows O
what O
, O
as O
dull O
and O
monotonous O
as O
a O
dinner O
- O
bell O
, O
never O
enlivened O
with O
a O
bit O
of O
gossip O
, O
nor O
spiced O
with O
any O
scandal O
! O
There O
is O
a O
whole O
" O
Society O
for O
the O
suppression O
of O

" O
in O
her O
eye O
every O
time O
she O
looks O
at O
one O
! O
She O
would O
evidently O
be O
terrified O
for O
the O
echo O
of O
her O
own O
voice O
, O
and O
never O
yet O
committed O
the O
indiscretion O
of O
a O
laugh O
! O
" O
" O
Are O
you O
done O
? O
" O
asked O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
tone O
of O
concentrated O
anger O
, O
which O
would O
have O
silenced O
any O
one O
but O
Agnes S-PERSON
. O
" O
Done O
! O
I O
could O
speak O
for O
two B-TIME
hours E-TIME
without O
telling O
you O
half O
how O
little O
I O
think O
of O
Clara B-PERSON

" O
said O
she O
, O
in O
a O
paroxysm O
of O
eloquence O
. O
" O
One S-CARDINAL
comfort O
is O
, O
however O
, O
she O
will O
never O
take O
! O
" O
" O
But O
Clara S-PERSON

already O
' O
taken O
, O
' O
as O
you O
elegantly O
express O
yourself O
, O
" O
exclaimed O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
been O
walking O
vehemently O
up O
and O
down O
the O
room O
during O
this O
tirade O
from O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
and O
now O
stood O
opposite O
to O
her O
, O
with O
a O
look O
of O
angry O
defiance O
. O
" O
Clara S-PERSON
is O
surpassingly O
lovely O
! O
Her O
portrait O

the O
loveliness O
of O

seraph O
! O
" O
" O
Certainly O
, O
if O
you O
mean O
that O
she O
looks O
as O
if O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
breath O
of O
wind O
would O
blow O
her O
down O
! O
like O
an O
overgrown O
geranium O
, O
that O
should O
be O
tied O
up O
to O
a O
stick O
! O
" O
" O
Clara S-PERSON
is O
delicate O
and O
graceful O
as O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
frail O
blossoms O
of O
spring O
, O
" O
interrupted O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
. O
" O
She O
has O
but O
one S-CARDINAL
fault O
in O
the O
world O
, O
and O
that O
is O
, O
being O
faultless O
! O
Clara S-PERSON

worth O

whole O
creation O
of O
ordinary O
girls O

as O
serene O
as O
the O
blue O

Her O
every O
attitude O
is O
what O
a O
Guido S-PERSON
might O
have O
delighted O
to O
paint O
. O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
there O
is O
music O
and O
rapture O
in O
every O
tone O
of O
her O
voice O

At O
Lady B-PERSON
Towercliffe's E-PERSON
no O

Miss O

any O
man O
guessing O
his O
danger O

Sir O

up O

month O

house O

replied O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
voice O
which O
sounded O
by O
no O
means O
like O
jest O

" O
and O
that O
month O
was O
more O
than O
a O
lifetime O
in O
showing O
me O
the O
worth O

attachment O

Even O
I O

the O
beginning O

my O
existence O

the O
hour O

first S-ORDINAL
knew O
her O

There O
is O
a O
depth O
of O
mind O

heart O

the O
character O
of O
Clara B-PERSON

utterly O
incomprehensible O

She O

everything O

says O
everything O
with O
a O
grace O

her O

Her O
manner O
is O
the O
very O
essence O

fascination O

Every O
other O
person O
seems O
coarse O

vulgar O
in O
comparison O

I O
even O
feel O
so O
myself O

cannonade O

Sir O

not O

his O
eagerness O

opposition O

adopted O
invisibility O

evening O

send O
the O
very O
kindest O
notes O

the O
polite O
apology O

Sir O

rapid O

that O
very O

a O
very O
decided O
view O

the O
subject O

Though O
Sir O

had O
long O
been O
known O
as O
a O
Tattersall S-PERSON

Doncaster S-GPE
man O
, O
yet O
Clara B-PERSON
Granville E-PERSON
had O
little O
suspected O
that O
his O
name O
was O
implicated O
in O
transactions O
of O
rather O
an O
equivocal O
complection O
, O
while O
the O
good O
- O
natured O
half O
of O
the O
world O
persevered O
in O
calling O
it O
scandal O
, O
being O
unwilling O
very O
severely O
to O
censure O
the O
peccadilloes O
of O
the O
handsomest O
and O
most O
agreeable O
man O
in O
their O
circle O
of O
society O
, O
living O
only O
for O
the O
enjoyment O
of O
the O
senses O
and O
the O
happiness O
of O
the O
present O
hour O
, O
while O
he O
thought O
it O
too O
long O
a O
look O

out O
to O
anticipate O
what O
might O
happen O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
after I-DATE

. O
In O
respect O
to O
Sir O
Patrick's S-PERSON
reputation O
, O
a O
vague O
understanding O
seemed O
to O
prevail O
that O
all O
was O
not O
right O
, O
yet O
no O
explicit O
explanation O
seemed O
ever O
to O
be O
obtained O
. O
Some O
thing O
there O
was O
— O
what O
, O
none O
presumed O
to O
say O
, O
Clouds O
lightly O
passing O
as O
the O
summer O
day O
. O
There O
are O
not O
only O
faults O
in O
the O
very O
best O
characters O
, O
but O
redeeming O
qualities O
also O
in O
the O
very O
worst O
, O
and O
with O
much O
selfishness O
, O
the O
result O
of O
a O
perverted O
education O
, O
the O
handsome O
and O
fascinating O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
had O
naturally O
a O
good O
temper O
and O
excitable O
affections O
, O
though O
these O
were O
wound O
up O
occasionally O
to O
the O
wildest O
excess O
, O
while O
his O
fortune O
was O
not O
more O
recklessly O
squandered O
than O
his O
attachment O
in O
the O
momentary O
impulse O
of O
an B-TIME
hour E-TIME
. O
As O
, O
therefore O
, O
no O
man O
is O
so O
thoroughly O
excellent O
as O
to O
be O
without O
errors O
, O
neither O
is O
any O
living O
mortal O
so O
depraved O
as O
to O
be O
without O
virtues O
, O
and O
the O
utmost O
extreme O
, O
in O
one S-CARDINAL
respect O
or O
the O
other O
, O
will O
only O
be O
perfected O
in O
an O
eternal O
world O
. O
It O
often O
seems O
to O
an O
observer O
, O
as O
if O
two S-CARDINAL
opposite O
beings O
had O
been O
kneaded O
into O
one O
, O
since O
qualities O
so O
contradictory O
may O
be O
traced O
in O
the O
same O
individual O
. O
Though O
Sir O
Patrick B-PERSON
Dunbar E-PERSON
was O
eager O
and O
rapacious O
in O
acquiring O
money O
, O
and O
would O
incur O
any O
meanness O
to O
avoid O
paying O
it O
, O
he O
seemed O
, O
nevertheless O
, O
lavish O
, O
and O
what O
some O
people O
mis-called O
generous O
, O
in O
squandering O
what O
he O
called O
his O
own O
. O
Though O
cold O
and O
selfish O
in O
general O
, O
some O
fine O
impulses O
had O
been O
in O
his O
nature O
, O
which O
proved O
him O
capable O
of O
vehement O
, O
persevering O
, O
and O
passionate O
attachment O
, O
where O
his O
affections O
, O
or O
rather O
his O
fancy O
, O
had O
been O
once O
engaged O
| | O
while O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
he O
was O
more O
ashamed O
to O
testify O
any O
feeling O
than O
he O
would O
have O
been O
to O
commit O
a O
crime O
, O
and O
endeavored O
to O
blind O
people O
towards O
that O
sensibility O
which O
was O
in O
reality O
the O
redeeming O
point O
in O
his O
character O
, O
by O
talking O
often O
with O
the O
utmost O
contempt O
and O
even O
ridicule O
of O
all O
those O
for O
whom O
he O
might O
have O
been O
supposed O
to O
feel O
the O
weakness O
of O
a O
real O
attachment O
. O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
had O
indeed O
been O
, O
what O
his O
companions O
called O
, O
" O
fairly O
caught O
, O
" O
by O
Clara S-PERSON

and O
his O
heart O
, O
till O
now O
hermetically O
sealed O
against O
all O
real O
confidence O
and O
friendship O
, O
was O
now O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
unclosed O
, O
in O
its O
inmost O
recesses O
, O
while O
even O
his O
hackneyed O
mind O
seemed O
to O
catch O
a O
ray O
of O
light O
and O
warmth O
from O
the O
sunny O
freshness O
and O
purity O
of O
Clara's S-PERSON
intellectual O
mind O
. O
Her O
intelligent O
conversation O
, O
enlivened O
by O
a O
vein O
of O
sly O
pleasing O
humor O
, O
had O
completely O
taken O
him O
by O
surprise O
, O
being O
as O
fresh O
and O
gentle O
as O
a O
summer O
breeze O
, O
while O
her O
appearance O
, O
so O
young O
, O
timid O
, O
and O
lovely O
, O
caused O
the O
eye O
to O
rest O
on O
her O
with O
a O
sentiment O
of O
almost O
melancholy O
interest O
. O
Clara S-PERSON
had O
only O
emerged O
from O
school O
, O
finally O
, O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
days E-DATE
before O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
met O
her O
at O
Lady B-WORK_OF_ART
Towercliffe's E-WORK_OF_ART
, O
and O
her O
extreme O
naivete O
was O
her O
first S-ORDINAL
attraction O
, O
though O
that O
was O
superseded O
before O
long O
by O
still O
greater O
admiration O
, O
while O
he O
became O
hourly O
more O
fascinated O
by O
her O
melancholy O
songs O
and O
thoughtful O
conversation O
. O
To O
Clara S-PERSON
, O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
had O
only O
hitherto O
been O
known O
as O
a O
school O
companion O
of O
her O
brother's O
, O
but O
so O
conscientiously O
did O
Richard B-PERSON
Granville E-PERSON
invariably O
abstain O
from O
evil O
- O
speaking O
, O
that O
, O
even O
where O
justice O
might O
have O
warranted O
the O
severest O
censure O
, O
he O
merely O
became O
silent O
. O
It O
is O
observable O
that O
, O
in O
the O
wisdom O
of O
Providence S-GPE
, O
nothing O
is O
made O
in O
vain O

Even O

their O
important O

in O
the O

, O
when O
properly O
exercised O

such O

all O

Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny's E-PERSON
jilting O
propensities O
were O
the O
less O
dangerous O
, O
from O
their O
being O
so O
generally O
discussed O
in O
society O
, O
as O
few O
were O
willing O
that O
the O
unwary O
should O
suffer O
, O
rather O
than O
his O
faults O

exposed O

Mr. O
Granville S-PERSON
, O
by O
not O
giving O
his O
sister O
timely O
warning O
against O
the O
dissipated O
extravagance O

almost O
infidel O
principles O
of O
his O
old O
school O
- O
companion O
, O
had O
now O
, O
unfortunately O
exposed O
her O
to O
a O
danger O
he O
had O
not O
anticipated O

as O
it O
never O
occurred O

his O
imagination O

in O
its O
wildest O
fancies O

that O
the O
reckless O

dissolute O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
long O
sneered O
at O
marriage O

even O
broken O
that O
holy O
tie O
for O

might O
find O
a O
charm O
in O
the O
pure O

calm O

high O
- O
minded O
Clara S-PERSON
, O
which O
raised O
him O
above O
his O
ordinary O
self O

made O
him O
appear O
all O
she O
could O
most O
like O
or O
admire O

During O
their O
earlier O
intercourse O
, O
she O
saw O
nothing O
in O
his O
conversation O
to O
disapprove O
, O
because O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
most O
unintentionally O
deceived O
her O
into O
a O
belief O
of O
his O
being O
very O
different O
from O
what O
he O
really O
was O
, O
owing O
to O
the O
respect O
with O
which O
he O
treated O
all O
her O
opinions O

and O
only O
when O
he O
talked O
to O
others O
, O
did O
she O
become O
startled O
occasionally O
by O
the O
tone O
of O
careless O
defiance O
with O
which O
he O
spoke O
of O
all O
those O
persons O
and O
things O
which O
she O
was O
most O
accustomed O
to O
reverence O
and O
esteem O
. O
Before O
long O
, O
his O
attachment O
had O
become O
so O
unbounded O
, O
that O
, O
conscious O
he O
could O
not O
obtain O
Clara's S-PERSON
hand O
if O
she O
knew O
his O
real O
character O
, O
he O
assumed O
all O
that O
seemed O
most O
likely O
to O
secure O
her O
confidence O
, O
and O
, O
for O
the O
pleasure O
of O
being O
with O
her O
, O
attended O
church O
regularly O
on O
Sunday S-DATE
at O
the O
village O

Clara S-PERSON
was O
astonished O
at O
his O
evident O
ignorance O
of O
the O
forms O
of O
devotion O

yet O
knowing O
his O
education O
had O
been O
finished O
by O
a O
clergyman O

supposed O
he O
must O
have O
imbibed O
a O
due O
respect O
for O
the O
ordinances O

while O
Lady B-PERSON
Towercliffe E-PERSON
, O
indulging O
her O
usual O
jobbing O
propensities O

was O
enchanted O

make O
up O
a O
match O
of O
any O
kind O
in O
her O
own O
house O

and O
praised O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
as O
the O
most O
immaculate O
and O
perfect O
of O
men O
. O
Clara's S-PERSON
intimacy O
with O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
had O
been O
continually O
increasing O
for O
some O
time O
, O
before O
his O
attention O
became O
so O
very O
obvious O
as O
to O
excite O
her O
peculiar O
interest O
, O
or O
to O
make O
her O
conscious O
of O
a O
necessity O
for O
inquiring O
into O
the O
state O
of O
her O
own O
heart O

but O
, O
upon O
doing O
so O
, O
she O
became O
instantly O
aware O
of O
the O
deep O
hold O
he O
had O
acquired O
over O
her O
thoughts O

His O
frank O

off O

good O

humored O
manner O

enlivened O
her O

at O
length O
his O
ardent O

deeply O

expressed O
with O
all O
the O

in O
the O
gloomy O
recesses O
of O
Mrs. O

school O

learned O
nothing O

her O
heart O

once O

endowed O
Sir O

all O
those O

herself O
to O
the O
most O

of O
all O
earthly O
dreams O

that O
of O
loving O

one O

seemed O
to O
deserve O

to O
return O
her O
attachment O

her O
sole O
hesitation O

accepting O
the O

soon O

they O
ever O

him O

he O
is O
the O
very O
reverse O
of O
all O

It O
would O
be O
extravagant O
to O
waste O
a O
hope O
upon O
the O
reformation O
of O
a O
reckless O
libertine O
, O

thus O

often O

you O

better O

than O
to O
endure O
the O
long O
agony O
of O
an O
unsuitable O
union O
, O
for O
which O
your O
own O
heart O
and O
conscience O
would O
continually O
upbraid O
you O
. O
If O
the O
tenderest O
affection O
of O
a O
brother O
can O
in O
any O
degree O
compensate O
for O
the O
sacrifice O
, O
you O
need O
not O

my O

that O

" O
Had O
the O
grave O
opened O
at O

feet O
, O
she O
could O
scarcely O
have O
been O
more O
startled O
and O
astonished O
than O
by O
the O
contents O
of O
this O
most O
unforeseen O
letter O
, O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
unwelcome O
line O
ever O
received O
from O
Richard S-PERSON

She O
could O
have O
borne O
anything O
but O
to O
find O
her O
lover O
unprincipled O
or O
unworthy O

and O
a O
wintry O
chill O
seemed O
to O
gather O
round O
her O
heart O
, O
while O
, O
with O
a O
stifled O
groan O
which O
struggled O
for O
utterance O
, O
she O
covered O
her O
face O
with O
her O
hand O
, O
and O
sank O
back O
upon O
a O
sofa O
. O
By O
a O
powerful O
effort O

preserved O
herself O

fainting O

she O
was O
resolved O
not O
to O
faint O

she O
did O
not O
— O
but O
in O
the O
secret O
chamber O
of O
her O
heart O
all O
was O
darkness O
, O
loneliness O
, O
and O
grief O
. O
Visions O
of O
earthly O
happiness O
had O
glittered O
for O
a O
time O
, O
in O
brightest O
coloring O
, O
before O
her O
mind O

but O
now O
they O
must O
be O
blotted O
out O
by O
her O
tears O
. O
They O
all O
lay O
prostrate O
and O
disfigured O
at O
her O
feet O
, O
scorched O
and O
blasted O
as O
if O
by O
lightning O
| | O
and O
her O
heart O
, O
bewildered O
by O
a O
multitude O
of O
thoughts O
and O
emotions O
, O
seemed O
full O
almost O
to O
bursting O
. O
Clara S-PERSON
wept O
many O
bitter O
tears O
over O
her O
letter O
, O
and O
she O
not O
only O
wept O
but O
acted O
. O
Without O
delay O
, O
Clara S-PERSON
prepared O
to O
return O
to O
the O
relation O
with O
whom O
, O
during O
her O
brother's O
absence O
, O
she O
usually O
found O
a O
home O
| | O
and O
before O
her O
departure O
, O
not O
only O
wrote O
to O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
, O
stating O
in O
terms O
of O
touching O
grief O
, O
all O
her O
reasons O
for O
so O
suddenly O
and O
unwillingly O
withdrawing O
from O
her O
engagement O
to O
him O
| | O
but O
she O
had O
a O
long O
and O
most O
afflicting O
interview O
with O
him O
, O
vainly O
endeavoring O
to O
convince O
her O
lover O
, O
that O
their O
total O
incompatibility O
of O
sentiment O
raised O
a O
barrier O
between O
them O
, O
which O
forbade O
the O
possibility O
of O
their O
union O
. O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
became O
nearly O
frantic O
with O
vexation O
, O
while O
he O
could O
not O
but O
admire O
the O
beautiful O
grace O
of O
her O
manner O
, O
and O
the O
sorrowful O
modulations O
of O
her O
voice O
when O
she O
spoke O
, O
yet O
unconscious O
how O
completely O
the O
gentle O
Clara S-PERSON
was O
ruled O
by O
principle O
as O
with O
a O
sceptre O
of O
iron O
, O
he O
seemed O
utterly O
unable O
to O
comprehend O
why O
his O
talking O
carelessly O
, O
or O
even O
contemptuously O
of O
religion O
, O
should O
in O
any O
degree O
affect O
the O
preference O
which O
she O
had O
once O
confessed O
for O
him O
, O
and O
which O
he O
felt O
assured O
she O
still O
entertained O
. O
With O
passionate O
vehemence O
he O
urged O
the O
depth O
of O
his O
attachment O
, O
and O
his O
total O
indifference O
to O
everything O
in O
life O
but O
herself O
, O
while O
he O
warmly O
protested O
that O
she O
, O
and O
she O
only O
, O
could O
complete O
the O
reformation O
which O
her O
own O
influence O
had O
already O
begun O
. O
" O
You O

Sir O

clenched O
his O

vehemently O
together O

his O
countenance O
burned O

muttering O
a O
curse O
between O

which O
chilled O
the O
blood O
of O
Clara S-PERSON

walked O
about O

rapidly O
- O
increasing O
excitement O

at O
length O
stopping O
before O
her O

Clara S-PERSON
buried O
her O

feeling O
that O
her O

solitary O
grief O

she O
retraced O
her O
whole O

reflected O

cold O

gather O
around O

trembling O

amidst O
the O

now O
seemed O
like O
some O

by O
the O
broken O
fragments O

that O
Christian S-NORP

in O
her O
amounted O
to O

gazed O
on O

without O
a O

restore O
it O
at O
the O
sacrifice O

determined O

still O
in O
a O
whirlpool O
of O
education O
at O
Mrs. O

exerting O
herself O
more O
zealously O

One B-TIME
evening E-TIME
about O
this O

a O
message O
reached O
Marion S-PERSON

Mrs. O

private O
sitting O

on O
all O
extraordinary O

that O
lady's O
hall O

audience O

a O
solemn O
summons O

which O
was O
usually O
of O
ominous O
import O
. O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
however O
, O
conscious O
that O
her O
own O
recent O
diligence O
had O
been O
quite O
pre-eminent O
, O
and O
her O
success O
most O
distinguished O

heard O
the O
word O

command O
with O
a O
flutter O
of O
pleasing O
anticipation O
, O
for O
to O
her O
the O
future O

always O
full O

Too O
old O
now O
for O
medals O

she O
yet O
indulged O
in O
the O
gay O
recollection O

her O
former O
triumphs O

and O
remembered O
with O
a O
smile O
, O
as O
she O
hurried O
up O
stairs O
, O
how O
often O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
had O
formerly O
declared O
, O
while O
pretending O
to O
frown O
upon O
her O
, O
that O
" O
he O
hated O

see O
girls O
flouncing O
about O

defying O
the O
world O

yet O
how O
silly O

when O
she O
one O
day O
entered O
his O
drawing O

with O
deepening O
color O

a O
look O
of O
modest O
consciousness O

half O
concealing O

half O
displaying O
her O
honors O
, O

had O
advanced O
to O
meet O
her O
, O
wearing O
his O
own O
Grand O
Cross O
of O
the O
Bath O
, O
to O
prove O
, O
as O
he O
said O

that O
he O
was O
indeed O
fit O
company O

so O
meritorious O

with O
a O
buoyant O

joyful O
step O

Marion's S-PERSON
astonishment O

Mrs. O

pacing O
about O

evidently O
in O
a O
state O
of O
furious O
irritation O

while O
in O
her O
hand O
she O
carried O
that O
endless O

the O
growth O
of O
many B-DATE

for O
board O

sundries O

had O
so O
often O
already O
greeted O
the O
unwilling O
eyes O

her O
young O
pupil O

whose O
whole O
inward O
spirit O
recoiled O
with O
shame O

apprehension O

while O
she O
silently O
measured O
the O
length O

breadth O
of O
its O
contents O
, O
every O
item O
of O
which O
she O
already O
knew O
by O
heart O

could O
almost O

gaze O

in O
a O
voice O
that O
made O
the O
gentle O
Marion S-PERSON

cower O
before O

flinging O
it O
furiously O
into O
the O
lap O
of O
Marion S-PERSON

had O
sunk O
upon O

seat O

familiar O

her O
eyes O
on O
the O
unwelcome O

examining O
its O
contents O

her O
thoughts O
were O
in O
the O

time O
painfully O

in O
this O
unexpected O
crisis O

A O
long O
pause O
ensued O

during O

string O

if O
that O

now O
he O
never O

much O

indeed O
to O
be O
quite O
forgotten O
by O
both O
Patrick S-PERSON
and O
Agnes S-PERSON
! O
" O
Marion S-PERSON
paused O
to O
recover O
her O
voice O
, O
and O
to O
choke O
back O
her O
tears O
, O
after O
which O
she O
continued O
in O
a O
firmer O
tone O
, O
while O
Mrs. O
Penfold S-PERSON
listened O
, O
with O
a O
dry O
, O
harsh O
, O
unmoved O
expression O
of O
countenance O
. O
" O
You O
are O
justly O
dissatisfied O
about O
my O
brother's O
payment O
, O
but O
if O
there O
be O
the O
least O
cause O
to O
doubt O
your O
being O
ultimately O
remunerated O
, O
send O
me O
immediately O
home O
. O
I O
dare O
not O
go O
of O
myself O
, O
but O
you O
have O
power O
to O
dismiss O
me O
, O
and O
let O
it O
be O
done O
. O
The O
sorrow O
and O
mortification O
must O
all O
be O
mine O
, O
but O
whatever O
falls O
on O
myself O
alone O
, O
I O
shall O
always O
be O
able O
to O
bear O
. O
" O
" O
Miss O
Dunbar S-PERSON
! O
you O
have O
anticipated O
exactly O
what O
I O
am O
obliged O
to O
do O
, O
and O
what O
it O
would O
have O
been O
well O
for O
me O
if O
I O
had O
done O
sooner O
! O
" O
replied O
Mrs. O
Penfold S-PERSON
, O
angrily O
flouncing O
into O
a O
chair O
, O
and O
pirouetting O
it O
almost O
round O
, O
so O
as O
to O
look O
Marion S-PERSON
full O
in O
the O
face O
. O
" O
I O
am O
sorry O
for O
you O
certainly O
, O
because O
, O
though O
your O
music O
is O
not O
yet O
exactly O
such O
as O
to O
do O
me O
much O
credit O
, O
and O
your O
Italian S-NORP
is O
sometimes O
far O
from O
grammatical O
, O
yet O
on O
the O
whole O
there O
cannot O
be O
a O
better O
- O
disposed O
girl O
, O
nor O
one O
who O
has O
testified O
a O
more O
constant O
desire O
to O
please O
me O
. O
" O
Marion's S-PERSON
heart O
was O
melted O
by O
even O
this O
very O
slight O
expression O
of O
regard O
, O
and O
nothing O
could O
exceed O
the O
troubled O
beauty O
of O
her O
eyes O
, O
when O
she O
raised O
them O
gratefully O
to O
Mrs. O
Penfold S-PERSON
, O
but O
conscious O
that O
her O
presence O
was O
not O
exactly O
the O
place O
for O
a O
scene O
, O
as O
that O
lady O
had O
long O
been O
considered O
incapable O
of O
a O
tear O
or O
a O
smile O
, O
she O
averted O
her O
face O
, O
and O
struggled O
for O
composure O
. O
" O
I O
have O
learned O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
to O
- O
day O
. O
" O
resumed O
Mrs. O
Penfold S-PERSON
, O
her O
voice O
becoming O
more O
stern O
as O
she O
proceeded O
, O
" O
that O
before O
your O
father's O
death O
, O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
twice O
, O
in O
the O
most O
profligate O
manner O
, O
paid O
off O
his O
creditors O
with O
a O
shilling O
in O
the O
pound O
! O
In O
consequence O
of O
great O
losses O
now O
at O
the O
Doncaster S-GPE
races O
, O
and O
having O
paid O
what O
he O
calls O
his O
debts O
of O
honor O
to O
a O
ruinous O
amount O
, O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
has O
yesterday S-DATE
fled O
to O
the O
sanctuary O
at O
Holyrood B-FAC
House E-FAC
for O
refuge O
, O
and O
the O
creditors O
have O
already O
seized O
everything O
. O
No O
wonder O
indeed O
! O
it O
was O
full O
time O
! O
He O
is O
all O
promise O
and O
no O
performance O
, O
— O
for O
ever O
feeding O
us O
with O
empty O
spoons O
! O
" O
Mrs. O
Penfold S-PERSON
angrily O
changed O
her O
position O
, O
and O
with O
another O
indignant O
glance O
at O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
continued O
, O
" O
Even O
Sir O
Patrick's S-PERSON
large O
rent O
- O
roll O
would O
scarcely O
suffice O
in O
a O
life O

time O
to O
pay O

half S-CARDINAL

off O

Good O
worthy O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
too O
, O
his O
own O
uncle O

he O
has O
cheated O

, O
we O
have O
only O
Sir O
Patrick's S-PERSON
life O
to O
depend O
upon O
for O
what O

! O
This O
is O
a O
very O
heavy O
blow O
to O
me O
, O
and O
extremely O
hard O
to O
bear O
! O
" O
While O
thus O
bemoaning O
herself O
. O
Mrs. O
Penfold S-PERSON
forgot O
, O
like O
most O
selfish O
people O
, O
that O
any O
one O
had O
to O
suffer O
besides O
, O
though O
the O
parted O
lips O
, O
the O
tearful O
eyes O
, O
and O
the O
pallid O
cheek O
of O
Marion S-PERSON
testified O
in O
a O
language O
not O
to O
be O
mistaken O
, O
the O
depth O
and O
intensity O
of O
her O
grief O
, O
while O
with O
astonishment O
and O
dismay O
, O
she O
heard O
this O
short O
summary O
of O
Sir O
Patrick's S-PERSON
history O
and O
circumstances O
. O
Long O
after O
Mrs. O
Penfold S-PERSON
had O
ceased O
to O
speak O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
gazed O
in O
her O
face O
, O
as O
if O
expecting O
more O
, O
while O
her O
every O
nerve O
continued O
quivering O
with O
agitation O
, O
till O
at O
length O
she O
closed O
her O
eyes O
in O
speechless O
agony O
, O
bewildered O
by O
the O
sudden O
transition O
from O
joyful O
anticipation O
to O
blank O
despair O
. O
Formerly O
she O
had O
heard O
of O
difficulties O
and O
bankruptcies O
, O
as O
she O
had O
heard O
of O
the O
plague O
or O
the O
bow O
- O
string O
at O
Constantinople S-GPE
— O
things O
dreadful O
to O
those O
who O
might O
be O
affected O
by O
them O
, O
but O
quite O
foreign O
to O
herself O
, O
and O
now O
, O
like O
a O
clap O
of O
thunder O
, O
all O
had O
suddenly O
burst O
over O
the O
heads O
of O
those O
who O
were O
nearest O
and O
dearest O
to O
her O
, O
with O
apparently O
destructive O
effect O
. O
She O
yet O
felt O
as O
if O
the O
whole O
were O
some O
hideous O
dream O
from O
which O
it O
might O
be O
possible O
to O
awaken O
, O
— O
the O
voice O
of O
Mrs. O
Penfold S-PERSON
rang O
painfully O
on O
her O
ears O
, O
— O
every O
surrounding O
object O
faded O
from O
her O
vision O
, O
— O
her O
thoughts O
became O
confused O
, O
— O
a O
vague O
sense O
of O
burning O
misery O
was O
at O
her O
heart O
, O
— O
and O
one O
only O
wish O
remained O
distinctly O
prominent O
on O
her O
mind O
— O
the O
wish O
to O
be O
alone O
. O
" O
Indeed O
, O
Miss O
Dunbar S-PERSON
, O
" O
continued O
Mrs. O
Penfold S-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
monotonous O
complaining O
voice O
, O
" O
no O
wonder O
you O
are O
shocked O
that O
I O
who O
have O
labored O
so O
hard O

swindled O
out O

" O
on O
account O
of O
his O
having O
so O
often O
already O
played O
a O
similar O
game O
, O
but O
once O
catch O
him O
beyond O
the O
bounds O
of O
Holyrood S-GPE

he'll O
never O

at O
liberty O

try O
such O
manœuvres O
again O

are O

offer O
a O
reward O

his O
apprehension O

" O
My O
poor O
uncle O

" O
exclaimed O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
voice O
of O
anguish O
, O
while O
hot O
tears O
fell O
like O
rain O
over O
her O
cheek O
, O
and O
a O
confused O
apprehension O
of O
ruin O
, O
bankruptcy O
, O
and O
disgrace O
hovered O
darkly O
through O
her O
mind O
, O
though O
she O
scarcely O
yet O
knew O
what O

Mrs. O
Penfold S-PERSON
most O
heartily O
seconded O
her O
pupil's O
desire O
to O
depart O
, O
while O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
heaviest O
pangs O
which O
Marion S-PERSON
had O
to O
endure O
on O
this O
occasion O

sprang O
from O
the O

her O

ci-devant O
preceptress O
appeared O
about O

bid O
her O
a O
last O
farewell O
. O
A O
tumult O
of O
gossiping O
wonder O
and O
curiosity O
arose O
among O
the O
pupils O
, O
when O
it O
became O
whispered O
that O
Marion S-PERSON
was O
to O
" O
leave O
" O
on O
an O
hour's O
notice O
. O
Many O
questions O
were O
asked O
, O
much O
astonishment O
was O
expressed O
, O
and O
even O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
real O
sympathy O
excited O
, O
but O
Marion S-PERSON
shrank O
from O
the O
clamorous O
exclamations O
of O
her O
young O
companions O
, O
who O
could O
not O
so O
much O
as O
guess O
the O
measure O
and O
depth O
of O
her O
misfortunes O
. O
Often O
had O
she O
shared O
their O
sorrows O
, O
and O
willingly O
would O
she O
have O
accepted O
any O
consolation O
they O
could O
offer O
, O
but O
the O
worst O
of O
her O
trials O
could O
not O
be O
spoken O
to O
mortal O
ears O
, O
and O
in O
lamenting O
for O
her O
brother's O
disgrace O
, O
she O
could O
only O
bear O
her O
wound O
, O
like O
a O
stricken O
deer O
, O
into O
solitude O

silence O

There O
are O
insects O
that O
live O
a O
life O

time O

hour O

the O

heavy O
with O
sorrow O

anxiety O

she O
slowly O
retraced O
her O
steps O

and O
on O
reaching O
her O
room O
, O
sank O
upon O
her O
bed O
in O
a O
paroxysm O
of O
tears O

delivering O
herself O
up O
to O
many O
painful O
thoughts O

rather O
to O
her O
feelings O

under O
the O
most O
painful O
of O
all O

a O
gasp O
of O
rest O
from O
their O
labors O
during O
the O
day O

that O
they O
gathered O
in O

at O

to O
criticise O
a O
hackney O

very O
tired O

down O
looking O

in O
waiting O

while O
the O
pupils O
all O
watched O
for O
Marion's S-PERSON
departure O

anxious O
to O
catch O
a O
last O
glimpse O
of O

ever O

her O
interview O

tried O

occupy O
herself O
in O
packing O
up O
her O

to O
control O
her O
emotion O
, O
she O
turned O
away O
her O
head O

burst O
into O
an O
agony O

tears O

said O
Mrs. O

hastily O
advancing O
, O
with O
a O
look O
of O
irritable O
vexation O

" O
No O
wonder O
you O
are O
sorrow O

leave O
us O

what O
can't O

be O
endured O

Remember O
to O
be O
diligent O
in O
practising O
your O
music O

the O
success O

only O

am O
ever O

faltered O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
while O
a O
flash O
of O
bright O
intelligence O
lighted O
up O
her O
eyes O

us O

added O
Mrs. O
Penfold S-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
tone O
that O
sounded O
marvellously O
sincere O
. O
" O
I O
really O
do O

Whatever O

your O
misfortune O

" O
One S-CARDINAL

whispered O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
coloring O
the O
deepest O
carnation O
, O
and O
leading O
the O
way O
to O
an O
inner O
room O
, O
while O
Mrs. O
Penfold S-PERSON
followed O
, O
with O
an O
air O
of O
royal O
condescension O

" O
The O
fault O
is O
indeed O

you O
kindly O
remark O

for O
my O
sake O

Mrs. O
Penfold S-PERSON
, O
spare O
my O
brother's O
name O
in O
all O
you O
say O

It O
gives O
me O
pleasure O
to O
think O
that O
I O
can O
do O
something O
towards O
settling O
our O
account O
myself O
, O
and O
I O
would O
think O
no O
sacrifice O
worth O
a O
thought O

that O
enabled O
me O
to O
do O
so O

My O
mother's O
trinkets O
were O
divided O
between O
Agnes S-PERSON

me O

besides O
which O
my O
dear O
kind O
uncle O
has O
been O
lavish O
in O
his O

This O
gold O

Well O

my O

interrupted O
Mrs. O

, O
relaxing O
into O
a O
look O
of O
graciousness O

" O
The O
bright O
eyes O
of O
Marion S-PERSON
were O
dimmed O
with O
tears O
of O
sincerity O

emotion O
when O
she O
concluded O

, O
placing O

Mrs. O

astonished O
hands O

out O

Giving O
a O
last O
, O
long O
look O
at O
those O
inanimate O
objects O
to O

she O

final O
adieu O

Marion S-PERSON
threw O
herself O
into O
the O
carriage O

drove O
off O

so O
overpowered O
with O
anguish O
and O
anxiety O
respecting O
her O
brother O
, O
that O
she O
scarcely O
noticed O
the O
phalanx O
of O
white O
pocket O
handkerchiefs O

waved O
to O
her O
as O
a O
last O
farewell O
from O
those O

among O
whom O
so O
large O
a O
share O

hitherto O

she O
took O
a O
final O
farewell O

CHAPTER O
XI O
. O
Marion B-PERSON
Dunbar E-PERSON
being O
by O
no O
means O
an O
arrant O
novel O
reader O
, O
knew O
nothing O
of O
those O
artificial O
feelings O
which O
too O
often O
obliterated O
the O
reality O
. O
Simple O
as O
a O
field O
- O
flower O
, O
her O
natural O
sensibility O
remained O
perfectly O
fresh O
and O
unimpaired O
, O
while O
now O
, O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
, O
experiencing O
the O
withering O
disappointments O
, O
and O
blighting O
anxieties O
of O
life O
. O
As O
she O
drove O
slowly O
along O
towards O
the O
sanctuary O
where O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
had O
taken O
refuge O
, O
the O
most O
prominent O
apprehension O
on O
her O
mind O
, O
was O
that O
of O
finding O
him O
on O
the O
eve O
of O
imprisonment O
| | O
but O
she O
in O
some O
degree O
consoled O
herself O
by O
imagining O
the O
services O
that O
in O
such O
circumstances O
she O
might O
perhaps O
be O
able O
to O
do O
him O
, O
and O
the O
privations O
she O
could O
endure O
for O
his O
sake O
. O
The O
more O
proud O
, O
overbearing O
, O
and O
arbitrary O
, O
he O
had O
hitherto O
been O
, O
the O
more O
touching O
it O
appeared O
to O
her O
affectionate O
spirit O
, O
that O
one O
seemed O
born O
to O
command O
, O
should O
now O
be O
humbled O
| | O
and O
impatiently O
did O
she O
long O
to O
prove O
, O
that O
, O
however O
all O
things O
might O
alter O
, O
yet O
, O
in O
prosperity O
or O
adversity O
, O
in O
sickness O
or O
in O
health O
, O
she O
was O
unchangeably O
the O
same O
| | O
while O
her O
young O
heart O
glowed O
with O
the O
paramount O
hope O
of O
at O
last O
becoming O
useful O
to O
her O
brother O
, O
and O
therefore O
welcome O
. O
As O
she O
proceeded O
, O
visions O
of O
deep O
distress O
and O
difficulty O
floated O
dimly O
through O
the O
mind O
of O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
who O
could O
not O
entirely O
close O
her O
eyes O
against O
the O
iron O
truths O
, O
and O
stern O
realities O
of O
life O
, O
while O
considering O
how O
totally O
unsuited O
her O
brother O
was O
, O
to O
endure O
the O
privation O
of O
a O
single O
luxury O
, O
and O
now O
he O
could O
scarcely O
have O
enough O
to O
command O
the O
most O
ordinary O
necessaries O
. O
In O
the O
mind O
of O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
immediate O
starvation O
, O
and O
going O
out O
as O
a O
governess O
, O
were O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
ideas O
that O
most O
prominently O
connected O
themselves O
with O
the O
consciousness O
of O
being O
ruined O
| | O
for O
her O
conception O
of O
bankruptcy O
was O
of O
the O
most O
terrifying O
description O
. O
In O
the O
few O
novels O
she O
had O
ever O
seen O
, O
the O
heroines O
could O
always O
support O
themselves O
by O
selling O
their O
drawings O
| | O
but O
Marion S-PERSON
did O
not O
hope O
to O
gain O
an O
independent O
livelihood O
by O
her O
slanting O
castles O
, O
and O
top O
- O
heavy O
trees O
, O
though O
taking O
in O
plain O
work O
, O
or O
teaching O
music O
, O
suggested O
themselves O
as O
possible O
resources O
. O
Marion S-PERSON
thought O
of O
arrests O
, O
bailiffs O
, O
writs O
, O
and O
of O
the O
world O
come O
to O
an O
end O
. O
The O
sunny O
hours O
of O
her O
life O
seemed O
suddenly O
darkened O
, O
and O
she O
had O
grown O
old O
in O
a O
day O
! O
In O
the O
simplicity O
of O
her O
heart O
, O
she O
imagined O
that O
a O
ruined O
man O
of O
rank O
and O
fashion O
, O
was O
like O
a O
ruined O
man O
in O
earnest O
| | O
obliged O
actually O
to O
reduce O
his O
establishment O
! O
to O
dismiss O
his O
servants O
! O
to O
dispose O
of O
his O
equipages O
! O
to O
make O
an O
auction O
of O
his O
furniture O
! O
to O
part O
with O
his O
plate O
! O
and O
really O
to O
live O
as O
if O
he O
were O
in O
downright O
matter O
- O
of O
- O
fact O
earnest O
, O
poor O
! O
" O
to O
exist O
, O
" O
as O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
once O
contemptuously O
said O
of O
Richard B-PERSON
Granville E-PERSON
, O
" O
on O
twopence O
a O
year O
, O
paid O
quarterly S-DATE

" O
The O
slow O
- O
moving O
hackney O
- O
coach O
stopped O
at O
last O
before O
the O
gate O
of O
Sir O
Patrick's S-PERSON
new O
residence O
, O
St. B-FAC
John's I-FAC
Lodge E-FAC
, O
a O
gloomy O
antique O
villa O
near O
Holyrood B-FAC
House E-FAC
, O
with O
gabled O
windows O
, O
stone O
balconies O
, O
richly O
carved O
balustrades O
, O
and O
pointed O
roof O
, O
surrounded O
by O
dusty O
beech O
- O
trees O
, O
and O
formal O
yew O
hedges O
, O
clipped O
into O
fifty S-CARDINAL
unimaginable O
shapes O
. O
Marion S-PERSON
was O
surprised O
, O
on O
hastily O
alighting O
, O
to O
perceive O
the O
whole O
house O
glittering O
with O
lights O
, O
and O
would O
have O
supposed O
she O
had O
made O
some O
mistake O
, O
had O
not O
the O
bell O
been O
instantly O
answered O
by O
Sir O
Patrick's S-PERSON
own O
man O
, O
followed O
by O
the O
usual O
three S-CARDINAL
yellow O
- O
plush O
footmen O
. O
" O
Faithful O
creatures O
! O
" O
thought O
she O
, O
having O
often O
heard O
of O
old O
servants O
who O
insisted O
on O
being O
retained O
for O
nothing O
| | O
" O
amidst O
all O
Patrick's O
distress O
, O
this O
must O
indeed O
be O
gratifying O
! O
" O
In O
a O
tumult O
of O
emotion O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
throwing O
off O
her O
bonnet O
, O
rushed O
up O
a O
broad O
well O
- O
lighted O
flight O
of O
stairs O
, O
while O
, O
wound O
up O
to O
a O
pitch O
of O
heroism O
and O
romantic O
self O
- O
devotion O
, O
she O
thought O
only O
of O
her O
brother O
, O
impatiently O
longing O
to O
fly O
into O
his O
arms O
, O
and O
to O
express O
the O
whole O
fulness O
of O
her O
affection O
, O
and O
the O
whole O
depth O
of O
her O
sympathy O
. O
While O
her O
heart O
sprang O
forward O
to O
meet O
him O
, O
she O
eagerly O
threw O
open O
a O
door O
next O
the O
staircase O
, O
and O
entered O
with O
a O
hurried O
and O
tremulous O
step O
| | O
but O
suddenly O
her O
eyes O
were O
dazzled O
and O
bewildered O
by O
the O
sight O
which O
met O
her O
agitated O
glance O
, O
while O
for O
a O
moment O
she O
became O
rooted O
to O
the O
floor O
, O
like O
one O
who O
had O
been O
stunned O
by O
a O
sudden O
blow O
. O
Marion S-PERSON
gazed O
without O
seeing O
, O
and O
heard O
without O
knowing O
what O
was O
said O
, O
so O
unexpected O
and O
surprising O
was O
the O
scene O
to O
which O
she O
had O
thus O
suddenly O
introduced O
herself O
! O
A O
murmur O
of O
noise O
and O
gayety O
rang O
in O
her O
ears O
, O
while O
the O
whole O
apartment O
was O
brilliantly O
illuminated O
, O
and O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
object O
which O
became O
distinct O
to O
her O
vision O
was O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
, O
seated O
at O
the O
head O
of O
a O
superbly O
- O
decorated O
dinner O
- O
table O
, O
in O
a O
perfect O
uproar O
of O
merriment O
and O
hilarity O
. O
Around O
him O
were O
placed O
five S-CARDINAL
or O
six S-CARDINAL
of O
his O
gayest O
associates O

dressed O
in O
their O
scarlet O
hunting O

evidently O
in O
joyous O
spirit O
, O

while O
the O
whole O

aspect O

laughing O
in O
merry O
chorus O
, O
and O
with O
claret O
circulating O
at O
full O
speed O
round O
the O
hospitable O
board O
. O
Marion S-PERSON
felt O
as O
if O
her O
feet O
had O
lost O
all O
power O
of O
motion O
, O
while O
, O
grasping O
the O
handle O
of O
the O
door O
with O
one S-CARDINAL
hand O
, O
and O
shading O
her O
eyes O
with O
the O
other O
, O
she O
became O
transfixed O
to O
the O
spot O
. O
It O
was O
a O
shock O
of O
unexpected O
joy O
, O
and O
while O
standing O
in O
the O
deep O
embrasure O
of O
the O
door O
, O
her O
large O
eyes O
dilated O
, O
and O
her O
lips O
parted O
, O
with O
an O
expression O
of O
speechless O
amazement O
, O
she O
looked O
like O
a O
breathing O
portrait O
, O
which O
an O
artist O
might O
have O
shown O
as O
his O
master O
- O

— O
young O
, O
bright O
, O
and O
graceful O
, O
as O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
crescent O
of O
the O
moon O
, O
or O
like O
the O
fabled O
houri O
of O
an O
eastern O
tale O
. O
The O
gentlemen O
all O
instinctively O
stood O
up O
with O
one S-CARDINAL
accord O
the O
moment O
she O
appeared O
, O
giving O
her O
looks O
of O
embarrassed O
astonishment O
and O
admiration O
, O
while O
Marion S-PERSON
hastily O
retreating O
, O
in O
an O
agony O
of O
confusion O
, O
heard O
her O
own O
voice O
inadvertently O
exclaim O
, O
" O

" O
" O
Marion S-PERSON

" O
cried O
her O
brother O
, O
in O
a O
frenzy O
of O
astonishment O
more O
than O
equal O
to O
her O
own O
, O
while O
the O
flowing O
bumper O
which O
had O
been O
raised O
to O
his O
lips O
remained O
suspended O
there O
, O
and O
in O
an O
instant O
afterwards O
, O
his O
tone O
of O
surprise O
became O
changed O
into O
angry O
imperative O
remonstrance O
. O
" O
Marion S-PERSON

you O
here O
, O

" O
Before O
she O
had O
quite O
retreated O
, O
suspecting O
the O
real O
state O
of O
the O
case O
, O
and O
not O
wishing O
for O
any O
public O
explanation O
, O
Sir O

added O
, O
in O
an O
accent O
of O
careless O
good O
humor O
, O
" O

not O
large O

puzzle O

" O
thought O
the O
delighted O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
vanishing O
in O
a O
transport O
of O
joy O
, O
while O
her O
brother's O
jovial O
companions O
became O
vehemently O
energetic O
in O
expressing O
their O
admiration O
of O

" O

a O

the O

interrupted O
Sir O

in O
a O
rallying O
tone O

his O

vivacity O
of O
one O

vehemently O

suddenly O

his O

his O
eye O

pushed O
the O

round O

observed O
with O
astonishment O

became O
violently O
compressed O

his O
white O

visibly O
paler O

bright O
flash O

silence O

CHAPTER O
XII O
. O
One S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
greatest O
pleasures O
in O
life O
is O
derived O
from O
the O
unexpectedness O
of O
events O
, O
without O
which O
existence O
would O
lose O
much O
of O
its O
interest O
, O
and O
finding O
herself O
thus O
emancipated O
from O
school O
, O
settled O
at O
home O
, O
and O
relieved O
from O
her O
worst O
fears O
respecting O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
, O
Marion S-PERSON
no O
sooner O
escaped O
from O
her O
unexpected O
glimpse O
of O
the O
jovial O
party O
in O
the O
dining O
- O
room O
, O
than O
, O
lightly O
carolling O
some O
snatches O
of O
a O
popular O
song O
, O
she O
flew O
up O
stairs O
the O
happiest O
of O
the O
happy O
, O
to O
find O
the O
scene O
of O
Agnes' S-PERSON
toilette O
, O
whom O
she O
discovered O
at O
last O
all O
joy O
and O
flutter O
at O
the O
prospect O
of O
a O
ball O
at O
Lady B-FAC
Towercliffe's E-FAC
in O
the O
palace O
. O
The O
softening O
effect O
of O
happiness O
on O
stern O
and O
rugged O
natures O
has O
been O
often O
remarked O
, O
but O
selfishness O
never O
slumbers O
, O
and O
the O
reception O
Agnes S-PERSON
bestowed O
on O
Marion S-PERSON
partook O
more O
of O
astonishment O
than O
of O
pleasure O
, O
and O
was O
mingled O
much O
more O
with O
censure O
than O
with O
approbation O
. O
Still O
, O
after O
expressing O
more O
wonder O
than O
the O
occasion O
called O
for O
, O
what O
could O
possibly O
have O
brought O
her O
home O
, O
and O
the O
most O
unbounded O
censure O
of O
Mrs. O
Penfold S-PERSON
for O
her O
" O
unjustifiable O
conduct O
" O
in O
sending O
her O
, O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
having O
no O
one O
better O
, O
or O
rather O
no O
one O
else O
to O
talk O
to O
, O
though O
not O
violently O
delighted O
at O
the O
unexpected O
meeting O
, O
gave O
some O
fragments O
of O
her O
attention O
to O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
whose O
deep O
tender O
eyes O
were O
sparkling O
with O
affectionate O
pleasure O
on O
again O
seeing O
her O
sister O
, O
while O
her O
countenance O
, O
from O
recent O
agitation O
, O
looked O
like O
an O
April S-DATE
face O
of O
smiles O
and O
tears O
. O
" O
What O
a O
storm O
in O
a O
tea-cup O
you O
have O
had O
at O
Mrs. O
Penfold's S-PERSON
! O
tiresome O
old O
cat O
! O
I O
am O
glad O
it O
teased O
her O
! O
Dixon S-PERSON
! O
pin O
that O
wreath O
more O
to O
the O
right O
: O
— O
not O
quite O
so O
far O
! O
there O
! O
— O
oh O
! O
how O
perfect O
! O
" O
said O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
gazing O
with O
exultation O
at O
her O
own O
extraordinary O
beauty O
. O
" O
Pat S-PERSON
must O
find O
out O
some O
other O
school O
for O
you O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
! O
It O
would O
never O
do O
to O
stay O
idling O
here O
! O
Dixon S-PERSON
! O
never O
shew O
me O
that O
dress O
again O
! O
Wear O
it O
yourself O
or O
burn O
it O
, O
but O
blue O
always O
looks O
vulgar O
! O
I O
have O
lucky O
and O
unlucky O
gowns O
! O
Some O
in O
which O
I O
meet O
with O
all O
the O
friends O
I O
wish O
to O
meet O
, O
and O
dance O
with O
all O
the O
partners O
I O
prefer O
, O
but O
that O
dress O
is O
a O
happy O
riddance O
. O
I O
remember O
once O
being O
obliged O
, O
when O
wearing O
it O
, O
to O
dance O
three S-CARDINAL
times O
and O
go O
to O
supper O
with O
stupid O
, O
tiresome O
Lord O
Wigton S-PERSON
! O
Dixon S-PERSON
! O
fetch O
my O
bouquet O
! O
not O
that O
withered O
old O
thing O
, O
but O
the O
one O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
brought O
me O
to O
- O
night O
. O
Fetch O
it O
from O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
. O
" O
" O
So O
that O
horrid O
Dixon S-PERSON
is O
still O
with O
you O
! O
" O
whispered O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
abigail's O
last O
frill O
disappeared O
. O
" O
I O
very O
seldom O
dislike O
anybody O
, O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
but O
she O
is O
very O
odd O
. O
There O
is O
a O
strange O
gleam O
about O
her O
eyes O
, O
which O
look O
so O
sharp O
and O
penetrating O
, O
they O
have O
prongs O
that O
pierce O
when O
they O
are O
turned O
on O
me O
. O
" O
" O
Yes O
! O
" O
said O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
laughing O
, O
" O
she O
does O
sometimes O
look O
through O
me O
till O
I O
feel O
myself O
nailed O
to O
the O
wall O
. O
" O
" O
Moreover O
, O
she O
has O
such O
a O
flattering O
, O
fawning O
, O
cunning O
manner O
, O
that O
I O
wonder O
you O
can O
tolerate O
her O
for O
an O
hour O
, O
" O
continued O
Marion S-PERSON
. O
" O
We O
know O
so O
little O
of O
her O
, O
too O
, O
that O
she O
is O
like O
a O
person O
fallen O
from O
the O
clouds O
! O
" O
" O
Oh O
! O
there O
you O
are O
wrong O
, O
for O
Lady B-PERSON
Towercliffe E-PERSON
says O
she O
is O
' O
a O
perfect O
treasure O
! O
' O
Consider O
, O
too O
, O
what O
low O
terms O
she O
accepts O
, O
merely O
from O
her O
desire O
to O
serve O
me O
! O
I O
never O
saw O
a O
creature O
so O
preternaturally O
anxious O
to O
be O
taken O
, O
and O
now O
, O
after O
two B-DATE
years' E-DATE
practice O
, O
she O
really O
is O
excellent O
. O
Do O
you O
remember O
at O
the O
time O
I O
engaged O
Dixon S-PERSON
, O
what O
a O
perfect O
romance O
her O
history O
was O
! O
Pat S-PERSON
did O
not O
believe O
a O
word O
of O
it O
| | O
but O
to O
do O
her O
justice O
, O
she O
made O
it O
very O
entertaining O
. O
I O
hope O
, O
at O
least O
, O
the O
greater O
part O
was O
founded O
on O
fact O
! O
" O
" O
Why O
does O
she O
wear O
widow's O
weeds O
, O
— O
she O
did O
not O
mention O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
having O
ever O
been O
married O
! O
" O
" O
No O
more O
she O
did O
! O
how O
strangely O
beautiful O
she O
looks O
in O
them O
, O
like O
the O
abbess O
of O
a O
convent O
! O
Her O
husband O
, O
if O
ever O
she O
had O
one O

which O
I O
doubt O

I O
tell O
him O
it O
must O
positively O
have O
been O
with O
old O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
for O
she O
started O
so O
visibly O
one O
day O
long O
ago O
, O
and O
became O
redder O
than O

when O
I O
said O

was O
coming O
to O
dinner O

" O
Seeing O
Agnes S-PERSON
in O
so O
unusually O
gracious O
and O
communicative O
a O
mood O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
ventured O
now O
to O
inquire O
into O
the O
state O
of O
her O
brother's O
affairs O
, O
saying O
, O
she O
supposed O

must O
inevitably O
sell O
his O
estate O
, O
go O
abroad O
, O
or O
retrench O

expedient O
of O
planting O
half B-MONEY
- I-MONEY

, O
to O
grow O
into O
guineas O

had O
not O
yet O
been O
brought O
to O
perfection O
, O
even O
by O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
, O
though O
it O
had O
so O
long O
been O
a O
subject O
of O
wonder O
how O
he O
contrived O
to O
get O
on O
. O
" O
This O
has O
been O
a O
horrid O
business O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
Agnes S-PERSON
peevishly O

" O
as O
for O
Pat S-PERSON
himself O
, O
he O
will O
do O
very O
well O
! O
Trust O
him O
for O
taking O
care O
of O
that O

He O
has O
always O
money O
enough O
and O
to O
spare O
for O
his O
own O
amusement O
, O

sometimes O
he O
would O
hardly O
even O
pay O
the O
postage O
of O
a O
letter O

save O
my O
life O

Only O
think O
of O
his O
bringing O
me O
here O

out O
of O
everybody's O
way O

during O
the O
most O
beautiful O

shall O

been O
at O
the O
moment O
, O
drew O
up O
, O
for O
a O
frolic O
, O
precisely O
such O
an O
agreement O
for O
themselves O
, O
which O
they O
signed O
and O
sealed O
, O
making O
some O
of O
the O
150 S-CARDINAL
strangers O
present O
act O
as O
witnesses O
. O
The O
whole O
affair O
had O
been O
long O
forgotten O
, O
when O
Mr. O
Granville S-PERSON
married O
some O
fright O
of O
a O
girl O
, O
all O
nose O
and O
freckles O
, O
merely O
because O
of O
her O
being O
amiable O
, O
or O
some O
such O
whim O
. O
She O
lived O
long O
enough O
to O
make O
saints O
of O
the O
whole O
family O
, O
and O
died O
after O
her O
son O
and O
daughter O
were O
only B-DATE
a I-DATE
few I-DATE
years I-DATE
old E-DATE
. O
" O
" O
Then O
how O
is O
your O
quarrel O
with O
Clara S-PERSON
tacked O
on O
to O
this O
affair O
, O
I O
cannot O
quite O
trace O
the O
connexion O
. O
" O
" O
Why O
! O
Pat S-PERSON
has O
been O
very O
angry O
at O
Mr. O
Granville S-PERSON
lately O
about O
some O
unexplainable O
affront O
| | O
so O
, O
having O
accidentally O
found O
the O
old O
Harrowgate S-ORG
document O
, O
and O
being O
very O
hard O
up O
for O
money O
, O
he O
and O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
are O
threatening O
to O
levy O
the O
fine O
of O
£ O
10,000 S-MONEY
due O
to O
each O
of O
them O
, O
and O
poor O
Mr. O
Granville S-PERSON
is O
, O
as O
you O
may O
suppose O
, O
rather O
indignant O
, O
having O
been O
all O
his O
life O
stringing O
halfpence O
together O
, O
to O
pay O
off O
his O
father's O
debts O
, O
though O
no O
one O
could O
legally O
oblige O
him O
. O
As O
Pat S-PERSON
says O
, O
' O
more O
fool O
he O
! O
' O
You O
know O
our O
brother's O
favorite O

any O

" O
" O
What O
a O
shocking O
affair O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
coloring O
with O
shame O
and O
indignation O
. O
" O
As O
uncle O
Arthur S-PERSON

, O
Patrick S-PERSON
would O
do O
anything O

of O

Surely O
, O
Agnes S-PERSON

he O
cannot O
be O

" O
" O
Pshaw O

never O

replied O
Agnes S-PERSON
impatiently O

" O
we O

fancy O

down O

passion O

at O
so O
great O
an O
expense O

take O
a O
wing O

sell O
off O
all O

again O

whole O

now O
lay O
in O
fragments O
on O

delivered O
herself O
up O

agonies O

lamentation O

scolding O

over O

consternation O

" O
fall O

a O
proverbial O
trial O

temper O

up O

the O
strange O
wild O
expression O

gleamed O

certainly O

for O
an O
instant O
, O
a O
dark O
smile O

malignant O
satisfaction O

sure O

her O
forehead O

deadly O
paleness O

when O
she O
caught O
the O
eye O

earnestly O
fixed O
upon O
her O
, O

started O
up O

frown O

angry O
defiance O

close O
up O

all O
she O

observed O
during O
that O
evening O
in O
the O
very O
lowest O
whisper O
, O
for O
Marion S-PERSON
felt O
a O
nervous O
consciousness O
that O
Dixon S-PERSON
was O
not O
far O
off O
, O
and O
might O
attempt O
to O
overhear O
them O
. O
A O
stealthy O
step O
was O
heard O
on O
the O
stair O
after O
she O
concluded O
, O
but O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
thoroughly O
engrossed O
with O
the O
subject O
, O
reiterated O
once O
more O
her O
conviction O
that O
there O
had O
been O
something O
more O
than O
common O
in O
the O
manner O
of O
Dixon S-PERSON
, O
whom O
she O
advised O
Agnes S-PERSON
to O
watch O
very O
carefully O
, O
if O
she O
did O
not O
part O
with O
her O
soon O
. O
" O
You O
were O
always O
prejudiced O
against O
Dixon S-PERSON
, O
poor O
stupid O
fool O
that O
she O
is O
, O
Marion S-PERSON

I O
wish O
I O
had O
sent O
her O
adrift O
before O
she O
broke O
all O
the O
china O

but O
it O
is O
very O

severe O

can O
you O
fancy O
the O
creature O
did O
it O
on O
purpose O
? O
That O
is O
too O
bad O

when O
you O
might O
have O
seen O
how O
ghastly O
pale O
she O
became O
! O
" O
" O
I O
did O
see O
, O
Agnes S-PERSON

that O
makes O
me O
wonder O
only O
the O
more O
! O
No O
one O
ever O
looked O
like O
that O
surely O

you O

good O

CHAPTER O
XIII O
. O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
, O
like O
most O
men O
who O
are O
gifted O
with O
more O
head O
than O
heart O
, O
disbelieved O
in O
all O
such O
generous O
emotions O
and O
exalted O
affections O
as O
he O
had O
not O
himself O
experienced O
. O
With O
a O
lively O
defiance O
of O
received O
opinions O
, O
his O
vivacity O
was O
unchecked O
by O
the O
fear O
of O
giving O
pain O
or O
of O
causing O
offence O
, O
being O
perfectly O
reckless O
on O
that O
score O
, O
provided O
only O
he O
could O
enliven O
the O
dull O
routine O
of O
ordinary O
society O
. O
Marion's S-PERSON
mingled O
expression O
of O
shyness O
and O
animation O
, O
her O
light O
laughter O
and O
ardent O
feelings O
, O
were O
refreshing O
to O
a O
mind O
so O
hackneyed O
as O
his O
, O
and O
though O
he O
often O
checked O
her O
sensitive O
spirit O
in O
its O
full O
flow O
of O
affectionate O
confidence O
, O
by O
a O
retort O
courteous O
, O
or O
rather O
discourteous O
, O
he O
was O
nevertheless O
vain O
of O
the O
admiration O
she O
invariably O
excited O
, O
and O
read O
, O
in O
the O
eyes O
of O
others O
, O
the O
value O
he O
ought O
to O
place O
on O
her O
beauty O
and O
talents O
. O
Agnes' S-PERSON
whole O
mind O
was O
so O
frothed O
over O
with O
folly O
, O
and O
encrusted O
with O
selfishness O
, O
that O
unless O
the O
wheel O
of O
fortune O
touched O
upon O
her O
personal O
comforts O
, O
she O
was O
as O
impervious O
to O
all O
external O
impressions O
as O
a O
tortoise O
beneath O
the O
shell O
, O
and O
it O
was O
a O
useless O
waste O
of O
generous O
sentiments O
and O
kind O
emotions O
, O
whenever O
the O
heart O
of O
Marion S-PERSON
was O
laid O
open O
to O
her O
. O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
long O
since O
adopted O
a O
company O
manner O
, O
and O
even O
a O
company O
voice O
, O
persuaded O
herself O
that O
Marion S-PERSON
also O
had O
very O
cleverly O
" O
got O
up O
" O
a O
character O
on O
some O
imaginary O
model O
of O
excellence O
, O
which O
she O
acted O
over O
to O
the O
very O
life O
. O
It O
seemed O
to O
her O
a O
naked O
certainty O
that O
the O
refinement O
and O
delicacy O
natural O
to O
Marion's S-PERSON
mind O
were O
in O
reality O
artificial O
| | O
and O
though O
the O
radiance O
of O
her O
intellect O
, O
and O
the O
sensibility O
of O
her O
eye O
, O
were O
but O
in O
harmony O
with O
her O
actions O
, O
all O
testifying O
disinterested O
self O
- O
denial O
and O
invariable O
affection O
, O
still O
Agnes S-PERSON
convinced O
herself O
that O
Marion S-PERSON
lived O
" O
for O
effect O
. O
" O
If O
Marion S-PERSON
ever O
acted O
a O
part O
at O
all O
, O
it O
was O
only O
in O
concealing O
from O
those O
who O
might O
have O
ridiculed O
her O
, O
the O
unfathomable O
depth O
of O
her O
feelings O
, O
since O
she O
might O
as O
well O
have O
asked O
for O
sympathy O
from O
an O
ice- O
berg O
as O
from O
Agnes S-PERSON
. O
Knowing O
that O
every O
evidence O
of O
sensibility O
would O
be O
received O
with O
scepticism O
, O
she O
silently O
and O
hopefully O
waited O
till O
some O
scope O
might O
be O
afforded O
her O
for O
testifying O
that O
all O
which O
she O
might O
have O
wished O
to O
profess O
was O
nothing O
to O
what O
she O
would O
do O
or O
suffer O
for O
those O
she O
loved O
| | O
and O
if O
ever O
Marion S-PERSON
repined O
at O
any O
one S-CARDINAL
circumstance O
in O
her O
lot O
, O
it O
was O
, O
that O
she O
might O
perhaps O
pass O
through O
life O
unknown O
to O
those O
she O
loved O
the O
best O
, O
because O
she O
dared O
not O
express O
, O
even O
by O
a O
few O
insignificant O
words O
, O
that O
affectionate O
attachment O
to O
Agnes S-PERSON
and O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
, O
which O
she O
would O
have O
thought O
any O
sacrifice O
a O
pleasure O
, O
to O
evince O
in O
its O
full O
and O
heartfelt O
measure O
. O
One S-CARDINAL
privilege O
of O
friendship O
Marion S-PERSON
enjoyed O
in O
unbounded O
measure O
with O
both O
her O
brother O
and O
sister O
. O
She O
became O
the O
usual O
depositary O
of O
their O
many O
grievances O
and O
disappointments O
. O
Marion S-PERSON
had O
the O
art O
, O
— O
or O
rather O
the O
instinct O
, O
for O
to O
her O
all O
art O
was O
unknown O
, O
— O
of O
listening O
in O
perfection O
. O
If O
Agnes S-PERSON
received O
a O
dress O
from O
her O
London S-GPE
milliner O
which O
did O
not O
fit O
, O
or O
if O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
did O
not O
obtain O
an O
invitation O
to O
some O
jovial O
party O
which O
he O
had O
expected O
to O
enliven O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
became O
of O
immediate O
importance O
. O
The O
annoyance O
he O
felt O
on O
such O
occasions O
could O
scarcely O
be O
exceeded O
— O
the O
death O
of O
his O
nearest O
relation O
, O
or O
of O
all O
his O
relations O
together O
, O
would O
have O
been O
nothing O
to O
it O
| | O
but O
Marion S-PERSON
could O
always O
administer O
some O
gentle O
anodyne O
to O
the O
irritated O
sufferer O
, O
and O
displayed O
a O
wonderful O
ingenuity O
in O
turning O
up O
the O
best O
side O
of O
everything O
, O
for O
the O
advantage O
and O
comfort O
of O
others O
. O
Nothing O
melted O
Marion's S-PERSON
heart O
so O
entirely O
as O
to O
see O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
for O
a O
moment O
depressed O
, O
as O
the O
very O
pride O
and O
haughtiness O
of O
his O
spirit O
rendered O
it O
, O
in O
her O
estimation O
, O
the O
more O
affecting O
when O
he O
seemed O
at O
all O
subdued O
, O
and O
on O
the O
evening O
of O
Lady B-PERSON
Towercliffe's E-PERSON
ball O
, O
she O
could O
not O
but O
fancy O
, O
before O
he O
set O
off O
with O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
that O
there O
was O
a O
forced O
vivacity O
in O
his O
spirits O
which O
she O
had O
never O
perceived O
before O
, O
and O
that O
the O
tone O
of O
his O
voice O
had O
a O
melancholy O
modulation O
when O
he O
bid O
her O
good O
night O
, O
accompanied O
by O
an O
unusual O
degree O
of O
kindness O
, O
always O
the O
very O
worst O
indication O
of O
Sir O
Patrick's S-PERSON
spirits O
, O
the O
consciousness O
of O
which O
, O
and O
a O
thousand S-CARDINAL
conjectures O
respecting O
its O
cause O
and O
extent O
, O
dismissed O
her O
to O
bed O
with O
an O
anxious O
mind O
and O
a O
prayer O
, O
even O
more O
fervent O
than O
usual O
, O
for O
his O
happiness O
. O
In O
one S-CARDINAL
house O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
was O
understood O
and O
loved O
as O
she O
wished O
to O
be O
, O
and O
all O
her O
young O
enthusiasm O
found O
its O
best O
refuge O
and O
welcome O
in O
the O
aged O
heart O
of O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
who O
felt O
refreshed O
and O
cheered O
by O
the O
companionship O
of O
thoughts O
and O
feelings O
as O
fresh O
and O
natural O
as O
the O
flowers O
in O
spring O
, O
while O
they O
reminded O
him O
of O
the O
time O
when O
his O
own O
had O
been O
as O
buoyant O
and O
untrodden O
, O
as O
hopeful O
and O
gay O
, O
as O
full O
of O
kind O
intentions O
and O
generous O
wishes O
. O
The O
morning O
after O
Marion's S-PERSON
arrival O
at O
St. B-FAC
John's I-FAC
Lodge E-FAC
, O
she O
arose O
by O
the O
peep O
of O
the O
day O
, O
intent O
on O
surprising O
her O
uncle O
with O
a O
visit O
during O
his O
early O
breakfast O
, O
and O
gayly O
anticipating O
the O
look O
of O
joyful O
surprise O
and O
perplexity O
with O
which O
she O
would O
be O
welcomed O
, O
while O
she O
rehearsed O
in O
her O
own O
happy O
mind O
, O
how O
best O
to O
increase O
Sir O
Arthur's S-PERSON
astonishment O

day O
was O
indeed O
one O

matchless O
beauty O

exhibiting O
looks O
full O
of O
mirth O

hilarity O

and O
good O
humor O
, O
as O

hastened O
past O

the O

in O
accents O
of O
manly O
regret O

indignation O

while O
there O
was O
a O
mournful O
tenderness O
in O
the O
look O
he O
turned O
on O
his O
niece O
, O
" O
You O
have O
not O
heard O

the O
little O
I O
ever O
had O

been O
made O
less O

a O
mean O
transaction O

my O

my O

this O
matters O
little O

as O
it O

not O
in O
the O

that O
with O

has O
almost O
entirely O

general O
health O

equally O
bad O

my O
long O

" O
Marion S-PERSON
silently O
and O
tearfully O
kissed O
her O
uncle's O
check O
, O
and O
pressed O
his O
hand O
more O
closely O
in O
her O
own O
, O
while O
he O
proceeded O
, O
in O
accents O
of O
increasing O
emotion O

" O
Marion S-PERSON
clasped O
her O
arms O
round O
Sir O
Arthur's S-PERSON
neck O
, O
and O
wept O
in O
silence O
. O
There O
was O
a O
weight O
of O
grief O
in O
all O
he O
had O
said O
, O
for O
which O
she O
was O
totally O
unprepared O

which O
she O
felt O
in O
every O

Sir O

afflictions O

was O
in O
some O
degree O
prepared O

they O
seemed O
as O
nothing O

compared O
with O
what O
her O
venerable O
uncle O
said O
, O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
, O
of O
himself O
. O
He O
was O
a O
strong O
- O
minded O
man O
, O
unwilling O
to O
obtrude O
his O
infirmities O

feelings O
on O
the O
notice O
of O
any O
one O

always O
rather O

cheerfulness O
from O
those O
around O

to O
cause O
anxiety O

grief O

but O
a O
sense O
of O
its O
absolute O
necessity O
had O
induced O
him O
to O
show O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
in O
some O
degree O
, O
her O
real O
position O
, O

in O
doing O
so O

had O
obliged O
him O
for O
once O
to O
speak O
of O
his O
own O
pecuniary O
losses O
and O
growing O
frailty O

Long O
as O
the O
Admiral O
had O
been O
threatened O
with O
blindness O
, O
brought O
on O
by O
the O
pernicious O
climates O
in O
which O
he O
had O
served O
, O
the O
apprehension O
of O
actually O
losing O
him O
had O
hitherto O
been O
so O
far O
from O
Marion's S-PERSON
thoughts O
, O
that O
she O
frequently O
pleased O
herself O
with O
anticipating O
the O
time O
when O
she O
might O
herself O
supply O
, O
by O
reading O
to O
him O
and O
walking O
with O
him O
, O
the O
place O
of O
that O
gloomy O
and O
spectral O
- O
looking O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
, O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
few O
people O
in O
the O
world O
whom O
Marion S-PERSON
disliked O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
that O
she O
almost O
envied O
him O
for O
being O
so O
constantly O
in O
the O
society O
of O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
and O
for O
being O
so O
indispensably O
useful O
to O
him O
. O
Marion S-PERSON
felt O
that O
all O
the O
world O
would O
be O
cold O
and O
bleak O
to O
her O
indeed O
, O
as O
if O
the O
sun O
had O
left O
the O
firmament O
, O
if O
she O
lost O
the O
warmth O
of O
affection O
and O
kindness O
to O
which O
, O
from O
infancy O
, O
she O
had O
been O
accustomed O
, O
in O
the O
house O
of O
her O
beloved O
uncle O
, O
the O
only O
parent O
she O
had O
ever O
known O

If O
such O
a O
misfortune O
were O
to O
come O
, O
who O
would O
then O
advise O
her O
— O
who O
would O
then O
be O
interested O

her O
feelings O

believe O
in O

sincerity O

affections O

who O
would O
be O
happy O
when O
she O
appeared O
, O
and O
grieved O
when O
she O
departed O
? O
All O
this O
rushed O
upon O
Marion's S-PERSON
young O
mind O
when O
she O
arose O
to O
depart O
, O
while O
bitter O
tears O
coursed O
each O
other O
down O
her O
cheeks O
, O
and O
large O
drops O
stood O
in O
the O
nearly O
blinded O
eyes O
of O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
which O
he O
endeavored O
to O
hide O
, O
as O
he O
affectionately O
embraced O
her O
, O
saying O
, O
in O
a O
tone O
of O
dignified O
, O
but O
melancholy O
composure O
, O
" O

back O
soon O
, O

me O

earnestness O

CHAPTER O
XV O
. O
Marion's S-PERSON
walk O
back O
from O
Portobello S-FAC
was O
of O
a O
very O
different O
aspect O
from O
her O
gay O
outset O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
and O
nature O
seemed O
to O
have O
suddenly O
gone O
out O
of O
tune O
as O
she O
gazed O
around O
, O
with O
an O
altered O
eye O
on O
the O
sombre O
massy O
hills O
with O
their O
giant O
shadows O
, O
throwing O
into O
mysterious O
obscurity O
the O
tall O
ancient O
buildings O
of O
the O
doleful O
Canongate S-PERSON
, O
which O
looked O
like O
the O
ghost O
of O
a O
departed O
city O
| | O
and O
the O
melancholy O
magnificence O
of O
Holyrood S-GPE
reminded O
her O
of O
greatness O
in O
adversity O
, O
while O
she O
reflected O
that O
the O
royal O
houses O
of O
Stuart S-PERSON
and O
of O
Bourbon S-PERSON
had O
there O
found O
a O
dismal O
refuge O
in O
their O
utmost O
destitution O
. O
But O
more O
immediately O
connected O
with O
herself O
, O
and O
more O
interesting O
still O
to O
her O
thoughts O
, O
though O
rather O
a O
sinking O
in O
poetry O
, O
was O
the O
consideration O
that O
there O
her O
own O
brother O
had O
been O
driven O
by O
his O
folly O
and O
indiscretion O
, O
and O
that O
her O
father's O
family O
, O
so O
long O
respected O
in O
Scotland S-GPE
, O
seemed O
now O
about O
to O
be O
finally O
extinguished O
in O
penury O
and O
disgrace O
. O
It O
was O
a O
misfortune O
without O
remedy O
, O
for O
Marion S-PERSON
knew O
the O
limit O
of O
her O
influence O
with O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
to O
be O
less O
than O
nothing O
, O
and O
she O
believed O
that O
not O
a O
living O
being O
possessed O
more O
. O
She O
had O
never O
heard O
a O
surmise O
of O
his O
attachment O
to O
Clara S-PERSON
, O
or O
deep O
and O
unconquerable O
as O
it O
was O
, O
she O
might O
have O
entertained O
some O
hope O
that O
the O
love O
of O
virtue O
and O
goodness O
in O
others O
, O
might O
lead O
to O
a O
respect O
for O
it O
in O
himself O
, O
though O
none O
can O
doubt O
the O
melancholy O
truth O
, O
that O
, O
as O
fevers O
are O
infectious O
, O
but O
health O
is O
not O
, O
so O
moral O
evil O
is O
far O
more O
contagious O
than O
moral O
good O
. O
After O
a O
hurried O
walk O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
reached O
home O
in O
some O
trepidation O
, O
lest O
she O
might O
be O
too O
late O
to O
dress O
for O
dinner O
, O
an O
offence O
which O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
always O
visited O
with O
his O
utmost O
indignation O
| | O
but O
on O
entering O
the O
house O
, O
she O
was O
alarmed O
and O
surprised O
to O
hear O
, O
from O
the O
butler O
, O
that O
Agnes S-PERSON
had O
been O
seized O
with O
sudden O
illness O
very O
soon O
after O
her O
return O
from O
Lady B-PERSON
Towercliffe's E-PERSON
ball O
, O
and O
that O
she O
was O
unable O
to O
leave O
her O
bed O
. O
Marion S-PERSON
flew O
, O
rather O
than O
walked O
up O
stairs O
, O
and O
entered O
her O
sister's O
room O
with O
the O
most O
affectionate O
solicitude O
, O
but O
great O
was O
her O
astonishment O
to O
find O
Agnes S-PERSON
stretched O
almost O
insensible O
on O
the O
bed O
, O
and O
evidently O
in O
an O
agony O
of O
suffering O
, O
pale O
, O
cold O
, O
and O
languid O
. O
Her O
spirits O
were O
evidently O
in O
the O
lowest O
depression O
, O
and O
, O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
in O
her O
life O
, O
she O
seemed O
to O
consider O
herself O
a O
mere O
mortal O
like O
other O
people O
. O
Dixon S-PERSON
, O
in O
the O
mean O
time O
, O
watched O
over O
the O
invalid O
with O
an O
air O
of O
excessive O
, O
almost O
exaggerated O
solicitude O
, O
emitting O
a O
series O
of O
very O
ostentatious O
sighs O
, O
while O
she O
kept O
her O
place O
close O
beside O
the O
bed O
, O
so O
as O
to O
exclude O
every O
one O
else O
, O
and O
made O
eager O
signs O
to O
Marion S-PERSON
when O
she O
entered O
, O
to O
leave O
the O
room O
without O
speaking O
, O
and O
not O
approach O
her O
sister O
, O
or O
agitate O
her O
in O
any O
way O
. O
Without O
heeding O
any O
such O
signals O
, O
however O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
approached O
the O
bed O
- O
side O
with O
noiseless O
steps O
, O
and O
quietly O
assuming O
the O
place O
which O
had O
been O
occupied O
by O
Dixon S-PERSON
, O
gently O
took O
hold O
of O
Agnes' O
hand O
, O
which O
felt O
so O
cold O
and O
clammy O
, O
that O
she O
started O
with O
a O
degree O
of O
alarm O
, O
greatly O
increased O
by O
the O
sight O
of O
the O
invalid's O
altered O
aspect O
. O
" O
Have O
you O
called O
in O
a O
doctor O
? O
" O
said O
she O
, O
anxiously O
. O
" O
Surely O
Patrick S-PERSON
does O
not O
know O
how O
very O
ill O
you O
are O
, O
Agnes S-PERSON
? O
" O
" O
Dixon S-PERSON
says O
he O
thought O
nothing O
of O
it O
, O
and O
recommended O
me O
to O
put O
off O
my O
illness O
till O
after O
the O
assembly O
: O
unfeeling O
wretch O
! O
when O
I O
shall O
perhaps O
never O
recover O
. O
Since O
then O
he O
is O
gone O
hunting O
, O
" O
added O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
peevish O
look O
at O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
as O
if O
it O
were O
her O
fault O
, O
" O
and O
he O
will O
not O
return O
home O
before O
night S-TIME
! O
" O
" O
Who O
said O
Patrick S-PERSON
had O
gone O
out O
hunting O
? O
It O
is O
not O
the O
case O
. O
I O
met O
him O
in O
the O
passage O
, O
and O
he O
had O
been O
told O
you O
complained O
only O
of O
a O
slight O
nervous O
headache O
! O
" O
said O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
glancing O
at O
Dixon S-PERSON
, O
whose O
countenance O
wore O
an O
expression O
so O
sinister O
and O
peculiar O
, O
that O
Marion S-PERSON
felt O
the O
color O
rush O
to O
her O
face O
with O
surprise O
, O
but O
turned O
away O
instantly O
to O
conceal O
how O
much O
she O
had O
been O
startled O
by O
it O
, O
though O
determined O
privately O
to O
watch O
Dixon's S-PERSON
face O
more O
narrowly O
than O
before O
, O
while O
feeling O
a O
vague O
apprehension O
of O
she O
knew O
not O
what O
. O
" O
Miss O
Dunbar S-PERSON
must O
be O
kept O
quiet O
, O
" O
observed O
Dixon S-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
harsh O
sulky O
voice O
, O
" O
she O
ought O
not O
to O
speak O
. O
It O
only O
fatigues O
her O
, O
and O
she O
should O
see O
no O
one O
! O
" O
" O
Who O
ordered O
that O
? O
" O
asked O
Marion S-PERSON
with O
a O
scrutinizing O
look O
at O
the O
abigail's O
averted O
face O
. O
" O
I O
shall O
remain O
here O
, O
Dixon S-PERSON
, O
therefore O
leave O
the O
room O
yourself O
at O
present O
. O
" O
While O
she O
angrily O
and O
slowly O
prepared O
to O
obey O
this O
authoritative O
command O
, O
Agnes S-PERSON
turned O
her O
pallid O
face O
towards O
Marion S-GPE
, O
saying O
, O
in O
a O
faint O
voice O
, O
and O
with O
a O
look O
of O
extreme O
lassitude O
, O
" O
Dixon S-PERSON
says O
I O
have O
been O
in O
a O
delirium O
. O
She O
is O
probably O
right O
, O
for O
I O
could O
have O
been O
certain O
that O
when O
the O
shutters O
were O
closed O
, O
I O
heard O
a O
voice O
in O
the O
farthest O
corner O
of O
my O
room O
. O
It O
sounded O
like O
muttered O
curses O
, O
and O
a O
dark O
figure O
crossed O
the O
fire O
- O
place O
. O
Could O
it O
be O
a O
dream O
? O
I O
was O
too O
weak O
to O
move O
— O
my O
hand O
trembled O
, O
so O
that O
I O
could O
not O
reach O
the O
bell O
, O
but O
surely O
I O
heard O
a O
low O
, O
strange O
, O
unearthly O
laugh O
. O
It O
was O
horrible O
! O
but O
a O
moment O
afterwards O
Dixon S-PERSON
appeared O
, O
and O
she O
says O
I O
was O
in O
a O
deep O
sleep O
, O
evidently O
dreaming O
some O
horrible O
dream O
! O
" O
" O
It O
is O
impossible O
sometimes O
to O
distinguish O
between O
a O
dream O
and O
a O
reality O
, O
especially O
when O
we O
are O
ill O
, O
" O
said O
Marion S-PERSON
soothingly O
, O
for O
she O
was O
alarmed O
at O
the O
look O
of O
terror O
and O
perplexity O
with O
which O
Agnes S-PERSON
mentioned O
these O
circumstances O
, O
and O
privately O
determined O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
, O
to O
communicate O
on O
the O
subject O
with O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
. O
" O
I O
must O
be O
allowed O
, O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
to O
sleep O
in O
your O
room O
to O
- O
night O
. O
" O
" O
Dixon S-PERSON
maintains O
that O
this O
is O
all O
mere O
fatigue O
, O
after O
the O
excitement O
of O
Lady B-PERSON
Towercliffe's E-PERSON
, O
but O
I O
was O
never O
yet O
wearied O
with O
being O
flattered O
and O
admired O
! O
This B-TIME
morning E-TIME
, O
however O
, O
strange O
to O
say O
, O
my O
spirits O
are O
dreadfully O
depressed O
. O
Nothing O
gives O
me O
pleasure O
. O
I O
can O
scarcely O
imagine O
any O
earthly O
thing O
that O
could O
interest O
me O
. O
Though O
the O
ball O
turned O
out O
pleasanter O
than O
any O
ball O
ever O
was O
before O
, O
and O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
seemed O
, O
as O
usual O
, O
the O
most O
lover O
- O
like O
of O
men O
, O
yet O
this O
morning O
, O
if O
he O
proposed O
to O
you O
, O
or O
even O
to O
Dixon S-PERSON
, O
I O
should O
scarcely O
care O
. O
Everything O
seems O
a O
blank O
. O
I O
feel O
a O
sort O
of O
depression O
and O
horror O
not O
to O
be O
described O
or O
imagined O
. O
" O
" O
I O
desired O
you O
, O
Dixon S-PERSON
, O
to O
leave O
the O
room O

" O
exclaimed O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
astonished O
to O
perceive O
her O
still O
lurking O
about O
the O
bed O
. O
" O
Go O
instantly O
, O
" O
added O
Marion S-PERSON
in O
a O
more O
peremptory O
tone O
, O
for O
there O
was O
something O
that O
terrified O
her O
in O
the O
woman's O
look O
. O
" O
What O
do O
you O
think O
, O
my O
dear O
Agnes S-PERSON

can O
be O
the O
cause O

very O

illness O

drank O
still O

That O
good O
creature O
, O
Dixon S-PERSON
, O
brought O
me O
a O
cup O
of O
tea O
from O
her O
own O
breakfast O
, O
on O
my O
return O
home O

merely O
to O

part O
out O

window O

it O

Dixon S-PERSON
would O
be O
mortified O

" O
Marion's S-PERSON
color O
deepened O
at O
the O
tone O
of O
reproach O
in O
which O
these O
last O
words O
were O
spoken O
. O
It O
was O
impossible O
, O
she O
thought O
, O
that O
they O
could O
be O
seriously O
considered O
applicable O
to O
her O

and O
yet O
both O
the O
look O

accent O
seemed O
to O
say O
so O
, O
and O
the O
ready O
color O
flushed O
her O
cheek O
when O
she O
felt O
that O
no O
attachment O
could O
have O
equalled O
her O
own O

had O
she O
dared O
to O
express O
it O
either O
in O
word O
or O
deed O
. O
As O
Agnes S-PERSON
declined O
sending O
for O
a O
doctor O
, O
and O
seemed O
already O
better O
, O
though O
unable O
for O
more O
exertion O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
took O
up O
a O
book O
, O
and O
remained O
silently O
by O
her O
side O
, O
watching O
, O
with O
anxious O
solicitude O
, O
every O
variation O
of O
her O
countenance O
, O
and O
, O
with O
affectionate O
ingenuity O
, O
anticipating O
all O
her O
many O
wants O
, O
the O
most O
troublesome O
of O
which O
appeared O
to O
be O
a O
craving O

intolerable O
thirst O

After O
some O
time O
the O
door O
opened O
, O
and O
Dixon S-PERSON
was O
about O
to O
enter O
with O
a O
tray O
containing O
Agnes' S-PERSON
dinner O
, O
but O
on O
seeing O
Marion S-PERSON
still O
there O
, O
she O
started O
and O
seemed O
about O
hastily O
to O
withdraw O
. O
" O
Come O
in O
, O
" O
said O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
looking O
with O
astonishment O
at O
the O
abigail's O
countenance O
, O
which O
was O
flushed O
and O
inflamed O
, O
as O
if O

been O
intoxicated O

ill O

always O
likes O
her O
dinner O
alone O

Dixon S-PERSON

pertly O
. O
" O

is O
only O
a O
plain O
pudding O

keep O

Marion S-PERSON

affectionately O
turning O
to O
Agnes S-PERSON

" O
You O
may O
leave O
it O
with O
me O

Marion S-PERSON
was O
surprised O
to O
see O
the O
woman O
visibly O
change O
color O
when O
she O
said O
this O

The O
abigail O
instantly O
compressed O
her O
lips O
as O
if O
to O
prevent O
their O
quivering O
, O
fixed O
her O
wild O
glaring O
eyes O
on O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
and O
then O
gave O
an O
anxious O
glance O
at O
the O
dinner O
tray O
. O
" O
This O
pudding O
seems O
excellent O

" O
continued O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
helping O
Agnes S-PERSON

" O
but O
surely O
there O
is O
rather O
too O
much O
sugar O
scattered O
on O
the O
top O
! O
Sugar O
! O
" O
added O
Marion S-PERSON
in O
accents O
of O
astonishment O
, O
when O
she O
had O
put O
it O
to O
her O
lips O

stop O

charge O
you O
not O

exclaimed O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
hastily O
dashing O
the O
spoon O
out O
of O
her O
sister's O
hand O
, O
as O
she O
was O
raising O
it O
to O
her O
mouth O

" O

this O

" O
Bewildered O
and O
amazed O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
looked O
round O
, O
and O
beheld O
a O
dark O
scowl O
of O
rage O
and O
fear O
, O
like O
insanity O
itself O
, O
never O
afterwards O
to O
be O
forgotten O
, O
which O
disturbed O
the O
countenance O
of O
Dixon S-PERSON
for O
a O
moment O
, O
and O
then O
she O
became O
of O

livid O

unnatural O
whiteness O
, O
when O
, O
in O
a O
low O

subdued O

" O
Marion S-PERSON
trembled O
visibly O
as O

got O
up O
, O

without O
saying O

rang O
three S-CARDINAL

astonishment O

tone O

A O
stifled O
cry O
of O
astonishment O

consternation O
escaped O
from O
Marion S-PERSON
at O
these O
words O
, O

hurriedly O
exclaimed O
, O
" O

proved O
, O
indeed O
, O
to O
be O
arsenic O

Dixon S-PERSON
bought O
on O
the O
previous O
evening O

on O
the O
usual O
pretext O
of O
poisoning O
rats O

while O
Marion S-PERSON
was O
raising O
an O
alarm O

the O
culprit O
herself O
absconded O
, O
carrying O
off O
all O
Agnes' O
trinkets O

money O

she O
must O
previously O

notice O

her O
valuable O
collection O

Agnes S-PERSON
bestowed O
the O
most O
audible O
lamentations O

splendid O
locket O

in O
diamonds O
with O
her O
brother's O
hair O

her O
secret O
regrets O

the O
deepest O
for O

with O
a O
gold O
top O
set O
in O
turquoises O

Captain O

on O
the O

in O
her O
usual O
rallying O
tone O

Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
colored O
violently O
, O
and O
strode O
to O
the O
window O
in O
evident O
confusion O
, O
which O
Marion S-PERSON
could O
not O
but O
remark O
with O
astonishment O

perplexity O

Agnes S-PERSON
, O
quite O
unconscious O
of O
his O
agitation O
, O
rattled O
on O
with O
increasing O
animation O
. O
" O
I O
always O
now O
put O
my O
money O

everything O
valuable O

I O
have O
a O
perfect O
horror O

for O
certain O

" O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
had O
recourse O
now O
to O
the O
poker O

an O
inestimable O
refuge O
in O
all O
cases O
where O
the O
concealment O
of O
emotion O
is O
an O
object O
, O
as O
his O
heightened O
color O
could O
excite O
no O
reasonable O
surprise O
after O
the O
exertion O
of O
lifting O
it O
, O
and O
the O
noise O
he O
made O
afterwards O
seemed O
equivalent O
to O
a O
reply O

" O
It O
was O
, O
after O
all O

a O
most O
terrifying O
escape O

continued O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
rather O
delighted O
than O
otherwise O
by O
the O
importance O

had O
acquired O
by O
this O

up O

it O
perfectly O

her O
sister O

laughing O
, O
" O

exactly O
the O

good O

humoredly O
smiling O

probably O
, O
at O
the O
very O

have O
spoiled O
my O
teeth O

perhaps O
made O
my O
hair O

grey O

much O
malice O

Marion S-PERSON

" O

might O
easily O

off O

a O
yawn O

into O
the O

wearied O

really O
think O
two B-DATE

long O
enough O

discuss O

will O
ferret O

out O

my O
advice O

" O
Agnes S-PERSON
assumed O
a O
look O
of O
majestic O
ire O
at O
this O
very O
cavalier O
allusion O
to O
her O
adventure O

threw O
herself O
back O

her O
arm O

with O
an O
exceedingly O
ill O

used O
aspect O

heaving O
a O
succession O
of O
indignant O
sighs O
, O
which O
continued O
most O
provokingly O
unnoticed O
till O
they O
amounted O
at O
last O
almost O
to O
groans O
of O
suppressed O
anger O

taking O
up O
the O
" O

a O
tone O

careless O
indifference O

her O
lately O
discovered O
danger O

the O
particulars O

first S-ORDINAL
mentioned O

he O
turned O
as O
pale O
as O
death O

and O
asked O
with O
startling O
eagerness O
, O
for O
a O
minute O
description O
of O
the O
abigail's O
appearance O

to O
which O
he O
listened O
with O
almost O
breathless O
attention O

From O
that O
moment O
he O
became O
indefatigable O
in O
his O
efforts O
to O
trace O
out O
the O
fugitive O
, O
in O
which O
he O
seemed O
most O
truly O

heartily O
in O
earnest O
, O
writing O
advertisements O
himself O
for O
the O
newspapers O

to O
offer O
a O
reward O
for O
her O
apprehension O

hearing O
all O

her O
dress O

more O

more O
irritated O

poisoning O

circles O

the O

might O
be O
no O

punishment O

besides O
, O
I O
do O
not O
exactly O
see O
how O
poisoning O
would O
improve O
your O
own O
prospects O

either O
in O
this O
world O

In O
respect O
to O
my O
friend O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
, O
it O
is O
quite O
a O
catch O

him O

when O
something O
occurs O
that O
he O

me O
warn O

once O

Marion S-PERSON
found O
it O
more O
and O
more O
difficult O
every O
day O
, O
to O
account O
for O
the O
bitter O
, O
angry O
contempt O
with O
which O
Agnes S-PERSON
spoke O
of O
Clara B-PERSON
Granville E-PERSON
, O
her O
dislike O
to O
whom O
never O
seemed O
for O
an O
hour O
to O
lie O
dormant O
, O
as O
she O
was O
perpetually O
making O
allusions O
to O
her O
, O
which O
caused O
very O
frequent O
irritation O
between O
herself O
and O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
, O
who O
sometimes O
angrily O
left O
the O
room O
, O
and O
yet O
occasionally O
joined O
in O
her O
invectives O
against O
the O
whole O
Granville S-PERSON
family O
, O
in O
a O
tone O
of O
reckless O
, O
angry O
derision O
, O
which O
was O
to O
Marion S-PERSON
completely O
perplexing O
and O
unaccountable O
. O
If O
Agnes S-PERSON
felt O
dull O
or O
out O
of O
spirits O
, O
she O
complained O
of O
being O
excessively O
Granville O
- O
ish O

or O
if O
Sir O

were O
observed O
for O
a O
wonder O
, O
in O
any O
single O
instance O
, O
to O
economise O
, O
she O
called O
him O

if O
her O
brother O
either O
laughed O

himself O
out O

the O
humor O

was O
in O

was O
in O
a O
fit O
of O
Granville S-GPE
- O
ism O

and O
Marion S-PERSON
became O
surprised O
to O
perceive O
that O
the O
mention O
of O
that O
name O
was O
never O
, O
even O
by O
chance O
, O
like O
that O
of O

indifference O

conscious O
that O
some O
secret O
was O
connected O

it O
, O
not O
imparted O
to O
her O
, O
she O
carefully O
avoided O
all O
allusion O
to O
Clara S-PERSON
. O
Agnes S-PERSON
one B-DATE
day E-DATE
jestingly O
announced O
to O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
that O
the O
Granvilles S-PERSON
had O
taken O
out O
perpetual O
tickets O
at O
the B-ORG
Charitable I-ORG
Soup I-ORG
Kitchen E-ORG
, O
and O
meant O
to O
dine O
there O
every O
day O
on O
broth O
| | O
and O
the O
next O
morning O
she O
rather O
inconsistently O
found O
fault O
with O
them O
, O
because O
at B-CARDINAL
least I-CARDINAL
twenty E-CARDINAL
poor O
people O
assembled O
at O
their O
lodgings O
every O
day O
, O
to O
be O
fed O
, O
as O
if O
it O
were O
a B-ORG
House I-ORG
of I-ORG
Refuge E-ORG
. O
Marion S-PERSON
observed O
that O
all O
the O
innumerable O
books O
for O
charitable O
subscriptions O
, O
which O
were O
circulated O
from O
door O
to O
door O
, O
Agnes S-PERSON
liked O
to O
examine O
, O
for O
the O
gossiping O
amusement O
of O
ascertaining O
how O
much O
was O
given O
by O
each O
or O
her O
friends O
, O
though O
never O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
adding O
her O
own O
name O
, O
as O
her O
purse O
was O
a O
complete O
valetudinarian O
, O
always O
complaining O
of O
exhaustion O
, O
yet O
always O
capable O
of O
any O
exertion O
dictated O
by O
inclination O

and O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
also O
, O
though O
he O
generally O
swore O
an O
impatient O
oath O
or O
two S-CARDINAL
, O
when O
he O
saw O
the O
succession O
of O
dingy O
looking O
books O
brought O
into O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
, O
sometimes O
amused O
himself O
with O
a O
supercilious O
glance O
at O
the O
contents O

Whenever O
the O
object O
was O
judicious O
, O
the O
Reverend O
Richard B-PERSON
Granville's E-PERSON
name O
, O
and O
that O
of O
his O
sister O
, O
appeared O
for O
a O
small O
sum O
, O
such O
as O
they O
might O
be O
able O
to O
afford O
| | O
and O
Marion S-PERSON
felt O
convinced O
there O
was O
much O
single O
- O
hearted O
goodness O
, O
and O
courageous O
disregard O
of O
mere O
appearances O

pompous O

of O
Lady B-PERSON

unobtrusive O
ten B-MONEY
shillings E-MONEY
, O
or O
half O
- O
a- O
crown O
of O
Miss O
Granville S-PERSON

It O
was O
probably O
all O
Clara S-PERSON
could O
give O
, O
and O
she O
did O
not O
feel O
ashamed O
to O
proclaim O
the O
very O
small O
amount O
, O
though O
Agnes S-PERSON

most O
persons O
who O
are O
mean O
themselves O
, O
in O
respect O
to O
giving O

was O
splendid O
in O
her O
notions O
for O
others O
, O
and O
exclaimed O
outrageously O
against O
the O
absurdity O
of O
bestowing O
a O
paltry O
trifle O
at O
all O
. O
" O
Five B-MONEY
shillings E-MONEY
to O
the O
Infirmary O
! O
did O
ever O
anybody O
hear O
such O
nonsense O
! O
as O
if O
an O
Infirmary O
could O
be O
supported O
on O
five B-MONEY
shillings E-MONEY
! O
It O
is O
so O
like O
Clara B-PERSON
Granville's E-PERSON
trumpery O
ideas O
! O
I O
daresay O
she O
thought O
the O
fortune O
of O
the O
institution O
made O
by O
such O
a O
donation O
! O
It O
will O
scarcely O
buy O
a O
packet O
of O
James' S-PRODUCT

for O
one S-CARDINAL

the O
invalids O

" O
" O
But O
when O

spares O
five B-MONEY
shillings E-MONEY
, O
are O
we O
to O
give O
nothing O

asked O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
seeing O
Sir O
Patrick's S-PERSON
pompous O
butler O
, O
as O
usual O
, O
carrying O
away O
the O
book O
untouched O
. O
" O
Better O
give O
nothing O
than O
make O
ourselves O
ridiculous O
, O
like O
the O
Granvilles S-PERSON
. O
Nobody O
will O
guess O
that O
this O
book O
was O
brought O
here O
! O
I O
wish O
Clara S-PERSON
had O
given O
her O
superfluous O
money O
towards O
the O
better O
equipment O
of O
their O
own O

the O
merest O

you O
ever O
see O
anything O
so O
ugly O
, O
and O
out O
of O
taste O
, O
as O
that O
little O
yellow O

of O
the O
Granvilles' S-GPE

standing O
close O

! O
" O
An O
angry O
flush O
burned O
upon O
the O
cheek O
of O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
, O
who O
did O
not O
trust O
his O
temper O
with O
a O
reply O
to O
Agnes' S-PERSON
tirade O

and O
Marion S-PERSON
hastily O
withdrew O
her O
eyes O
from O
his O
countenance O
, O
on O
perceiving O
that O
he O
had O
bit O
his O
lip O
till O
the O
blood O
seemed O
ready O
to O
spring O
, O
while O
his O
eyes O
flashed O
fire O
. O
In O
a O
moment O
afterwards O
, O
he O
whistled O
half S-CARDINAL
a O
tune O
, O
threw O
open O
the O
window O
, O
and O
finally O
hurried O
out O
of O
the O

while O
Agnes S-PERSON
looked O
mysteriously O
at O
Marion S-GPE

said O
nothing O

the O
expression O
of O
her O
eye O
plainly O
told O
that O
something O
was O
wrong O

Sunday S-DATE

Agnes S-PERSON
made O
her O
Sundays S-DATE
literally O
a O
day O
of O
rest O

by O
remaining O
most O

kept O
her O
at O
home O

She O
had O
been O
taught O
at O
Mrs. O
Penfold's S-PERSON
, O
to O
consider O
the O
most O
superficial O
attention O
to O
religion O
, O
as O
being O
little O
short O
of O

to O
believe O
that O
the O

extreme O
of O
rational O
devotion O
, O
if O
she O
wished O
to O
be O
inordinately O
pious O
, O
would O
consist O
in O
going O
once O
every O
Sunday S-DATE
to O
a O
pew O
in O
some O
fashionable O
chapel O
, O
where O
the O
stream O
of O
the O
preacher's O
eloquence O
might O
be O
permitted O
to O
flow O
in O
at O
one O

out O

any O
occasion O

her O
to O
analyse O

understand O
what O
he O
said O

satisfied O
that O
her O
duty O
was O
more O

done O
by O
appearing O
there O
at O
all O
, O
— O
besides O
which O
, O
she O
occasionally O
read O
prayers O
at O
home O

in O
a O
careless O
mechanical O
way O
, O
which O
was O
anything O

praying O

she O
had O
a O
magnificently O
bound O
bible O
on O
her O
toilette O

more O
for O

she O
wore O
all O

the O
first S-ORDINAL

dined O

rather O
in O
sleeping O
over O

what O
Sir O

laughingly O
called O

Both O

considered O
it O
a O
matter O

thinking O
about O

give O
a O
summary O

deeply O

before O
setting O

surprised O

mortified O
to O
observe O

that O
Agnes' S-PERSON
occupation O

in O
tearing O
up O

to O
make O

a O
numerous O
collection O
of O
notes O
from O

" O
What O
can O
this O
all O
mean O
? O
" O
thought O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
in O
agitated O
perplexity O
, O
as O
she O
pursued O
her O
way O
to O
chapel O
. O
" O
It O
is O
very O
unlike O
Clara S-PERSON
to O
be O
so O
repulsive O
! O
and O
equally O
unlike O
Agnes S-PERSON
to O
be O
importunate O
! O
I O
fear O
something O
is O
greatly O
wrong O

but O
Clara S-PERSON
is O
too O
just O
and O
too O
good O
to O
mingle O
me O
in O
any O
quarrel O
of O
which O
I O
do O
not O
so O
much O
as O
know O
the O
cause O

When O
we O
meet O
I O
shall O
at O
once O
ask O
Clara S-PERSON
for O
an O
explanation O
. O
We O
must O
all O
yet O
be O
reconciled O
and O
happy O
, O
as O
in O
former O
days S-DATE
. O
" O
There O
is O
nothing O
which O
extravagant O
people O
grudge O
so O
much O
as O
paying O
for O
a O
pew O

those O

It O
is O
astonishing O

will O
stand O

week B-DATE

like O
paupers O

in O
a O
chapel O
- O
aisle O

begging O
for O
a O
seat O

rather O
than O
hire O
one O
for O
the O
season O

and O
on O
this O
occasion O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
finding O
that O
neither O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON

Agnes S-PERSON
had O
ever O
imagined O
any O
necessity O
for O
providing O
themselves O
with O
a O
local O
habitation O
of O
their O
own O
, O
followed O
a O
stream O
of O
people O
into O
chapel O
, O
and O
stood O
for O
some O
time O
near O
the O
door O
, O
in O
that O
most O
awkward O
and O
conspicuous O
of O
all O
situations O
, O
waiting O
for O
the O
chance O
of O
being O
shown O
into O
a O
seat O
by O
some O
compassionate O
pew- O
opener O
. O
The O
street O
had O
been O
crowded O
by O
a O
dense O
mass O
of O
carriages O
, O
while O
Marion S-PERSON
felt O
almost O
bewildered O
by O
the O
loud O
crash O
of O
equipages O
driving O
up O
and O
driving O
off O
, O
breaking O
the O
line O
and O
backing O
out O
, O
as O
if O
they O
had O
been O
assembled O
on O
the O
benefit O
night O
of O
some O
popular O
actor O
, O
while O
a O
flood O
of O
pedestrians O
crowded O
along O
the O
foot O
- O
path O
, O
as O
if O
their O
lives O
depended O
on O
being O
first S-ORDINAL
. O
She O
was O
astonished O
also O
at O
the O
unprecedented O
concourse O
of O
people O
already O
assembled O
in O
chapel O
, O
with O
looks O
of O
eager O
excitement O
and O
flushed O
expectation O
. O
Every O
aisle O
appeared O
filled O
to O
excess O
, O
and O
the O
staircase O
seemed O
one S-CARDINAL
solid O
mosaic O
of O
faces O
, O
while O
the O
congregation O
were O
all O
crushing O
, O
elbowing O
, O
and O
pushing O
forward O
, O
in O
impatient O
haste O
. O
Voices O
were O
heard O
, O
at O
length O
, O
speaking O
aloud O
, O
in O
angry O
contention O
, O
for O
places O
— O
a O
sound O
which O
grated O
strangely O
and O
startlingly O
on O
the O
ear O
in O
a O
sacred O
edifice O
| | O
and O
when O
at O
length O
the O
heat O
became O
unbearably O
intense O
, O
a O
loud O
crash O
was O
heard O
, O
of O
persons O
breaking O
the O
window O
for O
air O
. O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
intimidated O
at O
having O
ventured O
alone O
into O
so O
dense O
a O
crowd O
, O
and O
at O
a O
loss O
to O
guess O
what O
could O
occasion O
so O
much O
excitement O
, O
would O
have O
made O
her O
way O
out O

but O
the O
pressure O
behind O
rendered O
it O
as O
impossible O
to O
retreat O
as O
to O
advance O
. O
On O
few O
occasions O
do O
people O
betray O
so O
great O
a O
want O
of O
kind O
consideration O
, O
and O
even O
of O
hospitality O
, O
as O
when O
comfortably O
ensconced O
in O
an O
extensive O
pew O
at O
church O
, O
occupying O
room O
enough O
for O
three S-CARDINAL
or O
four S-CARDINAL
others O
, O
and O
carelessly O
staring O
at O
those O
who O
are O
vainly O
waiting O
, O
with O
hesitation O
and O
confusion O
such O
as O
Marion's S-PERSON
, O
in O
hopes O
of O
being O
obligingly O
accommodated O
with O
a O
place O
. O
Her O
color O
deepening O
every O
moment O
, O
and O
her O
veil O
drawn O
closer O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
shrank O
from O
notice O
, O
while O
one S-CARDINAL
person O
after O
another O
elbowed O
his O
way O
forward O
, O
and O
closed O
the O
door O
of O
his O
pew O
, O
with O
the O
authoritative O
, O
self O
- O
satisfied O
air O
of O
a O
proprietor O
, O
heedless O
how O
others O
might O
be O
situated O

and O
still O
Marion S-PERSON
anxiously O
glanced O
around O
her O
in O
vain O
, O
for O
the O
obscurest O
nook O
in O
which O
to O
subside O
unseen O
. O
At O
length O
, O
when O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
loud O
peal O
of O
the O
organ O
had O
sent O
forth O
its O
solemn O
tones O
, O
summoning O
every O
heart O
to O
devout O
attention O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
felt O
a O
gentle O
touch O
given O
to O
her O
arm O
, O
and O
on O
looking O
round O
, O
her O
hand O
was O
clasped O
for O
a O
moment O
with O
a O
look O
of O
heartfelt O
affection O
by O
Clara B-PERSON
Granville E-PERSON
, O
who O
silently O
led O
her O
to O
the O
seat O
, O
at O
some O
distance O
, O
from O
which O
she O
had O
followed O
her O
, O
and O
giving O
one S-CARDINAL
more O
affectionate O
pressure O
of O
the O
hand O
to O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
she O
composed O
herself O
into O
a O
look O
of O
devout O
and O
fervent O
attention O
, O
forgetful O
evidently O
of O
all O
but O
the O
important O
services O
of O
the O
hour O
, O
while O
Marion's S-PERSON
heart O
beat O
with O
rapture O
to O
find O
herself O
once O
more O
beside O
her O
most O
beloved O
friend O
, O
and O
that O
friend O
unchanged O
. O
The O
prayers O
were O
not O
merely O
read O
, O
but O
prayed O
— O
not O
in O
the O
every O
day O
matter O

of O

course O
tone O

so O
common O

with O
deep O

in O
a O
manner O
calm O

graceful O
, O

dignified O

by O
a O
young O
clergyman O
of O
most O
intelligent O

serious O
aspect O

who O
evidently O
felt O
all O

said O

became O
so O
utterly O
absorbed O
in O
his O
duty O

almost O
imagined O
himself O
alone O

visibly O
present O
with O
the B-PERSON
Divine I-PERSON
Being E-PERSON
whom O
he O
addressed O
. O
The O
young O
preacher's O
appearance O
was O
singularly O
striking O
and O
prepossessing O
. O
His O
dark O
Spanish S-LANGUAGE
- O
looking O
complexion O
, O
and O
rather O
foreign O
features O
, O
were O
animated O
by O
an O
expression O
of O
the O
brightest O
intelligence O
, O
while O
in O
his O
eye O
might O
be O
traced O
the O
calm O
dignity O
of O
a O
highly O
cultivated O
intellect O
, O
and O
the O
benevolence O
of O
a O
Christian S-NORP
who O
hoped O
all O
things O
and O
believed O
all O
things O
, O
judging O
others O
as O
he O
would O
himself O
be O
judged O
. O
In O
preaching O
, O
he O
avoided O
the O
arena O
of O
controversy O
, O
but O
his O
arguments O
were O
clear O
and O
comprehensive O
, O
his O
eloquence O
irresistible O
, O
as O
much O
by O
the O
fire O
and O
splendor O
of O
his O
genius O
, O
as O
by O
the O
depth O
and O
solemnity O
of O
his O
reflections O
, O
while O
the O
attention O
was O
enthralled O
, O
the O
judgment O
convinced O
, O
the O
heart O
awakened O
, O
and O
the O
inward O
feelings O
touched O
in O
their O
most O
secret O
recesses O
. O
Without O
a O
thought O
of O
affectation O
, O
he O
was O
simple O
, O
dignified O
, O
full O
of O
earnestness O
, O
self O
- O
conviction O
, O
and O
fervent O
devotion O
, O
while O
there O
were O
passages O
of O
grandeur O
when O
he O
alluded O
to O
the O
solemn O
mysteries O
, O
and O
higher O
truths O
of O
revelation O
, O
which O
might O
have O
made O
a O
mere O
philosopher O
feel O
as O
if O
the O
wing O
of O
his O
imagination O
had O
been O
broken O
in O
attempting O
to O
follow O
| | O
and O
yet O
there O
were O
thoughts O
and O
illustrations O
so O
clear O
and O
comprehensible O
, O
that O
any O
ignorant O
child O
from O
a O
charity O
school O
might O
have O
understood O
them O
. O
Amidst O
the O
brighter O
scintillations O
of O
his O
genius O
, O
it O
was O
evident O
that O
he O
understood O
the O
whole O
alchemy O
of O
human O
nature O
, O
and O
while O
almost O
insensibly O
revealing O
the O
magnificent O
proportions O
of O
his O
own O
mind O
, O
he O
understood O
and O
sympathised O
with O
all O
the O
trials O
, O
temptations O
, O
and O
sorrows O
of O
human O
nature O
, O
and O
considered O
the O
whole O
art O
of O
happiness O
for O
man O
to O
consist O
in O
unreserved O
and O
heartfelt O
submission O
of O
his O
own O
will O
, O
his O
own O
hopes O
, O
wishes O
, O
and O
affections O
to O
the O
will O
of O
his O
Maker S-PERSON
, O
desiring O
to O
have O
nothing O
, O
to O
be O
nothing O
, O
to O
do O
nothing O
, O
and O
to O
expect O
nothing O
, O
but O
according O
to O
His O
wise O
and O
holy O
decrees O
— O
to O
let O
the O
stream O
of O
events O
run O
on O
, O
seeking O
to O
extract O
the O
best O
happiness O
from O
them O
as O
they O
occurred O
, O
without O
one S-CARDINAL
rebellious O
wish O
that O
they O
had O
been O
otherwise O
, O
but O
only O
with O
a O
fervent O
prayer O
that O
they O
may O
, O
and O
a O
firm O
belief O
that O
they O
shall O
, O
carry O
him O
forward O
, O
though O
the O
course O
be O
rough O
and O
perilous O
, O
to O
a O
calm O
, O
bright O
haven O
of O
ceaseless O
and O
unutterable O
joy O
. O
When O
the O
congregation O
had O
dispersed O
, O
with O
a O
degree O
of O
silence O
and O
solemnity O
very O
different O
from O
their O
noisy O
and O
irreverent O
entrance O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
walked O
for O
some O
time O
, O
leaning O
on O
the O
arm O
of O
Miss O
Granville S-PERSON
, O
but O
so O
entranced O
that O
she O
was O
unable O
yet O
to O
break O
the O
chain O
which O
had O
carried O
her O
mind O
and O
feelings O
captive O
to O
another O
and O
a O
better O
world O
. O
She O
had O
never O
before O
felt O
so O
deeply O
impressed O
with O
the O
transitory O
nature O
of O
all O
around O
her O
, O
the O
insignificance O
of O
those O
joys O
and O
sorrows O
with O
which O
she O
was O
encompassed O
, O
and O
it O
seemed O
to O
her O
but O
a O
day O
or O
an O
hour O
, O
till O
the O
curtain O
of O
eternity O
should O
rise O
, O
and O
the O
glories O
of O
a O
great O
hereafter O
become O
visible O
to O
her O
sight O
. O
" O
You O
have O
been O
deeply O
interested O
by O
all O
we O
have O
heard O
? O
" O
said O
Clara S-PERSON
, O
in O
an O
accent O
of O
gentle O
interrogation O
, O
but O
with O
an O
expression O
of O
peculiar O
meaning O
in O
her O
countenance O
, O
which O
Marion S-PERSON
was O
at O
a O
loss O
how O
exactly O
to O
interpret O
. O
" O
Interested O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
with O
youthful O
enthusiasm O
. O
" O
If O
all O
the O
sermons O
I O
ever O
heard O
were O
compressed O
into O
one O
, O
they O
could O
scarcely O
equal O
what O
has O
been O
said O
to O
- O
day O
! O
" O
" O
Do O
you O
remember O
the O
preacher O
? O
" O
asked O
Clara S-PERSON
, O
coloring O
and O
smiling O
. O
" O
But O
no O
! O
how O
could O
that O
be O
possible O

when O
you O
never O
met O
before O

Here O

Allow O
me O
to O
introduce O
you O
, O
then O
, O
to O
my O
very O
dear O
brother O
Richard S-PERSON
. O
You O
know O
each O
other O
already O
, O
by O
the O
description O
of O
one O
who O
loves O
you O
both O
! O
" O
Mr. O
Granville S-PERSON
advanced O
to O
Marion S-GPE
with O
frank O
and O
prepossessing O
kindness O
, O
but O
though O
his O
manner O
was O
most O
ingratiating O
, O
his O
countenance O
wore O
an O
expression O
of O
pre-occupation O
and O
fatigue O
, O
while O
he O
walked O
hurriedly O
past O
, O
after O
cordially O
shaking O
Marion S-PERSON
by O
the O
hand O
, O
who O
observed O
to O
Clara S-PERSON
with O
surprise O
, O
that O
his O
hand O
felt O
as O
cold O
as O
ice O
. O
" O
That O
is O
always O
the O
case O
with O
Richard S-PERSON
after O
preaching O
, O
" O
replied O
Miss O
Granville S-PERSON
. O
" O
The O
solemn O
feeling O
of O
responsibility O
which O
he O
has O
on O
entering O
the O
pulpit O
, O
often O
agitates O
and O
overawes O
him O
to O
a O
degree O
you O
would O
scarcely O
credit O
. O
The O
extravagant O
enthusiasm O
with O
which O
he O
has O
lately O
been O
followed O
, O
makes O
him O
still O
more O
anxious O
to O
use O
rightly O
while O
it O
lasts O
his O
influence O
with O
others O
, O
though O
, O
as O
he O
says O
, O
nothing O
is O
so O
transient O
in O
this O
transitory O
world O
as O
the O
popularity O
of O
a O
preacher O
, O
and O
his O
chief O
solicitude O
is O
to O
remind O
men O
that O
it O
is O
the O
word O
preached O
, O
and O
not O
the O
preacher O
, O
which O
they O
are O
come O
to O
hear O
, O
and O
always O
to O
preserve O
the O
simplicity O
of O
his O
own O
mind O
, O
unadulterated O
by O
any O
inordinate O
wish O
for O
applause O
. O
" O
" O
I O
am O
sure O
his O
words O
and O
thoughts O
have O
all O
the O
force O
of O
genuine O
feeling O
, O
" O
said O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
earnestly O
. O
" O
He O
preaches O
from O
heart O
to O
heart O
, O
which O
is O
the O
only O
way O
to O
strike O
a O
light O
between O
them O
. O
It O
seemed O
to O
- O
day O
, O
as O
if O
he O
were O
steering O
us O
through O
an O
ocean O
of O
immeasurable O
thought O
. O
" O
" O
But O
, O
" O
replied O
Clara S-PERSON
, O
" O
Richard S-PERSON
is O
deeply O
impressed O
with O
the O
danger O
to O
a O
preacher O
himself O
, O
arising O
from O
the O
adulation O
with O
which O
he O
is O
followed O
by O
crowds O
in O
search O
of O
novelty O
, O
who O
give O
that O
respect O
to O
the O
mere O
ambassador O
delivering O
his O
message O
, O
which O
he O
wishes O
to O
claim O
solely O
and O
entirely O
for O
his O
Divine O
Master O
. O
He O
quoted O
to O
me O
yesterday S-DATE
a O
quaint O
old O
author O
, O
who O
says O
that O
God O
humbles O
men O
in O
this O
life O
, O
that O
He O
may O
exalt O
them O
forever O
| | O
but O
Satan S-PERSON
exalts O
men O
in O
this O
life O
, O
that O
he O
may O
cast O
them O
down O
for O
eternity O
. O
It O
is O
a O
solemn O
truth O
, O
and O
Richard S-PERSON
feels O
the O
danger O
as O
he O
ought O
. O
" O
" O
Then O
it O
is O
a O
danger O
no O
longer O
, O
if O
seen O
and O
rightly O
avoided O
, O
" O
replied O
Marion S-PERSON
. O
" O
He O
already O
lives O
, O
I O

heard O

while O
he O
acts O
in O
this O

so O

down O
your O

to O
earth O
, O
if O
he O
hears O
all O

thought O
. O
Lady O
Towercliffe S-PERSON
remarked O
, O
as O
we O
came O
out O
, O
that O
his O
eloquence O
does O
him O
immortal O
honor O

" O
" O
Yes O

Richard S-PERSON
himself O

perhaps O
a O

that O
is O
no O
object O

ambition O
to O
a O

My O
brother O
is O
blessed O
with O
one S-CARDINAL
Christian S-NORP
attainment O
almost O
in O

that O
is O
an O
actual O
dread O
of O

No O
penny O

could O
be O
more O
insignificant O
in O
his O
estimation O

the O
enthusiasm O
of O
a O
few O
excitable O
young O

frothing O
him O

as O
he O
calls O
it O

down O

no O

If O
he O
did O
not O

he O
would O

He O

hope O

doing O
good O
according O

Richard S-PERSON
says O

conscientiously O

a O

better O

CHAPTER O

. O
From O
that O
memorable O
Sunday S-DATE
when O
Marion S-PERSON
first S-ORDINAL
renewed O
her O
friendship O
and O
intimacy O
with O
Clara S-PERSON
, O
her O
fair O
young O
countenance O
brightened O
into O
its O
sunniest O
smiles O
, O
while O
day O
after O
day O
she O
carried O
her O
work O
to O
the O
little O
" O
cottage O
of O
contentment O
, O
" O
where O
Clara S-PERSON
generally O
received O
her O
in O
what O
she O
called O
her O
summer O
drawing O
- O
room O
, O
a O
small O
bowling O
- O
green O
in O
the O
garden O
, O
bright O
and O
shining O
as O
an O
emerald O
, O
beneath O
a O
grove O
of O
overhanging O
lilacs O
and O
laburnums O
. O
There O
Mr. O
Granville S-PERSON
frequently O
brought O
out O
books O
, O
which O
he O
read O
aloud O
and O
discussed O
, O
developing O
the O
lofty O
aspirations O
of O
a O
mind O
fitted O
to O
be O
high O
among O
the O
highest O
in O
learning O
and O
intellect O
, O
while O
his O
thoughts O
were O
like O
a O
well O
- O
tuned O
instrument O
, O
from O
which O
every O
chord O
sounded O
to O
the O
praise O
of O
their O
Divine O
maker O
, O
and O
his O
conversation O
was O
, O
as O
Pascal S-PERSON
said O
of O
the O
Holy O
Scriptures O
, O
even O
more O
addressed O
to O
the O
heart O
than O
to O
the O
head O
. O
When O
reading O
aloud O
, O
Mr. O
Granville S-PERSON
evinced O
so O
much O
interest O
, O
with O
so O
quick O
a O
consciousness O
of O
the O
author's O
meaning O
, O
and O
so O
true O
a O
sympathy O
in O
his O
sentiments O
, O
that O

seemed O
as O
if O
he O
must O
himself O
have O
composed O
every O
line O

and O
when O
he O
occasionally O
lent O
Marion S-PERSON
any O
volume O
that O
she O
particularly O
liked O
, O
she O
found O
his O
favorite O
passages O
marked O
, O
and O
the O
margin O
enriched O
by O
so O
many O
interesting O
notes O

that O
she O
followed O
with O
delight O
the O
course O
of O
his O
mind O
, O
while O
at O
the O
same O
time O
storing O
her O
own O
memory O
with O
high O
thoughts O
and O
refined O
sentiments O
. O
There O
was O
a O
degree O
of O
soul O
and O
spirit O
in O
the O
countenance O
of O
Mr. O
Granville S-PERSON
, O
which O
marked O
him O
as O
no O
ordinary O
man O
, O
and O
an O
indefinite O
charm O
in O
his O
grave O
and O
courteous O
manner O
, O
suited O
to O
his O
holy O
profession O
, O
and O
displaying O
the O
calmness O
and O
polish O
of O
one O
accustomed O
to O
good O
society O
. O
He O
had O
an O
energy O
of O
expression O
irresistibly O
influential O
, O
while O
illustrating O
with O
an O
eloquence O
peculiarly O
his O
own O
, O
all O
the O
highest O
and O
holiest O
principles O
which O
can O
occupy O
the O
human O
heart O
. O
His O
master O
mind O
conversed O
of O
Milton S-PERSON
, O
Spenser S-PERSON
, O
Cowper S-PERSON
, O
Montgomery S-PERSON
, O
and O
of O
all O
the O
pious O
authors O
dear O
to O
every O
lover O
of O
nature O

of O
highly O
- O
wrought O
genius O
and O
devotion O
, O
while O
the O
most O
phlegmatic O
must O
have O
been O
roused O
, O
and O
the O
most O
passionate O
become O
subdued O
, O
by O
the O
indisputable O
dominion O
of O
a O
great O
mind O
, O
for O
his O
genius O
appeared O
to O
look O
upon O
the O
trifles O
of O
existence O
with O
the O
passing O
glance O
of O
an O
eagle O
in O
its O
lofty O
ascent O
. O
Marion S-PERSON
and O
Clara S-PERSON
were O
often O
entertained O
by O
Mr. O
Granville S-PERSON
when O
he O
related O
characteristic O
anecdotes O
of O
pious O
and O
literary O
men O
with O
whom O
he O
had O
associated O
, O
enlivened O
by O
original O
remarks O
, O
shewing O
strong O
powers O
of O
observation O
, O
and O
displaying O
the O
best O
side O
of O
human O
life O
| | O
yet O
his O
wit O
and O
humor O
were O
evidently O
chastened O
and O
subdued O
by O
a O
thoughtful O
estimate O
of O
existence O
, O
and O
by O
a O
continual O
consciousness O
of O
his O
high O
vocation O
, O
while O
Marion S-PERSON
scarcely O
knew O
whether O
to O
be O
most O
astonished O
at O
the O
versatility O
of O
his O
talents O
, O
or O
at O
the O
extent O
of O
his O
information O
. O
No O
subject O
seemed O
strange O
to O
him O
, O
no O
country O
unknown O
, O
no O
science O
unstudied O
, O
no O
book O
unread O
, O
— O
while O
with O
ready O
memory O
and O
practised O
judgment O
he O
spoke O
as O
he O
thought O
, O
betraying O
no O
reserve O
or O
affectation O
: O
and O
religion O
still O
, O
like O
a O
golden O
thread O
, O
was O
to O
be O
traced O
running O
through O
his O
whole O
conversation O
. O
Marion's S-PERSON
was O
a O
heart O
which O
required O
something O
in O
those O
she O
loved O
to O
reverence O
and O
look O
up O
to O
| | O
but O
here O
she O
had O
found O
that O
in O
its O
fullest O
measure O
, O
and O
under O
the O
happiest O
auspices O
, O
among O
friends O
with O
whom O
she O
had O
never O
spent O
an B-TIME
hour E-TIME
without O
feeling O
the O
happier O
and O
the O
better O
for O
it O
. O
Now O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
she O
discovered O
that O
there O
is O
an O
aristocracy O
of O
conversation O
, O
which O
avoids O
everything O
low O
or O
mean O
in O
its O
origin O
, O
while O
a O
new O
world O
of O
ideas O
opened O
upon O
her O
, O
in O
listening O
to O
sentiments O
of O
high O
honor O
, O
and O
to O
feelings O
of O
universal O
benevolence O
. O
The O
genius O
of O
Agnes S-PERSON
for O
conversation O
lay O
only O
in O
the O
line O
of O
scandal O
, O
and O
she O
was O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
sweeping O
away O
characters O
like O
cobwebs O
, O
at O
a O
single O
stroke O
, O
by O
remarks O
full O
of O
flippancy O
, O
and O
often O
using O
her O
talents O
as O
a O
mimic O
, O
while O
with O
tricks O
almost O
amounting O
to O
buffoonery O
, O
she O
rendered O
the O
best O
and O
most O
estimable O
of O
her O
friends O
, O
though O
above O
the O
reach O
of O
censure O
, O
at O
all O
events O
ridiculous O
. O
Ill O
- O
nature O
was O
to O
her O
conversation O
what O
fuel O
is O
to O
the O
flame O

and O
Agnes S-PERSON
piqued O
herself O
on O
her O
penetration O
in O
discovering O
the O
motive O
of O
others O
for O
all O
they O
did O
, O
while O
invariably O
tracing O
it O
to O
something O
mean O
or O
contemptible O
| | O
but O
with O
Richard S-PERSON
and O
Clara S-PERSON
an O
equal O
ingenuity O
was O
shewn O
in O
tracing O
it O
to O
good O
| | O
and O
while O
in O
the O
one S-CARDINAL
house O
every O
individual O
discussed O
was O
brought O
down O
to O
the O
same O
level O
of O
absurdity O
or O
selfishness O
, O
it O
was O
cheering O
and O
gratifying O
to O
a O
heart O
like O
Marion's S-PERSON
, O
that O
at O
Mr. O
Granville's S-PERSON
, O
the O
characters O
and O
feelings O
of O
every O
one S-CARDINAL
living O
were O
respected O
and O
elevated O
. O
At O
St. B-FAC
John's I-FAC
Lodge E-FAC
, O
when O
Marion S-PERSON
heard O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
and O
Agnes S-PERSON
discuss O
their O
acquaintances O
, O
she O
could O
not O
but O
wonder O
sometimes O
where O
all O
good O
or O
commendable O
people O
had O
hid O
themselves O
, O
as O
it O
seemed O
as O
if O
they O
must O
have O
fled O
from O
the O
face O
of O
man O
, O
or O
have O
closed O
their O
hearts O
in O
disgust O
from O
all O
association O
with O
the O
mean O
and O
paltry O
world O
of O
fashion O
and O
frivolity O
| | O
but O
now O
at O
last O
she O
had O
discovered O
some O
whom O
malice O
itself O
could O
scarcely O
criticise O
| | O
and O
in O
thus O
associating O
intimately O
with O
the O
" O
excellent O
of O
the O
earth O
, O
" O
she O
felt O
an O
increasing O
ambition O
to O
resemble O
them O
. O
None O
were O
more O
fitted O
than O
Clara S-PERSON
and O
Richard S-PERSON
to O
appreciate O
the O
single O

excellence O
of O
Marion's S-PERSON

brilliant O
without O

, O
her O
heart O
generous O
without O
guile O
, O
and O
her O
thoughts O
fresh O

unsophisticated O
as O
the O

summer O

from O

not O

There O
was O
a O
tone O
of O
frank O
and O
entire O
confidence O
in O
her O
manner O
, O
which O
instantly O
gained O

into O

was O
even O
something O
that O

considered O
romantic O

a O
poetry O

led O
him O

Marion's S-PERSON

her O
intercourse O

the O

with O

increasing O
confidence O

she O
joined O

the O

on O
his O

long O
after O

ceased O

the O
attachment O

concealed O

their O
happiness O

the O
result O

no O

they O
became O
attracted O
together O
by O
that O
love O

excellence O

which O
is O
the O
only O
permanent O
source O

mutual O
attachment O

Marion's S-PERSON
mind O
had O
always O
a O
propensity O
to O
admire O
, O
and O
whether O
in O
nature O

in O
art O

she O
found O
it O
more O
congenial O
to O
her O
feelings O
ever O
to O
seek O
for O
beauties O
rather O
than O
defects O

therefore O
now O
she O
was O
delighted O

associate O
with O
one O
who O
not O
only O
appreciated O
everything O
as O
she O
did O

pointed O
out O
unexpected O
excellencies O

all O

in O

saw O
that O

the O

dignity O
is O
bestowed O
on O

our O
short O

by O
thinking O
that O
we O
are O
trained O

disciplined O
as O
a O
part O
of O
a O
mighty O
plan O

has O

systematically O
on O
from O

we O
are O
woven O

the O
existence O

an O
eternity O

joy O

of O
insufferable O

the O
state O

It O
often O
occurs O
to O
me O

a O
solemn O
reflection O

are O
, O
as O
long O
as O
we O
live O

continue O
at O
war O

our O
minds O

that O
, O
like O
fire O

water O
, O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
these O
will O
finally O
extinguish O
the O

that O
, O
when O
death O
overtakes O
us O

become O
either O
entirely O
holy O

entirely O
reprobate O

traced O
in O
the O

the O

the O

was O
visible O
, O

the O
ethereal O
transparency O

her O
alabaster O

gave O
an O
almost O
poetical O

very O
melancholy O
expression O
to O
her O
countenance O

there O
was O
a O
subdued O
tenderness O

her O
voice O

touching O

heart O

wonder O

Marion S-PERSON

composure O
of O
Clara's S-PERSON

the O
occasion O

considerable O
surprise O

when O
she O
inadvertently O
mentioned O

appearance O

Marion S-PERSON
could O
not O

silently O
blame O
her O
own O
forgetfulness O
of O
her O
brother's O
conduct O
to O
Mr. O

mentioned O

seemed O
more B-CARDINAL

enter O

had O
suddenly O
burst O
away O
in O
a O
most O
unaccountable O
paroxysm O
, O
and O
hurried O
out O
of O
sight O

A O
deep O
and O
sudden O
blush O
overspread O
the O
pale O
cheek O
of O
Miss O
Granville S-PERSON

hastily O
looked O
up O
, O

color O
rushed O
in O
torrents O
over O

neck O

her O
long O
eye O

heavy O
with O
tears O

her O
emotion O
growing O
evidently O
uncontrollable O

she O
threw O
down O

all O

worth O

her O
secret O

increasing O
consciousness O

the O
wide O
disparity O

nothing O

The O
Christian S-NORP
friendship O
of O
a O
brother O
and O
sister O
for O
each O
other O
, O
is O
perhaps O
the O
purest O
and O
happiest O
of O
all O
earthly O
attachments O
, O
for O
there O
is O
not O
an O
hour O
of O
life O
from O
childhood O
to O
old O
age O
, O
in O
which O
they O
have O
not O
experienced O
the O
same O
joys O

the O
same O
sorrows O
, O
known O
every O
vicissitude O
of O
existence O
together O

acquired O
the O

wept O
for O
the O

rejoiced O
in O
the O

cherished O
the O

The O
affection O
of O
Clara S-PERSON
and O
Richard S-PERSON
was O
not O
the O
transient O
union O
of O
two S-CARDINAL
individuals O
thrown O
together O
by O
the O
accident O
of O
birth O
, O
united O
by O
mere O
instinct O
, O
living O
in O
contact O
for O
convenience O
, O
and O
expecting O
to O
be O
finally O
separated O
by O
death O

but O
it O
was O
the O
deep O
, O
strong O
, O
heart O
- O
felt O
attachment O
of O
a O
Christian S-NORP
family O
, O
linked O
together O
for O
mutual O
support O
in O
sunshine O
or O
shadow O
, O
tenderly O
to O
assist O
each O
other O
along O
the O
difficult O
path O
of O
life O
, O
happy O
in O
the O
blessings O
that O
were O
given O
them O
now O
, O
and O
happier O
still O
in O
the O
expectation O
of O
those O
yet O
to O
come O
in O
that O
" O
new O
heaven O
and O
new O
earth O
, O
wherein O
dwelleth O
righteousness O

" O
As O
Mr. O
Granville's S-PERSON
character O
became O
more O
known O
to O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
and O
the O
interest O
with O
which O
he O
listened O
to O
her O
thoughts O
and O
feelings O
perceptibly O
increased O
, O
she O
could O
not O
but O
secretly O
indulge O
sometimes O
in O
the O
thought O
, O
presumptuous O
though O
it O
seemed O
to O
herself O
, O
how O
different O
life O
might O
yet O
become O
, O
if O
the O
preference O
already O
so O
obviously O
testified O
were O
by O
any O
" O
strange O
impossibility O
" O
to O
increase O
, O
till O
he O
became O
allied O
, O
to O
her O
by O
the O
strictest O
tie O
of O
perpetual O
friendship O
, O
and O
their O
lives O
and O
affections O
were O
mingled O
into O
one O
. O
Marion's S-PERSON
young O
heart O
glowed O
with O
emotion O
when O
she O
thought O
how O
her O
feelings O
would O
all O
then O
be O
understood O
, O
her O
affections O
appreciated O
, O
her O
happiness O
cared O
for O
, O
and O
every O
trivial O
incident O
of O
her O
life O
rendered O
doubly O
important O
, O
because O
it O
belonged O
to O
another O
as O
well O
as O
to O
herself O
— O
to O
one O
who O
would O
share O
all O
her O
thoughts O
, O
direct O
all O
her O
actions O
, O
and O
mingle O
with O
every O
Christian S-NORP
motive O
to O
exertion O
, O
the O
desire O
to O
please O
him O
in O
her O
own O
happy O
home O
. O
The O
attachment O
of O
Agnes S-PERSON
for O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
was O
like O
that O
of O
a O
child O
for O
its O
rattle O
, O
compared O
with O
the O
ennobling O
sentiment O
of O
which O
Marion's S-PERSON
heart O
was O
capable O
, O
for O
there O
a O
mine O
of O
undiscovered O
affections O
lay O
buried O
and O
unknown O
, O
while O
every O
deeper O
emotion O
had O
hitherto O
been O
repelled O
or O
neglected O
by O
all O
around O
, O
except O
her O
uncle O
, O
and O
she O
could O
not O
but O
tremble O
to O
think O
, O
if O
her O
affections O
were O
ever O
warmed O
into O
life O
by O
reciprocal O
attachment O
, O
how O
inconceivable O
must O
be O
the O
misery O
or O
the O
happiness O
which O
would O
ensue O
. O
She O
indulged O
in O
no O
fallacious O
expectations O
of O
life O
, O
no O
romantic O
dreams O
of O
never O

ending O
happiness O
and O
never O
- O
dying O
love O
, O
which O
originate O
in O
unreasonable O
expectation O
, O
and O
too O
certainly O
end O
in O
bitter O
disappointment O

but O
, O
to O
be O
the O
object O
of O
Mr. O
Granville's S-PERSON
unchangeable O
confidence O
and O
affection O
, O
his O
companion O
in O
sickness O
as O
much O
as O
in O
health O
, O
the O
sharer O
of O
his O
sorrows O
as O
well O
as O
his O
joys O
, O
a O
participator O
in O
all O
his O
duties O
, O
and O
, O
most O
of O
all O
, O
to O
testify O
her O
gratitude O
for O
his O
preference O
, O
by O
devoted O
attachment O
on O
her O
own O
part O
, O
not O
bounded O
within O
the O
perishable O
limits O
of O
a O
mere O
earthly O
tie O
— O
these O
were O
the O
silent O
, O
unspoken O
wishes O
of O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
which O
glanced O
through O
her O
mind O
often O
, O
as O
she O
hurried O
home O
, O
late O
and O
unwillingly O
, O
to O
St. B-FAC
John's I-FAC
Lodge E-FAC
, O
and O
which O
caused O
her O
bright O
eye O
to O
beam O
with O
additional O
lustre O
, O
or O
brought O
the O
color O
in O
a O
richer O
carnation O
to O
her O
cheek O
. O
Events O
always O
happen O
when O
least O
expected O
, O
and O
if O
there O
be O
a O
day O
in O
life O
when O
any O
one O
in O
this O
world O
of O
change O
can O
feel O
peculiarly O
certain O
that O
nothing O
remarkable O
shall O
occur O
, O
that O
is O
probably O
the O
period O
when O
the O
most O
remarkable O
events O
take O
place O
. O
Marion S-PERSON
had O
gone O
with O
Clara S-PERSON
and O
her O
brother O
to O
spend O
a O
quiet O
day O
among O
the O
romantic O
glens O
of O
Roslin S-PERSON
, O
when O
, O
finding O
herself O
alone O
with O
Mr. O
Granville S-PERSON
, O
in O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
most O
beautiful O
parts O
of O
the O
rocky O
glen O
, O
she O
was O
suddenly O
astonished O
by O
his O
making O
her O
, O
with O
manly O
frankness O
, O
and O
yet O
evident O
diffidence O
, O
an O
explicit O
declaration O
of O
his O
attachment O
. O
He O
said O
, O
on O
the O
occasion O
, O
all O
that O
could O
be O
said O
by O
such O
a O
man O
, O
with O
the O
eloquence O
of O
deep O
emotion O
| | O
and O
, O
encouraged O
by O
the O
timid O
pleasure O
with O
which O
Marion S-PERSON
evidently O
listened O
to O
his O
words O
, O
Mr. O
Granville S-PERSON
laid O
open O
the O
whole O
depths O
of O
a O
heart O
in O
which O
all O
that O
was O
ennobling O
in O
nature O
had O
become O
embellished O
by O
all O
the O
purifying O
influences O
of O
religion O
, O
while O
she O
, O
with O
tears O
and O
blushes O
, O
heard O
thus O
unexpectedly O
what O
promised O
her O
the O
utmost O
sum O
of O
human O
felicity O
, O
and O
she O
attempted O
not O
to O
conceal O
how O
highly O
, O
beyond O
all O
expression O
, O
she O
appreciated O
his O
preference O
and O
attachment O
. O
There O
is O
a O
language O
of O
the O
heart O
which O
words O
cannot O
express O
, O
— O
thoughts O
, O
feelings O
, O
and O
affections O
too O
deep O
to O
be O
told O
, O
but O
revealed O
only O
in O
the O
eyes O
and O
voice O
, O
when O
with O
sincerity O
of O
emotion O
, O
such O
as O
Mr. O
Granville's S-PERSON
, O
a O
long O
concealed O
attachment O
is O
at O
last O
declared O
. O
" O
I O
have O
asked O
myself O
a O
thousand O
times O
whether O
I O
could O
make O
you O
happy O
, O
and O
if O
I O
believed O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
" O
that O
there O
lived O
a O
man O
upon O
the O
earth O
who O
could O
love O
you O
more O
, O
or O
make O
you O
happier O
than O
myself O
, O
I O
would O
endeavor O
to O
resign O
all O
hope O
| | O
but O
I O
know O
the O
lasting O
nature O
of O
my O
attachment O
, O
which O
time O
itself O
cannot O
alter O
, O
nor O
death O
finally O
extinguish O

and O
if O
such O
affection O
as O
mine O
, O
with O
nothing O
else O
to O
offer O
, O
can O
make O
you O
happy O
, O
it O
will O
be O
a O
new O
motive O
to O
exertion O
on O
my O
part O
, O
and O
a O
new O
source O
of O
thankfulness O
to O
the O
Divine O
Giver O
of O
all O
good O
. O
Your O
brother O
knows O
better O
than O
most O
men O
the O
pecuniary O
embarrassment O
in O
which O
a O
long O
- O
continued O
law O
- O
suit O
has O
plunged O
me O
, O
and O
that O
my O
future O
income O
may O
not O
perhaps O
be O
large O
, O
but O
consult O
him O
, O
— O
and O
my O
very O
dear O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
as O
I O
must O
for O
once O
be O
allowed O
to O
call O
you O
, O
consult O
your O
own O
wishes O
and O
your O
happiness O
. O
Before O
giving O
me O
a O
final O
answer O
, O
take O
some O
days O
to O
consider O
— O
— O
" O
" O
Not O
an O
hour O
, O
— O
or O
a O
moment O
, O
" O
replied O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
frankly O
, O
but O
with O
a O
faltering O
voice O
and O
glistening O
eye O
, O
while O
a O
vivid O
blush O
dyed O
her O
cheek O
, O
" O
I O
need O
only O
consider O
whether O
my O
own O
heart O
be O
worthy O
of O
you O
! O
I O
have O
thought O
sometimes O
, O
— O
I O
have O
dreamed O
of O
such O
happiness O
as O
ours O
shall O
be O
, O
but O
little O
did O
I O
hope O
ever O
to O
see O
it O
more O
than O
realized O
now O
! O
" O
Love O
is O
with O
lovers O
an O
endless O
subject O
, O
and O
hours O
appeared O
like O
moments O
, O
while O
they O
conversed O
together O
on O
the O
past O

the O
future O

new O
feelings O

confidence O

joy O

the O
whole O
beautiful O
scenery O

haunted O
by O
the O
spirit O
of O
thought O

of O
enjoyment O

while O
it O
was O
with O
a O
thrilling O
emotion O
of O
deep O
gratification O
that O
Marion S-PERSON
now O
felt O
undoubtingly O
conscious O
that O
she O
had O
become O
indeed O
an O
object O
of O
preference O

Mr. O
Granville S-PERSON

would O
be O

by O
one O

could O
never O

that O
these O
were O
devoted O

ardently O
devoted O
to O
herself O

now O
resolutely O
discarding O
every O
apprehension O
of O
future O
difficulties O

sorrows O
, O
all O
around O
took O
the O
color O
of O
her O
happiness O
, O
and O
she O
lived O
only O
in O
the O
joy O
of O
the B-TIME
present I-TIME
hour E-TIME
. O
Nothing O
required O
concealment O
between O
them O

seemed O
the O
sole O
object O

open O
up O

most O
secret O
recesses O

their O
minds O

comparing O
opinions O

while O
before O
long O
it O
appeared O
strange O
to O
Marion S-PERSON
that O
a O
time O
had O
ever O
existed O
when O
their O
hearts O
were O
unknown O

No O
caprices O

no O
misunderstandings O

no O
jealousies O

arise O
between O
them O

for O
there O
seemed O
to O
be O
but O
one S-CARDINAL
heart O

one S-CARDINAL
mind O
in O
common O
, O
from O
the O
moment O
when O
Marion S-PERSON
whispered O
her O
confession O
, O
that O
their O
attachment O
was O
reciprocal O

Oh O
! O
there O
are O
looks O

tones O
that O
dart O
, O
An O
instant O
sunshine O
through O
the O
heart O
, O
As O
if O
the O
soul O
that O
minute O
caught O
, O
Some O
treasure O
it O
through O
life O
had O
sought O
. O
At O
length O
they O
were O
warned O
to O
return O
homewards O
, O
by O
the O
golden O
light O
of O
a O
setting O
sun O
, O
which O
yet O
looked O
in O
glowing O
majesty O
over O
the O
distant O
hills O
, O
and O
sprinkled O
its O
glory O
on O
the O
highest O
tops O
of O
the O
trees O
, O
till O
they O
were O
tipped O
with O
fire O

but O
Marion S-PERSON
paused O
, O
in O
delighted O
admiration O
, O
on O
the O
centre O
of O
a O
rustic O
fairy O
- O
bridge O
, O
like O
a O
spider's O
web O
, O
thrown O
across O
the O
narrowest O
and O
deepest O
part O
of O
the O
swollen O
stream O
. O
Among O
rock O
and O
moss O
, O
tufted O
with O
weeping O
birch O
, O
the O
overhanging O
cliffs O
here O
formed O
themselves O
into O
two S-CARDINAL
sides O
of O
a O
natural O
arch O
, O
in O
which O
nature O
had O
apparently O
omitted O
the O
key O
- O
stone O
, O
though O
art O
had O
supplied O
the O
deficiency O
, O
by O
a O
slight O
bridge O
, O
underneath O
which O
the O
sparkling O
waters O

travelled O
into O

Marion S-PERSON
compared O

" O
It O

a O
pleasure O
to O

" O
said O
Marion S-PERSON
with O
animation O
, O
" O
that O
the O
poorest O

enjoy O
the O
beauties O

we O
do O
now O

all O
the O
pleasures O

too O
, O
of O
confidence O

, O
if O
they O

knew O
how O

value O
them O

gives O
all O
that O
is O
most O
precious O
to O
his O
creatures O
in O
common O

and O
how O
little O
of O
our O
real O
happiness O
in O
life O
is O
derived O
from O
the O
mere O
vulgar O
display O
of O
wealth O
, O

not O
the O

" O
" O
I O

answered O
Mr. O

, O
" O
that O

the O
real O
elixir O
of O

" O
replied O
Mr. O
Granville S-PERSON
. O
" O
It O
is O
by O
closing O

us O

in O

scene O

who O

wish O
for O
more O
? O
" O
said O
Marion S-PERSON

" O

" O
No O
one O

measure O
the O
depth O
of O
that O
love O

has O
placed O
us O

us O
, O

were O
finally O
to O
perish O
at O
death O
, O
we O
have O
cause O
to O
be O
thankful O
for O
seeing O
so O
much O
natural O
beauty O

so O
much O
intellectual O

remain O
here O

" O
" O
Yes O

replied O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
" O
considering O
that O
we O
have O
forfeited O

I O
think O
any O
man O

has O
enjoyed O

might O
give O
a O

" O

The O

delighted O

so O
soothing O

Mr. O

suddenly O

by O
observing O
a O
young O
lady O
approach O
with O
agitated O
and O
disordered O
steps O
, O
leaning O
on O
the O
arm O
of O
a O
more O
elderly O
female O
, O
and O
walking O
at O
a O
pace O
of O
such O
unusual O
rapidity O
, O
that O
it O
almost O
amounted O
to O
running O
. O
They O
both O
glanced O
frequently O

hurriedly O
behind O

as O
if O
under O
great O
alarm O
, O
while O
so O
remarkable O
an O
expression O
of O
terror O
was O
evident O
in O
all O
their O
looks O

movements O

that O
Mr. O
Granville S-PERSON
, O
without O
a O
moment's O
hesitation O
, O
stepped O
forward O
, O

courteously O
volunteered O
his O
services O

Marion S-PERSON
with O
delighted O
astonishment O

recognised O
her O

Mr. O

glanced O
swiftly O
round O

observed O

with O
surprise O
, O
not O
far O
from O
the O
bridge O

turning O
the O
sharp O
corner O

a O
projecting O
rock O
, O
the O
figure O
of O
a O
tall O
, O
powerful O
young O
man O
, O
of O
rather O
gentleman O
- O
like O
appearance O
, O
wrapped O
up O
to O
the O
chin O
in O
a O
large O
cloak O
, O
who O
instantly O
, O
on O
perceiving O
strangers O
, O
muffled O
his O
face O
closely O
in O
his O
handkerchief O
, O

drew O
down O
his O
hat O
, O

approached O
with O
rapid O
strides O

violent O
gesticulations O
, O
apparently O
speaking O
to O
himself O
, O

muttering O
curses O

terrifying O
vehemence O

a O
moment O
was O
lost O

hesitation O

Marion S-PERSON

the O
elder O
lady O

supporting O
Caroline S-PERSON
onwards O

who O
evidently O
suffered O
under O
a O
mortal O
terror O
, O
while O
they O
rapidly O
dragged O
her O
across O
the O
fragile O
bridge O
, O
on O
which O
Marion S-PERSON
and O
Richard S-PERSON
had O
so O
lately O
enjoyed O
some O
brief O
and O
happy O
moments O
. O
Mr. O
Granville S-PERSON
, O
in O
the O
mean O
time O
, O
approached O
the O
stranger O
so O
as O
to O
stand O
directly O
in O
his O
path O
, O
and O
necessarily O
to O
impede O
his O
progress O
, O
while O
he O
steadily O
fixed O
his O
gaze O
upon O
the O
blazing O
eye O
of O
the O
madman O
with O
a O
calm O
and O
commanding O
look O
, O
which O
testified O
an O
unflinching O
determination O
to O
obstruct O
his O
onward O
career O
, O
and O
a O
steady O
resolution O
not O
to O
be O
intimidated O
by O
the O
air O
of O
scowling O
defiance O
with O
which O
he O
was O
met O
. O
" O
Stand O
back O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
the O
stranger O
, O
in O
a O
tone O
of O
maniacal O
fury O
. O
" O

catching O
hold O
of O
the O
madman's O
arm O
when O
he O
was O
rushing O
past O
, O
and O
instantly O
stooping O
down O
as O
if O
to O
examine O
the O
foundation O
, O
when O
, O
by O
a O
powerful O
effort O
of O
strength O
, O
he O
suddenly O
hurled O
the O
whole O
fabric O
into O
the O
eddying O
stream O
, O
which O
washed O
the O
shattered O
fragments O
in O
a O
moment O
out O
of O
sight O
. O
With O
a O
cry O
of O
almost O
fiendish O
rage O
, O
and O
setting O
his O
teeth O
till O
it O
seemed O
as O
if O
they O
would O
be O
ground O
to O
powder O
, O
the O
maniac O
sprang O
like O
a O
tiger O
on O
Mr. O
Granville S-PERSON
, O
and O
would O
have O
collared O
him O
| | O
but O
with O
great O
agility O
he O
eluded O
the O
madman's O
grasp O
, O
and O
fixed O
his O
eyes O
with O
an O
expression O
of O
stern O
resolution O
upon O
his O
frantic O
antagonist O
, O
till O
his O
face O
cowered O
beneath O
that O
steady O
gaze O
, O
when O
he O
said O
in O
a O
calm O
, O
slow O
, O
resolute O
accent O
, O
" O
Those O
ladies O
shall O
pass O
on O
unmolested O
. O
It O
is O
base O
and O
cowardly O
to O
terrify O
timid O
females O
whom O
we O
are O
bound O
with O
our O
very O
lives O
to O
protect O
. O
Go O
back O
as O
you O
came O
, O
and O
beware O
of O
touching O
them O
or O
me O
. O
" O
A O
wild O
and O
hideous O
laugh O
was O
the O
maniac's O
only O
reply O
, O
and O
his O
eyes O
gleamed O
more O
and O
more O
fiercely O
, O
while O
he O
gnawed O
his O
lip O
with O
rage O
, O
but O
at O
length O
suddenly O
bursting O
with O
irresistible O
fury O
past O
Mr. O
Granville S-PERSON
, O
he O
took O
a O
long O
, O
quick O
run O
to O
where O
the O
bridge O
had O
formerly O
stood O
, O
and O
instantly O
, O
with O
a O
single O
bound O
of O
marvellous O
agility O
, O
leaped O
across O
. O
Richard B-PERSON
Granville E-PERSON
was O
for O
half O
a O
moment O
bewildered O
with O
astonishment O
at O
this O
unexpected O
achievement O
, O
and O
saw O
with O
consternation O
and O
dismay O
that O
it O
would O
be O
vain O
to O
attempt O
impeding O
the O
infuriated O
maniac O
, O
who O
turned O
a O
deaf O
ear O
to O
his O
loudly O
vociferated O
remonstrance O
, O
and O
deliberately O
fired O
a O
pistol O
in O
the O
air O
, O
while O
he O
held O
up O
another O
in O
a O
menacing O
attitude O
towards O
Mr. O
Granville S-PERSON
, O
and O
then O
replacing O
the O
deadly O
weapon O
in O
his O
breast O
, O
he O
hastily O
disappeared O
along O
the O
same O
path O
which O
had O
been O
so O
recently O
pursued O
by O
the O
ladies O
. O
Richard S-PERSON
, O
heedless O
of O
any O
danger O
to O
himself O
, O
became O
now O
most O
seriously O
alarmed O
for O
the O
safety O
of O
Marion S-PERSON
and O
her O
companions O
, O
therefore O
he O
delayed O
not O
an O
instant O
to O
scramble O
across O
the O
stream O
where O
it O
was O
fordable O
, O
and O
to O
follow O
at O
his O
utmost O
speed O
. O
In O
the O
impetuosity O
of O
Mr. O
Granville's S-PERSON
career O
, O
the O
ground O
receded O
beneath O
his O
feet O
, O
and O
as O
he O
rushed O
onward O
a O
band O
of O
iron O
seemed O
to O
restrain O
his O
breath O
, O
for O
the O
road O
became O
steeper O
and O
more O
solitary O
, O
while O
long O
grass O
and O
weeds O
had O
grown O
over O
the O
wheel O
tracks O
, O
and O
the O
way O
was O
impeded O
by O
wild O
straggling O
hedges O
, O
which O
threw O
their O
sprays O
of O
brier O
and O
thorn O
almost O
entirely O
across O
the O
way O
. O
At O
length O
meeting O
a O
couple O
of O
countrymen O
, O
he O
hurriedly O
explained O
his O
apprehensions O
, O
when O
they O
mentioned O
having O
met O
a O
strange O
, O
wild O
- O
looking O
man O
, O
proceeding O
with O
long O
strides O
in O
an O
opposite O
direction O
. O
To O
Mr. O
Granville's S-PERSON
great O
relief O
, O
however O
, O
they O
seemed O
to O
think O
that O
no O
ladies O
could O
have O
gone O
in O
that O
way O
, O
and O
after O
prevailing O
on O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
laborers O
, O
with O
a O
bribe O
, O
to O
assist O
him O
in O
capturing O
the O
maniac O
, O
he O
resolutely O
and O
fearlessly O
pursued O
his O
course O
. O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
meantime O
, O
had O
accompanied O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
ladies O
in O
their O
most O
unexpected O
flight O
through O
the O
forest O
, O
at O
a O
pace O
which O
precluded O
the O
possibility O
of O
speaking O
, O
except O
that O
now O
and O
then O
an O
ejaculation O
of O
terror O
, O
or O
an O
expression O
of O
fervent O
thankfulness O
was O
wrung O
from O
them O
when O
they O
glanced O
around O
, O
giving O
a O
fearful O
idea O
of O
instant O
danger O
. O
Caroline's S-PERSON
pallid O
lips O
were O
parted O
, O
her O
eyes O
straining O
forward O
with O
impatient O
apprehension O
, O
and O
every O
limb O
nerved O
for O
exertion O
, O
while O
she O
silently O
pursued O
her O
way O
, O
though O
her O
feet O
seemed O
to O
herself O
as O
if O
they O
had O
become O
lead O
, O
in O
her O
vehement O
efforts O
to O
fly O
onwards O
| | O
and O
the O
countenance O
of O
her O
aunt O
expressed O
scarcely O
less O
terror O
. O
Without O
speaking O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
did O
all O
in O
her O
power O
to O
accelerate O
their O
progress O
, O
but O
at O
length O
Caroline's S-PERSON
footsteps O
faltered O
, O
her O
eye O
became O
dim O
, O
and O
she O
staggered O
back O
, O
faint O
with O
fatigue O
, O
seeing O
which O
Marion S-PERSON
silently O
pointed O
to O
a O
large O
empty O
barn O
which O
stood O
beside O
the O
road O
, O
and O
having O
supported O
her O
within O
the O
door O
, O
Caroline S-PERSON
fell O
helplessly O
on O
the O
floor O
, O
covering O
her O
face O
with O
her O
hands O
, O
and O
trembling O
visibly O
in O
every O
limb O
. O
Marion S-PERSON
brought O
water O
, O
rubbed O
Caroline's O
temples O
, O
and O
tried O
by O
every O
means O
to O
soothe O
her O
with O
the O
hope O
of O
being O
safe O
, O
but O
in O
vain O
— O
her O
tongue O
grew O
parched O
, O
her O
eyes O
became O
glassy O
, O
her O
features O
almost O
livid O
, O
and O
she O
faintly O
pointed O
towards O
the O
door O
, O
which O
Marion S-PERSON
barricaded O
to O
the O
best O
of O
her O
ability O
. O
Caroline S-PERSON
threw O
herself O
back O
on O
a O
heap O
of O
straw O
, O
and O
covered O
her O
face O
with O
her O
hands O
in O
a O
helpless O
agony O
of O
fear O
. O
Several B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
afterwards O
elapsed O
in O
breathless O
silence O
on O
the O
part O
of O
Marion S-PERSON
and O
Mrs. O
Smythe S-PERSON
, O
when O
Caroline S-PERSON
at O
length O
started O
up O
, O
eager O
to O
pursue O
her O
course O
towards O
the O
nearest O
village O
, O
now O
scarcely O
a O
mile O
off O
, O
while O
her O
companions O
earnestly O
entreated O
her O
to O
rest O
rather O
, O
and O
compose O
herself O
. O
" O
He O
has O
lost O
the O
track O
! O
he O
cannot O
be O
following O
us O
now O
, O
" O
said O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
in O
accents O
of O
trembling O
alarm O
, O
the O
agitated O
tone O
of O
which O
belied O
her O
words O
, O
while O
an O
icy O
chill O
had O
crept O
through O
her O
veins O
. O
" O
Let O
us O
rest O
here O
, O
we O
are O
safe O
now O
! O
He O
will O
hurry O
past O
! O
He O
will O
not O
think O
of O
searching O
for O
us O
in O
this O
place O
! O
" O
" O
He O
will O
! O
he O
will O
! O
when O
the O
fit O
is O
on O
nothing O
escapes O
him O
, O
" O
replied O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
who O
felt O
a O
choking O
sensation O
in O
her O
throat O
which O
impeded O
her O
utterance O
. O
" O
Oh O
! O
think O
of O
the O
fearful O
past O
! O
that O
dreadful O
night O
when O
he O
first S-ORDINAL
became O
insane O
! O
Why O
did O
I O
believe O
him O
when O
he O
promised O
never O
to O
terrify O
me O
more O
! O
a O
horrid O
dread O
is O
upon O
me O
! O
a O
strange O
ringing O
in O
my O
ears O
! O
a O
weight O
of O
lead O
upon O
my O
heart O
! O
" O
" O
How O
wonderful O
that O
he O
never O
can O
be O
traced O
! O
that O
he O
always O
finds O
us O
out O
! O
that O
if O
there O
ever O
be O
a O
moment O
when O
we O
feel O
peculiarly O
safe O
from O
his O
presence O
, O
he O
comes O
! O
" O
whispered O
Mrs. O
Smythe S-PERSON
, O
in O
an O
under O
tone O
, O
as O
if O
afraid O
that O
the O
very O
walls O
might O
re-echo O
her O
words O
. O
" O
We O
must O
leave O
this O
neighborhood O
, O
we O
must O
take O
new O
precautions O
till O
he O
can O
be O
found O
and O
shut O
up O
. O
" O
Before O
Caroline S-PERSON
could O
utter O
the O
affirmative O
, O
which O
trembled O
on O
her O
lips O
, O
her O
eyes O
became O
stony O
with O
a O
look O
of O
sudden O
fear O
, O
her O
hands O
were O
faintly O
clasped O
together O
, O
her O
parched O
and O
livid O
lips O
were O
parted O
, O
and O
with O
a O
half O
uttered O
shriek O
she O
threw O
herself O
behind O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
riveting O
her O
arms O
closely O
round O
her O
waist O
, O
when O
, O
the O
next O
minute O
, O
a O
window O
of O
the O
barn O
was O
dashed O
in O
with O
a O
violence O
which O
nothing O
could O
resist O
, O
and O
the O
maniac O
, O
giving O
a O
wild O
cry O
of O
malignant O
triumph O
, O
began O
to O
clamber O
in O
, O
clinging O
to O
the O
window O
- O
sill O
with O
his O
long O
bony O
fingers O
, O
while O
concealing O
his O
face O
, O
so O
that O
nothing O
could O
be O
seen O
but O
his O
eyes O
, O
which O
burned O
like O
living O
coals O
. O
" O

have O
deceived O
me O
once O
, O

" O
said O
he O
, O
in O
hoarse O
, O
deep O
accents O
, O
and O
with O
a O
ghastly O
look O
, O
while O
the O
terrified O
girl O
seemed O
to O
wither O
beneath O
his O
glance O
. O

" O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
conscious O
that O
the O
madman's O
fury O
was O
not O
directed O
at O
herself O
, O
and O
feeling O
the O
courage O
which O
arises O
from O
desperation O

off O

terror O

gazed O
for O
an O

Marion S-PERSON
heard O
a O
sound O
of O
terror O
close O

as O

pistol O

cocked O

the O
muzzle O

was O
directed O
towards O

the O

his O
aim O

impulse O

struck O

instantly O
went O
off O

blinded O
by O
the O
shock O

Marion S-PERSON
staggered O
backwards O

strained O
her O
eyes O

in O
speechless O
agony O

to O
ascertain O

rushed O
forward O
at O

pinioned O

glared O
on O

frown O

malignity O

uttering O
execrations O

testified O
in O

way O
most O
truly O
flattering O

more O
deeply O

interesting O
countenance O

more O
interesting O

never O

be O
broken O

though O
it O
sometimes O
crossed O

animated O
conversation O
, O
he O
continued O
perfectly O
heedless O
of O
what O
was O
passing O
, O
till O
at O
length O
his O
own O
name O
, O
spoken O
in O
accents O
always O
dear O
to O
him O
, O
irresistibly O
enchained O
his O
attention O
. O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
was O
requesting O
Caroline S-PERSON
to O
sing O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
his O
favorite O
melodies O
, O
and O
she O
gayly O
resisted O
his O
entreaties O
, O
saying O
, O
in O
her O
liveliest O
accents O
, O
" O
No O

no O

wait O
patiently O
till O
the O
evening O

That O
was O
copied O
for O
me O
by O
Mr. O
De B-PERSON
Lancey E-PERSON
, O
and O
I O
promised O
he O
should O
be O
present O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
it O
was O
performed O
. O
I O
can O
refuse O
you O
nothing O
, O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
so O
I O
must O
seek O
safety O
by O
flight O
! O
" O
Nodding O
and O
smiling O
, O
with O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
her O
archest O
looks O
, O
Caroline S-PERSON
tripped O
lightly O
into O
the O
room O
, O
where O
Henry S-PERSON
sat O
, O
so O
shaded O
by O
the O
window O
- O
curtain O
, O
that O
he O
was O
perfectly O
invisible O
, O
when O
a O
moment O
afterwards O
she O
was O
followed O
by O
Mrs. O
Smythe S-PERSON
, O
who O
said O
in O
an O
excited O
tone O
of O
angry O
remonstrance O
, O
" O
Is O
there O
no O
end O
, O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
to O
this O
extraordinary O
intimacy O
of O
yours O
with O
young O
De B-PERSON
Lancey E-PERSON
! O
It O
really O
is O
becoming O
absurd O
! O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
is O
very O
much O
to O
blame O
in O
giving O
it O
any O
encouragement O
! O
A O
youth O
without O
prospects O
! O
without O
so O
much O
as O
a O

pursued O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
laughing O
. O
" O
You O
know O
, O
my O
dear O
aunt O

never O
centered O
all O

" O
Neither O
did O
I O
suppose O
you O
would O
dispense O
with O
both O

" O
replied O
Mrs. O
Smythe S-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
tone O
of O
increasing O
bitterness O
, O
and O
hurrying O
towards O
the O
door O
, O
evidently O
so O
irritated O
, O
that O
she O
dared O
not O
trust O
herself O
to O
remain O
. O
" O
Rather O
than O
have O
my O
niece O
united O
to O
a O
nameless O
outcast O
, O
living O
upon O
the O
bounty O
of O
Sir O
Arthur B-PERSON
Dunbar E-PERSON
, O
or O
of O
connections O
who O
are O
probably O
disgraced O
by O
his O
existence O

I O
would O
prefer O
seeing O
you O
married O
to O
the B-PERSON
Twopenny I-PERSON
Postman E-PERSON

for O
he O
at O

is O
independent O
, O

has O
something O

" O
A O
glow O
like O
fire O
rushed O
through O
Henry's S-PERSON
frame O
at O
these O
words O
, O
and O
before O
Mrs. O
Smythe S-PERSON
had O
closed O
the O
door O
, O
the O
hot O
blood O
seemed O
boiling O
in O
his O
veins O
with O
agonized O
shame O
and O
sorrow O
. O
Pale O
and O
red O
by O
turns O
, O
he O
leaned O
his O
head O
on O
his O
hands O
in O
solitary O
desolation O
, O
and O
quivered O
in O
every O
nerve O
with O
grief O
and O
self O
- O
reproach O
. O
The O
whole O
harvest O
of O
his O
happiness O
seemed O
blasted O
at O
a O
single O
breath O
| | O
his O
mind O
was O
a O
wild O
chaos O
of O
conflicting O
emotions O

and O
one O
only O
thought O
rose O
paramount O
to O
all O
, O
that O
he O
had O
been O
held O
up O
to O
ridicule O
and O
contempt O
, O
perhaps O
deservedly O
, O
in O
the O
eyes O
of O
that O
one S-CARDINAL
beloved O
being O
, O
the O
object O
of O
his O
dearest O
, O
first S-ORDINAL
, O

only O
attachment O
, O
He O
wreathed O
his O
hands O
together O
, O
and O
bent O
his O
head O
in O
a O
tempest O
of O
emotion O
, O
while O
the O
whole O
rich O
treasure O
of O
his O
affections O
and O
hopes O
lay O
mouldered O
into O
rubbish O
at O
his O
feet O

for O

felt O
and O
knew O
that O
all O
Mrs. O
Smythe S-PERSON
had O
said O
, O
was O
but O
too O
painfully O
true O

A O
dark O
extinguisher O
had O
fallen O
over O
every O
earth O
- O
born O

. O
He O
felt O
that O
it O
had O
been O
unpardonable O
even O
to O
desire O
that O
the O
happiness O
of O
another O
should O
be O
linked O
with O
his O
uncertain O
fate O

and O
he O
struggled O
long O
, O
though O
vainly O
, O
for O
composure O
, O
while O
contemplating O
the O
destruction O
of O
that O
one S-CARDINAL
hope O
which O
had O
contained O
the O
sum O
of O
all O
his O
earthly O
wishes O

" O
I O
will O
yet O
deserve O
her O

thought O
Henry S-PERSON
, O
overleaping O
impossibilities O
, O
or O
, O
with O
the O
sanguine O
feelings O
of O
a O
young O

ardent O
mind O

not O
even O
seeing O
them O

" O
Henry's S-PERSON
musings O
were O
disturbed O
by O
a O
slight O
noise O
near O
him O
, O
and O
when O
, O
with O
a O
flashing O
eye O
, O
he O
started O

looked O
up O

very O
object O

thoughts O

beside O
him O

he O
beheld O
Caroline S-PERSON

her O
cheeks O
suffused O
with O
the O
deepest O
emotion O

her O
downcast O

sparkling O
with O
tears O

while O
in O
hurried O
accents O
of O
extreme O
agitation O

tone O

his O

so O
it O
was O
with O

Miss O

partly O
in O
the O
character O

a O
cousin O
, O
partly O
as O
a O
convivial O
friend O
of O
Sir O
Patrick's S-PERSON
, O
and O
solely O
, O
in O
the O
estimation O
of O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
as O
her O
devoted O
admirer O

not O
one O
of O
the O
motives O

ostensibly O
brought O
him O
there O
was O
the O
real O

kept O
up O
long O

animated O

and O
- O
dog O
conversations O
with O
Sir O

, O
and O
love O
- O
and O
- O
nonsense O
conversations O
with O
Agnes S-PERSON
| | O
but O
his O
whole O
thoughts O
and O
attention O
were O
secretly O
devoted O
to O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
to O
so O
engrossing O
an O
extent O
, O
that O
he O
became O
astonished O
even O
at O
himself O
. O
She O
was O
always O
exceedingly O
busy O
about O
something O
when O
he O
called O
— O
more O
frequently O
out O

the O
room O
than O
in O
it O
, O
while O
he O
staid O
, O
and O
so O
constantly O
sat O
down O
to O
write O
letters O

notes O

talked O

still O
Marion S-PERSON
continued O

as O

treated O
him O

as O
the O
friend O

Sir O

almost O
like O

one S-CARDINAL
other O
young O
ladies O
among O
whom O
he O
had O
hitherto O
divided O
himself O

It O
was O
absolutely O
insufferable O
to O
see O
her O
so O
perfectly O
self O

possessed O

conversible O

without O
a O

always O
ready O
with O

when O
he O
spoke O
to O
her O

amused O
with O
his O
jests O
, O
but O
not O
sufficiently O
interested O
by O
his O
presence O

to O
attempt O
being O
either O
attractive O

repulsive O

Seeing O
him O
approach O
the O
table O
one O
day O
several O
times O
while O

was O
writing O
, O
Marion S-PERSON

at O

Captain O

in O
a O
low O

" O
Marion S-PERSON
at O
these O
words O
glanced O
with O
astonishment O
towards O
Agnes S-PERSON

privately O
thought O

sister's O

must O
require O
very O
great O
encouragement O
indeed O
, O
if O
he O
were O
not O
satisfied O
with O
all O
he O
got O

unwilling O
to O
interfere O
in O
any O
differences O
that O
might O
have O
arisen O
between O
them O
, O
she O
calmly O
resumed O
her O
employment O
, O
unconscious O
that O
the O
eyes O
of O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
were O
fixed O
upon O
her O
with O
a O
look O
of O
disappointment O
and O
pique O
, O
because O
she O
had O
not O
so O
much O
as O
favored O
him O
with O
a O
conscious O
blush O
. O
Nothing O
surprised O
and O
amused O
the O
young O
mind O
of O
Marion S-PERSON
half O
so O
much O
, O
as O
the O
light O
raillery O
and O
gay O
persiflage O
, O
which O
continually O
passed O
between O
her O
brother O
and O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
, O
whose O
conversation O
was O
enlivened O
with O
sallies O
of O
good O
- O
humored O
malice O
against O
each O
other O
, O
and O
lively O
satire O
, O
which O
sometimes O
approached O
the O
verge O
, O
and O
often O
even O
passed O
the O
verge O
of O
civility O
, O
while O
each O
seemed O
to O
have O
conferred O
on O
his O
friend O
the O
royal O
privilege O
of O
saying O

doing O
no O

so O
that O
the O
pointed O
arrows O

if O

only O

time O

positively O

replied O
Marion S-PERSON

finding O
herself O
obliged O
to O
speak O
, O
while O
her O
look O
of O
agitated O
consciousness O
, O
occasioned O
a O
thrill O
of O
jealousy O
in O
the O
heart O
of O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
, O
which O
brought O
a O
sudden O
flush O
into O
his O
countenance O

he O
assumed O
a O
careless O
tone O

conceal O

turned O

Sir O

the O
very O
temples O

instantly O

out O

was O

CHAPTER O
XXII O
. O
Nothing O
had O
ever O
surprised O
and O
annoyed O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
more O
than O
the O
unadmiring O
indifference O
with O
which O
, O
week O
after O
week O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
received O
his O
visits O
. O
Her O
easy O
, O
good O
humored O
courtesy O
of O
manner O
was O
unpardonable O
! O
No O
peculiar O
consciousness O
became O
visible O
in O
her O
manner O
, O
when O
he O
addressed O
her O
| | O
no O
accession O
of O
sensibility O
in O
her O
voice O
| | O
no O
agitation O
in O
her O
smile O
| | O
no O
increase O
of O
her O
natural O
timidity O
| | O
no O
desire O
of O
captivation O
, O
nor O
the O
slightest O
coquetry O
in O
displaying O
her O
own O
fascinations O
. O
To O
be O
thus O
treated O
like O
a O
cousin O
or O
a O
brother O
was O
mortifying O
in O
the O
extreme O
, O
and O
appeared O
to O
him O
perfectly O
unaccountable O
, O
because O
he O
little O
guessed O
the O
contrast O
which O
incessantly O
presented O
itself O
to O
Marion's S-PERSON
mind O
, O
between O
the O
low O
, O
every O
- O
day O
tone O
of O
his O
thoughts O
, O
on O
all O
the O
essential O
objects O
of O
existence O
, O
and O
the O
elevated O
sentiments O
or O
generous O
feelings O
, O
to O
which O
she O
had O
lately O
become O
accustomed O
in O
the O
society O
of O
Mr. O
Granville S-PERSON
. O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny's E-PERSON
conversation O
always O
diverted O
her O
on O
account O
of O
its O
eccentricity O
| | O
but O
in O
the O
selfishness O
and O
vanity O
he O
inadvertently O
betrayed O
, O
she O
saw O
how O
little O
he O
could O
know O
the O
real O
nature O
and O
value O
of O
that O
happiness O
springing O
from O
principle O
and O
affection O
, O
which O
alone O
could O
satisfy O
her O
heart O
. O
Formerly O
, O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
would O
have O
gloried O
in O
surmounting O
difficulties O
, O
if O
he O
had O
ever O
found O
any O
difficulties O
to O
conquer O
| | O
and O
now O
he O
was O
determined O
not O
to O
become O
discouraged O
, O
though O
he O
felt O
, O
if O
such O
a O
thing O
could O
be O
possible O
, O
almost O
humbled O
. O
His O
eye O
followed O
Marion S-PERSON
wherever O
she O
turned O
, O
and O
he O
was O
now O
for O
ever O
by O
her O
side O
, O
though O
she O
evidently O
made O
it O
her O
continual O
business O
to O
avoid O
him O
, O
as O
she O
had O
latterly O
become O
more O
aware O
than O
before O
of O
his O
assiduity O
. O
Fortified O
by O
the O
consciousness O
of O
her O
own O
secret O
engagement O
, O
and O
by O
the O
knowledge O
that O
Agnes S-PERSON
had O
a O
well O
- O
founded O
belief O
in O
his O
attachment O
to O
herself O
, O
Marion's S-PERSON
countenance O
, O
which O
told O
every O
transient O
emotion O
of O
her O
heart O
, O
never O
betrayed O
a O
thought O
of O
love O
| | O
and O
it O
seemed O
to O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
as O
if O
her O
heart O
must O
be O
of O
granite O
, O
so O
cold O
and O
hard O
beneath O
a O
smiling O
stream O
. O
She O
was O
long O
of O
even O
suspecting O
the O
worst O
, O
and O
would O
not O
fully O
believe O
when O
she O
did O
, O
that O
his O
volatile O
fancy O
had O
really O
changed O
| | O
yet O
a O
spell O
seemed O
over O
her O
, O
that O
she O
could O
not O
escape O
from O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny's E-PERSON
society O
, O
without O
giving O
offence O
to O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
and O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
who O
both O
, O
for O
different O
reasons O
, O
insisted O
on O
her O
being O
present O
when O
he O
called O
, O
though O
, O
unlike O
her O
sister O
, O
who O
would O
have O
sacrificed O
every O
one O
to O
herself O
, O
she O
would O
have O
sacrificed O
herself O
for O
every O
one O
, O
and O
only O
thought O
with O
considerate O
affection O
, O
how O
she O
could O
best O
spare O
the O
feelings O
of O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
escape O
from O
occasioning O
any O
jealousy O
, O
the O
fear O
of O
which O
now O
haunted O
her O
like O
a O
perpetual O
night O
- O
mare O
. O
One B-TIME
morning E-TIME
, O
when O
Agnes S-PERSON
was O
seated O
in O
a O
state O
of O
exceedingly O
full O
- O
blown O
satisfaction O
, O
expecting O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny's E-PERSON
usual O
visit O
, O
and O
considering O
him O
as O
much O
her O
own O
property O
as O
either O
her O
reticule O
or O
her O
work O
- O
box O
, O
she O
observed O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
occupations O
for O
every O
hour O
of O
the O
day O
, O
hastily O
gather O
up O
her O
drawing O
materials O
, O
and O
glide O
towards O
the O
door O
, O
evidently O
anxious O
to O
escape O
without O
observation O
, O
but O
in O
vain O
. O
The O
barometer O
of O
Agnes's S-PERSON
countenance O
had O
become O
exceedingly O
stormy O
, O
while O
watching O
Marion's S-PERSON
progress O
| | O
and O
being O
one O
who O
rather O
enjoyed O
the O
excitement O
of O
a O
quarrel O
than O
otherwise O
, O
she O
asked O
Marion S-PERSON
in O
a O
voice O
raised O
an O
octave O
higher O
than O
usual O
, O
which O
sounded O
as O
sharp O
and O
cutting O
as O
an O
east O
wind O
, O
where O
she O
was O
about O
to O
go O
, O
adding O
, O
in O
her O
most O
sarcastic O
tone O
, O
" O
Pray O
inform O
me O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
why O
I O
am O
to O
be O
left O
in O
solitude O
here O
, O
when O
everybody O
knows O
that O
in O
a O
place O
like O
this O
I O
cannot O
possibly O
receive O
visitors O
alone O
. O
One O
would O
suppose O
that O
you O
wished O
to O
prevent O
me O
from O
seeing O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON

morning E-TIME

" O
By O
no O
means O

Agnes S-PERSON

But O
is O
there O
any O
occasion O
for O
me O
to O
remain O
, O
when O
Patrick S-PERSON
of O
course O
accompanies O
him O
here O
as O
usual O
? O
" O
" O
Nonsense O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
. O
You O
know O
perfectly O
well O
that O
Patrick S-PERSON
may O
or O
may O
not O
be O
here O
, O
for O
that O
all O
depends O
on O
whims O
like O
your O
own O
, O
and O
nothing O
renders O
it O
correct O
to O
receive O
gentlemen O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
except O
there O
being O
two S-CARDINAL
of O
us O
at O
home O
. O
I O
expected O
more O
friendship O
and O
consideration O
from O
you O
| | O
but O
people O
never O
will O
think O
of O
any O
one O
but O
themselves O
! O
" O
" O
You O
are O
like O
a O
Hebrew S-NORP
scholar O
, O
and O
always O
read O
me O
backwards O
, O
Agnes S-PERSON

replied O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
good O
- O
humoredly O
re-seating O
herself O
, O

adding O

with O
a O
beautiful O
timidity O
of O
manner O
and O
voice O

" O
I O
cannot O

think O
that O

it O

perhaps O

better O

Agnes S-PERSON

looking O
perfectly O
sublime O
in O
her O
anger O

hide O

confusion O

the O

said O
Agnes S-PERSON

with O
an O

toss O

look O
fresh O
and O
gay O
, O
he O
broke O
off O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
a O
sentence O
from O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
and O
clandestinely O
approaching O
the O
table O
when O
Marion S-PERSON
was O
looking O
in O
another O
direction O
, O
he O
stole O
them O
all O
away O
, O
and O
substituted O
one O
so O
fresh O
and O
fragrant O
that O
Marion S-PERSON
uttered O
an O
exclamation O
of O
rapturous O
admiration O
. O
She O
neither O
blushed O
nor O
looked O
down O
, O
however O

but O
as O
if O
it O
were O
no O
more O
than O
an O
every O
day O
civility O
, O
held O
it O
up O
to O
Agnes S-PERSON
for O
admiration O
, O
and O
endeavored O
to O
attract O
her O
towards O
the O
table O
by O
the O
perfume O
of O
her O
beautiful O
flowers O
. O
" O
Nothing O
withered O
or O
blighted O
should O
ever O
be O
here O
, O
" O
said O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
, O
in O
his O
most O
sentimental O
tone O
. O
" O
I O
should O
like O
, O
in O
one S-CARDINAL
respect O
, O

resemble O

give O
nothing O

pleasure O
to O
all O

them O

writing O
prose O

I O
had O
the O
pen O
of O
Moore S-PERSON
, O
I O
could O
find O
one S-CARDINAL

for O
my O
muse O
more O
beautiful O
than O

cracked O
with O
looking O
from O
so O
great O
a O
distance O
. O
" O
Marion S-PERSON
was O
now O
seriously O
annoyed O
, O
and O
a O
glow O
of O
indignant O
vexation O
mantled O
upon O
her O
cheek O
| | O
but O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
, O
mistaking O
her O
blushes O
and O
silence O
, O
began O
to O
flatter O
himself O
that O
the O
fortress O
was O
not O
so O
impregnable O
as O
he O
had O
feared O
. O
A O
scrap O
of O
paper O
lay O
on O
the O
table O
, O
which O
Marion S-PERSON
had O
carelessly O
flung O
aside O
, O
after O
trying O
a O
pen O
, O
by O
writing O
down O
several O
times O
her O
own O
Christian S-NORP
name O
, O
and O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
having O
picked O
it O
up O
, O
laughingly O
added O
to O
it O
the O
name O
of O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
. O
" O
How O
does O
this O
look O
? O
" O
asked O
he O
, O
showing O
her O
the O
signature O
of O
" O
Marion B-PERSON
De I-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
, O
" O
while O
a O
gleam O
of O
light O
shot O
through O
his O
dark O
eye O
- O
lashes O
. O
" O
This O
is O
a O
valuable O
autograph O
, O
which O
I O
shall O
certainly O
preserve O

The O
signature O
is O
not O
yet O
a O
common O
one O
, O

I O
hope O
it O
may O
become O
so O
, O

There O
may O
be O
another O
that O
I O

very O
much O
prefer O

replied O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
decidedly O
, O
while O
the O
bright O
carnation O
mounted O
to O
her O
cheek O
, O

she O
turned O
her O
large O
eyes O
towards O
Agnes S-PERSON

who O
stood O
at O
some O
distance O
placid O
and O
secure O
, O
in O
the O
certain O
belief O
that O
her O
own O
supremacy O
was O
established O
, O
and O
that O
the O
conversation O
probably O
related O
to O
herself O
. O
" O
Give O
me O
back O
that O
paper O
, O
Captain O
De B-PERSON

, O
for O

contains O
a O
mischievous O

may O
in O

he O
, O
with O
undaunted O
pertinacity O

" O

short O
period O

Marion S-PERSON
, O
coldly O
. O
" O

" O
How O

it O
will O
look O
at O

" O
muttered O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
, O
almost O
inaudibly O
, O
in O
that O
low O
musical O
voice O
which O
had O
been O
irresistible O
, O
and O
with O
a O
significance O
of O
manner O
which O
Marion S-PERSON
seemed O
not O
to O
remark O
. O
" O
I O
hope O
one O

it O
there O

" O
" O
I O
intend O
it O

replied O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
dryly O
. O
— O
" O
That O

prayer O

" O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
, O
assuming O
a O
look O
of O
respectful O
despondency O
, O
examined O
the O
volumes O
during O
several B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
in O
silence O

but O
having O
accidentally O
opened O
the O
service O
of O
matrimony O
, O
he O
smilingly O
pointed O
it O
out O
to O
Marion S-PERSON

saying O
, O
" O
he O
hoped O
this O
might O
be O
considered O
a O
good O
omen O

doubling O
down O
the O
page O

he O
placed O
the O
prayer O

book O
opposite O
to O
her O

me O

Before O
Marion S-PERSON
had O
time O
to O
reply O
, O
or O
to O
hurry O
away O
, O
as O
she O
had O
been O
for O
some O
time O
projecting O
, O
Agnes S-PERSON
advanced O
with O
an O
air O
of O
exceedingly O
forced O
vivacity O
, O
while O
there O
was O
a O
perceptible O
flutter O
of O
anger O
in O
her O
tone O
, O
and O
Marion S-PERSON
felt O
as O
much O
confused O
as O
if O
she O
had O
been O
guilty O
of O
a O
real O
indiscretion O
, O
when O
she O
saw O
that O
her O
sister's O
face O
had O
become O
as O
white O
as O
the O
wall O

her O
eyes O
glassy O

her O
manner O
unusually O
excited O
, O
though O
she O
tried O
to O
assume O
a O
careless O
tone O

: O

throwing O
as O
much O

Marion S-PERSON
looked O
up O

a O
start O

astonishment O

at O
the O
hardened O
intrepidity O

manner O

which O
Captain O

carried O
on O
his O
double O
game O

his O
tone O
equally O
to O
suit O
either O

both O
of O
his O
companions O

it O
was O
with O
a O
sensation O
of O
extreme O
relief O

saw O
him O
at O
last O
rise O

exclaimed O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
with O
angry O
vehemence O
, O
after O
he O
had O
made O
a O
very O
conceited O
exit O
from O
her O
presence O
, O
accompanied O
by O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
, O
while O
she O
watched O
him O
from O
the O
window O
, O
as O
he O
sprang O
upon O
his O
horse O
, O
and O
galloped O
out O
of O
sight O
. O
" O
I O
know O

is O
perfectly O
devoted O
to O
me O

I O
cannot O
allow O
myself O
to O
doubt O
it O
! O
My O
whole O
happiness O
in O

is O
cast O
on O
that O
die O

must O
not O
be O
lost O

No O

" O
continued O
she O
, O
speaking O
to O
Marion S-PERSON
in O
a O
tone O
of O
unwonted O
perplexity O
, O
" O
it O
would O
indeed O
be O
a O
disgraceful O

die O

all O
frozen O
into O
icicles O
this B-TIME
morning E-TIME

yet O
I O
can O
scarcely O
tell O
why O
! O
A O
sensation O
of O
utter O
discouragement O
torments O
me O
! O
What O
is O
man O

what O
is O
woman O

all O
my O

now O
torn O
up O

grief O

Even O
after O
she O
had O
retired O
to O
the O
gloomy O
solitude O
of O
her O
lonely O
room O
, O
Agnes S-PERSON
buried O
her O
face O

as O
if O
she O
would O
hide O
herself O
from O

struggled O

banish O
thought O

the O
suspicion O
would O
force O
itself O
into O
her O
mind O
, O
that O
Captain O
De B-PERSON

intended O
to O
treat O

believed O
half S-CARDINAL

rubbish O

talked O

CHAPTER O
XXIII O
. O
One S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
best O
receipts O
for O
happiness O
in O
this O
world O
is O
, O
to O
make O
the O
utmost O
of O
small O
pleasures O
, O
and O
the O
very O
least O
of O
small O
vexations O
, O
which O
was O
the O
plan O
on O
which O
Marion S-PERSON
invariably O
lived O
| | O
and O
it O
often O
seemed O
as O
if O
all O
the O
duties O
of O
affection O
and O
friendship O
were O
written O
with O
a O
sunbeam O
on O
her O
mind O
. O
She O
now O
resolved O
, O
with O
characteristic O
kindness O
and O
good O
sense O
, O
that O
as O
her O
presence O
at O
St. B-FAC
John's I-FAC
Lodge E-FAC
could O
do O
no O
good O
to O
her O
sister O
, O
it O
should O
at O
least O
do O
no O
harm O
| | O
therefore O
she O
determined O
if O
possible O
to O
obtain O
leave O
of O
absence O
for O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
weeks E-DATE
from O
home O
, O
and O
to O
explain O
in O
writing O
to O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
her O
own O
opinion O
of O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny's E-PERSON
conduct O
, O
and O
the O
reasons O
on O
which O
it O
was O
grounded O
| | O
being O
convinced O
that O
in O
all O
the O
important O
affairs O
of O
life O
, O
perfect O
frankness O
between O
friends O
is O
, O
however O
painful O
, O
an O
imperative O
duty O
, O
and O
that O
no O
one O
, O
on O
any O
occasion O
where O
he O
has O
to O
act O
or O
to O
feel O
, O
should O
be O
left O
in O
the O
dark O
as O
to O
his O
own O
actual O
position O
. O
With O
a O
somewhat O
tremulous O
voice O
, O
and O
heightened O
color O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
proceeded O
next O
morning O
into O
her O
brother's O
private O
sitting O
- O
room O
, O
where O
, O
surrounded O
by O
a O
perfect O
armory O
of O
rifles O
, O
double O
- O
barrelled O
guns O
and O
pistols O
, O
she O
found O
him O
selecting O
his O
weapons O
for O
a O
pigeon O
- O
match O
to O
" O
come O
off O
" O
that O
day O
, O
between O
himself O
and O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
, O
of O
whose O
arrival O
he O
was O
in O
momentary O
expectation O
| | O
and O
he O
seemed O
by O
no O
means O
inclined O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
to O
lend O
her O
much O
of O
his O
notice O
. O
" O
I O
came O
to O
mention O
, O
Patrick S-PERSON
, O
that O
if O
you O
have O
no O
objection O
, O
it O
is O
my O
wish O
to O
spend O
a O
fortnight O
now O
, O
with O
uncle O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
Marion S-PERSON
. O
" O
We O
have O
met O
very O
seldom O
of O
late O
, O
and O
Henry B-PERSON
De I-PERSON
Lancey E-PERSON
is O
going O
off O
soon O
to O
join O
the O
army O
. O
Did O
you O
hear O
that O
a O
commission O
in O
the O
same O
corps O
as O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
, O
has O
been O
sent O
to O
him O
lately O
by O
his O
unknown O
friends O
. O
The O
regiment O
is O
going O
soon O
, O
I O
am O
told O
, O
to O
Canada S-GPE
, O
but O
he O
is O
to O
join O
the O
depot O
for O
some B-DATE
months E-DATE
at O
Portsmouth S-GPE
. O
" O
" O
Well O
! O
but O
what O
does O
all O
this O
matter O
to O
you O
! O
I O
shall O
not O
give O
my O
consent O
if O
you O
ask O
me O
till O
midnight O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
, O
peevishly O
| | O
for O
he O
felt O
by O
no O
means O
disposed O
that O
his O
house O
should O
lose O
the O
attraction O
of O
Marion's S-PERSON
resplendent O
beauty O
. O
" O
If O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
in O
his O
dotage O
, O
chooses O
to O
make O
himself O
ridiculous O
about O
this O
anonymous O
youth O
, O
is O
that O
any O
reason O
why O
the O
whole O
family O
should O
go O
wild O
about O
him O
? O
Besides O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
you O
confessed O
long O
ago O
, O
that O
Mr. O
Granville S-PERSON
visits O
at O
our O
uncle's O
| | O
and O
I O
am O
determined O
that O
you O
shall O
learn O
to O
know O
your O
own O
value O
better O
than O
to O
take O
him O
! O
What O
has O
he O
to O
offer O
you O
but O
that O
trumpery O
little O
cottage O
, O
like O
a O
Tunbridge S-GPE
- O
ware O
work O
- O
box O
, O
a O
kitchen O
garden O
stocked O
with O
cabbages O
, O
or O
gooseberry O
bushes O
, O
and O
to O
live O
upon O
brown O
bread O
and O
water O
. O
But O
I O
begin O
to O
suspect O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
that O
you O
are O
one O
of O
the O
very O
few O
people O
in O
this O
world O
who O
like O
their O
own O
way O
| | O
therefore O
it O
is O
my O
duty O
to O
keep O
you O
here O
out O
of O
danger O
. O
" O
" O
I O
wish O
to O
escape O
a O
danger O
, O
rather O
than O
to O
encounter O
one O
, O
" O
replied O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
with O
an O
ingenuous O
blush O
. O
" O
You O
know O
, O
Patrick S-PERSON
, O
that O
I O
consider O
Agnes S-PERSON
almost O
engaged O
to O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
. O
It O
would O
be O
a O
very O
great O
disappointment O
to O
me O
, O
and O
I O
think O
to O
yourself O
, O
if O
, O
after O
all O
that O
has O
passed O
, O
he O
become O
merely O
general O
in O
his O
attentions O
— O
showing O
no O
preference O
to O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
us O
more O
than O
for O
another O
. O
You O
always O
wish O
me O
to O
be O
in O
the O
room O
when O
he O
calls O
, O

— O

— O
— O
" O
" O
Oh O
! O
I O
understand O
! O

exclaimed O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
, O
fixing O
his O
hawk's O
eyes O
on O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
and O
trying O
to O
conceal O
a O
smile O
beneath O
a O
look O
of O
stern O
interrogation O
. O
" O
Agnes S-PERSON

jealous O
! O
" O
" O
No O
! O
not O
in O
the O
very O

be O
astonished O

certainly O
your O
apparition O

rather O
unexpectedly O

It O
made O
my O
mustachios O
perfectly O
stand O
upon O
end O

Marion S-PERSON
will O
not O
require O
a O
stroke O
of O
electricity O
for O
some O
time O
after O
this O
! O

rapidly O
petrifying O
into O
stone O
! O
" O
" O
Miss O
Marion B-PERSON

! O
if O
my O
presence O

unwelcome O

I O
wish O
it O
were O
possible O
to O
dissolve O
away O
in O
the O
likeness O
of O
a O
sigh O

said O
he O
, O
with O
a O
comic O
smile O

" O

invite O
myself O

sit O
down O

" O
" O
If O
you O

reach O
you O
a O

" O
replied O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
, O
while O
his O
face O
became O
perfectly O
crimsoned O
with O
trying O
to O
suppress O
a O
burst O
of O
laughter O
, O
when O
he O
observed O
the O
graceful O
timidity O
of O
Marion's S-PERSON
manner O
, O
contrasted O
with O
the O
easy O
assurance O
of O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny's E-PERSON
, O
who O
looked O
at O
her O
with O
undisguised O
admiration O
. O
" O
I O
had O
been O
inwardly O

Here O
is O
an O
undeniably O
fine O
day O

that O
ends O
all O

your O

she O
sent O
me O
here O
for O
the O
strings O

How O
much O
her O
dog O
Darling S-PERSON
has O
improved O
in O
the O
tone O

expression O
of O
his O
barking O
. O
" O
" O
Agnes S-PERSON

perfectly O

mad O
since O
you O
gave O
her O
that O
pert O

tempered O
little O
animal O

As O
Lord O
Byron S-PERSON
said O
, O
' O
nobody O

has O
got O
a O

all O

none O

I O
wish O
those O

sermons O
against O
cruelty O
to O
animals O
, O
would O
also O
say O
a O
little O
against O
over O

in O
the O
case O
of O

" O
" O
It O
is O
an O
amiable O
weakness O

" O
observed O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
tone O
that O
sounded O
very O
like O
contempt O
. O
" O
I O
suppose O
your O
sister O
would O
scarcely O
be O
outdone O
by O
Queen O
Henrietta B-PERSON

through O
a O
shower O
of O
bullets O
to O
save O
her O
favorite O
lap O

dog O

have O
, O
like O

shooting O

moreover O
, O
they O
are O
such O

which O
nothing O
can O
deliver O
them O

dogs O
generally O
meet O
with O
some O
return O

their O
attachment O

are O
always O
believed O

What O
do O
you O

, O
Miss O

not O
reason O

" O
Marion S-PERSON
colored O
to O
the O
very O
temples O
, O
embarrassed O
by O
the O
consciousness O
of O
all O
that O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
had O
evidently O
overheard O
, O
and O
after O
saying O
a O
few O
inaudible O
words O
, O
she O
would O
have O
hastened O
out O
of O
the O
room O

but O
on O
looking O
round O
, O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
, O
who O
privately O
thought O
that O
on O
the O
present O
occasion O
there O
might O
be O
one O
too O
many O

had O
strolled O
off O
to O
the O
drawing O

room O
, O

as O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
continued O
speaking O
, O
she O
could O
not O
, O
without O
actual O
rudeness O
, O
withdraw O
. O
A O
blush O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
beautiful O
phenomena O
in O
nature O
, O
and O
so O
thought O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
, O
when O
he O
perceived O
Marion's S-PERSON
color O
flitting O
like O
an O
aurora O
borealis O
, O
while O
for O
a O
moment O
she O
remained O
completely O
abashed O
, O
and O
then O
, O
with O
a O
look O
of O
apprehensive O
timidity O
, O
re-seated O
herself O
. O
" O
Excuse O
me O
, O
Miss O

said O
he O
, O
in O
a O
tone O
of O
unwonted O
gravity O
and O
respect O
, O
while O
his O
usual O
self O
- O
confident O
audacity O
seemed O
entirely O
to O
have O
forsaken O
him O
. O
" O
I O
became O
inadvertently O
a O
listener O
to O
- O
day O
, O
when O
my O
name O
was O
mentioned O
by O
you O
in O
terms O
of O
which O
I O
must O
entreat O
an O
explanation O
. O
You O
will O
think O
me O
perhaps O
rather O
too O
much O
of O
the O
free O
- O
and O
- O
easy O
school O
, O
if O
I O
take O
this O
liberty O

but O
the O
value O
I O
place O
upon O
your O
good O
opinion O

cousinly O
regard O
is O
such O
, O
that O
I O
shall O
neither O
eat O
nor O
sleep O
till O
you O
have O
enlightened O
me O
respecting O
the O
offences O

which O
I O
am O

thus O
condemned O
unheard O

forget O
all O
that O

unaccustomed O

conceal O
my O
thoughts O

" O
replied O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
trying O
to O
look O
particularly O
firm O

seeing O
that O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
still O
waited O
with O
an O
obvious O
resolution O
to O
obtain O
something O
more O
explicit O
, O
she O
felt O
herself O
urged O
on O
to O
say O
what O
, O
under O
ordinary O
circumstances O
, O
she O
would O
have O
sunk O
into O
the O
earth O
rather O
than O
utter O

therefore O
assuming O
a O
certain O
haughty O
dignity O
of O
manner O
quite O
unusual O
with O
her O
, O
she O
added O
, O
" O

almost O
consider O

in O
a O
rallying O
tone O

she O
could O
have O
smiled O
at O
this O
unusual O
fit O
of O
humility O
, O
which O
made O
him O
willing O
, O
for O
once O
, O
to O
suppose O
that O
his O
attentions O
could O
be O
insignificant O

seeing O
that O
she O
was O
now O
about O
to O
make O
a O
hasty O
exit O
from O
the O
room O
, O
he O
rapidly O
continued O
, O
with O
a O
slight O
relapse O
into O
his O
ordinary O
tone O
of O
conceit O
: O
" O
I O
am O
vain O
enough O
to O
think O
that O
I O
deserve O
to O
be O
preferred O
for O
something O
better O
than O
the O
mere O
accident O
of O
birth O
and O
fortune O
, O
with O
which O
the O
very O
meanest O
of O
mankind O
may O
be O
endowed O

but O
there O
are O
ladies O
— O

nobody O

who O
, O
if O
they O
were O
informed O

waited O
in O
the O
next O

marry O
them O
, O
with O
double O
my O
income O
, O
rank O
, O

property O
, O
would O
ask O
no O
other O
question O
, O
but O
put O
on O
a O
veil O
, O
get O
up O
a O
fit O
of O
bridal O
hysterics O
, O
and O
proceed O
to O
chapel O
. O
Such O
intimacies O
as O
mine O
with O
your O
sister O
are O
like O
a O
tread O
- O
mill O
, O
always O
apparently O
getting O
on O
, O
but O
never O
advancing O
, O

neither O
of O
us O
ever O
dream O
of O
going O
a O
step O

Agnes S-PERSON

at O

wondering O
admiration O

to O
make O
conquests O

not O
to O
keep O
them O

I O
would O
no O
more O
think O
of O
being O
seriously O
in O
love O
with O
her O
, O
than O
with O
a O
piece O
of O
Dresden S-GPE
china O
in O
a O
shop O
window O
. O
She O
should O
be O
shut O
up O
in O
a O
glass O
case O
, O
to O
be O
admired O
and O
forgotten O
every O

It O
is O
not O
the O
mere O
symmetry O
of O
form O

features O
that O
could O
permanently O
interest O
me O

Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
, O
looking O
a O
million S-CARDINAL
of O
things O

but O
Marion's S-PERSON
eyes O
were O
fixed O
on O
the O
door O
, O
while O
her O
whole O
countenance O
was O
in O
a O
glow O
of O
indignant O
vexation O
, O

he O
continued O

with O
increasing O
ardor O

how O
different O

Can O
you O
wonder O

can O
you O
blame O
me O
— O
that O
I O
see O
the O
disparity O
in O
mind O
as O
much O
as O
in O
appearance O
between O
yourself O

your O

to O
be O
taken O
up O
with O
pleasure O

laid O
aside O
without O
regret O

She O
might O
beguile O
a B-TIME
weary I-TIME
hour E-TIME

you O
would O
prevent O
the O

" O
Captain O
De B-PERSON

know O
not O
what O
the O
persiflage O
of O

it O
would O
be O
well O

the O
happiness O

your O
ideas O

replied O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
with O
restored O
firmness O

never O

not O
extremely O
ill O

I O
only O
wonder O
very O

so O

must O
be O
true O

recalled O
again O
and O
again O
to O
mind O
the O
thrilling O
tones O
of O
her O
voice O
, O
and O
the O
matchless O
loveliness O
of O
her O
countenance O
, O
till O
at O
length O
his O
attention O
being O
roused O
by O
the O
clock O
striking O
two S-CARDINAL
, O
he O
looked O
at O
the O
candles O
burning O
dimly O
in O
their O
sockets O

and O
prepared O
to O
wish O
himself O
good O
night O
. O
When O
about O
to O
rise O
, O
his O
attention O
was O
suddenly O
arrested O
by O
a O
rustling O
noise O
behind O
. O
The O
shadow O
of O
a O
figure O
became O
visible O
on O
the O
opposite O
wall O

it O
was O
distinctly O
outlined O
, O
and O
began O
slowly O
to O
move O
, O
when O
, O
springing O
to O
his O
feet O
with O
an O
exclamation O
of O
astonishment O
, O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny's E-PERSON
eye O
fell O
on O
the O
tall O
figure O
of O
a O
woman O
enveloped O
in O
dark O
draperies O
, O
who O
stood O
like O
a O
phantom O
close O
by O
his O
side O
, O
without O
speech O
or O
motion O
. O
While O
his O
eyes O
were O
riveted O
in O
silent O
consternation O
on O
this O
mysterious O
apparition O
, O
gradually O
the O
cloak O
was O
thrown O
aside O
, O
the O
veil O
dropped O
, O
and O
a O
countenance O
became O
disclosed O
so O
white O
and O
rigid O
, O
so O
soul O
- O
stricken O
in O
sorrow O
, O
so O
utterly O
without O
life O
or O
motion O
, O
that O
it O
seemed O
as O
if O
nothing O
on O
earth O
could O
have O
looked O
so O
supernaturally O
wretched O
. O
No O
moisture O
flouted O
over O
her O
large O
dilated O
eyes O
, O
which O
were O
glassy O
and O
fixed O
, O
her O
parted O
lips O
were O
livid O
as O
death O
, O
a O
mortal O
paleness O
was O
on O
her O
forehead O
and O
cheek O
, O
and O
not O
a O
sound O
became O
audible O
, O
for O
the O
grave O
itself O
was O
not O
more O
silent O
. O
With O
her O
emaciated O
hands O
riveted O
together O
, O
she O
stood O
the O
very O
image O
of O
woe O
| | O
while O
nothing O
human O
appeared O
in O
her O
face O
but O
its O
expression O
of O
mortal O
anguish O
. O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
gazed O
at O
this O
mysterious O
apparition O
, O
unable O
to O
believe O
the O
evidence O
of O
his O
senses O

A O
vital O
horror O
thrilled O
through O
his O
heart O

his O
eyes O
closed O
as O
if O
he O
would O
willingly O
have O
closed O
his O
vision O
against O
a O
sight O
which O
blasted O
him O

but O
at O
length O
, O
by O
a O
strong O
effort O
compelling O
himself O
to O
speak O
, O
he O
said O
, O
in O
a O
low O

doubtful O
tone O

" O

A O

her O

a O

low O

hollow O

concentrated O

that O
it O
seemed O
scarcely O

resembled O
a O
dreary O
echo O
from O
the O
tomb O

fixing O
a O
ghastly O
look O

words O

torrent O

while O
her O
very O
reason O
seemed O
stretched O
to O
it O
utmost O
verge O

She O
leaned O
against O
a O
table O

dragged O

ghastly O
features O

turned O

Captain O

she O
fixed O
on O
him O

with O
a O
look O
of O
dismal O
meaning O
, O
the O
blackest O
eyes O
that O
ever O
vied O
with O
night O

Vainly O
he O
endeavored O
to O
withdraw O
his O
gaze O
from O
that O
wild O
and O
haggard O
countenance O

or O
to O
shut O
his O
ears O
against O
the O
tempest O
of O
her O
words O

but O
there O
was O
a O
compression O
at O
his O
heart O

till O
his O
very O
breath O
seemed O
difficult O
to O
draw O

he O
listened O
to O
her O
almost O
frenzied O
ravings O

length O
, O
in O
a O
voice O

deep O

solemn O
import O

addressed O
her O

the O
color O
fled O
from O
his O
very O
lips O

agitation O

a O
cold O
shudder O
crept O
through O
his O
frame O

sit O
tamely O
down O

the O
suspicion O

I O
might O
be O
swindling O
another O
out O

Vague O
apprehensions O

sometimes O
crossed O
my O

me O
only O

beggary O
itself O

wildly O

off O

her O
hair O
, O
which O

Captain O

scarcely O
slept O
that O
night O
, O
— O
the O
moaning O
of O
the O
wind O
sounded O
dismal O
as O
the O
cry O
of O
departed O
spirits O
in O
his O
ears O
, O
and O
when O
at O
last O
his O
eye O
closed O
in O
feverish O
, O
restless O
slumber O
, O
he O
suddenly O
started O
up O
, O
thinking O
his O
name O
had O
been O
called O
out O
with O
a O
shriek O
of O
anguish O
in O
accents O
to O
which O
he O
had O
long O
been O
a O
stranger O
, O

unable O
to O
tell O
whether O
it O
had O
been O
a O
dream O
or O
a O
reality O
, O
he O
watched O
for O
some O
time O

agitated O
silence O

morning O
fell O

CHAPTER O
XXV O
. O
When O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
called O
two B-DATE
days E-DATE
after O
this O
at O
St. B-FAC
John's I-FAC
Lodge E-FAC
, O
to O
take O
leave O
before O
setting O
out O
for O
Yorkshire S-GPE
, O
he O
looked O
so O
absent O
and O
so O
agitated O
, O
that O
Agnes S-PERSON
became O
quite O
elated O
and O
flattered O
by O
what O
she O
attributed O
to O
his O
unconquerable O
regret O
at O
being O
obliged O
to O
take O
so O
long O
a O
leave O
of O
herself O
. O
She O
even O
forgave O
him O
for O
enquiring O
almost O
immediately O
what O
had O
become O
of O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
and O
answered O
with O
careless O
vivacity O
, O
" O
She O
is O
gone O
to O
her O
favorite O
home O
at O
Portobello S-GPE
. O
Marion S-PERSON
perfectly O
idolises O
her O
uncle O
. O
I O
should O
require O
to O
attend O
a O
series O
of O
lectures O
on O
naval O
tactics O
, O
and O
to O
take O
a O
course O
of O
nautical O
novels O
for O
a O
month O
, O
before O
I O
could O
get O
on O
with O
the O
Admiral O
as O
she O
does O
! O
My O
sister O
talks O
about O
the O
battles O
of O
Trafalgar S-GPE
and O
Camperdown S-GPE
, O
as O
if O
she O
had O
fought O
at O
them O
herself O
, O
but O
really O
somehow O
or O
other O
, O
I O
never O
can O
find O
a O
word O
for O
good O
, O
worthy O
sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
! O
" O
" O
And O
yet O
, O
" O
observed O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
, O
" O
you O
never O
seem O
very O
much O
at O
a O
loss O
for O
conversation O
, O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
when O
I O
have O
the O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
you O
! O
It O
is O
years S-DATE
, O
countless B-DATE

since O
I O
have O
entered O
his O
house O
, O

since O
he O
has O
entered O
mine O

but O
suppose O
we O
go O
down O
together O
some O
day O
, O
and O
cut O
out O
Marion S-PERSON
at O
once O
, O
by O
doing O
the O
agreeable O
in O
our O
very O
best O
and O
most O
fascinating O
style O
! O
" O
" O
If O
my O
uncle O
Doncaster S-GPE
were O
such O
a O
man O
, O
I O
should O
certainly O
make O
up O
to O
him O
greatly O
! O
" O
said O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
tone O
more O
than O
commonly O
in O
earnest O
. O
" O
It O
would O
be O
well O
worth O
your O
while O
to O
try O
. O
" O
" O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
has O
nothing O
to O
leave O
! O
you O
are O
quite O
mistaken O
there O
! O
" O
replied O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
inadvertently O
. O
" O
When O
we O
were O
perfect O
children O
, O
and O
all O
on O
the O
very O
best O
terms O
, O
he O
used O
to O
say O
that O
it O
would O
be O
quite O
enough O
for O
an O
old O
sailor O
like O
him O
, O
if O
he O
could O
bequeath O
us O
his O
watch O
and O
enough O
to O
bury O
him O
! O
As O
Pat S-PERSON
says O
, O
he O
might O
make O
his O
will O
on O
his O
thumb O
- O
nail O
. O
Oh O
! O
rest O
assured O

nothing O

" O
" O
I O

not O

" O
continued O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
, O
gravely O
. O
" O
A O
small O
income O
in O
his O
liberal O
hand O
has O
done O
more O
good O
than O
the O
very O
largest O
in O
any O
other O
person's O
. O
It O
is O
an O
odd O
phenomenon O
in O
nature O
, O
that O
the O
lightest O
purse O
always O
is O
the O
most O
open O
to O
others O
, O
while O
the O
heavier O
a O
purse O
grows O
the O
more O
its O
mouth O
becomes O
contracted O

A O
sort O
of O
spasmodic O
affection O

I O

" O
I O
wonder O

it O
will O
ever O

engraved O

tomb O

stones O

said O
Agnes S-PERSON

" O

Sir O

throwing O
his O

up O
in O
the O

catching O

those O

with O

smile O
on O

countenance O
, O
till O
the O
door O
had O
finally O
closed O

she O
rushed O
to O
the O
privacy O
of O
her O

room O

closed O

then O
seating O
herself O
, O
in O
all O
the O
luxury O
of O
solitude O
, O
she O
meditated O
with O
silent O
astonishment O
on O
all O
that O
had O
passed O
. O
No O
coroner's O
inquest O
can O
be O
summoned O
on O
a O
deceased O
flirtation O
, O
and O
whether O
it O
die O
a O
natural O
death O
or O
a O
violent O
one O
never O
can O
be O

as O
it O
may O
be O
caused O
merely O
by O
some O
trifling O
oversight O
, O
perhaps O
by O
the O
cruel O
aspersion O
of O
an O
enemy O
, O
or O
simply O
by O
whim O
and O
caprice O
, O
as O
in O
this O
case O
seemed O
the O
most O
probable O
, O
and O
to O
Agnes S-PERSON
the O
most O
mortifying O
. O
Wounded O
in O
all O
her O
most O
sensitive O
feelings O
, O
a O
crowd O
of O
angry O
and O
depressing O
thoughts O
crowded O
into O
her O
brain O
, O
while O
she O
could O
not O
but O
feel O
that O
the O
arrows O
which O
had O
struck O
her O
were O
most O
cruelly O
barbed O
and O
most O
skilfully O
aimed O
. O
It O
was O
harrowing O
to O
her O
vain O
, O
proud O
spirit O
, O
to O
imagine O
that O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
could O
really O
be O
indifferent O
. O
It O
seemed O
, O
indeed O
, O
almost O
impossible O
! O
Could O
his O
carelessness O
be O
all O
assumed O
! O
Had O
he O
, O
indeed O
, O
an O
honorable O
scruple O
of O
engaging O
her O
upon O
the O
uncertainty O
of O
his O
uncle's O
demise O
. O
It O
might O
be O
so O
. O
Agnes S-PERSON
felt O
that O
entire O
despondency O
would O
come O
soon O
enough O
, O
if O
come O
it O

Crespigny's E-PERSON
attachment O
, O
she O
seemed O
now O
resolved O
to O
keep O
up O
the O
farce O
with O
herself O
a O
little O
longer O
. O
She O
felt O
certain O
that O
he O
had O
cast O
back O
a O
look O
of O
regret O
on O
leaving O
the O
room O
, O
which O
spoke O
volumes O
, O
and O
these O
volumes O
she O
filled O
up O
according O
to O
her O
own O
imagination O
. O
The O
parting O
had O
, O
perhaps O
, O
been O
as O
painful O
to O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
as O
to O
herself O
, O
but O
what O
could O
he O
do O
if O
Lord O

always O
continued O
to O
be O
the O
" O
undying O

, O
" O
standing O
in O
the O
way O
of O
their O
mutual O
happiness O
. O
Agnes S-PERSON
now O
lived O
over O
every O
scene O
which O
had O
passed O
between O
herself O
and O
her O
supposed O
lover O
. O
She O
could O
not O
imagine O
those O
feelings O
expressed O
to O
any O
other O
which O
seemed O
created O
by O
herself O
alone O
. O
She O
recapitulated O
all O
his O
civilities O
to O
herself O
, O
remembered O
how O
his O
last O
sigh O
had O

sighed O

how O

after O
a O

proved O
as O
usual O
an O
effectual O
safety O

valve O
to O
any O
feelings O
of O
mortification O
, O
she O
became O
at O
last O
restored O
to O
the O
agreeable O
conviction O

that O

CHAPTER O
XXVI O
. O
The O
intellectual O
powers O
and O
literary O
acquirements O
of O
Henry B-PERSON
de I-PERSON
Lancey E-PERSON
were O
first S-ORDINAL
- O
rate O
, O
and O
feeling O
a O
consciousness O
of O
ability O
, O
he O
ardently O
longed O
to O
coin O
them O
into O
fame O
and O
distinction O
. O
Full O
of O
high O
aspirations O
, O
there O
was O
something O
grand O
in O
the O
outline O
of O
his O
head O
, O
and O
in O
the O
expression O
of O
his O
speaking O
eyes O
, O
while O
animated O
by O
his O
desire O
to O
render O
himself O
worthy O
of O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
and O
to O
reward O
the O
care O
of O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
by O
his O
own O
exertions O
. O
He O
longed O
now O
to O
run O
the O
race O
of O
life O
with O
others O
— O
to O
be O
useful O
among O
men O
— O
to O
win O
for O
himself O
a O
place O
in O
society O
— O
to O
write O
his O
name O
perhaps O
in O
the O
records O
of O
time O
— O
but O
above O
all O
, O
to O
promote O
the O
cause O
of O
truth O
, O
religion O
, O
and O
holiness O
. O
He O
had O
learned O
in O
the O
society O
of O
Mr. O
Granville S-PERSON
to O
believe O
that O
true O
happiness O
is O
not O
to O
be O
found O
in O
the O
temple O
of O
fame O
, O
nor O
in O
the O
temple O
of O
pleasure O
or O
of O
fortune O
, O
but O
in O
the O
temple O
of O
God O
| | O
and O
at O
one O
time O
his O
thoughts O
and O
studies O
were O
turned O
towards O
the O
church O
, O
with O
a O
fervent O
desire O
to O
take O
orders O
, O
till O
the O
tide O
of O
his O
plans O
became O
entirely O
changed O
by O
the O
unexpected O
arrival O
of O
a O
commission O
in O
the O
15th S-ORDINAL
Huzzars S-GPE
, O
then O
quartered O
in O
Canada S-GPE
, O
which O
he O
felt O
bound O
, O
from O
whatever O
hand O
it O
came O
, O
to O
accept O
. O
Henry S-PERSON
had O
been O
deeply O
affected O
when O
first S-ORDINAL
told O
all O
the O
peculiar O
circumstances O
of O
his O
own O
history O
, O
but O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
accustomed O
him O
from O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
to O
discuss O
the O
subject O
confidentially O
, O
that O
every O
recollection O
might O
be O
preserved O
which O
he O
yet O
retained O
of O
those B-DATE
earlier I-DATE

now O
involved O
in O
impenetrable O
mystery O
, O
which O
none O
but O
himself O
had O
witnessed O
, O
but O
the O
secret O
of O
which O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
still O
entertained O
a O
sanguine O
hope O

persuaded O
to O

Though O
lines O

deep O

were O
already O
riveted O
on O
the O
youthful O
countenance O
of O
Henry S-PERSON
, O
yet O
his O
manner O
became O
full O
of O
life O
and O
animation O

and O
in O
personal O
courage O
he O
was O
the O
boldest O
of O
the O
bold O
, O
displaying O
a O
fearless O
energy O
of O
character O
, O
which O
caused O
the O
Admiral O
to O
express O

on O
the O
night O
when O
they O
were O
about O
to O

a O
confident O

that O

though O
the O
service O
of O
his O
country O
had O
not O
been O
his O
choice O
, O
yet O
he O
was O
well O
suited O
to O
his O

" O

exclaimed O
Henry S-PERSON

warmly O
clasping O
the O

his O

" O
Often O

They O

Lancey E-PERSON

engaged O
his O

in O
the O
earliest O
coach O
next O
morning O
, O
and O
Marion S-PERSON
saw O
, O
by O
the O
paleness O
of O
his O
cheek O
, O
and O
the O
compression O
of O
his O

, O
that O
though O

he O
had O
the O
utmost O
difficulty O
in O
suppressing O
a O
burst O
of O
tears O
. O
The O
aged O
Admiral O
grasped O
his O
young O
friend's O
hand O
in O
silence O
, O
and O
leaning O
for O
some O
moments O
on O
his O
arm O
, O
he O
walked O
up O
and O
down O
the O
room O
with O
heavy O
measured O
steps O
, O
his O
eyes O
cast O
down O
, O
his O
noble O
forehead O
clouded O
with O
care O
, O
and O
his O
brows O
knit O
as O
in O
deep O
and O
painful O
thought O
. O
He O
too O
seemed O
to O
dread O
the O
greatness O
of O
his O
own O
agitation O
, O
being O
little O
fitted O
now O
to O

any O

it O
seemed O
to O
Marion S-PERSON
as O
if O
a O
tear O
had O
forced O
its O
way O
into O
his O

carefully O

Henry S-PERSON
paused O
in O
speechless O
emotion O

he O
clenched O
his O
hands O
together O
, O
the O
youthful O
fire O
of O
his O
eye O
became O
dimmed O
, O
and O
he O
hurried O
to O
the O
window O
for O
several O
moments O
, O
where O
, O
having O
in O
some O
measure O
recovered O
his O
composure O

he O
turned O
round O

tears O

down O

good O

venerable O
man O

all O

the O
most O
affecting O

overcome O
with O
emotion O
, O
Henry S-PERSON
took O
his O
benefactor's O
hand O
in O
his O
own O
, O
with O
an O
expression O
of O
the O
deepest O
solemnity O
and O
respect O
, O
saying O
, O
in O
rapid O
but O
tremulous O
accents O
, O
" O
It O
might O
soothe O
the O
very O
bed O

remember O

done O

more O
than O
almost O
any O

can O
ever O
do O
for O

The O
first S-ORDINAL
of O
earthly O
blessings O
is O
to O
be O
loved O

yet O

from O
your O
kindness O
to O
me O
from O
childhood O

no O
eye O

ever O

yourself O

the O
child O

of O
shame O

Sir O

mournfully O
held O
out O
his O
hand O

Henry S-PERSON

who O
kneeled O
down O

kissed O
it O
with O
the O
profoundest O
reverence O

then O
starting O
hastily O
up O
, O
he O
seemed O
about O
to O
rush O
out O
of O
the O
room O

when O
he O
was O
arrested O
by O
the O
deep O
, O
solemn O
voice O
of O
the O
Admiral O

whose O
eye O
had O
now O
become O
calm O

steady O
, O
while O
in O
a O
low O

impressive O
voice O
he O
said O
, O
" O
It O
is O
true O
, O
Henry S-PERSON

we O
shall O
probably O
meet O
no O

must O
you O
, O
that O
this O

our O
last O
interview O

long O
after O
I O

at O
rest O
in O
the O

may O
you O
remember O

may O

fervent O

you O

trusting O
that O
both O
my O
children O

In O
speaking O
of O
the O
past O
, O
Henry S-PERSON
, O
do O
not O
suppose O
that O
the O
obligation O
is O
all O
on O
your O
side O
! O
No O
! O
your O
dutiful O
affection O
has O
more O
than O
re-paid O
me O
. O
It O
is O
something O
to O
know O
that O
my O
aged O
years O
have O
not O
been O
spent O
in O
vain O
— O
that O
I O
leave O
a O
record O
in O
your O
heart O
, O
where O
my O
name O
will O
be O
respectfully O
and O
affectionately O
remembered O

No O
man O

can O
endure O
the O
thought O

being O
utterly O
forgotten O

and O
to O
you O
, O
my O
young O
friends O

I O
commit O
my O
memory O
. O
The O
earth O
will O
lie O
lighter O
on O
my O
grave O
for O
the O
belief O
, O
that O
you O
have O
loved O
me O
so O
well O
, O
and O
will O
so O
truly O
lament O
me O
. O
Your O
young O
spirits O
have O
cheered O
my O
heart O
— O
your O
welfare O
has O
deeply O
interested O
me O

and O
I O
know O
that O
one O
day O
or O
other O
, O
my O
young O
soldier O
will O
do O
me O
honor O
in O
his O
profession O
, O
and O
not O
forget O
to O
shed O
a O
tear O
over O
my O
remains O
. O
" O
Many O
were O
the O
tears O
of O
both O
Henry S-PERSON
and O
Marion S-PERSON
at O
these O
words O
| | O
but O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
calmly O
continued O
in O
a O
firmer O
voice O
, O
" O
When O
I O
called O
you O
back O
, O
my O
dear O
Henry S-PERSON
, O
it O
was O
not O
for O
any O
vain O
attempt O
to O
express O
my O
feelings O
, O
— O
that O
would O
be O
impossible O
, O
— O
but O
to O
mention O
how O
, O
in O
all O
probability O
, O
you O
may O
one O
day O
be O
able O
more O
than O
to O
return O
the O
little O
I O
have O
done O
. O
It O
is O
easy O
for O
men O
to O
wrestle O
through O
the O
difficulties O
of O
life O
, O
and O
with O
such O
talent O
and O
enter- O
enterprise O
as O
yours O
, O
to O
conquer O
them O
all O
. O
For O
other O
reasons O
, O
too O
, O
I O
have O
no O
doubt O
of O
your O
at O
last O
being O
most O
happily O
settled O
for O
life O
, O
but O
many O
anxious O
thoughts O
beset O
me O
respecting O
Marion S-PERSON
. O
The O
uncertainty O
of O
Richard B-PERSON
Granville's E-PERSON
prospects O
, O
and O
the O
certainty O
that O
my O
nephew O
will O
refuse O
his O
consent O
to O
her O
marriage O
, O
weighs O
heavily O
at O
my O
heart O
. O
I O
do O
trust O
that O
a O
long O
life O
of O
happiness O
awaits O
you O
both O
| | O
but O
if O
my O
worst O
anticipations O
were O
ever O
to O
be O
realised O
— O
if O
your O
brother O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
a O
bankrupt O
already O
in O
fortune O
and O
character O
, O
were O
hereafter O
to O
desert O
you O
— O
if O
your O
sister O
, O
heartless O
and O
vain O
, O
should O
throw O
herself O
away O
, O
and O
leave O
you O
in O
bleak O
and O
sorrowful O
loneliness O
, O
— O
then O
remember O
, O
Henry S-PERSON
, O
my O
solemn O
and O
last O
injunction O
is O
laid O
upon O
you O
, O
to O
act O
as O
a O
brother O
towards O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
— O
much O
may O
then O
be O
in O
your O
power O
— O
more O
than O
you O
now O
expect O
— O
and O
you O
must O
then O
protect O
her O
, O
as O
I O
would O
have O
done O
myself O
, O
considering O
all O
that O
you O
may O
ever O
do O
for O
her O
, O
as O
done O
for O
me O
. O
" O
" O
It O
would O
be O
something O
to O
live O
for O
, O
if O
I O
had O
a O
hope O
of O
being O
useful O
to O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
! O
Under O
any O
circumstances O
that O
would O
have O
been O
a O
pleasure O
| | O
but O
now O
it O
has O
become O
ten S-CARDINAL
times O
more O
a O
sacred O
duty O
than O
ever O
. O
Your O
injunction O
shall O
remain O
with O
me O
till O
my O
dying O
hour O
! O
" O
In O
the O
solitude O
and O
silence O
of O
his O
own O
apartment O
, O
Henry S-PERSON
gave O
ample O
vent O
to O
his O
long O
- O
suppressed O
anguish O
, O
while O
mourning O
over O
the O
sad O
conviction O
, O
that O
he O
had O
now O
seen O
, O
probably O
for O
the O
last O
time O
, O
that O
generous O
and O
noble O
- O
hearted O
benefactor O
, O
whom O
he O
loved O
with O
an O
enthusiasm O
to O
which O
no O
words O
could O
do O
justice O
. O
Though O
every O
action O
of O
his O
life O
had O
been O
actuated O
by O
grateful O
attachment O
, O
he O
now O
felt O
as O
if O
his O
existence O
had O
been O
wasted O
without O
sufficiently O
testifying O
his O
ardent O
affection O
, O
and O
he O
wondered O
to O
think O
that O
any O
opportunities O
were O
ever O
formerly O
overlooked O
, O
of O
conversing O
with O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
and O
attending O
on O
him O
. O
Henry S-PERSON
thought O
of O
his O
growing O
infirmities O
, O
of O
his O
solitary O
home O
, O
of O
his O
high O
spirit O
, O
and O
of O
his O
resolute O
mind O
, O
now O
enervated O
by O
advancing O
years S-DATE
, O
and O
mourned O
to O
think O
that O
in O
sickness O
, O
or O
even O
at O
the O
hour O
of O
death O
, O
he O
himself O
must O
no O
longer O
be O
at O
hand O
, O
to O
console O
and O
support O
his O
benefactor O
. O
Exhausted O
nature O
at O
length O
needed O
repose O
, O
and O
amidst O
the O
stillness O
and O
darkness O
of O
a O
night O
which O
had O
already O
seemed O
interminable O
, O
Henry S-PERSON
felt O
himself O
slowly O
sinking O
into O
the O
calmness O
of O
slumber O
, O
when O
suddenly O
he O
was O
awakened O
to O
consciousness O
by O
a O
slight O
rustling O
sound O
from O
beside O
his O
bed O
, O
and O
the O
noise O
of O
some O
one O
breathing O
, O
as O
if O
trying O
in O
vain O
to O
suppress O
it O
. O
Uncertain O
what O
this O
might O
be O
, O
he O
opened O
his O
eyes O
, O
and O
lay O
perfectly O
immoveable O
| | O
but O
gradually O
his O
heart O
almost O
ceased O
to O
beat O
, O
and O
quailed O
with O
a O
feeling O
of O
supernatural O
apprehension O
, O
when O
the O
curtains O
were O
slowly O
opened O
, O
and O
a O
dark O
form O
cautiously O
stooping O
over O
him O
, O
gazed O
into O
his O
face O
, O
till O
he O
felt O
the O
warm O
breath O
upon O
his O
cheek O
. O
In O
the B-TIME
dead I-TIME
hour I-TIME
of I-TIME
the I-TIME
night E-TIME
, O
Marion S-PERSON
was O
startled O
out O
of O
a O
dull O
, O
heavy O
, O
unrefreshing O
sleep O
, O
by O
a O
sharp O
shrill O
cry O
for O
help O
, O
which O
seemed O
to O
proceed O
from O
Henry's S-PERSON
room O
, O
and O
was O
succeeded O
by O
stifled O
cries O
, O
and O
the O
sound O
of O
a O
violent O
scuffle O
. O
Springing O
out O
of O
bed O
with O
an O
instantaneous O
decision O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
flew O
towards O
the O
spot O
, O
calling O
loudly O
for O
assistance O
, O
and O
the O
instant O
she O
opened O
the O
door O
, O
some O
one O
, O
uttering O
a O
wild O
and O
fearful O
shriek O
, O
rushed O
violently O
out O
, O
striking O
her O
what O
seemed O
at O
the O
moment O
a O
severe O
blow O
on O
the O
arm O
, O
but O
an O
instant O
afterwards O
she O
became O
deluged O
with O
blood O
. O
Henry S-PERSON
was O
in O
the O
act O
of O
eagerly O
pursuing O
the O
rapidly O
receding O
figure O
, O
when O
, O
seeing O
Marion S-PERSON
stagger O
backwards O
, O
he O
caught O
her O
in O
his O
arms O
, O
supported O
her O
to O
a O
chair O
, O
and O
hastily O
bound O
up O
her O
wound O
, O
which O
was O
bleeding O
profusely O
. O
" O
Leave O
me O
! O
I O
am O
well O
! O
Look O
to O
my O
uncle O
, O
" O
cried O
she O
, O
eagerly O
. O
" O
He O
must O
have O
been O
alarmed O
! O
How O
was O
it O
, O
Henry S-PERSON
? O
Are O
you O
hurt O
? O
Is O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
safe O
? O
Oh O
! O
there O
he O
is O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
she O
, O
rushing O
into O
her O
uncle's O
arms O
, O
and O
bursting O
into O
tears O
. O
" O
Here O
is O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
too O
! O
" O
added O
Henry S-PERSON
, O
turning O
round O
, O
as O
that O
gentleman O
entered O
with O
a O
calm O
but O
rather O
anxious O
look O
, O
while O
the O
paleness O
of O
his O
cheek O
was O
almost O
startling O
. O
" O
You O
seem O
, O
Sir O
, O
to O
have O
dropped O
ready O
dressed O
from O
the O
clouds O
! O
" O
" O
I O
seldom O
retire O
early O
to O
bed O

" O
replied O
he O
, O
with O
a O
quick O
, O
sharp O
, O
scrutinizing O
glance O
at O
Henry S-PERSON
. O
" O
Hearing O
a O
tumult O
in O
the O
house O
, O
I O

I O
— O

" O
You O
gave O
it O
time O
to O
subside O
before O
attempting O

added O
Henry S-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
thrilling O
emphasis O
in O
his O
voice O
, O
while O

replied O
he O
, O
gnawing O
his O
nails O
to O
the O
very O
quick O
, O
while O
he O
shot O
a O
momentary O
glance O
of O
rancorous O
detestation O
at O
young O
De B-PERSON
Lancey E-PERSON
, O
after O
which O
, O
his O
features O
became O
as O
passionless O
and O
immoveable O
as O
if O
they O
had O
been O
fixed O
in O
a O
vice O

" O
The O

very O

I O
met O
the O
man O
rushing O
out O
of O
the O
house O
, O
" O
answered O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
, O
with O
the O
air O
of O
one O
outfacing O
an O
accusation O
, O
but O
his O
voice O
became O
low O
and O
suffocated O
. O
" O
I O
attempted O
to O
stop O
him O

— O
— O
" O
" O
I O
am O
glad O

" O
observed O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
looking O
anxiously O
at O
Henry S-PERSON
, O
and O
then O
gazing O
intently O
on O
the O
sallow O
countenance O
of O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
, O
which O
became O
gradually O
dyed O
with O
the O
deepest O
hectic O
| | O
his O
lips O
were O
now O
closely O
compressed O
, O
he O
raised O
his O
tall O
figure O
to O
its O
full O
height O
, O
and O
closed O
his O
eyes O
, O
as O
if O
wishing O
thus O
to O
exclude O
some O
fearful O
spectre O
from O
his O
mind O
, O
but O
after O
a O
momentary O
struggle O
, O
he O
became O
once O
more O
calm O
and O
resolute O
, O
with O
a O
singular O
serenity O
of O
look O
and O
manner O
. O
" O
You O
met O
some O
one O
in O
the O
passage O
! O
The O
assassin O
must O
have O
escaped O
long O
before O

" O
muttered O
Henry S-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
vague O
and O
dreaming O
tone O

but O
his O
brow O
grew O
darker O
, O
and O
there O
was O
an O
anxious O
intensity O
in O
his O
look O
and O
voice O
, O
when O
he O
added O
in O
a O
tone O
of O
resolute O
determination O
, O
" O
Let O
me O
be O
plain O
with O
you O

Mr. O

! O
Your O
expression O
of O
countenance O
when O
I O
saw O
you O
last O
night O
, O
filled O
me O
with O
astonishment O
— O
almost O
with O
apprehension O

it O
was O
a O
look O
never O
to O
be O
forgotten O
! O
Your O
manner O
now O
perplexes O
me O
! O
There O
is O
something O
amiss O
which O
I O
cannot O
understand O
, O
but O
for O
your O
sake O
as O
well O
as O
my O
own O

this O
very O
strange O
affair O

be O
fully O
investigated O

" O
" O
You O
suspect O
me O

exclaimed O
Mr. O
Howard S-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
sudden O
laugh O
of O
terrible O
mirth O
, O
and O
in O
a O
voice O
elevated O
into O
accents O
of O
indescribable O
fury O
, O
while O
his O
eye O
throwing O
off O
the O
torpor O
in O
which O
it O
had O
been O
shrouded O
, O
glittered O
with O
the O
fearful O
brightness O
of O
delirium O
, O
his O
veins O
became O
swollen O
, O
and O
his O
figure O
dilated O
beyond O
its O
ordinary O
height O
, O
assuming O
an O
aspect O
of O
rage O
and O
of O
almost O
supernatural O
strength O
, O
such O
as O
insanity O
alone O
can O
give O
. O
" O
You O
suspect O
me O

you O
have O
dared O
to O
confess O
it O

Many O
a O
word O
lightly O
spoken O

weight O

The O
arrow O
has O
been O
shot O
at O
random O
, O

you O
are O
right O

Lightning O
rushes O
through O
my O
brain O
! O
I O
would O
be O
destructive O
as O
a O
whirlwind O
to O
you O
, O
De B-PERSON
Lancey E-PERSON
, O
as O
I O
once O
was O
to O
your O
wretched O
mother O

stood O
in O
the O
way O

my O
advancement O

as O
you O
may O
yet O
do O
, O
— O
she O
accused O

betrayed O

and O
ruined O
my O
sister O

" O
continued O
he O
in O
a O
rapid O
voice O
, O
insupportably O
shrill O
and O
piercing O
. O
" O
You O
too O
have O
injured O
me O

shall O
suffer O

" O
With O
the O
spring O
and O
the O
strength O
of O
a O
tiger O
, O
he O
rushed O
toward O
Henry S-PERSON

and O
a O
knife O

he O
had O
plucked O
from O

gleamed O
like O
lightning O
in O
the O
air O

suddenly O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
placed O
himself O
so O
as O
to O
intercept O
the O
madman's O
career O

fixed O
upon O

a O
look O

lofty O
composure O

Henry S-PERSON

advance O
before O
him O

Marion S-PERSON
, O
with O
frantic O
vehemence O

called O

horror O

still O
fastening O

eyes O

up O

looking O
with O
surprise O
at O

haste O
! O
" O
When O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
entered O
the O
room O
, O
there O
was O
a O
look O
of O
unwonted O
care O
in O
his O
fine O
countenance O
, O

less O
firmness O
in O
his O
step O

usual O
. O
He O
silently O

cordially O
shook O
hands O
with O
Agnes S-PERSON

a O
look O
of O
almost O
compassionate O
kindness O
beamed O
in O
his O
countenance O
, O
and O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
with O
girlish O
delight O
sparkling O
in O
her O
eyes O
, O
and O
dimpling O
in O
her O
cheeks O
, O
led O
him O
to O
a O
chair O
, O
on O
which O
he O
sat O
down O
for O
some O
moments O
without O
speaking O
, O
apparently O
fatigued O
and O
agitated O
, O
while O
she O
filled O
up O
the O
pause O
which O
ensued O
, O
by O
taking O
his O
hat O
and O
stick O
, O
placing O
her O
arm O
within O
his O
when O
she O
seated O
herself O
by O
his O
side O
, O
and O
showing O
a B-CARDINAL
thousand E-CARDINAL
demonstrations O
of O
her O
heartfelt O
affection O
and O
respect O
. O
" O
Uncle O
Arthur S-PERSON

said O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
observing O
him O
at O
length O
glancing O
round O
the O

" O
No O

I O
never O
expected O

he O
, O
in O
a O
tone O
of O
profound O
sadness O

" O
Never O

" O
No O

Agnes S-PERSON
, O
with O
the O
most O
perfect O
intrepidity O

countenance O

have O
met O
him O

the O
Park O

" O
I O
did O
not O
perceive O
him O

it O
was O
as O
well O

answered O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
with O
melancholy O
sternness O
. O
" O
The O
seldomer O

" O
" O
Uncle O

you O
are O
growing O
angry O

personal O

interrupted O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
beseeching O
tone O
, O
while O
she O
shook O
his O
hand O
caressingly O
in O
her O
own O
. O
" O
That O
is O
the O
harshest O
thing O

continued O
the O
Admiral O
, O
with O
angry O
vehemence O
, O
while O
his O
neckcloth O
seemed O
growing O
too O
tight O
for O
him O
. O
" O
Sir O

without O

flatter O
him O

greatest O
scamp O

sometimes O

Sir O

out O
his O
hand O
to O
both O
his O

in O
a O
tone O

Marion S-PERSON

grieved O

alarmed O

increasing O
agitation O

hastily O

away O

the O

away O

his O

still O

uncle's O
hand O
affectionately O
, O
hot O
tears O
coursed O
each O
other O
down O
her O
face O
, O
and O
she O
gazed O
earnestly O
at O
his O
countenance O
, O
while O
, O
looking O
at O
her O
with O
his O
usual O
expression O
of O
benignity O
and O
kindness O
, O
he O
continued O
, O
" O
You O

There O
is O
one S-CARDINAL
heart O
in O
my O
brother's O
family O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
that O
feels O
as O
his O
child O
ought O
to O
feel O
, O
and O
one S-CARDINAL
eye O
that O
will O
be O
dimmed O
with O
sorrow O

I O
am O
no O

your O

yours O
only O

Well O
may O
the O
young O
weep O
for O
sorrow O
— O
they O
have O
long O
to O
endure O
it O
, O

for O
me O
, O
the O
end O
of O
all O
earthly O
things O

at O
hand O

Many O
a O
warning O
bell O
has O
reached O
my O
ear O
already O
, O
and O
I O
would O
wish O
only O
to O
see O
you O
launched O
under O
safe O
protection O
in O
the O
stormy O
ocean O
of O

With O
no O

a O

worse O

nobody O

an O
old O

are O
you O
to O
do O
? O
" O
Marion S-PERSON
glanced O
at O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
who O
tried O
to O
preserve O
her O
usual O
air O
of O
consequential O
indifference O
, O
and O
pulled O
her O
bouquet O
to O
pieces O
, O
with O
an O
expression O
of O
silent O
and O
majestic O
impatience O
, O
but O
she O
neither O
looked O
up O
nor O
answered O
. O
" O
While O
I O
live O
, O
you O
can O
always O
confer O
a O
pleasure O

" O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
evidently O
not O
much O
delighted O
at O
this O
unexpected O
proposal O
of O
being O
located O
at O
what O
she O
always O
called O
" O
the O
Admiral's O
humdrummery O

" O
now O
assumed O
a O
pre-engaged O
look O
, O

practising O
a O

graceful O
attitude O
in O
the O
opposite O

drawing O
out O
her O
long O
glossy O
ringlets O
with O
a O
cold O

artificial O
smile O

she O
answered O

" O
Reckoning O

whispered O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
, O
entering O
with O
a O
look O
of O
assumed O
bravado O
, O

of O
evident O
embarrassment O
. O
" O

replied O
the O
Admiral O
, O
drily O
, O
and O
drawing O
himself O
up O
to O
his O
full O
height O
, O
while O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
bowed O
and O
smiled O
with O
an O
air O
of O
sarcastic O
gratitude O

" O
Certainly O

I O
hate O

themselves O

continued O
Sir O

stealing O
a O
look O
of O
laughing O
condolence O
at O

" O
" O
In O
respect O
to O

I O
can O
promise O
nothing O

I O
would O
raise O
a O

muttered O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
whose O
face O
now O
looked O
like O
a O
thunder O
cloud O

" O

advancing O
with O
sudden O

speaking O
in O
a O
tone O
of O
deep O
vehemence O

solemnity O

his O
noble O

serious O
countenance O
assumed O
an O

that O

nothing O

up O

down O

advice O

You O
have O
the O
world O
upon O
a O
string O
, O
and O
shall O
see O
a O
large O
assortment O
of O
admirers O
to O
choose O
among O
. O
When O
torrents O
of O
proposals O
are O
pouring O
in O
upon O
you O
, O
as O
they O
will O
and O
must O
do O
soon O
, O
get O
safely O
into O
the O
haven O
of O
matrimony O
, O
or O
you O
will O
be O
shipwrecked O
for O
ever O
. O
Accomplished O
misses O
are O
quite O
a O
drug O
in O
the O
market O
now O
| | O
but O
you O
ought O
to O
be O
ashamed O
, O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
of O
missing O
that O
little O
pigmy O
peer O
, O
Lord B-PERSON
Bowater E-PERSON
, O
two B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago E-DATE
, O
when O
you O
had O
three B-DATE

the O
start O
of O
every O
other O
young O
lady O
in O
making O
the O
acquaintance O
. O
He O
treated O
you O
shockingly O
, O
to O
fall O
in O
love O
at O
first O
sight O
with O
that O
paltry O
Miss O
Gordon S-PERSON
. O
As O
for O
any O
other O
coronet O
you O
are O
ever O
likely O
to O
wear O
, O
I O
know O
of O
none O
that O
even O
a O
telescope O
could O
give O
you O
the O
most O
distant O
prospect O
of O
. O
Now O
wait O
till O
I O
am O
out O
of O
the O
room O
before O
you O
faint O
! O
" O
" O
Marion S-PERSON

" O
said O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
yawning O
outrageously O
when O
her O
brother O
had O
departed O
, O
and O
looking O
unspeakably O
forlorn O
, O
" O
How O
often O
I O
have O
laughed O
ready O
to O
die O

' O
The O
poor O

, O
then O
, O
see O
their O
father O
obliged O
to O
undergo O
the O
wretchedness O
of O
frequenting O
a O
club O
, O
to O
form O
suitable O
acquaintances O

suffering O
hourly O

all O

plunged O
into O
a O

Then O

, O
given O
at O
an O

the O
young O

" O
added O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
ironically O
. O
" O
I O
remember O
formerly O
, O
when O
these O
Malcolm S-PERSON

were O
in O
their O
school O

chief O
bugbear O

over O
them O
, O
if O
they O
neglected O
the O
arts O
of O
dress O

fascination O
, O
was O
, O
that O
they O
would O
inevitably O
die O
old O
maids O
. O
They O
were O
educated O
for O
the O
profession O
of O
matrimony O
, O
and O
were O
each O
taught O
to O
expect O
a O
husband O
of O
rank O
and O
fortune O
, O
at O
the O
very O
least O
, O
equal O
to O
their O
father's O

" O
" O
Yes O
, O
" O
said O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
" O
Lady O
Towercliffe S-PERSON
would O
consider O
any O
one O
of O
her O
very O
plain O
daughters O

perfectly O
disgraced O
, O
either O

not O

The O
position O
of O

indolently O

to O
give O
him O

few O
presentable O

he O
lived O
in O
the O
dark O
ages O
, O
when O
old O
Queen B-PERSON
Charlotte E-PERSON
used O
to O
keep O
the O
ladies O
all O
so O
preternaturally O
precise O
and O
decorous O
. O
Most O
of O
the O
Admiral's S-NORP
notions O
he O
had O
from O
his O
mother O

who O
lived O

I O
believe O
, O
with O
Queen O

" O
" O
But O
Agnes S-PERSON
! O
even O
the O
prejudices O
of O

be O
attended O

He O
shows O
us O
greater O
kindness O

we O
ever O
have O
known O

can O
know O
from O

the O
whole O

flay O

not O

Sir O

we O
must O
humor O
him O
sometimes O

One B-DATE

, O
long O

I O
took O
him O
in O
delightfully O
, O
by O
saying O
that O
if O
he O
disapproved O
of O
waltzing O
, O
I O
hoped O
he O
would O
not O
object O
to O
a O
galope O

At O
Harrowgate S-ORG
, O
the O
military O
men O
will O
all O
fortunately O
be O
out O

Sir O

never O
guess O
who O

what O
they O
are O

he O
has O
a O
most O
inconvenient O
dislike O

When O
Marion S-PERSON
spoke O
from O

sat O
down O
to O
the O

music O
was O

her O

of O
Agnes S-PERSON

was O
a O
brilliant O
bravura O

voice O
dazzled O
and O
astonished O
by O
its O
uncommon O
brilliancy O

Sir O

" O
Having O
reached O
this O
conclusion O
, O
she O
was O
almost O
startled O
to O
hear O
herself O
addressed O
by O
her O
unknown O
neighbor O
, O
in O
a O
consequential O
, O
rather O
patronising O
voice O
, O
and O
with O
an O
air O
of O
unembarrassed O
distinction O
, O
while O
he O
evidently O
watched O
her O
countenance O
with O
the O
same O
look O
of O
criticism O
as O
before O
, O
so O
that O
she O
felt O
certain O
if O
there O
had O
been O
a O
flaw O
in O
her O
teeth O
, O
or O
a O
single O
hair O
disarranged O
on O
her O
head O
, O
it O
could O
not O
have O
escaped O
his O
notice O
. O
So O
fastidious O
a O
personage O
seemed O
almost O
worth O
the O
trouble O
of O
pleasing O
, O
and O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
after O
replying O
rather O
graciously O
to O
his O
first S-ORDINAL
few O
remarks O
, O
became O
exceedingly O
surprised O
to O
discover O
that O
there O
was O
a O
tone O
of O
well O
bred O
command O
in O
his O
dry O
, O
cynical O
manner O
, O
united O
with O
the O
most O
perfect O
polish O
, O
which O
both O
awed O
and O
surprised O
her O
. O
His O
assumption O
of O
superiority O
and O
importance O
seemed O
almost O
unconscious O
, O
but O
he O
evidently O
entertained O
not O
the O
fraction O
of O
a O
doubt O
that O
his O
conversation O
was O
a O
singular O
honor O
and O
an O
agreeable O
acquisition O
to O
any O
one O
on O
whom O
he O
condescended O
to O
bestow O
the O
slightest O
attention O
. O
" O

twenty S-CARDINAL

Agnes S-PERSON

an O

unpardonably O
ugly O

she O
prudently O
sipped O
her O

looking O
somewhat O

himself O

aware O
that O
the O
middle O
- O
aged O

nearly O
good O
- O
looking O
, O
and O
very O
elegant O
man O
beside O
her O
, O
was O
actually O
the O
old O
, O
worn O
- O
out O
, O
almost O
dead O
, O
and O
all O
but O
buried O
uncle O
, O
whose O
demise O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
had O
led O
her O
daily S-DATE
or O
hourly O
to O
expect O
for O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
two I-DATE
years E-DATE

If O
his O
ghost O
had O
appeared O
, O
she O
would O
not O
have O
been O
half O
so O
much O
astonished O
, O
while O
he O
seemed O
evidently O
more O
amused O
than O
he O
chose O
to O
acknowledge O
, O
at O
having O
created O
such O
a O
sensation O
, O
which O
he O
was O
by O
no O
means O
inclined O
to O
diminish O
, O
while O
silently O
admiring O
the O
beautiful O
fluctuations O
of O
expression O
in O
Agnes' S-PERSON
resplendent O
eyes O
, O
fixed O
on O
himself O
with O
almost O
incredulous O
amazement O
. O
At O
length O
he O
rose O
to O
take O
leave O
, O
with O
a O
smiling O
, O
supercilious O
bow O
, O
and O
beckoned O
in O
an O
authoritative O
manner O
to O
a O
clerical O
- O
looking O
gentleman O
at O
some O
distance O
, O
to O
follow O
him O
, O
who O
spoke O
in O
a O
voice O
of O
almost O
feminine O
softness O
, O
though O
Agnes S-PERSON
thought O
the O
expression O
of O
his O
countenance O
peculiarly O
sinister O
and O
forbidding O
. O
" O
That O
, O
then O
, O
must O
be O
the B-PERSON
Abbe I-PERSON
Mordaunt E-PERSON
! O
" O
exclaimed O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
almost O
aloud O
, O
while O
she O
gazed O
at O
his O
stern O
, O
sallow O
countenance O
, O
his O
shaggy O
eyebrows O
, O
low O
forehead O
, O
and O
artful O
- O
looking O
smile O
. O
" O
He O
might O
act O
the O
villain O
in O
any O

I O
would O
rather O
not O
stand O
between O
that O
man O
and O
any O
earthly O
object O

may O
set O
his O
heart O
on O

He O
is O
the O
most O
Jesuitical O
- O
looking O
Jesuit O
I O
ever O
beheld O
! O
" O
Though O
Agnes' S-PERSON
first S-ORDINAL
recontre O
with O
the O
Marquis S-PERSON
of O
Doncaster S-GPE
had O
been O
so O
calamitous O
, O
and O
her O
first S-ORDINAL
prejudice O
against O
his O
shadow O
, O
the O
Abbe S-PERSON
, O
had O
seemed O
most O
inveterate O
, O
she O
yet O
spent O
much O
of O
her O
time O
for O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
few I-DATE
days E-DATE
in O
their O
society O
, O
and O
was O
delighted O
to O
engross O
the O
attention O
and O
the O
evident O
admiration O
of O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
most O
distinguished O
- O
looking O
personages O
at O
the O
ordinary O
, O
while O
, O
without O
scruple O
, O
she O
flattered O
the O
Marquis S-PERSON
most O
flagrantly O
, O
by O
laughing O
to O
excess O
at O
her O
own O
very O
mistaken O
ideas O
of O
him O
previous O
to O
their O
meeting O
, O
and O
hinting O
that O
this O
had O
rendered O
her O
subsequent O
surprise O
the O
more O
agreeable O
. O
Lord B-PERSON
Doncaster E-PERSON
in O
return O
amused O
himself O
with O
talking O
to O
her O
in O
a O
style O
suited O
to O
the O
female O
society O
in O
which O
most O
of O
his O
own O
time O
had O
hitherto O
been O
spent O
, O
though O
it O
should O
not O
certainly O
have O
suited O
any O
young O
girl O
educated O
like O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
who O
stretched O
her O
complaisance O
, O
however O
, O
to O
the O
utmost O
for O
a O
nobleman O
, O
and O
the O
uncle O
of O
her O
intended O
, O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
. O
Marion's S-PERSON
refined O
and O
delicate O
feelings O
shrunk O
at O
once O
from O
the O
libertine O
freedom O
of O
look O
and O
manner O
which O
she O
could O
not O
but O
observe O
in O
the O
old O
Marquis' S-PERSON
tone O
to O
ladies O
, O
and O
though O
he O
repeatedly O
tried O
to O
engage O
her O
in O
the O
flippant O
and O
almost O
dissolute O
conversation O
which O
, O
in O
a O
low O
lover O
- O
like O
tone O
, O
he O
addressed O
to O
her O
sister O
, O
and O
made O
an O
ostentatious O
display O
of O
his O
admiration O
for O
both O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
disgusted O
and O
shocked O
at O
what O
seemed O
so O
utterly O
unsuitable O
to O
his O
years O
, O
gently O
but O
decidedly O
evaded O
all O
intercourse O
, O
being O
of O
opinion O
that O
the O
coquetry O
which O
was O
dishonorable O
in O
the O
nephew O
, O
became O
ridiculous O
and O
contemptible O
in O
the O
uncle O
, O
therefore O
she O
behaved O
to O
him O
with O
distant O
politeness O
, O
and O
a O
degree O
of O
gravity O
by O
no O
means O
natural O
to O
her O
in O
general O
. O
Marion S-PERSON
devoted O
herself O
almost O
exclusively O
to O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
leading O
him O
about O
in O
his O
walks O
, O
and O
enlivening O
his O
conversation O
with O
old O
Captain O
Ogilvy S-PERSON
, O
while O
she O
could O
not O
but O
frequently O
compare O
the O
age O
and O
respectability O
of O
her O
venerable O
uncle O
, O
with O
the O
almost O
equal O
age O
and O
very O
opposite O
character O
of O
the B-PERSON
Roman I-PERSON
Catholic I-PERSON
Marquis E-PERSON
, O
whose O
thin O
skeleton O
figure O
, O
hollow O
ghost O
- O
like O
laugh O
and O
old O
stories O
, O
as O
broad O
as O
they O
were O
long O
, O
formed O
as O
unsuitable O
a O
contrast O
to O
his O
juvenile O
dress O
and O
manners O
, O
as O
his O
withered O
aspect O
did O
, O
to O
the O
fresh O
and O
fragrant O
flowers O
he O
constantly O
wore O
in O
his O
button O
- O
hole O
, O
and O
of O
which O
he O
lavished O
a O
splendid O
profusion O
on O
Agnes S-PERSON
. O
Marion S-PERSON
observed O
with O
increasing O
surprise O
and O
regret O
, O
that O
the O
lively O
persiflage O
of O
her O
sister O
with O
the O
Marquis S-PERSON
, O
was O
varied O
very O
frequently O
by O
long O
and O
apparently O
grave O
discussions O
, O
with O
the B-PERSON
Abbe I-PERSON
Mordaunt E-PERSON
, O
and O
at O
the B-DATE
end I-DATE
of I-DATE
a I-DATE
week E-DATE
, O
she O
became O
startled O
to O
observe O
that O
Agnes S-PERSON
wore O
round O
her O
neck O
a O
black O
ribbon O
, O
from O
which O
hung O
conspicuously O
suspended O
a O
large O
gold O
crucifix O
of O
very O
beautiful O
workmanship O
. O
On O
many O
former O
occasions O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
had O
found O
reason O
to O
dread O
the O
bitter O
vengeance O
of O
Agnes' S-PERSON
tongue O
, O
but O
at O
no O
loss O
to O
guess O
the O
source O
from O
whence O
this O
unusual O
ornament O
had O
been O
derived O
, O
she O
inwardly O
resolved O
not O
to O
let O
it O
pass O
unnoticed O
, O
but O
warmly O
to O
remonstrate O
with O
her O
sister O
on O
the O
growing O
influence O
of O
the O
Abbe S-PERSON
, O
which O
seemed O
surprising O
and O
unaccountable O
, O
while O
an O
undefined O
feeling O
of O
alarm O
respecting O
the O
rapidly O
increasing O
intimacy O
of O
Agnes S-PERSON
with O
Lord O
Doncaster S-PERSON
, O
caused O
her O
to O
long O
impatiently O
for O
the O
arrival O
of O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
, O
as O
she O
felt O
unwilling O
to O
distress O
her O
uncle O
on O
the O
subject O
of O
Agnes' S-PERSON
extraordinary O
conduct O
, O
trusting O
that O
the O
whole O
affair O
was O
a O
mere O
girlish O
whim O
— O
a O
piece O
of O
missyish O
coquetry O
to O
please O
Lord O
Doncaster S-PERSON
, O
who O
in O
the O
mean O
time O
laughingly O
boasted O
that O
never O
before O
had O
he O
made O
a O
proselyte O
so O
young O
and O
beautiful O
. O
CHAPTER O
XXX O
. O
" O
Patrick S-PERSON
, O
" O
exclaimed O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
hurrying O
into O
Sir O
Arthur's S-PERSON
sitting O
- O
room O
the O
morning O
after O
her O
brother's O
arrival O
at O
the O
Granby S-LOC
, O
while O
a O
brilliant O
color O
lighted O
up O
her O
cheek O
, O
and O
her O
eyes O
sparkled O
with O
animation O
, O
" O
Lord O
Wigton S-PERSON
is O
coming O
in O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes E-TIME
to O
hear O
me O
sing O
that O
new O
song O
of O
Bellini's S-PERSON
, O
therefore O
pray O
tell O
the O
waiters O
we O
are O
not O
at O
home O
to O
any O
living O
mortal O
, O
and O
do O
hold O
this O
music O
till O
I O
give O
a O
last O
touch O
to O
my O
ringlets O
. O
" O
Agnes S-PERSON
impatiently O
held O
out O
a O
large O
roll O
of O
paper O
, O
but O
almost O
screamed O
with O
astonishment O
on O
looking O
up O
, O
to O
perceive O
that O
she O
had O
addressed O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
, O
evidently O
that O
moment O
arrived O
from O
a O
long O
journey O
. O
" O
Good O
morning O
, O
Miss O
Dunbar S-PERSON
. O
We O
are O
well O
met O
! O
" O
said O
he O
, O
with O
rather O
satirical O
emphasis O
. O
" O
I O
am O
in O
a O
very O
cut O
-throat O
humor O
to O
- O
day O
, O
and O
shall O
certainly O
put O
an O
end O
to O
little O
Lord O
Wigton S-PERSON
! O
" O
" O
You O
have O
nearly O
put O
an O
end O
to O
me O
, O
" O
replied O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
unable O
to O
steady O
her O
voice O
| | O
" O
but O
I O
am O
rather O
glad O
to O
see O
you O
! O
Perhaps O
you O
may O
be O
allowed O
to O
remain O
here O
, O
though O
that O
tiresome O
man O
does O
so O
teaze O
me O
about O
singing O
. O
" O
" O
Wigton S-PERSON
told O
me O
he O
was O
coming O
to O
see O
, O
or O
rather O
to O
hear O
Marion S-PERSON
! O
" O
said O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
, O
emerging O
from O
a O
distant O
window O
. O
" O
To O
hear O
me O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
with O
unfeigned O
surprise O
and O
perplexity O
, O
while O
thunder O
and O
lightning O
both O
lowered O
on O
the O
forehead O
of O
her O
sister O
. O
" O
That O
must O
be O
a O
mistake O
! O
I O
heard O
nothing O
of O
any O
appointment O
, O
and O
have O
not O
had O
a O
minute's O
conversation O
with O
Lord O
Wigton S-PERSON
since O
we O
arrived O
at O
Harrowgate S-GPE
. O
He O
heard O
me O
only O
once O
by O
accident O
, O
and O
probably O
never O
will O
again O
. O
" O
" O
Unless O
by O
design O
! O
" O
whispered O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
angrily O
. O
" O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
you O
have O
certainly O
some O
underhand O
way O
of O
getting O
on O
with O
people O
, O
which O
baffles O
my O
comprehension O
! O
" O
Marion S-PERSON
turned O
away O
, O
and O
silently O
resumed O
her O
place O
beside O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
been O
amusing O
himself O
by O
standing O
at O
the O
window O
, O
while O
she O
told O
him O
what O
carriages O
came O
round O
to O
the O
door O
, O
what O
parties O
of O
pleasure O
were O
setting O
out O
or O
returning O
, O
and O
what O
travelling O
equipages O
appeared O
in O
sight O
, O
of O
which O
seldom O
fewer B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
ten E-CARDINAL
or O
twelve S-CARDINAL
arrived O
in O
a O
day O
| | O
and O
by O
ascertaining O
the O
coat O
- O
of O
- O
arms O
or O
coronets O
emblazoned O
on O
the O
panels O
, O
she O
sometimes O
formed O
a O
tolerable O
accurate O
guess O
who O
might O
probably O
be O
their O
occupants O
. O
After O
talking O
together O
with O
great O
vivacity O
for O
some O
time O
, O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
suddenly O
felt O
the O
arm O
of O
Marion S-PERSON
on O
which O
he O
was O
leaning O
, O
give O
an O
almost O
convulsive O
start O
, O
while O
she O
seemed O
with O
difficulty O
to O
suppress O
a O
half O
- O
uttered O
exclamation O
of O
delighted O
astonishment O
. O
She O
now O
leaned O
eagerly O
out O
of O
the O
window O
, O
to O
examine O
a O
travelling O
chariot O
which O
had O
driven O
up O
to O
the O
door O
, O
from O
whence O
a O
lady O
, O
apparently O
in O
the O
utmost O
extreme O
of O
weakness O
, O
was O
carefully O
supported O
out O
by O
a O
gentleman O
, O
and O
before O
another O
moment O
could O
elapse O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
had O
rushed O
down O
stairs O
, O
and O
was O
clasped O
in O
the O
arms O
of O
Clara B-PERSON
Granville E-PERSON
. O
" O
Did O
you O
get O
my O
letter O
? O
" O
exclaimed O
her O
friend O
, O
in O
feeble O
and O
agitated O
accents O
, O
while O
, O
after O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
rapturous O
greetings O
, O
they O
had O
retired O
alone O
into O
a O
sitting O
- O
room O
. O
" O
No O
! O
is O
that O
possible O
? O
How O
could O
the O
post O
have O
been O
so O
long O
delayed O
? O
But O
perhaps O
it O
may O
be O
as O
well O
, O
for O
there O
was O
grief O
as O
much O
as O
joy O
in O
it O
. O
" O
Marion S-PERSON

the O

had O
entirely O

not O

her O

there O
was O
a O
deep O

settled O
sadness O
in O

already O
read O

gazed O

whimsical O
old O
— O
, O

certainly O
not O
venerable O
relative O

Lord O
Doncaster S-PERSON

It O
seemed O
to O
him O
at O
first O
a O
laughable O
jest O
, O

before O
long O
he O
became O
struck O
by O
the O
increased O
coldness O
of O
his O
uncle's O
manner O
, O
which O
was O
, O
if O
possible O
, O
more O
cynical O

repulsive O
than O
ever O
, O
since O
the O
time O

Curiosity O
now O
induced O
Captain O

, O
in O
some O
degree O
, O
to O
resume O
that O
intimacy O

which O
he O
came O
intending O
entirely O

devoted O
to O
the O
captivation O

still O
more O
fascinating O

careless O
civility O

resolved O
apparently O

forget O
all O

pleasant O

sitting O

partly O
from O
bodily O

frankly O
, O

a O
bright O
color O
glowed O
on O
her O
cheek O

He O
cannot O
even O
understand O
one O

The O
whole O
pattern O
of O
his O

is O
egotism O
in O
all O
its O

you O

positively O
permit O
me O

my O
detestation O

the O

I O
allow O

" O
The O

very O

one O
to O

shocked O

If O
he O

any O

it O

Could O
any O

That O
seems O

impossible O

No O

The O
Abbe S-PERSON
always O
looks O
to O
me O
like O
a O
person O
who O
had O
something O
very O
heavy O
upon O

It O
was O
the O
power O

principle O
over O

caused O

reject O

with O
gentle O

the O

the O

Sir O

such O

that O
his O

she O
could O
not O
utterly O
hate O

though O
day O

she O

remembrance O
how O
unjustifiably O
her O

baneful O

pious O
resignation O

agonizing O
martyrdom O
of O
extinguishing O
from O

unknown O
hand O
, O
which O
she O
felt O
and O
knew O
must O
be O
sent O
by O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
, O
though O
it O
was O
an O
attention O
he O
had O
never O
shown O
to O
any O
other O

and O
the O
rarest O
fruit O
was O
frequently O
produced O
at O
her O
solitary O
dinner O
, O
though O
the O
waiter O
neither O
could O
nor O
would O
give O
any O
clear O
account O
of O
whence O
it O
came O
, O

not O
a O
day O
passed O

not O
see O
Sir O
Patrick's S-PERSON
graceful O
figure O
lounging O
beneath O
her O
windows O
, O
conversing O
in O
an O
animated O
tone O

with O
everybody O

himself O

galloping O
almost O

out O

Every B-TIME
evening E-TIME
Mr. O
Granville S-PERSON
urged O
upon O
his O
sister O
the O
importance O
of O
her O
being O
speedily O
conveyed O
to O
the O
continent O

but O
every O
morning O
Clara S-PERSON
postponed O
their O
preparations O
, O
feeling O
too O
much O
enfeebled O
for O
the O
journey O
, O
and O
unwilling O
to O
lose O
the O
delightful O
fascination O
of O
Marion's S-PERSON
society O
, O
who O
sat O
beside O
her O
couch O
all O
day O
, O
and O
every O
day O
, O
making O
hours O
seem O
like O
moments O
while O
they O
conversed O
together O
. O
Clara S-PERSON
knew O
nothing O
of O
ennui O
, O
and O
never O
had O
occasion O
to O
kill O
time O
, O
for O
she O
valued O
it O
as O
time O
ought O
to O
be O
valued O
, O
at O
an O
inestimable O
price O
. O
She O
had O
no O
weariness O
to O
dissipate O
, O
as O
every O
hour O
was O
occupied O
in O
improving O
her O
own O
mind O
and O
heart O
, O
while O
she O
exerted O
herself O
for O
the O
happiness O
of O

laid O
her O
head O
on O

she O

power O

the O
real O
advantage O

CHAPTER O
XXXII O
. O
Little O
of O
what O
is O
really O
going O
on O
in O
society O
can O
be O
traced O
on O
its O
gay O
, O
sparkling O
surface O
, O
where O
, O
amidst O
laughter O
, O
music O
, O
jesting O
, O
and O
smiles O
, O
a O
deep O
current O
may O
be O
flowing O
on O
of O
anger O
, O
envy O
, O
mortification O
, O
and O
disappointment O
. O
Agnes S-PERSON
had O
lately O
allowed O
herself O
to O
suspect O
that O
her O
preference O
for O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
was O
by O
no O
means O
mutual O
| | O
and O
though O
it O
still O
lingered O
in O
her O
mind O
, O
out O
- O
living O
all O
that O
coldness O
and O
caprice O
which O
had O
superseded O
the O
persevering O
ardor O
with O
which O
he O
once O
endeavored O
to O
engross O
her O
attention O
, O
the O
indignation O
of O
her O
feelings O
drove O
her O
now O
to O
seek O
relief O
in O
any O
counter O
- O
irritation O
, O
and O
especially O
in O
cultivating O
, O
beside O
Lord O
Doncaster S-PERSON
, O
the O
society O
where O
he O
was O
most O
depreciated O
, O
and O
where O
she O
heard O
many O
a O
story O
of O
him O
from O
the O
Abbe S-PERSON
, O
which O
filled O
her O
with O
angry O
misgivings O
. O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
now O
perceived O
, O
with O
almost O
bewildered O
astonishment O
, O
that O
the O
beautiful O
Agnes S-PERSON
remained O
stationary O
the O
whole O
evening O
with O
Lord O
Doncaster S-PERSON
, O
wishing O
, O
he O
conjectured O
, O
to O
propitiate O
the O
uncle O
as O
a O
preliminary O
to O
securing O
the O
nephew O
, O
and O
that O
she O
actually O
made O
him O
a O
secondary O
object O
in O
society O
, O
while O
it O
was O
evident O
the O
Marquis S-PERSON
observed O
and O
enjoyed O
this O
very O
visible O
alteration O
. O
It O
became O
particularly O
conspicuous O
at O
last O
, O
when O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
having O
spoken O
, O
one B-TIME
evening E-TIME
, O
a O
few O
words O
to O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
strolled O
away O
in O
momentary O
pique O
at O
the O
careless O
inattention O
of O
her O
reply O
, O
after O
which O
the O
vacant O
chair O
, O
beside O
her O
and O
Lord O
Doncaster S-PERSON
, O
was O
immediately O
occupied O
by O
the O
Abbe S-PERSON
, O
who O
talked O
down O
both O
his O
companions O
, O
while O
a O
long O
discussion O
ensued O
, O
of O
evidently O
deepening O
interest O
, O
during O
which O
the O
eyes O
of O
all O
three S-CARDINAL
were O
frequently O
directed O
towards O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
. O
Those O
of O
Agnes S-PERSON
now O
assumed O
an O
almost O
unnatural O
brightness O
, O
and O
her O
cheek O
became O
dyed O
with O
a O
hectic O
flush O
of O
excitement O
. O
Then O
, O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
, O
he O
perceived O
the O
gold O
crucifix O
which O
she O
held O
carelessly O
in O
her O
hand O
, O
while O
the O
Abbe S-PERSON
spoke O
with O
an O
air O
of O
artful O
and O
subdued O
earnestness O
, O
and O
Lord O
Doncaster S-PERSON
, O
looking O
like O
winter O
beside O
spring O
, O
watched O
, O
with O
evident O
admiration O
, O
the O
changes O
of O
color O
and O
expression O
which O
flitted O
like O
an O
aurora O
borealis O
on O
her O
beautiful O
features O
. O
It O
occurred O
to O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
, O
that O
his O
uncle O
, O
believing O
, O
perhaps O
, O
in O
some O
degree O
, O
the O
report O
of O
his O
marriage O
to O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
and O
being O
an O
enthusiastic O
admirer O
of O
beauty O
, O
might O
wish O
the O
Abbe S-PERSON
first S-ORDINAL
to O
convert O
the O
young O
lady O
to O
his O
own O
faith O
, O
before O
bestowing O
him O
upon O
her O
, O
and O
as O
the O
idea O
flitted O
through O
his O
mind O
, O
he O
smiled O
inwardly O
to O
think O
how O
they O
would O
all O
be O
disappointed O
. O
Still O
the O
ceaseless O
conversation O
continued O
, O
and O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
, O
apprehending O
it O
might O
never O
come O
to O
any O
particular O
end O
, O
resolved O

" O

" O
Agnes S-PERSON
seemed O
almost O
to O
awaken O
from O
a O
dream O
at O
these O
words O
, O
but O
, O
after O
a O
moment's O
evident O
perplexity O
, O
during O
which O
she O
assumed O
an O
air O
of O
dignified O
indecision O
, O
Lord O
Doncaster S-PERSON
having O
turned O
away O
to O
converse O
with O
Mrs. O
O'Donoghoe S-PERSON
, O
she O
slowly O
rose O
, O
and O
silently O
took O
her O
place O
in O
the O
dance O
. O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
had O
hitherto O
been O
to O
Agnes S-PERSON
like O
the O
sun O
to O
the O
dial O
, O
causing O
the O
lights O
and O
shadows O
of O
joy O
or O
anxiety O
to O
flit O
over O
her O
countenance O
according O
to O
his O
own O
pleasure O
, O
but O
now O
he O
became O
piqued O
and O
astonished O
to O
perceive O
that O
he O
could O
not O
even O
command O
her O
most O
transient O
attention O
, O
and O
with O
a O
satirical O
glance O
at O
her O
absent O
countenance O
, O
he O
emphatically O
exclaimed O
, O
" O
A O
delightful O
party O
this O
! O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
delightful O
! O
" O
echoed O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
mechanically O
. O
" O
And O
delightful O
music O
too O
! O
" O
added O
he O
, O
observing O
with O
increased O
surprise O
the O
total O
absence O
of O
her O
thoughts O
. O
" O
Delightful O
, O
indeed O
! O
" O
repeated O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
in O
an O
almost O
dreaming O
tone O
. O
" O
And O
what O
a O
delightful O
partner O
I O
have O
secured O
! O
" O
added O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
, O
with O
some O
asperity O
of O
tone O
, O
while O
gazing O
more O
and O
more O
curiously O
into O
her O
countenance O
. O
" O
I O
am O
so O
well O
pleased O
, O
that O
really O
it O
was O

facetious O

Your O
spirits O
are O
perfectly O
turbulent O

" O
" O
That O
is O
the O
more O
surprising O
, O
as O
I O
have O
done O
nothing O
this O
evening O
but O
yawn O
and O
be O
yawned O
at O
, O
" O
replied O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
resuming O
her O
gay O
, O
bantering O
tone O
. O
" O
I O
have O
been O

post O
, O
while O
you O
were O
generally O
so O
far O
off O

that O
I O
borrowed O
a O
good O
telescope O
at O

to O
try O
whether O
it O
might O
be O

" O
" O
I O
could O
not O
approach O
within O
a O
mile O
, O
you O
were O
so O
barricaded O
with O
Abbes S-PERSON

Marquises O
, O
but O
you O
of O
course O
occupied O

Shall O

ever O

my O
vexation O
on O
beholding O
my O
fossil O
specimen O
of O
an O
uncle O
depositing O
his O
bones O
in O
the O
very O
seat O
I O
intended O
for O
myself O

He O
is O
really O
becoming O
a O
formidable O
rival O
! O
" O
" O
Very O
true O
! O
" O
replied O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
forcing O
a O
laugh O
. O
" O
Lord O
Doncaster S-PERSON
is O
so O
agreeable O

use O
the O

him O
so O

It O

little O
to O
spare O

" O
I O
am O
very O
certain O

the O
old O

were O
ninety B-DATE

younger O
, O
he O
would O
make O
you O

certainly O
marriage O

a O
juvenile O
indiscretion O

replied O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
laughing O
, O
though O
she O
became O
agitated O
to O
the O
very O
tips O
of O
her O
fingers O
, O
while O
, O
trying O
not O
to O
seem O
embarrassed O
, O
she O
hastily O
drew O
her O
gloves O
on O
and O
off O
, O
adjusted O
her O
necklace O
, O
and O
betrayed O
, O
by O
other O
nervous O
manœuvres O
, O
that O
her O
mind O
was O
not O
quite O
at O
ease O
under O
the O
observant O
eye O
of O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
, O
who O
looked O
at O
her O
with O
satirical O
surprise O
, O

at O
last O
exclaimed O
, O
in O
accents O
of O
wonder O

" O

my O
bridle O

asked O
Agnes S-PERSON
eagerly O

" O
Another O
Duke O

some O
sixpenny O

how O
he O
stares O
at O
you O

I O
declare O
that O
look O

pin O
me O

the O

" O
" O
It O
is O
rather O
odd O
! O
Surely O
I O
have O
seen O
that O
man O
somewhere O
before O

He O
must O
have O
dressed O
my O
hair O
at O
Brighton S-GPE

measured O
me O
for O
a O
coat O

is O
probably O
now O
the O
sort O
of O

about O

by O

, O
if O

so O

I O

At O

round O

Granby S-LOC

while O
in O
the O
clear O

it O
could O
only O

obscurity O
the O
most O
penetrating O
eye O
could O
not O
discover O
who O

alighted O

A O
torrent O
of O
waiters O
streamed O
along O

a O
noisy O
outcry O

summoning O
the O
landlady O

bell O

the O
house O

ringing O
simultaneously O

Captain O
De B-PERSON

surprised O

the O
dark O

Mr. O

known O

that O
there O
were O

two S-CARDINAL

round O

varied O
by O
a O
scanty O
sprinkling O
of O
ladies O

The O
table O
was O
covered O
with O
wine O
glasses O

crystal O
decanters O
enough O

fill O

half S-CARDINAL

his O
plate O

each O
lady O
a O
glass O

her O

The O
uproar O
of O
waiters O

plates O

tongues O
, O
and O
glasses O
had O
subsided O

the O
conversation O
was O
at O
so O
low O
an O
ebb O
, O
that O
there O
seemed O
every O
probability O
of O
the O
whole O
party O
being O
found O
asleep O
in O
their O
chairs O
next B-TIME
morning E-TIME

when O
suddenly O
their O
attention O

a O

few O

such O

hung O
in O
wild O
profusion O
over O
his O
head O

There O
was O
an O
extraordinary O
wildness O

almost O
amounting O
to O
ferocity O

in O
his O

had O
the O
restless O
glare O
of O

wild O
beast's O

as O
he O
quickly O
glanced O
round O
the O
table O
, O
while O
his O
pale O
haggard O
features O
, O
and O
the O
strong O
compression O
of O
his O
upper O
lip O
, O
gave O
him O
an O
air O

along O
with O
a O
look O

flustered O

if O

the O
apparition O
could O
scarcely O

cut O
himself O

CHAPTER O
XXXIII O
. O
Marion S-PERSON
and O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
were O
engaged O
next B-TIME
morning E-TIME
to O
meet O
the O
Granvilles S-PERSON
at O
breakfast O
in O
the O
private O
parlor O
of O
Mrs. O
Crawford S-PERSON
, O
and O
they O
had O
advanced O
considerably O
in O
the O
consumption O
of O
their O
muffin O
and O
first S-ORDINAL
cup O
of O
tea O
, O
when O
a O
very O
plainly O
dressed O
young O
lady O
glided O
into O
the O
room O
with O
a O
timid O
, O
agitated O
step O
, O
and O
giving O
a O
slight O
nod O
to O
the O
party O
, O
silently O
seated O
herself O
beside O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
who O
, O
in O
compassion O
to O
her O
apparent O
shyness O
, O
averted O
her O
eyes O
. O
She O
seemed O
recently O
recovered O
from O
an O
illness O
, O
being O
thin O
and O
emaciated O
to O
excess O
, O
while O
it O
appeared O
as O
if O
her O
hair O
had O
been O
entirely O
shaved O
off O
, O
as O
she O
wore O
a O
cap O
fitting O
close O
to O
her O
face O
, O
and O
neither O
curl O
nor O
braid O
to O
vary O
the O
almost O
spectral O
whiteness O
of O
her O
whole O
aspect O
. O
Marion S-PERSON
ventured O
a O
second S-ORDINAL
glance O
at O
the O
interesting O
invalid O
, O
and O
observed O
a O
smile O
quivering O
about O
her O
mouth O
, O
which O
she O
seemed O
vainly O
endeavoring O
to O
suppress O
, O
and O
a O
sly O
glance O
towards O
herself O
, O
which O
enlightened O
her O
in O
a O
moment O
, O
for O
, O
with O
an O
exclamation O
of O
joy O
, O
she O
sprang O
from O
her O
seat O
and O
was O
instantly O
embraced O
, O
with O
laughing O
delight O
, O
by O
her O
old O
friend O
Caroline S-PERSON
, O
whom O
she O
had O
lately O
learned O
to O
know O
as O
Miss O
Howard S-PERSON
, O
the O
heiress O
of O
countless B-CARDINAL
thousands E-CARDINAL

— O
not O
the O
more O
, O
nor O
the O
less O
dear O

her O

that O
account O

still O
the O
beloved O
companion O
of O
all O
her O
early O
frolics O

school O
enjoyments O

powers O

recognition O

Caroline S-PERSON

with O
tears O
of O
laughing O

almost O
hysterical O
joy O
. O
" O
I O
am O
changed O

greatly O
changed O

so O
that O
my O

scarcely O
recognise O
me O

am O
still O
pursued O

persecuted O
by O
that O
wretched O
madman O

the O
terror O
of O
our O
school O
days O

the O
horror O
of O
all O
my O
subsequent O
life O

aunt O
finds O
her O

so O
shattered O

whole O
affair O

undertaken O

for O
a B-DATE

the O
crowd O
collected O
at O
Harrowgate S-FAC
, O
I O
may O
be O
in O
comparative O
safety O

My O
life O
has O
been O
rendered O
almost O
a O
burden O
to O
me O
in O
the O
country O

not O

corner O
of O

earth O
seemed O
safe O
from O
that O
wretched O
creature's O
intrusions O

it O
is O
thought O
that O

must O
bribe O
some O
of O
our O
servants O
to O
betray O
all O
my O
plans O

deeply O
read O

existed O
near O
Harrowgate S-GPE

come O
under O
consideration O
, O
Mr. O

at O
great O
length O
what O

he O
had O
paid O
to O
it O
many B-DATE

recounted O
several O
almost O
traditionary O
anecdotes O
of O
former O
times O

the O
names O
of O
Lord B-PERSON

the B-PERSON
Abbe I-PERSON
Mordaunt E-PERSON
, O
became O
almost O
insensibly O
blended O
, O
very O
much O
to O
their O
discredit O
, O
while O
Marion S-PERSON
reflected O
with O
wonder O

regret O
that O
such O
men O
were O
frequently O
now O
the O
chosen O
attendants O
of O
her O
own O
young O

beautiful O
sister O

was O
degradation O

in O
their O
looks O
, O

still O
more O
in O
their O
conversation O

she O
hoped O

trusted O

believed O
that O

would O
be O
terminated O
when O
Agnes S-PERSON
discovered O
that O

not O

to O
influence O
those O
of O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON

Mr. O

mentioned O
with O
peculiar O

melancholy O
interest O
the O
very O
beautiful O
niece O
of O
the B-PERSON
Abbe I-PERSON
Mordaunt E-PERSON
, O
whom O
it O
was O
evident O
that O
he O
had O
intimately O
known O
, O

very O
greatly O
admired O

he O
awakened O
the O
keenest O
interest O
in O
Marion S-PERSON

Miss O
Howard S-PERSON

by O
alluding O
to O
an O
abortive O
attempt O
he O
had O
made O
at O
Beaujolie B-FAC
Castle E-FAC
, O
to O
take O
a O
last O
leave O
of O
Miss O
Mordaunt S-PERSON

after O
she O
had O
been O
beguiled O
into O
forsaking O
the O
faith O
of O
her O
fathers O
, O
and O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
on O
the O
point O
of O
retiring O
within O
the O
walls O
of O
a O
convent O
. O
Marion S-PERSON
could O
not O
but O
smile O
at O
the O
description O
given O
by O
Mr. O

, O
of O
his O
first S-ORDINAL
and O
last O
visit O
to O
Lord B-PERSON

called O
at O
Beaujolie B-FAC

sixteen B-DATE
years I-DATE
before E-DATE

at O
which O
time O
the O
aged O
peer O
, O
though O
leading O
a O
life O
of O
retirement O
, O
made O
it O
by O
no O
means O
a O
life O
of O
solitude O
, O
as O
the O
vices O
of O
his O
early O
years O
enslaved O
him O
then O
as O
they O
enslaved O
him O
still O
, O
and O
the O
libertine O
of O
fifty B-DATE
years E-DATE
then O
, O
was O
a O
libertine O
now O
, O
when O
tottering O
on O
the O
brink O
of O
death O
. O
It O
became O
evident O
that O
the O
proprietor O
of O
Beaujolie B-FAC
Castle E-FAC
, O
though O
a O
great O
lord O
, O
was O
by O
no O
means O
in O
any O
respect O
a O
great O
man O
, O
being O
penurious O
in O
everything O

the O
indulgence O
of O
his O
own O
vices O
and O
superstition O

" O
It O
makes O
me O
shiver O
yet O
, O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Crawford S-PERSON
, O
" O
to O
remember O
the O
large O
cold O
hall O
, O
paved O
with O
a O
curious O
mosaic O
of O
black O
and O
white O
marble O

and O
the O
chilling O
, O
uninhabited O
room O

I O
was O

never O
at O
that O
time O
associated O
with O
any O
living O
individual O

his O
own O
rank O
in O
life O

Those O
who O
do O
not O
cultivate O
good O
society O
, O
are O
always O
in O
bad O

and O
it O
was O
supposed O
that O
he O
had O
strong O
reasons O
against O
admitting O
any O
one O
to O
his O
residence O
. O
The O
drawing O
- O
room O
was O
like O
a O
lantern O
with O
windows O
on O
every O
side O
, O
the O
floor O
so O
polished O
that O
it O
might O
have O
taken O
fire O
from O
the O
perpetual O
friction O
, O
and O
a O
scanty O
Turkish S-NORP
carpet O
served O
but O
to O
cover O
half S-CARDINAL
the O
slippery O
floor O
. O
" O
" O
I O
always O
wish O
, O
in O
such O
a O
room O
, O
to O
be O
rough O
- O
shod O

" O
said O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
" O
or O
to O
wear O
skates O

" O
" O
You O
will O
remember O
, O
Miss O
Howard S-PERSON

that O
no O
foot O
was O
ever O
allowed O
by O
your O
uncle O

its O
icy O
surface O

continued O
Mr. O
Crawford S-PERSON
, O
smiling O
. O
" O
But O
pathways O
of O
green O
baize O
were O
laid O
along O
the O
floor O
in O
every O
possible O
direction O

where O
it O
could O
be O
supposed O

A O
broad O
line O
stretched O
from O
the O
door O
to O
the O
fire O

place O
, O

tributary O
streams O
of O

branched O
off O
towards O

one S-CARDINAL

narrower O

asked O
Marion S-PERSON

threats O

prosecution O

up O

case O

trespass O

" O
" O
No O

I O
certainly O

a O
lady O

the O
most O
beautiful O
boy O

ever O

bright O

radiant O

When O
I O
called O
him O
forward O

he O
laughingly O
disappeared O

no O

whether O

Caroline S-PERSON

" O
Whenever O
I O
hear O

the O

it O
always O
seemed O
as O
if O

itself O

he O
valiantly O
persevered O

daily S-DATE

his O

saying O
that O
what O

good O

many O

would O
be O
good O
for O
his O

For O
nearly B-TIME
an I-TIME

, O
irritable O
glances O
upwards O
on O
the O
silent O
walls O
, O
yet O
keeping O
himself O
so O
concealed O
that O
no O
one O
, O
looking O
suddenly O
out O
, O
could O
have O
perceived O
him O
lurking O
there O
. O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
now O
, O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
, O
suspected O
that O
he O
did O
not O
belong O
to O
the O
party O
within O
, O
and O
became O
more O
and O
more O
interested O
in O
observing O
his O
various O
eccentric O
movements O
, O
which O
betrayed O
a O
high O
state O
of O
excitement O
, O
till O
at O
length O
, O
finding O
himself O
watched O
, O
with O
the O
quickness O
of O
lightning O
he O
suddenly O
vanished O
round O
a O
projecting O
corner O
of O
the O
building O
, O
though O
a O
few O
moments O
afterwards O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
perceived O
that O
he O
was O
concealed O
in O
a O
thicket O
of O
trees O
not O
far O
off O
, O
where O
he O
could O
still O
keep O
his O
eye O
fastened O
on O
the O
windows O
with O
unswerving O
steadiness O
. O
Parties O
, O
meantime O
, O
hurried O
onwards O
to O
Low O
Harrowgate O
to O
do O
duty O
at O
the O
well O
, O
while O
some O
of O
the O
loungers O
had O
already O
returned O
, O
being O
full O
charged O
with O
their O
quantum O
of O
water O
, O
and O
all O
very O
loudly O
expressing O
their O
astonishment O
that O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
had O
not O
yet O
set O
forth O
to O
hear O
the O
military O
band O
, O
which O
was O
reported O
to O
be O
playing O
" O
beautifully O
! O
enchantingly O
! O
or O
detestably O
! O
" O
according O
to O
the O
humor O
of O
those O
who O
spoke O
. O
The O
crowd O
was O
on O
this O
day O
so O
excessive O
, O
that O
the O
old O
well O
had O
been O
completely O
exhausted O
, O
and O
alarming O
apprehensions O
were O
entertained O
by O
the O
invalids O
, O
of O
a O
scarcity O
for O
the O
later O
visitors O
, O
but O
still O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
stirred O
not O
! O
Though O
not O
usually O
endowed O
with O
excessive O
interest O
in O
any O
affairs O
but O
his O
own O
, O
the O
movements O
of O
the O
mysterious O
stranger O
, O
and O
his O
look O
of O
feverish O
anxiety O
, O
engrossed O
almost O
the O
whole O
of O
Sir O
Patrick's S-PERSON
thoughts O
, O
though O
, O
to O
avoid O
any O
appearance O
of O
espionage O
, O
he O
kept O
up O
a O
lively O
dialogue O
with O
Mrs. O
O'Donoghoe S-PERSON
and O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
. O
Marion S-PERSON
in O
the O
mean O
time O
had O
been O
exceedingly O
amused O
by O
the O
scene O
which O
usually O
takes O
place O
at O
the O
well O
, O
where O
every O
face O
seemed O
as O
if O
laboring O
under O
the O
nausea O
of O
sea-sickness O
, O
and O
she O
stood O
for O
some O
time O
with O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
and O
Mr. O
Granville S-PERSON
, O
laughingly O
studying O
physiognomy O
, O
as O
parties O
arrived O
in O
rapid O
succession O
, O
threw O
off O
a O
tumbler O
of O
smoking O
horrors O
, O
and O
instantly O
departed O
, O
while O
a O
row O
of O
shabbily O
- O
dressed O
women O
, O
standing O
behind O
a O
stone O
counter O
, O
hurriedly O
filled O
the O
glasses O
, O
and O
handed O
them O
over O
in O
a O
long O
wooden O
ladle O
, O
to O
the O
expectant O
invalids O
, O
one S-CARDINAL
by O
one O
, O
who O
were O
waiting O
patiently O
or O
impatiently O
for O
their O
turn O
. O
Each O
of O
the O
great O
hotels O
had O
an O
emissary O
appointed O
here O
, O
whose O
business O
it O
was O
to O
attend O
on O
their O
respective O
guests O
with O
the O
proper O
allowance O
of O
water O
, O
and O
it O
seemed O
as O
if O
these O
old O
women O
knew O
by O
a O
sort O
of O
instinct O
those O
who O
belonged O
to O
their O
own O
house O
| | O
but O
an O
angry O
contest O
having O
taken O
place O
respecting O
one S-CARDINAL
gentleman O
, O
who O
was O
obliged O
to O
wait O
with O
resignation O
or O
without O
it O
, O
till O
the O
belligerent O
parties O
had O
decided O
whose O
privilege O
it O
was O
to O
kill O
or O
cure O
him O
, O
Marion's S-PERSON
attention O
was O
more O
peculiarly O
attracted O
to O
the O
spot O
, O
where O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
women O
who O
assisted O
in O
serving O
out O
the O
general O
beverage O
had O
been O
hitherto O
screened O
from O
her O
notice O
. O
Her O
face O
was O
excessively O
muffled O
up O
, O
but O
in O
the O
little O
that O
remained O
visible O
, O
traces O
of O
beauty O
still O
remained O
, O
though O
her O
features O
were O
so O
attuned O
to O
suffering O
, O
that O
Marion S-PERSON
with O
wonder O
and O
pity O
contemplated O
so O
pale O
and O
ghastly O
a O
form O
. O
At O
length O
a O
dim O
idea O
stole O
into O
her O
mind O
, O
that O
surely O
she O
had O
seen O
that O
face O
before O
, O
but O
while O
the O
floating O
remembrance O
yet O
continued O
to O
flicker O
indistinctly O
through O
her O
mind O
, O
the O
wretched O
- O
looking O
woman O
, O
with O
a O
startled O
glance O
, O
had O
vanished O
. O
" O
Patrick S-PERSON
! O
" O
whispered O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
turning O
to O
take O
her O
brother's O
arm O
, O
" O
do O
patronize O
me O
for O
one B-TIME
minute E-TIME
! O
Did O
you O
observe O
that O
melancholy O
- O
looking O
woman O
at O
the O
well O
? O
I O
never O
saw O
so O
blighted O
a O
countenance O
! O
What O
can O
the O
sorrows O
be O
that O
stamped O
such O
a O
look O
of O
ghastly O
woe O
upon O
these O
beautiful O
features O
? O
" O
Marion S-PERSON
looked O
up O
for O
a O
reply O
, O
and O
started O
to O
find O
that O
she O
had O
inadvertently O
taken O
the O
arm O
of O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
, O
whose O
usual O
vivacity O
and O
presence O
of O
mind O
seemed O
at O
this O
moment O
to O
have O
entirely O
forsaken O
him O
. O
His O
eyes O
were O
straining O
after O
the O
receding O
figure O
of O
the O
stranger O
, O
with O
an O
air O
of O
eager O
astonishment O
and O
alarm O
, O
while O
his O
countenance O
had O
become O
white O
as O
death O
. O
In O
a O
moment O
, O
however O
, O
he O
recovered O
himself O
, O
when O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
with O
an O
exclamation O
of O
surprise O
, O
had O
drawn O
away O
her O
hand O
, O
making O
a O
hurried O
apology O
for O
her O
mistake O
. O
" O
Did O
you O
not O
recognise O
her O
? O
" O
asked O
he O
, O
in O
accents O
of O
almost O
tremulous O
agitation O
. O
" O
It O
could O
be O
no O
one O
else O
! O
Surely O
that O
must O
have O
been O
— O
Dixon S-PERSON
? O
" O
" O
It O
was O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
breathlessly O
. O
" O
How O
has O
she O
come O
here O
? O
what O
can O
she O
want O
? O
where O
is O
Agnes S-PERSON
? O
" O
" O
This O
must O
be O
inquired O
into O
! O
" O
muttered O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
, O
almost O
inaudibly O
| | O
and O
then O
resuming O
his O
usual O
careless O
vivacity O
of O
tone O
and O
manner O
, O
he O
entreated O
Marion S-PERSON
to O
let O
him O
benefit O
by O
the O
fortunate O
resemblance O
of O
his O
dress O
to O
Sir O
Patrick's S-PERSON
, O
and O
still O
continue O
to O
escort O
her O
. O
" O
I O
envy O
Dunbar S-PERSON
for O
the O
privilege O
whenever O
he O
enjoys O
it O
, O
for O
you O
shun O
me O
like O
a O
rattle O
- O
snake O
, O
" O
added O
he O
, O
in O
his O
most O
insinuating O
tone O
| | O
" O
yet O
I O
would O
not O
for O
worlds O
be O
your O
brother O
. O
" O
" O
It O
is O
but O
a O
troublesome O
office O
, O
" O
replied O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
looking O
anxiously O
round O
for O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
walked O
on O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes E-TIME
before O
, O
leaning O
on O
Mr. O
Granville S-PERSON
, O
and O
most O
impatiently O
did O
she O
long O
for O
their O
return O
, O
being O
always O
on O
the O
alert O
to O
shun O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
without O
appearing O
to O
do O
so O
. O
Though O
, O
like O
all O
other O
persons O
, O
amused O
and O
enlivened O
by O
his O
whimsical O
and O
diverting O
style O
of O
conversation O
, O
which O
had O
more O
even O
in O
the O
manner O
than O
in O
the O
words O
, O
and O
though O
with O
any O
friend O
of O
her O
brother's O
it O
pained O
her O
courteous O
nature O
to O
be O
otherwise O
than O
frank O
and O
good O
humored O
, O
yet O
she O
made O
a O
principle O
of O
unobtrusively O
evading O
his O
assiduities O
, O
not O
only O
because O
his O
conduct O
to O
Agnes S-PERSON
had O
been O
and O
still O
continued O
unpardonably O
dishonorable O
, O
but O
she O
felt O
indignant O
to O
think O
that O
he O
was O
disposed O
to O
beguile O
his O
leisure O
by O
also O
captivating O
and O
deluding O
herself O
. O
It O
was O
obvious O
that O
whenever O
she O
entered O
the O
room O
, O
he O
became O
silent O
and O
embarrassed O
with O
every O
one O
else O
, O
and O
took O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
opportunity O
of O
devoting O
himself O
exclusively O
to O
her O
. O
Not O
giving O
one S-CARDINAL
shadow O
of O
belief O
to O
all O
his O
professions O
, O
when O
Marion S-PERSON
was O
obliged O
to O
listen O
, O
she O
did O
so O
with O
unconcealed O
indignation O
on O
finding O
the O
same O
insinuations O
of O
attachment O
made O
to O
herself O
which O
had O
been O
repeated O
to O
her O
formerly O
with O
triumphant O
credulity O
by O
Agnes S-PERSON
. O
Marion S-PERSON
thoroughly O
despised O
his O
double O
dealing O
and O
ungenerous O
trifling O
, O
while O
feeling O
nothing O
for O
him O
on O
that O
score O
but O
contempt O
, O
she O
could O
almost O
have O
rejoiced O
that O
he O
wasted O
his O
efforts O
to O
be O
irresistible O
on O
one O
who O
, O
being O
so O
fully O
aware O
of O
his O
character O
, O
could O
incur O
no O
danger O
from O
the O
fascinations O
which O
had O
been O
fatal O
to O
the O
peace O
of O
many O
. O
Safe O
in O
the O
consciousness O
of O
a O
hallowed O
attachment O
to O
Mr. O
Granville S-PERSON
, O
and O
convinced O
that O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
was O
incapable O
of O
a O
single O
genuine O
feeling O
, O
she O
could O
scarcely O
have O
considered O
it O
necessary O
even O
to O
be O
repulsive O
in O
her O
manner O
| | O
but O
it O
seemed O
due O
to O
Agnes S-PERSON
as O
much O
as O
possible O
to O
avoid O
him O
, O
knowing O
that O
her O
sister O
had O
not O
yet O
been O
able O
entirely O
to O
divest O
herself O
of O
a O
lingering O
belief O
that O
the O
professions O
which O
were O
false O
to O
all O
others O
were O
sincere O
to O
herself O
. O
For O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
in O
his O
whole O
acquaintance O
with O
lady O
- O
kind O
, O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
felt O
doubtful O
and O
diffident O
of O
his O
own O
fascinations O
, O
and O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
also O
he O
felt O
himself O
really O
and O
undeniably O
in O
love O
, O
as O
the O
transparent O
single O
- O
hearted O
excellence O
of O
Marion's S-PERSON
character O
seemed O
, O
when O
compared O
with O
the O
hackneyed O
and O
artificial O
mind O
of O
her O
sister O
, O
and O
all O
other O
girls O
, O
like O
the O
difference O
between O
a O
pure O
mountain O
breeze O
and O
a O
London S-GPE
fog O
. O
The O
attachment O
he O
so O
often O
affected O
had O
now O
become O
genuine O
, O
and O
the O
feelings O
he O
formerly O
invented O
for O
amusement O
, O
and O
expressed O
with O
the O
utmost O
fluency O
, O
were O
now O
so O
real O
, O
that O
they O
could O
scarcely O
be O
spoken O
at O
all O

for O
language O
seemed O
to O
fail O
him O
when O
he O
addressed O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
and O
every O
day O
, O
as O
it O
increased O
his O
attachment O
, O
diminished O
his O
hope O
. O
She O
had O
no O
vulgar O
love O
of O
admiration O

and O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
was O
mortified O
to O
perceive O

that O

the O

at O
the O

this O

, O
more O
than O

pleasure O

regretting O
the O
most O
trifling O
annoyance O
that O
fell O
in O
her O
way O
, O
approving O
of O
all O
her O

talking O
in O

said O

rushing O
eagerly O
forward O
to O
pick O
up O
a O

blown O
out O
of O

" O

I O
keep O
this O
rose O
? O
" O
" O
Certainly O
! O
any O
gentleman O
may O
take O
a O
flower O

I O
never O
give O

are O
twenty S-CARDINAL

" O
" O
I O
would O
give O
all O
the O
twenty S-CARDINAL

this O
one O

This O
is O
more O
precious O
than O
anything O

the O
hand O
that O
gives O
it O

answered O
Marion S-PERSON

indifferently O
. O
" O
That O

withered O

still O
it O
would O
be O

connected O

I O
shall O
cherish O

, O
for O
my O
especial O

give O
us O
a O
few O
stitches O

" O
" O
It O
must O
be O
his O
fault O

kept O
so O
very O
long O
together O

Marion S-PERSON

impatiently O
. O
" O
You O
are O
aware O
already O

Captain O
De B-PERSON

that O
I O
must O
receive O
all O
my O

civility O

that O

as O
it O
is O
of O
no O

the O
wind O

if O
you O
consider O
me O
indifferent O

that O
is O
what O

distracting O
! O
Let O
me O
acknowledge O
, O
Miss O

, O
that O
I O
may O
have O
deceived O
others O

you O
I O
never O

others O

have O
flattered O
, O
but O
no O
one O
can O
flatter O
you O

because O
nothing O
can O
be O
said O
equal O
to O
what O
I O

I O
wish O
new O
words O
could O
be O
invented O

express O
the O
ardor O

sentiments O
! O

neither O
past O

what O

said O
Captain O

, O
with O
hurried O
impetuosity O
, O
while O
a O
rush O
of O
mingled O
feeling O
swept O
across O
his O
features O

The O
world O
, O
in O
short O

has O
only O
two S-CARDINAL
divisions O

in O
my O
estimation O
— O
where O
you O

my O

the O
very O
heart O

Marion S-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
low O
, O
tremulous O
voice O

for O
there O
was O
an O
irresistible O
air O
of O
truth O
in O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny's E-PERSON
manner O

startled O

shocked O
her O

Miss O

CHAPTER O
XXXV O
. O
Marion S-PERSON
had O
frequently O
sketched O
in O
her O
own O
mind O
a O
faint O
outline O
of O
what O
she O
should O
say O
to O
Agnes S-PERSON
on O
the O
subject O
of O
her O
unaccountable O
intimacy O
with O
Lord O
Doncaster S-PERSON
, O
who O
seemed O
to O
delight O
in O
making O
a O
parade O
of O
her O
preference O
for O
his O
society O
, O
especially O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
his O
nephew O
| | O
but O
when O
Marion S-PERSON
found O
herself O
at O
length O
alone O
one B-DATE
day E-DATE
with O
her O
sister O
, O
she O
felt O
her O
heart O
sink O
with O
apprehension O
, O
yet O
, O
being O
resolved O
to O
conquer O
nature O
, O
and O
do O
her O
duty O
, O
if O
possible O
, O
she O
approached O
the O
table O
where O
Agnes S-PERSON
was O
seated O
. O
A O
large O
, O
foreign O
- O
looking O
book O
, O
with O
gold O
clasps O
, O
lay O
conspicuously O
before O
her O
, O
which O
Marion S-PERSON
discovered O
at O
once O
to O
be O
a O
missal O
, O
bound O
in O
antique O
boards O
of O
beautifully O
inlaid O
wood O
, O
with O
massy O
gilt O
ornaments O
, O
and O
illuminated O
by O
designs O
in O
the O
style O
of O
Albert B-PERSON
Durer E-PERSON
. O
To O
hide O
her O
confusion O
, O
and O
begin O
the O
subject O
with O
advantage O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
placed O
her O
hand O
on O
the O
shoulder O
of O
Agnes S-PERSON
for O
some O
moments O
, O
and O
leaned O
forward O
, O
examining O
those O
splendid O
paintings O
, O
the O
singular O
beauty O
of O
which O
she O
admired O
, O
while O
expressing O
considerable O
amazement O
at O
the O
strange O
, O
distorted O
designs O
on O
the O
border O
, O
where O
animals O
with O
five S-CARDINAL
heads O
and O
their O
faces O
all O
nose O
, O
were O
varied O
with O
fish O
mounted O
on O
legs O
, O
and O
birds O
exhibiting O
human O
countenances O
. O
" O
These O
eccentric O
creatures O
resemble O
the O
figures O
in O
some O
horrible O
dream O
! O
" O
observed O
Marion S-PERSON
| | O
" O
but O
they O
are O
not O
a O
greater O
distortion O
from O
the O
truth O
of O
nature O
, O
than O
the O
Popish O
superstitions O
which O
they O
illustrate O
are O
from O
the O
truth O
of O
revelation O
. O
Nothing O
seems O
left O
in O
either O
, O
of O
the O
perfect O
symmetry O
with O
which O
all O
things O
come O
from O
a O
Divine O
Creator O
. O
" O
" O
I O
am O
no O
controversialist O
, O
" O
said O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
indifferently O
. O
" O
I O
take O
matters O
as O
I O
find O
them O
. O
" O
" O
That O
is O
not O
the O
safest O
of O
all O
plans O
, O
unless O
you O
are O
very O
careful O
from O
whom O
your O
ideas O
are O
received O
. O
I O
have O
heard O
that O
there O
are O
writers O
in O
the B-ORG
Roman I-ORG
Catholic I-ORG
Church E-ORG
, O
such O
as O
Massillon S-GPE
, O
Pascal S-PERSON
, O
and O
Fenelon S-PERSON
, O
who O
were O
nearly O
as O
pure O
in O
Christian S-NORP
doctrine O
as O
ourselves O
, O
resting O
their O
hope O
on O
no O
merits O
except O
those O
of O
our O
Divine O
Saviour O

but O
I O
should O
think O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
that O
no O
Protestant S-NORP
could O
gain O
anything O
from O
associating O
with O
such O
a O
man O
as O
the B-PERSON
Abbe I-PERSON
Mordaunt E-PERSON
, O
who O
would O
disgrace O
any O
church O
. O
Dear O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
allow O
me O
for O
this O
once O
the O
privilege O
of O
a O
sister O

not O
merely O
to O
love O
you O
with O
my O
whole O
heart O
, O
as O
I O
always O
do O
, O

also O
to O
prove O
my O
affection O
by O
saying O
for O
your O
sake O
what O
is O
most O
painful O
to O
me O
, O
and O
may O
probably O
be O
annoying O
to O
you O

It O
is O
with O
the O
greatest O
anxiety O

surprise O
that O

lately O
been O
watching O
you O

Agnes S-PERSON

starting O
round O
with O
angry O
asperity O

fixing O
her O
flashing O
eyes O
on O
Marion S-PERSON

" O

Marion S-PERSON

with O
emotion O
, O
while O
a O
large O
tear O
glittered O
in O
her O
deep O
blue O
eyes O

are O
motherless O

greater O
solicitude O

many O
eyes O

with O
a O
flickering O
color O
in O

was O
no O

a O

reached O
him O

a O
Miss O

was O
expected O
at O
Harrowgate S-GPE

and O
a O
horrible O
apprehension O
crossed O
his O
mind O
that O
, O
young O
as O
she O
looked O
, O
this O
might O
actually O
be O
the O
culprit O

he O
could O
not O

whisper O
to O
the O
laughing O
widow O

adding O
, O
with O
a O
look O
of O
comical O
consternation O

said O
to O
be O
not O
only O
very O
rich O

very O
plain O

therefore O
as O
people O
generally O

we O
shall O
suit O
exactly O

" O
The O
timid O
young O
lady O
had O
now O
fallen O
into O
a O
perfect O
paroxysm O
of O
blushes O
, O
and O
an O
extraordinary O
twitching O
about O
her O
mouth O
betrayed O
the O
last O
extreme O
of O
nervousness O
, O
though O
whether O
her O
agitation O
were O
not O
of O
a O
risible O
nature O
, O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
felt O
somewhat O
perplexed O
to O
decide O
, O
especially O
as O
she O
was O
seized O
with O
a O
fit O
of O
coughing O
which O
appeared O
almost O
like O
laughter O
, O
while O
she O
hastily O
drank O
up O
the O
water O
in O
her O
finger O
- O
glass O
, O
threw O
salt O
over O
her O
pudding O
, O
and O
committed O
a O
dozen S-CARDINAL
of O
absurdities O
, O
which O
caused O
the O
young O
Baronet S-PERSON
to O
ask O
himself O
whether O
she O
were O
in O
possession O
of O
her O
fifty S-CARDINAL
senses O
. O
A O
moment O
afterwards O
, O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
felt O
his O
arm O
convulsively O
grasped O
by O
the O
young O
lady O
, O
as O
if O
for O
protection O
, O
while O
a O
half O
- O
suppressed O
scream O
burst O
from O
her O
lips O
, O
and O
she O
clung O
to O
him O
with O
an O
aspect O
of O
breathless O
terror O
, O
her O
lips O
parted O
, O
her O
cheeks O
livid O
, O
and O
her O
eyes O
almost O
startling O
from O
her O
head O
, O
as O
she O
gazed O
anxiously O
after O
the O
receding O
figure O
of O
a O
man O
who O
was O
hastily O
leaving O
the O
room O
. O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
, O
when O
thus O
unexpectedly O
appealed O
to O

started O
from O
his O
seat O
to O
offer O
assistance O
, O
though O
at O
a O
loss O
how O
to O
act O
, O
when O
, O
seeing O
Miss O
Smythe's S-PERSON
countenance O
become O
of O
a O
ghastly O
paleness O
, O
he O
rapidly O
poured O
out O
a O
tumbler O
of O
water O
, O
and O
held O
it O
to O
her O
lips O
, O
proposing O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
to O
support O
her O
out O
of O
the O
room O
. O
" O
No O
, O
no O
! O
I O
am O
better O
here O
! O
" O
replied O
she O
, O
in O
trembling O
accents O
. O
" O
I O
— O
I O
need O
society O

" O
Mr. O
Crawford S-PERSON
, O
in O
the O
mean O
time O
, O
had O
rushed O
hastily O
out O

to O
this O
implied O

the O
young O
lady O
only O
answered O
by O
an O
almost O
imperceptible O
shake O
of O
the O
head O
, O
while O
she O
fixed O
her O

two S-CARDINAL
tall O

placed O
themselves O

afterwards O
closely O

asked O
Mrs. O

an O

extreme O
curiosity O

shall O
certainly O
know O

In O

Mr. O

" O
" O

replied O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
, O
haughtily O
turning O
away O

humming O
a O
tune O
. O
" O
Allow O
me O
to O
remind O
you O
that O
those O
who O
whistle O
before O
breakfast O

may O
weep O
before O
night O

" O
said O
the O
stranger O
, O
with O
a O
malignant O
scowl O
, O
drawing O
back O
his O
lips O
, O
and O
breathing O
through O
his O
clenched O
teeth O
, O
as O
he O
glanced O
at O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
, O
and O
galloped O
rapidly O
away O
, O
followed O
at O
a O
more O
moderate O
pace O
by O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
gentlemen O

" O
I O
am O
in O
the O
humor O
to O
knock O
every O

down O

said O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON

" O
and O
there O
was O
an O
admirable O
opportunity O
lost O
! O
I O
dislike O
the O
looks O
of O
that O
man O

is O

cracked O

Depend O
upon O
it O

his O
skull O
will O
never O
ring O
again O

Do O
you O
observe O
, O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
, O
he O
has O
nearly O
overtaken O
the O
carriage O
, O
and O
pulls O
up O
now O
, O
apparently O
anxious O
not O
to O
be O
seen O
by O
the O
servants O
. O
In O
days O
of O
yore O
, O
we O
might O
have O
been O
certain O
he O
was O
a O
highwayman O
, O
going O
to O
rob O
that O
barouche O

such O
things O
are O
done O
in O
a O
pocket O

picking O

pettifogging O
way O
now O

without O
an O
atom O

my O
good O

what O
a O
very O

brown O

is O
the O
matter O

" O
" O
Nothing O

am O
solving O
an O
enigma O

Dunbar S-PERSON
, O
years S-DATE
have O
passed O
since O
that O
voice O
rang O
in O
my O
ears O
, O
but O
it O
must O
be O
Ernest B-PERSON
Anstruther's E-PERSON
! O
Though O
shrill O
from O
excitement O
, O
and O
every O
fibre O
of O
his O
body O
seems O
dilated O
with O
madness O
, O
it O
can O
be O
no O
other O
, O
and O
we O
must O
have O
him O
seized O
this B-DATE

. O
I O
actually O
shivered O
before O
the O
fierce O
glare O
of O
his O
eye O

let O
us O
forget O
it O
. O
I O
cannot O
speak O
upon O
the O
subject O
at O
present O

it O
involves O
all O
the O
deepest O
interests O

my O
life O

Now O
, O
then O
, O
for O
Fountain B-FAC
Abbey E-FAC
! O
I O
feel O
in O
the O
humor O
that O
I O
could O
strike O
the O
air O
for O
breathing O
in O
my O
face O
. O
It O
would O
be O
dangerous O
for O
any O
body O
to O
ask O
me O
how O
I O
do O
! O
" O
" O
I O
wish O
all O
gaunt O
skeletons O

out O

The O
very O
idea O
of O

would O
give O
me O
the O
rheumatism O

not O
better O
return O

said O
Sir O

, O
looking O
anxiously O
at O
his O
companion O

" O
No O
! O
" O
replied O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
, O
who O
seemed O
resolute O
to O
conquer O
his O
agitation O
, O
or O
to O
conceal O
it O
. O
" O
I O
say O
like O
Luther S-PERSON
, O
' O
if O
it O
rained O
madmen O
, O
let O
us O
go O
on O
! O
' O
" O
" O
Then O
, O
my O
good O
fellow O

you O
deserve O

put O
in O
a O
straight O
waistcoat O
yourself O
! O
" O
" O
Well O
, O
if O
you O
will O
buy O

pay O
for O
one O

I O
have O
not O
the O
slightest O
objection O
to O
wear O
it O

" O
" O
If O
we O
could O
get O
up O

good O
old O

for O
this O
occasion O

go O
to O
Fountain B-FAC
Abbey E-FAC
some O
other O
day O
by O
moonlight O
, O
there O
would O
be O
some O
sense O
in O
it O
, O
" O
persisted O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
| | O
but O
seeing O
that O
his O
friend O
was O
not O
to O
be O
dissuaded O
, O
he O
changed O
the O
subject O
, O
adding O
: O
" O
Our O
existence O
now O
is O
detestably O
matter O
- O
of O
- O
fact O

I O
should O

have O
lived O
in O
the O
days O

an O
excursion O
, O
commend O
me O
to O
Harwood B-ORG
House E-ORG

It O
is O
like O
a O
fashionable O
residence O

Such O
Brussels S-GPE
carpets O

that O
I O

quite O
at O

here O

a O
bad O

worse O
dinner O

A O
refrectory O
with O
no O

a O
kitchen O
fire O
, O
where O
a O
whole O
herd O
of O
oxen O
might O
be O
roasted O
whole O
, O
and O
not O
so O
much O
as O
a O
beefsteak O
to O

Visitors O
may O
not O
even O
take O

the O
horses O
, O
a O
nose O
- O
bag O
with O
provisions O

" O
" O
We O
might O
at O

air O

me O

us O
make O
the O

We O
must O
honor O
the O
old O

a O
glance O

I O
am O
sure O

" O
It O

as O

an O
appointment O

happy O

being O
able O
to O

why O

how O
often O

unable O

tell O
the O
cause O

perhaps O
, O
Miss O

to O
excite O
the O
pity O

deserve O
. O
" O
" O
There O
is O
evidently O
a O
much O
greater O
proportion O
of O
happiness O
than O
of O
misery O
in O
the O
animal O

to O
talk O
on O

hopping O
sportively O
from O

fluttering O
in O
rapid O
career O
from O

humming O
aloud O
their O
ceaseless O
sounds O

" O

undeniably O
true O

Mr. O

" O
If O

no O

Our O
earthly O

you O

precariously O

toiling O
up O
the O
bank O
there O
, O
whose O
legs O
look O
so O
thin O

I O
often O
wonder O
he O
has O
courage O
to O
venture O
upon O
them O
at O
all O

He O
is O
most O

when O
actually O

down O
the O

so O
very O
fast O

replied O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
supercilious O
smile O
on O
her O
haughty O
lip O
. O
" O

think O

" O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
looked O
at O
Agnes S-PERSON
with O
a O
penetrating O
air O
of O
astonishment O
, O
which O
gradually O
changed O
to O
an O
expression O
of O
satirical O
indifference O
, O

he O
added O
, O
" O
This O
is O
an O
odd O
world O

" O
" O

it O
is O
! O
When O
did O
that O
idea O
first S-ORDINAL

you O

It O
seems O
so O
very O
new O

" O
replied O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
tone O
of O
biting O
satire O
. O
" O
Patrick S-PERSON
has O
often O
told O
me O
that O
the B-ORG

reckoned O
a O
sagacious O
family O

perhaps O
, O
after O
so O
bright O
a O
remark O

out O

" O

not O
! O
I O
shall O
, O
perhaps O
, O
be O
like O
Cimon S-PERSON

awakened O
from O
stupidity O
by O
the O
charms O
of O
a O
second S-ORDINAL

" O
said O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
, O
with O
an O
air O
as O
if O
he O
had O
surpassed O
himself O

but O
the O
smile O
with O
which O
Agnes S-PERSON
listened O
to O
this O
characteristic O
reply O
was O
cold O
and O
transient O
as O
a O
gleam O
of O
sunshine O
on O
a O
frozen O
lake O

yet O
while O
her O
features O
remained O
immoveable O
as O
those O
of O
a O
beautiful O
statue O
, O
a O
strange O
, O
unnatural O
fire O
sparkled O
in O
her O
splendid O
eyes O

and O
with O
a O
look O
of O
withering O
indignation O

turned O
haughtily O
away O

while O
Captain O

Crespigny E-PERSON
, O
humming O
the O

with O
his O
cane O
the O
heads O
off O
all O
the O

along O

path O

quickened O
his O
pace O

resumed O
his O
not O
very O
welcome O
assiduities O
to O
Marion S-PERSON

felt O
insufferably O
annoyed O

always O
to O
hear O
the O

nonsense O
talked O

to O
play O
her O
part O
in O
what O
she O
considered O
a O
mere O
hack O
flirtation O
on O
the O
part O
of O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON

while O
she O
greatly O
wondered O
that O
he O
had O
not O
long O
since O
tired O
of O
always O
, O
in O
her O
company O
, O
drawing O
up O
an O
empty O
bucket O
. O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
was O
preparing O
to O
follow O
, O
when O
he O
observed O
the O
young O
sketcher O
hastily O
adding O
a O
last O
touch O
to O
her O
beautiful O
drawing O

and O
before O
she O
could O
assemble O
all O
her O
scattered O
implements O
and O
materials O
, O
which O
he O
had O
assisted O
her O
to O
do O
, O
the O
whole O
joyous O
party O
had O
nearly O
vanished O
out O
of O
sight O
| | O
while O
the O
young O
Baronet's S-PERSON
eyes O
flashed O
with O
amazement O
, O
on O
giving O
a O
clandestine O
glance O
into O
the O
sketch O
- O
book O
, O
to O
find O
there O
an O
extremely O
clever O
caricature O
of O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
, O
as O
he O
stood O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes E-TIME
before O
, O
endeavoring O
to O
divide O
his O
attentions O
among O
the O
whole O
group O
of O
ladies O
. O
On O
examining O
another O
leaf O
, O
he O
found O
, O
to O
his O
yet O
greater O
surprise O
, O
a O
beautiful O
likeness O
of O
Clara B-PERSON
Granville E-PERSON
| | O
and O
turning O
instantly O
to O
his O
young O
companion O
, O
with O
sudden O
emotion O
, O
he O
entreated O
permission O
to O
have O
it O
copied O
. O
While O
he O
was O
yet O
speaking O
, O
the O
young O
lady O
, O
with O
crimsoned O
cheeks O
, O
though O
a O
lurking O
smile O
played O
about O
her O
mouth O
, O
continued O
hastily O
to O
follow O
the O
guide O
, O
tracing O
his O
footsteps O
with O
an O
accuracy O
worthy O
of O
a O
Mohican S-NORP
, O
impatient O
, O
evidently O
, O
to O
overtake O
their O
companions O
, O
as O
she O
hastily O
threaded O
her O
way O
through O
the O
forest O
glades O
, O
and O
beneath O
the O
arching O
branches O
of O
many O
a O
lofty O
tree O
, O
towards O
a O
dark O
, O
gloomy O
- O
looking O
plantation O
, O
to O
which O
their O
guide O
seemed O
now O
impatiently O
hurrying O
them O
. O
He O
was O
dressed O
in O
a O
smock O
frock O
, O
and O
had O
become O
singularly O
silent O
, O
his O
replies O
being O
all O
so O
short O
and O
so O
grudgingly O
given O
, O
that O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
had O
angrily O
yielded O
up O
the O
point O
, O
determined O
to O
give O
the O
man O
nothing O
, O
and O
not O
to O
ask O
him O
another O
question O
, O
when O
suddenly O
his O
arm O
was O
tremblingly O
grasped O
by O
the O
young O
lady O
beside O
him O
| | O
while O
in O
a O
low O
, O
strange O
, O
unearthly O
whisper O
, O
and O
with O
a O
look O
of O
mortal O
terror O
, O
she O
said O
, O
" O
I O
do O
not O
like O
this O
! O
What O
can O
it O
mean O
? O
Has O
he O
escaped O
from O
confinement O
? O
Are O
you O
sure O
that O
man O
is O
our O
guide O
? O
" O
" O
I O
scarcely O
looked O
, O
but O
of O
course O
he O
is O
! O
It O
can O
be O
no O
one O
else O
! O
" O
replied O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
soothing O
tone O
| | O
for O
he O
thought O
she O
must O
certainly O
be O
deranged O
. O
" O
There O
he O
waits O
for O
us O
! O
We O
shall O
overtake O
our O
friends O
immediately O
. O
" O
" O
Look O
at O
this O
tree O
! O
— O
pretend O
to O
be O
admiring O
the O
landscape O
! O
" O
continued O
the O
young O
lady O
, O
in O
a O
deep O
, O
concentrated O
voice O
| | O
" O
but O
tell O
me O
, O
— O
can O
we O
make O
our O
escape O
unobserved O
by O
that O
man O
? O
My O
life O
, O
probably O
, O
depends O
upon O
your O
answer O
! O
" O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
now O
became O
confirmed O
in O
his O
opinion O
respecting O
the O
insanity O
of O
his O
young O
companion O
, O
and O
fixing O
his O
eyes O
on O
her O
countenance O
, O
he O
perceived O
with O
amazement O
that O
every O
tinge O
of O
color O
had O
been O
drained O
from O
her O
cheek O
— O
that O
her O
lip O
quivered O
with O
fright O
, O
and O
that O
terror O
spoke O
in O
her O
eyes O
, O
and O
trembled O
in O
every O
limb O
| | O
while O
her O
words O
poured O
out O
with O
a O
rushing O
vehemence O
of O
tone O
and O
manner O
which O
startled O
and O
alarmed O
him O
. O
" O
I O
caught O
a O
momentary O
glance O
of O
his O
countenance O
! O
Where O
could O
I O
ever O
see O
these O
eyes O
and O
be O
mistaken O
? O
There O
is O
madness O
yet O
in O
their O
expression O
. O
He O
has O
sworn O
to O
destroy O
me O
. O
The O
whole O
purpose O
of O
his O
being O
is O
revenge O
! O
" O
" O
Revenge O

insane O

him O

with O
wild O

hurried O
glances O

" O
Once O
I O
saw O
him O

The O
tone O
of O
intense O
agony O
in O
which O
these O
words O
were O
uttered O
, O
filled O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
with O
pity O
, O
while O
knowing O
the O
fearful O
and O
mysterious O
power O
communicated O
by O
madness O
, O
even O
to O
the O
feeblest O
frame O
, O
he O
felt O
a O
well O
- O
grounded O
apprehension O
for O
the O
terrified O
girl's O
safety O
, O
on O
observing O
the O
strong O

muscular O
figure O
of O
the O
maniac O

therefore O
, O
after O
walking O
on O
some O
steps O
, O
he O
whispered O
to O
her O
, O
almost O
inaudibly O
: O
" O

guide O

back O

drop O
down O
the O
side O

conceal O
yourself O

elevating O
his O
voice O
in O
an O
authoritative O
tone O

this O
crisis O

back O
some O
inaudible O
reply O

in O
a O
surly O

quickened O
his O
pace O

again O
the O

forward O
himself O

the O
sound O
of O
his O
footsteps O
as O
loud O
as O
if O
there O
had O
still O
been O
two S-CARDINAL
behind O

After O
the O
terrified O
girl O
had O
hastily O
slid O
down O
a O
steep O
bank O
and O
disappeared O
amidst O
a O
mass O
of O
evergreens O
, O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
was O
beginning O
to O
contemplate O
the O
expediency O
of O
adopting O
a O
similar O
plan O
, O
seeing O
that O
in O
conflict O
with O
a O
madman O
he O
could O
gain O
neither O
honor O
or O
advantage O
, O
and O
might O
be O
seriously O
injured O
, O
when O
the O
maniac O
suddenly O
burst O
into O
a O
thrilling O
, O
fearful O
laugh O
, O
and O
, O
snatching O
a O
pistol O
from O
his O
breast O
, O
turned O
fiercely O
round O
, O
when O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
instantly O
recognised O
, O
as O
he O
had O
begun O
to O
expect O
, O
the O
countenance O
of O
that O
excited O
stranger O
, O
whom O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
had O
in O
the O
morning O
named O
to O
him O
as O
Ernest B-PERSON
Anstruther E-PERSON
. O
Astonishment O
and O
unimaginable O
fury O
glittered O
in O
the O
madman's O
wild O
and O
haggard O
countenance O
, O
when O
he O
missed O
the O
object O
of O
his O
pursuit O
, O
and O
he O
looked O
for O
the O
moment O
like O
a O
wild O
beast O
at O
bay O
, O
till O
, O
springing O
upon O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
with O
a O
cry O
of O
hideous O
rage O
, O
he O
seized O
hold O
of O
his O
arm O
with O
a O
delirious O
grasp O
, O
and O
clenched O
his O
fist O
, O
shouting O
in O
accents O
of O
frenzied O
rage O

while O
the O
white O
foam O
was O
on O
his O

" O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
stood O
firm O
as O
a O
rock O
before O
this O
whirlwind O
of O
passion O
, O
though O
filled O
with O
horrible O
amazement O

as O
he O
beheld O
the O
burning O
glare O
of O
the O
madman's O
eye O

heard O
the O
sharp O

shrill O
, O
shrieking O
voice O
in O
which O
he O
spoke O

if O
he O

terrible O

he O
seemed O
more O
terrible O
still O
, O
when O
a O
moment O
afterwards O
, O
with O
a O
cold O
, O
livid O
look O

as O
if O
turned O

in O
a O
hollow O
whisper O

while O
a O
look O
of O
dangerous O

preternatural O
fury O

his O
countenance O

an O
expression O

He O
then O
paused O

ground O
his O
teeth O

with O
the O
frightful O
levity O
of O

uttering O

CHAPTER O
XXXVIII O
. O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
gave O
instant O
information O
to O

civil O
authorities O
at O
Harrowgate S-ORG
, O
respecting O
the O
dangerous O
madman O
now O

neighborhood O

and O
when O
every O
particular O
of O
his O
adventure O
had O
reached O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
she O
felt O
an O
undefined O
sensation O
of O
disappointment O
that O
the O
end O
had O
not O
been O
of O
a O
more O
exciting O
nature O

Never O
happy O
unless O
her O
mind O
were O
in O
a O
complete O
foam O
of O
excitement O
, O
she O
lived O
for O
sensation O
, O
and O
would O
have O
bought O
it O
at O
any O
price O
, O
being O
heard O
often O
to O
complain O
, O
that O
now O
nothing O
ever O
happened O
. O
Every O
day O
she O
considered O
as O
a O
chapter O
in O
her O
own O
life O
, O
into O
which O
she O
wished O
as O
many O
incidents O
crowded O
as O
possible O
, O
caring O
little O
whether O
joy O

sorrow O
prevailed O
among O
those O
around O
, O
if O
the O
weary O
vacuum O
in O
her O
thoughts O
were O
but O
filled O
up O
. O
A O
few O
elopements O
or O
murders O
made O
a O
newspaper O
extremely O
acceptable O
| | O
while O
even O
public O
riots O
she O
would O
have O
allowed O
to O
a O
certain O
pitch O
, O
provided O
she O
could O
pull O
the O
check O
- O
string O
as O
soon O
as O
they O
became O
at O
all O
inconvenient O
or O
alarming O
to O
herself O
| | O
while O
she O
often O
remarked O
, O
in O
a O
querulous O
tone O
, O
that O
a O
revolution O
had O
been O
a O
thing O
threatened O
and O
talked O
of O
all O
her O
life O
, O
without O
ever O
seeming O
any O
nearer O
. O
The O
world O
, O
in O
short O
, O
if O
arranged O
to O
suit O
her O
taste O
, O
would O
have O
been O
one S-CARDINAL
shifting O
scene O

accidents O

offences O

On O
the O
evening O
after O
the O
pic-nic O
at O
Studley S-GPE
, O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
having O
gone O
early O
to O
bed O
, O
at O
his O
lodgings O
near O
the O
Granby S-GPE
, O
Marion S-PERSON
accompanied O
her O
sister O
and O
Mrs. O
O'Donoghoe S-PERSON
, O
to O
fulfil O
a O
dinner O
engagement O
at O
the B-FAC
Crown I-FAC
Hotel E-FAC
| | O
and O
on O
their O
way O
home O
, O
the O
lively O
widow O
rallied O
Agnes S-PERSON
on O
her O
prospect O
of O
walking O
at O
the O
next O
coronation O
, O
saying O
, O
that O
Lord O
Doncaster S-PERSON
had O
evidently O
laid O
down O
twenty B-DATE
years E-DATE
of O
his O
life O
, O
lately O
| | O
and O
that O
she O
had O
once O
seen O
the O
Doncaster S-GPE
diamonds O
, O
then O
considered O
the O
finest O
family O
jewels O
in O
Britain S-GPE
, O
which O
Queen B-PERSON
Charlotte E-PERSON
herself O
was O
supposed O
to O
have O
coveted O
, O
and O
the O
box O
containing O
which O
required O
two S-CARDINAL
footmen O
to O
carry O
it O
. O
" O
The O
tiara O
would O
shine O
like O
glow O
- O
worms O
in O
your O
dark O
hair O
, O
and O
the O
bandeau O
round O
your O
waist O
would O
be O
exquisite O
! O
I O
have O
heard O
it O
remarked O
, O
that O
people O
in O
this O
perverse O
world O
will O
not O
be O
happy O
| | O
that O
those O
who O
have O
every O
wish O
gratified O
, O
and O
not O
a O
want O
upon O
earth O
, O
invent O
a O
grievance O
for O
themselves O
, O
and O
live O
upon O
it O

but O
I O
wonder O
where O
the O
Marchioness O
of O
Doncaster S-GPE
could O
find O
one O
. O
You O
might O
drive O
away O
care O
in O
that O
beautiful O
pony O
carriage O
, O
kill O
time O
with O
your O
grand O
pianoforte O
, O
and O
read O
your O
own O
happiness O
in O
the O
envy O
of O
every O
one O
around O
. O
Even O
your O
sister O
seems O
scarcely O
so O
happy O
at O
your O
good O
fortune O
as O
might O
have O
been O
expected O
! O
" O
" O
There O
is O
no O
earthly O
blessing O
I O
do O
not O
with O
my O
whole O
heart O
desire O
for O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
" O
replied O
Marion S-PERSON
warmly O
, O
when O
thus O
appealed O
to O
. O
" O
But O
if O
she O
has O
any O
plans O
such O
as O
you O
speak O
of O
, O
let O
no O
one O
ask O
me O
what O
I O
think O
, O
as O
it O
is O
quite O
enough O
that O
she O
should O
herself O
know O
my O
utter O
abhorrence O
of O
them O
. O
" O
Tears O
of O
indignant O
sorrow O
sprang O
into O
Marion's S-PERSON
eyes O
, O
and O
she O
gazed O
earnestly O
out O
of O
the O
window O
, O
trying O
to O
conceal O
and O
to O
conquer O
her O
emotion O
, O
while O
Mrs. O
O'Donoghoe S-PERSON
exclaimed O
, O
in O
a O
tone O
of O
satirical O
burlesque O
, O
" O
For O
of O
the O
choice O
, O
what O
heart O
can O
doubt O

Of O
tents O

thrones O

" O
As O
their O
carriage O
drove O
on O
, O
the O
night O
being O
clear O
and O
moon O
- O
lit O
, O
the O
wind O
sweeping O
over O
the O
earth O
with O
a O
rushing O
sound O

and O
ten B-CARDINAL
thousand E-CARDINAL
stars O
twinkling O
in O
the O
blue O
vault O
above O
, O
Agnes S-PERSON
remarked O
, O
in O
accents O
of O
surprise O
, O
that O
crowds O
of O
people O
were O
running O
eagerly O
on O
the O
road O
, O
with O
animated O
looks O
, O
and O
an O
appearance O
of O
most O
unusual O
excitement O
. O
Soon O
after O
she O
heard O
a O
rumbling O
noise O
behind O
, O
as O
of O
some O
heavy O
vehicle O
hurtling O
and O
thundering O
along O
the O
road O

and O
the O
next O
moment O
a O
fire O
- O
engine O
passed O
at O
full O
speed O
, O
amidst O
the O
cheers O
and O
vociferations O
of O
a O
dense O
multitude O
, O
who O
assisted O

followed O
its O
progress O
, O
with O
looks O
of O
mingled O
curiosity O
, O
delight O
, O
and O
apprehension O

Marion S-PERSON
hastily O
thrust O
her O
head O
far O
out O
of O
the O
carriage O
, O
and O
perceived O
that O
a O
lurid O
glare O

bright O

upwards O

a O
fresh O
burst O
of O
dazzling O
light O
blazed O
to O
the O
very O
heavens O

Marion S-PERSON
watched O

solemn O

Agnes S-PERSON
, O
after O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
surprise O
was O
over O

sank O
lazily O
back O
into O
the O
carriage O

saying O
, O
with O
a O
look O
of O
peevish O
disappointment O
, O
" O
It O
is O
only O
a O
fire O

so O
common O
now O
, O
that O
they O
excite O
scarcely O
any O

One S-CARDINAL
might O
fancy O
, O
Marion S-PERSON

that O
you O
had O
a O
valuable O

" O
" O
It O
looks O

at O

" O
replied O
Marion S-PERSON
. O
" O
The O
hills O
are O
like O
molten O
fire O

while O
the O
broad O
red O
reflection O
on O
those O
massy O
clouds O

the O
very O

fiery O
light O

What O
sheets O

It O

fearfully O
grand O

that O
no O

now O
any O

ever O

never O

added O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
tone O
of O
contemptuous O
pity O
, O
" O

" O
" O
What O
a O

" O
exclaimed O
Marion S-PERSON
. O
" O
It O
is O
curious O
, O
that O
probably O
some O
of O
those O
people O
who O
are O
ready O
to O
risk O
their O
lives O
in O
extinguishing O
the O
flames O
, O
would O
yet O
feel O
quite O
disappointed O
and O
ill O
- O
treated O
on O
arriving O

to O
find O
that O
there O

no O

There O
are O
no O

to O
the O
love O

When O
people O
have O
made O
up O
their O
great O
minds O
to O
a O
catastrophe O
, O
they O
feel O
really O
cheated O
if O
it O
does O
not O
occur O

and O
I O
often O
think O
, O
that O
old O
people O
especially O
wish O
their O
few O
remaining O
days O
to O
be O
crowded O
with O
events O
, O
like O
the O
last O
pages O
in O
a O
novel O
. O
" O
The O
noise O
and O
the O
mob O
had O
greatly O
increased O
: O
loud O
shouts O
, O
hoarse O
yells O
, O
and O
clamorous O
cries O
of O
fire O
resounded O
on O
every O
side O
, O
with O
the O
heavy O
trampling O
of O
a B-QUANTITY
hundred I-QUANTITY
feet E-QUANTITY
, O
when O
suddenly O
Sir O
Arthur's S-PERSON
coachman O
whipped O
the O
horses O
violently O
, O
and O
proceeded O
forward O
with O
unprecedented O
rapidity O
, O
till O
Marion S-PERSON
fancied O
the O
horses O
must O
have O
taken O
fright O
at O
the O
ignited O
sparks O
, O
which O
were O
now O
borne O
along O
in O
the O
air O
, O
and O
that O
maddened O
with O
terror O
, O
they O
were O
actually O
running O
off O
. O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
now O
really O
in O
a O
state O
of O
excitement O
, O
thrust O
her O
head O
again O
out O
of O
the O
window O
, O
believing O
that O
the O
coachman O
must O
be O
drunk O
, O
and O
that O
a O
catastrophe O
, O
though O
not O
exactly O
what O
she O
would O
have O
selected O
, O
might O
actually O
occur O
, O
and O
Marion S-PERSON
continued O
anxiously O
gazing O
around O
, O
till O
gradually O
a O
horrid O
sensation O
of O
doubt O
and O
fear O
gathered O
upon O
her O
mind O
, O
as O
she O
looked O
in O
the O
direction O
from O
which O
the O
light O
came O
. O
The O
curtain O
of O
night O
was O
withdrawn O
— O
the O
surrounding O
scene O
seemed O
one S-CARDINAL
mighty O
furnace O
— O
and O
the O
roaring O
noise O
of O
the O
flames O
was O
now O
distinctly O
audible O
. O
At O
a O
turn O
of O
the O
road O
the O
whole O
became O
distinctly O
visible O

and O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
suddenly O
uttering O
a O
wild O
cry O
of O
horror O
and O
amazement O
, O
covered O
her O
face O
with O
her O
hands O
, O
and O
sank O
back O
, O
almost O
fainting O
, O
in O
the O
carriage O

for O
she O
had O
at O
once O
become O
aware O
that O
the O
fire O
must O
be O
among O
the O
houses O
where O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
lodged O
. O
The O
garden O
around O
them O
was O
one S-CARDINAL
vivid O
blaze O
of O
burning O
light O
— O
the O
stems O
of O
the O
trees O
were O
visible O
in O
dark O
relief O
, O
on O
a O
drapery O
of O
fire O
— O
while O
a O
brilliant O
pillar O
of O
flame O
, O
like O
a O
gigantic O
serpent O
, O
twirled O
its O
enormous O
coils O
upwards O
into O
the O
very O
sky O
. O
Forked O
flames O
appeared O
bursting O
from O
every O
window O
, O
and O
sweeping O
over O
the O
whole O
house O
, O
which O
was O
one S-CARDINAL
great O
reservoir O
of O
fire O
, O
while O
a O
black O
volume O
of O
smoke O
rolled O
far O
away O
to O
the O
distant O
horizon O
. O
" O
Is O
there O
no O
mistake O
? O
" O
exclaimed O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
wringing O
her O
hands O
with O
terror O
, O
and O
bending O
her O
head O
almost O
to O
her O
knees O
in O
unendurable O
grief O
. O
" O
Is O
there O
no O
hope O

Tell O
John S-PERSON

drive O
on O
faster O

faster O

me O
out O

me O
fly O

me O
out O

me O
out O

" O
Dear O
Marion S-PERSON
! O
there O
are O
crowds O
giving O
assistance O
! O
He O
must O
have O
escaped O

" O
said O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
in O
trembling O
accents O
. O
" O
I O
feel O
certain O
he O
has O
escaped O

He O
has O
surely O
heard O
the O
noise O
, O

called O
for O
help O
! O
" O
A O
dense O
mass O
of O
persons O
round O
the O
crashing O
house O
, O
wild O
with O
agitation O
, O
and O
vehement O
in O
their O
attitudes O
and O
gestures O
, O
prevented O
the O
carriage O
from O
advancing O
farther O
| | O
but O
Marion S-PERSON
instantly O
opened O
the O
door O
, O
sprang O
out O
, O
and O
with O
an O
impetuosity O
which O
nothing O
could O
resist O
, O
rushed O
onwards O
. O
She O
was O
not O
one O
whose O
faculties O
could O
be O
prostrated O
by O
terror O
or O
danger O
| | O
for O
it O
was O
then O
that O
her O
quick O
judgment O
and O
generous O
spirit O
became O
most O
active O
| | O
and O
while O
crowds O
were O
standing O
around O
, O
in O
vacant O
, O
helpless O
wonder O
, O
she O
reached O
the O
spot O
where O
a O
tottering O
ladder O
had O
been O
placed O
against O
the O
walls O
, O
and O
where O
the O
engines O
were O
playing O
upon O
the O
blazing O
roofs O
, O
while O
flames O
spouted O
forth O
in O
every O
direction O
, O
and O
a O
confused O
din O
of O
cries O
and O
vociferous O
oaths O
became O
audible O
on O
every O
side O
. O
Timid O
and O
easily O
frightened O
on O
slight O
occasion O
, O
all O
emotion O
now O
appeared O
to O
be O
dead O
within O
the O
breast O
of O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
who O
paused O
, O
while O
, O
with O
bloodless O
cheek O
, O
and O
a O
face O
as O
rigid O
as O
death O
, O
she O
seemed O
turned O
into O
stone O

yet O
every O
word O
whispered O
around O
fell O
with O
frightful O
distinctness O
on O
her O
ear O
. O
" O
The O
last O
house O
that O
caught O
fire O

uninhabited O

asked O
a O
stranger O
, O
calmly O
. O
" O
I O
am O
informed O
that O
the O
whole O
conflagration O
was O
raised O
by O
a O
madman O
— O
a O
perfect O
Guy B-PERSON
Fawkes E-PERSON
, O
who O
afterwards O
escaped O
. O
There O
are O
crowds O
of O
servants O
belonging O
to O
the O
heiress O
Miss O
Howard S-PERSON
, O

he O
had O
some O
scheme O
of O
carrying O
her O
off O

most O
mercifully O
she O
and O
her O
attendants O
were O
all O
saved O

" O
Very O
fortunate O

as O
the O
stair O

now O
falling O
in O
, O
" O
added O
another O
, O
while O
crash O
followed O
crash O
in O
frightful O
succession O
. O
" O
Some O
one O
talked O
of O
a O
blind O
gentleman O
being O
there O
, O
but O
that O
is O
probably O
a O
picturesque O
addition O
, O
to O
give O
the O
story O
interest O
, O
for O
that O
tall O
house O
seems O
really O
empty O

" O
At O
this O
moment O
, O
a O
low O
murmur O
of O
grief O
and O
horror O
arose O
among O
the O
crowd O
, O
followed O
by O
a O
death O
- O
like O
silence O
. O
In O
a O
part O
of O
the O
building O
high O
above O
what O
had O
yet O
been O
consumed O
by O
the O
flames O

already O
undermined O

the O
shutters O

a O
window O
were O
slowly O
opened O
, O
the O
sash O
hastily O
thrown O
open O
, O
and O
the O
venerable O
figure O
of O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
appeared O
there O
, O
his O
grey O
hair O
streaming O
in O
the O
wind O
, O
and O
his O
head O
stretched O
forward O
in O
the O
act O
of O
listening O
. O
He O
raised O
his O
hand O
to O
his O
forehead O
, O
as O
if O
bewildered O
, O
and O
seemed O
evidently O
calling O
for O
help O

but O
his O
feeble O
voice O
was O
lost O
amid O
the O
war O
of O
elements O
, O
the O
crackling O
and O
blazing O
of O
all O
around O
, O
and O
the O
loud O
crash O
of O
falling O
timber O
. O
No O
one O
had O
a O
hope O
of O
his O
being O
rescued O
, O
and O
the O
most O
selfishly O
indifferent O
looked O
on O
with O
breathless O
dismay O
, O
while O
Agnes S-PERSON
threw O
herself O
on O
the O
grass O
in O
an O
agony O
of O
horror O

despair O

Marion S-PERSON
rapidly O
grasped O
her O
hand O
with O
convulsive O
energy O

saying O

in O
a O
low O
deep O
whisper O
, O
" O
I O
shall O
save O
him O

die O
with O
him O

" O
Using O
the O
speed O
of O
thought O
she O
flew O
forward O
, O
while O
every O
voice O
was O
raised O
in O
loud O
shouts O
to O
stop O
her O

and O
several O
persons O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
they O
became O
aware O
of O
Marion's S-PERSON
rash O
intentions O
, O
followed O
vehemently O
in O
pursuit O
, O
determined O
to O
force O
her O
back O

eluding O
their O
grasp O
, O
she O
wrapped O
her O
large O
cloak O
around O
her O
, O
and O
ascended O
the O
crackling O
beams O
of O
the O
staircase O
, O
beneath O
a O
shower O
of O
glowing O
sparks O
, O
while O
blazing O
flames O
were O
running O
round O
the O
cornices O

ceiling O
, O
with O
a O
sound O
like O
incessant O
thunder O
. O
The O
smoke O
nearly O
blinded O
her O
— O
the O
smell O
of O
burning O
wood O
became O
suffocating O
— O
and O
the O
heat O
was O
nearly O
unbearable O
. O
Long O
wreaths O
of O
fire O
and O
smoke O
soon O
shut O
Marion S-PERSON
out O
from O
the O
view O
of O
those O
who O
followed O

none O
could O
pursue O
with O
their O
eyes O
the O
fearful O
progress O
of O
her O
enterprise O
, O
while O
she O
hurried O
onwards O
, O
having O
one O
only O
thought O
in O
her O
heart O
, O
that O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON

blind O

alone O

was O
calling O

intense O
and O
devouring O
flame O
, O
which O
had O
almost O
entirely O
burned O
it O
away O
, O
showed O
yet O
a O
plank O
remaining O
close O
to O
the O
wall O
, O
charred O
and O
blackened O
, O
while O
shrivelling O
and O
crackling O
in O
the O
devouring O
element O
. O
Over O
this O
Marion S-PERSON
quickly O
but O
cautiously O
glided O
| | O
and O
opening O
the O
Admiral's S-FAC
door O
, O
she O
tried O
to O
compose O
her O
voice O
, O
saying O
in O
a O
clear O
, O
distinct O
tone O
— O
" O
I O
am O
here O
, O
uncle O
Arthur S-PERSON
! O
come O
away O
quickly O
! O
give O
me O
your O
hand O
! O
" O
" O
What O
is O
the O
matter O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
? O
What O
is O
all O
this O
? O
" O
replied O
he O
, O
turning O
round O
with O
a O
quivering O
lip O
, O
and O
in O
a O
tone O
of O
piercing O
agitation O
. O
" O
The O
blessings O
of O
your O
blind O
and O
helpless O
uncle O
be O
upon O
you O
! O
I O
am O
so O
agitated O
and O
confused O
! O
Where O
is O
the O
fire O
? O
Every O
body O
had O
forgotten O
me O
but O
you O
! O
" O
" O
Uncle O
Arthur S-PERSON
! O
" O
answered O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
hurrying O
with O
him O
towards O
the O
door O
, O
where O
they O
were O
almost O
suffocated O
by O
a O
dense O
cloud O
of O
dust O
and O
smoke O
| | O
" O
you O
were O
always O
brave O
and O
determined O
. O
All O
our O
courage O
is O
necessary O
now O
. O
Be O
firm O
and O
we O
may O
escape O
. O
You O
are O
now O
at O
the O
door O
. O
This O
wooden O
gallery O
is O
nearly O
burned O
away O
. O
It O
could O
not O
sustain O
us O
both O
, O
and O
no O
earthly O
power O
shall O
persuade O
me O
to O
go O
first S-ORDINAL
. O
You O
can O
only O
impede O
me O
by O
speaking O
of O
it O
. O
Lose O
not O
a O
moment O
, O
then O
, O
for O
that O
will O
but O
increase O
our O
danger O
. O
Cling O
close O
to O
the O
wall O
| | O
feel O
it O
all O
the O
way O
. O
I O
shall O
call O
out O
when O
you O
are O
safely O
over O
. O
Then O
remember O
the O
fifty S-CARDINAL
steps O
we O
always O
counted O
to O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
landing O
- O
place O
. O
After O
that O
, O
turn O
to O
the O
right O
, O
and O
you O
are O
safe O
. O
May O
the O
Almighty O
protect O
and O
guide O
you O
! O
" O
" O
But O
Marion S-PERSON
! O
my O
dear O
child O
! O
you O
are O
coming O
this O
way O
too O
? O
" O
" O
Yes O
! O
or O
perhaps O
some O
other O
! O
" O
said O
she O
, O
assuming O
a O
tone O
of O
indifference O
, O
while O
she O
despondingly O
gazed O
at O
the O
rapidly O
consuming O
beam O
, O
and O
the O
thick O
smoke O
, O
which O
arose O
like O
mist O
before O
her O
sight O
. O
" O
Go O
on O
, O
dear O
uncle O
, O
and O
pray O
for O
yourself O
and O
me O
. O
" O
Marion S-PERSON
led O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
to O
the O
very O
brink O
of O
the O
yawning O
gulf O
, O
and O
cautiously O
placed O
him O
on O
the O
tottering O
gallery O
, O
deaf O
to O
his O
entreaties O
that O
she O
would O
seek O
her O
own O
safely O
first S-ORDINAL
, O
and O
imploring O
him O
not O
to O
render O
her O
enterprise O
unavailing O
by O
delay O
. O
Flames O
were O
leaping O
upwards O
in O
the O
dark O
abyss O
beneath O
, O
dust O
and O
mortar O
fell O
in O
clouds O
on O
every O
side O
, O
while O
the O
heat O
and O
noise O
of O
the O
flashing O
light O
became O
more O
and O
more O
terrific O
| | O
but O
still O
she O
spoke O
calmly O
to O
him O
, O
in O
tones O
of O
confidence O
and O
encouragement O
, O
giving O
directions O
while O
he O
remained O
in O
sight O
, O
and O
anxiously O
watching O
, O
as O
he O
slowly O
and O
cautiously O
groped O
his O
way O
. O
All O
Sir O
Arthur's S-PERSON
firmness O
of O
look O
and O
voice O
had O
now O
returned O
, O
as O
he O
questioned O
or O
thanked O
her O
, O
when O
suddenly O
a O
deafening O
crash O
took O
place O
over O
head O
, O
an O
impending O
fragment O
of O
the O
roof O
was O
precipitated O
with O
a O
roaring O
convulsion O
upon O
the O
spot O
where O
a O
moment O
before O
the O
Admiral O
had O
stood O
, O
and O
nothing O
now O
remained O
beneath O
the O
eye O
of O
Marion S-GPE
but O
a O
hideous O
gulf O
of O
smoke O
and O
ruins O
, O
one S-CARDINAL
bewildering O
medley O
of O
crackling O
beams O
and O
falling O
floors O
, O
a O
mighty O
mass O
of O
horror O
, O
which O
it O
made O
her O
giddy O
to O
behold O
. O
Marion S-PERSON
ceased O
now O
to O
speak O
, O
fearful O
that O
her O
voice O
might O
induce O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
if O
yet O
alive O
, O
to O
return O
| | O
and O
nearly O
hopeless O
of O
his O
having O
escaped O
, O
she O
now O
felt O
that O
no O
duty O
was O
so O
imperative O
, O
as O
, O
if O
possible O
, O
to O
seek O
her O
own O
safely O
. O
Yet O
what O
resource O
remained O
? O
Her O
heart O
beat O
hurriedly O
, O
stopped O
and O
beat O
again O
, O
while O
a O
choking O
sensation O
arose O
in O
her O
throat O
, O
when O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
she O
fully O
contemplated O
her O
own O
instant O
danger O
. O
The O
noise O
was O
like O
that O
of O
a O
mighty O
wind O
, O
while O
the O
flames O
swept O
the O
very O
heavens O
, O
with O
a O
sound O
more O
appalling O
than O
the O
loudest O
thunder O
, O
and O
she O
hurried O
almost O
breathlessly O
back O
to O
Sir B-FAC
Arthur's I-FAC
apartment E-FAC
, O
which O
had O
not O
yet O
been O
attacked O
by O
the O
devouring O
element O
. O
The O
heat O
was O
even O
there O
so O
intense O
, O
that O
she O
hastened O
to O
a O
window O
for O
air O
, O
and O
a O
shuddering O
groan O
burst O
from O
the O
surrounding O
multitude O
when O
they O
beheld O
her O
| | O
but O
no O
succor O
was O
near O
, O
while O
the O
door O
became O
instantly O
blockaded O
by O
shivered O
beams O
and O
smouldering O
ruins O
, O
which O
had O
fallen O
at O
the O
entrance O
, O
setting O
it O
on O
fire O
, O
and O
she O
saw O
around O
long O
aisles O
of O
flame O
, O
and O
deep O
caverns O
filled O
with O
surges O
of O
fire O
and O
smoke O
. O
Marion S-PERSON
felt O
now O
that O
death O
impended O
in O
its O
most O
terrifying O
form O
. O
It O
was O
no O
new O
thing O
with O
her O
to O
prepare O
for O
the O
certain O
approach O
of O
dissolution O
| | O
yet O
often O
as O
she O
had O
tried O
to O
realize O
the O
idea O
of O
that O
mighty O
change O
, O
never O
did O
it O
appear O
before O
with O
the O
appalling O
distinctness O
, O
which O
now O
filled O
her O
spirit O
with O
unutterable O
awe O
, O
while O
standing O
as O
it O
were O
between O
earth O
and O
heaven O
, O
all O
beneath O
full O
of O
boundless O
terror O
, O
but O
all O
above O
promising O
peace O
, O
and O
full O
of O
hope O
. O
No O
effort O
of O
her O
own O
could O
avail O
. O
Marion S-PERSON
looked O
at O
the O
long O
line O
of O
tall O
houses O
on O
her O
left O
, O
untouched O
by O
the O
flames O
. O
She O
glanced O
at O
the O
crowd O
below O
, O
all O
anxiously O
gazing O
upwards O
, O
in O
death O
- O
like O
stillness O
, O
and O
at O
the O
garden O
, O
which O
seemed O
paved O
with O
faces O
| | O
but O
while O
the O
consuming O
flames O
pursued O
their O
desolating O
track O
, O
not O
a O
hope O
of O
rescue O
appeared O
. O
A O
storm O
of O
burning O
ashes O
fell O
on O
every O
side O
, O
and O
all O
around O
was O
a O
whirlwind O
of O
fire O
and O
smoke O
. O
Marion's S-PERSON
figure O
became O
conspicuously O
seen O
at O
the O
window O
, O
every O
pane O
of O
which O
was O
already O
so O
heated O
by O
the O
blazing O
conflagration O
behind O
, O
that O
she O
leaned O
against O
the O
shutters O
, O
and O
gazed O
towards O
heaven O
, O
as O
if O
already O
lost O
to O
all O
connection O
with O
the O
world O
around O
. O
" O
Martyrs O
have O
willingly O
died O
in O
a O
scene O
like O
this O
, O
" O
thought O
she O
. O
" O
Let O
me O
also O
testify O
the O
faith O
in O
which O
I O
die O
. O
" O
Marion S-PERSON
clasped O
her O
hands O
, O
while O
now O
her O
spirit O
rose O
superior O
to O
danger O
, O
and O
, O
seeing O
the O
hundreds S-CARDINAL
gazing O
at O
her O
in O
silent O
, O
horror O
- O
struck O
sympathy O
, O
she O
calmly O
pointed O
upwards O
, O
that O
all O
might O
remember O
the O
comfort O
derived O
from O
a O
hope O
full O
of O
immortality O
. O
The O
heat O
had O
become O
so O
intense O
, O
that O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
choked O
almost O
to O
suffocation O
, O
leaned O
farther O
than O
ever O
out O
of O
the O
window O
, O
trying O
to O
catch O
one S-CARDINAL
breath O
of O
air O
, O
when O
to O
her O
astonishment O
she O
now O
perceived O
the O
figure O
of O
a O
man O
descending O
from O
the O
window O
of O
a O
house O
far O
to O
the O
left O
, O
and O
having O
planted O
his O
foot O
on O
a O
narrow O
ledge O
of O
stone O
, O
which O
ran O
along O
all O
the O
buildings O
as O
an O
architectural O
ornament O
, O
he O
pressed O
his O
hands O
firmly O
against O
the O
wall O
, O
to O
preserve O
his O
balance O
, O
and O
, O
with O
a O
degree O
of O
skill O
and O
intrepidity O
scarcely O
to O
be O
credited O
, O
rapidly O
traversed O
that O
shelf O
towards O
the O
place O
where O
she O
stood O
, O
carrying O
one S-CARDINAL
end O
of O
a O
rope O
in O
his O
hand O
, O
the O
other O
extremity O
of O
which O
had O
been O
already O
fixed O
to O
the O
window O
from O
which O
he O
came O
out O
. O
" O
Marion S-PERSON
! O
dear O
Marion S-PERSON
! O
" O
cried O
the O
voice O
of O
Richard B-PERSON
Granville E-PERSON
, O
which O
even O
at O
this O
awful O
moment O
thrilled O
to O
her O
heart O
with O
deep O
emotion O
, O
" O
we O
must O
live O
or O
die O
together O
. O
Trust O
yourself O
to O
me O
! O
Here O
is O
a O
firm O
footing O
. O
Try O
it O
! O
At O
the O
worst O
you O
cannot O
be O
in O
greater O
danger O
than O
now O
. O
" O
While O
yet O
speaking O
, O
he O
had O
securely O
fixed O
the O
rope O
to O
the O
window O
- O
frame O
, O
thus O
forming O
a O
temporary O
balustrade O
, O
and O
after O
carefully O
assisting O
her O
out O
, O
he O
slowly O
led O
Marion S-PERSON
with O
one S-CARDINAL
hand O
on O
the O
rope O
, O
and O
her O
face O
to O
the O
wall O
, O
safely O
towards O
a O
house O
as O
yet O
untouched O
by O
the O
fire O
. O
A O
low O
, O
whispering O
murmur O
of O
intense O
interest O
arose O
among O
the O
spectators O
, O
when O
they O
saw O
hopes O
of O
her O
being O
preserved O
, O
but O
not O
a O
voice O
was O
raised O
till O
they O
perceived O
her O
safe O
, O
when O
a O
deafening O
cheer O
burst O
from O
the O
spectators O
, O
which O
rang O
through O
every O
ear O
like O
a O
trumpet O
. O
Again O
and O
again O
it O
resounded O
, O
louder O
and O
louder O
still O
, O
but O
Marion S-PERSON
heard O
it O
not O
, O
for O
no O
sooner O
was O
she O
out O
of O
danger O
, O
than O
, O
with O
a O
cry O
of O
thankfulness O
, O
she O
rushed O
into O
the O
expanded O
arms O
of O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
and O
fainted O
. O
When O
Marion S-PERSON
recovered O
to O
consciousness O
, O
her O
first S-ORDINAL
evidence O
of O
returning O
life O
, O
was O
the O
deep O
blush O
with O
which O
she O
extended O
her O
hand O
to O
Mr. O
Granville S-PERSON
. O
Tears O
now O
streamed O
from O
the O
blinded O
eyes O
of O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
while O
he O
spoke O
to O
her O
with O
every O
term O
of O
affectionate O
endearment O
, O
saying O
, O
in O
a O
voice O
that O
yet O
quivered O
with O
emotion O
— O
" O
My O
child O
! O
my O
dear O
Marion S-PERSON
! O
I O
thank O
God O
that O
your O
life O
, O
young O
and O
full O
of O
hope O

not O
been O
sacrificed O

keep O
my O
grey O
hairs O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
hours E-TIME

from O
the O

shattered O
now O
by O
this O
night's O
alarms O

I O
have O
little O
more O

affectionately O
embracing O

a O
torrent O
of O
joyous O

said O
Mr. O

, O
warmly O
. O
" O
I O
trust O

" O
A O
smile O
and O
a O
tear O
struggled O
hard O
for O
the O
mastery O
in O
Marion's S-PERSON
downcast O
countenance O
, O
while O
Richard S-PERSON
continued O
to O
speak O
with O
confidence O
and O
hope O
of O
the O
happy O
future O
, O
trusting O
that O
their O
engagement O

could O
not O

climate O

she O
must O
set O
out O

with O
new O
motives O
of O
hope O

while O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
expressed O
, O
in O
brief O
and O
powerful O
language O
, O
his O
fervent O
wish O
that O
nothing O
might O
interfere O
with O
a O
prospect O
which O
secured O
the O
happiness O

his O
beloved O
Marion S-PERSON

" O
Yet O
, O
" O
observed O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
next B-TIME
morning E-TIME
, O
when O
Mr. O
Granville S-PERSON
called O
to O
take O
leave O
, O
" O
I O
dislike O
long O
engagements O
, O
and O
never O
would O
recommend O
one O
. O
If O
you O
both O
remain O
constant O
, O
it O
is O
unnecessary O
, O
and O
if O
either O
of O
you O
change O
, O
it O
would O
be O
little O
worth O
to O
obtain O
from O
a O
sense O
of O
honor O
what O
should O
only O
spring O
from O
affection O

" O
" O
There O
is O
nothing O
to O
fear O
on O
that O
score O
, O
" O
replied O
Mr. O
Granville S-PERSON
, O
exchanging O
a O
smile O
with O
Marion S-PERSON
. O
" O
We O
are O
most O
apt O
in O
general O
to O
doubt O
where O
we O
have O
most O
at O
stake O
, O
but O
I O
have O
lately O
become O
almost O
presumptuously O
confident O
. O
I O
would O
not O
wish O
, O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
that O
Marion S-PERSON
should O
feel O
engaged O
one B-TIME
hour E-TIME
after O
she O
ceased O
to O
love O
me O
more O
than O
she O
could O
love O
any O
other O
, O
or O
if O
there O
were O
any O
man O
on O
earth O
who O
could O
value O
her O
more O

make O
her O
happier O

One S-CARDINAL
thing O

ask O
of O
you O
, O
dear O
Marion S-PERSON

only O
one O

added O
he O

his O
eyes O
flashing O
with O
animation O
— O

we O
meet O
again O

nothing O

in O
asking O
this O

I O
ask O
only O
what O

that O
our O
mutual O

answered O
she O

in O
a O
low O
, O
scarcely O
audible O
voice O

" O
All O
my O
happiness O

Then O
, O
as O

hope O

present O
parting O
shall O
be O
followed O
by O
a O
happy O

months S-DATE

once O
more O
hear O
your O
voice O

this O
hand O
is O
again O
clasped O
in O
mine O

" O
Marion S-PERSON
listened O
with O
a O
quivering O
smile O
on O
her O
lip O
, O
while O
a O
tear O
trembled O
in O
her O
eye O
. O
For O
a O
moment O
, O
the O
blood O
forsook O
her O
cheek O
, O
and O
returned O
again O
in O
rushing O
torrents O
over O
her O
whole O
countenance O
, O
while O
the O
eloquence O
of O
the O
heart O
was O
in O
her O
eyes O
, O
though O
she O
attempted O
not O
to O
reply O

and O
Mr. O
Granville S-PERSON
continued O
, O
in O
accents O
of O
the O
deepest O
tenderness O
, O
— O
" O
It O
grieves O
me O
more O
and O
more O
every O
day O
to O
think O
of O
leaving O
you O
, O
but O
my O
duty O
to O
Clara S-PERSON
must O
not O
be O
postponed O
any O
longer O
. O
Her O
strength O
is O
gradually O
diminishing O
, O
and O
though O
she O
does O
not O
idly O
or O
selfishly O
indulge O
her O
feelings O
, O
yet O
here O
, O
above O
all O
places O
, O
she O
seems O
least O
likely O
to O
forget O
a O
sorrow O
, O
which O
is O
, O
I O
trust O
, O
not O
incurable O

We O
, O
who O
are O
Christians S-NORP

know O
that O
there O
is O
some O
good O
purpose O

her O
affliction O

that O
the O
lightest O
straw O
which O
casts O
its O
balance O
into O
our O

is O
ordained O

the O
infinite O
power O

infinite O
goodness O

One S-CARDINAL
who O
cannot O
err O

" O
" O
Yes O
, O
" O
replied O
Marion S-PERSON
. O
" O
In O
going O
through O
life O

I O
feel O
myself O
reading O
a O
book O

the O
best O
of O
all O
authors O

Many O
of O
the O
incidents O

as O
we O
advance O

surprise O

disappoint O
us O

knowing O
that O
the O
whole O
is O
on O
a O
plan O

feel O
certain O

all O
shall O
turn O
out O
right O

best O
in O
the O
end O

" O
" O
It O
is O
a O
conviction O
such O
as O
you O
describe O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
which O
allays O
the O
torturing O

almost O
feverish O
anxiety O

kindled O

sorrowful O

better O
days O

" O
Mr. O
Granville S-PERSON
at O
length O
took O
leave O

and O
, O
as O
he O
hurried O
for O
the O
last O
time O
across O
the O
common O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
leaned O
against O
the O
window O
, O
and O
followed O
him O
with O
her O
eyes O
till O
he O
vanished O
out O
of O
sight O
| | O
while O
Sir O
Arthur's S-PERSON
countenance O
shewed O
that O
his O
kind O
heart O
was O
full O
of O
anxiety O
and O
sorrow O

for O
he O
had O
seen O
many O
vicissitudes O
in O
human O
life O

human O
attachment O
, O
therefore O
he O
trembled O
for O
the O
possibility O
of O
sorrow O
hereafter O
, O
to O
one O
whom O
he O
loved O
with O
all O
the O
unbounded O
warmth O
of O
his O
nature O
. O
Marion S-PERSON
closed O
her O
eyes O
that O
night O
with O
the O
pleasing O
conviction O
, O
that O
the O
world O
contained O
not O
a O
happier O
being O
than O
herself O
. O
She O
felt O
conscious O
how O
much O
Mr. O

had O
elevated O
her O
mind O
by O
his O
conversation O

what O

following O
him O
in O
imagination O
through O
every O

sadly O
counting O

CHAPTER O
XXXIX O
. O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
had O
heard O
, O
with O
frantic O
alarm O
, O
of O
the O
fearful O
danger O
from O
which O
Marion S-PERSON
was O
so O
wonderfully O
delivered O
| | O
and O
then O
, O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
, O
he O
discovered O
the O
whole O
depth O
and O
reality O
of O
his O
love O
. O
The O
gracefulness O
of O
every O
thought O
which O
she O
expressed O
, O
and O
the O
bright O
beauty O
of O
that O
look O
with O
which O
it O
was O
accompanied O
, O
had O
made O
an O
indelible O
impression O
on O
his O
heart O
, O
so O
that O
now O
, O
when O
he O
saw O
her O
so O
unexpectedly O
snatched O
from O
the O
jaws O
of O
death O
, O
no O
words O
could O
do O
justice O
to O
his O
emotion O
. O
He O
hurried O
that O
very O
evening O
to O
ascertain O
the O
reality O
of O
her O
escape O
, O
and O
to O
say O
what O
he O
could O
on O
the O
occasion O
| | O
while O
the O
tremulousness O
of O
his O
voice O
, O
and O
the O
quivering O
of O
his O
lip O
, O
gave O
a O
degree O
of O
depth O
and O
reality O
to O
his O
few O
incoherent O
sentences O
, O
which O
all O
his O
well O
- O
turned O
speeches O
in O
former O
times O
had O
failed O
to O
convey O

Marion S-PERSON
thanked O
him O
warmly O
for O
his O
friendly O
sympathy O
, O

spoke O
to O
him O
with O
all O
the O
intimacy O
of O
relationship O

old O
acquaintance O

when O
she O
turned O
to O
Mr. O

Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
then O
observed O
the O
flutter O
of O
her O
voice O

the O
deep O
tone O
of O
tenderness O
, O
and O
the O
look O
full O
of O
confidence O
and O
full O
of O
interest O
, O
with O
which O
she O
spoke O
to O
him O
, O

to O
him O
only O

while O
there O
was O
a O
degree O
of O
tact O

delicacy O
in O
her O
manner O
of O
testifying O
the O
wide O
disparity O
of O

feelings O

which O
left O
him O
nothing O

to O

the O
dry O

sarcastic O
air O
with O
which O
Agnes S-PERSON
watched O
his O
mortification O

Captain O

Crespigny E-PERSON
did O
not O

take O
the O
trouble O

" O
Marion S-PERSON
rushed O
through O
what O
she O
had O
to O
say O
with O
agitated O
rapidity O
, O
and O
on O
reaching O
the O
conclusion O
she O
bent O
down O
her O
head O
, O
and O
leaned O
it O
on O
her O
folded O
arms O
, O
while O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
hastily O
left O
the O
room O
, O
uttering O
a O
few O
emphatic O
exclamations O
, O
which O
were O
lost O
in O
the O
thundering O
report O
with O
which O
he O
closed O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
door O
, O
till O
it O
quivered O
upon O
the O
hinges O
. O
" O
Very O
absurd O
and O
unaccountable O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
, O
interrupting O
himself O
next B-DATE
day E-DATE
, O
during O
a O
paroxysm O
of O
angry O
whistling O
, O
which O
he O
had O
carried O
on O
for O
some O
time O
, O
standing O
with O
his O
back O
to O
the O
fire O
, O
in O
that O
attitude O
peculiar O
to O
Englishmen S-NORP
, O
and O
in O
which O
he O
was O
said O
to O
be O
the O
only O
man O
who O
ever O
looked O
graceful O
. O
" O
Most O
extraordinary O
. O
" O
" O
What O
? O
" O
asked O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
start O
of O
eager O
curiosity O
. O
" O
What O
is O
there O
which O
astonishes O
you O
so O
much O
? O
" O
" O
That O
I O
am O
the O
only O
one O
of O
our O
family O
who O
cannot O
endure O
to O
eat O
roast O
mutton O
! O
" O
replied O
he O
, O
evidently O
resolved O
to O
balk O
her O
inquisitiveness O
. O
" O
This O
is O
a O
teazing O
and O
tormenting O
world O
, O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
where O
we O
cannot O
order O
everything O
as O

" O

what O
has O
ruffled O
the O
surface O
of O
your O
humor O
to O
- O
day O
, O
Pat S-PERSON
? O
" O
asked O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
indifferently O
. O
" O
You O
seldom O
treat O
me O
to O
a O
stage O
soliloquy O

" O
" O
Then O
, O
if O
you O

it O

all O
I O
can O
say O

best O
friends O
on O

, O
Wigton S-PERSON

the O
slightest O
hopes O

" O
" O
Patrick S-PERSON
, O
you O
must O
be O
mad O
! O
If O
they O
wait O
long O
enough O

I O
may O
perhaps O
marry O
both O

at O
all O

have O
no O
intention O

refuse O
either O

" O
replied O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
in O
her O
most O
conceited O
tone O
. O
" O
Are O
you O
in O
jest O

in O

" O

both O

" O
" O
Impossible O

" O
exclaimed O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
with O
angry O
vehemence O
, O
while O
her O
eyes O
seemed O
literally O
striking O
fire O
. O
" O

no O

an O
idea O

" O
" O
No O

Marion S-PERSON

exactly O
the O

it O

" O
continued O
Sir O

, O
in O
the O
tone O
of O
an O
ill O
- O
used O
man O

thinking O
only O
of O

while O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
feeling O
herself O
extinguished O
at O
a O
blow O
, O
gazed O
in O
his O
face O
with O
a O
look O
of O
pallid O
amazement O

" O
If O

added O
Sir O

impatiently O

" O

" O
When O
a O

is O
inevitable O
, O
those O
who O
depart O
have O
generally O
the O
advantage O
, O
in O
seeing O
a O
variety O
of O
interesting O
novelties O

to O
force O
their O
attention O

occupy O
it O

while O
the O
thoughts O
of O
Mr. O
Granville S-PERSON
reverted O
continually O
to O
Harrowgate S-PERSON
, O
Marion's S-PERSON
became O
now O
more O
than O
ever O
engrossed O
with O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
whose O
nerves O
had O
been O
greatly O
shattered O
by O
his O
recent O

ardently O
longed O

health O

again O
in O
the O

sanctuary O

his O

Amidst O
scenes O
where O
she O
was O
hourly O
reminded O
of O
the O
happy O
past O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
delivered O
herself O
up O
to O
the O
pleasing O
consciousness O
of O
Richard's S-PERSON
unalterable O
attachment O
. O
Though O
circumstances O
had O
now O
separated O
, O
and O
might O
keep O
them O
apart O
for O
months S-DATE

she O
felt O
a O
steady O
assurance O
that O
their O
mutual O
attachment O
could O
never O
be O
shaken O
by O
either O
time O

distance O

In O
the O
solitude O
of O
her O
own O
heart O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
hoarded O
up O
many O
cherished O
remembrances O
of O
what O
he O
had O
said O

and O
how O
he O
had O
said O
it O

while O
the O
most O
transient O
of O
Mr. O

remarks O
seemed O
indelibly O
imprinted O
on O
her O
recollection O

She O
read O
the O
books O

liked O

practised O
the O
music O

admired O

traced O
out O
all O
his O
favorite O

lived O
with O
him O
as O
the O
continual O
companion O
of O
her O
thoughts O
. O
Marion's S-PERSON
was O
an O
unclouded O
sunshine O
of O
hope O
, O
as O
she O
confided O
so O
entirely O
in O
her O
absent O
lover O

that O
she O
would O
quite O
as O
soon O

distrusted O
her O

his O

yet O
day O

reaching O
her O
from O
either O
Clara S-PERSON

little O
did O
she O
dream O

suffering O
from O
the O
melancholy O
monotony O
of O
their O
long O
- O
continued O

that O

with O
ardent O

entire O
confidence O

had O
been O
consigned O
to O
a O
premature O
end O
by O
the O
order O

contrivance O
of O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON

but O
nevertheless O
, O
with O
all O
the O
ardor O
of O
a O
young O
and O
sanguine O
mind O
, O
she O
daily O
expected O
a O
satisfactory O
explanation O
, O

still O
looked O
back O
upon O
the O
past O

unembittered O
feelings O

not O

fanciful O
nature O

high O

generous O
in O
all O
things O

she O
had O
not O
lightly O
confided O
her O
happiness O
to O
one O
on O
whom O
she O
could O
not O
implicitly O
rely O

She O
knew O
his O
attachment O
to O
be O
one O
of O
principle O
as O
well O
as O
of O
inclination O
, O
and O
though O
uneasy O
lest O
Mr. O
Granville S-PERSON
might O
be O
ill O
, O
she O
entertained O
no O
jealous O
apprehension O
that O
he O
had O
become O
changed O
, O
but O
perseveringly O
trusted O

believed O

hoped O
the O
best O

Many O
a O
time O

Marion's S-PERSON
heart O
throbbed O

her O
color O
risen O
with O
a O
tumult O
of O
hope O

as O
she O
watched O
the O
return O
of O
Martin S-PERSON
from O
the O
post O

office O
, O
and O
the O
flutter O

expectation O
faded O
sadly O
away O

mournful O
disappointment O

sarcastically O

one O
day O

to O
take O
up O
the O
first S-ORDINAL

with O

confidence O

would O
add O
a O
pang O
to O
the O
sorrow O

separation O

believed O
ourselves O
at O
the O

every O
idle O

" O
In O
the O
mean O
time O
, O
Mr. O
Granville S-PERSON
had O
continued O
to O
write O
from O
abroad O
with O
unceasing O
assiduity O
, O
believing O
that O
some O
unexpected O
obstacle O
must O
have O
occurred O
to O
prevent O
Marion S-PERSON
from O
answering O
his O
letters O
, O
but O
never O
suspecting O
that O
she O
did O
not O
receive O
one O
of O
the O
many O
he O
had O
written O
. O
In O
his O
candid O
and O
elevated O
mind O
, O
there O
was O
no O
room O
for O
jealousy O
or O
suspicion O
, O
and O
conscious O
that O
the O
transparent O
nature O
of O
Marion's S-PERSON
nature O
admitted O
of O
no O
concealments O
, O
he O
rejected O
every O
angry O
or O
impatient O
thought O
. O
The O
more O
he O
saw O
of O
other O
society O
, O
the O
more O
dear O
she O
became O
to O
his O
memory O
now O
, O
while O
his O
attachment O
was O
of O
that O
deep O
and O
lasting O
kind O
over O
which O
the O
accidents O
of O
life O

" O
Miss O
Dunbar S-PERSON

said O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
, O
one O
evening O
, O
placing O
himself O
on O
a O
sofa O
beside O
Marion S-GPE
, O
while O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
, O
to O
whom O
he O
had O
been O
speaking O
very O
earnestly O
some O
minutes O
before O
, O
anxiously O
watched O
her O
countenance O
from O
a O
distance O
: O
" O
I O
wish O
you O
were O
now O
seated O
in O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
Merlin's S-ORG

, O
from O
which O
no O

can O
rise O

I O
have O
something O

me O
hope O
also O

" O
Of O

replied O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
faltering O
, O
agitated O
voice O
. O
" O
But O
, O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
, O
allow O
me O
to O
remark O
how O
unlikely O
it O
is O
that O
any O
subject O
can O
very O
deeply O
interest O
us O
both O

I O
trust O

hope O

fully O
understand O
each O

" O
It O
is O
time O

indeed O

replied O
he O
with O
emotion O

" O
And O
if O
I O
dare O
say O
all O
I O

it O
would O
still O
be O
less O
than O
I O
feel O
. O
Dunbar S-PERSON
assures O
me O
you O
are O
still O
at O
liberty O
to O
consult O
only O
your O
own O
inclinations O
, O
and O
let O
me O
hope O
I O
am O
not O
entirely O
the O
dupe O
of O
my O
own O
vanity O
, O
in O
believing O
that O
I O
might O
yet O
conquer O
your O
indifference O
. O
Since O
the B-TIME
hour E-TIME
when O
we O
first S-ORDINAL
met O
, O
I O
had O
eyes O
for O
no O
one O
but O
yourself O
. O
Even O
when O
we O
could O
not O
converse O
I O
have O
watched O
you O
with O
ceaseless O
interest O
, O
and O
am O
forever O
thinking O
of O
you O
in O
absence O
, O
counting O
the O
hours O
of O
my O
existence O
only O
by O
those O
passed O
in O
your O
society O
. O
Why O
, O
then O
, O
do O
you O
so O
obviously O
avoid O
me O
? O
Why O
am O
I O

ever O
made O
the O
companion O
of O
Miss O
Smythe S-PERSON

Miss O
Anybody O

else O
? O
You O
know O
and O
see O
that O
my O
whole O
object O
in O
life O
is O
, O
to O
remain O
beside O
yourself O
. O
Every O
look O
, O
word O
, O
and O
action O
tells O
you O
as O
plainly O
as O
language O
can O
speak O
, O
that O
I O
love O
you O
to O
distraction O
, O
that O
my O
attachment O
has O
not O
been O
hastily O
formed O
, O
to O
be O
as O
hastily O
laid O
aside O
, O

now O
my O
only O
apprehension O
is O
, O
that O
by O
too O
openly O
disclosing O
my O
feelings O
the O
confession O
may O
separate O
us O

ever O

it O
can O
no O
longer O
be O
delayed O

for O
I O
must O
know O
at O
once O
now O
, O
whether O
I O
am O
to O
be O
happy O

miserable O

" O
Patrick S-PERSON

done O
very O
wrong O

Marion S-PERSON

tears O
sprang O
into O
her O
eyes O

I O
told O
him O
long O

you O

is O
most O
unfortunate O

one O
of O
the O
very O
few O
who O
never O

ask O
for O
a O
heart O

a O
dark O

it O

Nothing O
is O
more O
annoying O

I O
know O

than O
the O
perseverance O
of O
an O
unrequited O
attachment O

I O
must O
cling O
to O
the O
faint O
and O
haggard O
hope O

remains O

A O
mere O
taper O
is O
extinguished O
by O
being O
blown O
upon O

a O
fire O
burns O
only O
the O
brighter O

felicity O

not O

you O

vehemence O

tone O

nothing O

Marion's S-PERSON

a O

rushed O
out O

CHAPTER O
XL O
. O
Life O
is O
indeed O
a O
complicated O
and O
mysterious O
drama O
, O
in O
which O
Agnes S-PERSON
felt O
more O
and O
more O
dissatisfied O
with O
the O
part O
she O
had O
to O
play O
. O
Harrowgate S-PERSON
had O
been O
the O
threatre O
of O
many O
interesting O
scenes O
to O
her O

now O
Lord O
Doncaster S-PERSON
had O
departed O
with O
a O
vaguely O
- O
expressed O
hope O
of O
her O
visiting O
him O
at O
Kilmarnock B-FAC
Abbey E-FAC

and O
when O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
felt O
sufficiently O
recovered O
to O
begin O
his O
long O

desired O
progress O
towards O
home O
, O
she O
slowly O
and O
sadly O
prepared O
to O
accompany O
him O
. O
Before O
they O
reached O
Portobello S-FAC
, O
winter O
had O
already O
covered O
the O
earth O
in O
a O
shroud O
of O
snow O
and O
of O
ice O

the O
birds O
no O
longer O
carolled O
gladly O
on O
the O
boughs O

the O
rustling O
leaves O
had O
ceased O
to O
fall O

the O
naked O
trees O
hung O
their O
dejected O
branches O
, O
in O
bare O
and O

desolation O

and O

barren O
fields O

. O
" O
All O
life O
and O
joyfulness O
had O
departed O
from O
the O
face O
of O
nature O
, O
which O
looked O
, O
as O
Agnes S-PERSON
remarked O
, O
like O
a O
wedding O
- O
cake O
without O
the O
ornaments O

and O
amidst O
weeks S-DATE
of O
dreary O
discontent O
, O
she O
compared O
the O
death O
- O
like O
contrast O
of O
nature O
now O
, O
from O
what O
it O
had O
been O
, O
to O
her O
own O
sadly O
altered O
feelings O
. O
She O
appeared O
constantly O
now O
to O
be O
in O
a O
state O
of O
restless O
, O
almost O
feverish O

her O

Mr. O

unaccountable O

every O
knock O

palpitate O
with O
hope O

every O
note O
brought O
into O
the O

caused O
her O
a O

of O
disappointment O

surprise O

were O

Marion's S-PERSON
was O
a O
mind O
to O
sift O
out O

enjoy O
it O

and O
her O
buoyant O
spirit O
now O
shielded O
her O
from O
a O
too O
sensitive O
apprehensiveness O
, O

she O
repelled O
the O
withering O
fears O

themselves O
on O
a O
heart O
less O

Her O
whole O
spirit O
rebelled O
against O
a O
vagrant O
thought O
of O
Richard B-PERSON
Granville's E-PERSON
inconstancy O
or O
indifference O

though O
in O
Sir O
Patrick's S-PERSON
letters O
from O
the O
continent O
, O
there O
was O
much O
that O
might O
have O
insinuated O
distrust O
into O
her O
thoughts O

but O
Marion S-PERSON
clung O
to O
the O
unswerving O
belief O
of O
her O
lover's O
infallible O
truth O
. O
She O
knew O
that O
the O
stamp O
of O
Christian S-NORP
excellence O
was O
on O
his O
whole O
character O
, O
engrained O
in O
his O
very O
being O
, O
and O
only O
to O
decay O
with O
life O
itself O
| | O
therefore O
her O
opinion O
was O
not O
at O
the O
mercy O
of O
any O
idle O
representations O
| | O
but O
the O
blast O
which O
might O
have O
uprooted O
a O
superficial O
attachment O
, O
only O
deepened O
the O
root O
of O
her O
own O
, O
which O
nothing O
could O
undermine O
. O
Mr. O
Granville S-PERSON
, O
in O
the O

time O
, O
having O
long O
ceased O
to O
hope O
for O
any O
answer O
to O
his O
letters O
, O
became O
more O
and O
more O
impatient O
for O
the O
time O
when O
he O
might O
seek O
a O
personal O
interview O
with O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
of O
whose O
constancy O
not O
a O
doubt O
ever O
crossed O
his O
imagination O
| | O
while O
day O
after O
day O
he O
watched O
with O
saddening O
apprehension O
over O
the O
declining O
health O
of O
his O
sister O
, O
whose O
failing O
strength O
required O
all O
the O
affectionate O
attentions O

lavished O
on O
her O
, O

when O
, O
after O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
weeks E-DATE
, O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
also O
arrived O
at O
Florence S-GPE

Clara S-PERSON
shrunk O
with O
blighting O
, O
heart O
- O
broken O
grief O
, O
from O
every O
engagement O
that O
might O
endanger O
her O
meeting O
him O
. O
She O
mournfully O
acknowledged O
, O
that O
having O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
esteemed O
as O
well O
as O
loved O
him O
, O
she O
was O
still O
unable O
to O
conquer O
her O
misplaced O
affection O

and O
that O
while O
nothing O
could O
induce O
her O
to O
unite O
her O
fate O
to O
Sir O
Patrick's S-PERSON
, O
or O
to O
place O
her O
happiness O
in O
his O
care O
, O
still O
the O
painful O
consciousness O
that O
he O
was O
unworthy O
and O
dishonored O
, O
weighed O
the O
more O
deeply O
upon O
her O
spirit O
, O
and O
crushed O
her O
whole O
heart O
with O
anguish O
. O
The O
constancy O
with O
which O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
tried O
to O
regain O
her O
affection O
was O
deeply O
touching O
to O
Clara's S-PERSON
young O
mind O

and O
in O
vain O
she O
tried O
to O
blot O
out O
his O
name O
with O
her O
tears O
. O
Still O
, O
Mr. O
Granville S-PERSON
, O
with O
inextinguishable O
hope O
, O
continued O
to O
believe O
that O
the O
germ O
of O
life O
must O
be O
stronger O
than O
it O
seemed O

but O
day O
after O
day O
she O
faded O
and O
drooped O
. O
Change O
of O
air O
had O
done O
less O

nothing O
for O
Clara's S-PERSON
feeble O
frame O

wasted O
strength O

while O
she O
spoke O
often O

with O
a O
smile O
of O
affectionate O
interest O

respecting O
her O
brother's O
future O

observed O
with O
emotion O

that O
her O

that O
only O
when O
talking O

now O

up O

down O

his O
eyes O
shaded O
by O
his O
long O
white O
hair O

exhibiting O
an O
expression O
of O
mournful O
solicitude O

Marion's S-PERSON
heart O
swelled O
with O
agitation O

inwardly O
moralizing O
on O
the O
officiousness O
of O
Irish S-NORP
widows O

Agnes S-PERSON
bit O
her O
beautiful O
lip O

the O
reverence O

failed O

kept O
her O
silent O

peevishly O

Sir O

with O
a O
mild O

his O

shook O
with O
emotion O

Marion S-PERSON
caught O
the O
hand O
of O
Sir O

in O
her O
own O
, O

kissed O
it O

ardent O
affection O

felt O

tightening O
in O

kindness O

in O
its O
most O
impressive O
form O

could O
excite O
no O

rose O
in O
silence O

hurried O
out O

night O

after O
Marion S-PERSON

been O
asleep O
for O
several B-TIME
hours E-TIME

suddenly O
started O
up O
in O
bed O

with O
that O
bewildered O
feeling O
of O
perplexity O
experienced O
by O
those O

unexpectedly O
aroused O

cold O

livid O
moon O

beam O

faintly O

spectral O
aspect O

A O
death O

like O
stillness O
reigned O
beside O

unable O
to O
account O
for O
having O
been O
so O
suddenly O
disturbed O

she O
was O
about O
once O
more O

consign O
herself O
to O
repose O

she O
heard O
the O
noise O

repeated O
which O
she O
had O
begun O
to O
fancy O
must O

been O
only O
a O
dream O

She O
listened O
in O
trembling O
astonishment O
, O
for O
it O
seemed O
as O
if O
in O
her O
uncle's O
room O
over O

head O

some O
persons O

up O

down O

on O

floor O

a O
sound O
sometimes O
reached O
her O
, O
as O
if O
several O
carpenters O
were O
at O
work O

Finding O
there O
was O
no O

Marion S-PERSON
sprung O
out O

threw O
on O
her O
dressing O

gown O

rushed O
up O
stairs O

having O
hastily O
thrown O
open O
the O

stood O
there O
transfixed O
for O
a O
moment O
with O
amazement O

fear O

Through O
the O
glimmering O
dawn O
of O
light O
, O
she O
saw O
that O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
was O
up O
, O
and O
completely O
dressed O
, O
while O
he O
appeared O
to O
be O
hurriedly O
groping O
about O
the O
room O
, O
as O
if O
packing O
up O
for O
a O
journey O

seemed O
unconscious O
of O
Marion's S-PERSON
entrance O

who O
stood O
for O
several B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
watching O
him O
in O
speechless O
perplexity O
and O
consternation O
, O
while O
her O
very O
blood O
forgot O
to O
flow O
, O
when O
she O
saw O
the O
stony O
look O
of O
his O
eyes O
. O
His O
countenance O
was O
of O
an O
ashy O
paleness O
, O
his O
long O
grey O
hair O
matted O
over O
his O
forehead O
, O
his O
expression O
sad O
beyond O
mortality O
, O
and O
when O
she O
took O
his O
hand O
in O
her O
own O
, O
it O
felt O
cold O
and O
damp O

His O
eyes O
wandered O
over O
her O
face O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
without O
any O
apparent O
recognition O
, O

then O
giving O
a O
smile O

utter O
vacancy O

resumed O
his O
occupation O
with O
restless O
eagerness O

" O

Marion S-PERSON

throwing O
her O
arms O
round O
him O

her O
limbs O
were O
faint O

trembled O

A O
deep O
silence O
ensued O

Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
evidently O
did O
not O
hear O
her O

His O
cold O
, O
livid O
lips O
moved O
as O
if O

not O

audible O

with O
the O

vacant O
smile O
as O
before O

turned O
away O

terror O

stricken O
Marion S-PERSON
now O
felt O
utterly O
appalled O

A O
death O
- O
like O
sickness O
came O
over O
her O
, O
horror O
and O
darkness O
seemed O
gathering O
over O
her O
mind O
, O

apprehensive O
lest O
her O
senses O
might O
entirely O
fail O

she O
hastily O
and O
vehemently O
rang O
the O
bell O
, O
calling O
loudly O
for O
assistance O

Marion's S-PERSON
was O
an O
intellect O
of O
that O
high O
tone O
which O
rises O
to O
meet O
a O
great O
emergency O
, O

though O
nearly O
paralyzed O
by O
grief O
and O
terror O
, O
when O
she O
first S-ORDINAL
saw O
the O
fearful O
, O
ghastly O
smile O
, O
with O
which O
her O
uncle O
gazed O
around O
him O
, O
she O
now O
endeavored O

by O
gentle O
persuasion O
, O
to O
make O
him O
lie O
down O
in O
his O
bed O

speaking O

accents O

recall O
his O
recollection O

impatiently O
longing O
for O

to O
appear O

and O
during O
the B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes E-TIME
that O
elapsed O
till O
he O
entered O
, O
it O
seemed O
as O
if O
time O
itself O
had O
ceased O

move O

The O
doctor O
was O
at O
length O
summoned O
, O
and O
having O
pronounced O
the O
Admiral's S-PERSON
illness O
to O
be O
caused O
by O
an O
oppression O
of O
the O
brain O
, O
threatening O
apoplexy O
, O
he O
attempted O
to O
bleed O
his O
patient O
, O
though O
almost O
without O
success O

for O
Marion S-PERSON
observed O
, O
while O
she O
held O
him O
in O
her O
arms O
, O
that O
the O
blood O
scarcely O
flowed O
, O
till O
after O
some O
time O
he O
uttered O
a O
fearful O
, O
convulsive O
cry O
, O
which O
rang O
through O
the O
room O
, O
and O
fell O
back O
in O
a O
violent O
spasm O
, O
the O
immediate O
precursor O
of O
apoplexy O
. O
Awe O
- O
struck O
and O
paralyzed O
with O
grief O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
clung O
to O
her O
uncle O
, O
and O
remained O
by O
his O
side O
, O
watching O
with O
deep O
and O
solemn O
affection O
every O
turn O
of O
his O
features O
| | O
while O
her O
cheek O
assumed O
the O
hue O
of O
death O
, O
her O
tearless O
eyes O
were O
motionless O
, O
her O
quivering O
lips O
compressed O
, O
and O
she O
remained O
as O
silent O
and O
immoveable O
as O
if O
the O
mortal O
shaft O
had O
reached O
herself O
. O
Without O
shedding O
a O
tear O
or O
breathing O
a O
sigh O
, O
she O
bent O
over O
the O
distorted O
countenance O
of O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
and O
assisted O
in O
cutting O
off O
the O
long O
white O
locks O
of O
his O
hair O
, O
which O
she O
had O
often O
loved O
to O
look O
upon O
, O
but O
which O
were O
now O
strewed O
all O
unheeded O
on O
the O
bed O
, O
and O
again O
seating O
herself O
by O
his O
side O
, O
she O
riveted O
his O
hand O
in O
her O
own O
, O
becoming O
white O
and O
motionless O
as O
an O
image O
of O
marble O
. O
Notice O
had O
been O
sent O
to O
Agnes' S-PERSON
room O
of O
the O
afflicting O
event O
which O
had O
taken O
place O
, O
and O
Marion S-PERSON
expected O
every O
instant O
that O
her O
sister O
would O
appear O
| | O
but O
time O
passed O
on O
, O
and O
she O
came O
not O
, O
being O
one O
who O
systematically O
avoided O
any O
scenes O
of O
distress O
, O
therefore O
she O
satisfied O
herself O
with O
sending O
frequent O
messages O
of O
inquiry O
to O
the O
door O
. O
At O
length O
, O
after O
some B-TIME
hours E-TIME
, O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
appeared O
to O
have O
recovered O
his O
recollection O
| | O
for O
he O
looked O
at O
Marion S-PERSON
with O
a O
feeble O
smile O
of O
deep O
affection O
, O
and O
laid O
his O
hand O
on O
her O
head O
as O
if O
to O
bless O
her O
| | O
but O
words O
were O
denied O
him O
| | O
he O
struggled O
in O
vain O
to O
speak O
| | O
and O
she O
who O
had O
not O
yet O
found O
the O
solace O
of O
a O
tear O
, O
now O
bursting O
into O
an O
irresistible O
agony O
of O
weeping O
, O
sobbed O
aloud O
. O
After O
gazing O
long O
and O
tenderly O
in O
her O
face O
, O
Sir O
Arthur's S-PERSON
eye O
-lids O
at O
length O
closed O
with O
fatigue O
, O
and O
still O
clasping O
her O
hand O
in O
his O
, O
he O
fell O
into O
a O
peaceful O
, O
quiet O
slumber O
of O
many O
hours' O
duration O
. O
Those O
who O
have O
most O
leisure O
to O
contemplate O
death O
, O
generally O
think O
least O
about O
it O
, O
and O
no O
one O
had O
ever O
meditated O
less O
on O
the O
subject O
than O
Agnes S-PERSON
. O
She O
occasionally O
remarked O
, O
when O
the O
infirmities O
of O
the O
old O
and O
the O
indigent O
were O
forced O
upon O
her O
notice O
, O
that O
they O
might O
hope O
soon O
to O
be O
released O
, O
and O
that O
to O
them O
it O
must O
, O
of O
course O
, O
be O
a O
happy O
escape O
. O
The O
busy O
and O
active O
, O
she O
thought O
, O
had O
scarcely O
time O
to O
die O
| | O
and O
, O
for O
herself O
, O
she O
considered O
death O
as O
a O
very O
unpleasant O
subject O
, O
which O
fifty B-DATE
years E-DATE
hence O
must O
be O
attended O
to O
, O
when O
the O
joys O
and O
the O
dreams O
of O
her O
present O
life O
had O
vanished O
| | O
but O
it O
seemed O
to O
her O
most O
preposterous O
now O
, O
to O
lower O
her O
spirits O
by O
melancholy O
reflections O
on O
what O
could O
not O
certainly O
be O
avoided O
, O
and O
would O
come O
only O
too O
soon O
in O
the O
end O
. O
In O
short O
, O
her O
whole O
plan O
of O
life O
was O
, O
" O
To O
- O
day O
to O
sparkle O
, O
and O
to O
- O
morrow O
die O
. O
" O
Marion S-PERSON
had O
stolen O
away O
to O
complete O
her O
midnight O
toilette O
, O
before O
she O
settled O
for O
the O
day O
beside O
Sir O
Arthur's S-PERSON
pillow O
, O
when O
she O
was O
amazed O
near O
the O
door O
to O
meet O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
hurrying O
past O
in O
travelling O
costume O
, O
and O
anxious O
, O
apparently O
, O
to O
avoid O
being O
seen O
, O
though O
, O
when O
an O
interview O
became O
inevitable O
, O
she O
tried O
to O
carry O
it O
off O
with O
careless O
audacity O
, O
being O
evidently O
in O
a O
perfect O
delirium O
of O
high O
spirits O
, O
which O
she O
vainly O
tried O
to O
conceal O
. O
" O
Well O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
! O
I O
am O
quite O
relieved O
to O
hear O
from O
Martin S-PERSON
that O
there O
is O
not O
the O
slightest O
danger O
! O
The O
doctors O
also O
say O
that O
everything O
has O
taken O
a O
favorable O
turn O
, O
though O
, O
as O
for O
their O
opinion O
, O
I O
have O
despised O
all O
physicians O
from O
Esculapius S-GPE
down O
to O
the O
magnesia O
- O
and O
- O
rhubarb O
doctors O
of O
the B-DATE
present I-DATE
day E-DATE
. O
They O
all O
tell O
us O
the O
same O
thing O
of O
an O
invalid O
, O
' O
If O
he O
does O
not O
die O
, O
he O
will O
certainly O
recover O

' O
" O
Marion S-PERSON
listened O
with O
a O
look O
of O
grave O
and O
melancholy O
surprise O
| | O
while O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
trying O
not O
to O
seem O
aware O
of O
it O
, O
and O
evidently O
anxious O
to O
avoid O
any O
reply O
, O
fixed O
her O
eyes O
on O
the O
door O
, O
as O
if O
impatient O
to O
proceed O
, O
and O
continued O
, O
in O
rapid O
accents O
of O
assumed O
bravado O
— O
" O
You O
are O
looking O
really O
ill O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
and O
must O
have O
got O
a O
dreadful O
fright O
! O
It O
would O
have O
killed O
me O
altogether O
! O
But O
make O
your O
mind O
easy O
, O
for O
these O
attacks O
are O
, O
I O
am O
told O
, O
very O
common O
. O
The B-PERSON
Duke I-PERSON
of I-PERSON
Middlesex E-PERSON
had O
ten B-CARDINAL
or I-CARDINAL
twelve E-CARDINAL

and O
people O
live O
often O
for O
years S-DATE
after O
the O
first S-ORDINAL

which O
is O
a O
great O
comfort O
. O
" O
" O
They O
do O
sometimes O
, O
but O
not O
always O
, O
" O
replied O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
with O
mournful O
gravity O
. O
" O
My O
dear O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
do O
not O
be O
too O
sanguine O
. O
This O
is O
a O
very O
serious O
attack O
. O
You O
may O
hope O
, O
but O
I O
cannot O

for O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
our O
uncle O
is O
laid O
on O
a O
bed O
from O
which O
he O
will O
never O
rise O
again O

" O
" O
Oh O
! O
you O
are O
nervous O

after O
being O
so O
frightfully O
alarmed O
this B-TIME
morning E-TIME

It O
must O
have O
been O
very O
shocking O

said O
Agnes S-PERSON

shaking O
her O
well O

arranged O
ringlets O
, O
and O
attempting O
to O
get O
up O
a O
melancholy O
look O

in O
her O
mind O
there O
never O
was O
any O
of O
that O
gentle O
, O
feminine O
apprehensiveness O
for O
others O
, O
which O
is O
so O
amiable O

so O
endearing O

" O
I O
feel O
quite O
confident O
that O
in O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE

recover O

for O
the O
present O

see O
everything O
through O
a O
darkened O
glass O

no O

added O
she O

in O
a O
tone O
of O
superior O
wisdom O

" O
Old O
people O
always O
remind O
me O

out O

away O

CHAPTER O
XLI O
. O
With O
all O
the O
acute O
susceptibilities O
of O
youth O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
now O
experienced O
, O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
, O
what O
it O
was O
to O
watch O
over O
an O
almost O
hopeless O
illness O
, O
and O
, O
with O
a O
shuddering O
sensation O
of O
unutterable O
woe O
, O
she O
tried O
to O
obtain O
that O
comfort O
from O
above O
, O
which O
nothing O
on O
earth O
could O
supply O
. O
Days O
passed O
slowly O
on O
, O
the O
longest O
and O
most O
melancholy O
she O
had O
ever O
known O
, O
while O
most O
of O
her O
hours O
were O
spent O
in O
prayer O
, O
but O
all O
around O
was O
gloom O
. O
Nothing O
could O
be O
more O
oppressive O
to O
her O
than O
the O
subdued O
whisper O
and O
stealthy O
step O
of O
Sir O
Arthur's S-PERSON
attendants O
, O
his O
vacant O
seat O
, O
his O
darkened O
room O
, O
the O
mute O
and O
solemn O
looks O
of O
his O
physician O
, O
and O
, O
above O
all O
, O
the O
inward O
anguish O
with O
which O
, O
hour B-TIME
after I-TIME
hour E-TIME
, O
she O
sat O
with O
his O
hand O
in O
hers O
, O
watching O
the O
fluctuations O
of O
his O
feeble O
pulse O
, O
observing O
with O
awe O
and O
grief O
the O
pale O
ensigns O
of O
death O
gathering O
over O
his O
features O
, O
and O
feeling O
as O
if O
every O
labored O
breath O
he O
drew O
gave O
him O
but O
a O
momentary O
reprieve O
from O
the O
grave O
, O
while O
she O
could O
not O
bear O
to O
contemplate O
the O
probability O
of O
burying O
with O
her O
beloved O
uncle O
, O
all O
the O
dear O
and O
tender O
ties O
that O
bound O
them O
to O
each O
other O
. O
With O
no O
one O
to O
console O
her O
, O
and O
nothing O
on O
earth O
to O
screen O
her O
from O
the O
desolating O
blast O
of O
grief O
, O
the O
whole O
fabric O
of O
her O
worldly O
happiness O
seemed O
crumbling O
to O
dust O
. O
Her O
heart O
was O
like O
an O
exhausted O
receiver O
, O
and O
her O
spirit O
sank O
, O
yet O
no O
inducement O
could O
have O
withdrawn O
her O
for O
an B-TIME
hour E-TIME
from O
that O
scene O
of O
solemn O
, O
deep O
, O
and O
awful O
melancholy O
. O
Throughout O
the O
long O
, O
dreary O
hours B-TIME
of I-TIME
night E-TIME
, O
each O
of O
which O
seemed O
an O
eternity O
of O
anxious O
care O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
felt O
too O
deeply O
impressed O
with O
the O
solemnity O
around O
for O
the O
indulgence O
of O
any O
violent O
emotion O
. O
Nothing O
is O
so O
silent O
as O
intense O
feeling O
! O
Stunned O
and O
stupified O
by O
the O
sudden O
affliction O
, O
a O
wild O
chaos O
of O
sorrow O
, O
fear O
, O
and O
amazement O
rushed O
through O
her O
young O
mind O
, O
filling O
her O
with O
agony O
, O
which O
tears O
could O
not O
relieve O
| | O
but O
now O
was O
the O
time O
for O
that O
supernatural O
aid O
given O
by O
Divine O
grace O
to O
the O
humble O
, O
believing O
Christian S-NORP
. O
In O
silent O
, O
speechless O
prayer O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
found O
her O
first S-ORDINAL
and O
only O
relief O
| | O
then O
she O
felt O
that O
her O
heart O
was O
read O
, O
and O
her O
sorrows O
pitied O
, O
by O
One O
who O
has O
shared O
every O
human O
grief O
, O
carried O
every O
human O
sorrow O
, O
and O
to O
whom O
the O
suffering O
sinner O
never O
applies O
in O
vain O
. O
One B-TIME
morning E-TIME
, O
the O
grey O
light O
of O
dawn O
stole O
through O
a O
crevice O
of O
the O
shutters O
, O
while O
, O
in O
her O
lonely O
silence O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
felt O
as O
if O
the O
whole O
world O
were O
in O
a O
trance O
, O
and O
not O
a O
sound O
was O
heard O
, O
but O
the O
slow O
ticking O
of O
the O
clock O
, O
reminding O
her O
that O
time O
and O
death O
are O
forever O
advancing O
. O
She O
sat O
watching O
every O
minute O
change O
of O
that O
beloved O
countenance O
shattered O
by O
sickness O
, O
and O
evidently O
sinking O
in O
decay O
, O
when O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
unexpectedly O
opened O
his O
eyes O
, O
which O
once O
more O
beamed O
with O
intelligence O
, O
as O
he O
fixed O
them O
with O
a O
look O
of O
touching O
mournfulness O
on O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
and O
called O
her O
by O
name O
. O
That O
voice O
, O
which O
had O
so O
long O
been O
dear O
to O
her O
, O
now O
sounded O
strange O
and O
unnatural O
, O
being O
palsied O
by O
weakness O
, O
while O
the O
glassiness O
of O
the O
grave O
was O
in O
his O
eye O
| | O
but O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
forcibly O
subduing O
all O
appearance O
of O
emotion O
, O
stooped O
down O
, O
and O
, O
with O
a O
momentary O
gleam O
of O
hope O
, O
kissed O
his O
pale O
forehead O
. O
" O
Marion S-PERSON
! O
we O
have O
loved O
each O
other O
well O
, O
" O
said O
he O
feebly O
, O
extending O
his O
hand O
to O
her O
. O
" O
For O
your O
sake O
I O
would O
stay O
, O
old O
and O
weary O

far O

Before O

clock O
strikes O
again O

I O
shall O
be O
in O
a O
better O
world O

" O
Marion S-PERSON
covered O
her O
face O
with O
her O
hands O
and O
attempted O
not O
to O
speak O
, O
for O
she O
saw O
that O
the O
sure O
hand O
of O
time O
, O
and O
the O
heavier O
hand O
of O
sorrow O
, O
had O
indeed O
done O
their O
work O
. O
It O
was O
but O
too O
evident O
that O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
would O
never O
see O
another O
night O
, O
for O
he O
was O
about O
to O
awaken O
in O
the O
mighty O
dawn O
of O
eternity O
, O
where O
no O
darkness O
ever O
would O
follow O
. O
The O
frail O
, O
old O
, O
worn O
- O
out O
tenement O
of O
his O
body O
, O
so O
full O
of O
infirmities O
, O
was O
now O
to O
enter O
its O
rest O

his O
head O
, O
whitened O
with O
age O
and O
suffering O
, O
had O
been O
anointed O
with O
peace O
, O
and O
, O
having O
partaken O
with O
cheerful O
thankfulness O
of O
the O
banquet O
of O
life O
, O
he O
was O
evidently O
willing O
to O
make O
way O
, O
that O
others O
might O
fill O
his O
place O
| | O
not O
disgusted O
or O
dissatisfied O
with O
existence O
, O
but O
thankful O
that O
he O
had O
tasted O
better O
joys O
than O
those O
of O
earth O
, O
and O
desiring O
to O
enjoy O
them O
at O
last O
in O
never O
- O
ending O
perfection O

A O
mysterious O
conviction O
is O
generally O
given O
to O
the O
dying O
, O
when O
their O
disease O
becomes O

but O
though O
nature O
shrank O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
from O
the O
solemn O

supported O
the O
powerful O
mind O
of O
Sir O

added O

in O
a O
tone O

" O
With O
a O
face O
livid O
as O
death O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
choked O
back O
her O
sobs O
and O
restrained O
her O
tears O
, O
while O
she O
listened O
to O
every O
faltering O
word O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
said O
, O
as O
if O
her O
life O
depended O
on O
hearing O
him O
. O
When O
he O
became O
silent O
from O
exhaustion O
, O
she O
attempted O
to O
whisper O
a O
few O
broken O
expressions O
of O
grief O
and O
affection O
in O
his O
ear O
. O
Unable O
, O
however O
, O
to O
think O
or O
speak O
under O
the O
weight O
of O
her O
sorrow O
, O
she O
might O
have O
been O
mistaken O
for O
a O
corpse O
, O
but O
for O
the O
look O
of O
living O
agony O
in O
her O
eye O
, O
while O
struggling O
with O
a O
sorrow O
which O
tears O
or O
lamentations O
could O
not O
have O
expressed O
, O
and O
could O
not O
have O
relieved O
. O
At O
length O
Sir O
Arthur's S-PERSON
breathing O
became O
uncertain O
— O
his O
majestic O
chest O
heaved O
convulsively O
— O
a O
damp O
, O
cold O
dew O
broke O
out O
on O
his O
forehead O
— O
the O
heart O
which O
had O
beat O
with O
every O
kind O
and O
noble O
emotion O
, O
could O
beat O
no O
more O
— O
and O
, O
giving O
a O
last O
glance O
of O
fond O
affection O
at O
Marion S-GPE
, O
a O
grey O
, O
ashy O
hue O
stole O
over O
his O
features O
, O
and O
his O
countenance O
assumed O
that O
strange O
, O
peculiar O
aspect O
which O
is O
seen O
in O
death O
, O
and O
in O
death O
only O
. O
Marion S-PERSON
saw O
it O
, O
and O
long O
afterwards O
that O
look O
was O
forever O
before O
her O
sight O
. O
Nothing O
in O
all O
the O
earth O
is O
so O
unutterly O
sublime O
as O
death O
. O
Strange O
and O
solemn O
was O
the O
mysterious O
horror O
, O
the O
inexplicable O
wonder O
, O
with O
which O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
, O
witnessed O
the O
soul O
forsaking O
its O
earthly O
tabernacle O
. O
Day O
after O
day O
, O
when O
she O
returned O
to O
watch O
beside O
all O
that O
now O
remained O
of O
her O
earliest O
and O
kindest O
friend O
, O
while O
her O
heart O
seemed O
scorched O
and O
seared O
with O
grief O
, O
she O
gazed O
on O
the O
mortal O
form O
in O
ruins O
before O
her O
— O
its O
light O
extinguished O
— O
its O
tenant O
departed O
— O
its O
whole O
nature O
in O
a O
moment O
transformed O
— O
and O
, O
forgetting O
sometimes O
for O
a O
moment O
her O
own O
grief O
, O
her O
loneliness O
, O
her O
deep O
and O
fearful O
bereavements O
, O
she O
thought O
but O
of O
that O
purified O
spirit O
now O
emancipated O
into O
the O
regions O
of O
eternal O
glory O
, O
and O
almost O
longed O
for O
the O
period O
when O
she O
also O
might O
become O
as O
indifferent O
to O
things O
of O
time O
as O
the O
inanimate O
corpse O
beside O
her O
. O
Often O
, O
however O
, O
she O
tried O
, O
with O
an O
eye O
of O
faith O
, O
to O
look O
beyond O
the O
portals O
of O
the O
tomb O
, O
remembering O
that O
death O
is O
to O
a O
Christian S-NORP
, O
like O
the O
setting O
of O
the O
sun O
, O
for O
while O
lost O
to O
human O
sight O
, O
he O
still O
exists O
and O
shines O
with O
unfading O
glory O
and O
everlasting O
brightness O
. O
When O
Sir O
Arthur's S-PERSON
remains O
were O
placed O
in O
the O
coffin O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
felt O
as O
if O
the O
last O
link O
were O
severed O
between O
them O
. O
His O
better O
part O
had O
, O
indeed O
, O
already O
departed O
, O
but O
the O
cold O
image O
before O
her O
was O
still O
associated O
with O
all O
she O
had O
ever O
known O
of O
happiness O
or O
affection O
, O
yet O
, O
in O
the O
strong O
agony O
of O
her O
grief O
, O
when O
all O
seemed O
a O
gloomy O
chaos O
of O
solitary O
desolation O
, O
she O
felt O
consoled O
by O
reflecting O
that O
her O
own O
devoted O
care O
had O
assisted O
in O
smoothing O
his O
passage O
to O
the O
grave O
| | O
and O
she O
could O
not O
but O
think O
how O
great O
must O
be O
the O
joys O
of O
another O
world O
, O
when O
such O
affliction O
as O
her's O
was O
not O
worthy O
to O
be O
compared O
with O
them O
. O
A O
wide O
horizon O
of O
sorrow O
seemed O
before O
her O
, O
long O
days O
of O
loneliness O
and O
longer O
nights O
of O
grief O
| | O
while O
, O
though O
young O
in O
years S-DATE
, O
she O
already O
felt O
old O
in O
affliction O
, O
for O
a O
blight O
and O
a O
mildew O
were O
upon O
her O
spirit O
. O
Marion's S-PERSON
sanguine O
mind O
and O
ardent O
feelings O
had O
nothing O
near O
her O
on O
which O
to O
rest O
, O
the O
whole O
energy O
of O
her O
being O
, O
for O
the O
time O
, O
seemed O
crushed O
and O
withered O
| | O
the O
future O
appeared O
to O
stretch O
before O
her O
mind O
in O
a O
long O
vista O
of O
moving O
shadows O
, O
and O
the O
memory O
of O
past O
happiness O
, O
like O
gold O
in O
the O
hand O
of O
a O
drowning O
man O
, O
sank O
her O
only O
the O
deeper O
in O
grief O
. O
Her O
beloved O
uncle O
seemed O
still O
to O
be O
everywhere O
— O
yet O
she O
saw O
him O
not O
. O
In O
all O
the O
earth O
there O
was O
not O
a O
thought O
which O
did O
not O
pierce O
her O
, O
or O
a O
worldly O
hope O
which O
did O
not O
now O
bring O
an O
icy O
chilliness O
to O
her O
heart O
— O
for O
a O
dark O
cloud O
had O
fallen O
between O
her O
and O
all O
those O
whose O
affection O
once O
adorned O
her O
existence O
. O
It O
was O
now O
that O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
like O
a O
tempest O
- O
tossed O
vessel O
, O
surrounded O
by O
darkness O
and O
fear O
, O
turned O
for O
direction O
and O
help O
to O
that O
steady O
and O
benignant O
light O
burning O
at O
a O
distance O
, O
which O
alone O
could O
direct O
her O
into O
a O
haven O
of O
rest O
. O
Her O
sorrow O
became O
gradually O
illuminated O
by O
hope O
and O
peace O
. O
She O
clung O
to O
every O
shattered O
wreck O
of O
happiness O
which O
remained O
, O
and O
sinking O
on O
her O
knees O
, O
she O
felt O
that O
no O
one O
could O
ever O
be O
completely O
alone O
, O
or O
completely O
miserable O
, O
who O
rightly O
used O
the O
privilege O
of O
speaking O
her O
wishes O
in O
prayer O
to O
that O
great O
and O
holy O
Being O
, O
who O
is O
the O
father O
and O
the O
friend O
of O
all O
his O
earth O
- O
born O
children O
. O
Marion S-PERSON
had O
long O
believed O
that O
the O
happiest O
life O
is O
that O
most O
conformed O
to O
the O
will O
of O
God O
— O
that O
grief O
arises O
from O
not O
believing O
whatever O
is O
appointed O
to O
be O
really O
best O
| | O
and O
now O
she O
found O
in O
the O
Bible S-WORK_OF_ART
that O
comfort O
which O
is O
nowhere O
else O
to O
be O
gained O
. O
The O
deepest O
emotions O
of O
this O
world O
remain O
unseen O
and O
unknown O
to O
all O
around O
| | O
for O
the O
strength O
of O
character O
which O
gives O
power O
to O
feel O
, O
gives O
power O
also O
to O
hide O
, O
and O
there O
is O
a O
modesty O
in O
real O
sensibility O
, O
which O
admits O
not O
of O
display O

but O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
cut O
off O
now O
from O
all O
the O
tenderest O
sympathies O
of O
life O
, O
became O
the O
more O
zealous O
and O
diligent O
in O
preparing O

CHAPTER O
XLII O
. O
At O
Florence S-GPE
, O
Clara B-GPE
Granville E-GPE
lingered O
and O
recovered O
, O
and O
lingered O
again O
, O
sleeping O
little O
, O
eating O
nothing O
, O
and O
patiently O
trying O
every O
remedy O
, O
though O
she O
herself O
was O
without O
hope O
of O
recovery O
, O
till O
at O
length O
, O
decorated O
in O
all O
the O
radiant O
coloring O
and O
bright O
beauty O
of O
consumption O
, O
she O
sank O
slowly O
but O
surely O
, O
evidently O
hastening O
to O
the O
grave O
, O
though O
still O
Mr. O
Granville S-PERSON
, O
with O
the O
tenacity O
of O
affection O
, O
continued O
to O
hope O
, O
and O
still O
he O
told O
himself O
that O
she O
might O
, O
perhaps O
, O
yet O
be O
spared O
. O
Day O
after O
day O
he O
sat O
beside O
her O
couch O
, O
reading O
, O
conversing O
, O
and O
praying O
with O
her O
, O
while O
his O
brotherly O
attachment O
seemed O
to O
grow O
only O
the O
more O
engrossing O
and O
considerate O
the O
longer O
she O
needed O
his O
care O
| | O
but O
it O
became O
evident O
to O
all O
around O
, O
that O
his O
cares O
and O
hopes O
on O
her O
account O
were O
drawing O
to O
a O
close O
, O
and O
that O
his O
sorrow O
must O
soon O
be O
without O
hope O
in O
a O
present O
world O
, O
though O
full O
of O
hope O
in O
a O
world O
to O
come O
. O
Letters O
now O
reached O
Mr. O
Granville S-PERSON
, O
announcing O
that O
his O
long O
- O
pending O
law O
- O
suit O
had O
been O
at O
length O
finally O
decided O
in O
his O
favor O
, O
giving O
him O
an O
income O
more O
than O
equal O
to O
his O
utmost O
desires O
| | O
but O
letters O
far O
more O
deeply O
interesting O
to O
his O
feelings O
still O
were O
missing O
. O
Often O
and O
anxiously O
had O
he O
watched O
for O
a O
single O
line O
from O
Marion S-GPE
, O
yet O
so O
well O
had O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
arranged O
the O
measures O
which O
, O
as O
her O
guardian O
, O
he O
persuaded O
himself O
it O
might O
be O
allowable O
to O
take O
, O
in O
order O
to O
intercept O
her O
correspondence O
, O
that O
not O
a O
single O
letter O
ever O
escaped O
the O
vigilance O
of O
his O
emissaries O
| | O
and O
Mr. O
Granville S-PERSON
, O
though O
he O
still O
cherished O
, O
as O
his O
best O
earthly O
treasure O
, O
the O
belief O
of O
Marion's S-PERSON
attachment O
, O
felt O
so O
painfully O
perplexed O
respecting O
her O
, O
and O
so O
grieved O
for O
Clara S-PERSON
, O
that O
the O
almost O
unexpected O
change O
in O
his O
circumstances O
appeared O
scarcely O
worth O
a O
thought O
, O
while O
a O
dense O
curtain O
of O
sorrow O
seemed O
gathered O
around O
his O
spirits O
. O
If O
the O
vital O
spark O
of O
his O
own O
existence O
had O
been O
about O
to O
expire O
, O
Richard S-PERSON
could O
scarcely O
have O
felt O
more O
deeply O
than O
now O
, O
beside O
the O

took O
his O
hand O
in O
her O

one O
day O
, O

a O
fixed O
expression O
of O
tenderness O

grief O
appeared O
in O
her O

there O
was O
a O
melting O
softness O
in O
her O
voice O

she O
said O
: O

" O
Mr. O
Granville S-PERSON
kissed O
his O
sister's O
forehead O
with O
deep O
and O
solemn O
affection O
, O
while O
his O
cheek O
became O
pale O
and O
his O
lip O
quivered O

but O
his O
heart O
was O
too O
full O
to O
reply O
, O
and O
Clara S-PERSON
proceeded O
: O
" O
We O
have O
saved O
ourselves O
much O
unnecessary O
anxiety O
by O
placing O
a O
firm O

said O
Clara S-PERSON
, O
fixing O
her O
large O
, O
mournful O
eyes O
on O
him O

slowly O
closing O
them O
as O
she O
faintly O
added O
, O
" O

died O
without O

Clara S-PERSON
hesitated O

the O
hectic O
color O
deepened O
on O
her O
transparent O
cheek O
, O
her O
lip O
trembled O
, O

she O
became O
silent O
, O

Richard S-PERSON
took O
her O
hand O
in O
his O
own O
, O

listened O
with O
affectionate O
anxiety O
for O
what O
was O
to O
follow O

it O
came O
not O

With O
a O
look O
of O
desolate O
grief O
Clara S-PERSON
turned O
away O
her O
head O

was O
silent O

while O
Mr. O
Granville S-PERSON
, O
using O
every O
term O
of O
affectionate O
endearment O
, O
entreated O
her O
not O
to O
let O
him O
suppose O
there O
was O
a O
wish O
of O
her O
heart O
unspoken O
, O
or O
a O
desire O
which O
he O
could O
grant O
unfulfilled O
. O
After O
a O
short O
struggle O
, O
during O
which O
he O
was O
alarmed O
by O
the O
greatness O
of O
her O
emotion O
, O
she O
seemed O
at O
length O
to O
have O
entirely O
conquered O
her O
feelings O
, O
and O
said O
in O
a O
perfectly O
calm O
, O
unimpassioned O
voice O
— O

letter O

added O

raising O
herself O
up O

sudden O
energy O

clasping O
his O

him O

carry O
to O

no O

a O
source O

both O

of O
real O

advantage O

me O

a O
final O
effort O
of O
life O

leave O
in O

grief O

now O
became O
almost O

was O

her O

grew O
cold O
within O
his O
own O

and O
the O
glassy O
fixedness O
of O
her O
eye O
carried O
death O

his O

He O
felt O

, O
at O

Mr. O

, O
forgetful O
, O
apparently O
, O
of O

tried O
now O
to O
impart O
consolation O
from O
that O

of O
sublime O
peace O

everlasting O
hope O

the O
Christian S-NORP

for O
, O
though O
his O
own O
feelings O
were O
lacerated O
and O
torn O
with O
a O
sorrow O
that O
seemed O
as O
sudden O
as O
if O
he O
had O
never O
till O
now O
expected O
it O
, O
still O
there O
was O
a O
balm O
for O
his O
wounded O
spirit O
, O
which O
soothed O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
anguish O
of O
his O
sufferings O
, O
and O
would O
at O
last O
, O
he O
knew O
, O
bring O
him O
daily S-DATE
more O
abundant O
consolation O

No O
affliction O
seems O
to O
come O
so O
directly O
from O
the O
hand O
of O
God O
as O
the O
death O
of O
those O
who O
have O
been O
so O
truly O
loved O

in O
contemplating O
the O
wide O
gulf O
which O
now O
divided O
him O
from O
Clara S-PERSON
, O
the O
manly O
spirit O
of O
Mr. O
Granville S-PERSON
was O
overpowered O
with O
grief O
. O
This O
seemed O
a O
moment O
too O
awful O
for O
vehement O
sorrow O
. O
He O
had O
watched O
the O
last O
struggle O
of O
existence O
in O
one O
with O
whom O
every O
thought O
and O
emotion O
were O
hitherto O
shared O
, O
and O
now O
, O
while O
her O
beloved O
and O
well O
- O
known O
features O
remained O
the O
same O
, O
all O
intercourse O

all O
sympathy O
between O
them O
had O
at O
once O
been O
closed O

and O
, O
in O
the O
hours O
of O
solemn O
contemplation O
which O
followed O
, O
Richard S-PERSON
felt O
more O
than O
ever O
a O
desire O
to O
learn O
what O
is O
seen O
and O
felt O
when O
the O
gloomy O
curtain O
of O
life O
is O
withdrawn O
, O
and O
the O
glories O
of O

revealed O

, O
checking O
the O
speculations O
of O
a O
vain O
curiosity O
, O
he O
opened O
the O
pages O
of O
holy O
inspiration O
, O
there O
to O
find O
an O
inexhaustible O
fund O
of O
sublime O
and O
elevating O
comfort O
, O
convinced O
that O
, O
to O
have O
his O
affliction O
sanctified O
, O
was O
even O
better O
than O
to O
have O
it O
removed O
. O
The O
sympathy O
established O
between O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
and O
Mr. O
Granville S-PERSON
now O
brought O
them O
daily S-DATE
together O
, O
when O
the O
young O
Baronet S-PERSON
learned O
, O
in O
such O
society O
, O
to O
venerate O
and O
admire O
that O
holy O
faith O
, O
which O
as O
yet O
he O
could O
neither O
feel O
nor O
comprehend O
| | O
and O
every O
hour O
he O
became O
more O
conscious O
of O
its O
happy O
effects O
on O
the O
mind O
and O
heart O
of O
Richard B-PERSON
Granville E-PERSON
, O
who O
seemed O
always O
ready O
to O
forget O
every O
selfish O
thought O
, O
when O
the O
glory O
of O
God O
or O
the O
good O
of O
others O
claimed O
his O
most O
arduous O
and O
zealous O
devotion O

and O
even O
his O
grief O
for O
Clara S-PERSON
, O
deep O
and O
agonizing O
as O
it O
was O
, O
found O
a O
vent O
in O
the O
most O
implicit O
attention O
to O
all O
her O
wishes O
, O
and O
especially O
to O
her O
injunctions O
respecting O
the O
restoration O
of O
his O
friendly O
intercourse O
with O

CHAPTER O
XLIII O
. O
There O
is O
said O
to O
be O
a O
stage O
in O
sorrow O
, O
after O
which O
an O
addition O
can O
be O
borne O
with O
apathy O
| | O
but O
this O
the O
heart O
of O
Marion S-PERSON
seemed O
never O
likely O
to O
reach O
. O
It O
is O
a O
natural O
source O
of O
comfort O
, O
however O
, O
in O
mourning O
over O
the O
loss O
of O
those O
we O
love O
, O
to O
find O
that O
they O
are O
appreciated O
and O
lamented O
by O
others O
| | O
and O
many O
kind O
letters O
of O
condolence O
on O
the O
death O
of O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
reached O
the O
young O
mourner O
, O
from O
old O
companions O
and O
young O
acquaintances O
. O
Some O
were O
written O
with O
overdone O
and O
inflated O
expressions O
of O
sorrow O
, O
as O
if O
the O
writer O
had O
lost O
a O
parent O
of O
her O
own O
| | O
and O
if O
the O
occasion O
had O
been O
less O
heartbreaking O
to O
herself O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
might O
almost O
have O
smiled O
at O
their O
tone O
of O
exaggerated O
grief O
. O
Others O
wrote O
studied O
compositions O
, O
so O
beautifully O
got O
up O
, O
and O
with O
such O
skilfully O
turned O
periods O
, O
that O
the O
writer O
must O
have O
felt O
certain O

hereafter O
collected O
and O
published O

while O
others O
concluded O
with O
" O
Yours O
, O
in O
haste O
, O
" O
as O
an O
evident O
apology O
for O
neither O
head O
nor O
heart O
being O
much O
enlisted O
on O
the O
occasion O

but O
all O
were O
received O
with O
grateful O
interest O
, O
being O
more O
or O
less O
a O
proof O
of O
kind O
intentions O
, O
very O
soothing O
to O
the O
feelings O
of O
a O
solitary O
girl O
. O
Each O
letter O
, O
as O
it O
came O
, O
caused O
her O
a O
palpitation O
of O
hope O
, O
followed O
by O
a O
pang O
of O
disappointment O
| | O
for O
every O
morning O
she O
arose O
with O
a O
confident O
hope O
that O
now O
Richard B-PERSON
Granville E-PERSON
must O
certainly O
write O
, O
and O
every O
evening O
closed O
in O
with O
an O
added O
weight O
of O
discouragement O
and O
sorrow O
| | O
for O
now O
indeed O
the O
roses O
of O
life O
seemed O
all O
to O
have O
faded O
, O
and O
the O
thorns O
only O
to O
remain O
. O
As O
Shakspeare S-PERSON
observes O
, O
" O
every O
one O
can O
master O
a O
grief O

commonplace O

came O
to O
gossip O
over O
the O
sorrows O

Marion S-PERSON

to O
ascertain O
exactly O
how O

Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON

left O

there O

not O
one O

she O
could O
unveil O
her O
feelings O
. O
Each O
of O
her O
well O
- O
intentioned O
visitors O
said O
a O
few O
words O
in O
praise O
of O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
enough O
to O
convince O
Marion S-PERSON
that O
no O
one O
but O
herself O
could O
appreciate O
the O
hundredth S-ORDINAL
part O
of O
his O
inestimable O
worth O
— O
a O
sentence O
or O
two S-CARDINAL

followed O
of O
pious O
reflection O
, O
obviously O
spoken O
with O
restraint O
, O
and O
picked O
up O
by O
rote O
from O
some O
volume O
of O
religious O
meditations O
, O
and O
the O
whole O
was O
generally O
concluded O
in O
a O
masterly O
manner O
, O
by O
repeating O
a O
few O
texts O
of O
Scripture S-WORK_OF_ART
, O
strung O
together O
from O
a O
concordance O

There O
is O
a O
solemn O
dignity O
in O
real O
grief O

beside O
which O
all O
commonplace O

trifling O
consolations O
fall O
powerless O

strangers O
in O
return O
for O
their O
contributions O
of O
sympathy O

expected O

Marion S-PERSON

ostentatious O
display O
of O
affection O

Marion S-PERSON

over O
the O
abyss O

thread O

grows O
more O
feeble O
every O

most O
heavily O
, O
and O
as O
day O
after O
day O
passed O
slowly O
onwards O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
felt O
more O
and O
more O
astonished O
to O
hear O
nothing O
of O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
written O
but O
once O
, O
a O
very O
few O
days O
after O
her O
departure O
from O
home O
, O
in O
gay O
and O
almost O
triumphant O
spirits O
, O
boasting O
of O
the O
excessive O
attention O
she O
met O
with O
from O
all O
the O
party O
, O
of O
the O
splendor O
in O
which O
they O
travelled O
, O
of O
the O
admiration O
she O
had O
herself O
excited O
, O
and O
of O
several O
magnificent O
presents O
she O
had O
received O
from O
Lord O
Doncaster S-PERSON
. O
In O
a O
postscript O
to O
this O
letter O
, O
she O
expressed O
a O
careless O
, O
patronizing O
hope O
, O
that O
poor O
, O
dear O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
was O
now O
convalescent O
| | O
and O
as O
for O
anything O
but O
a O
recovery O
, O
she O
seemed O
no O
more O
to O
doubt O
it O
than O
if O
death O
had O
been O
altogether O
abolished O
. O
To O
Marion's S-PERSON
surprise O
, O
when O
looking O
at O
the O
signature O
of O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
a O
broad O
line O
had O
been O
drawn O
through O
the O
name O
of O
Dunbar S-PERSON
, O
and O
the O
whole O
was O
surrounded O
by O
a O
fantastic O
wreath O
of O
flourishes O
, O
exactly O
imitating O
the O
very O
peculiar O
way O
in O
which O
Lord O
Doncaster S-PERSON
was O
accustomed O
usually O
to O
encircle O
his O
own O
autograph O
| | O
and O
much O
she O
marvelled O
what O
this O
uncommon O
device O
was O
intended O
to O
indicate O
, O
though O
she O
secretly O
dreaded O
to O
hear O
the O
interpretation O
of O
it O
, O
which O
her O
fears O
had O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
suggested O
. O
As O
the O
mind O
and O
heart O
become O
more O
matured O
in O
this O
world O
, O
they O
too O
often O
become O
, O
from O
sad O
experience O
, O
more O
apprehensive O
of O
evil O
, O
and O
more O
suspicious O
of O
earthly O
friendships O
| | O
but O
it O
was O
otherwise O
with O
Marion S-PERSON
in O
respect O
to O
Richard B-PERSON
Granville E-PERSON
| | O
though O
a O
dark O
curtain O
had O
fallen O
suddenly O
between O
them O
, O
all O
intercourse O
was O
most O
unaccountably O
suspended O
, O
and O
the O
very O
thought O
of O
his O
attachment O
, O
once O
a O
pleasure O
without O
alloy O
, O
was O
now O
accompanied O
by O
a O
heavy O
, O
leaden O
depression O
and O
anxiety O
. O
She O
told O
herself O
a B-CARDINAL
thousand E-CARDINAL
times O
over O
that O
all O
would O
hereafter O
be O
explained O
, O
and O
yet O
her O
heart O
seemed O
turning O
to O
stone O
, O
while O
day O
after O
day O
dawned O
and O
closed O
without O
a O
line O
to O
give O
her O
comfort O
or O
to O
reassure O
her O
heart O
. O
In O
this O
state O
of O
wearing O
suspense O
a O
visiting O
card O
was O
brought O
to O
Marion S-GPE
one B-TIME
morning E-TIME
of O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny's E-PERSON
, O
accompanied O
by O
a O
letter O
which O
he O
had O
brought O
from O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
, O
strongly O
urging O
on O
her O
, O
in O
almost O
arbitrary O
terms O
, O
his O
earnest O
desire O
that O
she O
should O
reconsider O
her O
decision O
against O
her O
friend O
, O
and O
no O
longer O
wasting O
her O
affections O
on O
a O
penniless O
curate O
, O
who O
had O
proved O
himself O
undeserving O
of O
her O
, O
— O
bestow O
them O
where O
they O
would O
be O
so O
much O
better O
appreciated O
, O
and O
where O
they O
would O
exalt O
her O
to O
so O
distinguished O
a O
situation O
. O
Marion S-PERSON
was O
astonished O
to O
think O
how O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
could O
know O
that O
she O
had O
any O
cause O
of O
dissatisfaction O
against O
Mr. O
Granville S-PERSON
, O
whom O
she O
had O
never O
even O
named O
of O
late O
| | O
but O
resolute O
if O
possible O
to O
avoid O
meeting O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
, O
she O
was O
denied O
again O
and O
again O
when O
he O
called O
, O
though O
to O
her O
surprise O
he O
persevered O
in O
almost O
daily O
inquiring O
for O
her O
, O
and O
numbered O
his O
visiting O
cards O
conspicuously O
on O
the O
corner O
till O
they O
amounted O
at O
last O
to O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
a I-CARDINAL
dozen E-CARDINAL
. O
Marion S-PERSON
was O
sitting O
alone O
one B-TIME
evening E-TIME
, O
beside O
her O
solitary O
hearth O
, O
and O
to O
a O
spectator O
she O
would O
have O
seemed O
of O
more O
than O
earthly O
beauty O
, O
though O
the O
cold O
tear O
stood O
unheeded O
on O
her O
cheek O
, O
while O
her O
memory O
had O
become O
haunted O
by O
the O
ghost O
of O
departed O
happiness O
. O
She O
thought O
of O
her O
deceased O
uncle O
in O
his O
silent O
grave O
, O
yet O
it O
seemed O
as O
if O
still O
she O
could O
trace O
his O
step O
and O
hear O
his O
voice O
by O
her O
side O
. O
All O
was O
still O
as O
death O
, O
her O
soul O
seemed O
wandering O
in O
a O
mysterious O
existence O
, O
amidst O
the O
solitary O
and O
deserted O
world O
, O
and O
hope O
itself O
grew O
dim O
within O
her O
breast O
. O
The O
flood O
- O
gates O
of O
memory O
were O
now O
unclosed O
, O
pouring O
into O
her O
heart O
and O
spirit O
a O
ceaseless O
stream O
of O
old O
recollections O
, O
old O
scenes O
, O
and O
recent O
sorrows O
| | O
while O
the O
bright O
mirror O
of O
joy O
which O
had O
once O
shone O
in O
radiant O
splendor O
before O
her O
eyes O
seemed O
now O
broken O
to O
shivers O
. O
No O
one O
seemed O
destined O
hereafter O
to O
know O
the O
deep O
mine O
of O
thoughts O
and O
affections O
which O
lay O
unspoken O
in O
her O
breast O
. O
She O
felt O
as O
if O
the O
summer O
might O
shine O
in O
its O
brightness O
, O
the O
spring O
might O
be O
gay O
with O
the O
blossoms O
of O
hope O
, O
but O
that O
her O
spring O
and O
summer O
would O
return O
in O
this O
world O
no O
more O
, O
yet O
she O
believed O
and O
knew O
that O
it O
was O
better O
to O
witness O
the O
death O
of O
every O
dear O
affection O
, O
and O
the O
burial O
of O
every O
promising O
expectation O
, O
if O
, O
when O
thus O
blighted O
and O
withered O
upon O
earth O
, O
they O
became O
rooted O
and O
strengthened O
for O
eternity O
. O
" O
What O
empty O
shadows O

" O
Martin S-PERSON
had O
brought O
in O
the O
tea-tray O
, O
and O
Marion S-PERSON
scarcely O
noticed O
his O
entrance O
or O
departure O
while O
mournfully O
gazing O
on O
the O
dim O
embers O
expiring O
in O
the O
grate O
, O
when O
her O
attention O
became O
suddenly O
attracted O
by O
hearing O
a O
carriage O
draw O
up O
close O
to O
the O
door O
, O
and O
her O
pale O
cheek O
grew O
paler O
, O
when O
a O
moment O
afterwards O
her O
sister O
hurried O
into O
the O
room O
, O
and O
with O
a O
strange O
, O
wild O
, O
hysterical O
smile O
, O
clasped O
her O
arms O
around O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
and O
locked O
her O
in O
a O
long O
embrace O
. O
Marion S-PERSON
thought O
no O
grief O
too O
great O
for O
the O
loss O
they O
had O
both O
sustained O
, O
and O
yet O
she O
became O
startled O
to O
perceive O
that O
Agnes S-PERSON
was O
actually O
shivering O
with O
agitation O
| | O
that O
her O
eyes O
were O
blood O
- O
shot O
, O
her O
hair O
dishevelled O
, O
her O
whole O
form O
shrunk O
and O
altered O
, O
while O
her O
lips O
quivered O
for O
a O
moment O
as O
if O
she O
would O
have O
spoken O
but O
could O
not O
articulate O

and O
a O
look O
of O
unutterable O
anguish O
swept O
across O
her O
pallid O
countenance O
. O
At O
length O
, O
burying O
her O
face O
on O
Marion's S-PERSON
shoulder O
, O
she O
exclaimed O
, O
in O
a O
voice O
of O
thrilling O
agony O
, O
" O

replied O
Marion S-PERSON

alarmed O
and O
shocked O
at O
the O
unexpected O
excess O
of O

grief O

Marion S-PERSON
gasped O
for O
breath O
, O

tried O
to O
suppress O
her O
emotion O

that O

might O
compose O
the O
mind O
of O

voice O
had O
become O
hollow O
, O
her O
eyes O
were O
brightened O
by O
fever O

there O
was O
a O
frantic O
energy O
in O
her O
tone O

manner O
so O
tearfully O
agitating O

that O
Marion S-PERSON
entreated O
her O
to O
postpone O
all O
farther O
discussion O

she O
was O
better O
able O
to O
bear O
it O

Agnes S-PERSON

to O
pour O
forth O

, O
after O

time O

Spare O
me O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
the O
recapitulation O
of O
all O
that O
passed O
: O
it O
is O
too O
humbling O
, O
too O
dreadful O
. O
She O
told O
me O
that O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
, O
the O
only O
man O
I O
ever O
loved O

had O
spoken O
of O
me O
to O
his O
uncle O
— O
as O
— O
as O
I O
deserved O
, O
with O
scorn O
, O
derision O
, O
and O
censure O
! O
She O
repeated O
the O
whole O
scene O
, O
and O
I O
then O
saw O
myself O
as O
I O
am O
in O
the O
sight O
of O
others O
— O
seared O
in O
heart O
, O
degraded O
, O
contemptible O
, O
wretched O
! O
and O
oh O
! O
how O
ungrateful O
to O
those O
who O
were O
, O
indeed O
, O
my O
friends O
! O
" O
Marion S-PERSON
saw O
that O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
when O
she O
spoke O
, O
gazed O
at O
the O
portrait O
of O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
| | O
and O
tears O
sprang O
into O
the O
eyes O
of O
both O
, O
as O
they O
looked O
upon O
that O
silent O
memorial O
of O
past O
worth O
and O
affection O
. O
" O
My O
reputation O
must O
be O
irreparably O
injured O
in O
the O
world's O
eye O
by O
such O
association O
! O
" O
continued O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
rapidly O
. O
" O
All O
is O
agony O
and O
horror O
! O
While O
Dixon S-PERSON
yet O
spoke O
, O
I O
hated O
myself O
and O
everything O
around O
. O
Shame O
and O
mortification O
overpowered O
me O
! O
All O
became O
shadowy O
, O
confused O
, O
and O
wavering O
in O
my O
thoughts O
. O
That O
night O
I O
was O
seized O
with O
fever O
and O
delirium O
. O
A O
sick O
- O
nurse O
was O
placed O
to O
attend O
on O
me O
| | O
and O
I O
am O
thankful O
to O
find O
that O
Mrs. O
O'Donoghoe S-PERSON
, O
with O
her O
party O
, O
instantly O
left O
the O
house O
. O
I O
am O
ashamed O
to O
think O
what O
folly O
my O
ravings O
must O
have O
disclosed O
! O
The O
worst O
horror O
of O
fever O
is O
, O
that O
it O
betrays O
all O
to O
others O
! O
I O
hovered O
on O
the O
very O
brink O
of O
the O
grave O
! O
Oh O
! O
that O
I O
had O
been O
as O
fully O
prepared O
to O
enter O
another O
world O
as O
I O
was O
to O
leave O
this O
! O
How O
happy O
are O
those O
whose O
trials O
and O
mortifications O
are O
buried O
in O
the O
silent O
grave O
, O
and O
whose O
pulse O
is O
no O
longer O
like O
mine O
— O
the O
knell O
of O
a O
living O
death O
! O
Life O
is O
, O
indeed O
, O
an O
awful O
gift O
, O
with O
its O
deceitful O
hopes O
and O
consuming O
sorrows O
! O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
if O
we O
will O
not O
be O
satisfied O
with O
the O
happiness O
provided O
for O
us O
by O
God O
himself O

will O
persist O
in O
laying O
out O
a O
plan O
of O
life O

in O
being O
wretched O
when O
the O
infinite O
wisdom O

fit O

How O
much O
better O
it O
is O
, O
to O
lose O
all O
your O

, O
whatever O
is O

more O

forward O

those O
regions O

eternal O
joy O

our O
sorrows O
here O
are O
all O
sent O
on O
purpose O

Dear O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
for O
my O
sake O
you O
must O
not O
despond O
. O
" O
" O
I O
ought O
not O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
while O
you O
are O
my O
sister O
! O
I O
hate O
the O
world O

every O
thing O
in O
it O
, O
but O
who O
would O
not O
love O
you O
, O
" O
replied O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
voice O
of O
dark O
and O
stormy O
grief O
, O
while O
no O
tear O
was O
on O
her O
cheek O
. O
" O
My O
heart O
seems O
dry O
as O
summer O
dust O
! O
My O
body O
is O
a O
dreary O
sepulchre O
to O
my O
mind O
, O
all O
dark O
, O
cold O
, O
and O
desolate O
. O
There O
is O
nothing O
in O
life O
worth O
living O
for O
! O
" O
Though O
little O
of O
Agnes' O
depression O
was O
really O
caused O
by O
Sir O
Arthur's S-PERSON
death O
, O
yet O
her O
grief O
became O
now O
as O
deep O
as O
crape O
and O
bombazine O
could O
make O
it O
. O
She O
had O
not O
the O
generosity O
to O
struggle O
against O
her O
mortified O
feelings O
, O
or O
to O
spare O
those O
of O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
but O
from O
day O
to O
day O
her O
wayward O
mind O
seemed O
to O
cherish O
the O
chagrin O
which O
inch O
by O
inch O
consumed O
her O
. O
No O
gentle O
self O
- O
renunciation O
appeared O
in O
her O
sorrow O
, O
but O
she O
seemed O
to O
fancy O
that O
in O
all O
the O
world O
there O
was O
no O
tear O
except O
of O
her O
shedding O
, O
— O
no O
sigh O
but O
of O
her O
breathing O
, O
— O
and O
she O
forgot O
to O
observe O
how O
Marion S-PERSON
had O
banished O
all O
her O
own O
anxieties O
and O
cares O
while O
listening O
to O
the O
egotism O
of O
grief O
in O
another O
, O
thus O
bearing O
the O
whole O
burden O
of O
both O
. O
Agnes S-PERSON
gradually O
delivered O
herself O
up O
to O
a O
state O
of O
peevish O
, O
listless O
, O
apathetic O
despondency O
. O
If O
she O
attempted O
to O
read O
, O
her O
eyes O
looked O
only O
on O
a O
wilderness O
of O
words O
without O
meaning O
| | O
she O
had O
no O
taste O
for O
work O
, O
not O
a O
correspondent O
in O
the O
world O
, O
and O
never O
had O
cared O
for O
a O
newspaper O
| | O
therefore O
unable O
to O
fix O
her O
attention O
on O
any O
employment O
, O
she O
proceeded O
with O
sullen O
, O
mechanical O
indifference O
, O
through O
the O
ordinary O
routine O
of O
life O
, O
without O
energy O
and O
without O
interest O
. O
Agnes' S-PERSON
mind O
was O
like O
a O
crushed O
butterfly O
, O
disfigured O
and O
valueless O
| | O
all O
its O
buoyant O
hopes O
and O
fantastic O
flights O
for O
ever O
at O
an O
end O
. O
She O
knew O
not O
that O
sunshine O
of O
the O
heart O
, O
often O
divinely O
given O
amidst O
the O
darkest O
hours O
of O
life O
, O
when O
inward O
peace O
, O
amidst O
external O
sorrow O
, O
might O
be O
compared O
to O
a O
cheerful O
, O
quiet O
room O
, O
while O
a O
torrent O
and O
tempest O
are O
raging O
unheeded O
around O
. O
Agnes S-PERSON
mistakenly O
believed O
that O
the O
only O
possible O
aggravation O
to O
her O
melancholy O
would O
arise O
, O
if O
her O
thoughts O
were O
turned O
to O
religion O
, O
since O
hitherto O
she O
had O
seen O
in O
it O
nothing O
but O
the O
gloomy O
terrors O
of O
futurity O
. O
She O
never O
had O
cultivated O
any O
taste O
for O
reading O
that O
infallible O
balm O
to O
the O
depressed O
, O
and O
least O
of O
all O
would O
she O
have O
thought O
of O
appealing O
to O
the O
Holy O
Scriptures O
for O
relief O
from O
the O
cankering O
irritation O
of O
her O
proud O
but O
broken O
spirit O
, O
and O
nothing O
had O
ever O
annoyed O
her O
more O
, O
than O
when O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
one B-DATE
day E-DATE
, O
from O
the O
fulness O
of O
her O
own O
heart O
, O
observed O
with O
soothing O
gentleness O
, O
that O
they O
should O
be O
too O
grateful O
for O
the O
blessings O
bestowed O
, O
to O
repine O
for O
those O
which O
were O
withheld O
, O
especially O
as O
affliction O
was O
generally O
the O
surest O
way O
to O
amend O
the O
heart O
. O
" O
Yes O
! O
but O
in O
mending O
you O
may O
break O
it O
, O
" O
replied O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
discontentedly O
. O
" O
My O
existence O
here O
is O
a O
living O
death O
, O
with O
nothing O
to O
care O
for O
, O
nothing O
to O
hope O
for O

nothing O
to O
do O

meditating O
continually O
on O
my O
feelings O

yet O
dreading O
death O

replied O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
laying O
her O
hand O
on O
the O
Bible S-WORK_OF_ART

" O
here O
, O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
I O
find O
enough O
to O
care O
for O

enough O
to O
hope O
for O

more O
than O
enough O
to O
do O

No O
mortal O
being O
has O
all O
his O
wishes O
granted O

why O
should O
we O
expect O
to O
be O
an O
exception O
? O
The O
world O
and O
its O
affections O
have O
deprived O
us O
of O
peace O

this O
is O
the O
only O
guiding O

star O
which O
can O

" O
Marion S-PERSON
! O
I O
am O
surely O
melancholy O
enough O
already O

without O
becoming O
methodistical O

" O
interrupted O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
impatiently O
. O
" O
I O
wept O
when O
I O
was O
born O

every O

" O

, O
Agnes S-PERSON

of O
Lady B-PERSON
Towercliffe E-PERSON

would O
send O

ourselves O
lonely O

here O
is O
a O
bright O
path O

pointed O
out O

us O

peevishly O

" O
You O
are O
so O
fond O

in O
the O
words O
of O
a O

far O

it O

ceaseless O
irritability O

continually O
prophesying O
evil O

recollecting O

took O
the O
most O

attributed O

superficial O
feelings O
were O
calculated O
only O
to O
produce O
a O
mushroom O
crop O
of O
petty O
discontents O
and O
selfish O
grievances O
. O
Sharp O
and O
acute O
as O
the O
pang O
of O
her O
disappointed O
vanity O
had O
been O
, O
it O
seemed O
destined O
not O
to O
be O
very O
lasting O
, O
as O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
on O
returning O
one B-DATE
day E-DATE
from O
a O
long O
walk O
, O
almost O
smiled O
to O
find O
Lady B-PERSON
Towercliffe E-PERSON
seated O
in O
their O
small O
parlour O
, O
and O
diligently O
pouring O
a O
torrent O
of O
lively O
gossip O
into O
the O
ears O
of O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
who O
felt O
little O
disposed O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
to O
become O
interested O
in O
all O
the O
ill O
- O
assorted O
marriages O
people O
might O
choose O
to O
make O
, O
or O
to O
care O
who O
had O
died O
, O
or O
were O
likely O
to O
be O
born O
: O
but O
gradually O
her O
mind O
had O
been O
opened O
to O
the O
consideration O
of O
whether O
Miss O
Brown S-PERSON
were O
a O
suitable O
match O
for O
Mr. O
Grey S-PERSON
— O
whether O
£ O
500 S-MONEY
a O
year O
might O
possibly O
be O
enough O
to O
maintain O
Captain O
Jackson S-PERSON
of O
the O
10th S-ORDINAL
and O
Lady O
Maria B-PERSON
Meredith E-PERSON
, O
whose O
individual O
expenditure O
on O
dress O
amounted O
to O
£ O
400 S-MONEY
per O
annum O
each O
, O
and O
whether O
it O
would O
be O
best O
for O
Lieutenant B-PERSON
Stanley E-PERSON
and O
Miss O
Maynard S-PERSON
to O
marry O
and O
settle O
in O
Australia S-GPE
, O
or O
to O
continue O
single O
and O
remain O
at O
home O
. O
Agnes S-PERSON
had O
no O
possible O
chance O
of O
seeing O
the O
parties O
, O
or O
of O
influencing O
their O
decision O
. O
She O
would O
probably O
never O
hear O
more O
of O
them O
, O
nor O
had O
she O
been O
previously O
aware O
of O
their O
existence O
, O
yet O
the O
magic O
of O
Lady B-PERSON
Towercliffe's E-PERSON
eloquence O
gradually O
led O
her O
on O
to O
argue O
the O
merits O
of O
each O
case O
, O
as O
if O
she O
had O
been O
the O
arbiter O
of O
their O
fate O
, O
till O
at O
length O
, O
being O
insensibly O
roused O
from O
her O
stupor O
of O
melancholy O
indulgence O
, O
the O
visit O
was O
concluded O
by O
Agnes S-PERSON
joyfully O
consenting O
to O
dine O
at O
Lady B-PERSON
Towercliffe's E-PERSON
next B-DATE
day E-DATE
, O
to O
meet O
a O
party O
of O
friends O
. O
After O
having O
feared O
that O
her O
sister O
never O
would O
smile O
again O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
now O
, O
with O
glad O
surprise O
, O
heard O
Agnes S-PERSON
once O
more O
actually O
laugh O
, O
and O
she O
could O
not O
but O
wonder O
that O
Lady B-PERSON
Towercliffe E-PERSON
, O
by O
putting O
her O
through O
a O
course O
of O
gossip O
, O
and O
administering O
to O
a O
" O
mind O
diseased O
" O
a O
strong O
mixture O
of O
love O
affairs O
, O
quarrels O
, O
sicknesses O
, O
and O
bankruptcies O
, O
had O
acted O
on O
the O
spirits O
of O
Agnes S-PERSON
as O
a O
counter O
- O
irritation O
, O
so O
that O
, O
in O
the O
contemplation O
of O
other O
people's O
miseries O
, O
she O
attained O
a O
spurious O
resignation O
beneath O
her O
own O
. O
As O
sorrow O
is O
the O
rust O
of O
the O
soul O
, O
everything O
that O
traverses O
the O
surface O
, O
has O
a O
tendency O
to O
scour O
it O
away O
, O
and O
the O
scattered O
links O
of O
Agnes' O
happiness O
seemed O
brightening O
now O
again O
, O
as O
if O
they O
might O
at O
last O
be O
reunited O
into O
as O
glittering O
a O
chain O
as O
before O
, O
while O
her O
cheek O
resumed O
its O
wonted O
hue O
and O
her O
tongue O
its O
wonted O
volubility O
. O
After O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
great O
affliction O
of O
life O
, O
it O
is O
said O
that O
the O
sufferer O
never O
is O
again O
the O
same O
, O
" O
that O
the O
heart O
can O
know O
no O
second S-ORDINAL
spring O
| | O
" O
but O
now O
there O
seemed O
every O
probability O
that O
, O
though O
the O
drooping O
pinions O
of O
her O
ambition O
had O
been O
lowered O
, O
Agnes S-PERSON
might O
soon O
put O
a O
patch O
on O
her O
worn O
- O
out O
spirits O
, O
and O
be O
only O
too O
much O
restored O
to O
her O
former O
self O
. O
When O
the O
carriage O
next B-DATE
day E-DATE
arrived O
, O
which O
was O
to O
convey O
her O
to O
Lady B-PERSON
Towercliffe's E-PERSON
, O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
ever O
ready O
to O
enjoy O
any O
happiness O
reflected O
from O
the O
eyes O
of O
others O
, O
bid O
her O
good O
night O
with O
a O
sensation O
of O
real O
pleasure O
at O
this O
unexpected O
revival O
. O
There O
are O
strange O
coincidences O
in O
every O
day O
life O
, O
and O
the O
small O
dinner O
party O
at O
Lady B-WORK_OF_ART
Towercliffe's E-WORK_OF_ART
accidentally O
contained O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
last O
persons O
on O
earth O
who O
would O
have O
wished O
to O
meet O
. O
When O
Lord O
Towercliffe S-PERSON
received O
Agnes S-PERSON
with O
friendly O
cordiality O
at O
the O
door O
, O
he O
had O
not O
yet O
relinquished O
her O
hand O
before O
he O
suddenly O
felt O
his O
own O
grasped O
with O
a O
convulsive O
start O
, O
and O
when O
he O
hastily O
looked O
up O
, O
the O
countenance O
of O
his O
newly O
arrived O
guest O
had O
grown O
pale O
as O
that O
of O
a O
spectre O
, O
her O
eyes O
were O
closed O
, O
and O
he O
felt O
her O
hand O
become O
as O
cold O
and O
heavy O
as O
lead O
. O
Too O
well O
- O
bred O
to O
notice O
her O
strange O
emotion O
, O
which O
there O
was O
an O
evident O
effort O
to O
conceal O
, O
he O
naturally O
ascribed O
it O
to O
the O
remembrance O
of O
recent O
family O
affliction O
, O
when O
now O
, O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
, O
entering O
society O
again O
, O
and O
he O
silently O
led O
Agnes S-PERSON
to O
a O
seat O
beside O
Lady O
Charlotte B-PERSON
Malcolm E-PERSON
and O
Miss O
Howard B-PERSON
Smytheson E-PERSON
. O
Agnes S-PERSON
did O
not O
once O
look O
round O
the O
room O
, O
but O
she O
heard O
the O
low O
, O
deep O
tones O
of O
a O
voice O
with O
which O
she O
had O
too O
long O
been O
familiar O
, O
though O
now O
it O
must O
for O
ever O
be O
to O
her O
the O
voice O
of O
a O
stranger O
. O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
had O
been O
, O
some O
time O
previously O
, O
dividing O
his O
fascinations O
between O
the O
only O
two S-CARDINAL
young O
ladies O
in O
the O
room O
, O
and O
he O
continued O
still O
, O
with O
the O
same O
light O
laugh O
as O
before O
, O
to O
exhibit O
his O
rare O
gift O
of O
conversational O
humor O
and O
vivacity O
, O
after O
giving O
a O
slight O
bow O
to O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
which O
she O
did O
not O
even O
see O
. O
A O
mist O
was O
before O
her O
sight O
— O
a O
ringing O
in O
her O
ears O
— O
her O
very O
heart O
seemed O
benumbed O
— O
and O
her O
only O
desire O
being O
to O
avoid O
notice O
, O
while O
her O
parched O
lips O
refused O
to O
articulate O
, O
she O
silently O
fixed O
her O
large O
eyes O
on O
Lady B-PERSON
Caroline I-PERSON
Malcolm E-PERSON
, O
assuming O
an O
aspect O
of O
attention O
, O
and O
inwardly O
thankful O
that O
there O
was O
something O
in O
the O
room O
at O
which O
she O
could O
look O
, O
while O
circumstances O
had O
thus O
so O
painfully O
and O
so O
very O
unexpectedly O
" O
awoke O
the O
nerve O
where O
agony O
was O
born O
. O
" O
The O
world O

usually O
one S-CARDINAL
great O
" O

Scandal O
, O
" O
had O
not O
yet O
circulated O
the O
story O
of O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny's E-PERSON
inconstancy O
, O
and O
Agnes' S-PERSON
disappointment O
| | O
therefore O
, O
dreading O
above O
all O
things O
the O
contemptuous O
pity O
bestowed O
on O
a O
case O
like O
hers O
, O
she O
now O
exerted O
herself O
, O
from O
the O
fear O
of O
ridicule O
more O
than O
even O
of O
censure O
. O
The O
strongest O
emotions O
of O
existence O
are O
concealed O
in O
the O
great O
drama O
of O
life O
| | O
and O
though O
Agnes S-PERSON
felt O
herself O
grow O
blind O
when O
dinner O
was O
announced O
, O
yet O
she O
afterwards O
retained O
a O
confused O
recollection O
of O
having O
walked O
down O
stairs O
, O
leaning O
on O
the O
arm O
of O
an O
officer O
whom O
she O
had O
never O
seen O
before O
, O
discussing O
the O
hue O
of O
a O
ribbon O
, O
or O
the O
probability O
of O
a O
war O
, O
while O
her O
whole O
heart O
, O
mind O
, O
and O
spirit O
, O
were O
torn O
with O
contending O
emotions O
. O
Strange O
is O
the O
ignorance O
in O
which O
people O
may O
live O
respecting O
the O
real O
thoughts O
and O
feelings O
of O
those O
with O
whom O
they O
are O
at O
the O
moment O
in O
actual O
contact O
! O
Agnes S-PERSON
possessed O
an O
energy O
and O
pride O
of O
spirit O
which O
supported O
her O
now O
, O
while O
with O
flushed O
cheeks O
, O
and O
eyes O
brightened O
by O
agitation O
, O
her O
volubility O
became O
like O
a O
delirium O
. O
What O
she O
said O
to O
the O
stranger O
might O
be O
sense O
or O
nonsense O
, O
she O
neither O
cared O
nor O
knew O
, O
while O
her O
own O
laugh O
sounded O
unnatural O
in O
her O
ears O
| | O
but O
still O
her O
companion O
listened O
and O
smiled O
, O
looking O
even O
more O
admiration O
than O
he O
felt O
, O
and O
while O
Agnes S-PERSON
rattled O
on O
with O
apparent O
recklessness O
, O
he O
was O
inwardly O
conjecturing O
whether O
this O
could O
possibly O
be O
the O
beautiful O
Miss O
Dunbar S-PERSON
who O
had O
endeavord O
to O
" O
entrap O
" O
his O
brother O
officer O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
, O
artfully O
attempting O
what O
she O
had O
not O
been O
artful O
enough O
to O
achieve O
. O
When O
the O
endless O
dinner O
was O
ended O
at O
last O
, O
and O
the O
ladies O
rose O
to O
withdraw O
, O
Agnes S-PERSON
could O
willingly O
have O
fled O
from O
the O
house O
for O
solitude O
| | O
but O
Lady B-PERSON
Towercliffe E-PERSON
, O
to O
beguile O
the O
interval O
, O
importunately O
begged O
for O
music O
, O
and O
persecuted O
her O
to O
sing O
. O
It O
was O
weeks S-DATE
since O
Agnes S-PERSON
had O
attempted O
a O
note O
, O
but O
, O
anxious O
to O
avoid O
notice O
, O
she O
tried O
to O
remember O
the O
songs O
best O
known O
to O
her O
. O
Each O
as O
it O
rose O
to O
memory O
, O
seemed O
filled O
with O
remembrances O
in O
which O
she O
dared O
not O
indulge O
. O
Who O
but O
the O
unhappy O
can O
tell O
the O
power O
of O
music O
in O
recalling O
vanished O
years O
and O
vanished O
joys O
! O
One S-CARDINAL
song O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
had O
formerly O
accompanied O
, O
another O
he O
had O
admired O
, O
a O
third S-ORDINAL
he O
had O
copied O
out O
for O
her O
. O
All O
their O
sentiments O
of O
love O
and O
constancy O
he O
had O
with O
ready O
flattery O
applied O
to O
herself O
, O
and O
each O
had O
been O
played O
or O
sung O
only O
for O
him O

Hopes O
and O
feelings O
now O
for O
ever O
extinct O
, O
crowded O
into O
her O
memory O

a O
cold O
, O
curdling O
anguish O
gathered O
round O
her O
heart O

the O
notes O
died O
away O
inaudibly O
, O
and O
Agnes S-PERSON
at O
length O
, O
leaning O
her O
forehead O
on O
the O
music O
- O
desk O

burst O
into O
an O
irresistible O
flood O
of O
tears O

her O
eyes O
rested O
at O
these O
words O

The O

not O
destined O

evening O
subsequent O

after O
Agnes S-PERSON

retired O
in O
feverish O
dejection O
to O
spend O
some O
time O
in O
her O
own O
room O

Marion S-PERSON
was O
startled O
by O
a O
loud O
impatient O
peal O
at O
the O
bell O

and O
the O
next O
moment O
her O
hand O
was O
eagerly O
clasped O
in O
that O
of O
Henry B-PERSON

, O
whose O
countenance O
, O
in O
returning O
thus O
to O
his O
altered O
home O

was O
pale O
and O
haggard O
with O
strong O
emotion O

Marion S-PERSON
started O
up O
, O
giving O
an O
exclamation O
of O
sudden O
joy O
at O
his O
unexpected O
appearance O
, O
while O
a O
momentary O
smile O
flashed O
on O
her O
countenance O
, O
like O
a O
gleam O
of O
sunshine O
on O
the O
dark O
face O
of O
a O
wintry O
cloud O

but O
his O
eye O
sadly O
wandered O
towards O
the O
portrait O
of O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
long O
lingering O
look O
of O
deep O
affection O
, O
and O
, O
covering O
his O
face O
with O
his O
hands O

he O
threw O
himself O
on O
a O
sofa O
, O
remaining O
for O
some O
time O
buried O
in O
silence O

his O
whole O
frame O
shook O
with O
emotion O
, O
one S-CARDINAL
burst O
of O
grief O
following O
another O

It O
was O
long O
, O
very O
long O
before O
Henry S-PERSON
could O
listen O
to O
the O
mournful O
detail O
of O
all O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
had O
said O
and O
suffered O
in O
his O
short O
and O
fatal O
illness O

but O
the O
feelings O
of O
Marion S-PERSON
were O
soothed O
thus O
to O
meet O
at O
last O
with O
one O
who O
thought O

felt O
like O
herself O

Grief O
that O
disperses O
itself O
in O
words O

tears O
is O
speedily O
over O

but O
theirs O
was O
of O
that O
calm O
, O
concentrated O
nature O
which O
consumes O
the O
heart O
, O
though O
Marion S-PERSON
assured O
Henry S-PERSON
that O
nothing O
had O
yet O
done O
her O
so O
much O
good O

as O
this O
happy O

most O
unexpected O

that O

then O
advancing O

he O
received O
Agnes S-PERSON
with O
an O
expression O
of O
warm O
- O
hearted O
kindness O
, O
which O
brought O
the O
hectic O
color O
for O
a O
moment O
to O
her O
cheek O
. O
When O
Henry S-PERSON
glanced O
at O
the O
expression O
of O
settled O
melancholy O
on O
the O
beautiful O
features O
of O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
a O
gleam O
of O
indignant O
emotion O
flashed O
across O
his O
countenance O
, O
but O
it O
was O
succeeded O
by O
an O
effort O
to O
appear O
cheerful O

and O
by O
" O

" O
when O
he O
extended O
his O
hand O
, O
saying O
, O
with O
all O
the O
vivacity O
he O
could O
assume O
, O
" O
Here O
I O

CHAPTER O
XLV O
. O
After O
Henry S-PERSON
left O
the O
room O
, O
Agnes S-PERSON
, O
having O
inveighed O
with O
more O
than O
her O
usual O
bitterness O
against O
all O
persons O
, O
good O
or O
bad O
, O
and O
all O
events O
, O
past O
, O
present O
, O
or O
to O
come O
, O
retired O
to O
bed O
, O
leaving O
Marion S-PERSON
to O
muse O
with O
saddened O
feelings O
on O
the O
untoward O
turn O
which O
her O
sister's O
mind O
was O
likely O
to O
take O
for O
the O
future O
, O
which O
rendered O
her O
every O
day O
a O
more O
uncongenial O
companion O
, O
as O
now O
Agnes S-PERSON
had O
come O
to O
the O
final O
conclusion O
that O
she O
was O
herself O
the O
victim O
of O
unmerited O
and O
unmitigated O
misfortune O
. O
About B-TIME
ten I-TIME
o'clock E-TIME
, O
Marion S-PERSON
lighted O
her O
candle O
to O
retire O
, O
and O
was O
slowly O
leaving O
the O
room O
, O
when O
she O
became O
startled O
by O
suddenly O
hearing O
, O
immediately O
below O
her O
window O
, O
in O
the O
street O
, O
a O
noise O
of O
scuffling O
and O
shouting O
, O
mingled O
with O
vehement O
cries O
for O
help O
, O
and O
dreadful O
oaths O
, O
till O
at O
length O
a O
wild O
and O
horrid O
shriek O
arose O
, O
which O
thrilled O
to O
her O
very O
heart O
. O
Having O
hastily O
summoned O
Martin S-PERSON
, O
who O
hurried O
to O
the O
door O
, O
she O
paused O
some O
moments O
in O
an O
agony O
of O
alarm O
, O
and O
then O
rushing O
to O
the O
window O
, O
threw O
it O
open O
, O
and O
gazed O
out O
, O
being O
so O
close O
to O
the O
combatants O
that O
she O
could O
almost O
have O
touched O
them O
. O
Two S-CARDINAL
men O
were O
engaged O
, O
apparently O
, O
in O
desperate O
conflict O
, O
while O
Marion's S-PERSON
eyes O
became O
fixed O
on O
them O
with O
the O
fascination O
of O
fear O
. O
She O
could O
not O
scream O
— O
she O
could O
not O
move O
: O
she O
seemed O
to O
have O
lost O
all O
power O
of O
motion O
, O
while O
watching O
the O
whole O
scene O
with O
harrowing O
interest O
, O
yet O
with O
the O
vague O
indistinctness O
of O
a O
dream O
. O
It O
seemed O
as O
if O
some O
frightful O
night O
- O
mare O
were O
upon O
her O
, O
and O
as O
if O
she O
were O
chained O
to O
the O
spot O
, O
yet O
there O
was O
a O
frightful O
reality O
in O
all O
that O
followed O
. O
It O
was O
a O
fierce O
and O
deadly O
struggle O
, O
carried O
on O
with O
the O
energetic O
strength O
of O
despair O
. O
Again O
and O
again O
, O
in O
a O
hoarse O
, O
deep O
voice O
, O
the O
fearful O
cry O
arose O
on O
the O
night O
air O
, O
of O
" O
Murder O
! O
" O
mingled O
with O
agonizing O
cries O
for O
help O
. O
Marion S-PERSON
clung O
to O
the O
window O
for O
support O
, O
and O
shivered O
from O
head O
to O
foot O
| | O
while O
she O
still O
heard O
the O
loud O
trampling O
of O
feet O
, O
the O
fierce O
tones O
of O
defiance O
, O
threatening O
, O
groans O
of O
suppressed O
anguish O
, O
and O
then O
a O
loud O
, O
delirious O
shriek O
of O
agony O
, O
followed O
by O
a O
sharp O
, O
gasping O
cry O
, O
when O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
combatants O
fell O
suddenly O
to O
the O
ground O
, O
as O
if O
a O
hundred S-CARDINAL
daggers O
had O
pierced O
him O
. O
Windows O
were O
now O
thrown O
open O
on O
every O
side O
, O
the O
watchman's O
rattle O
became O
audible O
, O
there O
was O
a O
tread O
of O
many O
feet O
, O
the O
sound O
of O
many O
voices O
, O
and O
all O
seemed O
to O
promise O
speedy O
aid O
, O
when O
, O
amidst O
the O
death O
- O
like O
silence O
beside O
her O
window O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
heard O
a O
strange O
, O
unearthly O
laugh O
, O
which O
sounded O
more O
appalling O
in O
a O
such O
a O
scene O
than O
all O
she O
had O
yet O
beheld O
. O
A O
mysterious O
dread O
fell O
over O
her O
heart O
, O
her O
eyes O
swam O
, O
her O
brain O
reeled O
, O
a O
faint O
sickness O
came O
upon O
her O
, O
she O
made O
a O
feeble O
attempt O
to O
support O
herself O
against O
the O
window O
, O
and O
, O
with O
a O
convulsive O
sigh O
, O
sank O
almost O
insensible O
on O
a O
seat O
. O
When O
Marion S-PERSON
recovered O
, O
a O
low O
, O
murmuring O
sound O
of O
many O
voices O
became O
audible O
. O
Martin S-PERSON
hastily O
opened O
the O
door O
, O
and O
a O
crowd O
of O
strange O
faces O
appeared O
, O
pale O
and O
full O
of O
horror O
| | O
while O
several O
men O
almost O
staggered O
beneath O
the O
weight O
of O
a O
shutter O
, O
on O
which O
lay O
a O
motionless O
figure O
, O
partly O
concealed O
by O
a O
cloak O
, O
with O
a O
bloody O
napkin O
over O
the O
face O
| | O
while O
the O
stillness O
, O
the O
stiff O
and O
rigid O
look O
of O
that O
immovable O
form O
, O
could O
indicate O
nothing O
but O
death O
. O
There O
was O
that O
in O
the O
voices O
of O
those O
who O
entered O
which O
caused O
Marion's S-PERSON
nerves O
to O
creep O
with O
apprehension O
. O
A O
low O
murmur O
stole O
through O
the O
crowd O
, O
while O
, O
shivering O
with O
apprehension O
, O
she O
silently O
gazed O
on O
the O
stone O
- O
like O
, O
lifeless O
image O
before O
her O
. O
The O
hair O
was O
damp O
and O
matted O
with O
gore O
, O
the O
hands O
were O
clenched O
in O
agony O
, O
the O
dress O
soiled O
with O
clay O
and O
blood O
| | O
but O
the O
tall O
figure O
retained O
a O
look O
of O
solemn O
dignity O
| | O
and O
Marion S-PERSON
felt O
a O
cold O
thrill O
shoot O
through O
her O
heart O
, O
while O
her O
eyes O
became O
riveted O
on O
that O
ghastly O
object O
. O
Though O
unable O
to O
speak O
, O
or O
to O
ask O
a O
single O
question O
, O
her O
mind O
was O
intensely O
conscious O
of O
all O
that O
passed O
| | O
while O
many O
surmises O
were O
whispered O
around O
respecting O
the O
cause O
and O
origin O
of O
this O
fearful O
catastrophe O
, O
and O
much O
impatience O
was O
expressed O
for O
the O
proper O
authorities O
to O
arrive O
and O
take O
cognizance O
of O
the O
circumstances O
. O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
at O
length O
, O
feeling O
herself O
alone O
among O
so O
great O
a O
concourse O
of O
strangers O
, O
had O
slowly O
turned O
to O
leave O
the O
room O
, O
when O
her O
ear O
was O
caught O
by O
hearing O
the O
name O
of O
De B-PERSON
Lancey E-PERSON
, O
and O
, O
turning O
hastily O
round O
, O
she O
started O
to O
find O
Lord O
Wigton S-PERSON
close O
beside O
her O
, O
in O
earnest O
conference O
with O
an O
officer O
, O
who O
remarked O
, O
in O
low O
, O
ominous O
accents O
, O
" O
I O
am O
perfectly O
well O
aware O
that O
several O
discussions O
took O
place O
between O
them O
lately O
, O
respecting O
the O
circumstances O
of O
his O
childhood O
, O
though O
I O
understood O
them O
to O
be O
of O
a O
friendly O
nature O
| | O
but O
this O
very O
evening O
, O
at O
Mrs. O
Smytheson's S-PERSON
, O
some O
very O
high O
words O
, O
passed O
relating O
to O
a O
young O
lady O
. O
" O
A O
faint O
chill O
came O
over O
Marion S-PERSON
as O
she O
heard O
these O
words O
, O
and O
turning O
, O
with O
a O
bewildered O
look O
, O
to O
the O
speaker O
, O
she O
asked O
, O
in O
a O
low O
, O
deep O
voice O
, O
if O
he O
knew O
anything O
of O
Henry B-PERSON
De I-PERSON
Lancey E-PERSON
. O
" O
Yes O
! O
only O
too O
much O
, O
if O
all O
be O
as O
we O
suspect O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
stranger O
sternly O
. O
" O
I O
always O
liked O
De B-PERSON
Lancey E-PERSON
| | O
but O
if O
he O
had O
any O
hand O
in O
this O
business O
, O
great O
as O
the O
provocation O
may O
have O
been O
, O
he O
would O
be O
more O
like O
an O
Italian S-NORP
assassin O
than O
a O
British S-NORP
officer O
. O
He O
was O
heard O
once O
to O
declare O
the O
greatest O
abhorrence O
to O
duelling O
| | O
but O
these O
canting O
sort O
of O
speeches O
never O
come O
to O
any O
good O
. O
At O
Mrs. O
Smytheson's S-PERSON
, O
not O
two B-TIME
hours I-TIME
ago E-TIME
, O
he O
seemed O
very O
violently O
irritated O
against O
my O
unfortunate O
friend O
who O
lies O
murdered O
there O
. O
" O
Marion's S-PERSON
countenance O
became O
pale O
and O
terror O
- O
stricken O
| | O
she O
looked O
irresolutely O
round O
, O
and O
then O
, O
with O
faltering O
steps O
, O
approached O
a O
table O
on O
which O
the O
corpse O
had O
been O
laid O
. O
She O
could O
not O
speak O
, O
and O
her O
hand O
trembled O
convulsively O
| | O
but O
she O
grasped O
a O
napkin O
which O
shrouded O
the O
features O
of O
the O
deceased O
. O
Slowly O
and O
fearfully O
she O
raised O
it O
, O
gave O
one S-CARDINAL
shrinking O
glance O
, O
and O
, O
with O
a O
broken O
shriek O
of O
astonishment O
, O
beheld O
, O
stained O
with O
blood O
, O
and O
rigid O
as O
marble O
, O
the O
well O
- O
known O
features O
of O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
. O
Marion's S-PERSON
heart O
stood O
still O
, O
a O
cold O
shiver O
ran O
through O
her O
frame O
, O
and O
, O
tottering O
back O
, O
with O
a O
gasp O
of O
pallid O
horror O
, O
she O
sank O
upon O
a O
seat O
, O
where O
her O
blanched O
cheek O
and O
quivering O
lip O
revealed O
the O
agony O
of O
her O
amazement O
and O
horror O
. O
Conscious O
at O
once O
that O
this O
must O
be O
the O
work O
of O
Ernest B-PERSON
Anstruther E-PERSON
, O
still O
the O
world O
seemed O
to O
rock O
beneath O
her O
feet O
, O
with O
the O
vibration O
of O
crime O
and O
misery O

while O
, O
covering O
her O
face O
with O
her O
hands O

she O
tried O
to O
shut O
out O
the O
very O
thought O
of O
all O
she O

beheld O
. O
Martin S-PERSON
had O
sent O
an O
express O
instantly O
to O
Lord O
Doncaster S-PERSON

and O
, O
meanwhile O
, O
the O
dreadful O
tale O
flew O
far O
and O
wide O
| | O
while O
the O
universal O
appetite O
for O
horror O
seemed O
on O
this O
occasion O
more O
than O
satiated O
. O
A O
young O
, O
handsome O
, O
and O
talented O
officer O
, O
thus O
brought O
down O
, O
by O
some O
mysterious O
agency O
, O
to O
the O
dust O
of O
death O
! O
It O
was O
appalling O
| | O
and O
throughout O
the O
whole O
neighborhood O
, O
a O
spirit O
of O
eager O
, O
burning O
, O
impatient O
curiosity O
, O
became O
general O
. O
A O
summons O
at O
length O
arrived O
, O
for O
all O
present O
to O
proceed O
instantly O
to O
Kilmarnock B-ORG
Abbey E-ORG
, O
that O
depositions O
might O
be O
taken O
before O
Lord O
Doncaster S-PERSON
and O
the O
nearest O
magistrates O
, O
while O
Marion S-PERSON
as O
a O
witness O
was O
obliged O
immediately O
to O
appear O
there O
, O
that O
her O
testimony O
might O
assist O
with O
that O
of O
others O
in O
clearing O
up O
the O
tragical O
mystery O
. O
The O
unwarrantable O
suspicions O
which O
had O
been O
expressed O
respecting O
Henry S-PERSON
, O
formed O
a O
strong O
additional O
motive O
to O
Marion S-PERSON
for O
consenting O
to O
accompany O
the O
melancholy O
cavalcade O
, O
as O
she O
was O
anxious O
at O
once O
publicly O
to O
acquit O
him O
, O
knowing O
that O
, O
as O
the O
proverb O
says O
, O
" O
if O
a O
lie O
has O
no O
feet O
on O
which O
to O
stand O
, O
it O
has O
always O
wings O
with O
which O
to O
fly O
round O
the O
world O
. O
" O
Marion S-PERSON
hastened O
into O
a O
carriage O
which O
had O
been O
sent O
, O
that O
she O
might O
follow O
the O
body O
to O
Kilmarnock B-FAC
Abbey E-FAC
, O
where O
she O
was O
ushered O
before O
long O
within O
the O
house O
. O
It O
was O
a O
solemn O
scene O
! O
That O
large O
, O
old O
hall O
hung O
with O
antique O
armour O
, O
spears O
, O
horns O
, O
cross-bows O
, O
and O
portraits O
of O
many O
a O
long O
- O
forgotten O
ancestor O
. O
The O
gothic O
stained O
window O
, O
magnificent O
in O
its O
proportions O
, O
the O
ancient O
grained O
roof O
, O
the O
black O
oaken O
panels O
, O
the O
cumbrous O
, O
carved O
woodwork O
, O
the O
marble O
floor O
, O
and O
the O
faded O
tapestry O
, O
all O
dimly O
illuminated O
by O
the O
glimmering O
of O
a O
single O
lamp O
hastily O
lighted O
for O
the O
occasion O
. O
An O
uncertain O
, O
mysterious O
gleam O
was O
cast O
on O
the O
nearest O
objects O
, O
while O
the O
more O
distant O
recesses O
were O
thrown O
into O
gloomy O
shadow O
, O
and O
the O
tumultuous O
agitation O
of O
those O
around O
contrasted O
strangely O
with O
the O
locked O
and O
riveted O
limbs O
of O
that O
motionless O
figure O
to O
which O
all O
eyes O
were O
directed O
, O
the O
rigid O
stillness O
and O
stern O
composure O
of O
that O
countenance O
now O
invested O
with O
all O
the O
majesty O
of O
death O
, O
from O
which O
Marion S-PERSON
turned O
with O
shuddering O
sympathy O
and O
amazement O
, O
while O
the O
multitude O
of O
servants O
and O
spectators O
continued O
in O
a O
state O
of O
wild O
excitement O
, O
uttering O
on O
every O
side O
subdued O
exclamations O
of O
horror O
. O
At O
length O
Lord O
Doncaster S-PERSON
himself O
slowly O
entered O
, O
with O
several O
gentlemen O
, O
some O
of O
whom O
looked O
deeply O
concerned O
, O
while O
others O
were O
evidently O
no O
more O
affected O
than O
if O
they O
had O
come O
to O
see O
the O
fifth S-ORDINAL
act O
of O
a O
well O
- O
performed O
tragedy O
. O
Among O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
to O
appear O
was O
Henry B-PERSON
De I-PERSON
Lancey E-PERSON
, O
to O
whom O
Marion S-PERSON
had O
instantly O
sent O
an O
express O
, O
and O
, O
totally O
unconscious O
of O
exciting O
more O
than O
ordinary O
notice O
, O
he O
advanced O
to O
Lord B-PERSON
Doncaster E-PERSON
with O
an O
expression O
of O
heartfelt O
sorrow O
, O
wishing O
to O
volunteer O
his O
services O
in O
unraveling O
the O
appalling O
and O
mysterious O
events O
of O
the O
night O
. O
While O
some O
eyes O
were O
turned O
on O
Henry S-PERSON
with O
eager O
and O
intense O
scrutiny O
, O
an O
anxious O
investigation O
was O
commenced O
, O
though O
without O
success O
, O
for O
no O
clue O
could O
be O
obtained O
which O
threw O
any O
light O
upon O
this O
treacherous O
and O
unaccountable O
murder O
. O
Not O
a O
whisper O
was O
heard O
, O
while O
Henry S-PERSON
at O
once O
related O
all O
which O
had O
passed O
that O
night O
between O
himself O
and O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
, O
during O
the O
angry O
dialogue O
which O
had O
been O
overheard O
between O
them O
| | O
but O
as O
delicacy O
to O
Agnes S-PERSON
prevented O
him O
from O
being O
perfectly O
explicit O
respecting O
the O
cause O
of O
their O
dissension O
, O
several O
questions O
were O
asked O
, O
which O
he O
felt O
obliged O
to O
decline O
answering O
, O
though O
a O
cloud O
of O
suspicion O
gradually O
gathered O
over O
the O
countenances O
of O
several O
spectators O
, O
when O
he O
acknowledged O
having O
been O
in O
company O
with O
the O
deceased O
a B-TIME
very I-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes E-TIME
before O
the O
catastrophe O
, O
and O
that O
they O
had O
separated O
in O
anger O
. O
All O
that O
could O
be O
ascertained O
for O
certain O
was O
, O
that O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
had O
passed O
the O
evening O
at O
Mrs. O
Smytheson's S-PERSON
— O
that O
he O
seemed O
in O
unusual O
spirits O
, O
which O
is O
always O
remembered O
to O
have O
been O
the O
case O
with O
those O
who O
suffer O
some O
sudden O
calamity O
— O
that O
he O
had O
spoken O
of O
plans O
involving O
many O
years O
of O
life O
and O
health O
— O
that O
he O
had O
mentioned O
to O
Lord O
Wigton S-PERSON
differences O
having O
arisen O
lately O
between O
him O
and O
Henry B-PERSON
De I-PERSON
Lancey E-PERSON
— O
and O
that O
some O
one O
had O
been O
observed O
lurking O
near O
the O
door O
, O
when O
he O
took O
leave O
at O
night O
of O
his O
cousin O
, O
Miss O
Howard S-PERSON
, O
to O
whom O
he O
said O
in O
his O
usual O
tone O
of O
characteristic O
gallantry O
, O
" O
I O
shall O
count O
the O
minutes O
till O
we O
meet O
to O
- O
morrow O
. O
" O
Little O
did O
he O
then O
, O
in O
the O
bright O
glow O
of O
youth O
, O
health O
, O
and O
spirits O
, O
foresee O
what O
that O
to O
- O
morrow O
should O
produce O
! O
No O
farther O
information O
could O
be O
elicited O
except O
the O
evidence O
of O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
who O
described O
, O
in O
faltering O
accents O
, O
the O
deadly O
conflict O
she O
had O
witnessed O

but O
, O
being O
unable O
to O
see O
the O
assassin O
, O
she O
could O
afford O
no O
assistance O
in O
identifying O
him O

though O
she O
declared O
in O
the O
strongest O
terms O
, O
that O
in O
height O
and O
form O
he O
bore O
no O
resemblance O
to O
any O
one O

had O
ever O
seen O
before O

the O
madman O

Ernest B-PERSON

. O
To O
have O
explicitly O
denied O
that O
it O
was O
Henry S-PERSON
, O
would O
have O
seemed O
like O
a O
tacit O
acknowledgment O
that O
such O
a O
thing O
might O
have O
been O
conjectured O

and O
Marion S-PERSON
abhorred O
the O
very O
thought O
of O
his O
name O
being O
at O
all O
implicated O
in O
a O
catastrophe O
so O
revolting O
. O
Some O
time O
elapsed O
before O
it O
occurred O
to O
the O
imagination O
of O
Henry S-PERSON
, O
that O
the O
eye O
of O
suspicion O
could O
for O
a O
moment O
rest O
upon O
him O

and O
when O
the O
idea O
flashed O
into O
his O
mind O
, O
it O
seemed O
so O
perfectly O

as O
to O
be O
scarcely O
worth O

he O
now O
perceived O
with O
indignant O
astonishment O
, O
that O
there O
were O
those O
among O
the O
spectators O
who O
cast O
on O
him O
dark O
glances O
of O
doubt O

suspicion O

therefore O
feeling O
that O
to O
be O
accused O
, O
even O
in O
momentary O
thought O

of O
a O
deed O
from O
which O
his O
very O
soul O
would O
have O
shrunk O
, O
was O
intolerable O
, O
he O
advanced O
without O
a O
moment's O
hesitation O
towards O
the O
table O
before O
which O
Lord O
Doncaster S-PERSON
was O
seated O

and O
, O
placing O
his O
hand O
upon O
that O
of O
the O
corpse O
beside O
him O

he O
spoke O
in O
a O
firm O
and O
decided O
tone O
, O
though O
evidently O
with O
deep O
emotion O
, O
while O
the O
spectators O
crushed O
forward O
to O
hear O
him O
, O
and O
the O
dead O
silence O
around O
gave O
a O
solemn O
distinctness O
to O
his O
words O
, O
uttered O
, O
as O
they O
were O
, O
in O
a O
low O
, O
impressive O
tone O

I O
perceive O

with O
what O
degree O
of O
astonishment O

me O

" O
Henry S-PERSON
bent O
his O
head O
to O
Lord B-PERSON
Doncaster E-PERSON
with O
an O
air O
of O
resolute O
but O
melancholy O
composure O
, O
and O
stood O
back O
while O
several O
other O
persons O
gave O
their O
evidence O
, O
and O
Marion S-PERSON
observed O
with O
surprise O
, O
that O
, O
instead O
of O
being O
occupied O
in O
attending O
to O
their O
depositions O
, O
young O
De B-PERSON
Lancey E-PERSON
gazed O
with O
a O
look O
of O
wondering O
perplexity O
all O
around O
the O
large O
, O
old O
- O
fashioned O
hall O
, O
while O
, O
with O
an O
expression O
of O
absent O
astonishment O
, O
his O
eye O
wandered O
over O
the O
gigantic O
chimney O
- O
piece O
of O
quaint O
device O
, O
the O
rusty O
armour O

trophies O
of O
the O
chase O

the O
old O
historical O
furniture O

the O
tapestried O
chairs O
, O
the O
statues O
, O
and O
the O
richly O
sculptured O
ceiling O

At O
length O
he O
glanced O
towards O
Lord O
Doncaster S-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
been O
for O
some O
time O
keenly O
observing O
him O
, O
but O
whose O
looks O
were O
now O
hastily O
averted O
, O
while O
apparently O
occupied O
in O
arranging O
some O
papers O
, O
and O
it O
was O
evident O
that O
the O
aged O
peer's O
hand O
shook O
with O
agitation O
. O
Much O
might O
, O
of O
course O
, O
be O
attributed O
to O
the O
fearful O
event O
of O
the O
night O
, O
and O
yet O
Marion S-PERSON
felt O
that O
this O
emotion O
did O
not O
originate O
from O
the O
same O
cause O
, O
for O
the O
Marquis S-PERSON
cast O
frequently O
a O
furtive O
glance O
at O
Henry S-PERSON
, O
though O
avoiding O
observation O
, O
and O
his O
excitement O
obviously O
increased O
. O
Young B-PERSON
De I-PERSON
Lancey E-PERSON
seemed O
evidently O
struggling O
with O
some O
painful O
, O
agitating O
perplexity O
! O
Again O
he O
perused O
the O
room O
with O
a O
scrutinizing O
gaze O
, O
and O
again O
his O
eye O
became O
fastened O
on O
the O
aged O
features O
of O
Lord O
Doncaster S-PERSON
with O
a O
steady O
, O
earnest O
examination O

while O
still O
the O
expression O
of O
doubt O
and O
wonder O
on O
his O
countenance O
became O
more O
obvious O
, O
as O
if O
he O
were O
attempting O
to O
stir O
up O
some O
recollections O
which O
would O
not O
come O
at O
his O
bidding O
. O
Turning O
at O
length O
to O
Marion S-GPE
, O
he O
whispered O
in O
a O
low O
, O
almost O
dreaming O
tone O
, O
" O

in O
a O
tone O

" O
When O
Henry S-PERSON
, O
by O
a O
slow O
and O
difficult O
progress O
, O
had O
piloted O
Marion S-PERSON
through O
the O
dense O
mass O
of O
persons O
who O
filled O
the O
hall O

reached O
at O
length O
the O
spot O

had O
indicated O

where O
, O
lifting O
the O
tapestry O

he O
at O
once O
opened O
a O
door O

so O
nearly O
resembling O
the O
paneling O

scarcely O
to O
be O

they O
entered O
a O
small O
, O
low O
room O

seemed O
to O
Marion S-GPE
no O
larger O
than O
a O
four S-CARDINAL

post O

so O
dusty O

dark O

neglected O

looking O

had O
evidently O
not O
been O
occupied O

Long O
cobwebs O
hung O
like O
banners O
from O
the O
roof O
, O
— O
it O
was O
almost O
destitute O
of O
furniture O
— O

they O
found O
a O
picture O
placed O
on O
the O
floor O
, O
its O
face O
towards O
the O
wall O
, O
representing O
a O
lady O

young O

dazzlingly O
beautiful O
, O
and O
a O
boy O
beside O
her O
, O
playing O
with O
a O
large O
Newfoundland S-NORP
dog O

Henry S-PERSON
silently O
strode O
across O
the O
room O
, O
and O
, O
as O
if O
perfectly O
familiar O
with O
its O
arrangements O
, O
he O
threw O
open O
a O
small O
cupboard O
, O
into O
which O
had O
been O
thrown O
the O
broken O
fragments O
of O
several O
childish O
playthings O

He O
paused O
and O
gave O
an O
agitated O
look O
towards O
Marion S-PERSON
. O
His O
countenance O
had O
become O
pale O
, O
and O
wore O
the O
same O
expression O
as O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
, O
of O
almost O
agonizing O
perplexity O
, O
while O
he O
was O
evidently O
groping O
through O
the O
darkest O
recesses O
of O
his O
memory O
for O
that O
which O
still O
eluded O
his O
grasp O

Leaning O
his O
head O
on O
his O
hand O
, O
with O
eyes O
fixed O
on O
the O
portrait O
before O
him O
, O
Henry S-PERSON
remained O
long O
in O
this O
agitating O
reverie O
, O
his O
countenance O
flushed O
by O
the O
inward O
tumult O
, O
while O
hunting O
through O
his O
recollection O
for O
a O
more O
defined O
shadow O
of O
that O
which O
flickered O
in O
his O
brain O
, O
and O
Marion S-PERSON
silently O
observed O
him O
. O
She O
did O
not O
speak O
, O
she O
scarcely O
even O
breathed O
, O
for O
now O

seemed O
to O
her O
as O
if O
some O
mystery O
were O
there O
too O
deep O
for O
her O
to O
fathom O
, O
connected O
probably O
with O
Henry's S-PERSON
early O
history O
, O
and O
a O
secret O
hope O
glimmered O
on O
her O
mind O
that O
possibly O
the O
time O
had O
come O
at O
last O
when O
a O
clue O
might O
be O
obtained O
to O
the O
mystery O

birth O

The O
child O

whose O
portrait O

an O
obvious O
resemblance O

Henry B-PERSON

Lancey E-PERSON

as O
she O
first S-ORDINAL
remembered O
him O

The O
very O
dress O
was O
similar O

all O
around O
brought O
to O
mind O
what O
Henry S-PERSON
had O
once O
described O
of O
his O
early O
home O
. O
It O
seemed O
to O
Marion S-PERSON
as O
if O
this O
were O
the O
very O
crisis O
of O
his O
existence O
, O

she O
waited O
in O
silent O
hope O

expecting O
that O
the O
moment O
might O
come O
, O
when O
he O
would O
again O
speak O

tell O
her O
his O
thoughts O

but O
a O
deep O
oppression O
seemed O
gathering O
over O
his O
spirit O
, O
he O
riveted O
his O
hands O
over O
his O
face O
, O
as O
if O
anxious O
thus O
to O
shut O
out O
the O
world O
, O
and O
every O
thing O
in O
it O
, O
from O
his O
shrinking O
memory O
, O

there O
was O
a O
silence O
around O
like O
death O
itself O

XLVI O

While O
Henry S-PERSON
continued O
thus O
entranced O
with O
perplexity O

Marion's S-PERSON
attention O
was O
gradually O
attracted O
by O
a O
noise O

side O

, O
looking O
suddenly O
round O

she O
was O
startled O
to O
behold O
crouching O
in O
the O
remotest O
corner O
of O
the O
room O
, O
the O
figure O
of O
a O
human O
being O
, O
which O
filled O
her O
with O
horror O
and O
dismay O
, O
so O
haggard O
, O
so O
emaciated O
, O
so O
unlike O
anything O
she O
had O
ever O
looked O
upon O
before O
, O
that O
scarcely O
could O
she O
suppress O
a O
shriek O
of O
dismay O
. O
It O
was O
a O
face O
of O
woe O
and O
wretchedness O
, O
once O
seen O
never O
to O
be O
forgotten O

she O
had O
formerly O
seen O
it O

The O
sunken O
temples O
, O
the O
hollow O
eyes O
, O
the O
lurid O
glare O
of O
insanity O
in O
the O
eye O
, O
and O
the O
clusters O
of O
hair O
, O
black O
as O
death O
, O
blown O
by O
the O
night O
- O
wind O
in O
large O
damp O
masses O
on O
his O
forehead O
, O
all O
brought O
the O
wretched O
Howard S-PERSON
instantaneously O
to O
her O
mind O

and O
, O
grasping O
Henry's S-PERSON
arm O
, O
with O
an O
exclamation O
of O
terror O
, O
she O
attempted O
to O
hurry O
with O
him O
out O
of O
the O
room O
. O
Scarcely O
, O
however O
, O
had O
she O
made O
a O
step O
towards O
the O
door O
, O
when O
the O
madman O
darted O
forward O
, O
and O
closed O
it O
, O
then O
wheeling O
round O
, O
he O
said O
, O
in O
a O
low O
, O
husky O
voice O
, O
while O
his O
strength O
seemed O
so O
subdued O
, O
that O
the O
grasp O
of O
an O
infant O
might O
have O
mastered O
him O
, O
— O
" O

He O
paused O
for O
several B-TIME

and O
gradually O
his O
face O
assumed O
a O
look O
of O
ungovernable O
anguish O

he O
added O
, O
in O
a O
dreary O
, O
desolate O
tone O

any O

taught O
me O

speechless O
horror O

up O

iron O

as O
if O
the O
springs O

life O

drying O
up O

back O
the B-PERSON

a O
look O

told O
her O
only O
that O

She O
was O
too O
proud O

she O
did O
at O
last O
write O
a O
letter O

She O
there O
made O
a O
solemn O
appeal O

your O
justice O

compassion O

claiming O
for O
her O
son O
the O
affection O

the O
station O
to O
which O
he O
is O
entitled O

contrivance O

that O
her O

attention O

that O
Lord O

the O
varied O

had O
been O
too O
much O
for O

, O
at O
length O

a O
short O

severe O

recognised O
by O

world O

as O
not O

could O

forgiveness O

the O
prayers O
of O
young O
De B-PERSON
Lancey E-PERSON
, O
now O
Marquis S-PERSON
of O
Doncaster S-GPE
. O
The O
whole O
unfathomable O
abyss O
of O
Henry's S-PERSON
feelings O
and O
affections O
was O
now O
irradiated O
with O
hope O
, O
and O
he O
felt O
himself O
almost O
overwhelmed O
by O
the O
torrent O
of O
happiness O
about O
to O
pour O
upon O
him O
, O
when O
, O
hiding O
his O
face O
with O
his O
hands O
, O
tears O
of O
indescribable O
— O
of O
almost O
insufferable O
joy O
gushed O
from O
his O
eyes O
. O
The O
change O
seemed O
sudden O
as O
spring O
, O
bursting O
forth O
amidst O
the O
arid O
deserts O
of O
Siberia S-LOC
, O
after O
the O
snow O
has O
been O
melted O
away O
in O
the O
night O
, O
and O
the O
barren O
ground O
is O
, O
as O
by O
magic O
, O
clothed O
with O
blossoms O
, O
and O
warmed O
with O
sunshine O
. O
It O
appeared O
as O
if O
a O
word O
might O
yet O
break O
the O
charm O
— O
as O
if O
he O
might O
awaken O
and O
find O
the O
whole O
a O
dream O
of O
enchantment O
, O
but O
the O
crowning O
of O
all O
his O
earthly O
joy O
, O
was O
, O
when O
he O
at O
length O
claimed O
, O
in O
the O
open O
face O
of O
day O
, O
that O
true O
, O
constant O
, O
and O
disinterested O
affection O
of O
Caroline B-PERSON
Smythe E-PERSON
, O
which O
had O
so O
long O
been O
to O
him O
like O
a O
spring O
of O
water O
in O
the O
desert O
to O
a O
lonely O
traveller O
, O
cheering O
and O
refreshing O
his O
heart O
in O
the O
long O
pilgrimage O
of O
life O
. O
Oh O

doubly O
sweet O

who O

a O
brighter O

Caroline S-PERSON

while O
they O
looked O
far O
into O
the O
future O

anticipating O
together O
a O
long O
life O

" O

now O
to O
fancy O
nobody O

the O
world O
happy O

myself O

" O
exclaimed O
Henry S-PERSON
, O
gaily O
. O
" O
I O
am O
almost O
ashamed O
to O
be O
so O
much O
better O
off O

, O
as O
Lady B-PERSON

says O
, O
Caroline S-PERSON

I O
actually O

up O
the O

romance O

friendless O
adventurer O

Caroline S-PERSON

with O
a O
conscious O
laugh O

a O
slight O
relapse O
into O
her O
usual O
capricious O
vivacity O
, O
" O

asked O
Henry S-PERSON

smilingly O
watching O
the O
variations O
of O
Caroline's S-PERSON

XLVII O

Events O
come O
in O
clusters O

and O
the O
very O
same O
day O
on O
which O
Henry S-PERSON
was O
publicly O
recognised O
as O
Marquis S-PERSON
of O
Doncaster S-GPE
, O
Marion S-PERSON
received O
a O
letter O
from O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
, O
announcing O
his O
intention O
immediately O
to O
return O
home O
. O
He O
alluded O
, O
with O
a O
degree O
of O
feeling O
which O
surprised O
and O
deeply O
affected O
her O
, O
to O
the O
death O
of O
Sir O
Arthur S-PERSON
, O
and O
spoke O
of O
happy O
days O
yet O
to O
come O
, O
when O
he O
hoped O
she O
might O
, O
at O
length O
, O
be O
united O
to O
" O
the O
man O
whom O
, O
above O
all O
others O
on O
earth O
, O
he O
esteemed O
the O
most O
, O
and O
liked O
the O
best O
. O
" O
In O
reading O
these O
words O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
felt O
a O
pang O
of O
melancholy O
sympathy O
for O
her O
brother O
, O
believing O
, O
of O
course O
, O
that O
they O
alluded O
to O
his O
friend O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny E-PERSON
| | O
and O
deeply O
did O
she O
deplore O
the O
grief O
he O
was O
about O
to O
suffer O
, O
when O
first S-ORDINAL
he O
should O
hear O
of O
that O
appalling O
event O
which O
had O
filled O
every O
heart O
with O
grief O
and O
consternation O
. O
It O
was O
on O
a O
gloomy O
evening O
in O
the B-DATE
month I-DATE
of I-DATE
February E-DATE
, O
when O
the O
sun O
, O
having O
all O
day O
failed O
to O
disperse O
a O
thick O
fog O
, O
had O
sunk O
into O
darkness O
, O
that O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
expecting O
her O
brother's O
return O
, O
used O
all O
the O
little O
ingenuity O
of O
affection O
to O
render O
his O
reception O
cheerful O
. O
The O
fire O
blazed O
brightly O
| | O
the O
tea O
urn O
was O
on O
the O
table O
, O
and O
she O
herself O
had O
taken O
more O
than O
usual O
pains O
with O
her O
dress O
, O
besides O
having O
decked O
her O
face O
with O
unwonted O
smiles O
for O
the O
occasion O
. O
When O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
at O
last O
arrived O
, O
there O
was O
a O
tone O
of O
unusual O
kindness O
in O
his O
manner O
to O
both O
Agnes S-PERSON
and O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
who O
were O
surprised O
by O
the O
genuine O
warmth O
with O
which O
he O
expressed O
his O
happiness O
on O
seeing O
them O
again O
, O
and O
at O
the O
subdued O
melancholy O
in O
his O
voice O
. O
The O
fatal O
news O
of O
Captain O
De B-PERSON
Crespigny's E-PERSON
death O
had O
reached O
him O
on O
the O
road O
, O
and O
there O
appeared O
a O
profound O
solemnity O
in O
his O
manner O
when O
he O
alluded O
to O
it O
, O
more O
affecting O
than O
the O
loudest O
expressions O
of O
grief O
| | O
but O
it O
was O
a O
subject O
on O
which O
he O
seemed O
incapable O
of O
speaking O
| | O
while O
Marion S-PERSON
scarcely O
thought O
a O
human O
countenance O
could O
have O
expressed O
so O
much O
anguish O
. O
While O
Agnes S-PERSON
preserved O
an O
almost O
statue O
- O
like O
silence O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
took O
her O
brother's O
hand O
in O
her O
own O
, O
and O
endeavored O
, O
by O
every O
affectionate O
endearment O
, O
to O
testify O
her O
sympathy O
, O
till O
at O
length O
he O
clasped O
her O
in O
his O
arms O
, O
saying O
, O
in O
accents O
almost O
choked O
with O
agitation O
, O
" O
Your O
sisterly O
kindness O
, O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
has O
survived O
all O
my O
neglect O

misconduct O
. O
Let O
me O
thank O
you O
for O
that O

could O
it O
survive O
if O
I O
were O
to O
tell O
you O
of O
a O
cruel O

heartless O
treachery O

" O
It O
can O
survive O
anything O

everything O

whispered O
Marion S-PERSON
, O
earnestly O
. O
" O

nothing O
that O
distresses O
you O
, O
Patrick S-PERSON

think O
of O
it O
again O

" O

must O
not O
only O
think O

it O

ever O

Marion S-PERSON
, O
but O
show O
my O
regret O
by O
telling O
you O
all O

replied O
he O
, O
in O
a O
tone O
of O
deep O
, O
concentrated O
feeling O
. O
" O
But O
not O
now O
, O
Marion S-PERSON

not O
yet O
! O
I O
could O
not O
bear O
to O
do O
so O
in O
the O
full O
tide O
of O
our O
happiness O
at O
meeting O

" O
The O
color O
rushed O
over O
Marion's S-PERSON
countenance O
, O
and O
vanished O
as O
rapidly O
again O

but O
her O
eyes O
, O
which O
had O
been O
fixed O
on O
those O
of O
Sir O
Patrick S-PERSON
with O
sparkling O
affection O
, O
now O
fell O
sadly O
to O
the O
ground O
, O
while O
she O
made O
no O
reply O
, O
evidently O
trying O
to O
avoid O
her O
brother's O
notice O
, O
who O
seemed O
bent O
on O
reading O
her O
thoughts O

he O

gravely O
, O
" O

" O

Marion's S-PERSON

Marion S-PERSON

surprised O
at O
the O
lurking O
smile O

traced O
on O
her O

countenance O

I O
place O

indeed O

emotion O

the O
countenance O

Sir O

Scarcely O
had O
her O

left O

before O
Marion S-PERSON
heard O
a O
light O
, O
springing O
step O
on O
the O
stairs O

flung O

Marion S-PERSON

with O
almost O
incredulous O
astonishment O
, O
again O
beheld O

giving O
an O
exclamation O

rapturous O
delight O

could O
not O
for O
some O
moments O

there O
is O
a O
silent O
eloquence O
in O
deep O
emotion O

more O
powerful O
than O
language O

, O
giddy O
with O
excessive O
astonishment O

tears O

smiles O
seemed O
to O
struggle O
for O
the O
mastery O

summer O

mutual O

Richard B-PERSON
Granville E-PERSON
rapidly O
, O

almost O
incoherently O
, O
conveyed O
to O
Marion's S-PERSON
heart O
the O
surpassing O
felicity O

telling O
her O

each O

impatience O

having O
seized O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
instant O

hasten O

his O
happiness O

a O
deep O

Marion S-PERSON
listened O

her O
feelings O

she O
frankly O
received O
all O
his O
joyful O
protestations O

unchanged O

unchangeable O
attachment O

attempted O
not O

conceal O
her O
own O

saying O
, O
in O
low O
, O
tremulous O
accents O

as O
soon O

she O
could O
command O
her O
voice O
