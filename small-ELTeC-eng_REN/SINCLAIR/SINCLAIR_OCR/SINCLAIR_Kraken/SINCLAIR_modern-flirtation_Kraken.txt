UDER PROPTR.-`` Sir, the scene is set, and
everything ready to begin, if you please''
CnITIc.
IT was the rule of a celebrated eques-
trian, which might be adapted to authors
as well as to horsemen, that every one
should ride as if he expected to be
thrown, and drive as if he expected to be
upset. Impunity in publishing, far from
rendering an author presumptuous, should
tend rather to increase his timidity, the
danger being greater always of venturing
too much, than of hazarding too little;
and the more cause any writer has to
feel grateful for the lenient judgment of
an enlightened public, the more circum-
spect should he beeome, not to trespass

by an obtrusive reappearance on that
notiee which has already perhaps been,
as in respect to the author herself, be-
yond all expectation favourable.
An old provorb declares that ``a goosc-
quill is more powerful than a lion's claw,''
nnd authors have been called `` keepers
of the public conscience;'' but no influ-
cncc is perhaps so extensive as that exer-
cised by wvhat is termed  light reading,''
wvhich has now in a great measure super-
seded public places and theatrical enter-
tainments, affording a popular rcsource
wvith which the busiest men relax thei
hard-working minds, and the idlest oc-
cupy their idleness. It becomes a deep
responsibility, therefore, of which the
author trusts she has ever felt duly sensi-
hle, to claim the leisure hours of so
iany, while it is hcr first desire that

Novel-reading, formerly considered the
lowest resource of intellectual vacuity,
has been lately promoted to a new plaee
in the literary world, since men of the
brightest genius as well as of the highest
attainments in learning and philosophy,
allow their pens occasionally to wandoer
in the attraetive regions of fiction; there-
fore works of imagination, no longer
merely a clandestine amusement to fri.
volonus minds, are now avowedly rend
and enjoyed, to beguile an idle hour, or
to cheer a gloomy one, by men of science,
of wisdom, and of piety. Such is the
general eneouragement given now to
works of fany, that, as the literary exist-
ence of authors depends on attracting
readers, there will scarcecly be encourage-
ment cnough soon to induce historians

and biographers to dip the pen of vera-
city into the ink of retrospection, while
it is perhaps to be lamented that when
so large a proportion of the publie atten-
tion is oeeupied by novelists, their works
being certain of instant circulation, for a
very short period and for no more, few
authors afford themselves time to aspire
at the highest grade of imaginary com-
position. Whon such volumes are really
true to nature, they convey very impor-
tant truths in a form more popular than
a dry sententious volume of moral pre-
cepts, and perhaps history itself can
scarcely afford so graphic a portrait of
human life as many of those fictitious
volumes, written under the inspiration
of genius, which portray in vivid colour-
ing, the thoughts and motives by which
men are internally influenced.
The Life of Cleopatra, or the Memoirs
of Agrippina can afford scarceely so much
direetion to young ladies respecting their

views of life and manners in the present
day, as might be conveyed by a judici-
ously-drawn portrait of that world as it
is, on the stage of which they are about
to be pcrsonally introduced; and a large
proportion of those elaborate volumes
dignified with the name of history, can
only be considered in the main fictitious,
because, while biographers would confi-
dently state the private opinions, secret
intentions, and real characters of illustri-
ous men who lived and aeted several
hundred years ago, they cannot justly
estimate the actual dispositions and mo-
tives of their own most intimate friends,
nor confidently point out what circum-
stances have influenced the greatest
events in their own day. If two authors,
entertaining opposite political sentiments,
were to write the history of last year,
every fact recorded, and every individual
mentioned must inevitably be represent-
ed, or misrepresented, according to the

writer's own private feelings, while each
would believe he was writing unadulte-
rated truth.
Thus poetry and fiction, when true to
the principles of human life, exhibit the
mind and soul of man visibly to the
senscs; and history, which has been call-
ed ' the Newgate Calendar of Kings and
Emperors,'' supplies the facts of human
existencc, and may be considered a por-
trait of mcn's pcrsons and external
actions.
In writing a story of domestic life, it
is singular to reflect how commonly men
are remembered by their eccentricities,
and loved for their very faults, while the
most difficult task in fiction is, to de-
scribe amiable persons so as to rendor
them at all interesting and not utterly
insipid. Probably it may be for this
reason that modern writers too frequent-
ly, instcad of deseribing the principles

sentiments which embollish life, have
paintel in vivid eolouring, all that is low,
mean, and vicious in society, introducing
their readers into scenes, the reality of
which would be shunned with abhor-
rence, and flinging over vice such a
mantle of genius as converts the defor-
mities of society into subjects of interest,
-unfortunately even of sympathy.
Were authors obliged hereafter, to live
with the characters they create, how few
would desire to share with them in such
a worldl Even where the intention is to
represent an attracetive character, it sel-
dom appears as one which could be an
agreeable aequisition to any family cirele;
and in works of sentiment or feeling, no-
thing is less suecessfully pictured than a
generous and refined attachment, fitted
to survivo every trial or vicissitude of
existence, between those who are to love
and to trust each other for ever. Few

of mutual confidence or esteem; but such
narratives are generally founded on a
teazing succession of narrow-minded sus-

on the part of heroes and heroines, who
condemn each other unheard, and go
through volumes of heart-breaking alie-

rather than ask the most simple cxplana-

justification; but the weight of censure
might become greatly lightened by being
more equitably divided among all who
are entitled to carry a share, and in
these volumes an endeavour is made to
rectify the balance more justly, though
with what success remains to be diseo-
vered by the author herself, as not a
single friend ever sees her pages, or puts
on the spectacles of eriticism till after
they are printed. The only peculiarity
to which sho makes any pretension, in
once more presuming to publish, is, that
avoiding all caricature, all improbability,
and all personality, she has introduced a
few individuals aeting and thinking in

are carried on, too frequently fill up their

and long quotations, such as never are

too energetie a stroke given to the shut-

TuE two most dashing, bold, and mischievous
boys at Eton during their day, had formerly
been Sir Patriel Dunbar and Louis de Cres-

masters and pupils, by thoe strange and start-
ling invontion displayed in their exploits, as
well as by the ingenuity with which both got
safely out of every threatening predicament.

or at the bottom of every secret design, how
they could possibly have escaped being ex-
pelled as a frequent topie of subsequent
wonder among thleir contemporaries in the
classes; but their delight was to run as near
the wind as possible, and atill to display their
skilful pilotago by baffling justiee, and evading
the utmost rigour of the Iaw, while always
ready rather to do harm than to do nothing.
WVhen very young, the two enterprising
friends, both sinee gazetted into the 15th
Light Huzzars, had shewn an early predilection
for military life, by frequently cscaping to the
neighbouring barraeks, assisted by a ladder
of rope on whieh they descended every night
from the windows. A. gay joyous reception
invariably awaited these lively boys at the
mess-table, where they sung many a joial
song, and ceracked many n merry jest over
their claret, till, after some hours spent in
rapturous festivity, they stole silently baek
within bounds, and were re-admitted at the
window, by their respective fags, who had re-

these young eompanions were more like the

would best imitato the gradual progress of
becoming tipsy, though drinking nothing but
ecold water; in which exhibition they showed so
much talent for mimiery, taking off the sur-
rounding officeers boeforo tlheir faees, anl mak-
ing so many home-thrusts and personal re-

forgotten in the regimnent. On another occa-
sion Sir Patriek eaused himself to be placed
in a coffin, stolen from the undertakers, and
was carried through tho buarracks by his com-
panions, who made paper trumpets with which
they played the dead march in Saul, while all

guished themselves in a way not easily to be
forgotten, ausing their better diasciplined
companions to wonder, though in vory fcw in-

In the favourite aristoeratie achievoments
of driving stage coaches, breaking laps
wringing off knockers, assaulting watchmen,
with other fistic and pugilistic exploits, they
were nearly unrivalled; and occasionally theiz
genius had sonred into an extraordinary dis-
play of dexterity, in transposing the signs sus-
pended over shops, and in filching silk hand-
kerehiefs from the pockets of their friends,
merely as amateurs, but still the deed was
done, and the laugh raised litorally at the ex-
pense of the sufferer, as the plunder was re-
tained to be a future trophy of suecess. Each

completely exhaustod that he gavo them a
secret hint to withdraw, which they accord-
ingly lost no time in proparing to do, but not
till they had onjoyed a vory characteristic
revenge. When Mr Brownlow had takena

theatre, Sir Patriek suddenly discharged from
the gallory tho whole eontents of a prodigious
hbag of flour, whiech powdered all the heads,

well frolic, abstracted a stuffed bear from the
ncighbouring hai-dresser's, and having equip-
pel it in the costuno of Mr Bownlow, hung it
from the lamp-post, where a panic-struck erowd
was speedily assembled by the alarming report
that the reverend gentleman had ommitted

Sir Patriok argued his own cause with so
much skiIl and vivacity, while De Crespigny
looked so innoeently unconscious of the whole
affair, that, with a silent frown from the mas-
ter, of stern reproof and suspicion, they were,
not honourably aoequitted, but allowod to re-
turn homoe without any public murk of cen-
sure or disgrace; and soon after both joined
their regiment at Dublin.
De Crespigny and Sir Patrick had but one
companion whom they aeknowledged as their
equal at Eton, in all the spirit, enterprise, and
vivscity of their eharacters, but who was, in a
thousand other respeets, their superior, for

out how dangerous and dishonourable was the

it is like a kitten playing with a ball of
worstod, which is allowoed to come often ap-
parently within her gruasp, and is then, when
she least expects, twitched away farther than

by the Court of Session, against the two cou-
sins, Dunbar and De Crespigny, but being ap-
mpealed to the House of Lords, was recom-
mended for eonsideration, re-argued, re-eonsi-

inuiry, and new ases, followed each other in
ceaseless suocession, and many.of the lawyers
who were young men when the caso began,
grew grey in the service, while yet it remained
in suspenee. A grand-uncle of Sir Patriek's
had fifty years before bought an estate of
L.12,000 a-year from the Marquis of Doneas-

by which it was generally thought that the
land must be restored to the original owner,
he hastily and most unfairly sold the property
to the late Mr Granvillo for L.350,000, and
dying intestate, after having lost nearly the
whole sum in a mining speculation, it could
not be proved whethor Sir Patriek's fathor
had aeted as exeeutor for tho deccased or not,
so as to render himself responsible for his
debts, and liable to refund the sum paid by
Mr Granvillo. Thus, whether the entail held
good, and carried the estate baek to Lord
Doneaster, or whether it had becen legally
brokon, so as to ontitlo the Granville family
to kecp it, or whether, if it wcro refunded, the

lar rotation, to supply thoe vacaney which he
croated hiself; and a long train of minorities
in the family had caused the accumulation of
wealth and property to be enormous, when
the present proprietor sueceeded, fifty years
before our story commences. Nothing could
exceed his own astonishment at the unembar-
rassed magnifieonee of the fortune, of which
he most unexpeotedly found himself in pos-
session, as his father had been in the habit
of concealing the amount of his own ineome,
and allowing his heir rather less than nothing,
saying, that as he himself never had anything
to cut till he had no teeth to eat with, he was
resolved that his succeseor should be similarly
treated. In pursuanee of this plan, the old
nobleman even on his doath-bed, had actually
expired with a pratical joke on his lips. He
sent for his son, graely told him that with
ebts, mortgages, and settlements, tho very

morist, who in reality left him L.40,000 pecr an-
num clear, so great was Lord Doneasster's snr-
prise, that he declared his good fortune at the

advantage, on so large a scale, of his own
childless privilege, to sell the family estates,
that his two deceased sisters, Laly Charlotte
De Crespigny, and Lady Carolino Smytheson,
used seeretly to complain, that little would be
left for their children, if he persevered in
turning every aere into gold; yet no one over
could guess how the large sums were squan-
derod or melted away, which the old Marquis
was continually raising, unless they went,
as was strongly suspected, in the form of
`` seeret service money,'' among the priests by
whom he was surrounded.
Nobody had a better right to be eccentrie

ly youth into the slightcst approach towards

sister of Mr Howard Smytheson, to whose
care the young heiress had been consigned,
hoping that thus all the amputated limbs of

will were the same about this marriage, his
own will after death would be found very dif-
ferent from what his nephew probably antici-
pated and wished.

he had nothing to thinke of or to do,-bored in
short with the want of a want, Lord Doncas-

of mean ostentation and fretful pride, sternly
insulated in a state of solitary old-bachelon

which no ordinary mind could eonceive or
comprehend. Eneumbered with so many un-

wonder how he disposed of his superlluous

In the month of August, as regularly as time

ment, the only original eomposition he was ever
known to attempt, in which he prohibited
poachers and strangers from shooting on his
moors in Argyleshire, Mid-Lothian, Yorkshire,
Galloway, Cromarty, and Caithness, but oxcept

eneouraged by his public spirit,-and the mo-
uments daily arising in memory of departed

tribute of respeet and regret, for Lord Doncas-

It was an often-repeated axiom of Lord Don-
caster's, that every man cheats or is cheated;
but in one instance, and one only, his Lordship
had shown apparently some kind feeling, or

anger and gricf with which they listened to

At times, however, Lord Doneaster found it
convenient for his own private purposes to pa-
tronize the Anstruthers, nnd threatened, in the
hearing of all his young relatives, that if Louie
De Crespigny's conduet lid not in all respects
sntisfy him, an heir more subservient to his
wishes might be found, and though the culprit
must be his nephew, he need not be his sucees-

aroused hopes, wishes, and even expectations

then the game of life begins in earnest,''
WVithout education or prineiple, and with
no friend on the wide earth to confide in or to

to an appearanee of insanity, when, after be-

Mary, and give loose to all the angry torrent
of hie long-suppressed emotions. The sister's

temper vindictive, harsh, and deadly, his blood
nounted liko mereury in a thermometer at the
very thought of suecese, and often when he
spoke to his sister in the lowest whisper of
thcir future prospcets, she would start and
look hastily round as if in terror, lest the wild
dreamse of his undisciplined mind might be

ITs Iifo of Louis De Crespigy, from the
hour he entered thoe army, was one continued
steeple-chase after pleasure and amusement,
in whatever form they could be eourted, or at
whatever expense they could be onjoyed. At
a very early age, he was already a veteran in
the world and its ways; for he stood `` alone
in his glory,'' the most admired, eourted, and
idolized of mankind, a perfect adept in all the
arts of rendering himself agreeable in society,
and possessing many pleasant qualities, but
none that were valuable. During a gay career
of dissipation and frivolity, he had entered

with suecessive eagerness on a thousand flirta-

end, while his heart, like a phnix, was fre-
quently consumed, yet nover destroyed, and
alwvays ready at the sorviee of any young lady,
with youth, beauty, and aceomplishments
enough to excite his temporary interest. Being
of opinion, that, though not yet a peer, he
ought speedily to be one, young De Crespigny
openly avowed the impossibility of marrying
while Lord Doneaster survived, and joeularly
remarked, that it would be a pity prematurely
to out off the hopes of his hundred and ono
Scotch eousins, who lived, like Ernost An-
struther, on the hope, that if his necks were
broken at Melton, his sueeession might yet be
``cut up'' amongst them; and to the friendly
inquiries of his many relativoes, he frequently
replied with a condoling look, that he and his
unele were both ``' hopelessly well,'

ycars more particular thun ever.
One personage only seemed to lave the art
of doing no wrong in the estimation of Lord
Doncaster; and the respeet whieh he withheld
from all mankind, was eoneentrated to an im-
measurable degree on the Abbed Mordsunt,
who was the Cardinal Wolsey of IKilmarnoek
Abbey and Beaujolie Castle. Prond, over-
bearing, harsh, and arbitrary, he rulod over
the house, the purse, and even the will of his
patron, with despotic and unlimited sway. Men
are generally advaneed in yoears before the
passions and feelings have stampod their in-
delible traces, like the impression of na seal,
which becomes permanent only after the wax
has begun to ceool; but in every fenture of tha
Abbc's countenance, might now be seen the
evidenees of a gloomy, seere, and almost fero-
cious temper, yet never was there a greater
triumph of art over nature, than in the skill
with whiech he adapted his looks and conversa-

was his interest to govern, and the astonishing
facility with which he could oall up a bland
smile and insinuating voice, to supersede thc
habitual haughtinoess of his tone and manner.
Educated at St Omers, in all the dark su-
perstitions of thuat bigoted college, the Abb
was novertholess far from desiring to seek
within the walls of a cloister any proteetion
from those temptations to worldly indulgence,
which he had not even a wish to resist. He
neither preached nor practised the virtues of
his vocation, bnt paraded a whole troop of
vices openly in thc public eye; and far from
seeking to reform mankind, he never attempt-
cd even to reform limself. Though in perso-
nal appearance of distinguished ugliness, yet
sueh was the magie of his manner, that even
by ladies he was considered perfcctly irre-
sistible; and to all, whether old or young, he
generally succeeded in imparting a conviction,
that he saw in hecr, for the first time, a realiza-
tion of female perfeetion and female fascina-
tion. The Abbe was never known to stop

pleasure, , profit, or ambition, nor, whatever
might be the impodiments, was he ever seen
to fail of sueeess; for, like Bonaparte, he did
not know the meaning of the word '` impos-
sible''
After having reeklessly asguandered, in a
career of almost startling dissipation, the whole
of his own patrimony, it wuas believed that he
had obtained fraudulent possession of 10,000
belonging to his very beautiful niece, to whom
he must have refunded it had she lived to come
of age, or had she married it must hae been
restored to her ohildren, but about the time
our story commences, she was supposed either
to have died, or to have retired to a convent
abroad, though whethoer upon eonviction or
not, might be considered very doubtful, as she
had been edueated by her mother in the Pro-
testant faith, and it was generally conjeetured
that to so sudden and ontire a removal from
all former conneetions, her poverty moro than
her will must have consented. Laurs Mor-

sometimes conjectured that perhaps the evident
partiality and adiration of Lord Doncaster
might havo roused in her some ambitious
thoughts, baeked by the influonee of the Abbc.
Among the peeuliarities of tho Marquis he
had always professel a decidod contempt for
all respectable ladies, and therefore his atten-
tions to Laura MIordant were at best a very
questionable compliment, and bccame latterly
of a nature which few relatives wonld have

Toweroliffe deelared it was dangerous to a

The Admiral's honest indignation would
hasoe been voented in still stronger terms,

with elated triumph tho growing delusion of

there was a sturdy, resolute, old-fashioned

the kindest and most considerate attention to

Though the fre of Sir Arthur's eyes had
been quenched by approaching blindness, and
his weather-beaten countenancoe had been
secarred in battle, and hardened by facing
every tempest which had blown for half a
eentury, yaet his aspeet had an air of habitual
distinction and conseious dignity whioch eom-

gy in the expression of his feelings, and a
straight-forward pursuit of what he thought
right in all his aotions, which gave him a sin-
gular influenee over the affeetions and the
conduct of those with whom he wished to as
sociate, and the admirable use he made of
which no one aftcrwards ever had cause to
regret. His early lifo had boeon one full of
action and of vigorous exertion, seekcing, with

tempting to convince the sufferer, as most
people begin by doing, on such oceasions, that

to saerifice a day of his gay and busy life, to
a prosing tete-h-tete on the sea-beaeh with an

quished all hope of seeing his young friond,

slyly hoping that the gay Cornet wonld never

drowsiness, his rosy cheek dropped upon the

It was a fearful sight, that young mother,

that her last thought had been for him, as his

pursuing the actual murderer, he detained
Sarah during a moment, and dosired that a
glass of water might be brought for her, hop-
ing that the violent emotion she had betrayed
might lead her to a full confession. Laying
his hand then upon her arm, in tones of deep
and awful solemnity, he looked at her, and
pointed once more to the corpse, saying,--

termination, when, aftcr a silonee of several
minutes, during which hor very stillness was
irightful, supported by somo of the strangers
around, she walked with almost mechanieal
neonsciousness out of the room.
Again and again the house was searched
that day-the very floors and wainscots torn
up; but not a trace could be diseovered to
throw light upon the cause or cireumstaneee
of this disastrous event; and equally remark-
able was it, that no hint eould be obtainod of

ceived affeetions-of blighted hopes-of un-
pitied and solitary toars.''
Sir Arthur seated himself on a chair beside
the coueh for some moments in agitated ro-
flection, vainly endeavouring to colleet his
thoughts, and form thom into some tangible
remembrancee. " It is a strange und bewil-
dering sensation, to look at the muto features
of this death-like image, and to feel as if once
she had been kown to me in her days of
youth and bloom. A vague harassing per-
plcxity besets me in trying to realize the
floating and fliekering remembrances, which

before they can be identified. Where have
we met before? Suroly in some dream of for-
mer days I onee saw a smile of joy on those
pallid lips-I once beheld those fixed and
glassy eyes lighted up with intelligeneel but
my treacherous memory will not help me-it
realls enough to torture me with perplexity,
and not enough to be of any aetual avail.''
Sir Arthur wearied himself with intense
efforts to identify the lineamente bofore him,
but in vain. They. were lovely indeed., and
many a stranger came likewise to try whether
they eould be recognized, but without suceess.
The fearful story cireulated like wild-fire-the
excitement and curiosity it produeed beeame
intense; but not a gleam of light was thrown
upon the dark and mysterious event.
Among the many who hurried to behold
the murdered woman before her remains were
disturbed, two gentlemen arrived one evening
after dusk, and having ascertained that nei-
ther the Admiral nor any other stranger was
in the house, they gave Sir Arthur's servant,

muffled up, and evidently avoided any seru-

greatly agitated on lenving the room; and as
they hastened past Martin, and threw them-
selves into a hackney eonch which awaited
them at some distance, one of the party had
appeared so overeome, that he could not
walk without support. Much conjecture was
arousced by this incidont, which soomed to in-
oronse the mystery and interest attached to
the melancholy circumstances, and not a
loubt could boe entertained that these untime--
ly visitors had a moro than common connee-

truth and justice. Much as he had formerly
bemoaned the trouble entailed upon him by
deeeased friends, many of whom had bo-
queathed their estates and ehildren to his
guardianship, he felt on this oceasion, a pity
so intense, for tho namelese, friendless, and
helpless boy, thus unexpeetedly and tragically
thrown on his compassion, that he publicly
pledgod himself to harbour and proteot the
child in the mean time, trusting that some
connections might at last be found, to whom
he more naturally belonged.  Life has had a
mournful commencement for him, poor boy!
His days are dark, and his friends are few,''
said Sir Arthur, with a strong emotion of
pity, `` but we must hope the best hereafter,
and do the best that can be done in the mean
time, trusting that a wise Proyidenee, who
east him on my care and kindness, will also
wateh over his futuro welfare,''
On the night previous to that appointed by
Sir Arthur for committing to the grave the
last remains of the murdered lady, he who
had so often faced denth in every form, and

``lie'd the mouth of a cannon in battle,'' yet
felt himself awcd nnd dceply affeeted in con-
templating the solemn preparations for com-
mitting to the tomb one so young, so deeply
injured, and so apparently unlamented. It
wvas with mournful and mysterioms wonder
that he stood beside the corpsce, and contem-
plated that mortal frame, from which the
spirit had been so suddenly and so cruelly
lriven; and he could not but imagine the
scenes of love and joy which those eyes had
once probably looked upon-the busy thoughts
that had hurried through that lifeless heal-
the warm affections that had flowed through
that heart, now for ever at rest.
Wbile yet his mind was dwelling with pain-
fil interest on all the thoughts whieh orowded
through his faney, Martin hastily enterod the
room, and in an agitated voice requested Sir
Arthur's immediato presenee in the cntrance-
hall, as some persons were there who had or-
ders to communicate only with himself.
On arriving in the passage, Sir Arthur was
astonished, and almost astartled, to find scvo-

neither name nor direetion,'' said the man
who seemed to have charge of the business.

Sir Arthur hastily tore open the letter

He was astonished; and solemn as the octea-
sion was, almost amused to observe that his
name and direction had been carofully cut
out of the newspaper paragraph whieh he
quarroellod with somo weeks before at the
Club, and that this unknow eorrespondent,
to prevent the possibility of his writing being
doteeted by those who cxamined tho outside,
had pasted theso printed letters on the cover,

paceket was sealed with a plain impression on
blaek wax; the paper bore a broad blaol
border; and there was an evideut tremulous-
ness in the pen which had inseribed thcse

doned his house; nevertheless her child may

whole expenses of his education shall be libe-
rally defrayed, till he is grown up and has

It was a strange, cold, heartless commnnni-
cation from a parent, without one expression
of relenting affleotion, one word of solicitude
for his happiness, or one expression of grati-
tude to Sir Arthur for taking upon himself so
arduous a charge; but ntill it was to a cer-
tain extecnt most satisfaetory, the Admiral
being relieved of a great perplexity, by has-
ing thus ascertained in what rankc of life the

justified now in obtaining for him the highest

TE day of trial at length arrived, and the
conrt, from the roof to the floor, seemed one
sea of faees, erowded together like the
`` studies of hends'' on a painter's canass.
During the legal inestigation, whieh was
condueted with deep solemnity and anxious
perseverance, the mystery heecame still deep-
er, and more inserutable. No appearance of

ed and dissoloured, as if, immediately after
her decease, it had beon violently torn off;
and a vain attempt had evidently been madc
to snatch away a gold chain hung round
her ncek, to whieh was appended a small bro-
ken miniature frame, set with brilliants, and
adorned with what seemed to represent a
very antique coronet. The portrait which it
onco enelosed, had been, with obvious diffieul-
ty, removed, as tho marks were visible all
round, of some sharp-pointed instrument hav-
ing heen inserted in the frame, to which there
still adherod several broken fragments of
glass.
Sarah Davenport, who had been fully com-
mitted for trial, on suspicion of being an ac-
complice, refused to give any references as to
haracter, and was strongly suspected of ha-
bitually coneealing her real name, and of more
than once assuming those that were fietitious,
as her clothes and linen appeared to be mark-
ed with various initials, but in not one ease
did they bear those thiat sho pretended were
her own. It was evident that she laboured

under a powerful, but forcibly-subdued excite-
ment; yet, with a tone and manner externally
cold and hard as Siberian icc, she persisted in
professing her own perfect innoeenee, and her
utter unconsciouasness of anything that might
by possibility lead to a diseovery of the per-
petrators. She eoldly, and almost calmly,
threw baok glanee for glance, on the speeta-
tors nearest her, who were koenly watehing
every turn of her countenanee, while dark
surmises, and fearful oonjeetures, were whis-
pered in murmurs of horror on overy side:
but at length hor oye wandered to a distant
part of the court, when suddenly a livid pale-
ness. flashed upon her face-an indesoribable
but startling lustro glittered in her eyes-hen
whole frame shook, as in the ooldest blast of
winter, and with a suppressed groan of agony
and foar, she bowed her hend upon her hands,
and sunk fainting upon the floor. At the
same time, a man was observed hastily to
leave the court, and, gliding with rapid steps
through the narrow passages, disappeared

sence of mind to stop him, or could even iden-
tify his appearanee.
Nothing apparently touched the feelings of
Sarah Davenport, except when a suspicion
seemed to be implied that she wished to in-
jure the hoy: and when a question to thie
effect was put to her by the court, she wrung
her hands, and burst into tears, saying, in ac-
cents of piercing anguish, though with a shud-
ler, as if death itself were upon her, ` No.

An impulse of mournful intorest and as-
tonishment ran through the assembled multi-
tude, when they beheld the rare and singula
beauty of the child, after he was led into

swer some of the questions which were skil-
fully put, to draw out his reecolleetions of past
times, and especiully tho dark history of the
last few weeks. He was at first shy and in-
timidated, but gradually regained an unex-
pected degree of self-possession, and spoke
with surprising intelligence and distinetness
of all he remembered.
The boy retained a faint reeollection of
having been awakened, on the night of the
murder, by some violent scene of strife and
horror; but his faculties had evidently been
so beumbed by opiates, that no distinet im-
prcssion remained; and to his own young
ind, the whole seemed like a fearful dream,
too drenadful to look baek upon even yet, ex-
cept with bewildering terror. He gave a
clear account, however, of the last evening
he had passed with his mother, of whom he
spoke in aecents of infantine affection, evi-
dently unable yet to coneeive that he should
see her face no more.
An old gentleman, he said, had core into
the room, and spoken angrily to her; while,
110 MIODIERN FLIRTATIONB.
with astonishing precision, the boy acted over
the whole scene, recapitulated some of the
language they had used, and described how
his mother had clung to him with frantic
eagernese, saying she would promise any-
thing, if she might only retain her child;
how the stranger, who was vory tall, and
wore a black coat, had spoken again with
angry vehemenee before he loft the room;
und how his mother, whecn alone, had prayed
nd wept over him with looks of agonizod
and desolato giof, nntil he had beon carried
away to bed by the maid, who administered
some melicine to him, which she said the
doctor had ordered.
Ho spoke much also of a large old room
hung with pictures, in which his carliest
lays had been pussed, and of a small dark
apartment close beside it, into which he
had ofton been precipitately hurriod, appa-
rently for coneealment, and whero toys and
swectmeats had been always provided to kee
him quiet, while he was punished with the
utmost severity, for maksing the slightest

noise; and he still remembered with looks
of apprehension, the gentleman dressed in
blaok, who most frequently visited him there,
and often caused his mother to weep bit-
terly.
Sarah Davenport was then reoalled, and
rigidly cross-examined, respecting the gentle-
man who had visited at the house; but she
doggedly asserted her entire ignoranee re-
speeting his rank in life, or conneetions, and
pertinaciously maintained that the Iady'
death had been her own voluntary aet, and
that the asleeping potion had been given to
the boy by his mother's own imperative or-
ders, as she did not herself know even what
it eontained.
During a long and anxious consultation of
the jury, there was a hushed and intense si-
lence in the crowded conrt, so still and un-
broken, that tho breathing of an infant would
have been audible, while every eye perused
the countenanee of the prisoner, with an in-
tensity that brought a hectic flush, burning
like fire, upon her cheek, and she gazed
112 MODEN FLIATATION.
around with a glanee of anger that caused
her beauty for the moment to look like that
of a fiend or a fury.
At length, after arduously scrutinising every
atom of evidence that oould be gathered, the
jury, though morally certain of the prisoner's
being an aceomplice in the crime, felt unwill-
ingly obliged to bring in a verdiet of`' not
proven,'' and she was immediately libcrated.
after which, amidst the yells, jeers, and exe-
crations of the populace, who were convinced
of her ecriminality, she hurried from the court
and was seen no Iore.

and many erowded at first, with a tempo-
rary enthusiasm, to sce the bcautiful boy, so
strangely bereaved, and so cruelly abandon-
ed; but the interest and excitement of henr-
ing and relating his story were soon super-
seded by greater wonders and fresher news.
In a world where all are rushing on headlong

or small, aroe speedily hurried into one com-
non oblivion, people were tired at last of think-

ing or talking about young Henry and his
coneerns.
Every one of the Admiral's friends hinted
that he could have managed the whole affair
ten times better than Sir Arthur; all blam-
ed him for many things, and praised him
for very few; the Admiral was wondered at,
eriticised, discussed, admired, pitied, and cen-
sured, more than he remembered to havo been
for many yeare before; and the givers of ad-
vice were lavish of propositions and objee-
tions, all whiceh were bone by their venorable
friend with good-humourod indifferenee, whe-
ther adopted or not. At length several per-
feetly new murders from London eame on the
tapis in soeiety; those who liked roding in
the Jack Sheppard style were satiated with
studies from the life; tho Morning Post as-
sumed a terrifying interest; and the lady of
fashion who coneulted Sir Henry Halford
about her appetite, boeause she conld no

brealkfast, would havo thought, when they

it was a wearisome repetition to speculate an-
other hour upon a murder nearly a month old.
In short, `" the Portobello story'' ecased
to be told or listened to. Henry had had his
day. There is no such thing now as a nine
days' wonder, because nothing lasts so long.
Young De Laneey had been talkod of as muneh
as any reasonable boing could oxpect to he
talked of; and now it was univoersally voted a
bore whonever the suhject occurred in con
versation; for, as Lady Towereliffe remarked,
with a very long-drawn yaw, whon, for the
last time, it was alluded to in her presence,
 It was a shocking, barbarous, and really
startling affair; but all stories should he al-
lowed to die out like an echo, which grows
fainter and fainter at every repetition. One
cannot bo for ever talking of the same thing.''
When Henry De Lanoey lost one parent, he
cortainly gained another in Sir Arthur, who
often afterwards remarkzed, that in no instanee
sould virtue be more obviously its own re-
ward, than in the case of any kindness he had
shown to this fascinating boy, whose gay joy-

derie new life from watching the froliosome

raeter, however, and natural integrity of mind,
which Sir Arthur was delighted from the first
to remark, yet, when the merry group of
young friends assembled together on the
shore at Portobello, building houses of sand,
or running eagerly in search of shells, it would
have been difficult to say which was the most
arelessly lappy, whiloe the Admiral seemed
to borrow their young spirits for the timc,
and gazed with eeaseless dolight on those
joyous countenanees, radiant with laughter
and smiles, which were archly turncd towards
their aged playmate, sometimes with a chal-
lenge to run after them, or lighted up with
smiles of affeetion when they brought him a
bouquet of his favourite flowers, torn roughdy
from the stems, and crushed and erumpled in
their little hands.
Sir Arthur often seemed almost nshamed
to betray the engrossing interest and delight
he felt in his young companion, who gained
every day a stronger hold upon his naffoctions,
and it appeared as if he were anxious to for-
get that a time had ever existed when the

playful and interesting boy was unknown to
his heart; but a ciroumstaneo ocourred, not
long after Henry's adoption, which brought
painfully to mind, with greatly inereased soli-
citude, tho fearful mytery that hung over his
origin, proving also that danger still threaten-
ed him from somo unforeeeen quarter.
Wile the whole party of his young guests
were noisily engegel on the shore in a game
at hide-and-seek, one day in the month of
July, Sir Arthur had seated himself on a
beneh within sight of them, sometimes watch-
ing their gambols with pleasure, and frequent-
ly conning over a newspaper, which proved by
undeniable and satisfaetory demonstration,
that the country wuas entirely ruined-that
the Government was coming to an end-that
the Houses of Lords and Commons would be
completely demolished-that the ministry had
not another day to exist-and, as a grand
climax, that anarchy, confusion, bankruptey.
and revolution, were about finally to drop
their extinguisher over Great Britain. Sir

they could not possibly find him; but he was
too much pre-oceupied to give the subject
much attention, till at length Martin an-
nouneed that the children's dinner had waited
some time, and that still the boy was not to
be found, though his companions had been
searehing for him at least half an hour.
Upon hearing this, Sir Arthur hastily
started up, making a considerable expendi-
ture of energetic and wondrous exelamations,
while he gazed around with inereasing sur-
prise at the wide waste of sand, like an Ara-
bian desert, with whieh he was on every side
enceompassed, and where it seemed to him ae
if a mouse eould not be long conceealed.

A hasty and most anxious seareh was in-
stantly commenced in the garden, while Sir
Arthur and Martin shouted thoe name of
Henry at the full piteh of their voiees, but in
vain; not a sound was heard in reply, nor
was there a spot unoxamined in which he
could by possibility be lurking.
The Admiral now beoame seriously alarmed
at so unaceountable a disappearance, especial-
ly when the child's gardening toolse, with whieh
he had been last observed, were found muti-
lated and broken, at a great distanee, on the
beaeh-one of his shoes had fallen off eloso to
the water-and his hat lay nearly buried in
the tide. Sir Arthur instantly sumumoned the
police to his aid, but the search continued
fruitless, till at length the dreadful oonjeeture
became more and more probable, that Henry
must have rashly ventured into the water,
and been washed away by the wavcs-in pur-
suance of which apprehension Sir Arthur
summoned more assistance, that the water
might inetantly be dragged.
120  IODEnN LIRTATIONS.
Martin, meantimc, no less active than his
master, had aceidentally met a stranger on
the beach, who mentioned, on hearing of his
alarm, that on the road to Leith, half an hour
before, he had observed a boy struggling and
sereaming in the arms of a female, dressed
like a nursery-maid, who complained loudly
that the child would not go home, when a
young man, rather strangely dressed, and of
very singular appearanco, had instantly offer-
od lis assistanco, and carried him forcibly on-
wards. This gentleman sail ho had stoppel
the woman to remonstrato with her on using
the boy so roughly, as a cap wus drawn over
his cyes, and ho seemned to suffor agonies of
terror, sobbing convulsively, and trembling in
every limb; but the man had answered in
reply, with a strong Irish accent, that he
would see the child safo to his friends, and let
no one do the poor boy `` a taste of harm.''
The stranger added indifferently, that it was
no affair of his, therefore he ceased to inter-
fero; but he thought both the man and th

would not trust either of them with his dog
for an hour, to use it kindly.
WVithont wasting time in returning to com-
municate what he had heard, Martin hurried
forward to Leith, where, with reokless speed
and untiring diligenee, ho throeaded all the
narrow strcets, and olbowed his way among
earts, carriages, parcels, and passengers, till
at length he reaehed the pier, to which he
had been so eagerly aiming his steps. At its

as not a moment more could be lost.
At this moment a ory, almost amounting
to a serenm of ehildish joy, beeame audible on
the deck-a young boy was seen vehemently
struggling in the arms of a female; and in an
instant, pursued by a man who vainly endea-
youred to overtake him, he rushed past the
steward, ran across the temporary bridge, and
clasped MIartin round the knees, exclaiming,

The boy put his hand, with an air of happy
confidence and security, into that of Manrtin,
who anatehed him. up in his arms, with a
thousand expressions of joyful surprise; but
a moment afterwards, when he, recolleeted
himseelf, his first impulse was to secure the
eulprits who had decoyed Henry away, and
to deliver them up to a mugistrate for exami-
nation. With this intention, he looked has-
tily round, intending to cause their immediate
apprehension; but the steam-boat had sailed
off; and allthe gesticulationas he could make
to bring them baok, only oaused the steward
laughingly to shake his head, thinking that
Martin had merely missed his passage, as he
deserved, for not showing more alaority in
obeying his injunetions to embark.

walked up and down in a stntoe of irrepressi-
ble irritation, clenehing his teeth, and grasp-
ing his walking-stiok firmly in his hand, as if
about to wreak instant vengeance on the mis-
creants. At length, after exhansting his in-
dignation, he took Henry again in his arms,
declaring ho would never for a moment lose
sight of him aguia.
Nothing in Henry's narrativoe threw the
smallest gleam of light on the plans or inten-
tions of tho strange man and woman, whieh
seemed destined toremain buried in impene-
trable obscurity. They had evidently been
aceomplices in decoying him from home; and

the boy had brought away from the steam-
boat, a small book which they had given
him, full of ribald songs, and profane jests,
but covered with magnificent boards, and
clasped with silver hinges, which seemed to
have onee belonged to some aneient missal,
and still retained in the inside, a eolleetion of
texts beautifully written in a very remarkable
hand, which seemed to be that of a highly-
educeated female.
For some time afterwards, several stuspi-
ious-looking people were seen lurking about
Sir Arthur'as premises, late at night; and one
evening a shot was fired suddenly in at the
drawing-room window, which passed so near
to Henry's head, that his hair was actually
disturbed; but though an aetive police had
been placed on the watch, not a trace could
be obtained of the authors of this outrage.
As time wore on, and the mind of Henry
rapidly expanded on all subjects of olassieal
learing and general science, the fearful and
melancholy events of his enrly years faded
considerably fromn his mind, while he made

his master he imbibed the most onlightened

for its precepts and praectice.
Sir Arthur felt a dreary blank during
Ioenry's absencee at school, which beeame
nore and more intolerable as his eyesight
was at lcngth nearly extinot; and he had so-
rious thoughts of engaging a person to walk

Sir Arthur often remarked to his friend,
.Lady Towereliffe, that it is a misfortne to
wear out a taste for any inoffensive oocupa-
tion; and he began to fear it might be pos-
sible for him to survive his onjoyment of
reading. `` In my long Iife,' he observet,
I have myself travelled all the travels de-
seribed by others, thought all the thoughts,
and felt aIl the feelinge. If I read sueh a
book as Rohertson's America, for instance,
the question forees itself upon me, ` what the
etter would I be of knowing this whole vo-
lume by heartI Tho time was once, when a
rormanco oarried me off into another existence
altogether, and I seemed to awaken as from
a dream, when callod backs to the ordinary
business of life; but now I can anticipate
fromn tho first page, the whole denouement of
every novel, and never for an instant forget
my own identity in reading the story.''

It is a shocking symptom of advancing
years,'' said Lady Towerlite. `But you
must wait till I publiah.''
e Yeat,'' contiued Sir Arthur, `` thore is
one volume always new, in which I never can
tire of reading my own hcart and charaeter
and in the Bible, tho descriptions of eastern
countries are so like what I have observed
yself of the seenery, customs, and manners,
that they fill me with recolleetions and asso-
ciations that are of endless interest,''
No sooner had Sir Arthur mentioned in-
cidentally, to Lady Towereliffe, and soveral
friends, that he wonld willingly gio a hand-
some salary to a porson of good reading and
writing abilitieA, than it sccmed as if all the
meritorious young en in Seotland happened
at that very time to be looking out for pre-
cisely such a situation; and it made Sin
Arthur almost melancholy in examining tes-

No situastion ever beeamo vaeant in the
memory of man, for whieh Lady Toereliffe
had not some protege exactly sited; and no
sooner did she hear that Sir Arthu required
a seoretary and reader, than she wrote him a
note of soven pages, elosely penned, in whioh
she made it evident that thero was but one
individual in the world who could suit, or
ought to suit, and that one individual was
the bearer of her despateh, who waited below
for an answer.
It appeared that, with all her zeal in the
cause, Lady Towereliffe knew vory little of
the young man she so vehemently reeom-
mended; bnt having aocidentally met him in
a bookseller's shop, he had been employed by
her to copy some veres in an album, and she
thought him, without exceeption, one of the
most civil and grateful creatures in the world,
who really deserved encouragement.

It was a favourite saying with Sir Arthur,
that he would be more ashamed to suspect
mankind, than to be deceived by them; and
if he hnd a weakness in the world, it was a
total ineapacity to gie pain. Touehed by
the nervous excitemont in Mr Howard's eye
and mannor, which he attributed entirely to
his necessitous oiroumstanees, he almost im-
mediately engaged him, to the entire satisfae-
 tion of Lady Towereliffe, who nover askedl or
cared any more about her protege, gratified
that she had aohieyed ``a job,'' and that by
her interest, and hers only, a place in the
world had been filled up, whieh would have been
occupied by some one else, perhaps equnlly
deserving, if she had not interfered, and she
was satisfied for the present, to have been of

His hollow, blood-shot eyes, betrayed a wild,
watehful, suspicious expression, by no moans

scrutable in the bland, perpetual smile he
nalways wore upon his countenanee, and in the
frozen tranquillity of his manner, which ocea-
sionally, though seldom, gave way to bursts
of tempestuous emotion. Tho very pupils of
his eyes seemed to become darkor, with a
fcarfully wild and ferocious expression when

Howard had become domesticated at Porto-

faney for the boy, would fetech and carry for
him liko a tame dog, and loadod him with

little cirele of her young and ardent friends.
Cast in the finest mould of elassisal beauty,
and formed mentally as well as personally in
the very poetry of nature, the perfeet grace
and symmetry of her fentures became en-
livened frequently by an areh and radiant
smile, like a Hebe, glowing with the richest
hues of health and joy. Her splendid eyes
sparkled with every passing emotion, some-
times dimmed for a moment by tears of sensi-

oceasionally, when amused or delighted, she
burst into a comie elfish laugh, the very es-

while her eonversation, always fresh and un-

The most stern and moroso of human be-

'' cheerful yesterdays and aonfident to-mor-

the birds that sang as she passed, the very
turf boneath her feet, and the sky above her
head, ealled forth her feelings. She had a
tear to spare for the sorrows of every one who
claimed her sympathy, and a ready smile for
the joys of all her companions, while yet a
great deal of unoccupied love remained at

her mind was deep as well as sparkling, while
during her early years sorrow flittei through

shadow of a butterfly in a bright sunny

merriment in all sho said, which attraoted a
joyous group of gay companions continually
around her, on whom the light of her own
buoyant vivaoity seemed to be continually
nnd brightly refleeted.
Nothing could be more pleasing and char-

she had not frequently made an ostentation
of posscssing more than it was possible for
her to use, and when Sir Arthur allowed her
a choiee, in any gift he was about to force
on her acceptance, she invariably seleeted
that which seemed least expensive; and her
ncle afterwards told, that when, on the
twelfth anniversary of her birth-day, he clasp-

associated. With her small mans, it was

self honourably aequitted.
Thug the foindation of Marion's mind was
laid, and these were the light breezes that
rufted the smooth current of her life; but en-
chanted by the slightest pleasures, few ever
bore the burden of her annoyanees so lightly,
while a brilliant painted eurtain hung over
the future, filled with images of anticipated
joy, to be realised in all their brightness and
beauty, as soon as she became emancipated
from the dreary thaldom of Mrs Penfold's
manufaetory of young ladies.
Meantime, Marion's mind grow and flour-
ished, like some rare and beautiful plant in-
judiciously oultivated, yet glowing in almost
unprecedented luxurianee. Plunged in this
inextrieable labyriith of edueational troublee,
she had to undergo lessons from sun-rise till

and languages were piled promiscuously on
her brain, like an ill-grown coppice, distorted

nature and properties; while, as Sir Arthur
eomplained, `` poor little Marion was taught
plenty of sound, but no sound sense, except
what she had inherited by nature, without
paying P100 a-year for it.'
In musie Marion displayed grcat taste and
expression, while her flexible, richly-toned
voice poured out somctimes a flood of har-

hcr full round intonations drew forth the
feeling and sypathy of all her auditors.

Before Marion had heen  long at echool,

duced a permanent and most happy effeot on
all her subeequent life and feelings. Clara

been nurtured, likoe her brother, in holiness,
and in every domestic excellence, while she
lived only for the dictates of a chastened and
sanctified henrt. . Delicate in health, and fra-
gile in extreme to appearance, there was some-
thing almost seraphie in tho delicate purity of
her lovely countenanee, and in the tranquil
composure of her graceful manner. During a
long and tedious illness, with which Clara was
seized, a short time before leaving school, she
testified a tender and almost exelusive affee-

the `` little fairy,'' as he called his favourite,

he said the only knowledge to be aequired
was, that knowlodge of the world which
ruins the heart, and where fascination was
to be taught as one of the fine arts, but all
his representations, whether in jest or in
earnest, were vain. Sir Patriok, being the
guardian of both his sisters, had determined
to expend a considerable part of the provision
bequeathed by their father in training them
up as carefully, for the course of fashionable
life, as he would have traied a promising

almost a habitual drudge in the usual routine

which excited the most intense euriosity among
her companions, but though she was gifted
with an oxtraordinary degree of apparently

Many were the restrietions and directions
given repeoting her to thescholars and teaeh-

and oppressive, that though the young lady
herself seemed neither surprised nor annoyed
by tho rigid watehfulness exercised over all
her motions, it excited among her companions
an indignant pity, and a keen spirit of parti-
zanship. She wasnever on any oeeasion
known to walk with the governesses and the
other girls beyond the narrow limits of the
high garden walls, and on Sundays, instead of
attending the parish chureh, it was observed
with surprise that ono of the teachers invari-

was fortunate, perhaps, that her large stock
of sympathy was not more frequently in re-

were sometimes imparted to her wondering

There arose, however, in time, one source
of individual anxiety to Marion, known only
to herself and Mrs Penfold, but it inereased
in weight and urgony evory year, throwing
oceasionally a shadow of eare over that bright
yUung countenance, in general so beaming
with joy, though with truo philosophy Marion
tried often to forget what it had proved im-
possible for her to remedy. Once a-quarter,
or at lcnst during eery sueceessive `` half,''
the mortifying faet forced itself upon her ob-
servation, that no bills were so irregularly
paid as her own, for while their amount
rapidly accumnlated, Sir Patriok's agent
forwarded annually the very smallest in-
stalments, with a thousand apologies, and
many promisoes of a final satisfactory settle-
ment at some future period, which period
never scemed any nearer; and Mrs Penfold
often dryly remarked, in the hearing of
Marion, that `` short aecounts make long
friends.'

feared lest his vehement partiality to herself
might lead him to overlook the very limited
nature of his own ineome, and to voluntee
some generous aerifice, such as she would
rathcr suffor any privations than occasion.
The pension and half-pay of Sir Arthur very
barely sufficed, sho knew, to defray his exten-
sive charitios, and to furnish somctimes thc
hospitable table, and tho bottle of first-rate
elaret, round which it was his delight to g-
ther a frequent cirele of old brother admi-
als; but his purse was little caleulated to
stand the shook of such a draft as Sir Puatrick
would unhesitatingly have drawn upon it, had
the idea occurred to him that Sir Arthur
might perhaps be induced to tako Marion's

it a matter of acecurate caleulation, to train

yet it was no part of his calculation to pay
for any thing in money, if he could do so in

thought she was on the eve of being paid;
but at lengrth her holidays came to a close,
and still not a syllable transpired respecting
her funds. Rendered desperate at last by
anxiety to re-enter school, Iaden with pre-
sents to her favourite companions, Marion,
who valued money only as a means of being
kind to others, ventured one duy, with glow-

a subject which suplied that lady with a

came so imbued at last with exation and

kept a cautious silenco respeoting all that
oonoerned herself.

Caroline was talking eagerly with great
animation, and telling Marion that the only
injury she never would forgive, was, if any of

inaudible murmur, and his hand plungod into
the breast of his coat, seemed as if it grasped
some weapon there, whilo Marion, taking ad-
vantage of his pre-oeeupied attention, darted
off with the speed of thought, and almost as
noiselesaly fled towards the house. A loud
angry cry to stop her, mingled with eurses
and impreeations, from the madman, while he
waed his singularly long arms menacingly
above his head, only aecelerated her paee,
while he followed some steps in pursuit; but
terror gave wings to her feet, and rushing
into tho entranee-hall, she instantly rang
the largo dinnor bell, and raised an alarm,
whioh assombled the whole household, all
of whom gazed with looks of panio-struck
astonishment at Marions palo and ghastly
countenanee.
Not a moment required to bo lost in expla-
nation, for MIrs Ponfold seemed at once to
guess the whole nature and extent of Caro-
line's danger, the instant her namo was men-
tioned ; therefore Mlarion had but to point out
the lireetion in which she might be found,

whcn Mrs Penfold hastoned forward, preeeled
by sevcral of the moro active servants.
WVhen Marion had rapilly executed some
orders committed to her, she quiekly returned
towards the arbour, but not a trace remained
there of any one. The little table had been
upsct, several branches torn down that sur-
rondod tho entranee, and the grass beneath
was mch trampled and disfigured; but all was
silent and desorted. Aftor one hurried glanee
of alar and perplexity, Marion hastened for-
ward to the garden gate, which she found had
been violently burst open, and on emerging
into the high road beyond, she thcre found
Mrs Penfold and her servants all erowding
round Caroline, who remained in a dead faint
on the ground for nearly half an hour.
A earriage was rapidly disappearing at full
speed in the distancee, but already almost too far
off to be distinguished; and Marion pereeived
the figure of a man lurking bchind the hedge
elose beside her; but when she made it evident
that he was observed, he rushocd up close to
her side, saying, in a threatening tone, betwcen

madman ?'
Seareely had Marion timo to utter an ex-
clamation of sudden affright, before he sprung
over the hedge, and was seen running aeross
the neighbouring fields, until his figure min-
gled with the surrounding gloom, and vanish-
vd out of sight.
Mrs Penfold's chief care, after Caroline'ae
recovery from her alarming swoon, was ear-
nestly to enjoin that the circumstances of this
adventure should nevor be mentioned, or so
much as remembered by those who had wit-
nessed them; a story so extraordinary and
alarming, being likely to injure her establish-
ment, besides causing much unnecessary gos-
sip among the younger pupils; but had Marion
even been disposed to consigu, as desired, the
whole adventure to oblivion, she could not but
be continually reminded of it for several
weeks afterwards, by the startled and agitated
manner of Caroline, whose frolicsome spirite
had ontirely deserted her, while she seemed
for some timo to bo in imminent danger of
188 MIODEN FLIRTATIONS.
a nervous fever. If any one appeared suddenly
in the room, she almost screamel with the
start it occasioned her; she could not bear
for a moment to remain alone, and seemed as
if continually listening, even when sale in the
house, for tho sond of stepns in pursuit of
her. Gradually, howevor, hor mind boeame
mnore oomposed, and she venturod one day to
take a stroll with Murion in somo of the
nearer parts of the garden, though evon there
she searcely spoke above hor brenth, and
turned hastily round several times, as if ap-
prchensive that some one approached.
Had the far-famed Upas tree grown over
the arbour, Caroline eould scarsely have
shunned more fearfully the slightest appoaeh
in that direction, and with equal oare did she
avoid any allusion to what had oecurrod
there, not a hint of which eer transpiredl in
her most confidential moments. Tho very
sound of her own feet on the gravel seemed
to startle her, and as she walked eneathi the
shade of some tall forost trees which over-
hung the garden-wall, Marion observed that

Caroline trod more cautiously; and though
she dropped not a word respeeting her feel-
ings or fears, it was evident that her nerves
were strung to an agony of sensitivenoess, for
the fluttering of a bird in a hedge, or the fall
of a leaf, made her start, and she seemed
about at last to give up the point in despair,
and hurry homewards, when suddenly a loud
shrill whistle arose amidst the brancehes of an
ash-tree, almost direetly over their heads, and
before Marion had time to look round, a
small paeket had dropped at the feet of
Cnroline.
With a half-suppressed cry of alarm, the
terrified girl fled, while Marion, seareely lese
frightened, instintively picked up the parcel,
and followed, while again sho was pursned by
a volley of onths and impreecations, which
ended in a laugh so wild, so maniacal, and so
fearful, that for months afterwards it rung in
her ears, causing her a shudder of horror and
alarm.
WVhen Mrs Penfold tore open an innumer-
able multitude of seals which closed the

paeket addressel to Caroline, she discovered
within only a long ineohervent letter of several
sheets, filled with tho most extravagant pro-
fessions of ardent love, nnd tho most ocho-
ment declarations, that nothing on earth
could impedo or disconrage him in his resolu-
tion to carry hor off, which he seeed still
persuadel, with the self-delusion peculiar to
mattness, must be a weleome assuranco to
Caroline, whose words and actions he perse-
veringly attributoed to the arbitrary influence
of others. Aecompanying this farrago of
mnost intolorable nonsense, was a blaek shade
in a wooden frame, representing the profile
of a young man, certainly handsome, and
which scemed to Marion like foeatures she
had known elscwhere, but being frequently
addicted to obscrving resemblances, she felt
at once persuaded that this must be some
such vague and unaecountable likenese as shc
had frequently found or faneiod before.
Time wore on, and still Curoline Iingered
at sehool, unwilling apparently to forsake
the comparative quietness of Mrs Ponfold's

MIrs Smythe was expeeted to convey her
home, Mrs Ponftold was bestowing on Caro-
line some of her last advice, on the most ap-
proved modes of `` getting on'' in society, and
espeeially on the manners and conversation
most attractive to gentlemen, when a note
was brought into the room, whioch had ar-
rived by express, bringing tho melancholy in-
telligeneo that Mrs Smythe's carriage had
been upsot a few miles off, eausing so severe a
blow on the head, that a conceussion of the
brain had taken plaee, and she continued in-

little hope remained of hor reeovery. The
Doetor who wrote these hurried particulars
had obligingly sent his own earriage and ser-
vant to convey Miss Smythe to the spot, that
sho might take a last leave of her dying rela-
tive, and he recommendod that she should
not lose an instant, or it might be too late to
find the sufferer in life.
Struel with grief and consternation by this
most uncxpected and calamitous intelligonce.
Caroline, though she had never before seemed
much to love her aunt, yet now becsme over-
wvholmed with the shock, and lost not an in-
stant in hastily preparing to obey the melan-
choly summons, by throwing on her clonk and
bonnet, while she rushed into the arme of
Marion, and burst into an agony of toars in
bidding her farewell.
Tho French governess who had heen sum-
oned to eseort Curolino in tho carriage, was
one of those nervous persons, who became
perfeetly frantic when hurried, and she flew
about the room, uttering a volley of inceo-
herent exolamations, expressive of her wonder
10DERN FLIRTATIONB. 193
and perplcxity at so sudden a eall on her ae-
tivity, while her preparations seemed to make
no visible progress. There is a seeret, mys-
terious pleasure in being waited for, which
every living mortnl seems to enjoy when they
have the opportunity; and without a thought
of Caroline's impatience, hor anxiety, and her
sorrow, Madame D'Aubert expreesed the
most eager and vehement solicitude about her
ow dress, and a resolution not to stir till
equipped to her entire satisfaction, for so
rare and almost unprecedented an event, as
lenaving the boundaries of Dartmore IHouse.
Every thing that has a limit, however,
must come to an end, and Mladame D'Au-
hbert's toilette being at last completed, she
leisurely advanced, talking to herself and to
everybody else, arranging her shawl, and
giving a last finish to tho contour of hoer bon-
net, before she threw herself with dignifled
deliberation into the ehariot.
MIarion had affcetionately insisted on con-
veying her weeping friend to the carriage,

length they exehanged a final embrase, and

placed her foot upon tho stos, while the
mnan-servant who aecompanied the carriagc
carefully assisted her in, before Marion sud-
denly sprung forward with an exelamation of
terror, scized hold of Curoline's dress, and be-
fore she could speak, dragged her foreibly
into thc house, axclaiming in aceecnts almost
inarticulato from alarm,

Before Marion eonld finish her sentence,
the supposed servant had violently seized
Miss Smythe by tho nrms, and was about
foreibly to drag her towards the oarriage,
when tho loud ories of Mnrion brought as-
sistaneoe. The almost fainting girl was res-

instantly vanished; and tho post-boy conld

promise of double payment if he implicitly
obeyed the gentleman, who seemed highly
irritable, and swore at him in a most fearful
manner, if he made the slightest delay, or so
much as asked a direction which way to turn.
The most diligent search was made, but
made in vain, by the offioers of police, to find
out the lunatic's retreat, which eluded their
utmost researeh; and as Caroline Smythe
was priately removed soon afterwards from

MRIoN's sister, Agnes, five years older than
herself, after being distinguished as the best
musician, best sketeher, best linguist, best
overything, at Mrs Penfold's, had left school
with no real knowlodge, oxceept of the most
frivolous kind, aeeidentally gathered in con-
versation, and repeated again in society like
a parrot. Formed to excite the most rap-
turous admiration, by the gorgeous magnifi-
conee of her almost regal beauty, art had aet-
ed the part of thoe Fairy Bountiful in form-
ing Agnes, while nature had showered her
ehoieest gifts on Marion.
MoDER LIRTATIONS. 197
Agnes was brilliant without being interest-
ing, and dazzling without beiug attractive, for
her mind seemed irremediably and ineorrigi-
bly ulgar, selfish, and vain. A good actress,
an inimitable mimic, and ineomparable in a
tableau, she assumed generally a queen-like
dignity of manner, ``stalking through lite,''
as Sir Arthur said, `` with an assured and
statcly step, as if practising for her appear-
ance as a Duchess at the next coronation.''
Admiration seemed to Agnes the only plea-
sure of life, and amusement its only business;
while, if ever shoe had possessed any sensibi-
lity, it was frittered away on the fietitious
sorrows of the Adelines and Julias in the
volumes which she read with surpassing dili-
gence from a cireulating library; though in
all -other respeets, Agnes wasted her time
amidst such listless idleness, that she might

neso mandarin, to testify how literally she

of others; but those who trase nothing cx-
cept evil in their oompanions, have seldom
muoh good in themselvos. Marion found it
one of the most important and pleasing stu-
dies in the world, to comprehend the charac-
ter nnd tomper of her frionds and connexions,
besides her own, with a wish to render her-
self suitable to them, ns her mind, pliable
without weakness, was bent on constantly
yielding her own wishes to those she loved;
bt this unobtrusive generosity was only a
subject of satirical remark to her sister, who
could neither understand nor believe in M-
rion's utter singleness of heart, and disinter-
osteinoss; her own sole aim being selfish in-
dulgonee, and her sole rule to obtain it in the
casiest possible way.
Selflove was the ruling passion of Agnes;
lovo of othors tho quickening principle, or
rather impulse with Mnrion, who would have
zealously planted flowers for oeven strangers
to enjoy ; but Agnes would havo pluekod all
thoso of her friends, and scarcely taken the
trouble to rear nny even for her own use.

Agnes, eold, vain, heartless, and self-suffici-
ent, thought she was made only for this
world, and this world for her, anid for such
us herself, young, gay, rich, and lovely, while
all others were mere intruders on the crea-
tion. But Marion, on the eontrary, followed
the dictates of her own heart, in wishing to
do good of every kind to overy person, while
still she had learned to aim ahove nature, to
that high standurd of Christian perfeetion, s
exalted, that those who have gained the most
olevated human attainment in virtue nnd ex-
celleneo, muast still consider the structure of
their minds, however beautifully deoorated
with generous sympathies and kind emotions,

dueed; but though the publie eye usually
grows weary of the same features, however
pcrfeet, during a second campaign, Agnes had
apparently taken out a diploma of beauty.,
tle reputation for which seemed confirmed to
others by her own thorough conviction of be-
ing completely unrivallod, and by tho oxult-
ing consciouasness she displaycd of hor own
supreme lovcliness. Three seasons of tumul-
tuous joy, triuph, and conquest, had already
sueceedod each other, during which Agnes
was, to use her own expression, `` fiereely
gay,'' yet still no younger rival had appeared
to eclipse the dazzling array of her charms;
and not a whisper was hcard that the fresh-
ness of her Raphael-like beauty was at all im-
pnaired; nor were any ladies over heard to
`` wonder'' what gentlemen oould possibly see
to admire in Agues Dunbar, as not a dissent-
ing voice had yet ventured to make itself au-
dible on that subjeet.
Agnes began life with that perfect confi-
doneo in her own knowledge of the world,
universally felt by young ladies under twenty,

specially when they have seen very little of
it, and with a thousand schemes and projeete
of perfeet happinesa. Though one aftor an-
other her castles of cards fell to thoe ground,
still, in the exercise of persevering enegy,
she rebuilt the eiifice again with new mate-
rials, and on wbat she imagined a bottor con-
struetion, but still in every instanco, to her
own unutterablo astonishmoent, she found that
most unaesountably, ``hope told a flattering
tale 
Considering overy officer she danced with
as a hero, and every gentleman who paid her
a compliment as a lover, Agnes wasted her
first season, as most young ladies do, in flirt-
ing with searlet uniforms, the inhabitants of
whiech were gonerally so much alike in ideas
and conversation, that if blindfolded, she
might have found it difficult or impossible to
distinguish which of her countless red and
gold admirers happened at tho moment to be
``doing the agroeable.''
All her military viatims were dying to know
what Ages thought of their brother offieers:

whethor she intended to adorn the next bnll

sho likced their military band; if she proposed
patronising their night at the theatro; whe-
ther she preferrel a galope fast or slow; how
she thought tho colonel's daughter looked on
horseback; whother sho did not think it bar-
barously tyrannical of the commandor-in-chief
to insist on their all wearing uniforms; how
she liked the new regulation jacket; nnd
above all, whether she thought the order
for their wearing mustachios an improvement
or notl
To all these subjects, and many more of
similar import, Agnes lont hor very profound
attention, not only during the diseussion, but
in many a solitary hour, while her whole
head, leart, and understanding wero erowded
with the recolleotion of oepaulettes, musta-
chios, spurs, and gold laee, and she privately
belioved that the supreme felicity of earth,-

Sir Patrick laughingly allogod that Agnes
hnd rehearsed a set of prepared eonversations
suited to every different oeeasion,-a musieal
conversation for amateurs, full of crotehets
and quaYers,-a hunting conversation about
foxes, dogs, and steeple-chases,-a Court of
Session conversation for the layers,-and a
dragoon oonversation, discussing at great
length whether offiecers should dance with
spurs or without them, and in which she had
been known to ennmerate correctly, thoe fae-
ings of every regiment in Her Majesty's ser-
vice.
Her brother often and loudly deelared that
nothing is more perfeotly hopeless, than for
any young lady to expect a seriouns attaeh-
ment from an offieer actually quartered with
his regiment, as it was against all rule, and
contrary to all nature or eustom, for Cupid to
attaek the army. The mess-table, he assured
her, invariably sete its face against matri-
mony, and the mess-table conversation was an
ordeal, through which he protested that few
young ladies could wish their names to pass;

but nevertheless, Agnes, full of groundless ex-
peetations and lively vanity, continued to en-
dure a succession of heart-rending and unac-
countable disappointments, from very promis-
ing military admirers, who had stolen her
bouquets, listened to her music, nnd drunk Sir
Patriek's claret month after month; but no
sooner did marching orders como for Dublin,
Leeds, or Canada, than these interesting
affairs came to an untimoly end with a P.l.C.
eard, or a sort of nover-expect-to-mcet-again

in her hand, wondering what regiment would
come next, and whether there were many un-

 Who, and what uroe Mrs and Miss

to herself, never apparently to obtain a satis-
factory answer. On Carolino leaving school,
her aunt had taken a villa at Portobello.
where the two English strangers excited ex-
treme attention, more from their ovident de-
sire to avoid it, than from any thing very
remarkable in their appearanee or manner,
though Mrs Smythe was certainly of that
genus old maid so common in England, with a
handsomo independeneo, a suite of sorvants, a
pony-cearriage, most splendid dress, and somc
pretensions still to youth and beauty, as any
fragmcnt of good looks that yet remained she
most liberally displayed; while her manner
had a flirting tone of coquetry most unsuit-
able to her apparent age, forming a singular
contrast to the quaker-like simplicity of Ca-
roline's dress.
MIODERN FLIRTATIONB. 211I
There was a singular eontrast between the
gravity of costume affected by Miss Smythe,
and the keen festivity of spirit with which she
entercd into every scheme of amusement, or
even, it might be said, of mischiet. Her viva-
city was oeeasionally almost overpowering,
her faney lively beyond example, while with
her brilliant, yet interesting animation, there
was mingled a rare acuteness of mind, a swift
omprehension, and an innate passion for all
that was amiable or beautiful, which gave live-
liness and vigour to what she said, though the
rapidity of her mind sometimes led Caroline to
a false estimate of persons and ciroumstances,
as she always judged or aoted from instantane-
otus impulse; yet there was a generous frnnk-
ness in her disposition, which captivated those
who knew her, and a graceful simplicity in all
sho did, which gave it interest; for, without
intention, there was something in all her
thoughts or actions, striking and peculiar.
Her features, though irregular, attracted
and enchaine the eye, from the magieal
variety of their expression, and though an

of physiognomy was delighted to find therc
an ever-varying sourco of interest in watch-
ing the bright emanations of thought, feel-
ing, and vivacity, which glittered or spurk-
lod in her eye, or played about her mouth.

with whom they requested a priate confer-
enee, the purport of whieh did not transpire.
From that day, an intimaey, amounting
to friendship, was established between Sir
Arthur and the two ladies, who seemed on all
oecasions to look to him for advice and pro-
teetion, and in whose house they spent a part
of every day, to the unspeakable delight of

aoter of his young protege, as it gradually
arose to personal and intolleetual suprcmacy
His mind was ardont, courageous, and deeply
contemplative, full of genorous impulses, but
apnt to view all that happened to himselt
through anu exaggerated medium. His mys-
terious history, and the fascination of his
manner and appearanee cast a spell over tho
interest and affections of all who beheld his
oountenance, or heard the sound of his har-
uonious voieoe. With a strikingly handsomo
person, he had alresdy acquired a decided air
of fashion and refinement, while a bright vein
of almost chivalrous romance which onlivcened
is mind, was subdued by a poetical temera-
ment, inclining him to dwell much on melan-
choly msings, relating to the strange circum-
stances of his own early history. IKeenly sen-
sitive to kindness or neglect, his love and gra-
titude to Sir Arthur were without bounds,
and his brotherly affeection for Marion was
tinged with tho natural enthusiasm of his dis-
position, but before long the warmest and

deepest feelings of his nature were seeretly
concentrated on the ga, giddy, and fasciuat-
ing Curoline Smythe. Every srap of paper
that came in his way became covered with
sketchos of her buoyant figure and graceful
profile, in a variety of animated attitudes; or,
on other oceasions, verses in Latin or English,
little better certainly than the nonsense verses
at school, immortalised her charms.
Young as he was, however, Henry's spirit
recoiled already from tho danger of loving too
well, or being beloved by any, when he was
taught, in hours of solitary relection, to re-
member that principle and honour must for-
bid him to seeks a mutual attacehment, while
his name and station remained unknown, and,
perhaps, disgraeeful. There was a bewilder-
ing power in Caroline's society, which chained
him to her side wherever they met, while, con-
trary to his resolutions and wishes, his every
look, smile, word, and action became steeped
in loe. Often and severely did ho upbraid

tle delight of listening to her gay sallies and
her delicious laugh; though the mirth of henr
young eyes became veiled often by a look of
care as suddon, as it was to him unaccount-
able, being so foreign to the sparkling, almost
mieehievous gayety of her nuture.
Henry's devoted, and nearly boyish nttaeh-
ment, raised in his heart many a high aspira-
tion after future distinction, many a bright
hope of honour, promotion, and usefulness.
Tho model for his imitation in cvery thing
noblo and distinguished was Sir Arthur, and
he rcsolved to saerifice lovo itself, till he had
attained, liko him, a name and a station for
himself. The very sound of Sir Arthur's step,
the very tones of his voiee, wcre dear to him:
and, casting nside every softcr emotion con-
neetod with his romantie reveries respecting
Caroline, he beocame impatient to face the
bitter blasts of the world's trials, taking his
boeloved benefaetor for his example, and the
Holy Seriptures as his guide.

awfulness and solemn obligations.''
Knowledge is power, and knowledge of
character is the greatest power of all, but
Henry, in general very penetrating, was per
plexed by the flirting, light-headed manner of
Mrs Smythe, whenever she was in the socioty
of gentlemen her own contemporaries in age
and tho grave doforential manner she adopted
towards her young companion, whom she
seemed to treat almost inadvertently as her
superior, though the slightest indication of hen
doing so usually brought the ready colour of
Caroline in vivid flashes to her cheek, and
caused an appearance of mutual embarrass-
ment between the aunt and niese, which sur-
prised and puzzled him. Their oxtraordinary
munificence to the poor and publio charities
also astonished him, as that appeared so
widely disproportioned to their visible menns
and usual oxpenditure, though it seemed only
to please without surprising Sir Arthur, who
was aceustomed to give so liberally himelf,
that Henry sometimes feared he encouraged

his newly-found friends in a degree of lvish
extravaganee, inconsistent with the ordinary
means of single ladies;, yet all was given with
a graeeful negligent indifferenee to the vulgar
subjcet of pounds, shillings, and penee, quite
unprecedented. Sbsceriptions to church ex-
tension, missionaries, sehools, Bibles, blankets,
food, olothing, ooals, money, and medicine,
were scattered around them with unsparing
profusion, though it appeared to Henry, that.
in the case of Mrs Smythe herself, whose
name always appeared ostensibly on the list
as the larger contributor, there was less ala-
erity in giving, than in Caroline who seemed
to be purse-bearer for both, and always de-
frayed the whole amount.
Among the many things whioh surprised
Henry in Mrs and Mias Smythe, nothing had

mentionod rathcr contemptuously some vague
rccolleetions of him formerly as a pcrt, awk-
ward school-boy, while, to Honry's inereasing
perplexity, tho young lady's colour visibly
rose to carnation whenever he was unexpect-
edly named, and her eyes usually glittered
with a suppressed smile, if any aneedote or
deseription in Sir Arthur's convorsation re-
lated to himn, till at length the curiosity which
had so long been eidently fermenting in tho
minds of Mre and Miss Smythe, exploded one
day in the form of an eager request, that Sir
Arthur would invite Captain De Crespigny to
mneet them at dinner.
Morion and Henry were amused at the
laughing alacrity with which Sir Arthur at
onee consented, and they observed, after the
noto was despatehed, that many a whispered
consultation took place, and many a merry
jest passed among the lively trio, to whieh
they were not made a party, while the to

rion would have given worlds to witness the
seene, but her furlugh from Mrs Penfold's
had expired on the very day of Sir Arthur's
party, and she was most unwillingly deposited
in a earriage with her baggage, at the mo-
mont when Captain De Crespigny alighted in

had conveyed him from Piershill.

upon himsolf as her natural property, and
handed her to dinner, though no formal pre-
sentation had taken place.
With Cuaroline he was, before long, flirting

charming look of eonsciousness when he ad-
dressed her, reeeiving the whole artillery of
his small talk and civilities with a most inter-
esting xpression of naivete, though onee

a look of covert humour lurked in her eye,
and quivered on her lip, that he could not
but wonder at tho grave demure look which
sho affeected.
Nothing was cver more enchanting to Cap-
tain Do Crospigny than the blushing averted
looks with which Cnaroline listoned to all his
insinuated admiration, while now and then
she nodded and smiled with the prcttiest air
of ineredulity imaginable, if he professed it
more oponly. Oecasionally, however, Captain
De Crespigny was almost put out of counte-
nanee by her vory unexpested replies, or very
nal-apropos questions, , wivhich gradually led
him on, he searcoly knew how, into flirting
perfeetly d I'outranee,  while opportunities
seemed purposely afforded him with a degree
of tact perfectly inerediblo in one so young,
and apparently unsophistieated, to say even
nore than he had evor said boeforo. With a
gay, laughing animation, almost amounting to
silliness, the young lady archly doubted his
sincerity, admired his wit, and slyly misunder-
stood all his compliments, till he was obliged

to repeat his meaning, and explain his insinu-
ations, making his professions and speeches
all so exeeedingly plain and undisguised, that,
to his own astonishmoent, he found himself
positively making love, on a very few hours
aequaintanee, with a degree of explicitness
which had never ocenrred to him in the whole
course of his practiee before.
In the evening Caroline was, after many en-
treaties, prevailed on to favour Captain Do
Crespigny with a song, and never had he been
so completely perplexed, as by those with
which the young lady, preserving a look of
most imperturbable gravity, proceeded to fa-
vour him. She seemed to have a dozren diffenr-
ent voiees, and half-a-dozen different styles of
performance, but had evidently been well
taught, and displayed oceasionally some beau-
tiful notcs. At first hcr tones wero elear and
sharp, aecompanied by the strangest flourishes
and eadenees that Captain De Orespigny had

At one tie her tone reminded him of a well-

persuaded she was taking off Olara Novello;
ocoasionally thero was so considerablo a tinge
of the brogue, that he beeame eonvineel she

screaming  peacock, but adopting thc air
and attitudo of a Catalani, and coneluded with
looking cxultingly round in expeetation of rap-
turous applause, which Sir Arthur bestowed
in abundance, and Cuaptain Do Crespigny in
comparative moderation, being for tho first
time in his life at a loss to kow whether he
were treatcd on this oecasion in jest or in
oarnest.

and conversation. Sho displayed, along with
a most extravagant love of amusement, a ge-
nius for satire and mimicry quite unprece-
dented, and in which she most freely in-
dulged. Many a scene was aeted over by
her, and supported by Henry with astonish-
ing talent and vivacity, for both seemed to
havo a similar propensity, being able, after an
hour's intercourse with any individual, to imi-
tate his whole peeuliarities with almost ragi-
cal precision,-to follow in an imaginary eon-
versation the very train of his ideas, and to
represent every little triok or habitual expres-
sion, every tumn of the head, and every tone
of the voice, with a gay look of mookery
which wonld have made their fortunes on the
stage.
One evening, Sir Arthur having delivsered
up to his young friends the key of an old
chest, filled with velvet eoats and broceaded
silks dressoes, formely worn by his bye-gone
aneestors, Caroline, Henry, and Captain De
Crespigny amused themnselves by grouping

peared in similar costumes, as Shakespeare's
two Dromios in the Comedy of Errors, when
Sir Arthur suddenly exclaimed, as if he had
made some great discovery,`` How very

Hcnry laughingly received these remarks
as an undoubted compliment, and bowed with
good-humourel graee to Sir Arthur, who ob-
served with astonishment that Captain De
Crespigny's colour rushed to his very temples,
and receded again, leaing his countenance
palo and almost ghastly, while he suddenly
brokce off the entortainment, and strode up to
the fire-plnce, where for sone minutcs he
stood, with his baek to the company, in evi-
dent agitation, while a dead silence ensued.

line, `` I have often been told that people are
never pleased with a likceness, but certainly
Louis Do Crespigny is the most eoneeited of
men, to feel so intolerably angry at being
compared to my young friend here. There
are certainly worse-looking people in the
world than Henry I' added the Admiral,
with a look of partial affeotion.` And it
was no such insult as De Crespigny seems
to think, when I paid him the compliment,
to say that he resembled my boy, who
ias in every respect the very pride of my
heart.''
I wish the Captain may never meet with
a greater mortification,'' replied Caroline,
laughing; ``and I am sure he would be much
the better of a few pretty severe ones to
keep him in his senses''
Henry meantime had observed with good-
humoured surprise, and no small degree of

to the oeeasion, into which Captain De Cres-

A vivid flush passed over the whole fore-
head and features of Captain De respigny
at these words; but assuming a sudden tone
of liveliness and vivaecity, he summoned Henry
to continue their entertainments for the even-
ing, which were to be coneluded by acting a
proverb, of which Sir Arthur and his guests
were to diseover the design. Miss Smythe,
dressed in cottage costume, seated hereelf
pensively on a stool, after which Captain De

and carrying on his back a quiver filled with
all the old pens in the house to represent ar-
rows, entered in the charaetoer of Love, anl

girl, when Honry, disguised in a tattorol old
cloak, to porsonate poverty, limped slowly
into the room. On seeing this beggarly ap-
parition, Cupid, pushing his hair up till it
stood on end, assumed an expression of comic
horror, and with a shriek of dismay, rushod
to the window, as if abont to jump out.
The wholo party laughed heartily, and de-
clared that the denouement of this picce con-
tained a most salutary lesson against a mere
love-match; and Sir Arthur said, for his own
part he would attend to tho wurning,-that
all portionless yoeung ladies might eonsider
tho case hopeless with him, and he trusted
evcry one present intended to be equally pru-
lent.

tain De Crespigny. ``' I am almost temptod

Captain De Crespigny was bowing himself
off late in the evening, and taking a voery par-
tieular leavo of Miss Smythe, having oallaed
up all his most fascinating graces for the oe-
casion, while he felt inwardly gratified by the
pleasing conviction that another had been
added to the list of young ladies whom he
had made miserable for life, when he was

nortifieation and anger which he was ashamed
to allow even to himself.
When Captain De Crespigny hurriedly
opened the drawing-room door, near which
he and Caroline had beon standing, ho was
surprised to sco a person lurking close behind
it, who dartod instantly away and disappeared;
but beforo the intruder was out of sight, an
exelamation of torror nnd dismay escaped
from the lips of Caroline, who rushed towards
Sir Arthur, exelaiming in aecents of almost
frantic alarm,'` He is thoro he is there.

Captain De Crespigny instinctively ran in

` There is something next to supernatural

most breathloss agitation. `` One would ima-

'I shall escort you with tho whole party in

assume a rallying tono.  Old Martin and
myself are quite invulnerable, and I only wish
y seoretary were also herc, as he would be n

The night being impenetrably dark, and
not a sound to be heard but tho echo of their
footsteps on the gravel, when Mrs Smythe
alighted from her carriage to walk across the
garden leading towards her house, Sir Arthur
immediately desired the servants to bring out

dark shadows eoncealed all but his faoe,
in whieh there gleamed a look of maniaeal
triumph and malignity, while rushing elose up
to Captain De Crospigny, he said in a threat-
ening tone, low and distinet, `` He who erosse
my path shall diel'' and instantly disappeared
through the hedge. Whan Miss Smythe, on
hearing hias voiee, with a stifled scream of ten-
ror led into tho house, again that loud and
fiendish laugh, which she had already heard
once, arose behind her, and rung through the
night air in tones of high delirium, eausing a
cold shuddor to thrill through the hearts of
even tho boldost among her companions, while
they hastily followed her, and having placed
tho trombling gisl in apparent safety, soon
after took leave, charging tho servants to
chain and double-loek the door.
It was some hours before Caroline could
sufficiontly compose her mind to retire; but af-
ter the house was perfectly quiet, and the ser-

that her nerves might become less painfully
agitated. Theslightest noise eaused her eart
to beat almost audibly, and she was onscious
that a mouse rattling in the wainscot would
have caused her to faint. Mrs Smythe could
scarccly be prevailed upon to leave hor alone,
bt as they both slept on the drawing-room
lloor, only divided by a thin partition, Caro-
line induced hcr at a late hour to withdraw.
while not a sound now disturbed the dcep re-
pose of nature, but ``the wailing sorrows of
some midnight bird.''
The moon had arisen, shining with softencd
radiance into her apartment, when Miss
Smythe arose from her devotions, and she
conld not but thinks at the moment what a
bright emblem of her divine Saviour that glo-
rious luminary precsented to the mind, not
glowing liko the sun with a radianee which no
human eye can gaze upon, but refleeting upon
the darkened earth a mild subdued refulgenee,
perfectly suited for the steady contemplation
of those whom it had arisen to benefit and
cheer.

Pleased with sueh thoughts, a gradual com-
posure stole over her senses, and Caroline at
length, seeing her candle nearly burned out,
consequently determined to retire for the
night. Not a sound was to be herd in the
house, but her own light step, as she mo-
ed about the room,-the very opening of a
drawer, or the shutting of her book, sounded
nnnaturally loud, jarring upon her nerves with
a startling effeet,-the shadows in the more
distant part of the room looked darker than
usual, and the least moan of tho wind in-
ereased the painful tension of her nerves to
agony. Searcely had she begun to undress,
when a sndden noise not far off caused her to
start with eonvulsivo terror, her heart beoame
ehilled with apprehension, the candlestiok
which she carried in her hand foll to the
ground, the light was extinguished, and she
stood trembling and alone in total impenetra-
ble darkness.

Caroline tried to persuade herself that the

excitcd fancy,-she lookod around and all was
quiet,-she listoned and all was perfectly still.

solute to try whothor sloep might not plunge
her into forgetfulness and peace, when her
attention was accidentally attracted towards
one of the windows, where tho bright moon-
beams rested on an object which soemed to
blast her eyes with horror, and paralyzed her
at once in a speechless agony of fear. The
top of a ladder rested on the window-sill,
npon the summit of which stood the dark
figure of a man, his faco plastered so olose
upon the glass, that his nose was perfectly
flattened against it, and his hands raised in a
menacing attitude towards her. he instant
he saw, by Curolino's look of frantic alarm,
that she had seon him, he dashed in the win-

ar, and seemed about to make a forocible en-

The servants were speedily assembled around

but, convulsed in every nerve, and throwing
herself into the arms of Mrs Smythe, with
a cry of thankfulness and agitation, she
faintod.
An instant alarm was given in the neigh-
bourhood,-a diligent seareh was made,-and
the police for several days exerted their ut-
most activity to detect the miscreant, but in
vain. Not a trace remained to convince Caro-
line that the whole had not been a hideone

he felt, and observed, in his usual off-hand style,
that this wasnot the only man whose hcad she
would probably turn, but in his own ease.
though she had nlmost put him out of his
senses already, yet he would rather make an
end of himself than of her.
Caroline dryly thanked him for his obliging
intentions on her behalf, and after a lively
dialogue, in which the gay huzzar actually es-
celled himself, in his forvent expressions of ad-
miration and regard, he tool leave, rathen
wondering to think how he had been led on in
professing so much, and giving himself a lee-
ture as he rode home, on the propriety of be-
ginning to `` back out,'' seeing that he was
getting rathor beyond his depth. Still there
were several of the reasons for meeting next
day, usual with those who have a natural
desire to improve an agreeable intimacy,--a
song to be praetised,-a drawing to be admir-
ed,-and Miss Smythe having made a sort of
promise to let Captain Do Crespigny sit to

delay, the door was opened by a shabby awk-

having an idea apparently, that she ought her-

very uncommon in Ireland. Attired in a mili-

coarse, and dirty, which looked as if they hnd
been curled over knitting wires. Taking the
last remnant of a cigar out of his mouth when
tho visitor entered, and slowing not the small-

of dingy decayed teeth, and a very disfiguring
squint, he watched the approaehing step of
Captain De Crespigny with a degag6 look of
indifference, saying in a tone of easy familiarity.

lip, in angry embarrassment, while, with a

eyed his companion, who thrust his hands into
his ample pockets, and paced up and down
the room with rapid strides and determined
emphasis. At longth, stopping opposite to
his irritated companion, he oyed him for some
moments, with a look of stern reproaeh, say-
ing, in a stronger Irish brogue than ever, and
with a torrent of indignation, which gave al-
most the dignity of oloquence to what he ut-

Captain De Crespigny began now to feel
seriously annoyed at his own position1 Not
having latoly been quartered in Ireland, he
had forgotten how such affairs are managed
there, but at this moment a thousand recol-
lections erowded upon him, of warnings he
had received from his brother officers respect-
ing the prudenee and cireumspeetion to be
exercised beside the Shannon, though most of
what they said, had been listened to with the

same ineredulous attention usually bestowed
upon stories of ghosts and witeheraft. Here
he was, howover, snared like a fly in a spider's
web, though without a single doubt of his
own powers to escape, and with no stronger
objeetion to eall out this insolent ruffian be-
side him, than the publicity and ridicule
wshich he must inevitably incur, if involved in
a vulgar eery-day duel with a hot-hecnded
lrishman.
Seeing that tho affair was likely to take a
graver turn than he had imagined, Captain
De Crcspigny now slowly and resolutely
strode towards the hearth-rug, and turning
his baek to the fire, in that attitude peeuliat
to Englishmen, calmly and sternly looked in
the faee of his insolent companion, whose lip
became compressed with an air of fiercoe de-
termination, while his dark eye glittered with
a triumphant smile, and in an attitude of per-
fect oncalance, he returned Captain De

sming his lounging attitude on the sofa.

both looked equally angry, till the Irihman
at length opened a pocket-book, to whioch he
frequently afterwards referred, with a busi-

triumph, saying,

most delirious with rage, and drawing in hise
breath between his clenehed teeth, while the
Irishman eyel him with provoking coolness,
and merely muttered in eply, while still re-
ferring to the poeket-book,

as if some irresistible faoeling had eome over

with a slight quiver in his voice, as if on the
very eve of laughtor, though Captain Dc

while looking out of tho window, these words,
with very marked omphasis,-

Cnptain De Crespigny fixed his eyes with
stern contempt pon his freo and esy com-
anion, who passed his fingers through his
long bushy wig, stretehed his leg upon the
sofa, and spoke with a yawning voice, while
he added in a careless off-hand way, '`If my

Captain De Orespigny paused a moment,
irresolute what to do. It was a condescen-
sion quitoe intolerable, to have another mo-
ment's intercourse with sueh a man; and to
sign any paper at his request, seemed almost
a degradation; but then he saw before him
a long vista of vulgar annoyances from this
forward Irishman. He was aware that hun-
dreds of gentlemen would Iaugh, if the story
got any publicity, and that dozens of young

beeame cireulated that his attentions had

with great spirit and vivaity, till Henry sud-
denly bccame conscious, that in imagining tha
words of another, he was gradually betrayed
into cxpressing his own real feelings, and that
too, with a depth and farvour which sineerity
alone could have dictated.
Cheeking himself in a moment, while the
olour rushed to his faee, dyeing it red to the
vry roots of his hair, and instantly receded
again, he took a hurriod leave of Mrs Smythe,
and turning to Caroline with a quivering lip,
he said, in a voice which none but herolf

his haste accidentally thrown down, ho began
hastily collesting its eontents, when his sur-
prise was great, on turning up one sheet of

exeeedingly flattered; but still it could be no
other; and the picture dropped from his
hand in the transport of his delight.
Henry again returned to the portfolio, hur-
riedly turning the leaves over; and amidst a
variety of superbly-finished miniatures, he
found his own countenance ovor and over
again grouped in animated contrast with that
of Sir Arthur. His heart throbbed with joy,
when, after hastily turning to the title-page.
he discovered, aceording to his hopes and
wishes, the name of Caroline Smythe; and

month at Lady Towereliffe's in Fife, evidently
labouring under a depression of spirits very

throw off the cloud of melaneholy, tinged very
strongly with ill-humour, which had so sud-

of the senses and the happiness of the present
honur, while he thought it too long a look-out
to anticipate what might happon the day
after to-morrow. In respeet to Sir Patriek's
reputation, a vague understanding seemed to
prevail that all was not right, yet no explicit
explanation seemed ever to be obtained.
Something there was- what, nono presumod to say,

Though Sir Patriek Dunbar was eager and
rapacious in acquiring money, and would in-
eur any meanness to avoid paying it, he seem-
ed, nevertheless, lavish, and what some people
mis-called generous, in squandering what he
called his own. Though cold and selfish in

and his heart, till now hermetically sealed
against all real confidenoe and friendship,
waa now for the first time unolosod, in its in-
most recesses, while even his haekneyed mind
seemed to catch a ray of light and warmth
from the sunny freshness and purity of Clara's

humour, had eompletely takoen him by sur-
prise, being as fresh and gentle as a summer

Captain De Crespigny's jilting propensities
were the less dangerous, from their eing so

willing that tho unwary should suffer, rather
than his faults be exposed to censure; but
Mr Granville, by not giving his sister timely
warning against the dissipated extravaganee
and almost infidel principles of his old school-
companion, had now unfortnately exposed
her to a danger he had not anticipated, as it
never oecurred to his imagination, in its wild-
est fancies, tlat the reokless dissolute Sir
Patrick, who had long sneered at marriage,
and even broken that holy tie for others,
might find a charm in tho pure, calm, high-

conld most like or admire. During their

he really was, owing to the respect with
which he treated all hor opinions, and only

lis evident ignorance of the forms of devo-
tion: yet knowing his edueation hal been
finished by a clergyman, she supposed he
must have imbibed a due respeet for the or-
dinances; while Lady Towercliffe, indulging
her usual jobbing propensities, was enchanted
to make up a match of any kind in her ow
house, and praised Sir Patriole us the most

he had aequired over her thoughts and aflee-

mnanner had pleased her, his amusing conver-
sution had enlivened her, and at length his
ardent professions of attachment intereited
her deeply, being expressed with all the elo-
quenee of natural feeling.
Clara, in the gloomy reeesses of Mrs Pen-
fold's sehool-room, had learned nothing of the
world, and her heart at once, therefore, en-
lowed Sir Patriok with all those amiable
qualities which he assumed, while she yielded
herself to the most pleasing of all earthly
dreams, that of loving and being beloved by

Patriek is by no means to be trusted with the

groan which struggled for utterance, she cover-

be blotted out by her tears. They all lay
prostrate and disfigured at her feet, seorch-
ed and blasted as if by lightning, and her
heart, bowildered by a multitude of thoughta
and emotions, seemed full almot to burst
ing.
Clara wept many bitter tears over her let-
ter, and she not only wept but acted. With-
out delay, Clara prepared to return to the
relation with whom, during her brother's ab-
sence, she usually found a home; and before
her departure, not only wrote to Sir Patrick,
stating in terms of touehing grief, all her rea-
sons for so suddenly and unwillingly withdras-
ing from her engagement to him; but she had
a long and most afflicting interview with him,
vainly endeavouring to convinoe her lover, that
their total incompatibility of sentiment raised
a barrier betwoen them, which forbade the
possibility of thoir union.

are better hopes and higher duties, which bind
me to follow them, even though death were

Si Patriok olenehed his hands vehement-
ly together, while his countenance burned
and muttering a curse between his teeth,
which chillod the blood of Clara in her veins,
he walked about the room with rapidly in-
ereasing exseitement, till at length, astopping
before her, he said in aceents of angry re-
proach, `` Yonu have spoken my doom, Olara;

No words could do justice to the silent
ogony of Clar's young heart, when in solitary
grief she retraced her whole intimacy with Sir
Patriek, and refleeted that she had bid a last
adieu to one whom she must not esteem, and
yet could not but love. All that this world
could offer she had rejeeted for conscience
sake. A cold frost soemed to gather around
her spirit, while trembling and depressed, shc

Mnrion Dunbar, fresh in the spring-tide of
youthful bloom, had nearly completed her
seventeonth year, and was hurrying on still
in a whirlpool of education at Mrs Penfold's,
excrting horsolf more zealously for the credit
of her teachers than she ever would have done
for her own.
One evening about this time, a message
reached Marion, desiring that she woull in-

solemn summons to which was usually of omi-
nous imnport. Marion, however, eonseious
that her own recent diligence had been quite
pre-eminent, and her suceess most distin-
guished, heard the word of command with a
flutter of pleasing anticipation, for to her the
future was always full of hope. Too old now
for medals and ribbons, she yet indulged in
the gay recolleotion of former triumphs, ad
remembered, with a smile, as she hurried up
tairs, how often Sir Arthur had formerly de-
clared, while pretending to frown upon her
that ``he hated to see girle flouneing about
with medals, and defying tho world'' yet how
slily, when she one day entered his drawing-
room, with deopening colour, and a look of
inodest consciousness, half concealing and
half displaying her honours, he had advanced
to meet her, wearing his own Grand Cross of
the Bath, to provo, as he said, that he was
indeed fit company for so meritorious a young
laly.
302 MIODERN FLIRTATIONS.
Humming a fuvourite air, with a buoyant
joyful step, and radiant smile, Marion hasten-
el to the door of MIrs Penfold's apartment,
where, after trying to compose her fentures
into a suitable expression of sober respeet,
with dimpling cheek, and still almost laugh-
ing eyes, sho entered, making, as she had been
taught, tho nsual respcetful courtesy exacted
by Mrs Penfold, such as might have beoen suit-
able for an introduction at Conrt, or for n
public performer receiving the plaudits of a
numerous audience, and then, with a bright
speakiug look, full of hope and vivaeity, she
paused, to aseortain the objecet of her unex-
peeted summons.
To Marion's astonishment and dismay, Mrs
Penfold was paeing about the room, evidently
in a state of furious irritation, while in her
hand she curried that endless bill, the growth
of many years, for board, edueation, masters,
and sundries, whioh had so often already
greeted the unwilling eyes of her young pu-
pil, whose whole inward spirit reeoiled with
shame and apprehension, whilo sho silently

measured the length and breadth of its con-
tents, eery item of which she already knew
by heart, and could almost have recapitulated
without a prompter.
Had Marion herself been a ruined gamester
or a spendthift, she could scareely have felt
more guilty and ashamed than now; but af-
ter standing an entire minute without being
obsorvod, and perceiving Mrs Penfold un-
able to speak, from the effort it oost to re-
strain her anger within deeent bounds, Marion,
with the frankness natural to her candid dis-

Unable to speak from constornation, though
suel scenes were already but too familar to
her memory, MIarion fixod her eyes on the un-
weleome bill, apparently examining its con-
tents, while her thoughte were in the mean time
painfully occupied in devising what would be
right for her to say or do in this unexpected
risis. A long pause onsued, during which
Mle lenfold seemed resolute not to speak;
thorefore Marion, with a strenuous offort, on-
deavoured to new-string her norves, and say
something, whilc the large heavy tears forced
themselves into her eyes.

listened, with a dry, harsh, unmoved expres-
sion of eountenanee.

MIarion's heart was melted by oven this
very slight exprossion of regard, and nothing
conld exceed the troubled beauty of her eyes
when she raised them gratefully to Mrs lPen-
fold, but conscious that her presence was not
oxactly the plaee for a scee, as that lady had
long been considered incapabloe of a tear or a

Iater, to see it done! Now let me go in-

Mrs Penfold most heartily secondod her
pupil's desire to depart, while one of the hea-
viest pangs which Marion had to endure on
this oceasion, sprang from the stern angr
roldness with which her ci-devant preceptrcse
appeared about to bid her a last farewell.
A tumult of gossiping wonder and cn-
riosity arose among the pupils, when it be-
cae whispered that Mnrion was to `` lcave''
on an honr's notice. Many questions were
asked, much astonishment was expressed, and
even a great denl of real sympathy excited,
but Marion shrank from tho clamorous ex-
clamations of her young companions, who
eould not so much as guess the measure and
depth of hcr misfortunes. Often had she
shared their sorrows, and willingly would she
have acccpted any oonsolation they could
offier, but the worst of her trials conld not be

her wound, like a stricken deer, into solitude
and silence.
There are insecets that live a life-time in an
hour, and it seemed to Marion as if she had
really done so, sinee the time when sparkling
with gladness, she flew to Mrs Penfold's pre-
sence. Now, heavy with sorrow and anxiety,
she slowly retraced her steps, and on reach-
ing her room, sank upon the bed in a parox-
yem of tears, delivering herself up to many
pasinful thoughts, or rather to her feelings, for
she could not think amidst the tumult of an
agitated mind, when suffering thus under the
most painful of all transitions, from hope t
despair.
It was during the unoccupied half-hour
after dinner, when Mrs Penfold allowed her
pupils a gasp of rest from their labours du-
ring the day, that they gathered in groups at
every window, to critioise a hackney-coaeh
and very tired brokon-down looking horses in
waiting, whilo the pupils all watched for Ma-
rion's departure, anxious to catch a last
glimpse of their favourite compauion. She

while endeavouring to composo her mind,
both of which tasks occupied more timc than

over, and trying to assume an aspect of se-
renity, with pale cheeks nnd swollcn oyes, she
cntered the scehool-room, carrying in her
hand a large and very heavy-looking casket.
The young community crowded round to
say a thousand affectionate farewells, whon,
for a moment, MIarion looked at them all
with her own beautiful smile, but unable to
eontrol hoer emotion, she turned away hcr
head, and burst into an agony of tears.

The bright eyes of Marion were dimmed
with tears of sineerity and emotion, when she
eoneluded; and, placing the casket in Mrs

MIRIo Dunbar being by no means an arrant
novel reader, knew nothing of those artifieial
feelings which too often obliterate the reality.
Simple as a field-flower, her natural sensibi-
lity remain perfectly fresh and unimpaired,
while now, for the first time, experiencing the
withering disappointments, and blighting anx-
ieties of lifte.
As she drove alowly along towards the
sanetuary where Sir Patrick had takon re-

fuge, the most prominent apprehension on
her mind, was that of finding him on the eve
of imprisonment; but she in some degree
eonsoled herself by imagining the services
that in such cireumstanees she might perhaps
be able to do him, and the privations she
could endure for his sake. Tho more proud,
overbearing, and arbitrary, he had hitherta
been, the more touehing it appeared to her
affeetionate spirit, that one who seemed born
to command, should now be so humbled; and
impatiently did she long to prove, that, ho-
ever all things might alter, yet, in prosperity
or adversity, in sickmness or in health, she was
unchangeably the same; while her young
heart glowed with the paramount hope of at
last bocoming useful to her brother, and
therefore weleome.
As she proceeded, visions of deep distress
and difficulty floated dimly through the ind
of Marion, who could not entirely elose her
eyee against tho iron truths, and stern reali-
ties of lifo, while considering how totally un-
suited her brother was, to endure the pri-

vation of a single luxury, and now he eould
scarcely have enough to eommand the most
ordinary neeessarios.
In tho mind of Marion, immediate starva-
tion, and going out as a governess, were the
two ideas that most prominently conneeted
themselves with tho conseiousness of boing
ruined; for hor conception of bankrupty
was of the most terrifying description.
In the few novels she had oor seen, the
heroines could always support themselves by
selling their drawings; but Marion did not
hope to gain an independent livoelihood by
hoar slanting castles, and top-heavy trees,
though taking in plain work, or teaching
music, suggested themselves as possible re-
sourees. Mnrion thought of arrests, bailiffs,

The alow-moving haekney-eoaeh stopped at
last bofore the gate of Sir Patrieck's new resi-
denee, St John's Lodge, a gloomy antiqua
villa near Holyrood House, with gabled win-
dos, astone baleonies, riochly cared balus-
,trades, and pointed roof, surrounded by dusty
beech-trees, and formal yew hedges, i clipped
into fifty unimaginable shapes. Marion was
surprised, on hastily alighting, to perceive the
whole house glittering with lights, and would
have supposed she had made some mistake,

In a tumult of cmotion, Marion, throwing
off' her bonnet, rushed up a broad well-lighted
tlight of stairs, while, wound up to a pitech
of heroism and roantio self-devotion, she
thought only of her brother, impatiently long-
ing to ifly into his arms, and to express the
whole fulness of her affection, and the whole
dcpth of her sympathy. While her heart
sprang forward to meet him, she eagerly
threw open a door next the stairease, and
entered with a hurried and tremulous step;
but suddenly her oeyes were dazzled and be-
wvildered by tho sight which met her agitatel
glanee, while for a moment sho became root-
od to the floor, liko ono who had been stunned
by a sudden blow. Marion gazed without
seeing, and heard without knowing what was
said, so unexpeeted and surprising was the
seene to which she had thus suddenly intro-
duced herself.
A murmur of noise and gayety rang in her
ears, while the whole apartmont was brilliant-

ly illuminated, and the first object which be-
came distinet to her vision was Sir Patriek,
seated at the -head of  superbly-deeorated
dinner-table, in a perfect uproar of merriment
and hilarity. Around him were plaeed five or
six of his gayest associates, dressed in their
scarlet hunting-eoats, and evidently in joyous
spirits, like school-boys during the vaeation,
whilo the whole party presentod a most con-
vivial aspect, laughing in merry ehorus, and
with claret cireulating at full speod round the
hospitable board.
Marion felt as if her feet had lost all powe
of rotion, while, gasping the handle of the
door with one hand, and shading her eyes
with the other, she became transfixed to the
spot. It was a shoek of unexpeected joy, and
while standing in the deep embrasure of
the door, her large eyes dilated, and hen
lips parted, with an expression of speech-
less amazement, she looked like a breath-
ing portrait, which an artist might have
shown as his master-piece,-young, bright,
and graceful, as the first cresecnt of the

The gentlemen all instinetively stood up
with one aceord the moment she appeared,
giving her looks of ombarrassed astonish-
ment and admiration, whilo Marion hastily
retreating, in an agony of confusion, heard
her own voico inadvertently exclaim, `` Pat-

of astonishment more than equal to her own,
while the flowing bumper which had been
raised to his lips remained suspended there,
and in an instant afterwards, his tone of sur-
prise becamoe ehanged into angry imperative
remonstranee. `' MIarion 1 what brought you

Before she had quite retreated, suspecting
the real state of the case, and not wishing for
any public explanation, Sir Patriek added, in
an accent of careless good-humour, `` Agnee

A loud and startling erash at this moment
interrupted Agnes' delightful reminiscences.
Marion instinetively sprang from her seat with
alarm, and looked hastily round, when she
pereeivei that Dixon had tripped ower and
thrown down a table covered with china o-
naments, on whioh Miss Dunbar had frequent-
ly squandered half her income, even at times
when she could searcely afford a dress. The
etiquette being now established that all young
Iadios, of whatever means, shall oultivate a
passion for china and hot-housce plants, Agnes
had made a collection of second-rate vases.,
and third-rate tea-cups, interspersod with
stunted hyacinths and drooping camellias, at
so great an expense that Sir Patrick often re-
commended her to take a wing of the barzaar
and sell off' all her trampery again. The whole
assortment now lay in fragments on the floor,

while Agnes delivered herself up to agonies of
lamentation, seolding, and wondering, over the
ruin of her hoarded treasures, while she point-
ed out with consternation, how nearly the
table had fallen with its edge npon her own
foot, which might have lamed her for lifo.
IThe `` fall of china'' is a proverbial trial of
temper, and that of Agnes did not prove on
this oceeasion invulnerable, while the epithets,
``uwkward wretchl'' and `'atupid idiotI'' were
audibly lavished on tho offending abigail
Marion appeared exelusively oecupied in
gathering up the scattered fragments of china,
and arranging them together, but her eye was
seeretly observing Dixon, the strange wild ex-
pression of whose features filled her with in-
lefinito apprehension. In her countenanee
there gleamed, certainly, for an instant, a dark
smile of malignant satisfaction. Marion felt

exelaimed Agnes, disconsolately, `` How could

``Are you quite certain it proeeeded fromn

watch very carofully, if she did not part with

refreshing to a mind so hackneyed as his, and
though he often clcoked her sensitive spirit
in its full flow of affeetionate confidence, by
a retort courteous, or rather diseourteous, he
was nevertheless vain of the admiration she
invariably excited, and read, in tho eyes of
othors, the value he ought to place on her
beauty and talents.
Agnes' whole mind was so frothed over
with folly, and encrusted with selfishness, that
unless the wheel of fortune touched upon her
personal comforts, she was as impervious to all
externul impressions as a tortoise beneath the
shell, and it was a useless waste of generous
sentiments and kind emotions, whenever the
heart of MIarion was laid open to her. Agnes,
who had long since adopted a eompany man-
ner, and even a company voice, persuaded her-
solf that Marion also, had very oleverly `` got

though the radianece of her intelleet, and the
seneibility of her eye,. were but in harmony
with hor aetions, all testifying disinterested
self-denial and invariable affeotion, astill Agnes
convineed herself that Marion lied `` for
effeet.''
If Marion ever actcd a part at all, it was
only in conecaling from those who might have
ridiculod her, the unfathomable depth of her
feelings, sinee she might as well have askel
for sympathy from an ice-berg as from Agnes.
Knowing that every evideee of aensibility
would be received withsceepticism, she silently
and hopefully waited till some scope might be
afforded her for testifying that all which she
might have wished to profess, was nothing to
what she would do or suffer for those she
loved; and if eer Marion repined at any one
circumstane in her lot, it was, that she might
perhaps pass through life unknown to those
she loved the best, beeause she dured not exs-

saerifice a pleasure, to evince in its full and
heartfelt measure.
One privilege of friendship Marion enjoyed
in unbounded measure with both her brother
and sister. She became tho usual 'depositary
of their many grievanees and disappointments.
Marion had the art,-or rather the instinet,
for to her all art was unknown,-of listening
in perfection. If Agnes received a dress from

Tho annoyance he felt on such oceasions could
scareely be exceeded-the death of his nearest

have been nothing to it; but Marion eould

ingenuity in turning up the bhest side of every-

the very pride and haughtiness of his spirit ren
dered it, in her estimation, the more affeeting
when he seemed at all subdued, and on the
evening of Lady Towerelife's ball, she could
not but faney, before he set off with Agnes,
that there was a foreed vivacity in his spirits
which she had never pereeived before, and
that the tone of his voico had a molaneholy
modulation when he bid her good night, ae-
companied by an unusual degree of kindnose,
always the very worst indiecation of Sir Pa-
triok's spirits, the consciousness of whieh, and
a thousand eonjeetures respeeting its eause
and extent, dismissed her to bed with an anx-
ious mind, and a praycr, even more fervent
than usual, for his happiness.
In one house, Marion was understood and
loved as sho wishod to be, and all her young
enthusiaam found its best refuge and weleome
in the aged heart of Sir Arthur, who felt re-
freshed and cheered by the companionship of

 Ad now, while blonm and breeze their charms unite,
And all is glowing with a rich delight,

The hole air seemed full of incense and
poetry when the light-footed Marion, with a
bounding and elastie step, set forth on her
solitary walk towards Portobello, joyous as a
bird in spring, pleased with thoe whole world.,
and admiring everything with a lightness of
heart that cast its sunshine on all she snw.
Marion delighted in a wild enee of liberty
now, when she contrasted it with her long
yoars of enduranoe at Mrs Penfold's; and
equipped in exactly sueh a pinks gingham
dress as Agnes had censured on Clara Gran-
ville, with the free air, liko liquid sunshine,

und stesped in dew.
Marion had picked some flowers as fresh
and blooming as herself, while she hurried
through the more inhabited parts of the sanc-
tuary, but when passing beneath the palace
windowe, her steps were arrested for a mo-
nent by hearing the sounds of mirth and
musio. `` Can it bet'' thought she, in asto-
nishment, `` Lady Towereliffe's ball is yet at
itse zenith I
Pitying the daneers much more than she
envied them, Marion looked at the scene of
glorious beauty around her, and was hurrying
forwurd, humming a light barcarolle in eon-
cert with the thousand birds in full chorus on
every side, when suddenly a loud shout eaus-
od her to start and turn round. Marion now
pereeived with astonishment that a window
of Lady Towercliffle's apartments had been
haastily opened, and Sir Patriek stood on th
baleony waving his handkercehief impetuously

saw him eagerly running after her aeross the
fields without his hat.
' Marionl you lueky girll stop there''
exelaimed he with breathless animation.

Marion, unable to help laughing at the almost
delirious eagerness of his manner. ` Pray

Uuabloe to resist the out-burst of her bro-
ther's extravagant mirth, yet shrinking and
abashed, almost ready to ery with vexation,
Marion was unwillingly lcd, or almost drag-
gel by her laughing persecutor into the draw-
ing-room, where, with a look of niete, and
an aspeet lovely in the first blush and fresh-
ness of girlhood, she gazed in mute astonish-
ment and almost with dismuy at this her first
peep into the great world of fashion, wishing
for her own part that she could have adopted
invisibility, and enjoyed the seene as if she
were in a private box at the theatre, for as
yet her feelings were `` trop pres de la peine
peur tre un plaisir.''
A bright sunshine streamed into the room,
while the gas lamps still dimly glared over

three or four hot, flushed, dusty-looking
young ladies, with exaggerated colours, soiled
dresses, torn gloves, withered bouquets, and
exeeedingly disordered ringletse, falling in
dishevelled masses over their naked shoulders.
These ladies, assuming foreed spirits, and an
appearance of over-done gayety, kept up a
rattling, flippant dialogue with about twice or
three times the number of gentlemen, some in
glittering uniforms, padded and stuffed to the
very chin, and others in plain clothes, but all
over-heated, over-excited, and over-fatigued,
while, in spite of parched lips and blood-shot
eyes, they were still endeaouring, with all
their might, to be fascinating.
T6 Marion's unaecustomed eye the whole
party seemed like a sot of seeond-rate actors
from the theatre, not calenlated, by their
aspect, to elicit very rapturous applauses, and
she privately wonderod they were not asham-
ed to look each other in the face when in so
ridiculous a plight. Evoen Agnes, her own
beautiful sister, looked very unlike Agnesl

company and not be admiring hcr, but in
Marion's very private opinion, her appearance
was now as if some sign-post painter had
done a resemblanee of her sister in the very
coarsest eolouring, and in the most aver-done
style of dress and expression.
Agnes had a greut deal to say, and no difhi-
dence to provent her saying it all, therofore
she was now plunged into the midst of a very
animatcd dialogue with Captain Do Cres-
pigny, talking with a look of conscious beauty
and conscious sueeess, in the only style she
could talk, nonsense, and making a laish ex-
penditure of smiles, attitudos, and exclama-
tions, to give hersolf the appearaneo of viva-
city. Her hair was in a most disastrous
state, and her complexion everything but
what it should be, while her dress had so
completely fallen off at the shoulders, that she
might appropriately have sung hoer favourite
air, `` One struggle more, and I am freo'

with a start of genuine astonishment, that
Marion was beside her, looking at the mo-
ent like some being of a better world, or
like a graeeful water-lily rearing its pure and
beautiful hend above the turbid pool.
Marion glanced at her sister in a state of
smiling embarrassment, as if dosirous to claim
her proteetion amidst a sceno so new and
strange, and taking possession, with a con-
fiding look, of Agnes' arm, joy seemed rush-
ing out of her bright animated eyes, and
dimpling in her cheek, when, under her
sister's proteetion, she gazed around with an
expression of timid amusement and curiosity.

Agnes felt invariably more astonished at
nuny deficiency of attention, than at the most
devotod assiduity, having accustomed herself
to boliove that she was always tho first object
of intorest to every gentleman in the room,
though diffidenee or caution might cause them
to exercise their self-denial for a timo, by
keeping aloof; and it was with more oom-
misoration for Captain De Crespigny's priva-
tion in losing her, than for her own, that she
accupted the school-boy Peer as a partner,

ludicrous expression of awo and admiration

MIODERN FLIRTATIONS. 388
Captain De Orespigny, after uttering, as
usual, in his most ingratiating manner, a mil-
lion of absurd nothings, took a sentimental
leave of Mnrion, saying, with his very best
smile, and a sigh to eorrespond, `"` I shall al-
ways remember this evening with pleusure-
alwaysl Ten minutes of unmixed happiness
are something in this world to be thankful for
Life has nothing more delightful '
These words were said in his usual gay,
off-hand tone, while Captain De Crespigny
felt perfeetly charmed to think what an im-
pression they must be making on the heart of
his young and unsophisticated partner. He
was at the same time astonished himself, to
find on this occasion how mueh more his heart
was on his lips than it had ever been before.
Marion was the only girl Captain De Cres-
1pigny had yet seen whom he did not feel a wish
to trifle with; for during the last half hour,
he had been not only amused, but deeply in-
terested, by diseovering in her conversation a
degree of matured refleection, of nieete, hu-
uour, and good-sense, aecompanied bya bright-

necss of expression in her deeply-speaking eyes,
mnuch in eontrast with what he had ovor boen
acceustomel to before. Nothing is so rare in
manner as to be perfeetly natural, without a
aovpon of affeetation; and to this charm was
added another, quite as ne and unoxpected
to Captain e Orcspigny, though by no means
so aeceptable, as ho bocame not only asto-
nished, but piqued, at the gay, indifferent
carelessness, with whieh Marion honrd, ae
words of course, not more belonging to her,
than if they had been addressod to any one
olse, his well-turned eompliments and insinu-
ated amiration.
Not to be mct half-way was new and asto-
nishing to Captain De Crospigny? It seemed
perfeetly unaccountable, little as he knew ho
long his character for a ruthless flirt had been
placarded before the eyes of Marion, who no
more eredited the sincerity of his profcssions
now, than if he had been an actor performing
on the stage. She considered that it was his
part for the evening to scatter oivilities indis-
criminatoly around him, while his real feelings
MIoODEHN FLIRTATIONB. 385
were, she believed, privately conseorated to
one, and to one only. Marion's own heart
was in armour, protected by the helief of Cap-
tain De Crespigny bcing her affianced brother;
and therefore she reeeived his adieu with a
uiet demure look, succeeded by an areh smile,
as the idea arossed her mind how completely
she was in the seeret of his attachment, and
how little he seemed to guess that she was.
When Captain De Crespigny observed
Marion's good-humoured careless manner in
taking leave of him, he began to faney it just
possiblo she might still be quite indifferent to
his attentions; but he rather indignantly re-
solved that this should not continue long. It
would be a distinetion, he knew, to follow in
the train of a young beauty so admired as he
saw that Marion must be; for a hundrod
tongues were already talking around him of
her matehless loveliness, while he alone had
yect enjoyed an opportunity of diseovering,
that much as she was to be admired by those
who saw her, she was still more to be loved
by those who knew her; for she seomed to

unite in herself ull tht he had over praised in
a thousand others before, though he carried
no plummet in his mind fitted to measure the
depth of hers. Captain De Crespigny had
been aeeustomed, hitherto, always to feign
more than he felt; but now, for' the first time,
he found it neeessary to coneeal, even from
imself, the cxtent of his feelings; for it
seemed as if the lst few hours had rendered
Mlurion periectly known, and for ever dear to
him. Slowly strolling homewards, thcrefore,
he gave vent to his thoughts, by singing, in a
voice like moonlight, soft and olear, the words
ot a favourite song:-
 nd fare thee well, msy only loel
And f the wIl a wWile
And I will coe again my Iove,
