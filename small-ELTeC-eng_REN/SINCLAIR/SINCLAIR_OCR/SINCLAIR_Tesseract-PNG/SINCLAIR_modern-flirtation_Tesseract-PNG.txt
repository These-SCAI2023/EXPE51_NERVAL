PREFACE.

Unper Prowprer.— Sir, the scene is set, and
everything ready to begin, if you please.”
Crime.

Ir was the rule of a celebrated eques-
trian, which might be adapted to authors
as well as to horsemen, that every one
should ride as if he expected to be
thrown, and drive as if he expected to be
upset. Impunity in publishing, far from
rendering an author presumptuous, should
tend rather to increase his timidity, the
danger being greater always of venturing
too much, than of hazarding too little;
and the more cause any writer has to
feel grateful for the lenient judgment of
an enlightened public, the more circum-
spect should he become, not to trespass

by an obtrusive reappearance on that
notice which has already perhaps been,
as in respect to the author herself, be-
yond all expectation favourable.

An old proverb declares that “a goose-
quill is more powerful than a lion’s claw,”
and authors have been called “ keepers
of the public conscience;” but no influ-
ence is perhaps so extensive as that exer-
cised by what is termed “ light reading,”
which has now in a great measure super-
seded public places and theatrical enter-
tainments, affording a popular resource
with which the busiest men relax their
hard-working minds, and the idlest oc-
cupy their idleness. It becomes a deep
responsibility, therefore, of which the
author trusts she has ever felt duly sensi-
ble, to claim the leisure hours of so
many, while it is her first desire that
whatever be the defects of these pages,
no actual evil may be intermingled, and
the cause of sound religion and morality

supported, for her feelings are best ex-
pressed in the words of the poet,

“If I one soul improve, I have not liv’d in vain.”

Novel-reading, formerly considered the
lowest resource of intellectual vacuity,
has been lately promoted to a new place
in the literary world, since men of the
brightest genius as well as of the highest
attainments in learning and philosophy,
allow their pens occasionally to wander
in the attractive regions of fiction; there-
fore works of imagination, no longer
merely a clandestine amusement to fri-
volous minds, are now avowedly read
and enjoyed, to beguile an idle hour, or
to cheer a gloomy one, by men of science,
of wisdom, and of piety. Such is the
general encouragement given now to
works of fancy, that, as the literary exist-
ence of authors depends on attracting
readers, there will scarcely be encourage-
ment enough soon to induce historians

and biographers to dip the pen of vera-
city into the ink of retrospection, while
it is perhaps to be lamented that when
so large a proportion of the public atten-
tion is occupied by novelists, their works
being certain of instant circulation, for a
very short period and for no more, few
authors afford themselves time to aspire
at the highest grade of imaginary com-
position. When such volumes are really
true to nature, they convey very impor-
tant truths in a form more popular than
a dry sententious volume of moral pre-
cepts, and perhaps history itself can
scarcely afford so graphic a portrait of
human life as many of those fictitious
volumes, written under the inspiration
of genius, which portray in vivid colour-
ing, the thoughts and motives by which
men are internally influenced.

The Life of Cleopatra, or the Memoirs
of Agrippina can afford scarcely so much
direction to young ladies respecting their

PREFACE. vil

views of life and manners in the present
day, as might be conveyed by a judici-
ously-drawn portrait of that world as it
is, on the stage of which they are about
to be personally introduced; and a large
proportion of those elaborate volumes
dignified with the name of history, can
only be considered in the main fictitious,
because, while biographers would confi-
dently state the private opinions, secret
intentions, and real characters: of illustri-
ous men who lived and acted several
hundred years ago, they cannot justly
estimate the actual dispositions and mo-
tives of their own most intimate friends,
nor confidently point out what circum-
stances have influenced the greatest
events in their own day. If two authors,
entertaining opposite political sentiments,
were to write the history of last year,
every fact recorded, and every individual
mentioned must inevitably be represent-
ed, or misrepresented, according to the

 

viii PREFACE.

writer’s own private feelings, while each
would believe he was writing unadulte-
rated truth.

Thus poctry and fiction, when true to
the principles of human life, exhibit the
mind and soul of man visibly to the
senses; and history, which has been call-
ed “the Newgate Calendar of Kings and
Emperors,” supplies the facts of human
existence, and may be considered a por-
trait of men’s persons and external
actions.

In writing a story of domestic life, it
is singular to reflect how commonly men
are remembered by their eccentricities,
and loved for their very faults, while the
most difficult task in fiction is, to de-
scribe amiable persons so as to render
them at all interesting and not utterly
insipid. Probably it may be for this
reason that modern writers too frequent-
ly, instead of describing the principles
which ennoble human nature, and the

PREFACE. ix

sentiments which embellish life, have
painted in vivid colouring, all that is low,
mean, and vicious in society, introducing
their readers into scenes, the reality of
which would be shunned with abhor-
rence, and flinging over vice such a
mantle of genius as converts the defor-
mities of society into subjects of interest,
—unfortunately even of sympathy.

Were authors obliged hereafter, to live
with the characters they create, how few
would desire to share with them in such
a world! Even where the intention is to
represent an attractive character, it sel-
dom appears as one which could be an
agreeable acquisition to any family circle;
and in works of sentiment or feeling, no-
thing is less successfully pictured than a
generous and refined attachment, fitted
to survive every trial or vicissitude of
existence, between those who are to love
and to trust each other for ever. Few
stories could be written, if lovers in a

x PREFACE.

romance acted with the slightest degree
of mutual confidence or esteem; but such
narratives are generally founded on a
teazing succession of narrow-minded sus-
picions and unwarrantable concealments
on the part of heroes and heroines, who
condemn each other unheard, and go
through volumes of heart-breaking alie-
nation, enough to terminate life itself,
rather than ask the most simple explana-
tion, while the reader cannot but feel a
certain conviction in closing the last
page, that an engagement begun with
cavilling jealousies and painful recrimina-
tions, can never become productive of
lasting peace.

The mothers and daughters in fashion-
able society have of late been so harshly
stigmatized by the press, that it seems as
if some authors had taken up a porcu-
pine’s quill dipped in gall, to ridicule
their conduct and motives, while not a
pen has yet been drawn from the scab-

PREFACE. xi

bard, nor a drop of ink spilled in their
justification; but the weight of censure
might become greatly lightened by being
more equitably divided among all who
are entitled to carry a share, and in
these volumes an endeavour is made to
rectify the balance more justly, though
with what success remains to be disco-
vered by the author herself, as not a
single friend ever sees her pages, or puts
on the spectacles of criticism till after
they are printed. The only peculiarity
to which she makes any pretension, in
once more presuming to publish, is, that
avoiding all caricature, all improbability,
and all personality, she has introduced a
few individuals acting and thinking in
the ordinary routine of every-day life,
while her highest ambition is to repre-
sent in natural colours, the conduct and
feelings of men elevated and ennobled by
the influence of Christianity.

When Dr Johnson remarked once that

xii PREFACE,

it required a clever person to talk non-
sense well, Boswell replied, “ Yes, sir!
If you were to represent little fishes
speaking, you would make them talk like
great whales;” and on a similar plan,
authors describing society, instead of
sketching the good-humoured chit-chat
and lively persiflage with which the busi-
ness and amusements of fashionable life
are carried on, too frequently fill up their
dialogues with set speeches, moral essays,
and long quotations, such as never are
extemporized in any drawing-room, where
too energetic a stroke given to the shut-
tlecock of conversation, makes it in-
stantly fall to the ground. The fla-
grant impossibilities by which a careless-
ly-written narrative is carried on, de-
stroys often at once the illusion. Per-
sons are described, who may be overheard
speaking aloud their most seeret thoughts
when supposing themselves alone, solilo-
quizing audibly in the streets, journaliz-

ing a history of their own crimes, becom-
ing permanent guests in houses to which
they have no introduction, preserving the
noblest sentiments amidst the most de-
graded habits, and dying enlightened
Christians when they have lived as dis-
solute infidels.

A celebrated mathematician threw
aside a novel once in disgust, saying that
“it proved nothing,” but in these pages
the author has endeavoured to prove
much. Amidst the bustle and business,
the joys and sorrows of life, she has at-
tempted to illustrate how truly “ wis-
dom’s ways are ways of pleasantness, and
all her paths are peace,’—how superior
is the standard of Christian principle to
the mere worldly code of honour or ex-
pediency, and how much of the happiness
intended for man by his Creator is ruined
and forfeited by the perversity of his own
will, in neglecting the good of others,
and in yainly grasping, like a spoiled

child, at more than is intended for his
share. While thus writing a fiction, which
may perhaps be denominated an enlarged
religious tract in high life, the author
humbly submits her pages to the judg-
ment of others, and cannot conclude in
the words of a more universally venerat-
ed, or of a more generally popular ficti-
tious author than the excellent Bunyan :

« Thus I set pen to paper with delight,
‘And quickly had my thoughts in black and white;
For having now my method by the end, .
Still as I pull’d it eame, and so I penned

It down, until at last it came to be,

For length and breadth, the bigness which you see.”

MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

CHAPTER I.

I would advise a man to pause,
Before he take a wife;

Indeed I own F see no cause
He should not pause for life!

Tue newspapers have recently adopted a
strange habit of sometimes unexpectedly seiz-
ing an individual’s name, long since retired
from public notice, and gibbetting it up before
the world’s eye, when least anticipated, by
volunteering a paragraph to announce, that
some aged lord, or ex-minister, whom no one
has remembered to think of for half a century
or more, is residing on his estates, and enjoy-

ing, the editor is happy to understand, aston-
ishing health, considering his advanced years.
In observance of this custom, an exclamation
of irritability and astonishment, too violent to
be worthy of record, was elicited one day, from
a dignified and very distinguished-looking old
gentleman, with a venerable head, such as
Titian might have painted, and a high lofty
forehead bearing the traces of deep thought
and feeling, when, after having seated himself
on his favourite arm chair at the United Ser-
vice Club in Edinburgh, his eye rested with a
look of kindling amazement on these few lines,
in large consequential-looking type, on a lead-
ing column of the Courant.

June 1829, “We are happy to inform our
readers that the brave and noble veteran, once
a distinguished hero in many a well-fought
fight, Sir Arthur Dunbar, G.C.B., is yet alive,
reposing on his well-earncd laurels, at a retired
mansion in the marine village of Portobello.
Though frequently and most severely wounded
in battle, besides being deprived of an arm in
Lord Rodney’s engagement during the year

°82, the Admiral’s health continues unimpaired
~ and his cheerfulness invariable, at the advanc-
ed age of 70.”

““Pshaw! stuff and nonsense ! Some enemy
is resolved to make a laughing-stock of me in
my old age!” exclaimed he, angrily pointing
out the paragraph to his gay young relative,
Louis de Crespigny, who was familiarly lean-
ing over the high back of his chair; and then
crumpling up the offending Courant with an
obvious wish that it might be consumed in
the flames—“ I hope this is only the work
of some wretched penny-a-liner ; but if I even
suspected that my conceited, good-looking
seoundrel of a nephew had a hand in the jest,
I would cut him off with a shilling,—or rather
without one, for I could scarcely raise so
much as @ shilling to leave him, and he knows
that. This is most thoroughly ridiculous! I,
who have been dead, buried, and forgotten
for years, to be made as conspicuous here, as
a hair-dresser’s wig-block! The editor shall
be prosecuted,—horse-whipped,—or—or made
as absurd as he has made me !”

“ Why really, Admiral, I wish he had as
much good to say of us all, and then the
sooner he paragraphs about me the better !—
‘We are happy to inform our readers, that
the agreeable and. fascinating Cornet De
Crespigny, of the 15th Light Hussars, now in
his eighteenth year, is still alive !'—the public
likes to know the exact age of distinguished

 

men, such as you and I, Admiral !”

“The public is an ass!” replied Sir Arthur,
breaking into a smile; “and perhaps I am
another, to mind what is said at all, but that
rascal of an editor has made me ten years
older than I am; besides which, though a
grey-haired admiral of sixty-four is not proba-
bly much addicted to blushing, he really has
put my modest merit out of countenance. I
would rather pay the newspapers any day for
overlooking than for praising me. We ought
to live or die for our country; but now, when
Tam no longer needed, let me stay in peace
on the shelf, like,” added he, giving a comic
smile at his empty sleeve, “ like a cracked tea-
cup with the handle off!”

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 3

“ But, Sir Arthur!” replied the young Cor-
net warmly, “ you who never turned your back
on friend or foe, are not very likely to remain
quietly on the shelf, as long as every man who
lives must respect you, and every man who
dies continues to appoint you, as my father
did, his executor, the trustee of his estates,
and the guardian of his children, asking you
to lend them a hand, as you have done to me
in all the difficulties of life.”

“T have but one hand to lend, and that is
much at your service, in whatever way it can
be useful! the other, though absent without
leave, has been my own best friend, as the loss
of that arm was the luckiest hit in the world.
It obtained me a step at the time, and the
pension has supported me ever since. What
with my nephew’s frantic extravagance, and
my two young nieces being but indifferently
provided for, I often wish, like every body else,
for a larger income. Poor girls!” added Sir
Arthur, knitting his bushy eye-brows into a
portentous frown, which gave to his venerable
countenance a look of noble and manly sor-

row. “No one can blame them! but it was
little short of insanity in my brother to leave
such young children under the sole guardian-
ship of a heartless spendthrift like your friend
and my nephew Sir Patrick, who would sell
his soul for sixpence.”

“Yes! and squander it the next minute,”
added young De Crespigny, laughing. “ I saw
Pat produce a £20 note yesterday at Tait’s
auction-room, and a buzz of wonder ran all
through the eirele of his friends. Such a sight
had not been seen in his pocket for many a
day, and he threatened to put it up to auction,
saying, he was sure we would all give double
the value for it, as a rarity, considering the
quarter from which it came. He really seems
to pique himself on his poverty, and has the
art of doing what another man would be cut
for, with so much grace and apparent uncon-
sciousness, that his friends really acd to
disapprove.

“J never forget!” replied the Admiral,
slowly rising and adjusting his spectacles. “ I
am even told the incorrigible rascal has mort-

gaged the legacy he pretends to expect from
me! He would do anything short of a high-
way robbery for money, and has done some
things that seem to a man of honour quite as
bad. But,” added Sir Arthur, growing more
and more angry, “ as long as he can give his
friends a good bottle of claret, they ask no
questions! Patrick Dunbar has caused me the
only feeling of shame I ever had occasion for,
and yet to see that proud snuff-the-moon look
of his, you would suppose the world scarcely
big enough to hold him! With his chin in the
air, as I saw him yesterday, he will certainly
knock his forehead some day against the sky!”

“You cannot wonder, Sir Arthur, that
Dunbar is in immense favour with himself,
when he is so admired, and almost idolized in
society. He certainly has the handsomest
countenance in Scotland ;—as my uncle Don-
easter says, Pat is a portrait by Vandyke, in
his best style. With that grand, chivalrous,
Chevalier-Bayard look, he is the best rider
who ever sat on horseback! I could not but
laugh when he mounted yesterday for a ride

along Princes Street, and turned to me, with
his lively, victorious laugh, saying, ‘ Now I am
going to give tle ladies a treat”

“The insufferable coxcomb !” said Sir Ar-
thur, relaxing jnto an irresistible smile of in-
dulgent affection. “From the day he first
came swaggering into this world to astonish
us all, he has thought himself the finest sight
between this and Whitehall !”

“Of course he does! Pat is asked for so
many locks of his hair, by various young la-
dies, that his valet keeps a wig to supply
them; and he might almost pay his debts
with the countless collection he has received
of sentimental rings, displaying forgotten for-
get-me-nots, in turquoises and gold! Who, on
the wide earth, except yourself, Sir Arthur,
would ever dream of finding fault with our
gay, dashing, high-spirited friend, Dunbar, the
life of society, the model of dress, equipage.
and good living. Why! the very instant he
opens his lips, all dulness vanishes like a spec-
tre! I wish the whole world were peopled
with such men ; but he promises to shoot him-

self as soon as he sees his own equal. He
staked his reputation one day that he would !”

‘His reputation! ! the sooner he parts
with it the better! Let Patrick Dunbar ex-
change his own with the first man he meets in
the street, and he will gain by the bargain.”

“Pardon me, there, Sir Arthur, your ne-
phew is universally allowed to be the best fel-
low upon earth !”

“Very probably! the ‘best fellow upon
earth’ generally means a, selfish, extravagant,
seatter-brained roué; but I must be off!
There is a cold, sharp, cutting wind, blowing
in at the back of my neck, which makes me
feel like Charles the First when the axe fell.
If you have any influence, De Crespigny, with
my seape-grace of a nephew—all nephews are
scape-graces, as far as my experience goes—
try to make him more like yourself, and I
shall be grateful, with all my heart.”

“Like me!!!” said the young Cornet, turn-
ing away with a smile; but it was a smile of
bitterness, almost amounting to remorse, while
he hastily grasped a newspaper, and flung

himself into a seat. “No! no! Sir Arthur,
he is not quite so bad as that. Dunbar has
his faults; he wears them upon his sleeve, and
attempts no disguise; but there are many
worse men in the world, who are held up as
examples by those who know no_ better.
Whenever I reform myself, you may depend
upon my lecturing our friend, but not till then.
We must both sow all our wild oats first.”
“Yes! and endure the fruit of them after-
wards,” replied Sir Arthur, with a look of
anxious kindness at his young relative. “That
is the only crop where to sow is more agree-
able than to reap! But I waste words!
‘Young men will be young men, and I might
as well ask this east wind not to blow, or try
to turn the sea from its course, as attempt to
stop the mad career of that scatter-brained
madcap! It would matter less if he only fell
himself hereafter, like a pebble in the stream ;
but the fatal eddy extends in a wide circle,
which must reach the interests of those help-
less young girls, my nieces; and I cannot but
grieve over the consequences which may, and

must befall them, after I go to that rest which
is in the grave, and to that hope which is be-
yond it.”

“ Never trouble your head about what shall
occur then, Sir Arthur! ‘Too much care
once made an old man grey.’ My motto is,
“apres moi le deluge! This little world of ours
got on wonderfully well before we came into
it, and will do astonishingly well again, after
we make our exit,” said young De Crespigny,
with a strange medley in his tone, of melancho-
ly thought, and contemptuous derision. “ Pat
tells me that both my young cousins promise
to turn out a perfect blaze of beauty, with long
shining ringlets that they almost tread upon
in walking, teeth that would make the fortune
of a dentist, and complexions that Rowland’s
kalydor could not improve. Ten years hence,
I shall propose to one or both of them, myself,
if that will give you satisfaction.”

“Perfect! but as marrying two sisters at
once is not quite customary, let your inten-
tions be limited to Agnes- She is several
years the eldest; and I like the good old pa-

triarchal rule of marrying by seniority ; be-
sides which, she is quite a little flirt already,
though scarcely yet in her teens. She will be
a young lady, entirely suited for the ordinary
marrying and giving in marriage of every-day
life ; ‘but little Marion is the very light of my
eyes, and I must match her by a very high
standard indeed. It will be a dark day for
me, if Iam ever obliged to part with her at
all; and being now only in her sixth year, 1
may, without selfishness, hope to keep her be-
side me for my few remaining days. I must
begin match-making for Agnes, however, di-
rectly, and your offer shall be duly considered.
A future peer, with countless thousands in
expectancy, and not particularly ill-looking,
does not fall in our way every morning.”

“So all the young ladies seem to think !”
replied the young Cornet, in his most conceited
tone. “Girls dislike nothing so much as to
marry on a competence; there is a great deal
of romance in marrying on nothing, and a
great deal of comfort in marrying on wealth ;
but a mere vulgar competence has neither ro-

mance nor reality. Now I can offer both!
First, actual starvation on a Cornet’s pay ;
and then, with my uncle’s leave, the pumpkin
will turn to a carriage, and the mice into
horses; but in the mean time, Sir Arthur, Pat
tells me you keep a capital chop-house at Por-

“tobello, so pray invite me to drop in some day

at six, to begin my siege of your pretty niece.
I must come and ‘see, before I can conquer,”
added Mr De Crespigny, in a tone of peculiar
conceit, with which he always spoke either to
ladies or of them. “Probably next week I
may find my way to this terra incognita of
yours. Is it across the Queensferry, or where ?”

“My good friend ! you are not so pre-emi-
nently ignorant of geography as you would
appear ; for did I not see you honouring that
dullest of all dull places, the little obscure vil-
lage of Portobello, with your august presence,
only yesterday. I nearly spitted you on the
point of my umbrella, you hurried so rapidly
Rast, evidently wishing to escape from that girl
iia cloak, who seemed to beset your footsteps!”

“Impossible!!!” exclaimed young De Cres-

pigny, colouring violently, and starting from
his seat. “Could it be in the nature of things
that I should cut you !”

“True enough! I might have said, like
Lady Towereliffe to Prince Meimkoff, ‘cous
a avez coupe.”

“Indeed!” continued the cornet, trying to
conceal his countenance. “I wish you had
eut my throat in return !”

“Tf it is to be done, I would rather some-
body else did! Why, De Orespigny ! you will
set the house on fire with that violent poker
exercise! Your own face is on fire already!
Have more regard for your complexion! Ah!
now it is pale enough! Are you ill? My
dear fellow! what is the matter?”

“Nothing! I am merely looking at the
beautiful sun-set !”

“What! does the sun set in the east to-
night?” asked Sir Arthur, jestingly; “that
is worth looking at !”

“T am annoyed with a spasm of tooth-
ache!” said De Crespigny, putting a handker-
chief to his face, which nearly covered it ; and

then suddenly throwing opal the window, he
looked far out, as if in search of his groom.
He leaned forward so long, however, that Sir
Arthur kindly but vehemently remonstrated
on the danger of exposing himself, while in so
much pain, to the cold air; enumerated a
whole host of remedies for decayed teeth;
suggested the great comfort and convenience
of having the offender extracted by Hutchins,
and ended by hoping his young friend would
still have a tooth left for his proposed dinner
at Portobello.

“Depend upon me for that,” replied Mr
De Crespigny, with forced vivacity. “I shall
ferret you out next week. I have little doubt
your pasture is excellent in that quarter, and
there is no one from whom I should be half
so happy to receive a soup ticket.”

“ Keep your flattery for the ladies, where it
will always be acceptable, and where I hear,
you are already an experienced practitioner
in the arts of captivation. As for my dinner,
I consider it’an imposition to ask any friend,
and not give him the best my cook and cellar

can furnish; and you may expect whenever
you do come, to find a notice over my door,
“hot joints every day !’”

“ But it was the society of your house, and
not the dinner, to which my agreeable antici-
pations were directed ; and there, you know,
Tcannot be disappointed ! as somebody wise-
ly said, when shewn a tempting bill of fare,
‘shew me a bill of the company !’”

“That reminds me to say, you must not ex-
pect my pretty niece to be at my little bath-
ing machine of a house! Tt would not be fair
to inveigle you under such false pretences; but
T promise you an old man’s welcome, and the
best that my cottage can produce; aged as
this newspaper makes me, I enjoy every inch
of life, and hope you, at the same age, will do
the same. I may almost apply to my little
villa that favourite saying in Spain,

«My home, my home! though thou ’rt but small,
‘Thou art to me th’ Escurial.’”

With a cordial shake of the hand, and w
smile of cheerful benignity, Sir Arthur with-
drew, and as his firm and stately step receded,

Mr De Crespigny watched him with a look of
respectful interest, which ended in his turning
away after the admiral had disappeared, and
heaving a deep sigh, while a cloud of care
darkened on his forehead, and a look of angry
yexation shaded his previously animated eyes.

Day after day passed on, subsequent to
the preceding conversation, during’ which Sir
Arthur frequently postponed his chop, to what
he considered an atrociously late hour, in
hopes of his promised guest appearing. Once
the admiral felt positively convinced that he
had seen him enter a Portobello omnibus at
four o'clock, but still he appeared not. Week
after week elapsed, and still Sir Arthur ate
his dinner alone, in long-surviving expectation,
that either his own not very dutiful nephew,
or young De Crespigny, would “ cast up ;” but
at last these hopes and wishes were ended by
his hearing that Sir Patrick’s embarrassments
had caused him to leave Edinburgh by moon-
light, and that, soon after, Mr De Crespigny
as suddenly departed, no one knew why, when,
or wherefore.

CHAPTER II.

 

“ The child is father of the man.”
Worpswormut,

‘Tue two most dashing, bold, and mischievous
boys at Eton during their day, had formerly
been Sir Patrick Dunbar and Louis de Cres-
pigny, who astonished the weak minds of
masters and pupils, by the strange and start-
ling invention displayed in their exploits, as
well as by the ingenuity with which both got
safely out of every threatening predicament,
and the sly humour or cunning with which
they frequently shifted the disgrace, or even
the punishment, of their offences, on others
who deserved it less, or perhaps not at all.
Invariably at the head of every mad exploit,

or at the bottom of every secret design, how
they could possibly have eseaped being ex-
pelled was a frequent topic of subsequent
wonder among their contemporaries in the
classes; but their delight was to run as near
the wind as possible, and still to display their
skilful pilotage by baffling justice, and evading
the utmost rigour of the law, while always
ready rather to do harm than to do nothing.
When very young, the two enterprising
friends, both since gazetted into the 15th
Light Huzzars, had shewn an early predilection
for military life, by frequently escaping to the
neighbouring barracks, assisted by a ladder
of rope on which they descended every night
from the windows. A gay joyous reception
invariably awaited these lively boys at the
mess-table, where they sung many a jovial
song, and cracked many a merry jest over
their claret, till, after some hours spent in
rapturous festivity, they stole silently back
within bounds, and were re-admitted at the
window, by their respective fags, who had re-
ceived orders, under pain of death, to keep

awake and answer their signals for the ladder
by instantly lowering it. The spirits of both
these young companions were more like the
effect of intoxication, than mere sober enjoy-
ment; and, on one occasion, they set the
table in a roar, by having a rivalship which
would best imitate the gradual progress of
becoming tipsy, though drinking nothing but
cold water; in which exhibition they showed so
much talent for mimicry, taking off the sur-
rounding officers before their faces, and mak-
ing so many home-thrusts and personal re-
marks, that the scene was never afterwards
forgotten in the regiment. On another occa-
sion Sir Patrick caused himself to be placed
in a coffin, stolen from the undertakers, and
was carried through the barracks by his com-
panions, who made paper trumpets with which
they played the dead march in Saul, while all
the sentries saluted as they passed. Such
juvenile exploits in the dawn of life were now
the subject of many a laughing reminiscence,
“and had been followed by others on a more
extended scale and of more matured enter-

prise, at Mr Brownlow’s, a private tutor,
where the two young men afterwards distin-
guished themselves in a way not easily to be
forgotten, causing their better disciplined
companions to wonder, though in very few in-
stances to admire.

In the favourite aristocratic achievements
of driving stage coaches, breaking lamps,
wringing off knockers, assaulting watchmen,
with other fistic and pugilistic exploits, they
were nearly unrivalled; and occasionally their
genius had soared into an extraordinary dis-
play of dexterity, in transposing the signs sus-
pended over shops, and in filehing silk hand-
kerchiefs from the pockets of their friends,
merely as amateurs, but still the deed was
done, and the laugh raised literally at the ex-
pense of the sufferer, as the plunder was re-
tained to be a future trophy of success. Each
successive stage of their youth, in short, sup-
plied an inexhaustible fund of standing jests
and lively anecdotes, the wit of which mainly
consisted in their mischief, while they betray-
ed an utter recklessness about the opinions or

the feelings of others, till at length the pati-
ence of their unfortunate private tutor was so
completely exhausted that he gave them a
secret hint to withdraw, which they accord-
ingly lost no time in preparing to do, but not
till they had enjoyed a very characteristic
revenge. When Mr Brownlow had taken a
party of friends with him one evening to the
theatre, Sir Patrick suddenly discharged from
the gallery the whole contents of a prodigious
bag of flour, which powdered all the heads,
faces, and coats, in the pit, perfectly white,
and caused an uproar of anger and of irresis-
tible laughter throughout the house; and the
same evening Louis de Crespigny, as a fare-
well frolic, abstracted a stuffed bear from the
neighbouring hair-dresser’s, and having equip-
ped it in the costume of Mr Brownlow, hung it
from the lamp-post, where a panic-struck crowd
was speedily assembled by the alarming report
that the reverend gentleman had committed
suicide. A strict investigation took place re-
specting the authors of these unpardonable
tricks, but, though suspicion fell at once upon

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 23

the real culprits, and the circumstantial evi-
dence against them seemed irresistibly strong,
Sir Patrick argued his own cause with so
much skill and vivaeity, while De Crespigny
looked so innocently unconscious of the whole
affair, that, with a silent frown from the mas-
ter, of stern reproof and suspicion, they were,
not honourably acquitted, but allowed to re-
turn home without any public mark of cen-
sure or disgrace; and soon after both joined
their regiment at Dublin.

De Crespigny and Sir Patrick had but one
companion whom they acknowledged as their
equal at Eton, in all the spirit, enterprise, and
vivacity of their characters, but who was, in a
thousand other respects, their superior, for
seldom, indeed, has there been known, in one
so young, a character of as much intensity, or
which displayed a combination so singular, of
superb talents, rare judgment, sound prin-
ciple, deep piety, and energetic feeling, as
in Richard Granville, an object of admira-
tion to all, and of envy to many; though
jealousy lost half of its bitterness in asso-

ciation with one so eloquent and single-heart-
ed in conversation, so courteously amiable
and conciliatory in manner, and with so
fine a principle of tact, ready as far as pos-
sible to enhance the pleasures, to palliate the
faults, and to share the sorrows of all his com-
panions. Cultivated in all that could adorn
the heart, as well as the head, in whatever
was amiable, high-spirited, and generous, Rich-
ard Granville had but to follow the impulse of
natural feeling as well as of principle, and he
out-did the very wishes of his friends, while no
one excelled him in all the manly exercises
suited to his early years. His countenance
was illuminated with an expression of intellec-
tual energy, at times almost sublime, while
there was a living grace and amiability in his
manner irresistibly attractive. Brave, liberal,
and resolute, he entered with eagerness into
all the inoffensive recreations of his compa-
nions, and no one excelled him in riding,
fencing, and cricket, while he was the best
shot in his own county; but he firmly de-

clined ever to squander his time or money on

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 25

any games of chance, cards, billiards, or gam-
bling in any form. While Sir Patrick’s bet-
ting-book was from the first a model of skill,
in hedging bets, and all the mancuvres of
jockey-ology, young Granville said all that
eloquence and affection could dictate, to point
out how dangerous and dishonourable was the
course on which he seemed about to enter,
but in vain, for Sir Patrick finished the dis-
cussion by offering to bet him L.5 he would
not be ruined in less than ten years. “I have
a fortune and constitution which will last me
till thirty,” said the young baronet; “ and I
do not wish to live a day longer.”

“Tt is easy,” said Prince Eugene, “to be
modest when one is successful, but it is difficult
not to be envied.” While the very presence of
young Granville in the room with’ his riotous
young associates, seemed as if it held up a
glass to their mind’s eye, testifying the folly
and evil of their course, yet Richard Granville
abhorred display, while Sir Patrick and De
Crespigny frequently declared he was “ too

clever and too good for them ;” and unavoid-

able circumstances afterwards combined to
estrange the young men still more. A law-
suit had been going on almost since the period
of their birth, conducted in an amicable way
by their guardians, in which the interests of
all three were so deeply concerned, and the
ease so exceedingly complicated, that years
passed on, during which the youths had all
grown to manhood, and the case remained
still undecided; while the one-sided view
which was given to Dunbar and De Crespigny
on the subject caused in them an angry feel-
ing of rancour and hostility against their ami-
able and high-minded young relative, who was
so enthusiastically desirous to enter the Eng-
lish church, and devote himself to those sacred
duties, that he scarcely wished a favourable
decree, which would prevent the necessity for
his pursuing a profession at all.

A Scotch law-suit may be compared to a
game at battle-dore between the tribunals
of England and Scotland, while the gaping
client sees the shuttle-cock for ever flying
over his head, higher and higher out of reach,

and sent backwards and forwards with cease-
less diligence, but no apparent progress; or
it is like a kitten playing with a ball of
worsted, which is allowed to come often ap-
parently within her grasp, and is then, when
she least expects, twitched away farther than
before. The Granville case had been decided
by the Court of Session, against the two cou-
sins, Dunbar and De Crespigny, but being ap-
pealed to the House of Lords, was recom-
mended for consideration, re-argued, re-consi-
dered, and nearly reversed, while replies and
duplies, remits and re-revisals, commissions of
inquiry, and new cases, followed each other in
ceaseless succession, and many.of the lawyers
who were young men when the case began,
grew grey in the service, while yet it remained
in suspense. A grand-uncle of Sir Patrick’s
had fifty years before bought an estate of
L.12,000 a-year from the Marquis of Doncas-
ter, to whom young De Crespigny was now
heir-presumptive; but Mr Dunbar having, it
was conjectured, entertained some suspicion
that the title-deeds were not perfectly valid,

as an entail had been discovered afterwards,
by which it was generally thought that the
land must be restored to the original owner,
he hastily and most unfairly sold the property
to the late Mr Granville for L.350,000, and
dying intestate, after having lost nearly the
whole sum in a mining speculation, it could
not be proved whether Sir Patrick’s father
had acted as executor for the deceased or not,
so as to render himself responsible for his
debts, and liable to refund the sum paid by
Mr Granville. Thus, whether the entail held
good, and carried the estate back to Lord
Doncaster, or whether it had been legally
broken, so as to entitle the Granville family
to keep it, or whether, if it were refunded, the
price could be claimed from the heirs of Mr
Dunbar, still continued a mystery never ap-
parently to be solved.

For many generations past, the ancient
Marquisate of Doncaster had been inherited
by a succession of only sons, all strict Papists,
who had each in his turn been reckoned by
the next heirs exceedingly sickly and unpro-

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 29)

© mising, but still the wonder grew, for not one

had ever died, till he left a substitute in regu-
lar rotation, to supply the vacaney which he
created himself; and a long train of minorities
in the family had caused the accumulation of
wealth and property to be enormous, when
the present proprietor succeeded, fifty years
before our story commences. Nothing could
exceed his own astonishment at the unembar-
rassed magnificence of the fortune, of which
he most unexpectedly found himself in pos-
session, as his father had been in the habit:
of concealing the amount of liis own income,
and allowing his heir rather less than nothing,
saying, that as he himself never had anything
to eat till he had no teeth to eat with, he was
resolved that his successor should be similarly
treated. In pursuance of this plan, the old
nobleman even on his death-bed, had actually
expired with a practical joke on his lips. He
sent for his son, gravely told him that with
debts, mortgages, and settlements, the very
encumbered estate he was about to inherit
would scarcely pay its own expenses, and re-

commended him to live in future with the
most penurious economy. When the will was
opened, finding to his unutterable joy, that he
had merely been played upon by the old hu-
morist, who in reality left him L.40,000 per an-
num clear, so great was Lord Doneaster’s sur-
prise, that he declared his good fortune at the
time to be “ almost incredible ;” and it might
have been supposed, that he never afterwards
completely believed it, as his personal expenses
were always in a style more suited to the old
Lord’s threat than his performance, and he
became a fresh instance of what may be so of-
ten remarked, that the most extravagant heirs
in expectancy become the most avaricious in
possession.

There was one singular peculiarity in the
settlements of Lord Doncaster’s family, that
so long as he had no son, or if his son at
twenty-one declared himself a Protestant, he
had the power of selling or bequeathing the
estates according to his own pleasure or ca-
price; and the ancestor who had inserted this
clause in his deed of entail, made his intention

evident, that the succession should go to the
Roman Catholic Chureh, rather than to a Pro-
testant heir; but the present peer had taken
advantage, on so large a scale, of his own
childless privilege, to sell the family estates,
that his two deceased sisters, Lady Charlotte
De Crespigny, and Lady Caroline Smytheson,
used secretly to complain, that little would be
left for their children, if he persevered in
turning every acre into gold; yet no one ever
could guess how the large sums were squan-
dered or melted away, which the old Marquis
was continually raising, unless they went,
as was strongly suspected, in the form of
“ secret service money,” among the priests by
whom he was surrounded.

Nobody had a better right to be eccentric
than Lord Doncaster !—old, rich, unmarried,
and originally educated at home,—a misfor-
tune sufficient in itself to engender so many
peculiarities, as to render a man unfit for so-
ciety ever afterwards. The aged peer was
shy, proud, and arbitrary beyond all con-
ception, avaricious about trifles, yet lavish to

excess on great occasions, suspicious of all
men’s motives and intentions, and yet con-
fiding to the last extreme of weakness, in the
Abbé Mordaunt, his confessor, despising all
men, and yet anxious beyond measure for the
world’s good opinion, addicted to the very
worst female society, when he might have
enjoyed the best, hating company, and yet
sometimes plunging into it, when and where
he was least expected, jealous to excess of
his next heir, Louis De Crespigny, whom he
enslaved to his caprices, as if even his exist-
ence were to be given or withheld at his
option, yet sometimes whimsically cordial in
his manner to him, though ready to take fire
in an instant if his condescension led the live-
ly youth into the slightest approach towards
confidence or familiarity.

Mr Howard Smytheson, the wealthy bro-
ther-in-law of Lord Doncaster, having pur-
chased most of the De Crespigny estates, as
acre after acre, farm after farm, and house
after house, came successively into the mar-
ket, bequeathed them on his decease to an

only daughter then an infant, and it became
a favourite day-dream with the old peer, that
his nephew and niece should be educated for
each other, while to this end he tried his ut-
most power of conciliation with the maiden
sister of Mr Howard Smytheson, to whose
care the young heiress had been consigned,
hoping that thus all the amputated limbs of
his vast property might yet be reunited in
their pristine magnitude, to which very de-
sirable end he thenceforth directed his whole
conversations with young De Crespigny, to
whom he more than hinted that, unless their
will were the same about this marriage, his
own will after death would be found very dif-
ferent from what his nephew probably antici-
pated and wished.

The private vices of Lord Doncaster had
been so very private, that though much was
suspected, little could be known; yet, while he
had few visible or personal expenses, and no
imaginable outlet for his fortune, he invariably
spent all his income, and considerably more,
being one of those personages occasionally seen

who excite the wonder and speculation of rela-
tions and neighbours, by unaccountably frit-
tering away fortunes of almost royal splendour,
without any appearance of royal luxury or royal
liberality. Wearied of the world, in which he
had nothing more to desire, and of himself, as
he had nothing to think of or to do,—bored in
short with the want of a want, Lord Doncas-
ter’s life was indeed a mere heartless pageant
of mean ostentation and fretful pride, sternly
insulated in a state of solitary old-bachelor
despotism, and absorbed in himself to a degree
which no ordinary mind could conceive or
comprehend. Encumbered with so many un-
occupied hours, it was a subject of as much
wonder how he disposed of his superfluous
time, as of his superfluous fortune; but he set-
tled that question, by remarking one day to
his nephew, that “ the great business of life
is, to shuffle through the day anyhow till din-
ner time.” Like all parsimonious men, Lord
Doncaster could not endure to hear any one
else reckoned affluent, and Louis De Crespigny
knew that a certain receipt for irritating him

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 35

was, to over-estimate everybody's income, con-
sequently he amused himself occasionally by
audibly giving out Lord Towercliffe’s fortune
to be L.15,000 a-year, and estimating his friend
Sir Patrick Dunbar’s rent-roll at a clear sum
of L.20,000 per annum, while he slyly watched
his unele’s rising choler, and patiently heard,
for the fiftieth time, an elaborate explanation,
that it was impossible, and a sober calculation,
which reduced both the offending parties almost
to beggary.

In the month of August, as regularly as time
revolved, Lord Doncaster delighted to read in
the newspapers, his own pompous advertise-
ment, the only original composition he was ever
known to attempt, in which he prohibited
poachers and strangers from shooting on his
moors in Argyleshire, Mid-Lothian, Yorkshire,
Galloway, Cromarty, and Caithness, but except
the annual appearance of this spirited mani-
festo, no publie evidence ever came forth of
that extraordinary wealth which property so
extensive must be supposed to produce. - No
charitable donations bore witness to Lord Don-

caster’s liberality,—no country objects were
encouraged by his public spirit,—and the mo-
numents daily arising in memory of departed
merit, made a vain appeal for his pecuniary
tribute of respect and regret, for Lord Doncas-
ter neither respected nor regretted any man.

It was an often-repeated axiom of Lord Don-
caster’s, that every man cheats or is cheated;
but in one instance, and one only, his Lordship
had shown apparently some kind feeling, or
rather perhaps he might be said to have exhi-
bited a capricious freak of benevolence, though
the result had been such as to afford him an
excuse ever afterwards for not again attempt-
ing a single act of gratuitous liberality.

The nearest relative to his ancient family, af-
ter Louis De Crespigny and Miss Howard, was
Mrs Anstruther, a distant cousin, who, after
making a low and almost disgraceful marriage,
had suddenly died, it was believed by her own
hands, thus consigning her two young ehildren
to helpless, and apparently hopeless poverty,
till at length they were very unwillingly invited,
or rather permitted to become residents in an

almost menial capacity at Beanjolie Castle, in
Yorkshire, where, as they could neither be
drowned like kittens, nor shot like puppy-dogs,
the Marquis caused them to be treated like
the “ whipping boys” in Charles the First’s
time,—sometimes employed as playmates to
amuse his nephew and niece during their holi-
day visits to his residence, but more frequently
treated in a sort of .mongrel-way between de-
pendents and slaves by, the heartless and
tyrannical old peer, who considered them as
mere poachers on the preserve of his family
honours, having forced their way into exist-
ence by some untoward accident, and become
absolute blots in the creation, liable to be
suspected, and even accused to their faces of
every low and vicious propensity, in conse-
quence of which, from an early age, he destroy-
ed their self-respect, and irritated their evil
passions by the most rash and unfounded
aspersions,—theft, swindling, lying, and glut-
tony, were among the principal counts in his
Lordship’s indictment, when he sometimes
vented a paroxysm of ill-humour on these his

38 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

unhappy dependents; and many a time the
tears of Mary Anstruther, and the flashing eye
of her brother Ernest, bore witness to the
anger and grief with which they listened to
his bitter and often unmerited upbraidings.
At times, however, Lord Doncaster found it
convenient for his own private purposes to pa-
tronize the Anstruthers, and threatened, in the
hearing of all his young relatives, that if Louis
De Crespigny’s conduct did not in all respects
satisfy him, an heir more subservient to his
wishes might be found, and though the culprit
must be his nephew, he need not be his succes-
sor, while the glance of his eye towards Ernest
aroused hopes, wishes, and even expectations
of the wildest extravagance, which were then
confirmed for a time by his being promoted
to temporary attention and consideration, not
only displayed ostentatiously by their caprici-
ous patron, but extending to the increased re-
spect and observance of the servants, the
thermometer of whose obedience rose and fell
according as the sunshine of Lord Doncaster’s
favour shone upon his young relative or not;

\
MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 39

yet brief as these periods of increased import-
ance had always been, they made an indelible
impression on the young and ambitious minds
of those usually neglected children. “ The
child becomes a boy, the boy a youth, and
then the game of life begins in earnest.”

Without education or principle, and with
no friend on the wide earth to confide in or to
consult, the two young Anstruthers, like weeds
that will yet flourish though trampled upon,
grew up Vigorous in body, and enthusiastically
as well as devotedly attached to each other,
with a depth and power of affection which ap-
peared, before long, the only redeeming qua-
lity in characters wherein strong passions and
weak principles promised little, and threat-
ened much, to all with whom they might
hereafter become associated.

The resemblance between them was as re-
markable as their attachment, both having
dark Italian-looking countenances, of remark-
able symmetry, with a singularly excitable and
determined expression in their large lustrous
eyes, while it was remarkable that neither

40 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

could by possibility look any one steadily in
the face. There was a wild, almost feverish
brillancy in the eye of Ernest, expressive of a
fiery impetuosity, amounting at times almost
to an appearance of insanity, when, after be-
ing obliged to crouch and flatter for his bread
before Lord Doncaster, he would retire with
Mary, and give loose to all the angry torrent
of his long-suppressed emotions. The sister's
heart cowered sometimes before the flood of
invectives and imprecations with which he re-
lieved his heart by speaking of his wrongs,
while he seemed to cherish a gnawing belief
that fortune herself had shown him a most
unaccountable and undeserved enmity, which
he was resolved, by fair or by foul means, to
subvert. “I shall yet rise above all the acci-
dents of fortune! It shall be done, I care not
how, Mary,” said he sternly.‘ We must not
be over-particular on that score, for, as the
proverb says, ‘a cat in mittens will never
catch mice !"”

Bold, fearless, and ready, with a keen appe-
tite for danger, a fearless ambition, consummate

 

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 41

cunning, and an insatiable thirst for adventure,
it seemed sometimes as if he would put his
mind into a pugilistic attitude, and buffet his
way forward to pre-eminence in spite of all the
malice of fortune and of mankind. With a
temper vindictive, harsh, and deadly, his blood
mounted like mereury in a thermometer at the
very thought of success, and often when he
spoke to his sister in the lowest whisper of
their future prospects, she would start and
look hastily round as if in terror, lest the wild
dreams of his undisciplined mind might be
overheard and resented, for he nourished a
feverish hope, which he called a presentiment,
but which amounted almost to a mono-mania,
that the splendid residence in which they were
now only tolerated on sufferance, “ as reptile
dependents,” would one day become his own.
If every man living might remove at plea-
sure all those who stand inconveniently in his
way, political economists would have nothing
to fear from a too rapidly increasing popula-
tion, and the day-dreams of Ernest, which
gained strength and consistency every hour,

42 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

were prolific in both deaths and marriages.
He carefully collected in the Peerage all the
instances there recorded, in which distant re-
lations had succeeded through a long morta-
lity of twenty or five-and-twenty intermediate
heirs,—he remembered that neither Louis nor
Caroline had yet endured the measles,—he
thought their Shetland ponies very dangerous,
and, in short, if their days had been measured
by him, the measure would have been short
indeed. His personal vanity was excessive,
and amidst his wild schemes of aggran-
disement, the first and foremost had lately
been to marry his lively, frolicsome, little cou-
sin, and occasional play-mate, Caroline How-
ard Smytheson, in whose infant manner, heed-
less and good-humoured as she was, he flat-
tered himself there might be traced an evident,
appearance of preference, while he could not
but also remark, that before any of the young
party had attained the age of maturity, and
Caroline was yet a mere infant, Louis De
Crespigny had already begun to exercise his
genius for flirtation in the society of his hum-

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 43

ble cousin Mary Anstruther,—humble only in
circumstances, but possessing that pride with-
out principle, which goes before a fall.

Time had ripened the faults of the two
young Anstruthers, and perfected also their
extraordinary beauty of person, when, after
Ernest had attained the age of nineteen, a
whim as sudden, and apparently as unaccount-
able as their adoption, caused Lord Doncaster,
or rather the Abbé Mordaunt, unexpectedly
to announce that they were dismissed from
the house. Various rumours were circulated
among the servants to account for this harsh
and hasty decision, but nothing could be dis-
eovered for certain. Ernest was reported to
have expressed himself with the greatest ran-
cour and contempt respecting a report in cir-
culation, that Lord Doncaster intended to
marry the Abbé Mordaunt’s beautiful niece,
then on a visit at Kilmarnock Abbey, near
Edinburgh. The Abbé was said to have miss-
ed some valuable jewels belonging to his niece
Laura, who accused both the Anstruthers of
having been seen in her room,—a large sum of

44 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

money, it was hinted, had mysteriously disap-
peared—some people said that Ernest had been
discovered at a late hour of the night attempt-
ing to enter the sleeping apartment of Lord
Doneaster, without being able to give any sa-
tisfactory account of his intentions, and others
declared that Louis De Crespigny’s assiduities
to Mary Anstruther had recently become ra-
ther too obvious, while surmises arose against
her character; but whatever might be the
eause, they were both hastily transferred on a
few hours’ notice from the splendours of Kil-
marnock Abbey, to a small obseure lodging at
Portobello. As Ernest was about to leave
that house which had so long been his home,
with Mary sobbing in uncontrollable grief on
his arm, anger and despair were fearfully
stamped on their young faces, when the Abbé
Mordaunt advancing silently, placed a small
sum of money in their hands, which the young
man furiously dashed upon the ground, and
trampled upon, saying in accents of strong and
almost terrifying vehemence, while his counte-
nance exhibited a dark insidious expression of

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 45

almost maniacal fury, “ I would not be hu-
man if I did not hate your niece and you !—
my curse shall rest on both till I amrevenged!
Take back your paltry gold, I shall build up
my own fortune, or perish in the ruins! I shall

 

live by my own hands, or,
hands I shall die!”

From that day forward the names of Mary
and Ernest Anstruther never passed the lips
of Lord Doncaster or the Abbé, who ordered
the servants also to abstain from ever men-

by my own

tioning them, which only piqued the curiosity
of the second table into greater activity than
ever; but though many vague conjectures,
dark suspicions, and absurd rumours, were
promulgated throughout the establishment,
nothing certain could be ascertained, except
that they returned no more to Kilmarnock
Abbey, and that a final extinguisher had been
placed on all their prospects and hopes from
Lord Doncaster.

About this time Mrs Bridget Smytheson
sent Miss Howard, then only six years old, to
school, and seemed so little anxious to encou-

rage an intimacy between the young heiress
and Louis de Crespigny, whom she had long
disliked, that Lord Doncaster, piqued and in-
dignant, angrily reminded her of his sister
Lady Caroline’s dying injunetion, to which she
had promised implicit attention, that if the
cousins, after they were grown up, could be
ascertained to have a disinterested preference
for each other, every opportunity should be
given them to become attached and engaged.
“ Certainly, Lord Doncaster; and I shall
fulfil my pledge,” replied the over-dressed,
and rather under-bred aunt, in her usual tone
of fantastic affectation; “ but these boy-and-
girl intimacies are not the most likely to pro-
duce that romantic love with which young
people ought to begin their married lives; and
besides, how could their preference be disin-
terested, where the brilliant prospects of both
are continually descanted on as motives to
their union. No! I have a considerable spice
of romance in my composition ; and when they
do mect again, it shall be under very different

circumstances.”

“ What a creature to have the charge of
any girl!” thought Lord Doncaster, as he re-
turned from handing her, with every appear-
ance of profound respect, into her poney-car-
riage. “ There is not another woman half so
insane out of bedlam; and that mad-cap child
herself is as wild as a horse with the reins
broke. The greatest annoyance on earth is,

“ to have rich and vulgar upstarts among one’s
near connections.”

CHAPTER III.

‘The exalted portion of the pain
And power of love I cannot share-—Byrov.

Tue life of Louis De Crespigny, from the
hour he entered the army, was one continued
steeple-chase after pleasure and amusement,
in whatever form they could be courted, or at
whatever expense they could be enjoyed. At
a very early age, he was already a veteran in
the world and its ways; for he stood “ alone
in his glory,” the most admired, courted, and
idolized of mankind, a perfect adept in all the
arts of rendering himself agreeable in society,
and possessing many pleasant qualities, but
none that were valuable. During a gay career
of dissipation and frivolity, he had entered

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 49

with successive eagerness on a thousand flirta-
tions, though he always forgot to marry in the
end, while his heart, like a phoenix, was fre-
quently consumed, yet never destroyed, and
always ready at the service of any young lady,
with youth, beauty, and accomplishments
enough to excite his temporary interest. Being
of opinion, that, though not yet a peer, he
ought speedily to be one, young De Crespigny
openly avowed the impossibility of marrying
while Lord Doncaster survived, and jocularly
remarked, that it would be a pity prematurely
to cut off the hopes of his hundred and one
Scotch cousins, who lived, like Ernest An-
struther, on the hope, that if his neck were
broken at Melton, his succession might yet be
“ cut up” amongst them; and to the friendly
inquiries of his many relatives, he frequently
replied with a condoling look, that he and his
uncle were both “ hopelessly well.”

Lord Doncaster was not even yet, by any
means, so great a Methusalemite in age, nor
so weighed down with infirmities, as his lively

nephew chose among the mothers and daugh-
ters of his intimate acquaintance to represent ;
and some ladies whom young De Crespigny
had piqued or affronted, were actually ill-na-
tured enough to hint, that Lord Doncaster
was still almost young and almost handsome !
They had even been so malicious as to insi-
nuate, that his Lordship might possibly have
a genius for marrying his housekeeper, almost
the only respectable female who ever crossed
his threshold; but Mrs Frieland’s very ma-
ture age, and very antiquated dress, shewed
how completely she must have given up that
point; and even her desire to please him in
her own department, became every hour so
increasingly difficult, and was attended. with
failures and disappointments so unforeseen
and unaccountable, that the good woman often
shook her head ominously, in alluding to his
Lordship’s numerous whims, saying, in a con-
fidential under tone, which seemed to mean
more than met the ear, to the steward, “ he’s
petiklar! he’s very petiklar! It would require

a

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 51

a person bespoke to order to please his Lord-
ship.” And cortainly he had become of late
years more particular than ever.

One personage only seemed to have the art
of doing no wrong in the estimation of Lord
Doncaster ; and the respect which he withheld
from all mankind, was concentrated to an im-
measurable degree on the Abbé Mordaunt,
who was the Cardinal Wolsey of Kilmarnock
Abbey and Beaujolic Castle. Proud, over-
bearing, harsh, and arbitrary, he ruled over
the house, the purse, and even the will of his
patron, with despotic and unlimited sway. Men
are generally advanced in years before the
passions and feelings have stamped their in-
delible traces, like the impression of a seal,
which becomes permanent only after the wax
has begun to cool; but in every feature of the
Abbé’s countenance, might now be scen the
evidences of a gloomy, severe, and almost fero-
cious temper, yet never was there a greater
triumph of art over nature, than in the skill
with which he adapted his looks and conyersa-
tion to the taste or caprice of those whom it

52 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

was his interest to govern, and the astonishing
facility with which he could call up a bland
smile and insinuating voice, to supersede the
habitual haughtiness of his tone and manner.

Edueated at St Omers, in all the dark su-
perstitions of that bigoted college, the Abbé
was nevertheless far from desiring to seek
within the walls of a cloister any protection
from those temptations to worldly indulgence,
which he had not even a wish to resist. He
neither preached nor practised the virtues of
his vocation, but paraded a whole troop of
vices openly in the public eye; and far from
seeking to reform mankind, he never attempt-
ed even to reform himself. Though in perso-
nal appearance of distinguished ugliness, yet
such was the magic of his manner, that even
by ladies he was considered perfectly irre-
sistible; and to all, whether old or young, he
generally succeeded in imparting a conviction,
that he saw in her, for the first time, a realiza-
tion of female perfection and female fascina-
tion. The Abbé was never known to stop
half-way in arduously pursuing any object of

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 53

pleasure, profit, or ambition, nor, whatever
might be the impediments, was he ever seen
to fail of success; for, like Bonaparte, he did
not know the meaning of the word “ impos-
sible.”

After having recklessly squandered, in a
career of almost startling dissipation, the whole
of his own patrimony, it was believed that he
had obtained fraudulent possession of £10,000
belonging to his very beautiful niece, to whom
he must have refunded it had she lived to come
of age, or had she married it must have been
restored to her children, but about the time
our story commefices, she was supposed either
to have died, or to have retired to a convent
abroad, though whether upon conviction or
not, might be considered very doubtful, as she
had been educated by her mother in the Pro-
testant faith, and it was generally conjectured
that to so sudden and entire a removal from
all former connections, her poverty more than
her will must have consented. Laura Mor-
daunt had resided much at Kilmarnock Abbey
with her uncle, to whom she seemed warmly

BA MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

and blindly attached, but the gossiping world
sometimes conjectured that perhaps the evident
partiality and admiration of Lord Doncaster
might have roused in her some ambitious
thoughts, backed by the influence of the Abbé.
Among the peculiarities of the Marquis he
had always professed a decided contempt for
all respectable ladies, and therefore his atten-
tions to Laura Mordaunt were at best a very
questionable compliment, and became latterly
of a nature which few relatives would have
wished to encourage, yet Miss Mordaunt still
remained a guest at Kilmarnock Abbey, till the
period of her sudden disappearance, which
caused so much astonishment among her inti-
mate friends and near connections, that the fa-
ther of Richard Granville, her cousin, shortly
before his own death, wrote an affectionate let-
ter, entreating her to return, were it but for a
few months, and to make a home of his house
for the future, should it suit her to do so; but
to this kind and generous offer no reply ever
came, and as all communications were to pass
through the Abbé’s hands, who alone knew

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 55

his niece’s direction, it might be doubted whe-
ther the invitation ever reached that hand for
- which it was intended.

That Lord Doncaster had cruelly disappointed.
Laura Mordaunt, as he had already disappoint-
ed many others, her friend and cousin had good
reason to believe; and though unable to ima-
gine any really romantic or lasting attachment
to a man, however elevated in rank or agree-
able in manners, of at least fifty years old, yet
_he knew that Laura, who lived so retired that
she could boast of few friends and no admirers,
might really have been dazzled with the splen-
dour of his rank or the fascination of his con-
versation; while it seemed the most unaccount-

‘able part of the whole affair, that if such were
the ease, the attachment had not been reci-
procal, between a young and beautiful girl,
thrown so continually in his way, and an aged
roué, who had so evidently admired her.

If the probable duration of Lord Doncas-
ter’s life had been measured according to the
estimate formed of it in many an Edinburgh
drawing-room, it would have brought a very

56 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

small premium indeed at the insurance offices.
By referring to that valuable record, Debrett’s
peerage, it was satisfactorily proved that the
De Crespignys were a very short-lived family !
One Lord Doncaster had died of a fall from
his horse at thirty-five; another had been
killed in battle, at forty-two; and not one of
them had contrived very much to exceed
eighty, therefore hopes might be entertained
of the popular and fascinating Louis de Cres-
pigny at last gaining the long-expected “step.”
It might have been supposed by strangers in
Edinburgh, that there was but one marquisate
in Britain, so frequently were the strawberry
leaves of Lord Doncaster under animated dis-
cussion; and any visitor who accidentally
took Burke or Debrett in his hand, might
smile to observe that the pages naturally fell
open where that interesting paragraph pre-
sented itself to notice,

“Doncaster, Marquis of. Heir presumptive, Louis Henry
De Crespigny.”

A tradition prevailed among the elder ladies
of fashion now in society, that a splendid set

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 57

of diamonds, which had been long the orna-
ment and admiration of Queen Charlotte's
drawing-rooms, were since entailed, by an old
Lady Doncaster, in the family; and many a
young beauty, in arranging a bright futurity
on her own plan, had frequently worn these
far-famed jewels in her imagination, when
presented at Court as a Marchioness, the
envy and admiration of all her contemporaries.
Meantime nothing could be more astonishing
than to find how much was known in Edin-
burgh concerning the modes of life, temper,
and character of the present Lord Doncaster,
though he lived not only secluded from society,
but made it his peculiar study to evade the
scrutiny of impertinent curiosity, and was so
anxious to check the loquaciousness of servants,
that his butler and housekeeper had strict or-
ders to keep up a sort of prison discipline in
the establishment, and not allow a word to
be spoken when at meals. It was, however,
authentically ascertained by some unknown
means, that Lord Doncaster, who had formerly
been a man of dissipated habits and irregular

58 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

hours, now devoted himself to the care of his
health as diligently and intensely as a miser
does to the care of his money, and that to him
it had become a subject of almost avaricious
interest. If the Marquis had a finger-ache,
it was magnified in Edinburgh into a ease of
certain death; but after a really severe illness,
he was heard jocularly to remark, in sporting
phrase, “I have had another round with
death !” while he seemed confident, on these
occasions, of always coming off victorious,
though few among the young ladies of his
nephew’s acquaintance would have been found
ready to back his expectations, while Agnes
Dunbar impatiently remarked, that Lord Don-
caster had been so long in the world, he seemed
not to know how to leave it.

It was generally understood by the juries
who sat upon Lord Doneaster’s case in society,
that his breakfast consisted of strong gravy
soup and poached eggs, which were pronounced
to be very plethoric,—he ate no luncheon,
which must be very exhausting at his time
of life—he had an enormous appetite for din-

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 59

ner, which would certainly drive blood to his
head,—and above all, he took a hot supper,
which must be fatal at last;—every newspaper
tends to prove, that after eating a hearty sup-
per the night before, people are invariably
found dead in their beds the next morning ;—
and it was already unaccountable how many
mornings Lord Doncaster had survived! Any
day in the world might bring accounts of his
death,—some day must do so, sooner or later,
—hundreds of old people were dying continu-
ally, and so might the superannuated peer ;
yet though his days were numbered in so many
houses, they nevertheless seemed to be num-
berless, while gentlemen, older than himself,
were often heard impatiently speculating and
wondering what will he would make, and de-
elaring they only wished to live, in order to
know the result of so many anxious conjec-
tures, while his dutiful nephew gayly remarked,
that his uncle need never wait for parchment
to write his will upon, while the skin on his
face looked so like it.

Still Lord Doncaster obstinately persevered

60 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

in living on, while, strange to say, many of
the manceuvring mamas who had been heard
to declare, that if an old person must die at
any rate, they could spare his Lordship better
than any other mortal, became mortal them-
selves, and were first consigned to the tomb.
Even some of the young and lovely girls,
who had thought, in the morning of life, before
the freshness of their bloom had been dimmed,
or the lustre of their beauty had decayed, that
this one obstacle to their happiness must be
remoyed,—many of these gay, joyous, and un-
thinking beings had sunk unexpectedly into
an early grave, while still Lord Doncaster, in
a most provoking and unprincipled manner,
disappointed everybody, and continued to exist
in a world where he was anything but welcome,
resolved apparently, never, in an every-day
vulgar way, to die at all.

In the mean time, Louis De Orespigny, de-
voted to the amusements of life, but indepen-
dent of all its finer sympathies, seemed to
breathe nothing but the exhilarating ether of
life, joyous, giddy, and intoxicating. He re-

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 61

yelled in a laughing, lively, satirical conscious-
ness of his own exact position in society, and
privately resolved to make the most of it,—not
that he deliberately made up his mind to de-
ceive,—his code of honour was rigid enough in
respect to his transactions with gentlemen, but
in the case of young ladies it was otherwise,—

 

Man, to man so oft unjust,
Is always so to woman,”

With ladies Mr De Crespigny considered
his own brilliant prospects and personal fasci-
nations to be fair, marketable produce, which
there could be no objection that he should use
to the utmost advantage, for bringing in the
largest possible return of pleasure, profit, and
amusement. Accordingly, the gay young Cor-
net, living upon what he could borrow, on
the disinterested attentions of manceuvring
mothers, and on the expectation of his uncle’s
speedy demise, made himself the chosen at-
tendant of half a hundred accomplished and
perfectly amiable young ladies, who laughed,
talked, sang, and danced with him, while he
soon became but too intimately known as a

62 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

ruthless flirt, to many a young heart, and to
many a happy home, where he took care that
it should be distinctly implied and understood,
that nothing but the jealous penuriousness of
“that old quiz, Lord Doncaster,” impeded his
ardent wish to settle for life; while in the
mean time, wherever a good table and cellar
were kept, he testified exactly such a degree
of partiality for the sister or daughter of his
host, as made her be considered his wife-pre-
sumptive, and secured him a regular knife and
fork in the house on all family festivals and
state occasions, without any trouble in either
ordering or paying for the entertainment. Tt
has been said, that as a rolling stone gathers
no moss, neither does a roving heart gain any
affection; but whatever might be the case
with others, Louis De Crespigny felt himself
without a doubt the idol of every draw-
ing-room, where he sentimentalized, rattled,
and flirted in every style, with every girl under
twenty, as diligently as if he were canvassing
for an election, while they talked, looked,
smiled, and dressed their yery best; and the

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 63

excellence of any gentleman’s wine might be
accurately estimated by the thermometer of
Mr De Crespigny’s attention to the daughters;
but he had a declared abhorrence of family
dinners, which looked too business-like and
domestic, as if he had really committed him-
self; though, as Lady Towercliffe remarked to
her four daughters one day, “he never said
anything to the purpose, when the purpose
was marriage.”

Though Mr De Crespigny seemed, at the
“dignity dinners” in Edinburgh, to live for no
other object on earth, but the one fascinating
young lady, with whom it was his game at the
time to appear epris, and though she might pro-
bably be astonished and piqued during the fol-
lowing week, to observe this indefatigable ama-
teur in flirtations equally assiduous in his atten-
tions to another, and shooting like a brilliant
meteor in the ball-room, unheedingly past her-
self, yet she might console herself by reflecting,
that Mr De Crespigny was in the habit of con-
fidentially hinting how much he felt embar-
rassed and annoyed by the necessity of gene-

64 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

ralizing his intimacies, that no gossiping re-
ports might reach his very whimsical relative.
“Because actually !” he one day whispered in
confidence to Lady Towereliffe, “when my
uncle becomes irritable, he threatens to make
all sorts of ridiculous marriages himself; and
it would be my last hour in his will, if he
thought me heretic enough merely to dance
with a Protestant partner. He would not en-
gage so much as a housemaid of your persua-
sion; but for my own part, I leave all these
concerns to the Abbé Mordaunt, who, to do
him justice, lets me off very easily.”

The difference of faith made wonderfully
little difference in the intentions of those young
ladies who believed themselves the objects of
Mr De Crespigny’s unacknowledged preference,
for every bit of millinery in a ball-room was
in a flutter of agitation whenever he ap-
proached ; and certainly no one ever excelled
more in the happy art of making those he
conversed with rise in their own opinion, from
his tact in showing how very high they stood
in his, and the consequence was, that he al-

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 65

ready possessed a rare and romantic collection
of sentimental valentines, sketches with his
figure in the foreground, songs with the ma-
gical name of Louis conspicuously introduced,
withered bouquets, anagrams, anonymous let-
ters, and anonymous verses, all with a too-
well-remembered. history belonging to them,
which called up a smile of derision, or a sigh of
self-reproach, according as the caso required,
but all treasured as relics of former happy
hours, which had perhaps been the history of
a lifetime to the fair donors, and the diversion
of a few days only to himself, while he secretly
applauded his own dexterity in always escap-
ing the matrimonial noose, and to them there
remained only the silent remembrance of that
intercourse, now for ever at an end, which
they had believed was to last for life.

Mr De Crespigny’s engagement book was
nearly as complicated an affair as any ledger
or day-book, and much more so than his own
banker’s account, for he arranged it on the
most systematic principles of profit and loss.
In whatever house he had been invited to

66 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

dine, he considered himself as “ owing a quad-
rille” to ohe of the young ladies at the next
assembly. If he had actually “sat under her
father’s mahogany,” as he termed it, she might
be perhaps entitled to two dances; and when
he had spent the greater part of a summer in
her mother’s country house, that established
a sort of sinking fund on her behalf, which en-
titled her to have the use of him as a partner,
whenever he happened accidentally to be dis-
engaged, though indeed nothing ever occurred
accidentally in Captain De Crespigny’s ar-
rangements, for he never acted on impulse,
but always on systematic calculation. He
seemed, with his gay pell-mell manner, the
most off-hand, careless, and undesigning of
men; but even in the trifling affair of going
to a ball, where he might literally have ex-
claimed, “I am monarch of all I survey,” he
invariably carried in his mind’s eye a list of
all those partners with whom policy or self-in-
terest directed him to dance, and very seldom
indeed did he swerve from his preconceived
muster-roll.

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 67

It was a singular evidence of young De Cres-
pigny’s discretion and skill, that, while paying
attentions which should either have never been
paid at all, or never afterwards discontinued,
and while, with all his fascinations, Lady
Towercliffe declared it was dangerous to a
young lady’s happiness to be even introduced
to him, still, in not one instance had “ his in-
tentions” ever yet been asked, and neither
fathers, uncles, nor brothers, had betrayed the
slightest symptoms of insurrection against his
universal dominion, believing, as his exeuse for
delaying to propose was so perfectly unanswer-
able and respectable, that his intentions might
safely be allowed to “lie on the table,” while
they awaited in breathless suspense the de
nouement, certainly to take place on Lord
Doneaster’s death.

Some of Mr De Orespigny’s brother officers,
envious perhaps of his extraordinary success
in society, threw out sceptical hints respecting
the certainty of his succession, and laughed
sarcastically at the indefatigable vanity with
which he evidently liked being thus torn to

68 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

pieces among the chaperons and dowagers of
society; but he laughed as heartily as them-
selves. No one could ever get the start of
him in a joke; and his associates, when he
came in competition with any one of them,
found it no laughing matter. He knew his
own power—who does not know that?—and
difficulties only enhanced his triumph.

Lord Doneaster often dryly remarked, that
the best economist in Britain must certainly
be Louis De Crespigny, as, to his certain
knowledge, he possessed only 1.300 a-year,
and. yet he seemed to revel in all the luxuries
of life, besides having a great deal over for ex-
travagance. There was no occasion for the
young Cornet ever to think of dining at his
club, as he might be entertained at the houses
of three or four friends in a day, if he could
have mustered as many appetites. In summer
he incurred no expense, except to pay for his
place occasionally on the top of a coach, or in
a steam-boat, from one hospitable country-
house to another, where gigs were sent a stage
to meet him on the way, if he were expected

seen waiting on tho pier. Ho got “a mount”
from ono friend, the best seat in a barouche
from another, and often the vacant place in a
britschska from a third party, even to the
expulsion of its more legitimate occupiers.
“De Crespigny has nothing on carth, and
you see how he looks!” remarked his hand-
some friend Sir Patrick one day to Sir Ar-
thur Dunbar; “ yet how magnificently he
contrives to live at the expense of all thoso
deluded mortals who have disposable or indis-
posable daughters. His future prospects act
like a cork jacket in society, keeping him
always at the top. Last summer worthy Lord
Towoereliffe, with his rapidly increasing family
and rapidly decreasing income, took De Cres-
pigny in his gig to that old tumble-down
eastlo of his in Argyloshire, where he spent
six weeks, ruining the family in champagne
and wax candles. The house becamo rather

cast in Lady Winandermere’s carriage to that

combe, where he found excellent yachting and
sea-bathing. There he lingered a month, till
the brother of those four pretty Miss Vava-
sours bid still higher for his company, by
offering him a mount at Kelso, and mention-
ing that he had a first-rate French cook
a.‘ cordon bleu,’ who hires his own stall at the
opera during the London season, and enjoys a
salary and perquisites amounting to more
than the best curacy in the English Church ;
and all this De Crespigny repays with a few
frothy nothings, which he is for ever repeat-
ing to any young lady who will lend an ear.
Those who beat the bush do not always snare
the bird; and I wonder the manceuvring
world does not yet see that he is evidently no
marrying man.”

““ What sort of looking individual is ‘ a
marrying man?” asked Sir Arthur, slyly.
“Tam often told that you, for instance, do
not look like a marrying man; but pray point
me out any one who does, that I may become
more @ connoisseur on the subject than I am.
As for what you say of Louis De Crespigny,

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 7

it sounds to my unpractised ear very like
swindling; and he is not the youth I took him
for if he live in such an element of deceit,
sacrificing all ‘sense of honour, all confidence,
and all good feeling, for a worthless and tran-
sient popularity, or worse than all, for motives
of mean heartless self-interest. Such a man
is not worth the space he occupies in the
world !”

The Admiral’s honest indignation would
have been vented in still stronger terms,
could his upright and honourable mind have
been made to understand how entirely every
thought, word, and action of Mr De Cres-
pigny’s life was based on the most unswerving
principles of cold, hard, unrelenting selfish-
ness, and with what utter carelessness he
seemed ready to trample on the wounded
feelings of others ; for it mattered not to him
what degree of confidence he betrayed, or
what degree of sorrow he inflicted. If in one
house where he had been received as a son
or a brother, he no longer found the cordial
welcome of other days, a hundred other doors

were still opened wide to receive him, where
he could boast of having been “ very nearly
caught,” and } carry on the same game as be-
fore, which was a<pastime to him, though
fatal to the peaco of'many, who would will-
ingly have died, rather than betray the injury
their feelings had suffered, when, after passing
through the ordeal of his ‘assiduities, they
found themselves beguiled and cheated of all
that was deepest and most sacred in their
earthly affections—robbed without compune-
tion by one who gave no return—who watched
with elated triumph the growing delusion of
those whom he had marked as victims to his
own self-love, and whom he appeared to con-
sider all in all to his happiness, till they found
out at last that they were in reality less than
nothing to him; yet the deception admitted
of no redress. He lived on in a sort of
cowardly impunity; for no young girl en-
dowed with sensibility, and conscious of her
own injuries, could desire, after entrusting
him with the whole story of her hopes and
affections, that the truth should be known;

and his was a crime against which no evidence
ean be brought; for who could describe the
tender nothings—the refined insinuations—
tho looks which say everything and mean no-
thing—the wordless language of the eyes, with
which an undeclared love may be safely and
yet obviously professed? What but a smile
of ridicule or of censure could attend on such
a detail of “ unutterable things?” But with
Louis De Crespigny nothing was unutterable ;
for he could say and unsay the same things
two hundred times, and they always seemed
to carry as much or as little weight as he
pleased at the moment, while he entered so-
ciety as a school-boy rushes into a garden,
eagerly to pursue the brilliant insects flutter-
ing in the sunbeams, ready to crush and in-
jure them all for his momentary diversion,
and yet on his guard to retreat in good order,
should there appear to be the slightest danger
of annoyance or discomfort to himself.

iy was impossible to pass an hour in the so-
ciety of Sir Arthur Dunbar, without seeing
much to admire, and much also to love,—
there was a sturdy, resolute, old-fashioned
sense of honour in all his actions, tempered by
the kindest and most considerate attention to
the feelings, as well as to the interests of all
with whom he might be associated, and his
sentiments were tinetured by a generous liber-
ality, only limited in action by the rigid re-
straints consequent on a very narrow income,
which he had never been known to exceed,

counts were paid, would scareely buy him a
pair of gloves.

Though the fire of Sir Arthur’s eyes had
been quenched by approaching blindness, and
his ‘weather-beaten countenance had been
scarred in battle, and hardened by facing
every tempest which had blown for half a
century, yet his aspect had an air of habitual
distinction and conscious dignity which com-
manded instant respect. There was an encr-
gy in the expression of his feelings, and a
straight-forward pursuit of what he thought
right in all his actions, which gave him a sin-
gular influence over the affections and the
conduct of those with whom he wished to as-
sociate, and the admirable use he made of
which no one afterwards ever had cause to
regret. His early life had been one full of
action and of vigorous exertion, seeking, with
old-fashioned patriotism, the honour of his
country, more than the promotion of his own

he directed his time and talents to the diffu-
sion of happiness at home, and to a zealous,
diligent, and humble preparation for that long
and quiet home to which he believed himself
rapidly approaching, and which he contem-
plated'with the best of all philosophy,—that
of a truly devoted Christian.

With all the blunt frankness of his sailor-
like manner, Sir Arthur could nevertheless
testify an almost feminine gentleness and sym-
pathy towards the unfortunate. He was often
discovered to have exerted clandestinely, a
degree of activity and zeal in serving the most
needy and desolate, which, to a mind less
eager and gencrous, would have seemed almost
incredible,—he never lacerated the feelings of
those who came to him for comfort, by at-
tempting to convince the sufferer, as most
people begin by doing, on such occasions, that
the misfortune, whatever it be, is all his own
fault,—and he was quite as ready, as well as
much better pleased, to rejoice with those
that rejoiced, than to weep with those that
wept, without ever, at any period of life, hay-

ing found a place for envy in his kindest of
hearts, which

« Turn’d at the touch of jay or woe,
‘And turning trembled too.”

With a good-humoured smile at his own
eredulity in having believed that Louis De
Crespigny could ever be serious in proposing
to sacrifice a day of his gay and busy life, to
a prosing téte-a-téte on the sea-beach with an
old man like himself, Sir Arthur dismissed the
subject from his thoughts, and finally relin-
quished all hope of seeing his young friend,
after a short soliloquy, in which he ended, by
slyly hoping that the gay Cornet would never
cause those who might feel it more, to regret
his having jilted them.

Not many days following, the Admiral had
retired at his usual early hour to bed, and
after some time passed in profound repose, he
was suddenly startled into wakefulness at the
dawn of day, while the watchman was calling
the hour of “ Past four o'clock,” by a loud
and yehement knocking at the front-door of

78 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

his house, accompanied by the most fearful
and vociferous out-cries of “ murder !” It was
the sharp, shrill tone of a woman in the agony
of fear, becoming more and more vehement at
every repetition of the ery, while Sir Arthur
dressed with the rapidity of a practised sea-
man, and hurried down stairs, where he found
his maid-of-all-work, and his man-of-all-work,
already assembled in breathless consternation
round a trembling, terrified-looking servant
girl, whose eyes were gleaming with an ex-
pression of frantic alarm, while, from her in-
coherent exclamations, Sir Arthur could only
gather that some act of unutterable horror
had been perpetrated in an opposite house,
the windows of which were all partially closed,
except one in the upper story, which was wide
open, and seemed to be much broken and
shattered.

Without waiting another moment to inves-
tigate the business, Sir Arthur strode across
the street, hurried in at the open door, and
guided by a momentary cry of childish dis-
tress, he mounted the staircase, with an acti-

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 79

vity beyond his years, three steps at a time,
and precipitately entered the nearest room he
could find. There he paused for a moment
on finding himself in a splendidly-furnished
bed-room, adorned with a degree of taste and
elegance, far excelling what was customary in
so obseure-looking a lodging, and the Admiral
was about hastily to withdraw, when he be-
came suddenly transfixed to the spot, and his
eye seemed perfectly blasted by the spectacle
which met his agitated and astonished gaze,
while several moments elapsed before he had
nerve to advance, and ascertain the reality of
a scene, which filled him with horror.

On @ magnificent couch, the rich coverlet
of which was drenched in blood, that had
sprinkled the floor, and spouted to the very
roof of the room, lay the eold stiffened corpse
of a young female, whose head seemed to have
been nearly severed from her body, while a
violent contusion appeared upon her forehead.
The wrist of her right hand, with which she
had probably attempted to defend herself, had

“ also been deeply cut, and in her hand she

grasped a quantity of dark hair, which seem-
ed to have been torn from the head of her
assassin in the struggle for life. Her teeth
were clenched, and her eye-balls were starting
from their sockets with a look of agonised
fear, most appalling to behold, and her long
fair hair which lay in disordered billows on
her shoulders, was matted with gore.

A table near the bed had been overturned
and broken,—a knife of very peculiar form,
bent and distorted, lay conspicuously upon
the pillow, as if placed there on purpose to
attract notice, and the carpet, on which a
pool of congealed blood had gathered, was
likewise strewed with money, rings, bijouterie,
trinkets, and plate.

Nestled in a little erib, close beside the
murdered woman, but plunged in a slumber so
profound, that it could not be natural, slept
undisturbed and uninjured, a lovely boy of
about eight years old. His head rested on
his arm, and a clustering profusion of jet-
black hair fell over his blooming countenance,
in which there was a look of almost death-like

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 81

repose. Awakened withthe utmost difficulty
by Sir Arthur, the child, who appeared to be
of wondrous beauty, opened for a moment, a
pair of bright blue, star-like eyes, and with a
ery of terror, called for his mother, but a
moment afterwards, overcome by irresistible
drowsiness, his rosy cheek dropped upon the
pillow, his heavy eyes were closed, and he re-
lapsed into the same strange, mysterious in-
sensibility as before.

It was a fearful sight, that young mother,
with her look of ghastly agony turned towards
the ruddy healthful countenance of her child
in his peaceful slumbers, and it was evident
that her last thought had been for him, as his
clothes were still convulsively held in her left
hand, while a vain attempt had obviously been
made to tear them asunder,—many deep cuts
being visible on the child’s night-gown, though
his person had been left uninjured.

Sir Arthur compassionately snatched the
boy up in his arms, to hurry him away from
the dreadful scene, and called the watchman,
who instantly raised an alarm, and summoned.

82 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

the whole neighbourhood to his assistance,
when before ten minutes had elapsed, the
room was filled with a crowd of agitated spec-
tators, scared by the tremendous event, and
crowding around the bed in every attitude of
astonishment, terror, and commiseration, ut-
tering exclamations of alarm, gazing helpless-
ly at the frightful spectacle, and forming a
thousand conjectures respecting the tragical
event, instead of attempting to give any ra
tional assistance.

“Not a moment is to be lost!” said Sir
Arthur, in the steady authoritative tone of
one accustomed in great emergencies, to com-
mand, ‘“ Where are the other servants /”
asked he, turning to the girl who had first
given an alarm, “ and where is your master?”

“T have no master, Sir!” replied she in a /
low incoherent whisper. “I think the lady”
was not married; but perhaps, Sir, she might
be! A gentleman called here last week.”-

“What was he like?” asked Sir Arthur.
earnestly.

“A sort of clergyman, or gentleman, Sir !

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. . % 83

I don’t know nothing about him, but he visit-
ed sometimes at this here house. No good
ever came of it though, for my poor young
mistress was always in sore distress after he'd
be gone away. Last time there be much
loud talking and argufying in the parlour,
but it was none of my business to listen. I
never pays no attention to what the quality
says!”

“ Here is a most disastrous business!”
exclaimed Sir Arthur, in a deep and solemn
tone, while he glanced at the crowd of white,
livid, ashy faces, collected around him. “ Let
us remember, my friends, that every trifle we
ean observe here, may be of the utmost im-
portance in bringing this dreadful mystery to
light. Touch nothing, but have all your eyes
about you to detect what you can, and let us
instantly search the house.”

With the little boy in his arms, who had
awakened, bewildered and terrified by the
sight of so many strangers, Sir Arthur, fol-
lowed by the whole troop of spectators, who
huddled together with evident symptoms of

84 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

fearful apprehension, proceeded minutely to
scrutinize the whole house.

In one apartment on the garret floor, be-
longing, as the terrified housemaid declared,
to a person who had been taken in, she be-
lieved out of charity, to teach the little boy,
the bed was disordered, as if the sleeper,
when hastily rising, had thrown the bed-
clothes almost upon the floor. The window-
frame was broken to shivers, by some one
violently forcing his way out; but no other
sign appeared of the room having been in-
habited. Not an article of clothing could
be found in the drawers; not a book or a
paper; and the search was about to be aban-
doned, when Sir Arthur perceived in an ob-
secure corner of the room, a man’s glove,
stained with blood, and a red silk handker-
chief, from which the initials had evidently
been erased with great care, though he hoped
that some one more accustomed to such in-
vestigations might yet be able to trace
them.

The next room which Sir Arthur attempt-

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 85

ed to enter had the door double-locked ; and
though the party which accompanied him
made a noise of knocking and hammering
that might have raised the dead, no answer
was returned, till at length, losing all pati-
ence, they broke it open, and impetuously
rushed forward, all gazing eagerly around, as
if they expected an immediate denowement of
the mystery to take place ; but some of those
who were foremost shrunk back in astonish-
ment, and hastily made way for Sir Arthur,
while the servant girl earnestly whispered in
his ear, with a look of anxiety and alarm,
“ This is Sarah Davenport’s room ! the child’s
maid! Better not disturb her, Sir! She
is sometimes hardly right in her mind, I
think !”

When Sir Arthur, disregarding the simple
girl's warning, advanced, he perceived with
surprise, a very young woman, scarecly twen-
ty, who started up in bed, with a look of be-
wildered perplexity, as he approached, asking
in accents of tremulous alarm, what had oc-
eurred to cause this extraordinary disturb-

86 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

ance. Her cheek was of an ashy paleness,
her yery lips were blanched, and her voice
sounded husky and hollow with agitation ;
but all this might be attributed to so sudden
an inroad of strangers, while again and again
she asked with quivering accents, whether any
accident had occurred, and why they all ap-
peared so alarmed.

“At all events, my darling boy is safe !”
added she, holding out her arms to the child,
who instantly recoiled from her, with looks of
unequivocal terror, and hiding his face on the
shoulder of Sir Arthur, he sobbed aloud with
a degree of passionate grief and agitation,
which seemed almost beyond his years. The
observant eye of Sir Arthur perceived that
a dark scowl of malignity flitted for a mo-
ment across the beautiful features of Sarah,
whose brow became singularly contracted over
her flashing eyes; but making an effort in-
stantly to recover herself, she averted her
countenance, and added in a subdued voice of
assumed tranquillity, “The child never knows
meinacap! I forgot to take it off, but the

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 87

hurry of seeing so many strangers has con-
fused me !”

In an instant she snatched off her night-
cap, when, her shoulders and neck became
covered with a cloud of dark massy ringlets,
floating down below her waist, and shading
her pallid countenance, which had assumed
an expression of livid horror, and unnatural
wildness. ‘‘ Let him come to me now!” ‘add-
ed she again, stretching out her arms with a
ghastly smile; but the boy struggled more
vehemently than before, and clung to Sir
Arthur with a tenacity and confidence, which
deeply touched the old veteran’s heart, who
tried to soothe the terrified child by every en-
dearment which his kind nature could sug-
gest, while his attention was nevertheless en-
chained by observing the rigid, marble look
of the young woman’s countenance ; the drag-
ged and corpse-like appearance which stole
over her features, as if she had suffered a
stroke of paralysis.

“You have been frightened enough already,
poor boy !” said Sir Arthur, soothingly. “No

88 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

one shall hurt you! With me at least, you
are safe! Stay where you are, and do not
be alarmed! No one shall touch you but my-
self!”

The child seemed to understand Sir Ar-
thur’s promise of protection, and his head
drooped sleepily down, while his eyes again
closed in that deep unnatural slumber, from
which he had been with so much difficulty
aroused, till at length,

« Now like a shutting flower, the senses close,
‘And on him lies the beauty of repose.”

“ Young woman !” said Sir Arthur, bend-
ing a look of penetrating scrutiny on Sarah
Davenport, “how came you to be quietly
asleep, and partly dressed too! while your
mistress was murdered in the room immedi-
ately below! Did you hear no disturbance?
Was no alarm given ” ————

“My mistress !!” exclaimed Sarah, clasp-
ing her hands in an attitude of astonishment,
and speaking as if every word would choke her,
though not a muscle of her face was altered

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 89

from the fixed and rigid look it had previ-
ously worn. “Oh! what will become of me !”

“What will become of you!!” exclaimed
Sir Arthur, sternly, fixing his penetrating eye
upon her. “Think rather of your murdered
mistress! Come, come, girl! you performed
that start very well; but I know good act-
ing! I greatly fear you are more concerned
in this horrid business than we at first sus-
pected, and much more than you would wish
to acknowledge. Get up instantly, and fol-
low me !”

There was something fearful and appalling
in the silence which reigned among the many
persons who had gathered around, when Sa-
rah, as a prisoner, was led into the chamber
of death. A look of shuddering horror dis-
torted for a moment, her’ pale and haggard
countenance, when she was unwillingly drawn
forward to the place where her deceased mis-
tress lay, and Sir Arthur with silent solem-
nity, pointed to the ghastly spectacle. His
eyes were intensely and most mournfully fixed
on the prisoner's sullen and nearly livid coun-

90 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

tenance, while she silently clung to a chair to
support herself.

Sarah appeared neither startled nor asto-
nished after the first thrill of horror, but with
a cold stony look of almost preternatural
calmness, she muttered to herself in a low
tone, which became nevertheless distinctly
audible to all the spectators, and was evidently
meant to be heard,—

“Why am I brought here! I know nothing
about this! The poor lady has committed
suicide! No wonder! She often wished her-
self dead! She had a miserable lifo of it, and-
has got rest at last! I wish!” added Sarah
suddenly, with vehement and almost frantic
energy, “ O how I wish that I could change
places with her! O that I could be that cold
senseless image, without memory or feeling,
without hope or fear, shut up from living
wretchedness in everlasting sleep !”

“Let us hope that the Almighty has in
mercy received her never-dying soul, and that
in His own good time he will reveal the guilty
assassins, who sent her so suddenly to judg-

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 91

ment,” said, Sir Arthur, solemnly. ‘“ Unbur-
den your own mind now, by confessing all,
and be assured it, will relieve the agony you
are evidently suffering. Murder is like fire,
it cannot be smothered long.”

“T know nothing! What could I know!”
replied Sarah, hurriedly.“ She has destroy-
ed herself, or thieves have broken into the
house and robbed her. Could I help that?”

“ No one has broken into this house,” re-
plied Sir Arthur, scanning the expression of
her fixed, and apparently unalterable features.
-“ But you can perhaps tell us who escaped
by that shattered window above? Not a lock
is broken—not a door is injured—not a trin-
ket seems missing, among the many scattered
around the room! Here is money in abun-
dance, if gold had been the inducement!
Some other motive has provoked this crime—
jealousy perhaps—or revenge—”

At the last word an angry hectic rushed
over the face, arms, and neck of the prisoner,
and her eye glittered for a moment with an
unnatural fire, which rapidly faded away.

92 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

leaving her as pale and deathrlike as the
corpse beside which she stood, and on which
her eye now rested with a look of cold and
passionless indifference.

“Tt was only yesterday that she wished
herself dead! this is her own doing!” said
Sarah, turning away. “ Why am I brought
here! This is too dreadful! too shocking!
It will drive me mad—it will! it will!” added
she, with rising agitation; and then suddenly
bursting into a hideous maniacal laugh, which
rang with fearful sound through the gloomy
chamber, and caused the horror-struck spec-
tators to fall hastily back,—“ I would have
saved her! I would! What woman ever sheds
blood! but it was too late! I would have
saved her, as I saved the child; but it was
done—kill me! kill me! if you have any
mercy, let me die! Ict me hide myself in the
grave for ever!” Saying these words, with a
seream of agony, she fell upon the floor in
violent convulsions, from which it was nearly an
hour before she entirely recovered, when faint,
weak, and exhausted, Sir Arthur suggested

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 93

that she should be carried to bed; but before
she left the room, anxious if possible to eluci-
date the mystery, and to gain some clue for
pursuing the actual murderer, he detained
Sarah during a moment, and desired that a
glass of water might be brought for her, hop-
ing that the violent emotion she had betrayed
might lead her to a full confession. Laying
his hand then upon her-arm, in tones of deep
and awful solemnity, he looked at her, and
pointed once more to the corpse, saying,—

“ By a dark and harrowing crime those
lips are sealed in the silence of death! What
a tale they could disclose, if they might but
once describe all that passed in this room a
few hours ago! Those very walls have echoed
this night to her eries! You alone seem able
to throw any light upon the horrid deed.
You could tell all, or I am greatly mistaken.
We shall yet know, at the day of judgment,
if not sooner, how this fearful act was done.
Consider, Sarah Davenport, that undying re-
morse will pursue you through life, and be the
fitting tenant of your soul, unless by timely

94 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

repentance you avert the fearful doom, and
hereafter your heart will be tortured by
the pangs of eternal despair. Unfortunate
woman! consider now, or during the long
period of your approaching imprisonment,
whether it be better to repent and confess at
once, or to confess and suffer everlastingly.”

Not a word or a look gave evidence that
Sarah so much as heard Sir Arthur speak.
Her large eyes were vacantly fixed on the
ground, her hands were firmly clenched, and
her teeth were set with an air of resolute de-
termination, when, after a silence of several
minutes, during which her very stillness was
frightful, supported by some of the strangers
around, she walked with almost mechanical -
unconsciousness out of the room.

Again and again the house was searched
that day—the very floors and wainscots torn
up; but not a trace could be discovered to
throw light upon the cause or cireumstances
of this disastrous event ; and equally remark-
able was it, that no hint could be obtained of
who or what the murdered lady had been.

MODERN FLIRTATIONSS 95

There were books on the table in various lan-
guages, but not one retained any name writ-
ten on the boards, though it was evident that
on some @ coat of arms had once been pasted,
and subsequently defaced. Not a letter or
paper could be found with either signature or
direction, though one or two notes were dis-
covered beneath the pillow of the bed, all
anonymous, but written in a similar hand,
and containing nothing that. could identify
the writer ; and several sketches of the child,
beautifully executed in various attitudes, were
found in a portfolio, beside which were writ-
ten many simple verses, containing the most
fervent expressions of tender affection and
anxious solicitude for the boy, and the most
passionate bursts of melancholy, but all con-
ceived in general terms, which baffled the re-
searches of curiosity.

“ This hand is disguised, yet surely I have
seen it before,” said Sir Arthur, musingly ex-
amining the anonymous notes, which related
chiefly to remittances of money. “ The faco
of that appalling spectacle sometimes seems

96 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

also familiar to me. Have I not met with it
already, or is this only the delusion of an ex-
cited mind? These deep and prominent eye-
lids—the small aquiline nose—the delicately-
pencilled eye-brows—and that mouth of per-
fect grace and beauty, which seems still
almost to speak without a tongue, in the lan-
guage of heart-broken misery, telling of de-
ceived affections—of blighted hopes—of un-
pitied and solitary tears.”

Sir Arthur seated himself on a chair beside
the couch for some moments in agitated re-
flection, vainly endeavouring to collect his
thoughts, and form them into some tangible
remembrance. “It is a strange and bewil-
dering sensation, to look at the mute features
of this death-like image, and to feel as if once
she had been known to me in her days of
youth and bloom. A vague harassing per-
plexity besets me in trying to realize the
floating and flickering remembrances, which
dimly mock my efforts to catch them. It
seoms like staring out on a dark night, and
trying to distinguish some busy seone, where

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 97

figures and lights appear; and vanish again
before they can be identified. Where have
we met before? Surely in some dream of for-
mer days I once saw asmile of joy on those
pallid lips—I once beheld those fixed and
glassy eyes lighted up with intelligence! but
my treacherous memory will not help me—it
recalls enough to torture me with perplexity,
and not enough to be of any actual avail.”

Sir Arthur wearied himself with intense
efforts to identify the lineaments before him,
but in vain. They. were lovely indeed, and
many a stranger came likewise to try whether
they could be recognized, but without success.
The fearful story circulated like wild-fire—the
excitement and curiosity it produced became
intense; but not a gleam of light was thrown
upon the dark and mysterious event.

Among the many who hurried to behold
the murdered woman before her remains were
disturbed, two gentlemen arrived one evening
after dusk, and having ascertained that nei-
ther the Admiral nor any other stranger was
in the house, they gave Sir Arthur’s servant,

VoL. 1. B

Martin, who was in attendance, a handsome
donation, and desiring him not to follow, hur-
ried up stairs, and remained in the room
alone for several minutes. Both were much
muffled up, and evidently avoided any seru-
tiny of their countenances; but they seemed
greatly agitated on leaving the room; and as
they hastened past Martin, and threw them-
selves into a hackney coach which awaited
them at some distance, one of the party had
appeared so overcome, that he could not
walk without support. Much conjecture was
aroused by this incident, which seemed to in-
erease the mystery and interest attached to
the melancholy circumstances, and not a
doubt could be entertained that these untime- -
ly visitors had a more than common connec-
tion with the affair, but of what nature, and to
what degree, could only admit of very vague
conjecture.

Nothing could exceed the active interest
taken in all the proceedings by Sir Arthur,
who seemed to forgot all his years and infir-
mities, while keenly promoting the cause of

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. ‘a

truth and justice. Much as he had formerly
bemoaned the trouble entailed upon him by
deceased friends, many of whom had be-
queathed their estates and children to his
guardianship, he felt on this occasion, a pity
so intense, for the nameless, friendless, and
helpless boy, thus unexpectedly and tragically
thrown on his compassion, that he publicly
pledged himself to harbour and protect the
child in the mean time, trusting that some
connections might at last be found, to whom
he more naturally belonged. “ Life has had a
mournful commencement for him, poor boy !
His days are dark, and his friends are few,”
said Sir Arthur, with a strong emotion of
pity, “but we must hope the best hereafter,
and do the best that can be done in the mean
time, trusting that a wise Providence, who
cast him on my care and kindness, will also
watch over his future welfare.”

On the night previous to that appointed by
Sir Arthur for committing to the grave the
last remains of the murdered lady, he who
had so often faced death in every form, and

100 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

“ kiss'd the mouth of a cannon in battle,” yet:
felt himself awed and deeply affected in con-
templating the solemn preparations for com-
mitting to the tomb one so young, so deeply
injured, and so apparently unlamented. It
was with mournful and mysterious wonder
that he stood beside the corpse, and contem-
plated that mortal frame, from which the
spirit had been so suddenly and so cruelly
driven; and he could not but imagine the
scenes of love and joy which those eyes had
once probably looked upon—the busy thoughts
that had hurried through that lifeless head—
the warm affections that had flowed through
that heart, now for ever at rest.

While yet his mind was dwelling with pain-
ful interest on all the thoughts which crowded
through his fancy, Martin hastily entered the |
room, and in an agitated voice requested Sir
Arthur's immediate presence in the entrance-
hall, as some persons were there who had or-
ders to communicate only with himself.

On arriving in the passage, Sir Arthur was
astonished, and almost startled, to find seve-

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 101

ral porters in the passage, carrying a coffin
magnificently decorated, and covered with a
velvet pall, on the summit of which was con-
spicuously placed a large brass plate, with the
date of the murder engraved, and bearing
no other inscription, but these two words in
German characters—

My Wite.

“ This is strange!” said Sir Arthur, turn-
ing anxiously to the men. “ Who sent you
here”

“ A gentleman left his orders with the un-
dertaker, Sir. No questions were to be asked ;
and he paid for everything at once, leaving
neither name nor direction,” said the man
who seemed to have charge of the business.
“ We know nothing of him; but he desired
us to deliver this note into your own hands,
and perhaps it may tell you more.”

Sir Arthur hastily tore open the letter
offered to him, giving an impatient glance
at the handwriting, which was exactly simi-
lar to that of the anonymous notes he had

102 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

already so carefully and so vainly scrutinized.
He was astonished; and solemn as the occa-
sion was, almost amused to observe that his
name and direction had been carefully cut
out of the newspaper paragraph which he
quarrelled with some weeks before at the
Club, and that this unknown correspondent,
to prevent the possibility of his writing being
detected by those who examined the outside,
had pasted these printed letters on the cover,
“ Sir Arthur Dunbar, Portobello.” The
packet was sealed with a plain impression on
black wax; the paper bore a broad black
border; and there was an evident tremulous-
ness in the pen which had inscribed these
words :—

“ Enclosed is the sum of L.200, for the
benefit of Sir Arthur Dunbar’s adopted ward,
Henry’De Lancey. The same amount shall
be transmitted annually, so long as no effort
is made to trace from whence it originates ;
and the day he comes of age, it shall be in-
ereased to L.500 per annum. The first at-
tempt to find out his connections will be de-

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 103

tected, and shall put a final period to all in-
tereourse. The unfortunate woman was mar-
ried to one who remained ignorant, till a few
hours ago, of the circumstances attending her
death. She disgraced his name, and aban-
doned his house; nevertheless her child may
one day, perhaps, be acknowledged; and the
whole expenses of his education shall be libe-
rally defrayed, till he is grown up and has
chosen a profession.”

It was a strange, cold, heartless communi-
cation from a parent, without one expression
of relenting affection, one word of solicitude
for his happiness, or one expression of grati-
tude to Sir Arthur for taking upon himself so
arduous a charge; but still it was to a cer-
tain extent most satisfactory, the Admiral
being relieved of a great perplexity, by hav-
ing thus ascertained in what rank of life the
interesting boy should be educated, as he felt
justified now in obtaining for him the highest
cultivation, an advantage to which he attach-
ed the utmost importance, often repeating his
favourite aphorism, that “ principle is the

Tue day of trial at length arrived, and the
court, from the roof to the floor, seemed one
sea of faces, crowded together like the
“studies of heads” on a painter’s canvass.
During the legal investigation, which was
conducted with deep solemnity and anxious
perseverance, the mystery became still deep-
er, and more inscrutable. No appearance of
a robbery could be observed, except that the

ed and discoloured, as if, immediately after
her decease, it had been violently torn off;
and a vain attempt had evidently been made
to snatch away a gold chain hung round
her neck, to which was appended a small bro-
ken miniature frame, set with brilliants, and
adorned with what seemed to represent a
very antique coronet. The portrait which it
once enclosed, had been, with obvious difficul-
ty, removed, as the marks were visible all
round, of some sharp-pointed instrument hay-
ing been inserted in the frame, to which there
still adhered several broken fragments of
glass.

Sarah Davenport, who had been fully com-
mitted for trial, on suspicion of being an ac-
complice, refused to give any references as to
character, and was strongly suspected of ha-
bitually concealing her real name, and of more
than once assuming those that were fictitious,
as her clothes and linen appeared to be mark-
ed with various initials, but in not one case
did they bear those that she pretended were
her own. It was evident that she laboured

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 107

under a powerful, but forcibly-subdued excite-
ment; yet, with a tone and manner externally
cold and hard as Siberian ice, she persisted in
professing her own perfect innocence, and her
utter unconsciousness of anything that might
by possibility lead to a discovery of the per-
petrators. She coldly, and almost calmly,
threw back glance for glance, on the specta-
tors nearest her, who were keenly watching
every turn of her countenance, while dark
surmises, and fearful conjectures, were whis-
pered in murmurs of horror on every side ;
but at length her eye wandered to a distant
part of the court, when suddenly a livid pale-
ness. flashed upon her face—an indescribable
but startling lustre glittered in her eyes—her
whole frame shook, as in the coldest blast of
winter, and with a suppressed groan of agony
and fear, she bowed her head upon her hands,
and sunk fainting upon the floor. At the
same time, a man was observed hastily to
leave the court, and, gliding with rapid steps
through the narrow passages, disappeared,
before any of those who stood near had pre-

sence of mind to stop him, or could even iden-
tify his appearance.

Nothing apparently touched the feelings of
Sarah Davenport, except when a suspicion
seemed to be implied that she wished to in-
jure the boy; and when a question to this
effeet was put to her by the court, she wrung
her hands, and burst into tears, saying, in ac-
cents of piercing anguish, though with a shud-
der, as if death itself were upon her, “No!
oh no! Who suspects that I would injure a
hair of his head! He once loved me! Few
—few but he, ever did! none that have
not afterwards given me reason to hate them !

 

J am a solitary, lost, and desolate being; but
let him not forget in after years, that I saved
his life !—that I saved it at a risk you never
can conceive !”

An impulse of mournful interest and as-
tonishment ran through the assembled multi-
tude, when they beheld the rare and singular
beauty of the child, after he was led into
court ; and it seemed as if the spectators had
ceased to breathe as soon as he began to an-

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 109

swer some of the questions which were skil-
fully put, to draw out his recollections of past
times, and especially the dark history of the
last few weeks. He was at first shy and in-
timidated, but gradually regained an unex-
pected degree of self-possession, and spoke
with surprising intelligence and distinctness
of all he remembered.

The boy retained a faint recollection of
having been awakened, on the night of the
murder, by some violent scene of strife and
horror; but his faculties had evidently been
so beuumbed by opiates, that no distinct im-
pression remained; and to his own young
mind, the whole seemed like a fearful dream,
too dreadful to look back upon even yet, ex-
cept with bewildering terror. He gave a
clear account, however, of the last evening
he had passed with his mother, of whom he
spoke in accents of infantine affection, evi-
dently unable yet to conceive that he should
see her face no more.

An old gentleman, he said, had come into
the room, and spoken angrily to her; while,

110 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

with astonishing precision, the boy acted over
the whole scene, recapitulated some of the
language they had used, and described how
his mother had clung to him with frantic
eagerness, saying she would promise any-
thing, if she might only retain her child ;
how the stranger, who was very tall, and
wore a black coat, had spoken again with
angry vehemence before he left the room;
and how his mother, when alone, had prayed
and wept over him with looks of agonized
and desolate grief, until he had been carried
away to bed by the maid, who administered
some medicine to him, which she said the
doctor had ordered.

He spoke much also of a large old room,
hung with pictures, in which his earliest
days had been passed, and of a small dark
apartment close beside it, into which he
had often been precipitately hurried, appa-
rently for concealment, and where toys and
sweetmeats had been always provided to keep
him quiet, while he was punished with the
utmost severity, for making the slightest

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. lll

noise; and he still remembered with looks
of apprehension, the gentleman dressed in
black, who most frequently visited him there,
and often caused his mother to weep bit-
terly.

Sarah Davenport was then recalled, and
rigidly cross-examined, respecting the gentle-
man who had visited at the house; but she
doggedly asserted her entire ignorance re-
specting his rank in life, or connections, and
pertinaciously maintained that the lady's
death had been her own voluntary act, and
that the sleeping potion had been given to
the boy by his mother’s own imperative or-
ders, as she did not herself know even what
it contained.

During a long and anxious consultation of
the jury, there was a hushed and intense si-
lence in the crowded court, so still and un-
broken, that the breathing of an infant would
have been audible, while every eye perused
the countenance of the prisoner, with an in-
tensity that brought a hectic flush, burning
like fire, upon her cheek, and she gazed

112 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

around with a glance of anger that caused
her beauty for the moment to look like that
of a fiend or a fury.

At length, after arduously serutinising every
atom of evidence that could be gathered, the
jury, though morally certain of the prisoner's
being an accomplice in the crime, felt unwill-
ingly obliged to bring in a verdict of “ not
proven,” and she was immediately liberated,
after which, amidst the yells, jeers, and exe-
crations of the populace, who were convinced
of her criminality, she hurried from the court,
and was seen no more.

Nothing is half so attractive as a mystery,
and many crowded at first, with a tempo-
vary enthusiasm, to see the beautiful boy, so
strangely bereaved, and so cruelly abandon-
ed; but the interest and excitement of hear-
ing and relating his story were soon super-
seded by greater wonders and fresher news.
In a world where all are rushing on headlong
in pursuit of novelty, and where events, great
or small, are speedily hurried into one com-
mon oblivion, people were tired at last of think-

ing or talking about young Henry and his
concerns.

Every one of the Admiral’s friends hinted
that he could have managed the whole affair
ten times better than Sir Arthur; all blam-
ed him for many things, and praised him
for very few; the Admiral was wondered. at,
criticised, discussed, admired, pitied, and cen-
sured, more than he remembered to have been
for many years before; and the givers of ad-
vice were lavish of propositions and objec-
tions, all which were borne by their venerable
friend with good-humoured indifference, whe-
ther adopted or not. At length several per-
fectly new murders from London came on the
tapis in society; those who liked reading in
the Jack Sheppard style were satiated with
studies from the life; the Morning Post as-
sumed a terrifying interest; and the lady of
fashion who consulted Sir Henry Halford
about her appetite, because she could no
longer enjoy her murders and robberies at
breakfast, would have thought, when they
were coming out hot and hot every week, that

L14 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

it was a wearisome repetition to speculate an-
other hour upon a murder nearly a month old.

In short, “ the Portobello story” ceased
to be told or listened to. Henry had had his
day. There is no such thing now as a nine
days’ wonder, because nothing lasts so long.
Young De Lancey had been talked of as much
as any reasonable being could expect to be
talked of; and now it was universally voted a
bore whenever the subject occurred in con-
yersation; for, as Lady Towercliffe remarked,
with a very long-drawn yawn, when, for the
last time, it was alluded to in her presence,
“Tt was a shocking, barbarous, and really
startling affair; but all stories should be al-
lowed to die out like an echo, which grows
fainter and fainter at every repetition. One
cannot be for ever talking of the same thing.”

‘When Henry De Lancey lost one parent, he
certainly gained another in Sir Arthur, who
often afterwards remarked, that in no instance
could virtue be more obviously its own re-
ward, than in the case of any kindness he had
shewn to this fascinating boy, whose gay joy-

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 115

ous spirits became a source of perpetual amuse-
ment to him, while the Admiral seemed to
derive new life from watching the frolicsome
gambols of his young companion, occasionally
enlivened by the gleeful vivacity of his niece
Marion, when she escaped a single day from
the trammels of school, bringing generally in
her train two of her favourite juvenile com-
panions, Clara Granville and Caroline Smythe,
both several years older than herself.

On many occasions the sensibility of Henry
De Lancey seemed already to have attained
almost the depth and intensity of manhood,
so strong wero the bursts of natural feeling
with which he occasionally spoke or acted,
while it was deeply affecting to trace through-
out the extraordinary progress thus early
made in his education, the careful culture
given to his remarkable abilities—the pains
bestowed by his solitary parent to strengthen
his mind for future difficulties and sorrows,
the earliest and worst of which she could so
little have foreseen or apprehended.

With considerable thoughtfulness of cha-

116 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

racter, however, and natural integrity of mind,
which Sir Arthur was delighted from the first
to remark, yet, when the merry group of
young friends assembled together on the
shore at Portobello, building houses of sand,
or running eagerly in search of shells, it would
have been difficult to say which was the most
carelessly happy, while the Admiral seemed
to borrow their young spirits for the time,
and gazed with ceaseless delight on those
joyous countenances, radiant with laughter
and smiles, which were archly turned towards
their aged playmate, sometimes with a chal-
lenge to run after them, or lighted up with
smiles of affection when they brought him a
bouquet of his favourite flowers, torn roughly
from the stems, and crushed and crumpled in
their little hands.

Sir Arthur often seemed almost ashamed
to betray the engrossing interest and delight
he felt in his young companion, who gained
every day a stronger hold upon his affections,
and it appeared as if he were anxious to for-
get that a time had ever existed when the

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 7

playful and interesting boy was unknown to
his heart; but a circumstance occurred, not
long after Henry’s adoption, which brought
painfully to mind, with greatly increased soli-
citude, the fearful mystery that hung over his
origin, proving also that danger still threaten-
ed him from some unforeseen quarter.

While the whole party of his young guests
were noisily engaged on the shore in a game
at hide-and-seek, one day in the month of
July, Sir Arthur had seated himself on a
bench within sight of them, sometimes watch-
ing their gambols with pleasure, and frequent-
ly conning over a newspaper, which proved by
undeniable and satisfactory demonstration,
that the country was entirely ruined—that
the Government was coming to an end—that
the Houses of Lords and Commons would be
completely demolished—that the ministry had
not another day to exist—and, as a grand
climax, that anarchy, confusion, bankruptcy,
and revolution, were about finally to drop
their extinguisher over Great Britain, Sir
Arthur had read the same thing in different

118 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

words every day during fifty years, and under
twenty varied administrations; yet still the
wonder grew, how a constitution so misma-
naged could so long survive, and that when
all was wrong at the head of the country, it
still had a leg to stand on. The Admiral’s
patriotic meditations had been several times
interrupted by repeated complaints from the
little girls, that Henry had hid himself so well,
they could not possibly find him; but he was
too much pre-oceupied to give the subject
much attention, till at length Martin an-
nounced that the children’s dinner had waited
some time, and that still the boy was not to
be found, though his companions had been
searching for him at least half an hour.

Upon hearing this, Sir Arthur hastily
started up, making a considerable expendi-
ture of energetic and wondrous exclamations,
while he gazed around with increasing sur-
prise at the wide waste of sand, like an Ara-
bian desert, with which he was on every side
encompassed, and where it seemed to him as
if a mouse could not be long concealed.

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 119

A hasty and most anxious search was in-
stantly commenced in the garden, while Sir
Arthur and Martin shouted the name of
Henry at the full pitch of their voices, but in
vain; not a sound was heard in reply, nor
was there a spot unexamined in which he
could by possibility be lurking.

The Admiral now became seriously alarmed
at so unaccountable a disappearance, especial-
ly when the child’s gardening tools, with which
he had been last observed, were found muti-
lated and broken, at a great distance, on the
beach—one of his shoes had fallen off close to
the water—and his hat lay nearly buried in
the tide. Sir Arthur instantly summoned the
police to his aid, but the search continued
fruitless, till at length the dreadful conjecture
became more and more probable, that Henry
must have rashly ventured into the water,
and been washed away by the waves—in pur-
suance of which apprehension Sir Arthur
summoned more assistance, that the water
might instantly be dragged.

120 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

Martin, meantime, no less active than his
master, had accidentally met a stranger on
the beach, who mentioned, on hearing of his
alarm, that on the road to Leith, half an hour
before, he had observed a boy struggling and
screaming in the arms of a female, dressed
like a nursery-maid, who complained loudly
that the child would not go home, when a
young man, rather strangely dressed, and of
very singular appearance, had instantly offer-
ed his assistance, and carried him forcibly on-
wards, This gentleman said he had stopped
the woman to remonstrate with her on using
the boy so roughly, as a cap was drawn over
his eyes, and he seemed to suffer agonies of
terror, sobbing convulsively, and trembling in
every limb; but the man had answered in
reply, with a strong Irish accent, that he
would see the child safe to his friends, and let
no one do the poor boy “a taste of harm.”
The stranger added indifferently, that it was
no affair of his, therefore he ceased to inter-
fere; but he thought both the man and the

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 121

woman had a very bad expression, and he
would not trust either of them with his dog
for an hour, to use it kindly.

Without wasting time in returning to com-
municate what he had heard, Martin hurried
forward to Leith, where, with reckless speed
and untiring diligence, he threaded all the
narrow streets, and elbowed his way among
carts, carriages, parcels, and passengers, till
at length he reached the pier, to which he
had been so eagerly aiming his steps. At its
farthest point stood a smoking steam-boat in
full boil, while men and women, boxes, pack-
ages, bags, and trunks, were pouring in, and
at length, as he breathlessly approached with-
in some hundred yards, an arbitrary little bell
was rung, to summon stragglers on board,
and to hurry stragglers away.

A single plank, connecting the steam-boat
with the pier, was on the point of being with-
drawn, when.Martin approached; and while
he paused, in momentary hesitation whether
to pursue his almost hopeless search, the

steward peremptorily desired him to hasten
‘VOL. I. FP

122 MODERN FLIRTA'TIONS.

on board instantly, if he were coming at all,
as not a moment more could be lost.

At this moment a cry, almost amounting
to a scream of childish joy, became audible on
the deck—a young boy was seen vehemently
struggling in the arms of a female; and in an
instant, pursued by a man who vainly endea-
youred to overtake him, he rushed past the
steward, ran across the temporary bridge, and
clasped Martin round the knees, exclaiming,
with eager incoherent exclamations of almost
hysterical delight, “ Take me, Martin! take
me! O let me go home to Sir Arthur! I did
not come away without leave! I did not in-
deed! That naughty horrid woman forced
me! She tied a cap over my face, and would
not let me go back! I have been go frighten-
ed and so sorry,” added the child, bursting
into tears, and sobbing as if his heart would
break; “ I thought Sir Arthur would be
angry, and I thought, perhaps, I would never
see him again! O take mé home, Martin!
take me home! and let me never see :these
people again !”

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 123

The boy put his hand, with an air of happy
confidence and security, into that of Martin,
who snatched him: up in his arms, with a
thousand expressions of joyful surprisd; but,
a moment afterwards, when he. recollected
himself, his first. impulse was to secure: the
culprits who had decoyed Henry away, and
to deliver them up to a magistrate for exami-
nation. With this intention, he looked has-
tily round, intending to cause their immediate
apprehension ; but the steam-boat. had sailed
off; and all.the gesticulations he could make
to bring them back, only caused the steward
laughingly to shake his shead, thinking that
Martin had merely missed his passage, as he
deserved, for not showing more alacrity in
obeying his injunctions to embark. y

At Portobello, meantime, Sir; Arthur had
suffered agonies of grief, and: even of self-re-
proach, thinking he had too securely relied
on the safety of his young protégé ; and with
a heavy heart he was still directing his steps,
and conducting his assistants to.the most pro-
bable places for finding the child’s body, hav-

124 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

ing already ordered his maid to have every
thing in readiness, in case a chance remained
of his being restored to life, when he felt a
gentle pull at the skirt of his coat, and, on
looking down, he uttered a volley of joyful
exclamations, on beholding the radiant coun-
tenance of Henry, whom he clasped in his
arms with unutterable joy. While Martin
and the boy himself, gave each his own his-
tory of the strange adventure, Sir Arthur
walked up and down in a state of irrepressi-
ble irritation, clenching his teeth, and grasp-
ing his walking-stick firmly in his hand, as if
about to wreak instant vengeance on the mis-
ereants. At length, after exhausting his in-
dignation, he took Henry again in his arms,
declaring he would never for a moment lose
sight of him again.

Nothing in Henry’s narrative threw the
smallest gleam of light on the plans or inten-
tions of the strange man and woman, which
seemed destined to'remain buried in impene-
trable obscurity. They had evidently been
accomplices in decoying him from home; and

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 125

the boy had brought away from the steam-
boat, a small book which they had given
him, full of ribald songs, and profane jests,
but covered with magnificent boards, and
clasped with silver hinges, which seemed to
have once belonged to some ancient missal,
and still retained in the inside, a collection of
texts beautifully written in a very remarkable
hand, which seemed to be that of a highly-
educated female.

For some time afterwards, several suspi-
cious-looking people were seen lurking about
Sir Arthur's premises, late at night ; and one
evening a shot was fired suddenly in at the
drawing-room window, which passed so near
to Henry’s head, that his hair was actually
disturbed; but though an active police had
been placed on the watch, not’ a trace could
be obtained of the authors of this outrage.

As time wore on, and the mind of Henry
rapidly expanded on all subjects of classical
learning and general science, the fearful and
melancholy events of his early years faded
considerably from his mind, while he made

126 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

astonishing progress at the excellent school
where Sir Arthur-placed him, exhibiting that
happy, but rare combination of deep thought,
and refinement of mind, with extreme liveli-
liness of fancy, and enthusiasm of character.
This threw a perfect witchery over his con-
versation, which sparkled with vivacity, or
flowed with uncommon depth and power, as
best suited the occasion, while at the same
time, during his intercourse with Sir Arthur,
he became imbued with the highest princi-
ples of honour and good feeling; and from
his master he imbibed the most enlightened
knowledge of the doctrines and duties of
Christianity, with the profoundest reverence
for its precepts and practice.

Sir Arthur felt a dreary blank during
Henry’s absence at school, which became
more and more intolerable as his eyesight
was at length nearly extinct ; and he had se-
rious thoughts of engaging a person to walk
out with him during the day, and to read
to him during the evening, being of opinion
that it is the highest wisdom, as well as the

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 127

best Christianity, cheerfully to meet every ap-
pointed privation, and derive from: the. bless-
ings that remain, as much enjoyment as they
can afford.

Sir Arthur often remarked’ to his friend,
Lady Towercliffe, that it is a misfortune to
wear out a taste for any inoffensive oecupa-
tion; and he began to fear it might be pos-
sible for him to survive his enjoyment of
reading. “In my long life,” he observed,
“T have myself travelled all the travels de-
seribed by others, thought all the thoughts,
and felt all the feelings. If I read such a
book as Robertson’s America, for instance,
the question forces itself| upon me, ‘ what the
better would I be of knowing this whole vo-
lume by heart!’ The time was once, when a
romance carried me off into another existence
altogether, and I seemed to awaken as from
a dream, when called back to the ordinary
business of life; but now I can anticipate
from the first page, the whole denouement of
every novel, and never for an instant forget
my own identity in reading the story.”

128 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

“Tt is a shocking symptom of advancing
years,” said Lady Towercliffe. “But you
must wait till I publish.”

“Yet,” continued Sir Arthur, “ there is
one volume always new, in which I never can
tire of reading my own heart and character ;
and in the Bible, the descriptions of eastern
countries are so like what I have observed
myself of the scenery, customs, and manners,
that they fill me with recollections and asso-
ciations that are of endless interest.”

No sooner had Sir Arthur mentioned in-
cidentally, to Lady Towercliffe, and several
friends, that he would willingly give a hand-
some salary to a person of good reading and
writing abilities, than it seemed as if all the
meritorious young men in Scotland happened
at that very time to be looking out for pre-
cisely such a situation; and it made Sir
Arthur almost melancholy in examining tes-
timonials, which ought to have procured
any one of them a bishopric, to think that
so many admirable youths, of learning and
talents, were ready to sacrifice themselves

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 129

for a mere home, and a pittance of L.50 per
annum !

No situation ever became vacant in the
memory of man, for which Lady Towereliffe
had not some protégé exactly suited; and no
sooner did she hear that Sir Arthur required
a secretary and reader, than she wrote him a
note of seven pages, closely penned, in which
she made it evident that there was but one
individual in the world who could suit, or
ought to suit, and that one individual was
the bearer of her despatch, who waited below
for an answer.

It appeared that, with all her zeal in the
cause, Lady Towercliffe knew very little of
the young man she so vehemently recom-
mended ; but having accidentally met him in
a bookseller’s shop, he had been employed by
her to copy some verses in an album, and she
thought him, without exception, one of the
most civil and grateful creatures in the world,
who really deserved encouragement.

When Sir Arthur sent for Mr Howard up
stairs, his kind heart was almost shocked at

180 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

the tone of wild energy, and the look of fe-
verish anxiety with which he entreated that
his capabilities might be tried. His figure,
though youthful, was tall, gaunt, and meagre,
while his care-worn countenance, which bore
a stern and melancholy aspect, was lighted
up by large dark flashing eyes, in which there
gleamed an expression of singular excitement.
He appeared young and handsome, but not
prepossessing—so gloomy and determined was
the expression of his firmly-compressed mouth,
that it seemed almost indicative of ferocity ;
and his eye had that peculiarity invariably
expressing evil—an impossibility of looking
any one steadily in the face.

“You see me under great disadvantage,
Sir Arthur; friendless, homeless, and pover-
ty-struck,” said Mr Howard, with a look of
eager, deprecating solicitude, which spoke at
once to the generous heart of the Admiral,
and filled him with commiseration. ‘“ Fate
and fortune have hitherto frustrated my ef-
forts, and weighed me down with life-erush-
ing sorrows; but only give me employment,

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 131

and I would not thank the Queen to be my
cousin !”

It was a favourite saying with Sir Arthur,
that he would be more ashamed to suspect
mankind, than to be deceived by them; and
if he had a weakness in the world, it was a
total ineapacity to give pain. Touched by
the nervous excitement in Mr Howard’s eye
and manner, which he attributed entirely to
his necessitous circumstances, he almost im-
mediately engaged him, to the entire satisfac-
tion of Lady Towercliffe, who never asked or
cared any more about her protégé, gratified
that she had achieved “a job,” and that by
her interest, and hers only, a place in the
world had been filled up, which would have been
occupied by some one else, perhaps equally
deserving, if she had not interfered, and she
was satisfied for the present, to have been of
consequence to somebody, no matter whom.

Mr Howard generally spoke in a subdued,
mysterious voice, as if afraid to let himself
Imow what he was saying; yet sometimes his
words came forth with a rushing impetuosity,

132 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

full of energy and fire, like lightning itself.
His hollow, blood-shot eyes, betrayed a wild,
watchful, suspicious expression, by no means
prepossessing ; and there was something in-
serutable in the bland, perpetual smile he
always wore upon his countenanee, and in the
frozen tranquillity of his manner, which occa-
sionally, though seldom, gave way to bursts
of tempestuous emotion. The very pupils of
his eyes seemed to become darker, with a
fearfully wild and ferocious expression when
irritated, while the fierce fire flashed out from
beneath his lowering brows, with a blaze of
inexpressible fury ; yet ina moment he could
command himself again into a cold, calm, and
almost haughty exterior, while the spectral
paleness of his handsome countenance, made
him look like marble itself.

Years passed on, during which Sir Arthur
endured, rather than enjoyed, Mr Howard’s
attendance, whose pre-occupied air and vague
manner, continually annoyed him; but his be-
nevolent heart shrunk from consigning the
poor man to that hopeless and solitary want

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 133

which he seemed to apprehend must inevitably
follow the loss of his present situation, and
from day to day he postponed the decision,
till habit grew into second nature, and he be-
came so accustomed to hear “ The Times,”
column after column, spouted forth in a rather
theatrical tone by his reader, and to dictate
notes and letters to his very silent and dili-
gent secretary, that he almost forgot at last
to think of parting with him.

When Henry returned for the first time
from school, six or.seven months after Mr
Howard had become domesticated at Porto-
bello, the secretary professed a vehement
fancy for the boy, would fetch and carry for
him like a tame dog, and loaded him with
attentions; yet, though in general most affec-
tionately grateful. to all who showed him
even a trifling kindness, these assiduities and
flatteries were lavished upon him in vain.
The boy shrunk instinctively from Mr How-
ard’s notice, but could assign no other reason
to himself or to others for this apparently un-
reasonable antipathy, except merely that the

134 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

stranger resembled somebody he had seen
before, but how, when, or where, not a trace
remained in his memory. This little caprice
did not appear to be noticed or resented by
the secretary, till one day, when Henry re-
fused some bon-bons which Mr Howard offer-
ed him, saying, the last he accepted had made
him sick, and when the boy soon after flew
gayly out of the room, Marion was for a mo-
ment startled and surprised to observe the
malignant scowl with which the eye of Mr
Howard followed Henry. It was a glance, fell
and malignant, that feared to be seen, while
his cheek became pale as death, but whether
in anger or in sorrow, Marion thought it im-
possible to divine.

As Henry grew older, his instinctive dread
of Mr Howard seemed only to increase, but
he was too considerate to disturb the tran-

after many years of such prudent self-restraint.

when nearly grown up to manhood, he could
not help saying one day, in a careless tone, to
the Admiral, after witnessing a sudden out-
break’ of temper in Mr Howard that morn-
ing,

“ Your secretary always reminds me, Sir
Arthur, of Sinbad’s Old Man of the Sea. It
seems impossible to get handsomely rid of
him, and he will never certainly make a volun-
tary departure !”

“T fear not!” replied the Admiral, with
something between a smile and a sigh. “He
does all I desire him, but without interest or
pleasure, and he has the most undisguised con-
tempt for every living being, almost amount-
ing to hatred, yet he expresses unbounded
gratitude for being harboured in my house.
What can I do? It would be cruel to kick
the man out of doors, merely because he is
unhappy; but I have often: observed, Henry,
that he is no favourite of yours, though. that
is the only subject on which you have never
been entirely open with me.”

“ Because I am heartily ashamed of my

136 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

feelings, Sir Arthur, and you are the last per-
son on earth to whom I wish to tell anything
against myself. You have told me there are
people with a loathing antipathy to cats, and
somewhat similar is the shuddering sensation
with which I see your worthy secretary enter
the room. <A sort of shiver comes over me,
and a wish to keep him off,—to avoid his very
glance and touch. He has a strange under-
look certainly ! His smile makes me shudder !
and yet the feeling is quite undefinable ! They
say dogs and children have an instinctive lik-
ing or antipathy to those who secretly like or
hate them, and perhaps my sensation is on
somewhat similar grounds.

“ There is something fearful in the eye of
Mr Howard, occasionally, when I catch it
fixed upon myself,” added Henry rapidly, but
in a sort of musing absent under-tone, while
his voice acquired a deeper tinge of thought,
“T seem to have beheld him once in a dream!
When he looks at me in that strange and ex-
traordinary manner, his eyes like the flicker-
ing glare of light in a gloomy cavern, I feel

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 137

and know that at some period in my life I
have seen such a countenance before! The
time and place have escaped me, but the re-
membrance is painful, and in his presence I
cannot but be convinced that I am in the
presence of an enemy. It is a feeling I can
neither drive away, nor distinctly realize !”
“Why did you never tell me this before
Henry?” asked the Admiral, rising with agi-
tation. ‘“ He has been hardly dealt with by
fortune, but surely you do not think ——

“ Think! ! 3 I think nothing, Sir
Arthur, for I know nothing, and I ought not
to have spoken as I have done,—it was wrong
and rash. I shall try to conquer this,—to

 

conquer myself,—and, as they say, acquired
tastes are always the strongest, I may yet
learn to like Mr Howard better than any one
living; but, in the mean time, Sir Arthur, he
does oceasionally look to me, very like some
stray member of the Lunatic Asylum !”

“T sometimes think,” said Sir Arthur,
“that Howard has a bee in his bonnet.”

138 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

“ He has a whole hive of bees in his bon-
net!” replied Henry in his usual: off-hand
tone; but when he looked round, as is usual,
when people are spoken of, the individual
himself, Mr Howard, stood before him. A
mortal paleness had overspread his counte-
tenance, contending emotions seemed flitting
across his lowering brow, like shifting clouds
in a threatening sky, and his eyes gleamed
upon young De Lancey with a look of maniacal
fury; but the same artificial smile was on his
lips which he habitually assumed, while, in the
blandest voice of courtesy he turned from the
steady penetrating gaze of Henry to Sir Ar-
thur, saying, in a tone of servile cunning, but
with a smile the most ghastly that was ever
seen on a human face,

“ Every fool can find fault, but my live-
lihood fortunately depends not on any boyish
caprice. It is derived from the generosity
of a noble mind, unbiassed by cruel and
unfounded prejudices, which may, however,
yet be my ruin. A small leak sinks a great
ship, and even you, my benefactor, may

hereafter be influenced by the opinion of
one who avowedly hates me, though without
cause,—I should have little to dread if he
were like you, but then who is? Come what
may, however, you deserve and shall ever re-
tain my undying gratitude and attachment.
I have met with little kindness in life, and
am never likely to forget that little, from
whatever benevolent heart it comes. In this
bleak, desolate, most harsh and cruel world,
you-are now my only friend.”

“Those who: have deserved friends, Mr
Howard, are seldom so entirely destitute of
them!” said Sir Arthur, with a certain tone
of interrogation in his voice, for he abhorred
the slightest approach to flattery, and always
had an instinctive apprehension that it was
accompanied by deceit. ‘“ We are too ready
often: to throw the blame upon human nature,
when our own individual nature is to blame.
For my own part, I have met with little un-
kindness or ingratitude hitherto, and would
willingly look upon the sunny side of life,
hoping all things, and believing all things, of

140 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

mankind in general, and of yourself among the
number.”

The darkened sight of Sir Arthur prevent-
ed his perceiving that in the countenance of
Mr Howard there flitted a quick succession
of emotions, fiery and vivid as summer light-
ning, but Henry observed with astonishment
the powerful though ineffectual efforts he
made to control his agitation. His hands
were clenched, till the very blood seemed
ready to spring; he gnawed his nether lip
with frightful vehemence, and his eyes shot
fire from beneath his dark and frowning brow.
With a glance of unspeakable malevolence at
Henry, and a hurried bow to Sir Arthur, he
hastened with rapid steps out of the room,
and subsequently out of the house.

“Tf there be a madman out of bedlam, Sir
Arthur, that is he!” exclaimed Henry, fol-
lowing with his eyes the rushing steps of
Howard, as he crossed the garden. “ Before
I go to college, let me hope you will dismiss
him. Give the poor man a trifling pension,
or do any thing for him, rather than trust

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 141

yourself in his hands, for I am mistaken, in-
deed, if he is not a bad and dangerous man.”

“ Before you return here, I may perhaps
be able to find some other situation for him ;
but he has done nothing yet, Henry, to for-
feit my protection, and I scarcely think he
would live, if I dismissed him. He has drunk
a bitter cup of. wretchedness, and without
principle or hope, he has more than hinted to
me, that death itself will be his resource if I
turn him adrift. It was a well-meant offi-
ciousness of Lady Towercliffe to force him
upon my good offices, and I cannot yet see
any easy way to relieve myself of the charge,
without causing more distress than I can re-
concile myself to occasioning.”

“ He is certainly a strange mysterious be-
ing,” replied Henry, wishing to turn off a sub-
ject which he saw was agitating Sir Arthur
with perplexity; “but Mr Howard is not
probably the only man on earth whom in the
course of my existence I shall not be able to
comprehend.”

CHAPTER VI.

She was a phantom of delight,

When first she gleam’d upon my sight,
A lovely apparition sent,

‘To be a moment’s ornament ;

Her eyes as stars of twilight fair,

Like twilight too her dusky hair,

But all things else about her drawn,
From May-time, and the cheerful dawn,
A dancing shape, an image gay,

To haunt, to startle, and way-lay.

Tue most popular girl at. Mrs Penfold’s “ Se-
minary for Young Ladies,” near Edinburgh,
was Marion Dunbar, too much loved by her
companions to be envied; admired by all,
and almost idolized by each, while beneath
the gay, sparkling surface of her joyous dis-
position, there rolled on a warm current of

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 143

sensibility and feeling sufficient to repay, and
more than repay, all the deep tenderness and
enthusiastic affection she excited among the
little circle of her young and ardent friends.

Cast in the finest mould of classical beauty,
and formed mentally as well as personally in
the very poetry of nature, the perfect grace
and symmetry of her features became en-
livened frequently by an arch and radiant
smile, like a Hebe, glowing with the richest
hues of health and joy. Her splendid eyes
sparkled with every passing emotion, some-
times dimmed for a moment by tears of sensi-
bility, but usually glittering with smiles, while
occasionally, when amused or delighted, she
burst into a comic elfish laugh, the very es-
sence of glee and joyousness,—a most en-
livening accompaniment to what she said,
while her conversation, always fresh and un-
premeditated, rushed straight from her heart,
fresh and natural as a mountain stream.

The colour of a violet was not more deeply
blue than the dark unfathomable eyes of
Marion, shaded by a fringe of eye-lashes that

144 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

might have been mistaken for black. No de-
seription could do justice to the fascination of
her smile, without one shade of affectation,
while her pure transparent complexion, fresh
as a bouquet of roses, took a richer tint from
all the flitting emotions which chased each
other through her mind. A rich profusion of
nut-brown hair played around her high areh-
ed forehead of alabaster whiteness, and a
thousand laughing dimples quivered around
her delicately-formed mouth, giving her a
merry, joyous look of girlish beauty, varied
oceasionally by a melting softness of expres-
sion when she looked in any countenance that
she loved. On one occasion, a celebrated
sculptor asked Sir Patrick’s permission to
take a cast of Marion’s head, and on obtain-
ing the desired permission, he observed, that
if those features could be turned into marble,
he would stake his whole fame on the impos-
sibility of any critic pointing out a single de-
fect. But while admiration is given by the
eye of an artist merely to symmetry, expres-
sion is the mystery of beauty; and the charm

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 145

of Marion, in the estimation of her friends,
was, that her face seemed like a mirror
formed to reflect every emotion of their own
hearts.

The, most stern and morose of human be-
ings must have been conciliated into some de-
gree of regard, by the deep tenderness of a
character “ without one jarring atom form’d,”
which seemed made only to love and to be
loved. While her gay fancy revelled in
“ cheerful yesterdays and confident to-mor-
rows,” the flowers that grew around her path,
the birds that sang as she passed, the very
turf beneath her feet, and the sky above her
head, called forth her feelings. She had a
tear to spare for the sorrows of every one who
claimed her sympathy, and a ready smile for
the joys of all her companions, while yet a
great deal of unoccupied love remained at
her disposal, the chief portion of which was
bestowed with prodigal enthusiasm on her in-
dulgent uncle Sir Arthur, whose doting af-
fection would have spoiled any other disposi-

tion, but only rendered her more keenly de-
VoL. I. «

146 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

sirous to merit, and to preserve his par-
tiality.

In the estimation of Sir Arthur, his “little
Marion” never became a day older, and he
considered her a perfect prodigy in every
thing she said or did, watching all her words,
and entering into all her juvenile feelings
with a versatility of mind astonishing at his
advanced age. Nothing on earth is more
touching than to see the warmth of sensibi-
lity and enthusiasm yet surviving the chill of
many a year in this disappointing and sor-
rowful world; but there was a degree of mu-
tual confidence between Sir Arthur and his
young niece, which ean seldom exist with a
disparity of years and circumstances. Be-
sides all her feminine gentleness, and almost
poetical gracefulness of character, Marion yet
displayed at times a power of intellect, and
an energetic strength of character, for which
a superficial observer would have been totally
unprepared; for her mind seemed always to
rise in proportion to the occasion, while, she
had been born apparently to practise without

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 147

reserve, that beautiful, Christian rule, for
each individual always to consider himself
last. Rarely are deep feelings, and. in-
tense sensibility united with that high in-
telligence of mind, and that vivid gladness of
spirit peculiar to Marion; butithe stream of
her mind was deep as well as sparkling, while
during her early years sorrow flitted through
her cheerful, laughter-loving mind, like the
shadow of a butterfly in a bright sunny
flower-bed. Pleased “she knew not why,
and car’d not wherefore,” there was a pecu-
liar grace in all she did, and an infectious
merriment in all she said, which attracted a
joyous group of gay companions continually
around her, on whom the light of her own
buoyant vivacity seemed to be continually
and brightly reflected.

Nothing could be more pleasing and char-
acteristic than, to observe the refined in-
genuity with which, from the earliest age,
Marion tried to evade receiving the multi-
tude of little presents with which it was Sir
Arthur's delight to surprise her. Trinkets

148 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

and toys would have multiplied around her, if
she had not frequently made an ostentation
of possessing more than it was possible for
her to use, and when Sir Arthur allowed her
a choice, in any gift he was about to force
on her acceptance, she invariably selected
that which seemed least expensive; and her
uncle afterwards told, that when, on the
twelfth anniversary of her birth-day, he clasp-
ed a beautiful Maltese chain round her neck,
she said to him with a deepening colour and
faltering voice, “ I would like better to
love you for nothing, uncle Arthur! My
drawer up stairs is like a jeweller’s shop
already. You know I inherited half dear
mamma’s ornaments, and Patrick says you
bring Rundell and Bridge in your pocket
every time I have a holiday, but I would be
quite as happy to see you all for yourself.”
The merry-eyed Marion seemed to “ wear
her heart upon her sleeve,” and to see only
what was best in all those with whom she
associated. With her small means, it was
truly astonishing how frequently and ingeni-

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 149

ously she invented some unobtrusive way of
conferring a favour on her companions, as if
she were receiving rather than bestowing one,
and it certainly appeared as if she scarcely
knew the difference. There was not an in-
dividual among her numerous young contem-
poraries, who did not often relate traits of
goodness in one whom they always found
ready to answer the largest drafts that could
be drawn upon her good offices, while the
cheerfulness of her mind reflected itself on all.

If one of her young friends rushed joyously
forward to announce some unexpected success,
Marion’s features seemed as if they had been
put together only for smiles and laughter,
while her bright eye glittered with instant
gladness, and a glow of colour mounted to
her dimpling cheek, as she felt and expressed
with spontaneous warmth all that kindness
could dictate, but if
some unforeseen affliction visited the hearts
of her juvenile associates, there seemed no
limits to the patience with which she listened
to their complaints, or to the eager assiduity

and more ;

 

 

150 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

with which she endeavoured to alleviate their
sorrow. The most trifling attentions she
never overlooked, were it merely the tying of
a string, or the picking up of a handkerchief,
which she did with a good-humoured grace
all her own, and the trifling actions of life are
those by which the character can generally be
most justly appreciated. Great achievements
are a conspicuous embroidery laid on the sur-
face often for effect, but the ground-work and
material are formed of what is most unobtru-
sive and often scarcely noticed. With Marion,
every kind and generous feeling was as natural
as perfume to the violet, and equally insepar-
able from her daily existence; her ideas
were fresh and vivid, while her manner was
thoroughly fascinating and thoroughly femi-
nine, at the same time that all the grace of
look and expression added a surpassing charm
to her lively and intelligent conversation, every
word of which sprang from the spontaneous
impulse of a heart full of natural emotion and
straightforward sentiments.

Many a difficult exercise she had secretly

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 151

assisted to write for her young contempor-
aries, many an unintelligible drawing she had
touched up, many a dress she had privately
mended, many a little debt she had clandes-
tinely paid for her juvenile friends, and far
from wishing to be thanked, she shrunk with
modest sensibility from letting her’ services be
over-estimated, even by those whom she had
most exerted herself to oblige. Whenever a
kindness had been privately done at school,
the author of which could not be ‘guessed
at nor discovered, few hesitated to declare
that it must have proceeded from Marion
Dunbar, and none were ever mistaken in say-
ing so.

It was indeed wonderful that the lovely
and gay young school-girl found time for a
tenth part of her kind and tender affections,
at Mrs Penfold’s first-rate seminary for what
Sir Arthur called “ fiddlefaddle education.”
There no taste was ineulcated for quiet’ pur-
suits or domestic intercourse, and it was one
of Mrs Penfold’s favourite axioms, that nature
is always vulgar; but in her zeal for the ho-

152 MODERN FLIRTATIONS,

nour of her establishment she seemed resolute
to mako every pupil an Admirable Crichton,
—or more,—not in studying the experience

 

of past ages, and reading the thoughts and
feelings which have been recorded for their
instruction by millions of the best and wisest
of their predecessors in life, but in all the
frivolities of existence; and to this end the
pupils were stinted in sleep and food, while
they pursued a course of application more
incessant, though not so profound, as that
of students for a doublo first class at Ox-
ford, Tho most eminent masters were in
hourly attendance to cultivate every thing
but the heart or under

  

nding. The various
arts of killing or of wasting time were taught
in perfeetion, by the best, or at least by the
most fashionable teachers ; and, as the Admi-
ral disapprovingly remarked to her brother,
“Tittle Marion was surrounded by professors
of every thing on earth,—by professors of
trumpery in all its branches, but by no profes-
sors of common sense !”

With Mrs Penfold each pupil was a favou-

 

 

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 153

rite in exact proportion as she appeared likely
to acquire a talent for the difficult art of ris
ing in the world, by which she might reflect
eredit and celebrity on the theatre of her edu-
cation; and it seemed, therefore, by no means
intended as an expression of kindness, when
that lady was heard one day impatiently to
exclaim in accents of reproach, “ Marion
Dunbar is all heart and no head! Some girls
do nothing, but she does less than nothing ;
and though she gets on in years, she gets on
in no other thing !”

Wearily busied in being taught, Marion
yet felt that there was one incitement, and
one only, which made every effort a pleasure,
while it gave life to the dull routine of her
heartless labours, and that incitement was her
fervent, incessant desire to please, not the
dictate of vanity, but of spontaneous sensibi-
lity; and while, with her bright and beaming
looks, she was by no means a prodigy, Marion
very much under-rated her own powers, be
lieving, in the simplicity of her-heart, that
she really was the most hopeless dunce on

J

154 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

many subjects, only able to recommend her-
self by diligence and by alacrity to oblige.
Even Mrs Penfold was disarmed of half
her severity, by the eagerness with which
Marion, buoyant with youth, and joyous as a
bird on wing, undertook any task, or suffered
any penance to compensate for such little
etourderies as had caused her to be in tempo-
vary disgrace; and the stern schoolmistress
herself could not but smile sometimes in the
midst of her gravest lecture, to observe the
look of extreme anxiety and self-reproach with
which Marion listened to the catalogue of her
small indiseretions, and the grateful joy with
which she heard that there were any terms
on which she might yet be restored to favour.
Caroline Smythe, her most froliesome com-
panion, frequently amused herself by invent-
ing imaginary scrapes into which Marion was
supposed to have fallen, and by sending her
express to Mrs Penfold for a reprimand,
while the lively girl watched, in laughing am-
buscade, for the bright beaming smile which
flashed into the supposed culprit’s counte-

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 1355

nance, the instant she unexpectedly found her-
self honourably acquitted.

Thus the foundation of Marion’s mind was
laid, and these were the light breezes that
ruffled the’smooth current of her life; but en-
chanted by the slightest pleasures, few ever
bore the burden of her annoyances so lightly,
while a brilliant painted curtain hung over
the future, filled with images of anticipated
joy, to be realised in all their brightness and
beauty, as soon as she became émancipated
from the dreary thraldom of Mrs Penfold’s
manufactory of young ladies.

Meantime, Marion’s mind grew and flour-
ished, like some rare and beautiful plant in-
judiciously cultivated, yet glowing in almost
unprecedented luxuriance. Plunged in this
inextricable labyrinth of educational troubles,
she had to undergo lessons from sun-rise till
sun-set, while all the varied arts, ‘sciences,
and languages were piled promiscuously on
her brain, like an ill-grown coppice, distorted
and stunted for want of more judicious thin-
ning and training. She could name things in

156 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

every language, but was told nothing of their
nature and properties; while, as Sir Arthur
complained, “ poor little Marion was taught
plenty of sound, but no sound sense, except
what she had inherited by nature, without
paying £100 a-year for it.”

Jn music Marion displayed great taste and
expression, while her flexible, richly-toned
voice poured out sometimes a flood of har-
mony most exquisite to hear, as the pathos of
her full round intonations drew forth the
feeling and sympathy of all her auditors.
Expression in music is like expression of
countenance, not to be taught or acquired,
but the spontaneous result of natural emo-
tion, and with Marion musie was almost a
passion, for her whole spirit seemed instinct
with melody, while her lark-like voice trilled
its liquid notes with joyful hilarity.

Signiors and Signioras, who might have
fitted their pupils to become chorus-singers at
the opera, were multiplied around the young
ladies at Mrs Penfold’s “ College of Frivo-
lity,” followed in ceaseless succession by Mes-

 

x

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 15

sieurs and Mesdames, who taught the young
ladies to maltreat pianofortes, by playing on
them at the rate of 100 miles an hour, or to
speak foreign languages better than the na-
tives, and to write them better than they could
write their own :—

While hands, lips, and eyes were put to school,
‘And each instructed feature had its rule,

On Sunday evenings, for the sake of effect,
the girls were regularly assembled to prayers,
which were conducted like those of Frederick
the Great’s soldiers, being performed simul-
taneously at the word of command as a part
of their exercise, without a semblance of re-
yerence, and within a very limited number of
minutes, while they were hastily slurred over
by Mrs Penfold herself, with scarcely an ex-
ternal aspect of solemnity or interest. Sun-
day had long been considered by all the
pupils at Mrs Penfold’s as a privileged day
for writing letters, wearing best bonnets,
peeping from behind a red-silk curtain at the
congregation, criticising the clergyman’s man-

ner, dress, and appearance, discussing, in sup-
pressed whispers, who it would be possible or
impossible for them to think of marrying, and
enjoying rather a longer walk than common
in strolling to church and returning again.
Any knowledge of the Bible inculeated at
Mrs Penfold’s, was like all the other acquire-
ments taught in that establishment, more for
show than use. Each young pupil could re-
peat by heart, without hesitation or mistake,
the whole history of Jacob, Abraham, and
any of the patriarchs, prophets, or apostles,
and enumerate all the kings who ever reigned
over Israel, but they remained utterly unin-
structed respecting the influence which the
Divine revelation should obtain over their
own life and character, nor were they ever
taught to inquire what was their own nature,
why they were placed upon the earth, and
whither they were likely to go after this pe-
rishable world had passed from their sight.
Summer-flowers alone were implanted in their
minds, but no thoughts, hopes, or affections,
such as may last for winter wear. To them

their birth seemed merely to have been the
commencement of an existen¢e, given entirely
for their own individual pleasure or advan-
tage, which was finally to terminate at their
death.

Before Marion had been ‘long at school,
however, she formed an intimacy which pro-
duced a permanent and most happy effect on
all her subsequent life and feelings. Clara
Granvilleyseveral years older than herself, had
been nurtured, like-her brother, in holiness,
and in every domestic excellence, while she
lived only for the dictates of a chastened and
sanctified heart. Delicate in health, and fra-
gile in extreme to appearance, there was some-
thing almost seraphic in the delicate purity of
her lovely countenance, and in the tranquil
composure of her graceful manner. During a
long and tedious illness, with which Clara was
seized,’a short time before leaving school, she
testified a tender and almost exclusive affec-
tion for Marion, who spent all her leisure
hours,—or rather moments, for hours were
searce at MrsPenfold’s,—in the most assiduous

attention to the beloved invalid, and in imbib-
ing those elements of good, those feelings and
principles of religion which were to be guides
of all her future life, and thus she became,
before long, an enlightened, well informed, and
deeply pious Christian, not shrinking from the
society of one who excelled herself, but hum-
bly and gratefully seeking, on all occasions,
her advice and instruction, while both had
their hearts filled with a fervent desire, steadily
and consistently to pursue their own best. in-
terests, and an anxious wish also to succour
and benefit others, in all the troubles and
sorrows of life, though Marion was apt to feel
like the poet,

Ready to aid all beings, I would go

‘The world around to suecour human woe,

‘Yet am so largely happy, that it seems,
There are no woes, and sorrows are but dreams.

Marion’s health and spirits were refreshed
arid invigorated by frequent excursions to visit
Sir Arthur, who endeared himself to his eager
young auditors, Henry and Marion, by expa-
tiating with all the freshness of youth, to their

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 161

wondering ears, on the times long past,
when holidays, romping, sight-seeing, birth-
days, and festivals, were still in fashion, but
these were the days of his own boyhood, before
children were too wise and busy to have time
for natural enjoyment. The Admiral was
thought, by Mrs Penfold, a sad marplot, hay-
ing already, as she knew, done all in his
power to dissuade Sir Patrick from placing
the “little fairy,” as he called his favourite,
in such a tread-mill as her school-room, where
he said the only knowledge to be acquired
was, that knowledge. of the world which
ruins the heart, and where fascination was
to be taught as one of the fine arts, but all
his representations, whether in jest or in
earnest, were vain. Sir Patrick, being the
guardian of both his sisters, had determined
to expend a considerable part of the provision
bequeathed by their father in training them
up as carefully, for the course of fashionable
life, as he would have trained a promising
race-horse which was expected to win the
St Leger, confidently anticipating a short

and brilliant career of admiration and suc-
cess, ending with a splendid trousseau, a
chariot and four, and a profusion of wedding
favours.

Even the gay, froliesome Caroline Smythe,
many years older than Marion, and the most
unruly and seditious of pupils, became speedily
tamed down to mechanical obedience at school,
where, losing her naturally intense enjoy-
ment of mere existence, she seemed at best
almost-a habitual drudge in the usual routine
of labour. There was a mystery never ap-
parently to be fathomed about this lively girl,
which excited the most intense curiosity among
her companions, but though she was gifted
with an extraordinary degree of apparently
heedless yolubility, which astonished and di-
verted the whole school, talking in a rapid,
irregular manner of all events, past, present,
or to come, with a brilliant confusion of drol-
lery and humour, still she never dropped a
hint which threw the most transient light on
her own situation and affairs. No one knew
whence she came, or who she was, but though

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 163

defying all the powers of all the masters to
render her accomplished, yet Mrs Penfold
evidently treated her with extraordinary con-
sideration; and almost with respect.

Many were the restrictions and directions
given respecting her to the scholars and teach-
ers, which seemed to them most unaccountable,
and several of which were voted by the juve-
nile community to be so peculiarly barbarous
and oppressive, that though the young lady
herself seemed neither surprised nor annoyed
by the rigid watchfulness exercised over all
her motions, it excited among her companions
an indignant pity, and a keen spirit of parti-
zanship. She was!never on any occasion
known to walk with the governesses and the
other girls beyond the narrow limits of the
high garden walls, and on Sundays, instead of
attending the parish church, it was observed

mission to visit with Marion at Sir Arthur
Dunbar’s, but at no other house in the visible
world.

She never spoke of home,—received no
letters, and once only had a visitor, an ob-
ject of keen and eager scrutiny to the little
gossiping community of Dartmore House,
who discovered nothing more, however, than
that Caroline’s aunt, Mrs Smythe, was a gay
fantastic-looking showily-dressed little woman
of no certain age, for whom her niece seemed
to care very little, as the whole flood of her
affections was concentrated on her companions
at school. Money she had in the most lavish
abundance, while she squandered it with a
degree of reckless, and almost contemptuous
profusion, perfectly startling to those who
searcely received as much in a year as she
seemed able to spend in a day on presents for
those she loved, which was the chief use to
which her large funds were devoted.

Marion, the companion and the pet of her
two elder companions, Clara and Caroline,
tried with all her powers to extend her affec-

tion also to Mrs Penfold, but her feelings
found nothing to feed upon in the cold, formal,
rigid manner, and stern upright appearance of
the schoolmistress, who repelled all intercourse
with her pupils, considering them necessary
grievances to be endured in her house, as
a source of existence to herself, but not of
pleasure. Towards these little slaves of edu-
cation, driven from task to task with ceaseless
pertinacity, no confidence was shown, and
between them conversation became systemati-
cally discouraged. A governess was appointed
to sleep in each room to secure silence among
the pupils, few of whom had that glow of heart
and imagination peculiar to Marion, and it
was fortunate, perhaps, that her large stock
of sympathy was not more frequently in re-
quisition, as the most’ astounding confidences
were sometimes imparted to her wondering
ears,

One young lady, in a high fever of ro-
mance, described to Marion at great length,
in the strictest confidence, an elopement which
took place from the school where she had last

been educated, on which occasion the young
narrator had accompanied the bride part of
her way, and returned home without detee-
tion, by climbing in at an open window. An-
other of the pupils asked if she did not think
Monsieur D’Ambereau, the Italian master,
wore singularly handsome mustachios, adding,
that it was a very common custom now for
noblemen to go about in disguise, teaching at
boarding-schools, in order to see the young
ladies; and a third of Marion’s young friends
pointed out to her notice, that many a ringlet
appeared to be more carefully curled than
usual, and many a dress to be put on with
unwonted solicitude, when Monsieur Frescati,
the singing-master, was expected.

Girls in a boarding-school are as unnatu-
rally situated as nuns in a convent, where the
feelings and emotions, being checked in their
spontaneous course, are thrust into channels
for which they never were originally intended.
Marion had a sufficient object in view, every
time she entered a room, from the desire she
felt to please all with whom she associated,

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 167

which gave a vent to the warmth of her af-
fections in secking the reciprocal attachment
of her companions; but many of the other
pupils, shut out from nature with her sun-
shine and flowers, her feelings and emotions,
and wearied by a monotonous, uneventful life
of dictionaries and grammars, snatched. at
every legitimate or illegitimate source of no-
velty or excitement, and their conversation
became as frivolous as a toyshop, while the
hopeless vacaney of, their thoughts obtained
relief if even a blind fiddler or a hand-organ
appeared beneath their windows. It was an
object of romantic interest for the day, to
most of the girls, if an officer in uniform
passed along the high-road, within sight; an
equestrian in plain clothes, if tolerably mount-
ed, furnished them with a subject for exclama-
tions during the following half-hour, and even
the very Doctor, a mere country pill-box,
who, prescribed for Mrs Penfold’s pupils, be-
ing well-dressed, and not much above forty,
would himself have been astonished, could he
possibly have guessed the interest oxcited by

his visits, and the keen discussion which en-
sued after his exit, respecting his slightly
grey hair, and brilliant yellow gloves.

Each young lady at school had a large as-
sortment of romantic stories to relate, in a
confidential under-tone, to her listening com-
panions, of lovers who had committed suicide,
gone mad, or been at the very least rendered
miserable for life in consequence of a disap-
pointed attachment, while the whole party
impatiently anticipated the time, not perhaps
far distant, when their own turn would come
to be idolized, admired, courted, and finally
“perfect love,” with title,
fortune, and establishment all pre-eminently

married to some

superlative. Pure as the swan that passes
through the darkest and most turbid stream
with plumage unsoiled, Marion’s mind in the
mean time remained untainted by the atmos-
phere of evil and frivolity around her. She
caught at all that seemed good, avoided what
was evil, and rejected every thought that
might injure the unsophisticated excellence of
her artless mind. .

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 169

There arose, however, in time, one source
of individual anxiety to Marion, known only
to herself and Mrs Penfold, but it increased
in weight and urgency every year, throwing
oceasionally a shadow of care over that bright
young countenance, in general so beaming
with joy, though with true philosophy Marion
tried often to forget what it had proved im-
possible for her to remedy. Once a-quarter,
or at least during every successive “ half,”
the mortifying fact forced itself upon her ob-
servation, that no bills were so irregularly
paid as her own, for while their amount
rapidly accumulated, Sir’ Patrick’s agent
forwarded annually the very smallest in-
stalments, with a thousand apologies, and
many promises of a final satisfactory settle-
ment at some future period, which period
never seemed any nearer; and Mrs Penfold
often dryly remarked, in the hearing of
Marion, that “short accounts make long
friends.” :

An appeal to Sir Arthur for his inter-
ference, occasionally suggested itself to the

170 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

mind of Marion, but she knew that his in-
fluence was less than nothing, and she greatly
feared lest his vehement partiality to herself
might lead him to overlook the very limited
nature of his own income, and to volunteer
some generous sacrifice, such as she would
rather suffer any privations than occasion.
The pension and half-pay of Sir Arthur very
barely sufficed, she knew, to defray his exten-
sive charities, and to furnish sometimes the
hospitable table, and the bottle of first-rate
claret, round which it was his delight to ga-
ther a frequent circle of old brother admi-
vals; but his purse was little calculated to
stand the shock of such a draft as Sit Patrick
would unhesitatingly have drawn upon it, had
the idea occurred to him that Sir Arthur
might perhaps be induced to take Marion’s
school bills upon himself.

In no instance was it more obvious than in
that of Sir Patrick Dunbar, how precisely in
society men are generally estimated at their
own valuation. He was, like his sisters, pre-
eminently handsome, while the hauteur of his

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 171

demeanour, bordering on a sort of well-bred
contempt for others, rendered his slightest
notice an event of considerable magnitude
even to many whom the world might have
deemed his superiors in-rank, fortune, and
talents. There were a few exclusives, how-
ever, among his own exclusive set, whom he
admitted to the most unbounded familiarity
and good fellowship, inviting them to enter-
tainments, given much more as an ostenta-
tious display of wealth and taste, than from
any feeling that might be dignified with the
name of friendship, and thus by a reckless
and unbounded profusion in dress, equipage,
and hospitality, unchecked by one sentiment
of justice or of prudence, the young Baronet
obtained universal celebrity for his generosity
and good-humour,—anecdotes of which were
circulated with delighted approbation in every
house.

He was known to have tossed a sove-
reign one day to an old woman at a cottage
door, for merely reaching him a glass of
water ; he paid the post-boys double always,

when travelling; he gave ten pounds at a
ladies’ bazaar, for a paper card-case, which he
presented the next moment to Clara Gran-
ville ; and he sent Marion a magnificent rose-
wood box, filled with crystal perfume-bottles,
and gold tops, which cost L.20, when at that
very time she had scarcely a frock to put. on,
and was in agonies of vexation over an un-
paid shoemaker’s bill.

Sir Patrick’s grooms and footmen always
roundly estimated his income at L.20,000 a-
year, and his rent-roll certainly exceeded that
of all the parents united, who paid Mrs Pen-
fold regularly for cramming their children’s
understandings ; but while Sir Patrick made
it a matter of accurate calculation, to train
Marion with skill and sagacity in the way
most likely to take her speedily off his hands,
yet it was no part of his calculation to pay
for any thing in money, if he could do so in
words, and while he rattled off whole estates
in a dice-box, and raced himself into difficul-
ties, entering horses for every cup, and dogs
for every coursing-match, he privately re-

solved that Marion and her embarrassments
should always remain both’ out of sight and
out of mind.

Mrs Penfold’s grave and dry expression of
countenance, became graver and drier every
time she contemplated the rapidly increasing
amount of Marion’s bill, while she urgently
impressed on her pupil’s mind the absolute
necessity of entreating more zealously than
ever for the speedy payment of such very old
scores.

Observing Sir Patrick so exceedingly pro-
fuse in his expenditure, however, Mrs Pen-
fold believed there.could be no cause to ap-
prehend any defalcation at last, being con-
vinced that he might at any time defray her
demands with ease, though the only thing he
never found it convenient to command, was
ready money; and Marion soon discovered
that it made him frantic with ill humour to
be asked for any. Of this peculiarity she
had once an early instance, never afterwards

* to be forgotten. Having received from Sir
Arthur, on her fifteenth birth-day, the first

174 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

five sovereigns which it had ever been her
good fortune to possess, she accidentally
heard Sir Patrick laughingly complain du-
ring her ,midsummer holidays at home, to
Mr De Crespigny, that he had arrived at
the bank that morning, too late to present
a draft for money, and having given his last
shilling to a beggar, he was, according to his
own expression, “ completely cleaned out,”
not having enough even to pay for being ad-
mitted to the exhibition of pictures, and ac-
tually put to some temporary inconvenience
by his penniless condition for that day.

In all the pride of exhaustless wealth,
Marion soon after stole up to her brother's
side, and displayed her glittering treasure ;
but afraid to be suspected of conferring a fa-
vour, with intuitive delicacy she asked Sir
Patrick to take charge of it until the follow-
ing Saturday, that she might consider what
to purchase on that day. Scarcely conscious
of what she said or did, the young baronet
mechanically dropped the sovereigns into his
pocket, where sovercigns in general had a

very short reign, and soon after sauntered
away to the club.

Day after day elapsed, week after week,
and every time Sir Patrick entered the room,
or drew out his pocket handkerchief, Marion
thought she was on the eve of being paid ;
but at length her holidays came to a close,
and still not a syllable transpired respecting
her funds. Rendered desperate at last by
anxiety to re-enter school, laden with pre-
sents to her favourite companions, Marion,
who valued money only as a means of being
kind to others, ventured one day, with glow-
ing cheeks, and faultering voice, to remind
Sir Patrick, for the first time, of their little
pecuniary transaction, which was so very trif-
ling that he had probably forgotten it.

“You tiresome little dear! am I never
to hear the last of those sovereigns!” ex-
claimed he angrily, throwing down his news-
paper. “You deserve not to be paid till
Christmas ! But here they are!
No! I have no change, I see, at present.
Well! I shall remember it some other time !”

 

 

176 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

That “other time” never came, however,
and Marion returned penniless to school, sym-
pathizing more fully than she had ever done
before, in Mrs Penfold’s lamentations respect-
ing Sir Patrick’s carelessness about money,—
a subject which supplied that lady with a
ready-made excuse, whenever she was out of
humour at any rate, for venting it all on her
unoffending pupil, whose sensitive heart be-
came so imbued at last with vexation and
anxiety, that on attaining the age of sixteen,
she ventured to pen an earnest appeal to Sir
Patrick, begging with all the eloquence of
natural feeling, that if the expenses of her
education were inconvenient, she might re-
turn home, where she would willingly shew
all the benefit derived from the advantages
he had already afforded her, by continuing
her studies alone, and by devoting herself
entirely to his comfort, amusement, and hap-
piness.

This letter, which cost Marion agonies of
thought, and a shower of tears, received no
answer whatever ; and with a sigh of unwont-

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 177

ed depression, she dismissed the subject from
her thoughts, and trying to hope the best,
quietly resumed the course of her occupa-
tions, comforted by the consolatory reflection,
that in two years she would have nothing
more to learn—the whole range of human ac-
quirement being supposed to attain its com-
pletion by each of Mrs Penfold’s pupils at the
age of eighteen.

Clara Granville, and Caroline Smythe, hav-
ing attained the highest acme of perfection
under the finishing hand of Mrs Penfold, were
about to be emancipated in a few months from
the thraldom of school, and to astonish so-
ciety by their brilliant acquirements ; respect-
ing the most advantageous mode of displaying
which, great pains had been taken to instruct
them, though the inclination seemed wanting
in both girls, being already surfeited with ad-
miration and panegyric among their masters
and governesses, who vied with each other in
praising their two most advanced pupils, by
whose influence they hoped hereafter to ob-
tain recommendations and employment.

178 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

Marion had strolled one evening with Caro-
line, farther than Miss Smythe had ever been
known to venture before ; and the two- young
friends were seated in an arbour at the ex-
treme verge of the bounds prescribed by Mrs
Penfold, in earnest conversation, while watch-
ing with delight the declining sun, which su-
perbly illuminated a heavy mass of clouds in
the western horizon. Time flew on, and dark-
ness nearly closed around them, while they
diseussed with lively, careless humour, all the
petty annoyances of their daily life, and com-
pared the little hopes and fears they enter-
tained for the future. As the hour became
later, Marion felt that the high exhilarating
key in which Caroline spoke, and her gay, well-
rung-out laugh, made her almost nervous in
the obscure and solitary retreat to which they
had withdrawn ; but ashamed of her own ti-
midity, she determined to conquer or conceal
it.

Marion was flattered when a companion
like Caroline, some years older than herself,
thus treated her with familiarity ; though

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 179

certainly, neither on this occasion, nor on any
other, was it with confidence, as no living be-
ing seemed entirely in the confidence of Miss
Smythe, who, while she appeared gayly and
heedlessly to rattle on in conversation, yet
kept a cautious silence respecting all that
concerned herself.

Many very reserved persons pass for being
perfectly open, by means of a frank, free man-
ner, and by speaking in a confidential tone
concerning the most private affairs of those
with whom they converse ; and this Caroline
did to excess, asking Marion, with every ap-
pearance’ of kindness, a hundred questions,
which in her own case she either could not,
or would not have answered, and testifying
the most cordial, unfeigned interest in all
that related to the prospects or feelings of
her companion, who never attempted to con-
ceal a wish or a thought, and often forgot
that the trust was not mutual.

Caroline was talking eagerly with great
animation, and telling Marion that the only
injury she never would forgive, was, if any of

180 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

those she loved had a sorrow they did not al-
low her to share with them; and especially if
they permitted themselves to suffer from any
pecuniary difficulties which it was within her
power to relieve, when suddenly Marion laid
a hand on her arm, making a hurried signal
for silence, while she whispered in a low under-
tone, ,

“ T have scarcely heard you for the last five
minutes. Did you observe that strange-look-
ing man, very much muffled up, who scrambled
several minutes ago to the top of the garden-
wall? He was staring wildly about him for
some time, then glided noiselessly down, and
has suddenly disappeared?”

“Where? where?” whispered Caroline,
grasping Marion’s hand with a look of wild
alarm, and speaking in a low hoarse tone of
extreme terror. “ For your life, Marion, do
not stir! Tell me which way he went? He
must not see us. O how on earth has he
traced me out !”

“ Who? asked Marion, bewildered and
terrified, when she beheld a degree of frantic

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 181

alarm depicted on the countenance of her com-
panion, which seemed almost unaccountable.
“ Dear Caroline ! whom do you fear ?”

“ A madman!” replied Miss Smythe, in
accents of mingled anger and disgust. “ He
has haunted me for years! He threatens
either to murder or to marry me; and you
may guess which I think the worst! He has
even adopted my name! Did you never hear,
Marion, that he actually put his marriage to
me last year in the newspapers! He besets
my footsteps—besieges my dwelling-place,
persecutes me with letters, sends me his pic-
ture, follows me to church, throws stones at
my windows in the night, and frightens my
very life out, yet the law leaves me unprotect-
ed, because he commits no actual breach of
the peace. It was to avoid him that I beg-
ged my aunt to let me live here ! How did he
discover my retreat !” ‘

Caroline seemed to have lost all command
of herself in the agony of her fear, and pour-
ed out a flood of words in the rapid and sub-
dued accents of extreme terror, while she re-

182 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

treated into the darkest corner of the arbour
to sereen herself from observation, hastily
dragging Marion along with her, and whisper-
ing an eager request, if they were discovered,
that she would endeavour herself to get off,
and fly towards the house for assistance.
“ Meantime I shall engage his attention; but
if he once sees me, ail hope of escape on my
part would be vain, while the very endeavour
might irritate him! Every thing depends on
you, Marion! be resolute, and lose not a mo-
ment, or you may be too late.”

In agonized suspense and apprehension the
two friends remained during several minutes,
cowering behind the overhanging branches,
and searcely venturing to breathe, while Caro-
line bent her head eagerly forward to catch
the slightest sound, and grasped Marion’s
arm almost convulsively, as if to secure her
being perfectly immoveable; at length, after
sometime, she heaved a deep sigh expressive
of relief, and looked up, saying,

“‘ He is surely gone! he must be gone! I
never eluded his eye before !—his sight is

almost supernatural, but he must be gone at
last! let us hurry home !”

“ Stop!” whispered Marion in an under
tone, “I heard a rustling close behind us
among the leaves and branches. Some one
certainly approaches

“ Fly then, Marion! all is over, and I must,
face the danger!” said Caroline with sudden

energy, while rising and drawing herself up to
her full height, with a resolute countenance,
though her limbs evidently trembled beneath
her, she walked towards the door, saying, in
a loud commanding accent, to a tall man
much muffled up in a loose great-coat, who
had now appeared at the door, “ Who goes
there? Ernest !!” added she, in tones of
angry remonstrance. “ How dare you enter
my presence again! How dare you intrude
here !”

“ Be true to yourself and me !” replied the
stranger, in a voico which sounded harsh and
excited, while the deep full tones appeared to
Marion as if she had heard them before, but
the darkness prevented her from seeing him

184 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

distinctly, even if his dress had not been suffi-
cient to disguise him from the most penetrating
eye. “ Say what you will, I know you are glad
to meet me,” added he, in accents of inereas-
ing wildness. “ All that you do is dictated
by others; but Caroline, in her secret heart,
loves me! I know that! By your looks, by
your voice, by your manner it was revealed to
me years ago! Yes, you love me, and cannot
deny it! Speak but the word, and we may
both be happy,—happier than the wildest
dreams of fancy. No impediment can prevent
it. Let your aunt conceal you where she will,
she cannot hide you from me,—in the farthest
corner of the earth,—in the deepest dungeon
that ever was dug, I shall find you out, and
still free you from persecution. She may do
her worst, but love laughs at locksmiths, and
I can still enable you to elude her vigilance.
I come now prepared, if you will but consent
to fly with me !—now,—this moment.—If not,

The madman’s voice, which had been loud
and vehement, here dropped into a low, stern,

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 185

inaudible murmur, and his hand plunged into
the breast of his coat, seemed as if it grasped
some weapon there, while Marion, taking ad-
vantage of his pre-oecupied attention, darted
off with the speed of thought, and almost as
noiselessly fled towards the house. A loud
angry ery to stop her, mingled with curses
and imprecations, from the madman, while he
waved his singularly long arms menacingly
above his head, only accelerated her pace,
while he followed some steps in pursuit; but
terror gave wings to her feet, and rushing
into the entrance-hall, she instantly rang
the large dinner bell, and raised an alarm,
which assembled the whole household, all
of whom gazed with looks of panic-struck
astonishment at Marion’s pale and ghastly
countenance.

Not a moment required to be lost in expla-
nation, for Mrs Penfold seemed at once to
guess the whole nature and extent of Caro-
line’s danger, the instant her name was men-
tioned ; therefore Marion had but to point out
the direction in which she might be found,

186 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

when Mrs Penfold hastened forward, preceded
by several of the more active servants.

When Marion had rapidly executed some
orders committed to her, she quickly returned
towards the arbour, but not a trace remained
there of any one. The little table had been
upset, several branches torn down that sur-
rounded the entrance, and the grass beneath
was much trampled and disfigured; but all was.
silent and deserted. After one hurried glance
of alarm and perplexity, Marion hastened for-
ward to the garden gate, which she found had
been violently burst open, and on emerging
into the high road beyond, she there found
Mrs Penfold and her servants all crowding
round Caroline, who remained in a dead faint
on the ground for nearly half an hour.

A carriage was rapidly disappearing at full
speed in the distance, but already almost too far
off to be distinguished; and Marion perceived
the figure of a man lurking behind the hedge
close beside her; but when she made it evident
that he was observed, he rushed up close to
her side, saying, in a threatening tone, between

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 187

his clenched teeth, “ You have provoked a
madman !”

Scarcely had Marion time to utter an ex-
clamation of sudden affright, before he sprung
over the hedge, and was seen running across
the neighbouring fields, until his figure min-
gled with the surrounding gloom, and vanish-
ed out of sight.

Mrs Penfold’s chief care, after Caroline's
recovery from her alarming swoon, was ear-
nestly to enjoin that the circumstances of this
adventure should never be mentioned, or so
much as remembered by those who had wit-
nessed them; a story so extraordinary and
alarming, being likely to injure her establish-
ment, besides causing much unnecessary gos-
sip among the younger pupils; but had Marion
even been disposed to consign, as desired, the
whole adventure to oblivion, she could not but
be continually reminded of it for several
weeks afterwards, by the startled and agitated
manner of Caroline, whose frolicsome spirits
had entirely deserted her, while she seemed
for some time to be in imminent danger of

188 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

anervous fever. If any one appeared suddenly
in the room, she almost screamed with the
start it occasioned her; she could not bear
for a moment to remain alone, and seemed as
if continually listening, even when safe in the
house, for the sound of steps in pursuit of
her. Gradually, however, her mind became
more composed, and she ventured one day to
take a stroll with Marion in some of the
nearer parts of the garden, though even there
she scarcely spoke above her breath, and
turned hastily round several times, as if ap-
prehensive that some one approached.

Had the far-famed Upas tree grown over
the arbour, Caroline could scarcely have
shunned more fearfully the slightest approach
in that direction, and with equal care did she
avoid any allusion to what had occurred
there, not a hint of which ever transpired in
her most confidential moments. The very
sound of her own feet on the gravel seemed
to startle her, and as she walked beneath the
shade of some tall forest trees which over-
hung the garden-wall, Marion observed that

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 189

Caroline trod more cautiously; and though
she dropped not a word respecting her feel-
ings or fears, it was evident that her nerves
were strung to an agony of sensitiveness, for
the fluttering of a bird in a hedge, or the fall
of a leaf, made her start, and she seemed
about at last to give up the point in despair,
and hurry homewards, when suddenly a loud
shrill whistle arose amidst the branches of an
ash-tree, almost directly over their heads, and
before Marion had time to look round, a
small packet had dropped at the feet of
Caroline.

With a half-suppressed cry of alarm, the
terrified girl fled, while Marion, scarcely less
frightened, instinctively picked up the parcel,
and followed, while again she was pursued by
a volley of oaths and imprecations, which
ended in a Jaugh so wild, so maniacal, and so
fearful, that for months afterwards it rung in
her ears, causing her a shudder of horror and
alarm.

When Mrs Penfold tore open an innumer-
able multitude of seals which closed the

190 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

packet addressed to Caroline, she discovered
within only a long incoherent letter of several
sheets, filled with the most extravagant pro-
fessions of ardent love, and the most vehe-
ment declarations, that nothing on earth
could impede or discourage him in his resolu-
tion to carry her off, which he seemed still
persuaded, with the self-delusion peculiar to
madness, must be a welcome assurance to
Caroline, whose words and actions he perse-
veringly attributed to the arbitrary influence
of others. Accompanying this farrago of
most intolerable nonsense, was a black shade
in a wooden frame, representing the profile
of a young man, certainly handsome, and
which seemed to Marion like features she
had known elsewhere, but being frequently
addicted to observing resemblances, she felt
at once persuaded that this must be some
such vague and unaccountable likeness as she
had frequently found or fancied before.

Time wore on, and still Caroline lingered
at school, unwilling apparently to forsake
the comparative quietness of Mrs Penfold’s,

a

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 191

where, though her age exceeded by some
years that of the other pupils, and though
her cotemporary Clara had been already in-
troduced into society, she still seemed anxious
to forget herself and her affairs in the multi-
tude of her masters and studies, so complete-
ly was she engrossed by which, that she evi-
dently grudged every moment and every
thought which interrupted her progress. At
length, on the evening previous to that fixed
on for her final departure from school, when
Mrs Smythe was expected to convey her
home, Mrs Penfold was bestowing on Caro-
line some of her last advice, on the most ap-
proved modes of “ getting on” in society, and
especially on the manners and conversation
most attractive to gentlemen, when a note
was brought into the room, which had ar-
rived by express, bringing the melancholy in-
telligenco that Mrs Smythe’s carriage had
been upset a few miles off, causing so severe a
blow on the head, that a concussion of the
brain had taken place, and she continued in-
sensible, at a village some miles off, where

192 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

little hope remained of her recovery. * The
Doctor who wrote these hurried particulars
had obligingly sent his own carriage and ser-
yant to convey Miss Smythe to the spot, that
she might take a last leave of her dying rela-
tive, and he recommended that she should
not lose an instant, or it might be too late to
find the sufferer in life.

Struck with grief and consternation by this
most unexpected and calamitous intelligence,
Caroline, though she had never before seemed
much to love her aunt, yet now became over-
whelmed with the shock, and lost not an in-
stant in hastily preparing to obey the melan-
choly summons, by throwing on her cloak and
bonnet, while she rushed into the arms of
Marion, and burst into an agony of tears in
bidding her farewell.

The French governess who had been sum-
moned to escort Caroline in the carriage, was
one of those nervous persons, who became
perfectly frantic when hurried, and she flew
about the room, uttering a volley of inco-
herent exclamations, expressive of her wonder

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 193

and perplexity at so sudden a call on her ac-
tivity, while her preparations seemed to make
no visible progress. There is a secret, mys-
terious pleasure in being waited for, which
every living mortal seems to enjoy when they
have the opportunity ; and without a thought
of Caroline’s impatience, her anxiety, and her
sorrow, Madame D’Aubert expressed the
most eager and vehement solicitude about her
own dress, and a resolution not to stir till
equipped to her entire satisfaction, for so
rare and almost unprecedented an event, as
leaving the boundaries of Dartmore House.

Every thing that has a limit, however,
must come to an end, and Madame D’Au-
bert’s toilette being at last completed, she
leisurely advanced, talking to herself and to
everybody else, arranging her shawl, and
giving a last finish to the contour of her bon-
net, before she threw herself with dignified
deliberation into the ehariot.

Marion had affectionately insisted on con-
veying her weeping friend to the carriage,
while, with all the little arts of affection, she

194 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

tried to console and encourage her, till at
length they exchanged a final embrace, and
parted. Scarcely, however, had Miss Smythe
placed her foot upon the steps, while the
man-servant who accompanied the carriage
carefully assisted her in, before Marion sud-
denly sprung forward with an exclamation of
terror, seized hold of Caroline’s dress, and be-
fore she could speak, dragged her forcibly
into the house, exclaiming in accents almost
inarticulate from alarm,

“ Come back, Caroline! come back! This
is some mistake ! some dreadful trick !_ Caro-
line! dear Caroline! come back! That ser-
vant wears the very dress of the person who
attacked you in the garden! I cannot see
his face, but I am certain it is he

Before Marion could finish her sentence,
the supposed servant had violently seized
Miss Smythe by the arms, and was about
forcibly to drag her towards the carriage,
when the loud cries of Marion brought as-
sistanec. The almost fainting girl was res-
cued, and the post-chaise secured; but not

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 195

a trace could be seen of the madman, who
instantly vanished ; and the post-boy could
give no intelligence respecting him, except
that he had been ordered out at an inn close
by, in urgent haste, that evening, with a
promise of double payment if he implicitly
obeyed the gentleman, who seemed highly
irritable, and swore at him in a most fearful
manner, if he made the slightest delay, or so
much as asked a direction which way to turn.

The most diligent search was made, but
made in vain, by the officers of police, to find
out the lunatic’s retreat, which eluded their
utmost research; and as Caroline Smythe
was privately removed soon afterwards from
school, where the subject was forbidden ever
to be mentioned, the whole story seemed al-
most buried in oblivion, and Marion herself
felt at last as if the entire adventure had
been an agitating dream, remembered by no
one but herself.

CHAPTER VII.

“ Hear! hear! and a laugh !
Parviamentary Departs.

Manton’s sister, Agnes, five years older than
herself, after being distinguished as the best
musician, best sketcher, best linguist, best
everything, at Mrs Penfold’s, had left school
with no real knowledge, except of the most
frivolous kind, accidentally gathered in con-
versation, and repeated again in society like
a parrot. Formed to excite the most rap-
turous admiration, by the gorgeous magnifi-
cence of her almost regal beauty, art had act-
ed the part of the Fairy Bountiful in form-
ing Agnes, while nature had showered her
choicest gifts on Marion.

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 197

Agnes was brilliant without being interest-
ing, and dazzling without being attractive, for
her mind seemed irremediably and incorrigi-
bly vulgar, selfish, and vain. A good actress,
an inimitable mimic, and incomparable in a
tableau, she assumed generally a queen-like
dignity of manner, “stalking through life,”
as Sir Arthur said, “with an assured and
stately step, as if practising for her appear-
ance as a Duchess at the next coronation.”

Admiration seemed to Agnes the only plea-
sure of life, and amusement its only business ;
while, if ever she had possessed any sensibi-
lity, it was frittered away on the fictitious
sorrows of the Adelines and Julias in the
volumes which she read with surpassing dili-
gence from a circulating library ; though in
all -other respects, Agnes wasted her time
amidst such listless idleness, that she might
have let her nails grow, like those of a Chi-
nese mandarin, to testify how literally she
did nothing.

No one, certainly, could excel Agnes in
turning up her hands and eyes at the faults

198 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

of others; but those who trace nothing ex-
cept evil in their companions, have seldom
much good in themselves. Marion found it
one of the most important and pleasing stu-
dies in the world, to comprehend the charac-
ter and temper of her friends and connexions,
besides her own, with a wish to render her-
self suitable to them, as her mind, pliable
without weakness, was bent on constantly
yielding her own wishes to those she loved ;
but this unobtrusive generosity was only a
subject of satirical remark to her sister, who
could neither understand nor believe in Ma-
rion’s utter singleness of heart, and disinter-
estedness ; her own sole aim being selfish in-
dulgence, and her sole rule to obtain it in the
easiest possible way.

Self-love was the ruling passion of Agnes ;
love of others the quickening principle, or
rather impulse with Marion, who would have
zealously planted flowers for even strangers
to enjoy ; but Agnes would have plucked all
those of her friends, and scarcely taken the
trouble to rear any even for her own use.

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 199

Agnes, cold, vain, heartless, and self-suffici-
ent, thought she was made only for this
world, and this world for her, and for such
as herself, young, gay, rich, and lovely, while
all others were mere intruders on the crea-
tion. But Marion, on the contrary, followed
the dictates of her own heart, in wishing to
do good of every kind to every person, while
still she had learned to aim above nature, to
that high standard of Christian perfection, so
exalted, that those who have gained the most
elevated human attainment in virtue and ex-
cellence, must still consider the structure of
their minds, however beautifully decorated
with generous sympathies and kind emotions,
as being only begun, while they perseveringly
aspire upwards, even to the measurement of
that Divine Being who left us an example
that we should follow his steps.

Agnes had now been, for three seasons, the
reigning beauty of Edinburgh! There it is
the privilege of every tolerable-looking girl to
be considered in her own set pre-eminent,
during the first winter after she is intro-

200 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

duced; but though the public eye usually
grows weary of the same features, however
perfect, during a second campaign, Agnes had
apparently taken out a diploma of beauty,
the reputation for which seemed confirmed to
others by her own thorough conviction of be-
ing completely unrivalled, and by the exult-
ing consciousness she displayed of her own
supreme loveliness. Three seasons of tumul-
tuous joy, triumph, and conquest, had already
sueceeded each other, during which Agnes
was, to use her own expression, “ fiercely
gay,” yet still no younger rival had appeared
to eclipse the dazzling array of her charms;
and not a whisper was heard that the fresh-
ness of her Raphael-like beauty was at all im-
paired; nor were any ladies ever heard to
“wonder” what gentlemen could possibly see
to admire in Agnes Dunbar, as not a dissent-
ing voice had yet ventured to make itself au-
dible on that subject.

Agnes began life with that perfect confi-
dence in her own knowledge of the world,
universally felt by young ladies under twenty,

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 201

especially when they have seen very little of
it, and with a thousand schemes and projects
of perfect happiness. Though one after an-
other her castles of cards fell to the ground,
still, in the exercise of persevering energy,
she rebuilt the edifice again with new mate-
rials, and on what she imagined a better con-
struction, but still in every instance, to her
own unutterable astonishment, she found that
most unaccountably, “hope told a flattering
tale!”

Considering every officer she danced with
as a hero, and every gentleman who paid her
a compliment as a lover, Agnes wasted her
first season, as most young ladies do, in flirt-
ing with scarlet uniforms, the inhabitants of
which were generally so much alike in ideas
and conversation, that if blindfolded, she
might have found it difficult or impossible to
distinguish which of her countless red and
gold admirers happened at the moment to be
“doing the agreeable.”

All her military victims were dying to know
what Agnes thought of their brother officers ;

202 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

whether she intended to adorn the next ball
by her presence, or the next concert; how
she liked their military band ; if she proposed
patronising their night at the theatre ; whe-
ther she preferred a galope fast or slow; how
she thought the colonel’s daughter looked on
horseback ; whether she did not think it bar-
barously tyrannical of the commander-in-chief
to insist on their all wearing uniforms; how
she liked the new regulation jacket ; and
above all, whether she thought the order
for their wearing mustachios an improvement
or not!

To all these subjects, and many more of
similar import, Agnes lent her very profound
attention, not only during the discussion, but
in many a solitary hour, while her whole
head, heart, and understanding were crowded
with the recollection of epaulettes, musta-
chios, spurs, and gold lace, and she privately
believed that the supreme felicity of earth,—
all the most refined sensibilities of life, and
all its brightest joys, were to be found at
Piershill Barracks.

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 208

Sir Patrick laughingly alleged that Agnes
had rehearsed a set of prepared conversations
suited to every different occasion,—a musical
conversation for amateurs, full of crotchets
and quavers,—a hunting conversation about
foxes, dogs, and steeple-chases,—a Court of
Session conversation for the lawyers,—and a
dragoon conversation, diseussing at great
length whether officers should dance with
spurs or without them, and in which she had
been known to enumerate correctly, the fac-
ings of every regiment in Her Majesfy’s ser-
vice.

Her brother often and loudly declared that
nothing is more perfectly hopeless, than for
any young lady to expect a serious attach-
ment from an officer actually quartered with
his regiment, as it was against all rule, and
contrary to all nature or custom, for Cupid to
attack the army. The mess-table, he assured
her, invariably sets its face against matri-
mony, and the mess-table conversation was an
ordeal, through which he protested that few
young ladies could wish their names to pass;

204 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

but nevertheless, Agnes, full of groundless ex-
pectations and lively vanity, continued to en-
dure a succession of heart-rending and unac-
countable disappointments, from very promis-
ing military admirers, who had stolen her
bouquets, listened to her music, and drunk Sir
Patrick’s claret month after month; but no
sooner did marching orders come for Dublin,
Leeds, or Canada, than these interesting
affairs came to an untimely end with a P.P.C.
card, or a sort of never-expect-to-meet-again
bow, and Agnes was left with the army list
in her hand, wondering what regiment would
come next, and whether there were many un-
married officers in it.

“How amusing it is,” said Agnes, in a
confidential mood, one day to Clara and Caro-
line, “ when I walk about with Captain De
Crespigny at the promenades or balls, and see
all the other beaux looking angry or disap-
pointed !”

“ Nothing on earth is so charming, I sup-
pose, as to be a beauty !” exclaimed Caroline,
with a good-humoured sigh, and a look of

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 205

comic humility, “ I would sacrifice ten years
of my life to be admired for one! To hear
people saying, ‘ Have you seen the lovely
Miss Smythe? Is Miss Smythe to show her-
self at Lady Towercliffe’s party? and then,
like you, Agnes, to have all the beaux dying
for me !”

“TI would rather be married for any at-
traction in the world, than mere beauty,”
said Clara, earnestly ; “‘ even money is a more
tolerable motive. How insufferable it would
be, to live with a person whose affection de-
pended on whether your hair were well dress-
ed, or your shoes well made !”

“That is the very thing I should like !”
exclaimed Agnes, “ to see it considered of the
greatest consequence whether I wore pink or
blue, and whether it were one of my well-
looking days or not !”

“ But then, Agnes, your well-looking days
would occur seldomer and seldomer, while,
during the very periods of illness and depres-
sion, when attention and kindness are most
needed, a fastidious husband would feel in-

206 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

jured if your complexion were not at its
best,” replied Clara, laughing. “No! no!
give me the happiness that will, as my milliner
says, ‘wash and wear well !’—good fire-side
domestic comfort.”

“ Comfort! I hate comfort !” said Agnes
indignantly, “a stupid, detestable word, as
opposite to real happiness as night is to day !
T shall be satisfied with nothing short of feli-
city.”

“ But felicity can last only a day, while
peace and comfort may be enjoyed for life,”
replied Clara. “ In talking of marriage, you
seem to think of nothing beyond the honey-
moon, and to forget the hours, days, and
years of actual life that must follow!”

“ Tt is absolute nonsense looking so far out:
to sea, as you do, Clara,” said Agnes, impa-
tiently. ‘‘ How I shall enjoy, next winter,
perhaps, chaperoning you both to parties if I
can find any fascinating victim, tall, thin, and
handsome enough to please me.”

“ But surely you would not, for any consi-
deration, marry yet!” exclaimed Caroline.

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 207

“ Lady Towercliffe says, that the holiday of a

girl’s life is from the time she leaves school

till the day she marries, and you should enjoy

ten years at least, Agnes, before you are
, tempted to begin the cares of life.”

“ Cares!” exclaimed Agnes, with a con-
temptuous laugh, “I do not mean ever to
take any cares upon myself! but, as Captain
De Crespigny very sensibly observed yester-
day, the husband worthy of me should be made
on purpose. In the first place, he must be
rich, for I have a scruple of conscience in
even witnessing a poor marriage, where, after
the wedding-cake has been eaten, there is no-
thing else left. In every thing,—even the
mere choice of a ribbon,—I am fastidious, and
would rather not have a thing at all, than
dispense with getting precisely what I like.
My intended, then, must have been educated
at Eton, for I do think the ugliest bit of hu-
man nature on earth is a Scotch school-boy of
about fourteen. He must have such a foot!
so small! oh! fo foot at all, He must em-

Paris, and never wear the same gloves twice.
He must of

“ My dear Agnes! this should be all put

 

into the contract !” said Clara, laughing. “ It
perfectly ruins me to hear you talk so extra-
vagantly; and, besides, pray be warned in time
of your own probable fate, that the beauty of
a family, or the beauty of a winter, is said
always to make a poor marriage. I never
could understand the reason of that; but
Lady Towereliffe says, men are perverse be-
ings, who like to criticise and undervalue a
professed beauty, while, in the mean time, they
are taken by surprise, and fall in love unex-
pectedly with some obscure girl, whose charms
they discover, or fancy for themselves, and
whom, probably, not another man living ever
thought tolerable.”

“ For my part,” said Caroline, “I shall
wait till a person can be found as handsome
as Sir Patrick, as agrecable as you tell me
Captain De Crespigny is, as clever as Mr
Granville, as merry as young De Lancey

 

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 209

“And as rich as Lord Doncaster !” inter-
rupted Agnes.
“No! no!
plied Caroline, colouring, speaking in a singu-
lar tone of asperity, “I hate and abhor
money as a consideration in marrying! I

 

, a hundred times no!” re-

wish money had never been invented! Tt
becomes a misery for those who have too
much, as well as for those who have too
little.”

“ Well! give me money,” said Agnes,
laughing. “And let me tell you, Caroline,
that even if you have eight or ten thousand
pounds, which is probably the utmost, you
will find it no great inconvenience during
the long run of life. Money has its merits,
and I should be afraid to marry any man,
even the most romantic of my lovers, if it in-
volved the necessity for his sacrificing one of
his usual comforts;—if it obliged him to drink
his bottle of sherry instead of claret every
day, I am not quite sure that he would never
begin to grumble! They tell me it should
be considered a happy marriage where a man

210 MODERN FLIRTATIONS,

does not wish himself twiee every day un-
married again. No, no, money is no bad
thing, and if you have any to spare, pray let
me have the surplus.”

“ Who, and what are Mrs and Miss
Smythe?” was a frequent question of Agnes
to herself, never apparently to obtain a satis-
factory answer. On Caroline leaving school,
her aunt had taken a villa at Portobello,
where the two English strangers excited ex-
treme attention, more from their evident de-
sire to avoid it, than from any thing very
remarkable in their appearance or manner,
though Mrs Smythe was certainly of that
genus old maid so common in England, with a
handsome independence, a suite of servants, a
pony-carriage, most splendid dress, and some
pretensions still to youth and beauty, as any
fragment of good looks that yet remained she
most liberally displayed ; while her manner
had a flirting tone of coquetry most unsuit-
able to her apparent age, forming a singular
contrast to the quaker-like simplicity of Ca-
roline’s dress.

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 211

There was a singular contrast between the
gravity of costume affected by Miss Smythe,
and the keen festivity of spirit with which she
entered into every scheme of amusement, or
even, it might be said, of mischief. Her viva-
city was occasionally almost overpowering,
her fancy lively beyond example, while with
her brilliant, yet interesting animation, there
was mingled a rare acuteness of mind, a swift
comprehension, and an innate passion for all
that was amiable or beautiful, which gave live-
liness and vigour to what she said, though the
rapidity of her mind sometimes led Caroline to
a false estimate of persons and circumstances,
as she always judged or acted from instantane-
ous impulse; yet there was a generous frank-
ness in her disposition, which captivated those
who knew her, and a graceful simplicity in all
she did, which gave it interest; for, without
intention, there was something in all her
thoughts or actions, striking and peculiar.

Her features, though irregular, attracted
and enchained the eye, from the magical
variety of their expression, and though an

212 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

amateur of mere beauty might have been sur-
prised and perplexed to divine why her light
grey eyes, pale cheeks, and chesnut hair
could beguile his attention away from the
more perfect contour of others, the amateur
of physiognomy was delighted to find there
an eyer-varying source of interest in watch-
ing the bright emanations of thought, feel-
ing, and vivacity, which glittered or spark-
led in her eye, or played about her mouth,
When Mrs Smythe first settled at Porto-
bello, scarcely a week of gossiping, wonder,
and conjecture had elapsed, in the little
community around, when she requested to
have an interview with Sir Arthur alone,
which took place immediately, and must have
excited much interest in his mind, as the
Admiral remained silent and abstracted dur-
ing the whole subsequent evening, while he
strolled slowly up and down the drawing-
room, “pacing the quarter-deck,” as he called
it, for a length of time; and, after being
closeted some hours the following day with
Mrs Smythe and his confidential agent, they

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 213

proceeded to a magistrate’s house together,
with whom they requested a private confer-
ence, the purport of which did not transpire.

From that day, an intimacy, amounting
to friendship, was established between Sir
Arthur and the two ladies, who seemed on all
occasions to look to him for advice and pro-
tection, and in whose house they spent a part
of every day, to the unspeakable delight of
Henry De Lancey, who was charmed, on his
return from college, to find so agreeable an
addition: to the small circle at Seabeach
cottage.

“ Years rush by us like the wind ;” and
how rapid seems the transition from boyhood
to mature years! Henry had early attained
an extraordinary development of mind and
appearanee, a strength of intellect and a deci-
sion of purpose which seemed to Sir Arthur
almost precocious, while every day discovered
some new talent, or enlarged those he already
possessed, for his mind seemed ever on the
wing and full of energy. “‘ Either he is nobly
born, or nature has a nobility of her own,”

214 MODERN FLIRTATIONS,

thought the Admiral, when viewing the char-
acter of his young protégé, as it gradually
arose to personal and intellectual supremacy.
His mind was ardent, courageous, and deeply
contemplative, full of generous impulses, but
apt to view all that happened to himself
through an exaggerated medium. His mys-
terious history, and the fascination of his
manner and appearance cast a spell over the
interest and affections of all who beheld his
countenance, or heard the sound of his har-
monious voice. With a strikingly handsome
person, he had already acquired a decided air
of fashion and refinement, while a bright vein
of almost chivalrous romance which enlivened
his mind, was subdued by a poetical tempera-
ment, inclining him to dwell much on melan-
choly musings, relating to the strange cireum-
stances of his own early history. Keenly sen-
sitive to kindness or neglect, his love and gra-
titude to Sir Arthur were without bounds,
and his brotherly affection for Marion was
tinged with the natural enthusiasm of his dis-
position, but before long the warmest and

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 215

deepest feelings of his nature were secretly
concentrated on the gay, giddy, and fascinat-
ing Caroline Smythe. Every scrap of paper
that came in his way became covered with
sketches of her buoyant figure and graceful
profile, in a variety of animated attitudes ; or,
on other occasions, verses in Latin or English,
little better certainly than the nonsense verses
at school, immortalised her charms.

Young as he was, however, Henry’s spirit
recoiled already from the danger of loving too
well, or being beloved by any, when he was
taught, in hours of solitary reflection, to re-
member that principle and honour must for-
bid him to seek a mutual attachment, while
his name and station remained unknown, and,
perhaps, disgraceful. There was a bewilder-
ing power in Caroline’s society, which chained
him to her side wherever they met, while, con-
trary to his resolutions and wishes, his every
look, smile, word, and action became steeped
in love. Often and severely did he upbraid
himself for this vain and dangerous indul-
gence, but he seemed spell-bound and unable

216 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

to remember, in her presence, any thing but
the delight of listening to her gay sallies and
her delicious laugh; though the mirth of her
young eyes beeame veiled often by a look of
care as sudden, as it was to him unaccount-
able, being so foreign to the sparkling, almost
mischievous gayety of her nature.

Henry's devoted, and nearly boyish attach-
ment, raised in his heart many a high aspira-
tion after future distinction, many a bright
hope of honour, promotion, and usefulness.
The model for his imitation in every thing
noble and distinguished was Sir Arthur, and
he resolved to sacrifice love itself, till he had
attained, like him, a name and a station for
himself. ‘The very sound of Sir Arthur’s step,
the very tones of his voice, were dear to him ;
and, casting aside every softer emotion con-
nected with his romantic reveries respecting
Caroline, he became impatient to face the
bitter blasts of the world’s trials, taking his
beloved benefactor for his example, and the
Holy Scriptures as his guide.

“ Perhaps,” thought he, allowing his young

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 217

mind to wander away from the dull inexorable
realities of life, while a rapturous smile of an-
ticipated joy lighted up his countenance.
“ Perhaps, when honour and distinction have
at last crowned my efforts, I may yet be ac-
knowledged in the face of the world, by those
connexions who have now so mysteriously
cast me off. Perhaps Caroline herself may at
last be proud to return that fervent attach-
ment, of which she has not yet even a suspi-
cion! The old proverb says, ‘all men know
what they are, but none know what they shall
be!’ I know neither the one nor the other;
but I must not be satisfied with vaguely co-
veting learning, honour, or usefulness hereaf-
ter, contemplating like a mere child the end
without the way, but seek them energetically.
Nothing is impossible to those who persevere !
This may and must be a rough world of diffi-
culty to me, but amidst a thousand buffetings
and humiliations to come, I feel an undying
hope of success, while even in this scene of
hard and trying discipline, my best comfort
and encouragement shall ever be drawn from
VoL. I. K

218 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

the august truths of religion, in all their
awfulness and solemn obligations.”
Knowledge is power, and knowledge of
character is the greatest power of all, but
Henry, in general very penetrating, was per-
plexed by the flirting, light-headed manner of
Mrs Smythe, whenever she was in the society
of gentlemen her own contemporaries in age,
and the grave deferential manner she adopted
towards her young companion, whom she
seemed to treat almost inadvertently as her
superior, though the slightest indication of her
doing so usually brought the ready colour of
Caroline in vivid flashes to her cheek, and
caused an appearance of mutual embarrass-
ment between the aunt and niece, which sur-
prised and puzzled him. Their extraordinary
munificence to the poor and public charities
also astonished him, as that appeared so
widely disproportioned to their visible means
and usual expenditure, though it seemed only
to please without surprising Sir Arthur, who
was accustomed to give so liberally himself,
that Henry sometimes feared he encouraged

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 219

his newly-found friends in a degree of lavish
extravagance, inconsistent with the ordinary
means of single ladies; yet all was given with
a graceful negligent indifference to the vulgar
subject of pounds, shillings, and pence, quite
unprecedented. Subscriptions to church ex-
tension, missionaries, schools, Bibles, blankets,
food, clothing, coals, money, and medicine,
were scattered around them with unsparing
profusion, though it appeared to Henry, that,
in the case of Mrs Smythe herself, whose
name always appeared ostensibly on the list
as the larger contributor, there was less ala-
erity in giving, than in Caroline who seemed
to be purse-bearer for both, and always de-
frayed the whole amount.

Among the many things which surprised
Henry in Mrs-and Miss Smythe, nothing had
that effect more than the keen, intense, and
rather satirical interest with which both ladies
gathered up every particular relating to the
manners, flirtations, and adventures of Cap-
tain De Crespigny, though it was evident,
that while both ladies could relate every par-

220 MODERN FLIRTATIONS,

ticular of his former history and character,
neither knew him by sight. Mrs Smythe
mentioned rather contemptuously some vague
recollections of him formerly as a pert, awk-
ward school-boy, while, to Henry’s inereasing
perplexity, the young lady’s colour visibly
rose to carnation whenever he was unexpect-
edly named, and her eyes usually glittered
with a suppressed smile, if any anecdote or
description in Sir Arthur’s conversation re-
Jated to him, till at length the curiosity which
had so long been evidently fermenting in the
minds of Mrs and Miss Smythe, exploded one
day in the form of an eager request, that Sir
Arthur would invite Captain De Crespigny to
meet them at dinner.

Marion and Henry were amused at the
laughing alacrity with which Sir Arthur at
once consented, and they observed, after the
note was despatched, that many a whispered
consultation took place, and many a merry
jest passed among the lively trio, to which
they were not made a party, while the two
ladies appeared evidently in extacies of amuse-

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 221

ment at their anticipated introduction. Ma-
rion would have given worlds to witness the
scene, but her furlugh from Mrs Penfold’s
had expired on the very day of Sir Arthur’s
party, and she was most unwillingly deposited
in a carriage with her baggage, at the mo-
ment when Captain De Crespigny alighted in
full huzzar uniform, out of the minibus which
had conveyed him from Piershill.

The Admiral’s party was exceedingly small
and select, but the guests appeared all in gay
buoyant spirits, while Captain De Crespigny,
seeing but one young lady in the room, looked
upon himself as her natural property, and
handed her to dinner, though no formal pre-
sentation had taken place. ;

With Caroline he was, before long, flirting
to the top of his bent, while she assumed a
charming look of consciousness when he ad-
dressed her, reeeiving the whole artillery of
his small talk and civilities with a most inter-
esting expression of naivété, though once
Henry observed in her smile so odd a mixture

a look of covert humour lurked in her eye,
and quivered on her lip, that he could not
but wonder at the grave demure look which
she affected.

Nothing was ever more enchanting to Cap-
tain De Crespigny than the blushing averted
looks with which Caroline listened to all his
insinuated admiration, while now and then
she nodded and smiled with the prettiest air
of incredulity imaginable, if he professed it
more openly. Occasionally, however, Captain
De Crespigny was almost put out of counte-
nance by her very unexpected replies, or very
mal-apropos questions, Which gradually led
him on, he seareely knew how, into flirting
perfectly @ [outrance,: while opportunities
seemed purposely afforded him with a degree
of tact perfectly incredible in one so young,
and apparently unsophisticated, to say even
more than he had ever said before. With a
gay, laughing animation, almost amounting to
silliness, the young lady archly doubted his
sincerity, admired his wit, and slyly misunder-
stood all his compliments, till he was obliged

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 223

to repeat his meaning, and explain his insinu-
ations, making his professions and speeches
all so exceedingly plain and undisguised, that,
to his own astonishment, he found himself
positively making love, on a very few hours’
acquaintance, with a degree of explicitness
which had never occurred to him in the whole
course of his practice before.

In the evening Caroline was, after many en-
treaties, prevailed on to favour Captain De
Crespigny with a song, and never had he been
so completely perplexed, as by those with
which the young lady, preserving a look of
most imperturbable gravity, proceeded to fa-
your him. She seemed to have a dozen differ-
ent voices, and half-a-dozen different styles of
performance, but had evidently been well
taught, and displayed occasionally some beau-
tiful notes. At first her tones were clear and
sharp, accompanied by the strangest flourishes
and cadences that Captain De Crespigny had
ever heard or imagined. In the next song,
her voice was low and husky, while her eyes
were most sentimentally elevated to the ceil-

ing, with a sort of St Cecilia expression, rather
partaking, however, of the ludicrous, and in
her voice another like a mouse in a cupboard.
At one time her tone reminded him of a well-
known singer at Vauxhall; at another he felt
persuaded she was taking off Clara Novello ;
occasionally there was so considerable a tinge
of the brogue, that he became convinced she
must be Irish, and she ended by singing,
“The Dog's Meat Man,” in a tone out-
screaming a peacock, but adopting the air
and attitude of a Catalani, and concluded with
looking exultingly round in expectation of rap-
turous applause, which Sir Arthur bestowed
in abundance, and Captain De Crespigny in
comparative moderation, being for the first
time in his life at a loss to know whether he
were treated on this occasion in jest or in
earnest.

Repeated subsequent meetings at Seabeach
Cottage continued the intimacy which Cap-
tain De Crespigny had so oddly begun, and
his curiosity became more and more piqued,
by the singularity of Miss Smythe’s manner

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 225

and conversation. She displayed, along with
a most extravagant love of amusement, a ge-
nius for satire and mimicry quite unprece-
dented, and in which she most freely in-
dulged. Many a scene was acted over by
her, and supported by Henry with astonish-
ing talent and vivacity, for both seemed to
have a similar propensity, being able, after an
hour’s intercourse with any individual, to imi-
tate his whole peculiarities with almost magi-
cal precision,—to follow in an imaginary con-
yersation the very train of his ideas, and to
represent every little trick or habitual expres-
sion, every turn of the head, and every tone
of the voice, with a gay look of mockery
which would have made their fortunes on the
stage.

One evening, Sir Arthur having delivered
up to his young friends the key of an old
chest, filled with velvet coats and brocaded
silk dresses, formerly worn by his bye-gone
ancestors, Caroline, Henry, and Captain De
Crespigny amused themselves by grouping
some beautiful tableaux, and by acting cha-

226 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

rades. At one time, both the gentlemen ap-
peared in similar costumes, as Shakespeare’s
two Dromios in the Comedy of Errors, when
Sir Arthur suddenly exclaimed, as if he had
made some great discovery, “ How very
strange that I never before observed the like-
ness between you two good-looking young fel-
lows! I declare it is quite remarkable! If
you were brothers in reality as well as in pre-
tence, it could scarcely be more striking!
Do pray Captain De Crespigny, turn your
profile more towards Mrs Smythe, that she
may see what I mean !”

Henry laughingly received these remarks
as an undoubted compliment, and bowed with
good-humoured grace to Sir Arthur, who ob-
served with astonishment that Captain De
Crespigny’s colour rushed to his very temples,
and receded again, leaving his countenance
pale and almost ghastly, while he suddenly
broke off the entertainment, and strode up to
the fire-place, where for some minutes he
stood, with his back to the company, in evi-
dent agitation, while a dead silence ensued.

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 227

“ Well!” whispered Sir Arthur to Caro-
line, “ I have often been told that people are
never pleased with a likeness, but certainly
Louis De Crespigny is the most conceited of
men, to feel so intolerably angry at being
compared to my young friend here. There
are certainly worse-looking people in the
world than Henry!” added the Admiral,
with a look of partial affection. “ And it
was no such insult as De Crespigny seems
to think, when I paid him the compliment,
to say that he resembled my boy, who
is in every respect the very pride of my
heart.”

“I wish the Captain may never meet with
a greater mortification,” replied Caroline,
laughing; “ and I am sure he would be much
the better of a few pretty severe ones to
keep him in his senses !”

Henry meantime had observed with good-
humoured surprise, and no small degree of
perplexity, the excitement, so disproportioned
to the occasion, into which Captain De Cres-
pigny had been thrown by Sir Arthur's: re-

228 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

mark, but with boyish frankness he instantly
went up to him, saying, in a lively and rally-
ing tone,

“ Tam sure Sir Arthur did not mean any-
thing personal, Captain De Crespigny ; but
his remark only proves my uncommon skill in
assuming a likeness to any one I please. My
success in disguising myself at college, was
often beyond my intentions or utmost hopes.
‘You would not know me yourself, if I repre-
sented an old man, or a French hair-dresser,
as I have sometimes done !”

“ Indecd !” replied Captain De Crespigny,
trying to recover himself, “TI should think
there was not the dress upon earth in which
I would not know you again !”

“ Well! some day perhaps, as a beggar, 1
may, with your leave, beguile you of half-
a-crown.”

“Tt would be a clever beggar who sue-
ceeded in that! but I defy you there. Half-
a-erown! why! I have only as much as that
to keep me till midsummer! You have my
free leave to try me at any time, or in any

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 229

way you please, and my pardon for all your
success !”

“T'can only say,” interposed Sir Arthur,
“ that the impudent rascal brought real tears
into my eyes, not long ago, by a story he
trumped up at my door, which would have
deceived the whole Mendicity Society. He
can make himself appear as old as myself,—
and I declare one day he looked not very
unlike your uncle, Lord Doncaster !”

A vivid flush passed over the whole fore-
head and features of Captain De Crespigny
at these words ; but assuming a sudden tone
of liveliness and vivacity, he summoned Henry
to continue their entertainments for the even-
ing, which were to be concluded by acting a
proverb, of which Sir Arthur and his guests
were to discover the design. Miss Smythe,
dressed in cottage costume, -seated herself
pensively on a stool, after which Captain De
Crespigny, equipped with a bow in his hand,
and carrying on his back a quiver filled with
all the old pens in the house to represent ar-
rows, entered in the character of Love, and

230 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

was about to aim his darts at the peasant
girl, when Henry, disguised in a tattered old
cloak, to personate poverty, limped slowly
into the room. On secing this beggarly ap-
parition, Cupid, pushing his hair up till it
stood on end, assumed an expression of comic
horror, and with a shriek of dismay, rushed
to the window, as if about to jump out.

The whole party laughed heartily, and de-
clared that the denouement of this piece con-
tained a most salutary lesson against a mere
love-match ; and Sir Arthur said, for his own
part he would attend to the warning,—that
all portionless young ladies might consider
the case hopeless with him, and he trusted
every one present intended to be equally pru-
dent !

“Yes! most assuredly
tain De Crespigny. “I am almost tempted
now to take my uncle’s advice, and propose to

my cousin, Miss Howard the heiress, though
love flies out of the window whenever I think
of her. She was a little pert, red-fingered,

memory of that girl often haunts me like a
night-mare since, for my poor mother on her
death-bed, got a promise made about our be-
ing married, or something of that kind. I
never heard the particulars, but I believe we
were to be made acquainted, and refuse one
another, before either of us could accept any
one else, but I should think there could be
little chance of anything that depended on
my being refused !”

Captain De Crespigny was bowing himself
off late in the evening, and taking a very par-
ticular leave of Miss Smythe, having called
up all his most fascinating graces for the oc-
casion, while he felt inwardly gratified by the
pleasing conviction that another had been
added to the list of young ladies whom he
had made miserable for life, when he was
surprised to observe her mouth perfectly qui-
vering with suppressed laughter, and an arch
satirical gleam in her eye, for which he could
not account, though it made him feel some-
what uncomfortable and dissatisfied. If it
were possible that any one could be laughing

232 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

at him, she certainly was! A world of most
intolerable ridicule appeared in her expres-
sion,—an air almost of contempt! and he
turned to leave the room with a feeling of
mortification and anger which he was ashamed
to allow even to himself.

When Captain De Crespigny hurriedly
opened the drawing-room door, near which
he and Caroline had been standing, he was
surprised to see a person lurking close behind
it, who darted instantly away and disappeared;
but before the intruder was out of sight, an
exclamation of terror and dismay escaped
from the lips of Caroline, who rushed towards

» Sir Arthur, exclaiming in accents of almost
frantic alarm, “ He is there! he is there!
oh! save me, Sir Arthur! he is there! That
horrid, dreadful man! he is there! stop him!
stop him !”

Captain De Crespigny instinctively ran in
pursuit of the retreating figure, and eagerly
attempted to seize him, but the fugitive in-
stantaneously opened the house door, and
escaped in the darkness, while, apparently to

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 233

intimidate his pursuer, he fired a pistol in the
air, and waved another above his head with
frantic gestures of rage and violence.

“Jt is beyond all measure extraordinary
how he got into the house !” exclaimed Sir
Arthur, in discussing the event with an aspect
of grave perplexity. ‘“ My doors are most
systematically locked after dusk, and not a
window is unbarred, yet the locks are unbrok-
en, and the bars untouched !”

“ There is something next to supernatural
in the way he invariably finds us out, and gets
access everywhere,” said Mrs Smythe, in al-
most breathless agitation. ‘‘ One would ima-
gine he had gome unearthly accomplice to dis-
cover where we are concealed, and to assist
him in escaping the vigilance of the police.
Night and day we have been liable to his in-
eursions. In town or country—in the draw-
ing-room or beside our carriage—in church, or
going to a party—there he is, lurking secret-
ly near us, or terrifying Caroline by his sud-
den appearance, and gliding away like a sha-
dow. He baffles every attempt to overtake

234 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

or arrest him, but seems for ever on the
watch ! Sometimes he used to make his pre-
sence known by throwing a stone at our win-
dows; often at midnight, by singing hoarsely
beneath them, and even occasionally by firing
a pistol in the air; but I did hope in this re-
mote corner we might have enjoyed peace and
safety. How are we ever to venture home.”

“T shall escort you with the whole party in
close phalanx,” replied Sir Arthur, trying to
assume a rallying tone. “ Old Martin and
myself are quite invulnerable, and I only wish
my secretary were also here, as he would be a
host in himself; but he is absent on a month's
leave, and for the first time in my life I miss
him !”

The night being impenetrably dark, and
not a sound to be heard but the echo of their
footsteps on the gravel, when Mrs Smythe
alighted from her carriage to walk across the
garden leading towards her house, Sir Arthur
immediately desired the servants to bring out
lights, when one of the candles having flared
up suddenly near Caroline, she thought she

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 235

perceived the madman close beside her, lurk-
ing behind the stem of a large tree. The
dark shadows concealed all but his face,
in which there gleamed a look of maniacal
triumph and malignity, while rushing close up
to Captain De Oréspigny, he said in a threat-
ening tone, low and distinct, “ He who crosses
my path shall die!” and instantly disappeared
through the hedge. When Miss Smythe, on
hearing his voice, with a stifled scream of ter-
ror fled into the house, again that loud and
fiendish laugh, which she had already heard
onee, arose behind her, and rung through the
night air in tones of high delirium, causing a
cold shudder to thrill through the hearts of
even the boldest among her companions, while
they hastily followed her, and having placed
the trembling girl in apparent safety, soon
after took leave, charging the servants to
chain and double-lock the door.

It was some hours before Caroline could
sufficiently compose her mind to retire; but af-
ter the house was perfectly quiet, and the ser-
yants in bed, she sat up reading with the hope

236 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

that her nerves might become less painfully
agitated. The slightest noise caused her heart
to beat almost audibly, and she was conscious
that a mouse rattling in the wainscot would
have caused her to faint. Mrs Smythe could
searcely be prevailed upon to leave her alone,
but as they both slept on the drawing-room
floor, only divided by a thin partition, Caro-
line induced her at a late hour to withdraw,
while not a sound now disturbed the deep re-
pose of nature, but “ the wailing sorrows of
some midnight bird.”

The moon had arisen, shining with softened
radiance into her apartment, when Miss
Smythe arose from her devotions, and she
could not but think at the moment what a
bright emblem of her divine Saviour that glo-
rious luminary presented to the mind, not
glowing like the sun with a radiance which no
human eye can gaze upon, but reflecting upon
the darkened earth a mild subdued refulgence,
perfectly suited for the steady contemplation
of those whom it had arisen to benefit and
cheer.

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 237

Nature was hush’d, as if her works ador’d
‘The night-felt presence of ereation’s Lord |

Pleased with such thoughts, a gradual com-
posure stole over her senses, and Caroline at
length, seeing her candle nearly burned out,
consequently determined to retire for the
night. Not a sound was to be heard in the
house, but her own light ‘step, as she’ mov-
ed about the room,—the very opening of a
drawer, or the shutting of her book, sounded
unnaturally loud, jarring upon her nerves with
a startling effect,—the shadows in the more
distant part of the room looked darker than
usual, and the least moan’ of the wind in-
creased the painful tension of her nerves to
agony. Scarcely had she begun to undress,
when a sudden noise not far off caused her to
start with convulsive terror, her heart became
chilled with apprehension, the’ candlestick
which she carried in her hand ‘fell to the
ground, the light was extinguished, and she
stood trembling and alone in total impenetra-
ble darkness.

238 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

Caroline tried to persuade herself that the
sound must have been produced by her own
excited fancy,—she looked around and all was
quiet,—she listened and all was perfectly still,
—she reasoned with herself, and became re-
solute to try whether sleep might not plunge
her into forgetfulness and peace, when her
attention was accidentally attracted towards
one of the windows, where the bright moon-
beams rested on an object which seemed to
blast her eyes with horror, and paralyzed her
at once in a speechless agony of fear. The
top of a ladder rested on the window-sill,
upon the summit of which stood the dark
figure of a man, his face plastered so close
upon the glass, that his nose was perfectly
flattened against it, and his hands raised in a
menacing attitude towards her. The instant
he saw, by Caroline's look of frantic alarm,
that she had seen him, he dashed in the win-
dow-frame by a single stroke of his powerful
arm, and seemed about to make a forcible en-
trance, when Miss Smythe, with the energy of

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 239

despair, threw open the door and fied, calling
aloud in the sharp shrill accents of despera-
tion for help.

The servants were speedily assembled around
her, and the instant she felt herself in compa-
rative safety, nature could sustain no more,
but, convulsed in every nerve, and throwing
herself into the arms of Mrs Smythe, with
a ery of thankfulness and agitation, she
fainted. Y

An instant. alarm was given in the neigh-
bourhood,—a diligent search was made,—and
the police for several days exerted their ut-
most activity to detect the miscreant, but in
vain. Not a trace remained to convince Caro-
line that the whole had not been a hideous
dream, except that the ladder had been left
standing at her window, and turned out to
have been stolen from a neighbouring garden,
—the window-frame exhibited a frightful pie-
ture of devastation, being literally broken to
fragments,—and at some distance in the gar-
den, a loaded pistol was discovered, perfectly

and purchaser, seeing that it had been so re-

Smythe, he felt some solicitude respecting her
safety, while he expressed ten times more than
he felt, and observed, in his usual off-hand style,
that this was not the only man whose head she
would probably turn, but in his own case,
though she had almost put him out of his
senses already, yet he would rather make an
end of himself than of her.

Caroline dryly thanked him for his obliging
intentions on her behalf, and after a lively
dialogue, in which the gay huzzar actually ex-
celled himself, in his fervent expressions of ad-
miration and regard, he took leave, rather
wondering to think how he had been led on in
professing so much, and giving himself a lec-
ture as he rode home, on the propriety of be-
ginning to “back out,” seeing that he was
getting rather beyond his depth. Still there
were several of the reasons for meeting next
day, usual with those who have a natural
desire to improve an agreeable intimacy,—a
song to be praetised,—a drawing to be admir-
ed,—and Miss Smythe having made a sort of
promise to let Captain De Crespigny sit to

her for his picture in the character of Dromio,
as she was an admirable artist, the offer be-
came irresistible. He had never yet entered
their own house, as meetings were always
hitherto arranged at Sir Arthur's, and a
slight feeling of curiosity likewise helped him
to the agreeable conclusion, that he must for
once, and only once, call on “the Smythes,”
were it only to ascertain what sort of esta-
blishment they had.

Punctual to the appointed hour, Captain
De Crospigny’s groom rung a consequential
peal for his master at the gate of Rosemount
Villa, such as kad not been heard there since
bells were inveated, and after a considerable
delay, the door was opened by a shabby awk-
ward-looking Irish girl, speaking with a pow-
erful brogue, who courtesyed with an appear-
ance of most preposterous respect to Captain
De Crespigny as he alighted, and pointed up
stairs, begging him to walk in, but without
having an idea apparently, that she ought her-
self to usher him into the drawing-room.

Being alyays pretty confident of making

himself weleome, Captain De Crespigny ad-
vanced, and in his usual gay humorous tone,
announced his own name at the drawing-room
door, while he threw it open and entered. To
his surprise he now found himself in a small,
not very splendidly furnished apartment,
stretched on the only sofa belonging to which,
there lounged in solitary indolence, with a
quite-at-home-look, a young man whom he
had never seen before. His aspect and dress
were equally singular, presenting that happy
mixture of the ruffian and the gentleman, not
very uncommon in Ireland. Attired in a mili-
tary great-coat, he wore a most preposter-
ous pair of whiskers and mustachios, long,
coarse, and dirty, which looked as if they had
been curled over knitting wires. Taking the
last remnant of a cigar out of his mouth when
the visitor entered, and showing not the small-
est surprise, with a smile which betrayed a set
of dingy decayed teeth, and a very disfiguring
squint, he watched the approaching step of
Captain De Crespigny with a degagé look of
indifference, saying in a tone of easy familiarity.

the door, “Is n't it relations we shall be

‘Relations ! what do you mean, Sy! Here

easy good humour. “ My aunt, Mrs Smythe,
dropped me a lire, to say I would be wanted
about the settlenent, though for the matter of
that, there is net much, I fancy, on either of
your parts to settle. More gold on the out-
side of the pocket, than the inside, Captain!
Hey! excuse me! but as my aunt says, in

“ You mutt be slightly deranged, sir,” in-
terrupted Ceptain De Crespigny, in a tone of
angry perpleity; “I have heard that a mad-
man is loos: about this neighbourhood, and I
need not g¢ far, I see, to find him !”

“What! Hey! Sure you're not going to

line, ani nothing left but to fix the day, I
laughed beady to kill myself, and says I, ‘ you

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 247

“No more of this folly, Sir!” exclaimed
Captain De Crespigny, with rising irritation,
and in his most peremptory tone. “ Detain
me here one moment longer, and I shall send
you a shorter way down stairs than you ever
tried before !”

“ Och, murder! you'll excuse me, Sir, but
T’'ve not been dipped in the Shannon for no-
thing! This must all be settled as gintlemen
usually settle these affairs in our counthry !
Sure you met my cousin at Sir Arthur’s many
a time, and you'll not be afther denying that
she convarsed with you every day for a
matther of four hours !”

“ Perhaps she had that honour, but what
then?”

“ Why thin, Sir! such things as you said,
from such a gintleman, are not easily to be
forgotten !”

“ You are pleased to be complimentary !”
replied Captain De Crespigny, turning round
his magnificent head with an air of bitter
contempt ; “ but what of that ?”

“T heartily wish,” continued the Irishman,

248 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

with a still stronger brogue than before,
“that every young lady who meets with a
gintleman such as you, had a cousin like
Paddy Smythe to take up her cause, and I
am as little to be thrifled with as any man in
Ireland! The tongue that deceives me or mine
shall never spake again. I have exchanged
shots before now on a slighter occasion !”

A momentary pause ensued, during which
Captain De Crespigny frowned and bit his
lip, in angry embarrassment, while, with a
look of unutterable contempt and disgust, he
eyed his companion, who thrust his hands into
his ample pockets, and paced up and down
the room with rapid strides and determined
emphasis. At length, stopping opposite to
his irritated companion, he eyed him for some
moments, with a look of stern reproach, say-
ing, in a stronger Irish brogue than ever, and
with a torrent of indignation, which gave al-
most the dignity of eloquence to what he ut-
tered,

“You think there are no feelings in the
world to be consulted but your own! perhaps

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 249

we may prove this a slight mistake! I have
married seven of my cousins already to officers
quarthered in our neighbourhood at Lime-
rick, and Caroline is the last! Captain Mor-
timer was introduced to Mary at the top of a
country dance, and engaged her for life be-
fore he reached the bottom. Lieutenant
Murray gave his arm to Bessy for the first
time going down to dinner at Mrs Fitz-
Patrick’s, and offered her his hand before the
fish was off the table! We understand these
things very soon in Ireland! and I would
shed every drop of my blood before Caroline
shall be disappointed !”

Captain De Crespigny began now to feel
seriously annoyed at his own position! Not
having lately been quartered in Ireland, he
had forgotten how such affairs are managed
there, but at this moment a thousand recol-
lections crowded upon him, of warnings he
had received from his brother officers respect-
ing the prudence and circumspection to: be
exercised beside the Shannon, though most of
what they said, had been listened to with the

250 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

same incredulous attention usually bestowed
upon stories of ghosts and witeheraft. Here
he was, however, snared like a fly in a spider's
web, though without a single doubt of his
own powers to eseape, and with no stronger
objection to call out this insolent ruffian be-
side him, than the publicity and ridicule
which he must inevitably incur, if involved in
a vulgar every-day duel with a hot-headed
Irishman.

Seeing that the affair was likely to take a
graver turn than he had imagined, Captain
De Crespigny now slowly and_ resolutely:
strode towards the hearth-rug, and turning
his back to the fire, in that attitude peculiar
to Englishmen, calmly and sternly looked in
the face of his insolent companion, whose lip
became compressed with an air of fierce de-
termination, while his dark eye glittered with
a triumphant smile, and in an attitude of per-
feet nonchalance, he returned Captain De
Crespigny gaze for gaze, while leisurely re-
suming his lounging attitude on the sofa.
Neither gentleman seemed at all inclined to

recommence the discussion immediately, and
both looked equally angry, till the Irishman
at length opened a pocket-book, to which he
frequently afterwards referred, with a busi-
ness-like air, and in a tone of conscious
triumph, saying,

“ Will you be afther denying all you said
to my cousin only last night ”

“T deny nothing, Sir, except the right
you, or any human being can have, with what
I choose to say, five minutes after it has been
uttered!” replied Captain De Crespigny, al-
most delirious with rage, and drawing in his
breath between his clenched teeth, while the
Trishman eyed him with provoking coolness,
and merely muttered in reply, while still re-
ferring to the pocket-book,

“That is not our way in Limerick!
Scareely one of my cousins had a case like
this! Breach of promise! Sure it would
fetch a verdict to-morrow; but the short-
est way is the best! Why, Sir! you
told my cousin, poor girl! that you wish-
ed there were not another man on the

252 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

earth, in case she might prefer him to
you !”

“ But luckily there are many, or she would
have little chance of a husband!” replied
Captain De Crespigny, almost beside himself
with rage. “I have said the same thing a
thousand times, to a thousand different young
ladies, without expecting them ever to think
of it more !”

The Irishman looked away for a moment,
as if some irresistible fecling had come over
him, which he could scarcely suppress, and
with a slight quiver in his voice, as if on the
yery eve of laughter, though Captain De
Crespigny was too angry to notice it, he sang,
while looking out of the window, these words,
with very marked emphasis,—

“ Erin, oh | Erin’s the land of delight,
Where the women all love, and the men they all fight.”

At length, Captain De Crespigny, losing all
patience, followed his antagonist to the win-
dow, and said, in a tone of angry command,

“Let there be a truce to this most con-

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 253,

temptible farce! If you are a gentleman,
which I very much doubt, send any respect-
able friend—a man of honour, if you happen
by chance to know such a person—to my bar-
racks, and before to-morrow I shall find, if
possible, some blundering Irishman who can
understand you, to settle this absurd affair.”

“That may soon be dene,” replied Mr
Smythe, “if I am not satisfied with your in-
tentions.”

“ Intentions !” re-echoed Captain De Cres-
pigny, in a frenzy of contempt. ‘“ My in-
tentions were merely to amuse myself for an
hour or two with a rather pleasing young
lady, and ——.”

“ Rather pleasing! ! you may be proud of
your gallanthry !” replied the Irishman, with
more real indignation in his voice, than it had
yet exhibited. “Perhaps, Sir, being the lady's

cousin Aa

 

“Tt is no matter who you are! Iam not
here to be questioned like a member before
his constituents. I did not know the young
lady had a relation on earth.”

254 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

“The more shame to you, Sir, for meaning
to deceive her!” replied the Irishman in a
tone of stern reproach. “If I were to get
all Ireland for holding my tongue, you should
hear the truth. But maybe you would be
afther giving me satisfaction in another way.
I'm not such a wild beast as to thirst for
blood, if it can be done with pen and ink !”

Captain De Crespigny fixed his eyes with
stern contempt upon his free and easy com-
panion, who passed his fingers through his
long bushy wig, stretched his leg upon the
sofa, and spoke with a yawning voico, while
he added in a careless off-hand way, “If my
cousin could only be persuaded you meant
nothing from first to last, there’s an ensign
in the 42d, with very good prospects, she
might have for the asking! Here is a paper.
I prepared it in case you might object to the
match; and if you'll only sign this assurance
that you meant nothing, for the lady’s own
satisfaction, you are a free man. It will save
us both a deal of bother and fighting, A
man who has fought a dozen times like me,

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 255

may go out once too often; and my pistols
are all at Dublin !”

Captain De Crespigny paused a moment,
irresolute what to do. It was a condescen-
sion quite intolerable, to have another mo-
ment’s intercourse with such a man; and to
sign any paper at his request, seemed almost
a degradation ; but. then he ‘saw before him
a long vista of vulgar annoyances from this
forward Irishman. He was aware that hun-
dreds of gentlemen would laugh, if the story
got any publicity, and that dozens of young
ladies would feel themselves aggrieved, if it
became circulated that his attentions had
been so very marked to an obscure Miss
Smythe.

The tea-tables, the newspapers, the club,
and the mess, were all to be dreaded; and
seeing that the Irishman had, with an air of
perfect nonchalance, buried himself behind a
double number of the “ Times,” which he
seemed to be attentively reading, Captain De
Crespigny glanced his eye over the paper,
and finding that it contained only a short and

256 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

simple declaration that he never had intend-
ed to marry the young lady introduced to him
by Sir Arthur Dunbar, he hastily signed his
name, tossed the paper contemptuously across
the table, and, with infinite dignity, strode
out of the house.

Great was his surprise when descending
the staircase, to hear in the room he had so
recently left, a simultaneous burst of smother-
ed laughter from several persons. He could
not be mistaken! It seemed even as if there
were female voices in the number; but al-
most bewildered with anger, and happy also
to escape, he hastened onwards, threw him-
self on horseback, and galloped for three
hours before he had regained any portion of
his usual equanimity.

Had Captain De Crespigny followed his first
impulse, on hearing the laughter behind him,
it would have been to retrace his steps, and
re-enter the drawing-room of Mrs Smythe,
when his astonishment would certainly not
have been small, to see Henry De Lancey
laughingly disencumbering himself of his

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 257

whiskers, wig, and mustachios, while Mrs
Smythe exclaimed, in accents of almost con-
valsive risibility,

“Well done, my adopted nephew! You
deserve to be my heir! I have often heard
that my old aversion Louis de’ Crespigny’s
exploits were inimitable in his line, but we
needed such a specimen as this. I bestow
the fright upon him, with all the pleasure in
life !”

“T only hope, if we ever in the course of
years meet again, that my cousin will not
recognise me!” added Caroline, smiling. “ It
was not particularly flattering to see Louis
in so much alarm! Yesterday, however,
when he saw me last, I was certainly looking
my very worst !”

“Your worst is better than the best of
anybody else!” exclaimed Henry, in a tone
so exactly resembling that of Captain De
Crespigny, that Mrs Smythe started, and
looked round with alarm; while Caroline,
and young De Lancey burst into a simul-
taneous laugh of frolicesome glee, and con-

258 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

tinued the dialogue during several minutes,
with great spirit and vivacity, till Henry sud-
denly became conscious, that in imagining the
words of another, he was gradually betrayed
into expressing his own real feelings, and that
too, with a depth and fervour which sincerity
alone could have dictated.

Checking himself in a moment, while the
colour rushed to his face, dyeing it red to the
very roots of his hair, and instantly receded
again, he took a hurried leave of Mrs Smythe,
and turning to Caroline with a quivering lip,
he said, in a voice which none but herself
could hear, “I must not say in jest what I
feel in earnest! Farewell! There are wishes
known only to my own heart, and never to be
realised, which I must try to forget. You go
to-morrow, and we shall probably meet no
more! Forgive me, then, if I say, that so
long as I live, you shall be first in my most
respectful and devoted affections; and death
only can ever make me forget you.”

Before Henry left the ante-room, being in
search of his hat, he found it laid beside an

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 259

open portfolio on the table, which, having in
his haste accidentally thrown down, he began
hastily collecting its contents, when his sur-
prise was great, on turning up one sheet of
the drawing paper, to find there a finely-exe-
cuted sketch, done with all the skill and spirit
of an accomplished artist, representing the
venerable head of Sir Arthur; and on the
same paper—could it be possible !—an al-
most living representation of himself. The
likeness very much flattered, he thought—
exceedingly flattered ; but still it could be no
other ; and the picture dropped from his
hand in the transport of his delight.

Henry again returned to the portfolio, hur-
riedly turning the leaves over ; and amidst a
variety of superbly-finished miniatures, he
found his own countenance over and over
again grouped in animated contrast with that
of Sir Arthur. His heart throbbed with joy,
when, after hastily turning to the title-page,
he discovered, according to his hopes and
wishes, the name of Caroline Smythe ; and
he leaned his head on his hand, contemplat-

260 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

ing that name in silent extacy, while indulg-
ing for one moment, the pleasing, but per-
haps presumptuous hope, that he had been
remembered with unacknowledged partiality,
and that the secret of Caroline’s heart was
here portrayed with her own pencil.

He was about then to withdraw, when sud-
denly the raised and irritated tones of Mrs
Smythe became unavoidably audible to him,
from the room‘he had so recently left, saying,
in accents of angry remonstrance,

“That look of girlish joy when he comes,
and the sadness of your eye when he departs,
might betray it to any one less interested than
myself; but he has met few ladies hitherto,
and on his part it is a mere boyish fancy,
which, if properly discouraged, will of itself
wear out.”

Henry had fled to avoid hearing what was
not intended for him, before Caroline replied,
in a low, agitated voice,

“T think and hope you are mistaken ; but
his constancy and disinterestedness shall be
tried and proved. I would rather any man

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 261

should cut my throat for money, than marry
me for it. A girl of fortune, like Midas, turns
all who look on her to gold; and Iam not a
gem to attract many lovers, without a very
brilliant setting. I have a romantic desire
to be chosen for myself alone—a vain dream
perhaps never to be realized, unless young
De Lancey prove constant. If not, I mean
to declare war upon all mankind,—to be a
perfect Captain De Crespigny for flirtations !
to talk to gentlemen, ridicule, mortify, and
humble them !—to do every thing in short,
but love or marry any one of them !”

Though Caroline spoke these words in a
tone of lively badinage, there was a tremulous
bitterness in her manner, as she turned away,
and contemptuously threw upon the table a
massive gold chain which she usually wore,
saying, “ Lovers! I'll get fifty, and break the
heart of every one of them !”

When Captain De Crespigny next visited
Portobello, during a review of his regiment,
he was surprised to see the well-remembered
windows of Rosemount Villa closed, and a

ticket suspended over the door, intimating
that it was “to be sold or let, furnished or
unfurnished ; entrance immediately ; rent mo-
derate !” and with a feeling of relief he dis-
missed the whole affair from his thoughts,
and the whole family of Smythes from his
memory for ever, while humming one of his
favourite airs,

“It is good to be merry and wise,
It is good to be honest and true ;
It is good to be off with the old love,
Before you be on with the new.”

CHAPTER IX.

Has sorrow thy young days shaded,
‘As clouds o’er the morning fleet ¢
‘Too fast have those young days faded,
That, even in sorrow, were sweet.

Amone the companions of Agnes and Marion
Dunbar, none was more calculated to excite a
feeling of enthusiastic tenderness and regard
than Clara Granville, whom all approached
with a feeling of nearly romantic interest, oc-
casioned by the etherealized delicacy of her
lovely countenance and fragile form. Sir
Patrick, from her earliest childhood, had
always mentioned Clara in terms of such ex-
aggerated enthusiasm, that Agnes, imagining
his taste to be very different, believed him to

264 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

be more than half in jest, though his language
and manner seemed daily to become more in
earnest, while in terms of rapture he admired
her eloquent and intelligent conversation, so
different from the flippant nonsense of most
girls, and the light gracefulness of her step,
saying she looked like some beautiful appari-
tion, less encumbered with body, and more en-
dowed with spirit, than any one who ever be-
fore stepped upon the earth. Her pale golden
hair, falling like a halo round her fair bright
countenance, and the rare beauty of her large
downeast eyes, which were generally veiled
with a look of deep thought and sensibility,
gave a charm so peculiar to her aspect, that
the eye loved to dwell upon it as upon some
lovely twilight scene, over which the light of
heaven was casting its pure and peaceful,
yet fading refulgence. None looked at Clara
without fearing that she could not be long in-
tended for this world, as the fervour of her
mind and feelings appeared so little in propor-
tion to the extreme delicacy of her com-
plexion, which was tinted like a rose-leaf on

MODERN FLIRTATIONS, 265

her transparent cheek, the colour flitting with
every passing emotion. It did indeed seem
as if the sword within must quickly wear out
the scabbard; yet Olara enjoyed society be-
yond measure, and mingled in it with a zest
which caused Sir Patrick often to say she
must be stronger certainly than she looked,
and that there was nothing, he thought, more
odious ina woman than rude health—a sort
of rudeness never certainly attributable to
Miss Granville.

Agnes’s favourite aversion had always been
Clara, formerly her cotemporary and rival at
school, though the rivalship was only felt on
one side, as Miss Granville would have re-
mained unconscious of its very existence, but
for the bitter taunts occasionally levelled at
her, and the tone of evident irritability in
which Agnes took it always for granted that
the jealousy was mutual, attributing thoughts
and motives perpetually to her gentle com-
panion, of which so amiable and well-regulated
a, disposition was incapable. It may generally

be observed, that many more quarrels arise
‘VOL. I. M

266 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

from people wilfully taking offence, than from.
people wilfully giving it; and there is quite as
much ill-temper in the one case as in the other.
Clara had suffered much on account of her
every inadvertent word or action being pur-
posely misconstrued ; but she very properly
viewed the annoyance as a salutary lesson in
cireumspection, before entering the great arena
of society, and mildly-avoided all collision of
interests or opinions with Agnes, though her
whole powers of conciliation were worse than
useless, if any attentions on the part of Sir
Patrick gave his sister reason to apprehend
that his affections might by possibility be en-
gaged to her. Nothing could be more painfully
irritating than the tone of contempt with
which Agnes “ spoke at” Clara respecting the
art and cunning with which some manceuvring
misses endeavoured to push their fortune in
the matrimonial world, by making advances
to gentlemen, which she would despise herself
for condescending to, and that lookers on see
more of the game than is intended. All this
was said in such an accidental tone, and in

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 267

such general terms, that no decided notice
could be taken of it by Clara, who neverthe-
less felt so painful a consciousness of what
was meant and insinuated, that she ceased
almost entirely to visit Agnes, or to associate
with her.

About the time when Mrs Smythe left Por-
tobello, Sir Patrick returned from spending a
month at Lady Towercliffe’s in Fife, evidently
labouring under a depression of spirits very
unusual with him; and when Agnes, perplex-
ed by observing that he did not attempt to
throw off the cloud of melancholy, tinged very
strongly with ill-humour, which had so sud-
denly come over him, tried to guess or dis-
cover the cause, she found it for some time
impossible to gain a glimpse of the truth,
though she asked as many questions as
might have filled a volume of Pinnock’s Cate-
chisms.

At length, after some miscellaneous conver-
sation one day, Agnes inquired for the twen-
tieth time whether the party in Fife had been

268 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

agreeable, when Sir Patrick shortly and drily
replied,

“ Clara Granville was there !”

“ But had you any new beauties ?”

“ Clara Granville !”

“Pshaw! Well, then! were there any
agreeable people %”

“ Clara Granville !”

“You are beyond all bearing absurd and
tormenting, Pat!” continued Agnes, with a
contemptuous toss of her head; “ but I may
at least venture with impunity to ask, were
any of the ladies well dressed ?”

“ Clara Granville !”

“ That ends my curiosity on the subject of
your visit,” replied Agnes, angrily affecting to
yawn. “ Never try to persuade me you care
for Clara. She is the most unflirtable girl in
the world! As cold as a statue of ice in an
east wind! She has the most tiresome style
of prettiness that can be conceived, with that.
alabaster paleness, that petrifying calmness of
manner, and a heart like a cucumber! The

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 269

very style of her dress is wearying, with not a
colour that one could give a name to; and
then her long under-toned téte-4-téte conver-
sations about nobody knows what, as dull and
monotonous as a dinner-bell, never enlivened
with a bit of gossip, nor spiced with any scan-
dal! There is a whole ‘ Society for the sup-
pression of vice’ in her eye every time she
looks at one! She would ovidently be terrified
for the echo of her own voice, and never yet
committed the indiscretion of a laugh !”

“ Are you done?” asked Sir Patrick, in a
tone of concentrated anger, which would have
silenced any one but Agnes.

“ Done! I could speak for two hours with-
out telling you half how little I think of Clara
Granville!” said she, in a paroxysm of elo-
quence. “One comfort is, however, she will
never take !”

“ But Clara has already ‘ taken, as you
elegantly express yourself,” exclaimed Sir
Patrick, who had been walking vehemently
up and down the room during this tirade from
Agnes, and now stood opposite to her, with a

270 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

look of angry defiance. “ Clara is surpassing-
ly lovely! Her portrait should be the frontis-
piece to Finden’s next Book of Beauty! She
has the loveliness of a seraph !”

“ Certainly, if you mean that she looks as
if the first breath of wind would blow her
down! like an overgrown geranium, that
should be tied up to a, stick !”

“Clara is delicate and graceful as the first
frail blossoms of spring,” interrupted Sir
Patrick. “She has but one fault in the
world, and that is, being faultless! Clara is
worth a whole creation of ordinary girls!
That look of mild serenity, and those deep,
thoughtful eyes, looking as serene as the blue
firmament above. Her every attitude is what
a Guido might have delighted to paint. Ag-
nes, there is music and rapture in every tone
of her voice! At Lady Towereliffe’s no one
was looked at, nor spoken to, but Miss Gran-
ville! She stole into all hearts, without any
man guessing his danger till too late! Every-
body admired, or, I should rather say, loved
her !”

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 271

“ You are ‘everybody,’ then, I suppose, for
I never heard of any one else, who for half a
moment thought her tolerable, All this non-
sense is merely to tease me, Pat. Do confess
it at once, and be serious !”

“That I never am when I can help it !”

“ Well, then, let it always be a jest, and I
have no objection to call up a laugh, if it be
your humour; but I would engage to walk
out of the world at once, whenever Clara has
a serious, downright proposal from any pre-

* sentable-looking man, such as one would not
be ashamed to sit in a room with !”

“ What do you think of me, Agnes?” ask-
ed Sir Patrick, walking straight up to her
and looking his sister full in the face, with
a momentary attempt to be facetious, while
his countenance betrayed considerable agita-
tion. ‘“ Would you be much astonished if I
had made her an offer?”

“ Nonsense, Pat! I would disown you: for
a brother! Now, do not look like an ogre
atme! You will say any absurdity in jest !”

“You know, Agnes, I have been a month

272 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

in the house lately with Clara!” replied Sir
Patrick, in a voice which sounded by no
means like jest; “and that month was more
than a lifetime in showing me the worth of
a real and heartfelt attachment. Even I,
mercenary as I am, could value it more than
gold! Idate the beginning of my existence
from the hour I first knew her. There is a
depth of mind and heart in the character
of Clara Granville, utterly incomprehensible
to ordinary observers. She does everything
well, and says everything with a grace pecu-
liarly her own. Her manner is the very
essence of fascination. Every other person
seems coarse and vulgar in comparison; and
T even feel so myself! I know you will treat
me to a cannonade of abuse against Clara;
but that is no matter now,” added Sir Pa-
trick, in a tone of deep dejection; “perhaps
it may do me good !”

“Wonders occur every hour of every day,
but this is the greatest of all!” observed
Agnes, drily. “TI never thought you would
commit such a piece of disinterested non-

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 278

sense, as to fall in love, gratis, with any
penniless girl, and least of all with Clara.
Tf you were to choose among all the young
ladies I know, blindfold, you could scarcely
choose any one more unsuitable! If this in-
deed be true, Clara may be proud of her con-
quest !”

“She ought!” replied Sir Patrick, glanc-
ing at his own magnificent head in a mirror ;
“but being in many respects peculiar, she by
no means appreciated the honour as you ex-
pect !”

“ You are possessed by the very genius of
nonsense to-day, Pat! but if such a catch as
you were to fall in Clara Granville’s way, I
should like to see her, and all her family, not
more than happy on the occasion !”

“ Well then! open your ears of astonish-
ment, Agnes! She has actually rather re-
fused me than otherwise! I am positively
more in love with Clara, than language can
express! I could pursue her to the very
ends of the earth! I must, and shall marry
her! I would shoot myself to-morrow, if I

274 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

thought there could bea doubt of it,” exelaim-
ed Sir Patrick, vehemently, while Agnes be-
came gradually as grave as night. “Clara
at first actually accepted me! She was your
sister-in-law elect, for three long and happy
weeks, and I did not think life could have
given me so much to live for; but she after-
wards most perversely and unaccountably re-
yoked! What do you think was the reason,
Agnes, of all reasons in the world”

“Tam bad at guessing absurdities,” repli-
ed Agnes, who would have hurled a more
angry answer at her brother, had she dared.
“Whatever might be the cause, it was very
lucky for you, who may, if you know your
own value, make the first match in the king-
dom !”

“Well, then! actually that she thought
my religious principles not sufficiently seri-
ous! That her brother disapproved of my
morals and conduct! I offered her any
terms! To attend chapel with her once
every Sunday ; to refrain from Sunday din-
ners, and Sunday travelling! Not even to

short, to pass Sir Andrew's whole Sunday
bill in my house; but it did not satisfy her !
What would they have !” continued Sir Pa-
trick, gnawing his lip with vexation. “1
gave her a carte blanche to put my name
down as a subscriber to as many tract, mis-
sionary, and slave-abolition societies, as she
pleased, and asked her how many distressed
families she wished me to maintain.”

“How excessively handsome!” said Agnes,
satirically. “All I need say is, it was very
genteel !”

“Yet Clara persevered in giving me a
plump decline! No wonder you look incre-
dulous! I ean scarcely yet believe it myself!
This shall not last, however! I felt: piqued
at first, and left her. I am always too soon,
or too late, in all I do; but it must be tried
again and again! I would rather live with-
out the sun and stars, than without Clara
Granville! The very repetition of her name
is a pleasure! Agnes, what can you do to

assist me !”

276 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

“ Assist! I shall do everything in the
world to bring you back to your senses,
Pat! Rather than see that grave, prig-
gish, matter-of-fact Clara, my sister-in-law,
I would —.”

Agnes could not, at the moment, think of
any illustration sufficiently strong to exem-
plify her abhorrence of such a catastrophe,
and twisted her ringlets over her finger for
some moments, in dignified and portentous
silence. At length she said, with an air of
supreme contempt, “ You know, Pat! Clara
Granville has not a shilling in the wide
world !—never had! At school she used to
be like a bale of cotton from the manufacto-

 

ries ; cotton stockings, pink gingham frocks,
and horrid grey beaver gloves! She once
had a silk dress, and it was turned, I think,
three times !”

“ Fiddlesticks and nonsense! So much the
better! She will be an excellent wife for a
poor man; and poor enough I shall soon be!
You need not argue with a milestone, but
put a good face on the matter in time, Agnes;

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 277

for during all the four thousand years that
men have been falling in love, and marrying,
I believe no one ever did so merely to please
his sister, and I am not the man to begin!
In most respects, I may, perhaps, be sordidly
anxious for money, but in*the matter of love
IT have taken the whim of being disinterested.
If Clara had the Bank of England for her
portion, I could not love her more. As for
heiresses, I hear that the only one worth a
thought, Miss Howard Smytheson, with her
million a-year, is bespoke to order for De
Crespigny.”

“Perhaps he has taken the whim of being
disinterested also!” replied Agnes, arranging
a favourite curl with great complacency at
the mirror. “His uncle is very arbitrary;
and like all uncles, continues for ever to think
his nephew a perfect boy. He threatened
lately to marry himself, if Captain De Cres-
pigny declined! That old dot has some
spirit! He seems not to be aware that
there is such a thing in the world for him-
self as a refusal; and certainly, Pat, I can

278 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

scarcely fancy the woman in existence who
could refuse you. I hardly know whether to
wonder most that Clara had the opportunity,
or that she had the inclination !

“The whim will wear off! She loves me,
that is certain; but if she even hated me, it
would make no difference in my attachment.
I like her the better for showing some spirit,
and great disinterestedness. Clara’s conduct
was, like herself, beautiful. Her affections
are mine! I sce it, and no earthly power
ean tear her from me! I would follow her
to the very grave.”

Sir Patrick did not by any means find
Clara’s resolutions, which were formed upon
principle, of such very malleable materials as
he had prophesied. His own feelings were,
on all occasions, like a whirlwind; and his
eagerness, excited to excess by opposition,
became unbounded to meet Clara, or to catch
the most distant glimpse of her shadow,—but
in vain. Day after day he contrived to pass
beneath her window, but she had adopted
invisibility ; and evening after evening, he

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 279

obliged Agnes, greatly against her inclina-
tion, to send the very kindest notes of invi-
tation, which he dictated himself, asking her
to the house; but the polite apology which
was invariably returned, might almost have
been lithographed, it became so frequently ne-
cessary ; yet still Sir Patrick persevered and
hoped, saying one day, in a voice of irritabi-
lity and depression, to Agnes, “It seems as if
we were neyer destined to see Olara again !”

“That would be too much happiness,”
exclaimed Agnes peevishly ; twisting Clara’s
last reply into a thousand shapes and tossing
it into the fire. “ This is all so like you,
Pat! You invent a thousand reasons for
wishing something till it is obtained, and
then you care for it no more! If Clara
Granville consented, you would be, like Sir
Peter Teazle, ‘the most miserable man
alive before people were done wishing you
joy! Men are all so changeable and selfish!”

“ Whether are men or women most selfish,
I should like to know?”

“Men, decidedly! From six years old,

280 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

till sixty, they seem born and brought up to
think of no one’s comfort but their own, and
they always marry to please themselves !”

“ Of course! and very right they should !”

Agnes had now got upon a favourite subject
of declamation, the selfishness of mankind,—
for those who are selfish or ill-tempered
themselves, live always under the delusion
that they are the only persons living entirely
exempt from such faults,—but her eloquence
now soon left her “in possession of the
house,” as Sir Patrick made a rapid retreat,
followed by that very effective slamming of
the door, so infallible a receipt for obtaining
the last word in an argument, and for assert-
ing in undoubted terms, a very decided view
of the subject in question.

Though Sir Patrick Dunbar had long been
known as a Tattersall and Doncaster man,
yet Clara Granville had little suspected that

severely to censure the peceadilloes of the
handsomest and most agreeable man in their
circle of society, living only for the enjoyment
of the senses and the happiness of the present
hour, while he thought it too long a look-out
to anticipate what might happen the day
after to-morrow. In respect to Sir Patrick’s
reputation, a vague understanding seemed to
prevail that all was not right, yet no explicit
explanation seemed ever to be obtained.

Something there was —— what, none presumed to say,
Clouds lightly passing as the summer day.

There are not only faults in the very best
characters, but redeeming qualities also in the
very worst, and with much selfishness, the
result of a perverted education, the handsome
and fascinating Sir Patrick had naturally a
good temper and excitable affections, though
these were wound up occasionally to the
wildest excess, while his fortune was not more
recklessly squandered than his attachment in

* the momentary impulse of an hour.
As, therefore, no man is so thoroughly ex-

cellent as to be without errors, neither is any
living mortal so depraved as to be without
virtues, and the utmost extreme, in one re-
spect or the other, will only be perfected in
an eternal world. It often seems to an ob-
server, as if two opposite beings had been
kneaded into one, since qualities so contradic-
tory may be traced in the same individual.
Though Sir Patrick Dunbar was eager and
rapacious in acquiring money, and would in-
cur any meanness to avoid paying it, he seem-
ed, nevertheless, lavish, and what some people
mis-called generous, in squandering what he
called his own. Though cold and selfish in
general, some fine impulses had been in his
nature, which proved him capable of vehe-
ment, persevering, and passionate attachment,
where his affections, or rather his faney, had
been once engaged ; while, at the same time,
he was more ashamed to testify any feeling
than he would have been to commit a crime,
and endeavoured to blind people towards
that sensibility which was in reality the re-
deeming point in his character, by talking

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 283

often with the utmost contempt and even
ridicule of all those for whom he might have
been supposed to feel the weakness of a real
attachment.

Sir Patrick had indeed been, what his com-
panions called, “fairly caught” by Clara;
and his heart, till now hermetically sealed
against all real confidence and friendship,
was now for the first time unclosed, in its in-
most recesses, while even his hackneyed mind
seemed to catch a ray of light and warmth
from the sunny freshness and purity of Clara’s
intellectual mind. Her intelligent conversa-
tion, enlivened by a vein of sly pleasing
humour, had completely taken him by sur-
prise, being as fresh and gentle as a summer
breeze, while her appearance, so young, timid,
and lovely, caused the eye to rest on her with
a sentiment of almost melancholy interest.
Clara had only emerged from school, finally,
a few days before Sir Patrick met her at
Lady Towercliffe’s, and her extreme natveté
was her first attraction, though that was
superseded before long by still greater ad-

284 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

miration, while he became hourly more fasci-
nated by her melancholy songs and thought-
ful conversation.

To Clara, Sir Patrick had only hitherto
been known as a school companion of her
brother’s, but so conscientiously did Richard
Granville invariably abstain from evil-speak-
ing, that, even where justice might have war-
ranted the severest censure, he merely became
silent. It is observable that, in the wisdom of
Providence, nothing is made in vain, Even
the very weeds that encumber our path have,
when under proper restraint, their important
uses, and in the mind of man, the tendency
implanted by nature, to discuss and criticize
the conduct of others, has, when properly ex-
ercised, its own advantages, by acting as a
salutary restraint on the conduct of those
who would otherwise do evil with impunity,
and by also giving a timely warning, and
hanging out a beacon-light to those who
would otherwise trust their interest and hap-
piness where such confidence was unmerited,
and where all contact is dangerous.

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 285

Captain De Crespigny’s jilting propensities
were the less dangerous, from their being so
generally discussed in society, as few were
willing that the unwary should suffer, rather
than his faults be exposed to censure; but
Mr Granville, by not giving his sister timely
warning against the dissipated extravagance
and almost infidel principles of his old school-
companion, had now unfortunately exposed
her to a danger he had not anticipated, as it
never occurred to his imagination, in its wild-
est fancies, that the reckless dissolute Sir
Patrick, who had long sneered at marriage,
and even broken that holy tie for others,
might find a charm in the pure, calm, high-
minded Clara, which raised him above his
ordinary self, and made him appear all she
could most like or admire. During their
earlier intercourse she saw nothing in his con-
versation to disapprove, because Sir Patrick
most unintentionally deceived her into a be-
lief of his being very different from what
he really was, owing to the respect with
which he treated all her opinions, and only

286 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

when he talked to others did she become
startled occasionally by the tone of careless
defiance with which he spoke of all those per-
sons and things which she was most accus-
tomed to reverence and esteem. Before long
his attachment had become so unbounded
that, conscious he could not obtain Clara’s
hand if she knew his real character, he as-
sumed all that seemed most likely to secure
her confidence, and, for the pleasure of being
with her, attended church regularly on Sun-
day at the village. Clara was astonished at
his evident ignorance of the forms of devo-
tion; yet knowing his education had been
finished by a clergyman, she supposed he
must have imbibed a due respect for the or-
dinances; while Lady Towercliffe, indulging
her usual jobbing propensities, was enchanted
to make up a match of any kind in her own
house, and praised Sir Patrick as the most
immaculate and perfect of men.

Clara’s intimacy with Sir Patrick had been
continually increasing for some time, before
his attention became so very obvious as to ex-

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 287

cite her peculiar interest, or to make her con-
scious of a necessity for inquiring into the
state of her own heart; but, upon doing so,
she became instantly aware of the deep hold
he had aequired over her thoughts and affee-
tions. His frank, off-hand, good-humoured
manner had pleased her, his amusing conver-
sation had enlivened her, and at length his
ardent professions of attachment interested
her deeply, being expressed with all the elo-
quence of natural feeling.

Clara, in the gloomy recesses of Mrs Pen-
fold’s school-room, had learned nothing of the
world, and her heart at once, therefore, en-
dowed Sir Patrick with all those amiable
qualities which he assumed, while she yielded
herself to the most pleasing of all earthly
dreams, that of loving and being beloved by
one who seemed to deserve and to return her
attachment; while her sole hesitation in ac-
cepting the offer he soon after made of his
hand, arose from her doubts whether, in the
chief essential to mutual happiness, in reli-
gious faith, hope, and morality, they were so

288 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

far of similar mind as to afford a well-ground-
ed prospect of happiness.

In almost undoubting confidence of a satis-
factory answer, Clara wrote to consult her
brother, then studying for holy orders at
Oxford, in whose opinion, on all occasions,
she implicitly relied; and it was with grief and
astonishment, which no words could describe,
that she received a reply, in which Mr Gran-
ville, with affectionate earnestness reproached
himself for not having explicitly laid open to
her the character of his former companion
and ci-devant friend, who was, he grieved to
say, a ruined gamester, a bankrupt in fame, as
much as in fortune, dreaded by the most re-
spectable among women, and shunned by the
most respectable among men, even by his
kind, indulgent, but high-minded uncle, Sir
Arthur. An open scoffer frequently at the
decencies of life, and still more at its most
sacred duties and hopes. “ Sir Patrick makes
no secret of his profligacy,” continued Mr
Granville, “showing the most flagrant dis-
honesty in the only way a gentleman can be

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 289

tempted to do so, by not paying his debts,
while many poor tradesmen have already been
ruined by his extravagance, and he has openly
entered into a perfect crusade against religion
and morality. In short, my dear Clara, Sir
Patrick is by no means to be trusted with the
happiness of another, and least. of all with
yours, being a confirmed roué, still pursuing
the very wildest career of unprineipled dis-
sipation. Many have already had reason to
mourn they ever trusted him or knew him,
for he is the very reverse of all you believe
and wish. It would be extravagant to waste
a hope upon the reformation of a reckless
libertine, who thus outrages every law of God
and man, and often have you and I agreed,
that it was a thing not to be conceived, a
woman who rightly valued her immortal soul,
placing herself under the authority and influ-
ence of a husband who did not! The risk is
too great, and how much better to suffer now
the sorrow of a separation, than to endure the
long agony of an unsuitable union, for which
your own heart and conscience would conti-

nually upbraid you. If the tenderest affee-
tion of a brother can in any degree compen-
sate for the sacrifice, you need not be told,
my dear Clara, that I shall bestow it upon you
more lavishly than ever, and it will be my first
earthly wish, as well as my sacred duty, to
render you happier than you could ever be
with a man of principles ——, or rather of no
principles, —— like Sir Patrick.”

Had the grave opened at Clara’s feet, she
could scarcely have been more startled and
astonished, than by the contents of this most
unforeseen letter, the first unwelcome line ever
received from Richard. She could have borne
anything but to find her lover unprincipled or
unworthy, and a wintry chill seemed to ga-
ther round her heart, while, with a stifled
groan which struggled for utterance, she cover-
ed her face with her hand, and sank back
upon a sofa. By a powerful effort Clara pre-
served herself from fainting,—she was resolved
not to faint, and she did not,—but in the
secret chamber of her heart, all was darkness,
loneliness, and grief. Visions of earthly hap-

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 291

piness had glittered for a time in brightest
colouring before her mind, but now they must
be blotted out by her tears. They all lay
prostrate and disfigured at her feet, scorch-
ed and blasted as if by lightning, and her
heart, bewildered by a multitude of thoughts
and emotions, seemed full almost to burst
ing.

Clara wept many bitter tears over her let-
ter, and she not only wept but acted. With-
out delay, Clara prepared to return to the
relation with whom, during her brother’s ab-
sence, she usually found a home; and before
her departure, not only wrote to Sir Patrick,
stating in terms of touching grief, all her rea-
sons for so suddenly and unwillingly withdraw-
ing from her engagement to him; but. she had
along and most afflicting interview with him,
vainly endeavouring to convince her lover, that
their total incompatibility of sentiment raised
a barrier between them, which forbade the
possibility of their union.

Sir Patrick became nearly frantic with vex-
ation, while he could not but admire the

292 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

beautiful grace of her manner, and the sor-
rowful modulations of her voice when she
spoke, yet unconscious how completely the
gentle Clara was ruled by principle as with a
sceptre of iron, he seemed utterly unable to
comprehend why his talking carelessly, or even
contemptuously of religion, should in any de-
gree affect the preference which she had once
confessed for him, and which he felt assur-
ed she still entertained. With passionate
vehemence he urged the depth of his at-
tachment, and his total indifference to every-
thing in life but herself, while he warmly pro-
tested that she, and she only, could complete
the reformation which her own influence had
already begun.

“You love me, Clara, and would cast me
off for ever! Impossible! Let us forget all
my early indiscretions,—my vices then if it
must be so,—but why should every leaf of my
past life be turned over now! Since we met I
have been an altered being !_I am astonished
even at myself! If I have deceived you, it is
because I deceived myself, but now I am en-

tirely in your power. Use it then kindly, and
forget all but my attachment; I have staked
my whole happiness in life on the hope of your
accepting me. The wish to deserve you shall
be a sufficient motive to fit me for all the
duties of life. Without you.I shall have no
object, no hope, not even a home, for never
more shall I have one unless you share it.
Clara, let me throw myself on your compas-
sion, if not on your love.”

“ Oh no !” said Clara, hurriedly, yet with a
look of pale and tearful distress, “ I dare not
hesitate ! All must be as I‘have said. It will
be most for the happiness of both !”

“ Happiness ! speak not to me of happiness
without you! It isa mockery! Every tic to
peace or virtue would then be ruptured.”

“There are better ties to virtue, and
stronger,” whispered Clara, in a faltering
voice, while she gasped for utterance, and a
glow like sunset was on her cheek.

“No! no! not for me! There may be
amusement, frivolity, gayety, and dissipation;
but I never understood the real meaning of

294 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

happiness till we met. My whole thoughts,
feelings, and character have been revolution-
ised to please you, Clara, but your influence
alone could snatch me from evil,—from my-
self,—from all on which I have hitherto wasted
my existence. For your sake, and for yours
alone, I could be all, and more than you wish.
Years spent in your society shall prove the
extent of your influence.”

“ By trusting to such a hope, many, like me,
have wrecked their whole peace both now and
hereafter,” said Clara, trying to speak with
firmness, but her voice became almost inau-
dible. “If it were the same thing to will, as
to do, I have not a doubt of your sincerity;
but the mere resolution to change established
habits, unless the power be derived from
above, is only an air-built castle to which I
dare not trust. It would be easy still to in-
dulge myself in romantic schemes of domestic
happiness, such as I have lately anticipated,
but these hopes could only be blossoms with-
out root or durability, unless they arise from
firm principles of religion. Without such a

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 295

cement happiness has neither worth nor dura-
bility.”

“Clara! you have never loved as I do!”
exclaimed Sir Patrick, reproachfully. “ I
never did, and never can express half what I
feel; but you do not yet know the heart you
so cruelly undervalue! It seems now as if you
would rather cut off your hand than bestow it
on me!”

“ Perhaps in future years—” stammered
Clara. “We are both young; and if, for
your own sake, you alter in some respects, we
might yet look forward to—to—”

“Speak not of delay! that is worse than
death! I never in my life could endure sus-
pense! No!.it must—it shall be now, or
never !”

“ Never, then,” replied Clara, in a low,
husky, indistinet voice, while, in spite of her-
self, tears rolled over her face. “ It ought
indeed to be never! Forget me, as if I were
already dead! I must only consent to pass my
life with a confirmed and consistent Christian,
completely master of himself and of his, ac-

tions. If we lived for each other, I should
have a thousand anxieties, regrets, and sor-
rows, which you could neither foresee nor un-
derstand! Oh no! I must only love on earth
one whom I may hope to love hereafter for
ever !”

“ Must it be my misfortune, Clara, to have
known you?” exclaimed Sir Patrick, with agi-
tated energy. “Do you not see that with
me, to know excellence is to love it, and that
if we wero constantly together, I should al-
ways be like you. The loss of honour, for-
tune, or reputation, I might endure; but your
loss I cannot, and will not. Tell me, then,
are my whole affections to be buried in dark-
ness, never to see a dawn?”

“Tf my happiness in this world only were
at hazard, I would venture all for your sake !”
replied Clara, in a low, gentle, tremulous voice.
“TJ feel grateful for your attachment—more
than grateful; but marriage is so very awful
and sacred a tie! to devote every earthly
thought, every feeling, every hope, every hour
of my life to one! I could not and dare not

enter on such a duty, without a perfect and
unalterable confidence. I feel, that to be
united in love and duty where I did not
esteem, is a misfortune I could not survive—
which I could seareely even wish to survive.
In giving you my heart, as I have already
done, I ventured my all of worldly happiness
on that one stake, and have lost it; but there
are better hopes and higher duties, which bind
me to follow them, even though death were
the consequence.”

Sir Patrick clenched his hands vehement-
ly together, while his countenance burned,
and muttering a curse between his teeth,
which chilled the blood of Clara in her vei
he walked about the room with rapidly in-
creasing excitement, till at length, stopping

  

before her, he said in accents of angry re-
proach, “ You have spoken my doom, Clara ;
and only from your own lips would I have
believed it.”

Clara buried her face in her hands, and
feeling that her high-wrought fortitude was
giving way, she hurried towards the door ;

298 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

but as she tremblingly endeavoured to open
it, Sir Patrick again seized her hand, saying,
“You are mine, Clara; yoy are bound by a
promise that must not be broken !”

«I shall never give myself to another,” said
she, still hastening away. ‘“ Be happy in
making others happy. May you yet find one
who loves you as I have done, and who shall
not hereafter find the same reasons for giving
you up. I shall pray for you, and rejoice in
all the good I hear. Farewell.”

No words could do justice to the silent
agony of Clara’s young heart, when in solitary
grief she retraced her whole intimacy with Sir
Patrick, and reflected that she had bid a last,
adieu to one whom she must not esteem, and
yet could not but love. All that this world
could offer she had rejected for conscience
sake. A cold frost seemed to gather around
her spirit, while trembling and depressed, she
viewed the desolation of all her lately cherish-
ed hopes; and amidst the ruined fabric of her
happiness, she now seemed like some solitary
pillar, surrounded by the broken fragments of

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 299

what once supported and adorned it; yet
summoning to her aid that Christian firmness,
which in her amounted to heroism, she gazed
on the shattered wreck, without a wish to re-
store it at the sacrifice of principle, determin-
ed, as far as her sensitive nature would ad-
mit, to adopt the rule of an aged and expe-
rienced Christian, “ Hope nothing, fear no-
thing, expect anything, and be prepared for
everything !”

CHAPTER X.

‘Thus always teasing others, always teased,
The only pleasure is, to be displeased.”
Cowren.

Years having thus rolled on, bringing joy to
some, and laying sorrow more or less on all,
Marion Dunbar, frosh in the spring-tide of
youthful bloom, had nearly completed her
seventeenth year, and was hurrying on still
in a whirlpool of education at Mrs Penfold’s,
exerting herself more zealously for the credit
of her teachers than she ever would have done
for her own.

One evening about this time, a message
reached Marion, desiring that she would in-
stantly hasten to Mrs Penfold’s private sit-

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 301

ting-room, which was on all extraordinary oc-
casions that lady’s hall of: audience, and a
solemn summons to which was usually of omi-
nous import. Marion, however, conscious
that her own recent diligence had been quite
pre-eminent, and her success most distin-
guished, heard the word of command with a
flutter of pleasing anticipation, for to her the
future was always full of hope. Too old now
for medals and ribbons, she yet indulged in
the gay recollection of former triumphs, and
remembered, with a smile, as she hurried up
stairs, how often Sir Arthur had formerly de-
clared, while pretending to frown upon her,
that “he hated to see girls flouncing about
with medals, and defying the world!” yet how
slily, when she one day entered his drawing-
room, with deepening colour, and a look of
modest consciousness, half concealing and
half displaying her honours, he had advanced
to meet her, wearing his own Grand Cross of
the Bath, to prove, as he said, that he was
indeed fit eompany for so meritorious a young
lady.

302 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

Humming a favourite air, with a buoyant
joyful step, and radiant smile, Marion hasten-
ed to the door of Mrs Penfold’s apartment,
where, after trying to compose her features
into a suitable expression of sober respect,
with dimpling cheek, and still almost laugh-
ing eyes, she entered, making, as she had been
taught, the usual respectful courtesy exacted
by Mrs Penfold, such as might have been suit-
able for an introduction at Court, or for a
public performer receiving the plaudits of a
numerous audience, and then, with a bright
speaking look, full of hope and vivacity, she
paused, to ascertain the object of her unex-
pected summons,

To Marion’s astonishment and dismay, Mrs
Penfold was pacing about the room, evidently
in a state of furious irritation, while in her
hand she carried that endless bill, the growth
of many years, for board, education, masters,
and sundries, which had so often already.
greeted the unwilling eyes of her young pu-
pil, whose whole inward spirit recoiled with
shame and apprehension, while she silently

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 308

measured the length and breadth of its con-
tents, every item of which she already knew
by heart, and could almost have reeapitulated
without a prompter.

Had Marion herself been a ruined gamester
or a spendthift, she could scarcely have felt
more guilty and ashamed than now; but af-
ter standing an entire minute without being
observed, and perceiving Mrs Penfold un-
able to speak, from the effort it cost to re-
strain her anger within decent bounds, Marion,
with the frankness natural to her candid dis-
position, came at once to the point, saying,
with heightened colour, and scarcely articulate
voice, while her beautiful deep intelligent eyes
were fixed with an earnest gaze on Mrs Pen-
fold.

“ T fear no satisfactory answer has come
this term from my brother ?”

“No! nor there never will be!” thundered
Mrs Penfold, in a voice that made the gentle
Marion absolutely cower before her. “ There,
Miss Dunbar ! look at that bill!” added she,
flinging it furiously into the lap of Marion,

304 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

who had sunk upon a seat. “ How much
will a shilling in the pound be for that? Four
hundred guineas absolutely lost—wasted—
squandered upon you!”

Unable to speak from consternation, though
such scenes were already but too familar to
her memory, Marion fixed her eyes on the un-
welcome bill, apparently examining its con-
tents, while her thoughts were in the mean time
painfully oceupied in devising what would be
right for her to say or do in this unexpected
urisis. A long pause ensued, during which
Mrs Penfold seemed resolute not to speak ;
therefore Marion, with a strenuous effort, en-
deayoured to new-string her nerves, and say
something, while the large heavy tears forced
themselves into her eyes.

“ Mrs Penfold,” replied she earnestly,
“you know how ready I would be to send my
brother another letter of remonstrance, if
that could be of any avail, but now he never
so much as answers me. I seem indeed to be
quite forgotten by both Patrick and Agnes !”

Marion paused to recover her voice, and to

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 305

choke back her tears, after which she con-
tinued in a firmer tone, while Mrs Penfold
listened, with a dry, harsh, unmoved expres-
sion of countenance.

“ You are justly dissatisfied about my
brother's payments, but if there be the least
cause to doubt your being ultimately remune-
rated, send me immediately home. I dare
not go of myself, but you have power to dis-
miss me, and let it be done. The sorrow and
mortification must all be mine, but whatever
falls on myself alone, I shall always be able
to bear.”

“ Miss Dunbar! you have anticipated ex-
actly what I am obliged to do, and what it
would have been well for me if I had done

sooner !” replied Mrs Penfold, angrily flounc-
ing into a chair, and pirouetting it almost
round, so as to look Marion full in the
face. “ I am sorry for you certainly, because,
though your music is not yet exactly such as
to do me much credit, and your Italian is,
sometimes far from grammatical, yet on the
whole there cannot be a better-disposed girl,

306 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

nor one who has testified a more constant de-
sire to please me.”

Marion’s heart was melted by even this
very slight expression of regard, and nothing
could exceed the troubled beauty of her eyes,
when she raised them gratefully to Mrs Pen-
fold, but conscious that her presence was not
exactly the place for a scene, as that lady had
long been considered incapable of a tear or a
smile, she averted her face, and struggled for
composure.

“ T have learned for the first time to-day,”
resumed Mrs Penfold, her voice becoming
more stern as she proceeded, “ that before
your father’s death, Sir Patrick twice, in the
most profligate manner, paid off his creditors
with a shilling in the pound! In consequence
of great losses now at the Doncaster races,
and having paid what he calls his debts of ho-

«nour to a ruinous amount, Sir Patrick has
yesterday fled to the sanctuary at Holyrood
House for refuge, and the creditors have al-
ready seized everything. No wonder indeed !
it was full time! He is all promise and no

performance,—for ever feeding us with empty
spoons !”

Mrs Penfold angrily changed her position,
and with another indignant glance at Marion,
continued,

“Even Sir Patrick’s Jarge rent-roll would
scarcely suffice in a life-time to pay the half
of us off. Good worthy Sir Arthur too, his
own uncle, he has cheated, and the property
being entailed, we have only Sir Patrick’s life
to depend upon for what he owes us! This
is a very heavy blow to me, and extremely
hard to bear !”

While thus bemoaning herself, Mrs Pen-
fold forgot, like most selfish people, that any
one had to suffer besides, though the parted
lips, the tearful eyes, and the pallid cheek of
Marion testified in a language not to be mis-
taken, the depth and intensity of her grief,
while with astonishment and dismay, she
heard this short summary of Sir Patrick's
history and circumstances.

Long after Mrs Penfold had ceased to
speak, Marion gazed in her face, as if expect-

308 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

ing more, while her every nerve continued
quivering with agitation, till at length she
closed her eyes in speechless agony, bewilder-
ed by the sudden transition from joyful anti-
cipation to blank despair. Formerly she had
heard of difficulties and bankruptcies, as she
had heard of the plague or the bow-string at
Constantinople—things dreadful to those who
might be affected by them, but quite foreign
to herself, and now, like a clap of thunder, all
had suddenly burst over the heads of those
who were nearest and dearest to her, with ap-
parently destructive effect. She yet felt as if
the whole were some hideous dream from
which it might be possible to awaken,—the
voice of Mrs Penfold rang painfully on her
ears,—every surrounding object faded from
her vision,—her thoughts became confused,—.
a vague sense of burning misery was at her
heart,—and one only wish remained distinctly
prominent on her mind—the wish to be
alone.

“Indeed, Miss Dunbar,” continued Mrs

Penfold, in a monotonous complaining voice,

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 309

“no wonder you are shocked that I who have
laboured so hard to realise a small independ-
ence, should be swindled out of it in this way
by your brother. Lady Towereliffe tells me
that among his intimate friends he is known

on account of his having so often already
played a similar game, but once catch him
beyond the bounds of Holyrood now, and
he'll never be at liberty to try such ma-
noeuvres again. We are to offer a reward of
1.500 for his apprehension !”

“ My poor uncle and Agnes!” exclaimed
Marion, in a voice of anguish, while hot tears
fell like rain over her cheek, and a confused
apprehension of ruin, bankruptcy, and dis-
grace hovered darkly through her mind, though
she scarcely yet knew what to think or to
fear. “I must go home, if I yet have a
home! Wherever they are, let me find them !
I must see my uncle,—Patrick cannot be all
you say! oh no! It is some dreadful mis-
take! Whatever happens, I trust and hope,
Mrs Penfold, you will be repaid. It shall be

310 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

my first earthly wish—my duty sooner or
later, to see it done! Now let me go in-
stantly home !”

Mrs Penfold most heartily seconded her
pupil’s desire to depart, while one of the hea-
viest pangs which Marion had to endure on
this occasion, sprang from the stern angry
coldness with which her ci-devant preceptress
appeared about to bid her a last farewell.

A tumult of gossiping wonder and eu-
riosity arose among the pupils, when it be-
came whispered that Marion was to “ leave”
on an hour's notice. Many questions were
asked, much astonishment was expressed, and
even a great deal of real sympathy excited,
but Marion shrank from the clamorous ex-
clamations of her young companions, who
could not so much as guess the measure and
depth of her misfortunes. Often had she
shared their sorrows, and willingly would she
have accepted any consolation they could
offer, but the worst of her trials could not be
spoken to mortal ears, and in lamenting for
her brother’s disgrace, she could only bear

her wound, like a stricken deer, into solitude
and silence.

There are insects that live a life-time in an
hour, and it seemed to Marion as if she had
really done so, since the time when sparkling
with gladness, she flew to Mrs Penfold’s pre-
sence. Now, heavy with sorrow and anxiety,
she slowly retraced her steps, and on reach-
ing her room, sank upon the bed in a parox-
ysm of tears, delivering herself up to many
painful thoughts, or rather to her feelings, for
she could not think amidst the tumult of an
agitated mind, when suffering thus under the
most painful of all transitions, from hope to
despair.

It was during the unoccupied half-hour
after dinner, when Mrs Penfold allowed her
pupils a gasp of rest from their labours du-
ring the day, that they gathered in groups at
every window, to criticise a hackney-coach
and very tired broken-down looking horses in
waiting, while the pupils all watched for Ma-
rion’s departure, anxious to catch a last
glimpse of their favourite companion. She

had been shut up alone, ever since her inter-
view with Mrs Penfold, and tried to oceupy
horself in packing up her few possessions,
while endeavouring to compose her mind,
both of which tasks occupied more time than
she wished or expected. But all was now
over, and trying to assume an aspéct of se-
renity, with pale cheeks and swollen eyes, she
entered the school-room, carrying in her
hand a large and very heavy-looking casket.
The young community crowded round to
say a thousand affectionate farewells, when,
for a moment, Marion looked at them all
with her own beautiful smile, but unable to
control her emotion, she turned away her
head, and burst into an agony of tears.
“Miss Dunbar, my dear! the sooner this
is all over the better!” said Mrs Penfold,
hastily advancing, with a look of irritable
vexation. ‘No wonder you are sorry to
leave us; but what can’t be cured must be
endured. Remember to be diligent in prac-
tising your music, as the success of my esta-
blishment depends on the conduct of all my

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 313

young ladies, The only recompense I am
ever likely to receive for my care, will pro-
ceed from your attention not to do me any
discredit. Now, farewell, my dear, and try
to bear up the best way you can!”

“ Mrs Penfold!” faltered Marion, while
a flash of bright intelligence lighted up her
eyes; “allow me, for a single moment, to see
you alone!”

“No! no! my dear! I hate scenes;
therefore let us now take leave. I wish you
well!” added Mrs Penfold, in a tone that
sounded marvellously sincere. “I really do !
Whatever has happened is your misfortune,
not your fault !”

“One single word, if you please,” whisper-
ed Marion, colouring the deepest carnation,
and leading the way to an inner room, while
Mrs Penfold followed, with an air of royal
condescension. ‘The fault is indeed, as you
kindly remark, not my own ; but for my sake,
Mrs Penfold, spare my brother’s name in all
you say. It gives me pleasure to think that

I can do something towards settling our ac-

count myself; and I would think no sacrifice
worth a thought, that enabled me to do so.
My mother’s trinkets were divided between
Agnes and me; besides which my dear kind
uncle has been lavish in his gifts. This gold
repeater cost a great sum, and that locket is
set in diamonds.”

“Well, my dear!” interrupted Mrs Pen-
fold, relaxing into a look of graciousness,
“such honourable sentiments show that you
have not been under my care in vain; and
though these pretty trifles are not equivalent
to what you owe, yet half a loaf is better
than no bread !”

“ All that I ever possessed, the gifts or
legacies of friends and relations, I leave in
pledge with you, Mrs Penfold, as an.assur-
ance, that if brighter days ever come, I would
redeem them at twenty times their value.
Keep these till then. Whatever ornaments
I might ever wear, would be a reproach till

ficiently discharged, and among these is what
1 owe to your care during many past years.”

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 315

The bright eyes of Marion were dimmed
with tears of sincerity and emotion, when she
concluded; and, placing the casket in Mrs
Penfold’s astonished hands, she hastened out
of the room. Giving a last long look at those
inanimate objects to which she had been ac-
customed, and feeling;that even to these she
could not without regret bid a final adieu,
Marion threw herself into the carriage, and
drove off, so overpowered with anguish and
anxiety respecting. her brother, that. she

CHAPTER XI.

The storm around might roar and rustle,

Borns.

Marion Dunbar being by no means an arrant
novel reader, knew nothing of those artificial
feelings which too often obliterate the reality.
Simple as a field-flower, her natural sensibi-
lity remain perfectly fresh and unimpaired,
while now, for the first time, experiencing the
withering disappointments, and blighting anx-
ieties of life.

As she drove slowly along towards the
sanetuary where Sm Patrick had taken re-

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 317

fuge, the most prominent apprehension on
her mind, was that of finding him on the eve
of imprisonment ; but she in some degree
consoled - herself by imagining the services
that in such cireumstances she might perhaps
be able to do him, and the privations she
could endure for his sake. The more proud,
overbearing, and arbitrary, he had hitherto
been, the more touching it appeared to her
affectionate spirit, that one who seemed born
to command, should now be so humbled ; and
impatiently did she long to prove, that, how-
ever all things might alter, yet, in prosperity
or adversity, in sickness or in health, she was
unchangeably the same; while her young
heart glowed with the paramount hope of at
last becoming useful to her brother, and
therefore welcome.

As she proceeded, visions of deep distress
and difficulty floated dimly through the mind
of Marion, who could not entirely close her
eyes against the iron truths, and stern reali-
ties of life, while considering how totally un-
suited her brother was, to endure the pri-

318 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

vation of a single luxury, and now he could
searcely have enough to command the most
ordinary necessaries.

In the mind of Marion, immediate starva-
tion, and going out as a governess, were the
two ideas that most prominently connected
themsélves with the consciousness of being
ruined ; for her conception of bankruptcy
was of the most terrifying description,

In the few novels she had ever seen, the
heroines could always support themselves by
selling their drawings; but Marion did. not
hope to gain an independent livelihood by
her slanting castles, and top-heavy trees,
though taking in plain work, or teaching
music, suggested themselves as possible re-
sources. Marion thought of arrests, bailiffs,
writs, and of the world come to an end.
The sunny hours of her life seemed suddenly
darkened, and she had grown old in a day!
in the simplicity of her heart, she imagined
that a ruined man of rank and fashion, was
like a ruined man in earnest ; obliged actu-
ally to reduce his establishment! to dismiss

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 319

his servants! to dispose of his equipages ! to
make an auction of his furniture! to part
with his plate! and really to live as if he were
in downright matter-of-fact earnest, poor!
“to exist,” as Sir Patrick onee contemptu-
ously said-of Richard Granville, “on two-
pence a-year, paid quarterly !”

The slow-moving haekney-coach ‘stopped at
last before the gate of Sir Patrick’s new resi-
dence, St John’s Lodge, a gloomy antique
villa near Holyrood House, : with gabled «win-
dows, stone balconies, richly: carved balus-
trades, and pointed roof, surrounded: by dusty
beech-trees, and formal yew hedges, clipped
into fifty unimaginable shapes. Marion was
surprised, on hastily alighting, to perceive the
whole house glittering with lights, and would
have supposed she had made some mistake,
had not the bell been instantly answered by
Sir Patrick’s own man, followed by the usual
three yellow-plush footmen.

“ Faithful creatures!” thought she, hay-
ing often heard of: old servants who insisted
on being retained for nothing; “amidst all

320 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

Patrick’s distress, this must indeed be grati-
fying

In a tumult of emotion, Marion, throwing
off her bonnet, rushed up a broad well-lighted
flight of stairs, while, wound up to a pitch
of heroism and romantic self-devotion, she
thought only of her brother, impatiently long-
ing to fly into his arms, and to express the
whole fulness of her affection, and the whole
depth of her sympathy. While her heart
sprang forward to meet him, she eagerly
threw open a door next the staircase, and
entered with a hurried and tremulous step;
but suddenly her eyes were dazzled and be-
wildered by the sight which met her agitated
glance, while for a moment. she became root-
ed to the floor, like one who had been stunned
by a sudden blow. Marion gazed without
seeing, and heard without knowing what was
said, so unexpected and surprising was the
scene to which she had thus suddenly intro-
duced herself !

A murmur of noise and gayety rang in her
ears, while the whole apartment was brilliant-

”

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 321

ly illuminated, and the first object which be-
came distinct to her vision was Sir Patrick,
seated at the head of a superbly-decorated
dinner-table, in a perfect uproar of merriment
and hilarity. Around him were placed five or
six of his gayest associates, dressed in their
scarlet hunting-coats, and evidently in joyous
spirits, like school-boys during the vacation,
while the whole party presented a most con-
vivial aspect, laughing in merry chorus, and
with claret circulating at full speed round the
hospitable board.

Marion felt as if her feet had lost all power
of motion, while, grasping the handle of the
door with one hand, and shading her eyes
with the other, she became transfixed to the
spot. It was a shock of unexpected joy, and
while standing in the deep embrasure of
the door, her large eyes dilated, and her
lips parted, with an expression of speech-
less amazement, she looked like a breath-
ing portrait, which an artist might have
shown as his master-piece,—young, bright,
and graceful, as the first crescent of the

322 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

moon, or like the fabled houri of an eastern
tale.

The gentlemen all instinctively stood up
with one accord the moment she appeared,
giving her looks of embarrassed astonish-
ment and admiration, while Marion hastily
retreating, in an agony of confusion, heard
her own voice inadvertently exclaim, “ Pat-
rick !”

“ Marion!” cried her brother, in a frenzy
of astonishment more than equal to her own,
while the flowing bumper which had been
raised to his lips remained suspended there,
and in an instant afterwards, his tone of sur-
prise became changed into angry imperative
remonstrance. “ Marion! what brought you
here, child?”

Before she had quite retreated, suspecting
the real state of the case, and not wishing for
any public explanation, Sir Patrick added, in
an accent of careless good-humour, “ Agnes
is up stairs dressing for the ball, so make
yourself scarce, and find her if possible. The
house is not large enough to puzzle any one

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 323

long, but I suppose you mistook this room for
hers !”

“ Patrick is not ruined after all!” thought
the delighted Marion, vanishing in a trans-
port of joy, while her brother's jovial compa-
nions becanie vehemently energetic in express-
ing their admiration of the beautiful appari-
tion.

“Can that be'the darling cherub Marion,
who used to call herself my little wife? - I
wish she may do 'so,in-earnest now! She is
undoubtedly the loveliest creature that my
sight ever looked: upon, :her eyes. glittering
like stars beneath that rich~ cloud. of» hair !
Let us drink a:bumper to her health !” ex-
claimed Captain De Crespigny, in a sponta-
neous impulse of enthusiasm, filling his glass,
and. singing in a fine, full-toned tenor, the
favourite ballad,

« T saw her but 2 moment,
‘And methinks I see: her yet,

‘With the wreath of summer flow’rs
Beneath her curls of jet.”

“ That must mean Agnes, for Marion’s

824 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

hair is brown,” interrupted Sir Patrick, in a
rallying tone, yet his manner betrayed the ex-
cited and exaggerated vivacity of one, who
evidently forced his spirits, endeavouring to-
banish care by ceasing to think. “Be con-
stant for one entire week, and I shall then
think Agnes has achieved a wonder in-
deed.”

“You do me injustice, Dunbar! I must
be allowed to beg your pardon! I have not
been what is called ‘in love’ above nine
times in my life! Well! you may laugh,—
anybody can laugh, but I consider that smile
of yours exceedingly malicious !”

“ When a man is on the ice, you know his
best safety is. to keep moving,” replied Sir
Patrick, dryly. “People talk of two strings
to their bow, De Crespigny, but you are never
satisfied under two dozen !”

“ Tant mieux et tant pis! As Rosainond
says, ‘Thou canst not tell yet, how many
fathoms deep I am in love;’ how concealment is
preying on my damask cheek, and what vio-
lent heart-quakes I am continually enduring !

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 325

The girl before last that I died for, was my
idol for an eternity of three months’ duration.
I might have continued most deplorably in
love yet, if she had not imprudently appeared
before me one day in an unbecoming east
wind, with considerably more colour in her
nose than in her cheek !”

“© You are the most observant of men, De
Crespigny! If you only pass a young lady at
full speed on a staircase, you can describe her
eyes, complexion, figure, and expression, be-
fore I could be certain whether she has one eye
or two! But what is this Irish story I heard
about you! Some lady with seven brothers,
and you threatened to shoot them all that. she
might become an heiress! What were the par-
ticulars?”

“ You seem to know more than I do, or
anybody else!” replied Captain De Crespigny,
hastily tossing off a bumper to conceal his con-
fusion. “ There’are so many girls whose
peace of mind I annihilate, that it is next to
impossible for me to remember them, but I
ean think of nothing now except my cousin

326 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

Marion, who always promised to be beautiful,
and has more than fulfilled her promise. Tell
me, Dunbar! when does that pearl come out
of the shell?”

“Tf you please, sir!” said a servant, enter-
ing, “ the hackney coachman is waiting to be
paid seven shillings for bringing Miss Dunbar
from Dartmore House!”

“ Let him wait all night if he chooses!” re-
plied Sir Patrick, angrily frowning away his
footman, “ as,the Irishman said, ‘may he live
till I pay him!’ Tell the man to call again to-
morrow,—and next day,—and the next,—to
come back in short, whenever he has nothing
else to do! Perhaps in a delirium of generosity
I may some day think of paying him.”

“ At our usual rate of payment, seven shil-
lings from you would be equal to L.7!" said
Captain De Crespigny, laughing, “let him put
it down to your account!”

“ Yes! I have already more creditors than
pence, therefore one more or less ean be of no
consequence! 'That fellow of mine is the most
officious rascal!—and he begins every sentence

the same, ‘ If you please sir, the plate-chest
has been robbed!” or, ‘ If you please, sir, the
bay mare is dead!’ But Iam never pleased to
pay when it: can be avoided, and especially
now. This is one of my moneyless days! My
banker’s bulletins continue unfavourable! I
cannot raise another shilling! The handle. of
the pump, is chained! All my relations have
made wills in my favour, but not one of them
will die!” As Falstaff says, ‘ What money’s
in my purse? seven groats and twopence!””

“ T shall set up a hackney coach, and drive
one myself if it pays so well!” exclaimed Cap-
tain De Crespigny indignantly, “‘ What an ex-
tortioner the fellow is! up to snuff and a pinch
above it! He deserves to be executed!”

“Don’t speak of executions in this house!
we have had enough of them already,” replied
Sir Patrick, -foreing a laugh which sounded
very like a stage laugh, “ What-brings me
here, if Iam to be dunned in the very sanc-
tuary by a set of rascally creditors! You can
take the hackney coach home, if the man waits
a few hours longer, De Crespigny, and pay

which of us is best off for ready money, but as
Jeremy Diddler says, ‘ You don’t happen to
have such a thing as teri-pence there, have

shilling! Money is a bore! As for you, Din-
bar, if you wished to borrow a glass of water,
I shall not be the man to lend it! I would not
for worlds be included among your ‘ rascally
creditors!’ ”

“They beset my door so incessantly the
week before we came here,” said Sir Patrick,
laughing, “ that 1 played the fellows an ad-
mirable trick by connecting a strong galvanic
battery with the knocker of the door, so that
the more angrily they grasped it, the stronger
was the shock they received. I sat with Wig-
‘ton for an hour at the window in perfect fits,
when we saw the look of astonishment and

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 329

terror with which, one after another, they
staggered away. One impudent rascal abso-
lutely succeeded in serving a writ upon me for
L.200, but happening to have as much in the
house, I thought it best for once to pay him
off, and a

“ That is a most remarkable story! almost
incredible!” exclaimed Captain De Crespigny,
laughing; “ not so much your being arrested,
for that might happen to any of us, any day,
but your having L.200 in the house, Dunbar!
Excuso me there! I have as much credulity as
most people, but you should keep to probabi-
lities!”

“Tf one could pay people off with golden
opinions,” observed Sir Patrick conceitedly,
“T flatter myself in that case, that all my cre-
ditors might be more than satisfied.”

“ When are those fellows to have their next

 

meeting?”

“T wish we knew, that I might give them
a harangue on agricultural distress!” replied
Sir Patrick, carelessly plunging his whole hand
into his luxuriant hair. “It gives me no seru-

ple to disappoint the shop-keeping world!
None whatever! These rascals have not the
slightest hesitation in making punctual cus-
tomers pay their bills twice, therefore it is
quite fair that others should not pay at all.
T could point out a dozen of my trades-people
who, knowing they risk only a sheet of paper
by re-sending their bills a year after they are
paid, make a practice of doing so. If the ill-
used customer produces a receipt, why then!
an angry bow and a sulky apology are all the
satisfaction to be got; but if the receipt, by
good chance, be lost, then he becomes per-
fectly cheatable, and no remedy can be had
but to pay over again! I have scen the thing
happen fifty times, long ago, when I really did
sometimes pay my debts, and of course never
took the trouble to keep any receipts.”

“On such occasions,” said Captain De Cres-
pigny, “the offending shopkeeper, when proved
in the wrong, should be fined double the
amount of his bill, to be expended for the be-
nefit of meritorious men like you and me,
Dunbar, who cannot pay once. The sight of

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 331

every poor man I meet gives me a moral
lesson to avoid poverty, coute qui coute; but-as
for you, Dunbar, prudence and economy are
not certainly: to:be enumerated in the cata-
logue of your many virtues! As sure as your
name is Patriek, if L.1000 dropped into your
pocket now, it would be squandered with the
liberality of a prince before you walked to the
next street.”

“ Most uncommonly true, De Crespigny!”
replied Sir Patrick, ringing to order a fresh
bottle of claret. :‘‘ But in these days of bank-
ruptcies, revolutions, robberies, sudden deaths,
and murders, the only way to make sure of
enjoying my own is, to spend it immediately. .
In that case there can be no mistake! I long
ago discovered that it is impossible to be both
merry and wise ; therefore give me joy at any
price. Happiness is to be bought, like every-
thing else, if people have only the heart to pay
for. it. In my opinion a long face and a short
purse are the two great evils of existence, both
to be avoided at the risk of one’s life.”

“ Perfectly unanswerable, Dunbar! Money

332 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

is the patent sauce for giving a relish to every-
thing! It throws dust in the eyes of all the
world, till they can observe none of our faults,
and yet see all our perfections magnified and
enlarged, as wo see them ourselves. Misers
make money the end of life, but we make it
only the means of enjoying existence; a sure
ticket to pleasure of every kind and of every
degree!”

“One of these years, De Crespigny, your
grave will be dug with a golden spade! You
are growing mercenary! But every man living
is, in one way or other, deranged about money;
—those who have none, spending, like myself,
to a frantic excess, and those who have much,
hoarding as if their very lives depended on
amassing another shilling.”

“T wish, Dunbar, you would write a trea-
tise on the art of living well, after we have
been obliged to calculate that difficult sum in
arithmetic, ‘ take nothing from nothing, and
nothing remains !’”

“Why, really, as a shillingless spendthrift,
Tcould say enough to make all of you misers

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 333

during life; but for my own part, as long as
T possess a guinea, the first man who wants it
may get the half. Hoarding is the only en-
joyment which increases, I am told, with in-
creasing years; but it is the only enjoyment
of life I never intend to taste. I mean always
to live rich, that I am determined on ; and if
I die rich, I shall out-hospital every fool who
ever left a will, by endowing a ‘ Dunbar Dis-
pensary for superannuated bon-vivants!’”

~ “ How well the world would get on if every-
body were of your way of thinking !”

“ Thinking! my dear fellow, I never think!
What do you take me for?”

“ For a strange being certainly, and for my
own particular friend. Besides, as the poct
beautifully expresses it in speaking of such
friendship as ours :— :

« We have lived and laughed together,
‘Through many changing years ;
We have smiled each other’s smiles,
And—and paid each other’s bills.”

“ Thank you, De Crespigny! I shall send a

long ago, when my first bright guinea glitter-
ed in our hands, while he detained us to enu-
merate all the various uses it might and ought
to be put to. I never forgot his oration;
that is to say, I have thought of other things
certainly during the intervening ten years;
but it has often occurred to me, that if I had,
as he proposed, hoarded my treasure till ano-
ther came, I should have been a miser for life:
I did, however, squander it then, with the
spirit of a gentleman; and ever since, when-
ever any one lectures on economy, I put cot-
ton in my ears. Wigton, the wine stands

“ Capital claret this, Dunbar! My uncle
Doncaster would not have quarrelled with

as this! Claret is certainly the poetry of wine,

pouring down my throat all day and every
day! Your own importation, I suppose! It

“Tt has been, at any rate, placed to my

dious now, and owe it to myself to have the
best.”

“T can’t tell what you may owe to yourself,”
said Captain De Orespigny, laughingly turning
his dark keen eyes on Sir Patrick ; “but you
certainly owe a great deal to other people.”

“ Very true; and I owe you a grudge for
saying so. JI never-can forgive myself for not

next morning! We all know what your coun-
tenance is worth !”

“ Hear! hear! and a laugh! as they say
in the House of Commons!” exclaimed Lord
Wigton. “ Well done, Sir Patrick the
Great ”

“The great what? Your speech is a frag-
ment!” said Sir Patrick, in his liveliest ac-

 

cents; “ besides which, it was an interruption
to mine, Wigton; and I intended to have
said something particularly amusing, if you

had not broken the thread prematurely. It
is lost to you for ever now! I am dumb as a
flounder; and you may pity all the present
company, as they have really missed a very
good thing.”

“We shall place it to your credit accord-
ingly, Dunbar,” said Captain De Crespigny,
laughing. “It was rather annoying to have
perhaps the only good thing you ever could
have said in your life, nipped in the bud. I
hate sometimes to see a joke of mine standing
with its back to the wall, and struggling in
vain for existence.”

“ Dunbar has talked himself into such a fit
of parsimony,” said Lord Wigton, laughing,
“ that he is even economizing his words.”

“« Nimporte!” replied Sir Patrick, gaily
circulating the bottles. “ You are all mista-
ken, and you particularly, Wigton. I can
economize my way up the hill of life as well
as any one of you, and shall yet live upon an
income of nothing per annum, My plan is,

to become actually quite a pauper in my style
of life; and if all things else. should fail, I
can, as a last resource, turn patriot, and sub-
sist upon liberalism and mob-popularity !”

“That sounds vastly prudent and proper,
Dunbar ; but all I say is, whatever desperate
extremes you arrive at in the way of retrench-
ment, give me the income you spend rather
than the income you have!” replied Captain
De Crespigny. “I took a fit of arithmetic
one day, and discovered, upon accurate cal-
culation, that scattering L.20,000 a-year on
an income of ten, gradually drains off the
whole !”

“ You are a perfect Babbage, my good
fellow! but you know I have expectations
from three uncles in Australia, and one in the
West Indies !”

“Uncles! except the brave old Admiral,
you scaweecly possess.a relation besides myself
in the world; but as long as Sir Arthur lives,
you have something to be proud of. The only
thing I envy you on earth, is for being his

nephew. I reverence him. I never pass him,
rain, hail, or sunshine, without taking off my
hat. He is quite a jewel of a man.”

“ You shall have him very cheap!” replied
Sir Patrick, assuming a careless tone, to con-
ceal a great deal of irritation. “ What will
you bid? I wish he-were ‘ going! going! and
gone!’ I never knew such an old bore as he
is, always interfering about my sisters, and
fussing about my debts. The world ought to
be entirely peopled with uncles, aunts, and
grandmothers, for they all know so much bet-
ter how to act than anybody else.”

“Tt is setting a very bad. example for old
people to live very long. My uncle Doncaster
took a twenty years’ lease of his house in Bel-
grave Square lately, and told me afterwards,
he thought of having the term ‘ extended’ to
the period of his natural life! I am sure his
life is perfectly supernatural already! What
would the old fellow have!”

“Those superannuated people who outlive
themselves have nothing else to do but to sit
in their arm chairs and find fault! The world

is good enough if they would only think so;
but all their world-before-the-flood ideas are
picked up in a different state of existence from
ours. Every thing changes in half a cen-
tury—customs, dress, modes of thinking, no-
tions of honour, ideas of pleasure, habits of
society—all are turned upside down ; so there
can be no use in your uncle or mine prosing
about the past and the future. There is
neither past nor future in my plans of exist-
ence now.”

“ Why, really, if men would neither look
backwards nor forwards, there is scarcely a
moment of any man’s life which is not very
tolerably agreeable. The rule that carries
me joyously forward through life, is to make
the best of everything. We borrow all our
annoyances from anticipation of the future,
which often turns out perfectly groundless, or
from regret for the past. We cannot alter
the stream of events; therefore I am for
floating along the tide with my arms folded,
and looking neither to the right hand nor to
the left.”

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 341

“ Quite right; and take my word for it,
that in this little trumpery world of ours,
ruined men enjoy the best of it. We have
nothing to lose—our estates are managed for
us—we care not the toss of a farthing about
politics—we have no fear of a reverse—we
are always the most liberal of what we have—
and in short, it is true enough, that the ‘ mé-
nage sans souci is the ménage sans siw sous — ”

“ T have generally got through all the diffi-
culties of life hitherto with a hop-skip-and-a-

yet be obliged to welcome gold from whatever
pocket it comes, but I am not very impatient
to see Miss Howard at the head of my table !”

“ My dear fellow ! you would be sitting at
the bottom of her table, if Miss Howard
Smytheson accepted you! It is unlucky that
a fairy-like fortune, and a fairy-like person
are so scldom united in one individual.”

“T have no objection to marry for money
as soon as they are! Love among the roses

gold in a beautiful enough casket, then ‘ les

Ove of the greatest pleasures in life is derived
from the unexpectedness of events, without
which existence would lose much of its in-
terest, and finding herself thus emancipated
from school, settled at home, and relieved
from her worst fears respecting Sir Patrick,
Marion no sooner escaped from her unex-
pected glimpse of the jovial party in the
dining-room, than, lightly carolling some
snatches of a popular song, she flew up stairs
the happiest of the happy, to find the scene of
Agnes’ toilette, whom she discovered at last

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 345

all joy and flutter at the prospect of a ball at,
Lady Towercliffe’'s in the palace.

The softening effect of happiness on stern
and rugged natures has been often remarked,
but selfishness never slumbers, and the recep-
tion Agnes bestowed on Marion partook more
of astonishment than of pleasure, and was
mingled much more with censure than with
approbation. Still, after expressing more won-
der than the occasion called for, what could
possibly have brought her home, and the most
unbounded censure of- Mrs Penfold for her
“ unjustifiable conduct” in sending her, Agnes,
having no one better, or rather no one else
to talk to, though not violently delighted at
the unexpected meeting, gave some frag-
ments of her attention to Marion, whose
deep tender eyes were sparkling with affec-
tionate pleasure on again seeing her sister,
while her countenance, from recent agita-
tion, looked like an April face of smiles and
tears.

“ What a storm in a tea-cup you have had
at Mrs Penfold’s! tiresome old cat! [am

346 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

glad it teased her! Dixon! pin that wreath
more to the right;—not quite so far ! there !—
oh! how perfect!” said Agnes, gazing with
exultation at her own extraordinary beauty.
“Pat must find out some other school for you,
Marion! It would never do to stay idling
here! Dixon! never shew me that dress
again! Wear it yourself or burn it, but blue
always looks vulgar! I have lucky and un-
lucky gowns! Some in which I meet with all
the friends I wish to meet, and dance with all
the partners I prefer, but that dress is a
happy riddance. I remember once being
obliged, when wearing it, to dance three times
and go to supper with stupid tiresome Lord
Wigton! Dixon! fetch my bouquet! not
that withered old thing, but. the one Captain
De Crespigny brought me to-night. Fetch it
from the drawing-room.”

“So that horrid Dixon is still with you!”
whispered Marion, as soon as the abigail’s
last frill disappeared. “I very seldom dis-
like anybody, Agnes, but she is very odd.
‘There is a strange gleam about her eyes,

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 347

which look so sharp and penetrating, they
have prongs that pierce when they are turned
on me.” 4

“Yes!” said Agnes, laughing, “ she does
sometimes look. through me. tillel feel myself
nailed to the wall.

“ Moreover, she has such:a flattering, fawn-
ing, cunning manner, that I wonder you can
tolerate her for an hour,” continued Marion.
“ We know: so little of her, too, that she is
like a person fallen from the clouds!”

“Oh! there you are wrong, for Lady
Towercliffe: says' she is: ‘a perfect treasure
Consider, too, what low’terms sho accepts,
merely from:her desire to serve me! I never
saw a creature so preternaturally anxious to
be taken, and now, after two years’ practice,
she really is excellent. Do you remember at
the time I engaged Dixon, what a perfect ro-
mance her history was'! Pat did not believe a
word of it; but todo her justice, she made it
very entertaining. I hope, at least, the greater
part was founded on fact !”

“ Why does she wear widow’s weeds,—she

348 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

did not mention at first having ever been
married !”

“No more she did! how strangely beauti-
ful she looks in them,—like the abbess of a
convent! Her husband, if she ever had one,
which I doubt, is said to have died abroad,
and her only wish is never to see strangers.
Pat insists she has had some affaire du cur,
but I tell him it must positively have been
with old Sir Arthur, for she started so visibly
one day long ago, and became redder than
red, when I said he was coming to dinner.”

Seeing Agnes in so unusually gracious and
communicative a mood, Marion ventured now
to inquire into the state of her brother's
affairs, saying, she supposed he must inevita-
bly sell hgs estate, go abroad, or retrench, as
the expedient of planting halfpence, to grow
into guineas, had not yet been brought to
perfection, even by Sir Patrick, though it had
so long been a subject of wonder how he con-
trived to get on.

“This has been a horrid business!” exclaim-
ed Agnes peevishly ; “ as for Pat himself, he

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 349

will do very well! Trust him for taking care
of that. He has always money enough and
to spare for his own amusement, though
sometimes he would hardly even pay the pos-
tage of a letter to save my life. Only think
of his bringing me here, out of everybody's
way, during the most beautiful years of my
existence! Our friends will scarcely imagine
that I think it worth chair hire to travel from
this burying-place to the inhabited world!
‘What can one do. We shall give. some
quadrille parties ourselves, but scarcely a liv-
ing soul is within reach except the Tower-
cliffes, and those odious Granvilles !”

“ The Granvilles !” exclaimed Marion, in a
blaze of joy and astonishment ; “ dear Clara!
is she here.”

“ Yes; but she cuts this house entirely,
and we are hardly on speaking terms, there-
fore let me beg you not to attempt any violent
missyish, boarding-school friendships in that
quarter. I cannot enter into particulars, but
rest assured that the less you see of Clara the
better for me,—and the better, too, for Pat-

350 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

rick. Never, for your life, mention her name
before him.”

“ Why?” asked Marion with a look of be-
wildered disappointment. “ Agnes, I cannot
give up Clara Granville !”

“ Perhaps, then, she may give you up!
She abhors the whole family now! If I must
not veto her without rendering a reason, let
me tell you that there is a very awkward
pecuniary quarrel] between Mr Granville, Pat,
and Mr De Crespigny. It is merely one of
their madcap tricks, but extremely annoying.
You have often heard Sir Arthur tell of
three Yorkshire baronets, who signed a mu-
tual contract sixty years ago, that the first
of them who married should forfeit £10,000
to both the others.”

“ Yes; and not one of them ever ventured
to dispose of himself at so great a sacrifice.”

“Well! some years afterwards, the sub-
ject was discussed one day in public conclave,
at the Harrowgate ordinary, and what should
the late Mr Granville do, in company with
Major De Orespigny and our father, but, like

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 351

a set of madmen, as’ they must have been at
the moment, drew up, for a frolic, precisely
such an agreement for themselves, which
they signed’and sealed, making some of the
150 strangers present act as witnesses. The
whole affair had been long forgotten, when
Mr Granville married some fright of ai girl,
all nose and freckles, merely because of her
being amiable, or some such whim. She lived
long enough to make saints of the whole
family, and) died after her son and daughter
were only a few years old.”

“Then how is your quarrel with Clara
tacked on to this affair, Agnes? I cannot
quite trace the connexion.”

“ Why! Pat has: been very angry at Mr
Granville lately about’ some unexplainable
affront ; so, having accidentally found the old
Harrowgate document, and being very hard
up for money; he and Captain De Crespigny
are threatening to levy the fine of £10,000
due to each of them, and poor Mr Granville
is, as you may suppose, rather indignant,
having been all his life stringing halfpence to-

gether, to pay off his father’s debts, though
no one could legally oblige him. As Pat
says, ‘more fool he! You know our bro-
ther’s favourite expression of contempt is, to
describe any one as ‘the sort of man who
would lock up his money.’”

“ What a shocking affair!” exclaimed
Marion, colouring with shame and indigna-
tion. “ As uncle Arthur says, Patrick would
do any thing for money short of a highway
robbery! Surely, Agnes, he cannot be in
earnest.”

“ Pshaw! never mind being amiable now,”
replied Agnes impatiently ; “ we need not act
to empty benches! I am already aware that
you, Marion, are on the exact pattern of what
Mrs Hannah More would bespeak to order
for a sister or daughter; but with all you
learn at school, pray learn to keep that
goodyism out of sight, for L can fancy no-
thing more intolerable than a young lady
turned out on the model of those horrid sen-
tentious books, filled with advice to young
ladies. Mrs Ellis writes to the ‘ Women of

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 353

England,’ but she luckily leaves the “Women
of Scotland’ to their own devices, without
troubling us to be exorbitantly amiable.”

<I shall be in no hurry to see Clara now !”
continued Marion, dejectedly. “I suppose
Patrick will be cut by all gentlemen for such
unjustifiable conduct.”

“Oh dear, no! Nobody is ever cut for
anything now as long as he has money! I
can scarcely tell the thing upon earth, except
cheating at cards, that a man of £10,000 a-
year may not do, and yet. be as well received
as ever,—and ladies ditto! Any woman who
can afford a court plume, and many even who
cannot afford one, may fit on her ostrich
feathers, and go to court with as proud a step
and as lofty a carriage, as either you or I.
Your unele, Sir Arthur, complains that there
is no such thing as ‘ moral indignation’ in
the world now, and so much the better.
What good would it do to anybody? If a
gentleman once gets into a fashionable club,
he is made for life, and may ever afterwards
defy the world to look askance at him.”

B54 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

“Then nobody takes any notice of Pat-
rick’s affairs?” asked Marion doubtfully.

“No; except uncle Arthur, who makes
himself quite absurd about them ; refuses to
dine here; turns his back on Patrick at the
club, in a most un-uncle-like manner; and per-
forms all sorts of antics to testify his annoy-
ance; but we are both rather glad he no
longer comes prosing to this house, and that
we need never enter his. The Admiral is a
fitter companion for these old pictures round
the wall than for us. Do not look at me
with that hair-standing-on-end expression !
I can’t help what Patrick does, and you will
soon get accustomed to such things.”

“Oh no, never! I hope never! but Pat-
rick cannot surely push that claim in earnest
against the Granvilles. He will refund the
money, will he not, Agnes!”

“ Perhaps, when all his other creditors are
paid off. Now spare the whites of your eyes,
and do not look at me as if I had five heads,
but pray attend to my injunction, and avoid

than to go. Fancy me, Agnes Dunbar, at a
good party !”

“T hope you might not be so very much
out of place, Agnes!” replied Marion, with
an arch and pretty smile. “ Whenever I give
“good parties’ you shall be the very first
person invited !”

“Then take my apology now,—previously
engaged! Indeed, I may perhaps consider
myself an engaged person in every sense,
Marion! Captain De Crespigny has already
almost proposed several times, and makes no
seeret of his attachment. Oh, never mind
Dixon! She knows who sent me this bou-
quet and all about it. Captain De Crespigny
tells me he has planted all my favourite
flowers at Kilmarnock Abbey, and often says
what a resource they will hereafter become to
me! Here are all the letters of my name
grouped together, Anemone, Geranium, Nar-
cissus, Everlasting, and Sweet William.”

“« Very ingenious,” observed Marion, smil-

ing.

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 357

“T promised not to mention whose device
it was; therefore, Marion, as I am exceeding-
ly particular about keeping my word, if any
one guesses where I got this, remember to
recollect that I did not tell! But, Dixon,
what is the meaning of this! the geranium is
broken and these flowers are so withered,
they have not surely been in water.”

‘When Marion accidentally looked at Dixon,
she was startled to perceive that a mortal
paleness had overspread her features, which
bore a strange bewildered expression, while
her hand, in which she held the flowers, trem-
bled visibly, but she said nothing, and Agnes,
in the triumphant gayety of her spirits, rat-
tled heedlessly on.

“One of the rooms at Beaujolie castle,
which Captain De Crespigny already calls
‘my boudoir, opens into a conservatory filled
with rare exotics, but he says I shall be the
brightest flower of the whole, though never

very droll he is, paying compliments often

He said this morning, when Patrick com-
plained of: the room being hot, that he wished
I would fan it with my eyelashes, and asked
for one of them to wear as a feather in his
Highland bonnet! Yesterday, when I show-
ed Captain Do Crespigny this new pearl
hoop, he said I spoiled the symmetry of my
hand with rings, as there was not a jewel in
the world fit for me to wear, and only one
ring that ought ever to be placed here! You
should have seen his sentimental look on the
oceasion, which might have done for twenty
proposals !”

“ One would have been enough,” said Ma-
rion, smiling.

“ What he said was quite sufficiently expli-
cit, and I only wish he would appear a little
more diffident, as his look was most provok-
ingly self-satisfied, when he added, ‘ how for-
tunate will be the happy man who places a
ring on that finger!" When speaking of the
Admiral, too, he always now calls him ‘ uncle
Arthur! and yesterday, at taking leave, he
said in his half jocular, half serious tone, ‘ I

‘
MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 359

shall live upon the Bridge of Sighs till we
meet again !’”

“ Then, pray let him stay there, till he is a
little less confident,” replied Marion, laugh-
ing. “ You should teach diffidence in three
lessons, Agnes; he has no right to seem sure
of success, till he has obtained your consent
point blank. You have many admirers to
choose among !”

“ Squadrons of admirers, but not so many
lovers as you think, Marion! The race of
marrying men is becoming extinct in the
world, so I must not be severely discouraging
to poor diffident Captain De Crespigny,.who
has been setting his mustachios at me so long.
Your notions about keeping people in sus-
pense, are quite of the old school, when
ladies used all to be upon stilts, but ‘ nous
awons. changé tout cela”

“Tam sorry for it! We should all have
been born when Sir Arthur was, and I wish
everybody were like him.”

you, Marion, but I am not particular, and

feel quite satisfied to be a contemporary of
Captain De Crespigny. Ifyou could but have
heard him this morning when he sang the
“ Pirate’s Serenade,’ said Agnes, warbling the
words to herself,

© This night, or never, my bride thou shalt be.”

While Agnes continued singing sotto voce
for some minutes, her whole heart and
thoughts occupied with agreeable retrospec-
tions, the eye of Marion again accidentally
wandered towards Dixon, and she was start-
led out of a reverie, into something almost
approaching alarm, by observing her attitude
and expression. With features as pale and
rigid as those of a corpse, she gazed at Agnes,
and there was an intensity in her look, per-
fectly unaccountable, while a dazzling and ter-
rible light glittered in her eyes. Marion with
difficulty suppressed an exclamation of aston-
ishment, when she perceived the extraordi-
nary change in Dixon’s countenance, but with
a private resolution to watch more narrowly
than before, what such evident agitation could

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 361

mean, she determined as yet to make no re-
mark, but allowed Agnes to rattle on undis-
turbed, while her own thoughts were filled
with perplexity and surprise.

“ Yesterday, Marion, Captain De Crespig-
ny actually made me read over with him that
proposal scene in the new novel, ‘ Matrimonial
Felicity” I nearly died of confusion when he
doubled down the page, saying, he hoped this
was not the last time we should study it toge-
ther. The story has but one fault, that the
hero makes rather a low marriage, and of that
Captain De Crespigny expressed an utter ab-
horrenee! I remember ages ago, his making
me laugh so excessively with a description of
some school-boy attachment he had in York-
shire! Such a burlesque upon love! It was
exquisite! The silver thimbles and wall-flowers
he presented to a fair damsel in prunella shoes,
and no gloves, while his gages d’amour were ac-
companied with verses borrowed from the Irish
Melodies, and passed off as his own. I forgot
always to ask what became of the poor de-
luded girl at Iast,—probably married before

this time to some fat farmer or thriving shop-
keeper, but for my own part, the misery of an
unrequited attachment is what I never can
know! Captain De Crespigny really is the only
person one could possibly have fancied.”

A loud and startling crash at this moment
interrupted Agnes’ delightful reminiscences.
Marion instinctively sprang from her seat with
alarm, and looked hastily round, when she
perceived that Dixon had tripped over and
thrown down a table covered with china or-
naments, on which Miss Dunbar had frequent-
ly squandered half her income, even at times
when she could scarcely afford a dress. The
etiquette being now established that all young
ladies, of whatever means, shall cultivate a
passion for china and hot-house plants, Agnes
had made a collection of second-rate vases,
and third-rate tea-cups, interspersed with
stunted hyacinths and drooping camellias, at
so great an expense that Sir Patrick often re-
commended her to take a wing of the bazaar
and sell off all her trumpery again. The whole
assortment, now lay in fragments on the floor,

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 363

while Agnes delivered herself up to agonies of
lamentation, scolding, and wondering, over the
ruin of her hoarded treasures, while she point-
ed out with consternation, how nearly the
table had fallen with its edge upon her own
foot, which might have lamed her for life.
The “ fall of china” is a proverbial trial of
temper, and that of Agnes did not prove on
this occasion invulnerable, while the epithets,
“awkward wretch!” and “stupid idiot !” were
audibly lavished on the offending abigail.
Marion appeared exclusively occupied in
gathering up the scattered fragments of china,
and arranging them together, but her eye was
secretly observing Dixon, the strange wild ex-
pression of whose features filled her with in-
definite apprehension. In her countenance
there gleamed, certainly, for an instant, a dark
smile of malignant satisfaction. Marion felt
sure that it was so! Could the poor creature’s
mind be shipwrecked? .Was she insane!—
Her look had become fierce and haggard, her
forehead of a deadly paleness, and when she
caught the eye of Marion earnestly fixed upon

364 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

her, she started up, with a frown of angry
defiance, and hurried out of the room.

“This is a most calamitous catastrophe!”
exclaimed Agnes, disconsolately, “ How could
Dixon be so intolerably stupid!”

“ Are you quite ‘certain it proceeded from
stupidity? The accident is altogether very
strange,” observed Marion, going close up to
her sister, and relating all she had observed
during that evening in the very lowest whisper,
for Marion felt a nervous consciousness that:
Dixon was not far off, and might attempt to
overhear them. A stealthy step was heard on
the stair after she concluded, but Marion,
thoroughly engrossed with the subject, reiter-
ated once more her convietion that there had
been something more than common in the
manner of Dixon, whom she advised Agnes to
watch very carefully, if she did not part with
her soon.

“You were always prejudiced against Dixon,
poor stupid fool that she is, Marion. I wish
T had sent her adrift before she broke all the
china, but it is very unlike you to be so severe!

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 365

How can you fancy the creature did it on pur-
pose? That is too bad, when yow might have
seen how ghastly pale she became!”

“T did see, Agnes! and that makes mo
wonder only the more! No one ever looked
like that, surely, for breaking a few china
gewgaws!”

“ Marion! speak respectfully of my trea-
sures! But you are in a most censorious mood
this evening! very different from common,
when you are generally a knight-errant in all
our conversations, defending everybody! But
nothing pleases you to-night! My admirer
first, then my maid, my china, and even Pat-
rick, who certainly behaved exceedingly ill
to-day, in not asking me to preside at his par-
ty. The pretext was, that we had no cha-
peron, but I had the greatest mind, in a fit of
offended dignity, to leave his house!”

“ Your dignity would have been rather put
out of countenance, by having to borrow my
carriage if you did go!” said Sir Patrick, who
had laughingly entered the room unobserved.
“Lady Towercliffe may perhaps receive you

366 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

in time for her six o'clock breakfast to-morrow
morning, Agnes, but unless you make more
haste, the supper and dancing will be quite
out of the question. Past twelve o'clock, and
a rainy night!”

Sir Patrick was a good-natured, selfish
man, willing that everybody should be happy,
provided it put him to no personal inconveni-
ence, and when Marion took this opportunity
to explain the circumstances of her very unex-
pected return, he merely bestowed a contemp-
tuous whistle on the description of Mrs Pen-
fold’s wrath, laughed at Marion’s evident anx-
iety about his embarrassments, and then de-
sired her to set about being happy at home
the best way she could, as he thought she
might make the rest of her life a holiday now;
“ And,” added he, in his usual gay rallying
tone, “ forget for ever, all your grievances at
Mrs Penfold’s, or rather, Mrs Tenfold’s, as
she ought to be called, on account of the

CHAPTER XIII.

Lively he seem’d, and spoke of all he knew,
‘The friendly many, and the favourite few.—Crasne.

Sm Parnick, like most men who are gifted
with more head than heart, disbelieved in all
such generous emotions and exalted affections
as he had not himself experienced. With a
lively defiance of received opinions, his viva-
city was unchecked by the fear of giving pain
or of causing offence, being perfectly reckless
on that score, provided only he could enliven
the dull routine of ordinary society. Marion’s
mingled expression of shyness and animation,
her light laughter and ardent feelings, were

368 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

refreshing to a mind so hackneyed as his, and
though he often checked her sensitive spirit
in its full flow of affectionate confidence, by
a retort courteous, or rather discourteous, he
was nevertheless vain of the admiration she
invariably excited, and read, in the eyes of
others, the value he ought to place on her
beauty and talents.

Agnes’ whole mind was so frothed over
with folly, and encrusted with selfishness, that
unless the wheel of fortune touched upon her
personal comforts, she was as impervious to all
external impressions as a tortoise beneath the
shell, and it was a useless waste of generous
sentiments and kind emotions, whenever the
heart of Marion was laid open to her. Agnes,
who had long since adopted a company man-
ner, and even a company voice, persuaded her-
self that Marion also, had very cleverly “ got
up” a character on some imaginary model of
excellence, which she acted over to the very
life. It seemed to her a naked certainty that
the refinement and delicacy natural to Ma-

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 369

rion’s mind, were in reality artificial; and
though the radiance of her intellect, and the
sensibility of her eye,. were but in harmony
with her actions, all testifying disinterested
self-denial and invariable affection, still Agnes
convinced herself that Marion lived “ for
effect.”

If Marion ever acted a part at all, it was
only in concealing from those who might have
ridiculed her, the unfathomable depth of her
feelings, since she might as well have asked
for sympathy from an ice-berg as from Agnes.
Knowing that every evidence of sensibility
would be received with scepticism, she silently
and hopefully waited till some scope might be
afforded her for testifying that all which she
might haye wished to profess, was nothing to
what she would do or suffer for those she
loved ; and if ever Marion repined at any one
circumstance in her lot, it was, that she might
perhaps pass through life unknown to those
she loved the best, because she dared not ex-
press, even by a few insignificant words, that
affectionate attachment to Agnes and Sir

370 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

Patrick, which she would have thought any
sacrifice a pleasure, to evince in its full and
heartfelt measure.

One privilege of friendship Marion enjoyed
in unbounded measure with both her brother
and sister. She became the usual ‘depositary
of their many grievances and disappointments.
Marion had the art,—or rather the instinct,
for to her all art was unknown,—of listening
in perfection. If Agnes received a dress from
her London milliner which did not fit, or if Sir
Patrick did not obtain an invitation to some
jovial party which he had expected to enliven,
Marion became of immediate importance.
The annoyance he felt on such occasions could
scarcely be exceeded—the death of his nearest
relation, or of al] his relations together, would
-have been nothing to it; but Marion could
always administer some gentle anodyne to the
irritated sufferer, and displayed a wonderful
ingenuity in turning up the best side of every-
thing, for the advantage and comfort of others.
Nothing melted Marion’s heart so entirely as
to see Sir Patrick for a moment depressed, as

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 371

the very pride and haughtiness of his spirit ren-
dered it, in her estimation, the more affecting
when he seemed at all subdued, and on the
evening of Lady Towereliffe’s ball, she could
not but fancy, before he set off with Agnes,
that there was a forced vivacity in his spirits
which she had never perceived before, and
that the tone of his voice had a melancholy
modulation when he bid her good night, ac-
companied by an unusual degree of kindness,
always the very worst indication of Sir Pa-
trick’s spirits, the consciousness of which, and
a thousand conjectures respecting its cause
and extent, dismissed her to bed with an anx-
ious mind, and a prayer, even more fervent
than usual, for his happiness.

In one house, Marion was understood and
loved as she wished to be, and all her young
enthusiasm found its best refuge and welcome
in the aged heart of Sir Arthur, who felt re-
freshed and cheered by the companionship of
thoughts and feelings as fresh and natural
as the flowers in spring, while they reminded
him of the time when his own had been as

372 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

buoyant and untrodden, as hopeful and gay,
as full of kind intentions and generous
wishes.

The morning after Marion’s arrival at St
John’s Lodge, she arose by the peep of day,
intent on surprising her uncle with a visit
during his carly breakfast, and gayly antici-
pating the look of joyful surprise and perplex-
ity with which she would be welcomed, while
she rehearsed in her own happy mind, how
best to increase Sir Arthur's astonishment.
The day was indeed one of matchless beauty,
the sunshine perfectly superb, and all around
resplendent with light, gayety, and happiness,
the white clouds skimming along like swans on
the blue sky, the air perfumed with blossoms,
every leaf spangled with dew, the painted
butterflies, like winged flowers, hovering over
the meadows, and the country people exhibiting
looks full of mirth, hilarity, and good-humour,
as they hastened past to their tasks of daily
toil, enjoying those common gifts of a bounti-
ful Providence, the light breeze, the balmy sun-
shine, the music of birds, the perfume of

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 373

flowers, and the joy of natural unfevered
spirits.
« And now, while bloom and breeze their charms unite,
‘And all is glowing with a rich delight,

God ! who can tread upon the breathing ground,
Nor feel Thee present, where Thy smiles abound ?”

The whole air seemed full of incense and
poetry when the light-footed Marion, with a
bounding and clastic step, set forth on her
solitary walk towards Portobello, joyous as a
bird in spring, pleased with the whole world,
and admiring everything with a lightness of
heart that cast its sunshine on all she saw.
Marion delighted in a wild sense of liberty
now, when she contrasted it with her long
years of endurance at Mrs Penfold’s; and
equipped in exactly such a pink gingham
dress as Agnes had censured on Clara Gran-
ville, with the free air, like liquid sunshine,
playing about her glowing cheek, and her
light ringlets fluttering in the breeze, the ex-
citement of her spirits became such that she
could have run with pleasure across the daisied
meadows, and, “ glad as the wild bee on his

374 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

glossy wing,” longed to reach the craggy
heights of Arthur Seat, or to linger beneath
the old thorns already fragrant with blossom,
and steeped in dew.

Marion had picked some flowers as fresh
and blooming as herself, while she hurried
through the more inhabited parts of the sanc-
tuary, but when passing beneath the palace
windows, her steps were arrested for a mo-
ment by hearing the sounds of mirth and
music. “Can it be!” thought she, in asto-
nishment, “ Lady Towereliffe’s ball is yet at
its zenith !”

Pitying the dancers much more than she
envied them, Marion looked at the scene of
glorious beauty around her, and was hurrying
forward, humming a light barcarolle in con-
cert with the thousand birds in full chorus on
every side, when suddenly a loud shout caus-
ed her to start and turn round. Marion now
perceived with astonishment that a window
of Lady Towercliffe’s apartments had been
hastily opened, and Sir Patrick stood on the
balcony waving his handkerchief impetuously

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 375

for her to stop, and a moment afterwards she
saw him eagerly running after her across the
fields without his hat.

“ Marion! you lucky girl! stop there!”
exclaimed he with breathless animation.
“We are all at breakfast, and require one
young lady more to make up a last quadrille,
so come along; you are my prisoner! What
makes you look so aghast! Who ever heard
of a girl not liking her first ball !”

“ Patrick, you are certainly mad!” said
Marion, unable to help laughing at the almost
delirious eagerness of his manner. “ Pray
consider! Iam not in a ball dress! Iam
not invited! I shall look like a house-
maid! ”

 

“Nonsense! I wish everybody looked
half as well! All these reasons, and fifty
more, go for nothing. I have set my heart
upon it, and you shall not stand in your own
light, like the man in the moon. No, Marion!
you are to be published immediately under
my auspices. You have often expressed a
willingness to die for me any day, but that is

376 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

not necessary just at present. All I ask is
that you shall dance forme! Now, fling that
bonnet off, shake your little forest of ring-
lets, and come along. You will pass muster
very well without Cinderella’s god-mother to
make a metamorphosis.”

Unable to resist the out-burst of her bro-
ther’s extravagant mirth, yet shrinking and
abashed, almost ready to ery with vexation,
Marion was unwillingly led, or almost drag-
ged by her laughing persecutor into the draw-
ing-room, where, with a look of naéveté, and
an aspect lovely in the first blush and fresh-
ness of girlhood, she gazed in mute astonish-
ment and almost with dismay at this her first
peep into the great world of fashion, wishing
for her own part that she could have adopted
invisibility, and enjoyed the scene as if she
were in a private box at the theatre, for as
yet her feelings were “ trop prés de la peine
pour étre un plaisir.”

A bright sunshine streamed into the room,
while the gas lamps still dimly glared over
the breakfast table, at present surrounded by

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 377

three or four hot, flushed, dusty-looking
young ladies, with exaggerated colours, soiled
dresses, torn gloves, withered bouquets, and
exceedingly disordered ringlets, falling in
dishevelled masses over their naked shoulders.
These ladies, assuming forced spirits, and an
appearance of over-done gayety, kept up a
rattling, flippant dialogue with about twice.or
three times the number of gentlemen, some in
glittering uniforms, padded and stuffed to the
very chin, and others in plain clothes, but all
over-heated, over-excited, and over-fatigued,
while, in spite of parched lips and blood-shot
eyes, they were still endeavouring, with all
their might, to be fascinating.

To Marion’s unaccustomed eye the whole
party seemed like a set of second-rate actors
from the theatre, not calculated, by their
aspect, to elicit very rapturous applauses, and
she privately wondered they were not asham~-
ed to look each other in the face when in so
ridiculous a plight. Even Agnes, her own
beautiful sister, looked very unlike Agnes!
and she felt astonished to find that it might

378 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

actually be possible to spend an hour in her
company and not be admiring her, but in
Marion’s very private opinion, her appearance
was now as if some sign-post painter had
done a resemblance of her sister in the very
coarsest colouring, and in the most over-done
style of dress and expression.

Agnes had a great deal to say, and no diffi-
dence to prevent her saying it all, therefore
she was now plunged into the midst of a very
animated dialogue with Captain De Cres-
pigny, talking with a look of conscious beauty
and conscious success, in the only style she
could talk, nonsense, and making a lavish ex-
penditure of smiles, attitudes, and exclama-
tions, to give herself the appearance of viva-
city. Hor hair was in a most disastrous
state, and her complexion everything but
what it should be, while her dress had so
completely fallen off at the shoulders, that she
might appropriately have sung her favourite
air, “ One struggle more, and I am free.”

The expression of Agnes’ countenance be-
came at once perfectly natural, when she

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 379

turned round, and for the first time observed,
with a start of genuine astonishment, that
Marion was beside her, looking at the mo-
ment like some being of a better world, or
like a graceful water-lily rearing its pure and
beautiful head above the turbid pool.

Marion glanced at her sister in a state of
smiling embarrassment, as if desirous to claim
her protection amidst a scene so new and
strange, and taking possession, with a con-
fiding look, of Agnes’ arm, joy seemed rush-
ing out of her bright animated eyes, and
dimpling in her cheeks, when, under her
sister’s protection, she gazed around with an
expression of timid amusement and curiosity.

“ Marion, what mad freak is this!” ex-
claimed Agnes, with a hot red blush of angry
surprise; “ Patrick, do take her home !”

“ Not till she has been my vis 2 vis in this
quadrille, and then we must all disperse,” re-
plied Sir Patrick, with a boyish mischievous
laugh, while noticing a haughty flash pass
swiftly over the brow of Agnes; “ I had diffi-
culty enough in getting Marion to come at

380 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

all, so she shall not escape me now. De
Crespigny, have you engaged a partner *”

“Tf I had, I would have strangled her!”
replied Captain De Crespigny, with an admir-
ing glance at Marion, who stood with her
downcast eyes shaded with their long deep
fringes, while an arch young smile played
round her mouth, and dimpled her cheek.

“ Will you then take the very great trouble
of dancing with Marion.”

“T shall be too happy,” replied he, throw-
ing a world of expression into his fine animat-
ed eyes. “I shall do so with all my heart !”

“ Marion, your old friend and cousin, Louis
de Crespigny. Did you ever see such an ugly
fellow !”

“ That is the very thing I pique myself
upon! I am like the Skye terriers, admired
chiefly for my surpassing ugliness,” said Cap-
tain De Crespigny laughingly, observing the
smile and the blush with which Marion listen-
ed. “ You think me plain; but I wish you
saw my uncle !”

“ Wear a mask, De Orespigny, if you ever

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 381

become as hideous! But-in respect to looks,
the most unendurable of all living beings is a
handsome vulgar man, like the description I
hear of that creature Howard, Sir Arthur’s
pen-and-ink man. I could forgive his vulga-
rity, if Marion did not tell me that he pre-
sumes to be handsome, which renders him ut-
terly insufferable! I wish somebody would
put him to death !”

“The fellow has never yet shewn himself
to me,” replied Captain De Crespigny, care-
lessly. ‘‘ Now, Miss Dunbar, allow me the
honour of the next quadrille with you; and if
there be a dozen more,” added he, with his
most ineffable smile, “so much the better !
I consider any other gentleman who asks you
to-night as my personal enemy !”

Marion stole a frightened glance at Agnes,
while timidly accepting the offered arm of
Captain De Crespigny; but her sister had
turned away with a look of superb disdain,
and was engaged in lively conversation with
Lord Wigton, a tall stripling, who seemed as
if he were never to be done growing, and who

382 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

copied Captain De Crespigny in everything,
from the pattern of his watch-chain to the
choice of his partners.

Agnes felt invariably more astonished at
any deficiency of attention, than at the most
devoted assiduity, having accustomed herself
to believe that she was always the first object
of interest to every gentleman in the room,
though diffidence or caution might cause them
to exercise their self-denial for a time, by
keeping aloof; and it was with more com-
miseration for Captain De Crespigny’s priva-
tion in losing her, than for her own, that she
accepted the school-boy Peer as a partner,
while secretly amused and flattered by the
ludicrous expression of awe and admiration
with which he usually offered himself. Hay-
ing talked, flirted, and laughed, through one
quadrille and several reels, the clock struck
eight! It was an unspeakable triumph to
Lady Towercliffe, that her ball had thus been
kept up the latest of any during the season ;
and now the whole party prepared for retiring
to their fevered pillows.

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 383

Captain De Crespigny, after uttering, as
usual, in his most ingratiating manner, a mil-
lion of absurd nothings, took a sentimental
leave of Marion, saying, with his very best
smile, and a sigh to correspond, “ I shall al-
ways remember this evening with pleasure—
always! Ten minutes of unmixed happiness
are something in this world to be thankful for
Life has nothing more delightful !”

These words were said in his usual gay,
offhand tone, while Captain De Crespigny
felt perfectly charmed to think what an im-
pression they must be making on the heart of
his young and unsophisticated partner. He
was at the same time astonished himself, to
find on this occasion how much more his heart
was on his lips than it had ever been before.
Marion was the only girl Captain De Cres-
pigny had yet seen whom he did not feel a wish
to trifle with; for during the last half hour,
he had been not only amused, but deeply in-
terested, by discovering in her conversation a
degree of matured reflection, of naiveté, hu-
mour,and good-sense, accompanied bya bright-

384 MODERN FLIRTATIONS.

ness of expression in her deeply-speaking eyes,
much in contrast with what he had ever been
accustomed to before. Nothing is so rare in
manner as to be perfectly natural, without a
soupcon of affectation ; and to this charm was
added another, quite as new and unexpected
to Captain De Crespigny, though by no means
so acceptable, as he became not only asto-
nished, but piqued, at the gay, indifferent
carelessness, with which Marion heard, as
words of course, not more belonging to her,
than if they had been addressed to any one
else, his well-turned compliments and insinu-
ated admiration.

Not to be met half-way was new and asto-
nishing to Captain De Crespigny! It seemed
perfectly unaccountable, little as he knew how
long his character for a ruthless flirt had been
placarded before the eyes of Marion, who no
more credited the sincerity of his professions
now, than if he had been an actor performing
on the stage. She considered that it was his
part for the evening to scatter civilities indis-
criminately around him, while his real feelings

MODERN FLIRTATIONS. 385

were, she believed, privately consecrated to
one, and to one only. Marion’s own heart
was in armour, protected by the belief of Cap-
tain De Crespigny being her affianced brother ;
and therefore she received his adiewx with a
quiet demure look, succeeded by an arch smile,
as the idea crossed her mind how completely
she was in the secret of his attachment, and
how little he seemed to guess that she was.
When Captain De Crespigny observed
Marion’s good-humoured careless manner in
taking leave of him, he began to fancy it just
possible she might still be quite indifferent to
his attentions; but he rather indignantly re-
solved that this should not continue long. It
would be a distinction, he knew, to follow in
the train of a young beauty so admired as he
saw that Marion must be; for a hundred
tongues were already talking around him of
her matchless loveliness, while he alone had
yet enjoyed an opportunity of discovering,
that much as she was to be admired by those
who saw her, she was still more to be loved
by those who knew her; for she seemed to

unite in herself all that he had ever praised in
a thousand others before, though he carried
no plummet in his mind fitted to measure the
depth of hers. Captain De Orespigny had
been accustomed, hitherto, always to feign
more than he felt ; but now, for'the first time,
he found it necessary to conceal, even from
himself, the extent of his feelings; for it
seemed as if the last few hours had rendered
Marion perfectly known, and for ever dear to
him. Slowly strolling homewards, therefore,
he gave vent to his thoughts, by singing, in a
voice like moonlight, soft and clear, the words
of a favourite song :—
“ And fare thee well, my only love!

And fare the
And I will come again my love,

 

well a while

 

‘Though it were ten thousand mile.”
