But O
the O

her O

for O
the O

it O

“ O

some O
one O

at O

Jem B-PERSON
entered O

looking O
more O
awkward O

abashed O

She O
did O
not O

after O
standing O

“ O

, O
by O
way O

went O

from O
his O

what O

her O

beat O

so O
suddenly O

violently O
she O
could O
hardly O

Yet O
one B-CARDINAL

It O

He O

not O

He O
only O

With O
his O
soft O
voice O
, O
and O
pleading O

looks O
, O
he O
uttered O
, O
in O
his O
pretty O
broken O
English B-LANGUAGE
, O
the O
word O

“ O
Hungry O

by O

the O

the O
solitary O
word O

he O
pointed O

his O
mouth O

with O
its O
white O
quivering O
lips O

‘ O
Mary B-PERSON
answered O
him O
impatiently O

“ O
Oh O

hunger O

nothing O

nothing O

” O

And O
she O
rapidly O
passed O
on O
. O
But O
her O
heart O
upbraided O
her O
the O
|
| O
next B-TIME
minute I-TIME
with O
her O
unrelenting O
speech O
, O
and O
she O
hastily O
entered O
|
| O
her O
door O
and O
seized O
the O
scanty O
remnant O
of O
food O
which O
the O
cup- O

board O
contained O
, O
and O
she O
retraced O
her O
steps O
to O
the O
place O
where O
|
| O
the O
little O
hopeless O
stranger O
had O
sunk O
down O
by O
his O
mute O
compa- O

nion O
in O
loneliness O
and O
starvation O
, O
and O
was O
raining O
down O
tears O
as O

he O
spoke O
in O
some O
foreign O
tongue O
, O
with O
low O
cries O
for O
the O
far O

distant O
“ O
Mamma O
mia O
! O
” O

With O
the O
elasticity O
of O
heart O
belonging O
to O
childhood O
he O
sprang O

up O
as O
he O
saw O
the O
food O
the O

brought O
  O
she O
whose O
face O

lovely O

in O
its O
woe O

had O
tempted O
him O

address O
her O
  O

, O
with O
the O

graceful O
courtesy O
of O
his O
country O
, O
he O
looked O
up O
and O
smiled O
while O

he O
kissed O
her O
hand O
, O
and O
then O
poured O
forth O
his O
thanks O
, O
and O

shared O
her O
bounty O
with O
his O
little O
pet O

. O
She O
stood O
an O
|
| O
instant O
, O
diverted O
from O
the O
thought O
of O
her O
own O
grief O
by O
the O
sight O

of O
his O
infantine O
gladness O
  O
and O
then O
bending O
down O
and O
kissing O
|
| O
his O
smooth O
forehead O
, O
she O
left O
him O
, O
and O
sought O
to O
be O
alone O
with O
|
| O
her O
agony O
once O
more O
. O
|

| O
She O
re O

entered O
the O
house O
, O
locked O
the O
door O
, O
and O
tore O
off O
her O
|

bonnet O
, O
as O
if O
greedy O
of O
every O
moment O
which O
took O
her O
from O
the O

| O
full O
indulgence O
of O
painful O
, O
despairing O
thought O
. O

Then O
she O
threw O
herself O
on O
the O
ground O
, O
yes O
, O
on O
the O
hard O
|

flags O
she O
threw O
her O
soft O
limbs O
down O
  O
and O
the O
comb O
fell O
out O
of O
her O

hair O
, O
and O
those O
bright O
tresses O
swept O
the O
dusty O
floor O
, O
while O
she O

pillowed O
and O
hid O
her O
face O
on O
her O
arms O
, O
and O
burst O
forth O
into O
hard O
, O

suffocating O
sobs O
. O

Oh O
, O
earth O

thou O
didst O
seem O

a O
dreary O

thy O

None O

Oh O

Why O
did O

and O
grandeur O
? O
Why O
had O
she O
thought O
it O
a O
fine O
thing O
to O
have O
a O

| O
rich O
lover O
? O
|

She O
— O
she O
had O
deserved O
it O
all O
  O
but O
he O
was O
the O
victim O
, O
— O
he O

the O

She O
could O
not O
conjecture O
, O
she O
could O
not O
even O

pause O
to O
think O
who O
had O
revealed O

or O
how O

discovered O
her O

acquaintance O

Harry B-PERSON

It O
was O

too O
clear O
, O
some O

way O
or O
another O
, O
he O
had O
learnt O
all O
  O
and O
what O
would O
he O
think O

ofher O
? O
No O
hope O
of O
his O
love O
, O
— O
oh O
, O
that O
she O
would O
give O
up O
, O
and O
|

be O
content O
  O
it O
was O
his O
life O

his O
precious O
life O
, O
that O
was O
threatened O
? O
|
| O
‘ O
Then O
she O
tried O
to O
recall O
the O
particulars O
, O
which O
, O
when O
Mrs. O
Wil- O

| O
son O
had O
given O
them O
, O
had O
fallen O
but O
upon O
a O
deafened O
ear O
, O
— O
|
| O
something O
about O
a O
gun O
, O
a O
quarrel O
, O
which O
she O
could O
not O
remember O
|

clearly O
. O
Oh O
, O
how O
terrible O
to O
think O
of O
his O
crime O
, O
his O
blood- O

| O
guiltiness O
  O
he O
who O
had O
hitherto O
been O
so O
good O
, O
so O
noble O
, O
and O
|
| O
now O
an O
assassin O
! O
And O
then O
she O
shrank O
from O
him O
in O
thought O
  O
and O
|
| O
then O
, O
with O
bitter O
remorse O
, O
clung O
more O
closely O
to O
his O
image O
with O

passionate O
self O
- O
upbraiding O
. O
Was O
it O
not O
she O
who O
had O
led O
him O
to O

the O
pit O
into O
which O
he O

Was O
she O

She O

to O
judge O
him O

Who O
could O
tell O
how O
maddened O
he O
might O
have O

been O
by O
jealousy O
  O
how O
one B-CARDINAL
moment O
's O
uncontrollable O
passion O
|
| O
might O
have O
led O
him O
to O
become O
a O
murderer O
! O
And O
she O
had O
blamed O
|
| O
him O
in O
her O
heart O
after O
his O
last O
deprecating O
, O
imploring O
, O
prophetic O
|
| O
speech O
! O
|

| O
‘ O
Then O
she O
burst O
out O
crying O
afresh O
  O
and O
when O
weary O
of O
crying O
, O
|
| O
fell O
to O
thinking O
again O
. O
The O
gallows O
! O
The O
gallows O
! O
Black O
it O

stood O
against O
the O

dazzled O
her O

press O
on O
them O
as O
she O
would O
. O
Oh O
! O
she O
was O
going O
mad O
  O

for O

awhile O
she O
lay O
outwardly O
still O

with O
the O
pulses O
careering O

through O
her O
head O
with O
wild O
vehemence O
. O
|

| O
‘ O
And O
then O
came O
a O
strange O
forgetfulness O
of O
the O
present O
, O
in O

| O
thought O
of O
the O

  O
— O
of O
those B-DATE

heard O

be O
her O

her O
error O

those O

something O

There O

enough O
of O

of O

life O
to O
raise O
itself O
under O
the O
dewy O
influences O
of O
night O

She O
hushed O

her O
breath O
in O
involuntary O
awe O

but O
nothing O

told O

Suddenly O

All O

that O

Mary B-PERSON
went O
up O

partly O
because O
it O
is O
the O

the O

etiquette O
forbids O
a O
refusal O
of O

the O
invitation O

totally O

Still O

talked O

“ O
Why O

” O
said O
Mr. O

, O
putting O
down O
his O
pen O
, O
|

“ O

him O

to O
little O
purpose O

I O

afraid O

He O
's O
very O

impracticable O
— O
very O
. O
Itoldhim O
, O
of O

, O
that O
he O

be O

perfectly O

else O
I O

of O
unlocking O
his O

confidence O
, O
but O
— O
” O
|

| O
“ O
What O
did O
he O
say O
? O
” O
asked O
Job B-PERSON
, O
breathlessly O
. O
|

| O
“ O
Why O
, O
very O
little O
. O
He O
barely O
answered O
me O
. O
Indeed O
, O
he O
|
| O
refused O
to O
answer O
some O
questions O
— O
positively O
refused O
. O
I O
do O
n’t O

know O
what O
I O
can O
do O
for O
him O

” O
” O
|

| O
“ O
Then O
you O
think O
him O
guilty O
, O
Sir O
, O
” O
said O
Job B-PERSON
, O
despondingly O
. O
|

| O
“ O
No O
, O
I O
do O
n’t O

replied O
Mr. O

, O
quickly O
and O
decisive- O

ly O
, O
“ O
Much O

with O
an O

on O
the O
word O
, O
“ O
he O

gave O

that O
he O

but O
what O

he O
will O
not O

‘ O
He O
began O

again O

had O
no O

“ O
But O
he O
must O
not O

said O
Job B-PERSON
, O
with O
vehemence O

| O
Mr. O
Bridgenorth B-PERSON
looked O
up O

smiled O
a O
little O
, O

shook O
his O

head O
. O

“ O
What O
did O

tinued O
Job B-LOC

“ O
His O
words O
were O
few O
enough O
, O
and O
he O
was O
so O
reserved O
and O
|
| O
short O
, O
that O
as O
I O
said O
before O
, O
I O
can O
only O
give O
you O
the O
impression O

| O
they O
conveyed O
to O
me O

I O
toldhim O
, O
of O

who O
I O
was O

for O
what O
I O
was O

He O
looked O
pleased O

I O

at O

his O
face O
( O
sad O
enough O
when O
I O
went O
in O

I O
assure O
ye O
) O
brightened O
a O

little O
  O
but O
he O
said O
he O
had O
nothing O
to O
say O
, O
no O
defence O
to O
make O
. O

Jasked B-GPE
him O
if O
he O

  O

by O
way O
of O
opening O
his O

I O
said O
I O
understood O
he O
had O
had O
provocation O
enough O

inas- O

much O
as O
J O
heard O
that O
the O

very O
lovely O

had O
jilted O
him O

| O
There O
was O
a O
true O
bill O
against O
James B-PERSON
Wilson I-PERSON
. O
Ofcourse O
. O
And O
|
| O
yet O
Job B-PERSON
felt O
now O
doubly O
anxious O
and O
sad O
. O
It O
seemed O
the O
begin- O
|
| O
ning O
of O
the O
end O
. O
He O
bad O
got O
, O
by O
imperceptible O
degrees O
, O
to O
think O
|
| O
Jem B-PERSON
innocent O
. O
Little O
by O
little O
this O
persuasion O
had O
come O
upon O
him O
. O
|

| O
Mary B-PERSON
( O
tossing O
about O
in O
the O
little O
boat O
on O
the O
broad O
river O
) O
did O
|
| O
not O
come O
, O
nor O
did O
Will O
. O
|

| O
Job O
grew O
very O
restless O
. O
He O
longed O
to O
go O
and O
watch O
for O
them O
|
| O
out O
ofthe O
window O
, O
but O
feared O
to O
interrupt O
Mr. O
Bridgenorth B-PERSON
. O
At O
|
| O
length O
his O
desire O
to O
look O
out O
was O
irresistible O
, O
and O
he O
got O
up O
and O
|
| O
walked O
carefully O
and O
gently O
across O
the O
room O
, O
his O
boots O
creaking O
|
| O
at O
every O
cautious O
step O
. O
The O
gloom O
which O
had O
overspread O
the O
|
| O
sky O
, O
and O
the O
influence O
of O
which O
had O
been O
felt O
by O
Mary B-PERSON
on O
the O
|
| O
open O
water O
, O
was O
yet O
more O
perceptible O
in O
the O
dark O
, O
dull O
street O
. O
|
| O
Job O
grew O
more O
and O
more O
fidgety O
. O
He O
was O
obliged O
to O
walk O
about O
|
| O
the O
room O
, O
for O
he O
could O
not O
keep O
still O
  O
and O
he O
did O
so O
, O
regardless O
|
| O
of O
Mr. O
Bridgenorth B-PERSON
’s O
impatient O
little O
motions O
and O
noises O
, O
asthe O
|
| O
slow O
, O
stealthy O
, O
creaking O
movements O
were O
heard O
, O
backwards O
and O
|
| O
forwards O
, O
behind O
his O
chair O
. O
|

| O
He O
really O
liked O
Job O
, O
and O
was O
interested O
for O
Jem B-PERSON
, O
else O
his O
|
| O
nervousness O
would O
have O
overcome O
his O
sympathy O
long O
before O
it O
|
| O
did O
. O
But O
he O
could O
hold O
out O
no O
longer O
against O
the O
monotonous O
, O
|
| O
grating O
sound O
  O
so O
at O
last O
he O
threw O
down O
his O
pen O
, O
locked O
his O
|
| O
portfolio O
, O
and O
taking O
up O
his O
hat O
and O
gloves O
, O
told O
Job B-PERSON
he O
must O
go O

to O
the O

“ O

dreaded O

“ O

which O
could O
not O

be O
many O

partly O
owing O
to O
her O

which O
left O
a O
stamp O

, O
for O
an O
instant O

a O
look O
of O
indignation O
contracted O
Mary B-PERSON

, O
in O

such O
intense O

— O
such O
a O
deprecating O
dread O

suddenly O
her O

The O

was O
every O

  O
the O

vast O

it O
was O
maddening O

think O

now O
she O
might O
own O
her O
fault O

but O
now O
she O
might O
even O

own O
her O
love O

Now O
, O
when O
the O

stood O
thus O

abhorred O

of O

there O
would O

she O
also O
turned O
towards O

partly O

to O
mark O
that O
her O

Job B-PERSON

looked O

had O
gained O
, O
and O

given O
, O
some O
idea O
of O
the O
position O

At O
last O
he O
saw O
her O
, O

standing O
by O
a O
decent O

looking O
woman O
, O
looking O
flushed O

anxious O

and O
moving O
her O

he O

When O
he O
bad O

she O
took O
no O

wild O

restless O

He O
tried O
to O
hear O
the O
low O
quick O
mutterings O
of O
her O
voice O
  O
|
| O
he O
caught O
the O
repetition O
of O
the O
same O
words O
over O
and O
over O
again O
. O

“ O

turned O
away O

still O
hovered O
between O

when O

arrived O

at O
the O

the O

if O
not O

was O

less O

than O

lay O
now O

astupor O

after O

And O
now O
Jem B-PERSON
found O
the O
difficulty O
which O
every O
one O
who O
has O

watched O
by O
a O
sick O
bed O
knows O
full O
well O
  O
and O
which O
is O
perhaps O
|
| O
more O
insurmountable O
to O
men O
than O
it O
is O
to O
women O
, O
— O
the O
difficulty O
|
| O
of O
being O
patient O
, O
and O
trying O
not O
to O
expect O
any O
visible O
change O
for O

long O
, O
long O
hours O
of O
sad O
monotony O

But O
after O
awhile O
the O
reward O
came O
. O
The O
laboured O
breathing O

became O
lower O
and O
softer O
, O
the O
heavy O
look O
of O
oppressive O
pain O
|
| O
melted O
away O
from O
the O
face O
, O
and O
a O
languor O
that O
was O
almost O
peace O

took O
the O
place O

spoke O
low O

softly O
, O

hardly O

to O

some O

suspected O

been O
a O

was O

when O

  O
the O

that O

Jem B-PERSON
felt O
that O
his O

attainted O
  O
and O
that O

| O
to O
many O
it O
might O

He O

that O

at O

the O
occurrences O

, O
he O
found O
his O
mother O
busy O
about O
her O

mourning O
, O
and O
much O
inclined O
to O
talk O
. O
Although O
he O
longed O
for O
|
| O
quiet O
, O
he O
could O
not O
avoid O
sitting O
down O
and O
answering O
her O
|

questions O
. O
|

“ O

“ O
Oh O

Job O
came O
over O

Did O

make O

” O
|

It O
struck O
Jem B-PERSON
that O
she O
had O
not O
heard O
of O
the O
confession O

had O
been O
made O
byJohn O
Barton B-PERSON
on O
his O
death O

  O
he O
remembered O
|
| O
Job B-PERSON
Legh I-PERSON
’s I-PERSON
discretion O
, O
and O
he O
determined O
that O
if O
it O
could O
be O
|
| O
avoided O
his O
mother O
should O
never O
hear O
of O
it O
. O
Many O
of O
the O
diffi- O
|
| O
culties O
to O
be O
anticipated O
in O
preserving O
the O
secret O
would O
be O
ob- O
|
| O
viated O
, O
if O
he O
could O
induce O
his O
mother O
to O
fall O
into O
the O
plan O
he O
had O
|
| O
named O
to O
Mary B-PERSON
of O
emigrating O
to O
Canada B-GPE
. O
The O
reasons O
which O
|
| O
rendered O
this O
secrecy O
desirable O
related O
to O
the O
domestic O
happiness O
|
| O
he O
hoped O
for O
. O
With O
his O
mother O
’s O
irritable O
temper O
he O
could O
hardly O
|
| O
expect O
that O
all O
allusion O
to O
the O
crime O
of O
John B-PERSON
Barton I-PERSON
would O
be O
for O
|
| O
ever O
restrained O
from O
passing O
her O
lips O
, O
and O
he O
knew O
the O
deep O
trial O
|
| O
which O
such O
references O
would O
be O
to O
Mary B-PERSON
. O
Accordingly O
he O
re- O
|
| O
solved O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
in O
the B-TIME
morning I-TIME
to O
goto O
Job O
, O
and O
be- O
|

seech O
his O

  O
he O
trusted O
that O
secrecy O
in O
that B-DATE

even O
if O

the O
knowledge O

might O

vanished O

Nay O
, O
even O

energy O

his O

now O
the O

from O
