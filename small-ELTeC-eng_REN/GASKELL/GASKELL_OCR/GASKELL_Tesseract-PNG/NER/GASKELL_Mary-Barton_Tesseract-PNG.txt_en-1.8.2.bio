more O

” O

“ O
That O

My O

my O

I O
spoke O
crossly O

I O
meant O
right O

I O
loved O
Esther S-PERSON
, O
if O
it O
was O
only O
for O
Mary’s S-PERSON

Says O
I O

‘ O

The O

still O

made O
this O
sudden O
call O
upon O

then O
he O
begged O
Barton S-PERSON
just O

himself O

Barton S-PERSON
absolutely O
stamped O

outside O

down O

the O
medical O

several O

asked O
him O
to O
go O
slower O

“ O
Is O
she O
so O
very O
bad O
? O
” O
asked O
he O

“ O
Worse O

John S-PERSON

no O

He O

been O
tinged O

the O
very O
information O

And O
Margaret’s S-PERSON
grandfather O
was O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
these O
. O
He O
was O
a O
little O
wiry O
- O
looking O
old O
man O
, O
who O
moved O
with O
a O
jerking O
mo- O
tion O
, O
as O
if O
his O
limbs O
were O
worked O
by O
a O
string O
like O
a O
child’s O
toy O
, O
with O
dun-coloured O
hair O
lying O
thin O

soft O
at O
the O
back O

sides O
of O
his O
head O

his O
forehead O
was O
so O
large O
it O
séemed O
to O
overbalance O
the O
rest O
of O
his O
face O
, O
which O
had O
, O
indeed O
, O
lost O
its O
natural O
contour O
by O
the O
absence O
of O
all O
the O
teeth O
. O
The O
eyes O
absolutely O
gleamed O
with O
intelligence O

so O
keen O
, O
so O
observant O
, O
you O
felt O
as O
if O
they O
were O
almost O
wizard O
- O
like O
. O
Indeed O
, O
the O
whole O
room O
looked O
not O
unlike O
a O
wizard’s O
dwelling O
. O
Instead O
of O
pictures O
were O
hung O
rude O
wooden O
frames O
of O
impaled O
insects O

the O
little O
table O
was O
covered O
with O
cabalistic O
books O

beside O
them O
lay O
a O
case O
of O
mysterious O
instruments O
, O
one O
of O
which O
Job B-PERSON
Legh E-PERSON
was O
using O
when O
his O
granddaughter O
entered O

‘ O
On O
her O
appearance O
he O
pushed O
his O
spectacles O
up O
so O
as O
to O
rest O
midway O
on O
his O
forehead O
, O
and O
gave O
Mary S-PERSON
a O
short O
, O
kind O
welcome O
. O
But O
Margaret S-PERSON
he O
caressed O
as O
a O
mother O
caresses O
her O
first S-ORDINAL
born O

stroking O
her O
with O
tenderness O
, O
and O
almost O
altering O
his O
voice O
as O
he O
spoke O
to O
her O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
looked O
round O
on O
the O
odd O
, O
strange O
things O
she O
had O
never O
seen O
at O
home O
, O
and O
which O
seemed O
to O
her O
to O
havea O
very O
uncanny O
look O
. O
“ O
Is O
your O
grandfather O
a O
fortune O
- O
teller O
? O
” O
whispered O
she O
to O
her O
new O
friend O
. O
“ O
No O
, O
” O
replied O
Margaret S-PERSON
, O
in O
the O
same O
voice O

“ O

I O
couldn't O
fairly O

how O

he O

down O
over O
him O

to O
look O
at O
him O
better O

and O
grandfather O
got O
a O
book O
, O

began O
to O
read O
how O
this O
very O
kind O
were O
the O
most O
poisonous O

vicious O
species O
, O
how O
their O
bite O
were O
often O
fatal O

then O
went O
on O
to O
read O
how O
people O
who O
were O
bitten O
got O
swelled O

screamed O
with O
pain O

I O
was O
listening O
hard O

as O
it O
fell O
out O

I O
never O

I O

hopeful O

When O
he O
reached O
Berry B-FAC
Street E-FAC
, O
he O
had O
persuaded O
himself O
he O
bore O
good O
news O
, O
and O
felt O
almost O
elated O
in O
his O
heart O
. O
Butit S-PERSON
fell O
when O
he O
opened O
the O
cellar O
- O
door O
, O
and O
saw O
Barton S-PERSON
and O
the O
wife O
both O
bending O
over O
the O
sick O
man’s O
couch O
with O
awe O
- O
struck O
, O
saddened O
look O
. O
“ O
Come O
here O
, O
” O
said O
Barton S-PERSON
. O
“ O
There O
’s O
a O
change O
comed O
over O
him O
sin’ O
yo O
left O
, O
is O
there O
not O
? O
” O
Wilson S-PERSON
looked O
. O
The O
flesh O
was O
sunk O
, O
the O
features O
pro- O
minent O
, O
bony O
, O
and O
rigid O
. O
The O
fearful O
clay O
- O
colour O
of O
death O
was O
overall O
. O
But O
the O
eyes O
were O
open O
and O
sensitive O
, O
though O
the O
films O
of O
the O
grave O
were O
setting O
upon O
them O
. O
“ O
He O
wakened O
fra O
his O
sleep O
, O
as O
yo O
left O
him O
in O
, O
and O
began O
to O
mutter O
and O
moan O
| | O
but O
he O
soon O
went O
off O
again O
, O
and O
we O
never O
knew O
he O
were O
awake O
till O
he O
called O
his O
wife O
, O
but O
now O
she O
’s O
here O
he’s O
gotten O
nought O
to O
say O
to O
her O
. O
” O
Most O
probably O
, O
as O
they O
all O
felt O
, O
he O
could O
not O
speak O
, O
for O
his O
strength O
was O
fast O
ebbing O
. O
‘ O
They O
stood O
round O
him O
still O
and O
silent O
| | O
even O
the O
wife O
checked O
her O
sobs O
, O
though O
her O
heart O
was O
like O
to O
break O
. O
She O
held O
her O
child O
to O
her O
breast O
, O
to O
try O
and O
keep O
him O
quiet O
. O
Their O
eyes O
were O
all O
fixed O
on O
the O
yet O
living O
one O
, O
whose O
moments O
of O
life O
were O
passing O
so O
rapidly O
away O
. O
At O
78 S-CARDINAL
anger O
, O
in O
the O
anxious O
desire O
to O
comfort O
the O
poor O
lone O
woman O
. O
Never O
had O
her O
sweet O
face O
looked O
more O
angelic O
, O
never O
had O
her O
gentle O
voice O
seemed O
so O
musical O
as O
when O
she O
murmured O
her O
broken O
sentences O
of O
comfort O
. O
“ O
Oh O
, O
don’t O
cry O
so O
, O
dear O
Mrs. O
Davenport S-PERSON
, O
pray O
don’t O
take O
on O
so O
. O
Sure O
he’s O
gone O
where O
he'll O
never O
know O
care O
again O
. O
Yes O
, O
Iknow O
how O
lonesome O
you O
must O
feel O

but O
think O
of O
your O
children O
. O
Oh O
! O
we O
' O
Il O
all O
help O
to O
earn O
food O
for O
’em O

Think O
how O
sorry O
he’d O
be O
, O
ifhe O
sees O
you O
fretting O
so O
. O
Don’t O
cry O
so O
, O
please O
don’t O
. O
” O
‘ O
And O
she O
ended O
by O
crying O
herself O
as O
passionately O
as O
the O
poor O
widow O
. O
Tt O
was O
agreed O
the O
town O
must O
bury O
him O
| | O
he O
had O
paid O
to O
a O
burial O
club O
as O
long O
as O
he O
could O
, O
but O
by O
a O
few O
weeks’ O
omis- O
sion O
, O
he O
had O
forfeited O
his O
claim O
to O
a O
sum O
of O
money O
now O
. O
Would O
Mrs. O
Davenport S-PERSON
and O
the O
little O
child O
go O
home O
with O
Mary S-PERSON
? O
The O
latter O
brightened O
up O
as O
she O
urged O
this O
plan O
| | O
but O
no O
! O
where O
the O
poor O
, O
fondly O
loved O
remains O
were O
, O
there O
would O
the O
mourner O
be O
| | O
and O
all O
that O
they O
could O
do O
was O
to O
make O
her O
as O
comfortable O
as O
their O
funds O
would O
allow O
, O
and O
to O
beg O
a O
neigh- O
bour O
to O
look O
in O
and O
say O
a O
word O
at O
times O
. O
So O
she O
was O
left O
alone O
with O
her O
dead O
, O
and O
they O
went O
to O
work O
that O
had O
work O
, O
and O
he O
who O
had O
none O
, O
took O
upon O
him O
the O
arrangements O
for O
the O
funeral O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
had O
many O
a O
scolding O
from O
Miss O
Simmonds S-PERSON
that O
day O
for O
her O
absence O
of O
mind O
. O
To O
be O
sure O
Miss O
Simmonds S-PERSON
was O
much O
put O
out O
by O
Mary’s S-PERSON
non-appearance O
in O
the O
morning O
with O
certain O
bits O
of O
muslin O
, O
and O
shades O
of O
silk O
which O
were O
wanted O
to O
complete O
adress O
to O
be O
worn O
that O
night O
| | O
but O
it O
was O
true O
enough O
that O
Mary S-PERSON
did O
not O
mind O
what O
she O
was O
about O
| | O
she O
was O
too O
busy O
planning O
how O
her O
old O
black O
gown O
( O
her O
best O
when O
her O
mother O
died O
) O
might O
be O
spunged O
, O
and O
turned O
, O
and O
lengthened O
into O
something O
like O
decent O
mourning O
for O
the O
widow O
. O
And O
when O
she O
went O
home O
at O
night O
( O
though O
it O
was O
very O
late O
, O
asa O
sort O
of O
retribution O
for O
her O
morning’s O
negligence O
) O
, O
she O
set O
to O
work O
at O
once O
, O
and O
was O
so O
busy O
and O
so O
glad O
over O
her O
task O
, O
that O
she O
had O
, O
every O
now O
and O
then O
, O
to O
check O
herself O
in O
singing O
merry O
ditties O
, O
80 S-CARDINAL
shillings O
beforehand O
with O
the O
world O
. O
She O
determined O
to O
flit O
from O
that O
cellar O
to O
another O
less O
full O
of O
painful O
associations O
, O
leas O
haunted O
by O
mournful O
memories O
. O
The O
board O
, O
not O
so O
for- O
midable O
as O
she O
had O
imagined O
, O
had O
inquired O
into O
her O
case O
| | O
and O
, O
instead O
of O
sending O
her O
to O
Stoke B-ORG
Claypole E-ORG
, O
her O
husband’s O
Buckinghamshire S-GPE
parish O
, O
as O
she O
had O
dreaded O
, O
had O
agreed O
to O
pay O
her O
rent O
. O
So O
food O
for O
four S-CARDINAL
mofths O
was O
all O
she O
was O
now O
required O
to O
find O
| | O
only O
for O
three S-CARDINAL
she O
would O
have O
said O
| | O
for O
her- O
self O
, O
and O
the O
unweaned O
child O
were O
but O
reckoned O
as O
one O
in O
her O
calculation O
. O
She O
had O
a O
strong O
heart O
, O
now O
her O
bodily O
strength O
had O
been O
recruited O
by O
a B-DATE
week E-DATE
or O
two S-CARDINAL
of O
food O
, O
and O
she O
would O
not O
despair O
. O
So O
she O
took O
in O
some O
little O
children O
to O
nurse O
, O
who O
brought O
their O
daily O
food O
with O
them O
, O
which O
she O
cooked O
for O
them O
, O
without O
wronging O
their O
helplessness O
of O
a O
crumb O
| | O
and O
when O
she O
had O
restored O
them O
to O
their O
mother’s O
at O
night O
, O
she O
set O
to O
work O
at O
plain O
sewing O
, O
“ O
seam O
, O
and O
gusset O
, O
and O
band O
, O
” O
and O
sat O
thinking O
how O
she O
might O
best O
cheat O
the O
factory O
in O
- O
spector O
, O
and O
persuade O
him O
that O
her O
strong O
, O
big O
, O
hungry O
Ben S-PERSON
, O
was O
above O
thirteen O
. O
Her O
plan O
of O
living O
was O
so O
far O
arranged O
, O
when O
she O
heard O
, O
with O
keen O
sorrow O
, O
that O
Wilson's O
twin O
lads O
were O
ill O
of O
the O
fever O
. O
They O
had O
never O
been O
strong O
. O
They O
were O
like O
many O
a O
pair O
of O
twins O
, O
and O
seemed O
to O
have O
but O
one S-CARDINAL
life O
divided O
between O
them O
. O
One S-CARDINAL
life O
, O
one S-CARDINAL
strength O
, O
and O
in O
this O
instance O
, O
I O
might O
almost O
say O
, O
one S-CARDINAL
brain O
| | O
for O
they O
were O
helpless O
, O
gentle O
, O
silly O
children O
, O
but O
not O
the O
less O
dear O
to O
their O
parents O
and O
to O
their O
strong O
, O
active O
, O
manly O
, O
elder O
brother O
. O
They O
were O
late O
on O
their O
feet O
, O
late O
in O
talking O
, O
late O
every O
way O
| | O
had O
to O
be O
nursed O
and O
cared O
for O
when O
other O
lads O
of O
their O
age O
were O
tumbling O
about O
in O
the O
street O
, O
and O
losing O
themselves O
, O
and O
being O
taken O
to O
the O
police O
- O
office O
miles O
away O
from O
home O
. O
Still O
want O
had O
never O
yet O
come O
in O
at O
the O
door O
to O
make O
love O
, O
for O
these O
innocents O
fly O
out O
of O
the O
window O
. O
Nor O
was O
this O
the O
case O
even O
now O
, O
when O
Jem B-PERSON
Wilson's E-PERSON
earnings O
, O
and O
his O
mother’s O
occasional O
charrings O
were O
barely O
sufficient O
to O
give O
all O
the O
family O
their O
fll O
of O
food O
. O
where O
hope O
there O
was O
none O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
stepped O
slowly O
and O
lightly O
across O
to O
Alice S-PERSON
. O
“ O
Ay O
, O
poorlad O
! O
God O
has O
taken O
him O
early O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
” O
Mary S-PERSON
could O
not O
speak O
| | O
she O
did O
not O
know O
what O
to O
say O
| | O
it O
was O
so O
much O
worse O
than O
she O
had O
expected O
. O
At O
last O
she O
ven- O
tured O
to O
whisper O
, O
“ O
Ts O
there O
any O
chance O
for O
the O
other O
one O
, O
think O
you O
? O
” O
Alice S-PERSON
shook O
her O
head O
, O
and O
told O
with O
a O
look O
that O
she O
be- O
lieved O
there O
was O
none O
. O
She O
next O
endeavoured O
to O
lift O
the O
little O
body O
, O
and O
carry O
it O
to O
its O
old O
- O
accustomed O
bed O
in O
its O
parent’s O
room O
. O
But O
earnest O
as O
the O
father O
was O
in O
watching O
the O
yet O
- O
living O
, O
he O
had O
eyes O
and O
ears O
for O
all O
that O
concerned O
the O
dead O
, O
and O
sprang O
gently O
up O
, O
and O
took O
his O
dead O
son O
on O
his O
hard O
couch O
in O
his O
arms O
with O
tender O
strength O
, O
and O
carried O
him O
up O
- O
stairs O
as O
if O
afraid O
o’ O
wakening O
him O
. O
‘ O
The O
other O
child O
gasped O
longer O
, O
louder O
, O
with O
more O
of O
effort O
. O
“ O
We O
mun O
get O
him O
away O
from O
his O
mother O
. O
He O
cannot O
die O
while O
she’s O
wishing O
him O
. O
” O
“ O
Wishing O
him O
? O
” O
said O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
in O
atone O
of O
inquiry O
. O
“ O
Ay O

donno’ O
ye O
know O
what O

arms O
of O
those O

The O
soul O
o’ O
them O
as O
holds O
them O
won’t O
let O
the O
dying O
soul O
go O
free O

so O
it O
has O
a O
hard O
struggle O
for O

fellow O

” O
So O
without O
circumlocution O
she O
went O
and O
offered O
to O
take O
the O
sinking O
child O
. O
But O
the O
mother O
would O
not O
let O
him O
go O
, O
and O
looking O
in O
Alice’s O
face O
with O
brimming O
and O
imploring O
eyes O
, O
declared O
in O
earnest O
whispers O
, O
that O
she O
was O
not O

him O

that O

him O
released O

Alice S-PERSON

stood O
by O
with O
eyes O
fixed O
on O
the O
poor O
child O

struggles O
seemed O
to O
increase O

at O

Her O

“ O

Such O
is O
the O

of O
the O

from O

that O

So O
Mary S-PERSON
dwelt O
upon O
and O
enjoyed O
the O
idea O
of O
some O
day O
becoming O
a O

and O
doing O
all O
the O

It O
was O
a O
comfort O
to O
her O
, O
when O
scolded O
by O
Miss O
Simmonds S-PERSON
, O
to O
think O
of O
the O
day O
when O
she O
would O
drive O
up O

to O
order O
her O
gowns O
from O
the O
hasty O
- O
tempered O
yet O
kind O
dressmaker O
. O
It O
was O
a O
pleasure O
to O
her O
to O
hear O
the O
general O
admiration O
of O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
elder O

on O

on O

to O

But O
the O

of O

the O

that O
which O
in O
some O

How O

There O

something O
crooked O
in O
her O
con- O

after O
all O

for O
this O
very O

seemed O
an O

that O
it O

wrong O

yet O
she O

herself O
to O
think O
her O
conduct O
quite O
innocent O

, O
proper O
, O
for O
although O
unknown O

her O

certain O

even O
did O
he O

But O
now O
that O

, O
made O
so O
by O
Mr. O
Carsons S-PERSON
himself O
. O
He O
had O
felt O
the O
necessity O
of O
* O
some O
third S-ORDINAL
person O
to O
carry O
letters O

messages O
, O
and O
to O
plead O
his O

when O
he O

In O
a O
girl O
named O
Sally B-PERSON
Leadbitter E-PERSON
he O
had O
found O
a O
willing O
advocate O

She O
would O

willing O

, O
for O
the O
mere O
excitement O
of O
the O

but O
her O
willingness O
was O
strengthened O
by O
sundry O
half S-CARDINAL
- O
sovereigns O
, O
which O
from O
time O
to O
time O
Mr. O
Carsons S-PERSON
bestowed O
upon O
her O

Sally B-PERSON
Leadbitter E-PERSON
was O
vulgar O
- O
minded O
to O
the O
last O
degree O

never O
easy O
unless O
her O
talk O
was O
of O

lovers O

in O
her O

it O
was O
an O
honour O

along O
list O
of O
wooers O

So O
con- O
stituted O
, O
it O
was O
a O
pity O
that O
Sally S-PERSON

was O

After O
parting O

determined O

as O
it O
was O
not O

very O
late O

found O

great O

She O

just O

all O

Though O
not O
guarded O
from O
unnecessary O
sight O

sound O
of O
death O
, O
as O
the O
children O

Her O

the O

At O
any O

the O

her O

so O
feared O

Such O
were O
the O

over O

She O
could O
not O

for O

she O
felt O
that O
this O

she O
could O
keep O

And O
in O
this O
shock O
of O

, O
Sally B-PERSON

was O
the O

“ O

Mary S-PERSON

the O
poor O

thoughts O
had O
gone O
back O

those B-DATE

Mary S-PERSON
went O
very O

wished O

Mrs. O

” O
Mary S-PERSON
went O
very O
red O

looked O
annoyed O

there O
was O
a O
secret O
spring O

joy O
deep O
down O
in O
her O
heart O
, O
at O
hearing O

so O
spoken O

But O
his O

only O
saw O
the O
annoyed O
look O

was O
piqued O
accordingly O

She O
was O
not O
over O

above O
desirous O
that O
her O
son O

His O
presence O
in O
the O
house O
seemed O
arelic O
of O
happier O
times O

she O
had O
some O
little O
jealousy O
of O
his O
future O

she O
might O

she O
could O
not O

any O

feel O

flattered O
by O

full O

she O
knew O
how O

Now O
she O
had O
never O
thought O

good O

her O

still O

rankled O
a O
little O
in O

she O
determined O

invent O
a O
little O

away O

He O

a O

him O

he O
did O
not O

A O
little O
farther O

the O
person O
quickened O
step O

touched O
his O

very O

He O
turned O

saw O
, O
even O
by O
the O

of O
that O
badly O

that O
the O

It O
was O
told O
by O
her O

did O
her O

deadly O

around O

in O

He O
flung O

trembling O

from O
him O

strode O

lay O
there O

A O

came O
up O
in O

see O
the O
close O
of O
these O

concluding O
from O
Esther’s S-PERSON
unsteady O
, O
reeling O
fall O

that O
she O
was O
tipsy O

her O
half S-CARDINAL

unconscious O
state O
to O
the O

The O
superintendent O
of O
that O
abode O
of O
vice O
and O
misery O
, O
was O
roused O
from O
his O
dozing O
watch O
through O
the O
dark O
hours O
, O
by O
half S-CARDINAL
- O
delirious O
wails O
and O
moanings O
, O
which O
he O
reported O
as O
arising O
from O
intoxication O

If O
he O
had O
listened O
he O
‘ O
would O
have O
heard O
these O
words O
, O
repeated O
in O
various O
forms O
, O
but O
always O
in O
the O
same O
anxious O
, O
muttering O
way O

“ O

She O

loving O
just O

She O
won't O
hearken O
to O
warning O

heed O
it O
more O
thanI O
did O

who O

well O
enough O

He O
would O
not O

” O
” O
So O
the O
night O
wore O
away O
. O
‘ O
The O
next O
morning O
she O
was O
taken O
up O
to O
the B-FAC
New I-FAC
Bailey E-FAC
. O
It O
was O
a O
clear O
case O
of O
disorderly O
vagrancy O
, O
and O
she O
was O
committed O
to O
prison O
fora O
month O
. O
How O
much O
might O
happen O
in O
that O
time O
! O
140 S-CARDINAL
every O
fantastic O
, O
discreditable O
bonnet O
, O
in O
the O
hopes O
of O
once O
more O
meeting O
Esther S-PERSON
, O
and O
addressing O
her O
in O
a O
far O
different O
manner O
from O
what O
he O
had O
done O
before O
. O
But O
he O
returned O
, O
night B-TIME
after I-TIME
night E-TIME
, O
disappointed O
in O
his O
search O
, O
and O
at O
last O
gave O
it O
up O
in O
despair O
, O
and O
tried O
to O
recall O
his O
angry O
feelings O
towards O
her O
, O
in O
order O
to O
find O
relief O
from O
his O
present O
self O
- O
reproach O
. O
He O
often O
looked O
at O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
and O
wished O
she O
were O
not O
so O
like O
her O
aunt O
, O
for O
the O
very O
bodily O
likeness O
seemed O
to O
suggest O
the O
possibility O
of O
a O
similar O
likeness O
in O
their O
fate O
| | O
and O
then O
this O
idea O
enraged O
his O
irritable O
mind O
, O
and O
he O
became O
suspicious O
and O
anxious O
about O
Mary’s S-PERSON
conduct O
. O
Now O
hitherto O
she O
had O
been O
so O
remarkably O
free O
from O
all O
control O
, O
and O
almost O
from O
all O
inquiry O
concerning O
her O
actions O
, O
that O
she O
did O
not O
brook O
this O
change O
in O
her O
father’s O
behaviour O
very O
well O
. O
Just O
when O
she O
was O
yielding O
more O
than O
ever O
to O
Mr. O
Carsons’ S-PERSON
desire O
of O
fre- O
quent O
meetings O
, O
it O
was O
hard O
to O
be O
so O
questioned O
concerning O
her O
hours O
of O
leaving O
off O
work O
, O
whether O
she O
had O
come O
straight O
home O
, O
&c O
. O
She O
could O
not O
tell O
lies O
| | O
though O
she O
could O
conceal O
much O
if O
she O
were O
not O
questioned O
. O
So O
she O
took O
refuge O
in O
ob- O
stinate O
silence O
, O
alleging O
as O
a O
reason O
for O
it O
her O
indignation O
at O
being O
so O
cross-examined O
. O
This O
did O
not O
add O
to O
the O
good O
feeling O
between O
father O
and O
daughter O
, O
and O
yet O
they O
dearly O
loved O
each O
other O
| | O
and O
in O
the O
minds O
of O
each O
, O
one S-CARDINAL
principal O
reason O
for O
maintaining O
such O
behaviour O
as O
displeased O
the O
other O
, O
was O
the O
believing O
that O
this O
conduct O
would O
insure O
that O
person’s O
happiness O
. O
Her O
father O
now O
began O
to O
wish O
Mary S-PERSON
were O
married O
. O
Then O
this O
terrible O
superstitious O
fear O
suggested O
by O
her O
likeness O
to O
Esther S-PERSON
would O
be O
done O
away O
with O
. O
He O
felt O
that O
he O
could O
not O
resume O
the O
reins O
he O
had O
once O
slackened O
. O
But O
with O
a O
husband O
it O
would O
be O
different O
. O
If O
Jem B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
would O
but O
marry O
her O
! O
With O
his O
character O
for O
steadiness O
and O
talent O
! O
But O
he O
was O
afraid O
Mary S-PERSON
had O
slighted O
him O
, O
he O
came O
so O
seldom O
now O
to O
the O
house O
. O
He O
would O
ask O
her O
. O
“ O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
what’s O
come O
o’er O
thee O
and O
Jem B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON

Yo O
were O
great O
friends O
at O
one S-CARDINAL
time O

” O
“ O
Oh O
, O
folk O
say O
he’s O
going O
to O
be O
married O
to O
Molly B-PERSON
Gibson E-PERSON
, O
142 S-CARDINAL
He O
believed O
he O
only O
delayed O
before O
his O
little O
looking O
- O
glass O
for O
cowardice O
, O
for O
absolute O
fear O
of O
a O
girl O
. O
He O
would O
try O
not O
to O
think O
so O
much O
about O
the O
affair O
, O
and O
he O
thought O
the O
more O
. O
Poor O
Jem S-PERSON
! O
it O
is O
not O
an O
auspicious O
moment O
for O
thee O
! O
“ O
Come O
in O
, O
” O
said O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
as O
some O
one O
knocked O
at O
the O
door O
, O
while O
she O
sat O
sadly O
at O
her O
sewing O
, O
trying O
to O
earn O
a B-MONEY
few I-MONEY
pence E-MONEY
by O
working O
over O
hours O
at O
some O
mourning O
. O
Jem S-PERSON
entered O
, O
looking O
more O
awkward O
and O
abashed O
than O
he O
had O
ever O
done O
before O
. O
Yet O
here O
was O
Mary S-PERSON
all O
alone O
, O
just O
as O
he O
had O
hoped O
to O
find O
her O
. O
She O
did O
not O
ask O
him O
to O
take O
a O
chair O
, O
but O
after O
standing O
a B-TIME
minute I-TIME
or I-TIME
two E-TIME
he O
sat O
down O
near O
her O
. O
“ O
Ts O
your O
father O
at O
home O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
? O
” O
said O
he O
, O
by O
way O
of O
making O
an O
opening O
, O
for O
she O
seemed O
determined O
to O
keep O
silence O
, O
and O
went O
on O
stitching O
away O
. O
“ O
No O
, O
he’s O
gone O
to O
his O
Union S-ORG
, O
I O
suppose O
. O
” O
Another O
silence O
. O
It O
was O
no O
use O
waiting O
, O
thought O
Jem S-PERSON
. O
The O
subject O
would O
never O
be O
led O
to O
by O
any O
talk O
he O
could O
think O
of O
in O
his O
anxious O
fluttered O
state O
. O
He O
had O
better O
begin O
at O
once O
. O
“ O
Mary S-PERSON
! O
” O
said O
he O
, O
and O
the O
unusual O
tone O
of O
his O
voice O
made O
her O
look O
up O
for O
an O
instant O
, O
but O
in O
that O
time O
she O
understood O
from O
his O
countenance O
what O
was O
coming O
, O
and O
her O
heart O
beat O
so O
suddenly O
and O
violently O
she O
could O
hardly O
sit O
stil O
. O
Yet O
one S-CARDINAL
thing O
she O
was O
sure O
of O
| | O
nothing O
he O
could O
say O
should O
make O
her O
have O
him O
. O
She O
would O
show O
them O
all O
who O
would O
be O
glad O
to O
have O
her O
. O
She O
was O
not O
yet O
calm O
after O
her O
father’s O
irritating O
speeches O
. O
Yet O
her O
eyes O
fell O
veiled O
before O
that O
passionate O
look O
fixed O
upon O
her O
. O
“ O
Dear O

I’d O
no O

I O
scorned O

I O
lived O

terror O

” O
said O
he O
, O
suddenly O
changing O
his O
tone O
from O
threatening O
despair O
to O
fond O
passionate O
entreaty O
, O
as O
he O
took O
her O
hand O
and O
held O
it O
forcibly O
between O
both O
of O
his O
, O
while O
he O
tried O
to O
catch O
a O
glimpse O
of O
her O
averted O
face O
. O
She O
was O
silent O
, O
but O
it O
was O
from O
deep O
and O
violent O
emotion O
. O
He O
could O
not O
bear O
to O
wait O
| | O
he O
would O
not O
hope O
, O
to O
be O
dashed O
away O
again O
| | O
he O
rather O
in O
his O
bitterness O
of O
heart O
chose O
the O
certainty O
of O
despair O
, O
and O
before O
she O
could O
resolve O
what O
to O
answer O
, O
he O
flung O
away O
her O
hand O
and O
rushed O
out O
of O
the O
house O
. O
“ O
Jem O
! O
Jem O
! O
” O
cried O
she O
, O
with O
faint O
and O
choking O
voice O
. O
It O
was O
too O
late O
| | O
he O
left O
strect O
after O
street O
behind O
him O
with O
his O
almost O
winged O
speed O
, O
as O
he O
sought O
the O
fields O
, O
where O
he O
might O
give O
way O
unobserved O
to O
all O
the O
deep O
despair O
he O
felt O
. O
It O
was O
scarcely O
ten B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
since O
he O
had O
entered O
the O
house O
, O
and O
found O
Mary S-PERSON
at O
comparative O
peace O
, O
and O
now O
she O
lay O
half O
across O
the O
dresser O
, O
her O
head O
hidden O
in O
her O
hands O
, O
and O
every O
part O
of O
her O
body O
shaking O
with O
the O
violence O
of O
her O
sobs O
. O
She O
could O
not O
have O
told O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
( O
if O
you O
had O
asked O
her O
, O
and O
she O
could O
have O
commanded O
voice O
enough O
to O
answer O
) O
why O
she O
was O
in O
such O
agonised O
grief O
. O
It O
was O
too O
sudden O
for O
her O
to O
analyse O
, O
or O
think O
upon O
it O
. O
She O
only O
felt O
, O
that O
by O
her O
own O
doing O
her O
life O
would O
be O
hereafter O
blank O
and O
dreary O
. O
By O
- O
and O
- O
bye O
her O
sorrow O
exhausted O
her O
body O
by O
its O
power O
, O
and O
she O
seemed O
to O
have O
no O
strength O
left O
for O
crying O
, O
She O
sat O
down O
| | O
and O
now O
thoughts O
crowded O
on O
her O
mind O
. O
One B-TIME
little I-TIME
hour I-TIME
ago E-TIME
, O
and O
all O
‘ O
was O
still O
unsaid O
, O
and O
she O
had O
her O
fate O
in O
her O
own O
power O
. O
And O
yet O
, O
how O
long O
ago O
had O
she O
determined O
to O
say O
pretty O
much O
at O
she O
did O
, O
if O
the O
occasion O
ever O
offered O
. O
146 S-CARDINAL
his O
love O
, O
was O
another O
anxious O
question O
. O
She O
wearied O
herself O
with O
proposing O
plans O
, O
and O
rejecting O
them O
. O
She O
was O
roused O
to O
a O
consciousness O
of O
time O
, O
by O
hearing O
the O
neighbouring O
church O
clock O
strike O
twelve S-CARDINAL
. O
Her O
father O
she O
knew O
might O
be O
expected O
home O
any O
minute O
, O
and O
she O
was O
in O
no O
mood O
for O
a O
meeting O
with O
him O
. O
So O
she O
hastily O
gathered O
up O
her O
work O
, O
and O
went O
to O
her O
own O
little O
bed- O
room O
, O
leaving O
him O
to O
let O
himself O
in O
. O
She O
put O
out O
her O
candle O
, O
that O
her O
father O
might O
not O
see O
its O
light O
under O
the O
door O
| | O
and O
sat O
down O
on O
her O
bed O
to O
think O
. O
But O
again O
turning O
things O
over O
in O
her O
mind O
again O
and O
again O
, O
she O
could O
only O
determine O
at O
once O
to O
put O
an O
end O
to O
all O
further O
com- O
munication O
with O
Mr. O
Carsons S-PERSON
, O
in O
the O
most O
decided O
way O
she O
could O
. O
Maidenly O
modesty O
( O
and O
true O
love O
is O
ever O
modest O
) O
seemed O
to O
oppose O
every O
plan O
she O
could O
think O
of O
, O
for O
showing O
Jem S-PERSON
how O
much O
she O
repented O
her O
decision O
against O
him O
, O
and O
how O
dearly O
she O
had O
now O
discovered O
that O
she O
loved O
him O
. O
She O
came O
to O
the O
unusual O
wisdom O
of O
resolving O
to O
do O
nothing O
, O
but O
strive O
to O
be O
patient O
, O
and O
improve O
circumstances O
as O
they O
might O
turnup O
. O
Surely O
, O
if O
Jem S-PERSON
knew O
of O
her O
remaining O
unmarried O
, O
he O
vould O
try O
his O
fortune O
again O
. O
He O
would O
never O
be O
content O
with O
one S-CARDINAL
rejection O
| | O
she O
believed O
she O
could O
not O
in O
his O
place O
. O
She O
had O
been O
very O
wrong O
, O
but O
now O
she O
would O
endeavour O
to O
do O
right O
, O
and O
have O
womanly O
patience O
, O
until O
he O
saw O
her O
changed O
and O
repentant O
mind O
in O
her O
natural O
actions O
. O
Even O
if O
she O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
years S-DATE
, O
it O
was O
no O
more O
than O
now O
it O
was O
easy O
to O
look O
forward O
to O
, O
as O
a O
penance O
for O
her O
giddy O
flirting O
on O
the O
one S-CARDINAL
hand O
, O
and O
her O
cruel O
mistake O
concerning O
her O
feelings O
on O
the O
other O
. O
So O
anticipating O
a O
happy O
ending O
to O
the O
course O
of O
her O
love O
, O
how- O
ever O
distant O
it O
might O
be O
, O
she O
fell O
asleep O
just O
as O
the O
earliest O
factory O
bells O
were O
ringing O
. O
She O
had O
sunk O
down O
in O
her O
clothes O
, O
and O
her O
sleep O
was O
unrefreshing O
. O
She O
wakened O
up O
shivery O
and O
chill O
in O
body O
, O
and O
sorrow O
- O
stricken O
in O
mind O
, O
though O
she O
could O
not O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
rightly O
tell O
the O
cause O
of O
her O
depression O
. O
She O
recalled O
the O
events O
of O
the O
night O
before O
, O
and O
still O
resolved O
to O
adhere O
to O
those O
determinations O
she O
had O
then O
148 S-CARDINAL
on O
her O
road O
, O
and O
she O
arrived O
at O
home O
, O
which O
she O
found O
as O
she O
expected O
, O
empty O
| | O
for O
she O
knew O
it O
was O
a O
club O
night O
, O
which O
her O
father O
would O
not O
miss O
. O
She O
sat O
down O
to O
recover O
breath O
, O
and O
to O
still O
her O
heart O
, O
which O
panted O
more O
from O
nervousness O
than O
from O
over O
- O
exertion O
, O
although O
she O
had O
walked O
so O
quickly O
. O
‘ O
Then O
she O
arose O
, O
and O
taking O
off O
her O
bonnet O
, O
her O
eye O
caught O
the O
form O
of O
Sally B-PERSON

passing O
the O
window O
with O
a O
linger O

looking O
into O
the O

all O
her O
might O
as O
, O
if O

ascertain O
if O
Mary S-PERSON

returned O
. O
In O
an O
instant O
she O
re- O
passed O
and O
knocked O
at O
the O
house O
- O
door O

but O
without O
awaiting O
an O
answer O
, O
she O
entered O

“ O
Well O

dear O
, O
” O
( O
knowing O
well O
how O
little O
“ O

Mary S-PERSON
considered O
her O
just O
then O
) O

“ O
it's O

“ O

in O
no O

“ O
Ay O

looking O
round O
as O

out O

shortly O

busying O
her- O

at O

about O
the O

“ O

But O
it O
was O
something O

Alice’s S-PERSON
joy O
at O
once O

her O

the O

down O

with O

bent O

down O

could O

from O
the O

heart O
sank O
within O
her O

at O
the O
remembrance O

his O
fierce O
re- O
pulsing O
action O

far O
fiercer O

seemed O
worse O
than O
death O
to O
reveal O
her O
condition O

else O
she O
sometimes O
thought O
that O
this O
course O
would O
be O
the O
most O
terrible O
, O
the O
most O

warning O

She O
must O
speak O

to O
that O

was O
soul- O

to O
whom O

may O
easily O
imagine O
that O
a O
double O

considered O
hardly O

worked O

monotonous O

which O
now O
in O
retrospection O

unclouded O

, O
she O
had O
, O
as O

known O

a O

talking O

both O
father O

son O

her O

shed O
unregarded O

unvalued O
tears O

casually O
told O

of O

sudden O

It O

at O

mourned O
little O
over O
his O

day O
by O

he O
became O
aware O
that O
the O

so O
day O

nearer O

came O
the O
diseased O

Mary S-PERSON
had O
a O
very O
decided O
opinion O
of O
her O
own O
on O
the O
subject O
, O
but O
she O
did O
not O
feel O
as O
if O
she O
had O
any O
right O
to O
give O
it O
. O
So O
she O
said O
— O
“ O
You O
must O
ask O

not O
me O

His O
countenance O
fell O

“ O

I O
should O
say O

that O
was O
a O
good O

no O
right O

I O
would O
not O
leave O
her O
now O
with O

out O

” O
“ O
No O

I O

I’ve O
been O
in O

them O
good O

and O
my O
voice O
stuck O
in O
my O
throat O
. O
Icould O
say O
nought O
of O
what O
I O
’d O
planned O
to O
say O

and O
I O
never O
thought O
of O
being O

bold O
as O
to O
offer O
her O
marriage O
till O
I’d O
been O
my O

been O

218 S-CARDINAL

But O
no O

Job O
seemed O
imperturbable O

So O
much O
the O
better O
, O

perhaps O
she O
could O
cover O
her O

rudeness O

her O

the O

either O

with O
nervous O

Mrs. O

came O
down O
herself O

Mr. O

Presently O
Mrs. O

hysterical O
cries O
were O
heard O
all O
over O
the O

shuddered O
at O
the O
outward O
expression O
of O
the O
agony O

was O
rending O
his O
heart O

Nobody O
thought O
of O

‘ O
The O

out O

time O
afterwards O
, O
three S-CARDINAL
policemen O
went O
to O
the O
works O
at O
which O
Jem S-PERSON
was O
foreman O
, O
and O
announced O
their O
errand O
to O
the O
astonished O
overseer O
, O
who O
directed O
them O
to O
the O
part O
of O
the O
foundry O
where O
Jem S-PERSON
was O
then O
superintend O

Dark O

were O
the O
walls O

the O

, O
the O
faces O
around O
them O

as O
they O
crossed O
the O

But O
, O
in O
the O

a O
deep O

lurid O
red O
glared O
over O
all O

the O
furnace O
roared O
with O
mighty O
flame O
. O
The O
men O
, O
like O
demons O
, O
in O
their O
fire O
- O
and O
- O
soot O
colouring O
, O
stood O
swart O
around O
, O
awaiting O
the O
moment O
when O
the O
tons O
of O
solid O
iron O
should O
have O
melted O
down O
into O
fiery O
liquid O
, O
fit O
to O

poured O
, O
with O
still O

heavy O
sound O
, O
into O
the O
delicate O
moulding O
of O
fine O
black O
sand O
, O
prepared O
to O
receive O
it O
. O
The O
heat O
was O
intense O
, O
and O
the O
red O
glare O
grew O
every O
instant O
more O
fierce O

the O
policemen O
stood O
awed O
with O
the O
novel O
sight O
. O
‘ O
Then O
, O
black O
figures O
, O
holding O
strange O
- O
shaped O
bucket O
shovels O
, O
came O
athwart O
the O
deep O

red O
furnace O
light O
, O
and O
clear O
and O
brilliant O
flowed O
forth O
the O
iron O
into O
the O
appropriate O
mould O
. O
The O
buzz O
of O
voices O
rose O
again O

there O
was O
time O
to O
speak O
, O
and O
gasp O
, O
and O
wipe O
the O
brows O

and O
then O
, O
one S-CARDINAL
by O

dispersed O
to O
some O

No O

B. O

, O
pointed O
out O
Jem S-PERSON
as O
the O
man O
he O
had O
seen O
engaged O
248 S-CARDINAL
from O
the O

to O
the O

door O
atmosphere O
, O
seemed O
to O
alter O
the O
current O
of O
her O
thoughts O
. O
She O
thought O
less O
of O
the O
dreadful O
subject O
which O
had O
so O
haunted O
her O
all O
day O
| | O
she O
cared O
less O
for O
the O
upbraiding O
speeches O
of O
her O
fellow O
- O
workwomen O
| | O
the O
old O
associa- O
tion O
of O
comfort O
and O
sympathy O
received O
from O
Alice S-PERSON
gave O
her O
the O
idea O
that O
, O
even O
now O
, O
her O
bodily O
presence O
would O
soothe O
and O
com- O
pose O
those O
who O
were O
in O
trouble O
, O
changed O
, O
unconscious O
, O
and O
absent O
though O
her O
spirit O
might O
be O
. O
‘ O
Then O
, O
again O
, O
she O
reproached O
herself O
a O
little O
for O
the O
feeling O
of O
pleasure O
she O
experienced O
, O
in O
thinking O
that O
he O
whom O
she O
dreaded O
could O
never O
more O
beset O
her O
path O
| | O
inthe O
security O
with O
which O
she O
could O
pass O
each O
street O
corner O
— O
each O
shop O
, O
where O
he O
used O
to O
lie O
in O
ambush O
. O
Oh O
! O
beating O
heart O
! O
was O
there O
no O
other O
little O
thought O
of O
joy O
lurking O
within O
, O
to O
gladden O
the O
very O
air O
without O
? O
Was O
she O
not O
going O
to O
meet O
, O
to O
see O
, O
to O
hear O
Jem S-PERSON

and O
could O
they O
fail O
at O
last O
to O
understand O
each O
other’s O
loving O
hearts O
! O
She O
softly O
lifted O
the O
latch O
, O
with O
the O
privilege O
of O
friendship O
. O
He O
was O
not O
there O
, O
but O
his O
mother O
was O
standing O
by O
the O
fire O
, O
stirring O
some O
little O
mess O
or O
other O
. O
Never O
mind O
! O
he O
would O
come O
soon O
: O
and O
with O
an O
unmixed O
desire O
to O
do O
her O
graceful O
duty O
to O
all O
belong O
- O
ing O
to O
him O
, O
she O
stepped O
lightly O
forwards O
, O
unheard O
by O
the O
old O
lady O
, O
who O
was O
partly O
occupied O
by O
the O
simmering O
, O
bubbling O
sound O
of O
her O
bit O
of O
cookery O
| | O
but O
more O
with O
her O
own O
sad O
thoughts O
, O
~ O
and O
wailing O
, O
half S-CARDINAL
- O
uttered O
murmurings O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
took O
off O
bonnet O
and O
shawl O
with O
speed O
, O
and O
advancing O
, O
made O
Mrs. O
Wilson S-PERSON
conscious O
of O
her O
presence O
, O
by O
saying O
, O
“ O
Let O
me O
do O
that O
for O
you O
. O
I’m O
sure O
you O
mun O
be O
tired O
. O
” O
Mrs. O
Wilson S-PERSON
slowly O
turned O
round O
, O
and O
her O
eyes O
gleamed O
like O
those O
of O
'a O
pent O
- O
up O
wild O
beast O
, O
as O
she O
recognised O
her O
visitor O
. O
“ O
And O
is O
it O
thee O
that O
dares O
set O
foot O
in O
this O
house O
, O
after O
what O
has O
come O
to O
pass O
? O
Is O
it O
not O
enotigh O
to O
have O
robbed O
me O
of O
my O
boy O
with O
thy O
arts O
and O
thy O
profligacy O
, O
but O
thou O
must O
come O
here O
to O
crow O
over O
me O
— O
me O
— O
his O
mother O

Dost O

Dost O

where O
Jem S-PERSON
is O
, O
all O
through O
thee O
? O
” O
‘ O
No O
! O
” O
quivered O
out O
poor O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
scarcely O
conscious O
that O
she O
252 S-CARDINAL
on O
the O
long O
curled O
eye O
- O
lashes O
. O
With O
his O
soft O
voice O
, O
and O
pleading O
looks O
, O
he O
uttered O
, O
in O
his O
pretty O
broken O
English S-LANGUAGE
, O
the O
word O
“ O
Hungry O
! O
so O
hungry O
. O
” O
And O
, O
as O
if O
to O
aid O
by O
gesture O
the O
effect O
of O
the O
solitary O
word O
, O
he O
pointed O
to O
his O
mouth O
, O
with O
its O
white O
quivering O
lips O
. O
‘ O
Mary S-PERSON
answered O
him O
impatiently O
, O
“ O
Oh O
, O
lad O
, O
hunger O
is O
nothing O
— O
nothing O
! O
” O
And O
she O
rapidly O
passed O
on O
. O
But O
her O
heart O
upbraided O
her O
the O
next O
minute O
with O
her O
unrelenting O
speech O
, O
and O
she O
hastily O
entered O
her O
door O
and O
seized O
the O
scanty O
remnant O
of O
food O
which O
the O
cup- O
board O
contained O
, O
and O
she O
retraced O
her O
steps O
to O
the O
place O
where O
the O
little O
hopeless O
stranger O
had O
sunk O
down O
by O
his O
mute O
compa- O
nion O
in O
loneliness O
and O
starvation O
, O
and O
was O
raining O
down O
tears O
as O
he O
spoke O
in O
some O
foreign O
tongue O
, O
with O
low O
cries O
for O
the O
far O
distant O
“ O
Mamma O
mia O
! O
” O
With O
the O
elasticity O
of O
heart O
belonging O
to O
childhood O
he O
sprang O
up O
as O
he O
saw O
the O
food O
the O
girl O
brought O
| | O
she O
whose O
face O
, O
lovely O
in O
its O
woe O
, O
had O
tempted O
him O
first S-ORDINAL
to O
address O
her O
| | O
and O
, O
with O
the O
graceful O
courtesy O
of O
his O
country O
, O
he O
looked O
up O
and O
smiled O
while O
he O
kissed O
her O
hand O
, O
and O
then O
poured O
forth O
his O
thanks O
, O
and O
shared O
her O
bounty O
with O
his O
little O
pet O
companion O
. O
She O
stood O
an O
instant O
, O
diverted O
from O
the O
thought O
of O
her O
own O
grief O
by O
the O
sight O
of O
his O
infantine O
gladness O
| | O
and O
then O
bending O
down O
and O
kissing O
his O
smooth O
forehead O
, O
she O
left O
him O
, O
and O
sought O
to O
be O
alone O
with O
her O
agony O
once O
more O
. O
She O
re-entered O
the O
house O
, O
locked O
the O
door O
, O
and O
tore O
off O
her O
bonnet O
, O
as O
if O
greedy O
of O
every O
moment O
which O
took O
her O
from O
the O
full O
indulgence O
of O
painful O
, O
despairing O
thought O
. O
Then O
she O
threw O
herself O
on O
the O
ground O
, O
yes O
, O
on O
the O
hard O
flags O
she O
threw O
her O
soft O
limbs O
down O
| | O
and O
the O
comb O
fell O
out O
of O
her O
hair O
, O
and O
those O
bright O
tresses O
swept O
the O
dusty O
floor O
, O
while O
she O
pillowed O
and O
hid O
her O
face O
on O
her O
arms O
, O
and O
burst O
forth O
into O
hard O
, O
suffocating O
sobs O
. O
Oh O
, O
earth O
! O
thou O
didst O
seem O
but O
a O
dreary O
dwelling O
- O
place O
for O
thy O
poor O
child O
that O
night O
. O
None O
to O
comfort O
, O
none O
to O
pity O
! O
And O
self O
- O
reproach O
gnawing O
at O
her O
heart O
. O
Oh O
, O
why O
did O
she O
ever O
listen O
to O
the O
tempter O
? O
Why O
did O
she O
ever O
give O
ear O
to O
her O
own O
suggestions O
, O
and O
cravings O
after O
wealth O
253 S-CARDINAL
and O
grandeur O
? O
Why O
had O
she O
thought O
it O
a O
fine O
thing O
to O
have O
a O
rich O
lover O
? O
She O
— O
she O
had O
deserved O
it O
all O
| | O
but O
he O
was O
the O
victim O
, O
— O
he O
the O
beloved O
. O
She O
could O
not O
conjecture O
, O
she O
could O
not O
even O
pause O
to O
think O
who O
had O
revealed O
, O
or O
how O
he O
had O
discovered O
her O
acquaintance O
with O
Harry B-PERSON
Carsons E-PERSON
. O
It O
was O
but O
too O
clear O
, O
some O
way O
or O
another O
, O
he O
had O
learnt O
all O
| | O
and O
what O
would O
he O
think O
ofher O
? O
No O
hope O
of O
his O
love O
, O
— O
oh O
, O
that O
she O
would O
give O
up O
, O
and O
be O
content O
| | O
it O
was O
his O
life O
, O
his O
precious O
life O
, O
that O
was O
threatened O
? O
‘ O
Then O
she O
tried O
to O
recall O
the O
particulars O
, O
which O
, O
when O
Mrs. O
Wil- S-PERSON
son O
had O
given O
them O
, O
had O
fallen O
but O
upon O
a O
deafened O
ear O
, O
— O
something O
about O
a O
gun O
, O
a O
quarrel O
, O
which O
she O
could O
not O
remember O
clearly O
. O
Oh O
, O
how O
terrible O
to O
think O
of O
his O
crime O
, O
his O
blood O
- O
guiltiness O
| | O
he O
who O
had O
hitherto O
been O
so O
good O
, O
so O
noble O
, O
and O
now O
an O
assassin O
! O
And O
then O
she O
shrank O
from O
him O
in O
thought O
| | O
and O
then O
, O
with O
bitter O
remorse O
, O
clung O
more O
closely O
to O
his O
image O
with O
passionate O
self O
- O
upbraiding O
. O
Was O
it O
not O
she O
who O
had O
led O
him O
to O
the O
pit O
into O
which O
he O
had O
fallen O
? O
Was O
she O
toblamehim O
? O
She O
to O
judge O
him O
? O
Who O
could O
tell O
how O
maddened O
he O
might O
have O
been O
by O
jealousy O
| | O
how O
one S-CARDINAL
moment's O
uncontrollable O
passion O
might O
have O
led O
him O
to O
become O
a O
murderer O
! O
And O
she O
had O
blamed O
him O
in O
her O
heart O
after O
his O
last O
deprecating O
, O
imploring O
, O
prophetic O
speech O
! O
‘ O
Then O
she O
burst O
out O
crying O
afresh O
| | O
and O
when O
weary O
of O
crying O
, O
fell O
to O
thinking O
again O
. O
The O
gallows O
! O
The O
gallows O
! O
Black O
it O
stood O
against O
the O
burning O
light O
which O
dazzled O
her O
shut O
eyes O
, O
press O
on O
them O
as O
she O
would O
. O
Oh O
! O
she O
was O
going O
mad O
| | O
and O
for O
awhile O
she O
lay O
outwardly O
still O
, O
but O
with O
the O
pulses O
careering O
through O
her O
head O
with O
wild O
vehemence O
. O
‘ O
And O
then O
came O
a O
strange O
forgetfulness O
of O
the O
present O
, O
in O
thought O
of O
the O
long O
- O
past O
times O
| | O
— O
of O
those O
days O
when O
she O
hid O
her O
face O
on O
her O
mother’s O
pitying O
, O
loving O
bosom O
, O
and O
heard O
tender O
words O
of O
comfort O
, O
be O

of O

the O

had O
that O
evening O

something O
to O

thought O
about O

mourned O
over O

— O
when O
Jem S-PERSON

she O
had O
played O
together O

he O
, O
with O
the O
condescen O

waiting O
for O
his O
victim O

There O
was O
no O

however O
, O
that O
any O
one O
had O
been O
about O
the O

Ifthe O
grass O
had O
been O
bruised O
or O
bent O
where O
he O
had O
trod O
, O
it O
had O
had O
enough O

elasticity O
of O
life O
to O
raise O
itself O
under O
the O
dewy O
influences O
of O
night O
. O
She O
hushed O
her O
breath O
in O
involuntary O
awe O
, O
but O
nothing O
else O
told O
of O
the O
violent O
, O
deed O
by O
which O
a O
fellow O
- O
creature O
had O
passed O
away O
. O
She O
stood O
still O
for O
a B-TIME
minute E-TIME
, O
imagining O
to O
herself O
the O
position O
of O

guided O
by O
the O
only O
circumstance O

the O

on O

Suddenly O
( O
it O
was O
before O
the O
sun O
had O
risen O
above O
the O
horizon O
) O
she O
became O
aware O
of O
something O
white O
in O
the O
hedge O

All O
other O
colours O
wore O
the O

hue O
, O
though O
the O
forms O
of O
objects O
were O
perfectly O

What O
was O
it O
? O
It O

late O
in O
one S-CARDINAL

the O

of O
the O

She O
stepped O
forwards O
to O
examine O
. O
It O
proved O
to O
be O
alittle O
piece O
of O
stiff O
writin O
, O
paper O
compressed O
into O
a O
round O

She O
understood O
it O
in- O
stantly O

it O
was O
the O
paper O
that O
had O
served O
as O
wadding O
for O
the O
murderer's O
gun O

Then O
she O
had O
been O
standing O
just O
where O
the O
murderer O
must O
have O
been O
but O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
hours E-TIME
before O

probably O
( O
as O
the O
rumour O
had O
spread O
through O
the O

reaching O
her O
ears O
) O
one O
of O
the O
poor O
maddened O
turn O
- O
outs O
, O
who O
hung O
about O
everywhere O
, O
with O
black O
, O
fierce O
looks O
, O
as O
if O
contemplatiug O
some O
deed O
of O
violence O

Her O
sympathy O
was O
all O
with O
them O
, O
for O
she O
had O
known O
what O
they O
suffered O

and O
besides O
this O
there O
was O
her O
own O
individual O
dislike O
of O
Mr. O

dread O

him O

Yet O
, O
poor O
Mary S-PERSON
! O
Death O
was O
terrible O
, O
though O
sure O
, O
remedy O
for O
the O

Esther S-PERSON

dreaded O

how O

she O
stand O
the O

loving O

believed O
her O

Poor O
Mary S-PERSON
! O
who O
would O
comfort O
her O
? O
Esther's S-PERSON
thoughts O
began O
to O
picture O
her O
sor- O
row O
, O
her O
despair O
, O
when O
the O
news O
of O
her O

death O
should O
reach O
her O

she O
longed O

keener O

Bright O

beautiful O
came O
the O
slanting O

of O
thé O

It O
was O
time O
for O
such O

she O
to O
hide O
themselves O
, O
, O
with O

the O
other O
obscene O

of O
night O

from O
the O
glorious O
light O
of O
day O

which O
was O
only O
for O
the O

So O
she O
turned O
her O
steps O
towards O
town O
, O
still O
holding O
the O

But O
in O

over O
the O

- O
262 S-CARDINAL
She O
had O
longed O
to O
open O
her O
wretched O
, O
wretched O
heart O
, O
so O
hopeless O
, O
so O
abandoned O
by O
all O
living O

to O
one O
who O
had O
loved O
her O
once O

yet O
she O
refrained O

from O
dread O
of O
the O

the O
altered O

the O

She O

She O
could O
not O

The O

Esther S-PERSON

Esther S-PERSON
herself O

I O

proprieties O
of O
her O
sex O
, O
and O
capable O
of O
gross O
duplicity O
, O
in O
speaking O
of O
one S-CARDINAL
lover O
as O
she O
had O
done O
of O
Jem S-PERSON
, O
while O
she O
was O
encouraging O
another O
in O
attentions O
, O
at O
best O
of O
a O
very O
doubtful O
character O

But O
now O
Margaret S-PERSON
was O
drawn O
into O
the O
conversation O
. O
Sud- O
denly O
it O
flashed O
across O
Mary's S-PERSON
mind O
, O
that O
the O
night O
of O
the O
murder O
was O
the O
very O
night O
, O
or O
rather O
the B-TIME
same I-TIME
early I-TIME
morning E-TIME
, O
that O
Margaret S-PERSON
had O
been O
with O
Alice S-PERSON
. O
She O
turned O
sharp O
round O
, O
with O
— O
“ O
Ob O
! O
Margaret S-PERSON
, O
you O
can O
tell O
me O

you O
were O
there O
when O
he O
came O
back O

night O

were O
you O
not O

No O

you O
were O
not O

but O
you O
were O
there O
not O
many O
hours O
after O
. O
Did O
not O
you O
hear O
where O
hhe’d O
been O
? O
He O
was O
away O
the O
night O
before O
, O
too O
, O
when O
Alice S-PERSON
was O
first S-ORDINAL
taken O

when O
you O
were O
there O
for O
your O
tea O

Oh O

where O
was O
he O
, O
Margaret S-PERSON
? O
” O
“ O
I O
don’t O
know O
, O
” O
she O
answered O
. O
“ O
Stay O

I O
do O
remember O
something O

his O

I O
can’t O
justly O

what O
it O
was O

“ O
Tl O
go O
to O
his O
mother’s O
, O
” O
said O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
resolutely O
. O
They O
neither O
of O
them O
spoke O
, O
either O
to O
advise O
or O
dissuade O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
felt O
she O
had O
no O
sympathy O
from O
them O
, O
and O
braced O
up O
her O
soul O
to O
act O
without O
such O
loving O
aid O
of O
friendship O
. O
She O
knew O
that O
their O
advice O
would O
be O
willingly O
given O
at O
her O
demand O
, O
and O
that O
was O
all O
she O
really O
required O
for O
Jem’s S-PERSON
sake O
. O
Still O
her O
courage O
failed O
a O
little O
as O
she O
walked O
to O
Jane B-PERSON
Wilson’s E-PERSON
, O
alone O
in O
the O
world O
with O
her O
secret O
. O
Jane B-PERSON
Wilson’s E-PERSON
eyes O
were O
swelled O
with O
crying O

and O
it O
was O
sad O
to O
see O
the O
ravages O
which O
intense O
anxiety O
and O
sorrow O
had O
made O
on O
her O
appearance O
in O
four B-TIME

twenty I-TIME
hours E-TIME
. O
All O
night O
long O
she O
’ O
and O
Mrs. O
Davenport S-PERSON
had O
crooned O
over O
their O
sorrows O
, O
always O
recurring O
, O
like O
the O
burden O
of O
an O
old O
song O
, O
to O
the O
dreadest O
sorrow O
of O
all O
, O
which O
was O
now O
impending O
over O
Mrs. O
Wilson S-PERSON

She O
had O
grown O
— O
I O
hardly O
know O
what O
word O
to O
use O
— O
but O
, O
something O
like O
proud O
of O
her O
martyrdom O

she O
had O
grown O
to O
hug O
her O
grief O

to O
feel O
an O
, O
excitement O
in O
her O
agony O
of O

She O
fell O
to O
sobbing O

in O
the O
convulsive O
breath O
- O
catching O
manner O
which O
tells O

interrupted O
Mrs. O
Wilson S-PERSON
, O
half O
- O
irritated O
at O
the O
light O
way O
, O
as O
she O
considered O
it O
, O
in O
which O
Mary S-PERSON
spoke O

and O
a O
little O
displeased O
that O
another O
could O
hope O
when O
she O
had O
almost O
brought O
herself O
to O
find O
pleasure O

“ O

” O
She O
was O
too O
weak O
to O
be O
angry O
long O

her O
wrath O
sank O
away O
to O
feeble O
sobbing O
and O
worn O
- O
out O
moans O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
was O
most O
anxious O
to O
soothe O
her O
from O
any O
violence O
of O
either O
grief O
or O
anger O
| | O
she O
did O
so O
want O
her O
to O
be O
clear O
in O
her O
recollection O

and O
, O
besides O
, O
her O
tenderness O
was O
great O
towards O
Jem's S-PERSON
mother O
. O
So O
she O
spoke O
in O
a O
low O
gentle O
tone O
the O
loving O
entences O
, O
which O
sound O
so O
broken O
and O
powerless O
in O
repetition O
276 S-CARDINAL
She O
looked O
so O
piteously O
in O
Mary’s O
face O
with O
her O
miserable O
eyes O
, O
that O
Mary S-PERSON
felt O
her O
heart O
giving O
way O
, O
and O
, O
dreading O
the O
weakness O
of O
her O
powers O
, O
which O
the O
burst O
of O
crying O
she O
longed O
for O
would O
occasion O
, O
hastily O
changed O
the O
subject O
to O
Alice S-PERSON

and O
Jane S-PERSON
, O
in O
her O
heart O
, O
feeling O
that O
there O
was O
no O
sorrow O
like O
a O
mother’s O
sorrow O

replied O
, O
“ O

th’ O

weaker O

Thou O
‘ O
It O
may O

” O
Mary S-PERSON
went O
up O
- O
stairs O
: O
partly O
because O
it O
is O
the O
etiquette O
in O
humble O
life O
, O
to O
offer O
to O
friends O
a O
last O
opportunity O
of O
seeing O
the O
dying O

the O
dead O
, O
while O
the O
same O
etiquette O
forbids O
a O
refusal O
of O
the O
invitation O

and O
partly O
because O
she O
longed O
to O
breathe O
, O
for O
an O
instant O
, O
the O
atmosphere O
of O
holy O
calm O
, O
which O
seemed O
ever O
to O
surround O
the O
pious O
good O
old O
woman O

Alice S-PERSON
lay O
, O
as O
before O
, O
without O
pain O
, O
or O
at O
least O
any O
outward O
expression O
of O
it O

but O
totally O
unconscious O
of O
all O
present O
circumstances O
, O
and O
absorbed O
in O
recollections O
of O
the O
days O
of O
her O
girlhood O
, O
which O
were O
vivid O
enough O
to O
take O
the O
place O
of O
reality O
to O
her O
. O
Still O
she O
talked O
of O
green O
fields O
, O
and O
still O
she O
spoke O
to O
the O
long O
- O
dead O
mother O
and O
sister O
, O
low O
- O
lying O
in O
their O
graves O
this O
many O
a O
year O
, O
as O
if O
they O
were O
with O
her O

about O
her O
, O
in O
the O
pleasant O
places O
where O
her O
youth O
had O
passed O
. O
But O
the O
voice O
was O
fainter O
, O
the O
motions O
were O
more O
languid O

she O
was O
evidently O
passing O
away O

but O
how O
happily O
! O
Mary S-PERSON
stood O
for O
a O
time O
in O
silence O
, O
watching O
and O
listening O
. O
Then O
she O
bent O
down O
and O
reverently O
kissed O
Alice’s S-PERSON
cheek O

and O
drawing O
Jane B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
away O
from O
the O
bed O
, O
as O
if O
the O
spirit O
of O
her O
who O
lay O
there O
were O
yet O
cognizant O
of O

she O
whispered O
a O
few O
words O

the O

her O
over O

over O
again O
in O
a O
warm O

went O
a O

then O
once O
more O
came O
back O

up O

And O
when O
she O
had O
fairly O
left O
the O

Jane B-PERSON

felt O
as O

Yet O

ached O

the O

For O

“ O

” O
* O
that O

her O

at O

her O

any O
intelligence O

the O

‘ O
Then O

should O
she O
apply O
to O
Jem S-PERSON
himself O
! O
No O
! O
she O
knew O
him O
too O
well O

She O
felt O
how O
thoroughly O
he O
must O
ere O
now O
have O
had O
it O
his O
power O

exculpate O
himself O
at O
another’s O
expense O
. O
And O
hi O
: O
tacit O
refusal O
so O
to O
do O
had O
assured O
her O
of O
what O
she O
had O
never O
doubted O
, O
that O
the O
murderer O
. O
was O
safe O
from O
any O
impeachment O
of O
his O
. O
But O
then O
neither O
would O
he O
consent O

she O
feared O

to O
any O
steps O
which O
might O
tend O
to O
proving O
himself O
innocent O

At O
any O
rate O
, O
she O
could O
not O
consult O
him O

He O
was O
removed O

Already O
it O
was O

And O
even O
if O

I O
believe O
she O
would O

Mary S-PERSON
offered O
no O

at O

quietly O

sadly O

All O

suddenly O

perhaps O
she O
was O
too O
depressed O
in O
body O

told O

home O

Oh O
! O
how O
her O
head O
did O
ache O
, O
and O
how O
dizzy O
her O
brain O
was O
growing O
! O
But O
there O
would O
be O
time O
enough O
she O
felt O
for O
giving O
way O
, O
hereafter O
. O
So O
she O
sat O
quiet O
and O
still O
by O
an O
effort O

sitting O
near O
the O
window O
, O

looking O
out O
of O
it O
, O

seeing O
nothing O
, O
when O
all O
at O
once O
she O
caught O
sight O
of O
something O
which O
roused O
her O
up O
, O
and O
made O
her O
draw O
back O

it O
was O
too O
late O

She O
had O
been O
seen O

flaunted O
into O
the O
little O
dingy O

making O
it O
gaudy O
with O
the O
Sunday S-DATE
excess O
of O
colouring O
in O
her O
dress O
. O
She O
was O
really O
curious O
to O
see O
Mary S-PERSON

her O
connexion O
with O
murderer O
seemed O
to O
have O
made O
her O
into O
a O
sort O
of O
/ O
usus O
nature O
, O
and O
was O
almost O
, O
by O
some O
, O
expected O
to O
have O
made O
a O
change O
in O
her O
personal O
appearance O
, O
so O
earnestly O
did O
they O
stare O
at O
her O
. O
But O
Mary S-PERSON

had O
been O
too O
much O
absorbed O

at O
the O

the O

was O
rather O
pleasant O

otherwise O

dearly O

the O

sure O

Once O
Mary S-PERSON
in O
her O
im O

patience O
had O
risen O
up O
to O
obtain O
a O
better O
view O
of O
the O
progress O
they O
had O
made O
, O
but O
the O
men O
had O
roughly O
told O
her O
to O
sit O
down O
imme- O
diately O
, O
and O
she O
had O
dropped O
on O
her O
seat O
like O
a O
chidden O
child O
, O
although O
the O
impatience O
was O
still O
at O
her O
heart O
. O
But O
now O
she O
grew O
sure O
they O
were O
turning O
off O
from O
the O
straight O
course O
which O
they O
had O
hitherto O
kept O
on O
the O
Cheshire S-GPE
side O
of O
the O
river O

whither O
they O
had O
gone O
to O
avoid O
the O
force O
of O
the O
current O
, O
and O
after O
a O
short O
time O
she O
could O
not O
help O
naming O
her O
conviction O
, O
as O
a O
kind O
of O
nightmare O
dread O
and O
belief O
came O
over O
her O
, O
that O
every O
thing O
animate O

inanimate O
was O
in O
league O
against O
her O

overtaking O

saw O

knew O

were O
desirous O
of O
obtaining O
his O

at O

“ O

“ O

told O
her O

gathered O
the O

out O
of O
the O

slang O

it O

Some O

the O

‘ O
The O

against O

independently O
of O

nautical O
lan- O

a O

beyond O

sank O
into O
a O
kind O
of O
stupor O

All O
outward O

harmonised O
with O
her O

“ O

, O
very O
little O

He O
barely O
answered O

he O
refused O

“ O

with O
an O
emphasis O
on O
the O
word O
, O
“ O
he O
gave O

that O

something O

what O

Mr. O

up O

con- O
tinued O
Job O

“ O
His O
words O
were O
few O
enough O

he O
was O
so O
reserved O

short O
, O
that O
as O
I O
said O

I O
can O
only O
give O
you O
the O
impression O

conveyed O

his O
face O
( O
sad O
enough O

I O
assure O

brightened O
a O
little O

he O
said O
he O
had O
nothing O
to O

no O
defence O

make O

Jasked S-PERSON
him O
if O
he O
was O
guilty O
, O
then O

and O
by O
way O
of O
opening O
his O
heart O
I O
said O
I O
understood O
he O
had O
had O
provocation O
enough O

inas- O
much O

J S-PERSON
heard O
that O

James B-PERSON

did O
not O
speak O
one S-CARDINAL

another O

Ithen S-PERSON
went O
to O
particulars O

Lasked O
him O
if O
the O

328 S-CARDINAL
There O
was O
a O
true O
bill O
against O
James B-PERSON

. O
Ofcourse O
. O
And O
yet O
Job S-PERSON
felt O
now O
doubly O
anxious O
and O
sad O
. O
It O
seemed O
the O
begin- O
ning O
of O
the O
end O
. O
He O
bad O
got O
, O
by O
imperceptible O
degrees O
, O
to O
think O
Jem S-PERSON
innocent O
. O
Little O
by O
little O
this O
persuasion O
had O
come O
upon O
him O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
( O
tossing O
about O

the O
little O
boat O
on O
the O
broad O
river O
) O
did O
not O
come O
, O
nor O
did O
Will S-PERSON
. O
Job O
grew O
very O
restless O
. O
He O
longed O
to O
go O
and O
watch O
for O
them O
out O
ofthe O
window O
, O
but O
feared O
to O
interrupt O
Mr. O
Bridgenorth S-PERSON
. O
At O
length O
his O
desire O
to O
look O
out O
was O
irresistible O
, O
and O
he O
got O
up O
and O
walked O
carefully O
and O
gently O
across O
the O
room O
, O
his O
boots O
creaking O
at O
every O
cautious O
step O
. O
The O
gloom O
which O
had O
overspread O
the O
sky O
, O
and O
the O
influence O
of O
which O
had O
been O
felt O
by O
Mary S-PERSON
on O
the O
open O
water O
, O
was O
yet O
more O
perceptible O
in O
the O
dark O
, O
dull O
street O
. O
Job O
grew O
more O
and O
more O
fidgety O
. O
He O
was O
obliged O
to O
walk O
about O
the O
room O
, O
for O
he O
could O
not O
keep O
still O
| | O
and O
he O
did O
so O
, O
regardless O
of O
Mr. O
Bridgenorth’s S-PERSON
impatient O
little O
motions O
and O
noises O
, O
asthe O
slow O
, O
stealthy O
, O
creaking O
movements O
were O
heard O
, O
backwards O
and O
forwards O
, O
behind O
his O
chair O
. O
He O
really O
liked O
Job O
, O
and O
was O
interested O
for O
Jem S-PERSON
, O
else O
his O
nervousness O
would O
have O
overcome O
his O
sympathy O
long O
before O
it O
did O
. O
But O
he O
could O
hold O
out O
no O
longer O
against O
the O
monotonous O
, O
grating O
sound O
| | O
so O
at O
last O
he O
threw O
down O
his O
pen O
, O
locked O
his O
portfolio O
, O
and O
taking O
up O
his O
hat O
and O
gloves O
, O
told O
Job O
he O
must O
go O
to O
the O
courts O
. O
“ O
But O
Will B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON

said O
Job S-PERSON

in O
dismay O

“ O

I O

fixed O
with O
this O
William B-PERSON

with O
the O

I'll S-PERSON

So O

The O

comical O

which O
met O
with O
no O
responsive O
look O
from O
the O
old O

naturally O

Presently O

grew O
tired O

gotup O

hung O
about O

low O
, O
but O
very O
calmly O
. O
« O
Ay O

” O
replied O
Job S-PERSON
, O
slipping O
out O
of O
the O
house O

He O
went O
first S-ORDINAL
to O
Mr. O
Bridgenorth’s S-PERSON
, O
where O
it O
had O
struck O
him O
that O

all O

Mr. O

had O
just O
. O
come O
in O
, O
and O
Job S-PERSON
went O
breathlessly O
up O

stairs O
to O
consult O
with O
him O
as O
to O
the O
state O
of O
the O
case O
. O
“ O
It’s O
. O
a O
bad O
job O
, O
” O
said O
the O
lawyer O
, O
looking O
very O
grave O
, O
while O
he O
arranged O
his O
papers O
. O
“ O
Johnson S-PERSON
told O
me O
how O
it O
was O

the O
woman O
that O
Wilson S-PERSON

with O

him O

I O
doubt O
it’s O
buta O
wild O
goose O
- O
chase O
of O
the O
girl O
Barton S-PERSON
. O
Our O
case O
must O
rest O
on O
the O
uncertainty O
of O
circumstantial O
evidence O
, O
and O
the O
goodness O
of O
the O
334 S-CARDINAL
given O
him O
, O
he O
went O
out O
into O
the O
street O

and O
there O
he O
stood O
still O
, O
to O
ponder O
over O
probabilities O

chances O
. O
After O
some O
little O
time O
he O
slowly O
turned O
towards O
the O
lodging O
where O
he O
had O
left O
Mrs. O
Wilson S-PERSON
. O
There O
was O
nothing O
else O
to O
be O
done O

but O
he O
loitered O
on O
the O
way O
, O
fervently O
hoping O
that O
her O
weariness O
and O
her O
woes O
might O
have O
sent O
her O
to O
sleep O
before O
his O
return O
, O
that O
he O
might O
be O
spared O
her O
questionings O
. O
He O
went O
very O
gently O
into O
the O
house O
- O
place O
where O
the O
sleepy O
landlady O
awaited O
his O
coming O

his O
bringing O
the O

to O
share O
the O
old O
woman’s O
bed O

But O
in O
her O
sleepy O
blindness O
she O
knocked O
things O
so O
about O
in O
lighting O
the O
candle O
( O
she O
could O
see O

she O
said O
) O
, O
that O
the O
voice O
of O

was O
heard O
from O
the O
little O
back O

she O
was O

pass O
the O
night O

“ O

” O
. O
Job O
gave O
no O
answer O

kept O
down O
his O
breath O
, O
that O

might O
think O
herself O
mistaken O

The O
landlady O
, O
having O
no O
such O
care O
, O
dropped O
the O
snuffers O
with O
a O
sharp O
metallic O
sound O
, O
and O
then O
, O
by O
her O
endless O
apologies O
, O
convinced O
the O
listening O
woman O
that O

“ O

“ O

said O

to O

“ O

again O

under O

roof O

among O
kind O
, O

rough O

She O
had O
offered O
no O

the O
old O

insure O
her O
following O
him O

as O
he O
threaded O
the O
crowded O
dock O

ways O
, O

dived O
up O
strange O
by- O
streets O

She O
came O
on O
meekly O
after O
him O

scarcely O
thinking O
in O
her O
stupor O

led O
her O
to O
an O
old O

pulled O

the O

roused O

perhaps O
the O

might O
help O

little O

too O

she O
felt O
awkwardness O
of O
accounting O
for O
her O
presence O
to O
a O
little O

moving O
about O

entrance O

boatman O
took O
it O
very O
quietly O

exclaimed O

as O

produced O
a O
square O
bottle O

gled O

labelled O

she O

as O
the O
dose O
he O
poured O
into O
Mary’s O
open O
mouth O

made O
her O
start O

wife O
helped O
Mary S-PERSON
to O
rise O

placed O
her O
in O

chair O

“ O
All’s O
right O

softly O
forth O

you O

he O
shook O
himself O

took O
his O
pipe O

went O
out O
without O
deigning O
another O
word O

leaving O
his O

Mary S-PERSON
watched O

turning O
her O
sorrowful O
eyes O

Mary S-PERSON
had O
listened O
feebly O
to O

broken O
sentences O

“ O

Your O

took O
me O
out O

recognised O
the O
unfavourable O
point O
at O

the O

giving O
a O
heavy O
sigh O

turned O
into O

began O

beat O
about O

“ O

Mary S-PERSON
did O
not O

it O

Mary S-PERSON
went O
up O

thanks O

blessings O
on O
those O
who O
took O
the O
stranger O
in O

Mrs. O
Sturgis S-PERSON

led O
her O

a O
little O
room O
redolent O
of O
the O
sea O

foreign O

the O
Baltic S-LOC

The O
sheets O
looked O
made O
out O

cloth O

were O
fresh O

clean O
in O

of O
their O
brownness O
. O
Against O
the O
wall O
were O
wafered O
two S-CARDINAL

drawings O

their O

underneath O

the O
mother’s O
eyes O
caught O
, O

gazed O
until O
they O
filled O
with O
tears O

she O
brushed O
the O
drops O
away O
with O
the O
back O
of O
her O
hand O

ina O
cheerful O
tone O
, O
went O
on O

assure O

down O

up O

pleaded O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
as O
her O
hostess O
seemed O
so O
resolute O
about O
seeing O
her O

Her O
looks O
won O
her O
suit O

down O

with O
the O
restless O
incessant O
tramp O
of O
a O
wild O

ina O

if O

compelled O
his O
aching O
limbs O

cease O
for O
an O
instant O
, O
the O
twitchings O
which O
ensued O
almost O
amounted O
to O
con- O
vulsions O

and O
he O
re-commenced O
his O
walk O
as O
the O
lesser O
evil O

the O
more O
bearable O
fatigue O

With O
daylight O
, O
increased O
power O
of O
action O
came O

drove O
off O

his O
attorney O

him O
with O
further O
directions O

‘ O
Job B-PERSON
Legh E-PERSON
had O
carefully O
avoided O
any O
questioning O
from O
Mrs. O

that O
morning O
. O
Indeed O
he O
had O
not O
been O
much O
in O
her O
com- O

for O
he O

risen O
up O
early O

go O
out O
once O
more O
to O
make O
in- O
quiry O
for O
Mary S-PERSON

and O
when O
he O
could O
hear O
nothing O
of O
her O
, O
he O
had O
desperately O
resolved O
not O
to O
undeceive O
Mrs. O
Wilson S-PERSON
, O
as O
sorrow O
* O
never O
came O
too O
late O

and O
if O
the O
blow O
were O
inevitable O

it O
would O
be O
better O
to O
leave O
her O
in O
ignorance O
of O
the O
impending O
evil O
as O
long O
as O
possible O
. O
She O
took O
her O
place O
in O
the O
witness O
- O
room O
, O
worn O
and O
dispirited O
, O
but O
not O
anxious O
. O
‘ O
As O
Job O
struggled O
through O
the O
crowd O
into O
thé O
body O
of O
the O
court O
, O
Mr. O
Bridgenorth’s S-PERSON
clerk O
beckoned O
to O
him O
. O
“ O
Here O
’s O
a O
letter O
for O
you O
from O
our O
client O

” O
Job O
sickened O
as O
he O
took O
it O
. O
He O
did O
not O
know O
why O
, O
but O
he O
dreaded O
a O
confession O
of O
guilt O
, O
which O
would O
be O
an O
overthrow O
of O
all O
hope O

The O
letter O
ran O
as O
follows O
: O
344 S-CARDINAL

turned O
the O
letter O
over O
and O
over O
when O
he O
had O
read O
it O

sighed O
deeply O

it O
carefully O
up O
in O
a O
bit O
of O
news O

had O
about O

it O

‘ O

off O

was O
an O
attitude O

strike O

his O
in O
- O
stant’s O
pause O
, O
and O
said O
in O
a O
low O
firm O
voice O
, O
346 S-CARDINAL
“ O
Clear O
as O
day O
against O
the O
prisoner O
, O
” O
whispered O
one S-CARDINAL
attorney's O
clerk O
to O
another O
. O
“ O
Black O
as O
night O
, O
you O
mean O
, O
” O
both O
smiled O
. O
“ O
Jane B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
! O
who’s O
she O
? O
some O
relation O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
from O
the O
name O

” O
“ O
The O
mother O
, O
— O
she O
that O
is O
to O
prove O
the O
gun-part O
of O
the O
case O
. O
” O
” O
“ O
Oh O
, O
ay O
— O
Iremember O
! O
Rather O
hard O
on O
her O
, O
too O
, O
I O
think O
. O
” O
Then O
both O
were O
silent O
, O
as O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
officers O
of O
the O
court O
ushered O
Mrs. O
Wilson S-PERSON
into O
the O
witness O
- O
box O
. O
I O
have O
often O
called O
her O
“ O
the O
old O
woman O
, O
” O
and O
“ O
an O
old O
woman O
, O
” O
because O
, O
in O
truth O
, O
her O
appearance O
was O
so O
much O
beyond O
her O
years O
, O
which O
could O
not O
be O
many O
above O
fifty S-CARDINAL
. O
But O
partly O
owing O
to O
her O
accident O
in O
early O
life O
, O
which O
left O
a O
stamp O
of O
pain O
upon O
her O
face O
, O
partly O
owing O
to O
her O
anxious O
temper O
, O
partly O
to O
her O
sorrows O
, O
and O
partly O
to O
her O
limping O
gait O
, O
she O
always O
gave O
me O
the O
idea O
of O
age O
. O
Butnow O
she O
might O
have O
seemed O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
seventy E-CARDINAL
| | O
her O
lines O
were O
so O
set O
and O
deep O
, O
her O
features O
so O
sharpened O
, O
and O
her O
walk O
so O
feeble O
. O
She O
was O
trying O
to O
check O
her O
sobs O
into O
composure O
, O
and O
( O
unconsciously O
) O
was O
striving O
to O
behave O
as O
she O
thought O
would O
best O
please O
her O
poor O
boy O
, O
whom O
she O
knew O
she O
had O
often O
grieved O
by O
her O
uncontrolled O
impa- O
tience O
. O
He O
had O
buried O
his O
face O
in O
his O
arms O
, O
which O
rested O
on O
the O
front O
of O
the O
dock O
( O
an O
attitude O
he O
retained O
during O
the O
greater O
part O
of O
his O
trial O
, O
and O
which O
prejudiced O
many O
against O
him O
) O
. O
‘ O
The O
counsel O
began O
the O
examination O
. O
“ O
Your O
name O
is O
Jane B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
, O
I O
believe O

” O
“ O
Yes O

” O
« O
The O
mother O
of O

prisoner O
at O
the O
bar O

” O
“ O
Yes O
, O
Sir O
, O
” O
with O
quivering O
voice O
, O
ready O
to O
break O
out O
into O
weeping O
, O
but O
earning O
respect O
by O
the O
strong O
effort O
at O
self O
- O
control O
, O
prompted O
, O
as O
I O
have O
said O
before O
, O
by O
her O
earnest O
wish O
to O
please O
her O
son O
by O
her O
behaviour O
. O
The O
barrister O
now O
proceeded O
to O
the O
important O
part O
of O
the O
ex- O
amination O
, O
tending O
to O
prove O
that O
the O
gun O
found O
on O
the O
scene O
of O
the O
murder O
was O
the O
prisoner’s O
. O
She O
had O
committed O
herself O
so O
fully O
to O
the O
policeman O
, O
that O
she O
could O
not O
well O
retract O
| | O
so O
without O
much O
delay O
in O
bringing O
the O
question O
round O
to O
the O
desired O
point O
, O
the O
gun O
was O
produced O
in O
court O
, O
and O
the O
inquiry O
made O
— O
. O
replied O
his O
friend O
| | O
and O
they O
348 S-CARDINAL
and O
very O
poor O
, O
having O
nought O
left O
to O
love O
on O
earth O
, O
and O
I O
cannot O
say O
‘ O
His O

I O
cannot O

my O
lord O

” O
” O
: O
While O
sobbing O
out O
these O
words O
she O
was O
led O
away O
by O
the O
officers O
of O
the O
court O
, O
but O
tenderly O
, O
and O
reverently O
, O
with O
the O
respect O
which O
great O
sorrow O
commands O
. O
‘ O
The O
stream O
of O
evidence O
went O
on O
and O
on O
, O
gathering O
fresh O
force O
from O
every O
witness O
who O
was O
examined O
, O
and O
threatening O
to O
overwhelm O
poor O
Jem S-PERSON
. O
Already O
they O
had O
proved O
that O
the O
gun O
was O
his O
, O
that O
he O
had O
been O
heard O
not O
many O
days O
before O
the O
com- O
mission O
of O
the O
deed O
to O
threaten O
the O
deceased O
| | O
indeed O
, O
that O
the O
police O
had O
, O
at O
that O
time O
, O
been O
obliged O
to O
interfere O
, O
to O
prevent O
some O
probable O
act O
of O
violence O
. O
It O
only O
remained O
to O
bring O
for O
- O
ward O
a O
sufficient O
motive O
for O
the O
threat O
and O
the O
murder O
. O
The O
clue O
to O
this O
had O
been O
furnished O
by O
the O
policeman O
, O
who O
had O
over O
- O
heard O
Jem’s S-PERSON
angry O
language O
to O
Mr. O
Carsons S-PERSON
| | O
and O
his O
report O
in O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
instance O
had O
occasioned O
the O
subpana O
to O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
And O
now O
she O
was O
to O
be O
called O
on O
to O
bear O
witness O
. O
The O
court O
was O
by O
this O
time O
almost O
as O
full O
as O
it O
could O
hold O
| | O
but O
fresh O
at O
- O
tempts O
were O
being O
made O
to O
squeeze O
in O
at O
all O
the O
entrances O
, O
for O
many O
were O
anxious O
to O
see O
and O
hear O
this O
part O
of O
the O
trial O
. O
Old O
Mr. O
Carsons S-PERSON
felt O
an O
additional O
beat O
at O
his O
heart O
at O
the O
thought O
of O
seeing O
the O
fatal O
Helen S-PERSON
, O
the O
cause O
of O
all O
— O
a O
kind O
of O
interest O
and O
yet O
repugnance O
, O
for O
was O
not O
she O
beloved O
by O
the O
dead O
| | O
nay O
, O
perhaps O
in O
her O
way O
, O
loving O
and O
mourning O
for O
the O
same O
being O
that O
he O
himself O
was O
so O
bitterly O
grieving O
over O
? O
And O
yet O
he O
felt O
as O
if O
he O
abhorred O
her O
and O
her O
rumoured O
loveliness O
, O
as O
if O
she O
were O
the O
curse O
against O
him O
| | O
and O
he O
grew O
jealous O
of O
the O
love O
with O
which O
she O
had O
inspired O
his O
son O
, O
and O
would O
fain O
have O
deprived O
her O
of O
even O
her O
natural O
right O
of O
sorrowing O
over O
her O
Jover’s S-PERSON
untimely O
end O
: O
for O
you O
see O
it O
was O
a O
fixed O
idea O
in O
the O
minds O
of O
all O
, O
that O
the O
handsome O
, O
bright O
, O
gay O
, O
rich O
, O
young O
gentleman O
must O
have O
been O
beloved O
in O
preference O
to O
the O
serious O
, O
almost O
stern O
- O
looking O
smith O
, O
who O
had O
to O
toil O
for O
his O
daily O
bread O
. O
Hitherto O
the O
effect O
of O
the O
trial O
had O
equalled O
Mr. O
Carsons’ S-PERSON
most O
sanguine O
hopes O
, O
and O
a O
severe O
look O
of O
satisfaction O
came O
over O
the O
face O
of O
the O
avenger O
, O
— O
over O
that O
countenance O
whence O
the O
smile O
had O
departed O
, O
never O
more O
to O
return O
. O
350 S-CARDINAL
if O
in O
adream O
. O
So O
she O
went O
on O
for O
two S-CARDINAL
or O
three S-CARDINAL
more O
questions O
, O
with O
a O
strange O
wonder O
in O
her O
brain O
, O
as O
the O
reality O
of O
the O
terrible O
circumstances O
in O
which O
she O
was O
placed O
. O
Suddenly O
she O
was O
roused O
, O
she O
knew O
not O
how O
or O
by O
what O
. O
‘ O
She O
was O
conscious O
that O
all O
was O
real O
, O
that O
hundreds S-CARDINAL
were O
looking O
at O
her O
, O
that O
true O
- O
sounding O
words O
were O
being O
extracted O
from O
her O
| | O
that O
that O
figure O
, O
so O
bowed O
down O
, O
with O
the O
face O
concealed O
with O
both O
hands O
, O
was O
really O
Jem O
. O
Ler O
face O
flashed O
scarlet O
, O
and O
then O
, O
paler O
than O
before O
. O
But O
in O
dread O
of O
herself O
, O
with O
the O
tremendous O
secret O
imprisoned O
within O
her O
, O
she O
exerted O
every O
power O
she O
had O
to O
keep O
in O
the O
full O
understanding O
of O
what O
was O
going O
on O
, O
of O
what O
she O
was O
asked O
, O
and O
of O
what O
she O
answered O
. O
With O
all O
her O
faculties O
preternaturally O
alive O
and O
sensitive O
, O
she O
heard O
the O
next O
question O
from O
the O
pert O
young O
barrister O
, O
who O
was O
delighted O
to O
have O
the O
examination O
of O
this O
witness O
. O
“ O
“ O
And O
pray O
, O
may O
Lask S-PERSON
, O
which O
was O
the O
favoured O
lover O
? O
You O
say O
you O
knew O
both O
these O
young O
men O
. O
Which O
was O
the O
favoured O
lover O
? O
Which O
did O
you O
prefer O
And O
who O
was O
he O
, O
the O
questioner O
, O
that O
he O
should O
dare O
80 S-DATE
lightly O
to O
ask O
of O
her O
heart’s O
secrets O
? O
That O
he O
should O
dare O
to O
ask O
her O
to O
tell O
, O
before O
that O
multitude O
assembled O
there O
, O
what O
woman O
usually O
whispers O
with O
blushes O
and O
tears O
, O
and O
many O
hesita- O
tions O
, O
to O
one O
ear O
alone O
? O
So O
, O
for O
an O
instant O
, O
a O
look O
of O
indignation O
contracted O
Mary's S-PERSON
brow O
, O
as O
she O
steadily O
met O
the O
eyes O
of O
the O
impertinent O
counsellor O
. O
But O
, O
in O
that O
instant O
, O
she O
saw O
the O
hands O
removed O
from O
a O
face O
beyond O
, O
behind O
| | O
and O
# O
countenance O
revealed O
of O
such O
intense O
love O
and O
woe O
, O
— O
such O
a O
deprecating O
dread O
of O
her O
answer O
| | O
and O
suddenly O
her O
resolution O
was O
taken O
. O
The O
present O
was O
every O
thing O
| | O
the O
future O
, O
that O
vast O
shroud O
, O
it O
was O
maddening O
to O
think O
upon O
| | O
but O
now O
she O
might O
own O
her O
fault O
, O
but O
now O
she O
might O
even O
own O
her O
love O
. O
Now O
, O
when O
the O
beloved O
stood O
thus O
, O
abhorred O
of O
men O
, O
there O
would O
be O
no O
feminine O
shame O
to O
stand O
between O
her O
and O
her O
avowal O
. O
So O
she O
also O
turned O
towards O
the O
judge O
, O
partly O
to O
mark O
that O
her O
answer O
was O
not O
given O
to O
the O
monkeyfied O
man O
who O
questioned O
her O
, O
and O
likewise O
that O
her O
face O
might O
be O
averted O
from O
, O
and O
her O
eyes O
not O
gaze O
upon O
, O
the O
form O
that O
contracted O
with O
the O
dread O
of O
the O
words O
he O
anticipated O
. O

The O

avoided O
much O

to O
himself O
the O
right O

little O

such O
vague O
instructions O

understood O
that O
so O
much O
depended O

the O
evidence O

one O

hope O

contented O
himself O

occasionally O
taking O

pinch O

All O
this O

told O

few O
words O

so O

that O

rose O

Job B-PERSON
Legh E-PERSON
looked O
about O
for O
Mary S-PERSON

now O
he O
had O
gained O
, O
and O
given O
, O
some O
idea O
of O
the O
position O
of O
things O

At O
last O
he O
saw O
her O
, O
standing O
by O
a O
decent O
- O
looking O
woman O
, O
looking O
flushed O
and O
anxious O

moving O
her O
lips O
incessantly O
, O
as O
if O
eagerly O
talking O

her O
eyes O
never O
resting O
on O
any O
object O

wandering O
about O
as O
if O
in O
search O

something O
. O
Job O
thought O
it O
was O
for O
him O
she O
was O
seeking O
, O
and O
he O
struggled O
to O
get O
round O
to O
her O
. O
When O
he O
bad O
succeeded O
, O
she O
took O
no O
notice O
of O
him O
, O
although O
he O
spoke O
to O
her O
, O
but O
still O
kept O
looking O
round O
and O
round O
in O
the O
same O
wild O
, O
restless O
manner O
. O
He O
tried O
to O
hear O
the O
low O
quick O
mutterings O
of O
her O
voice O
| | O
he O
caught O
the O
repetition O
of O
the O
same O
words O
over O
and O
over O
again O
. O
“ O
J O
must O
not O
go O
mad O
. O
I O
must O
not O

Suddenly O
she O
seemed O
to O
become O
aware O
how O
earnestly O
Job O
was O
356 S-CARDINAL

much O
out O
of O
earnestness O
to O
save O
the O
prisoner O

of O
whose O
inno- O
cence O
he O
was O
still O
doubtful O

he O
saw O
the O
opportunities O

while O
the O

for O

prepared O
himself O
by O
folding O
his O
arms O

elevating O
his O
eyebrows O
, O
and O
putting O
his O
lips O
in O
the O
form O
in O
which O
they O
might O
best O
whistle O
down O

against O

opinion O

“ O

may O
prove O

when O

felt O
that O

heard O

him O
pale O

careworn O
at O

his O
courage O
took O
the O
shape O
of O
presence O
of O
mind O
, O
and O
he O
awaited O
the O
examination O
with O
a O
calm O
, O
unflinching O
intelligence O
, O
which O
dictated O
the O
clearest O
and O
most O
pertinent O
answers O

told O

well O

How O
his O
leave O

all O
expended O

how O

, O
it O
had O
been O
necessary O
for O
him O

walk O

was O
clear O

distinct O

breadth O
between O
him O
and O
a O
felon’s O
death O
, O
and O
the O
love O
that O
had O
lightened O
the O
dark O
shadow O
, O
made O
him O
bear O
366 S-CARDINAL
watching O
for O
some O
word O
or O
sign O
which O
should O
betoken O
his O
‘ O
wish O
to O
return O
to O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
And O
yet O
go O
to O
Liverpool S-GPE
he O
must O
and O
would O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
funeral O
was O
over O
, O
if O
but O
for O
a O
simple O
glimpse O
of O
his O
darling O
. O
For O
Job O
had O
never O
written O

indeed O
, O
any O
necessity O
for O
his O
so O
doing O
had O
never O
entered O
his O
head O
. O
If O
Mary S-PERSON
died O
, O
he O
would O
announce O
it O
personally O
| | O
if O
she O
recovered O
, O
he O
meant O
to O
bring O
her O
home O
with O
him O
. O
Writing O
was O
to O
him O
little O
more O
than O
an O
auxiliary O
to O
natural O
history O

a O
way O
of O
ticketing O
specimens O
, O
not O
of O
expressing O
thoughts O
. O
The O
consequence O
of O
this O
want O
of O
intelligence O
as O
to O
Mary's S-PERSON
state O
was O
, O
that O
Jem S-PERSON
was O
constantly O
anticipating O
that O
every O
person O
and O
every O
scrap O
of O
paper O
was O
to O
convey O
to O
him O
the O
news O
of O
her O
death O
. O
He O
could O
not O
endure O
this O
state O
long O
| | O
but O
he O
resolved O
not O
to O
disturb O
the O
house O
by O
announcing O
to O
his O
mother O
his O
proposed O
intention O
of O
returning O
to O
Liverpool S-GPE
, O
until O
the O
dead O
had O
been O
carried O
forth O
. O
On O
Sunday B-TIME
afternoon E-TIME
, O
they O
laid O
her O
low O
with O
many O
tears O
. O
‘ O
Will O
wept O
as O
one O
who O
would O
not O
be O
comforted O
. O
The O
old O
childish O
feeling O
came O
over O
him O
, O
the O
feeling O
of O
lone- O
liness O
at O
being O
left O
among O
strangers O
. O
By O
and O
bye O
, O
Margaret S-PERSON
timidly O
stole O
near O
him O
, O
as O
if O
waiting O
to O
console O
| | O
and O
soon O
his O
passion O
sank O
down O
to O
grief O
, O
and O
grief O
gave O
way O
to O
melancholy O
, O
and O
though O
he O
felt O
as O
though O
he O
never O
could O
be O
joyful O
again O
, O
he O
was O
all O
the O
while O
unconsciously O
ap O
- O
proaching O
nearer O
to O
the O
full O
happiness O
of O
calling O
Margaret S-PERSON
his O
own O
, O
and O
a O
golden O
thread O
was O
interwoven O
even O
now O
with O
the O
darkness O
of O
his O
sorrow O
. O
Yet O
it O
was O
on O
his O
arm O
that O
Jane B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
leant O
on O
her O
return O
homewards O
. O
Jem S-PERSON
took O
charge O
of O
Margaret S-PERSON
. O
“ O
Margaret S-PERSON

bound O
for O
Liverpool S-GPE

” O
“ O
I'm O
sure O
he O
likes O
nothing O
better O
than O
watching O
over O
poor O
Mary S-PERSON

he O
loves O
her O
nearly O
as O
well O
as O
me O
. O
But O
let O
me O
go O
! O
I O
have O
been O
so O
full O
of O
poor O
Alice S-PERSON

never O
thought O

it O
before O

I O
can’t O
do O
so O
much O
as O
many O

Mary S-PERSON
will O
like O

have O
a O
woman O
about O
her O

knows O

sorry O

replied O
Margaret S-PERSON

with O
some O
little O
self O

you O

Will's S-PERSON
there O
, O
perhaps O
I O
need O
not O
step O
up O

” O
“ O
Yes O
, O
Margaret S-PERSON
, O
do O

come O

now O
good O
- O
bye O

Stay O
! O
do O
you O
think O
you O
could O
just O
coax O
poor O
Will O
to O
walk O
a O
bit O
home O
with O
you O
, O
that O
I O
might O
speak O
to O
mother O
by O
myself O
? O
” O
No O
! O
that O
Margaret S-PERSON
could O
not O
do O
. O
That O
was O
expecting O
too O
great O
a O
sacrifice O
of O
bashful O
feeling O
. O
But O
the O
object O
was O
accomplished O
by O
Will’s S-PERSON
going O
up O
- O
stairs O
immediately O
on O
their O
return O
to O
the O
house O
, O
to O
indulge O
his O
mournful O
thoughts O
alone O
. O
As O
soon O
as O
Jem S-PERSON
and O
his O
mother O
were O
left O
by O
themselves O
, O
he O
began O
on O
the O
subject O
uppermost O
in O
his O
mind O
. O
“ O
Mother O
! O
” O
She O
put O
her O
handkerchief O
from O
her O
eyes O
, O
and O
turned O
quickly O
round O
so O
as O
to O
face O
him O
where O
he O
stood O
, O
thinking O
what O
best O
to O
say O
. O
The O
little O
action O
annoyed O
him O
, O
and O
he O
rushed O
at O
once O
into O
the O
subject O
. O
“ O
Mother O
! O
Iam O
going O
back O
to O
Liverpool S-GPE
to O
- O
morrow O
morning O
to O
see O
how O
Mary B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
is O
. O
” O
” O
“ O
And O
what’s O
Mary B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
to O
thee O
, O
that O
thou O
shouldst O
be O
running O
after O
her O
in O
that O
- O
a- O
way O
? O
” O
” O
“ O
If O
she O
lives O
, O
she O
shall O
be O
my O
wedded O
wife O
. O
If O
she O
dies O
— O
mother O
, O
I O
can’t O
speak O
of O
what O
I O
shall O
feel O
if O
she O
dies O
. O
” O
His O
voice O
was O
choked O
in O
his O
throat O
. O
For O
an O
instant O
his O
mother O
was O
interested O
by O
his O
words O
| | O
and O
then O
came O
back O
the O
old O
jealousy O
of O
being O
supplanted O
in O
the O
af- O
fections O
of O
that O
son O
, O
who O
had O
been O
, O
as O
it O
were O
, O
newly O
born O
to O
her O
, O
by O
the O
escape O
he O
had O
so O
lately O
experienced O
from O
danger O
. O
So O
she O
hardened O
her O
heart O
against O
entertaining O
any O
feeling O
of O
sympathy O
| | O
and O
turned O
away O
from O
the O
face O
, O
which O
recalled O
the O
earnest O
look O
of O
his O
childhood O
, O
when O
he O
had O
come O
to O
her O
in O
some O
trouble O
, O
sure O
of O
help O
and O
comfort O
. O
And O
coldly O
she O
spoke O
, O
in O
those O
which O
tones O
Jem S-PERSON
knew O
and O
dreaded O
, O
even O
before O
the O
meaning O
they O
expressed O
was O
fally O
shaped O
. O
“ O
Thou O
'rt O
old O
enough O
to O
please O
' O
thysel O
. O
Old O
mothers O
are O
cast O
aside O
, O
and O
what O
they O
‘ve O
borne O
forgotten O
as O
soon O
as O
a O
pretty O
face O
comes O
across O
. O
I O
might O
have O
thought O
of O
that O
last B-DATE

” O
She O
sighed O
sorrowfully O
. O
“ O
Mother O
! O

said O
he O
, O
atlast O

stopping O
short O
, O
and O
taking O
her O
hand O
in O
his O
with O
tender O
affection O
, O
“ O

sad O
voice O

still O
hovered O
between O

when O
Jem S-PERSON
arrived O
at O
the O
house O

lay O

the O

the O

was O
less O

than O

And O
now O
Jem S-PERSON
found O
the O
difficulty O
which O
every O
one O
who O
has O
watched O
by O
a O
sick O
bed O
knows O
full O
well O

and O
which O
is O
perhaps O
more O
insurmountable O
to O
men O
than O
it O
is O
to O
women O
, O
— O
the O
difficulty O
of O
being O
patient O
, O
and O
trying O
not O
to O
expect O
any O
visible O
change O
for O
long O
, O
long O
hours O
of O
sad O
monotony O

But O
after O
awhile O
the O
reward O
came O
. O
The O
laboured O
breathing O
became O
lower O
and O
softer O
, O
the O
heavy O
look O
of O
oppressive O
pain O
melted O
away O
from O
the O
face O
, O
and O
a O
languor O
that O
was O
almost O
peace O
took O
the O
place O
of O
suffering O
. O
She O
slept O
a O
natural O
sleep O

they O
stole O
about O
on O

and O
spoke O
low O
, O
and O
softly O
, O
and O
hardly O
dared O
to O
breathe O
, O
however O
much O
they O
longed O
to O
sigh O
out O
their O
thankful O
relief O

She O
opened O
her O

of O
the O

soothed O

quite O

his O

required O

For O
he O
might O
find O
, O
in O

that O

the O

him O

with O

, O
that O
met O
him O
on O

Jem S-PERSON

that O
his O

attainted O

and O
that O
to O
many O
it O

at O

no O

he O
turned O

not O

he O
had O
threatened O

all O

he O

escaping O

So O
he O
tried O
to O
banish O
the O
phantom O
voices O

came O
unbidden O
to O
his O
brain O

to O
recall O
his O
balance O
of O
mind O
by O
walking O
calmly O
and O
slowly O
, O
and O
noticing O
every O
thing O
which O
struck O
his O
senses O
. O
It O
was O
a O
warm O
soft O
evening O
in O
spring O

there O
were O
many O
persons O

a O
nurse O

conveying O
her O
home O
from O
some O
children’s O
gaicty O

a O
dance O
most O
likely O

for O
the O
lovely O
little O
creature O
was O
daintily O

out O
in O
soft O

snowy O
muslin O

and O
her O
fairy O
feet O
tripped O
along O
by O
her O
nurse’s O
side O
, O
as O
if O
to O
the O
measure O
of O
some O
tune O
she O
had O
lately O
kept O
time O
to O
. O
Suddenly O
up O
behind O
her O
there O
came O
a O
rough O
, O
rude O
errand O
- O
boy O
, O
nine S-DATE

ten B-DATE

fairy O

child O

as O
she O
fluttered O
along O
. O
I O
don’t O
know O
how O
it O
was O
, O
but O
in O
some O
awkward O
way O
he O
knocked O
the O
poor O
little O
girl O
down O
upon O
the O
hard O
pavement O
as O
he O
brushed O
rudely O
past O
, O
not O
much O
caring O
whom O
he O
hurt O
, O
so O
that O
he O
got O
along O
. O
The O
child O
arose O
sobbing O
with O
pain O
| | O
and O
not O
without O
cause O
, O
for O
blood O
was O
dropping O
down O
from O
the O
face O
, O
but O

bright O

dropping O
down O
on O
the O
pretty O
frock O
, O
making O
those O
scarlet O
marks O
so O
terrible O
to O
little O
children O
. O
The O
nurse O
, O
a O
powerful O
woman O
, O
had O
seized O
the O
boy O
, O
just O
as O
Mr. O
Carsons S-PERSON
( O
who O
had O
seen O
the O
whole O

came O
up O

accompanying O
every O
sentence O
with O
a O
violent O
jerk O
of O
pas- O

The O
lad O
looked O
hard O

defying O

withal O
terrified O
at O

had O
confessed O

and O
yet O
( O
strange O
to O
say O

he O
could O
not O
hate O
him O
with O
the O
vehemence O
of O

In O

the O
revengeful O

he O
considered O
as O
a O
duty O
to O
his O
dead O

something O

contrasted O

Then O
he O
roused O
himself O
from O

turned O

he O
left O
the O
house O
in O
search O
of O
a O
druggist’s O
shop O
, O
which O
should O
be O
open O
at O
that B-TIME
early I-TIME
hour E-TIME
. O
During O
his O
absence O
, O
Barton S-PERSON
grew O
worse O

he O
had O
fallen O
across O
the O
bed O
, O

his O
breathing O
seemed O
almost O
stopped O

in O
vain O
did O
Mary S-PERSON
strive O
to O
raise O
him O
, O
her O
sorrow O
and O
exhaustion O
had O
rendered O
. O
her O
too O
weak O

So O
, O
on O
hearing O
some O
one O
enter O
the O
house O
- O
place O
below O
, O
she O
cried O
out O
for O
Jem S-PERSON
to O
come O
to O
her O
assistance O
. O
Astep O
, O
which O
was O
not O

came O
up O
the O
stairs O
. O
Mr. O
Carsons S-PERSON
stood O
in O
the O
door O

way O

In O
one S-CARDINAL
instant O
he O
com- O
prehended O
the O
case O
. O
He O
raised O
up O
the O
powerless O
frame O

and O
the O
departing O
soul O
looked O
out O
of O
the O
eyes O
with O
gratitude O
. O
He O
held O
the O
dying O
man O
propped O
in O
his O
arms O
, O
John B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
folded O
his O
hands O
, O
as O
if O
in O
prayer O

“ O
Pray O
for O

said O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
sinking O
on O
her O
knees O
, O
and O
for O

getting O
in O
that O
solemn O
hour O
all O
that O
had O
divided O
her O
father O
and O
Mr. O
Carsons S-PERSON
. O
No O
other O
words O
would O
suggest O
themselves O
than O
some O
of O
those O
he O
had O
read O
only B-TIME
a I-TIME
few I-TIME
hours E-TIME
before O

“ O

And O
when O
the O

were O
said O

John B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
lay O
a O
corpse O
in O
Mr. O
Carsons’ S-PERSON
arms O

So O
ended O
the O
tragedy O
of O
a O
poor O
man’s O
life O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
knew O
nothing O
more O
for O
many B-TIME
minutes E-TIME

When O
she O
re- O
covered O

she O
found O
herself O

Mr. O

were O
there O
, O
talking O
together O
lowly O

solemnly O

Then O
Mr. O
Carsons S-PERSON
bade O
farewell O
and O
left O
the O
house O

and O
Job S-PERSON
said O
aloud O
, O
but O
as O

“ O

‘ O
The B-DATE
day E-DATE
brought O
its O
burden O
of O
duty O
to O
Mrs. O
Wilson S-PERSON
. O
She O
felt O
bound O
by O
regard O

well O
as O
by O
etiquette O
, O
to O
go O

see O
her O

in O

And O
by O
an O
old O
association O
of O
ideas O
( O
perhaps O
of O
death O
with O

, O
she O
thought O

it O
necessary O
to O
put O
on O
her O
best O
, O
and O
latterly O
unused O
clothes O
, O
the O
airing O
of O
which O
on O
a O
little O
clothes O
- O
horse O
before O
the O
fire O
seemed O
to O
give O
her O
a O
not O
unpleasing O
occupation O
. O
When O
Jem S-PERSON
returned O
home O
late B-TIME
in I-TIME
the I-TIME
evening E-TIME
succeeding O
John B-PERSON
Barton’s E-PERSON
death O
, O
weary O
and O
oppressed O
with O
the O
occurrences O
and O
excitements O
of O
the O
day O
, O
he O
found O
his O
mother O
busy O
about O
her O
mourning O
, O
and O
much O
inclined O
to O
talk O
. O
Although O
he O
longed O
for O
quiet O
, O
he O
could O
not O
avoid O
sitting O
down O
and O
answering O
her O
questions O
. O
“ O
Well O
, O
Jem O
! O
he’s O
gone O
at O
last O
, O
ishe O
? O
” O
“ O
Yes O
. O
How O
did O
you O
hear O
, O
mother O
? O
” O
_ O
“ O
Oh O
, O
Job O
came O
over O
here O
, O
and O
telled O
me O

on O
his O
way O
to O
the O
undertaker’s O
. O
Did O
he O
make O
a O
fine O
end O
? O
” O
It O
struck O
Jem S-PERSON
that O
she O
had O
not O
heard O
of O
the O
confession O
which O
had O
been O
made O
byJohn B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
on O
his O
death O
- O
bed O
| | O
he O
remembered O
Job B-PERSON
Legh’s E-PERSON
discretion O
, O
and O
he O
determined O
that O
if O
it O
could O
be O
avoided O
his O
mother O
should O
never O
hear O
of O
it O
. O
Many O
of O
the O
diffi- O
culties O
to O
be O
anticipated O
in O
preserving O
the O
secret O
would O
be O
ob- O
viated O
, O
if O
he O
could O
induce O
his O
mother O
to O
fall O
into O
the O
plan O
he O
had O
named O
to O
Mary S-PERSON
of O
emigrating O
to O
Canada S-GPE
. O
The O
reasons O
which O
rendered O
this O
secrecy O
desirable O
related O
to O
the O
domestic O
happiness O
he O
hoped O
for O
. O
With O
his O
mother’s O
irritable O
temper O
he O
could O
hardly O
expect O
that O
all O
allusion O
to O
the O
crime O
of O
John B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
would O
be O
for O
ever O
restrained O
from O
passing O
her O
lips O
, O
and O
he O
knew O
the O
deep O
trial O
which O
such O
references O
would O
be O
to O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
Accordingly O
he O
re- O
solved O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
in O
the O
morning O
to O
goto O
Job O
, O
and O
be- O
seech O
his O
silence O
| | O
he O
trusted O
that O
secrecy O
in O
that B-DATE
quarter E-DATE
, O
even O
if O
the O
knowledge O
had O
been O
extended O
to O
Margaret S-PERSON
, O
might O
be O
easily O
secured O
. O
But O
what O
would O
be O
Mr. O
Carson’s S-PERSON
course O
? O
Were O
there O
any O
means O
by O
which O
he O
might O
be O
persuaded O
to O
spare O
John B-PERSON
Barton's E-PERSON
memory O

“ O

a O
bitter O
