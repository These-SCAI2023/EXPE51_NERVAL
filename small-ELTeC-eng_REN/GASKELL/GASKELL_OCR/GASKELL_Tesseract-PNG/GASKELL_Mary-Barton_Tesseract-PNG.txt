‘The more I reflected on this unhappy state of things between
those so bound to each other by common interests, as the em-
ployers and the employed must ever be, the more anxious I
became to give some utterance to the agony which, from time
to time, convulses this dumb people; the agony of suffering
without the sympathy of the happy, or of erroneously believing
that such is the case. If it be an error, that the woes, which
come with ever-returning tide-like flood to overwhelm the
workmen in our manufacturing towns, pass unregarded by all
but the sufferers, it is at any rate an error so bitter in ite
consequences to all parties, that whatever public effort can
do in the way of legislation, or private effort in the way of
mercifal deeds, or helpless love in the way of “widow's mites,”
should be done, and that speedily, to disabuse the work-people
of so miserable a misapprehension. At present they seem to me
to beleft ina state, wherein lamentations and tears are thrown
aside as useless, but in which the lips are compressed for curses,
and the hands clenched and ready to smite.

I know nothing of Political Economy, or the theories of
trade. I have tried to write truthfully; and if my accounts
agree or clash with any system, the agreement or disagreement
is unintentional.

To myself the idea which I have formed of the state of
feeling among too many of the factory-people in Manchester,
and which I endeavoured to represent in this tale (completed
above a year ago), has received some confirmation from the
events which have so recently occurred among a similar class
on the Continent.

licious sounds of rural life: the lowing of cattle, the milk-
maid’s call, the clatter and cackle of poultry.in’the old farm-
yards. You cannot wonder, then, that these‘fieldg are popu-
lar places of resort at every holiday tihe;"dact you would not
wonder, if you, could \ce,: 6¢ Eproperly describe, the charm
of ono pettigulay style, tlrat it should be, on such occasions, a

owded Tatting-place. Close by it is a deep, clear pond,
fleeting in its dark green depths the shadowy trees that bend
‘over it to exclude the sun. ‘The only place where its banks
are shelving is on the side next to a rambling farm-yard, be-
longing to one of those old-world, gabled, black and white
houses I named above, overlooking the field through which
the public footpath leads. ‘The porch of this farm-house is
covered by arose-tree; and the little garden surrounding itis
crowded with a medley of old-fashioned herbs and flowers,
planted long ago, when the garden was the only druggist’s
shop within reach, and allowed to grow in scrambling and
wild luxuriance — roses, lavender, sage, balm (for tea),
rosemary, pinks and wall-flowers, onions and jessamine,
in most republican and indiscriminate order. This farm-
house and garden are within a hundred yards of the stile of
which I epoke, leading from the large pasture field into a
smaller one, divided by a hedge of hawthorn and black-thorn ;
and near this stile, on the further side, there runs a tale that
primoses may often be found, and occasionally the blue sweet
violet on the grassy hedge bank.

I do not know whether it was ona holiday granted by the
masters, or a holiday seized in right of nature and her beauti-
ful spring time by the workmen, but one afternoon (now ten
or a dozen years ago) these fields were much thronged. It
‘was an early May evening — the April of the poets; for heavy
showers had fallen all the morning, and the round, soft, white
clouds which were blown by a west wind over the dark blue
sky, were sometimes varied by one blacker and more
threatening. The softness of the day tempted forth the young
green leaves, which almost visibly fluttered into life; and the
willows, which that morning had had only a brown reflection

sisters; never. Not but what beauty is asad snare. Here
was Esther so puffed up, that there was no holding her in.
Her spirit was always up, if I spoke ever so little in the way of
advice to her; my wife spoiled her, it is true, for you see she
‘was so much older than Esther she was more like a mother to
her, doing every thing for her.”

«I wonder she ever left you,” observed his friend.

“That ’s the worst of factory work for girls. They can
earn so much when work is plenty, that they can maintain
themselves any how. My Mary shall never work in a factory,
that I’m determined on. You see Esther spent her money in
dress, thinking to set off her pretty face; and got to come home
so late at night, that at last I told her my mind: my missis
thinks I spoke crossly, but I meant right, for I loved Esther,
if it was only for Mary’s sake. Says I, ‘Esther, I see what
yo ‘ll end at with your artificials, and your fly-away veils, and
stopping out when honest women are in their beds; you ‘Il be
astreet-walker Esther, and then, don’t you go to think I "IL
have you darken my door, though my wife is your sister.” So
says she, ‘Don’t trouble yourself, John. I'll pack up and be
off now, for I'll never stay to hear myself called as you call
me.’ She flushed up like a turkey-cock, and I thought fire
would come out of her eyes; but when she saw Mary cry (for
Mary can’t abide words in a house), she went and kissed her,
and said she was not so bad asI thought her. So we talked
more friendly, for, as I said, I liked the lass well enough, and
her pretty looks, and her cheery ways. But she said (and at
that time I thought there was sense in what she said) we
should be much better friends if she went ‘into lodgings, and
only came to see us now and then.”

“Then you atill were friendly. Folks said you ’d cast her
off, and said you ’d never speak to her again.”

“Folks always make one a deal worse than one is,” said
John Barton, testily. “She came many a time to our house
after she left off living with us. Last Sunday se’nnight — no!
it was this very last Sunday, she came to drink a cup of tea
with Mary; and that was the last time we set eyes on her.”

eye brightened, asin the distance, among a group of girls, he
spied his only daughter, a bonny lass of thirteen or 0, who
came bounding along to meet and to greet her father, in a
manner that showed that the stern-looking man had a tender
nature within. The two men had crossed the last stile, while
Mary loitered behind to gather some buds of the coming haw-
thorn, when an overgrown lad came past her, and snatched a
kiss, exclaiming, “For old acquaintance sake, Mary.”

“Take that for old acquaintance sake, then,” said the girl,
blushing rosy red, more with anger than shame, as she slapped
his face. The tones of her voice called back her father and
his friend, and the aggressor proved to be the eldest son of
the latter, the senior by eighteen years of his little brothers.

“Here, children, instead o’ kissing and*quarrelling, do
ye each take a baby, for if Wilson’s arms be like mine they
are heartily tired.”

Mary sprang forward to take her father’s charge, with a
girl’s fondness for infants, and with some little foresight of the
event soon to happen at home; while young Wilson seemed to
lose his rough, cubbish nature as he crowed and coved to his
little brother.

“Twins is a great trial to a poor man, bless ’em,”’ said the
half-proud, half-weary father, as he bestowed a smacking kiss
on the babe ere he parted with it.

Polly, put the kettle on,

‘And we 'll all have tea.

“Here we are, wife; didst thou think thou’d lost us?”
quoth hearty-voiced Wilson, as the two women rose and
shook themselves in preparation for their homeward walk.
Mrs. Barton was evidently soothed, if not cheered, by the
unburdening of her fears and thoughts to her friend; and her
approving look went far to second her husband’s invitation
that the whole party should adjourn from Green Heys Fields

(seeing the lassie fain to be off), “you must get a pennyworth
of milk and a loaf of bread — mind you get it fresh and new —
and, and — that’s all, Mary.”

“No, it’s not all,” said her husband. ‘Thou must get
sixpennyworth of rum, to warm the tea; thou 'll get it at the
‘Grapes.’ And thou just go to Alice Wilson; he says she
lives just right round the corner, under 14, Barber street”
(this was addressed to his wife), “and tell her to come and
take her tea with us; she'll like to see her brother, I'll be
bound, let alone Jane and the twins.”

“If she comes she must bring a tea-cup and saucer, for
we have but half-a-dozen, and here’s six of us,” said Mrs.
Barton.

“Pooh! pooh! Jem and Mary can drink out of one,
surely.”

But Mary secretly determined to take care that Alice
brought her tea-cup and saucer, if the alternative was to be
her sharing any thing with Jem.

Alice Wilson had but just come in. She had been out all
day in the fields, gathering wild herbs for drinks and medi-
cine, for in addition to her invaluable qualities as a sick nurse
and her worldly occupations as a washer-woman, she added a
considerable knowledge of hedge and field simples; and on
fine days, when no more profitable occupation offered itself,
she used to ramble off into the lanes and meadows as far as her
legs could carry her. This evening she had returned loaded
with nettles, and her first object was to light a candle and
see to hang them up in bunches in every available place in her
cellar room. It was the perfection of cleanliness; in one
corner stood the modest looking bed, with a check curtain at
the head, the whitewashed wall filling up the place where the
corresponding one should have been. The floor was bricked,
and scrupulously clean, although so damp that it seemed as
if the last washing would never dry up. As the cellar window
looked into an area in the street, down which boys might
throw stones, it was protected by an outside shutter, and
was oddly festooned with all manner of hedge row, ditch,

CHAPTER III.
“But when the morn came dim and sad,
And with early showers,
Her quiet eyelids closed — she bad
‘Another morn than ours.” Hoon.

In the middle of that same night a neighbour of the Bar-
tons was roused from her sound, well-earned sleep, by a
knocking, which had at first made part of her dream; but
starting up, as soon as she became convinced of its reality,
she opened the window, and asked who was there?

“Me — John Barton,” answered he in a voice tremulous
with agitation. “My missis is in labour, and, for the love
of God, step in while I run for th’ doctor, for she’s fearful
bad.”

‘While the woman hastily dressed herself, leaving the win-
dow still open, she heard the cries of agony, which resounded
in the little court in the stillness of the night. In less than five
minutes she was standing by Mrs. Barton’s bed-side, relieving
the terrified Mary, who went about, where she was told, like
an automaton; her eyes tearless, her face calm, though
deadly pale, and uttering no sound, except when‘her teeth
chattered for very nervousness.

‘The cries grew worse.

‘The doctor was very long in hearing the repeated rings
at his night-bell, and still longer in understanding who it was
that made this sudden call upon his services; and then he
begged Barton just to wait while he dressed himself, in order
that-no time might be lost in finding the court and house.
Barton absolutely stamped with impatience, outside the
doctor's door, before he came down; and walked so fast
homewards, that the medical man several times asked him to
go slower.

“Is she so very bad?” asked he.

“Worse, much worser than I ever saw her before,” re-
plied John.

‘No! she was not — she was at peace. ‘The cries were still
for ever. John had no time for listening. He opened the

   

 


 

22
thoughts about her had been tinged with wonder and pity, but
now he hardened his heart against her for ever.

One of the good influences over John Barton’s life had de-
parted that night. ne of the ties which bound him down to
the gentle humanities of carth was loosened, and hencefor-
ward the neighbours all remarked he was a changed man.
His gloom and his sternness became habitual instead of occa-
sional. He was more obstinate. But never to Mary. Be-
tween the father and the daughter there existed in full force
that mysterious bond which unites those who have been loved
by one who is now dead and gone. While he was harsh and
silent to others, he humoured Mary with tender love; she had
more of her own way than is common in any rank with girls of
her age. Part of this was the necessity of the case; for, of
course, all the money went through her hands, and the house-
hold arrangements were guided by her will and pleasure. But
part was her father’s indulgence, for he left her, with full
trust in her unusual sense and spirit, to choose her own asso-
ciates, and her own times for seeing her associates.

With all this, Mary had not her father’s confidence in
the matters which now began to occupy him, heart and soul;
she was aware that he had joined clubs, and become an ac-
tive member of the Trades’ Union, but it was hardly likely
that a girl of Mary’s age (even when two or three years had
elapsed since her mother’s death) should care much for the
differences between the employers and the employed, — an
eternal subject for agitation in the manufacturing districts,
which, however it may be lulled for a time, is sure to break
forth again with fresh violence at any depression of trade,
showing that in its apparent quiet, the ashes had still smoul-
dered in the breasts of a few. .

Among these few was John Barton. [At all times it is a
bewildering thing to the poor weaver to see his employer
removing from house to house, each one grander than the
last, till he ends in building one more magnificent than all, or
withdraws his money from the concern, or sells his mill, to
buy an estate in the country, while all the time the weaver,

 

24

to supply all his wants by his own exertions. And when his
master suddenly failed, and all hands in the mill were turned
back, one Tuesday morning, with the news that Mr. Hunter
had stopped, Barton had only a few shillings to rely on; but
he had good heart of being employed at some other mill, and
accordingly, before returning home, he spent some hours in
going from factory to factory, asking for work. But at every
mill was some sign of depression of trade! some were working
short hours, some were turning off hands, and for weeks
Barton was out of work, living on credit. It was during this
time that his little son, the apple of his eye, the cynosure
of all his strong power of love, fell ill of the scarlet fever.
They dragged him through the crisis, but his life hung on a
gossamer thread. Every thing, the doctor said, depended
on good nourishment, on generous living, to keep up the
little fellow’s strength, in the prostration in which the fever
had left him. Mocking words! when the commonest food in
the house would not furnish one little meal. Barton tried
credit; but it was worn out at the little provision shops which
were now suffering in their turn. He thought it would be no
sin to steal, and would have stolen; but he could not get the
opportunity in the few days the child lingered. Hungry him-
self, almost to an animal pitch of ravenousness, but with the
bodily pain swallowed up in anxiety for his little sinking lad,
he stood at one of the shop windows where all edible luxuries
are displayed; haunches of venison, Stilton cheeses, moulds
of jelly — all appetising sights to the common passer-by. And
out of this shop came Mrs. Hunter! She crossed to her
carriage, followed by the shopman loaded with purchases for
a party. The door was quickly slammed to, and she drove
away; and Barton returned home with a bitter spirit of wrath
in his heart, to see his only boy a corpse!

You can fancy, now, the hoards of vengeance in his heart
against the employers. For there are never wanting those
who, either in speech or in print, find it their interest to
cherish such feelings in the working classes; who know how
and when to rouse the dangerous power at their command;

 

26

and in their freedom told the truth (whatever it might be) to
every passer-by, had early let Mary into the secret of her
beauty. If their remarks had fallen on an unheeding ear,
there were always young men enough, in a different rank
from her own, who were willing to compliment the pretty
weaver’s daughter as they met her in the streets. Besides, trust
a girl of sixteen for knowing it well if she is pretty; concerning
her plainness she may be ignorant. So with this conscious-
ness she had early determined that her beauty should make
her a lady; the rank she coveted the more for her father’s
abuse; the rank to which she firmly believed her lost Aunt
Esther had arrived. Now, while a servant must often drudge
and be dirty, must be known as her servant by all who visited
at her master’s house, a dressmaker’s apprentice must (or so
Mary thought) be always dressed with a certain regard to
appearance; must never soil her hands, and need never
redden or dirty her face with hard labour. Before my telling
you so truly what folly Mary felt or thought, injures her
without redemption in your opinion, think what are the silly
fancies of sixteen years of age in every class, and under all
circumstances. The end of all the thoughts of father and
daughter was, asI said before, Mary was to be a dressmaker;
and her ambition prompted her unwilling father to apply at all
the first establishments, to know on what terms of painstaking
and zeal his daughter might be admitted into ever so humble
a workwoman’s situation. But high premiums were asked at
all; poorman! he might have known that without giving up a
day’s work to ascertain the fact. He would have been in-
dignant, indeed, had he known that if Mary had accom-
panied him, the case might have been rather different, as her
beauty would have made her desirable as a show-woman.
"Then he tried second-rate places; at all the payment of a sum
of money was necessary, and moncy he had none. Dis-
heartened and angry he went home at night, declaring it was
time lost; that dressmaking was at all events a toilsome busi-
ness, and not worth learning. Mary saw that the grapes were
sour, and the next day she set out herself, as her father

affair was more for apparent dignity of position than for any
real ease); a little, very little round table, put just before the
fire, which by this time was blazing merrily; her unlackered,
ancient, third-hand tea-tray arranged with a black tea-pot,
two cups with a red and white pattern, and one with the old
friendly willow pattern, and saucers, not to match (on-one of
the extra supply, the lump of butter flourished away); all
these preparations complete, Alice began to look about her
with satisfaction, and a sort of wonder what more could be
done to add to the comfort of the evening. She took one of
the chairs away from its appropriate place by the table, and
putting it close to the broad large hanging shelf I told you
about when I first described her cellar-dwelling, and mounting
onit, she pulled towards her an old deal box, and took thence
a quantity of the oat bread of the north, the “clap-bread” of
Cumberland and Westmoreland, and descending carefully
with the thin cakes threatening to break to pieces in her hand,
she placed them on the bare table, with the belief that her
visitors would have an unusual treat in eating the bread of her
childhood. She brought out a good piece of a four-pound
loaf of common household bread as well, and then sat down to
rest, really to rest, and not to pretend, on one of the rush-
bottomed chairs. The candle was ready to be lighted, the
kettle boiled, the tea was awaiting its doom in its paper parcel ;
all was ready.

A knock at the door! It was Margaret, the young work-
woman who lived in the rooms above, who having heard the
bustle, and the subsequent quiet, began to think it was time to
pay her visit below. She was a sallow, unhealthy, sweet-
looking young woman, with a careworn look; her dress was
humble and very simple, consisting of some kind of dark stuff
gown, her neck being covered by a drab shawl or large hand-
kerchief, pinned down behind and at the sidesin front. The
old woman gave her a hearty greeting, and made her sit down
on the chair she had just left, while she balanced herself on the
board seat, in order that Margaret might think it was quite her
free and independent choice to sit there.

to think they were the golden hills of heaven, about which my
mother sang when I was a child,

‘Yon are the golden hills o’ heaven,
‘Where ye sall never win.’

Something about a ship and a lover that should hae been na
lover, the ballad was. Well, and near our cottage were rocks.
Eh, lasses! ye don’t know what rocks are in Manchester!
Gray pieces o’ stone as large as a house, all covered over wi"
mosses of different colours, some yellow, some brown; and
the ground beneath them knee deep in purple heather, smell-
ing sae sweet and fragrant, and the low music of the humming-
bee for ever sounding among it. Mother used to send Sally
and me out to gather ling and heather for besoms, and it was
such pleasant work! We used to come home of an evening
loaded so as you could not see us, for all that it was so light to

. And then mother would make us sit down under the
old hawthorn tree (where we used to make our house among
the great roots as stood above th’ ground), to pick and tie up
the heather. It séems all like yesterday, and yet it’s along long
time agone. Poor sister Sally has been in her grave this forty
year and more. But I often wonder if the hawthorn is standing
yet, and if the lasses still go to gather heather, as we did many
‘and many a year past and gone. I sicken at heart to see the
old spot once again. May be next summer I may set off, if God
spares me to see next summer.”

“Why have you never been in all these many years?”
asked Mary:

“Why iass! first one wanted me and then another; and I
couldn’t go without money either, and Igot very poor at times.
Tom was a scapegrace, poor fellow, and always wanted help
of one kind or another; and his wife (for I think scapegraces
are always married long before steady-folk) was but a helpless
kind of body. She were always ailing, and he were always
in trouble; so Thad enough to do with my hands and my
money too, for that matter. They died within twelvemonth
of each other, leaving one lad (they had had seven, but the
Lord had taken six to himself), Will, as I was telling you on;

 

36

With s faint smile, as if amused at Alice’s choice of a
song, Margaret began.

Do you know “The Oldham Weaver?” Not unless you
are Lancashire born and bred, for it is a complete Lancashire
ditty. I will copy it for you.

David.” Mary held herbresth, unwilling to lose a note,
it was so clear, so perfect, so imploring. A far more
correct musician than Mary might have paused with equal
admiration of the really scientific knowledge, with which
the poor depressed-looking young needle-woman used her
superb and flexile voice. Deborah Travis herself (once
an Oldham factory girl, and afterwards the darling of fashion-
able crowds as Mrs. Knyvett), might have owned a sister in
her art.

She stopped; and with tears of holy sympathy in her eyes,
Alice thanked the songstress, who resumed her calm, demure
manner, much to Mary’s wonder, for she looked at her un-
weariedly, as if surprised that the hidden power should not be
perceived in the outward appearance.

When Alice’s little speech of thanks was over, there was
quiet enough to hear a fine, though rather quavering, male
voice, going over again one or two strains of Margaret's song.

“That ’s grandfather!” exclaimed she. “I must be going,
for he said he should not be at home till past nine.”

“Well, I’llnot say nay, for Ihave to be up by four for a
very heavy wash at Mrs. Simpson’s; but I shall be terrible
glad to see you again at any time, lasses; and I hope you'll
take to one another.”

As the girls ran up the cellar steps together, Margaret
said: “Just step in, and see grandfather. I should like him
to see you.”

And Mary consented.

hand-loom weaver in Manchester, whom he named. Sir J. E.
Smith proceeded by boat to Manchester, and on arriving at
that town, he inquired of the porter who was carrying his
luggage if he could direct him to So and So.

“Oh, yes,” replied the man. “He does a bit in my
way ;’’ and, on further investigation, it turned out, that both
the porter, and his friend the weaver, were skilful botanists ;
and able to give Sir J. E. Smith the very information which he
wanted.

Such are the tastes and pursuits of some of the thoughtful,
little understood, working men of Manchester.

And Margaret’s grandfather was one of these. He was a
little wiry-looking old man, who moved with a jerking mo-
tion, as if his limbs were worked by a string like a child’s toy,
with dun-coloured hair lying thin and soft at the back and
sides of his head; his forehead was so large it séemed to
overbalance the rest of his face, which had, indeed, lost its
natural contour by the absence of all the teeth. The eyes
absolutely gleamed with intelligence; so keen, so observant,
you felt as if they were almost wizard-like. Indeed, the
whole room looked not unlike a wizard’s dwelling. Instead
of pictures were hung rude wooden frames of impaled insects ;
the little table was covered with cabalistic books; and beside
them lay a case of mysterious instruments, one of which Job
Legh was using when his granddaughter entered.

‘On her appearance he pushed his spectacles up so as to
rest midway on his forehead, and gave Mary a short, kind
welcome. But Margaret he caressed as a mother caresses her
first born; stroking her with tenderness, and almost altering
his voice as he spoke to her.

Mary looked round on the odd, strange things she had
never seen at home, and which seemed to her to havea very
uncanny look.

“Is your grandfather a fortune-teller?” whispered she
to her new friend.

“No,” replied Margaret, in the same voice; “but you're

were doubled up, and grandfather thought I couldn't fairly
see how big he was. So he shakes him out right before the
fire; and a good warm one it was, for I was ironing, I re-
member. I left off ironing and stooped down over him, to
look at him better, and grandfather got a book, and began to
read how this very kind were the most poisonous and vicious
species, how their bite were often fatal, and then went on to
read how people who were bitten got swelled, and screamed
with pain. I was listening hard, but as it fell out, I never
took my eyes off the creature, though I could not ha’ toldI
was watching it. Suddenly it seemed to give a jerk, and be-
fore I could speak it gave another, and in a minute it was as
wild as it could be, running at me just like a mad dog.”

“What did you do?” asked Mary.

“Me! why, I jumped first ona chair, and then on all the
things Id been ironing on the dresser, and I screamed for
grandfather to come up by me, but he did not hearken
tome.”

“Why, if 1d come up by thee, who ’d ha’ caught the crea-
ture, I should like to know?”

“Well, I begged grandfather to crush it, and I had the
iron right over it once, ready to drop, but grandfather begged
me not to hurt it in that way. So I couldn’t think what he’d
have, for he hopped round the room as if he were sore afraid,
for all he begged me not to injure it. At last he goes to
kettlo, and lifts up the lid, and peepsin. What on earth is
he doing that for, thinks I; he “ll never drink his tea with a
scorpion running free and easy about the room. Then he
takes the tongs, and he settles his spectacles on his nose, and
in a minute he had lifted the creature up by th’ leg, and
dropped him into the boiling water.”

“And did that kill him?” said Mary.

“Ay, sure enough; he boiled for longer time than grand-
fathor liked though. But I was so afeard of his coming round
again. Iran to the public-house for some gin, and grandfather
filled the bottle, and then we poured off the water, and picked

It was towards the end of February, in that year, and a
bitter black frost had lasted for many weeks. The keen east
wind had long since swept the streets clean, though on a gusty
day the dust would rise like pounded ice, and make people's
faces quite smart with the cold force with which it blew against
them. Houses, sky, people, and every thing looked as if a
gigantic brush had washed them all over with a dark shade of
Indian ink. There was some reason for this grimy appearance
on human beings, whatever there might be for the dun looks
of the landscape; for soft water had become an article not
even to be purchased; and the poor washerwomen might be
seen vainly trying to procure a little by breaking the thick gray
ice that coated the ditches and ponds in the neighbourhood.
Peopleprophesied a long continuance to this already lengthen
ed frost; said the spring would be very late; no spring
fashions required; no summer clothing purchased for a short
uncertain summer. Indeed there was no end to the evil pro-
phesied during the continuance of that bleak east wind.

Mary hurried home one evening, just as daylight was
fading, from Miss Simmonds’, with her shawl held up to her
mouth, and her head bent as if in deprecation of the meeting
wind. So she did not perceive Margaret till she was close
upon her at the very turning into the court.

“Bless me Margaret! is that you? Where are you bound to?”

“To nowhere butyour own house (that is, if you'll take me
in). I’ve a job of work to finish to-night; mourning, as must
bé in time for the funeral to-morrow; and grandfather has
been out moss-hunting, and will not be home till late.”

“Oh, how charming it will be. I'll help you if you’re
backward. Have you much to do?”

“Yes, I only get the order yesterday at noon; and there's
three girls beside the mother; and what with trying on and
matching the stuff (for there was not enough in the piece they
chose first), I’m above a bit behindhand. I’ve the skirts all to
make; I kept that work till candlelight; and the sleeves, to
say nothing of little bits to the bodies; for the missis is very
particular, and I could scarce keep from smiling while they

“] thought you said she was but badly off,” said Mary.

“Ay, [know she’s asked for credit at several places, saying
her husband laid hands on every farthing he could get for
drink. But th’ undertakers urge her on you see, and tell her
this thing’s usual, and that thing ’s only a common mark of
respect, and that every body has t’other thing, till the poor
woman has no will o’ her own. I dare say, too, her heart
strikes\her (it always does when a person ’s gone) for many a
word and many a slighting deed to him, who's stiff and cold;
and she thinks to make up matters, as it were, by a grand
funeral, though she and all her children, too, may have to
pinch many a year to pay the expenses, if ever they pay them
atall.”

“This mourning, too, will cost a pretty penny,” said Mary.
“T often wonder why folks wear mourning; it’s not pretty or
becoming; and it costs a deal of money just when people can
spare it least; and if what the Bible tells us be true, we ought
not to be sorry when a friend, who’s been good, goes to his
rest; and as for a bad man, one’s glad enough to get shut* on
him. I cannot see what good comes o’ wearing mourning.”

“I'll tell you what I think th’ fancy was sent for (Old Alice
calls every thing ‘sent for,’ and I believe she ’s right). It does
do good, thought not as much as it costs, that I do believe, in
setting people (as is cast down by sorrow and feels themselves
unable to settle to anything but crying) something to do.
Why now I told you how they were grieving; for, perhaps, he
was a kind husband and father, in his thoughtless way, when he
wasn’t in liquor. But they cheered up wonderful while I was
there, and I asked ’em for more directions than usual, that they
might have something to talk over and fix about; and I left
’em my fashion-book (though it were two months old) just a
purpose.”

“I don’t think every one would grieve a that way. Old
Alice wouldn’t.”

“Old Alice is one in athousand. I doubt, too, if she would
fret much, however sorry she might be. She would say it were

so heavy a weight would of itself be a great and imminent
danger.

“Help me! she’s fainted,” cried Margaret. But no one
heeded. All eyes were directed upwards. At this point of
time a rope, with a running noose, was dexterously thrown
by one of the firemen, after the manner of alasso, over the
hhead and round the bodies of the two men. True, it was
with rude and slight adjustment: but, slight as it was, it
served as a steadying guide; it encouraged the sinking heart,
the dizzy head. Once more Jem stepped onwards. He was
not burried by any jerk or pull. Slowly and gradually the
rope was hauled in, slowly and gradually did he make the
four or five paces between him and safety. The window was
gained, and all were saved. The multitude in the street ab-
solutely danced with triumph, and huzzaed and yelled till you
would have fancied their very throats would crack; and then,
with all the fickleness of interest characteristic of a large body
of people, pressed and stumbled, and cursed and swore, in
‘the hurry to get out of Dunham Street, and back to the imme-
diate scene of the fire, the mighty diapason of whose roaring
flames formed an awful accompaniment to the screams, and
yells, and imprecations, of the struggling crowd.

As they pressed away, Margaret was left, pale and almost
sinking under the weight of Mary's body, which she had pre-
served in an upright position by keeping her arms tight round
Mary’s waist, dreading, with reason, the trampling of un-
heeding feet.

Now, however, she gently let her down on the cold clean
pavement; and the change of posture, and the difference
in temperature, now that the people had withdrawn from
their close neighbourhood, speedily restored her to con-
sciousness.

Her first glance was bewildered and uncertain. She hac
forgotten where she was. Her cold, hard bed felt strange
the murky glare in the sky affrighted her. She shut her eyer
to think, to recollect,

When it was ended he swore (an unusual thing for him)
that if Jem Wilson wanted Mary he should have her to-mor-
row, if he had not a penny to keep her.

Margaret laughed, but Mary, who was now recovered
from her agitation, pouted and looked angry.

The work which they had left was resumed: but with full
hearts, fingers never go very quickly; and I am sorry to say,
that owing to the fire, the two younger Miss Ogdens were in
such grief for the loss of their excellent father, that they were
unable to appear before the little circle of sympathising friends
gathered together to comfort the widow, and see the funeral
set off.

Joun Barton was not far wrong in his idea that the
Messrs. Carsons would not be over-much grieved for the con-
sequences of the fire in their mill. They were well insured;
the machinery lacked the improvements of late years, and
worked but poorly in comparison with that which might now
be procured. Above all, trade was very slack; cottons could
find no market, and goods lay packed and piled in many a
warehouse. The mills were merely worked to keep the ma-
chinery, human and metal, in some kind of-order and readi-

got; and taking off his coat he covered them with it as well
as he could. He pulled her feet to the fire, which now began
to emit some faint heat. He looked round for water, but the
poor woman had been too weak to drag herself out to the
distant pump, and water there was none. He snatched the
child, and ran up the area-steps to the room above, and bor-
rowed their only saucepan with some water in it. ‘Then he
began, with the useful skill of a working-man, to make some
gruel; and when it was hastily made, he seized a battered iron
table-spoon (kept when many other little things had been sold
in a lot), in order to feed baby, and with it he forced one or
two drops between her clenched teeth. The mouth opened
mechanically to receive more, and gradually she revived. She
sat up and looked round; and recollecting all, fell down again
in weak and passive despair. Her little child crawled to her,
and wiped with its fingers the thick-coming tears which she
now had strength to weep. It was now high time to attend to
the man. He lay on straw, so damp and mouldy, no dog
would have chosen it in preference to flags; over it was a
piece of sacking, coming next to his worn skeleton of a body;
above him was mustered every article of clothing that could
be spared by mother or children this bitter weather; and in
addition to his own, these might have given as much warmth
as one blanket, could they have been kept onhim; but as he
restlessly tossed to and fro, they fell off and left him shivering
in spite of the burning heat of his sl Every now and then
he started up in his naked madness, looking like the prophet
of woe in the fearful plague-picture; but he soon fell again in
exhaustion, and Barton found he must be closely watched,
lest in these falls he should injure himself against the hard
brick floor. He was thankful when Wilson reappeared,
carrying in both hands a jug of steaming tea, intended for the
poor wife; but when the delirious husband saw drink, he
snatched at it with animal instinct, with a selfishness he had
never shown in health.

‘Then the two men consulted together. It seemed decided.

could na’ read hersel. It were as good as Bible-words; ne’er
awordo’ repining; a’ about God being our father, and that
we mun bear patiently whate’er he sends.””

“Don ye think he’s th’ masters’ father, too? I'd be loth
to have ’em for brothers.”

“Eh, John! donna talk so; sure there’s many and many &
master as good or better nor us.””

“Ifyou think so, tell me this. How comes it they ’re rich,
and we're poor? I'd like to know that. Han they done as
they ’d be done for by us?”

But Wilson was no arguer; no speechifier, as he would
have calledit. So Barton, seeing he was likely to have it his
own way, went on.

“You'll say (at least many a one does), they’n* getten
capital an’ we’n getten none. I say, our labour ’s our capital
and we ought to draw interest on that. They get interest on
their capital somehow a’ this time, while ourn is lying idle,
else how could they all live as they do? Besides, there’s many
on 'em has had nought to begin wi’; there’s Carsons, and
Duncombes, and Mengies, and many another, as comed into
Manchester, with clothes to their back, and that were all, and
now they’re worth their tens of thousands, a’ getten out of
our labour; why the very land as fetched but sixty pound
twenty year agone is now worth six hundred, and that, too,
is owing to our labour: but look at yo, and see me, and poor

us down to th’ lowest peg, in order to make their great big
fortunes, and build their great big houses, and we, why we 're
just clemming, many and many of us, Can you say there's
nought wrong in this?”

“Well, Barton, I'll not gainsay ye. But Mr. Carsons spoke
to me afterth’ fire, and says he, ‘I hall ha’ to retrench, and
be very careful in my expenditure during these bad times, I
assure ye;’ so yo see th’ masters suffer too.”

preparations for breakfast; but good-naturedly, though
hastily, told him to step in, and they could soon letMr.Carsons
know he was there. So he was ushered into a kitchen hung
round with glittering tins, where a roaring fire burnt merrily,
and where numbers of utensils hung round, at whose nature
and use Wilson amused himself by guessing. Meanwhile, the
servants bustled to and fro; an out-door man-servant came in
for orders, and sat down near Wilson. The cook broiled
steaks, and the kitchen-maid toasted bread, and boiled

The coffee steamed upon the fire, and altogether the
odours were so mixed and appetizing, that Wilson began to
yearn for food to break his fast, which had lasted since dinner
the day before. If the servants had known this, they would
have willingly given him meat and bread in abundance; but
they were like the rest of us, and not feeling hunger them-
selves, forgot it was possible another might. So Wilson’s
craving turned to sickness, while they chatted on, making the
kitchen’s free and keen remarks upon the parlour.

“How late you were last night, Thomas?”

“Yes, Iwas right weary of waiting; they told me to be at
the rooms by twelve; and thereI was. But it was two o’clock
before they called me.”

“And did you wait all that time in the street?” asked the
housemaid, who had done her work for the present, and come
into the kitchen for a bit of gossip.

“My eye as like! you don’t think I’m such a fool as to
catch my death of cold, and let the horses catch their death
too, as weshould ha’ done if we'd stopped there. No! Iput
th’ horses up in th’ stables at th’ Spread Eagle, and went my-
sel’, and got a’glass or two by th’ fire. They ’re driving a
good custom, them, wi’ coachmen. There were five on us,
and we’d many a quart o’ ale, and gin wi’ it, to keep out
cold. ””

“Mercy onus, Thomas; youll get a drunkard at last!””

“Tf Ido, I know whose blame it willbe. It will be mis-

daughter of the house, a lovely girl of sixteen, fresh and
glowing, and bright asa rosebud. She was too young to go
to assemblies, at which her father rejoiced, for he had little
Amy with her pretty jokes, and her bird-like songs, and her
playful caresses all the evening to amuse him in his loneliness ;
and she was not too much tired, like Sophy and Helen, to
give him her sweet company at breakfast the next morning.

He submitted willingly while she blinded him with her
hands, and kissed his rough red face all over. She took his
newspaper away after a little pretended resistance, and would
not allow her brother Harry to go on with his review.

“I'm the only lady this morning, papa, so you know you
must make a great deal of me.”

“My darling, I think you have your own way always,
whether you ’re the only lady or not.”

“Yes, papa, you're pretty good and obedient, I must say
that; but I’m sorry to say Harry is very naughty, and does
not do what I tell him; do you, Harry?”

“I’m sure I don’t know what you mean to accuse me of,
Amy; Lexpected praise and not blame; for did not I get you
that eau de Portugal from town, that you could not meet with
at Hughes’, you little ungrateful puss?”

“Did you? Ob, sweet Harry; you're as sweet as eau de
Portugal yourself; you ’re almost as good as papa; but still
you know you did go and forget to ask Bigland for that rose,
that new rose they say he has got.”

“No, Amy, I did not forget. Iasked him, and he has got
the Rose, sans reproche; but do you know, little Miss Extra-
vagance, a very small one is half'a guinea?”

“Oh, Idon’t mind. Papa will give itme, won't you, dear
father? He knows his little daughter can’t live without
flowers and scents.”

Mr. Carsons tried to refuse his darling, but she coaxed
him into acquiescence, saying she must have it, it was
one of her necessaries. Life was not worth having without
flowers.

 

76

Meanwhile, the younger Mr. Carsons had ended his re-
view, and began to listen to what was going on. He finished
his breakfast, got up, and pulled five shillings out of his
pocket, which he gave to Wilson as he passed him, for the
“poor fellow.” He went past quickly, and calling for his
horse, mounted gaily, and rode away. He was anxious to be
in time to have a look and a smile from lovely Mary Barton, ag
she went to Miss Simmonds’. But to-day he was to be dis-
appointed. Wilson left the house, not knowing whether to be
pleased or grieved. They had all spoken kindly to him, and
who could tell if they might not inquire into Davenport’s case,
and do something for him and his family. Besides, the cook,
who, when she had had time to think, after breakfast was
sentin, had noticed his paleness, had had meat and bread
ready to put in his hand when he came out of the parlour; and
a fall stomach makes every one of us more hopeful.

When he reached Berry Street, he had persuaded himself
he bore good news, and felt almost elated in his heart. Butit
fell when he opened the cellar-door, and saw Barton and the
wife both bending over the sick man’s couch with awe-struck,
saddened look.

“Come here,” said Barton. “There ’s a change comed
over him sin’ yo left, is there not?”

Wilson looked. The flesh was sunk, the features pro-
minent, bony, and rigid. The fearful clay-colour of death
was overall. But the eyes were open and sensitive, though
the films of the grave were setting upon them.

“He wakened fra his sleep, as yo left him in, and began to
mutter and moan; but he soon went off again, and we never
knew he were awake till he called his wife, but now she ’s here
he’s gotten nought to say to her.”

Most probably, as they all felt, he could not speak, for
his strength was fast ebbing. ‘They stood round him still and
silent; even the wife checked her sobs, though her heart was
like to break. She held her child to her breast, to try and
keep him quiet. Their eyes were all fixed on the yet living
one, whose moments of life were passing so rapidly away. At

anger, in the anxious desire to comfort the poor lone woman.
Never had her sweet face looked more angelic, never had her
gentle voice seemed so musical as when she murmured her
broken sentences of comfort.

“Oh, don’t cry so, dear Mrs. Davenport, pray don’t take
on so. Sure he’s gone where he'll never know care again.
Yes, Iknow how lonesome you must feel; but think of your
children. Oh! we 'Il all help to earn food for ’em. Think
how sorry he’d be, ifhe sees you fretting so. Don’t cry so,
please don’t.”

‘And she ended by crying herself as passionately as the
poor widow.

Tt was agreed the town must bury him; he had paid to
a burial club as long as he could, but by a few weeks’ omis-
sion, he had forfeited his claim to a sum of money now.
Would Mrs. Davenport and the little child go home with
Mary? The latter brightened up as she urged this plan; but
no! where the poor, fondly loved remains were, there would
the mourner be; and all that they could do was to make her as
comfortable as their funds would allow, and to beg a neigh-
bour to look in and say a word at times. So she was left alone
with her dead, and they went to work that had work, and
he who had none, took upon him the arrangements for the
funeral.

Mary had many a scolding from Miss Simmonds that day
for her absence of mind. To be sure Miss Simmonds was
much put out by Mary’s non-appearance in the morning with
certain bits of muslin, and shades of silk which were wanted to
complete adress to be worn that night; but it was true enough
that Mary did not mind what she was about; she was too busy
planning how her old black gown (her best when her mother
died) might be spunged, and turned, and lengthened into
something like decent mourning for the widow. And when
she went home at night (though it was very late, asa sort of
retribution for her morning’s negligence), she set to work at
once, and was so busy and so glad over her task, that she had,
every now and then, to check herself in singing merry ditties,

 

 

80

shillings beforehand with the world. She determined to flit
from that cellar to another less full of painful associations,
leas haunted by mournful memories. The board, not so for-
midable as she had imagined, had inquired into her case;
and, instead of sending her to Stoke Claypole, her husband’s
Buckinghamshire parish, as she had dreaded, had agreed to
pay her rent. So food for four mofths was all she was now
required to find; only for three she would have said; for her-
self, and the unweaned child were but reckoned as one in her
calculation.

She had a strong heart, now her bodily strength had
been recruited by a week or two of food, and she would not
despair. So she took in some little children to nurse, who
brought their daily food with them, which she cooked for
them, without wronging their helplessness of a crumb; and
when she had restored them to their mother’s at night, she
set to work at plain sewing, “seam, and gusset, and band,”
and sat thinking how she might best cheat the factory in-
spector, and persuade him that her strong, big, hungry Ben,
was above thirteen. Her plan of living was so far arranged,
when she heard, with keen sorrow, that Wilson's twin lads
were ill of the fever.

They had never been strong. They were like many a pair
of twins, and seemed to have but one life divided between
them. One life, one strength, and in this instance, I might
almost say, one brain; for they were helpless, gentle, silly
children, but not the less dear to their parents and to their
strong, active, manly, elder brother. They were late on
their feet, late in talking, late every way; had to be nursed
and cared for when other lads of their age were tumbling
about in the street, and losing themselves, and being taken
to the police-office miles away from home.

Still want had never yet come in at the door to make love,
for these innocents fly out of the window. Nor was this the
case even now, when Jem Wilson's earnings, and his
mother’s occasional charrings were barely sufficient to give
all the family their fll of food.

 

where hope there was none. Mary stepped slowly and lightly
across to Alice.

“Ay, poorlad! God has taken him early, Mary.”

Mary could not speak; she did not know what to say; it
was so much worse than she had expected. At last she ven-
tured to whisper,

“Ts there any chance for the other one, think you?”

Alice shook her head, and told with a look that she be-
lieved there was none. She next endeavoured to lift the little
body, and carry it to its old-accustomed bed in its parent’s
room. But earnest as the father was in watching the yet-
living, he had eyes and ears for all that concerned the dead,
and sprang gently up, and took his dead son on his hard
couch in his arms with tender strength, and carried him up-
stairs as if afraid o’ wakening him.

‘The other child gasped longer, louder, with more of
effort.

“We mun get him away from his mother. He cannot die
while she’s wishing him.”

“Wishing him?” said Mary, in atone of inquiry.

“Ay; donno’ ye know what wishing mean? There ’s none
can die in the arms of those who are wishing them sore to
stay on earth. The soul o’ them as holds them won’t let the
dying soul go free; so it has a hard struggle for the quiet of
death. We mun get him away fra’ his mother, or he'll have
ahard death, poor lile* fellow.”

So without circumlocution she went and offered to take
the sinking child. But the mother would not let him go, and
looking in Alice’s face with brimming and imploring eyes,
declared in earnest whispers, that she was not wishing him,
that she would fain have him released from his suffering.
Alice and Mary stood by with eyes fixed on the poor child,
whose struggles seemed to increase, till at last his mother
said with a choking voice,

He let her hand go, and she quickly went away to Alice’s
» side.

“Fool that I was — nay, wretch that I was — to let myself *
take this time of trouble to tell her how I loved her; no
wonder that she turns away from such a selfish beast.”

Partly to relieve her from his presence, and partly from
natural desire, and partly, perhaps, from a penitent wish to
share to the utmost his parents’ sorrow, he soon went up-
stairs to the chamber of death.

mechanically helped Alice in all the duties she per-
formed through the remainder of that long night, but she
did not see Jem again. He remained up-stairs until after the
early dawn showed Mary that she need have no fear of going
home through the deserted and quiet streets, to try and get a
little sleep before work-hour. So leaving kind messages to
George and Jane Wilson, and hesitating whether she might
dare to send a few kind words to Jem, and deciding that she
had better not, she stepped out into the bright morning light,
so fresh a contrast to the darkened room where death had
been.

“They bad
Another morn than ours.”

Mary lay down on her bed in her clothes; and whether it
was this, or the broad daylight that poured in through the sky
window, or whether it was over-excitement, it was long before
she could catch a wink of sleep. Her thoughts ran on Jem’s
manner and words; not but what she had known the tale they
told for many a day; but still she wished he had not put itso
plainly.

“Oh dear,” said she to herself, “I wish he would not mis-
take me so ; I never dare to speak a common word o’ kindness,
but his eye brightens and his check flushes. It’s very hard on.
me; for father and George Wilson are old friends; and Jem
and I ha’ known each other since we were quite children. I
cannot think what possesses me, that I must always be wanting
to comfort him when he ’s downcast, and that I must go med-
dling wi? him to-night, when sare enough it was his aunt’s

leaven, infused, years ago by her aunt Esther, fermented in her
little bosom, and perhaps all the more for her father’s aver-
sion to the rich and the gentle. Such is the contrariness of
the human heart, from Eve downwards, that we all, in our old
Adam state, fancy things forbidden sweetest. So Mary dwelt
upon and enjoyed the idea of some day becoming a lady, and
doing all the elegant nothings appertaining to ladyhood. It
was a comfort to her, when scolded by Miss Simmonds, to
think of the day when she would drive up to the door in her
own carriage, to order her gowns from the hasty-tempered yet
kind dressmaker. It was a pleasure to her to hear the general
admiration of the two elder Miss Carsons, acknowledged beau-
ties in ball-room and street, on horseback and on foot, and to
think of the time when she should ride and walk with them in
loving sisterhood. But the best of her plans, the holiest, that
which in some measure redeemed the vanity of the rest, were
those relating to her father; her dear father, now oppressed
with care, and always a disheartened, gloomy person. How
she would surround him with every comfort she could devise
(of course, he was to live with them); till he should acknow-
ledge riches to be very pleasant things, and bless his lady-
daughter! Every one who had shown her kindness in her low
estate should then be repaid a hundred-fold.

Such were the castles in the air, the Alnaschar-visions in
which Mary indulged, and which she was doomed in after days
to expiate many tears.

Meanwhile, her words—or, even more, her tones—would
maintain their hold on Jem Wilson’s memory. A thrill would
yet come over him when he remembered how her hand had
rested on his arm. The thought of her mingled with all his
grief, and it was profound, for the loss of his brothers.

CHAPTER VII.

“Deal gently, with them, they have much endured,

Scoff not at their fond hopes and earnest plans,

Though they may seem to thee wild dreams and fancies.

Perchance, in the rough school of stern experience,

‘They 've something learned which Theory does not teach ;

Or if they greatly err, deal gently still,

And let their error but the stronger plead

“Give us the light and guidance that we need
‘Love Taove!

One Sunday afternoon, about three weeks after that
mournful night, Jem Wilson set out with the ostensible pur-
pose of calling on John Barton. He was dressed in his best,
his Sunday suit of course; while his face glittered with the
scrubbing he had bestowed on it. His dark black hair had
been arranged and re-arranged before the household looking-
glass, and in his button-hole he stuck a narcissus (a sweet
Nancy is its pretty Lancashire name), hoping it would attract
Mary’s notice, sothat he mighthave the delight of giving ither.

Tt was a bad beginning of his visit of happiness that Mary
saw him some minutes before he came into her father’s house.
She was sitting at the end of the dresser, with the little window-
blind drawn on one side, in order that she might see the
passers-by, in the intervals of reading her Bible, which lay
open before her. So she watched all the greeting a friend
gave Jem; she saw the face of condolence, the sympathetic
shake of the hand, and had time to arrange her own face and
manner before Jem came in, which he did, as if he had eyes for
no one but her father, who sat smoking his pipe by the fire,
while he read an old “‘Nothern Star,” borrowed from a neigh-
bouring public-house.

‘Then he turned to Mary, who, he felt by the sure instinct of
love, by which almost his body thought, was present. Her
hands were busy adjusting her dress; a forced and unnecessary
movement Jem could not help thinking. Her accost was
quiet and friendly, if grave; she felt that she reddened like a
rose, and wished she could prevent it, while Jem wondered if
her blushes arose from fear, or anger, or love.

 

 

90

She was very cunning, Iam afraid. She pretended to read
diligently, and not to listen to a word that was said, while in
fact she heard all sounds, even to Jem’s long, deep sighs,
which' wrung her heart. At last she took up her Bible, and
as if their conversation disturbed her, went up-stairs to her
little room. And she had scarcely spoken a word to Jem;
scarcely looked at him; never noticed his beautiful sweet
Nancy, which only awaited her least word of praise to be hers!
He did not know—that pang was spared—that in her little
dingy bed-room, stood a white jug, filled with » luxuriant
bunch of early spring roses, making the whole room fragrant
and bright. They were the gift of herricher lover. SoJem
had to go on sitting with John Barton, fairly caught in his own
trap, and had to listen to his talk, and answer him as best he
might.

“There’s the right stuff in this here ‘Star,’ and no mistake.
Such aright-down piece for short hours.”

“ At the same rate of wages as now?” asked Jem.

“Ay, ay! else where’s the use? It’s only taking out o”
the master’s pocket what they can well afford. Did I ever tell
yo what th’ Infirmary chap let me into, many a year agone?”

“No,” said Jem, listlessly.

“Well! yo must know I were in th’ Infirmary for a fever,
and times were rare and bad, and there be good chaps there to
a man, while he ’s wick,* whate’er they may be about cutting
him up at after.** So when I were better o’ th’ fever, but.

may stay in a week longer, and help our surgeon wi’ sorting his
papers; and we'll take care yo ’ve your belly fully of meat and
drink. Yo ’ll be twice as strong in a week.’ So there wanted
but one word to that bargain. So I were set to writing and
copying; th’ writing I could do well enough, but they ’dsuch

to record their sufferings. And yet even his words would fall
short of the awful truth; they could only present an outline of
the tremendous facts of the destitution that surrounded thou-
sands upon thousands in the terrible years 1839, 1840, and
1841. Even philanthropists who had studied the subject were
forced to own themselves perplexed in the endeavour to as-
certain the real causes of the misery; the whole matter was of
so complicated a nature, that it became next to impossible to
understand it thoroughly. It need excite no surprise then to
learn that a bad feeling between working-men and the upper
classes became very strong in this season of privation. The
indigence and sufferings of the operatives induced a suspicion
in the minds of many of them, that their legislators, their
magistrates, their employers, and even the ministers of re-
ligion, were, in general, their oppressors and enemies; and
were, in league for their prostration and enthralment.
‘The most deplorable and enduring evil that arose out of the
period of commercial depression to which I refer, was this
feeling of alienation between the different classes of society.
Itis so impossible to describe, or even faintly to picture, the
state of distress which prevailed in the town at that time, that
I will not attempt it; and yet I think again that surely, ina
Christian land, it was not known even so feebly as words could
tell it, or the more happy and fortunate would have thronged
with their sympathy and their aid. In many instances the
sufferers wept first, and then they cursed. Their vindictive
feelings exhibited themselves in rabid politics. And whenI
hear, as Ihave heard, of the sufferings and privations of the
poor, of provision-shops where ha'porths of tea, sugar, butter,
and even flour, were sold to accommodate the indigent, —
of parents sitting in their clothes by the fire-side during the
whole night for seven wecks together, in order that their only
bed and bedding might be reserved for the use of their large
family, — of others sleeping upon the cold hearth-stone for
weeks in succession, without adequate means of providing
themselves with food or fuel (and this in the depth of winter),
— of others being compelled to fast for days together, un-

that went a little further ; and last, there was the really pure
gladness of heart arising from the idea that he was one of those
chosen to be instruments in making known the distresses of
the people, and consequently in procuring them some grand
relief, by means of which they should never suffer want or care
any more. He hoped largely, but vaguely, of the results of
his expedition. An argosy of the precious hopes of many
otherwise despairing creatures, was that petition to be heard
concerning their sufferings.

The night before the morning on which the Manchester
delegates were to leave for London, Barton might be said to
hold a levée, so many neighbours came dropping in. Job
Legh had early established himself and his pipe by John Bar-
ton’s fire, not saying much, but puffing away, and imagining
himself of use in adjusting the smoothing-irons that hung
before the fire, ready for Mary when she should want them.
As for Mary, her employment was the same as that of Beau
‘Tibbs’ wife, “Just washing her father’s two shirts,”’ in the
pantry back-kitchen; for she was anxious about his appear-
anceinLondon. (The coat had been redeemed, though the
silk handkerchief was forfeited.) ‘The door stood open, as
usual, between the houseplace and back-kitchen, so she gave
her greeting to their friends as they entered.

“So, John, yo’re bound for London, are yo?” said
one.

“Ay, Isuppose Imun go,” answered John, yielding to
necessity as it were.

“Well, there ’s many a thing I'd like yo to speak on to the
parliament people. Thou lt not spare’em, John, L hope.
‘Tell’em our minds; how we ’re thinking we ’ve been clemmed
long enough, and we donnot see whatten good they ’n been
doing, if they can’t give us what we ’re all crying for sin’ the
day we were born.”

“Ay, ay! I'll tell’em that, and much more to it, when it
gets to my turn; but thou knows there ’s many will have their
word afore me.”

“Well, thou ‘It speak at last. Bless thee, lad, do ask’em

Sankey’s little rittling* of alad, as works till he cries for his
legs aching so, though he is right age, and better.”

“I’ve one plan I wish to tell John Barton,” said a pom-
pous, careful-speaking man, “and I should like him for to lay
it afore the honourable house. My mother comed out! o’ Ox-
fordshire, and were under-laundry-maid in Sir Francis Dash-
wood’s family; and when we were little ones, she'd tell us
stories of their grandeur: and one thing she named were, that
Sir Francis wore two shirts a day. Now he were all as one as
a parliament man; and many on’em, Ihan no doubt, are like
extravagant. Just tell ’em John, do, that they ’d be doing
the Lancashire weavers a great kindness, if they ’d ha’ their
shirts a’ made o’ calico; ’t would make trade brisk, that would,
wi’ the power o’ shirts they wear.”

Job Legh now put in his word. Taking the pipe out of his
mouth, and addressing the last speaker, he sai

“I'll tell ye what, Bill, and no offence mind ye; there's
but hundreds of them parliament folk as wear so many shirts
to their back; but there ’s thousands and thousands 0’ poor
weavers as han only gotten one shirt i’ th’ world; ay, and
don’t know where t’ get another when that rag’s done, though
they ’re turning out miles 0’ calico every day; and many 0’
mile o’t is lying in warehouses, stopping up trade for want 0°
purchasers. Yo take my advice, John Barton, and ask par-
Tiament to set trade free, so as workmen can earn a decent
wage, and buy their two, ay and three, shirts a-year; that
would make weaving brisk.”

‘He pat his pipe in his mouth again, and redoubled his puff-
ing to make up for lost time.

“I’m afeard, neighbours,” said John Barton, “I’ve not
much chance o’ telling ’em all yo say; what I think on, is just
speaking out about the distress, that they say is nought. When
they hear o’ children born on wet flags, without a rag t’ cover
"em, or a bit 0’ food for th’ mother; when they hear of folk

hopes for the future. Mary watched him set off, with her
hands over her eyes to shade them from the bright slanting
rays of the morning sun, and then she turned into the house to
arrange its disorder before going to her work. She wondered
if she should like or dislike the evening and morning solitude;
for several hours when the clock struck she thought of her
father, and wondered where he was; she made good reso-
lutions according to her lights; and by-and-bye came the
distractions and events of the broad full day to occupy her
with the present, and to deaden the memory of the absent.

One of Mary's resolutions was, that she would not be per-
suaded or induced to see Mr. Harry Carsons during her
father's absence. There was something crooked in her con-
science after all; for this very resolution seemed an acknow-
ledgment that it was wrong to meet him at any time; and yet
she had brought herself to think her conduct quite innocent
and,proper, for although unknown to her father, and certain,
even did he know it, to fail of obtaining his sanction, she
esteemed her love-meetings with Mr. Carsons as sure to end
in her father’s good and happiness. But now that he was away,
she would do nothing that he would disapprove of; no, not
even though it was for his own good in the end.

Now, amongst Miss Simmonds’ young ladies was one, who
had been from the beginning a confidante in Mary’s love affair,
made so by Mr. Carsons himself. He had felt the necessity of *
some third person to carry letters and messages, and to plead
his case when he was absent. In a girl named Sally Leadbitter
he had found a willing advocate. She would have been
willing to have embarked in a love-affair herself (especially a
clandestine one), for the mere excitement of the thing; but her
willingness was strengthened by sundry half-sovereigns,
which from time to time Mr. Carsons bestowed upon her.

Sally Leadbitter was vulgar-minded to the last degree;
never easy unless her talk was of love and lovers; in her eyes
it was an honour to have had along list of wooers. So con-
stituted, it was a pity that Sally herself was but a plain, red-
haired, freckled, girl; never likely, one would have thought,

 

100

which Sally was to back with all her powers of persuasion.
After parting from him she determined, as it was not so very
late, to go at once to Mary’s, and deliverthemessage and letter.

She found Mary in great sorrow. She had just heard of
George Wilson’s sudden death: her old friend, her father’s
friend, Jem’s father — all his claims came rushing upon her.
Though not guarded from unnecessary sight or sound of
death, as the children of the rich are, yet it had so often been
brought home to her this last three or four months. It was so
terrible thus to see friend after friend depart. Her father,
too, who had dreaded Jane Wilson’s death the evening before
he set off. And she, the weakly, was left behind while the
strong man was taken, At any rate the sorrow her father
had so feared for him was spared. Such were the thoughts
which came over her.

She could not go to comfort the bereaved, even if comfort
were in her power to give; for she had resolved to avoid Jem;
and she felt that this of all others was not the occasion on
which she could keep up 8 studiously cold manner.

And in this shock of grief, Sally Leadbitter was the last
person she wished to see. However, she rose to welcome her,
betraying her tear-swollen face.

“Well, I shall tell Mr. Carsons to-morrow how you re fret-
ting for him; it’s no more nor he’s doing for you, I can
tell you.”

“For him, indeed|” said Mary, with a toss of her pretty
head.

“Ay, Miss, for him! You ’ve been sighing as if your heart
would break now for several days, over your work; now,
arn’t you a little goose not to go and see one who I am sure
loves you as his life, and whom you love; ‘How much, Mary?”
“This much,’ as the children say’ (opening her arms very
wide).

“Nonsense,” said Mary, pouting; “I often think I don’t
love him at all.”

“And I’m to tell him that, am I, next time see him?”
asked Sally.

 

 

162. -

“My eye! as if I didn’t know you did know and did
care.”

“Well, give it me,” said Mary, impatiently, land anxious in
her present mood for her visitor's departure.

Sally relinquished it unwillingly. She had, however,
the pleasure of seeing Mary dimple and blush as she read
the letter, which seemed to say the wiiter was not indifferent
to her.

“You must tell him I can’t come,” said Mary, raising
her eyes at last. ‘I have said I won’t mect him while father
is away, and I won't.”

“But Mary, he does so look for you. You'd be quite
sorry for him, he ’s so put out about not secing you. Besides,
you go when your father’s athome, without letting on* to
hhim, and what harm would there be in going now?”

“Well, Sally, you know my answer, I won't; and I
won't,”

“I'll tell him to come and see you himself some evening,
instead o’ sending me; he’d may be find you not so hard to
deal with.”

Mary flashed up.

“Tf he dares to come here while father ’s away, I'll call the
neighbours in to turn him out, so don’t be putting him up
to that.”

“Mercy on us! one would think you were the first girl that
ever had a lover; have you never heard what other girls do
and think no shame of?”

“Hush, Sally! that ’s Margaret Jenkins at the door.”

And in an instant Margaret was in the room. Mary had
begged Job Legh to let her come and sleep with her. Inthe
uncertain fire-light you could not help noticing that she had
the groping walk of a blind person.

“Well, Imust go, Mary,” said Sally. “And that’s your
last word?”

“Yes, yes; good night.” She shut the door gladly on her
unwelcome visitor — unwelcome at that time at least.

* “Letting on,” informing.

how there never was a new singer so applauded (for they ’d
clapped and stamped after 1’d done, till I began to wonder
how many pair o’ shoes they’d get through a week at that rate,
let alone their hands). So I’m to sing again o’ Thursday;
and I got a sovereign last night, and am to have half-a-
sovereign every night th’ lecturer is at th’ Mechanics.”

“Well, Margaret, I'm right glad to hear it.”

“And I don’t think you've heard the best bit yet. Now
that a way seemed opened to me, of not being a burden to
any one, though it did please God to make me blind, I
thought I’d tell grandfather. I only tell’d him about the
singing and the sovereign last night, for I thought I’d not
send him to bed wi’ a heavy heart; but this morning I telled
him all.”

“ And how did he take it?”

“He’s not a man of many words; and it took him by sur-
prise like.”

“I wonder at that; I’ve noticed itin your ways ever since
you telled me.”

“Ay, that’sit! IfI’dnottelled you, and you ’d seen me
every day, you'd not ha’ noticed the little mite o’ difference
fra’ day to day.”

“Well, but what did your grandfather say?”

“Why, Mary,” said Margaret, half smiling, “I’m a bit
loth to tell yo, for unless yo knew grandfather's ways like me,
yo’d think it strange. He was taken by surprise, and he
said: ‘Damn yo!’ Then he began looking at his book as it
were, and were very quiet, while I telled him all about it;
howI’d feared, and how downcast I’d been; and how I were
now reconciled to it, if it were th’ Lord’s will; and how I
hoped to earn money by singing; and while I were talking,
I saw great big tears come dropping on th’ book; but in
course I never let on thatI saw ’em. Dear grandfather! and
all day long he’s been quietly moving things out o’ my way, a8
he thought might trip me up, and putting things in my way as
he thought I might want; never knowing I saw and felt what he

 

106

‘What a single word can do!
Thrilling all the heart-strings through ,
Calling forth fond memori
Raining round hope’s melodies,
Steeping all in one bright hue —
What a single word can do!’

Now it falls into th’ minor key, and must be very sad like. I
feel as if I could do that better than t’other.

 

    

 

‘What a single word can do!
Making life seem all untruc,
Driving joy and hope away,
Leaving not one cheering ray,

 

Margaret certainly made the most of this little song. As
8 factory worker, listening outside, observed, “She spun it
reet* fine!”’ And if she only sang it at the Mechanics’ with
half the feeling she put into it that night, the lecturer must
have been hard to please, if he did not admit that his ex-
pectations were more than fulfilled.

When it was ended, Mary’s looks told more than words
could have done what she thought of it; and partly to keep
in a tear which would fain have rolled out, she brightened into
alaugh, and said, “for certain, th’ carriage is coming. So
let us go and dream on it.”

 

CHAPTER IX.

“A life of self-indulgence is for us
A life of self-denial is for
For us the streets, broad-built and populous,
For them unhealthy corners, garrets dim,

Tue next evening it was a warm’, pattering, incessant
rain, just the rain to waken up the flowers. But in Man-

+ “Reet,” right; often used for “very.”

 

    

  
  

 

107

chester, where, alas! there are no flowers, the rain had only
a disheartening and gloomy effect; the streets were wet and
dirty, the drippings from the houses were wet and dirty, and
the people were wet and dirty. Indeed, most kept within-
doors; and there was an unusual silence of footsteps in the
little paved courts.

Mary had to change her Glothes after her walk home; and
had hardly settled herself before she heard some one fumbling
at the door. The noise continued long enough to allow her
to get up, and go and open it. There stood — could it be?
yes it was, her father!

Drenched and way-worn, there he stood! He came in
with no word to Mary in return for her cheery and astonished
greeting. He sat down by the fire in his wet things, unheeding.
But Mary would not Jet him so rest. She ran up and brought
down his working-day clothes, and went into the pantry to
rummage up their little bit of provision while he changed by
the fire, talking all the while as gaily as she could, though
her father’s depression hung like lead on her heart.

For Mary, in her seclusion at Miss Simmonds’, — where
the chief talk was of fashions, and dress, and parties to be
given, for which such and such gowns would be wanted,
varied with a slight whispered interlude occasionally about
love and lovers, —had not heard the political news of the
day: that parliament had refused to listen to the working-
men, when they petitioned with all the force of their rough,
untutored words to be heard concerning the distress which
was riding, like the Conqueror on his Pale Horse, among
the people; which was crushing their lives out of them, and
stamping woemarks over the land.

When he had eaten and was refreshed, they sat in silence
for some time; for Mary wished him to tell her what oppressed
him so, yet durst not ask. In this she was wise; for when
we are heavy laden in our hearts it falls, in better with our
humour to reveal our case in our own way, and our own
time.

Mary sat on a stool at her father’s feet in old childish

 

108

 

guise, and stole her hand into his, while his sadness infected
her, and.she “caught the trick of grief, and sighed,” she
knew not why.

“Mary, we mun speak to our God to hear us, for man will
not hearken; no, not now, when we weep tears o’ blood.””

In an instant Mary understood the fact, if not the details,
that so weighed down her father’s heart. She pressed his
hand with silent sympathy. She did not know what to say,
and was so afraid of speaking wrongly, that she was silent.
But when his attitude had remained unchanged for more than
half-an-hour, his eyes gazing vacantly and fixedly at the fire,
no sound but now and then a deep drawn sigh to break the
weary ticking of the clock, and the drip-drop from the roof
without, Mary could bear it no longer. Any thing to rouse
her father. Even bad news.

“Father, do you know George Wilson ’s dead?” (Her
hand was suddenly and almost violently compressed.) “He
dropped down dead in Oxford Road yester morning. It’s
very sad, isn’t it, father?”

Her tears were ready to flow as she looked up in her
father’s face for sympathy. Still the same fixed look of
despair, not varied by grief for the dead.

“Best for him to die,” he said, in a low voice.

‘This was unbearable. Mary got up under pretence of
going to tell Margaret that she need not come to sleep with
her to-night, but really to ask Job Legh to come and cheer
her father.

She stopped outside the door. Margaret was practising
her singing, and through the still night air her voice rang out
like that of an angel.

“Comfort ye, comfort ye, my people, saith your God.”

The old Hebrew prophetic words fell like dew on Mary’s
heart. She could not interrupt. She stood listening and
“comforted,” till the little buzz of conversation again began,
and then entered and told her errand.

Both grandfather and grand-daughter rose instantly to
fulfil her request.

looked grave enough, yo may be sure; and such a set of thin,
wan, wretched-looking chaps as they were!””

“Yourself is none to boast on.”

“Ay, but I were fat and rosy to many a one. Well, we
walked on and on through many a street, much the same as
Deansgate. We had'to walk slowly, slowly, for th’ carriages
an’ cabs as thronged th’ streets. I thought by-and-bye we
should may be get clear on’em, but as the streets grew wider
they grew worse, and at last we were fairly blocked up at
Oxford Street. We getten across at after awhile though, and
my eyes! the grand streets we were inthen! They 're sadly
puzzled how to build houses though in London; there ’d be
an opening for a good steady master builder there, as know'd
his business. For yo see the houses are many on ’em built
without any proper shape for a body to live in; some on ’em
they ’ve after thought would fall down, so they ’ve stuck great
ugly pillars out before’em. And some on *em (we thought
they must be th’ tailor’s sign) had getten stone men and
women as wanted clothes stuck on ’em. I were like a child,
I forgot a’ my errant in looking about me. By this it were
dinner-time, or better, as we could tell by the sun, right
above our heads, and we were dusty and tired, going a step
now and a step then. Well, at last we getten into a street
grander nor all, leading to th’ Queen’s palace, and there it
were I thought I saw th’ Queen. Yo 've seen th’ hearses wi’
white plumes, Job?”

Job assented.

“Well, them undertaker folk are driving a protty trade in
London. Wellnigh every lady we saw in a carriage had hired
one o’ them plumes for the day, and had it niddle noddling on
her head. It were th’ Queen's drawing-room, they said, and
th’ carriages went bowling along toward her house, some wi?
dressed-up gentlemen like circus folk in’em, and rucks* 0”

So, daunted in their inquiries, they sat silent for a few
minutes.

Old Job, however, felt that some one must speak, else all
the good they had done in dispelling John Barton’s gloom was
lost. So after awhile he thought of a subject, neither suf-
ficiently dissonant from the last to jar on the full heart, nor too
much the same to cherish the continuance of the gloomy train
of thought.

“Did you ever hear tell,” said he to Mary, “that I were in
London once?”

“No!” said she, with surprise, and looking at Job with
increased respect.

“Ay, but I were though, and Peg there too, though she
minds nought about it, poor wench! You must know I had
but one child, and she were Margaret’s mother. I loved her
above a bit, and one day when she came (standing behind me
for that I should not see her blushes, and stroking my cheeks
in her own coaxing way), and told me she and Frank Jennings
(as was a joiner lodging near us) should be so happy if they
were married, I could not find it in my heart t’ say her nay,
though I went sick at the thought of losing her away from
myhome. However, she was my only child, and I never said
nought of what I felt, for fear o’ grieving her young heart.
But I tried to think 0’ the time when I’d been young mysel,
and had loved her blessed mother, and how we ’d left father
and mother, and gone out into th’ world together, and I’m
now right thankful I held my peace, and didna fret her wi’
telling her how sore I was at parting wi’ her that were the light
o’ my eyes.”

“But,” said Mary, “you said the young man were a neigh-
bour.””

“Ay, so he were, and his father afore him. But work were
rather slack in Manchester, and Frank’s uncle sent him word
o’ London work and London wages, so he were to go there;
and it were there Margaret was to follow him. Well, my heart
aches yet at thought of those days. She so happy, and he so
happy; only the poor father as fretted sadly behind their

dinished our breakfast, and Jennings were looking hard at th’
woman as she were getting the babby to sleep wi’ a sort of
rocking way. At length says he, ‘Iha’ learnt th’ way now;
it’s two jiggits and a shake, two jiggits and shake. Ican
get that babby asleep now mysel.’

“The man had nodded cross enough to us, and had gone
to th’ door, and stood there whistling wi’ his hands in his
breeches-pockets, looking abroad. But at last he turns and
says, quite sharp,

“«T say, Missis, I’m to have no breakfast to-day, I
*spose.”

“So wi’ that she kissed th’ child, a long, soft kiss; and
looking in my face to see if I could take her meaning, gave me
th’ babby without a word. I were loath to stir, but I saw it
were beiter to go. So giving Jennings a sharp nudge (for
he'd fallen asleep), I says, ‘Missis, what’s to pay?’ pulling
out my money wi’ a jingle that she might na guess we were at
all bare 0’ cash. So she looks at her husband, who said ne’er
a word, but were listening wi’ all his ears nevertheless; and
when she saw he would na say, she said, hesitating, as if
pulled two ways, by her fear o’ him, ‘Should you think six-
pence over much?’ It were so different to public-house
reckoning, for we’d eaten a main deal afore the chap came
down. So says I, ‘And, Missis, what should we gie you for
the babby ’s bread and milk?’ (I had it once in my mind to
say ‘and for a’ your trouble with it,’ but my heart would na
let me say it, for I could read in her ways how it had beena
work 0’ love). So says she, quite quick, and stealing a look
at her husband’s back, as looked all ear, if ever a back did,
‘Oh, we could take nought for the little babby’s food, if it
had eaten twice as much, bless it.’ Wi’ that he looked at
her; such a scowling look! She knew what he meant, and
stepped softly across the floor to him, and put her hand on
his arm. He seem’d as though he ’d shake it off by a jerk on
his elbow, but she said quite low, ‘For poor little Johnnie’s
sake, Richard.’ He did not move or speak again, and after
looking in his face fora minute, she turned away, swallowing

talking on oud times. It were like enough to send thee to
sleep. Try if thou canst keep thine eyes open while I read
thy father a bit on a poem as is written by a weaver like oursel.
A rare chap I’ll be bound is he who could weave verse like
this.”

So adjusting his spectacles on nose, cocking his chin,
crossing his legs, and coughing to clear his voice, he read
aloud a little poem of Samuel Bamford’s* he had picked up
somewhere.

God belp the poor, who, on this wintry morn,
Come forth from alleys dim and courts obscure.
God help yon poor pale girl, who droops forlorn,
And meekly her affliction doth endure;
God help her, outcast lamb; she trembling stands,
All wan her lips, and frozen red ber hands;
Her sunken eyes are modestly down-cast,
Her night-black hair streams on the fitful blast;
Her bosom, passing fair, is half revealed,
And ob! so cold, the snow lies there congealed;
Her feet benumbed, her shoes all rent and worn,
God help thee, outcast lamb, who standst forlorn!
God help the poor!

God help the poor! An infant's feeble wail
Comes from yon narrow gateway, and behold!

A female crouching there, so deathly pale,
Huddling her child, to screen it from the cold;

Her vesture scant, her bonnet crushed and torn;
‘A thin shaw! doth her baby dear enfold’

And so she ’bides the ruthless gale of morn,
Which almost to her heart hath sent its cold,

And now she, sudden, darts a ravening look,

‘As one, with new hot bread, goes past the nook;

And, a5 the tempting load is onward borne,

She weeps. God help thee, helpless one, forlorn?

God help the poor!

God help the poor! Behold yon famished lad,
No shoes, nor hose, his wounded feet protect;
With limping gait, and looks so dreamy sad,
He wanders on, stooping to inspect
Each window, stored with artitles of food.

Desparr settled down like a heavy cloud; and now and
then, through the dead calm of sufferings, came pipings of
stormy winds, foretelling the end of these dark prognostics.
In times of sorrowful or fierce endurance, we are often
soothed by the mere repetition of old proverbs which tell the
experience of our forefathers; but now, “it’s a long lane
that has no turning,” “the weariest day draws to an end,” &c.,
seemed false and vain sayings, so long and so weary was the
pressure of the terrible times. Deeper and deeper still sank
the poor; it showed how much lingering suffering it takes to
kill men, that so few (in comparison) died during those times.
But remember! we only miss those who do men’s work in
their humble sphere; the aged, the feeble, the children,
when they die, are hardly noted by the world; and yet to
many hearts, their deaths make a blank which long years will
never fillup. Remember, too, that though it may take much
suffering to kill the able-bodied and effective members of
society, it does not take much to reduce them to worn, list-
less, diseased creatures, who thenceforward crawl through
life with moody hearts and pain-stricken bodies.

The people had thought the poverty of the preceding years
hard to bear, and had found its yoke heavy; but this year
added sorely to its weight. Former times had chastised them
with whips, but this chastised them with scorpions.

Of course, Barton had his share of mere bodily sufferings.
Before he had gone up to London on his vain errand, he had
been working short time. But in the hopes of speedy redress
by means of the interference of Parliament, he had thrown
up his place; and now, when he asked leave to resume his
work, he was told they were diminishing their number of

that for the present he must still be content with stolen meet-

and summer evening strolls, and the delight of pouring
sweet honeyed words into her ear, while she listened with a
blush and a smile that made her look radiant with beauty.
No, he would be cautious in order to be certain; for Mary
one way, or another, he must make his. He had no doubt
of the effect of his own personal charms in the long run;
for he knew he was handsome, and believed himself fasci-.
nating.

If he had known what Mary’s home was, he would not
have been so much convinced of his increasing influence over
her, by her being more and more ready to linger with him in
the sweet summer air. For when she returned for the night
her father was often out, and the house wanted the cheerful
look it had had in the days when money was never wanted to
purchase soap and brushes, black-lead and pipe-clay. It was
dingy and comfortless; for, of course, there was not even the
dumb familiar home-friend, afire. And Margaret, too, was
now so often from home, singing at some of those grand
places. And Alice; oh, Mary wished she had never left her
cellar to go and live at Ancoats with her sister-in-law. Forin
that matter Mary felt very guilty; she had put off and put off
going to see the widow after George Wilson’s death from
dread of meeting Jem, or giving him reason to think she
wished to be as intimate with him as formerly; and now she
was so much ashamed of her delay that she was likely never to
go at all.

If her father was at home it was no better; indeed it was
worse. He seldom spoke, less than ever; and often when he
did speak they were sharp angry words, such ashe had never
given her formerly. Her temper was high, too, and her
answers not over-mild; and once in his passion he had even
beaten her. If Sally Leadbitter or Mr. Carsons had been at
hand at that moment, Mary would have been ready to leave
home for ever. She satalone, after her father had flung out
of the house, bitterly thinking on the days that were gone;
‘angry with her own hastiness, and believing that her father

They were all desperate members of Trades’ Unions,
ready for any thing; made ready by want.

While ali this change for gloom yet struck fresh and heavy
on Mary’s heart, her father startled her out of a reverie one
evening, by asking her when she had been to see Jane Wilson.
From his manner of speaking, she was made aware that he
had been; but at the time of his visit he had never mentioned
any thing aboutit. Now, however, he grufily told her to go
next day without fail, and added some abuse of her for not
having been before. The little outward impulse of her
father's speech gave Mary the push, which she, in this in-
stance required; and accordingly, timing her visit so as to
avoid Jem’s hours at home, she went the following afternoon.
to Ancoats.

The outside of the well-known house struck her as dif-
ferent; for the door was closed, instead of open, as it once
had always stood. The window-plants, George Wilson's
pride and especial care, looked withering and drooping.
‘They had been without water fora long time, and now, when
the widow had reproached herself severely for neglect, in her
ignorant anxiety, she gave them too much. On opening the
door, Alice was seen, not stirring about in her habitual way,
but knitting by the fire-side. The room felt hot, although the
fire burnt gray and dim, under the bright rays of the after-
noon sun. Mrs. Wilson was “‘siding”’* the dinner things, and
talking all the time, in a kind of whining, shouting voice,
which Mary did not at first understand. She understood, at
once, however, that her absence had been noted, and talked
over; she saw a constrained look on Mrs. Wilson’s sorrow-
stricken face, which told her a scolding was to come.

“Dear! Mary, is that you?” she began. “Why, who
would ha’ dreamt of seeing you! We thought you’d clean
forgotten us; and Jem has often wondered if he should know
you, if he met you in the street.””

Now, poor Jane Wilson had been sorely tried; and at
present her trials had had no outward effect, but that of in-

* To “side,” to put aside, or in order.

 

132

Yes! Mary had heard, and so she said. But the poor
woman’s thoughts had gone back to those days, and her little
recollections came out, with many interruptions of sighs, and
tears, and shakes of the head.

“There were nought about me for him to choose me.
I were just well enough afore that accident, but at after I were
downright plain. And there was Bessy Witter as would ha”
given her eyes for him; she as is Mrs. Carsons now, for she
were a handsome lass, although I never could see her beauty
then; and Carsons warn’t so much above her, as they ’re both
above us all now.”

Mary went very red, and wished she could help doing so,
and wished also that Mrs. Wilson would tell her more about
the father and mother of her lover; but she durst not ask, and
Mrs. Wilson's thoughts soon returned to her husband, and
their early married days.

“If you'll believe me, Mary, there never was such a born
goose at house-keeping as I were; and yet he married me!
T had been in a factory sin’ five years old a’most, and I knew
nought about cleaning, or cooking, let alone washing and
such-like work. The day after we were married he went to
his work at after breakfast, and says he, ‘Jenny, well ha’ th’
cold beef, and potatoes, and that’s a dinner for a prince.’
I were anxious to make him comfortable, God knows how
anxious. And yet I’d no notion how to cook a potatoe.
Iknow’d they were boiled, and know’d their skins were taken
off, and that were all. So I tidyed my house in a rough kind
o’ way, then I looked at that very clock up yonder,” pointing
at one that hung against the wall, ‘(and I seed it were nine
o'clock, so, thinks I, th’ potatoes shall be well boiled at any
rate, and I gets ’em on th’ fire in a jiffy (that’s to say, as soon
as I could peel ’em, which were a tough job at first), and then
I fell to unpacking my boxes! and at twenty minutes past
twelve he comes home, and I had the beef ready on th’ table,
and I went to take the potatoes out 0’ th’ pot; but oh! Mary,
th’ water had boiled away, and they were all a nasty brown

88, as smelt through all the house. He said nought, and

 

 

134

“Pooh! don't tell me it’s not the Queen as makes laws;
and isn’t she bound to obey Prince Albert? And if he said
they mustn't, why she ’d say they mustn’t, and then all folk
would say, oh no, we never shall do any such thing no
more.”

«Jem ’s getten on rarely,” said Alice, who had not heard
her sister’s last bursts of eloquence, and whose thoughts
were still running on her nephew, and his various talents.
“He’s found out summut about a crank or tank, I forget
rightly which it is, but th’ master ’s made him foreman, and
he all the while turning off hands; but he said he could na’
part wi’ Jem, nohow. He’s good wage now: I tell him he ‘lL
be thinking of marrying soon, and he deserves aright down
good wife, that he does.”

Mary went very red, and looked annoyed, although there
was a secret spring of joy deep down in her heart, at hearing
Jem so spoken of. But his mother only saw the annoyed
look, and was piqued accordingly. She was not over and
above desirous that her son should marry. His presence in
the house seemed arelic of happier times, and she had some
little jealousy of his future wife, whoever she might be. Still
she could not bear any one not to feel gratified and flattered
by Jem’s preference, and full well she knew how above all
others he preferred Mary. Now she had never thought Mary
good enough for Jem, and her late neglect in coming to see
her, still.rankled a little in her breast. So she determined
to invent a little, in order to do away with any idea Mary
might have that Jem would choose her for “his right down
good wife,” as aunt Alice called it.

“Ay, he'll be for taking a wife soon,” and then, in a
lower voice, as if confidentially, but really to prevent any
contradiction or explanation from her simple sister-in-law,
she added,

“It'll not be long afore Molly Gibson (that’s her at th’
provision-shop round the corner) will hear a secret as will not
displease her I’m thinking. She ’s been casting sheep’s eyes
at our Jem this many a day, but he thought her father would

and street, she slackened her pace, and began to think. Did
Jem really care for Molly Gibson? Well, if he did, let him.
People seemed all to think he was much too good for her
(Mary’s own self). Perhaps some one else, far more hand-
some, and far more grand, would show him one day that she
was good enough to be Mrs. Henry Carsons. So temper, or
what Mary called “spirit,” led her to encourage Mr. Carsons
more than ever she had done before.

Some weeks after this there was a meeting of the Trades’
Union to which John Barton belonged. The morning of the
day on which it was to take place he had lain late in bed, for
what was the use of getting up? He had hesitated between
the purchase of meal or opium, and had chosen the latter, for
its‘use had become a necessity with him. He wanted it to
relieve him from the terrible depression its absence occa-
sioned. A large lump seemed only to bring him into @ natural
state, or what had been his natural state formerly. Eight
o’clock was the hour fixed for the meeting; and at it were
read letters, filled with details of woe, from all parts of the
country. Fierce, heavy gloom brooded over the assembly;
and fiercely and heavily did the men separate, towards eleven
o’clock, some irritated by the opposition of others to their
desperate plans.

It was not a night to cheer them, as they quitted the glare
of the gas-lighted room, and came out into the street. Un-
ceasing, soaking rain was falling; the very lamps seemed
obscured by the damp upon the glass, and their light reached
but to a little distance from the posts. The streets were
cleared of passers-by; not creature seemed stirring, ‘except
here and there a drenched policeman in his oil-skin cape.
Barton wished the others good-night, and set offhome. He
had gone through a street or two, when he heard a step behind
him; but he did not care to stop and see who it was. A little
farther, and the person quickened step, and touched his arm
very lightly. He turned, and saw, even by the darkness
visible of that badly-lighted street, that the woman who stood
by him was of no doubtful profession. It was told by her

 

138

In vain did her face grow deadly pale around the vivid circle
of paint, in vain did she gasp for mercy,—he burst forth again.
“(And thou names that name to me! and thou thinks the
thought of her will bring thee mercy! Dost thou know it was
thee who killed her, as sure as ever Cain killed Abel. She’d
loved thee as her own, and she trusted thee as her own, and
when thou wert gone she never held head up again, but died
in less than athree week; and ather judgment day she'll rise,
and point to thee as her murderer; or if she don’t, I will.”

He flung her, trembling, sinking, fainting, from him, and
strode away. She fell with a feeble scream against the lamp-
post, and lay there in her weakness, unable to rise. A po-
liceman came up in time to see the close of these occurrences,
and concluding from Esther’s unsteady, reeling fall, that she
was tipsy, he took her in her half-unconscious state to the
lock-ups for the night. The superintendent of that abode of
vice and misery, was roused from his dozing watch through
the dark hours, by half-delirious wails and moanings, which he
reported as arising from intoxication. If he had listened he
‘would have heard these words, repeated in various forms, but
always in the same anxious, muttering way.

“He would not listen to me; what canI do? He would
not listen to me, and I wanted to warn him! Oh, what shall I
do to save Mary’s child! What shallI do? How canI keep
her from being such a one asI am; such a wretched, loath-
some creature! She was listening just as I listened, and
loving just as I loved, and the end will be just like my end.
How shallIsave her? She won't hearken to warning, or heed
it more thanI did; and who loves her well enough to watch
over her as she should be watched? God keep her from
harm! And yetI won't pray forher; sinner thatIam! Can
my prayers be heard? No! they'll only do harm. How
shall I save her? He would not listen to me.””

So the night wore away. ‘The next morning she was taken
up to the New Bailey. It was a clear case of disorderly
vagrancy, and she was committed to prison fora month. How
much might happen in that time!

every fantastic, discreditable bonnet, in the hopes of once
more meeting Esther, and addressing her in a far different
manner from what he had done before. But he returned,
night after night, disappointed in his search, and at last gave
it up in despair, and tried to recall his angry feelings towards
her, in order to find relief from his present self-reproach.

He often looked at Mary, and wished she were not so like
her aunt, for the very bodily likeness seemed to suggest the
possibility of a similar likeness in their fate; and then this
idea enraged his irritable mind, and he became suspicious
and anxious about Mary’s conduct. Now hitherto she had
been so remarkably free from all control, and almost from
all inquiry concerning her actions, that she did not brook
this change in her father’s behaviour very well. Just when
she was yielding more than ever to Mr. Carsons’ desire of fre-
quent meetings, it was hard to be so questioned concerning
her hours of leaving off work, whether she had come straight
home, &c. She could not tell lies; though she could conceal
much if she were not questioned. So she took refuge in ob-
stinate silence, alleging as a reason for it her indignation at
being so cross-examined. This did not add to the good
feeling between father and daughter, and yet they dearly
loved each other; and in the minds of each, one principal
reason for maintaining such behaviour as displeased the
other, was the believing that this conduct would insure that
person’s happiness.

Her father now began to wish Mary were married. Then
this terrible superstitious fear suggested by her likeness to
Esther would be done away with. He felt that he could not
resume the reins he had once slackened. But with a husband
it would be different. If Jem Wilson would but marry her!
With his character for steadiness and talent! But he was
afraid Mary had slighted him, he came so seldom now to the
house. He would ask her.

“Mary, what’s come o’er thee and Jem Wilson? Yo were
great friends at one time.”

“Oh, folk say he’s going to be married to Molly Gibson,

 

142

 

He believed he only delayed before his little looking-glass for
cowardice, for absolute fear of a girl. He would try not to
think so much about the affair, and he thought the more.

Poor Jem! it is not an auspicious moment for thee!

“Come in,” said Mary, as some one knocked at the door,
while she sat sadly at her sewing, trying to earn a few pence
by working over hours at some mourning.

Jem entered, looking more awkward and abashed than
he had ever done before. Yet here was Mary all alone, just
as he had hoped to find her. She did not ask him to take a
chair, but after standing a minute or two he sat down near
her.

“Ts your father at home, Mary?” said he, by way of
making an opening, for she seemed determined to keep
silence, and went on stitching away.

“No, he’s gone to his Union, I suppose.” Another
silence. It was no use waiting, thought Jem. The subject
would never be led to by any talk he could think of in his
anxious fluttered state. He had better begin at once.

“Mary!” said he, and the unusual tone of his voice made
her look up for an instant, but in that time she understood
from his countenance what was coming, and her heart beat
so suddenly and violently she could hardly sit stil. Yet one
thing she was sure of; nothing he could say should make her
have him. She would show them all who would be glad to
have her. She was not yet calm after her father’s irritating
speeches. Yet her eyes fell veiled before that passionate
look fixed upon her.

“Dear Mary! (for how dear you are, I cannot rightly
tell you in words). It’s no new story I'm going to speak
about. You must ha’ seen and known it long; for since we
were boy and girl, I ha’ loved you above father and mother
and all; and all I've thought on by day and dreamt on by
night, has been something in which you've hadashare. I’d
no way of keeping you for long, and I scorned to try and tie
you down; and I lived in terror lest some one else should
take you to himself. But now, Mary, I’m foreman in th’

 

144

“And is this the end of all my hopes and fears? the end
of my life, I may say, for it is the end of all worth living
for!” His agitation rose and carried him into passion.
“Mary! you ’IThear, may be, of me asa drunkard, and may
be asa thief, and may be as amurderer. Remember! when
all are speaking ill of me, you will have no right to blame me,
for it ’s your cruelty that will have made me what I feel I shall
become. You won't even say you'll try and like me; will
you, Mary!” said he, suddenly changing his tone from
threatening despair to fond passionate entreaty, as he took
her hand and held it forcibly between both of his, while he
tried to catch a glimpse of her averted face. She was silent,
but it was from deep and violent emotion. He could not bear
to wait; he would not hope, to be dashed away again; he
rather in his bitterness of heart chose the certainty of despair,
and before she could resolve what to answer, he flung away
her hand and rushed out of the house.

“Jem! Jem!” cried she, with faint and choking voice.
It was too late; he left strect after street behind him with his
almost winged speed, as he sought the fields, where he might
give way unobserved to all the deep despair he felt.

It was scarcely ten minutes since he had entered the house,
and found Mary at comparative peace, and now she lay half
across the dresser, her head hidden in her hands, and every
part of her body shaking with the violence of her sobs. She
could not have told at first (if you had asked her, and she
could have commanded voice enough to answer) why she was
in such agonised grief. It was too sudden for her to analyse,
or think upon it. She only felt, that by her own doing her
life would be hereafter blank and dreary. By-and-bye her
sorrow exhausted her body by its power, and she seemed to
have no strength left for crying, She sat down; and now
thoughts crowded on her mind. One little hour ago, and all
‘was still unsaid, and she had her fate in her own power. And
yet, how long ago had she determined to say pretty much
at she did, if the occasion ever offered.

his love, was another anxious question. She wearied herself
with proposing plans, and rejecting them.

She was roused to a consciousness of time, by hearing the
neighbouring church clock strike twelve. Her father she
knew might be expected home any minute, and she was in
no mood for a meeting with him. So she hastily gathered up
her work, and went to her own little bed-room, leaving him
to let himself in.

She put out her candle, that her father might not see its
light under the door; and sat down on her bed to think. But
again turning things over in her mind again and again, she
could only determine at once to put an end to all further com-
munication with Mr. Carsons, in the most decided way she
could. Maidenly modesty (and true love is ever modest)
seemed to oppose every plan she could think of, for showing
Jem how much she repented her decision against him, and
how dearly she had now discovered that she loved him. She
came to the unusual wisdom of resolving to do nothing, but
strive to be patient, and improve circumstances as they might
turnup. Surely, if Jem knew of her remaining unmarried, he
vould try his fortune again. He would never be content with
one rejection; she believed she could not in his place. She
had been very wrong, but now she would endeavour to do
right, and have womanly patience, until he saw her changed
and repentant mind in her natural actions. Even if she had
to wait for years, it was no more than now it was easy to look
forward to,as a penance for her giddy flirting on the one hand,
and her cruel mistake concerning her feelings on the other.
So anticipating a happy ending to the course of her love, how-
ever distant it might be, she fell asleep just as the earliest
factory bells were ringing. She had sunk down in her clothes,
and her sleep was unrefreshing. She wakened up shivery and
chill in body, and sorrow-stricken in mind, though she could
not at first rightly tell the cause of her depression.

She recalled the events of the night before, and still
resolved to adhere to those determinations she had then

 

148

on her road, and she arrived at home, which she found as she
expected, empty; for she knew it was a club night, which her
father would not miss. She sat down to recover breath, and
to still her heart, which panted more from nervousness than
from over-exertion, although she had walked so quickly.
‘Then she arose, and taking off her bonnet, her eye caught
the form of Sally Leadbitter passing the window with a linger-
ing step, and looking into the darkness with all her might as,
if to ascertain if Mary were returned. In an instant she re-
passed and knocked at the house-door, but without awaiting
an answer, she entered.

“Well, Mary, dear,” (knowing well how little “dear”
Mary considered her just then); “it's so difficult to get any
comfortable talk at Miss Simmonds’, I thought I’d just step
up and see you at home.”

“IT understood from what you said your mother was ailing,
and that you wanted to be withher,” replied Mary, in no
welcoming tone.

“Ay, but mother’s better now,” said the unabashed Sally.
“Your father’s out, I suppose?” looking round as well as she
could; for Mary made no haste to perform the hospitable of-
fices of striking a match, and lighting a candle.

“Yes, he ’s out,” said Mary, shortly, and busying her-
self at last about the candle, without ever asking her visitor to
sit down.

“So much the better,” answered Sally, “ for to tell you
the truth, Mary, I ’ve a friend at th’ end of the road, as
is anxious to come and see you at home, since you ’re grown
so particular as not to like to speak to him in the street. He "Il
be here directly.”

“Oh, Sally, don’t let him,” said Mary, speaking at last
heartily; and running to the door she would have fastened
it, but Sally held her hands, laughing meanwhile at her
distress.

“Ob, please, Sally,” struggling, “dear Sally! don’t let
him come here, the neighbours will so talk, and father ll go
mad if he hears; hell kill me, Sally, he will. Besides, I

 

150

Not very far from the end of the street, into which the
court where Mary lived opened, they met Mr. Carsons, his hat
& good deal slouched over his face-as if afraid of being re-
cognised. He turned when he saw them coming, and led the
way without uttering a word (although they were close behind)
to a street of half-finished houses.

‘The length of the walk gave Mary time to recoil from the
interview which was to follow; but even if her own resolve
to go through with it had failed, there was the steady grasp
of Sally Leadbitter, which she could not evade, without an
absolute struggle.

At last he stopped in the shelter and concealment of a
wooden fence, put up to keep the building rubbish from ii
truding on the foot-pavement. Inside this fence, a minute
afterwards, the girls were standing by him; Mary now return-
ing Sally’s detaining grasp with interest, forshe had determined
on the way to make her a witness, willing, or unwilling, to the
ensuing conversation. But Sally’s curiosity led her to be a
very passive prisoner in Mary’s hold.

‘With more freedom than he had ever used before, Mr. Car-
sons put his arm firmly round Mary’s waist, in spite of her in-
dignant resistance.

“Nay, nay! you little witch! Now I have caught you, I
shall keep you prisoner. Tell me now what has made you
run away from me so fast these few days — tell me, you sweet
little coquette!”

Mary ceased struggling, but turned so as to be almost
opposite to him, while she spoke out calmly, and boldly.

“Mr. Carsons! I want to speak to you. for onee and for
all. Since I met you last Monday evening, I have made up
my mind to have nothing more to do with you. I know
I've been wrong in leading you to think Iliked you; but
I believe I didn’t rightly know my own mind; and I humbly
beg your pardon, Sir, if I’ve led you to think too much
of me.”

For an instant he was surprised; the next, vanity came to
his aid, and convinced him that she could only be joking. He,

 

 

152

This naive and candid avowal served her but little. He
could not understand how it could be true. Some reason lurked.
behind. He was passionately in love. What should he do to
tempt her? A thought struck him.

“Listen! Mary. Nay, I cannot let you go till you have
heard me. I do love you dearly; and I won’t believe but
what you love me avery little, justavery little. Well, ifyou
don’t like to own it, never mind! I only want now to tell you
how much I love you, by what I am ready to give up for you.
You know (or perhaps you are not fully aware) how little my
father and mother would like me to marry you. So angry
would they be, and so much widicule should I have to brave,
that of course I have never thought of it tillnow. Ithought
we could be happy enough without marriage.” (Deep sank
those words into Mary’sheart.) “Butnow, if youlike, Ill
get a licence to-morrow morning — nay, to-night, and 1'll
marry you in defiance of all the world, rather than give you up.
Ina year or two my father will forgive me, and meanwhile you
shall have every luxury money can purchase, and every charm
that love can devise to make your life happy. Afterall, my
mother was but a factory girl.” (This was said to himself, as
if to reconcile himself to this bold step.) “Now, Mary, you
see how willing I am to— to sacrifice a good deal for you; I
even offer you marriage, to satisfy your little ambitious heart;
80, now, won’t you say, you can love me alittle, little bit?”

He pulled her towards him. To his surprise, she still
resisted. Yes! though all she had pictured to herself for so
many months in being the wife of Mr. Carsons, was now within
her grasp, she resisted. His speech had given her but one
feeling, that of exceeding great relief. For she had dreaded,
now she knew what true love was, to think of the attachment
she might have created; the deep feeling her flirting conduct
might have called out. She had loaded herself with re-
proaches for the misery she might have caused. It was &
relief, to gather that the attachment was of that low, despi-
cable kind, which can plan to seduce the object of its affection;
that the feeling shé had caused was shallow enough, for it only

 

154

 

if I liked, and yet I was willing and ready to marry a poor
dress-maker. Don’t you understand me now? and don’t you
see what a sacrifice I was making to humour her? and all to no
avail.”

Sally was silent, so he went on:

“My father would have forgiven any temporary con-
nexion, far sooner than my marrying one so far beneath me in

“I thought you said, Sir, your mother was a factory girl,”
reminded Sally , rather maliciously.

“Yes, yes! —but then my father was in much such a
station; at any rate, there was not the disparity there is be-
tween Mary and me.”

‘Another pause.

“Then you mean to give her up, Sir. She made no bones
of saying she gave you up.”

«No, I do not mean to give her up, whatever you and she
may please to think. I am more in love with her than ever;
even for this charming capricious ebullition of hers. She “Il
come round, you may depend upon it. Women always do.
‘They always have second thoughts, and find out that they are
best in casting off a lover. Mind I don’t say I shall offer her
the same terms again.”

With a few more words of no importance, the allies

parted.
CHAPTER XII.

“Tlov'd him not; and yet, now he is gone,
I feel I am alone.
I check’d him while he spoke; yet could he speak,
Alas! I would not check.
For reasons not to love him once I sought,
And wearied all my thought.” W. S. Lanpor.
Anp now Mary had, as she thought, dismissed both her
lovers. But they looked on their dismissals with very dif-
ferent eyes. He who loved her with all his heart and with all
his soul, considered his rejection final. He did not comfort
himself with the idea, which would have proved so well

 

156

some excuse, just to see if she hadn’t changed her mind. He
never came. ‘Then she grew weary and impatient, and her
spirits sank. The persecution of the one lover, and the
neglect of the other, oppressed her sorely. She could not
now sit quietly through the evening at her work; or, ifshe
kept, by a strong effort, from pacing up and down the room,
she felt as if she must sing to keep off thought while she sewed.
And her songs were the maddest, merriest, she could think of.
“Barbara Allen,” and such sorrowful ditties, did well enough
for happy times; but now she required all the aid that could
be derived from external excitement to keep down the im-
pulse of grief.

And her father, too — he was a great anxiety to her, he
looked so changed and so ill. Yet he would not acknowledge
to any ailment. She knew, that be it as late as it would, she
never left off work until (if the poor servants paid her pretty
regularly for the odd jobs of mending she did for them) she
had earned a few pence, enough for one good meal for her
father on the next day. But very frequently, all she could
do in the morning, ufter her late sitting up at night, was to
run with the work home, and receive the money from the
person for whom it was done. She could not stay often to
make purchases of food, but gave up the money at once to
her father’s eager clutch; sometimes prompted by a savage
hunger it is true, but more frequently by a craving for
opium.

On the whole he was not so hungry as his daughter. For
it was a long fast from the one o’clock dinner-hour at Miss
Simmonds’ to the close of Mary’s vigil, which was often ex-
tended to midnight, She was young, and had not yet learned
to bear “clemming.”

One evening, as she sang a merry song over her work,
stopping occasionally to sigh, the blind Margaret came
groping in. It had been one of Mary's additional sorrows
that her friend had been absent from home, accompanying
the lecturer on music in his round among the manufacturing
towns of Yorkshire and Lancashire. Her grandfather, too,

 

158

meetings, and he telled me all about his invention for doing
away wi’ the crank, or somewhat. His master bought it from
him, and ta’en outa patent, and Jem’s a gentleman for life
wi’ the money his master gied him. But you ’ll ha’ heard all
this, Mary.”

No! she had not.

“Well, I thought it all happened afore he left Manchester,
and then in course you’d ha’ known. But may be it were all
settled after he got to Halifax; however, he’s gotten two or’
three hunder pounds for his invention. But what ’s up with
you Mary? you're sadly out o’ sorts You’ve never been
quarrelling wi’ Jem, surely.”

Now Mary cried outright; she was weak in body, and
unhappy in mind, and the time was come when she might
have the relief of telling her grief. She could not bring her-
self to confess how much of her sorrow was caused by her
having been vain and foolish; she hoped that need never be
known, and she could not bear to think of it.

“Oh, Margaret; do you know Jem came here one night
when I were put out, and cross. Oh, dear! dear! I could
bite my tongue out when I think on it. And he told me how
he loved me, andI thought I did not love him, and I told him
Ididn’t; and, Margaret, —he believed me, and went away
so sad, and so angry; and now I’d do any thing, —I would
indeed,” her sobs choked the end of her sentence. Margaret
looked at her with sorrow, but with hope; for she had no
doubt in her own mind, that it was only a temporary estrange-
ment.

“Tellme, Margaret,” said Mary, taking her apron down
from her eyes, and looking at Margaret with eager anxiety,
“What can I do to bring him back to me? Should I write to
him?” :

“No,” replied her friend, “that would not do. Men
are so queer, they like to have a’ the courting to them-
selves.”

“But I did not mean to write him a courting letter,” said
Mary, somewhat indignantly.

 

160

back in good times.”” The tears stood in Margaret’s eyes as
she spoke.

“Dear Margaret, we're not so bad pressed as that.” (The
thought of her father, and his ill looks, and his one meal a
day, rushed upon Mary.) “And yet, dear, if it would not
put you out o’ your way, — I would work hard to make it up
to you; — but would not your grandfather be vexed?”

“Not he, wench! It were more his thought than mine,
and we have gotten ever so many more at home, so don’t
hurry yourself about paying. It’s hard to be blind, to be sure,
else money comes in so easily now to’ what it used to do; and
it’s downright pleasure to earn it, for I do so like singing.”

“I wish I could sing,” said Mary, looking at the sovereign.

“Some has one kind of gifts, and some another. Many’s
the time when I could see, that I longed for your beauty,
Mary! We're like childer, ever wanting what we han not
got. But now I must say just one more word. Remember,
if you're sore pressed for money, we shall take it very unkind
if you donnot let us know. Good bye to ye.”

In spite of her blindness she hurried away, anxious to
rejoin her grandfather, and desirous also to escape from
Mary’s expressions of gratitude.

Her visit had done Mary good in many ways. It had
strengthened her patience and her hope. It had given her
confidence in Margaret's sympathy; and last, and really least
in comforting power (of so little value are silver and gold in
comparison to love, that gift in every one's power to bestow),
came the consciousness of the money-value of the sovereign
she held in her hand. The many things it might purchase!
First of all came the thought of a comfortable supper for her -
father that very night; and acting instantly upon the idea, she
set off in hopes that all the provision-shops might not yet
be closed, although it was so late.

That night the cottage shone with unusual light, and fire-
gleam; and the father and daughter sat down to a meal they
thought almost extravagant. It was so long since they had

ad enough to eat.

dashing, bronzed-looking, ringletted ssilor, frank, and hearty,
and affectionate.

But it was something different from common to see Alice’s
joy at once more having her foster-child with her. She did
not speak, for she really could not; but the tears came cour-
sing down her old withered cheeks, and dimmed the horn
spectacles she had put on, in order to pry lovingly into his
face. So what with her failing sight, and her tear-blinded
eyes, she gave up the attempt of learning his face by heart
through the medium of that sense, and tried another. She
passed hér sodden, shrivelled hands, all trembling with eager-
ness, over his manly face, bent meekly down in order that she
might more easily make her strange inspection. At last, her
soul was satisfied.

After tea, Mary, feeling sure there was much to be said on
both sides, at which it would be better none should be present,
not even an intimate friend like herself, got up to go away.
This seemed to arouse Alice from her ‘dreamy consciousness
of exceeding happiness, and she hastily followed Mary to the
door. There, standing outside, with the latch in her hand,
she took hold of Mary’s arm, and spoke nearly the first words
she had uttered since her nephew’s return.

“My dear! I shall never forgive mysel, if my wicked
words to-night are any stumbling-block in your path. See
how the Lord has put coals of fire on my head! Ob! Mary,
don’t let my being an unbelieving Thomas weaken your
faith. Wait patiently on the Lord, whatever your trouble

may be.”

Job took his pipe off the chimney-piece and began to
smoke with very audible puffs, as if the story were not worth
listening to.

“Oh! Jack used to say she was for all the world as beau-
tiful as any of the wax ladies in the barbers’ shops; only,
Mary, there were one little difference: her hair was bright
grass green.”

“Ishould not think that was pretty,” said Mary, hesi-
tatingly; as if not liking to doubt the perfection of any thing
belonging to such an acknowledged beauty.

“Oh! but it is when you ’re used to it. I always think
when first we get sight of land, there ’s no colour so lovely as.
grass green. However, she had green hair sure enough;
and were proud enough of it, too; for she were combing it
out full-length when first they sawher. They‘all thought she
were a fair prize, and may be as good asa whale in ready
money (they were whale-fishers you know). For some folk
think a deal of mermaids, whatever other folk do.” This
was a hit at Job, who retaliated in a series of sonorous spit-
tings and puffs.

“So, as I were saying, they pulled towards her, thinking
to catch her. She were all the while combing her beautiful
hair, and beckoning ‘to them, while with the other hand she
held a looking-glass.”

“How many hands had she?”’ asked Job.

“Two, to be sure, just like any other woman,” answered
Will, indignantly.

“Oh! I thought you said she beckoned with one hand, and
combed her hair with another, and held a looking-glass with a
third,” said Job, with provoking quietness.

“No! Ididn’t! at leastif I did, I meant she did one thing
after another, as any one but” (here he mumbled a word or
two) “could understand. Well, Mary,” turning very de-
cidedly towards her; “when she saw them coming near,
whether it were she grew frightened at their fowling-pieces, as
they had on board for a bit 0’ shooting on the island, or
whether it were she were just a fickle jade as did not rightly

“Mary, however, was too much interested by the won-
ders of the deep to perceive the incredulity with which Job
Legh received Wilson’s account of the mermaid, and when
he left off, half offended, and very much inclined not to
open his lips again through the evening, she eagerly said,

“Oh, do tell us something more of what you hear and see
on board ship. Do, Will!”

“What's the use, Mary, if folk won't believe one. There
are things I saw with my own eyes, that some people would
pish and pshaw at, as if I were a baby to be put down by cross
noises. But.I'll tell you, Mary,” with an emphasis on you,
“gome more of the wonders of the sea, sin’ you're not too
wise to believe me. Ihave seen a fish fly.”

This did stagger Mary. She had heard of mermaids as
signs of inns and as sea-wonders, but never of flying fish. Not
soJob. He put down his pipe, and nodding his head as a
token of approbation, he said,

“ Ay, ay! young man. Now you 're speaking truth.”

“Well now! you'll swallow that, old gentleman. You ‘ll
credit me when I say I’ve seen a critter half fish, half bird,
and you won't credit me when I say there be such beasts as
mermaids, half fish, half woman. To me, one’s just as
strange as t’other.””

“You never saw the mermaid yoursel,” interposed Mar-
garet, gently. But “love me, love my dog,” was Will Wil-
son's motto, only his version was “believe me, believe Jack
Harris;” and the remark was not so soothing to him, as it was
intended to have been.

“It’s the Exocetus; one of the Malacopterygii Abdomi-
nales,” said Job, much interested.

“Ay, there you go! You're one o’ them folks as never
knews beasts unless they ’re called out 0’ their names. Put
*em in Sunday clothes and you know ’em, but in their work-
a-day English you never know nought about ’em. I’ve met
wi’ many o’ your kidney; and if I’d ha known it, I’d ha
christened poor Jack’s mermaid wi’ some grand gibberish of
aname. Mermaidicus Jack Harrisensis; that’s just like their

Mary was amused to see how the young sailor sat en-
tranced; mouth, eyes, all open, in order to catch every breath
of sound. His very lids refused to wink, as if afraid in that
brief proverbial interval to lose a particle of the rich music
that floated through the room. For the first time the idea
crossed Mary's mind that it was possible the plain little sen-
sible Margaret, so prim and demure, might have power over
the heart of the handsome, dashing, spirited Will Wilson.

Job, too, was rapidly changing his opinion of his new guest.
‘The flying fish went a great way, and his undisguised admi-
ration for Margaret’s singing carried him still farther.

It was amusing enough to see these two, within the hour so
barely civil to each other, endeavouring now to be ultra~
agreeable. Will, as soon as he had taken breath (along, deep
gasp of admiration) after Margaret’s song, sidled up to Job,
and asked him in a sort of doubting tone,

“You wouldn’t like a live Manx cat, would ye, master?”

“Awhat?” exclaimed Job.

“J don’t know its best name,” said Will, humbly. “But
‘we call ’em just Manx cats. They ’re cats without tails.””

Now Job, inall his natural history, had never heard of
such animals; so Will continued,

“Because I'm going afore joining my ship, to see mother’s
friends in the island, and would gladly bring you one, if so be
you'd like to have it. They look as queer, and out 0’ nature
as flying fish, or” —he gulped the words down that should
have followed. ‘Especially when you see ’em walking a roof-
top, right again the sky, when a cat, as is a proper cat, is sure
to stick her tail stiff out behind, like a slack rope dancer a-ba-
lancing; but these cats having no tail, cannot stick it out,
which captivates some people uncommonly. Ifyo’ll allow
me, I’ll bring one for Miss there,” jerking his head at Mar-
garet. Job assented with grateful curiosity, wishing much to
see the tail-less phenomenon.

“When are you going to sail?” asked Mary.

“I cannot justly say; our ship ’s bound for America next
voyage, they tell me. A mess-mate will let me know when her

 


 

 

176
shelter she could meet with, houseless and pennyless as
she was, on that dreary day.

But it was but for an instant that she stood there doubting.
One thought had haunted her both by night and by day, with
monomaniacal incessancy; and that thought was how to save
Mary (her dead sister’s only child, her own little pet in the
days of her innocence) from following in the same downward
path to vice. To whom could she speak and ask for aid? She
shrank from the idea of addressing John Barton again; her
heart sank within her, at the remembrance of his fierce re-
pulsing action, and far fiercer words. It seemed worse than
death to reveal her condition to Mary, else she sometimes
thought that this course would be the most terrible, the most
efficient warning. She must speak; to that she was soul-
compelled; but to whom? She dreaded addressing any of
her former female acquaintance, even supposing they had
sense, or spirit, or interest enough to undertake her mission.

To whom shall the outcast prostitute tell her tale! Who
will give her help in the day of need? Here is the leper-sin,
and all stand aloof dreading to be counted unclean.

In her wild night wanderings, she had noted the haunts
and habits of many a one who little thought of a watcher in
the poor forsaken woman. You may easily imagine that a
double interest-was attached by her, to the ways and com-
panionships of those with whom she had been acquainted in
the days which, when present, she had considered hardly-
worked and monotonous, but which now in retrospection
seemed so happy and unclouded. Accordingly, she had, as
we have seen, known where to meet with John Barton on
that unfortunate night, which had only produced irritation in
him, and a month’s imprisonment to her. She had also ob-
served that he was still intimate with the Wilsons. She had
seen him walking and talking with both father and son; her
old friends too; and she had shed unregarded, unvalued
tears, when some one had casually told her of George Wil-
son’s sudden death. It now flashed across her mind that to
the son, to Mary’s playfellow, her elder brother in the@ays

 

 

 

 

 

 


 

 

 

 

188

The same state of feeling which John Barton entertained, if
belonging to one who had had leisure to think of such things, and
physicians to give names to them, would have been called mono-
mania; so haunting, so incessant, were the thoughts that pressed
upon him. I have somewhere read a forcibly described punish-
ment among the Italians, worthy ofa Borgia. The supposed or
real criminal was shut up in aroom, supplied with every conve-
nience and luxury; and at first mourned little over his imprison-
ment. But day by day he became aware that the space between
the walls of his apartment was narrowing, and then he understood
the end. Those painted walls would come into hideous nearness,
and at last crush the life out of him.

And so day by day, nearer and nearer, came the diseased
thoughts of John Barton. They excluded the light of heaven, the
cheering sounds of earth. They were preparing his death.

It is true, much of their morbid power might be ascribed to
the use of opium. But before you blame too harshly this use, or
rather abuse, try a hopeless life, with daily cravings of the
body for food. ‘Try, not alone being without hope yourself,
but seeing all around you reduced to the same despair, arising
from the same circumstances; all around you telling (though
they use no'words or language), by their looks and feeble actions,
that they are suffering and sinking under the pressure of want.
Would you not be glad to forget life, and its burdens? And
opium gives forgetfulness for.a time.

It is true they who thus purchase it pay dearly for their obli-
vion; but can you expect the uneducated to count the cost of their
whistle? Poor wretches! They pay a heavy price. Days of oppres-
sive weariness and languor, whose realities have the feeble sickli-
nessof dreams; nights, whose dreamsare fierce realities of agony;
sinking health, tottering frames, incipient madness, and worse,
the consciousness of incipient madness; this is the price of their
whistle. But have you taught them the science of consequences?

John Barton’s overpowering thought, which was to work out
his fate on earth, was rich and poor; why are they so separate, 80
distinct, when God has made themall? It is not His will, that
their interests are so far apart. Whose doing is it?

And so on into the problems and mysteries of life, until, be-

worse. AndI’m afeard it was true; yet I were loth to go without
knowing where to send the money .... So that kept me beyond
my time, chaps.”

“Did you hear where the wife lived at last?” asked many
anxious voices. :

“No! he went on talking to her, till his words cut my heart
like a knife. I axed th’ nurse to find out who she was, and where
she lived. But what I’m more especial naming it now for is
this, — for one thing I wanted you all to know why I weren't at
my post this morning; for another, I wish to say, that I, for
one, ha’ seen enough of what comes of attacking knob-sticks, and
I'll ha’ nought to do with it no more.”

There were some expressions of disapprobation, but John
did not mind them.

“Nay! I’m no coward,” he replied, “and I’m true to th’
backbone. WhatI would like, and what I would do, would be
to fight the masters. There ’s one among yo called me a coward.
‘Well! every man has a right to his opinion; but since I’ve
thought on th’ matter to-day, I’ve thought we han all on us
been more like cowards in attacking the poor like ourselves;
them as has none to help, but mun choose between vitriol and
starvation. I say we’re more cowardly in doing that than in
leaving them alone. No! what I would do is this. Have at the
masters!” Again he shouted, “Have at the masters!”” He spoke
lower; all listened with hushed breath.

“It’s the masters as has wrought this woe; it’s the masters
as should pay for it. Him as called me coward just now, may
try if Iam one or not, Set me to serve out the masters, and see
if there ’s ought I ’ll stick at.”

“It would give the masters a bit on a fright if one on them were
beaten within an inch of his life,” said one.

“‘Ay! or beaten till no life were left in him,” growled an-
other.

And so with words, or looks that told more than words, they
built up a deadly plan. Deeper and darker grew the import
of their speeches, as they stood hoarsely muttering their meaning
out, and glaring, with eyes that told the terror their own
thoughts were to them, upon their neighbours. Their clenched

““And I am, Mary! I’m come to say good-bye; and few
folk like to say good-bye to them they love.”

“Good-bye! Bless me, Will! that’s sudden, isn’t it?”

Mary left off ironing, and came and stood near the fire-place.
She had always liked Will; but now it seemed as if a sudden
spring of sisterly love had gushed up in her heart, so sorry did
she feel to hear of his approaching departure.

“It’s very sudden, isn’t it?” said she, repeating the ques-
tion.

“Yes, it’s very sudden,” said he, dreamily. “No, it
isn’t;”” rousing himself, to think of what he was saying. “The
captain told me in 8 fortnight he would be ready to sail again;
butit comes very sudden on me, Ihad got so fond of you all.”

Mary understood the particular fondness that was thus gene-
ralised. She spoke again.

“But it’s not a fortnight since you came. Nota fortnight
since you knocked at Jane Wilson’s door, and I was there, you
remember. Nothing like a fortnight!”

“No; I know it's not. But, you see, I got a letter this
afternoon from Jack Harris, to tell me our ship sails on Tuesday
next; and it’s long since I promised my uncle (my mother’s
brother, him that lives at Kirk-Christ, beyond Ramsay, in the
Isle of Man) that I’d go and see him and his, this time of coming
ashore. I must go. I’m sorry enough; but I mustn't slight
poor mother’s friends. Imust go. Don’t try to keep me,” said
he, evidently fearing the strength of his own resolution, if hard
pressed by entreaty.

“I’m not a-going, Will. I dare say you’re right; only I
can’t help feeling sorry you ’re going away. It seems s0 flat to
beleft behind. When do you go?”

“To-night. I shan’t see you again.”

“To-night! and you go to Liverpool! May be you and
father will go together. He’s going to Glasgow, by way of
Liverpool.”

“No! I’m walking; and I don’t think your father will be up
to walking.”

“Well! and why on earth are you walking? You can get b;
railway for three-and-sixpence.” _ seer

And her voice! When [hear it, and think of the wishes that are
in my heart, it seems as much out of place to ask her to be my
wife, as it would be to ask an angel from heaven.”

Mary could not help laughing outright, in spite of her de-
pression, at the idea of Margaret as.an angel; it was so difficult
(even to her dress-making imagination), to fancy where, and
how, the wings would be fastened to the brown stuff gown, or
the blue and yellow print.

Will laughed, too, a little, out of sympathy with Mary’s
pretty merry laugh. ‘Then he said —

“Ay, you may laugh, Mary; it only shows you ‘ve never
been in love.”

In an instant Mary was carnation colour, and the tears sprang
to her soft gray eyes. She that was suffering so much from the
doubts arising from love! It was unkind of him. He did not
notice her change of look and of complexion. He only noticed
that she was silent, so he continued:

“I thought — I think, that when I come back from this
voyage, Iwill speak. It’s my fourth voyage in the same ship and
with the same captain, and he’s promised he ‘ll make me a
second mate after this trip, then I shall have something to offer
Margaret; and her father, and aunt Alice, shall live with her,
and keep her from being lonesome while I’m at sea. I’m speak-
ing as if she cared for me, and would marry me; d’ye think she
does care at all for me, Mary?” asked he, anxiously.

Mary had a very decided opinion of her own on the subject,
but she did not feel as if she had any right to give it. So she
said —

“You must ask Margaret, not me, Will; she ’s nevernamed
your name to me.” His countenance fell. “But I should say
‘that was a good sign from a girl like her; I’ve no right to say
what I think; but, ifI was you, I would not leave her now with-
out speaking.”

“No! I cannot speak! I have tried. I’ve been in to wish
them good-bye, and my voice stuck in my throat. Icould say
nought of what I ’d planned to say; and I never thought of being
80 bold as to offer her marriage till I’d been my next trip, and
been made mate. I could not even offer her this box,” said he,

 


 

 

218

too. But no! Job seemed imperturbable. So much the better,
and perhaps she could cover her father’s rudeness by her own
civility to so kind a friend.

So half listening to her father’s movements up-stairs (pas-
sionate, violent, restless motions they were), and half attending
to Job Legh, she tried to pay him all due regard.

“When does your father start, Mary?”

‘That plaguing question again.

“Oh! very soon. I’m just getting him a bit of supper. Is
Margaret very well?”

“Yes, she’s well enough. She’s meaning to go and keep
Alice Wilson company for an hour or so this evening; as soon as
she thinks her nephew will have started for Liverpool; for she
fancies the old woman will feel a bit lonesome. Th’ Union is
paying for your father, I suppose?”

“Yes, they ’ve giv'n him a sovereign. You|'re one of th’
Union, Job?”

“Ay! I’m one, sure enough; but I’m but sleeping partner
inthe concern. Iwere obliged to become a member for peace,
else I don’t go along with em. Yo see they think themselves
wise, and me silly, for differing with them! well! there ’s no
harm in that. But then they won't let me be silly in peace and
quietness, but will force me to be as wise as they are; now
that ’s not British liberty, Isay. I’m forced to be wise accord-
ing to their notions, else they parsecute me, and sarve me out.””

‘What could her father be doing up-stairs? Tramping and
banging about. Why did he not come down? Or why did not
Job go? The supper would be spoilt.

But Job had no notion of going.

“You see my folly is this, Mary. Iwould take what I could
get; I think half a loafis better than no bread. I would work for
low wages rather than sit idle and starve. But, comes the Trades’
Union, and says, ‘Well, if you take the half-loaf, we ‘ll worry
you out of your life. Will you be clemmed, or will you be
worried?’ Now clemming is a quiet death, and worrying isn’t,
so I choose clemming, and come into th’ Union. But I wish

they'd leave me free, if ama fool.”

judgment. One moment he does not think there ’s much hope —
‘but while there is life there is hope; th’ next he says he should
think she might recover partial, but her age is again her. He’s
ordered her leeches to her head.”

Margaret having told her tale, leant back with weariness,
both of body and mind. Mary hastened to make her a cup of
tea; while Job, lately so talkative, sat quiet and mournfully
silent.

“Ill go first thing to-morrow morning, and learn how she
is; and I'll bring word back before I go to work,” said Mary.

. “It’s a bad job Will ’s gone,” said Job.

“Jane does not think she knows any one,” replied Margaret.
“It's perhaps as well he shouldn’t see her now, for they say her
face is sadly drawn. He ’ll remember her with her own face
better, if he does not see her again.”

With a few more sorrowful remarks they separated for the
night, and Mary was left alone in her house, to meditate on the
heavy day that had passed over her head. Every thing seemed
going wrong. Will gone; her father gone — and so strangely
too! And to a place so mysteriously distant as Glasgow seemed.
to be to her! She had felt his presence as a protection against
Harry Carsons and his threats; and now she dreaded lest he
should learn she was alone. Her heart began to despair, too,
about Jem. She feared he had ceased to love her; and she —
she only loved him more and more for his seeming neglect. And,
as if all this aggregate of sorrowful thoughts was not enough,
here was this new woe, of poor Alice’s paralytie stroke.

CHAPTER XVIIE.
“But in his pulse there was no throb,
Nor on his lips one dying sob ;
Sigh, nor word, nor struggling breath.

Heralded his way to death.” Seca or Conintn,
“My brain runs this way and that way; "t will not fix
On aught but vengeance.” Doge oF Gorse.

I must now go back to an hour er two before Mary and her
friends parted for the night. It might be about eight o’clock that
ening, and the three Miss Carsons were sitting in their father’s

 

 

 

226

to articulate, choked by the convulsive rising in her throat. They
clustered round her with eager faces, catching a glimpse of some
terrible truth to be revealed.

“My doar young ladies! my dear girls,” she‘gasped out at
length, and then she burst into tears.

“Oh! do tell us what itis, nurse,” said one. “Any, thing is
better than this. Speak!””

“My children! I don’t know how to break it to you. My dears,
poor Mr. Harry is brought home —”

“Brought home — brought home — how?” Instinctively
they sank their voices to a whisper; but a fearful whisper it was.
In the same low tone, as if afraid lest the walls, the furniture, the
inanimate things which told of preparation for life and comfort,
should hear, she answered,

“Dead!”

Amy clutched her nurse’s arm, and fixed her eyes on her as
if to know if such a tale could be true; and when she read its con-
firmation in those sad, mournful, unflinching eyes, she sank,
without word or sound, down in a faint upon the floor. One sister
sat down on an ottoman, and covered her face, to try and realise
it. That was Sophy. Helen threw herself on the sofa, and bury-
ing her head in the pillows, tried to stifle the screams and moans
which shook her frame.

‘The nurse stood silent. She had not told all.

“Tell me,” said Sophy, looking up, and speaking in a hoarse
voice, which told of the inward pain, “tell me, nurse! Is he
dead, didyousay? Have you sent fora doctor? Oh! send for
one, send for one,” continued she, her voice rising to shrillness,
and starting to her feet. Helen lifted herself up, and looked, with
breathless waiting, towards nurse.

“My dears, heis dead! But Ihave sent foradoctor. Ihave
done all I could.”

“When did he — when did they bring him-home?” asked
Sophy. .

«Perhaps ten minutes ago. Before you rang for Parker.”

“How did he die? Where did they find him? He looked so
well. He always seemed so strong. Oh! are you sure he is déad?”

She went towards the door. Nurse laid her hand on her arm

twenty yards off. That he had even been startled when close to
the body, by seeing it lying across the path at his feet. Thathe
had sprung his rattle; and when another policeman came up, by
the light of the lantern they had discovered who it was that had
beenkilled. That they believed him to be dead when they first
took him up, as he had never moved, spoken, or breathed.
‘That intelligence of the murder had been sent to the superinten-
dent who would probably soon be here. ‘That two or three po-
licemen were still about the place where the murder was com-
mitted, secking out for some trace of the murderer. Having said
this, they stopped speaking.

Mr. Carsons had listened attentively, never taking his eyes
ofthe dead body. When they had ended he said,

“Where was he shot?”

They lifted up some of the thick chesnut curls and showed a
blue spot (you could hardly call it a hole, the flesh had
closed so much over it) inthe left temple. A deadly aim! And
yet it was so dark a night!

“He must have been close upon him,” said one policeman.

“ And have had him between him and the sky,” added the
other.

There was a little commotion at the door of the room, and
there stood poor Mrs. Carsons, the mother.

She had heard unusual noises in the house, and had sent
down her maid (much more # companion to her than her highly
educated daughters) to discover what was going on. But the
maid either forgot, or dreaded, to return; and with nervous
impatience Mrs. Carsons came down herself, and had traced the
hum and buzz of voices to the servants’ hall. |

Mr. Carsons turned round. But he could not leave the dead
for any one living.

“Take her away, nurse. It is no sightforher. Tell Miss
Sophy to go to her mother.”” His eyes were again fixed on the
dead face of his son.

Presently Mrs. Carsons’ hysterical cries were heard all over
the house. Her husband shuddered at the outward expression of
the agony which was rending his heart.

Then the police superintendent came, ond after him the

 


 

234

 

dead; when the door opened, and Mr. Carsons returned. Stern
as he had looked before leaving the room, he-looked far sterner
now. His face was hardened into deep-purposed wrath.

“I beg your pardon, Sir, for leaving you.” ‘The superin-
tendent bowed. ‘They sat down, and spoke long together. One
by one the policemen were called in, and questioned.

All through the night there was bustle and commotion in the
house. Nobody thought of going to bed. It seemed strange to
Sophy to hear nurse summoned from her mother’s side to supper,
in the middle of the night, and still stranger that she could go.
‘The necessity of eating and drinking seemed out of place in the
house of death.

When night was passing into morning, the dining-room door
opened, and two persons’ steps were heard along the hall. The
superintendent was leaving at last. Mr. Carsons stood on the
front door-step, feeling the refreshment of the cooler morning
air, and seeing the starlight fade away into dawn.

“You will not forget,” said he. “I trust to you.” The po-
liceman bowed.

“Spare no money. The only purpose for which I now value
wealth is to have the murderer arrested, and brought to justice.
‘My hope in life now is to see him sentenced to death. Offer any
rewards. Name a thousand pounds in the placards. Come to
me at any hour, night or day, if that berequired. AllI ask of
you, is, togetthe murderer hanged. Next week, if possible—
to-day is Friday. Surely with the clues you already possess, you
can muster up evidence sufficient to have him tried next week.”

“He may easily request an adjournment of his trial, on
the ground of the shortness of the notice,” said the superin-
tendent.

“Oppose it, if possible. I will see that the first lawyers are
employed. I shall know no rest while he lives.”

“Every thing shall be done, Sir.”

“You will arrange with the coroner. Ten o'clock, if con-
venient.”

‘The superintendent took leave.

‘Mr. Carsons stood on the step, dreading to shut out the light

and air, and return into the haunted, gloomy house.

bench in the aisle, and how it were the first butterfly we'd seen
this spring, and how it flew into th’ very church itself; oh! mo-
ther is so gentle, I wish we'd told her. I'll go to her next time
she comes in sight, and say, ‘Mother, we were naughty last
sabbath.’””

She stopped, and a few tears came stealing down the old
withered cheek, at the thought of the temptation and deceit of
her childhood. Surely, many sins could not have darkened that
innocent child-like spirit since. Mary found a red-spotted
pocket-handkerchief, and put it into the hand, which sought
about for something to wipe away the trickling tears. She took
it, with a gentle murmur.

“Thank you, mother.”

Mary pulled Margaret away from the bed.

“Don’t you think she ’s happy, Margaret?”

“Ay! that I do, bless her. She feels no pain, and knows
nought of her present state. Oh! thatI could see, Mary! Itry
and be patient with her afore me, but I’d give aught Ihave to
see her, and see what she wants. I am so useless! I mean to
stay here as long as Jane Wilson is alone; and I would fain be
here all to-night, but —”

“Tl come,” said Mary, decidedly.

“Mrs. Davenport said’ she ’d come again, but she ’s hard-
worked all day —”

“J'll come,” repeated Mary.

“Do!” said Margaret, “andII’ll be here till you come. May
be, Jem and you could take th’ night between you, and Jane
Wilson might get a bit of sound sleep in his bed; for she were up
and down the better part of last night, and just when she were in

_ sound sleep this morning, between.two and three, Jem came
home, and th’ sound o’ his voice roused her in a minute.”

«Where had he been till that time o’ night?” asked Mary.

“Nay! it were none of my business; and, indeed, I never
saw him till he came in here to see Alice. He were in again this
morning, and seemed sadly downcast. But you ’ll, may be,
manage to comfort him to-night, Mary,” said Margaret, smiling,
while a ray of hope glimmered in Mary’s heart, and she almost

felt glad, for an instant, of the occasion which would at last




 

 

244

farther inquiry, she fell off into another doze, feverish, dream-
haunted, and unrefreshing.

Meanwhile, the policeman walked off with his prize, with an
odd mixture of feelings; a little contempt, a little disappoint-
ment, and a good deal of pity. The contempt and the dis-
appointment were caused by the widow’s easy admission of the
gun being her son’s property, and her manner of identifying it
by the ornaments. He liked an attempt to baffle him; he was
accustomed to it, it gave some exercise to his wits and his
shrewdness. There would be no fun in fox-hunting, if Reynard
yielded himself up without any effort to escape. Then, again,
his mother’s milk was yet in him, policeman, officer of the
Detective Service though he was; and he felt sorry for the old
woman, whose “softness” had given such material assistance
in identifying her son as the murderer. However, he conveyed
the gun, and the intelligence he had gained, to the superinten-
dent; and the result was, that, ina short time afterwards, three
policemen went to the works at which Jem was foreman, and
announced their errand to the astonished overseer, who directed
them to the part of the foundry where Jem was then superintend-
ing a casting.

Dark, black were the walls, the ground, the faces around
them, as they crossed the yard. But, in the furnace-house a
deep and lurid red glared over all; the furnace roared with
mighty flame. The men, like demons, in their fire-and-soot
colouring, stood swart around, awaiting the moment when the
tons of solid iron should have melted down into fiery liquid, fit
to be poured, with still, heavy sound, into the delicate moulding
of fine black sand, prepared to receive it. The heat was intense,
and the red glare grew every instant more fierce; the policemen
stood awed with the novel sight. ‘Then, black figures, holding
strange-shaped bucket shovels, came athwart the deep-red
furnace light, and clear and brilliant flowed forth the iron into
the appropriate mould. The buzz of voices rose again; there
was time to speak, and gasp, and wipe the brows; and then,
one by one, the men dispersed to some other branch of their
employment.

No. B. 72, pointed out Jem as the man he had seen engaged

 

 

 

 

 

248

from the in-door to the out-door atmosphere, seemed to alter
the current of her thoughts. She thought less of the dreadful
subject which had so haunted her all day; she cared less for the
upbraiding speeches of her fellow-workwomen; the old associa-
tion of comfort and sympathy received from Alice gave her the
idea that, even now, her bodily presence would soothe and com-
pose those who were in trouble, changed, unconscious, and
absent though her spirit might be.

‘Then, again, she reproached herself a little for the feeling
of pleasure she experienced, in thinking that he whom she
dreaded could never more beset her path; inthe security with
which she could pass each street corner — each shop, where he
used to lie in ambush. Oh! beating heart! was there no other
little thought of joy lurking within, to gladden the very air
without? Was she not going to meet, to see, to hear Jem; and
could they fail at last to understand each other’s loving hearts!

She softly lifted the latch, with the privilege of friendship.
He was not there, but his mother was standing by the fire, stirring
some little mess or other. Never mind! he would come soon:
and with an unmixed desire to do her graceful duty to all belong-
ing to him, she stepped lightly forwards, unheard by the old
lady, who was partly occupied by the simmering, bubbling
sound of her bit of cookery; but more with her own sad thoughts,

~ and wailing, half-uttered murmurings.

Mary took off bonnet and shawl with speed, and advancing,
made Mrs. Wilson conscious of her presence, by saying,

“Let me do that for you. I’m sure you mun be tired.”

Mrs. Wilson slowly turned round, and her eyes gleamed like
those of'a pent-up wild beast, as she recognised her visitor.

“ And is it thee that dares set foot in this house, after what
has come to pass? Is it not enotigh to have robbed me of my
boy with thy arts and thy profligacy, but thou must come here to
crow over me—me—his mother? Dost thou know where he
is, thou bad hussey, with thy great blue eyes and yellow hair,
to lead men on to ruin? Out upon thee with thy angel’s face,
thou whited sepulchre. Dost thou know where Jem is, all
through thee?”

‘No!” quivered out poor Mary, scarcely conscious that she

 

 

 

252

on the long curled eye-lashes. With his soft voice, and pleading
looks, he uttered, in his pretty broken English, the word

“Hungry! so hungry.”

And, as if to aid by gesture the effect of the solitary word,
he pointed to his mouth, with its white quivering lips.

‘Mary answered him impatiently,

“Oh, lad, hunger is nothing — nothing!”

And she rapidly passed on. But her heart upbraided her the
next minute with her unrelenting speech, and she hastily entered
her door and seized the scanty remnant of food which the cup-
board contained, and she retraced her steps to the place where
the little hopeless stranger had sunk down by his mute compa-
nion in loneliness and starvation, and was raining down tears as
he spoke in some foreign tongue, with low cries for the far
distant “Mamma mia!”

With the elasticity of heart belonging to childhood he sprang
up as he saw the food the girl brought; she whose face, lovely
in its woe, had tempted him first to address her; and, with the
graceful courtesy of his country, he looked up and smiled while
he kissed her hand, and then poured forth his thanks, and
shared her bounty with his little pet companion. She stood an
instant, diverted from the thought of her own grief by the sight
of his infantine gladness; and then bending down and kissing
his smooth forehead, she left him, and sought to be alone with
her agony once more.

She re-entered the house, locked the door, and tore off her
bonnet, as if greedy of every moment which took her from the
full indulgence of painful, despairing thought.

Then she threw herself on the ground, yes, on the hard
flags she threw her soft limbs down; and the comb fell out of her
hair, and those bright tresses swept the dusty floor, while she
pillowed and hid her face on her arms, and burst forth into hard,
suffocating sobs.

Oh, earth! thou didst seem but a dreary dwelling-place for
thy poor child that night. None to comfort, none to pity! And
self-reproach gnawing at her heart.

Oh, why did she ever listen to the tempter? Why did she
ever give ear to her own suggestions, and cravings after wealth

253

and grandeur? Why had she thought it a fine thing to have a
rich lover?

She — she had deserved it all; but he was the victim, — he
the beloved. She could not conjecture, she could not even
pause to think who had revealed, or how he had discovered her
acquaintance with Harry Carsons. It was but too clear, some
way or another, he had learnt all; and what would he think
ofher? No hope of his love, — oh, that she would give up, and
be content; it was his life, his precious life, that was threatened?
‘Then she tried to recall the particulars, which, when Mrs. Wil-
son had given them, had fallen but upon a deafened ear, —
something about a gun, a quarrel, which she could not remember
clearly. Oh, how terrible to think of his crime, his blood-
guiltiness; he who had hitherto been so good, so noble, and
now an assassin! And then she shrank from him in thought; and
then, with bitter remorse, clung more closely to his image with
passionate self-upbraiding. Was it not she who had led him to
the pit into which he had fallen? Was she toblamehim? She
to judge him? Who could tell how maddened he might have
been by jealousy; how one moment's uncontrollable passion
might have led him to become a murderer! And she had blamed
him in her heart after his last deprecating, imploring, prophetic
speech!

‘Then she burst out crying afresh; and when weary of crying,
fell to thinking again. The gallows! The gallows! Black it
stood against the burning light which dazzled her shut eyes,
press on them as she would. Oh! she was going mad; and for
awhile she lay outwardly still, but with the pulses careering
through her head with wild vehemence.

‘And then came a strange forgetfulness of the present, in
thought of the long-past times; — of those days when she hid her
face on her mother’s pitying, loving bosom, and heard tender
words of comfort, be her grief or her error what it might; — of
those days when she had felt as if her mother’s love was too
mighty not to last for ever; — of those days when hunger had
been to her (as to the little stranger she had that evening re-
lieved) something to be thought about, and mourned over; —
when Jem and she had played together; he, with the condescen-

 

 

waiting for his victim. There was no sign, however, that any
one had been about the place. Ifthe grass had been bruised or
bent where he had trod, it had had enough of the elasticity of
life to raise itself under the dewy influences of night. She hushed
her breath in involuntary awe, but nothing else told of the violent,
deed by which a fellow-creature had passed away. She stood still
for a minute, imagining to herself the position of the parties,
guided by the only circumstance which afforded any evidence,
the trailing mark on the dust in the road.

Suddenly (it was before the sun had risen above the horizon)
she became aware of something white in the hedge. All other
colours wore the same murky hue, though the forms of objects
were perfectly distinct. What was it? It could not bea flower; —
that, the time of year made clear. A frozen lump of snow, linger-
ing late in one of the gnarled tufts of the hedge? She stepped
forwards to examine. It proved to be alittle piece of stiff writin,
paper compressed into a round shape. She understood it in-
stantly; it was the paper that had served as wadding for the
murderer's gun. Then she had been standing just where the
murderer must have been but a few hours before; probably (as
the rumour had spread through the town, reaching her ears) one
of the poor maddened turn-outs, who hung about everywhere,
with black, fierce looks, as if contemplatiug some deed of
violence. Her sympathy was all with them, for she had known
what they suffered; and besides this there was her own individual
dislike of Mr. Carsons, and dread of him for Mary’s sake. Yet,
poor Mary! Death was terrible, though sure, remedy for the
evil Esther had dreaded for her; and how would she stand the
shock, loving as her aunt believed her todo? Poor Mary! who
would comfort her? Esther's thoughts began to picture her sor-
row, her despair, when the news of her lover's death should
reach her; and she longed to tell her there might have been a .
keener grief yet had he lived.

Bright, beautiful came the slanting rays of thé morning sun.
It was time for such as she to hide themselves,, with.the other
obscene things of night, from the glorious light of day, which
was only for the happy. So she turned her steps towards town,
still holding the paper. But in getting over the hedge it en-

She had longed to open her wretched, wretched heart, so
hopeless, so abandoned by all living things, to one who had
loved her once; and yet she refrained, from dread of the averted
eye, the altered voice, the internal loathing, which she feared
such disclosure might create. She would go straight to the sub-
ject of the day. She could not tarry long, for she felt unable
to support the character she had assumed for any length of time.

They sat by the little round table, facing each other. The
candle was placed right between them, and Esther moved it in
order to have a clearer view of Mary’s face, so that she might
read her emotions, and ascertain her interests. Then she began:

“It’s a bad business, I’m afraid, this of Mr. Carsons’

| murder.”

Mary winced alittle.

“I hear Jem Wilson is taken up for it.””

Mary covered her eyes with her hands, as if to shade them
from the light, and Esther herself, less accustomed to self-
command, was getting too much agitated for calm observation
of another.

“I was taking a walk near Turner Street, and I went to see
the spot,” continued Esther, “and, as luck would have it, I
spied this bit of paper in the hedge,” producing the precious
piece still folded in her hand. “It has been used as wadding
for the gun, Ixreckon; indeed, that’s clear enough, from the
shape it's crammed into. I was sorry for the murderer, whoever
he might be (I didn’t then know of Jem’s being suspected), and
I thought I would never leave a thing about,| as might help, if
ever so little, to convict him; the police are so ‘cute about
straws. So I carried it a little way, and then I opened it, and
saw your name, Mary.”

Mary took her hands away from her eyes, and looked with
surprise at her aunt's face, as she uttered these words. She
was kind after all, for was she not saving her from being sum-
moned, and from being questioned, and examined; a thing to
be dreaded above all others: as she felt sure that her um
answers, frame them how she might, would add to the suspicions

against Jem; her aunt was indeed kind, to think of what would
spare her this.

remained shaded only by the curtains hastily drawn together on
Esther’s entrance, and the lighting of the candle.

She did all this with the same compressed lips, and the same
stony look that her face had assumed on the first examination of
the paper. Then she sat down for an instant to think; and rising
directly, went, with a step rendered firm by inward resolution of
purpose, up the stairs; — passed her own door, two steps, into
her father’s room. What did she want there?

I must tell you; I must put into words the dreadful secret
which she believed that bit of paper had revealed to her.

Her father was the murderer!

That corner of stiff, shining, thick writing-paper, she re-
cognised as a part of the sheet on which she had copied Samuel
Bamford’s beautiful lines so many months ago — copied (as you
perhaps remember) on the blank part of a valentine sent to her
by Jem Wilson, in those days when she did not treasure and
hoard up every thing he had touched, as she would do now.

‘That copy had been given to her father for whom it was made,
and she had occasionally seen him reading it over, not a fort-
night ago she was sure. Butshe resolved to ascertain if the other
part still remained in his possession. He might, it was just
possible he might, have given it away to some friend; and if so,
that person was the guilty one, for she could swear to the paper
anywhere,

First of all she pulled out every article fromthe little old chest
of drawers. Amongst them were some things which had belonged
to her mother, but she had no time now to examine and try and
remember them. All the reverence she could pay them was to
carry them and lay them on the bed carefully, while the other
things were tossed impatiently out upon the floor.

The copy of Bamford’s lines was not there. Oh! perhaps he
might have given it away; but then must it not have been to
Jem? It was his gun.

And she set to with redoubled vigour to examine the deal-box
which served as chair, and which had once contained her father’s
Sunday clothes, in the days when he could afford to have Sun-
day clothes.

He had redeemed his better coat from the pawn-shop before

 

268

surrounded her, the arid depths of whose gloom she dared not
venture to contemplate, a little spring of comfort was gushing up
at her feet, unnoticed at first, but soon to give her strength and
hope.

And that was the necessity for exertion on her part which this
discovery enforced.

Oh! I do not think that the necessity for exertion, for some
kind of action (bodily or mentally) in time of distress, is a most
infinite blessing, although the first efforts at such seasons are
painful. Something to be done implies that there is yet hope of
some good thing to be accomplished, or some additional evil that
may be avoided; and by degrees the hope absorbs much of the
sorrow.

It is the woes that cannot in any earthly way be escaped that
admit least earthly comforting. Of all trite, worn-out, hollow
mockeries of comfort that were ever uttered by people who will
not take the trouble of sympathising with others, the one I dislike
the most is the exhortation not to grieve over an event, ‘for it
cannot be helped.” Do you think ifI could help it, I would sit,
still with folded hands, content to mourn? Do you not believe
that as long as hope remained I would be up and doing? I mourn
because what has occurred cannot be helped. ‘The reason you
give me for not grieving, is the very and sole reason of my grief.
Giver me nobler and higher reasons for enduring meekly what
my Father sees fit to send, and I will try earnestly and faith-
fully to be patient; but mock me not, or any other mourner,
with the speech, “Do notgrieve, for it cannot be helped. It is
past remedy.”

But some remedy to Mary’s sorrow came with thinking. If
her father was guilty, Jem was innocent. If innocent, there was
a possibility of saving him. He must be saved. ‘And she must
do it; for, was not she the sole depository of the terrible secret?
Her father was not suspected; and never should be, if by any
foresight or any exertions of her own she could preventit.

She did not yet know how Jem was to be saved, while her
father was also to be considered innocent. It would require
much thought, and much prudence. But with the call upon her
exertions, and her various qualities of judgment and discretion,

the internal trouble. All was so still, so motionless, so hard!
Very different to this lovely night in the country in which I am
now writing, where the distant horizon is soft and undulating in
the moonlight, and the nearer trees sway gently to and fro in the
night-wind with something of almost human motion; and the
rustling air makes music among their branches, as if speaking
soothingly to the weary ones, who lie awake in heaviness of heart.
The sights and sounds of such a night lull pain and grief
torest.

But Mary re-entered her home after she had filled her
pitcher, with a still stronger sense of anxiety, and a still clearer
conviction of how much rested upon her unassisted and friendless
self, alone with her terrible knowledge, in the hard, cold, popu-
lous world.

She bathed her forehead, and quenched her thirst, and then,
with wise deliberation of purpose, went up-stairs, and undressed
herself, as if for a long night’s slumber, although so few hours in-
tervened before day-dawn. She believed she never could sleep,
but she lay down, and shut her eyes; and before many minutes
she was in as deep and sound a slumber as if there was no sin or
sorrow in the world.

She woke up, as it was natural, much refreshed in body; but
with a consciousness of some great impending calamity. She
sat up in bed to recollect, and when she did remember, she sank
down again with all the helplessness of despair. But it was only
the weakness of an instant; for were not the very minutes pre-
cious, for deliberation if not for action?

Before she had finished the necessary morning business of
dressing, and setting her house in some kind of order, she had
disentangled her ravelled ideas, and arranged some kind of a
plan for action. If Jem was innocent (and now, of his guilt,
even his slightest participation in, or knowledge of the murder,
she acquitted him with all her heart and soul), he must have been
somewhere else when the crime was committed; probably with
some others, who might bear witness to the fact, if she only knew
where to find them. Every thing rested on her. She had heard
of an alibi, and believed it might mean the deliverance she
wished to accomplish; but she was not quite sure, and deter-


272

“Oh, God! Then you won't help me, Job, to prove him inno-
cent? Oh! Job, Job; believe me, Jem never did harm to no one.”

“Not afore; — and mind, wench! I don’t over-blame him for
this.” Job relapsed into silence.

Mary thought a moment.

“Well, Job, you'll not refuse me this, I know. I won't
mind what you think, if you ’ll help me as if he was innocent.
Now suppose I know — I knew he was innocent, — it’s only
supposing, Job, — what must Ido to prove it? Tellme, Job!
Isn’t it called an alibi, the getting folk to swear to where he
really was at the time?”

“Best way, if you know ’d him innocent, would be to find
out the real murderer. Some one did it, that’s clear enough.
If it wasn’t Jem, who was it?”

“How canI tell?” answered Mary, in agony of terror, lest
Job’s question was prompted by any suspicion of the truth.

But he was far enough from any such thought. Indeed, he
had no doubt in his own mind that Jem had, in some passionate
moment, urged on by slighted love and jealousy, been the
murderer. And he was strongly inclined to believe, that Mary
was aware of this, only that, too late repentant of her light
conduct which had led to such fatal consequences, she was now
most anxious to save her old playfellow, her early friend, from
the doom awaiting the shedder of blood.

“If Jem ’s not done it, I don’t see as any on us can tell who
did it. We might find out something if we'd time; but they
say he’s to be tried on Tuesday. It’s no use hiding it, Mary;
things looks strong against him.

“I know they do! I know they do! But, oh! Job! isn’t
an alibi a proving where he really was at th’ time of the murder;
and how must I set about an alibi?”

“An alibi is that, sure enough.” He thoughta little. “You
mun ask his mother his doings, and his whereabouts that night;
the knowledge of that will guide you a bit.”

For he was anxious that on another should fall the task of
enlightening Mary on the hopelessness of the case, and he felt
that her own sense would be more convinced by inquiry and
examination than any mere assertion of his.

  

273

Margaret had sat silent and grave all this time. To tell the
truth, she was surprised and disappointed by the disclosure of
Mary’s conduct, with regard to Mr. Henry Carsons. Gentle,
reserved, and prudent herself, never exposed to the trial of
being admired for her personal appearance, and unsusceptible
enough to be in doubt even yet, whether the fluttering, tender,
infinitely-joyous feeling, she was for the first time experiencing,
at sight, or sound, or thought of Will Wilson, was love or not, —
Margaret had no sympathy with the temptations to which loveli-
ness, vanity, ambition, or the desire of being admired, exposes
so many; no sympathy with flirting girls, in short. Then, she
had no idea of the strength of the conflict between will and prin-
ciple in some who were differently constituted from herself.
With her, to be convinced that an action was wrong, was tan-
tamount to a determination not to do so again; and she had little
or no difficulty in carrying out her determination. So she could
not understand how it was that Mary had acted wrongly, and
had felt too much ashamed, inspite of internal sophistry, to
speak of her actions. Margaret considered herself deceived;
felt aggrieved; and, at the time of which I am now telling you,
was strongly inclined to give Mary up altogether, as a girl
devoid of the modest proprieties of her sex, and capable of gross
duplicity, in speaking of one lover as she had done of Jem,
while she was encouraging another in attentions, at best of a
very doubtful character.

But now Margaret was drawn into the conversation. Sud-
denly it flashed across Mary's mind, that the night of the murder
was the very night, or rather the same early morning, that
Margaret had been with Alice. She turned sharp round, with —

“Ob! Margaret, you can tell me; you were there when he
came back that night; were you not? No! you were not; but
you were there not many hours after. Did not you hear where
hhe’d been? He was away the night before, too, when Alice
was first taken; when you were there for your tea. Oh! where
was he, Margaret?”

“I don’t know,” she answered. “Stay! I do remember
something about his keeping Will company, in his walk to Liver-
pool. I can’t justly say what it was,so much happened that night"

Mary Barton.

274

“Tl go to his mother’s,” said Mary, resolutely.

They neither of them spoke, either to advise or dissuade.
Mary felt she had no sympathy from them, and braced up her
soul to act without such loving aid of friendship. She knew that
their advice would be willingly given at her demand, and that
was all she really required for Jem’s sake. Still her courage
failed a little as she walked to Jane Wilson’s, alone in the world
with her secret.

Jane Wilson’s eyes were swelled with crying; and it was sad
to see the ravages which intense anxiety and sorrow had made on
her appearance in four-and-twenty hours. All night long she’
and Mrs. Davenport had crooned over their sorrows, always
recurring, like the burden of an old song, to the dreadest sorrow
of all, which was now impending over Mrs. Wilson. She had
grown — I hardly know what word to use — but, something like
proud of her martyrdom; she had grown to hug her grief; to feel
an, excitement in her agony of anxiety about her boy.

“So, Mary, you're here! Ohi Mary, lass! He ’s to be
tried on Tuesday.”

She fell to sobbing, in the convulsive breath-catching manner
which tells so of much previous weeping.

“Oh! Mrs. Wilson, don’t take on so! We'll get him off,
you 'llsee. Don’t fret; they can’t prove him guilty!”

“But I tell thee they will,” interrupted Mrs. Wilson, half-
irritated at the light way, as she considered it, in which Mary
spoke; and a little displeased that another could hope when she
had almost brought herself to find pleasure in despair.

“Jt may suit thee well,” continued she, “to make light
0’ the misery thou hast caused; but I shall lay his death at
thy door, as long as I live, and die I know he will; and all for
what he never did — no, he never did; my own blessed boy!”

She was too weak to be angry long; her wrath sank away to
feeble sobbing and worn-out moans,

Mary was most anxious to soothe her from any violence of
either grief or anger; she did so want her to be clear in her
recollection; and, besides, her tenderness was great towards
Jem's mother. So she spoke in a low gentle tone the loving
entences, which sound so broken and powerless in repetition

 

276

She looked so piteously in Mary’s face with her miserable
eyes, that Mary felt her heart giving way, and, dreading the
weakness of her powers, which the burst of crying she longed
for would occasion, hastily changed the subject to Alice; and
Jane, in her heart, feeling that there was no sorrow like a
mother’s sorrow, replied,

“She keeps on much the same, thank you. She’s happy,
for she knows nothing of what’s going on; but th’ doctor says
she grows weaker and weaker. Thou ‘It may be like to see her?”

Mary went up-stairs: partly because it is the etiquette in
humble life, to offer to friends a last opportunity of seeing the
dying or the dead, while the same etiquette forbids a refusal of
the invitation; and partly because she longed to breathe, for an
instant, the atmosphere of holy calm, which seemed ever to
surround the pious good old woman. Alice lay, as before,
without pain, or at least any outward expression of it; but
totally unconscious of all present circumstances, and absorbed
in recollections of the days of her girlhood, which were vivid
enough to take the place of reality to her. Still she talked of
green fields, and still she spoke to the long-dead mother and
sister, low-lying in their graves this many a year, as if they
were with her and about her, in the pleasant places where her
youth had passed.

But the voice was fainter, the motions were more languid;
she was evidently passing away; but how happily!

Mary stood for a time in silence, watching and listening.
Then she bent down and reverently kissed Alice’s cheek; and
drawing Jane Wilson away from the bed, as if the spirit of her
who lay there were yet cognizant of present realities, she
whispered a few words of hope to the poor mother, and kissing
her over and over again in a warm, loving’manner, she bade her
good-bye, went a few steps, and then once more came back to
bid her keep up her heart.

And when she had fairly left the house, Jane Wilson felt as
if'a sun-beam had ceased shining into the room.

Yet oh! how sorely Mary’s heart ached; for more and more
the fell certainty came on her that her father was the murderer!
‘She struggled hard not to dwell on this conviction; to think alone

 

278

from the Isle of Man, which he had planned should be on the
Monday; and on the Tuesday all would be made clear — all that
she dared to wish to be made clear.

She had still to collect her thoughts and freshen ther memory
enough to arrange how to meet with Will — for to the chances of
a letter she would not trust; to find out his lodgings when in
Liverpool; to try and remember the name of the ship in which he
was to sail: and the more she considered these points, the more
difficulty she found there would be in ascertaining these minor
but important facts. For you are aware that Alice, whose memory
was clear and strong on all points in which her heart was inter-
ested, was lying in a manner senseless: that Jane Wilson was
(to use her own word, so expressive to a Lancashire ear)
“dazed,”* that is to say, bewildered, lost in the confusion of
terrifying and distressing ‘thoughts; incapable of concentrating
her mind; and at the best of times Will’s proceedings were a
matter of little importance to her (or so she pretended), she was
so jealous of aught which distracted attention from her pearl of
price, her only son Jem. So Mary felt hopeless of obtaining any
intelligence of the sailor's arrangements from her.

‘Then, should she apply to Jem himself! No! she knew him
too well. She felt how thoroughly he must ere now have had it
his power to exculpate himself at another’s expense. And hi:
tacit refusal so to do had assured her of what she had never
doubted, that the murderer. was safe from any impeachment of
his. But then neither would he consent, she feared, to any
steps which might tend to proving himself innocent. At any rate,
she could not consult him. He was removed to Kirkdale, and
time pressed. Already it was Saturday at noon. And even if she
could have gone to him, I believe she would not. She longed to
do all herself, to be his liberator, his deliverer; to win him life,
though she might never regain his lost love by her own exertions.
And oh! how could she’see him to discuss a subject in which both
knew who was the blood-stained man; and yet whose name might
not be breathed by either, so dearly with all his faults, his sins,
was he loved by both.

And his eyes s0 dazed." — Skelton,

“God pity me!” said Mary, faintly, as white as a sheet.

“Nay, wench, never take on so. What yo can say will go little
way either to help or hinder, for folk say he’s certain to be hung;
and sure enough it wast’ other one as was your sweetheart.”

Mary was beyond any pang this speech would have given at
another time. Her thoughts were all busy picturing to herself the
terrible occasion of their next meeting — not as lovers mee;
should they meet!

“Well!” said the neighbour, seeing no use in remaining with
one who noticed her words or her presence so little; “thou ‘It
tell policeman thou ’st getten his precious bit of paper. He
seemed to think I should be for keeping it mysel; he’s th’ first
as has ever misdoubted me about giving messages, or notes.
Good day.”

She left the house, but Mary did not know it. She sat still
with the parchment in her hand.

All at once she started up She would take it to Job Legh,
and ask him to tell her the true meaning, for it could not be that.

So she went, and choked out her words of inquiry.

“It’s asub-pona,” he replied, turning the parchment over
with the air of a connoisseur; for Job loved hard words, and
lawyer-like forms, and even esteemed himself slightly qualified
for a lawyer, from the smattering of knowledge he had picked up
from an odd volume of Blackstone that he had once purchased at
a book-stall.

“A sub-pena — what is that?” gasped Mary, still in suspense.

Job was struck with her voice, her changed, miserable voice,
and peered at her countenance from over his spectacles.

“(A sub-poena is neither more nor less than this, my dear. It’s
asummonsing you to attend, and answer such questions as may
be asked of you regarding the trial of James Wilson, for the
murder of Henry Carsons; that’s the long and short of it, only
more elegantly put, for the benefit of them who knows how to
value-the gift of language. I’ve been at witness before-time
myself; there ’s nothing much to be afeared on; if they are im-
pudent, why, just you be impudent, and give ’em tit for tat.””

“Nothing much to be afeared on!” echoed Mary, butin such
8 different tone.


 

be for answering it wrong; iftthey asked me if Thad seen you on
a Saturday, ora Tuesday, or any day, I should have clean for-
gotten all about it, and say the very thing I should not.”

“Well, well, don’t go for to get such notions into your head;
they 're what they call ‘narvous,’ and talking on ’em does no
good. Here ’s Margaret! bless the wench! Look, Mary, how well
she guides hersel.””

Job fell to watching his grand-daughter, as with balancing,
measured steps, timed almost as if to music, she made her way
across the street.

Mary shrank as if from a cold blast — shrank from Margaret!
The blind girl, with her reserve, her silence, seemed to be a
severe judge; she, listening, would be such a check to the trusting
earnestness of confidence, which was beginning to unlock the
sympathy of Job. Mary knew herself to blame; felt her errors in
every fibre of her heart; but yet she would rather have had them
spoken about, even in terms of severest censure, than have been
treated in the icy manner in which Margaret had received her
that morning.

“Here ’s Mary,” said Job, almost as if he wished to pro-
pitiate his grand-daughter, “come to take a bit of dinner with
us, for I'll warrant she ’s never thought of cooking any for her-
self to-day; and she looks as wan and pale as a ghost.”

Tt was calling out the feeling of hospitality, so strong and
warm in most of those who have little to offer, but whose heart
goes eagerly and kindly with that little. Margaret came towards
Mary with a welcoming gesture, and a kinder manner by far than
she had used in the morning.

“Nay, Mary, thou know’st thou ’st getten nought at home,”
urged Job.

‘And Mary, faint and weary, and with a heart too aching-
fall of other matters to be pertinacious in this, withdrew her
refusal.

They ate their dinner quietly; for to all it was an effort to
speak, and after one or two attempts they had subsided into
silence.

‘When, the meal was ended Job began again on the subject

they all had at heart.

meet him in Liverpool, on that day, and tell him what has hap-
pened, and how poor Jem is in trouble, and that he must prove
an alibi, come Tuesday. All this I can and will do, though
perhaps I don’t clearly know how, just at present. But surely
God will help me. WhenI know I'm doing right, I will have
no fear, but put my trust in Him; for I’m acting for the innocent
and good, and not for my own self, who have done so wrong.
Ihave no fear when I think of Jem, who is so good.”

She stopped, oppressed with the fulness of her heart. Mar-
garet began to love her again; to see in her the same, sweet,
faulty, impulsive, loveable creature she had known in the former
Mary Barton, but with more of dignity, self-reliance, and
purpose.

Mary spoke again.

“Now [know the name of Will’s vessel — the John Cropper;
and I know that she is bound to America. Thatis something to
know. ButI forget, if I ever heard, where he lodges in Liver-
pool. He spoke of his landlady, as a good, trustworthy woman;
but if he named her name, it has slipped my memory. Can you
help me Margaret?”

‘She appealed to her friend calmly and openly, as if perfectly
aware of, and recognising the unspoken tie which bound her and
Will together; she asked her in the same manner in which she
would have asked a wife where her husband dwelt. And Mar-
garet replied in the like calm tone, two spots of crimson on her
cheeks alone bearing witness to any internal agitation.

“He lodges at a Mrs. Jones’s, Milk-House Yard, out of
Nicholas Street. He has lodged there ever since he began to go
to sea; she is a very decent kind of woman, I believe.”

“Well, Mary! I'll give you my prayers,” said Job. “It's
not often I pray regular, though I often speak a word to God,
when I’m either very happy, or very sorry; I’ve catched myself
thanking him at odd hours when I’ve found a rare insect, or had
@ fine day for an out; but I cannot help it, no more thanI can
talking toafriend. But this time I'll pray regular for Jem, and
for you. And so will Margaret, I'll be bound. Still wench!
what think yo of a lawyer? I know one, Mr. Cheshire, who ’s

rather given to th’ insect \ine — and a good kind.o’chap. He and

‘Margaret did not answer for a moment.

“Oh. speaix’ Margaret, said Marr.” with anxious impatience.

“I know nought about law. or elibis.” replied Margaret,
meekly: but. Mary. as grandiather says, arent you building
too mach on what Jane Wilson has toid vou about his going with
Will? Poor soal, she “s gone dazeless, I think. with care, and
watching, and overmach trouble: and who can wonder? Or
Jem may have told her be was going, by way of a blind.”

~You don't know Jem.” said Mary. starting from her seat
in a burried manner. ~or you would not say so.

~I hope I may be wrong: but think. Mary, how much there
is against him. The shot was fired with his gun: he it was as
threatened Mr. Carsons not many days before: he was absent
from bome at that very time. as we know. and, as I ‘m much
afeard, some one will be called on to prove; and there ’s no one
else to share suspicion with him.””

Mary heaved a deep si

“But, Margaret, he did not do it,” Mary again asserted.

‘Margaret looked unconvinced.

“I ean do no good, I see, by saying so, for none on you
believe me, and I won't say so again till Ican prove it. Blonday
morning I ‘ll go to Liverpool. I shall be at hand for the trial.
Oh dear! dear! And I will find Will; and then, Margaret, I
think you ’ll be sorry for being so stabborn about Jem.”

“Don’t fly off, dear Mary, I'd give a deal to be wrong.
And now I’m going to be plain spoken. You ‘ll want money.
‘Them lawyers is no better than a spunge for sucking up money;
let alone your hunting out Will, and your keep in Liverpool,
and what not. You must take some of the mint I ’ve got laid by
in the old tea-pot. You have no right to refuse, for I offer it to
Jem, not to you; it’s for his purposes you ’re to use it.””

“Iknow —Isee. Thank you Margaret; you ’re a kind one,
at any rate. I take it for Jem; and I'll do my very best with it
for hum. Not all, though; don’t think I'll take all. They ‘ll
pay me for my keep. I'll take this,” accepting a sovereign
from the hoard which Margaret produced out of its accustomed
piace inthe cupboard. “Your grandfather will pay the lawyer,

“Well! Mary," said he, on entering, “I’ve secn the lawyer,
not Mr. Cheshire though; trials for murder, it seems, are not his
line o’ business. But he gived me a note to another ’torney; a
fine fellow enough, only too much of a talker; I could hardly get
aword in, he cutme so short. However, I've just been going
over the principal points again to him; may be you saw us? I
wanted him just come over and speak to you himsel, Mary, but
he was pressed for time; and he said your evidence would not be
much either here or there. He's going to the ’sizes first train on
Monday morning, and will see Jem, and hear the ins and
outs from him, and he ’s gived me his address, Mary, and
you and Will are to call on him (Will ’special) on Monday, at two
o'clock. Thou’rt taking it in, Mary; thou’rt to call on him in
Liverpool at two, Monday afternoon?”

Job had reason to doubt if she fully understood him; for all
this minuteness of detail, these satisfactory arrangements, as he
considered them, only seemed to bring the circumstances in
which she was placed more vividly home to Mary. They con-
vinced her that it was real, and not alla dream, as she had sunk
into fancying it for a few minutes, while sitting in the old ac-
customed place, her body enjoying the rest, and her frame sus-
tained by food, and listening to Margaret’s calm voice. The
gentleman she had just beheld would see and question Jem ina
few hours, and what would be the result?

Monday: that was the day after to-morrow, and on Tuesday,
life and death would be tremendous realities to her lover; or else
death would be an awful certainty to her father.

No wonder Job went over his main points again : —

“Monday; at two o'clock mind; and here’s his card. ‘Mr.
Bridgenorth, 41, Renshaw Street, Liverpool.’ He'll be lodging
there.”

Job ceased talking, and the silence roused Mary up do
thank him.

“You're very kind, Job; very. You and Margaret won't
desert me, come what will.””

“Pooh! pooh! wench; don’t lose heart, just as I’m begin-
ning to get it. He seems to think! deal on Will’s evidence.

You're sure, girls, you ’re under no mistake about Will?”

Jane Wilson sat quietly in her chair as Mary entered; so
quietly, as to strike one by the contrast it presented to her usual
bustling, and nervous manner.

She looked very pale and wan; but the quietness was the
thing that struck Mary most. She did not rise as Mary came in,
‘ut sat still and said something in so gentle, so feeble a voice, thas.
Mary did not catch it.

‘Mrs, Davenport, who was there, plucked Mary by the’gown,
and whispered,

“Never heed her; she ’s worn out, and best let alone. I'll
tell you all about it, up-stairs.””

But Mary, touched by the anxious look with which Mrs. Wil-
son gazed at her, as if waiting the answer to some question, went
forward to listen to the speech she was again repeating.

“What is this? will you tell me?”

Then Mary looked, and saw another ominous slip of parch-
ment inthe mother's hand, which she was rolling up and down
in a tremulous manner between her fingers.

Mary’s heart sickened within her; and she could not speak.

“What is it?” she repeated. “Will you tell me?” She still
looked at Mary, with the same child-like gaze of wonder and
patient entreaty.

What could she answer?

“Ttelled ye not to heed her,” said Mrs. Davenport, a little
angrily. “She knows well enough what itis, — too well, belike.
was notin when they sarved it; but Mrs. Heming (her as lives
next door) was, and she spelled out the meaning, and made it
all clear to Mrs. Wilson. It’s a summons to be a witness on
Jem’s trial — Mrs. Heming thinks to swear to the gun; for yo
see, there ’s nobbut® her as can testify to its being his, and she
let on so casily to the policeman that it was his, that there ’s no
getting off her word now. Poor body; she takes it very hard,
Tdare say!”

Mrs. Wilson had waited patiently while this whispered speech
‘was being uttered, imagining, perhaps, that it would end in some
explanation addressed to her. But when both were silent, though

also that Mary, who intended to keep vigil that night in’ the
house of mourning, would find it difficult to divide her attention
in the possible cases that might ensue.

So they laid her, as I said before, on that little pallet-bed;
and, as they were slowly withdrawing from the bed-side, hoping
and praying that she might sleep, and forget for a time her heavy
burden, she looked wistfully after Mary, and whispered,

“You haven’t told me what itis. Whatisit?”

And gazing in her face for the expected answer, her eye-lids
slowly closed, and she fell into a deep, heavy sleep, almost'as
profound a rest as death. .

Mrs. Davenport went her way, and Mary was alone, — for
cannot call those who sleep allies, against the agony of thought
which solitude sometimes brings up.

She dreaded the night before her. Alice might die; the doctor
had that day declared her case hopeless, and not far from death;
and at times the terror, so natural to the young,'not of death, but.
of the remains of the dead, came over Mary; and she bent and
listened anxiously for the long-drawn, pausing breath of the
sleeping Alice.

OrMrs. Wilson might awake in a state which Mary dreaded to
anticipate, and anticipated while she dreaded; — in a state of
complete delirium. Already her senses had been severely stunned
by the fall explanation of what was required of her,— of what she
had to prove against her son, her Jem, her only child, — which
Mary could not doubt the officious Mrs. Heming had given; and
what ifin dreams (that land into which no sympathy nor love can
penetrate with another, either to share its bliss or its agony, —
that land whose scenes are unspeakable terrors, are hidden mys-
teries, are priceless treasures to one alone, — that land where
alone I may see, while yet I tarry here, the sweet lgoks of my
dead child), — what if, in the horrors of her dreams, her brain
should go still more astray, and she should waken crazy with her
visions, and the terrible reality that begot them?

How much worse is anticipation sometimes than reality! How
Mary dreaded that night, and how calmly it passed by! Even
more so than if Mary had not had such claims upon her care!

Anxiety about them deadened her own peculiar anxieties.

 

294

‘When Mary turned from the window, she went to the bed of
each sleeper, to look and listen. Alice looked perfectly quiet
and happy in her slumber, and her face seemed to have become
much more youthful during the painless approach to death.

‘Mrs. Wilson’s countenance was stamped with the anxiety of
the last few days, although she, too, appeared sleeping soundly ;
but as Mary gazed on her, trying to trace a likeness to her son in
her face, she awoke and looked up into Mary’s eyes, while the
expression of consciousness came back into her own.

‘Both were silent for a minute or two. Mary’s eyes had fallen
beneath that penetrating gaze, in which the agony of memory
seemed every minute to find faller vent.

“Ts it adream?” the mother asked at last in a low voice.

“No!” replied Mary, in the same tone.

Mrs. Wilson hid her face in the pillow.

She was fully conscious of every thing this morning; it was
evident that the stunning effect of the subpena, which had af-
fected her so much last night in her weak, worn-out state, had
passed away. Mary offered no opposition when she indicated by
languid gesture and action that she wished to rise. A sleepless
bed is a haunted place.

When she was dressed with Mary's aid, she stood by Alice
for a minute or two looking at the slumberer.

“How happy she is!” said she, quietly and sadly.

All the time that Mary was getting breakfast ready, and per-
forming every other littie domestic office she could think of, to
add to the comfort of Jem’s mother, Mrs. Wilson sat still in the
arm-chair, watching her silently. Her old irritation of temper
and manner seemed to have suddenly disappeared, or perhaps
she was too depressed in body and mind to show it.

told her all that had been done with regard to Mr.
Bridgenorth; all her own plans for seeking out Will; all her
hopes; and concealed as well as she could all the doubts and
fears that would rise unbidden. To this Mrs. Wilson listened
without much remark, but with deep interest and perfect com-
prehension. When Mary ceased she sighed and said, “Oh
wench! Iam his mother, and yet I do so little, I can do so little!
That's what frets me! 1 seem like a child as sees its, mammy ill,

his profession; for it was his delight to see every one around him
in fall enjoyment of life.

However, be subdued his face to the proper expression of
sympathy, befitting a doctor listening to a patient, or a patient’s
friend (and Mary’s-sad, pale, anxious face, might be taken for
either the one, or the other).

“Well, my girl! and what brings you here?” saidhe, ashe
entered his surgery. “Not on your own account, I hope.””

“T wanted you to come and see Alice Wilson, — and then I
thought you would may be take a look at Mrs. Wilson.”

He bustled on his hat and coat, and followed Mary, instantly.

After shaking his head over Alice (as if it was a mournful
thing for one so pure and good, so true, although so humble a,
Christian, to be nearing her desired heaven), and muttering the
accustomed words intended to destroy hope, and prepare anti-
cipation, he went in compliance with Mary’s look to ask the usual
questions of Mrs. Wilson, who sat passively in her arm-chair.

She answered his questions,and submitted to his examination.

“How do you think her?” asked Mary, eagerly.

“Why —a,” began he, perceiving that he was desired to

“take one side in his answer, and unable to find out whether his
listener was anxious for a favourable verdict or otherwise; but.
thinking it most probable that she would desire the former, he
continued,

“She is weak, certainly; the natural result of such a shock
as the arrest of her son would be, — for I understand this James
Wilson, who murdered Mr. Carsons, washer son. Sad thing to
have such a reprobate in the family.”

“You say ‘who murdered,’ Sir!” said Mary, indignantly.
“He is only taken up on suspicion, and many have no doubt
of his innocence — those who know him, Sir.””

“Ah, well, well! doctors have seldom time to read news-
papers, and I dare say I’m not very correctin my story. I dare
say he’s innocent; I’m sure I had no right to say otherwise, —
only words slip out. — No! indeed, young woman, I see no
cause for apprehension about this poor creature in the next
room ;— weak — certainly; but a day or two's good nursing

will set her up, and I’m sure you're a good nurse, my dear,

was as well acquainted with the facts concerning the trial as she
was herself; for indeed she had never doubted that the doctor
would have been aware of the purpose of poor Mrs. Wilson's
journey to Liverpool.

Presently she went to Job (the ever ready Mrs. Davenport
keeping watch over the two old women), and told him her fears,
her plans, and her proceedings.

To her surprise he shook his head, doubtfully.

“Tt may have an awkard look, if we keep her back. Lawyers
is up to tricks.”

“But it is no trick,” said Mary. “She is so poorly, she was
last night so, at least; and to-day she 's so faded and weak.”

“Poor soul! I dare say. I only mean for Jem’s sake; and
so much is known, it won’t do now to hang back. But I'll ask
Mr. Bridgenorth. I'Ile’en take your doctor's advice. Yo tarry
at home, andI’ll come to yo in an hour's time. Go thy ways,
wench.”

CHAPTER XXV.
“Something there was, what, none presumed to say,
Clouds lightly passing on a smiling day, —
Whispers and hints which went from ear to ear,
And mixed reports no judge on earth could cleat

“Curious conjectures he may always make, '
And either side of dubious questions take.” In.

Mary went home. Oh! how her head did ache, and how
dizzy her brain was growing! But there would be time enough
she felt for giving way, hereafter.

So she sat quiet and still by an effort; sitting near the window,
and looking out of it, but seeing nothing, when all at once she
caught sight of something which roused her up, and made her
draw back.

But it was too late. She had been seen.

Sally Leadbitter flaunted into the little dingy room, making
it gaudy with the Sunday excess of colouring in her dress.

She was really curious to see Mary; her connexion with
murderer seemed to have made her into a sort of /usus nature,
and was almost, by some, expected to have made a change in her

personal appearance, so earnestly did they stare at her. But Mary *
had been too much absorbed the \aat dey or two to notice this.

 

Cranne.

 

a

She had been shocked, of course, at Mr. Carsons’ death,
though at the same time the excitement was rather pleasant than
otherwise; and dearly now would she have enjoyed the con-
spicuous notice which Mary was sure to receive.

“How shall you like being cross-examined, Mary?”

“Not at all,” answered Mary, when she found she must
answer.

“Lal! what impudent fellows those lawyers are! And their
clerks, too, nota bit better. I shouldn’t wonder” (in a comfort-
ing tone, and really believing she was giving comfort) “if you
picked up a new sweetheart in Liverpool. What gown are you
going in, Mary?”

“Oh, I don’t know and don’t care,” exclaimed Mary, sick
and weary of her visitor.

“Well, then! take my advice, and go in that blue merino.
It’s old to be sure, and a bit worn at elbows, but folk won't notice
that, and th’ colour suits you. Nowmind, Mary. And I'll lend
you my black watered scarf," added she, really good-naturedly,
according to her sense of things, and withal, a little bit pleased at
the idea of her pet article of dress figuring away on the person
of a witness at a trial for murder.

“Tl bring it to-morrow before you start.”

“No, don't!” said Mary; “thank you, but I don’t wantit.”

“Why, what can you wear? I know all your clothes as.well
asI do my own, and what is there you-can wear? Not your old
plaid shawl, Ido hope? You would not fancy this I have on,
more nor the scarf, would you?” said she, brightening up at the
thought, and willing to lend it, or any thing else.

“Oh, Sally! don’t go on talking a-that-ns;_ how can I think
on dress at such a time? When it’s a matter of life and death
to Jem?”

“Bless the girl! It’s Jem, isit? Well, now I thought there
was some sweetheart in the back ground, when you flew off so
with Mr. Carsons. Then what in the name of goodness made him
shoot Mr. Harry? After you had given up going with him, I
mean? Was he afraid you ’d be on again?”

“How dare you say he shot Mr. Harry?” asked Mary, firing

up from the state of languid indifference into which.she had sunk

folk could be led astray by one who was every way bad? How
e’er, that ’s not what I came to talk about. I’ve seen Mr. Bridge-
north, and he is in a manner of the same mind as we; he thinks it
would have an awkward look, and might tell against the poor lad
on his trial; still if'she ’s ill she’ sill, and it can’t be helped.”

“J don’t know if she ’s so bad as all that,” said Mary, who
began to dread her part in doing any thing which might tell
against her poor lover.

“Will you come and see her Job? the doctor seemed to say
as I liked, not as he thought.”

“That’s because he had no great thought on the subject,
either one way or t’ other,”’ replied Job, whose contempt for me-
dical men pretty nearly equalled his respect for lawyers. “But I’
go and welcome. I han not seen th’ ould ladies since their sorrows
and it’s but manners to go and ax after them. Come along.”

‘The room at Mrs. Wilson’s had that still, changeless look you
must have often observed in the house of sickness or mourning
No particular employment going on; people watching and wait-
ing rather than acting, unless in the more sudden and violent
attacks; what little movement is going on, so noiseless and
hushed; the furniture all arranged and stationary, with a view to
the comfort of the afflicted; the window-blinds drawn down, to
keep out the disturbing variety of a sun-beam; the same sad-
denedjserious look on the faces of the in-dwellers: you fall back
into the same train of thought with all these associations, and
forget the street, the outer world in the contemplation of the one
stationary , absorbing interest within.

Mrs. Wilson sat quietly in her chair, with just the same look
Mary had left on her face; Mrs.!Davenport went about with
creaking shoes which made all the more noise from her careful
and lengthened tread, annoying the ears of those who were well,
in this instance, far more than the dull senses of the sick and the
sorrowful. Alice’s voice still was going on cheerfully in the
upper room with incessant talking and little laughs to herself, or
perhaps in sympathy with her unseen companions; “unseen,”
I say, in preference to “fancied,” for who knows whether God
does not permit the forms of those who were dearest when living,
to hover round the bed of the dying?

 

 

304 —

I know many Scripture texts (though you would not think it),
that may keep up his heart. I missed seeing him ere he went to
yon prison, but nought shall keep me away again one minute
when I can see his face; for maybe the minutes are numbered, and
the count but small. IknowI can be a comfort to him, poor lad.
You would not think it now, but he'd always speak as kind and
soft to me as if he were courting me, like. He loved me above a
bit; and I am to leave him now to dree all the cruel slander
they 'll put upon him? I can pray for him at each hard word they
say against him, if I can do nought else; and he’ll know what his
mother is doing for him, poor lad, by the look on my face.”

Still they made some look, or gesture of opposition to her
wishes. She turned sharp round on Mary, the old object of her
pettish attacks, and said,

“Now wench! once for all, I tell you this. He could never
guide me; and he'd sense enough not to try. What he could na
do, don’t you try. I shall go to Liverpool to-morrow, and find my
lad, and stay with him through thick and thin; and if he dies, why,
perhaps, God of His mercy, will take me too. The grave is a sure
cure for an aching heart!”

She sank back in her chair, quite exhausted by the sudden
effort she had made; but if they even offered to speak, she cut
them short (whatever the subject might be), with the repetition of
the same words, “I shall go to Liverpool.”

No more could be said, the doctor’s opinion had been so un-
decided; Mr. Bridgenorth had given his legal voice in favour of
her going, and Mary was obliged to relinquish the idea of per
suading her to remain at home, if indeed under all the circum-
stances it could be thought desirable.

“Best way will be,” said Job, “for me to hunt out Will, early
to-morrow morning, and yo, Mary, come at after with Jane
Wilson. I know a decent woman where yo two can have a bed,
and where we may meet together when I ’ve found Will, afore
going to Mr. Bridgenorth's at two o’clock; for, I can tell him, I'L
not trust none of his clerks for hunting up Will, if Jem’s life’s to
depend on it.”

‘Now Mary disliked this plan inexpressibly; her dislike was
partly grounded on reason, and partly on feeling. She could not


306

them as will do for her what I cannot. Mrs. Davenport is a
willing body, and one who knows sorrow and sickness, and I can
pay her forher time, and keep her there pretty near altogether.
So let that be settled. And you take Mrs. Wilson, dear grandad,
and let Mary go find Will, and you can all meet together at after,
and I’m sure I wish you luck.”

Job consented with only a few dissenting grants; but on the
whole, with a very good grace for an old man who had been so
positive only a few minutes bofore.

Mary was thankful for Margaret’s interference. She did not
speak, but threw her arms round Margaret's neck, and put up her
rosy-red mouth to be kissed, and even Job was attracted by the
pretty, child-like gesture; and when she drew near him, after-
wards, like a little creature sidling up to some person whom it
feels to have offended, he bent down and blessed her, as if she
had been a child of bis own.

‘To Mary the old man’s blessing came like words of power.

CHAPTER XXVI.

“Like a bark upon the sea,
Life is floating over death;
Above, below, encircling thee’,
Danger lurks in every breath:

Parted art thou from the
Only by a plank most frail;
Tossed upon the restless wave,

Sport of every fickle gale.

Let the skies be e'er so clear,
And so calm and still the sea,
Shipwreck yet has he to fear.
‘ho life's voyager will be.” Ricmenr.

‘Tue early trains for Liverpool, on Monday morning, were
crowded by attorneys, attorneys’ clerks’, plaintiffs, defendants,
and witnesses, all going to the Assizes. ‘They were a motley as-
sembly, each with some cause for anxiety stirring at his heart;
though, after all, that is saying little or nothing, for we are all of
us in the same predicament through life; each with a fear ands
hope from childhood to death. Among the passengers thee was
Mary Barton,dressed in the blue gown and obnoxious plaid shawl.

Common as railroads are now in all places as a means of
transit, and especially in Manchester, Mary had never been on

   

 

   

 

  

 

308

“Yes, some such person. Of course she ‘ll be examined, and
Williams will do it in style. I shall slip out from our court to hear
him if I can hit the nick of time.”

“And ifyou can get a place you mean, for depend upon it the
court will be crowded.”

“Ay, ay, the ladies (sweet souls) will come in shoals to heara
trial for murder, and see the murderer, and watch the judge put
on his black cap.”

“And then go home, and groan over the Spanish ladies who
take delight in bull-fights — ‘such unfememinine creatures!’””

Then they went on to other subjects.

It was but another drop to Mary's cup; but she was nearly in
that state which Crabbe describes,

 

“For when so full the cup of sorrows flows 7

‘Add but a drop, it instantly o’erflows.””

And now they were in the tunnel! — and now they were in
Liverpool; and she must rouse herself from the torpor of mind
and body, which was creeping over her; the result of much
anxiety and fatigue, and several sleepless nights.

She asked a policeman the way to Milk House Yard, and
following his directions with the savoir faire of a town-bred girl,
she reached a little court leading out of a busy, thronged street,
not far from the Docks.

When she entered the quiet little yard she stopped to regain
her breath, and to gather strength, for her limbs trembled, and
her heart beat violently.

All the unfavourable contingencies she had, until now, for-
bidden herself to dwell upon, came forward to her mind — the
possibility, the bare possibility, of Jem being an accomplice in
the murder — the still greater possibility that he had not fulfilled
his intention of going part of the way with Will, but had been led
off by some little accidental occurrence from his original inten-
tion; and that he had spent the evening with those, whom it was
now too late to bring forward as witnesses.

But sooner or later she must know the truth; so taking
courage she knocked at the door of a house.

“Is this Mrs. Jones's?” she inquired.

 

310

 

amatter of life and death: he can save the innocent from being
hanged, — he cannot be gone, — how gone?”

“Sailed, my dear! sailed in the John Cropper this very
blessed morning.”

“Sailed!”

CHAPTER XXVII.
“Yon is your quay!
Hark to the clamour in that miry road,
Bounded and narrowed by yon vessel's load;
‘The lumbering wealth’she empties round the place,
Package and parcel, hogshead, cbest, and case:
While the loud seaman and the angry hind ,
‘Mingling in business, bellow to the wind.” Cranne.
Many staggered into the house. Mrs. Jones placed her
tenderly ima chair, and there stood bewildered by her side.
“Oh, father! father!” muttered she, ‘what have you done?
— What must I do? must the innocent die? — or he — whomI
fear —I fear —oh! what am I saying?” said she, looking round
affrighted, and seemingly reassured by Mrs. Jones’s countenance,
“Tam so helpless, so weak, — but a poor girl afterall. How
can I tell what is right? Father! you have always been so kind to
me, — and you to be — never mind — never mind, all will come
right in the grave.”
“Save us, and bless us!”’ exclaimed Mrs. Jones, “if I don’t
think she 's gone out of her wits!”
“No, I’m not!” said Mary, catching at the words, and with
a strong effort controlling the mind she felt to be wandering,
while the red blood flushed to scarlet the heretofore white cheek,
‘I'm not out of my senses; there is so much to be done — so
much —and no one but me to doit, you know, — though I can’t
rightly tell what it is,” looking up with bewilderment into Mrs.
Jones’s face. “I must not go mad whatever comes — at least not
yet. Nol” (bracing herself up), “something may yet be done, and
Imust do it. Sailed! did you say? The John Cropper? Sailed?”’
“‘Ay! she went out of dock last night, to be ready for the
morning’s tide.”
“I thought she was not to sail till to-morrow,” murmured
Mary.

 

312

at once in the case; “let's have a try for him. We are but where
we were if we fail.”

Mary roused herself. ‘The sympathetic “we” gave her heart
and hope. “But what can be done? You say he’s sailed; what
can be done?” But she spoke louder, and in a more life-like
tone.

“No! I did not say he’d sailed; mother said that, and wo-
men know nought about such matters. Yousee,” (proud of his
office of instructor, and insensibly influenced, as all about her
were, by Mary’s sweet, earnest, lovely countenance) “there ’s
sand-banks at the mouth of the river, and ships can’t get over
them but at high-water; especially ships of heavy burden, like
the John Cropper. Now, she was tugged down the river at low
water, or pretty near, and will have to lie some time before the
water will be high enough to float her over the banks. So hold
up your head, — you 'vea chance yet, though may be but poor
one.”

“But what must I do?” asked Mary, to whom all this ex-
planation had been a vague mystery.

“Do!” said the boy, impatiently, “why, have not I told
you? Only women (begging your pardon) are so stupid at
understanding about any thing relating to the sea; — you must
geta boat, and make all haste, and sail after him, — after the
John Cropper. You-may overtake her, or you may not. It’s
just a chance; but she’s heavy laden, and that’s in your favour.
She ’ll draw many feet of water.”

Mary had humbly and eagerly (oh, how eagerly!) listened
to this young Sir Oracle’s speech; but try as she would, she
could only understand that she must make haste, and sail —
somewhere —

“I beg your pardon,” (and her little acknowledgment of in-
feriority in this speech pleased the lad, and made him her still
more zealous friend.) “I beg your pardon,” said she, “but I
don’t know where to geta boat. Are there boat-stands?””

‘The lad laughed outright.

“You 're not long in Liverpool, I guess. Boat-stands! No;
go down to the pier, — any pier will do, and hire a boat, —
you 'll be at no loss when once you are there. Only make haste.”

 

314

“No, he’sncither kith nor kin to me. What's the matter?
‘What are you stopping for?” said she, with nervous terror, as
Charley turned back a few steps, and peered up aside street.

“Oh, nothing to flurry you so, Mary. I heard you say to
mother you had never been in Liverpool before, and if you'll
only look up this street you may see the back windows of our
Exchange. Such a building as yon is! with 'natomy hiding under
a blanket, and Lord Admiral Nelson, and a few more people in
the middle of the court! No! come here,” as Mary, in her
eagerness, was looking at any window that caught her eye first,
to satisfy the boy. ‘Here then, now you can see it. You can
say now, you've seen Liverpool Exchange.”

“Yes, to be sure — it’s a beautiful window, I’msure. But
are we near the boats? I'll stop as I come back, you know;
only I think we 'd better get on now.””

“Oh! if the wind’s in your favour you ’ll be down the river in
no time, and catch Will, I’ll be bound; and if it’s not, why,
you know, the minute it took you to look at the Exchange will be
neither here nor there.”

Another rush onwards, till one of the long crossings near the
docks caused a stoppage, and gave Mary time for breathing, and
Charley leisure to ask another question.

“You ’ve never said where you come from?”

“Manchester,” replied she.

“Eh, then! you ’ve a power of things to see. Liverpool
beats Manchester hollow, they say. A nasty, smoky hole, bean’t
it? Are you bound to live there?”

“Oh, yes! it’s my home.”

“Well, I don’t think I could abide a home in the middle of
smoke. Look there! now you see the river! That’s something
now you ’d give adeal for in Manchester. Look!’”

And Mary did look, and saw down an opening made in the
forest of masts belonging to the vessels in dock, the glorious
river, along which white-sailed ships were gliding with the

‘one who had nothing to do but look about him, and spit right
and left; addressing this old tar, Charley made known to him
his wish in slang, which to Mary was almost inaudible, and quite
unintelligible, and which I am too much of a land-lubber to
repeat correctly.

Mary watched looks and actions with a renovated keenness
of perception.

‘She saw the old man listen attentively to Charley; she saw
him eye her over from head to foot, and wind up his inspection
with a little nod of approbation (for her very shabbiness and
poverty of dress were creditable signs to the experienced old
sailor), and then she watched him leisurely swing himself on to
a ship in the basin, and borrowing a glass run up the mast with
the speed of a monkey.

“He'll fall!” said she, in affright, clutching at Charley’s
arm, and judging the sailor, from his storm-marked face and
unsteady walk on land, to be much older than he really was.

“Not he!” said Charley. “He's at the mast-head, now.
See! he 's looking through his glass, and using his arms as
steady as if he were on dry land. Why I've been up the mast,
many and many a time; only don’t tell mother. She thinks I’m to
bea shoemaker, but I’ve made up my mind to bea sailor; only
there's no good arguing witha woman. You'll not tell her, Mary?”

“Oh, see!” exclaimed she (his secret was very safe with her,
for, in fact, she had not heard it), “See! he’s coming down;
he’sdown. Speak to him, Charley.”

But unable to wait another instant she called out herself,

“Can you see the John Cropper? Is she there yet?”

“Ay, ay,” he answered, and coming quickly up to them,
he hurried them away to seek for a boat, saying the bar was
already covered, and in an hour the ship would hoist her sails,
and be off. “You ’ve the wind right against you, and must use
oars. No time to lose.”

‘They ran to some steps leading down to the water. They
beckoned to some watermen, who, suspecting the real state of
the case, appeared in no hurry for a fare, but leisurely brought
their boat alongside the stairs, as if it were a matter of in-
“ference to them whether they were engaged or not, while

CHAPTER XXVIII.

“A wel sheet and a flowing sea,

A wind that follow.

And fills the white and rustling sail,
‘And bends the gallant mast!

‘And bends the gallant mast, my boys,
While, like the eagle free,

Away the good ship flies, "tnd leaves
Old England on the lee.” ALLAN ConNINGHAM.

Mary had not understood that Charley was not coming with
her. In fact,-she had not thought about it, till she perceived
his absence, as they pushed off from the landing-place, and
remembered that she had never thanked him for all his kind
interest in her behalf, and now his absence made her feel most
lonely — even his, the little mushroom friend of an hour's
growth.

The boat threaded her way through the maze of
vessels which surrounded the shore, bumping against one, kept
off by the oars from going right against another, overshadowed
by a third, until at length they were fairly out on the broad
river, away from either shore; the sights, and sounds of land
being lost in the distance.

And then came a sort of pause.

Both wind and tide were against the two men, and labour
as they would they made but little way. Once Mary in her im-
patience had risen up to obtain a better view of the progress they
had made, but the men had roughly told her to sit down imme-
diately, and she had dropped on her seat like a chidden child,
although the impatience was still at her heart.

But now she grew sure they were turning off from the straight
course which they had hitherto kept on the Cheshire side of the
river, whither they had gone to avoid the force of the current,
and after a short time she could not help naming her conviction,
as a kind of nightmare dread and belief came over her, that
every thing animate and inanimate was in league against her one
sole aim and object of overtaking Will.

‘They answered grufily. They saw 2 boatman whom they
knew, and were desirous of obtaining his services as steersman,
so that both might row with greater effect. They knew what

 


320

 

Full of the spirit of the chase, though as yet ignorant of
Mary’s motives, the men sprung to hoist another sail. It was
fully as much as the boat could bear, in the keen, gusty east
wind which was now blowing, and she bent and laboured, and
ploughed, and creaked upbraidingly as if tasked beyond her
strength; but she sped along with a gallant swiftness.

‘They drew nearer, and they heard the distant “‘aboy’? more
clearly. It ceased. ‘The anchor was up, and the ship was
away.

Mary stood up, steadying herself by the mast, and stretched
out her arms, imploring the flying vessel to stay its course, by
that mute action, wl the tears streamed down her cheeks.
The men caught up their oars, and hoisted them in the air, and
shouted to arrest attention.

‘They were seen by the men aboard,the larger craft; but they
were too busy with all the confusion prevalent in an outward-
bound vessel to pay much attention. There were coils of ropes
and seamen’s chests to be stumbled over at every turn; there
were animals, not properly secured, roaming bewildered about
the deck, adding their pitiful lowings and bleatings to the aggre-
gate of noises. There were carcases not cut up, looking like
corpses of sheep and pigs rather than like mutton and pork;
there were sailors running here and there and everywhere,
having had no time to fall into method, and with their minds
divided between thoughts of the land and the people they had
left, and the present duties on board ship; while the captain
strove hard to procure some kind of order by hasty commands
given in aloud, impatient voice, to right and left, starboard,
and larboard, cabin and steerage.

As he paced the deck with a chafed step, vexed at one or
two little mistakes on the part of the mate, and suffering himself
from the pain of separation from wife and children, but showing
his suffering only by his outward irritation, he heard a hail from
the shabby little river boat that was striving to overtake his
winged ship. For the men fearing that, as the ship was now
fairly over the bar, they should only increase the distance be-
tween them, and being now within shouting range, had asked
~f Mary her more particular desire.

  

 

322

 

She had heard with her ears, but her brain refused to re-
cognise the sense.

‘They repeated his speech, all three speaking at once, with
many comments; while Mary looked at them and then at the
vessel far away.

“J don’t rightly know about it,” said she, sorrowfully.
“What is the pilot-boat?””

They told her, and she gathered the meaning out of the
sailors’ slang which enveloped it. There was a hope still,
although so slight and faint.

“How far does the pilot go with the ship?”

‘Lo different distances they said. Some pilots would go as
far as Holyhead for the chance of the homeward-bound vessels;
others only took the ships over the Banks. Some captains were
more cautious than others, and the pilots had different ways.
‘The wind was against the homeward-bound vessels, so perhaps
the pitot aboard the John Cropper would not care to go far out.

“How soon would he come back?”

There were three boatmen, and three opinions, varying
from twelve hours to two days. Nay, the man who gave his
vote for the longest time, on having his judgment disputed,
grew stubborn, and doubled the time, and thought it might be
the end of the week before the pilot-boat came home.

They began disputing, and urging reasons; and Mary tried
to understand them; but independently of their nautical lan-
guage, a veil seemed drawn over her mind, and she had no
clear perception of any thing that passed. Her very words
seemed not her own, and beyond her power of control, for she
found herself speaking quite differently to what she meant.

‘One by one her hopes had fallen away, and left her desolate;
and though a chance yet remained, she could no longer hope.
She felt certain it, too, would fade and vanish. She sank into
a kind of stupor. All outward objects harmonised with her
despair, — the gloomy leaden sky, — the deep, dark waters
below, ofa still heavier shade of colour, — the cold, flat, yellow
shore in the distance, which no ray lightened up, — the nipping
cutting wind.

She shivered with her depression of mind and body.

 

324

 

“Where are you bound to? I axed that question afore,” said
the gruff old fellow.

“Tdon’tknow. I’mastranger,” replied she, quietly, with
a strange absence of anxiety under the circumstances.

“But you mun find out, then,” said he, sharply, “pier-
head's no place for a young woman to be standing on, gape-
saying.”

“T’ve a card somewhere as will tell me,” she answered,
and the man partly relieved, jumped into the boat, which was
now pushing off to make way for the arrivals from some steamer.

Mary felt in her pocket for the card, on which was written the
name of the street where she was to have met Mr. Bridgenorth at
two o’clock; where Job and Mrs. Wilson were to have been,
and where she was to have learnt from the former the par-
ticulars fof some respectable lodging. It was not tobe found.

She tried to brighten her perceptions, and felt again, and
took out the little articles her pocket contained, her empty
purse, her pocket-handkerchief, and such little things, but it
was not there.

In fact she had dropped it when, so eager to embark, she had
pulled out her purse to reckon up her money.

She did not know this, of course. She only knew it. was

ne.

It added but little to the despair that was creeping over her.
But she tried a little more to help herself, though every minute

+ her mind became more cloudy. She strove to remember where
Will had lodged, but she could not; name, street, every thing
had passed away, and it did not signify; better she were lost
than found.

She sat down quietly on the top step of the landing, and
gazed down into the dark, dank water below. Once or twicea’
spectral thought loomed among the shadows of her brain; a
wonder whether beneath that cold dismal surface there would not
be rest from the troubles of earth. But she could not hold an
idea before her for two consecutive moments; and she forgot
what she thought about before she could act upon it.

So she continued sitting motionless, without looking up,
or regarding in any way the insults to which she was subjected.

ance; he was more curious to know the result of Mr. Bridge-
north’s interview that morning with Jem.

“Why, yes,” said Mr. Bridgenorth, putting down his pen,
“have seen him, but to little purpose, I’m afraid. He's very
impracticable — very. Itoldhim, of course, that he must be
perfectly open with me, or else I could not be prepared for the
weak points. Inamed your name with the view of unlocking his
confidence, but —”

“What did he say?” asked Job, breathlessly.

“Why, very little. He barely answered me. Indeed, he
refused to answer some questions — positively refused. I don’t
know what I can do for him.””

“Then you think him guilty, Sir,” said Job, despondingly.

“No, I don’t,” replied Mr. Bridgenorth, quickly and decisive-
ly, “Much less than Idid before I saw him. The impression (mind,
"tis only impression; I rely upon your caution, not to take it for
fact) — the impression,” with an emphasis on the word, “he
gave meis, that he knows something about the affair, but what,
he will not say; and so, the chances are, if he persists in his obsti-
nacy, he’llbe hung. That's all.”

‘He began to write again, for he had no time to lose.

“But he must not be hung,” said Job, with vehemence.

Mr. Bridgenorth looked up, smiled a little, but shook his
head.

“What did he say, Sir, if I may be so bold as to ask?” con-
tinued Job.

“His words were few enough, and he was so reserved and
short, that as I said before, I can only give you the impression
they conveyed to me. I toldhim, of course, who I was, and
for what I was sent. He looked pleased, I thought, — at least
his face (sad enough when I went in, I assure ye) brightened a
little; but he said he had nothing to say, no defence to make.
Jasked him if he was guilty, then; and by way of opening his
heart I said I understood he had had provocation enough, inas-
much as J heard that the girl was very lovely, and had jilted him
to fall desperately in love with that handsome young Carsons
(poor fellow!). But James Wilson did not speak one way or
another. Ithen went to particulars. Lasked him if the gun was

 


328

There was a true bill against James Wilson. Ofcourse. And
yet Job felt now doubly anxious and sad. It seemed the begin-
ning of the end. He bad got, by imperceptible degrees, to think
Jem innocent. Little by little this persuasion had come upon him.

Mary (tossing about in the little boat on the broad river) did
not come, nor did Will.

Job grew very restless. He longed to go and watch for them
out ofthe window, but feared to interrupt Mr. Bridgenorth. At
length his desire to look out was irresistible, and he got up and
walked carefully and gently across the room, his boots creaking
at every cautious step. The gloom which had overspread the
sky, and the influence of which had been felt by Mary on the
open water, was yet more perceptible in the dark, dull street.
Job grew more and more fidgety. He was obliged to walk about
the room, for he could not keep still; and he did so, regardless
of Mr. Bridgenorth’s impatient little motions and noises, asthe
slow, stealthy, creaking movements were heard, backwards and
forwards, behind his chair.

He really liked Job, and was interested for Jem, else his
nervousness would have overcome his sympathy long before it
did. But he could hold out no longer against the monotonous,
grating sound; so at last he threw down his pen, locked his
portfolio, and taking up his hat and gloves, told Job he must go
to the courts.

“But Will Wilson is not come,” said Job, in dismay. “Just
wait while I run to hislodgings. I would have done it before, but
I thought they’d be here every minute, and I were afraid of miss-
ing them. 1’ll be back in no time.”

“No, my good fellow, Ireally must go. Besides, I begin to
think Johnson must have made a mistake, and have fixed with
this William Wilson to meet me at the courts. If you like to
wait for him here, pray make use of my room; but I ‘ve a notion
I shall find him there: in which case, I’ll send him to your lod-
gings; shall I? You know where to find me. Ishall be here
again by eight o’clock, and with the evidence of this witness
that’s to prove the alibi, I'll have the brief drawn out, and in
the hands of counsel to-night.””

So saying, he shook hands with Job, and went his way. The

“Thou shalt do no such a thing,” said his mother, setting
her back against the door. The lad made a comical face at Job,
which met with no responsive look from the old man, whose
sympathies were naturally in favour of the parent; although he
would thankfully have availed himself of Charley's offer; for
he was weary, and anxious to return to poor Mrs. Wilson, who
would be wondering what had become of him.

“How can I best find her? Who did she go with, lad?”

But Charley was sullen at his mother’s exercise of authority
before a stranger, and at that stranger's grave looks when he
meant to have made him laugh.

“They were river boatmen; — that’s all I know,”’ said he.

7 “But what was the name of their boat?” persevered Job.

“Tnever took no notice — the Anne, or William, — or some
of them common names, I’Il be bound.”

«What pier did she start from?” asked Job, despairingly.

“Oh, as for that matter, it were the stairs on the Prince’s
Pier she started from; but she ’ll not come back to the same, for -
the American steamer came up with the tide, and anchored close
to it, blocking up the way for all the smaller craft. It’s arough
evening too, to be out on,” he maliciously added.

“Well, God’s will be done! I did hope we could have saved
the lad,” said Job, sorrowfally; “but I'm gettin very doubtful
again. I’m uneasy about Mary, too,—very. She’s astranger
in Liverpool.”

“Se she told me,” said Charley. There’s traps about for
young women at every corner. It’s a pity she’s no one to meet
her when she lands.”

“As for that,” replied Job, “I don’t see how any one could
meet her when we can’t tell where she} would come to. I must
trust to her coming right. She’s getten spiritand sense. She'll
most likely be for coming here again. Indeed, I don’t know
what else she can do, for she knows no other place in Liverpool.
Missus, if she comes, will you give your son leave to bring her
to No. 8, Back Garden Court, where there’s friends waiting
for her? Ill give him sixpence for his trouble.”

Mrs. Jones, pleased with the reference to her, gladly pro-
mised. And even Charley, indignant as he was at first at the

but get speech onhim. She’s not back yet. Come, come, hold
up thy head. It will all end right.”

“Tt will all end right,” echoed she; “but not as thou tak’st
it. Jem will be hung, and will go to his father and the little
lads; where the Lord God wipes away all tears, and where the
Lord Jesus speaks kindly to the little ones, who look about for
the mothers they left upon earth. Eh, Job, yon’s a blessed
land, and I long to go to it, and yet I fret because Jem is
hastening there. I would not fret if he and I could lie down to-
night to sleep our last sleep; nota bit would I fret if folk would
but know him to be innocent — as I do.”

“They ‘ll know it sooner or later, and repent sore if they ’ve
hanged him for what he never did,” replied Job.

“Ay, that they will. Poor souls! May God have mercy on
them when they find out their mistake.”

Presently Job grew tired of sittng waiting, and gotup, and
hung about the door and window, like some animal wanting to go
out. It was pitch dark, for the moon had not yet risen.

“You just go to bed,” said he, to the widow, “You'll want
your strength for to-morrow. Jem will be sadly off, if he sees
you so cut up as you look to-night. I'll step down again and
find Mary. Shell be back by this time. I'll come and tell you
every thing, never fear. But, now, you goto bed.”

“Thou ’rt a kind friend, Job Legh, and I'll go, as thou
wishestme. But, oh! mind thou com’st straight off tome, and
bring Mary as soon as thou’st lit on her.” She spoke low, but
very calmly.

«Ay, ay!” replied Job, slipping out of the house.

He went first to Mr. Bridgenorth’s, where it had struck him
that Will and Mary might be all this time waiting for him.

‘They were not there, however. Mr. Bridgenorth had just .
come in, and Job went breathlessly up-stairs to consult with him
as to the state of the case.

“It’s.a bad job,” said the lawyer, looking very grave, while
he arranged his papers. “Johnson told me how it was; the
woman that Wilson lodged with told him. I doubt it’s buta
wild goose-chase of the girl Barton. Our case must rest on the
uncertainty of circumstantial evidence, and the goodness of the

 

334

given him, he went out into the street; and there he stood still,
to ponder over probabilities and chances.

After some little time he slowly turned towards the lodging
where he had left Mrs. Wilson. There was nothing else to be
done; but he loitered on the way, fervently hoping that her
weariness and her woes might have sent her to sleep before his
return, that he might be spared her questionings.

He went very gently into the house-place where the sleepy
landlady awaited his coming, and his bringing the girl, who, she
had been told, was to share the old woman’s bed.

But in her sleepy blindness she knocked things so about in
lighting the candle (she could see to have a nap by fire-light, she
said), that the voice of Mrs. Wilson was heard from the little
back-room, where she was to pass the night.

“Who 's there?” .

Job gave no answer, and kept down his breath, that she
might think herself mistaken. The landlady, having no such
care, dropped the snuffers with a sharp metallic sound, and
then, by her endless apologies, convinced the listening woman
that Job had returned.

“Job! Job Legh!” she cried out, nervously.

“Eb, dear!” said Job, to himself, going reluctantly to her
bed-room door. “I wonder if one little lie would be a sin as.
things stand. It would happen give her sleep, and she won't
have sleep for many and a many a night (not to call sleep), if
things goes wrong to-morrow. I'll chance it, any way.”

“Job! art thou there?” asked she again, with a trembling
impatience that told in every tone of her voice.

“Ay! sure! I thought thou ’d ha’ been asleep by this time.”

“Asleep! How could I sleep till I knowed if Will were
found?”

“Now for it,” muttered Job, to himself. Then ina louder
voice, “Never fear! he ’s found, and safe, ready for to-morrow.”

“And he 'll prove that thing for my poor lad, willhe? He'll
bear witness that Jem were with him? Oh, Job, speak! tell
me all!”

“In for a penny, in fora pound,’ thought Job. “Happen
one prayer will do for the sum total. Any rate, I must go on

CHAPTER XXXI.
“To think
That all this long interminable night,
‘Which I have passed in thinking on two words —
“Guilty? — ‘Not Guilty!’ — like one bappy moment
O’er many a head hath flown unheeded by;
Over happy sleepers dreaming in their bliss
‘Of bright to-morrows — or far happier still,
With deep breath buried in forgetfulness.
O all the dismallest images of death
Did swim before my eyes!” Witsen.

Anp now, where was Mary?

How Job’s heart would have been relieved of one of its cares
if he could have seen her: for he was in a miserable state of
anxiety about her; and many and many a time through that long
night, he scolded her and himself; her for her obstinacy, and
himself for his weakness in yielding to her obstinacy, when she
insisted on being the one to follow and find out Will.

She did not pass that night in bed, any more than Job; but
she was under a respectable roof, and among kind, though rough

ple.

She had offered no resistance to the old boatman, when he
had clutched her arm, in order to insure her following him, as
he threaded the crowded dock-ways, and dived up strange by-
streets. She came on meekly after him, scarcely thinking in her
stupor where she was going, and glad (in a dead, heavy way)
that some one was deciding things for her.

He led her to an old-fashioned house, almost as small as
house could be, which had been built long ago, before all the
other part of the street, and had a country-town look about it in
the middle of that bustling back street. He pulled her into the
house-place; and relieved to a certain degree of his fear of losing
her on the way, he exclaimed,

“There!” giving a great slap of one hand on her back.

‘The room was light and bright, and roused Mary (perhaps
the slap on her back might help 4 little, too), and she felt
awkwardness of accounting for her presence to a little bustling
old woman who had been moving about the fire-place on her
entrance. The boatman took it very quietly, never deigning to
give any explanation, but sitting down in his own particular

feathers is always good for a faint. But they don’t bring her
round, poor wench! Now what's he after next? Well! heisa
bright one, my old man! That I never thought of that, to be
sure!” exclaimed she, as he produced a square bottle of smug-
gled spirits, labelled “Golden Wasser,” from a corner cupboard
in their little room.

“That 'll do!” said she, as the dose he poured into Mary’s
open mouth, made her start and cough. “Bless the man! It’s
just like him to be so tender and thoughtful!”

“Not a bit!” snarled he, as he was relieved by Mary’s re-
turning colour, and opened eyes, and wondering, sensible gaze,
“Nota bit! Inever was such a fool afore.””

His wife helped Mary to rise, and placed her in a chair.

“All’s right, now, young woman?” asked the boatman,
anxiously.

“Yes, Sir, and thank you. I’m sure, Sir, I don’t know
rightly how to thank you,” faltered Mary, softly forth.

“Be hanged to you and your thanks.” And he shook himself,
took his pipe, and went out without deigning another word;
leaving his wife, sorely puzzled as to the character and history
of the stranger within her doors.

Mary watched the boatman leave the house, and then, turning
her sorrowful eyes to the face of her hostess, she attempted
feebly to rise, with the intention of going away, — where she
knew not.

“Nay! nay! whoe’er thou be’st, thou rt not fit to go out into
the street. Perhaps” (sinking her voice alittle) “thou ’rt a bad
one; I almost misdoubt thee, thou ’rt so pretty. Well-a-well! it’s
the bad ones as have the broken hearts, sure enough; good folk
never get utterly cast down, they ’ve always getten hope in the
Lord; it’s the sinful as bear the bitter, bitter grief in their
crushed hearts, poor souls; it’s them we ought, most of all, to
pity and to help. She shanna leave the house to-night, choose
who she is, — worst woman in Liverpool, she shanna. I wishedI
knew where th’ old man picked her up, that I do.”

Mary had listened feebly to this soliloquy, and now tried to
satisfy her hostess, in weak, broken sentences.

“I’m not a bad one, missis, indeed. Your master took me out

instantly recognised the unfavourable point at which the in-
dicator seemed stationary, and giving a heavy sigh, turned into
the room, and began to beat about if her own mind for some
other mode of comfort.

“There ’s no one else who can prove what you want at the
trial to-morrow, is there?” asked she.

“No one!” answered Mary.

“And you ’ve no clue to the one as is really guilty, if t’other
is not?”

Mary did not answer, but trembled all over.

Sturgis saw it.

“Don’t bother her with thy questions,” said he, to his wife.
“She mun go to bed, for she's all in a shiver with the sea air.
I'll see after the wind, hang it, and the weather-cock, too. Tide
will help ’em when it turns.”

Mary went up-stairs murmuring thanks and blessings on those
who took the stranger in. Mrs. Sturgis. led her into a little room
redolent of the sea, and foreign lands. There was a small bed
for one son, bound for China; and a hammock slung above for
another, who was now tossing in the Baltic. The sheets looked
made out of sail-cloth, but were fresh and clean in spite of their
brownness.

Against the wall were wafered two rough drawings of vessels
with their names written underneath, on which the mother’s eyes
caught, and gazed until they filled with tears. But she brushed
the drops away with the back of her hand; and ina cheerful tone,
went on to assure Mary the bed was well aired.

“T cannot sleep, thank you. I will sit here, if you please,”
said Mary, sinking down on the window-seat.

“Come, now,” said Mrs. Sturgis, “my master told me to see
you to bed, andI mun. Whats the use of watching? A watched
pot never boils, and see you are after watching that weather-
cock. Why now, [try never to look at it, else I could do nought
else. My heart many a time goes sick when the wind rises, but I
turn away and work away, and try never to think on the wind, but
on what I ha’ getten to do.”

“Let me stay up a little,” pleaded Mary, as her hostess seemed
so resolute about seeing her to bed. Her looks won her suit.

 

down his bedroom with the restless incessant tramp of a wild
beast ina cage, and if he compelled his aching limbs to cease for
an instant, the twitchings which ensued almost amounted to con-
vulsions, and he re-commenced his walk as the lesser evil, and
the more bearable fatigue.

With daylight, increased power of action came; and he drove
off to arouse his attorney, and worry him with further directions
and inquiries; and when that was ended, he sat, watch in hand,
until the courts should be opened, and the trial begin.

What were all the living, — wife or daughters, — what were
they in comparison with the dead, —the murdered son who lay
unburied still, in compliance with his father’s earnest wish, and
almost vowed purpose of having the slayer of his child sentenced
to death, before he committed the body to the rest of the grave?

At nine o’clock they all met at their awful place of rendezvous.

The judge, the jury, the avenger of blood, the prisoner, the
witnesses — all were gathered together within one building. And
besides these were many others, personally interested in some
part of the proceedings, in which, however, they took no part;
Job Legh, Ben Sturgis, and several others were there, amongst
whom was Charley Jones.

‘Job Legh had carefully avoided any questioning from Mrs.
Wilson that morning. Indeed he had not been much in her com-
pany, for he had risen up early to go out once more to make in-
quiry for Mary; and when he could hear nothing of her, he had
desperately resolved not to undeceive Mrs. Wilson, as sorrow

* never came too late; and if the blow were inevitable, it would
be better to leave her in ignorance of the impending evil as long
as possible. She took her place in the witness-room, worn and
dispirited, but not anxious.

‘As Job struggled through the crowd into thé body of the
court, Mr. Bridgenorth’s clerk beckoned to him.

“Here ’s a letter for you from our client!”

Job sickened as he took it. He did not know why, but he
dreaded a confession of guilt, which would be an overthrow of
all hope.

The letter ran as follows:

 

344

Job turned the letter over and over when he had read it;
sighed deeply; and then wrapping it carefully up in a bit of news-
paper he had about him, he put it in his waistcoat pocket, and
‘went off to the door of the witness-room to ask if Mary Barton
was there.

‘As the door opened he saw her sitting within, against a table
on which her folded arms were resting, and her head was hidden
within them. It was an attitude of hopelessness, and would have
served to strike Job dumb in sickness of heart, even without
the sound of Mrs. Wilson’s voice in passionate sobbing, and sore
lamentations, which told him as well as words could do (for she
was not within view of the door, and he did not care to go in),
that she was at any rate partially undeceived as to the hopes he
had given her last night.

Sorrowfully did Job return into the body of the court;
neither Mrs. Wilson nor Mary having seen him as he had stood at
the witness-room door.

As soon as he could bring his distracted thoughts to bear upon
the present scene, he perceived that the trial of James Wilson for
the murder of Henry Carsons was just commencing. The clerk
was gabbling over the indictment, and in a minute or two there
was the accustomed question, “How say you, Guilty, or Not
Guilty?”

Although but one answer was expected, — was customary in
all cases, — there was a pause of dead silence, an interval of so-
lemnity even in this hackneyed part of the proceeding; while the
prisoner at the bar stood with compressed lips, looking at the
judge with his outward eyes, but with far other and different
scenes presented to his mental vision; a sort of rapid recapitu-
Jation of his life, — remembrances of his childhood, — his father
(so proud of him, his first-born child), — his sweet little play-
fellow, Mary, — his hopes, his love, — his despair, yet still, yet
ever and ever, his love, —the blank, wide world it had been with-
out her love, — his mother, — his childless mother, — but not
long to be so, — not long to be away from all she loved, — nor
during that time to be oppressed with doubt as to his innocence,
sure and secure of her darling’s heart; — he started from his in-
stant’s pause, and said in a low firm voice,

“Clear as day against the prisoner,” whispered one attorney's
clerk to another.

“Black as night, you mean,”
both smiled.

“Jane Wilson! who’s she? some relation, I suppose, from
the name.”

“The mother,—she that is to prove the gun-part of the case.””

“Oh, ay —Iremember! Rather hard on her, too, I think.”

Then both were silent, as one of the officers of the court
ushered Mrs. Wilson into the witness-box. I have often called
her “the old woman,” and “an old woman,” because, in truth,
her appearance was so much beyond her years, which could not
be many above fifty. But partly owing to her accident in early
life, which left a stamp of pain upon her face, partly owing to her
anxious temper, partly to her sorrows, and partly to her limping
gait, she always gave me the idea of age. Butnow she might
have seemed more than seventy; her lines were so set and deep,
her features so sharpened, and her walk so feeble. She was
trying to check her sobs into composure, and (unconsciously) was
striving to behave as she thought would best please her poor boy,
whom she knew she had often grieved by her uncontrolled impa-
tience. He had buried his face in his arms, which rested on the
front of the dock (an attitude he retained during the greater part
of his trial, and which prejudiced many against him).

‘The counsel began the examination.

“Your name is Jane Wilson, I believe?”

“Yes, Sir.”

«The mother of the prisoner at the bar?”

“Yes, Sir,” with quivering voice, ready to break out into
weeping, but earning respect by the strong effort at self-control,
prompted, as I have said before, by her earnest wish to please her
son by her behaviour.

The barrister now proceeded to the important part of the ex-
amination, tending to prove that the gun found on the scene of
the murder was the prisoner’s. She had committed herself so
fully to the policeman, that she could not well retract; so without
much delay in bringing the question round to the desired point,
the gun was produced in court, and the inquiry made— .

replied his friend; and they

 

348

and very poor, having nought left to love on earth, and I
cannot say ‘His will be done.’ I cannot, my lord judge, oh,
Tcannot.”” :

While sobbing out these words she was led away by the
officers of the court, but tenderly, and reverently, with the
respect which great sorrow commands.

‘The stream of evidence went on and on, gathering fresh
force from every witness who was examined, and threatening to
overwhelm poor Jem. Already they had proved that the gun
was his, that he had been heard not many days before the com-
mission of the deed to threaten the deceased; indeed, that the
police had, at that time, been obliged to interfere, to prevent
some probable act of violence. It only remained to bring for-
ward a sufficient motive for the threat and the murder. The
clue to this had been furnished by the policeman, who had over-
heard Jem’s angry language to Mr. Carsons; and his report in
the first instance had occasioned the subpana to Mary.

And now she was to be called on to bear witness. The court
was by this time almost as full as it could hold; but fresh at-
tempts were being made to squeeze in at all the entrances, for
many were anxious to see and hear this part of the trial.

Old Mr. Carsons felt an additional beat at his heart at the
thought of seeing the fatal Helen, the cause of all—a kind of
interest and yet repugnance, for was not she beloved by the
dead; nay, perhaps in her way, loving and mourning for the
same being that he himself was so bitterly grieving over? And
yet he felt as if he abhorred her and her rumoured loveliness,
as if she were the curse against him; and he grew jealous of the
love with which she had inspired his son, and would fain have
deprived her of even her natural right of sorrowing over her
Jover’s untimely end: for you see it was a fixed idea in the minds
of all, that the handsome, bright, gay, rich, young gentleman
must have been beloved in preference to the serious, almost
stern-looking smith, who had to toil for his daily bread.

Hitherto the effect of the trial had equalled Mr. Carsons’
most sanguine hopes, and a severe look of satisfaction came over
the face of the avenger, — over that countenance whence the
smile had departed, never more to return.

if in adream. So she went on for two or three more questions,
with a strange wonder in her brain, as the reality of the terrible
circumstances in which she was placed.

Suddenly she was roused, she knew not how or by what.
‘She was conscious that all was real, that hundreds were looking
at her, that true-sounding words were being extracted from her;
that that figure, so bowed down, with the face concealed with
both hands, was really Jem. Ler face flashed scarlet, and
then, paler than before. But in dread of herself, with the
tremendous secret imprisoned within her, she exerted every
power she had to keep in the full understanding of what was
going on, of what she was asked, and of what she answered.
With all her faculties preternaturally alive and sensitive, she
heard the next question from the pert young barrister, who was
delighted to have the examination of this witness.

““And pray, may Lask, which was the favoured lover? You
say you knew both these young men. Which was the favoured
lover? Which did you prefer

And who was he, the questioner, that he should dare 80
lightly to ask of her heart’s secrets? That he should dare to
ask her to tell, before that multitude assembled there, what
woman usually whispers with blushes and tears, and many hesita-
tions, to one ear alone?

So, for an instant, a look of indignation contracted Mary's
brow, as she steadily met the eyes of the impertinent counsellor.
But, in that instant, she saw the hands removed from a face
beyond, behind; and # countenance revealed of such intense
love and woe, —such a deprecating dread of her answer; and
suddenly her resolution was taken. The present was every
thing; the future, that vast shroud, it was maddening to think
upon; but now she might own her fault, but now she might even
own her love. Now, when the beloved stood thus, abhorred
of men, there would be no feminine shame to stand between her
and her avowal. So she also turned towards the judge, partly
to mark that her answer was not given to the monkeyfied man
who questioned her, and likewise that her face might be averted
from, and her eyes not gaze upon, the form that contracted with
the dread of the words he anticipated.


352

“No, Sir. Idon’t think as I've done wrong in saying, now
as things stand, what my feelings are; but I never would be so
bold as to tell one young man I cared for another. I never named.
Jem’s name to Mr. Carsons. Never.” -

“Then what did you say when you bad this final conversation
with Mr. Carsons? You can give me the substance of it, if you
don’t remember the words.”

“I'll try, Sir; but I’m not very clear. I told him I could
not love him, and wished to have nothing more to do with him.
He did his best to over-persuade me, but I kept steady, and at
last I ran off.””

“And you never spoke to him again?”

“Never!”

“Now, young woman, remember you are upon your oath.
Did you ever tell the prisoner at the bar of Mr. Henry Carsons’
attentions to you? of your acquaintance, in short? Did you
ever try to excite his jealousy by boasting of a lover so far above
you in station?”

“Never. I never did,” said she, in so firm and distinct a
manner as to leave no doubt.

“Were you aware that he knew of Mr. Henry Carsons’ regard
for you? Remember you are on your oath!”

“Never; Sir. Iwas not aware untibI heard of the quarrel
between them, and what Jem had said to the policeman, and
that was after the murder. To this day I can’t make out who
toldJem. Oh, Sir, may not go down?”

For she felt the sense, the composure, the very bodily
strength which she had compelled to her aid for a time, sud-
denly giving way, and was conscious that she was losing all com-
mand over herself, There was no occasion to detain her longer;
she had done her part. She might godown. The evidence was
still stronger against. the prisoner; but now he stood erect and
firm, with self-respect in his attitude, and a look of determination
on his face, which almost made it appear noble. Yet he seemed
lost in thought.

Job Legh had all this time been trying to soothe and comfort
Mrs. Wilson, who would first be in the court, in order to see her
darling, and then, when her sobs became irrepressible, had to

 

354

The counsel for the prisoner had avoided much cross-exami-
nation, reserving to himself the right of calling the witnesses
forward again; for he had received so little, and such vague
instructions, and understood that so much depended on the
evidence of one who was not forthcoming, that in fact he had
little hope of establishing any thing like a show of a defence, and
contented himself with watching the case, and lying in wait for
any legal objections that might offer themselves. He lay back on
the seat, occasionally taking # pinch of snuff, in a manner in-
tended to be contemptuous; now and then elevating his eye-
brows, and sometimes exchanging alittle note with Mr. Bridge-
north behind him. The attorney had far more interest in the case
than the barrister, to which he was perhaps excited by his poor
old friend Job Legh; who had edged and wedged himself through
the crowd close to Mr. Bridgenorth’s elbow, sent thither by Ben
Sturgis, to whom he had been “introduced” by Charley Jones,
and who had accounted for Mary’s disappearance on the pre-
ceding day, and spoken of their chase, their fears, their hopes.

All this was told in a few words to Mr. Bridgenorth — so few,
that they gave him but a confused idea, that time was of value;
and this he named to his counsel, who now rose to speak for the
defence.

Job Legh looked about for Mary, now he had gained, and
given, some idea of the position of things. At last he saw her,
standing by a decent-looking woman, looking flushed and
anxious, and moving her lips incessantly, as if eagerly talking;
her eyes never resting on any object, but wandering about as if
in search of something. Job thought it was for him she was
seeking, and he struggled to get round to her. When he bad
succeeded, she took no notice of him, although he spoke to her,
but still kept looking round and round in the same wild, restless
manner. He tried to hear the low quick mutterings of her voice;
he caught the repetition of the same words over and over again.

“J must not go mad. I must not, indeed. They say people
tell the truth when they ’re mad; but I don’t. I was always a liar.
Iwas, indeed; butI’m not mad. I must not go mad. I must
not, indeed.”

Suddenly she seemed to become aware how earnestly Job was


356

80 much out of earnestness to save the prisoner, of whose inno-
cence he was still doubtful, as because he saw the opportunities
for the display of forensic eloquence which were presented by the
facts; “a gallant tar brought back from the pathless ocean by a
girl’s noble daring,” “the dangers of too hastily judging from
circumstantial evidence,” &c., &c.; while the counsellor for the
prosecution prepared himself by folding his arms, elevating his
eyebrows, and putting his lips in the form in which they might
best whistle down the wind such evidence as might be produced
by a suborned witness, who dared to perjure himself. For, of
course, it is etiquette to suppose that such evidence as may be
given against the opinion which lawyers are paid to uphold, is
anything but based on truth; and “perjury” “conspiracy,” and
“peril of your immortal soul,” are light expressions to throw at
the heads of those who may prove (not the speaker, there would
then be some excuse for the hasty words of personal anger, but)
the hirer of the speaker to be wrong, or mistaken.

But when once Will had attained his end, and felt that his tale,
or part of a tale, would be heard by judge and jury; when once
he saw Jem standing safe and well before him (even though he
saw him pale and careworn at the felon’s bar); his courage took
the shape of presence of mind, and he awaited the examination
with a calm, unflinching intelligence, which dictated the clearest
and most pertinent answers. He told the story you know so well.
How his leave of absence being nearly expired, he had resolved
to fulfil his promise, and go to see an uncle residing in the Isle of
Man; how his money (sailor-like) was all expended in Manchester,
and how, consequently, it had been necessary for him to walk to
Liverpool, which he bad accordingly done on the very night of
the murder, accompanied as far as Hollins Green by his friend
and cousin, the prisoner at the bar. He was clear and distinct
in every corroborative circumstance, and gave a short account of
the singular way in which he had been recalled from his outward-
bound voyage, and the terrible anxiety he had felt, as the pilot-
boat had struggled home against the wind. The jury felt that
their opinion (so nearly decided half an hour ago) was shaken
‘and disturbed in a very uncomfortable and perplexing way, and

‘ere almost grateful to the counsel for the prosecution, when he

 


358

any one, for the biggest fee as ever lawyer got for doing dirty
work, Will you tell, Sir? — But I’m ready, my lord judge, to
take my oath as many times as your lordship or the jury would
like, to testify to things having happened just asIsaid. There’s
O'Brien, the pilot, in court now. Would somebody with a wig on
please to ask him how much he can say for me?”

It was a good idea, and caught at by the counsel for the de-
fence. O’Brien gave just such testimony as was required to clear
‘Will from all suspicion. He had witnessed the pursuit, he had
heard the conversation which took place between the boat and
the ship; he had given Will a homeward passage in his boat.
And the character of an accredited pilot, appointed by Trinity
House, was known to be above suspicion.

Mr. Carsons sank back on his seat in sickening despair. He
knew enough of courts to be aware of the extreme unwillingness
of juries to convict, even where the evidence is most clear, when
the penalty of such conviction is death. At the period of the trial
most condemnatory to the prisoner, he had repeated this fact to
himself, in order to damp his too certain expectation of acon-
viction. Now it needed not repetition, for it forced itself upon
his consciousness, and he seemed to know, even before the jury
retired to consult, that by some trick, some negligence, some
miserable hocus-pocus, the murderer of his child, his darling, his
Absalom, who had never rebelled, — the slayer of his unburied
boy would slip through the fangs of justice, and walk free and
unscathed over that earth where his son would never more
be seen.

It was even so. The prisoner hid his face once more to shield
the expression of an emotion he could not control, from the
notice of the over-curious; Job Legh ceased his eager talking to
Mr. Bridgenorth ; Charley looked grave and earnest; for the jury
filed one by one back into their box, and the question was asked.
to which such an awful answer might be given.

The verdict they had come to was unsatisfactory to them-
selves at last; neither being convinced of his innocence, nor yet
quite willing to believe him guilty in the teeth of the alibi. But
the punishment that awaited him, if guilty, was so terrible, and so
unnatural a sentence for man to pronounce on man, that the

 


360

 

‘The crowd made way, and kept their garments tight about
them, as Jem passed, for about him there still hung the taint of
the murderer.

He was in the open air, and free once more! Although many
looked on him with suspicion, faithful friends closed round him;
his arm was unresistingly pumped up and down by his cousin and
Job; when one was tired, the other took up the wholesome
exercise, while Ben Sturgis was working off his interest in the
scene by scolding Charley for walking on his head round and
round Mary’s sweetheart, for a sweetheart he was now satis-
factorily ascertained to be, in spite of her assertion to the con-
trary. And all time Jem himself felt bewildered and dazzled;
he would have given any thing for an hour’s uninterrupted
thought on the occurrences of the past week, and the new visions
raised up during the morning; aye, even though that tranquil
hour were to be'passed in the hermitage of his quiet prison cell.
‘The first question sobbed out by his choking voice, oppressed
with emotion, was,

“Where is she?”

They led him to the room where his mother sat. They had
told her of her son’s acquittal, and now she was laughing, and
crying, and talking, and giving way to all those feelings which
she had restrained with such effort during the last few days.
‘They brought her son to her, and she threw herself upon his
neck, weeping there. He returned her embrace, but looked
around, beyond. Excepting his mother there was no one in the
room, but the friends who had entered with him.

“Eh, lad!” she said, when she found voice to speak. “See
what it is to have behaved thysel! I could putin a good word for
thee, and the jury could na go and hang thee in the face of
th’ character I gave thee. Was na it » good thing they did na
keep me from Liverpool? But I would come; I knew I could do
thee good, bless thee, mylad. But thou ’rt very white, and all
ofa tremble.”

He kissed her again and again, but looking round as if search-
ing for some one he could not find, the first words he uttered
were still,

“Where is she?”

 

 

362

Mary as the guilty destroyer of her lover, how much more was he

bound now to labour to prevent any word of bers from inculpa-
ting her father, now that she was his own; now that she had
braved so much to rescue him; and now that her poor brain had
lost all guiding and controlling power over her words.

All that night long Jem wandered up and down the narrow
precincts of Ben Sturgis’s house. In the little bed-room where
‘Mrs. Sturgis alternately tended Mary, and wept over the violence
of her illness, he listened to her ravings; each sentence of which
had its own peculiar meaning and reference, intelligible to bis
mind, till her words rose to the wild pitch of agony, that no one
could alleviate, and he could bear itno longer, and stole, sick,
and miserable down stairs, where Ben Sturgis thought it his duty
to snore away in an arm-chair instead of his bed, under the idea
that he should thus be more ready for active service, such as
fetching the doctor to revisit his patient.

Before it was fairly light, Jem (wide awake, and listening with
an earnest attention he could not deaden, however painful its
results proved) heard a gentle subdued knock at the house door;
it was no business of his, to be sure to openit, but as Ben slept
on, he thought he would see who the early visitor might be, and
ascertain if there was any occasion for disturbing either host or
hostess. It was Job Legh who stood there, distinct against the
outer light of the street.

“How is she? Eh! poor soul! is that her! no need to ask!
How strange her voice sounds! Screech! screech! and she so
low, sweet-spoken, when she ’s well! ‘Thou must keep up heart,
old boy, and not look so dismal, thysel.””

“can't help it, Job; it’s past a man’s bearing to hear such a
one as she is, going on as she is doing; even if I did not care for
her, it would cut me sore to see one so young, and—I can’t speak
of it, Job, as aman should do,” said Jem, his sobs choking him.

“Let me in, will you?” said Job, pushing past him, for all
this time Jem had stood holding the door, unwilling to admit
Job where he might hear so much that would be suggestive to
one acquainted with the parties that Mary named. .

“Jd more than one reason for coming betimes. I wanted to
shear how yon poor wench was; — that stood first. Late last

 

364

“T should na wonder, either,” answered Job. “Folk in her
way say many and many a strange thing; and th’ best way is
never to mind them. Now you take your mother home, Jem,
and stay by her till old Alice is gone, and trust me for seeing
after Mary.”

Jem felt how right Job was, and could not resist what he
knew to be his duty, but I cannot tell you how heavy and sick at
heart he was as he stood at the door to take alast, fond, linger-
ing look at Mary; he saw her sitting up in bed, her golden hair,
dimmed with her one day’s illness, floating behind her, her
head bound round with wetted cloths, her features all agitated,
even to distortion, with the pangs of her anxiety.

Her lover's eyes filled with tears. Hecouldnothope. The
elasticity of his heart had been crushed out of him by early
sorrows; and now, especially, the dark side of every thing
seemed to be presented to him. What if she died, just when he
knew the treasure, the untold treasure he possessed in her love!
‘What if (worse than death) she remained a poor gibbering
maniac all her life long (and mad people do live to be old some-
times, even under all the pressure of their burden), terror
distracted as she was now; and no one able to comfort her!

“Jem!” said Job, partly guessing the other’s feelings by
his own. “Jem!” repeated he, arresting his attention before
he spoke. Jem turned round, the little motion causing the tears
to overflow and trickle down his cheeks. “Thou must trust in
God, and leave her in His hands.” He spoke hushed, and
low; but the words sunk all the more into Jem’s heart, and gave
him strength to tear himself away.

He found his mother (notwithstanding that she had but just
regained her child through Mary's instrumentality) half inclined
to resent his having passed the night in anxious devotion to the

lid. She dwelt on the duties of children to their
parents (above all others), till Jem could hardly believe the re-
lative positions they had held only yesterday, when she was
struggling with and controlling every instinct of her nature, only
because he wished it. However, the recollection of that yester-
day, with its hair’s breadth between him and a felon’s death,
and the love that had lightened the dark shadow, made him bear

  


366

watching for some word or sign which should betoken his ‘wish
to return to Mary. And yet go to Liverpool he must and would,
as soon as the funeral was over, if but for a simple glimpse of his
darling. For Job had never written; indeed, any necessity for
his so doing had never entered his head. If Mary died, he
would announce it personally; if she recovered, he meant to
bring her home with him. Writing was to him little more than
an auxiliary to natural history; a way of ticketing specimens,
not of expressing thoughts.

The consequence of this want of intelligence as to Mary's
state was, that Jem was constantly anticipating that every person
and every scrap of paper was to convey to him the news of her
death. He could not endure this state long; but he resolved not
to disturb the house by announcing to his mother his proposed
intention of returning to Liverpool, until the dead had been
carried forth.

On Sunday afternoon, they laid her low with many tears.
‘Will wept as one who would not be comforted.

The old childish feeling came over him, the feeling of lone-
liness at being left among strangers.

By and bye, Margaret timidly stole near him, as if waiting
to console; and soon his passion sank down to grief, and grief
gave way to melancholy, and though he felt as though he never
could be joyful again, he was all the while unconsciously ap-
proaching nearer to the full happiness of calling Margaret his
own, and a golden thread was interwoven even now with the
darkness of his sorrow. Yet it was on his arm that Jane
Wilson leant on her return homewards. Jem took charge of
Margaret.

“Margaret, I’m bound for Liverpool by the first train to-
morrow; I must set your grandfather at liberty.”

“I'm sure he likes nothing better than watching over poor
Mary; he loves her nearly as well as me. But let me go! I have
been so full of poor Alice, I ve never thought of it before; I
can’t do so much as many a one, but Mary will like to have a
woman about her that she knows. I’m sorry I waited to be re-
minded, Jem!” replied Margaret, with some little self-
reproach.


368

when you 'll likely be back. If you come home to-morrow night,
and Will's there, perhaps I need not step up?”

“Yes, Margaret, do! I shan’t leave easy unless you go
some time in the day to see mother. I'll come to-night, though;
and now good-bye. Stay! do you think you could just coax
poor Will to walk a bit home with you, that I might speak to
mother by myself?”

No! that Margaret could not do. That was expecting too
great a sacrifice of bashful feeling.

But the object was accomplished by Will’s going up-stairs
immediately on their return to the house, to indulge his mournful
thoughts alone. As soon as Jem and his mother were left
by themselves, he began on the subject uppermost in his mind.

“Mother!”

She put her handkerchief from her eyes, and turned quickly
round so as to face him where he stood, thinking what best to
say. The little action annoyed him, and he rushed at once
into the subject.

“Mother! Iam going back to Liverpool to-morrow morning
to see how Mary Barton is.””

“And what’s Mary Barton to thee, that thou shouldst be
running after her in that-a-way?””

“If she lives, she shall be my wedded wife. If she dies —
mother, I can’t speak of what I shall feel if she dies.” His voice
was choked in his throat.

For an instant his mother was interested by his words; and
then came back the old jealousy of being supplanted in the af-
fections of that son, who had been, as it were, newly born to
her, by the escape he had so lately experienced from danger.
So she hardened her heart against entertaining any feeling of
sympathy; and turned away from the face, which recalled the
earnest look of his childhood, when he had come to her in some
trouble, sure of help and comfort.

And coldly she spoke, in those which tones Jem knew and
dreaded, even before the meaning they expressed was fally shaped.
“Thou 'rt old enough to please 'thysel. Old mothers are cast
aside, and what they ‘ve borne forgotten as soon as a pretty face
comes across. I might have thought of that last Taesday, when

 

370

“You may say so, lad! Such days as will never come again to
me, atany rate.” She sighed sorrowfully.

“Mother!” said he, atlast, stopping short, and taking her
hand in his with tender affection, “you'd like me to be as happy
aman as my father was before me, would not you? You'd like
me to have some one to make me as happy as you made father?
Now, would.not you, dear mother?”

“I did not make him as happy as I mightha’ done,” mur-
mured she, ina low, sad voice of self-reproach. Th’ accident
gave a jar to my temper it’s never got the better of; and now he’s
gone, where he can never know how I grieve for having frabbed
him as I did.”

“Nay, mother, we don’t know that!” said Jem, with gentle
soothing. “Any how, you and father got along with as few rubs
as most people. But for his sake, dear mother, don’t say me nay,
now that I come to you to ask your blessing before setting out to
see her, who is to be my wife, if ever woman is; for his sake, if
not for mine, love her who I shall bring home to be to me all you
were to him: and mother! I do not ask for a truer, or a tenderer
heart than yours is, in the long run.”

‘The hard look left her face; though her eyes were still averted
from Jem’s gaze, it was more because they were brimming over
with tears, called forth by his words, than because any an;
feeling yet remained. And when his manly voice died away in
low pleadings, she lifted up her hands, and bent down her son’s
head below the level of her own; and then she solemnly uttered
a blessing.

“God bless thee, Jem, my own dearlad. And mayHe bless
Mary Barton for thy sake.”

Jem’s heart leaped up, and from this time hope took the place
of fear in his anticipations with regard to Mary.

“Mother! you show your own true self to Mary, and she ‘ll
love you as dearly as I do.” ‘

So with some few smiles, and some few tears, and much
earnest talking, the evening wore away.

“T must be off to see Margaret. Why, it’s near ten o’clock!
Could you have thought it?” Now don’t you stop up for me,

 

372

would have been to know that I might hope to have her for my
wife! that’s to say if God spares her!”

“She would not have known it, even if you could have told
her this last fortnight, — ever since you went away she’s been
thinking always that she was a little child at her mother’s apron-
string. She must have been a happy little thing; it was such a
pleasure to her to think about those early days, when she lay old
and gray on her death-bed.”

“Tnever knew any one seem more happy all her life long.”

“Ay! and how gentle and easy her death was! she thought
her mother was near her.”

They fell into calm thought about those last peaceful happy
hours.

Itstruck eleven. Jem started up.

“J should have been gone long age. Give me the bundle.
You ‘ll not forget my mother. Good night, Margaret.”

She let him out and bolted the door behind him. He stood
on the steps to adjust some fastening about the bundle. The
court, the street, was deeply still. Long ago all had retired to
rest on that quiet Sabbath evening. The stars shone down on
the silent deserted streets, and the clear soft moonlight fell in
bright masses, leaving the steps on which Jem stood in shadow.

‘A foot-full was heard along the pavement, slow and heavy
was the sound. Before Jem had ended his little piece of business,
a form had glided into sight; awan, feeble figure, bearing with
evident and painful labour, a jug of water from the neighbour-
ing pump. It went before Jem, turned up the court at the corner
of which he was standing, passed into the broad, calm light;
and there, with bowed head, sinking and shrunk body, Jem re-
cognised John Barton.

‘No haunting ghost could have had less of the energy of life in
its involuntary motions than he, ‘who, nevertheless, went on
with the same measured clock-work tread until the door of his
own house was reached. And then he disappeared, and the
latch fell feebly to, and made a faint and wavering sound, break-
ing the solemn silence of the night. Then all again was still.

For a minute or two Jem stood motionless, stunned by the
thoughts which the sight of Mary's father had called up.

real motives, I do assure you it was from just such an involved
set of thoughts that Jem drew the resolution to act as if he had
not seen that phantom likeness of John Barton; himself, yet
not himself.

CHAPTER XXXIV.
“Dizwelt, Forgiveness! Ob, forgiveness, and a grave!
Mary. God knows thy heart, my father! and I shudder
To think what thou perchance hast acted.
Dizwell. Ob! ’
Mary. No common load of woe is thine, my father.”
Exuiot's ‘Kerwonaw.’

Mary still hovered between life and death when Jem arrived
at the house where she lay; and the doctors were as yet unwill-
ing to compromise their wisdom by allowing too much hope to be
entertained. But the state of things, if not less anxious, was
less distressing than when Jem had quitted her. She lay now in
astupor, which was partly disease, and partly exhaustion after
the previous excitement.

And now Jem found the difficulty which every one who has
watched by a sick bed knows full well; and which is perhaps
more insurmountable to men than it is to women, — the difficulty
of being patient, and trying not to expect any visible change for
long, long hours of sad monotony.

But after awhile the reward came. The laboured breathing
became lower and softer, the heavy look of oppressive pain
melted away from the face, and a languor that was almost peace
took the place of suffering. She slept a natural sleep; and they
stole about on tip-toe, and spoke low, and softly, and hardly
dared to breathe, however much they longed to sigh out their
thankful relief.

She opened her eyes. Her mind was in the tender state of a
lately-born infant’s. She was pleased with the gay but not
dazzling colours of the paper; soothed by the subdued light;
and quite sufficiently amused by looking at all the objects in the
room — the drawing of the ships, the festoons of the curtain,
the bright flowers on the painted backs of the chairs—to care for
any stronger excitement. She wondered at the ball of glass,
containing various coloured sends from the Isle of Wight, or

 

376

mother’s dwelling-pitte, and there his plans for life had been to
be worked out; plans, which the suspicion and imprisonment he
had fallen into, had thrown for a time into a chaos, which his
presence was required to arrange into form. For he might find,
in spite of a jury’s verdict, that too strong a taint was on his
character for him ever to labour in Manchester again. He re-
membered the manner in which some one suspected of having
been a convict was shunned by masters and men, when he had
accidentally met with work in their foundry; the recollection
smote him now, how he himself had thought that it did not be-
come an honest upright man to associate with one who had been
aprisoner. He could not choose but think on that poor humble
being, with his downcast conscious look; hunted out of the
workshop, where he had sought to earn an honest livelihood, by
the looks, and half-spoken words, and the black silence of re-
pugnance (worse than words to bear), that met him on all
sides.

Jem felt that his own character had been attainted; and that
to many it might still appear suspicious. He knew that he could
convince the world, by a future as blameless as his past had
been, that he was innocent. But at the same time he saw that
he must have patience, and nerve himself for some trials; and
the sooner these were undergone, the sooner he was aware of
the place he held in men’s estimation, the better. He longed to
have presented himself once more at the foundry; and then the
reality would drive away the pictures that would (unbidden)
come, ofashunned man, eyed askance by all, and driven forth
to shape out some new career.

I said every reason “but one”’ inclined Jem to hasten Mary’s
return us soon as she was sufficiently convalescent. That one
was the meeting which awaited her at home.

Turn it over as Jem would, he could not decide whet was the
best course to pursue. He could compel himself to any line of
conduct that his reason and his sense of right told him to be
desirable; but they did not tell him it was desirable to speak to
Mary, in her tender state of mind and body, ofher father. How
much would be implied by the mere mention of his name! Speak
it as calmly, and as indifferently as he might, he could not. avoid

 

 

378

my going home. Let us say no more about it, dear Jem. I
must go home, and I must go alone.”

“Not alone, Mary!”

“Yes, alone! I cannot tell you why I ask it. And if you
guess, I know you well enough to be eure you ‘ll understand why
Task you never to speak on that again to me, till begin. Pro-
aise, dear Jem, promise!”

He promised; to gratify that beseeching face he promised.
And then he repented, and felt as ifhe had done ill. Then
again he felt as if she were the best judge, and knowing all (per-
haps more than even he did), might be forming plans which his
interference would mar.

+ One thing was certain! it was a miserable thing to have this
awful forbidden ground of discourse; to guess at each other's
thoughts, when eyes were averted, and cheeks blanched, and
words stood still, arrested in their flow by some casual allusion.

At last a day, fine enough for Mary to travel on, arrived. She
had wished to go, but now her courage failed her. How could
she have said she was weary of that quiet house, where even Ben
Sturgis’ grumblings only made a kind of harmonious bass in the
concord between him and his wife, so thoroughly did they know
each other with the knowledge of many years! How could she
have longed to quit that little peaceful room where she had ex-
perienced such loving tendence! . Even the very check bed-
curtains became dear to her, under the idea of seeing them no
more. If it was so with inanimate objects, if they had such
power of exciting regret, what were her feelings with regard to
the kind old couple, who had taken the stranger in, and cared
for her, and nursed her, as though she had been a daughter!
Each wilful sentence spoken in the half unconscious irritation
of feebleness came now with avenging self-reproach to her me-
mory, as she hung about Mrs. Sturgis, with many tears, which
served instead of words to express her gratitude and love.

Ben bustled about with the square bottle of Golden Wasser in
one of his hands, and a small tumbler in the other; he went to
Mary, Jem, and his wife in succession, pouring out a glass for
each, and bidding them drink it to keep their spirits up: but as
each severally refused; he drank it himself; and passed on to

 

380

But her filial duty, nay, her love and gratitude for many
deeds‘of kindness done to her as a little child, conquered all
fear. She would endure all imaginable terrors, although of daily
occurrence. And she would patiently bear all wayward violence
of temper; more than patiently would she bear it — pitifully, as
one who knew of some awful curse awaiting the blood-shedder.
She would watch over him tenderly, as the Innocent should
watch over the Guilty; awaiting the gracious seasons, wherein
to pour oil and balm into the bitter wounds.

With the untroubled peace which the resolve to endure to the
end gives, she approached the’ house that from habit she still
called home, but which possessed the holiness of home no
longer.

“Jem!” said she, as they stood at the entrance to the court,
close by Job Legh’s door, “You must go in there and wait half-
an-hour. Not less. If, in that time I don’t come back, yougo
your ways to your mother. Give her my dear love. I will send
by Margaret when I want to sce you.” She sighed heavily.

“Mary! Mary! I cannot leave you. You speak as coldly as
if we were to be nought to each other. And my heart’s bound
upinyou. Iknow why you bid me keep away, but —”

She put her hand on his arm, as he spoke in a loud agitated.
tone; she looked into his face with upbraiding love in her eyes,
and then she said, while her lips quivered, and he felt her whole
frame trembling:

“Dear Jem! I often could have told you more of love, if I
had not once spoken out so free. Remember that time, Jem,
if ever you think me cold. Then, the love that’s in my heart
would outin words; but now, though I’m silent on the pain I’m
feeling in quitting you, the love is in my heart all the same. But
this is not the time to speak on such things. IfI do not do what
I feel to be right now, I may blame myself all my life long! Jem,
you promised —”

And so saying she left him. She went quicker than she would
otherwise have passed over those few yards of ground, for fear
he should still try to accompany her. Her hand was on the latch,
and in a breath the door was opened.

There sat her father, still and motionless — not even turning

 

382

 

too, he had given Margaret some good reason for not intruding
upon her friend for this night at least, otherwise Mary would have
seen her before now.

But to-morrow, — would she not come in to-morrow? And
who so quick as blind Margaret in noticing tones, and sighs, and
even silence?

She did not give herself time for further thought, her desire
to be once more with her father was too pressing; but she opened
the door, before she well knew what to say.

“It’s Mary Barton! I know her by her breathing! Grand-
father, it’s Mary Barton!”

Margaret's joy at meeting her, the open demonstration ef her
love, affected Mary much; she could not keep from crying, and
sat down weak and agitated on the first chair she could find.

“Ay, ay, Mary! thou 'rt looking a bit different to when I saw
thee last. Thou ’It give Jem and me good characters for sick
nurses, I trust. If all trades fail, I'll turn to that. Jem’s place
is for life, I reckon. Nay, never redden so, lass. You and
he know each other’s minds by this time!”

Margaret held her hand, and gently smiled into her face.

Job Legh took the candle up, and began a leisurely in-
spection.

“Thou hast gotten a bit of pink in thy cheeks, — not much;
but when last I see thee, thy lips were as whiteasasheet. Thy
nose is sharpish at th’ end; thou ’rt more like thy father than
ever thou wert before. Lord! child, what’s the matter? Art
thou going to faint?”

For Mary had sickened at the mention of that name; _yet she
felt that now or never was the time to speak.

“Father's come home!” she said, “but he ’s very poorly; I
never saw him ashe is now, before. I asked Jem not to come
near him for fear it might fidget him.”

She spoke hastily, and (to her own ides) in an unnatural
manner. But they did not seem to notice it, nor to take the hint
she had thrown out of compauy being unacceptable; for Job
Legh directly put down some insect, which he was impaling ons
corking-pin, and exclaimed,

“Thy father come home! Why, Jem never said a word of it!

 

384

hushed manner as on that first dreary afternoon. He ate, — but
without that relish; and food seemed no longer to nourish him,
for each morning bis face had caught more of the ghastly fore-
shadowing of Death.

The neighbours kept strangely aloof. Of late years John
Barton had had a repellant power about him, felt by all, except
to the few who had either known him in his better and happier
days, or those to whom he had given his sympathy and his confi-
dence. People did not care to enter the doors of one, whose
very depth of thoughtfulness rendered him moody and stern.
And now they contented themselves with a kind inquiry when
they saw Mary in her goings-out or in her comings-in._ With her
oppressing knowledge, she imagined their reserved conduct
stranger than it was in reality. She missed Job and Margaret
too; who, in all former times of sorrow or anxiety since their ac-
quaintance first began, had been ready with their sympathy.

But most of all she missed the delicious luxury she had lately
enjoyed in having Jem’s tender love at hand every hour of the
day, to ward off every wind of heaven, and every disturbing
thought.

She knew he was often hovering about the house; though the
knowledge seemed to come more by intuition, than by any posi-
tive sight or sound for the first day ortwo. On the third day, she
met him at Job Legh’s.

They received her with every effort of cordiality; but still
there was a cobweb-veil of separation between them, to which
Mary was morbidly acute. While in Jem’s voice, and eyes, and
manner, there was every evidence of most passionate, most ad-
miring, and most trusting love. ‘The trust was shown by his re-
spectful silence on that one point of reserve on which she had
interdicted conversation.

He left Job Legh’s house when she did. They lingered on
the step; he holding her hand between both of his, as loth to let
her go, he questioned her as to when he should see her again.

“Mother does so want to see you,” whispered he. “Can you
come to see her to-morrow, or when?”

“I cannot tell,” replied she, softly. “Not yet. Wait awhile;

 

 

 

Hodson it was even copied into aLondon paper. ‘You 've set
up heroine on your own account, Mary Barton. How did you
like standing witness? Ar’n’t them lawyers impudent things?
staring at one so. I'll be bound you wished you'd taken my
offer, and borrowed my black watered scarf! Now didn’t,you,
Mary? Speak truth!”

“To tell truth, Inever thought about it, then, Sally. How
could I?” asked she, reproachfully.

“Oh—I forgot. You were all for that stupid ‘James Wilson.
Well! if I’ve ever the luck to go witness on atrial, see if I don’t
pick up a better beau than the prisoner. I’ll aim at a lawyer's
clerk, but I ’ll not take less than a turnkey.”

Cast down as Mary was, she could hardly keep from smiling
at the idea, so wildly incongruous with the scene she had really
undergone, of looking out for admirers during a trial for murder.

“I’dno thought to be looking out for beaux,I can assure you,
Sally. — But don’t let us talk any more about it, I can’t bear to
think onit. How is Miss Simmonds? and everybody?”

“Oh, very well; and by the way she gave me a bit of a message
for you. Youmay come back to work if you'll behave yourself, she
says. Itold youshe’dbe glad to have you back,afterall this piece of
business, by way of tempting people to come to her shop. They'd
come from Salford to have a peep at you, for six months at least.”

“Don't talk so; I cannot come, I can never face Miss Sim-
monds again. And even ifIcould,” she stopped, and blushed.

“Aye! [know what you are thinking on. But that will not be
this some time, as he’s turned off from the foundry, — you ’d
better think twice afore refusing Miss Simmonds’ offer.””

“Turned off from the foundry? Jem?” cried Mary.

“To be sure! didn’t you know it? Decent men were not
going to work with a—no! I suppose I mustn’t say it, seeing you
‘went to such trouble to get up an alii; not that I should think
much the worse of a spirited young fellow for falling foul of »
rival, — they always do at the theatre.”

But Mary's thoughts were with Jem. How good he had been
never to name his dismissal to her. How much he had had to
endure for her sake!

“Tell me all about it,” she gasped out.

lived, Jem overtook her. He came upon her suddenly, and she
started.

“You 're going to see mother?” he asked, tenderly, placing
her arm within his, and slackening his pace.

“Yes, and youtoo. Oh, Jem, isittrue? tell me.”

She felt rightly that he would guess the meaning of her only
half expressed inquiry. He hesitated a moment before he an-
swered her.

“Darling, itis; it’s no use hiding it— if you mean that. I’m
no longer to work at Duncombe’s foundry. It’s no time (to my
mind) to have secrets from each other, though I did not name it
yesterday, thinking you might fret. I shall soon get work again,
never fear.”

“But why did they turn you off, when the jury had said you
‘were innocent?”,

“I was not just to say turned off, though I don’t think I could
have well staid on. A good number of the men managed to let
out they should not like to work under me again; there were
some few who knew me well enough to feel I could not have done
it, but more were doubtful; and one spoke to young Mr. Dun-
combe, hinting at what they thought.”

“Oh, Jem! what a shame!” said Mary, with mournful in-
dignation.

“Nay, darling! I’m not for blaming them. Poor fellows like
them have nought to stand upon and be proud of but their cha-
racter, and its fitting they should take care of that, and keep that
free from soil and taint.”

“But you, — what could they get but good from you? They
might have known you by this time.”

“So some do; the overlooker, I’m sure, would know I ’m in-
nocent. Indeed, he said as much to-day; and he said he had had
some talk with old Mr. Duncombe, and they thought it might be
better if I left Manchester for a bit; they ’d recommend me to
some other place.”

But Mary could only shake her head in a mournfal way, and
repeat her words,

“They might have known thee better, Jem.”

 

390 7
in ignorance of his dismiseal from the foundry: and it was her
way to prepare some little pleasure, some little comfort for those
she loved; and if they, unwittingly , did not appear at the proper
time to enjoy her preparation, she worked herself up into a state
of fretfulness which found vent in upbraidings as soon as ever
the objects of her care appeared, thereby marring the peace
which should ever be the atmosphere of a home, however
humble; and causing s feeling almost amounting to loathing to
arise at the sight of the “stalled ox,” which, though an effect and
proof of careful love, has been the cause of 60 much disturbance.

Mrs. Wilson had first sighed, and then grumbled to herself,
over the increasing toughness of the potatoe-cukes she had made
for her son’s tea.

‘The door opened, and he came in; his face brightening into
proud smiles, Mary Barton hanging on his arm, blushing and
dimpling, with cye-lids veiling the happy light of her eyes, —
there was around the young couple a radiant atmosphere — a
glory of happiness.

Could his mother mar it? Could she break into it with her
Martha-like cares? Only for one moment did she remember her
sense of injury, —her wasted trouble, — and then, her whole
woman's heart heaving with motherly love and sympathy, she
opened her arms, and received Mary into them, as shedding tears
of agitated joy, she murmured in her ear,

“Bless thee, Mary, bless thee! Only make him happy, and
God bless thee for ever!”

It took some of Jem’s self-command to separate those whom
he so much loved, and who were beginning, for his sake, to love
one another so dearly. But the time for his meeting John Barton.
drew on: and it was along way to his house.

As they walked briskly thither, they hardly spoke; though
many thoughts were in their minds.

‘The sun had not long set, but the first faint shade of twilight
was over all; and when they opened the door, Jem could hardly
perceive the objects within by the waning light of day, and the
flickering fire-blaze.

But Mary saw all at a glance.

Her eye, accustomed to what was usual in the aspect of the

 

. 392

 

thoughts. I didn’t! and I'll tell you why. I didn’t know but
that I should be more haunted than ever with the recollection
of my sin. Oh! God above only can tell the agony with which
I’ve repented me of it, and part perhaps because I feared He
would think I were impatient of the misery He sent as punish-
ment — far, far worse misery than any hanging, Sir;”” he ceased
from excess of emotion. .

‘Then he began again.

“Sin’ that day (it may be very wicked, Sir, but it’s the
truth) I’ve kept thinking and thinking if I were but in that world
where they say God is, He would, may be, teach me right
from wrong, even if it were with many stripes. I've been sore
puzzled here. I would go through Hell-fire if I could but-get
free from sin at last, it’s such an awful thing. As for hanging,
that’s just nought at all.”

His exhaustion compelled him to sitdown. Mary rushed to
him. It seemed as if till then he had been unaware of her
presence.

“Ay, ay, wench!” said he, fecbly, “is it thee? Where's
Jem Wilson?”

Jem came forward. John Barton spoke again, with many a
break, and gasping pause,

“Lad! thou hast borne a deal for me. It’s the meanest
thing I ever did to leave thee to bear the brunt. Thou, who
wert as innocent of any knowledge of it as the babe unborn.
I'll not bless thee for it. Blessing from such as me would not
bring thee any good. Thou lt love Mary, though she is my
child.”

He ceased, and there was a pause for a few seconds.

Then Mr. Carsons turned to go. When his hand was on the
latch of the door, he hesitated for an instant.

“You can have no doubt for what purposeI go. Straight to
the police-office, to send men to take care of you, wretched
man, and your accomplice. To-morrow morning your tale shall
‘be repeated to those who can commit you to gaol, and before
long you shall have the opportunity of trying how desirable
hanging is.”

“Oh, Sir!” said /Mary, springing forward, and catching

 

 

394

ing of the heart; for was not this the very anguish he had felt for
little Tom, in years so long gone by that they seemed like
another life!

‘The mourner before him was no longer the employer; a
being of another race, eternally placed in antagonistic attitude;
going through the world glittering like gold, with a stony heart
within, which knew no sorrow but through the accidents of
Trade; no longer the enemy, the oppressor, but a very poor,
and desolate old man.

‘The sympathy for suffering, formerly so prevalent a feeling
with him, again filled John Barton’s heart, and almost impelled
him to speak (as best he could) some earnest, tender words to
the stern man, shaking in his agony.

But who was he, that he should utter sympathy, or consola-
tion? The cause of all this woe.

Oh blasting thought! Oh miserable remembrance! He had
forfeited all right to bind up his brother’s wounds.

Stunned by the thought, he sank upon the seat, almost
crushed with the knowledge of the consequences of his own
action; for he had no more imagined to himself the blighted
home, and the miserable parents, than does the soldier, who
discharges his musket, picture to himself the desolation of the
wife, and the pitiful cries of the helpless little ones, who are in
an instant to be made widowed, and fatherless.

To intimidate a class of men, known only to those below
them as desirous to obtain the greatest quantity of work for the
lowest wages, — at most to remove an overbearing partner from
an obnoxious firm, who stood in the way of those who struggled
as well as they were able to obtain their rights, — this was the
light in which John Barton had viewed his deed; and even so
viewing it, after the excitement had passed away, the Avenger,
the sure Avenger, had found him-out.

But now he knew that he bad killed aman, and a brother, —
now he knew that no good thing could come outof this evil, even
to the sufferers whose cause he had so blindly espoused.

He lay across the table, broken-hearted. Every fresh qui-
vering sob of Mr. Carsons’ stabbed him to his soul.

He felt execrated by all; and as if he could never lay bare the

 

 

“Let my trespasses be unforgiven, so that I may have ven-
geance for my son's murder.”

He tried to shake off the spiritual impression made by this
imagination. He was feverish and ill, — and no wonder.

So he turned to go homewards; not, as he had threatened,
tothe police-office. After all (he told himself), that would do
in the morning. No fear of the man’s escaping, unless he
escaped to the Grave.

So he tried to banish the phantom voices and shapes which
came unbidden to his brain, and to recall his balance of mind by
walking calmly and slowly, and noticing every thing which
struck his senses.

It was a warm soft evening in spring, and there were many
persons in the streets. Among others, a nurse with a little girl
in her charge, conveying her home from some children’s gaicty;
a dance most likely, for the lovely little creature was daintily
decked out in soft, snowy muslin; and her fairy feet tripped
along by her nurse’s side, as if to the measure of some tune she
had lately kept time to.

Suddenly up behind her there came a rough, rude errand-
boy, nine or ten years of age; a giant he looked by the fairy-
child, as she fluttered along. I don’t know how it was, but in
some awkward way he knocked the poor little girl down upon
the hard pavement as he brushed rudely past, not much caring
whom he hurt, so that he got along.

The child arose sobbing with pain; and not without cause,
for blood was dropping down from the face, but a minute before
80 fair and bright — dropping down on the pretty frock, making
those scarlet marks so terrible to little children.

The nurse, a powerful woman, had seized the boy, just as
Mr. Carsons (who had seen the whole transaction) came up.

“You naughty little rascal! I'l give you to # policeman,
that I will! Do you see how you've hurt the little girl? Do
you?” accompanying every sentence with a violent jerk of pas-
sionate anger.

The lad looked hard, and defying; but withal terrified at the
threat of the policeman, those ogres of our streets to all unlucky

head down on the open page, and let the tears fall
slowly on the spotless leaves.

His son’s murderer was discovered; had confessed his guilt;
and yet (strange to say)he could not hate him with the vehemence
of hatred he had felt, when he had imagined hima young man,
fall of lusty life, defying all laws, human and divine. In spite
of his desire to retain the revengeful feeling he considered as a
duty to his dead son, something of pity would steal in for the
poor, wasted skeleton of a man, the smitten creature, who had
told him of his sin, and implored his pardon that night.

In the days of his childhood and youth, Mr. Carsons had been
accustomed to poverty; but it was honest decent poverty ; not the
grinding squalid misery he had remarked in every part of John
Barton’s house, and which contrasted strangely with the pompous
sumptuousness of the room in which he now sate. Unaccustomed
wonder filled his mind at the reflection of the different lote of the
brethren of mankind.

Then he roused himself from his reverie, and turned to the
object of his search — the Gospel , where he half expected to find
the tender pleading. ‘They know not what they do.”

It was mirk midnight by this time, and the house was stil} and
quict. There was nothing to interrupt the old man in his un-
wonted study.

Years ago, the Gospel had been his'task-book in learning to
read. So many years ago, that he had become familiar with the
events before he could comprehend the Spirit that made the Life.

He fell to the narrative now afresh, with all the interest of a
little child. He began at the beginning, and read on almost
greedily, understanding for the first time the full meaning of the
story. He came to the end; the awful End. And there were the
haunting words of pleading.

He shut the book, and thought deeply.

All night long, the Arch-angel combated with the Demon.

All night long, others watched by the bed of Death. John
Barton had revived to fitful intelligence. He spoke at times with
even something of his former energy; and in the racy Lancashire
dialect he had always used when speaking freely.

“You see I've go often been hankering after the right way;

 

 

400

had but forgiven me,” — and then came earnest, passionate,
broken words of prayer.

Job Legh had gone home like one struck “down with the un-
expected shock. Mary and Jem together waited the approach
of death; butas the final struggle drew on, and morning dawned,
Jem suggested some alleviation to the gasping breath, to pur-
chase which he left the house in search of a druggist’s shop, which
should be open at that early hour.

During his absence, Barton grew worse; he had fallen across
the bed, and his breathing seemed almost stopped; in vain did
Mary strive to raise him, her sorrow and exhaustion had rendered.
her too weak.

So, on hearing some one enter the house-place below, she
cried out for Jem to come to her assistance.

Astep, which was not Jem's, came up the stairs.

Mr. Carsons stood in the door-way. In one instant he com-
prehended the case.

He raised up the powerless frame; and the departing soul
looked out of the eyes with gratitude. He held the dying man
propped in his arms, John Barton folded his hands, as if in
prayer.

“Pray for us,” said Mary, sinking on her knees, and for-
getting in that solemn hour all that had divided her father and
Mr. Carsons.

No other words would suggest themselves than some of those
he had read only a few hours before.

“God be merciful to us sinners. — Forgive us our trespasses
as we forgive them that trespass against us.”

And when the words were said, John Barton lay a corpse in
Mr. Carsons’ arms.

So ended the tragedy of a poor man’s life.

Mary knew nothing more for many minutes. When she re-
covered consciousness, she found herself supported by Jem on
the “settle” in the house-place. Job and Mr.Carsons were there,
talking together lowly and solemnly. Then Mr. Carsons bade
farewell and left the house; and Job said aloud, but as if speaking
to himeelf,

“God has heard that man’s prayer. He has comforted him.”

 

402

the consciousness of the one awful vacancy, which shall never,
while the world endures, be filled again.

‘The day brought its burden of duty to Mrs. Wilson. She felt
bound by regard, as well as by etiquette, to go and see her future
daughter-in-law. And by an old association of ideas (perhaps of
death with church-yards, and churches with Sunday), she thought.
it necessary to put on her best, and latterly unused clothes, the
airing of which on a little clothes-horse before the fire seemed to
give her a not unpleasing occupation.

When Jem returned home late in the evening succeeding John
Barton’s death, weary and oppressed with the occurrences and
excitements of the day, he found his mother busy about her
mourning, and much inclined to talk. Although he longed for
quiet, he could not avoid sitting down and answering her
questions.

“Well, Jem! he’s gone at last, ishe?”

“Yes. How did you hear, mother?”

_ “Oh, Job came over here, and telled me, on his way to the
undertaker’s. Did he make a fine end?”

It struck Jem that she had not heard of the confession which
had been made byJohn Barton on his death-bed ; he remembered
Job Legh’s discretion, and he determined that if it could be
avoided his mother should never hear of it. Many of the diffi-
culties to be anticipated in preserving the secret would be ob-
viated, if he could induce his mother to fall into the plan he had
named to Mary of emigrating to Canada. The reasons which
rendered this secrecy desirable related to the domestic happiness
he hoped for. With his mother’s irritable temper he could hardly
expect that all allusion to the crime of John Barton would be for
ever restrained from passing her lips, and he knew the deep trial
which such references would be to Mary. Accordingly he re-
solved as soon as possible in the morning to goto Job, and be-
seech his silence; he trusted that secrecy in that quarter, even if
the knowledge had been extended to Margaret, might be easily
secured.

But what would be Mr. Carson’s course? Were there any
means by which he might be persuaded to spare John Barton's
memory?

 

404

 

“Itishard,” said Jem to himself, with a bitter and indignant
feeling rising in his throat, “that let a man’s life have been what
it may, folk are so ready to credit the first word against him. I
could live it down if I stayed in England; but then what would
not Mary have to bear? Sooner or later the truth would out;
and then she would bea show to folk for many a day as John Bar-
ton’s daughter. Well! God does not judge as hardly as man,
that's one comfort for all of us!”

Mr. Duncombe did not believe in Jem’s guilt, in spite of the
silence in which he again this day heard the imputation of it; but
he agreed that under the circumstances it was better he should
leave the country.

“We have been written to by government, as I think I told
you before, to recommend an intelligent man, well acquainted
‘with mechanics, as instrument maker to the Agricultural College
they are establishing at Toronto, in Canada. It is a comfortable
appointment, — house, — land, — and a good per-centage on
the instruments made. I will show you the particulars if I can lay
my hand on the letter, which I believe I must have left at home.”

“Thank you, Sir. No need for seeing the letter to say I'll
acceptit. Imust leave Manchester; and I’d as lief quit England
at once when I’m about it.”

“Of course government give you your passage; indeed I be-
lieve an ‘allowance would be made for a family if you had one;
but you are not a married man, I believe?”

“No, Sir, but —” Jem hung back from a confession with the
awkwardness of a girl.

“But—’ said Mr. Duncombe, smiling, “you would like to
be a married man before you go, I suppose; eh, Wilson?”

“Jf you please, Sir. “And there ’s my mother, too. I hope
she'll go with us. But I can pay her passage; no need to trouble
government.”

“Nay, nay! I'll write to-day and recommend you. And say
that you have a family of two. They ‘ll never ask ifthe family
goes upwards or downwards. I shall see you again before you
sail, [hope, Wilson; though I believe they ’ll not allow you long
to wait. Come to my house next time; you ’ll find it pleasanter, I
daresay. These men are so wrong-headed. Keep up your heart!”

 

406

 

and set off on her errand of condolence. She felt nervous and
uneasy at the idea of the moral sayings and texts which she
fancied were expected from visitors on occasions like the pre-
sent; and prepared many a good set speech as she walked to-
wards the house of mourning.

‘As she gently opened the door, Mary sitting idly by the fire,
caught a glimpse of her, — of Jem’s mother, — of the early
friend of her dead parents, — of the kind minister to many a little
want in days of childhood, — and rose and came and fell about
her neck, with many a sob and moan, saying,

“Oh, he ’s gone — he’s dead — all gone — all dead, andI
am left alone!”

“Poor wench! poor, poor wench!” said Jane Wilson, tender-
ly kissing her. ‘Thou ’rt not alone, so donnot take on so. I'll
say nought of Him who ’s above, for thou knowest He is ever the
orphan’s friend; but think on Jem! nay, Mary, dear, think on
me! I’m but a frabbit woman at times, butI’vea heart within
me through all my temper, and thou shalt be as a daughter hence-
forward, — as mine own ewe-lamb. Jem shall not love thee
better in his way, than I will in mine; and thou ‘It bear with my
turns, Mary, knowing that in my soul God sees the love that
shall ever be thine, ifthou ’It take me for thy mother, and speak
no more of being alone.”

Mrs. Wilson was weeping herself long before she had ended
this speech, which was so different to all she had planned to say,
and from all the formal piety she had laid in store for the visit;
for this was heart’s-piety, and needed no garnish of texts to
make it true religion, pure and undefiled.

‘They sat together on the same chair, their arms encircling
each other; they wept for the same dead; they had the same
hope, and trust, and overflowing love in the living.

From that time forward, hardly a passing cloud dimmed the
happy confidence of their intercourse; even by Jem would his
mother’s temper sooner be irritated than by Mary; before the
latter she repressed her occasional nervous ill-humour till the
habit of indulging it was perceptibly decreased.

Years afterwards in conversation with Jem, he was startled
by a chance expression which dropped from his mother’s lips;

 

408

her, always tender and respectful, became reverential; and it
‘was more than ever a loving strife between him and Mary, which
should most contribute towards the happiness of the declining
years of their mother.

But I am speaking of the events which have occurred only
lately, while I have yet many things to tell you that happened
six or seven years ago.

CHAPTER XXXVIL.
“The rich man dines, while the poor man pines,
‘And eats bis heart away;
‘They teach us lies,” he
Would brothers do ‘Tae Darran’?

Mr. Carsons stood at one of the breathing-moments of life.
The object of the toils, the fears, and the wishes of his past
years, was suddenly hidden from his sight, — vanished into the
deep mystery which circumscribes existence. Nay, even the
vengeance which he had taken away from before his eyes, as by
the hand of God.

Events like these would have startled the most thoughtless
into reflection, much more such a man as Mr. Carsons, whose
mind, if not enlarged, was energetic; indeed, whose very
energy, having been hitherto the cause of the employment of his
powers in only one direction, had prevented him from becoming
largely and philosophically comprehensive in his views.

But now the foundations of his past life were razed to the
ground, and the place they had once occupied was sown with
salt, to be rebuilt no more for ever. It was like the change from
this Life to that other hidden one; when so many of the motives
which have actuated all our earthly existence, will have become
more fleeting than the shadows of a dream. With a wrench of
his soul from the past, so much of which was as nothing, and
worse than nothing to him now, Mr. Carsons t6ok some hours,
after he had witnessed the death of his son’s murderer, to con-
sider his situation.

But suddenly, while he was deliberating, and searching for
motives which should be effective to compel him to exertion and
action once more; while he contemplated the desire after riches,

  

 

410

“] have been calling on Mr. Bridgenorth this morning,” said
he, at last; “as I expected, he can give me but little satisfaction
on some points respecting the occurrence on the 18th of last
month, which I desire to have cleared up. Perhaps you two can
tell me what I want to know. As intimate friends of Barton’s
you probably know, or can conjecture a good deal. Have no
ecruple as to speaking the truth. What you say in this room
shall never be named again by me. Besides, you are aware that
the law allows no one to be tried twice for the same offence.””

He stopped for a minute, for the mere act of speaking was
fatiguing to him after the excitement of the last few days.

Job Legh took the opportunity of speaking.

“I’m not going to be affronted either for myself or Jem at
what you 've just now been saying about the truth. You don't
know us, and there’s an end on’t; only it’s as well for folk
to think others ‘good and true until they 're proved contrary.
Ask what you like, Sir, I'll answer for it we'll either tell truth
or hold our tongues.”

“I beg your pardon,” said Mr. Carsons, slightly bowing his
head. “What I wished to know was,” referring to a slip of paper
he held in his hand, and shaking so much he could hardly adjust
his glasses to his eyes, “whether you, Wilson, can explain how
Barton came possessed of your gun. I believe you refused this
explanation to Mr. Bridgenorth.”

“I did, Sir! IfI had said what I knew then, I saw it would
criminate Barton, and so I refused telling aught. To you, Sir,
now I will tell every thing and any thing; only it is but little.
The gun was my father’s before it was mine, and long ago he
and John Barton had a fancy for shooting at the gallery; and
they used always to take this gun, and brag that though it was
old-fashioned it was sure.”

Jem saw with self-upbraiding pain how Mr. Carsons winced at
these last words, but at each irrepressible and involuntary evi-
dence of feeling, the hearts of the two men warmed towards him.
Jem went on speaking.

“One day in the week — I think it was on the Wednesday, —
yes, it was— it was on St. Patrick’s day, I met John just coming
out of our house, as I were going to my dinner. Mother was

 

A12

 

times I was as clear of his innocence as I,was of my own; and
whenever I took to reasoning about it, I saw he could not have
been the man that didit. Still I never thought of Barton.”

“And yet by his confession he must have been absent at the
time,” said Mr. Carsons, referring to his slip of paper.

“Ay, and for many a day after, —I can’t rightly say how
long. Butstill, you see, one’s often blind to many a thing that
lies right under one’s nose, tillit’s pointed out. And till I heard
what John Barton had to say yon night, I could not have seen
what reason he had for doing it; while in the case of Jem, any
‘one who looked at Mary Barton might have seen a cause for
jealousy clear enough.”

“Then you believe that Barton had no knowledge of my
son’s unfortunate, —” he looked at Jem, “of his attentions
to Mary Barton. This young man, Wilson, has heard of them,

ou see.”
yn The person who told me, said clearly she neither had, nor
would tell Mary’s father,” interposed Jem. “I don’t believe
he'd ever heard of it; he weren't a man to keep still in such a
matter, if he had.”

“Besides,” said Job, “the reason he gave on his death-bed,
80 to speak, was enough; ‘specially to those who knew him.”

“You mean his feelings regarding the treatment of the work-
men by the masters; you think he acted from motives of revenge,
in consequence of the part my son had taken in putting down
the strike?”

“Well, Sir,” replied Job, “it’s hard to say: John Barton
was not a man to take counsel with people; nor did he make
many words about his doings. So I can only judge from his way
of thinking and talking in general, never having heard him
breathe a syllable concerning this matter in particular. You see
he were sadly put about to make great riches and great poverty
square with Christ’s Gospel” — Job paused, in order to try and
express what was clear enough in his own mind, as to the effect
produced on John Barton by the great and mocking contrasts
presented by the varieties of human condition. Before he could
find suitable words to explain his meaning, Mr. Carsons spoke.

“My good man, just listen to me. Two men live in a soli-
tude: one produces loaves of bread, the other coats, — or what
you will. Now, would it not be hard if the bread-producer were
forced to give bread for the coats, whether he wanted them or
not, in order to furnish employment to the other: that is the
simple form of the case; you've only to multiply the numbers.
There will come times of great changes in the occupation of thou-
sands, when improvements in manufactures and machinery are
made. — It’s all nonsense talking, — itmustbeso!” _

Job Legh pondered a few moments.

* It’s true it was a sore time for the hand-loom weavers when
power-looms came in: them new-fangled things make a man’s
life like a lottery; and yet I ’ll never misdoubt that power-looms,
and railways, and all such-like inventions, are the gifts of God.
Ihave lived long enough, too, to see that it is a part of His plan
to send suffering to bring out a higher good; but surely it’s also
part of His plan that so much of the burden of the suffering as can
be, should be lightened by those whom it is His pleasure to make
happy, and content in their own circumstances. Of course it
would take a deal more thought and wisdom than me, or any
other man has, to settle out of hand how this should be done.
But I’m clear about this, when God gives a blessing to be en-
joyed, He gives it with a duty to be done; and the duty of the
happy is to help the suffering to bear their woe.” )

“Still facts have proved, and are daily proving, how much
better it is for every man to be independent of help, and self-
reliant,” said Mr. Carsons, thoughtfully.

“ You can never work facts as you would fixed quantities, and
say, given two facts, and the product is so and so. God has given
men feelings and passions which cannot be worked into the
problem, because they are for ever changing and uncertain. God
has also made some weak; not in any one way, but in all. One is
weak in body, another in mind, another in steadiness of purpose,
a fourth can’t tell right from wrong, and so on; or if he can tell the
right, he wants strength to hold by it. Now to my thinking, them
that is strong in any of God's gifts, is meant to help the weak, —
be hanged to the facts! Iask your pardon, Sir; I can't rightly ex-
plain the meaning that isin me. I’m like a tap as won’trun, but

 

 

 

416

say, “Poor fellows, our hearts are sore for ye; we’ve done all
we could, and can’t find a cure,’ — we'd bear up like men
through bad times. No one knows till they have tried, what
power of bearing lies in them, if once they believe that men are
caring for their sorrows and will help if they can. If fellow-
creatures can give nought but tears, and brave words, we take
our trials straight from God, and we know enough of His love
to put ourselves blind into his hands. You say, our talk has
done no good. I say it has. I see the view you take of things
from the place where you stand. I can remember that, when
the time comes for judging you, Isha’n't think any longer, does
he act right on my views of a thing, but does he act right on his
own. It has done me good in that way. I’m an oldman, and
may never see you again; but I'll pray for you, and think on
you and your trials, both of your great wealth, and of your con’s
cruel death, many and many a day to come; andI’ll ask God to
bless both to you now and forevermore. Amen. Farewell!

Jem had maintained a manly and dignified reserve ever since
he had made his open statement of all he knew. Now both the
men rose, and bowed low, looking at Mr. Carsons with the deep
human interest they could not fail to take in one who had en-
dured and forgiven a deep injury; and who struggled hard, as it
was evident he did, to bear up like a man under his affliction.

He bowed low in return to them. Then he suddenly came
forward and shook them by the hand; and thus, without a word
more, they parted.

‘There are stages in the contemplation and endurance of great
sorrow, which endow men with the same earnestness and clear-
ness of thought that in some of old took the form of Prophecy.
To those who have large capability of loving and suffering,
united with great power of firm endurance, there comes a time
in their woe, when they are lifted out of the contemplation of
their individual case into a searching inquiry into the nature
of their calamity, and the remedy (if remedy there be) which
may prevent its recurrence to others as well as to themselves.

Hence the beautiful, noble efforts which are from time to
time brought to light, as being continuously made by those who
have once hung on the cross of agony, in order that others may

CHAPTER XXXVIII.
“Touch us gently, gentle Time!
‘We 've not proud or soaring wings,
Our ambition, our content,
Lies in simple things ;
Humble voyagers are we
Orer life's dim unsounded sea;
Touch us gently, gentle Time!”
Barry Conx watt.

Nor many days after John Barton’s funeral was over, all was
arranged respecting Jem’s appointment at Toronto; and the
time was fixed for his sailing. It wasto take place almost imme-
diately: yet much remained to be done; many domestic prepa-
rations were to bemade; and one great obstacle, anticipated by
both Jem and Mary, to be removed. This was the opposition
they expected from Mrs. Wilson, to whom the plan had never yet
been named.

They were most anxious that their home should continue ever
to be hers, yet they feared that her dislike to a new country
might be an insuperable objection to this. At last Jem took ad-
vantage of an evening of unusual placidity, as he sat alone with
his mother just before going to bed, to broach the subject; and
to his surprise she acceded willingly to his proposition of her ac-
companying himself and his wife.

“To be sure Merrica is a long way to flit to; beyond Lon-
don a good bit I reckon; and quite in foreign parts; but I’ve
never had no opinion of England, ever since they could be such
fools as to take up a quiet chap like thee, and clap thee in prison.
Where you go, I'll go. Perhaps in them Indian countries they'll
know a well-behaved lad when they see him; ne’er speak a word
more lad, I'll go.”

Their path became daily more smooth, and easy; the present
was clear and practicable, the future was hopeful; they had lei-
sure of mind enough to turn to the past.

“Jem!” said Mary to him, one evening as they sat in the
twilight, talking together in low happy voices till Margaret should
come to keep Mary company through the night, ‘Jem! you’ve
never yet told me how you came to know about my naughty

 

420

refused, and said she could not break off her drinking ways,
come what might.”

“You never will persuade her if you fear and doubt,” said
Mary, in tears. “Hope yourself, and trust to the good that
must beinher. Speak to that, — she has it in her yet, — ob,
bring her home, and we will love her so, we ‘ll make her good.”

“Yes!” said Jem, catching Mary's singuine spirit; “she
shall go to America with us; and we ‘ll help her to get rid of her
sins. I'll go now, my precious darling, and if I can’t find her,
it 's but trying the police to-morrow. ‘Take care of your own
sweet self, Mary,” said he, fondly kissing her before he went
out.

It was notto be. Jem wandered far and wide that night, but
never met Esther. The next day he applied to the police; and
at last they recognised under his description of her, a woman
known to them under the name of the “Butterfly,” from the
gaicty of her dress a year or two ago. By their help he traced
out one of their haunts, a low lodging-house behind Peter Street.
He and his companion, a kind-hearted policeman, were ad-
mitted, suspiciously enough, by the landlady, who ushered
them into a large garret where twenty or thirty people of all ages
and both sexes lay and dozed away the day, choosing the even-
ing and night for their trades of beggary, thieving, or prostitu-
tion.

“I know the butterfly was here,” said she, looking round.
“She came in, the night before last, and said she had not 6
penny to get a place for shelter; and that if she was far away in
the country she could steal aside and die ina copse, or a clough,
like the wild animals; but here the police would let no one alone
in the streets, and she wanted a spot to die in, in peace. It’sa
queer sort of peace we have here, but that night the room was
uncommon empty, andI'’m not a hard-hearted woman (I wish I
were, I could ha’ made a’ good thing out of itafore this if were
harder), so I sent her up, — but she ’s not here now, I think.”

“Was she very bad?”’ asked Jem.

“Ay! nought but skin and bone, with cough to tear her in
two.”

‘They made some inquiries, and found that in the restlessness


422

laid her on Mary’s bed, not daring to undress her, lest any
motion should frighten the trembling life away; but it was all in
vain.

Towards midnight, she opened wide her eyes and looked
around on the once familiar room: Job Legh knelt by the bed,
praying aloud and fervently for her, but he stopped as he saw her
roused look. She sat up in bed with a sudden convulsive motion.

“Has it been a dream, then?” asked she, wildly. Then with
ababit, which came like instinct even in that awful dying hour,
her hand sought for a locket which hung concealed in her bosom,
and, finding that, she knew all was true which bad befallen her
since last she lay an innocent girl on that bed.

She fell back, and spoke word never more. She held the
locket containing her child’s hair still in her hand, and once or
twice she kissed it with a long soft kiss. She cried fecbly and
sadly as long as she had any strength to cry, and then she died.

‘They laid her in one grave with John Barton. And there they
lie without name, or initial, or date. Only this verse is inscribed
upon the stone which covers the remains of these two wanderers.

Pealm cili. v. 9. — “For he will not always chide, neither will
he keep his anger for ever.”

   

I see a long low wooden house, with room enough, and to
spare. The old primeval trees are felled and gone for many a
mile around; one alone remains to over-shadow the gable-end
of the cottage. ‘There is a garden around the dwelling, and far
beyond that stretches an orchard. The glory of an Indian
summer is over all, making the heart leap at the sight of its
gorgeous beauty.

‘At the door of the house, looking towards the town, stands
Mary, watching for the return of her husband from his daily
work; and while she watches, she listens, smiling;

“Clap hands, daddy comes,
With bis pocket full of plums,
And a cake for Johnnie.”

‘Then comes a crow of delight from Johnnie. Then his grand-
mother carries him to the door, and glories in seeing him resist
his mother’s blandishments to cling to her.

“English letters! "T was that made me so late!”

“Oh, Jem, Jem! don’t hold them so ‘tight! What do
they say?”

“Why, some goods news. Come, give a guess what it is?”

“Oh, tell me! I cannot guess,” said Mary.

“Then you give it up, do you? What do you say, mother?”

Jane Wilson thought » moment.

“Will and Margaret are married?” asked she.

“Not exactly,— but very near. The old woman has twice the
spirit of the young one. Come, Mary, give a guess!””

He covered his little boy’s eyes with his hands for an instant,
significantly, till the baby pushed them down, saying in his im-
perfect way,

“Tan’t see.”

“There now! Johnnie can see. Do you guess, Mary?”

“They ’ve done something to Margaret to give her back her
sight!” exclaimed she.

“They have. She has been couched, and can see as well as
ever. She and Will are to be married on the twenty-fifth of this
month, and he’s bringing her out here next voyage; and Job
Legh talks of coming too, — not to see you, Mary, — nor you,
mother, — nor you, my little hero” (kissing him), “but to try and
pick up a few specimens of Canadian insects, Will says. All the
compliment is to the earwigs, you see, mother!”

“Dear Job Legh!” said Mary, softly and seriously.
