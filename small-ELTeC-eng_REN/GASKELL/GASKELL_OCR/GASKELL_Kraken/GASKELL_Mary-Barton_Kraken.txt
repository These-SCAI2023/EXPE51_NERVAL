 are some fields near ancehester, well known to
the inhabitants as ``Freen Heys Fields,'' through which rans
s publie footpath to s little vilasge about to miles distant. In
spite of these fields being flat, and low, nsy, in spite of th
want of waod (the great and usual recommendation of leal
tracts of land), there is s charm about them which strikes even
the inhabitant of a mountinous district, who zees and feels
the effact of contrsst in these commaon-place but thoroughly
rural fields, with the bsy, bustling manufacturing town, he
1eft but half an hour ago. Her ad there an old blacek and
white frm-house, with its rambling outbuildings, pesks of
other tims and other ocecupations than those which no
absorb the population of the mneighbourhood. Iere in their

engines, my come to listen awhile to the de-





















s
ho thinks he and ha fellows are the real makers of this
wealth, is strnggling on for bread for his children, through
the licissitudes of lowered wages, short honrs fewer hands
emloyed, &c. And when he knows trade is bad, and conld
understanl (t lenst partially) thnt there are not buyers
enogh in the market to purchase ths goods already made,
nnd Consequently that there is no demand for more; when
he would bear and endure much without complaining, could
he also see thast his emnployers were bearing their share; he is,
I say, bawillered and (to use his awn word) ``agraated''
to sae thst all goes on just as msual with the nill-owners.
Lrge houses nre still oecupied, while spinners' and weavers
cottuages stand empty, because the families that onee fllled
them are obligel to live in rooms or callars. Carriages still
roll nlong the streets, concerta are still crowded hy suh-
eribers, the shops for expensive luxuries still find iaily
customers, while the workaan loiters away his unemloyed
time in watehing these things, and thinking of the pnale, nn-
complining wife at home, and the wailing children asking in
vsin for enough of foo, of the sinking ealth, of the dying
lifa of thosae near and denr to him. The contrastis too great.
Why should he alone sufter from bad times?
I know that this is not really the case; and I know what is 
the truth in sueh matters: but what I wish to impress is what]
the workman feels and thinks. True, that with child-lik
improvidence, ood times will often dissipate his grumbling,
anl make him foret all prudence and foresight.
But thero aro earest men mng e eolc, men rh

forgetting or forgiviag those whom (they beliave) have eausetl
all this woe.

his hair with old country hbit, and every naw and then stesl-

thast she felt little acceorded with the sewing on which she wass
engaged.
Bo when the funeral sy cme, Mrs. Davenport was neatly
arrayel in black, a satisfaction to her poor heart in the midst
ofhersorro. Barton and WiIlson both accompanied her, as
she led her two elder boys, and followed the coffin. It wans
simnle walkin funeral, with nothing to grate on thoe feeling
of any; far more in aecordance with its purpose, to my mind,
than the gorgeous hearses, and nodding plmes, which form
the groetesque funeral pomp of respectable people. here
was no '`rattling the bones over the stones,'' of the paupers
funeral. Decently and quietly was he followed to the grave
by one etermined to endure her woe meekly for his sake.
The only mark of psuperism attendant on the burial con-
csrnod tha living and joyons, far more than the ded, or the
zorrowful. When they arrived in the churchyard, they halted
befor a raised and handsome tombsetone; in reality a wootaen
mockery of stone rerpectabilities which adorned the burial-
groun. It was esily rsisel in a very few minutes, and below
was the grave in which panper bodies were piled until within
n foot or two of the surfaca; when the soil was zhoslled over
nnd stamed down, and the aoden cover went to do tempo-
rary duty over another hole.' But litle they recked of this
who no gae up their dead.

eWell, give it me,'' said Mary, impatiently, and anxious in
her present mood for her visitor's departure.
Sally relinquished it unwillingly. She had, however,
the pleasure of secing Mary dimple and blush as she read
the letter, which seemed to asasy the wter was not indifferent
to her.
You must toll him I can't come,'' said Mary, raising
her eyes at last. `I have said I won't mect him while fathen

But Mary, he does so look for you. You ' be quite
sorry for him, he 's so put out aboutnot soeing you. Resides,

to that.''

And in an instant Mlargaret was in the room. Mary had
begged Job Legh to let her come and sleep with her. In the
uneertain fire-light you could not help noticing that she had
the groping walk of a blind person.

hlf the feeling she put into it that night, the lecturer must
have heen hard to please, if he did not admit that his ex-

When it was ended, Mary's looks told more than words
could have done what she thought of it; and partly to keep
in a tear which would fain have rolled out, she brightened into
 laugh, and snid, `for certain, th' carriage is coming. So

the people were wet and dirty. Indeed, most kept within
doors; and there as an unutual silenee of footstens in the
littie paved courts.

But Mary would not let him so rest. he ran un and brougght
down his working-day clothes, and went into the pantry to
rumtnsge up their litle bit of nrovision while he changed by
the fire, talking all the while as gily as she conld, though
her father'a epression hung like lel on her heart.
kFor Mary, in her scclusion at Miss Simmonds',- where
the chief talk was of fashions, and uress, and parties to be
given, for which such and such gowns srould he wanted,

Yon may think I am a fool; but I did think yo meant ta

And with a wrench for whieh she had reserved all ler
strength, she lew off like a holt. They heari her flying foot-
nteps echo down the quiet street. The next sound was Sully's
laugh, which grated on Mr. Caroens' ears, and keenly irri
tated him.

Oh, Sir, I beg yeur parlon. I humbly beg your purdon,

Sally was silent, so he went on:

reminded Sally, rather maliciously.

and moans and erie its little heart out, yet does nouht to help.
I think my sense hs let me all at onee, and I can't even find
trength to ery lika tha little ehild.''
Hereupon she broks into a taeble wil of aelt-repronch, that
her outwrd shnw of misery was not grenler; as if any cries, or
tenrs, or loud-spoken words ceould have told of such pangs at
the heasrt as that look, and that thin, piping, alterel voieel
But think of Miary and what she was enduringl Picture to
youralf (for I cnnnot tell you) the armies of thoughts that met
and clashel in her brain; and then imagine the effort it cost her
to be cslm, and quiet, and even in a faint wsy, cheerful and
smiling at tines.
After a while she begnn to stir about in her own mind for aome
menns of spnring thse poor mother the trial of appearing as a
witnaess in the mtter of the gun. She had mae no allusion ta
haer summons this morning, and Mary almost thought she must
have forgotten it; anl surely some means might he found to
nravaent that aditional sorro. Bha must seeloh about it: nasy,
if necessary, shs must sse Me, Iridgenorth, with all his truth-
compalling powers; for, indeel, she had so struggled and
triumphod (though s sadly-bleeding victor at henrt) over hoerself
thess two last lsys, hal ao coneealed agony, an hidden her
inward waoo anl bewilerment, that she hegan o tke con-
fitdenee, and to have faith in her own powers of meetingany one
with a pnssably fair show, whatever might be rending her lifa
beneath the cloak of her deeeption.
Accordingly, ns soon as Mrs. Davanport came in after morn-
intg church, to ask after tha two lone women, nn she hnd henrd
thae reort Miary hm t ive (o mueh beiter as regarded Mrs.
Wilson thnn what they h fenre the night befora it would hava
hbeon) -s soon as this kind-heartel, grateful woman cme in,
Mary, telling her her puroese, went off to fetch the doctor wh
ntended Alice.
He was shking himself after his morning's round, and happy
in the nnticipntion of his unsy's dinner; but he wns a good-
tempered mnn, who found it difficult to keep w i w
ensiness een by the bed of sicknes or death. eA im-

oh spoke, and Ms. Wilson answered.
So guietly that it was unnataral under the circumstanees. It
me  deeper impression on the old mn than any token of mere
bodily illness could hare done. If she lad raved in delirium, or
moanl in faver, he eould hae spren after his wont, and given
his opinion, his advice and his consolation; now he was awed intd
ilanca.
At length he pulled Mary aside inte s cnrner of the house-
place where Mrs. Wilson wss sitting, and began to talk to her.
Yo 'ra rigght, MnryI She 'a no ways fit to go to Liverpool,
poor sonl. Now I 'va seen her I only wonder the doctor conld
ha' been nnsettled in his mind ast th' firat. Choose how it goes
wi' poor em, she eannotgo. One way or another it will soaon be
over, the best to leve her in the stte she is till then,''
tI was sure you would think so,'' aaid Mnry.
But they ware reckonin without their host. They esteemed
har senses ggone, while in fict, they were only inert, and conld
not convey impressions rampidly to the over-burdened, troubhled
brsin. Thay had not notieed tht her eyes had followed them
(mechanically it seemed at first) ns they had moved away to thse
orner of the room; that her fce hitherto so chanreless, hd
barun to work with one or two of the aold symptoms of im-
patianes.
But when they were silent she stool u, and starlled them
almost as if a dead person had spoken, by saying clenrly anl
ecidedly --lI go t Liveraaol. I hear you and your plans; and
I tell you I shall gn to Liverpaol. If my words are to kill my son,
they have alreamdy gone forth out of my mouth, anl nought cnn

When all are hating him, he shnll have his poor mother near him,

those aroumnd her.

seat, her hand holding baek the curtain which shaded the room
from the hright msonlight withont; her head restiag its weariness
against the corner of the windo-frame; her eyes bhurning, and
stiff with the intensity of her z.

O ll the restless people who found that niht's hors agoni

was perhaps ths most restless. He hsl slept bmt little sinee the

uiet slumbers.

Iob Iegh, RBen Sturgis, and several others were there, amongst
whom was Charle Jones.
Job Legh had carefully avoided any questioning from Mrs.
Wilson that morning. Indeed he had not been much in her com-
pany, for he had risen up early to go out once more to make in-
quiry for MIary; and when he could hear nothing of her, he had
desperately resolved not to undeceive Mre. Wilson, ass sorro
never came too late; and if the blow were inevitable, it would

with a strange wonder in her brsin, ass the reality of the terrible
circnstances in which slte was place.
Sulenly she was rousetd, sho kne not how or by what.
Bhe was conscious that all was real, that hundrede waere looking
t hor, that true-sounding words were beingg extracted fraom her;
that that tigure, so bowel down, wih the faee concealed with
both hands, was really Jem. IIer fuce flashed scarlet, anl
then, paler than before. Ilut in dresd of herself, with the
tremoendous secret imprisone within her, she exerted eer
powaer she had to keep in the full understantting of what s

But, in that instant, sho aw the hands removed from a fc

sudenly her resolution wus taskon. The present was every

umpon; butnewe she might own her fault, butnow she might een
own her love. No, when the beloved stood ths, abhorred
of men, thero would be no feminine shame to stand hetween her
and her avowal. So she also turnel towards the judge, partls
to mark that her answcr was not gien to ths monkeyfid man
who questioned her, and likewise that her face might be avertel
from, and her eyes not gze upon, the form that contractod with

out they should not like to work unler me again; thlere were
some few who knew me well enough to feel I could not have done
it, but more were doubtful; nnl one spoke to young Mr. un
combe, hinting at what they thought.''
eOh, Jeml what a shamel'' snid Mury, with mournful in-
dignation.
eNay, darlingl I 'm not for blaming them. Poor fellows like
them have nought to stanl upon and be proud of but their ch-
racter, and its fitting they should take cnre of that, and keep tlat
fee from soil and tint.''
But you, - what could they get butgood from you? They
might have known you by this time.''
o some do; the overlooker, I 'm snre, would kno I 'm in-
nocent. Indeed, he said as mueh to-day:; and he said he had had
some talk with old Mr. Duneombe, and they thought it might be
better if I left Manchester for a bit; they 'd recommend me ts
some other place.''
But Mary could only shake her hend in a mournful wasy, and
Tpeat her words,
They might have known thee better, Jem.''

em nresed the littia hand he held hetween his awn work-

`"Ay, larl Trnai me, 1 'Il never ask thee to lesve Manchester

Not righly - notnow, at any rate;- bnt with thee, Jem,''
her voice sunk to s soft, low whiaper, ''anywhere --''
Wht was the use of a geegraplical lescription.

ilenee with the one sharp liarorl in her present life,
he looked n at her lover's gravo fce; and then the messsg

Oh, Jem, i I tell you? -- Father aent word he wisho to

Wht n he want, Je'
I cannot tell,'' repliel he. `At any rate I 'llo. It 's no use
troubling ourselves to uess,'' he continuel, after a pause fora
few minutes, during which they slowly nnl silently naced up and
down the hy-street, into which he h lel her when heir conen-
atlion hegan. '`Come anl see mother, anl then I 'll take thee
home, Mnry. Thon wert ull in s lremblae when first I came un t

Her fthar was standing behid his habitanl chair; holding hy

Mr. Cursons; ths ilark out-line of his stern figure looming isrge
aAgainst the light of the fire in that litle raom.
Behind her fther sat Iob Legh, his head in his hands, and
resting his elbows on the litle fmily table,-listening evidently;
but as avidantly daeply alffaetd by wht he heard.
The amel to ba soms pause in the cunvarsation. Mary
nnd Jem atood at the hslf-opea door, not daring to stir; hardly
tn braaihe.

his daep uivering oiea. Man1 have lI henrl you ariht'' Wa

last few words almost as if pealing for pity, and then hae
changed his tone to one mnrs vehemnent and fiarce.) `IDont dare

"Ak, or not ask, what care 17 You shall be haned-

John hBarton gaspe; but not with fenr. Itw only thnt ha
felt it terriblo to have inspirel such haired, as was coneenlrataed
into every word, avery geslure of e, Cnrsons.
`'As fr being hanged, Sir, I know it's ll riht nnd nroper.

fromn excests of emotion
Then he begaen agin.
`Sin' that day (it may be very wicked, Sir, but it 's the
truth) I 've kept thinking and thinking if I were but in that world
whera they say God is, He wonld, may be, tench me right
from wrong, even if it were with many strines. I 've heen sore
puzzled here. I would go through Hell-fire if I coull bhut get
free from sin at last, it's such an awful thing. As for hanging
that's jest nought at all.''
His exhasustion comelled him to sit down. Mary rushed to
him. It seemed as if till then he had been unaware of her
presence.
''Ay, ay, wenchl'' said he, feebly, ``is it thee Where's

break, and gasping panse,
Lndl thou hnst borne a deal for me. It 'a the meanesl

wert as innocent of any knowledge of it as the babe unborn.
I II not bless thee for it. Blessing from such as me would not
bring thee any good. Thou 'lt love Miary, though she is my
aild,''
He ceased, and there wns a pause for a few seconds.
Then Mr. Carsons turned to go. When his hand was on the
lateh of the door, he hesitated for an instant.
You can have no doubt for what parposel go. Straight to
the police-offtice, to asend men to take care of you, wretched
man, and your aecomplice. To-morrow morning your tale hall
he repeated to those who can commit you to gaol, and before
long you ehall have the opportunity of trying how desirahle
hanging is.''
Oh, Sirl'' said Mary, springing forward, and catchiag
39
hold of Mr. Casons' arm, ``my father is dying. Look at him,
Sir. If you want Death for Deth, you have it. Don't tak
him away from me these inst hamrs. He must go alone through
Death, but let me he with him as long as I can. Oh, Sir1 ifyonu

John himself stood up, astif and riggit, and repliel,
 Mnry, wenchl I owe him snmit. I will go dis, where,
and ns he wishes me. Thou hast said true, I am standing sida

Mr. Cnrsons took his hanls awy from his faca. I would

Tharae are blasphemous actions as well as blasphemous

They litel him up, nol almnst hoping that that deep tranee

Faor n time they listenad with diviled attention to his faint
brethings; for in enceh hssty hrried ston thst echaed in the
street outside,. they teught they hennd the approach of the
ofiesrs of justice.
W'hen Mr. Cursons left tha house he was dizsy with agitation;
the hot bloasl went enreerin through his frame. e could not
zee the daap blus of the night-henvens for the fierce ulses which
throbbel in his head. Amd psrtly to steady and clm himself,
he lenned aginat a riling, and lonked p int thoss calm

FLet my traspnsses be nnforgivnn, so that I may have ven-

He tried to shake off the spirittal impression mnde by this
imasgination. He ws feverish and ill,- and no wonler.
o he turne to go honewarde; not, ass he had threatened,
to the poliee-office. After all (he toll himself), that would lo
in the morning. No fear of the mn's escaping, unless he
escpe to the Graa,
Bo he tried to banish the phantom voices and shaes which
came unbillen to his brin, and 1o recall his balanee of minl by
wnlking calmly and sloly, nmnd noticing every thing which
ztruck his senses.
It was a warm soft evening in spring, and there weere many
persons in the streets. Among others, a nurse with a little girl
in her charge, conveying her home from some chillren's gaiety;
n ance most likely, for the looly liule creatura was laintily
decked out in soft, snowy muslin; and her firy feet tripped
nlong by her nurse's side, ns if to the measure of some tune she
hal lately kept time to.
Sudlenly up behind her there cnme n rough, rude errand-
boy, nine or ten years of age; n giant he looked by the fairy-
chill, as she fluttered along. I don't know how it wns, but in
some nwkward way he knocked the noor little girl lown unon
the hnrd pavement as he brushed ruely past, not much caring
whom he hurt, so that he got along.
The child nrose sobhbing with palin; nd not withont case,
for bloo ws droppingg down from the fice, but a minute bofore
so fuir an bright - iropping down on the pretty frock, making
those scnrlet marks so terible to lile ehildren.
The nrse, n powerful woman, hd seizel the boy, just as
Mr. Crsons (who hd seen the whole trnnsaetion) came up.
You nnuhty little rascnlI I 'II ive you to a policeman,
that I wiIll DDo you see how you 've hurt the little girl Do

sionnte anger.
The ial looked hard, and defying; bnt withal terrified at the
threat of the policeman, those ogres of onr streets to all unlueky

rchins. The nnrse sw it, and hegan to dra him along, witha
view ofmkin what she called '`n wholesome impression.''
His tarrar ineresed, anl with it his irritalion; when the little
weet face, choking awny its sobs, pulled dawn nurse's head,
nd aid,
ePlense, dear nnre, I 'm not much hurt:; it was vary silly to
crY, you knao. He did not mean o do it. Ile did not hore ulal

kissed hy her injurer, just as she had been tught to lo at home
to ``make neace.''

I IIbe bound, thnnks ta thntliutle Iady,'' anid s pnsser-by, half
to himself, and half to r. Carsons, whom ha had observed ta
nOtice the acen.
Tho lnttar took no npparent heed of the remnrk, hut pnssed
