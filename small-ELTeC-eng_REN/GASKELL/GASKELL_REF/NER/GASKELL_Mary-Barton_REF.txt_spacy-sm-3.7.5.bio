     | O
fond O
admiration O

work O

my O
story O
in O
some O

already O

little O
progress O

the O
place O

when O
I O
bethought O
me O
how O
deep O

     | O
might O
be O
the O
romance O
in O
the O
lives O
of O
some O
of O
those O
who O
elbowed O
me O
daily B-DATE
in O
the O
busy O
streets O
of O

     | O
the O
town O
in O
which O
I O
resided O

I O
had O
always O
felt O
a O
deep O
sympathy O
with O
the O
care O
- O
worn O
men O
, O
who O
|
     | O
looked O
as O
if O
doomed O
to O
struggle O
through O
their O
lives O
in O
strange O
alternations O
between O
work O
and O
|
     | O
want O
  O
tossed O
to O

fro O

even O
a O
greater O
degree O
than O
other O
men O

A O

     | O
little O
manifestation O
of O
this O
sympathy O
, O
and O
a O
little O
attention O
to O
the O
expression O
of O
feelings O
on O
|
     | O
the O
part O
of O
some O
of O
the O
work O
- O
people O
with O
whom O
I O
was O
acquainted O
, O
had O
laid O
open O
to O
me O
the O
hearts O
|
     | O
of O
one B-CARDINAL
or O
two B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
more O
thoughtful O
among O
them O
  O
I O
saw O
that O
they O
were O
sore O
and O
irritable O
|
     | O
against O
the O
rich O
, O
the O
even O
tenor O
of O
whose O
seemingly O
happy O
lives O
appeared O
to O
increase O
the O
|
     | O
anguish O
caused O
by O
the O
lottery O

like O
nature O
of O

Whether O
the O
bitter O
complaints O
made O
by O

     | O
them O

neglect O

they O
experienced O
from O
the O
prosperous O

from O
the O
masters O

fortunes O

not O

is O
enough O
to O
say O
, O
that O
this O
belief O

the O
injustice O

unkindness O
which O
they O
endure O
from O

common O

the O
employers O

the O
employed O
must O
ever O
be O
, O
the O
more O
anxious O
I O
became O
to O
|
     | O
give O
some O
utterance O
to O
the O
agony O
which O
, O
from O
time O
to O
time O
, O
convulses O
this O
dumb O
people O
  O
the O
|
     | O
agony O
of O
suffering O
without O
the O
sympathy O
of O
the O
happy O
, O
or O
of O
erroneously O
believing O
that O
such O
is O

     | O
the O

it O

which O
come O

ever O

it O

is O
at O

the O
round O

The O
softness O
of O
the B-DATE

tempted O
forth O
the O
young O
green O

, O
which O
almost O
visibly O

     | O
fluttered O
into O

with O
the O

Groups B-GPE

whose O
ages O
might O
range O
from O
twelve B-CARDINAL

     | O
twenty B-CARDINAL

came O
by O
with O
a O
buoyant O
step O

They O
were O
most O
of O

factory O

wore O
the O

out O

of O

dress O
of O
that O
particular O

a O

which O
at O
mid B-DATE

or O
in O

     | O

towards O
evening B-TIME
, O
or O
if O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
were O
chilly O
, O
|
     | O
became O
a O
sort O
of O
Spanish B-NORP
mantilla O
or O
Scotch B-NORP
plaid O
, O
and O
was O
brought O
over O
the O
head O
and O
hung O
|
     | O
loosely O
down O
, O
or O
was O
pinned O
under O
the O
chin O
in O
no O
unpicturesque O
fashion O
. O
| 
  | O
Their O
faces O
were O
not O
remarkable O
for O
beauty O
  O
indeed O
, O
they O
were O
below O
the O
average O
, O
with O
one B-CARDINAL
or O
|
     | O
two B-CARDINAL
exceptions O
  O
they O
had O
dark O
hair O
, O
neatly O
and O
classically O
arranged O
, O
dark O
eyes O
, O
but O
sallow O
|
     | O
complexions O
and O
irregular O
features O
. O
The O
only O
thing O
to O
strike O
a O
passer O
- O
by O
was O
an O
acuteness O
and O
|
     | O
intelligence O
of O
countenance O
, O
which O
has O
often O
been O
noticed O
in O
a O
manufacturing O
population O
. O
| 
  | O
There O
were O
also O
numbers O
of O
boys O
, O
or O
rather O
young O
men O
, O
rambling O
among O
these O
fields O
, O
ready O
to O
|
     | O
bandy O
jokes O
with O
any O
one O
, O
and O
particularly O
ready O
to O
enter O
into O
conversation O
with O
the O
girls O
, O
|
     | O
who O
, O
however O
, O
held O
themselves O
aloof O
, O
not O
in O
a O
shy O
, O
but O
rather O
in O
an O
independent O
way O
, O
assuming O
|
     | O
an O
indifferent O
manner O
to O
the O
noisy O
wit O
or O
obstreperous O
compliments O
of O
the O
lads O
. O
Here O
and O
there O
|
     | O
came O
a O
sober O
quiet O
couple O
, O
either O
whispering O
lovers O
, O
or O
husband O
and O
wife O
, O
as O
the O
case O
might O
be O
  O
|
     | O
and O
if O
the O
latter O
, O
they O
were O
seldom O
unencumbered O
by O
an O
infant O
, O
carried O
for O
the O
most O
part O
by O
the O
|
     | O
father O
, O
while O
occasionally O
even O
three B-CARDINAL
or O
four O
little O
toddlers O
had O
been O
carried O
or O
dragged O
thus O
|
     | O
far O
, O
in O
order O
that O
the O
whole O
family O
might O
enjoy O
the O
delicious O
May B-TIME
afternoon I-TIME
together O
. O
| 
  | O
Sometime O
in O
the O
course O
of O
that B-TIME
afternoon I-TIME
, O
two B-CARDINAL
working O
men O
met O
with O
friendly O
greeting O
at O
the O
|
     | O
stile O
so O
often O
named O
. O
One B-CARDINAL
was O
a O
thorough O
specimen O
of O
a O
Manchester B-ORG
man O
  O
born O
of O
factory O
workers O
, O
|
     | O
and O
himself O
bred O
up O
in O
youth O
, O
and O
living O
in O
manhood O
, O
among O
the O
mills O
. O
He O
was O
below O
the O
middle O
|
     | O
size O
and O
slightly O
made O
  O
there O
was O
almost O
a O
stunted O
look O
about O
him O
  O
and O
his O
wan O
, O
colourless O
face O
|
     | O
gave O
you O
the O
idea O
, O
that O
in O
his O
childhood O
he O
had O
suffered O
from O
the O
scanty O
living O
consequent O
upon O
|
     | O
bad O
times O
and O
improvident O
habits O
. O
His O
features O
were O
strongly O
marked O
, O
though O
not O
irregular O
, O
and O
|
     | O
their O
expression O
was O
extreme O
earnestness O
  O
resolute O
either O
for O
good O
or O
evil O
  O
a O
sort O
of O
latent O
, O
|
     | O
stern O
enthusiasm O
. O
At O
the O
time O
of O
which O
I O
write O
, O
the O
good O
predominated O
over O
the O
bad O
in O
the O
|
     | O
countenance O
, O
and O
he O
was O
one O
from O
whom O
a O
stranger O
would O
have O
asked O
a O
favour O
with O
tolerable O
faith O
|
     | O
that O
it O
would O
be O
granted O
. O
He O
was O
accompanied O
by O
his O
wife O
, O
who O
might O
, O
without O
exaggeration O
, O
have O
|
     | O
been O
called O
a O
lovely O
woman O
, O
although O
now O
her O
face O
was O
swollen O
with O
crying O
, O
and O
often O
hidden O
|
     | O
behind O
her O
apron O
. O
She O
had O
the O
fresh O
beauty O
of O
the O
agricultural O
districts O
  O
and O
somewhat O
of O
the O
|
     | O
deficiency O
of O
sense O
in O
her O
countenance O
, O
which O
is O
likewise O
characteristic O
of O
the O
rural O
|
     | O
inhabitants O
in O
comparison O
with O
the O
natives O
of O
the O
manufacturing O
towns O
. O
She O
was O
far O
advanced O
in O
|
     | O
pregnancy O
, O
which O
perhaps O
occasioned O
the O
overpowering O
and O
hysterical O
nature O
of O
her O
grief O
. O
The O
|
     | O
friend O
whom O
they O
met O
was O
more O
handsome O
and O
less O
sensible O
- O
looking O
than O
the O
man O
I O
have O
just O
|
     | O
described O
  O
he O
seemed O
hearty O
and O
hopeful O
, O
and O
although O
his O
age O
was O
greater O
, O
yet O
there O
was O
far O
|
     | O
more O
of O
youth O
's O
buoyancy O
in O
his O
appearance O
. O
He O
was O
tenderly O
carrying O
a O
baby O
in O
arms O
, O
while O
his O
|
     | O
wife O
, O
a O
delicate O
, O
fragile O
- O
looking O
woman O
, O
limping O
in O
her O
gait O
, O
bore O
another O
of O
the O
same O
age O
  O
|
     | O
little O
, O
feeble O
twins O
, O
inheriting O
the O
frail O
appearance O
of O
their O
mother O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
last O
- O
mentioned O
man O
was O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
to O
speak O
, O
while O
a O
sudden O
look O
of O
sympathy O
dimmed O
his O
|
     | O
gladsome O
face O
. O
" O

, O
in O
a O

" O

Meanwhile O
the O

greeted O
each O
other O
like O
old O
friends O

the O
soft O
and O

     | O
plaintive O
voice O
of O
the O
mother O
of O

to O

up O

  | O
" O
Well O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O

I O
have O
thought O
several O
times O
since O
, O
that O
she O
was O
a O
bit O
quieter O
, O
and O
more O

     | O
womanly O
- O
like O
  O
more O
gentle O

more O
blushing O

not O
so O
riotous O

noisy O

She O
comes O
in O
, O

     | O
toward O
four B-TIME

when O
afternoon B-TIME

was O

she O
goes O

hangs O
her O
bonnet O
up O
on O

     | O
the O
old O
nail O
we O
used O
to O
call O
hers O
, O
while O
she O
lived O
with O
us O

I O
remember O
thinking O
what O
a O
pretty O

     | O
lass O
she O
was O
, O
as O
she O
sat O
on O
a O
low O
stool O
by O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
rocking O
herself O
, O
and O
in O
rather O
a O
poor O

     | O
way O
. O
She O
laughed O
and O
cried O
by O
turns O
, O
but O
all O
so O
softly O
and O
gently O
, O
like O
a O
child O
, O
that O
I O
|
     | O
could O
n't O
find O
in O
my O
heart O
to O
scold O
her O
, O
especially O
as O
Mary B-PERSON
was O
fretting O
already O
. O
One B-CARDINAL
thing O
I O
do O
|
     | O
remember O
I O
did O
say O
, O
and O
pretty O
sharply O
too O
. O
She O
took O
our O
little O
Mary B-PERSON
by O
the O
waist O
, O
and O
— O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Thou B-PERSON
must O
leave O
off O
calling O
her O
' O

growing O
up O

  O
but O
all O
in O
a O
|
     | O
cheerful O
sort O
of O
manner O
, O
so O
we O
thought O
nothing O
about O
her O
kisses O
and O
shakes O
. O
But O
on O
Wednesday B-DATE
|
     | O
night O
comes O
Mrs. O
Bradshaw B-PERSON
's O
son O
with O
Esther B-PERSON
's O
box O
, O
and O
presently O
Mrs. O
Bradshaw B-PERSON
follows O
with O
the O
|
     | O
key O
  O
and O
when O
we O
began O
to O
talk O
, O
we O
found O
Esther B-PERSON
told O
her O
she O
was O
coming O
back O
to O
live O
with O
us O
, O
|
     | O
and O
would O
pay O
her O
week B-DATE
's O
money O
for O
not O
giving O
notice O
  O
and O
on O
Tuesday B-DATE
night B-TIME
she O
carried O
off O
a O
|
     | O
little O
bundle O
( O
her O
best O
clothes O
were O
on O
her O
back O
, O
as O
I O
said O
before O
) O
, O
and O
told O
Mrs. O
Bradshaw B-PERSON
not O
|
     | O
to O
hurry O
herself O
about O
the O
big O
box O
, O
but O
bring O
it O
when O
she O
had O
time O
. O
So O
of O
course O
she O
thought O
|
     | O
she O
should O
find O
Esther B-PERSON
with O
us O
  O
and O
when O
she O
told O
her O
story O
, O
my O
missis O
set O
up O
such O
a O
screech O
, O
|
     | O
and O
fell O
down O
in O
a O
dead O
swoon O
. O
Mary B-PERSON
ran O
up O
with O
water O
for O
her O
mother O
, O
and O
I O
thought O
so O
much O
|
     | O
about O
my O
wife O
, O
I O
did O
not O
seem O
to O
care O
at O
all O
for O
Esther B-PERSON
. O
But O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
day I-DATE
I O
asked O
all O
the O
|
     | O
neighbours O
( O
both O
our O
own O
and O
Bradshaw B-PERSON
's O
) O
, O
and O
they O
'd O
none O
of O
'em O
heard O
or O
seen O
nothing O
of O
her O
. O
|
     | O
I O
even O
went O
to O
a O
policeman O
, O
a O
good O
enough O
sort O
of O
man O
, O
but O
a O
fellow O
I O
'd O
never O
spoke O
to O
before O
|
     | O
because O
of O
his O
livery O
, O
and O
I O
asks O
him O
if O
his O
' O
cuteness O
could O
find O
any O
thing O
out O
for O
us O
. O
So O
I O
|
     | O
believe O
he O
asks O
other O
policemen O
  O
and O
one B-CARDINAL
on O
'em O
had O
seen O
a O
wench O
, O
like O
our O
Esther B-PERSON

walking O
very O

     | O
quickly O

with O
a O

on O

Many O
greetings O
were O
given O
and O
exchanged O
between O
the O
Wilsons B-ORG
and O
these O
women O
, O
for O
not O
long O
ago O

     | O
they O
had O
also O
dwelt O
in O
this O
court O
. O

Two B-CARDINAL
rude O
lads O
, O
standing O
at O
a O
disorderly O
looking O
house O
- O
door O
, O
exclaimed O
, O
as O
Mary B-PERSON
Barton I-PERSON
( O
the O

daughter O
) O
passed O
, O
" O
Eh O

Polly O
Barton B-PERSON
's O
gotten O
a O
sweetheart O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Of O
course O
this O
referred O
to O
young O
Wilson B-PERSON
, O
who O
stole O
a O
look O
to O
see O
how O
Mary B-PERSON
took O
the O
idea O
. O
He O
|
     | O
saw O
her O
assume O
the O
air O
of O
a O
young O
fury O
, O
and O
to O
his O
next O
speech O
she O
answered O
not O
a O
word O
. O
| 
  | O
Mrs. O
Barton B-PERSON
produced O
the O
key O
of O
the O
door O
from O
her O
pocket O
  O
and O
on O
entering O
the O
house O
- O
place O
it O
|
     | O
seemed O
as O
if O
they O
were O
in O
total O
darkness O
, O
except O
one B-CARDINAL
bright O
spot O
, O
which O
might O
be O
a O
cat O

eye O
, O

     | O
or O
might O
be O
, O
what O
it O
was O
, O
a O
red O
- O
hot O
fire O
, O
smouldering O
under O
a O
large O
piece O
of O
coal O
, O
which O
John B-PERSON

     | I-PERSON
Barton I-PERSON
immediately O
applied O
himself O
to O
break O
up O
, O
and O
the O
effect O
instantly O
produced O
was O
warm O
and O
|
     | O
glowing O
light O
in O
every O
corner O
of O
the O
room O
. O
To O
add O
to O
this O
( O
although O
the O
coarse O
yellow O
glare O
|
     | O
seemed O
lost O
in O
the O
ruddy O
glow O
from O
the O
fire O
) O
, O
Mrs. O
Barton B-PERSON
lighted O
a O
dip O
by O
sticking O
it O
in O
the O

     | O
fire O
, O
and O
having O
placed O
it O
satisfactorily O
in O
a O
tin O
candlestick O
, O
began O
to O
look O
further O
about O
|
     | O
her O
, O
on O
hospitable O
thoughts O
intent O
. O
The O
room O
was O
tolerably O
large O
, O
and O
possessed O
many O
|
     | O
conveniences O
. O
On O
the O
right O
of O
the O
door O
, O
as O
you O
entered O
, O
was O
a O
longish O
window O
, O
with O
a O
broad O

     | O
ledge O
. O
On O
each O
side O
of O
this O
, O
hung O
blue O
- O
and O
- O
white O
check O
curtains O
, O
which O
were O
now O
drawn O
, O
to O
shut O
|
     | O
in O
the O
friends O
met O
to O
enjoy O
themselves O
. O
Two B-CARDINAL
geraniums O
, O
unpruned O
and O
leafy O
, O
which O
stood O
on O
the O
|
     | O
sill O
, O
formed O
a O
further O
defence O
from O
out O

door O
pryers O

In O
the O
corner O
between O
the O
window O
and O
the O
|
     | O
fire O
- O
side O
was O
a O
cupboard O
, O
apparently O
full O
of O
plates O
and O
dishes O
, O
cups O
and O
saucers O
, O
and O
some O
more O
|
     | O
nondescript O
articles O
, O
for O
which O
one O
would O
have O
fancied O
their O
possessors O
could O
find O
no O
use O
— O
such O
|
     | O
as O
triangular O
pieces O
of O
glass O
to O
save O
carving O
knives O
and O
forks O
from O
dirtying O
table O
- O
cloths O
. O
|
     | O
However O
, O
it O
was O
evident O
Mrs. O
Barton B-PERSON
was O
proud O
of O
her O
crockery O
and O
glass O
, O
for O
she O
left O
her O
|
     | O
cupboard O
door O
open O
, O
with O
a O
glance O
round O
of O
satisfaction O
and O
pleasure O
. O
On O
the O
opposite O
side O
to O
|
     | O
the O
door O
and O
window O
was O
the O
staircase O
, O
and O
two B-CARDINAL
doors O
  O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
which O
( O
the O
nearest O
to O
the O
fire O
) O
|
     | O
led O
into O
a O
sort O
of O
little O
back O
kitchen O
, O
where O
dirty O
work O
, O
such O
as O
washing O
up O
dishes O
, O
might O
be O
|
     | O
done O
, O
and O
whose O
shelves O
served O
as O
larder O
, O
and O
pantry O
, O
and O
storeroom O
, O
and O
all O
. O
The O
other O
door O
, O
|
     | O
which O
was O
considerably O
lower O
, O
opened O
into O
the O
coal O
- O
hole O
— O
the O
slanting O
closet O
under O
the O
stairs O
  O
|
     | O
from O
which O
, O
to O
the O
fire O
- O
place O
, O
there O
was O
a O
gay O
- O
coloured O
piece O
of O
oil O
- O
cloth O
laid O
. O
The O
place O
|
     | O
seemed O
almost O
crammed O
with O
furniture O
( O
sure O
sign O
of O
good O
times O
among O
the O
mills O
) O
. O
Beneath O
the O
|
     | O
window O
was O
a O
dresser O
with O
three B-CARDINAL
deep O
drawers O
. O
Opposite O
the O
fire O
- O
place O
was O
a O
table O
, O
which O
I O
|
     | O
should O
call O
a O
Pembroke B-ORG
, O
only O
that O
it O
was O
made O
of O
deal O
, O
and O
I O
can O
not O
tell O
how O
far O
such O
a O
name O
|
     | O
may O
be O
applied O
to O
such O
humble O
material O
. O
On O
it O
, O
resting O
against O
the O
wall O
, O
was O
a O
bright O
green O
|
     | O
japanned O
tea O
- O
tray O
, O
having O
a O
couple O
of O
scarlet O
lovers O
embracing O
in O
the O
middle O
. O
The O
fire O
- O
light O
|
     | O
danced O
merrily O
on O
this O
, O
and O
really O
( O
setting O
all O
taste O
but O
that O
of O
a O
child O
's O
aside O
) O
it O
gave O
a O
|
     | O
richness O
of O
colouring O
to O
that O
side O
of O
the O
room O
. O
It O
was O
in O
some O
measure O
propped O
up O
by O
a O
crimson O
|
     | O
tea O
- O
caddy O
, O
also O
of O
japan B-GPE
ware O
. O
A O
round O
table O
on O
one B-CARDINAL
branching O
leg O
really O
for O
use O
, O
stood O
in O
the O
|
     | O
corresponding O
corner O
to O
the O
cupboard O
  O
and O
, O
if O
you O
can O
picture O
all O
this O
with O
a O
washy O
, O
but O
clean O
|
     | O
stencilled O
pattern O
on O
the O
walls O
, O
you O
can O
form O
some O
idea O
of O
John B-PERSON
Barton I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
home O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
tray O
was O
soon O
hoisted O
down O
, O
and O
before O
the O
merry O
chatter O
of O
cups O
and O
saucers O
began O
, O
the O
|
     | O
women O
disburdened O
themselves O
of O
their O
out O
- O
of O
- O
door O
things O
, O
and O
sent O
Mary B-PERSON
up O
stairs O
with O
them O
. O
|
     | O
Then O
came O
a O
long O
whispering O
, O
and O
chinking O
of O
money O
, O
to O
which O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Wilson B-PERSON
were O
too O
|
     | O
polite O
to O
attend O
  O
knowing O
, O
as O
they O
did O
full O
well O
, O
that O
it O
all O
related O
to O
the O

So O

     | O
they O
tried O

busily O

The O

strewed O

darkened O
with O
these O

In O

Her O

  | O
After O
her O

she O
felt O
chilly O

weary O
, O
and O
was O
busy O
trying O
to O

" O

What O

of O

She O
did O
not O
think O
of O
comparing O

but O
for O
all O
that O
she O
felt O
the O
delicious O
glow O
of O
the O
fire O
, O
the O
bright O
light O
that O
revelled O
in O

     | O
every O
corner O
of O
the O

, O
the O
savoury O

the O

And O
now O

| 
  | O
Mrs. O
Barton B-PERSON
knew O
manners O
too O
well O
to O
do O
any O
thing O
but O
sit O
at O
the O
tea O
- O
table O
and O
make O
tea O
, O
|
     | O
though O
in O
her O
heart O
she O
longed O
to O
be O
able O
to O
superintend O
the O
frying O
of O
the O
ham O
, O
and O
cast O
many O

     | O
an O
anxious O
look O
at O
Mary B-PERSON
as O
she O
broke O
the O
eggs O
and O
turned O
the O
ham O
, O
with O
a O
very O
comfortable O

     | O
portion O
of O
confidence O
in O
her O
own O
culinary O
powers O
. O
Jem B-PERSON
stood O
awkwardly O
leaning O
against O
the O
|
     | O
dresser O
, O
replying O
rather O
gruffly O
to O
his O
aunt O
's O
speeches O
, O
which O
gave O
him O
, O
he O
thought O
, O
the O
air O
of O
|
     | O
being O
a O
little O
boy O
  O
whereas O
he O
considered O
himself O
as O
a O
young O
man O
, O
and O
not O
so O
very O
young O
|
     | O
neither O
, O
as O
in O
two B-DATE
months I-DATE
he O
would O
be O
eighteen B-CARDINAL
. O
Barton B-PERSON
vibrated O
between O
the O
fire O
and O
the O
|
     | O
tea O
- O
table O
, O
his O
only O
drawback O
being O
a O
fancy O
that O
every O
now O
and O
then O
his O
wife O
's O
face O
flushed O
and O

     | O
contracted O
as O
if O
in O
pain O

At O
length O
the O
business O
actually O
began O
. O
Knives O
and O
forks O
, O
cups O
and O
saucers O
made O
a O
noise O
, O
but O
|
     | O
human O
voices O
were O
still O
, O
for O
human O
beings O
were O
hungry O
, O
and O
had O
no O
time O
to O
speak O
. O
Alice B-PERSON
first I-PERSON
|
     | O
broke O
silence O
  O
holding O
her O
tea O
- O
cup O
with O
the O
manner O
of O
one B-CARDINAL
proposing O
a O
toast O
, O
she O
said O
, O
" O

  | O
It O
was O
an O
unlucky O
toast O
or O
sentiment O
, O
as O
she O
instantly O
felt O
. O
Every O
one O
thought O
of O
Esther B-PERSON
, O
the O

     | O
absent O
Esther B-PERSON
  O
and O
Mrs. O

put O
down O
her O
food O
, O

could O
not O
hide O
the O
fast O
dropping O
tears O
. O

     | O
Alice B-PERSON
could O
have O
bitten O
her O
tongue O
out O

It O
was O
a O
wet O
blanket O

the O
evening B-TIME

     | O
poor O
Mrs. O

So O
George B-PERSON

set O
off O

up O
to O
Mrs. O
Barton B-PERSON

she O
took O
her O

almost O

asked O
who O
was O
|
     | O
there O
? O
| 
  | O
" O
Me O
, O
John B-PERSON
Barton I-PERSON
, O
" O
answered O
he O
, O
in O
a O
voice O
tremulous O
with O
agitation O
. O
" O
My O
missis O
is O
in O
labour O
, O
|
     | O
and O
, O
for O
the O
love O
of O
God O
, O
step O
in O
while O
I O
run O
for O
th O
' O
doctor O
, O
for O
she O
's O
fearful O
bad O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
While O
the O
woman O
hastily O
dressed O
herself O
, O
leaving O
the O
window O
still O
open O
, O
she O
heard O
cries O
of O
|
     | O
agony O
, O
which O
resounded O
in O
the O
little O
court O
in O
the O
stillness O
of O
the O
night O
. O
In O
less B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
five I-CARDINAL
|
     | O
minutes O
she O
was O
standing O
by O
Mrs. O
Barton B-PERSON
's O
bed O
- O
side O
, O
relieving O
the O
terrified O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
who O
went O
|
     | O
about O
, O
where O
she O
was O
told O
, O
like O
an O
automaton B-GPE
  O
her O
eyes O
tearless O
, O
her O
face O
calm O
, O
though O
deadly O
|
     | O
pale O
, O
and O
uttering O
no O
sound O
, O
except O
when O
her O
teeth O
chattered O
for O
very O
nervousness O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
cries O
grew O
worse O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
doctor O
was O
very O
long O
in O
hearing O
the O
repeated O
rings O
at O
his O
night O
- O
bell O
, O
and O
still O
longer O
in O
|
     | O
understanding O
who O
it O
was O
that O
made O
this O
sudden O
call O
upon O
his O
services O
  O
and O
then O
he O
begged O
|
     | O
Barton B-GPE
just O
to O
wait O
while O
he O
dressed O
himself O
, O
in O
order O
that O
no O
time O
might O
be O
lost O
in O
finding O
|
     | O
the O
court O
and O
house O
. O
Barton B-PERSON
absolutely O
stamped O
with O
impatience O
, O
outside O
the O
doctor O
's O
door O
, O
|
     | O
before O
he O
came O
down O
  O
and O
walked O
so O
fast O
homewards O
, O
that O
the O
medical O
man O
several O
times O
asked O
him O
|
     | O
to O
go O
slower O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Is O
she O
so O
very O
bad O
? O
" O
asked O
he O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Worse O
, O
much O
worser O
than O
ever O
I O
saw O
her O
before O
, O
" O
replied O
John B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
No O
! O
she O
was O
not O
— O
she O
was O
at O
peace O
. O
The O
cries O
were O
still O
for O
ever O
. O
John B-PERSON
had O
no O
time O
for O
|
     | O
listening O
. O
He O
opened O
the O
latched O
door O
, O
stayed O
not O
to O
light O
a O
candle O
for O
the O
mere O
ceremony O
of O
|
     | O
showing O
his O
companion O
up O
the O
stairs O
, O
so O
well O
known O
to O
himself O
  O
but O
, O
in O
two B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
was O
in O
the O
|
     | O
room O
, O
where O
lay O
the O
dead O
wife O
, O
whom O
he O
had O
loved O
with O
all O
the O
power O
of O
his O
strong O
heart O
. O
The O
|
     | O
doctor O
stumbled O
up O
stairs O
by O
the O
fire O
- O
light O
, O
and O
met O
the O
awe O
- O
struck O
look O
of O
the O
neighbour O
, O
|
     | O
which O
at O
once O
told O
him O
the O
state O
of O
things O
. O
The O
room O
was O
still O
, O
as O
he O
, O
with O
habitual O
tip O
- O
toe O
|
     | O
step O
, O
approached O
the O
poor O
frail O
body O
, O
whom O
nothing O
now O
could O
more O
disturb O
. O
Her O
daughter O
knelt O
|
     | O
by O
the O
bed O
- O
side O
, O
her O
face O
buried O
in O
the O
clothes O
, O
which O
were O
almost O
crammed O
into O
her O
mouth O
, O
to O
|
     | O
keep O
down O
the O
choking O
sobs O
. O
The O
husband O
stood O
like O
one B-CARDINAL
stupified O
. O
The O
doctor O
questioned O
the O
|
     | O
neighbour O
in O
whispers O
, O
and O
then O
approaching O
Barton B-PERSON
, O
said O
, O
" O
You O
must O
go O
down O
stairs O
. O
This O
is O
a O
|
     | O
great O
shock O
, O
but O
bear O
it O
like O
a O
man O
. O
Go O
down O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
He O
went O
mechanically O
and O
sat O
down O
on O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
chair O
. O
He O
had O
no O
hope O
. O
The O
look O
of O
death O
was O
|
     | O
too O
clear O
upon O
her O
face O
. O
Still O
, O
when O
he O
heard O
one B-CARDINAL
or O
two B-CARDINAL
unusual O
noises O
, O
the O
thought O
burst O
on O
|
     | O
him O
that O
it O
might O
only O
be O
a O
trance O
, O
a O
fit O
, O
a O
— O
he O
did O
not O
well O
know O
what,—but O
not O
death O
! O
Oh O
, O
not O
|
     | O
death O
! O
And O
he O
was O
starting O
up O
to O
go O
up O
stairs O
again O
, O
when O
the O
doctor O
's O
heavy O
cautious O
creaking O
|
     | O
footstep O
was O
heard O
on O
the O
stairs O
. O
Then O
he O
knew O
what O
it O
really O
was O
in O
the O
chamber O
above O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Nothing O
could O
have O
saved O
her O
— O
there O
has O
been O
some O
shock O
to O
the O
system O
— O
" O
and O
so O
he O
went O
on O
  O
|
     | O
but O
, O
to O
unheeding O
ears O
, O
which O
yet O
retained O
his O
words O
to O
ponder O
on O
  O
words O
not O
for O
immediate O
use O
|
     | O
in O
conveying O
sense O
, O
but O
to O
be O
laid O
by O
, O
in O
the O
store O
- O
house O
of O
memory O
, O
for O
a O
more O
convenient O
|
     | O
season O
. O
The O
doctor O
seeing O
the O
state O
of O
the O
case O
, O
grieved O
for O
the O
man O
  O
and O
, O
very O
sleepy O
, O
thought O
|
     | O
it O
best O
to O
go O
, O
and O
accordingly O
wished O
him O
good O
- O
night O
— O
but O
there O
was O
no O
answer O
, O
so O
he O
let O
himself O
|
     | O
out O
  O
and O
Barton B-PERSON
sat O
on O
, O
like O
a O
stock O
or O
a O
stone O
, O
so O
rigid O
, O
so O
still O
. O
He O
heard O
the O
sounds O
above O
|
     | O
too O
, O
and O
knew O
what O
they O
meant O
. O
He O
heard O
the O
stiff O
, O
unseasoned O
drawer O
, O
in O
which O
his O
wife O
kept O
|
     | O
her O
clothes O
, O
pulled O
open O
. O
He O
saw O
the O
neighbour O
come O
down O
, O
and O
blunder O
about O
in O
search O
of O
soap O
|
     | O
and O
water O
. O
He O
knew O
well O
what O
she O
wanted O
, O
and O
|  | O
why O
|  | O
she O
wanted O
them O
, O
but O
he O
did O
not O
|
     | O
speak O
, O
nor O
offer O
to O
help O
. O
At O
last O
she O
went O
, O
with O
some O
kindly O
- O
meant O
words O
( O
a O
text O
of O
comfort O
, O
|
     | O
which O
fell O
upon O
a O
deafened O
ear O
) O
, O
and O
something O
about O
" O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
" O
but O
which O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
in O
his O
bewildered O
|
     | O
state O
, O
he O
could O
not O
tell O
. O
| 
  | O
He O
tried O
to O
realise O
it O
, O
to O
think O
it O
possible O
. O
And O
then O
his O
mind O
wandered O
off O
to O
other O
days O
, O
|
     | O
to O
far O
different O
times O
. O
He O
thought O
of O
their O
courtship O
  O
of O
his O
first B-ORDINAL
seeing O
her O
, O
an O
awkward O
, O
|
     | O
beautiful O
rustic O
, O
far O
too O
shiftless O
for O
the O
delicate O
factory O
work O
to O
which O
she O
was O
apprenticed O
  O
|
     | O
of O
his O
first B-ORDINAL
gift O
to O
her O
, O
a O
bead O
necklace O
, O
which O
had O
long O
ago O
been O
put O
by O
, O
in O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
deep O
|
     | O
drawers O
of O
the O
dresser O
, O
to O
be O
kept O
for O
Mary B-PERSON
. O
He O
wondered O
if O
it O
was O
there O
yet O
, O
and O
with O
a O
|
     | O
strange O
curiosity O
he O
got O
up O
to O
feel O
for O
it O
  O
for O
the O
fire O
by O
this O
time O
was O
well O
- O
nigh O
out O
, O
and O
|
     | O
candle O
he O
had O
none O
. O
His O
groping O
hand O
fell O
on O
the O
piled O
- O
up O
tea O
things O
, O
which O
at O
his O
desire O
she O
|
     | O
had O
left O
unwashed O
till O
morning O
— O
they O
were O
all O
so O
tired O
. O
He O
was O
reminded O
of O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
daily O
|
     | O
little O
actions O
, O
which O
acquire O
such O
power O
when O
they O
have O
been O
performed O
for O
the O
last O
time O
, O
by O
|
     | O
one O
we O
love O
. O
He O
began O
to O
think O
over O
his O
wife O
's O
daily B-DATE
round O
of O
duties O
  O
and O
something O
in O
the O
|
     | O
remembrance O
that O
these O
would O
never O
more O
be O
done O
by O
her O
, O
touched O
the O
source O
of O
tears O
, O
and O
he O
|
     | O
cried O
aloud O
. O
Poor O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
meanwhile O
, O
had O
mechanically O
helped O
the O
neighbour O
in O
all O
the O
last O
|
     | O
attentions O
to O
the O
dead O
  O
and O
when O
she O
was O
kissed O
, O
and O
spoken O
to O
soothingly O
, O
tears O
stole O
quietly O
|
     | O
down O
her O
cheeks O
: O
but O
she O
reserved O
the O
luxury O
of O
a O
full O
burst O
of O
grief O
till O
she O
should O
be O
alone O
. O
|
     | O
She O
shut O
the O
chamber O
- O
door O
softly O
, O
after O
the O
neighbour O
had O
gone O
, O
and O
then O
shook O
the O
bed O
by O
which O
|
     | O
she O
knelt O
, O
with O
her O
agony O
of O
sorrow O
. O
She O
repeated O
, O
over O
and O
over O
again O
, O
the O
same O
words O
  O
the O
|
     | O
same O
vain O
, O
unanswered O
address O
to O
her O
who O
was O
no O
more O
. O
" O
Oh O
, O
mother O
! O
mother O
, O
are O
you O
really O
dead O
! O
|
     | O
Oh O
, O
mother O
, O
mother O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
At O
last O
she O
stopped O
, O
because O
it O
flashed O
across O
her O
mind O
that O
her O
violence O
of O
grief O
might O
|
     | O
disturb O
her O
father O
. O
All O
was O
still O
below O
. O
She O
looked O
on O
the O
face O
so O
changed O
, O
and O
yet O
so O
|
     | O
strangely O
like O
. O
She O
bent O
down O
to O
kiss O
it O
. O
The O
cold O
, O
unyielding O
flesh O
struck O
a O
shudder O
to O
her O
|
     | O
heart O
, O
and O
, O
hastily O
obeying O
her O
impulse O
, O
she O
grasped O
the O
candle O
, O
and O
opened O
the O
door O
. O
Then O
she O
|
     | O
heard O
the O
sobs O
of O
her O
father O
's O
grief O
  O
and O
quickly O
, O
quietly O
, O
stealing O
down O
the O
steps O
, O
she O
knelt O
|
     | O
by O
him O
, O
and O
kissed O
his O
hand O
. O
He O
took O
no O
notice O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
for O
his O
burst O
of O
grief O
would O
not O
be O
|
     | O
controlled O
. O
But O
when O
her O
shriller O
sobs O
, O
her O
terrified O
cries O
( O
which O
she O
could O
not O
repress O
) O
, O
rose O
|
     | O
upon O
his O
ear O
, O
he O
checked O
himself O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Child O
, O
we O
must O
be O
all O
to O
one O
another O
, O
now O

she O

is O
gone O

" O
whispered O
he O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Oh O

father O

what O
can O
I O
do O

Mary B-PERSON
got O
up O

kissed O

sadly O
went O
up O
stairs O
to O
the O
little O
closet O

where O
she O

     | O
slept O

She O
thought O
it O

no O

for O
that O
she O
could O
never O

threw O

herself O

the O

Barton B-PERSON
had O
been O
roused O
by O
his O
daughter O

entrance O
, O
both O
from O
his O
stupor O
and O
from O
his O

     | O
uncontrollable O
sorrow O
. O
He O
could O
think O
on O
what O
was O
to O
be O
done O
, O
could O
plan O
for O
the O
funeral O

could O

     | O
calculate O
the O
necessity O
of O
soon O
returning O
to O
his O
work O
, O
as O
the O
extravagance O
of O
the O
past O
night O
|
     | O
would O
leave O
them O
short O
of O
money O
, O
if O
he O
long O
remained O
away O
from O
the O
mill O

He O
was O
in O
a O
club O
, O
so O

     | O
that O
money O
was O
provided O
for O
the O
burial O

These O
things O
settled O
in O
his O
own O
mind O
, O
he O
recalled O
the O

     | O
doctor O
's O
words O
, O
and O
bitterly O
thought O
of O
the O
shock O

poor O

, O
in O
the O

mysterious O
disappearance O
of O
her O
cherished O
sister O

His O
feelings O
towards O
Esther B-PERSON
almost O
amounted O

     | O
to O
curses O

It O
was O
she O
who O
had O
brought O
on O
all O

Her O
giddiness O
, O
her O
lightness O
of O

     | O
conduct O

had O
wrought O
this O
woe O

His O
previous O

been O
tinged O
with O
wonder O

     | O
pity O

now O
he O
hardened O
his O
heart O

henceforward O

a O
changed O
man O

His O
gloom O

his O
sternness O
became O
habitual O

instead O

He O
was O
more O
obstinate O

Part O
of O
this O

the O

But O
part O
was O
her O

At O

it O
is O
a O
bewildering O
thing O
to O
the O
poor O

     | O

And O
when O

     | O
he O
knows O
trade O
is O
bad O
, O
and O
could O
understand O
( O
at O

partially O
) O
that O
there O
are O
not O
buyers O

     | O
enough O
in O
the O

to O
purchase O

consequently O
that O
there O
is O
no O

  O
when O
he O
would O
bear O

could O
he O
also O
see O
that O

     | O
his O

were O
bearing O
their O

I O
say O

bewildered O

( O

     | O
" O

to O
see O
that O
all O
goes O
on O
just O
as O
usual O
with O
the O
mill O

owners O

Large O
houses O

while O
spinners O

empty O

because O
the O
families O
that O

     | O

them O
are O
obliged O
to O
live O
in O

Carriages O

along O
the O

away O

these O
things O

thinking O
of O
the O
pale O

The O

contrast O
is O

Why O
should O

I O

I O
know O
what O
is O

in O
such O

but O
|
     | O
what O
I O
wish O
to O
impress O
is O
what O
the O
workman O
feels O

thinks O

True O
, O
that O
with O
child O
- O
like O

     | O
improvidence O

good O
times O

often O

him O
forget O
all O
prudence O

| 
  | O
But O
there O
are O
earnest O
men O

men O
who O
have O
endured O
wrongs O
without O

without O
ever O

( O

have O
caused O
all O

Among O

His O

as O
such O

pretty O

But O
he O
spent O

the O

when O

Hungry O
himself O

almost O
to O

     | O
an O

pitch O

ravenousness O
, O
but O
with O
the O
bodily O
pain O
swallowed O
up O
in O
anxiety O
for O
his O
|
     | O
little O
sinking O
lad O
, O
he O
stood O
at O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
shop O
windows O
where O
all O
edible O
luxuries O
are O
|
     | O
displayed O
  O
haunches O
of O
venison O

Stilton B-GPE

— O
all O
appetising O
sights O
to O
the O

     | O
common O
passer O
by O
. O
And O
out O
of O
this O
shop O
came O
Mrs. O
Hunter B-PERSON
! O
She O
crossed O
to O
her O
carriage O
, O
followed O
|
     | O
by O
the O
shopman O
loaded O
with O
purchases O
for O
a O
party O
. O
The O
door O
was O
quickly O
slammed O
to O
, O
and O
she O
|
     | O
drove O
away O
  O
and O
Barton B-GPE
returned O
home O
with O
a O
bitter O
spirit O
of O
wrath O
in O
his O
heart O
, O
to O
see O
his O
|
     | O
only O
boy O
a O
corpse O
! O
| 
  | O
You O
can O
fancy O
, O
now O
, O
the O
hoards O
of O
vengeance O
in O
his O
heart O
against O
the O
employers O
. O
For O
there O
are O
|
     | O
never O
wanting O
those O
who O
, O
either O
in O
speech O
or O
in O
print O
, O
find O
it O
their O
interest O
to O
cherish O
such O
|
     | O
feelings O
in O
the O
working O
classes O
  O
who O
know O
how O
and O
when O
to O
rouse O
the O
dangerous O
power O
at O
their O

     | O
command O
  O
and O
who O
use O
their O
knowledge O
with O
unrelenting O
purpose O
to O
either O
party O
. O
| 
  | O
So O
while O
Mary B-PERSON
took O
her O
own O
way O
, O
growing O
more O
spirited O
every O
day O
, O
and O
growing O
in O
her O
beauty O
|
     | O
too O
, O
her O
father O
was O
chairman O
at O
many O
a O
trades O
' O
union O
meeting O
  O
a O
friend O
of O
delegates O
, O
and O
|
     | O
ambitious O
of O
being O
a O
delegate O
himself O
  O
a O
Chartist B-NORP
, O
and O
ready O
to O
do O
any O
thing O
for O
his O
order O
. O
| 
  | O
But O
now O
times O
were O
good O
  O
and O
all O
these O
feelings O
were O
theoretical O
, O
not O
practical O
. O
His O
most O
|
     | O
practical O
thought O
was O
getting O
Mary B-PERSON
apprenticed O
to O
a O
dressmaker O
  O
for O
he O
had O
never O
left O
off O

     | O
disliking O
a O
factory O
life O
for O
a O
girl O
, O
on O
more O
accounts O
than O
one O
. O
| 
  | O
Mary B-PERSON
must O
do O
something O
. O
The O
factories O
being O
, O
as O
I O
said O
, O
out O
of O
the O
question O
, O
there O
were O
two B-CARDINAL
|
     | O
things O
open O
— O
going O
out O
to O
service O
, O
and O
the O
dressmaking O
business O
  O
and O
against O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
of O
these O
, O
|
     | O
Mary B-PERSON
set O
herself O
with O
all O
the O
force O
of O
her O
strong O
will O
. O
What O
that O
will O
might O
have O
been O
able O
to O
|
     | O
achieve O
had O
her O
father O
been O
against O
her O
, O
I O
can O
not O
tell O
  O
but O
he O
disliked O
the O
idea O
of O
parting O
|
     | O
with O
her O
, O
who O
was O
the O
light O
of O
his O
hearth O
, O
the O
voice O
of O
his O
otherwise O
silent O
home O
. O
Besides O
, O
|
     | O
with O
his O
ideas O
and O
feelings O
towards O
the O
higher O
classes O
, O
he O
considered O
domestic O
servitude O
as O
a O
|
     | O
species O
of O
slavery O
  O
a O
pampering O
of O
artificial O
wants O
on O
the O
one O
side O
, O
a O
giving O

up O

and O
quiet O

on O
the O

. O
How O
far O
his O
strong O
exaggerated O
feelings O
|
     | O
had O
any O
foundation O
in O
truth O
, O
it O
is O
for O
you O
to O
judge O
. O
I O
am O
afraid O
that O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
determination O
not O
|
     | O
to O
go O
to O
service O
arose O
from O
far O
less O
sensible O
thoughts O
on O
the O
subject O
than O
her O
father O
's O
. O
Three B-DATE

     | I-DATE
years I-DATE
of O
independence O
of O
action O
( O
since O
her O
mother O
's O
death O
such O
a O
time O
had O
now O
elapsed O
) O
had O
|
     | O
little O
inclined O
her O
to O
submit O
to O
rules O
as B-TIME
to I-TIME
hours I-TIME
and O
associates O
, O
to O
regulate O
her O
dress O
by O
a O
|
     | O
mistress O
's O
ideas O
of O
propriety O
, O
to O
lose O
the O
dear O
feminine O
privileges O
of O

with O
a O

and O
working O
night O

day O
to O
help O
one O
who O
was O
sorrowful O
. O
Besides O
all O
this O
, O
the O

     | O
sayings O
of O
her O
absent O
, O
her O
mysterious O
aunt O
, O
Esther B-PERSON
, O
had O
an O
unacknowledged O
influence O
over O
Mary B-PERSON
. O
|
     | O
She O
knew O
she O
was O
very O
pretty O
  O
the O
factory O
people O
as O
they O
poured O
from O
the O
mills O
, O
and O
in O
their O
|
     | O
freedom O
told O
the O
truth O
( O
whatever O
it O
might O
be O
) O
to O
every O
passer O
- O
by O
, O
had O
early O
let O
Mary B-PERSON
into O
the O
|
     | O
secret O
of O
her O
beauty O
. O
If O
their O
remarks O
had O
fallen O
on O
an O
unheeding O
ear O
, O
there O
were O
always O
young O
|
     | O
men O
enough O
, O
in O
a O
different O
rank O
from O
her O
own O
, O
who O
were O
willing O
to O
compliment O
the O
pretty O
|
     | O
weaver O
's O
daughter O
as O
they O
met O
her O
in O
the O
streets O
. O
Besides O
, O
trust O
a O
girl O
of O
sixteen B-CARDINAL
for O
knowing O
|
     | O
well O
if O
she O
is O
pretty O
  O
concerning O
her O
plainness O
she O
may O
be O
ignorant O
. O
So O
with O
this O
consciousness O
|
     | O
she O
had O
early O
determined O
that O
her O
beauty O
should O
make O
her O
a O
lady O
  O
the O
rank O
she O
coveted O
the O
more O
|
     | O
for O
her O
father O
's O
abuse O
  O
the O
rank O
to O
which O
she O
firmly O
believed O
her O
lost O
aunt O
Esther B-PERSON
had O
arrived O
. O
|
     | O
Now O
, O
while O
a O
servant O
must O
often O
drudge O
and O
be O
dirty O
, O
must O
be O
known O
as O
a O
servant O
by O
all O
who O
|
     | O
visited O
at O
her O
master O
's O
house O
, O
a O
dressmaker O
's O
apprentice O
must O
( O
or O
so O
Mary B-PERSON
thought O
) O
be O
always O
|
     | O
dressed O
with O
a O
certain O
regard O
to O
appearance O
  O
must O
never O
soil O
her O
hands O

and O
need O
never O
redden O

     | O
or O
dirty O
her O
face O
with O
hard O
labour O
. O
Before O
my O
telling O
you O
so O
truly O
what O
folly O
Mary B-PERSON
felt O
or O

     | O
thought O
, O
injures O
her O
without O

sixteen O

as O
I O
said O
before O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
was O
to O
be O
a O
dressmaker O
  O
and O
her O
ambition O
|
     | O
prompted O
her O
unwilling O
father O
to O
apply O
at O
all O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
establishments O
, O
to O
know O
on O
what O
terms O
|
     | O
of O
painstaking O
and O
zeal O
his O
daughter O
might O
be O
admitted O
into O
ever O
so O
humble O
a O
workwoman B-PERSON

     | O
situation O

But O
high O
premiums O
were O
asked O
at O
all O
  O
poor O
man O
! O
he O
might O
have O

giving O
up O
a O
day B-DATE

work O
to O
ascertain O
the O
fact O
. O
He O
would O
have O
been O
indignant O
, O
indeed O
, O
had O
he O
|
     | O
known O
that O
if O
Mary B-PERSON
had O
accompanied O
him O
, O
the O
case O
might O
have O
been O
rather O
different O
, O
as O
her O

     | O
beauty O
would O
have O
made O
her O
desirable O
as O
a O
show O

Then O
he O
tried O

at O
all O

     | O
the O

was O
necessary O

money O
he O
had O
none O

Disheartened O
and O
angry O
he O

     | O
went O
home O
at O
night B-TIME

declaring O
it O

Mary B-PERSON
Barton I-PERSON

But O
her O
husband O
still O
thought O
of O
her O
, O
although O
with O
a O
calm O
and O
quiet O
grief O

     | O
in O
the O
silent O
watches O
of O
the B-TIME
night I-TIME
: O
and O
Mary B-PERSON
would O
start O
from O
her O
hard O

earned O
sleep O
, O
and O
think O

     | O
in O
her O
half B-CARDINAL
- O
dreamy O
, O
half B-CARDINAL
- O
awakened O
state O
, O
she O
saw O
her O
mother O
stand O
by O
her O
bed O
- O
side O
, O
as O
she O
used O
|
     | O
to O
do O
" O
in O
the B-DATE
days I-DATE
of O
long O
- O
ago O
  O
" O
with O
a O
shaded O
candle O
and O
an O
expression O
of O
ineffable O
|
     | O
tenderness O
, O
while O
she O
looked O
on O
her O
sleeping O
child O
. O
But O
Mary B-PERSON
rubbed O
her O
eyes O
and O
sank O
back O
on O
|
     | O
her O
pillow O
, O
awake O
, O
and O
knowing O
it O
was O
a O
dream O
  O
and O
still O
, O
in O
all O
her O
troubles O
and O
perplexities O
, O
|
     | O
her O
heart O
called O
on O
her O
mother O
for O
aid O
, O
and O
she O
thought O
, O
" O
If O
mother O
had O
but O
lived O
, O
she O
would O

     | O
have O
helped O
me O

" O
Forgetting O
that O
the O
woman O
's O
sorrows O
are O
far O
more O
difficult O
to O
mitigate O
than O
a O

     | O
child O

, O
even O
by O
the O
mighty O
power O
of O
a O
mother O

love O
  O
and O
unconscious O
of O
the O
fact O
, O
that O
she O
was O
|
     | O
far O
superior O
in O
sense O
and O
spirit O
to O
the O
mother O
she O
mourned O
. O
Aunt B-PERSON
Esther I-PERSON
was O
still O
mysteriously O
|
     | O
absent O
, O
and O
people O
had O
grown O
weary O
of O
wondering O
and O
began O
to O
forget O
. O
Barton B-PERSON
still O
attended O
his O
|
     | O
club O
, O
and O
was O
an O
active O
member O
of O
a O
trades O
' O
union O
  O
indeed O
, O
more O
frequently O
than O
ever O
, O
since O
the O
|
     | O
time O
of O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
return O
in O
the O
evening O
was O
so O
uncertain O
  O
and O
, O
as O
she O
occasionally O
, O
in O
very O
busy O

     | O
times O
, O
remained O
all O
night O
. O
His O
chiefest O
friend O
was O
still O
George B-PERSON
Wilson I-PERSON

although O
he O
had O
no O

     | O
great O
sympathy O
on O
the O
questions O
that O
agitated O
Barton B-PERSON
's O
mind O
. O
Still O
their O
hearts O
were O
bound O
by O

     | O
old O
ties O
to O
one O
another O
, O
and O
the O
remembrance O
of O
former O
times O
gave O
an O
unspoken O
charm O
to O
their O

     | O
meetings O
. O
Our O
old O
friend O
, O
the O
cub O

made O
young O
man O

with O
a O
sensible O

enough O

a O

that O

it O
not O

marked O

He O
worked O
with O
one B-CARDINAL

of O
the O

His O
father O

were O
never O
weary O
of O
praising O
Jem B-PERSON
, O
at O
all O

     | O
which O
commendation O
pretty O
Mary B-PERSON
Barton I-PERSON
would O
toss O
her O
head O
, O
seeing O
clearly O
enough O
that O
they O

     | O
wished O
her O
to O
understand O
what O
a O
good O
husband O

would O
make O

and O
to O
favour O
his O
love O

about O

     | O
he O
never O
dared O

One B-DATE

in O

early O

Mary B-PERSON
and O

     | O
Alice B-PERSON
had O
always O
liked O
each O
other O
  O
indeed O
, O
Alice B-PERSON
looked O
with O
particular O
interest O
on O
the O

     | O
motherless O
girl O
, O
the O
daughter O
of O
her O
whose O
forgiving O
kiss O
had O
so O
comforted O
her O
in O
many O

     | O
sleepless O
hours O
. O
So O
there O
was O
a O
warm O
greeting O
between O
the O
tidy O
old O
woman O
and O
the O
blooming O
young O

girl O
  O
and O
then O
Alice B-PERSON
ventured O
to O
ask O
if O
she O
would O
come O
in O
and O
take O
her O
tea O
with O
her O
that O

     | O
very O
evening O

" O
You O
'll O
think O
it O
dull O
enough O
to O
come O
just O
to O
sit O
with O
an O
old O
woman O
like O
me O
, O
but O
there O

a O

tidy O
young O

lives O
in O
the O
floor O

does O
plain O
work O

and O
now O
and O
then O
a O
bit O
in O

     | O
your O
own O
line O
, O

Do O

Mary B-PERSON
! O
I O

genteel O

too O

" O
| 
  | O
At O
the O
beginning O
of O
this O
speech O
Mary B-PERSON
had O
feared O
the O
intended O
visitor O
was O
to O
be O
no O
other O
than O

     | O
Alice O
's O
nephew O
  O
but O
Alice B-PERSON
was O
too O
delicate O
- O
minded O
to O
plan O
a O
meeting O
, O
even O
for O
her O
dear O
Jem B-PERSON
, O
|
     | O
when O
one O
would O
have O
been O
an O
unwilling O
party O
  O
and O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
relieved O
from O
her O
apprehension O
by O
the O
|
     | O
conclusion O
, O
gladly O
agreed O
to O
come O
. O
How O
busy O
Alice B-PERSON
felt O
! O
it O
was O
not O
often O
she O
had O
any O
one O
to O
|
     | O
tea O
  O
and O
now O
her O
sense O
of O
the O
duties O
of O
a O
hostess O
were O
almost O
too O
much O
for O
her O
. O
She O
made O
haste O
|
     | O
home O
, O
and O
lighted O
the O
unwilling O
fire O
, O
borrowing O
a O
pair O
of O
bellows O
to O
make O
it O
burn O
the O
faster O
. O
|
     | O
For O
herself O
she O
was O
always O
patient O
  O
she O
let O
the O
coals O
take O
their O
time O
. O
Then O
she O
put O
on O
her O

     | O
pattens O
, O
and O
went O
to O
fill O
her O
kettle O
at O
the O
pump O
in O
the O
next O
court O
, O
and O
on O
the O
way O
she O
borrowed O
|
     | O
a O
cup O
  O
of O
odd O
saucers O
she O
had O
plenty O
, O
serving O
as O
plates O

required O

Half B-CARDINAL

     | O
of O
tea O
and O
a O
quarter O
of O

went O
far O
to O
absorb O
her O
morning B-TIME
's O
wages O
  O
but O
this O
was O
|
     | O
an O
unusual O
occasion O
. O
In O
general O
, O
she O
used O
herb O

tea O
for O
herself O
, O
when O
at O
home O
, O
unless O
some O

thoughtful O
mistress O
made O
her O

the O

and O
when O
to O
sit O
lightly O
  O
indeed O
the O
whole O
affair O
was O
more O

Alice B-PERSON

look O
about O

with O
satisfaction O

a O
sort O

could O
be O
done O
to O
add O
to O
the O

pulled O

the O
belief O

that O

just O
left O

     | O
she O
balanced O
herself O
on O
the O
board O
seat O

in O
order O
that O
Margaret B-PERSON

think O

her O

free O

independent O

" O

Mary B-PERSON
still O
delayed O
. O

  | O
The O
truth O
was O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
was O
dressing O
herself O
  O
yes O
, O
to O
come O
to O
poor O
old O
Alice's O
— O
she O
thought O
it O
|
     | O
worth O
while O
to O
consider O
what O
gown O
she O
should O
put O
on O
. O
It O
was O
not O
for O
Alice B-PERSON
, O
however O
, O
you O
may O
be O

     | O
pretty O
sure O
  O
no O
, O
they O
knew O
each O
other O
too O
well O

But O
Mary B-PERSON
liked O
making O
an O
impression O
, O
and O
in O

     | O
this O
it O
must O
be O
owned O
she O
was O
pretty O
often O
gratified O
— O
and O
there O
was O
this O
strange O
girl O
to O

     | O
consider O
just O
now O
. O
So O
she O
put O
on O
her O
pretty O
new O
blue O
merino O
, O
made O
tight O
to O
her O
throat O
, O
her O

     | O
little O
linen O
collar O

and O
sallied O
forth O
to O
impress O
poor O
gentle O
Margaret B-PERSON

She O

     | O
certainly O
succeeded O
. O
Alice B-PERSON
, O
who O
never O
thought O
much O
about O

had O
never O

Margaret B-PERSON

     | O
could O
hardly O
take O
her O
eyes O
off O
her O
, O
and O
Mary B-PERSON
put O
down O
her O
long O
black O
lashes O
with O
a O
sort O
of O

The O

a O
kind O

it O
may O
, O

it O
is O
that O
humour O

is O
near O

to O
those O
who O

it O

a O
powerfully O

Margaret B-PERSON

the O
heart O
to O

     | O
withal O
, O
her O
voice O
was O
of O
that O
rich O
and O
rare O
order O
, O
which O
does O
not O
require O
any O
great O
compass O
of O

     | O
notes O
to O
make O
itself O
appreciated O
. O
Alice B-PERSON
had O
her O
quiet O
enjoyment O
of O
tears O
. O
But O
Margaret B-PERSON
, O
with O
|
     | O
fixed O
eye O
, O
and O
earnest O
, O
dreamy O
look O
, O
seemed O
to O
become O
more O
and O
more O
absorbed O
in O
realising O
to O
|
     | O
herself O
the O
woe O
she O
had O
been O
describing O

which O
she O
felt O
might O
at O
that O
very O
moment O

Suddenly O
she O
burst O
forth O
with O
all O
the O
power O
of O

with O
tears O

holy O
sympathy O
in O
her O
eyes O
, O
Alice B-PERSON
thanked O

     | O
resumed O

much O
to O
Mary B-PERSON

wonder O

for O
she O
looked O
at O
her O
unweariedly O

if O
surprised O

When O

him O

     | O
the O
desired O
information O
, O
it O
would O
be O
a O
hand O
- O
loom O
weaver O
in O
Manchester B-GPE
, O
whom O
he O
named O
. O
Sir O

     | I-PERSON
Smith I-PERSON
proceeded O
by O
coach O
to O
Manchester B-ORG
, O
and O
on O
arriving O
at O
that O
town O
, O
he O
inquired O
of O
the O
porter O
|
     | O
who O
was O
carrying O
his O
luggage O
if O
he O

So O
and O
So O
. O

  | O
" O
Oh O
, O
yes O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
man O
. O
" O
He O
does O
a O
bit O
in O
my O
way O
  O
" O
and O
, O
on O
further O
investigation O
, O
it O
|
     | O
turned O
out O
, O
that O
both O
the O
porter O
, O
and O
his O
friend O
the O
weaver O
, O
were O
skilful O
botanists O
, O
and O
able O
|
     | O
to O
give O
Sir O
J. B-PERSON
E. I-PERSON
Smith I-PERSON
the O
very O
information O
which O
he O
wanted O
. O
| 
  | O
Such O
are O
the O
tastes O
and O
pursuits O
of O
some O
of O
the O
thoughtful O
, O
little O
understood O
, O
working O
men O
of O
|
     | O
Manchester B-FAC
. O
| 
  | O
And O
Margaret B-PERSON
's O
grandfather O
was O
one O
of O
these O
. O
He O
was O
a O
little O
wiry O
- O
looking O
old O
man O
, O
who O
moved O
|
     | O
with O
a O
jerking O
motion O
, O
as O
if O
his O
limbs O
were O
worked O
by O
a O
string O
like O
a O
child O
's O
toy O
, O
with O
dun O
|
     | O
coloured O
hair O
lying O
thin O
and O
soft O
at O
the O
back O
and O
sides O
of O
his O
head O
  O
his O
forehead O
was O
so O
large O
|
     | O
it O
seemed O
to O
overbalance O
the O
rest O
of O
his O
face O
, O
which O
had O
indeed O
lost O
its O
natural O
contour O
by O
the O
|
     | O
absence O
of O
all O
the O
teeth O
. O
The O
eyes O
absolutely O
gleamed O
with O
intelligence O
  O
so O
keen O
, O
so O
observant O
, O
|
     | O
you O
felt O
as O
if O
they O
were O
almost O
wizard O
- O
like O
. O
Indeed O
, O
the O
whole O
room O
looked O
not O
unlike O
a O
|
     | O
wizard O
's O
dwelling O
. O
Instead O
of O
pictures O
were O
hung O
rude O
wooden O
frames O
of O
impaled O
insects O
  O
the O
|
     | O
little O
table O
was O
covered O
with O
cabalistic O
books O
  O
and O
a O
case O
of O
mysterious O
instruments O
lay O
|
     | O
beside O
, O
one O
of O
which O
Job B-PERSON
Legh I-PERSON
was O
using O
when O
his O
grand O
- O
daughter O
entered O
. O
| 
  | O
On O
her O
appearance O
he O
pushed O
his O
spectacles O
up O
so O
as O
to O
rest O
midway O
on O
his O
forehead O
, O
and O
gave O
|
     | O
Mary B-PERSON
a O
short O
, O
kind O
welcome O
. O
But O
Margaret B-PERSON
he O
caressed O
as O
a O
mother O
caresses O
her O
first B-ORDINAL
- O
born O
  O
|
     | O
stroking O
her O
with O
tenderness O
, O
and O
almost O
altering O
his O
voice O
as O
he O
spoke O
to O
her O
. O
| 
  | O
Mary B-PERSON
looked O
round O
on O
the O
odd O
, O
strange O
things O
she O
had O
never O
seen O
at O
home O
, O
and O
which O
seemed O
to O
|
     | O
her O
to O
have O
a O
very O
uncanny O
look O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Is O
your O
grandfather O
a O
fortune O
- O
teller O
? O
" O
whispered O
she O
to O
her O
new O
friend O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
No O
, O
" O
replied O
Margaret B-PERSON
, O
in O
the O
same O
voice O
  O
" O
but O
you O
're O
not O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
as O
has O
taken O
him O
for O
|
     | O
such O
. O
He O
is O
only O
fond O
of O
such O
things O
as O
most O
folks O
know O
nothing O
about O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
And O
do O
you O
know O
aught O
about O
them O
, O
too O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
know O
a O
bit O
about O
some O
of O
the O
things O
grandfather O
is O
fond O
on O
  O
just O
because O
he O
's O
fond O
on O
'em O
|
     | O
I O
tried O
to O
learn O
about O
them O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
What O
things O
are O
these O
? O
" O
said O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
struck O
with O
the O
weird O
looking O
creatures O
that O
sprawled O
|
     | O
around O
the O
room O
in O
their O
roughly O
- O
made O
glass O
cases O
. O
| 
  | O
But O
she O
was O
not O
prepared O
for O
the O
technical O
names O
which O
Job B-PERSON
Legh I-PERSON
pattered O
down O
on O
her O
ear O
, O
on O
|
     | O
which O
they O
fell O
like O
hail O
on O
a O
skylight O
  O
and O
the O
strange O
language O
only O
bewildered O
her O
more O
than O
|
     | O
ever O
. O
Margaret B-PERSON
saw O
the O
state O
of O
the O
case O
, O
and O
came O
to O
the O
rescue O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Look B-WORK_OF_ART
, I-WORK_OF_ART
Mary I-WORK_OF_ART
, I-WORK_OF_ART
at O
this O
horrid O
scorpion O
. O
He O
gave O
me O
such O
a O
fright O
: O
I O
'm O
all O
of O
a O
twitter O
yet O
when O
|
     | O
I O
think O
of O
it O
. O
Grandfather O
went O
to O
Liverpool B-GPE
one B-CARDINAL
Whitsun B-GPE
- O
week O
to O
go O
strolling O
about O
the O
docks O

     | O
and O
pick O
up O
what O
he O
could O
from O
the O
sailors O
, O
who O
often O
bring O
some O
queer O
thing O
or O
another O
from O
|
     | O
the O
hot O
countries O
they O
go O
to O
  O
and O
so O
he O
sees O
a O
chap O
with O
a O
bottle O
in O
his O
hand O
, O
like O
a O

     | O
druggist O
's O
physic O
- O
bottle O
  O
and O
says O
grandfather O
, O
' O
What O
have O
ye O
gotten O
there O
? O
' O
So O
the O
sailor O

     | O
holds O
it O
up O
, O
and O
grandfather O
knew O
it O
was O
a O
rare O
kind O
o O
' O
scorpion O
, O
not O
common O
even O
in O
the B-LOC
East I-LOC

     | I-LOC
Indies I-LOC
where O
the O
man O
came O
from O

says O
he O
, O
' O
How O
did O
ye O
catch O
this O
fine O

for O
he O

would O

nothing O
I O

' O
And O
the O
man O
said O
as O
how O
when O
they O
were O
unloading O

     | O
the O
ship O
he O
'd O
found O
him O
lying O
behind O
a O
bag O
of O
rice O
, O
and O
he O
thought O
the O
cold O
had O
killed O
him O
, O
for O

     | O
he O
was O
not O
squashed O
nor O
injured O
a O

He O
did O
not O

any O
of O
the O
spirit O
out O
of O

     | O
his O
grog O
to O
put O
the O
scorpion O
in O
, O
but O
slipped O
him O
into O
the O
bottle O
, O
knowing O
there O
were O
folks O
enow O

     | O
who O
would O
give O
him O
something O
for O
him O

So O

him O
a O
shilling O

" O

" O
Two B-CARDINAL

interrupted O
Job B-PERSON
Legh I-PERSON

" O

a O
good O
bargain O
it O
was O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Well O
! O
grandfather O
came O
home O
as O
proud O
as O
Punch B-ORG
, O
and O
pulled O
the O
bottle O
out O
of O
his O
pocket O
. O
But O
|
     | O
you O
see O
th O
' O
scorpion O
were O
doubled O
up O
, O
and O
grandfather O
thought O
I O
could O
n't O
fairly O
see O
how O
big O
he O
|
     | O
was O
. O
So O
he O
shakes O
him O
out O
right O
before O
the O
fire O
  O
and O
a O
good O
warm O
one O

for O
I O
was O
ironing O

     | O
I O
remember O

I O
left O
off O
ironing O

and O
stooped O
down O
over O
him O
, O
to O
look O
at O
him O
better O
, O
and O
|
     | O
grandfather O
got O
a O
book O
, O
and O
began O
to O
read O
how O
this O
very O
kind O
were O
the O
most O
poisonous O
and O
|
     | O
vicious O
species O
, O
how O
their O
bite O
were O
often O
fatal O
, O
and O
then O
went O
on O
to O
read O
how O
people O
who O
were O

     | O
bitten O
got O
swelled O
, O
and O
screamed O
with O
pain O
. O
I O
was O
listening O
hard O
, O
but O
as O
it O
fell O
out O
, O
I O
never O

     | O
took O
my O
eyes O
off O
the O
creature O
, O
though O
I O
could O
not O

told O
I O
was O
watching O
it O

Suddenly O
it O

     | O
seemed O
to O
give O
a O
jerk O
, O
and O
before O
I O
could O
speak O
, O
it O
gave O
another O
, O
and O
in O
a O
minute O
it O
was O
as O

     | O
wild O
as O
could O
be O

running O
at O
me O
just O

" O

" O
What O

I O

So O
I O

not O
care O
for O
such O
things O
, O
" O
said O
Mary B-PERSON
. O

  | O
" O
Are O
you O
! O
Well O
, O
I O
'm O
often O
downright O
glad O
grandfather O
is O
so O
fond O
of O
his O
books O
, O
and O
his O
|
     | O
creatures O
, O
and O
his O
plants O
. O
It O
does O
my O
heart O
good O
to O
see O
him O
so O
happy O
, O
sorting O
them O
all O
at O
home O
, O
|
     | O
and O
so O
ready O
to O
go O
in O
search O
of O
more O
, O
whenever O
he O
's O
a O
spare O
day O
. O
Look O
at O
him O
now O
! O
he O
's O
gone O
|
     | O
back O
to O
his O
books O
, O
and O
he O
'll O
be O
as O
happy O
as O
a O
king O
, O
working O
away O
till O
I O
make O
him O
go O
to O
bed O
. O
It O
|
     | O
keeps O
him O
silent O
, O
to O
be O
sure O
  O
but O
so O
long O
as O
I O
see O
him O
earnest O
, O
and O
pleased O
, O
and O
eager O
, O
what O
|
     | O
does O
that O
matter O
? O
Then O
, O
when O
he O
has O
his O
talking O
bouts O
, O
you O
ca O
n't O
think O
how O
much O
he O

     | O
Dear O
grandfather O
! O
you O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
happy O
we O
are O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
Mary B-PERSON
wondered O
if O
the O
dear O
grandfather O
heard O
all O
this O
, O
for O
Margaret B-PERSON
did O
not O
speak O
in O
an O
under O
|
     | O
tone O
  O
but O
no O
! O
he O
was O
far O
too O
deep O
and O
eager O
in O
solving O
a O
problem O
. O
He O
did O
not O
even O
notice O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
|
     | O
leave O
- O
taking O
, O
and O
she O
went O
home O
with O
the O
feeling O
that O
she O
had O
that O
night O
made O
the O
acquaintance O
|
     | O
of O
two B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
strangest O
people O
she O
ever O
saw O
in O
her O
life O
. O
Margaret B-PERSON
, O
so O
quiet O
, O
so O
common O
place O
, O
|
     | O
until O
her O
singing O
powers O
were O
called O
forth O
  O
so O
silent O
from O
home O
, O
so O
cheerful O
and O
agreeable O
at O
|
     | O
home O
  O
and O
her O
grandfather O
so O
very O
different O
to O
any O
one O
Mary B-PERSON
had O
ever O
seen O
. O
Margaret B-PERSON
had O
said O
he O
|
     | O
was O
not O
a O
fortune O
- O
teller O
, O
but O
she O
did O
not O
know O
whether O
to O
believe O
her O
. O
| 
  | O
To O
resolve O
her O
doubts O
, O
she O
told O
the O
history O
of O
the O
evening O
to O
her O
father O
, O
who O
was O
interested O
|
     | O
by O
her O
account O
, O
and O
curious O
to O
see O
and O
judge O
for O
himself O
. O
Opportunities O
are O
not O
often O
wanting O
|
     | O
where O
inclination O
goes O
before O
, O
and O
ere O
the O
end O
of O
that O
winter O
Mary B-PERSON
looked O
upon O
Margaret B-PERSON
almost O
|
     | O
as O
an O
old O
friend O
. O
The O
latter O
would O
bring O
her O
work O
when O
Mary B-PERSON
was O
likely O
to O
be O
at O
home O
in O
the O
|
     | O
evenings O
and O
sit O
with O
her O
  O
and O
Job B-PERSON
Legh I-PERSON
would O
put O
a O
book O
and O
his O
pipe O
in O
his O
pocket O
and O
just O
|
     | O
step O
round O
the O
corner O
to O
fetch O
his O
grand O
- O
child O
, O
ready O
for O
a O
talk O
if O
he O
found O
Barton B-PERSON
in O
  O
ready O
|
     | O
to O
pull O
out O
pipe O
and O
book O
if O
the O
girls O
wanted O
him O
to O
wait O
, O
and O
John B-PERSON
was O
still O
at O
his O
club O
. O
In O
|
     | O
short O
, O
ready O
to O
do O
whatever O
would O
give O
pleasure O
to O
his O
darling O
Margaret B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
I O
do O
not O
know O
what O
points O
of O
resemblance O
( O
or O
dissimilitude O
, O
for O
the O
one B-CARDINAL
joins O
people O
as O
often O
|
     | O
as O
the O
other O
) O
attracted O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
girls O
to O
each O
other O
. O
Margaret B-PERSON
had O
the O
great O
charm O
of O
possessing O
|
     | O
good O
strong O
common O
sense O
, O
and O
do O
you O
not O
perceive O
how O
involuntarily O
this O
is O
valued O
? O
It O
is O
so O
|
     | O
pleasant O
to O
have O
a O
friend O
who O
possesses O
the O
power O
of O
setting O
a O
difficult O
question O
in O
a O
clear O
|
     | O
light O
  O
whose O
judgment O
can O
tell O
what O
is O
best O
to O
be O
done O
  O
and O
who O
is O
so O
convinced O
of O
what O
is O
|
     | O
" O
wisest O
, O
best O
, O
" O
that O
in O
consideration O
of O
the O
end O
, O
all O
difficulties O
in O
the O
way O
diminish O
. O
People O
|
     | O
admire O
talent O
, O
and O
talk O
about O
their O
admiration O
. O
But O
they O
value O
common O
sense O
without O
talking O
|
     | O
about O
it O
, O
and O
often O
without O
knowing O
it O
. O
| 
  | O
So O
Mary B-PERSON
and O
Margaret B-PERSON
grew O
in O
love O
one B-CARDINAL
toward O
the O
other O
  O
and O
Mary B-PERSON
told O
many O
of O
her O
feelings O
in O
|
     | O
a O
way O
she O
had O
never O
done O
before O
to O
any O
one O
. O
Most O
of O
her O
foibles O
also O
were O
made O
known O
to O
|
     | O
Margaret B-PERSON
, O
but O
not O
all O
. O
There O
was O
one B-CARDINAL
cherished O
weakness O
still O
concealed O
from O
every O
one O
. O
It O
|
     | O
concerned O
a O
lover O
, O
not O
beloved O
, O
but O
favoured O
by O
fancy O
. O
A O
gallant O
, O
handsome O
young O
man O
  O
but O
— O
not O
|
     | O
beloved O
. O
Yet O
Mary B-PERSON
hoped O
to O
meet O
him O
every O
day O
in O
her O
walks O
, O
blushed O
when O
she O
heard O
his O
name O
, O
|
     | O
and O
tried O
to O
think O
of O
him O
as O
her O
future O
husband O
, O
and O
above O
all O
, O
tried O
to O
think O
of O
herself O
as O
|
     | O
his O
future O
wife O
. O
Alas O
! O
poor O
Mary B-PERSON
! O
Bitter O
woe O
did O
thy O
weakness O
work O
thee O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
had O
other O
lovers O
. O
One B-CARDINAL
or O
two B-CARDINAL
would O
gladly O
have O
kept O
her O
company O
, O
but O
she O
held O
herself O
too O
|
     | O
high O
, O
they O
said O
. O
Jem B-PERSON
Wilson I-PERSON
said O
nothing O
, O
but O
loved O
on O
and O
on O
, O
ever O
more O
fondly O
  O
he O
hoped O
|
     | O
against O
hope O
  O
he O
would O
not O
give O
up O
, O
for O
it O
seemed O
like O
giving O
up O
life O
to O
give O
up O
thought O
of O
|
     | O
Mary B-PERSON
. O
He O
did O
not O
dare O
to O
look O
to O
any O
end O
of O
all O
this O
  O
the O
present O
, O
so O
that O
he O
saw O
her O
, O
touched O
|
     | O
the O
hem O
of O
her O
garment O
, O
was O
enough O
. O
Surely O
, O
in O
time O
, O
such O
deep O
love O
would O
beget O
love O
. O
| 
  | O
He O
would O
not O
relinquish O
hope O
, O
and O
yet O
her O
coldness O
of O
manner O
was O
enough O
to O
daunt O
any O
man O
  O
and O
|
     | O
it O
made O
Jem B-PERSON
more O
despairing O
than O
he O
would O
acknowledge O
for O
a O
long O
time O
even O
to O
himself O
. O
| 
  | O
But O
one B-TIME
evening I-TIME
he O
came O
round O
by O
Barton B-ORG
's O
house O
, O
a O
willing O
messenger O
for O
his O
father O
, O
and O
|
     | O
opening O
the O
door O
saw O
Margaret B-PERSON
sitting O
asleep O
before O
the O
fire O
. O
She O
had O
come O
in O
to O
speak O
to O
Mary B-PERSON
  O
|
     | O
and O
worn O
out O
by O
a O
long O
working O
, O
watching O
night B-TIME
, O
she O
fell O
asleep O
in O
the O
genial O
warmth O
. O
| 
  | O
An O
old O
- O
fashioned O
saying O
about O
a O
pair O
of O
gloves O
came O
into O
Jem B-PERSON
's O
mind O
, O
and O
stepping O
gently O
up O
|
     | O
he O
kissed O
Margaret B-PERSON
with O
a O
friendly O
kiss O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
awoke O
, O
and O
perfectly O
understanding O
the O
thing O
, O
she O
said O
, O
" O
For O
shame O
of O
yourself O
, O
Jem B-PERSON
! O
What O
|
     | O
would O
Mary B-PERSON
say O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
Lightly O
said O
, O
lightly O
answered O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
She O
'd O
nobbut O
say O
, O
practice O
makes O
perfect O
. O
" O
And O
they O
both O
laughed O
. O
But O
the O
words O
Margaret B-PERSON
had O
|
     | O
said O
rankled O
in O
Jem B-PERSON
's O
mind O
. O
Would O
Mary O
care O
? O
Would O
she O
care O
in O
the O
very O
least O
? O
They O
seemed O
to O
|
     | O
call O
for O
an O
answer O
by O
night B-TIME
, O
and O
by O
day O
  O
and O
Jem B-PERSON
felt O
that O
his O
heart O
told O
him O
Mary B-PERSON
was O
quite O
|
     | O
indifferent O
to O
any O
action O
of O
his O
. O
Still O
he O
loved O
on O
, O
and O
on O
, O
ever O
more O
fondly O
. O
| 
  | O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
father O
was O
well O
aware O
of O
the O
nature O
of O
Jem B-PERSON
Wilson I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
feelings O
for O
his O
daughter O
, O
but O
he O
|
     | O
took O
no O
notice O
of O
them O
to O
any O
one O
, O
thinking O
Mary B-PERSON
full O
young O
yet O
for O
the O
cares O
of O
married O
life O
, O
|
     | O
and O
unwilling O
, O
too O
, O
to O
entertain O
the O
idea O
of O
parting O
with O
her O
at O
any O
time O
, O
however O
distant O
. O
But O
|
     | O
he O
welcomed O
Jem B-PERSON
at O
his O
house O
, O
as O
he O
would O
have O
done O
his O
father O
's O
son O
, O
whatever O
were O
his O
motives O
|
     | O
for O
coming O
  O
and O
now O
and O
then O
admitted O
the O
thought O
, O
that O
Mary B-PERSON
might O
do O
worse O
when O
her O
time O
came O
, O
|
     | O
than O
marry O
Jem B-PERSON
Wilson I-PERSON
, O
a O
steady O
workman O
at O
a O
good O
trade O
, O
a O
good O
son O
to O
his O
parents O
, O
and O
a O
fine O

     | O
manly O
spirited O
chap O
— O
at O
least O
when O
Mary B-PERSON
was O
not O
by O
: O
for O
when O
she O
was O
present O
he O
watched O
her O
too O
|
     | O
closely O
, O
and O
too O
anxiously O
, O
to O
have O
much O
of O
what O
John B-PERSON
Barton I-PERSON
called O
" O
spunk O
" O
in O
him O
. O

It O
was O
towards O
the B-DATE

of I-DATE
February I-DATE
, O
in O
that B-DATE

, O
and O
a O
bitter O
black O
frost O
had O
lasted O
for O

     | O
many O
weeks O

The O
keen O
east O
wind O
had O
long O
since O
swept O
the O
streets O
clean O
, O
though O
on O
a O
gusty O
day O

     | O
the O

would O
rise O
like O

Houses O

every O

had O
washed O
them O
all O
over O
with O
a O
dark O

of O
Indian B-NORP

There O
was O
some O
reason O

there O
was O
somewhat O
the O
matter O
  O

, O
oh O
! O

     | O
it O
will O
grieve O
him O
sore O
whenever O
he O

so O
the O
later O
the O
better O
  O

besides O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
we O
've O

     | O
sometimes O
little O
enough O
to O
go O
upon O

what O
I O
earn O
is O
a O
great O

takes O
a B-DATE

a O
day O
there O
, O
for O

going O
after O

he O
'll O
think O
little O
enough O

     | O
of O
four B-CARDINAL

five I-CARDINAL

him O

in O
Manchester B-GPE

Indeed O
all O
that O

was O
comparatively O
old O

there O

now O
the O

Mary B-PERSON

was O
the O

when O
they O

     | O
joined O
the O

assembled O
to O
witness O

There O
was O
a O
murmur O
of O
many O
voices O
whenever O
the O

     | O
roaring O
of O
the O

" O

" O
asked O
Margaret B-PERSON

of O
a O

caught O
a O
few O

clear O

from O

" O

as O

, O
whither O
the O

was O
crowned O

     | O
and O
turreted O
with O
triumphant O
fire O

It O
sent O
forth O
its O
infernal O
tongues O
from O
every O
window O

, O

     | O
licking O
the O
black O

amorous O

an O

doorway O
where O
the O
men O

Those O
in O

and O
consequently O
best O
able O
to O

up O
to O
the O

said O
that O
several O

The O

been O
taken O
out O
before O
the O

aware O
of O
the O
attempt O

At O
length O
— O
for O
it O
seemed O
long O
, O
measured O
by O
beating O
hearts O
, O
though O
scarce O
two B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
had O

     | O
elapsed O
— O
the O
ladder O
was O
fixed O

an O
aerial O
bridge O
at O
a O
dizzy O
height O
, O
across O
the O
narrow O
street O
. O

  | O
Every O
eye O
was O
fixed O
in O
unwinking O
anxiety O
, O
and O
people O

very O
breathing O
seemed O
stilled O
in O

     | O
suspense O
. O
The O
men O
were O
nowhere O

the O
wind O
appeared O
, O
for O
the O
moment O
, O
higher O
than O

     | O
ever O
, O
and O
drove O
back O
the O
invading O
flames O

the O

  | O
Mary B-PERSON

Margaret B-PERSON
could O
see O
now O
  O
right O
above O
them O
danced O
the O
ladder O
in O
the O
wind O

The O
crowd O

     | O
pressed O
back O
from O
under O
  O
firemen O

helmets O
appeared O
at O
the O
window O
, O
holding O
the O
ladder O
firm O
, O
|
     | O
when O
a O
man O
, O
with O
quick O
, O
steady O
tread O
, O
and O
unmoving O
head O
, O
passed O
from O
one O
side O
to O
the O
other O
. O
The O
|
     | O
multitude O
did O
not O
even O
whisper O
while O
he O
crossed O
the O
perilous O
bridge O
, O
which O
quivered O
under O
him O
  O

     | O
but O
when O
he O
was O
across O
, O
safe O
comparatively O
in O
the O
factory O
, O
a O
cheer O
arose O
for O
an O
instant O
, O
|
     | O
checked O
, O
however O
, O
almost O
immediately O
, O
by O
the O
uncertainty O
of O
the O
result O
, O
and O
the O
desire O
not O
in O

     | O
any O
way O
to O
shake O
the O
nerves O
of O
the O
brave O
fellow O
who O
had O
cast O
his O
life O
on O
such O
a O
die O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
There O
he O
is O
again O
! O
" O
sprung O
to O
the O
lips O
of O
many O
, O
as O
they O
saw O
him O
at O
the O
doorway O
, O
standing O
as O
|
     | O
if O
for O
an O
instant O
to O
breathe O
a O
mouthful O
of O
the O
fresher O
air O
, O
before O
he O
trusted O
himself O
to O
cross O
. O

     | O
On O
his O
shoulders O
he O
bore O
an O
insensible O
body O
. O

  | O
" O
It O
's O
Jem B-PERSON
Wilson I-PERSON
and O
his O
father O
, O
" O
whispered O
Margaret B-PERSON
  O
but O
Mary B-PERSON
knew O
it O
before O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
people O
were O
sick O
with O
anxious O
terror O
. O
He O
could O
no O
longer O
balance O
himself O
with O
his O
arms O
  O
|
     | O
every O
thing O
must O
depend O
on O
nerve O
and O
eye O
. O
They O
saw O
the O
latter O
was O
fixed O
, O
by O
the O
position O
of O
the O
|
     | O
head O
, O
which O
never O
wavered O
  O
the O
ladder O
shook O
under O
the O
double O
weight O
  O
but O
still O
he O
never O
moved O
|
     | O
his O
head O
— O
he O
dared O
not O
look O
below O
. O
It O
seemed O
an O
age O
before O
the O
crossing O
was O
accomplished O
. O
At O
|
     | O
last O
the O
window O
was O
gained O
  O
the O
bearer O
relieved O
from O
his O
burden O
  O
both O
had O
disappeared O
. O
| 
  | O
Then O
the O
multitude O
might O
shout O
  O
and O
above O
the O
roaring O
flames O
, O
louder O
than O
the O
blowing O
of O
the O
|
     | O
mighty O
wind O
, O
arose O
that O
tremendous O
burst O
of O
applause O
at O
the O
success O
of O
the O
daring O
enterprise O
. O
|
     | O
Then O
a O
shrill O
cry O
was O
heard O
, O
asking O
| 
  | O
" O
Is O
the O
oud O
man O
alive O
, O
and O
likely O
to O
do O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Ay O
, O
" O
answered O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
firemen O
to O
the O
hushed O
crowd O
below O
. O
" O
He O
's O
coming O
round O
finely O
, O
now O

     | O
he O
's O
had O
a O
dash O
of O
cowd O
water O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
He O
drew O
back O
his O
head O
  O
and O
the O
eager O
inquiries O
, O
the O
shouts O
, O
the O
sea O
- O
like O
murmurs O
of O
the O
|
     | O
moving O
rolling O
mass O
began O
again O
to O
be O
heard O
— O
but O
for O
an O
instant O
though O
. O
In O
far O
less O
time O
than O
|
     | O
even O
that O
in O
which O
I O
have O
endeavoured O
briefly O
to O
describe O
the O
pause O
of O
events O
, O
the O
same O
bold O
|
     | O
hero O
stepped O
again O
upon O
the O
ladder O
, O
with O
evident O
purpose O
to O
rescue O
the O
man O
yet O
remaining O
in O
the O
|
     | O
burning O
mill O
. O
| 
  | O
He O
went O
across O
in O
the O
same O
quick O
steady O
manner O
as O
before O
, O
and O
the O
people O
below O
, O
made O
less O
|
     | O
acutely O
anxious O
by O
his O
previous O
success O
, O
were O
talking O
to O
each O
other O
, O
shouting O
out O
intelligence O

     | O
of O
the O
progress O
of O
the O
fire O
at O
the O
other O
end O
of O
the O
factory O
, O
telling O
of O
the O
endeavours O
of O
the O
|
     | O
firemen O
at O
that O
part O
to O
obtain O
water O
, O
while O
the O
closely O
packed O
body O
of O
men O
heaved O
and O
rolled O
|
     | O
from O
side O
to O
side O
. O
It O
was O
different O
from O
the O
former O
silent O
breathless O
hush O
. O
I O
do O
not O
know O
if O
it O

     | O
were O
from O
this O
cause O
, O
or O
from O
the O
recollection O
of O
peril O
past O
, O
or O
that O
he O
looked O
below O
, O
in O
the O

     | O
breathing O
moment O
before O
returning O
with O
the O
remaining O
person O
( O
a O
slight O
little O
man O
) O
slung O
across O

     | O
his O
shoulders O
, O
but O
Jem B-PERSON
Wilson I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
step O
was O
less O
steady O
, O
his O
tread O
more O
uncertain O
  O
he O
seemed O
to O
|
     | O
feel O
with O
his O
foot O
for O
the O
next O
round O
of O
the O
ladder O
, O
to O
waver O
, O
and O
finally O
to O
stop O
half B-CARDINAL
- O
way O
. O
By O
|
     | O
this O
time O
the O
crowd O
was O
still O
enough O
  O
in O
the O
awful O
instant O
that O
intervened O
no O
one O
durst O
speak O
, O
|
     | O
even O
to O
encourage O
. O
Many O
turned O
sick O
with O
terror O
, O
and O
shut O
their O
eyes O
to O
avoid O
seeing O
the O
|
     | O
catastrophe O
they O
dreaded O
. O
It O
came O
. O
The O
brave O
man O
swayed O
from O
side O
to O
side O
, O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
as O
slightly O
|
     | O
as O
if O
only O
balancing O
himself O
  O
but O
he O
was O
evidently O
losing O
nerve O
, O
and O
even O
sense O
: O
it O
was O
only O
|
     | O
wonderful O
how O
the O
animal O
instinct O
of O
self O
- O
preservation O
did O
not O
overcome O
every O
generous O
feeling O
, O
|
     | O
and O
impel O
him O
at O
once O
to O
drop O
the O
helpless O
, O
inanimate O
body O
he O
carried O
  O
perhaps O
the O
same O
|
     | O
instinct O
told O
him O
, O
that O
the O
sudden O
loss O
of O
so O
heavy O
a O
weight O
would O
of O
itself O
be O
a O
great O
and O
|
     | O
imminent O
danger O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Help O
me O
! O
she O
's O
fainted O
, O
" O
cried O
Margaret B-PERSON
. O
But O
no O
one O
heeded O
. O
All O
eyes O
were O
directed O
upwards O
. O
|
     | O
At O
this O
point O
of O
time O
a O
rope O
, O
with O
a O
running O
noose O
, O
was O
dexterously O
thrown O
by O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
|
     | O
firemen O
, O
after O
the O
manner O
of O
a O
lasso O
, O
over O
the O
head O
and O
round O
the O
bodies O
of O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
men O
. O
True O
, O
|
     | O
it O
was O
with O
rude O
and O
slight O
adjustment O
: O
but O
, O
slight O
as O
it O
was O
, O
it O
served O
as O
a O
steadying O
guide O
  O
|
     | O
it O
encouraged O
the O
sinking O
heart O
, O
the O
dizzy O
head O
. O
Once O
more O
Jem B-PERSON
stepped O
onwards O
. O
He O
was O
not O
|
     | O
hurried O
by O
any O
jerk O
or O
pull O
. O
Slowly O
and O
gradually O
the O
rope O
was O
hauled O
in O
, O
slowly O
and O
gradually O
|
     | O
did O
he O
make O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
or I-CARDINAL
five I-CARDINAL
paces O
between O
him O
and O
safety O
. O
The O
window O
was O
gained O
, O
and O
all O
were O
|
     | O
saved O
. O
The O
multitude O
in O
the O
street O
absolutely O
danced O
with O
triumph O
, O
and O
huzzaed O
and O
yelled O
till O
|
     | O
you O
would O
have O
fancied O
their O
very O
throats O
would O
crack O
  O
and O
then O
with O
all O
the O
fickleness O
of O
|
     | O
interest O
characteristic O
of O
a O
large O
body O
of O
people O
, O
pressed O
and O
stumbled O
, O
and O
cursed O
and O
swore O
|
     | O
in O
the O
hurry O
to O
get O
out O
of O
Dunham O
Street O
, O
and O
back O
to O
the O
immediate O
scene O
of O
the O
fire O
, O
the O
|
     | O
mighty O
diapason O
of O
whose O
roaring O
flames O
formed O
an O
awful O
accompaniment O
to O
the O
screams O
, O
and O
|
     | O
yells O
, O
and O
imprecations O
, O
of O
the O
struggling O
crowd O
. O
| 
  | O
As O
they O
pressed O
away O
, O
Margaret B-PERSON
was O
left O
, O
pale O
and O
almost O
sinking O
under O
the O
weight O
of O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
|
     | O
body O
, O
which O
she O
had O
preserved O
in O
an O
upright O
position O
by O
keeping O
her O
arms O
tight O
round O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
|
     | O
waist O
, O
dreading O
, O
with O
reason O
, O
the O
trampling O
of O
unheeding O
feet O
. O
| 
  | O
Now O
, O
however O
, O
she O
gently O
let O
her O
down O
on O
the O
cold O
clean O
pavement O
  O
and O
the O
change O
of O
posture O
, O
|
     | O
and O
the O
difference O
in O
temperature O
, O
now O
that O
the O
people O
had O
withdrawn O
from O
their O
close O
|
     | O
neighbourhood O
, O
speedily O
restored O
her O
to O
consciousness O
. O
| 
  | O
Her O
first B-ORDINAL
glance O
was O
bewildered O
and O
uncertain O
. O
She O
had O
forgotten O
where O
she O
was O
. O
Her O
cold O
, O
|
     | O
hard O
bed O
felt O
strange O
  O
the O
murky O
glare O
in O
the O
sky O
affrighted O
her O
. O
She O
shut O
her O
eyes O
to O
think O
, O
|
     | O
to O
recollect O
. O
| 
  | O
Her O
next O
look O
was O
upwards O
. O
The O
fearful O
bridge O
had O
been O
withdrawn O
  O
the O
window O
was O
|
     | O
unoccupied O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
They O
are O
safe O

" O
said O
Margaret B-PERSON

| 
  | O
" O
All O
? O
Are O
all O
safe O
, O
Margaret B-PERSON
? O
" O
asked O
Mary B-PERSON

  | O
" O
Ask O
yon B-PERSON
fireman I-PERSON

he O
'll O
tell O
you O

" O
| 
  | O
The O
fireman O
hastily O
corroborated O
Margaret B-PERSON

words O
. O

" O
Why O
did O
you O
let O
Jem B-PERSON

go O
twice O

" O
asked O
Margaret B-PERSON

" O

the O

well O

He O
loitered O

giving O
an O

came O
on O

Mary B-PERSON

in O
an O

, O
which O
Margaret B-PERSON
could O
not O
avoid O
hearing O
, O

     | O

said O

" O

Mary B-PERSON
hung O

answered O
not O

in O

When O

smoking O
his O

unwilling O

     | O
yet O
very O
willing O
to O
hear O
all O
the O

Margaret B-PERSON
went O
over O
the O

and O
it O
was O
amusing O
to O
watch O

First B-ORDINAL
, O
the O

     | O
regular O
puffing O
abated O
, O
then O
ceased O

Then O
the O
pipe O
was O
fairly O
taken O
out O
of O
his O
mouth O

and O
held O

     | O
suspended O

Then O
he O
rose O

at O
every O

point O
he O
came O
a O
step O
nearer O
to O
the O
narrator O
. O

  | O
When O
it O
was O
ended O
, O
he O
swore O
( O
an O
unusual O
thing O

him O

that O
if O

not O
a O

  | O
Margaret B-PERSON
laughed O
, O
but O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
now O
recovered O
from O
her O

pouted O

angry O

The O

So O
Barton B-PERSON
was O
now O
left O
alone O
with O
a O
little O
child O
, O
crying O
( O
when O
it O
had O
done O
eating O
) O
for O
mammy O
  O
|
     | O
with O
a O
fainting O
, O
dead O
- O
like O
woman O
  O
and O
with O
the O
sick O
man O
, O
whose O
mutterings O
were O
rising O
up O
to O
|
     | O
screams O
and O
shrieks O
of O
agonised O
anxiety O
. O
He O
carried O
the O
woman O
to O
the O
fire O
, O
and O
chafed O
her O
|
     | O
hands O
. O
He O
looked O
around O
for O
something O
to O
raise O
her O
head O
. O
There O
was O
literally O
nothing O
but O
some O
|
     | O
loose O
bricks O
. O
However O
, O
those O
he O
got O
  O
and O
taking O
off O
his O
coat O
he O
covered O
them O
with O
it O
as O
well O
as O
|
     | O
he O
could O
. O
He O
pulled O
her O
feet O
to O
the O
fire O
, O
which O
now O
began O
to O
emit O
some O
faint O
heat O
. O
He O
looked O
|
     | O
round O
for O
water O
, O
but O
the O
poor O
woman O
had O
been O
too O
weak O
to O
drag O
herself O
out O
to O
the O
distant O
pump O
, O
|
     | O
and O
water O
there O
was O
none O
. O
He O
snatched O
the O
child O
, O
and O
ran O
up O
the O
area O
- O
steps O
to O
the O
room O
above O
, O
|
     | O
and O
borrowed O
their O
only O
saucepan O
with O
some O
water O
in O
it O
. O
Then O
he O
began O
, O
with O
the O
useful O
skill O
of O
|
     | O
a O
working O
- O
man O
, O
to O
make O
some O
gruel O
  O
and O
when O
it O
was O
hastily O
made O
he O
seized O
a O
battered O
iron O
|
     | O
table O
- O
spoon O
( O
kept O
when O
many O
other O
little O
things O
had O
been O
sold O
in O
a O
lot O
) O
, O
in O
order O
to O
feed O
baby O
, O
|
     | O
and O
with O
it O
he O
forced O
one B-CARDINAL
or O
two B-CARDINAL
drops O
between O
her O
clenched O
teeth O
. O
The O
mouth O
opened O
|
     | O
mechanically O
to O
receive O
more O
, O
and O
gradually O
she O
revived O
. O
She O
sat O
up O
and O
looked O
round O
  O
and O
|
     | O
recollecting O
all O
, O
fell O
down O
again O
in O
weak O
and O
passive O
despair O
. O
Her O
little O
child O
crawled O
to O
her O
, O
|
     | O
and O
wiped O
with O
its O
fingers O
the O
thick O
- O
coming O
tears O
which O
she O
now O
had O
strength O
to O
weep O
. O
It O
was O
|
     | O
now O
high O
time O
to O
attend O
to O
the O
man O
. O
He O
lay O
on O
straw O
, O
so O
damp O
and O
mouldy O
no O
dog O
would O
have O
|
     | O
chosen O
it O
in O
preference O
to O
flags O
  O
over O
it O
was O
a O
piece O
of O
sacking O
, O
coming O
next O
to O
his O
worn O
|
     | O
skeleton O
of O
a O
body O
  O
above O
him O
was O
mustered O
every O
article O
of O
clothing O
that O
could O
be O
spared O
by O
|
     | O
mother O
or O
children O
this O
bitter O
weather O
  O
and O
in O
addition O
to O
his O
own O
, O
these O
might O
have O
given O
as O
|
     | O
much O
warmth O
as O
one B-CARDINAL
blanket O
, O
could O
they O
have O
been O
kept O
on O
him O
  O
but O
as O
he O
restlessly O
tossed O
to O
|
     | O
and O
fro O
, O
they O
fell O
off O
and O
left O
him O
shivering O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
burning O
heat O
of O
his O
skin O
. O
Every O
|
     | O
now O
and O
then O
he O
started O
up O
in O
his O
naked O
madness O
, O
looking O
like O
the O
prophet O
of O
woe O
in O
the O
fearful O
|
     | O
plague O
- O
picture O
  O
but O
he O
soon O
fell O
again O
in O
exhaustion O
, O
and O
Barton B-PERSON
found O
he O
must O
be O
closely O
|
     | O
watched O
, O
lest O
in O
these O
falls O
he O
should O
injure O
himself O
against O
the O
hard O
brick O
floor O
. O
He O
was O
|
     | O
thankful O
when O
Wilson B-ORG
re O
- O
appeared O
, O
carrying O
in O
both O
hands O
a O
jug O
of O
steaming O
tea O
, O
intended O
for O
|
     | O
the O
poor O
wife O
  O
but O
when O
the O
delirious O
husband O
saw O
drink O
, O
he O
snatched O
at O
it O
with O
animal O
|
     | O
instinct O
, O
with O
a O
selfishness O
he O
had O
never O
shown O
in O
health O
. O
| 
  | O
Then O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
men O
consulted O
together O
. O
It O
seemed O
decided O
, O
without O
a O
word O
being O
spoken O
on O
the O
|
     | O
subject O
, O
that O
both O
should O
spend O
the B-TIME
night I-TIME
with O
the O
forlorn O
couple O
  O
that O
was O
settled O
. O
But O
could O
|
     | O
no O
doctor O
be O
had O
? O
In O
all O
probability O
, O
no O
  O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
day I-DATE
an O
infirmary O
order O
might O
be O
begged O
, O
but O
|
     | O
meanwhile O
the O
only O
medical O
advice O
they O
could O
have O
must O
be O
from O
a O
druggist O
's O
. O
So O
Barton B-PERSON
( O
being O
|
     | O
the O
moneyed O
man O
) O
set O
out O
to O
find O
a O
shop O
in O
London B-FAC
Road I-FAC
. O
| 
  | O
It O
is O
a O
pretty O
sight O
to O
walk O
through O
a O
street O
with O
lighted O
shops O
  O
the O
gas O
is O
so O
brilliant O
, O
|
     | O
the O
display O
of O
goods O
so O
much O
more O
vividly O
shown O
than O
by O
day O
, O
and O
of O
all O
shops O
a O
druggist O
's O
|
     | O
looks O
the O
most O
like O
the O
tales O
of O
our O
childhood O
, O
from O
Aladdin B-ORG
's O
garden O
of O
enchanted O
fruits O
to O
|
     | O
the O
charming O
Rosamond B-ORG
with O
her O
purple O
jar O
. O
No O
such O
associations O
had O
Barton B-GPE
  O
yet O
he O
felt O
the O
|
     | O
contrast O
between O
the O
well O
- O
filled O
, O
well O
- O
lighted O
shops O
and O
the O
dim O
gloomy O
cellar O
, O
and O
it O
made O
him O
|
     | O
moody O
that O
such O
contrasts O
should O
exist O
. O
They O
are O
the O
mysterious O
problem O
of O
life O
to O
more O
than O
|
     | O
him O
. O
He O
wondered O
if O
any O
in O
all O
the O
hurrying O
crowd O
had O
come O
from O
such O
a O
house O
of O
mourning O
. O
He O
|
     | O
thought O
they O
all O
looked O
joyous O
, O
and O
he O
was O
angry O
with O
them O
. O
But O
he O
could O
not O
, O
you O
can O
not O
, O
read O
|
     | O
the O
lot O
of O
those O
who O
daily O
pass O
you O
by O
in O
the O
street O
. O
How O
do O
you O
know O
the O
wild O
romances O
of O
|
     | O
their O
lives O
  O
the O
trials O
, O
the O
temptations O
they O
are O
even O
now O
enduring O
, O
resisting O
, O
sinking O
under O
? O
|
     | O
You O
may O
be O
elbowed O
one B-CARDINAL
instant O
by O
the O
girl O
desperate O
in O
her O
abandonment O
, O
laughing O
in O
mad O
|
     | O
merriment O
with O
her O
outward O
gesture O
, O
while O
her O
soul O
is O
longing O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
dead O
, O
and O
|
     | O
bringing O
itself O
to O
think O
of O
the O
cold O
- O
flowing O
river O
as O
the O
only O
mercy O
of O
God O
remaining O
to O
her O
|
     | O
here O
. O
You O
may O
pass O
the O
criminal O
, O
meditating O
crimes O
at O
which O
you O
will O
to O
- O
morrow O
shudder O
with O
|
     | O
horror O
as O
you O
read O
them O
. O
You O
may O
push O
against O
one O
, O
humble O
and O
unnoticed O
, O
the O
last O
upon O
earth O
, O

     | O
who O
in O
Heaven O
will O
for O
ever O
be O
in O
the O
immediate O

Errands O

you O

Barton B-PERSON
's O
was O
an O
errand O
of O
mercy O
  O
but O
the O
thoughts O
of O
his O
heart O
were O
touched O
by O
sin O
, O
by O

     | O
bitter O
hatred O
of O
the O
happy O
, O
whom O
he O
, O
for O
the O
time O
, O
confounded O
with O

reached O

The O

been O
salved O
over O

listened O
attentively O
to O
Barton B-ORG

description O
of O

     | O
Davenport B-GPE

illness O
  O
concluded O
it O
was O
typhus O
fever O
, O
very O
prevalent O
in O
that O
neighbourhood O
  O
and O
|
     | O
proceeded O
to O
make O
up O
a O
bottle O
of O
medicine O
, O
sweet O
spirits O
of O
nitre O

some O
such O
innocent O

     | O
potion O

very O
good O
for O
slight O
colds O
, O
but O
utterly O
powerless O
to O
stop O
, O
for O
an O
instant O
, O
the O
raging O

     | O
fever O
of O
the O
poor O
man O
it O
was O
intended O
to O
relieve O

He O
recommended O
the O

Barton B-PERSON

     | O
left O
the O

faith O
in O
the O

given O
him O
  O
for O
men O

He O

only O
for O
an O

  O
it O

The O

When O

was O
a O
good O
house O
, O
and O
furnished O
with O
disregard O
to O
expense O
. O
But O
in O
addition O
to O
lavish O
|
     | O
expenditure O
, O
there O
was O
much O
taste O
shown O
, O
and O
many O
articles O
chosen O
for O
their O
beauty O
and O
elegance O
|
     | O
adorned O
his O
rooms O
. O
As O
Wilson B-ORG
passed O
a O
window O
which O
a O
housemaid O
had O
thrown O
open O
, O
he O
saw O
pictures O
|
     | O
and O
gilding O
, O
at O
which O
he O
was O
tempted O
to O
stop O
and O
look O
  O
but O
then O
he O
thought O
it O
would O
not O
be O
|
     | O
respectful O
. O
So O
he O
hastened O
on O
to O
the O
kitchen O
door O
. O
The O
servants O
seemed O
very O
busy O
with O
|
     | O
preparations O
for O
breakfast O
  O
but O
good O
- O
naturedly O
, O
though O
hastily O
, O
told O
him O
to O
step O
in O
, O
and O
they O
|
     | O
could O
soon O
let O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON
know O
he O
was O
there O
. O
So O
he O
was O
ushered O
into O
a O
kitchen O
hung O
round O
with O
|
     | O
glittering O
tins O
, O
where O
a O
roaring O
fire O
burnt O
merrily O
, O
and O
where O
numbers O
of O
utensils O
hung O
round O
, O
|
     | O
at O
whose O
nature O
and O
use O
Wilson B-ORG
amused O
himself O
by O
guessing O
. O
Meanwhile O
, O
the O
servants O
bustled O
to O
|
     | O
and O
fro O
  O
an O
out O
- O
door O
man O
- O
servant O
came O
in O
for O
orders O
, O
and O
sat O
down O
near O
Wilson B-ORG
  O
the O
cook O
broiled O
|
     | O
steaks O
, O
and O
the O
kitchen O
- O
maid O
toasted O
bread O
, O
and O
boiled O
eggs O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
coffee O
steamed O
upon O
the O
fire O
, O
and O
altogether O
the O
odours O
were O
so O
mixed O
and O
appetising O
, O
|
     | O
that O
Wilson B-ORG
began O
to O
yearn O
for O
food O
to O
break O
his O
fast O
, O
which O
had O
lasted O
since O
dinner O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
|
     | O
before O
. O
If O
the O
servants O
had O
known O
this O
, O
they O
would O
have O
willingly O
given O
him O
meat O
and O
bread O
in O
|
     | O
abundance O
  O
but O
they O
were O
like O
the O
rest O
of O
us O
, O
and O
not O
feeling O
hunger O
themselves O
, O
forgot O
it O
was O
|
     | O
possible O
another O
might O
. O
So O
Wilson B-PERSON
's O
craving O
turned O
to O
sickness O
, O
while O
they O
chattered O
on O
, O
making O

     | O
the O

we O

And O
she O

crying O

the O
poor O

  | O
It O
was O
agreed O

  O

by O
a B-DATE

he O

Would O
Mrs. O

The O
latter O
brightened O
up O
as O
she O
urged O
this O

     | O
plan O
  O
but O
no O
! O
where O
the O
poor O
, O
fondly O
loved O

were O

there O
would O
the O
mourner O
be O
  O
and O
all O

     | O
that O
they O
could O
do O
was O
to O
make O
her O
as O
comfortable O
as O
their O
funds O
would O
allow O
, O

to O
beg O

look O

say O

So O
she O
was O
left O
alone O
with O

they O

     | O
went O

he O

To O

Miss O

complete O

that O

  O
but O
it O
was O
true O

     | O
enough O
that O
Mary B-PERSON
did O
not O
mind O
what O
she O
was O
about O
  O
she O
was O
too O
busy O
planning O

her O

spunged O

turned O

lengthened O
into O

something O

decent O
mourning O
for O

And O
when O

at O
night B-TIME
( O
though O
it O
was O

     | O
very O

, O
she O
set O
to O
work O
at O
once O
, O
and O

     | O
was O
so O
busy O
, O
and O
so O
glad O
over O
her O
task O
, O
that O
she O
had O
, O
every O
now O

then O
, O
to O
check O
herself O

Mary B-PERSON
listened O
with O
saddened O

to O
the O

contrast O
which O
such O
woeful O

     | O

She O
blamed O

up O

with O

to O
the O

She O

wrapped O
round O

But O
just O
now O
he O
hardly O
saw O

he O
went O
straight O
up O
to O
Alice B-PERSON
, O

     | O
and O
asked O
how O
the O
little O
chaps O
were O
. O
They O
had O
been O
a O
shade O
better O
at O
dinner O

and O
he O
had O

     | O
been O
working O
away O
through O
the B-TIME
long I-TIME
afternoon I-TIME

far O
into O
the B-TIME

, O
in O
the O
belief O
that O
they O

     | O
had O
taken O
the O
turn O

He O
had O
stolen O
out O
during O
the B-TIME
half I-TIME

hour I-TIME
allowed O
at O
the O
works O
for O

to O
buy O

     | O
them O
an O
orange O
or O
two B-CARDINAL

which O
now O
puffed O
out O
his O
jacket O
- O
pocket O
. O
| 
  | O
He O
would O
make O
his O
aunt O
speak O
  O
he O
would O
not O
understand O
her O
shakes O
of O
the O
head O

fast O

     | O
coursing O

Jem B-PERSON
went O
to O
the O
cupboard O
, O
and O
quietly O
extricated O
from O
his O
pocket O
the O
oranges O
he O
had O
bought O
. O

     | O
But O
he O
stayed O
long O
there O
, O
and O
at O
last O
his O
sturdy O
frame O
shook O
with O
his O
strong O
agony O
. O
The O
two B-CARDINAL
|
     | O
women O
were O
frightened O
, O
as O
women O
always O
are O
, O
on O
witnessing O
a O
man O
's O
overpowering O
grief O

They O

     | O
cried O
afresh O
in O
company O
. O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
heart O
melted O
within O
her O
as O
she O
witnessed O
Jem B-PERSON
's O
sorrow O
, O
and O
she O
|
     | O
stepped O
gently O
up O
to O
the O
corner O
where O
he O
stood O
, O
with O
his O
back O
turned O
to O
them O
, O
and O
putting O
her O
|
     | O
hand O
softly O
on O
his O
arm O
, O
said O
, O
| 
  | O
" O
Oh O
, O
Jem B-PERSON
, O
do O

give O
way O

I O
can O
not O
bear O
to O
see O
you O

" O
| 
  | O
Jem B-PERSON
felt O
a O
strange O
leap O
of O
joy O
in O
his O
heart O
, O
and O
knew O
the O
power O
she O
had O
of O
comforting O
him O
. O
He O
|
     | O
did O
not O
speak O
, O
as O
though O
fearing O
to O
destroy O
by O
sound O
or O
motion O
the O
happiness O
of O
that O
moment O
, O
|
     | O
when O
her O
soft O
hand O
's O
touch O
thrilled O
through O
his O
frame O
, O
and O
her O
silvery O
voice O
was O
whispering O

     | O
tenderness O
in O
his O
ear O
. O
Yes O
! O
it O
might O
be O
very O
wrong O
  O
he O
could O
almost O
hate O
himself O
for O
it O
  O
with O
|
     | O
death O
and O
woe O
so O
surrounding O
him O
, O
it O
yet O
was O
happiness O
, O
was O
bliss O
, O
to O
be O
so O
spoken O
to O
by O

" O
Do O

Jem B-PERSON
, O
please O
do O
n't O

whispered O
she O
again O
, O
believing O
that O
his O
silence O
was O
only O
another O

     | O
form O
of O
grief O
. O

He O
could O
not O
contain O
himself O

He O
took O
her O
hand O
in O
his O
firm O
yet O
trembling O
grasp O
, O
and O
said O
, O
in O
|
     | O
tones O
that O
instantly O
produced O
a O
revulsion O
in O
her O
mood O
, O
| 
  | O
" O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
I O
almost O
loathe O
myself O

I O

not O

up O
this B-TIME

know O

was O
right O
there O

But O
as O
he O
turned O
to O
catch O
a O
look O
at O
her O
sweet O
face O
, O
he O
saw O

     | O
that O
it O
expressed O
unfeigned O
distress O
, O
almost O
amounting O
to O
vexation O
  O
a O
dread O
of O
him O

that O
he O

     | O
thought O

let O
her O

up O

mechanically O

the O
remainder O

not O

remained O
up O

stairs O
until O
after O
the O
early O
dawn O

     | O
showed O

down O

afterwards O

made O
her O

     | O
acquaintance O

He O
was O

to O
himself O
, O
quite O
infatuated O

     | O
by O

and O
was O
restless O
each O
day O

the O
time O
came O
when O
he O
had O

chance O

, O
more O

     | O
than O
a O
chance O

. O
There O
was O
something O
of O
keen O
practical O
shrewdness O
about O
her O
, O
which O
|
     | O
contrasted O
very O
bewitchingly O
with O
the O
simple O
, O
foolish O
, O
unworldly O
ideas O
she O
had O
picked O
up O
from O
|
     | O
the O
romances O
which O
Miss O
Simmonds B-PERSON
' O
young O

were O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
recommending O
to O
each O

     | O
other O
. O
| 
  | O
Yes O
! O
Mary B-PERSON
was O
ambitious O
, O
and O
did O
not O
favour O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON
the O
less O
because O
he O
was O
rich O
and O
a O
|
     | O
gentleman O
. O
The O
old O
leaven O
, O
infused O
years B-DATE
ago I-DATE
by O
her O
aunt O
Esther B-PERSON
, O
fermented O
in O
her O
little O
bosom O
, O
|
     | O
and O
perhaps O
all O
the O
more O
, O
for O
her O
father O
's O
aversion O
to O
the O
rich O

the O
gentle O
. O
Such O
is O
the O

     | O
contrariness O
of O
the O
human O
heart O

from O

So O
Mary B-PERSON
dwelt O
upon O
and O
enjoyed O
the O
idea O
of O
some B-DATE
day I-DATE
becoming O
a O
lady O
, O

     | O
and O
doing O
all O
the O
elegant O
nothings O
appertaining O
to O
ladyhood O
. O
It O
was O
a O
comfort O
to O
her O
, O
when O
|
     | O
scolded O
by O
Miss O
Simmonds B-PERSON
, O
to O
think O
of O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
when O
she O
would O
drive O
up O
to O
the O
door O
in O
her O

     | O

, O
to O
order O
her O
gowns O
from O
the O
hasty O
tempered O
yet O
kind O
dressmaker O
. O
It O
was O
a O
pleasure O
to O
|
     | O
her O
to O
hear O
the O
general O
admiration O
of O
the O

to O

of O
the O
time O
when O

should O
ride O

     | O
and O
walk O
with O

But O
the O

the O
holiest O

that O
which O
in O

now O
oppressed O
with O

and O
always O
a O

How O

that O

It O
was O
a O
bad O
beginning O

that O
Mary B-PERSON
saw O
him O
some O
minutes O
before O
he O

     | O
came O
into O
her O
father O

She O
was O
sitting O
at O

dresser O
, O
with O
the O
little O

     | O
window O

drawn O

in O
the O
intervals O
of O

     | O
reading O
her O
Bible B-WORK_OF_ART
, O
which O
lay O
open O
before O
her O

So O
she O
watched O
all O
the O
greeting O
a O
friend O
gave O
|
     | O
Jem B-PERSON
  O
she O
saw O
the O
face O
of O
condolence O
, O
the O
sympathetic O
shake O
of O
the O
hand O
, O
and O
had O
time O
to O
arrange O

     | O
her O
own O
face O
and O
manner O
before O
Jem B-PERSON
came O
in O
, O
which O
he O
did O
, O
as O
if O
he O
had O
eyes O
for O
no O
one O
but O
her O
|
     | O
father O
, O
who O
sat O
smoking O
his O
pipe O
by O
the O
fire O
, O
while O
he O
read O
an O
old O
" O

borrowed O

     | O
from O
a O
neighbouring O
public O

house O
. O
| 
  | O
Then O
he O
turned O
to O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
who O
, O
he O
felt O
by O
the O
sure O
instinct O
of O
love O
, O
by O
which O
almost O
his O
body O
|
     | O
thought O
, O
was O
present O
. O
Her O
hands O
were O
busy O
adjusting O
her O
dress O
  O
a O
forced O
and O
unnecessary O
|
     | O
movement O
Jem B-PERSON
could O
not O
help O
thinking O
. O
Her O
accost O
was O
quiet O
and O
friendly O
, O
if O
grave O
  O
she O
felt O
|
     | O
that O
she O
reddened O
like O
a O
rose O
, O
and O
wished O
she O
could O
prevent O
it O
, O
while O
Jem B-PERSON
wondered O
if O
her O
|
     | O
blushes O
arose O
from O
fear O
, O
or O
anger O
, O
or O
love O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
was O
very O
cunning O
, O
I O
am O
afraid O
. O
She O
pretended O
to O
read O
diligently O
, O
and O
not O
to O
listen O
to O
a O
|
     | O
word O
that O
was O
said O
, O
while O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
she O
heard O
all O
sounds O
, O
even O
to O
Jem B-PERSON
's O
long O
, O
deep O
sighs O
, O
which O
|
     | O
wrung O
her O
heart O
. O
At O
last O
she O
took O
up O
her O
Bible B-WORK_OF_ART
, O
and O
as O
if O
their O
conversation O
disturbed O
her O
, O
|
     | O
went O
up O
- O
stairs O
to O
her O
little O
room O
. O
And O
she O
had O
scarcely O
spoken O
a O
word O
to O
Jem B-PERSON
  O
scarcely O
looked O
|
     | O
at O
him O
  O
never O
noticed O
his O
beautiful O
sweet O
Nancy B-PERSON
, O
which O
only O
awaited O
her O
least O
word O
of O
praise O
to O

be O
hers O
! O
He O
did O
not O
know O
— O
that O
pang B-GPE
was O
spared O
— O
that O
in O
her O
little O
dingy O

, O
stood O
a O
white O

filled O

They O
were O
the O

go O

fairly O

But O
one B-CARDINAL

I O
thought O
I O

Th O

" O

  | O
Jem B-PERSON
was O
pondering O
Mary B-PERSON

the O
pause O
made O
him O
aware O
he O
ought O
to O
utter O
some O
civil O

     | O
listening O
noise O
  O
so O
he O
said O

" O
Very O

" O

  | O
" O
Ay O

it O

there O

Yo O
may O
take O
my O

     | O
word O
for O
that O

Jem B-PERSON

" O

  | O
Jem B-PERSON
was O
very O
willing O

take O
it O
, O
but O
did O
not O
express O
the O
curiosity O
he O
should O
have O
done O
. O
So O
|
     | O
John B-PERSON

thought O
he O
'd O
try O
another O

" O
Working O

" O

Still O
Jem B-PERSON
was O
not O
curious O

He O
gave O
up O
hope O

by O
her O
own O
good O

the O
next O
best O
thing O
would O
be O
, O
to O
be O
alone O
to O
think O
of O
her O

So O
, O
muttering O
something O
which O
he O

     | O
meant O
to O
serve O
as O
an O
excuse O
for O
his O
sudden O
departure O
, O
he O
hastily O
wished O
John B-PERSON
good I-PERSON
afternoon I-PERSON

     | O
and O
left O
him O

For O

And O
yet O
even O

they O
could O
only O

present O
an O

Even O

forced O

the O
real O

     | O
causes O
of O
the O

  O
the O
whole O

of O
so O
complicated O

that O
it O
became O
next O

It O
need O

bad O

     | O
feeling O

     | O
privation O

The O
indigence O

induced O
a O
suspicion O

many O

were O
in O

their O
prostration O

The O
most O

enduring O
evil O
that O
arose O
out O
of O
the O

     | O
period O
of O
commercial O
depression O
to O
which O
I O
refer O

was O
this O
feeling O
of O
alienation O
between O
the O

     | O
different O
classes O
of O

It O
is O
so O
impossible O
to O
describe O

even O
faintly O
to O

the O

prevailed O

that O
I O
will O
not O

it O

yet O

     | O
I O
think O
again O
that O
surely O
, O
in O
a O
Christian B-NORP

it O
was O
not O

the O
more O

|
     | O
In O
many O

the O

wept O
first B-ORDINAL

and O
then O
they O
cursed O

Their O
vindictive O

     | O
exhibited O
themselves O
in O
rabid O

And O
when O
I O

of O

An O
idea O

They O
could O
not O

     | O
believe O
that O

they O
rather O
chose O

think O
it O
possible O
that O

could O
voluntarily O
assume O
the O

the O

a O

One B-CARDINAL
of O

that O

during O
her O

There O
was O
something O
crooked O
in O
her O
conscience O
after O
all O
  O
|
     | O
for O
this O
very O
resolution O
seemed O
an O
acknowledgment O
that O
it O
was O
wrong O
to O
meet O
him O
at O
any O
time O
  O
|
     | O
and O
yet O
she O
had O
brought O
herself O
to O
think O
her O
conduct O
quite O
innocent O
and O
proper O
, O
for O
although O
|
     | O
unknown O
to O
her O
father O
, O
and O
certain O
, O
even O
did O
he O
know O
it O
, O
to O
fail O
of O
obtaining O
his O
sanction O
, O
she O

     | O
esteemed O
her O
love O

meetings O
with O
Mr. O

as O
sure O
to O
end O
in O
her O

good O

happiness O

     | O
But O
now O
that O
he O
was O
away O
, O
she O
would O
do O
nothing O
that O
he O
would O
disapprove O
of O
  O
no O
, O
not O
even O
though O
|
     | O
it O
was O
for O
his O
own O
good O
in O
the O
end O

Now O
, O
amongst O
Miss O
Simmonds B-PERSON
' O
young O

was O
one O
who O
had O
been O
from O
the O
beginning O
a O
confidant O

     | O
in O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
love O
affair O
, O
made O
so O
by O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON
himself O
. O
He O
had O
felt O
the O
necessity O
of O
some B-CARDINAL
third I-CARDINAL

     | O
person O
to O
carry O
letters O
and O
messages O
, O
and O
to O
plead O
his O
cause O
when O
he O
was O
absent O
. O
In O
a O
girl O
|
     | O
named O
Sally B-PERSON
Leadbitter I-PERSON
he O
had O
found O
a O
willing O
advocate O
. O
She O
would O
have O
been O
willing O
to O
have O
|
     | O
embarked O
in O
a O
love O
- O
affair O
herself O
( O
especially O
a O
clandestine O
one O
) O
, O
for O
the O
mere O
excitement O
of O
|
     | O
the O
thing O
  O
but O
her O
willingness O
was O
strengthened O
by O
sundry O
half B-CARDINAL
- O
sovereigns O
, O
which O
from O
time O
to O
|
     | O
time O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON
bestowed O
upon O
her O
. O
| 
  | O
Sally B-PERSON
Leadbitter I-PERSON
was O
vulgar O
- O
minded O
to O
the O
last O
degree O
  O
never O
easy O
unless O
her O
talk O
was O
of O
love O
|
     | O
and O
lovers O
  O
in O
her O
eyes O
it O
was O
an O
honour O
to O
have O
had O
a O
long O
list O
of O
wooers O
. O
So O
constituted O
, O
it O
|
     | O
was O
a O
pity O
that O
Sally B-PERSON
herself O
was O
but O
a O
plain O
, O
red O
- O
haired O
, O
freckled O
girl O
  O
never O
likely O
, O
one B-CARDINAL

     | O
would O
have O
thought O
, O
to O
become O
a O
heroine O
on O
her O
own O
account O
. O
But O
what O
she O
lacked O
in O
beauty O
she O
|
     | O
tried O
to O
make O
up O
for O
by O
a O
kind O
of O
witty O
boldness O
, O
which O
gave O
her O
what O
her O
betters O
would O
have O
|
     | O
called O
piquancy O
. O
Considerations O
of O
modesty O
or O
propriety O
never O
checked O
her O
utterance O
of O
a O
good O
|
     | O
thing O
. O
She O
had O
just O
talent O
enough O
to O
corrupt O
others O
. O
Her O
very O
good O
- O
nature O
was O
an O
evil O

     | O
influence O
. O
They O
could O
not O
hate O
one O
who O
was O
so O
kind O
  O
they O
could O
not O
avoid O
one O
who O
was O
so O
willing O

     | O
to O
shield O
them O
from O
scrapes O
by O
any O
exertion O
of O
her O
own O
  O
whose O
ready O

would O
at O

up O

their O

The O
Jews B-NORP

asked O

" O

not O

So O
she O

     | O
wisely O
paused O
in O
their O
delivery O
, O

said O
in O
a O
more O

with O
the O

the O
details O

that O

weighed O
down O
her O

heart O

She O
pressed O
his O
hand O
with O
silent O
sympathy O

She O
did O
not O
know O
what O
to O
say O

and O
was O
so O

     | O
afraid O
of O
speaking O
wrongly O
, O
that O
she O
was O
silent O
. O

when O
his O
attitude O

remained O
unchanged O

for O
more B-CARDINAL

an O

no O

now O

through O

there O
are O

     | O
exceptions O

and O
Barton B-ORG
formed O
one O
. O
He O
had O
removed O

his O
present O
house O
just O
after O
the O
last O
bad O

     | O
times O
, O
when O
little O
Tom B-PERSON
had O
sickened O
and O
died O
. O
He O
had O
then O
thought O
the O
bustle O
of O
a O
removal O
would O
|
     | O
give O
his O
poor O
stunned O
wife O
something O
to O
do O
, O

he O
had O
taken O
more O
interest O

the O
details O
of O

     | O
the O
proceeding O
than O
he O
otherwise O
would O

the O
hope O

calling O
her O
forth O
to O
action O

again O

he O
seemed O
to O
know O
every O
brass O

driven O
up O
for O
her O
convenience O

, O
in O
his O
deep O

against O

     | O
after O
his O
wife O

death O

he O
had O
torn O
out O
of O
the O
wall O

cast O
into O
the O
street O

It O
would O
be O
hard O

     | O
work O
to O
leave O

seemed O

the O
happy O
days O
of O

     | O

But O
he O

bad O

It O
was O
wrenching O
up O

for O
it O
would O

But O
by O
degrees O
the O

were O

the O
odd O

He O

did O
not O
ask O

she O
saw O

he O
took O

     | O
it O
better O
to O
propitiate O

though O
they O
had O
large O

so O
thought O
John B-PERSON

. O
With O
him O
need O
was O

     | O
right O

" O
Give O
it O
to O
Tom B-PERSON
Darbyshire I-PERSON

" O
he O
said O

" O
He O

more O
claim O

it O

with O
his O
seven B-CARDINAL
children O

" O

  | O
Now O
Tom B-PERSON
Darbyshire I-PERSON
was O
, O
in O
his O
listless O
, O
grumbling O
way O
, O
a O
backbiting O
enemy O
of O
John B-PERSON
Barton I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
. O
|
     | O
And O
he O
knew O
it O
  O
but O
he O
was O
not O
to O
be O
influenced O
by O
that O
in O
a O
matter O
like O
this O
. O
| 
  | O
Mary B-PERSON
went O
early O
to O
her O
work O
  O
but O
her O
cheery O
laugh O
over O
it O
was O
now O
missed O
by O
the O
other O
girls O
. O
|
     | O
Her O
mind O
wandered O
over O
the O
present O
distress O
, O
and O
then O
settled O
, O
as O
she O
stitched O
, O
on O
the O
visions O
|
     | O
of O
the O
future O
, O
where O
yet O
her O
thoughts O
dwelt O
more O
on O
the O
circumstances O
of O
ease O
, O
and O
the O
pomps O
|
     | O
and O
vanities O
awaiting O
her O
, O
than O
on O
the O
lover O
with O
whom O
she O
was O
to O
share O
them O
. O
Still O
she O
was O
not O
|
     | O
insensible O
to O
the O
pride O
of O
having O
attracted O
one O
so O
far O
above O
herself O
in O
station O
  O
not O
insensible O
|
     | O
to O
the O
secret O
pleasure O
of O
knowing O
that O
he O
, O
whom O
so O
many O
admired O
, O
had O
often O
said O
he O
would O
give O
|
     | O
any O
thing O
for O
one O
of O
her O
sweet O
smiles O
. O
Her O
love O
for O
him O
was O
a O
bubble O
, O
blown O
out O
of O
vanity O
  O
but O
|
     | O
it O
looked O
very O
real O
and O
very O
bright O
. O
Sally B-PERSON
Leadbitter I-PERSON
, O
meanwhile O
, O
keenly O
observed O
the O
signs O
of O
|
     | O
the O
times O
  O
she O
found O
out O
that O
Mary B-PERSON
had O
begun O
to O
affix O
a O
stern O
value O
to O
money O
as O
the O
" O
Purchaser O
|
     | O
of O
Life O
, O
" O
and O
many O
girls O
had O
been O
dazzled O
and O
lured O
by O
gold O
, O
even O
without O
the O
betraying O
love O
|
     | O
which O
she O
believed O
to O
exist O
in O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
heart O
. O
So O
she O
urged O
young O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON
, O
by O
representations O
|
     | O
of O
the O
want O
she O
was O
sure O
surrounded O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
to O
bring O
matters O
more O
to O
a O
point O
. O
But O
he O
had O
a O
kind O
|
     | O
of O
instinctive O
dread O
of O
hurting O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
pride O
of O
spirit O
, O
and O
durst O
not O
hint O
his O
knowledge O
in O
any O
|
     | O
way O
of O
the O
distress O
that O
many O
must O
be O
enduring O
. O
He O
felt O
that O
for O
the O
present O
he O
must O
still O
be O
|
     | O
content O
with O
stolen O
meetings O
and O
summer B-DATE
evening B-TIME
strolls O
, O
and O
the O
delight O
of O
pouring O
sweet O
|
     | O
honeyed O
words O
into O
her O
ear O
, O
while O
she O
listened O
with O
a O
blush O
and O
a O
smile O
that O
made O
her O
look O
|
     | O
radiant O
with O
beauty O
. O
No O
, O
he O
would O
be O
cautious O
in O
order O
to O
be O
certain O
  O
for O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
one B-CARDINAL
way O
or O
|
     | O
another O
, O
he O
must O
make O
his O
. O
He O
had O
no O
doubt O
of O
the O
effect O
of O
his O
own O
personal O
charms O
in O
the O
long O
|
     | O
run O
  O
for O
he O
knew O
he O
was O
handsome O
, O
and O
believed O
himself O
fascinating O
. O
| 
  | O
If O
he O
had O
known O
what O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
home O
was O
, O
he O
would O
not O
have O
been O
so O
much O
convinced O
of O
his O
|
     | O
increasing O
influence O
over O
her O
, O
by O
her O
being O
more O
and O
more O
ready O
to O
linger O
with O
him O
in O
the O
sweet O

     | O
summer B-DATE
air O

For O
when O
she O
returned O
for O
the B-TIME
night I-TIME
her O
father O
was O
often O
out O
, O
and O
the O
house O
wanted O

     | O
the O
cheerful O
look O
it O
had O
had O
in O
the B-DATE
days I-DATE
when O

brushes O
, O
black O

It O
was O
dingy O
and O
comfortless O
  O
for O
, O
of O
course O
, O
there O
was O
not O

     | O
even O
the O
dumb O
familiar O
home O

a O

And O
Margaret B-PERSON
, O
too O
, O
was O
now O
so O
often O
from O
home O
, O

     | O
singing O
at O
some O
of O
those O
grand O
places O

And O
Alice B-PERSON
  O
oh O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
wished O

never O
left O
her O

live O
at O
Ancoats O
with O
her O
sister O

in O

For O
in O
that O
matter O
Mary B-PERSON
felt O
very O
guilty O
  O
she O

     | O
had O
put O
off O
and O
put O
off O
going O
to O
see O
the O
widow O
after O
George B-PERSON

from O
dread O

giving O
him O
reason O

wished O
to O
be O
as O
intimate O
with O
him O
as O
formerly O
  O

     | O
and O
now O
she O
was O
so O
much O
ashamed O
of O
her O
delay O
that O
she O
was O
likely O
never O
to O
go O
at O
all O
. O

If O
her O
father O
was O
at O
home O
it O
was O
no O
better O
  O
indeed O
it O
was O
worse O

He O
seldom O
spoke O

less O
than O

     | O
ever O
  O
and O
often O
when O
he O
did O

they O
were O
sharp O

such O
as O
he O
had O
never O

her O

     | O

Her O
temper O
was O
high O

too O
, O
and O
her O
answers O
not O
over O

mild O
  O
and O
once O
in O
his O
passion O
he O

     | O
had O
even O
beaten O
her O

If O
Sally B-PERSON

had O

at O

would O
have O
been O
ready O

leave O
home O

She O
sat O
alone O
, O
after O
her O
father O
had O
flung O
out O
of O
|
     | O
the O
house O
, O
bitterly O
thinking O
on O
the B-DATE
days I-DATE
that O
were O
gone O
  O
angry O
with O
her O
own O
hastiness O

and O
|
     | O
believing O
that O
her O
father O
did O
not O
love O
her O
  O
striving O
to O
heap O
up O
one B-CARDINAL

thought O
on O
another O
. O
|
     | O
Who O
cared O
for O
her O
? O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON
might O
, O
but O
in O
this O
grief O
that O
seemed O
no O

Mother O
dead O
! O

     | O
Father O
so O
often O
angry O
, O
so O
lately O
cruel O
( O
for O
it O
was O
a O

and O
blistered O
and O
reddened O

     | O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
soft O
white O
skin O
with O
pain O
): O
and O
then O
her O
heart O
turned O
round O
, O
and O
she O
remembered O
with O
|
     | O
self O
- O
reproach O
how O
provokingly O
she O
had O
looked O
and O
spoken O
, O
and O
how O
much O
her O
father O
had O
to O
bear O
  O
|
     | O
and O
oh O
, O
what O
a O
kind O
and O
loving O
parent O
he O
had O
been O
, O
till O
these B-DATE
days I-DATE
of O
trial O
. O
The O
remembrance O
of O
|
     | O
one B-CARDINAL
little O
instance O
of O
his O
fatherly O
love O
thronged O
after O
another O
into O
her O
mind O
, O
and O
she O
began O
to O
|
     | O
wonder O
how O
she O
could O
have O
behaved O
to O
him O
as O
she O
had O
done O
. O
| 
  | O
Then O
he O
came O
home O
  O
and O
but O
for O
very O
shame O
she O
would O
have O
confessed O
her O
penitence O
in O
words O
. O
|
     | O
But O
she O
looked O
sullen O
, O
from O
her O
effort O
to O
keep O
down O
emotion O
  O
and O
for O
some O
time O
her O
father O
did O
|
     | O
not O
know O
how O
to O
begin O
to O
speak O
. O
At O
length O
he O
gulped O
down O
pride O
, O
and O
said O
: O
| 
  | O
" O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
I O
'm O
not O
above O
saying O
I O
'm O
very O
sorry O
I O
beat O
thee O
. O
Thou B-PERSON
wert O
a O
bit O
aggravating O
, O
and O
I O
'm O

     | O
not O

But O
it O
were O
wrong O

I O
'll O
try O
never O
to O
lay O
hands O
on O
thee O
again O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
So O
he O
held O
out O
his O
arms O
, O
and O
in O
many O
tears O
she O
told O
him O
her O
repentance O
for O
her O
fault O
. O
He O
|
     | O
never O
struck O
her O
again O
. O
| 
  | O
Still O
, O
he O
often O
was O
angry O
. O
But O
that O
was O
almost O
better O
than O
being O
silent O
. O
Then O
he O
sat O
near O
the O
|
     | O
fire O
- O
place O
( O
from O
habit O
) O
, O
smoking O

or O
chewing O
opium O

Oh O
, O
how O
Mary B-PERSON
loathed O
that O
smell O
! O
And O
in O
the O
|
     | O
dusk O
, O
just O
before O
it O
merged O
into O
the O
short O
summer O
night O
, O
she O
had O
learned O
to O
look O
with O
dread O
|
     | O
towards O
the O
window O
, O
which O
now O
her O
father O
would O
have O
kept O
uncurtained O
  O
for O
there O
were O
not O
seldom O

     | O
seen O
sights O
which O
haunted O
her O
in O
her O
dreams O

Strange O
faces O
of O
pale O
men O
, O
with O
dark O
glaring O
eyes O
, O
|
     | O
peered O
into O
the O
inner O
darkness O
, O
and O
seemed O
desirous O
to O
ascertain O
if O
her O
father O
were O
at O
home O

Or O
|
     | O
a O
hand O

( O
the O

was O
put O
within O
the O

and O
beckoned O
him O
away O
. O
He O
always O

     | O
went O
. O
And O
once O
or O
twice O
, O
when O
Mary B-PERSON
was O
in O

she O
heard O
men O

below O

in O
earnest O
, O

     | O
whispered O

While O

struck O
fresh O

heavy O
on O
Mary B-PERSON

heart O
, O
her O
father O
|
     | O
startled O
her O
out O
of O
a O
reverie O
one O
evening O
, O
by O
asking O
her O
when O
she O
had O
been O
to O
see O
Jane B-PERSON
Wilson I-PERSON
. O
|
     | O
From O
his O
manner O
of O

she O
was O
made O
aware O

Now O
, O
however O
, O
he O
gruffly O
told O
her O
to O
go O
next B-DATE

     | O
without O
fail O

added O
some O

" O
Pooh O

who O
had O
not O
heard O
her O
sister O

last O
burst O
of O

still O
running O
on O

all O

off O

that O
he O
does O

" O
| 
  | O
Mary B-PERSON
went O
very O
red O
, O
and O
looked O
annoyed O
, O
although O
there O
was O
a O
secret O
spring O
of O
joy O
deep O
down O

     | O
in O
her O
heart O
, O
at O
hearing O
Jem B-PERSON
so O
spoken O
of O

But O
his O
mother O
only O
saw O
the O
annoyed O
look O
, O
and O
was O
|
     | O
piqued O
accordingly O
. O
She O
was O
not O
over O
and O
above O
desirous O
that O
her O
son O
should O
marry O
. O
His O
presence O
|
     | O
in O
the O
house O
seemed O
a O
relic O
of O
happier O
times O
, O
and O
she O
had O
some O
little O
jealousy O
of O
his O
future O
|
     | O
wife O
, O
whoever O
she O
might O
be O
. O
Still O
she O
could O
not O
bear O
any O
one O
not O
to O
feel O
gratified O
and O
|
     | O
flattered O
by O
Jem B-PERSON
's O
preference O
, O
and O
full O
well O
she O
knew O
how O
above O
all O
others O
he O
preferred O
Mary B-PERSON
. O
|
     | O
Now O
she O
had O
never O
thought O
Mary B-PERSON
good O
enough O
for O
Jem B-PERSON
, O
and O
her O
late O
neglect O
in O
coming O
to O
see O
her O
|
     | O
still O
rankled O
a O
little O
in O
her O
breast O
. O
So O
she O
determined O
to O
invent O
a O
little O
, O
in O
order O
to O
do O
away O

     | O
with O
any O
idea O

might O
have O
that O

our O

many O

By O
an O
effort O

keep O
down O

vexation O

glad O

Her O
words O
irritated O
her O
  O
perhaps O
not O
the O
less O

because O

wanted O

speak O
to O
Alice B-PERSON

Mrs. O

Unceasing O

Barton B-PERSON
returned O
home O
after O
his O
encounter O
with O
Esther B-PERSON
, O
uneasy O
and O
dissatisfied O
. O
He O
had O
said O
no O

     | O
more O
than O
he O
had O
been O
planning O
to O
say O
for O
years B-DATE
, O
in O
case O
she O
was O
ever O
thrown O
in O
his O
way O
, O
in O
the O
|
     | O
character O
in O
which O
he O
felt O
certain O
he O
should O
meet O
her O
. O
He O
believed O
she O
deserved O
it O
all O
, O
and O
yet O
|
     | O
he O
now O
wished O
he O
had O
not O
said O
it O
. O
Her O
look O
, O
as O
she O
asked O
for O
mercy O
, O
haunted O
him O
through O
his O
|
     | O
broken O
and O
disordered O
sleep O
  O
her O
form O
, O
as O
he O
last O
saw O
her O
, O
lying O
prostrate O
in O
helplessness O
, O
|
     | O
would O
not O
be O
banished O
from O
his O
dreams O
. O
He O
sat O
up O
in O
bed O
to O
try O
and O
dispel O
the O
vision O
. O
Now O
, O
too O
|
     | O
late O
, O
his O
conscience O
smote O
him O
for O
his O
harshness O
. O
It O
would O
have O
been O
all O
very O
well O
, O
he O
thought O
, O
|
     | O
to O
have O
said O
what O
he O
did O
, O
if O
he O
had O
added O
some O
kind O
words O
, O
at O
last O
. O
He O
wondered O
if O
his O
dead O
|
     | O
wife O
was O
conscious O
of O
that O
night B-TIME
's O
occurrence O
  O
and O
he O
hoped O
not O
, O
for O
with O
her O
love O
for O
Esther B-PERSON
|
     | O
he O
believed O
it O
would O
embitter O
Heaven O
to O
have O
seen O
her O
so O
degraded O
and O
repulsed O
. O
For O
he O
now O
|
     | O
recalled O
her O
humility O
, O
her O
tacit O
acknowledgment O
of O
her O
lost O
character O
  O
and O
he O
began O
to O
marvel O
|
     | O
if O
there O
was O
power O
in O
the O
religion O
he O
had O
often O
heard O
of O
, O
to O
turn O
her O
from O
her O
ways O
. O
He O
felt O
|
     | O
that O
no O
earthly O
power O
that O
he O
knew O
of O
could O
do O
it O
, O
but O
there O
glimmered O
on O
his O
darkness O
the O
idea O
|
     | O
that O
religion O
might O
save O
her O
. O
Still O
, O
where O
to O
find O
her O
again O
? O
In O
the O
wilderness O
of O
a O
large O
|
     | O
town O
, O
where O
to O
meet O
with O
an O
individual O
of O
so O
little O
value O
or O
note O
to O
any O
? O
| 
  | O
And O
evening B-TIME
after O
evening B-TIME
he O
paced O
those O
streets O
in O
which O
he O
had O
heard O
her O
footsteps O
|
     | O
following O
him O
, O
peering O
under O
every O
fantastic O
, O
discreditable O
bonnet O
, O
in O
the O
hopes O
of O
once O
more O
|
     | O
meeting O
Esther B-PERSON
, O
and O
addressing O
her O
in O
a O
far O
different O
manner O
from O
what O
he O
had O
done O
before O
. O
But O
|
     | O
he O
returned O
, O
night B-TIME
after O
night B-TIME
, O
disappointed O
in O
his O
search O
, O
and O
at O
last O
gave O
it O
up O
in O
despair O
, O
|
     | O
and O
tried O
to O
recall O
his O
angry O
feelings O
towards O
her O
, O
in O
order O
to O
find O
relief O
from O
his O
present O
|
     | O
self O
- O
reproach O
. O
| 
  | O
He O
often O
looked O
at O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
and O
wished O
she O
were O
not O
so O
like O
her O
aunt O
, O
for O
the O
very O
bodily O
|
     | O
likeness O
seemed O
to O
suggest O
the O
possibility O
of O
a O
similar O
likeness O
in O
their O
fate O
  O
and O
then O
this O
|
     | O
idea O
enraged O
his O
irritable O
mind O
, O
and O
he O
became O
suspicious O
and O
anxious O
about O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
conduct O
. O
Now O
|
     | O
hitherto O
she O
had O
been O
so O
remarkably O
free O
from O
all O
control O
, O
and O
almost O
from O
all O
inquiry O
|
     | O
concerning O
her O
actions O
, O
that O
she O
did O
not O
brook O
this O
change O
in O
her O
father O
's O
behaviour O
very O
well O
. O
|
     | O
Just O
when O
she O
was O
yielding O
more O
than O
ever O
to O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON
's O
desire O
of O
frequent O
meetings O
, O
it O
was O
|
     | O
hard O
to O
be O
so O
questioned O
concerning O
her B-TIME
hours I-TIME
of O
leaving O
off O
work O
, O
whether O
she O
had O
come O
|
     | O
straight O
home O
, O
& O
amp c O
. O
She O
could O
not O
tell O
lies O
  O
though O
she O
could O
conceal O
much O
if O
she O
were O
not O
|
     | O
questioned O
. O
So O
she O
took O
refuge O
in O
obstinate O
silence O
, O
alleging O
as O
a O
reason O
for O
it O
her O
|
     | O
indignation O
at O
being O
so O
cross O
- O
examined O
. O
This O
did O
not O
add O
to O
the O
good O
feeling O
between O
father O
and O
|
     | O
daughter O
, O
and O
yet O
they O
dearly O
loved O
each O
other O
  O
and O
in O
the O
minds O
of O
each O
, O
one B-CARDINAL
principal O
reason O
|
     | O
for O
maintaining O
such O
behaviour O
as O
displeased O
the O
other O
, O
was O
the O
believing O
that O
this O
conduct O
|
     | O
would O
insure O
that O
person O
's O
happiness O
. O
| 
  | O
Her O
father O
now O
began O
to O
wish O
Mary B-PERSON
were O
married O
. O
Then O
this O
terrible O
superstitious O
fear O
|
     | O
suggested O
by O
her O
likeness O
to O
Esther B-PERSON
would O
be O
done O
away O
with O
. O
He O
felt O
that O
he O
could O
not O
resume O
|
     | O
the O
reins O
he O
had O
once O
slackened O
. O
But O
with O
a O
husband O
it O
would O
be O
different O
. O
If O
Jem B-PERSON
Wilson I-PERSON
would O
|
     | O
but O
marry O
her O
! O
With O
his O
character O
for O
steadiness O
and O
talent O
! O
But O
he O
was O
afraid O
Mary B-PERSON
had O
|
     | O
slighted O
him O
, O
he O
came O
so O
seldom O
now O
to O
the O
house O
. O
He O
would O
ask O
her O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
what O
's O
come O
o'er O
thee O
and O
Jem B-PERSON
Wilson I-PERSON
? O
Yo O
were O
great O
friends O
at O
one B-CARDINAL
time O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Oh O
, O
folk O
say O
he O
's O
going O
to O
be O
married O
to O
Molly B-PERSON
Gibson I-PERSON
, O
and O
of O
course O
courting O
takes O
up O
a O
|
     | O
deal O
o O
' O
time O
, O
" O
answered O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
as O
indifferently O
as O
she O
could O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Thou'st O
played O
thy O
cards O
badly O
, O
then O
, O
" O
replied O
her O
father O
, O
in O
a O
surly O
tone O
. O
" O
At O
one B-CARDINAL
time O
he O
|
     | O
were O
desperate O
fond O
o O
' O
thee O
, O
or O
I O
'm O
much O
mistaken O
. O
Much O
fonder O
of O
thee O
than O
thou O
|
     | O
deservedst O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
That O
's O
as O
people O
think O
, O
" O
said O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
pertly O
, O
for O
she O
remembered O
that O
the B-TIME
very I-TIME
morning I-TIME
before O
|
     | O
she O
had O
met O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
sighed O
, O
and O
swore O
, O
and O
protested O
all O
manner O
of O
tender O
vows O
that O
|
     | O
she O
was O
the O
loveliest O
, O
sweetest O
, O
best O
, O
& O
amp c O
. O
And O
when O
she O
had O
seen O
him O
afterwards O
riding O
with O
|
     | O
one O
of O
his O
beautiful O
sisters O
, O
had O
he O
not O
evidently O
pointed O
her O
out O
as O
in O
some O
way O
or O
other O
an O
|
     | O
object O
worthy O
of O
attention O
and O
interest O
, O
and O
then O
lingered O
behind O
his O
sister O
's O
horse O
for O
a O
|
     | O
moment O
to O
kiss O
his O
hand O
repeatedly O
. O
So O
, O
as O
for O
Jem B-PERSON
Wilson I-PERSON
, O
she O
could O
whistle O
him O
down O
the O
|
     | O
wind O
. O
| 
  | O
But O
her O
father O
was O
not O
in O
the O
mood O
to O
put O
up O
with O
pertness O
, O
and O
he O
upbraided O
her O
with O
the O
|
     | O
loss O
of O
Jem B-PERSON
Wilson I-PERSON
till O
she O
had O
to O
bite O
her O
lips O
till O
the O
blood O
came O
, O
in O
order O
to O
keep O
down O
the O
|
     | O
angry O
words O
that O
would O
rise O
in O
her O
heart O
. O
At O
last O
her O
father O
left O
the O
house O
, O
and O
then O
she O
might O
|
     | O
give O
way O
to O
her O
passionate O
tears O
. O
| 
  | O
It O
so O
happened O
that O
Jem B-PERSON
, O
after O
much O
anxious O
thought O
, O
had O
determined O
that B-DATE
day I-DATE
to O
" O
put O
his O
fate O
|
     | O
to O
the O
touch O
, O
to O
win O
or O
lose O
it O
all O
. O
" O
He O
was O
in O
a O
condition O
to O
maintain O
a O
wife O
in O
comfort O
. O
It O
|
     | O
was O
true O
his O
mother O
and O
aunt O
must O
form O
part O
of O
the O
household O
  O
but O
such O
is O
not O
an O
uncommon O
case O

     | O
among O
the O
poor O
, O
and O
if O
there O
were O
the O
advantage O
of O
previous O
friendship O
between O
the O
parties O
, O
it O

     | O
was O
not O
, O

thought O
, O
an O
obstacle O
to O
matrimony O
. O
Both O
mother O
and O
aunt O
he O
believed O
would O
welcome O

     | O
Mary B-PERSON

And O
oh O
! O
what O
a O
certainty O
of O
happiness O
the O
idea O
of O
that O
welcome O
implied O
. O
| 
  | O
He O
had O
been O
absent O
and O
abstracted O
all B-DATE
day I-DATE
long O
with O
the O
thought O
of O
the O
coming O
event O
of O
the O
|
     | O
evening O
. O
He O
almost O
smiled O
at O
himself O
for O
his O
care O
in O
washing O
and O
dressing O
in O
preparation O
for O
|
     | O
his O
visit O
to O
Mary B-PERSON
. O
As O
if O
one B-CARDINAL
waistcoat O
or O
another O
could O
decide O
his O
fate O
in O
so O
passionately O

momentous O
a O
thing O

He O
believed O

only O
delayed O
before O
his O
little O
looking O
- O
glass O
for O
cowardice O
, O

     | O
for O
absolute O
fear O
of O
a O
girl O

He O
would O
try O
not O
to O
think O
so O
much O
about O
the O
affair O
, O

he O
thought O

the O
more O

  | O
Poor O

it O

" O
Come O
in O
, O

said O
Mary B-PERSON

as O
some O
one O
knocked O
at O
the O
door O
, O
while O
she O
sat O
sadly O
at O
her O
sewing O
, O

     | O
trying O
to O
earn O
a O
few O
pence O
by O
working O
over B-TIME
hours I-TIME
at O
some O
mourning O

Jem B-PERSON
entered O
, O
looking O
more O
awkward O

abashed O
than O
he O

did O
not O
ask O

after O

     | O
standing O
a B-TIME
minute I-TIME

he O
sat O
down O
near O
her O

" O
Is O
your O
father O
at O
home O

said O
he O
, O
by O
way O
of O
making O
an O
opening O
, O
for O
she O
seemed O

     | O
determined O

went O
on O

away O

did O
not O
|
     | O
desire O
her O
for O
a O
daughter O
- O
in O
- O
law O
: O
while O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON
was O
rich O
, O
and O
prosperous O
, O
and O
gay O
, O
and O
( O
she O
|
     | O
believed O
) O
would O
place O
her O
in O
all O
circumstances O
of O
ease O
and O
luxury O
, O
where O
want O
could O
never O
come O
. O
|
     | O
What O
were O
these O
hollow O
vanities O
to O
her O
, O
now O
she O
had O
discovered O
the O
passionate O
secret O
of O
her O
|
     | O
soul O
? O
She O
felt O
as O
if O
she O
almost O
hated O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
decoyed O
her O
with O
his O
baubles O
. O
She O
now O
|
     | O
saw O
how O
vain O
, O
how O
nothing O
to O
her O
, O
would O
be O
all O
gaieties O
and O
pomps O
, O
all O
joys O
and O
pleasures O
, O
|
     | O
unless O
she O
might O
share O
them O
with O
Jem B-PERSON
  O
yes O
, O
with O
him O
she O
harshly O
rejected O
so O
short O
a O
time O
ago O
. O
|
     | O
If O
he O
were O
poor O
, O
she O
loved O
him O
all O
the O
better O
. O
If O
his O
mother O
did O
think O
her O
unworthy O
of O
him O
, O
|
     | O
what O
was O
it O
but O
the O
truth O
, O
as O
she O
now O
owned O
with O
bitter O
penitence O
. O
She O
had O
hitherto O
been O
|
     | O
walking O
in O
grope O
- O
light O
towards O
a O
precipice O
  O
but O
in O
the O
clear O
revelation O
of O
that B-TIME
past I-TIME
hour I-TIME
, O
she O
|
     | O
saw O
her O
danger O
, O
and O
turned O
away O
resolutely O
and O
for O
ever O
. O
| 
  | O
That O
was O
some O
comfort O
: O
I O
mean O
her O
clear O
perception O
of O
what O
she O
ought O
not O
to O
do O
  O
of O
what O
no O
|
     | O
luring O
temptation O
should O
ever O
again O
induce O
her O
to O
hearken O
to O
. O
How O
she O
could O
best O
undo O
the O
wrong O
|
     | O
she O
had O
done O
to O
Jem B-PERSON
and O
herself O
by O
refusing O
his O
love O
, O
was O
another O
anxious O
question O
. O
She O
wearied O
|
     | O
herself O
with O
proposing O
plans O
, O
and O
rejecting O
them O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
was O
roused O
to O
a O
consciousness O
of O
time O
by O
hearing O
the O
neighbouring O
church O
clock O
strike O
|
     | O
twelve B-CARDINAL
. O
Her O
father O
she O
knew O
might O
be O
expected O
home O
any B-TIME
minute I-TIME
, O
and O
she O
was O
in O
no O
mood O
for O
a O
|
     | O
meeting O
with O
him O
. O
So O
she O
hastily O
gathered O
up O
her O
work O
, O
and O
went O
to O
her O
own O
little O
bed O
- O
room O
, O
|
     | O
leaving O
him O
to O
let O
himself O
in O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
put O
out O
her O
candle O
, O
that O
her O
father O
might O
not O
see O
its O
light O
under O
the O
door O
  O
and O
sat O
down O
|
     | O
on O
her O
bed O
to O
think O
. O
But O
after O
turning O
things O
over O
in O
her O
mind O
again O
and O
again O
, O
she O
could O
only O
|
     | O
determine O
at O
once O
to O
put O
an O
end O
to O
all O
further O
communication O
with O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON
, O
in O
the O
most O
|
     | O
decided O
way O
she O
could O
. O
Maidenly O
modesty O
( O
and O
true O
love O
is O
ever O
modest O
) O
seemed O
to O
oppose O
every O
|
     | O
plan O
she O
could O
think O
of O
, O
for O
showing O
Jem B-PERSON
how O
much O
she O
repented O
her O
decision O
against O
him O
, O
and O
|
     | O
how O
dearly O
she O
had O
now O
discovered O
that O
she O
loved O
him O
. O
She O
came O
to O
the O
unusual O
wisdom O
of O
|
     | O
resolving O
to O
do O
nothing O
, O
but O
try O
and O
be O
patient O
, O
and O
improve O
circumstances O
as O
they O
might O
turn O
|
     | O
up O
. O
Surely O
, O
if O
Jem B-PERSON
knew O
of O
her O
remaining O
unmarried O
, O
he O
would O
try O
his O
fortune O
again O
. O
He O
would O
|
     | O
never O
be O
content O
with O
one O
rejection O
  O
she O
believed O
she O
could O
not O
in O
his O
place O
. O
She O
had O
been O
very O
|
     | O
wrong O
, O
but O
now O
she O
would O
try O
and O
do O
right O
, O
and O
have O
womanly O
patience O
, O
until O
he O
saw O
her O
changed O
|
     | O
and O
repentant O
mind O
in O
her O
natural O
actions O
. O
Even O
if O
she O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
years B-DATE
, O
it O
was O
no O
more O
|
     | O
than O
now O
it O
was O
easy O
to O
look O
forward O
to O
, O
as O
a O
penance O
for O
her O
giddy O
flirting O
on O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
|
     | O
and O
her O
cruel O
mistake O
concerning O
her O
feelings O
on O
the O
other O
. O
So O
anticipating O
a O
happy O
ending O
to O
|
     | O
the O
course O
of O
her O
love O
, O
however O
distant O
it O
might O
be O
, O
she O
fell O
asleep O
just O
as O
the O
earliest O
|
     | O
factory O
bells O
were O
ringing O
. O
She O
had O
sunk O
down O
in O
her O
clothes O
, O
and O
her O
sleep O
was O
unrefreshing O
. O
|
     | O
She O
wakened O
up O
shivery O
and O
chill O
in O
body O
, O
and O
sorrow O
- O
stricken O
in O
mind O
, O
though O
she O
could O
not O
at O
|
     | O
first B-ORDINAL
rightly O
tell O
the O
cause O
of O
her O
depression O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
recalled O
the O
events O
of O
the B-TIME
night I-TIME
before O
, O
and O
still O
resolved O
to O
adhere O
to O
those O
|
     | O
determinations O
she O
had O
then O
formed O
. O
But O
patience O
seemed O
a O
far O
more O
difficult O
virtue O
this O
|
     | O
morning O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
hastened O
down O
- O
stairs O
, O
and O
in O
her O
earnest O
sad O
desire O
to O
do O
right O
, O
now O
took O
much O
pains O
to O
|
     | O
secure O
a O
comfortable O
though O
scanty O
breakfast O
for O
her O
father O
  O
and O
when O
he O
dawdled O
into O
the O
room O
, O
|
     | O
in O
an O
evidently O
irritable O
temper O
, O
she O
bore O
all O
with O
the O
gentleness O
of O
penitence O
, O
till O
at O
last O
|
     | O
her O
mild O
answers O
turned O
away O
wrath O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
loathed O
the O
idea O
of O
meeting O
Sally B-PERSON
Leadbitter I-PERSON
at O
her O
daily B-DATE
work O
  O
yet O
it O
must O
be O
done O
, O
and O
|
     | O
she O
tried O
to O
nerve O
herself O
for O
the O
encounter O
, O
and O
to O
make O
it O
at O
once O
understood O
, O
that O
having O
|
     | O
determined O
to O
give O
up O
having O
any O
thing O
further O
to O
do O
with O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON
, O
she O
considered O
the O
bond O
|
     | O
of O
intimacy O
broken O
between O
them O
. O
| 
  | O
But O
Sally B-PERSON
was O
not O
the O
person O
to O
let O
these O
resolutions O
be O
carried O
into O
effect O
too O
easily O
. O
She O
|
     | O
soon O
became O
aware O
of O
the O
present O
state O
of O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
feelings O
, O
but O
she O
thought O
they O
merely O
arose O
|
     | O
from O
the O
changeableness O
of O
girlhood O
, O
and O
that O
the O
time O
would O
come O
when O
Mary B-PERSON
would O
thank O
her O
for O
|
     | O
almost O
forcing O
her O
to O
keep O
up O
her O
meetings O
and O
communications O
with O
her O
rich O
lover O
. O
| 
  | O
So O
, O
when O
two B-DATE
days I-DATE
had O
passed O
over O
in O
rather O
too O
marked O
avoidance O
of O
Sally B-PERSON
on O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
part O
, O
and O
|
     | O
when O
the O
former O
was O
made O
aware O
by O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON
's O
complaints O
that O
Mary B-PERSON
was O
not O
keeping O
her O
|
     | O
appointments O
with O
him O
, O
and O
that O
unless O
he O
detained O
her O
by O
force O
, O
he O
had O
no O
chance O
of O
obtaining O
|
     | O
a O
word O
as O
she O
passed O
him O
in O
the O
street O
on O
her O
rapid O
walk O
home O
, O
she O
resolved O
to O
compel O
Mary B-PERSON
to O
|
     | O
what O
she O
called O
her O
own O
good O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
took O
no O
notice O
during O
the B-DATE
third I-DATE
day I-DATE
of O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
avoidance O
as O
they O
sat O
at O
work O
  O
she O
rather O
|
     | O
seemed O
to O
acquiesce O
in O
the O
coolness O
of O
their O
intercourse O
. O
She O
put O
away O
her O
sewing O
early O
, O
and O
|
     | O
went O
home O
to O
her O
mother O
, O
who O
, O
she O
said O
, O
was O
more O
ailing O
than O
usual O
. O
The O
other O
girls O
soon O
|
     | O
followed O
her O
example O
, O
and O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
casting O
a O
rapid O
glance O
up O
and O
down O
the O
street O
, O
as O
she O
stood O
|
     | O
last O
on O
Miss O
Simmonds B-PERSON
' O
door O
- O
step O
, O
darted O
homewards O
, O
in O
hopes O
of O
avoiding O
the O
person O
whom O
she O
|
     | O
was O
fast O
learning O
to O
dread O
. O
That O
night O
she O
was O
safe O
from O
any O
encounter O
on O
her O
road O
, O
and O
she O
|
     | O
arrived O
at O
home O
, O
which O
she O
found O
as O
she O
expected O
, O
empty O
  O
for O
she O
knew O
it O
was O
a O
club O
night B-TIME
, O
|
     | O
which O
her O
father O
would O
not O
miss O
. O
She O
sat O
down O
to O
recover O
breath O
, O
and O
to O
still O
her O
heart O
, O
which O
|
     | O
panted O
more O
from O
nervousness O
than O
from O
over O
- O
exertion O
, O
although O
she O
had O
walked O
so O
quickly O
. O
Then O
|
     | O
she O
rose O
, O
and O
taking O
off O
her O
bonnet O
, O
her O
eye O
caught O
the O
form O
of O
Sally B-PERSON
Leadbitter I-PERSON
passing O
the O
|
     | O
window O
with O
a O
lingering O
step O
, O
and O
looking O
into O
the O
darkness O
with O
all O
her O
might O
, O
as O
if O
to O
|
     | O
ascertain O
if O
Mary B-PERSON
were O
returned O
. O
In O
an O
instant O
she O
re O
- O
passed O
and O
knocked O
at O
the O
house O
- O
door O
, O
but O
|
     | O
without O
awaiting O
an O
answer O
, O
she O
entered O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Well O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
dear O
" O
( O
knowing O
well O
how O
little O
" O
dear O
" O
Mary B-PERSON
considered O
her O
just O
then O
) O
  O
" O
i O
's O
so O
|
     | O
difficult O
to O
get O
any O
comfortable O
talk O
at O
Miss O
Simmonds B-PERSON
' O
, O
I O
thought O
I O
'd O
just O
step O
up O
and O
see O
you O
|
     | O
at O
home O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
understood O
from O
what O
you O
said O
your O
mother O
was O
ailing O
, O
and O
that O
you O
wanted O
to O
be O
with O
her O
, O
" O
|
     | O
replied O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
in O
no O
welcoming O
tone O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Ay O
, O
but O
mother O
's O
better O
now O
, O
" O
said O
the O
unabashed O
Sally B-PERSON
. O
" O
Your O
father O
's O
out O
I O
suppose O
? O
" O
|
     | O
looking O
round O
as O
well O
as O
she O
could O
  O
for O
Mary B-PERSON
made O
no O
haste O
to O
perform O
the O
hospitable O
offices O
of O

     | O
striking O
a O
match O
, O
and O
lighting O
a O
candle O
. O

  | O
" O
Yes O
, O
he O
's O
out O

" O
said O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
shortly O
, O
and O
busying O
herself O
at O
last O
about O
the O
candle O
, O
without O

     | O
ever O
asking O
her O
visitor O
to O
sit O
down O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
So O
much O
the O
better O
, O
" O
answered O
Sally B-PERSON
, O
" O

as O
not O

him O

said O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
speaking O
at O
last O
heartily O
  O
and O
running O
to O
the O
door O
she O

     | O
would O
have O
fastened O
it O
, O
but O
Sally B-PERSON
held O
her O
hands O
, O
laughing O
meanwhile O
at O
her O
distress O
. O

" O
Oh O

talk O

me O

then O
, O
as O
they O
passed O
the O
house O
, O

     | O
and O
seemed O
to O
give O
her O
a O
respite O
, O
she O
continued O
, O
" O
Do O
, O
Sally B-PERSON
, O
dear O

very O

I O
dare O

keeping O
company O

all O

I O
'm O
very O
sorry O

" O
I O

said O
Sally B-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
more O
relenting O
mood O
, O
" O
I O
'll O
go O
back O
with O
you O
to O

     | O
where O
he O
's O
waiting O
for O
us O
  O
or O
rather O
, O
I O
should O
say O
, O
where O
I O
told O
him O
to O
wait O
for O
a B-CARDINAL
quarter I-CARDINAL
of O
|
     | O
an O
hour O
, O
till O
I O
seed O
if O
your O
father O
was O
at O
home O
  O

if O
I O
did O
n't O
come O
back O

that O
time O

     | O
said O
he O

" O

" O
Oh O
, O
let O
us O
go O
, O
let O
us O
go O
, O
" O
said O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
feeling O
that O
the O
interview O
must O
be O
, O
and O
had O
better O
be O
|
     | O
anywhere O
than O
at O
home O
, O
where O
her O
father O
might O
return O
at O
any B-TIME
minute I-TIME
. O
She O
snatched O
up O
her O
bonnet O
, O
|
     | O
and O
was O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
court O
in O
an O
instant O
  O
but O
then O
, O
not O
knowing O
whether O
to O
turn O
to O
the O
|
     | O
right O
or O
to O
the O
left O
, O
she O
was O
obliged O
to O
wait O
for O
Sally B-PERSON
, O
who O
came O
leisurely O
up O
, O
and O
put O
her O
arm O
|
     | O
through O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
, O
with O
a O
kind O
of O
decided O
hold O
, O
intended O
to O
prevent O
the O
possibility O
of O
her O
|
     | O
changing O
her O
mind O
, O
and O
turning O
back O
. O
But O
this O
, O
under O
the O
circumstances O
, O
was O
quite O
different O
to O
|
     | O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
plan O
. O
She O
had O
wondered O
more O
than O
once O
if O
she O
must O
not O
have O
another O
interview O
with O
Mr. O
|
     | O
Carson B-PERSON
  O
and O
had O
then O
determined O
, O
while O
she O
expressed O
her O
resolution O
that O
it O
should O
be O
the O
final O
|
     | O
one O
, O
to O
tell O
him O
how O
sorry O
she O
was O
if O
she O
had O
thoughtlessly O
given O
him O
false O
hopes O
. O
For O
be O
it O
|
     | O
remembered O
, O
she O
had O
the O
innocence O
, O
or O
the O
ignorance O
, O
to O
believe O
his O
intentions O
honourable O
  O
and O
|
     | O
he O
, O
feeling O
that O
at O
any O
price O
he O
must O
have O
her O
, O
only O
that O
he O
would O
obtain O
her O
as O
cheaply O
as O
he O
|
     | O
could O
, O
had O
never O
undeceived O
her O
  O
while O
Sally B-PERSON
Leadbitter I-PERSON
laughed O
in O
her O
sleeve O
at O
them O
both O
, O
and O
|
     | O
wondered O
how O
it O
would O
all O
end,—whether O
Mary B-PERSON
would O
gain O
her O
point O
of O
marriage O
, O
with O
her O
sly O
|
     | O
affectation O
of O
believing O
such O
to O
be O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON
's O
intention O
in O
courting O
her O
. O
| 
  | O
Not O
very O
far O
from O
the O
end O
of O
the O
street O
, O
into O
which O
the O
court O
where O
Mary B-PERSON
lived O
opened O
, O
they O
|
     | O
met O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON
, O
his O
hat O
a O
good O
deal O
slouched O
over O
his O
face O
as O
if O
afraid O
of O
being O
recognised O
. O
He O
|
     | O
turned O
when O
he O
saw O
them O
coming O
, O
and O
led O
the O
way O
without O
uttering O
a O
word O
( O
although O
they O
were O
|
     | O
close O
behind O
) O
to O
a O
street O
of O
half B-CARDINAL
- O
finished O
houses O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
length O
of O
the O
walk O
gave O
Mary B-PERSON
time O
to O
recoil O
from O
the O
interview O
which O
was O
to O
follow O
  O
but O
|
     | O
even O
if O
her O
own O
resolve O
to O
go O
through O
with O
it O
had O
failed O
, O
there O
was O
the O
steady O
grasp O
of O
Sally B-PERSON
|
     | O
Leadbitter O
, O
which O
she O
could O
not O
evade O
without O
an O
absolute O
struggle O
. O
| 
  | O
At O
last O
he O
stopped O
in O
the O
shelter O
and O
concealment O
of O
a O
wooden O
fence O
, O
put O
up O
to O
keep O
the O
|
     | O
building O
rubbish O
from O
intruding O
on O
the O
foot O
- O
pavement O
. O
Inside O
this O
fence O
, O
a O
minute O
afterwards O
, O
|
     | O
the O
girls O
were O
standing O
by O
him O
  O
Mary B-PERSON
now O
returning O
Sally B-PERSON
's O
detaining O
grasp O
with O
interest O
, O
for O
|
     | O
she O
had O
determined O
on O
the O
way O
to O
make O
her O
a O
witness O
, O
willing O
or O
unwilling O
, O
to O
the O
ensuing O
|
     | O
conversation O
. O
But O
Sally B-PERSON
's O
curiosity O
led O
her O
to O
be O
a O
very O
passive O
prisoner O
in O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
hold O
. O
| 
  | O
With O
more O
freedom O
than O
he O
had O
ever O
used O
before O
, O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON
put O
his O
arm O
firmly O
round O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
|
     | O
waist O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
her O
indignant O
resistance O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Nay O
, O
nay O
! O
you O
little O
witch O
! O
Now O
I O
have O
caught O
you O
, O
I O
shall O
keep O
you O
prisoner O

Tell O
me O
now O

     | O
what O
has O
made O
you O
run O
away O

" O
| 
  | O
Mary B-PERSON
ceased O
struggling O
, O
but O
turned O
so O
as O
to O
be O
almost O
opposite O
to O
him O
, O
while O
she O
spoke O
out O
|
     | O
calmly O
and O
boldly O
, O
| 
  | O
" O
Mr. O

I O
met O
you O
last B-DATE

     | O
evening O
, O
I O
have O
made O
up O
my O

nothing O
more O

I O

was O
surprised O

the O
next O

vanity O
came O
to O
his O

" O
Why O
, O
Sally B-PERSON
, O
had O
you O
any O
idea O

" O
No O

I O
had O

sure O

But O
if O
you O
did O
think O
of O

why O
( O
if O
I O
may O
be O
so O
bold O
as O

     | O
to O
ask O

did O
you O
go O
and O
tell O
her O
you O
had O
no O
thought O
of O
doing O
otherwise O
by O
her O
? O
That O
was O
what O
put O
|
     | O
her O
up O
at O
last O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Why O
I O
had O
repeatedly O
before O
led O
her O
to O
infer O
that O
marriage O
was O
not O
my O
object O
. O
I O
never O

     | O
dreamed O
she O
could O
have O
been O
so O
foolish O
as O
to O
have O
mistaken O
me O
, O
little O
provoking O
romancer O
though O
|
     | O
she O
be O
! O
So O
I O
naturally O
wished O
her O
to O
know O
what O
a O
sacrifice O
of O
prejudice O
, O
of O
— O
of O
myself O
, O
in O

     | O
short O
, O
I O
was O
willing O
to O
make O
for O
her O
sake O
  O
yet O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
she O
was O
aware O
of O
it O
after O
all O
. O
I O
|
     | O
believe O
I O
might O
have O
any O
lady O
in O
Manchester B-GPE
if O
I O
liked O
, O
and O
yet O
I O
was O
willing O
and O
ready O
to O

     | O
marry O
a O
poor O

Do O
n't O
you O
understand O
me O
now O

do O
n't O
you O
see O

But O
they O
looked O
on O
their O

     | O
dismissals O
with O
very O
different O
eyes O

He O
who O
loved O
her O

all O

with O
all O
his O
soul O

     | O
considered O
his O
rejection O
final O
. O
He O
did O
not O
comfort O
himself O
with O
the O
idea O
, O
which O
would O
have O
|
     | O
proved O
so O
well O
founded O
in O
his O
case O

that O
women O
have O
second B-ORDINAL
thoughts O
about O
casting O
off O
their O

     | O

He O
had O
too O
much O
respect O
for O
his O
own O
heartiness O
of O
love O
to O
believe O
himself O
unworthy O

     | O
Mary B-PERSON
  O
that O
mock O

not O

did O
not O

and O
though O
that O
may O
sound O
a O
trivial O
every B-DATE

expression O
, O
yet O
the O
reality O
of O
it O
cut O
him O

     | O
to O
the O
heart O
. O
Wild O
visions O
of O

, O
of O
drinking O
himself O
into O

, O
of O
becoming O

     | O
desperate O
in O
some O
way O
or O
another O
, O
entered O
his O
mind O
  O
but O
then O
the O
thought O
of O
his O
mother O
stood O
|
     | O
like O
an O
angel O
with O
a O
drawn O
sword O
in O
the O
way O
to O
sin O

For O
, O
you O
know O
, O
" O
he O
was O
the O
only O
son O
of O
his O

     | O
mother O
, O
and O
she O
was O
a O
widow O

" O
dependent O
on O
him O

So O
he O
could O
not O
squander O
away O

     | O
health O

time O
, O
which O
were O
to O
him O
money O

her O

He O
went O
to O
his O

     | O
work O
, O
accordingly O
, O
to O
all O
outward O

just O

with O
a O

  | O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON
, O
as O
we O
have O
seen O
, O
persevered O
in O
considering O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
rejection O
of O
him O
as O
merely O
a O

     | O
" O
charming O
caprice O
. O
" O
If O
she O
were O
at O
work O
, O
Sally B-PERSON
Leadbitter I-PERSON
was O
sure O
to O
slip O
a O
passionately O
|
     | O
loving O
note O
into O
her O
hand O
, O
and O
then O
so O
skilfully O
move O
away O
from O
her O
side O
, O
that O
Mary B-PERSON
could O
not O
|
     | O
all O
at O
once O
return O
it O
, O
without O
making O
some O
sensation O
among O
the O
work O
- O
women O
. O
She O
was O
even O
forced O
|
     | O
to O
take O
several O
home O
with O
her O
. O
But O
after O
reading O
one O
, O
she O
determined O
on O
her O
plan O
. O
She O
made O
no O
|
     | O
great O
resistance O
to O
receiving O
them O
from O
Sally B-PERSON
, O
but O
kept O
them O
unopened O
, O
and O
occasionally O
|
     | O
returned O
them O
in O
a O
blank O
half B-CARDINAL
- O
sheet O
of O
paper O
. O
But O
far O
worse O
than O
this O
, O
was O
the O
being O
so O
|
     | O
constantly O
waylaid O
as O
she O
went O
home O
by O
her O
persevering O
lover O
  O
who O
had O
been O
so O
long O
acquainted O

     | O
with O
all O
her O
habits O
, O
that O
she O
found O
it O
difficult O
to O
evade O
him O
. O
Late O
or O
early O
, O
she O
was O
never O

     | O
certain O
of O
being O
free O
from O
him O

Go O
this O
way O
or O
that O
, O
he O
might O
come O
up O
some O
cross O
street O
when O
|
     | O
she O
had O
just O
congratulated O
herself O
on O
evading O
him O
for O
that B-DATE
day I-DATE
. O
He O
could O
not O
have O
taken O
a O
surer O
|
     | O
mode O
of O
making O
himself O
odious O
to O
her O
. O

And O
all O
this O

Jem B-PERSON

never O

she O
did O
not O

she O
had O
hoped O

would O
have O

just O

     | O
to O

n't O
changed O
her O
mind O

He O
never O

Then O
she O
grew O
weary O

impatient O

her O

sank O

from O

up O

down O

felt O
as O

did O
well O
enough O

now O
she O
required O
all O

     | O
the O
aid O
that O
could O
be O

from O
external O

And O
her O

never O

the O
relief O
of O
telling O

could O
not O

     | O
much O
of O
her O

he O

Margaret B-PERSON
looked O
at O

fancy O
the O

But O
it O
was O
something O

Alice B-PERSON

joy O
at O
once O
more O
having O
her O

     | O
foster O
- O
child O
with O
her O
. O
She O
did O
not O
speak O
, O
for O
she O
really O
could O
not O
  O
but O
the O
tears O
came O
coursing O
|
     | O
down O
her O
old O
withered O
cheeks O
, O
and O
dimmed O
the O
horn O
spectacles O
she O
had O
put O
on O
, O
in O
order O
to O
pry O

     | O
lovingly O
into O
his O
face O

So O
what O
with O
her O
failing O
sight O
, O
and O
her O
tear O
- O
blinded O
eyes O
, O
she O
gave O
up O
|
     | O
the O
attempt O
of O
learning O
his O
face O
by O
heart O
through O
the O
medium O
of O
that O
sense O
, O
and O
tried O
another O
. O
|
     | O
She O
passed O
her O
sodden O
, O
shrivelled O
hands O
, O
all O
trembling O
with O
eagerness O
, O
over O
his O
manly O
face O
, O
|
     | O
bent O
meekly O
down O
in O
order O
that O
she O
might O
more O
easily O
make O
her O
strange O
inspection O
. O
At O
last O
, O
her O

     | O
soul O
was O
satisfied O
. O

  | O
After O
tea O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
feeling O
sure O
there O
was O
much O
to O

on O
both O
sides O

at O
which O
it O
would O
be O

     | O
better O

not O
even O

herself O
, O
got O
up O
to O
go O
away O
. O

     | O
This O
seemed O
to O
arouse O
Alice B-PRODUCT
from O
her O
dreamy O
consciousness O
of O
exceeding O
happiness O
, O
and O
she O

     | O
hastily O
followed O

outside O

with O

she O

     | O
took O
hold O
of O
Mary B-PERSON

, O
and O
spoke O
nearly O
the O
first B-ORDINAL

our O
third B-ORDINAL

as O
many O

many O
a O
time O
telled O
us O
all O

     | O
about O
it O

You O
see O
he O
were O
becalmed O
off O
Chatham B-FAC
Island I-FAC

such O

So O
some O
of O
the O
men O
took O
the O

     | O
long O
boat O

pulled O
for O

were O
like O
  O

when O
they O
got O
near O
, O
they O

     | O
heard O
a O
puffing O
, O
like O
a O
creature O
come O
up O
to O
take O
breath O
  O
you O

they O
looked O

around O

what O
should O
they O

a O

sitting O
on O

sunning O

water O
is O
always O
warmer O

it O

rough O

you O

so O
I O
suppose O
in O
the O
calm O
she O
felt O
it O
rather O

     | O
chilly O

come O
up O

" O

asked O
Mary B-PERSON

breathlessly O

  | O
Job O
took O
his O
pipe O
off O
the O
chimney O

piece O

began O
to O
smoke O
with O
very O
audible O
puffs O
, O
as O
if O
the O

| 
  | O
" O
Oh O
! O
Jack B-PERSON
used O
to O

Mary B-PERSON

there O
were O
one O
little O
difference O
: O
her O

green O

" O

  | O
" O
I O

Oh O

it O
is O
when O
you O

always O

, O
she O
had O
green O

were O

     | O
proud O
enough O

all O
thought O

may O
be O
as O
good O

they O
were O

For O
some O
folk O

" O
This O

     | O
the O
same O
downward O
path O
to O
vice O
. O
To O
whom O
could O
she O
speak O
and O
ask O
for O
aid O
? O
She O
shrank O
from O
the O
|
     | O
idea O
of O
addressing O
John B-PERSON
Barton I-PERSON
again O
  O
her O
heart O
sank O
within O
her O
, O
at O
the O
remembrance O
of O
his O
|
     | O
fierce O
repulsing O
action O
, O
and O
far O
fiercer O
words O
. O
It O
seemed O
worse O
than O
death O
to O
reveal O
her O
|
     | O
condition O
to O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
else O
she O
sometimes O
thought O
that O
this O
course O
would O
be O
the O
most O
terrible O
, O
the O
|
     | O
most O
efficient O
warning O
. O
She O
must O
speak O
  O
to O
that O
she O
was O
soul O
- O
compelled O
  O
but O
to O
whom O
? O
She O
|
     | O
dreaded O
addressing O
any O
of O
her O
former O
female O
acquaintance O
, O
even O
supposing O
they O
had O
sense O
, O
or O
|
     | O
spirit O
, O
or O
interest O
enough O
to O
undertake O
her O
mission O
. O
| 
  | O
To O
whom O
shall O
the O
outcast O
prostitute O
tell O
her O
tale O
? O
Who O
will O
give O
her O
help O
in O
her B-DATE
day I-DATE
of O
|
     | O
need O
? O
Hers O
is O
the O
leper O
- O
sin O
, O
and O
all O
stand O
aloof O
dreading O
to O
be O
counted O
unclean O
. O
| 
  | O
In O
her O
wild O
night O
wanderings O
, O
she O
had O
noted O
the O
haunts O
and O
habits O
of O
many O
a O
one O
who O
little O
|
     | O
thought O
of O
a O
watcher O
in O
the O
poor O
forsaken O
woman O
. O
You O
may O
easily O
imagine O
that O
a O
double O
interest O
|
     | O
was O
attached O
by O
her O
to O
the O
ways O
and O
companionships O
of O
those O
with O
whom O
she O
had O
been O
acquainted O
|
     | O
in O
the B-DATE
days I-DATE
which O
, O
when O
present O
, O
she O
had O
considered O
hardly O
- O
worked O
and O
monotonous O
, O
but O
which O
now O
|
     | O
in O
retrospection O
seemed O
so O
happy O
and O
unclouded O
. O
Accordingly O
, O
she O
had O
, O
as O
we O
have O
seen O
, O
known O
|
     | O
where O
to O
meet O
with O
John B-PERSON
Barton I-PERSON
on O
that O
unfortunate O
night O
, O
which O
had O
only O
produced O
irritation O
in O
|
     | O
him O
, O
and O
a O
month B-DATE
's O
imprisonment O
to O
her O
. O
She O
had O
also O
observed O
that O
he O
was O
still O
intimate O
with O
|
     | O
the O
Wilsons O
. O
She O
had O
seen O
him O
walking O
and O
talking O
with O
both O
father O
and O
son O
  O
her O
old O
friends O
|
     | O
too O
  O
and O
she O
had O
shed O
unregarded O
, O
unvalued O
tears O
, O
when O
some O
one O
had O
casually O
told O
her O
of O
George B-PERSON
|
     | I-PERSON
Wilson I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
sudden O
death O
. O
It O
now O
flashed O
across O
her O
mind O
, O
that O
to O
the O
son O
, O
to O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
play O
- O
fellow O
, O
|
     | O
her O
elder O
brother O
in O
the B-DATE
days I-DATE
of O
childhood O
, O
her O
tale O
might O
be O
told O
, O
and O
listened O
to O
with O
|
     | O
interest O
, O
and O
some O
mode O
of O
action O
suggested O
by O
him O
by O
which O
Mary B-PERSON
might O
be O
guarded O
and O
|
     | O
saved O
. O
| 
  | O
All O
these O
thoughts O
had O
passed O
through O
her O
mind O
while O
yet O
she O
was O
in O
prison O
  O
so O
when O
she O
was O
|
     | O
turned O
out O
, O
her O
purpose O
was O
clear O
, O
and O
she O
did O
not O
feel O
her O
desolation O
of O
freedom O
as O
she O
would O
|
     | O
otherwise O
have O
done O
. O
| 
  | O
That O
night O
she O
stationed O
herself O
early O
near O
the O
foundry O
where O
she O
knew O
Jem B-PERSON
worked O
  O
he O
stayed O
|
     | O
later O
than O
usual O
, O
being O
detained O
by O
some O
arrangements O
for O
the O
morrow O
. O
She O
grew O
tired O
and O
|
     | O
impatient O
  O
many O
workmen O
had O
come O
out O
of O
the O
door O
in O
the O
long O
, O
dead O
, O
brick O
wall O
, O
and O
eagerly O
had O
|
     | O
she O
peered O
into O
their O
faces O
, O
deaf O
to O
all O
insult O
or O
curse O
. O
He O
must O
have O
gone O
home O
early O
  O
one B-CARDINAL
|
     | O
more O
turn O
in O
the O
street O
, O
and O
she O
would O
go O
. O
| 
  | O
During O
that O
turn O
he O
came O
out O
, O
and O
in O
the O
quiet O
of O
that O
street O
of O
workshops O
and O
warehouses O
, O
|
     | O
she O
directly O
heard O
his O
steps O
. O
Now O
her O
heart O
failed O
her O
for O
an O
instant O
  O
but O
still O
she O
was O
not O
|
     | O
daunted O
from O
her O
purpose O
, O
painful O
as O
its O
fulfilment O
was O
sure O
to O
be O
. O
She O
laid O
her O
hand O
on O
his O
|
     | O
arm O
. O
As O
she O
expected O
, O
after O
a O
momentary O
glance O
at O
the O
person O
who O
thus O
endeavoured O
to O
detain O
|
     | O
him O
, O
he O
made O
an O
effort O
to O
shake O
it O
off O
, O
and O
pass O
on O
. O
But O
trembling O
as O
she O
was O
, O
she O
had O
provided O
|
     | O
against O
this O
by O
a O
firm O
and O
unusual O
grasp O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
You O
must O
listen O
to O
me O
, O
Jem B-PERSON
Wilson I-PERSON
, O
" O
she O
said O
, O
with O
almost O
an O
accent O
of O
command O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Go O
away O
, O
missis O
  O
I O
've O
nought O
to O
do O
with O
you O
, O
either O
in O
hearkening O
, O
or O
talking O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
He O
made O
another O
struggle O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
You O
must O
listen O
, O
" O
she O
said O
again O
, O
authoritatively O
, O
" O
for O
Mary B-PERSON
Barton I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
sake O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
The O
spell O
of O
her O
name O
was O
as O
potent O
as O
that O
of O
the O
mariner O
's O
glittering O
eye O
. O
" O
He O
listened O
|
     | O
like O
a O
three B-DATE
- I-DATE
year I-DATE
child O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
know O
you O
care O
enough O
for O
her O
to O
wish O
to O
save O
her O
from O
harm O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
He O
interrupted O
his O
earnest O
gaze O
into O
her O
face O
, O
with O
the O
exclamation O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
And O
who O
can O
yo O
be O
to O
know O
Mary B-PERSON
Barton I-PERSON

to O
know O
that O

ought O
to O
me O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
There O
was O
a O
little O
strife O
in O
Esther B-PERSON
's O
mind O
for O
an O
instant O
, O
between O
the O
shame O
of O
acknowledging O
|
     | O
herself O
, O
and O
the O
additional O
weight O
to O
her O
revelation O
which O
such O
acknowledgment O
would O
give O
. O
Then O
|
     | O
she O
spoke O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Do O
you O
remember O
Esther B-PERSON
, O
the O
sister O

" O
Yes O

her O
well O

But O
yo O
are O
not O
Esther B-PERSON
, O
are O
you O
? O
" O
He O
looked O
again O
into O
her O
face O
, O
and O
|
     | O
seeing O
that O
indeed O
it O
was O
his O
boyhood O
's O
friend O
, O
he O
took O
her O
hand O
, O
and O
shook O
it O
with O
a O
|
     | O
cordiality O
that O
forgot O
the O
present O
in O
the O
past O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Why O
, O
Esther B-PERSON
! O
Where O
han O
ye O

us O
could O
find O
you O
out O

" O
| 
  | O
The O
question O
was O
asked O
thoughtlessly O
, O
but O
answered O
with O
fierce O
earnestness O
. O

" O
Where O

Can O
you O
not O
guess O

But O
the O
story O
of O
my O
life O

wanted O

give O
force O
to O
my O
speech O

She O
remarked O
not O

in O
her O

the O

the O
sudden O

told O

fearfully O

when O
I O
am O
sunk O
so O
low O
. O
You O
do O
n't O
guess O
how O
kind O
he O
was O
. O
He O
gave O
me O
fifty B-QUANTITY
pound I-QUANTITY
before O
we O
|
     | O
parted O
, O
and O
I O
knew O
he O
could O
ill O
spare O
it O
. O
Do O
n't O
, O
Jem B-PERSON
, O
please O
, O
" O
as O
his O
muttered O
indignation O
rose O
|
     | O
again O
. O
For O
her O
sake O
he O
ceased O
. O
" O
I O
might O
have O
done O
better O
with O
the O
money O
  O
I O
see O
now O
. O
But O
I O
did O
|
     | O
not O
know O
the O
value O
of O
money O
. O
Formerly O
I O
had O
earned O
it O
easily O
enough O
at O
the O
factory O
, O
and O
as O
I O
|
     | O
had O
no O
more O
sensible O
wants O
, O
I O
spent O
it O
on O
dress O
and O
on O
eating O
. O
While O
I O
lived O
with O
him O
, O
I O
had O
it O
|
     | O
for O
asking O
  O
and O
fifty B-QUANTITY
pounds I-QUANTITY
would O
, O
I O
thought O
, O
go O
a O
long O
way O
. O
So O
I O
went O
back O
to O
Chester B-PERSON
, O
where O
|
     | O
I O
'd O
been O
so O
happy O
, O
and O
set O
up O
a O
small O
- O
ware O
shop O
, O
and O
hired O
a O
room O
near O
. O
We O
should O
have O
done O
|
     | O
well O
, O
but O
alas O
! O
alas O
! O
my O
little O
girl O
fell O
ill O
, O
and O
I O
could O
not O
mind O
my O
shop O
and O
her O
too O
  O
and O
|
     | O
things O
grew O
worse O
and O
worse O
. O
I O
sold O
my O
goods O
any O
how O
to O
get O
money O
to O
buy O
her O
food O
and O
medicine O
  O
|
     | O
I O
wrote O
over O
and O
over O
again O
to O
her O
father O
for O
help O
, O
but O
he O
must O
have O
changed O
his O
quarters O
, O
for O
|
     | O
I O
never O
got O
an O
answer O
. O
The O
landlord O
seized O
the O
few O
bobbins O
and O
tapes O
I O
had O
left O
, O
for O
shop O
- O
rent O
  O
|
     | O
and O
the O
person O
to O
whom O
the O
mean O
little O
room O
, O
to O
which O
we O
had O
been O
forced O
to O
remove O
, O
belonged O
, O
|
     | O
threatened O
to O
turn O
us O
out O
unless O
his O
rent O
was O
paid O
  O
it O
had O
run O
on O
many B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
, O
and O
it O
was O
|
     | O
winter B-DATE
, O
cold O
bleak O
winter B-DATE
  O
and O
my O
child O
was O
so O
ill O
, O
so O
ill O
, O
and O
I O
was O
starving O
. O
And O
I O
could O
not O
|
     | O
bear O
to O
see O
her O
suffer O
, O
and O
forgot O
how O
much O
better O
it O
would O
be O
for O
us O
to O
die O
together —oh O
her O
|
     | O
moans B-NORP
, O
her O
moans B-NORP
, O
which O
money O
would O
give O
me O
the O
means O
of O
relieving O
! O
So O
I O
went O
out O
into O
the O
|
     | O
street O
, O
one B-TIME
January I-TIME
night I-TIME
— O
Do O
you O
think O
God O
will O
punish O
me O
for O
that O
? O
" O
she O
asked O
with O
wild O
|
     | O
vehemence O
, O
almost O
amounting O
to O
insanity O
, O
and O
shaking O
Jem B-PERSON
's O
arm O
in O
order O
to O
force O
an O
answer O
from O
|
     | O
him O
. O
| 
  | O
But O
before O
he O
could O
shape O
his O
heart O
's O
sympathy O
into O
words O
, O
her O
voice O
had O
lost O
its O
wildness O
, O
|
     | O
and O
she O
spoke O
with O
the O
quiet O
of O
despair O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
But O
it O
's O
no O
matter O
! O
I O
've O
done O
that O
since O
, O
which O
separates O
us O
as O
far O
asunder O
as O
heaven O
and O
|
     | O
hell O
can O
be O
. O
" O
Her O
voice O
rose O
again O
to O
the O
sharp O
pitch O
of O
agony O
. O
" O
My O
darling O
! O
my O
darling O
! O
even O
|
     | O
after O
death O
I O
may O
not O
see O
thee O
, O
my O
own O
sweet O
one O
! O
She O
was O
so O
good O
— O
like O
a O
little O
angel O
. O
What O
is O
|
     | O
that O
text O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
remember,—that O
text O
mother O
used O
to O
teach O
me O
when O
I O
sat O
on O
her O
knee O
long O
ago O
  O
|
     | O
it O
begins O
, O
' O
Blessed O

the O
pure O

" O
— O

  | O
" O
Blessed O

for O
they O
shall O

God O

" O

  | O
" O
Ay O
, O
that O
's O
it O
! O
It O
would O
break O
mother O
's O
heart O
if O
she O
knew O
what O
I O
am O
now O
— O
it O
did O
break O
Mary B-PERSON
's O

     | O
heart O
, O
you O
see O
. O
And O
now O
I O
recollect O
it O
was O
about O
her O
child O
I O
wanted O
so O
to O
see O
you O
, O
Jem B-PERSON

You O

     | O
know O
Mary B-PERSON
Barton I-PERSON
, O
do O
n't O
you O
? O
" O
said O
she O
, O
trying O
to O
collect O
her O
thoughts O
. O
| 
  | O
Yes O
, O
Jem B-PERSON
knew O
her O
. O
How O
well O
, O
his O
beating O
heart O
could O
testify O
! O
| 
  | O
" O
Well O
, O
there O
's O
something O
to O
do O
for O
her O
  O
I O
forget O
what O
  O
wait O
a B-TIME
minute I-TIME
! O
She O
is O
so O
like O
my O
|
     | O
little O
girl O
  O
" O
said O
she O
, O
raising O
her O
eyes O
, O
glistening O
with O
unshed O
tears O
, O
in O
search O
of O
the O
|
     | O
sympathy O
of O
Jem B-PERSON
's O
countenance O
. O
| 
  | O
He O
deeply O
pitied O
her O
  O
but O
oh O
! O
how O
he O
longed O
to O
recall O
her O
mind O
to O
the O
subject O
of O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
and O
|
     | O
the O
lover O
above O
her O
in O
rank O
, O
and O
the O
service O
to O
be O
done O
for O
her O
sake O
. O
But O
he O
controlled O
himself O
|
     | O
to O
silence O
. O
After O
awhile O
, O
she O
spoke O
again O
, O
and O
in O
a O
calmer O
voice O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
When O
I O
came O
to O
Manchester B-PERSON
( O
for O
I O
could O
not O
stay O
in O
Chester B-PERSON
after O
her O
death O
) O
, O
I O
found O
you O
all O
|
     | O
out O
very O
soon O
. O
And O
yet O
I O
never O
thought O
my O
poor O
sister O
was O
dead O
. O
I O
suppose O
I O
would O
not O
think O
so O
. O
|
     | O
I O
used O
to O
watch O
about O
the O
court O
where O
John B-PERSON
lived O
, O
for O
many O
and O
many O
a O
night O
, O
and O
gather O
all O
I O
|
     | O
could O
about O
them O
from O
the O
neighbours O
' O
talk O
  O
for O
I O
never O
asked O
a O
question O
. O
I O
put O
this O
and O
that O
|
     | O
together O
, O
and O
followed O
one O
, O
and O
listened O
to O
the O
other O
  O
many O
's O
the O
time O
I O
've O
watched O
the O
|
     | O
policeman O
off O
his O
beat O
, O
and O
peeped O
through O
the O
chink O
of O
the O
window O
- O
shutter O
to O
see O
the O
old O
room O
, O
|
     | O
and O
sometimes O
Mary B-PERSON
or O
her O
father O
sitting O
up O
late O
for O
some O
reason O
or O
another O
. O
I O
found O
out O
Mary B-PERSON
|
     | O
went O
to O
learn O
dress O
- O
making O
, O
and O
I O
began O
to O
be O
frightened O
for O
her O
  O
for O
it O
's O
a O
bad O
life O
for O
a O
|
     | O
girl O
to O
be O
out O
late B-TIME
at I-TIME
night I-TIME
in O
the O
streets O
, O
and O
after O
many B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour I-TIME
of O
weary O
work O
, O
they O
're O
|
     | O
ready O
to O
follow O
after O
any O
novelty O
that O
makes O
a O
little O
change O
. O
But O
I O
made O
up O
my O
mind O
, O
that O
bad O
|
     | O
as O
I O
was O
, O
I O
could O
watch O
over O
Mary B-PERSON
and O
perhaps O
keep O
her O
from O
harm O
. O
So O
I O
used O
to O
wait O
for O
her O
at O
|
     | O
nights O
, O
and O
follow O
her O
home O
, O
often O
when O
she O
little O
knew O
any O
one O
was O
near O
her O
. O
There O
was O
one O
of O
|
     | O
her O
companions O
I O
never O
could O
abide O
, O
and O
I O
'm O
sure O
that O
girl O
is O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
some O
mischief O
. O
|
     | O
By O
- O
and O
- O
bye O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
walks O
homewards O
were O
not O
alone O
. O
She O
was O
joined O
soon O
after O
she O
came O
out O
, O
by O
a O
|
     | O
man O
  O
a O
gentleman O
. O
I O
began O
to O
fear O
for O
her O
, O
for O
I O
saw O
she O
was O
light O
- O
hearted O
, O
and O
pleased O
with O
|
     | O
his O
attentions O
  O
and O
I O
thought O
worse O
of O
him O
for O
having O
such O
long O
talks O
with O
that O
bold O
girl O
I O
|
     | O
told O
you O
of O
. O
But O
I O
was O
laid O
up O
for O
a O
long O
time O
with O
spitting O
of O
blood O
  O
and O
could O
do O
nothing O
. O
|
     | O
I O
'm O
sure O
it O
made O
me O
worse O
, O
thinking O
about O
what O
might O
be O
happening O
to O
Mary B-PERSON
. O
And O
when O
I O
came O
out O
, O
|
     | O
all O
was O
going O
on O
as O
before O
, O
only O
she O
seemed O
fonder O
of O
him O
than O
ever O
  O
and O
oh O
Jem B-PERSON
! O
her O
father O
|
     | O
wo O
n't O
listen O
to O
me O
, O
and O
it O
's O
you O
must O
save O
Mary B-PERSON
! O
You O
're O
like O
a O
brother O
to O
her O
, O
and O
maybe O
could O
|
     | O
give O
her O
advice O
and O
watch O
over O
her O
, O
and O
at O
any O
rate O
John B-PERSON
will O
hearken O
to O
you O
  O
only O
he O
's O
so O
|
     | O
stern O
and O
so O
cruel O
. O
" O
She O
began O
to O
cry O
a O
little O
at O
the O
remembrance O
of O
his O
harsh O
words O
  O
but O
Jem B-PERSON
|
     | O
cut O
her O
short O
by O
his O
hoarse O
, O
stern O
inquiry O
, O
| 
  | O
" O
Who O
is O
this O
spark O
that O
Mary B-PERSON
loves O
? O
Tell O
me O
his O
name O
! O
" O

" O
It O

Carson B-PERSON

old O

son O
, O
that O
your O
father O
worked O
for O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
There O
was O
a O
pause O
. O
She O
broke O
the O
silence O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Oh O
! O
Jem B-PERSON
, O
I O
charge O
you O
with O
the O
care O
of O
her O
! O
I O
suppose O
it O
would O
be O
murder O
to O
kill O
her O
, O
but O
it O

     | O
would O
be O
better O

die O

to O
live O

lead O
such O
a O
life O

Do O
you O

me O

Yes O

would O
be O
better O

all O
dead O

This O
was O
said O
as O
if O

aloud O

he O
immediately O
changed O
his O
tone O

" O

She O
was O
silent O
for O
a B-TIME
minute I-TIME
, O
and O
he O
hoped O

had O
gained O
his O
point O

she O
said O

it O

she O
added O
, O

     | O
with O
accents O
of O
deep O
despair O

did O
not O
relax O
his O

said O
she O

still O
seemed O
inclined O
to O
urge O
her O

the O
memory O

said O

she O
, O
shuddering O
, O

glaring O
round O
with O
terrified O
eyes O

some O
spiritual O

I O

it O

worse O

out O

" O

  | O
Jem B-PERSON
was O
silent O
from O
deep O
sympathy O

Oh O
! O
could O
he O
, O
then O

do O
nothing O

spoke O
again O

in O
a O
less O
excited O
tone O

for O

the O
great O
error O

loving O
one B-CARDINAL

  | O
With O
heart O

soul O

though O
in O
few O
words O
, O
Jem B-PERSON
promised O
that O
if O
aught O
earthly O
could O
keep O
her O

     | O
from O
falling O
, O
he O
would O
do O
it O

Then O
she O
blessed O
him O

him O
good O
- O
night O

  | O
" O
Stay O
a O
minute O

" O
said O
he O

was O
on O
the O
point O

departure O

She O
laughed O
strangely O

" O

do O
you O

come O
at O
night B-TIME

look O
at O
the O
corners O

     | O
the O
streets O
about O
here O

The O
colder O

bleaker O

more O
stormy O
the O
night O

more O
certain O

you O
will O

then O
, O
" O
she O
added O
, O
with O
a O
plaintive O
fall O
in O
her O
voice O
, O
" O
it O
is O
so O

cold O
sleeping O

Again O
she O
rapidly O
turned O
off O
, O
and O
Jem B-PERSON
also O
went O
on O
his O
way O
. O
But O
before O
he O
reached O
the O
end O
of O

     | O
the O
street O
, O
even O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
the O
jealous O
anguish O
that O
filled O
his O
heart O
, O
his O
conscience O

     | O
smote O
him O
. O
He O
had O
not O
done O
enough O
to O
save O
her O
. O
One B-CARDINAL
more O
effort O
, O

she O
might O
have O
come O
. O
Nay O
, O
|
     | O
twenty B-CARDINAL
efforts O
would O
have O
been O
well O
rewarded O
by O
her O
yielding O
. O
He O
turned O
back O
, O
but O
she O
was O
gone O
. O
|
     | O
In O
the O
tumult O
of O
his O
other O
feelings O
, O
his O
self O
- O
reproach O
was O
deadened O
for O
the O
time O
. O
But O
many O
and O
|
     | O
many O
a O
day O
afterwards O
he O
bitterly O
regretted O
his O
omission O
of O
duty O
  O
his O
weariness O
of O

     | O
well O
- O
doing O
. O
| 
  | O
Now O
, O
the O
great O
thing O
was O
to O
reach O
home O
, O
and O
solitude O
. O
Mary B-PERSON
loved O
another O
! O
Oh O
! O
how O
should O
he O
|
     | O
bear O
it O
? O
He O
had O
thought O
her O
rejection O
of O
him O
a O
hard O
trial O
, O
but O
that O
was O
nothing O
now O
. O
He O
only O
|
     | O
remembered O
it O
, O
to O
be O
thankful O
he O
had O
not O
yielded O
to O
the O
temptation O
of O
trying O
his O
fate O
again O
, O
|
     | O
not O
in O
actual O
words O
, O
but O
in O
a O
meeting O
, O
where O
her O
manner O
should O
tell O
far O
more O
than O
words O

her O
sweeter O
smiles O

gladden O

And O
he O
must O
live O
on O
  O
that O
seemed O
the O
strangest O
. O
That O
a O
long O

     | O
life O

long O

even O
with O
deep O
, O
biting O
sorrow O
corroding O
at O
their O
hearts O
) O

     | O
must O
be O
spent O
without O
Mary B-PERSON
  O

, O
with O
the O
consciousness O

was O
another O
's O
! O
That O
hell O
of O
thought O

     | O

would O
reserve O
for O
the O
quiet O
of O
his O
own O
room O
, O
the O
dead O
stillness O
of O
night O

He O
was O
on O
the O

     | O
threshold O
of O
home O

He O
entered O

There O
were O
the O
usual O
faces O

the O
usual O
sights O

He O
loathed O
them O
, O
and O
then O
he O
cursed O

     | O
himself O
because O
he O
loathed O
them O
. O
His O
mother O
's O
love O
had O
taken O
a O
cross O
turn O
, O

the O
tempting O
supper O

prepared O
for O

, O
her O

     | O
dulled O
senses O
deadening O
day O
by O
day O

sat O
mutely O
near O
the O
fire O
  O
her O
happiness O
, O
bounded O
by O
the O

     | O
circle O
of O
the O
consciousness O
of O
the O
presence O
of O
her O
foster O
child O
, O
knowing O
that O
his O
voice O

     | O
repeated O
what O
was O
passing O
to O
her O
deafened O
ear O

that O
his O
arm O
removed O

And O
Will O
, O
out O
of O
the O
very O
kindness O

his O
heart O
, O
talked O
more O

more O
merrily O

     | O
than O
ever O

He O
saw O
Jem B-PERSON
was O
downcast O
, O

fancied O
his O
rattling O
might O
cheer O
him O
  O
at O
any O
rate O
, O
it O

     | O
drowned O
his O
aunt O

grumblings O

in O
some O
measure O
concealed O
the O
blank O
of O
the O
evening O

At O
last O
, O
bed O

time O
came O
  O

withdrew O

neighbouring O
lodging O

Jane B-PERSON

raked O

up O

There O
was O
no O

by O
one B-CARDINAL
strong O
effort O
of O
his O
right O

, O
a O
heavy O
chest O
was O

     | O
moved O
against O
it O

he O
could O
sit O
down O
on O
the O
side O

think O

Mary B-PERSON
loved O
another O
! O
That O
idea O
would O
rise O
uppermost O
in O
his O
mind O

had O
to O
be O
combated O
in O
all O

     | O
its O
forms O
of O
pain O

It O
was O
, O
perhaps O
, O
no O

wonder O

such O

She O

knowing O

Jem O

     | O
pictured O
him O

lying O

listening O
to O
the O

     | O
upbraiding O
accusation O
of O
his O
murderer O

How O
he O
had O
left O
his O
own O
rank O

and O
dared O
to O
love O
a O
maiden O

     | O
of O
low O
degree O
  O
and O
— O
oh O
! O
stinging O
agony O
of O
all O
— O
how O
she O
, O
in O
return O
, O
had O
loved O
him O
! O
Then O
the O
other O

     | O
nature O
spoke O
up O

bade O
him O
remember O
the O
anguish O

At O

     | O
refused O

that O
better O
voice O

listened O
only O

He O
would O
glory O
in O
her O

     | O
wailing O
grief O

he O
would O
take O
pleasure O
in O
her O
desolation O
of O
heart O
! O

  | O
No O
! O
he O
could O
not O
, O
said O
the O
still O
small O
voice O

It O
would O
be O
worse O

far O
worse O

     | O
such O

it O
was O
now O
to O
bear O
his O
present O
heavy O
burden O

But O
it O
was O
too O
heavy O
, O
too O
grievous O
to O
be O
borne O

He O
would O
slay O
himself O

he O
with O
his O

at O

Had O
he O
not O
promised O
with O
such O
earnest O
purpose O
of O
soul O

more O

Should O
he O
shrink O
from O
the O

guard O
Mary B-PERSON

Would O
it O

He O
braced O
up O
his O

said O

himself O

And O
now O
the O

Poor O

the O
conclusion O

that O
Mr. O

Carson B-PERSON

evil O

no O

entertained O
that O

, O
to O

very O
probable O
, O

     | O
that O
he O
might O
only O

She O
was O
a O

     | O
was O
the O
great O
reason O
for O
doubting O
his O

  | O
There O
might O
probably O
be O
some O
little O
awkwardness O
about O
the O
affair O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
: O
Mary B-PERSON

father O

     | O
having O
such O
strong O
prejudices O
on O
the O
one O

something O

on O
the O

something O
to O
exert O

Oh O

why O

this O

It O
was O
beyond O

Why O

     | O
had O

The O
answer O
came O
when O
he O
was O
calm O
enough O
to O
listen O
for O
it O

Because O
Mary B-PERSON

acted O

The O

a O
Communist B-NORP
, O
all O
that O
is O
commonly O
called O
wild O

visionary O
. O
|
     | O
Ay O
! O
but O
being O
visionary O
is O
something O
. O
It O
shows O
a O
soul O
, O
a O
being O
not O
altogether O
sensual O
  O
a O

     | O
creature O

looks O
forward O
for O

if O
not O
for O
himself O

  | O
And O
with O
all O
his O
weakness O
he O
had O
a O
sort O
of O
practical O
power O
, O
which O
made O
him O
useful O
to O
the O
|
     | O
bodies O
of O
men O
to O
whom O
he O
belonged O
. O
He O
had O
a O
ready O
kind O
of O
rough O
Lancashire B-PERSON
eloquence O
, O
arising O
|
     | O
out O
of O
the O
fulness O
of O
his O
heart O
, O
which O
was O
very O
stirring O
to O
men O
similarly O
circumstanced O
, O
who O
|
     | O
liked O
to O
hear O
their O
feelings O
put O
into O
words O
. O
He O
had O
a O
pretty O
clear O
head O
at O
times O
, O
for O
method O
|
     | O
and O
arrangement O
  O
a O
necessary O
talent O
to O
large O
combinations O
of O
men O
. O
And O
what O
perhaps O
more O
than O
|
     | O
all O
made O
him O
relied O
upon O
and O
valued O
, O
was O
the O
consciousness O
which O
every O
one O
who O
came O
in O
contact O
|
     | O
with O
him O
felt O
, O
that O
he O
was O
actuated O
by O
no O
selfish O
motives O
  O
that O
his O
class O
, O
his O
order O
, O
was O
what O
|
     | O
he O
stood O
by O
, O
not O
the O
rights O
of O
his O
own O
paltry O
self O
. O
For O
even O
in O
great O
and O
noble O
men O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
|
     | O
self O
comes O
into O
prominent O
existence O
, O
it O
becomes O
a O
mean O
and O
paltry O
thing O
. O
| 
  | O
A O
little O
time O
before O
this O
, O
there O
had O
come O
one O
of O
those O
occasions O
for O
deliberation O
among O
the O
|
     | O
employed O
, O
which O
deeply O
interested O
John B-PERSON
Barton I-PERSON
  O
and O
the O
discussions O
concerning O
which O
had O
caused O
|
     | O
his O
frequent O
absence O
from O
home O
of O
late O
. O
| 
  | O
I O
am O
not O
sure O
if O
I O
can O
express O
myself O
in O
the O
technical O
terms O
of O
either O
masters O
or O
workmen O
, O
|
     | O
but O
I O
will O
try O
simply O
to O
state O
the O
case O
on O
which O
the O
latter O
deliberated O
. O
| 
  | O
An O
order O
for O
coarse O
goods O
came O
in O
from O
a O
new O
foreign O
market O
. O
It O
was O
a O
large O
order O
, O
giving O
|
     | O
employment O
to O
all O
the O
mills O
engaged O
in O
that O
species O
of O
manufacture O
: O
but O
it O
was O
necessary O
to O
|
     | O
execute O
it O
speedily O
, O
and O
at O
as O
low O
prices O
as O
possible O
, O
as O
the O
masters O
had O
reason O
to O
believe O
a O
|
     | O
duplicate O
order O
had O
been O
sent O
to O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
continental O
manufacturing O
towns O
, O
where O
there O
were O
|
     | O
no O
restrictions O
on O
food O
, O
no O
taxes O
on O
building O
or O
machinery O
, O
and O
where O
consequently O
they O
dreaded O
|
     | O
that O
the O
goods O
could O
be O
made O
at O
a O
much O
lower O
price O
than O
they O
could O
afford O
them O
for O
  O
and O
that O
, O
|
     | O
by O
so O
acting O
and O
charging O
, O
the O
rival O
manufacturers O
would O
obtain O
undivided O
possession O
of O
the O
|
     | O
market O
. O
It O
was O
clearly O
their O
interest O
to O
buy O
cotton O
as O
cheaply O
, O
and O
to O
beat O
down O
wages O
as O
low O
|
     | O
as O
possible O
. O
And O
in O
the O
long O
run O
the O
interests O
of O
the O
workmen O
would O
have O
been O
thereby O
|
     | O
benefited O
. O
Distrust O
each O
other O
as O
they O
may O
, O
the O
employers O
and O
the O
employed O
must O
rise O
or O
fall O
|
     | O
together O
. O
There O
may O
be O
some O
difference O
as O
to O
chronology O
, O
none O
as O
to O
fact O
. O
| 
  | O
But O
the O
masters O
did O
not O
choose O
to O
make O
all O
these O
facts O
known O
. O
They O
stood O
upon O
being O
the O
|
     | O
masters O
, O
and O
that O
they O
had O
a O
right O
to O
order O
work O
at O
their O
own O
prices O
, O
and O
they O
believed O
that O
in O
|
     | O
the O
present O
depression O
of O
trade O
, O
and O
unemployment O
of O
hands O
, O
there O
would O
be O
no O
great O
difficulty O
|
     | O
in O
getting O
it O
done O
. O
| 
  | O
Now O
let O
us O
turn O
to O
the O
workmen O
's O
view O
of O
the O
question O
. O
The O
masters O
( O
of O
the O
tottering O
|
     | O
foundation O
of O
whose O
prosperity O
they O
were O
ignorant O
) O
seemed O
doing O
well O
, O
and O
like O
gentlemen O
, O
|
     | O
" O
lived O
at O
home O
in O
ease O
, O
" O
while O
they O
were O
starving O
, O
gasping O
on O
from B-DATE
day I-DATE
to I-DATE
day I-DATE
  O
and O
there O
was O
a O
|
     | O
foreign O
order O
to O
be O
executed O
, O
the O
extent O
of O
which O
, O
large O
as O
it O
was O
, O
was O
greatly O
exaggerated O
  O
|
     | O
and O
it O
was O
to O
be O
done O
speedily O
. O
Why O
were O
the O
masters O
offering O
such O
low O
wages O
under O
these O
|
     | O
circumstances O
? O
Shame O
upon O
them O
! O
It O
was O
taking O
advantage O
of O
their O
work O
- O
people O
being O
almost O
|
     | O
starved O
  O
but O
they O
would O
starve O
entirely O
rather O
than O
come O
into O
such O
terms O
. O
It O
was O
bad O
enough O
to O
|
     | O
be O
poor O
, O
while O
by O
the O
labour O
of O
their O
thin O
hands O
, O
the O
sweat O
of O
their O
brows O
, O
the O
masters O
were O
|
     | O
made O
rich O
  O
but O
they O
would O
not O
be O
utterly O
ground O
down O
to O
dust O
. O
No O
! O
they O
would O
fold O
their O
hands O
, O
|
     | O
and O
sit O
idle O
, O
and O
smile O
at O
the O
masters O
, O
whom O
even O
in O
death O
they O
could O
baffle O
. O
With O
Spartan B-NORP
|
     | O
endurance O
they O
determined O
to O
let O
the O
employers O
know O
their O
power O
, O
by O
refusing O
to O
work O
. O
| 
  | O
So O
class O
distrusted O
class O
, O
and O
their O
want O
of O
mutual O
confidence O
wrought O
sorrow O
to O
both O
. O
The O
|
     | O
masters O
would O
not O
be O
bullied O
, O
and O
compelled O
to O
reveal O
why O
they O
felt O
it O
wisest O
and O
best O
to O
offer O
|
     | O
only O
such O
low O
wages O
  O
they O
would O
not O
be O
made O
to O
tell O
that O
they O
were O
even O
sacrificing O
capital O
to O

a O
decisive O
victory O
over O
the O
continental O

And O
the O

sat O
silent O

stern O
with O

coming O
in O
as O

     | O
a O
motive O
for O
speech O
  O
her O
eyes O
had O
always O
been O
soft O
, O
and O
were O
in O
no O
ways O
disfigured O
by O
her O
|
     | O
blindness O
, O
and O
now O
seemed O
to O
have O
a O
new O
charm O
, O
as O
they O
quivered O
under O
their O
white O
down O
- O
cast O
|
     | O
lids O
. O
She O
must O
be O
conscious O
, O
thought O
Mary,—heart O
answering O
heart O

Will O

no O
blushings O
, O
no O
downcast O
eyes O

no O
weighing O
of O
words O
  O
it O
was O
as O
open O
and O
|
     | O
undisguised O
as O
his O
nature O
  O
yet O
he O
seemed O
afraid O
of O
the O
answer O
its O
acknowledgment O
might O
meet O
|
     | O
with O
. O
It O
was O
Margaret B-PERSON
's O
angelic O
voice O
that O
had O
entranced O
him O
, O
and O
which O
made O
him O
think O
of O
her O
|
     | O
as O
a O
being O
of O
some O
other O
sphere O
, O
that O
he O
feared O
to O
woo O
. O
So O
he O
tried O
to O
propitiate O
Job O
in O
all O
|
     | O
manner O
of O
ways O
. O
He O
went O
over O
to O
Liverpool B-GPE
to O
rummage O
in O
his O
great O
sea O
- O
chest O
for O
the O
flying O
- O
fish O
|
     | O
( O
no O
very O
odorous O
present O
by O
the O
way O
) O
. O
He O
hesitated O
over O
a O
child O
's O
caul O
for O
some O
time O
, O
which O
|
     | O
was O
, O
in O
his O
eyes O
, O
a O
far O
greater O
treasure O
than O
any O
Exocetus B-ORG
. O
What O
use O
could O
it O
be O
of O
to O
a O
|
     | O
landsman O
? O
Then O
Margaret B-PERSON
's O
voice O
rang O
in O
his O
ears O
  O
and O
he O
determined O
to O
sacrifice O
it O
, O
his O
most O
|
     | O
precious O
possession O
, O
to O
one O
whom O
she O
loved O
, O
as O
she O
did O
her O
grandfather O
. O
| 
  | O
It O
was O
rather O
a O
relief O
to O
him O
, O
when O
, O
having O
put O
it O
and O
the O
flying O
- O
fish O
together O
in O
a O
brown O
|
     | O
paper O
parcel O
, O
and O
sat O
upon O
them O
for O
security O
all O
the O
way O
in O
the O
railroad O
, O
he O
found O
that O
Job B-PERSON
was O
|
     | O
so O
indifferent O
to O
the O
precious O
caul O
, O
that O
he O
might O
easily O
claim O
it O
again O
. O
He O
hung O
about O
|
     | O
Margaret B-PERSON
, O
till O
he O
had O
received O
many O
warnings O
and O
reproaches O
from O
his O
conscience O
in O
behalf O
of O
|
     | O
his O
dear O
aunt O
Alice B-PERSON
's O
claims O
upon O
his O
time O
. O
He O
went O
away O
, O
and O
then O
he O
bethought O
him O
of O
some O
|
     | O
other O
little O
word O
with O
Job O
. O
And O
he O
turned O
back O
, O
and O
stood O
talking O
once O
more O
in O
Margaret B-PERSON
's O
|
     | O
presence O
, O
door O
in O
hand O
, O
only O
waiting O
for O
some O
little O
speech O
of O
encouragement O
to O
come O
in O
and O
sit O
|
     | O
down O
again O
. O
But O
as O
the O
invitation O
was O
not O
given O
, O
he O
was O
forced O
to O
leave O
at O
last O
, O
and O
go O
and O
do O
|
     | O
his O
duty O
. O
| 
  | O
Four B-DATE
days I-DATE
had O
Jem B-PERSON
Wilson I-PERSON
watched O
for O
Mr. O
Harry B-PERSON
Carson I-PERSON
without O
success O
  O
his B-TIME
hours I-TIME
of O
going O
and O
|
     | O
returning O
to O
his O
home O
were O
so O
irregular O
, O
owing O
to O
the O
meetings O
and O
consultations O
among O
the O

     | O
masters O
, O
which O
were O
rendered O
necessary O
by O
the O
turn O

out O

On O
the O
fifth B-ORDINAL
, O
without O
any O

on O
|
     | O
Jem B-PERSON
's O
part O
, O
they O
met O
. O
| 
  | O
It O
was O
the O
workmen O
's O
dinner O
- O
hour O
, O
the O
interval O
between O
twelve O
and O
one O
  O
when O
the O
streets O
of O
|
     | O
Manchester B-FAC
are O
comparatively O
quiet O
, O
for O
a O
few O
shopping O
ladies O

lounging O
gentlemen O
count O
for O

     | O
nothing O
in O
that O
busy O

bustling O

Jem B-PERSON
had O
been O
on O
an O
errand O
for O
his O
master O
, O
instead O

     | O
of O
returning O
to O
his O
dinner O
  O
and O
in O
passing O
along O
a O
lane O

a O
road O
( O
called O

in O
compliment O
to O
the O

intentions O
of O
some O
future O
builder O
, O
a O
street O
) O
, O
he O
encountered O
Harry B-PERSON
Carson I-PERSON
, O
the O
only O
person O
, O
as O
|
     | O
far O
as O
he O
saw O
beside O
himself O
, O
treading O
the O
unfrequented O
path O
. O
Along O
one O
side O
ran O
a O
high O
broad O
|
     | O
fence O
, O
blackened O
over O
by O
coal O
- O
tar O
, O
and O
spiked O
and O
stuck O
with O
pointed O
nails O
at O
the O
top O
, O
to O
|
     | O
prevent O
any O
one O
from O
climbing O
over O
into O
the O
garden O
beyond O
. O
By O
this O
fence O
was O
the O
foot O
- O
path O
. O
The O
|
     | O
carriage O
road O
was O
such O
as O
no O
carriage O
, O
no O
, O
not O
even O
a O
cart O
, O
could O
possibly O
have O
passed O
along O
, O
|
     | O
without O
Hercules B-GPE
to O
assist O
in O
lifting O
it O
out O
of O
the O
deep O
clay O
ruts O
. O
On O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
|
     | O
way O
was O
a O
dead O
brick O
wall O
  O
and O
a O
field O
after O
that O
, O
where O
there O
was O
a O
sawpit O
, O
and O
joiner O
's O
|
     | O
shed O
. O
| 
  | O
Jem B-PERSON
's O
heart O
beat O
violently O
when O
he O
saw O
the O
gay O
, O
handsome O
young O
man O
approaching O
, O
with O
a O
light O
, O
|
     | O
buoyant O
step O
. O
This O
, O
then O
, O
was O
he O
whom O
Mary B-PERSON
loved O
. O
It O
was O
, O
perhaps O
, O
no O
wonder O
  O
for O
he O
seemed O
to O
|
     | O
the O
poor O
smith O
so O
elegant O
, O
so O
well O
- O
appointed O
, O
that O
he O
felt O
his O
superiority O
in O
externals O
, O
|
     | O
strangely O
and O
painfully O
, O
for O
an O
instant O
. O
Then O
something O
uprose O
within O
him O
, O
and O
told O
him O
, O
that O
|
     | O
" O
a O
man O
's O
a O
man O
for O
a O
' O
that O
, O
for O
a O
' O
that O
, O
and O
twice O
as O
much O
as O
a O
' O
that O
. O
" O
And O
he O
no O
longer O
felt O
|
     | O
troubled O
by O
the O
outward O
appearance O
of O
his O
rival O
. O
| 
  | O
Harry B-PERSON
Carson I-PERSON
came O
on O
, O
lightly O
bounding O
over O
the O
dirty O
places O
with O
almost O
a O
lad O
's O
buoyancy O
. O
To O
|
     | O
his O
surprise O
the O
dark O
, O
sturdy O
- O
looking O
artisan O
stopped O
him O
by O
saying O
respectfully O
, O
| 
  | O
" O
May O
I O
speak O
a O
word O
wi O
' O
you O
, O
sir O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Certainly O
, O
my O
good O
man O
, O
" O
looking O
his O
astonishment O
  O
then O
finding O
that O
the O
promised O
speech O
did O
|
     | O
not O
come O
very O
quickly O
, O
he O
added O
, O
" O
But O
make O
haste O
, O
for O
I O
'm O
in O
a O
hurry O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Jem B-PERSON
had O
cast O
about O
for O
some O
less O
abrupt O
way O
of O
broaching O
the O
subject O
uppermost O
in O
his O
mind O
|
     | O
than O
he O
now O
found O
himself O
obliged O
to O
use O
. O
With O
a O
husky O
voice O
that O
trembled O
as O
he O
spoke O
, O
he O
|
     | O
said O
, O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
think O
, O
sir O
, O
yo're O
keeping O
company O
wi O

young O
woman O
called O
Mary B-PERSON
Barton I-PERSON

" O
| 
  | O
A O
light O
broke O
in O
upon O
Harry B-PERSON
Carson I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
mind O
, O
and O
he O
paused O
before O
he O
gave O
the O
answer O
for O
which O
|
     | O
the O
other O
waited O
. O
| 
  | O
Could O
this O
man O
be O
a O
lover O
of O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
? O
And O
( O
strange O
, O
stinging O
thought O
) O
could O
he O
be O
beloved O
by O
|
     | O
her O
, O
and O
so O
have O
caused O
her O
obstinate O
rejection O
of O
himself O
? O
He O
looked O
at O
Jem B-PERSON
from O
head O
to O
foot O
, O
|
     | O
a O
black O
, O
grimy O
mechanic O
, O
in O
dirty O
fustian O
clothes O
, O
strongly O
built O
, O
and O
awkward O
( O
according O
to O
|
     | O
the O
dancing O
- O
master O
) O
  O
then O
he O
glanced O
at O
himself O
, O
and O
recalled O
the O
reflection O
he O
had O
so O
lately O
|
     | O
quitted O
in O
his O
bed O
- O
room O
. O
It O
was O
impossible O
. O
No O
woman O
with O
eyes O
could O
choose O
the O
one O
when O
the O

     | O
other O
wooed O

was O
Hyperion B-ORG
to O
a O

That O
quotation O
came O
aptly O

forgot O

here O

ask O

Jem B-PERSON

voice O
quivered O
with O
the O
earnestness O
with O

     | O
which O
he O
spoke O
, O

he O
eagerly O
waited O
for O
some O
answer O

Harry B-PERSON
Carson I-PERSON
, O
meanwhile O
, O
instead O
of O
attending O
very O
particularly O
to O
the O
purpose O
the O
man O
had O
in O
|
     | O
addressing O
him O
, O
was O
trying O
to O
gather O
from O
his O
speech O
what O
was O
the O
real O
state O
of O
the O
case O
. O
He O
|
     | O
succeeded O
so O
far O
as O
to O
comprehend O
that O
Jem B-PERSON
inclined O
to O
believe O
that O
Mary B-PERSON
loved O
his O
rival O
  O
and O
|
     | O
consequently O
, O
that O
if O
the O
speaker O
were O
attached O
to O
her O
himself O
, O
he O
was O
not O
a O
favoured O
admirer O

     | O
The O
idea O
came O
into O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON
's O
mind O
, O
that O
perhaps O
, O
after O
all O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
loved O
him O
in O
spite O
of O
her O
|
     | O
frequent O
and O
obstinate O
rejections O
  O
and O
that O
she O
had O
employed O
this O
person O
( O
whoever O
he O
was O
) O
to O
|
     | O
bully O
him O
into O
marrying O
her O
. O
He O
resolved O
to O
try O
and O
ascertain O
more O
correctly O
the O
man O
's O
relation O
|
     | O
to O
her O
. O
Either O
he O
was O
a O
lover O
, O
and O
if O
so O
, O
not O
a O
favoured O
one O
( O
in O
which O
case O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON
could O
|
     | O
not O
at O
all O
understand O

the O

this O

     | O
last O
supposition O

None O
came O
  O
so O
he O
began O

be O
threatened O
into O
some O

engagement O

     | O
they O
fell O

talking O

There O
might O

     | O
twenty B-CARDINAL

     | O
the O

who O
, O
nevertheless O
, O
were O
sufficiently O
interested O

These O
were O
divided O
into O
little O
groups O
, O
who O
did O
not O
seem O
unanimous O
by O
any O

Some O

     | O
were O
for O
a O
slight O
concession O
, O
just O
a O
sugar O

quieten O
the O

a O
sacrifice O

quietness O

Some O
were O
steadily O

vehemently O
opposed O
to O
the O
dangerous O
precedent O
of O

     | O
yielding O
one B-CARDINAL

teaching O

how O
to O
become O

Did O
they O
want O
the O
wildest O
thing O

they O

     | O
would O
know O
that O
the O
way O
to O
obtain O
their O
wishes O
would O
be O
to O
strike O

where O
one O
of O
the O

had O
been O

     | O
tried O
for O
a O
cruel O
assault O
on O
a O
poor O
north O

country O
weaver O
, O
who O
had O
attempted O
to O
work O
at O
the O
low O

     | O
price O
. O
They O
were O
indignant O
, O
and O
justly O
so O
, O
at O
the O
merciless O
manner O
in O
which O
the O
poor O
fellow O
had O

     | O
been O
treated O
  O
and O
their O
indignation O
at O
wrong O
, O
took O
( O
as O
it O
so O
often O
does O
) O
the O
extreme O
form O
of O

     | O
revenge O
. O
They O
felt O
as O
if O
, O
rather O
than O
yield O
to O
the O
body O
of O
men O
who O
were O
resorting O
to O
such O
cruel O

     | O
measures O
towards O
their O
fellow O

workmen O
, O

in O
order O
that O
the O
workmen O
might O

     | O
suffer O
keenly O
. O
They O
forgot O
that O
the O
strike O
was O
in O
this O
instance O
the O
consequence O
of O
want O
and O

     | O
need O
, O
suffered O
unjustly O
, O
as O
the O

believed O
  O
for O

however O
insane O
, O
and O
without O
ground O
of O

     | O
reason O
, O
such O
was O
their O
belief O
, O
and O
such O
was O
the O
cause O
of O
their O
violence O
. O
It O
is O
a O
great O
truth O
, O

     | O
that O
you O
can O
not O
extinguish O
violence O
by O
violence O
. O
You O
may O
put O
it O
down O
for O
a O
time O
  O

while O
you O

     | O
are O
crowing O
over O
your O
imaginary O

openly O

that O

The O
room O
was O
not O
large O
, O
but O
its O

     | O
bareness O
of O
furniture O
made O
it O
appear O
so O
. O
Unshaded O
gas O
flared O
down O
upon O
the O
lean O

     | O
artisans O
as O
they O
entered O

' O
ultimatum O

adding O
thereunto O
not O
one O
word O
of O
their O

  O
and O

     | O
it O
sank O
all O
the O
deeper O
into O
the O
sore O
hearts O
of O
the O

entered O

You O
would O
have O
been O
puzzled O

what O
was O
the O
state O
of O
his O

He O
looked O
so O

so O
far O
from O

The O
impression O

would O
have O
given O
you O
would O
have O
been O
unfavourable O

yet O
there O
was O
much O
about O
him O
that O

He O
smirked O

sat O
down O

but O
walked O
up O

down O
continually O
like O
a O
wild O

in O
his O

. O
At O

he O

     | O
bethought O
him O
on O
a O
way O
to O
help O

and O
he O
got O

and O
he O
humbly O
axed O
him O
to O
forgive O

     | O
him O
. O
So O
I O
did O
what O
Jonas B-PERSON
wished O
. O
But O
bless O
your O
life O
, O
none O
on O

would O
ever O
throw O

again O

     | O
( O
at O

at O
a O

if O
they O
could O
see O
the O
sight O
I O
saw O
to O
- O
day O
. O
The O
man O
lay O
, O
his O
face O
all O
|
     | O
wrapped O
in O
cloths O
, O
so O
I O
did O
n't O
see O

that O

  O
but O
not O
a O
limb O
, O
nor O
a O
bit O
of O
a O

, O
could O
|
     | O
keep O
from O
quivering O
with O
pain O
. O
He O
would O
ha O
' O
bitten O
his O
hand O
to O
keep O
down O
his O
moans B-NORP

but O
|
     | O
could O
n't O
, O
his O
face O
hurt O
him O
so O
if O
he O
moved O
it O
e'er O
so O
little O
. O
He O
could O
scarce O
mind O
me O
when O
I O
|
     | O
telled O
him O
about O
Jonas B-ORG
  O
he O
did O
squeeze O
my O
hand O
when O
I O
jingled O
the O
money O
, O
but O
when O
I O
axed O
his O

     | O
wife O
's O

he O
shrieked O
out O
, O
' O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
shall O
I O
never O
see O
you O

Mary B-PERSON
, O
my O

     | O
they O
've O
made O
me O
blind O
because O
I O
wanted O

for O
you O

our O
own O

  O
oh O
, O
Mary B-PERSON

' O
Then O
|
     | O
the O
nurse O
came O
, O
and O
said O
he O
were O
raving O
, O
and O
that O
I O
had O
made O
him O
worse O

And O
I O
'm O
afeard O
it O
was O

     | O
true O
  O
yet O
I O
were O
loth O
to O
go O
without O
knowing O
where O

So O
that O

my O

" O

" O
Did O
yo O
hear O
where O

" O
asked O
many O
anxious O
voices O

" O
No O

he O
went O
on O
talking O
to O
her O
, O
till O
his O
words O
cut O
my O
heart O
like O
a O

. O
I O
axed O
th O

find O
out O
who O
she O
was O
, O

But O
what O
I O

more O
especial O
naming O

now O
for O
is O

     | O
this,—for O

There O
were O

" O

I O

we O
're O
more O
cowardly O

now O
, O
may O

growled O
another O

And O
so O
with O
words O
, O
or O
looks O
that O
told O
more O
than O
words O
, O
they O
built O
up O
a O
deadly O
plan O
. O
Deeper O
|
     | O
and O
darker O
grew O
the O
import O
of O
their O
speeches O
, O
as O
they O
stood O
hoarsely O
muttering O
their O
meaning O

     | O
out O
, O
and O
glaring O
, O
with O
eyes O
that O

in O

themselves O

Then O
came O
one O
of O

Then O
, O
under O
the O
flaring O

, O
they O
met O
together O
to O
consult O
further O
. O
With O
the O

     | O
distrust O
of O

was O

torn O
up O

one O

Then O
all O

folded O
up O
again O

looking O

exactly O
alike O

They O
were O
shuffled O
together O
in O

The O

out O
a O

Then O
each O
went O
as O
far O
as O
he O
could O
from O
his O
fellows O

examined O

Then O

still O

up O

it O

very O
sudden O
on O
me O

had O
got O
so O
fond O

you O

Mary B-PERSON
understood O
the O

spoke O
again O

it O

, O
you O

I O

a O

it O

" O

sadly O
. O
" O
I O
sometimes O

never O

that O

It O

away O

now O
, O
there O

hardly O
a O

creature O
that O
crosses O

has O
something O
sad O

unhappy O

     | O
evening O

" O
| 
  | O
Mary B-PERSON
sighed O
, O
for O
the O
feeling O
again O
came O
over O
her O
that O
it O

flat O

" O
You O

no O
one O
crosses O
the O
threshold O

has O
something O
sad O
to O

  O
you O
do O
n't O
mean O
that O

     | O
Margaret B-PERSON
Jennings I-PERSON
has O
any O
trouble O

" O
asked O
the O
young O
sailor O
, O
anxiously O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
No O
! O
" O
replied O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
smiling O
a O
little O
, O
" O
she O
's O
the O
only O
one O
I O
know O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
who O
seems O
free O

     | O
from O
care O
. O
Her O
blindness O
almost O
appears O
a O
blessing O
sometimes O
  O
she O
was O
so O
downhearted O
when O
she O
|
     | O
dreaded O
it O
, O
and O
now O
she O
seems O
so O
calm O
and O
happy O
when O
it O
's O
downright O
come O
. O
No O
! O
Margaret B-PERSON
's O
happy O
, O

     | O
I O
do O
think O

  | O
" O
I O
could O
almost O
wish O
it O
had O
been O
otherwise O

thoughtfully O
. O
" O
I O
could O
have O

so O

     | O
glad O
to O
comfort O
her O

cherish O
her O

if O

been O
in O
trouble O

" O

" O
And O
why O
ca O
n't O
you O
cherish O
her O
, O
even O
though O
she O
is O
happy O

" O
asked O
Mary B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Oh O
! O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O
She O
seems O
so O
much O
better O
than O
I O
am O
! O
And O
her O
voice O
! O
When O
I O
hear O
it O
, O
and O
|
     | O
think O
of O
the O
wishes O
that O
are O
in O
my O
heart O
, O
it O
seems O
as O
much O
out O
of O
place O
to O
ask O
her O
to O
be O
my O
|
     | O
wife O
, O
as O
it O
would O
be O
to O
ask O
an O
angel O
from O
heaven O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Mary B-PERSON
could O
not O
help O
laughing O
outright O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
her O
depression O
, O
at O
the O
idea O
of O
Margaret B-PERSON
as O
|
     | O
an O
angel O
  O
it O
was O
so O
difficult O
( O
even O
to O
her O
dress O
- O
making O
imagination O
) O
to O
fancy O
where O
, O
and O
how O
, O
|
     | O
the O
wings O
would O
be O
fastened O
to O
the O
brown O
stuff O
gown O
, O
or O
the O
blue O
and O
yellow O
print O
. O
| 
  | O
Will O
laughed O
, O
too O
, O
a O
little O
, O
out O
of O
sympathy O
with O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
pretty O
merry O
laugh O
. O
Then O
he O
|
     | O
said O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
Ay O
, O
you O
may O
laugh O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
  O
it O
only O
shows O
you O

never O
been O
in O
love O

" O
| 
  | O
In O
an O
instant O
Mary B-PERSON
was O
carnation O
colour O
, O
and O
the O
tears O
sprang O
to O
her O
soft O
gray O
eyes O
  O
she O
was O
|
     | O
suffering O
so O
much O
from O
the O
doubts O
arising O
from O
love O
! O
It O
was O
unkind O
of O
him O
. O
He O
did O
not O
notice O
|
     | O
her O
change O
of O
look O
and O
of O
complexion O
. O
He O
only O
noticed O
that O
she O
was O
silent O
, O
so O
he O
continued O
: O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
thought O
— O
I O
think O
, O
that O
when O
I O
come O
back O
from O
this O
voyage O
, O
I O
will O
speak O

It O
's O
my O
fourth B-ORDINAL

     | O
voyage O
in O
the O
same O
ship O

with O
the O

captain O

he O

'll O
make O
me O
second B-ORDINAL
mate O

     | O
after O
this O
trip O
  O
then O
I O
shall O
have O
something O
to O
offer O
Margaret B-PERSON
  O
and O
her O
grandfather O
, O
and O
aunt O

     | O
Alice B-PERSON
, O
shall O
live O
with O
her O
, O
to O
keep O
her O
from O
being O
lonesome O
while O
I O
'm O
at O
sea O
. O
I O
'm O
speaking O
as O

     | O
if O
she O
cared O
for O
me O
, O
and O
would O
marry O
me O
  O
d'ye O
think O
she O
does O
care O
at O
all O
for O
me O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
? O
" O
asked O
|
     | O
he O
, O
anxiously O
. O
| 
  | O
Mary B-PERSON
had O
a O
very O
decided O
opinion O
of O
her O
own O
on O
the O
subject O
, O
but O
she O
did O
not O
feel O
as O
if O
she O
had O
|
     | O
any O
right O
to O
give O
it O
. O
So O
she O
said O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
You O
must O
ask O
Margaret B-PERSON
, O
not O
me O
, O
Will O
  O
she O
's O
never O
named O
your O
name O
to O
me O
. O
" O
His O
countenance O
|
     | O
fell O
. O
" O
But O
I O
should O
say O
that O
was O
a O
good O
sign O
from O
a O
girl O

her O

I O
've O
no O
right O

what O
I O

     | O
think O
  O
but O
, O
if O
I O
was O
you O
, O
I O
would O
not O
leave O
her O
now O
without O
speaking O
. O
" O

  | O
" O
No O
! O
I O
can O
not O
speak O
! O
I O
have O
tried O

I O
've O
been O
in O
to O
wish O
them O
good O
- O
bye O
, O
and O
my O
voice O
stuck O
in O

     | O
my O
throat O
. O
I O
could O
say O
nought O
of O
what O
I O
'd O
planned O
to O
say O
  O

I O
never O

as O
to O
offer O
her O

been O
my O
next O

could O
not O

her O
this O
box O

his O
paper O

a O
gaudily O
ornamented O
accordion O

     | O
" O
I O
longed O
to O
buy O
her O
something O

I O

the O

" O

She O

And O
so O
good O

a O

ill O

that O

, O
for O

Them O

happy O

How O
pleased O
I O
used O
to O
be O
when O
she O

take O
me O
into O
the O

her O

I O
've O
tasted O

it O
was O

half B-CARDINAL

their O

She O
used O

tell O
me O
long O
stories O
about O
her O
childhood O

and O
we O
used O
to O

found O
all O
sadly O
changed O

" O
said O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
though O
her O
heart O
echoed O
Will B-PERSON
's O

     | O
feeling O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Ay O

One B-CARDINAL
thing O
I O
do O
wish O
though O
, O
and O
I O
have O
often O
wished O
it O
when O

     | O
out O
alone O
on O
the O
deep O
sea O
, O
when O
even O
the O
most O
thoughtless O
ca O
n't O
choose O
but O
think O
on O
th O
' O
past O

     | O
and O
th O
' O
future O
  O
and O
that O
is O

that O
I O
'd O
never O
grieved O
her O

Oh O
Mary B-PERSON
! O
many O
a O
hasty O
word O
comes O

     | O
sorely O
back O
on O
the O
heart O
, O
when O
one O
thinks O
one B-CARDINAL
shall O
never O
see O
the O
person O
whom O
one O
has O
grieved O

     | O
again O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
They O
both O
stood O
thinking O
. O
Suddenly O
Mary B-PERSON
started O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
That O

father O

step O

And O
his O

" O
| 
  | O
She O
hurried O
to O
her O
irons O
, O
and O
tried O
to O
make O
up O
for O
lost O
time O
. O

  | O
John B-PERSON
Barton I-PERSON
came O
in O
. O
Such O
a O
haggard O
and O
wildly O
anxious O
looking O
man O
, O
Will O
thought O
he O
had O
never O

     | O
seen O
. O
He O
looked O
at O
Will O
, O
but O
spoke O
no O
word O
of O
greeting O
or O
welcome O
. O

  | O
" O
I O
'm O
come O
to O
bid O
you O
good O
bye O
, O
" O
said O
the O
sailor O
, O
and O
would O
in O
his O
sociable O
friendly O
humour O
|
     | O
have O
gone O
on O
speaking O
. O
But O
John B-PERSON
answered O
abruptly O
, O
| 
  | O
" O
Good O
bye O
to O
ye O
, O
then O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
There O
was O
that O
in O
his O
manner O
which O
left O
no O
doubt O
of O
his O
desire O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
the O
visitor O
, O
and O
|
     | O
Will O
accordingly O
shook O
hands O
with O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
and O
looked O
at O
John B-PERSON
, O
as O
if O
doubting O
how O
far O
to O
offer O
to O

     | O
shake O
hands O
with O
him O
. O
But O
he O
met O
with O
no O
answering O
glance O
or O
gesture O
, O
so O
he O
went O
his O
way O
, O
|
     | O
stopping O
for O
an O
instant O
at O
the O
door O
to O
say O
, O

" O
You O

Jack B-PERSON

     | I-PERSON
Harris I-PERSON
says O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Mary B-PERSON
was O
heartily O
sorry O
when O
the O
door O
closed O
  O
it O
seemed O
like O
shutting O
out O
a O
friendly O
sunbeam O
. O
|
     | O
And O
her O
father O
! O
what O
could O
be O
the O
matter O
with O
him O
? O
He O
was O
so O
restless O
  O
not O
speaking O
( O
she O
wished O

     | O
he O
would O
) O
, O
but O
starting O
up O
and O
then O
sitting O
down O
, O
and O
meddling O
with O
her O
irons O
  O
he O
seemed O
so O
|
     | O
fierce O
, O
too O
, O
to O
judge O
from O
his O
face O
. O
She O
wondered O
if O
he O
disliked O
Will O
being O
there O
  O
or O
if O
he O
|
     | O
were O
vexed O
to O
find O
that O
she O
had O
not O
got O
further O
on O
with O
her O
work O
. O
At O
last O
she O
could O
bear O
his O
|
     | O
nervous O
way O
no O
longer O
, O
it O
made O
her O
equally O
nervous O
and O
fidgetty O
. O
She O
would O
speak O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
When O
are O
you O
going O
, O
father O
? O
I O
do O

" O

  | O
" O
And O
why O
shouldst O
thou O
know O
? O
" O
replied O
he O
, O
gruffly O
. O
" O
Meddle O
with O
thy O
ironing O
, O
but O
donnot O
be O

     | O

thee O

" O

" O
I O
wanted O
to O
get O
you O
something O
to O
eat O
first B-ORDINAL

answered O
she O
, O
gently O
. O

  | O
" O
Thou B-PERSON
dost O
not O
know O
that O

said O
he O
. O
| 
  | O
Mary B-PERSON
looked O
at O
him O
to O
see O
if O
he O
spoke O
jestingly O
. O
No O
! O
he O
looked O
savagely O
grave O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
finished O
her O
bit O
of O
ironing O
, O
and O
began O
preparing O
the O
food O
she O
was O
sure O
her O
father O
needed O
  O

     | O
for O
by O
this O
time O
her O
experience O
in O
the O
degrees O
of O
hunger O
had O
taught O
her O
that O
his O
present O
|
     | O
irritability O
was O
increased O
, O
if O
not O
caused O
, O
by O
want O
of O
food O
. O
| 
  | O
He O
had O
had O
a O
sovereign O
given O
him O
to O
pay O
his O
expenses O
as O
delegate O
to O
Glasgow B-PERSON
, O
and O
out O
of O
this O

     | O
he O
had O
given O
Mary B-PERSON
a O
few O
shillings O
in O
the B-TIME
morning I-TIME
  O
so O
she O
had O
been O
able O
to O
buy O
a O
sufficient O

     | O
meal O
, O
and O
now O
her O
care O
was O
to O
cook O
it O
so O
as O
most O
to O
tempt O
him O
. O

  | O
" O

" O
Just O
a O
little O
bit O

before O

coaxed O
Mary B-PERSON

perseveringly O

At O
that O

when O
he O
did O

     | O
pay O
visits O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
knew O
from O
past O
experience O

were O
any O
thing O

short O
. O
Her O
father O
's O

     | O
countenance O
fell O
back O
into O
the O
deep O
gloom O
from O
which O
it O
was O
but O
just O
emerging O
at O
the O
sound O
of O
|
     | O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
sweet O
voice O
, O
and O
pretty O
pleading O

He O
became O
again O
restless O

fidgetty O
, O
scarcely O
giving O

     | O
Job O

the O

however O
, O
did O
not O
stand O
upon O

     | O
ceremony O

He O
had O
come O
to O
pay O
a O
visit O
, O
and O
was O
not O
to O
be O
daunted O
from O
his O
purpose O
. O
He O
was O

     | O
interested O
in O
John B-PERSON
Barton I-PERSON

mission O
to O
Glasgow B-PERSON
, O
and O
wanted O
to O
hear O
all O
about O
it O
  O
so O
he O
sat O
|
     | O
down O
, O
and O
made O
himself O
comfortable O
, O
in O
a O
manner O
that O
Mary B-PERSON
saw O
was O
meant O
to O
be O
stationary O

  | O
" O
So O
thou'rt O
off O
to O
Glasgow B-GPE
, O
art O
thou O
? O
" O
he O
began O
his O
catechism O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Ay O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
When O
art O
starting O

" O

  | O
" O
To O
- O
night O

" O
| 
  | O
" O
That O
I O
knowed O

by O
what O
train O

" O
| 
  | O
That O
was O
just O
what O
Mary B-PERSON
wanted O
to O
know O
  O

what O
apparently O
her O
father O
was O
in O
no O
mood O
to O
|
     | O
tell O
. O
He O
got O
up O
without O
speaking O
, O
and O
went O
up O
- O
stairs O
. O
Mary B-PERSON
knew O
from O
his O
step O

his O
way O
, O
how O

     | O
much O
he O
was O
put O
out O

feared O

see O
it O

too O

But O
no O

Job O
seemed O
imperturbable O

So O

     | O
much O
the O
better O
, O
and O
perhaps O
she O
could O
cover O
her O

him O

turned O
to O
her O

in O
a O
short O
cold O
manner O

he O

her O
away O

She O
followed O
him O
to O
the O

hard O

Suddenly O
, O

     | O
at O

he O
unlaced O
her O
soft O
twining O
arms O

kissing O
her O
once O
more O
, O
set O
off O
on O
his O
fierce O

     | O
errand O

And O
he O
was O
out O
of O
sight O

She O
did O
not O
know O
why O

she O

never O
before O

so O
depressed O

so O

desolate O

She O
turned O
in O
to O
Job B-LOC

sat O
there O
still O

Her O
father O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
was O
out O

     | O
sight O
, O
slackened O
his O
pace O
, O
and O
fell O
into O
that O
heavy O
listless O
step O
, O
which O
told O
as O
well O
as O
words O

     | O
could O
do O
, O
of O
hopelessness O
and O
weakness O
. O
It O
was O
getting O
dark O
, O
but O
he O
loitered O
on O
, O
returning O
no O

     | O
greeting O
to O
any O
one O
. O
| 
  | O
A O
child O
's O
cry O
caught O
his O
ear O
. O
His O
thoughts O
were O
running O
on O
little O
Tom B-PERSON

on O
the O
dead O

buried O

child O

years O

He O
followed O
the O
sound O
of O
the O
wail O

that O
might O
have O
been O

his O

, O

found O
a O
poor O
little O
mortal O
, O
who O

lost O
his O
way O

grief O

choked O
up O

     | O
thoughts O

the O

" O

" O
With O
tender O
address O
, O
John B-PERSON
Barton I-PERSON
soothed O
the O
|
     | O
little O
laddie O
, O
and O
with O
beautiful O
patience O
he O
gathered O
fragments O
of O
meaning O
from O
the O
half B-CARDINAL
|
     | O
spoken O
words O
which O
came O
mingled O
with O
sobs O
from O
the O
terrified O
little O
heart O
. O
So O
, O
aided O
by O
|
     | O
inquiries O
here O
and O
there O
from O
a O
passer O
- O
by O
, O
he O
led O
and O
carried O
the O
little O
fellow O
home O
, O
where O
his O

     | O
mother O
had O
been O
too O
busy O
to O
miss O
him O
, O
but O
now O
received O
him O
with O
thankfulness O
, O
and O
with O
an O
|
     | O
eloquent O
Irish B-NORP
blessing O
. O
When O
John B-PERSON
heard O
the O
words O
of O
blessing O
, O
he O
shook O
his O
head O
mournfully O
, O
|
     | O
and O
turned O
away O
to O
retrace O
his O
steps O
. O
| 
  | O
Let O
us O
leave O
him O
. O
| 
  | O
Mary B-PERSON
took O
her O
sewing O
after O
he O
had O
gone O
, O
and O
sat O
on O
, O
and O
sat O
on O
, O
trying O
to O
listen O
to O
Job B-PERSON
, O
who O
|
     | O
was O
more O
inclined O
to O
talk O
than O
usual O
. O
She O
had O
conquered O
her O
feeling O
of O
impatience O
towards O
him O
|
     | O
so O
far O
as O
to O
be O
able O
to O
offer O
him O
her O
father O
's O
rejected O
supper O
  O
and O
she O
even O
tried O
to O
eat O
|
     | O
herself O
. O
But O
her O
heart O
failed O
her O
. O
A O
leaden O
weight O
seemed O
to O
hang O
over O
her O
  O
a O
sort O
of O
|
     | O
presentiment O
of O
evil O
, O
or O
perhaps O
only O
an O
excess O
of O
low O
- O
spirited O
feeling O
in O
consequence O
of O
the O
|
     | O
two B-CARDINAL
departures O
which O
had O
taken O
place O
that B-TIME
afternoon I-TIME
. O
| 
  | O
She O
wondered O
how O
long O
Job B-PERSON
Legh I-PERSON
would O
sit O
. O
She O
did O
not O
like O
putting O
down O
her O
work O
, O
and O
crying O

     | O
before O
him O
, O
and O
yet O
she O
had O
never O
in O
her O
life O
longed O
so O
much O
to O
be O
alone O
in O
order O
to O
indulge O
in O
|
     | O
a O
good O
hearty O
burst O
of O
tears O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Well O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
" O
she O
suddenly O
caught O
him O
saying O
, O
" O
I O
thought O
you O
'd O
be O
a O
bit O
lonely O
to O

and O

     | O
as O

going O
to O

     | O
a O
very O
pleasant O
, O
chatty O
evening O

've O
had O
  O
very O
. O
Only O
I O
wonder O
as O

not O

     | O
back O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
But O
perhaps O
she O
is O

" O
suggested O
Mary B-PERSON
. O

" O
No O

took O

and O
he O
pulled O
out O
the O
great O
house O

" O
She O
'll O

" O

At O
first O
I O
were O
afraid O

a O

But O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
the O
old O
man O
's O
mind O
could O
only O
take O
in O
the O
idea O
of O
death O
  O
slowly O
, O
|
     | O
slowly O
came O
the O
conception O
of O
violence O
, O
of O
murder O
. O
" O
How O
did O
he O
die O
? O
" O
he O
groaned O
forth O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
policemen O
looked O
at O
each O
other O
. O
Then O
one O
began O
, O
and O
stated O
that O
having O
heard O
the O
report O

     | O
of O
a O
gun O
in O
Turner B-FAC
Street I-FAC
, O
he O
had O
turned O
down O
that O
way O
( O
a O
lonely O
, O
unfrequented O
way O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON

     | O
knew O
, O
but O
a O
short O
cut O
to O
his O
garden O
- O
door O
, O
of O
which O
Harry B-PERSON
had O
a O
key O
) O
  O
that O
as O
he O
( O
the O
policeman O
) O
|
     | O
came O
nearer O
, O
he O
had O
heard O
footsteps O
as O
of O
a O
man O
running O
away O
  O
but O
the B-TIME
evening I-TIME
was O
so O
dark O
( O
the O
|
     | O
moon O
not O
having O
yet O
risen O
) O
that O
he O
could O
see O
no B-QUANTITY
one I-QUANTITY
twenty I-QUANTITY
yards I-QUANTITY
off O
. O
That O
he O
had O
even O
been O
|
     | O
startled O
when O
close O
to O
the O
body O
by O
seeing O
it O
lying O
across O
the O
path O
at O
his O
feet O
. O
That O
he O
had O
|
     | O
sprung O
his O
rattle O
  O
and O
when O
another O
policeman O
came O
up O
, O
by O
the O
light O
of O
the O
lantern O
they O
had O
|
     | O
discovered O
who O
it O
was O
that O
had O
been O
killed O
. O
That O
they O
believed O
him O
to O
be O
dead O
when O
they O
first B-ORDINAL
|
     | O
took O
him O
up O
, O
as O
he O
had O
never O
moved O
, O
spoken O
, O
or O
breathed O
. O
That O
intelligence O
of O
the O
murder O
had O
|
     | O
been O
sent O
to O
the O
superintendent O
, O
who O
would O
probably O
soon O
be O
here O
. O
That O
two B-CARDINAL
or I-CARDINAL
three I-CARDINAL
policemen O
|
     | O
were O
still O
about O
the O
place O
where O
the O
murder O
was O
committed O
, O
seeking O
out O
for O
some O
trace O
of O
the O
|
     | O
murderer O
. O
Having O
said O
this O
, O
they O
stopped O
speaking O
. O
| 
  | O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON
had O
listened O
attentively O
, O
never O
taking O
his O
eyes O
off O
the O
dead O
body O
. O
When O
they O
had O
|
     | O
ended O
, O
he O
said O
, O
| 
  | O
" O
Where O
was O
he O
shot O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
They O
lifted O
up O
some O
of O
the O
thick O
chestnut O
curls O
, O
and O
showed O
a O
blue O
spot O
( O
you O
could O
hardly O
|
     | O
call O
it O
a O
hole O
, O
the O
flesh O
had O
closed O
so O
much O
over O
it O
) O
in O
the O
left O
temple O
. O
A O
deadly O
aim O
! O
And O
yet O
|
     | O
it O
was O
so O
dark O
a O
night O
! O
| 
  | O
" O
He O
must O
have O
been O
close O
upon O
him O
, O
" O
said O
one B-CARDINAL
policeman O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
And O
have O
had O
him O
between O
him O
and O
the O
sky O
, O
" O
added O
the O
other O
. O
| 
  | O
There O
was O
a O
little O
commotion O
at O
the O
door O
of O
the O
room O
, O
and O
there O
stood O
poor O
Mrs. O
Carson B-PERSON
, O
the O
|
     | O
mother O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
had O
heard O
unusual O
noises O
in O
the O
house O
, O
and O
had O
sent O
down O
her O
maid O
( O
much O
more O
a O
companion O
|
     | O
to O
her O
than O
her O
highly O
- O
educated O
daughters O
) O
to O
discover O
what O
was O
going O
on O
. O
But O
the O
maid O
either O
|
     | O
forgot O
, O
or O
dreaded O
, O
to O
return O
  O
and O
with O
nervous O
impatience O
Mrs. O
Carson B-PERSON
came O
down O
herself O
, O
and O
|
     | O
had O
traced O
the O
hum O
and O
buzz O
of O
voices O
to O
the O
servants O
' O
hall O
. O
| 
  | O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON
turned O
round O
. O
But O
he O
could O
not O
leave O
the O
dead O
for O
any O
one B-CARDINAL
living O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Take O
her O
away O
, O
nurse O
. O
It O
is O
no O
sight O
for O
her O
. O
Tell O
Miss O
Sophy O
to O
go O
to O
her O
mother O
. O
" O
His O
eyes O
|
     | O
were O
again O
fixed O
on O
the O
dead O
face O
of O
his O
son O
. O
| 
  | O
Presently O
Mrs. O
Carson B-PERSON
's O
hysterical O
cries O
were O
heard O
all O
over O
the O
house O
. O
Her O
husband O
shuddered O
|
     | O
at O
the O
outward O
expression O
of O
the O
agony O
which O
was O
rending O
his O
heart O
. O
| 
  | O
Then O
the O
police O
superintendent O
came O
, O
and O
after O
him O
the O
doctor O
. O
The O
latter O
went O
through O
all O
|
     | O
the O
forms O
of O
ascertaining O
death O
, O
without O
uttering O
a O
word O
, O
and O
when O
at O
the O
conclusion O
of O
the O
|
     | O
operation O
of O
opening O
a O
vein O
, O
from O
which O
no O
blood O
flowed O
, O
he O
shook O
his O
head O
, O
all O
present O
|
     | O
understood O
the O
confirmation O
of O
their O
previous O
belief O
. O
The O
superintendent O
asked O
to O
speak O
to O
Mr. O
|
     | O
Carson B-PERSON
in O
private O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
It O
was O
just O
what O
I O
was O
going O
to O
request O
of O
you O
, O
" O
answered O
he O
  O
so O
he O
led O
the O
way O
into O
the O
|
     | O
dining O
- O
room O
, O
with O
the O
wine O
- O
glass O
still O
on O
the O
table O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
door O
was O
carefully O
shut O
, O
and O
both O
sat O
down O
, O
each O
apparently O
waiting O
for O
the O
other O
to O
|
     | O
begin O
. O
| 
  | O
At O
last O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON
spoke O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
You O
probably O
have O
heard O
that O
I O
am O
a O
rich O
man O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
The O
superintendent O
bowed O
in O
assent O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Well O
, O
sir O
, O
half B-CARDINAL
— O
nay O
, O
if O
necessary O
, O
the O
whole O
of O
my O
fortune O
I O
will O
give O
to O
have O
the O
murderer O
|
     | O
brought O
to O
the O
gallows O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Every O
exertion O
, O
you O
may O
be O
sure O
, O
sir O
, O
shall O
be O
used O
on O
our O
part O
  O
but O
probably O
offering O
a O
|
     | O
handsome O
reward O
might O
accelerate O
the O
discovery O
of O
the O
murderer O
. O
But O
what O
I O
wanted O
particularly O
|
     | O
to O
tell O
you O
, O
sir O
, O
is O
that O
one O
of O
my O
men O
has O
already O
got O
some O
clue O
, O
and O
that O
another O
( O
who O
|
     | O
accompanied O
me O
here O
) O
has O
within O
this B-DATE
quarter I-DATE
of O
an O
hour O
found O
a O
gun O
in O
the O
field O
which O
the O
|
     | O
murderer O
crossed O
, O
and O
which O
he O
probably O
threw O
away O
when O
pursued O
, O
as O
encumbering O
his O
flight O
. O
I O
|
     | O
have O
not O
the O
smallest O
doubt O
of O
discovering O
the O
murderer O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
What O
do O
you O
call O
a O
handsome O
reward O
? O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Well O
, O
sir O
, O
three B-CARDINAL
, O
or O
five B-QUANTITY
hundred I-QUANTITY
pounds I-QUANTITY
is O
a O
munificent O
reward O
: O
more O
than O
will O
probably O
be O

     | O
required O
as O
a O
temptation O
to O
any O
accomplice O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Make O
it O
a O
thousand O
, O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON
, O
decisively O
. O
" O
It O
's O
the O
doing O
of O
those O
damned O

     | O
turn O

outs O

" O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
imagine O
not O

" O
said O
the O
superintendent O
. O
" O
Some B-DATE
days I-DATE
ago I-DATE
the O
man O
I O
was O
naming O
to O
you O
before O
, O
|
     | O
reported O
to O
the O
inspector O
when O
he O
came O
on O
his O
beat O
, O
that O
he O
had O
had O
to O
separate O
your O
son O
from O
a O
|
     | O
young O
man O
, O
who O
by O
his O
dress O
he O
believed O
to O
be O
employed O
in O
a O
foundry O
  O
that O
the O
man O
had O
thrown O

     | O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON
down O
, O
and O
seemed O
inclined O
to O
proceed O
to O
more O
violence O
, O
when O
the O
policeman O
came O
up O
|
     | O
and O
interfered O
. O
Indeed O
, O
my O
man O
wished O
to O
give O
him O
in O
charge O
for O
an O
assault O
, O
but O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON
|
     | O
would O
not O
allow O
that O
to O
be O
done O
. O
" O

  | O
" O
Just O
like O
him!—noble O
fellow O
! O
" O
murmured O
the O
father O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
But O
after O
your O
son O
had O
left O

the O
man O
made O
use O
of O
some O
pretty O
strong O
threats O
. O
And O
it O
's O
rather O
|
     | O
a O
curious O
coincidence O
that O
this O
scuffle O
took O
place O
in O
the O
very O
same O
spot O
where O
the O
murder O
was O

     | O
committed O
  O
in O
Turner B-FAC
Street I-FAC

" O

There O
was O
some O
one O
knocking O
at O
the O
door O
of O
the O
room O

It O
was O
Sophy B-PERSON

who O
beckoned O
her O
father O

out O

then O
asked O
him O

in O
an O

" O
She O

And O
the O
poor O

sobbed O
bitterly O

" O
Where O

" O
asked O
Mr. O

In O
his O
room O

They O
went O
up O
stairs O
rapidly O
and O
silently O
. O
It O
was O
a O
large O
, O
comfortable O
bedroom O
  O
too O
large O
to O

     | O
be O
well O
lighted O
by O
the O
flaring O
, O
flickering O
kitchen O
- O
candle O
which O
had O
been O
hastily O
snatched O
up O

now O
stood O
on O
the O
dressing O

On O
the O
bed O
, O
surrounded O
by O
its O
heavy O
, O
pall O
- O
like O
green O
curtains O
, O
lay O
the O
dead O
son O

They O
had O

     | O
carried O
him O
up O
, O

laid O
him O
down O

as O
tenderly O
as O

they O
feared O
to O
waken O
him O
  O
and O
, O
indeed O
, O
|
     | O
it O
looked O
more O
like O
sleep O
than O
death O
, O
so O
very O
calm O
and O
full O
of O
repose O
was O
the O
face O

You O
saw O
, O

     | O
too O
, O
the O
chiselled O
beauty O
of O
the O
features O
much O
more O
perfectly O
than O
when O
the O
brilliant O
colouring O
|
     | O
of O
life O
had O
distracted O
your O
attention O
. O
There O
was O
a O
peace O
about O
him O
which O
told O
that O
death O
had O

     | O
come O
too O

to O
give O
any O
previous O

In O
a O
chair O

at O
the O
head O
of O
the O
bed O

sat O
the O
mother,—smiling O

She O
held O
one O

the O
hands O

( O
rapidly O
stiffening O
, O
even O
in O
her O
warm O
grasp O
) O
, O
and O
gently O
stroked O
the O
back O

it O

with O
the O

betimes O
this B-TIME
morning I-TIME
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Mary B-PERSON
could O
do O
nothing O
but O
feel O
guilty O
of O
her O
long O
morning B-TIME
nap O
, O
and O
hasten O
to O
follow O
|
     | O
Margaret B-PERSON
's O
steps O
  O
for O
late O
as O
it O
was O
, O
she O
felt O
she O
could O
not O
settle O
well O
to O
her O
work O
, O
unless O
|
     | O
she O
learnt O
how O
kind O
good O
Alice B-PERSON
Wilson I-PERSON
was O
going O
on O
. O
| 
  | O
So O
, O
eating O
her O
crust O
- O
of O
- O
bread O
breakfast O
, O
she O
passed O
rapidly O
along O
the O
streets O
. O
She O
remembered O
|
     | O
afterwards O
the O
little O
groups O
of O
people O
she O
had O
seen O
, O
eagerly O
hearing O
, O
and O
imparting O
news O
  O
but O
|
     | O
at O
the O
time O
her O
only O
care O
was O
to O
hasten O
on O
her O
way O
, O
in O
dread O
of O
a O
reprimand O
from O
Miss O
|
     | O
Simmonds O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
went O
into O
the O
house O
at O
Jane B-PERSON
Wilson I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
, O
her O
heart O
at O
the O
instant O
giving O
a O
strange O
knock O
, O
|
     | O
and O
sending O
the O
rosy O
flush O
into O
her O
face O
, O
at O
the O
thought O
that O
Jem B-PERSON
might O
possibly O
be O
inside O
the O
|
     | O
door O
. O
But O
I O
do O
assure O
you O
, O
she O
had O
not O
thought O
of O
it O
before O
. O
Impatient O
and O
loving O
as O
she O
was O
, O
|
     | O
her O
solicitude O
about O
Alice B-PERSON
on O
that O
hurried O
morning O
had O
not O
been O
mingled O
with O
any O
thought O
of O
|
     | O
him O
. O
| 
  | O
Her O
heart O
need O
not O
have O
leaped O
, O
her O
colour O
need O
not O
have O
rushed O
so O
painfully O
to O
her O
cheeks O
, O
|
     | O
for O
he O
was O
not O
there O
. O
There O
was O
the O
round O
table O
, O
with O
a O
cup O
and O
saucer O
, O
which O
had O
evidently O
|
     | O
been O
used O
, O
and O
there O
was O
Jane B-PERSON
Wilson I-PERSON
sitting O
on O
the O
other O
side O
, O
crying O
quietly O
, O
while O
she O
ate O
|
     | O
her O
breakfast O
with O
a O
sort O
of O
unconscious O
appetite O
. O
And O
there O
was O
Mrs. O
Davenport B-PERSON
washing O
away O
at O
|
     | O
a O
night O
- O
cap O
or O
so O
, O
which O
, O
by O
their O
simple O
, O
old O
- O
world O
make O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
knew O
at O
a O
glance O
were O
Alice B-PERSON
's O
. O
|
     | O
But O
nothing O
— O
no O
one O
else O
. O
| 
  | O
Alice B-PERSON
was O
much O
the O
same O
, O
or O
rather O
better O
of O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
, O
they O
told O
her O
  O
at O
any O
rate O
she O
could O
|
     | O
speak O
, O
though O
it O
was O
sad O
rambling O
talk O
. O
Would O
Mary O
like O
to O
see O
her O
? O
| 
  | O
Of O
course O
she O
would O
. O
Many O
are O
interested O
by O
seeing O
their O
friends O
under O
the O
new O
aspect O
of O
|
     | O
illness O
  O
and O
among O
the O
poor O
there O
is O
no O
wholesome O
fear O
of O
injury O
or O
excitement O
to O
restrain O
this O
|
     | O
wish O
. O
| 
  | O
So O
Mary B-PERSON
went O
up O
- O
stairs O
, O
accompanied O
by O
Mrs. O
Davenport B-PERSON
, O
wringing O
the O
suds O
off O
her O
hands O
, O
and O
|
     | O
speaking O
in O
a O
loud O
whisper O
far O
more O
audible O
than O
her O
usual O
voice O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
mun O
be O
hastening O
home O
, O
but O
I O
'll O
come O
again O
to O
- O
night O
, O
time O
enough O
to O
iron O
her O
cap O
  O
' O
twould O
|
     | O
be O
a O
sin O
and O
a O
shame O
if O
we O
let O
her O
go O
dirty O
now O
she O
's O
ill O
, O
when O
she O
's O
been O
so O
rare O
and O
clean O
|
     | O
all O
her O
life O
- O
long O
. O
But O
she O
's O
sadly O
forsaken O
, O
poor O
thing O
! O
She O
'll O
not O
know O
you O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
  O
she O
knows O
|
     | O
none O
on O
us O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
The O
room O
up O
- O
stairs O
held O
two B-CARDINAL
beds O
, O
one B-CARDINAL
superior O
in O
the O
grandeur O
of O
four B-CARDINAL
posts O
and O
checked O
|
     | O
curtains O
to O
the O
other O
, O
which O
had O
been O
occupied O
by O
the O
twins O
in O
their O
brief O
life O
- O
time O
. O
The O
|
     | O
smaller O
had O
been O
Alice B-PERSON
's O
bed O
since O
she O
had O
lived O
there O
  O
but O
with O
the O
natural O
reverence O
to O
one B-CARDINAL
|
     | O
" O
stricken O
of O
God O
and O
afflicted O
, O
" O
she O
had O
been O
installed O
since O
her O
paralytic O
stroke O
the O
evening O
|
     | O
before O
in O
the O
larger O
and O
grander O
bed O
, O
while O
Jane B-PERSON
Wilson I-PERSON
had O
taken O
her O
short O
broken O
rest O
on O
the O
|
     | O
little O
pallet O
. O
| 
  | O
Margaret B-PERSON
came O
forwards O
to O
meet O
her O
friend O
, O
whom O
she O
half B-CARDINAL
expected O
, O
and O
whose O
step O
she O
knew O
. O
|
     | O
Mrs. O
Davenport B-PERSON
returned O
to O
her O
washing O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
two B-CARDINAL
girls O
did O
not O
speak O
  O
the O
presence O
of O
Alice B-ORG
awed O
them O
into O
silence O
. O
There O
she O
lay O
with O
|
     | O
the O
rosy O
colour O
, O
absent O
from O
her O
face O
since O
the B-DATE
days I-DATE
of O
childhood O
, O
flushed O
once O
more O
into O
it O
by O
|
     | O
her O
sickness O
nigh O
unto O
death O
. O
She O
lay O
on O
the O
affected O
side O
, O
and O
with O
her O
other O
arm O
she O
was O
|
     | O
constantly O
sawing O
the O
air O
, O
not O
exactly O
in O
a O
restless O
manner O
, O
but O
in O
a O
monotonous O
, O
incessant O
|
     | O
way O
, O
very O
trying O
to O
a O
watcher O
. O
She O
was O
talking O
away O
, O
too O
, O
almost O
as O
constantly O
, O
in O
a O
low O
, O
|
     | O
indistinct O
tone O
. O
But O
her O
face O
, O
her O
profiled O
countenance O
, O
looked O
calm O
and O
smiling O
, O
even O

     | O
interested O
by O
the O
ideas O
that O
were O
passing O
through O
her O
clouded O
mind O

  | O
" O

said O
Margaret B-PERSON

as O
she O
stooped O
her O
head O
down O
to O
catch O
the O

down O
the O

part O
of O
last B-TIME

, O
and O
just O
when O
she O
were O
in O
a O
sound O
sleep O
this B-TIME
morning I-TIME
, O

     | O
between B-CARDINAL
two I-CARDINAL
and I-CARDINAL
three I-CARDINAL
, O
Jem B-PERSON
came O
home O
, O
and O
th O
' O
sound O
o O
' O
his O
voice O
roused O
her O
in O
a O
minute O
. O
" O

  | O
" O
Where O
had O
he O
been O
till O
that O
time O
o O
' O
night O
? O
" O
asked O
Mary B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Nay O
! O
it O
were O
none O
of O
my O
business O
  O
and O
, O
indeed O
, O
I O
never O
saw O
him O
till O
he O
came O
in O
here O
to O
see O
|
     | O
Alice O
. O
He O
were O
in O
again O
this B-TIME
morning I-TIME
, O
and O
seemed O
sadly O
downcast O
. O
But O
you O
'll O
, O
may O
be O
, O
manage O
to O
|
     | O
comfort O
him O
to O
- O
night O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
Margaret B-PERSON
, O
smiling O
, O
while O
a O
ray O
of O
hope O
glimmered O
in O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
|
     | O
heart O
, O
and O
she O
almost O
felt O
glad O
, O
for O
an O
instant O
, O
of O
the O
occasion O
which O
would O
at O
last O
bring O
them O
|
     | O
together O
. O
Oh O
! O
happy O
night O
! O
when O
would O
it O
come O
? O
Many B-TIME
hours I-TIME
had O
yet O
to O
pass O
. O
| 
  | O
Then O
she O
saw O
Alice B-PERSON
, O
and O
repented O
, O
with O
a O
bitter O
self O
- O
reproach O
. O
But O
she O
could O
not O
help O
having O
|
     | O
gladness O
in O
the O
depths O
of O
her O
heart O
, O
blame O
herself O
as O
she O
would O
. O
So O
she O
tried O
not O
to O
think O
, O
as O
|
     | O
she O
hurried O
along O
to O
Miss O
Simmonds B-PERSON
' O
, O
with O
a O
dancing O
step O
of O
lightness O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
was O
late O
— O
that O
she O
knew O
she O
should O
be O
. O
Miss O
Simmonds B-PERSON
was O
vexed O
and O
cross O
. O
That O
also O
she O
|
     | O
had O
anticipated O
, O
but O
she O
had O
intended O
to O
smooth O
her O
raven O
down O
by O
extraordinary O
diligence O
and O
|
     | O
attention O
. O
But O
there O
was O
something O
about O
the O
girls O
she O
did O
not O
understand O
— O
had O
not O
anticipated O
. O
|
     | O
They O
stopped O
talking O
when O
she O
came O
in O
  O
or O
rather O
, O
I O
should O
say O
, O
stopped O
listening O
, O
for O
Sally B-PERSON
|
     | O
Leadbitter O
was O
the O
talker O
to O
whom O
they O
were O
hearkening O
with O
intense O
attention O
. O
At O
first B-ORDINAL
they O
|
     | O
eyed O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
as O
if O
she O
had O
acquired O
some O
new O
interest O
to O
them O
, O
since O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
before I-DATE
. O
Then O
they O
|
     | O
began O
to O
whisper O
  O
and O
, O
absorbed O
as O
Mary B-PERSON
had O
been O
in O
her O
own O
thoughts O
, O
she O
could O
not O
help O
|
     | O
becoming O
aware O
that O
it O
was O
of O
her O
they O
spoke O
. O
| 
  | O
At O
last O
Sally B-PERSON
Leadbitter I-PERSON
asked O
Mary B-PERSON
if O
she O
had O
heard O
the O
news O
? O
| 
  | O
" O
No O
! O
What O
news O
? O
" O
answered O
she O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
girls O
looked O
at O
each O
other O
with O
gloomy O
mystery O
. O
Sally B-PERSON
went O
on O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Have O
you O
not O
heard O
that O
young O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON
was O
murdered O
last B-TIME
night I-TIME
? O
" O
| 
  | O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
lips O
could O
not O
utter O
a O
negative O
, O
but O
no O
one O
who O
looked O
at O
her O
pale O
and O
terror O
- O
stricken O
|
     | O
face O
could O
have O
doubted O
that O
she O
had O
not O
heard O
before O
of O
the O
fearful O
occurrence O
. O
| 
  | O
Oh O
, O
it O
is O
terrible O
, O
that O
sudden O
information O
, O
that O
one O
you O
have O
known O
has O
met O
with O
a O
bloody O
|
     | O
death O
! O
You O
seem O
to O
shrink O
from O
the O
world O
where O
such O
deeds O
can O
be O
committed O
, O
and O
to O
grow O
sick O
|
     | O
with O
the O
idea O
of O
the O
violent O
and O
wicked O
men O
of O
earth O
. O
Much O
as O
Mary B-PERSON
had O
learned O
to O
dread O
him O
|
     | O
lately O
, O
now O
he O
was O
dead O
( O
and O
dead O
in O
such O
a O
manner O
) O
her O
feeling O
was O
that O
of O
oppressive O
sorrow O

     | O
for O
him O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
room O
went O
round O
and O
round O
, O
and O
she O
felt O
as O
though O
she O
should O
faint O
  O
but O
Miss O
Simmonds B-PERSON
|
     | O
came O
in O
, O
bringing O
a O
waft O
of O
fresher O
air O
as O
she O
opened O
the O
door O
, O
to O
refresh O
the O
body O
, O
and O
the O
|
     | O
certainty O
of O
a O
scolding O
for O
inattention O
to O
brace O
the O
sinking O
mind O
. O
She O
, O
too O
, O
was O
full O
of O
the O

     | O
morning O

news O
. O
| 
  | O
" O

heard O
any O
more O
of O
this O
horrid O
affair O

Miss O
Barton B-PERSON
? O
" O
asked O
she O
, O
as O
she O
settled O
to O
|
     | O
her O
work O
. O
| 
  | O
Mary B-PERSON
tried O
to O
speak O
  O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
she O
could O
not O
, O
and O
when O
she O
succeeded O
in O
uttering O
a O
sentence O
, O
|
     | O
it O
seemed O
as O
though O
it O
were O
not O
her O
own O

that O
spoke O

  | O
" O
No O

" O

that O
's O
strange O
, O
for O
every O
one O

up O
about O
it O

I O
hope O
the O
murderer O

be O
found O
out O

I O

Such O
a O
handsome O
young O
man O

I O
hope O

wretch O

high O

Haman B-PERSON

" O

  | O
One B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
girls O
reminded O
them O
that O
the O
assizes O
came O
on O
next B-DATE
week I-DATE

  | O
" O
Ay O

replied O
Miss O
Simmonds B-PERSON
, O
" O
and O
the O
milk O

me O

     | O
him O

Then O
each O
began O

to O
Miss O

the O
various O
reports O

had O
heard O

Suddenly O
she O
burst O
out O
— O

" O

( O
seeing O
her O

increased O
the O
flow O
of O
Mary B-PERSON

Mary B-PERSON
took O
the O
print O
, O
and O
naturally O
enough O
, O
having O
had O
leave O
given O
her O
to O
cry O
over O
it O
, O
rather O

     | O
checked O
the O
inclination O

weep O
. O
| 
  | O
Every O
body O
was O
full O
of O
the O
one B-CARDINAL

The O
girl O
sent O
out O
to O
match O

came O
back O

about O
the O

mingled O
details O

that O
, O
with O
directions O

     | O
for O
their O

Mary B-PERSON
felt O
as O
though O
the O
haunting O
horror O
were O
a O
nightmare O

a O
fearful O
dream O

relieve O
her O

The O
picture O
of O
the O
murdered O

far O
more O
ghastly O

Sally B-PERSON

looked O

spoke O

her O

almost O
accusingly O
, O

made O
no O
secret O

Mary B-PERSON

fellow O

You O

for O
the O
apprehension O

     | O
the O
murderer O

It O
was O
in O
itself O
a O
temptation O

came O
the O

This O

without O

any O

When O

at O

, O
it O
might O
be O
a O
fellow O

with O
her O
son O

for O
his O
dress O
was O

     | O
grimy O
enough O
for O
the O
supposition O

He O
held O
a O

" O
May O

make O
bold O

She O
first B-ORDINAL
looked O
at O
the O

then O
, O
weary O

half B-CARDINAL
asleep O

not O
seeing O
any O
reason O

     | O
refusing O

she O
moved O

talking O

she O
looked O
for O

     | O
certain O
old O

ill O

and O
me O
left O
all O
alone O
  O
" O
and O
the O
immediate O
cause O
for O
her O

     | O
anxiety O
being O
thus O
recalled O
to O
her O
mind O
, O
she O
entered O
on O
a O
long O
story O
of O
Alice B-PERSON
's O
illness O
, O

     | O
interspersed O
with O
recollections O
of O
her O
husband O

her O
children O
's O
deaths O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
disguised O
policeman O
listened O
for O
a B-TIME
minute I-TIME
or O
two B-CARDINAL
, O
to O
glean O
any O
further O
information O
he O

     | O
could O
  O
and O
then O
, O
saying O
he O
was O
in O
a O
hurry O
, O
he O
turned O
to O
go O
away O
. O
She O
followed O
him O
to O
the O
door O
, O
|
     | O
still O
telling O
him O
her O
troubles O
, O
and O
was O
never O
struck O
, O
until O
it O
was O
too O
late O
to O
ask O
the O
reason O
, O
|
     | O
with O
the O
unaccountableness O
of O
his O
conduct O
, O
in O
carrying O
the O
gun O
away O
with O
him O
. O
Then O
, O
as O
she O
|
     | O
heavily O
climbed O
the O
stairs O
, O
she O
put O
away O
the O
wonder O
and O
the O
thought O
about O
his O
conduct O
, O
by O
|
     | O
determining O
to O
believe O
he O
was O
some O
workman O
with O
whom O
her O
son O
had O
made O
some O
arrangement O
about O
|
     | O
shooting O
at O
the O
gallery O
  O
or O
mending O
the O
old O
weapon O
  O
or O
something O
or O
other O
. O
She O
had O
enough O
to O
|
     | O
fret O
her O
, O
without O
moidering O
herself O
about O
old O
guns O
. O
Jem B-PERSON
had O
given O
it O
him O
to O
bring O
to O
her O
  O
so O
it O
|
     | O
was O
safe O
enough O
  O
or O
, O
if O
it O
was O
not O
, O
why O
she O
should O
be O
glad O
never O
to O
set O
eyes O
on O
it O
again O
, O
for O
|
     | O
she O
could O
not O
abide O
fire O
- O
arms O
, O
they O
were O
so O
apt O
to O
shoot O
people O
. O
| 
  | O
So O
, O
comforting O
herself O
for O
her O
want O
of O
thought O
in O
not O
making O
further O
inquiry O
, O
she O
fell O
off O

     | O
into O
another O
doze O
, O
feverish O
, O
dream O
- O
haunted O
, O
and O
unrefreshing O
. O
| 
  | O
Meanwhile O
, O
the O
policeman O
walked O
off O
with O
his O
prize O
, O
with O
an O
odd O
mixture O
of O
feelings O
  O
a O
little O

     | O
contempt O
, O
a O
little O
disappointment O
, O
and O
a O
good O
deal O
of O
pity O
. O
The O
contempt O
and O
the O
disappointment O
|
     | O
were O
caused O
by O
the O
widow O
's O
easy O
admission O
of O
the O
gun O
being O
her O
son O

and O
her O
manner O

     | O
of O
identifying O
it O
by O
the O
ornaments O
. O
He O
liked O
an O
attempt O

baffle O
him O
  O
he O
was O
accustomed O
to O
it O
  O
|
     | O
it O
gave O
some O
exercise O
to O
his O
wits O

his O
shrewdness O
. O
There O
would O
be O
no O

So O
there O
was O
no O
more O
peace O

, O
except O
to O
Alice B-PERSON
, O
the O

  | O
But O
Mary B-PERSON
knew O
nothing O
of O
the O
afternoon B-TIME
's O
occurrences O
  O
and O
gladly O
did O
she O
breathe O
in O
the O
fresh O
|
     | O
air O
, O
as O
she O
left O
Miss O
Simmonds B-PERSON

The O

     | O
in O
- O
door O
to O
the O
out O
- O
door O
atmosphere O
, O
seemed O
to O
alter O
the O
current O
of O
her O
thoughts O
. O
She O
thought O
|
     | O
less O
of O
the O
dreadful O
subject O
which O
had O
so O
haunted O
her O
all O
day O
  O
she O
cared O
less O
for O
the O
|
     | O
upbraiding O
speeches O
of O
her O
fellow O

  O
the O
old O
association O
of O
comfort O
and O
sympathy O
|
     | O
received O
from O
Alice B-PERSON
gave O
her O
the O
idea O
that O
, O
even O
now O
, O
her O
bodily O
presence O
would O
soothe O
and O
|
     | O
compose O
those O
who O
were O
in O
trouble O
, O
changed O
, O
unconscious O
, O
and O
absent O
though O
her O
spirit O
might O
|
     | O
be O
. O
| 
  | O
Then O
, O
again O
, O
she O
reproached O
herself O
a O
little O
for O
the O
feeling O
of O
pleasure O
she O
experienced O
, O
in O
|
     | O
thinking O
that O
he O
whom O
she O
dreaded O
could O
never O
more O
beset O
her O
path O
  O
in O
the O
security O
with O
which O
|
     | O
she O
could O
pass O
each O
street O
corner O
— O
each O
shop O
, O
where O
he O
used O
to O
lie O
in O
ambush O
. O
Oh O
! O
beating O
heart O
! O
|
     | O
was O
there O
no O
other O
little O
thought O
of O
joy O
lurking O
within O
, O
to O
gladden O
the O
very O
air O
without O
? O
Was O

     | O
she O
not O
going O
to O
meet O
, O
to O
see O
, O
to O
hear O
Jem B-PERSON

could O
they O
fail O
at O
last O
to O
understand O
each O

     | O
other O
's O
loving O
hearts O
! O
| 
  | O
She O
softly O
lifted O
the O
latch O
, O
with O
the O
privilege O
of O
friendship O
. O
|  | O
He O
|  | O
was O
not O
there O
, O
but O
|
     | O
his O
mother O
was O
standing O
by O
the O
fire O
, O
stirring O
some O
little O
mess O
or O
other O
. O
Never O
mind O
! O
he O
would O
|
     | O
come O
soon O
: O
and O
with O
an O
unmixed O
desire O
to O
do O
her O
grateful O
duty O
to O
all O
belonging O
to O
him O
, O
she O
|
     | O
stepped O
lightly O
forwards O
, O
unheard O
by O
the O
old O
lady O
, O
who O
was O
partly O
occupied O
by O
the O
simmering O
, O
|
     | O
bubbling O
sound O
of O
her O
bit O
of O
cookery O
  O
but O
more O
with O
her O
own O
sad O
thoughts O
, O
and O
wailing O
, O

     | O
half B-CARDINAL

uttered O
murmurings O
. O
| 
  | O
Mary B-PERSON
took O
off O
bonnet O
and O
shawl O
with O
speed O
, O
and O
advancing O
, O
made O
Mrs. O
Wilson B-PERSON
conscious O
of O
her O
|
     | O
presence O
, O
by O
saying O
, O

" O

" O
| 
  | O
Mrs. O
Wilson B-PERSON
slowly O
turned O
round O
, O
and O
her O
eyes O
gleamed O
like O
those O
of O
a O
pent O
- O
up O
wild O
beast O
, O
as O
|
     | O
she O
recognised O
her O
visitor O

" O

" O
No O

quivered O
out O
poor O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
scarcely O
conscious O
that O
she O
spoke O

so O
daunted O

slowly O
and O
distinctly O
spoke O
the O
mother O

watching O
the O
effect O

     | O
of O

merciless O
woman O

stopped O
more O
from O
exhaustion O
than O

Mary B-PERSON
spoke O
, O
but O
in O
so O
changed O

choked O

     | O
a O
voice O
that O
the O
old O
woman O
almost O
started O

seemed O

Thou'lt O

my O

thy O

" O
| 
  | O
Harsh O
as O
these O
words O
seem O
, O
she O
spoke O
them O
in O
a O
milder O
tone O
of O
voice O
than O
she O
had O
yet O
used O
. O

     | O
But O
the O
idea O
of O
Jem B-PERSON
on O
the O
gallows O
, O
Jem B-PERSON
dead O
, O
took O
possession O
of O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
and O
she O
covered O
her O
eyes O

     | O
with O
her O
wan O
hands O
, O
as O
if O
indeed O
to O
shut O
out O
the O
fearful O
sight O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
murmured O
some O
words O
, O
which O
, O
though O
spoken O
low O
, O
as O
if O
choked O
up O
from O
the O
depths O
of O
agony O
, O

     | O
Jane B-PERSON
Wilson I-PERSON
caught O
. O
" O
My O

feebly O

" O
My O

" O

  | O
" O
Nonsense O

said O
Mrs. O
Wilson B-PERSON
. O
" O
Do O

in O
that O

way O

But O
, O
oh O
dear O
! O
oh O
dear O
! O
" O
with O
a O
sudden O
revulsion O
|
     | O
of O
feeling O
, O
as O
the O
reality O
of O
the O
danger O
in O
which O
her O
son O
was O
placed O
pressed O
upon O
her O

I O

I O
will O
lie O
down O

" O

  | O
She O
sobbed O
aloud O
with O
bitter O
consciousness O
of O
the O
fearful O
chance O
awaiting O
her O
child O
. O
She O

     | O
cried O
more O
passionately O
still O
. O

  | O
Mary B-PERSON
roused O
herself O
up O

  | O
The O
more O
obstinately O
and O
upbraidingly O
Mrs. O
Wilson B-PERSON
refused O
, O
the O
more O
Mary B-PERSON
pleaded O
, O
with O
ever O

the O

Her O
stunned O
soul O
seemed O
to O
bound O
its O

     | O
wishes O

for O
the B-TIME

at O

to O
remaining O

loved O

no O

Mrs. O

" O

  | O
And O
Mary B-PERSON
turned O
out O
of O
the O
house O

which O
had O
been O

his O

home O

where O

he O

was O
|
     | O
loved O
, O
and O
mourned O
for O
, O
into O
the O
busy O
, O
desolate O
, O
crowded O
street O
, O
where O
they O
were O
crying O

     | O
halfpenny O
broadsides O
, O
giving O
an O
account O
of O
the O
bloody O
murder O

James B-PERSON

  | O
But O
Mary B-PERSON
heard O
not O
, O
she O
heeded O
not O
. O
She O
staggered O
on O
like O
one O
in O
a O
dream O
. O
With O
hung O
head O
and O
|
     | O
tottering O
steps O
, O
she O
instinctively O
chose O
the O
shortest O
cut O
to O
that O
home O
, O
which O
was O
to O
her O
, O
in O
|
     | O
her O
present O
state O
of O
mind O
, O
only O
the O
hiding O
place O
of O
four B-CARDINAL
walls O
, O
where O
she O
might O
vent O
her O
agony O
, O
|
     | O
unseen O
and O
unnoticed O
by O
the O
keen O
, O
unkind O
world O
without O

but O
where O
no O
welcome O
, O
no O
love O
, O
no O

     | O
sympathising O
tears O
awaited O
her O
. O
| 
  | O
As O
she O
neared O
that O
home O
, O
within O
two B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
' O
walk O
of O
it O
, O
her O
impetuous O
course O
was O
arrested O
by O
|
     | O
a O
light O
touch O
on O
her O
arm O
, O
and O
turning O
hastily O
, O
she O
saw O
a O
little O
Italian B-NORP
boy O
with O
his O
humble O
|
     | O
show O
- O
box,—a O
white B-PERSON
mouse I-PERSON
, O
or O
some O
such O
thing O
. O
The O
setting O
sun O
cast O
its O
red O
glow O
on O
his O
face O
, O
|
     | O
otherwise O
the O
olive O
complexion O
would O
have O
been O
very O
pale O
  O
and O
the O
glittering O
tear O
- O
drops O
hung O
on O
|
     | O
the O
long O
curled O
eye O
- O
lashes O
. O
With O
his O
soft O
voice O
and O
pleading O
looks O
, O
he O
uttered O
, O
in O
his O
pretty O
|
     | O
broken O
English B-LANGUAGE
, O
the O
words O
| 
  | O
" O
Hungry O
! O
so O
hungry O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
And O
, O
as O
if O
to O
aid O
by O
gesture O
the O
effect O
of O
the O
solitary O
word O
, O
he O
pointed O
to O
his O
mouth O
, O
with O
|
     | O
its O
white O
quivering O
lips O
. O
| 
  | O
Mary B-PERSON
answered O
him O
impatiently O
, O
| 
  | O
" O
Oh O
, O
lad O
, O
hunger O
is O
nothing O
— O
nothing O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
And O
she O
rapidly O
passed O
on O
. O
But O
her O
heart O
upbraided O
her O
the B-TIME
next I-TIME
minute I-TIME
with O
her O
unrelenting O
|
     | O
speech O
, O
and O
she O
hastily O
entered O
her O
door O
and O
seized O
the O
scanty O
remnant O
of O
food O
which O
the O
|
     | O
cupboard O
contained O
, O
and O
retraced O
her O
steps O
to O
the O
place O
where O
the O
little O
hopeless O
stranger O
had O
|
     | O
sunk O
down O
by O
his O
mute O
companion O
in O
loneliness O
and O
starvation O
, O
and O
was O
raining O
down O
tears O
as O
he O
|
     | O
spoke O
in O
some O
foreign O
tongue O
, O
with O
low O
cries O
for O
the O
far O
distant O
" O
Mamma O
mia O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
With O
the O
elasticity O
of O
heart O
belonging O
to O
childhood O
he O
sprang O
up O
as O
he O
saw O
the O
food O
the O
girl O
|
     | O
brought O
  O
she O
whose O
face O
, O
lovely O
in O
its O
woe O
, O
had O
tempted O
him O
first B-ORDINAL
to O
address O
her O
  O
and O
, O
with O
the O
|
     | O
graceful O
courtesy O
of O
his O
country O
, O
he O
looked O
up O
and O
smiled O
while O
he O
kissed O
her O
hand O
, O
and O
then O
|
     | O
poured O
forth O
his O
thanks O
, O
and O
shared O
her O
bounty O
with O
his O
little O
pet O
companion O
. O
She O
stood O
an O
|
     | O
instant O
, O
diverted O
from O
the O
thought O
of O
her O
own O
grief O
by O
the O
sight O
of O
his O
infantine O
gladness O
  O
and O
|
     | O
then O
bending O
down O
and O
kissing O
his O
smooth O
forehead O
, O
she O
left O
him O
, O
and O
sought O
to O
be O
alone O
with O
|
     | O
her O
agony O
once O
more O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
re O
- O
entered O
the O
house O
, O
locked O
the O
door O
, O
and O
tore O
off O
her O
bonnet O
, O
as O
if O
greedy O
of O
every O
|
     | O
moment O
which O
took O
her O
from O
the O
full O
indulgence O
of O
painful O
, O
despairing O
thought O
. O
| 
  | O
Then O
she O
threw O
herself O
on O
the O
ground O
, O
yes O
, O
on O
the O
hard O
flags O
she O
threw O
her O
soft O
limbs O
down O
  O
|
     | O
and O
the O
comb O
fell O
out O
of O
her O
hair O
, O
and O
those O
bright O
tresses O
swept O
the O
dusty O
floor O
, O
while O
she O
|
     | O
pillowed O
and O
hid O
her O
face O
on O
her O
arms O
, O
and O
burst O
forth O
into O
hard O
, O
suffocating O
sobs O
. O
| 
  | O
Oh O
, O
earth O
! O
thou O
didst O
seem O
but O
a O
dreary O
dwelling O
- O
place O
for O
thy O
poor O
child O
that O
night O
. O
None O
to O
|
     | O
comfort O
, O
none O
to O
pity O
! O
And O
self O
- O
reproach O
gnawing O
at O
her O
heart O
. O
| 
  | O
Oh O
, O
why O
did O
she O
ever O
listen O
to O
the O
tempter O
? O
Why O
did O
she O
ever O
give O
ear O
to O
her O
own O
suggestions O
, O
|
     | O
and O
cravings O
after O
wealth O
and O
grandeur O
? O
Why O
had O
she O
thought O
it O
a O
fine O
thing O
to O
have O
a O
rich O
|
     | O
lover O
? O
| 
  | O
She O
— O
she O
had O
deserved O
it O
all O
  O
but O
he O
was O
the O
victim,—he O
, O
the O
beloved O
. O
She O
could O
not O
|
     | O
conjecture O
, O
she O
could O
not O
even O
pause O
to O
think O
who O
had O
revealed O
, O
or O
how O
he O
had O
discovered O
her O
|
     | O
acquaintance O
with O
Harry B-PERSON
Carson I-PERSON
. O
It O
was O
but O
too O
clear O
, O
some O
way O
or O
another O
, O
he O
had O
learnt O
all O
  O
|
     | O
and O
what O
would O
he O
think O
of O
her O
? O
No O
hope O
of O
his O
love,—oh B-LOC
, O
that O
she O
would O
give O
up O
, O
and O
be O
|
     | O
content O
  O
it O
was O
his O
life O
, O
his O
precious O
life O
, O
that O
was O
threatened O
. O
Then O
she O
tried O
to O
recall O
the O
|
     | O
particulars O
, O
which O
, O
when O
Mrs. O
Wilson B-PERSON
had O
given O
them O
, O
had O
fallen O
but O
upon O
a O
deafened O
|
     | O
ear,—something O
about O
a O
gun O
, O
a O
quarrel O
, O
which O
she O
could O
not O
remember O
clearly O
. O
Oh O
, O
how O
terrible O
|
     | O
to O
think O
of O
his O
crime O
, O
his O
blood O
- O
guiltiness O
  O
he O
who O
had O
hitherto O
been O
so O
good O
, O
so O
noble O
, O
and O
|
     | O
now O
an O
assassin O
! O
And O
then O
she O
shrank O
from O
him O
in O
thought O
  O
and O
then O
, O
with O
bitter O
remorse O
, O
clung O
|
     | O
more O
closely O
to O
his O
image O
with O
passionate O
self O
- O
upbraiding O
. O
Was O
it O
not O
she O
who O
had O
led O
him O
to O
|
     | O
the O
pit O
into O
which O
he O
had O
fallen O
? O
Was O
she O
to O
blame O
him O
? O
She O
to O
judge O
him O
? O
Who O
could O
tell O
how O
|
     | O
maddened O
he O
might O
have O
been O
by O
jealousy O
  O
how O
one B-CARDINAL
moment O
's O
uncontrollable O
passion O
might O
have O
led O
|
     | O
him O
to O
become O
a O
murderer O
? O
And O
she O
had O
blamed O
him O
in O
her O
heart O
after O
his O
last O
deprecating O
, O
|
     | O
imploring O
, O
prophetic O
speech O
! O
| 
  | O
Then O
she O
burst O
out O
crying O
afresh O
  O
and O
when O
weary O
of O
crying O
, O
fell O
to O
thinking O
again O
. O
The O
|
     | O
gallows O
! O
The O
gallows O
! O
Black O
it O
stood O
against O
the O
burning O
light O
which O
dazzled O
her O
shut O
eyes O
, O

     | O
press O
on O
them O
as O
she O
would O
. O
Oh O
! O
she O
was O
going O
mad O
  O
and O
for O
awhile O
she O
lay O
outwardly O
still O
, O
but O
|
     | O
with O
the O
pulses O
careering O
through O
her O
head O
with O
wild O
vehemence O
. O

  | O
And O
then O
came O
a O
strange O
forgetfulness O
of O
the O
present O
, O
in O
thought O
of O
the O
long O
- O
past O
times —of O
|
     | O
those O
days O
when O
she O
hid O
her O
face O
on O
her O
mother O
's O
pitying O
, O
loving O
bosom O
, O
and O
heard O
tender O
words O

     | O
of O
comfort O
, O
be O
her O
grief O
or O
her O
error O
what O
it O
might —of O
those O
days O
when O
she O
had O
felt O
as O
if O
her O
|
     | O
mother O
's O
love O
was O
too O
mighty O
not O
to O
last O
for O
ever —of O
those B-DATE
days I-DATE
when O
hunger O
had O
been O
to O
her O
|
     | O
( O
as O
to O
the O
little O
stranger O
she O
had O
that O
evening B-TIME
relieved O
) O
something O
to O
be O
thought O
about O
, O
and O
|
     | O
mourned O
over —when O
Jem B-PERSON
and O
she O
had O
played O
together O
  O
he O
, O
with O
the O
condescension O
of O
an O
older O
|
     | O
child O
, O
and O
she O
, O
with O
unconscious O
earnestness O
, O
believing O
that O
he O
was O
as O
much O
gratified O
with O
|
     | O
important O
trifles O
as O
she O
was —when O
her O
father O
was O
a O
cheery O
- O
hearted O
man O
, O
rich O
in O
the O
love O
of O
his O
|
     | O
wife O
, O
and O
the O
companionship O
of O
his O
friend —when B-PERSON
( O
for O
it O
still O
worked O
round O
to O
that O
) O
, O
when O
|
     | O
mother O
was O
alive O
, O
and O
|  | O
he O
|  | O
was O
not O
a O
murderer O
. O
| 
  | O
And O
then O
Heaven O
blessed O
her O
unaware O
, O
and O
she O
sank O
from O
remembering O
, O
to O
wandering O
, O
unconnected O
|
     | O
thought O
, O
and O
thence O
to O
sleep O
. O
Yes O
! O
it O
was O
sleep O
, O
though O
in O
that O
strange O
posture O
, O
on O
that O
hard O
|
     | O
cold O
bed O
  O
and O
she O
dreamt O
of O
the O
happy O
times O
of O
long O
ago O
, O
and O
her O
mother O
came O
to O
her O
, O
and O
kissed O
|
     | O
her O
as O
she O
lay O
, O
and O
once O
more O
the O
dead O
were O
alive O
again O
in O
that O
happy O
world O
of O
dreams O
. O
All O
was O
|
     | O
restored O
to O
the O
gladness O
of O
childhood O
, O
even O
to O
the O
little O
kitten O
which O
had O
been O
her O
playmate O

     | O
and O
bosom O
friend O
then O
, O
and O
which O
had O
been O
long O
forgotten O
in O
her O
waking O
hours O
. O
All O
the O
loved O
|
     | O
ones O
were O
there O
! O
| 
  | O
She O
suddenly O
wakened O
! O
Clear O
and O
wide O
awake O
! O
Some O
noise O
had O
startled O
her O
from O
sleep O
. O
She O
sat O
|
     | O
up O
, O
and O
put O
her O
hair O
( O
still O
wet O
with O
tears O
) O
back O
from O
her O
flushed O
cheeks O
, O
and O
listened O
. O
At O
|
     | O
first O
she O
could O
only O
hear O
her O
beating O
heart O
. O
All O
was O
still O
without O
, O
for O
it O
was O
after O
midnight B-TIME
, O
|
     | O
such O
hours O
of O
agony O
had O
passed O
away O
  O
but O
the O
moon O
shone O
clearly O
in O
at O
the O
unshuttered O
window O
, O
|
     | O
making O
the O
room O
almost O
as O
light O
as O
day O
, O
in O
its O
cold O
ghastly O
radiance O
. O
There O
was O
a O
low O
knock O
at O
|
     | O
the O
door O
! O
A O
strange O
feeling O
crept O
over O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
heart O
, O
as O
if O
something O
spiritual O
were O
near O
  O
as O
if O
|
     | O
the O
dead O
, O
so O
lately O
present O
in O
her O
dreams O
, O
were O
yet O
gliding O
and O
hovering O
round O
her O
, O
with O
their O
|
     | O
dim O
, O
dread O
forms O
. O
And O
yet O
, O
why O
dread O
? O
Had O
they O
not O
loved O
her?—and B-ORG
who O
loved O
her O
now O
? O
Was O
she O
|
     | O
not O
lonely O
enough O
to O
welcome O
the O
spirits O
of O
the O
dead O

who O
had O
loved O
her O

here O

mother O
had O
conscious O

her O
love O

So O
she O
quieted O
her O

Esther B-PERSON
. O

  | O
A O
craving O
desire O
to O
know O
more O
took O
possession O
of O
her O
mind O
. O
Far O
away O
as O
she O
was O
from O
Turner B-ORG
|
     | I-ORG
Street I-ORG
, O
she O
immediately O
set O
off O
to O
the O
scene O
of O
the O
murder O
, O
which O
was O
faintly O
lighted O
by O
the O
|
     | O
gray O
dawn O
as O
she O
reached O
the O
spot O
. O
It O
was O
so O
quiet O
and O
still O
that O
she O
could O
hardly O
believe O
it O
|
     | O
to O
be O
the O
place O
. O
The O
only O
vestige O
of O
any O
scuffle O
or O
violence O
was O
a O
trail O
on O
the O
dust O
, O
as O
if O
|
     | O
somebody O
had O
been O
lying O
there O
, O
and O
then O
been O
raised O
by O
extraneous O
force O
. O
The O
little O
birds O
were O
|
     | O
beginning O
to O
hop O
and O
twitter O
in O
the O
leafless O
hedge O
, O
making O
the O
only O
sound O
that O
was O
near O
and O

     | O
distinct O
. O
She O
crossed O
into O
the O
field O
where O
she O
guessed O
the O
murderer O
to O
have O
stood O
  O
it O
was O
easy O

     | O
of O
access O

for O
the O
worn O

stunted O
hawthorn O

The O
night O
- O
smell O
of O
bruised O

     | O
grass O
came O
up O
from O
under O
her O
feet O
, O
as O
she O
went O
towards O
the O
saw O
- O
pit O
and O
carpenter O

shed O
, O
which O
, O
|
     | O
as O
I O
have O
said O
before O
, O
were O
in O
a O
corner O
of O
the O
field O
near O
the O
road O
, O
and O
where O
one O
of O
her O
|
     | O
informants O
had O
told O
her O
it O
was O
supposed O
by O
the O
police O
that O
the O
murderer O
had O
lurked O
while O
|
     | O
waiting O
for O
his O
victim O
. O
There O
was O
no O
sign O
, O
however O
, O
that O
any O
one O
had O
been O
about O
the O
place O
. O
If O
|
     | O
the O
grass O
had O
been O
bruised O
or O
bent O
where O
he O
had O
trod O
, O
it O
had O
had O
enough O
of O
the O
elasticity O
of O
|
     | O
life O
to O
raise O
itself O
under O
the O
dewy O
influences O
of O
night O
. O
She O
hushed O
her O
breath O
with O
involuntary O
|
     | O
awe O
, O
but O
nothing O
else O
told O
of O
the O
violent O
deed O
by O
which O
a O
fellow O
- O
creature O
had O
passed O
away O
. O
She O
|
     | O
stood O
still O
for O
a B-TIME
minute I-TIME
, O
imagining O
to O
herself O
the O
position O
of O
the O
parties O
, O
guided O
by O
the O
only O
|
     | O
circumstance O
which O
afforded O
any O
evidence O
, O
the O
trailing O
mark O
on O
the O
dust O
in O
the O
road O
. O
| 
  | O
Suddenly O
( O
it O
was O
before O
the O
sun O
had O
risen O
above O
the O
horizon O
) O
she O
became O
aware O
of O
something O
|
     | O
white O
in O
the O
hedge O
. O
All O
other O
colours O
wore O
the O
same O
murky O
hue O
, O
though O
the O
forms O
of O
objects O
were O
|
     | O
perfectly O
distinct O
. O
What O
was O
it O
? O
It O
could O
not O
be O
a O
flower —that O
, O
the B-DATE
time I-DATE
of I-DATE
year I-DATE
made O
clear O
. O
A O
|
     | O
frozen O
lump O
of O
snow O
, O
lingering O
late O
in O
one O
of O
the O
gnarled O
tufts O
of O
the O
hedge O
? O
She O
stepped O
|
     | O
forward O
to O
examine O
. O
It O
proved O
to O
be O
a O
little O
piece O
of O
stiff O
writing O
- O
paper O
compressed O
into O
a O
|
     | O
round O
shape O
. O
She O
understood O
it O
instantly O
  O
it O
was O
the O
paper O
that O
had O
served O
as O
wadding O
for O
the O
|
     | O
murderer O
's O
gun O
. O
Then O
she O
had O
been O
standing O
just O
where O
the O
murderer O
must O
have O
been O
but O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME

     | I-TIME
hours I-TIME
before O
  O
probably O
( O
as O
the O
rumour O
had O
spread O
through O
the O
town O
, O
reaching O
her O
ears O
) O
one B-CARDINAL

with O
black O

     | O
they O
suffered O
  O
and O
besides O
this O
there O
was O
her O
own O
individual O
dislike O
of O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON
, O
and O
dread O
|
     | O
of O
him O
for O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
sake O
. O
Yet O
, O
poor O
Mary B-PERSON
! O
Death O
was O
a O
terrible O
, O
though O
sure O
, O
remedy O
for O
the O
evil O
|
     | O
Esther B-PERSON
had O
dreaded O
for O
her O
  O
and O
how O
would O
she O
stand O
the O
shock O
, O
loving O
as O
her O
aunt O
believed O
her O
|
     | O
to O
do O
? O
Poor O
Mary B-PERSON
! O
who O
would O
comfort O
her O
? O
Esther B-PERSON
's O
thoughts O
began O
to O
picture O
her O
sorrow O
, O
her O
|
     | O
despair O
, O
when O
the O
news O
of O
her O
lover O
's O
death O
should O
reach O
her O
  O
and O
she O
longed O
to O
tell O
her O
there O
|
     | O
might O
have O
been O
a O
keener O
grief O
yet O
had O
he O
lived O
. O
| 
  | O
Bright O
, O
beautiful O
came O
the O
slanting O
rays O
of O
the O
morning B-TIME
sun O
. O
It O
was O
time O
for O
such O
as O
she O
to O
|
     | O
hide O
themselves O
, O
with O
the O
other O
obscene O
things O
of O
night B-TIME
, O
from O
the O
glorious O
light O
of O
day O
, O
which O
|
     | O
was O
only O
for O
the O
happy O
. O
So O
she O
turned O
her O
steps O
towards O
town O
, O
still O
holding O
the O
paper O
. O
But O
in O
|
     | O
getting O
over O
the O
hedge O
it O
encumbered O
her O
to O
hold O
it O
in O
her O
clasped O
hand O
, O
and O
she O
threw O
it O
down O
. O
|
     | O
She O
passed O
on O
a O
few O
steps O
, O
her O
thoughts O
still O
of O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
till O
the O
idea O
crossed O
her O
mind O
, O
could O
it O
|
     | O
( O
blank O
as O
it O
appeared O
to O
be O
) O
give O
any O
clue O
to O
the O
murderer O
? O
As O
I O
said O
before O
, O
her O
sympathies O
|
     | O
were O
all O
on O
that O
side O
, O
so O
she O
turned O
back O
and O
picked O
it O
up O
  O
and O
then O
feeling O
as O
if O
in O
some O
|
     | O
measure O
an O
accessory O
, O
she O
hid O
it O
unexamined O
in O
her O
hand O
, O
and O
hastily O
passed O
out O
of O
the O
street O
|
     | O
at O
the O
opposite O
end O
to O
that O
by O
which O
she O
had O
entered O
it O
. O
| 
  | O
And O
what O
do O
you O
think O
she O
felt O
, O
when O
, O
having O
walked O
some O
distance O
from O
the O
spot O
, O
she O
dared O
to O
|
     | O
open O
the O
crushed O
paper O
, O
and O
saw O
written O
on O
it O
Mary B-PERSON
Barton I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
name O
, O
and O
not O
only O
that O
, O
but O
the O
|
     | O
street O
in O
which O
she O
lived O
! O
True O
, O
a O
letter O
or O
two B-CARDINAL
was O
torn O
off O
, O
but O
, O
nevertheless O
, O
there O
was O
the O
|
     | O
name O
clear O
to O
be O
recognised O
. O
And O
oh O
! O
what O
terrible O
thought O
flashed O
into O
her O
mind O
  O
or O
was O
it O
|
     | O
only O
fancy O
? O
But O
it O
looked O
very O
like O
the O
writing O
which O
she O
had O
once O
known O
well O
— O
the O
writing O
of O
|
     | O
Jem B-PERSON
Wilson I-PERSON
, O
who O
, O
when O
she O
lived O
at O
her O
brother O
- O
in O
- O
law O
's O
, O
and O
he O
was O
a O
near O
neighbour O
, O
had O
often O
|
     | O
been O
employed O
by O
her O
to O
write O
her O
letters O
to O
people O
, O
to O
whom O
she O
was O
ashamed O
of O
sending O
her O
own O
|
     | O
misspelt O
scrawl O
. O
She O
remembered O
the O
wonderful O
flourishes O
she O
had O
so O
much O
admired O
in O
those B-DATE
days I-DATE
, O
|
     | O
while O
she O
sat O
by O
dictating O
, O
and O
Jem B-PERSON
, O
in O
all O
the O
pride O
of O
newly O
- O
acquired O
penmanship O
, O
used O
to O
|
     | O
dazzle O
her O
eyes O
by O
extraordinary O
graces O
and O
twirls O
. O
| 
  | O
If O
it O
were O
his O
! O
| 
  | O
Oh O
! O
perhaps O
it O
was O
merely O
that O
her O
head O
was O
running O
so O
on O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
that O
she O
was O
associating O
|
     | O
every O
trifle O
with O
her O
. O
As O
if O
only O
one O
person O
wrote O
in O
that O
flourishing O
, O
meandering O
style O
! O
| 
  | O
It O
was O
enough O
to O
fill O
her O
mind O
to O
think O
from O
what O
she O
might O
have O
saved O
Mary B-PERSON
by O
securing O
the O
|
     | O
paper O
. O
She O
would O
look O
at O
it O
just O
once O
more O
, O
and O
see O
if O
some O
very O
dense O
and O
stupid O
policeman O
|
     | O
could O
have O
mistaken O
the O
name O
, O
or O
if O
Mary B-PERSON
would O
certainly O
have O
been O
dragged O
into O
notice O
in O
the O
|
     | O
affair O
. O
| 
  | O
No O
! O
no O
one O
could O
have O
mistaken O
the O
" O
ry O
Barton B-PERSON
, O
" O
and O
it O
|  | O
was O
|  | O
Jem B-PERSON
's O
handwriting O
! O
| 
  | O
Oh O
! O
if O
it O
was O
so O
, O
she O
understood O
it O
all O
, O
and O
she O
had O
been O
the O
cause O
! O
With O
her O
violent O
and O
|
     | O
unregulated O
nature O
, O
rendered O
morbid O
by O
the O
course O
of O
life O
she O
led O
, O
and O
her O
consciousness O
of O
her O
|
     | O
degradation O
, O
she O
cursed O
herself O
for O
the O
interference O
which O
she O
believed O
had O
led O
to O
this O
  O
for O
|
     | O
the O
information O
and O
the O
warning O
she O
had O
given O
to O
Jem B-PERSON
, O
which O
had O
roused O
him O
to O
this O
murderous O
|
     | O
action O
. O
How O
could O
she O
, O
the O
abandoned O
and O
polluted O
outcast O
, O
ever O
have O
dared O
to O
hope O
for O
a O
|
     | O
blessing O
, O
even O
on O
her O
efforts O
to O
do O
good O
? O
The O
black O
curse O
of O
Heaven O
rested O
on O
all O
her O
doings O
, O
|
     | O
were O
they O
for O
good O
or O
for O
evil O
. O
| 
  | O
Poor O
, O
diseased O
mind O
! O
and O
there O
were O
none O
to O
minister O
to O
thee O
! O
| 
  | O
So O
she O
wandered O
about O
, O
too O
restless O
to O
take O
her O
usual O
heavy O
morning B-TIME
's O
sleep O
, O
up O
and O
down O
the O
|
     | O
streets O
, O
greedily O
listening O
to O
every O
word O
of O
the O
passers O
by O
, O
and O
loitering O
near O
each O
group O
of O
|
     | O
talkers O
, O
anxious O
to O
scrape O
together O
every O
morsel O
of O
information O
, O
or O
conjecture O
, O
or O
suspicion O
, O
|
     | O
though O
without O
possessing O
any O
definite O
purpose O
in O
all O
this O
. O
And O
ever O
and O
always O
she O
clenched O
|
     | O
the O
scrap O
of O
paper O
which O
might O
betray O
so O
much O
, O
until O
her O
nails O
had O
deeply O
indented O
the O
palm O
of O
|
     | O
her O
hand O
  O
so O
fearful O
was O
she O
in O
her O
nervous O
dread O
, O
lest O
unawares O
she O
should O
let O
it O
drop O
. O
| 
  | O
Towards O
the B-DATE
middle I-DATE
of I-DATE
the I-DATE
day I-DATE
she O
could O
no O
longer O
evade O
the O
body O
's O
craving O
want O
of O
rest O
and O
|
     | O
refreshment O
  O
but O
the O
rest O
was O
taken O
in O
a O
spirit O
vault O
, O
and O
the O
refreshment O
was O
a O
glass O
of O
|
     | O
gin O
. O
| 
  | O
Then O
she O
started O
up O
from O
the O
stupor O
she O
had O
taken O
for O
repose O
  O
and O
suddenly O
driven O
before O
the O
|
     | O
gusty O
impulses O
of O
her O
mind O
, O
she O
pushed O
her O
way O
to O
the O
place O
where O
at O
that O
very O
time O
the O
police O
|
     | O
were O
bringing O
the O
information O
they O
had O
gathered O
with O
regard O
to O
the O
all O
- O
engrossing O
murder O
. O
She O
|
     | O
listened O
with O
painful O
acuteness O
of O
comprehension O
to O
dropped O
words O
and O
unconnected O
sentences O
, O
|
     | O
the O
meaning O
of O
which O
became O
clearer O
, O
and O
yet O
more O
clear O
to O
her O
. O
Jem B-PERSON
was O
suspected O
. O
Jem B-PERSON
was O
|
     | O
ascertained O
to O
be O
the O
murderer O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
saw O
him O
( O
although O
he O
, O
absorbed O
in O
deep O
sad O
thought O
, O
saw O
her O
not O
) O
, O
she O
saw O
him O
brought O
|
     | O
hand O
- O
cuffed O
and O
guarded O
out O
of O
the O
coach O
. O
She O
saw O
him O
enter O
the O
station,—she O
gasped O
for O
breath O
|
     | O
till O
he O
came O
out O
, O
still O
hand O
- O
cuffed O
, O
and O
still O
guarded O
, O
to O
be O
conveyed O
to O
the O
New B-GPE
Bailey I-GPE
. O
| 
  | O
He O
was O
the O
only O
one O
who O
had O
spoken O
to O
her O
with O
hope O
, O
that O
she O
might O
yet O
win O
her O
way O
back O
to O
|
     | O
virtue O
. O
His O
words O
had O
lingered O
in O
her O
heart O
with O
a O
sort O
of O
call O
to O
Heaven O
, O
like O
distant O
Sabbath B-PERSON
|
     | O
bells O
, O
although O
in O
her O
despair O
she O
had O
turned O
away O
from O
his O
voice O
. O
He O
was O
the O
only O
one O
who O
had O
|
     | O
spoken O
to O
her O
kindly O
. O
The O
murder O
, O
shocking O
though O
it O
was O
, O
was O
an O
absent O
, O
abstract O
thing O
, O
on O
|
     | O
which O
her O
thoughts O
could O
not O
, O
and O
would O
not O
dwell O
  O
all O
that O
was O
present O
in O
her O
mind O
was O
Jem B-PERSON
's O
|
     | O
danger O
, O
and O
his O
kindness O
. O
| 
  | O
Then O
Mary B-PERSON
came O
to O
remembrance O
. O
Esther O
wondered O
till O
she O
was O
sick O
of O
wondering O
, O
in O
what O
way O
|
     | O
she O
was O
taking O
the O
affair O
. O
In O
some O
manner O
it O
would O
be O
a O
terrible O
blow O
for O
the O
poor O
, O
motherless O
|
     | O
girl O
  O
with O
her O
dreadful O
father O
, O
too O
, O
who O
was O
to O
Esther B-PERSON
a O
sort O
of O
accusing O
angel O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
set O
off O
towards O
the O
court O
where O
Mary B-PERSON
lived O
, O
to O
pick O
up O
what O
she O
could O
there O
of O
|
     | O
information O
. O
But O
she O
was O
ashamed O
to O
enter O
in O
where O
once O
she O
had O
been O
innocent O
, O
and O
hung O
about O
|
     | O
the O
neighbouring O
streets O
, O
not O
daring O
to O
question O
, O
so O
she O
learnt O
but O
little O
  O
nothing O
in O
fact O
but O
|
     | O
the O
knowledge O
of O
John B-PERSON
Barton I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
absence O
from O
home O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
went O
up O
a O
dark O
entry O
to O
rest O
her O
weary O
limbs O
on O
a O
door O
- O
step O
and O
think O
. O
Her O
elbows O
on O
her O
|
     | O
knees O
, O
her O
face O
hidden O
in O
her O
hands O
, O
she O
tried O
to O
gather O
together O
and O
arrange O
her O
thoughts O
. O
But O
|
     | O
still O
every O
now O
and O
then O
she O
opened O
her O
hand O
to O
see O
if O
the O
paper O
were O
yet O
there O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
got O
up O
at O
last O
. O
She O
had O
formed O
a O
plan O
, O
and O
had O
a O
course O
of O
action O
to O
look O
forward O
to O
that O
|
     | O
would O
satisfy O
one O
craving O
desire O
at O
least O
. O
The O
time O
was O
long O
gone O
by O
when O
there O
was O
much O
wisdom O
|
     | O
or O
consistency O
in O
her O
projects O
. O
| 
  | O
It O
was O
getting O
late O
, O
and O
that O
was O
so O
much O
the O
better O
. O
She O
went O
to O
a O
pawn O
- O
shop O
, O
and O
took O
off O
|
     | O
her O
finery O
in O
a O
back O
room O
. O
She O
was O
known O
by O
the O
people O
, O
and O
had O
a O
character O
for O
honesty O
, O
so O
she O
|
     | O
had O
no O
very O
great O
difficulty O
in O
inducing O
them O
to O
let O
her O
have O
a O
suit O
of O
outer O
clothes O
, O
|
     | O
befitting O
the O
wife O
of O
a O
working O
- O
man O
, O
a O
black O
silk O
bonnet O
, O
a O
printed O
gown O
, O
a O
plaid O
shawl O
, O
dirty O
|
     | O
and O
rather O
worn O
to O
be O
sure O
, O
but O
which O
had O
a O
sort O
of O
sanctity O
to O
the O
eyes O
of O
the O
street O
- O
walker O
|
     | O
as O
being O
the O
appropriate O
garb O
of O
that O
happy O
class O
to O
which O
she O
could O
never O
, O
never O
more O
|
     | O
belong O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
looked O
at O
herself O
in O
the O
little O
glass O
which O
hung O
against O
the O
wall O
, O
and O
sadly O
shaking O
her O
|
     | O
head O
, O
thought O
how O
easy O
were O
the O
duties O
of O
that O
Eden B-LOC
of O
innocence O
from O
which O
she O
was O
shut O
out O
  O
|
     | O
how O
she O
would O
work O
, O
and O
toil O
, O
and O
starve O
, O
and O
die O
, O
if O
necessary O
, O
for O
a O
husband O
, O
a O
home,—for O
|
     | O
children,—but O
that O
thought O
she O
could O
not O
bear O
  O
a O
little O
form O
rose O
up O
, O
stern O
in O
its O
innocence O
, O
|
     | O
from O
the O
witches O
' O
cauldron O
of O
her O
imagination O
, O
and O
she O
rushed O
into O
action O
again O
. O
| 
  | O
You O
know O
now O
how O
she O
came O
to O
stand O
by O
the O
threshold O
of O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
door O
, O
waiting O
, O
trembling O
, O
until O
|
     | O
the O
latch O
was O
lifted O
, O
and O
her O
niece O
, O
with O
words O
that O
spoke O
of O
such O
desolation O
among O
the O
living O
, O
|
     | O
fell O
into O
her O
arms O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
had O
felt O
as O
if O
some O
holy O
spell O
would O
prevent O
her O
( O
even O
as O
the O
unholy O
Lady B-PERSON
Geraldine I-PERSON
was O
|
     | O
prevented O
, O
in O
the O
abode O
of O
Christabel B-ORG
) O
from O
crossing O
the O
threshold O
of O
that O
home O
of O
her O
early O
|
     | O
innocence O
  O
and O
she O
had O
meant O
to O
wait O
for O
an O
invitation O
. O
But O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
helpless O
action O
did O
away O
|
     | O
with O
all O
reluctant O
feeling O
, O
and O
she O
bore O
or O
dragged O
her O
to O
a O
seat O
, O
and O
looked O
on O
her O
bewildered O
|
     | O
eyes O
, O
as O
, O
puzzled O
with O
the O
likeness O
, O
which O
was O
not O
identity O
, O
she O
gazed O
on O
her O
aunt O
's O
|
     | O
features O
. O
| 
  | O
In O
pursuance O
of O
her O
plan O
, O
Esther B-PERSON
meant O
to O
assume O
the O
manners O
and O
character O
, O
as O
she O
had O
done O
|
     | O
the O
dress O
, O
of O
a O
mechanic O
's O
wife O
  O
but O
then O
, O
to O
account O
for O
her O
long O
absence O
, O
and O
her O
long O
|
     | O
silence O
towards O
all O
that O
ought O
to O
have O
been O
dear O
to O
her O
, O
it O
was O
necessary O
that O
she O
should O
put O
|
     | O
on O
an O
indifference O
far O
distant O
from O
her O
heart O
, O
which O
was O
loving O
and O
yearning O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
all O
|
     | O
its O
faults O
. O
And O
, O
perhaps O
, O
she O
overacted O
her O
part O
, O
for O
certainly O
Mary B-PERSON
felt O
a O
kind O
of O
repugnance O
|
     | O
to O
the O
changed O
and O
altered O
aunt O
, O
who O
so O
suddenly O
re O
- O
appeared O
on O
the O
scene O
  O
and O
it O
would O
have O
|
     | O
cut O
Esther B-PERSON
to O
the O
very O
core O
, O
could O
she O
have O
known O
how O
her O
little O
darling O
of O
former O
days O
was O
|
     | O
feeling O
towards O
her O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
You O
do O
n't O
remember O
me O
I O
see O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
! O
" O
she O
began O
. O
" O
It O
's O
a O
long O
while O
since O
I O
left O
you O
all O
, O
to O
|
     | O
be O
sure O
  O
and O
I O
, O
many O
a O
time O
, O
thought O
of O
coming O
to O
see O
you O
, O
and O
— O
and O
your O
father O
. O
But O
I O
live O
so O
|
     | O
far O
off O
, O
and O
am O
always O
so O
busy O
, O
I O
can O
not O
do O
just O
what O
I O
wish O
. O
You O
recollect O
aunt O
Esther B-PERSON
, O
do O
n't O
|
     | O
you O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Are O
you O
aunt O
Hetty B-PERSON
? O
" O
asked O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
faintly O
, O
still O
looking O
at O
the O
face O
which O
was O
so O
different O
|
     | O
from O
the O
old O
recollections O
of O
her O
aunt O
's O
fresh O
dazzling O
beauty O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Yes O
! O
I O
am O
aunt O
Hetty B-PERSON
. O
Oh O
! O
it O
's O
so O
long O
since O
I O
heard O
that O
name O
, O
" O
sighing O
forth O
the O
thoughts O
|
     | O
it O
suggested O
  O
then O
recovering O
herself O
, O
and O
striving O
after O
the O
hard O
character O
she O
wished O
to O
|
     | O
assume O
, O
she O
continued O
: O
" O
And O
to O
- O
day O
I O
heard O
a O
friend O
of O
yours O
, O
and O
of O
mine O
too O
, O
long O
ago O
, O
was O
in O
|
     | O
trouble O
, O
and O
I O
guessed O
you O
would O
be O
in O
sorrow O
, O
so O
I O
thought O
I O
would O
just O
step O
this O
far O
and O
see O
|
     | O
you O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
tears O
flowed O
afresh O
, O
but O
she O
had O
no O
desire O
to O
open O
her O
heart O
to O
her O
strangely O
- O
found O
|
     | O
aunt O
, O
who O
had O
, O
by O
her O
own O
confession O
, O
kept O
aloof O
from O
and O
neglected O
them O
for O
so B-DATE
many I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O
Yet O
|
     | O
she O
tried O
to O
feel O
grateful O
for O
kindness O
( O
however O
late O
) O
from O
any O
one O
, O
and O
wished O
to O
be O
civil O
. O
|
     | O
Moreover O
, O
she O
had O
a O
strong O
disinclination O
to O
speak O
on O
the O
terrible O
subject O
uppermost O
in O
her O
|
     | O
mind O
. O
So O
, O
after O
a O
pause O
she O
said O
, O
| 
  | O
" O
Thank O
you O
. O
I O
dare O
say O
you O
mean O
very O
kind O
. O
Have O
you O
had O
a O
long O
walk O
? O
I O
'm O
so O
sorry O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
|
     | O
rising O
, O
with O
a O
sudden O
thought O
, O
which O
was O
as O
suddenly O
checked O
by O
recollection O
, O
" O
but O
I O
've O
nothing O
|
     | O
to O
eat O
in O
the O
house O
, O
and O
I O
'm O
sure O
you O
must O
be O
hungry O
, O
after O
your O
walk O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
For O
Mary B-PERSON
concluded O
that O
certainly O
her O
aunt O
's O
residence O
must O
be O
far O
away O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
|
     | O
the O
town O
, O
out O
of O
sight O
or O
hearing O
. O
But O
, O
after O
all O
, O
she O
did O
not O
think O
much O
about O
her O
  O
her O
heart O
|
     | O
was O
so O
aching O
- O
full O
of O
other O
things O
, O
that O
all O
besides O
seemed O
like O
a O
dream O
. O
She O
received O
feelings O
|
     | O
and O
impressions O
from O
her O
conversation O
with O
her O
aunt O
, O
but O
did O
not O
, O
could O
not O
, O
put O
them O
together O
, O
|
     | O
or O
think O
or O
argue O
about O
them O
. O
| 
  | O
And O
Esther B-PERSON
! O
How O
scanty O
had O
been O
her O
food O
for O
days B-DATE
and O
weeks B-DATE
, O
her O
thinly O
- O
covered O
bones O
and O
|
     | O
pale O
lips O
might O
tell O
, O
but O
her O
words O
should O
never O
reveal O
! O
So O
, O
with O
a O
little O
unreal O
laugh O
, O
she O
|
     | O
replied O
, O
| 
  | O
" O
Oh O
! O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
my O
dear O
! O
do O
n't O
talk O
about O
eating O
. O
We O
've O
the O
best O
of O
every O
thing O
, O
and O
plenty O
of O
it O
, O
|
     | O
for O
my O
husband O
is O
in O
good O
work O
. O
I O
'd O
such O
a O
supper O
before O
I O
came O
out O
. O
I O
could O
n't O
touch O
a O
morsel O
|
     | O
if O
you O
had O
it O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Her O
words O
shot O
a O
strange O
pang O
through O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
heart O
. O
She O
had O
always O
remembered O
her O
aunt O
's O
|
     | O
loving O
and O
unselfish O
disposition O
  O
how O
was O
it O
changed O
, O
if O
, O
living O
in O
plenty O
, O
she O
had O
never O
|
     | O
thought O
it O
worth O
while O
to O
ask O
after O
her O
relations O
, O
who O
were O
all O
but O
starving O
! O
She O
shut O
up O
her O
|
     | O
heart O
instinctively O
against O
her O
aunt O
. O
| 
  | O
And O
all O
the O
time O
poor O
Esther B-PERSON
was O
swallowing O
her O
sobs O
, O
and O
over O
- O
acting O
her O
part O
, O
and O
|
     | O
controlling O
herself O
more O
than O
she O
had O
done O
for O
many B-DATE
a I-DATE
long I-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
in O
order O
that O
her O
niece O
might O

     | O
not O
be O
shocked O
and O
revolted O
, O
by O
the O
knowledge O
of O
what O
her O
aunt O
had O
become:—a O
prostitute O
  O
an O
|
     | O
outcast O
. O
| 
  | O
For O
she O
longed O
to O
open O
her O
wretched O
, O
wretched O
heart O
, O
so O
hopeless O
, O
so O
abandoned O
by O
all O
living O
|
     | O
things O
, O
to O
one O
who O
had O
loved O
her O
once O
  O
and O
yet O
she O
refrained O
, O
from O
dread O
of O
the O
averted O
eye O
, O
|
     | O
the O
altered O
voice O
, O
the O
internal O
loathing O
, O
which O
she O
feared O
such O
disclosure O
might O
create O
. O
She O
|
     | O
would O
go O
straight O
to O
the O
subject O
of O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
. O
She O
could O
not O
tarry O
long O
, O
for O
she O
felt O
unable O
to O

     | O
support O
the O
character O
she O
had O
assumed O
for O
any O
length O
of O
time O
. O
| 
  | O
They O
sat O
by O
the O
little O
round O
table O
, O
facing O
each O
other O
. O
The O
candle O
was O
placed O
right O
between O

     | O
them O
, O
and O
Esther B-PERSON
moved O
it O
in O
order O
to O
have O
a O
clearer O
view O
of O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
face O
, O
so O
that O
she O
might O
|
     | O
read O
her O
emotions O
, O
and O
ascertain O
her O
interests O
. O
Then O
she O
began O
: O
| 
  | O
" O
It O
's O
a O
bad O
business O
, O
I O
'm O
afraid O

this O
of O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON

murder O

" O

  | O
Mary B-PERSON
winced O
a O
little O
. O

" O
I O
hear O
Jem B-PERSON
Wilson I-PERSON
is O
taken O
up O
for O

" O
| 
  | O
Mary B-PERSON
covered O
her O
eyes O
with O
her O
hands O
, O
as O
if O
to O
shade O
them O
from O
the O
light O
, O

Esther B-PERSON
herself O
, O

     | O
less O
accustomed O
to O
self O

command O
, O
was O
getting O
too O
much O
agitated O
for O
calm O
observation O
of O

     | O
another O

" O
I O
was O

a O

continued O
Esther B-PERSON

" O

, O

     | O
as O
luck O

have O
it O

of O
paper O
in O
the O
hedge O
, O
" O
producing O
the O
precious O
piece O
|
     | O
still O
folded O
in O
her O
hand O
. O
" O
It O
has O
been O
used O
as O
wadding O
for O
the O
gun O
, O
I O
reckon O
  O
indeed O
, O
that O
's O
|
     | O
clear O
enough O
, O
from O
the O
shape O
it O
's O
crammed O
into O
. O
I O
was O
sorry O
for O
the O
murderer O
, O
whoever O
he O
might O
|
     | O
be O
( O
I O
did O
n't O
then O
know O
of O
Jem B-PERSON
's O
being O
suspected O
) O
, O
and O
I O
thought O
I O
would O
never O
leave O
a O
thing O

     | O
about O
as O
might O
help O
, O
if O
ever O
so O
little O
, O
to O
convict O
him O
  O
the O
police O
are O
so O
' O
cute O
about O
straws O
. O
|
     | O
So O
I O
carried O
it O
a O
little O
way O
, O
and O
then O
I O
opened O
it O
and O
saw O
your O
name O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Mary B-PERSON
took O
her O
hands O
away O
from O
her O
eyes O
, O
and O
looked O
with O
surprise O
at O
her O
aunt O
's O
face O
, O
as O
she O
|
     | O
uttered O
these O
words O
. O
She O
|  | O
was O
|  | O
kind O
after O
all O
, O
for O
was O
she O
not O
saving O
her O
from O
being O
|
     | O
summoned O
, O
and O
from O
being O
questioned O
and O
examined O
  O
a O
thing O
to O
be O
dreaded O
above O
all O
others O
: O
as O
|
     | O
she O
felt O
sure O
that O
her O
unwilling O
answers O
, O
frame O
them O
how O
she O
might O
, O
would O
add O
to O
the O
suspicions O
|
     | O
against O
Jem B-PERSON
  O
her O
aunt O
was O
indeed O
kind O
, O
to O
think O
of O
what O
would O
spare O
her O
this O
. O
| 
  | O
Esther O
went O
on O
, O
without O
noticing O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
look O
. O
The O
very O
action O
of O
speaking O
was O
so O
painful O
to O
|
     | O
her O
, O
and O
so O
much O
interrupted O
by O
the O
hard O
, O
raking O
little O
cough O
, O
which O
had O
been O
her O
constant O
|
     | O
annoyance O
for O
months B-DATE
, O
that O
she O
was O
too O
much O
engrossed O
by O
the O
physical O
difficulty O
of O
utterance O
, O
|
     | O
to O
be O
a O
very O
close O
observer O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
There O
could O
be O
no O
mistake O
if O
they O
had O
found O
it O
. O
Look O
at O
your O
name O
, O
together O
with O
the O
very O
|
     | O
name O
of O
this O
court O
! O
And O
in O
Jem B-PERSON
's O
hand O
- O
writing O
too O
, O
or O
I O
'm O
much O
mistaken O
. O
Look O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
! O
" O
| 
  | O
And O
now O
she O
did O
watch O
her O
. O
| 
  | O
Mary B-PERSON
took O
the O
paper O
and O
flattened O
it O
  O
then O
suddenly O
stood O
stiff O
up O
, O
with O
irrepressible O
|
     | O
movement O
, O
as O
if O
petrified O
by O
some O
horror O
abruptly O
disclosed O
  O
her O
face O
, O
strung O
and O
rigid O
  O
her O
|
     | O
lips O
compressed O
tight O
, O
to O
keep O
down O
some O
rising O
exclamation O
. O
She O
dropped O
on O
her O
seat O
, O
as O
|
     | O
suddenly O
as O
if O
the O
braced O
muscles O
had O
in O
an O
instant O
given O
way O
. O
But O
she O
spoke O
no O
word O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
It O
is O
his O
hand O
- O
writing O
— O
isn't O
it O
? O
" O
asked O
Esther B-PERSON
, O
though O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
manner O
was O
almost O
confirmation O
|
     | O
enough O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
You O
will O
not O
tell O
. O
You O
never O
will O
tell O
, O
" O
demanded O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
tone O
so O
sternly O
earnest O
, O
as O
|
     | O
almost O
to O
be O
threatening O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Nay O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
Esther B-PERSON
, O
rather O
reproachfully O
, O
" O
I O
am O
not O
so O
bad O
as O
that O
. O
Oh O
! O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
you O
|
     | O
can O
not O
think O
I O
would O
do O
that O
, O
whatever O
I O
may O
be O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
The O
tears O
sprang O
to O
her O
eyes O
at O
the O
idea O
that O
she O
was O
suspected O
of O
being O
one O
who O
would O
help O
|
     | O
to O
inform O
against O
an O
old O
friend O
. O
| 
  | O
Mary B-PERSON
caught O
her O
sad O
and O
upbraiding O
look O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
No O
! O
I O
know O
you O
would O
not O
tell O
, O
aunt O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
I O
say O
, O
I O
am O
so O
shocked O
. O
But O
say O
you O
|
     | O
will O
not O
tell O
. O
Do O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
No O
, O
indeed O
I O
will O
not O
tell O
, O
come O
what O
may O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Mary B-PERSON
sat O
still O
, O
looking O
at O
the O
writing O
, O
and O
turning O
the O
paper O
round O
with O
careful O
examination O
, O
|
     | O
trying O
to O
hope O
, O
but O
her O
very O
fears O
belying O
her O
hopes O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
thought O
you O
cared O
for O
the O
young O
man O
that O
's O
murdered O
, O
" O
observed O
Esther B-PERSON
, O
half B-CARDINAL
aloud O
  O
but O
|
     | O
feeling O
that O
she O
could O
not O
mistake O
this O
strange O
interest O
in O
the O
suspected O
murderer O
, O
implied O
by O
|
     | O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
eagerness O
to O
screen O
him O
from O
any O
thing O
which O
might O
strengthen O
suspicion O
against O
him O
. O
She O
|
     | O
had O
come O
, O
desirous O
to O
know O
the O
extent O
of O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
grief O
for O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON
, O
and O
glad O
of O
the O
excuse O
|
     | O
afforded O
her O
by O
the O
important O
scrap O
of O
paper O

Her O
remark O
about O
its O
being O
Jem B-PERSON
's O
hand O
- O
writing O
, O
|
     | O
she O
had O
, O
with O
this O
view O
of O
ascertaining O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
state O
of O
feeling O
, O
felt O
to O
be O
most O
imprudent O
the O
|
     | O
instant O
after O
she O
uttered O
it O
  O
but O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
anxiety O
that O
she O
should O
not O
tell O
was O
too O
great O
, O
and O
|
     | O
too O
decided O
, O
to O
leave O
a O
doubt O
as O
to O
her O
interest O
for O
Jem B-PERSON
. O
She O
grew O
more O
and O
more O
bewildered O
, O
|
     | O
and O
her O
dizzy O
head O
refused O
to O
reason O
. O
Mary B-PERSON
never O
spoke O
. O
She O
held O
the O
bit O
of O
paper O
firmly O
, O

     | O
determined O
to O
retain O
possession O

it O
, O
come O
what O
might O

anxious O
, O

impatient O
, O
for O
her O

     | O
aunt O

go O

As O
she O
sat O
, O
her O
face O
bore O
a O
likeness O
to O
Esther B-PERSON
's O
dead O
child O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
You O
are O
so O
like O
my O
little O
girl O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
! O
" O
said O
Esther B-PERSON
, O
weary O
of O
the O
one B-CARDINAL
subject O
on O
which O
she O
|
     | O
could O
get O
no O
satisfaction O
, O
and O
recurring O
, O
with O
full O
heart O
, O
to O
the O
thought O
of O
the O
dead O
. O
| 
  | O
Mary B-PERSON
looked O
up O
. O
Her O
aunt O
had O
children O
, O
then O
. O
That O
was O
all O
the O
idea O
she O
received O
. O
No O
faint O
|
     | O
imagination O
of O
the O
love O
and O
the O
woe O
of O
that O
poor O
creature O
crossed O
her O
mind O
, O
or O
she O
would O
have O

     | O
taken O
her O
, O
all O
guilty O
and O
erring O
, O
to O
her O
bosom O
, O
and O
tried O
to O
bind O
up O
the O
broken O
heart O
. O
No O
! O
it O
|
     | O
was O
not O
to O
be O

Her O
aunt O
had O
children O
, O
then O
  O
and O
she O
was O
on O
the O
point O
of O
putting O
some O
question O
|
     | O
about O
them O
, O
but O
before O
it O
could O
be O
spoken O
another O
thought O
turned O
it O
aside O
, O
and O
she O
went O
back O
to O
|
     | O
her O
task O
of O
unravelling O
the O
mystery O
of O
the O
paper O
, O
and O
the O
hand O
- O
writing O
. O
Oh O
! O
how O
she O
wished O
her O

     | O
aunt O
would O
go O
. O

  | O
As O
if O
, O
according O
to O
the O
believers O
in O
mesmerism O
, O
the O
intenseness O
of O
her O
wish O
gave O
her O
power O

     | O
over O
another O
, O
although O
the O
wish O
was O
unexpressed O
, O
Esther B-PERSON
felt O
herself O
unwelcome O
, O
and O
that O
her O
|
     | O
absence O
was O
desired O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
felt O
this O
some O
time O
before O
she O
could O
summon O
up O
resolution O
to O
go O
. O
She O
was O
so O
much O

     | O
disappointed O
in O
this O
longed O
- O
for O
, O
dreaded O
interview O
with O
Mary B-PERSON

had O
wished O

impose O
upon O
her O

     | O
with O
her O
tale O
of O
married O
respectability O
, O
and O
yet O
she O
had O
yearned O
and O
craved O
for O
sympathy O
in O
her O
|
     | O
real O
lot O
. O
And O
she O
had O
imposed O
upon O
her O
well O
. O
She O
should O
perhaps O
be O
glad O
of O
it O
afterwards O
  O
but O
|
     | O
her O
desolation O
of O
hope O
seemed O
for O
the O
time O
redoubled O
. O
And O
she O
must O
leave O
the O
old O
|
     | O
dwelling O
- O
place O
, O
whose O
very O
walls O
, O
and O
flags O
, O
dingy O
and O
sordid O
as O
they O
were O
, O
had O
a O
charm O
for O

     | O
her O
. O
Must O
leave O
the O
abode O
of O
poverty O

for O
the O
more O
terrible O
abodes O
of O
vice O

She O
must O

go O

" O
Well O

good O

night O

That O
bit O
of O

enough O

you O

catching O
at O

some O
glimmering O

" O

certainly O
meant O

act O

     | O
kindly O
in O

her O
the O
paper O
( O

piece O

and O
thus O
saving O
her O

     | O
from O
— O
she O
could O
not O
rightly O
think O
how O
much O

how O
little O

desirous O

     | O
up O
for O

she O
advanced O

departure O

But O
, O
to O
her O
surprise O
, O
her O
aunt O
pushed O
her O
off O
with O
a O
frantic O
kind O
of O
gesture O
, O
and O
saying O
the O

words O

" O
Not O
me O

You O
must O
never O

You O
! O
" O

  | O
She O
rushed O
into O
the O
outer O
darkness O

the O
street O

there O
wept O
long O

on O

Then O
she O
sat O
down O
for O
an O
instant O
to O
think O
  O
and O

     | O
rising O
directly O

went O

with O
a O
step O

up O

I O
must O
tell O

I O
must O
put O

the O
dreadful O
secret O

she O

valentine O
sent O

Jem B-PERSON

in O
those B-DATE

when O
she O

     | O
did O
not O
treasure O
and O
hoard O
up O
every O
thing O
he O
had O
touched O
, O
as O
she O
would O
do O
now O

| 
  | O
That O
copy O
had O
been O
given O
to O
her O
father O
, O
for O
whom O
it O
was O
made O

she O

occasionally O
seen O

     | O
him O
reading O
it O
over O
, O
not O
a O
fortnight O
ago O
she O
was O
sure O

But O
she O
resolved O
to O
ascertain O
if O
the O

     | O
other O
part O
still O
remained O
in O
his O
possession O
. O
He O
might O
, O
it O
was O
just O
possible O
he O
|  | O
might O
| | O
, O
|
     | O
have O
given O
it O
away O
to O
some O
friend O
  O
and O
if O
so O
, O
that O
person O
was O
the O
guilty O
one O
, O
for O
she O
could O

     | O
swear O
to O
the O
paper O
anywhere O
. O
| 
  | O
First B-ORDINAL
of O
all O
she O
pulled O
out O
every O
article O
from O
the O
little O
old O
chest O
of O
drawers O
. O
Amongst O
them O
|
     | O
were O
some O
things O
which O
had O
belonged O
to O
her O
mother O
, O
but O
she O
had O
no O
time O
now O
to O
examine O
and O
try O
|
     | O
and O
remember O
them O
. O
All O
the O
reverence O
she O
could O
pay O
them O
was O
to O
carry O
them O
and O
lay O
them O
on O
the O
|
     | O
bed O
carefully O
, O
while O
the O
other O
things O
were O
tossed O
impatiently O
out O
upon O
the O
floor O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
copy O
of O
Bamford B-ORG
's O
lines O
was O
not O
there O
. O
Oh O
! O
perhaps O
he O
might O
have O
given O
it O
away O
  O
but O
then O
|
     | O
must O
it O
not O
have O
been O
to O
Jem B-PERSON
? O
It O
was O
his O
gun O
. O
| 
  | O
And O
she O
set O
to O
with O
redoubled O
vigour O
to O
examine O
the O
deal O
- O
box O
which O
served O
as O
chair O
, O
and O
which O
|
     | O
had O
once O
contained O
her O
father O
's O
Sunday B-DATE
clothes O
, O
in O
the B-DATE
days I-DATE
when O
he O
could O
afford O
to O
have O
Sunday B-DATE
|
     | O
clothes O
. O
| 
  | O
He O
had O
redeemed O
his O
better O
coat O
from O
the O
pawn O
- O
shop O
before O
he O
left O
, O
that O
she O
had O
noticed O
. O
Here O
|
     | O
was O
his O
old O
one O
. O
What O
rustled O
under O
her O
hand O
in O
the O
pocket O
? O
| 
  | O
The O
paper O
! O
" O
Oh O
! O
Father O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
Yes O
, O
it O
fitted O
  O
jagged O
end O
to O
jagged O
end O
, O
letter O
to O
letter O
  O
and O
even O
the O
part O
which O
Esther B-PERSON
|
     | O
had O
considered O
blank O
had O
its O
tallying O
mark O
with O
the O
larger O
piece O
, O
its O
tails O
of O
|  | O
y O
| | O
s O
and O
|
        | O
g O
| | O
s. O
And O
then O
, O
as O
if O
that O
were O
not O
damning O
evidence O
enough O
, O
she O
felt O
again O
, O
and O
found O
|
     | O
some O
bullets O
or O
shot O
( O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
which O
you O
would O
call O
them O
) O
in O
that O
same O
pocket O
, O
along O
with O
a O
|
     | O
small O
paper O
parcel O
of O
gunpowder O
. O
As O
she O
was O
going O
to O
replace O
the O
jacket O
, O
having O
abstracted O
the O
|
     | O
paper O
, O
and O
bullets O
, O
& O
amp c O
. O
, O
she O
saw O
a O
woollen O
gun O
- O
case O
made O
of O
that O
sort O
of O
striped O
|
     | O
horse O
- O
cloth O
you O
must O
have O
seen O
a O
thousand B-CARDINAL
times O
appropriated O
to O
such O
a O
purpose O
. O
The O
sight O
of O
it O
|
     | O
made O
her O
examine O
still O
further O
, O
but O
there O
was O
nothing O
else O
that O
could O
afford O
any O
evidence O
, O
so O
|
     | O
she O
locked O
the O
box O
, O
and O
sat O
down O
on O
the O
floor O
to O
contemplate O
the O
articles O
  O
now O
with O
a O
sickening O
|
     | O
despair O
, O
now O
with O
a O
kind O
of O
wondering O
curiosity O
, O
how O
her O
father O
had O
managed O
to O
evade O
|
     | O
observation O
. O
After O
all O
it O
was O
easy O
enough O
. O
He O
had O
evidently O
got O
possession O
of O
some O
gun O
( O
was O
it O
|
     | O
really O
Jem B-PERSON
's O
  O
was O
he O
an O
accomplice O
? O
No O
! O
she O
did O
not O
believe O
it O
  O
he O
never O
, O
never O
would O
|
     | O
deliberately O
plan O
a O
murder O
with O
another O
, O
however O
he O
might O
be O
wrought O
up O
to O
it O
by O
passionate O
|
     | O
feeling O
at O
the O
time O
. O
Least O
of O
all O
would O
he O
accuse O
her O
to O
her O
father O
, O
without O
previously O
warning O
|
     | O
her O
  O
it O
was O
out O
of O
his O
nature O
) O
. O
| 
  | O
Then O
having O
obtained O
possession O
of O
the O
gun O
, O
her O
father O
had O
loaded O
it O
at O
home O
, O
and O
might O
have O
|
     | O
carried O
it O
away O
with O
him O
some O
time O
when O
the O
neighbours O
were O
not O
noticing O
, O
and O
she O
was O
out O
, O
or O
|
     | O
asleep O
  O
and O
then O
he O
might O
have O
hidden O
it O
somewhere O
to O
be O
in O
readiness O
when O
he O
should O
want O
it O
. O
|
     | O
She O
was O
sure O
he O
had O
no O
such O
thing O
with O
him O
when O
he O
went O
away O
the O
last O
time O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
felt O
it O
was O
of O
no O
use O
to O
conjecture O
his O
motives O
. O
His O
actions O
had O
become O
so O
wild O
and O
|
     | O
irregular O
of O
late O
, O
that O
she O
could O
not O
reason O
upon O
them O
. O
Besides O
, O
was O
it O
not O
enough O
to O
know O
that O
|
     | O
he O
was O
guilty O
of O
this O
terrible O
offence O
? O
Her O
love O
for O
her O
father O
seemed O
to O
return O
with O
painful O
|
     | O
force O
, O
mixed O
up O
as O
it O
was O
with O
horror O
at O
his O
crime O
. O
That O
dear O
father O
, O
who O
was O
once O
so O
kind O
, O
so O
|
     | O
warm O
- O
hearted O
, O
so O
ready O
to O
help O
either O
man O
or O
beast O
in O
distress O
, O
to O
murder O
! O
But O
, O
in O
the O
desert O
|
     | O
of O
misery O
with O
which O
these O
thoughts O
surrounded O
her O
, O
the O
arid O
depths O
of O
whose O
gloom O
she O
dared O
|
     | O
not O
venture O
to O
contemplate O
, O
a O
little O
spring O
of O
comfort O
was O
gushing O
up O
at O
her O
feet O
, O
unnoticed O
at O
|
     | O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
but O
soon O
to O
give O
her O
strength O
and O
hope O
. O
| 
  | O
And O
|  | O
that O
|  | O
was O
the O
necessity O
for O
exertion O
on O
her O
part O
which O
this O
discovery O
|
     | O
enforced O
. O
| 
  | O
Oh O
! O
I O
do O
think O
that O
the O
necessity O
for O
exertion O
, O
for O
some O
kind O
of O
action O
( O
bodily O
or O
mental O
) O
in O
|
     | O
time O
of O
distress O
, O
is O
a O
most O
infinite O
blessing O
, O
although O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
efforts O
at O
such O
seasons O
are O
|
     | O
painful O
. O
Something O
to O
be O
done O
implies O
that O
there O
is O
yet O
hope O
of O
some O
good O
thing O
to O
be O
|
     | O
accomplished O
, O
or O
some O
additional O
evil O
that O
may O
be O
avoided O
  O
and O
by O
degrees O
the O
hope O
absorbs O
much O
|
     | O
of O
the O
sorrow O
. O
| 
  | O
It O
is O
the O
woes O
that O
can O
not O
in O
any O
earthly O
way O
be O
escaped O
that O
admit O
least O
earthly O
comforting O

Of O
all O
trite O

The O

Give O

what O
my O

But O
some O
remedy O
to O
Mary B-PERSON

sorrow O
came O
with O
thinking O

If O
her O
father O
was O
guilty O

Jem B-PERSON
was O

     | O
innocent O

If O
innocent O

there O
was O
a O
possibility O
of O

him O

He O
must O
be O
saved O
. O
And O
she O
must O
do O
|
     | O
it O
  O
for O
was O
not O
she O
the O
sole O
depository O
of O
the O
terrible O
secret O
? O
Her O
father O
was O
not O
suspected O
  O

     | O
and O
never O
should O
be O
, O
if O
by O
any O
foresight O

any O
exertions O
of O
her O
own O
she O
could O
prevent O
it O
. O

  | O
She O
did O
not O
yet O
know O
how O
Jem B-PERSON
was O
to O
be O
saved O
, O
while O
her O
father O
was O
also O
to O
be O
considered O
|
     | O
innocent O
. O
It O
would O
require O
much O
thought O
and O
much O
prudence O
. O
But O
with O
the O
call O
upon O
her O

     | O
exertions O
, O
and O
her O
various O
qualities O

the O

the O

every O

was O
of O
consequence O
  O
for O
you O

remember O
she O

learnt O
at O
Miss O
Simmonds B-PERSON

the O

And O
you O
must O
remember O
, O

     | O
too O
, O
that O
never O
was O
so O
young O
a O

penniless O

as O
Mary B-PERSON
was O
at O
this O

     | O
But O
the O
lion O
accompanied O
Una B-ORG

the O
danger O
  O

  | O
It O
struck O
two B-CARDINAL
  O
deep O
, O
mirk O
, O
night B-TIME
. O
| 
  | O
It O
was O
of O
no O
use O
bewildering O
herself O
with O
plans O
this O
weary O
, O
endless O
night O
. O
Nothing O
could O
be O

     | O
done O
before O
morning O
: O
and O
, O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
in O
her O
impatience O
, O
she O
began O
to O
long O
for O
day B-DATE
  O
but O
then O
she O
|
     | O
felt O
in O
how O
unfit O
a O
state O
her O
body O
was O
for O
any O
plan O
of O
exertion O
, O
and O
she O
resolutely O
made O
up O
her O
|
     | O
mind O
to O
husband O
her O
physical O
strength O
. O
| 
  | O
First B-ORDINAL
of O
all O
she O
must O
burn O
the O
tell O
- O
tale O
paper O
. O
The O
powder O
, O
bullets O
, O
and O
gun O
- O
case O
, O
she O
tied O
|
     | O
into O
a O
bundle O
, O
and O
hid O
in O
the O
sacking O
of O
the O
bed O
for O
the O
present O
, O
although O
there O
was O
no O
|
     | O
likelihood O
of O
their O
affording O
evidence O
against O
any O
one O
. O
Then O
she O
carried O
the O
paper O
down O
stairs O
, O
|
     | O
and O
burnt O
it O
on O
the O
hearth O
, O
powdering O
the O
very O
ashes O
with O
her O
fingers O
, O
and O
dispersing O
the O
|
     | O
fragments O
of O
fluttering O
black O
films O
among O
the O
cinders O
of O
the O
grate O
. O
Then O
she O
breathed O
|
     | O
again O
. O
| 
  | O
Her O
head O
ached O
with O
dizzying O
violence O
  O
she O
must O
get O
quit O
of O
the O
pain O
or O
it O
would O
incapacitate O
|
     | O
her O
for O
thinking O
and O
planning O
. O
She O
looked O
for O
food O
, O
but O
there O
was O
nothing O
but O
a O
little O
raw O
|
     | O
oatmeal O
in O
the O
house O
: O
still O
, O
although O
it O
almost O
choked O
her O
, O
she O
ate O
some O
of O
this O
, O
knowing O
from O
|
     | O
experience O
, O
how O
often O
headaches O
were O
caused O
by O
long O
fasting O
. O
Then O
she O
sought O
for O
some O
water O
to O
|
     | O
bathe O
her O
throbbing O
temples O
, O
and O
quench O
her O
feverish O
thirst O
. O
There O
was O
none O
in O
the O
house O
, O
so O
|
     | O
she O
took O
the O
jug O
and O
went O
out O
to O
the O
pump O
at O
the O
other O
end O
of O
the O
court O
, O
whose O
echoes O
resounded O
|
     | O
her O
light O
footsteps O
in O
the O
quiet O
stillness O
of O
the O
night O
. O
The O
hard O
, O
square O
outlines O
of O
the O
|
     | O
houses O
cut O
sharply O
against O
the O
cold O
bright O
sky O
, O
from O
which O
myriads O
of O
stars O
were O
shining O
down O
|
     | O
in O
eternal O
repose O
. O
There O
was O
little O
sympathy O
in O
the O
outward O
scene O
, O
with O
the O
internal O
trouble O
. O
|
     | O
All O
was O
so O
still O
, O
so O
motionless O
, O
so O
hard O
! O
Very O
different O
to O
this O
lovely O
night O
in O
the O
country O
in O
|
     | O
which O
I O
am O
now O
writing O
, O
where O
the O
distant O
horizon O
is O
soft O
and O
undulating O
in O
the O
moonlight O
, O
and O
|
     | O
the O
nearer O
trees O
sway O
gently O
to O
and O
fro O
in O
the O
night O
- O
wind O
with O
something O
of O
almost O
human O
|
     | O
motion O
  O
and O
the O
rustling O
air O
makes O
music O
among O
their O
branches O
, O
as O
if O
speaking O
soothingly O
to O
the O
|
     | O
weary O
ones O
who O
lie O
awake O
in O
heaviness O
of O
heart O
. O
The O
sights O

of O
such O
a O
night O
lull O
pain O

     | O

grief O
to O
rest O

But O
Mary B-PERSON
re O
- O
entered O
her O
home O
after O
she O
had O
filled O
her O
pitcher O
, O
with O
a O
still O
stronger O
sense O
of O
|
     | O
anxiety O
, O
and O
a O
still O
clearer O
conviction O
of O
how O
much O
rested O
upon O
her O
unassisted O
and O
friendless O
|
     | O
self O
, O
alone O
with O
her O
terrible O
knowledge O
, O
in O
the O
hard O
, O
cold O
, O
populous O
world O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
bathed O
her O
forehead O
, O
and O
quenched O
her O
thirst O
, O
and O
then O
, O
with O
wise O
deliberation O
of O
|
     | O
purpose O
, O
went O
upstairs O
, O
and O
undressed O
herself O
, O
as O
if O
for O
a B-TIME
long I-TIME
night I-TIME
's O
slumber O
, O
although O
so O
|
     | O
few O
hours O
intervened O
before O
day O
- O
dawn O
. O
She O
believed O
she O
never O
could O
sleep O
, O
but O
she O
lay O
down O
, O
and O
|
     | O
shut O
her O
eyes O
  O
and O
before O
many O
minutes O
she O
was O
in O
as O
deep O
and O
sound O
a O
slumber O
as O
if O
there O
was O
|
     | O
no O
sin O
nor O
sorrow O
in O
the O
world O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
awakened O
, O
as O
it O
was O
natural O
, O
much O
refreshed O
in O
body O
  O
but O
with O
a O
consciousness O
of O
some O

     | O
great O
impending O
calamity O
. O
She O
sat O
up O
in O
bed O
to O
recollect O
, O
and O
when O
she O
did O
remember O
, O
she O
sank O

     | O
down O
again O
with O
all O
the O
helplessness O
of O
despair O
. O
But O
it O
was O
only O
the O
weakness O
of O
an O
instant O
  O

     | O
for O
were O
not O

setting O
her O

she O
was O
not O

determined O
to O
apply O
to O

as O
one B-CARDINAL
of O

No O

She O
went O
straight O
to O
Job B-PERSON

found O
the O
old O

his O

     | O
grand O

daughter O
sitting O
at O
breakfast O

she O
opened O

speaking O
in O

     | O
a O
grave O

hushed O

something O

They O
stopped O
talking O
on O

her O
entrance O

then O
she O
knew O
they O

conversing O
about O
the O

  O
about O
Jem B-PERSON

probable O

( O
it O
flashed O
upon O
her O
for O

on O
the O

would O
have O
obtained O

     | O
regarding O
herself O
: O
for O
until O
now O
they O
had O
never O

giddy O
flirting O

Mr. O

     | O
not O

she O
ever O
spoken O

And O
now O
Margaret B-PERSON

     | O
would O
hear O
her O
conduct O
talked O

by O
all O

as O
that O
of O
a O
bold O

not O

every O

So O
it O
was O

a O

that O
Mary B-PERSON
wished O
her O
usual O

Job B-PERSON

in O
an O
agony O

he O
had O
no O

the O
murderer O

And O

     | O
he O
was O
strongly O
inclined O

that O

aware O

only O
that O

too O

of O

the O

be O
more O
convinced O
by O
inquiry O

     | O

sat O
silent O

grave O
all O
this O

the O
truth O

she O
was O
surprised O

     | O
disappointed O
by O
the O
disclosure O
of O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
conduct O
, O
with O
regard O
to O
Mr. O
Henry B-PERSON
Carson I-PERSON
. O
Gentle O
, O

     | O
reserved O
, O

prudent O
herself O

never O
exposed O

the O
trial O
of O

, O
at O
sight O

sound O

     | O
thought O
of O
Will B-PERSON
Wilson I-PERSON
, O
was O
love O

not,—Margaret O
had O
no O
sympathy O
with O

which O

     | O
loveliness O

  O
no O
sympathy O

Then O
, O
she O
had O
no O
idea O
of O
the O
strength O
of O
the O
conflict O
between O

in O
some O
who O
were O
differently O
constituted O
from O
herself O

With O
her O
, O
to O
be O
convinced O
|
     | O
that O
an O
action O
was O
wrong O
, O
was O
tantamount O
to O
a O
determination O
not O
to O
do O

again O
  O

she O
had O

     | O
little O
or O
no O
difficulty O
in O
carrying O

So O
she O
could O
not O
understand O
how O
it O
|
     | O
was O
that O
Mary B-PERSON
had O
acted O
wrongly O
, O
and O
had O
felt O
too O
much O
ashamed O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
all O
internal O
|
     | O
sophistry O
, O
to O
speak O
of O
her O
actions O
. O
Margaret B-PERSON
considered O
herself O
deceived O
  O
felt O
aggrieved O
  O
and O
, O
|
     | O
at O
the O
time O
of O
which O
I O
am O
now O
telling O
you O
, O
was O
strongly O
inclined O
to O
give O
Mary B-PERSON
up O
altogether O
, O
as O

     | O
a O
girl O
devoid O
of O
the O
modest O
proprieties O
of O
her O
sex O
, O
and O
capable O
of O
gross O
duplicity O
, O
in O
speaking O

     | O
of O
one B-CARDINAL
lover O

she O
had O
done O
of O
Jem B-PERSON

while O
she O
was O
encouraging O
another O
in O
attentions O
, O
at O
best O

     | O
of O
a O
very O
doubtful O
character O
. O
| 
  | O
But O
now O
Margaret B-PERSON
was O
drawn O
into O
the O
conversation O
. O
Suddenly O
it O
flashed O
across O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
mind O
, O
|
     | O
that O
the B-TIME
night I-TIME
of O
the O
murder O
was O
the B-TIME
very I-TIME
night I-TIME
, O
or O
rather O
the O
same O
early B-TIME
morning I-TIME
, O
that O

     | O
Margaret B-PERSON
had O
been O
with O
Alice B-PERSON
. O
She O
turned O
sharp O
round O
, O
with O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
Oh O
! O
Margaret B-PERSON
, O
you O
can O
tell O
me O
  O
you O
were O
there O
when O
he O
came O
back O
that O
night O
  O
were O
you O
not O

     | O
No O
! O
you O
were O
not O
  O
but O
you O
were O
there O
not O
many B-TIME
hours I-TIME
after O
. O
Did O
not O
you O
hear O
where O
he O
'd O
been O
? O
He O

     | O
was O
away O
the O
night O
before O
, O
too O
, O
when O
Alice B-PERSON
was O
first B-ORDINAL
taken O
  O
when O
you O
were O
there O
for O
your O
tea O
. O
|
     | O
Oh O
! O
where O
was O
he O
, O
Margaret B-PERSON
? O
" O

  | O
" O
I O
do O
n't O
know O

she O
answered O
. O
" O

! O
I O
do O
remember O
something O
about O
his O
keeping O

company O

     | O
in O
his O
walk O
to O
Liverpool B-GPE

I O
ca O
n't O
justly O
say O
what O
it O
was O

so O
much O
happened O
that O
night O

" O

" O
I O
'll O
go O
to O
his O
mother O

said O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
resolutely O
. O
| 
  | O
They O
neither O
of O
them O
spoke O
, O
either O
to O
advise O
or O
dissuade O
. O
Mary B-PERSON
felt O
she O
had O
no O
sympathy O
from O
|
     | O
them O
, O
and O
braced O
up O
her O
soul O
to O
act O
without O
such O
loving O
aid O
of O
friendship O
. O
She O
knew O
that O
their O

     | O
advice O
would O
be O
willingly O
given O
at O
her O
demand O

all O

really O
required O
for O
Jem B-PERSON

sake O

Still O
her O
courage O
failed O
a O
little O
as O
she O
walked O
to O
Jane B-PERSON
Wilson I-PERSON

| 
  | O
Jane B-PERSON
Wilson I-PERSON

eyes O
were O
swelled O
with O
crying O

it O
was O
sad O
to O
see O
the O
ravages O
which O
intense O

     | O
anxiety O

Mrs. O

crooned O
over O

something O

grown O
to O

  | O
She O
fell O
to O
sobbing O
, O
in O
the O
convulsive O
breath O
- O
catching O
manner O
which O
tells O

of O

tell O
thee O
they O

" O
interrupted O
Mrs. O
Wilson B-PERSON
, O
half B-CARDINAL
- O
irritated O
at O
the O
light O
way O
, O
as O
she O
|
     | O
considered O
it O
, O
in O
which O
Mary B-PERSON
spoke O
  O
and O
a O
little O
displeased O
that O
another O
could O
hope O
when O
she O

     | O
had O
almost O
brought O
herself O
to O
find O
pleasure O
in O
despair O

" O
It O
may O
suit O
thee O
well O

continued O
she O

" O
to O
make O
light O
o O
' O
the O
misery O
thou O
hast O
caused O
  O

I O

     | O
shall O
lay O
his O
death O
at O
thy O

as O
long O
as O
I O
live O

die O
I O
know O
he O

all O
for O
what O
he O

     | O
never O

no O
, O
he O
never O

blessed O
boy O

" O
| 
  | O
She O
was O
too O
weak O
to O
be O
angry O
long O
  O
her O
wrath O
sank O
away O
to O
feeble O
sobbing O
and O
worn O
- O
out O

     | O
moans B-NORP
. O
| 
  | O
Mary B-PERSON
was O
most O
anxious O
to O
soothe O
her O
from O
any O
violence O
of O
either O
grief O
or O
anger O
  O
she O
did O
so O

     | O
want O
her O
to O
be O
clear O
in O
her O
recollection O
  O
and O
, O
besides O
, O
her O
tenderness O
was O
great O
towards O
Jem B-PERSON
's O
|
     | O
mother O
. O
So O
she O
spoke O
in O
a O
low O
gentle O
tone O
the O
loving O
sentences O
, O
which O
sound O
so O
broken O
and O
|
     | O
powerless O
in O
repetition O
, O
and O
which O
yet O
have O
so O
much O
power O
when O
accompanied O
with O
caressing O
looks O

     | O
and O
actions O
, O
fresh O
from O
the O
heart O
  O
and O
the O
old O
woman O
insensibly O
gave O
herself O
up O
to O
the O

     | O
influence O
of O
those O
sweet O
, O
loving O
blue O
eyes O
, O
those O
tears O
of O
sympathy O
, O
those O
words O
of O
love O
and O

     | O
hope O
, O
and O
was O
lulled O
into O
a O
less O
morbid O
state O
of O
mind O
. O

" O
And O

, O
dear O

that O
Mary B-PERSON
felt O

  | O
Mary B-PERSON
went O
up O

stairs O
: O
partly O
because O
it O
is O
the O
etiquette O

etiquette O
forbids O
a O
refusal O
of O

invitation O

the O

totally O

absorbed O

were O
vivid O

enough O

she O
talked O

still O
she O

spoke O

her O

the O
voice O

fainter O

how O

happily O
! O

Mary B-PERSON
stood O
for O
a O
time O
in O
silence O

watching O

Then O
she O
bent O
down O

kissed O

away O

the O
belief O

not O

if O

there O
arose O
the O

     | O
question,—if O
all O

against O

forth O

had O
the O

do O
, O

her O
terrible O
knowledge O

     | O
Surely O
not O

— O

— O
she O
almost O
prayed O
for O
the O
blessed O

unconsciousness O

now O

still O

memory O
enough O

arrange O

the O

out O

when O
in O

     | O

you O

Alice B-PERSON

memory O
was O
clear O

on O

     | O
all O
points O
in O
which O
her O
heart O
was O
interested O
, O
was O
lying O
in O
a O
manner O
senseless O
: O
that O
Jane B-PERSON

     | O
was O
( O
to O
use O
her O
own O
word O
, O
so O
expressive O
to O
a O
Lancashire B-PERSON
ear O
) O
" O
dazed O
, O
" O
that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
|
     | O
bewildered O
, O
lost O
in O
the O
confusion O
of O
terrifying O
and O
distressing O
thoughts O
  O
incapable O
of O

     | O
concentrating O
her O
mind O
  O

at O
the O
best O
of O
times O
Will O

proceedings O
were O
a O
matter O
of O
little O
|
     | O
importance O
to O
her O
( O
or O
so O
she O
pretended O
) O
, O
she O
was O
so O
jealous O
of O
aught O
which O
distracted O
attention O
|
     | O
from O
her O
pearl O
of O
price O
, O
her O
only O
son O
Jem B-PERSON
. O
So O
Mary B-PERSON
felt O
hopeless O
of O
obtaining O
any O
intelligence O
|
     | O
of O
the O
sailor O
's O
arrangements O
from O
her O
. O
| 
  | O
Then O
, O
should O
she O
apply O
to O
Jem B-PERSON
himself O
? O
No O
! O
she O
knew O
him O
too O
well O
. O
She O
felt O
how O
thoroughly O
he O
|
     | O
must O
ere O
now O
have O
had O
it O
in O
his O
power O
to O
exculpate O
himself O
at O
another O
's O
expense O
. O
And O
his O
tacit O
|
     | O
refusal O
so O
to O
do O
had O
assured O
her O
of O
what O
she O
had O
never O
doubted O
, O
that O
the O
murderer O
was O
safe O
from O
|
     | O
any O
impeachment O
of O
his O
. O
But O
then O
neither O
would O
he O
consent O
, O
she O
feared O
, O
to O
any O
steps O
which O
might O
|
     | O
tend O
to O
prove O
himself O
innocent O
. O
At O
any O
rate O
, O
she O
could O
not O
consult O
him O
. O
He O
was O
removed O
to O
|
     | O
Kirkdale O
, O
and O
time O
pressed O
. O
Already O
it O
was O
Saturday B-DATE
at O
noon B-TIME

And O
even O
if O
she O
could O
have O
gone O
to O
|
     | O
him O
, O
I O
believe O
she O
would O
not O
. O
She O
longed O
to O
do O
all O
herself O
  O
to O
be O
his O
liberator O
, O
his O
deliverer O
  O
|
     | O
to O
win O
him O
life O
, O
though O
she O
might O
never O
regain O
his O
lost O
love O
, O
by O
her O
own O
exertions O
. O
And O
oh O
! O
how O
|
     | O
could O
she O
see O
him O
to O
discuss O
a O
subject O
in O
which O
both O
knew O
who O
was O
the O
blood O

stained O
man O
  O
and O

     | O
yet O
whose O
name O
might O
not O
be O
breathed O
by O
either O
, O
so O
dearly O
with O
all O
his O
faults O

was O

All O
at O
once O
, O
when O
she O
had O
ceased O
to O
try O
and O
remember O
, O
the O
name O
of O
Will B-PERSON

flashed O

repeated O

over O

over O

all O

thought O
of O
that O
? O
" O

  | O
Mary B-PERSON
had O
not O
, O
and O
felt O
sure O
his O
mother O
had O
not O
. O
| 
  | O
Margaret B-PERSON
confirmed O
this O
last O
supposition O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
've O
but O
just O
been O
there O
, O
and O
poor O
Jane B-PERSON
is O
like O
one B-CARDINAL
dateless O
  O
so O
many O
griefs O
come O
on O
her O
at O
|
     | O
once O
. O
One B-CARDINAL
time O
she O
seems O
to O
make O
sure O
he O
'll O
be O
hung O
  O
and O
if O
I O
took O
her O
in O
that O
way O
, O
she O
flew O
|
     | O
out O
( O
poor O
body O
! O
) O
and O
said O
, O
that O
in O
spite O
of O
what O
folk O
said O
, O
there O
were O
them O
as O
could O
, O
and O
would O
|
     | O
prove O
him O
guiltless O
. O
So O
I O
never O
knew O
where O
to O
have O
her O
. O
The O
only O
thing O
she O
was O
constant O
in O
, O
was O
|
     | O
declaring O
him O
innocent O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Mother O
- O
like O
! O
" O
said O
Job B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
" O
She O
meant O
Will O
, O
when O
she O
spoke O
of O
them O
that O
could O
prove O
him O
innocent O
. O
He O
was O
with O
Will O
on O
|
     | O
Thursday B-DATE
night B-TIME
, O
walking O
a O
part O
of O
the O
way O
with O
him O
to O
Liverpool B-GPE
  O
now O
the O
thing O
is O
to O
lay O
hold O
|
     | O
on O
Will O
and O
get O
him O
to O
prove O
this O
. O
" O
So O
spoke O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
calm O
, O
from O
the O
earnestness O
of O
her O
|
     | O
purpose O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Do O
n't O
build O
too O
much O
on O
it O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
" O
said O
Job B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
do O
build O
on O
it O
, O
" O
replied O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
" O
because O
I O
know O
it O
's O
the O
truth O
, O
and O
I O
mean O
to O
try O
and O
prove O

     | O
it O
, O
come O
what O
may O
. O
Nothing O
you O
can O
say O
will O
daunt O
me O
, O
Job B-PERSON
, O
so O
do O
n't O
you O
go O
and O
try O
. O
You O
may O
|
     | O
help O
, O
but O
you O
can O
not O
hinder O
me O
doing O
what O
I O
'm O
resolved O
on O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
They O
respected O
her O
firmness O
of O
determination O
, O
and O
Job B-PERSON
almost O
gave O
in O
to O
her O
belief O
, O
when O
he O
|
     | O
saw O
how O
steadfastly O
she O
was O
acting O
upon O
it O
. O
Oh O
! O
surest O
way O
of O
conversion O
to O
our O
faith O
, O
whatever O
|
     | O
it O
may O
be,—regarding O
either O
small O
things O
, O
or O
great,—when O
it O
is O
beheld O
as O
the O
actuating O
|
     | O
principle O
, O
from O
which O
we O
never O
swerve O
! O
When O
it O
is O
seen O
that O
, O
instead O
of O
over O
- O
much O
profession O
, O
|
     | O
it O
is O
worked O
into O
the O
life O
, O
and O
moves O
every O
action O
! O
| 
  | O
Mary B-PERSON
gained O
courage O
as O
she O
instinctively O
felt O
she O
had O
made O
way O
with O
one O
at O

of O
her O

     | O
companions O

  | O
" O
Now O
I O
'm O
clear O
about O
this O
much O
, O
" O
she O
continued O
, O
" O

stopped O

" O
| 
  | O
Mary B-PERSON
had O
been O
too O
much O
engrossed O
by O
watching O
what O
was O
passing O
in O
the O
street O
to O
attend O
very O
|
     | O
closely O
to O
that O
which O
Margaret B-PERSON
was O
saying O
. O
From O
her O
seat O
she O
could O
see O
out O
of O
the O
window O
pretty O
|
     | O
plainly O
, O
and O
she O
caught O
sight O
of O
a O
gentleman O
walking O
alongside O
of O
Job B-GPE
, O
evidently O
in O
earnest O
|
     | O
conversation O
with O
him O
, O
and O
looking O
keen O
and O
penetrating O
enough O
to O
be O
a O
lawyer O
. O
Job O
was O
laying O
|
     | O
down O
something O
to O
be O
attended O
to O
she O
could O
see O
, O
by O
his O
up O
- O
lifted O
fore O
- O
finger O
, O
and O
his O
whole O

     | O
gesture O
  O
then O
he O
pointed O
and O
nodded O
across O
the O
street O
to O
his O
own O
house O
, O
as O
if O
inducing O
his O

     | O
companion O
to O
come O
in O

Mary B-PERSON
dreaded O
lest O
he O
should O
, O
and O
she O
be O
subjected O
to O
a O
closer O
|
     | O
cross O
- O
examination O
than O
she O
had O
hitherto O
undergone O
, O
as O
to O
why O
she O
was O
so O
certain O
that O
Jem B-PERSON
was O
|
     | O
innocent O
. O
She O
feared O
he O
was O
coming O
  O
he O
stepped O
a O
little O
towards O
the O
spot O
. O
No O
! O
it O
was O
only O
to O

     | O
make O
way O
for O
a O
child O
, O
tottering O
along O
, O
whom O
Mary B-PERSON
had O
overlooked O
. O
Now O
Job B-PERSON
took O
him O
by O
the O

     | O
button O
, O
so O
earnestly O
familiar O
had O
he O
grown O
. O
The O
gentleman O
looked O
" O
fidging O
fain O
" O
to O
be O
gone O
, O
but O
|
     | O
submitted O
in O
a O
manner O
that O
made O
Mary B-PERSON
like O
him O
in O
spite O
of O
his O
profession O
. O
Then O
came O
a O
volley O
of O
|
     | O
last O
words O
, O
answered O
by O
briefest O
nods O
, O
and O
monosyllables O
  O
and O
then O
the O
stranger O
went O
off O
with O

     | O
redoubled O
quickness O
of O
pace O
, O
and O
Job B-PERSON
crossed O
the O
street O
with O
a O
little O
satisfied O
air O
of O

     | O
importance O

his O
kindly O
face O

Mary B-PERSON
could O
not O
be O
patient O
in O
her O
loneliness O
  O
so O
much O
painful O
thought O
weighed O
on O
her O
mind O
  O
the O
|
     | O
very O
house O
was O
haunted O
with O
memories O
and O
foreshadowings O
. O

  | O
Having O
performed O
all O
duties O
to O
Jem B-PERSON
, O
as O
far O
as O
her O
weak O
powers O
, O
yet O
loving O

could O
act O
  O

over O

father O

beyond O
which O
she O

     | O
could O
not O
penetrate O
to O
judge O
of O
any O
filial O
service O
she O
ought O
to O
render O
  O
her O
mind O
unconsciously O
|
     | O
sought O
after O
some O
course O
of O
action O
in O
which O
she O
might O
engage O
. O
Any O
thing O
, O
any O
thing O
, O
rather O
than O

     | O
leisure O
for O
reflection O
. O
| 
  | O
And O
then O
came O
up O
the O
old O
feeling O
which O
first B-ORDINAL
bound O
Ruth B-PERSON
to O
Naomi O
  O
the O
love O
they O
both O
held O
|
     | O
towards O
one O
object O
  O
and O
Mary B-PERSON
felt O
that O
her O
cares O
would O
be O
most O
lightened O
by O
being O
of O
use O
, O
or O
of O

     | O
comfort O
to O
his O
mother O
. O
So O
she O
once O
more O
locked O
up O
the O
house O
, O
and O
set O
off O
towards O
Ancoats O
  O
|
     | O
rushing O
along O
with O
down O
- O
cast O
head O
, O
for O
fear O
lest O
any O
one O
should O
recognise O
her O
and O
arrest O
her O

     | O
progress O
. O
| 
  | O
Jane B-PERSON
Wilson I-PERSON
sat O
quietly O
in O
her O
chair O
as O
Mary B-PERSON
entered O
  O
so O
quietly O
, O
as O
to O
strike O
one O
by O
the O
|
     | O
contrast O
it O
presented O
to O
her O
usual O
bustling O
and O
nervous O
manner O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
looked O
very O
pale O
and O
wan O
  O
but O
the O
quietness O
was O
the O
thing O
that O
struck O
Mary B-PERSON
most O
. O
She O
did O
|
     | O
not O
rise O
as O
Mary B-PERSON
came O
in O
, O
but O
sat O
still O
and O
said O
something O
in O
so O
gentle O
, O
so O
feeble O
a O
voice O
, O
|
     | O
that O
Mary B-PERSON
did O
not O
catch O
it O
. O
| 
  | O
Mrs. O
Davenport B-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
there O
, O
plucked O
Mary B-PERSON
by O
the O
gown O
, O
and O
whispered O
, O
| 
  | O
" O
Never O

her O

. O
" O
| 
  | O
But O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
touched O
by O
the O
anxious O
look O
with O
which O
Mrs. O
Wilson B-PERSON
gazed O
at O
her O
, O
as O
if O
awaiting O
the O
|
     | O
answer O
to O
some O
question O
, O
went O
forward O
to O
listen O
to O
the O
speech O
she O
was O
again O
repeating O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
What O
is O
this O
? O
will O
you O
tell O
me O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
Then O
Mary B-PERSON
looked O
and O
saw O
another O
ominous O
slip O
of O
parchment O
in O
the O
mother O
's O
hand O
, O
which O
she O
|
     | O
was O
rolling O
up O
and O
down O

a O
tremulous O
manner O
between O
her O
fingers O

| 
  | O
Mary B-PERSON

heart O
sickened O
within O
her O
, O

she O
could O
not O

" O

she O
repeated O
. O
" O

" O
She O
still O
looked O
at O
Mary B-PERSON

with O
the O
same O

     | O
child O
- O
like O
gaze O

" O

  | O
" O
She O
has O
had O
no O
sleep O
for O
many B-DATE
nights I-DATE
, O
" O
said O
the O
girl O
to O
Mrs. O
Davenport B-PERSON
, O
" O
and O
all O
this O
woe O
|
     | O
and O
sorrow,—it B-PERSON
's O
no O
wonder O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
No O
, O
indeed O
! O
" O
Mrs. O
Davenport B-PERSON
answered O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
We O
must O
get O
her O
fairly O
to O
bed O
  O
we O
must O
get O
her O
undressed O
, O
and O
all O
  O
and O
trust O
to O
God O
, O
in O
His O
|
     | O
mercy O
, O
to O
send O
her O
to O
sleep O
, O
or O
else O
, O
— O
" O
| 
  | O
For O
, O
you O
see O
, O
they O
spoke O
before O
her O
as O
if O
she O
were O
not O
there O
  O
her O
heart O
was O
so O
far O
away O
. O
| 
  | O
Accordingly O
they O
almost O
lifted O
her O
from O
the O
chair O
in O
which O
she O
sat O
motionless O
, O
and O
taking O
her O
|
     | O
up O
as O
gently O
as O
a O
mother O
carries O
her O
sleeping O
baby O
, O
they O
undressed O
her O
poor O
, O
worn O
form O
, O
and O
|
     | O
laid O
her O
in O
the O
little O
bed O
up O
- O
stairs O
. O
They O
had O
once O
thought O
of O
placing O
her O
in O
Jem B-PERSON
's O
bed O
, O
to O
be O
|
     | O
out O
of O
sight O
or O
sound O
of O
any O
disturbance O
of O
Alice B-PERSON
's O
, O
but O
then O
again O
they O
remembered O
the O
shock O
|
     | O
she O
might O
receive O
in O
awakening O
in O
so O
unusual O
a O
place O
, O
and O
also O
that O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
who O
intended O
to O
keep O
|
     | O
vigil O
that O
night O
in O
the O
house O
of O
mourning O
, O
would O
find O
it O
difficult O
to O
divide O
her O
attention O
in O
|
     | O
the O
possible O
cases O
that O
might O
ensue O
. O
| 
  | O
So O
they O
laid O
her O
, O
as O
I O
said O
before O
, O
on O
that O
little O
pallet O
- O
bed O
  O
and O
, O
as O
they O
were O
slowly O
|
     | O
withdrawing O
from O
the O
bed O
- O
side O
, O
hoping O
and O
praying O
that O
she O
might O
sleep O
, O
and O
forget O
for O
a O
time O
|
     | O
her O
heavy O
burden O
, O
she O
looked O
wistfully O
after O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
and O
whispered O
, O
| 
  | O
" O
You O
have O
n't O
told O
me O
what O
it O
is O
. O
What O
is O
it O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
And O
gazing O
in O
her O
face O
for O
the O
expected O
answer O
, O
her O
eye O
- O
lids O
slowly O
closed O
, O
and O
she O
fell O
into O
|
     | O
a O
deep O
, O
heavy O
sleep O
, O
almost O
as O
profound O
a O
rest O
as O
death O
. O
| 
  | O
Mrs. O
Davenport B-PERSON
went O
her O
way O
, O
and O
Mary B-PERSON
was O
alone,—for O
I O
can O
not O
call O
those O
who O
sleep O
allies O
|
     | O
against O
the O
agony O
of O
thought O
which O
solitude O
sometimes O
brings O
up O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
dreaded O
the O
night O
before O
her O
. O
Alice B-PERSON
might O
die O
  O
the O
doctor O
had O
that O
day O
declared O
her O
case O
|
     | O
hopeless O
, O
and O
not O
far O
from O
death O
  O
and O
at O
times O
the O
terror O
, O
so O
natural O
to O
the O
young O
, O
not O
of O
|
     | O
death O
, O
but O
of O
the O
remains O
of O
the O
dead O
, O
came O
over O
Mary B-PERSON
  O
and O
she O
bent O
and O
listened O
anxiously O
for O
|
     | O
the O
long O
- O
drawn O
, O
pausing O
breath O
of O
the O
sleeping O
Alice B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
Or O
Mrs. O
Wilson B-PERSON
might O
awake O
in O
a O
state O
which O
Mary B-PERSON
dreaded O
to O
anticipate O
, O
and O
anticipated O
while O
|
     | O
she O
dreaded —in O
a O
state O
of O
complete O
delirium O
. O
Already O
her O
senses O
had O
been O
severely O
stunned O
by O
|
     | O
the O
full O
explanation O
of O
what O
was O
required O
of O
her,—of O
what O
she O
had O
to O
prove O
against O
her O
son O
, O
her O
|
     | O
Jem B-PERSON
, O
her O
only O
child,—which O
Mary B-PERSON
could O
not O
doubt O
the O
officious O
Mrs. O
Heming B-PERSON
had O
given O
  O
and O
what O
|
     | O
if O
in O
dreams O
( O
that O
land O
into O
which O
no O
sympathy O
or O
love O
can O
penetrate O
with O
another O
, O
either O
to O
|
     | O
share O
its O
bliss O
or O
its O
agony,—that O
land O
whose O
scenes O
are O
unspeakable O
terrors O
, O
are O
hidden O

     | O
mysteries O
, O
are O
priceless O
treasures O
to O
one O
alone,—that O
land O

alone O
I O
may O
see O
, O

yet O
I O

     | O
tarry O
here O
, O
the O
sweet O
looks O
of O
my O
dead O
child),—what O
if O
, O
in O
the O
horrors O
of O
her O
dreams O
, O
her O
brain O
|
     | O
should O
go O
still O
more O
astray O
, O
and O
she O
should O
waken O
crazy O
with O
her O
visions O
, O
and O
the O
terrible O
|
     | O
reality O
that O
begot O
them O
? O
| 
  | O
How O
much O
worse O
is O
anticipation O
sometimes O
than O
reality O
! O
How O
Mary B-PERSON
dreaded O
that O
night O
, O
and O
how O
|
     | O
calmly O
it O
passed O
by O
! O
Even O
more O
so O
than O
if O
Mary B-PERSON
had O
not O
had O
such O
claims O
upon O
her O
care O
! O
| 
  | O
Anxiety O
about O
them O
deadened O
her O
own O
peculiar O
anxieties O
. O
She O
thought O
of O
the O
sleepers O
whom O
she O
|
     | O
was O
watching O
, O
till O
overpowered O
herself O
by O
the O
want O
of O
rest O
, O
she O
fell O
off O
into O
short O
slumbers O
in O
|
     | O
which O
the O
night O
wore O
imperceptibly O
away O
. O
To O
be O
sure O
Alice B-PERSON
spoke O
, O
and O
sang O
, O
during O
her O
waking O
|
     | O
moments O
, O
like O
the O
child O
she O
deemed O
herself O
  O
but O
so O
happily O
with O
the O
dearly O
- O
loved O
ones O
around O

     | O
her O
, O
with O
the O
scent O
of O
the O
heather O
, O
and O
the O
song O
of O
the O
wild O
bird O
hovering O
about O
her O
in O

     | O
imagination O
— O
with O
old O
scraps O

praise O

thanksgiving O
to O

was O
already O
trembling O
on O
the O
horizon O

Then O
she O
got O
up O
from O
the O
chair O

she O
had O
been O
dozing O

went O

half B-CARDINAL

asleep O

to O

window O
to O
assure O
herself O
that B-TIME

at O

The O

No O

some O

the O
unwonted O

Men O
with O

the O

this O
Sunday B-DATE
morning B-TIME
  O

     | O
but O
to O

was O
a O
pleasure O

an O
absolute O

all O

To O
be O
sure O
, O
there O
were O
one B-CARDINAL
or O
two B-CARDINAL
passengers O
on O
that B-TIME
morning I-TIME
whose O
objects O
were O
less O
innocent O

     | O
and O
less O
praiseworthy O
than O
those O
of O
the O
people O
I O
have O
already O
mentioned O
, O
and O
whose O
animal O
state O
|
     | O
of O
mind O
and O
body O
clashed O
jarringly O
on O
the O
peacefulness O
of O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
  O
but O
upon O
them O
I O
will O
not O

     | O
dwell O
: O
as O
you O
and O
I O
, O
and O
almost O
every O
one O
, O
I O
think O
, O
may O
send O
up O
our O
individual O
cry O
of O

     | O
self O
- O
reproach O
that O
we O

all O

  | O
When O
Mary B-PERSON
turned O
from O
the O
window O
, O
she O
went O
to O
the O
bed O
of O
each O
sleeper O
, O
to O
look O
and O
listen O
. O
|
     | O
Alice B-PERSON
looked O
perfectly O
quiet O
and O
happy O
in O
her O
slumber O
, O
and O
her O
face O
seemed O
to O
have O
become O
much O

     | O
more O
youthful O
during O
her O
painless O
approach O
to O
death O
. O
| 
  | O
Mrs. O
Wilson B-PERSON
's O
countenance O
was O
stamped O
with O
the O
anxiety O
of O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
few I-DATE
days I-DATE
, O
although O
she O
, O
|
     | O
too O
, O
appeared O
sleeping O
soundly O
  O
but O
as O
Mary B-PERSON
gazed O
on O
her O
, O
trying O
to O
trace O
a O
likeness O
to O
her O
son O
|
     | O
in O
her O
face O
, O
she O
awoke O
and O
looked O
up O
into O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
eyes O
, O
while O
the O
expression O
of O
consciousness O
|
     | O
came O
back O
into O
her O
own O
. O
| 
  | O
Both O
were O
silent O
for O
a B-TIME
minute I-TIME
or O
two B-CARDINAL
. O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
eyes O
had O
fallen O
beneath O
that O
penetrating O
gaze O
, O
|
     | O
in O
which O
the O
agony O
of O
memory O
seemed O
every O
moment O
to O
find O
fuller O
vent O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Is O
it O
a O
dream O
? O
" O
the O
mother O
asked O
at O
last O
in O
a O
low O
voice O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
No O
! O
" O
replied O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
in O
the O
same O
tone O
. O
| 
  | O
Mrs. O
Wilson B-PERSON
hid O
her O
face O
in O
the O
pillow O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
was O
fully O
conscious O
of O
every O
thing O
this B-TIME
morning I-TIME
  O
it O
was O
evident O
that O
the O
stunning O
effect O
|
     | O
of O
the O
subpœna O
, O
which O
had O
affected O
her O
so O
much O
last B-TIME
night I-TIME
in O
her O
weak O
, O
worn O
- O
out O
state O
, O
had O
|
     | O
passed O
away O
. O
Mary B-PERSON
offered O
no O
opposition O
when O
she O
indicated O
by O
languid O
gesture O
and O
action O
that O
|
     | O
she O
wished O
to O
rise O
. O
A O
sleepless O
bed O
is O
a O
haunted O
place O
. O
| 
  | O
When O
she O
was O
dressed O
with O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
help O
, O
she O
stood O
by O
Alice B-PERSON
for O
a B-TIME
minute I-TIME
or O
two B-CARDINAL
, O
looking O
at O
the O

     | O
slumberer O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
How O
happy O
she O
is O
! O
" O
said O
she O
, O
quietly O
and O
sadly O
. O

All O
the O
time O
that O
Mary B-PERSON
was O
getting O
breakfast O
ready O
, O
and O
performing O
every O
other O
little O
|
     | O
domestic O
office O
she O
could O
think O
of O
, O
to O
add O
to O
the O
comfort O
of O
Jem B-PERSON
's O
mother O
, O
Mrs. O
Wilson B-PERSON
sat O
|
     | O
still O
in O
the O
arm O
- O
chair O
, O
watching O
her O
silently O
. O
Her O
old O
irritation O
of O
temper O
and O
manner O
seemed O
|
     | O
to O
have O
suddenly O
disappeared O
, O
or O
perhaps O
she O
was O
too O
depressed O
in O
body O
and O
mind O
to O
show O
it O
. O
| 
  | O
Mary B-PERSON
told O
her O
all O
that O
had O
been O
done O
with O
regard O
to O
Mr. O
Bridgenorth B-PERSON
  O
all O
her O
own O
plans O
for O
|
     | O
seeking O
out O
Will O
  O
all O
her O
hopes O
  O
and O
concealed O
as O
well O
as O
she O
could O
all O
the O
doubts O
and O
fears O
|
     | O
that O
would O
arise O
unbidden O
. O
To O
this O
Mrs. O
Wilson B-PERSON
listened O
without O
much O
remark O
, O
but O
with O
deep O
|
     | O
interest O
and O
perfect O
comprehension O
. O
When O
Mary B-PERSON
ceased O
she O
sighed O
and O
said O
, O
" O
Oh O
wench O
! O
I O
am O
his O
|
     | O
mother O
, O
and O
yet O
I O
do O
so O
little O
, O
I O
can O
do O
so O
little O
! O
That O
's O
what O
frets O
me O
! O
I O
seem O
like O
a O
child O
|
     | O
as O
sees O
its O
mammy O
ill O
, O
and O
moans B-NORP
and O
cries O
its O
little O
heart O
out O
, O
yet O
does O
nought O
to O
help O
. O
I O
|
     | O
think O
my O
sense O
has O
left O
me O
all O
at O
once O
, O
and O
I O
ca O
n't O
even O
find O
strength O
to O
cry O
like O
the O
little O
|
     | O
child O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Hereupon B-NORP
she O
broke O
into O
a O
feeble O
wail O
of O
self O
- O
reproach O
, O
that O
her O
outward O
show O
of O
misery O
was O
|
     | O
not O
greater O
  O
as O
if O
any O
cries O
, O
or O
tears O
, O
or O
loud O
- O
spoken O
words O
could O
have O
told O
of O
such O
pangs O
at O
|
     | O
the O
heart O
as O
that O
look O
, O
and O
that O
thin O
, O
piping O
, O
altered O
voice O
! O
| 
  | O
But O
think O
of O
Mary B-PERSON
and O
what O
she O
was O
enduring O
! O
Picture O
to O
yourself O
( O
for O
I O
can O
not O
tell O
you O
) O
the O
|
     | O
armies O
of O
thoughts O
that O
met O
and O
clashed O
in O
her O
brain O
  O
and O
then O
imagine O
the O
effort O
it O
cost O
her O
|
     | O
to O
be O
calm O
, O
and O
quiet O
, O
and O
even O
, O
in O
a O
faint O
way O
, O
cheerful O
and O
smiling O
at O
times O
. O
| 
  | O
After O
a O
while O
she O
began O
to O
stir O
about O
in O
her O
own O
mind O
for O
some O
means O
of O
sparing O
the O
poor O
|
     | O
mother O
the O
trial O
of O
appearing O
as O
a O
witness O
in O
the O
matter O
of O
the O
gun O
. O
She O
had O
made O
no O
allusion O
|
     | O
to O
her O
summons O
this B-TIME
morning I-TIME
, O
and O
Mary B-PERSON
almost O
thought O
she O
must O
have O
forgotten O
it O
  O
and O
surely O
|
     | O
some O
means O
might O
be O
found O
to O
prevent O
that O
additional O
sorrow O
. O
She O
must O
see O
Job B-PERSON
about O
it O
  O
nay O
, O
if O
|
     | O
necessary O
, O
she O
must O
see O
Mr. O
Bridgenorth B-PERSON
, O
with O
all O
his O
truth O
- O
compelling O
powers O
  O
for O
, O
indeed O
, O
she O
|
     | O
had O
so O
struggled O
and O
triumphed O
( O
though O
a O
sadly O
- O
bleeding O
victor O
at O
heart O
) O
over O
herself O
these O
two B-DATE
|
     | I-DATE
last I-DATE
days I-DATE
, O
had O
so O
concealed O
agony O
, O
and O
hidden O
her O
inward O
woe O
and O
bewilderment O
, O
that O
she O
began O
|
     | O
to O
take O
confidence O
, O
and O
to O
have O
faith O
in O
her O
own O
powers O
of O
meeting O
any O
one O
with O
a O
passably O
fair O
|
     | O
show O
, O
whatever O
might O
be O
rending O
her O
life O
beneath O
the O
cloak O
of O
her O
deception O
. O
| 
  | O
Accordingly O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
Mrs. O
Davenport B-PERSON
came O
in O
after O
morning B-TIME
church O
, O
to O
ask O
after O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
|
     | O
lone O
women O
, O
and O
she O
had O
heard O
the O
report O
Mary B-PERSON
had O
to O
give O
( O
so O
much O
better O
as O
regarded O
Mrs. O
|
     | O
Wilson B-ORG
than O
what O
they O
had O
feared O
the O
night O
before O
it O
would O
have O
been)—as O
soon O
as O
this O
|
     | O
kind O
- O
hearted O
, O
grateful O
woman O
came O
in O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
telling O
her O
her O
purpose O
, O
went O
off O
to O
fetch O
the O
|
     | O
doctor O
who O
attended O
Alice B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
He O
was O
shaking O
himself O
after O
his O
morning B-TIME
's O
round O
, O
and O
happy O
in O
the O
anticipation O
of O
his O
|
     | O
Sunday B-DATE
's O
dinner O
  O
but O
he O
was O
a O
good O
- O
tempered O
man O
, O
who O
found O
it O
difficult O
to O
keep O
down O
his O
jovial O
|
     | O
easiness O
even O
by O
the O
bed O
of O
sickness O
or O
death O
. O
He O
had O
mischosen O
his O
profession O
  O
for O
it O
was O
his O
|
     | O
delight O
to O
see O
every O
one O
around O
him O
in O
full O
enjoyment O
of O
life O
. O
| 
  | O
However O
, O
he O
subdued O
his O
face O
to O
the O
proper O
expression O
of O
sympathy O
, O
befitting O
a O
doctor O
|
     | O
listening O
to O
a O
patient O
, O
or O
a O
patient O
's O
friend O
( O
and O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
sad O
, O
pale O
, O
anxious O
face O
might O
be O
|
     | O
taken O
for O
either O
the O
one B-CARDINAL
or O
the O
other O
) O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Well O
, O
my O
girl O
! O
and O
what O
brings O
you O
here O
? O
" O
said O
he O
, O
as O
he O
entered O
his O
surgery O
. O
" O
Not O
on O
your O
|
     | O
own O
account O
, O
I O
hope O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
wanted O
you O
to O
come O
and O
see O
Alice B-PERSON
Wilson,—and O
then O
I O
thought O
you O
would O
may O
be O
take O
a O
look O
|
     | O
at O
Mrs. O
Wilson B-PERSON
. O
" O
| 
  | O
He O
bustled O
on O
his O
hat O
and O
coat O
, O
and O
followed O
Mary B-PERSON
instantly O
. O
| 
  | O
After O
shaking O
his O
head O
over O
Alice B-PERSON
( O
as O
if O
it O
was O
a O
mournful O
thing O
for O
one O
so O
pure O
and O
good O
, O
so O

     | O
true O
, O
although O
so O
humble O
a O
Christian B-NORP
, O
to O
be O
nearing O
her O
desired O
haven O
) O
, O
and O
muttering O
the O
|
     | O
accustomed O
words O
intended O
to O
destroy O
hope O
, O
and O
prepare O
anticipation O
, O
he O
went O
in O
compliance O
with O
|
     | O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
look O
to O
ask O
the O
usual O
questions O
of O
Mrs. O
Wilson B-PERSON
, O
who O
sat O
passively O
in O
her O
arm O
- O
chair O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
answered O
his O
questions O
, O
and O
submitted O
to O
his O
examination O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
How O
do O
you O
think O
her O
? O
" O
asked O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
eagerly O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Why O
— O
a O
, O
" O
began O
he O
, O
perceiving O
that O
he O
was O
desired O
to O
take O
one O
side O
in O
his O
answer O
, O
and O
unable O
|
     | O
to O
find O
out O
whether O
his O
listener O
was O
anxious O
for O
a O
favourable O
verdict O
or O
otherwise O
  O
but O
|
     | O
thinking O
it O
most O
probable O
that O
she O
would O
desire O
the O
former O
, O
he O
continued O
, O
| 
  | O
" O
She O
is O
weak O

certainly O

natural O
result O
of O
such O
a O
shock O
as O
the O
arrest O
of O
her O
son O
would O
|
     | O
be,—for O
I O
understand O
this O
James B-PERSON
Wilson I-PERSON
, O
who O
murdered O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON
, O
was O
her O
son O

thing O
to O
have O

such O
a O
reprobate O
in O

indignantly O

up O
on O

still O

the O

tone O

one O

wish,—"Why O

you O

So O
she O
sat O
quiet O

still O

an O

  O
sitting O

She O
was O
really O
curious O
to O
see O
Mary B-PERSON
  O
her O
connexion O
with O
a O

seemed O
to O

Well O
now O

" O
How O
dare O
you O

asked O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
firing O
up O
from O
the O
state O
of O
languid O

     | O
indifference O
into O
which O
she O
had O
sunk O

Sally B-PERSON
had O
been O
settling O
about O
her O
dress O
. O
" O
But O
it O

no O
matter O
what O
you O
think O
as O
did O
not O
know O

What O
grieves O
me O
is O
, O
that O
people O
should O
go O
on O

     | O
thinking O
him O
guilty O
as O
did O
know O

she O

sinking O
back O
into O
her O
former O
depressed O
tone O

     | O
manner O

" O
And O
do O

you O
think O
he O
did O
it O

asked O
Sally B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
Mary B-PERSON
paused O
  O
she O
was O
going O
on O
too O
fast O
with O
one O
so O
curious O
and O
so O
unscrupulous O
. O
Besides O
she O
|
     | O
remembered O
how O
even O
she O
herself O
had O
, O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
believed O
him O
guilty O
  O
and O
she O
felt O
it O
was O
not O
for O
|
     | O
her O
to O
cast O
stones O
at O
those O
who O
, O
on O
similar O
evidence O
, O
inclined O
to O
the O
same O
belief O
. O
None O
had O
|
     | O
given O
him O
much O
benefit O
of O
a O
doubt O
. O
None O
had O
faith O
in O
his O
innocence O
. O
None O
but O
his O
mother O
  O
and O
|
     | O
there O
the O
heart O
loved O
more O
than O
the O
head O
reasoned O
, O
and O
her O
yearning O
affection O
had O
never O
for O
an O
|
     | O
instant O
entertained O
the O
idea O
that O
her O
Jem B-PERSON
was O
a O
murderer O
. O
But O
Mary B-PERSON
disliked O
the O
whole O
|
     | O
conversation O
  O
the O
subject O
, O
the O
manner O
in O
which O
it O
was O
treated O
, O
were O
all O
painful O
, O
and O
she O
had O
a O
|
     | O
repugnance O
to O
the O
person O
with O
whom O
she O
spoke O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
was O
thankful O
, O
therefore O
, O
when O
Job B-PERSON
Legh I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
voice O
was O
heard O
at O
the O
door O
, O
as O
he O
stood O
with O

     | O
the O
latch O
in O
his O
hand O
, O
talking O
to O
a O
neighbour O
, O
and O
when O
Sally B-PERSON
jumped O
up O
in O
vexation O
and O
said O
, O

     | O
" O
There O

" O

So O
far O
in O
a O

louder O
, O

" O

you O

  | O
She O
and O
Job O
passed O
each O
other O
at O
the O
door O
, O
with O
mutual O
looks O
of O
dislike O
, O
which O
neither O
took O

any O

" O

honourable O

a O

had O
only O
that O

     | O
instant O
crossed O
her O

apparent O

Job O

contempt O

     | O
the O
state O
she O
is O
till O
then O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
was O
sure O
you O
would O
think O
so O
, O
" O
said O
Mary B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
But O
they O
were O
reckoning O
without O
their O
host O
. O
They O
esteemed O
her O
senses O
gone O
, O
while O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
|
     | O
they O
were O
only O
inert O
, O
and O
could O
not O
convey O
impressions O
rapidly O
to O
the O
over O
- O
burdened O
, O
troubled O
|
     | O
brain O
. O
They O
had O
not O
noticed O
that O
her O
eyes O
had O
followed O
them O
( O
mechanically O
it O
seemed O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
) O
|
     | O
as O
they O
had O
moved O
away O
to O
the O
corner O
of O
the O
room O
  O
that O
her O
face O
, O
hitherto O
so O
changeless O
, O
had O
|
     | O
begun O
to O
work O
with O
one B-CARDINAL
or O
two B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
old O
symptoms O
of O
impatience O
. O
| 
  | O
But O
when O
they O
were O
silent O
she O
stood O
up O
, O
and O
startled O
them O
almost O
as O
if O
a O
dead O
person O
had O
|
     | O
spoken O
, O
by O
saying O
clearly O
and O
decidedly—"I O
go O
to O
Liverpool B-GPE
. O
I O
hear O
you O
and O
your O
plans O
  O
and O
I O

     | O
tell O
you O
I O
shall O
go O
to O
Liverpool B-GPE
. O
If O
my O
words O
are O
to O
kill O
my O
son O
, O
they O
have O
already O
gone O
forth O

     | O
out O
of O
my O
mouth O
, O
and O
nought O
can O
bring O
them O
back O
. O
But O
I O
will O
have O
faith O
. O
Alice B-PERSON
( O
up O
above O
) O
has O
|
     | O
often O
telled O
me O
I O
wanted O
faith O
, O
and O
now O
I O
will O
have O
it O
. O
They O
cannot O
— O
they O
will O
not O
kill O
my O

     | O
child O
, O
my O
only O
child O
. O
I O
will O
not O
be O
afeared O
. O
Yet O
, O
oh O
! O
I O
am O
so O
sick O
with O
terror O
. O
But O
if O
he O
is O
to O
|
     | O
die O
, O
think O
ye O
not O
that O
I O
will O
see O
him O
again O
  O
ay O
! O
see O
him O
at O
his O
trial O
? O
When O
all O
are O
hating O
him O
, O
|
     | O
he O
shall O
have O
his O
poor O
mother O
near O
him O
, O
to O
give O
him O
all O
the O
comfort O
, O
eyes O
, O
and O
looks O
, O
and O

     | O
tears O
, O
and O
a O
heart O
that O
is O
dead O
to O
all O
but O
him O
, O
can O
give O
  O
his O
poor O
old O
mother O
, O
who O
knows O
how O

     | O
free O
he O
is O
from O
sin O
— O
in O
the O
sight O
of O
man O
at O

. O
They O
'll O
let O
me O
go O
to O
him O
, O
maybe O
, O
the O
very O
|
     | O
minute O
it O
's O
over O
  O
and O
I O
know O
many O
Scripture O
texts O
( O
though O
you O
would O
not O
think O
it O
) O
, O
that O
may O
|
     | O
keep O
up O
his O
heart O
. O
I O
missed O
seeing O
him O
ere O
he O
went O
to O
yon O
prison O
, O
but O
nought O
shall O
keep O
me O
away O
|
     | O
again O
one B-TIME
minute I-TIME
when O
I O
can O
see O
his O
face O
  O
for O
maybe O
the O
minutes O
are O
numbered O
, O
and O
the O
count O
but O

     | O
small O
. O
I O
know O
I O
can O
be O
a O
comfort O
to O
him O
, O
poor O
lad O
. O
You O
would O
not O
think O
it O
, O
now O
, O
but O
he O
'd O
alway O

     | O
speak O
as O
kind O
and O
soft O
to O
me O
as O
if O
he O
were O
courting O
me O
, O
like O
. O
He O
loved O
me O
above O
a O
bit O
  O
and O
am O
I O

     | O
to O
leave O
him O
now O
to O
dree O
all O
the O
cruel O
slander O
they O
'll O
put O
upon O
him O
? O
I O
can O
pray O
for O
him O
at O
each O

     | O
hard O
word O
they O
say O
against O
him O
, O
if O
I O
can O
do O
nought O
else O
  O
and O
he O
'll O
know O
what O
his O
mother O
is O

     | O
doing O
for O
him O
, O
poor O
lad O
, O
by O
the O
look O
on O
my O
face O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Still O
they O
made O
some O
look O
, O
or O
gesture O
of O
opposition O
to O
her O
wishes O
. O
She O
turned O
sharp O
round O
on O

     | O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
the O
old O
object O
of O
her O
pettish O
attacks O
, O
and O
said O
, O

  | O
" O

could O
never O

aching O

" O

She O
sank O
back O
in O
her O
chair O
, O
quite O
exhausted O
by O
the O
sudden O
effort O
she O
had O
made O
  O
but O
if O
they O

     | O
even O
offered O
to O
speak O
, O
she O
cut O
them O
short O
( O
whatever O

with O
the O
repetition O

" O
| 
  | O
Now O
Mary B-PERSON
disliked O
this O
plan O
inexpressibly O
  O
her O
dislike O
was O
partly O
grounded O
on O
reason O

     | O
partly O
on O

necessary O
to O

taken O

perseverance O

desperation O
enough O
to O
follow O
out O
the O
slightest O
chance O
  O

her O
love O
would O

     | O
endow O
her O
with O
all O

qualities O

alternative O

awaited O
her O

     | O
in O
case O
all O
failed O
and O
Jem B-PERSON

No O
one O
could O
have O
her O
motives O

no O

Besides O
( O
only O

So O
with O
vehemence O

she O
rebutted O

     | O
told O

But O
no O
words O
would O
come O

Mary B-PERSON
's O
voice O
seemed O
choked O
up O
in O
her O
throat O

" O

what O
do O
you O
want O

" O
No O

replied O
Mrs. O
Jones B-PERSON
, O
inclining O
to O
shut O
the O
door O
in O
her O
face O
. O

" O

asked O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
sickening O
. O

" O
He O

And O
again O
the O
door O
seemed O
closing O

  | O
But O
Mary B-PERSON
bent O
forwards O
with O
suppliant O
action O
( O
as O
some O
young O
tree O
bends O
, O
when O
blown O
by O
the O

rough O

autumnal O

out O

  | O
Mrs. O

suspected O
some O
love O
affair O
, O
and O
, O
perhaps O
, O
one O
of O
not O
the O
most O
creditable O

  O
but O
|
     | O
the O
distress O
of O
the O
pale O
young O

before O

was O
so O
obvious O

so O
pitiable O

Mrs. O

no O

hold O
up O

" O
asked O
Mary B-PERSON

to O

all O
this O
explanation O
had O
been O
a O
vague O
mystery O

" O
Do O

said O
the O
boy O

must O
get O
a O

It O
's O
just O
a O
chance O

heavy O

that O

Mary B-PERSON
had O
humbly O

eagerly O
( O
oh O

listened O

this O
young O
Sir O

pleased O

her O

glanced O
over O

up O

Mary B-PERSON
assented O
quietly O
to O
this O

in O

her O
heart O
was O
sinking O
within O
her O

she O
no O

Her O
bodily O

was O
giving O

stood O

beat O
down O

said O
Charley B-PERSON
  O
and O
altering O
his O
manner O
from O
the O
patronising O
key O
in O
which O

     | O
he O
had O
spoken O
to O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
he O
addressed O
a O
weather O

beaten O
old O
sailor O

came O
rolling O
along O
the O

     | O
pathway O

they O
stood O
, O
his O
hands O
in O

his O
quid O
in O
his O
mouth O
, O
with O
very O
much O

     | O
the O
air O
of O
one O
who O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O

look O
about O
him O
, O
and O
spit O
right O

left O
  O
addressing O

     | O
this O
old O
tar O
, O
Charley B-PERSON
made O
known O
to O
him O
his O
wish O
in O
slang O
, O
which O
to O
Mary B-PERSON
was O
almost O
inaudible O
, O

     | O
and O
quite O
unintelligible O
, O
and O
which O
I O
am O
too O
much O
of O
a O
land O
- O
lubber O
to O
repeat O
correctly O
. O
| 
  | O
Mary B-PERSON
watched O
looks O
and O
actions O
with O
a O
renovated O
keenness O
of O
perception O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
saw O
the O
old O
man O
listen O
attentively O
to O
Charley B-PERSON

she O
saw O
him O
eye O
her O
over O
from O

foot O
, O
and O
wind O
up O
his O
inspection O
with O
a O
little O
nod O
of O
approbation O
( O
for O
her O
very O
shabbiness O
and O
|
     | O
poverty O
of O
dress O
were O
creditable O
signs O
to O
the O
experienced O
old O
sailor O
) O
  O
and O
then O
she O
watched O
him O

     | O
leisurely O
swing O
himself O
on O
to O
a O
ship O
in O
the O
basin O
, O
and O
, O
borrowing O
a O
glass O
, O
run O
up O
the O
mast O
with O

     | O
the O
speed O
of O
a O
monkey O

" O

she O

in O
affright O

clutching O
at O

marked O
face O

up O

down O

absence O
, O
as O
they O
pushed O
off O
from O
the O
landing O
- O
place O
, O
and O
|
     | O
remembered O
that O
she O
had O
never O
thanked O
him O
for O
all O
his O
kind O
interest O
in O
her O
behalf O
  O
and O
now O
his O
|
     | O
absence O
made O
her O
feel O
most O
lonely O
— O
even O
his O
, O
the O
little O
mushroom O
friend O
of O
an O
hour B-TIME

The O
boat O
threaded O
her O
way O
through O
the O
maze O
of O
larger O
vessels O
which O
surrounded O
the O
shore O
, O
|
     | O
bumping O
against O
one O
, O
kept O
off O
by O
the O
oars O
from O
going O
right O
against O
another O
, O
overshadowed O
by O
a O
|
     | O
third B-ORDINAL
, O
until O
at O
length O
they O
were O
fairly O
out O
on O
the O
broad O
river O
, O
away O
from O
either O
shore O
  O
the O
|
     | O
sights O
and O
sounds O
of O
land O
being O
lost O
in O
the O
distance O
. O
| 
  | O
And O
then O
came O
a O
sort O
of O
pause O
. O
| 
  | O
Both O
wind O
and O
tide O
were O
against O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
men O
, O
and O
labour O
as O
they O
would O
they O
made O
but O
little O
|
     | O
way O
. O
Once O
Mary O
in O
her O
impatience O
had O
risen O
up O
to O
obtain O
a O
better O
view O
of O
the O
progress O
they O
had O
|
     | O
made O
, O
but O
the O
men O
had O
roughly O
told O
her O
to O
sit O
down O
immediately O
, O
and O
she O
had O
dropped O
on O
her O
seat O
|
     | O
like O
a O
chidden O
child O
, O
although O
the O
impatience O
was O
still O
at O
her O
heart O
. O
| 
  | O
But O
now O
she O
grew O
sure O
they O
were O
turning O
off O
from O
the O
straight O
course O
which O
they O
had O
hitherto O
|
     | O
kept O
on O
the O
Cheshire B-PERSON
side O
of O
the O
river O
, O
whither O
they O
had O
gone O
to O
avoid O
the O
force O
of O
the O
|
     | O
current O
, O
and O
after O
a O
short O
time O
she O
could O
not O
help O
naming O
her O
conviction O
, O
as O
a O
kind O
of O
|
     | O
nightmare O
dread O
and O
belief O
came O
over O
her O
, O
that O
every O
thing O
animate O
and O
inanimate O
was O
in O
league O
|
     | O
against O
her O
one O
sole O
aim O
and O
object O
of O
overtaking O
Will O
. O
| 
  | O
They O
answered O
gruffly O
. O
They O
saw O
a O
boatman O
whom O
they O
knew O
, O
and O
were O
desirous O
of O
obtaining O
his O
|
     | O
services O
as O
steersman O
, O
so O
that O
both O
might O
row O
with O
greater O
effect O
. O
They O
knew O
what O
they O
were O
|
     | O
about O
. O
So O
she O
sat O
silent O
with O
clenched O
hands O
while O
the O
parley O
went O
on O
, O
the O
explanation O
was O
|
     | O
given O
, O
the O
favour O
asked O
and O
granted O
. O
But O
she O
was O
sickening O
all O
the O
time O
with O
nervous O
fear O
. O
| 
  | O
They O
had O
been O
rowing O
a O
long O
, O
long O
time O
— O
half B-CARDINAL
a O
day O
it O
seemed O
, O
at O
least O
— O
yet O
Liverpool B-ORG
appeared O
|
     | O
still O
close O
at O
hand O
, O
and O
Mary B-PERSON
began O
almost O
to O
wonder O
that O
the O
men O
were O
not O
as O
much O
disheartened O
|
     | O
as O
she O
was O
, O
when O
the O
wind O
, O
which O
had O
been O
hitherto O
against O
them O
, O
dropped O
, O
and O
thin O
clouds O
began O
|
     | O
to O
gather O
over O
the O
sky O
, O
shutting O
out O
the O
sun O
, O
and O
casting O
a O
chilly O
gloom O
over O
every O
thing O
. O
| 
  | O
There O
was O
not O
a O
breath O
of O
air O
, O
and O
yet O
it O
was O
colder O
than O
when O
the O
soft O
violence O
of O
the O
|
     | O
westerly O
wind O
had O
been O
felt O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
men O
renewed O
their O
efforts O
. O
The O
boat O
gave O
a O
bound O
forwards O
at O
every O
pull O
of O
the O
oars O
. O
The O
|
     | O
water O
was O
glassy O
and O
motionless O
, O
reflecting O
tint O
by O
tint O
of O
the O
Indian B-NORP
- O
ink O
sky O
above O
. O
Mary B-PERSON
|
     | I-PERSON
shivered O
, O
and O
her O
heart O
sank O
within O
her O
. O
Still O
now O
they O
evidently O
were O
making O
progress O
. O
Then O
|
     | O
the O
steersman O
pointed O
to O
a O
rippling O
line O
in O
the O
river O
only O
a O
little O
way O
off O
, O
and O
the O
men O
|
     | O
disturbed O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
watching O
the O
ships O
that O
lay O
in O
what O
appeared O
to O
her O
the O
open O
sea O
, O
to O

     | O
get O
at O
their O
sails O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
gave O
a O
little O
start O
, O
and O
rose O
. O
Her O
patience O
, O
her O
grief O
, O
and O
perhaps O
her O
silence O
, O
had O
|
     | O
begun O
to O
win O
upon O
the O
men O
. O
| 
  | O
" O

" O
| 
  | O
He O
had O
forgotten O
( O
or O
perhaps O
he O
did O
not O
like O
to O
remind O
Mary B-PERSON
) O
that O
the O
same O
wind O
which O
now O

     | O
bore O
their O
little O
craft O
along O
with O
easy O

motion O

would O
also O

  | O
But O
as O
they O
looked O
with O
straining O
eyes O
, O
as O
if O
to O
measure O
the O
decreasing O
distance O
that O
|
     | O
separated O
them O
from O
her O
, O
they O
saw O
her O
sails O
unfurled O
and O
flap O
in O
the O
breeze O
, O
till O
, O
catching O
the O

     | O
right O
point O
, O
they O
bellied O
forth O
into O
white O
roundness O
, O
and O
the O
ship O
began O
to O
plunge O
and O
heave O
, O
|
     | O
as O
if O
she O
were O
a O
living O
creature O
, O
impatient O
to O
be O
off O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
They O

heaving O
anchor O

" O
said O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
boatmen O
to O
the O
others O
, O
as O
the O
faint O
musical O
cry O
of O
|
     | O
the O
sailors O
came O
floating O
over O
the O
waters O
that O
still O
separated O
them O
. O
| 
  | O
Full O
of O
the O
spirit O
of O
the O
chase O
, O
though O
as O
yet O
ignorant O
of O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
motives O
, O
the O
men O
sprang O
to O
|
     | O
hoist O
another O
sail O
. O
It O
was O
fully O
as O
much O
as O
the O
boat O
could O
bear O
, O
in O
the O
keen O
, O
gusty O
east O
wind O
|
     | O
which O
was O
now O
blowing O
, O
and O
she O
bent O
, O
and O
laboured O
, O
and O
ploughed O
, O
and O
creaked O
upbraidingly O
as O
if O

     | O
tasked O
beyond O
her O
strength O
  O
but O
she O
sped O
along O
with O
a O
gallant O
swiftness O
. O

They O
drew O
nearer O
, O
and O
they O
heard O
the O
distant O
" O
ahoy O
" O
more O
clearly O
. O
It O
ceased O

The O
anchor O
was O

     | O
up O

the O
ship O
was O
away O

  | O
Mary B-PERSON
stood O
up O

steadying O
herself O
by O
the O
mast O

stretched O
out O
her O
arms O

imploring O
the O

flying O
vessel O
to O
stay O
its O
course O
by O
that O
mute O

the O
tears O
streamed O
down O
her O
cheeks O

     | O
The O
men O
caught O
up O
their O
oars O

hoisted O
them O
in O
the O
air O

shouted O
to O
arrest O
attention O

were O
seen O
by O
the O

aboard O
the O
larger O
craft O
  O

they O
were O
too O
busy O
with O
all O
the O

     | O
confusion O
prevalent O
in O
an O
outward O

to O
pay O

seamen O

the O

rather O

oh O
! O
and O
alas O
! O
they O
heard O
his O
|
     | O
words O
. O
| 
  | O
He O
swore O
a O
dreadful O
oath O
  O
he O
called O
Mary B-PERSON
a O
disgraceful O
name O
  O
and O
he O
said O
he O
would O
not O
stop O
|
     | O
his O
ship O
for O
any O
one O
, O
nor O
could O
he O
part O
with O
a O
single O
hand O
, O
whoever O
swung O
for O
it O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
words O
came O
in O
unpitying O
clearness O
with O
their O
trumpet O
- O
sound O
. O
Mary B-PERSON
sat O
down O
, O
looking O
like O
|
     | O
one O
who O
prays O
in O
the O
death O
- O
agony O
. O
For O
her O
eyes O
were O
turned O
up O
to O
that O
Heaven O
, O
where O
mercy O
|
     | O
dwelleth O
, O
while O
her O
blue O
lips O
quivered O
, O
though O
no O
sound O
came O
. O
Then O
she O
bowed O
her O
head O
and O
hid O
|
     | O
it O
in O
her O
hands O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Hark O
! O
yon O
sailor O
hails O
us O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
She O
looked O
up O
. O
And O
her O
heart O
stopped O
its O
beating O
to O
listen O
. O
| 
  | O
William B-PERSON
Wilson I-PERSON
stood O
as O
near O
the O
stern O
of O
the O
vessel O
as O
he O
could O
get O
  O
and O
unable O
to O
obtain O
|
     | O
the O
trumpet O
from O
the O
angry O
captain O
, O
made O
a O
tube O
of O
his O
own O
hands O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
So O
help O
me O
God O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
Barton I-PERSON
, O
I O
'll O
come O
back O
in O
the O
pilot O
- O
boat O
, O
time O
enough O
to O
save O
the O
life O
|
     | O
of O
the O
innocent O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
What O
does O
he O
say O
? O
" O
asked O
Mary B-PERSON
wildly O
, O
as O
the O
voice O
died O
away O
in O
the O
increasing O
distance O
, O
|
     | O
while O
the O
boatmen O
cheered O
, O
in O
their O
kindled O
sympathy O
with O
their O
passenger O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
What O
does O
he O
say O
? O
" O
repeated O
she O
. O
" O
Tell O
me O
. O
I O
could O
not O
hear O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
She O
had O
heard O
with O
her O
ears O
, O
but O
her O
brain O
refused O
to O
recognise O
the O
sense O
. O
| 
  | O
They O
repeated O
his O
speech O
, O
all O
three B-CARDINAL
speaking O
at O
once O
, O
with O
many O
comments O
  O
while O
Mary B-PERSON
looked O
|
     | O
at O
them O
and O
then O
at O
the O
vessel O
now O
far O
away O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
do O
n't O
rightly O
know O
about O
it O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
sorrowfully O
. O
" O
What O
is O
the O
pilot O
- O
boat O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
They O
told O
her O
, O
and O
she O
gathered O
the O
meaning O
out O
of O
the O
sailors O
' O
slang O
which O
enveloped O
it O
. O
|
     | O
There O
was O
a O
hope O
still O
, O
although O
so O
slight O
and O
faint O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
How O
far O
does O
the O
pilot O
go O
with O
the O
ship O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
To O
different O
distances O
they O
said O
. O
Some O
pilots O
would O
go O
as O
far O
as O
Holyhead B-GPE
for O
the O
chance O
of O
|
     | O
the O
homeward O
- O
bound O
vessels O
  O
others O
only O
took O
the O
ships O
over O
the O
Banks O
. O
Some O
captains O
were O
more O
|
     | O
cautious O
than O
others O
, O
and O
the O
pilots O
had O
different O
ways O
. O
The O
wind O
was O
against O
the O
homeward O
|
     | O
bound O
vessels O
, O
so O
perhaps O
the O
pilot O
aboard O
the O
|  | O
John B-PERSON
Cropper I-PERSON
|  | O
would O
not O
care O
to O
go O
far O
|
     | O
out O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
How O
soon O
would O
he O
come O
back O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
There O
were O
three B-CARDINAL
boatmen O
, O
and O
three B-CARDINAL
opinions O
, O
varying O
from O
twelve B-TIME
hours I-TIME
to I-TIME
two B-DATE
days I-DATE
. O
Nay O
, O
the O
|
     | O
man O
who O
gave O
his O
vote O
for O
the O
longest O
time O
, O
on O
having O
his O
judgment O
disputed O
, O
grew O
stubborn O
, O
and O
|
     | O
doubled O
the O
time O
, O
and O
thought O
it O
might O
be O
the B-DATE
end I-DATE
of I-DATE
the I-DATE
week I-DATE
before O
the O
pilot O
- O
boat O
came O
|
     | O
home O
. O
| 
  | O
They O
began O
disputing O
, O
and O
urging O
reasons O
  O
and O
Mary B-PERSON
tried O
to O
understand O
them O
  O
but O
|
     | O
independently O
of O
their O
nautical O
language O
, O
a O
veil O
seemed O
drawn O
over O
her O
mind O
, O
and O
she O
had O
no O
|
     | O
clear O
perception O
of O
any O
thing O
that O
passed O
. O
Her O
very O
words O
seemed O
not O
her O
own O
, O
and O
beyond O
her O
|
     | O
power O
of O
control O
, O
for O
she O
found O
herself O
speaking O
quite O
differently O
to O
what O
she O
meant O
. O
| 
  | O
One B-CARDINAL
by O
one B-CARDINAL
her O
hopes O
had O
fallen O
away O
, O
and O
left O
her O
desolate O
  O
and O
though O
a O
chance O
yet O
|
     | O
remained O
, O
she O
could O
no O
longer O
hope O
. O
She O
felt O
certain O
it O
, O
too O
, O
would O
fade O
and O
vanish O
. O
She O
sank O
|
     | O
into O
a O
kind O
of O
stupor O
. O
All O
outward O
objects O
harmonised O
with O
her O
despair O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
gloomy O
leaden O
sky,—the O
deep O
, O
dark O
waters O
below O
, O
of O
a O
still O
heavier O
shade O
of O
colour,—the O
|
     | O
cold O
, O
flat O
yellow O
shore O
in O
the O
distance O
, O
which O
no O
ray O
lightened O
up,—the O
nipping O
, O
cutting O
|
     | O
wind O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
shivered O
with O
her O
depression O
of O
mind O
and O
body O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
sails O
were O
taken O
down O
, O
of O
course O
, O
on O
the O
return O
to O
Liverpool B-GPE
, O
and O
the O
progress O
they O
made O
, O
|
     | O
rowing O
and O
tacking O
, O
was O
very O
slow O
. O
The O
men O
talked O
together O
, O
disputing O
about O
the O
pilots O
at O
|
     | O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
and O
then O
about O
matters O
of O
local O
importance O
, O
in O
which O
Mary B-PERSON
would O
have O
taken O
no O
interest O
|
     | O
at O
any O
time O
, O
and O
she O
gradually O
became O
drowsy O
  O
irrepressibly O
so O
, O
indeed O
, O
for O
in O
spite O
of O
her O
|
     | O
jerking O
efforts O
to O
keep O
awake O
she O
sank O
away O
to O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
boat O
, O
and O
there O
lay O
couched O
on O
|
     | O
a O
rough O
heap O
of O
sails O
, O
rope O
, O
and O
tackle O
of O
various O
kinds O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
measured O
beat O
of O
the O
waters O
against O
the O
sides O
of O
the O
boat O
, O
and O
the O
musical O
boom O
of O
the O
|
     | O
more O
distant O
waves O
, O
were O
more O
lulling O
than O
silence O
, O
and O
she O
slept O
sound O
. O
| 
  | O
Once O
she O
opened O
her O
eyes O
heavily O
, O
and O
dimly O
saw O
the O
old O
gray O
, O
rough O
boatman B-PERSON
( O
who O
had O
stood O
|
     | O
out O
the O
most O
obstinately O
for O
the O
full O
fare O
) O
covering O
her O
with O
his O
thick O
pea O
- O
jacket O
. O
He O
had O
|
     | O
taken O
it O
off O
on O
purpose O
, O
and O
was O
doing O
it O
tenderly O
in O
his O
way O
, O
but O
before O
she O
could O
rouse O
|
     | O
herself O
up O
to O
thank O
him O
she O
had O
dropped O
off O
to O
sleep O
again O
. O
| 
  | O
At O
last O
, O
in O
the O
dusk O
of O
evening B-TIME
, O
they O
arrived O
at O
the O
landing O
- O
place O
from O
which O
they O
had O
|
     | O
started O
some B-TIME
hours I-TIME
before O
. O
The O
men O
spoke O
to O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
but O
though O
she O
mechanically O
replied O
, O
she O
did O
|
     | O
not O
stir O
  O
so O
, O
at O
length O
, O
they O
were O
obliged O
to O
shake O
her O
. O
She O
stood O
up O
, O
shivering O
and O
puzzled O
as O
|
     | O
to O
her O
whereabouts O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Now O
tell O
me O
where O
you O
are O
bound O
to O
, O
missis O
, O
" O
said O
the O
gray O
old O
man O
, O
" O
and O
maybe O
I O
can O
put O
you O
|
     | O
in O
the O
way O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
She O
slowly O
comprehended O
what O
he O
said O
, O
and O
went O
through O
the O
process O
of O
recollection O
  O
but O
very O
|
     | O
dimly O
, O
and O
with O
much O
labour O
. O
She O
put O
her O
hand O
into O
her O
pocket O
and O
pulled O
out O
her O
purse O
, O
and O
|
     | O
shook O
its O
contents O
into O
the O
man O
's O
hand O
  O
and O
then O
began O
meekly O
to O
unpin O
her O
shawl O
, O
although O
they O
|
     | O
had O
turned O
away O
without O
asking O
for O
it O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
No O
, O
no O
! O
" O
said O
the O
older O
man O
, O
who O
lingered O
on O
the O
step O
before O
springing O
into O
the O
boat O
, O
and O
to O
|
     | O
whom O
she O
mutely O
offered O
the O
shawl O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Keep O
it O
! O
we O
donnot O
want O
it O
. O
It O
were O
only O
for O
to O
try O
you,—some B-ORG
folks O
say O
they O
've O
no O
more O

     | O
blunt O
, O
when O
all O
the O
while O
they O

getten O
a O
mint O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Thank O
you O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
in O
a O
dull O
, O
low O
tone O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Where O
are O
you O
bound O
to O
? O
I O
axed O
that O
question O
afore O

" O
said O
the O
gruff O
old O
fellow O
. O

  | O
" O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O
I O
'm O
a O
stranger O
, O
" O
replied O
she O
, O
quietly O
, O
with O
a O
strange O
absence O
of O
anxiety O
under O
|
     | O
the O
circumstances O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
But O

" O
she O
answered O
, O
and O
the O
man O
, O
partly O
relieved O
, O
jumped O
|
     | O
into O
the O
boat O
, O
which O
was O
now O
pushing O
off O
to O
make O
way O
for O
the O
arrivals O
from O
some O
steamer O
. O
| 
  | O
Mary B-PERSON
felt O
in O
her O
pocket O
for O
the O
card O
, O
on O
which O
was O
written O
the O
name O

the O
street O
where O
she O

     | O
was O

at O
two B-TIME

  O
where O

where O

learnt O
from O
the O
former O
the O
particulars O

some O
respectable O

     | O
It O
was O
not O

| 
  | O
She O
tried O
to O
brighten O
her O
perceptions O
, O
and O
felt O
again O
, O
and O
took O
out O
the O
little O
articles O
her O

     | O
pocket O

her O
empty O

her O

such O

it O
was O

not O
there O

In O
fact O
she O

dropped O
it O

, O
so O
eager O
to O
embark O

she O

pulled O
out O
her O

She O
only O
knew O
it O
was O
gone O
. O
| 
  | O
It O
added O
but O
little O
to O
the O
despair O
that O
was O
creeping O
over O
her O
. O
But O
she O
tried O
a O
little O
more O
to O
|
     | O
help O
herself O
, O
though O
every B-TIME
minute I-TIME
her O
mind O
became O
more O
cloudy O
. O
She O
strove O
to O
remember O
where O
|
     | O
Will O
had O
lodged O
, O
but O
she O
could O
not O
  O
name O
, O
street O
, O
every O
thing O
had O
passed O
away O
, O
and O
it O
did O
not O
|
     | O
signify O
  O
better O
she O
were O
lost O
than O
found O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
sat O
down O
quietly O
on O
the O
top O
step O
of O
the O
landing O
, O
and O
gazed O
down O
into O
the O
dark O
, O
dank O
water O
|
     | O
below O
. O
Once O
or O
twice O
a O
spectral O
thought O
loomed O
among O
the O
shadows O
of O
her O
brain O
  O
a O
wonder O
whether O
|
     | O
beneath O
that O
cold O
dismal O
surface O
there O
would O
not O
be O
rest O
from O
the O
troubles O
of O
earth O
. O
But O
she O
|
     | O
could O
not O
hold O
an O
idea O
before O
her O
for O
two B-CARDINAL
consecutive O
moments O
  O
and O
she O
forgot O
what O
she O
thought O
|
     | O
about O
before O
she O
could O
act O
upon O
it O
. O
| 
  | O
So O
she O
continued O
sitting O
motionless O
, O
without O
looking O
up O
, O
or O
regarding O
in O
any O
way O
the O
insults O
|
     | O
to O
which O
she O
was O
subjected O
. O
| 
  | O
Through O
the O
darkening O
light O
the O
old O
boatman O
had O
watched O
her O
: O
interested O
in O
her O
in O
spite O
of O
|
     | O
himself O
, O
and O
his O
scoldings O
of O
himself O
. O
| 
  | O
When O
the O
landing O
- O
place O
was O
once O
more O
comparatively O
clear O
, O
he O
made O
his O
way O
towards O
it O
, O
across O
|
     | O
boats O
, O
and O
along O
planks O
, O
swearing O
at O
himself O
while O
he O
did O
so O
, O
for O
an O
old O
fool O
. O
| 
  | O
He O
shook O
Mary B-PERSON

violently O
. O
|

" O

" O

She O
looked O
again O
down O
upon O
the O
black O
mirror O
below O
. O
| 
  | O
He O
stood O
by O
her O
, O
striving O
to O
put O
down O
his O
better O
self O
  O
but O
he O
could O
not O
. O
He O
shook O
her O
again O
. O

     | O
She O
looked O
up O
, O
as O
if O
she O
had O
forgotten O
him O
. O

  | O
" O
What O

" O
asked O

wearily O

" O

replied O
he O
, O
clutching O
her O
arm O
to O
pull O
her O
up O
. O

  | O
She O
arose O

followed O

with O
the O
unquestioning O
docility O
of O

of O

" O

" O

down O
his O

to O
little O

     | O
purpose O
, O
I O
'm O
afraid O

He O
's O
very O
impracticable O
— O
very O
. O
I O
told O
him O
, O
of O

that O
he O
must O
be O

perfectly O

else O

the O
weak O
points O

I O
named O
your O
name O

     | O
with O
the O
view O
of O
unlocking O
his O
confidence O
, O

— O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
What O
did O
he O
say O

asked O
Job B-PERSON
, O
breathlessly O
. O

  | O
" O
Why O
, O
very O
little O
. O
He O
barely O
answered O
me O
. O
Indeed O
, O
he O
refused O
to O
answer O
some O

     | O
questions O
— O
positively O
refused O
. O
I O
do O

know O
what O
I O

you O

despondingly O
. O

  | O
" O
No O

I O
do O

" O
replied O
Mr. O
Bridgenorth B-PERSON
, O
quickly O

decisively O
. O
" O
Much O
less O
than O
I O
did O
before O

I O
saw O
him O

The O
impression O

only O
impression O

rely O

your O

it O

for O
fact)—the O
impression O

" O
with O
an O
emphasis O
on O
the O
word O
, O
" O
he O
gave O
me O
is O
, O
that O
he O
knows O

     | O
something O
about O
the O
affair O
, O
but O
what O
, O
he O
will O
not O
say O
  O
and O
so O
the O
chances O
are O
, O
if O
he O
persists O

     | O
in O
his O
obstinacy O

he O
'll O
be O
hung O

That O
's O
all O
. O
" O

  | O
He O
began O
to O
write O
again O
, O
for O
he O
had O
no O
time O
to O
lose O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
But O
he O
must O
not O
be O
hung O

" O
said O
Job B-PERSON
, O
with O
vehemence O
. O
| 
  | O
Mr. O
Bridgenorth B-PERSON
looked O
up O
, O
smiled O
a O
little O
, O
but O
shook O
his O
head O
. O

  | O
" O
What O
did O
he O
say O
, O
sir O

if O
I O
may O
be O
so O
bold O
as O
to O
ask O

" O
continued O
Job O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
His O
words O
were O
few O
enough O
, O
and O
he O
was O
so O
reserved O
and O
short O
, O
that O
as O
I O
said O
before O
, O
I O
can O
|
     | O
only O
give O
you O
the O
impression O
they O
conveyed O
to O
me O

I O
told O
him O
of O
course O
who O
I O
was O
, O

for O
what O

     | O
I O
was O
sent O

He O
looked O
pleased O

I O
thought,—at B-ORG
least O
his O
face O
( O
sad O
enough O
when O
I O
went O
in O
, O
I O
|
     | O
assure O
ye O
) O
brightened O
a O
little O
  O
but O
he O
said O
he O
had O
nothing O
to O
say O
, O
no O
defence O
to O
make O
. O
I O
asked O
|
     | O
him O
if O
he O
was O
guilty O
, O
then O
  O
and O
by O
way O
of O
opening O
his O
heart O
I O
said O
I O
understood O
he O
had O
had O
|
     | O
provocation O
enough O
, O
inasmuch O
as O
I O
heard O
that O
the O
girl O
was O
very O
lovely O
, O
and O
had O
jilted O
him O
to O

     | O
fall O
desperately O
in O
love O
with O
that O
handsome O
young O
Carson B-PERSON
( O
poor O
fellow O
! O
) O
. O
But O
James B-PERSON
Wilson I-PERSON
did O

     | O
not O
speak O
one B-CARDINAL
way O
or O
another O
. O
I O
then O
went O
to O
particulars O
. O
I O
asked O
him O
if O
the O
gun O
was O
his O
, O
as O
|
     | O
his O
mother O
had O
declared O
. O
He O
had O
not O
heard O
of O
her O
admission O
it O
was O
evident O
, O
from O
his O
quick O
way O
|
     | O
of O
looking O
up O
, O
and O
the O
glance O
of O
his O
eye O
  O
but O
when O
he O
saw O
I O
was O
observing O
him O
, O
he O
hung O
down O
his O
|
     | O
head O
again O
, O
and O
merely O
said O
she O
was O
right O
  O
it O
was O
his O
gun O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Well O

said O
Job B-PERSON
, O
impatiently O
, O
as O
Mr. O
Bridgenorth B-PERSON
paused O
. O

" O
Nay O

I O
have O
little O
more O
to O
tell O
you O

continued O
that O
gentleman O

" O
I O
asked O
him O
to O
inform O
me O
in O

     | O
all O
confidence O

how O
it O
came O
to O

He O
was O
silent O
for O
a O
time O

then O
refused O

Not O
|
     | O
only O
refused O
to O
answer O
that O
question O
, O

candidly O
told O
me O

would O
not O

another O
word O

the O

     | O
subject O

, O
thanking O
me O
for O
my O
trouble O

he O
all O

dismissed O
me O

Ungracious O
enough O

the O
whole O

it O
not O

I O
assure O
ye O
, O
I O
am O
twenty B-CARDINAL
times O

     | O
more O
inclined O
to O
think O
him O
innocent O

before O
I O

the O

There O
was O
a O
pause O

Mr. O

up O
again O

spoke O

" O
Mr. O
Duncombe B-PERSON
promised O
to O
be O
here O
to O
speak O
to O
his O
character O

I O
sent O
him O
a O
subpœna O
on O
Saturday B-TIME

night I-TIME

Though O
after O
all O

go O
very O
little O
by O
such O
general O

vague O
testimony O

that O
to O

     | O
character O

It O
is O
very O
right O
that O
they O
should O
not O
often O
  O
but O
in O
this O
instance O
unfortunate O
for O

     | O
us O
, O
as O
we O
must O
rest O
our O
case O

The O
pen O
went O
again O
, O
scratch O

scratch O
over O
the O
paper O

| 
  | O
Job O
grew O
very O
fidgetty O
. O
He O
sat O
on O
the O
edge O
of O
his O
chair O
, O
the O
more O
readily O
to O
start O
up O
when O
|
     | O
Will O
and O
Mary B-PERSON
should O
appear O
. O
He O
listened O
intently O
to O
every O
noise O
and O
every O
step O
on O
the O

     | O
stair O
. O
| 
  | O
Once O
he O
heard O
a O
man O
's O
footstep O
, O
and O
his O
old O
heart O
gave O
a O
leap O
of O
delight O
. O
But O
it O
was O
only O
Mr. O
|
     | O
Bridgenorth B-ORG
's O
clerk O
, O
bringing O
him O
a O
list O
of O
those O
cases O
in O
which O
the O
grand O
jury O
had O
found O
true O

     | O
bills O
. O
He O
glanced O
it O
over O
and O
pushed O
it O
to O
Job B-LOC
, O
merely O
saying O
, O
| 
  | O
" O
Of O
course O
we O
expected O
this O
, O
" O
and O
went O
on O
with O
his O
writing O
. O
| 
  | O
There O
was O
a O
true O
bill O
against O
James B-PERSON
Wilson I-PERSON
. O
Of O
course O
. O
And O
yet O
Job O
felt O
now O
doubly O
anxious O
|
     | O
and O
sad O
. O
It O
seemed O
the B-DATE
beginning I-DATE
of I-DATE
the I-DATE
end I-DATE
. O
He O
had O
got O
, O
by O
imperceptible O
degrees O
, O
to O
think O
Jem B-PERSON

     | O
innocent O
. O
Little O
by O
little O
this O
persuasion O
had O
come O
upon O
him O
. O

  | O
Mary B-PERSON
( O
tossing O
about O
in O
the O
little O
boat O
on O
the O
broad O
river O
) O
did O
not O
come O
, O
nor O
did O
Will O
. O
| 
  | O
Job O
grew O
very O
restless O
. O
He O
longed O
to O
go O
and O
watch O
for O
them O
out O
of O
the O
window O
, O
but O
feared O
to O
|
     | O
interrupt O
Mr. O
Bridgenorth B-PERSON
. O
At O
length O
his O
desire O
to O
look O
out O
was O
irresistible O
, O
and O
he O
got O
up O
and O
|
     | O
walked O
carefully O
and O
gently O
across O
the O
room O
, O
his O
boots O
creaking O
at O
every O
cautious O
step O
. O
The O
|
     | O
gloom O
which O
had O
overspread O
the O
sky O
, O
and O
the O
influence O
of O
which O
had O
been O
felt O
by O
Mary B-PERSON
on O
the O
|
     | O
open O
water O
, O
was O
yet O
more O
perceptible O
in O
the O
dark O
, O
dull O
street O
. O
Job O
grew O
more O
and O
more O
fidgetty O
. O
|
     | O
He O
was O
obliged O
to O
walk O
about O
the O
room O
, O
for O
he O
could O
not O
keep O
still O
  O
and O
he O
did O
so O
, O
regardless O
|
     | O
of O
Mr. O
Bridgenorth B-PERSON
's O
impatient O
little O
motions O
and O
noises O
, O
as O
the O
slow O
, O
stealthy O
, O
creaking O
|
     | O
movements O
were O
heard O
, O
backwards O
and O
forwards O
, O
behind O
his O
chair O
. O
| 
  | O
He O
really O
liked O
Job O
, O
and O
was O
interested O
for O
Jem B-PERSON
, O
else O
his O
nervousness O
would O
have O
overcome O
his O
|
     | O
sympathy O
long O
before O
it O
did O
. O
But O
he O
could O
hold O
out O
no O
longer O
against O
the O
monotonous O
, O
grating O
|
     | O
sound O
  O
so O
at O
last O
he O
threw O
down O
his O
pen O
, O
locked O
his O
portfolio O
, O
and O
taking O
up O
his O
hat O
and O
|
     | O
gloves O
, O
he O
told O
Job B-PERSON
he O
must O
go O
to O
the O
courts O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
But O
Will B-PERSON
Wilson I-PERSON
is O
not O
come O
, O
" O
said O
Job B-PERSON
, O
in O
dismay O
. O
" O
Just O
wait O
while O
I O
run O
to O
his O
lodgings O

I O

     | O
would O
have O
done O
it O
before O

I O
thought O
they O
'd O
be O
here O
every B-TIME

I O
were O
afraid O

my O
good O
fellow O
, O
I O
really O
must O
go O

Besides O
, O
I O
begin O
to O
think O
Johnson B-PERSON
must O
have O
made O
a O

     | O
mistake O
, O
and O
have O
fixed O
with O
this O
William B-PERSON
Wilson I-PERSON
to O
meet O
me O
at O
the O
courts O

If O
you O
like O
to O
wait O

     | O
for O
him O
here O
, O
pray O
make O
use O
of O
my O
room O
  O
but O
I O
've O
a O
notion O
I O
shall O
find O
him O
there O
: O
in O
which O

     | O
case O

I O
'll O

him O

You O
know O
where O
to O
find O
me O

I O
shall O
be O
here O
again O

     | O
by O
eight B-TIME
o'clock I-TIME
, O
and O
with O
the O
evidence O
of O
this O

to O
prove O
the O

     | O
I O
'll O
have O
the O
brief O
drawn O
out O

in O
the O
hands O

counsel O
to O
- O
night O

" O

  | O
So O
saying O
he O
shook O
hands O
with O
Job O
, O
and O
went O
his O
way O
. O
The O
old O
man O
considered O
for O
a B-TIME
minute I-TIME
as O

     | O
he O
lingered O
at O
the O
door O

then O
bent O
his O
steps O
towards O
Mrs. O
Jones B-PERSON

, O
where O
he O
knew O

he O
doubted O

both O
of O
him O

of O
Mary B-PERSON

He O
went O
there O
, O
and O
gathered O
what O
intelligence O
he O
could O
out O
of O
Mrs. O
Jones B-PERSON
's O
slow O
replies O
. O
| 
  | O
He O
asked O
if O
a O
young O
woman O
had O
been O
there O
that B-TIME
morning I-TIME

if O

" O
Why O

bless O
you O

'cause O
he O
had O
sailed O
some B-TIME
hours I-TIME
before O
she O
came O
asking O
for O
him O

" O

There O
was O
a O
dead O
silence O

broken O
only O
by O
the O

, O
heavy O
sound O

" O
Somewhere O
down O
at O
the O

so O
saying O

she O
quietly O
spat O
upon O
her O
fresh O
iron O
, O
to O
test O
its O
heat O
, O

     | O
and O
then O
went O
on O
with O
her O
business O

Job O
could O
have O
boxed O
her O

was O
in O
such O
a O
state O
of O
irritation O

he O
did O
not O
, O

he O
had O

     | O
his O
reward O

Charley B-PERSON
came O
in O
, O
whistling O
with O
an O
air O
of O
indifference O
, O
assumed O
to O
carry O
off O
his O

     | O
knowledge O
of O
the O
lateness O
of O
the B-TIME

" O
| 
  | O
It O
took O
Job O
some O
little O
time O
to O
understand O
this O
, O
from O
the O
confused O
use O
of O
the O
feminine O

     | O
pronoun O

Then O
he O
inquired O

find O

" O
I O
'll O

said O
his O
mother O
, O
setting O
her O
back O
against O
the O
door O
. O
The O
lad O
|
     | O
made O
a O
comical O
face O
at O
Job B-ORG
, O
which O
met O
with O
no O
responsive O
look O
from O
the O
old O
man O
, O
whose O

     | O
sympathies O
were O
naturally O
in O
favour O
of O
the O
parent O

he O
would O
thankfully O
have O
availed O

     | O
himself O
of O
Charley B-PERSON

offer O

for O

was O
weary O
, O

anxious O
to O
return O
to O
poor O
Mrs. O

who O

     | O
would O
be O
wondering O
what O

him O

" O

But O
Charley B-PERSON
was O
sullen O
at O
his O

exercise O
of O
authority O
before O
a O
stranger O
, O

at O
that O

     | O
stranger O

grave O
looks O

Unasked O

Mrs. O

who O
, O
in O
leaving O
her O
their O
boy O

had O
evidently O

     | O
left O
her O
rather O
more O
than O
she O
could O
manage O

She O
moaned O

croaked O
over O
sailors O

all O
over O

     | O
after O
Job B-LOC
had O
left O
off O
attending O
to O
her O
, O
and O
was O
only O
trying O
to O
hearken O
to O
every O

every O

     | O
voice O
in O
the O

At O
last O
Charley B-PERSON
came O
in O

he O
came O
alone O

" O
Yon B-PERSON

said O
he O
, O
addressing O
himself O
to O
Job B-PERSON

     | O
" O
She O
's O
not O

" O

     | O
said O
Job B-PERSON
, O
sorrowfully O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
So O
she O
said O
  O
at O
least O
somewhat O
of O
the O
kind O
, O
" O
said O
Charley B-PERSON
, O
looking O
desirous O
to O
hear O
more O
. O
|
     | O
But O
Job O
was O
silent O
. O
| 
  | O
He O
could O
not O
think O
of O
any O
thing O
further O
that O
could O
be O
done O
  O
so O
he O
rose O
up O
, O
and O
, O
thanking O
Mrs. O

     | O
Jones O
for O
the O
shelter O
she O
had O
given O
him O
, O
he O
went O
out O
into O
the O
street O
  O
and O
there O
he O
stood O
still O
, O
|
     | O
to O
ponder O
over O
probabilities O
and O
chances O
. O
| 
  | O
After O
some O
little O
time O
he O
slowly O
turned O
towards O
the O
lodging O
where O
he O
had O
left O
Mrs. O
Wilson B-PERSON
. O
|
     | O
There O
was O
nothing O
else O
to O
be O
done O
  O
but O
he O
loitered O
on O
the O
way O
, O
fervently O
hoping O
that O
her O
|
     | O
weariness O
and O
her O
woes O
might O
have O
sent O
her O
to O
sleep O
before O
his O
return O
, O
that O
he O
might O
be O
spared O
|
     | O
her O
questionings O
. O
| 
  | O
He O
went O
very O
gently O
into O
the O
house O
- O
place O
where O
the O
sleepy O
landlady O
awaited O
his O
coming O
and O
his O

     | O
bringing O
the O
girl O
, O
who O
, O
she O
had O
been O
told O
, O
was O
to O
share O
the O
old O
woman O
's O
bed O
. O
| 
  | O
But O
in O
her O
sleepy O
blindness O
she O
knocked O
things O
so O
about O
in O
lighting O
the O
candle O
( O
she O
could O
see O
|
     | O
to O
have O
a O
nap O
by O
fire O
- O
light O
, O
she O
said O
) O
, O
that O
the O
voice O
of O
Mrs. O

was O
heard O
from O
the O
little O

     | O
back O

room O
, O
where O
she O
was O
to O

the O
night O

  | O
" O
Who O

" O
| 
  | O
Job O
gave O
no O
answer O
, O
and O
kept O
down O
his O
breath O
, O
that O
she O
might O
think O
herself O
mistaken O
. O
The O
|
     | O
landlady O
, O
having O
no O
such O
care O
, O
dropped O
the O
snuffers O
with O
a O
sharp O
metallic O
sound O
, O
and O
then O
, O
by O
|
     | O
her O
endless O
apologies O
, O
convinced O
the O
listening O
woman O
that O

returned O

" O

anxiety O

many O

many O
a O
time O
through O

long O

scolded O
her O

himself O

her O

himself O

out O

did O
not O
pass O
that O
night O

any O
more O
than O

she O
was O
under O

respectable O
roof O
, O

     | O
and O
among O
kind O
, O
though O
rough O
people O

She O
had O
offered O
no O
resistance O
to O
the O
old O
boatman O
, O

he O

clutched O
her O
arm O
, O
in O
order O
to O
|
     | O
insure O
her O
following O
him O
, O
as O
he O
threaded O
the O
crowded O
dock O
- O
ways O
, O
and O
dived O
up O
strange O
|
     | O
bye O
- O
streets O

She O
came O
on O
meekly O
after O
him O
, O
scarcely O
thinking O
in O
her O
stupor O
where O
she O
was O
going O
, O
|
     | O
and O
glad O
( O
in O
a O
dead O
, O
heavy O
way O
) O
that O
some O
one O
was O
deciding O
things O
for O
her O
. O
| 
  | O
He O
led O
her O
to O
an O
old O
- O
fashioned O
house O
, O
almost O
as O
small O
as O
house O
could O
be O

which O
had O
been O
built O

     | O
long O
ago O
, O
before O
all O
the O
other O
part O
of O
the O
street O

had O
a O
country O
- O
town O
look O
about O
it O
in O
the O
|
     | O
middle O
of O
that O
bustling O
back O
street O
. O
He O
pulled O
her O
into O
the O
house O
- O
place O
  O
and O
relieved O
to O
a O
|
     | O
certain O
degree O
of O
his O
fear O
of O
losing O
her O
on O
the O
way O
, O
he O
exclaimed O
, O
| 
  | O
" O
There O
! O
" O
giving O
a O
great O
slap O
of O
one O
hand O
on O
her O
back O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
room O
was O
light O
and O
bright O
, O
and O
roused O
Mary B-PERSON
( O
perhaps O
the O
slap O
on O
her O
back O
might O
help O
a O

     | O
little O
, O
too O
) O
, O
and O
she O
felt O
the O
awkwardness O
of O
accounting O
for O
her O
presence O
to O
a O
little O
bustling O

     | O
old O
woman O

had O
been O
moving O
about O

fire O

entrance O

The O
boatman O
took O
it O
very O

     | O
quietly O
, O
never O
deigning O
to O
give O
any O
explanation O
, O

sitting O
down O
in O
his O
own O
particular O
chair O
, O

     | O
and O
chewing O
tobacco O
, O
while O
he O
looked O
at O
Mary B-PERSON
with O
the O
most O
satisfied O
air O
imaginable O
, O
half B-CARDINAL
|
     | O
triumphantly O
, O
as O
if O
she O
were O
the O
captive O
of O
his O
bow O
and O
spear O
, O
and O
half B-CARDINAL
defyingly O
, O
as O
if O
daring O

her O
to O
escape O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
old O
woman O
, O
his O
wife O
, O
stood O
still O
, O
poker O
in O
hand O
, O
waiting O
to O
be O
told O
who O
it O
was O
that O
her O

     | O
husband O
had O
brought O
home O
so O
unceremoniously O
  O

, O
as O
she O
looked O
in O
amazement O
the O
girl O

cheek O

     | O
flushed O
, O
and O
then O
blanched O
to O
a O
dead O
whiteness O
  O
a O
film O
came O
over O
her O
eyes O
, O
and O
catching O
at O
the O

     | O
dresser O
for O
support O
in O
that O
hot O
whirling O
room O

fell O
in O
a O
heap O
on O
the O
floor O

Both O
man O
and O
wife O
came O
quickly O
to O
her O
assistance O
. O
They O
raised O
her O
up O
, O
still O
insensible O
, O
and O

     | O
he O
supported O
her O
on O
one B-CARDINAL
knee O
, O
while O
his O
wife O
pattered O
away O
for O
some O
cold O
fresh O
water O
. O
She O
threw O
|
     | O
it O
straight O
over O
Mary B-PERSON
  O
but O
though O
it O
caused O
a O
great O
sob O
, O
the O
eyes O
still O
remained O
closed O
, O
and O

     | O
the O
face O
as O
pale O
as O
ashes O
. O

  | O
" O
Who O
is O
she O
, O
Ben B-PERSON
? O
" O
asked O
the O
woman O
, O
as O
she O
rubbed O
her O
unresisting O
, O
powerless O
hands O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
How O
should O
I O
know O

answered O
her O

gruffly O
. O

" O

ask O
aught O

Mrs. O

up O

said O
her O
husband O

She O
did O
as O
he O
desired O
, O
still O
crooning O
to O
herself O
, O
not O
caring O
for O
his O
short O
, O
sharp O

     | O
interruptions O
as O
she O
went O
on O
  O
and O
, O
indeed O
, O
to O
her O
old O
, O
loving O
heart O
, O
his O
crossest O
words O
fell O

     | O
like O
pearls O

diamonds O
, O
for O

had O
been O
the O

even O
he O

rough O

crabbed O

he O
was O

was O
secretly O
soothed O

not O
for O

if O

     | O
he O
could O

shown O
any O

the O

his O
rough O

" O
What O

the O
old O
fellow O
after O

said O
she O
, O
bending O
over O
Mary B-PERSON

so O

to O
sobbing O
at O
the O

     | O
thought O
of O
her O
waning O
hopes O
, O
and O
the O
old O
woman O
tried O
to O
comfort O
her O
, O
beginning O
with O
her O

     | O
accustomed O
, O
| 
  | O
" O
Well O

a O

well O

and O
he O
'll O
come O
back O
, O
I O

sure O
. O
I O
know O
he O
will O
  O
so O
keep O
up O

     | O
fret O
about O

" O

" O
Oh O

I O

sore O

" O
cried O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
consoled O
, O
nevertheless O
, O
by O
the O
|
     | O
woman O
's O
assertions O
, O
all O
groundless O
as O
she O
knew O
them O
to O
be O
. O
| 
  | O
Still O
talking O
half B-CARDINAL
to O
herself O
and O
half O
to O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
the O
old O
woman O
prepared O
tea O
, O
and O
urged O
her O
|
     | O
visitor O
to O
eat O
and O
refresh O
herself O
. O
But O
Mary B-PERSON
shook O
her O
head O
at O
the O
proffered O
food O
, O
and O
only O
|
     | O
drank O
a O
cup O
of O
tea O
with O
thirsty O
eagerness O
. O
For O
the O
spirits O
had O
thrown O
her O
into O
a O
burning O
heat O
, O
|
     | O
and O
rendered O
each O
impression O
received O
through O
her O
senses O
of O
the O
most O
painful O
distinctness O
and O
|
     | O
intensity O
, O
while O
her O
head O
ached O
in O
a O
terrible O
manner O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
disliked O
speaking O
, O
her O
power O
over O
her O
words O
seemed O
so O
utterly O
gone O
. O
She O
used O
quite O
|
     | O
different O
expressions O
to O
those O
she O
intended O
. O
So O
she O
kept O
silent O
, O
while O
Mrs. O
Sturgis B-PERSON
( O
for O
that O
|
     | O
was O
the O
name O
of O
her O
hostess O
) O
talked O
away O
, O
and O
put O
her O
tea O
- O
things O
by O
, O
and O
moved O
about O
|
     | O
incessantly O
, O
in O
a O
manner O
that O
increased O
the O
dizziness O
in O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
head O
. O
She O
felt O
as O
if O
she O
ought O
|
     | O
to O
take O
leave O
for O
the B-TIME
night I-TIME
and O
go O
. O
But O
where O
? O
| 
  | O
Presently O
the O
old O
man O
came O
back O
, O
crosser O
and O
gruffer O
than O
when O
he O
went O
away O
. O
He O
kicked O
aside O
|
     | O
the O
dry O
shoes O
his O
wife O
had O
prepared O
for O
him O
, O
and O
snarled O
at O
all O
she O
said O
. O
Mary B-PERSON
attributed O
this O
|
     | O
to O
his O
finding O
her O
still O
there O
, O
and O
gathered O
up O
her O
strength O
for O
an O
effort O
to O
leave O
the O
house O
. O
|
     | O
But O
she O
was O
mistaken O
. O
By O
- O
and O
- O
bye O
, O
he O
said O
( O
looking O
right O
into O
the O
fire O
, O
as O
if O

, O

     | O
" O

  | O
" O
Ay O

" O
said O
his O
wife O
, O
who O
, O
knowing O
him O
well O
, O
knew O
that O
his O
surliness O

     | O
proceeded O
from O
some O
repressed O
sympathy O
. O
" O

" O

  | O
She O
looked O
out O
of O
their O
little O
window O
at O
a O
weather O
- O
cock O
, O
near O
, O
glittering O
in O
the O
moonlight O
  O
|
     | O
and O
as O
she O
was O
a O
sailor O
's O
wife O
, O
she O
instantly O
recognised O
the O
unfavourable O
point O
at O
which O
the O
|
     | O
indicator O
seemed O
stationary O
, O
and O
giving O
a O
heavy O
sigh O
, O
turned O
into O
the O
room O
, O
and O
began O
to O
beat O
|
     | O
about O
in O
her O
own O
mind O
for O
some O
other O
mode O
of O
comfort O
. O

  | O
" O
There O

asked O

     | O
she O

  | O
" O
No O

answered O
Mary B-PERSON

" O

you O

  | O
Mary B-PERSON
did O
not O
answer O

trembled O
all O
over O
. O

Sturgis O
saw O
it O

  | O
" O

  | O
Mary B-PERSON
went O
up O
- O
stairs O
murmuring O
thanks O
and O
blessings O
on O
those O
who O
took O
the O
stranger O
in O
. O
Mrs. O

     | O
Sturgis B-PERSON
led O
her O
into O
a O
little O
room O
redolent O
of O
the O
sea O
and O
foreign O
lands O
. O
There O
was O
a O
small O
bed O

     | O
for O
one B-CARDINAL
son O
, O
bound O
for O
China B-GPE
  O

a O
hammock O
slung O
above O
for O
another O
, O
who O
was O
now O
tossing O
in O
the O

     | O
Baltic B-LOC
. O
The O
sheets O
looked O
made O
out O
of O
sail O
- O
cloth O
, O
but O
were O
fresh O
and O
clean O
in O
spite O
of O
their O
|
     | O
brownness O
. O
| 
  | O
Against O
the O
wall O
were O
wafered O
two B-CARDINAL
rough O
drawings O
of O
vessels O
with O
their O
names O
written O

     | O
underneath O
, O
on O
which O
the O
mother O
's O
eyes O
caught O
, O
and O
gazed O
until O
they O
filled O
with O
tears O
. O
But O
she O

     | O
brushed O
the O
drops O
away O
with O
the O
back O
of O
her O
hand O
, O
and O
in O
a O
cheerful O
tone O
went O
on O
to O
assure O
Mary B-PERSON

     | O
the O
bed O
was O
well O
aired O

" O

sinking O
down O

" O

pleaded O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
as O
her O
hostess O
seemed O
so O
resolute O
about O
seeing O
her O

Her O

quietly O

noiselessly O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
watched O
the O
unchanging O

     | O
his O
aching O
limbs O

the O
twitchings O

With O
daylight O
increased O
power O

he O
drove O
off O

     | O
worry O
him O
with O

sat O

What O

all O

in O
compliance O
with O

almost O

vowed O

At O

Job B-PERSON

had O
carefully O
avoided O
any O
questioning O
from O
Mrs. O
Wilson B-PERSON
that B-TIME
morning I-TIME
. O
Indeed O
he O
had O

     | O
not O
been O
much O
in O
her O
company O
, O
for O
he O
had O
risen O
up O
early O
to O
go O
out O
once O
more O
to O
make O
inquiry O
for O

     | O
Mary B-PERSON
  O
and O
when O
he O
could O
hear O
nothing O
of O
her O
, O
he O
had O
desperately O
resolved O
not O
to O
undeceive O
Mrs. O

     | O
Wilson B-ORG
, O
as O
sorrow O
never O
came O
too O
late O
  O
and O
if O
the O
blow O
were O
inevitable O
, O
it O
would O
be O
better O
to O
|
     | O
leave O
her O
in O
ignorance O
of O
the O
impending O
evil O
as O
long O
as O
possible O

She O
took O
her O
place O
in O
the O

     | O
witness O
- O
room O
, O
worn O
and O
dispirited O
, O
but O
not O
anxious O
. O

  | O
As O
Job O
struggled O
through O
the O
crowd O
into O
the O
body O
of O
the O
court O
, O
Mr. O
Bridgenorth B-PERSON
's O
clerk O

     | O
beckoned O
to O
him O

" O
Here O

a O
letter O
for O
you O
from O
our O
client O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
Job O
sickened O
as O
he O
took O
it O
. O
He O
did O
not O
know O
why O
, O
but O
he O
dreaded O
a O
confession O
of O
guilt O
, O
which O
|
     | O
would O
be O
an O
overthrow O
of O
all O
hope O

The O
letter O
ran O

    | O
Dear B-ORG
Friend I-ORG
| | O
, O
— O
I O
thank O
you O
heartily O
for O
your O
goodness O
in O
finding O
me O
a O
lawyer O
, O
but O
|
      | O
lawyers O
can O
do O
no O
good O
to O
me O
, O
whatever O
they O
may O
do O
to O
other O
people O
. O
But O
I O
am O
not O
the O
less O
|
      | O
obliged O
to O
you O
, O
dear O
friend O
. O
I O
foresee O
things O
will O
go O
against O
me O
— O
and O
no O
wonder O
. O
If O
I O
was O
a O
|
      | O
jury O
- O
man O
, O
I O
should O
say O
the O
man O
was O
guilty O
as O
had O
as O
much O
evidence O
brought O
against O
him O
as O
may O
|
      | O
be O
brought O
against O
me O
to O
- O
morrow O
. O
So O
it O
's O
no O
blame O
to O
them O
if O
they O
do O
. O
But O
, O
Job B-PERSON
Legh I-PERSON
, O
I O
think O
I O
|
      | O
need O
not O
tell O
you O
I O
am O
as O
guiltless O
in O
this O
matter O
as O
the O
babe O
unborn O
, O
although O
it O
is O
not O
in O
|
      | O
my O
power O
to O
prove O
it O
. O
If O
I O
did O
not O
believe O
that O
you O
thought O
me O
innocent O
, O
I O
could O
not O
write O
as O
|
      | O
I O
do O
now O
to O
tell O
you O
my O
wishes O
. O
You O
'll O
not O
forget O
they O
are O
the O
wishes O
of O
a O
man O
shortly O
to O
die O
. O
|
      | O
Dear O
friend O
, O
you O
must O
take O
care O
of O
my O
mother O
. O
Not O
in O
the O
money O
way O
, O
for O
she O
will O
have O
enough O
|
      | O
for O
her O
and O
Aunt B-PERSON
Alice I-PERSON
  O
but O
you O
must O
let O
her O
talk O
to O
you O
of O
me O
  O
and O
show O
her O
that O
( O
whatever O
|
      | O
others O
may O
do O
) O
you O
think O
I O
died O
innocent O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
reckon O
she O
will O
stay O
long O
behind O
when O
we O
are O
|
      | O
all O
gone O
. O
Be O
tender O
with O
her O
, O
Job B-PERSON
, O
for O
my O
sake O
  O
and O
if O
she O
is O
a O
bit O
fractious O
at O
times O
, O
|
      | O
remember O
what O
she O
has O
gone O
through O
. O
I O
know O
mother O
will O
never O
doubt O
me O
, O
God B-PERSON
bless O
her O
. O
| 
  | O
There O
is O
one B-CARDINAL
other O
whom O
I O
fear O
I O
have O
loved O
too O
dearly O
  O
and O
yet O
, O
the O
loving O
her O
has O
made O
the O
|
      | O
happiness O
of O
my O
life O
. O
She O
will O
think O
I O
have O
murdered O
her O
lover O
  O
she O
will O
think O
I O
have O
caused O
|
      | O
the O
grief O
she O
must O
be O
feeling O
. O
And O
she O
must O
go O
on O
thinking O
so O
. O
It O
is O
hard O
upon O
me O
to O
say O
this O
  O
|
      | O
but O
she O
|  | O
must O
| | O
. O
It O
will O
be O
best O
for O
her O
, O
and O
that O
's O
all O
I O
ought O
to O
think O
on O
. O
But O
, O
dear O
|
      | O
Job O
, O
you O
are O
a O
hearty O
fellow O
for O
your O
time O
of O
life O
, O
and O
may O
live O
a O
many O
years O
to O
come O
  O
and O
|
      | O
perhaps O
you O
could O
tell O
her O
, O
when O
you O
felt O
sure O
you O
were O
drawing O
near O
your O
end O
, O
that O
I O
solemnly O
|
      | O
told O
you O
( O
as O
I O
do O
now O
) O
that O
I O
was O
innocent O
of O
this O
thing O
. O
You O
must O
not O
tell O
her O
for O
many B-DATE
years I-DATE
|
      | O
to O
come O
  O
but O
I O
can O
not O
well O
bear O
to O
think O
on O
her O
living O
through O
a O
long O
life O
, O
and O
hating O
the O
|
      | O
thought O
of O
me O
as O
the O
murderer O
of O
him O
she O
loved O
, O
and O
dying O
with O
that O
hatred O
to O
me O
in O
her O
heart O
. O
|
      | O
It O
would O
hurt O
me O
sore O
in O
the O
other O
world O
to O
see O
the O
look O
of O
it O
in O
her O
face O
, O
as O
it O
would O
be O
, O
|
      | O
till O
she O
was O
told O
. O
I O
must O
not O
let O
myself O
think O
on O
how O
she O
must O
be O
viewing O
me O
now O

So O
God B-PERSON
bless O

no O

Job O
turned O
the O
letter O
over O
and O
over O
when O
he O
had O
read O
it O
  O
sighed O
deeply O
  O

then O
wrapping O
it O

     | O
carefully O
up O
in O
a O
bit O
of O
newspaper O

had O
about O

he O
put O
it O
in O
his O

     | O
went O
off O

ask O

As O
the O

her O
sitting O

against O
a O
table O

her O
folded O

were O

resting O

and O
her O
head O
was O
hidden O
within O
them O

It O
was O
an O
attitude O
of O
hopelessness O
, O
and O
would O

     | O
have O
served O
to O
strike O
Job B-PERSON
dumb O

sickness O

even O
without O
the O

Sorrowfully O

Although O

was O
a O
pause O

an O
interval O

recapitulation O

At O
first B-ORDINAL

both O
were O
silent O

as O
one O
of O

because O
, O
in O

her O
appearance O

beyond O
her B-DATE
years I-DATE

which O
might O
not O
be O
many O
above O
fifty B-CARDINAL
. O
But O
partly O
|
     | O
owing O
to O
her O
accident O
in O
early O
life O
, O
which O
left O
a O
stamp O
of O
pain O
upon O
her O
face O

partly O
owing O
to O

     | O
her O
anxious O
temper O
, O
partly O
to O
her O
sorrows O
, O
and O
partly O
to O
her O
limping O
gait O
, O
she O
always O
gave O
me O
|
     | O
the O
idea O
of O
age O
. O
But O
now O
she O
might O
have O
seemed O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
seventy I-CARDINAL

her O
lines O
were O
so O
set O

     | O
deep O
, O
her O
features O
so O
sharpened O
, O
and O
her O
walk O
so O
feeble O
. O
She O
was O
trying O
to O
check O
her O
sobs O
into O
|
     | O
composure O
, O
and O
( O
unconsciously O
) O
was O
striving O
to O
behave O
as O
she O
thought O
would O
best O
please O
her O
poor O

     | O
boy O
, O
whom O
she O
knew O
she O
had O
often O
grieved O
by O
her O
uncontrolled O
impatience O
. O
He O
had O
buried O
his O
face O
|
     | O
in O
his O
arms O
, O
which O
rested O
on O
the O
front O
of O
the O
dock O
( O
an O
attitude O
he O
retained O
during O
the O
greater O
|
     | O
part O
of O
his O
trial O

against O

  | O
The O
counsel O
began O
the O
examination O

" O

" O

with O
quivering O
voice O
, O
ready O
to O
break O
out O
into O
weeping O
, O

earning O
respect O
by O
the O
|
     | O
strong O
effort O
at O
self O
- O
control O
, O
prompted O
, O
as O
I O
have O
said O
before O

her O
earnest O

her O
son O

The O
barrister O
now O
proceeded O
to O
the O
important O
part O
of O
the O
examination O
, O
tending O
to O
prove O
that O
|
     | O
the O
gun O
found O
on O
the O
scene O
of O
the O
murder O
was O
the O
prisoner O
's O
. O
She O
had O
committed O
herself O
so O
fully O
|
     | O
to O
the O
policeman O
, O
that O
she O
could O
not O
well O
retract O
  O
so O
without O
much O
delay O
in O
bringing O
the O
|
     | O
question O
round O
to O
the O
desired O
point O
, O
the O
gun O
was O
produced O
in O
court O
, O
and O
the O
inquiry O
made O
— O
| 
  | O
" O
That O
gun O
belongs O
to O
your O
son O
, O
does O
it O
not O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
She O
clenched O
the O
sides O
of O
the O
witness O
- O
box O
in O
her O
efforts O
to O
make O
her O
parched O
tongue O
utter O
|
     | O
words O
. O
At O
last O
she O
moaned O
forth O
, O
| 
  | O
" O
Oh O
! O
Jem B-PERSON
, O
Jem B-PERSON
! O
what O
mun O
I O
say O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
Every O
one O
bent O
forward O
to O
hear O
the O
prisoner O
's O
answer O
  O
although O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
it O
was O
of O
little O
|
     | O
importance O
to O
the O
issue O
of O
the O
trial O
. O
He O
lifted O
up O
his O
head O
  O
and O
with O
a O
face O
brimming O
full O
of O
|
     | O
pity O
for O
his O
mother O
, O
yet O
resolved O
into O
endurance O
, O
said O
, O
| 
  | O
" O
Tell O
the O
truth O
, O
mother O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
And O
so O
she O
did O
, O
with O
the O
fidelity O
of O
a O
little O
child O
. O
Every O
one O
felt O
that O
she O
did O
  O
and O
the O
|
     | O
little O
colloquy O
between O
mother O
and O
son O
did O
them O
some O
slight O
service O
in O
the O
opinion O
of O
the O
|
     | O
audience O
. O
But O
the O
awful O
judge O
sat O
unmoved O
  O
and O
the O
jurymen O
changed O
not O
a O
muscle O
of O
their O
|
     | O
countenances O
  O
while O
the O
counsel O
for O
the O
prosecution O
went O
triumphantly O
through O
this O
part O
of O
the O

     | O
case O

including O
the O
fact O

bear O
right O
against O
the O
prisoner O

It O
was O
over O

She O
was O
told O
to O
go O
down O

she O
could O
no O

compel O
her O
mother O

heart O
to O

keep O

she O
imagined O
the O
verdict O

she O
thus O
addressed O
him O

her O

voice O

While O
sobbing O
out O
these O
words O
she O
was O
led O
away O
by O
the O
officers O
of O
the O
court O
, O
but O
tenderly O
, O
|
     | O
and O
reverently O
, O
with O
the O
respect O
which O
great O
sorrow O
commands O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
stream O
of O
evidence O
went O
on O
and O
on O
, O
gathering O
fresh O
force O
from O
every O
witness O
who O
was O
|
     | O
examined O
, O
and O
threatening O
to O
overwhelm O
poor O
Jem B-PERSON
. O
Already O
they O
had O
proved O
that O
the O
gun O
was O
his O
, O
|
     | O
that O
he O
had O
been O
heard O
not O
many O
days O
before O
the O
commission O
of O
the O
deed O
to O
threaten O
the O
|
     | O
deceased O
  O
indeed O
, O
that O
the O
police O
had O
, O
at O
that O
time O
, O
been O
obliged O
to O
interfere O
to O
prevent O
some O
|
     | O
probable O
act O
of O
violence O
. O
It O
only O
remained O
to O
bring O
forward O
a O
sufficient O
motive O
for O
the O
threat O
|
     | O
and O
the O
murder O
. O
The O
clue O
to O
this O
had O
been O
furnished O
by O
the O
policeman O
, O
who O
had O
overheard O
Jem B-PERSON
's O
|
     | O
angry O
language O
to O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON
  O
and O
his O
report O
in O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
instance O
had O
occasioned O
the O
subpœna O
|
     | O
to O
Mary B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
And O
now O
she O
was O
to O
be O
called O
on O
to O
bear O
witness O
. O
The O
court O
was O
by O
this O
time O
almost O
as O
full O
as O
|
     | O
it O
could O
hold O
  O
but O
fresh O
attempts O
were O
being O
made O
to O
squeeze O
in O
at O
all O
the O
entrances O
, O
for O
many O
|
     | O
were O
anxious O
to O
see O
and O
hear O
this O
part O
of O
the O
trial O
. O
| 
  | O
Old O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON
felt O
an O
additional O
beat O
at O
his O
heart O
at O
the O
thought O
of O
seeing O
the O
fatal O
Helen B-GPE
, O
|
     | O
the O
cause O
of O
all O
— O
a O
kind O
of O
interest O
and O
yet O
repugnance O
, O
for O
was O
not O
she O
beloved O
by O
the O
dead O
  O
|
     | O
nay O
, O
perhaps O
in O
her O
way O
, O
loving O
and O
mourning O
for O
the O
same O
being O
that O
he O
himself O
was O
so O
bitterly O
|
     | O
grieving O
over O
? O
And O
yet O
he O
felt O
as O
if O
he O
abhorred O
her O
and O
her O
rumoured O
loveliness O
, O
as O
if O
she O
|
     | O
were O
the O
curse O
against O
him O
  O
and O
he O
grew O
jealous O
of O
the O
love O
with O
which O
she O
had O
inspired O
his O
|
     | O
son O
, O
and O
would O
fain O
have O
deprived O
her O
of O
even O
her O
natural O
right O
of O
sorrowing O
over O
her O
lover O
's O
|
     | O
untimely O
end O
: O
for O
you O
see O
it O
was O
a O
fixed O
idea O
in O
the O
minds O
of O
all O
, O
that O
the O
handsome O
, O
bright O
, O
|
     | O
gay O
, O
rich O
young O
gentleman O
must O
have O
been O
beloved O
in O
preference O
to O
the O
serious O
, O
almost O
|
     | O
stern O
- O
looking O
smith O
, O
who O
had O
to O
toil O
for O
his O
daily B-DATE
bread O
. O
| 
  | O
Hitherto B-PERSON
the O
effect O
of O
the O
trial O
had O
equalled O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON
's O
most O
sanguine O
hopes O
, O
and O
a O
severe O
|
     | O
look O
of O
satisfaction O
came O
over O
the O
face O
of O
the O
avenger,—over O
that O
countenance O
whence O
the O
smile O
|
     | O
had O
departed O
, O
never O
more O
to O
return O
. O
| 
  | O
All O
eyes O
were O
directed O
to O
the O
door O
through O
which O
the O
witnesses O
entered O
. O
Even O
Jem B-PERSON
looked O
up O
to O
|
     | O
catch O
one B-CARDINAL
glimpse O
before O
he O
hid O
his O
face O
from O
her O
look O
of O
aversion O
. O
The O
officer O
had O
gone O
to O
|
     | O
fetch O
her O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
was O
in O
exactly O
the O
same O
attitude O
as O
when O
Job B-PERSON
Legh I-PERSON
had O
seen O
her B-TIME
two I-TIME
hours I-TIME
before O
through O
|
     | O
the O
half O
- O
open O
door O
. O
Not O
a O
finger O
had O
moved O
. O
The O
officer O
summoned O
her O
, O
but O
she O
did O
not O
stir O
. O
She O
|
     | O
was O
so O
still O
he O
thought O
she O
had O
fallen O
asleep O
, O
and O
he O
stepped O
forward O
and O
touched O
her O
. O
She O
|
     | O
started O
up O
in O
an O
instant O
, O
and O
followed O
him O
with O
a O
kind O
of O
rushing O
rapid O
motion O
into O
the O
court O
, O
|
     | O
into O
the O
witness O
- O
box O
. O
| 
  | O
And O
amid O
all O
that O
sea O
of O
faces O
, O
misty O
and O
swimming O
before O
her O
eyes O
, O
she O
saw O
but O
two B-CARDINAL
clear O
|
     | O
bright O
spots O
, O
distinct O
and O
fixed O
: O
the O
judge O
, O
who O
might O
have O
to O
condemn O
  O
and O
the O
prisoner O
, O
who O
|
     | O
might O
have O
to O
die O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
mellow O
sunlight O
streamed O
down O
that O
high O
window O
on O
her O
head O
, O
and O
fell O
on O
the O
rich O
treasure O
|
     | O
of O
her O
golden O
hair O
, O
stuffed O
away O
in O
masses O
under O
her O
little O
bonnet O
- O
cap O
  O
and O
in O
those O
warm O
beams O
|
     | O
the O
motes O
kept O
dancing O
up O
and O
down O
. O
The O
wind O
had O
changed O
— O
had O
changed O
almost O
as O
soon O
as O
she O
had O
|
     | O
given O
up O
her O
watching O
  O
the O
wind O
had O
changed O
, O
and O
she O
heeded O
it O
not O
. O
| 
  | O
Many O
who O
were O
looking O
for O
mere O
flesh O
and O
blood O
beauty O
, O
mere O
colouring O
, O
were O
disappointed O
  O
for O
|
     | O
her O
face O
was O
deadly O
white O
, O
and O
almost O
set O
in O
its O
expression O
, O
while O
a O
mournful O
bewildered O
soul O
|
     | O
looked O
out O
of O
the O
depths O
of O
those O
soft O
, O
deep O
, O
gray O
eyes O
. O
But O
others O
recognised O
a O
higher O
and O
|
     | O
stranger O
kind O
of O
beauty O
  O
one O
that O
would O
keep O
its O
hold O
on O
the O
memory O
for O
many O
after O
years O
. O
| 
  | O
I O
was O
not O
there O
myself O
  O
but O
one O
who O
was O
, O
told O
me O
that O
her O
look O
, O
and O
indeed O
her O
whole O
face O
, O
|
     | O
was O
more O
like O
the O
well O
- O
known O
engraving O
from O
Guido B-ORG
's O
picture O
of O
" O
Beatrice B-WORK_OF_ART
Cenci I-WORK_OF_ART
" O
than O
any O
thing O
|
     | O
else O
he O
could O
give O
me O
an O
idea O
of O
. O
He O
added O
, O
that O
her O
countenance O
haunted O
him O
, O
like O
the O
|
     | O
remembrance O
of O
some O
wild O
sad O
melody O
, O
heard O
in O
childhood O
  O
that O
it O
would O
perpetually O
recur O
with O
|
     | O
its O
mute O
imploring O
agony O
. O
| 
  | O
With O
all O
the O
court O
reeling O
before O
her O
( O
always O
save O
and O
except O
those O
awful O
two B-CARDINAL
) O
, O
she O
heard O
a O
|
     | O
voice O
speak O
, O
and O
answered O
the O
simple O
inquiry O
( O
something O
about O
her O
name O
) O
mechanically O
, O
as O
if O
in O
|
     | O
a O
dream O
. O
So O
she O
went O
on O
for O
two B-CARDINAL
or I-CARDINAL
three I-CARDINAL
more O
questions O
, O
with O
a O
strange O
wonder O
in O
her O
brain O
, O
as O
|
     | O
to O
the O
reality O
of O
the O
terrible O
circumstances O
in O
which O
she O
was O
placed O
. O
| 
  | O
Suddenly O
she O
was O
roused O
, O
she O
knew O
not O
how O
or O
by O
what O
. O
She O
was O
conscious O
that O
all O
was O
real O
, O
|
     | O
that O
hundreds B-CARDINAL
were O
looking O
at O
her O
, O
that O
true O
- O
sounding O
words O
were O
being O
extracted O
from O
her O
  O
that O
|
     | O
that O
figure O
, O
so O
bowed O
down O
, O
with O
the O
face O
concealed O
by O
both O
hands O
, O
was O
really O
Jem B-PERSON
. O
Her O
face O
|
     | O
flushed O
scarlet O
, O
and O
then O
paler O
than O
before O
. O
But O
in O
her O
dread O
of O
herself O
, O
with O
the O
tremendous O
|
     | O
secret O
imprisoned O
within O
her O
, O
she O
exerted O
every O
power O
she O
had O
to O
keep O
in O
the O
full O
understanding O
|
     | O
of O
what O
was O
going O
on O
, O
of O
what O
she O
was O
asked O
, O
and O
of O
what O
she O
answered O
. O
With O
all O
her O
faculties O
|
     | O
preternaturally O
alive O
and O
sensitive O
, O
she O
heard O
the O
next O
question O
from O
the O
pert O
young O
barrister O
, O
|
     | O
who O
was O
delighted O
to O
have O
the O
examination O
of O
this O
witness O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
And O
pray O
, O
may O
I O
ask O
, O
which O
was O
the O
favoured O
lover O
? O
You O
say O
you O
knew O
both O
these O
young O
men O
. O
|
     | O
Which O
was O
the O
favoured O
lover O
? O
Which O
did O
you O
prefer O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
And O
who O
was O
he O
, O
the O
questioner O
, O
that O
he O
should O
dare O
so O
lightly O
to O
ask O
of O
her O
heart O
's O
secrets O
? O
|
     | O
That O
he O
should O
dare O
to O
ask O
her O
to O
tell O
, O
before O
that O
multitude O
assembled O
there O
, O
what O
woman O
|
     | O
usually O
whispers O
with O
blushes O
and O
tears O
, O
and O
many O
hesitations O
, O
to O
one O
ear O
alone O
? O
| 
  | O
So O
, O
for O
an O
instant O
, O
a O
look O
of O
indignation O
contracted O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
brow O
, O
as O
she O
steadily O
met O
the O
|
     | O
eyes O
of O
the O
impertinent O
counsellor O
. O
But O
, O
in O
that O
instant O
, O
she O
saw O
the O
hands O
removed O
from O
a O
face O
|
     | O
beyond O
, O
behind O
  O
and O
a O
countenance O
revealed O
of O
such O
intense O
love O
and O
woe,—such O
a O
deprecating O
|
     | O
dread O
of O
her O
answer O
  O
and O
suddenly O
her O
resolution O
was O
taken O
. O
The O
present O
was O
everything O
  O
the O
|
     | O
future O
, O
that O
vast O
shroud O
, O
it O
was O
maddening O
to O
think O
upon O
  O
but O
|  | O
now O
|  | O
she O
might O
own O
her O
|
     | O
fault O
, O
but O
|  | O
now O
|  | O
she O
might O
even O
own O
her O
love O
. O
Now O
, O
when O
the O
beloved O
stood O
thus O
, O
abhorred O
|
     | O
of O
men O
, O
there O
would O
be O
no O
feminine O
shame O
to O
stand O
between O
her O
and O
her O
avowal O
. O
So O
she O
also O
|
     | O
turned O
towards O
the O
judge O
, O
partly O
to O
mark O
that O
her O
answer O
was O
not O
given O
to O
the O
monkeyfied O
man O
|
     | O
who O
questioned O
her O
, O
and O
likewise O
that O
her O
face O
might O
be O
averted O
from O
, O
and O
her O
eyes O
not O
gaze O
|
     | O
upon O
, O
the O
form O
that O
contracted O
with O
the O
dread O
of O
the O
words O
he O
anticipated O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
He O
asks O
me O
which O
of O
them O
two B-CARDINAL
I O
liked O
the O
best O
. O
Perhaps O
I O

he O

     | O
never O
known O

this B-TIME

For O
you O
see O
, O
sir O
, O
mother O
died O
before O
I O
was O
thirteen B-DATE
, O
|
     | O
before O
I O
could O
know O
right O
from O
wrong O
about O
some O
things O
  O
and O
I O
was O
giddy O
and O
vain O
, O
and O
ready O
to O
|
     | O
listen O
to O
any O
praise O
of O
my O
good O
looks O
  O
and O
this O
poor O
young O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON
fell O
in O
with O
me O
, O
and O
told O
|
     | O
me O
he O
loved O
me O
  O
and O
I O
was O
foolish O
enough O
to O
think O
he O
meant O
me O
marriage O
: O
a O
mother O
is O
a O
pitiful O
|
     | O
loss O
to O
a O
girl O
, O
sir O
  O
and O
so O
I O
used O
to O
fancy O
I O
could O
like O
to O
be O
a O
lady O
, O
and O
rich O
, O
and O
never O
know O
|
     | O
want O
any O
more O
. O
I O
never O
found O
out O
how O
dearly O
I O
loved O
another O
till O
one O
day O
, O
when O
James B-PERSON
Wilson I-PERSON
|
     | O
asked O
me O
to O
marry O
him O
, O
and O
I O
was O
very O
hard O
and O
sharp O
in O
my O
answer O
( O
for O
indeed O
, O
sir O
, O
I O
'd O
a O
deal O
|
     | O
to O
bear O
just O
then O
) O
, O
and O
he O
took O
me O
at O
my O
word O
and O
left O
me O
  O
and O
from O
that B-DATE
day I-DATE
to O
this O
I O
've O
never O
|
     | O
spoken O
a O
word O
to O
him O
, O
or O
set O
eyes O
on O
him O
  O
though O
I O
'd O
fain O
have O
done O
so O
, O
to O
try O
and O
show O
him O
we O

     | O
had O
both O
been O
too O
hasty O
  O
for O
he O
'd O
not O
been O
gone O
out O
of O
my O
sight O
above O
a O
minute O
before O
I O
knew O
I O

     | O
loved O
— O
far O
above O
my O
life O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
dropping O
her O
voice O
as O
she O
came O
to O
this O
second B-ORDINAL
confession O
of O
|
     | O
the O
strength O
of O
her O
attachment O
. O
" O
But O
, O
if O
the O
gentleman O
asks O
me O
which O
I O
loved O
the O
best O
, O
I O
make O
|
     | O
answer O
, O
I O
was O
flattered O
by O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON
, O
and O
pleased O
with O
his O
flattery O
  O
but O
James B-PERSON
Wilson I-PERSON
I O
— O
" O
| 
  | O
She O
covered O
her O
face O
with O
her O
hands O
, O
to O
hide O
the O
burning O
scarlet O
blushes O
, O
which O
even O
dyed O
her O
|
     | O
fingers O
. O
| 
  | O
There O
was O
a O
little O
pause O
  O
still O
, O
though O
her O
speech O
might O
inspire O
pity O
for O
the O
prisoner O
, O
it O
|
     | O
only O
strengthened O
the O
supposition O
of O
his O
guilt O
. O
Presently O
the O
counsellor O
went O
on O
with O
his O

     | O
examination O

  | O
" O

you O

your O
rejection O

what O

the O

your O
conversation O

you O

I O
never O

so O
bold O

to O
tell O
one B-CARDINAL
young O
man O
I O
cared O

I O
never O

final O
conversation O

his O

I O
kept O
steady O

at O

     | O
last O
I O
ran O
off O

Now O

out O

may O
not O
I O
go O
down O

" O
| 
  | O
For O
she O
felt O
the O
sense O
, O
the O
composure O
, O
the O
very O
bodily O
strength O
which O
she O
had O
compelled O
to O

     | O
her O
aid O
for O
a O
time O
, O
suddenly O
giving O
way O
, O

was O
conscious O
that O
she O
was O
losing O
all O

herself O

There O
was O
no O

her O
part O

might O
go O
down O

     | O
The O
evidence O
was O
still O
stronger O
against O
the O
prisoner O

now O
he O
stood O
erect O

firm O
, O
with O

     | O
self O
- O
respect O
in O
his O
attitude O
, O
and O
a O
look O
of O
determination O
on O
his O
face O
, O
which O
almost O
made O
it O

     | O
appear O
noble O

seemed O
lost O

Job B-PERSON
Legh I-PERSON
had O
all O
this O

soothe O

comfort O
Mrs. O

who O
would O
first O
be O

in O
the O
court O

in O
order O
to O
see O
her O
darling O
, O
and O
then O
, O
when O
her O
sobs O
became O
irrepressible O
, O
had O
to O
|
     | O
be O
led O
out O
into O
the O
open O
air O
, O
and O
sat O
there O
weeping O
, O
on O
the O
steps O

the O
court O

house O

Who O
would O

taken O
charge O

her O
release O

boatman O

her O
interest O

she O
now O

pressed O

the O
trial O

" O
No O

no O

to O
this O
proposition O

" O
I O

replied O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
strange O
hurried O
|
     | O
manner O
, O
catching O
hold O
of O
some O
rails O
as O
if O
she O
feared O
some O
bodily O
force O
would O
be O
employed O
to O

     | O
remove O
her O
. O
So O
Mrs. O
Sturgis B-PERSON
just O
waited O
patiently O
by O
her O
, O
every O
now O

then O
peeping O
among O
the O

     | O
congregation O
of O
heads O
in O
the O
body O
of O
the O
court O

to O
see O
if O
her O
husband O
were O
still O
there O
. O
And O
|
     | O
there O
he O
always O
was O
to O
be O
seen O
, O
looking O
and O
listening O
with O
all O
his O
might O
. O
His O
wife O
felt O
easy O
|
     | O
that O
he O
would O
not O
be O
wanting O
her O
at O
home O
until O
the O
trial O
was O
ended O
. O
| 
  | O
Mary B-PERSON
never O
let O
go O
her O
clutched O
hold O
on O
the O
rails O
. O
She O
wanted O
them O
to O
steady O
her O
, O
in O
that O
|
     | O
heaving O
, O
whirling O
court O
. O
She O
thought O
the O
feeling O
of O
something O
hard O
compressed O
within O
her O
hand O
|
     | O
would O
help O
her O
to O
listen O
, O
for O
it O
was O
such O
pain O
, O
such O
weary O
pain O
in O
her O
head O
, O
to O
strive O
to O
|
     | O
attend O
to O
what O
was O
being O
said O
. O
They O
were O
all O
at O
sea O
, O
sailing O
away O
on O
billowy O
waves O
, O
and O
every O
|
     | O
one B-CARDINAL
speaking O
at O
once O
, O
and O
no O
one O
heeding O
her O
father O
, O
who O
was O
calling O
on O
them O
to O
be O
silent O
, O
and O
|
     | O
listen O
to O
him O
. O
Then O
again O
, O
for O
a O
brief O
second B-ORDINAL
, O
the O
court O
stood O
still O
, O
and O
she O
could O
see O
the O
|
     | O
judge O
, O
sitting O
up O
there O
like O
an O
idol O
, O
with O
his O
trappings O
, O
so O
rigid O
and O
stiff O
  O
and O
Jem B-PERSON
, O
|
     | O
opposite O
, O
looking O
at O
her O
, O
as O
if O
to O
say O
, O
Am O
I O
to O
die O
for O
what O
you O
know O
your O
— O
— O
. O
Then O
she O
checked O
|
     | O
herself O
, O
and O
by O
a O
great O
struggle O
brought O
herself O
round O
to O
an O
instant O
's O
sanity O
. O
But O
the O
round O
of O
|
     | O
thought O
never O
stood O
still O
  O
and O
off O
she O
went O
again O
  O
and O
every O
time O
her O
power O
of O
struggling O
|
     | O
against O
the O
growing O
delirium O
grew O
fainter O
and O
fainter O
. O
She O
muttered O
low O
to O
herself O
, O
but O
no O
one O
|
     | O
heard O
her O
except O
her O
neighbour O
, O
Mrs. O
Sturgis B-PERSON
  O
all O
were O
too O
closely O
attending O
to O
the O
case O
for O
|
     | O
the O
prosecution O
, O
which O
was O
now O
being O
wound O
up O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
counsel O
for O
the O
prisoner O
had O
avoided O
much O
cross O
- O
examination O
, O
reserving O
to O
himself O
the O
|
     | O
right O
of O
calling O
the O
witnesses O
forward O
again O
  O
for O
he O
had O
received O
so O
little O
, O
and O
such O
vague O
|
     | O
instructions O
, O
and O
understood O
that O
so O
much O
depended O
on O
the O
evidence O
of O
one O
who O
was O
not O
|
     | O
forthcoming O
, O
that O
in O
fact O
he O
had O
little O
hope O
of O
establishing O
any O
thing O
like O
a O
show O
of O
a O
|
     | O
defence O
, O
and O
contented O
himself O
with O
watching O
the O
case O
, O
and O
lying O
in O
wait O
for O
any O
legal O
|
     | O
objections O
that O
might O
offer O
themselves O
. O
He O
lay O
back O
on O
the O
seat O
, O
occasionally O
taking O
a O
pinch O
of O
|
     | O
snuff O
in O
a O
manner O
intended O
to O
be O
contemptuous O
  O
now O
and O
then O
elevating O
his O
eyebrows O
, O
and O
|
     | O
sometimes O
exchanging O
a O
little O
note O
with O
Mr. O
Bridgenorth B-PERSON
behind O
him O
. O
The O
attorney O
had O
far O
more O
|
     | O
interest O
in O
the O
case O
than O
the O
barrister O
, O
to O
which O
he O
was O
perhaps O
excited O
by O
his O
poor O
old O
friend O

     | O
Job B-PERSON
Legh I-PERSON
  O
who O
had O
edged O
and O
wedged O
himself O
through O
the O
crowd O
close O
to O
Mr. O
Bridgenorth B-PERSON
's O
elbow O
, O

     | O
sent O
thither O
by O
Ben B-PERSON
Sturgis I-PERSON
, O
to O
whom O
he O
had O
been O
" O
introduced O
" O
by O
Charley B-PERSON
Jones I-PERSON
, O
and O
who O
had O

     | O
accounted O
for O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
disappearance O
on O
the B-DATE
preceding I-DATE

spoken O

their O

     | O
fears O
, O
their O
hopes O

  | O
All O
this O
was O
told O
in O
a O
few O
words O
to O
Mr. O
Bridgenorth B-PERSON
— O
so O
few O
, O
that O
they O
gave O
him O
but O
a O
confused O
|
     | O
idea O
, O
that O
time O
was O
of O
value O
  O
and O
this O
he O
named O
to O
his O
counsel O
, O
who O
now O
rose O
to O
speak O
for O
the O

  | O
Job B-PERSON
Legh I-PERSON
looked O
about O
for O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
now O
he O
had O
gained O
, O
and O
given O
, O
some O
idea O
of O
the O
position O
of O
|
     | O
things O
. O
At O
last O
he O
saw O
her O
, O
standing O
by O
a O
decent O
- O
looking O
woman O
, O
looking O
flushed O
and O
anxious O
, O
|
     | O
and O
moving O
her O
lips O
incessantly O
, O
as O
if O
eagerly O
talking O
  O
her O
eyes O
never O
resting O
on O
any O
object O
, O
|
     | O
but O
wandering O
about O
as O
if O
in O
search O
of O
something O
. O
Job O
thought O
it O
was O
for O
him O
she O
was O
seeking O
, O
|
     | O
and O
he O
struggled O
to O
get O
round O
to O
her O
. O
When O
he O
had O
succeeded O
, O
she O
took O
no O
notice O
of O
him O
, O
|
     | O
although O
he O
spoke O
to O
her O
, O
but O
still O
kept O
looking O
round O
and O
round O
in O
the O
same O
wild O
, O
restless O
|
     | O
manner O
. O
He O
tried O
to O
hear O
the O
low O
quick O
mutterings O
of O
her O
voice O
, O
as O
he O
caught O
the O
repetition O
of O
|
     | O
the O
same O
words O
over O
and O
over O
again O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
must O
not O
go O
mad O
. O
I O
must O
not O
, O
indeed O
. O
They O
say O
people O
tell O
the O
truth O
when O
they O
're O
mad O
  O
but O
|
     | O
I O
do O
n't O
. O
I O
was O
always O
a O
liar O
. O
I O
was O
, O
indeed O
  O
but O
I O
'm O
not O
mad O

I O

not O

mad O
. O
I O
must O

|
     | O
indeed O

" O
| 
  | O
Suddenly O
she O
seemed O
to O
become O
aware O
how O
earnestly O
Job O
was O
listening O
( O
with O
mournful O
attention O
) O
|
     | O
to O
her O
words O
, O
and O
turning O
sharp O
round O
upon O
him O
, O
with O
upbraiding O
for O
his O
eaves O
- O
dropping O
on O
her O
|
     | O
lips O
, O
she O
caught O
sight O
of O
something,—or B-DATE
some O
one,—who B-PERSON
, O
even O
in O
that O
state O
, O
had O
power O
to O
arrest O
|
     | O
her O
attention O
, O
and O
throwing O
up O
her O
arms O
with O
wild O
energy O
, O
she O
shrieked O
aloud O
, O
| 
  | O
" O
Oh O
, O
Jem B-PERSON
! O
Jem B-PERSON
! O
you O
're O
saved O
  O
and O
I O
|  | O
am O
|  | O
mad O
— O
" O
and O
was O
instantly O
seized O
with O
|
     | O
convulsions O
. O
With O
much O
commiseration O
she O
was O
taken O
out O
of O
court O
, O
while O
the O
attention O
of O
many O
|
     | O
was O
diverted O
from O
her O
, O
by O
the O
fierce O
energy O
with O
which O
a O
sailor O
forced O
his O
way O
over O
rails O
and O
|
     | O
seats O
, O
against O
turnkeys O
and O
policemen O
. O
The O
officers O
of O
the O
court O
opposed O
this O
forcible O
manner O
|
     | O
of O
entrance O
, O
but O
they O
could O
hardly O
induce O
the O
offender O
to O
adopt O
any O
quieter O
way O
of O
attaining O
|
     | O
his O
object O
, O
and O
telling O
his O
tale O
in O
the O
witness O
- O
box O
, O
the O
legitimate O
place O
. O
For O
Will O
had O
dwelt O
|
     | O
so O
impatiently O
on O
the O
danger O
in O
which O
his O
absence O
would O
place O
his O
cousin O
, O
that O
even O
yet O
he O
|
     | O
seemed O
to O
fear O
that O
he O
might O
see O
the O
prisoner O
carried O
off O
, O
and O
hung O
, O
before O
he O
could O
pour O
out O
|
     | O
the O
narrative O
which O
would O
exculpate O
him O
. O
As O
for O
Job B-PERSON
Legh I-PERSON
, O
his O
feelings O
were O
all O
but O
|
     | O
uncontrollable O
  O
as O
you O
may O
judge O
by O
the O
indifference O
with O
which O
he O
saw O
Mary B-PERSON
borne O
, O
stiff O
and O
|
     | O
convulsed O
, O
out O
of O
the O
court O
, O
in O
the O
charge O
of O
the O
kind O
Mrs. O
Sturgis B-PERSON
, O
who O
, O
you O
will O
remember O

keep O

not O
trouble O
myself O
about O
her O

said O
he O
to O
himself O
, O
as O
he O
wrote O
with O
|
     | O
trembling O
hands O
a O
little O
note O
of O
information O
to O
Mr. O

conjectured O

arrived O
( O
better O
late O

never O

on O

remaining O

to O

long O

     | O
before O
Job B-PERSON
Legh I-PERSON

almost O
illegible O
note O
was O
poked O
at O
him O

he O
had O
recapitulated O
the O
facts O
on O

The O
barrister O

of O
whose O
innocence O

     | O
he O
was O
still O
doubtful O

was O
shaken O

disturbed O
in O
a O
very O
uncomfortable O

were O
almost O
grateful O

     | O
to O
the O

the O

when O
he O
got O
up O

a O
brow O

to O
demolish O
the O

     | O

was O
so O

But O
if O
such O

without O
looking O

the O
first B-ORDINAL

feeling O
of O
some O
among O

how O

describe O
the O
vehemence O

possessed O
the O
mind O
of O
poor O

the O

Jem B-PERSON

Job B-PERSON

he O
might O

so O
much O
that O

I O

From O
that O

Jem B-PERSON
became O
aware O
that O
his O

     | O
mother O
was O
jealously O
watching O
for O
some O
word O
or O
sign O
which O
should O
betoken O
his O
wish O

     | O

And O
yet O
go O
to O
Liverpool B-GPE
he O
must O
and O
would O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
funeral O
was O
over O
, O
if O
but O
for O
a O

     | O
single O
glimpse O
of O
his O
darling O

For O
Job B-PERSON
had O
never O
written O
  O
indeed O
, O
any O
necessity O
for O
his O
so O

     | O
doing O
had O
never O
entered O
his O
head O

If O
Mary B-PERSON
died O
, O
he O
would O
announce O
it O
personally O
  O
if O
she O

     | O
recovered O
, O
he O
meant O
to O
bring O
her O
home O
with O
him O
. O
Writing O
was O
to O
him O
little O
more O
than O
an O

     | O
auxiliary O
to O
natural O
history O
  O
a O
way O
of O
ticketing O

of O

The O
consequence O
of O
this O
want O
of O
intelligence O
as O
to O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
state O
was O
, O
that O
Jem B-PERSON
was O
constantly O
|
     | O
anticipating O
that O
every O
person O
and O
every O
scrap O
of O
paper O
was O
to O
convey O
to O
him O
the O
news O
of O
her O

     | O
death O
. O
He O
could O
not O
endure O
this O
state O
long O
  O
but O
he O
resolved O
not O
to O
disturb O
the O
house O
by O

     | O
announcing O
to O
his O
mother O
his O
purposed O
intention O
of O
returning O
to O
Liverpool B-GPE

until O
the O

On O
Sunday B-DATE
afternoon B-TIME

laid O
her O
low O
with O
many O
tears O

as O
one O
who O
would O
not O
be O

     | O
comforted O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
old O
childish O
feeling O
came O
over O
him O
, O
the O
feeling O
of O
loneliness O
at O
being O
left O
among O
|
     | O
strangers O
. O
| 
  | O
By O
and O
bye O
, O
Margaret B-PERSON
timidly O
stole O
near O
him O
, O
as O
if O
waiting O
to O
console O
  O
and O
soon O
his O
passion O
|
     | O
sank O
down O
to O
grief O
, O
and O
grief O
gave O
way O
to O
melancholy O
, O
and O
though O
he O
felt O
as O
if O
he O
never O
could O
|
     | O
be O
joyful O
again O
, O
he O
was O
all O

unconsciously O
approaching O
nearer O

the O
full O
happiness O
of O

     | O
calling O
Margaret B-PERSON
his O
own O

a O
golden O
thread O
was O
interwoven O
even O
now O
with O
the O
darkness O
of O
his O

     | O
sorrow O

Yet O
it O
was O
on O
his O
arm O
that O
Jane B-PERSON
Wilson I-PERSON
leant O
on O
her O
return O
homewards O

a O
woman O
about O

knows O

some O
little O
self O

proposition O

not O
at O
all O

He O
found O
he O

better O
speak O
out O

put O
his O
intention O

subterfuge O
about O

tell O

I O
that O

finishing O

It O
seems O
strange O

about O

made O
the O
only O
objection O

she O
did O
not O

this O

     | O
feeling O
to O
Jem B-PERSON

  | O
For O
an O
instant O
his O
mother O
was O
interested O
by O
his O
words O
  O
and O
then O
came O
back O
the O
old O
jealousy O
of O
|
     | O
being O
supplanted O
in O
the O
affections O
of O
that O
son O
, O
who O
had O
been O
, O
as O
it O
were O
, O
newly O
born O
to O
her O
, O
by O
|
     | O
the O
escape O
he O
had O
so O
lately O
experienced O
from O
danger O
. O
So O
she O
hardened O
her O
heart O
against O
|
     | O
entertaining O
any O
feeling O
of O
sympathy O
  O
and O
turned O
away O
from O
the O
face O
, O
which O
recalled O
the O
earnest O
|
     | O
look O
of O
his O
childhood O
, O
when O
he O
had O
come O
to O
her O
in O
some O
trouble O
, O
sure O
of O
help O
and O
comfort O
. O
| 
  | O
And O
coldly O
she O
spoke O
, O
in O
those O
tones O
which O
Jem B-PERSON
knew O
and O
dreaded O
, O
even O
before O
the O
meaning O
they O
|
     | O
expressed O
was O
fully O
shaped O
. O
" O

of O

felt O
as O

Jem B-PERSON
got O
up O
, O

walked O
about O
the O
room O
in O
despairing O
impatience O
. O
She O
would O
not O
understand O
his O

     | O
feelings O

At O
last O
he O
stopped O
right O
before O
the O
place O
where O
she O
was O
sitting O
, O
with O
an O
air O
of O

injured O
meekness O

up O

took O
another O

down O

She O
let O
him O
out O

bolted O

He O
stood O
on O
the O
steps O
to O
adjust O
some O

fastening O
about O

The O

Long O

all O
retired O

evening B-TIME

The O

shone O
down O
on O
the O
silent O
deserted O
streets O

and O

     | O
the O
soft O
clear O
moonlight O
fell O
in O
bright O
masses O
, O
leaving O
the O
steps O
on O
which O
Jem B-PERSON
stood O
in O

     | O
shadow O
. O
| 
  | O
A O
foot O
- O
fall O
was O
heard O
along O
the O
pavement O
  O
slow O
and O
heavy O
was O
the O
sound O
. O
Before O
Jem B-PERSON
had O
ended O

     | O
his O
little O
piece O
of O
business O
, O
a O
form O
had O
glided O
into O
sight O
  O
a O
wan O

feeble O
figure O

with O

     | O
evident O

painful O
labour O

a O
jug O

water O
from O

It O
went O
before O
Jem B-PERSON
, O

     | O
turned O
up O
the O
court O
at O
the O
corner O
of O
which O
he O
was O
standing O
, O
passed O
into O
the O
broad O

there O
, O
with O
bowed O
head O
, O
sinking O
and O
shrunk O
body O
, O
Jem B-PERSON
recognised O
John B-PERSON
Barton I-PERSON

| 
  | O
No O
haunting O
ghost O
could O
have O
had O
less O
of O
the O
energy O
of O
life O
in O
its O
involuntary O
motions O
than O
|
     | O
he O
, O
who O
, O
nevertheless O
, O
went O
on O
with O
the O
same O
measured O
clock O
- O
work O
tread O
until O
the O
door O
of O
his O
|
     | O
own O
house O
was O
reached O
. O
And O
then O
he O
disappeared O
, O
and O
the O
latch O
fell O
feebly O
to O
, O
and O
made O
a O
faint O

     | O
and O
wavering O
sound O
, O
breaking O
the O
solemn O
silence O
of O
the O
night O
. O
Then O
all O
again O
was O
still O
. O

  | O
For O
a B-TIME
minute I-TIME
or O
two B-CARDINAL
Jem B-PERSON
stood O
motionless O
, O
stunned O
by O
the O
thoughts O
which O
the O
sight O
of O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
|
     | O
father O
had O
called O
up O
. O
| 
  | O
Margaret B-PERSON
did O
not O
know O
he O
was O
at O
home O
: O
had O
he O
stolen O
like O
a O
thief O
by O
dead O
of O
night B-TIME
into O
his O
|
     | O
own O
dwelling O
? O
Depressed O
as O
Jem B-PERSON
had O
often O
and O
long O
seen O
him O
, O
this B-TIME
night I-TIME
there O
was O
something O
|
     | O
different O
about O
him O
still O
  O
beaten O
down O
by O
some O
inward O
storm O
, O
he O
seemed O
to O
grovel O
along O
, O
all O
|
     | O
self O
- O
respect O
lost O
and O
gone O
. O
| 
  | O
Must O
he O
be O
told O
of O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
state O
? O
Jem B-PERSON
felt O
he O
must O
not O
  O
and O
this O
for O
many O
reasons O
. O
He O
could O
|
     | O
not O
be O
informed O
of O
her O
illness O
without O
many O
other O
particulars O
being O
communicated O
at O
the O
same O
|
     | O
time O
, O
of O
which O
it O
were O
better O
he O
should O
be O
kept O
in O
ignorance O
  O
indeed O
, O
of O
which O
Mary B-PERSON
herself O
|
     | O
could O
alone O
give O
the O
full O
explanation O
. O
No O
suspicion O
that O
he O
was O
the O
criminal O
seemed O
hitherto O
to O
|
     | O
have O
been O
excited O
in O
the O
mind O
of O
any O
one O
. O
Added O
to O
these O
reasons O
was O
Jem B-PERSON
's O
extreme O
|
     | O
unwillingness O
to O
face O
him O
, O
with O
the O
belief O
in O
his O
breast O
that O
he O
, O
and O
none O
other O
, O
had O
done O
the O
|
     | O
fearful O
deed O
. O
| 
  | O
It O
was O
true O
that O
he O
was O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
father O
, O
and O
as O
such O
had O
every O
right O
to O
be O
told O
of O
all O
|
     | O
concerning O
her O
  O
but O
supposing O
he O
were O
, O
and O
that O
he O
followed O
the O
impulse O
so O
natural O
to O
a O
father O
, O
|
     | O
and O
wished O
to O
go O
to O
her O
, O
what O
might O
be O
the O
consequences O
? O
Among O
the O
mingled O
feelings O
she O
had O
|
     | O
revealed O
in O
her O
delirium O
, O
ay O
, O
mingled O
even O
with O
the O
most O
tender O
expressions O
of O
love O
for O
her O
|
     | O
father O
, O
was O
a O
sort O
of O
horror O
of O
him O
  O
a O
dread O
of O
him O
as O
a O
blood O
- O
shedder O
, O
which O
seemed O
to O
|
     | O
separate O
him O
into O
two B-CARDINAL
persons,—one O
, O
the O
father O
who O
had O
dandled O
her O
on O
his O
knee O
, O
and O
loved O
her O
|
     | O
all O
her O
life O
long O
  O
the O
other O
, O
the O
assassin O
, O
the O
cause O
of O
all O
her O
trouble O
and O
woe O
. O
| 
  | O
If O
he O
presented O
himself O
before O
her O
while O
this O
idea O
of O
his O
character O
was O
uppermost O
, O
who O
might O
|
     | O
tell O
the O
consequence O
? O
| 
  | O
Jem B-PERSON
could O
not O
, O
and O
would O
not O
, O
expose O
her O
to O
any O
such O
fearful O
chance O
: O
and O
to O
tell O
the O
truth O
, O
I O
|
     | O
believe O
he O
looked O
upon O
her O
as O
more O
his O
own O
, O
to O
guard O
from O
all O
shadow O
of O
injury O
with O
most O
loving O

any O

Mary B-PERSON
still O
hovered O
between O
life O
and O
death O
when O
Jem B-PERSON
arrived O
at O
the O
house O
where O
she O
lay O
  O
and O
|
     | O
the O
doctors O
were O
as O
yet O
unwilling O
to O
compromise O
their O
wisdom O
by O
allowing O
too O
much O

But O
the O
state O
of O
things O
, O
if O
not O
less O
anxious O
, O
was O
less O
distressing O
than O
when O
Jem B-PERSON
|
     | O
had O
quitted O
her O
. O
She O
lay O
now O
in O
a O
stupor O
, O
which O
was O
partly O
disease O
, O
and O
partly O
exhaustion O
after O
|
     | O
the O
previous O
excitement O
. O
| 
  | O
And O
now O
Jem B-PERSON
found O
the O
difficulty O
which O
every O
one O
who O
has O
watched O
by O
a O
sick O
bed O
knows O
full O
|
     | O
well O
  O
and O
which O
is O
perhaps O
more O
insurmountable O
to O
men O
than O
it O
is O
to O
women,—the O
difficulty O
of O
|
     | O
being O
patient O
, O
and O
trying O
not O
to O
expect O
any O
visible O
change O
for O
long O
, O
long O
hours O
of O
sad O

monotony O

But O
after O
awhile O
the O
reward O
came O
. O
The O
laboured O
breathing O
became O
lower O
and O
softer O
, O
the O
heavy O
|
     | O
look O
of O
oppressive O
pain O
melted O
away O
from O
the O
face O
, O
and O
a O
languor O
that O
was O
almost O
peace O
took O
the O

     | O
place O
of O
suffering O

spoke O
low O

     | O
and O
softly O
, O
and O
hardly O
dared O
to O
breathe O
, O
however O
much O
they O
longed O
to O
sigh O
out O
their O
thankful O
|
     | O
relief O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
opened O
her O
eyes O
. O
Her O
mind O
was O
in O
the O
tender O
state O
of O
a O
lately O
- O
born O
infant O
's O
. O
She O
was O
|
     | O
pleased O
with O
the O
gay O
but O
not O
dazzling O
colours O
of O
the O
paper O
  O
soothed O
by O
the O
subdued O
light O
  O
and O
|
     | O
quite O
sufficiently O
amused O
by O
looking O
at O
all O
the O
objects O
in O
the O
room,—the O
drawing O
of O
the O
ships O
, O
|
     | O
the O
festoons O
of O
the O
curtain O
, O
the O
bright O
flowers O
on O
the O
painted O
backs O
of O
the O
chairs,—to B-ORG
care O
for O
|
     | O
any O
stronger O
excitement O
. O
She O
wondered O
at O
the O
ball O
of O
glass O
, O
containing O
various O
coloured O
sands O
|
     | O
from O
the B-GPE
Isle I-GPE
of I-GPE
Wight I-GPE
, O
or O
some O
such O
place O
, O
which O
hung O
suspended O
from O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
little O
|
     | O
valance O
over O
the O
window O
. O
But O
she O
did O
not O
care O
to O
exert O
herself O
to O
ask O
any O
questions O
, O
although O
|
     | O
she O
saw O
Mrs. O
Sturgis B-PERSON
standing O
at O
the O
bed O
- O
side O
with O
some O
tea O
, O
ready O
to O
drop O
it O
into O
her O
mouth O
by O
|
     | O
spoonfuls O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
did O
not O
see O
the O
face O
of O
honest O
joy O
, O
of O
earnest O
thankfulness,—the O
clasped O
hands,—the O
|
     | O
beaming O
eyes,—the O
trembling O
eagerness O
of O
gesture O
, O
of O
one O
who O
had O
long O
awaited O
her O
awakening O
, O
|
     | O
and O
who O
now O
stood O
behind O
the O
curtains O
watching O
through O
some O
little O
chink O
her O
every O
faint O
|
     | O
motion O
  O
or O
if O
she O
had O
caught O
a O
glimpse O
of O
that O
loving O
, O
peeping O
face O
, O
she O
was O
in O
too O
exhausted O
a O
|
     | O
state O
to O
have O
taken O
much O
notice O
, O
or O
have O
long O
retained O
the O
impression O
that O
he O
she O
loved O
so O
well O
|
     | O
was O
hanging O
about O
her O
, O
and O
blessing O
God O
for O
every O
conscious O
look O
which O
stole O
over O
her O
|
     | O
countenance O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
fell O
softly O
into O
slumber O
, O
without O
a O
word O
having O
been O
spoken O
by O
any O
one O
during O
that B-TIME
half I-TIME
|
     | I-TIME
hour I-TIME
of O
inexpressible O
joy O
. O
And O
again O
the O
stillness O
was O
enforced O
by O
sign O
and O
whispered O
word O
, O
but O
|
     | O
with O
eyes O
that O
beamed O
out O
their O
bright O
thoughts O
of O
hope O
. O
Jem B-PERSON
sat O
by O
the O
side O
of O
the O
bed O
, O
|
     | O
holding O
back O
the O
little O
curtain O
, O
and O
gazing O
as O
if O
he O
could O
never O
gaze O
his O
fill O
at O
the O
pale O
, O
|
     | O
wasted O
face O
, O
so O
marbled O
and O
so O
chiselled O
in O
its O
wan O
outline O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
wakened O
once O
more O
  O
her O
soft O
eyes O
opened O
, O
and O
met O
his O
over O
- O
bending O
look O
. O
She O
smiled O
|
     | O
gently O
, O
as O
a O
baby O
does O
when O
it O
sees O
its O
mother O
tending O
its O
little O
cot O
  O
and O
continued O
her O
|
     | O
innocent O
, O
infantine O
gaze O
into O
his O
face O
, O
as O
if O
the O
sight O
gave O
her O
much O
unconscious O
pleasure O
. O
But O
|
     | O
by O
- O
and O
- O
by O
a O
different O
expression O
came O
into O
her O
sweet O
eyes O
  O
a O
look O
of O
memory O
and O
intelligence O
  O
|
     | O
her O
white O
face O
flushed O
the O
brightest O
rosy O
red O
, O
and O
with O
feeble O
motion O
she O
tried O
to O
hide O
her O
|
     | O
head O
in O
the O
pillow O
. O
| 
  | O
It O
required O
all O
Jem B-PERSON
's O
self O
- O
control O
to O
do O
what O
he O
knew O
and O
felt O
to O
be O
necessary O
, O
to O
call O
Mrs. O
|
     | O
Sturgis B-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
quietly O
dozing O
by O
the O
fireside O
  O
and O
that O
done O
, O
he O
felt O
almost O
obliged O
to O
leave O
|
     | O
the O
room O
to O
keep O
down O
the O
happy O
agitation O
which O
would O
gush O
out O
in O
every O
feature O
, O
every O
gesture O
, O
|
     | O
and O
every O
tone O
. O
| 
  | O
From O
that O
time O
forward O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
progress O
towards O
health O
was O
rapid O
. O
| 
  | O
There O
was O
every O
reason O
, O
but O
one O
, O
in O
favour O
of O
her O
speedy O
removal O
home O
. O
All O
Jem B-PERSON
's O
duties O
lay O
|
     | O
in O
Manchester B-GPE
. O
It O
was O
his O
mother O
's O
dwelling O
- O
place O
, O
and O
there O
his O
plans O
for O
life O
had O
been O
to O
be O
|
     | O
worked O
out O
  O
plans O
, O
which O
the O
suspicion O
and O
imprisonment O
he O
had O
fallen O
into O
, O
had O
thrown O
for O
a O
|
     | O
time O
into O
a O
chaos O
, O
which O
his O
presence O
was O
required O
to O
arrange O
into O
form O
. O
For O
he O
might O
find O
, O
in O
|
     | O
spite O
of O
a O
jury O
's O
verdict O
, O
that O
too O
strong O
a O
taint O
was O
on O
his O
character O
for O
him O
ever O
to O
labour O
|
     | O
in O
Manchester B-GPE
again O
. O
He O
remembered O
the O
manner O
in O
which O
some O
one O
suspected O
of O
having O
been O
a O
|
     | O
convict O
was O
shunned O
by O
masters O
and O
men O
, O
when O
he O
had O
accidentally O
met O
with O
work O
in O
their O
|
     | O
foundry O
  O
the O
recollection O
smote O
him O
now O
, O
how O
he O
himself O
had O
thought O
that O
it O
did O
not O
become O
an O
|
     | O
honest O
upright O
man O
to O
associate O
with O
one O
who O
had O
been O
a O
prisoner O
. O
He O
could O
not O
choose O
but O
think O
|
     | O
on O
that O
poor O
humble O
being O
, O
with O
his O
downcast O
conscious O
look O
  O
hunted O
out O
of O
the O
work O
- O
shop O
, O
where O
|
     | O
he O
had O
sought O
to O
earn O
an O
honest O
livelihood O
, O
by O
the O
looks O
, O
and O
half B-CARDINAL
- O
spoken O
words O
, O
and O
the O
black O
|
     | O
silence O
of O
repugnance O
( O
worse O
than O
words O
to O
bear O
) O
, O
that O
met O
him O
on O
all O
sides O
. O
| 
  | O
Jem B-PERSON
felt O
that O
his O
own O
character O
had O
been O
attainted O
  O
and O
that O
to O
many O
it O
might O
still O
appear O
|
     | O
suspicious O
. O
He O
knew O
that O
he O
could O
convince O
the O
world O
, O
by O
a O
future O
as O
blameless O
as O
his O
past O
had O
|
     | O
been O
, O
that O
he O
was O
innocent O
. O
But O
at O
the O
same O
time O
he O
saw O
that O
he O
must O
have O
patience O
, O
and O
nerve O
|
     | O
himself O
for O
some O
trials O
  O
and O
the O
sooner O
these O
were O
undergone O
, O
the O
sooner O
he O
was O
aware O
of O
the O
|
     | O
place O
he O
held O
in O
men O
's O
estimation O
, O
the O
better O
. O
He O
longed O
to O
have O
presented O
himself O
once O
more O
at O
|
     | O
the O
foundry O
  O
and O
then O
the O
reality O
would O
drive O
away O
the O
pictures O
that O
would O
( O
unbidden O
) O
come O
of O
a O
|
     | O
shunned O
man O
, O
eyed O
askance O
by O
all O
, O
and O
driven O
forth O
to O
shape O
out O
some O
new O
career O
. O
| 
  | O
I O
said O
every O
reason O
" O
but O
one O
" O
inclined O
Jem B-PERSON
to O
hasten O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
return O
as O
soon O
as O
she O
was O
|
     | O
sufficiently O
convalescent O
. O
That O
one O
was O
the O
meeting O
which O
awaited O
her O
at O
home O
. O
| 
  | O
Turn O
it O
over O
as O
Jem B-PERSON
would O
, O
he O
could O
not O
decide O
what O
was O
the O
best O
course O
to O
pursue O
. O
He O
could O
|
     | O
compel O
himself O
to O
any O
line O
of O
conduct O
that O
his O
reason O
and O
his O
sense O
of O
right O
told O
him O
to O
be O
|
     | O
desirable O
  O
but O
they O
did O
not O
tell O
him O
it O
was O
desirable O
to O
speak O
to O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
in O
her O
tender O
state O
of O
|
     | O
mind O
and O
body O
, O
of O
her O
father O
. O
How O
much O
would O
be O
implied O
by O
the O
mere O
mention O
of O
his O
name O
! O
Speak O
|
     | O
it O
as O
calmly O
, O
and O
as O
indifferently O
as O
he O
might O
, O
he O
could O
not O
avoid O
expressing O
some O
|
     | O
consciousness O
of O
the O
terrible O
knowledge O
she O
possessed O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
, O
for O
her O
part O
, O
was O
softer O
and O
gentler O
than O
she O
had O
ever O
been O
in O
her O
gentlest O
mood O
  O
since O
|
     | O
her O
illness O
, O
her O
motions O
, O
her O
glances O
, O
her O
voice O
were O
all O
tender O
in O
their O
languor O
. O
It O
seemed O
|
     | O
almost O
a O
trouble O
to O
her O
to O
break O
the O
silence O
with O
the O
low O
sounds O
of O
her O
own O
sweet O
voice O
, O
and O
|
     | O
her O
words O
fell O
sparingly O
on O
Jem B-PERSON
's O
greedy O
, O
listening O
ear O
. O
| 
  | O
Her O
face O
was O
, O
however O
, O
so O
full O
of O
love O
and O
confidence O
, O
that O
Jem B-PERSON
felt O
no O
uneasiness O
at O
the O
|
     | O
state O
of O
silent O
abstraction O
into O
which O
she O
often O
fell O
. O
If O
she O
did O
but O
love O
him O
, O
all O
would O
yet O
|
     | O
go O
right O
  O
and O
it O
was O
better O
not O
to O
press O
for O
confidence O
on O
that O
one B-CARDINAL
subject O
which O
must O
be O
|
     | O
painful O
to O
both O
. O
| 
  | O
There O
came O
a O
fine O
, O
bright O
, O
balmy O
day O
. O
And O
Mary B-PERSON
tottered O
once O
more O
out O
into O
the O
open O
air O
, O
|
     | O
leaning O
on O
Jem B-PERSON
's O
arm O
, O
and O
close O
to O
his O
beating O
heart O
. O
And O
Mrs. O
Sturgis B-PERSON
watched O
them O
from O
her O
|
     | O
door O
, O
with O
a O
blessing O
on O
her O
lips O
, O
as O
they O
went O
slowly O
up O
the O
street O
. O
| 
  | O
They O
came O
in O
sight O
of O
the O
river O
. O
Mary B-PERSON
shuddered O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Oh O
, O
Jem B-PERSON
! O
take O
me O
home O
. O
Yon O
river O
seems O
all O
made O
of O
glittering O
, O
heaving O
, O
dazzling O
metal O
, O
just O
|
     | O
as O
it O
did O
when O
I O
began O
to O
be O
ill O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Jem B-PERSON
led O
her O
homewards O
. O
She O
dropped O
her O
head O
as O
searching O
for O
something O
on O
the O
ground O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Jem B-PERSON
! O
" O
He O
was O
all O
attention O
. O
She O
paused O
for O
an O
instant O
. O
" O
When O
may O
I O
go O
home O
? O
To O
Manchester B-ORG
, O
I O

     | O
mean O

I O
am O
so O
weary O
of O
this O
place O
  O
and O
I O
would O
fain O
be O
at O
home O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
She O
spoke O
in O
a O
feeble O
voice O
  O
not O
at O
all O
impatiently O
, O
as O
the O
words O
themselves O
would O
seem O
to O
|
     | O
intimate O
, O
but O
in O
a O
mournful O
way O
, O
as O
if O
anticipating O
sorrow O
even O
in O
the O
very O
fulfilment O
of O
her O

     | O
wishes O

" O
Darling O

we O
will O
go O

hung O
about O

went O
to O
Mary B-PERSON

Jem I-PERSON
, O

his O

in O
succession O
, O
pouring O
out O
a O
glass O
for O

bidding O
them O
drink O
it O
to O
keep O
their O
spirits O
up O
: O
but O
as O
each O
severally O
refused O
, O
he O

     | O
drank O
it O
himself O
  O

passed O
on O
to O
offer O
the O

another O

like O
refusal O

When O
he O
had O
swallowed O
the O
last O
of O
the O
three B-CARDINAL

he O
condescended O

his O
reasons O

having O
done O
so O

replaced O

It O
was O
he O
who O
in O
a O
firm O
commanding O
voice O
at O

told O

no O

aloud O

" O
Perhaps O

" O
exclaimed O
she O
, O
with O
a O
degree O
of O
hope O

Time B-PERSON

back O

with O
some O
more O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
When O
they O
reached O
Manchester B-ORG
, O
Mary B-PERSON
looked O
very O
white O
, O
and O
the O
expression O
on O
her O
face O
was O
|
     | O
almost O
stern O
. O
She O
was O
in O
fact O
summoning O
up O
her O
resolution O
to O
meet O
her O
father O
if O
he O
were O
at O
|
     | O
home O
. O
Jem B-PERSON
had O
never O
named O
his O
midnight O
glimpse O
of O
John B-PERSON
Barton I-PERSON
to O
human O
being O
  O
but O
Mary B-PERSON
had O
a O
|
     | O
sort O
of O
presentiment O
that O
wander O
where O
he O
would O
, O
he O
would O
seek O
his O
home O
at O
last O

But O
in O
what O

     | O
mood O
she O
dreaded O
to O
think O
. O
For O
the O
knowledge O
of O
her O
father O
's O
capability O
of O
guilt O
seemed O
to O
have O
|
     | O
opened O
a O
dark O
gulf O
in O
his O
character O
, O
into O
the O
depths O
of O
which O
she O
trembled O
to O
look O
. O
At O
one B-CARDINAL
|
     | O
moment O
she O
would O
fain O
have O
claimed O
protection O
against O
the O
life O

must O
lead O
, O
for O
some O
time O
at O
|
     | O
least O
, O
alone O
with O
a O
murderer O
! O
She O
thought O
of O
his O
gloom O
, O
before O
his O
mind O
was O
haunted O
by O
the O
|
     | O
memory O
of O
so O
terrible O
a O
crime O
  O
his O
moody O
, O
irritable O
ways O

She O
imagined O
the O
evenings O
as O
of O
old O
: O

     | O
she O
, O
toiling O
at O
some O
work O

long O
after O

shut O

folks O
abed O
  O
he O
, O
more O
savage O
than O
he O

     | O
had O
ever O
been O
before O
with O
the O
inward O
gnawing O
of O
his O
remorse O
. O
At O
such O
times O
she O
could O
have O
cried O

     | O
aloud O
with O
terror O
, O
at O
the O
scenes O
her O
fancy O
conjured O
up O
. O

But O
her O
filial O
duty O
, O
nay O
, O
her O
love O

gratitude O
for O
many O
deeds O
of O
kindness O
done O
to O
her O
as O
a O
|
     | O
little O
child O
, O
conquered O
all O
fear O

She O
would O
endure O
all O
imaginable O
terrors O
, O
although O
of O
daily O

     | O
occurrence O

And O
she O
would O
patiently O
bear O
all O
wayward O
violence O
of O
temper O
  O
more O
than O
patiently O

     | O
would O
she O
bear O
it O

pitifully O

as O
one O
who O
knew O
of O
some O
awful O
curse O
awaiting O
the O
blood O

would O
watch O

I O

I O

all O

But O
this O

If O

Jem B-PERSON
, O
you O
promised O
— O
" O

  | O
And O
so O
saying O
she O
left O
him O
. O
She O
went O
quicker O
than O
she O
would O
otherwise O
have O
passed O
over O
those O
|
     | O
few O
yards O
of O
ground O
, O
for O
fear O
he O
should O
still O
try O
to O
accompany O
her O
. O
Her O
hand O
was O
on O
the O
latch O
, O
|
     | O
and O
in O
a O
breath O
the O
door O
was O
opened O
. O
| 
  | O
There O
sat O
her O
father O
, O
still O
and O
motionless O
— O
not O
even O
turning O
his O
head O
to O
see O
who O
had O
entered O
  O
|
     | O
but O
perhaps O
he O
recognised O
the O
foot O
- O
step,—the O
trick O
of O
action O
. O
| 
  | O
He O
sat O
by O
the O
fire O
  O
the O
grate O
I O
should O
say O
, O
for O
fire O
there O
was O
none O
. O
Some O
dull O
, O
gray O
ashes O
, O
|
     | O
negligently O
left O
, O
long B-DATE
days I-DATE
ago I-DATE
, O
coldly O
choked O
up O
the O
bars O
. O
He O
had O
taken O
the O
accustomed O
seat O
|
     | O
from O
mere O
force O
of O
habit O
, O
which O
ruled O
his O
automaton O
- O
body O
. O
For O
all O
energy O
, O
both O
physical O
and O
|
     | O
mental O
, O
seemed O
to O
have O
retreated O
inwards O
to O
some O
of O
the O
great O
citadels O
of O
life O
, O
there O
to O
do O
|
     | O
battle O
against O
the O
Destroyer B-ORG
, O
Conscience B-PRODUCT
. O
| 
  | O
His O
hands O
were O
crossed O
, O
his O
fingers O
interlaced O
  O
usually O
a O
position O
implying O
some O
degree O
of O
|
     | O
resolution O
, O
or O
strength O
  O
but O
in O
him O
it O
was O
so O
faintly O
maintained O
, O
that O
it O
appeared O
more O
the O
|
     | O
result O
of O
chance O
  O
an O
attitude O
requiring O
some O
application O
of O
outward O
force O
to O
alter,—and O
a O
blow O
|
     | O
with O
a O
straw O
seemed O
as O
though O
it O
would O
be O
sufficient O
. O
| 
  | O
And O
as O
for O
his O
face O
, O
it O
was O
sunk O
and O
worn,—like O
a O
skull O
, O
with O
yet O
a O
suffering O
expression O
that O
|
     | O
skulls O
have O
not O
! O
Your O
heart O
would O
have O
ached O
to O
have O
seen O
the O
man O
, O
however O
hardly O
you O
might O
|
     | O
have O
judged O
his O
crime O
. O
| 
  | O
But O
crime O
and O
all O
was O
forgotten O
by O
his O
daughter O
, O
as O
she O
saw O
his O
abashed O
look O
, O
his O
smitten O
|
     | O
helplessness O
. O
All O
along O
she O
had O
felt O
it O
difficult O
( O
as O
I O
may O
have O
said O
before O
) O
to O
reconcile O
the O
|
     | O
two B-CARDINAL
ideas O
, O
of O
her O
father O
and O
a O
blood O
- O
shedder O
. O
But O
now O
it O
was O
impossible O
. O
He O
was O
her O
father O
! O
her O
|
     | O
own O
dear O
father O
! O
and O
in O
his O
sufferings O
, O
whatever O
their O
cause O
, O
more O
dearly O
loved O
than O
ever O
|
     | O
before O
. O
His O
crime O
was O
a O
thing O
apart O
, O
never O
more O
to O
be O
considered O
by O
her O
. O
| 
  | O
And O
tenderly O
did O
she O
treat O
him O
, O
and O
fondly O
did O
she O
serve O
him O
in O
every O
way O
that O
heart O
could O
|
     | O
devise O
, O
or O
hand O
execute O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
had O
some O
money O
about O
her O
, O
the O
price O
of O
her O
strange O
services O
as O
a O
witness O
  O
and O
when O
the O
|
     | O
lingering O
dusk O
drew O
on O
, O
she O
stole O
out O
to O
effect O
some O
purchases O
necessary O
for O
her O
father O
's O
|
     | O
comfort O
. O
| 
  | O
For O
how O
body O
and O
soul O
had O
been O
kept O
together O
, O
even O
as O
much O
as O
they O
were O
, O
during O
the B-DATE
days I-DATE
he O
|
     | O
had O
dwelt O
alone O
, O
no O
one O
can O
say O
. O
The O
house O
was O
bare O
as O
when O
Mary B-PERSON
had O
left O
it O
, O
of O
coal O

or O
of O

of O

of O
blessing O
in O
any O

She O
came O
quickly O
home O
  O
but O
as O
she O
passed O
Job B-PERSON

she O
stopped O

Doubtless O
Jem B-PERSON
had O
long O
|
     | O
since O
gone O
  O
and O
doubtless O
, O
too O
, O
he O
had O
given O
Margaret B-PERSON
some O
good O
reason O
for O
not O
intruding O
upon O

     | O
her O
friend O
for O
this B-TIME
night I-TIME

to O

she O
not O

her O
desire O

be O
once O

she O

  O
she O

could O

gently O
smiled O
into O
her O

Job B-PERSON
Legh I-PERSON
took O
the O
candle O
up O

began O
a O
leisurely O
inspection O

" O

For O
Mary B-PERSON
had O
sickened O
at O
the O
mention O

she O
moved O
about O
, O
avoided O
letting O
her O
eyes O
rest O
|
     | O
upon O
him O
. O
She O
wished O
to O
be O
her O
usual O
self O
  O
but O
while O
every O
thing O
was O
done O
with O
a O
consciousness O

     | O
of O
purpose O
, O
she O
felt O
it O
was O
impossible O
. O

  | O
In O
this O
manner O
things O
went O
on O
for O
some B-DATE
days I-DATE

At O
night B-TIME
he O
feebly O
clambered O
up O
stairs O
to O
bed O
  O
|
     | O
and O
during O
those O
long O
dark O
hours O
Mary B-PERSON
heard O
those O
groans O
of O
agony O
which O
never O
escaped O
his O
lips O
|
     | O
by O
day O
, O
when O
they O
were O
compressed O
in O
silence O
over O
his O
inward O
woe O
. O
| 
  | O
Many O
a O
time O
she O
sat O
up O
listening O
, O
and O
wondering O
if O
it O
would O
ease O
his O
miserable O
heart O
if O
she O
|
     | O
went O
to O
him O
, O
and O
told O
him O
she O
knew O
all O
, O
and O
loved O
and O
pitied O
him O
more O
than O
words O
could O

     | O
tell O
. O
| 
  | O
By O
day B-DATE
the B-TIME
monotonous I-TIME
hours I-TIME
wore O
on O
in O
the O
same O
heavy O
, O
hushed O
manner O
as O
on O
that O
first B-ORDINAL
dreary O
|
     | O
afternoon O
. O
He O
ate,—but O
without O
relish O
  O
and O
food O
seemed O
no O
longer O
to O
nourish O
him O
, O
for O
each O
|
     | O
morning O
his O
face O
had O
caught O
more O
of O
the O
ghastly O
fore O
- O
shadowing O
of O
Death B-GPE
. O

  | O
The O
neighbours O
kept O
strangely O
aloof O
. O
Of O
late B-DATE
years I-DATE
John B-PERSON
Barton I-PERSON
had O
had O
a O
repellent O
power O

     | O
about O
him O
, O
felt O
by O
all O
, O
except O
to O
the O
few O
who O

either O
known O
him O
in O
his O
better O

happier O

     | O
days O

or O
those O
to O
whom O
he O
had O
given O
his O
sympathy O

his O
confidence O

People O
did O
not O
care O
to O

     | O
enter O
the O
doors O
of O
one B-CARDINAL
whose O
very O
depth O
of O
thoughtfulness O
rendered O
him O
moody O
and O
stern O
. O
And O
now O
|
     | O
they O
contented O
themselves O
with O
a O
kind O
inquiry O
when O
they O
saw O
Mary B-PERSON
in O
her O
goings O
- O
out O
or O
in O
her O

     | O
comings O

in O
. O
With O
her O
oppressing O
knowledge O
, O
she O
imagined O
their O
reserved O
conduct O
stranger O
than O
it O

     | O
was O
in O
reality O
. O
She O
missed O
Job O

Margaret B-PERSON
too O
  O
who O
, O
in O
all O
former O
times O
of O
sorrow O

had O
been O
ready O
with O
their O
sympathy O

  | O
But O
most O
of O
all O
she O
missed O
the O
delicious O
luxury O
she O
had O
lately O
enjoyed O
in O
having O
Jem B-PERSON

love O
at O

every B-TIME

every O

     | O

| 
  | O
She O
knew O
he O
was O
often O
hovering O
about O
the O
house O
  O
though O
the O
knowledge O
seemed O
to O
come O
more O
by O

than O
by O
any O

for O
the B-DATE
first I-DATE
day I-DATE

On O
the B-DATE
third I-DATE
day I-DATE
she O

     | O
met O
him O
at O
Job B-PERSON
Legh I-PERSON

. O
| 
  | O
They O
received O
her O
with O
every O
effort O
of O
cordiality O
  O
but O
still O
there O
was O
a O
cobweb O
- O
veil O
of O
|
     | O
separation O
between O
them O
, O
to O
which O
Mary B-PERSON
was O
morbidly O
acute O
  O
while O
in O
Jem B-PERSON

voice O
, O
and O
eyes O
, O

     | O
manner O

every O
evidence O
of O
most O
passionate O
, O
most O
admiring O
, O
and O
most O
trusting O
love O
. O
The O
|
     | O
trust O
was O
shown O
by O
his O
respectful O
silence O
on O
that O
one B-CARDINAL
point O
of O
reserve O
on O
which O
she O
had O

     | O
interdicted O

He O

the O

sitting O
near O
the O
window O

sadly O

     | O
dreaming O
over O

caught O

of O
Sally B-PERSON

  O
another O
moment O

she O
tapped O
at O
the O
door O

John B-PERSON

     | I-PERSON
Barton I-PERSON
gave O
an O
anxious O

uneasy O
side O

glance O

Mary B-PERSON
knew O
that O
if O
she O
delayed O
answering O
the O
knock O
, O
|
     | O
Sally B-PERSON
would O
not O
scruple O
to O
enter O
  O
so O
as O
hastily O
as O
if O
the O
visit O

desired O
, O
she O
opened O

     | O
the O
door O

stood O
there O
with O
the O
latch O
in O
her O
hand O

barring O
up O
all O
entrance O

as O
much O
as O

     | O
possible O
obstructing O
all O

" O

step O
over O

hear O
the O

She O
was O
bent O
on O
coming O
in O
, O

saw O
Mary B-PERSON

preventive O
design O

So O
she O
stood O
on O
tip O
- O
toe O
, O
looking O

     | O
over O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
shoulders O
into O
the O
room O
where O
she O
suspected O
a O
lover O
to O
be O
lurking O
  O
but O
instead O
, O
she O
|
     | O
saw O
only O
the O
figure O
of O
the O
stern O
, O
gloomy O
father O

had O
always O
been O
in O
the O
habit O

she O
dropped O
down O
again O
, O
content O

carry O
on O
the O
conversation O

Mary B-PERSON

  | O
Mary B-PERSON
gave O
a O
low O
moan,—and O
then O
implored O
Sally B-PERSON
to O
change O
the O
subject O
  O
for O
unpleasant O
as O
it O

     | O
always O
was O

it O
was O
doubly O
unpleasant O
in O
the O
manner O

treating O

If O
they O

alone O

Mary B-PERSON
would O
have O
borne O
it O
patiently,—or B-PERSON

thought,—but O
now O

when O
their O
conversation O
began O
. O
" O
Come O

     | O
mother O

then O
I O

thee O
home O

Mary B-PERSON

Thou B-PERSON
wert O
all O
in O
a O

when O
first O
I O
came O
up O

with O
thee O

thou'rt O
not O

" O
said O
he O
, O
with O
fond O
exaggeration O
of O
|
     | O
her O
helplessness O
. O
| 
  | O
Yet O
a O
little O
more O
lovers O
' O
loitering O
  O
a O
few O
more O
words O
, O
in O
themselves O
nothing O
— O
to O
you O
nothing O
, O
|
     | O
but O
to O
those O
two B-CARDINAL
what O
tender O
passionate O
language O
can O
I O
use O
to O
express O
the O
feelings O
which O
|
     | O
thrilled O
through O
that O
young O
man O
and O
maiden O
, O
as O
they O
listened O
to O
the O
syllables O
made O
dear O
and O
|
     | O
lovely O
through O
life O
by O
that O
hour B-TIME
's O
low O
- O
whispered O
talk O
. O
| 
  | O
It O
struck O
the B-TIME
half I-TIME
hour I-TIME
past I-TIME
seven I-TIME
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Come O
and O
speak O
to O

her O
daughter O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
darling O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
So O
they O
went O
in O
. O
Jane B-PERSON
Wilson I-PERSON
was O
rather O
chafed O
at O
her O
son O
's O
delay O
in O
returning O
home O
, O
for O
as O
|
     | O
yet O
he O
had O
managed O
to O
keep O
her O
in O
ignorance O
of O
his O
dismissal O
from O
the O
foundry O
  O
and O
it O
was O
her O
|
     | O
way O
to O
prepare O
some O
little O
pleasure O
, O
some O
little O
comfort O
for O
those O
she O
loved O
  O
and O
if O
they O
, O
|
     | O
unwittingly O
, O
did O
not O
appear O
at O
the O
proper O
time O
to O
enjoy O
her O
preparation O
, O
she O
worked O
herself O
up O
|
     | O
into O
a O
state O
of O
fretfulness O
which O
found O
vent O
in O
upbraidings O
as O
soon O
as O
ever O
the O
objects O
of O
her O
|
     | O
care O
appeared O
, O
thereby O
marring O
the O
peace O
which O
should O
ever O
be O
the O
atmosphere O
of O
a O
home O
, O
however O
|
     | O
humble O
  O
and O
causing O
a O
feeling O
almost O
amounting O
to O
loathing O
to O
arise O
at O
the O
sight O
of O
the O
|
     | O
" O
stalled O
ox O
, O
" O
which O
, O
though O
an O
effect O
and O
proof O
of O
careful O
love O
, O
has O
been O
the O
cause O
of O
so O
much O
|
     | O
disturbance O
. O
| 
  | O
Mrs. O
Wilson B-PERSON
had O
first O
sighed O
, O
and O
then O
grumbled O
to O
herself O
, O
over O
the O
increasing O
toughness O
of O
|
     | O
the O
potato O
- O
cakes O
she O
had O
made O
for O
her O
son O
's O
tea O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
door O
opened O
, O
and O
he O
came O
in O
  O
his O
face O
brightening O
into O
proud O
smiles O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
Barton I-PERSON
hanging O
|
     | O
on O
his O
arm O
, O
blushing O
and O
dimpling O
, O
with O
eye O
- O
lids O
veiling O
the O
happy O
light O
of O
her O
eyes,—there O
was O
|
     | O
around O
the O
young O
couple O
a O
radiant O
atmosphere O
— O
a O
glory O
of O
happiness O
. O
| 
  | O
Could O
his O
mother O
mar O
it O
? O
Could O
she O
break O
into O
it O
with O
her O
Martha B-PERSON
- O
like O
cares O
? O
Only O
for O
one B-CARDINAL
|
     | O
moment O
did O
she O
remember O
her O
sense O
of O
injury,—her O
wasted O
trouble,—and O
then O
, O
her O
whole O
woman O
's O
|
     | O
heart O
heaving O
with O
motherly O
love O
and O
sympathy O
, O
she O
opened O
her O
arms O
, O
and O
received O
Mary B-PERSON
into O
|
     | O
them O
, O
as O
, O
shedding O
tears O
of O
agitated O
joy O
, O
she O
murmured O
in O
her O
ear O
, O
| 
  | O
" O

thee O

Mary B-PERSON
, O

and O
God B-PERSON
bless O
thee O

" O
| 
  | O
It O
took O
some O
of O
Jem B-PERSON
's O
self O
- O
command O
to O
separate O
those O
whom O
he O
so O
much O
loved O
, O
and O
who O
were O

     | O
beginning O
, O
for O
his O
sake O
, O
to O
love O
one O
another O
so O
dearly O
. O
But O
the O
time O
for O
his O
meeting O
John B-PERSON
|
     | I-PERSON
Barton I-PERSON
drew O
on O
: O
and O
it O
was O
a O
long O
way O
to O
his O
house O
. O
| 
  | O
As O
they O
walked O
briskly O
thither O
they O
hardly O
spoke O
  O
though O
many O
thoughts O
were O
in O
their O
|
     | O
minds O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
sun O
had O
not O
long O
set O
, O
but O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
faint O
shade O
of O
twilight O
was O
over O
all O
  O
and O
when O
they O
|
     | O
opened O
the O
door O
, O
Jem B-PERSON
could O
hardly O
perceive O
the O
objects O
within O
by O
the O
waning O
light O
of O
day O
, O
and O
|
     | O
the O
flickering O
fire O
- O
blaze O
. O
| 
  | O
But O
Mary B-PERSON
saw O
all O
at O
a O
glance O
! O
| 
  | O
Her O
eye O
, O
accustomed O
to O
what O
was O
usual O
in O
the O
aspect O
of O
the O
room O
, O
saw O
instantly O
what O
was O
|
     | O
unusual,—saw O
, O
and O
understood O
it O
all O
. O
| 
  | O
Her O
father O
was O
standing O
behind O
his O
habitual O
chair O
, O
holding O
by O
the O
back O
of O
it O
as O
if O
for O
|
     | O
support O
. O
And O
opposite O
to O
him O
there O
stood O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON
  O
the O
dark O
out O
- O
line O
of O
his O
stern O
figure O
|
     | O
looming O
large O
against O
the O
light O
of O
the O
fire O
in O
that O
little O
room O
. O
| 
  | O
Behind O
her O
father O
sat O
Job B-PERSON
Legh I-PERSON
, O
his O
head O
in O
his O
hands O
, O
and O
resting O
his O
elbows O
on O
the O
little O
|
     | O
family O
table,—listening O
evidently O
  O
but O
as O
evidently O
deeply O
affected O
by O
what O
he O
heard O
. O
| 
  | O
There O
seemed O
to O
be O
some O
pause O
in O
the O
conversation O
. O
Mary B-PERSON
and O
Jem B-PERSON
stood O
at O
the O
half O
- O
open O
door O
, O
|
     | O
not O
daring O
to O
stir O
  O
hardly O
to O
breathe O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
And O
have O
I O
heard O
you O
aright O
? O
" O
began O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON
, O
with O
his O
deep O
quivering O
voice O
. O
" O
Man O
! O
have O
I O

     | O
heard O
you O
aright O

Was O
it O
you O
, O
then O
, O
that O
killed O
my O
boy O
? O
my O
only O
son?"—(he O
said O
these O
last O
few O
|
     | O
words O
almost O
as O
if O
appealing O
for O
pity O
, O
and O
then O
he O
changed O
his O
tone O
to O
one B-CARDINAL
more O
vehement O
and O
|
     | O
fierce O
) O
. O
" O
Do O
n't O
dare O
to O
think O
that O
I O
shall O
be O
merciful O

spare O
you O

you O
have O
come O

forward O
to O
accuse O
yourself O

I O
tell O
you O

will O
not O
spare O
you O
the O
least O

inflict,—you O

not O
show O

| 
  | O
" O
I O
did O
not O
ask O
for O
any O

said O
John B-PERSON

in O
a O
low O
voice O

said O
he O
, O
advancing O
his O
face O
, O

     | O
and O
repeating O
the O
word O
with O
slow O

grinding O
emphasis O

as O
if O

infuse O
some O
of O
the O
bitterness O

     | O
his O
soul O
into O
it O

John B-PERSON
Barton I-PERSON
gasped O
, O
but O
not O
with O
fear O
. O
It O
was O
only O
that O
he O
felt O
it O
terrible O
to O
have O
inspired O

     | O
such O
hatred O

as O
was O
concentrated O
into O
every O

to O
plead O
some O
faint O

stronger O

the O
approach O

  | O
When O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON
left O
the O
house O
he O
was O
dizzy O
with O
agitation O
  O
the O
hot O
blood O
went O
careering O
|
     | O
through O
his O
frame O
. O
He O
could O
not O
see O
the O
deep O
blue O
of O
the O
night O
- O
heavens O
for O
the O
fierce O
pulses O
|
     | O
which O
throbbed O
in O
his O
head O
. O
And O
partly O
to O
steady O
and O
calm O
himself O
, O
he O
leaned O
against O
a O
railing O
, O
|
     | O
and O
looked O
up O
into O
those O
calm O
majestic O
depths O
with O
all O
their O
thousand B-CARDINAL
stars O
. O
| 
  | O
And O
by O
- O
and O
- O
by O
his O
own O
voice O
returned O
upon O
him O
, O
as O
if O
the O
last O
words O
he O
had O
spoken O
were O
being O
|
     | O
uttered O
through O
all O
that O
infinite O
space O
  O
but O
in O
their O
echoes O
there O
was O
a O
tone O
of O
unutterable O
|
     | O
sorrow O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Let O
my O
trespasses O
be O
unforgiven O
, O
so O
that O
I O
may O
have O
vengeance O
for O
my O
son O
's O
murder O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
He O
tried O
to O
shake O
off O
the O
spiritual O
impression O
made O
by O
this O
imagination O
. O
He O
was O
feverish O
and O
|
     | O
ill,—and O
no O
wonder O
. O
| 
  | O
So O
he O
turned O
to O
go O
homewards O
  O
not O
, O
as O
he O
had O
threatened O
, O
to O
the O
police O
- O
office O
. O
After O
all O
( O
he O
|
     | O
told O
himself O
) O
, O
that O
would O
do O
in O
the O
morning O
. O
No O
fear O
of O
the O
man O
's O
escaping O
, O
unless O
he O
escaped O
|
     | O
to O
the O
grave O
. O
| 
  | O
So O
he O
tried O
to O
banish O
the O
phantom O
voices O
and O
shapes O
which O
came O
unbidden O
to O
his O
brain O
, O
and O
to O
|
     | O
recall O
his O
balance O
of O
mind O
by O
walking O
calmly O
and O
slowly O
, O
and O
noticing O
every O
thing O
which O
struck O
|
     | O
his O
senses O
. O
| 
  | O
It O
was O
a O
warm O
soft O
evening B-TIME
in O
spring B-DATE
, O
and O
there O
were O
many O
persons O
in O
the O
streets O
. O
Among O
|
     | O
others O
, O
a O
nurse O
with O
a O
little O
girl O
in O
her O
charge O
, O
conveying O
her O
home O
from O
some O
children O
's O
|
     | O
gaiety O
  O
a O
dance O
most O
likely O
, O
for O
the O
lovely O
little O
creature O
was O
daintily O
decked O
out O
in O
soft O
, O
|
     | O
snowy O
muslin O
  O
and O
her O
fairy O
feet O
tripped O
along O
by O
her O
nurse O
's O
side O
as O
if O
to O
the O
measure O
of O
some O

     | O
tune O
she O
had O
lately O
kept O
time O
to O
. O
| 
  | O
Suddenly O
up O
behind O
her O
there O
came O
a O
rough O
, O
rude O
errand O
- O
boy O
, O
nine B-DATE
or I-DATE
ten I-DATE
years I-DATE
of I-DATE
age I-DATE
  O
a O
giant O
|
     | O
he O
looked O
by O
the O
fairy O
- O
child O
, O
as O
she O
fluttered O
along O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
it O
was O
, O
but O
in O
some O
|
     | O
awkward O
way O
he O
knocked O
the O
poor O
little O
girl O
down O
upon O
the O
hard O
pavement O
as O
he O
brushed O
rudely O
|
     | O
past O
, O
not O
much O
caring O
whom O
he O
hurt O
, O
so O
that O
he O
got O
along O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
child O
arose O
sobbing O
with O
pain O
  O
and O
not O
without O
cause O
, O
for O
blood O
was O
dropping O
down O
from O
|
     | O
the O
face O
, O
but O
a B-TIME
minute I-TIME
before O
so O
fair O
and O
bright O
— O
dropping O
down O
on O
the O
pretty O
frock O
, O
making O
|
     | O
those O
scarlet O
marks O
so O
terrible O
to O
little O
children O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
nurse O
, O
a O
powerful O
woman O
, O
had O
seized O
the O
boy O
, O
just O
as O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON
( O
who O
had O
seen O
the O
whole O
|
     | O
transaction O
) O
came O
up O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
You O
naughty O
little O
rascal O
! O
I O
'll O
give O
you O
to O
a O
policeman O

that O
I O
will O
! O
Do O
you O
see O
how O
you O
've O

     | O
hurt O
the O
little O
girl O
? O
Do O
you O
? O
" O
accompanying O
every O
sentence O
with O
a O
violent O
jerk O
of O
passionate O
|
     | O
anger O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
lad O
looked O
hard O
and O
defying O
  O
but O
withal O
terrified O
at O
the O
threat O
of O
the O
policeman O
, O
those O
|
     | O
ogres O
of O
our O
streets O
to O
all O
unlucky O
urchins O
. O
The O
nurse O
saw O
it O
, O
and O
began O
to O
drag O
him O
along O
, O
|
     | O
with O
a O
view O
of O
making O
what O
she O
called O
" O
a O
wholesome O
impression O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
His O
terror O
increased O
, O
and O
with O
it O
his O
irritation O
  O
when O
the O
little O
sweet O
face O
, O
choking O
away O
|
     | O
its O
sobs O
, O
pulled O
down O
nurse O
's O
head O
and O
said O
, O
| 
  | O
" O
Please O
, O
dear O
nurse O
, O
I O
'm O
not O

was O
very O
silly O
to O
cry O

He O
did O
not O

He O
did O

policeman O

frightened O

" O
And O
she O
put O
up O
her O
little O
mouth O
to O
be O
kissed O
by O
her O

     | O
injurer O

she O

passer O

half B-CARDINAL
to O
himself O
, O
and O
half B-CARDINAL
to O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON
, O
whom O
he O
had O
observed O

     | O
to O
notice O
the O
scene O

| 
  | O
The O
latter O
took O
no O
apparent O
heed O
of O
the O
remark O
, O
but O
passed O
on O
. O
But O
the O
child O
's O
pleading O
|
     | O
reminded O
him O
of O
the O
low O
, O
broken O
voice O
he O
had O
so O
lately O
heard O
, O
penitently O
and O
humbly O
urging O
the O
|
     | O
same O
extenuation O
of O
his O
great O
guilt O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
did O
not O
know O
what O
I O
was O
doing O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
He O
had O
some O
association O
with O
those O
words O
  O
he O
had O
heard O

read O
of O
that O

He O
would O
look O
when O
he O
got O
home O

So O
when O
he O
entered O
his O
house O
he O
went O
straight O

silently O

     | O
up O

to O

" O
You O
see O
I O
've O
so O
often O
been O
hankering O
after O

it O
's O
a O
hard O
one O
for O
a O

At O

it O

been O

to O

No O

no O

I O
heard O
say O
the O

was O
a O
good O
book O

So O
when O
I O
grew O
thoughtful O

puzzled O

I O
took O
to O
it O
. O
But O
you O
'd O
never O

     | O
believe O

I O
can O

I O

no O

out O
two B-CARDINAL

three B-CARDINAL

as O
clear O
as O

and O
I O

I O

I O
'd O

Then O
again O

After O

Job B-PERSON

had O
gone O
home O

one O
struck O
down O
with O
the O
unexpected O
shock O
. O
Mary B-PERSON
and O
Jem B-PERSON
together O
|
     | O
waited O
the O
approach O
of O
death O
  O
but O
as O
the O
final O
struggle O
drew O
on O
, O
and O
morning B-TIME
dawned O
, O
Jem B-PERSON
|
     | O
suggested O
some O
alleviation O
to O
the O
gasping O
breath O
, O
to O
purchase O
which O
he O
left O
the O
house O
in O
search O
|
     | O
of O
a O
druggist O
's O
shop O
, O
which O
should O
be O
open O
at O
that B-TIME
early I-TIME
hour I-TIME
. O
| 
  | O
During O
his O
absence O
, O
Barton B-PERSON
grew O
worse O
  O
he O
had O
fallen O
across O
the O
bed O
, O
and O
his O
breathing O
seemed O
|
     | O
almost O
stopped O
  O
in O
vain O
did O
Mary B-PERSON
strive O
to O
raise O
him O
, O
her O
sorrow O
and O
exhaustion O
had O
rendered O
|
     | O
her O
too O
weak O
. O
| 
  | O
So O
, O
on O
hearing O
some O
one O
enter O
the O
house O
- O
place O
below O
, O
she O
cried O
out O
for O
Jem B-PERSON
to O
come O
to O
her O

     | O
assistance O
. O
| 
  | O
A O
step O
, O
which O
was O
not O
Jem B-PERSON
's O
, O
came O
up O
the O
stairs O
. O
| 
  | O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON
stood O
in O
the O
door O

way O
. O
In O
one B-CARDINAL
instant O
he O
comprehended O
the O
case O
. O
| 
  | O
He O
raised O
up O
the O
powerless O
frame O
  O
and O
the O
departing O
soul O
looked O
out O
of O
the O
eyes O
with O
|
     | O
gratitude O
. O
He O
held O
the O
dying O
man O
propped O
in O
his O
arms O
. O
John B-PERSON
Barton I-PERSON
folded O
his O
hands O
as O
if O

  | O
" O
Pray O

" O
said O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
sinking O
on O
her O
knees O
, O
and O
forgetting O
in O
that O
solemn O
hour O
all O
that O
|
     | O
had O
divided O
her O
father O
and O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
No O
other O
words O
could O
suggest O
themselves O
than O
some O
of O
those O
he O
had O
read O
only B-TIME
a I-TIME
few I-TIME
hours I-TIME

     | O
before O
. O
| 
  | O
" O

  | O
And O
when O
the O
words O
were O
said O
, O
John B-PERSON

lay O
a O
corpse O
in O
Mr. O

ended O

tragedy O

Mary B-PERSON

nothing O

many O

When O
she O
recovered O
consciousness O

she O
found O
herself O

supported O
by O

on O
the O

were O
there O
, O
talking O

     | O
together O
lowly O
and O
solemnly O
. O
Then O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON
bade O
farewell O
and O
left O
the O

Job B-PERSON
said O

aloud O

thus O
she O

was O
spared O

For O
in O

worn O

     | O
out O

much O

very O
excess O

itself O
to O
sleep O

     | O
before O
we O
have O
had O
time O
to O
realise O
its O
cause O
  O
and O
we O
waken O
, O
with O
a O
start O
of O
agony O
like O
a O
fresh O
|
     | O
stab O
, O
to O
the O
consciousness O
of O
the O
one B-CARDINAL
awful O
vacancy O

which O

never O

The O
day O
brought O
its O
burden O
of O
duty O
to O
Mrs. O
Wilson B-PERSON
. O
She O
felt O
bound O
by O
regard O
, O
as O
well O
as O
by O

     | O
etiquette O
, O
to O
go O
and O
see O
her O
future O
daughter O
- O
in O

. O
And O
by O
an O
old O
association O
of O
ideas O

     | O
( O
perhaps O
of O
death O
with O
church O
- O
yards O
, O
and O
churches O
with O
Sunday B-DATE
) O
she O
thought O
it O
necessary O
to O
put O
|
     | O
on O
her O
best O
, O
and O
latterly O
unused O
clothes O
, O
the O
airing O
of O
which O
on O
a O
little O
clothes O
- O
horse O
before O
|
     | O
the O
fire O
seemed O
to O
give O
her O
a O
not O
unpleasing O
occupation O
. O
| 
  | O
When O
Jem B-PERSON
returned O
home O
late B-TIME
in I-TIME
the I-TIME
evening I-TIME
succeeding O
John B-PERSON
Barton I-PERSON
's O
death O
, O
weary O
and O
|
     | O
oppressed O
with O
the O
occurrences O
and O
excitements O
of O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
he O
found O
his O
mother O
busy O
about O
her O
|
     | O
mourning O
, O
and O
much O
inclined O
to O
talk O
. O
Although O
he O
longed O
for O
quiet O
, O
he O
could O
not O
avoid O
sitting O
|
     | O
down O
and O
answering O
her O
questions O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Well O
, O
Jem B-PERSON
, O
he O
's O
gone O
at O
last O
, O
is O
he O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Yes O
. O
How O
did O
you O
hear O
, O
mother O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Oh O
, O
Job O
came O
over O
here O
and O
telled O
me O
, O
on O
his O
way O
to O
the O
undertaker O
's O
. O
Did O
he O
make O
a O
fine O
|
     | O
end O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
It O
struck O
Jem B-PERSON
that O
she O
had O
not O
heard O
of O
the O
confession O
which O
had O
been O
made O
by O
John B-PERSON
Barton I-PERSON
on O
|
     | O
his O
death O
- O
bed O
  O
he O
remembered O
Job B-PERSON
Legh I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
discretion O
, O
and O
he O
determined O
that O
if O
it O
could O
be O
|
     | O
avoided O
his O
mother O
should O
never O
hear O
of O
it O
. O
Many O
of O
the O
difficulties O
to O
be O
anticipated O
in O
|
     | O
preserving O
the O
secret O
would O
be O
obviated O
, O
if O
he O
could O
induce O
his O
mother O
to O
fall O
into O
the O
plan O
he O
|
     | O
had O
named O
to O
Mary B-PERSON
of O
emigrating O
to O
Canada B-GPE
. O
The O
reasons O
which O
rendered O
this O
secrecy O
desirable O
|
     | O
related O
to O
the O
domestic O
happiness O
he O
hoped O
for O
. O
With O
his O
mother O
's O
irritable O
temper O
he O
could O
|
     | O
hardly O
expect O
that O
all O
allusion O
to O
the O
crime O
of O
John B-PERSON
Barton I-PERSON
would O
be O
for O
ever O
restrained O
from O
|
     | O
passing O
her O
lips O
, O
and O
he O
knew O
the O
deep O
trial O
such O
references O
would O
be O
to O
Mary B-PERSON
. O
Accordingly O
he O
|
     | O
resolved O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
in O
the B-TIME
morning I-TIME
to O
go O
to O
Job B-LOC
and O
beseech O
his O
silence O
  O
he O
trusted O
|
     | O
that O
secrecy O
in O
that B-DATE
quarter I-DATE
, O
even O
if O
the O
knowledge O
had O
been O
extended O
to O
Margaret B-PERSON
, O
might O
be O
|
     | O
easily O
secured O
. O
| 
  | O
But O
what O
would O
be O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON
's O
course O
? O
Were O
there O
any O
means O
by O
which O
he O
might O
be O
persuaded O
to O
|
     | O
spare O
John B-PERSON
Barton I-PERSON
's O
memory O
? O
| 
  | O
He O
was O
roused O
up O
from O
this O
train O
of O
thought O
by O
his O
mother O
's O
more O
irritated O
tone O
of O

" O

Jem B-PERSON
was O
glad O

this O
talking O

the O
solitude O

quiet O
of O
his O

where O

     | O
he O
could O
lie O

remained O

The O
first B-ORDINAL

to O
seek O
an O

early O

next O
morning O
Jem B-PERSON

off O

his O

It O
was O
not O
a O
cheering O

that O

be O
severed O

from O

that O
it O
was O
a O
relief O
to O

that O

he O

together O

wept O

was O
led O
to O
inquire O

weeping O

her O
by O
every O

revealed O

astonished O

generosity O
came O
out O

weak O

its O
irritation O
to O

conduct O
in O
small O
things O
, O

daily O

even O
at O
the O
time O

no O

a O

Mr. O

stood O
at O
one O
of O

The O

was O
suddenly O
hidden O
from O
his O
sight,—vanished O
into O
the O
deep O
|
     | O
mystery O
which O
circumscribes O
existence O
. O
Nay O
, O
even O
the O
vengeance O
which O
he O
had O
proposed O
to O
himself O

     | O
as O
an O
aim O

, O
had O
been O
taken O
away O
from O

his O

as O
by O
the O
hand O

God O

  | O
Events O
like O
these O
would O
have O
startled O
the O
most O
thoughtless O
into O
reflection O
, O
much O
more O
such O
a O
|
     | O
man O
as O
Mr. O
Carson B-PERSON
, O
whose O
mind O
, O
if O
not O
enlarged O
, O
was O
energetic O
  O
indeed O
, O
whose O
very O
energy O
, O
|
     | O
having O
been O
hitherto O
the O
cause O
of O
the O
employment O
of O
his O
powers O
in O
only B-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
direction O
, O
had O
|
     | O
prevented O
him O
from O
becoming O
largely O
and O
philosophically O
comprehensive O
in O
his O
views O
. O
| 
  | O
But O
now O
the O
foundations O
of O
his O
past O
life O
were O
razed O
to O
the O
ground O
, O
and O
the O
place O
they O
had O
|
     | O
once O
occupied O
was O
sown O
with O
salt O
, O
to O
be O
for O
ever O
rebuilt O
no O
more O
. O
It O
was O
like O
the O
change O
from O
|
     | O
this O
Life O
to O
that O
other O
hidden O
one O
, O
when O
so O
many O
of O
the O
motives O
which O
have O
actuated O
all O
our O

     | O
earthly O
existence O
, O
will O
have O
become O
more O
fleeting O
than O
the O
shadows O
of O
a O
dream O
. O
With O
a O
wrench O
of O
|
     | O
his O
soul O
from O
the O
past O
, O
so O
much O
of O
which O
was O
as O
nothing O
, O
and O
worse O
than O
nothing O
to O
him O
now O
, O
Mr. O
|
     | O
Carson B-PERSON
took O
some B-TIME
hours I-TIME
, O
after O
he O
had O
witnessed O
the O
death O
of O
his O
son O
's O
murderer O
, O
to O
consider O
his O
|
     | O
situation O
. O
| 
  | O
But O
suddenly O
, O
while O
he O
was O
deliberating O
, O
and O
searching O
for O
motives O
which O
should O
be O
effective O
|
     | O
to O
compel O
him O
to O
exertion O
and O
action O
once O
more O
  O
while O
he O
contemplated O
the O
desire O
after O
riches O
, O
|
     | O
social O
distinction O
, O
a O
name O
among O
the O
merchant O
- O
princes O
amidst O
whom O
he O
moved O
, O
and O
saw O
these O
false O
|
     | O
substances O
fade O
away O
into O
the O
shadows O
they O
truly O
are O
, O
and O
one B-CARDINAL
by O
one B-CARDINAL
disappear O
into O
the O
grave O
|
     | O
of O
his O
son,—suddenly O
, O
I O
say O
, O
the O
thought O
arose O
within O
him O
that O
more O
yet O
remained O
to O
be O
learned O
|
     | O
about O
the O
circumstances O
and O
feelings O
which O
had O
prompted O
John B-PERSON
Barton I-PERSON
's O
crime O
  O
and O
when O
once O
this O
|
     | O
mournful O
curiosity O
was O
excited O
, O
it O
seemed O
to O
gather O
strength O
in O
every O
moment O
that O
its O
|
     | O
gratification O
was O
delayed O
. O
Accordingly O
he O
sent O
a O
message O
to O
summon O
Job B-PERSON
Legh I-PERSON
and O
Jem B-PERSON
Wilson I-PERSON
, O
|
     | O
from O
whom O
he O
promised O
himself O
some O
elucidation O
of O
what O
was O
as O
yet O
unexplained O
  O
while O
he O
himself O
|
     | O
set O
forth O
to O
call O
on O
Mr. O
Bridgenorth B-PERSON
, O
whom O
he O
knew O
to O
have O
been O
Jem B-PERSON
's O
attorney O
, O
with O
a O
|
     | O
glimmering O
suspicion O
intruding O
on O
his O
mind O
, O
which O
he O
strove O
to O
repel O
, O
that O
Jem B-PERSON
might O
have O
had O
|
     | O
some O
share O
in O
his O
son O
's O
death O
. O
| 
  | O
He O
had O
returned O
before O
his O
summoned O
visitors O
arrived O
  O
and O
had O
time O
enough O
to O
recur O
to O
the O
|
     | O
evening O
on O
which O
John B-PERSON
Barton I-PERSON
had O
made O
his O
confession O
. O
He O
remembered O
with O
mortification O
how O
he O
|
     | O
had O
forgotten O
his O
proud O
reserve O
, O
and O
his O
habitual O
concealment O
of O
his O
feelings O
, O
and O
had O
laid O
|
     | O
bare O
his O
agony O
of O
grief O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
these O
two B-CARDINAL
men O
who O
were O
coming O
to O
see O
him O
by O
his O
|
     | O
desire O
  O
and O
he O
entrenched O
himself O
behind O
stiff O
barriers O
of O
self O
- O
control O
, O
through O
which O
he O
hoped O
|
     | O
no O
appearance O
of O
emotion O
would O
force O
its O
way O
in O
the O
conversation O
he O
anticipated O
. O
| 
  | O
Nevertheless O
, O
when O
the O
servant O
announced O
that O
two B-CARDINAL
men O
were O
there O
by O
appointment O
to O
speak O
to O
|
     | O
him O
, O
and O
he O
had O
desired O
that O
they O
might O
be O
shown O
into O
the O
library O
where O
he O
sat O
, O
any O
watcher O
|
     | O
might O
have O
perceived O
by O
the O
trembling O
hands O
, O
and O
shaking O
head O
, O
not O
only O
how O
much O
he O
was O
aged O
by O
|
     | O
the O
occurrences O
of O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
few I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
, O
but O
also O
how O
much O
he O
was O
agitated O
at O
the O
thought O
of O
the O
|
     | O
impending O
interview O
. O
| 
  | O
But O
he O
so O
far O
succeeded O
in O
commanding O
himself O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
as O
to O
appear O
to O
Jem B-PERSON
Wilson I-PERSON
and O
Job B-PERSON
|
     | I-PERSON
Legh I-PERSON
one O
of O
the O
hardest O
and O
most O
haughty O
men O
they O
had O
ever O
spoken O
to O
, O
and O
to O
forfeit O
all O
the O
|
     | O
interest O
which O
he O
had O
previously O
excited O
in O
their O
minds O
by O
his O
unreserved O
display O
of O
deep O
and O
|
     | O
genuine O
feeling O
. O
| 
  | O
When O
he O
had O
desired O
them O
to O
be O
seated O
, O
he O
shaded O
his O
face O
with O
his O
hand O
for O
an O
instant O
before O

     | O
speaking O

a B-TIME

out O

up O

something O

the O

sank O
back O
in O
his O
chair O

weak O

powerless O

He O
rose O
up O
again O

Jem B-PERSON

on O

anxious O

Jem B-PERSON

very O
red O
at O
the O
allusion O

made O
to O
Mary B-PERSON

his O
honest O

fearless O
eyes O

     | O
met O
Mr. O

penetrating O
gaze O
unflinchingly O
, O

had O
carried O
conviction O
of O
his O
innocence O

truthfulness O

Mr. O

felt O

both O

rose O

bowed O
low O

looking O
at O
Mr. O

with O
the O
deep O
human O

bowed O
low O

he O
suddenly O

forward O

shook O

thus O
, O
without O

parted O

are O
stages O

lifted O
out O

the O

" O
You O
never O

not O

that O

she O
wanted O
a O
spot O

in O
, O
in O

     | O
peace O

It O

a O
queer O
sort O

They O
made O
some O

found O
that O
in O
the O
restlessness O
of O
approaching O
death O

she O
had O

     | O
longed O

gone O
forth,—where O

told O
her O
of O
his O

success O
  O

both O
were O
saddened O
at O
the O
recital O

and O
sat O
silent O
for O
some O

     | O
time O

After O
a O
while O
they O

talking O
over O

In O

which O

     | O
would O
take O
place O
immediately O
before O
sailing O
  O
they O
talked O
themselves O
back O
into O
silence O
and O
|
     | O
delicious O
reverie O
. O
Mary B-PERSON
sat O
by O
Jem B-PERSON
, O
his O
arm O
round O
her O
waist O
, O
her O
head O
on O
his O
shoulder O
  O
and O

     | O
thought O
over O
the O
scenes O
which O
had O
passed O
in O
that O
home O
she O
was O
so O
soon O
to O
leave O

| 
  | O
Suddenly O
she O
felt O
Jem B-PERSON
start O
, O
and O
started O
too O
without O
knowing O
why O
  O
she O
tried O
to O
see O
his O
|
     | O
countenance O
, O
but O
the O
shades O
of O
evening B-TIME
had O
deepened O
so O
much O
she O
could O
read O
no O
expression O
there O
. O

     | O
It O
was O
turned O
to O
the O
window O

she O
looked O
and O
saw O
a O
white O
face O
pressed O
against O
the O
panes O
on O
the O

     | O
outside O
, O
gazing O
intently O
into O
the O
dusky O
chamber O
. O

  | O
While O
they O
watched O
, O
as O
if O
fascinated O
by O
the O
appearance O
, O
and O
unable O
to O
think O
or O
stir O
, O
a O
film O

     | O
came O
over O
the O
bright O
, O
feverish O
, O
glittering O
eyes O
outside O
, O
and O
the O
form O
sank O
down O
to O
the O
ground O

     | O
without O
a O
struggle O
of O
instinctive O
resistance O
. O

" O
It O

Esther B-PERSON

" O
exclaimed O
they O
, O
both O
at O
once O
. O
They O
rushed O
outside O
  O
and O
, O
fallen O
into O
what O

     | O
appeared O
simply O
a O
heap O
of O
white O

light O

coloured O

fainting O

again O
before O
her O
death O

Whether O

indeed O
alive O

beat O
a O
little O
yet O
. O

     | O
They O
carried O
her O
upstairs O
and O
laid O
her O
on O
Mary B-PERSON

bed O
, O
not O
daring O
to O
undress O
her O
, O
lest O
any O

frighten O
the O

away O

it O
was O
all O
in O

  | O
Towards O
midnight B-TIME
, O
she O
opened O
wide O
her O

looked O
around O
on O
the O
once O

knelt O
by O
the O

praying O
aloud O

fervently O
for O
her O
, O
but O
he O
stopped O
as O
he O
saw O
her O
roused O

     | O
look O
. O
She O
sat O
up O
in O
bed O
with O
a O
sudden O
convulsive O
motion O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Has O
it O
been O
a O
dream O
then O
? O
" O
asked O
she O
wildly O
. O
Then O
with O
a O
habit O
, O
which O
came O
like O
instinct O
|
     | O
even O
in O
that O
awful O
dying O
hour O
, O
her O
hand O
sought O
for O
a O
locket O
which O
hung O
concealed O
in O
her O
bosom O
, O

     | O

finding O

befallen O
her O
since O

an O

on O
that O

She O
fell O
back O

spoke O
word O
never O
more O

She O
held O
the O
locket O
containing O
her O

     | O
still O
in O
her O

once O

twice O
she O
kissed O
it O
with O
a O
long O
soft O
kiss O

She O
cried O
feebly O
and O

     | O
sadly O
as O
long O
as O
she O
had O
any O
strength O
to O
cry O
, O

then O
she O
died O
