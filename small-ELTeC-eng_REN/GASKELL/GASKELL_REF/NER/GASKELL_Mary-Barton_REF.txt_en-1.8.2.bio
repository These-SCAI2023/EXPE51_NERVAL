PREFACE O

Three B-DATE
years I-DATE

I O
became O
anxious O
( O
from O
circumstances O
that O
need O
not O
be O
more O
fully O
alluded O
to O
) O
to O
employ O
myself O
in O
writing O
a O
work O
of O
fiction O
. O
Living O
in O
Manchester S-GPE
, O
but O
with O
a O
deep O
relish O
and O
fond O
admiration O
for O
the O
country O
, O
my O
first S-ORDINAL
thought O
was O
to O
find O
a O
frame O
- O
work O
for O
my O
story O
in O
some O
rural O
scene O
| | O
and O
I O
had O
already O
made O
a O
little O
progress O
in O
a O
tale O
, O
the O
period O
of O
which O
was O
more B-DATE
than I-DATE
a I-DATE
century I-DATE
ago E-DATE
, O
and O
the O
place O
on O
the O
borders O
of O
Yorkshire S-GPE
, O
when O
I O
bethought O
me O
how O
deep O
might O
be O
the O
romance O
in O
the O
lives O
of O
some O
of O
those O
who O
elbowed O
me O
daily O
in O
the O
busy O
streets O
of O
the O
town O
in O
which O
I O
resided O
. O
I O
had O
always O
felt O
a O
deep O
sympathy O
with O
the O
care O
- O
worn O
men O
, O
who O
looked O
as O
if O
doomed O
to O
struggle O
through O
their O
lives O
in O
strange O
alternations O
between O
work O
and O
want O
| | O
tossed O
to O
and O
fro O
by O
circumstances O
, O
apparently O
in O
even O
a O
greater O
degree O
than O
other O
men O
. O
A O
little O
manifestation O
of O
this O
sympathy O
, O
and O
a O
little O
attention O
to O
the O
expression O
of O
feelings O
on O
the O
part O
of O
some O
of O
the O
work O
- O
people O
with O
whom O
I O
was O
acquainted O
, O
had O
laid O
open O
to O
me O
the O
hearts O
of O
one S-CARDINAL
or O
two S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
more O
thoughtful O
among O
them O
| | O
I O
saw O
that O
they O
were O
sore O
and O
irritable O
against O
the O
rich O
, O
the O
even O
tenor O
of O
whose O
seemingly O
happy O
lives O
appeared O
to O
increase O
the O
anguish O
caused O
by O
the O
lottery O
- O
like O
nature O
of O
their O
own O
. O
Whether O
the O
bitter O
complaints O
made O
by O
them O
, O
of O
the O
neglect O
which O
they O
experienced O
from O
the O
prosperous O
— O
especially O
from O
the O
masters O
whose O
fortunes O
they O
had O
helped O
to O
build O
up O
— O
were O
well O
- O
founded O
or O
no O
, O
it O
is O
not O
for O
me O
to O
judge O
. O
It O
is O
enough O
to O
say O
, O
that O
this O
belief O
of O
the O
injustice O
and O
unkindness O
which O
they O
endure O
from O
their O
fellow O
- O
creatures O
, O
taints O
what O
might O
be O
resignation O
to O
God's S-PERSON
will O
, O
and O
turns O
it O
to O
revenge O
in O
too O
many O
of O
the O
poor O
uneducated O
factory O
- O
workers O
of O
Manchester S-GPE
. O
The O
more O
I O
reflected O
on O
this O
unhappy O
state O
of O
things O
between O
those O
so O
bound O
to O
each O
other O
by O
common O
interests O
, O
as O
the O
employers O
and O
the O
employed O
must O
ever O
be O
, O
the O
more O
anxious O
I O
became O
to O
give O
some O
utterance O
to O
the O
agony O
which O
, O
from O
time O
to O
time O
, O
convulses O
this O
dumb O
people O
| | O
the O
agony O
of O
suffering O
without O
the O
sympathy O
of O
the O
happy O
, O
or O
of O
erroneously O
believing O
that O
such O
is O
the O
case O
. O
If O
it O
be O
an O
error O
, O
that O
the O
woes O
, O
which O
come O
with O
ever O
- O
returning O
tide O
- O
like O
flood O
to O
overwhelm O
the O
workmen O
in O
our O
manufacturing O
towns O
, O
pass O
unregarded O
by O
all O
but O
the O
sufferers O
, O
it O
is O
at O
any O
rate O
an O
error O
so O
bitter O
in O
its O
consequences O
to O
all O
parties O
, O
that O
whatever O
public O
effort O
can O
do O
in O
the O
way O
of O
legislation O

or O
private O
effort O
in O
the O
way O

helpless O
love O
in O
the O
way O
of O
" O

should O
be O
done O

that O
speedily O

disabuse O

work O

people O
of O
so O
miserable O
a O
misapprehension O

At O
present O
they O
seem O
to O
me O
to O
be O
left O
in O
a O
state O
, O
wherein O
lamentations O
and O
tears O
are O
thrown O
aside O
as O
useless O
, O
but O
in O
which O
the O
lips O
are O
compressed O
for O
curses O
, O
and O
the O
hands O
clenched O
and O
ready O
to O
smite O

know O
nothing O

Economy O

theories O

accounts O
agree O

clash O
with O
any O

the O
agreement O
or O
disagreement O
is O
unintentional O

idea O

I O

as O

In O

there O
is O
a O

feels O
the O

may O
come O
to O
listen O
awhile O
to O
the O
delicious O
sounds O
of O

properly O
describe O

the O

The O
only O
place O
where O
its O

a O
medley O
of O
old O

herbs O

flowers O
, O
planted O
long O

when O

girls O
, O
and O
wore O
the O
usual O
out O
- O
of O

doors O
dress O
of O
that O
particular O
class O
of O
maidens O

namely O
, O
a O
shawl O
, O
which O
at O
mid-day O
or O
in O
fine O
weather O
was O
allowed O
to O
be O
merely O
a O
shawl O
, O
but O
towards O
evening O
, O
or O
if O
the O
day O
were O
chilly O
, O
became O
a O
sort O
of O
Spanish S-NORP
mantilla O
or O
Scotch S-NORP
plaid O
, O
and O
was O
brought O
over O
the O
head O
and O
hung O
loosely O
down O
, O
or O
was O
pinned O
under O
the O
chin O
in O
no O
unpicturesque O
fashion O
. O
Their O
faces O
were O
not O
remarkable O
for O
beauty O
| | O
indeed O
, O
they O
were O
below O
the O
average O
, O
with O
one S-CARDINAL
or O
two S-CARDINAL
exceptions O
| | O
they O
had O
dark O
hair O
, O
neatly O
and O
classically O
arranged O
, O
dark O
eyes O
, O
but O
sallow O
complexions O
and O
irregular O
features O
. O
The O
only O
thing O
to O
strike O
a O
passer O
- O
by O
was O
an O
acuteness O
and O
intelligence O
of O
countenance O
, O
which O
has O
often O
been O
noticed O
in O
a O
manufacturing O
population O
. O
There O
were O
also O
numbers O
of O
boys O
, O
or O
rather O
young O
men O
, O
rambling O
among O
these O
fields O
, O
ready O
to O
bandy O
jokes O
with O
any O
one O
, O
and O
particularly O
ready O
to O
enter O
into O
conversation O
with O
the O
girls O
, O
who O
, O
however O
, O
held O
themselves O
aloof O
, O
not O
in O
a O
shy O
, O
but O
rather O
in O
an O
independent O
way O
, O
assuming O
an O
indifferent O
manner O
to O
the O
noisy O
wit O
or O
obstreperous O
compliments O
of O
the O
lads O
. O
Here O
and O
there O
came O
a O
sober O
quiet O
couple O
, O
either O
whispering O
lovers O
, O
or O
husband O
and O
wife O
, O
as O
the O
case O
might O
be O
| | O
and O
if O
the O
latter O
, O
they O
were O
seldom O
unencumbered O
by O
an O
infant O
, O
carried O
for O
the O
most O
part O
by O
the O
father O
, O
while O
occasionally O
even O
three S-CARDINAL
or O
four S-CARDINAL
little O
toddlers O
had O
been O
carried O
or O
dragged O
thus O
far O
, O
in O
order O
that O
the O
whole O
family O
might O
enjoy O
the O
delicious O
May B-TIME
afternoon E-TIME
together O
. O
Sometime O
in O
the O
course O
of O
that B-TIME
afternoon E-TIME
, O
two S-CARDINAL
working O
men O
met O
with O
friendly O
greeting O
at O
the O
stile O
so O
often O
named O
. O
One S-CARDINAL
was O
a O
thorough O
specimen O
of O
a O
Manchester S-GPE
man O
| | O
born O
of O
factory O
workers O
, O
and O
himself O
bred O
up O
in O
youth O
, O
and O
living O
in O
manhood O
, O
among O
the O
mills O
. O
He O
was O
below O
the O
middle O
size O
and O
slightly O
made O
| | O
there O
was O
almost O
a O
stunted O
look O
about O
him O
| | O
and O
his O
wan O
, O
colourless O
face O
gave O
you O
the O
idea O
, O
that O
in O
his O
childhood O
he O
had O
suffered O
from O
the O
scanty O
living O
consequent O
upon O
bad O
times O
and O
improvident O
habits O
. O
His O
features O
were O
strongly O
marked O
, O
though O
not O
irregular O
, O
and O
their O
expression O
was O
extreme O
earnestness O
| | O
resolute O
either O
for O
good O
or O
evil O
| | O
a O
sort O
of O
latent O
, O
stern O
enthusiasm O
. O
At O
the O
time O
of O
which O
I O
write O
, O
the O
good O
predominated O
over O
the O
bad O
in O
the O
countenance O
, O
and O
he O
was O
one O
from O
whom O
a O
stranger O
would O
have O
asked O
a O
favour O
with O
tolerable O
faith O
that O
it O
would O
be O
granted O
. O
He O
was O
accompanied O
by O
his O
wife O
, O
who O
might O
, O
without O
exaggeration O
, O
have O
been O
called O
a O
lovely O
woman O
, O
although O
now O
her O
face O
was O
swollen O
with O
crying O
, O
and O
often O
hidden O
behind O
her O
apron O
. O
She O
had O
the O
fresh O
beauty O
of O
the O
agricultural O
districts O
| | O
and O
somewhat O
of O
the O
deficiency O
of O
sense O
in O
her O
countenance O
, O
which O
is O
likewise O
characteristic O
of O
the O
rural O
inhabitants O
in O
comparison O
with O
the O
natives O
of O
the O
manufacturing O
towns O
. O
She O
was O
far O
advanced O
in O
pregnancy O
, O
which O
perhaps O
occasioned O
the O
overpowering O
and O
hysterical O
nature O
of O
her O
grief O
. O
The O
friend O
whom O
they O
met O
was O
more O
handsome O
and O
less O
sensible O
- O
looking O
than O
the O
man O
I O
have O
just O
described O
| | O
he O
seemed O
hearty O
and O
hopeful O
, O
and O
although O
his O
age O
was O
greater O
, O
yet O
there O
was O
far O
more O
of O
youth's O
buoyancy O
in O
his O
appearance O
. O
He O
was O
tenderly O
carrying O
a O
baby O
in O
arms O
, O
while O
his O
wife O
, O
a O
delicate O
, O
fragile O
- O
looking O
woman O
, O
limping O
in O
her O
gait O
, O
bore O
another O
of O
the O
same O
age O

little O
, O
feeble O
twins O
, O
inheriting O
the O
frail O
appearance O
of O
their O
mother O
. O
The O
last O
- O
mentioned O
man O
was O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
to O
speak O
, O
while O
a O
sudden O
look O
of O
sympathy O
dimmed O
his O
gladsome O
face O
. O
" O
Well O

in O

he O
added O

" O

Meanwhile O
the O
wives O
greeted O
each O
other O
like O
old O

, O
the O
soft O
and O
plaintive O
voice O
of O
the O

pretty O
looks O
, O
and O
her O
cheery O
ways O
. O
But O
she O
said O
( O
and O
at O
the O
time O
I O
thought O
there O
was O
sense O
in O
what O
she O
said O
) O
we O
should O
be O
much O
better O
friends O
if O
she O
went O
into O
lodgings O
, O
and O
only O
came O
to O
see O
us O
now O
and O
then O
. O
" O
" O
Then O
you O
still O
were O
friendly O
. O
Folks O
said O
you'd O
cast O
her O
off O
, O
and O
said O
you'd O
never O
speak O
to O
her O
again O
. O
" O
" O
Folks O
always O
make O
one O
a O
deal O
worse O
than O
one O
is O
, O
" O
said O
John B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
, O
testily O
. O
" O
She O
came O
many O
a O
time O
to O
our O
house O
after O
she O
left O
off O
living O
with O
us O

Last B-DATE

se'nnight O
— O
no O
! O
it O
was O
this O
very O
last B-DATE
Sunday E-DATE
, O
she O
came O
to O
drink O
a O
cup O
of O
tea O
with O
Mary S-PERSON
| | O
and O
that O
was O
the O
last O
time O
we O
set O
eyes O
on O
her O
. O
" O
" O
Was O
she O
any O
ways O
different O
in O
her O
manner O
? O
" O
asked O
Wilson S-PERSON
. O
" O
Well O
, O
I O
don't O
know O
. O
I O
have O
thought O
several O
times O
since O
, O
that O
she O
was O
a O
bit O
quieter O
, O
and O
more O
womanly O
- O
like O
| | O
more O
gentle O
, O
and O
more O
blushing O
, O
and O
not O
so O
riotous O
and O
noisy O
. O
She O
comes O
in O
, O
toward O
four B-TIME
o'clock E-TIME
, O
when O
afternoon O
church O
was O
loosing O
, O
and O
she O
goes O
and O
hangs O
her O
bonnet O
up O
on O
the O
old O
nail O
we O
used O
to O
call O
hers O
, O
while O
she O
lived O
with O
us O
. O
I O
remember O
thinking O
what O
a O
pretty O
lass O
she O
was O
, O
as O
she O
sat O
on O
a O
low O
stool O
by O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
rocking O
herself O
, O
and O
in O
rather O
a O
poor O
way O
. O
She O
laughed O
and O
cried O
by O
turns O
, O
but O
all O
so O
softly O
and O
gently O
, O
like O
a O
child O
, O
that O
I O
couldn't O
find O
in O
my O
heart O
to O
scold O
her O
, O
especially O
as O
Mary S-PERSON
was O
fretting O
already O
. O
One S-CARDINAL
thing O
I O
do O
remember O
I O
did O
say O
, O
and O
pretty O
sharply O
too O
. O
She O
took O
our O
little O
Mary S-PERSON
by O
the O
waist O
, O
and O
— O
" O
" O
Thou O
must O
leave O
off O
calling O
her O
' O
little O
' O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
she's O
growing O
up O
into O
as O
fine O
a O
lass O
as O
one O
can O
see O
on O
a O
summer's O
day O
| | O
more O
of O
her O
mother's O
stock O
than O
thine O
, O
" O
interrupted O
Wilson S-PERSON
. O
" O
Well O
, O
well O
, O
I O
call O
her O
' O
little O
, O
' O
because O
her O
mother's O
name O
is O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
But O
, O
as O
I O
was O
saying O
, O
she O
takes O
Mary S-PERSON
in O
a O
coaxing O
sort O
of O
way O
, O
and O
, O
' O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
' O
says O
she O
, O
' O
what O
should O
you O
think O
if O
I O
sent O
for O
you O
some O
day O
and O
made O
a O
lady O
of O
you O
? O
' O
So O
I O
could O
not O
stand O
such O
talk O
as O
that O
to O
my O
girl O
, O
and O
I O
said O
, O
' O
Thou'd O
best O
not O
put O
that O
nonsense O
i' O
the O
girl's O
head O
I O
can O
tell O
thee O
| | O
I'd O
rather O
see O
her O
earning O
her O
bread O
by O
the O
sweat O
of O
her O
brow O
, O
as O
the O
Bible S-WORK_OF_ART
tells O
her O
she O
should O
do O
, O
ay O
, O
though O
she O
never O
got O
butter O
to O
her O
bread O
, O
than O
be O
like O
a O
do-nothing O
lady O
, O
worrying O
shopmen O
all O
morning O
, O
and O
screeching O
at O
her O
pianny O
all O
afternoon O
, O
and O
going O
to O
bed O
without O
having O
done O
a O
good O
turn O
to O
any O
one O
of O
God's O
creatures O
but O
herself O
. O
' O
" O
" O
Thou O
never O
could O
abide O
the O
gentlefolk O
, O
" O
said O
Wilson S-PERSON
, O
half O
amused O
at O
his O
friend's O
vehemence O
. O
" O
And O
what O
good O
have O
they O
ever O
done O
me O
that O
I O
should O
like O
them O
? O
" O
asked O
Barton S-PERSON
, O
the O
latent O
fire O
lighting O
up O
his O
eye O
: O
and O
bursting O
forth O
, O
he O
continued O
, O
" O
If O
I O
am O
sick O
, O
do O
they O
come O

nurse O
me O

If O
my O
child O
lies O
dying O
( O
as O
poor O
Tom S-PERSON
lay O
, O
with O
his O
white O
wan O
lips O
quivering O
, O
for O
want O
of O
better O
food O
than O
I O
could O
give O
him O
) O
, O
does O
the O
rich O
man O
bring O
the O
wine O
or O
broth O
that O
might O
save O
his O
life O
? O
If O
I O
am O
out O
of O
work O
for O
weeks S-DATE
in O
the O
bad O
times O
, O
and O
winter O
comes O
, O
with O
black O
frost O
, O
and O
keen O
east O
wind O

and O
there O
is O
no O
coal O
for O
the O
grate O

no O
clothes O

and O
the O
thin O
bones O
are O
seen O
through O
the O
ragged O
clothes O

does O
the O
rich O
man O
share O
his O
plenty O
with O
me O
, O
as O
he O
ought O
to O
do O
, O
if O
his O
religion O
wasn't O
a O
humbug O
? O
When O
I O
lie O
on O
my O
death O
- O
bed O
, O
and O
Mary S-PERSON
( O
bless O
her O
) O
stands O
fretting O
, O
as O
I O
know O
she O
will O
fret O
, O
" O
and O
here O
his O
voice O
faltered O
a O
little O
, O
" O
will O
a O
rich O
lady O
come O

her O

see O
what O
best O
to O
do O
? O
No O
, O
I O
tell O
you O
, O
it's O
the O
poor O
, O
and O
the O
poor O
only O
, O
as O
does O
such O
things O
for O
the O
poor O
. O
Don't O
think O
to O
come O
over O
me O
with O
th' O
old O
tale O
, O
that O
the O
rich O
know O
nothing O
of O
the O
trials O
of O
the O
poor O
. O
I O
say O
, O
if O
they O
don't O
know O
, O
they O
ought O
to O
know O
. O
We're O
their O
slaves O
as O
long O
as O
we O
can O
work O

we O
pile O
up O
their O
fortunes O
with O
the O
sweat O
of O
our O
brows O

and O
yet O
we O
are O
to O
live O
as O
separate O
as O
if O
we O
were O
in O
two S-CARDINAL
worlds O
| | O
ay O
, O
as O
separate O
as O
Dives S-WORK_OF_ART
and O
Lazarus S-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
great O
gulf O
betwixt O
us O
: O
but O
I O
know O
who O
was O
best O
off O
then O
, O
" O
and O
he O
wound O
up O
his O
speech O
with O
a O
low O
chuckle O
that O
had O
no O
mirth O
in O
it O
. O
" O
Well O
, O
neighbour O
, O
" O
said O
Wilson S-PERSON
, O
" O
all O
that O
may O
be O
very O
true O
, O
but O
what O
I O
want O
to O
know O
now O
is O
about O
Esther S-PERSON
— O
when O
did O
you O
last O
hear O
of O
her O
? O
" O
" O
Why O
, O
she O
took O
leave O
of O
us O
that O
Sunday O
night O
in O
a O
very O
loving O
way O
, O
kissing O
both O
wife O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
and O
daughter O
Mary S-PERSON
( O
if O
I O
must O
not O
call O
her O
little O
) O
, O
and O
shaking O
hands O
with O
me O
| | O
but O
all O
in O
a O
cheerful O
sort O
of O
manner O
, O
so O
we O
thought O
nothing O
about O
her O
kisses O
and O
shakes O
. O
But O
on O
Wednesday B-TIME
night E-TIME
comes O
Mrs. O
Bradshaw's S-PERSON
son O
with O
Esther's S-PERSON
box O
, O
and O
presently O
Mrs. O
Bradshaw S-PERSON
follows O
with O
the O
key O
| | O
and O
when O
we O
began O
to O
talk O
, O
we O
found O
Esther S-PERSON
told O
her O
she O
was O
coming O
back O
to O
live O
with O
us O
, O
and O
would O
pay O
her O
week's O
money O
for O
not O
giving O
notice O
| | O
and O
on O
Tuesday B-TIME
night E-TIME
she O
carried O
off O
a O
little O
bundle O
( O
her O
best O
clothes O
were O
on O
her O
back O
, O
as O
I O
said O
before O
) O
, O
and O
told O
Mrs. O
Bradshaw S-PERSON
not O
to O
hurry O
herself O
about O
the O
big O
box O
, O
but O
bring O
it O
when O
she O
had O
time O
. O
So O
of O
course O
she O
thought O
she O
should O
find O
Esther S-PERSON
with O
us O
| | O
and O
when O
she O
told O
her O
story O
, O
my O
missis O
set O
up O
such O
a O
screech O
, O
and O
fell O
down O
in O
a O
dead O
swoon O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
ran O
up O
with O
water O
for O
her O
mother O
, O
and O
I O
thought O
so O
much O
about O
my O
wife O
, O
I O
did O
not O
seem O
to O
care O
at O
all O
for O
Esther S-PERSON
. O
But O
the O
next O
day O
I O
asked O
all O
the O
neighbours O
( O
both O
our O
own O
and O
Bradshaw's S-PERSON
) O
, O
and O
they'd O
none O
of O
' O
em O
heard O
or O
seen O
nothing O
of O
her O
. O
I O
even O
went O
to O
a O
policeman O
, O
a O
good O
enough O
sort O
of O
man O
, O
but O
a O
fellow O
I'd S-PERSON
never O
spoke O
to O
before O
because O
of O
his O
livery O
, O
and O
I O
asks O
him O
if O
his O
' O
cuteness O
could O
find O
any O
thing O
out O
for O
us O
. O
So O
I O
believe O
he O
asks O
other O
policemen O
| | O
and O
one S-CARDINAL
on O
'em O
had O
seen O
a O
wench O
, O
like O
our O
Esther S-PERSON
, O
walking O
very O
quickly O
, O
with O
a O
bundle O
under O
her O
arm O
, O
on O
Tuesday B-TIME
night E-TIME
, O
toward O
eight B-TIME
o'clock E-TIME
, O
and O
get O
into O
a O
hackney O
coach O
, O
near O
Hulme B-FAC
Church E-FAC
, O
and O
we O
don't O
know O
th' O
number O
, O
and O
can't O
trace O
it O
no O
further O
. O
I'm O
sorry O
enough O
for O
the O
girl O
, O
for O
bad's O
come O
over O
her O
, O
one S-CARDINAL
way O
or O
another O
, O
but O
I'm O
sorrier O
for O
my O
wife O
. O
She O
loved O
her O
next O
to O
me O
and O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
and O
she's O
never O
been O
the O
same O
body O
since O
poor O
Tom's S-PERSON
death O
. O
However O
, O
let's O
go O
back O
to O
them O
| | O
your O
old O
woman O
may O
have O
done O
her O
good O
. O
" O
As O
they O
walked O
homewards O
with O
a O
brisker O
pace O
, O
Wilson S-PERSON
expressed O
a O
wish O
that O
they O
still O
were O
the O
near O
neighbours O
they O
once O
had O
been O

" O
Still O
our O

in O
the O
cellar O
under O
No. O
14 S-CARDINAL

in O
Barber B-FAC
Street E-FAC

and O
if O
you'd O
only O
speak O
the O
word O

be O

five B-TIME

keep O

Though O

perhaps O
ought O
not O

See O
, O
there's O
Mary S-PERSON
! O
" O
and O
the O
father's O
eye O
brightened O
, O
as O
in O
the O
distance O
, O
among O
a O
group O
of O
girls O
, O
he O
spied O
his O
only O
daughter O
, O
a O
bonny O
lassie O
of O
thirteen S-CARDINAL
or O
so O
, O
who O
came O
bounding O
along O
to O
meet O
and O
to O
greet O
her O
father O
, O
in O
a O
manner O
which O
showed O
that O
the O
stern O
- O
looking O
man O
had O
a O
tender O
nature O
within O
. O
The O
two S-CARDINAL
men O
had O
crossed O
the O
last O
stile O
while O
Mary S-PERSON
loitered O
behind O
to O
gather O
some O
buds O
of O
the O
coming O
hawthorn O
, O
when O
an O
over O
- O
grown O
lad O
came O
past O
her O
, O
and O
snatched O
a O
kiss O
, O
exclaiming O
, O
" O
For O
old O
acquaintance O
sake O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
" O
" O
Take O
that O
for O
old O
acquaintance O
sake O
, O
then O
, O
" O
said O
the O
girl O
, O
blushing O
rosy O
red O
, O
more O
with O
anger O
than O
shame O
, O
as O
she O
slapped O
his O
face O
. O
The O
tones O
of O
her O
voice O
called O
back O
her O
father O
and O
his O
friend O
, O
and O
the O
aggressor O
proved O
to O
be O
the O
eldest O

" O
Mary S-PERSON
sprang O
forward O
to O
take O
her O
father's O
charge O
, O
with O
a O
girl's O
fondness O
for O
infants O
, O
and O
with O
some O
little O
foresight O
of O
the O
event O
soon O
to O
happen O
at O
home O

while O
young O
Wilson S-PERSON
seemed O
to O
lose O
his O
rough O
, O
cubbish O
nature O
as O
he O
crowed O
and O
cooed O
to O
his O

Polly S-PERSON

put O
the O
kettle O
on O
, O
And O
let's O
have O
tea O
! O
Polly S-PERSON
, O
put O
the O
kettle O
on O
, O
And O
we'll O
all O
have O
tea O
. O
" O
Here O
we O
are O
, O
wife O

didst O
thou O
think O
thou'd O
lost O
us O
? O
" O
quoth O
hearty O
- O
voiced O
Wilson S-PERSON
, O
as O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
women O
rose O
and O
shook O
themselves O
in O
preparation O
for O
their O
homeward O
walk O
. O
Mrs. O
Barton S-PERSON
was O
evidently O
soothed O
, O
if O
not O
cheered O
, O
by O
the O
unburdening O
of O
her O
fears O
and O
thoughts O
to O
her O
friend O
| | O
and O
her O
approving O
look O
went O
far O
to O
second S-ORDINAL
her O
husband's O
invitation O
that O
the O
whole O
party O
should O
adjourn O
from O
Green B-FAC
Heys I-FAC
Fields E-FAC
to O
tea O
, O
at O
the B-FAC
Bartons' I-FAC
house E-FAC
. O
The O
only O
faint O
opposition O
was O
raised O
by O
Mrs. O
Wilson S-PERSON
, O
on O
account O
of O
the O
lateness O
of O
the B-TIME
hour E-TIME
at O
which O
they O
would O
probably O
return O
, O
which O
she O
feared O
on O
her O
babies' O
account O
. O
" O
Now O
, O
hold O
your O
tongue O
, O
missis O
, O
will O
you O
, O
" O
said O
her O
husband O
, O
good O
- O
temperedly O
. O
" O
Don't O
you O
know O
them O
brats O
never O
goes O
to O
sleep O
till O
long O
past O
ten O
? O
and O
haven't O
you O
a O
shawl O
, O
under O
which O
you O
can O
tuck O
one S-CARDINAL
lad's O
head O
, O
as O
safe O
as O
a O
bird's O
under O
its O
wing O
? O
And O
as O
for O
t'other O
one O
, O
I'll S-PERSON
put O
it O
in O
my O
pocket O
rather O
than O
not O
stay O
, O
now O
we O
are O
this O
far O
away O
from O
Ancoats S-GPE
. O
" O
" O
Or O
I O
can O
lend O
you O
another O
shawl O
, O
" O
suggested O
Mrs. O
Barton S-PERSON
. O
" O
Ay O
, O
any O
thing O
rather O
than O
not O
stay O
. O
" O
The O
matter O
being O
decided O
, O
the O
party O
proceeded O
home O
, O
through O
many O
half S-CARDINAL
- O
finished O
streets O
, O
all O
so O
like O
one O
another O
that O
you O
might O
have O
easily O
been O
bewildered O
and O
lost O
your O
way O
. O
Not O
a O
step O
, O
however O
, O
did O
our O
friends O
lose O
| | O
down O
this O
entry O
, O
cutting O
off O
that O
corner O
, O
until O
they O
turned O
out O
of O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
these O
innumerable O
streets O
into O
a O
little O
paved O
court O
, O
having O
the O
backs O
of O
houses O
at O
the O
end O
opposite O
to O
the O
opening O
, O
and O
a O
gutter O
running O
through O
the O
middle O
to O
carry O
off O
household O
slops O
, O
washing O
suds O
, O
&amp O
| | O
c O
. O
The O
women O
who O
lived O
in O
the O
court O
were O
busy O
taking O
in O
strings O
of O
caps O
, O
frocks O
, O
and O
various O
articles O
of O
linen O
, O
which O
hung O
from O
side O
to O
side O
, O
dangling O
so O
low O
, O
that O
if O
our O
friends O
had O
been O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes E-TIME
sooner O
, O
they O
would O
have O
had O
to O
stoop O
very O
much O
, O
or O
else O
the O
half O
- O
wet O
clothes O
would O
have O
flapped O
in O
their O
faces O
| | O
but O
although O
the O
evening O
seemed O
yet O
early O
when O
they O
were O
in O
the O
open O
fields O
— O
among O
the O
pent O
- O
up O
houses O
, O
night O
, O
with O
its O
mists O
, O
and O
its O
darkness O
, O
had O
already O
begun O
to O
fall O
. O
Many O
greetings O
were O
given O
and O
exchanged O
between O
the O
Wilsons S-PERSON
and O
these O
women O
, O
for O
not O
long O
ago O
they O
had O
also O
dwelt O
in O
this O
court O
. O
Two S-CARDINAL
rude O
lads O
, O
standing O
at O
a O
disorderly O
looking O
house O
- O
door O
, O
exclaimed O
, O
as O
Mary B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
( O
the O
daughter O
) O
passed O
, O
" O
Eh O
, O
look O
! O
Polly B-PERSON
Barton's E-PERSON
gotten O
a O
sweetheart O
. O
" O
Of O
course O
this O
referred O
to O
young O
Wilson S-PERSON
, O
who O
stole O
a O
look O
to O
see O
how O
Mary S-PERSON
took O
the O
idea O
. O
He O
saw O
her O
assume O
the O
air O
of O
a O
young O
fury O
, O
and O
to O
his O
next O
speech O
she O
answered O
not O
a O
word O
. O
Mrs. O
Barton S-PERSON
produced O
the O
key O
of O
the O
door O
from O
her O
pocket O
| | O
and O
on O
entering O
the O
house O
- O
place O
it O
seemed O
as O
if O
they O
were O
in O
total O
darkness O
, O
except O
one S-CARDINAL
bright O
spot O
, O
which O
might O
be O
a O
cat's O
eye O
, O
or O
might O
be O
, O
what O
it O
was O
, O
a O
red O
- O
hot O
fire O
, O
smouldering O
under O
a O
large O
piece O
of O
coal O
, O
which O
John B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
immediately O
applied O
himself O
to O
break O
up O
, O
and O
the O
effect O
instantly O
produced O
was O
warm O
and O
glowing O
light O
in O
every O
corner O
of O
the O
room O
. O
To O
add O
to O
this O
( O
although O
the O
coarse O
yellow O
glare O
seemed O
lost O
in O
the O
ruddy O
glow O
from O
the O
fire O
) O
, O
Mrs. O
Barton S-PERSON
lighted O
a O
dip O
by O
sticking O
it O
in O
the O
fire O
, O
and O
having O
placed O
it O
satisfactorily O
in O
a O
tin O
candlestick O
, O
began O
to O
look O
further O
about O
her O
, O
on O
hospitable O
thoughts O
intent O
. O
The O
room O
was O
tolerably O
large O
, O
and O
possessed O
many O
conveniences O
. O
On O
the O
right O
of O
the O
door O
, O
as O
you O
entered O
, O
was O
a O
longish O
window O
, O
with O
a O
broad O
ledge O
. O
On O
each O
side O
of O
this O
, O
hung O
blue O
- O
and O
- O
white O
check O
curtains O
, O
which O
were O
now O
drawn O
, O
to O
shut O
in O
the O
friends O
met O
to O
enjoy O
themselves O
. O
Two S-CARDINAL
geraniums O
, O
unpruned O
and O
leafy O
, O
which O
stood O
on O
the O
sill O
, O
formed O
a O
further O
defence O
from O
out O
- O
door O
pryers O
. O
In O
the O
corner O
between O
the O
window O
and O
the O
fire O
- O
side O
was O
a O
cupboard O
, O
apparently O
full O
of O
plates O
and O
dishes O
, O
cups O
and O
saucers O
, O
and O
some O
more O
nondescript O
articles O
, O
for O
which O
one O
would O
have O
fancied O
their O
possessors O
could O
find O
no O
use O
— O
such O
as O
triangular O
pieces O
of O
glass O
to O
save O
carving O
knives O
and O
forks O
from O
dirtying O
table O
- O
cloths O
. O
However O
, O
it O
was O
evident O
Mrs. O
Barton S-PERSON
was O
proud O
of O
her O
crockery O
and O
glass O
, O
for O
she O
left O
her O
cupboard O
door O
open O
, O
with O
a O
glance O
round O
of O
satisfaction O
and O
pleasure O
. O
On O
the O
opposite O
side O
to O
the O
door O
and O
window O
was O
the O
staircase O
, O
and O
two S-CARDINAL
doors O
| | O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
which O
( O
the O
nearest O
to O
the O
fire O
) O
led O
into O
a O
sort O
of O
little O
back O
kitchen O
, O
where O
dirty O
work O
, O
such O
as O
washing O
up O
dishes O
, O
might O
be O
done O
, O
and O
whose O
shelves O
served O
as O
larder O
, O
and O
pantry O
, O
and O
storeroom O
, O
and O
all O
. O
The O
other O
door O
, O
which O
was O
considerably O
lower O
, O
opened O
into O
the O
coal O
- O
hole O
— O
the O
slanting O
closet O
under O
the O
stairs O
| | O
from O
which O
, O
to O
the O
fire O
- O
place O
, O
there O
was O
a O
gay O
- O
coloured O
piece O
of O
oil O
- O
cloth O
laid O
. O
The O
place O
seemed O
almost O
crammed O
with O
furniture O
( O
sure O
sign O
of O
good O
times O
among O
the O
mills O
) O
. O
Beneath O
the O
window O
was O
a O
dresser O
with O
three S-CARDINAL
deep O
drawers O
. O
Opposite O
the O
fire O
- O
place O
was O
a O
table O
, O
which O
I O
should O
call O
a O
Pembroke S-PRODUCT
, O
only O
that O
it O
was O
made O
of O
deal O
, O
and O
I O
cannot O
tell O
how O
far O
such O
a O
name O
may O
be O
applied O
to O
such O
humble O
material O
. O
On O
it O
, O
resting O
against O
the O
wall O
, O
was O
a O
bright O
green O
japanned O
tea-tray O
, O
having O
a O
couple O
of O
scarlet O
lovers O
embracing O
in O
the O
middle O
. O
The O
fire O
- O
light O
danced O
merrily O
on O
this O
, O
and O
really O
( O
setting O
all O
taste O
but O
that O
of O
a O
child's O
aside O
) O
it O
gave O
a O
richness O
of O
colouring O
to O
that O
side O
of O
the O
room O
. O
It O
was O
in O
some O
measure O
propped O
up O
by O
a O
crimson O
tea-caddy O
, O
also O
of O
japan O
ware O
. O
A O
round O
table O
on O
one S-CARDINAL
branching O
leg O
really O
for O
use O
, O
stood O
in O
the O
corresponding O
corner O
to O
the O
cupboard O
| | O
and O
, O
if O
you O
can O
picture O
all O
this O
with O
a O
washy O
, O
but O
clean O
stencilled O
pattern O
on O
the O
walls O
, O
you O
can O
form O
some O
idea O
of O
John B-PERSON
Barton's E-PERSON
home O
. O
The O
tray O
was O
soon O
hoisted O
down O
, O
and O
before O
the O
merry O
chatter O
of O
cups O
and O
saucers O
began O
, O
the O
women O
disburdened O
themselves O
of O
their O
out O
- O
of O
- O
door O
things O
, O
and O
sent O
Mary S-PERSON
up O

chinking O
of O
money O

to O
which O
Mr. O

busily O

" O
But O
Mary S-PERSON
secretly O
determined O
to O
take O
care O
that O
Alice S-PERSON
brought O
her O
tea-cup O
and O
saucer O
, O
if O
the O
alternative O
was O
to O
be O
her O
sharing O
any O
thing O
with O
Jem S-PERSON
. O
Alice B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
had O
but O
just O
come O
in O
. O
She O
had O
been O
out O
all O
day O
in O
the O
fields O
, O
gathering O
wild O
herbs O
for O
drinks O
and O
medicine O
, O
for O
in O
addition O
to O
her O
invaluable O
qualities O
as O
a O
sick O
nurse O
and O
her O
worldly O
occupation O
as O
a O
washerwoman O
, O
she O
added O
a O
considerable O
knowledge O
of O
hedge O
and O
field O
simples O
| | O
and O
on O
fine O
days O
, O
when O
no O
more O
profitable O
occupation O
offered O
itself O
, O
she O
used O
to O
ramble O
off O
into O
the O
lanes O
and O
meadows O
as O
far O
as O
her O
legs O
could O
carry O
her O
. O
This O
evening O
she O
had O
returned O
loaded O
with O
nettles O
, O
and O
her O
first S-ORDINAL
object O
was O
to O
light O
a O
candle O
and O
see O
to O
hang O
them O
up O
in O
bunches O
in O
every O
available O
place O
in O
her O
cellar O
room O
. O
It O
was O
the O
perfection O
of O
cleanliness O
: O
in O
one S-CARDINAL
corner O
stood O
the O
modest O
- O
looking O
bed O
, O
with O
a O
check O
curtain O
at O
the O
head O
, O
the O
whitewashed O
wall O
filling O
up O
the O
place O
where O
the O
corresponding O
one O
should O
have O
been O
. O
The O
floor O
was O
bricked O
, O
and O
scrupulously O
clean O
, O
although O
so O
damp O
that O
it O
seemed O
as O
if O
the O
last O
washing O
would O
never O
dry O
up O
. O
As O
the O
cellar O
window O
looked O
into O
an O
area O
in O
the O
street O
, O
down O
which O
boys O
might O
throw O
stones O
, O
it O
was O
protected O
by O
an O
outside O
shelter O
, O
and O
was O
oddly O
festooned O
with O
all O
manner O
of O
hedge O
- O
row O
, O
ditch O
, O
and O
field O
plants O
, O
which O
we O
are O
accustomed O
to O
call O
valueless O
, O
but O
which O
have O
a O
powerful O
effect O
either O
for O
good O
or O
for O
evil O
, O
and O
are O
consequently O
much O
used O
among O
the O
poor O
. O
The O
room O
was O
strewed O
, O
hung O
, O
and O
darkened O
with O
these O
bunches O
, O
which O
emitted O
no O
very O
fragrant O
odour O
in O
their O
process O
of O
drying O
. O
In O
one S-CARDINAL
corner O
was O
a O
sort O
of O
broad O
hanging O
shelf O
, O
made O
of O
old O
planks O
, O
where O
some O
old O
hoards O
of O
Alice's S-PRODUCT
were O
kept O
. O
Her O
little O
bit O
of O
crockery O
ware O
was O
ranged O
on O
the O
mantelpiece O
, O
where O
also O
stood O
her O
candlestick O
and O
box O
of O
matches O
. O
A O
small O
cupboard O
contained O
at O
the O
bottom O
coals O
, O
and O
at O
the O
top O
her O
bread O
and O
basin O
of O
oatmeal O
, O
her O
frying O
pan O
, O
tea-pot O
, O
and O
a O
small O
tin O
saucepan O
, O
which O
served O
as O
a O
kettle O
, O
as O
well O
as O
for O
cooking O
the O
delicate O
little O
messes O
of O
broth O
which O
Alice S-PERSON
sometimes O
was O
able O
to O
manufacture O
for O
a O
sick O
neighbour O
. O
After O
her O
walk O
she O
felt O
chilly O
and O
weary O
, O
and O
was O
busy O
trying O
to O
light O
her O
fire O
with O
the O
damp O
coals O
, O
and O
half S-CARDINAL
green O
sticks O
, O
when O
Mary S-PERSON
knocked O
. O
" O
Come O
in O
, O
" O
said O
Alice S-PERSON
, O
remembering O
, O
however O
, O
that O
she O
had O
barred O
the O
door O
for O
the O
night O
, O
and O
hastening O
to O
make O
it O
possible O
for O
any O
one O
to O
come O
in O
. O
" O
Is O
that O
you O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
? O
" O
exclaimed O
she O
, O
as O
the O
light O
from O
her O
candle O
streamed O
on O
the O
girl's O
face O
. O
" O
How O
you O
are O
grown O
since O
I O
used O
to O
see O
you O
at O
my O

in O
, O
lass O
, O

in O

" O
" O
Please O

said O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
almost O
breathless O
, O
" O
mother O
says O
you're O
to O
come O
to O
tea O

you're O
to O
make O
haste O

" O
I'm O
sure O
it's O
very O
neighbourly O
and O
kind O
in O
your O
mother O
, O
and O
I'll O
come O
, O
with O
many O
thanks O
. O
Stay O

Mary S-PERSON
, O
has O
your O
mother O
got O
any O
nettles O
for O

If O
she O

I'll O
take O
her O
some O

" O
No O

I O
don't O
think O
she O

" O
Mary S-PERSON
ran O
off O
like O
a O
hare O
to O
fulfil O
what O
, O
to O
a O
girl O
of O
thirteen S-CARDINAL
, O
fond O
of O
power O
, O
was O
the O
more O
interesting O
part O
of O
her O
errand O
— O
the O
money O
- O
spending O
part O
. O
And O
well O
and O
ably O
did O
she O
perform O
her O
business O
, O
returning O
home O
with O
a O
little O
bottle O
of O
rum O
, O
and O
the O
eggs O
in O
one S-CARDINAL
hand O
, O
while O
her O

was O
filled O
with O
some O
excellent O
red O

white O

flavoured O
Cumberland S-GPE
ham O

wrapped O
up O
in O

She O
was O
at O
home O
, O
and O
frying O

, O
before O
Alice S-PERSON
had O
chosen O
her O
nettles O
, O
put O
out O
her O
candle O
, O
locked O
her O
door O
, O
and O
walked O
in O
a O
very O
foot O
- O
sore O
manner O
as O
far O
as O
John B-PERSON
Barton's E-PERSON
. O
What O
an O
aspect O
of O
comfort O
did O
his O
houseplace O
present O
, O
after O
her O
humble O
cellar O
. O
She O
did O
not O
think O
of O
comparing O

but O
for O
all O
that O
she O
felt O
the O
delicious O
glow O
of O
the O
fire O
, O
the O
bright O
light O
that O
revelled O
in O
every O
corner O
of O
the O
room O
, O
the O
savoury O
smells O

the O
comfortable O
sounds O
of O

boiling O
kettle O

the O
hissing O

With O
a O
little O
old O

fashioned O
curtsey O
she O
shut O
the O

a O
loving O
heart O

boisterous O

surprised O
greeting O

And O
now O
all O
preparations O
being O
made O

the O
party O
sat O
down O

Mrs. O
Wilson S-PERSON

the O
post O
of O
honour O

the O
rocking O
chair O
on O
the O
right O
hand O
side O
of O
the O
fire O

its O
father O

in O
an O
opposite O
arm O

tried O
vainly O

quieten O
the O
other O
with O
bread O
soaked O
in O
milk O
. O
Mrs. O
Barton S-PERSON
knew O
manners O
too O
well O
to O
do O
any O
thing O
but O
sit O
at O
the O
tea-table O
and O
make O
tea O
, O
though O
in O
her O
heart O
she O
longed O
to O
be O
able O
to O
superintend O
the O
frying O
of O
the O
ham O
, O
and O
cast O
many O
an O
anxious O
look O
at O
Mary S-PERSON
as O
she O
broke O
the O
eggs O
and O
turned O
the O
ham O
, O
with O
a O
very O
comfortable O
portion O
of O
confidence O
in O
her O
own O
culinary O
powers O
. O
Jem S-PERSON
stood O
awkwardly O
leaning O
against O
the O
dresser O
, O
replying O
rather O
gruffly O
to O
his O
aunt's O
speeches O
, O
which O
gave O
him O
, O
he O
thought O
, O
the O
air O
of O
being O
a O
little O
boy O
| | O
whereas O
he O
considered O
himself O
as O
a O
young O
man O
, O
and O
not O
so O
very O
young O
neither O
, O
as O
in O
two B-DATE
months E-DATE
he O
would O
be O
eighteen S-DATE
. O
Barton S-PERSON
vibrated O
between O
the O
fire O
and O
the O
tea-table O
, O
his O
only O
drawback O
being O
a O
fancy O
that O
every O
now O
and O
then O
his O
wife's O
face O
flushed O
and O
contracted O
as O
if O
in O
pain O
. O
At O
length O
the O
business O
actually O
began O
. O
Knives O
and O
forks O
, O
cups O
and O
saucers O
made O
a O
noise O
, O
but O
human O
voices O
were O
still O
, O
for O
human O
beings O
were O
hungry O
, O
and O
had O
no O
time O
to O
speak O
. O
Alice S-PERSON
first S-ORDINAL
broke O
silence O
| | O
holding O
her O
tea-cup O
with O
the O
manner O
of O
one O
proposing O
a O
toast O
, O
she O
said O
, O
" O
Here's S-PERSON
to O
absent O
friends O
. O
Friends O
may O
meet O
, O
but O

" O
It O
was O
an O
unlucky O
toast O
or O
sentiment O
, O
as O
she O
instantly O
felt O
. O
Every O
one O
thought O
of O
Esther S-PERSON
, O
the O
absent O
Esther S-PERSON

and O
Mrs. O
Barton S-PERSON
put O
down O
her O
food O
, O
and O
could O
not O
hide O
the O
fast O
dropping O
tears O
. O
Alice S-PERSON
could O
have O
bitten O
her O

though O
all O

in O
the O

her O

So O
George B-PERSON

, O
his O
wife O

children O

set O
off O
early O

expressed O
a O
wish O
that O
such O
meetings O
might O
often O
take O
place O
, O
and O
not O
before O
John B-PERSON

given O
his O
hearty O
consent O

declared O
that O

would O
have O

up O
to O
Mrs. O
Barton S-PERSON

took O
her O
hand O
almost O
humbly O
, O
and O
said O
, O
" O
You O
don't O
know O
how O
sorry O
I O
am O
I O

it O

To O
her O
surprise O
, O
a O
surprise O
that O
brought O
tears O
of O
joy O
into O
her O
eyes O
, O
Mary B-PERSON

put O
her O
arms O
round O
her O
neck O

kissed O
the O
self O

reproaching O
Alice S-PERSON

" O
You O
didn't O
mean O
any O
harm O

it O

time O

as O
Alice S-PERSON

that O
evening O

III O

JOHN S-PERSON
BARTON'S O
GREAT O
TROUBLE O
. O
But O
when O
the O
morn O
came O
dim O
and O
sad O
, O
And O
chill O
with O
early O
showers O
, O
Her O
quiet O
eyelids O
closed O
— O
she O
had O
Another O
morn O
than O
ours O
! O
Hood O
. O
In O
the O
middle O
of O
that O
same O
night O
a O
neighbour O
of O
the O
Bartons S-PERSON
was O
roused O
from O
her O
sound O
, O
well O
- O
earned O
sleep O
, O
by O
a O
knocking O
, O
which O
had O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
made O
part O
of O
her O
dream O
| | O
but O
starting O
up O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
she O
became O
convinced O
of O
its O
reality O
, O
she O
opened O
the O
window O
, O
and O
asked O
who O
was O
there O
? O
" O
Me O
, O
John B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
, O
" O
answered O
he O
, O
in O
a O
voice O
tremulous O
with O
agitation O
. O
" O
My O
missis O
is O
in O
labour O
, O
and O
, O
for O
the O
love O
of O
God O
, O
step O
in O
while O
I O
run O
for O
th' O
doctor O
, O
for O
she's O
fearful O
bad O
. O
" O
While O
the O
woman O
hastily O
dressed O
herself O
, O
leaving O
the O
window O
still O
open O
, O
she O
heard O
cries O
of O
agony O
, O
which O
resounded O
in O
the O
little O
court O
in O
the O
stillness O
of O
the O
night O
. O
In O
less B-TIME
than I-TIME
five I-TIME
minutes E-TIME
she O
was O
standing O
by O
Mrs. O
Barton's S-PERSON
bed O
- O
side O
, O
relieving O
the O
terrified O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
who O
went O
about O
, O
where O
she O
was O
told O
, O
like O
an O
automaton O
| | O
her O
eyes O
tearless O
, O
her O
face O
calm O
, O
though O
deadly O
pale O
, O
and O
uttering O
no O
sound O
, O
except O
when O
her O
teeth O
chattered O
for O
very O
nervousness O
. O
The O
cries O
grew O
worse O
. O
The O
doctor O
was O
very O
long O
in O
hearing O
the O
repeated O
rings O
at O
his O
night O
- O
bell O
, O
and O
still O
longer O
in O
understanding O
who O
it O
was O
that O
made O
this O
sudden O
call O
upon O
his O
services O
| | O
and O
then O
he O
begged O
Barton S-PERSON
just O
to O
wait O
while O
he O
dressed O
himself O
, O
in O
order O
that O
no O
time O
might O
be O
lost O
in O
finding O
the O
court O
and O
house O
. O
Barton S-PERSON
absolutely O
stamped O
with O
impatience O
, O
outside O
the O
doctor's O
door O
, O
before O
he O
came O
down O
| | O
and O
walked O
so O
fast O
homewards O
, O
that O
the O
medical O
man O
several O
times O
asked O
him O
to O
go O
slower O
. O
" O
Is O
she O
so O
very O
bad O
? O
" O
asked O
he O
. O
" O
Worse O
, O
much O
worser O
than O
ever O
I O
saw O
her O
before O
, O
" O
replied O
John S-PERSON
. O
No O
! O
she O
was O
not O
— O
she O
was O
at O
peace O
. O
The O
cries O
were O
still O
for O
ever O
. O
John S-PERSON
had O
no O
time O
for O
listening O
. O
He O
opened O
the O
latched O
door O
, O
stayed O
not O
to O
light O
a O
candle O
for O
the O
mere O
ceremony O
of O
showing O
his O
companion O
up O
the O
stairs O
, O
so O
well O
known O
to O
himself O
| | O
but O
, O
in O
two B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
was O
in O
the O
room O
, O
where O
lay O
the O
dead O
wife O
, O
whom O
he O
had O
loved O
with O
all O
the O
power O
of O
his O
strong O
heart O
. O
The O
doctor O
stumbled O
up O
stairs O
by O
the O
fire O
- O
light O
, O
and O
met O
the O
awe O
- O
struck O
look O
of O
the O
neighbour O
, O
which O
at O
once O
told O
him O
the O
state O
of O
things O
. O
The O
room O
was O
still O
, O
as O
he O
, O
with O
habitual O
tip O
- O
toe O
step O
, O
approached O
the O
poor O
frail O
body O
, O
whom O
nothing O
now O
could O
more O
disturb O
. O
Her O
daughter O
knelt O
by O
the O
bed O
- O
side O
, O
her O
face O
buried O
in O
the O
clothes O
, O
which O
were O
almost O
crammed O
into O
her O
mouth O
, O
to O
keep O
down O
the O
choking O
sobs O
. O
The O
husband O
stood O
like O
one O
stupified O
. O
The O
doctor O
questioned O
the O
neighbour O
in O
whispers O
, O
and O
then O
approaching O
Barton S-PERSON
, O
said O
, O
" O
You O
must O
go O
down O
stairs O
. O
This O
is O
a O
great O
shock O
, O
but O
bear O
it O
like O
a O
man O
. O
Go O
down O
. O
" O
He O
went O
mechanically O
and O
sat O
down O
on O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
chair O
. O
He O
had O
no O
hope O
. O
The O
look O
of O
death O
was O
too O
clear O
upon O
her O
face O
. O
Still O
, O
when O
he O
heard O
one S-CARDINAL
or O
two S-CARDINAL
unusual O
noises O
, O
the O
thought O
burst O
on O
him O
that O
it O
might O
only O
be O
a O
trance O
, O
a O
fit O
, O
a O
— O
he O
did O
not O
well O
know O
what O
, O
— O
but O
not O
death O
! O
Oh O
, O
not O
death O
! O
And O
he O
was O
starting O
up O
to O
go O
up O
stairs O
again O
, O
when O
the O
doctor's O
heavy O
cautious O
creaking O
footstep O
was O
heard O
on O
the O
stairs O
. O
Then O
he O
knew O
what O
it O
really O
was O
in O
the O
chamber O
above O
. O
" O
Nothing O
could O
have O
saved O
her O
— O
there O
has O
been O
some O
shock O
to O
the O
system O
— O
" O
and O
so O
he O
went O
on O
| | O
but O
, O
to O
unheeding O
ears O
, O
which O
yet O
retained O
his O
words O
to O
ponder O
on O
| | O
words O
not O
for O
immediate O
use O
in O
conveying O
sense O
, O
but O
to O
be O
laid O
by O
, O
in O
the O
store O
- O
house O
of O
memory O
, O
for O
a O
more O
convenient O
season O
. O
The O
doctor O
seeing O
the O
state O
of O
the O
case O
, O
grieved O
for O
the O
man O
| | O
and O
, O
very O
sleepy O
, O
thought O
it O
best O
to O
go O
, O
and O
accordingly O
wished O
him O
good O
- O
night O
— O
but O
there O
was O
no O
answer O
, O
so O
he O
let O
himself O
out O
| | O
and O
Barton S-PERSON
sat O
on O
, O
like O
a O
stock O
or O
a O
stone O
, O
so O
rigid O
, O
so O
still O
. O
He O
heard O
the O
sounds O
above O
too O
, O
and O
knew O
what O
they O
meant O
. O
He O
heard O
the O
stiff O
, O
unseasoned O
drawer O
, O
in O
which O
his O
wife O
kept O
her O
clothes O
, O
pulled O
open O
. O
He O
saw O
the O
neighbour O
come O
down O
, O
and O
blunder O
about O
in O
search O
of O
soap O
and O
water O
. O
He O
knew O
well O
what O
she O
wanted O
, O
and O
why O
she O
wanted O
them O
, O
but O
he O
did O
not O
speak O
, O
nor O
offer O
to O
help O
. O
At O
last O
she O
went O
, O
with O
some O
kindly O
- O
meant O
words O
( O
a O
text O
of O
comfort O
, O
which O
fell O
upon O
a O
deafened O
ear O
) O
, O
and O
something O
about O
" O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
" O
but O
which O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
in O
his O
bewildered O
state O
, O
he O
could O
not O
tell O
. O
He O
tried O
to O
realise O
it O
, O
to O
think O
it O
possible O
. O
And O
then O
his O
mind O
wandered O
off O
to O
other O
days O
, O
to O
far O
different O
times O
. O
He O
thought O
of O
their O
courtship O
| | O
of O
his O
first S-ORDINAL
seeing O
her O
, O
an O
awkward O
, O
beautiful O
rustic O
, O
far O
too O
shiftless O
for O
the O
delicate O
factory O
work O
to O
which O
she O
was O
apprenticed O
| | O
of O
his O
first S-ORDINAL
gift O
to O
her O
, O
a O
bead O
necklace O
, O
which O
had O
long O
ago O
been O
put O
by O
, O
in O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
deep O
drawers O
of O
the O
dresser O
, O
to O
be O
kept O
for O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
He O
wondered O
if O
it O
was O
there O
yet O
, O
and O
with O
a O
strange O
curiosity O
he O
got O
up O
to O
feel O
for O
it O
| | O
for O
the O
fire O
by O
this O
time O
was O
well O
- O
nigh O
out O
, O
and O
candle O
he O
had O
none O
. O
His O
groping O
hand O
fell O
on O
the O
piled O
- O
up O
tea O
things O
, O
which O
at O
his O
desire O
she O
had O
left O
unwashed O
till O
morning O
— O
they O
were O
all O
so O
tired O
. O
He O
was O
reminded O
of O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
daily O
little O
actions O
, O
which O
acquire O
such O
power O
when O
they O
have O
been O
performed O
for O
the O
last O
time O
, O
by O
one O
we O
love O
. O
He O
began O
to O
think O
over O
his O
wife's O
daily O
round O
of O
duties O
| | O
and O
something O
in O
the O
remembrance O
that O
these O
would O
never O
more O
be O
done O
by O
her O
, O
touched O
the O
source O
of O
tears O
, O
and O
he O
cried O
aloud O
. O
Poor O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
meanwhile O
, O
had O
mechanically O
helped O
the O
neighbour O
in O
all O
the O
last O
attentions O
to O
the O
dead O
| | O
and O
when O
she O
was O
kissed O
, O
and O
spoken O
to O
soothingly O
, O
tears O
stole O
quietly O
down O
her O
cheeks O
: O
but O
she O
reserved O
the O
luxury O
of O
a O
full O
burst O
of O
grief O
till O
she O
should O
be O
alone O
. O
She O
shut O
the O
chamber O
- O
door O
softly O
, O
after O
the O
neighbour O
had O
gone O
, O
and O
then O
shook O
the O
bed O
by O
which O
she O
knelt O
, O
with O
her O
agony O
of O
sorrow O
. O
She O
repeated O
, O
over O
and O
over O
again O
, O
the O
same O
words O
| | O
the O
same O
vain O
, O
unanswered O
address O
to O
her O
who O
was O
no O
more O
. O
" O
Oh O
, O

are O
you O
really O
dead O
! O
Oh O
, O
mother O
, O
mother O
! O
" O
At O
last O
she O
stopped O
, O
because O
it O
flashed O
across O
her O
mind O
that O
her O
violence O
of O
grief O
might O
disturb O
her O
father O
. O
All O
was O
still O
below O
. O
She O
looked O
on O
the O
face O
so O
changed O
, O
and O
yet O
so O
strangely O
like O
. O
She O
bent O
down O
to O
kiss O
it O
. O
The O
cold O
, O
unyielding O
flesh O
struck O
a O
shudder O
to O
her O
heart O
, O
and O
, O
hastily O
obeying O
her O
impulse O
, O
she O
grasped O
the O
candle O
, O
and O
opened O
the O
door O
. O
Then O
she O
heard O
the O
sobs O
of O
her O
father's O
grief O
| | O
and O
quickly O
, O
quietly O
, O
stealing O
down O
the O
steps O
, O
she O
knelt O
by O
him O
, O
and O
kissed O
his O
hand O
. O
He O
took O
no O
notice O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
, O
for O
his O
burst O
of O
grief O
would O
not O
be O
controlled O
. O
But O
when O
her O
shriller O
sobs O
, O
her O
terrified O
cries O
( O
which O
she O
could O
not O
repress O
) O
, O
rose O
upon O
his O
ear O
, O
he O
checked O
himself O
. O
" O
Child O
, O
we O
must O
be O
all O
to O
one O
another O
, O
now O
she O
is O
gone O
, O
" O
whispered O
he O
. O
" O
Oh O
, O
father O
, O
what O
can O
I O
do O
for O
you O
? O
Do O
tell O
me O

I'll O
do O
any O

Thou O
must O
not O
fret O
thyself O
ill O

the O
first S-ORDINAL

ask O

must O
leave O
me O

go O

don't O
say O
so O

Ay O

thou O
must O

thou O
must O
go O
to O
bed O

have O
enough O

do O

bear O

poor O
wench O

to O

morrow O

" O
Mary S-PERSON
got O
up O
, O
kissed O
her O
father O
, O
and O
sadly O
went O
up O
stairs O
to O
the O
little O
closet O
, O
where O
she O
slept O
. O
She O
thought O
it O
was O
of O
no O
use O
undressing O
, O
for O
that O
she O
could O
never O
, O
never O
sleep O
, O
so O
threw O
herself O
on O
her O
bed O
in O
her O
clothes O
, O
and O
before O
ten B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
had O
passed O
away O
, O
the O
passionate O
grief O
of O
youth O
had O
subsided O
into O
sleep O
. O
Barton S-PERSON
had O
been O
roused O
by O
his O
daughter's O
entrance O
, O
both O
from O
his O
stupor O
and O
from O
his O
uncontrollable O
sorrow O
. O
He O
could O
think O
on O
what O
was O
to O
be O
done O
, O
could O
plan O
for O
the O
funeral O
, O
could O
calculate O
the O
necessity O
of O
soon O
returning O
to O
his O
work O
, O
as O
the O
extravagance O
of O
the O
past O
night O
would O
leave O
them O
short O
of O
money O
, O
if O
he O
long O
remained O
away O
from O
the O
mill O
. O
He O
was O
in O
a O
club O
, O
so O
that O
money O
was O
provided O
for O
the O
burial O
. O
These O
things O
settled O
in O
his O
own O
mind O
, O
he O
recalled O
the O
doctor's O
words O
, O
and O
bitterly O
thought O
of O
the O
shock O
his O
poor O
wife O
had O
so O
recently O
had O
, O
in O
the O
mysterious O
disappearance O
of O
her O
cherished O
sister O
. O
His O
feelings O
towards O
Esther S-PERSON
almost O
amounted O
to O
curses O
. O
It O
was O
she O
who O
had O
brought O
on O
all O
this O
sorrow O
. O
Her O
giddiness O
, O
her O
lightness O
of O
conduct O
, O
had O
wrought O
this O
woe O
. O
His O
previous O
thoughts O
about O
her O
had O
been O
tinged O
with O
wonder O
and O
pity O
, O
but O
now O
he O
hardened O
his O
heart O
against O
her O
for O
ever O
. O
One S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
good O
influences O

the O
ties O

bound O
him O
down O

the O
gentle O
humanities O

earth O
was O
loosened O
, O
and O
henceforward O
the O
neighbours O
all O
remarked O
he O
was O
a O
changed O
man O

His O
gloom O
and O
his O
sternness O
became O
habitual O
instead O
of O
occasional O
. O
He O
was O
more O
obstinate O
. O
But O
never O
to O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
Between O
the O
father O
and O
the O
daughter O

existed O
in O
full O
force O
that O
mysterious O

is O
now O
dead O

While O
he O
was O
harsh O

silent O
to O
others O
, O
he O
humoured O
Mary S-PERSON
with O
tender O
love O

she O
had O
more O
of O
her O
own O
way O
than O
is O
common O
in O
any O
rank O
with O
girls O
of O
her O
age O

Part O
of O
this O
was O
the O
necessity O
of O
the O
case O

for O
, O
of O
course O

all O
the O
money O
went O
through O
her O
hands O

and O
the O
household O
arrangements O
were O
guided O
by O
her O
will O
and O
pleasure O

But O
part O
was O
her O
father's O
indulgence O
, O
for O
he O
left O
her O
, O
with O
full O
trust O

With O
all O
this O

Mary S-PERSON
had O
not O
her O
father's O
confidence O
in O
the O
matters O

now O
began O
to O
occupy O
him O

was O
John B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON

At O
all O
times O
it O
is O
a O
bewildering O
thing O
to O
the O
poor O
weaver O

see O
his O
employer O
removing O
from O
house O

house O

grander O

all O
the O
time O
the O
weaver O
, O
who O
thinks O
he O
and O
his O
fellows O
are O
the O
real O
makers O
of O
this O
wealth O
, O
is O
struggling O
on O
for O
bread O
for O
their O
children O
, O
through O
the O
vicissitudes O
of O
lowered O
wages O

short O
hours O
, O
fewer O
hands O
employed O
, O
&amp O

c O
. O
And O
when O
he O
knows O
trade O
is O
bad O
, O
and O
could O
understand O
( O
at O
least O
partially O
) O
that O
there O
are O
not O
buyers O
enough O
in O
the O
market O
to O
purchase O
the O
goods O
already O
made O
, O
and O
consequently O
that O
there O
is O
no O
demand O
for O
more O
| | O
when O
he O
would O
bear O
and O
endure O
much O
without O
complaining O
, O
could O
he O
also O
see O
that O
his O
employers O
were O
bearing O
their O
share O
| | O
he O
is O
, O
I O
say O
, O
bewildered O
and O
( O
to O
use O
his O
own O
word O
) O
" O
aggravated O
" O
to O
see O
that O
all O
goes O
on O
just O
as O
usual O
with O
the O
mill O
- O
owners O
. O
Large O
houses O
are O
still O
occupied O
, O
while O
spinners O
' O
and O
weavers' O
cottages O
stand O
empty O
, O
because O
the O
families O
that O
once O
occupied O
them O
are O
obliged O
to O
live O
in O
rooms O
or O
cellars O
. O
Carriages O
still O
roll O
along O
the O
streets O
, O
concerts O
are O
still O
crowded O
by O
subscribers O
, O
the O
shops O
for O
expensive O
luxuries O
still O
find O
daily O
customers O
, O
while O
the O
workman O
loiters O
away O
his O
unemployed O
time O
in O
watching O
these O
things O
, O
and O
thinking O
of O
the O
pale O
, O
uncomplaining O
wife O
at O
home O
, O
and O
the O
wailing O
children O
asking O
in O
vain O
for O
enough O
of O
food O
, O
of O
the O
sinking O
health O

of O
the O
dying O
life O
of O
those O
near O

dear O
to O
him O

The O
contrast O
is O
too O
great O
. O
Why O
should O
he O
alone O
suffer O
from O
bad O
times O
? O
I O
know O
that O
this O
is O
not O
really O
the O
case O

and O
I O
know O
what O
is O
the O
truth O
in O
such O
matters O
: O
but O
what O
I O
wish O
to O
impress O
is O
what O
the O
workman O
feels O
and O
thinks O
. O
True O
, O
that O
with O
child O
- O
like O
improvidence O
, O
good O
times O
will O
often O
dissipate O
his O
grumbling O
, O
and O
make O
him O
forget O
all O
prudence O
and O
foresight O
. O
But O
there O
are O
earnest O
men O
among O
these O
people O
, O
men O
who O
have O
endured O
wrongs O
without O
complaining O
, O
but O
without O
ever O
forgetting O
or O
forgiving O
those O
whom O
( O
they O
believe O
) O
have O
caused O
all O
this O
woe O

Among O
these O
was O
John B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
. O
His O
parents O
had O
suffered O
, O
his O
mother O
had O
died O
from O
absolute O
want O
of O
the O
necessaries O
of O
life O

He O
himself O
was O
a O
good O
, O
steady O
workman O
, O
and O
, O
as O
such O
, O
pretty O
certain O
of O
steady O
employment O

But O
he O
spent O
all O
he O
got O
with O
the O
confidence O
( O
you O
may O
also O
call O
it O
improvidence O

of O
one O
who O
was O
willing O

believed O
himself O
able O

to O
supply O
all O
his O
wants O
by O
his O
own O
exertions O

And O
when O
his O
master O
suddenly O
failed O
, O
and O
all O
hands O
in O
that O
mill O

turned O
back O

one B-TIME

only O
a O
few O

he O
had O
good O
heart O

at O
some O
other O
mill O

and O
accordingly O
, O
before O

he O
spent O
some B-TIME
hours E-TIME
in O
going O
from O
factory O

factory O

asking O
for O
work O

But O
at O
every O
mill O
was O
some O
sign O
of O
depression O
of O
trade O

some O
were O
working O
short O

They O
dragged O
him O
through O
the O
crisis O

his O
life O
hung O
on O
a O
gossamer O
thread O

Every O

would O

the O
child O
lingered O
. O
Hungry O
himself O
, O
almost O
to O
an O
animal O
pitch O
of O
ravenousness O
, O
but O
with O
the O
bodily O
pain O
swallowed O
up O
in O
anxiety O
for O
his O
little O
sinking O
lad O
, O
he O
stood O
at O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
shop O
windows O
where O
all O
edible O
luxuries O
are O
displayed O

haunches O

all O
appetising O
sights O
to O
the O
common O

And O
out O
of O
this O
shop O
came O
Mrs. O
Hunter S-PERSON
! O
She O
crossed O
to O
her O
carriage O
, O
followed O
by O
the O
shopman O
loaded O
with O
purchases O
for O
a O
party O

The O
door O
was O
quickly O
slammed O
to O
, O
and O
she O
drove O
away O

and O
Barton S-PERSON
returned O
home O
with O
a O
bitter O
spirit O
of O
wrath O
in O
his O
heart O
, O
to O
see O
his O
only O
boy O
a O
corpse O
! O
You O
can O
fancy O
, O
now O
, O
the O
hoards O
of O
vengeance O
in O
his O
heart O
against O
the O
employers O
. O
For O
there O
are O
never O
wanting O
those O
who O
, O
either O
in O
speech O
or O
in O
print O
, O
find O
it O
their O
interest O
to O
cherish O
such O
feelings O
in O
the O
working O
classes O

who O
know O
how O

when O

rouse O
the O
dangerous O
power O

and O
who O
use O
their O
knowledge O
with O
unrelenting O
purpose O
to O
either O
party O
. O
So O
while O
Mary S-PERSON
took O
her O
own O
way O
, O
growing O
more O
spirited O
every O
day O
, O
and O
growing O
in O
her O
beauty O
too O
, O
her O
father O
was O
chairman O
at O
many O
a O
trades' O
union O
meeting O
| | O
a O
friend O
of O
delegates O

ambitious O
of O
being O
a O
delegate O
himself O

a O
Chartist S-NORP
, O
and O
ready O
to O
do O
any O
thing O
for O
his O
order O
. O
But O
now O
times O
were O
good O
| | O
and O
all O
these O
feelings O
were O
theoretical O
, O
not O
practical O
. O
His O
most O
practical O
thought O
was O
getting O
Mary S-PERSON
apprenticed O
to O
a O
dressmaker O
| | O
for O
he O
had O
never O
left O
off O
disliking O
a O
factory O
life O
for O
a O
girl O
, O
on O
more O
accounts O
than O
one O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
must O
do O
something O
. O
The O
factories O
being O
, O
as O
I O
said O
, O
out O
of O
the O
question O
, O
there O
were O
two S-CARDINAL
things O
open O
— O
going O
out O
to O
service O
, O
and O
the O
dressmaking O
business O
| | O
and O
against O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
of O
these O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
set O
herself O
with O
all O
the O
force O
of O
her O
strong O
will O
. O
What O
that O
will O
might O
have O
been O
able O
to O
achieve O
had O
her O
father O
been O
against O
her O
, O
I O
cannot O
tell O
| | O
but O
he O
disliked O
the O
idea O
of O
parting O
with O
her O
, O
who O
was O
the O
light O
of O
his O
hearth O
, O
the O
voice O
of O
his O
otherwise O
silent O
home O
. O
Besides O
, O
with O
his O
ideas O
and O
feelings O
towards O
the O
higher O
classes O
, O
he O
considered O
domestic O
servitude O
as O
a O
species O
of O
slavery O
| | O
a O
pampering O
of O
artificial O
wants O
on O
the O
one S-CARDINAL
side O
, O
a O
giving O
- O
up O
of O
every O
right O
of O
leisure O
by O
day O
and O
quiet O
rest O
by O
night O
on O
the O
other O
. O
How O
far O
his O
strong O
exaggerated O
feelings O
had O
any O
foundation O
in O
truth O
, O
it O
is O
for O
you O
to O
judge O
. O
I O
am O
afraid O
that O
Mary's S-PERSON
determination O
not O
to O
go O
to O
service O
arose O
from O
far O
less O
sensible O
thoughts O
on O
the O
subject O
than O
her O
father's O
. O
Three B-DATE
years E-DATE
of O
independence O
of O
action O
( O
since O
her O
mother's O
death O
such O
a O
time O
had O
now O
elapsed O
) O
had O
little O
inclined O
her O
to O
submit O
to O
rules O
as O
to O
hours O
and O
associates O
, O
to O
regulate O
her O
dress O
by O
a O
mistress's O
ideas O
of O
propriety O
, O
to O
lose O
the O
dear O
feminine O
privileges O
of O
gossiping O
with O
a O
merry O
neighbour O
, O
and O
working O
night O

help O
one O

was O
sorrowful O

Besides O
all O
this O
, O
the O
sayings O
of O
her O
absent O
, O
her O
mysterious O
aunt O
, O
Esther S-PERSON
, O
had O
an O
unacknowledged O
influence O
over O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
She O
knew O
she O
was O
very O
pretty O

the O
factory O
people O
as O
they O
poured O
from O
the O
mills O
, O
and O
in O
their O
freedom O
told O
the O
truth O
( O
whatever O
it O
might O
be O
) O
to O
every O
passer O
- O
by O
, O
had O
early O
let O
Mary S-PERSON
into O
the O
secret O
of O
her O
beauty O
. O
If O
their O
remarks O
had O
fallen O
on O
an O
unheeding O
ear O
, O
there O
were O
always O
young O
men O
enough O
, O
in O
a O
different O
rank O
from O
her O
own O
, O
who O
were O
willing O
to O
compliment O
the O
pretty O
weaver's O
daughter O
as O
they O
met O
her O
in O
the O
streets O
. O
Besides O
, O
trust O
a O
girl O
of O
sixteen S-DATE
for O
knowing O
well O
if O
she O
is O
pretty O
| | O
concerning O
her O
plainness O
she O
may O
be O
ignorant O
. O
So O
with O
this O
consciousness O
she O
had O
early O
determined O
that O
her O
beauty O
should O
make O
her O
a O
lady O
| | O
the O
rank O
she O
coveted O
the O
more O
for O
her O
father's O
abuse O
| | O
the O
rank O
to O
which O
she O
firmly O
believed O
her O
lost O
aunt O
Esther S-PERSON
had O
arrived O
. O
Now O
, O
while O
a O
servant O
must O
often O
drudge O
and O
be O
dirty O
, O
must O
be O
known O
as O
a O
servant O
by O
all O
who O
visited O
at O
her O
master's O
house O
, O
a O
dressmaker's O
apprentice O
must O
( O
or O
so O
Mary S-PERSON
thought O
) O
be O
always O
dressed O
with O
a O
certain O
regard O
to O
appearance O

must O
never O
soil O
her O
hands O
, O
and O
need O
never O
redden O

dirty O
her O
face O

hard O
labour O

Before O
my O
telling O
you O
so O
truly O
what O
folly O
Mary S-PERSON
felt O
or O
thought O
, O
injures O
her O
without O
redemption O
in O
your O
opinion O

are O

fancies O
of O
sixteen B-DATE

The O
end O
of O
all O
the O
thoughts O
of O
father O
and O
daughter O
was O
, O
as O
I O
said O
before O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
was O
to O
be O
a O
dressmaker O

and O
her O
ambition O
prompted O
her O
unwilling O
father O
to O
apply O
at O
all O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
establishments O
, O
to O
know O
on O
what O
terms O
of O
painstaking O
and O
zeal O
his O
daughter O
might O
be O
admitted O
into O
ever O
so O
humble O
a O
workwoman's O
situation O
. O
But O
high O
premiums O
were O
asked O
at O
all O

poor O
man O
! O
he O
might O
have O
known O
that O
without O
giving O
up O
a O
day's O
work O
to O
ascertain O
the O
fact O
. O
He O
would O
have O
been O
indignant O
, O
indeed O
, O
had O
he O
known O
that O
if O
Mary S-PERSON
had O
accompanied O
him O
, O
the O
case O
might O
have O
been O
rather O
different O
, O
as O
her O
beauty O
would O
have O
made O
her O
desirable O
as O
a O
show O
- O
woman O
. O
Then O
he O
tried O
second S-ORDINAL

rate O
places O

at O
all O
the O
payment O
of O
a O

was O
necessary O
, O
and O
money O
he O
had O
none O

Disheartened O
and O
angry O
he O
went O
home O
at O
night O
, O
declaring O
it O
was O
time O
lost O

that O
dressmaking O
was O
at O
all O
events O
a O
toilsome O
business O

not O
worth O

Mary S-PERSON
saw O
that O
the O
grapes O
were O
sour O

and O
the O
next O

set O
out O

Forgetting O
that O
the O
woman's O
sorrows O
are O
far O
more O
difficult O
to O
mitigate O

a O

by O
the O
mighty O
power O
of O
a O
mother's O
love O

unconscious O

fact O

the O

mourned O

Aunt O
Esther S-PERSON
was O
still O
mysteriously O
absent O

people O
had O
grown O
weary O

Barton S-PERSON
still O
attended O
his O
club O
, O

was O
an O
active O
member O
of O
a O
trades' O
union O

indeed O
, O
more O
frequently O

ever O
, O
since O
the O
time O
of O
Mary's S-PERSON
return O
in O
the O
evening O
was O
so O
uncertain O

, O
as O
she O
occasionally O
, O
in O
very O
busy O
times O

remained O
all O

had O
no O
great O
sympathy O
on O
the O
questions O
that O
agitated O
Barton's S-PERSON
mind O

Still O
their O
hearts O
were O
bound O
by O
old O
ties O
to O
one O
another O
, O
and O
the O
remembrance O
of O
former O
times O
gave O
an O
unspoken O
charm O
to O
their O
meetings O

young O
man O

His O
father O

praising O
Jem S-PERSON

at O
all O
which O
commendation O
pretty O
Mary B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
would O
toss O
her O
head O

clearly O
enough O
that O

wished O

One B-DATE

in O
the O
early O
winter O
time O

when O
people O
were O
provided O
with O
warm O
substantial O
gowns O

not O
likely O
soon O
to O
wear O
out O

when O
, O
accordingly O
, O
business O
was O
rather O
slack O
at O
Miss O
Simmonds S-PERSON
' O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
met O
Alice B-PERSON

coming O
home O
from O
her O
half B-DATE
- I-DATE
day's E-DATE
work O
at O
some O
tradesman's O
house O

Mary S-PERSON
and O
Alice S-PERSON
had O
always O
liked O
each O
other O

indeed O
, O
Alice S-PERSON
looked O
with O
particular O
interest O
on O
the O
motherless O
girl O
, O
the O
daughter O
of O
her O
whose O
forgiving O
kiss O
had O
so O
comforted O
her O
in O
many B-TIME
sleepless I-TIME
hours E-TIME
. O
So O
there O
was O
a O
warm O
greeting O
between O
the O
tidy O
old O
woman O
and O
the O
blooming O
young O
work O
- O
girl O
| | O
and O
then O
Alice S-PERSON
ventured O
to O
ask O
if O
she O
would O
come O
in O
and O
take O
her O
tea O
with O
her O
that O
very O
evening O
. O
" O
You'll O
think O
it O
dull O
enough O
to O
come O
just O
to O
sit O
with O
an O
old O
woman O
like O
me O
, O
but O
there's O
a O
tidy O
young O
lass O
as O
lives O
in O
the O
floor O
above O
, O
who O
does O
plain O
work O
, O
and O
now O
and O
then O
a O
bit O
in O
your O
own O
line O
, O
Mary S-PERSON

she's O
grand O

daughter O
to O
old O
Job B-PERSON
Legh E-PERSON
, O
a O
spinner O

and O
a O
good O
girl O
she O
is O
. O
Do O
come O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
! O
I've O
a O
terrible O
wish O
to O
make O
you O
known O
to O
each O

She's O
a O
genteel O

looking O
lass O

too O

" O
At O
the O
beginning O
of O
this O
speech O
Mary S-PERSON
had O
feared O
the O
intended O
visitor O
was O
to O
be O
no O
other O
than O
Alice's S-PERSON
nephew O

but O
Alice S-PERSON
was O
too O
delicate O
- O
minded O
to O
plan O
a O
meeting O
, O
even O
for O
her O
dear O
Jem S-PERSON
, O
when O
one O
would O
have O
been O
an O
unwilling O
party O
| | O
and O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
relieved O
from O
her O
apprehension O
by O
the O
conclusion O
, O
gladly O
agreed O
to O
come O
. O
How O
busy O
Alice S-PERSON
felt O
! O
it O
was O
not O
often O
she O
had O
any O
one O
to O
tea O
| | O
and O
now O
her O
sense O
of O
the O
duties O
of O
a O
hostess O
were O
almost O
too O
much O
for O
her O
. O
She O
made O
haste O
home O
, O
and O
lighted O
the O
unwilling O
fire O
, O
borrowing O
a O
pair O
of O
bellows O
to O
make O
it O
burn O
the O
faster O
. O
For O
herself O
she O
was O
always O
patient O
| | O
she O
let O
the O
coals O
take O
their O
time O
. O
Then O
she O
put O
on O
her O
pattens O
, O
and O
went O
to O
fill O
her O
kettle O
at O
the O
pump O
in O
the O
next O
court O
, O
and O
on O
the O
way O
she O
borrowed O
a O
cup O

of O
odd O
saucers O
she O
had O
plenty O
, O
serving O
as O
plates O

occasion O
required O

a B-QUANTITY

went O
far O
to O
absorb O
her O
morning's O
wages O

but O
this O
was O
an O
unusual O
occasion O
. O
In O
general O
, O
she O
used O
herb O

tea O
for O
herself O
, O
when O
at O
home O
, O
unless O
some O
thoughtful O
mistress O
made O
her O
a O
present O
of O
tea-leaves O
from O
her O
more O
abundant O
household O

The O
two S-CARDINAL

drawn O
out O

duly O
swept O

she O
knew O
the O
seat O

old O

and O
when O
to O
sit O
lightly O

indeed O
the O
whole O
affair O
was O
more O
for O
apparent O
dignity O

position O
than O
for O
any O
real O
ease O
) O

a O
little O

before O

by O
this O
time O
was O
blazing O
merrily O

away O

all O
these O
preparations O
complete O
, O
Alice S-PERSON
began O
to O
look O
about O
her O
with O
satisfaction O
, O
and O
a O
sort O
of O
wonder O
what O
more O
could O
be O
done O
to O
add O
to O
the O
comfort O
of O
the O
evening O
. O
She O
took O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
chairs O
away O
from O
its O
appropriate O
place O
by O
the O
table O
, O
and O
putting O
it O
close O
to O
the O
broad O
large O
hanging O
shelf O
I O
told O
you O
about O
when O
I O
first S-ORDINAL
described O
her O
cellar O
- O
dwelling O
, O
and O
mounting O
on O
it O
, O
she O
pulled O
towards O
her O
an O
old O
deal O
box O
, O
and O
took O
thence O
a O
quantity O
of O
the O
oat O
bread O
of O
the O
north O
, O
the O
clap O

bread O
of O
Cumberland S-GPE

Westmoreland S-GPE

and O
descending O
carefully O
with O
the O
thin O
cakes O
threatening O
to O
break O
to O
pieces O
in O
her O
hand O
, O
she O
placed O
them O
on O
the O
bare O
table O
, O
with O
the O
belief O
that O
her O
visitors O
would O
have O
an O
unusual O
treat O
in O
eating O
the O
bread O
of O
her O
childhood O
. O
She O
brought O
out O
a O
good O
piece O
of O
a O
four B-QUANTITY
- I-QUANTITY
pound E-QUANTITY
loaf O
of O
common O
household O
bread O
as O
well O
, O
and O
then O
sat O
down O
to O
rest O
, O
really O
to O
rest O
, O
and O
not O
to O
pretend O

on O
one O

the O
rush O

chairs O

candle O
was O
ready O
to O
be O
lighted O
, O
the O
kettle O
boiled O

tea O
was O
awaiting O
its O
doom O
in O
its O
paper O

all O
was O
ready O

A O
knock O
at O
the O
door O
! O
It O
was O
Margaret S-PERSON
, O
the O
young O
workwoman O
who O
lived O
in O
the O
rooms O
above O
, O
who O
having O
heard O
the O
bustle O
, O
and O
the O
subsequent O
quiet O
, O
began O
to O
think O
it O
was O
time O
to O
pay O
her O
visit O
below O
. O
She O
was O
a O
sallow O
, O
unhealthy O
, O
sweet O
- O
looking O
young O
woman O
, O
with O
a O
careworn O
look O
| | O
her O
dress O
was O
humble O
and O
very O
simple O
, O
consisting O
of O
some O
kind O
of O
dark O
stuff O
gown O
, O
her O
neck O
being O
covered O
by O
a O
drab O
shawl O
or O
large O
handkerchief O
, O
pinned O
down O
behind O
and O
at O
the O
sides O
in O
front O
. O
The O
old O
woman O
gave O
her O
a O
hearty O
greeting O
, O
and O
made O
her O
sit O
down O
on O
the O
chair O
she O
had O
just O
left O
, O
while O
she O
balanced O
herself O
on O
the O
board O
seat O
, O
in O
order O
that O
Margaret S-PERSON
might O
think O
it O
was O
quite O
her O
free O
and O
independent O
choice O
to O
sit O
there O
. O
" O
I O
cannot O
think O
what O
keeps O
Mary B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
. O
She's S-PERSON
quite O
grand O
with O
her O
late B-TIME
hours E-TIME
, O
" O
said O
Alice S-PERSON
, O
as O
Mary S-PERSON
still O
delayed O
. O
The O
truth O
was O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
was O
dressing O
herself O
| | O
yes O
, O
to O
come O
to O
poor O
old O
Alice's S-PERSON
— O
she O
thought O
it O
worth O
while O
to O
consider O
what O
gown O
she O
should O
put O
on O
. O
It O
was O
not O
for O
Alice S-PERSON
, O
however O
, O
you O
may O
be O
pretty O
sure O
| | O
no O
, O
they O
knew O
each O
other O
too O
well O
. O
But O
Mary S-PERSON
liked O
making O
an O
impression O
, O
and O
in O
this O
it O
must O
be O
owned O
she O
was O
pretty O
often O
gratified O
— O
and O
there O
was O
this O
strange O
girl O
to O
consider O
just O
now O
. O
So O
she O
put O
on O
her O
pretty O
new O
blue O
merino O
, O
made O
tight O
to O
her O
throat O
, O
her O
little O
linen O
collar O
and O
linen O
cuffs O
, O
and O
sallied O
forth O
to O
impress O
poor O
gentle O
Margaret S-PERSON
. O
She O
certainly O
succeeded O
. O
Alice S-PERSON
, O
who O
never O
thought O
much O
about O
beauty O
, O
had O
never O
told O
Margaret S-PERSON
how O
pretty O
Mary S-PERSON
was O
| | O
and O
, O
as O
she O
came O
in O
half O
- O
blushing O
at O
her O
own O
self O
- O
consciousness O
, O
Margaret S-PERSON
could O
hardly O
take O
her O
eyes O
off O
her O
, O
and O
Mary S-PERSON
put O
down O
her O
long O
black O
lashes O
with O
a O
sort O
of O
dislike O
of O
the O
very O
observation O
she O
had O
taken O
such O
pains O
to O
secure O
. O
Can O
you O
fancy O
the O
bustle O
of O
Alice S-PERSON
to O
make O
the O
tea O
, O
to O
pour O
it O
out O
, O
and O
sweeten O
it O
to O
their O
liking O
, O
to O
help O
and O
help O
again O
to O
clap O
- O
bread O
and O
bread O
- O
and O
- O
butter O
? O
Can O
you O
fancy O
the O
delight O
with O
which O
she O
watched O
her O
piled O
- O
up O
clap O
- O
bread O
disappear O
before O
the O
hungry O
girls O
, O
and O
listened O
to O
the O
praises O

a O
little O

of O
what O
I O

Sir O
J. B-PERSON
E. I-PERSON
Smith E-PERSON
, O
being O
on O
a O
visit O
to O
Roscoe S-GPE
, O
of O
Liverpool S-GPE
, O
made O
some O
inquiries O
from O
him O
as O
to O
the O
habitat O
of O
a O
very O
rare O
plant O
, O
said O
to O
be O
found O
in O
certain O
places O
in O
Lancashire S-GPE
. O
Mr. O
Roscoe S-PERSON
knew O
nothing O
of O
the O
plant O

but O
stated O
, O
that O
if O
any O
one O
could O
give O
him O
the O
desired O
information O
, O
it O
would O
be O
a O
hand O
- O
loom O
weaver O
in O
Manchester S-GPE
, O
whom O
he O
named O
. O
Sir O
J. B-PERSON
E. I-PERSON
Smith E-PERSON
proceeded O
by O
coach O
to O
Manchester S-GPE
, O
and O
on O
arriving O
at O
that O
town O
, O
he O
inquired O
of O
the O
porter O
who O
was O
carrying O
his O
luggage O
if O
he O
could O
direct O
him O
to O
So O
and O
So O
. O
" O
Oh O
, O
yes O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
man O
. O
" O
He O
does O
a O
bit O
in O
my O
way O
| | O
" O
and O
, O
on O
further O
investigation O
, O
it O
turned O
out O
, O
that O
both O
the O
porter O
, O
and O
his O
friend O
the O
weaver O
, O
were O
skilful O
botanists O
, O
and O
able O
to O
give O
Sir O
J. B-PERSON
E. I-PERSON
Smith E-PERSON
the O
very O
information O
which O
he O
wanted O
. O
Such O
are O
the O
tastes O
and O
pursuits O
of O
some O
of O
the O
thoughtful O
, O
little O
understood O
, O
working O
men O
of O
Manchester S-GPE
. O
And O
Margaret's S-PERSON
grandfather O
was O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
these O
. O
He O
was O
a O
little O
wiry O
- O
looking O
old O
man O
, O
who O
moved O
with O
a O
jerking O
motion O
, O
as O
if O
his O
limbs O
were O
worked O
by O
a O
string O
like O
a O
child's O
toy O
, O
with O
dun O
coloured O
hair O
lying O
thin O
and O
soft O
at O
the O
back O
and O
sides O
of O
his O
head O
| | O
his O
forehead O
was O
so O
large O
it O
seemed O
to O
overbalance O
the O
rest O
of O
his O
face O
, O
which O
had O
indeed O
lost O
its O
natural O
contour O
by O
the O
absence O
of O
all O
the O
teeth O
. O
The O
eyes O
absolutely O
gleamed O
with O
intelligence O
| | O
so O
keen O
, O
so O
observant O
, O
you O
felt O
as O
if O
they O
were O
almost O
wizard O
- O
like O
. O
Indeed O
, O
the O
whole O
room O
looked O
not O
unlike O
a O
wizard's O
dwelling O
. O
Instead O
of O
pictures O
were O
hung O
rude O
wooden O
frames O
of O
impaled O
insects O
| | O
the O
little O
table O
was O
covered O
with O
cabalistic O
books O
| | O
and O
a O
case O
of O
mysterious O
instruments O
lay O
beside O
, O
one O
of O
which O
Job B-PERSON
Legh E-PERSON
was O
using O
when O
his O
grand O
- O
daughter O
entered O
. O
On O
her O
appearance O
he O
pushed O
his O
spectacles O
up O
so O
as O
to O
rest O
midway O
on O
his O
forehead O
, O
and O
gave O
Mary S-PERSON
a O
short O
, O
kind O
welcome O
. O
But O
Margaret S-PERSON
he O
caressed O
as O
a O
mother O
caresses O
her O
first S-ORDINAL
- O
born O
| | O
stroking O
her O
with O
tenderness O
, O
and O
almost O
altering O
his O
voice O
as O
he O
spoke O
to O
her O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
looked O
round O
on O
the O
odd O
, O
strange O
things O
she O
had O
never O
seen O
at O
home O
, O
and O
which O
seemed O
to O
her O
to O
have O
a O
very O
uncanny O
look O
. O
" O
Is O
your O
grandfather O
a O
fortune O
- O
teller O
? O
" O
whispered O
she O
to O
her O
new O
friend O
. O
" O
No O
, O
" O
replied O
Margaret S-PERSON
, O
in O
the O
same O
voice O
| | O
" O
but O
you're O
not O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
as O
has O
taken O
him O
for O
such O
. O
He O
is O
only O
fond O
of O
such O
things O
as O
most O
folks O
know O
nothing O
about O
. O
" O
" O
And O
do O
you O
know O
aught O
about O
them O
, O
too O
? O
" O
" O
I O
know O
a O
bit O
about O
some O
of O
the O
things O
grandfather O
is O
fond O
on O
| | O
just O
because O
he's O
fond O
on O
' O
em O
I O
tried O
to O
learn O
about O
them O
. O
" O
" O
What O
things O
are O
these O
? O
" O
said O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
struck O
with O
the O
weird O
looking O
creatures O
that O
sprawled O
around O
the O
room O
in O
their O
roughly O
- O
made O
glass O
cases O
. O
But O
she O
was O
not O
prepared O
for O
the O
technical O
names O
which O
Job B-PERSON
Legh E-PERSON
pattered O
down O
on O
her O
ear O
, O
on O
which O
they O
fell O
like O
hail O
on O
a O
skylight O
| | O
and O
the O
strange O
language O
only O
bewildered O
her O
more O
than O
ever O
. O
Margaret S-PERSON
saw O
the O
state O
of O
the O
case O
, O
and O
came O
to O
the O
rescue O
. O
" O
Look O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
at O
this O
horrid O
scorpion O
. O
He O
gave O
me O
such O
a O
fright O
: O
I'm O
all O
of O
a O
twitter O
yet O
when O
I O
think O
of O
it O
. O
Grandfather O
went O
to O
Liverpool S-GPE
one B-DATE
Whitsun I-DATE
- I-DATE
week E-DATE
to O
go O
strolling O
about O
the O
docks O
and O
pick O
up O
what O
he O
could O
from O
the O
sailors O
, O
who O
often O
bring O
some O
queer O
thing O
or O
another O
from O
the O
hot O
countries O
they O
go O
to O

and O
so O
he O
sees O
a O
chap O
with O
a O
bottle O
in O
his O
hand O
, O
like O
a O
druggist's O
physic O
- O
bottle O

and O
says O
grandfather O
, O
' O
What O
have O
ye O
gotten O
there O
? O
' O
So O
the O
sailor O
holds O
it O
up O
, O
and O
grandfather O
knew O
it O
was O
a O
rare O
kind O
o' O
scorpion O
, O
not O
common O
even O
in O
the B-LOC
East I-LOC
Indies E-LOC
where O
the O
man O
came O
from O

says O
he O
, O
' O
How O
did O
ye O
catch O
this O
fine O
fellow O

for O
he O
wouldn't O
be O
taken O
for O
nothing O
I'm O
thinking O

' O
And O
the O
man O
said O
as O
how O
when O
they O
were O
unloading O
the O
ship O
he'd O
found O
him O
lying O
behind O
a O
bag O
of O
rice O
, O
and O
he O
thought O
the O
cold O
had O
killed O
him O
, O
for O
he O
was O
not O
squashed O
nor O
injured O
a O
bit O

He O
did O
not O
like O
to O
part O
with O
any O
of O
the O
spirit O
out O
of O
his O
grog O
to O
put O
the O
scorpion O
in O
, O
but O
slipped O
him O
into O
the O
bottle O
, O
knowing O
there O
were O
folks O
enow O
who O
would O
give O
him O
something O
for O
him O

So O
grandfather O
gives O
him O
a O
shilling O

" O
" O
Two S-CARDINAL
shilling O

" O

Job B-PERSON
Legh E-PERSON
, O
" O
and O
a O
good O
bargain O
it O
was O
. O
" O
" O
Well O
! O
grandfather O
came O
home O
as O
proud O
as O
Punch S-PERSON
, O
and O
pulled O
the O
bottle O
out O
of O
his O
pocket O

But O
you O
see O
th' O
scorpion O
were O
doubled O
up O
, O
and O
grandfather O
thought O
I O
couldn't O
fairly O
see O
how O
big O
he O
was O

So O
he O
shakes O
him O
out O
right O
before O
the O
fire O

a O
good O
warm O
one O
it O
was O

for O
I O
was O
ironing O

I O
remember O

I O
left O
off O

stooped O
down O
over O
him O
, O
to O
look O
at O
him O
better O
, O
and O
grandfather O
got O
a O
book O
, O
and O
began O
to O
read O
how O
this O
very O
kind O
were O
the O
most O
poisonous O
and O
vicious O
species O
, O
how O
their O
bite O
were O
often O
fatal O
, O
and O
then O
went O
on O
to O
read O
how O
people O
who O
were O
bitten O
got O
swelled O
, O
and O
screamed O
with O
pain O
. O
I O
was O
listening O
hard O

as O
it O
fell O
out O

I O
never O
took O
my O

off O

' O
told O
I O
was O
watching O
it O
. O
Suddenly O
it O
seemed O
to O
give O
a O
jerk O
, O
and O
before O
I O
could O
speak O
, O
it O
gave O
another O
, O
and O
in O
a O
minute O
it O
was O
as O
wild O
as O
could O
be O
, O
running O
at O
me O
just O
like O
a O
mad O
dog O
. O
" O
" O
What O
did O
you O
do O
? O
" O
asked O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
" O
Me O
! O
why O
, O
I O
jumped O
first S-ORDINAL
on O
a O
chair O
, O
and O
then O
on O
all O
the O
things O
I'd O
been O
ironing O
on O
the O
dresser O
, O
and O
I O
screamed O
for O
grandfather O
to O
come O
up O
by O
me O
, O
but O
he O
did O
not O
hearken O
to O
me O
. O
" O
" O
Why O
, O
if O
I'd O
come O
up O
by O
thee O
, O
who'd O
ha O
' O
caught O
the O
creature O
, O
I O
should O
like O
to O
know O
? O
" O
" O
Well O
, O
I O
begged O
grandfather O
to O
crush O
it O
, O
and O
I O
had O
the O
iron O
right O
over O
it O
once O
, O
ready O
to O
drop O
, O
but O
grandfather O
begged O
me O
not O
to O
hurt O
it O
in O
that O
way O
. O
So O
I O
couldn't O
think O
what O
he'd O
have O
, O
for O
he O
hopped O
round O
the O
room O
as O
if O
he O
were O
sore O
afraid O
, O
for O
all O
he O
begged O
me O
not O
to O
injure O
it O
. O
At O
last O
he O
goes O
to O
th' O
kettle O
, O
and O
lifts O
up O
the O
lid O
, O
and O
peeps O
in O
. O
What O
on O
earth O
is O
he O
doing O
that O
for O
, O
thinks O
I O
| | O
he'll O
never O
drink O
his O
tea O
with O
a O
scorpion O
running O
free O
and O
easy O
about O
the O
room O
. O
Then O
he O
takes O
the O
tongs O
, O
and O
he O
settles O
his O
spectacles O
on O
his O
nose O
, O
and O
in O
a O
minute O
he O
had O
lifted O
the O
creature O
up O
by O
th' O
leg O
, O
and O
dropped O
him O
into O
the O
boiling O
water O
. O
" O
" O
And O
did O
that O
kill O
him O
? O
" O
said O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
" O
Ay O
, O
sure O
enough O
| | O
he O
boiled O
for O
longer O
time O
than O
grandfather O
liked O
though O
. O
But O
I O
was O
so O
afeard O
of O
his O
coming O
round O
again O
. O
I O
ran O
to O
the O
public O
- O
house O
for O
some O
gin O
, O
and O
grandfather O
filled O
the O
bottle O
, O
and O
then O
we O
poured O
off O
the O
water O
, O
and O
picked O
him O
out O
of O
the O
kettle O
, O
and O
dropped O
him O
into O
the O
bottle O
, O
and O
he O
were O
there O
above O
a O
twelvemonth O
. O
" O
" O
What O
brought O
him O
to O
life O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
? O
" O
asked O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
" O
Why O
, O
you O
see O
, O
he O
were O
never O
really O
dead O
, O
only O
torpid O
— O
that O
is O
, O
dead O
asleep O
with O
the O
cold O
, O
and O
our O
good O
fire O
brought O
him O
round O
. O
" O
" O
I'm O
glad O
father O
does O
not O
care O
for O
such O
things O
, O
" O
said O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
" O
Are O
you O
! O
Well O
, O
I'm O
often O
downright O
glad O
grandfather O
is O
so O
fond O
of O
his O
books O
, O
and O
his O
creatures O
, O
and O
his O
plants O
. O
It O
does O
my O
heart O
good O
to O
see O
him O
so O
happy O
, O
sorting O
them O
all O
at O
home O
, O
and O
so O
ready O
to O
go O
in O
search O
of O
more O
, O
whenever O
he's O
a O
spare O
day O
. O
Look O
at O
him O
now O
! O
he's O
gone O
back O
to O
his O
books O
, O
and O
he'll O
be O
as O
happy O
as O
a O
king O
, O
working O
away O
till O
I O
make O
him O
go O
to O
bed O
. O
It O
keeps O
him O
silent O
, O
to O
be O
sure O
| | O
but O
so O
long O
as O
I O
see O
him O
earnest O
, O
and O
pleased O
, O
and O
eager O
, O
what O
does O
that O
matter O
? O
Then O
, O
when O
he O
has O
his O
talking O
bouts O
, O
you O
can't O
think O
how O
much O
he O
has O
to O
say O
. O
Dear O
grandfather O
! O
you O
don't O
know O
how O
happy O
we O
are O
! O
" O
Mary S-PERSON
wondered O
if O
the O
dear O
grandfather O
heard O
all O
this O
, O
for O
Margaret S-PERSON
did O
not O
speak O
in O
an O
under O
tone O
| | O
but O
no O
! O
he O
was O
far O
too O
deep O
and O
eager O
in O
solving O
a O
problem O
. O
He O
did O
not O
even O
notice O
Mary's S-PERSON
leave O
- O
taking O
, O
and O
she O
went O
home O
with O
the O
feeling O
that O
she O
had O
that O
night O
made O
the O
acquaintance O
of O
two S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
strangest O
people O
she O
ever O
saw O
in O
her O
life O
. O
Margaret S-PERSON
, O
so O
quiet O
, O
so O
common O
place O
, O
until O
her O
singing O
powers O
were O
called O
forth O
| | O
so O
silent O
from O
home O
, O
so O
cheerful O
and O
agreeable O
at O
home O
| | O
and O
her O
grandfather O
so O
very O
different O
to O
any O
one O
Mary S-PERSON
had O
ever O
seen O
. O
Margaret S-PERSON
had O
said O
he O
was O
not O
a O
fortune O
- O
teller O
, O
but O
she O
did O
not O
know O
whether O
to O
believe O
her O
. O
To O
resolve O
her O
doubts O
, O
she O
told O
the O
history O
of O
the O
evening O
to O
her O
father O
, O
who O
was O
interested O
by O
her O
account O
, O
and O
curious O
to O
see O
and O
judge O
for O
himself O
. O
Opportunities O
are O
not O
often O
wanting O
where O
inclination O
goes O
before O
, O
and O
ere O
the O
end O
of O
that O
winter O
Mary S-PERSON
looked O
upon O
Margaret S-PERSON
almost O
as O
an O
old O
friend O
. O
The O
latter O
would O
bring O
her O
work O
when O
Mary S-PERSON
was O
likely O
to O
be O
at O
home O
in O
the O
evenings O
and O
sit O
with O
her O
| | O
and O
Job B-PERSON
Legh E-PERSON
would O
put O
a O
book O
and O
his O
pipe O
in O
his O
pocket O
and O
just O
step O
round O
the O
corner O
to O
fetch O
his O
grand O
- O
child O
, O
ready O
for O
a O
talk O
if O
he O
found O
Barton S-PERSON
in O
| | O
ready O
to O
pull O
out O
pipe O
and O
book O
if O
the O
girls O
wanted O
him O
to O
wait O
, O
and O
John S-PERSON
was O
still O
at O
his O
club O
. O
In O
short O
, O
ready O
to O
do O
whatever O
would O
give O
pleasure O
to O
his O
darling O
Margaret S-PERSON
. O
I O
do O
not O
know O
what O
points O
of O
resemblance O
( O
or O
dissimilitude O
, O
for O
the O
one O
joins O
people O
as O
often O
as O
the O
other O
) O
attracted O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
girls O
to O
each O
other O
. O
Margaret S-PERSON
had O
the O
great O
charm O
of O
possessing O
good O
strong O
common O
sense O
, O
and O
do O
you O
not O
perceive O
how O
involuntarily O
this O
is O
valued O
? O
It O
is O
so O
pleasant O
to O
have O
a O
friend O
who O
possesses O
the O
power O
of O
setting O
a O
difficult O
question O
in O
a O
clear O
light O
| | O
whose O
judgment O
can O
tell O
what O
is O
best O
to O
be O
done O
| | O
and O
who O
is O
so O
convinced O
of O
what O
is O
" O
wisest O
, O
best O
, O
" O
that O
in O
consideration O
of O
the O
end O
, O
all O
difficulties O
in O
the O
way O
diminish O
. O
People O
admire O
talent O
, O
and O
talk O
about O
their O
admiration O
. O
But O
they O
value O
common O
sense O
without O
talking O
about O
it O
, O
and O
often O
without O
knowing O
it O
. O
So O
Mary S-PERSON
and O
Margaret S-PERSON
grew O
in O
love O
one O
toward O
the O
other O
| | O
and O
Mary S-PERSON
told O
many O
of O
her O
feelings O
in O
a O
way O
she O
had O
never O
done O
before O
to O
any O
one O
. O
Most O
of O
her O
foibles O
also O
were O
made O
known O
to O
Margaret S-PERSON
, O
but O
not O
all O
. O
There O
was O
one S-CARDINAL
cherished O
weakness O
still O
concealed O
from O
every O
one O
. O
It O
concerned O
a O
lover O
, O
not O
beloved O
, O
but O
favoured O
by O
fancy O
. O
A O
gallant O
, O
handsome O
young O
man O
| | O
but O
— O
not O
beloved O
. O
Yet O
Mary S-PERSON
hoped O
to O
meet O
him O
every O
day O
in O
her O
walks O
, O
blushed O
when O
she O
heard O
his O
name O
, O
and O
tried O
to O
think O
of O
him O
as O
her O
future O
husband O
, O
and O
above O
all O
, O
tried O
to O
think O
of O
herself O
as O
his O
future O
wife O
. O
Alas O
! O
poor O
Mary S-PERSON
! O
Bitter O
woe O
did O
thy O
weakness O
work O
thee O
. O
She O
had O
other O
lovers O
. O
One S-CARDINAL
or O
two S-CARDINAL
would O
gladly O
have O
kept O
her O
company O
, O
but O
she O
held O
herself O
too O
high O
, O
they O
said O
. O
Jem B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
said O
nothing O
, O
but O
loved O
on O
and O
on O
, O
ever O
more O
fondly O
| | O
he O
hoped O
against O
hope O
| | O
he O
would O
not O
give O
up O
, O
for O
it O
seemed O
like O
giving O
up O
life O
to O
give O
up O
thought O
of O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
He O
did O
not O
dare O
to O
look O
to O
any O
end O
of O
all O
this O
| | O
the O
present O
, O
so O
that O
he O
saw O
her O
, O
touched O
the O
hem O
of O
her O
garment O
, O
was O
enough O
. O
Surely O
, O
in O
time O
, O
such O
deep O
love O
would O
beget O
love O
. O
He O
would O
not O
relinquish O
hope O
, O
and O
yet O
her O
coldness O
of O
manner O
was O
enough O
to O
daunt O
any O
man O
| | O
and O
it O
made O
Jem S-PERSON
more O
despairing O
than O
he O
would O
acknowledge O
for O
a O
long O
time O
even O
to O
himself O
. O
But O
one B-TIME
evening E-TIME
he O
came O
round O
by O
Barton's S-PERSON
house O
, O
a O
willing O
messenger O
for O
his O
father O
, O
and O
opening O
the O
door O
saw O
Margaret S-PERSON
sitting O
asleep O
before O
the O
fire O
. O
She O
had O
come O
in O
to O
speak O
to O
Mary S-PERSON
| | O
and O
worn O
out O
by O
a O
long O
working O
, O
watching O
night O
, O
she O
fell O
asleep O
in O
the O
genial O
warmth O
. O
An O
old O
- O
fashioned O
saying O
about O
a O
pair O
of O
gloves O
came O
into O
Jem's S-PERSON
mind O
, O
and O
stepping O
gently O
up O
he O
kissed O
Margaret S-PERSON
with O
a O
friendly O
kiss O
. O
She O
awoke O
, O
and O
perfectly O
understanding O
the O
thing O
, O
she O
said O
, O
" O
For O
shame O
of O
yourself O
, O
Jem S-PERSON
! O
What O
would O
Mary S-PERSON
say O
? O
" O
Lightly O
said O
, O
lightly O
answered O
. O
" O
She'd O
nobbut O
say O
, O
practice O
makes O
perfect O
. O
" O
And O
they O
both O
laughed O
. O
But O
the O
words O
Margaret S-PERSON
had O
said O
rankled O
in O
Jem's S-PERSON
mind O
. O
Would O
Mary S-PERSON
care O
? O
Would O
she O
care O
in O
the O
very O
least O
? O
They O
seemed O
to O
call O
for O
an O
answer O
by O
night O
, O
and O
by O
day O
| | O
and O
Jem S-PERSON
felt O
that O
his O
heart O
told O
him O
Mary S-PERSON
was O
quite O
indifferent O
to O
any O
action O
of O
his O
. O
Still O
he O
loved O
on O
, O
and O
on O
, O
ever O
more O
fondly O
. O
Mary's S-PERSON
father O
was O
well O
aware O
of O
the O
nature O
of O
Jem B-PERSON
Wilson's E-PERSON
feelings O
for O
his O
daughter O
, O
but O
he O
took O
no O
notice O
of O
them O
to O
any O
one O
, O
thinking O
Mary S-PERSON
full O
young O
yet O
for O
the O
cares O
of O
married O
life O
, O
and O
unwilling O
, O
too O
, O
to O
entertain O
the O
idea O
of O
parting O
with O
her O
at O
any O
time O
, O
however O
distant O
. O
But O
he O
welcomed O
Jem S-PERSON
at O
his O
house O
, O
as O
he O
would O
have O
done O
his O
father's O
son O
, O
whatever O
were O
his O
motives O
for O
coming O
| | O
and O
now O
and O
then O
admitted O
the O
thought O
, O
that O
Mary S-PERSON
might O
do O
worse O
when O
her O
time O
came O
, O
than O
marry O

she O
said O
that O

" O
The O
weary O
sound O
of O
stitching O
was O
the O
only O
sound O
heard O
for O
a O
little O
while O
, O
till O
Mary S-PERSON
inquired O
, O
" O

you O
expect O

paid O

mourning O

I O
do O
not O
much O

shall O

I've O
thought O
it O
over O
once O

myself O

do O
it O

my O
bit O
towards O
comforting O
them O

I O
don't O
think O
they O
can O
pay O

yet O
they're O
just O
the O
sort O
of O
folk O
to O
have O
their O
minds O
easier O
for O
wearing O
mourning O

There's O
only O
one S-CARDINAL
thing O
I O
dislike O
making O
black O
for O

it O
does O
so O
hurt O
the O
eyes O

" O
Margaret S-PERSON
put O
down O
her O
work O

a O
sigh O

shaded O
her O

she O
assumed O
a O
cheerful O
tone O

said O

not O

do O
you O
know O

a O
little O
blind O

She O
fell O
into O
an O
agony O

tears O

knelt O
by O
her O
, O
striving O
to O
soothe O

to O
comfort O
her O

, O
like O
an O

rather O
to O
deny O
the O
correctness O
of O

helping O
her O

evil O

" O
No O

quietly O
fixing O
her O
tearful O
eyes O
on O
Mary S-PERSON

" O
I O
know O
I'm O
not O
mistaken O
. O
I O
have O
felt O
one O
going O
some O
time O
, O
long O
before O
I O
ever O
thought O
what O
it O
would O
lead O
to O

and O
last O
autumn O
I O
went O
to O
a O
doctor O

and O
he O
did O
not O
mince O
the O
matter O
, O
but O
said O
unless O
I O
sat O
in O
a O
darkened O
room O
, O
with O
my O
hands O
before O
me O
, O
my O
sight O
would O
not O
last O
me O
many O
years O
longer O
. O
But O
how O
could O
I O
do O
that O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
? O
For O
one S-CARDINAL
thing O
, O
grandfather O
would O
have O
known O
there O
was O
somewhat O
the O
matter O

and O
, O
oh O
! O
it O
will O
grieve O
him O
sore O
whenever O
he's O
told O
, O
so O
the O
later O
the O
better O
| | O
and O
besides O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
we've O
sometimes O
little O
enough O
to O
go O
upon O
, O
and O
what O
I O
earn O
is O
a O
great O
help O
. O
For O
grandfather O
takes O
a O
day O
here O
, O
and O
a O
day O
there O
, O
for O
botanising O
or O
going O
after O
insects O
, O
and O
he'll O
think O
little O
enough O
of O
four B-MONEY
or I-MONEY
five I-MONEY
shillings E-MONEY
for O
a O
specimen O
| | O
dear O
grandfather O
! O
and O
I'm O
so O
loath O
to O
think O
he O
should O
be O
stinted O
of O
what O
gives O
him O
such O
pleasure O
. O
So O
I O
went O
to O
another O
doctor O
to O
try O
and O
get O
him O
to O
say O
something O
different O
, O
and O
he O
said O
, O
' O
Oh O
, O
it O
was O
only O
weakness O
, O
' O
and O
gived O
me O
a O
bottle O
of O
lotion O

I've O
used O
three S-CARDINAL
bottles O

each O
of O

em O
cost O
two B-MONEY
shillings E-MONEY

and O
my O
eye O
is O
so O
much O
worse O
, O
not O
hurting O
so O
much O
, O
but O
I O
can't O
see O
a O
bit O
with O
it O

There O
now O

Mary S-PERSON

" O
continued O
she O
, O
shutting O
one S-CARDINAL
eye O
, O
" O
now O
you O
only O
look O

" O
Yes O
, O
pretty O
near O
as O
well O

Th' O
only O
difference O
is O
, O
that O
if O
I O
sew O
a O
long O

together O

a O
bright O
spot O

I'm O
looking O

the O
rest O
is O
quite O

just O

I O

I've O
been O
to O
both O

now O
they're O
both O
o' O
the O

Plain O
work O
pays O
so O
bad O
, O
and O
mourning O
has O
been O
so O
plentiful O
this O
winter O

were O
tempted O

take O
in O
any O
black O
work O

could O

a O
very O
narrow O

not O
twenty B-QUANTITY

miserably O
lighted O

paved O

Right O
against O
this O
end O
of O
the O

were O
the O
gable O
ends O
of O
the O
last O
house O
in O
the O
principal O
street O
— O
a O
house O
which O
from O
its O
size O
, O
its O
handsome O
stone O
facings O
, O
and O
the O
attempt O
at O
ornament O
in O
the O
front O
, O
had O
probably O
been O
once O
a O
gentleman's O
house O

but O
now O
the O
light O
which O
streamed O
from O
its O
enlarged O
front O
windows O
made O
clear O
the O
interior O
of O
the O
splendidly O
fitted O
up O
room O
, O
with O
its O
painted O
walls O

pillared O
recesses O

its O
gilded O

gorgeous O
fittings O
up O
, O
its O
miserable O
, O
squalid O
inmates O
. O
It O
was O
a O
gin O
palace O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
almost O
wished O
herself O
away O
, O
so O
fearful O
( O
as O
Margaret S-PERSON
had O
said O
) O
was O
the O
sight O
when O
they O
joined O
the O
crowd O
assembled O
to O
witness O
the O
fire O
. O
There O
was O
a O
murmur O
of O
many O
voices O
whenever O
the O
roaring O
of O
the O
flames O
ceased O
for O
an O
instant O
. O
It O
was O
easy O
to O
perceive O
the O
mass O
were O
deeply O
interested O
. O
" O
What O
do O
they O
say O
? O
" O
asked O
Margaret S-PERSON
, O
of O
a O
neighbour O
in O
the O
crowd O
, O
as O
she O
caught O
a O
few O
words O
, O
clear O
and O
distinct O
, O
from O
the O
general O
murmur O
. O
" O
There O
never O
is O
anyone O
in O
the O
mill O
, O
surely O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
as O
the O
sea O
of O
upward O
- O
turned O
faces O
moved O
with O
one S-CARDINAL
accord O
to O
the O
eastern O
end O
, O
looking O
into O
Dunham B-FAC
Street E-FAC
, O
the O
narrow O
back O
lane O
already O
mentioned O
. O
The O
western O
end O
of O
the O
mill O
, O
whither O
the O
raging O
flames O
were O
driven O
by O
the O
wind O
, O
was O
crowned O
and O
turreted O
with O
triumphant O
fire O
. O
It O
sent O
forth O
its O
infernal O
tongues O
from O
every O
window O
hole O
, O
licking O
the O
black O
walls O
with O
amorous O
fierceness O
| | O
it O
was O
swayed O
or O
fell O
before O
the O
mighty O
gale O
, O
only O
to O
rise O
higher O
and O
yet O
higher O
, O
to O
ravage O
and O
roar O
yet O
more O
wildly O
. O
This O
part O
of O
the O
roof O
fell O
in O
with O
an O
astounding O
crash O
, O
while O
the O
crowd O
struggled O
more O
and O
more O
to O
press O
into O
Dunham B-FAC
Street E-FAC
, O
for O
what O
were O
magnificent O
terrible O
flames O
, O
what O
were O
falling O
timbers O
or O
tottering O
walls O
, O
in O
comparison O
with O
human O
life O
? O
There O
, O
where O
the O
devouring O
flames O
had O
been O
repelled O
by O
the O
yet O
more O
powerful O
wind O
, O
but O
where O
yet O
black O
smoke O
gushed O
out O
from O
every O
aperture O
, O
there O
, O
at O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
windows O
on O
the O
fourth S-ORDINAL
story O
, O
or O
rather O
a O
doorway O
where O
a O
crane O
was O
fixed O
to O
hoist O
up O
goods O
, O
might O
occasionally O
be O
seen O
, O
when O
the O
thick O
gusts O
of O
smoke O
cleared O
partially O
away O
for O
an O
instant O
, O
the O
imploring O
figures O
of O
two S-CARDINAL
men O
. O
They O
had O
remained O
after O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
workmen O
for O
some O
reason O
or O
other O
, O
and O
, O
owing O
to O
the O
wind O
having O
driven O
the O
fire O
in O
the O
opposite O
direction O
, O
had O
perceived O
no O
sight O

alarm O

till O
long O
after O
( O
if O
any O

called O
long O
in O
that O
throng O

passed O
by O
in O
less B-TIME

) O
the O
fire O

consumed O
the O
old O
wooden O
staircase O
at O
the O
other O
end O
of O
the O
building O
. O
I O
am O
not O
sure O
whether O
it O
was O
not O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
sound O
of O
the O
rushing O
crowd O
below O
that O
made O
them O
fully O
aware O
of O
their O
awful O
position O

" O
Where O
are O
the O
engines O

" O
asked O
Margaret S-PERSON

ten B-TIME

audibly O

" O
Ay O

Wilson's S-PERSON

out O

with O
terror O

knew O

at O
first O
she O

latter O
was O
fixed O
, O
by O
the O
position O
of O
the O
head O
, O
which O
never O
wavered O
| | O
the O
ladder O
shook O
under O
the O
double O
weight O
| | O
but O
still O
he O
never O
moved O
his O
head O
— O
he O
dared O
not O
look O
below O
. O
It O
seemed O
an O
age O
before O
the O
crossing O
was O
accomplished O
. O
At O
last O
the O
window O
was O
gained O
| | O
the O
bearer O
relieved O
from O
his O
burden O
| | O
both O
had O
disappeared O
. O
Then O
the O
multitude O
might O
shout O
| | O
and O
above O
the O
roaring O
flames O
, O
louder O
than O
the O
blowing O
of O
the O
mighty O
wind O
, O
arose O
that O
tremendous O
burst O
of O
applause O
at O
the O
success O
of O
the O
daring O
enterprise O
. O
Then O
a O
shrill O
cry O
was O
heard O
, O
asking O
" O
Is O
the O
oud O
man O
alive O
, O
and O
likely O
to O
do O
? O
" O
" O
Ay O
, O
" O
answered O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
firemen O
to O
the O
hushed O
crowd O
below O
. O
" O
He's O
coming O
round O
finely O
, O
now O
he's O
had O
a O
dash O
of O
cowd O
water O
. O
" O
He O
drew O
back O
his O
head O
| | O
and O
the O
eager O
inquiries O
, O
the O
shouts O
, O
the O
sea O
- O
like O
murmurs O
of O
the O
moving O
rolling O
mass O
began O
again O
to O
be O
heard O
— O
but O
for O
an O
instant O
though O
. O
In O
far O
less O
time O
than O
even O
that O
in O
which O
I O
have O
endeavoured O
briefly O
to O
describe O
the O
pause O
of O
events O
, O
the O
same O
bold O
hero O
stepped O
again O
upon O
the O
ladder O
, O
with O
evident O
purpose O
to O
rescue O
the O
man O
yet O
remaining O
in O
the O
burning O
mill O
. O
He O
went O
across O
in O
the O
same O
quick O
steady O
manner O
as O
before O
, O
and O
the O
people O
below O
, O
made O
less O
acutely O
anxious O
by O
his O
previous O
success O
, O
were O
talking O
to O
each O
other O
, O
shouting O
out O
intelligence O
of O
the O
progress O
of O
the O
fire O
at O
the O
other O
end O
of O
the O
factory O
, O
telling O
of O
the O
endeavours O
of O
the O
firemen O
at O
that O
part O
to O
obtain O
water O
, O
while O
the O
closely O
packed O
body O
of O
men O
heaved O
and O
rolled O
from O
side O
to O
side O
. O
It O
was O
different O
from O
the O
former O
silent O
breathless O
hush O
. O
I O
do O
not O
know O
if O
it O
were O
from O
this O
cause O
, O
or O
from O
the O
recollection O
of O
peril O
past O
, O
or O
that O
he O
looked O
below O
, O
in O
the O
breathing O
moment O
before O
returning O
with O
the O
remaining O
person O
( O
a O
slight O
little O
man O
) O
slung O
across O
his O
shoulders O
, O
but O
Jem B-PERSON
Wilson's E-PERSON
step O
was O
less O
steady O
, O
his O
tread O
more O
uncertain O
| | O
he O
seemed O
to O
feel O
with O
his O
foot O
for O
the O
next O
round O
of O
the O
ladder O
, O
to O
waver O
, O
and O
finally O
to O
stop O
half S-CARDINAL
- O
way O
. O
By O
this O
time O
the O
crowd O
was O
still O
enough O
| | O
in O
the O
awful O
instant O
that O
intervened O
no O
one O
durst O
speak O
, O
even O
to O
encourage O
. O
Many O
turned O
sick O
with O
terror O
, O
and O
shut O
their O
eyes O
to O
avoid O
seeing O
the O
catastrophe O
they O
dreaded O
. O
It O
came O
. O
The O
brave O
man O
swayed O
from O
side O
to O
side O
, O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
as O
slightly O
as O
if O
only O
balancing O
himself O
| | O
but O
he O
was O
evidently O
losing O
nerve O
, O
and O
even O
sense O
: O
it O
was O
only O
wonderful O
how O
the O
animal O
instinct O
of O
self O
- O
preservation O
did O
not O
overcome O
every O
generous O
feeling O
, O
and O
impel O
him O
at O
once O
to O
drop O
the O
helpless O
, O
inanimate O
body O
he O
carried O
| | O
perhaps O
the O
same O
instinct O
told O
him O
, O
that O
the O
sudden O
loss O
of O
so O
heavy O
a O
weight O
would O
of O
itself O
be O
a O
great O
and O
imminent O
danger O
. O
" O
Help O
me O
! O
she's O
fainted O
, O
" O
cried O
Margaret S-PERSON
. O
But O
no O
one O
heeded O
. O
All O
eyes O
were O
directed O
upwards O
. O
At O
this O
point O
of O
time O
a O
rope O
, O
with O
a O
running O
noose O
, O
was O
dexterously O
thrown O
by O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
firemen O
, O
after O
the O
manner O
of O
a O
lasso O
, O
over O
the O
head O
and O
round O
the O
bodies O
of O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
men O
. O
True O
, O
it O
was O
with O
rude O
and O
slight O
adjustment O
: O
but O
, O
slight O
as O
it O
was O
, O
it O
served O
as O
a O
steadying O
guide O
| | O
it O
encouraged O
the O
sinking O
heart O
, O
the O
dizzy O
head O
. O
Once O
more O
Jem S-PERSON
stepped O
onwards O
. O
He O
was O
not O
hurried O
by O
any O
jerk O
or O
pull O
. O
Slowly O
and O
gradually O
the O
rope O
was O
hauled O
in O
, O
slowly O
and O
gradually O
did O
he O
make O
the O
four S-CARDINAL
or O
five S-CARDINAL
paces O
between O
him O
and O
safety O
. O
The O
window O
was O
gained O
, O
and O
all O
were O
saved O
. O
The O
multitude O
in O
the O
street O
absolutely O
danced O
with O
triumph O
, O
and O
huzzaed O
and O
yelled O
till O
you O
would O
have O
fancied O
their O
very O
throats O
would O
crack O
| | O
and O
then O
with O
all O
the O
fickleness O
of O
interest O
characteristic O
of O
a O
large O
body O
of O
people O
, O
pressed O
and O
stumbled O
, O
and O
cursed O
and O
swore O
in O
the O
hurry O
to O
get O
out O
of O
Dunham B-FAC
Street E-FAC
, O
and O
back O
to O
the O
immediate O
scene O
of O
the O
fire O
, O
the O
mighty O
diapason O
of O
whose O
roaring O
flames O
formed O
an O
awful O
accompaniment O
to O
the O
screams O
, O
and O
yells O
, O
and O
imprecations O
, O
of O
the O
struggling O
crowd O
. O
As O
they O
pressed O
away O
, O
Margaret S-PERSON
was O
left O
, O
pale O
and O
almost O
sinking O
under O
the O
weight O
of O
Mary's S-PERSON
body O
, O
which O
she O
had O
preserved O
in O
an O
upright O
position O
by O
keeping O
her O
arms O
tight O
round O
Mary's O
waist O
, O
dreading O
, O
with O
reason O
, O
the O
trampling O
of O
unheeding O
feet O
. O
Now O
, O
however O
, O
she O
gently O
let O
her O
down O
on O
the O
cold O
clean O
pavement O
| | O
and O
the O
change O
of O
posture O
, O
and O
the O
difference O
in O
temperature O
, O
now O
that O
the O
people O
had O
withdrawn O
from O
their O
close O
neighbourhood O
, O
speedily O
restored O
her O
to O
consciousness O
. O
Her O
first S-ORDINAL
glance O
was O
bewildered O
and O
uncertain O
. O
She O
had O
forgotten O
where O
she O
was O
. O
Her O
cold O
, O
hard O
bed O
felt O
strange O
| | O
the O
murky O
glare O
in O
the O
sky O
affrighted O
her O
. O
She O
shut O
her O
eyes O
to O
think O
, O
to O
recollect O
. O
Her O
next O
look O
was O
upwards O
. O
The O
fearful O
bridge O
had O
been O
withdrawn O
| | O
the O
window O
was O
unoccupied O
. O
" O
They O
are O
safe O
, O
" O
said O
Margaret S-PERSON
. O
" O
All O
? O
Are O
all O
safe O
, O
Margaret S-PERSON
? O
" O
asked O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
" O
Ask O
yon O
fireman O
, O
and O
he'll O
tell O
you O
more O
about O
it O
than O
I O
can O
. O
But O
I O
know O
they're O
all O
safe O
. O
" O
The O
fireman O
hastily O
corroborated O
Margaret's S-PERSON
words O
. O
" O
Why O
did O
you O
let O
Jem B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
go O
twice O
? O
" O
asked O
Margaret S-PERSON
. O
" O
Let O
! O
— O
why O
we O
could O
not O
hinder O
him O
. O
As O
soon O
as O
ever O
he'd O
heard O
his O
father O
speak O
( O
which O
he O
was O
na O
long O
a O
doing O
) O
, O
Jem S-PERSON
were O
off O
like O
a O
shot O
| | O
only O
saying O
he O
knowed O
better O
nor O
us O
where O
to O
find O
t'other O
man O
. O
We'd O
all O
ha O
' O
gone O
, O
if O
he O
had O
na O
been O
in O
such O
a O
hurry O
, O
for O
no O
one O
can O
say O
as O
Manchester S-GPE
firemen O
is O
ever O
backward O
when O
there's O
danger O
. O
" O
So O
saying O
, O
he O
ran O
off O
| | O
and O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
girls O
, O
without O
remark O
or O
discussion O
, O
turned O
homewards O
. O
They O
were O
overtaken O
by O
the O
elder O
Wilson S-PERSON
, O
pale O
, O
grimy O
, O
and O
blear O
- O
eyed O
, O
but O
apparently O
as O
strong O
and O
well O
as O
ever O
. O
He O
loitered O
a O
minute O
or O
two S-CARDINAL
alongside O
of O
them O
, O
giving O
an O
account O
of O
his O
detention O
in O
the O
mill O
| | O
he O
then O
hastily O
wished O
good O
- O
night O
, O
saying O
he O
must O
go O
home O
and O
tell O
his O
missis O
he O
was O
all O
safe O
and O
well O
: O
but O
after O
he O
had O
gone O
a O
few O
steps O
, O
he O
turned O
back O
, O
came O
on O
Mary's O
side O
of O
the O
pavement O
, O
and O
in O
an O
earnest O
whisper O
, O
which O
Margaret S-PERSON
could O
not O
avoid O
hearing O
, O
he O
said O
, O
" O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
if O
my O
boy O
comes O
across O
you O
to O
- O
night O
, O
give O
him O
a O
kind O
word O
or O
two S-CARDINAL
for O
my O
sake O
. O
Do O
! O
bless O
you O
, O
there's O
a O
good O
wench O
. O
" O
Mary S-PERSON
hung O
her O
head O
and O
answered O
not O
a O
word O
, O
and O
in O
an O
instant O
he O
was O
gone O
. O
When O
they O
arrived O
at O
home O
, O
they O
found O
John B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
smoking O
his O
pipe O
, O
unwilling O
to O
question O
, O
yet O
very O
willing O
to O
hear O
all O
the O
details O
they O
could O
give O
him O
. O
Margaret S-PERSON
went O
over O
the O
whole O
story O
, O
and O
it O
was O
amusing O
to O
watch O
his O
gradually O
increasing O
interest O
and O
excitement O
. O
First S-ORDINAL
, O
the O
regular O
puffing O
abated O
, O
then O
ceased O
. O
Then O
the O
pipe O
was O
fairly O
taken O
out O
of O
his O
mouth O
, O
and O
held O
suspended O
. O
Then O
he O
rose O
, O
and O
at O
every O
further O
point O
he O
came O
a O
step O
nearer O
to O
the O
narrator O
. O
When O
it O
was O
ended O
, O
he O
swore O
( O
an O
unusual O
thing O
for O
him O
) O
that O
if O
Jem B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
wanted O
Mary S-PERSON
he O
should O
have O
her O
to O
- O
morrow O
, O
if O
he O
had O
not O
a O
penny O
to O
keep O
her O
. O
Margaret S-PERSON
laughed O
, O
but O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
now O
recovered O
from O
her O
agitation O
, O
pouted O
, O
and O
looked O
angry O
. O
The O
work O
which O
they O
had O
left O
was O
resumed O
: O
but O
with O
full O
hearts O
, O
fingers O
never O
go O
very O
quickly O
| | O
and O
I O
am O
sorry O
to O
say O
, O
that O
owing O
to O
the O
fire O
, O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
younger O
Miss O
Ogdens S-PERSON
were O
in O
such O
grief O
for O
the O
loss O
of O
their O
excellent O
father O
, O
that O
they O
were O
unable O
to O
appear O
before O

little O
circle O

sympathising O

and O
tore O
from O
him O
the O
food O
he O
had O
brought O
with O
him O
. O
It O
was O
a O
large O
hunch O
of O
bread O
, O
but O
it O
vanished O
in O
an O
instant O
. O
" O
We O

" O
So O
he O
strode O
, O
and O
ran O
, O

hurried O
home O

He O
emptied O
into O
the O

the O
little O
meal O
remaining O
in O

Mary S-PERSON

Miss O
Simmonds' S-PERSON

her O
food O
for O
the O
day O
was O

Then O
he O
went O
up O

for O
his O

He O
went O
to O
the O
pawn O

he O
pawned O
them O
for O
five B-MONEY

he O
stopped O
not O

within O
five S-CARDINAL

— O
then O
he O
loitered O
in O
his O
gait O
, O
in O
order O
to O
discover O
the O
shops O
he O
wanted O
. O
He O
bought O
meat O

a O
loaf O

bread O
, O
candles O
, O
chips O
, O
and O
from O
a O
little O
retail O
yard O
he O
purchased O
a O
couple O
of O
hundredweights O
of O
coals O

Some O
money O
yet O
remained O
— O
all O
destined O
for O
them O

but O
he O
did O
not O

it O

would O
wait O
. O
Wilson's S-PERSON
eyes O
filled O
with O
tears O
when O
he O
saw O
Barton S-PERSON
enter O
with O
his O
purchases O
. O
He O
understood O
it O
all O
, O
and O
longed O
to O
be O
once O
more O
in O
work O
, O
that O
he O
might O
help O
in O
some O
of O
these O
material O
ways O
, O
without O
feeling O
that O
he O

using O
his O
son's O
money O

But O
though O
" O
silver O

he O
had O
none O

" O
he O
gave O
heart O

more O
value O

Nor O
was O
John B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
behind O
in O
these O

" O
The O
fever O
" O
was O
( O
as O
it O
usually O
is O
in O
Manchester S-GPE
) O
of O
a O
low O
, O
putrid O
, O
typhoid O
kind O

brought O
on O
by O
miserable O
living O
, O
filthy O
neighbourhood O
, O
and O
great O
depression O
of O
mind O

body O
. O
It O
is O
virulent O
, O
malignant O
, O
and O
highly O
infectious O
. O
But O
the O
poor O
are O
fatalists O
with O
regard O
to O
infection O

and O
well O
for O
them O
it O
is O
so O
, O
for O
in O
their O
crowded O
dwellings O
no O
invalid O
can O
be O
isolated O
. O
Wilson S-PERSON
asked O
Barton S-PERSON
if O
he O
thought O
he O
should O
catch O
it O
, O
and O
was O
laughed O
at O
for O
his O
idea O
. O
The O
two S-CARDINAL
men O
, O
rough O
, O
tender O
nurses O
as O
they O
were O
, O
lighted O
the O
fire O
, O
which O
smoked O
and O
puffed O
into O
the O
room O
as O
if O
it O
did O
not O
know O
the O
way O
up O
the O
damp O
, O
unused O
chimney O
. O
The O
very O
smoke O
seemed O
purifying O
and O
healthy O
in O
the O
thick O
clammy O
air O
. O
The O
children O
clamoured O
again O
for O
bread O
| | O
but O
this O
time O
Barton S-PERSON
took O
a O
piece O
first S-ORDINAL
to O
the O
poor O
, O
helpless O
, O
hopeless O
woman O
, O
who O
still O
sat O
by O
the O
side O
of O
her O
husband O
, O
listening O
to O
his O
anxious O
miserable O
mutterings O
. O
She O
took O
the O
bread O
, O
when O
it O
was O
put O
into O
her O
hand O
, O
and O
broke O
a O
bit O
, O
but O
could O
not O
eat O
. O
She O
was O
past O
hunger O
. O
She O
fell O
down O
on O
the O
floor O
with O
a O
heavy O
unresisting O
bang O
. O
The O
men O
looked O
puzzled O
. O
" O
She's O
well O
- O
nigh O
clemmed O
, O
" O
said O
Barton S-PERSON
. O
" O
Folk O
do O
say O
one O
mustn't O
give O
clemmed O
people O
much O
to O
eat O

but O
, O
bless O
us O
, O
she'll O
eat O
nought O
. O
" O
" O
I'll O
tell O
yo O
what O
I'll O
do O
, O
" O
said O
Wilson S-PERSON
. O
" O
I'll O
take O
these O
two S-CARDINAL
big O
lads O
, O
as O
does O
nought O

fight O
, O
home O

my O
missis's O
for O
to O

night O
, O

I'll O
get O
a O
jug O
o' O
tea O

Them O
women O
always O
does O
best O
with O
tea O
and O
such O
- O
like O
slop O
. O
" O
So O
Barton S-PERSON
was O
now O
left O
alone O
with O
a O
little O
child O
, O
crying O
( O
when O
it O
had O
done O
eating O
) O
for O
mammy O
| | O
with O
a O
fainting O
, O
dead O
- O
like O
woman O
| | O
and O
with O
the O
sick O
man O
, O
whose O
mutterings O
were O
rising O
up O
to O
screams O
and O
shrieks O
of O
agonised O
anxiety O
. O
He O
carried O
the O
woman O
to O
the O
fire O
, O
and O
chafed O
her O
hands O
. O
He O
looked O
around O
for O
something O
to O
raise O
her O
head O
. O
There O
was O
literally O
nothing O
but O
some O
loose O
bricks O
. O
However O
, O
those O
he O
got O
| | O
and O
taking O
off O
his O
coat O
he O
covered O
them O
with O
it O
as O
well O
as O
he O
could O
. O
He O
pulled O
her O
feet O
to O
the O
fire O
, O
which O
now O
began O
to O
emit O
some O
faint O
heat O
. O
He O
looked O
round O
for O
water O
, O
but O
the O
poor O
woman O
had O
been O
too O
weak O
to O
drag O
herself O
out O
to O
the O
distant O
pump O
, O
and O
water O
there O
was O
none O
. O
He O
snatched O
the O
child O
, O
and O
ran O
up O
the O
area O
- O
steps O
to O
the O
room O
above O
, O
and O
borrowed O
their O
only O
saucepan O
with O
some O
water O
in O
it O
. O
Then O
he O
began O
, O
with O
the O
useful O
skill O
of O
a O
working O
- O
man O
, O
to O
make O
some O
gruel O
| | O
and O
when O
it O
was O
hastily O
made O
he O
seized O
a O
battered O
iron O
table O
- O
spoon O
( O
kept O
when O
many O
other O
little O
things O
had O
been O
sold O
in O
a O
lot O
) O
, O
in O
order O
to O
feed O
baby O
, O
and O
with O
it O
he O
forced O
one S-CARDINAL
or O
two S-CARDINAL
drops O
between O
her O
clenched O
teeth O
. O
The O
mouth O
opened O
mechanically O
to O
receive O
more O
, O
and O
gradually O
she O
revived O
. O
She O
sat O
up O
and O
looked O
round O
| | O
and O
recollecting O
all O
, O
fell O
down O
again O
in O
weak O
and O
passive O
despair O
. O
Her O
little O
child O
crawled O
to O
her O
, O
and O
wiped O
with O
its O
fingers O
the O
thick O
- O
coming O
tears O
which O
she O
now O
had O
strength O
to O
weep O
. O
It O
was O
now O
high O
time O
to O
attend O
to O
the O
man O
. O
He O
lay O
on O
straw O
, O
so O
damp O
and O
mouldy O
no O
dog O
would O
have O
chosen O
it O
in O
preference O
to O
flags O
| | O
over O
it O
was O
a O
piece O
of O
sacking O
, O
coming O
next O
to O
his O
worn O
skeleton O
of O
a O
body O
| | O
above O
him O
was O
mustered O
every O
article O
of O
clothing O
that O
could O
be O
spared O
by O
mother O
or O
children O
this O
bitter O
weather O
| | O
and O
in O
addition O
to O
his O
own O
, O
these O
might O
have O
given O
as O
much O
warmth O
as O
one S-CARDINAL
blanket O
, O
could O
they O
have O
been O
kept O
on O
him O
| | O
but O
as O
he O
restlessly O
tossed O
to O
and O
fro O
, O
they O
fell O
off O
and O
left O
him O
shivering O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
burning O
heat O
of O
his O
skin O
. O
Every O
now O
and O
then O
he O
started O
up O
in O
his O
naked O
madness O
, O
looking O
like O
the O
prophet O
of O
woe O
in O
the O
fearful O
plague O
- O
picture O
| | O
but O
he O
soon O
fell O
again O
in O
exhaustion O
, O
and O
Barton S-PERSON
found O
he O
must O
be O
closely O
watched O
, O
lest O
in O
these O
falls O
he O
should O
injure O
himself O
against O
the O
hard O
brick O
floor O
. O
He O
was O
thankful O
when O
Wilson S-PERSON
re-appeared O
, O
carrying O
in O
both O
hands O
a O
jug O
of O
steaming O
tea O
, O
intended O
for O
the O
poor O
wife O
| | O
but O
when O
the O
delirious O
husband O
saw O
drink O
, O
he O
snatched O
at O
it O
with O
animal O
instinct O
, O
with O
a O
selfishness O
he O
had O
never O
shown O
in O
health O
. O
Then O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
men O
consulted O
together O
. O
It O
seemed O
decided O
, O
without O
a O
word O
being O
spoken O
on O
the O
subject O
, O
that O
both O
should O
spend O
the O
night O
with O
the O
forlorn O
couple O
| | O
that O
was O
settled O
. O
But O
could O
no O
doctor O
be O
had O
? O
In O
all O
probability O
, O
no O
| | O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
day E-DATE
an O
infirmary O
order O
might O
be O
begged O
, O
but O
meanwhile O
the O
only O
medical O
advice O
they O
could O
have O
must O
be O
from O
a O
druggist's O
. O
So O
Barton S-PERSON
( O
being O
the O
moneyed O
man O
) O
set O
out O
to O
find O
a O
shop O
in O
London B-FAC
Road E-FAC
. O
It O
is O
a O
pretty O
sight O
to O
walk O
through O
a O
street O
with O
lighted O
shops O
| | O
the O
gas O
is O
so O
brilliant O
, O
the O
display O
of O
goods O
so O
much O
more O
vividly O
shown O
than O
by O
day O
, O
and O
of O
all O
shops O
a O
druggist's O
looks O
the O
most O
like O
the O
tales O
of O
our O
childhood O
, O
from O
Aladdin's O
garden O
of O
enchanted O
fruits O
to O
the O
charming O
Rosamond S-PERSON
with O
her O
purple O
jar O
. O
No O
such O
associations O
had O
Barton S-PERSON
| | O
yet O
he O
felt O
the O
contrast O
between O
the O
well O
- O
filled O
, O
well O
- O
lighted O
shops O
and O
the O
dim O
gloomy O
cellar O
, O
and O
it O
made O
him O
moody O
that O
such O
contrasts O
should O
exist O
. O
They O
are O
the O
mysterious O
problem O
of O
life O
to O
more O
than O
him O
. O
He O
wondered O
if O
any O
in O
all O
the O
hurrying O
crowd O
had O
come O
from O
such O
a O
house O
of O
mourning O
. O
He O
thought O
they O
all O
looked O
joyous O
, O
and O
he O
was O
angry O
with O
them O
. O
But O
he O
could O
not O
, O
you O
cannot O
, O
read O
the O
lot O
of O
those O
who O
daily O
pass O
you O
by O
in O
the O
street O
. O
How O
do O
you O
know O
the O
wild O
romances O
of O
their O
lives O
| | O
the O
trials O
, O
the O
temptations O
they O
are O
even O
now O
enduring O
, O
resisting O
, O
sinking O
under O
? O
You O
may O
be O
elbowed O
one S-CARDINAL
instant O
by O
the O
girl O
desperate O
in O
her O
abandonment O
, O
laughing O
in O
mad O
merriment O
with O
her O
outward O
gesture O
, O
while O
her O
soul O
is O
longing O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
dead O
, O
and O
bringing O
itself O
to O
think O
of O
the O
cold O
- O
flowing O
river O
as O
the O
only O
mercy O
of O
God O
remaining O
to O
her O
here O
. O
You O
may O
pass O
the O
criminal O
, O
meditating O
crimes O
at O
which O
you O
will O
to O
- O
morrow O
shudder O
with O
horror O
as O
you O
read O
them O
. O
You O
may O
push O
against O
one O
, O
humble O
and O
unnoticed O
, O
the O
last O
upon O
earth O
, O
who O
in O
Heaven O
will O
for O
ever O
be O
in O

could O
judge O
, O
Davenport S-PERSON
continued O
in O
the O
same O
state O
, O
although O
the O
symptoms O
varied O
occasionally O
. O
The O
wife O
slept O
on O
, O
only O
roused O
by O
a O
cry O
of O
her O
child O
now O
and O
then O
, O
which O
seemed O
to O
have O
power O
over O
her O
, O
when O
far O
louder O
noises O
failed O
to O
disturb O
her O
. O
The O
watchers O
agreed O
, O
that O
as O
soon O
as O
it O
was O
likely O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
would O
be O
up O
and O
visible O
, O
Wilson S-PERSON
should O
go O
to O
his O
house O
, O
and O
beg O
for O
an O
Infirmary O
order O
. O
At O
length O
the O
gray O
dawn O
penetrated O
even O
into O
the O
dark O
cellar O
. O
Davenport S-PERSON
slept O
, O
and O
Barton S-PERSON
was O
to O
remain O
there O
until O
Wilson's S-PERSON
return O
| | O
so O
stepping O
out O
into O
the O
fresh O
air O
, O
brisk O
and O
reviving O
, O
even O
in O
that O
street O
of O
abominations O
, O
Wilson S-PERSON
took O
his O
way O
to O
Mr. O
Carson's S-PERSON
. O
Wilson S-PERSON
had O
about B-QUANTITY
two I-QUANTITY
miles E-QUANTITY
to O
walk O
before O
he O
reached O
Mr. O
Carson's S-PERSON
house O
, O
which O
was O
almost O
in O
the O
country O
. O
The O
streets O
were O
not O
yet O
bustling O
and O
busy O
. O
The O
shopmen O
were O
lazily O
taking O
down O
the O
shutters O
, O
although O
it O
was O
near O
eight B-TIME
o'clock E-TIME
| | O
for O
the O
day O
was O
long O
enough O
for O
the O
purchases O
people O
made O
in O
that O
quarter O
of O
the O
town O
, O
while O
trade O
was O
so O
flat O
. O
One S-CARDINAL
or O
two S-CARDINAL
miserable O
- O
looking O
women O
were O
setting O
off O
on O
their O
day's O
begging O
expedition O
. O
But O
there O
were O
few O
people O
abroad O
. O
Mr. O
Carson's S-PERSON
was O
a O
good O
house O
, O
and O
furnished O
with O
disregard O
to O
expense O
. O
But O
in O
addition O
to O
lavish O
expenditure O
, O
there O
was O
much O
taste O
shown O
, O
and O
many O
articles O
chosen O
for O
their O
beauty O
and O
elegance O
adorned O
his O
rooms O
. O
As O
Wilson S-PERSON
passed O
a O
window O
which O
a O
housemaid O
had O
thrown O
open O
, O
he O
saw O
pictures O
and O
gilding O
, O
at O
which O
he O
was O
tempted O
to O
stop O
and O
look O
| | O
but O
then O
he O
thought O
it O
would O
not O
be O
respectful O
. O
So O
he O
hastened O
on O
to O
the O
kitchen O
door O
. O
The O
servants O
seemed O
very O
busy O
with O
preparations O
for O
breakfast O
| | O
but O
good O
- O
naturedly O
, O
though O
hastily O
, O
told O
him O
to O
step O
in O
, O
and O
they O
could O
soon O
let O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
know O
he O
was O
there O
. O
So O
he O
was O
ushered O
into O
a O
kitchen O
hung O
round O
with O
glittering O
tins O
, O
where O
a O
roaring O
fire O
burnt O
merrily O
, O
and O
where O
numbers O
of O
utensils O
hung O
round O
, O
at O
whose O
nature O
and O
use O
Wilson S-PERSON
amused O
himself O
by O
guessing O
. O
Meanwhile O
, O
the O
servants O
bustled O
to O
and O
fro O
| | O
an O
out O
- O
door O
man-servant O
came O
in O
for O
orders O
, O
and O
sat O
down O
near O
Wilson S-PERSON
| | O
the O
cook O
broiled O
steaks O
, O
and O
the O
kitchen O
- O
maid O
toasted O
bread O
, O
and O
boiled O
eggs O
. O
The O
coffee O
steamed O
upon O
the O
fire O
, O
and O
altogether O
the O
odours O
were O
so O
mixed O
and O
appetising O
, O
that O
Wilson S-PERSON
began O
to O
yearn O
for O
food O
to O
break O
his O
fast O
, O
which O
had O
lasted O
since O
dinner O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
before E-DATE
. O
If O
the O
servants O
had O
known O
this O
, O
they O
would O
have O
willingly O
given O
him O
meat O
and O
bread O
in O
abundance O
| | O
but O
they O
were O
like O
the O
rest O
of O
us O
, O
and O
not O
feeling O
hunger O
themselves O
, O
forgot O
it O
was O
possible O
another O
might O
. O
So O
Wilson's S-PERSON
craving O
turned O
to O
sickness O
, O
while O
they O
chattered O
on O
, O
making O
the O
kitchen's O
free O
and O
keen O
remarks O
upon O
the O
parlour O
. O
" O
How O

night O
, O

" O
" O

there O

called O

you O

asked O
the O
housemaid O

who O
had O
done O
her O
work O
for O
the O
present O

self O

It O

long O

they O
had O
all O
spoken O
kindly O

him O

who O
could O
tell O
if O

do O
something O

the O

time O

after O
breakfast O

noticed O
his O
paleness O

had O
had O
meat O

bread O
ready O

came O
out O

full O
stomach O

more O

When O
he O
reached O
Berry B-FAC
Street E-FAC

he O
had O
persuaded O
himself O

bore O
good O
news O

felt O
almost O
elated O
in O
his O
heart O

But O
it O
fell O
when O
he O
opened O
the O
cellar O

door O

and O
saw O
Barton S-PERSON

bending O
over O

sick O
man's O
couch O

struck O

saddened O
look O

" O
There's O

Wilson S-PERSON
looked O

The O
flesh O
was O
sunk O
, O
the O
features O
prominent O

bony O

and O
rigid O
. O
The O
fearful O
clay O
- O
colour O
of O
death O
was O
over O
all O
. O
But O
the O
eyes O
were O
open O
and O
sensible O
, O
though O
the O
films O
of O
the O
grave O
were O
settling O
upon O
them O

" O
He O
wakened O

his O
sleep O

yo O
left O
him O
in O

began O
to O
mutter O

moan O

he O
soon O
went O
off O
again O
, O

we O
never O
knew O

were O
awake O
till O
he O
called O
his O
wife O

now O

gotten O
nought O

probably O

as O
they O
all O
felt O
, O
he O
could O
not O
speak O

for O
his O
strength O

fast O
ebbing O

They O
stood O
round O
him O
still O

silent O

even O
the O
wife O
checked O
her O
sobs O
, O
though O
her O
heart O
was O
like O
to O
break O
. O
She O
held O
her O
child O
to O
her O
breast O
, O
to O
try O

keep O
him O
quiet O

Their O
eyes O
were O
all O
fixed O
on O
the O
yet O
living O
one O
, O
whose O
moments O
of O
life O
were O
passing O
so O
rapidly O
away O

At O
length O
he O
brought O
( O
with O
jerking O
, O
convulsive O
effort O
) O
his O
two S-CARDINAL
hands O
into O
the O
attitude O
of O
prayer O
. O
They O
saw O
his O
lips O
move O
, O
and O
bent O
to O
catch O
the O
words O
, O
which O
came O
in O
gasps O

not O

not O

he O
moved O
his O

telling O

in O
a O
little O

fell O
to O

sum O
of O
money O
now O
. O
Would O
Mrs. O
Davenport S-PERSON
and O
the O
little O
child O
go O
home O
with O
Mary S-PERSON
? O
The O
latter O
brightened O
up O
as O
she O
urged O
this O
plan O
| | O
but O
no O
! O
where O
the O
poor O
, O
fondly O
loved O
remains O
were O
, O
there O
would O
the O
mourner O
be O
| | O
and O
all O
that O
they O
could O
do O
was O
to O
make O
her O
as O
comfortable O
as O
their O
funds O
would O
allow O
, O
and O
to O
beg O
a O
neighbour O
to O
look O
in O
and O
say O
a O
word O
at O
times O
. O
So O
she O
was O
left O
alone O
with O
her O
dead O
, O
and O
they O
went O
to O
work O
that O
had O
work O
, O
and O
he O
who O
had O
none O
, O
took O
upon O
him O
the O
arrangements O
for O
the O
funeral O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
had O
many O
a O
scolding O
from O
Miss O
Simmonds S-PERSON
that O
day O
for O
her O
absence O
of O
mind O
. O
To O
be O
sure O
Miss O
Simmonds S-PERSON
was O
much O
put O
out O
by O
Mary's S-PERSON
non-appearance O
in O
the O
morning O
with O
certain O
bits O
of O
muslin O
, O
and O
shades O
of O
silk O
which O
were O
wanted O
to O
complete O
a O
dress O
to O
be O
worn O
that O
night O
| | O
but O
it O
was O
true O
enough O
that O
Mary S-PERSON
did O
not O
mind O
what O
she O
was O
about O
| | O
she O
was O
too O
busy O
planning O
how O
her O
old O
black O
gown O
( O
her O
best O
when O
her O
mother O
died O
) O
might O
be O
spunged O
, O
and O
turned O
, O
and O
lengthened O
into O
something O
like O
decent O
mourning O
for O
the O
widow O
. O
And O
when O
she O
went O
home O
at O
night O
( O
though O
it O
was O
very O
late O
, O
as O
a O
sort O
of O
retribution O
for O
her O
morning's O
negligence O
) O
, O
she O
set O
to O
work O
at O
once O
, O
and O
was O
so O
busy O
, O
and O
so O
glad O
over O
her O
task O
, O
that O
she O
had O
, O
every O
now O
and O
then O
, O
to O
check O
herself O
in O
singing O
merry O
ditties O
, O
that O
she O
felt O
little O
accorded O
with O
the O
sewing O
on O
which O
she O
was O
engaged O
. O
So O
when O
the O
funeral O
day O
came O
, O
Mrs. O
Davenport S-PERSON
was O
neatly O
arrayed O
in O
black O
, O
a O
satisfaction O
to O
her O
poor O
heart O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
her O
sorrow O
. O
Barton S-PERSON
and O
Wilson S-PERSON
both O
accompanied O
her O
, O
as O
she O
led O
her O
two S-CARDINAL
elder O
boys O
, O
and O
followed O
the O
coffin O
. O
It O
was O
a O
simple O
walking O
funeral O
, O
with O
nothing O

grate O

the O
feelings O
of O

more O

its O

than O
the O
gorgeous O
hearses O

and O
nodding O
plumes O
, O
which O
form O
the O
grotesque O
funeral O
pomp O
of O
respectable O
people O

was O

When O

they O
halted O

" O
How O
infinite O
the O

Garnered O

And O
oh O
! O
what O
bankrupts O
in O

When O
Death O

like O
some O
remorseless O
creditor O

Seizes O

all O

" O
" O
The O
Twins O

" O
The O
ghoul O
- O
like O
fever O
was O
not O
to O
be O
braved O
with O
impunity O
, O
and O
baulked O
of O
its O
prey O
. O
The O
widow O
had O
reclaimed O
her O
children O

her O
neighbours O
, O
in O
the O
good O
Samaritan S-NORP
sense O
of O
the O
word O
, O
had O
paid O
her O
little O
arrears O
of O
rent O
, O
and O
made O
her O
a B-MONEY
few I-MONEY
shillings E-MONEY
beforehand O
with O
the O
world O
. O
She O
determined O
to O
flit O
from O
that O
cellar O
to O
another O
less O
full O
of O
painful O
associations O
, O
less O
haunted O
by O
mournful O
memories O
. O
The O
board O
, O
not O
so O
formidable O
as O
she O
had O
imagined O
, O
had O
inquired O
into O
her O
case O

and O
, O
instead O
of O
sending O
her O
to O
Stoke B-PERSON
Claypole E-PERSON
, O
her O
husband's O
Buckinghamshire S-GPE
parish O
, O
as O
she O
had O
dreaded O
, O
had O
agreed O
to O
pay O
her O
rent O
. O
So O
food O
for O
four S-CARDINAL
mouths O
was O
all O
she O
was O
now O
required O
to O
find O

only O
for O
three S-CARDINAL

would O
have O
said O

for O
herself O
and O
the O
unweaned O
child O
were O
but O
reckoned O
as O
one O
in O
her O
calculation O
. O
She O
had O
a O
strong O
heart O
, O
now O
her O
bodily O
strength O
had O
been O
recruited O
by O
a B-DATE
week E-DATE
or O
two S-CARDINAL
of O
food O
, O
and O
she O
would O
not O
despair O
. O
So O
she O
took O
in O
some O
little O
children O
to O
nurse O
, O
who O
brought O
their O
daily O
food O
with O
them O
, O
which O
she O
cooked O
for O
them O
, O
without O
wronging O
their O
helplessness O
of O
a O
crumb O

and O
when O
she O
had O
restored O
them O
to O
their O
mothers O
at O
night O

she O
set O

plain O
sewing O

" O
seam O

and O
gusset O
, O

band O

sat O
thinking O
how O
she O
might O
best O
cheat O
the O
factory O
inspector O

persuade O
him O
that O
her O
strong O

Ben S-PERSON
was O
above O
thirteen O

Her O
plan O
of O

was O
so O
far O
arranged O

when O
she O
heard O
, O
with O
keen O
sorrow O
, O
that O
Wilson's O
twin O
lads O
were O
ill O
of O
the O
fever O

They O
had O
never O
been O
strong O

They O
were O
like O
many O
a O
pair O
of O
twins O
, O
and O
seemed O
to O
have O
but O
one S-CARDINAL
life O
divided O
between O
them O
. O
One S-CARDINAL
life O
, O
one S-CARDINAL
strength O
, O
and O
in O
this O
instance O
, O
I O
might O
almost O
say O
, O
one S-CARDINAL
brain O

for O
they O
were O
helpless O

gentle O

silly O
children O

but O
not O
the O
less O
dear O
to O
their O
parents O
and O
to O
their O
strong O
, O
active O
, O
manly O
, O
elder O
brother O
. O
They O
were O
late O
on O
their O
feet O
, O
late O
in O
talking O
, O
late O
every O
way O
| | O
had O
to O
be O
nursed O
and O
cared O
for O
when O
other O
lads O
of O
their O
age O
were O
tumbling O
about O
in O
the O
street O

losing O
themselves O

being O
taken O
to O
the O
police O

office O
miles O
away O

Still O

never O

make O
love O

these O
innocents O

out O
at O
the O
window O

Nor O
was O
this O
the O
case O

now O

when O
Jem B-PERSON
Wilson's E-PERSON
earnings O
, O
and O
his O
mother's O
occasional O
charrings O
were O
barely O
sufficient O

give O
all O
the O

when O

after O
ailing O
many B-DATE
days E-DATE
, O
and O
caring O
little O
for O
their O
meat O

fell O
sick O
on O
the B-TIME
same I-TIME
afternoon E-TIME
, O
with O
the O
same O
heavy O
stupor O
of O
suffering O
, O
the O
three S-CARDINAL
hearts O
that O
loved O
them O
so O

each O
felt O

little O
chance O

It O
was O
nearly B-DATE
a I-DATE
week E-DATE
before O
the O
tale O
of O
their O
illness O
spread O
as O
far O

the O
court O

the O
Wilsons S-PERSON

once O
dwelt O

the O
Bartons S-PERSON

her O
little O

several B-DATE

gone O
off O

her O
brother's O
house O

in O
Ancoats S-GPE

she O
was O
often O

to O
help O
in O
some O
sudden O
emergency O

illness O

distress O

so O
that O
occasioned O

Margaret S-PERSON

heard O
from O
him O
the O
state O
of O
things O
at O
his O
home O

She O
told O
Mary S-PERSON
of O
it O
as O
she O
entered O
the O
court O
late B-TIME
that I-TIME
evening E-TIME

and O
Mary S-PERSON
listened O
with O
saddened O
heart O
to O
the O
strange O
contrast O
which O
such O
woeful O
tidings O
presented O
to O
the O
gay O

loving O
words O
she O
had O
been O
hearing O
on O
her O
walk O
home O

She O
blamed O
herself O

being O

much O
taken O
up O

visions O

the O
golden O

off O

was O
so O

worse O
than O

At O

ventured O
to O
whisper O

" O

Alice S-PERSON
shook O
her O
head O
, O
and O
told O
with O
a O
look O
that O
she O
believed O
there O
was O
none O

She O
next O
endeavoured O
to O
lift O
the O
little O
body O
, O
and O
carry O
it O
to O
its O
old O
accustomed O
bed O

as O

he O
had O

all O
that O
concerned O

sprang O
gently O
up O

took O
his O
dead O

his O
hard O
couch O

him O
upstairs O

The O

louder O

with O
more O
of O

So O
many O
a O

lie O

that O

good O

go O
home O
at O

did O
I O
think O

God O
Almighty O
would O
baulk O
me O
, O
for O
not O
leaving O
my O
days O

Here's B-PERSON
George E-PERSON
out O
o' O
work O

more O
cast O
down O
than O
ever O
I O
seed O
him O

wanting O
every O
chip O
o' O
comfort O
he O
can O
get O
, O
e'en O
afore O
this O
last O
heavy O
stroke O

and O
now O
I'm O
thinking O
the O
Lord's O
finger O
points O
very O
clear O
to O
my O
fit O
abiding O
place O

and O
I'm O
sure O
if O
George S-PERSON
and O
Jane S-PERSON
can O
say O
' O
His O
will O
be O
done O

no O
more O
than O
what O

she O
fell O
to O
tidying O
the O

low O
moans O

were O
occasionally O
heard O
in O
the O
room O
below O

Mary S-PERSON
helped O
her O
in O
all O
these O
little O
offices O
. O
They O
were O
busy O
in O
this O
way O
when O
the O
door O
was O
softly O
opened O
, O
and O
Jem S-PERSON
came O
in O
, O
all O
grimed O

dirty O
from O
his O
night O
- O
work O
, O
his O
soiled O
apron O
wrapped O
round O
his O
middle O
, O
in O
guise O
and O
apparel O
in O
which O

would O
have O
been O
sorry O

another O
time O

have O
been O
seen O
by O

But O
just O
now O
he O
hardly O
saw O
her O

he O
went O
straight O
up O
to O
Alice S-PERSON
, O
and O
asked O
how O
the O
little O
chaps O
were O
. O
They O
had O
been O
a O
shade O
better O
at O
dinner O

had O
been O
working O
away O
through O
the O
long O
afternoon O
, O
and O
far O
into O
the O
night O
, O
in O
the O
belief O
that O
they O
had O
taken O
the O
turn O
. O
He O
had O
stolen O
out O
during O
the B-TIME
half I-TIME

hour E-TIME
allowed O
at O
the O
works O

buy O

or O
two S-CARDINAL

now O
puffed O
out O
his O
jacket O

pocket O

He O
would O
make O

aunt O
speak O

would O
not O
understand O

shakes O
of O

head O

fast O
coursing O
tears O

easy O
as O

Jem S-PERSON
went O
to O
the O
cupboard O
, O
and O
quietly O
extricated O
from O
his O
pocket O
the O
oranges O
he O
had O
bought O
. O
But O
he O
stayed O
long O
there O
, O
and O
at O
last O
his O
sturdy O
frame O
shook O
with O
his O
strong O
agony O
. O
The O
two S-CARDINAL
women O
were O
frightened O
, O
as O
women O
always O
are O
, O
on O
witnessing O
a O
man's O
overpowering O
grief O
. O
They O
cried O
afresh O
in O
company O
. O
Mary's S-PERSON
heart O
melted O
within O
her O
as O
she O
witnessed O
Jem's S-PERSON
sorrow O
, O
and O
she O
stepped O
gently O
up O
to O
the O
corner O
where O
he O
stood O
, O
with O
his O
back O
turned O
to O
them O
, O
and O
putting O
her O
hand O
softly O
on O
his O
arm O
, O
said O
, O
" O

" O
Jem S-PERSON
felt O
a O
strange O
leap O
of O
joy O
in O
his O
heart O
, O
and O
knew O
the O
power O
she O
had O
of O
comforting O
him O
. O
He O
did O
not O
speak O
, O
as O
though O
fearing O
to O
destroy O
by O
sound O
or O
motion O
the O
happiness O
of O
that O
moment O
, O
when O
her O
soft O
hand's O
touch O
thrilled O
through O
his O
frame O
, O
and O
her O
silvery O
voice O
was O
whispering O
tenderness O
in O
his O
ear O
. O
Yes O
! O
it O
might O
be O
very O
wrong O

could O
almost O
hate O
himself O

it O

with O
death O

woe O

surrounding O
him O

was O

whispered O
she O
again O
, O
believing O
that O
his O
silence O
was O
only O
another O
form O
of O
grief O
. O
He O
could O
not O
contain O
himself O
. O
He O
took O
her O
hand O
in O
his O
firm O
yet O
trembling O
grasp O
, O
and O
said O
, O
in O
tones O
that O
instantly O
produced O
a O
revulsion O
in O
her O
mood O
, O

children O

I O
cannot O

I O
must O
always O

will O
he O
thank O
me O
for O
it O

He's O
rather O
savage O
at O
times O

that O
I O
can O
see O

perhaps O
kindness O

So O
she O
turned O
on O
her O
pillow O

fell O
asleep O

dreamt O
of O
what O
was O
often O
in O
her O
waking O
thoughts O

of O
the O
day O
when O
she O

ride O

with O
wedding O

take O
up O

astonished O
father O

away O

the O
old O

day O
, O
— O

all O
day O
long O
if O
he O
liked O
. O
Such O
thoughts O
mingled O
in O
her O
predilection O
for O
the O
handsome O
young O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
, O
who O
, O
unfettered O
by O
work O
- O
hours O
, O
let O
scarcely O
a O
day O
pass O
without O
contriving O
a O
meeting O
with O
the O
beautiful O
little O
milliner O
he O
had O
first S-ORDINAL
seen O
while O
lounging O
in O
a O
shop O
where O
his O
sisters O
were O
making O
some O
purchases O
, O
and O
afterwards O
never O
rested O
till O
he O
had O
freely O
, O
though O
respectfully O
, O
made O
her O
acquaintance O
in O
her O
daily O
walks O
. O
He O
was O
, O
to O
use O
his O
own O
expression O
to O
himself O
, O
quite O
infatuated O
by O
her O
, O
and O
was O
restless O
each O
day O
till O
the O
time O
came O
when O
he O
had O
a O
chance O
, O
and O
, O
of O
late O
, O
more O
than O
a O
chance O
of O
meeting O
her O
. O
There O
was O
something O
of O
keen O
practical O
shrewdness O
about O
her O
, O
which O
contrasted O
very O
bewitchingly O
with O
the O
simple O
, O
foolish O
, O
unworldly O
ideas O
she O
had O
picked O
up O
from O
the O
romances O
which O
Miss O
Simmonds' S-PERSON
young O
ladies O
were O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
recommending O
to O
each O
other O
. O
Yes O
! O
Mary S-PERSON
was O
ambitious O
, O
and O
did O
not O
favour O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
the O
less O
because O
he O
was O
rich O
and O
a O
gentleman O

by O
her O

Esther S-PERSON

fermented O
in O
her O
little O
bosom O
, O
and O
perhaps O
all O
the O
more O
, O
for O
her O
father's O
aversion O
to O
the O
rich O
and O
the O
gentle O
. O
Such O
is O
the O
contrariness O
of O
the O
human O
heart O
, O
from O
Eve O
downwards O
, O
that O
we O
all O
, O
in O
our O
old O

Adam S-PERSON
state O
, O
fancy O
things O
forbidden O
sweetest O
. O
So O
Mary S-PERSON
dwelt O
upon O
and O
enjoyed O
the O
idea O
of O
some O
day O
becoming O
a O
lady O
, O
and O
doing O
all O
the O
elegant O
nothings O
appertaining O
to O
ladyhood O
. O
It O
was O
a O
comfort O
to O
her O
, O
when O
scolded O
by O
Miss O
Simmonds S-PERSON
, O
to O
think O
of O
the O
day O
when O
she O
would O
drive O
up O
to O
the O
door O
in O
her O
own O
carriage O
, O
to O
order O
her O
gowns O
from O
the O
hasty O
tempered O
yet O
kind O
dressmaker O
. O
It O
was O
a O
pleasure O
to O
her O
to O
hear O
the O
general O
admiration O
of O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
elder O
Miss O
Carsons S-PERSON

acknowledged O

on O

on O

of O
the O
time O
when O
she O
should O
ride O
and O
walk O
with O
them O

the O

of O
her O

the O

that O
which O
in O

, O
which O
lay O
open O
before O
her O
. O
So O
she O
watched O
all O
the O
greeting O
a O
friend O
gave O
Jem S-PERSON
| | O
she O
saw O
the O
face O
of O
condolence O
, O
the O
sympathetic O
shake O
of O
the O
hand O
, O
and O
had O
time O
to O
arrange O
her O
own O
face O
and O
manner O
before O
Jem S-PERSON
came O
in O
, O
which O
he O
did O
, O
as O
if O
he O
had O
eyes O
for O
no O
one O
but O
her O
father O
, O
who O
sat O
smoking O
his O
pipe O
by O
the O
fire O
, O
while O
he O
read O
an O
old O
" O
Northern O
Star O
, O
" O
borrowed O
from O
a O
neighbouring O
public O
- O
house O
. O
Then O
he O
turned O
to O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
who O
, O
he O
felt O
by O
the O
sure O
instinct O
of O
love O
, O
by O
which O
almost O
his O
body O
thought O
, O
was O
present O
. O
Her O
hands O
were O
busy O
adjusting O
her O
dress O
| | O
a O
forced O
and O
unnecessary O
movement O
Jem S-PERSON
could O
not O
help O
thinking O
. O
Her O
accost O
was O
quiet O
and O
friendly O
, O
if O
grave O
| | O
she O
felt O
that O
she O
reddened O
like O
a O
rose O
, O
and O
wished O
she O
could O
prevent O
it O
, O
while O
Jem S-PERSON
wondered O
if O
her O
blushes O
arose O
from O
fear O
, O
or O
anger O
, O
or O
love O
. O
She O
was O
very O
cunning O
, O
I O
am O
afraid O
. O
She O
pretended O
to O
read O
diligently O
, O
and O
not O
to O
listen O
to O
a O
word O
that O
was O
said O
, O
while O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
she O
heard O
all O
sounds O
, O
even O
to O
Jem's S-PERSON
long O
, O
deep O
sighs O
, O
which O
wrung O
her O
heart O
. O
At O
last O
she O
took O
up O
her O
Bible S-WORK_OF_ART
, O
and O
as O
if O
their O
conversation O
disturbed O
her O
, O
went O
up O
- O
stairs O
to O
her O
little O
room O
. O
And O
she O
had O
scarcely O
spoken O
a O
word O
to O
Jem S-PERSON
| | O
scarcely O
looked O
at O
him O
| | O
never O
noticed O
his O
beautiful O
sweet O
Nancy S-PERSON
, O
which O
only O
awaited O
her O
least O
word O
of O
praise O
to O
be O
hers O
! O
He O
did O
not O
know O
— O
that O
pang O
was O
spared O
— O
that O
in O
her O
little O
dingy O
bed O
- O
room O
, O
stood O
a O
white O
jug O
, O
filled O
with O
a O
luxuriant O
bunch O
of O
early O
spring O
roses O
, O
making O
the O
whole O
room O
fragrant O
and O
bright O
. O
They O
were O
the O
gift O
of O
her O
richer O
lover O
. O
So O
Jem S-PERSON
had O
to O
go O
on O
sitting O
with O
John B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
, O
fairly O
caught O
in O
his O
own O
trap O
, O
and O
had O
to O
listen O
to O
his O
talk O
, O
and O
answer O
him O
as O
best O
he O
might O
. O
" O
There's O

" O
At O

asked O
Jem S-PERSON
. O
" O
Ay O
, O
ay O
! O
else O
where's O
the O
use O

It's O
only O
taking O
out O

" O
" O
No O

said O
Jem S-PERSON
, O
listlessly O
. O
" O
Well O

yo O
must O

I O

[ O

So O
when O
I O
were O
better O
o' O
th' O
fever O
, O
but O
weak O
as O
water O
, O
they O
says O
to O
me O
, O
says O
they O
, O
' O
If O
yo O

yo O
may O
stay O

' O
So O
there O
wanted O
but O
one S-CARDINAL
word O
to O
that O
bargain O
. O
So O
I O
were O
set O
to O
writing O
and O
copying O
| | O
th' O
writing O
I O
could O
do O
well O
enough O
, O
but O
they'd O
such O
queer O
ways O
o' O
spelling O
that O
I'd O
ne'er O
been O
used O
to O
, O
that O
I'd O
to O
look O
first S-ORDINAL
at O
th' O
copy O
and O
then O
at O
my O
letters O
, O
for O
all O
the O
world O
like O
a O
cock O
picking O
up O
grains O
o' O

But O
one S-CARDINAL
thing O
startled O
me O
e'en O
then O
, O
and O
I O
thought O
I'd O
make O
bold O
to O
ask O
the O
surgeon O
the O
meaning O
o't O
. O
I've O
gotten O
no O
head O
for O
numbers O
, O
but O
this O
I O
know O
, O
that O
by O
far O
th' O
greater O
part O
o' O
th' O

as O
comed O
in O

happened O
in O

last O
two B-TIME

o' O
work O
, O
when O
folk O
getten O
tired O
and O
careless O
. O
Th' O
surgeon O
said O
it O
were O
all O
true O
, O
and O
that O
he O
were O
going O
to O
bring O
that O
fact O
to O
light O
. O
" O
Jem S-PERSON
was O
pondering O
Mary's S-PERSON
conduct O

but O
the O
pause O
made O
him O
aware O
he O
ought O
to O
utter O
some O
civil O
listening O
noise O

so O
he O
said O
" O
Very O
true O
. O
" O
" O
Ay O
, O
it's O
true O
enough O
, O
my O
lad O
, O
that O
we're O
sadly O
over O
- O
borne O
, O
and O
worse O
will O
come O
of O
it O
afore O

But O
there's O
many O
a O
thing O
will O
happen O
afore O

as O
folk O
don't O

Yo O
may O
take O
my O
word O
for O
that O
, O
Jem S-PERSON
. O
" O
Jem S-PERSON
was O
very O
willing O
to O
take O
it O
, O
but O
did O
not O
express O
the O
curiosity O
he O
should O
have O
done O
. O
So O
John B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
thought O
he'd O
try O
another O
hint O
or O
two S-CARDINAL

" O

' O
had O

So O
, O
if O

us O
no O

they O

try O
higher O
folk O

" O
Still O
Jem S-PERSON
was O
not O
curious O
. O
He O
gave O
up O
hope O
of O
seeing O
Mary S-PERSON
again O
by O
her O
own O
good O
free O
will O

and O
the O
next O
best O
thing O
would O
be O
, O
to O
be O
alone O
to O
think O
of O
her O
. O
So O
, O
muttering O
something O
which O
he O
meant O
to O
serve O
as O
an O
excuse O
for O
his O
sudden O
departure O
, O
he O
hastily O
wished O
John S-PERSON
good O
afternoon O
, O
and O
left O
him O
to O
resume O
his O
pipe O

his O
politics O

For O
three B-DATE
years E-DATE
past O

worse O

the O

only O
wanted O
a O
Dante S-PERSON
to O
record O
their O

And O
yet O
even O
his O
words O
would O
fall O
short O
of O

Even O

were O
forced O

own O

in O
their O
endeavour O
to O
ascertain O
the O
real O
causes O
of O
the O
misery O

the O
whole O
matter O
was O
of O
so O
complicated O
a O
nature O
, O
that O
it O
became O
next O
to O
impossible O
to O
understand O
it O
thoroughly O

It O
need O
excite O

that O
a O
bad O
feeling O
between O
working O

men O

the O
upper O
classes O
became O
very O
strong O

this O
season O
of O
privation O
. O
The O
indigence O
and O
sufferings O
of O
the O
operatives O
induced O
a O
suspicion O
in O
the O
minds O

many O

that O
their O

were O

prostration O

enthralment O

The O
most O
deplorable O

enduring O
evil O
that O
arose O
out O
of O
the O
period O

was O
this O
feeling O

alienation O
between O

different O
classes O
of O
society O

It O
is O
so O
impossible O
to O
describe O
, O
or O
even O
faintly O
to O
picture O

the O
state O
of O
distress O

prevailed O
in O
the O

that O
I O
will O
not O
attempt O
it O

think O
again O

in O
a O
Christian S-NORP

it O
was O
not O
known O
even O
so O
feebly O

could O
tell O
it O

the O
more O
happy O

fortunate O
would O
have O
thronged O
with O
their O
sympathy O

their O
aid O
. O
In O
many O
instances O
the O
sufferers O
wept O
first S-ORDINAL

then O
they O
cursed O
. O
Their O
vindictive O
feelings O
exhibited O
themselves O
in O
rabid O
politics O

An O
idea O
was O

springing O
up O
among O
the O

that O
originated O
with O
the O

which O
came O
at O

cherished O
as O
a O
darling O
child O
by O
many O

many O
a O

They O
could O
not O
believe O
that O
government O
knew O
of O
their O
misery O

they O
rather O
chose O
to O
think O
it O
possible O
that O
men O
could O
voluntarily O
assume O
the O
office O
of O

for O
a O
nation O
, O
ignorant O

who O
should O
make O

of O
children O

without O
caring O
to O
know O

had O
been O
kept O
for O
days S-DATE
without O

Besides O
, O
the O
starving O

had O
heard O

that O
the O
very O
existence O
of O
their O
distress O
had O
been O
denied O
in O
Parliament S-ORG

and O
though O
they O
felt O
this O
strange O

inexplicable O
, O
yet O
the O
idea O
that O
their O
misery O
had O
still O
to O
be O
revealed O
in O
all O
its O
depths O

that O
then O
some O

There O

that O

a O

There O
was O
the O

many O
grand O

that O
went O
a O
little O
further O

last O
, O
there O
was O
the O
really O
pure O
gladness O
of O
heart O

arising O
from O
the O
idea O
that O
he O

instruments O
in O

Barton S-PERSON

many O

Job B-PERSON

Barton S-PERSON
was O
saved O

answering O
, O
by O
the O
entrance O
of O
Mrs. O

the O
poor O

she O
took O

called O
out O

dangling O
a O

: O

said O
Mrs. O

in O
a O

There O
was O
something O
crooked O
in O
her O
conscience O
after O
all O

for O
this O
very O
resolution O
seemed O
an O
acknowledgment O
that O
it O
was O
wrong O
to O
meet O
him O
at O
any O
time O

and O
yet O
she O
had O
brought O
herself O
to O
think O
her O
conduct O
quite O
innocent O
and O
proper O
, O
for O
although O
unknown O
to O
her O
father O
, O
and O
certain O
, O
even O
did O
he O
know O
it O
, O
to O
fail O
of O
obtaining O
his O
sanction O
, O
she O
esteemed O
her O
love O

meetings O

sure O
to O
end O

But O
now O
that O
he O
was O
away O

would O
do O
nothing O

he O
would O
disapprove O

no O

not O

it O
was O

a O
confidant O

Mary's S-PERSON
love O
affair O
, O
made O
so O
by O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
himself O
. O
He O
had O
felt O
the O
necessity O
of O
some O
third S-ORDINAL
person O
to O
carry O
letters O
and O
messages O
, O
and O
to O
plead O
his O
cause O
when O
he O
was O
absent O
. O
In O
a O
girl O
named O
Sally B-PERSON
Leadbitter E-PERSON
he O
had O
found O
a O
willing O
advocate O
. O
She O
would O
have O
been O
willing O
to O
have O
embarked O
in O
a O
love O

affair O
herself O

a O
clandestine O
one O

, O
for O
the O
mere O
excitement O
of O
the O
thing O

but O
her O
willingness O
was O
strengthened O
by O
sundry O
half S-CARDINAL
- O
sovereigns O
, O
which O
from O
time O
to O
time O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
bestowed O
upon O
her O
. O
Sally B-PERSON
Leadbitter E-PERSON
was O
vulgar O
- O
minded O
to O
the O
last O
degree O
| | O
never O
easy O
unless O
her O
talk O
was O
of O
love O
and O
lovers O

in O
her O
eyes O
it O
was O
an O
honour O
to O
have O
had O
a O
long O
list O
of O
wooers O
. O
So O
constituted O
, O
it O
was O
a O
pity O
that O
Sally S-PERSON
herself O
was O
but O
a O
plain O
, O
red-haired O
, O
freckled O
girl O

never O
likely O

one O
would O
have O
thought O

to O
become O
a O
heroine O
on O
her O
own O
account O

But O
what O
she O
lacked O
in O
beauty O
she O
tried O
to O
make O
up O
for O
by O
a O
kind O
of O
witty O
boldness O
, O
which O
gave O
her O
what O
her O
betters O
would O
have O
called O
piquancy O
. O
Considerations O
of O
modesty O
or O
propriety O
never O
checked O
her O
utterance O
of O
a O
good O
thing O
. O
She O
had O
just O
talent O
enough O
to O
corrupt O
others O
. O
Her O
very O
good O
- O
nature O
was O
an O
evil O
influence O
. O
They O
could O
not O
hate O
one O
who O
was O
so O
kind O

they O
could O
not O
avoid O
one O
who O
was O
so O
willing O
to O
shield O
them O
from O
scrapes O
by O
any O
exertion O
of O
her O
own O

whose O
ready O
fingers O
would O
at O
any O

make O
up O

their O
deficiencies O

whose O
still O
more O

" O

" O
Ay O

' O

" O
Nonsense O

pouting O

I O

I'm O

him O

asked O
Sally S-PERSON
. O
" O
If O
you O
like O

" O
replied O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
" O
I'm O
sure O
I O
don't O

weeping O
afresh O

But O
Sally S-PERSON
did O
not O
like O
to O
be O
the O
bearer O
of O
any O
such O

She O
saw O
she O

gone O
on O
the O
wrong O
tack O

that O
Mary's S-PERSON
heart O
was O
too O
full O
to O
value O
either O
message O

letter O

she O
ought O

So O
she O
wisely O
paused O
in O
their O
delivery O
, O
and O
said O
in O
a O
more O
sympathetic O
tone O
than O
she O
had O
heretofore O
used O
, O
" O
Do O

her O

for O
one B-TIME

on O

the O
next O
hiding O
her O

anew O

if O
I'd O
been O
going O
to O
play O
at O
ball O
wi' O
'em O

You O
may O
guess O
I O
felt O
squeamish O
, O
but O
mine O
weren't O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
song O
, O
and O
th' O
music O
sounded O
like O
a O
friend's O
voice O
, O
telling O
me O
to O
take O
courage O
. O
So O
to O
make O
a O
long O
story O
short O
, O
when O
it O
were O
all O
o'er O
th' O
lecturer O
thanked O
me O

th' O

said O
as O
how O
there O
never O
was O
a O
new O

so O
applauded O
( O
for O
they'd O
clapped O
and O
stamped O
after O
I'd O
done O
, O
till O
I O
began O
to O
wonder O
how O
many O
pair O
o' O
shoes O
they'd O
get O
through O
a O
week O
at O
that O
rate O
, O
let O
alone O
their O
hands O

Thursday S-DATE

I O
got O
a O
sovereign O
last B-TIME
night E-TIME

am O
to O
have O
half O
- O
a- O
sovereign O
every O

at O
th' O
Mechanics O

" O
" O
Well O
, O
Margaret S-PERSON
, O
I'm O
right O
glad O
to O
hear O
it O
. O
" O
" O
And O
I O
don't O
think O
you've O
heard O
the O
best O
bit O
yet O
. O
Now O
that O
a O
way O
seemed O
opened O
to O
me O
, O
of O
not O
being O
a O
burden O
to O
any O
one O
, O
though O
it O
did O
please O
God O
to O
make O
me O
blind O
, O
I O
thought O
I'd O
tell O
grandfather O
. O
I O
only O
telled O
him O
about O
the O
singing O
and O
the O
sovereign O
last O
night O
, O
for O
I O
thought O
I'd O
not O
send O
him O
to O
bed O
wi' O
a O
heavy O
heart O
| | O
but O
this O
morning O
I O
telled O
him O
all O
. O
" O
" O
And O
how O
did O
he O
take O
it O
? O
" O
" O
He's O
not O
a O
man O
of O
many O
words O
| | O
and O
it O
took O
him O
by O
surprise O
like O
. O
" O
" O
I O
wonder O
at O
that O
| | O
I've O
noticed O
it O
in O
your O
ways O
ever O
since O
you O
telled O
me O
. O
" O
" O
Ay O
, O
that's O
it O
! O
If O
I'd O
not O
telled O
you O
, O
and O
you'd O
seen O
me O
every O
day O
, O
you'd O
not O
ha O
' O
noticed O
the O
little O
mite O
o' O
difference O
fra O
' O
day O
to O
day O
. O
" O
" O
Well O
, O
but O
what O
did O
your O
grandfather O
say O
? O
" O
" O
Why O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
Margaret S-PERSON
, O
half O
smiling O
, O
" O
I'm O
a O
bit O
loath O
to O
tell O
yo O
, O
for O
unless O
yo O
knew O
grandfather's O
ways O
like O
me O
, O
yo'd O
think O
it O
strange O
. O
He O
were O
taken O
by O
surprise O
, O
and O
he O
said O
: O
' O
Damn O
yo O
! O
' O
Then O
he O
began O
looking O
at O
his O
book O
as O
it O
were O
, O
and O
were O
very O
quiet O
, O
while O
I O
telled O
him O
all O
about O
it O

how O
I'd O
feared O
, O
and O
how O
downcast O
I'd O
been O

and O
how O
I O
were O
now O
reconciled O
to O
it O
, O
if O
it O
were O
th' O
Lord's O
will O

and O
how O
I O
hoped O
to O
earn O
money O
by O
singing O

and O
while O
I O
were O
talking O
, O
I O
saw O
great O
big O
tears O
come O
dropping O
on O
th' O
book O

but O
in O
course O
I O
never O
let O
on O
that O
I O
saw O
'em O

Dear O
grandfather O
! O
and O
all O
day O
long O
he's O
been O
quietly O
moving O
things O
out O
o' O
my O
way O

he O
thought O
might O

me O
up O

putting O
things O
in O
my O
way O

felt O
what O
he O
were O
doing O

for O

he O
thinks O
I'm O
out O

out O
blind O

I O
guess O
— O

I O
shall O
be O
soon O

" O
Margaret S-PERSON
sighed O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
her O
cheerful O
and O
relieved O
tone O
. O
Though O
Mary S-PERSON
caught O
the O
sigh O
, O
she O
felt O
it O
was O
better O
to O
let O
it O
pass O
without O
notice O
, O
and O
began O
, O
with O
the O
tact O
which O
true O
sympathy O
rarely O
fails O
to O
supply O
, O
to O
ask O
a O
variety O
of O
questions O
respecting O
her O
friend's O
musical O
debut O
, O
which O
tended O
to O
bring O
out O
more O
distinctly O
how O
successful O
it O
had O
been O
. O
" O
Why O
, O
Margaret S-PERSON
, O
" O
at O
length O
she O
exclaimed O

some O
o' O

they O
were O
a'most O
certain O
it O
were O
a O
song O
o' O

he O
were O
so O
fidgetty O

particular O
about O

weighed O
down O
her O

not O

So O
I O
got O

I O
had O
to O

by O
th' O

, O
I O
were O
so O
weak O

She O
led O
me O
into O

where O
Jennings S-PERSON

She O

There O
were O

But O
she O
still O
said O
, O
' O
Come O
here O
, O
' O
and O
took O
hold O
o' O

So O
I O
went O
round O

I O
did O

and O
there O
lay O
a O
little O
wee O
babby O
fast O
asleep O
. O
My O
heart O
gave O
a O
leap O
, O
and O
th' O
tears O
comed O
rushing O
into O
my O
eyes O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
that O
day O
. O
' O
Is O
it O
hers O

I O
, O
though O
I O

' O
Yes O

' O
She O
were O
getting O

and O
th' O

were O
born O

and O
then O
the O
poor O
young O
man O
took O
worse O
and O
died O
, O
and O
she O
were O
not O
many O
hours O
behind O

' O
" O
Little O
mite O
of O
a O

and O
yet O
it O
seemed O
her O
angel O
come O
back O
to O
comfort O
me O
. O
I O
were O
quite O
jealous O
o' O
Jennings S-PERSON
whenever O
he O
went O
near O
the O
babby O
. O
I O
thought O
it O
were O
more O
my O
flesh O
and O
blood O
than O
his'n O
, O
and O
yet O
I O
were O
afeared O
he O
would O
claim O
it O
. O
However O
, O
that O
were O
far O
enough O
fra O
' O
his O
thoughts O

he'd O
plenty O
other O
childer O
, O
and O
as O
I O
found O
out O
at O
after O
he'd O
all O
along O
been O
wishing O
me O
to O
take O
it O
. O
Well O
, O
we O
buried O
Margaret S-PERSON
and O
her O
husband O
in O
a O
big O
, O
crowded O
, O
lonely O
churchyard O
in O
London S-GPE
. O
I O
were O
loath O
to O
leave O
them O
there O
, O
as O
I O
thought O
, O
when O
they O
rose O
again O
, O
they'd O
feel O
so O
strange O
at O
first O
away O
fra O
Manchester S-GPE
, O
and O
all O
old O
friends O

it O
couldna O

Well O
, O
God O
watches O
o'er O
their O
grave O
there O
as O
well O
as O
here O
. O
That O
funeral O
cost O
a O
mint O
o' O
money O
, O
but O
Jennings S-PERSON
and O
I O
wished O
to O
do O
th' O
thing O
decent O
. O
Then O
we'd O
the O
stout O
little O
babby O
to O
bring O
home O
. O
We'd O
not O
overmuch O
money O
left O

but O
it O
were O
fine O
weather O
, O
and O
we O
thought O
we'd O
take O
th' O
coach O
to O
Brummagem S-ORG
, O
and O
walk O
on O
. O
It O
were O
a O
bright O
May O
morning O
when O
last O
I O
saw O

looking O
back O
from O
a O
big O
hill O
a O
mile O
or O
two S-CARDINAL

And O
in O
that O
big O
mass O
o' O
a O
place O
I O
were O
leaving O
my O
blessed O
child O
asleep O
— O
in O
her O
last O
sleep O

Well O
, O
God's O
will O
be O
done O
! O
She's S-PERSON
gotten O
to O
heaven O
afore O

I O
shall O
get O
there O
at O
last O

God O
, O
though O
it's O
a O

" O
The O

had O
been O
fed O
afore O
we O
set O
out O

and O
th' O
coach O
moving O
kept O
it O
asleep O
, O
bless O
its O
little O
heart O

But O
when O
th' O
coach O
stopped O
for O
dinner O
it O
were O
awake O
, O
and O
crying O
for O
its O
pobbies O

So O
we O
asked O
for O
some O
bread O

Jennings S-PERSON
took O
it O

it O
made O

at O

wi O

— O
The O
agricultural O
labourer O
generally O
has O
strong O
local O
attachments O

but O
they O
are O
far O
less O
common O
, O
almost O
obliterated O
, O
among O
the O
inhabitants O
of O
a O
town O
. O
Still O
there O
are O
exceptions O
, O
and O
Barton S-PERSON
formed O
one O
. O
He O
had O
removed O
to O
his O
present O
house O
just O
after O
the O
last O
bad O
times O
, O
when O
little O
Tom S-PERSON
had O
sickened O
and O
died O
. O
He O
had O
then O
thought O
the O
bustle O
of O
a O
removal O
would O
give O
his O
poor O
stunned O
wife O
something O
to O
do O
, O
and O
he O
had O
taken O
more O
interest O
in O
the O
details O
of O
the O
proceeding O
than O
he O
otherwise O
would O
have O
done O
, O
in O
the O
hope O
of O
calling O
her O
forth O
to O
action O
again O
. O
So O
he O
seemed O
to O
know O
every O
brass O
- O
headed O
nail O
driven O
up O
for O
her O
convenience O
. O
One S-CARDINAL
only O
had O
been O
displaced O
. O
It O
was O
Esther's O
bonnet O
nail O
, O
which O
, O
in O
his O
deep O
revengeful O
anger O
against O
her O
, O
after O
his O
wife's O
death O
, O
he O
had O
torn O
out O
of O
the O
wall O
, O
and O
cast O
into O
the O
street O
. O
It O
would O
be O
hard O
work O
to O
leave O
that O
house O
, O
which O
yet O
seemed O
hallowed O
by O
his O
wife's O
presence O
in O
the O
happy O
days O
of O
old O
. O
But O
he O
was O
a O
law O
unto O
himself O
, O
though O
sometimes O
a O
bad O
, O
fierce O
law O
| | O
and O
he O
resolved O
to O
give O
the O
rent O
- O
collector O
notice O
, O
and O
look O
out O
for O
a O
cheaper O
abode O
, O
and O
tell O
Mary S-PERSON
they O
must O
flit O
. O
Poor O
Mary S-PERSON
! O
she O
loved O
the O
house O
, O
too O
. O
It O
was O
wrenching O
up O
her O
natural O
feelings O
of O
home O
, O
for O
it O
would O
be O
long O
before O
the O
fibres O
of O
her O
heart O
would O
gather O
themselves O
about O
another O
place O
. O
This O
trial O
was O
spared O
. O
The O
collector O
( O
of O
himself O
) O
, O
on O
the O
very O
Monday S-DATE
when O
Barton S-PERSON
planned O
to O
give O
him O
notice O
of O
his O
intention O
to O
leave O
, O
lowered O
the O
rent O
threepence O
a O
week O
, O
just O
enough O
to O
make O
Barton S-PERSON
compromise O
and O
agree O
to O
stay O
on O
a O
little O
longer O
. O
But O
by O
degrees O
the O
house O
was O
stripped O
of O
its O
little O
ornaments O
. O
Some O
were O
broken O
| | O
and O
the O
odd O
twopences O
and O
threepences O
wanted O
to O
pay O
for O
their O
repairs O
, O
were O
required O
for O
the O
far O
sterner O
necessity O
of O
food O
. O
And O
by O
- O
and O
- O
bye O
Mary S-PERSON
began O
to O
part O
with O
other O
superfluities O
at O
the O
pawn O
- O
shop O
. O
The O
smart O
tea-tray O
and O
tea-caddy O
, O
long O
and O
carefully O
kept O
, O
went O
for O
bread O
for O
her O
father O
. O
He O
did O
not O
ask O
for O
it O
, O
or O
complain O
, O
but O
she O
saw O
hunger O
in O
his O
shrunk O
, O
fierce O
, O
animal O
look O
. O
Then O
the O
blankets O
went O
, O
for O
it O
was O
summer O
time O
, O
and O
they O
could O
spare O
them O
| | O
and O
their O
sale O
made O
a O
fund O
, O
which O
Mary S-PERSON
fancied O
would O
last O
till O
better O
times O
came O
. O
But O
it O
was O
soon O
all O
gone O
| | O
and O
then O
she O
looked O
around O
the O
room O
to O
crib O
it O
of O
its O
few O
remaining O
ornaments O
. O
To O
all O
these O
proceedings O
her O
father O
said O
never O
a O
word O
. O
If O
he O
fasted O
, O
or O
feasted O
( O
after O
the O
sale O
of O
some O
article O
) O
, O
on O
an O
unusual O
meal O
of O
bread O
and O
cheese O
, O
he O
took O
all O
with O
a O
sullen O
indifference O
, O
which O
depressed O
Mary's S-PERSON
heart O
. O
She O
often O
wished O
he O
would O
apply O
for O
relief O
from O
the O
Guardian's S-ORG
relieving O
office O
| | O
often O
wondered O
the B-GPE
Trades' I-GPE
Union E-GPE
did O
nothing O
for O
him O
. O
Once O
when O
she O
asked O
him O
as O
he O
sat O
, O
grimed O
, O
unshaven O
, O
and O
gaunt O
, O
after O
a O
day's O
fasting O
over O
the O
fire O
, O
why O
he O
did O
not O
get O
relief O
from O
the O
town O
, O
he O
turned O
round O
, O
with O
grim O
wrath O
, O
and O
said O
, O
" O
I O
don't O

He O
would O
bear O
it O
all O
, O
he O
said O
to O
himself O
. O
And O
he O
did O
bear O
it O
, O
but O
not O
meekly O

that O
was O
too O
much O
to O
expect O

Real O
meekness O
of O
character O
is O
called O
out O
by O
experience O
of O
kindness O

And O
few O
had O
been O
kind O
to O
him O

Yet O
through O
it O
all O
, O
with O
stern O
determination O
he O
refused O
the O
assistance O

would O
have O
given O
him O

It O
had O
not O
much O
to O
give O
, O
but O
with O
worldly O
wisdom O
, O
thought O
it O
better O
to O
propitiate O
an O
active O
, O
useful O

than O
to O
help O
those O

had O
large O

Not O
so O
thought O
John B-PERSON

With O
him O
need O
was O
right O

" O

" O
he O
said O

seven S-CARDINAL

" O
Now O
Tom B-PERSON

grumbling O

settled O

girls O
had O
been O
dazzled O
and O
lured O
by O
gold O
, O
even O
without O
the O
betraying O
love O
which O
she O
believed O
to O
exist O
in O
Mary's S-GPE
heart O
. O
So O
she O
urged O
young O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
, O
by O
representations O
of O
the O
want O
she O
was O
sure O
surrounded O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
to O
bring O
matters O
more O
to O
a O
point O
. O
But O
he O
had O
a O
kind O
of O
instinctive O
dread O
of O
hurting O
Mary's S-PERSON
pride O
of O
spirit O
, O
and O
durst O
not O
hint O
his O
knowledge O
in O
any O
way O
of O
the O
distress O
that O
many O
must O
be O
enduring O
. O
He O
felt O
that O
for O
the O
present O
he O
must O
still O
be O
content O
with O
stolen O
meetings O
and O
summer O
evening O
strolls O
, O
and O
the O
delight O
of O
pouring O
sweet O
honeyed O
words O
into O
her O
ear O
, O
while O
she O
listened O
with O
a O
blush O
and O
a O
smile O
that O
made O
her O
look O
radiant O
with O
beauty O
. O
No O
, O
he O
would O
be O
cautious O
in O
order O
to O
be O
certain O
| | O
for O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
one S-CARDINAL
way O
or O
another O
, O
he O
must O
make O
his O
. O
He O
had O
no O
doubt O
of O
the O
effect O
of O
his O
own O
personal O
charms O
in O
the O
long O
run O
| | O
for O
he O
knew O
he O
was O
handsome O
, O
and O
believed O
himself O
fascinating O
. O
If O
he O
had O
known O
what O
Mary's S-PERSON
home O
was O
, O
he O
would O
not O
have O
been O
so O
much O
convinced O
of O
his O
increasing O
influence O
over O
her O
, O
by O
her O
being O
more O
and O
more O
ready O
to O
linger O
with O
him O
in O
the O
sweet O
summer O
air O
. O
For O
when O
she O
returned O
for O
the O
night O
her O
father O
was O
often O
out O
, O
and O
the O
house O
wanted O
the O
cheerful O
look O
it O
had O
had O
in O
the O
days O
when O
money O
was O
never O
wanted O
to O
purchase O
soap O
and O
brushes O
, O
black O
- O
lead O
and O
pipe O
- O
clay O
. O
It O
was O
dingy O
and O
comfortless O
| | O
for O
, O
of O
course O
, O
there O
was O
not O
even O
the O
dumb O
familiar O
home O
- O
friend O
, O
a O
fire O
. O
And O
Margaret S-PERSON
, O
too O
, O
was O
now O
so O
often O
from O
home O
, O
singing O
at O
some O
of O
those O
grand O
places O
. O
And O
Alice S-PERSON
| | O
oh O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
wished O
she O
had O
never O
left O
her O
cellar O
to O
go O
and O
live O
at O
Ancoats S-GPE
with O
her O
sister O
- O
in O
- O
law O
. O
For O
in O
that O
matter O
Mary S-PERSON
felt O
very O
guilty O
| | O
she O
had O
put O
off O
and O
put O
off O
going O
to O
see O
the O
widow O
after O
George B-PERSON
Wilson's E-PERSON
death O
from O
dread O
of O
meeting O
Jem S-PERSON
, O
or O
giving O
him O
reason O
to O
think O
she O
wished O
to O
be O
as O
intimate O
with O
him O
as O
formerly O
| | O
and O
now O
she O
was O
so O
much O
ashamed O
of O
her O
delay O
that O
she O
was O
likely O
never O
to O
go O
at O
all O
. O
If O
her O
father O
was O
at O
home O
it O
was O
no O
better O
| | O
indeed O
it O
was O
worse O
. O
He O
seldom O
spoke O
, O
less O
than O
ever O
| | O
and O
often O
when O
he O
did O
speak O
they O
were O
sharp O
angry O
words O
, O
such O
as O
he O
had O
never O
given O
her O
formerly O
. O
Her O
temper O
was O
high O
, O
too O
, O
and O
her O
answers O
not O
over O
- O
mild O
| | O
and O
once O
in O
his O
passion O
he O
had O
even O
beaten O
her O
. O
If O
Sally B-PERSON
Leadbitter E-PERSON
or O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
had O
been O
at O
hand O
at O
that O
moment O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
would O
have O
been O
ready O
to O
leave O
home O
for O
ever O
. O
She O
sat O
alone O
, O
after O
her O
father O
had O
flung O
out O
of O
the O
house O
, O
bitterly O
thinking O
on O
the O
days O
that O
were O
gone O
| | O
angry O
with O
her O
own O
hastiness O
, O
and O
believing O
that O
her O
father O
did O
not O
love O
her O
| | O
striving O
to O
heap O
up O
one S-CARDINAL
painful O
thought O
on O
another O
. O
Who O
cared O
for O
her O
? O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
might O
, O
but O
in O
this O
grief O
that O
seemed O
no O
comfort O
. O
Mother O
dead O
! O
Father O
so O
often O
angry O
, O
so O
lately O
cruel O
( O
for O
it O
was O
a O
hard O
blow O
, O
and O
blistered O
and O
reddened O
Mary's O
soft O
white O
skin O
with O
pain O
) O
: O
and O
then O
her O
heart O
turned O
round O
, O
and O
she O
remembered O
with O
self O
- O
reproach O
how O
provokingly O
she O
had O
looked O
and O
spoken O
, O
and O
how O
much O
her O
father O
had O
to O
bear O
| | O
and O
oh O
, O
what O
a O
kind O
and O
loving O
parent O
he O
had O
been O
, O
till O
these O
days O
of O
trial O
. O
The O
remembrance O
of O
one S-CARDINAL
little O
instance O
of O
his O
fatherly O
love O
thronged O
after O
another O
into O
her O
mind O
, O
and O
she O
began O
to O
wonder O
how O
she O
could O
have O
behaved O
to O
him O
as O
she O
had O
done O
. O
Then O
he O
came O
home O
| | O
and O
but O
for O
very O
shame O
she O
would O
have O
confessed O
her O
penitence O
in O
words O
. O
But O
she O
looked O
sullen O
, O
from O
her O
effort O
to O
keep O
down O
emotion O
| | O
and O
for O
some O
time O
her O
father O
did O
not O
know O
how O
to O
begin O
to O
speak O
. O
At O
length O
he O
gulped O
down O
pride O
, O
and O
said O
: O
" O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
I'm O
not O
above O
saying O
I'm O
very O
sorry O
I O
beat O
thee O
. O
Thou O
wert O
a O
bit O
aggravating O
, O
and O
I'm O
not O
the O
man O
I O
was O
. O
But O
it O
were O
wrong O
, O
and O
I'll S-PERSON
try O
never O
to O
lay O
hands O
on O
thee O
again O
. O
" O
So O
he O
held O
out O
his O
arms O
, O
and O
in O
many O
tears O
she O
told O
him O
her O
repentance O
for O
her O
fault O
. O
He O
never O
struck O
her O
again O
. O
Still O
, O
he O
often O
was O
angry O
. O
But O
that O
was O
almost O
better O
than O
being O
silent O
. O
Then O
he O
sat O
near O
the O
fire O
- O
place O
( O
from O
habit O
) O
, O
smoking O
, O
or O
chewing O
opium O
. O
Oh O
, O
how O
Mary S-PERSON
loathed O
that O
smell O
! O
And O
in O
the O
dusk O
, O
just O
before O
it O
merged O
into O
the O
short O
summer O
night O
, O
she O
had O
learned O
to O
look O
with O
dread O
towards O
the O
window O
, O
which O
now O
her O
father O
would O
have O
kept O
uncurtained O
| | O
for O
there O
were O
not O
seldom O
seen O
sights O
which O
haunted O
her O
in O
her O
dreams O
. O
Strange O
faces O
of O
pale O
men O
, O
with O
dark O
glaring O
eyes O
, O
peered O
into O
the O
inner O
darkness O
, O
and O
seemed O
desirous O
to O
ascertain O
if O
her O
father O
were O
at O
home O
. O
Or O
a O
hand O
and O
arm O
( O
the O
body O
hidden O
) O
was O
put O
within O
the O
door O
, O
and O
beckoned O
him O
away O
. O
He O
always O
went O
. O
And O
once O
or O
twice O
, O
when O
Mary S-PERSON
was O
in O
bed O
, O
she O
heard O
men's O
voices O
below O
, O
in O
earnest O
, O
whispered O
talk O
. O
They O
were O
all O
desperate O
members O
of O
Trades' B-ORG
Unions E-ORG
, O
ready O
for O
any O
thing O

made O

While O
all O
this O
change O
for O
gloom O
yet O
struck O
fresh O
and O
heavy O
on O
Mary's S-PERSON
heart O
, O
her O
father O
startled O
her O
out O
of O
a O
reverie O
one O
evening O
, O
by O
asking O
her O
when O
she O
had O
been O
to O
see O
Jane B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
. O
From O
his O
manner O
of O
speaking O
, O
she O
was O
made O
aware O
that O
he O
had O
been O
| | O
but O
at O
the O
time O
of O
his O
visit O
he O
had O
never O
mentioned O
any O
thing O
about O
it O
. O
Now O
, O
however O
, O
he O
gruffly O
told O
her O
to O
go O
next B-DATE
day E-DATE
without O
fail O
, O
and O
added O
some O
abuse O
of O
her O
for O
not O
having O
been O
before O
. O
The O
little O
outward O
impulse O
of O
her O
father's O
speech O
gave O
Mary S-PERSON
the O
push O
which O
she O
, O
in O
this O

required O

covered O
her O

sat O
down O
to O
cry O

" O

such O

in O
a O
less O

up O

A O
fresh O
burst O

her O

the O
poor O

at O

very O
red O

wished O

" O

there O

keeping O
as O
I O

five B-DATE

such O

The O
day O
after O

he O
goes O
to O
his O
work O
at O
after O

' O
Jenny S-PERSON

th' O
cold O

' O
I O
were O

God O

how O
anxious O

And O
yet O
I'd O
no O

I O
know'd O

I O
know'd O
their O
skins O
were O
taken O
off O

that O
were O
all O

So O
I O
tidyed O
my O
house O
in O
a O
rough O
kind O
o' O
way O
, O
and O
then O
I O
looked O
at O
that O
very O
clock O
up O
yonder O

" O
pointing O
at O
one O

I O
seed O
it O
were O
nine O

so O
, O
thinks O
I O
, O
th' O
potatoes O
shall O
be O
well O
boiled O
at O
any O

I O
gets O
' O
em O
on O

a O
jiffy O

that's O
to O

as O
soon O

I O
could O
peel O

were O
a O
tough O
job O
at O
first S-ORDINAL

I O
fell O
to O
unpacking O
my O
boxes O

at O
twenty B-TIME

past I-TIME
twelve E-TIME
he O
comes O
home O

I O
had O
th' O
beef O
ready O
on O
th' O
table O

I O
went O
to O
take O
the O
potatoes O
out O

pot O

oh O
! O
Mary S-PERSON

th' O
water O

boiled O
away O

they O
were O
all O
a O
nasty O
brown O
mass O

as O
smelt O
through O
all O
the O
house O

said O
nought O

were O
very O
gentle O

, O
oh O

I O
cried O

ne'er O

it O

no O

many O

none O

Alice S-PERSON

caught O
much O
of O

" O
I O

ought O

he'd O
like O

not O

the O

on O
rarely O

" O
Mary S-PERSON
went O
very O
red O

looked O
annoyed O
, O

there O
was O
a O
secret O
spring O

joy O
deep O
down O
in O
her O
heart O

at O
hearing O

so O
spoken O

But O
his O
mother O
only O
saw O
the O
annoyed O
look O
, O
and O
was O
piqued O
accordingly O
. O
She O
was O
not O
over O

above O
desirous O
that O
her O
son O
should O
marry O

His O
presence O
in O
the O
house O
seemed O
a O
relic O
of O
happier O
times O

and O
she O
had O
some O
little O
jealousy O
of O
his O

whoever O
she O
might O

Still O
she O
could O
not O

any O

flattered O
by O

full O

Now O
she O

never O

still O
rankled O
a O
little O
in O

she O
determined O

little O

away O

been O
casting O
sheep's O
eyes O
at O
our O
Jem O

many O
a O
day O

he O

her O
father O

not O
give O
her O
to O
a O
common O
working O
man O

now O
he's O
as O
good O
as O
her O

every O
bit O

I O
thought O
once O
he'd O
a O
fancy O
for O
thee O

but O
I O
donnot O
think O
yo'd O
ever O
ha O
' O
suited O
, O
so O
it's O
best O
as O
it O
is O
. O
" O
By O
an O
effort O
Mary S-PERSON
managed O
to O
keep O
down O
her O
vexation O
, O
and O
to O
say O
, O
" O
She O
hoped O
he'd O
be O
happy O
with O
Molly B-PERSON

She O
was O
very O
handsome O

" O
" O
Ay O

a O
notable O
body O

too O

just O
step O
up O

show O
you O
the O
patchwork O
quilt O

gave O
me O

last B-DATE
Saturday E-DATE
. O
" O
Mary S-PERSON
was O
glad O
she O
was O
going O
out O
of O
the O
room O
. O
Her O
words O
irritated O
her O
| | O
perhaps O
not O
the O
less O
because O
she O
did O
not O
fully O
believe O
them O
. O
Besides O
she O
wanted O
to O
speak O
to O
Alice S-PERSON
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Wilson S-PERSON
seemed O
to O
think O
that O
she O
, O
as O
the O
widow O
, O
ought O
to O
absorb O
all O
the O
attention O
. O
" O
Dear O
Alice S-PERSON
, O
" O
began O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
" O
I'm O
so O
grieved O
to O
find O
you O
so O
deaf O

it O
must O
have O
come O
on O
very O
rapid O
. O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
dear O
, O
it's O
a O
trial O

I'll O
not O
deny O
it O
. O
Pray O
God O
give O
me O
strength O
to O
find O
out O
its O
teaching O
. O
I O
felt O
it O
sore O
one O
fine O
day O
when O
I O
thought O
I'd O
go O
gather O
some O
meadow O
- O
sweet O
to O
make O
tea O
for O
Jane's O
cough O
| | O
and O
the O
fields O
seemed O
so O
dree O
and O
still O
, O
and O
at O
first O
I O
could O
na O
make O
out O
what O
was O
wanting O
| | O
and O
then O
it O
struck O
me O
it O
were O
th' O
song O
o' O
the O
birds O
, O
and O
that O
I O
never O
should O
hear O
their O
sweet O
music O
no O
more O
, O
and O
I O
could O
na O
help O
crying O
a O
bit O
. O
But O
I've O
much O
to O
be O
thankful O
for O
. O
I O
think O
I'm O
a O
comfort O
to O
Jane S-PERSON
, O
if O
I'm O
only O
some O
one O
to O
scold O
now O
and O
then O
| | O
poor O
body O
! O
It O
takes O
off O
her O
thoughts O
from O
her O
sore O
losses O
when O
she O
can O
scold O
a O
bit O
. O
If O
my O
eyes O
are O
left O
I O
can O
do O
well O
enough O
| | O
I O
can O
guess O
at O
what O
folk O
are O
saying O
. O
" O
The O
splendid O
red O
and O
yellow O
patch O
quilt O
now O
made O
its O
appearance O
, O
and O
Jane B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
would O
not O
be O
satisfied O
unless O
Mary S-PERSON
praised O
it O
all O
over O
, O
border O
, O
centre O
, O
and O
ground O
- O
work O
, O
right O
side O
and O
wrong O
| | O
and O
Mary S-PERSON
did O
her O
duty O
, O
saying O
all O
the O
more O
, O
because O
she O
could O
not O
work O
herself O
up O
to O
any O
very O
hearty O
admiration O
of O
her O
rival's O
present O
. O
She O
made O
haste O
, O
however O
, O
with O
her O
commendations O
, O
in O
order O
to O
avoid O
encountering O
Jem S-PERSON
. O
As O
soon O
as O
she O
was O
fairly O
away O
from O
the O
house O
and O
street O
, O
she O
slackened O
her O
pace O
, O
and O
began O
to O
think O
. O
Did O
Jem S-PERSON
really O
care O
for O
Molly B-PERSON
Gibson E-PERSON
? O
Well O
, O
if O
he O
did O
, O
let O
him O
. O
People O
seemed O
all O
to O
think O
he O
was O
much O
too O
good O
for O
her O
( O
Mary's S-PERSON
own O
self O
) O
. O
Perhaps O
some O
one O
else O
, O
far O
more O
handsome O
, O
and O
far O
more O
grand O
, O
would O
show O
him O
one O
day O
that O
she O
was O
good O
enough O
to O
be O
Mrs. O
Henry B-PERSON
Carson E-PERSON
. O
So O
temper O
, O
or O
what O
Mary S-PERSON
called O
" O
spirit O
, O
" O
led O
her O
to O
encourage O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
more O
than O
ever O
she O
had O
done O
before O
. O
Some B-DATE
weeks E-DATE
after O
this O
, O
there O
was O
a O
meeting O
of O
the B-ORG
Trades' I-ORG
Union E-ORG
to O
which O
John B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
belonged O
. O
The B-TIME
morning I-TIME
of I-TIME
the I-TIME
day E-TIME
on O
which O
it O
was O
to O
take O
place O
he O
had O
lain O
late O
in O
bed O
, O
for O
what O
was O
the O
use O
of O
getting O
up O
? O
He O
had O
hesitated O
between O
the O
purchase O
of O
meal O
or O
opium O
, O
and O
had O
chosen O
the O
latter O
, O
for O
its O
use O
had O
become O
a O
necessity O
with O
him O
. O
He O
wanted O
it O
to O
relieve O
him O
from O
the O
terrible O
depression O
its O
absence O
occasioned O
. O
A O
large O
lump O
seemed O
only O
to O
bring O
him O
into O
a O
natural O
state O
, O
or O
what O
had O
been O
his O
natural O
state O
formerly O
. O
Eight B-TIME
o'clock I-TIME
was I-TIME
the I-TIME
hour E-TIME
fixed O
for O
the O
meeting O
| | O
and O
at O
it O
were O
read O
letters O
, O
filled O
with O
details O
of O
woe O
, O
from O
all O
parts O
of O
the O
country O
. O
Fierce O
, O
heavy O
gloom O
brooded O
over O
the O
assembly O
| | O
and O
fiercely O
and O
heavily O
did O
the O
men O
separate O
, O
towards O
eleven B-TIME
o'clock E-TIME
, O
some O
irritated O
by O
the O
opposition O
of O
others O
to O
their O
desperate O
plans O
. O
It O
was O
not O
a O
night O
to O
cheer O
them O
, O
as O
they O
quitted O
the O
glare O
of O
the O
gas- O
lighted O
room O
, O
and O
came O
out O
into O
the O
street O
. O
Unceasing O
, O
soaking O
rain O
was O
falling O
| | O
the O
very O
lamps O
seemed O
obscured O
by O
the O
damp O
upon O
the O
glass O
, O
and O
their O
light O
reached O
but O
to O
a O
little O
distance O
from O
the O
posts O
. O
The O
streets O
were O
cleared O
of O
passers O
- O
by O
| | O
not O
a O
creature O
seemed O
stirring O
, O
except O
here O
and O
there O
a O
drenched O
policeman O
in O
his O
oil O
- O
skin O
cape O
. O
Barton S-PERSON
wished O
the O
others O
good O
night O
, O
and O
set O
off O
home O
. O
He O
had O
gone O
through O
a O
street O
or O
two S-CARDINAL
, O
when O
he O
heard O
a O
step O
behind O
him O
| | O
but O
he O
did O
not O
care O
to O
look O
and O
see O
who O
it O
was O
. O
A O
little O
further O
, O
and O
the O
person O
quickened O
step O
, O
and O
touched O
his O
arm O
very O
lightly O
. O
He O
turned O
, O
and O
saw O
, O
even O
by O
the O
darkness O
visible O
of O
that O
badly O
- O
lighted O
street O
, O
that O
the O
woman O
who O
stood O
by O
him O
was O
of O
no O
doubtful O
profession O
. O
It O
was O
told O
by O
her O
faded O
finery O
, O
all O
unfit O
to O
meet O
the O
pelting O
of O
that O
pitiless O
storm O

the O
gauze O
bonnet O
, O
once O
pink O
, O
now O
dirty O
white O

the O
muslin O
gown O

all O
draggled O

and O
soaking O
wet O
up O
to O
the O
very O
knees O

the O
gay O
- O
coloured O
barège O
shawl O
, O
closely O
wrapped O
round O
the O
form O
, O
which O
yet O
shivered O
and O
shook O
, O
as O
the O
woman O
whispered O
: O
" O
I O
want O
to O
speak O
to O
you O
. O
" O
He O
swore O
an O
oath O
, O
and O
bade O
her O
begone O
. O
" O
I O
really O
do O
. O
Don't O
send O
me O
away O
. O
I'm O
so O
out O
of O
breath O
, O
I O
cannot O
say O
what O
I O
would O
all O
at O
once O
. O
" O
She O
put O
her O
hand O
to O
her O
side O
, O
and O
caught O
her O
breath O
with O
evident O
pain O
. O
" O
I O
tell O
thee O
I'm O
not O
the O
man O
for O
thee O

" O
adding O
an O
opprobrious O
name O
. O
" O
Stay O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
as O
a O
thought O
suggested O
by O
her O
voice O
flashed O
across O
him O
. O
He O
gripped O
her O
arm O
— O
the O
arm O
he O
had O
just O
before O
shaken O
off O
, O
and O
dragged O
her O
, O
faintly O
resisting O
, O
to O
the O
nearest O
lamp O

post O
. O
He O
pushed O
her O
bonnet O
back O
, O
and O
roughly O
held O
the O
face O
she O
would O
fain O
have O
averted O
, O
to O
the O
light O
, O
and O
in O
her O
large O
, O
unnaturally O
bright O
gray O
eyes O
, O
her O
lovely O
mouth O
, O
half O
open O

as O
if O
imploring O
the O
forbearance O
she O
could O
not O
ask O
for O
in O
words O

Esther S-PERSON

who O
had O
caused O
his O

Much O
was O
like O
the O
gay O
creature O
of O
former O

the O
glaring O

expression O
of O
the O

But O
most O
of O

never O

at O
the O

point O
to O
thee O
as O
her O
murderer O

if O
she O
don't O

" O
He O
flung O
her O
, O
trembling O
, O
sickening O
, O
fainting O
, O
from O
him O
, O
and O
strode O
away O
. O
She O
fell O
with O
a O
feeble O
scream O
against O
the O
lamp O
- O
post O
, O
and O
lay O
there O
in O
her O
weakness O
, O
unable O
to O
rise O
. O
A O
policeman O
came O
up O
in O
time O
to O
see O
the O
close O
of O
these O
occurrences O
, O
and O
concluding O
from O
Esther's S-PERSON
unsteady O
, O
reeling O
fall O
, O
that O
she O
was O
tipsy O
, O
he O
took O
her O
in O
her O
half S-CARDINAL

unconscious O
state O
to O
the O
lock O

The O
superintendent O
of O
that O

of O
vice O

misery O
was O
roused O
from O
his O
dozing O
watch O
through O
the O
dark O
hours O
, O
by O
half S-CARDINAL
- O
delirious O
wails O
and O
moanings O
, O
which O
he O
reported O
as O
arising O
from O
intoxication O
. O
If O
he O
had O
listened O
, O
he O
would O
have O
heard O
these O
words O
, O
repeated O
in O
various O
forms O
, O
but O
always O
in O
the O

way O

He O

She O
won't O
hearken O

heed O
it O
more O
than O
I O
did O

who O

her O
well O
enough O

watch O
over O

Barton S-PERSON
returned O
home O
after O
his O
encounter O
with O
Esther S-PERSON
, O
uneasy O
and O
dissatisfied O
. O
He O
had O
said O
no O
more O
than O
he O
had O
been O
planning O
to O
say O
for O
years S-DATE
, O
in O
case O
she O
was O
ever O
thrown O
in O
his O
way O
, O
in O
the O
character O
in O
which O
he O
felt O
certain O
he O
should O
meet O
her O
. O
He O
believed O
she O
deserved O
it O
all O
, O
and O
yet O
he O
now O
wished O
he O
had O
not O
said O
it O
. O
Her O
look O
, O
as O
she O
asked O
for O
mercy O
, O
haunted O
him O
through O
his O
broken O
and O
disordered O
sleep O
| | O
her O
form O
, O
as O
he O
last O
saw O
her O
, O
lying O
prostrate O
in O
helplessness O
, O
would O
not O
be O
banished O
from O
his O
dreams O
. O
He O
sat O
up O
in O
bed O
to O
try O
and O
dispel O
the O
vision O
. O
Now O
, O
too O
late O
, O
his O
conscience O
smote O
him O
for O
his O
harshness O
. O
It O
would O
have O
been O
all O
very O
well O
, O
he O
thought O
, O
to O
have O
said O
what O
he O
did O
, O
if O
he O
had O
added O
some O
kind O
words O
, O
at O
last O
. O
He O
wondered O
if O
his O
dead O
wife O
was O
conscious O
of O
that O
night's O
occurrence O
| | O
and O
he O
hoped O
not O
, O
for O
with O
her O
love O
for O
Esther S-PERSON
he O
believed O
it O
would O
embitter O
Heaven O
to O
have O
seen O
her O
so O
degraded O
and O
repulsed O
. O
For O
he O
now O
recalled O
her O
humility O
, O
her O
tacit O
acknowledgment O
of O
her O
lost O
character O
| | O
and O
he O
began O
to O
marvel O
if O
there O
was O
power O
in O
the O
religion O
he O
had O
often O
heard O
of O
, O
to O
turn O
her O
from O
her O
ways O
. O
He O
felt O
that O
no O
earthly O
power O
that O
he O
knew O
of O
could O
do O
it O
, O
but O
there O
glimmered O
on O
his O
darkness O
the O
idea O
that O
religion O
might O
save O
her O
. O
Still O
, O
where O
to O
find O
her O
again O
? O
In O
the O
wilderness O
of O
a O
large O
town O
, O
where O
to O
meet O
with O
an O
individual O
of O
so O
little O
value O
or O
note O
to O
any O
? O
And O
evening B-TIME
after I-TIME
evening E-TIME
he O
paced O
those O
streets O
in O
which O
he O
had O
heard O
her O
footsteps O
following O
him O
, O
peering O
under O
every O
fantastic O
, O
discreditable O
bonnet O
, O
in O
the O
hopes O
of O
once O
more O
meeting O
Esther S-PERSON
, O
and O
addressing O
her O
in O
a O
far O
different O
manner O
from O
what O
he O
had O
done O
before O
. O
But O
he O
returned O
, O
night B-TIME
after I-TIME
night E-TIME
, O
disappointed O
in O
his O
search O
, O
and O
at O
last O
gave O
it O
up O
in O
despair O
, O
and O
tried O
to O
recall O
his O
angry O
feelings O
towards O
her O
, O
in O
order O
to O
find O
relief O
from O
his O
present O
self O
- O
reproach O
. O
He O
often O
looked O
at O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
and O
wished O
she O
were O
not O
so O
like O
her O
aunt O
, O
for O
the O
very O
bodily O
likeness O
seemed O
to O
suggest O
the O
possibility O
of O
a O
similar O
likeness O
in O
their O
fate O
| | O
and O
then O
this O
idea O
enraged O
his O
irritable O
mind O
, O
and O
he O
became O
suspicious O
and O
anxious O
about O
Mary's S-PERSON
conduct O
. O
Now O
hitherto O
she O
had O
been O
so O
remarkably O
free O
from O
all O
control O
, O
and O
almost O
from O
all O
inquiry O
concerning O
her O
actions O
, O
that O
she O
did O
not O
brook O
this O
change O
in O
her O
father's O
behaviour O
very O
well O
. O
Just O
when O
she O
was O
yielding O
more O
than O
ever O
to O
Mr. O
Carson's S-PERSON
desire O
of O
frequent O
meetings O
, O
it O
was O
hard O
to O
be O
so O
questioned O
concerning O
her O
hours O
of O
leaving O
off O
work O
, O
whether O
she O
had O
come O
straight O
home O
, O
&amp O
| | O
c O
. O
She O
could O
not O
tell O
lies O
| | O
though O
she O
could O
conceal O
much O
if O
she O
were O
not O
questioned O
. O
So O
she O
took O
refuge O
in O
obstinate O
silence O
, O
alleging O
as O
a O
reason O
for O
it O
her O
indignation O
at O
being O
so O
cross-examined O
. O
This O
did O
not O
add O
to O
the O
good O
feeling O
between O
father O
and O
daughter O
, O
and O
yet O
they O
dearly O
loved O
each O
other O
| | O
and O
in O
the O
minds O
of O
each O
, O
one S-CARDINAL
principal O
reason O
for O
maintaining O
such O
behaviour O
as O
displeased O
the O
other O
, O
was O
the O
believing O
that O
this O
conduct O
would O
insure O
that O
person's O
happiness O
. O
Her O
father O
now O
began O
to O
wish O
Mary S-PERSON
were O
married O
. O
Then O
this O
terrible O
superstitious O
fear O
suggested O
by O
her O
likeness O
to O
Esther S-PERSON
would O
be O
done O
away O
with O
. O
He O
felt O
that O
he O
could O
not O
resume O
the O
reins O
he O
had O
once O
slackened O
. O
But O
with O
a O
husband O
it O
would O
be O
different O
. O
If O
Jem B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
would O
but O
marry O
her O
! O
With O
his O
character O
for O
steadiness O
and O
talent O
! O
But O
he O
was O
afraid O
Mary S-PERSON
had O
slighted O
him O
, O
he O
came O
so O
seldom O
now O
to O
the O
house O
. O
He O
would O
ask O
her O
. O
" O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
what's O
come O
o'er O
thee O
and O
Jem B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
? O
Yo O
were O
great O
friends O
at O
one S-CARDINAL
time O
. O
" O
" O
Oh O
, O
folk O
say O
he's O
going O
to O
be O
married O
to O
Molly B-PERSON
Gibson E-PERSON
, O
and O
of O
course O
courting O
takes O
up O
a O
deal O
o' O
time O
, O
" O
answered O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
as O
indifferently O
as O
she O
could O
. O
" O
Thou'st S-PERSON
played O
thy O
cards O
badly O
, O
then O
, O
" O
replied O
her O
father O
, O
in O
a O
surly O
tone O
. O
" O
At O
one O
time O
he O
were O
desperate O
fond O
o' O
thee O
, O
or O
I'm O
much O
mistaken O
. O
Much O
fonder O
of O
thee O
than O
thou O
deservedst O
. O
" O
" O
That's O
as O
people O
think O
, O
" O
said O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
pertly O
, O
for O
she O
remembered O
that O
the O
very O
morning O
before O
she O
had O
met O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
sighed O
, O
and O
swore O
, O
and O
protested O
all O
manner O
of O
tender O
vows O
that O
she O
was O
the O
loveliest O
, O
sweetest O
, O
best O
, O
&amp O
| | O
c O
. O
And O
when O
she O
had O
seen O
him O
afterwards O
riding O
with O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
his O
beautiful O
sisters O
, O
had O
he O
not O
evidently O
pointed O
her O
out O
as O
in O
some O
way O
or O
other O
an O
object O
worthy O
of O
attention O
and O
interest O
, O
and O
then O
lingered O
behind O
his O
sister's O
horse O
for O
a O
moment O
to O
kiss O
his O
hand O
repeatedly O
. O
So O
, O
as O
for O
Jem B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
, O
she O
could O
whistle O
him O
down O
the O
wind O
. O
But O
her O
father O
was O
not O
in O
the O
mood O
to O
put O
up O
with O
pertness O
, O
and O
he O
upbraided O
her O
with O
the O
loss O
of O
Jem B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
till O
she O
had O
to O
bite O
her O
lips O
till O
the O
blood O
came O
, O
in O
order O
to O
keep O
down O
the O
angry O
words O
that O
would O
rise O
in O
her O
heart O
. O
At O
last O
her O
father O
left O
the O
house O
, O
and O
then O
she O
might O
give O
way O
to O
her O
passionate O
tears O
. O
It O
so O
happened O
that O
Jem S-PERSON
, O
after O
much O
anxious O
thought O
, O
had O
determined O
that O
day O
to O
" O
put O
his O
fate O
to O
the O
touch O
, O
to O
win O
or O
lose O
it O
all O
. O
" O
He O
was O
in O
a O
condition O
to O
maintain O
a O
wife O
in O
comfort O
. O
It O
was O
true O
his O
mother O
and O
aunt O
must O
form O
part O
of O
the O
household O
| | O
but O
such O
is O
not O
an O
uncommon O
case O
among O
the O
poor O
, O
and O
if O
there O
were O
the O
advantage O
of O
previous O
friendship O
between O
the O
parties O
, O
it O
was O
not O
, O
he O
thought O
, O
an O
obstacle O
to O
matrimony O
. O
Both O
mother O
and O
aunt O
he O
believed O
would O
welcome O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
And O
oh O
! O
what O
a O
certainty O
of O
happiness O
the O
idea O
of O
that O
welcome O
implied O
. O
He O
had O
been O
absent O
and O
abstracted O
all O
day O
long O
with O
the O
thought O
of O
the O
coming O
event O
of O
the O
evening O
. O
He O
almost O
smiled O
at O
himself O
for O
his O
care O
in O
washing O
and O
dressing O
in O
preparation O
for O
his O
visit O
to O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
As O
if O
one S-CARDINAL
waistcoat O
or O
another O
could O
decide O
his O
fate O
in O
so O
passionately O
momentous O
a O
thing O
. O
He O
believed O
he O
only O
delayed O
before O
his O
little O
looking O
- O
glass O
for O
cowardice O
, O
for O
absolute O
fear O
of O
a O
girl O
. O
He O
would O
try O
not O
to O
think O
so O
much O
about O
the O
affair O
, O
and O
he O
thought O
the O
more O
. O
Poor O
Jem S-PERSON
! O
it O
is O
not O
an O
auspicious O
moment O
for O
thee O
! O
" O
Come O
in O
, O
" O
said O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
as O
some O
one O
knocked O
at O
the O
door O
, O
while O
she O
sat O
sadly O
at O
her O
sewing O
, O
trying O
to O
earn O
a B-MONEY
few I-MONEY
pence E-MONEY
by O
working O
over O
hours O
at O
some O
mourning O
. O
Jem S-PERSON
entered O
, O
looking O
more O
awkward O
and O
abashed O
than O
he O
had O
ever O
done O
before O
. O
Yet O
here O
was O
Mary S-PERSON
all O
alone O
, O
just O
as O
he O
had O
hoped O
to O
find O
her O
. O
She O
did O
not O
ask O
him O
to O
take O
a O
chair O
, O
but O
after O
standing O
a B-TIME
minute I-TIME
or I-TIME
two E-TIME
he O
sat O
down O
near O
her O
. O
" O
Is O
your O
father O
at O
home O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
? O
" O
said O
he O
, O
by O
way O
of O
making O
an O
opening O
, O
for O
she O
seemed O
determined O
to O
keep O
silence O
, O
and O
went O
on O
stitching O
away O
. O
" O
No O
, O
he's O
gone O
to O
his O
Union S-ORG
, O
I O
suppose O
. O
" O
Another O
silence O
. O
It O
was O
no O
use O
waiting O
, O
thought O
Jem S-PERSON
. O
The O
subject O
would O
never O
be O
led O
to O
by O
any O
talk O
he O
could O
think O
of O
in O
his O
anxious O
fluttered O
state O
. O
He O
had O
better O
begin O
at O
once O
. O
" O
Mary S-PERSON
! O
" O
said O
he O
, O
and O
the O
unusual O
tone O
of O
his O
voice O
made O
her O
look O
up O
for O
an O
instant O
, O
but O
in O
that O
time O
she O
understood O
from O
his O
countenance O
what O
was O
coming O
, O
and O
her O
heart O
beat O
so O
suddenly O
and O
violently O
she O
could O
hardly O
sit O
still O
. O
Yet O
one S-CARDINAL
thing O
she O
was O
sure O
of O
| | O
nothing O
he O
could O
say O
should O
make O
her O
have O
him O
. O
She O
would O
show O
them O
all O
who O
would O
be O
glad O
to O
have O
her O
. O
She O
was O
not O
yet O
calm O
after O
her O
father's O
irritating O
speeches O
. O
Yet O
her O
eyes O
fell O
veiled O
before O
that O
passionate O
look O
fixed O
upon O
her O
. O
" O
Dear O
Mary S-PERSON
! O
( O
for O
how O
dear O
you O
are O
, O
I O
cannot O
rightly O
tell O
you O
in O
words O

. O
It's O
no O
new O
story O
I'm O
going O
to O
speak O
about O

You O
must O
ha O
' O
seen O

we O
were O
boy O

girl O

I O
ha O
' O
loved O
you O
above O
father O

mother O

all O

and O
all O
I've O
thought O
on O
by O
day O

dreamt O
on O
by O
night O
, O
has O
been O
something O
in O
which O
you've O
had O
a O
share O
. O
I'd O
no O
way O
of O
keeping O
you O
for O
long O
, O
and O
I O
scorned O
to O
try O
and O
tie O
you O
down O

and O
I O
lived O
in O
terror O
lest O
some O
one O
else O
should O
take O
you O
to O
himself O
. O
But O
now O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
I'm O
foreman O
in O
th' O
works O
, O
and O
, O
dear O
Mary S-PERSON
! O
listen O
, O
" O
as O
she O
, O
in O
her O
unbearable O
agitation O
, O
stood O
up O
and O
turned O
away O
from O
him O
. O
He O
rose O
, O
too O
, O
and O
came O
nearer O
, O
trying O
to O
take O
hold O
of O
her O
hand O

but O
this O
she O
would O
not O
allow O
. O
She O
was O
bracing O
herself O
up O
to O
refuse O
him O
, O
for O
once O
and O
for O
all O
. O
" O
And O
now O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
I've O
a O
home O
to O
offer O
you O
, O
and O
a O
heart O
as O
true O
as O
ever O
man O

shall O
never O

rich O
folk O

dare O
say O

if O
a O
loving O
heart O
and O
a O
strong O
right O
arm O
can O
shield O
you O
from O
sorrow O
, O
or O
from O
want O

mine O

do O
it O

I O
cannot O
speak O
as O
I O
would O
like O

my O
love O

itself O

oh O
! O
darling O

say O
you O
believe O
me O

that O
you'll O
be O
mine O

" O
She O
could O
not O
speak O
at O
once O

words O

not O

they O
say O
silence O
gives O
consent O

it O
so O
? O

he O
whispered O

" O
No O
! O
it O
does O
not O
with O
me O

" O
Her O
voice O
was O
calm O
, O
although O
she O
trembled O
from O
head O
to O
foot O
. O
" O
I O
will O
always O

mournfully O

" O
Oh O
Mary S-PERSON

think O
awhile O

you O

awhile O

me O
hopeless O

desperate O

It's O
no O
love O
of O
yesterday S-DATE

has O
made O
the O
very O
groundwork O
of O
all O
that O
people O
call O
good O
in O
me O

I O
don't O
know O
what O

be O
if O
you O
won't O

me O

, O
Mary S-PERSON
! O
think O
how O
glad O
your O
father O
would O
be O
! O
it O
may O
sound O
vain O
, O
but O
he's O
told O
me O
more O
than O
once O
how O
much O
he O
should O
like O
to O
see O
us O
two S-CARDINAL
married O
! O
" O
Jem S-PERSON
intended O
this O
for O
a O
powerful O
argument O
, O
but O
in O
Mary's S-PERSON
present O
mood O
it O
told O
against O
him O
more O
than O
any O
thing O
| | O
for O
it O
suggested O
the O
false O
and O
foolish O
idea O
, O
that O
her O
father O
, O
in O
his O
evident O
anxiety O
to O
promote O
her O
marriage O
with O
Jem S-PERSON
, O
had O
been O
speaking O
to O
him O
on O
the O
subject O
with O
some O
degree O
of O
solicitation O
. O
" O
I O
tell O
you O
, O
Jem S-PERSON

it O
cannot O

you O

is O
this O
the O
end O

all O
my O
hopes O

fears O

the O
end O
of O
my O
life O

I O
may O

for O
it O
is O
the O
end O
of O
all O
worth O
living O
for O
! O
" O
His O
agitation O
rose O
and O
carried O
him O
into O
passion O

" O
Mary S-PERSON
! O
you'll O
hear O
, O
may O
be O
, O
of O
me O
as O
a O
drunkard O

may O
be O
as O
a O
thief O

may O

a O
murderer O

ill O

me O

you O
will O
have O
no O

your O
cruelty O

you O

said O
he O
, O
suddenly O
changing O
his O
tone O
from O
threatening O
despair O
to O
fond O
passionate O
entreaty O

as O
he O
took O
her O
hand O
and O
held O
it O
forcibly O
between O
both O
of O
his O
, O
while O
he O
tried O
to O
catch O
a O
glimpse O
of O
her O
averted O
face O

She O
was O
silent O
, O

it O
was O
from O
deep O
and O
violent O
emotion O

He O
could O
not O
bear O
to O
wait O

he O
would O
not O
hope O
, O
to O
be O
dashed O
away O
again O

he O
rather O
in O
his O
bitterness O
of O
heart O
chose O
the O
certainty O
of O
despair O
, O
and O
before O
she O
could O
resolve O
what O
to O
answer O

he O
flung O
away O
her O
hand O

rushed O
out O
of O
the O
house O

" O
Jem O
! O
Jem O

cried O
she O
, O
with O
faint O
and O
choking O
voice O

It O
was O
too O
late O

he O
left O
street O
after O
street O
behind O
him O
with O
his O
almost O
winged O
speed O
, O
as O
he O
sought O
the O
fields O

where O
he O
might O
give O
way O
unobserved O
to O
all O
the O
deep O
despair O

It O
was O
scarcely O
ten B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
since O
he O
had O
entered O
the O
house O

found O
Mary S-PERSON
at O
comparative O
peace O
, O

now O
she O
lay O
half O
across O
the O
dresser O

her O
head O
hidden O
in O
her O
hands O

every O
part O

body O
shaking O
with O
the O
violence O

her O
sobs O

why O
she O
was O
in O
such O
agonised O
grief O

It O
was O
too O
sudden O
for O
her O
to O
analyse O
, O
or O
think O
upon O
it O

She O
only O
felt O
that O
by O
her O
own O

her O
life O
would O
be O
hereafter O
dreary O

blank O

exhausted O

power O

no O
strength O
left O
for O
crying O

sat O
down O

little I-TIME

yet O

pretty O
much O
what O
she O
did O
, O
if O
the O
occasion O

, O
that O
we O
look O
with O
loathing O
on O
the O
very O
thing O
we O
have O
most O
desired O
. O
A O
few O
moments O
may O
change O
our O
character O
for O
life O
, O
by O
giving O
a O
totally O
different O
direction O
to O
our O
aims O
and O
energies O
. O
To O
return O
to O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
Her O
plan O
had O
been O
, O
as O
we O
well O
know O
, O
to O
marry O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
, O
and O
the O
occurrence O
an B-TIME
hour I-TIME
ago E-TIME
was O
only O
a O
preliminary O
step O
. O
True O
| | O
but O
it O
had O
unveiled O
her O
heart O
to O
her O
| | O
it O
had O
convinced O
her O
she O
loved O
Jem S-PERSON
above O
all O
persons O
or O
things O
. O
But O
Jem S-PERSON
was O
a O
poor O
mechanic O
, O
with O
a O
mother O
and O
aunt O
to O
keep O
| | O
a O
mother O
, O
too O
, O
who O
had O
shown O
her O
pretty O
clearly O
she O
did O
not O
desire O
her O
for O
a O
daughter O
- O
in O
- O
law O
: O
while O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
was O
rich O
, O
and O
prosperous O
, O
and O
gay O
, O
and O
( O
she O
believed O
) O
would O
place O
her O
in O
all O
circumstances O
of O
ease O
and O
luxury O
, O
where O
want O
could O
never O
come O
. O
What O
were O
these O
hollow O
vanities O
to O
her O
, O
now O
she O
had O
discovered O
the O
passionate O
secret O
of O
her O
soul O
? O
She O
felt O
as O
if O
she O
almost O
hated O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
decoyed O
her O
with O
his O
baubles O
. O
She O
now O
saw O
how O
vain O
, O
how O
nothing O
to O
her O
, O
would O
be O
all O
gaieties O
and O
pomps O
, O
all O
joys O
and O
pleasures O
, O
unless O
she O
might O
share O
them O
with O
Jem S-PERSON
| | O
yes O
, O
with O
him O
she O
harshly O
rejected O
so O
short O
a O
time O
ago O
. O
If O
he O
were O
poor O
, O
she O
loved O
him O
all O
the O
better O
. O
If O
his O
mother O
did O
think O
her O
unworthy O
of O
him O
, O
what O
was O
it O
but O
the O
truth O
, O
as O
she O
now O
owned O
with O
bitter O
penitence O
. O
She O
had O
hitherto O
been O
walking O
in O
grope O
- O
light O
towards O
a O
precipice O
| | O
but O
in O
the O
clear O
revelation O
of O
that B-TIME
past I-TIME
hour E-TIME
, O
she O
saw O
her O
danger O
, O
and O
turned O
away O
resolutely O
and O
for O
ever O
. O
That O
was O
some O
comfort O
: O
I O
mean O
her O
clear O
perception O
of O
what O
she O
ought O
not O
to O
do O
| | O
of O
what O
no O
luring O
temptation O
should O
ever O
again O
induce O
her O
to O
hearken O
to O
. O
How O
she O
could O
best O
undo O
the O
wrong O
she O
had O
done O
to O
Jem S-PERSON
and O
herself O
by O
refusing O
his O
love O
, O
was O
another O
anxious O
question O
. O
She O
wearied O
herself O
with O
proposing O
plans O
, O
and O
rejecting O
them O
. O
She O
was O
roused O
to O
a O
consciousness O
of O
time O
by O
hearing O
the O
neighbouring O
church O
clock O
strike O
twelve S-CARDINAL
. O
Her O
father O
she O
knew O
might O
be O
expected O
home O
any O
minute O
, O
and O
she O
was O
in O
no O
mood O
for O
a O
meeting O
with O
him O
. O
So O
she O
hastily O
gathered O
up O
her O
work O
, O
and O
went O
to O
her O
own O
little O
bed- O
room O
, O
leaving O
him O
to O
let O
himself O
in O
. O
She O
put O
out O
her O
candle O
, O
that O
her O
father O
might O
not O
see O
its O
light O
under O
the O
door O
| | O
and O
sat O
down O
on O
her O
bed O
to O
think O
. O
But O
after O
turning O
things O
over O
in O
her O
mind O
again O
and O
again O
, O
she O
could O
only O
determine O
at O
once O
to O
put O
an O
end O
to O
all O
further O
communication O
with O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
, O
in O
the O
most O
decided O
way O
she O
could O
. O
Maidenly O
modesty O
( O
and O
true O
love O
is O
ever O
modest O
) O
seemed O
to O
oppose O
every O
plan O
she O
could O
think O
of O
, O
for O
showing O
Jem S-PERSON
how O
much O
she O
repented O
her O
decision O
against O
him O
, O
and O
how O
dearly O
she O
had O
now O
discovered O
that O
she O
loved O
him O
. O
She O
came O
to O
the O
unusual O
wisdom O
of O
resolving O
to O
do O
nothing O
, O
but O
try O
and O
be O
patient O
, O
and O
improve O
circumstances O
as O
they O
might O
turn O
up O
. O
Surely O
, O
if O
Jem S-PERSON
knew O
of O
her O
remaining O
unmarried O
, O
he O
would O
try O
his O
fortune O
again O
. O
He O
would O
never O
be O
content O
with O
one S-CARDINAL
rejection O
| | O
she O
believed O
she O
could O
not O
in O
his O
place O
. O
She O
had O
been O
very O
wrong O
, O
but O
now O
she O
would O
try O
and O
do O
right O
, O
and O
have O
womanly O
patience O
, O
until O
he O
saw O
her O
changed O
and O
repentant O
mind O
in O
her O
natural O
actions O
. O
Even O
if O
she O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
years S-DATE
, O
it O
was O
no O
more O
than O
now O
it O
was O
easy O
to O
look O
forward O
to O
, O
as O
a O
penance O
for O
her O
giddy O
flirting O
on O
the O
one S-CARDINAL
hand O
, O
and O
her O
cruel O
mistake O
concerning O
her O
feelings O
on O
the O
other O
. O
So O
anticipating O
a O
happy O
ending O
to O
the O
course O
of O
her O
love O
, O
however O
distant O
it O
might O
be O
, O
she O
fell O
asleep O
just O
as O
the O
earliest O
factory O
bells O
were O
ringing O
. O
She O
had O
sunk O
down O
in O
her O
clothes O
, O
and O
her O
sleep O
was O
unrefreshing O
. O
She O
wakened O
up O
shivery O
and O
chill O
in O
body O
, O
and O
sorrow O
- O
stricken O
in O
mind O
, O
though O
she O
could O
not O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
rightly O
tell O
the O
cause O
of O
her O
depression O
. O
She O
recalled O
the O
events O
of O
the O
night O
before O
, O
and O
still O
resolved O
to O
adhere O
to O
those O
determinations O
she O
had O
then O
formed O
. O
But O
patience O
seemed O
a O
far O
more O
difficult O
virtue O
this B-TIME
morning E-TIME
. O
She O
hastened O
down O
- O
stairs O
, O
and O
in O
her O
earnest O
sad O
desire O
to O
do O
right O
, O
now O
took O
much O
pains O
to O
secure O
a O
comfortable O
though O
scanty O
breakfast O
for O
her O
father O
| | O
and O
when O
he O
dawdled O
into O
the O
room O
, O
in O
an O
evidently O
irritable O
temper O
, O
she O
bore O
all O
with O
the O
gentleness O
of O
penitence O
, O
till O
at O
last O
her O
mild O
answers O
turned O
away O
wrath O
. O
She O
loathed O
the O
idea O
of O
meeting O
Sally B-PERSON
Leadbitter E-PERSON
at O
her O
daily S-DATE
work O
| | O
yet O
it O
must O
be O
done O
, O
and O
she O
tried O
to O
nerve O
herself O
for O
the O
encounter O
, O
and O
to O
make O
it O
at O
once O
understood O
, O
that O
having O
determined O
to O
give O
up O
having O
any O
thing O
further O
to O
do O
with O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
, O
she O
considered O
the O
bond O
of O
intimacy O
broken O
between O
them O
. O
But O
Sally S-PERSON
was O
not O
the O
person O
to O
let O
these O
resolutions O
be O
carried O
into O
effect O
too O
easily O
. O
She O
soon O
became O
aware O
of O
the O
present O
state O
of O
Mary's S-PERSON
feelings O
, O
but O
she O
thought O
they O
merely O
arose O
from O
the O
changeableness O
of O
girlhood O
, O
and O
that O
the O
time O
would O
come O
when O
Mary S-PERSON
would O
thank O
her O
for O
almost O
forcing O
her O
to O
keep O
up O
her O
meetings O
and O
communications O
with O
her O
rich O
lover O
. O
So O
, O
when O
two B-DATE
days E-DATE
had O
passed O
over O
in O
rather O
too O
marked O
avoidance O
of O
Sally S-PERSON
on O
Mary's S-PERSON
part O
, O
and O
when O
the O
former O
was O
made O
aware O
by O
Mr. O
Carson's S-PERSON
complaints O
that O
Mary S-PERSON
was O
not O
keeping O
her O
appointments O
with O
him O
, O
and O
that O
unless O
he O
detained O
her O
by O
force O
, O
he O
had O
no O
chance O
of O
obtaining O
a O
word O
as O
she O
passed O
him O
in O
the O
street O
on O
her O
rapid O
walk O
home O
, O
she O
resolved O
to O
compel O
Mary S-PERSON
to O
what O
she O
called O
her O
own O
good O
. O
She O
took O
no O
notice O
during O
the B-DATE
third I-DATE
day E-DATE
of O
Mary's S-PERSON
avoidance O
as O
they O
sat O
at O
work O
| | O
she O
rather O
seemed O
to O
acquiesce O
in O
the O
coolness O
of O
their O
intercourse O
. O
She O
put O
away O
her O
sewing O
early O
, O
and O
went O
home O
to O
her O
mother O
, O
who O
, O
she O
said O
, O
was O
more O
ailing O
than O
usual O
. O
The O
other O
girls O
soon O
followed O
her O
example O
, O
and O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
casting O
a O
rapid O
glance O
up O
and O
down O
the O
street O
, O
as O
she O
stood O
last O
on O
Miss O
Simmonds' O
door O
- O
step O
, O
darted O
homewards O
, O
in O
hopes O
of O
avoiding O
the O
person O
whom O
she O
was O
fast O
learning O
to O
dread O
. O
That O
night O
she O
was O
safe O
from O
any O
encounter O
on O
her O
road O
, O
and O
she O
arrived O
at O
home O
, O
which O
she O
found O
as O
she O
expected O
, O
empty O
| | O
for O
she O
knew O
it O
was O
a O
club O
night O
, O
which O
her O
father O
would O
not O
miss O
. O
She O
sat O
down O
to O
recover O
breath O
, O
and O
to O
still O
her O
heart O
, O
which O
panted O
more O
from O
nervousness O
than O
from O
over O
- O
exertion O
, O
although O
she O
had O
walked O
so O
quickly O
. O
Then O
she O
rose O
, O
and O
taking O
off O
her O
bonnet O
, O
her O
eye O
caught O
the O
form O
of O
Sally B-PERSON
Leadbitter E-PERSON
passing O
the O
window O
with O
a O
lingering O
step O
, O
and O
looking O
into O
the O
darkness O
with O
all O
her O
might O
, O
as O
if O
to O
ascertain O
if O
Mary S-PERSON
were O
returned O
. O
In O
an O
instant O
she O
re-passed O
and O
knocked O
at O
the O
house O
- O
door O
, O
but O
without O
awaiting O
an O
answer O
, O
she O
entered O
. O
" O
Well O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
dear O
" O
( O
knowing O
well O
how O
little O
" O
dear O
" O
Mary S-PERSON
considered O
her O
just O
then O
) O
| | O
" O
i's O
so O
difficult O
to O
get O
any O
comfortable O
talk O
at O
Miss O
Simmonds S-PERSON
' O
, O
I O
thought O
I'd O
just O
step O
up O
and O
see O
you O
at O
home O
. O
" O
" O
I O
understood O
from O
what O
you O
said O
your O
mother O
was O
ailing O
, O
and O
that O
you O
wanted O
to O
be O
with O
her O
, O
" O
replied O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
in O
no O
welcoming O
tone O
. O
" O
Ay O
, O
but O
mother's O
better O
now O
, O
" O
said O
the O
unabashed O
Sally S-PERSON
. O
" O
Your O
father's O
out O
I O
suppose O
? O
" O
looking O
round O
as O
well O
as O
she O
could O
| | O
for O
Mary S-PERSON
made O
no O
haste O
to O
perform O
the O
hospitable O
offices O
of O
striking O
a O
match O
, O
and O
lighting O
a O
candle O
. O
" O
Yes O
, O
he's O
out O
, O
" O
said O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
shortly O
, O
and O
busying O
herself O
at O
last O
about O
the O
candle O
, O
without O
ever O
asking O
her O
visitor O
to O
sit O
down O
. O
" O
So O
much O
the O
better O
, O
" O
answered O
Sally S-PERSON
, O
" O
for O
to O
tell O
you O
the O
truth O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
I've O
a O
friend O
at O
th' O
end O
of O
the O
street O
, O
as O
is O
anxious O
to O
come O
and O
see O
you O
at O
home O
, O
since O
you're O
grown O
so O
particular O
as O
not O

speak O
to O
him O
in O
the O
street O

He'll O
be O
here O
directly O

" O
" O
Oh O
, O
Sally S-PERSON
, O
don't O
let O
him O

" O
said O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
speaking O
at O
last O
heartily O

and O
running O
to O
the O
door O
she O
would O
have O
fastened O
it O
, O
but O
Sally S-PERSON
held O
her O
hands O
, O
laughing O
meanwhile O
at O
her O

said O
Sally S-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
more O
relenting O
mood O
, O
" O
I'll O
go O
back O
with O
you O
to O
where O
he's O
waiting O
for O
us O

or O
rather O
, O
I O
should O
say O
, O
where O
I O
told O
him O
to O
wait O
for O
a B-TIME
quarter I-TIME
of I-TIME
an I-TIME
hour E-TIME
, O
till O
I O
seed O
if O
your O

home O

and O
if O
I O
didn't O
come O
back O
in O
that O
time O
, O
he O
said O
he'd O
come O
here O

break O
the O
door O

he'd O

" O
" O
Oh O
, O
let O
us O
go O
, O
let O
us O
go O
, O
" O
said O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
feeling O
that O
the O
interview O
must O
be O
, O
and O
had O
better O
be O
anywhere O
than O
at O
home O
, O
where O
her O
father O
might O
return O
at O
any B-TIME
minute E-TIME
. O
She O
snatched O
up O
her O
bonnet O
, O
and O
was O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
court O
in O
an O
instant O
| | O
but O
then O
, O
not O
knowing O
whether O
to O
turn O
to O
the O
right O
or O
to O
the O
left O
, O
she O
was O
obliged O
to O
wait O
for O
Sally S-PERSON
, O
who O
came O
leisurely O
up O
, O
and O
put O
her O
arm O
through O
Mary's S-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
kind O
of O
decided O
hold O
, O
intended O
to O
prevent O
the O
possibility O
of O
her O
changing O
her O
mind O
, O
and O
turning O
back O
. O
But O
this O
, O
under O
the O
circumstances O
, O
was O
quite O
different O
to O
Mary's S-ORG
plan O
. O
She O
had O
wondered O
more O
than O
once O
if O
she O
must O
not O
have O
another O
interview O
with O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
| | O
and O
had O
then O
determined O
, O
while O
she O
expressed O
her O
resolution O
that O
it O
should O
be O
the O
final O
one O
, O
to O
tell O
him O
how O
sorry O
she O
was O
if O
she O
had O
thoughtlessly O
given O
him O
false O
hopes O
. O
For O
be O
it O
remembered O
, O
she O
had O
the O
innocence O
, O
or O
the O
ignorance O
, O
to O
believe O
his O
intentions O
honourable O
| | O
and O
he O
, O
feeling O
that O
at O
any O
price O
he O
must O
have O
her O
, O
only O
that O
he O
would O
obtain O
her O
as O
cheaply O
as O
he O
could O
, O
had O
never O
undeceived O
her O
| | O
while O
Sally B-PERSON
Leadbitter E-PERSON
laughed O
in O
her O
sleeve O
at O
them O
both O
, O
and O
wondered O
how O
it O
would O
all O
end O
, O
— O
whether O
Mary S-PERSON
would O
gain O
her O
point O
of O
marriage O
, O
with O
her O
sly O
affectation O
of O
believing O
such O
to O
be O
Mr. O
Carson's S-PERSON
intention O
in O
courting O
her O
. O
Not O
very O
far O
from O
the O
end O
of O
the O
street O
, O
into O
which O
the O
court O
where O
Mary S-PERSON
lived O
opened O
, O
they O
met O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
, O
his O
hat O
a O
good O
deal O
slouched O
over O
his O
face O
as O
if O
afraid O
of O
being O
recognised O
. O
He O
turned O
when O
he O
saw O
them O
coming O
, O
and O
led O
the O
way O
without O
uttering O
a O
word O
( O
although O
they O
were O
close O
behind O
) O
to O
a O
street O
of O
half S-CARDINAL
- O
finished O
houses O
. O
The O
length O
of O
the O
walk O
gave O
Mary S-PERSON
time O
to O
recoil O
from O
the O
interview O
which O
was O
to O
follow O
| | O
but O
even O
if O
her O
own O
resolve O
to O
go O
through O
with O
it O
had O
failed O
, O
there O
was O
the O
steady O
grasp O
of O
Sally B-PERSON
Leadbitter E-PERSON
, O
which O
she O
could O
not O
evade O
without O
an O
absolute O
struggle O
. O
At O
last O
he O
stopped O
in O
the O
shelter O
and O
concealment O
of O
a O
wooden O
fence O
, O
put O
up O
to O
keep O
the O
building O
rubbish O
from O
intruding O
on O
the O
foot O
- O
pavement O
. O
Inside O
this O
fence O
, O
a B-TIME
minute E-TIME
afterwards O
, O
the O
girls O
were O
standing O
by O
him O
| | O
Mary S-PERSON
now O
returning O
Sally's S-PERSON
detaining O
grasp O
with O
interest O
, O
for O
she O
had O
determined O
on O
the O
way O
to O
make O
her O
a O
witness O
, O
willing O
or O
unwilling O
, O
to O
the O
ensuing O
conversation O
. O
But O
Sally's S-PERSON
curiosity O
led O
her O
to O
be O
a O
very O
passive O
prisoner O
in O
Mary's S-GPE
hold O
. O
With O
more O
freedom O
than O
he O
had O
ever O
used O
before O
, O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
put O
his O
arm O
firmly O
round O
Mary's S-PERSON
waist O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
her O
indignant O
resistance O
. O
" O
Nay O
, O
nay O
! O
you O
little O
witch O

Mary S-PERSON
ceased O
struggling O
, O
but O
turned O
so O
as O
to O
be O
almost O
opposite O
to O
him O
, O
while O
she O
spoke O
out O
calmly O
and O
boldly O
, O
" O
Mr. O

want O
to O

For O
an O

was O
surprised O

the O
next O

vanity O
came O
to O
his O

convinced O

with O

off O

next O
sound O
was O
Sally's S-PERSON

grated O
on O

keenly O

I O
beg O

I O
humbly O
beg O
your O

Mary S-PERSON
says O

I O
can't O
help O
laughing O

to O
think O

she's O
outwitted O
us O

" O
( O
She O
was O
going O
to O
have O
said O
, O
" O
outwitted O
you O
, O
" O
but O
changed O
the O
pronoun O

) O
" O
Why O
, O
Sally S-PERSON
, O
had O
you O
any O
idea O
she O
was O
going O
to O
fly O
out O
in O
this O
style O
? O
" O
" O
No O
, O
I O
hadn't O
, O
to O
be O
sure O
. O
But O
if O
you O
did O
think O
of O
marrying O
her O
, O
why O
( O
if O
I O
may O
be O
so O
bold O
as O
to O
ask O
) O
did O
you O
go O
and O
tell O
her O
you O
had O
no O
thought O
of O
doing O
otherwise O
by O
her O
? O
That O
was O
what O
put O
her O
up O
at O
last O
! O
" O
" O
Why O
I O
had O
repeatedly O
before O
led O
her O
to O
infer O
that O
marriage O
was O
not O
my O
object O
. O
I O
never O
dreamed O
she O
could O
have O
been O
so O
foolish O
as O
to O
have O
mistaken O
me O
, O
little O
provoking O
romancer O
though O
she O
be O
! O
So O
I O
naturally O
wished O
her O
to O
know O
what O
a O
sacrifice O
of O
prejudice O
, O
of O
— O
of O
myself O
, O
in O
short O
, O
I O
was O
willing O
to O
make O
for O
her O
sake O

yet O
I O
don't O
think O
she O
was O
aware O
of O
it O
after O
all O
. O
I O
believe O
I O
might O
have O
any O
lady O
in O
Manchester S-GPE
if O
I O
liked O
, O
and O
yet O
I O
was O
willing O
and O
ready O
to O
marry O
a O
poor O
dress-maker O
. O
Don't O
you O
understand O
me O
now O
? O
and O
don't O
you O
see O
what O
a O
sacrifice O
I O
was O
making O
to O
humour O
her O
? O
and O
all O
to O
no O
avail O
. O
" O
Sally S-PERSON
was O
silent O
, O
so O
he O
went O
on O
: O
" O
My O

reminded O

rather O
maliciously O

" O

yes O

you O

her O
up O

the O

we O

sure O

note O

skilfully O
move O
away O

could O
not O
all O

making O
some O
sensation O
among O
the O

She O
was O
even O
forced O
to O
take O
several O
home O
with O
her O

But O
after O
reading O
one O

she O
determined O
on O
her O
plan O

She O
made O
no O
great O
resistance O
to O
receiving O
them O
from O
Sally S-PERSON

kept O
them O

occasionally O
returned O
them O
in O
a O
blank O
half O

sheet O
of O
paper O

But O
far O
worse O
than O
this O
, O
was O
the O
being O
so O
constantly O
waylaid O

she O
went O
home O

her O
persevering O

so O
long O
acquainted O

difficult O

Late O

early O

was O
never O
certain O

up O

all O
this O

Jem B-PERSON

never O
came O

Not O
to O

her O

to O

her O
father O

she O
did O
not O
know O
what O
, O
but O
she O
had O
hoped O
he O
would O
have O
come O
on O
some O
excuse O
, O
just O
to O
see O
if O
she O
hadn't O
changed O
her O
mind O

He O
never O
came O

Then O
she O
grew O
weary O
and O
impatient O
, O
and O
her O
spirits O
sank O
. O
The O
persecution O
of O
the O
one S-CARDINAL
lover O
, O
and O
the O
neglect O
of O
the O

her O
sorely O

could O
not O

quietly O

the O
evening O

by O

from O
pacing O
up O

down O

she O
felt O
as O
if O

must O
sing O
to O
keep O
off O
thought O
while O
she O
sewed O

And O
her O
songs O
were O
the O
maddest O

merriest O

she O
could O
think O
of O

" O
Barbara B-PERSON

" O
and O
such O
sorrowful O
ditties O
, O
did O
well O
enough O
for O
happy O
times O

but O
now O
she O
required O
all O
the O
aid O
that O
could O
be O
derived O
from O
external O
excitement O
to O
keep O
down O
the O
impulse O
of O
grief O
. O
And O
her O
father O
, O
too O
— O
he O
was O
a O
great O
anxiety O
to O
her O
, O
he O
looked O
so O
changed O

so O
ill O

he O
would O
not O

she O
never O
left O
off O

until O
( O
if O
the O
poor O
servants O
paid O
her O
pretty O
regularly O
for O
the O
odd O
jobs O

did O
for O

gave O
up O

savage O
hunger O

or O
the O
others O
, O
if O
it O
had O
not O
been O
for O
the O
sadness O
. O
" O
No O
letters O

" O
said O
Mrs. O
Wilson S-PERSON
. O
" O
No O
, O
none O
! O
I O
must O
just O
wait O
another O
day O

hear O
fra O
my O
lad O
. O
It's O
very O
dree O
work O
, O
waiting O
! O
" O
said O
Alice S-PERSON
. O
Margaret's S-PERSON
words O
came O
into O
Mary's S-PERSON
mind O
. O
Every O
one O
has O
their O
time O
and O
kind O
of O
waiting O
. O
" O
If O
I O
but O
knew O
he O
were O
safe O
, O
and O
not O
drowned O
! O
" O
spoke O
Alice S-PERSON
. O
" O
If O
I O
but O
knew O
he O
were O
drowned O
, O
I O
would O
ask O
grace O
to O
say O
, O
Thy O
will O
be O
done O
. O
It's O
the O
waiting O
. O
" O
" O
It's O
hard O
work O
to O
be O
patient O
to O
all O
of O
us O
, O
" O
said O
Mary S-PERSON
| | O
" O
I O
know O
I O
find O
it O
so O
, O
but O
I O
did O
not O
know O
one O
so O
good O
as O
you O
did O
, O
Alice S-PERSON
| | O
I O
shall O
not O
think O
so O
badly O
of O
myself O
for O
being O
a O
bit O
impatient O
, O
now O
I've O
heard O
you O
say O
you O
find O
it O
difficult O
. O
" O
The O
idea O
of O
reproach O
to O
Alice S-PERSON
was O
the O
last O
in O
Mary's S-PERSON
mind O
| | O
and O
Alice S-PERSON
knew O
it O
was O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
she O
said O
, O
" O
Then O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
I O
ask O
your O
pardon O
, O
and O
God's S-PERSON
pardon O
, O
too O
, O
if O
I've O
weakened O
your O
faith O
, O
by O
showing O
you O
how O
feeble O
mine O
was O
. O
Half S-CARDINAL
our O
life's O
spent O
in O
waiting O
, O
and O
it O
ill O
becomes O
one O
like O
me O
, O
wi O
' O
so O
many O
mercies O
, O
to O
grumble O
. O
I'll O
try O
and O
put O
a O
bridle O
o'er O
my O
tongue O
, O
and O
my O
thoughts O
too O
. O
" O
She O
spoke O
in O
a O
humble O
and O
gentle O
voice O
, O
like O
one O
asking O
forgiveness O
. O
" O
Come O
, O
Alice S-PERSON
, O
" O
interposed O
Mrs. O
Wilson S-PERSON
, O
" O
don't O
fret O
yoursel O
for O
e'er O
a O
trifle O
wrong O
said O
here O
or O
there O
. O
See O
! O
I've O
put O
th' O
kettle O
on O
, O
and O
you O
and O
Mary S-PERSON
shall O
ha O
' O
a O
dish O
o' O
tea O
in O
no O
time O
. O
" O
So O
she O
bustled O
about O
, O
and O
brought O
out O
a O
comfortable O
- O
looking O
substantial O
loaf O
, O
and O
set O
Mary S-PERSON
to O
cut O
bread O
and O
butter O
, O
while O
she O
rattled O
out O
the O
tea-cups O
— O
always O
a O
cheerful O
sound O
. O
Just O
as O
they O
were O
sitting O
down O
, O
there O
was O
a O
knock O
heard O
at O
the O
door O
, O
and O
without O
waiting O
for O
it O
to O
be O
opened O
from O
the O
inside O
, O
some O
one O
lifted O
the O
latch O
, O
and O
in O
a O
man's O
voice O
asked O
, O
if O
one O
George B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
lived O
there O
? O
Mrs. O
Wilson S-PERSON
was O
entering O
on O
a O
long O
and O
sorrowful O
explanation O
of O
his O
having O
once O
lived O
there O
, O
but O
of O
his O
having O
dropped O
down O
dead O
| | O
when O
Alice S-PERSON
, O
with O
the O
instinct O
of O
love O
( O
for O
in O
all O
usual O
and O
common O
instances O
, O
sight O
and O
hearing O
failed O
to O
convey O
impressions O
to O
her O
until O
long O
after O
other O
people O
had O
received O
them O
) O
, O
arose O
, O
and O
tottered O
to O
the O
door O
. O
" O
My O
bairn O
! O
— O
my O
own O
dear O
bairn O
! O
" O
she O
exclaimed O
, O
falling O
on O
Will O
Wilson's O
neck O
. O
You O
may O
fancy O
the O
hospitable O
and O
welcoming O
commotion O
that O
ensued O
| | O
how O
Mrs. O
Wilson S-PERSON
laughed O
, O
and O
talked O
, O
and O
cried O
, O
altogether O
, O
if O
such O
a O
thing O
can O
be O
done O
| | O
and O
how O
Mary S-PERSON
gazed O
with O
wondering O
pleasure O
at O
her O
old O
playmate O
| | O
now O
a O
dashing O
, O
bronzed O
- O
looking O
, O
ringletted O
sailor O
, O
frank O
, O
and O
hearty O
, O
and O
affectionate O
. O
But O
it O
was O
something O
different O
from O
common O
to O
see O
Alice's S-PERSON
joy O
at O
once O
more O
having O
her O
foster O
- O
child O
with O
her O
. O
She O
did O
not O
speak O
, O
for O
she O
really O
could O
not O
| | O
but O
the O
tears O
came O
coursing O
down O
her O
old O
withered O
cheeks O
, O
and O
dimmed O
the O
horn O
spectacles O
she O
had O
put O
on O
, O
in O
order O
to O
pry O
lovingly O
into O
his O
face O
. O
So O
what O
with O
her O
failing O
sight O
, O
and O
her O
tear O
- O
blinded O
eyes O
, O
she O
gave O
up O
the O
attempt O
of O
learning O
his O
face O
by O
heart O
through O
the O
medium O
of O
that O
sense O
, O
and O
tried O
another O
. O
She O
passed O
her O
sodden O
, O
shrivelled O
hands O
, O
all O
trembling O
with O
eagerness O
, O
over O
his O
manly O
face O
, O
bent O
meekly O
down O
in O
order O
that O
she O
might O
more O
easily O
make O
her O
strange O
inspection O
. O
At O
last O
, O
her O
soul O
was O
satisfied O
. O
After O
tea O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
feeling O
sure O
there O
was O
much O
to O
be O
said O
on O
both O
sides O
, O
at O
which O
it O
would O
be O
better O
no O
one O
should O
be O
present O
, O
not O
even O
an O
intimate O
friend O
like O
herself O
, O
got O
up O
to O
go O
away O
. O
This O
seemed O
to O
arouse O
Alice S-PERSON
from O
her O
dreamy O
consciousness O
of O
exceeding O
happiness O
, O
and O
she O
hastily O
followed O
Mary S-PERSON
to O
the O
door O
. O
There O
, O
standing O
outside O
, O
with O
the O
latch O
in O
her O
hand O
, O
she O
took O
hold O
of O
Mary's S-PERSON
arm O
, O
and O
spoke O
nearly O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
words O
she O
had O
uttered O
since O
her O
nephew's O
return O
. O
" O
My O
dear O
! O
I O
shall O
never O
forgive O

words O

block O
in O
your O
path O

how O
the O
Lord O

put O
coals O
of O
fire O
on O
my O
head O

! O

unbelieving O

weaken O
your O
faith O

CHAPTER O

A O
TRAVELLER'S O

" O
The O
mermaid O
sat O
upon O
the O

All O
day O
long O
, O
Admiring O
her O
beauty O

combing O

four B-DATE

five I-DATE

after O
the O
events O
mentioned O
in O
the O
last O

that O
one O
evening O
, O
as O
Mary S-PERSON
stood O
lost O
in O
reverie O
at O
the O
window O
, O
she O
saw O
Will B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
enter O
the O
court O
, O
and O
come O
quickly O
up O
to O
her O
door O
. O
She O
was O
glad O
to O
see O
him O
, O
for O
he O
had O
always O
been O
a O
friend O
of O
hers O
, O
perhaps O
too O
much O
like O
her O
in O
character O
ever O
to O
become O
any O
thing O
nearer O
or O
dearer O
. O
She O
opened O
the O
door O
in O
readiness O
to O
receive O
his O
frank O
greeting O
, O
which O
she O
as O
frankly O
returned O
. O
" O
Come O

Mary S-PERSON
! O
on O

asked O
Mary S-PERSON

as O
her O
heart O
leaped O
up O
at O
the O
thought O
of O
who O
might O
be O
waiting O
for O
her O

" O
Not O
very O
far O

" O
Only O
to O
old O
Job B-PERSON

it's O
time O

Yes O

his O

tongue O

likes O

him O

still O

gloomy O

craze O
a O
man O

certainly O

such O
a O
noisy O
black O
hole O

were O
one S-CARDINAL

two S-CARDINAL

worth O
looking O
at O

the O
bellows O
for O

the O
gale O

called O

I O
could O
ha O
' O
stood O
near O
it O
a O
whole O
day O

if O
I'd O
a O

it O
blew O
my O
hat O
out O
o' O
my O

He's O
lost O
all O

frets O
my O

sadly O

would O

a O
blank O

she O
soon O

all O

Margaret S-PERSON
, O
who O
could O
not O

idle O

was O
knitting O
away O

with O
her O
face O

full O
into O
the O

away O

Alice S-PERSON
sat O

gentle O
look O

trying O
to O
see O

hear O

never O
complaining O

indeed O
, O
in O
her O
inner O
self O
she O
was O
blessing O
God O
for O
her O
happiness O

the O
joy O
of O
having O
her O

her O
child O
, O
near O
her O
, O
was O
far O
more O
present O
to O

than O
her O
deprivations O

Job O
was O
in O
the O
full O
glory O
of O
host O

hostess O
too O
, O
for O
by O
a O
tacit O
agreement O
he O
had O
roused O
himself O
from O
his O
habitual O
abstraction O
, O
and O
had O
assumed O
many O
of O
Margaret's S-ORG
little O
household O
duties O
. O
While O
he O
moved O
about O
he O
was O
deep O
in O
conversation O
with O
the O
young O
sailor O
, O
trying O
to O
extract O
from O
him O
any O

connected O

Pooh O

naturalist O

Both O
speeches O
determined O
Will S-PERSON
to O
go O
on O
with O
his O
story O

What O
could O
a O
fellow O
who O
had O
never O
been O
many O
miles O
from O
home O
know O
about O
the O
wonders O

the O
deep O
, O
that O
he O
should O
put O
him O
down O
in O
that O
way O
? O
" O
Well O
, O
it O
were O
Jack B-PERSON
Harris E-PERSON
, O
our O
third S-ORDINAL
mate O
last O
voyage O
, O
as O
many O
and O
many O
a O
time O
telled O
us O
all O
about O
it O
. O
You O
see O
he O
were O
becalmed O
off O
Chatham B-LOC
Island E-LOC
( O
that's O
in O
the B-LOC
Great I-LOC

, O
and O

warm O
enough O
latitude O
for O
mermaids O

sharks O
, O
and O
such O
like O
perils O
) O
. O
So O
some O
of O
the O
men O
took O
the O
long O
boat O
, O
and O
pulled O
for O
the O
island O
to O
see O
what O
it O
were O
like O

and O
when O
they O
got O
near O
, O
they O
heard O
a O
puffing O
, O
like O
a O
creature O
come O
up O
to O
take O
breath O

you've O
never O
heard O
a O

No O
! O

! O
you've O
heard O
folks O
in O
th' O
asthma O
, O
and O
it O
were O
for O
all O
the O
world O

So O
they O
looked O
around O
, O
and O
what O
should O
they O
see O
but O
a O
mermaid O
, O
sitting O
on O
a O
rock O
, O
and O
sunning O
herself O
. O
The O
water O
is O
always O
warmer O
when O
it's O
rough O
, O
you O
know O
, O
so O
I O
suppose O
in O
the O
calm O
she O
felt O
it O
rather O
chilly O
, O
and O
had O
come O
up O
to O
warm O
herself O
. O
" O
" O
What O
was O
she O
like O
? O
" O
asked O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
breathlessly O
. O
Job O
took O
his O
pipe O
off O
the O
chimney O
- O
piece O
and O
began O
to O
smoke O
with O
very O
audible O
puffs O
, O
as O
if O
the O
story O
were O
not O
worth O
listening O
to O
. O
" O
Oh O
! O
Jack S-PERSON
used O
to O
say O
she O
was O
for O
all O
the O
world O
as O
beautiful O
as O
any O
of O
the O
wax O
ladies O
in O
the O
barbers' O
shops O

only O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
there O
were O
one S-CARDINAL
little O
difference O
: O
her O
hair O
was O
bright O
grass O
green O
. O
" O
" O
I O
should O
not O
think O
that O
was O
pretty O
, O
" O
said O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
hesitatingly O

as O
if O

doubt O
the O
perfection O

acknowledged O
beauty O

" O
Oh O
! O
but O
it O
is O
when O
you're O
used O
to O
it O

I O
always O
think O
when O
first S-ORDINAL
we O
get O
sight O
of O
land O
, O
there's O
no O
colour O
so O
lovely O
as O
grass O
green O
. O
However O
, O
she O
had O
green O
hair O
sure O
enough O

and O
were O
proud O
enough O
of O
it O
, O
too O

for O
she O
were O
combing O
it O
out O
full O

length O
when O
first O
they O
saw O
her O

They O
all O
thought O
she O
were O
a O
fair O
prize O
, O
and O
may O
be O
as O
good O
as O
a O
whale O
in O
ready O
money O
( O
they O
were O
whale O

fishers O
you O
know O

For O
some O
folk O
think O
a O
deal O
of O
mermaids O

whatever O
other O
folk O
do O

" O
This O
was O
a O
hit O
at O
Job S-ORG

who O
retaliated O
in O
a O
series O
of O
sonorous O
spittings O
and O
puffs O

" O
So O
, O
as O
I O
were O
saying O

they O
pulled O
towards O
her O

were O
all O

how O

feared O

What O
could O
he O
do O
for O
him O
? O
He O
could O
ask O
Margaret S-PERSON
to O
sing O
. O
Other O
folks O
beside O
her O
old O
doating O
grandfather O
thought O
a O
deal O
of O
her O
songs O
. O
So O
Margaret S-PERSON
began O
some O
of O
her O
noble O
old O

fashioned O
songs O

her O

she O
poured O
her O
rich O
voice O
out O
in O
some O
of O
the O
old O
canzonets O
she O
had O
lately O
learnt O
while O
accompanying O
the O
musical O
lecturer O
on O
his O
tour O

Mary S-PERSON

amused O

His O
very O
lids O
refused O
to O
wink O
, O
as O
if O
afraid O
in O
that O
brief O
proverbial O
interval O
to O
lose O
a O
particle O
of O
the O
rich O
music O
that O
floated O
through O
the O
room O

For O
the O
first S-ORDINAL

the O

little O
sensible O
Margaret S-PERSON

opinion O

new O

The O
flying O
fish O
went O
a O
great O
way O
, O
and O
his O
undisguised O
admiration O
for O
Margaret's S-PERSON
singing O
carried O
him O
still O
further O

It O
was O
amusing O
enough O
to O

after O
Margaret's S-PERSON
song O

sidled O
up O
to O
Job O

asked O
him O
in O
a O
sort O
of O
doubting O
tone O

" O

" O
Mary S-PERSON
did O
not O
understand O
, O
so O
she O
left O
him O
and O
went O
to O
sit O
by O
Alice S-PERSON
, O
who O
could O
not O
hear O
conversation O
unless O
expressly O
addressed O
to O

She O
had O
sat O
patiently O
silent O
the O
greater O
part O
of O
the O
night O
, O
and O
now O
greeted O
Mary S-PERSON
with O
a O
quiet O
smile O
. O
" O
Where's O
yo'r O
father O
? O
" O
asked O
she O
. O
" O
I O
guess O
he's O
at O
his O
Union S-ORG

he's O
there O
most O

Alice S-PERSON
shook O
her O
head O

but O
whether O
it O
were O
that O
she O
did O
not O
hear O

that O
she O
did O
not O
quite O
approve O
of O
what O
she O
heard O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
could O
not O
make O
out O
. O
She O
sat O
silently O
watching O
Alice S-PERSON
, O
and O
regretting O
over O
her O
dimmed O
and O
veiled O
eyes O
, O
formerly O
so O
bright O
and O
speaking O

as O
if O
Alice S-PERSON
understood O
by O
some O
other O
sense O
what O
was O
passing O
in O
Mary's S-PERSON
mind O
, O
she O
turned O
suddenly O
round O
, O
and O
answered O
Mary's S-PERSON
thought O
. O
" O
Yo're O
mourning O
for O
me O
, O
my O
dear O

and O
there's O
no O

, O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
I'm O
as O
happy O
as O
a O
child O

I O
sometimes O
think O
I O
am O
a O
child O

whom O
the O
Lord O
is O
hushabying O
to O
my O

For O
when O
I O
were O
a O
nurse O
- O
girl O
, O
my O
missis O
alway O
telled O
me O
to O
speak O
very O
soft O
and O
low O
, O
and O
to O
darken O
the O
room O
that O
her O
little O
one O
might O
go O
to O
sleep O

and O
now O
all O
noises O
are O
hushed O
and O
still O
to O
me O
, O
and O
the O
bonny O
earth O
seems O
dim O

dark O

I O
know O
it's O
my O
Father O
lulling O
me O
away O

very O
well O
content O

mustn't O

Mary S-PERSON

of O
Alice's S-PERSON
long O

cherished O
, O
fond O
wish O
to O

the O
home O

her O
childhood O
, O
so O
often O

often O
deferred O
, O
and O
now O
probably O
never O

take O
place O

Or O
if O
it O

how O
changed O
from O
the O
fond O
anticipation O
of O
what O
it O

It O
would O
be O
a O
mockery O
to O

deaf O
Alice S-PERSON

The O
evening O
came O
quickly O
to O
an O
end O

There O
was O
the O
humble O
cheerful O
meal O
, O
and O
then O
the O
bustling O
merry O
farewell O
, O
and O
Mary S-PERSON
was O
once O
more O
in O
the O
quietness O
and O
solitude O
of O
her O
own O
dingy O
, O
dreary O
- O
looking O
home O

her O
father O
still O
out O

her O
evening's O
task O
of O
work O
lying O
all O
undone O
upon O
the O
dresser O

But O
it O
had O
been O
a O
pleasant O
little O
interlude O
to O
think O
upon O

It O
had O
distracted O
her O
attention O
for O

from O
the O
pressure O

of O
the O
dark O

heavy O
, O
oppressive O
times O

surround O
her O
on O

of O
her O
father O

up O

down O

in O

for O
her O

wonderful O
perseverance O

of O

made O
himself O

worse O

they O
reach O
Jem B-PERSON

And O
all O
this O
she O
had O
drawn O
upon O
herself O
by O
her O
giddy O
flirting O
. O
Oh O
! O
how O
she O
loathed O
the O
recollection O
of O
the O
hot O
summer O
evening O

when O
, O
worn O
out O

loitered O
homewards O

weary O

first S-ORDINAL

heart O
sank O
within O

at O
the O
remembrance O

most O

to O

even O

had O
sense O

is O
the O
leper O

counted O
unclean O

In O
her O
wild O
night O

little O
thought O
of O

You O
may O
easily O
imagine O

considered O
hardly O

worked O

monotonous O

which O
now O
in O
retrospection O
seemed O

Accordingly O

she O

, O
as O
we O

known O
where O
to O
meet O

John B-PERSON

a O

him O
walking O
and O
talking O
with O
both O
father O
and O
son O
| | O
her O
old O
friends O
too O
| | O
and O
she O
had O
shed O
unregarded O
, O
unvalued O
tears O
, O
when O
some O
one O
had O
casually O
told O
her O
of O
George B-PERSON
Wilson's E-PERSON
sudden O
death O
. O
It O
now O
flashed O
across O
her O
mind O
, O
that O
to O
the O
son O
, O
to O
Mary's S-PERSON
play O
- O
fellow O
, O
her O
elder O
brother O
in O
the O
days O
of O
childhood O
, O
her O
tale O
might O
be O
told O
, O
and O
listened O
to O
with O
interest O
, O
and O
some O
mode O
of O
action O
suggested O
by O
him O
by O
which O
Mary S-PERSON
might O
be O
guarded O
and O
saved O
. O
All O
these O
thoughts O
had O
passed O
through O
her O
mind O
while O
yet O
she O
was O
in O
prison O
| | O
so O
when O
she O
was O
turned O
out O
, O
her O
purpose O
was O
clear O
, O
and O
she O
did O
not O
feel O
her O
desolation O
of O
freedom O
as O
she O
would O
otherwise O
have O
done O
. O
That O
night O
she O
stationed O
herself O
early O
near O
the O
foundry O
where O
she O
knew O
Jem S-PERSON
worked O
| | O
he O
stayed O
later O
than O
usual O
, O
being O
detained O
by O
some O
arrangements O
for O
the O
morrow O
. O
She O
grew O
tired O
and O
impatient O
| | O
many O
workmen O
had O
come O
out O
of O
the O
door O
in O
the O
long O
, O
dead O
, O
brick O
wall O
, O
and O
eagerly O
had O
she O
peered O
into O
their O
faces O
, O
deaf O
to O
all O
insult O
or O
curse O
. O
He O
must O
have O
gone O
home O
early O
| | O
one S-CARDINAL
more O
turn O
in O
the O
street O
, O
and O
she O
would O
go O
. O
During O
that O
turn O
he O
came O
out O
, O
and O
in O
the O
quiet O
of O
that O
street O
of O
workshops O
and O
warehouses O
, O
she O
directly O
heard O
his O
steps O
. O
Now O
her O
heart O
failed O
her O
for O
an O
instant O
| | O
but O
still O
she O
was O
not O
daunted O
from O
her O
purpose O
, O
painful O
as O
its O
fulfilment O
was O
sure O
to O
be O
. O
She O
laid O
her O
hand O
on O
his O
arm O
. O
As O
she O
expected O
, O
after O
a O
momentary O
glance O
at O
the O
person O
who O
thus O
endeavoured O
to O
detain O
him O
, O
he O
made O
an O
effort O
to O
shake O
it O
off O
, O
and O
pass O
on O
. O
But O
trembling O
as O
she O
was O
, O
she O
had O
provided O
against O
this O
by O
a O
firm O
and O
unusual O
grasp O
. O
" O
You O
must O
listen O
to O
me O
, O
Jem B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
, O
" O
she O
said O
, O
with O
almost O
an O
accent O
of O
command O
. O
" O
Go O
away O
, O
missis O
| | O
I've O
nought O
to O
do O
with O
you O
, O
either O
in O
hearkening O
, O
or O
talking O
. O
" O
He O
made O
another O
struggle O
. O
" O
You O
must O
listen O
, O
" O
she O
said O
again O
, O
authoritatively O
, O
" O
for O
Mary B-PERSON
Barton's E-PERSON
sake O
. O
" O
The O
spell O
of O
her O
name O
was O
as O
potent O
as O
that O
of O
the O
mariner's O
glittering O
eye O
. O
" O
He O
listened O
like O
a O
three B-DATE
- I-DATE
year E-DATE
child O
. O
" O
" O
I O
know O
you O
care O
enough O
for O
her O
to O
wish O
to O
save O
her O
from O
harm O
. O
" O
He O
interrupted O
his O
earnest O
gaze O
into O
her O
face O
, O
with O
the O
exclamation O
— O
" O
And O
who O
can O
yo O
be O
to O
know O
Mary B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
, O
or O
to O
know O
that O
she's O
ought O
to O
me O
? O
" O
There O
was O
a O
little O
strife O
in O
Esther's S-PERSON
mind O
for O
an O
instant O
, O
between O
the O
shame O
of O
acknowledging O
herself O
, O
and O
the O
additional O
weight O
to O
her O
revelation O
which O
such O
acknowledgment O
would O
give O
. O
Then O
she O
spoke O
. O
" O
Do O
you O
remember O
Esther S-PERSON
, O
the O
sister O
of O
John B-PERSON
Barton's E-PERSON
wife O
? O
the O
aunt O
to O
Mary S-PERSON

And O
the O
Valentine S-PERSON
I O
sent O
you O
last B-DATE

? O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
I O
mind O
her O
well O
! O
But O
yo O
are O
not O
Esther S-PERSON
, O
are O
you O
? O
" O
He O
looked O
again O
into O
her O
face O
, O
and O
seeing O
that O
indeed O
it O
was O
his O
boyhood's O
friend O
, O
he O
took O
her O
hand O
, O
and O
shook O
it O
with O
a O
cordiality O
that O
forgot O
the O
present O
in O
the O
past O
. O
" O
Why O
, O
Esther S-PERSON
! O
Where O
han O
ye O
been O
this O
many O
a O
year O
? O
Where O
han O
ye O
been O
wandering O
that O
we O
none O
of O
us O
could O
find O
you O
out O
? O
" O
The O
question O
was O
asked O
thoughtlessly O
, O
but O
answered O
with O
fierce O
earnestness O
. O
" O
Where O
have O
I O
been O
? O
What O
have O
I O
been O
doing O
? O
Why O
do O
you O
torment O
me O
with O
questions O
like O
these O
? O
Can O
you O
not O
guess O
? O
But O
the O
story O
of O
my O
life O
is O
wanted O
to O
give O
force O
to O
my O
speech O
, O
afterwards O
I O
will O
tell O
it O
you O
. O
Nay O
! O
don't O
change O
your O
fickle O
mind O
now O
, O
and O
say O
you O
don't O
want O
to O
hear O
it O
. O
You O
must O
hear O
it O
, O
and O
I O
must O
tell O
it O

and O
then O
see O
after O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
and O
take O
care O
she O
does O
not O
become O
like O
me O
. O
As O
she O
is O
loving O
now O
, O
so O
did O
I O
love O
once O
| | O
one O
above O
me O
far O
. O
" O
She O
remarked O
not O
, O
in O
her O
own O
absorption O
, O
the O
change O
in O
Jem's O
breathing O
, O
the O
sudden O
clutch O
at O
the O
wall O
which O
told O
the O
fearfully O
vivid O
interest O
he O
took O
in O
what O
she O
said O
. O
" O
He O
was O
so O
handsome O
, O
so O
kind O
! O
Well O
, O
the O
regiment O
was O
ordered O
to O
Chester S-PERSON
( O
did O
I O
tell O
you O
he O
was O
an O
officer O
? O
) O
, O
and O
he O
could O
not O
bear O
to O
part O
from O
me O
, O
nor O
I O
from O
him O
, O
so O
he O
took O
me O
with O
him O
. O
I O
never O
thought O
poor O
Mary S-PERSON
would O
have O
taken O
it O
so O
to O
heart O
! O
I O
always O
meant O
to O
send O
for O
her O
to O
pay O
me O
a O
visit O
when O
I O
was O
married O

for O
, O
mark O
you O
! O
he O
promised O
me O
marriage O
. O
They O
all O
do O
. O
Then O
came O
three B-DATE
years E-DATE
of O
happiness O
. O
I O
suppose O
I O
ought O
not O
to O
have O
been O
happy O
, O
but O
I O
was O
. O
I O
had O
a O
little O
girl O
, O
too O
. O
Oh O
! O
the O
sweetest O
darling O
that O
ever O
was O
seen O
! O
But O
I O
must O
not O
think O
of O
her O
, O
" O
putting O
her O
hand O
wildly O
up O
to O
her O
forehead O
, O
" O
or O
I O
shall O
go O
mad O

I O
shall O

" O
" O
Don't S-PERSON
tell O
me O
any O
more O
about O
yoursel O
, O
" O
said O
Jem S-PERSON
, O
soothingly O
. O
" O
What O
! O
you're O
tired O
already O
, O
are O
you O
? O
but O
I'll S-PERSON
tell O
you O

as O
you've O
asked O
for O
it O
, O
you O
shall O
hear O
it O

I O
won't O
recall O
the O
agony O
of O
the O
past O
for O
nothing O
. O
I O
will O
have O
the O
relief O
of O
telling O
it O
. O
Oh O
, O
how O
happy O
I O
was O
! O
" O
— O
sinking O
her O
voice O
into O
a O
plaintive O
child O
- O
like O
manner O
. O
" O
It O
came O
like O
a O
shot O
on O
me O
when O
one O
day O
he O
came O
to O
me O
and O
told O
me O
he O
was O
ordered O
to O
Ireland S-GPE
, O
and O
must O
leave O
me O
behind O

at O
Bristol S-GPE
we O
then O
were O
. O
" O
Jem S-PERSON
muttered O
some O
words O
| | O
she O
caught O
their O
meaning O
, O
and O
in O
a O
pleading O
voice O
continued O
, O
" O
Oh O
, O
don't O
abuse O
him O

don't O
speak O
a O
word O
against O
him O

You O

him O
yet O

yet O
, O
when O
I O
am O
sunk O
so O
low O
. O
You O
don't O
guess O
how O
kind O
he O
was O
. O
He O
gave O
me O
fifty B-QUANTITY
pound E-QUANTITY
before O
we O
parted O
, O
and O
I O
knew O
he O
could O
ill O
spare O
it O

Don't S-PERSON
, O
Jem S-PERSON
, O
please O
, O
" O
as O
his O
muttered O
indignation O
rose O
again O
. O
For O
her O
sake O
he O
ceased O
. O
" O
I O
might O
have O
done O
better O
with O
the O
money O

I O
see O
now O
. O
But O
I O
did O
not O
know O
the O
value O
of O
money O
. O
Formerly O
I O
had O
earned O
it O
easily O
enough O
at O
the O
factory O
, O
and O
as O
I O
had O
no O
more O
sensible O
wants O
, O
I O
spent O
it O
on O
dress O
and O
on O
eating O
. O
While O
I O
lived O
with O
him O
, O
I O
had O
it O
for O
asking O

and O
fifty B-QUANTITY
pounds E-QUANTITY
would O
, O
I O
thought O
, O
go O
a O
long O
way O
. O
So O
I O
went O
back O
to O
Chester S-GPE
, O
where O
I'd O
been O
so O
happy O
, O
and O
set O
up O
a O
small O
- O
ware O
shop O
, O
and O
hired O
a O
room O
near O
. O
We O
should O
have O
done O
well O
, O
but O
alas O
! O
alas O
! O
my O
little O
girl O
fell O
ill O
, O
and O
I O
could O
not O
mind O
my O
shop O
and O
her O
too O
| | O
and O
things O
grew O
worse O
and O
worse O
. O
I O
sold O
my O
goods O
any O
how O
to O
get O
money O
to O
buy O
her O
food O
and O
medicine O

I O
wrote O
over O
and O
over O
again O
to O
her O
father O
for O
help O
, O
but O
he O
must O
have O
changed O
his O
quarters O
, O
for O
I O
never O
got O
an O
answer O
. O
The O
landlord O
seized O
the O
few O
bobbins O
and O
tapes O
I O
had O
left O
, O
for O
shop O
- O
rent O

and O
the O
person O
to O
whom O
the O
mean O
little O
room O

to O
which O
we O
had O
been O
forced O
to O
remove O

threatened O
to O
turn O
us O
out O
unless O
his O
rent O
was O
paid O

it O
had O
run O
on O
many B-DATE
weeks E-DATE
, O
and O
it O
was O
winter O
, O
cold O
bleak O
winter O

and O
my O
child O
was O
so O
ill O
, O
so O
ill O
, O
and O
I O
was O
starving O
. O
And O
I O
could O
not O
bear O
to O
see O
her O
suffer O
, O
and O
forgot O
how O
much O
better O
it O
would O
be O
for O
us O
to O
die O
together O

— O
oh O
her O
moans O
, O
her O
moans O
, O
which O
money O
would O
give O
me O
the O
means O
of O
relieving O
! O
So O
I O
went O
out O
into O
the O
street O
, O
one B-TIME
January I-TIME
night E-TIME
— O
Do O
you O
think O
God O
will O
punish O
me O
for O
that O
? O
" O
she O
asked O
with O
wild O
vehemence O
, O
almost O
amounting O
to O
insanity O
, O
and O
shaking O
Jem's S-PERSON
arm O
in O
order O
to O
force O
an O
answer O
from O
him O
. O
But O
before O
he O
could O
shape O
his O
heart's O
sympathy O
into O
words O
, O
her O
voice O
had O
lost O
its O
wildness O
, O
and O
she O
spoke O
with O
the O
quiet O
of O
despair O
. O
" O
But O
it's O
no O
matter O
! O
I've O
done O
that O
since O
, O
which O
separates O
us O
as O
far O
asunder O
as O
heaven O
and O
hell O
can O
be O
. O
" O
Her O
voice O
rose O
again O
to O
the O
sharp O
pitch O
of O
agony O
. O
" O
My O
darling O
! O
my O
darling O
! O
even O
after O
death O

thee O

my O
own O
sweet O
one O

She O
was O
so O
good O
— O
like O
a O
little O
angel O
. O
What O
is O
that O
text O
, O
I O
don't O
remember O
, O
— O
that O
text O
mother O
used O
to O
teach O
me O
when O
I O
sat O
on O
her O
knee O
long O
ago O

it O
begins O
, O
' O
Blessed O
are O
the O
pure O
' O
" O
— O
" O
Blessed O
are O
the O
pure O
in O
heart O
, O
for O
they O
shall O
see O
God O
. O
" O
" O
Ay O
, O
that's O
it O
! O
It O
would O
break O
mother's O
heart O
if O
she O
knew O
what O
I O
am O
now O
— O
it O
did O
break O
Mary's O
heart O
, O
you O
see O
. O
And O
now O
I O
recollect O
it O
was O
about O
her O
child O
I O
wanted O
so O
to O
see O
you O
, O
Jem S-PERSON
. O
You O
know O
Mary B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
, O
don't O
you O
? O
" O
said O
she O
, O
trying O
to O
collect O
her O
thoughts O
. O
Yes O
, O
Jem S-PERSON
knew O
her O
. O
How O
well O
, O
his O
beating O
heart O
could O
testify O
! O
" O
Well O
, O
there's O
something O
to O
do O
for O
her O
| | O
I O
forget O
what O
| | O
wait O
a O
minute O
! O
She O
is O
so O
like O
my O
little O
girl O
| | O
" O
said O
she O
, O
raising O
her O
eyes O
, O
glistening O
with O
unshed O
tears O
, O
in O
search O
of O
the O
sympathy O
of O
Jem's S-PERSON
countenance O
. O
He O
deeply O
pitied O
her O
| | O
but O
oh O
! O
how O
he O
longed O
to O
recall O
her O
mind O
to O
the O
subject O
of O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
and O
the O
lover O
above O
her O
in O
rank O
, O
and O
the O
service O
to O
be O
done O
for O
her O
sake O
. O
But O
he O
controlled O
himself O
to O
silence O
. O
After O
awhile O
, O
she O
spoke O
again O
, O
and O
in O
a O
calmer O
voice O
. O
" O
When O
I O
came O
to O
Manchester S-GPE
( O
for O
I O
could O
not O
stay O
in O
Chester S-GPE
after O
her O
death O
) O
, O
I O
found O
you O
all O
out O
very O
soon O
. O
And O
yet O
I O
never O
thought O
my O
poor O
sister O
was O
dead O
. O
I O
suppose O
I O
would O
not O
think O
so O
. O
I O
used O
to O
watch O
about O
the O
court O
where O
John S-PERSON
lived O
, O
for O
many O
and O
many O
a O
night O
, O
and O
gather O
all O
I O
could O
about O
them O
from O
the O
neighbours' O
talk O
| | O
for O
I O
never O
asked O
a O
question O
. O
I O
put O
this O
and O
that O
together O
, O
and O
followed O
one O
, O
and O
listened O
to O
the O
other O
| | O
many's O
the O
time O
I've O
watched O
the O
policeman O
off O
his O
beat O
, O
and O
peeped O
through O
the O
chink O
of O
the O
window O
- O
shutter O
to O
see O
the O
old O
room O
, O
and O
sometimes O
Mary S-PERSON
or O
her O
father O
sitting O
up O
late O
for O
some O
reason O
or O
another O
. O
I O
found O
out O
Mary S-PERSON
went O
to O
learn O
dress-making O
, O
and O
I O
began O
to O
be O
frightened O
for O
her O
| | O
for O
it's O
a O
bad O
life O
for O
a O
girl O
to O
be O
out O
late B-TIME
at I-TIME
night E-TIME
in O
the O
streets O
, O
and O
after O
many B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour E-TIME
of O
weary O
work O
, O
they're O
ready O
to O
follow O
after O
any O
novelty O
that O
makes O
a O
little O
change O
. O
But O
I O
made O
up O
my O
mind O
, O
that O
bad O
as O
I O
was O
, O
I O
could O
watch O
over O
Mary S-PERSON
and O
perhaps O
keep O
her O
from O
harm O
. O
So O
I O
used O
to O
wait O
for O
her O
at O
nights O
, O
and O
follow O
her O
home O
, O
often O
when O
she O
little O
knew O
any O
one O
was O
near O
her O
. O
There O
was O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
her O
companions O
I O
never O
could O
abide O
, O
and O
I'm O
sure O
that O
girl O
is O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
some O
mischief O
. O
By O
- O
and O
- O
bye O
, O
Mary's S-PERSON
walks O
homewards O
were O
not O
alone O
. O
She O
was O
joined O
soon O
after O
she O
came O
out O
, O
by O
a O
man O
| | O
a O
gentleman O
. O
I O
began O
to O
fear O
for O
her O
, O
for O
I O
saw O
she O
was O
light O
- O
hearted O
, O
and O
pleased O
with O
his O
attentions O
| | O
and O
I O
thought O
worse O
of O
him O
for O
having O
such O
long O
talks O
with O
that O
bold O
girl O
I O
told O
you O
of O
. O
But O
I O
was O
laid O
up O
for O
a O
long O
time O
with O
spitting O
of O
blood O
| | O
and O
could O
do O
nothing O
. O
I'm O
sure O
it O
made O
me O
worse O
, O
thinking O
about O
what O
might O
be O
happening O
to O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
And O
when O
I O
came O
out O
, O
all O
was O
going O
on O
as O
before O
, O
only O
she O
seemed O
fonder O
of O
him O
than O
ever O
| | O
and O
oh O
Jem S-PERSON
! O
her O
father O
won't O
listen O
to O
me O
, O
and O
it's O
you O
must O
save O
Mary S-PERSON
! O
You're O
like O
a O
brother O
to O
her O
, O
and O
maybe O
could O
give O
her O
advice O
and O
watch O
over O
her O
, O
and O
at O
any O
rate O
John S-PERSON
will O
hearken O
to O
you O
| | O
only O
he's O
so O
stern O
and O
so O
cruel O
. O
" O
She O
began O
to O
cry O
a O
little O
at O
the O
remembrance O
of O
his O
harsh O
words O
| | O
but O
Jem S-PERSON
cut O
her O
short O
by O
his O
hoarse O
, O
stern O
inquiry O
, O
" O
Who O
is O
this O
spark O
that O
Mary S-PERSON
loves O
? O
Tell O
me O
his O
name O
! O
" O
" O
It's O
young O
Carson S-PERSON
, O
old O
Carson's S-PERSON
son O
, O
that O
your O
father O
worked O
for O
. O
" O
There O
was O
a O
pause O
. O
She O
broke O
the O
silence O
. O
" O
Oh O
! O
Jem S-PERSON
, O
I O
charge O
you O
with O
the O
care O
of O
her O
! O
I O
suppose O
it O
would O
be O
murder O
to O
kill O
her O
, O
but O
it O
would O
be O
better O
for O
her O
to O
die O
than O
to O
live O
to O
lead O
such O
a O
life O
as O
I O
do O
. O
Do O
you O
hear O
me O
, O
Jem S-PERSON
? O
" O
" O
Yes O
! O
I O
hear O
you O
. O
It O
would O
be O
better O
. O
Better O
we O
were O
all O
dead O
. O
" O
This O
was O
said O
as O
if O
thinking O
aloud O

but O
he O
immediately O
changed O
his O
tone O
, O
and O
continued O
, O
" O
Esther S-PERSON

you O
may O
trust O
to O
my O
doing O
all O
I O
can O
for O
Mary S-PERSON

That O
I O
have O
determined O
on O
. O
And O
now O
listen O
to O
me O
! O
you O
loathe O
the O
life O

else O
you O

my O
mother O

She O

Come O
home O

me O

" O
She O
was O
silent O
for O
a B-TIME
minute E-TIME
, O
and O
he O
hoped O
he O
had O
gained O
his O
point O
. O
Then O
she O
said O
, O
" O
God O
bless O
you O

she O
added O

with O
accents O
of O
deep O
despair O

he O
did O
not O
relax O

round O

With O
heart O

soul O

in O
few O
words O

promised O

come O
at O
night O
, O
and O
look O
at O
the O
corners O
of O
the O
streets O
about O
here O
. O
The O
colder O
, O
the O
bleaker O
, O
the O
more O
stormy O
the O
night O
, O
the O
more O
certain O
you O
will O
be O
to O
find O
me O
. O
For O
then O
, O
" O
she O
added O
, O
with O
a O
plaintive O
fall O
in O
her O
voice O
, O
" O
it O
is O
so O
cold O
sleeping O
in O
entries O
, O

on O
door O

steps O
, O

I O
want O
a O
dram O
more O
than O
ever O
. O
" O
Again O
she O
rapidly O
turned O
off O
, O
and O
Jem S-PERSON
also O
went O
on O
his O
way O
. O
But O
before O
he O
reached O
the O
end O
of O
the O
street O
, O
even O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
the O
jealous O
anguish O
that O
filled O
his O
heart O
, O
his O
conscience O
smote O
him O
. O
He O
had O
not O
done O
enough O
to O
save O
her O
. O
One S-CARDINAL
more O
effort O
, O
and O
she O
might O
have O
come O
. O
Nay S-PERSON
, O
twenty S-CARDINAL
efforts O
would O
have O
been O
well O
rewarded O
by O
her O
yielding O
. O
He O
turned O
back O
, O
but O
she O
was O
gone O
. O
In O
the O
tumult O
of O
his O
other O
feelings O
, O
his O
self O
- O
reproach O
was O
deadened O
for O
the O
time O
. O
But O
many O
and O
many O
a O
day O
afterwards O
he O
bitterly O
regretted O
his O
omission O
of O
duty O
| | O
his O
weariness O
of O
well O
- O
doing O
. O
Now O
, O
the O
great O
thing O
was O
to O
reach O
home O
, O
and O
solitude O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
loved O
another O
! O
Oh O
! O
how O
should O
he O
bear O
it O
? O
He O
had O
thought O
her O
rejection O
of O
him O
a O
hard O
trial O
, O
but O
that O
was O
nothing O
now O
. O
He O
only O
remembered O
it O
, O
to O
be O
thankful O
he O
had O
not O
yielded O
to O
the O
temptation O
of O
trying O
his O
fate O
again O
, O
not O
in O
actual O
words O
, O
but O
in O
a O
meeting O
, O
where O
her O
manner O
should O
tell O
far O
more O
than O
words O
, O
that O
her O
sweeter O
smiles O
, O
her O
dainty O
movements O
, O
her O
pretty O
household O
ways O
, O
were O
all O
to O
be O
reserved O
to O
gladden O
another's O
eyes O

heart O
. O
And O
he O
must O
live O
on O

that O
seemed O
the O
strangest O
. O
That O
a O
long O
life O

men O

live O
long O

even O
with O
deep O
, O
biting O
sorrow O
corroding O
at O
their O
hearts O

spent O
without O

nay O
, O
with O
the O
consciousness O
she O
was O
another's O
! O
That O
hell O
of O
thought O
he O
would O
reserve O
for O
the O
quiet O
of O
his O
own O
room O
, O
the O
dead O
stillness O
of O
night O

He O
was O
on O

home O

entered O

There O
were O
the O
usual O
faces O
, O
the O
usual O
sights O
. O
He O
loathed O
them O
, O
and O
then O
he O
cursed O
himself O
because O
he O
loathed O
them O
. O
His O
mother's O
love O
had O
taken O
a O
cross O
turn O
, O
because O
he O
had O
kept O
the O
tempting O
supper O

had O
prepared O
for O
him O
waiting O
until O
it O
was O
nearly O
spoilt O
. O
Alice S-PERSON
, O
her O
dulled O
senses O
deadening O
day O
by O
day O
, O
sat O
mutely O
near O
the O
fire O

her O
happiness O
, O
bounded O
by O
the O
circle O
of O
the O
consciousness O
of O
the O
presence O
of O
her O
foster O
child O
, O
knowing O
that O
his O
voice O
repeated O
what O
was O
passing O
to O
her O
deafened O
ear O
, O
that O
his O
arm O
removed O
each O
little O
obstacle O
to O
her O
tottering O
steps O
. O
And O
Will O
, O
out O
of O
the O
very O
kindness O
of O
his O
heart O
, O
talked O
more O
and O
more O
merrily O
than O
ever O
. O
He O
saw O
Jem S-PERSON
was O
downcast O
, O
and O
fancied O
his O
rattling O
might O
cheer O
him O

at O
any O
rate O
, O
it O
drowned O
his O
aunt's O
muttered O
grumblings O
, O
and O
in O
some O
measure O
concealed O
the O
blank O
of O
the O
evening O
. O
At O
last O
, O
bed O
- O
time O
came O

and O
Will S-PERSON
withdrew O
to O
his O
neighbouring O
lodging O

and O
Jane S-PERSON
and O
Alice B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
had O
raked O
the O
fire O
, O
and O
fastened O
doors O

shutters O

pattered O
up O
stairs O
, O
with O
their O
tottering O
foot O
- O
steps O
, O
and O
shrill O
voices O
. O
Jem S-PERSON
, O
too O
, O
went O
to O
the O
closet O
termed O
his O
bed-room O
. O
There O
was O
no O
bolt O
to O
the O
door O

but O
by O
one S-CARDINAL
strong O
effort O
of O
his O
right O
arm O
, O
a O
heavy O
chest O
was O
moved O
against O
it O
, O
and O
he O
could O
sit O
down O
on O
the O
side O
of O
his O
bed O
, O
and O
think O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
loved O
another O
! O
That O
idea O
would O
rise O
uppermost O
in O
his O
mind O
, O
and O
had O
to O
be O
combated O
in O
all O
its O
forms O
of O
pain O
. O
It O
was O
, O
perhaps O
, O
no O
great O
wonder O
that O
she O
should O
prefer O
one O
so O
much O
above O
Jem S-PERSON
in O
the O
external O
things O
of O
life O
. O
But O
the O
gentleman O
| | O
why O
did O
he O
, O
with O
his O
range O
of O
choice O
among O
the O
ladies O
of O
the O
land O
, O
why O
did O
he O
stoop O
down O
to O
carry O
off O
the O
poor O
man's O
darling O
? O
With O
all O
the O
glories O
of O
the O
garden O
at O
his O
hand O
, O
why O
did O
he O
prefer O
to O
cull O
the O
wild O
- O
rose O
, O
— O
Jem's S-PERSON
own O
fragrant O
wild O
- O
rose O
? O
His O
own O
! O
Oh O
! O
never O
now O
his O
own O
! O
— O
Gone O
for O
evermore O
! O
Then O
uprose O
the O
guilty O
longing O
for O
blood O
! O
— O
The O
frenzy O
of O
jealousy O
! O
— O
Some O
one O
should O
die O
. O
He O
would O
rather O
Mary S-PERSON
were O
dead O
, O
cold O
in O
her O
grave O
, O
than O
that O
she O
were O
another's O
. O
A O
vision O
of O
her O
pale O
, O
sweet O
face O
, O
with O
her O
bright O
hair O
all O
bedabbled O
with O
gore O
, O
seemed O
to O
float O
constantly O
before O
his O
aching O
eyes O
. O
But O
hers O
were O
ever O
open O
, O
and O
contained O
, O
in O
their O
soft O
, O
deathly O
look O
, O
such O
mute O
reproach O
! O
What O
had O
she O
done O
to O
deserve O
such O
cruel O
treatment O
from O
him O
? O
She O
had O
been O
wooed O
by O
one O
whom O
Jem S-PERSON
knew O
to O
be O
handsome O
, O
gay O
, O
and O
bright O
, O
and O
she O
had O
given O
him O
her O
love O
. O
That O
was O
all O
! O
It O
was O
the O
wooer O
who O
should O
die O
. O
Yes O
, O
die O
, O
knowing O
the O
cause O
of O
his O
death O
. O
Jem S-PERSON
pictured O
him O
( O
and O
gloated O
on O
the O
picture O
) O
, O
lying O
smitten O
, O
yet O
conscious O
| | O
and O
listening O
to O
the O
upbraiding O
accusation O
of O
his O
murderer O
. O
How O
he O
had O
left O
his O
own O
rank O
, O
and O
dared O
to O
love O
a O
maiden O
of O
low O
degree O
| | O
and O
— O
oh O
! O
stinging O
agony O
of O
all O
— O
how O
she O
, O
in O
return O
, O
had O
loved O
him O
! O
Then O
the O
other O
nature O
spoke O
up O
, O
and O
bade O
him O
remember O
the O
anguish O
he O
should O
so O
prepare O
for O
Mary S-PERSON
! O
At O
first S-ORDINAL
he O
refused O
to O
listen O
to O
that O
better O
voice O
| | O
or O
listened O
only O
to O
pervert O
. O
He O
would O
glory O
in O
her O
wailing O
grief O
! O
he O
would O
take O
pleasure O
in O
her O
desolation O
of O
heart O
! O
No O
! O
he O
could O
not O
, O
said O
the O
still O
small O
voice O
. O
It O
would O
be O
worse O
, O
far O
worse O
, O
to O
have O
caused O
such O
woe O
, O
than O
it O
was O
now O
to O
bear O
his O
present O
heavy O
burden O
. O
But O
it O
was O
too O
heavy O
, O
too O
grievous O
to O
be O
borne O
, O
and O
live O
. O
He O
would O
slay O
himself O
, O
and O
the O
lovers O
should O
love O
on O
, O
and O
the O
sun O
shine O
bright O
, O
and O
he O
with O
his O
burning O
, O
woeful O
heart O
would O
be O
at O
rest O
. O
" O
Rest O
that O
is O
reserved O
for O
the O
people O
of O
God O
. O
" O
Had O
he O
not O
promised O
with O
such O
earnest O
purpose O
of O
soul O
, O
as O
makes O
words O
more O
solemn O
than O
oaths O
, O
to O
save O
Mary S-PERSON
from O
becoming O
such O
as O
Esther S-PERSON
? O
Should O
he O
shrink O
from O
the O
duties O
of O
life O
, O
into O
the O
cowardliness O
of O
death O
? O
Who O
would O
then O
guard O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
with O
her O
love O
and O
her O
innocence O
? O
Would O
it O
not O
be O
a O
goodly O
thing O
to O
serve O
her O
, O
although O
she O
loved O
him O
not O

to O
be O
her O
preserving O
angel O
, O
through O
the O
perils O
of O
life O

and O
she O
, O
unconscious O
all O
the O
while O
? O
He O
braced O
up O
his O
soul O
, O
and O
said O
to O
himself O
, O
that O
with O
God's S-PERSON
help O
he O
would O
be O
that O
earthly O
keeper O
. O
And O
now O
the O
mists O
and O
the O
storms O
seemed O
clearing O
away O
from O
his O
path O
, O
though O
it O
still O
was O
full O
of O
stinging O
thorns O
. O
Having O
done O
the O
duty O
nearest O
to O
him O
( O
of O
reducing O
the O
tumult O
of O
his O
own O
heart O
to O
something O
like O
order O
) O
, O
the O
second S-ORDINAL
became O
more O
plain O
before O
him O
. O
Poor O
Esther's S-PERSON
experience O
had O
led O
her O
, O
perhaps O
, O
too O
hastily O
to O
the O
conclusion O
, O
that O
Mr. O
Carson's S-PERSON
intentions O
were O
evil O
towards O
Mary S-PERSON
| | O
at O
least O
she O
had O
given O
no O
just O
ground O
for O
the O
fears O
she O
entertained O
that O
such O
was O
the O
case O
. O
It O
was O
possible O
, O
nay O
, O
to O
Jem's S-PERSON
heart O
, O
very O
probable O
, O
that O
he O
might O
only O
be O
too O
happy O
to O
marry O
her O
. O
She O
was O
a O
lady O
by O
right O
of O
nature O
, O
Jem S-PERSON
thought O

in O
movement O
, O
grace O
, O
and O
spirit O
. O
what O
was O

to O
a O

glory O

, O
as O
far O
as O
wealth O
was O
concerned O
, O
judging O
another O
by O
himself O
, O
Jem S-PERSON
could O
only O
imagine O
it O
a O
great O
privilege O
to O
lay O
it O
at O
the O
feet O
of O
the O
loved O
one O
. O
Harry B-PERSON
Carson's E-PERSON
mother O
had O
been O
a O
factory O
girl O

so O
, O
after O
all O
, O
what O
was O
the O
great O
reason O
for O
doubting O
his O
intentions O
towards O
Mary S-PERSON
? O
There O
might O
probably O
be O
some O
little O
awkwardness O
about O
the O
affair O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
: O
Mary's S-PERSON
father O
having O
such O
strong O
prejudices O
on O
the O
one S-CARDINAL
hand O
| | O
and O
something O
of O
the O
same O
kind O
being O
likely O
to O
exist O
on O
the O
part O
of O
Mr. O
Carson's S-PERSON
family O
. O
But O
Jem S-PERSON
knew O
he O
had O
power O
over O
John B-PERSON
Barton's E-PERSON
mind O

and O
it O
would O
be O
something O
to O
exert O
that O
power O
in O
promoting O
Mary's S-PERSON
happiness O
, O
and O
to O
relinquish O
all O
thought O
of O
self O
in O
so O
doing O

Oh O
! O
why O
had O
Esther S-PERSON
chosen O
him O
for O
this O
office O
? O
It O
was O
beyond O
his O
strength O
to O
act O
rightly O
! O
Why O
had O
she O
singled O
him O
out O
? O
The O
answer O
came O

Poor O

He O
never O

over O
his O

London S-GPE

The O
deep O
mortification O
he O
then O
experienced O
( O
with O
, O
perhaps O
, O
as O
little O
selfishness O
for O
its O
cause O
as O
mortification O
ever O
had O
) O
was O
of O
no O
temporary O
nature O
| | O
indeed O
, O
few O
of O
his O
feelings O
were O
. O
Then O
came O
a O
long O
period O
of O
bodily O
privation O
| | O
of O
daily O
hunger O
after O
food O

and O
though O
he O
tried O
to O
persuade O
himself O
he O
could O
bear O
want O
himself O
with O
stoical O
indifference O
, O
and O
did O
care O
about O
it O
as O
little O
as O
most O
men O
, O
yet O
the O
body O
took O
its O
revenge O
for O
its O
uneasy O
feelings O
. O
The O
mind O
became O
soured O
and O
morose O
, O
and O
lost O
much O
of O
its O
equipoise O

It O
was O
no O
longer O

The O

John B-PERSON

entertained O

were O
the O

I O
have O
somewhere O
read O
a O
forcibly O

punishment O
among O
the O
Italians S-NORP

worthy O
of O
a O
Borgia S-PERSON

The O
supposed O

real O
criminal O

shut O
up O

supplied O
with O
every O
convenience O

luxury O

and O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
mourned O
little O
over O
his O
imprisonment O

But O
day O
by O
day O
he O
became O
aware O
that O
the O
space O
between O
the O
walls O
of O
his O
apartment O
was O
narrowing O
, O
and O
then O
he O
understood O
the O
end O

Those O
painted O
walls O
would O
come O
into O
hideous O
nearness O
, O
and O
at O
last O
crush O
the O
life O
out O
of O
him O
. O
And O
so O
day O
by O
day O
, O
nearer O
and O
nearer O
, O
came O
the O
diseased O
thoughts O
of O
John B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
. O
They O
excluded O
the O
light O
of O
heaven O
, O
the O
cheering O
sounds O
of O
earth O
. O
They O
were O
preparing O
his O
death O
. O
It O
is O
true O
, O
much O
of O
their O
morbid O
power O
might O
be O
ascribed O
to O
the O
use O
of O
opium O

But O
before O
you O
blame O
too O
harshly O
this O
use O
, O
or O
rather O
abuse O
, O
try O
a O
hopeless O

cravings O

Try O
, O
not O
alone O
being O
without O
hope O
yourself O
, O
but O
seeing O
all O
around O
you O
reduced O
to O
the O
same O
despair O
, O
arising O
from O
the O
same O
circumstances O

all O
around O
you O
telling O
( O
though O
they O
use O
no O
words O

language O
) O
, O
by O
their O
looks O

feeble O
actions O

that O
they O
are O
suffering O

sinking O
under O
the O
pressure O

want O

Would O
you O
not O
be O
glad O
to O
forget O
life O
, O
and O
its O
burdens O
? O
And O
opium O
gives O
forgetfulness O
for O
a O
time O

It O
is O
true O
they O
who O
thus O
purchase O
it O
pay O
dearly O
for O
their O
oblivion O

but O
can O
you O
expect O
the O
uneducated O
to O
count O
the O
cost O
of O
their O
whistle O

Poor O
wretches O

They O
pay O
a O
heavy O
price O

worse O

the O
consciousness O

incipient O
madness O

this O
is O
the O
price O

whistle O

you O
taught O
them O

science O
of O
consequences O

God O

not O

that O
their O
interests O
are O
so O
far O
apart O

Whose O
doing O
is O
it O
? O
And O
so O
on O
into O
the O
problems O
and O
mysteries O
of O
life O
, O
until O
, O
bewildered O
and O
lost O
, O
unhappy O
and O
suffering O
, O
the O
only O
feeling O
that O
remained O
clear O
and O
undisturbed O
in O
the O
tumult O
of O
his O
heart O
, O
was O
hatred O
to O
the O
one S-CARDINAL
class O
and O
keen O
sympathy O
with O
the O
other O
. O
But O
what O
availed O
his O
sympathy O
? O
No O
education O
had O
given O
him O
wisdom O

and O
without O
wisdom O
, O
even O
love O
, O
with O
all O
its O
effects O
, O
too O
often O
works O
but O
harm O
. O
He O
acted O
to O
the O
best O
of O
his O
judgment O
, O
but O
it O
was O
a O
widely O
- O
erring O
judgment O
. O
The O
actions O
of O
the O
uneducated O
seem O
to O
me O
typified O
in O
those O
of O
Frankenstein S-PERSON
, O
that O
monster O
of O
many O
human O
qualities O
, O
ungifted O
with O
a O
soul O
, O
a O
knowledge O
of O
the O
difference O
between O
good O

evil O

people O
rise O
up O

irritate O
us O

they O
terrify O
us O

enemies O

Then O
, O
in O
the O
sorrowful O
moment O
of O
our O
triumphant O
power O

their O
eyes O
gaze O
on O
us O

made O

became O

, O
all O
that O

commonly O
called O
wild O

visionary O
. O
Ay O
! O
but O
being O
visionary O
is O
something O
. O
It O
shows O
a O
soul O
, O
a O
being O
not O
altogether O
sensual O

a O
creature O
who O
looks O
forward O

others O
, O
if O
not O
for O
himself O

And O
with O
all O
his O
weakness O
he O
had O
a O
sort O
of O
practical O
power O
, O
which O
made O
him O
useful O
to O
the O
bodies O
of O
men O
to O
whom O
he O
belonged O
. O
He O
had O
a O
ready O
kind O
of O
rough O
Lancashire S-GPE
eloquence O
, O
arising O
out O
of O
the O
fulness O
of O
his O
heart O
, O
which O
was O
very O
stirring O
to O
men O
similarly O
circumstanced O
, O
who O
liked O
to O
hear O
their O
feelings O
put O
into O
words O
. O
He O
had O
a O
pretty O
clear O
head O
at O
times O
, O
for O
method O
and O
arrangement O
| | O
a O
necessary O
talent O
to O
large O
combinations O
of O
men O
. O
And O
what O
perhaps O
more O
than O
all O
made O
him O
relied O
upon O
and O
valued O
, O
was O
the O
consciousness O
which O
every O
one O
who O
came O
in O
contact O
with O
him O
felt O
, O
that O
he O
was O
actuated O
by O
no O
selfish O
motives O
| | O
that O
his O
class O
, O
his O
order O
, O
was O
what O
he O
stood O
by O
, O
not O
the O
rights O
of O
his O
own O
paltry O
self O

For O
even O
in O
great O

noble O
men O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
self O
comes O
into O

it O
becomes O
a O
mean O

A O
little O
time O
before O
this O

there O
had O
come O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
those O
occasions O

deliberation O
among O

employed O

which O
deeply O
interested O
John B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON

and O
the O
discussions O
concerning O
which O
had O
caused O
his O
frequent O
absence O
from O
home O
of O
late O
. O
I O
am O
not O
sure O
if O
I O
can O
express O
myself O
in O
the O
technical O
terms O
of O
either O
masters O
or O
workmen O
, O
but O
I O
will O
try O
simply O
to O
state O
the O
case O
on O
which O
the O
latter O
deliberated O
. O
An O
order O
for O
coarse O
goods O
came O
in O
from O
a O
new O
foreign O
market O
. O
It O
was O
a O
large O
order O
, O
giving O
employment O
to O
all O
the O
mills O
engaged O
in O
that O
species O
of O
manufacture O
: O
but O
it O
was O
necessary O
to O
execute O
it O
speedily O
, O
and O
at O
as O
low O
prices O
as O
possible O
, O
as O
the O
masters O
had O
reason O
to O
believe O
a O
duplicate O
order O
had O
been O
sent O
to O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
continental O
manufacturing O
towns O
, O
where O
there O
were O
no O
restrictions O
on O
food O
, O
no O
taxes O
on O
building O
or O
machinery O
, O
and O
where O
consequently O
they O
dreaded O
that O
the O
goods O
could O
be O
made O
at O
a O
much O
lower O
price O
than O
they O
could O
afford O
them O
for O
| | O
and O
that O
, O
by O
so O
acting O
and O
charging O
, O
the O
rival O
manufacturers O
would O
obtain O
undivided O
possession O
of O
the O
market O
. O
It O
was O
clearly O
their O
interest O
to O
buy O
cotton O
as O
cheaply O
, O
and O
to O
beat O
down O
wages O
as O
low O
as O
possible O
. O
And O
in O
the O
long O
run O
the O
interests O
of O
the O
workmen O
would O
have O
been O
thereby O
benefited O
. O
Distrust O
each O
other O
as O
they O
may O
, O
the O
employers O
and O
the O
employed O
must O
rise O
or O
fall O
together O
. O
There O
may O
be O
some O
difference O
as O
to O
chronology O
, O
none O
as O
to O
fact O
. O
But O
the O
masters O
did O
not O
choose O
to O
make O
all O
these O
facts O
known O
. O
They O
stood O
upon O
being O
the O
masters O
, O
and O
that O
they O
had O
a O
right O
to O
order O
work O
at O
their O
own O
prices O

Now O
let O
us O
turn O
to O
the O
workmen's O
view O
of O
the O
question O
. O
The O
masters O
( O
of O
the O
tottering O
foundation O
of O
whose O
prosperity O
they O
were O
ignorant O
) O
seemed O
doing O
well O
, O
and O
like O
gentlemen O
, O
" O
lived O
at O
home O
in O
ease O
, O
" O
while O
they O
were O
starving O
, O
gasping O
on O
from O
day O
to O
day O
| | O
and O
there O
was O
a O
foreign O
order O
to O
be O
executed O
, O
the O
extent O
of O
which O
, O
large O
as O
it O
was O
, O
was O
greatly O
exaggerated O
| | O
and O
it O
was O
to O
be O
done O
speedily O
. O
Why O
were O
the O
masters O
offering O
such O
low O
wages O
under O
these O
circumstances O
? O
Shame O
upon O
them O
! O
It O
was O
taking O
advantage O
of O
their O
work O
- O
people O
being O
almost O
starved O
| | O
but O
they O
would O
starve O
entirely O
rather O
than O
come O
into O
such O
terms O
. O
It O
was O
bad O
enough O
to O
be O
poor O
, O
while O
by O
the O
labour O
of O
their O
thin O
hands O
, O
the O
sweat O
of O
their O
brows O
, O
the O
masters O
were O
made O
rich O
| | O
but O
they O
would O
not O
be O
utterly O
ground O
down O
to O
dust O
. O
No O
! O
they O
would O
fold O
their O
hands O
, O
and O
sit O
idle O
, O
and O
smile O
at O
the O
masters O
, O
whom O
even O
in O
death O
they O
could O
baffle O
. O
With O
Spartan S-ORG
endurance O
they O
determined O
to O
let O
the O
employers O
know O
their O
power O
, O
by O
refusing O
to O
work O
. O
So O
class O
distrusted O
class O
, O
and O
their O
want O
of O
mutual O
confidence O
wrought O
sorrow O
to O
both O
. O
The O
masters O
would O
not O
be O
bullied O
, O
and O
compelled O
to O
reveal O
why O
they O
felt O
it O
wisest O
and O
best O
to O
offer O
only O
such O
low O
wages O
| | O
they O
would O
not O
be O
made O
to O
tell O
that O
they O
were O
even O
sacrificing O
capital O
to O
obtain O
a O
decisive O
victory O
over O
the O
continental O
manufacturers O
. O
And O
the O
workmen O
sat O
silent O
and O
stern O
with O
folded O
hands O
, O
refusing O
to O
work O
for O
such O
pay O
. O
There O
was O
a O

It O

the O
whisperings O

of O
Will's S-PERSON
visit O
to O
Manchester S-GPE
, O
there O
was O
something O
going O
on O
which O
interested O
Mary S-PERSON
even O
now O
, O
and O
which O
, O
in O
former O
times O
, O
would O
have O
exceedingly O
amused O

excited O
her O

She O
saw O
as O

as O
if O
told O
in O
words O
, O
that O
the O
merry O

plain O
Margaret S-PERSON
: O
she O
doubted O
if O
Margaret S-PERSON
was O
aware O
of O
it O
, O
and O
yet O
, O
as O
she O
watched O
more O
closely O
, O
she O
began O
to O
think O
some O
instinct O
made O
the O
blind O
girl O
feel O
whose O
eyes O
were O
so O
often O
fixed O
upon O
her O
pale O
face O
| | O
that O
some O
inner O
feeling O
made O
the O
delicate O
and O
becoming O
rose O
- O
flush O
steal O
over O
her O
countenance O
. O
She O
did O
not O
speak O
so O
decidedly O
as O
before O
| | O
there O
was O
a O
hesitation O
in O
her O
manner O
, O
that O
seemed O
to O
make O
her O
very O
attractive O
| | O
as O
if O
something O
softer O
, O
more O
loveable O
than O
excellent O
sense O
, O
were O
coming O
in O
as O
a O
motive O
for O
speech O
| | O
her O
eyes O
had O
always O
been O
soft O
, O
and O
were O
in O
no O
ways O
disfigured O
by O
her O
blindness O
, O
and O
now O
seemed O
to O
have O
a O
new O
charm O
, O
as O
they O
quivered O
under O
their O
white O
down O
- O
cast O
lids O
. O
She O
must O
be O
conscious O
, O
thought O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
— O
heart O
answering O
heart O
. O
Will's O
love O
had O
no O
blushings O
, O
no O
downcast O
eyes O
, O
no O
weighing O
of O
words O
| | O
it O
was O
as O
open O
and O
undisguised O
as O
his O
nature O
| | O
yet O
he O
seemed O
afraid O
of O
the O
answer O
its O
acknowledgment O
might O
meet O
with O
. O
It O
was O
Margaret's S-PERSON
angelic O
voice O
that O
had O
entranced O
him O
, O
and O
which O
made O
him O
think O
of O
her O
as O
a O
being O
of O
some O
other O
sphere O
, O
that O
he O
feared O
to O
woo O
. O
So O
he O
tried O
to O
propitiate O
Job O
in O
all O
manner O
of O
ways O
. O
He O
went O
over O
to O
Liverpool S-GPE
to O
rummage O
in O
his O
great O
sea-chest O
for O
the O
flying O
- O
fish O
( O
no O
very O
odorous O
present O
by O
the O
way O
) O
. O
He O
hesitated O
over O
a O
child's O
caul O
for O
some O
time O
, O
which O
was O
, O
in O
his O
eyes O
, O
a O
far O
greater O
treasure O
than O
any O
Exocetus S-PRODUCT
. O
What O
use O
could O
it O
be O
of O
to O
a O
landsman O
? O
Then O
Margaret's S-PERSON
voice O
rang O
in O
his O
ears O
| | O
and O
he O
determined O
to O
sacrifice O
it O
, O
his O
most O
precious O
possession O
, O
to O
one O
whom O
she O
loved O
, O
as O
she O
did O
her O
grandfather O
. O
It O
was O
rather O
a O
relief O
to O
him O
, O
when O
, O
having O
put O
it O
and O
the O
flying O
- O
fish O
together O
in O
a O
brown O
paper O
parcel O
, O
and O
sat O
upon O
them O
for O
security O
all O
the O
way O
in O
the O
railroad O
, O
he O
found O
that O
Job O
was O
so O
indifferent O
to O
the O
precious O
caul O
, O
that O
he O
might O
easily O
claim O
it O
again O
. O
He O
hung O
about O
Margaret S-PERSON
, O
till O
he O
had O
received O
many O
warnings O
and O
reproaches O
from O
his O
conscience O
in O
behalf O
of O
his O
dear O
aunt O
Alice's S-PERSON
claims O
upon O
his O
time O
. O
He O
went O
away O
, O
and O
then O
he O
bethought O
him O
of O
some O
other O
little O
word O
with O
Job O
. O
And O
he O
turned O
back O
, O
and O
stood O
talking O
once O
more O
in O
Margaret's S-PERSON
presence O
, O
door O
in O
hand O
, O
only O
waiting O
for O
some O
little O
speech O
of O
encouragement O
to O
come O
in O
and O
sit O
down O
again O
. O
But O
as O
the O
invitation O
was O
not O
given O
, O
he O
was O
forced O
to O
leave O
at O
last O
, O
and O
go O
and O
do O
his O
duty O
. O
Four B-DATE
days E-DATE
had O
Jem B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
watched O
for O
Mr. O
Harry B-PERSON
Carson E-PERSON
without O
success O
| | O
his O
hours O
of O
going O
and O
returning O
to O
his O
home O
were O
so O
irregular O
, O
owing O
to O
the O
meetings O
and O
consultations O
among O
the O
masters O
, O
which O
were O
rendered O
necessary O
by O
the O
turn O
- O
out O
. O
On O
the B-DATE
fifth E-DATE
, O
without O
any O
purpose O
on O
Jem's S-PERSON
part O
, O
they O
met O
. O
It O
was O
the O
workmen's O
dinner O
- O
hour O
, O
the O
interval O
between O
twelve S-CARDINAL
and O
one O
| | O
when O
the O
streets O
of O
Manchester S-GPE
are O
comparatively O
quiet O
, O
for O
a O
few O
shopping O
ladies O
and O
lounging O
gentlemen O
count O
for O
nothing O
in O
that O
busy O
, O
bustling O
, O
living O
place O
. O
Jem S-PERSON
had O
been O
on O
an O
errand O
for O
his O
master O
, O
instead O
of O
returning O
to O
his O
dinner O
| | O
and O
in O
passing O
along O
a O
lane O
, O
a O
road O
( O
called O
, O
in O
compliment O
to O
the O
intentions O
of O
some O
future O
builder O
, O
a O
street O
) O
, O
he O
encountered O
Harry B-PERSON
Carson E-PERSON
, O
the O
only O
person O
, O
as O
far O
as O
he O
saw O
beside O
himself O
, O
treading O
the O
unfrequented O
path O
. O
Along O
one S-CARDINAL
side O
ran O
a O
high O
broad O
fence O
, O
blackened O
over O
by O
coal O
- O
tar O
, O
and O
spiked O
and O
stuck O
with O
pointed O
nails O
at O
the O
top O
, O
to O
prevent O
any O
one O
from O
climbing O
over O
into O
the O
garden O
beyond O
. O
By O
this O
fence O
was O
the O
foot O
- O
path O
. O
The O
carriage O
road O
was O
such O
as O
no O
carriage O
, O
no O
, O
not O
even O
a O
cart O
, O
could O
possibly O
have O
passed O
along O
, O
without O
Hercules S-PRODUCT
to O
assist O
in O
lifting O
it O
out O
of O
the O
deep O
clay O
ruts O
. O
On O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
way O
was O
a O
dead O
brick O
wall O
| | O
and O
a O
field O
after O
that O
, O
where O
there O
was O
a O
sawpit O
, O
and O
joiner's O
shed O
. O
Jem's S-PERSON
heart O
beat O
violently O
when O
he O
saw O
the O
gay O
, O
handsome O
young O
man O
approaching O
, O
with O
a O
light O
, O
buoyant O
step O
. O
This O
, O
then O
, O
was O
he O
whom O
Mary S-PERSON
loved O
. O
It O
was O
, O
perhaps O
, O
no O
wonder O
| | O
for O
he O
seemed O
to O
the O
poor O
smith O
so O
elegant O
, O
so O
well O
- O
appointed O
, O
that O
he O
felt O
his O
superiority O
in O
externals O
, O
strangely O
and O
painfully O
, O
for O
an O
instant O
. O
Then O
something O
uprose O
within O
him O
, O
and O
told O
him O
, O
that O
" O
a O
man's O
a O
man O
for O
a O
' O
that O
, O
for O
a O
' O
that O
, O
and O
twice O
as O
much O
as O
a O
' O
that O
. O
" O
And O
he O
no O
longer O
felt O
troubled O
by O
the O
outward O
appearance O
of O
his O
rival O
. O
Harry B-PERSON
Carson E-PERSON
came O
on O
, O
lightly O
bounding O
over O
the O
dirty O
places O
with O
almost O
a O
lad's O
buoyancy O
. O
To O
his O
surprise O
the O
dark O
, O
sturdy O
- O
looking O
artisan O
stopped O
him O
by O
saying O
respectfully O
, O
" O
May O
I O
speak O
a O
word O
wi O
' O
you O
, O
sir O
? O
" O
" O
Certainly O
, O
my O
good O
man O
, O
" O
looking O
his O
astonishment O
| | O
then O
finding O
that O
the O
promised O
speech O
did O
not O
come O
very O
quickly O
, O
he O
added O
, O
" O
But O
make O
haste O
, O
for O
I'm O
in O
a O
hurry O
. O
" O
Jem S-PERSON
had O
cast O
about O
for O
some O
less O
abrupt O
way O
of O
broaching O
the O
subject O
uppermost O
in O
his O
mind O
than O
he O
now O
found O
himself O
obliged O
to O
use O
. O
With O
a O
husky O
voice O
that O
trembled O
as O
he O
spoke O
, O
he O
said O
, O
" O
I O
think O
, O
sir O
, O
yo're O
keeping O
company O
wi O
' O
a O
young O
woman O
called O
Mary B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
? O
" O
A O
light O
broke O
in O
upon O
Harry B-PERSON
Carson's E-PERSON
mind O
, O
and O
he O
paused O
before O
he O
gave O
the O
answer O
for O
which O
the O
other O
waited O
. O
Could O
this O
man O
be O
a O
lover O
of O
Mary's S-PERSON
? O
And O
( O
strange O
, O
stinging O
thought O
) O
could O
he O
be O
beloved O
by O
her O
, O
and O
so O
have O
caused O
her O
obstinate O
rejection O
of O
himself O
? O
He O
looked O
at O
Jem O
from O
head O
to O
foot O
, O
a O
black O
, O
grimy O
mechanic O
, O
in O
dirty O
fustian O
clothes O
, O
strongly O
built O
, O
and O
awkward O
( O
according O
to O
the O
dancing O
- O
master O
) O
| | O
then O
he O
glanced O
at O
himself O
, O
and O
recalled O
the O
reflection O
he O
had O
so O
lately O
quitted O
in O
his O
bed-room O
. O
It O
was O
impossible O
. O
No O
woman O
with O
eyes O
could O
choose O
the O
one O
when O
the O
other O
wooed O
. O
It O
was O
Hyperion B-WORK_OF_ART
to I-WORK_OF_ART
a I-WORK_OF_ART
Satyr E-WORK_OF_ART
. O
That O
quotation O
came O
aptly O

he O
forgot O
" O

man's O

man O
for O
a O

" O
And O
yet O
here O
was O
a O
clue O
, O
which O
he O
had O
often O
wanted O

to O
her O

conduct O
towards O
him O

loved O

— O
he O
hated O
the O
fellow O

longed O

him O

would O
know O

with O
his O
glove O
pretended O
to O
brush O
away O

sooty O
contamination O

his O

The O
little O
action O
aroused O
Jem S-PERSON

" O
I O
will O
tell O
you O
in O
plain O
words O
what O
I O
have O
got O
to O
say O
to O
you O
, O
young O
man O
. O
It's O
been O
telled O
me O
by O
one O
as O
knows O
, O
and O
has O
seen O
, O
that O
you O
walk O
with O
this O
same O
Mary B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
, O
and O
are O
known O
to O
be O
courting O
her O

and O
her O
as O
spoke O
to O
me O
about O
it O
, O
thinks O
as O
how O
Mary S-PERSON
loves O
you O
. O
That O
may O
be O
, O
or O
may O
not O
. O
But O
I'm O
an O
old O
friend O
of O
hers O
, O
and O
her O
father's O
| | O
and O
I O
just O
wished O
to O
know O
if O
you O
mean O
to O
marry O
the O
girl O
. O
Spite O
of O
what O
you O
said O
of O
her O
lightness O
, O
I O
ha O
' O
known O
her O
long O
enough O
to O
be O
sure O
she'll O
make O
a O
noble O
wife O
for O
any O
one O
, O
let O
him O
be O
what O
he O
may O
| | O
and O
I O
mean O
to O
stand O
by O
her O
like O
a O
brother O
| | O
and O
if O
you O
mean O
rightly O
, O
you'll O
not O
think O
the O
worse O
on O
me O
for O
what O
I've O
now O
said O
| | O
and O
if O
— O
but O
no O
, O
I'll O
not O
say O
what O
I'll O
do O
to O
the O
man O
who O
wrongs O
a O
hair O
of O
her O
head O
. O
He O
shall O
rue O
it O
the O
longest O
day O
he O
lives O
, O
that's O
all O
. O
Now O
, O
sir O
, O
what O
I O
ask O
of O
you O
is O
this O
. O
If O
you O
mean O
fair O
and O
honourable O
by O
her O
, O
well O
and O
good O

but O
if O
not O
, O
for O
your O
own O
sake O
as O
well O
as O
hers O
, O
leave O
her O
alone O
, O
and O
never O
speak O
to O
her O
more O
. O
" O
Jem's S-PERSON
voice O
quivered O
with O
the O
earnestness O
with O
which O
he O
spoke O
, O
and O
he O
eagerly O
waited O
for O
some O
answer O
. O
Harry B-PERSON
Carson E-PERSON
, O
meanwhile O
, O
instead O
of O
attending O
very O
particularly O
to O
the O
purpose O
the O
man O
had O
in O
addressing O
him O
, O
was O
trying O
to O
gather O
from O
his O
speech O
what O
was O
the O
real O
state O
of O
the O
case O
. O
He O
succeeded O
so O
far O
as O
to O
comprehend O
that O
Jem S-PERSON
inclined O
to O
believe O
that O
Mary S-PERSON
loved O
his O
rival O
| | O
and O
consequently O
, O
that O
if O
the O
speaker O
were O
attached O
to O
her O
himself O
, O
he O
was O
not O
a O
favoured O
admirer O
. O
The O
idea O
came O
into O
Mr. O
Carson's S-PERSON
mind O
, O
that O
perhaps O
, O
after O
all O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
loved O
him O
in O
spite O
of O
her O
frequent O
and O
obstinate O
rejections O
| | O
and O
that O
she O
had O
employed O
this O
person O
( O
whoever O
he O
was O
) O
to O
bully O
him O
into O
marrying O
her O
. O
He O
resolved O
to O
try O
and O
ascertain O
more O
correctly O
the O
man's O
relation O
to O
her O
. O
Either O
he O
was O
a O
lover O
, O
and O
if O
so O
, O
not O
a O
favoured O
one O
( O
in O
which O
case O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
could O
not O
at O
all O
understand O
the O
man's O
motives O
for O
interesting O
himself O
in O
securing O
her O
marriage O
) O

or O
he O
was O
a O
friend O
, O
an O
accomplice O
, O
whom O
she O
had O
employed O
to O
bully O
him O

So O
little O
faith O
in O
goodness O
have O
the O
mean O
and O
selfish O
! O
" O
Before O
I O
make O
you O
into O
my O
confidant O
, O
my O
good O
man O

" O
said O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
contemptuous O
tone O
, O
" O
I O
think O
it O
might O
be O

inquire O
your O

Neither O

He O
paused O

he O
wanted O
a O
distinct O
answer O
to O
this O
last O
supposition O
. O
None O
came O

so O
he O
began O
to O
imagine O
he O
was O
to O
be O
threatened O
into O
some O
engagement O
, O
and O
his O
angry O
spirit O
rose O
. O
" O

so O
, O
my O
fine O
fellow O
, O
you O
will O
have O
the O
kindness O
to O
leave O
us O
to O
ourselves O
, O
and O
not O
meddle O
with O
what O
does O
not O
concern O
you O
. O
If O
you O
were O
a O
brother O

father O
of O
hers O
, O
the O
case O
might O
have O
been O
different O

As O
it O
is O
, O
I O
can O
only O
consider O
you O
an O
impertinent O
meddler O

" O
Again O
he O
would O
have O
passed O
on O

Jem S-PERSON
stood O
in O
a O
determined O
way O

the O
mechanic O

grinding O
his O
words O
out O

teeth O

the O
livid O
paleness O
of O

down O

across O
the O
face O

a O
stinging O
stroke O

instant O

he O
lay O
stretched O

muddy O
road O

standing O
over O
him O

panting O
with O
rage O

moment O

ungovernable O
passion O

conclusion O

violent O
discussion O
going O
on O

a B-TIME
minute E-TIME
he O
had O
pinioned O
Jem S-PERSON

who O
sullenly O
yielded O
to O
the O
surprise O
. O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
was O
on O
his O
feet O
directly O

his O
face O
glowing O
with O
rage O

hissing O
out O
his O
words O
to O

even O
hated O

for O
him O

gasped O
the O

excess O

fare O
no O

insolent O

laughed O

as O
if O

the O
consciousness O
of O
power O

with O
equal O
excitement O

policeman O
now O
interfered O

persuasions O

warnings O

He O
locked O
his O
arm O
in O
Jem's S-PERSON

lead O
him O
away O

an O
opposite O
direction O

that O
in O

he O
saw O

was O
going O

Jem S-PERSON
submitted O
gloomily O

for O
a O
few O
steps O

wrenched O
himself O
free O

policeman O
shouted O

teaching O

that O
the O
way O

one S-CARDINAL

where O
one S-CARDINAL

the O

had O
been O
tried O
for O
a O
cruel O
assault O
on O
a O
poor O

weaver O
, O
who O
had O
attempted O
to O
work O
at O
the O
low O
price O

They O
were O
indignant O
, O
and O
justly O
so O
, O
at O
the O
merciless O
manner O
in O
which O
the O
poor O

been O
treated O

took O
( O

it O
so O
often O

the O
extreme O
form O
of O
revenge O

They O
felt O
as O
if O

rather O
than O
yield O
to O
the O
body O
of O
men O
who O
were O
resorting O
to O
such O
cruel O
measures O
towards O
their O
fellow O

workmen O
, O
they O
, O
the O
masters O

would O
sooner O

all O
the O

be O
derived O
from O
the O
fulfilment O
of O
the O
commission O

in O
order O
that O
the O
workmen O
might O
suffer O
keenly O
. O
They O
forgot O
that O
the O
strike O
was O
in O
this O
instance O
the O
consequence O
of O
want O
and O
need O
, O
suffered O
unjustly O
, O
as O
the O
endurers O
believed O

for O
, O
however O
insane O
, O

without O
ground O
of O
reason O
, O
such O
was O
their O
belief O
, O
and O
such O
was O
the O
cause O
of O
their O
violence O
. O
It O
is O
a O
great O
truth O
, O
that O
you O
cannot O
extinguish O
violence O
by O
violence O

You O
may O
put O
it O
down O

a O
time O

you O
are O
crowing O
over O
your O
imaginary O
success O

see O
if O
it O
does O
not O
return O
with O
seven S-CARDINAL
devils O
worse O
than O
its O
former O

No O

the O
workmen O

openly O

the O

full O
circumstances O

led O
the O

near O
the O
door O
, O
on O
their O
first S-ORDINAL
entrance O
, O
Mr. O
Harry B-PERSON
Carson E-PERSON
had O
taken O
out O
his O
silver O
pencil O
, O
and O
had O
drawn O
an O
admirable O
caricature O
of O
them O
— O
lank O
, O
ragged O
, O
dispirited O
, O
and O
famine O
- O
stricken O
. O
Underneath O
he O
wrote O
a O
hasty O
quotation O
from O
the O
fat O
knight's O
well O
- O
known O
speech O
in O
Henry B-PERSON
IV E-PERSON
. O
He O
passed O
it O
to O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
his O
neighbours O
, O
who O
acknowledged O
the O
likeness O
instantly O
, O
and O
by O
him O
it O
was O
sent O
round O
to O
others O
, O
who O
all O
smiled O
and O
nodded O
their O
heads O
. O
When O
it O
came O
back O
to O
its O
owner O
he O
tore O
the O
back O
of O
the O
letter O
on O
which O
it O
was O
drawn O
, O
in O
two S-CARDINAL

twisted O
them O
up O
, O
and O
flung O
them O
into O
the O
fire O
- O
place O
| | O
but O
, O
careless O
whether O
they O
reached O
their O
aim O
or O
not O
, O
he O
did O
not O
look O
to O
see O
that O
they O
fell O
just O
short O
of O
any O
consuming O
cinders O
. O
This O
proceeding O
was O
closely O
observed O
by O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
men O
. O
He O
watched O
the O
masters O
as O
they O
left O
the O
hotel O
( O
laughing O
, O
some O
of O
them O
were O
, O
at O
passing O
jokes O
) O
, O
and O
when O
all O
had O
gone O
, O
he O
re-entered O
. O
He O
went O
to O
the O
waiter O
, O
who O
recognised O
him O
. O
" O
There's O
a O
bit O
on O
a O

up O
yonder O

" O
The O
waiter O
, O
good O
- O
natured O

sympathetic O
, O
accompanied O
him O
up O

stairs O

saw O
the O
paper O
picked O
up O
and O
untwisted O
, O
and O
then O
being O
convinced O
, O
by O
a O
hasty O
glance O
at O
its O
contents O
, O
that O
it O
was O
only O
what O
the O
man O
had O
called O
it O
, O
" O
a O
bit O
of O
a O

" O
he O
allowed O
him O
to O
bear O
away O
his O
prize O
. O
Towards O
seven B-TIME
o'clock I-TIME
that I-TIME
evening E-TIME
many O
operatives O
began O
to O
assemble O
in O
a O
room O
in O
the O
Weavers' B-FAC

a O
room O
appropriated O
for O

as O
the O
landlord O
, O
in O
his O
circular O
, O
on O
opening O
the O
premises O
, O
had O
described O
it O
. O
But O
, O
alas O
! O
it O
was O
on O
no O
festive O
occasion O
that O
they O
met O
there O
on O
this B-TIME
night E-TIME
. O
Starved O
, O
irritated O
, O
despairing O
men O
, O
they O
were O
assembling O
to O
hear O
the O
answer O
that O
morning O
given O
by O
the O
masters O
to O
their O
delegates O
| | O
after O
which O
, O
as O
was O
stated O
in O
the O
notice O
, O
a O
gentleman O
from O
London S-GPE
would O
have O
the O
honour O
of O
addressing O
the O
meeting O
on O
the O
present O
state O
of O
affairs O
between O
the O
employers O
and O
the O
employed O
, O
or O
( O
as O
he O
chose O
to O
term O
them O
) O
the O
idle O
and O
the O
industrious O
classes O
. O
The O
room O
was O
not O
large O
, O
but O
its O
bareness O
of O
furniture O
made O
it O
appear O
so O
. O
Unshaded O
gas O
flared O
down O
upon O
the O
lean O
and O
unwashed O
artisans O
as O
they O
entered O
, O
their O
eyes O
blinking O
at O
the O
excess O
of O
light O
. O
They O
took O
their O
seats O
on O
benches O
, O
and O
awaited O
the O
deputation O
. O
The O
latter O
, O
gloomily O
and O
ferociously O
, O
delivered O
the O
masters' O
ultimatum O
, O
adding O
thereunto O
not O
one S-CARDINAL
word O
of O
their O
own O
| | O
and O
it O
sank O
all O
the O
deeper O
into O
the O
sore O
hearts O
of O
the O
listeners O
for O
their O
forbearance O
. O
Then O
the O
" O
gentleman O
from O
London S-GPE
" O
( O
who O
had O
been O
previously O
informed O
of O
the O
masters' O
decision O
) O
entered O
. O
You O
would O
have O
been O
puzzled O
to O
define O
his O
exact O
position O
, O
or O
what O
was O
the O
state O
of O
his O
mind O
as O
regarded O
education O
. O
He O
looked O
so O
self O
- O
conscious O
, O
so O
far O
from O
earnest O
, O
among O
the O
group O
of O
eager O
, O
fierce O
, O
absorbed O
men O
, O
among O
whom O
he O
now O
stood O
. O
He O
might O
have O
been O
a O
disgraced O
medical O
student O
of O
the O
Bob B-PERSON
Sawyer E-PERSON
class O
, O
or O
an O
unsuccessful O
actor O
, O
or O
a O
flashy O
shopman O
. O
The O
impression O
he O
would O
have O
given O
you O
would O
have O
been O
unfavourable O
, O
and O
yet O
there O
was O
much O
about O
him O
that O
could O
only O
be O
characterised O
as O
doubtful O
. O
He O
smirked O
in O
acknowledgment O
of O
their O
uncouth O
greetings O
, O
and O
sat O
down O
| | O
then O
glancing O
round O
, O
he O
inquired O
whether O
it O
would O
not O
be O
agreeable O
to O
the O
gentlemen O
present O
to O
have O
pipes O
and O
liquor O
handed O
round O
| | O
adding O
, O
that O
he O
would O
stand O
treat O
. O
As O
the O
man O
who O
has O
had O
his O
taste O
educated O
to O
love O
reading O
, O
falls O
devouringly O
upon O
books O
after O
a O
long O
abstinence O
, O
so O
these O
poor O
fellows O
, O
whose O
tastes O
had O
been O
left O
to O
educate O
themselves O
into O
a O
liking O
for O
tobacco O
, O
beer O
, O
and O
similar O
gratifications O
, O
gleamed O
up O
at O
the O
proposal O
of O
the O
London S-GPE
delegate O
. O
Tobacco O
and O
drink O
deaden O
the O
pangs O
of O
hunger O
, O
and O
make O
one O
forget O
the O
miserable O
home O
, O
the O
desolate O
future O
. O
They O
were O
now O
ready O
to O
listen O
to O
him O
with O
approbation O
. O
He O
felt O
it O

and O
rising O
like O
a O
great O
orator O
, O
with O
his O
right O
arm O
outstretched O
, O
his O
left O
in O
the O
breast O
of O
his O
waistcoat O
, O
he O
began O
to O
declaim O
, O
with O
a O
forced O
theatrical O
voice O
. O
After O
a O
burst O
of O
eloquence O
, O
in O
which O
he O
blended O
the O
deeds O
of O
the O
elder O
and O
the O
younger O
Brutus S-PERSON
, O
and O
magnified O
the O
resistless O
might O
of O
the O
" O
millions S-CARDINAL
of O
Manchester S-GPE

" O
the O

descended O

, O
and O
in O
his O
capacity O
this O
way O
he O
did O
not O
belie O
the O
good O
judgment O
of O
those O
who O
had O
sent O
him O
as O

Masses O

have O
discretion O
in O
distinguishing O
men O

it O
is O
a O
pity O
they O
so O
little O
regard O
temper O
and O
principles O
. O
He O
rapidly O
dictated O
resolutions O

suggested O
measures O
. O
He O
wrote O
out O
a O
stirring O
placard O
for O
the O

He O
proposed O
sending O

by O
a O
liberal O
donation O
from O

The O

before O
alleviating O
any O

to O

they O
turned O
to O
him O
with O
great O
attention O

" O
It O
makes O
me O
more O
than O

it O
makes O
my O

see O
that O

make O
a O

He O
lowered O
his O

well O

A O
low O

it O
did O
not O

words O

John S-PERSON
continued O
— O
" O
You'll O
wonder O
, O
chaps O

how O
I O
came O
to O
miss O
the O
time O
this O
morning O

I'll S-PERSON
just O
tell O
you O
what O
I O
was O
a O
- O
doing O
. O
Th' O
chaplain O
at O
the B-FAC
New I-FAC
Bailey E-FAC
sent O
and O
gived O
me O
an O
order O
to O
see O
Jonas B-PERSON
Higginbotham E-PERSON

him O
as O
was O
taken O
up O
last B-DATE
week E-DATE
for O
throwing O
vitriol O
in O
a O
knob O
- O
stick's O
face O
. O
Well O
, O
I O
couldn't O
help O
but O
go O
| | O
and O
I O
didn't O
reckon O
it O
would O
ha O
' O
kept O
me O
so O
late O
. O
Jonas S-PERSON
were O
like O
one O
crazy O
when O
I O
got O
to O
him O
| | O
he O
said O
he O
could O
na O
get O
rest O
night O
or O
day O
for O
th' O
face O
of O
the O
poor O
fellow O
he O
had O
damaged O
| | O
then O
he O
thought O
on O
his O
weak O
, O
clemmed O
look O
, O
as O
he O
tramped O
, O
foot O
- O
sore O
, O
into O
town O
| | O
and O
Jonas S-PERSON
thought O
, O
may O
be O
, O
he O
had O
left O
them O
at O
home O
as O
would O
look O
for O
news O
, O
and O
hope O
and O
get O
none O
, O
but O
, O
haply O
, O
tidings O
of O
his O
death O
. O
Well O
, O
Jonas S-PERSON
had O
thought O
on O
these O
things O
till O
he O
could O
not O
rest O
, O
but O
walked O
up O
and O
down O
continually O
like O
a O
wild O
beast O
in O
his O
cage O
. O
At O
last O
he O
bethought O
him O
on O
a O
way O
to O
help O
a O
bit O
, O
and O
he O
got O
th' O
chaplain O
to O
send O
for O
me O
| | O
and O
he O
telled O
me O
this O
| | O
and O
that O
th' O
man O
were O
lying O
in O
th' O
Infirmary O
, O
and O
he O
bade O
me O
go O
( O
to O
- O
day's O
the O
day O
as O
folk O
may O
be O
admitted O
into O
th' O
Infirmary O
) O
and O
get O
his O
silver O
watch O
, O
as O
was O
his O
mother's O
, O
and O
sell O
it O
as O
well O
as O
I O
could O
, O
and O
take O
the O
money O
, O
and O
bid O
the O
poor O
knob O
- O
stick O
send O
it O
to O
his O
friends O
beyond O
Burnley S-PERSON

and O
I O
were O
to O
take O
him O
Jonas's S-PERSON
kind O
regards O
, O
and O
he O
humbly O
axed O
him O
to O
forgive O
him O
. O
So O
I O
did O
what O
Jonas S-PERSON
wished O
. O
But O
bless O
your O
life O
, O
none O
on O
us O
would O
ever O
throw O
vitriol O
again O
( O
at O
least O
at O
a O
knob O
- O
stick O
) O
if O
they O
could O
see O
the O
sight O
I O
saw O
to O
- O
day O
. O
The O
man O
lay O
, O
his O
face O
all O
wrapped O
in O
cloths O
, O
so O
I O
didn't O
see O
that O
| | O
but O
not O
a O
limb O
, O
nor O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
limb O
, O
could O
keep O
from O
quivering O
with O
pain O
. O
He O
would O
ha O
' O
bitten O
his O
hand O
to O
keep O
down O
his O
moans O
, O
but O
couldn't O
, O
his O
face O
hurt O
him O
so O
if O
he O
moved O
it O
e'er O
so O
little O
. O
He O
could O
scarce O
mind O
me O
when O
I O
telled O
him O
about O
Jonas S-PERSON
| | O
he O
did O
squeeze O
my O
hand O
when O
I O
jingled O
the O
money O
, O
but O
when O
I O
axed O
his O
wife's O
name O
he O
shrieked O
out O
, O
' O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
shall O
I O
never O
see O
you O
again O
? O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
my O
darling O
, O
they've O
made O
me O
blind O
because O
I O
wanted O
to O
work O
for O
you O
and O
our O
own O
baby O
| | O
oh O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
Mary S-PERSON
! O
' O
Then O
the O
nurse O
came O
, O
and O
said O
he O
were O
raving O
, O
and O
that O
I O
had O
made O
him O
worse O
. O
And O
I'm O
afeard O
it O
was O
true O

yet O
I O
were O
loth O
to O
go O
without O
knowing O
where O
to O
send O
the O
money O
. O
… O
So O
that O
kept O
me O
beyond O
my O
time O
, O
chaps O
. O
" O
" O
Did O
yo O
hear O
where O
the O
wife O
lived O
at O
last O
? O
" O
asked O
many O
anxious O
voices O
. O
" O
No O
! O
he O
went O
on O
talking O
to O
her O
, O
till O
his O
words O
cut O
my O
heart O
like O
a O
knife O
. O
I O
axed O
th' O
nurse O
to O
find O
out O
who O
she O
was O
, O
and O
where O
she O
lived O
. O
But O
what O
I'm O
more O
especial O
naming O
it O
now O
for O
is O
this O
, O
— O
for O
one S-CARDINAL
thing O
I O
wanted O
yo O
all O
to O
know O
why O
I O
weren't O
at O
my O
post O
this O
morning O

for O
another O
, O
I O
wish O
to O
say O
, O
that O
I O
, O
for O
one O
, O
ha O
' O
seen O
enough O
of O
what O
comes O
of O
attacking O
knob O
- O
sticks O
, O
and O
I'll O
ha O
nought O
to O
do O
with O
it O
no O
more O
. O
" O
There O
were O
some O
expressions O
of O
disapprobation O
, O
but O
John S-PERSON
did O
not O
mind O
them O
. O
" O
Nay O
! O
I'm O
no O
coward O
, O
" O
he O
replied O
, O
" O
and O
I'm O
true O
to O
th' O
backbone O
. O
What O
I O
would O
like O
, O
and O
what O
I O
would O
do O
, O
would O
be O
to O
fight O
the O
masters O

There's O
one S-CARDINAL
among O
yo O
called O
me O
a O
coward O
. O
Well O
! O
every O
man O
has O
a O
right O
to O
his O
opinion O

but O
since O
I've O
thought O
on O
th' O
matter O
to O
- O
day O
, O
I've O
thought O
we O
han O
all O
on O
us O
been O
more O
like O
cowards O
in O
attacking O
the O
poor O
like O
ourselves O

them O
as O
has O
none O
to O
help O
, O
but O
mun O
choose O
between O
vitriol O
and O
starvation O
. O
I O
say O
we're O
more O
cowardly O
in O
doing O
that O
than O
in O
leaving O
them O
alone O
. O
No O
! O
what O
I O
would O
do O
is O
this O
. O
Have O
at O
the O
masters O
! O
" O
Again O
he O
shouted O
, O
" O
Have O
at O
the O
masters O
! O
" O
He O
spoke O
lower O

all O
listened O
with O
hushed O
breath O
. O
" O
It's O
the O
masters O
as O
has O
wrought O
this O
woe O

it's O
the O
masters O

should O
pay O

it O

Him O
as O
called O
me O
coward O
just O
now O
, O
may O
try O
if O
I O
am O
one O

not O

Set O
me O
to O
serve O
out O
the O
masters O

see O
if O
there's O
ought O
I'll O
stick O
at O
. O
" O
" O
It O
would O
give O
th' O
masters O
a O
bit O
on O
a O
fright O
if O
one O
on O
them O

growled O
another O

so O
with O
words O
, O
or O
looks O
that O
told O
more O

up O

and O
darker O
grew O
the O
import O
of O
their O
speeches O
, O
as O
they O
stood O
hoarsely O
muttering O
their O
meaning O
out O
, O
and O
glaring O
, O
with O
eyes O
that O
told O
the O
terror O

own O
thoughts O
were O
to O
them O

upon O
their O

Their O
clenched O

their O
livid O
looks O

minds O
were O
voluntarily O
undergoing O
in O
the O
contemplation O
of O
crime O

and O
in O
familiarising O
themselves O
with O
its O
details O
. O
Then O
came O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
those O
fierce O
terrible O
oaths O
which O
bind O
members O
of O
Trades' B-ORG

to O
any O
given O
purpose O
. O
Then O
, O
under O
the O
flaring O
gaslight O
, O
they O
met O
together O
to O
consult O
further O
. O
With O
the O
distrust O
of O
guilt O
, O
each O
was O
suspicious O
of O
his O
neighbour O
| | O
each O
dreaded O
the O
treachery O
of O
another O
. O
A O
number O
of O
pieces O
of O
paper O
( O
the O
identical O
letter O
on O
which O
the O
caricature O
had O
been O
drawn O
that O
very O
morning O
) O
were O
torn O
up O
, O
and O
one O
was O
marked O
. O
Then O
all O
were O
folded O
up O
again O
, O
looking O
exactly O
alike O
. O
They O
were O
shuffled O
together O
in O
a O
hat O
. O
The O
gas O
was O
extinguished O

each O
drew O
out O
a O
paper O
. O
The O
gas O
was O
re-lighted O
. O
Then O
each O
went O
as O
far O
as O
he O
could O
from O
his O
fellows O
, O
and O
examined O
the O
paper O
he O
had O
drawn O
without O
saying O
a O
word O
, O
and O
with O
a O
countenance O
as O
stony O
and O
immovable O
as O
he O
could O
make O
it O
. O
Then O
, O
still O
rigidly O
silent O
, O
they O
each O
took O
up O
their O
hats O
and O
went O
every O
one O
his O
own O
way O
. O
He O
who O
had O
drawn O
the O
marked O
paper O
had O
drawn O
the O
lot O
of O
the O
assassin O

and O
he O
had O
sworn O

act O

his O
drawing O
! O
But O
no O
one O

Mary S-PERSON
was O
surprised O
, O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
some O
little O
bustle O
in O
which O
she O
was O
engaged O
, O
by O
the O
entrance O
of O
Will B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON

He O
looked O
strange O

at O

it O
was O
strange O
to O

any O
different O
expression O
on O
his O
face O
to O
his O
usual O
joyous O
beaming O
appearance O

He O
had O
a O
paper O

He O
came O
in O
, O
and O
sat O
down O
, O
more O
quietly O
than O
usual O
. O
" O
Why O
, O
Will O

what's O
the O
matter O
with O
you O

up O
about O
something O

" O
Mary S-PERSON
left O
off O
ironing O

came O

stood O
near O
the O
fire O
- O
place O
. O
She O
had O
always O
liked O
Will S-PERSON

but O
now O
it O
seemed O
as O
if O
a O
sudden O
spring O
of O
sisterly O
love O
had O
gushed O
up O
in O
her O
heart O
, O
so O
sorry O
did O
she O
feel O
to O
hear O
of O
his O
approaching O
departure O

" O

himself O

he O

understood O
the O

was O

generalised O

She O
spoke O
again O

not O
a O

you O
came O

you O
knocked O
at O

, O
you O
see O

got O
a O
letter O

said O
he O
, O
evidently O
fearing O
the O
strength O
of O
his O
own O
resolution O
, O
if O
hard O
pressed O
by O
entreaty O

out O

three B-MONEY

no O

even O
a O
sixpence O
left O
, O
at O
least O
not O
here O

before O
I O
came O
here O
I O
gave O
my O
landlady O
enough O
to O
carry O
me O
to O
the O
island O

back O
, O

may O
be O
a O
trifle O
for O
presents O

brought O
all O

rest O
here O

all O
gone O

this O
, O

jingling O
a O
few O
coppers O

fret O
over O

thirty B-QUANTITY

" O
added O
he O
, O
as O
he O
saw O
she O
looked O
grave O
and O
sorry O
. O
" O
It's O
a O
fine O
clear O
night O
, O

I O
shall O
set O
off O
betimes O
, O

get O
in O
afore O
the O
Manx S-NORP
packet O
sails O

Where's O
your O
father O
going O
? O
To O
Glasgow S-GPE

did O
you O
say O
? O
Perhaps O
he O

I O
may O
have O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
trip O
together O

, O
for O
, O
if O
the O
Manx S-NORP
boat O
has O
sailed O
when O
I O
get O
into O
Liverpool S-GPE

I O
shall O
go O
by O
a O
Scotch S-ORG
packet O

he O
going O
to O
do O
in O
Glasgow S-GPE

for O
work O

is O
as O
bad O
there O

here O

" O
" O
No O

he O
knows O
that O
, O
" O
answered O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
sadly O
. O
" O
I O
sometimes O
think O
he'll O
never O
get O
work O
again O
, O

that O
trade O
will O
never O
mend O

very O
hard O

keep O
up O
one's O
heart O

I O
wish O
I O
were O
a O
boy O

I'd O
go O
to O
sea O

you O

would O
be O
getting O
away O
from O
bad O
news O

any O
rate O

and O
now O
, O
there's O
hardly O
a O
creature O
that O
crosses O
the O
door O
- O
step O
, O
but O
has O
something O
sad O
and O
unhappy O
to O
tell O
one O

is O
going O
as O
a O
delegate O
from O
his O
Union S-ORG

He's O
starting O
this B-TIME
evening E-TIME

" O
Mary S-PERSON
sighed O
, O
for O
the O
feeling O
again O
came O
over O
her O
that O
it O
was O
very O
flat O
to O
be O

alone O

" O

asked O
the O
young O
sailor O

anxiously O
. O
" O
No O

" O
replied O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
smiling O
a O
little O
, O
" O
she's O
the O
only O
one O
I O
know O

I O
believe O

free O

Her O
blindness O
almost O
appears O
a O

was O
so O
downhearted O
when O

dreaded O

now O
she O
seems O
so O
calm O

happy O

Margaret's S-PERSON

been O
otherwise O

said O
Will S-PERSON
, O
thoughtfully O
. O
" O

could O
have O

so O
glad O

cherish O
her O

asked O
Mary S-PERSON

" O
Oh O
! O
I O
don't O
know O

seems O
so O

her O
voice O

When O
I O
hear O
it O

think O
of O
the O

much O
out O

" O
Mary S-PERSON
could O
not O
help O
laughing O
outright O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
her O
depression O
, O
at O
the O
idea O
of O
Margaret S-PERSON
as O
an O
angel O

it O
was O
so O
difficult O
( O
even O
to O
her O
dress O

making O
imagination O
) O
to O
fancy O
where O

the O
wings O
would O
be O
fastened O

the O
brown O
stuff O
gown O

the O
blue O

Will O
laughed O

too O

a O
little O
, O
out O
of O
sympathy O
with O
Mary's S-PERSON
pretty O
merry O

Then O
he O
said O
— O
" O

you O
may O
laugh O

Mary S-PERSON
was O
carnation O
colour O
, O
and O
the O
tears O
sprang O
to O
her O
soft O
gray O
eyes O
| | O
she O
was O
suffering O
so O
much O
from O
the O
doubts O
arising O
from O
love O
! O
It O
was O
unkind O
of O
him O
. O
He O
did O
not O
notice O
her O
change O
of O
look O
and O
of O
complexion O
. O
He O
only O
noticed O
that O
she O
was O
silent O
, O
so O
he O
continued O
: O
" O
I O
thought O
— O
I O
think O
, O
that O
when O
I O
come O
back O
from O
this O
voyage O
, O
I O
will O
speak O
. O
It's O
my O
fourth S-ORDINAL
voyage O
in O
the O
same O
ship O
, O
and O
with O
the O
same O
captain O
, O
and O
he's O
promised O
he'll O
make O
me O
second S-ORDINAL
mate O
after O
this O
trip O
| | O
then O
I O
shall O
have O
something O
to O
offer O
Margaret S-PERSON
| | O
and O
her O
grandfather O
, O
and O
aunt O
Alice S-PERSON
, O
shall O
live O
with O
her O
, O
to O
keep O
her O
from O
being O
lonesome O
while O
I'm O
at O
sea O
. O
I'm O
speaking O
as O
if O
she O
cared O
for O
me O
, O
and O
would O
marry O
me O
| | O
d'ye O
think O
she O
does O
care O
at O
all O
for O
me O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
? O
" O
asked O
he O
, O
anxiously O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
had O
a O
very O
decided O
opinion O
of O
her O
own O
on O
the O
subject O
, O
but O
she O
did O
not O
feel O
as O
if O
she O
had O
any O
right O
to O
give O
it O
. O
So O
she O
said O
— O
" O
You O
must O
ask O
Margaret S-PERSON
, O
not O
me O
, O
Will O
| | O
she's O
never O
named O
your O
name O
to O
me O
. O
" O
His O
countenance O
fell O
. O
" O
But O
I O
should O
say O
that O
was O
a O
good O
sign O
from O
a O
girl O
like O
her O
. O
I've O
no O
right O
to O
say O
what O
I O
think O
| | O
but O
, O
if O
I O
was O
you O
, O
I O
would O
not O
leave O
her O
now O
without O
speaking O
. O
" O
" O
No O
! O
I O
cannot O
speak O
! O
I O
have O
tried O
. O
I've O
been O
in O
to O
wish O
them O
good O
- O
bye O
, O
and O
my O
voice O
stuck O
in O
my O
throat O
. O
I O
could O
say O
nought O
of O
what O
I'd S-PERSON
planned O
to O
say O
| | O
and O
I O
never O
thought O
of O
being O
so O
bold O
as O
to O
offer O
her O
marriage O
till O
I'd O
been O
my O
next O
trip O
, O
and O
been O
made O
mate O
. O
I O
could O
not O
even O
offer O
her O
this O
box O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
undoing O
his O
paper O
parcel O
and O
displaying O
a O
gaudily O
ornamented O
accordion O
| | O
" O
I O
longed O
to O
buy O
her O
something O
, O
and O
I O
thought O
, O
if O
it O
were O
something O
in O
the O
music O
line O
, O
she O
would O
may O
- O
be O
fancy O
it O
more O
. O
So O
, O
will O
you O
give O
it O
to O
her O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
when O
I'm O
gone O
? O
and O
, O
if O
you O
can O
slip O
in O
something O
tender O
, O
— O
something O
, O
you O
know O
, O
of O
what O
I O
feel O
, O
— O
may O
- O
be O
she O
would O
listen O
to O
you O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
" O
Mary S-PERSON
promised O
that O
she O
would O
do O
all O
that O
he O
asked O
. O
" O
I O
shall O
be O
thinking O
on O
her O
many O
and O
many O
a O
night O
, O
when O
I'm O
keeping O
my O
watch O
in O
mid-sea O
| | O
I O
wonder O
if O
she O
will O
ever O
think O
on O
me O
when O
the O
wind O
is O
whistling O
, O
and O
the O
gale O
rising O
. O
You'll O
often O
speak O
of O
me O
to O
her O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
? O
And O
if O
I O
should O
meet O
with O
any O
mischance O
, O
tell O
her O
how O
dear O
, O
how O
very O
dear O
, O
she O
was O
to O
me O
, O
and O
bid O
her O
, O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
one O
who O
loved O
her O
well O
, O
try O
and O
comfort O
my O
poor O
aunt O
Alice S-PERSON
. O
Dear O
old O
aunt O
! O
you O
and O
Margaret S-PERSON
will O
often O
go O
and O
see O
her O
, O
won't O
you O
? O
She's S-PERSON
sadly O
failed O
since O
I O
was O
last O
ashore O
. O
And O
so O
good O
as O
she O
has O
been O
! O
When O
I O
lived O
with O
her O
, O
a O
little O
wee O
chap O
, O
I O
used O
to O
be O
wakened O
by O
the O
neighbours O
knocking O
her O
up O
| | O
this O
one O
was O
ill O
, O
or O
that O
body's O
child O
was O
restless O
| | O
and O
, O
for O
as O
tired O
as O
ever O
she O
might O
be O
, O
she O
would O
be O
up O
and O
dressed O
in O
a O
twinkling O
, O
never O
thinking O
of O
the O
hard O
day's O
wash O
afore O
her O
next O
morning O
. O
Them O
were O
happy O
times O
! O
How O
pleased O
I O
used O
to O
be O
when O
she O
would O
take O
me O
into O
the O
fields O
with O
her O
to O
gather O
herbs O
! O
I've O
tasted O
tea O
in O
China S-GPE
since O
then O
, O
but O
it O
wasn't O
half O
so O
good O
as O
the O
herb O
tea O
she O
used O
to O
make O
for O
me O
o' O
Sunday B-DATE
nights E-DATE
. O
And O
she O
knew O
such O
a O
deal O
about O
plants O
and O
birds O
, O
and O
their O
ways O
! O
She O
used O
to O
tell O
me O
long O
stories O
about O
her O
childhood O
, O
and O
we O
used O
to O
plan O
how O
we O
would O
go O
sometime O
, O
please O
God O
( O
that O
was O
always O
her O
word O
) O
, O
and O
live O
near O
her O
old O
home O
beyond O
Lancaster S-GPE
| | O
in O
the O
very O
cottage O
where O
she O
was O
born O
if O
we O
could O
get O
it O
. O
Dear O
! O
and O
how O
different O
it O
is O
! O
Here O
is O
she O
still O
in O
a O
back O
street O
o' O
Manchester S-GPE
, O
never O
likely O
to O
see O
her O
own O
home O
again O
| | O
and O
I O
, O
a O
sailor O
, O
off O
for O
America S-GPE
next B-DATE
week E-DATE
. O
I O
wish O
she O
had O
been O
able O
to O
go O
to O
Burton S-PERSON
once O
afore O
she O
died O
. O
" O
" O
She O
would O
may O
be O
have O
found O
all O
sadly O
changed O
, O
" O
said O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
though O
her O
heart O
echoed O
Will's S-PERSON
feeling O
. O
" O
Ay O
! O
ay O
! O
I O
dare O
say O
it's O
best O
. O
One S-CARDINAL
thing O
I O
do O
wish O
though O
, O
and O
I O
have O
often O
wished O
it O
when O
out O
alone O
on O
the O
deep O
sea O
, O
when O
even O
the O
most O
thoughtless O
can't O
choose O
but O
think O
on O
th' O
past O
and O
th' O
future O
| | O
and O
that O
is O
, O
that O
I'd O
never O
grieved O
her O
. O
Oh O
Mary S-PERSON
! O
many O
a O
hasty O
word O
comes O
sorely O
back O
on O
the O
heart O
, O
when O
one O
thinks O
one O
shall O
never O
see O
the O
person O
whom O
one O
has O
grieved O
again O
! O
" O
They O
both O
stood O
thinking O
. O
Suddenly O
Mary S-PERSON
started O
. O
" O
That's O
father's O
step O
. O
And O
his O
shirt's O
not O
ready O
! O
" O
She O
hurried O
to O
her O
irons O
, O
and O
tried O
to O
make O
up O
for O
lost O
time O
. O
John B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
came O
in O
. O
Such O
a O
haggard O
and O
wildly O
anxious O
looking O
man O
, O
Will S-PERSON
thought O
he O
had O
never O
seen O
. O
He O
looked O
at O
Will S-PERSON
, O
but O
spoke O
no O
word O
of O
greeting O
or O
welcome O
. O
" O
I'm O
come O
to O
bid O
you O
good O
bye O
, O
" O
said O
the O
sailor O
, O
and O
would O
in O
his O
sociable O
friendly O
humour O
have O
gone O
on O
speaking O
. O
But O
John S-PERSON
answered O
abruptly O
, O
" O
Good O
bye O
to O
ye O
, O
then O
. O
" O
There O
was O
that O
in O
his O
manner O
which O
left O
no O
doubt O
of O
his O
desire O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
the O
visitor O
, O
and O
Will S-PERSON
accordingly O
shook O
hands O
with O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
and O
looked O
at O
John S-PERSON
, O
as O
if O
doubting O
how O
far O
to O
offer O
to O
shake O
hands O
with O
him O
. O
But O
he O
met O
with O
no O
answering O
glance O
or O
gesture O
, O
so O
he O
went O
his O
way O
, O
stopping O
for O
an O
instant O
at O
the O
door O
to O
say O
, O
" O
You'll O
think O
on O
me O
on O
Tuesday S-DATE
, O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
That's O
the O
day O
we O
shall O
hoist O
our O
blue O
Peter S-PERSON
, O
Jack B-PERSON
Harris E-PERSON
says O
. O
" O
Mary S-PERSON
was O
heartily O
sorry O
when O
the O
door O
closed O
| | O
it O
seemed O
like O
shutting O
out O
a O
friendly O
sunbeam O
. O
And O
her O
father O
! O
what O
could O
be O
the O
matter O
with O
him O
? O
He O
was O
so O
restless O
| | O
not O
speaking O
( O
she O
wished O
he O
would O
) O
, O
but O
starting O
up O
and O
then O
sitting O
down O
, O
and O
meddling O
with O
her O
irons O
| | O
he O
seemed O
so O
fierce O
, O
too O
, O
to O
judge O
from O
his O
face O
. O
She O
wondered O
if O
he O
disliked O
Will O
being O
there O
| | O
or O
if O
he O
were O
vexed O
to O
find O
that O
she O
had O
not O
got O
further O
on O
with O
her O
work O
. O
At O
last O
she O
could O
bear O
his O
nervous O
way O
no O
longer O
, O
it O
made O
her O
equally O
nervous O
and O
fidgetty O
. O
She O
would O
speak O
. O
" O
When O
are O
you O
going O
, O
father O
? O
I O
don't O
know O
the O
time O
o' O
the O
trains O
. O
" O
" O
And O
why O
shouldst O
thou O
know O
? O
" O
replied O
he O
, O
gruffly O
. O
" O
Meddle O
with O
thy O
ironing O
, O
but O
donnot O
be O
asking O
questions O
about O
what O

concern O
thee O

" O
" O
I O
wanted O
to O
get O
you O
something O
to O
eat O
first S-ORDINAL

" O
answered O
she O
, O
gently O
. O
" O
Thou O
dost O
not O
know O
that O
I'm O
larning O
to O
do O
without O
food O

" O
said O
he O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
looked O
at O
him O
to O
see O
if O
he O
spoke O
jestingly O
. O
No O
! O
he O
looked O
savagely O
grave O
. O
She O
finished O
her O
bit O
of O
ironing O
, O
and O
began O
preparing O
the O
food O
she O
was O
sure O
her O
father O
needed O

for O
by O
this O
time O
her O
experience O
in O
the O
degrees O
of O
hunger O
had O
taught O
her O
that O
his O
present O
irritability O
was O
increased O
, O
if O
not O
caused O
, O
by O
want O
of O
food O
. O
He O
had O
had O
a O
sovereign O
given O
him O
to O
pay O
his O
expenses O
as O
delegate O
to O
Glasgow S-GPE
, O
and O
out O
of O
this O
he O
had O
given O
Mary S-PERSON
a B-MONEY
few I-MONEY
shillings E-MONEY
in O
the O
morning O

so O
she O
had O
been O
able O
to O
buy O
a O
sufficient O
meal O
, O
and O
now O
her O
care O
was O
to O
cook O
it O
so O
as O
most O
to O
tempt O
him O
. O
" O
If O
thou'rt O
doing O
that O
for O
me O

Mary S-PERSON
, O
thou O
may'st O
spare O
thy O
labour O

I O
telled O
thee O

were O
not O
for O

" O
" O
Just O
a O
little O
bit O
, O
father O
, O
before O
starting O

" O
coaxed O
Mary S-PERSON

perseveringly O

At O
that O
instant O

who O
should O
come O
in O

Job B-PERSON
Legh E-PERSON

It O
was O
not O
often O

came O

when O

did O
pay O
visits O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
knew O
from O
past O
experience O
they O
were O
any O
thing O

short O
. O
Her O
father's O
countenance O
fell O
back O
into O
the O
deep O
gloom O
from O
which O
it O
was O
but O
just O
emerging O
at O
the O
sound O
of O
Mary's S-PERSON
sweet O
voice O
, O

pretty O
pleading O

He O
became O
again O
restless O

fidgetty O

the O

house O

Job O
, O
however O
, O
did O
not O
stand O
upon O
ceremony O
. O
He O
had O
come O
to O
pay O
a O
visit O
, O
and O
was O
not O
to O
be O
daunted O
from O
his O
purpose O

He O
was O
interested O
in O
John B-PERSON
Barton's E-PERSON
mission O
to O
Glasgow S-GPE
, O
and O
wanted O
to O
hear O
all O
about O
it O
| | O
so O
he O
sat O
down O
, O
and O
made O
himself O
comfortable O
, O
in O
a O
manner O
that O
Mary S-PERSON
saw O
was O
meant O
to O
be O
stationary O
. O
" O
So O
thou'rt O
off O
to O
Glasgow S-GPE
, O
art O
thou O
? O
" O
he O
began O
his O
catechism O
. O
" O
Ay O
. O
" O
" O
When O
art O
starting O
? O
" O
" O
To-night O

" O
" O
That O
I O
knowed O

But O
by O
what O
train O
? O
" O
That O
was O
just O
what O
Mary S-PERSON
wanted O
to O
know O

but O
what O
apparently O
her O
father O
was O
in O
no O
mood O
to O
tell O
. O
He O
got O
up O
without O
speaking O
, O
and O
went O
up O
- O
stairs O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
knew O
from O
his O
step O
, O
and O
his O
way O
, O
how O
much O
he O
was O
put O
out O
, O
and O
feared O
Job O
would O
see O
it O
, O
too O
. O
But O
no O
! O
Job O
seemed O
imperturbable O
. O
So O
much O
the O
better O
, O
and O
perhaps O
she O
could O
cover O
her O
father's O
rudeness O
by O
her O
own O
civility O
to O
so O
kind O
a O
friend O

So O
half O
listening O
to O
her O
father's O
movements O
up O

stairs O
, O
( O
passionate O
, O
violent O

restless O

they O
were O
) O
and O
half O
attending O
to O
Job B-PERSON
Legh E-PERSON

she O
tried O

him O
all O

themselves O

me O
silly O

differing O
with O
them O

well O
! O
there's O
no O
harm O
in O
that O

But O
then O
they O
won't O
let O
me O
be O
silly O
in O
peace O

quietness O
, O
but O
will O
force O
me O
to O
be O
as O
wise O
as O
they O
are O

now O
that's O
not O
British S-NORP

I O
say O

I'm O
forced O
to O
be O
wise O

they O
parsecute O
me O

me O
out O

" O
What O
could O
her O
father O
be O
doing O
up O
- O
stairs O
? O
Tramping O
and O
banging O
about O

Why O
did O
he O
not O
come O
down O
? O
Or O
why O
did O
not O
Job O
go O

The O
supper O
would O
be O
spoilt O

But O
Job S-PERSON
had O
no O
notion O

going O

" O
You O
see O
my O
folly O
is O
this O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
I O
would O
take O
what O
I O
could O
get O

I O
think O
half O
a O
loaf O
is O
better O
than O
no O
bread O

I O
would O
work O
for O
low O

than O
sit O
idle O

But O
, O
comes O
the B-GPE

says O

' O
Well O
, O
if O
you O
take O
the O

we'll O
worry O
you O
out O

you O

will O
you O

' O
Now O
clemming O
is O
a O
quiet O
death O

worrying O
isn't O
, O
so O
I O
choose O
clemming O
, O
and O
come O
into O
th' O
Union S-ORG

But O
I O
wish O
they'd O
leave O
me O
free O
, O
if O
I O
am O
a O
fool O
. O
" O
Creak O
, O
creak O
, O
went O
the O
stairs O
. O
Her O
father O
was O
coming O
down O
at O
last O
. O
Yes O
, O
he O
came O
down O
, O
but O
more O
doggedly O
fierce O
than O
before O
, O
and O
made O
up O
for O
his O
journey O
, O
too O
| | O
with O
his O
little O
bundle O
on O
his O
arm O
. O
He O
went O
up O
to O
Job O
, O
and O
, O
more O
civilly O
than O
Mary S-PERSON
expected O
, O
wished O
him O
good O
- O
bye O
. O
He O
then O
turned O
to O
her O
, O
and O
in O
a O
short O
cold O
manner O
, O
bade O
her O
farewell O
. O
" O
Oh O
! O
father O
, O
don't O
go O
yet O
. O
Your O
supper O
is O
all O
ready O
. O
Stay O
one S-CARDINAL
moment O
! O
" O
But O
he O
pushed O
her O
away O
, O
and O
was O
gone O
. O
She O
followed O
him O
to O
the O
door O
, O
her O
eyes O
blinded O
by O
sudden O
tears O
| | O
she O
stood O
there O
looking O
after O
him O
. O
He O
was O
so O
strange O
, O
so O
cold O
, O
so O
hard O
. O
Suddenly O
, O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
court O
, O
he O
turned O
, O
and O
saw O
her O
standing O
there O
| | O
he O
came O
back O
quickly O
, O
and O
took O
her O
in O
his O
arms O
. O
" O
God O
bless O
thee O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
! O
— O
God O
in O
heaven O
bless O
thee O
, O
poor O
child O
! O
" O
She O
threw O
her O
arms O
round O
his O
neck O
. O
" O
Don't S-PERSON
go O
yet O
, O
father O

I O
can't O
bear O
you O
to O
go O
yet O
. O
Come O
in O
, O
and O
eat O
some O
supper O
| | O
you O
look O
so O
ghastly O
| | O
dear O
father O
, O
do O
! O
" O
" O
No O
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
faintly O
and O
mournfully O
. O
" O
It's O
best O
as O
it O
is O
. O
I O
couldn't O
eat O
, O
and O
it's O
best O
to O
be O
off O
. O
I O
cannot O
be O
still O
at O
home O
. O
I O
must O
be O
moving O
. O
" O
So O
saying O
, O
he O
unlaced O
her O
soft O
twining O
arms O
, O
and O
kissing O
her O
once O
more O
, O
set O
off O
on O
his O
fierce O
errand O
. O
And O
he O
was O
out O
of O
sight O
! O
She O
did O
not O
know O
why O
, O
but O
she O
had O
never O
before O
felt O
so O
depressed O
, O
so O
desolate O
. O
She O
turned O
in O
to O
Job O
, O
who O
sat O
there O
still O
. O
Her O
father O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
was O
out O
of O
sight O
, O
slackened O
his O
pace O
, O
and O
fell O
into O
that O
heavy O
listless O
step O
, O
which O
told O
as O
well O
as O
words O
could O
do O
, O
of O
hopelessness O
and O
weakness O
. O
It O
was O
getting O
dark O
, O
but O
he O
loitered O
on O
, O
returning O
no O
greeting O
to O
any O
one O
. O
A O
child's O
cry O
caught O
his O
ear O
. O
His O
thoughts O
were O
running O
on O
little O
Tom S-PERSON
| | O
on O
the O
dead O
and O
buried O
child O
of O
happier O
years S-DATE
. O
He O
followed O
the O
sound O
of O
the O
wail O
, O
that O
might O
have O
been O
his O
, O
and O
found O
a O
poor O
little O
mortal O
, O
who O
had O
lost O
his O
way O
, O
and O
whose O
grief O
had O
choked O
up O
his O
thoughts O
to O
the O
single O
want O
, O
" O
Mammy O
, O
mammy O
. O
" O
With O
tender O
address O
, O
John B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
soothed O
the O
little O
laddie O
, O
and O
with O
beautiful O
patience O
he O
gathered O
fragments O
of O
meaning O
from O
the O
half S-CARDINAL
spoken O
words O
which O
came O
mingled O
with O
sobs O
from O
the O
terrified O
little O
heart O
. O
So O
, O
aided O
by O
inquiries O
here O
and O
there O
from O
a O
passer O
- O
by O
, O
he O
led O
and O
carried O
the O
little O
fellow O
home O
, O
where O
his O
mother O
had O
been O
too O
busy O
to O
miss O
him O
, O
but O
now O
received O
him O
with O
thankfulness O
, O
and O
with O
an O
eloquent O
Irish S-NORP
blessing O
. O
When O
John S-PERSON
heard O
the O
words O
of O
blessing O
, O
he O
shook O
his O
head O
mournfully O
, O
and O
turned O
away O
to O
retrace O
his O
steps O
. O
Let O
us O
leave O
him O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
took O
her O
sewing O
after O
he O
had O
gone O
, O
and O
sat O
on O
, O
and O
sat O
on O
, O
trying O
to O
listen O
to O
Job S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
more O
inclined O
to O
talk O
than O
usual O
. O
She O
had O
conquered O
her O
feeling O
of O
impatience O
towards O
him O
so O
far O
as O
to O
be O
able O
to O
offer O
him O
her O
father's O
rejected O
supper O
| | O
and O
she O
even O
tried O
to O
eat O
herself O
. O
But O
her O
heart O
failed O
her O
. O
A O
leaden O
weight O
seemed O
to O
hang O
over O
her O
| | O
a O
sort O
of O
presentiment O
of O
evil O
, O
or O
perhaps O
only O
an O
excess O
of O
low O
- O
spirited O
feeling O
in O
consequence O
of O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
departures O
which O
had O
taken O
place O
that B-TIME
afternoon E-TIME
. O
She O
wondered O
how O
long O
Job B-PERSON
Legh E-PERSON
would O
sit O
. O
She O
did O
not O
like O
putting O
down O
her O
work O
, O
and O
crying O
before O
him O
, O
and O
yet O
she O
had O
never O
in O
her O
life O
longed O
so O
much O
to O
be O
alone O
in O
order O
to O
indulge O
in O
a O
good O
hearty O
burst O
of O
tears O
. O
" O
Well O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
" O
she O
suddenly O
caught O
him O
saying O
, O
" O
I O
thought O
you'd O
be O
a O
bit O
lonely O
to O
- O
night O
| | O
and O
as O
Margaret S-PERSON
were O
going O
to O
cheer O
th' O
old O
woman O
, O
I O
said O
I'd O
go O
and O
keep O
th' O
young O
un O
company O
| | O
and O
a O
very O
pleasant O
, O
chatty O
evening O
we've O
had O
| | O
very O
. O
Only O
I O
wonder O
as O
Margaret S-PERSON
is O
not O
come O
back O
. O
" O
" O
But O
perhaps O
she O
is O
, O
" O
suggested O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
" O
No O
, O
no O
, O
I O
took O
care O
o' O
that O
. O
Look O
ye O
here O
! O
" O
and O
he O
pulled O
out O
the O
great O
house O
- O
key O
. O
" O
She'll O
have O
to O
stand O
waiting O
i' O
th' O
street O
, O
and O
that O
I'm O
sure O
she O
wouldn't O
do O
, O
when O
she O
knew O
where O
to O
find O
me O
. O
" O
" O
Will O
she O
come O
back O
by O
hersel O
? O
" O
asked O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
" O
Ay O
. O
At O
first O
I O
were O
afraid O
o' O
trusting O
her O
, O
and O
I O
used O
to O
follow O
her O
a O
bit O
behind O
| | O
never O
letting O
on O
, O
of O
course O
. O
But O
, O
bless O
you O
! O
she O
goes O
along O
as O
steadily O
as O
can O
be O

rather O
slow O
, O
to O
be O
sure O
, O
and O
her O
head O
a O
bit O
on O
one O
side O
as O
if O
she O
were O
listening O
. O
And O
it's O

a O

off O

The O
afternoon O

the O
parting O

what O
does O
the O

asked O

" O
Oh O
! O
much O

Margaret S-PERSON

having O
told O

leant O
back O

weariness O

both O
of O

Mary S-PERSON
hastened O
to O
make O
her O
a O
cup O

tea O

Job S-PERSON

lately O

" O
It's O
perhaps O
as O
well O

more O

the O
night O

alone O

said O
Sophy S-PERSON
, O
as O
if O
a O
new O
idea O
were O
receiving O
strength O
in O
her O
mind O

" O
Do O
you O
think O
Harry S-PERSON
means O
any O
thing O
by O
his O
attention O

" O
asked O
Helen S-PERSON

" O
Nay O
, O
I O
do O
not O
know O
any O
thing O
more O

you O
do O

can O
only O

What O
do O
you O
think O
, O
Helen S-PERSON
? O
" O
" O
Harry S-PERSON
always O
likes O
to O
be O
of O
consequence O
to O
the O
belle O
of O
the O
room O
. O
If O
one S-CARDINAL
girl O
is O
more O
admired O
than O
another O
, O
he O
likes O
to O
flutter O
about O
her O
, O
and O
seem O
to O
be O
on O
intimate O
terms O
with O
her O

That O
is O
his O
way O

I O
have O
not O
noticed O
any O
thing O
beyond O
that O
in O
his O
manner O
to O
Jane B-PERSON
Richardson E-PERSON

" O
" O
But O
I O
don't O
think O
she O
knows O
it's O
only O
his O
way O
. O
Just O
watch O
her O
the O
next O
time O
we O
meet O
her O
when O
Harry S-PERSON
is O
there O
, O
and O
see O
how O
she O
crimsons O
, O
and O
looks O
another O
way O
when O
she O
feels O
he O
is O
coming O
up O
to O
her O
. O
I O
think O
he O
sees O
it O
, O
too O
, O

I O
think O
he O
is O
pleased O
with O
it O
. O
" O
" O
I O
dare O
say O
Harry S-PERSON
would O
like O
well O
enough O
to O
turn O
the O
head O
of O
such O
a O
lovely O
girl O
as O
Jane B-PERSON
Richardson E-PERSON
. O
But O
I'm O
not O
convinced O
that O
he O
is O
in O
love O
, O
whatever O
she O
may O
be O
. O
" O
" O
Well O
, O
then O
! O
" O
said O
Sophy S-PERSON
, O
indignantly O
, O
" O
though O
it O
is O
our O
own O
brother O
, O
I O
do O
think O
he O
is O
behaving O
very O
wrongly O
. O
The O
more O
I O
think O
of O
it O
the O
more O
sure O
I O
am O
that O
she O
thinks O
he O
means O
something O
, O

that O
he O
intends O
her O
to O
think O
so O
. O
And O
then O
, O
when O
he O
leaves O
off O
paying O
her O
attention O
— O
" O
" O
Which O
will O
be O
as O
soon O
as O
a O
prettier O
girl O
makes O
her O
appearance O

Helen S-PERSON

" O
As O
soon O

he O

off O

resumed O
Sophy S-PERSON

" O
she O
will O
have O
many O
and O
many O
a O
heart O

ache O

then O
she O
will O
harden O
herself O
into O
being O
a O
flirt O
, O
a O
feminine O
flirt O

Poor O
girl O
! O
" O
" O
I O
don't O
like O
to O
hear O
you O
speak O
so O
of O
Harry S-PERSON

said O
Amy S-PERSON
, O
looking O
up O
at O
Sophy S-PERSON

" O

I O
don't O
like O

him O
dearly O

He O
is O
a O
good O

kind O
brother O

I O
do O
think O
him O
vain O

I O

hardly O
knows O
the O
misery O
, O
the O
crimes O
, O
to O
which O
indulged O
vanity O
may O
lead O
him O

" O
Helen S-PERSON
yawned O
. O
" O
Oh O
! O
do O
you O

may O
ring O

said O
the O
more O
energetic O
Sophy S-PERSON

pulling O
the O
bell O
with O
some O
determination O
. O
" O
Tea O
directly O
, O
Parker S-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
authoritatively O
, O
as O
the O
man O
entered O
the O
room O
. O
She O
was O
too O
little O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
reading O
expressions O
on O
the O
faces O
of O
others O
to O
notice O
Parker's S-PERSON
countenance O
. O
Yet O
it O
was O
striking O
. O
It O
was O
blanched O
to O
a O
dead O
whiteness O
| | O
the O
lips O
compressed O
as O
if O
to O
keep O
within O
some O
tale O
of O
horror O
| | O
the O
eyes O
distended O
and O
unnatural O
. O
It O
was O
a O
terror O
- O
stricken O
face O
. O
The O
girls O
began O
to O
put O
away O
their O
music O
and O
books O
, O
in O
preparation O
for O
tea O
. O
The O
door O
slowly O
opened O
again O
, O
and O
this O
time O
it O
was O
the O
nurse O

entered O

I O
call O
her O
nurse O

for O
such O
had O
been O
her O
office O
in O
by O
- O
gone O
days O
, O
though O
now O
she O
held O
rather O
an O
anomalous O
situation O
in O
the O
family O
. O
Seamstress O
, O
attendant O
on O
the O
young O
ladies O

keeper O

the O
stores O

only O
" O
Nurse O
" O
was O
still O
her O
name O
. O
She O
had O
lived O
longer O
with O
them O
than O
any O
other O
servant O
, O
and O
to O
her O
their O
manner O
was O
far O
less O
haughty O
than O
to O
the O
other O
domestics O
. O
She O
occasionally O
came O
into O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
to O
look O
for O
things O
belonging O
to O
their O
father O
or O
mother O
, O
so O
it O
did O
not O
excite O
any O
surprise O
when O
she O
advanced O
into O
the O
room O
. O
They O
went O
on O
arranging O
their O
various O
articles O
of O
employment O
. O
She O
wanted O
them O
to O
look O
up O
. O
She O
wanted O
them O
to O
read O
something O
in O
her O
face O
— O
her O
face O
so O
full O
of O
woe O
, O
of O
horror O
. O
But O
they O
went O
on O
without O
taking O
any O
notice O
. O
She O
coughed O
| | O
not O
a O
natural O
cough O
| | O
but O
one O
of O
those O
coughs O
which O
ask O
so O
plainly O
for O
remark O
. O
" O
Dear O
nurse O
, O
what O
is O
the O
matter O

you O
well O

Sophy S-PERSON

quickly O
. O
" O

, O
speak O

nurse O

said O
they O
all O
, O
as O
they O
saw O
her O
efforts O
to O
articulate O
, O
choked O
by O
the O
convulsive O
rising O
in O
her O
throat O
. O
They O
clustered O
round O
her O
with O
eager O
faces O
, O
catching O
a O
glimpse O
of O
some O
terrible O
truth O
to O
be O
revealed O
. O
" O
My O
dear O
young O
ladies O
! O
my O
dear O
girls O

she O
gasped O
out O
at O
length O
, O

then O
she O
burst O
into O
tears O
. O
" O
Oh O
! O
do O
tell O
us O
what O
it O
is O

one O

" O

better O

" O
My O
children O

" O
Brought O
home O
— O
brought O
home O

how O
? O
" O
Instinctively O
they O
sank O
their O
voices O
to O
a O
whisper O
| | O
but O
a O
fearful O
whisper O
it O
was O
. O
In O
the O
same O
low O
tone O
, O
as O
if O
afraid O
lest O
the O
walls O
, O
the O
furniture O
, O
the O
inanimate O
things O

told O
of O

answered O
, O
" O
Dead O
! O
" O
Amy S-PERSON
clutched O
her O
nurse's O
arm O
, O
and O
fixed O
her O
eyes O
on O
her O
as O
if O

such O

tale O
could O
be O
true O

when O
she O
read O
its O
confirmation O
in O
those O
sad O
, O
mournful O
, O
unflinching O
eyes O

she O
sank O
, O
without O
word O
or O
sound O
, O
down O
in O
a O
faint O
upon O
the O
floor O
. O
One S-CARDINAL
sister O
sat O
down O
on O
an O
ottoman O
, O
and O
covered O
her O
face O
, O
to O
try O
and O
realise O
it O
. O
That O
was O
Sophy S-PERSON
. O
Helen S-PERSON
threw O
herself O
on O
the O
sofa O
, O
and O
burying O
her O
head O
in O
the O
pillows O
, O
tried O
to O
stifle O
the O
screams O
and O
moans O
which O
shook O
her O
frame O
. O
The O
nurse O
stood O
silent O
. O
She O
had O
not O
told O
all O

" O
Tell O
me O
, O
" O
said O
Sophy S-PERSON
, O
looking O
up O
, O
and O
speaking O
in O
a O
hoarse O
voice O
, O
which O
told O
of O
the O
inward O
pain O

" O
tell O
me O

her O
voice O

shrillness O

to O
her O
feet O

Helen S-PERSON
lifted O
herself O
up O

with O
breathless O
waiting O

ten B-TIME

looked O
so O
well O

are O
you O
sure O

went O
towards O
the O
door O

laid O
her O
hand O
on O
her O
arm O

her O
face O

her O
eyes O

moved O

Sophy S-PERSON
went O
on O
with O
the O
motion O
of O
her O
lips O

twitching O
them O
almost O
convulsively O

worked O
involuntarily O

nurse O
left O
the O

almost O
immediately O
brought O
back O
some O
sal O

water O

drank O
it O
eagerly O

gave O
one S-CARDINAL

two S-CARDINAL
deep O
gasps O

in O
the O
dining O
- O
room O
, O
and O
the O
men O
are O
waiting O
to O
speak O
to O
him O
. O
" O
Sophy S-PERSON
went O
mechanically O
to O
the O
dining O
- O
room O
door O
. O
" O
Oh O
! O
I O
cannot O
go O
in O
. O
I O
cannot O
tell O
him O
. O
What O
must O
I O
say O
? O
" O
" O
I'll O
come O
with O
you O
, O
Miss O
Sophy S-PERSON

Break O
it O
to O
him O
by O
degrees O
. O
" O
" O
I O
can't O
, O
nurse O
. O
My O
head O
throbs O
so O
, O
I O
shall O
be O
sure O
to O
say O
the O
wrong O
thing O
. O
" O
However O
, O
she O
opened O
the O
door O
. O
There O
sat O
her O
father O
, O
the O
shaded O
light O
of O
the O
candle O
- O
lamp O
falling O
upon O
, O
and O
softening O
his O
marked O
features O
, O
while O
his O
snowy O
hair O
contrasted O
well O
with O
the O
deep O
crimson O
morocco O
of O
the O
chair O
. O
The O
newspaper O
he O
had O
been O
reading O
had O
dropped O
on O
the O
carpet O
by O
his O
side O
. O
He O
breathed O
regularly O
and O
deeply O
. O
At O
that O
instant O
the O
words O
of O
Mrs. O
Hemans's S-PERSON
song O
came O
full O
into O
Sophy's S-PERSON
mind O
. O
" O
Ye O
know O
not O
what O
ye O
do O
, O
That O
call O
the O
slumberer O
back O
From O
the O
realms O
unseen O
by O
you O
, O
To O
life's O
dim O
, O
weary O
track O
. O
" O
But O
this O
life's O
track O
would O
be O
to O
the O
bereaved O
father O
something O
more O
than O
dim O
and O
weary O
, O
hereafter O
. O
" O
Papa S-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
softly O
. O
He O
did O
not O
stir O
. O
" O
Papa S-PERSON
! O
" O
she O
exclaimed O
, O
somewhat O
louder O
. O
He O
started O
up O
, O
half O
awake O
. O
" O
Tea O
is O
ready O
, O
is O
it O
? O
" O
and O
he O
yawned O
. O
" O
No O
! O
papa O
, O
but O
something O
very O
dreadful O
— O
very O
sad O
, O
has O
happened O
! O
" O
He O
was O
gaping O
so O
loud O
that O
he O
did O
not O
catch O
the O
words O
she O
uttered O
, O
and O
did O
not O
see O
the O
expression O
of O
her O
face O
. O
" O
Master O
Henry S-PERSON
is O
not O
come O
back O
, O
" O
said O
nurse O
. O
Her O
voice O
, O
heard O
in O
unusual O
speech O
to O
him O
, O
arrested O
his O
attention O
, O
and O
rubbing O
his O
eyes O
, O
he O
looked O
at O
the O
servant O
. O
" O
Harry S-PERSON
! O
oh O
no O
! O
he O
had O
to O
attend O
a O
meeting O
of O
the O
masters O
about O
these O
cursed O
turn O
- O
outs O

I O
don't O
expect O
him O
yet O
. O
What O
are O
you O
looking O
at O
me O
so O
strangely O
for O
, O
Sophy S-PERSON
? O
" O
" O
Oh O
, O
papa O
, O
Harry S-PERSON
is O
come O
back O

said O
she O
, O
bursting O
into O
tears O
. O
" O
What O
do O
you O
mean O
? O
" O
said O
he O
, O
startled O
into O
an O
impatient O
consciousness O
that O
something O
was O
wrong O
. O
" O
One S-CARDINAL
of O
you O
says O

is O
not O

the O
other O
says O
he O

Now O
that's O
nonsense O
! O
Tell O
me O
at O
once O
what's O
the O
matter O

Did O
he O
go O
on O
horseback O
to O
town O
? O
Is O
he O
thrown O

Speak O
, O
child O

can't O
you O
? O
" O
" O
No O
! O
he's O
not O
been O
thrown O

said O
Sophy S-PERSON
, O
sadly O
. O
" O
But O
he's O
badly O
hurt O
, O
" O
put O
in O
the O
nurse O

desirous O
to O
be O
drawing O
his O
anxiety O
to O
a O
point O

Where O

How O
? O
Have O
you O
sent O
for O

" O
said O
he O
, O
hastily O
rising O
, O
as O
if O
to O
leave O
the O
room O
. O
" O
Yes O
, O
papa O
, O
we've O
sent O
for O

I'm O
afraid O

I O
believe O
it's O
of O
no O

" O
He O
looked O
at O
her O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
and O
in O
her O
face O
he O
read O
the O
truth O
. O
His O
son O
, O
his O
only O
son O
, O
was O
dead O
. O
He O
sank O
back O
in O
his O
chair O
, O
and O
hid O
his O
face O
in O
his O
hands O
, O
and O
bowed O
his O
head O
upon O
the O
table O
. O
The O
strong O
mahogany O
dining O
- O
table O
shook O
and O
rattled O
under O
his O
agony O
. O
Sophy S-PERSON
went O
and O
put O
her O
arms O
round O
his O
bowed O
neck O
. O
" O
Go O
! O
you O
are O
not O
Harry S-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
he O

but O
the O
action O
roused O
him O
. O
" O
Where O
is O
he O
? O
where O
is O
the O
— O
" O
said O
he O
, O
with O
his O
strong O
face O
set O
into O
the O
lines O
of O
anguish O
, O
by O
two B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
of O
such O
intense O
woe O
. O
" O
In O
the O
servants' O
hall O
, O
" O
said O
nurse O
. O
" O
Two S-CARDINAL
policemen O
and O
another O
man O
brought O
him O
home O
. O
They O
would O
be O
glad O
to O
speak O
to O
you O
when O
you O
are O
able O
, O
sir O

" O
" O
I O
am O
able O
now O

" O
replied O
he O
. O
At O
first S-ORDINAL
when O
he O
stood O
up O
, O
he O
tottered O
. O
But O
steadying O
himself O
, O
he O
walked O
, O
as O
firmly O
as O
a O
soldier O
on O
drill O
, O
to O
the O
door O
. O
Then O
he O
turned O
back O
and O
poured O
out O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
from O
the O
decanter O
which O
yet O
remained O
on O
the O
table O
. O
His O
eye O
caught O
the O
wine O
- O
glass O
which O
Harry S-PERSON
had O
used O
but O
two B-TIME
or I-TIME
three I-TIME
hours E-TIME
before O
. O
He O
sighed O
a O
long O
quivering O
sigh O
. O
And O
then O
mastering O
himself O
again O
, O
he O
left O
the O
room O
. O
" O
You O
had O
better O
go O
back O
to O
your O
sisters O

said O
nurse O

Miss O
Carson S-PERSON
went O
. O
She O
could O
not O
face O
death O
yet O
. O
The O
nurse O
followed O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
to O
the O
servants' O
hall O
. O
There O
, O
on O
their O
dinner O
- O
table O
, O
lay O
the O
poor O
dead O
body O
. O
The O
men O
who O
had O
brought O
it O
were O
sitting O
near O
the O
fire O
, O
while O
several O
of O
the O
servants O
stood O
round O
the O
table O
, O
gazing O
at O
the O
remains O
. O
The O
remains O
! O
One S-CARDINAL
or O
two S-CARDINAL
were O
crying O
| | O
one S-CARDINAL
or O
two S-CARDINAL
were O
whispering O
| | O
awed O
into O
a O
strange O
stillness O
of O
voice O
and O
action O
by O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
dead O
. O
When O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
came O
in O
they O
all O
drew O
back O
and O
looked O
at O
him O
with O
the O
reverence O
due O
to O
sorrow O
. O
He O
went O
forward O
and O
gazed O
long O
and O
fondly O
on O
the O
calm O
, O
dead O
face O
| | O
then O
he O
bent O
down O
and O
kissed O
the O
lips O
yet O
crimson O
with O
life O
. O
The O
policemen O
had O
advanced O
and O
stood O
ready O
to O
be O
questioned O
. O
But O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
the O
old O
man's O
mind O
could O
only O
take O
in O
the O
idea O
of O
death O
| | O
slowly O
, O
slowly O
came O
the O
conception O
of O
violence O
, O
of O
murder O
. O
" O
How O
did O
he O
die O
? O
" O
he O
groaned O
forth O
. O
The O
policemen O
looked O
at O
each O
other O
. O
Then O
one O
began O
, O
and O
stated O
that O
having O
heard O
the O
report O
of O
a O
gun O
in O
Turner B-FAC
Street E-FAC
, O
he O
had O
turned O
down O
that O
way O
( O
a O
lonely O
, O
unfrequented O
way O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
knew O
, O
but O
a O
short O
cut O
to O
his O
garden O
- O
door O
, O
of O
which O
Harry S-PERSON
had O
a O
key O
) O
| | O
that O
as O
he O
( O
the O
policeman O
) O
came O
nearer O
, O
he O
had O
heard O
footsteps O
as O
of O
a O
man O
running O
away O
| | O
but O
the O
evening O
was O
so O
dark O
( O
the O
moon O
not O
having O
yet O
risen O
) O
that O
he O
could O
see O
no O
one B-QUANTITY
twenty I-QUANTITY
yards E-QUANTITY
off O
. O
That O
he O
had O
even O
been O
startled O
when O
close O
to O
the O
body O
by O
seeing O
it O
lying O
across O
the O
path O
at O
his O
feet O
. O
That O
he O
had O
sprung O
his O
rattle O
| | O
and O
when O
another O
policeman O
came O
up O
, O
by O
the O
light O
of O
the O
lantern O
they O
had O
discovered O
who O
it O
was O
that O
had O
been O
killed O
. O
That O
they O
believed O
him O
to O
be O
dead O
when O
they O
first S-ORDINAL
took O
him O
up O
, O
as O
he O
had O
never O
moved O
, O
spoken O
, O
or O
breathed O
. O
That O
intelligence O
of O
the O
murder O
had O
been O
sent O
to O
the O
superintendent O
, O
who O
would O
probably O
soon O
be O
here O
. O
That O
two S-CARDINAL
or O
three S-CARDINAL
policemen O
were O
still O
about O
the O
place O
where O
the O
murder O
was O
committed O
, O
seeking O
out O
for O
some O
trace O
of O
the O
murderer O
. O
Having O
said O
this O
, O
they O
stopped O
speaking O
. O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
had O
listened O
attentively O
, O
never O
taking O
his O
eyes O
off O
the O
dead O
body O
. O
When O
they O
had O
ended O
, O
he O
said O
, O
" O
Where O
was O
he O
shot O
? O
" O
They O
lifted O
up O
some O
of O
the O
thick O
chestnut O
curls O
, O
and O
showed O
a O
blue O
spot O
( O
you O
could O
hardly O
call O
it O
a O
hole O
, O
the O
flesh O
had O
closed O
so O
much O
over O
it O
) O
in O
the O
left O
temple O
. O
A O
deadly O
aim O
! O
And O
yet O
it O
was O
so O
dark O
a O
night O
! O
" O
He O
must O
have O
been O
close O
upon O
him O
, O
" O
said O
one S-CARDINAL
policeman O
. O
" O
And O
have O
had O
him O
between O
him O
and O
the O
sky O
, O
" O
added O
the O
other O
. O
There O
was O
a O
little O
commotion O
at O
the O
door O
of O
the O
room O
, O
and O
there O
stood O
poor O
Mrs. O
Carson S-PERSON
, O
the O
mother O
. O
She O
had O
heard O
unusual O
noises O
in O
the O
house O
, O
and O
had O
sent O
down O
her O
maid O
( O
much O
more O
a O
companion O
to O
her O
than O
her O
highly O
- O
educated O
daughters O
) O
to O
discover O
what O
was O
going O
on O
. O
But O
the O
maid O
either O
forgot O
, O
or O
dreaded O
, O
to O
return O
| | O
and O
with O
nervous O
impatience O
Mrs. O
Carson S-PERSON
came O
down O
herself O
, O
and O
had O
traced O
the O
hum O
and O
buzz O
of O
voices O
to O
the O
servants' O
hall O
. O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
turned O
round O
. O
But O
he O
could O
not O
leave O
the O
dead O
for O
any O
one S-CARDINAL
living O
. O
" O
Take O
her O
away O
, O
nurse O
. O
It O
is O
no O
sight O
for O
her O
. O
Tell O
Miss O
Sophy S-PERSON
to O
go O
to O
her O
mother O
. O
" O
His O
eyes O
were O
again O
fixed O
on O
the O
dead O
face O
of O
his O
son O
. O
Presently O
Mrs. O
Carson's S-PERSON
hysterical O
cries O
were O
heard O
all O
over O
the O
house O
. O
Her O
husband O
shuddered O
at O
the O
outward O
expression O
of O
the O
agony O
which O
was O
rending O
his O
heart O
. O
Then O
the O
police O
superintendent O
came O
, O
and O
after O
him O
the O
doctor O
. O
The O
latter O
went O
through O
all O
the O
forms O
of O
ascertaining O
death O
, O
without O
uttering O
a O
word O
, O
and O
when O
at O
the O
conclusion O
of O
the O
operation O
of O
opening O
a O
vein O
, O
from O
which O
no O
blood O
flowed O
, O
he O
shook O
his O
head O
, O
all O
present O
understood O
the O
confirmation O
of O
their O
previous O
belief O
. O
The O
superintendent O
asked O
to O
speak O
to O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
in O
private O
. O
" O
It O
was O
just O
what O
I O
was O
going O
to O
request O
of O
you O
, O
" O
answered O
he O
| | O
so O
he O
led O
the O
way O
into O
the O
dining O
- O
room O
, O
with O
the O
wine O
- O
glass O
still O
on O
the O
table O
. O
The O
door O
was O
carefully O
shut O
, O
and O
both O
sat O
down O
, O
each O
apparently O
waiting O
for O
the O
other O
to O
begin O
. O
At O
last O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
spoke O
. O
" O
You O
probably O
have O
heard O
that O
I O
am O
a O
rich O
man O
. O
" O
The O
superintendent O
bowed O
in O
assent O
. O
" O
Well O
, O
sir O
, O
half O
— O
nay O
, O
if O
necessary O
, O
the O
whole O
of O
my O
fortune O
I O
will O
give O
to O
have O
the O
murderer O
brought O
to O
the O
gallows O
. O
" O
" O
Every O
exertion O
, O
you O
may O
be O
sure O
, O
sir O
, O
shall O
be O
used O
on O
our O
part O
| | O
but O
probably O
offering O
a O
handsome O
reward O
might O
accelerate O
the O
discovery O
of O
the O
murderer O
. O
But O
what O
I O
wanted O
particularly O
to O
tell O
you O
, O
sir O
, O
is O
that O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
my O
men O
has O
already O
got O
some O
clue O
, O
and O
that O
another O
( O
who O
accompanied O
me O
here O
) O
has O
within O
this O
quarter O
of O
an O
hour O
found O
a O
gun O
in O
the O
field O
which O
the O
murderer O
crossed O
, O
and O
which O
he O
probably O
threw O
away O
when O
pursued O
, O
as O
encumbering O
his O
flight O
. O
I O
have O
not O
the O
smallest O
doubt O
of O
discovering O
the O
murderer O
. O
" O
" O
What O
do O
you O
call O
a O
handsome O
reward O
? O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
. O
" O
Well O
, O
sir O
, O
three S-CARDINAL
, O
or O
five B-QUANTITY
hundred I-QUANTITY
pounds E-QUANTITY
is O
a O
munificent O
reward O
: O
more O
than O
will O
probably O
be O
required O
as O
a O
temptation O
to O
any O
accomplice O
. O
" O
" O
Make O
it O
a B-CARDINAL
thousand E-CARDINAL
, O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
, O
decisively O
. O
" O
It's O
the O
doing O
of O
those O
damned O
turn O
- O
outs O
. O
" O
" O
I O
imagine O
not O
, O
" O
said O
the O
superintendent O
. O
" O
Some B-DATE
days I-DATE
ago E-DATE
the O
man O
I O
was O
naming O
to O
you O
before O
, O
reported O
to O
the O
inspector O
when O
he O
came O
on O
his O
beat O
, O
that O
he O
had O
had O
to O
separate O
your O
son O
from O
a O
young O
man O
, O
who O
by O
his O
dress O
he O
believed O
to O
be O
employed O
in O
a O
foundry O
| | O
that O
the O
man O
had O
thrown O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
down O
, O
and O
seemed O
inclined O
to O
proceed O
to O
more O
violence O
, O
when O
the O
policeman O
came O
up O
and O
interfered O
. O
Indeed O
, O
my O
man O
wished O
to O
give O
him O
in O
charge O
for O
an O
assault O
, O
but O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
would O
not O
allow O
that O
to O
be O
done O
. O
" O
" O
Just O
like O
him O
! O
— O
noble O
fellow O
! O
" O
murmured O
the O
father O
. O
" O
But O
after O
your O
son O
had O
left O
, O
the O
man O
made O
use O
of O
some O
pretty O
strong O
threats O
. O
And O
it's O
rather O
a O
curious O
coincidence O
that O
this O
scuffle O
took O
place O
in O
the O
very O
same O
spot O
where O
the O
murder O
was O
committed O
| | O
in O
Turner B-FAC
Street E-FAC
. O
" O
There O
was O
some O
one O
knocking O
at O
the O
door O
of O
the O
room O
. O
It O
was O
Sophy S-PERSON
, O
who O
beckoned O
her O
father O
out O
, O
and O
then O
asked O
him O
, O
in O
an O
awe O
- O
struck O
whisper O
, O
to O
come O
up O
- O
stairs O
and O
speak O
to O
her O
mother O
. O
" O
She O
will O
not O
leave O
Harry S-PERSON
, O
and O
talks O
so O
strangely O
. O
Indeed O
— O
indeed O
— O
papa O
, O
I O
think O
she O
has O
lost O
her O
senses O
. O
" O
And O
the O
poor O
girl O
sobbed O
bitterly O
. O
" O
Where O
is O
she O
? O
" O
asked O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
. O
" O
In O
his O
room O
. O
" O
They O
went O
up O
stairs O
rapidly O
and O
silently O
. O
It O
was O
a O
large O
, O
comfortable O
bedroom O
| | O
too O
large O
to O
be O
well O
lighted O
by O
the O
flaring O
, O
flickering O
kitchen O
- O
candle O
which O
had O
been O
hastily O
snatched O
up O
, O
and O
now O
stood O
on O
the O
dressing O
- O
table O
. O
On O
the O
bed O
, O
surrounded O
by O
its O
heavy O
, O
pall O
- O
like O
green O
curtains O
, O
lay O
the O
dead O
son O
. O
They O
had O
carried O
him O
up O
, O
and O
laid O
him O
down O
, O
as O
tenderly O
as O
though O
they O
feared O
to O
waken O
him O
| | O
and O
, O
indeed O
, O
it O
looked O
more O
like O
sleep O
than O
death O
, O
so O
very O
calm O
and O
full O
of O
repose O
was O
the O
face O
. O
You O
saw O
, O
too O
, O
the O
chiselled O
beauty O
of O
the O
features O
much O
more O
perfectly O
than O
when O
the O
brilliant O
colouring O
of O
life O
had O
distracted O
your O
attention O
. O
There O
was O
a O
peace O
about O
him O
which O
told O
that O
death O
had O
come O
too O
instantaneously O
to O
give O
any O
previous O
pain O
. O
In O
a O
chair O
, O
at O
the O
head O
of O
the O
bed O
, O
sat O
the O
mother O
, O
— O
smiling O
. O
She O
held O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
hands O
( O
rapidly O
stiffening O
, O
even O
in O
her O
warm O
grasp O
) O
, O
and O
gently O
stroked O
the O
back O
of O
it O
, O
with O
the O
endearing O
caress O
she O
had O
used O
to O
all O
her O
children O
when O
young O
. O
" O
I O
am O
glad O
you O
are O
come O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
looking O
up O
at O
her O
husband O
, O
and O
still O
smiling O
. O
" O
Harry S-PERSON
is O
so O
full O
of O
fun O
, O
he O
always O
has O
something O
new O
to O
amuse O
us O
with O

and O
now O
he O
pretends O
he O
is O
asleep O
, O
and O
that O
we O
can't O
waken O
him O
. O
Look O
! O
he O
is O
smiling O
now O

he O
hears O
I O
have O
found O
him O
out O

Look O

And O
, O
in O
truth O
, O
the O
lips O
, O
in O
the O
rest O
of O
death O
, O
did O
look O
as O
though O
they O
wore O
a O
smile O
, O
and O
the O
waving O
light O
of O
the O
unsnuffed O
candle O
almost O
made O
them O
seem O
to O
move O

" O
Look O
, O
Amy S-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
she O
to O
her O
youngest O
child O
, O
who O
knelt O
at O
her O
feet O
, O
trying O
to O
soothe O
her O
, O
by O
kissing O
her O
garments O

" O
Oh O
, O
he O
was O
always O
a O
rogue O
! O
You O
remember O
, O
don't O
you O
, O
love O
? O
how O
full O
of O
play O
he O
was O
as O
a O
baby O

hiding O
his O
face O
under O
my O
arm O
, O
when O
you O
wanted O
to O
play O
with O
him O

Always O
a O
rogue O

Harry S-PERSON
! O
" O
" O
We O
must O
get O
her O
away O
, O
sir O
, O
" O
said O
nurse O

" O
you O
know O
there O
is O
much O
to O
be O
done O
before O

" O
" O
I O
understand O
, O
nurse O
, O
" O
said O
the O
father O
, O
hastily O
interrupting O
her O
in O
dread O
of O
the O
distinct O
words O
which O
would O
tell O
of O
the O
changes O
of O
mortality O
. O
" O
Come O
, O
love O
, O
" O
said O
he O
to O
his O
wife O
. O
" O
I O
want O
you O
to O
come O
with O
me O

I O
want O
to O
speak O
to O
you O
down O

" O
" O
I'm O
coming O

she O
, O
rising O

" O
perhaps O
, O
after O
all O
, O
nurse O
, O
he's O
really O
tired O
, O
and O
would O
be O
glad O

sleep O

Don't O
let O
him O
get O
cold O

he O
feels O
rather O
chilly O

continued O
she O

after O
she O
had O
bent O
down O
, O
and O
kissed O
the O
pale O
lips O

Her O
husband O
put O
his O
arm O
round O
her O
waist O
, O
and O
they O
left O
the O
room O
. O
Then O
the O
three S-CARDINAL
sisters O
burst O
into O
unrestrained O
wailings O
. O
They O
were O
startled O
into O
the O
reality O
of O
life O
and O
death O
. O
And O
yet O
, O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
shrieks O

moans O
, O
of O
shivering O
, O
and O
chattering O
of O
teeth O
, O
Sophy's S-PERSON
eye O
caught O
the O
calm O
beauty O
of O
the O
dead O

so O
calm O
amidst O
such O
violence O
, O
and O
she O
hushed O
her O
emotion O

" O
Come O

she O
to O
her O
sisters O

" O
nurse O
wants O
us O

go O

we O
ought O

mamma O

the O
man O

was O
talking O

I O
went O
for O
him O

wait O

she O
must O
not O
be O
left O

" O
Meanwhile O
, O
the O
superintendent O
had O
taken O
a O
candle O
, O
and O
was O
examining O
the O
engravings O
that O
hung O
round O
the O
dining O
- O
room O
. O
It O
was O
so O
common O
to O
him O
to O
be O
acquainted O
with O
crime O
, O
that O
he O
was O
far O
from O
feeling O
all O
his O
interest O
absorbed O
in O
the O
present O
case O
of O
violence O
, O

he O
could O
not O
help O
having O
much O
anxiety O
to O
detect O
the O
murderer O

He O
was O
busy O
looking O
at O
the O
only O
oil O

painting O
in O
the O
room O
( O
a O
youth O
of O
eighteen S-CARDINAL

so O

in O
a O
fancy O
dress O

, O
and O
conjecturing O
its O
identity O
with O
the O
young O
man O
so O
mysteriously O
dead O
, O
when O
the O
door O
opened O
, O
and O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
returned O
. O
Stern S-PERSON
as O
he O
had O
looked O
before O
leaving O
the O
room O

he O
looked O
far O
sterner O
now O
. O
His O
face O
was O
hardened O
into O
deep O

purposed O
wrath O

" O
I O
beg O
your O
pardon O
, O
sir O

for O
leaving O
you O

The O
superintendent O
bowed O
. O
They O
sat O
down O
, O
and O
spoke O
long O
together O
. O
One S-CARDINAL
by O
one S-CARDINAL
the O
policemen O
were O
called O
in O
, O
and O
questioned O
. O
All O
through O
the O
night O
there O
was O
bustle O
and O
commotion O
in O
the O
house O
. O
Nobody O
thought O
of O
going O
to O
bed O
. O
It O
seemed O
strange O
to O
Sophy S-PERSON
to O
hear O
nurse O
summoned O
from O
her O
mother's O
side O
to O
supper O
, O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
night O
, O
and O
still O
stranger O
that O
she O
could O
go O
. O
The O
necessity O
of O
eating O
and O
drinking O
seemed O
out O
of O
place O
in O
the O
house O
of O
death O

When O
night O
was O
passing O
into O
morning S-TIME
, O
the O
dining O
- O
room O
door O
opened O

two S-CARDINAL
persons' O
steps O
were O
heard O
along O
the O
hall O

The O
superintendent O
was O
leaving O
at O
last O
. O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
stood O
on O
the O
front O
door O

step O

feeling O
the O
refreshment O
of O
the O
cooler O
morning O
air O

seeing O
the O
starlight O
fade O
away O
into O
dawn O

" O

you O

" O
The O
policeman O
bowed O

no O
money O

The O
only O
purpose O

" O
Coleridge S-PERSON
. O
I O
left O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
on O
that O
same O
Thursday O
night O
which O
left O
its O
burden O
of O
woe O
at O
Mr. O
Carson's S-PERSON
threshold O
, O
haunted O
with O
depressing O
thoughts O
. O
All O
through O
the O
night O
she O
tossed O
restlessly O
about O
, O
trying O
to O
get O
quit O
of O
the O
ideas O
that O
harassed O
her O
, O
and O
longing O
for O
the O
light O
when O
she O
could O
rise O
, O
and O
find O
some O
employment O
. O
But O
just O
as O
dawn O
began O
to O
appear O
, O
she O
became O
more O
quiet O
, O
and O
fell O
into O
a O
sound O
heavy O
sleep O
, O
which O
lasted O
till O
she O
was O
sure O
it O
was O
late B-TIME
in I-TIME
the I-TIME
morning E-TIME
by O
the O
full O
light O
that O
shone O
in O
. O
She O
dressed O
hastily O
, O
and O
heard O
the O
neighbouring O
church O
- O
clock O
strike O
eight S-CARDINAL
. O
It O
was O
far O
too O
late O
to O
do O
as O
she O
had O
planned O
( O
after O
inquiring O
how O
Alice S-PERSON
was O
, O
to O
return O
and O
tell O
Margaret S-PERSON
) O
, O
and O
she O
accordingly O
went O
in O
to O
inform O
the O
latter O
of O
her O
change O
of O
purpose O
, O
and O
the O
cause O
of O
it O

but O
on O
entering O
the O
house O
she O
found O
Job O
sitting O
alone O
, O
looking O
sad O
enough O
. O
She O
told O
him O
what O
she O
came O
for O
. O
" O
Margaret S-PERSON
, O
wench O
! O
why O
she's O

gone O
to O
Wilson's O
these B-TIME
two I-TIME
hours E-TIME
. O
Ay O
! O
sure O
, O
you O
did O
say O
last O
night O
you O
would O
go O

but O
she O
could O
na O
rest O
in O
her O
bed O
, O
so O
was O
off O
betimes O
this B-TIME
morning E-TIME
. O
" O
Mary S-PERSON
could O
do O
nothing O
but O
feel O
guilty O
of O
her O
long O
morning O
nap O
, O
and O
hasten O
to O
follow O
Margaret's S-PERSON
steps O
| | O
for O
late O
as O
it O
was O
, O
she O
felt O
she O
could O
not O
settle O
well O
to O
her O
work O
, O
unless O
she O
learnt O
how O
kind O
good O
Alice B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
was O
going O
on O
. O
So O
, O
eating O
her O
crust O
- O
of O
- O
bread O
breakfast O
, O
she O
passed O
rapidly O
along O
the O
streets O
. O
She O
remembered O
afterwards O
the O
little O
groups O
of O
people O
she O
had O
seen O
, O
eagerly O
hearing O
, O
and O
imparting O
news O
| | O
but O
at O
the O
time O
her O
only O
care O
was O
to O
hasten O
on O
her O
way O
, O
in O
dread O
of O
a O
reprimand O
from O
Miss O
Simmonds S-PERSON
. O
She O
went O
into O
the O
house O
at O
Jane B-PERSON
Wilson's E-PERSON
, O
her O
heart O
at O
the O
instant O
giving O
a O
strange O
knock O
, O
and O
sending O
the O
rosy O
flush O
into O
her O
face O
, O
at O
the O
thought O
that O
Jem S-PERSON
might O
possibly O
be O
inside O
the O
door O
. O
But O
I O
do O
assure O
you O
, O
she O
had O
not O
thought O
of O
it O
before O
. O
Impatient O
and O
loving O
as O
she O
was O
, O
her O
solicitude O
about O
Alice S-PERSON
on O
that O
hurried O
morning O
had O
not O
been O
mingled O
with O
any O
thought O
of O
him O
. O
Her O
heart O
need O
not O
have O
leaped O
, O
her O
colour O
need O
not O
have O
rushed O
so O
painfully O
to O
her O
cheeks O
, O
for O
he O
was O
not O
there O
. O
There O
was O
the O
round O
table O
, O
with O
a O
cup O
and O
saucer O
, O
which O
had O
evidently O
been O
used O
, O
and O
there O
was O
Jane B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
sitting O
on O
the O
other O
side O
, O
crying O
quietly O
, O
while O
she O
ate O
her O
breakfast O
with O
a O
sort O
of O
unconscious O
appetite O
. O
And O
there O
was O
Mrs. O
Davenport S-PERSON
washing O
away O
at O
a O
night O
- O
cap O
or O
so O
, O
which O
, O
by O
their O
simple O
, O
old O
- O
world O
make O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
knew O
at O
a O
glance O
were O
Alice's S-PERSON
. O
But O
nothing O
— O
no O
one O
else O
. O
Alice S-PERSON
was O
much O
the O
same O
, O
or O
rather O
better O
of O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
, O
they O
told O
her O
| | O
at O
any O
rate O
she O
could O
speak O
, O
though O
it O
was O
sad O
rambling O
talk O
. O
Would O
Mary S-PERSON
like O
to O
see O
her O
? O
Of O
course O
she O
would O
. O
Many O
are O
interested O
by O
seeing O
their O
friends O
under O
the O
new O
aspect O
of O
illness O
| | O
and O
among O
the O
poor O
there O
is O
no O
wholesome O
fear O
of O
injury O
or O
excitement O
to O
restrain O
this O
wish O
. O
So O
Mary S-PERSON
went O
up O
- O
stairs O
, O
accompanied O
by O
Mrs. O
Davenport S-PERSON
, O
wringing O
the O
suds O
off O
her O
hands O
, O
and O
speaking O
in O
a O
loud O
whisper O
far O
more O
audible O
than O
her O
usual O
voice O
. O
" O
I O
mun O
be O
hastening O
home O
, O
but O
I'll O
come O
again O
to O
- O
night O
, O
time O
enough O
to O
iron O
her O
cap O

' O
twould O
be O
a O
sin O
and O
a O
shame O
if O
we O
let O
her O
go O
dirty O
now O
she's O
ill O
, O
when O
she's O
been O
so O
rare O
and O
clean O
all O
her O
life O
- O
long O
. O
But O
she's O
sadly O
forsaken O
, O
poor O
thing O
! O
She'll O
not O
know O
you O
, O
Mary S-PERSON

she O
knows O
none O
on O
us O
. O
" O
The O
room O
up O
- O
stairs O
held O
two S-CARDINAL
beds O
, O
one S-CARDINAL
superior O
in O
the O
grandeur O
of O
four S-CARDINAL
posts O
and O
checked O
curtains O
to O
the O
other O
, O
which O
had O
been O
occupied O
by O
the O
twins O
in O
their O
brief O
life O
- O
time O
. O
The O
smaller O
had O
been O
Alice's S-PERSON
bed O
since O
she O
had O
lived O
there O

but O
with O
the O
natural O
reverence O
to O
one O
" O
stricken O
of O
God O
and O
afflicted O
, O
" O
she O
had O
been O
installed O
since O
her O
paralytic O
stroke O
the O
evening O
before O
in O
the O
larger O

grander O
bed O

while O
Jane B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
had O
taken O
her O
short O
broken O
rest O
on O
the O
little O
pallet O
. O
Margaret S-PERSON
came O
forwards O
to O
meet O
her O
friend O
, O
whom O
she O
half O
expected O
, O
and O
whose O
step O
she O
knew O
. O
Mrs. O
Davenport S-PERSON
returned O
to O
her O
washing O
. O
The O
two S-CARDINAL
girls O
did O
not O
speak O
| | O
the O
presence O
of O
Alice S-PERSON
awed O
them O
into O
silence O
. O
There O
she O
lay O
with O
the O
rosy O
colour O
, O
absent O
from O
her O
face O
since O
the O
days O
of O
childhood O
, O
flushed O
once O
more O
into O
it O
by O
her O
sickness O
nigh O
unto O
death O
. O
She O
lay O
on O
the O
affected O
side O
, O
and O
with O
her O
other O
arm O
she O
was O
constantly O
sawing O
the O
air O
, O
not O
exactly O
in O
a O
restless O
manner O
, O
but O
in O
a O
monotonous O
, O
incessant O
way O
, O
very O
trying O
to O
a O
watcher O
. O
She O
was O
talking O
away O
, O
too O
, O
almost O
as O
constantly O
, O
in O
a O
low O
, O
indistinct O
tone O
. O
But O
her O
face O
, O
her O
profiled O
countenance O
, O
looked O
calm O
and O
smiling O
, O
even O
interested O
by O
the O
ideas O
that O
were O
passing O
through O
her O
clouded O
mind O
. O
" O
Listen O
! O
" O
said O
Margaret S-PERSON
, O
as O
she O
stooped O
her O
head O
down O
to O
catch O
the O
muttered O
words O
more O
distinctly O

Margaret S-PERSON
touched O
Mary's S-PERSON
hand O
, O
and O
the O
pressure O
in O

told O

we've O
gone O
on O
deceiving O
her O
. O
If O
we'd O
told O
her O
at O
first O
how O
it O
was O
— O
how O
sweet O
th' O
hawthorn O
smelt O
through O
the O
open O
church O
- O
door O
, O
and O
how O
we O
were O
on O
th' O
last O
bench O
in O
the O
aisle O
, O
and O
how O
it O
were O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
butterfly O
we'd O
seen O
this B-DATE
spring E-DATE
, O
and O
how O
it O
flew O
into O
th' O
very O
church O
itself O
| | O
oh O
! O
mother O
is O
so O
gentle O
, O
I O
wish O
we'd O
told O
her O
. O
I'll O
go O
to O
her O
next O
time O
she O
comes O
in O
sight O
, O
and O
say O
, O
' O
Mother O
, O
we O
were O
naughty O
last O
Sabbath O
. O
' O
" O
She O
stopped O
, O
and O
a O
few O
tears O
came O
stealing O
down O
the O
old O
withered O
cheek O
, O
at O
the O
thought O
of O
the O
temptation O
and O
deceit O
of O
her O
childhood O
. O
Surely O
, O
many O
sins O
could O
not O
have O
darkened O
that O
innocent O
child O
- O
like O
spirit O
since O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
found O
a O
red-spotted O
pocket O
- O
handkerchief O
, O
and O
put O
it O
into O
the O
hand O
which O
sought O
about O
for O
something O
to O
wipe O
away O
the O
trickling O
tears O
. O
She O
took O
it O
with O
a O
gentle O
murmur O
. O
" O
Thank O
you O
, O
mother O
. O
" O
Mary S-PERSON
pulled O
Margaret S-PERSON
away O
from O
the O
bed O
. O
" O
Don't O
you O
think O
she's O
happy O
, O
Margaret S-PERSON
? O
" O
" O
Ay O
! O
that O
I O
do O
, O
bless O
her O
. O
She O
feels O
no O
pain O
, O
and O
knows O
nought O
of O
her O
present O
state O
. O
Oh O
! O
that O
I O
could O
see O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
! O
I O
try O
and O
be O
patient O
with O
her O
afore O
me O
, O
but O
I'd O
give O
aught O
I O
have O
to O
see O
her O
, O
and O
see O
what O
she O
wants O
. O
I O
am O
so O
useless O
! O
I O
mean O
to O
stay O
here O
as O
long O
as O
Jane B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
is O
alone O
| | O
and O
I O
would O
fain O
be O
here O
all O
to O
- O
night O
, O
but O
— O
" O
" O
I'll O
come O
, O
" O
said O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
decidedly O
. O
" O
Mrs. O
Davenport S-PERSON
said O
she'd O
come O
again O
, O
but O
she's O
hard O
- O
worked O
all O
day O
— O
" O
" O
I'll O
come O
, O
" O
repeated O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
" O
Do O
! O
" O
said O
Margaret S-PERSON
, O
" O
and O
I'll O
be O
here O
till O
you O
come O
. O
May O
be O
, O
Jem S-PERSON
and O
you O
could O
take O
th' O
night O
between O
you O
, O
and O
Jane B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
might O
get O
a O
bit O
of O
sound O
sleep O
in O
his O
bed O
| | O
for O
she O
were O
up O
and O
down O
the O
better O
part O
of O
last O
night O
, O
and O
just O
when O
she O
were O
in O
a O
sound O
sleep O
this O
morning O
, O
between O
two S-CARDINAL
and O
three S-CARDINAL
, O
Jem S-PERSON
came O
home O
, O
and O
th' O
sound O
o' O
his O
voice O
roused O
her O
in O
a B-TIME
minute E-TIME
. O
" O
" O
Where O
had O
he O
been O
till O
that O
time O
o' O
night O
? O
" O
asked O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
" O
Nay O
! O
it O
were O
none O
of O
my O
business O
| | O
and O
, O
indeed O
, O
I O
never O
saw O
him O
till O
he O
came O
in O
here O
to O
see O
Alice S-PERSON
. O
He O
were O
in O
again O
this B-TIME
morning E-TIME
, O
and O
seemed O
sadly O
downcast O
. O
But O
you'll O
, O
may O
be O
, O
manage O
to O
comfort O
him O
to O
- O
night O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
Margaret S-PERSON
, O
smiling O
, O
while O
a O
ray O
of O
hope O
glimmered O
in O
Mary's S-PERSON
heart O
, O
and O
she O
almost O
felt O
glad O
, O
for O
an O
instant O
, O
of O
the O
occasion O
which O
would O
at O
last O
bring O
them O
together O
. O
Oh O
! O
happy O
night O
! O
when O
would O
it O
come O
? O
Many B-TIME
hours E-TIME
had O
yet O
to O
pass O
. O
Then O
she O
saw O
Alice S-PERSON
, O
and O
repented O
, O
with O
a O
bitter O
self O
- O
reproach O
. O
But O
she O
could O
not O
help O
having O
gladness O
in O
the O
depths O
of O
her O
heart O
, O
blame O
herself O
as O
she O
would O
. O
So O
she O
tried O
not O
to O
think O
, O
as O
she O
hurried O
along O
to O
Miss O
Simmonds S-PERSON
' O
, O
with O
a O
dancing O
step O
of O
lightness O
. O
She O
was O
late O
— O
that O
she O
knew O
she O
should O
be O
. O
Miss O
Simmonds S-PERSON
was O
vexed O
and O
cross O
. O
That O
also O
she O
had O
anticipated O
, O
but O
she O
had O
intended O
to O
smooth O
her O
raven O
down O
by O
extraordinary O
diligence O
and O
attention O
. O
But O
there O
was O
something O
about O
the O
girls O
she O
did O
not O
understand O
— O
had O
not O
anticipated O
. O
They O
stopped O
talking O
when O
she O
came O
in O
| | O
or O
rather O
, O
I O
should O
say O
, O
stopped O
listening O
, O
for O
Sally B-PERSON
Leadbitter E-PERSON
was O
the O
talker O
to O
whom O
they O
were O
hearkening O
with O
intense O
attention O
. O
At O
first O
they O
eyed O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
as O
if O
she O
had O
acquired O
some O
new O
interest O
to O
them O
, O
since O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
before E-DATE
. O
Then O
they O
began O
to O
whisper O
| | O
and O
, O
absorbed O
as O
Mary S-PERSON
had O
been O
in O
her O
own O
thoughts O
, O
she O
could O
not O
help O
becoming O
aware O
that O
it O
was O
of O
her O
they O
spoke O
. O
At O
last O
Sally B-PERSON
Leadbitter E-PERSON
asked O
Mary S-PERSON
if O
she O
had O
heard O
the O
news O
? O
" O
No O
! O
What O
news O
? O
" O
answered O
she O
. O
The O
girls O
looked O
at O
each O
other O
with O
gloomy O
mystery O
. O
Sally S-PERSON
went O
on O
. O
" O
Have O
you O
not O
heard O
that O
young O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
was O
murdered O
last B-TIME
night E-TIME
? O
" O
Mary's S-PERSON
lips O
could O
not O
utter O
a O
negative O
, O
but O
no O
one O
who O
looked O
at O
her O
pale O
and O
terror O
- O
stricken O
face O
could O
have O
doubted O
that O
she O
had O
not O
heard O
before O
of O
the O
fearful O
occurrence O
. O
Oh O
, O
it O
is O
terrible O
, O
that O
sudden O
information O
, O
that O
one O
you O
have O
known O
has O
met O
with O
a O
bloody O
death O
! O
You O
seem O
to O
shrink O
from O
the O
world O
where O
such O
deeds O
can O
be O
committed O
, O
and O
to O
grow O
sick O
with O
the O
idea O
of O
the O
violent O
and O
wicked O
men O
of O
earth O
. O
Much O
as O
Mary S-PERSON
had O
learned O
to O
dread O
him O
lately O
, O
now O
he O
was O
dead O
( O
and O
dead O
in O
such O
a O
manner O
) O
her O
feeling O
was O
that O
of O
oppressive O
sorrow O
for O
him O
. O
The O
room O
went O
round O
and O
round O
, O
and O
she O
felt O
as O
though O
she O
should O
faint O
| | O
but O
Miss O
Simmonds S-PERSON
came O
in O
, O
bringing O
a O
waft O
of O
fresher O
air O
as O
she O
opened O
the O
door O
, O
to O
refresh O
the O
body O
, O
and O
the O
certainty O
of O
a O
scolding O
for O
inattention O
to O
brace O
the O
sinking O
mind O
. O
She O
, O
too O
, O
was O
full O
of O
the O
morning's O
news O
. O
" O
Have O
you O
heard O
any O
more O
of O
this O
horrid O
affair O
, O
Miss O
Barton S-PERSON
? O
" O
asked O
she O
, O
as O
she O
settled O
to O
her O
work O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
tried O
to O
speak O
| | O
at O
first O
she O
could O
not O
, O
and O
when O
she O
succeeded O
in O
uttering O
a O
sentence O
, O
it O
seemed O
as O
though O
it O
were O
not O
her O
own O
voice O
that O
spoke O
. O
" O
No O
, O
ma'am O
, O
I O
never O
heard O
of O
it O
till O
this B-TIME
minute E-TIME
. O
" O
" O
Dear O
! O
that's O
strange O
, O
for O
every O
one O
is O
up O
about O
it O
. O
I O
hope O
the O
murderer O
will O
be O
found O
out O
, O
that O
I O
do O
. O
Such O
a O
handsome O
young O
man O
to O
be O
killed O
as O
he O
was O
. O
I O
hope O
the O
wretch O
that O
did O
it O
may O
be O
hanged O
as O
high O
as O
Haman S-PERSON
. O
" O
One S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
girls O
reminded O
them O
that O
the O
assizes O
came O
on O
next B-DATE
week E-DATE
. O
" O
Ay O
, O
" O
replied O
Miss O
Simmonds S-PERSON
, O
" O
and O
the O
milk O
- O
man O
told O
me O
they O
will O
catch O
the O
wretch O
, O
and O
have O
him O
tried O
and O
hung O
in O
less O
than O
a O
week O
. O
Serve O
him O
right O
, O
whoever O
he O
is O
. O
Such O
a O
handsome O
young O
man O
as O
he O
was O

" O
Then O
each O
began O
to O
communicate O
to O
Miss O
Simmonds S-PERSON
the O
various O
reports O
they O
had O
heard O
. O
Suddenly O
she O
burst O
out O
— O
" O
Miss O
Barton S-PERSON
! O
as O
I O
live O
, O
dropping O
tears O
on O

new O
silk O
gown O

! O
Don't O
you O
know O
they O
will O
stain O
, O
and O
make O
it O
shabby O
for O
ever O
? O
Crying O
like O
a O
baby O
, O
because O
a O
handsome O
young O
man O
meets O
with O
an O
untimely O
end O

For O
shame O
of O
yourself O
, O
miss O

Mind O
your O
character O
and O
your O
work O
if O
you O
please O

Or O
, O
if O
you O
must O
cry O
" O
( O
seeing O
her O
scolding O
rather O
increased O
the O
flow O
of O
Mary's O
tears O
, O
than O
otherwise O
) O
, O
" O
take O
this O
print O
to O
cry O
over O

That O
won't O
be O
marked O
like O
this O
beautiful O
silk O
, O
" O
rubbing O
it O
, O
as O
if O
she O
loved O
it O
, O
with O
a O
clean O
pocket O
- O
handkerchief O
, O
in O
order O
to O
soften O
the O
edges O
of O
the O
hard O
round O
drops O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
took O
the O
print O
, O
and O
naturally O
enough O
, O
having O
had O
leave O
given O
her O
to O
cry O
over O
it O
, O
rather O
checked O
the O
inclination O
to O
weep O
. O
Every O
body O
was O
full O
of O
the O
one S-CARDINAL
subject O
. O
The O
girl O
sent O
out O
to O
match O
silk O
, O
came O
back O
with O
the O
account O
gathered O
at O
the O
shop O
, O
of O
the O
coroner's O
inquest O
then O
sitting O
| | O
the O
ladies O
who O
called O
to O
speak O
about O
gowns O
first S-ORDINAL
began O
about O
the O
murder O
, O
and O
mingled O
details O
of O
that O
, O
with O
directions O
for O
their O
dresses O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
felt O
as O
though O
the O
haunting O
horror O
were O
a O
nightmare O
, O
a O
fearful O
dream O
, O
from O
which O
awakening O
would O
relieve O
her O
. O
The O
picture O
of O
the O
murdered O
body O
, O
far O
more O
ghastly O
than O
the O
reality O
, O
seemed O
to O
swim O
in O
the O
air O
before O
her O
eyes O
. O
Sally B-PERSON
Leadbitter E-PERSON
looked O
and O
spoke O
of O
her O
, O
almost O
accusingly O
, O
and O
made O
no O
secret O
now O
of O
Mary's S-PERSON
conduct O
, O
more O
blameable O
to O
her O
fellow O
- O
workwomen O
for O
its O
latter O
changeableness O
, O
than O
for O
its O
former O
giddy O
flirting O
. O
" O
Poor O
young O
gentleman O
, O
" O
said O
one O
, O
as O
Sally S-PERSON
recounted O
Mary's S-PERSON
last O
interview O
with O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
. O
" O
What O
a O
shame O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
another O
, O
looking O
indignantly O
at O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
" O
That's O
what O
I O
call O
regular O
jilting O
, O
" O
said O
a O
third S-ORDINAL
. O
" O
And O
he O
lying O
cold O
and O
bloody O
in O
his O
coffin O
now O
! O
" O
Mary S-PERSON
was O
more O
thankful O
than O
she O
could O
express O
, O
when O
Miss O
Simmonds S-PERSON
returned O
, O
to O
put O
a O
stop O
to O
Sally's S-PERSON
communications O
, O
and O
to O

temptation O

That B-TIME

the O
effect O

night's O
disturbed O
rest O

evinced O
in O
frequent O
droppings O
off O

by O

sister O

in O

bed O

side O

lulled O
by O
the O
incessant O
crooning O
of O
the O
invalid's O
feeble O
voice O
, O
she O
was O
startled O
by O

man O
speaking O
in O
the O
house O

wearied O

lustily O

" O
Missis O

missis O

" O
When O
Mrs. O

the O
intruder O

at O
once O
saw O
he O
was O
a O
stranger O
, O
a O
working O
- O
man O
, O
it O
might O
be O
a O
fellow O
- O
labourer O
with O
her O
son O
, O
for O
his O
dress O
was O
grimy O
enough O
for O
the O
supposition O
. O
He O
held O
a O
gun O
in O
his O
hand O
. O
" O
May O
I O
make O
bold O
to O
ask O
if O
this O
gun O
belongs O
to O
your O
son O

" O
She O
first S-ORDINAL
looked O
at O
the O
man O
, O
and O
then O
, O
weary O
and O
half O
asleep O
, O
not O
seeing O
any O
reason O
for O
refusing O
to O
answer O
the O
inquiry O
, O
she O
moved O
forward O
to O
examine O
it O
, O
talking O
while O
she O
looked O
for O
certain O
old O
- O
fashioned O
ornaments O
on O
the O
stock O

" O
It O
looks O

sure O
enough O

I O
could O
speak O

it O

these O
marks O

You O
see O
it O
were O
his O
grandfather's O
, O
as O
were O
gamekeeper O
to O
some O
one S-CARDINAL
up O
in O
th' O
north O

and O
they O
don't O
make O
guns O
so O
smart O
now O

a O
- O
days O

But O
, O
how O
comed O
you O
by O
it O
? O
He O
sets O
great O
store O
on O
it O

Is O
he O
bound O
for O
th' O
shooting O
gallery O

He O
is O
not O

for O
sure O

now O
his O
aunt O
is O
so O
ill O
, O
and O
me O
left O
all O
alone O

" O
and O
the O
immediate O
cause O
for O
her O
anxiety O
being O
thus O
recalled O
to O
her O
mind O
, O
she O
entered O
on O
a O
long O
story O
of O
Alice's O
illness O
, O
interspersed O
with O
recollections O
of O
her O
husband's O
and O
her O
children's O
deaths O
. O
The O
disguised O
policeman O
listened O
for O
a B-TIME
minute E-TIME
or O
two S-CARDINAL
, O
to O
glean O
any O
further O
information O
he O
could O

and O
then O
, O
saying O
he O
was O
in O
a O
hurry O
, O
he O
turned O
to O
go O
away O
. O
She O
followed O
him O
to O
the O
door O
, O
still O
telling O
him O
her O
troubles O
, O
and O
was O
never O
struck O
, O
until O
it O
was O
too O
late O
to O
ask O
the O
reason O
, O
with O
the O
unaccountableness O
of O
his O
conduct O
, O
in O
carrying O
the O
gun O
away O
with O
him O
. O
Then O
, O
as O
she O
heavily O
climbed O
the O
stairs O
, O
she O
put O
away O
the O
wonder O
and O
the O
thought O
about O
his O
conduct O
, O
by O
determining O
to O
believe O
he O
was O
some O
workman O
with O
whom O
her O
son O
had O
made O
some O
arrangement O
about O
shooting O
at O
the O
gallery O

or O
mending O
the O
old O
weapon O

or O
something O
or O
other O
. O
She O
had O
enough O
to O
fret O
her O
, O
without O
moidering O
herself O
about O
old O
guns O
. O
Jem S-PERSON
had O
given O
it O
him O
to O
bring O
to O
her O
| | O
so O
it O
was O
safe O
enough O

or O
, O
if O
it O
was O
not O
, O
why O
she O
should O
be O
glad O
never O
to O
set O
eyes O
on O
it O
again O
, O
for O
she O
could O
not O
abide O
fire O
- O
arms O
, O
they O
were O
so O
apt O
to O
shoot O
people O
. O
So O
, O
comforting O
herself O
for O
her O
want O
of O
thought O
in O
not O
making O
further O
inquiry O
, O
she O
fell O
off O
into O
another O
doze O
, O
feverish O
, O
dream O
- O
haunted O
, O
and O
unrefreshing O
. O
Meanwhile O
, O
the O
policeman O
walked O
off O
with O
his O
prize O
, O
with O
an O
odd O
mixture O
of O
feelings O

a O
little O
contempt O
, O
a O
little O
disappointment O
, O
and O
a O
good O
deal O
of O
pity O
. O
The O
contempt O
and O
the O
disappointment O
were O
caused O
by O
the O
widow's O
easy O
admission O
of O
the O
gun O
being O
her O
son's O
property O
, O
and O
her O
manner O
of O
identifying O
it O
by O
the O
ornaments O
. O
He O
liked O
an O
attempt O
to O
baffle O
him O
| | O
he O
was O
accustomed O
to O
it O

it O
gave O
some O
exercise O
to O
his O
wits O

his O
shrewdness O
. O
There O
would O
be O
no O
fun O

hunting O

Reynard S-PERSON

himself O
up O

were O
in O
trouble O
, O
changed O
, O
unconscious O
, O
and O
absent O
though O
her O
spirit O
might O
be O
. O
Then O
, O
again O
, O
she O
reproached O
herself O
a O
little O
for O
the O
feeling O
of O
pleasure O
she O
experienced O
, O
in O
thinking O
that O
he O
whom O
she O
dreaded O
could O
never O
more O
beset O
her O
path O
| | O
in O
the O
security O
with O
which O
she O
could O
pass O
each O
street O
corner O
— O
each O
shop O
, O
where O
he O
used O
to O
lie O
in O
ambush O
. O
Oh O
! O
beating O
heart O
! O
was O
there O
no O
other O
little O
thought O
of O
joy O
lurking O
within O
, O
to O
gladden O
the O
very O
air O
without O
? O
Was O
she O
not O
going O
to O
meet O
, O
to O
see O
, O
to O
hear O
Jem S-PERSON
| | O
and O
could O
they O
fail O
at O
last O
to O
understand O
each O
other's O
loving O
hearts O
! O
She O
softly O
lifted O
the O
latch O
, O
with O
the O
privilege O
of O
friendship O
. O
He O
was O
not O
there O
, O
but O
his O
mother O
was O
standing O
by O
the O
fire O
, O
stirring O
some O
little O
mess O
or O
other O
. O
Never O
mind O
! O
he O
would O
come O
soon O
: O
and O
with O
an O
unmixed O
desire O
to O
do O
her O
grateful O
duty O
to O
all O
belonging O
to O
him O
, O
she O
stepped O
lightly O
forwards O
, O
unheard O
by O
the O
old O
lady O
, O
who O
was O
partly O
occupied O
by O
the O
simmering O
, O
bubbling O
sound O
of O
her O
bit O
of O
cookery O
| | O
but O
more O
with O
her O
own O
sad O
thoughts O
, O
and O
wailing O
, O
half S-CARDINAL
- O
uttered O
murmurings O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
took O
off O
bonnet O
and O
shawl O
with O
speed O
, O
and O
advancing O
, O
made O
Mrs. O
Wilson S-PERSON
conscious O
of O
her O
presence O
, O
by O
saying O
, O
" O
Let O
me O
do O
that O
for O
you O
. O
I'm O
sure O
you O
mun O
be O
tired O
. O
" O
Mrs. O
Wilson S-PERSON
slowly O
turned O
round O
, O
and O
her O
eyes O
gleamed O
like O
those O
of O
a O
pent O
- O
up O
wild O
beast O
, O
as O
she O
recognised O
her O
visitor O
. O
" O
And O
is O
it O
thee O
that O
dares O
set O
foot O
in O
this O
house O
, O
after O
what O
has O
come O
to O
pass O
? O
Is O
it O
not O
enough O
to O
have O
robbed O
me O
of O
my O
boy O
with O
thy O
arts O
and O
thy O
profligacy O
, O
but O
thou O
must O
come O
here O
to O
crow O
over O
me O
— O
me O
— O
his O
mother O
? O
Dost O
thou O
know O
where O
he O
is O

thou O
bad O
hussy O
, O
with O
thy O
great O
blue O
eyes O

yellow O
hair O

thy O
angel's O
face O

whited O

thou O
know O
where O
Jem S-PERSON
is O
, O
all O
through O
thee O
? O
" O
" O
No O
! O
" O
quivered O
out O
poor O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
scarcely O
conscious O
that O
she O
spoke O
, O
so O
daunted O
, O
so O
terrified O
was O
she O
by O
the O
indignant O
mother's O
greeting O
. O
" O
He's O
lying O
in O
th' O
New B-GPE
Bailey E-GPE
, O
" O
slowly O
and O
distinctly O
spoke O
the O
mother O
, O
watching O
the O
effect O
of O
her O
words O
, O
as O
if O
believing O
in O
their O
infinite O
power O
to O
pain O
. O
" O
There O
he O
lies O
, O
waiting O
to O
take O
his O
trial O
for O
murdering O
young O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
. O
" O
There O
was O
no O
answer O

but O
such O
a O
blanched O
face O
, O
such O
wild O
, O
distended O
eyes O
, O
such O
trembling O
limbs O
, O
instinctively O
seeking O
support O
! O
" O
Did O
you O
know O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
as O
now O
lies O
dead O

" O
continued O
the O
merciless O
woman O
. O
" O
Folk O
say O
you O
did O
, O
and O
knew O
him O
but O
too O
well O
. O
And O
that O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
such O
as O
you O
, O
my O
precious O
child O
shot O
yon O
chap O

But O
he O
did O
not O

I O
know O
he O
did O
not O
. O
They O
may O
hang O
him O
, O
but O
his O
mother O
will O
speak O
to O
his O
innocence O
with O
her O
last O
dying O
breath O
. O
" O
She O
stopped O
more O
from O
exhaustion O
than O
want O
of O
words O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
spoke O
, O
but O
in O
so O
changed O
and O
choked O
a O
voice O
that O
the O
old O
woman O
almost O
started O
. O
It O
seemed O
as O
if O
some O
third S-ORDINAL
person O
must O
be O
in O
the O
room O
, O
the O
voice O
was O
so O
hoarse O
and O
strange O
. O
" O
Please O
, O
say O
it O
again O
. O
I O
don't O
quite O
understand O
you O
. O
What O
has O
Jem S-PERSON
done O
? O
Please O
to O
tell O
me O
. O
" O
" O
I O
never O
said O
he O
had O
done O
it O
. O
I O
said O
, O
and O
I'll S-PERSON
swear O
that O
he O
never O
did O
do O
it O
. O
I O
don't O
care O
who O
heard O
' O
em O
quarrel O
, O
or O
if O
it O
is O
his O
gun O
as O
were O
found O
near O
the O
body O
. O
It's O
not O
my O
own O
Jem S-PERSON
as O
would O
go O
for O
to O
kill O
any O
man O
, O
choose O
how O
a O
girl O
had O
jilted O
him O
. O
My O
own O
good O
Jem S-PERSON
, O
as O
was O
a O
blessing O
sent O
upon O
the O
house O
where O
he O
was O
born O
. O
" O
Tears O
came O
into O
the O
mother's O
burning O
eyes O
as O
her O
heart O
recurred O
to O
the O
days O
when O
she O
had O
rocked O
the O
cradle O
of O
her O
" O
first S-ORDINAL
- O
born O

" O
and O
then O
, O
rapidly O
passing O
over O
events O
, O
till O
the O
full O
consciousness O
of O
his O
present O
situation O
came O
upon O
her O
, O
and O
perhaps O
annoyed O
at O
having O
shown O
any O
softness O
of O
character O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
Dalilah S-PERSON
who O
had O
lured O
him O
to O
his O
danger O
, O
she O
spoke O
again O
, O
and O
in O
a O
sharper O
tone O
. O
" O
I O
told O
him O
, O
and O
told O
him O
to O
leave O
off O
thinking O
on O
thee O

he O
wouldn't O
be O
led O
by O
me O

Thee O
! O
wench O
! O
thou O
were O
not O
good O
enough O
to O
wipe O
the O
dust O
off O
his O
feet O

A O
vile O
, O
flirting O
quean O
as O
thou O
art O
. O
It's O
well O
thy O
mother O
does O
not O
know O
( O
poor O
body O
) O
what O
a O
good O
- O
for O
- O
nothing O
thou O
art O

" O
" O
Mother O
! O
oh O
mother O
! O
" O
said O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
as O
if O
appealing O
to O
the O
merciful O
dead O

" O

I O
was O
not O
good O
enough O
for O
him O
! O
I O
know O
I O
was O
not O
, O
" O
added O
she O
, O
in O
a O
voice O
of O
touching O
humility O
. O
For O
through O
her O
heart O
went O
tolling O
the O
ominous O
, O
prophetic O
words O
he O
had O
used O
when O
he O
had O
last O
spoken O
to O
her O
— O
" O
Mary S-PERSON
! O
you'll O
may O
be O
hear O
of O
me O
as O
a O
drunkard O
, O
and O
may O
be O
as O
a O
thief O
, O
and O
may O
be O
as O
a O
murderer O
. O
Remember O
! O
when O
all O
are O
speaking O
ill O
of O
me O
, O
yo O
will O
have O
no O
right O
to O
blame O
me O

for O
it's O
your O
cruelty O
that O
will O
have O
made O
me O
what O
I O
feel O
I O
shall O
become O

" O
And O
she O
did O
not O
blame O
him O
, O
though O
she O
doubted O
not O
his O
guilt O

she O
felt O
how O
madly O
she O
might O
act O

once O
jealous O

him O

how O
much O
cause O
had O
she O
not O

him O
for O
jealousy O

miserable O
guilty O
wretch O

on O

desolate O
mother O
! O
Abuse O
her O
as O
you O
will O

Her O
broken O
spirit O

have O
merited O
all O

But O
her O
last O
humble O
, O
self O
- O
abased O
words O
had O
touched O
Mrs. O
Wilson's S-PERSON
heart O
, O
sore O
as O
it O
was O

and O
she O
looked O
at O
the O
snow O
- O
pale O
girl O
with O
those O
piteous O
eyes O
, O
so O
hopeless O
of O
comfort O
, O
and O
she O
relented O
in O
spite O
of O
herself O
. O
" O
Thou O
seest O
what O
comes O
of O
light O
conduct O
, O
Mary S-PERSON

It's O
thy O
doing O
that O
suspicion O
has O
lighted O
on O
him O

who O
is O
as O
innocent O

the O
babe O

have O
my O
death O
too O
at O
thy O
door O
! O
" O
Harsh O
as O
these O
words O
seem O
, O
she O
spoke O
them O
in O
a O
milder O
tone O
of O
voice O
than O
she O
had O
yet O
used O

But O
the O
idea O
of O
Jem S-PERSON
on O
the O
gallows O
, O
Jem S-PERSON
dead O
, O
took O
possession O
of O
Mary S-PERSON
, O

she O
covered O
her O
eyes O
with O
her O
wan O
hands O
, O
as O
if O
indeed O
to O
shut O
out O
the O
fearful O
sight O

She O
murmured O
some O
words O

which O
, O

spoken O
low O

choked O
up O

, O

oh O

" O
with O
a O
sudden O
revulsion O
of O

the O
reality O
of O
the O
danger O

down O

She O
sobbed O
aloud O
with O
bitter O
consciousness O
of O
the O
fearful O
chance O
awaiting O
her O
child O

She O
cried O
more O
passionately O
still O

Mary S-PERSON
roused O
herself O
up O

" O

The O
more O
obstinately O

upbraidingly O
Mrs. O
Wilson S-PERSON
refused O

the O
more O
Mary S-PERSON
pleaded O

entreating O

Her O
stunned O
soul O
seemed O
to O
bound O
its O
wishes O

for O
the O
hour O
at O
least O

to O
remaining O
with O
one O

Good O

" O
And O
Mary S-PERSON
turned O
out O
of O
the O
house O
, O
which O
had O
been O
his O
home O
, O
where O
he O
was O
loved O
, O
and O
mourned O
for O
, O
into O
the O
busy O
, O
desolate O
, O
crowded O
street O
, O
where O
they O
were O
crying O
halfpenny O
broadsides O
, O
giving O
an O
account O
of O
the O
bloody O
murder O
, O
the O
coroner's O
inquest O
, O
and O
a O
raw O
- O
head O
- O
and O
- O
bloody O
- O
bones O
picture O
of O
the O
suspected O
murderer O
, O
James B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
. O
But O
Mary S-PERSON
heard O
not O
, O
she O
heeded O
not O
. O
She O
staggered O
on O
like O
one O
in O
a O
dream O
. O
With O
hung O
head O
and O
tottering O
steps O
, O
she O
instinctively O
chose O
the O
shortest O
cut O
to O
that O
home O
, O
which O
was O
to O
her O
, O
in O
her O
present O
state O
of O
mind O
, O
only O
the O
hiding O
place O
of O
four S-CARDINAL
walls O
, O
where O
she O
might O
vent O
her O
agony O
, O
unseen O
and O
unnoticed O
by O
the O
keen O
, O
unkind O
world O
without O
, O
but O
where O
no O
welcome O
, O
no O
love O
, O
no O
sympathising O
tears O
awaited O
her O
. O
As O
she O
neared O
that O
home O
, O
within O
two S-CARDINAL
minutes' O
walk O
of O
it O
, O
her O
impetuous O
course O
was O
arrested O
by O
a O
light O
touch O
on O
her O
arm O
, O
and O
turning O
hastily O
, O
she O
saw O
a O
little O
Italian S-NORP
boy O
with O
his O
humble O
show O
- O
box O
, O
— O
a O
white O
mouse O
, O
or O
some O
such O
thing O
. O
The O
setting O
sun O
cast O
its O
red O
glow O
on O
his O
face O
, O
otherwise O
the O
olive O
complexion O
would O
have O
been O
very O
pale O
| | O
and O
the O
glittering O
tear O
- O
drops O
hung O
on O
the O
long O
curled O
eye O
- O
lashes O
. O
With O
his O
soft O
voice O
and O
pleading O
looks O
, O
he O
uttered O
, O
in O
his O
pretty O
broken O
English S-LANGUAGE
, O
the O
words O
" O
Hungry O
! O
so O
hungry O
. O
" O
And O
, O
as O
if O
to O
aid O
by O
gesture O
the O
effect O
of O
the O
solitary O
word O
, O
he O
pointed O
to O
his O
mouth O
, O
with O
its O
white O
quivering O
lips O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
answered O
him O
impatiently O
, O
" O
Oh O
, O
lad O
, O
hunger O
is O
nothing O
— O
nothing O
! O
" O
And O
she O
rapidly O
passed O
on O
. O
But O
her O
heart O
upbraided O
her O
the O
next O
minute O
with O
her O
unrelenting O
speech O
, O
and O
she O
hastily O
entered O
her O
door O
and O
seized O
the O
scanty O
remnant O
of O
food O
which O
the O
cupboard O
contained O
, O
and O
retraced O
her O
steps O
to O
the O
place O
where O
the O
little O
hopeless O
stranger O
had O
sunk O
down O
by O
his O
mute O
companion O
in O
loneliness O
and O
starvation O
, O
and O
was O
raining O
down O
tears O
as O
he O
spoke O
in O
some O
foreign O
tongue O
, O
with O
low O
cries O
for O
the O
far O
distant O
" O
Mamma O
mia O
! O
" O
With O
the O
elasticity O
of O
heart O
belonging O
to O
childhood O
he O
sprang O
up O
as O
he O
saw O
the O
food O
the O
girl O
brought O
| | O
she O
whose O
face O
, O
lovely O
in O
its O
woe O
, O
had O
tempted O
him O
first S-ORDINAL
to O
address O
her O
| | O
and O
, O
with O
the O
graceful O
courtesy O
of O
his O
country O
, O
he O
looked O
up O
and O
smiled O
while O
he O
kissed O
her O
hand O
, O
and O
then O
poured O
forth O
his O
thanks O
, O
and O
shared O
her O
bounty O
with O
his O
little O
pet O
companion O
. O
She O
stood O
an O
instant O
, O
diverted O
from O
the O
thought O
of O
her O
own O
grief O
by O
the O
sight O
of O
his O
infantine O
gladness O
| | O
and O
then O
bending O
down O
and O
kissing O
his O
smooth O
forehead O
, O
she O
left O
him O
, O
and O
sought O
to O
be O
alone O
with O
her O
agony O
once O
more O
. O
She O
re-entered O
the O
house O
, O
locked O
the O
door O
, O
and O
tore O
off O
her O
bonnet O
, O
as O
if O
greedy O
of O
every O
moment O
which O
took O
her O
from O
the O
full O
indulgence O
of O
painful O
, O
despairing O
thought O
. O
Then O
she O
threw O
herself O
on O
the O
ground O
, O
yes O
, O
on O
the O
hard O
flags O
she O
threw O
her O
soft O
limbs O
down O
| | O
and O
the O
comb O
fell O
out O
of O
her O
hair O
, O
and O
those O
bright O
tresses O
swept O
the O
dusty O
floor O
, O
while O
she O
pillowed O
and O
hid O
her O
face O
on O
her O
arms O
, O
and O
burst O
forth O
into O
hard O
, O
suffocating O
sobs O
. O
Oh O
, O
earth O
! O
thou O
didst O
seem O
but O
a O
dreary O
dwelling O
- O
place O
for O
thy O
poor O
child O
that O
night O
. O
None O
to O
comfort O
, O
none O
to O
pity O
! O
And O
self O
- O
reproach O
gnawing O
at O
her O
heart O
. O
Oh O
, O
why O
did O
she O
ever O
listen O
to O
the O
tempter O
? O
Why O
did O
she O
ever O
give O
ear O
to O
her O
own O
suggestions O
, O
and O
cravings O
after O
wealth O
and O
grandeur O
? O
Why O
had O
she O
thought O
it O
a O
fine O
thing O
to O
have O
a O
rich O
lover O
? O
She O
— O
she O
had O
deserved O
it O
all O
| | O
but O
he O
was O
the O
victim O
, O
— O
he O
, O
the O
beloved O
. O
She O
could O
not O
conjecture O
, O
she O
could O
not O
even O
pause O
to O
think O
who O
had O
revealed O
, O
or O
how O
he O
had O
discovered O
her O
acquaintance O
with O
Harry B-PERSON
Carson E-PERSON
. O
It O
was O
but O
too O
clear O
, O
some O
way O
or O
another O
, O
he O
had O
learnt O
all O
| | O
and O
what O
would O
he O
think O
of O
her O
? O
No O
hope O
of O
his O
love O
, O
— O
oh O
, O
that O
she O
would O
give O
up O
, O
and O
be O
content O
| | O
it O
was O
his O
life O
, O
his O
precious O
life O
, O
that O
was O
threatened O
. O
Then O
she O
tried O
to O
recall O
the O
particulars O
, O
which O
, O
when O
Mrs. O
Wilson S-PERSON
had O
given O
them O
, O
had O
fallen O
but O
upon O
a O
deafened O
ear O
, O
— O
something O
about O
a O
gun O
, O
a O
quarrel O
, O
which O
she O
could O
not O
remember O
clearly O
. O
Oh O
, O
how O
terrible O
to O
think O
of O
his O
crime O
, O
his O
blood O
- O
guiltiness O
| | O
he O
who O
had O
hitherto O
been O
so O
good O
, O
so O
noble O
, O
and O
now O
an O
assassin O
! O
And O
then O
she O
shrank O
from O
him O
in O
thought O
| | O
and O
then O
, O
with O
bitter O
remorse O
, O
clung O
more O
closely O
to O
his O
image O
with O
passionate O
self O
- O
upbraiding O
. O
Was O
it O
not O
she O
who O
had O
led O
him O
to O
the O
pit O
into O
which O
he O
had O
fallen O
? O
Was O
she O
to O
blame O
him O
? O
She O
to O
judge O
him O
? O
Who O
could O
tell O
how O
maddened O
he O
might O
have O
been O
by O
jealousy O
| | O
how O
one S-CARDINAL
moment's O
uncontrollable O
passion O
might O
have O
led O
him O
to O
become O
a O
murderer O
? O
And O
she O
had O
blamed O
him O
in O
her O
heart O
after O
his O
last O
deprecating O
, O
imploring O
, O
prophetic O
speech O
! O
Then O
she O
burst O
out O
crying O
afresh O
| | O
and O
when O
weary O
of O
crying O
, O
fell O
to O
thinking O
again O
. O
The O
gallows O
! O
The O
gallows O
! O
Black O
it O
stood O
against O
the O
burning O
light O
which O
dazzled O
her O
shut O
eyes O
, O
press O
on O
them O
as O
she O
would O
. O
Oh O
! O
she O
was O
going O
mad O
| | O
and O
for O
awhile O
she O
lay O
outwardly O
still O
, O
but O
with O
the O
pulses O
careering O
through O
her O
head O
with O
wild O
vehemence O
. O
And O
then O
came O
a O
strange O
forgetfulness O
of O
the O
present O
, O
in O
thought O
of O
the O
long O
- O
past O
times O
| | O
— O
of O
those O
days O
when O
she O
hid O
her O
face O
on O
her O
mother's O
pitying O
, O
loving O
bosom O
, O
and O
heard O
tender O
words O
of O
comfort O
, O
be O
her O
grief O
or O
her O
error O
what O
it O
might O
| | O
— O
of O
those O
days O
when O
she O
had O
felt O
as O
if O
her O
mother's O
love O
was O
too O
mighty O
not O
to O
last O
for O
ever O
| | O
— O
of O
those O
days O
when O
hunger O
had O
been O
to O
her O
( O
as O
to O
the O
little O
stranger O
she O
had O
that O
evening O
relieved O
) O
something O
to O
be O
thought O
about O
, O
and O
mourned O
over O
| | O
— O
when O
Jem S-PERSON
and O
she O
had O
played O
together O
| | O
he O
, O
with O
the O
condescension O
of O
an O
older O
child O
, O
and O
she O
, O
with O
unconscious O
earnestness O
, O
believing O
that O
he O
was O
as O
much O
gratified O
with O
important O
trifles O
as O
she O
was O
| | O
— O
when O
her O
father O
was O
a O
cheery O
- O
hearted O
man O
, O
rich O
in O
the O
love O
of O
his O
wife O
, O
and O
the O
companionship O
of O
his O
friend O
| | O
— O
when O
( O
for O
it O
still O
worked O
round O
to O
that O
) O
, O
when O
mother O
was O
alive O
, O
and O
he O
was O
not O
a O
murderer O
. O
And O
then O
Heaven O
blessed O
her O
unaware O
, O
and O
she O
sank O
from O
remembering O
, O
to O
wandering O
, O
unconnected O
thought O
, O
and O
thence O
to O
sleep O
. O
Yes O
! O
it O
was O
sleep O
, O
though O
in O
that O
strange O
posture O
, O
on O
that O
hard O
cold O
bed O
| | O
and O
she O
dreamt O
of O
the O
happy O
times O
of O
long O
ago O
, O
and O
her O
mother O
came O
to O
her O
, O
and O
kissed O
her O
as O
she O
lay O
, O
and O
once O
more O
the O
dead O
were O
alive O
again O
in O
that O
happy O
world O
of O
dreams O
. O
All O
was O
restored O
to O
the O
gladness O
of O
childhood O
, O
even O
to O
the O
little O
kitten O
which O
had O
been O
her O
playmate O
and O
bosom O
friend O
then O
, O
and O
which O
had O
been O
long O
forgotten O
in O
her O
waking O
hours O
. O
All O
the O
loved O
ones O
were O
there O
! O
She O
suddenly O
wakened O
! O
Clear O
and O
wide O
awake O
! O
Some O
noise O
had O
startled O
her O
from O
sleep O
. O
She O
sat O
up O
, O
and O
put O
her O
hair O
( O
still O
wet O
with O
tears O
) O
back O
from O
her O
flushed O
cheeks O
, O
and O
listened O
. O
At O
first O
she O
could O
only O
hear O
her O
beating O
heart O
. O
All O
was O
still O
without O
, O
for O
it O
was O
after O
midnight O
, O
such O
hours O
of O
agony O
had O
passed O
away O
| | O
but O
the O
moon O
shone O
clearly O
in O
at O
the O
unshuttered O
window O
, O
making O
the O
room O
almost O
as O
light O
as O
day O
, O
in O
its O
cold O
ghastly O
radiance O
. O
There O
was O
a O
low O
knock O
at O
the O
door O
! O
A O
strange O
feeling O
crept O
over O
Mary's S-PERSON
heart O
, O
as O
if O
something O
spiritual O
were O
near O
| | O
as O
if O
the O
dead O
, O
so O
lately O
present O
in O
her O
dreams O
, O
were O
yet O
gliding O
and O
hovering O
round O
her O
, O
with O
their O
dim O
, O
dread O
forms O
. O
And O
yet O
, O
why O
dread O
? O
Had O
they O
not O
loved O
her O
? O
— O
and O
who O
loved O
her O
now O
? O
Was O
she O
not O
lonely O
enough O
to O
welcome O
the O
spirits O
of O
the O
dead O
, O
who O
had O
loved O
her O
while O
here O
? O
If O
her O
mother O
had O
conscious O
being O
, O
her O
love O
for O
her O
child O
endured O
. O
So O
she O
quieted O
her O
fears O
, O
and O
listened O
— O
listened O
still O
. O
" O
Mary S-PERSON
! O
Mary S-PERSON
! O
open O
the O
door O
! O
" O
as O
a O
little O
movement O
on O
her O
part O
seemed O
to O
tell O
the O
being O
outside O
of O
her O
wakeful O
, O
watchful O
state O
. O
They O

accents O
of O

mother's O
voice O

very O
south O

country O
pronunciation O

that O
Mary S-PERSON
so O
well O
remembered O

and O
which O
she O
had O
sometimes O
tried O
to O
imitate O
when O
alone O
, O
with O
the O
fond O
mimicry O
of O
affection O
. O
So O
, O
without O
fear O
, O
without O
hesitation O
, O
she O
rose O
and O
unbarred O
the O
door O
. O
There O
, O
against O
the O
moonlight O
, O
stood O
a O
form O
, O
so O
closely O
resembling O
her O
dead O
mother O
, O
that O
Mary S-PERSON
never O
doubted O
the O
identity O
, O
but O
exclaiming O
( O
as O
if O
she O
were O
a O
terrified O
child O
, O
secure O
of O
safety O

near O
the O
protecting O
care O
of O
its O
parent O
) O
— O
" O
Oh O
! O
mother O
! O
mother O
! O
You O
are O
come O
at O
last O
! O
" O
She O
threw O
herself O
, O
or O
rather O
fell O
, O
into O
the O
trembling O
arms O
of O
her O
long O

" O
I O
must O
go O
back O
a O
little O
to O
explain O
the O
motives O
which O
caused O
Esther S-PERSON
to O
seek O
an O
interview O
with O
her O
niece O
. O
The O
murder O
had O
been O
committed O
early B-TIME
on I-TIME
Thursday I-TIME
night E-TIME
, O
and O
between B-TIME
then I-TIME
and I-TIME
the I-TIME
dawn I-TIME
of I-TIME
the I-TIME
following I-TIME
day E-TIME
there O
was O
ample O
time O
for O
the O
news O
to O
spread O
far O
and O
wide O
among O
all O
those O
whose O
duty O
, O
or O
whose O
want O
, O
or O
whose O
errors O
, O
caused O
them O
to O
be O
abroad O
in O
the O
streets O
of O
Manchester S-GPE
. O
Among O
those O
who O
listened O
to O
the O
tale O
of O
violence O
was O
Esther S-PERSON
. O
A O
craving O
desire O
to O
know O
more O
took O
possession O
of O
her O
mind O
. O
Far O
away O
as O
she O
was O
from O
Turner B-FAC
Street E-FAC
, O
she O
immediately O
set O
off O
to O
the O
scene O
of O
the O
murder O
, O
which O
was O
faintly O
lighted O
by O
the O
gray O
dawn O
as O
she O
reached O
the O
spot O
. O
It O
was O
so O
quiet O
and O
still O
that O
she O
could O
hardly O
believe O
it O
to O
be O
the O
place O
. O
The O
only O
vestige O
of O
any O
scuffle O
or O
violence O
was O
a O
trail O
on O
the O
dust O
, O
as O
if O
somebody O
had O
been O
lying O
there O
, O
and O
then O
been O
raised O
by O
extraneous O
force O
. O
The O
little O
birds O
were O
beginning O
to O
hop O
and O
twitter O
in O
the O
leafless O
hedge O
, O
making O
the O
only O
sound O
that O
was O
near O
and O
distinct O
. O
She O
crossed O
into O
the O
field O
where O
she O
guessed O
the O
murderer O
to O
have O
stood O
| | O
it O
was O
easy O
of O
access O
, O
for O
the O
worn O
, O
stunted O
hawthorn O
- O
hedge O
had O
many O
gaps O
in O
it O
. O
The O
night O
- O
smell O
of O
bruised O
grass O
came O
up O
from O
under O
her O
feet O
, O
as O
she O
went O
towards O
the O
saw O
- O
pit O
and O
carpenter's O
shed O
, O
which O
, O
as O
I O
have O
said O
before O
, O
were O
in O
a O
corner O
of O
the O
field O
near O
the O
road O
, O
and O
where O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
her O
informants O
had O
told O
her O
it O
was O
supposed O
by O
the O
police O
that O
the O
murderer O
had O
lurked O
while O
waiting O
for O
his O
victim O
. O
There O
was O
no O
sign O
, O
however O
, O
that O
any O
one O
had O
been O
about O
the O
place O
. O
If O
the O
grass O
had O
been O
bruised O
or O
bent O
where O
he O
had O
trod O
, O
it O
had O
had O
enough O
of O
the O
elasticity O
of O
life O
to O
raise O
itself O
under O
the O
dewy O
influences O
of O
night O
. O
She O
hushed O
her O
breath O
with O
involuntary O
awe O
, O
but O
nothing O
else O
told O
of O
the O
violent O
deed O
by O
which O
a O
fellow O
- O
creature O
had O
passed O
away O
. O
She O
stood O
still O
for O
a B-TIME
minute E-TIME
, O
imagining O
to O
herself O
the O
position O
of O
the O
parties O
, O
guided O
by O
the O
only O
circumstance O
which O
afforded O
any O
evidence O
, O
the O
trailing O
mark O
on O
the O
dust O
in O
the O
road O
. O
Suddenly O
( O
it O
was O
before O
the O
sun O
had O
risen O
above O
the O
horizon O
) O
she O
became O
aware O
of O
something O
white O
in O
the O
hedge O
. O
All O
other O
colours O
wore O
the O
same O
murky O
hue O
, O
though O
the O
forms O
of O
objects O
were O
perfectly O
distinct O
. O
What O
was O
it O
? O
It O
could O
not O
be O
a O
flower O
| | O
— O
that O
, O
the O
time O
of O
year O
made O
clear O
. O
A O
frozen O
lump O
of O
snow O
, O
lingering O
late O
in O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
gnarled O
tufts O
of O
the O
hedge O
? O
She O
stepped O
forward O
to O
examine O
. O
It O
proved O
to O
be O
a O
little O
piece O
of O
stiff O
writing O
- O
paper O
compressed O
into O
a O
round O
shape O
. O
She O
understood O
it O
instantly O
| | O
it O
was O
the O
paper O
that O
had O
served O
as O
wadding O
for O
the O
murderer's O
gun O
. O
Then O
she O
had O
been O
standing O
just O
where O
the O
murderer O
must O
have O
been O
but O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
hours E-TIME
before O
| | O
probably O
( O
as O
the O
rumour O
had O
spread O
through O
the O
town O
, O
reaching O
her O
ears O
) O
one O
of O
the O
poor O
maddened O
turn O
- O
outs O
, O
who O
hung O
about O
everywhere O
, O
with O
black O
, O
fierce O
looks O
, O
as O
if O
contemplating O
some O
deed O
of O
violence O
. O
Her O
sympathy O
was O
all O
with O
them O
, O
for O
she O
had O
known O
what O
they O
suffered O
| | O
and O
besides O
this O
there O
was O
her O
own O
individual O
dislike O
of O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
, O
and O
dread O
of O
him O
for O
Mary's S-PERSON
sake O
. O
Yet O
, O
poor O
Mary S-PERSON
! O
Death O
was O
a O
terrible O
, O
though O
sure O
, O
remedy O
for O
the O
evil O
Esther S-PERSON
had O
dreaded O
for O
her O
| | O
and O
how O
would O
she O
stand O
the O
shock O
, O
loving O
as O
her O
aunt O
believed O
her O
to O
do O
? O
Poor O
Mary S-PERSON
! O
who O
would O
comfort O
her O
? O
Esther's S-PERSON
thoughts O
began O
to O
picture O
her O
sorrow O
, O
her O
despair O
, O
when O
the O
news O
of O
her O
lover's O
death O
should O
reach O
her O
| | O
and O
she O
longed O
to O
tell O
her O
there O
might O
have O
been O
a O
keener O
grief O
yet O
had O
he O
lived O
. O
Bright O
, O
beautiful O
came O
the O
slanting O
rays O
of O
the O
morning O
sun O
. O
It O
was O
time O
for O
such O
as O
she O
to O
hide O
themselves O
, O
with O
the O
other O
obscene O
things O
of O
night O
, O
from O
the O
glorious O
light O
of O
day O
, O
which O
was O
only O
for O
the O
happy O
. O
So O
she O
turned O
her O
steps O
towards O
town O
, O
still O
holding O
the O
paper O
. O
But O
in O
getting O
over O
the O
hedge O
it O
encumbered O
her O
to O
hold O
it O
in O
her O
clasped O
hand O
, O
and O
she O
threw O
it O
down O
. O
She O
passed O
on O
a O
few O
steps O
, O
her O
thoughts O
still O
of O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
till O
the O
idea O
crossed O
her O
mind O
, O
could O
it O
( O
blank O
as O
it O
appeared O
to O
be O
) O
give O
any O
clue O
to O
the O
murderer O
? O
As O
I O
said O
before O
, O
her O
sympathies O
were O
all O
on O
that O
side O
, O
so O
she O
turned O
back O
and O
picked O
it O
up O
| | O
and O
then O
feeling O
as O
if O
in O
some O
measure O
an O
accessory O
, O
she O
hid O
it O
unexamined O
in O
her O
hand O
, O
and O
hastily O
passed O
out O
of O
the O
street O
at O
the O
opposite O
end O
to O
that O
by O
which O
she O
had O
entered O
it O
. O
And O
what O
do O
you O
think O
she O
felt O
, O
when O
, O
having O
walked O
some O
distance O
from O
the O
spot O
, O
she O
dared O
to O
open O
the O
crushed O
paper O
, O
and O
saw O
written O
on O
it O
Mary B-PERSON
Barton's E-PERSON
name O
, O
and O
not O
only O
that O
, O
but O
the O
street O
in O
which O
she O
lived O
! O
True O
, O
a O
letter O
or O
two S-CARDINAL
was O
torn O
off O
, O
but O
, O
nevertheless O
, O
there O
was O
the O
name O
clear O
to O
be O
recognised O
. O
And O
oh O
! O
what O
terrible O
thought O
flashed O
into O
her O
mind O
| | O
or O
was O
it O
only O
fancy O
? O
But O
it O
looked O
very O
like O
the O
writing O
which O
she O
had O
once O
known O
well O
— O
the O
writing O
of O
Jem B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
, O
who O
, O
when O
she O
lived O
at O
her O
brother O
- O
in O
- O
law's O
, O
and O
he O
was O
a O
near O
neighbour O
, O
had O
often O
been O
employed O
by O
her O
to O
write O
her O
letters O
to O
people O
, O
to O
whom O
she O
was O
ashamed O
of O
sending O
her O
own O
misspelt O
scrawl O
. O
She O
remembered O
the O
wonderful O
flourishes O
she O
had O
so O
much O
admired O
in O
those O
days O
, O
while O
she O
sat O
by O
dictating O
, O
and O
Jem S-PERSON
, O
in O
all O
the O
pride O
of O
newly O
- O
acquired O
penmanship O
, O
used O
to O
dazzle O
her O
eyes O
by O
extraordinary O
graces O
and O
twirls O
. O
If O
it O
were O
his O
! O
Oh O
! O
perhaps O
it O
was O
merely O
that O
her O
head O
was O
running O
so O
on O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
that O
she O
was O
associating O
every O
trifle O
with O
her O
. O
As O
if O
only O
one S-CARDINAL
person O
wrote O
in O
that O
flourishing O
, O
meandering O
style O
! O
It O
was O
enough O
to O
fill O
her O
mind O
to O
think O
from O
what O
she O
might O
have O
saved O
Mary S-PERSON
by O
securing O
the O
paper O
. O
She O
would O
look O
at O
it O
just O
once O
more O
, O
and O
see O
if O
some O
very O
dense O
and O
stupid O
policeman O
could O
have O
mistaken O
the O
name O
, O
or O
if O
Mary S-PERSON
would O
certainly O
have O
been O
dragged O
into O
notice O
in O
the O
affair O
. O
No O
! O
no O
one O
could O
have O
mistaken O
the O
" O
ry O
Barton S-PERSON
, O
" O
and O
it O
was O
Jem's S-PERSON
handwriting O
! O
Oh O
! O
if O
it O
was O
so O
, O
she O
understood O
it O
all O
, O
and O
she O
had O
been O
the O
cause O
! O
With O
her O
violent O
and O
unregulated O
nature O
, O
rendered O
morbid O
by O
the O
course O
of O
life O
she O
led O
, O
and O
her O
consciousness O
of O
her O
degradation O
, O
she O
cursed O
herself O
for O
the O
interference O
which O
she O
believed O
had O
led O
to O
this O
| | O
for O
the O
information O
and O
the O
warning O
she O
had O
given O
to O
Jem S-PERSON
, O
which O
had O
roused O
him O
to O
this O
murderous O
action O
. O
How O
could O
she O
, O
the O
abandoned O
and O
polluted O
outcast O
, O
ever O
have O
dared O
to O
hope O
for O
a O
blessing O
, O
even O
on O
her O
efforts O
to O
do O
good O
? O
The O
black O
curse O
of O
Heaven O
rested O
on O
all O
her O
doings O
, O
were O
they O
for O
good O
or O
for O
evil O
. O
Poor O
, O
diseased O
mind O
! O
and O
there O
were O
none O
to O
minister O
to O
thee O
! O
So O
she O
wandered O
about O
, O
too O
restless O
to O
take O
her O
usual O
heavy O
morning's O
sleep O
, O
up O
and O
down O
the O
streets O
, O
greedily O
listening O
to O
every O
word O
of O
the O
passers O
by O
, O
and O
loitering O
near O
each O
group O
of O
talkers O
, O
anxious O
to O
scrape O
together O
every O
morsel O
of O
information O
, O
or O
conjecture O
, O
or O
suspicion O
, O
though O
without O
possessing O
any O
definite O
purpose O
in O
all O
this O
. O
And O
ever O
and O
always O
she O
clenched O
the O
scrap O
of O
paper O
which O
might O
betray O
so O
much O
, O
until O
her O
nails O
had O
deeply O
indented O
the O
palm O
of O
her O
hand O
| | O
so O
fearful O
was O
she O
in O
her O
nervous O
dread O
, O
lest O
unawares O
she O
should O
let O
it O
drop O
. O
Towards O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
day O
she O
could O
no O
longer O
evade O
the O
body's O
craving O
want O
of O
rest O
and O
refreshment O
| | O
but O
the O
rest O
was O
taken O
in O
a O
spirit O
vault O
, O
and O
the O
refreshment O
was O
a O
glass O
of O
gin O
. O
Then O
she O
started O
up O
from O
the O
stupor O
she O
had O
taken O
for O
repose O
| | O
and O
suddenly O
driven O
before O
the O
gusty O
impulses O
of O
her O
mind O
, O
she O
pushed O
her O
way O
to O
the O
place O
where O
at O
that O
very O
time O
the O
police O
were O
bringing O
the O
information O
they O
had O
gathered O
with O
regard O
to O
the O
all O
- O
engrossing O
murder O
. O
She O
listened O
with O
painful O
acuteness O
of O
comprehension O
to O
dropped O
words O
and O
unconnected O
sentences O
, O
the O
meaning O
of O
which O
became O
clearer O
, O
and O
yet O
more O
clear O
to O
her O
. O
Jem S-PERSON
was O
suspected O
. O
Jem S-PERSON
was O
ascertained O
to O
be O
the O
murderer O
. O
She O
saw O
him O
( O
although O
he O
, O
absorbed O
in O
deep O
sad O
thought O
, O
saw O
her O
not O
) O
, O
she O
saw O
him O
brought O
hand O
- O
cuffed O
and O
guarded O
out O
of O
the O
coach O
. O
She O
saw O
him O
enter O
the O
station O
, O
— O
she O
gasped O
for O
breath O
till O
he O
came O
out O
, O
still O
hand O
- O
cuffed O
, O
and O
still O
guarded O
, O
to O
be O
conveyed O
to O
the B-ORG
New I-ORG
Bailey E-ORG
. O
He O
was O
the O
only O
one O
who O
had O
spoken O
to O
her O
with O
hope O
, O
that O
she O
might O
yet O
win O
her O
way O
back O
to O
virtue O
. O
His O
words O
had O
lingered O
in O
her O
heart O
with O
a O
sort O
of O
call O
to O
Heaven O
, O
like O
distant O
Sabbath O
bells O
, O
although O
in O
her O
despair O
she O
had O
turned O
away O
from O
his O
voice O
. O
He O
was O
the O
only O
one O
who O
had O
spoken O
to O
her O
kindly O
. O
The O
murder O
, O
shocking O
though O
it O
was O
, O
was O
an O
absent O
, O
abstract O
thing O
, O
on O
which O
her O
thoughts O
could O
not O
, O
and O
would O
not O
dwell O
| | O
all O
that O
was O
present O
in O
her O
mind O
was O
Jem's S-PERSON
danger O
, O
and O
his O
kindness O
. O
Then O
Mary S-PERSON
came O
to O
remembrance O
. O
Esther S-PERSON
wondered O
till O
she O
was O
sick O
of O
wondering O
, O
in O
what O
way O
she O
was O
taking O
the O
affair O
. O
In O
some O
manner O
it O
would O
be O
a O
terrible O
blow O
for O
the O
poor O
, O
motherless O
girl O
| | O
with O
her O
dreadful O
father O
, O
too O
, O
who O
was O
to O
Esther S-PERSON
a O
sort O
of O
accusing O
angel O
. O
She O
set O
off O
towards O
the O
court O
where O
Mary S-PERSON
lived O
, O
to O
pick O
up O
what O
she O
could O
there O
of O
information O
. O
But O
she O
was O
ashamed O
to O
enter O
in O
where O
once O
she O
had O
been O
innocent O
, O
and O
hung O
about O
the O
neighbouring O
streets O
, O
not O
daring O
to O
question O
, O
so O
she O
learnt O
but O
little O
| | O
nothing O
in O
fact O
but O
the O
knowledge O
of O
John B-PERSON
Barton's E-PERSON
absence O
from O
home O
. O
She O
went O
up O
a O
dark O
entry O
to O
rest O
her O
weary O
limbs O
on O
a O
door O
- O
step O
and O
think O
. O
Her O
elbows O
on O
her O
knees O
, O
her O
face O
hidden O
in O
her O
hands O
, O
she O
tried O
to O
gather O
together O
and O
arrange O
her O
thoughts O
. O
But O
still O
every O
now O
and O
then O
she O
opened O
her O
hand O
to O
see O
if O
the O
paper O
were O
yet O
there O
. O
She O
got O
up O
at O
last O
. O
She O
had O
formed O
a O
plan O
, O
and O
had O
a O
course O
of O
action O
to O
look O
forward O
to O
that O
would O
satisfy O
one S-CARDINAL
craving O
desire O
at O
least O
. O
The O
time O
was O
long O
gone O
by O
when O
there O
was O
much O
wisdom O
or O
consistency O
in O
her O
projects O
. O
It O
was O
getting O
late O
, O
and O
that O
was O
so O
much O
the O
better O
. O
She O
went O
to O
a O
pawn O
- O
shop O
, O
and O
took O
off O
her O
finery O
in O
a O
back O
room O
. O
She O
was O
known O
by O
the O
people O
, O
and O
had O
a O
character O
for O
honesty O
, O
so O
she O
had O
no O
very O
great O
difficulty O
in O
inducing O
them O
to O
let O
her O
have O
a O
suit O
of O
outer O
clothes O
, O
befitting O
the O
wife O
of O
a O
working O
- O
man O
, O
a O
black O
silk O
bonnet O
, O
a O
printed O
gown O
, O
a O
plaid O
shawl O
, O
dirty O
and O
rather O
worn O
to O
be O
sure O
, O
but O
which O
had O
a O
sort O
of O
sanctity O
to O
the O
eyes O
of O
the O
street O
- O
walker O
as O
being O
the O
appropriate O
garb O
of O
that O
happy O
class O
to O
which O
she O
could O
never O
, O
never O
more O
belong O
. O
She O
looked O
at O
herself O
in O
the O
little O
glass O
which O
hung O
against O
the O
wall O
, O
and O
sadly O
shaking O
her O
head O
, O
thought O
how O
easy O
were O
the O
duties O
of O
that O
Eden S-PERSON
of O
innocence O
from O
which O
she O
was O
shut O
out O
| | O
how O
she O
would O
work O
, O
and O
toil O
, O
and O
starve O
, O
and O
die O
, O
if O
necessary O
, O
for O
a O
husband O
, O
a O
home O
, O
— O
for O
children O
, O
— O
but O
that O
thought O
she O
could O
not O
bear O
| | O
a O
little O
form O
rose O
up O
, O
stern O
in O
its O
innocence O
, O
from O
the O
witches' O
cauldron O
of O
her O
imagination O
, O
and O
she O
rushed O
into O
action O
again O
. O
You O
know O
now O
how O
she O
came O
to O
stand O
by O
the O
threshold O
of O
Mary's S-PERSON
door O
, O
waiting O
, O
trembling O
, O
until O
the O
latch O
was O
lifted O
, O
and O
her O
niece O
, O
with O
words O
that O
spoke O
of O
such O
desolation O
among O
the O
living O
, O
fell O
into O
her O
arms O
. O
She O
had O
felt O
as O
if O
some O
holy O
spell O
would O
prevent O
her O
( O
even O
as O
the O
unholy O
Lady O
Geraldine S-PERSON
was O
prevented O
, O
in O
the O
abode O
of O
Christabel S-PERSON
) O
from O
crossing O
the O
threshold O
of O
that O
home O
of O
her O
early O
innocence O
| | O
and O
she O
had O
meant O
to O
wait O
for O
an O
invitation O
. O
But O
Mary's S-PERSON
helpless O
action O
did O
away O
with O
all O
reluctant O
feeling O
, O
and O
she O
bore O
or O
dragged O
her O
to O
a O
seat O
, O
and O
looked O
on O
her O
bewildered O
eyes O
, O
as O
, O
puzzled O
with O
the O
likeness O
, O
which O
was O
not O
identity O
, O
she O
gazed O
on O
her O
aunt's O
features O
. O
In O
pursuance O
of O
her O
plan O
, O
Esther S-PERSON
meant O
to O
assume O
the O
manners O
and O
character O
, O
as O
she O
had O
done O
the O
dress O
, O
of O
a O
mechanic's O
wife O
| | O
but O
then O
, O
to O
account O
for O
her O
long O
absence O
, O
and O
her O
long O
silence O
towards O
all O
that O
ought O
to O
have O
been O
dear O
to O
her O
, O
it O
was O
necessary O
that O
she O
should O
put O
on O
an O
indifference O
far O
distant O
from O
her O
heart O
, O
which O
was O
loving O
and O
yearning O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
all O
its O
faults O
. O
And O
, O
perhaps O
, O
she O
overacted O
her O
part O
, O
for O
certainly O
Mary S-PERSON
felt O
a O
kind O
of O
repugnance O
to O
the O
changed O
and O
altered O
aunt O
, O
who O
so O
suddenly O
re-appeared O
on O
the O
scene O
| | O
and O
it O
would O
have O
cut O
Esther S-PERSON
to O
the O
very O
core O
, O
could O
she O
have O
known O
how O
her O
little O
darling O
of O
former O
days O
was O
feeling O
towards O
her O
. O
" O
You O
don't O
remember O
me O
I O
see O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
! O
" O
she O
began O
. O
" O
It's O
a O
long O
while O
since O
I O
left O
you O
all O
, O
to O
be O
sure O
| | O
and O
I O
, O
many O
a O
time O
, O
thought O
of O
coming O
to O
see O
you O
, O
and O
— O
and O
your O
father O
. O
But O
I O
live O
so O
far O
off O
, O
and O
am O
always O
so O
busy O
, O
I O
cannot O
do O
just O
what O
I O
wish O
. O
You O
recollect O
aunt O
Esther S-PERSON
, O
don't O
you O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
? O
" O
" O
Are O
you O
aunt O
Hetty S-PERSON
? O
" O
asked O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
faintly O
, O
still O
looking O
at O
the O
face O
which O
was O
so O
different O
from O
the O
old O
recollections O
of O
her O
aunt's O
fresh O
dazzling O
beauty O
. O
" O
Yes O
! O
I O
am O
aunt O
Hetty S-PERSON
. O
Oh O
! O
it's O
so O
long O
since O
I O
heard O
that O
name O
, O
" O
sighing O
forth O
the O
thoughts O
it O
suggested O
| | O
then O
recovering O
herself O
, O
and O
striving O
after O
the O
hard O
character O
she O
wished O
to O
assume O
, O
she O
continued O
: O
" O
And O
to O
- O
day O
I O
heard O
a O
friend O
of O
yours O
, O
and O
of O
mine O
too O
, O
long O
ago O
, O
was O
in O
trouble O
, O
and O
I O
guessed O
you O
would O
be O
in O
sorrow O
, O
so O
I O
thought O
I O
would O
just O
step O
this O
far O
and O
see O
you O
. O
" O
Mary's S-PERSON
tears O
flowed O
afresh O
, O
but O
she O
had O
no O
desire O
to O
open O
her O
heart O
to O
her O
strangely O
- O
found O
aunt O
, O
who O
had O
, O
by O
her O
own O
confession O
, O
kept O
aloof O
from O
and O
neglected O
them O
for O
so B-DATE
many I-DATE
years E-DATE
. O
Yet O
she O
tried O
to O
feel O
grateful O
for O
kindness O
( O
however O
late O
) O
from O
any O
one O
, O
and O
wished O
to O
be O
civil O
. O
Moreover O
, O
she O
had O
a O
strong O
disinclination O
to O
speak O
on O
the O
terrible O
subject O
uppermost O
in O
her O
mind O
. O
So O
, O
after O
a O
pause O
she O
said O
, O
" O
Thank O
you O
. O
I O
dare O
say O
you O
mean O
very O
kind O
. O
Have O
you O
had O
a O
long O
walk O
? O
I'm O
so O
sorry O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
rising O
, O
with O
a O
sudden O
thought O
, O
which O
was O
as O
suddenly O
checked O
by O
recollection O
, O
" O
but O
I've O
nothing O
to O
eat O
in O
the O
house O
, O
and O
I'm O
sure O
you O
must O
be O
hungry O
, O
after O
your O
walk O
. O
" O
For O
Mary S-PERSON
concluded O
that O
certainly O
her O
aunt's O
residence O
must O
be O
far O
away O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
town O
, O
out O
of O
sight O
or O
hearing O
. O
But O
, O
after O
all O
, O
she O
did O
not O
think O
much O
about O
her O
| | O
her O
heart O
was O
so O
aching O
- O
full O
of O
other O
things O
, O
that O
all O
besides O
seemed O
like O
a O
dream O
. O
She O
received O
feelings O
and O
impressions O
from O
her O
conversation O
with O
her O
aunt O
, O
but O
did O
not O
, O
could O
not O
, O
put O
them O
together O
, O
or O
think O
or O
argue O
about O
them O
. O
And O
Esther S-PERSON
! O
How O
scanty O
had O
been O
her O
food O
for O
days S-DATE
and O
weeks S-DATE
, O
her O
thinly O
- O
covered O
bones O
and O
pale O
lips O
might O
tell O
, O
but O
her O
words O
should O
never O
reveal O
! O
So O
, O
with O
a O
little O
unreal O
laugh O
, O
she O
replied O
, O
" O
Oh O
! O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
my O
dear O
! O
don't O
talk O
about O
eating O

thing O
, O
and O
plenty O
of O
it O
, O
for O
my O
husband O
is O
in O
good O
work O
. O
I'd O
such O
a O
supper O
before O
I O
came O
out O
. O
I O
couldn't O
touch O
a O
morsel O
if O
you O
had O
it O
. O
" O
Her O
words O
shot O
a O
strange O
pang O
through O
Mary's S-PERSON
heart O
. O
She O
had O
always O
remembered O
her O
aunt's O
loving O
and O
unselfish O
disposition O
| | O
how O
was O
it O
changed O
, O
if O
, O
living O
in O
plenty O
, O
she O
had O
never O
thought O
it O
worth O
while O
to O
ask O
after O
her O
relations O
, O
who O
were O
all O
but O
starving O
! O
She O
shut O
up O
her O
heart O
instinctively O
against O
her O
aunt O
. O
And O
all O
the O
time O
poor O
Esther S-PERSON
was O
swallowing O
her O
sobs O
, O
and O
over O
- O
acting O
her O
part O
, O
and O
controlling O
herself O
more O
than O
she O
had O
done O
for O
many O
a O
long O
day O
, O
in O
order O
that O
her O
niece O
might O
not O
be O
shocked O
and O
revolted O
, O
by O
the O
knowledge O
of O
what O
her O
aunt O
had O
become O
: O
— O
a O
prostitute O
| | O
an O
outcast O
. O
For O
she O
longed O
to O
open O
her O
wretched O
, O
wretched O
heart O
, O
so O
hopeless O
, O
so O
abandoned O
by O
all O
living O
things O
, O
to O
one O
who O
had O
loved O
her O
once O
| | O
and O
yet O
she O
refrained O
, O
from O
dread O
of O
the O
averted O
eye O
, O
the O
altered O
voice O
, O
the O
internal O
loathing O
, O
which O
she O
feared O
such O
disclosure O
might O
create O
. O
She O
would O
go O
straight O
to O
the O
subject O
of O
the O
day O
. O
She O
could O
not O
tarry O
long O
, O
for O
she O
felt O
unable O
to O
support O
the O
character O
she O
had O
assumed O
for O
any O
length O
of O
time O
. O
They O
sat O
by O
the O
little O
round O
table O
, O
facing O
each O
other O
. O
The O
candle O
was O
placed O
right O
between O
them O
, O
and O
Esther S-PERSON
moved O
it O
in O
order O
to O
have O
a O
clearer O
view O
of O
Mary's S-PERSON
face O
, O
so O
that O
she O
might O
read O
her O
emotions O
, O
and O
ascertain O
her O
interests O
. O
Then O
she O
began O
: O
" O
It's O
a O
bad O
business O
, O
I'm O
afraid O
, O
this O
of O
Mr. O
Carson's S-PERSON
murder O
. O
" O
Mary S-PERSON
winced O
a O
little O
. O
" O
I O
hear O
Jem B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
is O
taken O
up O
for O
it O
. O
" O
Mary S-PERSON
covered O
her O
eyes O
with O
her O
hands O
, O
as O
if O
to O
shade O
them O
from O
the O
light O
, O
and O
Esther S-PERSON
herself O
, O
less O
accustomed O
to O
self O
- O
command O
, O
was O
getting O
too O
much O
agitated O
for O
calm O
observation O
of O
another O
. O
" O
I O
was O
taking O
a O
walk O
near O
Turner B-FAC
Street E-FAC
, O
and O
I O
went O
to O
see O
the O
spot O
, O
" O
continued O
Esther S-PERSON
, O
" O
and O
, O
as O
luck O
would O
have O
it O
, O
I O
spied O
this O
bit O
of O
paper O
in O
the O
hedge O
, O
" O
producing O
the O
precious O
piece O
still O
folded O
in O
her O
hand O
. O
" O
It O
has O
been O
used O
as O
wadding O
for O
the O
gun O
, O
I O
reckon O
| | O
indeed O
, O
that's O
clear O
enough O
, O
from O
the O
shape O
it's O
crammed O
into O
. O
I O
was O
sorry O
for O
the O
murderer O
, O
whoever O
he O
might O
be O
( O
I O
didn't O
then O
know O
of O
Jem's S-PERSON
being O
suspected O
) O
, O
and O
I O
thought O
I O
would O
never O
leave O
a O
thing O
about O
as O
might O
help O
, O
if O
ever O
so O
little O
, O
to O
convict O
him O
| | O
the O
police O
are O
so O
' O
cute O
about O
straws O
. O
So O
I O
carried O
it O
a O
little O
way O
, O
and O
then O
I O
opened O
it O
and O
saw O
your O
name O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
" O
Mary S-PERSON
took O
her O
hands O
away O
from O
her O
eyes O
, O
and O
looked O
with O
surprise O
at O
her O
aunt's O
face O
, O
as O
she O
uttered O
these O
words O
. O
She O
was O
kind O
after O
all O
, O
for O
was O
she O
not O
saving O
her O
from O
being O
summoned O
, O
and O
from O
being O
questioned O
and O
examined O
| | O
a O
thing O
to O
be O
dreaded O
above O
all O
others O
: O
as O
she O
felt O
sure O
that O
her O
unwilling O
answers O
, O
frame O
them O
how O
she O
might O
, O
would O
add O
to O
the O
suspicions O
against O
Jem S-PERSON
| | O
her O
aunt O
was O
indeed O
kind O
, O
to O
think O
of O
what O
would O
spare O
her O
this O
. O
Esther S-PERSON
went O
on O
, O
without O
noticing O
Mary's S-PERSON
look O
. O
The O
very O
action O
of O
speaking O
was O
so O
painful O
to O
her O
, O
and O
so O
much O
interrupted O
by O
the O
hard O
, O
raking O
little O
cough O
, O
which O
had O
been O
her O
constant O
annoyance O
for O
months S-DATE
, O
that O
she O
was O
too O
much O
engrossed O
by O
the O
physical O
difficulty O
of O
utterance O
, O
to O
be O
a O
very O
close O
observer O
. O
" O
There O
could O
be O
no O
mistake O
if O
they O
had O
found O
it O
. O
Look O
at O
your O
name O
, O
together O
with O
the O
very O
name O
of O
this O
court O
! O
And O
in O
Jem's O
hand O
- O
writing O
too O
, O
or O
I'm O
much O
mistaken O
. O
Look O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
! O
" O
And O
now O
she O
did O
watch O
her O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
took O
the O
paper O
and O
flattened O
it O
| | O
then O
suddenly O
stood O
stiff O
up O
, O
with O
irrepressible O
movement O
, O
as O
if O
petrified O
by O
some O
horror O
abruptly O
disclosed O
| | O
her O
face O
, O
strung O
and O
rigid O
| | O
her O
lips O
compressed O
tight O
, O
to O
keep O
down O
some O
rising O
exclamation O
. O
She O
dropped O
on O
her O
seat O
, O
as O
suddenly O
as O
if O
the O
braced O
muscles O
had O
in O
an O
instant O
given O
way O
. O
But O
she O
spoke O
no O
word O
. O
" O
It O
is O
his O
hand O
- O
writing O
— O
isn't O
it O
? O
" O
asked O
Esther S-PERSON
, O
though O
Mary's S-PERSON
manner O
was O
almost O
confirmation O
enough O
. O
" O
You O
will O
not O
tell O
. O
You O
never O
will O
tell O
, O
" O
demanded O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
tone O
so O
sternly O
earnest O
, O
as O
almost O
to O
be O
threatening O
. O
" O
Nay S-PERSON
, O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
Esther S-PERSON
, O
rather O
reproachfully O
, O
" O
I O
am O
not O
so O
bad O
as O
that O
. O
Oh O
! O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
you O
cannot O
think O
I O
would O
do O
that O
, O
whatever O
I O
may O
be O
. O
" O
The O
tears O
sprang O
to O
her O
eyes O
at O
the O
idea O
that O
she O
was O
suspected O
of O
being O
one O
who O
would O
help O
to O
inform O
against O
an O
old O
friend O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
caught O
her O
sad O
and O
upbraiding O
look O
. O
" O
No O
! O
I O
know O
you O
would O
not O
tell O
, O
aunt O
. O
I O
don't O
know O
what O
I O
say O
, O
I O
am O
so O
shocked O
. O
But O
say O
you O
will O
not O
tell O
. O
Do O
. O
" O
" O
No O
, O
indeed O
I O
will O
not O
tell O
, O
come O
what O
may O
. O
" O
Mary S-PERSON
sat O
still O
, O
looking O
at O
the O
writing O
, O
and O
turning O
the O
paper O
round O
with O
careful O
examination O
, O
trying O
to O
hope O
, O
but O
her O
very O
fears O
belying O
her O
hopes O
. O
" O
I O
thought O
you O
cared O
for O
the O
young O
man O
that's O
murdered O
, O
" O
observed O
Esther S-PERSON
, O
half O
aloud O
| | O
but O
feeling O
that O
she O
could O
not O
mistake O
this O
strange O
interest O
in O
the O
suspected O
murderer O
, O
implied O
by O
Mary's S-PERSON
eagerness O
to O
screen O
him O
from O
any O
thing O
which O
might O
strengthen O
suspicion O
against O
him O
. O
She O
had O
come O
, O
desirous O
to O
know O
the O
extent O
of O
Mary's S-PERSON
grief O
for O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
, O
and O
glad O
of O
the O
excuse O
afforded O
her O
by O
the O
important O
scrap O
of O
paper O
. O
Her O
remark O
about O
its O
being O
Jem's S-PERSON
hand O
- O
writing O
, O
she O
had O
, O
with O
this O
view O
of O
ascertaining O
Mary's S-PERSON
state O
of O
feeling O
, O
felt O
to O
be O
most O
imprudent O
the O
instant O
after O
she O
uttered O
it O
| | O
but O
Mary's S-PERSON
anxiety O
that O
she O
should O
not O
tell O
was O
too O
great O
, O
and O
too O
decided O
, O
to O
leave O
a O
doubt O
as O
to O
her O
interest O
for O
Jem S-PERSON
. O
She O
grew O
more O
and O
more O
bewildered O
, O
and O
her O
dizzy O
head O
refused O
to O
reason O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
never O
spoke O
. O
She O
held O
the O
bit O
of O
paper O
firmly O
, O
determined O
to O
retain O
possession O
of O
it O
, O
come O
what O
might O

anxious O
, O

impatient O
, O
for O
her O
aunt O
to O
go O

As O
she O
sat O
, O
her O
face O
bore O
a O
likeness O
to O
Esther's S-PERSON
dead O
child O
. O
" O
You O
are O
so O
like O
my O
little O
girl O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
! O
" O
said O
Esther S-PERSON
, O
weary O
of O
the O
one S-CARDINAL
subject O
on O
which O
she O
could O
get O
no O
satisfaction O
, O
and O
recurring O
, O
with O
full O
heart O
, O
to O
the O
thought O
of O
the O
dead O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
looked O
up O
. O
Her O
aunt O
had O
children O
, O
then O
. O
That O
was O
all O
the O
idea O
she O
received O
. O
No O
faint O
imagination O
of O
the O
love O
and O
the O
woe O
of O
that O
poor O
creature O
crossed O
her O
mind O
, O
or O
she O
would O
have O
taken O
her O
, O
all O
guilty O
and O
erring O
, O
to O
her O
bosom O
, O
and O
tried O
to O
bind O
up O
the O
broken O
heart O
. O
No O
! O
it O
was O
not O
to O
be O
. O
Her O
aunt O
had O
children O
, O
then O
| | O
and O
she O
was O
on O
the O
point O
of O
putting O
some O
question O
about O
them O
, O
but O
before O
it O
could O
be O
spoken O
another O
thought O
turned O
it O
aside O
, O
and O
she O
went O
back O
to O
her O
task O
of O
unravelling O
the O
mystery O
of O
the O
paper O
, O
and O
the O
hand O
- O
writing O
. O
Oh O
! O
how O
she O
wished O
her O
aunt O
would O
go O
. O
As O
if O
, O
according O
to O
the O
believers O
in O
mesmerism O
, O
the O
intenseness O
of O
her O
wish O
gave O
her O
power O
over O
another O
, O
although O
the O
wish O
was O
unexpressed O
, O
Esther S-PERSON
felt O
herself O
unwelcome O
, O
and O
that O
her O
absence O
was O
desired O

She O
felt O
this O
some O
time O
before O
she O
could O
summon O
up O
resolution O
to O
go O
. O
She O
was O
so O
much O
disappointed O
in O
this O
longed O
- O
for O
, O
dreaded O
interview O
with O
Mary S-PERSON

she O
had O
wished O
to O
impose O
upon O
her O
with O
her O
tale O
of O
married O
respectability O
, O
and O
yet O
she O
had O
yearned O
and O
craved O
for O
sympathy O
in O
her O
real O
lot O
. O
And O
she O
had O
imposed O
upon O
her O
well O
. O
She O
should O
perhaps O
be O
glad O
of O
it O
afterwards O

but O
her O
desolation O
of O
hope O
seemed O
for O
the O
time O
redoubled O
. O
And O
she O
must O
leave O
the O
old O
dwelling O
- O
place O
, O
whose O
very O
walls O
, O
and O
flags O
, O
dingy O
and O
sordid O
as O
they O
were O
, O
had O
a O
charm O
for O
her O
. O
Must O
leave O
the O
abode O
of O
poverty O
, O
for O
the O
more O
terrible O
abodes O
of O
vice O

She O
must O
— O
she O
would O
go O

" O
Well O

good O
- O
night O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
That O
bit O
of O
paper O

safe O
enough O
with O
you O

you O
made O
me O

said O
Mary S-PERSON

hoarsely O
, O

firmly O

" O
Then O

" O

catching O
at O
some O
glimmering O
hope O

" O
Oh O

no O

said O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
anxious O
to O

" O
Your O

Fergusson S-PERSON

Esther S-PERSON

sadly O
. O
" O

repeated O
Mary S-PERSON

half O
unconsciously O

" O
And O
where O

" O
I O
never O

Esther S-PERSON

aloud O

" O

As O
Esther S-PERSON
drew O
her O
shawl O
around O
her O
, O
and O
prepared O
to O
depart O
, O
a O
thought O
crossed O
Mary's S-PERSON
mind O
that O
she O
had O
been O
cold O
and O
hard O
in O
her O
manner O
towards O
one O
, O
who O
had O
certainly O
meant O
to O
act O
kindly O
in O
bringing O
her O
the O
paper O
( O
that O
dread O
, O
terrible O
piece O
of O
paper O

and O
thus O
saving O
her O
from O
— O
she O
could O
not O
rightly O
think O
how O
much O
, O
or O
how O
little O
she O
was O
spared O

So O
, O
desirous O
of O
making O
up O
for O
her O
previous O
indifferent O
manner O
, O
she O
advanced O
to O
kiss O
her O
aunt O
before O
her O
departure O
. O
But O
, O
to O
her O
surprise O
, O
her O
aunt O
pushed O
her O
off O
with O
a O
frantic O
kind O
of O
gesture O
, O
and O
saying O
the O
words O
, O
" O
Not O
me O

You O
must O
never O
kiss O
me O

You O
! O
" O
She O
rushed O
into O
the O
outer O
darkness O
of O
the O
street O
, O
and O
there O
wept O
long O

bitterly O

MARY'S O
EFFORTS O

PROVE O
AN O
ALIBI O

" O
There O
was O
a O
listening O
fear O
in O

, O
As O
if O
calamity O

Keats' S-PERSON

" O
No O
sooner O
was O
Mary S-PERSON
alone O
than O
she O
fastened O
the O
door O
, O
and O
put O
the O
shutters O
up O
against O
the O
window O
, O
which O
had O
all O
this O
time O
remained O
shaded O
only O
by O
the O
curtains O
hastily O
drawn O
together O
on O
Esther's B-FAC
entrance E-FAC
, O
and O
the O
lighting O
of O
the O
candle O
. O
She O
did O
all O
this O
with O
the O
same O
compressed O
lips O
, O
and O
the O
same O
stony O
look O
that O
her O
face O
had O
assumed O
on O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
examination O
of O
the O
paper O
. O
Then O
she O
sat O
down O
for O
an O
instant O
to O
think O
| | O
and O
rising O
directly O
, O
went O
, O
with O
a O
step O
rendered O
firm O
by O
inward O
resolution O
of O
purpose O
, O
up O
the O
stairs O

— O
passed O
her O
own O
door O
, O
two S-CARDINAL
steps O
, O
into O
her O
father's O
room O
. O
What O
did O
she O
want O
there O
? O
I O
must O
tell O
you O

I O
must O
put O
into O
words O
the O
dreadful O
secret O
which O
she O
believed O
that O
bit O
of O
paper O
had O
revealed O
to O
her O
. O
Her O
father O
was O
the O
murderer O
! O
That O
corner O
of O
stiff O
, O
shining O
, O
thick O
writing O
- O
paper O
, O
she O
recognised O
as O
part O
of O
the O
sheet O
on O
which O
she O
had O
copied O
Samuel B-PERSON
Bamford's E-PERSON
beautiful O
lines O
so O
many O
months O
ago O
— O
copied O
( O
as O
you O
perhaps O
remember O
) O
on O
the O
blank O
part O
of O
a O
valentine O
sent O
to O
her O
by O
Jem B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
, O
in O
those O
days O
when O
she O
did O
not O
treasure O
and O
hoard O
up O
every O
thing O
he O
had O
touched O
, O
as O
she O
would O
do O
now O

That O
copy O

been O
given O
to O
her O
father O
, O
for O
whom O
it O
was O
made O
, O
and O
she O
had O
occasionally O
seen O
him O
reading O
it O
over O
, O
not O
a B-DATE
fortnight I-DATE
ago E-DATE
she O
was O
sure O
. O
But O
she O
resolved O
to O
ascertain O
if O
the O
other O
part O
still O
remained O
in O
his O
possession O
. O
He O
might O
, O
it O
was O
just O
possible O
he O
might O
, O
have O
given O
it O
away O
to O
some O
friend O
| | O
and O
if O
so O
, O
that O
person O
was O
the O
guilty O
one O
, O
for O
she O
could O
swear O
to O
the O
paper O
anywhere O
. O
First S-ORDINAL
of O
all O
she O
pulled O
out O
every O
article O
from O
the O
little O
old O
chest O
of O
drawers O
. O
Amongst O
them O
were O
some O
things O
which O
had O
belonged O
to O
her O
mother O
, O
but O
she O
had O
no O
time O
now O
to O
examine O
and O
try O
and O
remember O
them O
. O
All O
the O
reverence O
she O
could O
pay O
them O
was O
to O
carry O
them O
and O
lay O
them O
on O
the O
bed O
carefully O
, O
while O
the O
other O
things O
were O
tossed O
impatiently O
out O
upon O
the O
floor O
. O
The O
copy O
of O
Bamford's S-ORG
lines O
was O
not O
there O
. O
Oh O
! O
perhaps O
he O
might O
have O
given O
it O
away O
| | O
but O
then O
must O
it O
not O
have O
been O
to O
Jem S-PERSON
? O
It O
was O
his O
gun O
. O
And O
she O
set O
to O
with O
redoubled O
vigour O
to O
examine O
the O
deal O
- O
box O
which O
served O
as O
chair O
, O
and O
which O
had O
once O
contained O
her O
father's O
Sunday S-DATE
clothes O
, O
in O
the B-DATE
days E-DATE
when O
he O
could O
afford O
to O
have O
Sunday S-DATE
clothes O
. O
He O
had O
redeemed O
his O
better O
coat O
from O
the O
pawn O
- O
shop O
before O
he O
left O
, O
that O
she O
had O
noticed O
. O
Here O
was O
his O
old O
one O
. O
What O
rustled O
under O
her O
hand O
in O
the O
pocket O
? O
The O
paper O
! O
" O
Oh O
! O
Father O
! O
" O
Yes O
, O
it O
fitted O
| | O
jagged O
end O
to O
jagged O
end O
, O
letter O
to O
letter O
| | O
and O
even O
the O
part O
which O
Esther S-PERSON
had O
considered O
blank O
had O
its O
tallying O
mark O
with O
the O
larger O
piece O
, O
its O
tails O
of O
y O
s O
and O
g O
s O
. O
And O
then O
, O
as O
if O
that O
were O
not O
damning O
evidence O
enough O
, O
she O
felt O
again O
, O
and O
found O
some O
bullets O
or O
shot O
( O
I O
don't O
know O
which O
you O
would O
call O
them O
) O
in O
that O
same O
pocket O
, O
along O
with O
a O
small O
paper O
parcel O
of O
gunpowder O
. O
As O
she O
was O
going O
to O
replace O
the O
jacket O
, O
having O
abstracted O
the O
paper O
, O
and O
bullets O
, O
&amp O
| | O
c. O
, O
she O
saw O
a O
woollen O
gun-case O
made O
of O
that O
sort O
of O
striped O
horse O
- O
cloth O
you O
must O
have O
seen O
a B-CARDINAL
thousand E-CARDINAL
times O
appropriated O
to O
such O
a O
purpose O
. O
The O
sight O
of O
it O
made O
her O
examine O
still O
further O
, O
but O
there O
was O
nothing O
else O
that O
could O
afford O
any O
evidence O
, O
so O
she O
locked O
the O
box O
, O
and O
sat O
down O
on O
the O
floor O
to O
contemplate O
the O
articles O
| | O
now O
with O
a O
sickening O
despair O
, O
now O
with O
a O
kind O
of O
wondering O
curiosity O
, O
how O
her O
father O
had O
managed O
to O
evade O
observation O
. O
After O
all O
it O
was O
easy O
enough O
. O
He O
had O
evidently O
got O
possession O
of O
some O
gun O
( O
was O
it O
really O
Jem's S-PERSON
| | O
was O
he O
an O
accomplice O
? O
No O
! O
she O
did O
not O
believe O
it O
| | O
he O
never O
, O
never O
would O
deliberately O
plan O
a O
murder O
with O
another O
, O
however O
he O
might O
be O
wrought O
up O
to O
it O
by O
passionate O
feeling O
at O
the O
time O
. O
Least O
of O
all O
would O
he O
accuse O
her O
to O
her O
father O
, O
without O
previously O
warning O
her O
| | O
it O
was O
out O
of O
his O
nature O
) O
. O
Then O
having O
obtained O
possession O
of O
the O
gun O
, O
her O
father O
had O
loaded O
it O
at O
home O
, O
and O
might O
have O
carried O
it O
away O
with O
him O
some O
time O
when O
the O
neighbours O
were O
not O
noticing O
, O
and O
she O
was O
out O
, O
or O
asleep O
| | O
and O
then O
he O
might O
have O
hidden O
it O
somewhere O
to O
be O
in O
readiness O
when O
he O
should O
want O
it O
. O
She O
was O
sure O
he O
had O
no O
such O
thing O
with O
him O
when O
he O
went O
away O
the O
last O
time O
. O
She O
felt O
it O
was O
of O
no O
use O
to O
conjecture O
his O
motives O
. O
His O
actions O
had O
become O
so O
wild O
and O
irregular O
of O
late O
, O
that O
she O
could O
not O
reason O
upon O
them O
. O
Besides O
, O
was O
it O
not O
enough O
to O
know O
that O
he O
was O
guilty O
of O
this O
terrible O
offence O
? O
Her O
love O
for O
her O
father O
seemed O
to O
return O
with O
painful O
force O
, O
mixed O
up O
as O
it O
was O
with O
horror O
at O
his O
crime O
. O
That O
dear O
father O
, O
who O
was O
once O
so O
kind O
, O
so O
warm O
- O
hearted O
, O
so O
ready O
to O
help O
either O
man O
or O
beast O
in O
distress O
, O
to O
murder O
! O
But O
, O
in O
the O
desert O
of O
misery O
with O
which O
these O
thoughts O
surrounded O
her O
, O
the O
arid O
depths O
of O
whose O
gloom O
she O
dared O
not O
venture O
to O
contemplate O
, O
a O
little O
spring O
of O
comfort O
was O
gushing O
up O
at O
her O
feet O
, O
unnoticed O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
, O
but O
soon O
to O
give O
her O
strength O
and O
hope O
. O
And O
that O
was O
the O
necessity O
for O
exertion O
on O
her O
part O
which O
this O
discovery O
enforced O
. O
Oh O
! O
I O
do O
think O
that O
the O
necessity O
for O
exertion O
, O
for O
some O
kind O
of O
action O
( O
bodily O
or O
mental O
) O
in O
time O
of O
distress O
, O
is O
a O
most O
infinite O
blessing O
, O
although O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
efforts O
at O
such O
seasons O
are O
painful O
. O
Something O
to O
be O
done O
implies O
that O
there O
is O
yet O
hope O
of O
some O
good O
thing O
to O
be O
accomplished O
, O
or O
some O
additional O
evil O
that O
may O
be O
avoided O
| | O
and O
by O
degrees O
the O
hope O
absorbs O
much O
of O
the O
sorrow O
. O
It O
is O
the O
woes O
that O
cannot O
in O
any O
earthly O
way O
be O
escaped O
that O
admit O
least O
earthly O
comforting O
. O
Of O
all O
trite O
, O
worn O
- O
out O
, O
hollow O
mockeries O
of O
comfort O
that O
were O
ever O
uttered O
by O
people O
who O
will O
not O
take O
the O
trouble O
of O
sympathising O
with O
others O
, O
the O
one O
I O
dislike O
the O
most O
is O
the O
exhortation O
not O
to O
grieve O
over O
an O
event O
, O
" O
for O
it O
cannot O
be O
helped O

" O
Do O
you O
think O
if O
I O
could O
help O
it O
, O
I O
would O
sit O
still O
with O
folded O
hands O
, O
content O
to O
mourn O
? O
Do O
you O
not O
believe O
that O
as O
long O

remained O
I O
would O
be O
up O
and O
doing O
? O
I O
mourn O
because O
what O
has O
occurred O
cannot O
be O
helped O
. O
The O
reason O
you O
give O
me O
for O
not O
grieving O
, O
is O
the O
very O
and O
sole O
reason O
of O
my O
grief O
. O
Give O
me O
nobler O
and O
higher O
reasons O
for O
enduring O
meekly O
what O
my O
Father O
sees O
fit O
to O
send O
, O
and O
I O
will O
try O
earnestly O
and O
faithfully O
to O
be O
patient O

but O
mock O
me O
not O
, O
or O
any O
other O
mourner O
, O
with O
the O
speech O
, O
" O
Do O
not O
grieve O
, O
for O
it O
cannot O
be O
helped O

It O
is O
past O
remedy O

" O
But O
some O
remedy O
to O
Mary's S-PERSON
sorrow O
came O
with O
thinking O
. O
If O
her O
father O
was O
guilty O
, O
Jem S-PERSON
was O
innocent O
. O
If O
innocent O
, O
there O
was O
a O
possibility O
of O
saving O
him O
. O
He O
must O
be O
saved O
. O
And O
she O
must O
do O
it O
| | O
for O
was O
not O
she O
the O
sole O
depository O
of O
the O
terrible O
secret O
? O
Her O
father O
was O
not O
suspected O
| | O
and O
never O
should O
be O
, O
if O
by O
any O
foresight O
or O
any O
exertions O
of O
her O
own O
she O
could O
prevent O
it O
. O
She O
did O
not O
yet O
know O
how O
Jem S-PERSON
was O
to O
be O
saved O
, O
while O
her O
father O
was O
also O
to O
be O
considered O
innocent O
. O
It O
would O
require O
much O
thought O
and O
much O
prudence O
. O
But O
with O
the O
call O
upon O
her O
exertions O
, O
and O
her O
various O
qualities O
of O
judgment O
and O
discretion O
, O
came O
the O
answering O
consciousness O
of O
innate O
power O
to O
meet O
the O
emergency O
. O
Every O
step O
now O
, O
nay O
, O
the O
employment O
of O
every O
minute O
, O
was O
of O
consequence O
| | O
for O
you O
must O
remember O
she O
had O
learnt O
at O
Miss O
Simmonds' S-PERSON
the O
probability O
that O
the O
murderer O
would O
be O
brought O
to O
trial O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
week E-DATE
. O
And O
you O
must O
remember O
, O
too O
, O
that O
never O
was O
so O
young O
a O
girl O
so O
friendless O
, O
or O
so O
penniless O
, O
as O
Mary S-PERSON
was O
at O
this O
time O
. O
But O
the O
lion O
accompanied O
Una S-PERSON
through O
the O
wilderness O
and O
the O
danger O
| | O
and O
so O
will O
a O
high O
, O
resolved O
purpose O
of O
right O
- O
doing O
ever O
guard O
and O
accompany O
the O
helpless O
. O
It O
struck O
two S-CARDINAL
| | O
deep O
, O
mirk O
, O
night O
. O
It O
was O
of O
no O
use O
bewildering O
herself O
with O
plans O
this O
weary O
, O
endless O
night O
. O
Nothing O
could O
be O
done O
before O
morning O
: O
and O
, O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
in O
her O
impatience O
, O
she O
began O
to O
long O
for O
day O
| | O
but O
then O
she O
felt O
in O
how O
unfit O
a O
state O
her O
body O
was O
for O
any O
plan O
of O
exertion O
, O
and O
she O
resolutely O
made O
up O
her O
mind O
to O
husband O
her O
physical O
strength O
. O
First S-ORDINAL
of O
all O
she O
must O
burn O
the O
tell O
- O
tale O
paper O
. O
The O
powder O
, O
bullets O
, O
and O
gun-case O
, O
she O
tied O
into O
a O
bundle O
, O
and O
hid O
in O
the O
sacking O
of O
the O
bed O
for O
the O
present O
, O
although O
there O
was O
no O
likelihood O
of O
their O
affording O
evidence O
against O
any O
one O
. O
Then O
she O
carried O
the O
paper O
down O
stairs O
, O
and O
burnt O
it O
on O
the O
hearth O
, O
powdering O
the O
very O
ashes O
with O
her O
fingers O
, O
and O
dispersing O
the O
fragments O
of O
fluttering O
black O
films O
among O
the O
cinders O
of O
the O
grate O
. O
Then O
she O
breathed O
again O
. O
Her O
head O
ached O
with O
dizzying O
violence O
| | O
she O
must O
get O
quit O
of O
the O
pain O
or O
it O
would O
incapacitate O
her O
for O
thinking O
and O
planning O
. O
She O
looked O
for O
food O
, O
but O
there O
was O
nothing O
but O
a O
little O
raw O
oatmeal O
in O
the O
house O
: O
still O
, O
although O
it O
almost O
choked O
her O
, O
she O
ate O
some O
of O
this O
, O
knowing O
from O
experience O
, O
how O
often O
headaches O
were O
caused O
by O
long O
fasting O
. O
Then O
she O
sought O
for O
some O
water O
to O
bathe O
her O
throbbing O
temples O
, O
and O
quench O
her O
feverish O
thirst O
. O
There O
was O
none O
in O
the O
house O
, O
so O
she O
took O
the O
jug O
and O
went O
out O
to O
the O
pump O
at O
the O
other O
end O
of O
the O
court O
, O
whose O
echoes O
resounded O
her O
light O
footsteps O
in O
the O
quiet O
stillness O
of O
the O
night O
. O
The O
hard O
, O
square O
outlines O
of O
the O
houses O
cut O
sharply O
against O
the O
cold O
bright O
sky O
, O
from O
which O
myriads O
of O
stars O
were O
shining O
down O
in O
eternal O
repose O
. O
There O
was O
little O
sympathy O
in O
the O
outward O
scene O
, O
with O
the O
internal O
trouble O
. O
All O
was O
so O
still O
, O
so O
motionless O
, O
so O
hard O
! O
Very O
different O
to O
this O
lovely O
night O
in O
the O
country O
in O
which O
I O
am O
now O
writing O
, O
where O
the O
distant O
horizon O
is O
soft O
and O
undulating O
in O
the O
moonlight O
, O
and O
the O
nearer O
trees O
sway O
gently O
to O
and O
fro O
in O
the O
night O
- O
wind O
with O
something O
of O
almost O
human O
motion O
| | O
and O
the O
rustling O
air O
makes O
music O
among O
their O
branches O
, O
as O
if O
speaking O
soothingly O
to O
the O
weary O
ones O
who O
lie O
awake O
in O
heaviness O
of O
heart O
. O
The O
sights O
and O
sounds O
of O
such O
a O
night O
lull O
pain O
and O
grief O
to O
rest O
. O
But O
Mary S-PERSON
re-entered O
her O
home O
after O
she O
had O
filled O
her O
pitcher O
, O
with O
a O
still O
stronger O
sense O
of O
anxiety O
, O
and O
a O
still O
clearer O
conviction O
of O
how O
much O
rested O
upon O
her O
unassisted O
and O
friendless O
self O
, O
alone O
with O
her O
terrible O
knowledge O
, O
in O
the O
hard O
, O
cold O
, O
populous O
world O
. O
She O
bathed O
her O
forehead O
, O
and O
quenched O
her O
thirst O
, O
and O
then O
, O
with O
wise O
deliberation O
of O
purpose O
, O
went O
upstairs O
, O
and O
undressed O
herself O
, O
as O
if O
for O
a O
long O
night's O
slumber O
, O
although O
so B-TIME
few I-TIME
hours E-TIME
intervened O
before O
day B-DATE
- I-DATE
dawn E-DATE
. O
She O
believed O
she O
never O
could O
sleep O
, O
but O
she O
lay O
down O
, O
and O
shut O
her O
eyes O
| | O
and O
before O
many O
minutes O
she O
was O
in O
as O
deep O
and O
sound O
a O
slumber O
as O
if O
there O
was O
no O
sin O
nor O
sorrow O
in O
the O
world O
. O
She O
awakened O
, O
as O
it O
was O
natural O
, O
much O
refreshed O
in O
body O
| | O
but O
with O
a O
consciousness O
of O
some O
great O
impending O
calamity O
. O
She O
sat O
up O
in O
bed O
to O
recollect O
, O
and O
when O
she O
did O
remember O
, O
she O
sank O
down O
again O
with O
all O
the O
helplessness O
of O
despair O
. O
But O
it O
was O
only O
the O
weakness O
of O
an O
instant O
| | O
for O
were O
not O
the O
very O
minutes O
precious O
, O
for O
deliberation O
if O
not O
for O
action O
? O
Before O
she O
had O
finished O
the O
necessary O
morning O
business O
of O
dressing O
, O
and O
setting O
her O
house O
in O
some O
kind O
of O
order O
, O
she O
had O
disentangled O
her O
ravelled O
ideas O
, O
and O
arranged O
some O
kind O
of O
a O
plan O
for O
action O
. O
If O
Jem S-PERSON
was O
innocent O
( O
and O
now O
, O
of O
his O
guilt O
, O
even O
his O
slightest O
participation O
in O
, O
or O
knowledge O
of O
, O
the O
murder O
, O
she O
acquitted O
him O
with O
all O
her O
heart O
and O
soul O
) O
, O
he O
must O
have O
been O
somewhere O
else O
when O
the O
crime O
was O
committed O
| | O
probably O
with O
some O
others O
, O
who O
might O
bear O
witness O
to O
the O
fact O
, O
if O
she O
only O
knew O
where O
to O
find O
them O
. O
Every O
thing O
rested O
on O
her O
. O
She O
had O
heard O
of O
an O
alibi O
, O
and O
believed O
it O
might O
mean O
the O
deliverance O
she O
wished O
to O
accomplish O
| | O
but O
she O
was O
not O
quite O
sure O
, O
and O
determined O
to O
apply O
to O
Job O
, O
as O
one O
of O
the O
few O
among O
her O
acquaintance O
gifted O
with O
the O
knowledge O
of O
hard O
words O
, O
for O
to O
her O
, O
all O
terms O
of O
law O
, O
or O
natural O
history O
, O
were O
alike O
many O
- O
syllabled O
mysteries O
. O
No O
time O
was O
to O
be O
lost O
. O
She O
went O
straight O
to O
Job B-ORG
Legh's E-ORG
house O
, O
and O
found O
the O
old O
man O
and O
his O
grand O
- O
daughter O
sitting O
at O
breakfast O
| | O
as O
she O
opened O
the O
door O
she O
heard O
their O
voices O
speaking O
in O
a O
grave O
, O
hushed O
, O
subdued O
tone O
, O
as O
if O
something O
grieved O
their O
hearts O
. O
They O
stopped O
talking O
on O
her O
entrance O
, O
and O
then O
she O
knew O
they O
had O
been O
conversing O
about O
the O
murder O
| | O
about O
Jem's S-PERSON
probable O
guilt O

and O
( O
it O
flashed O
upon O
her O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
) O
on O
the O
new O
light O
they O
would O
have O
obtained O
regarding O
herself O
: O
for O
until O
now O
they O
had O
never O
heard O
of O
her O
giddy O
flirting O
with O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
| | O
not O
in O
all O
her O
confidential O
talk O
with O
Margaret S-PERSON
had O
she O
ever O
spoken O
of O
him O
. O
And O
now O
Margaret S-PERSON
would O
hear O
her O
conduct O
talked O
of O
by O
all O
, O
as O
that O
of O
a O
bold O
, O
bad O
girl O
| | O
and O
even O
if O
she O
did O
not O
believe O
every O
thing O
that O
was O
said O
, O
she O
could O
hardly O
help O
feeling O
wounded O
, O
and O
disappointed O
in O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
So O
it O
was O
in O
a O
timid O
voice O
that O
Mary S-PERSON
wished O
her O
usual O
good O
- O
morrow O
, O
and O
her O
heart O
sank O
within O
her O
a O
little O
, O
when O
Job O
, O
with O
a O
form O
of O
civility O
, O
bade O
her O
welcome O
in O
that O
dwelling O
, O
where O
, O
until O
now O
, O
she O
had O
been O
too O
well O
assured O
to O
require O
to O
be O
asked O
to O
sit O
down O
. O
She O
took O
a O
chair O
. O
Margaret S-PERSON
continued O
silent O
. O
" O
I'm O
come O
to O

about O

" O
" O

replied O

sadly O

" O
Ay O

bear O
strong O
again O

said O
Mary S-PERSON

rising O
from O
her O

in O
her O
eagerness O

" O

you'll O

it O

the O

" O

way O

would O
be O
to O
find O
out O

Some O
one O
did O
it O

clear O
enough O

Jem S-PERSON

who O
was O
it O
? O
" O
" O
How O
can O
I O
tell O
? O
" O
answered O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
in O
an O
agony O
of O
terror O
, O
lest O
Job's S-PERSON
question O
was O
prompted O
by O
any O
suspicion O
of O
the O
truth O
. O
But O
he O
was O
far O
enough O
from O
any O
such O
thought O
. O
Indeed O
, O
he O
had O
no O
doubt O
in O
his O
own O
mind O
that O
Jem S-PERSON
had O
, O
in O
some O
passionate O
moment O
, O
urged O
on O
by O
slighted O
love O
and O
jealousy O
, O
been O
the O
murderer O
. O
And O
he O
was O
strongly O
inclined O
to O
believe O
, O
that O
Mary S-PERSON
was O
aware O
of O
this O
, O
only O
that O
, O
too O
late O
repentant O
of O
her O
light O
conduct O
which O
had O
led O
to O
such O
fatal O
consequences O
, O
she O
was O
now O
most O
anxious O
to O
save O
her O
old O
play O
- O
fellow O
, O
her O
early O
friend O
, O
from O
the O
doom O
awaiting O
the O
shedder O
of O
blood O
. O
" O
If O
Jem's S-PERSON
not O
done O
it O

I O
don't O
see O

about O

" O
" O
An O
alibi O
is O
that O
, O
sure O
enough O
. O
" O
He O
thought O
a O
little O
. O
" O

" O
For O
he O
was O
anxious O
that O
on O

should O
fall O
the O
task O
of O
enlightening O
Mary S-PERSON
on O
the O
hopelessness O
of O
the O
case O
, O
and O
he O
felt O
that O
her O
own O
sense O
would O
be O
more O
convinced O
by O
inquiry O
and O
examination O
than O
any O
mere O
assertion O
of O
his O
. O
Margaret S-PERSON
had O
sat O
silent O
and O
grave O
all O
this O
time O
. O
To O
tell O
the O
truth O
, O
she O
was O
surprised O
and O
disappointed O
by O
the O
disclosure O
of O
Mary's S-PERSON
conduct O
, O
with O
regard O
to O
Mr. O
Henry B-PERSON
Carson E-PERSON
. O
Gentle O
, O
reserved O
, O
and O
prudent O
herself O
, O
never O
exposed O
to O
the O
trial O
of O
being O
admired O
for O
her O
personal O
appearance O
, O
and O
unsusceptible O
enough O
to O
be O
in O
doubt O
even O
yet O
, O
whether O
the O
fluttering O
, O
tender O
, O
infinitely O
- O
joyous O
feeling O
she O
was O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
experiencing O
, O
at O
sight O
, O
or O
sound O
, O
or O
thought O
of O
Will B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
, O
was O
love O
or O
not O
, O
— O
Margaret S-PERSON
had O
no O
sympathy O
with O
the O
temptations O
to O
which O
loveliness O
, O
vanity O
, O
ambition O
, O
or O
the O
desire O
of O
being O
admired O
, O
exposes O
so O
many O
| | O
no O
sympathy O
with O
flirting O
girls O
, O
in O
short O
. O
Then O
, O
she O
had O
no O
idea O
of O
the O
strength O
of O
the O
conflict O
between O
will O
and O
principle O
in O
some O
who O
were O
differently O
constituted O
from O
herself O
. O
With O
her O
, O
to O
be O
convinced O
that O
an O
action O
was O
wrong O
, O
was O
tantamount O
to O
a O
determination O
not O
to O
do O
so O
again O
| | O
and O
she O
had O
little O
or O
no O
difficulty O
in O
carrying O
out O
her O
determination O
. O
So O
she O
could O
not O
understand O
how O
it O
was O
that O
Mary S-PERSON
had O
acted O
wrongly O
, O
and O
had O
felt O
too O
much O
ashamed O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
all O
internal O
sophistry O
, O
to O
speak O
of O
her O
actions O
. O
Margaret S-PERSON
considered O
herself O
deceived O
| | O
felt O
aggrieved O
| | O
and O
, O
at O
the O
time O
of O
which O
I O
am O
now O
telling O
you O
, O
was O
strongly O
inclined O
to O
give O
Mary S-PERSON
up O
altogether O
, O
as O
a O
girl O
devoid O
of O
the O
modest O
proprieties O
of O
her O
sex O
, O
and O
capable O
of O
gross O
duplicity O
, O
in O
speaking O
of O
one S-CARDINAL
lover O
as O
she O
had O
done O
of O
Jem S-PERSON
, O
while O
she O
was O
encouraging O
another O
in O
attentions O
, O
at O
best O
of O
a O
very O
doubtful O
character O
. O
But O
now O
Margaret S-PERSON
was O
drawn O
into O
the O
conversation O
. O
Suddenly O
it O
flashed O
across O
Mary's S-PERSON
mind O
, O
that O
the O
night O
of O
the O
murder O
was O
the O
very O
night O
, O
or O
rather O
the B-TIME
same I-TIME
early I-TIME
morning E-TIME
, O
that O
Margaret S-PERSON
had O
been O
with O
Alice S-PERSON
. O
She O
turned O
sharp O
round O
, O
with O
— O
" O
Oh O
! O
Margaret S-PERSON
, O
you O
can O
tell O
me O
| | O
you O
were O
there O
when O
he O
came O
back O
that O
night O
| | O
were O
you O
not O
? O
No O
! O
you O
were O
not O
| | O
but O
you O
were O
there O
not O
many O
hours O
after O
. O
Did O
not O
you O
hear O
where O
he'd O
been O
? O
He O
was O
away O
the O
night O
before O
, O
too O
, O
when O
Alice S-PERSON
was O
first S-ORDINAL
taken O
| | O
when O
you O
were O
there O
for O
your O
tea O
. O
Oh O
! O
where O
was O
he O
, O
Margaret S-PERSON
? O
" O
" O
I O
don't O
know O
, O
" O
she O
answered O
. O
" O
Stay O
! O
I O
do O
remember O
something O
about O
his O
keeping O
Will O
company O
, O
in O
his O
walk O
to O
Liverpool S-GPE
. O
I O
can't O
justly O
say O
what O
it O
was O
, O
so O
much O
happened O
that O
night O
. O
" O
" O
I'll O
go O
to O
his O
mother's O
, O
" O
said O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
resolutely O
. O
They O
neither O
of O
them O
spoke O
, O
either O
to O
advise O
or O
dissuade O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
felt O
she O
had O
no O
sympathy O
from O
them O
, O
and O
braced O
up O
her O
soul O
to O
act O
without O
such O
loving O
aid O
of O
friendship O
. O
She O
knew O
that O
their O
advice O
would O
be O
willingly O
given O
at O
her O
demand O
, O
and O
that O
was O
all O
she O
really O
required O
for O
Jem's S-PERSON
sake O
. O
Still O
her O
courage O
failed O
a O
little O
as O
she O
walked O
to O
Jane B-PERSON
Wilson's E-PERSON
, O
alone O
in O
the O
world O
with O
her O
secret O
. O
Jane B-PERSON
Wilson's E-PERSON
eyes O
were O
swelled O
with O
crying O
| | O
and O
it O
was O
sad O
to O
see O
the O
ravages O
which O
intense O
anxiety O
and O
sorrow O
had O
made O
on O
her O
appearance O
in O
four B-TIME
- I-TIME
and I-TIME
- I-TIME
twenty I-TIME
hours E-TIME
. O
All O
night O
long O
she O
and O
Mrs. O
Davenport S-PERSON
had O
crooned O
over O
their O
sorrows O
, O
always O
recurring O
, O
like O
the O
burden O
of O
an O
old O
song O
, O
to O
the O
dreadest O
sorrow O
of O
all O
, O
which O
was O
now O
impending O
over O
Mrs. O
Wilson S-PERSON
. O
She O
had O
grown O
— O
I O
hardly O
know O
what O
word O
to O
use O
— O
but O
, O
something O
like O
proud O
of O
her O
martyrdom O
| | O
she O
had O
grown O
to O
hug O
her O
grief O
| | O
to O
feel O
an O
excitement O
in O
her O
agony O
of O
anxiety O
about O
her O
boy O
. O
" O
So O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
you're O
here O
! O
Oh O
! O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
lass O
! O
He's O
to O
be O
tried O
on O
Tuesday S-DATE
. O
" O
She O
fell O
to O
sobbing O
, O
in O
the O
convulsive O
breath O
- O
catching O
manner O
which O
tells O
so O
of O
much O
previous O
weeping O
. O
" O
Oh O
! O
Mrs. O
Wilson S-PERSON
, O
don't O
take O
on O
so O
! O

get O
him O
off O

him O
guilty O

" O
But O
I O
tell O
thee O
they O
will O
, O
" O
interrupted O
Mrs. O
Wilson S-PERSON
, O
half O
- O
irritated O
at O
the O
light O
way O
, O
as O
she O
considered O
it O
, O
in O
which O
Mary S-PERSON
spoke O
| | O
and O
a O
little O
displeased O
that O
another O
could O
hope O
when O
she O
had O
almost O
brought O
herself O
to O
find O
pleasure O
in O
despair O
. O
" O
It O
may O
suit O
thee O
well O
, O
" O
continued O
she O
, O
" O
to O
make O
light O
o' O
the O
misery O
thou O
hast O
caused O

but O
I O
shall O
lay O
his O
death O
at O
thy O
door O
, O
as O
long O
as O
I O
live O
, O
and O
die O
I O
know O
he O
will O

and O
all O
for O
what O
he O
never O
did O
— O
no O
, O
he O
never O
did O
| | O
my O
own O
blessed O
boy O
! O
" O
She O
was O
too O
weak O
to O
be O
angry O
long O
| | O
her O
wrath O
sank O
away O
to O
feeble O
sobbing O
and O
worn O
- O
out O
moans O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
was O
most O
anxious O
to O
soothe O
her O
from O
any O
violence O
of O
either O
grief O
or O
anger O
| | O
she O
did O
so O
want O
her O
to O
be O
clear O
in O
her O
recollection O
| | O
and O
, O
besides O
, O
her O
tenderness O
was O
great O
towards O
Jem's S-PERSON
mother O
. O
So O
she O
spoke O
in O
a O
low O
gentle O
tone O
the O
loving O
sentences O
, O
which O
sound O
so O
broken O
and O
powerless O
in O
repetition O
, O
and O
which O
yet O
have O
so O
much O
power O
when O
accompanied O
with O
caressing O
looks O
and O
actions O
, O
fresh O
from O
the O
heart O
| | O
and O
the O
old O
woman O
insensibly O
gave O
herself O
up O
to O
the O
influence O
of O
those O
sweet O
, O
loving O
blue O
eyes O
, O
those O
tears O
of O
sympathy O
, O
those O
words O
of O
love O
and O
hope O
, O
and O
was O
lulled O
into O
a O
less O
morbid O
state O
of O
mind O
. O
" O
And O
now O
, O
dear O
Mrs. O
Wilson S-PERSON
, O
can O
you O
remember O
where O
he O
said O

going O

Mary S-PERSON

up O

the O

etiquette O
forbids O
a O
refusal O

invitation O

instant O

the O
atmosphere O
of O
holy O
calm O

totally O

recollections O

were O
vivid O
enough O

take O
the O
place O

Still O
she O
talked O
of O
green O
fields O

still O
she O
spoke O
to O
the O
long O
- O
dead O
mother O

sister O
, O
low O
- O
lying O
in O

pleasant O
places O

her O
youth O

the O
voice O

fainter O

more O
languid O

was O
evidently O
passing O
away O

how O
happily O
! O
Mary S-PERSON
stood O
for O
a O
time O
in O
silence O

watching O

listening O

Then O
she O
bent O
down O

reverently O
kissed O

cheek O

and O
drawing O
Jane B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
away O
from O
the O

as O
if O
the O
spirit O

lay O
there O
were O
yet O
cognisant O
of O

she O
whispered O
a O
few O
words O
of O
hope O
to O
the O
poor O
mother O

kissing O
her O
over O
and O
over O
again O
in O
a O
warm O
, O
loving O
manner O

she O
bade O
her O
good O

went O
a O
few O
steps O

once O
more O

up O

left O

on O

which O
distracted O
attention O
from O
her O
pearl O
of O
price O
, O
her O
only O
son O
Jem S-PERSON
. O
So O
Mary S-PERSON
felt O
hopeless O
of O
obtaining O
any O
intelligence O
of O
the O
sailor's O
arrangements O
from O
her O
. O
Then O
, O
should O
she O
apply O
to O
Jem S-PERSON
himself O
? O
No O
! O
she O
knew O
him O
too O
well O
. O
She O
felt O
how O
thoroughly O
he O
must O
ere O
now O
have O
had O
it O
in O
his O
power O
to O
exculpate O
himself O
at O
another's O
expense O
. O
And O
his O
tacit O
refusal O
so O
to O
do O
had O
assured O
her O
of O
what O
she O
had O
never O
doubted O
, O
that O
the O
murderer O
was O
safe O
from O
any O
impeachment O
of O
his O
. O
But O
then O
neither O
would O
he O
consent O
, O
she O
feared O
, O
to O
any O
steps O
which O
might O
tend O
to O
prove O
himself O
innocent O
. O
At O
any O
rate O
, O
she O
could O
not O
consult O
him O
. O
He O
was O
removed O
to O
Kirkdale S-GPE
, O
and O
time O
pressed O
. O
Already O
it O
was O
Saturday S-DATE
at O
noon S-TIME
. O
And O
even O
if O
she O
could O
have O
gone O
to O
him O
, O
I O
believe O
she O
would O
not O
. O
She O
longed O
to O
do O
all O
herself O
| | O
to O
be O
his O
liberator O
, O
his O
deliverer O
| | O
to O
win O
him O
life O
, O
though O
she O
might O
never O
regain O
his O
lost O
love O
, O
by O
her O
own O
exertions O
. O
And O
oh O
! O
how O
could O
she O
see O
him O
to O
discuss O
a O
subject O
in O
which O
both O
knew O
who O
was O
the O
blood O
- O
stained O
man O
| | O
and O
yet O
whose O
name O
might O
not O
be O
breathed O
by O
either O
, O
so O
dearly O
with O
all O
his O
faults O
, O
his O
sins O
, O
was O
he O
loved O
by O
both O
. O
All O
at O
once O
, O
when O
she O
had O
ceased O
to O
try O
and O
remember O
, O
the O
name O
of O
Will's S-PRODUCT
ship O
flashed O
across O
her O
mind O
. O
The B-PERSON
John I-PERSON
Cropper E-PERSON
. O
He O
had O
named O
it O
, O
she O
had O
been O
sure O
, O
all O
along O
. O
He O
had O
named O
it O
in O
his O
conversation O
with O
her O
that O
last O
, O
that O
fatal O
Thursday S-DATE
evening O
. O
She O
repeated O
it O
over O
and O
over O
again O
, O
through O
a O
nervous O
dread O
of O
again O
forgetting O
it O
. O
The B-PERSON
John I-PERSON
Cropper E-PERSON
. O
And O
then O
, O
as O
if O
she O
were O
rousing O
herself O
out O
of O
some O
strange O
stupor O
, O
she O
bethought O
her O
of O
Margaret S-PERSON
. O
Who O
so O
likely O
as O
Margaret S-PERSON
to O
treasure O
every O
little O
particular O
respecting O
Will S-PERSON
, O
now O
Alice S-PERSON
was O
dead O
to O
all O
the O
stirring O
purposes O
of O
life O
? O
She O
had O
gone O
thus O
far O
in O
her O
process O
of O
thought O
, O
when O
a O
neighbour O
stepped O
in O
| | O
she O
with O
whom O
they O
had O
usually O
deposited O
the O
house O
- O
key O
, O
when O
both O
Mary S-PERSON
and O
her O
father O
were O
absent O
from O
home O
, O
and O
who O
consequently O
took O
upon O
herself O
to O
answer O
all O
inquiries O
, O
and O
receive O
all O
messages O
which O
any O
friends O
might O
make O
, O
or O
leave O
, O
on O
finding O
the O
house O
shut O
up O
. O
" O
Here's O
somewhat O
for O
you O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
! O
A O
policeman O
left O
it O
. O
" O
A O
bit O
of O
parchment O
. O
Many O
people O
have O
a O
dread O
of O
those O
mysterious O
pieces O
of O
parchment O
. O
I O
am O
one O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
was O
another O
. O
Her O
heart O
misgave O
her O
as O
she O
took O
it O
, O
and O
looked O
at O
the O
unusual O
appearance O
of O
the O
writing O
, O
which O
, O
though O
legible O
enough O
, O
conveyed O
no O
idea O
to O
her O
, O
or O
rather O
her O
mind O
shut O
itself O
up O
against O
receiving O
any O
idea O
, O
which O
after O
all O
was O
rather O
a O
proof O
she O
had O
some O
suspicion O
of O
the O
meaning O
that O
awaited O
her O
. O
" O
What O
is O
it O
? O
" O
asked O
she O
, O
in O
a O
voice O
from O
which O
all O
the O
pith O
and O
marrow O
of O
strength O
seemed O
extracted O
. O
" O
Nay O
! O
how O
should O
I O
know O
? O
Policeman O
said O
he'd O
call O
again O
towards O
evening O
, O
and O
see O
if O
you'd O
getten O
it O
. O
He O
were O
loth O
to O
leave O
it O
, O
though O
I O
telled O
him O
who O
I O
was O
, O
and O
all O
about O
my O
keeping O
th' O
key O
, O
and O
taking O
messages O
. O
" O
" O
What O
is O
it O
about O
? O
" O
asked O
Mary S-PERSON
again O
, O
in O
the O
same O
hoarse O
, O
feeble O
voice O
, O
and O
turning O
it O
over O
in O
her O
fingers O
, O
as O
if O
she O
dreaded O
to O
inform O
herself O
of O
its O
meaning O
. O
" O
Well O
! O
yo O
can O
read O
word O
of O
writing O
and O
I O
cannot O
, O
so O
it's O
queer O
I O
should O
have O
to O
tell O
you O
. O
But O
my O
master O
says O
it's O
a O
summons O
for O
yo O
to O
bear O
witness O
again O
Jem B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
, O
at O
th' O
trial O
at O
Liverpool B-FAC
Assize E-FAC
. O
" O
" O
God O
pity O
me O
! O
" O
said O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
faintly O
, O
as O
white O
as O
a O
sheet O
. O
" O
Nay S-PERSON
, O
wench O
, O
never O
take O
on O
so O
. O
What O
yo O
can O
say O
will O
go O
little O
way O
either O
to O
help O
or O
to O
hinder O
, O
for O
folk O
say O
he's O
certain O
to O
be O
hung O
| | O
and O
sure O
enough O
it O
was O
t'other O
one O
as O
was O
your O
sweetheart O
. O
" O
But O
Mary S-PERSON
was O
beyond O
any O
pang O
this O
speech O
would O
have O
given O
at O
another O
time O
. O
Her O
thoughts O
were O
all O
busy O
picturing O
to O
herself O
the O
terrible O
occasion O
of O
their O
next O
meeting O
— O
not O
as O
lovers O
meet O
should O
they O
meet O
! O
" O
Well O
! O
" O
said O
the O
neighbour O
, O
seeing O
no O
use O
in O
remaining O
with O
one O
who O
noticed O
her O
words O
or O
her O
presence O
so O
little O
| | O
" O
thou'lt O
tell O
policeman O
thou'st O
getten O
his O
precious O
bit O
of O
paper O
. O
He O
seemed O
to O
think O
I O
should O
be O
keeping O
it O
for O
mysel O
| | O
he's O
th' O
first S-ORDINAL
as O
has O
ever O
misdoubted O
me O
about O
giving O
messages O
, O
or O
notes O
. O
Good O
day O
. O
" O
She O
left O
the O
house O
, O
but O
Mary S-PERSON
did O
not O
know O
it O
. O
She O
sat O
still O
with O
the O
parchment O
in O
her O
hand O
. O
All O
at O
once O
she O
started O
up O
. O
She O
would O
take O
it O
to O
Job B-PERSON
Legh E-PERSON
and O
ask O
him O
to O
tell O
her O
the O
true O
meaning O
, O
for O
it O
could O
not O
be O
that O
. O
So O
she O
went O
, O
and O
choked O
out O
her O
words O
of O
inquiry O
. O
" O
It's O
a O
sub O
- O
pœna O
, O
" O
he O
replied O
, O
turning O
the O
parchment O
over O
with O
the O
air O
of O
a O
connoisseur O
| | O
for O
Job O
loved O
hard O
words O
, O
and O
lawyer O
- O
like O
forms O
, O
and O
even O
esteemed O
himself O
slightly O
qualified O
for O
a O
lawyer O
, O
from O
the O
smattering O
of O
knowledge O
he O
had O
picked O
up O
from O
an O
odd O
volume O
of O
Blackstone S-ORG
that O
he O
had O
once O
purchased O
at O
a O
book O
- O
stall O
. O
" O
A O
sub O

pœna O
— O
what O
is O
that O
? O
" O
gasped O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
still O
in O
suspense O
. O
Job O
was O
struck O
with O
her O
voice O
, O
her O
changed O
, O
miserable O
voice O
, O
and O
peered O
at O
her O
countenance O
from O
over O
his O
spectacles O
. O
" O

" O
Nothing O

echoed O

in O
such O

different O
tone O

confidence O

which O
was O
beginning O

unlock O
the O
sympathy O

Job O

Mary S-PERSON
knew O
herself O
to O
blame O

her O
errors O

her O
that O
morning O

" O
Here's B-PERSON
Mary E-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
Job S-PERSON

almost O

" O
It O
was O
calling O
out O
the O

of O

so O
strong O

warm O
in O
most O
of O
those O
who O

offer O

whose O
heart O
goes O
eagerly O

kindly O
with O
that O
little O
. O
Margaret S-PERSON
came O
towards O
Mary S-PERSON
with O
a O
welcoming O
gesture O
, O
and O
a O
kinder O
manner O
by O
far O
than O
she O
had O
used O
in O
the O
morning O

, O
thou O
know'st O

urged O
Job S-PERSON

And O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
faint O
and O
weary O
, O
and O
with O
a O
heart O
too O
aching O
- O
full O
of O
other O
matters O
to O
be O
pertinacious O
in O
this O
, O
withdrew O
her O
refusal O
. O
They O
ate O
their O
dinner O
quietly O

for O
to O
all O
it O
was O
an O
effort O
to O
speak O
, O
and O
after O
one S-CARDINAL
or O
two S-CARDINAL
attempts O
they O
had O
subsided O
into O
silence O
. O
When O
the O
meal O
was O
ended O
Job O
began O
again O
on O
the O
subject O
they O
all O
had O
at O
heart O
. O
" O
Yon O
poor O
lad O
at O
Kirkdale S-GPE
will O
want O
a O
lawyer O
to O
see O
they O
don't O
put O
on O
him O
, O
but O
do O
him O
justice O
. O
Hast O
thought O
of O
that O
? O
" O
Mary S-PERSON
had O
not O
, O
and O
felt O
sure O
his O
mother O
had O
not O
. O
Margaret S-PERSON
confirmed O
this O
last O
supposition O
. O
" O
I've O
but O
just O
been O
there O
, O
and O
poor O
Jane S-PERSON
is O
like O
one O
dateless O
| | O
so O
many O
griefs O
come O
on O
her O
at O
once O
. O
One S-CARDINAL
time O
she O
seems O
to O
make O
sure O
he'll O
be O
hung O

and O
if O
I O
took O
her O
in O
that O
way O
, O
she O
flew O
out O
( O
poor O
body O
! O
) O
and O
said O
, O
that O
in O
spite O
of O
what O
folk O
said O
, O
there O
were O
them O
as O
could O
, O
and O
would O
prove O
him O
guiltless O
. O
So O
I O
never O
knew O
where O
to O
have O
her O
. O
The O
only O
thing O
she O
was O
constant O
in O
, O
was O
declaring O
him O
innocent O
. O
" O
" O
Mother O
- O
like O
! O
" O
said O
Job S-PERSON
. O
" O
She O
meant O
Will O
, O
when O
she O
spoke O
of O
them O
that O
could O
prove O
him O
innocent O
. O
He O
was O
with O
Will S-PERSON
on O
Thursday B-TIME
night E-TIME
, O
walking O
a O
part O
of O
the O
way O
with O
him O
to O
Liverpool S-GPE
| | O
now O
the O
thing O
is O
to O
lay O
hold O
on O
Will O
and O
get O
him O
to O
prove O
this O
. O
" O
So O
spoke O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
calm O
, O
from O
the O
earnestness O
of O
her O
purpose O
. O
" O
Don't O
build O
too O
much O
on O
it O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
" O
said O
Job S-PERSON
. O
" O
I O
do O
build O
on O
it O
, O
" O
replied O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
" O
because O
I O
know O
it's O
the O
truth O
, O
and O
I O
mean O
to O
try O
and O
prove O
it O
, O
come O
what O
may O
. O
Nothing O
you O
can O
say O
will O
daunt O
me O
, O
Job O

so O
don't O
you O
go O
and O
try O
. O
You O
may O
help O
, O
but O
you O
cannot O
hinder O
me O
doing O
what O
I'm O
resolved O
on O
. O
" O
They O
respected O
her O
firmness O
of O
determination O
, O
and O
Job S-PERSON
almost O
gave O
in O
to O
her O
belief O
, O
when O
he O
saw O
how O
steadfastly O
she O
was O
acting O
upon O
it O
. O
Oh O
! O
surest O
way O
of O
conversion O
to O
our O
faith O
, O
whatever O
it O
may O
be O
, O
— O
regarding O
either O
small O
things O
, O
or O
great O
, O
— O
when O
it O
is O
beheld O
as O
the O
actuating O
principle O

from O
which O
we O
never O
swerve O

When O
it O
is O

that O

instead O

over O

much O
profession O
, O
it O
is O
worked O
into O
the O
life O
, O
and O
moves O
every O
action O
! O
Mary S-PERSON
gained O
courage O
as O
she O
instinctively O
felt O
she O
had O
made O
way O
with O
one O
at O
least O
of O
her O
companions O
. O
" O
Now O
I'm O
clear O
about O
this O
much O
, O
" O
she O
continued O
, O
" O

sure O

I'll O
just O
take O
my O

him O

" O
No O

done O

Margaret S-PERSON

Mary S-PERSON
were O
left O
alone O
. O
And O
this O
seemed O
to O
bring O
back O
the O
feeling O
of O
awkwardness O
, O
not O
to O
say O
estrangement O
. O
But O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
excited O
to O
an O
unusual O
pitch O
of O
courage O
, O
was O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
to O
break O
silence O
. O
" O
Oh O
, O
Margaret S-PERSON
! O
" O
said O
she O
, O
" O
I O
see O

her O

came O
choking O
up O
her O
voice O

you O
have O
a O
right O

judge O

it O

only O
in O
your O
judgment O
remember O
mercy O

the O
Bible S-WORK_OF_ART
says O
. O
You O
, O
who O
have O
been O
always O
good O

cannot O
tell O
how O
easy O
it O
is O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
to O
go O
a O
little O
wrong O
, O

then O
how O
hard O
it O
is O
to O
go O
back O
. O
Oh O
! O
I O
little O
thought O
when O
I O
was O
first S-ORDINAL
pleased O
with O
Mr. O
Carson's S-PERSON
speeches O
, O
how O
it O
would O
all O
end O

perhaps O
in O
the O
death O
of O
him O

love O
better O
than O
life O

" O
She O
burst O
into O
a O
passion O
of O
tears O
. O
The O
feelings O
pent O
up O
through O
the O
day O
would O
have O
vent O

checking O
herself O
with O
a O
strong O
effort O
, O
and O
looking O
up O
at O
Margaret S-PERSON
as O
piteously O
as O
if O
those O
calm O
, O
stony O
eyes O
could O
see O
her O
imploring O
face O

she O
added O
, O
" O
I O
must O
not O

am O
very O

very O
wretched O

her O
voice O

tones O
of O
misery O

humility O

would O
refuse O
the O
kindness O
for O

she O
begged O
so O
penitently O
? O
Not O
Margaret S-PERSON

The O
old O
friendly O
manner O

back O

how O
much O
there O
is O
against O

produced O
out O

Bless O
you O

don't O

such O
ado O
about O

Margaret S-PERSON
, O
cutting O
short O
Mary's S-PERSON
thanks O
. O
" O
I O
sometimes O
think O
there's O
two S-CARDINAL
sides O
to O
the O
commandment O

and O
that O
we O
may O
say O
, O
' O
Let O
others O
do O
unto O
you O
, O
as O
you O
would O
do O
unto O
them O

for O
pride O
often O
prevents O
our O
giving O
others O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
pleasure O
, O
in O
not O
letting O
them O
be O
kind O

when O
their O
hearts O
are O
longing O

we O
ourselves O

just O
the O

if O
we O
were O
in O
their O
place O

Oh O
! O
how O
often O
I've O
been O
hurt O
, O
by O
being O
coldly O
told O
by O
persons O
not O
to O
trouble O
myself O
about O
their O
care O
, O
or O
sorrow O

when O
I O
saw O
them O
in O
great O
grief O
, O
and O
wanted O
to O
be O
of O
comfort O

Our O
Lord O
Jesus S-PERSON
was O
not O
above O
letting O
folk O
minister O
to O
Him O
, O
for O
He O
knew O
how O
happy O
it O
makes O
one O

do O
aught O

It's O
the O
happiest O
work O
on O
earth O

" O
Mary S-PERSON
had O
been O
too O
much O
engrossed O
by O
watching O
what O
was O
passing O
in O
the O
street O
to O
attend O
very O
closely O
to O
that O
which O
Margaret S-PERSON
was O
saying O
. O
From O
her O
seat O
she O
could O
see O
out O
of O
the O
window O
pretty O
plainly O
, O
and O
she O
caught O
sight O
of O
a O
gentleman O
walking O
alongside O
of O
Job O
, O
evidently O
in O
earnest O
conversation O
with O
him O
, O
and O
looking O
keen O
and O
penetrating O
enough O
to O
be O
a O
lawyer O
. O
Job O
was O
laying O
down O
something O
to O
be O
attended O
to O
she O
could O
see O
, O
by O
his O
up O
- O
lifted O
fore O
- O
finger O
, O
and O
his O
whole O
gesture O
| | O
then O
he O
pointed O
and O
nodded O
across O
the O
street O
to O
his O
own O
house O
, O
as O
if O
inducing O
his O
companion O
to O
come O
in O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
dreaded O
lest O
he O
should O
, O
and O
she O
be O
subjected O
to O
a O
closer O
cross-examination O
than O
she O
had O
hitherto O
undergone O
, O
as O
to O
why O
she O
was O
so O
certain O
that O
Jem S-PERSON
was O
innocent O
. O
She O
feared O
he O
was O
coming O
| | O
he O
stepped O
a O
little O
towards O
the O
spot O
. O
No O
! O
it O
was O
only O
to O
make O
way O
for O
a O
child O
, O
tottering O
along O
, O
whom O
Mary S-PERSON
had O
overlooked O
. O
Now O
Job O
took O
him O
by O
the O
button O
, O
so O
earnestly O
familiar O
had O
he O
grown O
. O
The O
gentleman O
looked O
" O
fidging O
fain O
" O
to O
be O
gone O
, O
but O
submitted O
in O
a O
manner O
that O
made O
Mary S-PERSON
like O
him O
in O
spite O
of O
his O
profession O
. O
Then O
came O
a O
volley O
of O
last O
words O
, O
answered O
by O
briefest O
nods O
, O
and O
monosyllables O

and O
then O
the O
stranger O
went O
off O
with O
redoubled O
quickness O
of O
pace O
, O
and O
Job S-PERSON
crossed O
the O
street O
with O
a O
little O
satisfied O
air O
of O
importance O
on O
his O
kindly O
face O
. O
" O
Well O
! O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
he O
on O
entering O

" O

could O
not O
be O
patient O
in O
her O
loneliness O

so O
much O
painful O
thought O
weighed O
on O
her O
mind O

the O
very O
house O
was O
haunted O
with O
memories O

performed O
all O

far O
as O
her O

powers O

of O
any O

unconsciously O
sought O
after O
some O
course O
of O
action O
in O
which O
she O
might O
engage O
. O
Any O
thing O
, O
any O
thing O
, O
rather O
than O
leisure O
for O
reflection O
. O
And O
then O
came O
up O
the O
old O
feeling O
which O
first S-ORDINAL
bound O
Ruth S-PERSON

Naomi S-PERSON

the O
love O

both O
held O
towards O
one S-CARDINAL

Mary S-PERSON
felt O
that O
her O
cares O
would O
be O
most O
lightened O
by O
being O
of O
use O
, O
or O
of O
comfort O
to O
his O
mother O

So O
she O
once O
more O
locked O
up O
the O
house O
, O

set O
off O
towards O
Ancoats S-PERSON

along O

down O

for O
fear O

should O
recognise O
her O

arrest O
her O
progress O
. O
Jane B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
sat O
quietly O
in O
her O
chair O
as O
Mary S-PERSON
entered O
| | O
so O
quietly O
, O
as O
to O
strike O
one O
by O
the O
contrast O
it O
presented O
to O
her O
usual O
bustling O
and O
nervous O
manner O
. O
She O
looked O
very O
pale O
and O
wan O
| | O
but O
the O
quietness O
was O
the O
thing O
that O
struck O
Mary S-PERSON
most O
. O
She O
did O
not O
rise O
as O
Mary S-PERSON
came O
in O
, O
but O
sat O
still O
and O
said O
something O
in O
so O
gentle O
, O
so O
feeble O
a O
voice O
, O
that O
Mary S-PERSON
did O
not O
catch O
it O
. O
Mrs. O
Davenport S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
there O
, O
plucked O
Mary S-PERSON
by O
the O
gown O
, O
and O
whispered O
, O
" O
Never O

her O

worn O
out O

tell O
you O
all O
about O
it O
, O
up O
- O
stairs O
. O
" O
But O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
touched O
by O
the O
anxious O
look O
with O
which O
Mrs. O
Wilson S-PERSON
gazed O
at O
her O
, O
as O
if O
awaiting O
the O
answer O
to O
some O
question O
, O
went O
forward O
to O
listen O
to O
the O
speech O
she O
was O
again O
repeating O
. O
" O
What O
is O
this O
? O
will O
you O
tell O
me O
? O
" O
Then O
Mary S-PERSON
looked O
and O
saw O
another O
ominous O
slip O
of O
parchment O
in O
the O
mother's O
hand O
, O
which O
she O
was O
rolling O
up O
and O
down O
in O
a O
tremulous O
manner O
between O
her O
fingers O
. O
Mary's S-PERSON
heart O
sickened O
within O
her O
, O
and O
she O
could O
not O
speak O
. O
" O
What O
is O
it O
? O
" O
she O
repeated O
. O
" O
Will O
you O
tell O

" O
She O
still O
looked O
at O
Mary S-PERSON

with O
the O

child O
- O
like O
gaze O
of O
wonder O
and O
patient O
entreaty O
. O
What O
could O
she O
answer O
? O
" O
I O
telled O
ye O
not O
to O
heed O
her O
, O

said O
Mrs. O

a O

angrily O

went O
on O
with O
her O
soothing O
caresses O
. O
" O
She O
has O
had O
no O
sleep O
for O
many O
nights O
, O
" O
said O
the O
girl O
to O
Mrs. O
Davenport S-PERSON
, O
" O
and O
all O
this O
woe O
and O
sorrow O
, O
— O
it's O
no O
wonder O
. O
" O
" O
No O
, O
indeed O
! O
" O
Mrs. O
Davenport S-PERSON
answered O
. O
" O
We O
must O
get O
her O
fairly O
to O
bed O
| | O
we O
must O
get O
her O
undressed O
, O
and O
all O
| | O
and O
trust O
to O
God O
, O
in O
His O
mercy O
, O
to O
send O
her O
to O
sleep O
, O
or O
else O
, O
— O
" O
For O
, O
you O
see O
, O
they O
spoke O
before O
her O
as O
if O
she O
were O
not O
there O
| | O
her O
heart O
was O
so O
far O
away O
. O
Accordingly O
they O
almost O
lifted O
her O
from O
the O
chair O
in O
which O
she O
sat O
motionless O
, O
and O
taking O
her O
up O
as O
gently O
as O
a O
mother O
carries O
her O
sleeping O
baby O
, O
they O
undressed O
her O
poor O
, O
worn O
form O
, O
and O
laid O
her O
in O
the O
little O
bed O
up O
- O
stairs O
. O
They O
had O
once O
thought O
of O
placing O
her O
in O
Jem's O
bed O
, O
to O
be O
out O
of O
sight O
or O
sound O
of O
any O
disturbance O
of O
Alice's S-PERSON
, O
but O
then O
again O
they O
remembered O
the O
shock O
she O
might O
receive O
in O
awakening O
in O
so O
unusual O
a O
place O
, O
and O
also O
that O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
who O
intended O
to O
keep O
vigil O
that B-TIME
night E-TIME
in O
the O
house O
of O
mourning O
, O
would O
find O
it O
difficult O
to O
divide O
her O
attention O
in O
the O
possible O
cases O
that O
might O
ensue O
. O
So O
they O
laid O
her O
, O
as O
I O
said O
before O
, O
on O
that O
little O
pallet O
- O
bed O
| | O
and O
, O
as O
they O
were O
slowly O
withdrawing O
from O
the O
bed O
- O
side O
, O
hoping O
and O
praying O
that O
she O
might O
sleep O
, O
and O
forget O
for O
a O
time O
her O
heavy O
burden O
, O
she O
looked O
wistfully O
after O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
and O
whispered O
, O
" O
You O
haven't O
told O
me O
what O
it O
is O
. O
What O
is O
it O
? O
" O
And O
gazing O
in O
her O
face O
for O
the O
expected O
answer O
, O
her O
eye O
- O
lids O
slowly O
closed O
, O
and O
she O
fell O
into O
a O
deep O
, O
heavy O
sleep O
, O
almost O
as O
profound O
a O
rest O
as O
death O
. O
Mrs. O
Davenport S-PERSON
went O
her O
way O
, O
and O
Mary S-PERSON
was O
alone O
, O
— O
for O
I O
cannot O
call O
those O
who O
sleep O
allies O
against O
the O
agony O
of O
thought O
which O
solitude O
sometimes O
brings O
up O
. O
She O
dreaded O
the O
night O
before O
her O
. O
Alice S-PERSON
might O
die O
| | O
the O
doctor O
had O
that O
day O
declared O
her O
case O
hopeless O
, O
and O
not O
far O
from O
death O
| | O
and O
at O
times O
the O
terror O
, O
so O
natural O
to O
the O
young O
, O
not O
of O
death O
, O
but O
of O
the O
remains O
of O
the O
dead O
, O
came O
over O
Mary S-PERSON
| | O
and O
she O
bent O
and O
listened O
anxiously O
for O
the O
long O
- O
drawn O
, O
pausing O
breath O
of O
the O
sleeping O
Alice S-PERSON
. O
Or O
Mrs. O
Wilson S-PERSON
might O
awake O
in O
a O
state O
which O
Mary S-PERSON
dreaded O
to O
anticipate O
, O
and O
anticipated O
while O
she O
dreaded O
| | O
— O
in O
a O
state O
of O
complete O
delirium O
. O
Already O
her O
senses O
had O
been O
severely O
stunned O
by O
the O
full O
explanation O
of O
what O
was O
required O
of O
her O
, O
— O
of O
what O
she O
had O
to O
prove O
against O
her O
son O
, O
her O
Jem S-PERSON
, O
her O
only O
child O
, O
— O
which O
Mary S-PERSON
could O
not O
doubt O
the O
officious O
Mrs. O
Heming S-PERSON
had O
given O
| | O
and O
what O
if O
in O
dreams O
( O
that O
land O
into O
which O
no O
sympathy O
or O
love O
can O
penetrate O
with O
another O
, O
either O
to O
share O
its O
bliss O
or O
its O
agony O
, O
— O
that O
land O
whose O
scenes O
are O
unspeakable O
terrors O
, O
are O
hidden O
mysteries O
, O
are O
priceless O
treasures O
to O
one O
alone O
, O
— O
that O
land O
where O
alone O
I O
may O
see O
, O
while O
yet O
I O
tarry O
here O
, O
the O
sweet O
looks O
of O
my O
dead O
child O
) O
, O
— O
what O
if O
, O
in O
the O
horrors O
of O
her O
dreams O
, O
her O
brain O
should O
go O
still O
more O
astray O
, O
and O
she O
should O
waken O
crazy O
with O
her O
visions O
, O
and O
the O
terrible O
reality O
that O
begot O
them O
? O
How O
much O
worse O
is O
anticipation O
sometimes O
than O
reality O
! O
How O
Mary S-PERSON
dreaded O
that O
night O
, O
and O
how O
calmly O
it O
passed O
by O
! O
Even O
more O
so O
than O
if O
Mary S-PERSON
had O
not O
had O
such O
claims O
upon O
her O
care O
! O
Anxiety O
about O
them O
deadened O
her O
own O
peculiar O
anxieties O
. O
She O
thought O
of O
the O
sleepers O
whom O
she O
was O
watching O
, O
till O
overpowered O
herself O
by O
the O
want O
of O
rest O
, O
she O
fell O
off O
into O
short O
slumbers O
in O
which O
the O
night O
wore O
imperceptibly O
away O
. O
To O
be O
sure O
Alice S-PERSON
spoke O
, O
and O
sang O
, O
during O
her O
waking O
moments O
, O
like O
the O
child O
she O
deemed O
herself O
| | O
but O
so O
happily O
with O
the O
dearly O
- O
loved O
ones O
around O
her O
, O
with O
the O
scent O
of O
the O
heather O
, O
and O
the O
song O
of O
the O
wild O
bird O
hovering O
about O
her O
in O
imagination O
— O
with O
old O
scraps O
of O
ballads O
, O
or O
old O
snatches O
of O
primitive O
versions O
of O
the O
Psalms S-WORK_OF_ART
( O
such O
as O
are O
sung O
in O
country O
churches O
half O
draperied O
over O
with O
ivy O
, O
and O
where O
the O
running O
brook O
, O
or O
the O
murmuring O
wind O
among O
the O
trees O
makes O
fit O
accompaniment O
to O
the O
chorus O
of O
human O
voices O
uttering O
praise O
and O
thanksgiving O
to O
their O
God O
) O
— O
that O
the O
speech O
and O
the O
song O
gave O
comfort O
and O
good O
cheer O
to O
the O
listener's O
heart O
, O
and O
the O
gray O
dawn O
began O
to O
dim O
the O
light O
of O
the O
rush O
- O
candle O
, O
before O
Mary S-PERSON
thought O
it O
possible O
that O
day O
was O
already O
trembling O
on O
the O
horizon O
. O
Then O
she O
got O
up O
from O
the O
chair O
where O
she O
had O
been O
dozing O
, O
and O
went O
, O
half O
- O
asleep O
, O
to O
the O
window O
to O
assure O
herself O
that O
morning O
was O
at O
hand O
. O
The O
streets O
were O
unusually O
quiet O
with O
a O
Sabbath O
stillness O
. O
No O
factory O
bells O
that O
morning O

no O
early O
workmen O
going O
to O
their O
labours O

no O
slip O
- O
shod O
girls O
cleaning O
the O
windows O
of O
the O
little O
shops O
which O
broke O
the O
monotony O
of O
the O
street O
| | O
instead O
, O
you O
might O
see O
here O
and O
there O
some O
operative O
sallying O
forth O
for O
a O
breath O
of O
country O
air O
, O
or O
some O
father O
leading O
out O
his O
wee O
toddling O
bairns O
for O
the O
unwonted O
pleasure O
of O
a O
walk O
with O
" O
Daddy O
, O
" O
in O
the O
clear O
frosty O
morning O
. O
Men O
with O
more O
leisure O
on O
week B-DATE
- I-DATE
days E-DATE
would O
perhaps O
have O
walked O
quicker O
than O
they O
did O
through O
the O
fresh O
sharp O
air O
of O
this O
Sunday S-DATE
morning O
| | O
but O
to O
them O
there O
was O
a O
pleasure O
, O
an O
absolute O
refreshment O
in O
the O
dawdling O
gait O
they O
, O
one O
and O
all O
of O
them O
, O
had O
. O
To O
be O
sure O
, O
there O
were O
one S-CARDINAL
or O
two S-CARDINAL
passengers O
on O
that B-TIME
morning E-TIME
whose O
objects O
were O
less O
innocent O
and O
less O
praiseworthy O
than O
those O
of O
the O
people O
I O
have O
already O
mentioned O
, O
and O
whose O
animal O
state O
of O
mind O
and O
body O
clashed O
jarringly O
on O
the O
peacefulness O
of O
the O
day O
| | O
but O
upon O
them O
I O
will O
not O
dwell O
: O
as O
you O
and O
I O
, O
and O
almost O
every O
one O
, O
I O
think O
, O
may O
send O
up O
our O
individual O
cry O
of O
self O
- O
reproach O
that O
we O
have O
not O
done O
all O
that O
we O
could O
for O
the O
stray O
and O
wandering O
ones O
of O
our O
brethren O
. O
When O
Mary S-PERSON
turned O
from O
the O
window O
, O
she O
went O
to O
the O
bed O
of O
each O
sleeper O
, O
to O
look O
and O
listen O
. O
Alice S-PERSON
looked O
perfectly O
quiet O
and O
happy O
in O
her O
slumber O
, O
and O
her O
face O
seemed O
to O
have O
become O
much O
more O
youthful O
during O
her O
painless O
approach O
to O
death O
. O
Mrs. O
Wilson's S-PERSON
countenance O
was O
stamped O
with O
the O
anxiety O
of O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
few I-DATE
days E-DATE
, O
although O
she O
, O
too O
, O
appeared O
sleeping O
soundly O
| | O
but O
as O
Mary S-PERSON
gazed O
on O
her O
, O
trying O
to O
trace O
a O
likeness O
to O
her O
son O
in O
her O
face O
, O
she O
awoke O
and O
looked O
up O
into O
Mary's S-PERSON
eyes O
, O
while O
the O
expression O
of O
consciousness O
came O
back O
into O
her O
own O
. O
Both O
were O
silent O
for O
a B-TIME
minute E-TIME
or O
two S-CARDINAL
. O
Mary's S-PERSON
eyes O
had O
fallen O
beneath O
that O
penetrating O
gaze O
, O
in O
which O
the O
agony O
of O
memory O
seemed O
every O
moment O
to O
find O
fuller O
vent O
. O
" O
Is O
it O
a O
dream O
? O
" O
the O
mother O
asked O
at O
last O
in O
a O
low O
voice O
. O
" O
No O
! O
" O
replied O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
in O
the O
same O
tone O
. O
Mrs. O
Wilson S-PERSON
hid O
her O
face O
in O
the O
pillow O
. O
She O
was O
fully O
conscious O
of O
every O
thing O
this O
morning O
| | O
it O
was O
evident O
that O
the O
stunning O
effect O
of O
the O
subpœna O
, O
which O
had O
affected O
her O
so O
much O
last O
night O
in O
her O
weak O
, O
worn O
- O
out O
state O
, O
had O
passed O
away O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
offered O
no O
opposition O
when O
she O
indicated O
by O
languid O
gesture O
and O
action O
that O
she O
wished O
to O
rise O
. O
A O
sleepless O
bed O
is O
a O
haunted O
place O
. O
When O
she O
was O
dressed O
with O
Mary's S-PERSON
help O
, O
she O
stood O
by O
Alice S-PERSON
for O
a B-TIME
minute E-TIME
or O
two S-CARDINAL
, O
looking O
at O
the O
slumberer O
. O
" O
How O
happy O
she O
is O
! O
" O
said O
she O
, O
quietly O
and O
sadly O
. O
All O
the O
time O
that O
Mary S-PERSON
was O
getting O
breakfast O
ready O
, O
and O
performing O
every O
other O
little O
domestic O
office O
she O
could O
think O
of O
, O
to O
add O
to O
the O
comfort O
of O
Jem's S-PERSON
mother O
, O
Mrs. O
Wilson S-PERSON
sat O
still O
in O
the O
arm O
- O
chair O
, O
watching O
her O
silently O
. O
Her O
old O
irritation O
of O
temper O
and O
manner O
seemed O
to O
have O
suddenly O
disappeared O
, O
or O
perhaps O
she O
was O
too O
depressed O
in O
body O
and O
mind O
to O
show O
it O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
told O
her O
all O
that O
had O
been O
done O
with O
regard O
to O
Mr. O
Bridgenorth S-PERSON
| | O
all O
her O
own O
plans O
for O
seeking O
out O
Will O
| | O
all O
her O
hopes O
| | O
and O
concealed O
as O
well O
as O
she O
could O
all O
the O
doubts O
and O
fears O
that O
would O
arise O
unbidden O
. O
To O
this O
Mrs. O
Wilson S-PERSON
listened O
without O
much O
remark O
, O
but O
with O
deep O
interest O
and O
perfect O
comprehension O
. O
When O
Mary S-PERSON
ceased O
she O
sighed O
and O
said O
, O
" O
Oh O
wench O
! O
I O
am O
his O
mother O
, O
and O
yet O
I O
do O
so O
little O
, O
I O
can O
do O
so O
little O
! O
That's O
what O
frets O
me O
! O
I O
seem O

child O

sees O
its O
mammy O
ill O

moans O
and O
cries O
its O
little O
heart O
out O
, O
yet O
does O
nought O
to O
help O
. O
I O
think O
my O
sense O
has O
left O
me O
all O
at O
once O
, O
and O
I O
can't O
even O
find O
strength O
to O
cry O
like O
the O
little O
child O
. O
" O
Hereupon O
she O
broke O
into O
a O
feeble O
wail O
of O
self O
- O
reproach O
, O
that O
her O
outward O
show O
of O
misery O
was O
not O
greater O

as O
if O
any O
cries O
, O
or O
tears O
, O
or O
loud O
- O
spoken O
words O
could O
have O
told O
of O
such O
pangs O
at O
the O
heart O
as O
that O
look O
, O
and O
that O
thin O
, O
piping O
, O
altered O
voice O
! O
But O
think O
of O
Mary S-PERSON
and O
what O
she O
was O
enduring O
! O
Picture O
to O
yourself O
( O
for O
I O
cannot O
tell O
you O
) O
the O
armies O
of O
thoughts O
that O
met O
and O
clashed O
in O
her O
brain O
| | O
and O
then O
imagine O
the O
effort O
it O
cost O
her O
to O
be O
calm O
, O
and O
quiet O
, O
and O
even O
, O
in O
a O
faint O
way O
, O
cheerful O
and O
smiling O
at O
times O
. O
After O
a O
while O
she O
began O
to O
stir O
about O
in O
her O
own O
mind O
for O
some O
means O
of O
sparing O
the O
poor O
mother O
the O
trial O
of O
appearing O
as O
a O
witness O
in O
the O
matter O
of O
the O
gun O
. O
She O
had O
made O
no O
allusion O
to O
her O
summons O
this B-TIME
morning E-TIME
, O
and O
Mary S-PERSON
almost O
thought O
she O
must O
have O
forgotten O
it O
| | O
and O
surely O
some O
means O
might O
be O
found O
to O
prevent O
that O
additional O
sorrow O
. O
She O
must O
see O
Job O
about O
it O
| | O
nay O
, O
if O
necessary O
, O
she O
must O
see O
Mr. O
Bridgenorth S-PERSON
, O
with O
all O
his O
truth O
- O
compelling O
powers O
| | O
for O
, O
indeed O
, O
she O
had O
so O
struggled O
and O
triumphed O
( O
though O
a O
sadly O
- O
bleeding O
victor O
at O
heart O
) O
over O
herself O
these O
two S-CARDINAL
last O
days O
, O
had O
so O
concealed O
agony O
, O
and O
hidden O
her O
inward O
woe O
and O
bewilderment O
, O
that O
she O
began O
to O
take O
confidence O
, O
and O
to O
have O
faith O
in O
her O
own O
powers O
of O
meeting O
any O
one O
with O
a O
passably O
fair O
show O
, O
whatever O
might O
be O
rending O
her O
life O
beneath O
the O
cloak O
of O
her O
deception O
. O
Accordingly O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
Mrs. O
Davenport S-PERSON
came O
in O
after O
morning S-TIME
church O
, O
to O
ask O
after O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
lone O
women O
, O
and O
she O
had O
heard O
the O
report O
Mary S-PERSON
had O
to O
give O
( O
so O
much O
better O
as O
regarded O
Mrs. O
Wilson S-PERSON
than O
what O
they O
had O
feared O
the O
night O
before O
it O
would O
have O
been O
) O
— O
as O
soon O
as O
this O
kind O
- O
hearted O
, O
grateful O
woman O
came O
in O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
telling O
her O
her O
purpose O
, O
went O
off O
to O
fetch O
the O
doctor O
who O
attended O
Alice S-PERSON
. O
He O
was O
shaking O
himself O
after O
his O
morning's O
round O
, O
and O
happy O
in O
the O
anticipation O
of O
his O
Sunday's O
dinner O
| | O
but O
he O
was O
a O
good O
- O
tempered O
man O
, O
who O
found O
it O
difficult O
to O
keep O
down O
his O
jovial O
easiness O
even O
by O
the O
bed O
of O
sickness O
or O
death O
. O
He O
had O
mischosen O
his O
profession O
| | O
for O
it O
was O
his O
delight O
to O
see O
every O
one O
around O
him O
in O
full O
enjoyment O
of O
life O
. O
However O
, O
he O
subdued O
his O
face O
to O
the O
proper O
expression O
of O
sympathy O
, O
befitting O
a O
doctor O
listening O
to O
a O
patient O
, O
or O
a O
patient's O
friend O
( O
and O
Mary's S-PERSON
sad O
, O
pale O
, O
anxious O
face O
might O
be O
taken O
for O
either O
the O
one O
or O
the O
other O
) O
. O
" O
Well O
, O
my O
girl O
! O
and O
what O
brings O
you O
here O
? O
" O
said O
he O
, O
as O
he O
entered O
his O
surgery O
. O
" O
Not O
on O
your O
own O
account O
, O
I O
hope O
. O
" O
" O
I O
wanted O
you O
to O
come O
and O
see O
Alice B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
, O
— O
and O
then O
I O
thought O
you O
would O
may O
be O
take O
a O
look O
at O
Mrs. O
Wilson S-PERSON
. O
" O
He O
bustled O
on O
his O
hat O
and O
coat O
, O
and O
followed O
Mary S-PERSON
instantly O
. O
After O
shaking O
his O
head O
over O
Alice S-PERSON
( O
as O
if O
it O
was O
a O
mournful O
thing O
for O
one O
so O
pure O
and O
good O
, O
so O
true O
, O
although O
so O
humble O
a O
Christian S-NORP
, O
to O
be O
nearing O
her O

) O
, O
and O
muttering O
the O
accustomed O
words O
intended O
to O
destroy O
hope O
, O
and O
prepare O
anticipation O
, O
he O
went O
in O
compliance O
with O
Mary's S-PERSON
look O
to O
ask O
the O
usual O
questions O
of O
Mrs. O
Wilson S-PERSON
, O
who O
sat O
passively O
in O
her O
arm O
- O
chair O
. O
She O
answered O
his O
questions O
, O
and O
submitted O
to O
his O
examination O
. O
" O
How O
do O
you O
think O
her O
? O
" O
asked O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
eagerly O
. O
" O
Why O
— O
a O
, O
" O
began O
he O
, O
perceiving O
that O
he O
was O
desired O
to O
take O
one S-CARDINAL
side O
in O
his O
answer O
, O
and O
unable O
to O
find O
out O
whether O
his O
listener O
was O
anxious O
for O
a O
favourable O
verdict O
or O
otherwise O

but O
thinking O
it O
most O
probable O
that O
she O
would O
desire O
the O
former O

he O
continued O
, O
" O

natural O
result O

such O
a O
shock O

murdered O

indignantly O

only O
taken O
up O
on O
suspicion O

still O
in O
the O
anxious O
tone O

he O

journey O

Ib O

Mary S-PERSON
went O
home O

Oh O
! O
how O
her O
head O
did O
ache O
, O
and O
how O
dizzy O
her O
brain O
was O
growing O
! O

there O
would O
be O
time O
enough O
she O
felt O
for O
giving O
way O
, O
hereafter O

So O
she O
sat O
quiet O
and O
still O
by O
an O
effort O

sitting O
near O
the O
window O
, O
and O
looking O
out O
of O
it O
, O
but O
seeing O
nothing O
, O
when O
all O
at O
once O
she O
caught O
sight O
of O
something O
which O
roused O
her O
up O
, O
and O
made O
her O
draw O
back O
. O

it O
was O
too O
late O

had O
been O
seen O

Sally B-PERSON

flaunted O
into O
the O
little O
dingy O
room O

making O
it O
gaudy O
with O
the O
Sunday S-DATE
excess O
of O
colouring O
in O
her O
dress O
. O
She O
was O
really O
curious O
to O
see O
Mary S-PERSON
| | O
her O
connexion O
with O
a O
murderer O
seemed O
to O
have O
made O
her O
into O
a O
sort O
of O
lusus O

and O
was O
almost O
, O
by O
some O
, O
expected O
to O
have O
made O
a O
change O
in O
her O

earnestly O
did O
they O
stare O
at O

been O

much O
absorbed O

notice O

Now O
Sally S-PERSON
had O
a O
grand O
view O
, O

looked O
her O
over O

over O
( O
a O
very O
different O
thing O
from O
looking O
her O
through O
and O
through O
) O
, O

almost O
learnt O
her O
off O

heart O

a O
little O

up O

too O

between O

a O

of O
a O
gossip O

will O
like O
hearing O
all O
how O

about O
the O
trial O

well O
enough O

you O
off O

Betsy B-PERSON

was O
saying O
yesterday S-DATE

she O
shouldn't O
wonder O

you'd O
prove O
quite O
an O
attraction O

customers O

a O
one O
would O
come O

have O
their O
gowns O
made O
by O

to O
catch O
a O
glimpse O

, O
Mary S-PERSON

you'll O
turn O
out O

heroine O

little O
fingers O
twitched O
worse O

large O
soft O
eyes O
looked O
up O
pleadingly O
into O
Sally's S-PERSON

she O
went O
on O
in O
the O

strain O

not O
from O
any O
unkind O
or O
cruel O
feeling O
towards O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
but O
solely O
because O
she O
was O
incapable O

She O
had O
been O
shocked O

of O
course O

at O
Mr. O

at O
the O

time O
the O
excitement O
was O
rather O
pleasant O

otherwise O

dearly O
now O
would O
she O
have O
enjoyed O
the O

sure O

! O
take O
my O
advice O

sure O

good O

sense O

a O
little O
bit O

what O
in O

Mary S-PERSON

firing O
up O
from O
the O
state O
of O
languid O
indifference O

which O
she O
had O
sunk O

settling O
about O

you O
think O

What O
grieves O

too O
fast O

so O
curious O

so O
unscrupulous O

she O
remembered O
how O

she O
herself O

at O
first S-ORDINAL

believed O
him O
guilty O

cast O
stones O
at O
those O
who O
, O
on O
similar O
evidence O

inclined O
to O
the O

belief O

None O
had O
given O
him O
much O
benefit O
of O
a O
doubt O

had O
faith O

innocence O

his O
mother O

there O
the O
heart O
loved O
more O

the O
head O

her O
yearning O
affection O

never O

entertained O
the O
idea O
that O
her O
Jem S-PERSON

a O
murderer O

Mary S-PERSON
disliked O
the O
whole O

subject O

the O
manner O
in O

it O
was O
treated O

were O
all O
painful O

she O
had O
a O
repugnance O
to O
the O
person O
with O
whom O
she O
spoke O

She O
was O
thankful O

therefore O
, O
when O
Job B-PERSON

voice O
was O
heard O
at O

as O
he O
stood O
with O
the O
latch O

up O

vexation O

" O
She O

Job S-PERSON
passed O
each O
other O
at O
the O

with O
mutual O
looks O

neither O

bad O
girl O

to O
Mary S-PERSON

" O
She's O
very O
good O

natured O

replied O
Mary S-PERSON

too O
honourable O

had O
only O
that O

his O
childer O
, O
as O

gudgeons O
with O

D'ye S-PERSON
think O
folk O
could O
be O
led O
astray O
by O
one O
who O
was O
every O
way O
bad O
? O
Howe'er O
, O
that's O
not O
what O
I O
came O
to O
talk O
about O
. O
I've O
seen O
Mr. O
Bridgenorth S-PERSON
, O
and O
he O
is O
in O
a O
manner O
of O
the O
same O
mind O
as O
me O

he O
thinks O
it O
would O
have O
an O
awkward O
look O
, O
and O
might O
tell O
against O
the O
poor O
lad O
on O
his O
trial O

still O
if O
she's O
ill O

ill O
, O

it O
can't O
be O
helped O

" O
" O
I O
don't O
know O
if O
she's O
so O
bad O
as O
all O
that O
, O
" O
said O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
who O
began O
to O
dread O
her O
part O
in O
doing O
any O
thing O

might O
tell O
against O
her O

" O
Will O
you O
come O

her O

The O
doctor O

as O
I O
liked O
, O
not O
as O
he O
thought O

" O
" O
That's O
because O

had O
no O

the O

either O
one S-CARDINAL

replied O
Job S-PERSON
, O
whose O
contempt O
for O
medical O
men O
pretty O
nearly O
equalled O
his O
respect O
for O

The O

Alice's S-PERSON

Mrs. O

So O
quietly O
, O
that O
it O
was O
unnatural O
under O
the O
circumstances O

It O
made O
a O
deeper O
impression O
on O
the O
old O
man O
than O
any O
token O
of O
mere O
bodily O
illness O
could O
have O
done O

If O
she O
had O
raved O
in O
delirium O
, O
or O
moaned O
in O
fever O
, O
he O
could O
have O
spoken O

given O
his O
opinion O

his O
advice O

his O
consolation O

now O
he O
was O
awed O
into O
silence O
. O
At O
length O
he O
pulled O
Mary S-PERSON
aside O
into O
a O
corner O
of O
the O
house O
- O
place O
where O
Mrs. O
Wilson S-PERSON
was O
sitting O
, O
and O
began O
to O
talk O
to O
her O
. O
" O
Yo're O
right O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
! O
She's O
no O
ways O
fit O
to O
go O
to O
Liverpool S-GPE
, O
poor O
soul O
. O
Now O
I've O
seen O
her O
, O
I O
only O
wonder O
the O
doctor O
could O
ha O
' O
been O
unsettled O
in O
his O
mind O
at O
th' O
first S-ORDINAL

Choose O
how O
it O
goes O
wi O
' O
poor O
Jem S-PERSON
, O
she O
cannot O
go O
. O
One S-CARDINAL
way O
or O
another O
it O
will O
soon O
be O
over O
, O
and O
best O
to O
leave O
her O
in O
the O
state O
she O
is O
till O
then O
. O
" O
" O
I O
was O
sure O
you O
would O
think O
so O
, O
" O
said O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
But O
they O
were O
reckoning O
without O
their O
host O
. O
They O
esteemed O
her O
senses O
gone O
, O
while O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
they O
were O
only O
inert O
, O
and O
could O
not O
convey O
impressions O
rapidly O
to O
the O
over O
- O
burdened O
, O
troubled O
brain O
. O
They O
had O
not O
noticed O
that O
her O
eyes O
had O
followed O
them O
( O
mechanically O
it O
seemed O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
) O
as O
they O
had O
moved O
away O
to O
the O
corner O
of O
the O
room O
| | O
that O
her O
face O
, O
hitherto O
so O
changeless O
, O
had O
begun O
to O
work O
with O
one S-CARDINAL
or O
two S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
old O
symptoms O
of O
impatience O
. O
But O
when O
they O
were O
silent O
she O
stood O
up O
, O
and O
startled O
them O
almost O
as O
if O
a O
dead O
person O
had O
spoken O
, O
by O
saying O
clearly O
and O
decidedly O
— O
" O
I O
go O
to O
Liverpool S-GPE
. O
I O
hear O
you O

your O
plans O

I O
tell O
you O
I O
shall O
go O
to O
Liverpool S-GPE

If O
my O
words O
are O
to O
kill O
my O
son O

they O
have O
already O
gone O
forth O
out O
of O
my O
mouth O
, O
and O
nought O
can O
bring O
them O
back O
. O
But O
I O
will O
have O
faith O
. O
Alice S-PERSON
( O
up O
above O
) O
has O
often O
telled O
me O
I O
wanted O
faith O
, O
and O
now O
I O
will O
have O
it O
. O
They O
cannot O
— O
they O
will O
not O
kill O
my O
child O

my O
only O
child O

I O
will O
not O
be O
afeared O
. O
Yet O
, O
oh O
! O
I O
am O
so O
sick O
with O
terror O
. O
But O
if O
he O
is O
to O
die O
, O
think O
ye O
not O
that O
I O
will O
see O
him O
again O

! O
see O
him O
at O
his O
trial O

all O
are O
hating O
him O

he O
shall O
have O
his O
poor O
mother O

him O

give O
him O
all O
the O
comfort O

eyes O

looks O

tears O

a O
heart O

is O
dead O
to O
all O

him O

can O
give O

his O
poor O
old O
mother O

who O
knows O
how O

he O
is O
from O
sin O

in O
the O
sight O
of O
man O
at O

. O
They'll O
let O
me O
go O
to O
him O
, O
maybe O
, O
the O
very O
minute O
it's O
over O

I O
know O
many O
Scripture S-WORK_OF_ART
texts O
( O
though O

not O

it O

that O
may O
keep O
up O

I O
missed O
seeing O
him O
ere O
he O
went O
to O
yon O
prison O
, O
but O
nought O
shall O
keep O
me O
away O
again O
one B-TIME
minute E-TIME
when O
I O
can O
see O
his O
face O

for O
maybe O
the O
minutes O
are O
numbered O

and O
the O
count O

small O

I O
know O

can O
be O

comfort O

poor O
lad O

You O
would O
not O

it O

now O

he'd O
alway O
speak O

soft O

dree O
all O
the O
cruel O
slander O
they'll O
put O
upon O
him O

I O
can O
pray O
for O
him O
at O
each O
hard O
word O
they O
say O
against O
him O
, O
if O
I O
can O
do O
nought O

he'll O
know O
what O
his O
mother O
is O
doing O
for O
him O
, O
poor O
lad O
, O
by O
the O
look O
on O
my O
face O

they O
made O
some O
look O

gesture O
of O
opposition O

her O
wishes O

She O
turned O
sharp O
round O
on O
Mary S-PERSON

the O
old O
object O
of O
her O
pettish O
attacks O

said O

my O

exhausted O

" O
Now O
Mary S-PERSON
disliked O
this O
plan O
inexpressibly O
| | O
her O
dislike O
was O
partly O
grounded O
on O
reason O
, O
and O
partly O
on O
feeling O
. O
She O
could O
not O
bear O
the O
idea O
of O
deputing O
to O
any O
one O
the O
active O
measures O
necessary O
to O
be O
taken O
in O
order O
to O
save O
Jem S-PERSON
. O
She O
felt O
as O
if O
they O
were O
her O
duty O
, O
her O
right O
. O
She O
durst O
not O
trust O
to O
any O
one O
the O
completion O
of O
her O
plan O

they O
might O
not O
have O
energy O
, O
or O
perseverance O
, O
or O
desperation O
enough O
to O
follow O
out O
the O
slightest O
chance O
| | O
and O
her O
love O
would O
endow O
her O
with O
all O
these O
qualities O
, O
independently O
of O
the O
terrible O
alternative O
which O
awaited O
her O
in O
case O
all O
failed O
and O
Jem S-PERSON
was O
condemned O
. O
No O
one O
could O
have O
her O
motives O

and O
consequently O
no O
one O
could O
have O
her O
sharpened O
brain O
, O
her O
despairing O
determination O
. O
Besides O
( O
only O
that O
was O
purely O
selfish O
) O
, O
she O
could O
not O
endure O
the O
suspense O
of O
remaining O
quiet O
, O
and O
only O
knowing O
the O
result O
when O
all O
was O
accomplished O
. O
So O
with O
vehemence O
and O
impatience O
she O
rebutted O
every O
reason O
Job O
adduced O
for O
his O
plan O

and O
of O
course O
, O
thus O
opposed O
, O
by O
what O
appeared O
to O
him O
wilfulness O
, O
he O
became O
more O
resolute O
, O
and O
angry O
words O
were O
exchanged O
, O
and O
a O
feeling O
of O
estrangement O
rose O
up O
between O
them O
, O
for O
a O
time O
, O
as O
they O
walked O
homewards O

But O
then O
came O
in O
Margaret S-PERSON
with O
her O
gentleness O
, O
like O
an O
angel O
of O
peace O
, O
so O
calm O

reasonable O
, O
that O
both O
felt O
ashamed O
of O

tacitly O
left O
the O
decision O

with O
some O
cause O

another O

she O
must O
rouse O
herself O
from O
the O
torpor O
of O
mind O

body O

was O
creeping O
over O
her O

result O
of O
much O
anxiety O

fatigue O

several O
sleepless O
nights O

She O
asked O
a O
policeman O
the O
way O
to O
Milk B-FAC
House I-FAC
Yard E-FAC
, O
and O
following O
his O
directions O
with O
the O
savoir O

of O
a O
town O
- O
bred O
girl O
, O
she O
reached O
a O
little O
court O
leading O
out O
of O
a O
busy O
, O
thronged O
street O
, O
not O
far O
from O
the O
Docks S-LOC
. O
When O
she O
entered O
the O
quiet O
little O
yard O
she O
stopped O
to O
regain O
her O
breath O
, O
and O
to O
gather O
strength O
, O
for O
her O
limbs O
trembled O
, O
and O
her O
heart O
beat O
violently O

All O
the O
unfavourable O
contingencies O
she O
had O
, O
until O
now O
, O
forbidden O
herself O
to O
dwell O
upon O

came O
forward O
to O
her O
mind O
. O
The O
possibility O
, O
the O
bare O
possibility O
, O
of O
Jem S-PERSON
being O
an O
accomplice O
in O
the O
murder O

the O
still O
greater O
possibility O
that O
he O
had O
not O
fulfilled O
his O
intention O
of O
going O
part O
of O
the O
way O
with O
Will S-PERSON
, O
but O
had O
been O
led O
off O
by O
some O
little O
accidental O
occurrence O
from O
his O
original O
intention O

and O
that O
he O
had O
spent O
the O
evening O
with O
those O

whom O
it O
was O
now O
too O
late O
to O
bring O
forward O

witnesses O

But O
sooner O
or O
later O
she O
must O
know O
the O
truth O

so O
taking O
courage O
she O
knocked O
at O
the O
door O
of O
a O
house O
. O
" O
Is O
this O
Mrs. O
Jones's S-PERSON
? O
" O
she O
inquired O
. O
" O
Next O
door O
but O
one O
, O
" O
was O
the O
curt O
answer O
. O
And O
even O
this B-TIME
extra I-TIME
minute E-TIME
was O
a O
reprieve O
. O
Mrs. O
Jones S-PERSON
was O
busy O
washing O
, O
and O
would O
have O
spoken O
angrily O
to O
the O
person O
who O
knocked O
so O
gently O
at O
the O
door O
, O
if O
anger O
had O
been O
in O
her O
nature O
| | O
but O
she O
was O
a O
soft O
, O
helpless O
kind O
of O
woman O
, O
and O
only O
sighed O
over O
the O
many O
interruptions O
she O
had O
had O
to O
her O
business O
that O
unlucky O
Monday B-TIME
morning E-TIME
. O
But O
the O
feeling O
which O
would O
have O
been O
anger O
in O
a O
more O
impatient O
temper O
, O
took O
the O
form O
of O
prejudice O
against O
the O
disturber O
, O
whoever O
he O
or O
she O
might O
be O
. O
Mary's S-PERSON
fluttered O
and O
excited O
appearance O
strengthened O
this O
prejudice O
in O
Mrs. O
Jones's S-PERSON
mind O
, O
as O
she O
stood O
, O
stripping O
the O
soap O
- O
suds O
off O
her O
arms O
, O
while O
she O
eyed O
her O
visitor O
, O
and O
waited O
to O
be O
told O
what O
her O
business O
was O
. O
But O
no O
words O
would O
come O
. O
Mary's S-PERSON
voice O
seemed O
choked O
up O
in O
her O
throat O
. O
" O
Pray O
what O
do O
you O
want O
, O
young O
woman O
? O
" O
coldly O
asked O
Mrs. O
Jones S-PERSON
at O
last O
. O
" O
I O
want O
— O
Oh O
! O
is O
Will B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
here O
? O
" O
" O
No O
, O
he O

not O

" O
replied O
Mrs. O
Jones S-PERSON
, O
inclining O
to O
shut O
the O
door O
in O
her O
face O
. O
" O
Is O
he O
not O
come O
back O
from O
the O
Isle O

" O
asked O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
sickening O
. O
" O
He O
never O
went O

stayed O
in O

too O
long O

perhaps O
you O
know O

already O

And O
again O
the O
door O
seemed O
closing O
. O
But O
Mary S-PERSON
bent O
forwards O
with O
suppliant O
action O
( O
as O
some O
young O
tree O
bends O
, O
when O
blown O
by O
the O
rough O
, O
autumnal O

gasped O
out O
, O
" O

me O

tell O
me O
— O
where O

" O
Mrs. O
Jones S-PERSON
suspected O
some O
love O
affair O
, O
and O
, O
perhaps O
, O
one O
of O
not O
the O
most O
creditable O
kind O

but O
the O
distress O
of O
the O
pale O
young O
creature O
before O
her O
was O
so O
obvious O
and O
so O
pitiable O
, O
that O
were O
she O
ever O
so O
sinful O
, O
Mrs. O
Jones S-PERSON
could O
no O
longer O
uphold O
her O
short O
, O
reserved O
manner O

sight O
compared O
with O

thing O

Mary S-PERSON
had O
ever O
seen O
, O
made O
her O
feel O
most O
helpless O
and O
forlorn O

and O
she O
clung O
to O
her O
young O
guide O
as O
to O
one O
who O
alone O
by O
his O
superior O
knowledge O
could O
interpret O
between O
her O
and O
the O
new O
race O
of O
men O
by O
whom O
she O
was O
surrounded O
, O
— O
for O
a O
new O
race O

might O
reasonably O
be O
considered O
, O
to O
a O
girl O
who O
had O
hitherto O
seen O
none O
but O
inland O
dwellers O
, O
and O
those O
for O
the O
greater O
part O
factory O
people O
. O
In O
that O
new O
world O
of O
sight O
and O
sound O
, O
she O
still O
bore O
one S-CARDINAL
prevailing O
thought O
, O
and O
though O
her O
eye O
glanced O
over O
the O
ships O
and O
the O
wide O
- O
spreading O
river O
, O
her O
mind O
was O
full O
of O
the O
thought O
of O
reaching O
Will O
. O
" O
Why O
are O
we O
here O
? O
" O
asked O
she O
of O
Charley S-PERSON
. O
" O
There O
are O
no O
little O
boats O
about O
, O
and O
I O
thought O
I O
was O
to O
go O
in O
a O
little O
boat O

they O

" O
" O
To O
be O
sure O
not O
, O
" O
replied O
he O
, O
rather O
contemptuously O
. O
" O
But O
the B-PERSON
John I-PERSON

lay O
in O
this O
dock O
, O
and O
I O
know O
many O
of O
the O
sailors O

and O
if O
I O
could O
see O
one O
I O
knew O
, O
I'd O
ask O
him O
to O
run O
up O
the O
mast O
, O
and O
see O
if O
he O
could O
catch O
a O
sight O
of O
her O
in O
the O
offing O

she's O
weighed O
her O
anchor O
no O

for O
your O
going O

" O
Mary S-PERSON
assented O
quietly O
to O
this O
speech O
, O
as O
if O
she O
were O
as O
careless O
as O
Charley S-PERSON
seemed O
now O
to O
be O
about O
her O
overtaking O
Will O

but O
in O
truth O
her O
heart O
was O
sinking O
within O
her O
, O
and O
she O
no O
longer O
felt O
the O
energy O
which O
had O
hitherto O
upheld O
her O
. O
Her O
bodily O
strength O
was O
giving O
way O
, O
and O
she O
stood O
cold O
and O
shivering O
, O
although O
the O
noon O
- O
day O
sun O
beat O
down O
with O
considerable O
power O
on O
the O
shadeless O
spot O
where O
she O
was O
standing O

" O
Here's B-PERSON
Tom I-PERSON

" O
said O
Charley S-PERSON

and O
altering O
his O
manner O
from O
the O
patronising O
key O
in O
which O
he O
had O
spoken O
to O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
he O
addressed O
a O
weather O
- O
beaten O
old O
sailor O
who O
came O
rolling O
along O
the O
pathway O
where O
they O
stood O
, O
his O
hands O
in O
his O
pockets O
, O
and O
his O
quid O
in O
his O
mouth O
, O
with O
very O
much O
the O
air O
of O
one O
who O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
but O
look O
about O
him O
, O
and O
spit O
right O
and O
left O

addressing O
this O
old O
tar O
, O
Charley S-PERSON
made O
known O
to O
him O
his O
wish O
in O
slang O
, O
which O
to O
Mary S-PERSON
was O
almost O
inaudible O
, O
and O
quite O
unintelligible O
, O
and O
which O
I O
am O
too O
much O
of O
a O
land O
- O
lubber O
to O
repeat O
correctly O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
watched O
looks O
and O
actions O
with O
a O
renovated O
keenness O
of O
perception O
. O
She O
saw O
the O
old O
man O
listen O
attentively O
to O
Charley S-PERSON

she O
saw O
him O
eye O
her O
over O
from O
head O
to O
foot O
, O
and O
wind O
up O
his O
inspection O
with O
a O
little O
nod O
of O
approbation O
( O
for O
her O
very O
shabbiness O
and O
poverty O
of O
dress O
were O
creditable O
signs O
to O
the O
experienced O
old O
sailor O
) O

and O
then O
she O
watched O
him O
leisurely O
swing O
himself O
on O
to O
a O
ship O
in O
the O
basin O
, O
and O
, O
borrowing O
a O
glass O
, O
run O
up O
the O
mast O
with O
the O
speed O
of O
a O
monkey O
. O
" O
He'll O
fall O

said O
she O
, O
in O
affright O

clutching O
at O
Charley's S-PERSON
arm O
, O
and O
judging O
the O
sailor O
, O
from O
his O
storm O
- O
marked O
face O

unsteady O
walk O
on O
land O

be O
much O
older O
than O
he O
really O
was O

" O
Not O

Charley S-PERSON

" O
He's O
at O

looking O
through O

I've O
been O
up O

many O

many O
a O
time O

only O
don't O
tell O
mother O

She O
thinks O
I'm O
to O
be O
a O
shoemaker O
, O

I've O
made O
up O
my O
mind O

no O
good O

" O
But O
unable O
to O
wait O
another O

she O
called O
out O
herself O

he O

coming O
quickly O
up O
to O
them O

hurried O
them O
away O

for O

boat O

They O
ran O
to O
some O
steps O
leading O
down O
to O
the O
water O

beckoned O
to O

watermen O

who O
, O
suspecting O
the O
real O
state O

the O
case O

appeared O
in O
no O

leisurely O
brought O
their O
boat O
alongside O

pause O
. O
Both O
wind O
and O
tide O
were O
against O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
men O
, O
and O
labour O
as O
they O
would O
they O
made O
but O
little O
way O
. O
Once O
Mary S-PERSON
in O
her O
impatience O
had O
risen O
up O
to O
obtain O
a O
better O
view O
of O
the O
progress O
they O
had O
made O
, O
but O
the O
men O
had O
roughly O
told O
her O
to O
sit O
down O
immediately O
, O
and O
she O
had O
dropped O
on O
her O
seat O
like O
a O
chidden O
child O
, O
although O
the O
impatience O
was O
still O
at O
her O
heart O
. O
But O
now O
she O
grew O
sure O
they O
were O
turning O
off O
from O
the O
straight O
course O
which O
they O
had O
hitherto O
kept O
on O
the O
Cheshire S-GPE
side O
of O
the O
river O
, O
whither O
they O
had O
gone O
to O
avoid O
the O
force O
of O
the O
current O
, O
and O
after O
a O
short O
time O
she O
could O
not O
help O
naming O
her O
conviction O
, O
as O
a O
kind O
of O
nightmare O
dread O
and O
belief O
came O
over O
her O
, O
that O
every O
thing O
animate O
and O
inanimate O
was O
in O
league O
against O
her O
one S-CARDINAL
sole O
aim O
and O
object O
of O
overtaking O
Will S-PERSON
. O
They O
answered O
gruffly O
. O
They O
saw O
a O
boatman O
whom O
they O
knew O
, O
and O
were O
desirous O
of O
obtaining O
his O
services O
as O
steersman O
, O
so O
that O
both O
might O
row O
with O
greater O
effect O
. O
They O
knew O
what O
they O
were O
about O
. O
So O
she O
sat O
silent O
with O
clenched O
hands O
while O
the O
parley O
went O
on O
, O
the O
explanation O
was O
given O
, O
the O
favour O
asked O
and O
granted O
. O
But O
she O
was O
sickening O
all O
the O
time O
with O
nervous O
fear O
. O
They O
had O
been O
rowing O
a O
long O
, O
long O
time O
— O
half O
a O
day O
it O
seemed O
, O
at O
least O
— O
yet O
Liverpool S-GPE
appeared O
still O
close O
at O
hand O
, O
and O
Mary S-PERSON
began O
almost O
to O
wonder O
that O
the O
men O
were O
not O
as O
much O
disheartened O
as O
she O
was O
, O
when O
the O
wind O
, O
which O
had O
been O
hitherto O
against O
them O
, O
dropped O
, O
and O
thin O
clouds O
began O
to O
gather O
over O
the O
sky O
, O
shutting O
out O
the O
sun O
, O
and O
casting O
a O
chilly O
gloom O
over O
every O
thing O
. O
There O
was O
not O
a O
breath O
of O
air O
, O
and O
yet O
it O
was O
colder O
than O
when O
the O
soft O
violence O
of O
the O
westerly O
wind O
had O
been O
felt O
. O
The O
men O
renewed O
their O
efforts O
. O
The O
boat O
gave O
a O
bound O
forwards O
at O
every O
pull O
of O
the O
oars O
. O
The O
water O
was O
glassy O
and O
motionless O
, O
reflecting O
tint O
by O
tint O
of O
the O
Indian S-NORP
- O
ink O
sky O
above O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
shivered O
, O
and O
her O
heart O
sank O
within O
her O
. O
Still O
now O
they O
evidently O
were O
making O
progress O
. O
Then O
the O
steersman O
pointed O
to O
a O
rippling O
line O
in O
the O
river O
only O
a O
little O
way O
off O
, O
and O
the O
men O
disturbed O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
watching O
the O
ships O
that O
lay O
in O
what O
appeared O
to O
her O
the O
open O
sea O
, O
to O
get O
at O
their O
sails O
. O
She O
gave O
a O
little O
start O
, O
and O
rose O
. O
Her O
patience O
, O
her O
grief O
, O
and O
perhaps O
her O
silence O
, O
had O
begun O
to O
win O
upon O
the O
men O
. O
" O
Yon O
second S-ORDINAL
to O
the O
norrard O
is O
the B-PERSON
John I-PERSON
Cropper E-PERSON
. O
Wind's O
right O
now O
, O
and O
sails O
will O
soon O
carry O
us O
alongside O
of O
her O
. O
" O
He O
had O
forgotten O
( O
or O
perhaps O
he O
did O
not O
like O
to O
remind O
Mary S-PERSON
) O
that O
the O
same O
wind O
which O
now O
bore O
their O
little O
craft O
along O
with O
easy O
, O
rapid O
motion O
, O
would O
also O
be O
favourable O
to O
the B-PERSON
John I-PERSON
Cropper E-PERSON
. O
But O
as O
they O
looked O
with O
straining O
eyes O
, O
as O
if O
to O
measure O
the O
decreasing O
distance O
that O
separated O
them O
from O
her O
, O
they O
saw O
her O
sails O
unfurled O
and O
flap O
in O
the O
breeze O
, O
till O
, O
catching O
the O
right O
point O
, O
they O
bellied O
forth O
into O
white O
roundness O
, O
and O
the O
ship O
began O
to O
plunge O
and O
heave O
, O
as O
if O
she O
were O
a O
living O
creature O
, O
impatient O
to O
be O
off O
. O
" O
They're O
heaving O
anchor O
! O
" O
said O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
boatmen O
to O
the O
others O
, O
as O
the O
faint O
musical O
cry O
of O
the O
sailors O
came O
floating O
over O
the O
waters O
that O
still O
separated O
them O
. O
Full O
of O
the O
spirit O
of O
the O
chase O
, O
though O
as O
yet O
ignorant O
of O
Mary's S-PERSON
motives O
, O
the O
men O
sprang O
to O
hoist O
another O
sail O
. O
It O
was O
fully O
as O
much O
as O
the O
boat O
could O
bear O
, O
in O
the O
keen O
, O
gusty O
east O
wind O
which O
was O
now O
blowing O
, O
and O
she O
bent O
, O
and O
laboured O
, O
and O
ploughed O
, O
and O
creaked O
upbraidingly O
as O
if O
tasked O
beyond O
her O
strength O
| | O
but O
she O
sped O
along O
with O
a O
gallant O
swiftness O
. O
They O
drew O
nearer O
, O
and O
they O
heard O
the O
distant O
" O
ahoy O
" O
more O
clearly O
. O
It O
ceased O
. O
The O
anchor O
was O
up O
, O
and O
the O
ship O
was O
away O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
stood O
up O
, O
steadying O
herself O
by O
the O
mast O
, O
and O
stretched O
out O
her O
arms O
, O
imploring O
the O
flying O
vessel O
to O
stay O
its O
course O
by O
that O
mute O
action O
, O
while O
the O
tears O
streamed O
down O
her O
cheeks O
. O
The O
men O
caught O
up O
their O
oars O
and O
hoisted O
them O
in O
the O
air O
, O
and O
shouted O
to O
arrest O
attention O
. O
They O
were O
seen O
by O
the O
men O
aboard O
the O
larger O
craft O
| | O
but O
they O
were O
too O
busy O
with O
all O
the O
confusion O
prevalent O
in O
an O
outward O
- O
bound O
vessel O
to O
pay O
much O
attention O
. O
There O
were O
coils O
of O
ropes O
and O
seamen's O
chests O
to O
be O
stumbled O
over O
at O
every O
turn O
| | O
there O
were O
animals O
, O
not O
properly O
secured O
, O
roaming O
bewildered O
about O
the O
deck O
, O
adding O
their O
pitiful O
lowings O
and O
bleatings O
to O
the O
aggregate O
of O
noises O
. O
There O
were O
carcases O
not O
cut O
up O
, O
looking O
like O
corpses O
of O
sheep O
and O
pigs O
rather O
than O
like O
mutton O
and O
pork O
| | O
there O
were O
sailors O
running O
here O
and O
there O
and O
everywhere O
, O
having O
had O
no O
time O
to O
fall O
into O
method O
, O
and O
with O
their O
minds O
divided O
between O
thoughts O
of O
the O
land O
and O
the O
people O
they O
had O
left O
, O
and O
the O
present O
duties O
on O
board O
ship O
| | O
while O
the O
captain O
strove O
hard O
to O
procure O
some O
kind O
of O
order O
by O
hasty O
commands O
given O
in O
a O
loud O
, O
impatient O
voice O
, O
to O
right O
and O
left O
, O
starboard O
and O
larboard O
, O
cabin O
and O
steerage O
. O
As O
he O
paced O
the O
deck O
with O
a O
chafed O
step O
, O
vexed O
at O
one B-CARDINAL
or I-CARDINAL
two E-CARDINAL
little O
mistakes O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
mate O
, O
and O
suffering O
himself O
from O
the O
pain O
of O
separation O
from O
wife O
and O
children O
, O
but O
showing O
his O
suffering O
only O
by O
his O
outward O
irritation O
, O
he O
heard O
a O
hail O
from O
the O
shabby O
little O
river O
- O
boat O
that O
was O
striving O
to O
overtake O
his O
winged O
ship O
. O
For O
the O
men O
fearing O
that O
, O
as O
the O
ship O
was O
now O
fairly O
over O
the O
bar O
, O
they O
should O
only O
increase O
the O
distance O
between O
them O
, O
and O
being O
now O
within O
shouting O
range O
, O
had O
asked O
of O
Mary S-PERSON
her O
more O
particular O
desire O
. O
Her O
throat O
was O
dry O
| | O
all O
musical O
sound O
had O
gone O
out O
of O
her O
voice O
| | O
but O
in O
a O
loud O
harsh O
whisper O
she O
told O
the O
men O
her O
errand O
of O
life O
and O
death O
, O
and O
they O
hailed O
the O
ship O
. O
" O
We're O
come O
for O
one O
William B-PERSON

with O
William B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON

Any O
thing O

" O
asked O
the O
boat O
- O
man O
of O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
lower O
voice O
, O
and O
taking O
his O
hands O
down O
from O
his O
mouth O

" O

for O
the O
love O

Heaven O
, O
ask O
them O
to O
stop O

" O
The O
boatman O
was O
angry O
at O
the O
little O
regard O
paid O
to O
his O
summons O
, O
and O
called O
out O
again O
| | O
repeating O
the O
message O
with O
the O
name O
of O
the O
young O
woman O
who O
sent O
it O
, O
and O
interlarding O
it O
with O
sailors' O
oaths O
. O
The O
ship O
flew O
along O
— O
away O
, O
— O
the O
boat O
struggled O
after O
. O
They O
could O
see O
the O
captain O
take O
his O
speaking O
- O
trumpet O
. O
And O
oh O
! O
and O
alas O
! O
they O
heard O
his O
words O
. O
He O
swore O
a O
dreadful O
oath O
| | O
he O
called O
Mary S-PERSON
a O
disgraceful O
name O

and O
he O
said O
he O
would O
not O
stop O
his O
ship O
for O
any O
one O

nor O
could O
he O
part O
with O
a O
single O
hand O
, O
whoever O
swung O
for O
it O
. O
The O
words O
came O
in O
unpitying O
clearness O
with O
their O
trumpet O
- O
sound O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
sat O
down O
, O
looking O
like O
one O
who O
prays O
in O
the O
death O
- O
agony O
. O
For O
her O
eyes O
were O
turned O
up O
to O
that O
Heaven O
, O
where O
mercy O
dwelleth O
, O
while O
her O
blue O
lips O
quivered O
, O
though O
no O
sound O
came O

Then O
she O
bowed O
her O
head O

hid O
it O
in O
her O
hands O

" O
Hark S-PERSON

yon O

She O
looked O
up O

And O
her O
heart O
stopped O
its O
beating O
to O
listen O

William B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
stood O
as O
near O
the O
stern O
of O
the O
vessel O

could O
get O

unable O

obtain O
the O
trumpet O
from O
the O
angry O

made O
a O
tube O
of O
his O

wildly O

as O
the O
voice O
died O
away O
in O
the O
increasing O
distance O

the O

cheered O

she O

" O

her O
ears O

her O
brain O
refused O
to O
recognise O
the O
sense O

repeated O
his O
speech O

all O
three S-CARDINAL
speaking O
at O
once O

with O
many O
comments O

Mary S-PERSON
looked O
at O

at O

away O

" O

pilot O
- O
boat O
? O
" O
They O
told O
her O
, O
and O
she O
gathered O
the O
meaning O
out O
of O
the O
sailors' O
slang O
which O
enveloped O
it O
. O
There O
was O
a O
hope O
still O
, O
although O
so O
slight O
and O
faint O
. O
" O
How O
far O
does O
the O
pilot O
go O
with O
the O
ship O
? O
" O
To O
different O
distances O
they O
said O
. O
Some O
pilots O
would O
go O
as O
far O
as O
Holyhead S-GPE
for O
the O
chance O
of O
the O
homeward O
- O
bound O
vessels O
| | O
others O
only O
took O
the O
ships O
over O
the O
Banks S-ORG
. O
Some O
captains O
were O
more O
cautious O
than O
others O
, O
and O
the O
pilots O
had O
different O
ways O
. O
The O
wind O
was O
against O
the O
homeward O
bound O
vessels O
, O
so O
perhaps O
the O
pilot O
aboard O
the B-PRODUCT
John I-PRODUCT
Cropper E-PRODUCT
would O
not O
care O
to O
go O
far O
out O
. O
" O
How O
soon O
would O
he O
come O
back O
? O
" O
There O
were O
three S-CARDINAL
boatmen O
, O
and O
three S-CARDINAL
opinions O
, O
varying O
from O
twelve B-TIME
hours E-TIME
to O
two B-DATE
days E-DATE
. O
Nay S-PERSON
, O
the O
man O
who O
gave O
his O
vote O
for O
the O
longest O
time O
, O
on O
having O
his O
judgment O
disputed O
, O
grew O
stubborn O
, O
and O
doubled O
the O
time O
, O
and O
thought O
it O
might O
be O
the B-DATE
end I-DATE
of I-DATE
the I-DATE
week E-DATE
before O
the O
pilot O
- O
boat O
came O
home O
. O
They O
began O
disputing O
, O
and O
urging O
reasons O
| | O
and O
Mary S-PERSON
tried O
to O
understand O
them O
| | O
but O
independently O
of O
their O
nautical O
language O
, O
a O
veil O
seemed O
drawn O
over O
her O
mind O
, O
and O
she O
had O
no O
clear O
perception O
of O
any O
thing O
that O
passed O
. O
Her O
very O
words O
seemed O
not O
her O
own O
, O
and O
beyond O
her O
power O
of O
control O
, O
for O
she O
found O
herself O
speaking O
quite O
differently O
to O
what O
she O
meant O
. O
One S-CARDINAL
by O
one O
her O
hopes O
had O
fallen O
away O
, O
and O
left O
her O
desolate O
| | O
and O
though O
a O
chance O
yet O
remained O
, O
she O
could O
no O
longer O
hope O
. O
She O
felt O
certain O
it O
, O
too O
, O
would O
fade O
and O
vanish O
. O
She O
sank O
into O
a O
kind O
of O
stupor O
. O
All O
outward O
objects O
harmonised O
with O
her O
despair O
. O
The O
gloomy O
leaden O
sky O
, O
— O
the O
deep O
, O
dark O
waters O
below O
, O
of O
a O
still O
heavier O
shade O
of O
colour O
, O
— O
the O
cold O
, O
flat O
yellow O
shore O
in O
the O
distance O
, O
which O
no O
ray O
lightened O
up O
, O
— O
the O
nipping O
, O
cutting O
wind O
. O
She O
shivered O
with O
her O
depression O
of O
mind O
and O
body O
. O
The O
sails O
were O
taken O
down O
, O
of O
course O
, O
on O
the O
return O
to O
Liverpool S-GPE
, O
and O
the O
progress O
they O
made O
, O
rowing O
and O
tacking O
, O
was O
very O
slow O
. O
The O
men O
talked O
together O
, O
disputing O
about O
the O
pilots O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
, O
and O
then O
about O
matters O
of O
local O
importance O
, O
in O
which O
Mary S-PERSON
would O
have O
taken O
no O
interest O
at O
any O
time O
, O
and O
she O
gradually O
became O
drowsy O
| | O
irrepressibly O
so O
, O
indeed O
, O
for O
in O
spite O
of O
her O
jerking O
efforts O
to O
keep O
awake O
she O
sank O
away O
to O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
boat O
, O
and O
there O
lay O
couched O
on O
a O
rough O
heap O
of O
sails O
, O
rope O
, O
and O
tackle O
of O
various O
kinds O
. O
The O
measured O
beat O
of O
the O
waters O
against O
the O
sides O
of O
the O
boat O
, O
and O
the O
musical O
boom O
of O
the O
more O
distant O
waves O
, O
were O
more O
lulling O
than O
silence O
, O
and O
she O
slept O
sound O
. O
Once O
she O
opened O
her O
eyes O
heavily O
, O
and O
dimly O
saw O
the O
old O
gray O
, O
rough O
boatman O
( O
who O
had O
stood O
out O
the O
most O
obstinately O
for O
the O
full O
fare O
) O
covering O
her O
with O
his O
thick O
pea-jacket O
. O
He O
had O
taken O
it O
off O
on O
purpose O
, O
and O
was O
doing O
it O
tenderly O
in O
his O
way O
, O
but O
before O
she O
could O
rouse O
herself O
up O
to O
thank O
him O
she O
had O
dropped O
off O
to O
sleep O
again O
. O
At O
last O
, O
in O
the O
dusk O
of O
evening O
, O
they O
arrived O
at O
the O
landing O
- O
place O
from O
which O
they O
had O
started O
some B-TIME
hours E-TIME
before O
. O
The O
men O
spoke O
to O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
but O
though O
she O
mechanically O
replied O
, O
she O
did O
not O
stir O
| | O
so O
, O
at O
length O
, O
they O
were O
obliged O
to O
shake O
her O
. O
She O
stood O
up O
, O
shivering O
and O
puzzled O
as O
to O
her O
whereabouts O
. O
" O
Now O
tell O
me O
where O
you O
are O
bound O
to O
, O
missis O
, O
" O
said O
the O
gray O
old O
man O
, O
" O
and O
maybe O
I O
can O
put O
you O
in O
the O
way O
. O
" O
She O
slowly O
comprehended O
what O
he O
said O
, O
and O
went O
through O
the O
process O
of O
recollection O
| | O
but O
very O
dimly O
, O
and O
with O
much O
labour O
. O
She O
put O
her O
hand O
into O
her O
pocket O
and O
pulled O
out O
her O
purse O
, O
and O
shook O
its O
contents O
into O
the O
man's O
hand O
| | O
and O
then O
began O
meekly O
to O
unpin O
her O
shawl O
, O
although O
they O
had O
turned O
away O
without O
asking O
for O
it O
. O
" O
No O
, O
no O
! O
" O
said O
the O
older O
man O
, O
who O
lingered O
on O
the O
step O
before O
springing O
into O
the O
boat O
, O
and O
to O
whom O
she O
mutely O
offered O
the O
shawl O
. O
" O
Keep O
it O
! O
we O
donnot O
want O
it O
. O
It O
were O
only O
for O
to O
try O
you O
, O
— O
some O
folks O
say O
they've O
no O
more O
blunt O
, O
when O
all O
the O
while O
they've O
getten O
a O
mint O
. O
" O
" O
Thank O
you O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
in O
a O
dull O
, O
low O
tone O
. O
" O
Where O
are O
you O
bound O
to O
? O
I O
axed O
that O
question O
afore O
, O
" O
said O
the O
gruff O
old O
fellow O
. O
" O
I O
don't O
know O
. O
I'm O
a O
stranger O
, O
" O
replied O
she O
, O
quietly O
, O
with O
a O
strange O
absence O
of O
anxiety O
under O
the O
circumstances O
. O
" O
But O
you O
mun O
find O
out O
then O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
sharply O
, O
" O
pier O
- O
head's O
no O
place O
for O
a O
young O
woman O
to O
be O
standing O
on O

gape O
- O
saying O
. O
" O
" O
I've O
a O
card O
somewhere O
as O
will O
tell O
me O
, O
" O
she O
answered O
, O
and O
the O
man O
, O
partly O
relieved O
, O
jumped O
into O
the O
boat O
, O
which O
was O
now O
pushing O
off O
to O
make O
way O
for O
the O
arrivals O
from O
some O
steamer O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
felt O
in O
her O
pocket O
for O
the O
card O
, O
on O
which O
was O
written O
the O
name O
of O
the O
street O
where O
she O
was O
to O
have O
met O
Mr. O
Bridgenorth S-PERSON
at O
two B-TIME
o'clock E-TIME
| | O
where O
Job S-PERSON
and O
Mrs. O
Wilson S-PERSON
were O
to O
have O
been O
, O
and O
where O
she O
was O
to O
have O
learnt O
from O
the O
former O
the O
particulars O
of O
some O
respectable O
lodging O
. O
It O
was O
not O
to O
be O
found O
. O
She O
tried O
to O
brighten O
her O
perceptions O
, O
and O
felt O
again O
, O
and O
took O
out O
the O
little O
articles O
her O
pocket O
contained O
, O
her O
empty O
purse O
, O
her O
pocket O
- O
handkerchief O
, O
and O
such O
little O
things O
, O
but O
it O
was O
not O
there O
. O
In O
fact O
she O
had O
dropped O
it O
when O
, O
so O
eager O
to O
embark O
, O
she O
had O
pulled O
out O
her O
purse O
to O
reckon O
up O
her O
money O
. O
She O
did O
not O
know O
this O
, O
of O
course O
. O
She O
only O
knew O
it O
was O
gone O
. O
It O
added O
but O
little O
to O
the O
despair O
that O
was O
creeping O
over O
her O
. O
But O
she O
tried O
a O
little O
more O
to O
help O
herself O
, O
though O
every O
minute O
her O
mind O
became O
more O
cloudy O
. O
She O
strove O
to O
remember O
where O
Will S-PERSON
had O
lodged O
, O
but O
she O
could O
not O
| | O
name O
, O
street O
, O
every O
thing O
had O
passed O
away O
, O
and O
it O
did O
not O
signify O
| | O
better O
she O
were O
lost O
than O
found O
. O
She O
sat O
down O
quietly O
on O
the O
top O
step O
of O
the O
landing O
, O
and O
gazed O
down O
into O
the O
dark O
, O
dank O
water O
below O
. O
Once O
or O
twice O
a O
spectral O
thought O
loomed O
among O
the O
shadows O
of O
her O
brain O
| | O
a O
wonder O
whether O
beneath O
that O
cold O
dismal O
surface O
there O
would O
not O
be O
rest O
from O
the O
troubles O
of O
earth O
. O
But O
she O
could O
not O
hold O
an O
idea O
before O
her O
for O
two S-CARDINAL
consecutive O
moments O
| | O
and O
she O
forgot O
what O
she O
thought O
about O
before O
she O
could O
act O
upon O
it O
. O
So O
she O
continued O
sitting O
motionless O
, O
without O
looking O
up O
, O
or O
regarding O
in O
any O
way O
the O
insults O
to O
which O
she O
was O
subjected O
. O
Through O
the O
darkening O
light O
the O
old O
boatman O
had O
watched O
her O
: O
interested O
in O
her O
in O
spite O
of O
himself O
, O
and O
his O
scoldings O
of O
himself O
. O
When O
the O
landing O
- O
place O
was O
once O
more O
comparatively O
clear O
, O
he O
made O
his O
way O
towards O
it O
, O
across O
boats O
, O
and O
along O
planks O
, O
swearing O
at O
himself O
while O
he O
did O
so O
, O
for O
an O
old O
fool O
. O
He O
shook O
Mary's S-PERSON
shoulder O
violently O
. O
" O
D O

" O

" O
She O
looked O
again O
down O
upon O
the O
black O
mirror O
below O
. O
He O
stood O
by O
her O
, O
striving O
to O
put O
down O
his O
better O
self O

but O
he O
could O
not O
. O
He O
shook O
her O
again O
. O
She O
looked O
up O
, O
as O
if O
she O
had O
forgotten O
him O
. O
" O
What O
do O
you O
want O

" O
asked O
she O

wearily O

" O

" O
replied O
he O
, O
clutching O
her O
arm O
to O
pull O
her O
up O
. O
She O
arose O
and O
followed O
him O
, O
with O
the O
unquestioning O
docility O
of O
a O
little O
child O

Mary S-PERSON
: O
a O
room O
which O
had O
frequently O
been O
his O
, O
on O
his O
occasional O
visits O
to O
Liverpool S-GPE
, O
but O
which O
he O
was O
thankful O
now O
to O
have O
obtained O
for O
them O
, O
as O
his O
own O
sleeping O
- O
place O
was O
a O
matter O
of O
indifference O
to O
him O
, O
and O
the O
town O
appeared O
crowded O
and O
disorderly O
on O
the O
eve O
of O
the O
Assizes O
. O
He O
was O
shown O
in O
to O
Mr. O
Bridgenorth S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
writing O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
and O
Will B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
had O
not O
yet O
arrived O
, O
being O
, O
as O
you O
know O
, O
far O
away O
on O
the O
broad O
sea O
| | O
but O
of O
this O
Job O
of O
course O
knew O
nothing O
, O
and O
he O
did O
not O
as O
yet O
feel O
much O
anxiety O
about O
their O
non-appearance O
| | O
he O
was O
more O
curious O
to O
know O
the O
result O
of O
Mr. O
Bridgenorth's S-PERSON
interview O
that O
morning O
with O
Jem S-PERSON
. O
" O
Why O
, O
yes O
, O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Bridgenorth S-PERSON
, O
putting O
down O
his O
pen O
, O
" O
I O
have O
seen O
him O
, O
but O
to O
little O
purpose O
, O
I'm O
afraid O
. O
He's O
very O
impracticable O
— O
very O
. O
I O
told O
him O
, O
of O
course O
, O
that O
he O
must O
be O
perfectly O
open O
with O
me O
, O
or O
else O
I O
could O
not O
be O
prepared O
for O
the O
weak O
points O
. O
I O
named O
your O
name O
with O
the O
view O
of O
unlocking O
his O
confidence O
, O
but O
— O
" O
" O
What O
did O
he O
say O
? O
" O
asked O
Job S-PERSON
, O
breathlessly O
. O
" O
Why O
, O
very O
little O
. O
He O
barely O
answered O
me O
. O
Indeed O
, O
he O
refused O
to O
answer O
some O
questions O
— O
positively O
refused O
. O
I O
don't O
know O
what O
I O
can O
do O
for O
him O
. O
" O
" O
Then O
you O
think O
him O
guilty O
, O
sir O
? O
" O
said O
Job S-PERSON
, O
despondingly O
. O
" O
No O
, O
I O
don't O
, O
" O
replied O
Mr. O
Bridgenorth S-PERSON
, O
quickly O
and O
decisively O
. O
" O
Much O
less O
than O
I O
did O
before O
I O
saw O
him O
. O
The O
impression O
( O
mind O
, O
' O
tis O
only O
impression O
| | O
I O
rely O
upon O
your O
caution O
, O
not O
to O
take O
it O
for O
fact O
) O
— O
the O
impression O
, O
" O
with O
an O
emphasis O
on O
the O
word O
, O
" O
he O
gave O
me O
is O
, O
that O
he O
knows O
something O
about O
the O
affair O
, O
but O
what O
, O
he O
will O
not O
say O
| | O
and O
so O
the O
chances O
are O
, O
if O
he O
persists O
in O
his O
obstinacy O
, O
he'll O
be O
hung O
. O
That's O
all O
. O
" O
He O
began O
to O
write O
again O
, O
for O
he O
had O
no O
time O
to O
lose O
. O
" O
But O
he O
must O
not O
be O
hung O
, O
" O
said O
Job S-PERSON
, O
with O
vehemence O
. O
Mr. O
Bridgenorth S-PERSON
looked O
up O
, O
smiled O
a O
little O
, O
but O
shook O
his O
head O
. O
" O
What O
did O
he O
say O
, O
sir O
, O
if O
I O
may O
be O
so O
bold O
as O
to O
ask O
? O
" O
continued O
Job O
. O
" O
His O
words O
were O
few O
enough O
, O
and O
he O
was O
so O
reserved O
and O
short O
, O
that O
as O
I O
said O
before O
, O
I O
can O
only O
give O
you O
the O
impression O
they O
conveyed O
to O
me O
. O
I O
told O
him O
of O
course O
who O
I O
was O
, O
and O
for O
what O
I O
was O
sent O
. O
He O
looked O
pleased O
, O
I O
thought O
, O
— O
at O
least O
his O
face O
( O
sad O
enough O
when O
I O
went O
in O
, O
I O
assure O
ye O
) O
brightened O
a O
little O
| | O
but O
he O
said O
he O
had O
nothing O
to O
say O
, O
no O
defence O
to O
make O
. O
I O
asked O
him O
if O
he O
was O
guilty O
, O
then O
| | O
and O
by O
way O
of O
opening O
his O
heart O
I O
said O
I O
understood O
he O
had O
had O
provocation O
enough O
, O
inasmuch O
as O
I O
heard O
that O
the O
girl O
was O
very O
lovely O
, O
and O
had O
jilted O
him O
to O
fall O
desperately O
in O
love O
with O
that O
handsome O
young O
Carson S-PERSON
( O
poor O
fellow O
! O
) O
. O
But O
James B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
did O
not O
speak O
one S-CARDINAL
way O
or O
another O
. O
I O
then O
went O
to O
particulars O
. O
I O
asked O
him O
if O
the O
gun O
was O
his O
, O
as O
his O
mother O
had O
declared O
. O
He O
had O
not O
heard O
of O
her O
admission O
it O
was O
evident O
, O
from O
his O
quick O
way O
of O
looking O
up O
, O
and O
the O
glance O
of O
his O
eye O
| | O
but O
when O
he O
saw O
I O
was O
observing O
him O
, O
he O
hung O
down O
his O
head O
again O
, O
and O
merely O
said O
she O
was O
right O
| | O
it O
was O
his O
gun O
. O
" O
" O
Well O
! O
" O
said O
Job S-PERSON
, O
impatiently O
, O
as O
Mr. O
Bridgenorth S-PERSON
paused O
. O
" O
Nay O
! O
I O
have O
little O
more O
to O
tell O
you O
, O
" O
continued O
that O
gentleman O
. O
" O
I O
asked O
him O
to O
inform O
me O
in O
all O
confidence O
, O
how O
it O
came O
to O
be O
found O
there O
. O
He O
was O
silent O
for O
a O
time O
, O
and O
then O
refused O
. O
Not O
only O
refused O
to O
answer O
that O
question O
, O
but O
candidly O
told O
me O
he O
would O
not O
say O
another O
word O
on O
the O
subject O
, O
and O
, O
thanking O
me O
for O
my O
trouble O
and O
interest O
in O
his O
behalf O
, O
he O
all O
but O
dismissed O
me O
. O
Ungracious O
enough O
on O
the O
whole O
, O
was O
it O
not O
, O
Mr. O
Legh S-PERSON
? O
And O
yet O
, O
I O
assure O
ye O
, O
I O
am O
twenty S-CARDINAL
times O
more O
inclined O
to O
think O
him O
innocent O
than O
before O
I O
had O
the O
interview O
. O
" O
" O
I O
wish O
Mary B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
would O
come O
, O
" O
said O
Job S-PERSON
, O
anxiously O
. O
" O
She O
and O
Will O
are O
a O
long O
time O
about O
it O
. O
" O
" O
Ay O
, O
that's O
our O
only O
chance O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
" O
answered O
Mr. O
Bridgenorth S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
writing O
again O
. O
" O
I O
sent O
Johnson S-PERSON
off O
before O
twelve O
to O
serve O
him O
with O
his O
sub O
- O
pœna O
, O
and O
to O
say O
I O
wanted O
to O
speak O
with O
him O
| | O
he'll O
be O
here O
soon O
, O
I've O
no O
doubt O
. O
" O
There O
was O
a O
pause O
. O
Mr. O
Bridgenorth S-PERSON
looked O
up O
again O
, O
and O
spoke O
. O
" O
Mr. O
Duncombe S-PERSON
promised O
to O
be O
here O
to O
speak O
to O
his O
character O
. O
I O
sent O
him O
a O
subpœna O
on O
Saturday B-TIME
night E-TIME
. O
Though O
after O
all O
, O
juries O
go O
very O
little O
by O
such O
general O
and O
vague O
testimony O
as O
that O
to O
character O
. O
It O
is O
very O
right O
that O
they O
should O
not O
often O
| | O
but O
in O
this O
instance O
unfortunate O
for O
us O
, O
as O
we O
must O
rest O
our O
case O
on O
the O
alibi O
. O
" O
The O
pen O
went O
again O
, O
scratch O
, O
scratch O
over O
the O
paper O
. O
Job O
grew O
very O
fidgetty O
. O
He O
sat O
on O
the O
edge O
of O
his O
chair O
, O
the O
more O
readily O
to O
start O
up O
when O
Will S-PERSON
and O
Mary S-PERSON
should O
appear O
. O
He O
listened O
intently O
to O
every O
noise O
and O
every O
step O
on O
the O
stair O
. O
Once O
he O
heard O
a O
man's O
footstep O
, O
and O
his O
old O
heart O
gave O
a O
leap O
of O
delight O
. O
But O
it O
was O
only O
Mr. O
Bridgenorth's S-PERSON
clerk O
, O
bringing O
him O
a O
list O
of O
those O
cases O
in O
which O
the O
grand O
jury O
had O
found O
true O
bills O
. O
He O
glanced O
it O
over O
and O
pushed O
it O
to O
Job O
, O
merely O
saying O
, O
" O
Of O
course O
we O
expected O
this O
, O
" O
and O
went O
on O
with O
his O
writing O
. O
There O
was O
a O
true O
bill O
against O
James B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
. O
Of O
course O
. O
And O
yet O
Job S-PERSON
felt O
now O
doubly O
anxious O
and O
sad O
. O
It O
seemed O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
end O
. O
He O
had O
got O
, O
by O
imperceptible O
degrees O
, O
to O
think O
Jem S-PERSON
innocent O
. O
Little O
by O
little O
this O
persuasion O
had O
come O
upon O
him O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
( O
tossing O
about O
in O
the O
little O
boat O
on O
the O
broad O
river O
) O
did O
not O
come O
, O
nor O
did O
Will S-PERSON
. O
Job O
grew O
very O
restless O
. O
He O
longed O
to O
go O
and O
watch O
for O
them O
out O
of O
the O
window O
, O
but O
feared O
to O
interrupt O
Mr. O
Bridgenorth S-PERSON
. O
At O
length O
his O
desire O
to O
look O
out O
was O
irresistible O
, O
and O
he O
got O
up O
and O
walked O
carefully O
and O
gently O
across O
the O
room O
, O
his O
boots O
creaking O
at O
every O
cautious O
step O
. O
The O
gloom O
which O
had O
overspread O
the O
sky O
, O
and O
the O
influence O
of O
which O
had O
been O
felt O
by O
Mary S-PERSON
on O
the O
open O
water O
, O
was O
yet O
more O
perceptible O
in O
the O
dark O
, O
dull O
street O
. O
Job O
grew O
more O
and O
more O
fidgetty O
. O
He O
was O
obliged O
to O
walk O
about O
the O
room O
, O
for O
he O
could O
not O
keep O
still O
| | O
and O
he O
did O
so O
, O
regardless O
of O
Mr. O
Bridgenorth's S-PERSON
impatient O
little O
motions O
and O
noises O
, O
as O
the O
slow O
, O
stealthy O
, O
creaking O
movements O
were O
heard O
, O
backwards O
and O
forwards O
, O
behind O
his O
chair O
. O
He O
really O
liked O
Job O
, O
and O
was O
interested O
for O
Jem S-PERSON
, O
else O
his O
nervousness O
would O
have O
overcome O
his O
sympathy O
long O
before O
it O
did O
. O
But O
he O
could O
hold O
out O
no O
longer O
against O
the O
monotonous O
, O
grating O
sound O
| | O
so O
at O
last O
he O
threw O
down O
his O
pen O
, O
locked O
his O
portfolio O
, O
and O
taking O
up O
his O
hat O
and O
gloves O
, O
he O
told O
Job O
he O
must O
go O
to O
the O
courts O
. O
" O
But O
Will B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
is O
not O
come O
, O
" O
said O
Job S-PERSON
, O
in O
dismay O
. O
" O
Just O
wait O
while O
I O
run O
to O
his O
lodgings O
. O
I O
would O
have O
done O
it O
before O
, O
but O
I O
thought O
they'd O
be O
here O
every O
minute O
, O
and O
I O
were O
afraid O
of O
missing O
them O
. O
I'll O
be O
back O
in O
no O
time O
. O
" O
" O
No O
, O
my O
good O
fellow O
, O
I O
really O
must O
go O
. O
Besides O
, O
I O
begin O
to O
think O
Johnson S-PERSON
must O
have O
made O
a O
mistake O
, O
and O
have O
fixed O
with O
this O
William B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
to O
meet O
me O
at O
the O
courts O
. O
If O
you O
like O
to O
wait O
for O
him O
here O
, O
pray O
make O
use O
of O
my O
room O

but O
I've O
a O
notion O
I O
shall O
find O
him O
there O
: O
in O
which O
case O
, O
I'll S-PERSON
send O
him O
to O
your O
lodgings O
| | O
shall O
I O
? O
You O
know O
where O
to O
find O
me O
. O
I O
shall O
be O
here O
again O
by O
eight B-TIME
o'clock E-TIME
, O
and O
with O
the O
evidence O
of O
this O
witness O
that's O
to O
prove O
the O
alibi O
, O
I'll S-PERSON
have O
the O
brief O
drawn O
out O
, O
and O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
counsel O
to O
- O
night O
. O
" O
So O
saying O
he O
shook O
hands O
with O
Job S-PERSON
, O
and O
went O
his O
way O
. O

she O
quietly O
spat O
upon O
her O
fresh O

to O
test O
its O
heat O

then O
went O
on O

Charley S-PERSON
came O
in O

whistling O
with O
an O
air O
of O
indifference O
, O
assumed O
to O
carry O
off O

It O
took O
Job O
some O

understand O
this O

from O
the O
confused O

he O

down O

setting O
her O

The O
lad O
made O
a O
comical O
face O
at O
Job S-ORG

met O
with O
no O

the O

Mrs. O

" O

But O
Charley S-PERSON
was O
sullen O
at O

before O

at O

or O
later O
, O
and O
repent O
sore O
if O
they've O
hanged O
him O
for O
what O
he O
never O
did O
, O
" O
replied O
Job S-PERSON
. O
" O
Ay O
, O
that O
they O
will O
. O
Poor O
souls O
! O
May O
God O
have O
mercy O
on O
them O
when O
they O
find O
out O
their O
mistake O

" O
Presently O
Job O
grew O
tired O
of O
sitting O
waiting O
, O
and O
got O
up O
, O
and O
hung O
about O
the O
door O
and O
window O
, O
like O
some O
animal O
wanting O
to O
go O
out O
. O
It O
was O
pitch O
dark O
, O
for O
the O
moon O
had O
not O
yet O
risen O
. O
" O
You O
just O
go O
to O
bed O
, O
" O
said O
he O
to O
the O
widow O
. O
" O
You'll O
want O
your O
strength O
for O
to O
- O
morrow O
. O
Jem S-PERSON
will O
be O
sadly O
off O
, O
if O
he O
sees O
you O
so O
cut O
up O
as O
you O
look O
to O
- O
night O
. O
I'll O
step O
down O
again O
and O
find O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
She'll O
be O
back O
by O
this O
time O
. O
I'll O
come O
and O
tell O
you O
every O
thing O
, O
never O
fear O
. O
But O
, O
now O
, O
you O
go O
to O
bed O
. O
" O
" O
Thou'rt O
a O
kind O
friend O
, O
Job B-PERSON
Legh E-PERSON
, O
and O
I'll O
go O
, O
as O
thou O
wishest O
me O
. O
But O
, O
oh O
! O
mind O
thou O
com'st O
straight O
off O
to O
me O
, O
and O
bring O
Mary S-PERSON
as O
soon O
as O
thou'st O
lit O
on O
her O
. O
" O
She O
spoke O
low O
, O
but O
very O
calmly O
. O
" O
Ay O
, O
ay O
! O
" O
replied O
Job S-PERSON
, O
slipping O
out O
of O
the O
house O
. O
He O
went O
first S-ORDINAL
to O
Mr. O
Bridgenorth's S-PERSON
, O
where O
it O
had O
struck O
him O
that O
Will S-PERSON
and O
Mary S-PERSON
might O
be O
all O
this O
time O
waiting O
for O
him O
. O
They O
were O
not O
there O
, O
however O
. O
Mr. O
Bridgenorth S-PERSON
had O
just O
come O
in O
, O
and O
Job S-PERSON
went O
breathlessly O
up O
- O
stairs O
to O
consult O
with O
him O
as O
to O
the O
state O
of O
the O
case O
. O
" O
It's O
a O
bad O
job O
, O
" O
said O
the O
lawyer O
, O
looking O
very O
grave O
, O
while O
he O
arranged O
his O
papers O
. O
" O
Johnson S-PERSON
told O
me O
how O
it O
was O
| | O
the O
woman O
that O
Wilson S-PERSON
lodged O
with O
told O
him O
. O
I O
doubt O
it's O
but O
a O
wild O
- O
goose O
chase O
of O
the O
girl O
Barton S-PERSON
. O
Our O
case O
must O
rest O
on O
the O
uncertainty O
of O
circumstantial O
evidence O
, O
and O
the O
goodness O
of O
the O
prisoner's O
previous O
character O
. O
A O
very O
vague O
and O
weak O
defence O
. O
However O
, O
I've S-PERSON
engaged O
Mr. O
Clinton S-PERSON
as O
counsel O
, O
and O
he'll O
make O
the O
best O
of O
it O
. O
And O
now O
, O
my O
good O
fellow O
, O
I O
must O
wish O
you O
good O
- O
night O
, O
and O
turn O
you O
out O
of O
doors O
. O
As O
it O
is O
, O
I O
shall O
have O
to O
sit O
up O
into O
the O
small O
hours O
. O
Did O
you O
see O
my O
clerk O
as O
you O
came O
up O
- O
stairs O
? O
You O
did O
! O
Then O
may O
I O
trouble O
you O
to O
ask O
him O
to O
step O
up O
immediately O
? O
" O
After O
this O
Job O
could O
not O
stay O
, O
and O
, O
making O
his O
humble O
bow O
, O
he O
left O
the O
room O
. O
Then O
he O
went O
to O
Mrs. O
Jones's S-PERSON
. O
She O
was O
in O
, O
but O
Charley S-PERSON
had O
slipped O
off O
again O
. O
There O
was O
no O
holding O
that O
boy O
. O
Nothing O
kept O
him O
but O
lock O
and O
key O
, O
and O
they O
did O
not O
always O
| | O
for O
once O
she O
had O
him O
locked O
up O
in O
the O
garret O
, O
and O
he O
had O
got O
off O
through O
the O
skylight O
. O
Perhaps O
now O
he O
was O
gone O
to O
see O
after O
the O
young O
woman O
down O
at O
the O
docks O
. O
He O
never O
wanted O
an O
excuse O
to O
be O
there O
. O
Unasked O
, O
Job S-PERSON
took O
a O
chair O
, O
resolved O
to O
await O
Charley's S-PERSON
re-appearance O
. O
Mrs. O
Jones S-PERSON
ironed O
and O
folded O
her O
clothes O
, O
talking O
all O
the O
time O
of O
Charley S-PERSON
and O
her O
husband O
, O
who O
was O
a O
sailor O
in O
some O
ship O
bound O
for O
India S-GPE
, O
and O
who O
, O
in O
leaving O
her O
their O
boy O
, O
had O
evidently O
left O
her O
rather O
more O
than O
she O
could O
manage O
. O
She O
moaned O
and O
croaked O
over O
sailors O
, O
and O
sea O
-port O
towns O
, O
and O
stormy O
weather O
, O
and O
sleepless O
nights O
, O
and O
trousers O
all O
over O
tar O
and O
pitch O
, O
long O
after O
Job S-PERSON
had O
left O
off O
attending O
to O
her O
, O
and O
was O
only O
trying O
to O
hearken O
to O
every O
step O
and O
every O
voice O
in O
the O
street O
. O
At O
last O
Charley S-PERSON
came O
in O
, O
but O
he O
came O
alone O
. O
" O
Yon B-PERSON
Mary I-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
has O
getten O
into O
some O
scrape O
or O
another O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
addressing O
himself O
to O
Job O
. O
" O
She's S-PERSON
not O
to O
be O
heard O
of O
at O
any O
of O
the O
piers O

and O
Bourne S-PERSON
says O
it O
were O
a O
boat O
from O
the O
Cheshire S-GPE
side O
as O
she O
went O
aboard O
of O
. O
So O
there's O
no O
hearing O
of O
her O
till O
to O
- O
morrow O
morning O
. O
" O
" O
To O
-morrow O
morning O
she'll O
have O
to O
be O
in O
court O
at O
nine B-TIME
o'clock E-TIME
, O
to O
bear O
witness O
on O
a O
trial O
, O
" O
said O
Job S-PERSON
, O
sorrowfully O
. O
" O
So O
she O
said O
| | O
at O
least O
somewhat O
of O
the O
kind O
, O
" O
said O
Charley S-PERSON
, O
looking O
desirous O
to O
hear O
more O
. O
But O
Job S-PERSON
was O
silent O
. O
He O
could O
not O
think O
of O
any O
thing O
further O
that O
could O
be O
done O
| | O
so O
he O
rose O
up O
, O
and O
, O
thanking O
Mrs. O
Jones S-PERSON
for O
the O
shelter O
she O
had O
given O
him O
, O
he O
went O
out O
into O
the O
street O
| | O
and O
there O
he O
stood O
still O
, O
to O
ponder O
over O
probabilities O
and O
chances O
. O
After O
some O
little O
time O
he O
slowly O
turned O
towards O
the O
lodging O
where O
he O
had O
left O
Mrs. O
Wilson S-PERSON
. O
There O
was O
nothing O
else O
to O
be O
done O
| | O
but O
he O
loitered O
on O
the O
way O
, O
fervently O
hoping O
that O
her O
weariness O
and O
her O
woes O
might O
have O
sent O
her O
to O
sleep O
before O
his O
return O
, O
that O
he O
might O
be O
spared O
her O
questionings O
. O
He O
went O
very O
gently O
into O
the O
house O
- O
place O
where O
the O
sleepy O
landlady O
awaited O
his O
coming O
and O
his O
bringing O
the O
girl O
, O
who O
, O
she O
had O
been O
told O
, O
was O
to O
share O
the O
old O
woman's O
bed O
. O
But O
in O
her O
sleepy O
blindness O
she O
knocked O
things O
so O
about O
in O
lighting O
the O
candle O
( O
she O
could O
see O
to O
have O
a O
nap O
by O
fire O
- O
light O
, O
she O
said O
) O
, O
that O
the O
voice O
of O
Mrs. O
Wilson S-PERSON
was O
heard O
from O
the O
little O
back O
- O
room O
, O
where O
she O
was O
to O
pass O
the O
night O
. O
" O
Who's O
there O
? O
" O
Job O
gave O
no O
answer O
, O
and O
kept O
down O
his O
breath O
, O
that O
she O
might O
think O
herself O
mistaken O
. O
The O
landlady O
, O
having O
no O
such O
care O
, O
dropped O
the O
snuffers O
with O
a O
sharp O
metallic O
sound O
, O
and O
then O
, O
by O
her O
endless O
apologies O
, O
convinced O
the O
listening O
woman O
that O
Job S-PERSON
had O
returned O
. O
" O
Job O
! O
Job O
Legh O
! O
" O
she O
cried O
out O
, O
nervously O
. O
" O
Eh O
, O
dear O
! O
" O
said O
Job S-PERSON
to O
himself O
, O
going O
reluctantly O
to O
her O
bed O
- O
room O
door O
. O
" O
I O
wonder O
if O
one S-CARDINAL
little O
lie O
would O
be O
a O
sin O
as O
things O
stand O
? O
It O
would O
happen O
give O
her O
sleep O
, O
and O
she O
won't O
have O
sleep O
for O
many O
and O
many O
a O
night O
( O
not O

" O
" O
Job O
! O
art O
thou O
there O

" O
asked O
she O
again O
with O
a O
trembling O
impatience O
that O
told O
in O
every O
tone O
of O
her O
voice O

" O
Ay O

sure O

" O
Now O
for O
it O

muttered O
Job S-PERSON
to O
himself O

Then O
in O
a O
louder O
voice O
, O
" O

could O
hear O

in O
an O
instant O
guessed O

when O
he O
heard O
this O

his O
heart O
misgave O
him O

the O
terrible O
revulsion O

the O
short O

what O

he O
do O

" O
Wilson S-PERSON
. O
And O
now O
, O
where O
was O
Mary S-PERSON
? O
How O
Job's S-PERSON
heart O
would O
have O
been O
relieved O
of O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
its O
cares O
if O
he O
could O
have O
seen O
her O
: O
for O
he O
was O
in O
a O
miserable O
state O
of O
anxiety O
about O
her O
| | O
and O
many O
and O
many O
a O
time O
through O
that O
long O
night O
he O
scolded O
her O
and O
himself O
| | O
her O
for O
her O
obstinacy O
, O
and O
himself O
for O
his O
weakness O
in O
yielding O
to O
her O
obstinacy O
, O
when O
she O
insisted O
on O
being O
the O
one O
to O
follow O
and O
find O
out O
Will S-PERSON
. O
She O
did O
not O
pass O
that O
night O
in O
bed O
any O
more O
than O
Job O
| | O
but O
she O
was O
under O
a O
respectable O
roof O
, O
and O
among O
kind O
, O
though O
rough O
people O
. O
She O
had O
offered O
no O
resistance O
to O
the O
old O
boatman O
, O
when O
he O
had O
clutched O
her O
arm O
, O
in O
order O
to O
insure O
her O
following O
him O
, O
as O
he O
threaded O
the O
crowded O
dock O
- O
ways O
, O
and O
dived O
up O
strange O
bye O
- O
streets O
. O
She O
came O
on O
meekly O
after O
him O
, O
scarcely O
thinking O
in O
her O
stupor O
where O
she O
was O
going O
, O
and O
glad O
( O
in O
a O
dead O
, O
heavy O
way O
) O
that O
some O
one O
was O
deciding O
things O
for O
her O
. O
He O
led O
her O
to O
an O
old O
- O
fashioned O
house O
, O
almost O
as O
small O
as O
house O
could O
be O
, O
which O
had O
been O
built O
long O
ago O
, O
before O
all O
the O
other O
part O
of O
the O
street O
, O
and O
had O
a O
country O
- O
town O
look O
about O
it O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
that O
bustling O
back O
street O
. O
He O
pulled O
her O
into O
the O
house O
- O
place O
| | O
and O
relieved O
to O
a O
certain O
degree O
of O
his O
fear O
of O
losing O
her O
on O
the O
way O
, O
he O
exclaimed O
, O
" O
There O
! O
" O
giving O
a O
great O
slap O
of O
one S-CARDINAL
hand O
on O
her O
back O
. O
The O
room O
was O
light O
and O
bright O
, O
and O
roused O
Mary S-PERSON
( O
perhaps O
the O
slap O
on O
her O
back O
might O
help O
a O
little O
, O
too O
) O
, O
and O
she O
felt O
the O
awkwardness O
of O
accounting O
for O
her O
presence O
to O
a O
little O
bustling O
old O
woman O
who O
had O
been O
moving O
about O
the O
fire O
- O
place O
on O
her O
entrance O
. O
The O
boatman O
took O
it O
very O
quietly O
, O
never O
deigning O
to O
give O
any O
explanation O
, O
but O
sitting O
down O
in O
his O
own O
particular O
chair O
, O
and O
chewing O
tobacco O
, O
while O
he O
looked O
at O
Mary S-PERSON
with O
the O
most O
satisfied O
air O
imaginable O
, O
half O
triumphantly O
, O
as O
if O
she O
were O
the O
captive O
of O
his O
bow O
and O
spear O
, O
and O
half O
defyingly O
, O
as O
if O
daring O
her O
to O
escape O
. O
The O
old O
woman O
, O
his O
wife O
, O
stood O
still O
, O
poker O
in O
hand O
, O
waiting O
to O
be O
told O
who O
it O
was O
that O
her O
husband O
had O
brought O
home O
so O
unceremoniously O
| | O
but O
, O
as O
she O
looked O
in O
amazement O
the O
girl's O
cheek O
flushed O
, O
and O
then O
blanched O
to O
a O
dead O
whiteness O
| | O
a O
film O
came O
over O
her O
eyes O
, O
and O
catching O
at O
the O
dresser O
for O
support O
in O
that O
hot O
whirling O
room O
, O
she O
fell O
in O
a O
heap O
on O
the O
floor O
. O
Both O
man O
and O
wife O
came O
quickly O
to O
her O
assistance O
. O
They O
raised O
her O
up O
, O
still O
insensible O
, O
and O
he O
supported O
her O
on O
one S-CARDINAL
knee O
, O
while O
his O
wife O
pattered O
away O
for O
some O
cold O
fresh O
water O
. O
She O
threw O
it O
straight O
over O
Mary S-PERSON

but O
though O
it O
caused O
a O
great O
sob O
, O
the O
eyes O
still O
remained O
closed O
, O
and O
the O
face O
as O
pale O
as O
ashes O
. O
" O
Who O
is O
she O
, O
Ben S-PERSON
? O
" O
asked O
the O
woman O
, O
as O
she O
rubbed O
her O
unresisting O
, O
powerless O
hands O
. O
" O
How O
should O
I O
know O
? O
" O
answered O
her O
husband O
gruffly O
. O
" O

a O
- O
well O
! O
" O
( O
in O
a O
soothing O
tone O

herself O

thought O
you O
might O

you O
know O

as O
you O
brought O
her O
home O
. O
Poor O
thing O
! O
we O
must O
not O
ask O
aught O
about O
her O
, O
but O
that O
she O
needs O
help O
. O
I O
wish O
I'd O
my O
salts O
at O
home O
, O
but O
I O
lent O
'em O
to O
Mrs. O
Burton S-PERSON
, O
last B-DATE
Sunday E-DATE
in O
church O
, O
for O
she O
could O
not O
keep O
awake O
through O
the O
sermon O
. O

a O

me O
, O
how O
white O
she O
is O
! O
" O
" O
Here O
! O
you O
hold O
her O
up O
a O
bit O
, O
" O
said O
her O
husband O
. O
She O
did O
as O
he O
desired O
, O
still O
crooning O
to O
herself O
, O
not O
caring O
for O
his O
short O
, O
sharp O
interruptions O
as O
she O
went O
on O
| | O
and O
, O
indeed O
, O
to O
her O
old O
, O
loving O
heart O
, O
his O
crossest O
words O
fell O
like O
pearls O
and O
diamonds O
, O
for O
he O
had O
been O
the O
husband O
of O
her O
youth O

and O
even O
he O
, O
rough O
and O
crabbed O
as O
he O
was O
, O
was O
secretly O
soothed O
by O
the O
sound O
of O
her O
voice O
, O
although O
not O
for O
worlds O
, O
if O
he O
could O
have O
helped O
it O

would O
he O
have O
shown O
any O
of O
the O
love O

was O
hidden O
beneath O
his O
rough O
outside O

" O
What's O
the O
old O
fellow O
after O
? O
" O
said O
she O
, O
bending O
over O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
so O
as O
to O
accommodate O
the O
drooping O
head O

square O
bottle O
of O

labelled O

the O

that O
I O
do O
. O
" O
Mary S-PERSON
had O
listened O
feebly O
to O
this O
soliloquy O
, O
and O
now O
tried O
to O
satisfy O
her O
hostess O
in O
weak O
, O
broken O
sentences O
. O
" O
I'm O
not O
a O
bad O
one O
, O
missis O
, O
indeed O
. O
Your O
master O
took O
me O
out O
to O
sea O
after O
a O
ship O
as O
had O
sailed O
. O
There O
was O
a O
man O
in O
it O
as O
might O
save O
a O
life O
at O
the O
trial O
to O
- O
morrow O
. O
The O
captain O
would O
not O
let O
him O
come O
, O
but O
he O
says O
he'll O
come O
back O
in O
the O
pilot O
- O
boat O
. O
" O
She O
fell O
to O
sobbing O
at O
the O
thought O
of O
her O
waning O
hopes O
, O
and O
the O
old O
woman O
tried O
to O
comfort O
her O
, O
beginning O
with O
her O
accustomed O
, O
" O
Well O
- O
a O
- O
well O
! O
and O
he'll O
come O
back O
, O
I'm O
sure O
. O
I O
know O
he O
will O
| | O
so O
keep O
up O
your O
heart O
. O
Don't S-PERSON
fret O
about O
it O
. O
He's O
sure O
to O
be O
back O
. O
" O
" O
Oh O
! O
I'm O
afraid O
! O
I'm O
sore O
afraid O
he O
won't O
, O
" O
cried O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
consoled O
, O
nevertheless O
, O
by O
the O
woman's O
assertions O
, O
all O
groundless O
as O
she O
knew O
them O
to O
be O
. O
Still O
talking O
half O
to O
herself O
and O
half O
to O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
the O
old O
woman O
prepared O
tea O
, O
and O
urged O
her O
visitor O
to O
eat O
and O
refresh O
herself O
. O
But O
Mary S-PERSON
shook O
her O
head O
at O
the O
proffered O
food O
, O
and O
only O
drank O
a O
cup O
of O
tea O
with O
thirsty O
eagerness O
. O
For O
the O
spirits O
had O
thrown O
her O
into O
a O
burning O
heat O
, O
and O
rendered O
each O
impression O
received O
through O
her O
senses O
of O
the O
most O
painful O
distinctness O
and O
intensity O
, O
while O
her O
head O
ached O
in O
a O
terrible O
manner O
. O
She O
disliked O
speaking O
, O
her O
power O
over O
her O
words O
seemed O
so O
utterly O
gone O
. O
She O
used O
quite O
different O
expressions O
to O
those O
she O
intended O
. O
So O
she O
kept O
silent O
, O
while O
Mrs. O
Sturgis S-PERSON
( O
for O
that O
was O
the O
name O
of O
her O
hostess O
) O
talked O
away O
, O
and O
put O
her O
tea-things O
by O
, O
and O
moved O
about O
incessantly O
, O
in O
a O
manner O
that O
increased O
the O
dizziness O
in O
Mary's S-PERSON
head O
. O
She O
felt O
as O
if O
she O
ought O
to O
take O
leave O
for O
the O
night O
and O
go O
. O
But O
where O
? O
Presently O
the O
old O
man O
came O
back O
, O
crosser O
and O
gruffer O
than O
when O
he O
went O
away O
. O
He O
kicked O
aside O
the O
dry O
shoes O
his O
wife O
had O
prepared O
for O
him O
, O
and O
snarled O
at O
all O
she O
said O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
attributed O
this O
to O
his O
finding O
her O
still O
there O
, O
and O
gathered O
up O
her O
strength O
for O
an O
effort O
to O
leave O
the O
house O
. O
But O
she O
was O
mistaken O
. O
By O
- O
and O
- O
bye O
, O
he O
said O
( O
looking O
right O
into O
the O
fire O
, O
as O
if O
addressing O
it O
) O
, O
" O

" O
" O
Ay O
, O
ay O
, O
and O
is O
it O
so O
? O
" O
said O
his O
wife O
, O
who O
, O
knowing O
him O
well O
, O
knew O
that O
his O
surliness O
proceeded O
from O
some O
repressed O
sympathy O
. O
" O
Well O

" O
She O
looked O
out O
of O
their O
little O
window O
at O
a O
weather O
- O
cock O
, O
near O
, O
glittering O
in O
the O
moonlight O
| | O
and O
as O
she O
was O
a O
sailor's O
wife O
, O
she O
instantly O
recognised O
the O
unfavourable O
point O
at O
which O
the O
indicator O
seemed O
stationary O
, O
and O
giving O
a O
heavy O
sigh O
, O
turned O
into O
the O
room O
, O
and O
began O
to O
beat O
about O
in O
her O
own O
mind O
for O
some O
other O
mode O
of O
comfort O
. O
" O
There's O
no O
one O
else O
who O
can O
prove O
what O
you O
want O
at O
the O
trial O
to O
- O
morrow O
, O
is O
there O
? O
" O
asked O
she O
. O
" O
No O
one O
! O
" O
answered O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
" O
And O
you've O
no O
clue O
to O
the O
one O
as O
is O
really O
guilty O

if O
t'other O
is O
not O

" O
Mary S-PERSON
did O
not O
answer O
, O
but O
trembled O
all O
over O
. O
Sturgis S-PERSON
saw O
it O
. O
" O
Don't O
bother O
her O
with O
thy O
questions O
, O
" O
said O
he O
to O
his O

" O

" O
Mary S-PERSON
went O
up O
- O
stairs O
murmuring O
thanks O
and O
blessings O
on O
those O
who O
took O
the O
stranger O
in O
. O
Mrs. O
Sturgis S-PERSON
led O
her O
into O
a O
little O
room O
redolent O
of O
the O
sea O
and O
foreign O
lands O
. O
There O
was O
a O
small O
bed O
for O
one S-CARDINAL
son O
, O
bound O
for O
China S-GPE
| | O
and O
a O
hammock O
slung O
above O
for O
another O
, O
who O
was O
now O
tossing O
in O
the O
Baltic S-LOC
. O
The O
sheets O
looked O
made O
out O
of O
sail O
- O
cloth O
, O
but O
were O
fresh O
and O
clean O
in O
spite O
of O
their O
brownness O
. O
Against O
the O
wall O
were O
wafered O
two S-CARDINAL
rough O
drawings O
of O
vessels O
with O
their O
names O
written O
underneath O
, O
on O
which O
the O
mother's O
eyes O
caught O
, O
and O
gazed O
until O
they O
filled O
with O
tears O
. O
But O
she O
brushed O
the O
drops O
away O
with O
the O
back O
of O
her O
hand O
, O
and O
in O
a O
cheerful O
tone O
went O
on O
to O
assure O
Mary S-PERSON
the O
bed O
was O
well O
aired O
. O
" O
I O
cannot O
sleep O

you O

I O

said O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
sinking O
down O
on O
the O
window O
- O
seat O

" O
Come O

now O

" O
said O
Mrs. O
Sturgis S-PERSON
, O
" O

My O

many O
a O

away O

work O
away O

pleaded O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
as O
her O
hostess O
seemed O
so O
resolute O
about O
seeing O
her O
to O
bed O

Her O
looks O
won O
her O
suit O

" O

And O
quietly O
, O
noiselessly O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
watched O
the O
unchanging O
weather O

through O
the O

sat O
on O

her O
eyes O
burning O

stiff O
with O
the O
intensity O
of O
her O
gaze O

The O
ruddy O
morning O
stole O
up O
the O
horizon O
, O
casting O
a O
crimson O
glow O
into O
the O
watcher's O

the O
poor O

perhaps O

this O

At O
nine B-TIME
o'clock E-TIME
they O
all O
met O
at O
their O
awful O
place O

The O

the O
prisoner O

all O
were O
gathered O
together O
within O

And O
besides O
these O
were O
many O

Job B-PERSON
Legh E-PERSON
, O
Ben B-PERSON
Sturgis E-PERSON
, O
and O
several O
others O
were O
there O
, O
amongst O
whom O
was O
Charley B-PERSON
Jones E-PERSON
. O
Job B-PERSON
Legh E-PERSON
had O
carefully O
avoided O
any O
questioning O
from O
Mrs. O
Wilson S-PERSON
that O
morning O
. O
Indeed O
he O
had O
not O
been O
much O
in O
her O
company O
, O
for O
he O
had O
risen O
up O
early O
to O
go O
out O
once O
more O
to O
make O
inquiry O
for O
Mary S-PERSON
| | O
and O
when O
he O
could O
hear O
nothing O
of O
her O
, O
he O
had O
desperately O
resolved O
not O
to O
undeceive O
Mrs. O
Wilson S-PERSON
, O
as O
sorrow O
never O
came O
too O
late O
| | O
and O
if O
the O
blow O
were O
inevitable O
, O
it O
would O
be O
better O
to O
leave O
her O
in O
ignorance O
of O
the O
impending O
evil O
as O
long O
as O
possible O
. O
She O
took O
her O
place O
in O
the O
witness O
- O
room O
, O
worn O
and O
dispirited O
, O
but O
not O
anxious O
. O
As O
Job S-PERSON
struggled O
through O
the O
crowd O
into O
the O
body O
of O
the O
court O
, O
Mr. O
Bridgenorth's S-PERSON
clerk O
beckoned O
to O
him O
. O
" O
Here's O
a O
letter O
for O
you O
from O
our O
client O
! O
" O
Job O
sickened O
as O
he O
took O
it O
. O
He O
did O
not O
know O
why O
, O
but O
he O
dreaded O
a O
confession O
of O
guilt O
, O
which O
would O
be O
an O
overthrow O
of O
all O
hope O
. O
The O
letter O
ran O
as O
follows O
. O
Dear O
Friend S-PERSON
, O
— O
I O
thank O
you O
heartily O
for O
your O
goodness O
in O
finding O
me O
a O
lawyer O
, O
but O
lawyers O
can O
do O
no O
good O
to O
me O
, O
whatever O
they O
may O
do O
to O
other O
people O
. O
But O
I O
am O
not O
the O
less O
obliged O
to O
you O
, O
dear O
friend O
. O
I O
foresee O
things O
will O
go O
against O
me O
— O
and O
no O
wonder O
. O
If O
I O
was O
a O
jury O
- O
man O
, O
I O
should O
say O
the O
man O
was O
guilty O
as O
had O
as O
much O
evidence O
brought O
against O
him O
as O
may O
be O
brought O
against O
me O
to O
- O
morrow O
. O
So O
it's O
no O
blame O
to O
them O
if O
they O
do O
. O
But O
, O
Job B-PERSON
Legh E-PERSON
, O
I O
think O
I O
need O
not O
tell O
you O
I O
am O
as O
guiltless O
in O
this O
matter O
as O
the O
babe O
unborn O
, O
although O
it O
is O
not O
in O
my O
power O
to O
prove O
it O
. O
If O
I O
did O
not O
believe O
that O
you O
thought O
me O
innocent O
, O
I O
could O
not O
write O
as O
I O
do O
now O
to O
tell O
you O
my O
wishes O
. O
You'll O
not O
forget O
they O
are O
the O
wishes O
of O
a O
man O
shortly O
to O
die O
. O
Dear O
friend O
, O
you O
must O
take O
care O
of O
my O
mother O
. O
Not O
in O
the O
money O
way O
, O
for O
she O
will O
have O
enough O
for O
her O
and O
Aunt B-PERSON
Alice E-PERSON
| | O
but O
you O
must O
let O
her O
talk O
to O
you O
of O
me O
| | O
and O
show O
her O
that O
( O
whatever O
others O
may O
do O
) O
you O
think O
I O
died O
innocent O
. O
I O
don't O
reckon O
she O
will O
stay O
long O
behind O
when O
we O
are O
all O
gone O
. O
Be O
tender O
with O
her O
, O
Job O
, O
for O
my O
sake O
| | O
and O
if O
she O
is O
a O
bit O
fractious O
at O
times O
, O
remember O
what O
she O
has O
gone O
through O
. O
I O
know O
mother O
will O
never O
doubt O
me O
, O
God O
bless O
her O
. O
There O
is O
one S-CARDINAL
other O
whom O
I O
fear O
I O
have O
loved O
too O
dearly O
| | O
and O
yet O
, O
the O
loving O
her O
has O
made O
the O
happiness O
of O
my O
life O
. O
She O
will O
think O
I O
have O
murdered O
her O
lover O
| | O
she O
will O
think O
I O
have O
caused O
the O
grief O
she O
must O
be O
feeling O
. O
And O
she O
must O
go O
on O
thinking O
so O
. O
It O
is O
hard O
upon O
me O
to O
say O
this O
| | O
but O
she O
must O
. O
It O
will O
be O
best O
for O
her O
, O
and O
that's O
all O
I O
ought O
to O
think O
on O
. O
But O
, O
dear O
Job S-PERSON
, O
you O
are O
a O
hearty O
fellow O
for O
your O
time O
of O
life O
, O
and O
may O
live O
a B-DATE
many I-DATE
years E-DATE
to O
come O
| | O
and O
perhaps O
you O
could O
tell O
her O
, O
when O
you O
felt O
sure O
you O
were O
drawing O
near O
your O
end O
, O
that O
I O
solemnly O
told O
you O
( O
as O
I O
do O
now O
) O
that O
I O
was O
innocent O
of O
this O
thing O
. O
You O
must O
not O
tell O
her O
for O
many O
years O
to O
come O
| | O
but O
I O
cannot O
well O
bear O
to O
think O
on O
her O
living O
through O
a O
long O
life O
, O
and O
hating O
the O
thought O
of O
me O
as O
the O
murderer O
of O
him O
she O
loved O
, O
and O
dying O
with O
that O
hatred O
to O
me O
in O
her O
heart O
. O
It O
would O
hurt O
me O
sore O
in O
the O
other O
world O
to O
see O
the O
look O
of O
it O
in O
her O
face O
, O
as O
it O
would O
be O
, O
till O
she O
was O
told O
. O
I O
must O
not O
let O
myself O
think O
on O
how O
she O
must O
be O
viewing O
me O
now O
. O
So O
God O
bless O
you O

no O

Job O
turned O
the O
letter O
over O
and O
over O
when O
he O
had O
read O
it O
| | O
sighed O
deeply O
| | O
and O
then O
wrapping O
it O
carefully O
up O
in O
a O
bit O
of O
newspaper O
he O
had O
about O
him O
, O
he O
put O
it O
in O
his O
waistcoat O
pocket O
, O
and O
went O
off O
to O
the O
door O
of O
the O
witness O
- O
room O
to O
ask O
if O
Mary B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
were O
there O
. O
As O
the O
door O
opened O
he O
saw O
her O
sitting O
within O
, O
against O
a O
table O
on O
which O
her O
folded O
arms O
were O
resting O
, O
and O
her O
head O
was O
hidden O
within O
them O
. O
It O
was O
an O
attitude O
of O
hopelessness O
, O
and O
would O
have O
served O
to O
strike O
Job O
dumb O
in O
sickness O
of O
heart O
, O
even O
without O
the O
sound O
of O
Mrs. O
Wilson's S-PERSON
voice O
in O
passionate O
sobbing O
, O
and O
sore O
lamentations O
, O
which O
told O
him O
as O
well O
as O
words O
could O
do O
( O
for O
she O
was O
not O
within O
view O
of O
the O
door O
, O
and O
he O
did O
not O
care O
to O
go O
in O
) O
, O
that O
she O
was O
at O
any O
rate O
partially O
undeceived O
as O
to O
the O
hopes O
he O
had O
given O
her O
last B-TIME
night E-TIME

Sorrowfully O
did O
Job O
return O

As O
soon O

could O
bring O
his O
distracted O
thoughts O
to O
bear O
upon O
the O
present O
scene O

perceived O

the O
trial O
of O
James B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON

the O
murder O
of O
Henry B-PERSON
Carson E-PERSON

just O

gabbling O
over O
the O
indictment O

in O
a B-TIME
minute E-TIME

two S-CARDINAL

was O
the O

question O

" O

Guilty O

was O
expected O

— O
was O
customary O
in O
all O
cases O

— O
there O
was O
a O
pause O
of O
dead O
silence O

an O
interval O
of O
solemnity O
even O
in O
this O
hackneyed O
part O
of O
the O
proceeding O

the O
prisoner O
at O

outward O

with O
far O
other O

different O
scenes O
presented O
to O
his O
mental O
vision O

a O
sort O
of O
rapid O
recapitulation O
of O
his O
life O

remembrances O
of O
his O
childhood O

sure O

secure O

he O
started O
from O
his O
instant's O
pause O

said O
in O
a O
low O
firm O

some O
little O
buzz O
of O
conversation O
going O
on O
among O
the O
people O
while O
the O
leading O

try O
to O
trace O
in O
the O

some O
expression O

it O
would O
have O
been O

better O
if O
the O
prison O
barber O

cut O
his O
hair O
a O
little O
previous O

the O

as O

down O

nothing O

" O
Poor O
Jem S-PERSON

His O
raven O
hair O

his O

pride O

) O
, O
was O
that O
too O

have O
its O
influence O
against O
him O
? O
The O
witnesses O
were O
called O
. O
At O
first S-ORDINAL
they O
consisted O
principally O
of O
policemen O

who O
, O
being O
much O
accustomed O
to O
giving O
evidence O
, O
knew O
what O
were O
the O
material O
points O
they O
were O
called O
on O
to O
prove O
, O
and O
did O
not O
lose O
the O
time O
of O
the O
court O
in O
listening O
to O
any O
thing O
unnecessary O
. O
" O
Clear O
as O
day O
against O
the O
prisoner O
, O
" O
whispered O
one S-CARDINAL
attorney's O
clerk O
to O
another O
. O
" O
Black O
as O
night O
, O
you O
mean O
, O
" O
replied O
his O
friend O

and O
they O
both O
smiled O
. O
" O
Jane B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
! O
who's O
she O
? O
some O
relation O

" O
" O
The O

" O
" O
Oh O

ay O

I O
remember O
! O
Rather O
hard O
on O
her O

too O
, O
I O
think O

" O
Then O
both O
were O
silent O
, O
as O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
officers O
of O
the O
court O
ushered O
Mrs. O
Wilson S-PERSON
into O
the O
witness O

box O
. O
I O
have O
often O
called O
her O
" O
the O
old O
woman O
, O
" O
and O
" O
an O
old O
woman O
, O
" O
because O
, O
in O
truth O
, O
her O
appearance O
was O
so O
much O
beyond O
her O
years S-DATE
, O
which O
might O
not O
be O
many O
above O
fifty S-CARDINAL
. O
But O
partly O
owing O
to O
her O
accident O
in O
early O
life O
, O
which O
left O
a O
stamp O
of O
pain O
upon O
her O
face O
, O
partly O
owing O
to O
her O
anxious O
temper O
, O
partly O
to O
her O
sorrows O
, O
and O
partly O
to O
her O
limping O
gait O
, O
she O
always O
gave O
me O
the O
idea O
of O
age O
. O
But O
now O
she O
might O
have O
seemed O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
seventy E-CARDINAL

her O
lines O
were O
so O
set O
and O
deep O
, O
her O
features O
so O
sharpened O
, O
and O
her O
walk O
so O
feeble O
. O
She O
was O
trying O
to O
check O
her O
sobs O
into O
composure O
, O
and O
( O
unconsciously O
) O
was O
striving O
to O
behave O
as O
she O
thought O
would O
best O
please O
her O
poor O
boy O
, O
whom O
she O
knew O
she O
had O
often O
grieved O
by O
her O
uncontrolled O
impatience O
. O
He O
had O
buried O
his O
face O
in O
his O
arms O
, O
which O
rested O
on O
the O
front O
of O
the O
dock O
( O
an O
attitude O
he O
retained O
during O
the O
greater O
part O
of O
his O
trial O
, O
and O
which O
prejudiced O
many O
against O
him O
) O
. O
The O
counsel O
began O
the O
examination O
. O
" O
Your O
name O
is O
Jane B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
, O
I O
believe O

" O
" O
Yes O
, O
sir O

" O
" O
The O
mother O
of O

prisoner O
at O
the O
bar O
? O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
sir O

" O
with O
quivering O
voice O
, O
ready O
to O
break O
out O
into O
weeping O
, O
but O
earning O
respect O
by O
the O
strong O
effort O
at O
self O
- O
control O
, O
prompted O
, O
as O
I O
have O
said O
before O
, O
by O
her O
earnest O
wish O
to O
please O
her O
son O
by O
her O
behaviour O
. O
The O
barrister O
now O
proceeded O
to O
the O
important O
part O
of O
the O
examination O
, O
tending O
to O
prove O
that O
the O
gun O
found O
on O
the O
scene O
of O
the O
murder O
was O
the O
prisoner's O
. O
She O
had O
committed O
herself O
so O
fully O
to O
the O
policeman O
, O
that O
she O
could O
not O
well O
retract O

so O
without O
much O
delay O
in O
bringing O
the O
question O
round O
to O
the O
desired O
point O
, O
the O
gun O
was O
produced O
in O
court O
, O
and O
the O
inquiry O
made O
— O
" O
That O
gun O
belongs O
to O
your O
son O
, O
does O
it O
not O
? O
" O
She O
clenched O
the O
sides O
of O
the O
witness O
- O
box O
in O
her O
efforts O
to O
make O
her O
parched O
tongue O
utter O
words O
. O
At O
last O
she O
moaned O
forth O
, O
" O
Oh O
! O
Jem O
, O
Jem S-PERSON
! O
what O
mun O
I O
say O
? O
" O
Every O
one O
bent O
forward O
to O
hear O
the O
prisoner's O
answer O
| | O
although O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
it O
was O
of O
little O
importance O
to O
the O
issue O
of O
the O
trial O
. O
He O
lifted O
up O
his O
head O
| | O
and O
with O
a O
face O
brimming O
full O
of O
pity O
for O
his O
mother O
, O
yet O
resolved O
into O
endurance O
, O
said O
, O
" O
Tell O
the O
truth O
, O
mother O
! O
" O
And O
so O
she O
did O
, O
with O
the O
fidelity O
of O
a O
little O
child O
. O
Every O
one O
felt O
that O
she O
did O
| | O
and O
the O
little O
colloquy O
between O
mother O
and O
son O
did O
them O
some O
slight O
service O
in O
the O
opinion O
of O
the O
audience O
. O
But O
the O
awful O
judge O
sat O
unmoved O
| | O
and O
the O
jurymen O
changed O
not O
a O
muscle O
of O
their O
countenances O
| | O
while O
the O
counsel O
for O
the O
prosecution O
went O
triumphantly O
through O
this O
part O
of O
the O
case O
, O
including O
the O
fact O
of O
Jem's S-PERSON
absence O
from O
home O
on O
the B-TIME
night E-TIME
of O
the O
murder O
, O
and O
bringing O
every O
admission O
to O
bear O
right O
against O
the O
prisoner O
. O
It O
was O
over O
. O
She O
was O
told O
to O
go O
down O
. O
But O
she O
could O
no O
longer O
compel O
her O
mother's O
heart O
to O
keep O
silence O
, O
and O
suddenly O
turning O
towards O
the O
judge O
( O
with O
whom O
she O
imagined O
the O
verdict O
to O
rest O
) O
, O
she O
thus O
addressed O
him O
with O
her O
choking O
voice O
. O
" O
And O
now O
, O
sir O
, O
I've O
telled O
you O
the O
truth O

the O
whole O
truth O

he O
bid O
me O

don't O
ye O
let O
what O
I O
have O
said O

hang O
him O

my O
lord O
judge O

take O
my O
word O

as O
innocent O
as O
the O
child O

For O
sure O

am O
his O
mother O
, O

have O
nursed O
him O
on O
my O
knee O

and O
been O
gladdened O
by O
the O
sight O
of O
him O
every O
day O
since O
, O
ought O
to O
know O
him O
better O
than O
yon O
pack O
of O
fellows O
" O
( O
indicating O
the O
jury O
, O
while O
she O
strove O
against O
her O
heart O
to O
render O
her O
words O
distinct O
and O
clear O
for O
her O
dear O
son's O
sake O

My O
lord O

so O
good O
I O
often O
wondered O
what O
harm O
there O
was O
in O
him O

many O
is O
the O
time O
when O
I've O
been O
fretted O
( O
for O
I'm O
frabbit O
enough O
at O
times O

, O
when O
I've O
scold't O
myself O

said O

— O
if O

is O
— O
taken O
from O
me O

shall O
be O
a O

" O
While O
sobbing O
out O
these O
words O
she O
was O
led O
away O
by O
the O
officers O
of O
the O
court O
, O
but O
tenderly O
, O
and O
reverently O
, O
with O
the O
respect O
which O
great O
sorrow O
commands O
. O
The O
stream O
of O
evidence O
went O
on O
and O
on O
, O
gathering O
fresh O
force O
from O
every O
witness O
who O
was O
examined O
, O
and O
threatening O
to O
overwhelm O
poor O
Jem S-PERSON
. O
Already O
they O
had O
proved O
that O
the O
gun O
was O
his O
, O
that O
he O
had O
been O
heard O
not O
many O
days O
before O
the O
commission O
of O
the O
deed O
to O
threaten O
the O
deceased O

indeed O
, O
that O
the O
police O
had O
, O
at O
that O
time O
, O
been O
obliged O
to O
interfere O
to O
prevent O
some O
probable O
act O
of O
violence O
. O
It O
only O
remained O
to O
bring O
forward O
a O
sufficient O
motive O
for O
the O
threat O
and O
the O
murder O
. O
The O
clue O
to O
this O
had O
been O
furnished O
by O
the O
policeman O
, O
who O
had O
overheard O
Jem's S-PERSON
angry O
language O
to O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
| | O
and O
his O
report O
in O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
instance O
had O
occasioned O
the O
subpœna O
to O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
And O
now O
she O
was O
to O
be O
called O
on O
to O
bear O
witness O
. O
The O
court O
was O
by O
this O
time O
almost O
as O
full O
as O
it O
could O
hold O
| | O
but O
fresh O
attempts O
were O
being O
made O
to O
squeeze O
in O
at O
all O
the O
entrances O
, O
for O
many O
were O
anxious O
to O
see O
and O
hear O
this O
part O
of O
the O
trial O
. O
Old O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
felt O
an O
additional O
beat O
at O
his O
heart O
at O
the O
thought O
of O
seeing O
the O
fatal O
Helen S-PERSON
, O
the O
cause O
of O
all O
— O
a O
kind O
of O
interest O
and O
yet O
repugnance O
, O
for O
was O
not O
she O
beloved O
by O
the O
dead O
| | O
nay O
, O
perhaps O
in O
her O
way O
, O
loving O
and O
mourning O
for O
the O
same O
being O
that O
he O
himself O
was O
so O
bitterly O
grieving O
over O
? O
And O
yet O
he O
felt O
as O
if O
he O
abhorred O
her O
and O
her O
rumoured O
loveliness O
, O
as O
if O
she O
were O
the O
curse O
against O
him O
| | O
and O
he O
grew O
jealous O
of O
the O
love O
with O
which O
she O
had O
inspired O
his O
son O
, O
and O
would O
fain O
have O
deprived O
her O
of O
even O
her O
natural O
right O
of O
sorrowing O
over O
her O
lover's O
untimely O
end O
: O
for O
you O
see O
it O
was O
a O
fixed O
idea O
in O
the O
minds O
of O
all O
, O
that O
the O
handsome O
, O
bright O
, O
gay O
, O
rich O
young O
gentleman O
must O
have O
been O
beloved O
in O
preference O
to O
the O
serious O
, O
almost O
stern O
- O
looking O
smith O
, O
who O
had O
to O
toil O
for O
his O
daily O
bread O
. O
Hitherto O
the O
effect O
of O
the O
trial O
had O
equalled O
Mr. O
Carson's S-PERSON
most O
sanguine O
hopes O
, O
and O
a O
severe O
look O
of O
satisfaction O
came O
over O
the O
face O
of O
the O
avenger O
, O
— O
over O
that O
countenance O
whence O
the O
smile O
had O
departed O
, O
never O
more O
to O
return O
. O
All O
eyes O
were O
directed O
to O
the O
door O
through O
which O
the O
witnesses O
entered O
. O
Even O
Jem S-PERSON
looked O
up O
to O
catch O
one S-CARDINAL
glimpse O
before O
he O
hid O
his O
face O
from O
her O
look O
of O
aversion O
. O
The O
officer O
had O
gone O
to O
fetch O
her O
. O
She O
was O
in O
exactly O
the O
same O
attitude O
as O
when O
Job B-PERSON
Legh E-PERSON
had O
seen O
her O
two B-TIME
hours E-TIME
before O
through O
the O
half O
- O
open O
door O
. O
Not O
a O
finger O
had O
moved O
. O
The O
officer O
summoned O
her O
, O
but O
she O
did O
not O
stir O
. O
She O
was O
so O
still O
he O
thought O
she O
had O
fallen O
asleep O
, O
and O
he O
stepped O
forward O
and O
touched O
her O
. O
She O
started O
up O
in O
an O
instant O
, O
and O
followed O
him O
with O
a O
kind O
of O
rushing O
rapid O
motion O
into O
the O
court O
, O
into O
the O
witness O
- O
box O
. O
And O
amid O
all O
that O
sea O
of O
faces O
, O
misty O
and O
swimming O
before O
her O
eyes O
, O
she O
saw O
but O
two S-CARDINAL
clear O
bright O
spots O
, O
distinct O
and O
fixed O
: O
the O
judge O
, O
who O
might O
have O
to O
condemn O
| | O
and O
the O
prisoner O
, O
who O
might O
have O
to O
die O
. O
The O
mellow O
sunlight O
streamed O
down O
that O
high O
window O
on O
her O
head O
, O
and O
fell O
on O
the O
rich O
treasure O
of O
her O
golden O
hair O
, O
stuffed O
away O
in O
masses O
under O
her O
little O
bonnet O
- O
cap O
| | O
and O
in O
those O
warm O
beams O
the O
motes O
kept O
dancing O
up O
and O
down O
. O
The O
wind O
had O
changed O
— O
had O
changed O
almost O
as O
soon O
as O
she O
had O
given O
up O
her O
watching O
| | O
the O
wind O
had O
changed O
, O
and O
she O
heeded O
it O
not O
. O
Many O
who O
were O
looking O
for O
mere O
flesh O
and O
blood O
beauty O
, O
mere O
colouring O
, O
were O
disappointed O
| | O
for O
her O
face O
was O
deadly O
white O
, O
and O
almost O
set O
in O
its O
expression O
, O
while O
a O
mournful O
bewildered O
soul O
looked O
out O
of O
the O
depths O
of O
those O
soft O
, O
deep O
, O
gray O
eyes O
. O
But O
others O
recognised O
a O
higher O
and O
stranger O
kind O
of O
beauty O
| | O
one O
that O
would O
keep O
its O
hold O
on O
the O
memory O
for O
many O
after O
years S-DATE
. O
I O
was O
not O
there O
myself O
| | O
but O
one O
who O
was O
, O
told O
me O
that O
her O
look O
, O
and O
indeed O
her O
whole O
face O
, O
was O
more O
like O
the O
well O
- O
known O
engraving O
from O
Guido's S-PERSON
picture O
of O
" O
Beatrice B-PERSON
Cenci E-PERSON
" O
than O
any O
thing O
else O
he O
could O
give O
me O
an O
idea O
of O
. O
He O
added O
, O
that O
her O
countenance O
haunted O
him O
, O
like O
the O
remembrance O
of O
some O
wild O
sad O
melody O
, O
heard O
in O
childhood O
| | O
that O
it O
would O
perpetually O
recur O
with O
its O
mute O
imploring O
agony O
. O
With O
all O
the O
court O
reeling O
before O
her O
( O
always O
save O
and O
except O
those O
awful O
two S-CARDINAL
) O
, O
she O
heard O
a O
voice O
speak O
, O
and O
answered O
the O
simple O
inquiry O
( O
something O
about O
her O
name O
) O
mechanically O
, O
as O
if O
in O
a O
dream O
. O
So O
she O
went O
on O
for O
two S-CARDINAL
or O
three S-CARDINAL
more O
questions O
, O
with O
a O
strange O
wonder O
in O
her O
brain O
, O
as O
to O
the O
reality O
of O
the O
terrible O
circumstances O
in O
which O
she O
was O
placed O
. O
Suddenly O
she O
was O
roused O
, O
she O
knew O
not O
how O
or O
by O
what O
. O
She O
was O
conscious O
that O
all O
was O
real O
, O
that O
hundreds S-CARDINAL
were O
looking O
at O
her O
, O
that O
true O
- O
sounding O
words O
were O
being O
extracted O
from O
her O
| | O
that O
that O
figure O
, O
so O
bowed O
down O
, O
with O
the O
face O
concealed O
by O
both O
hands O
, O
was O
really O
Jem O
. O
Her O
face O
flushed O
scarlet O
, O
and O
then O
paler O
than O
before O
. O
But O
in O
her O
dread O
of O
herself O
, O
with O
the O
tremendous O
secret O
imprisoned O
within O
her O
, O
she O
exerted O
every O
power O
she O
had O
to O
keep O
in O
the O
full O
understanding O
of O
what O
was O
going O
on O
, O
of O
what O
she O
was O
asked O
, O
and O
of O
what O
she O
answered O
. O
With O
all O
her O
faculties O
preternaturally O
alive O
and O
sensitive O
, O
she O
heard O
the O
next O
question O
from O
the O
pert O
young O
barrister O
, O
who O
was O
delighted O
to O
have O
the O
examination O
of O
this O
witness O
. O
" O
And O
pray O
, O
may O
I O
ask O
, O
which O
was O
the O
favoured O
lover O
? O
You O
say O
you O
knew O
both O
these O
young O
men O
. O
Which O
was O
the O
favoured O
lover O
? O
Which O
did O
you O
prefer O
? O
" O
And O
who O
was O
he O
, O
the O
questioner O
, O
that O
he O
should O
dare O
so O
lightly O
to O
ask O
of O
her O
heart's O
secrets O
? O
That O
he O
should O
dare O
to O
ask O
her O
to O
tell O
, O
before O
that O
multitude O
assembled O
there O
, O
what O
woman O
usually O
whispers O
with O
blushes O
and O
tears O
, O
and O
many O
hesitations O
, O
to O
one O
ear O
alone O
? O
So O
, O
for O
an O
instant O
, O
a O
look O
of O
indignation O
contracted O
Mary's S-PERSON
brow O
, O
as O
she O
steadily O
met O
the O
eyes O
of O
the O
impertinent O
counsellor O
. O
But O
, O
in O
that O
instant O
, O
she O
saw O
the O
hands O
removed O
from O
a O
face O
beyond O
, O
behind O
| | O
and O
a O
countenance O
revealed O
of O
such O
intense O
love O
and O
woe O
, O
— O
such O
a O
deprecating O
dread O
of O
her O
answer O
| | O
and O
suddenly O
her O
resolution O
was O
taken O
. O
The O
present O
was O
everything O
| | O
the O
future O
, O
that O
vast O
shroud O
, O
it O
was O
maddening O
to O
think O
upon O
| | O
but O
now O
she O
might O
own O
her O
fault O
, O
but O
now O
she O
might O
even O
own O
her O
love O
. O
Now O
, O
when O
the O
beloved O
stood O
thus O
, O
abhorred O
of O
men O
, O
there O
would O
be O
no O
feminine O
shame O
to O
stand O
between O
her O
and O
her O
avowal O
. O
So O
she O
also O
turned O
towards O
the O
judge O
, O
partly O
to O
mark O
that O
her O
answer O
was O
not O
given O
to O
the O
monkeyfied O
man O
who O
questioned O
her O
, O
and O
likewise O
that O
her O
face O
might O
be O
averted O
from O
, O
and O
her O
eyes O
not O
gaze O
upon O
, O
the O
form O
that O
contracted O
with O
the O
dread O
of O
the O
words O
he O
anticipated O
. O
" O
He O
asks O
me O
which O
of O
them O
two S-CARDINAL
I O
liked O
the O
best O
. O
Perhaps O
I O
liked O
Mr. O
Harry B-PERSON
Carson E-PERSON
once O
— O
I O
don't O
know O
— O
I've O
forgotten O

but O
I O
loved O
James B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
, O
that's O
now O
on O
trial O
, O
above O
what O
tongue O
can O
tell O
— O
above O
all O
else O
on O
earth O
put O
together O

I O
love O
him O
now O
better O
than O
ever O
, O
though O
he O
has O
never O
known O
a O
word O
of O
it O
till O
this B-TIME
minute E-TIME
. O
For O
you O
see O
, O
sir O
, O
mother O
died O
before O
I O
was O
thirteen S-DATE
, O
before O
I O
could O
know O
right O
from O
wrong O
about O
some O
things O
| | O
and O
I O
was O
giddy O
and O
vain O
, O
and O
ready O
to O
listen O
to O
any O
praise O
of O
my O
good O
looks O
| | O
and O
this O
poor O
young O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
fell O
in O
with O
me O
, O
and O
told O
me O
he O
loved O
me O
| | O
and O
I O
was O
foolish O
enough O
to O
think O
he O
meant O
me O
marriage O
: O
a O
mother O
is O
a O
pitiful O
loss O
to O
a O
girl O
, O
sir O

and O
so O
I O
used O
to O
fancy O
I O
could O
like O
to O
be O
a O
lady O
, O
and O
rich O
, O
and O
never O
know O
want O
any O
more O
. O
I O
never O
found O
out O
how O
dearly O
I O
loved O
another O
till O
one O
day O
, O
when O
James B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
asked O
me O
to O
marry O
him O
, O
and O
I O
was O
very O
hard O
and O
sharp O
in O
my O
answer O
( O
for O
indeed O
, O
sir O
, O
I'd O
a O
deal O
to O
bear O
just O
then O
) O
, O
and O
he O
took O
me O
at O
my O
word O
and O
left O
me O
| | O
and O
from O
that O
day O
to O
this O
I've O
never O
spoken O
a O
word O
to O
him O
, O
or O
set O
eyes O
on O
him O

though O
I'd O
fain O
have O
done O
so O
, O
to O
try O
and O
show O
him O
we O
had O
both O
been O
too O
hasty O

for O
he'd O
not O
been O
gone O
out O
of O
my O
sight O
above O
a O
minute O
before O
I O
knew O
I O
loved O
— O
far O
above O
my O
life O

" O
said O
she O
, O
dropping O
her O
voice O

she O
came O
to O
this O
second S-ORDINAL
confession O
of O
the O
strength O
of O
her O
attachment O

" O
But O
, O
if O
the O
gentleman O
asks O
me O
which O
I O
loved O
the O
best O

I O
make O
answer O
, O
I O
was O
flattered O
by O
Mr. O

pleased O

his O
flattery O

James B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
I O
— O
" O
She O
covered O
her O
face O
with O
her O
hands O

to O
hide O
the O
burning O
scarlet O
blushes O

which O
even O
dyed O
her O
fingers O

There O
was O
a O
little O
pause O

still O
, O
though O
her O
speech O
might O
inspire O
pity O
for O
the O
prisoner O
, O
it O
only O
strengthened O
the O
supposition O
of O
his O
guilt O
. O
Presently O
the O
counsellor O
went O
on O
with O
his O
examination O

" O

what O
did O
you O
say O

had O
this O
final O
conversation O

you O

Remember O
you O
are O
on O
your O
oath O
! O
" O
" O
Never O
, O
sir O
. O
I O
was O
not O
aware O
until O
I O
heard O
of O
the O
quarrel O
between O
them O
, O
and O
what O
Jem S-PERSON
had O
said O
to O
the O
policeman O
, O
and O
that O
was O
after O
the O
murder O
. O
To O
this O
day O
I O
can't O
make O
out O
who O
told O
Jem S-PERSON
. O
Oh O
, O
sir O
, O
may O
not O
I O
go O
down O
? O
" O
For O
she O
felt O
the O
sense O
, O
the O
composure O
, O
the O
very O
bodily O
strength O
which O
she O
had O
compelled O
to O
her O
aid O
for O
a O
time O
, O
suddenly O
giving O
way O
, O
and O
was O
conscious O
that O
she O
was O
losing O
all O
command O
over O
herself O
. O
There O
was O
no O
occasion O
to O
detain O
her O
longer O
| | O
she O
had O
done O
her O
part O
. O
She O
might O
go O
down O
. O
The O
evidence O
was O
still O
stronger O
against O
the O
prisoner O
| | O
but O
now O
he O
stood O
erect O
and O
firm O
, O
with O
self O
- O
respect O
in O
his O
attitude O
, O
and O
a O
look O
of O
determination O
on O
his O
face O
, O
which O
almost O
made O
it O
appear O
noble O
. O
Yet O
he O
seemed O
lost O
in O
thought O
. O
Job B-PERSON
Legh E-PERSON
had O
all O
this O
time O
been O
trying O
to O
soothe O
and O
comfort O
Mrs. O
Wilson S-PERSON
, O
who O
would O
first S-ORDINAL
be O
in O
the O
court O
, O
in O
order O
to O
see O
her O
darling O
, O
and O
then O
, O
when O
her O
sobs O
became O
irrepressible O
, O
had O
to O
be O
led O
out O
into O
the O
open O
air O
, O
and O
sat O
there O
weeping O
, O
on O
the O
steps O
of O
the O
court O
- O
house O
. O
Who O
would O
have O
taken O
charge O
of O
Mary S-PERSON
on O
her O
release O
from O
the O
witness O
- O
box O
I O
do O
not O
know O
, O
if O
Mrs. O
Sturgis S-PERSON
, O
the O
boatman's O
wife O
, O
had O
not O
been O
there O
, O
brought O
by O
her O
interest O
in O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
towards O
whom O
she O
now O
pressed O
, O
in O
order O
to O
urge O
her O
to O
leave O
the O
scene O
of O
the O
trial O
. O
" O
No O
! O
no O
! O
" O
said O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
to O
this O
proposition O
. O
" O
I O
must O
be O
here O
, O
I O
must O
watch O
that O
they O
don't O
hang O
him O
, O
you O
know O
I O
must O
. O
" O
" O
Oh O
! O
they'll O
not O
hang O
him O
! O
never O
fear O
! O
Besides O
the O
wind O
has O
changed O
, O
and O
that's O
in O
his O
favour O
. O
Come O
away O
. O
You're O
so O
hot O
, O
and O
first O
white O
and O
then O
red O
| | O
I'm O
sure O
you're O
ill O
. O
Just O
come O
away O
. O
" O
" O
Oh O
! O
I O
don't O
know O
about O
any O
thing O
but O
that O
I O
must O
stay O
, O
" O
replied O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
strange O
hurried O
manner O
, O
catching O
hold O
of O
some O
rails O
as O
if O
she O
feared O
some O
bodily O
force O
would O
be O
employed O
to O
remove O
her O
. O
So O
Mrs. O
Sturgis S-PERSON
just O
waited O
patiently O
by O
her O
, O
every O
now O
and O
then O
peeping O
among O
the O
congregation O
of O
heads O
in O
the O
body O
of O
the O
court O
, O
to O
see O
if O
her O
husband O
were O
still O
there O
. O
And O
there O
he O
always O
was O
to O
be O
seen O
, O
looking O
and O
listening O
with O
all O
his O
might O
. O
His O
wife O
felt O
easy O
that O
he O
would O
not O
be O
wanting O
her O
at O
home O
until O
the O
trial O
was O
ended O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
never O
let O
go O
her O
clutched O
hold O
on O
the O
rails O
. O
She O
wanted O
them O
to O
steady O
her O
, O
in O
that O
heaving O
, O
whirling O
court O
. O
She O
thought O
the O
feeling O
of O
something O
hard O
compressed O
within O
her O
hand O
would O
help O
her O
to O
listen O
, O
for O
it O
was O
such O
pain O
, O
such O
weary O
pain O
in O
her O
head O
, O
to O
strive O
to O
attend O
to O
what O
was O
being O
said O
. O
They O
were O
all O
at O
sea O
, O
sailing O
away O
on O
billowy O
waves O
, O
and O
every O
one O
speaking O
at O
once O
, O
and O
no O
one O
heeding O
her O
father O
, O
who O
was O
calling O
on O
them O
to O
be O
silent O
, O
and O
listen O
to O
him O
. O
Then O
again O
, O
for O
a O
brief O
second S-ORDINAL
, O
the O
court O
stood O
still O
, O
and O
she O
could O
see O
the O
judge O
, O
sitting O
up O
there O
like O
an O
idol O
, O
with O
his O
trappings O
, O
so O
rigid O
and O
stiff O
| | O
and O
Jem S-PERSON
, O
opposite O
, O
looking O
at O
her O
, O
as O
if O
to O
say O
, O
Am O
I O
to O
die O
for O
what O
you O
know O
your O
— O
—. O
Then O
she O
checked O
herself O
, O
and O
by O
a O
great O
struggle O
brought O
herself O
round O
to O
an O
instant's O
sanity O
. O
But O
the O
round O
of O
thought O
never O
stood O
still O
| | O
and O
off O
she O
went O
again O
| | O
and O
every O
time O
her O
power O
of O
struggling O
against O
the O
growing O
delirium O
grew O
fainter O
and O
fainter O
. O
She O
muttered O
low O
to O
herself O
, O
but O
no O
one O
heard O
her O
except O
her O
neighbour O
, O
Mrs. O
Sturgis S-PERSON
| | O
all O
were O
too O
closely O
attending O
to O
the O
case O
for O
the O
prosecution O
, O
which O
was O
now O
being O
wound O
up O
. O
The O
counsel O
for O
the O
prisoner O
had O
avoided O
much O
cross-examination O
, O
reserving O
to O
himself O
the O
right O
of O
calling O
the O
witnesses O
forward O
again O
| | O
for O
he O
had O
received O
so O
little O
, O
and O
such O
vague O
instructions O
, O
and O
understood O
that O
so O
much O
depended O
on O
the O
evidence O
of O
one O
who O
was O
not O
forthcoming O
, O
that O
in O
fact O
he O
had O
little O
hope O
of O
establishing O
any O
thing O
like O
a O
show O
of O
a O
defence O
, O
and O
contented O
himself O
with O
watching O
the O
case O
, O
and O
lying O
in O
wait O
for O
any O
legal O
objections O
that O
might O
offer O
themselves O
. O
He O
lay O
back O
on O
the O
seat O
, O
occasionally O
taking O
a O
pinch O
of O
snuff O
in O
a O
manner O
intended O
to O
be O
contemptuous O
| | O
now O
and O
then O
elevating O
his O
eyebrows O
, O
and O
sometimes O
exchanging O
a O
little O
note O
with O
Mr. O
Bridgenorth S-PERSON
behind O
him O
. O
The O
attorney O
had O
far O
more O
interest O
in O
the O
case O
than O
the O
barrister O
, O
to O
which O
he O
was O
perhaps O
excited O
by O
his O
poor O
old O
friend O
Job B-PERSON
Legh E-PERSON
| | O
who O
had O
edged O
and O
wedged O
himself O
through O
the O
crowd O
close O
to O
Mr. O
Bridgenorth's S-PERSON
elbow O
, O
sent O
thither O
by O
Ben B-PERSON
Sturgis E-PERSON
, O
to O
whom O
he O
had O
been O
" O
introduced O
" O
by O
Charley B-PERSON
Jones E-PERSON
, O
and O
who O
had O
accounted O
for O
Mary's S-PERSON
disappearance O
on O
the B-DATE
preceding I-DATE
day E-DATE
, O
and O
spoken O
of O
their O
chase O
, O
their O
fears O
, O
their O
hopes O
. O
All O
this O
was O
told O
in O
a O
few O
words O
to O
Mr. O
Bridgenorth S-PERSON
— O
so O
few O
, O
that O
they O
gave O
him O
but O
a O
confused O
idea O
, O
that O
time O
was O
of O
value O
| | O
and O
this O
he O
named O
to O
his O
counsel O
, O
who O
now O
rose O
to O
speak O
for O
the O
defence O
. O
Job B-PERSON
Legh E-PERSON
looked O
about O
for O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
now O
he O
had O
gained O
, O
and O
given O
, O
some O
idea O
of O
the O
position O
of O
things O
. O
At O
last O
he O
saw O
her O
, O
standing O
by O
a O
decent O
- O
looking O
woman O
, O
looking O
flushed O
and O
anxious O
, O
and O
moving O
her O
lips O
incessantly O
, O
as O
if O
eagerly O
talking O
| | O
her O
eyes O
never O
resting O
on O
any O
object O
, O
but O
wandering O
about O
as O
if O
in O
search O
of O
something O
. O
Job O
thought O
it O
was O
for O
him O
she O
was O
seeking O
, O
and O
he O
struggled O
to O
get O
round O
to O
her O
. O
When O
he O
had O
succeeded O
, O
she O
took O
no O
notice O
of O
him O
, O
although O
he O
spoke O
to O
her O
, O
but O
still O
kept O
looking O
round O
and O
round O
in O
the O
same O
wild O
, O
restless O
manner O
. O
He O
tried O
to O
hear O
the O
low O
quick O
mutterings O
of O
her O
voice O
, O
as O
he O
caught O
the O
repetition O
of O
the O
same O
words O
over O
and O
over O
again O
. O
" O
I O
must O
not O
go O
mad O
. O
I O
must O
not O
, O
indeed O
. O
They O
say O
people O
tell O
the O
truth O
when O
they're O
mad O
| | O
but O
I O
don't O
. O
I O
was O
always O
a O
liar O
. O
I O
was O
, O
indeed O
| | O
but O
I'm O
not O
mad O
. O
I O
must O
not O
go O
mad O
. O
I O
must O
not O
, O
indeed O
. O
" O
Suddenly O
she O
seemed O
to O
become O
aware O
how O
earnestly O
Job S-PERSON
was O
listening O
( O
with O
mournful O
attention O
) O
to O
her O
words O
, O
and O
turning O
sharp O
round O
upon O
him O
, O
with O
upbraiding O
for O
his O
eaves O
- O
dropping O
on O
her O
lips O
, O
she O
caught O
sight O
of O
something O
, O
— O
or O
some O
one O
, O
— O
who O
, O
even O
in O
that O
state O
, O
had O
power O
to O
arrest O
her O
attention O
, O
and O
throwing O
up O
her O
arms O
with O
wild O
energy O
, O
she O
shrieked O
aloud O
, O
" O
Oh O
, O
Jem O
! O
Jem O
! O
you're O
saved O
| | O
and O
I O
am O
mad O
— O
" O
and O
was O
instantly O
seized O
with O
convulsions O
. O
With O
much O
commiseration O
she O
was O
taken O
out O
of O
court O
, O
while O
the O
attention O
of O
many O
was O
diverted O
from O
her O
, O
by O
the O
fierce O
energy O
with O
which O
a O
sailor O
forced O
his O
way O
over O
rails O
and O
seats O
, O
against O
turnkeys O
and O
policemen O
. O
The O
officers O
of O
the O
court O
opposed O
this O
forcible O
manner O
of O
entrance O
, O
but O
they O
could O
hardly O
induce O
the O
offender O
to O
adopt O
any O
quieter O
way O
of O
attaining O
his O
object O
, O
and O
telling O
his O
tale O
in O
the O
witness O
- O
box O
, O
the O
legitimate O
place O
. O
For O
Will S-PERSON
had O
dwelt O
so O
impatiently O
on O
the O
danger O
in O
which O
his O
absence O
would O
place O
his O
cousin O
, O
that O
even O
yet O
he O
seemed O
to O
fear O
that O
he O
might O
see O
the O
prisoner O
carried O
off O
, O
and O
hung O
, O
before O
he O
could O
pour O
out O
the O
narrative O
which O
would O
exculpate O
him O
. O
As O
for O
Job B-PERSON
Legh E-PERSON
, O
his O
feelings O
were O
all O
but O
uncontrollable O
| | O
as O
you O
may O
judge O
by O
the O
indifference O
with O
which O
he O
saw O
Mary S-PERSON
borne O
, O
stiff O
and O
convulsed O
, O
out O
of O
the O
court O
, O
in O
the O
charge O
of O
the O
kind O
Mrs. O
Sturgis S-PERSON
, O
who O
, O
you O
will O
remember O
, O
was O
an O
utter O
stranger O
to O
him O
. O
" O
She'll O
keep O
! O
I'll O
not O
trouble O
myself O
about O
her O
, O
" O
said O
he O
to O
himself O
, O
as O
he O
wrote O
with O
trembling O
hands O
a O
little O
note O
of O
information O
to O
Mr. O
Bridgenorth S-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
conjectured O
, O
when O
Will S-PERSON
had O
first S-ORDINAL
disturbed O
the O
awful O
tranquillity O
of O
the O
life O
- O
and O
- O
death O
court O
, O
that O
the O
witness O
had O
arrived O
( O
better O
late O
than O
never O
) O
on O
whose O
evidence O
rested O
all O
the O
slight O
chance O
yet O
remaining O
to O
Jem B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
of O
escaping O
death O

the O
commotion O
in O

court O

his O
courage O
took O
the O
shape O
of O
presence O

mind O
, O
and O
he O
awaited O
the O
examination O
with O
a O
calm O
, O
unflinching O
intelligence O
, O
which O
dictated O
the O
clearest O
and O
most O
pertinent O
answers O

He O
told O
the O
story O
you O
know O
so O
well O
: O
how O
his O
leave O
of O
absence O
being O
nearly O
expired O

he O
had O
resolved O
to O
fulfil O
his O
promise O

go O
to O
see O
an O
uncle O
residing O
in O
the B-GPE
Isle I-GPE
of I-GPE
Man E-GPE

how O
his O
money O
( O
sailor O
- O
like O
) O
was O
all O
expended O
in O
Manchester S-GPE
, O
and O
how O
, O
consequently O
, O
it O
had O
been O
necessary O
for O
him O
to O
walk O
to O
Liverpool S-GPE
, O
which O
he O
had O
accordingly O
done O
on O
the O
very O
night O
of O
the O
murder O
, O
accompanied O
as O
far O
as O
Hollins B-PERSON
Greeb E-PERSON
by O
his O
friend O
and O
cousin O
, O
the O
prisoner O
at O
the O
bar O

He O
was O
clear O
and O
distinct O
in O
every O
corroborative O
circumstance O
, O
and O
gave O
a O
short O
account O
of O
the O
singular O
way O
in O
which O
he O
had O
been O
recalled O
from O
his O
outward O
- O
bound O
voyage O
, O
and O
the O
terrible O
anxiety O
he O
had O
felt O
, O
as O
the O
pilot O
- O
boat O
had O
struggled O
home O
against O
the O
wind O

The O
jury O
felt O
that O
their O
opinion O
( O
so O
nearly O
decided O
half O
an O
hour O
ago O
) O
was O
shaken O
and O
disturbed O
in O
a O
very O
uncomfortable O
and O
perplexing O
way O
, O
and O
were O
almost O
grateful O
to O
the O
counsel O
for O
the O
prosecution O
, O
when O
he O
got O
up O
, O
with O
a O
brow O
of O
thunder O
, O
to O
demolish O
the O
evidence O
, O
which O
was O
so O
bewildering O
when O
taken O
in O
connexion O
with O
every O
thing O
previously O
adduced O
. O
But O
if O
such O
, O
without O
looking O
to O
the O
consequences O
, O
was O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
impulsive O
feeling O
of O
some O
among O
the O
jury O
, O
how O
shall O
I O
describe O
the O
vehemence O
of O
passion O
which O
possessed O
the O
mind O
of O
poor O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
, O
as O
he O
saw O
the O
effect O
of O
the O
young O
sailor's O
statement O
? O
It O
never O
shook O
his O
belief O
in O
Jem's S-PERSON
guilt O
in O
the O
least O
, O
that O
attempt O
at O
an O
alibi O

his O
hatred O
, O
his O
longing O
for O
vengeance O
, O
having O
once O
defined O
an O
object O
to O
itself O
, O
could O
no O
more O
bear O
to O
be O
frustrated O
and O
disappointed O
than O
the O
beast O
of O
prey O
can O
submit O
to O
have O
his O
victim O
taken O
from O
his O
hungry O
jaws O

No O
more O
likeness O
to O
the O
calm O
stern O
power O
of O
Jupiter S-LOC

there O
in O
that O
white O
eager O
face O

almost O
distorted O
by O
its O
fell O
anxiety O

expression O

counsel O
to O
whom O
etiquette O
assigned O
the O
cross-examination O
of O

caught O
the O
look O
on O
Mr. O

and O
in O
his O
desire O
to O
further O
the O
intense O
wish O
there O
manifested O
, O
he O
over O
- O
shot O
his O
mark O

his O
first S-ORDINAL
insulting O
question O
: O

his O

poor O
fellow O

he O
was O
stunned O
with O
the O
rapid O
career O
of O
events O
during O
the B-TIME
last I-TIME
few I-TIME
hours E-TIME

He O
had O

at O
the O
bar O
with O
little O
or O
no O
expectation O
of O
an O
acquittal O

with O
scarcely O
any O
desire O
for O
life O

in O
the O
complication O
of O

the O
idea O

more O
than O
indifference O

him O

she O
had O
loved O
another O

and O
in O
her O
mind O
Jem S-PERSON
believed O
that O
he O
himself O
must O
be O
regarded O
as O
the O
murderer O
of O

And O
suddenly O
, O
athwart O
this O
gloom O
which O
made O
life O
seem O
such O
a O
blank O
expanse O
of O
desolation O
, O
there O
flashed O
the O
exquisite O
delight O
of O
hearing O
Mary's S-PERSON
avowal O
of O
love O
, O
making O
the O
future O
all O
glorious O
, O
if O
a O

in O
this O

he O
might O
hope O
to O
have O
. O
He O
could O
not O
dwell O
on O
any O
thing O
but O
her O
words O
, O
telling O
of O
her O
passionate O
love O

all O
else O
was O
indistinct O
, O
nor O
could O
he O
strive O
to O
make O
it O
otherwise O

She O
loved O
him O

And O
Life O
, O
now O
full O
of O
tender O
images O
, O
suddenly O
bright O
with O
all O
exquisite O
promises O
, O
hung O
on O
a O
breath O
, O
the O
slenderest O
gossamer O
chance O
. O
He O
tried O
to O
think O
that O
the O
knowledge O
of O
her O
love O
would O
soothe O
him O
even O
in O
his O
dying O
hours O

but O
the O
phantoms O
of O
what O
life O
with O
her O
might O
be O
, O
would O
obtrude O
, O
and O
made O
him O
almost O
gasp O

reel O
under O
the O
uncertainty O
he O
was O
enduring O
. O
Will's S-PERSON
appearance O
had O
only O
added O
to O
the O
intensity O
of O
this O
suspense O
. O
The O
full O
meaning O
of O
the O
verdict O
could O
not O
at O

penetrate O
his O
brain O

He O
stood O
dizzy O

pulled O
his O
coat O

He O
turned O

saw O

the O

stealing O
down O
his O
brown O

while O
he O
tried O
in O
vain O
to O
command O
voice O
enough O
to O
speak O
. O
He O
kept O
shaking O
Jem S-PERSON
by O
the O
hand O
as O
the O
best O
and O
necessary O
expression O
of O

exclaimed O
the O

, O
as O
he O
brought O
up O
another O
livid O

from O
out O

the O

Job B-PERSON

out O

all O

Jem S-PERSON
himself O

pushing O
past O
him O

for O
all O
this O

unwilling O

" O
I'd O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
one E-CARDINAL
reason O
for O
coming O

I O
wanted O

hear O
how O

that O
stood O
first S-ORDINAL

Late B-TIME
last I-TIME
night E-TIME
I O
got O
a O
letter O
from O
Margaret S-PERSON
, O
very O
anxious O
- O
like O
. O
The O
doctor O
says O
the O
old O
lady O
yonder O
can't O
last O
many O

it O
seems O
so O
lonesome O

die O
with O
no O
one O

Margaret S-PERSON

Mrs. O
Davenport S-PERSON
about O
her O

So O
I O
thought O
I'd O
just O
come O

stay O
with O
Mary B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON

see O
as O
she's O
well O

you O

your O
mother O

Will O
go O

take O
leave O
of O
old O
Alice S-PERSON

" O
Jem's O
countenance O

sad O
at O

just O
now O

fell O
lower O

But O
Job S-PERSON
went O
on O
with O
his O
speech O

" O
She O
still O

thinks O

for O

" O
Jem S-PERSON

out O
thus O
far O

when O
Job O
interrupted O

" O

All O

" O
Jem S-PERSON
felt O

not O
resist O

I O
cannot O
tell O
you O
how O
heavy O

sick O
at O
heart O

was O

take O
a O
last O
fond O
, O
lingering O
look O
at O
Mary S-PERSON

golden O
hair O

dimmed O
with O
her O

out O

all O

the O

better O
sentence O
can O
an O
emperor O
wish O

said O
over O

In O
second S-ORDINAL
childhood O
( O

clouded O
by O

again O

She O
died O
the B-DATE
day E-DATE
after O
their O
return O
from O
Liverpool S-GPE
. O
From O
that O
time O
, O
Jem S-PERSON
became O
aware O
that O
his O
mother O
was O
jealously O
watching O
for O
some O
word O
or O
sign O
which O
should O
betoken O
his O
wish O
to O
return O
to O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
And O
yet O
go O
to O
Liverpool S-GPE
he O
must O
and O
would O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
funeral O
was O
over O
, O
if O
but O
for O
a O
single O
glimpse O
of O
his O
darling O
. O
For O
Job O
had O
never O
written O
| | O
indeed O
, O
any O
necessity O
for O
his O
so O
doing O
had O
never O
entered O
his O
head O
. O
If O
Mary S-PERSON
died O
, O
he O
would O
announce O
it O
personally O
| | O
if O
she O
recovered O
, O
he O
meant O
to O
bring O
her O
home O
with O
him O
. O
Writing O
was O
to O
him O
little O
more O
than O
an O
auxiliary O
to O
natural O
history O
| | O
a O
way O
of O
ticketing O
specimens O
, O
not O
of O
expressing O
thoughts O
. O
The O
consequence O
of O
this O
want O
of O
intelligence O
as O
to O
Mary's S-PERSON
state O
was O
, O
that O
Jem S-PERSON
was O
constantly O
anticipating O
that O
every O
person O
and O
every O
scrap O
of O
paper O
was O
to O
convey O
to O
him O
the O
news O
of O
her O
death O
. O
He O
could O
not O
endure O
this O
state O
long O
| | O
but O
he O
resolved O
not O
to O
disturb O
the O
house O
by O
announcing O
to O
his O
mother O
his O
purposed O
intention O
of O
returning O
to O
Liverpool S-GPE
, O
until O
the O
dead O
had O
been O
carried O
forth O
. O
On O
Sunday B-TIME
afternoon E-TIME
they O
laid O
her O
low O
with O
many O
tears O
. O
Will O
wept O
as O
one O
who O
would O
not O
be O
comforted O
. O
The O
old O
childish O
feeling O
came O
over O
him O
, O
the O
feeling O
of O
loneliness O
at O
being O
left O
among O
strangers O
. O
By O
and O
bye O
, O
Margaret S-PERSON
timidly O
stole O
near O
him O
, O
as O
if O
waiting O
to O
console O
| | O
and O
soon O
his O
passion O
sank O
down O
to O
grief O
, O
and O
grief O
gave O
way O
to O
melancholy O
, O
and O
though O
he O
felt O
as O
if O
he O
never O
could O
be O
joyful O
again O
, O
he O
was O
all O
the O
while O
unconsciously O
approaching O
nearer O
to O
the O
full O
happiness O
of O
calling O
Margaret S-PERSON
his O
own O
, O
and O
a O
golden O
thread O
was O
interwoven O
even O
now O
with O
the O
darkness O
of O
his O
sorrow O
. O
Yet O
it O
was O
on O
his O
arm O
that O
Jane B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
leant O
on O
her O
return O
homewards O
. O
Jem S-PERSON
took O
charge O
of O
Margaret S-PERSON
. O
" O
Margaret S-PERSON
, O
I'm O
bound O
for O
Liverpool S-GPE
by O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
train O

must O
set O
your O

liberty O

" O
" O
I'm O
sure O
he O
likes O
nothing O
better O
than O
watching O
over O
poor O
Mary S-PERSON

he O
loves O
her O
nearly O
as O
well O
as O
me O
. O
But O
let O
me O
go O
! O
I O
have O
been O
so O
full O
of O
poor O
Alice S-PERSON
, O
I've O
never O
thought O
of O
it O
before O

I O
can't O
do O
so O
much O
as O
many O
a O
one O
, O
but O
Mary S-PERSON
will O
like O
to O
have O
a O
woman O
about O
her O
that O
she O
knows O
. O
I'm O
sorry O
I O
waited O
to O
be O
reminded O
, O
Jem S-PERSON
. O
" O
replied O
Margaret S-PERSON
, O
with O
some O
little O
self O
- O
reproach O
. O
But O
Margaret's S-PERSON
proposition O
did O
not O
at O
all O
agree O
with O
her O
companion's O
wishes O
. O
He O
found O
he O
had O
better O
speak O
out O
, O
and O
put O
his O
intention O
at O
once O
to O
the O
right O
motive O
| | O
the O
subterfuge O
about O
setting O
Job B-PERSON
Legh E-PERSON
at O
liberty O
had O
done O
him O
harm O
instead O
of O
good O
. O
" O
To O
tell O
truth O
, O
Margaret S-PERSON
, O
it's O
I O
that O
must O
go O
, O
and O
that O
for O
my O
own O
sake O
, O
not O
your O
grandfather's O
. O
I O
can O
rest O
neither O
by O
night O
nor O
day O
for O
thinking O
on O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
Whether O
she O
lives O
or O
dies O
I O
look O
on O
her O
as O
my O
wife O
before O
God O
, O
as O
surely O
and O
solemnly O
as O
if O
we O
were O
married O

So O
being O
, O
I O
have O
the O
greatest O
right O
to O
look O
after O
her O
, O
and O
I O
cannot O
yield O
it O
even O
to O
— O
" O
" O
Her O
father O
, O
" O
said O
Margaret S-PERSON
, O
finishing O
his O
interrupted O
sentence O
. O
" O
It O
seems O
strange O
that O
a O
girl O
like O
her O
should O
be O
thrown O
on O
the O
bare O
world O
to O
struggle O
through O
so O
bad O
an O
illness O
. O
No O
one O
seems O
to O
know O
where O
John B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
is O
, O
else O
I O
thought O
of O
getting O
Morris S-PERSON
to O
write O
him O
a O
letter O
telling O
him O
about O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
I O
wish O
he O
was O
home O
, O
that O
I O
do O
! O
" O
Jem S-PERSON
could O
not O
echo O
this O
wish O
. O
" O
Mary's S-PERSON
not O
bad O
off O
for O
friends O
where O
she O
is O
, O
" O
said O
he O
. O
" O
I O
call O
them O
friends O

though O
a B-DATE
week I-DATE
ago E-DATE
we O
none O
of O
us O
knew O
there O
were O
such O
folks O
in O
the O
world O

But O
being O
anxious O
and O
sorrowful O
about O
the O
same O
thing O
makes O
people O
friends O
quicker O
than O
any O
thing O
, O
I O
think O
. O
She's S-PERSON
like O
a O
mother O
to O
Mary S-PERSON
in O
her O
ways O

and O
he O
bears O
a O
good O
character O
, O
as O
far O
as O
I O
could O
learn O
just O
in O
that O
hurry O

We're O
drawing O
near O
home O

and O
I've O
not O
said O
my O
say O
, O
Margaret S-PERSON
. O
I O
want O
you O
to O
look O
after O
mother O
a O
bit O
. O
She'll O
not O
like O
my O
going O
, O
and O
I've O
got O
to O
break O
it O
to O
her O
yet O
. O
If O
she O
takes O
it O
very O
badly O
, O
I'll S-PERSON
come O
back O
to O
- O
morrow O
night O

but O
if O
she's O
not O
against O
it O
very O
much O
, O
I O
mean O
to O
stay O
till O
it's O
settled O
about O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
one S-CARDINAL
way O
or O
the O
other O
. O
Will O
, O
you O
know O
, O
will O
be O
there O
, O
Margaret S-PERSON
, O
to O
help O
a O
bit O
in O
doing O
for O
mother O
. O
" O
Will's O
being O
there O
made O
the O
only O
objection O
Margaret S-PERSON
saw O
to O
this O
plan O
. O
She O
disliked O
the O
idea O
of O
seeming O
to O
throw O
herself O
in O
his O
way O
| | O
and O
yet O
she O
did O
not O
like O
to O
say O
any O
thing O
of O
this O
feeling O
to O
Jem S-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
all O
along O
seemed O
perfectly O
unconscious O
of O
any O
love O
- O
affair O
, O
besides O
his O
own O
, O
in O
progress O
. O
So O
Margaret S-PERSON
gave O
a O
reluctant O
consent O
. O
" O
If O
you O
can O
just O
step O
up O
to O
our O
house O
to O
- O
night O
, O
Jem S-PERSON
, O
I'll S-PERSON
put O
up O
a O
few O
things O
as O
may O
be O
useful O
to O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
and O
then O
you O
can O
say O
when O
you'll O
likely O
be O
back O
. O
If O
you O
come O
home O
to O
- O
morrow O
night O
, O
and O
Will's S-PERSON
there O
, O
perhaps O
I O
need O
not O
step O
up O
? O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
Margaret S-PERSON
, O
do O
! O
I O
shan't O
leave O
easy O
unless O
you O
go O
some O
time O
in O
the O
day O
to O
see O
mother O

I'll O
come O
to O

night O

though O

and O
now O
good O
- O
bye O
. O
Stay O
! O
do O
you O
think O
you O
could O
just O
coax O
poor O
Will O
to O
walk O
a O
bit O
home O
with O
you O
, O
that O
I O
might O
speak O
to O
mother O
by O
myself O
? O
" O
No O
! O
that O
Margaret S-PERSON
could O
not O
do O
. O
That O
was O
expecting O
too O
great O
a O
sacrifice O
of O
bashful O
feeling O
. O
But O
the O
object O
was O
accomplished O
by O
Will's S-PERSON
going O
up O
- O
stairs O
immediately O
on O
their O
return O
to O
the O
house O
, O
to O
indulge O
his O
mournful O
thoughts O
alone O
. O
As O
soon O
as O
Jem S-PERSON
and O
his O
mother O
were O
left O
by O
themselves O
, O
he O
began O
on O
the O
subject O
uppermost O
in O
his O
mind O
. O
" O
Mother O
! O
" O
She O
put O
her O
handkerchief O
from O
her O
eyes O
, O
and O
turned O
quickly O
round O
so O
as O
to O
face O
him O
where O
he O
stood O
, O
thinking O
what O
best O
to O
say O
. O
The O
little O
action O
annoyed O
him O
, O
and O
he O
rushed O
at O
once O
into O
the O
subject O
. O
" O
Mother O
! O
I O
am O
going O
back O
to O
Liverpool S-GPE
to O
- O
morrow O
morning O
to O
see O
how O
Mary B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
is O
. O
" O
" O
And O
what's O
Mary B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
to O
thee O
, O
that O
thou O
shouldst O
be O
running O
after O
her O
in O
that O
- O
a- O
way O
? O
" O
" O
If O
she O
lives O
, O
she O
shall O
be O
my O
wedded O
wife O
. O
If O
she O
dies O
— O
mother O
, O
I O
can't O
speak O
of O
what O
I O
shall O
feel O
if O
she O
dies O
. O
" O
His O
voice O
was O
choked O
in O
his O
throat O
. O
For O
an O
instant O
his O
mother O
was O
interested O
by O
his O
words O
| | O
and O
then O
came O
back O
the O
old O
jealousy O
of O
being O
supplanted O
in O
the O
affections O
of O
that O
son O
, O
who O
had O
been O
, O
as O
it O
were O
, O
newly O
born O
to O
her O
, O
by O
the O
escape O
he O
had O
so O
lately O
experienced O
from O
danger O
. O
So O
she O
hardened O
her O
heart O
against O
entertaining O
any O
feeling O
of O
sympathy O
| | O
and O
turned O
away O
from O
the O
face O
, O
which O
recalled O
the O
earnest O
look O
of O
his O
childhood O
, O
when O
he O
had O
come O
to O
her O
in O
some O
trouble O
, O
sure O
of O
help O
and O
comfort O
. O
And O
coldly O
she O
spoke O
, O
in O
those O
tones O
which O
Jem S-PERSON
knew O
and O
dreaded O
, O
even O
before O
the O
meaning O
they O
expressed O
was O
fully O
shaped O
. O
" O
Thou'rt O
old O
enough O
to O
please O
thysel O
. O
Old O
mothers O
are O
cast O
aside O
, O
and O
what O
they've O
borne O
forgotten O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
a O
pretty O
face O
comes O
across O
. O
I O
might O
have O
thought O
of O
that O
last B-DATE
Tuesday E-DATE
, O
when O
I O
felt O
as O
if O
thou O
wert O
all O
my O

the O
judge O
were O
some O
wild O
animal O
trying O
to O
rend O
thee O
from O
me O

I O
spoke O
up O
for O
thee O
then O

it's O
all O
forgotten O
now O

Jem S-PERSON
got O
up O
, O
and O
walked O
about O
the O
room O
in O
despairing O
impatience O
. O
She O
would O
not O
understand O
his O
feelings O
. O
At O
last O
he O
stopped O
right O
before O
the O
place O
where O
she O
was O
sitting O
, O
with O
an O
air O
of O
injured O
meekness O
on O
her O
face O
. O
" O
Mother O
! O
I O
often O
think O
what O
a O
good O
man O
father O
was O

often O
heard O
you O
tell O
of O
your O
courting O
days O

of O
the O
accident O
that O
befell O
you O

with O
a O
sigh O

" O
You O
little O

you O

live O

such O

fine O

you O
now O

She O
smiled O
a O
little O
, O

looked O
up O
at O
him O
, O

was O
just O
what O
he O
wanted O

Thou'rt O
not O

looking O
at O
him O

much O
fondness O

depreciatory O

He O
took O
another O
turn O
or O
two S-CARDINAL
up O

down O
the O
room O

He O
wanted O

bend O
the O

sorrowfully O

" O

said O
he O
at O
last O

stopping O
short O

sad O
voice O

self O

" O
The O
hard O
look O
left O
her O
face O

though O
her O
eyes O
were O
still O
averted O
from O
Jem's S-PERSON
gaze O

it O
was O
more O

were O
brimming O
over O
with O
tears O

called O
forth O
by O
his O
words O

any O

And O
when O
his O
manly O
voice O
died O
away O
in O
low O
pleadings O

she O
lifted O
up O
her O
hands O

down O

she O
solemnly O

Jem's S-PERSON
heart O
leaped O
up O

from O
this O
time O
hope O
took O
the O
place O
of O
fear O

his O
anticipations O

Margaret S-PERSON
had O
felt O
the O
evening O
long O

lonely O

and O
was O
all O
but O
giving O
up O
the O
thoughts O
of O
Jem's S-PERSON
coming O
that O
night O
, O
when O
she O
heard O
his O
step O
at O
the O
door O
. O
He O
told O
her O
of O
his O
progress O
with O
his O
mother O

he O
told O
her O
his O
hopes O

was O
silent O
on O
the O
subject O
of O
his O
fears O

" O
To O
think O
how O
sorrow O

joy O
are O
mixed O
up O
together O

You'll O
date O
your O

in O
life O

Mary's S-PERSON
acknowledged O
lover O

burial O
day O

Well O
! O
the O
dead O
are O
soon O
forgotten O
! O
" O
" O
Dear O
Margaret S-PERSON
! O
— O
But O
you're O
worn O
out O
with O
your O
long O
evening O
waiting O
for O
me O
. O
I O
don't O
wonder O
. O
But O
never O
you O
, O
nor O
any O
one O
else O
, O
think O
because O
God O
sees O
fit O
to O
call O
up O
new O
interests O
, O
perhaps O
right O
out O
of O
the O
grave O
, O
that O
therefore O
the O
dead O
are O
forgotten O
. O
Margaret S-PERSON
, O
you O
yourself O
can O
remember O
our O
looks O
, O
and O
fancy O
what O
we're O
like O
. O
" O
" O
Yes O
! O
but O
what O
has O
that O
to O
do O
with O
remembering O
Alice S-PERSON
? O
" O
" O
Why O
, O
just O
this O
. O
You're O
not O
always O
trying O
to O
think O
on O
our O
faces O
, O
and O
making O
a O
labour O
of O
remembering O

but O
often O
, O
I'll O
be O
bound O
, O
when O
you're O
sinking O
off O
to O
sleep O
, O
or O
when O
you're O
very O
quiet O
and O
still O
, O
the O
faces O
you O
knew O
so O
well O
when O
you O
could O
see O
, O
come O
smiling O
before O
you O
with O
loving O
looks O
. O
Or O
you O
remember O
them O
, O
without O
striving O
after O
it O
, O
and O
without O
thinking O
it's O
your O
duty O
to O
keep O
recalling O
them O
. O
And O
so O
it O
is O
with O
them O
that O
are O
hidden O
from O
our O
sight O
. O
If O
they've O
been O
worthy O
to O
be O
heartily O
loved O
while O
alive O
, O
they'll O
not O
be O
forgotten O
when O
dead O
| | O
it's O
against O
nature O
. O
And O
we O
need O
no O
more O
be O
upbraiding O
ourselves O
for O
letting O
in O
God's O
rays O
of O
light O
upon O
our O
sorrow O
, O
and O
no O
more O
be O
fearful O
of O
forgetting O
them O
, O
because O
their O
memory O
is O
not O
always O
haunting O
and O
taking O
up O
our O
minds O
, O
than O
you O
need O
to O
trouble O
yourself O
about O
remembering O
your O
grandfather's O
face O
, O
or O
what O
the O
stars O
were O
like O

you O
can't O
forget O
if O
you O

, O
what O
it's O
such O
a O
pleasure O
to O
think O
about O

not O
now O

full O
about O

kept O
it O
down O
so O
long O

glad O

how O
gentle O

easy O
her O
death O
was O

fell O
into O
calm O

struck O

bearing O

with O
evident O
and O
painful O
labour O
, O
a O
jug O
of O
water O
from O
the O
neighbouring O
pump O
. O
It O
went O
before O
Jem S-PERSON
, O
turned O
up O
the O
court O
at O
the O
corner O
of O
which O
he O
was O
standing O
, O
passed O
into O
the O
broad O
, O
calm O
light O
| | O
and O
there O
, O
with O
bowed O
head O
, O
sinking O
and O
shrunk O
body O
, O
Jem S-PERSON
recognised O
John B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
. O
No O
haunting O
ghost O
could O
have O
had O
less O
of O
the O
energy O
of O
life O
in O
its O
involuntary O
motions O
than O
he O
, O
who O
, O
nevertheless O
, O
went O
on O
with O
the O
same O
measured O
clock O
- O
work O
tread O
until O
the O
door O
of O
his O
own O
house O
was O
reached O
. O
And O
then O
he O
disappeared O
, O
and O
the O
latch O
fell O
feebly O
to O
, O
and O
made O
a O
faint O
and O
wavering O
sound O
, O
breaking O
the O
solemn O
silence O
of O
the O
night O
. O
Then O
all O
again O
was O
still O
. O
For O
a B-TIME
minute E-TIME
or O
two S-CARDINAL
Jem S-PERSON
stood O
motionless O
, O
stunned O
by O
the O
thoughts O
which O
the O
sight O
of O
Mary's S-PERSON
father O
had O
called O
up O
. O
Margaret S-PERSON
did O
not O
know O
he O
was O
at O
home O
: O
had O
he O
stolen O
like O
a O
thief O
by O
dead O
of O
night O
into O
his O
own O
dwelling O
? O
Depressed O
as O
Jem S-PERSON
had O
often O
and O
long O
seen O
him O
, O
this O
night O
there O
was O
something O
different O
about O
him O
still O
| | O
beaten O
down O
by O
some O
inward O
storm O
, O
he O
seemed O
to O
grovel O
along O
, O
all O
self O
- O
respect O
lost O
and O
gone O
. O
Must O
he O
be O
told O
of O
Mary's S-PERSON
state O
? O
Jem S-PERSON
felt O
he O
must O
not O
| | O
and O
this O
for O
many O
reasons O
. O
He O
could O
not O
be O
informed O
of O
her O
illness O
without O
many O
other O
particulars O
being O
communicated O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
of O
which O
it O
were O
better O
he O
should O
be O
kept O
in O
ignorance O
| | O
indeed O
, O
of O
which O
Mary S-PERSON
herself O
could O
alone O
give O
the O
full O
explanation O
. O
No O
suspicion O
that O
he O
was O
the O
criminal O
seemed O
hitherto O
to O
have O
been O
excited O
in O
the O
mind O
of O
any O
one O
. O
Added O
to O
these O
reasons O
was O
Jem's S-PERSON
extreme O
unwillingness O
to O
face O
him O
, O
with O
the O
belief O
in O
his O
breast O
that O
he O
, O
and O
none O
other O
, O
had O
done O
the O
fearful O
deed O
. O
It O
was O
true O
that O
he O
was O
Mary's S-PERSON
father O
, O
and O
as O
such O
had O
every O
right O
to O
be O
told O
of O
all O
concerning O
her O
| | O
but O
supposing O
he O
were O
, O
and O
that O
he O
followed O
the O
impulse O
so O
natural O
to O
a O
father O
, O
and O
wished O
to O
go O
to O
her O
, O
what O
might O
be O
the O
consequences O
? O
Among O
the O
mingled O
feelings O
she O
had O
revealed O
in O
her O
delirium O
, O
ay O
, O
mingled O
even O
with O
the O
most O
tender O
expressions O
of O
love O
for O
her O
father O
, O
was O
a O
sort O
of O
horror O
of O
him O
| | O
a O
dread O
of O
him O
as O
a O
blood O
- O
shedder O
, O
which O
seemed O
to O
separate O
him O
into O
two S-CARDINAL
persons O
, O
— O
one O
, O
the O
father O
who O
had O
dandled O
her O
on O
his O
knee O
, O
and O
loved O
her O
all O
her O
life O
long O
| | O
the O
other O
, O
the O
assassin O
, O
the O
cause O
of O
all O
her O
trouble O
and O
woe O
. O
If O
he O
presented O
himself O
before O
her O
while O
this O
idea O
of O
his O
character O
was O
uppermost O
, O
who O
might O
tell O
the O
consequence O
? O
Jem S-PERSON
could O
not O
, O
and O
would O
not O
, O
expose O
her O
to O
any O
such O
fearful O
chance O
: O
and O
to O
tell O
the O
truth O
, O
I O
believe O
he O
looked O
upon O
her O
as O
more O
his O
own O
, O
to O
guard O
from O
all O
shadow O
of O
injury O
with O
most O
loving O
care O
, O
than O
as O
belonging O
to O
any O
one O
else O
in O
this O
world O
, O
though O
girt O
with O
the O
reverend O
name O
of O
Father O
, O
and O
guiltless O
of O
aught O
that O
might O
have O
lessened O
such O
reverence O
. O
If O
you O
think O
this O
account O
of O
mine O
confused O
, O
of O
the O
half O
- O
feelings O
, O
half S-CARDINAL
- O
reasons O
, O
which O
passed O
through O
Jem's S-PERSON
mind O
, O
as O
he O
stood O
gazing O
at O
the O
empty O
space O
, O
where O
that O
crushed O
form O
had O
so O
lately O
been O
seen O
, O

if O
you O
are O
perplexed O
to O
disentangle O
the O
real O
motives O
, O
I O
do O
assure O
you O
it O
was O
from O
just O
such O
an O
involved O
set O
of O
thoughts O
that O
Jem S-PERSON
drew O
the O
resolution O
to O
act O
as O

Mary S-PERSON
still O
hovered O
between O
life O
and O
death O
when O
Jem S-PERSON
arrived O
at O
the O
house O
where O
she O
lay O
| | O
and O
the O
doctors O
were O
as O
yet O
unwilling O
to O
compromise O
their O
wisdom O
by O
allowing O
too O
much O
hope O
to O
be O
entertained O
. O
But O
the O
state O
of O
things O
, O
if O
not O
less O
anxious O
, O
was O
less O
distressing O
than O
when O
Jem S-PERSON
had O
quitted O
her O
. O
She O
lay O
now O
in O
a O
stupor O
, O
which O
was O
partly O
disease O
, O
and O
partly O
exhaustion O
after O
the O
previous O
excitement O
. O
And O
now O
Jem S-PERSON
found O
the O
difficulty O
which O
every O
one O
who O
has O
watched O
by O
a O
sick O
bed O
knows O
full O
well O
| | O
and O
which O
is O
perhaps O
more O
insurmountable O
to O
men O
than O
it O
is O
to O
women O
, O
— O
the O
difficulty O
of O
being O
patient O
, O
and O
trying O
not O
to O
expect O
any O
visible O
change O
for O
long O
, O
long O
hours O
of O
sad O
monotony O
. O
But O
after O
awhile O
the O
reward O
came O
. O
The O
laboured O
breathing O
became O
lower O
and O
softer O
, O
the O
heavy O
look O
of O
oppressive O
pain O
melted O
away O
from O
the O
face O
, O
and O
a O
languor O
that O
was O
almost O
peace O
took O
the O
place O
of O
suffering O
. O
She O
slept O
a O
natural O
sleep O
| | O
and O
they O
stole O
about O
on O
tip O
- O
toe O
, O
and O
spoke O
low O
, O
and O
softly O
, O
and O
hardly O
dared O
to O
breathe O
, O
however O
much O
they O
longed O
to O
sigh O
out O
their O
thankful O
relief O
. O
She O
opened O
her O
eyes O
. O
Her O
mind O
was O
in O
the O
tender O
state O
of O
a O
lately O
- O
born O
infant's O
. O
She O
was O
pleased O
with O
the O
gay O
but O
not O
dazzling O
colours O
of O
the O
paper O
| | O
soothed O
by O
the O
subdued O
light O
| | O
and O
quite O
sufficiently O
amused O
by O
looking O
at O
all O
the O
objects O
in O
the O
room O
, O
— O
the O
drawing O
of O
the O
ships O
, O
the O
festoons O
of O
the O
curtain O
, O
the O
bright O
flowers O
on O
the O
painted O
backs O
of O
the O
chairs O
, O
— O
to O
care O
for O
any O
stronger O
excitement O
. O
She O
wondered O
at O
the O
ball O
of O
glass O
, O
containing O
various O
coloured O
sands O
from O
the B-LOC
Isle I-LOC
of I-LOC
Wight E-LOC
, O
or O
some O
such O
place O
, O
which O
hung O
suspended O
from O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
little O
valance O
over O
the O
window O
. O
But O
she O
did O
not O
care O
to O
exert O
herself O
to O
ask O
any O
questions O
, O
although O
she O
saw O
Mrs. O
Sturgis S-PERSON
standing O
at O
the O
bed O
- O
side O
with O
some O
tea O
, O
ready O
to O
drop O
it O
into O
her O
mouth O
by O
spoonfuls O
. O
She O
did O
not O
see O
the O
face O
of O
honest O
joy O
, O
of O
earnest O
thankfulness O
, O
— O
the O
clasped O
hands O
, O
— O
the O
beaming O
eyes O
, O
— O
the O
trembling O
eagerness O
of O
gesture O
, O
of O
one O
who O
had O
long O
awaited O
her O
awakening O
, O
and O
who O
now O
stood O
behind O
the O
curtains O
watching O
through O
some O
little O
chink O
her O
every O
faint O
motion O
| | O
or O
if O
she O
had O
caught O
a O
glimpse O
of O
that O
loving O
, O
peeping O
face O
, O
she O
was O
in O
too O
exhausted O
a O
state O
to O
have O
taken O
much O
notice O
, O
or O
have O
long O
retained O
the O
impression O
that O
he O
she O
loved O
so O
well O
was O
hanging O
about O
her O
, O
and O
blessing O
God O
for O
every O
conscious O
look O
which O
stole O
over O
her O
countenance O
. O
She O
fell O
softly O
into O
slumber O
, O
without O
a O
word O
having O
been O
spoken O
by O
any O
one O
during O
that B-TIME
half I-TIME
hour E-TIME
of O
inexpressible O
joy O
. O
And O
again O
the O
stillness O
was O
enforced O
by O
sign O
and O
whispered O
word O
, O
but O
with O
eyes O
that O
beamed O
out O
their O
bright O
thoughts O
of O
hope O
. O
Jem S-PERSON
sat O
by O
the O
side O
of O
the O
bed O
, O
holding O
back O
the O
little O
curtain O
, O
and O
gazing O
as O
if O
he O
could O
never O
gaze O
his O
fill O
at O
the O
pale O
, O
wasted O
face O
, O
so O
marbled O
and O
so O
chiselled O
in O
its O
wan O
outline O
. O
She O
wakened O
once O
more O
| | O
her O
soft O
eyes O
opened O
, O
and O
met O
his O
over O
- O
bending O
look O
. O
She O
smiled O
gently O
, O
as O
a O
baby O
does O
when O
it O
sees O
its O
mother O
tending O
its O
little O
cot O
| | O
and O
continued O
her O
innocent O
, O
infantine O
gaze O
into O
his O
face O
, O
as O
if O
the O
sight O
gave O
her O
much O
unconscious O
pleasure O
. O
But O
by O
- O
and O
- O
by O
a O
different O
expression O
came O
into O
her O
sweet O
eyes O
| | O
a O
look O
of O
memory O
and O
intelligence O
| | O
her O
white O
face O
flushed O
the O
brightest O
rosy O
red O
, O
and O
with O
feeble O
motion O
she O
tried O
to O
hide O
her O
head O
in O
the O
pillow O
. O
It O
required O
all O
Jem's S-PERSON
self O
- O
control O
to O
do O
what O
he O
knew O
and O
felt O
to O
be O
necessary O
, O
to O
call O
Mrs. O
Sturgis S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
quietly O
dozing O
by O
the O
fireside O
| | O
and O
that O
done O
, O
he O
felt O
almost O
obliged O
to O
leave O
the O
room O
to O
keep O
down O
the O
happy O
agitation O
which O
would O
gush O
out O
in O
every O
feature O
, O
every O
gesture O
, O
and O
every O
tone O
. O
From O
that O
time O
forward O
Mary's S-PERSON
progress O
towards O
health O
was O
rapid O
. O
There O
was O
every O
reason O
, O
but O
one O
, O
in O
favour O
of O
her O
speedy O
removal O
home O
. O
All O
Jem's S-ORG
duties O
lay O
in O
Manchester S-GPE

It O
was O
his O
mother's O
dwelling O
- O
place O
, O
and O
there O
his O
plans O
for O
life O
had O
been O
to O
be O
worked O
out O

plans O
, O
which O
the O
suspicion O
and O
imprisonment O
he O
had O
fallen O
into O
, O
had O
thrown O
for O
a O
time O
into O
a O
chaos O
, O
which O
his O
presence O
was O
required O
to O
arrange O
into O
form O

For O
he O
might O
find O
, O
in O

of O
a O
jury's O
verdict O
, O
that O
too O

his O
character O

him O
ever O

remembered O
the O
manner O
in O
which O
some O
one O
suspected O
of O
having O
been O
a O
convict O
was O
shunned O
by O
masters O
and O
men O
, O
when O
he O
had O
accidentally O
met O
with O
work O
in O
their O
foundry O
| | O
the O
recollection O
smote O
him O
now O
, O
how O
he O
himself O
had O
thought O
that O
it O
did O
not O
become O
an O
honest O
upright O
man O
to O
associate O
with O
one O
who O
had O
been O
a O
prisoner O
. O
He O
could O
not O
choose O
but O
think O
on O
that O
poor O
humble O
being O
, O
with O
his O
downcast O
conscious O
look O
| | O
hunted O
out O
of O
the O
work O
- O
shop O
, O
where O
he O
had O
sought O
to O
earn O
an O
honest O
livelihood O
, O
by O
the O
looks O
, O
and O
half S-CARDINAL
- O
spoken O
words O
, O
and O
the O
black O
silence O
of O
repugnance O
( O
worse O
than O
words O
to O
bear O
) O
, O
that O
met O
him O
on O
all O
sides O
. O
Jem S-PERSON
felt O
that O
his O
own O
character O
had O
been O
attainted O
| | O
and O
that O
to O
many O
it O
might O
still O
appear O
suspicious O
. O
He O
knew O
that O
he O
could O
convince O
the O
world O
, O
by O
a O
future O
as O
blameless O
as O
his O
past O
had O
been O
, O
that O
he O
was O
innocent O
. O
But O
at O
the O
same O
time O
he O
saw O
that O
he O
must O
have O
patience O
, O
and O
nerve O
himself O
for O
some O
trials O
| | O
and O
the O
sooner O
these O
were O
undergone O
, O
the O
sooner O
he O
was O
aware O
of O
the O
place O
he O
held O
in O
men's O
estimation O
, O
the O
better O
. O
He O
longed O
to O
have O
presented O
himself O
once O
more O
at O
the O
foundry O
| | O
and O
then O
the O
reality O
would O
drive O
away O
the O
pictures O
that O
would O
( O
unbidden O
) O
come O
of O
a O
shunned O
man O
, O
eyed O
askance O
by O
all O
, O
and O
driven O
forth O
to O
shape O
out O
some O
new O
career O
. O
I O
said O
every O
reason O
" O
but O
one O
" O
inclined O
Jem S-PERSON
to O
hasten O
Mary's S-PERSON
return O
as O
soon O
as O
she O
was O
sufficiently O
convalescent O
. O
That O
one O
was O
the O
meeting O
which O
awaited O
her O
at O
home O
. O
Turn O
it O
over O
as O
Jem S-PERSON
would O
, O
he O
could O
not O
decide O
what O
was O
the O
best O
course O
to O
pursue O
. O
He O
could O
compel O
himself O
to O
any O
line O
of O
conduct O
that O
his O
reason O
and O
his O
sense O
of O
right O
told O
him O
to O
be O
desirable O
| | O
but O
they O
did O
not O
tell O
him O
it O
was O
desirable O
to O
speak O
to O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
in O
her O
tender O
state O
of O
mind O
and O
body O
, O
of O
her O
father O
. O
How O
much O
would O
be O
implied O
by O
the O
mere O
mention O
of O
his O
name O
! O
Speak O
it O
as O
calmly O
, O
and O
as O
indifferently O
as O
he O
might O
, O
he O
could O
not O
avoid O
expressing O
some O
consciousness O
of O
the O
terrible O
knowledge O
she O
possessed O
. O
She O
, O
for O
her O
part O
, O
was O
softer O
and O
gentler O
than O
she O
had O
ever O
been O
in O
her O
gentlest O
mood O
| | O
since O
her O
illness O
, O
her O
motions O
, O
her O
glances O
, O
her O
voice O
were O
all O
tender O
in O
their O
languor O
. O
It O
seemed O
almost O
a O
trouble O
to O
her O
to O
break O
the O
silence O
with O
the O
low O
sounds O
of O
her O
own O
sweet O
voice O
, O
and O
her O
words O
fell O
sparingly O
on O
Jem's S-PERSON
greedy O
, O
listening O
ear O
. O
Her O
face O
was O
, O
however O
, O
so O
full O
of O
love O
and O
confidence O
, O
that O
Jem S-PERSON
felt O
no O
uneasiness O
at O
the O
state O
of O
silent O
abstraction O
into O
which O
she O
often O
fell O
. O
If O
she O
did O
but O
love O
him O
, O
all O
would O
yet O
go O
right O
| | O
and O
it O
was O
better O
not O
to O
press O
for O
confidence O
on O
that O
one S-CARDINAL
subject O
which O
must O
be O
painful O
to O
both O
. O
There O
came O
a O
fine O
, O
bright O
, O
balmy O
day O
. O
And O
Mary S-PERSON
tottered O
once O
more O
out O
into O
the O
open O
air O
, O
leaning O
on O
Jem's S-PERSON
arm O
, O
and O
close O
to O
his O
beating O
heart O
. O
And O
Mrs. O
Sturgis S-PERSON
watched O
them O
from O
her O
door O
, O
with O
a O
blessing O
on O
her O
lips O
, O
as O
they O
went O
slowly O
up O
the O
street O
. O
They O
came O
in O
sight O
of O
the O
river O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
shuddered O
. O
" O
Oh O
, O
Jem O
! O
take O
me O
home O
. O
Yon O
river O
seems O
all O
made O
of O
glittering O
, O
heaving O
, O
dazzling O
metal O
, O
just O
as O
it O
did O
when O
I O
began O
to O
be O
ill O
. O
" O
Jem S-PERSON
led O
her O
homewards O
. O
She O
dropped O
her O
head O
as O
searching O
for O
something O
on O
the O
ground O
. O
" O
Jem S-PERSON
! O
" O
He O
was O
all O
attention O
. O
She O
paused O
for O
an O
instant O
. O
" O
When O
may O
I O
go O
home O
? O
To O
Manchester S-GPE
, O
I O
mean O
. O
I O
am O
so O
weary O
of O
this O
place O
| | O
and O
I O
would O
fain O
be O
at O
home O
. O
" O
She O
spoke O
in O
a O
feeble O
voice O
| | O
not O
at O
all O
impatiently O
, O
as O
the O
words O
themselves O
would O
seem O
to O
intimate O
, O
but O
in O
a O
mournful O
way O
, O
as O
if O
anticipating O
sorrow O
even O
in O
the O
very O
fulfilment O
of O
her O
wishes O
. O
" O
Darling S-PERSON
! O
we O
will O
go O
whenever O
you O
wish O

whenever O
you O
feel O
strong O
enough O
. O
I O
asked O
Job O
to O
tell O
Margaret S-PERSON
to O
get O
all O
in O
readiness O
for O
you O
to O
go O
there O
at O
first S-ORDINAL

She'll O
tend O
you O

nurse O
you O

You O
must O
not O
go O
home O

" O
" O
Ah O
! O
but O
I O
must O
go O
home O
, O
Jem S-PERSON

I'll O
try O
and O
not O
fail O
now O
in O
what's O
right O

There O
are O
things O
we O
must O

( O
lowering O
her O
voice O
) O
, O
" O

you'll O
be O
really O
kind O
if O
you'll O
not O

against O
my O

Let O
us O
say O
no O
more O
about O
it O
, O
dear O
Jem S-PERSON

I O
must O
go O

I O

" O
Not O

Mary S-PERSON
! O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
alone O

I O
cannot O
tell O
you O
why O
I O

And O
if O

Promise O
, O
dear O
Jem S-PERSON
, O
promise O
! O
" O
He O
promised O

to O
gratify O
that O
beseeching O
face O
he O
promised O
. O
And O
then O
he O
repented O
, O
and O
felt O
as O
if O
he O
had O
done O
ill O
. O
Then O
again O
he O
felt O
as O
if O
she O
were O
the O
best O
judge O
, O
and O
knowing O
all O
( O
perhaps O
more O
than O
even O
he O
did O
) O
might O
be O
forming O
plans O
which O
his O
interference O
would O
mar O
. O
One S-CARDINAL
thing O
was O
certain O
! O
it O
was O
a O
miserable O
thing O
to O
have O
this O
awful O
forbidden O
ground O
of O
discourse O
| | O
to O
guess O
at O
each O
other's O
thoughts O
, O
when O
eyes O
were O
averted O
, O
and O
cheeks O
blanched O
, O
and O
words O
stood O
still O
, O
arrested O
in O
their O
flow O
by O
some O
casual O
allusion O
. O
At O
last O
a O
day O
, O
fine O
enough O
for O
Mary S-PERSON
to O
travel O
on O
, O
arrived O
. O
She O
had O
wished O
to O
go O
, O
but O
now O
her O
courage O
failed O
her O
. O
How O
could O
she O
have O
said O
she O
was O
weary O
of O
that O
quiet O
house O
, O
where O
even O
Ben B-PERSON
Sturgis' E-PERSON
grumblings O
only O
made O
a O
kind O
of O
harmonious O
bass O
in O
the O
concord O
between O
him O
and O
his O
wife O
, O
so O
thoroughly O
did O
they O
know O
each O
other O
with O
the O
knowledge O
of O
many O
years O

How O
could O
she O
have O
longed O
to O
quit O
that O
little O
peaceful O
room O
where O
she O
had O
experienced O
such O
loving O
tendence O
! O
Even O
the O
very O
check O
bed O

curtains O
became O
dear O
to O
her O
under O
the O
idea O
of O
seeing O
them O
no O
more O

If O
it O
was O
so O
with O
inanimate O
objects O

if O
they O

such O
power O

exciting O
regret O

what O
were O
her O
feelings O
with O
regard O

the O
kind O
old O

who O
had O
taken O
the O
stranger O

cared O
for O
her O

nursed O
her O

Each O
wilful O
sentence O
spoken O
in O
the O
half S-CARDINAL
unconscious O
irritation O
of O
feebleness O
came O
now O
with O
avenging O
self O
- O
reproach O
to O
her O
memory O
, O
as O
she O
hung O
about O
Mrs. O
Sturgis S-PERSON
, O
with O
many O
tears O
, O
which O
served O
instead O
of O
words O
to O
express O
her O
gratitude O
and O
love O
. O
Ben S-PERSON
bustled O
about O
with O
the O
square O
bottle O
of O
Goldenwasser S-PERSON
in O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
his O
hands O
, O
and O
a O
small O
tumbler O
in O
the O
other O
| | O
he O
went O
to O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
Jem S-PERSON
, O
and O
his O
wife O
in O
succession O
, O
pouring O
out O
a O
glass O
for O
each O
and O
bidding O
them O
drink O
it O
to O
keep O
their O
spirits O
up O
: O
but O
as O
each O
severally O
refused O
, O
he O
drank O
it O
himself O

and O
passed O
on O
to O
offer O
the O
same O
hospitality O
to O
another O
with O
the O
like O
refusal O
, O
and O
the O
like O
result O
. O
When O
he O
had O
swallowed O
the O
last O
of O
the O
three S-CARDINAL
draughts O
, O
he O
condescended O
to O
give O
his O
reasons O
for O
having O
done O
so O
. O
" O
I O
cannot O
abide O
waste O
. O
What's O
poured O
out O
mun O
be O
drunk O
. O
That's O
my O
maxim O
. O
" O
So O
saying O
, O
he O
replaced O
the O
bottle O
in O
the O
cupboard O
. O
It O
was O
he O
who O
in O
a O
firm O
commanding O
voice O
at O
last O
told O
Jem S-PERSON
and O
Mary S-PERSON
to O
be O
off O
, O
or O
they O
would O
be O
too O
late O
. O
Mrs. O
Sturgis S-PERSON
had O
kept O
up O
till O
then O

but O
as O
they O
left O
her O
house O
, O
she O
could O
no O
longer O
restrain O
her O
tears O
, O
and O
cried O
aloud O
in O
spite O
of O
her O
husband's O
upbraiding O
. O
" O
Perhaps O
they'll O
be O
too O
late O
for O
th' O
train O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
she O
, O
with O
a O
degree O
of O
hope O
, O
as O
the O
clock O
struck O
two S-CARDINAL
. O
" O
What O
! O
and O
come O
back O
again O

done O
our O

cried O
our O
cry O

them O
three S-CARDINAL
glasses O

had O
made O
a O
hole O
in O
the O
stuff O

I O
can O
tell O
you O

Time B-PERSON
Jack E-PERSON
was O
back O
from O
Hamburg S-GPE
with O
some O
more O
. O
" O
When O
they O
reached O
Manchester S-GPE
, O
Mary S-PERSON
looked O
very O
white O
, O
and O
the O
expression O
on O
her O
face O
was O
almost O
stern O
. O
She O
was O
in O
fact O
summoning O
up O
her O
resolution O
to O
meet O
her O
father O
if O
he O
were O
at O
home O

Jem S-PERSON
had O
never O
named O
his O
midnight O
glimpse O
of O
John B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
to O
human O
being O
| | O
but O
Mary S-PERSON
had O
a O
sort O
of O
presentiment O
that O
wander O
where O
he O
would O
, O
he O
would O
seek O
his O
home O
at O
last O
. O
But O
in O
what O
mood O
she O
dreaded O
to O
think O
. O
For O
the O
knowledge O
of O
her O
father's O
capability O
of O
guilt O
seemed O
to O
have O
opened O
a O
dark O
gulf O
in O
his O
character O
, O
into O
the O
depths O
of O
which O
she O
trembled O
to O
look O
. O
At O
one O
moment O
she O
would O
fain O
have O
claimed O
protection O
against O
the O
life O
she O
must O
lead O
, O
for O
some O
time O
at O
least O
, O
alone O
with O
a O
murderer O
! O
She O
thought O
of O
his O
gloom O
, O
before O
his O
mind O
was O
haunted O
by O
the O
memory O
of O
so O
terrible O
a O
crime O
| | O
his O
moody O
, O
irritable O
ways O
. O
She O
imagined O
the O
evenings O
as O
of O
old O
: O
she O
, O
toiling O
at O
some O
work O
, O
long O
after O
houses O
were O
shut O
, O
and O
folks O
abed O
| | O
he O
, O
more O
savage O
than O
he O
had O
ever O
been O
before O
with O
the O
inward O
gnawing O
of O
his O
remorse O
. O
At O
such O
times O
she O
could O
have O
cried O
aloud O
with O
terror O
, O
at O
the O
scenes O
her O
fancy O
conjured O
up O
. O
But O
her O
filial O
duty O
, O
nay O
, O
her O
love O
and O
gratitude O
for O
many O
deeds O
of O
kindness O
done O
to O
her O
as O
a O
little O
child O
, O
conquered O
all O
fear O
. O
She O
would O
endure O
all O
imaginable O
terrors O
, O
although O
of O
daily O
occurrence O
. O
And O
she O
would O
patiently O
bear O
all O
wayward O
violence O
of O
temper O
| | O
more O
than O
patiently O
would O
she O
bear O
it O
— O
pitifully O
, O
as O
one O
who O
knew O
of O
some O
awful O
curse O
awaiting O
the O
blood O
- O
shedder O
. O
She O
would O
watch O
over O
him O
tenderly O
, O
as O
the O
Innocent O
should O
watch O
over O
the O
Guilty O
| | O
awaiting O
the O
gracious O
seasons O
, O
wherein O
to O
pour O
oil O
and O
balm O
into O
the O
bitter O
wounds O
. O
With O
the O
untroubled O
peace O
which O
the O
resolve O
to O
endure O
to O
the O
end O
gives O
, O
she O
approached O
the O
house O
that O
from O
habit O
she O
still O
called O
home O
, O
but O
which O
possessed O
the O
holiness O
of O
home O
no O
longer O
. O
" O
Jem S-PERSON
! O
" O
said O
she O
, O
as O
they O
stood O
at O
the O
entrance O
to O
the O
court O
, O
close O
by O
Job B-ORG
Legh's E-ORG
door O
, O
" O
you O
must O
go O
in O
there O
and O
wait O
half B-TIME

Not O
less O

If O

that O
time O
I O
don't O
come O
back O
, O
you O
go O
your O
ways O

her O
my O

will O
send O
by O
Margaret S-PERSON
when O
I O
want O
to O
see O
you O

" O
She O
sighed O
heavily O
. O
" O
Mary S-PERSON
! O
Mary S-PERSON
! O
I O
cannot O
leave O
you O

You O

coldly O
as O

we O
were O
to O
be O
nought O
to O
each O

And O
my O
heart's O
bound O
up O
in O
you O
. O
I O
know O
why O
you O
bid O
me O
keep O
away O
, O
but O
— O
" O
She O
put O
her O
hand O
on O
his O
arm O
, O
as O
he O
spoke O
in O
a O
loud O
agitated O
tone O
| | O
she O
looked O
into O
his O
face O
with O
upbraiding O
love O
in O
her O
eyes O
, O
and O
then O
she O
said O
, O
while O
her O
lips O
quivered O
, O
and O
he O
felt O
her O
whole O
frame O
trembling O
: O
" O
Dear O
Jem S-PERSON
! O
I O
often O
could O
have O
told O
you O
more O
of O
love O
, O
if O
I O
had O
not O
once O
spoken O
out O
so O
free O
. O
Remember O
that O
time O
, O
Jem S-PERSON
, O
if O
ever O
you O
think O
me O
cold O
. O
Then O
, O
the O
love O
that's O
in O
my O
heart O
would O
out O
in O
words O

but O
now O
, O
though O
I'm O
silent O
on O
the O
pain O
I'm O
feeling O
in O
quitting O
you O
, O
the O
love O
is O
in O
my O
heart O
all O
the O
same O
. O
But O
this O
is O
not O
the O
time O
to O
speak O
on O
such O
things O
. O
If O
I O
do O
not O
do O
what O
I O
feel O
to O
be O
right O
now O
, O
I O
may O
blame O
myself O
all O
my O
life O
long O
! O
Jem S-PERSON
, O
you O
promised O
— O
" O
And O
so O
saying O
she O
left O
him O
. O
She O
went O
quicker O
than O
she O
would O
otherwise O
have O
passed O
over O
those O
few O
yards O
of O
ground O
, O
for O
fear O
he O
should O
still O
try O
to O
accompany O
her O
. O
Her O
hand O
was O
on O
the O
latch O
, O
and O
in O
a O
breath O
the O
door O
was O
opened O
. O
There O
sat O
her O
father O
, O
still O
and O
motionless O
— O
not O
even O
turning O
his O
head O
to O
see O
who O
had O
entered O
| | O
but O
perhaps O
he O
recognised O
the O
foot O
- O
step O
, O
— O
the O
trick O
of O
action O
. O
He O
sat O
by O
the O
fire O
| | O
the O
grate O
I O
should O
say O
, O
for O
fire O
there O
was O
none O
. O
Some O
dull O
, O
gray O
ashes O
, O
negligently O
left O
, O
long B-DATE
days I-DATE
ago E-DATE
, O
coldly O
choked O
up O
the O
bars O
. O
He O
had O
taken O
the O
accustomed O
seat O
from O
mere O
force O
of O
habit O
, O
which O
ruled O
his O
automaton O
- O
body O
. O
For O
all O
energy O
, O
both O
physical O
and O
mental O
, O
seemed O
to O
have O
retreated O
inwards O
to O
some O
of O
the O
great O
citadels O
of O
life O
, O
there O
to O
do O
battle O
against O
the O
Destroyer S-PRODUCT
, O
Conscience O
. O
His O
hands O
were O
crossed O
, O
his O
fingers O
interlaced O
| | O
usually O
a O
position O
implying O
some O
degree O
of O
resolution O
, O
or O
strength O
| | O
but O
in O
him O
it O
was O
so O
faintly O
maintained O
, O
that O
it O
appeared O
more O
the O
result O
of O
chance O
| | O
an O
attitude O
requiring O
some O
application O
of O
outward O
force O
to O
alter O
, O
— O
and O
a O
blow O
with O
a O
straw O
seemed O
as O
though O
it O
would O
be O
sufficient O
. O
And O
as O
for O
his O
face O
, O
it O
was O
sunk O
and O
worn O
, O
— O
like O
a O
skull O
, O
with O
yet O
a O
suffering O
expression O
that O
skulls O
have O
not O
! O
Your O
heart O
would O
have O
ached O
to O
have O
seen O
the O
man O
, O
however O
hardly O
you O
might O
have O
judged O
his O
crime O
. O
But O
crime O
and O
all O
was O
forgotten O
by O
his O
daughter O
, O
as O
she O
saw O
his O
abashed O
look O
, O
his O
smitten O
helplessness O
. O
All O
along O
she O
had O
felt O
it O
difficult O
( O
as O
I O
may O
have O
said O
before O
) O
to O
reconcile O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
ideas O
, O
of O
her O
father O
and O
a O
blood O
- O
shedder O
. O
But O
now O
it O
was O
impossible O
. O
He O
was O
her O
father O
! O
her O
own O
dear O
father O
! O
and O
in O
his O
sufferings O
, O
whatever O
their O
cause O
, O
more O
dearly O
loved O
than O
ever O
before O
. O
His O
crime O
was O
a O
thing O
apart O
, O
never O
more O
to O
be O
considered O
by O
her O
. O
And O
tenderly O
did O
she O
treat O
him O
, O
and O
fondly O
did O
she O
serve O
him O
in O
every O
way O
that O
heart O
could O
devise O
, O
or O
hand O
execute O
. O
She O
had O
some O
money O
about O
her O
, O
the O
price O
of O
her O
strange O
services O
as O
a O
witness O
| | O
and O
when O
the O
lingering O
dusk O
drew O
on O
, O
she O
stole O
out O
to O
effect O
some O
purchases O
necessary O
for O
her O
father's O
comfort O
. O
For O
how O
body O
and O
soul O
had O
been O
kept O
together O
, O
even O
as O
much O
as O
they O
were O
, O
during O
the O
days O
he O
had O
dwelt O
alone O
, O
no O
one O
can O
say O
. O
The O
house O
was O
bare O
as O
when O
Mary S-PERSON
had O
left O
it O
, O
of O
coal O
, O
or O
of O
candle O
, O
of O
food O
, O
or O
of O
blessing O
in O
any O
shape O
. O
She O
came O
quickly O
home O
| | O
but O
as O
she O
passed O
Job O
Legh's O
door O
, O
she O
stopped O
. O
Doubtless O
Jem S-PERSON
had O
long O
since O
gone O
| | O
and O
doubtless O
, O
too O
, O
he O
had O
given O
Margaret S-PERSON
some O
good O
reason O
for O
not O
intruding O
upon O
her O
friend O
for O
this O
night O
at O
least O
, O
otherwise O
Mary S-PERSON
would O
have O
seen O
her O
before O
now O
. O
But O
to O
- O
morrow O
, O
— O
would O
she O
not O
come O
in O
to O
- O
morrow O
? O
And O
who O
so O
quick O
as O
blind O
Margaret S-PERSON
in O
noticing O
tones O
, O
and O
sighs O
, O
and O
even O
silence O
? O
She O
did O
not O
give O
herself O
time O
for O
further O
thought O
, O
her O
desire O
to O
be O
once O
more O
with O
her O
father O
was O
too O
pressing O

but O
she O
opened O
the O
door O
, O
before O
she O
well O
knew O
what O
to O
say O

joy O
at O
meeting O
her O

the O
open O

of O
her O
love O

affected O
Mary S-PERSON
much O

she O
could O
not O
keep O
from O
crying O
, O
and O
sat O
down O
weak O
and O
agitated O
on O
the O

could O
find O

Margaret S-PERSON
held O
her O
hand O
, O
and O
gently O
smiled O
into O
her O
face O
. O
Job B-PERSON
Legh E-PERSON
took O
the O
candle O
up O
, O
and O
began O
a O
leisurely O
inspection O

had O
sickened O
at O
the O
mention O

said O

" O
For O
Job O
was O
muttering O
away O
in O
high O
dudgeon O
, O
and O
even O
Margaret's S-PERSON
tone O
was O
altered O
as O
she O
wished O
Mary S-PERSON
good O
night O
. O
Just O
then O
she O
could O
ill O
brook O
coldness O
from O
any O
one O
, O
and O
least O
of O
all O
bear O
the O
idea O
of O
being O
considered O
ungrateful O
by O
so O
kind O
and O
zealous O
a O
friend O
as O
Job O
had O
been O

so O
she O
turned O
round O
suddenly O
, O
even O
when O
her O
hand O
was O
on O
the O
latch O
of O
the O
door O
, O
and O
ran O
back O
, O
and O
threw O
her O
arms O
about O
his O
neck O
, O
and O
kissed O
him O
first S-ORDINAL
, O

then O
Margaret S-PERSON
. O
And O
then O
, O
the O
tears O
fast O
- O
falling O
down O
her O
cheeks O
, O
but O
no O
word O
spoken O

she O
hastily O
left O
the O
house O

went O
back O

her O
home O

There O
was O
no O
change O
in O
her O
father's O
position O

in O
his O
spectral O
look O

He O
had O
answered O
her O
questions O
( O
but O
few O
in O
number O
, O
for O
so O
many O
subjects O
were O
unapproachable O
) O
by O
monosyllables O
, O
and O
in O
a O
weak O
, O
high O
, O
childish O
voice O

but O
he O
had O
not O
lifted O
his O
eyes O

he O
could O
not O
meet O
his O
daughter's O
look O

And O
she O
, O
when O
she O
spoke O
, O
or O
as O
she O
moved O
about O
, O
avoided O
letting O
her O
eyes O
rest O
upon O
him O
. O
She O
wished O
to O
be O
her O
usual O
self O

but O
while O
every O
thing O
was O
done O
with O
a O
consciousness O
of O
purpose O
, O
she O
felt O
it O
was O
impossible O

In O
this O
manner O
things O
went O
on O
for O
some B-DATE
days E-DATE
. O
At O
night O
he O
feebly O
clambered O
up O
stairs O
to O
bed O
| | O
and O
during O
those O
long O
dark O
hours O
Mary S-PERSON
heard O
those O
groans O
of O
agony O
which O
never O
escaped O
his O
lips O
by O
day O
, O
when O
they O
were O
compressed O
in O
silence O
over O
his O
inward O
woe O
. O
Many O
a O
time O
she O
sat O
up O
listening O
, O
and O
wondering O
if O
it O
would O
ease O
his O
miserable O
heart O
if O
she O
went O
to O
him O
, O
and O
told O
him O
she O
knew O
all O
, O
and O
loved O
and O
pitied O
him O
more O
than O
words O
could O
tell O
. O
By O
day O
the O
monotonous O
hours O
wore O
on O
in O
the O
same O
heavy O
, O
hushed O
manner O
as O
on O
that O
first S-ORDINAL
dreary O
afternoon O
. O
He O
ate O
, O
— O
but O
without O
relish O

and O
food O
seemed O
no O
longer O
to O
nourish O
him O
, O
for O
each O
morning O
his O
face O
had O
caught O
more O
of O
the O
ghastly O
fore O
- O
shadowing O
of O
Death O
. O
The O
neighbours O
kept O
strangely O
aloof O
. O
Of O
late B-DATE
years E-DATE
John B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
had O
had O
a O
repellent O
power O
about O
him O
, O
felt O
by O
all O
, O
except O
to O
the O
few O
who O
had O
either O
known O
him O
in O
his O
better O
and O
happier O
days O
, O
or O
those O
to O
whom O
he O
had O
given O
his O
sympathy O
and O
his O
confidence O
. O
People O
did O
not O
care O
to O
enter O
the O
doors O
of O
one O
whose O
very O
depth O
of O
thoughtfulness O
rendered O
him O
moody O
and O
stern O
. O
And O
now O
they O
contented O
themselves O
with O
a O
kind O
inquiry O
when O
they O
saw O
Mary S-PERSON
in O
her O
goings O
- O
out O
or O
in O
her O
comings O
- O
in O
. O
With O
her O
oppressing O
knowledge O
, O
she O
imagined O
their O
reserved O
conduct O
stranger O
than O
it O
was O
in O
reality O
. O
She O
missed O
Job S-PERSON
and O
Margaret S-PERSON
too O
| | O
who O
, O
in O
all O
former O
times O
of O
sorrow O
or O
anxiety O
since O
their O
acquaintance O
first S-ORDINAL
began O
, O
had O
been O
ready O
with O
their O
sympathy O
. O
But O
most O
of O
all O
she O
missed O
the O
delicious O
luxury O
she O
had O
lately O
enjoyed O
in O
having O
Jem's S-PERSON
tender O
love O
at O
hand O
every O
hour O
of O
the O
day O
, O
to O
ward O
off O
every O
wind O
of O
heaven O
, O
and O
every O
disturbing O
thought O
. O
She O
knew O
he O
was O
often O
hovering O
about O
the O
house O
| | O
though O
the O
knowledge O
seemed O
to O
come O
more O
by O
intuition O
, O
than O
by O
any O
positive O
sight O
or O
sound O
for O
the B-DATE
first I-DATE
day E-DATE
or O
two S-CARDINAL
. O
On O
the B-DATE
third I-DATE
day E-DATE
she O
met O
him O
at O
Job B-ORG
Legh's E-ORG
. O
They O
received O
her O
with O
every O
effort O
of O
cordiality O
| | O
but O
still O
there O
was O
a O
cobweb O
- O
veil O
of O
separation O
between O
them O
, O
to O
which O
Mary S-PERSON
was O
morbidly O
acute O
| | O
while O
in O
Jem's S-PERSON
voice O
, O
and O
eyes O
, O
and O
manner O
, O
there O
was O
every O
evidence O
of O
most O
passionate O
, O
most O
admiring O
, O
and O
most O
trusting O
love O
. O
The O
trust O
was O
shown O
by O
his O
respectful O
silence O
on O
that O
one S-CARDINAL
point O
of O
reserve O
on O
which O
she O
had O
interdicted O
conversation O
. O
He O
left O
Job B-ORG
Legh's E-ORG
house O
when O
she O
did O
. O
They O
lingered O
on O
the O
step O
, O
he O
holding O
her O
hand O
between O
both O
of O
his O
, O
as O
loth O
to O
let O
her O
go O

he O
questioned O
her O
as O
to O
when O
he O
should O
see O
her O
again O
. O
" O
Mother O
does O
so O
want O
to O
see O
you O
, O
" O
whispered O
he O
. O
" O
Can O
you O
come O

her O
to O

morrow O
? O

when O

" O
" O
I O
cannot O

she O
, O
softly O

" O
Not O

Wait O
awhile O

perhaps O
only O
a O
little O
while O

I O

go O
to O
him O

" O
The O
next O
day O
, O
the O
fourth S-ORDINAL
from O
Mary's S-PERSON
return O
home O
, O
as O
she O
was O
sitting O
near O
the O
window O
, O
sadly O
dreaming O
over O
some O
work O
, O
she O
caught O
a O
glimpse O
of O
the O
last O
person O
she O
wished O
to O
see O
— O
of O
Sally B-PERSON
Leadbitter E-PERSON
! O
She O
was O
evidently O
coming O
to O
their O
house O
| | O
another O
moment O
, O
and O
she O
tapped O
at O
the O
door O
. O
John B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
gave O
an O
anxious O
, O
uneasy O
side O
- O
glance O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
knew O
that O
if O
she O
delayed O
answering O
the O
knock O
, O
Sally S-PERSON
would O
not O
scruple O
to O
enter O
| | O
so O
as O
hastily O
as O
if O
the O
visit O
had O
been O
desired O
, O
she O
opened O
the O
door O
, O
and O
stood O
there O
with O
the O
latch O
in O
her O
hand O
, O
barring O
up O
all O
entrance O
, O
and O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
obstructing O
all O
curious O
glances O
into O
the O
interior O
. O
" O
Well O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
! O
You're O
home O
at O
last O
! O
I O
heard O
you'd O
getten O
home O

so O
I O
thought O
I'd O
just O
step O
over O
and O
hear O
the O
news O
. O
" O
She O
was O
bent O
on O
coming O
in O
, O
and O
saw O
Mary's S-PERSON
preventive O
design O
. O
So O
she O
stood O
on O
tip O
- O
toe O
, O
looking O
over O
Mary's S-PERSON
shoulders O
into O
the O
room O
where O
she O
suspected O
a O
lover O
to O
be O
lurking O
| | O
but O
instead O
, O
she O
saw O
only O
the O
figure O
of O
the O
stern O
, O
gloomy O
father O
she O
had O
always O
been O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
avoiding O

and O
she O
dropped O
down O
again O
, O
content O
to O
carry O
on O
the O
conversation O
where O
Mary S-PERSON
chose O
, O
and O
as O
Mary S-PERSON
chose O
, O
in O
whispers O

" O
So O
the O
old O
governor O
is O
back O
again O

it's O
all O

" O
Mary S-PERSON
gave O
a O
low O
moan O
, O
— O
and O
then O
implored O
Sally S-PERSON
to O
change O
the O
subject O
| | O
for O
unpleasant O
as O
it O
always O
was O
, O
it O
was O
doubly O
unpleasant O
in O
the O
manner O
in O
which O
she O
was O
treating O
it O
. O
If O
they O
had O
been O
alone O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
would O
have O
borne O
it O
patiently O
, O
— O
or O
so O
she O
thought O

— O
but O
now O
she O
felt O
almost O
certain O
her O
father O

listening O

there O
was O
a O
subdued O
breathing O

a O
slight O
bracing O

up O
of O
the O
listless O
attitude O

But O
there O
was O
no O
arresting O
Sally's S-PERSON
curiosity O
to O
hear O
all O
she O
could O
respecting O
the O
adventures O
Mary S-PERSON

in O
common O
with O
the O
rest O
of O
Miss O
Simmonds' S-PERSON
young O
ladies O
, O
was O
almost O
jealous O
of O
the O
fame O

such O

smiling O
at O

so O
wildly O
incongruous O

of O
looking O
out O

by O
the O

she O
gave O
me O
a O

a O

with O
an O

" O

said O
he O
, O
with O
fond O
exaggeration O
of O
her O
helplessness O
. O
Yet O
a O
little O
more O
lovers' O
loitering O

a O
few O
more O
words O
, O
in O
themselves O
nothing O

to O
you O
nothing O

but O
to O
those O
two S-CARDINAL
what O
tender O
passionate O
language O
can O
I O
use O
to O
express O
the O
feelings O
which O
thrilled O
through O
that O
young O
man O
and O
maiden O
, O
as O
they O
listened O
to O
the O
syllables O
made O
dear O
and O
lovely O
through O
life O
by O
that O
hour's O
low O
- O
whispered O
talk O
. O
It O
struck O
the B-TIME
half I-TIME
hour I-TIME
past I-TIME
seven E-TIME
. O
" O
Come O
and O
speak O
to O
mother O

she O
knows O
you're O
to O
be O
her O
daughter O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
darling O
. O
" O
So O
they O
went O
in O
. O
Jane B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
was O
rather O
chafed O
at O
her O
son's O
delay O
in O
returning O
home O
, O
for O
as O
yet O
he O
had O
managed O
to O
keep O
her O
in O
ignorance O
of O
his O
dismissal O
from O
the O
foundry O
| | O
and O
it O
was O
her O
way O
to O
prepare O
some O
little O
pleasure O
, O
some O
little O
comfort O
for O
those O
she O
loved O

and O
if O
they O
, O
unwittingly O
, O
did O
not O
appear O
at O
the O
proper O
time O
to O
enjoy O
her O
preparation O
, O
she O
worked O
herself O
up O
into O
a O
state O
of O
fretfulness O
which O
found O
vent O
in O
upbraidings O
as O
soon O
as O
ever O
the O
objects O
of O
her O
care O
appeared O
, O
thereby O
marring O
the O
peace O
which O
should O
ever O
be O
the O
atmosphere O
of O
a O
home O
, O
however O
humble O

and O
causing O
a O
feeling O
almost O
amounting O
to O
loathing O
to O
arise O
at O
the O
sight O
of O
the O
" O
stalled O
ox O
, O
" O
which O
, O
though O
an O
effect O
and O
proof O
of O
careful O
love O
, O
has O
been O
the O
cause O
of O
so O
much O
disturbance O
. O
Mrs. O
Wilson S-PERSON
had O
first S-ORDINAL
sighed O
, O
and O
then O
grumbled O
to O
herself O
, O
over O
the O
increasing O
toughness O
of O
the O
potato O
- O
cakes O
she O
had O
made O
for O
her O
son's O
tea O
. O
The O
door O
opened O
, O
and O
he O
came O
in O
| | O
his O
face O
brightening O
into O
proud O
smiles O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
hanging O
on O
his O
arm O
, O
blushing O
and O
dimpling O
, O
with O
eye O
- O
lids O
veiling O
the O
happy O
light O
of O
her O
eyes O
, O
— O
there O
was O
around O
the O
young O
couple O
a O
radiant O
atmosphere O
— O
a O
glory O
of O
happiness O
. O
Could O
his O
mother O
mar O
it O
? O
Could O
she O
break O
into O
it O
with O
her O
Martha S-PERSON
- O
like O
cares O
? O
Only O
for O
one S-CARDINAL
moment O
did O
she O
remember O
her O
sense O
of O
injury O
, O
— O
her O
wasted O
trouble O
, O
— O
and O
then O
, O
her O
whole O
woman's O
heart O
heaving O
with O
motherly O
love O
and O
sympathy O
, O
she O
opened O
her O
arms O
, O
and O
received O
Mary S-PERSON
into O
them O
, O
as O
, O
shedding O
tears O
of O
agitated O
joy O
, O
she O
murmured O
in O
her O
ear O
, O
" O
Bless O
thee O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
bless O
thee O
! O
Only O
make O
him O
happy O
, O
and O
God O
bless O
thee O
for O
ever O
! O
" O
It O
took O
some O
of O
Jem's S-PERSON
self O
- O
command O
to O
separate O
those O
whom O
he O
so O
much O
loved O
, O
and O
who O
were O
beginning O
, O
for O
his O
sake O
, O
to O
love O
one O
another O
so O
dearly O
. O
But O
the O
time O
for O
his O
meeting O
John B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
drew O
on O
: O
and O
it O
was O
a O
long O
way O
to O
his O
house O
. O
As O
they O
walked O
briskly O
thither O
they O
hardly O
spoke O
| | O
though O
many O
thoughts O
were O
in O
their O
minds O
. O
The O
sun O
had O
not O
long O
set O
, O
but O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
faint O
shade O
of O
twilight O
was O
over O
all O
| | O
and O
when O
they O
opened O
the O
door O
, O
Jem S-PERSON
could O
hardly O
perceive O
the O
objects O
within O
by O
the O
waning O
light O
of O
day O
, O
and O
the O
flickering O
fire O
- O
blaze O
. O
But O
Mary S-PERSON
saw O
all O
at O
a O
glance O
! O
Her O
eye O
, O
accustomed O
to O
what O
was O
usual O
in O
the O
aspect O
of O
the O
room O
, O
saw O
instantly O
what O
was O
unusual O
, O
— O
saw O
, O
and O
understood O
it O
all O
. O
Her O
father O
was O
standing O
behind O
his O
habitual O
chair O
, O
holding O
by O
the O
back O
of O
it O
as O
if O
for O
support O
. O
And O
opposite O
to O
him O
there O
stood O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
| | O
the O
dark O
out O
- O
line O
of O
his O
stern O
figure O
looming O
large O
against O
the O
light O
of O
the O
fire O
in O
that O
little O
room O
. O
Behind O
her O
father O
sat O
Job B-PERSON
Legh E-PERSON
, O
his O
head O
in O
his O
hands O
, O
and O
resting O
his O
elbows O
on O
the O
little O
family O
table O
, O
— O
listening O
evidently O
| | O
but O
as O
evidently O
deeply O
affected O
by O
what O
he O
heard O
. O
There O
seemed O
to O
be O
some O
pause O
in O
the O
conversation O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
and O
Jem S-PERSON
stood O
at O
the O
half O
- O
open O
door O
, O
not O
daring O
to O
stir O
| | O
hardly O
to O
breathe O
. O
" O
And O
have O
I O
heard O
you O
aright O
? O
" O
began O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
, O
with O
his O
deep O
quivering O
voice O
. O
" O
Man O
! O
have O
I O
heard O
you O
aright O
? O
Was O
it O
you O
, O
then O
, O
that O
killed O
my O
boy O
? O
my O
only O
son O
? O
" O
— O
( O
he O
said O
these O
last O
few O
words O
almost O
as O
if O
appealing O
for O
pity O
, O
and O
then O
he O
changed O
his O
tone O
to O
one O
more O
vehement O
and O
fierce O
) O
. O
" O
Don't S-PERSON
dare O
to O
think O
that O
I O
shall O
be O
merciful O
, O
and O
spare O
you O
, O
because O
you O
have O
come O
forward O
to O
accuse O
yourself O
. O
I O
tell O
you O
I O
will O
not O
spare O
you O
the O
least O
pang O
the O
law O
can O
inflict O
, O
— O
you O
, O
who O
did O
not O
show O
pity O
on O
my O
boy O
, O
shall O
have O
none O
from O
me O
. O
" O
" O
I O
did O
not O
ask O
for O
any O
, O
" O
said O
John B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
low O
voice O
. O
" O
Ask O
, O
or O
not O
ask O
, O
what O
care O
I O
? O
You O
shall O
be O
hanged O
— O
hanged O
— O
man O
! O
" O
said O
he O
, O
advancing O
his O
face O
, O
and O
repeating O
the O
word O
with O
slow O
, O
grinding O
emphasis O
, O
as O
if O
to O
infuse O
some O
of O
the O
bitterness O
of O
his O
soul O
into O
it O
. O
John B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
gasped O
, O
but O
not O
with O
fear O
. O
It O
was O
only O
that O
he O
felt O
it O
terrible O
to O
have O
inspired O
such O
hatred O
, O
as O
was O
concentrated O
into O
every O
word O
, O
every O
gesture O
of O
Mr. O
Carson's S-PERSON
. O
" O
As O
for O
being O
hanged O
, O
sir O

I O
know O
it's O
all O
right O

proper O

I O
dare O
say O
it's O
bad O
enough O

I O
tell O
you O
what O

speaking O
with O
an O
out O

burst O

you'd O
hanged O
me O
the O
day O
after O
I'd O
done O
the O
deed O

I O
would O
have O
gone O
down O

such O

life O

I've O
been O
leading O
this O
fortnight O
past O

at O
best O
is O
no O
great O
thing O

such O
a O
life O
as O
I O
have O
dragged O
through O
since O
that O
night O
, O
" O
he O
shuddered O
at O
the O
thought O
. O
" O
Why O
, O
sir O
, O
I've O
been O
on O
the O
point O
of O
killing O
myself O
this O
many O

time O

get O
away O
from O
my O

thoughts O

I O
didn't O

I'll O
tell O
you O
why O

I O
didn't O
know O

that O
I O
should O
be O
more O
haunted O
than O
ever O
with O
the O
recollection O
of O
my O
sin O

Oh O
! O
God O
above O
only O
can O
tell O
the O
agony O
with O
which O
I've O
repented O
me O
of O
it O
, O
and O
part O
perhaps O
because O
I O
feared O

would O
think O

were O
impatient O
of O
the O
misery O
He O
sent O
as O
punishment O

far O

far O
worse O
misery O
than O
any O

He O
ceased O
from O
excess O
of O
emotion O

he O
began O
again O

it O
may O
be O
very O
wicked O

it's O
the O
truth O

I've O
kept O

His O
exhaustion O
compelled O
him O
to O
sit O
down O

Mary S-PERSON
rushed O
to O
him O

seemed O

him O

" O
John S-PERSON
himself O
stood O
up O
, O
stiff O
and O
rigid O
, O
and O
replied O
, O
" O
Mary S-PERSON

wench O

I O
owe O
him O

I O

Thou O

said O
true O

I O
am O
standing O
side O
by O
side O

it O
matters O
little O
where O
I O
spend O
the O
bit O
of O
time O
left O
of O
Life O

That O
time O
I O
must O
pass O
in O
wrestling O
with O
my O
soul O
for O
a O
character O
to O
take O
into O
the O

go O
where O
you O

He's O
innocent O

" O
faintly O
indicating O
Jem S-PERSON
, O
as O
he O
fell O
back O
in O
his O
chair O
. O
" O
Never O
fear O
! O
They O
cannot O
touch O
him O
, O
" O
said O
Job B-PERSON
Legh E-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
low O
voice O
. O
But O
as O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
was O
on O
the O
point O
of O
leaving O
the O
house O
with O
no O
sign O
of O
relenting O
about O
him O
, O
he O
was O
again O
stopped O
by O
John B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
risen O
once O
more O
from O
his O
chair O
, O
and O
stood O
supporting O
himself O
on O
Jem S-PERSON
, O
while O
he O
spoke O
. O
" O
Sir O
, O
one S-CARDINAL
word O
! O
My O
hairs O
are O
gray O
with O
suffering O

yours O
with O
years O

" O
" O
And O
have O
I O
had O
no O
suffering O

" O
asked O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
, O
as O
if O
appealing O
for O
sympathy O
, O
even O
to O
the O
murderer O
of O
his O
child O
. O
And O
the O
murderer O
of O
his O
child O
answered O
to O
the O
appeal O
, O
and O
groaned O
in O
spirit O
over O
the O
anguish O
he O
had O
caused O
. O
" O
Have O
I O
had O
no O
inward O
suffering O

blanch O
these O
hairs O
? O
Have O
not O
I O
toiled O
and O
struggled O
even O
to O
these O
years O
with O
hopes O
in O
my O
heart O
that O
all O
centered O
in O
my O
boy O
? O
I O
did O
not O
speak O
of O
them O
, O
but O
were O
they O
not O
there O
? O
I O
seemed O
hard O

cold O

and O
so O
I O
might O
be O
to O
others O

not O
to O
him O

— O
who O
shall O
ever O
imagine O
the O
love O
I O
bore O
to O
him O
? O
Even O
he O
never O
dreamed O
how O
my O
heart O
leapt O
up O
at O
the O
sound O
of O
his O
footstep O
, O
and O
how O
precious O
he O
was O
to O
his O
poor O
old O
father O
. O
— O
And O
he O
is O
gone O
— O
killed O
— O
out O
of O
the O
hearing O
of O
all O
loving O
words O

out O
of O
my O
sight O
for O
ever O

was O
my O
sunshine O

now O
it O

night O
! O
Oh O
, O
my O
God! O
comfort O
me O
, O
comfort O
me O

" O
cried O
the O
old O
man O
aloud O
. O
The O
eyes O
of O
John B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
grew O
dim O
with O
tears O
. O
Rich O
and O
poor O
, O
masters O
and O
men O
, O
were O
then O
brothers O
in O
the O
deep O
suffering O
of O
the O
heart O

for O
was O
not O
this O
the O
very O
anguish O
he O
had O
felt O
for O
little O
Tom S-PERSON
, O
in O
years S-DATE
so O
long O
gone O
by O
that O
they O
seemed O
like O
another O
life O
! O
The O
mourner O
before O
him O
was O
no O

the O
employer O

of O
another O
race O

eternally O
placed O
in O
antagonistic O
attitude O

going O
through O
the O
world O
glittering O
like O
gold O
, O
with O
a O
stony O
heart O
within O
, O
which O
knew O
no O
sorrow O

through O
the O
accidents O
of O
Trade O

no O
longer O
the O
enemy O
, O
the O
oppressor O
, O
but O
a O
very O
poor O
and O
desolate O
old O
man O
. O
The O
sympathy O
for O
suffering O
, O
formerly O
so O
prevalent O
a O
feeling O
with O
him O
, O
again O
filled O
John B-PERSON
Barton's E-PERSON
heart O
, O
and O
almost O
impelled O
him O
to O
speak O
( O
as O
best O
he O
could O
) O
some O
earnest O
, O
tender O
words O
to O
the O
stern O
man O
, O
shaking O
in O
his O
agony O
. O
But O
who O
was O
he O
, O
that O
he O
should O
utter O
sympathy O
or O
consolation O
? O
The O
cause O
of O
all O
this O
woe O
. O
Oh O
blasting O
thought O
! O
Oh O
miserable O
remembrance O
! O
He O
had O
forfeited O
all O
right O
to O
bind O
up O
his O
brother's O
wounds O
. O
Stunned O
by O
the O
thought O
, O
he O
sank O
upon O
the O
seat O
, O
almost O
crushed O
with O
the O
knowledge O
of O
the O
consequences O
of O
his O
own O
action O

for O
he O
had O
no O
more O
imagined O
to O
himself O
the O
blighted O
home O
, O
and O
the O
miserable O
parents O
, O
than O
does O
the O
soldier O
, O
who O
discharges O
his O
musket O
, O
picture O
to O
himself O
the O
desolation O
of O
the O
wife O
, O
and O
the O
pitiful O
cries O
of O
the O
helpless O
little O
ones O
, O
who O
are O
in O
an O
instant O
to O
be O
made O
widowed O

fatherless O

To O
intimidate O
a O
class O
of O
men O
, O
known O
only O
to O
those O
below O
them O
as O
desirous O
to O
obtain O
the O
greatest O
quantity O
of O
work O
for O
the O
lowest O
wages O
, O
— O
at O
most O
to O
remove O
an O
overbearing O
partner O
from O
an O
obnoxious O
firm O
, O
who O
stood O
in O
the O
way O
of O
those O
who O
struggled O
as O
well O
as O
they O
were O
able O
to O
obtain O
their O
rights O
, O
— O
this O
was O
the O
light O
in O
which O
John B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
had O
viewed O
his O
deed O

and O
even O
so O
viewing O
it O
, O
after O
the O
excitement O
had O
passed O
away O
, O
the O
Avenger S-PRODUCT
, O
the O
sure O
Avenger S-PRODUCT
, O
had O
found O
him O
out O
. O
But O
now O
he O
knew O
that O
he O
had O
killed O
a O
man O
, O
and O
a O
brother O
, O
— O
now O
he O
knew O
that O
no O
good O
thing O
could O
come O
out O
of O
this O
evil O
, O
even O
to O
the O
sufferers O
whose O
cause O
he O
had O
so O
blindly O
espoused O
. O
He O
lay O
across O
the O
table O
, O
broken O
- O
hearted O
. O
Every O
fresh O
quivering O
sob O
of O
Mr. O
Carson's S-PERSON
stabbed O
him O
to O
his O
soul O
. O
He O
felt O
execrated O
by O
all O
| | O
and O
as O
if O
he O
could O
never O
lay O
bare O
the O
perverted O
reasonings O
which O
had O
made O
the O
performance O
of O
undoubted O
sin O
appear O
a O
duty O
. O
The O
longing O
to O
plead O
some O
faint O
excuse O
grew O
stronger O
and O
stronger O
. O
He O
feebly O
raised O
his O
head O
, O
and O
looking O
at O
Job B-PERSON
Legh E-PERSON
, O
he O
whispered O
out O
, O
" O
I O
did O
not O
know O
what O
I O
was O
doing O
, O
Job B-PERSON

| | O
God O
knows O
I O
didn't O
! O
Oh O
, O
sir O
! O
" O
said O
he O
wildly O
, O
almost O
throwing O
himself O
at O
Mr. O
Carson's S-PERSON
feet O
, O
" O
say O
you O
forgive O
me O
the O
anguish O
I O
now O
see O
I O
have O
caused O
you O

I O
care O
not O
for O
pain O

or O
death O

man O

forgive O
me O
the O
trespass O

" O
" O
Forgive O
us O
our O
trespasses O
as O
we O
forgive O
them O
that O
trespass O
against O
us O
, O
" O
said O
Job S-PERSON
, O
solemnly O
and O
low O
, O
as O
if O
in O
prayer O
| | O
as O
if O
the O
words O
were O
suggested O
by O
those O
John B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
had O
used O
. O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
took O
his O
hands O
away O
from O
his O
face O
. O
I O
would O
rather O
see O
death O
than O
the O
ghastly O
gloom O
which O
darkened O
that O
countenance O
. O
" O
Let O
my O
trespasses O
be O
unforgiven O

so O
that O
I O
may O
have O
vengeance O
for O
my O
son's O
murder O
. O
" O
There O
are O
blasphemous O
actions O
as O
well O
as O
blasphemous O
words O
: O
all O
unloving O
, O
cruel O
deeds O
are O
acted O
blasphemy O
. O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
left O
the O
house O
. O
And O
John B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
lay O
on O
the O
ground O
as O
one S-CARDINAL
dead O
. O
They O
lifted O
him O
up O
, O
and O
almost O
hoping O
that O
that O
deep O
trance O
might O
be O
to O
him O
the O
end O
of O
all O
earthly O
things O
, O
they O
bore O
him O
to O
his O
bed O
. O
For O
a O
time O
they O
listened O
with O
divided O
attention O
to O
his O
faint O
breathings O
| | O
for O
in O
each O
hasty O
hurried O
step O
that O
echoed O
in O
the O
street O
outside O
, O
they O
thought O
they O
heard O
the O
approach O
of O
the O
officers O
of O
justice O
. O
When O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
left O
the O
house O
he O
was O
dizzy O
with O
agitation O
| | O
the O
hot O
blood O
went O
careering O
through O
his O
frame O
. O
He O
could O
not O
see O
the O
deep O
blue O
of O
the O
night O
- O
heavens O
for O
the O
fierce O
pulses O
which O
throbbed O
in O
his O
head O
. O
And O
partly O
to O
steady O
and O
calm O
himself O
, O
he O
leaned O
against O
a O
railing O
, O
and O
looked O
up O
into O
those O
calm O
majestic O
depths O
with O
all O
their O
thousand S-CARDINAL
stars O
. O
And O
by O
- O
and O
- O
by O
his O
own O
voice O
returned O
upon O
him O
, O
as O
if O
the O
last O
words O
he O
had O
spoken O
were O
being O
uttered O
through O
all O
that O
infinite O
space O
| | O
but O
in O
their O
echoes O
there O
was O
a O
tone O
of O
unutterable O
sorrow O
. O
" O
Let O
my O
trespasses O
be O
unforgiven O
, O
so O
that O
I O
may O
have O
vengeance O
for O
my O
son's O
murder O
. O
" O
He O
tried O
to O
shake O
off O
the O
spiritual O
impression O
made O
by O
this O
imagination O
. O
He O
was O
feverish O
and O
ill O
, O
— O
and O
no O
wonder O
. O
So O
he O
turned O
to O
go O
homewards O
| | O
not O
, O
as O
he O
had O
threatened O
, O
to O
the O
police O
- O
office O
. O
After O
all O
( O
he O
told O
himself O
) O
, O
that O
would O
do O
in O
the O
morning O
. O
No O
fear O
of O
the O
man's O
escaping O
, O
unless O
he O
escaped O
to O
the O
grave O
. O
So O
he O
tried O
to O
banish O
the O
phantom O
voices O
and O
shapes O
which O
came O
unbidden O
to O
his O
brain O
, O
and O
to O
recall O
his O
balance O
of O
mind O
by O
walking O
calmly O
and O
slowly O
, O
and O
noticing O
every O
thing O
which O
struck O
his O
senses O
. O
It O
was O
a O
warm O
soft O
evening O
in O
spring O
, O
and O
there O
were O
many O
persons O
in O
the O
streets O
. O
Among O
others O
, O
a O
nurse O
with O
a O
little O
girl O
in O
her O
charge O
, O
conveying O
her O
home O
from O
some O
children's O
gaiety O
| | O
a O
dance O
most O
likely O
, O
for O
the O
lovely O
little O
creature O
was O
daintily O
decked O
out O
in O
soft O
, O
snowy O
muslin O
| | O
and O
her O
fairy O
feet O
tripped O
along O
by O
her O
nurse's O
side O
as O
if O
to O
the O
measure O
of O
some O
tune O
she O
had O
lately O
kept O
time O
to O
. O
Suddenly O
up O
behind O
her O
there O
came O
a O
rough O
, O
rude O
errand O
- O
boy O
, O
nine S-DATE
or O
ten B-DATE
years E-DATE
of O
age O
| | O
a O
giant O
he O
looked O
by O
the O
fairy O
- O
child O
, O
as O
she O
fluttered O
along O
. O
I O
don't O
know O
how O
it O
was O
, O
but O
in O
some O
awkward O
way O
he O
knocked O
the O
poor O
little O
girl O
down O
upon O
the O
hard O
pavement O
as O
he O
brushed O
rudely O
past O
, O
not O
much O
caring O
whom O
he O
hurt O
, O
so O
that O
he O
got O
along O
. O
The O
child O
arose O
sobbing O
with O
pain O

and O
not O
without O
cause O
, O
for O
blood O
was O
dropping O
down O
from O
the O
face O

a O
minute O
before O
so O
fair O
and O
bright O
— O
dropping O
down O
on O
the O
pretty O
frock O
, O
making O
those O
scarlet O
marks O
so O
terrible O
to O
little O
children O
. O
The O
nurse O
, O
a O
powerful O
woman O
, O
had O
seized O
the O
boy O
, O
just O
as O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
( O
who O
had O
seen O
the O
whole O
transaction O
) O
came O
up O
. O
" O
You O
naughty O
little O
rascal O
! O
I'll O
give O
you O
to O
a O
policeman O
, O
that O
I O
will O
! O
Do O
you O
see O
how O
you've O
hurt O
the O
little O
girl O
? O
Do O
you O
? O
" O
accompanying O
every O
sentence O
with O
a O
violent O
jerk O
of O
passionate O
anger O
. O
The O
lad O
looked O
hard O
and O
defying O
| | O
but O
withal O
terrified O
at O
the O
threat O
of O
the O
policeman O
, O
those O
ogres O
of O
our O
streets O
to O
all O
unlucky O
urchins O
. O
The O
nurse O
saw O
it O
, O
and O
began O
to O
drag O
him O
along O
, O
with O
a O
view O
of O
making O
what O
she O
called O
" O
a O
wholesome O
impression O
. O
" O
His O
terror O
increased O
, O
and O
with O
it O
his O
irritation O
| | O
when O
the O
little O
sweet O
face O
, O
choking O
away O
its O
sobs O
, O
pulled O
down O
nurse's O
head O
and O
said O
, O
" O
Please O
, O
dear O
nurse O
, O
I'm O
not O
much O
hurt O
| | O
it O
was O
very O
silly O
to O
cry O
, O
you O
know O
. O
He O
did O
not O
mean O
to O
do O
it O
. O
He O
did O
not O
know O
what O
he O
was O
doing O
, O
did O
you O
, O
little O
boy O
? O
Nurse O
won't O
call O
a O
policeman O
, O
so O
don't O
be O
frightened O
. O
" O
And O
she O
put O
up O
her O
little O
mouth O
to O
be O
kissed O
by O
her O
injurer O
, O
just O
as O
she O
had O
been O
taught O
to O
do O
at O
home O
to O
" O
make O
peace O

" O
" O
That O
lad O
will O
mind O
, O
and O
be O
more O
gentle O
for O
the O
time O
to O
come O
, O
I'll O
be O
bound O
, O
thanks O
to O
that O
little O
lady O
, O
" O
said O
a O
passer O
- O
by O
, O
half O
to O
himself O
, O
and O
half O
to O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
, O
whom O
he O
had O
observed O
to O
notice O
the O
scene O
. O
The O
latter O
took O
no O
apparent O
heed O
of O
the O
remark O
, O
but O
passed O
on O
. O
But O
the O
child's O
pleading O
reminded O
him O
of O
the O
low O
, O
broken O
voice O
he O
had O
so O
lately O
heard O
, O
penitently O
and O
humbly O
urging O
the O
same O
extenuation O
of O
his O
great O
guilt O
. O
" O
I O
did O
not O
know O
what O
I O
was O
doing O
. O
" O
He O
had O
some O
association O
with O
those O
words O

he O
had O
heard O
, O
or O
read O
of O
that O
plea O
somewhere O
before O

Where O
was O
it O
? O
Could O
it O
be O
— O
? O
He O
would O
look O
when O
he O
got O
home O
. O
So O
when O
he O
entered O
his O
house O
he O
went O
straight O
and O
silently O
up O
- O
stairs O
to O
his O
library O

took O
down O

Thought O
upon O
thought O

recollection O
upon O
recollection O
came O
crowding O
in O

from O
the O
remembrance O

the O

day O

let O
the O
tears O
fall O
slowly O
on O
the O
spotless O
leaves O
. O
His O
son's O
murderer O
was O
discovered O

had O
confessed O
his O
guilt O

and O
yet O
( O
strange O
to O
say O
) O
he O
could O
not O
hate O
him O
with O
the O
vehemence O
of O
hatred O
he O
had O
felt O
, O
when O
he O
had O
imagined O
him O
a O
young O
man O
, O
full O
of O
lusty O
life O
, O
defying O
all O
laws O
, O
human O

divine O
. O
In O
spite O
of O
his O
desire O
to O
retain O
the O
revengeful O
feeling O
he O
considered O
as O
a O
duty O
to O
his O
dead O
son O
, O
something O
of O
pity O
would O
steal O
in O
for O
the O
poor O
, O
wasted O
skeleton O
of O
a O
man O
, O
the O
smitten O
creature O
, O
who O
had O
told O
him O
of O
his O
sin O
, O
and O
implored O
his O
pardon O
that O
night O
. O
In O
the O
days O
of O
his O
childhood O
and O
youth O
, O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
had O
been O
accustomed O
to O
poverty O

but O
it O
was O
honest O
, O
decent O
poverty O
| | O
not O
the O
grinding O
squalid O
misery O
he O
had O
remarked O
in O
every O
part O
of O
John B-PERSON
Barton's E-PERSON
house O
, O
and O
which O
contrasted O
strangely O
with O
the O
pompous O
sumptuousness O
of O
the O
room O
in O
which O
he O
now O
sat O
. O
Unaccustomed O
wonder O
filled O
his O
mind O
at O
the O
reflection O
of O
the O
different O
lots O
of O
the O
brethren O
of O
mankind O
. O
Then O
he O
roused O
himself O
from O
his O
reverie O
, O
and O
turned O
to O
the O
object O
of O
his O
search O
— O
the O
Gospel S-WORK_OF_ART
, O
where O
he O
half O
expected O
to O
find O
the O
tender O
pleading O
: O
" O
They O
know O
not O
what O
they O
do O
. O
" O
It O
was O
murk O
midnight O
by O
this O
time O
, O
and O
the O
house O
was O
still O
and O
quiet O
. O
There O
was O
nothing O
to O
interrupt O
the O
old O
man O
in O
his O
unwonted O
study O
. O
Years B-DATE
ago E-DATE
, O
the O
Gospel S-WORK_OF_ART
had O
been O
his O
task O
- O
book O
in O
learning O
to O
read O
. O
So O
many B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago E-DATE
, O
that O
he O
had O
become O
familiar O
with O
the O
events O
before O
he O
could O
comprehend O
the O
Spirit O
that O
made O
the O
Life O
. O
He O
fell O
to O
the O
narrative O
now O
afresh O
, O
with O
all O
the O
interest O
of O
a O
little O
child O
. O
He O
began O
at O
the O
beginning O
, O
and O
read O
on O
almost O
greedily O
, O
understanding O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
the O
full O
meaning O
of O
the O
story O
. O
He O
came O
to O
the O
end O
| | O
the O
awful O
End O
. O
And O
there O
were O
the O
haunting O
words O
of O
pleading O
. O
He O
shut O
the O
book O
, O
and O
thought O
deeply O
. O
All O
night O
long O
, O
the O
Archangel S-PERSON
combated O
with O
the O
Demon S-PERSON
. O
All O
night O
long O
, O
others O
watched O
by O
the O
bed O
of O
Death O
. O
John B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
had O
revived O
to O
fitful O
intelligence O
. O
He O
spoke O
at O
times O
with O
even O
something O
of O
his O
former O
energy O
| | O
and O
in O
the O
racy O
Lancashire S-GPE
dialect O
he O
had O
always O
used O
when O
speaking O
freely O
. O
" O
You O
see O
I've O
so O
often O
been O
hankering O
after O
the O
right O
way O
| | O
and O
it's O
a O
hard O
one O
for O
a O
poor O
man O
to O
find O
. O
At O
least O
it's O
been O
so O
to O
me O
. O
No O
one O
learned O
me O
, O
and O
no O
one O
telled O
me O
. O
When O
I O
was O
a O
little O
chap O
they O
taught O
me O
to O
read O
, O
and O
then O
they O
ne'er O
gave O
me O
no O
books O

only O
I O
heard O
say O
the O
Bible S-WORK_OF_ART
was O
a O
good O
book O
. O
So O
when O
I O
grew O
thoughtful O
, O
and O
puzzled O
, O
I O
took O
to O
it O
. O
But O
you'd O
never O
believe O
black O
was O
black O
, O
or O
night O
was O
night O
, O
when O
you O
saw O
all O
about O
you O
acting O
as O
if O
black O
was O
white O
, O
and O
night O
was O
day O
. O
It's O
not O
much O
I O
can O
say O
for O
myself O
in O
t'other O
world O
, O
God O
forgive O
me O

but O
I O
can O
say O
this O
, O
I O
would O
fain O
have O
gone O
after O
the O
Bible S-WORK_OF_ART
rules O
if O
I'd O
seen O
folk O
credit O
it O
| | O
they O
all O
spoke O
up O
for O
it O
, O
and O
went O
and O
did O
clean O
contrary O
. O
In O
those O
days O
I O
would O
ha O
' O
gone O
about O
wi O
' O
my O
Bible S-WORK_OF_ART
, O
like O
a O
little O
child O
, O
my O
finger O
in O
th' O
place O
, O
and O
asking O
the O
meaning O
of O
this O
or O
that O
text O
, O
and O
no O
one O
told O
me O
. O
Then O
I O
took O
out O
two S-CARDINAL
or O
three S-CARDINAL
texts O
as O
clear O
as O
glass O
, O
and O
I O
tried O
to O
do O
what O
they O
bid O
me O
do O
. O
But O
I O
don't O
know O
how O
it O
was O
| | O
masters O
and O
men O
, O
all O
alike O
cared O
no O
more O
for O
minding O
those O
texts O
, O
than O
I O
did O
for O
th' O
Lord O
Mayor O
of O
London S-GPE

so O
I O
grew O
to O
think O
it O
must O
be O
a O
sham O
put O
upon O
poor O
ignorant O
folk O

women O
, O
and O
such O
- O
like O
. O
" O
It O
was O
not O
long O
I O
tried O
to O
live O
Gospel O
- O
wise O
, O
but O
it O
was O
liker O
heaven O
than O
any O
other O
bit O
of O
earth O
has O
been O
. O
I'd O
old O
Alice S-PERSON
to O
strengthen O
me O

but O
every O
one O
else O
said O
, O
' O
Stand O
up O
for O
thy O
rights O

thou'lt O
never O

wife O

children O
never O
spoke O

their O
helplessness O
cried O
aloud O
, O
and O
I O
was O
driven O
to O
do O
as O
others O
did O
, O
— O

then O
Tom S-PERSON
died O

all O
about O

— O
I'm O
getting O
scant O
o' O
breath O
, O
and O
blind O
- O
like O
. O
" O
Then O
again O
he O
spoke O
, O
after O
some B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
of O
hushed O
silence O
. O
" O
All O
along O
it O
came O
natural O
to O
love O
folk O
, O
though O
now O
I O
am O
what O

me O

Gospel O

days O

afore O
my O
child O
died O
o' O
hunger O

I O
was O
tore O
in O
two S-CARDINAL
often O

between O
my O
sorrow O

" O
At O
last O
I O
gave O
it O
up O

from O

down O

down O

broken O

Job B-PERSON
Legh E-PERSON
had O
gone O
home O
like O
one O
struck O
down O
with O
the O
unexpected O
shock O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
and O
Jem S-PERSON
together O
waited O
the O
approach O
of O
death O

but O
as O
the O
final O
struggle O
drew O
on O
, O
and O
morning O
dawned O
, O
Jem S-PERSON
suggested O
some O
alleviation O
to O
the O
gasping O
breath O
, O
to O
purchase O
which O
he O
left O
the O
house O
in O
search O
of O
a O
druggist's O
shop O
, O
which O
should O
be O
open O
at O
that B-TIME
early I-TIME
hour E-TIME
. O
During O
his O
absence O
, O
Barton S-PERSON
grew O
worse O
| | O
he O
had O
fallen O
across O
the O
bed O
, O
and O
his O
breathing O
seemed O
almost O
stopped O
| | O
in O
vain O
did O
Mary S-PERSON
strive O
to O
raise O
him O
, O
her O
sorrow O
and O
exhaustion O
had O
rendered O
her O
too O
weak O
. O
So O
, O
on O
hearing O
some O
one O
enter O
the O
house O
- O
place O
below O
, O
she O
cried O
out O
for O
Jem S-PERSON
to O
come O
to O
her O
assistance O
. O
A O
step O
, O
which O
was O
not O
Jem's S-PERSON
, O
came O
up O
the O
stairs O
. O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
stood O
in O
the O
door O
- O
way O
. O
In O
one S-CARDINAL
instant O
he O
comprehended O
the O
case O
. O
He O
raised O
up O
the O
powerless O
frame O
| | O
and O
the O
departing O
soul O
looked O
out O
of O
the O
eyes O
with O
gratitude O
. O
He O
held O
the O
dying O
man O
propped O
in O
his O
arms O
. O
John B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
folded O
his O
hands O
as O
if O
in O
prayer O
. O
" O
Pray O
for O
us O
, O
" O
said O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
sinking O
on O
her O
knees O
, O
and O
forgetting O
in O
that B-TIME
solemn I-TIME
hour E-TIME
all O
that O
had O
divided O
her O
father O
and O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
. O
No O
other O
words O
could O
suggest O
themselves O
than O
some O
of O
those O
he O
had O
read O
only B-TIME
a I-TIME
few I-TIME
hours E-TIME
before O
. O
" O

be O
merciful O

" O
And O
when O
the O
words O
were O
said O
, O
John B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
lay O
a O
corpse O
in O
Mr. O
Carson's S-PERSON
arms O
. O
So O
ended O
the O
tragedy O
of O
a O
poor O
man's O
life O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
knew O
nothing O
more O
for O
many B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
. O
When O
she O
recovered O
consciousness O
, O
she O
found O
herself O
supported O
by O
Jem S-PERSON
on O
the O

Job O
and O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
were O
there O
, O
talking O
together O
lowly O
and O
solemnly O
. O
Then O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
bade O
farewell O
and O
left O
the O
house O

and O
Job S-PERSON
said O
aloud O
, O
but O
as O
if O
speaking O
to O
himself O
, O
" O

Byron S-PERSON

Although O
Mary S-PERSON
had O
hardly O
been O
conscious O
of O
her O
thoughts O
, O
and O
it O
had O
been O
more O
like O
a O
secret O
instinct O
informing O
her O
soul O
, O
than O
the O
result O
of O
any O
process O
of O
reasoning O
, O
she O
had O
felt O
for O
some O
time O
( O
ever O
since O
her O
return O
from O
Liverpool S-GPE
, O
in O
fact O
) O
, O
that O
for O
her O
father O
there O
was O
but O
one S-CARDINAL
thing O
to O
be O
desired O

anticipated O
, O
and O
that O
was O
death O

She O
had O
seen O
that O
Conscience O
had O
given O
the O
mortal O
wound O
to O
his O
earthly O
frame O

she O
did O
not O
dare O
to O
question O
of O
the O
infinite O
mercy O
of O
God O
, O
what O
the O
Future O
Life O
would O
be O
to O
him O
. O
Though O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
desolate O
and O
stunned O
by O
the O
blow O
which O
had O
fallen O
on O
herself O
, O
she O
was O
resigned O
and O
submissive O
as O
soon O
as O
she O
recovered O
strength O
enough O
to O
ponder O
and O
consider O
a O
little O

and O
you O
may O
be O
sure O
that O
no O
tenderness O
or O
love O
was O
wanting O
on O
Jem's S-PERSON
part O
, O
and O
no O
consideration O

sympathy O
on O
that O
of O
Job O

soothe O

comfort O
the O
girl O

now O
stood O
alone O
in O
the O
world O
as O
far O
as O
blood O
- O
relations O
were O
concerned O
. O
She O
did O
not O
ask O
or O
care O
to O
know O
what O
arrangements O
they O
were O
making O
in O
whispered O
tones O
with O
regard O
to O
the O
funeral O
. O
She O
put O
herself O
into O
their O
hands O
with O
the O
trust O
of O
a O
little O
child O
| | O
glad O
to O
be O
undisturbed O
in O
the O
reveries O
and O
remembrances O
which O
filled O
her O
eyes O
with O
tears O
, O
and O
caused O
them O
to O
fall O
quietly O
down O
her O
pale O
cheeks O
. O
It O
was O
the O
longest O
day O
she O
had O
ever O
known O
in O
her O
life O

every O
charge O
and O
every O
occupation O
was O
taken O
away O
from O
her O
: O
but O
perhaps O
the O
length O
of O
quiet O
time O
thus O
afforded O
was O
really O
good O
, O
although O
its O
duration O
weighed O
upon O
her O

for O
by O
this O
means O
she O
contemplated O
her O
situation O
in O
every O
light O
, O
and O
fully O
understood O
that O
the O
morning's O
event O
had O
left O
her O
an O
orphan O

and O
thus O
she O
was O
spared O
the O
pangs O
caused O
to O
us O
by O
the O
occurrence O
of O
death O
in O
the O
evening O
, O
just O
before O
we O
should O
naturally O
, O
in O
the O
usual O
course O
of O
events O
, O
lie O
down O
to O
slumber O

For O
in O
such O
case O
, O
worn O
out O
by O
anxiety O
, O
and O
it O
may O
be O
by O
much O
watching O
, O
our O
very O
excess O
of O
grief O
rocks O
itself O
to O
sleep O
, O
before O
we O
have O
had O
time O
to O
realise O
its O
cause O
| | O
and O
we O
waken O
, O
with O
a O
start O
of O
agony O
like O
a O
fresh O
stab O
, O
to O
the O
consciousness O
of O
the O
one S-CARDINAL
awful O
vacancy O
, O
which O
shall O
never O
, O
while O
the O
world O
endures O
, O
be O
filled O
again O
. O
The B-DATE
day E-DATE
brought O
its O
burden O
of O
duty O
to O
Mrs. O
Wilson S-PERSON
. O
She O
felt O
bound O
by O
regard O
, O
as O
well O
as O
by O
etiquette O
, O
to O
go O
and O
see O
her O
future O
daughter O
- O
in O
- O
law O
. O
And O
by O
an O
old O
association O
of O
ideas O
( O
perhaps O
of O
death O
with O
church O
- O
yards O
, O
and O
churches O
with O
Sunday S-DATE
) O
she O
thought O
it O
necessary O
to O
put O
on O
her O
best O
, O
and O
latterly O
unused O
clothes O
, O
the O
airing O
of O
which O
on O
a O
little O
clothes O
- O
horse O
before O
the O
fire O
seemed O
to O
give O
her O
a O
not O
unpleasing O
occupation O
. O
When O
Jem S-PERSON
returned O
home O
late B-TIME
in I-TIME
the I-TIME
evening E-TIME
succeeding O
John B-PERSON
Barton's E-PERSON
death O
, O
weary O
and O
oppressed O
with O
the O
occurrences O
and O
excitements O
of O
the O
day O
, O
he O
found O
his O
mother O
busy O
about O
her O
mourning O
, O
and O
much O
inclined O
to O
talk O
. O
Although O
he O
longed O
for O
quiet O
, O
he O
could O
not O
avoid O
sitting O
down O
and O
answering O
her O
questions O
. O
" O
Well O
, O
Jem S-PERSON
, O
he's O
gone O
at O
last O
, O
is O
he O
? O
" O
" O
Yes O
. O
How O
did O
you O
hear O
, O
mother O
? O
" O
" O
Oh O
, O
Job O
came O
over O
here O
and O
telled O
me O
, O
on O
his O
way O
to O
the O
undertaker's O
. O
Did O
he O
make O
a O
fine O
end O
? O
" O
It O
struck O
Jem S-PERSON
that O
she O
had O
not O
heard O
of O
the O
confession O
which O
had O
been O
made O
by O
John B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
on O
his O
death O
- O
bed O
| | O
he O
remembered O
Job B-PERSON
Legh's E-PERSON
discretion O
, O
and O
he O
determined O
that O
if O
it O
could O
be O
avoided O
his O
mother O
should O
never O
hear O
of O
it O
. O
Many O
of O
the O
difficulties O
to O
be O
anticipated O
in O
preserving O
the O
secret O
would O
be O
obviated O
, O
if O
he O
could O
induce O
his O
mother O
to O
fall O
into O
the O
plan O
he O
had O
named O
to O
Mary S-PERSON
of O
emigrating O
to O
Canada S-GPE
. O
The O
reasons O
which O
rendered O
this O
secrecy O
desirable O
related O
to O
the O
domestic O
happiness O
he O
hoped O
for O
. O
With O
his O
mother's O
irritable O
temper O
he O
could O
hardly O
expect O
that O
all O
allusion O
to O
the O
crime O
of O
John B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
would O
be O
for O
ever O
restrained O
from O
passing O
her O
lips O
, O
and O
he O
knew O
the O
deep O
trial O
such O
references O
would O
be O
to O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
Accordingly O
he O
resolved O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
in O
the O
morning O
to O
go O
to O
Job O
and O
beseech O
his O
silence O
| | O
he O
trusted O
that O
secrecy O
in O
that B-DATE
quarter E-DATE
, O
even O
if O
the O
knowledge O
had O
been O
extended O
to O
Margaret S-PERSON
, O
might O
be O
easily O
secured O
. O
But O
what O
would O
be O
Mr. O
Carson's S-PERSON
course O
? O
Were O
there O
any O
means O
by O
which O
he O
might O
be O
persuaded O
to O
spare O
John B-PERSON
Barton's E-PERSON
memory O
? O
He O
was O
roused O
up O
from O
this O
train O
of O
thought O
by O
his O
mother's O
more O
irritated O
tone O
of O
voice O
. O
" O
Jem S-PERSON

this O
talking O
to O
the O
solitude O

quiet O
of O
his O
own O
room O

seek O
an O

Jem S-PERSON
set O
off O
on O
his O
walk O

the O
works O

for O
so B-DATE
many I-DATE

his I-DATE
days E-DATE
had O
been O
spent O

where O
for O
so O
long O
a O
time O
his O
thoughts O
had O
been O
thought O
, O
his O
hopes O

fears O
experienced O
. O
It O
was O
not O
a O
cheering O
feeling O
to O
remember O
that O
henceforward O
he O
was O
to O
be O
severed O
from O
all O
these O
familiar O
places O

nor O
were O
his O
spirits O
enlivened O
by O
the O
evident O
feelings O
of O
the O
majority O
of O
those O
who O
had O
been O
his O
fellow O

As O
he O
stood O
in O
the O
entrance O
to O
the O
foundry O
, O
awaiting O
Mr. O
Duncombe's S-PERSON
leisure O
, O
many O
of O
those O
employed O
in O
the O
works O
passed O
him O
on O
their O
return O
from O
breakfast O

with O
one S-CARDINAL

two S-CARDINAL
exceptions O

without O
any O
acknowledgment O
of O
former O
acquaintance O

distant O
nod O
at O
the O
utmost O

" O
It O
is O
hard O

" O
said O
Jem S-PERSON
to O
himself O
, O
with O
a O
bitter O
and O
indignant O
feeling O
rising O
in O
his O
throat O
, O
" O

later O
the O

again O
this B-DATE

by O
Mary S-PERSON

before O
the O
latter O
she O
repressed O
her O
occasional O
nervous O
ill O
- O
humour O
till O
the O
habit O
of O
indulging O
it O
was O
perceptibly O
decreased O
. O
Years O
afterwards O
in O
conversation O
with O
Jem S-PERSON
, O
he O
was O
startled O
by O
a O
chance O
expression O
which O
dropped O
from O
his O
mother's O
lips O
| | O
it O
implied O
a O
knowledge O
of O
John B-PERSON
Barton's E-PERSON
crime O
. O
It O
was O
many O
a O
long O
day O
since O
they O
had O
seen O
any O
Manchester S-GPE
people O
who O
could O
have O
revealed O
the O
secret O
( O
if O
indeed O
it O
was O
known O
in O
Manchester S-GPE
, O
against O
which O
Jem S-PERSON
had O
guarded O
in O
every O
possible O
way O
) O
. O
And O
he O
was O
led O
to O
inquire O
first S-ORDINAL
as O
to O
the O
extent O
, O
and O
then O
as O
to O
the O
source O
of O
her O
knowledge O
. O
It O
was O
Mary S-PERSON
herself O
who O
had O
told O
all O
. O
For O
on O
the B-TIME
morning E-TIME
to O
which O
this O
chapter O
principally O
relates O
, O
as O
Mary S-PERSON
sat O
weeping O
, O
and O
as O
Mrs. O
Wilson S-PERSON
comforted O
her O
by O
every O
tenderest O
word O
and O
caress O
, O
she O
revealed O
to O
the O
dismayed O
and O
astonished O
Jane S-PERSON
, O
the O
sting O
of O
her O
deep O
sorrow O
| | O
the O
crime O
which O
stained O
her O
dead O
father's O
memory O
. O
She O
was O
quite O
unconscious O
that O
Jem S-PERSON
had O
kept O
it O
secret O
from O
his O
mother O
| | O
she O
had O
imagined O
it O
bruited O
abroad O
as O
the O
suspicion O
against O
her O
lover O
had O
been O
| | O
so O
word O
after O
word O
( O
dropped O
from O
her O
lips O
in O
the O
supposition O
that O
Mrs. O
Wilson S-PERSON
knew O
all O
) O
had O
told O
the O
tale O
and O
revealed O
the O
cause O
of O
her O
deep O
anguish O
| | O
deeper O
than O
is O
ever O
caused O
by O
Death O
alone O
. O
On O
large O
occasions O
like O
the O
present O
, O
Mrs. O
Wilson's S-PERSON
innate O
generosity O
came O
out O
. O
Her O
weak O
and O
ailing O
frame O
imparted O
its O
irritation O
to O
her O
conduct O
in O
small O
things O
, O
and O
daily O
trifles O
| | O
but O
she O
had O
deep O
and O
noble O
sympathy O
with O
great O
sorrows O
, O
and O
even O
at O
the O
time O
that O
Mary S-PERSON
spoke O
she O
allowed O
no O
expression O
of O
surprise O
or O
horror O
to O
escape O
her O
lips O
. O
She O
gave O
way O
to O
no O
curiosity O
as O
to O
the O
untold O
details O
| | O
she O
was O
as O
secret O
and O
trustworthy O
as O
her O
son O
himself O
| | O
and O
if O
in O
years S-DATE
to O
come O
her O
anger O
was O
occasionally O
excited O
against O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
and O
she O
, O
on O
rare O
occasions O
, O
yielded O
to O
ill O
- O
temper O
against O
her O
daughter O
- O
in O
- O
law O
, O
she O
would O
upbraid O
her O
for O
extravagance O
, O
or O
stinginess O
, O
or O
over O
- O
dressing O
, O
or O
under-dressing O
, O
or O
too O
much O
mirth O
or O
too O
much O
gloom O
, O
but O
never O
, O
never O
in O
her O
most O
uncontrolled O
moments O
did O
she O
allude O
to O
any O
one O
of O
the O
circumstances O
relating O
to O
Mary's S-PERSON
flirtation O
with O
Harry B-PERSON
Carson E-PERSON
, O
or O
his O
murderer O
| | O
and O
always O
when O
she O
spoke O
of O
John B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
, O
named O
him O
with O
the O
respect O
due O
to O
his O
conduct O
before O
the O
last O
, O
miserable O
, O
guilty O
month O
of O
his O
life O
. O
Therefore O
it O
came O
like O
a O
blow O
to O
Jem S-PERSON
when O
, O
after O
years O
had O
passed O
away O
, O
he O
gathered O
his O
mother's O
knowledge O
of O
the O
whole O
affair O
. O
From O
the O
day O
when O
he O
learnt O
( O
not O
without O
remorse O
) O
what O
hidden O
depths O
of O
self O
- O
restraint O
she O
had O
in O
her O
soul O
, O
his O
manner O
to O
her O
, O
always O
tender O
and O
respectful O
, O
became O
reverential O
| | O
and O
it O
was O
more O
than O
ever O
a O
loving O
strife O
between O
him O
and O
Mary S-PERSON
which O
should O
most O
contribute O
towards O
the O
happiness O
of O
the O
declining O
years O
of O
their O
mother O
. O
But O
I O
am O
speaking O
of O
the O
events O
which O
have O
occurred O
only O
lately O

The O

The O
Dream O
. O
" O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
stood O
at O
one O
of O
the O
breathing O
- O
moments O
of O
life O
. O
The O
object O
of O
the O
toils O
, O
the O
fears O
, O
and O
the O
wishes O
of O
his O
past O
years O
, O
was O
suddenly O
hidden O
from O
his O
sight O
, O
— O
vanished O
into O
the O
deep O
mystery O
which O
circumscribes O
existence O
. O
Nay S-PERSON
, O
even O
the O
vengeance O
which O
he O
had O
proposed O
to O
himself O
as O
an O
aim O
for O
exertion O
, O
had O
been O
taken O
away O
from O
before O
his O
eyes O
, O
as O
by O
the O
hand O
of O
God O
. O
Events O
like O
these O
would O
have O
startled O
the O
most O
thoughtless O
into O
reflection O
, O
much O
more O
such O
a O
man O
as O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
, O
whose O
mind O
, O
if O
not O
enlarged O
, O
was O
energetic O
| | O
indeed O
, O
whose O
very O
energy O
, O
having O
been O
hitherto O
the O
cause O
of O
the O
employment O
of O
his O
powers O
in O
only B-CARDINAL
one E-CARDINAL
direction O
, O
had O
prevented O
him O
from O
becoming O
largely O
and O
philosophically O
comprehensive O
in O
his O
views O
. O
But O
now O
the O
foundations O
of O
his O
past O
life O
were O
razed O
to O
the O
ground O
, O
and O
the O
place O
they O
had O
once O
occupied O
was O
sown O
with O
salt O
, O
to O
be O
for O
ever O
rebuilt O
no O
more O
. O
It O
was O
like O
the O
change O
from O
this O
Life O
to O
that O
other O
hidden O
one O
, O
when O
so O
many O
of O
the O
motives O
which O
have O
actuated O
all O
our O
earthly O
existence O
, O
will O
have O
become O
more O
fleeting O
than O
the O
shadows O
of O
a O
dream O
. O
With O
a O
wrench O
of O
his O
soul O
from O
the O
past O
, O
so O
much O
of O
which O
was O
as O
nothing O
, O
and O
worse O
than O
nothing O
to O
him O
now O
, O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
took O
some B-TIME
hours E-TIME
, O
after O
he O
had O
witnessed O
the O
death O
of O
his O
son's O
murderer O
, O
to O
consider O
his O
situation O
. O
But O
suddenly O
, O
while O
he O
was O
deliberating O
, O
and O
searching O
for O
motives O
which O
should O
be O
effective O
to O
compel O
him O
to O
exertion O
and O
action O
once O
more O
| | O
while O
he O
contemplated O
the O
desire O
after O
riches O
, O
social O
distinction O
, O
a O
name O
among O
the O
merchant O
- O
princes O
amidst O
whom O
he O
moved O
, O
and O
saw O
these O
false O
substances O
fade O
away O
into O
the O
shadows O
they O
truly O
are O
, O
and O
one S-CARDINAL
by O
one O
disappear O
into O
the O
grave O
of O
his O
son O
, O
— O
suddenly O
, O
I O
say O
, O
the O
thought O
arose O
within O
him O
that O
more O
yet O
remained O
to O
be O
learned O
about O
the O
circumstances O
and O
feelings O
which O
had O
prompted O
John B-PERSON
Barton's E-PERSON
crime O
| | O
and O
when O
once O
this O
mournful O
curiosity O
was O
excited O
, O
it O
seemed O
to O
gather O
strength O
in O
every O
moment O
that O
its O
gratification O
was O
delayed O
. O
Accordingly O
he O
sent O
a O
message O
to O
summon O
Job B-PERSON
Legh E-PERSON
and O
Jem B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
, O
from O
whom O
he O
promised O
himself O
some O
elucidation O
of O
what O
was O
as O
yet O
unexplained O
| | O
while O
he O
himself O
set O
forth O
to O
call O
on O
Mr. O
Bridgenorth S-PERSON
, O
whom O
he O
knew O
to O
have O
been O
Jem's S-PERSON
attorney O
, O
with O
a O
glimmering O
suspicion O
intruding O
on O
his O
mind O
, O
which O
he O
strove O
to O
repel O
, O
that O
Jem S-PERSON
might O
have O
had O
some O
share O
in O
his O
son's O
death O
. O
He O
had O
returned O
before O
his O
summoned O
visitors O
arrived O
| | O
and O
had O
time O
enough O
to O
recur O
to O
the O
evening O
on O
which O
John B-PERSON
Barton E-PERSON
had O
made O
his O
confession O
. O
He O
remembered O
with O
mortification O
how O
he O
had O
forgotten O
his O
proud O
reserve O
, O
and O
his O
habitual O
concealment O
of O
his O
feelings O
, O
and O
had O
laid O
bare O
his O
agony O
of O
grief O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
these O
two S-CARDINAL
men O
who O
were O
coming O
to O
see O
him O
by O
his O
desire O
| | O
and O
he O
entrenched O
himself O
behind O
stiff O
barriers O
of O
self O
- O
control O
, O
through O
which O
he O
hoped O
no O
appearance O
of O
emotion O
would O
force O
its O
way O
in O
the O
conversation O
he O
anticipated O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
when O
the O
servant O
announced O
that O
two S-CARDINAL
men O
were O
there O
by O
appointment O
to O
speak O
to O
him O
, O
and O
he O
had O
desired O
that O
they O
might O
be O
shown O
into O
the O
library O
where O
he O
sat O
, O
any O
watcher O
might O
have O
perceived O
by O
the O
trembling O
hands O
, O
and O
shaking O
head O
, O
not O
only O
how O
much O
he O
was O
aged O
by O
the O
occurrences O
of O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
few I-DATE
weeks E-DATE
, O
but O
also O
how O
much O
he O
was O
agitated O
at O
the O
thought O
of O
the O
impending O
interview O
. O
But O
he O
so O
far O
succeeded O
in O
commanding O
himself O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
, O
as O
to O
appear O
to O
Jem B-PERSON
Wilson E-PERSON
and O
Job B-PERSON
Legh E-PERSON
one O
of O
the O
hardest O
and O
most O
haughty O
men O
they O
had O
ever O
spoken O
to O
, O
and O
to O
forfeit O
all O
the O
interest O
which O
he O
had O
previously O
excited O
in O
their O
minds O
by O
his O
unreserved O
display O
of O
deep O
and O
genuine O
feeling O
. O
When O
he O
had O
desired O
them O
to O
be O
seated O
, O
he O
shaded O
his O
face O
with O
his O
hand O
for O
an O
instant O
before O
speaking O
. O
" O
I O
have O
been O
calling O
on O
Mr. O
Bridgenorth S-PERSON
this O
morning O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
at O
last O

" O
as O
I O
expected O
, O
he O
can O
give O
me O
but O
little O
satisfaction O
on O
some O
points O
respecting O
the O
occurrence O
on O
the B-DATE
18th I-DATE
of I-DATE
last I-DATE
month E-DATE
which O
I O
desire O
to O
have O
cleared O
up O
. O
Perhaps O
you O
two S-CARDINAL
can O
tell O
me O
what O
I O
want O
to O
know O
. O
As O
intimate O
friends O
of O
Barton's S-PERSON
you O
probably O
know O
, O
or O
can O
conjecture O
a O
good O
deal O

Have O
no O
scruple O
as O
to O
speaking O
the O
truth O

What O
you O
say O
in O
this O

shall O
never O
be O
named O
again O
by O
me O

Besides O
, O
you O
are O
aware O

the O
law O
allows O
no O

tried O
twice O

the O
same O
offence O

" O
He O
stopped O
for O
a B-TIME
minute E-TIME
, O
for O
the O
mere O
act O
of O
speaking O

fatiguing O
to O
him O

the O
excitement O
of O
the B-DATE

I O

mine O

long O

a O
fancy O
for O
shooting O
at O
the O
gallery O

they O
used O
always O
to O
take O
this O

brag O
that O

it O
was O
old O

was O
sure O

" O
Jem S-PERSON

with O
self O

upbraiding O
pain O
how O
Mr. O

winced O
at O

Jem S-PERSON
went O
on O
speaking O

" O
One S-CARDINAL

it O
was O
on O
St. B-LOC

I O
met O
John S-PERSON
just O
coming O
out O
of O
our O
house O
, O
as O
I O
were O
going O
to O
my O
dinner O
. O
Mother O
was O
out O
, O
and O
he'd O
found O
no O
one O
in O
. O
He O
said O
he'd O
come O
to O
borrow O
the O
old O
gun O
, O
and O
that O
he'd O
have O
made O
bold O
, O

taken O
it O
, O

it O
was O
not O
to O
be O
seen O

Mother O
was O
afraid O
of O
it O
, O
so O
after O
father's O
death O
( O
for O
while O
he O
were O
alive O
, O
she O
seemed O
to O
think O
he O
could O
manage O
it O
) O
I O
had O
carried O
it O
to O
my O
own O
room O

I O
went O
up O
and O
fetched O
it O
for O
John S-PERSON
, O
who O
stood O
outside O
the O
door O
all O
the O
time O

" O
" O
What O
did O
he O
say O
he O
wanted O
it O
for O
? O
" O
asked O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
, O
hastily O
. O
" O
I O
don't O
think O
he O
spoke O
when O
I O
gave O
it O
him O
. O
At O
first S-ORDINAL
he O
muttered O
something O
about O
the O
shooting O
- O
gallery O
, O
and O
I O
never O
doubted O
but O
that O
it O
were O
for O
practice O
there O

I O
knew O
he O
had O
done O
years S-DATE

" O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
had O
strung O
up O
his O
frame O
to O
an O
attitude O
of O
upright O
attention O
while O
Jem S-PERSON
was O
speaking O

now O
the O
tension O
relaxed O
, O
and O
he O
sank O
back O
in O
his O
chair O
, O
weak O
and O
powerless O
. O
He O
rose O
up O
again O
, O
however O
, O
as O
Jem S-PERSON
went O
on O
, O
anxious O
to O
give O
every O
particular O
which O
could O
satisfy O
the O
bereaved O
father O

" O
I O
never O
knew O

I O

up O

implicating O

old O
friend O

the O
father O

So O
I O
refused O

tell O
Mr. O

aught O
about O
it O

would O
not O

you O

" O
Jem's S-PERSON
face O
became O
very O
red O
at O
the O
allusion O
he O
made O
to O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
but O
his O
honest O
, O
fearless O
eyes O
had O
met O
Mr. O
Carson's S-PERSON
penetrating O
gaze O
unflinchingly O
, O
and O
had O
carried O
conviction O
of O
his O
innocence O
and O
truthfulness O
. O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
felt O
certain O
that O
he O
had O
heard O
all O
that O
Jem S-PERSON
could O
tell O

Accordingly O
he O
turned O
to O
Job B-PERSON
Legh E-PERSON

by O
his O
confession O

must O
have O
been O
absent O

the O
time O

there O
comes O
a O
time O
in O

when O
they O
are O
lifted O
out O
of O

It O
took O
time O
before O
the O
stern O
nature O
of O
Mr. O
Carson S-PERSON
was O
compelled O
to O
the O
recognition O
of O
this O
secret O
of O
comfort O

that O

sternness O
prevented O

to O
his O
dying O
day O
Mr. O

considered O
hard O

superficially O

But O
those O
who O
were O
admitted O
into O
his O
confidence O
were O
aware O
, O
that O
the O
wish O
which O
lay O
nearest O
to O
his O
heart O
was O
that O
none O
might O
suffer O
from O
the O
cause O
from O
which O
he O
had O
suffered O

that O
a O
perfect O
understanding O

complete O
confidence O

love O
, O
might O
exist O
between O
masters O

men O

that O
the O
truth O
might O
be O
recognised O

the O

the O

by O
both O

This O
was O
the O
opposition O

expected O
from O
Mrs. O
Wilson S-PERSON

to O
whom O
the O

most O

feared O

evening O

through O
the O
night O

She O
blushed O
for O
shame O
at O
the O
remembrance O

folly O

hid O
her O
head O

made O
answer O

I'm O
almost O
loth O
to O
tell O
you O

" O
Ah O

I O
remember O

how O
did O
she O
know O

I O
was O
so O
put O
about O
that O
night O
I O
did O
not O

you O

" O
Mary S-PERSON
said O
all O
this O
in O
so O
open O
and O
innocent O
a O
manner O

that O
Jem S-PERSON
felt O
sure O
she O
knew O
not O
the O
truth O

Esther S-PERSON

he O
half O
hesitated O
to O
tell O
her O

length O
he O
replied O
, O
" O
Where O
did O
you O
see O
Esther S-PERSON

it O
out O

Oh O
! O
it O
was O
that O
horrible O
night O
which O
is O

dream O

she O
told O
him O
of O
Esther's S-PERSON
midnight O
visit O
, O
concluding O
with O
, O
" O
We O
must O
go O

see O
her O

What O
, O
Jem S-PERSON

alarmed O
by O
his O
hesitation O

no O

creatures O

walk O
the O
streets O

And O
he O
in O
his O
turn O
told O
of O
his O
encounter O
with O
Esther S-PERSON
, O
with O
so O
many O
details O
that O
Mary S-PERSON
was O
forced O
to O
be O
convinced O
, O

her O
heart O
rebelled O
against O
the O
belief O

up O

rose O

not O

that O

here O

let O
no O

alone O
in O
the O

she O
wanted O
a O

a O
queer O

that O

found O

had O
gone O
forth O

both O

saddened O
at O

sat O
silent O

some O
time O

After O

talked O
themselves O
back O

Mary S-PERSON
sat O
by O

his O
arm O
round O
her O

her O
head O
on O

thought O
over O

so O

she O
felt O

start O
, O

started O
too O
without O
knowing O
why O

she O
tried O
to O
see O
his O
countenance O

the O
shades O
of O
evening O

deepened O

on O
the O
outside O

gazing O
intently O

the O
dusky O
chamber O

While O
they O
watched O
, O
as O
if O
fascinated O
by O
the O
appearance O
, O
and O
unable O
to O
think O

a O

came O
over O
the O
bright O

down O

both O
at O

They O
carried O
her O
upstairs O

laid O
her O
on O
Mary's O
bed O
, O
not O
daring O

her O
, O
lest O

away O

it O
was O
all O

Towards O
midnight S-TIME

she O
opened O
wide O
her O

looked O
around O

knelt O
by O
the O

praying O
aloud O

fervently O
for O
her O
, O
but O
he O
stopped O
as O
he O
saw O
her O
roused O
look O

She O
sat O
up O
in O

" O
Has O
it O
been O
a O

" O
asked O
she O
wildly O
. O
Then O
with O
a O
habit O
, O
which O
came O
like O
instinct O
even O
in O
that O
awful O
dying O
hour O
, O
her O
hand O
sought O
for O
a O
locket O

hung O
concealed O
in O
her O
bosom O
, O
and O
, O
finding O
that O

knew O
all O
was O
true O

befallen O
her O
since O

an O

She O
fell O
back O

spoke O

never O
more O

She O
held O
the O
locket O

her O
child's O
hair O
still O
in O
her O

once O

cried O

sadly O
as O
long O

had O
any O
strength O

cry O

then O
she O
