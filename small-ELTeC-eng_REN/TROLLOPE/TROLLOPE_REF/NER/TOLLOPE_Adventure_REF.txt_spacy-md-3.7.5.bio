   | O
When O
the O
author O
of O
" O
Michael B-PERSON
Armstrong I-PERSON
" O
first B-ORDINAL
determined O
on O
attempting O
to O
draw O
the O
attention O
|
     | O
of O
her O
countrymen O
to O
the O
fearful O
evils O
inherent O
in O
the B-FAC
Factory I-FAC
System I-FAC
, O
as O
carried O
out O
in O
our O
|
     | O
manufacturing O
towns O
, O
she O
intended O
to O
divide O
her O
work O
into O
two B-CARDINAL
portions O
, O
which O
should O
present O
|
     | O
the O
same O
subject O
under O
two B-CARDINAL
different O
phases O
. O
It O
was O
her O
intention O
in O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
of O
these O
to O
drag O
|
     | O
into O
the B-DATE
light I-DATE
of I-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
and O
place O
before O
the O
eyes O
of O
Englishmen B-LANGUAGE
, O
the O
hideous O
mass O
of O
injustice O
|
     | O
and O
suffering O
to O
which O
thousands B-CARDINAL
of O
infant O
labourers O
are O
subjected O
, O
who O
toil O
in O
our O
monster O
|
     | O
spinning O
- O
mills O
. O
In O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
, O
she O
proposed O
that O
the O
hero O
of O
her O
tale O
, O
having O
lived O
through O
his O
|
     | O
toil O
- O
worn O
boyhood O
, O
should O
have O
been O
seen O
embarked O
in O
those O
perfectly O
constitutional O
struggles O
|
     | O
for O
the O
amelioration O
of O
the O
sufferings O
of O
his O
class O
, O
in O
which O
many O
of O
the O
more O
enlightened O
|
     | O
operatives O
have O
been O
for O
some B-DATE
years I-DATE
engaged O
. O

  | O
The O
first B-ORDINAL
division O
of O
the O
subject O
has O
been O
some O
time O
in O
the O
reader O
's O
hands O
. O
The O
true O
but O
most O
|
     | O
painful O
picture O
has O
been O
drawn O
faithfully O
and O
conscientiously O
. O
Of O
course O
voices O
have O
been O
|
     | O
raised O
to O
deny O
loudly O
the O
truth O
of O
all O
the O
author O
's O
statements O
, O
and O
to O
assert O
the O
whole O
to O
be O
a O
|
     | O
mere O
tissue O
of O
invention O
and O
falsehood O
. O
The O
same O
charges O
have O
been O
made O
against O
her O
upon O
|
     | O
another O
occasion O
, O
and O
she O
has O
lived O
to O
see O
the O
truth O
of O
her O
statements O
, O
so O
impugned O
, O
|
     | O
universally O
admitted O
. O
She O
awaits O
with O
perfect O
confidence O
the O
time O
when O
similar O
justice O
shall O
be O

     | O
rendered O

pages O

misguided O

a O
course O

must O
necessarily O

     | O
neutralize O

subversive O
of O
every O
species O

the O
author O
feels O
that O
it O

alike O

in O

of O

hold O
up O
as O

objects O
of O

it O
a O
laborious O
task O

is O
probably O
the O

richest O
in O

there O
was O
not O
any O
one O
who O
could O
vie O
in O

with O
him O

In O
a O
word O
, O
he O

     | O
shone O
amidst O
his O
rich O

like O
a O
golden O
sun O
, O
surrounded O
by O
silver O

But O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
was O
a O
superior O
man O
in O
all O
ways O
. O
He O
was O
six B-QUANTITY
feet I-QUANTITY
two I-QUANTITY
inches I-QUANTITY
in O
height O
, O
and O
|
     | O
stout O
in O
proportion O
, O
with O
hands O

feet O
that O
might O
have O
sufficed O
a O
giant O
. O
His O
intellectual O
|
     | O
gifts O
were O
also O
of O
no O
ordinary O
character O
. O
He O
liked O
well O
enough O
, O
perhaps O
, O
to O
stand O
pre O
- O
eminent O
|
     | O
in O
the O
commercial O
estimation O
of O
his O

  O
but O
so O
enlightened O
was O
his O
spirit O
, O
that O
he O
|
     | O
liked O
better O
still O
to O
shine O
before O

as O
a O
man O
of O

, O
a O

But O
beyond O
|
     | O
all O
else O
, O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
valued O
himself O
upon O
his O
reputation O
for O
the O
lighter O
graces O
of O
wit O
and O
|
     | O
gallantry O
: O
he O
sought O
to O
make O
himself O

mixture O

He O
was O
often O
heard O
to O
declare O

that O
he O
loved O
nothing O

as O

light O

world O
hand O

The O

every O

who O

     | O
listen O
  O
she O
despised O
such O
weakness O

her O

that O

Nevertheless O

with O

by O
indulging O
in O
some O
remarkable O

variations O
from O
its O
ordinary O

, O
nobody O

scarcely O
any O
body O

attempted O
to O
deny O
that O
she O
was O

     | O
on O
the O
whole O
a O
very O
charming O
woman O
. O
Such O
was O
the O
testimony O
of O
her O
general O
acquaintance O
  O
those O
|
     | O
who O
knew O
her O
better O
were O
aware O
that O
her O
moral O
qualities O
outshone O
, O
as O
they O
always O
ought O
to O
do O
, O
|
     | O
all O
her O
external O
graces O
. O
She O
was O
a O
faithful O
and O
exceedingly O
fond O
wife O
, O
and O
doted O
upon O
all O
her O

     | O
children O
  O
no O
woman O
could O
more O
heartily O
detest O
every O
species O
of O
light O
flirting O
airs O
in O
females O
, O
|
     | O
and O
, O
being O
deeply O
sensible O
of O
the O
dangerous O
attractions O
of O
youth O
and O
beauty O
in O
her O
own O
sex O
, O
she O
|
     | O
studiously O
avoided O
bringing O
those O
of O
her O

might O

thereby O
from O
coming O
in O

     | O
with O
any O
thing O
of O
the O
kind O
  O
so O
that O
the O
female O
portion O
of O
her O
establishment O
consisted O
of O
the O

     | O
ugliest O

neat O

carefully O
dressed O
middle O

The O
knight O

his O
excellent O

blessed O
with O
a O
very O
numerous O
progeny O

certainly O
not O

     | O
less B-CARDINAL

eighteen I-CARDINAL

twenty I-CARDINAL
  O
but O
, O
as O
they O
were O
rarely O
all O
at O
home O
together O
, O
it O
was O
at O
no O
time O

     | O
easy O
to O
count O
them O
. O
| 
  | O
Augustus B-PERSON
, O
the O
eldest O
of O
the O
family O
, O
was O
a O
prodigiously O
fine O
young O
man O
, O
just O
returned O
from O
|
     | O
college O
. O
He O
had O
not O
indeed O
thought O
it O
necessary O
to O
take O
a O
degree O
, O
nor O
did O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
or O
her O
|
     | O
ladyship O
particularly O
wish O
it O
  O
both O
of O
them O
being O
of O
opinion O
that O
little O
distinction O
could O
be O
|
     | O
gained O
by O
the O
assumption O
of O
a O
title O
which O
was O
never O
used O
in O
society O
, O
and O
to O
which O
he O
conceived O
|
     | O
every O
Englishman O
to O
be O
eligible O
who O
could O
just O
read O
and O
write O
a O
little O
. O
But O
as O
, O
on O
all O
points O
|
     | O
that O
concerned O
the O
interest O
of O
his O
eldest O
son O
, O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
was O
too O
deeply O
interested O
to O
run O
any O
|
     | O
risk O
of O
blundering O
: O
he O
did O
not O
give O
his O
consent O
for O
the O
return O
of O
Augustus B-PERSON
, O
without O
his O
having O
|
     | O
gone O
through O
this O
idle O
academic O
ceremony O
, O
till O
he O
had O
paid O
a O
visit O
to O
the O
rector O
of O
his O
parish O
, O
|
     | O
to O
elicit O
from O
him O
some O
information O
on O
the O
subject O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
May O
I O
ask O
, O
sir O
, O
" O
said O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
abruptly O
, O
" O
what O
degree O
you O
took O

the O
university O

, O
though O
a O
good O
man O
, O
and O
an O
excellent O
clergyman O
to O
boot O
, O
he O
had O
a O
|
     | O
strong O
taste O
for O
humour O
, O
and O
had O
already O
discovered O
that O
his O
neighbour O
at O
the O
great O
house O
was O
|
     | O
rich O
in O
more O
ways O
than O
one O
. O
It O
was O
, O
therefore O
, O
with O
the O
utmost O
civility O
that O
he O
answered O
, O
" O
My O

     | O
degree O

does O
it O

you O
any O

you O

" O
I O

Sir O

the O

" O
I O
thank O
you O

for O
your O
sincerity O

" O
rejoined O
the O
knight O

" O
It O
was O
important O
that O

Mr. O

" O

Hetherington B-ORG

replied O
the O
clergyman O
. O

  | O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
returned O
from O
this O
visit O
very O
well O
pleased O
with O
the O
new O

Mr. O

immediately O
comforted O

prepare O

, O
within O
ten B-DATE

it O

     | O
the O

Altogether O
, O
it O
was O

the O
finest O
family O
ever O

It O
happened O
upon O
a O
broiling O
day O
about O
the B-DATE

, O
during O
one B-CARDINAL

fashionables O

at O
dinner O

It O
may O
have O
been O
remarked O
by O
those O

study O
such O
subjects O

that O
there O
is O
a O
difference O

between O
a O
dinner O

party O
given O
at O
such O
a O
grand O
mansion O
as O
that O
of O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling I-PERSON
, O
and O
one O
at O
|
     | O
a O
dwelling O
of O
perhaps O
not O
a O
quarter O
the O

where O
the O

order O

aristocracy O

a O

a O
shorter O
purse O

At O
both O
, O
probably O
, O
the O
banquet O
will O

     | O
be O
a O
costly O
one O

yet O
the O
one B-CARDINAL

come O
off O

a O
manner O

unlike O

     | O
possible O
to O
the O
other O
. O
There O
is O
something O
in O
the O
usual O
way O
of O
wearing O
stiff O
new O
- O
made O
grandeur O
, O

     | O
not O
far O
unlike O
that O
of O

clothes O

Neither O
the O
one O
nor O
the O
other O
sit O

     | O
easily O

  | O
At O
this O
splendid O
dinner O
at O
Dowling B-FAC
Lodge I-FAC

the O
company O

a O
selection O

on O
the O
most O
legitimate O
principles O

exclusiveness O
  O
no O

     | O
invited O
who O
did O
not O
drive O
four B-CARDINAL
horses O
at O
the O
races O

To O
this O
there O
were O
indeed O
two B-CARDINAL
exceptions O

     | O
The O
first B-ORDINAL
was O
the O
Right O
Honourable O
Lady O
Clarissa B-PERSON

but O
this O
distinguished O
lady O

though O

     | O
she O
drove O
only B-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
pony O
instead O
of O
four B-CARDINAL
horses O
, O
was O
considered O
by O
all O
the O
country O
round O
as O
the O
|
     | O
one B-CARDINAL
thing O
needful O
to O
render O
a O
party O
completely O
elegant O
. O
She O
was O
, O
indeed O
, O
neither O
young O
, O

     | O
handsome O

nor O
rich O
, O
but O
she O
was O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa I-PERSON
, O
and O
this O
was O
enough O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
other O
exception O
was O
to O
be O
found O
in O
the O
rotund O
person O
of O
Dr. O
Crockley B-PERSON
, O
who O
having O
formerly O

     | O
been O
a O

made O
a O
little O
fortune O

taken O
out O
a O
diploma O
, O
had O
lately O
married O
a O

     | O
beauty O

and O
settled O
in O
the O
town O
of O
Ashleigh B-PERSON
, O
where O
he O
was O
well O
pleased O
to O
pick O
up O
a O
few O
guinea O
|
     | O
fees O
, O
both O
as O
a O
public O
evidence O
of O
his O
being O
a O
real O
M.D. O
, O
and O
as O
a O
private O
fund O
wherewith O
to O

     | O
indulge O
his O
still O
very O
tender O
passion O

buying O

fat O
little O
gentleman O
was O
an O
especial O
favourite O
with O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
, O
chiefly O
on O
account O
of O
|
     | O
his O
jocund O
humour O
and O
ready O
laugh O
  O
and O
also O
, O
perhaps O
, O
because O
he O
had O
a O
pleasant O
way O
, O
peculiar O
|
     | O
to O
himself O
, O
of O
paying O
compliments O
in O
the O
bluntest O
and O
most O
unstudied O
manner O
possible O
. O
| 
   | O
sputtering O
a O
little O
, O
but O
going O
out O
before O
it O
is O
able O
to O
communicate O
its O
light O
. O
|  
  | O
The O
very O
sight O
of O
the O
servants O
as O
they O
panted O
round O
the O
table O
, O
was O
quite O
enough O
to O
smother O
|
     | O
and O
stifle O
all O
inclination O
for O
enjoyment O
— O
their O
shoes O
creaked O
— O
their O
faces O
shone O
— O
ice O
became O
|
     | O
water O
— O
the O
salad O
looked O
as O
if O
it O
were O
stewed O
— O
the O
cucumbers O
seemed O
to O
have O
fainted O
away O
— O
the O
|
     | O
prodigious O
turbot O
smelt O
fishy O
, O
and O
its O
attendant O
lobster O
- O
sauce O
glowed O
not O
with O
a O
deeper O
tint O
, O
|
     | O
than O
did O
my O
Lady O
Dowling B-PERSON
's O
cheeks O
as O
her O
nose O
caught O
the O
unfragrant O
gale O
. O
In O
short O
, O
it O
was O
a O
|
     | O
great O
dinner O
in O
the O
dog O
- O
days O
, O
and O
no O
more O
need O
be O
said O
of O
it O
. O
| 
  | O
Great O
was O
the O
inward O
satisfaction O
of O
every O
guest O
, O
when O
at O
last O
Lady B-PERSON
Dowling I-PERSON
rose O
, O
and O
gave O
|
     | O
signal O
that O
the O
party O
was O
to O
be O
divided O
in O
half B-CARDINAL
. O
The O
languid O
ladies O
welcomed O
the O
coolness O
of O
|
     | O
the O
marble O
hall O
as O
they O
passed O
through O
it O
, O
and O
the O
gentlemen O
gazed O
eagerly O
at O
the O
butler O
as O
he O
|
     | O
brought O
forward O
a O
fresh O
supply O
of O
claret O
, O
and O
a O
reinforcement O
of O
ice O
. O
But O
the O
enjoyment O
of O
|
     | O
neither O
party O
lasted O
long O
  O
for O
Lady B-PERSON
Dowling I-PERSON
was O
too O
grand O
and O
too O
solemn O
not O
to O
marshal O
all O
her O
|
     | O
company O
into O
her O
fine O
drawing O
- O
room O
, O
where O
they O
were O
all O
ceremoniously O
deposited O
on O
satin B-PERSON
sofas O
, O
|
     | O
amidst O
swelling O
pillows O
that O
might O
have O
defied O
the B-DATE
frosts I-DATE
of I-DATE
January B-DATE
  O
while O
seven B-CARDINAL
or O
eight B-CARDINAL
|
     | O
hot O
- O
looking O
children O
were O
commanded O
to O
walk O
round O
the O
circle O
and O
kiss O
every O
body O
. O
| 
  | O
Nor O
did O
the O
gentlemen O
fare O
much O
better O
  O
for O
scarcely O
had O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
door O
closed O
after O
|
     | O
the O
ladies O
, O
before O
the O
shining O
baldhead O
of O
Dr. O
Crockley B-PERSON
stretched O
itself O
up O
nearly O
to O
a O
level O
|
     | O
with O
the O
long O
- O
backed O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
's O
breast O
- O
pin O
, O
whilst O
, O
with O
a O
very O
ominous O
sort O
of O
growl O
, O
|
     | O
making O
itself O
heard O
before O
his O
lips O
opened O
, O
he O
first B-ORDINAL
preluded O
, O
and O
then O
uttered O
the O
following O
|
     | O
speech O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
it O
, O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
. O
— O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
this O
business O
at O
the O
Weavers B-PERSON
' O
Arms O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
What O
business O
, O
Doctor O
? O
" O
replied O
his O
friend O
sharply O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Why O
this O
meeting O
, O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
. O
I O
ca O
n't O
get O
the O
notion O
of O
a O
strike O
out O
of O
my O
head O
. O
" O
Every O
|
     | O
chair O
was O
drawn O
towards O
the O
little O
doctor O
: O
nobody O
had O
heard O
a O
word O
of O
it O
. O
" O
Well O
, O
gentleman O
, O
|
     | O
perhaps O
I O
am O
mistaken O
— O
perhaps O
there O
has O
been O
no O
meeting O
, O
" O
resumed O
the O
friendly O
doctor O
. O
" O
God O
|
     | O
knows O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
wish O
to O
spoil O
the O
enjoyment O
of O
this O
delightful O
hour O
  O
but O
at O
any O
rate O
, O
my O
good O
|
     | O
friends O
, O
it O
is O
as O
well O
for O
you O
to O
be O
on O
the O
look O
- O
out O
. O
" O
Then O
lowering O
his O
voice O
, O
he O
muttered O
, O
as O
|
     | O
near O
to O
the O
ear O
of O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
as O
he O
could O
reach O
, O
" O
I O
know O
that O
your O
people O
are O
meeting O
, O
in O
|
     | O
doors O
and O
out O
of O
doors O
. O
But O
you O
are O
such O
a O
good O
, O
generous O
, O
kind O
- O
hearted O
creature O
, O
that O
I O
dare O
|
     | O
say O
we O
shall O
hear O
, O
before O
long O
, O
of O
your O
having O
done O
some O
d O
— O
d O
goodnatured O
thing O
or O
other O
, O
and O
|
     | O
that O
perhaps O
will O
set O
all O
right O
  O
who O
knows O
? O
" O
| 
   | O
believe O
, O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
, O
that O
my O
lady O
's O
coffee O
would O
do O
more O
to O
cool O
us O
than O
your O
|
     | O
wine O
. O
" O
The O
opinion O
was O
not O
opposed O
, O
and O
, O
much O
earlier O
than O
usual O
, O
the O
gentlemen O
rose O
, O
and O
|
     | O
followed O
the O
ladies O
. O
|  
  | O
But O
this O
movement O
did O
not O
appear O
greatly O
to O
increase O
the O
enjoyment O
of O
either O
party O
. O
It O
was O
|
     | O
near O
nine B-TIME
o'clock I-TIME
, O
but O
the O
heat O
continued O
to O
be O
most O
oppressive O
, O
and O
the O
company O
being O
for O
the O
|
     | O
most O
part O
massive O
in O
all O
ways O
, O
their O
union O
produced O
more O
additional O
caloric O
than O
gaiety O
. O
The O
|
     | O
whole O
process O
seemed O
to O
have O
the O
power O
of O
turning O
the B-TIME
hours I-TIME
into O
molten O
lead O
as O
they O
passed O
, O
a O
|
     | O
portion O
of O
which O
appeared O
to O
drop O
, O
and O
weigh O
heavily O
on O
each O
individual O
head O
. O
In O
vain O
Sir O
|
     | O
Matthew B-PERSON
made O
the O
circuit O
of O
the O
company O
, O
pausing O
in O
front O
either O
of O
the O
richest O
or O
handsomest O
|
     | O
ladies O
, O
as O
duty O
or O
inclination O
preponderated O
  O
in O
vain O
he O
uttered O
his O
newest O
puns O
and O
freshest O
|
     | O
bon O
- O
mots O
— O
not O
one O
of O
them O
had O
strength O
to O
laugh O
, O
beyond O
a O
little O
feeble O
" O
he O
, O
he O
! O
" O
and O
even O
|
     | O
that O
was O
evidently O
a O
painful O
effort O
. O
| 
  | O
Things O
were O
in O
this O
state O
, O
when O
Lady O
Clarissa B-PERSON
Shrimpton I-PERSON
suddenly O
rose O
from O
the O
silken O
couch O
|
     | O
amidst O
whose O
pillows O
she O
was O
imbedded O
, O
and O
, O
without O
explaining O
her O
intentions O
to O
my O
Lady O
|
     | O
Dowling B-PERSON
, O
or O
any O
one O
else O
, O
darted O
through O
the O
open O
French B-NORP
- O
window O
, O
and O
out O
upon O
the O
well O
- O
shaven O
|
     | O
lawn O
. O
| 
   | O
Had O
it O
been O
possible O
that O
any O
one O
in O
the O
room O
could O
have O
been O
ignorant O
of O
the O
rank O
of O
Lady B-ORG
|
     | I-ORG
Clarissa I-ORG
, O
he O
must O
from O
that O
moment O
have O
felt O
an O
innate O
conviction O
that O
she O
was O
somebody O
  O
for O
|
     | O
nobody O
that O
was O
not O
somebody O
could O
have O
ventured O
upon O
so O
daring O
an O
escapade O
from O
such O
a O
solemn O
|
     | O
presence O
- O
chamber O
. O
The O
effect O
it O
produced O
was O
electric O
. O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
darted O
across O
the O
room O
with O
|
     | O
the O
eagerness O
of O
a O
man O
of O
gallantry O
and O
gaiety O
. O
He O
piqued O
himself O
upon O
being O
, O
of O
all O
the O
great O
|
     | O
men O
in O
the O
neighbourhood O
, O
the O
one O
upon O
whom O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa I-PERSON
bestowed O
the O
most O
attention O
. O
His O
|
     | O
estimate O
of O
the O
outward O
advantages O
of O
his O
extensive O
person O
was O
indeed O
not O
a O
low O
one O
  O
and O
, O
|
     | O
despite O
all O
his O
lady O
could O
do O
to O
crush O
such O
an O
odious O
idea O
, O
he O
was O
conscious O
that O
he O
was O
|
     | O
devoted O
to O
the O
fair O
sex O
, O
and O
flattered O
himself O
that O
the O
fair O
sex O
was O
not O
ungrateful O
. O
In O
fact O
, O
|
     | O
his O
general O
manner O
to O
ladies O
had O
a O
good O
deal O
of O
what O
in O
female O
slang O
is O
called O
|
        | O
swaining O
|  | O
talent O
, O
pictorial O
talent O
, O
epigrammatic O
talent O
, O
every O
kind O
of O
talent O
, O
and O
it O
was O
|
     | O
certainly O
very O
delightful O
to O
be O
appreciated O
by O
such O
a O
superior O
creature O
as O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa I-PERSON
. O
So O
|
     | O
strongly O
indeed O
did O
this O
intellectual O
sympathy O
between O
them O
occasionally O
manifest O
itself O
, O
that O
|
     | O
not O
even O
the O
sharp O
elbows O
and O
red O
- O
tipped O
nose O
of O
the O
noble O
lady O
, O
who O
, O
to O
borrow O
the O
phrase O
of O
|
     | O
an O
inimitable O
describer O
, O
was O
in O
every O
sense O
" O
|  | O
preter O
- O
blue O
perfect O
|  | O
, O
" O
could O
render O
Lady O
|
     | O
Dowling B-PERSON
quite O
easy O
respecting O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
friendship O
. O
Nor O
was O
it O
without O
something O
like O
a O
|
     | O
pang O
that O
she O
marked O
the O
sudden O
alacrity O
of O
movement O
with O
which O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
now O
strode O
across O
|
     | O
the O
floor O
to O
accompany O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa I-PERSON
in O
the O
extraordinary O
frolic O
which O
led O
her O
, O
in O
white O
satin O
|
     | O
shoes O
and O
a O
gauze O
dress O
, O
to O
exchange O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
for O
the O
garden O
, O
at O
nine B-TIME
o'clock I-TIME
in O
the O
|
     | O
evening O
. O
|  
  | O
But O
upon O
this O
occasion O
, O
as O
upon O
many O
others O
, O
Lady B-PERSON
Dowling I-PERSON
found O
consolation O
in O
the O
well O
- O
known O
|
     | O
fact O
, O
that O
Lady O
Clarissa B-PERSON
rarely O
moved O
a O
step O
without O
being O
obsequiously O
attended O
by O
her O
humble O
|
     | O
companion O
, O
Miss O
Mogg B-PERSON
. O
This O
young O
lady O
had O
been O
selected O
to O
fill O
her O
present O
enviable O
situation O
, O
|
     | O
principally O
from O
her O
appearance O
, O
though O
she O
was O
indeed O
by O
no O
means O
void O
of O
many O
other O
|
     | O
qualifications O
admirably O
suited O
to O
it O
. O
But O
in O
appearance O
she O
was O
a O
striking O
contrast O
to O
her O
|
     | O
tall O
and O
slender O
patroness O
  O
and O
, O
notwithstanding O
Lady O
Clarissa B-PERSON
's O
mental O
superiority O
, O
she O
was O
|
     | O
not O
insensible O
to O
the O
advantage O
of O
having O
a O
foil O
that O
should O
set O
off O
the O
charms O
upon O
which O
she O
|
     | O
particularly O
prided O
herself O
. O
Lady O
Clarissa B-PERSON
had O
a O
thin O
, O
narrow O
foot O
, O
and O
an O
ancle B-ORG
that O
resembled O
|
     | O
nothing O
so O
much O
as O
the O
leg O
of O
a O
Robin B-PERSON
red O
- O
breast O
  O
the O
person O
of O
Miss O
Mogg B-PERSON
was O
supported O
on O
|
     | O
shafts O
that O
told O
her O
Saxon O
origin O
, O
and O
feet O
that O
need O
not O
have O
shrunk O
from O
sustaining O
an O
ox O
. O
|
     | O
Lady O
Clarissa B-PERSON
's O
slender O
waist O
might O
have O
been O
encircled O
by O

was O
as O

its O
straight O

nature O
enabled O
her O

it O

a O
bushy O

to O

" O
Only O

" O
Oh O

such O
an O

being O
the O
richest O
young O
lady O
in O

very O

     | O
properly O

Three B-CARDINAL

started O
up O

strange O

Lady B-PERSON

Dowling I-PERSON

did O
not O

greatly O

that O
the B-ORG

be O
enlarged O
. O
But O
, O

     | O
though O
not O
by O
her O

the O
adventurous O
fair O
ones O
were O
stopped O
before O

accomplished O
their O

     | O
design O
, O
by O
a O
chorus O
of O
remonstrances O
from O
all O

" O

your O

with O
a O
vast O

that O
before O

stood O
firm O

all O
his O
elegant O

, O
perfectly O
well O

     | O
remembered O
that O
she O

two B-QUANTITY

so O
, O
before O

foot O
twice O

in O
her O
impatience O

seemed O

a O
short O
ramble O

asked O

almost O
came O

" O
You O

dear O

considerable O

again O

hanging O
on O
his O
arm O
with O
such O
an O

     | O
evident O
degree O
of O
weakness O
, O
as O
showed O
the O
slender O

Sir O

" O

ejaculated O
Lady O

" O
you O

no O

moment O

the O
curious O
stare O

idle O
eyes O

dear O
Sir O

she O
gently O

pulled O
him O
forward O

spoke O

to O
the O
gentle O
violence O

carried O
him O
forward O

, O
in O
what O
Lady O

     | O
Clarissa B-PERSON
felt O
to O
be O
very O
eloquent O
silence O
, O
he O
proceeded O
for O
a O
few O
steps O
farther O
. O
Considerably O
, O

     | O
however O
, O
before O
they O
had O
reached O
the O
dreaded O
turning O
, O
his O
good O
star O
shot O
a O
ray O
upon O
him O
in O
the O

     | O
shape O
of O
a O
very O
large O
cow O
, O
with O
a O
pair O
of O
enormous O
horns O
, O
that O
slowly O
turned O
the O
corner O

     | O
fronted O
them O
. O

  | O
" O
Good O
heaven O
! O
" O
he O
exclaimed O
in O
an O
accent O
of O
great O
alarm O
. O
— O
" O
There O
is O
that O
horrid O
spotted O
cow O

the O
worst O
beast O

back O

dearest O
Lady O

turn O
back O

instantly O

  | O
" O
How O
kindly O
considerate O
! O

returned O
Lady O
Clarissa B-PERSON

" O
But O
you O

mind O

Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON

Were O
I O
alone O

indeed O
, O
I O
might O
tremble O

turn O
as O
pale O
as O
the O

     | O
veriest O
child O

ever O
hid O
its O
face O

a O
nurse O

with O
you O

" O
— O
and O
here O
the O
lady O

     | O
turned O
a O
very O
flattering O
glance O
on O
the O
athletic O
form O
of O
her O
protector O
— O

  | O
" O
Heaven O
knows O

replied O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
, O
once O
more O
pressing O
her O
lean O
arm O
, O
" O
Heaven O
knows O
that O
all O

     | O
which O
the O
strength O
of O

could O
do O
to O
protect O

would O
not O

left O
undone O
by O
me O
— O
but O

     | O
consider O
the O
dog O
! O
" O
he O
added O
, O
pointing O
to O
a O
little O
cur O
that O
always O
followed O
him O

" O
its O
power O
of O

     | O
irritating O
an O
animal O
of O
this O
kind O
is O
quite O
extraordinary O
. O
" O
And O
as O
he O
spoke O
, O
he O
whistled O
in O
a O
|
     | O
note O
which O
meant O
, O
as O
his O
dog O
Spite O
knew O
as O
well O
as O
he O
did O
, O
neither O
more O

" O
At O

     | O
her O

Spite O

" O

  | O
" O
If O
any O
thing O
can O
keep O

resumed O
the O
knight O
, O
" O
it O
is O
whistling O
to O
him O

" O

  | O
Obedient O
to O
the O
true O
meaning O
of O
the O
signal O
, O
however O
, O
the O
dog O
sprang O
forward O
, O
and O
of O
course O
|
     | O
there O
ensued O
the O
scene O
which O
always O
follows O
on O
such O
occasions O
. O
The O
dog O
yelped O
, O
and O
affected O
to O
|
     | O
spring O
at O
the O
nose O
of O
the O
cow O
, O
while O
she O
, O
somewhat O
accelerating O
her O
stately O
pace O
, O
threw O
up O
her O

     | O
tail O
, O
and O
bent O
down O
her O
head O
till O
her O
horns O
nearly O
touched O
the O
ground O
, O
offering O
so O
exact O
an O

     | O
image O
of O
" O
the O
cow O
with O
the O
crumpled O
horn O
, O
" O
with O
whose O
portrait O
her O
ladyship O
's O
early O
studies O
had O
|
     | O
made O
her O
familiar O
, O
that O
her O
confidence O
in O
the O
prowess O
of O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
could O
sustain O
her O
no O
|
     | O
longer O
, O
and O
she O
rapidly O
uttered O
a O
succession O
of O
tremendous O
screams O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
purpose O
of O
the O
knight O
was O
accomplished O
, O
and O
he O
therefore O
indulged O
the O
fair O
lady O
by O
|
     | O
letting O
her O
scream O
on O
for O
at B-TIME
least I-TIME
a I-TIME
minute I-TIME
and O
a O
half O
, O
while O
he O
supported O
her O
with O
every O

     | O
appearance O
of O
the O
most O
pitying O
tenderness O
. O
Meanwhile O
, O
two B-CARDINAL
little O
boys O
, O
who O
were O
making O
their O

     | O
way O
from O
the O
factory O
homewards O
, O
across O
a O
field O
by O
the O
side O
of O
the O
lane O
, O
ran O
with O
terrified O

     | O
curiosity O
, O
and O
all O
the O
strength O
they O
had O
, O
to O
a O
gate O
, O
through O
which O
they O
could O
see O
the O

     | O
interesting O
spectacle O
of O
a O
fine O
full O
- O
dressed O
lady O
, O
screaming O
with O
all O
her O
might O
from O
between O

the O
sheltering O
arms O
of O

" O
Come O
here O
, O
you O
young O
scamps O

cried O
the O
knight O
, O
on O
perceiving O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
little O
heads O
peeping O

     | O
over O
the O
gate O
: O
" O

The O
youngest O

by O
far O
the O
stoutest O
and O
tallest O
of O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
boys O
, O
instantly O
obeyed O
this O

command O
, O
and O
placing O
himself O
midway O
between O
the O
tormented O
cow O

the O
fair O
creature O
, O
whose O
|
     | O
nerves O
her O
menacing O
attitude O
had O
so O
cruelly O
shaken O
, O
he O
stood O
manfully O
astride O
in O
the O
middle O
of O

     | O
the O
lane O
, O
flourished O
his O
ragged O
hat O
on O
high O
, O
and O
with O
a O
few O
lusty O
" O
wough O
! O
woughs B-ORG
! O
" O
repeated O
at O
|
     | O
the O
top O
of O
his O
young O
voice O
, O
succeeded O
in O
turning O
the O
front O
of O
the O
enemy O
, O
which O
was O
presently O

     | O
seen O

by O
a O
sort O

feeble O

ambling O
little O

speedily O

out O

with O
very O
sentimental O

     | O
fervour O

clear O
that O

as O
it O

most O
heartily O

     | O
inwardly O
cursing O
the O
audacious O
exaction O
of O
his O
fair O

in O
attempting O
to O
make O
him O
pay O
the O

her O

The O
idea O
of O
being O
thus O
entrapped O
, O

forced O
to O
adopt O
" O

a O
bag O

rags O
out O
of O

( O
for O

galled O
him O
for O
a O

     | O
moment O
so O
severely O

that O

an O

no O

happily O

had O
received O
from O

instantly O
decided O

that O

his O
resolution O

Lady O

drew O
from O

a O

something O

elaborately O

with O

she O
was O
in O
the O

that O
their O

, O
after O

the O
unfortunate O

     | O
thenceforward O

out O

I O
should O

" O
Well O

just O
step O
back O

Michael B-PERSON
now O
, O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL

ventured O

up O
into O
the O
face O

the O
majestic O

     | O
Sir O

his O
little O
heart O
sank O
within O
him O

It O
was O
quite O
evident O
from O
the O

speaking O

no O

his O

he O
patted O
his O

something O

down O

as O
far O
as O
the O

give O
the O
message O
ourselves O
to O
that O
lazy O

     | O
fellow O
that O
he O
says O
is O
asleep O
under O
the O
hedge O
— O

two B-DATE
years I-DATE
older O
than O
this O
one O

— O
Only O

     | O
conceive O
! O
— O
I O
am O
delighted O
that O

he O

is O
not O
to O
be O
the O
object O
of O
your O
bounty O
, O
for O
there O
|
     | O
is O
nothing O
so O
detestable O
as O
idleness O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
had O
turned O
in O
compliance O
with O
the O
word O
and O
action O
, O
which O
expressed O
her O
ladyship O
's O
|
     | O
desire O
that O
he O
should O
do O
so O
, O
and O
in O
another B-TIME
minute I-TIME
they O
reached O
the O
gate O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Where O
is O
this O
brother O
of O
yours O
? O
— O
I O
do O
n't O
see O
him O
, O
" O
said O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa I-PERSON
, O
looking O
about O
. O

  | O
" O
There O
he O
is O
, O
ma'am O
, O
if O
you O
please O
, O
" O
replied O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
once O
more O
climbing O
over O
the O
gate O
  O
and O
|
     | O
presently O
he O
was O
close O
under O
the O
flowery O
hedge O
, O
extending O
his O
two B-CARDINAL
hands O
to O
raise O
a O
miserably O
|
     | O
sicklooking O
child O
, O
who O
was O
, O
in O
truth O
, O
soundly O
sleeping O
there O
. O
In O
consequence O
of O
a O
few O
words O
|
     | O
whispered O
to O
him O
by O
little O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
the O
boy O
came O
forward O
with O
a O
shuffling O
gait O
, O
his O
knees O
|
     | O
sloping O
inwards O
, O
and O
his O
legs O
frightfully O
emaciated O
: O
but O
the O
moment O
he O
reached O
the O
gate O
, O
Lady O
|
     | O
Clarissa B-PERSON
exclaimed O
, O
" O
Good O
gracious O
! O
how O
beautiful O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
It O
was O
indeed O
a O
lovely O
face O
that O
was O
then O
turned O
up O
to O
meet O
her O
eye O
  O
and O
when O
, O
as O
if O
somewhat O
|
     | O
daunted O
by O
her O
earnest O
gaze O
, O
he O
removed O
his O
own O
from O
her O
countenance O
to O
that O
of O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
, O
|
     | O
the O
bright O
flash O
that O
lighted O
it O
up O
for O
a O
moment O
made O
it O
appear O
more O
beautiful O
still O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
And O
what O
is O
your O
name O
, O
my O
pretty O
boy O
? O
" O
said O
the O
lady O
. O

  | O
" O
Edward B-PERSON
Armstrong I-PERSON
, O
" O
was O
the O
reply O
. O

  | O
" O
But O
, O
my O
dear O
child O
, O
you O
do O
n't O
look O
well O
, O
and O
you O
ought O
not O
to O
go O
to O
sleep O
so O
, O
quite O
late O
in O

     | O
the O
evening O
, O
upon O
the O
grass O

What O
makes O
you O
so O
very O
sleepy O

my O

you O

" O

  | O
" O
No O

replied O
the O
boy O
, O
furtively O
glancing O
at O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
, O
" O
I O
have O

   | O
off O

I O
am O
sure O
you O
will O
be O
quite O
chilled O
if O
you O
remain O
any O
longer O
out O

" O

" O
I O
believe O
you O
are O
right O

my O
dear O
friend O

said O
Lady B-PERSON

, O
with O
a O
glance O
of O
affectionate O

     | O
gratitude O
for O
this O
earnest O
zeal O

" O
Let O
us O
go O

I O
forget O
the O
kindness O

have O
shown O
me O

     | O
during O
this O
eventful O
walk O

heartless O

" O

  | O
For O
a O
moment O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa I-PERSON
held O
her O
coroneted O
handkerchief O
to O
her O
eyes O
, O
and O
then O
resumed O
. O
" O

     | O
home O

tell O
your O

by O
the O
by O

I O
trust O

not O

to O
you O
, O
that O
your O

     | O
brother O
Michael B-PERSON
is O
rewarded O
for O
an O
act O
of O
bravery O
that O
probably O
saved O
the O
life O
of O
an O
earl O

     | O
daughter O
— O
has O
been O
most O
generously O

nobly O
adopted O
by O
her O
friend O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling I-PERSON
, O
and O

     | O
that O
henceforward O
she O
need O
have O
no O
anxiety O
whatever O
on O
his O
account O
. O
Now O
, O
then O
, O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
, O
I O

     | O
am O
ready O

" O
| 
  | O
" O
Are O
we O
never O
to O
see O
Michael B-PERSON
again O
? O
" O
said O
the O
lame O
boy O
, O
while O
a O
sudden O
expression O
of O
anguish O

     | O
passed O
across O
his O
beautiful O
features O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Why O
not O
, O
child O
? O
" O
replied O
her O
ladyship O
rather O
sharply O
. O
" O
Do O
you O
suppose O
that O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON

I O

     | O
are O
going O
to O
hide O
him O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
It O
is O
all O
very O
well O
then O
, O
" O
returned O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
limping O
away O
. O
" O
But O
be O
sure O
to O
go O
and O
tell O
mother O

     | O
all O
about O
it O
yourself O

Mike B-PERSON
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Come O
along O
, O
little O
one O
! O
" O
said O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa I-PERSON
, O
moving O
off O
. O
" O
Follow O
behind O
this O
generous O

     | O
gentleman O

see O
the O
palace O
of O
a O
home O
which O
your O
bravery O
has O
won O

" O
| 
  | O
So O
saying O
, O
she O
moved O
on O
  O
the O
obsequious O
knight O
at O
her O
side O
, O
and O
the O
wondering O
Michael B-PERSON

     | I-PERSON
Armstrong I-PERSON
after O
her O
. O
| 
  | O
On O
reaching O
the O
gate O
beside O
the O
gardener O
's O
house O
, O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
paused O
. O
He O
had O
been O
meditating O
, O
|
     | O
while O
seemingly O
listening O
in O
rapt O
attention O
to O
the O
lady O
's O
talk O
, O
on O
the O
effect O
which O
would O
be O
|
     | O
produced O
on O
the O
party O
they O
were O
about O
to O
rejoin O
, O
by O
the O
appearance O
of O
the O
ragged O
little O
|
     | O
companion O
they O
had O
brought O
back O
with O
them O
. O
| 
  | O
Had O
he O
been O
a O
ragged O
sailor O
- O
boy O
, O
or O
a O
ragged O
plough O
- O
boy O
, O
or O
even O
a O
ragged O
chimney O
- O
sweeper O
, O
|
     | O
there O
might O
by O
possibility O
have O
been O
excited O
some O
feeling O
of O
curiosity O
and O
interest O
  O
but O
a O
|
     | O
ragged O
factory O
- O
boy O
was O
of O
all O
created O
beings O
the O
one B-CARDINAL
least O
likely O
to O
give O
birth O
to O
such O
|
     | O
emotions O
, O
among O
his O
friends O
and O
neighbours O
, O
or O
indeed O
to O
any O
other O
emotion O
fit O
to O
be O
exhibited O
|
     | O
in O
good O
society O
. O
So O
, O
merely O
saying O
to O
his O
fair O
friend O
, O
" O
Excuse O
me O
, O
my O
lady O
, O
for O
one B-CARDINAL
moment O
, O
" O
he O
|
     | O
once O
more O
knocked O
at O
the O
cottage O
- O
window O
, O
and O
called O
aloud O
for O
" O
Macnab B-PERSON
! O
" O
| 
  | O
The O
obedient O
North B-NORP
Briton I-NORP
appeared O
immediately O
, O
and O
was O
about O
to O
forestal O
the O
inquiry O
he O
|
     | O
anticipated O
by O
assurances O
that O
her O
ladyship O
's O
pines O
, O
peaches O
, O
and O
grapes O
, O
had O
all O
been O
|
     | O
consigned O
to O
the O
care O
of O
her O
ladyship O
's O
own O
serving O
- O
man O
, O
when O
he O
was O
very O
literally O
struck O
dumb O
|
     | O
by O
his O
master O
saying O
— O
|  
   | O
Observe O
, O
Macnab B-ORG
, O
and O
take O
care O
, O
if O
you O
please O
, O
that O
all O
the O
servants O
about O
the O
|
     | O
place O
know O
it O
, O
that O
this O
boy O
is O
to O
be O
the O
object O
of O
the O
greatest O
benevolence O
. O
" O

  | O
" O
The O
greatest O
— O
what O
was O
you O
pleased O
to O
say O
, O
sir O
? O
" O
said O
the O
Scotch O
gardener O
, O
really O
and O
truly O

     | O
doubting O
his O
own O
ears O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Benevolence O
, O
sir O
! O
" O
shouted O
the O
knight O
vehemently O
  O
" O
and O
woe O
to O
any O
one O

my O
estate O

" O

  | O
" O
How O
inspiring O
is O
this O
angelic O
goodness O
, O
" O
exclaimed O
Lady O
Clarissa B-PERSON
affectionately O
. O
" O
Ah O
, O
Sir O

     | O
Matthew B-PERSON

how O

" O

along O

my O
man O

said O
the O
Scotchman B-PERSON
, O
leading O
away O
Michael B-PERSON
  O
and O
he O
said O
no O
more O
till O
he O
|
     | O
was O
quite O
sure O
that O
the O
knight O
and O
the O
lady O
had O
got O
far O
enough O
in O
their O
progress O
across O
the O

     | O
garden O
, O
to O
be O
out O
of O
hearing O

then O
he O
added O
: O

me O
in O
God B-PERSON

what O
all O
this O
means O
? O
Why O
, O
you O
look O
for O
all O
the O
world O
like O
one O
of O
the O
little O
raggamuffins O

out O
of O

" O

now O

you O
'll O
be O
made O

talk O

I O
should O
not O

been O
one B-CARDINAL

half I-CARDINAL

much O
surprised O

Michael B-PERSON
timidly O

with O
half B-CARDINAL
a O
smile O

you O

I O
fancy O
. O
" O
So O
saying O
, O
the O
gardener O
rose O
, O
and O
giving O
a O
|
     | O
sort O
of O
general O
nod O
to O
the O
company O
, O
left O
the O
kitchen O
. O
| 
  | O
Considering O
that O
there O
had O
been O
nothing O
very O
affectionate O
in O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
intercourse O
|
     | O
which O
had O
taken O
place O
between O
them O
, O
it O
was O
rather O
singular O
that O
the O
little O
Michael B-PERSON
should O
feel O
|
     | O
as O
sorry O
as O
he O
did O
at O
the O
departure O
of O
Mr. O
Macnab B-PERSON
. O
But O
he O
did O
feel O
sorry O
, O
and O
when O
the O
door O
|
     | O
shut O
after O
him O
, O
he O
turned O
away O
, O
and O
hid O
his O
face O
with O
his O
uplifted O
arm O
. O
| 
  | O
Pride O
of O
place O
, O
and O
elevation O
of O
character O
, O
having O
been O
in O
a O
considerable O
degree O
satisfied O
by O
|
     | O
Mrs. O
Thompson B-PERSON
's O
energetic O
expression O
of O
her O
feelings O
, O
something O
like O
curiosity O
awoke O
within O
her O
|
     | O
to O
learn O
what O
the O
circumstances O
had O
been O
which O
had O
induced O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling I-PERSON
to O
declare O
an O
|
     | O
intention O
of O
acting O
benevolently O
. O
For O
a O
moment O
she O
struggled O
against O
it O
, O
and O
again O
seemed O
about O
|
     | O
to O
leave O
the O
room O
  O
but O
as O
she O
turned O
her O
eyes O
upon O
the O
child O
, O
she O
seemed O
to O
feel O
that O
before O
|
     | O
one O
so O
very O
abject O
, O
no O
loss O
of O
importance O
could O
be O
feared O
, O
even O
if O
she O
did O
question O
him O
. O
So O
, O
|
     | O
with O
the O
air O
of O
a O
judge O
walking O
up O
to O
the O
bench O
, O
she O
stalked O
onwards O
to O
the O
seat O
Mr. O
Macnab B-PERSON
had O
|
     | O
left O
, O
and O
placing O
her O
austere O
person O
in O
it O
, O
made O
a O
signal O
with O
her O
hand O
, O
that O
the O
kitchen O
- O
maid O
|
     | O
who O
had O
ventured O
to O
approach O
the O
little O
boy O
should O
stand O
back O
, O
and O
leave O
her O
space O
to O
examine O
|
     | O
him O
. O
| 
   | O
of O
this O
extraordinary O
scene O
, O
might O
be O
punished O
with O
as O
little O
suffering O
as O
|
     | O
possible O
. O
Two B-CARDINAL
sprightly O
housemaids O
seemed O
to O
find O
something O
vastly O
amusing O
in O
the O
whole O
|
     | O
business O
, O
though O
their O
evident O
merriment O
was O
restrained O
by O
the O
solemnity O
of O
Mrs. O
Thompson B-PERSON
's O
|
     | O
manner O
. O
|  
  | O
" O
Look O
up O
in O
my O
face O
, O
little O
boy O
, O
" O
said O
the O
housekeeper O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
she O
had O
seated O
herself O
and O
|
     | O
saw O
that O
those O
around O
her O
stood O
still O
, O
as O
if O
they O
had O
taken O
their O
places O
, O
and O
were O
prepared O
to O
|
     | O
listen O
. O
| 
  | O
Michael B-PERSON
did O
not O
move O
  O
he O
was O
probably O
ashamed O
to O
show O
that O
he O
was O
weeping O
, O
before O
the O
face O
of O
|
     | O
a O
lady O
who O
spoke O
so O
very O
grandly O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
kitchen O
- O
maid O
gave O
him O
a O
nudge O
, O
but O
a O
gentle O
one O
, O
whispering O
at O
the O
same O
time O
— O
" O
Look O
up O
, O
|
     | O
my O
boy O
. O
What O
be O
you O
' O
feard O
of O
? O
There O
's O
nobody O
as O
wants O
to O
hurt O
you O
here O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Thus O
encouraged O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
let O
his O
arm O
drop O
by O
his O
side O
, O
and O
discovered O
a O
face O
that O
was O
indeed O
|
     | O
sallow O
, O
and O
by O
no O
means O
very O
plump O
, O
but O
with O
features O
and O
expression O
which O
, O
whatever O
Sir O
|
     | O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
men O
and O
maids O
might O
think O
of O
it O
, O
might O
have O
sufficed O
to O
make O
the O
fortune O
of O
|
     | O
an O
able O
painter O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Whose O
child O
are O
you O
? O
" O
demanded O
the O
housekeeper O
. O
" O
Mother O
's O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
boy O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
suspected O
as O
much O
, O
" O
rejoined O
the O
inquisitor O
, O
half B-CARDINAL
aside O
to O
Mr. O
Jennings B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
" O
And O
I O
beant O
no O
ways O
surprised O
to O
hear O
it O
, O
I O
promise O
you O
, O
" O
he O
replied O
. O
| 
  | O
Mrs. O
Thompson B-PERSON
sighed O
deeply O
. O
" O
It O
is O
dreadful O
! O
" O
said O
she O
. O
Then O
, O
after O
taking O
a O
moment O
to O
|
     | O
recover O
herself O
, O
she O
resumed O
, O
" O
And O
where O
does O
the O
unhappy O
person O
live O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Please O
, O
ma'am O
, O
who O
? O
" O
said O
the O
puzzled O
boy O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
The O
— O
your O
mother O
, O
child O
. O
— O
Shame O
upon O
you O
for O
forcing O
me O
to O
name O
her O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
Michael B-PERSON
gave O
a O
little O
shake O
of O
the O
head O
, O
which O
seemed O
to O
the O
merciful O
kitchen O
- O
maid O
to O
say O
, O
|
     | O
that O
he O
did O
not O
know O
what O
the O
great O
lady O
meant O
  O
but O
he O
presently O
replied O
, O
as O
if O
discreetly O
|
     | O
determined O
to O
mind O
only O
what O
he O
did O
understand O
, O
" O
Mother O
lives O
in O
Hoxley B-FAC
Lane I-FAC
, O
ma'am O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
The O
most O
deplorable O
situation O
in O
the O
whole O
parish O
! O
inhabited O
only O
by O
the O
|  | O
very O
| 
     | O
lowest O
! O
" O
observed O
the O
housekeeper O
, O
with O
another O
indignant O
sigh O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
So O
much O
the O
worse O
for O
she O
, O
" O
muttered O
the O
kitchen O
- O
maid O
  O
but O
not O
loud O
enough O
to O
be O
heard O
by O
|
     | O
her O
in O
whose O
hands O
rested O
the O
appointment O
of O
kitchen O
- O
maids O
as O
well O
as O
cooks O
. O

  | O
" O
And O
why O
does O
such O
as O
you O
come O
here O
? O
" O
resumed O
the O
housekeeper O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Because O
the O
squire O
ordered O
t'other O
man O
to O
bring O
me O
, O
" O
answered O
Michael B-PERSON
. O

   | O
shape O
, O
both O
mind O
and O
body O
. O
You O
may O
take O
my O
word O
for O
that O
, O
all O
of O
you O
, O
" O
she O
added O
, O

     | O
looking O
round O
her O
  O
" O
and O
you O
will O
do O
well O

  | O
" O
I O
'll O
be O
burnt O
if O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
very O
likely O
that O
it O
was O
his O

him O
here O
, O

chuckling O

" O

" O
returned O
Mrs. O
Thompson B-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
frown O
. O
" O
God O
in O
heaven O
only O
knows O
what O

     | O
may O
have O
been O

— O
Not O

what O
it O
does O
look O
strange O

there O

no O
denying O

" O
Do O
you O
know O
any O
thing O
about O
your O
father O
, O
child O

" O
said O
Mr. O
Simkins B-PERSON
in O
a O
magisterial O
tone O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Father O
's O
in O
heaven O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
child O

" O
Mercy O
on O
me O
! O
do O
you O
hear O
him O

like O
mocking O
the O
Lord O

prayer O

exclaimed O
the O

     | O
lady's O

maid O
. O

  | O
" O
No O
, O
it O
is O
not O
! O
" O
said O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
while O
a O
flash O
of O
youthful O
indignation O
rushed O
into O
his O
face O
. O
|
     | O
" O
My O
father O
is O
in O
heaven O
along O
with O
God O

" O
I O
dare O
say O
he O
means O
that O
his O
father O
is O
dead O
, O

observed O
the O
butler O
with O
an O
air O
of O
great O
|
     | O
sagacity O
  O
" O
and O
if O
what O
has O
been O
jealoused O
at O
is O
correct O
, O

he O
added O
, O
winking O
his O
eye O
at O
Mr. O
|
     | O
Jennings B-PERSON
, O
" O
it O
is O
very O
natural O
that O
he O
should O
have O
been O
told O
to O
say O
so O
. O
" O

  | O
" O
That O
's O
very O
true O

said O
the O
housekeeper O
, O
" O
and O
it O
may O
be O
, O
certainly O
, O
that O
the O
child O
knows O

nothing O
about O
it O
whatever O
, O
either O
one B-CARDINAL
way O

t'other O

indeed O
I O
think O
it O
's O
a O
good O
deal O
the O
most O

likely O
that O
he O
does O
not O
  O
— O
but O
, O
any O
how O
, O
it O
's O
a O
very O
shocking O
business O
, O
and O
, O
as O
far O
as O
I O
am O

     | O
concerned O

I O
'll O
neither O

the O
matter O

— O
Of O
course O
, O
the O
men O

servants O
may O
do O

     | O
just O
as O
they O
like O
about O
taking O
notice O
of O
him O

for O
here O
he O
is O
, O

here O
he O
will O
bide O
, O
I O
dare O

     | O
say O
  O
but O
I O
recommend O
the O
maids O
to O
follow O
my O
example O
, O
and O
not O
to O
injure O
their O
characters O
, O
nor O
to O

     | O
corrupt O
their O
morals O
by O
having O
any O
thing O
to O
do O
with O
the O
offspring O
of O

It O
is O
more O
decent O
not O
to O

     | O
finish O
what O
I O
was O
going O
to O

for O
your O
goods O

young O
women O

lucky O
it O
is O
that O
there O
is O
no O

Mrs. O

then O
rose O
from O

turning O
her O
eyes O

indeed O
her O
head O

aside O

to O

     | O
prevent O
herself O
from O
again O
seeing O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
she O
walked O
with O
a O
degree O
of O
stateliness O
and O
majesty O
|
     | O
that O
few O
housekeepers O
ever O
attained O
, O
through O

passage O

into O
the O
sacred O
shelter O

her O
own O
parlour O

where O
she O
gave O
way O
to O
emotions O

rendered O
a O
glass O

absolutely O
necessary O

Meanwhile O
Michael B-PERSON
remained O
in O
no O
very O
happy O
condition O
in O
the O
kitchen O

He O
was O
very O
tired O
, O
very O

     | O
sleepy O
, O
very O
thirsty O

very O
much O
longing O
to O
see O
his O
mother O

very O
greatly O
puzzled O

as O

himself O

though O
accounted O

he O

talking O

together O

that O
no O

the O

filled O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
chorus O
. O
Then O
followed O
some O
facetious O

     | O
observations O
from O
Mr. O
Jennings B-PERSON
concerning O
Mrs. O
Thompson B-PERSON
, O
and O
a O
few O
of O
her O
peculiarities O
  O
and O
it O

     | O
was O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
the O
giggling O
which O
these O
occasioned O
, O
that O
the O
kitchen O

to O

— O

" O
Well O

now O
, O
you O
are O
all O
so O
keen O
, O
and O
so O
clever O
about O
her O
, O
that O
I O
wonder O
it O
do O
n't O
come O
into O

     | O
your O
heads O
to O
find O
out O
that O
she O
spoke O
just O
like O
an O
old O
fool O
and O
no O
better O
, O
when O
she O
invented O

     | O
all O
that O
rigmarole O
about O
the O
boy O
. O
Master O
might O
be O
just O

ten B-CARDINAL

worser O
too O

for O
any O
thing O

about O
him O

the O
worser O
he O
is O

the O
father O

be O

I O
was O

     | O
such O
a O
mighty O
good O
gentlewoman O

she O
thinks O
herself O

from O
giving O
such O
a O
bad O
father O
out O
of O
my O

" O
I O

Molly B-PERSON

said O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O

— O
" O

" O

observed O
the O

gravely O

reason O

before O

that O

no O

     | O
dirty O
little O
boy O

for O
it O
certainly O
does O
appear O
plain O
enough O

that O
his O

very O
little O

the O

there O

prayers O

the O
great O
Sir O

not O

, O
on O

spent O
his O
last O

cursing O

fervour O

the O
folly O

hideous O

at O
any O

, O
when O
he O
awoke O
the B-TIME
next I-TIME
morning I-TIME
with O
his O
head O
quite O

these O

if O
you O
set O
your O
wits O
to O
work O

you O
ca O
n't O
tell O

That O

the O
question O

Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
, O
asking O
your O
pardon O
. O
There O
's O
no O
great O
difficulty O
in O
|
     | O
finding O
out O
whether O
they O
are O
in O
a O
real O
faint O
, O
or O
only O
making O
the O
most O
of O
being O
a O
little O
sickish O

     | O
from O
standing O
, O
and O
want O
of O
air O
. O
That O
's O
not O
the O
difficulty O
. O
The O
thing O
is O
to O
know O
, O
when O
they O
|
     | O
really O
take O
to O
the O
downright O
faintings O
, O
whether O
they O
are O
likely O
to O
live O
through O
it O
or O
not O
. O
" O

  | O
" O
And O
where O
is O
the O
great O
difficulty O
of O
that O
? O
You O
know O
Dr. O
Crockley B-PERSON
would O
come O
at O
a O
moment O
's O

     | O
warning O
at O
any O
time O
, O
and O
feel O
their O
pulses O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
And O
he O
does O
do O
it O
, O
sir O
. O
But O
, O
in O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
place O
, O
I O
doubt O
if O
any O
man O
can O
justly O
tell O
whether O

     | O
girls O
are O
likely O
to O
go O
on O
fainting O
, O
and O
up O
again O
, O
as O
lots O
and O
lots O
of O
'em O
do O
for O
years B-DATE
, O
or O
drop O

     | O
down O
and O
die O
, O
as O
Nancy B-PERSON

did O
. O
That O
's O
one B-CARDINAL
thing O
  O
and O
another O
is O
, O
that O
Dr. O

is O
so O

     | O
fond O
of O
a O
joke O

that O
' O

rarely O

concluded O

this O

     | O
appearance O

She O
looked O

to O
clever O
himself O

very O

     | O
good O

humouredly O
chucked O
the O

replied O
the O
jively O
damsel O
  O
" O
she O
's O
for O
all O

like O

" O

Sir O

on O
hearing O

rather O
white O
about O

about O

suddenly O
recollecting O

himself O

smiled O

ears O
of O
Michael B-PERSON

sufficient O

render O
all O

Sir O

gazed O
at O

a O
sort O

sneer O

which O
, O
if O

     | O
would O
have O

Peggy B-PERSON

little O
delay O

succeeded O

it O
apparent O

that O
Sir O

waiting O
for O
the O
suit O

most O

passion O

exterior O
of O
little O
Michael B-PERSON

the O
nearest O
resemblance O

Considering O
the O
loathing O

manifested O
by O
Sir O

towards O

the O

     | O
poverty O
of O

extraordinary O
to O

the O
amusement O

seemed O
to O
derive O

     | O
from O
dressing O
him O
up O
. O
Though O
the O
alert O
and O
obedient O
Peggy B-PERSON
stood O
close O
by O
to O
do O
his O
pleasure O
, O
it O
|
     | O
was O
his O
own O
large O
hands O
that O
thrust O
the O
little O
limbs O
of O
Michael B-PERSON
into O
the O
clothing O
he O
chose O
they O
|
     | O
should O
wear O
, O
and O
it O
was O
amidst O
shouts O
of O
laughter O
from O
both O
, O
that O
the O
ludicrous O
metamorphosis O

     | O
was O
completed O

But O
somehow O
or O
other O
when O
they O
had O
finished O
their O
masquerading O
work O
, O
the O
result O
was O
not O
|
     | O
altogether O
what O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
anticipated O
. O
The O
clothes O
were O
very O
handsome O
, O
well O
- O
made O
clothes O
, O
and O

     | O
as O
poor O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
notwithstanding O
his O
leanness O
, O
was O
a O
very O
handsome O
, O
wellmade O
boy O
, O
the O
|
     | O
incongruity O
between O
them O
seemed O
to O
vanish O
in O
the O
most O
unaccountable O
manner O
, O
as O
the O
operation O

     | O
drew O
towards O
a O
conclusion O
. O
| 
  | O
Peggy B-PERSON
, O
however O
, O
was O
not O
such O
a O
fool O
as O
not O
to O
understand O
what O
was O
expected O
of O
her O
  O
so O
when O
|
     | O
the O
knight O
, O
catching O
up O
his O
son O
's O
tasselled O
cap O
, O
pressed O
it O
down O
upon O
the O
little O
curly O
head O
as O
|
     | O
a O
lusty O
packer O
of O
worthless O
goods O
thrusts O
down O
the O
cover O
that O
is O
to O
enclose O
them O
, O
and O
then O
|
     | O
pushed O
the O
child O
towards O
her O
with O
an O
impulse O
that O
nearly O
brought O
him O
upon O
his O
nose O
, O
she O
very O
|
     | O
judiciously O
renewed O
her O
noisy O
laughter O
, O
exclaiming O
, O
" O

the O
whole O
of O
the O
undressing O
and O
redressing O
operations O
, O
the O
boy O
's O
cheeks O
had O
been O
dyed O

     | O
with O
blushes O

his O
eyes O
so O
fixedly O

been O
able O

this O
dark O
prophecy O
fell O
on O

him O

looked O
up O

turned O
his O
mocking O
glances O
towards O
the O
servant O

rather O
an O
object O
of O
|
     | O
pity O
than O
of O
admiration O
, O
of O
contempt O
than O
of O
envy O
, O
of O
dislike O
than O
of O
love O
. O
This O
is O
severe O
|
     | O
schooling O
for O
a O
young O
girl O
's O
heart O
, O
but O
if O
it O
produce O
not O
reckless O
indifference O
, O
or O
callous O
|
     | O
insensibility O
, O
it O
often O
purifies O
, O
softens O
, O
and O
even O
elevates O
the O
character O
. O
Such O
were O
its O
|
     | O
effects O
on O
Martha B-PERSON
Dowling I-PERSON
: O
that O
coarse O
- O
seeming O
exterior O
contained O
the O
only O
spark O
of O
refinement O
|
     | O
of O
which O
the O
Dowling B-PERSON
family O
could O
boast O
. O
Never O
did O
a O
high O
- O
born O
Hidalgo B-ORG
, O
in O
Spain B-GPE
's O
proudest O
|
     | O
days O
, O
inculcate O
among O
his O
race O
the O
immeasurable O
importance O
of O
pure O
descent O
, O
with O
more O
ceaseless O
|
     | O
or O
more O
sedulous O
earnestness O
, O
than O
did O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
, O
the O
omnipotence O
of O
wealth O
among O
his O
. O
Every O
|
     | O
child O
was O
taught O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
its O
mind O
became O
capable O
of O
receiving O
the O
important O
truth O
, O
that O
not O
|
     | O
only O
was O
it O
agreeable O
to O
enjoy O
and O
cherish O
all O
the O
good O
things O
which O
wealth O
can O
procure O
, O
but O
|
     | O
that O
it O
was O
their O
bounden O
and O
special O
duty O
to O
make O
it O
visible O
before O
the O
eyes O
of O
all O
men O
that O
|
     | O
they O
could O
, O
and O
that O
they O
did O
, O
have O
more O
money O
spent O
upon O
them O
, O
than O
any O
other O
family O
in O
the O
|
     | O
whole O
country O
  O
but O
Martha B-PERSON
felt O
that O
all O
this O
could O
not O
apply O
to O
her O
. O
| 
  | O
Strange O
to O
say O
, O
the O
only O
tie O
resembling O
affection O
which O
prevented O
the O
total O
isolation O
of O
this O
|
     | O
poor O
girl O
among O
her O
family O
, O
was O
that O
which O
existed O
between O
her O
hard O
- O
natured O
father O
and O
herself O
  O
|
     | O
but O
it O
was O
a O
sentiment O
not O
easy O
to O
analyze O
. O
In O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
it O
probably O
arose O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
from O
his O
|
     | O
having O
been O
told O
that O
the O
little O
girl O
was O
very O
like O
him O
  O
and O
, O
on O
hers O
, O
from O
his O
being O
the O
only O
|
     | O
person O
in O
the O
house O
who O
had O
ever O
bestowed O
a O
caress O
upon O
her O
. O
In O
both O
cases O
, O
cause O
and O
effect O
|
     | O
went O
on O
increasing O
. O
Martha B-PERSON
's O
face O
( O
saving O
its O
expression O
) O
, O
was O
incontrovertibly O
like O
her O
|
     | O
father O
's O
  O
and O
, O
for O
that O
reason O
, O
or O
from O
the O
habit O
it O
had O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
created O
, O
her O
father O
, O
though O
|
     | O
rather O
ashamed O
to O
confess O
it O
, O
was O
certainly O
very O
fond O
of O
her O
. O
| 
   | O
better O
, O
or O
, O
at O
any O
rate O
, O
more O
strongly O
still O
  O
for O
it O
was O
rather O
with O
fanaticism O
|
     | O
than O
devotion O
, O
or O
like O
the O
pitying O
fondness O
with O
which O
a O
mother O
dotes O
on O
a O
deformed O
child O
, O
who O
|
     | O
sees O
only O
that O
because O
it O
is O
less O
loveable O
it O
has O
more O
need O
of O
love O
than O
the O
rest O
. O
|  
  | O
It O
was O
not O
, O
however O
, O
on O
the O
same O
principle O
, O
that O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
's O
affection O
for O
his O
ugly O
|
     | O
daughter O
increased O
as O
years O
rolled O
on O
  O
for O
he O
saw O
, O
that O
though O
as O
a O
child O
she O
had O
been O
like O
|
     | O
him O
, O
she O
was O
now O
grown O
very O
plain O
: O
and O
, O
in O
company O
, O
he O
felt O
almost O
as O
much O
ashamed O
of O
her O
, O
as O
|
     | O
Lady B-PERSON
Dowling I-PERSON
herself O
. O
But O
he O
could O
not O
mistake O
her O
love O
and O
true O
affection O
, O
nor O
resist O
the O
|
     | O
charm O
of O
feeling O
that O
at O
least O
there O
was O
one O
being O
in O
existence O
, O
who O
would O
have O
cherished O
him O
, O
|
     | O
even O
if O
he O
had O
not O
been O
the O
great O
man O
he O
was O
. O
| 
  | O
In O
private O
he O
scrupled O
not O
to O
yield O
to O
this O
feeling O
, O
and O
certainly O
derived O
considerable O
|
     | O
pleasure O
from O
it O
  O
but O
before O
witnesses O
, O
he O
always O
joined O
in O
the O
family O
tone O
respecting O
" O
|
        | O
poor O
Martha B-PERSON
|  | O
, O
" O
and O
scrupled O
not O
to O
push O
her O
on O
one B-CARDINAL
side O
, O
upon O
all O
occasions O
on O
which O
|
     | O
any O
display O
of O
Dowling B-PERSON
elegance O
was O
contemplated O
. O
| 
  | O
It O
was O
this O
ugly O
Martha B-PERSON
Dowling I-PERSON
who O
now O
startled O
little O
Michael B-PERSON
with O
her O
voice O
of O
kindness O
, O
|
     | O
and O
, O
notwithstanding O
all O
her O
lady O
mother O
said O
about O
the O
" O
horrid O
vulgarity O
of O
her O
manners O
, O
" O
poor O
|
     | O
Martha B-PERSON
had O
a O
sweet O
and O
gentle O
voice O
. O
The O
child O
looked O
up O
at O
her O
, O
and O
with O
the O
weakness O
that O
|
     | O
appeared O
constitutionally O
peculiar O
to O
him O
, O
his O
eyes O
were O
immediately O
filled O
with O
tears O
. O
Yet O
|
     | O
Michael B-PERSON
was O
not O
a O
whimpering O
boy O
either O
  O
many O
had O
seen O
him O
harshly O
treated O
, O
for O
he O
had O
worked O
|
     | O
almost O
from O
babyhood O
in O
the O
cotton O
- O
factory O
, O
but O
nobody O
had O
ever O
seen O
him O
cry O
under O
it O
. O
But O
if O
|
     | O
his O
mother O
, O
or O
his O
poor O
sickly O
brother O
, O
touched O
his O
little O
heart O
, O
either O
with O
joy O
or O
|
     | O
tenderness O
, O
he O
would O
weep O
and O
laugh O
both O
, O
with O
very O
infantine O
susceptibility O
. O
So O
it O
was O
with O
|
     | O
him O
now O
, O
for O
when O
Martha B-PERSON
added O
with O
a O
good O
- O
humoured O
smile O
, O
" O
And O
what O
brings O
you O
here O
, O
Master O
|
     | O
Armstrong O
? O
" O
he O
laughed O
outright O
as O
he O
replied O
, O
" O
Indeed O
, O
ma'am O
, O
I O
ai O
n't O
Master B-PERSON
Armstrong I-PERSON
, O
and O
I O

     | O
do O
n't O
know O
a O
bit O
what O
I O
be O
here O
for O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
This O
speech O
, O
though O
addressed O
to O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
being O
heard O
by O
all O
, O
the O
contrast O
between O
his O
|
     | O
appearance O
and O
his O
language O
considerably O
excited O
the O
curiosity O
of O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
eldest O
Miss O
|
     | O
Dowlings B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
" O
La B-WORK_OF_ART
! I-WORK_OF_ART
how O
he O
talks O
! O
I O
thought O
he O
was O
a O
gentleman O
by O
his O
jacket O
, O
did O
n't O
you O
, O
Arabella B-PERSON
? O
" O
said O
|
     | O
Miss B-PERSON
Harriet I-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Yes O
to O
be O
sure O
I O
did O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
eldest O
sister O
. O
" O
But O
I O
am O
sure O
he O
is O
|  | O
not O

, O
with O
|
     | O
that O
horrid O
way O
of O
speaking O
, O
what O
did O
you O
bring O
him O
here O
for O
Peggy B-PERSON
? O
" O
continued O
the O
young O
lady O
|
     | O
with O
an O
air O
of O
authority O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Because O
master O
bid O
me O
, O
miss O
, O
" O
was O
the O
satisfactory O
reply O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Well O
to O
be O
sure O
, O
that O
is O
queer O
! O
I O
suppose O
he O
's O
the O
son O
of O

papa O
would O

     | O
never O
have O
sent O
him O
in O
to O
us O
. O
It O
is O
not O
at O
all O
his O
way O
to O
patronise O
vulgarity O
. O
Where O
do O
you O
|
     | O
live O
, O
young O
gentleman O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
Michael B-PERSON
looked O
very O
much O
as O
if O
he O
were O
in O
danger O
of O
laughing O
again O
, O
but O
he O
did O
not O
, O
and O
|
     | O
replied O
very O
demurely O
, O
" O
in O
Mr. O

back O

lane O

" O
| 
   | O
to O
Martha B-PERSON
as O
he O
uttered O
it O
, O
as O
if O
anxious O
to O
see O
how O
she O
bore O
it O
, O
but O
he O
|
     | O
encountered O
a O
look O
that O
altogether O
puzzled O
him O
  O
for O
though O
it O
was O
at O
least O
as O
kind O
as O
before O
, O
|
     | O
there O
was O
uneasiness O
in O
it O
, O
and O
she O
looked O
round O
her O
, O
as O
if O
uncomfortably O
doubtful O
of O
what O

     | O
would O
happen O
next O
. O

She O
did O
not O

however O
, O
wait O
long O
for O
the O
result O
  O
for O
Miss O

the O

had O
approached O
very O
near O
to O
the O
little O

     | O
boy O
, O
and O
were O
even O
growing O
so O
familiar O
that O
Miss O
Charlotte B-PERSON
had O
taken O
hold O
of O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
his O
dark O

     | O
curls O
, O
were O
severally O
and O
suddenly O
drawn O
off O
by O
the O
respective O
hands O
of O
their O
two B-CARDINAL
eldest O

" O

" O

at O
length O
the O
knight O

     | O
turning O
to O
the O

You O
have O
dressed O
up O
the O
little O

so O
superbly O

that O
nothing O

there O
is O
some O
difference O

Sir O

looking O

with O
most O

complacency O
on O
the O

with O
the O
condition O

, O
that O
the O

upon O

appearance O
of O

And O
why O
not O
? O
It O
is O
quite O
natural O
— O
perfectly O
conformable O
to O
the O

     | O
analogy O
, O
that O
, O
by O
accurately O

a O
head O

" O

The O
little O

knew O
that O

one B-CARDINAL

of O
the O
soft O
points O
at O
which O
his O
wealthy O

     | O
neighbour O
was O
assailable O

Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
loved O
to O
be O
assured O
that O

the O
intelligent O

Before O
he O
replied O
to O
this O

the O
knight O
exchanged O
a O
glance O
with O
his O

     | O
friend O

which O
seemed O
to O

the O

with O
a O
sort O
of O
pomposity O

seemed O

quietly O

" O

  | O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
assured O
him O
that O
he O
did O
, O
very O
much O
  O
and O
then O
pulling O
a O
Belinda B-NORP

the O
olive O

coloured O

taken O

| 
  | O
Whilst O
the O
French B-NORP
governess O
struggled O
to O
find O
a O
word O
sufficiently O
expressive O
of O
admiration O
, O

     | O
and O
if O
possible O
, O
with O
some O
little O
meaning O
besides O
, O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
took O
the O
liberty O
of O
pinching O
her O

     | O
ear O
, O
while O
he O
whispered O
into O
it O
, O
" O

, O
you O
little O
rogue O
? O
what O
? O
" O
| 
   | O
She O
gave O
him O
a O
Parisian B-NORP

æillade O

demanded O
" O

  | O
This O
question O
, O
repeated O
nearly O
in O
the O
same O
words O
by O
Mademoiselle O
Beaujoie B-PERSON
to O
the O
knight O
, O
|
     | O
appeared O
to O
cause O
him O
some O
perplexity O
, O
and O
, O
after O
reflecting O
upon O
it O
for O
a B-TIME
minute I-TIME
, O
he O
turned O
to O

     | O
consult O
his O
philosophical O
friend O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
say O
Crockley B-PERSON
, O
what O
do O
you O
think O
of O
that O
? O
" O
Then O
lowering O
his O
voice O
, O
he O
added O
, O
" O

replied O
his O

in O
the O

low O

very O
decisively O

Lady B-PERSON
Dowling I-PERSON
raised O
her O
light O
eyebrows O
, O
and O
her O
still O
lighter O
eyelashes O
, O
into O
a O
look O
of O
the O

     | O
most O
unmitigated O
astonishment O
, O
and O
remained O
thus O
for O
a O
while O
, O
contemplating O
the O
extraordinary O

     | O
spectacle O
, O
of O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
handsomest O
boys O

had O
ever O
seen O
, O
dressed O
in O
a O

of O

     | O
unquestionable O
fashion O

presented O

so O
deplorably O
miserable O
, O
as O
to O
have O

     | O
excited O
the O
pity O
of O
her O
husband O

The O
first B-ORDINAL
clear O
and O
distinct O
idea O
that O
suggested O
itself O
was O
, O
|
     | O
the O
necessity O
of O
inquiring O
respecting O
this O
beautiful O
child O
's O
mother O
, O
and O
of O
finding O
out O
whether O

     | O
she O
might O
not O
happen O
to O
be O
beautiful O
too O
  O
the O
next O
arose O
from O
the O
sudden O
recognition O
of O
her O
own O

     | O
son O
's O
own O
clothes O
, O
and O
the O
complexion O
of O
the O
lady O

extremely O
florid O

" O

" O
I O
should O
like O

know O
where O

got O
those O

she O
said O
in O
accents O
that O
by O
no O
means O

     | O
spoke O
composure O
of O
spirit O

  | O
" O
My O

replied O
the O
most O

polite O
of O

Sir O

seating O
himself O

accompanied O
the O

act O
by O
a O
sound O
, O
something O
between O
a O
slight O
cough O

a O
grunt O
, O
which O
, O
in O
language O

was O
known O

Whereupon O
, O
Lady O

     | O
Dowling B-PERSON
sat O
down O

her O
fair O
complexion O
was O
rather O
more O

it O

was O
in O

Martha B-PERSON
was O
, O
in O
general O
, O
very O
philosophically O
inclined O

all O
things O
round O
her O
take O
their O

she O
sat O
exactly O
opposite O
to O
the O
object O
of O
her O
father O

benevolence O
, O
and O
there O
was O

     | O
something O
in O
the O
expression O
of O
his O
eye O
, O
as O
it O
rested O
upon O
the O
dainties O
before O
him O
, O
that O
was O

     | O
more O
than O
she O
could O
bear O

" O

I O
give O

raising O
his O

he O
answered O
the O
petition O

by O

added O

perceiving O
that O
her O

     | O
conversation O
with O

knight O

now O
reduced O
to O
a O

no O

few O
of O
the O
amiable O
inquiries O

there O
having O
twice O

now O
that O
Dr. O

called O
upon O

do O
something O

might O
bring O
him O

     | O
into O
notice O

and O
waddling O
up O
to O
the O
young O
poet O

he O
addressed O
him O
with O
an O
air O
of O
incipient O
|
     | O
friendship O

seemed O
to O
say O
, O
" O

somebody O

find O

such O
gifts O

knot O

little O

not O
altogether O
uncongenial O

myself O

I O
may O
venture O
to O
say O

that O
I O
am O

warmly O

     | O
devoted O
to O
every O
subject O

directly O

the O
sultry O

made O
itself O
felt O
under O
the O
exertion O

Dr. O

found O
it O
necessary O

far O
to O
remember O
the O
viler O
portion O
of O

This O

the O

forsook O

sunk O
as O

but O
did O
not O
succeed O
in O
producing O
the O

  O
so O
contented O
himself O

     | O
by O
letting O
the O

drop O

behaved O
like O

remembered O

the O

told O

their O

     | O
morsel O

he O
walked O
manfully O
along O
beside O
Sir O

when O

reached O
the O

his O

yielded O
it O
to O
him O

with O
scarcely O
any O

Sir O

walked O
some O
steps O
forward O

into O
the O

     | O
then O
standing O
quite O
still O
, O
pointed O
to O
the O
child O
, O

said O

this O
form O

told O
Lady B-PERSON

every O

nothing O

sprung O
from O

ran O
towards O
the O

     | O
" O

words O
were O
audible O
only O
to O
the O
knight O

the O
little O
boy O

but O
as O
the O
latter O
could O

     | O
make O
nothing O
of O
them O
, O
and O
the O
former O
almost O
any O
thing O

pleased O

it O
was O
evident O
that O
the O
lady O

was O
as O
well O

the O
eloquent O
silence O

a O

it O
might O
be O

neither O

perched O

last O

clapped O

vehement O

The O
person O
who O
produced O
this O
very O
powerful O
effect O
was O
a O
lady O
not O
particularly O
distinguished O
|
     | O
either O
by O
wealth O
or O
station O
  O
but O
she O
seemed O
to O
possess O
the O
faculty O
of O
finding O
her O
way O
into O
|
     | O
every O
house O
within O
her O
reach O
, O
whether O
the O
owner O
of O
it O
desired O
her O
presence O
or O
not O
. O
| 
  | O
Mrs. O
Gabberly B-PERSON
was O
the O
widow O
of O
a O
clergyman O
, O
who O
had O
formerly O
been O
vicar O
of O
the O
parish O
of O
St. B-FAC

     | I-FAC
Mary I-FAC

, O
Ashleigh B-PERSON
, O
and O
having O
made O
herself O
the O
very O
largest O
acquaintance O
that O
ever O
was O
enjoyed O
|
     | O
by O
any O
country O
lady O
without O
a O
carriage O
, O
she O
determined O
upon O
continuing O
amongst O
them O
after O
her O
|
     | O
husband O
died O
, O
as O
it O
might O
have O
taken O
her O
, O
she O
said O
, O
more B-DATE
years I-DATE
than O
she O
was O
likely O
to O
live O
, O
|
     | O
before O
she O
could O
expect O
to O
make O
so O
many O
friends O
all O
over O
again O
. O
She O
therefore O
, O
on O
leaving O
the O
|
     | O
vicarage O
, O
contented O
herself O
with O
a O
very O
small O
house O
, O
as O
near O
the O
town O
as O
possible O
, O
and O
went O
on O
|
     | O
very O
much O
as O
she O
had O
done O
before O
, O
only O
having O
one B-CARDINAL
maid O
- O
servant O
instead O
of O
two B-CARDINAL
, O
and O
contenting O

     | O
herself O
with O
a O
donkey O
- O
chair O
and O
a O
very O
little O
boy O
to O

a O
one B-CARDINAL

horse O

     | O
and O
a O
steady O

   | O
of O
St. B-GPE
Mary I-GPE

, O
Ashleigh B-PERSON
, O
was O
far O
enough O
from O
being O
richly O
endowed O
, O
and O
the O
private O
|
     | O
fortune O
of O
the O
late O
incumbent O
not O
such O
as O
to O
enable O
him O
to O
approach O
to O
any O
thing O
like O
an O
|
     | O
equality O
in O
his O
style O
of O
living O
to O
even O
the O
least O
wealthy O
among O
the O
manufacturers O
in O
the O
|
     | O
district O
, O
there O
is O
still O
a O
species O
of O
respect O
for O
the O
profession O
of O
a O
clergyman O
, O
which O
opens O
to O

     | O
him O
and O
his O
family O
the O
houses O
of O
many O
, O
greatly O
their O
superiors O
in O
point O
of O
wealth O
  O
and O
it O
|
     | O
therefore O
pretty O
generally O
depends O
on O
the O
clergy O
themselves O
, O
whether O
they O
are O
on O
intimate O
terms O

     | O
with O

Now O
Mr. O

more O
properly O
speaking O
, O
Mrs. O
Gabberly B-PERSON
, O
who O
in O
strength O
of O
will O
had O
ever O
|
     | O
been O
his O
far O
better O
half O
, O
did O
greatly O
desire O

intimate O
terms O
with O
her O
neighbours O

Rich O

or O
poor O
, O
gentle O
or O
simple O
, O
old O
or O
young O
, O
she O
was O
determined O
to O
be O
intimate O
with O
them O
all O
. O
And O
|
     | O
she O
was O
intimate O
with O
them O
all O
, O
very O
intimate O
. O
One B-CARDINAL
word O
more O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Gabberly B-PERSON
shall O
be O
left O
|
     | O
to O
speak O
for O
herself O
, O
which O
she O
was O
certainly O
able O
to O
do O
, O
with O
as O
little O
impediment O
of O
any O
|
     | O
kind O
, O
as O
most O
people O
. O
Mrs. O
Gabberly B-PERSON
was O
the O
daughter O
of O
a O
physician O
  O
and O
from O
her O
earliest O
|
     | O
years O
had O
acquired O
so O
decided O
a O
taste O
for O
the O
theory O
and O
practice O
of O
medicine O
, O
that O
she O
could O
|
     | O
never O
wean O
herself O
entirely O
from O
it O
, O
but O
was O
thought O
by O
many O
to O
let O
it O
still O
occupy O
rather O
too O
|
     | O
large O
a O
share O
of O
her O
conversation O
and O
thoughts O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
Mrs. O
Gabberly B-PERSON
was O
exceedingly O
|
     | O
popular O
, O
for O
though O
her O
discourse O
ran O
much O
upon O
bruises O
and O
bowels O
, O
rickets O
and O
rheums O
, O
spasms O
|
     | O
and O
spines O
, O
it O
ran O
also O
upon O
matters O
more O
attractive O
. O
If O
she O
could O
not O
tell O
what O
every O
body O
for O
|
     | O
three B-QUANTITY
miles I-QUANTITY
round O
had O
for O
dinner O
on O
the B-DATE
very I-DATE
day I-DATE
on O
which O
she O
was O
speaking O
, O
it O
was O
a B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
to O
|
     | O
one O
but O
she O
could O
tell O
, O
within O
a O
cutlet O
or O
a O
hash O
, O
what O
they O
had O
been O
all O
eating O
for O
a B-DATE
week I-DATE
|
     | O
before O
. O
She O
knew O
, O
with O
an O
approach O
to O
correctness O
that O
was O
perfectly O
astonishing O
, O
the O
amount O
of O
|
     | O
every O
body O
's O
expenditure O
, O
and O
every O
body O
's O
debts O
  O
could O
tell O
to O
the O
fraction O
of O
a O
new O
ribbon O
, O
|
     | O
how O
many O
bonnets O
each O
lady O
consumed O
per O
annum O
  O
and O
was O
perfectly O
|  | O
au O
fait O
|  | O
of O
the O
|
     | O
quantity O
of O
corn O
and O
hay O
got O
through O
in O
every O
body O
's O
stables O
. O
No O
flirtation O
ever O
escaped O
either O
|
     | O
her O
eyes O
or O
her O
tongue O
, O
and O
the B-ORG
Morning I-ORG
Post I-ORG
was O
a O
less O
faithful O
record O
of O
fine O
parties O
, O
than O
|
     | O
the O
tablets O
of O
her O
comprehensive O
memory O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
Dowling B-PERSON
family O
was O
aware O
of O
all O
this O
  O
and O
each O
in O
their O
way O
had O
a O
peculiar O
value O
for O
her O
|
     | O
society O
, O
for O
Mrs. O
Gabberly B-PERSON
knew O
how O
to O
be O
all O
things O
to O
all O
men O
, O
women O
, O
and O
children O
  O
but O
, O
at O
|
     | O
the O
present O
moment O
, O
it O
was O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
who O
felt O
the O
most O
decided O
movement O
of O
satisfaction O
at O
|
     | O
beholding O
her O
sharp O
black O
eyes O
, O
brisk O
step O
, O
and O
eager O
manner O
of O
reconnoitring O
every O
individual O
|
     | O
present O
, O
as O
she O
entered O
the O
room O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Here O
is O
my O
general O
advertiser O
, O
" O
thought O
the O
knight O
, O
as O
he O
extended O
his O
huge O
hand O
to O
welcome O
|
     | O
her O
. O
" O
We O
will O
have O
a O
theatrical O
representation O
that O
shall O
immortalize O
my O
charity O
, O
and O
here O
's O

     | O
the O
one O
that O
shall O
act O
the O
part O
of O
Fame B-PERSON
, O
and O
trumpet O
it O
round O
the O
country O
. O
" O
| 
   | O
that O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
continued O
his O
cordial O
hand O
- O
shaking O
. O
" O
Now O
you O
must O
just O
tell O
me O

     | O
what O
you O
are O
all O
about O

for O
if O
you O

" O
No O

if O

can O
save O
your O
life O

" O
replied O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
, O
in O
|
     | O
his O
most O
jovial O
tone O
. O
" O
We O
are O
a O
gay O

happy O
party O

at O
this O
moment O

     | O
all O
, O
" O
and O
here O
the O
knight O
thought O
proper O
to O
send O
a O
glance O
after O
little O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
who O
, O
|
     | O
notwithstanding O
his O
fine O
clothes O
, O
was O
looking O
pale O
and O
sad O
enough O
, O
in O
the O
most O
distant O
corner O
|
     | O
from O
the O
principal O
group O
to O
which O
he O
had O
been O
able O
to O
creep O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
experienced O
eye O
of O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
read O
past O
suffering O
and O
present O
terror O
in O
his O
speaking O
|
     | O
features O
, O
and O
he O
cursed O
the O
trembling O
child O
in O
his O
heart O
of O
hearts O
. O
But O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling I-PERSON
|
     | O
might O
have O
removed O
as O
many O
coatings O
as O
the O
grave O
- O
digger O
in O
Hamlet B-WORK_OF_ART
, O
ere O
the O
looker O
- O
on O
could O
have O
|
     | O
penetrated O
so O
far O
  O
and O
it O
must O
have O
been O
a O
quick O
observer O
that O
could O
have O
detected O
the O
sort O
of O
|
     | O
lurid O
glare O
that O
for O
half B-CARDINAL
an O
instant O
gleamed O
in O
the O
savage O
look O
he O
cast O
upon O
the O
boy O
. O
It O
was O
|
     | O
for O
no O
longer O
space O
that O
his O
joyous O
gaiety O
was O
obscured O
, O
and O
he O
then O
turned O
again O
his O
admiring O
|
     | O
glances O
upon O
the O
Lady O
Clarissa B-PERSON
, O
and O
resumed O
his O
speech O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
This O
is O
the O
person O
, O
Mrs. O
Gabberly B-PERSON

who O
must O
let O
you O
into O
the O
mystery O
. O
You O
must O
entreat O
her O

     | O
ladyship O
to O
be O
pleased O
to O
inform O
you O

" O
Well O

I O
hope O
her O

" O

" O
No O

replied O
Lady O
Clarissa B-PERSON
smiling O
complacently O
on O
the O
knight O

" O

here O
glances O

the O
knight O

the O
lady O

perfectly O

here O
Lady O

her O

round O

     | O
in O
a O
tone O
of O
great O
theatrical O
feeling O

while O
, O
in O
truth O
, O
it O
forcibly O
impelled O

forward O

" O
Now O

Mrs. O

Dowling B-FAC

She O

     | O
paused O
for O
one B-CARDINAL
moment O
, O
however O
, O
as O
she O
passed O
by O
Michael B-PERSON
  O
and O
putting O
her O
hand O
upon O
his O
head O

to O
make O
him O
turn O
his O
face O
up O

she O
said O
, O
after O
looking O

very O

     | O
earnestly O
, O

  | O
" O
Well O
now O
, O
for O
a O

child O

sure O
the O
genteelest O
- O
looking O
little O
fellow O
, O
I O
ever O

     | O
did O
see O
  O
but O
, O
perhaps O
that O
may O
be O
owing O
to O
his O
being O
so O
pale O
and O
thin O
, O
which O
is O
certainly O
a O
|
     | O
great O
deal O
more O
elegant O
than O
fatness O

red O
cheeks O

it O

quite O
seem O

" O

do O
assure O
you O

Mrs. O

as O
you O
would O
have O
said O

if O
you O

had O
seen O

dear O
little O
fellow O
eating O
his O
luncheon O
with O
us O
just O
now O
, O
" O
said O
the O
amiable O
Sir O

     | O
Matthew B-PERSON
chucking O
him O
under O
the O
chin O
. O
" O
But O
, O
by O
the O
way O
, O
" O
continued O
the O
merry O
knight O
, O
" O
I O
rather O
|
     | O
suspect O
that O
I O
called O
him O
away O
before O
he O
had O
quite O
finished O
, O
and O
that O

what O
it O
is O
makes O
him O

     | O
look O
so O
doleful O

is O

it O
, O
dear O
? O
Well O
! O
never O
be O
ashamed O
about O
it O

go O
back O
again O
, O
there O
's O
a O

     | O
darling O

and O
do O
n't O
forget O
to O
take O
a O
nice O
bit O
home O
to O
mother O

brother O
— O
d'ye O
hear O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
? O
|
     | O
Pretty O
fellow O
! O
how O
he O
blushes O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
And O
here O
the O
benevolent O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
himself O
opened O
the O
door O
leading O
to O
the O
dining O
- O
room O
, O
and O
|
     | O
playfully O
pushed O
the O
" O
darling O
" O
through O
it O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Well O
now O
! O
" O
again O
exclaimed O
the O
astonished O
Mrs. O
Gabberly B-PERSON
" O
did O
ever O
any O
body O
see O
such O
a O

     | O
beautiful O
spectacle O

charity O
as O
that O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
And O
without O
waiting O
for O
any O
reply O
, O
the O
brisk O
little O
lady O
made O
her O
exit O
without O
further O
pause O
|
     | O
or O
delay O
of O
any O
kind O
, O
and O
so O
completely O
charged O
" O
to O
the O
top O
of O
her O
bent O
" O
with O
wonderful O
|
     | O
intelligence O
, O
that O
she O
actually O
suffered O
from O
the O
repletion O
till O
half B-CARDINAL
a I-CARDINAL
dozen I-CARDINAL
gossippings O
had O
|
     | O
relieved O
it O
. O
| 
  | O
Meanwhile O
, O
the O
party O
she O
left O
resolved O
themselves O
into O
a O
committee O
of O
management O
upon O
the O
|
     | O
business O
in O
hand O
. O
Mr. O
Osmond B-PERSON
Norval I-PERSON
was O
entreated O
to O
urge O
his O
eloquent O
pen O
with O
the O
greatest O
|
     | O
possible O
rapidity O
  O
while O
on O
his O
part O
, O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
promised O
that O
the O
necessary O
workmen O
should O
|
     | O
immediately O
be O
employed O
in O
preparing O
one O
of O
the O
largest O
rooms O
in O
the O
house O
as O
a O
theatre O
. O
| 
  | O
When O
the O
consultation O
reached O
this O
point O
, O
Lady B-PERSON
Dowling I-PERSON
suddenly O
rose O
and O
left O
the O
room O
  O
but O
|
     | O
this O
circumstance O
did O
not O
appear O
to O
produce O
much O
emotion O
in O
any O
of O
the O
party O
, O
and O
they O
remained O
|
     | O
together O
in O
a O
most O
delightful O
state O
of O
hubbub O
and O
excitement O
till O
the O
heiress O
grew O
tired O
, O
and O
|
     | O
ventured O
to O
hint O
that O
she O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
best O
for O
her O
to O
drive O
home O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
and O
then O
send O
|
     | O
her O
carriage O
back O
for O
the O
accommodation O
of O
her O
noble O
friend O
. O
| 
  | O
This O
proposal O
brought O
the O
meeting O
to O
a O
conclusion O
  O
but O
not O
till O
Lady O
Clarissa B-PERSON
had O
confessed O

     | O
in O
a O
whisper O
to O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
, O
that O
she O
never O
in O
her O
whole O

remembered O

taken O
any O

     | O
thing O
that O
did O
her O
so O
much O
good O
, O

     | O
inasmuch O
as O
by O
keeping O
out O
of O
sight O
she O
could O
pretty O
generally O
contrive O
to O
remain O
where O
she O
|
     | O
chose O
, O
and O
do O
what O
she O
liked O
. O
These O
enviable O
privileges O
enabled O
her O
now O
to O
sit O
down O
at O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
|
     | O
the O
large O
open O
windows O
of O
the O
diningroom O
, O
and O
to O
draw O
from O
her O
unseemly O
- O
sized O
pocket O
, O
a O
volume O
|
     | O
of O
Shakspeare B-PERSON
, O
with O
which O
she O
determined O
to O
beguile O
the O
time O
till O
the O
boy O
should O
return O
, O
or O
|
     | O
till O
by O
some O
means O
or O
other O
, O
she O
might O
be O
able O
to O
discover O
what O
had O
become O
of O
him O
. O
| 
  | O
When O
therefore O
, O
impelled O
by O
the O
playful O
, O
but O
very O
effectual O
impulse O
of O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
's O
shove O
, O
|
     | O
Michael B-PERSON
once O
more O
entered O
the O
dining O
- O
parlour O
, O
he O
had O
the O
satisfaction O
of O
being O
again O
greeted O
by O
|
     | O
the O
friendly O
eye O
and O
friendly O
voice O
, O
which O
had O
already O
so O
greatly O
cheered O
him O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
So O
, O
here O
you O
are O
again O
, O
my O
little O
man O
, O
" O
said O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
repocketing O
her O
book O
, O
and O
rising O
  O
" O
I O
|
     | O
thought O
you O
would O
hardly O
forget O
the O
basket O
: O
see O
, O
here O
it O
is O
, O
and O
now O
you O
shall O
help O
me O
pack O
|
     | O
it O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
The O
help O
thus O
asked O
for O
, O
was O
afforded O
by O
the O
happy O
child O
's O
holding O
the O
basket O
in O
his O
hand O
, O
as O
|
     | O
he O
followed O
her O
round O
the O
table O
, O
while O
with O
a O
smile O
that O
spoke O
as O
much O
pleasure O
as O
his O
own O
, O
she O
|
     | O
selected O
all O
sorts O
of O
good O
things O
to O
put O
into O
it O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
There O
! O
now O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
we O
can O
put O
in O
any O
more O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
  O
so O
set O
off O
, O
and O
carry O
it O
to O
your O
|
     | O
mother O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
With O
eyes O
beaming O
rapture O
, O
and O
little O
hands O
that O
trembled O
with O
delight O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
closed O
the O
|
     | O
lid O
of O
the O
basket O
, O
and O
proceeded O
towards O
the O
door O
  O
but O
ere O
he O
had O
fully O
reached O
it O
, O
he O
stopped O
|
     | O
short O
, O
and O
addressing O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
tone O
as O
fearless O
and O
confidential O
as O
if O
she O
had O
been O
his O
|
     | O
sister O
, O
he O
said O
, O
| 
  | O
" O
But O
what O
d'ye O
think O
about O
Teddy B-PERSON
? O
Might O
n't O
I O
change O
into O
my O
old O
clothes O
again O
, O
and O
just O
step O

     | O
into O
the O
factory O
for O
one B-TIME
minute I-TIME
? O
Teddy B-PERSON
ca O
n't O
almost O
never O
eat O
the O
dinner O
as O
we O
takes O
to O
the O

     | O
factory O
, O
and O
a O
bit O
of O
this O
would O
do O
him O
so O
much O
good O
! O
— O
May O
I O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Upon O
my O
word O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
I O
am O
rather O
puzzled O
what O
to O
say O
, O
" O
replied O
his O
friend O
  O
" O
as O
papa O
has O
|
     | O
ordered O
you O
to O
have O
these O
clothes O
, O
he O
might O
not O
be O
pleased O
at O
your O
taking O
them O
off O
again O
, O
and O
|
     | O
it O
would O
be O
a O
great O
pity O
to O
make O
him O
angry O
with O
you O
when O
he O
is O
so O
very O
good O
and O
kind O
, O
would O
n't O
|
     | O
it O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
Michael B-PERSON
hung O
his O
head O
, O
and O
said O
nothing O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
But O
why O
need O
you O
change O
your O
clothes O
, O
my O
dear O
boy O
? O
— O
I O
dare O
say O
Teddy B-PERSON
would O
be O
very O
proud O
to O
|
     | O
see O
you O
look O
so O
nice O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Still O
Michael B-PERSON
answered O
not O
, O
but O
began O
assiduously O
picking O
to O
pieces O
the O
handle O
of O
Martha B-PERSON
's O
|
     | O
delicate O
basket O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Do O
n't O
do O
that O
, O
dear O
, O
" O
said O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
approaching O
, O
and O
taking O
the O
offending O
hand O
in O
hers O
  O
" O
but O
|
     | O
tell O
me O
what O
you O
are O
thinking O
about O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
am O
thinking O
, O
" O
said O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
" O
that O
if O
I O
walked O
into O
the O
midst O
of O
'em O
this O
way O
, O
and O
up O
to O
|
     | O
poor O
Teddy O
, O
in O
his O
dirty O
ragged O
clothes O
, O
it O
would O
look O
" O
— O

here O
he O
stopped O
without O
finishing O

     | O
the O
sentence O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
It O
would O
look O
, O
how O
? O
— O
as O
if O
you O
were O
proud O
, O
perhaps O
? O
" O
said O
Martha B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
The O
child O
shook O
his O
head O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
No O
, O
not O
that O
. O
Teddy O
would O
not O
think O
that O
, O
" O
he O
replied O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
What O
would O
he O
think O
, O
then O
? O
— O
Tell O
me O
all O
that O
is O
passing O
in O
your O
little O
head O
, O
and O
then O
I O

     | O
shall O
be O
able O
to O
advise O
you O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Why O
, O
he O
'd O
think O
, O
" O
said O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
and O
tears O
started O
as O
he O
spoke O
— O
" O
he O
'd O
think O
that O
he O
and O
I O

     | O
could O
never O
be O
right O
down O
brothers O
any O
more O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Martha B-PERSON
involuntarily O
kissed O
the O
little O
face O
that O
was O
turned O
up O
to O
hers O
, O
but O
replied O
, O
|
     | O
laughingly O
, O
| 
  | O
" O
Oh O
! O
that O
's O
foolish O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
  O
do O
you O
think O
that O
a O
fine O
jacket O
could O
separate O
two B-CARDINAL
little O
|
     | O
brothers O
that O
love O
each O
other O
? O
— O
I O
think O
I O
could O
love O
you O
quite O
as O
well O
in O
a O
shabby O
coat O
, O
as O
in O
|
     | O
a O
fine O
one O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Michael B-PERSON
looked O
at O
her O
very O
earnestly O
for O
a B-TIME
minute I-TIME
or O
two B-CARDINAL
, O
and O
then O
said O
, O
almost O
in O
a O
whisper O
, O
|
     | O
" O
Is O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling I-PERSON
, O
as O
owns O
our O
factory O
, O
your O
father O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Yes O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
" O
replied O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
colouring O
from O
some O
painful O
feeling O
which O
the O
expression O
of O
|
     | O
the O
boy O
's O
speaking O
features O
had O
given O
rise O
to O
. O
The O
child O
coloured O
too O
, O
but O
said O
, O
with O
good O
|
     | O
courage O
, O
| 
  | O
" O
Please O
, O
ma'am O
, O
I O
should O
love O
Teddy B-PERSON
just O
as O
well O
, O
and O
Teddy B-PERSON
would O
love O
me O
, O
only O
the O
others O

may O

mock O
at O
him O

me O
too O

I O
know O
Teddy B-PERSON
could O
not O
bear O
it O

" O

  | O
" O
Then O
they O
would O
not O
be O
as O
good O
children O
as O
I O
think O
you O
are O

But O
tell O
me O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
something O

     | O
about O
the O
mill O
: O
papa O
has O
never O
let O
us O
see O
it O
yet O
, O
but O
I O
believe O
it O
is O
only O
because O
mamma O
thinks O

     | O
it O
is O
a O
dirty O
place O

Is O
it O
very O
dirty O

Michael B-PERSON

and O
Teddy B-LAW
eighteen I-LAW

" O
That O

not O
much O

Michael B-PERSON

said O

laughing O

" O

something O

" O

  | O
" O
Yes O
, O
ma'am O
, O
" O
said O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
but O
in O
so O
low O
a O
tone O
, O
that O
it O
was O
as O
much O
as O
Martha B-PERSON
could O
do O
to O
|
     | O
hear O
it O
  O
and O
so O
melancholy O
a O
look O
accompanied O
the O
words O
, O
that O
she O
could O
not O
help O
thinking O
there O

     | O
was O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
truth O
in O
what O
she O
had O
constantly O
heard O
repeated O
by O
most O
of O
her O
father O
's O
|
     | O
friends O
and O
neighbours O
, O
as O
well O
as O
himself O
— O
namely O
, O
that O
the O
factory O
children O
were O
a O
race O
of O
|
     | O
very O
idle O
, O
ungrateful O
little O
creatures O
  O
spoilt O
by O
the O
high O
wages O
and O
indulgence O
they O
received O
, O
|
     | O
and O
quite O
unconscious O
of O
the O
inestimable O
advantages O
they O
possessed O
over O
all O
the O
other O
children O

     | O
in O
the O
British B-NORP
dominions O
. O
| 
  | O
But O
, O
nevertheless O
, O
though O
this O
disagreeable O
conviction O
pressed O
very O
painfully O
upon O
her O
, O
|
     | O
Martha B-PERSON
could O
not O
help O
feeling O
very O
kindly O
disposed O
towards O
little O
Michael B-PERSON
  O
and O
upon O
his O
|
     | O
presently O
saying O
, O
" O
Shall O
I O
go O
to O
mother O

Teddy B-PERSON
, O
if O
you O

" O
she O
almost O
forgot O
all O

     | O
the O
naughtiness O
she O
attributed O
to O
him O

his O
fraternity O

and O
only O
remembering O
the O
disadvantage O

     | O
that O
any O
disobedience O
to O
her O
father O
's O
wishes O
might O
bring O
upon O
him O

" O

So O
saying O

she O
left O

room O
, O
and O
having O
ascertained O
that O
the O
visiters O
were O
gone O
, O
ventured O
to O
|
     | O
seek O
her O
father O
in O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
  O
where O
she O
found O
him O
deep O
in O
consultation O
with O
Dr. O
|
     | O
Crockley O
, O
his O
two B-CARDINAL
eldest O
daughters O
, O
and O
his O
son O
, O
as O
to O
the O
possibility O
of O
converting O
the O
|
     | O
school O
- O
room O
into O
a O
theatre O
: O
all O
being O
of O
opinion O
that O
the O
great O
drawing O
- O
room O
must O
be O
reserved O
|
     | O
for O
the O
ball O
, O
and O
the O
dining O
- O
room O
for O
the O
supper O
, O
which O
it O
was O
agreed O
on O
all O
sides O
must O
follow O
|
     | O
the O
representation O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
May O
I O
speak O
to O
you O
, O
papa O
? O
" O
said O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
timidly O
, O
on O
perceiving O
that O
the O
whole O
party O
were O
|
     | O
exceedingly O
earnest O
upon O
some O
theme O
or O
other O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Oh O
! O
goodness O
, O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
do O
n't O
come O
to O
plague O
us O
now O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
Arabella B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
" O
It O
is O
very O
odd O
, O
but O
Martha B-PERSON
always O
does O
come O
in O
the O
way O
of O
every O
thing O
, O
" O
said O
Harriet B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
wish O
you O
were O
married O
or O
buried O
, O
child O
! O
" O
cried O
the O
lively O
Augustus B-PERSON
  O
" O
for O
you O
make O
a O
|
     | O
monstrous O
bad O
had O
at O
playing O
the O
young O
lady O
of O
fashion O
. O
Upon O
my O
life O
you O
grow O
fatter O
every O
day O
. O
|
     | O
Does O
n't O
she O
, O
doctor O
? O
I O
wish O
you O
would O
dose O
her O
a O
little O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
That O
Miss O
Martha B-PERSON
is O
a O
little O
opaque O
, O
I O
will O
not O
deny O
, O
" O
replied O
Dr. O
Crockley B-PERSON
, O
familiarly O
|
     | O
coming O
behind O
her O
, O
and O
measuring O
the O
expanse O
of O
her O
waist O
with O
his O
two B-CARDINAL
hands O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
May O
I O
speak O
to O
you O
, O
papa O
? O
" O
repeated O
the O
patient O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
quietly O
retreating O
from O
the O
jocose O
|
     | O
hands O
of O
Dr. O
Crockley B-PERSON
, O
but O
apparently O
quite O
insensible O
to O
all O
the O
other O
attacks O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
What O
do O
you O
want O
to O
say O
, O
Martha B-PERSON
? O
" O
demanded O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
Thus O
much O
encouraged O
, O
she O
drew O
near O
and O
whispered O
to O
him O
, O
" O
The O
little O
boy O
that O
you O
have O
taken O
|
     | O
in O
, O
papa O
, O
wants O
to O
know O
if O
he O
may O
put O
on O
his O
old O
clothes O
again O
, O
and O
go O
to O
speak O
to O
his O
brother O

     | O
in O
the O
factory O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Do O
you O
hear O
this O
, O
doctor O
? O
" O
exclaimed O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
  O
" O
the O
boy O
wants O
to O
go O
back O
to O
the O
factory O

     | O
again O
. O
Is O
n't O
that O
an O
answer O
to O
all O
the O
trash O
that O
people O
have O
been O
trying O
to O
get O
up O
about O

It O
is O
just O
like O
'em O

that O
's O
the O
very O
model O
of O
a O
factory O
child O
— O
do O
what O
you O

     | O
will O
, O
you O
can O
never O
content O

" O
The O
chap O
want O

to O
get O
back O
to O
the O
factory O

" O
said O
Dr. O
Crockley B-PERSON
, O
addressing O
himself O
to O
|
     | O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
with O
an O
accent O
that O
indicated O
surprise O
. O
" O
That O
's O
curious O
enough O
, O
any O
how O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
No O
, O
sir O
, O
I O
do O
not O
believe O
he O
wants O
to O
do O
any O
more O
than O
speak O
to O
his O
brother O
, O
who O
is O
at O
work O
|
     | O
there O
— O
he O
wanted O
to O
take O
him O
something O
that O
was O
left O
at O
luncheon O
, O
papa O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
And O
to O
show O
off O
his O
own O
good O
living O
to O
the O
factory O
? O
That O
's O
it O
, O
I O
suspect O
, O
doctor O
  O
one O
can O
|
     | O
understand O
that O
— O
and O
what O
do O
you O
say O
to O
it O
? O
I O
should O
have O
no O
objection O
, O
I O
think O
  O
what O
's O
your O
|
     | O
opinion O
? O
only O
I O
do O
n't O
see O
the O
fun O
of O
his O
going O
in O
his O
old O
rags O
, O
if O
he O
went O
as O
you O
saw O
him O
just O
|
     | O
now O
, O
it O
would O
make O
some O
fun O
, O
would O
n't O
it O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Capital O
, O
by O
Jove B-PERSON
! O
" O
replied O
the O
doctor O
. O
" O
How O
quick O
you O
are O
, O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
! O
you O
seize O
every O

     | O
thing O
in O
a O
moment O
. O
What O
do O
you O
say O
to O
our O
going O
along O
with O
him O
? O
Might O
n't O
we O
catch O
a O
hint O
or O
|
     | O
two B-CARDINAL
, O
as O
to O
how O
things O
were O
going O
on O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
If O
I O
'm O
quick O
, O
Crockley B-GPE
, O
upon O
my O
soul O
you O
are O
not O
slow O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
knight O
. O
" O
You O
've O
got O
your O
|
     | O
horse O
here O
, O
of O
course O

" O
The O
doctor O
nodded O
assent O
. O
" O
Then O
I O
will O
order O
mine O
, O
and O
we O
'll O
ride O
down O

     | O
to O
the O
mill O
together O
. O
So O
get O
along O
, O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
and O
tell O
the O
boy O
that O
I O
will O
take O
him O
to O
the O
|
     | O
factory O
with O
me O
, O
but O
that O
he O
is O
not O
to O
change O
his O
clothes O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Martha B-PERSON
felt O
quite O
aware O
that O
she O
had O
not O
executed O
her O
commission O
successfully O
. O
But O
there O
was O
|
     | O
no O
help O
for O
it O
, O
and O
therefore O
with O
the O
best O
grace O
she O
could O
, O
she O
told O
her O
little O
client O
the O
|
     | O
result O
of O
it O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
whole O
aspect O
of O
the O
boy O
changed O
as O
he O
heard O
it O
, O
and O
, O
as O
if O
instinctively O
, O
he O
placed O
the O
|
     | O
precious O
basket O
, O
that O
till O
now O
he O
had O
continued O
to O
hold O
firmly O
in O
his O
hand O
, O
upon O
a O
table O
near O
|
     | O
him O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
But O
take O
your O
basket O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
the O
kind O
- O
hearted O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
voice O
that O
was O
intended O
|
     | O
to O
cheer O
him O
  O
" O
I O
am O
sure O
papa O
wo O
n't O
be O
angry O
at O
your O
doing O
that O
, O
for O
I O
told O
him O
about O
it O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
No O
, O
please O
ma'am O
, O
I O
'd O
rather O
not O
, O
" O
said O
Michael B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Well O
, O
then O
, O
go O
into O
the O
hall O
, O
by O
that O
door O
, O
and O
wait O
till O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
comes O
through O
. O
Perhaps O
|
     | O
he O
will O
speak O
to O
you O
about O
it O
, O
and O
at O
any O
rate O
you O
had O
better O
carry O
it O
as O
far O
as O
that O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
The O
child O
obeyed O
her O
, O
and O
taking O
up O
again O
the O
treasure O
he O
no O
longer O
valued O
, O
passed O
out O
into O
|
     | O
the O
hall O
  O
but O
before O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
and O
his O
friend O
entered O
it O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
had O
put O
the O
worthless O
|
     | O
basket O
out O
of O
sight O
. O
| 
  | O
Hardly O
had O
he O
done O
so O
, O
when O
he O
heard O
the O
coarse O
laugh O
of O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
and O
the O
respondent O
|
     | O
titter O
of O
the O
doctor O
approaching O
. O
The O
little O
fellow O
started O
, O
and O
jumped O
aside O
, O
in O
order O
to O
|
     | O
place O
himself O
out O
of O
their O
way O
  O
but O
the O
knight O
, O
striding O
to O
the O
place O
where O
he O
stood O
, O
seized O
|
     | O
him O
by O
the O
shoulder O
with O
his O
hand O
, O
while O
with O
a O
vigorous O
action O
of O
his O
enormous O
foot O
, O
he O
sent O
|
     | O
him O
forward O
towards O
the O
house O
- O
door O
. O
This O
feat O
, O
which O
was O
performed O
with O
considerable O
dexterity O
, O
|
     | O
met O
its O
reward O
, O
in O
the O
shout O
of O
laughter O
with O
which O
Dr. O
Crockley B-PERSON
welcomed O
it O
. O
" O
By O
Jove B-PERSON
, O
Sir O
|
     | O
Matthew B-PERSON
! O
" O
he O
exclaimed O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
had O
recovered O
his O
breath O
  O
" O
there O
is O
nothing O
like O
you O
on O

     | O
the O
face O
of O
God O

earth O

— O
It O
is O
a O
confounded O
monopoly O

, O
let O
me O
tell O
you O

No O
man O

a O

right O
to O
be O
the O
deepest O
reasoner O

the O
most O
finished O
man O
of O
taste O
of O
his O

     | O
age O

It O
's O
monstrous O

Sir O
knight O

a O
conspiracy O
against O
you O
would O
be O
a O
very O
honest O
plot O

" O

  | O
And O
as O
he O
spoke O
he O
held O
his O
sides O
, O
as O
if O
still O
suffering O
from O
the O
effects O
of O
his O
excessive O

     | O
merriment O
. O
| 
  | O
A O
servant O
who O
followed O
the O
facetious O
pair O
now O
opened O
the O
door O
, O
and O
on O
the O
broad O
esplanade O
of O

     | O
gravel O
before O
it O
a O
couple O
of O
grooms O
were O
holding O
the O
gentlemen O

horses O

As O
soon O
as O
they O
were O

seated O
in O
their O
saddles O
, O
with O
a O
mounted O
attendant O
behind O
them O
, O
the O
great O
manufacturer O
turned O

     | O
round O
his O
head O
to O
seek O
the O
object O
of O
his O
charity O

Michael B-PERSON
stood O
doubting O
and O
trembling O
on O
the O
|
     | O
lowest O
step O
of O
the O
portico O
, O
while O
a O
faint O
hope O
fluttered O
at O
his O
heart O
, O
that O
the O
grand O
gentlemen O

     | O
would O
ride O
away O
and O
forget O
him O
  O
but O
it O
was O
quickly O
chased O
by O
the O
voice O
of O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
, O
who O
, O

     | O
bringing O
his O
horse O
's O
head O
so O
close O
upon O
the O
child O
, O
as O
to O
touch O
him O

while O
he O
seemed O
almost O
to O

     | O
shrink O
into O
the O
pillar O
by O
which O
he O
stood O
, O
to O
escape O
it O

said O
in O
a O
voice O
, O
the O
jeering O
tone O
of O

     | O

again O
almost O
convulsed O
Dr. O

laughter O

, O
for O
the O

     | O
information O
of O
those O

not O

a O
slight O
sketch O
of O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling I-PERSON
's O
establishment O
shall O
|
     | O
be O
given O
. O
| 
  | O
It O
consisted O
of O
very O
extensive O
buildings O
constructed O
in O
the O
centre O
of O
the O
enclosed O
court O
, O
and O
|
     | O
forming O
three B-CARDINAL
sides O
of O
a O
vast O
square O
  O
the O
fourth B-ORDINAL
being O
open O
on O
the O
side O
fronting O
the O
principal O
|
     | O
gates O
of O
entrance O
. O
When O
it O
is O
stated O
that O
the O
edifice O
consisted O
of O
six B-CARDINAL
stories O
, O
and O
that O
each O
|
     | O
side O
of O
it O
presented O
six B-CARDINAL
lines O
of O
windows O
, O
containing O
forty B-CARDINAL
windows O
in O
each O
line O
, O
some O
idea O
of O
|
     | O
its O
magnitude O
may O
be O
conceived O
. O
| 
  | O
Michael B-PERSON
was O
already O
at O
the O
gates O
, O
and O
, O
on O
the O
approach O
of O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
, O
rang O
the O
bell O
  O
a O
|
     | O
ceremony O
necessary O
to O
obtain O
admittance O
both O
for O
masters O
and O
labourers O
  O
no O
means O
of O
entrance O
or O
|
     | O
exit O
being O
ever O
left O
unsecured O
for O
a O
single O
instant O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
summons O
was O
answered O
by O
a O
lame O
boy O
, O
stationed O
within O
to O
perform O
the O
office O
of O
porter O
. O
He O
|
     | O
bent O
low O
before O
the O
great O
man O
, O
and O
low O
too O
before O
his O
jeering O
friend O
  O
though O
the O
jocose B-PERSON
visits O
|
     | O
of O
the O
latter O
to O
the O
factory O
were O
dreaded O
as O
much O
as O
the O
lash O
itself O
. O
| 
  | O
Neither O
the O
one O
nor O
the O
other O
seemed O
to O
see O
him O
, O
but O
passed O
on O
. O
Then O
followed O
poor O
little O
|
     | O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
hating O
most O
cordially O
the O
bravery O
of O
the O
attire O
, O
which O
made O
him O
expect O
to O
meet O
the O
|
     | O
ridicule O
, O
rather O
than O
the O
sympathy O
, O
of O
his O
late O
companions O
. O
| 
  | O
On O
seeing O
a O
young O
stranger O
, O
the O
lame O
porter O
looked O
up O
  O
but O
from O
him O
, O
at O
least O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
had O
|
     | O
nothing O
to O
fear O
  O
for O
the O
boy O
's O
languid O
eye O
surveyed O
his O
altered O
person O
, O
without O
the O
slightest O
|
     | O
suspicion O
of O
ever O
having O
seen O
it O
before O
. O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
, O
like O
most O
others O
of O
his O
craft O
, O
was O
not O
in O
|
     | O
the O
habit O
of O
indulging O
his O
family O
by O
exhibiting O
to O
them O
the O
secret O
arcana O
of O
that O
hideous O
|
     | O
mystery O
by O
which O
the O
delicate O
forms O
of O
young O
children O
are O
made O
to O
mix O
and O
mingle O
with O
the O
|
     | O
machinery O
, O
from O
whence O
flows O
the O
manufacturer O
's O
wealth O
. O
This O
divine O
portion O
of O
the O
vast O
engine O
|
     | O
being O
considered O
, O
however O
, O
as O
a O
very O
inferior O
, O
though O
necessary O
, O
part O
of O
it O
. O
But O
, O
although O
they O
|
     | O
had O
never O
honoured O
the O
premises O
with O
a O
visit O
, O
it O
was O
, O
of O
course O
, O
well O
known O
to O
all O
that O
Sir O
|
     | O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling I-PERSON
was O
the O
father O
of O
a O
numerous O
progeny O
  O
and O
Michael B-PERSON
passed O
on O
amidst O
such O
|
     | O
blessings O
as O
human O
nature O
, O
under O
such O
circumstances O
, O
was O
likely O
to O
bestow O
on O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
. O
| 
   | O
mere O
unfettered O
use O
of O
them O
a O
delight O
, O
are O
banished O
for O
ever O
and O
for O
ever O
. O
The O
|
     | O
ceaseless O
whirring O
of O
a B-QUANTITY
million I-QUANTITY
hissing O
wheels O
, O
seizes O
on O
the O
tortured O
ear O
  O
and O
while O
|
     | O
threatening O
to O
destroy O
the O
delicate O
sense O
, O
seems O
bent O
on O
proving O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
with O
a O
sort O
of O
mocking O
|
     | O
mercy O
, O
of O
how O
much O
suffering O
it O
can O
be O
the O
cause O
. O
The O
scents O
that O
reek O
around O
, O
from O
oil O
, O
|
     | O
tainted O
water O
, O
and O
human O
filth O
, O
with O
that O
last O
worst O
nausea O
, O
arising O
from O
the O
hot O
refuse O
of O
|
     | O
atmospheric O
air O
, O
left O
by O
some B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
pairs O
of O
labouring O
lungs O
, O
render O
the O
act O
of O
breathing O
a O
|
     | O
process O
of O
difficulty O
, O
disgust O
, O
and O
pain O
. O
All O
this O
is O
terrible O
. O
But O
what O
the O
eye O
brings O
home O
to O
|
     | O
the O
heart O
of O
those O
, O
who O
look O
round O
upon O
the O
horrid O
earthly O
hell O
, O
is O
enough O
to O
make O
it O
all O

     | O
forgotten O
  O
for O
who O
can O
think O
of O
villanous O
smells O
, O
or O
heed O
the O
suffering O
of O
the O
earracking O
|
     | O
sounds O
, O
while O
they O
look O
upon O
hundreds B-CARDINAL
of O
helpless O
children O
, O
divested O
of O
every O
trace O
of O
health O
|
     | O
of O
joyousness O
, O
and O
even O
of O
youth O
! O
Assuredly O
there O
is O
no O
exaggeration O
in O
this O
  O
for O
except O
only O
|
     | O
in O
their O
diminutive O
size O
, O
these O
suffering O
infants O

no O

Lean O

distorted O
limbs O

     | O
— O
sallow O

sunken O
cheeks O
— O
dim O

most O
unnatural O

a O
look O
of O
hideous O
premature O

But O
in O
the O

So O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
proudly O
looked O

     | O
about O
him O
, O
and O
approved O
  O
and O
though O
it O
was O
athwart O

in O

such O

dignity O

apt O

, O
Dr. O

failed O
not O
to O
perceive O
, O
that O
his O
friend O

in O
good O
humour O

any O
light O

lively O
jestings O
in O

     | O
which O
he O
might O
indulge O

Perceiving O
, O
therefore O
, O
that O
little O
Michael B-PERSON

on O

downcast O

unrecognised O

Sir O

The O
miserable O

to O
whom O
the O
facetious O

pointed O

It O
was O
a O
sort O
of O
vague O
hope O
that O
something O
comical O

this O

Dr. O

Matthew B-PERSON
perceived O
that O
his O
favourite O
agent O
feared O
to O
enforce O
his O
first B-ORDINAL
brutal O
command O
, O

     | O
and O
was O
forced O
, O
therefore O
, O
to O
content O
himself O
with O
seeing O
the O
oiled O
and O
grimy O
face O
of O
the O

     | O
filthy O

delicate O

looking O
Michael B-PERSON
. O
But O
he O
|
     | O
felt O
he O
had O
been O
foiled O
, O
and O
cast O
a O
glance O
upon O
his O
|  | O
protégé O
|  | O
, O
which O
seemed O
to O
promise O

     | O
that O
he O
would O
not O
forget O
it O
. O

Having O
made O
known O
to O
the O
superintendent O
, O
that O
it O
was O
his O
pleasure O
to O
enter O
the O
room O
where O
the O
|
     | O
brother O
of O
Michael B-PERSON
was O
at O
work O
, O
Mr. O

he O
passed O
up O
, O
to O
be O
opened O
for O
him O

     | O
that O
he O
might O
look O
in O

his O
stifling O
slaves O
, O

satisfy O
himself O
that O
neither O

were O
loitering O
in O
unthrifty O

| 
   | O
Dr. O
Crockley B-PERSON
secretly O
resolved O
, O
that O
when O
making O
the O
final O
arrangements O
for O
his O

     | O
promised O
appointment O
, O
it O
should O
be O
specified O

he O
should O
never O
enter O
the O
working O
portion O
of O

the O

For O
though O
by O
no O
means O
a O
particularly O
scientific O
practitioner O
, O
the O
little O

     | O
doctor O
knew O
quite O
enough O
of O
the O
business O
he O
followed O
, O
to O
be O
aware O
that O
, O
in O
his O

case O
at O

     | O
least O
, O
the O
air O
which O
filled O
it O

could O
not O

breathed O
with O
impunity O

  | O
" O
Now O
then O
, O
sir O
, O
" O
said O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
, O
addressing O
himself O
to O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
while O
Parsons B-PERSON
opened O
the O

     | O
door O
on O
the O
fifth B-ORDINAL

and O
announced O
that O
this O
was O
the O

that O
contained O
Edward B-PERSON

" O
Now O
, O
sir O

     | O
walk O
on O

find O
your O

, O
if O
your O
pride O
does O
not O
stand O
in O
your O
way O
, O
let O
him O
be O
made O

     | O
to O
understand O
all O
the O
extraordinary O
kindness O
I O
have O
shown O
you O
. O
Take O
care O
that O
you O
let O
him O
and O

     | O
all O
his O
companions O
know O
that O
I O
have O
adopted O
you O
as O
one O
of O
my O
own O
family O
  O

that O
henceforward O
, O

they O
will O
always O

you O
dressed O
as O
well O
as O
you O
are O
at O
present O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
All O
that O
Michael B-PERSON
clearly O
understood O
from O
this O
harangue O
was O
, O
that O
he O
had O
permission O
to O
go O

     | O
forward O
and O
speak O
to O
his O
brother O
  O
and O
though O
not O
venturing O
quite O
to O
run O
, O
he O
moved O
onward O
at O
a O

     | O
pace O
that O
speedily O
brought O
him O
within O

of O
Edward B-PERSON

The O
little O
fellow O
who O
, O
despite O
his O
gay O
|
     | O
disguise O
, O
immediately O
recognised O
him O
, O
uttered O
a O
cry O
of O
joy O

" O

and O
dropping O

     | O
the O
reel O
he O
had O
just O
taken O
between O
his O

rushed O
from O

occupied O
before O

stood O
with O
gaping O

fixed O
upon O
the O

     | O
astounding O
spectacle O

Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
, O
too O
, O
forgot O
for O
an O
instant O
, O
that O
every O
movement O
made O
within O

that O

having O
for O
its O
object O
the O
transmutation O
of O

life O
into O

     | O
a O

was O
, O
he O
conceived O
, O
of O

high O
importance O

he O
looked O
round O
with O
great O
contentment O
on O
the O
multitude O
of O
wondering O
faces O

     | O

he O
saw O
peering O
over O

gaze O
on O

from O

now O
turned O
his O

fixed O

when O
, O

     | O
to O
his O
inconceivable O
astonishment O

by O

that O

uttering O

without O

of O
the O
young O

     | O
character O

long O
continued O

relief O

in O
the O

     | O
society O

could O
only O
amuse O

by O
their O
absurdities O

Almost O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
she O

     | O
exerted O
herself O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
pursuing O
some O
of O
her O
ordinary O
occupations O
, O
she O
drew O
forth O

     | O
her O
drawing O

box O
, O
and O
produced O
a O
caricature O

Lady O

reciting O
verses O
from O
the O
pen O
of O
Mr. O

     | O
Norval B-PERSON
  O
and O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
observations O
she O
committed O
to O
paper O
, O
were O
the O
result O
of O
a O
tolerably O

     | O
accurate O
counting O
of O
the O
number O
of O
times O
Mrs. O

had O
uttered O
" O

during O
her O
last O

     | O
visit O

express O
their O
sympathy O

her O
very O
soul O
sickened O
under O
the O
cuckoo O
- O
note O
of O

     | O
sorrowless O
lamentation O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
there O
was O
so O
much O
of O
real O
sadness O
in O
the O
spectacle O
of O
a O
|
     | O
young O
girl O
thus O
left O
utterly O
alone O
in O
the O
world O
, O
that O
despite O
the O
golden O
light O
her O
wealth O
threw O
|
     | O
around O
her O
, O
many O
among O
her O
herd O
of O
visiters O
might O
have O
felt O
more O
for O
her O
, O
perhaps O
, O
than O
she O
|
     | O
gave O
them O
credit O
for O

But O
, O
unfortunately O
such O
persons O
are O
not O
those O
who O
make O
their O
" O
griefs O
and O

     | O
clamour O
roar O
" O
most O
audibly O
, O
so O
she O
knew O
nothing O
about O
it O
, O
if O
it O
were O
so O
, O
and O
thereby O
lost O
any O

     | O
advantage O
which O
her O
temper O
might O
have O
gained O
from O
emotions O
that O
soothe O

soften O
. O
|  
  | O
Instead O
of O
this O
, O
she O
had O
to O
undergo O
what O
she O
felt O
to O
be O
a O
very O
severe O
persecution O
, O
from O
the O

     | O
prodigiously O

in O
this O

" O
Did O
you O

such O

my O
dear O

No O

never O

that O

quite O

     | O
certain O

It O
is O
quite O
out O

" O

  | O
Something O
a O
little O
approaching O
to O
a O
start O
, O
produced O
a O
slight O
movement O
in O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
. O

     | O
Mrs. O
Gabberly B-PERSON
proceeded O
. O

  | O
" O
Well O
now O
, O
my O
dear O
! O
I O
have O
been O
thinking O
that O
what O
you O
must O
do O
, O
is O
to O
find O
out O
among O
your O

     | O
friends O
and O
acquaintance O
, O
some O
respectable O
person O
in O
the O
situation O
of O
a O
gentlewoman O
to O
live O

     | O
with O
you O
. O
Somebody O
already O
known O
in O
the O
neighbourhood O
, O
would O
be O
the O
most O
desirable O
, O
because O

     | O
then O
you O
would O
not O
have O
the O
trouble O
of O
introducing O
her O
  O
for O
of O
course O
it O
will O
be O
in O
no O
wise O

     | O
proper O
for O
so O
young O
a O
person O
as O
you O
are O
to O
visit O
about O
, O
even O
in O
the O
country O

without O
a O
proper O

     | O
chaperone O

  | O
Again O
the O
cushions O
were O
slightly O
moved O
, O
but O
this O
time O
it O
was O
not O
a O
start O
, O
but O
a O
shudder O
which O
|
     | O
caused O
it O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Well O
now O
, O
my O
dear O
Mary B-PERSON
! O
" O
resumed O
the O
friendly O
Mrs. O
Gabberly B-PERSON
  O
" O
what O
do O
you O
think O
about O

     | O
it O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
It O
requires O
longer O

answer O
your O
question O

Gabberly O

replied O
the O
young O
lady O

" O

that O
's O
very O
true O

very O
discreet O

sensible O

God O
forbid O
, O
my O
dear O

that O
I O

     | O
should O
make O
you O
do O
any O
thing O
in O
a O
hurry O
. O
Only O
you O
must O
not O
forget O
that O
every O
body O
will O
be O
on O

     | O
the O
look O
out O
to O
observe O
what O
you O
do O

upon O
it O

that O
they O

their O
remarks O

that O

The O
heiress O
retained O
her O
meditative O
position O

said O
nothing O

  | O
Mary B-PERSON
bowed O
her O
head O

without O
changing O
the O
position O
of O
the O

concealed O
her O

     | O
face O

the O

looking O
earnestly O
at O

" O
what O
does O

that O

you O
must O
bear O
that O
, O

a O
great O
deal O
more O
, O
my O
dear O
old O
friend O

You O
must O
make O
up O
your O
mind O

lead O
a O
new O
life O
altogether O

I O
am O

not O

It O
will O

no O

you O

quite O
the O
contrary O

shall O
like O
it O
very O

     | O
much O

me O

too O
young O

your O

busy O

such O

the O
misfortune O

not O

pester O
me O

her O
presence O

morning B-TIME

a O

penance O
that O
I O
can O
not O

will O
not O

Yet O
I O
know O

devoted O
servant O

absolutely O
confounded O

" O
| 
  | O
From O
the O
moment O
the O
old O
woman O
had O
perceived O
that O
her O
beloved O
, O
but O
wilful O
darling O
, O
was O
not O
|
     | O
only O
serious O
, O
but O
sorrowful O
, O
and O
that O
, O
too O
, O
concerning O
no O
imaginary O
grief O
, O
but O
from O
the O
|
     | O
contemplation O
of O
the O
truly O
melancholy O
isolation O
of O
her O
condition O
, O
all O
disposition O
to O
resist O
her O
|
     | O
vanished O
  O
and O
yet O
nurse O
Tremlett B-PERSON
was O
perfectly O
capable O
of O
perceiving O
all O
the O
inconveniences O
|
     | O
likely O
to O
arise O
on O
both O
sides O
from O
so O
strange O
a O
scheme O
. O
But O
even O
while O
such O
thoughts O
silently O
|
     | O
took O
possession O
of O
her O
, O
leaving O
perhaps O
some O
legible O
traces O
on O
her O
countenance O
, O
her O
young O
|
     | O
mistress O
looked O
so O
kindly O
and O
so O
coaxingly O
in O
her O
face O
, O
as O
if O
at O
once O
reading O
and O
deprecating O
|
     | O
all O
she O
had O
to O
say O
, O
that O
she O
felt O
nothing O
was O
left O
for O
her O
but O
obedience O
. O
| 
   | O
smile O
and O
a O
shake O
of O
the O
head O
, O
that O
seemed O
to O
say O
, O
" O
I O
know O
you O
must O
have O
your O
own O

     | O
way O

" O

  | O
And O
thus O
was O
conceived O
and O
established O
a O
mode O
of O
life O
for O
the O
pretty O
heiress O
, O
which O
left O
her O

     | O
as O
completely O
uncontrolled O

to O
all O

said O

new O
duties O
, O
was O
childish O
and O
|
     | O
excessive O
  O
and O
most O
triumphant O
was O
the O
satisfaction O
with O
which O
she O
perceived O
that O
rich O
black O

     | O
silks O
, O
and O
delicate O
white O
crape O
, O
performed O
their O
office O
upon O
her O
nice O
little O

     | O
effectually O

on O

following O
Saturday B-DATE

Mrs. O

on O

sat O
the O

looking O
a O
vast O
deal O

     | O
more O
happy O
than O
she O
had O
ever O

The O
mystification O
did O
not O
last O

The O
eyes O
of O
Mrs. O
Gabberly B-PERSON
were O
of O
that O
happy O
fabric O
, O

     | O
which O
enables O
the O

to O
retain O
for O

the O
memory O
of O
every O
face O
they O
have O
ever O
looked O
upon O
  O

     | O
and O
it O
was O
with O
heightened O
colour O
, O
and O
no O
very O
sweet O
expression O
of O
countenance O
, O
that O
she O

     | O
exclaimed O
, O
" O
Soh B-PERSON
! O
you O
have O
taken O
your O
old O
nurse O

Tremlett B-PERSON

sit O
with O
you O

My O

my O
most O
kind O
friend O

Mrs. O
Gabberly B-PERSON
, O
who O
has O
affectionately O
consented O

     | O
to O
forsake O
many O
of O
her O
former O
comforts O

in O
order O
to O
be O
useful O
to O
me O

You O
will O
perceive O
, O
ma'am O
, O
|
     | O
that O
your O
advice O
has O
not O
been O
lost O
upon O
me O

" O

  | O
" O
Well O
now O
! O
that O
is O
a O
strange O
whim O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
. O
But O
of O
course O
, O
you O
are O
not O
serious O
in O
|
     | O
trying O
to O
make O
me O
believe O
that O
it O
is O
your O
intention O
to O
let O
nurse O
Tremlett B-PERSON
assist O
you O
in O

     | O
receiving O
your O
company O

If O
it O
be O
so O
, O
I O
think O
it O
but O
fair O
to O
tell O
you O
at O
once O
, O
as O
my O
experience O
|
     | O
is O
rather O
greater O
than O
yours O
, O
that O
not O
one B-CARDINAL
single O
soul O
among O
all O
our O
rich O
folks O
, O
will O
care O

you O
at O
all O

I O
do O
n't O
wish O
to O
affront O
you O
, O
nurse O
Tremlett B-PERSON
  O
but O
you O
wo O
n't O
contradict O
what O
I O

     | O
say O
, O
I O
am O
quite O
sure O
of O
that O

" O

  | O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
showed O
herself O
an O
apt O
scholar O
, O
for O
she O
bowed O
her O
head O
, O
went O
on O
with O
her O

     | O
knitting O
, O
and O
said O
nothing O

| 
   | O
If O
any O
one O
now O
in O
existence O
really O
loves O
me O

it O
is O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
  O
and O
I O
, O
too O
, O
most O

     | O
sincerely O
love O
her O
  O
therefore O
I O
flatter O
myself O
, O
that O
drawing O
tighter O
the O
tie O
that O
has O
long O

     | O
united O
us O
, O
will O
occasion O
pain O
to O
neither O

If O
the O
obscure O
tradition O
I O
have O
heard O
respecting O
my O

     | O
grandfather O
be O
correct O

he O
received O
much O
kindness O
when O
travelling O
the O
country O
as O
an O
itinerant O

     | O
tinker O
from O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON

father O
, O
then O
a O
flourishing O
farmer O
in O
Yorkshire B-GPE

So O
you O
perceive O
, O
|
     | O
Mrs. O
Gabberly B-PERSON
, O
that O
I O
am O
really O
honoured O
by O
the O
association O

But O
if O
any O
one O
should O
fancy O
the O

     | O
contrary O
— O
if O
any O
one O
should O
feel O
that O
the O
luxuries O
of O
my O
house O

the O
only O

by O
which O
I O
may O
hope O
to O
draw O
my O

if O
any O
should O
feel O

     | O
that O
the O
value O
of O
these O
are O
lessened O
by O
the O
presence O
of O
Mrs. O

they O
must O
give O
them O
up O

     | O
For O
the O
price O
I O
shall O
put O
upon O
my O
good O

And O
now O
that O
we O
have O
finally O

for O

you O

" O

From O
this O
period O
, O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
never O
quitted O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton I-PERSON
, O
excepting O
when O
the O
heiress O

     | O
accommodated O
Lady O
Clarissa B-PERSON
Shrimpton I-PERSON
by O
the O
use O
of O
her O
carriage O
, O
when O
they O
were O
both O
going O
to O
|
     | O
visit O
at O
the O
same O
mansion O
: O
an O
arrangement O
which O
had O
often O
taken O
place O
during O
the O
late O
Mrs. O

     | O
Brotherton B-PERSON
's O
lifetime O
, O
and O
which O
was O
of O
such O
very O
obvious O
mutual O
convenience O
, O
that O
one O
was O

     | O
rarely O
invited O
without O
the O
other O

| 
  | O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
by O
degrees O
recovered O
her O
natural O
high O
spirits O
, O
and O
though O
she O
not O
|
     | O
unfrequently O
felt O
the O
weight O
of O
great O
loneliness O
, O
she O
was O
rapidly O
learning O
to O
enjoy O
her O
|
     | O
independence O
. O
She O
read O
a O
great O
deal O
, O
though O
nobody O
knew O
any O
thing O
about O
it O
. O
She O
dearly O
loved O

     | O
flowers O
, O
and O
often O
assisted O
in O
their O
culture O
with O
her O
own O
hands O
, O
despite O
her O
half B-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
dozen I-CARDINAL

     | O
gardeners O
. O
She O
laid O
out O
whole O
miles O
of O
gravel O
walks O
in O
her O
own O
grounds O
with O
almost O
as O
much O

     | O
skill O
as O
went O
to O
form O
the O
Cretan B-NORP
labyrinth O
, O
in O
order O
that O
she O
might O
walk O

walk O
, O

     | O
without O
passing O
her O
own O

and O
so O
running O
the O
risk O
of O
being O
called O
" O

        | O
imprudent O

" O
She O
still O
indulged O
herself O
, O
and O
with O
no O
sparing O
licence O
, O
in O
caricaturing O

     | O
her O
neighbours O
  O
and O
, O
if O
all O
the O
truth O
must O
be O
told O

derived O
no O
small O
portion O
of O
amusement O
from O

     | O
the O
variety O

adopted O
to O
assure O
the O
almost O
innumerable O
pretenders O

her O
hand O

that O

it O
was O
not O
in O
her O
power O
to O
reward O
their O
valuable O
and O
flattering O
attachments O

was O
Mary B-PERSON

condition O
when O
she O
complied O
with O

     | O
request O
, O
to O
drive O
over O
to O
Dowling B-PERSON
Lodge I-PERSON
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
after O
they O
had O
dined O
there O

Upon O
this O
occasion O
, O
|
     | O
as O
upon O
many O
previous O
ones O
, O
the O
young O
lady O
, O
for O
lack O
of O
other O
amusement O
, O
occupied O
herself O
in O

     | O
selecting O
subjects O
for O
her O
merry O
pencil O

The O
best O
excuse O
to O
be O
offered O
for O
her O
offences O
in O
this O
|
     | O
line O
is O
, O
that O
nobody O
but O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
ever O
saw O
her O
saucy O
productions O
  O
so O
that O
assuredly O
they O
|
     | O
gave O
pain O
to O
no O
one O
— O
and O
when O
the O
heart O
is O
empty O
, O
and O
the O
head O
full O
, O
much O
allowance O
must O
be O

     | O
made O
for O
such O
freaks O

fancies O
. O
| 
   | O
and O
the O
poet O
, O
her O
eye O
suddenly O
became O
fixed O
upon O
the O
beautiful O
child O
who O
had O
been O

     | O
brought O
in O
for O
general O
examination O

Like O
most O
other O
ready O
limners O
of O
the O
human O
face O
, O
Miss B-PERSON
|
     | I-PERSON
Brotherton I-PERSON
had O
considerable O
skill O
in O
physiognomy O
, O
and O
ere O
she O
had O
long O
gazed O
on O
the O
pretty O
, O
|
     | O
nicely O
- O
dressed O
, O
little O
boy O

felt O

in O
spite O
of O
his O
gay O

habit O
de O
fête O

     | O
, O
the O
child O
was O
ill O
at O
ease O
, O
and O
under O
great O
discomfort O
. O

It O
is O
difficult O
for O
persons O
residing O
at O
a O
distance O
, O
and O

not O
|  | O
" O
to O
the O
manner O
born O

" O
to O
|
     | O
conceive O
the O
extraordinary O
degree O
of O
ignorance O
in O
which O
the O
ladies O
of O
the O
great O
manufacturing O

are O
brought O
up O

their O
wealth O
is O
derived O

| 
  | O
There O
is O
, O
however O
, O
a O
homely O
proverb O
that O
may O
help O
to O
explain O
this O
: O
" O
You O
should O
never O
speak O
of O

     | O
a O
rope O
in O
the O
house O
of O
a O
man O
that O
was O
hanged O
, O
" O
and O
it O
is O
probably O
on O
the O
same O
principle O
, O
that O
|
     | O
no O
one O
speaks O
of O
the O
factory O
in O
the O
house O
of O
the O
manufacturer O
. O
Be O
this O
as O
it O
may O
, O
the O
fact O
is O
|
     | O
certain O
, O
and O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton I-PERSON
, O
like O
perhaps O
a O
hundred B-CARDINAL
other O
rich O
young O
ladies O
, O
of O
the O
same O
|
     | O
class O
, O
grew O
up O
in O
total O
ignorance O
of O
the O
moans O

the O
misery O
that O
lurked O
beneath O
the O
unsightly O

which O
were O
much O

ugly O

of O

that O
her O
own O
sharp O

     | O
observation O
had O
enabled O
her O
to O
perceive O
that O

most O

After O

evident O
to O

that O
he O
was O
very O
keenly O
watching O
the O
boy O

and O
more O
than O
once O

     | O
she O
detected O
a O
look O
from O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON

directed O
towards O
him O
, O
which O
was O
instantly O
followed O
by O
an O

     | O
attempt O
on O
the O
child O

part O
to O
look O
less O
miserable O

Then O
followed O
all O
the O
nonsense O
about O
Mr. O
Osmond B-PERSON
Norval I-PERSON

and O
his O
promised O
drama O

was O
to O

     | O
place O

the O
scene O

prodigiously O
generous O
action O

not O

sick O
of O
the O
false O

fulsome O

     | O
flattery O
that O
was O
bandied O
about O
between O

seen O
, O
a O
somewhat O
hasty O
retreat O

   | O
some O
time O
she O
suffered O
her O
ridiculous O

to O
run O
on O
in O
a O
violent O
strain O
of O

     | O
panegyric O
upon O
Sir O

his O
generosity O
, O
without O
offering O
any O

     | O
but O
at O
length O
it O
struck O
her O

that O
fool O

some O
tirade O
about O

benevolently O
taken O
out O

my O

there O

many O
will O
tell O
you O
that O
it O
is O
the O
finest O
thing O

the O
world O
for O
the O
places O
where O
the O

so B-CARDINAL
many I-CARDINAL
thousands I-CARDINAL
of O

for O
the O

of O
the O

     | O
Bridge O

water O
family O

She O
had O

moreover O
, O
the O
gratification O
of O
discovering O

what O
order O
Sir O

     | O
Matthew B-PERSON
, O
Lady O
Clarissa B-PERSON
, O
the O
poet O
, O
the O
governess O
, O
most O
of O
the O
young O
Dowlings B-PERSON
, O
and O
little O
Michael B-PERSON
|
     | O
himself O
were O
to O
appear O
upon O
the O
scene O
, O
and O
then O
she O
returned O
the O
young O
gentleman O
's O
MS O
. O
with O
a O
|
     | O
very O
honest O
assurance O
that O
she O
doubted O
not O
the O
composition O
would O
most O
satisfactorily O
answer O
|
     | O
every O
purpose O
for O
which O
it O
was O
intended O
. O
| 
  | O
Absurd O
as O
the O
whole O
business O
appeared O
to O
her O
, O
she O
resolved O
to O
be O
present O
at O
the O
|
     | O
representation O
  O
and O
having O
perceived O
, O
in O
her O
study O
of O
the O
exists O
and O
entrances O
, O
that O
no O
part O
|
     | O
was O
allotted O
to O
the O
homely O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
she O
determined O
to O
place O
herself O
near O
her O
during O
the O
|
     | O
performance O
, O
in O
the O
hope O
of O
eliciting O
the O
information O
she O
was O
so O
anxious O
to O
obtain O
. O
| 
  | O
On O
many O
occasions O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
had O
remarked O
that O
this O
young O
lady O
either O
kept O
herself O
, O
or O
|
     | O
was O
kept O
very O
much O
apart O
from O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
family O
, O
which O
circumstance O
had O
been O
quite O
|
     | O
sufficient O
to O
propitiate O
her O
kindness O
, O
for O
most O
cordially O
did O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton I-PERSON
dislike O
the O
whole O
|
     | O
Dowling B-PERSON
race O
. O
But O
so O
deep O
- O
seated O
was O
the O
feeling O
of O
poor O
Martha B-PERSON
herself O
that O
nobody O
did O
, O
or O
|
     | O
could O
wish O
, O
to O
converse O
with O
her O
, O
that O
the O
hand O
- O
shakings O
and O
smiles O
of O
the O
heiress O
had O
never O
|
     | O
suggested O
to O
her O
the O
idea O
that O
she O
might O
wish O
to O
be O
better O
acquainted O
. O
This O
shyness O
had O
|
     | O
hitherto O
effectually O
kept O
them O
apart O
  O
but O
no O
sooner O
did O
Mary B-PERSON
perceive O
that O
the O
neglected O
girl O
|
     | O
was O
the O
only O
one O
of O
the O
family O
, O
above O
the O
age O
of O
a O
mere O
baby O
, O
to O
whom O
no O
part O
in O
Mr. O
Norval B-PERSON
's O
|
     | O
drama O
was O
allotted O
, O
than O
she O
resolved O
to O
profit O
by O
the O
circumstance O
, O
and O
, O
if O
possible O
, O
get O
from O
|
     | O
her O
such O
a O
commentary O
upon O
the O
piece O
, O
as O
might O
enable O
her O
to O
comprehend O
its O
plot O
and O
|
     | O
underplot O
. O
| 
  | O
Accordingly O
, O
when O
the O
great O
night O
of O
representation O
arrived O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
reached O
the O
|
     | O
Lodge B-PERSON
somewhat O
before O
the B-TIME
hour I-TIME
named O
in O
the O
invitation O
, O
and O
finding O
, O
as O
she O
expected O
, O
the O
room O
|
     | O
where O
the O
company O
were O
to O
be O
received O
, O
unoccupied O
, O
she O
desired O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
liveried O
attendants O
|
     | O
to O
send O
Miss O
Martha B-PERSON
Dowling I-PERSON
's O
maid O
to O
her O
. O
A O
female O
servant O
soon O
appeared O
. O
" O
Are O
you O
Miss O

     | O
Martha B-PERSON
's O
maid O
? O
" O
said O
the O
young O
lady O
. O

" O

and O
Miss O
Harriet B-PERSON

Miss O

never O
wants O
a O

     | O
lady O
's O
maid O
at O
all O
  O
but O
I O
can O
take O
any O

ma'am O

that O
you O
may O
please O
to O
|
     | O
send O

" O
| 
  | O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
took O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
her O
own O
cards O
, O
and O
wrote O
upon O
it O
with O
a O
pencil O
— O
" O

This O
note O
the O

soubrette O

, O
as O
in O
duty O
bound O
, O
first B-ORDINAL
showed O
to O
her O
own O
young O

     | O

. O
| 
  | O
" O
Good O

How O
very O

! O
What O

" O
Oh O

ma'am O
— O
at O
least O
she O
do O

look O
so O
. O
She O
seemed O
in O
a O
great O
hurry O
, O
however O
, O
for O
|
     | O
me O
to O
take O
the O
card O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Well O
, O
take O
it O
then O
, O
" O
cried O
Miss B-PERSON
Harriet I-PERSON
, O
impatiently O
, O
" O

make O
haste O

I O

Do O

What O

is O
there O
in O

     | O
spelling O
it O
over O
a O
dozen B-CARDINAL
times O
? O
I O
dare O
say O
she O
only O
wants O
to O
cross O
- O
question O
her O
about O
Augustus B-PERSON
, O

     | O
and O
what O
he O
's O
going O
to O
act O

So O
take O
the O
card O
, O
Crompton B-PERSON
, O
and O
run O
with O
it O
to O
Martha B-PERSON
as O
fast O
as O

     | O
you O
can O
. O
" O
| 
   | O
certain O
than O
usual O
that O
her O
presence O
would O
not O
be O
wanted O
, O
had O
made O
up O
her O
mind O
to O

     | O
enjoy O
herself O
till O
the O
time O
arrived O
for O
the O
commencement O
of O
the O
play O
, O
when O
it O
was O
her O
purpose O

to O
join O
the O
large O
party O

progress O

room O

the O
theatre O

  | O
On O
receiving O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
's O
card O
, O
however O
, O
she O
hastily O
resumed O
the O
business O
of O
her O
toilet O
  O
|
     | O
for O
though O
the O
summons O
was O
as O
unintelligible O
to O
her O
as O
to O
her O
sisters O
, O
she O
felt O
, O
at O
least O
, O
an O
|
     | O
equal O
desire O
that O
it O
should O
be O
civilly O
complied O
with O
. O
It O
never O
took O
long O
to O
make O
poor O
Martha B-PERSON
as O
|
     | O
smart O
as O
she O
ever O
thought O
it O
necessary O
to O
be O
, O
and O
in O
a B-TIME
very I-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
she O
joined O
Miss B-PERSON
|
     | I-PERSON
Brotherton I-PERSON
in O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
This O
is O
very O
kind O
of O
you O
, O
Miss O
Martha B-PERSON
. O
I O
hope O
I O
have O
not O
hurried O
you O
? O
" O
said O
the O
heiress O
, O
|
     | O
taking O
her O
hand O
so O
kindly O
, O
that O
the O
shy O
girl O
could O
not O
but O
feel O
encouraged O
to O
speak O
to O
her O
with O
|
     | O
rather O
more O
confidence O
than O
usual O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Why O
are O
you O
not O
going O
to O
take O
a O
part O
? O
" O
was O
the O
next O
question O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
take O
a O
part O
! O
Oh O
! O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
what O
should O
I O
make O
of O
acting O
? O
" O
said O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
laughing O
and O
|
     | O
blushing O
, O
in O
reply O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Nay O
I O
think O
you O
are O
very O
right O
, O
Martha B-PERSON
. O
I O
assure O
you O
nothing O
could O
have O
persuaded O
me O
to O
have O
|
     | O
made O
the O
attempt O
. O
But O
I O
thought O
that O
if O
you O
did O
not O
play O
, O
you O
would O
perhaps O
have O
the O
kindness O
|
     | O
to O
take O
charge O
of O
me O
, O
and O
let O
me O
sit O
by O
you O
  O
for O
unless O
I O
have O
somebody O
to O
tell O
me O
what O
it O
all O
|
     | O
means O
I O
shall O
be O
horribly O
puzzled O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
will O
tell O
you O
every O
thing O
I O
can O
, O
" O
replied O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
good O
- O
humouredly O
. O
" O
But O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
I O
|
     | O
understand O
much O
about O
it O
myself O

" O

" O
What O
sort O
of O
a O
little O
boy O

it O

your O
papa O

so O
kind O

is O
talking O

about O
it O

Lady O
Clarissa B-PERSON
says O
there O
is O
something O
quite O
sublime O
in O
what O
he O
is O
going O
to O
do O
for O
|
     | O
him O
. O
But O
I O
suppose O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
must O
have O
remarked O
some O
qualities O
particularly O
amiable O
and O
good O

     | O
in O
the O
child O

would O
not O
distinguish O
him O

remarkably O
from O
all O
others O
of O

     | O
class O

You O

heard O
the O
story O
of O

I O

" O

" O
But O
it O
seems O
that O
they O
all O
live O
together O
, O
and O
make O
one O
another O
worse O
  O
and O
, O
in O
that O
case O
, O
the O

     | O
children O
are O
very O
much O
to O
be O
pitied O
  O
for O
, O
poor O
little O
things O
, O
they O
can O
not O
help O
themselves O

What O
|
     | O
makes O
you O
think O
this O
little O
boy O
is O
a O
nice O
child O
? O
Have O
you O
ever O
talked O
to O
him O
much O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Yes O
, O
a O
good O
deal O
  O
but O
papa O
has O
been O
taking O
him O
about O
to O
a O
great O
many O
houses O
  O
and O
besides O
, O
he O
|
     | O
has O
been O
occupied O
very O
much O
in O
learning O
his O
part O
, O
for O
Duo B-ORG
, O
who O
was O
teaching O
him O
, O
said O
that O
he O
|
     | O
could O
hardly O
read O
at O
all O
. O
So O
I O
have O
been O
trying O
to O
help O
him O
, O
and O
he O
is O
very O
quick O
. O
But O
I O
like O
|
     | O
him O
, O
too O
, O
because O
he O
appears O
so O
fond O
of O
his O
mother O
and O
brother O
. O
He O
cares O
for O
nothing O
that O
can O
|
     | O
be O
given O
him O
, O
unless O
he O
can O
take O
some O
of O
it O
to O
them O
. O
" O

  | O
" O
And O
does O
your O
papa O
let O
him O
do O
so O
? O
" O

" O
Oh O
! O
yes O
, O
every O
day O

" O
| 
  | O
" O
That O

is O

very O
kind O

Then O
I O
suppose O
the O
little O
fellow O

superlatively O
happy O

" O
I O

replied O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
slight O
shake O
of O
the O
head O
. O

  | O
" O
It O
is O
very O
strange O
if O
he O

not O
, O
" O
observed O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
. O
" O
If O
he O
were O
kept O
from O
his O
mother O

     | O
I O
could O
easily O
understand O
that O
he O
might O
be O
very O
miserable O
, O
notwithstanding O
the O
great O
good O
luck O

     | O
that O
has O
befallen O
him O
  O
but O
if O
he O
is O
permitted O
to O
see O
her O
constantly O
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
imagine O
what O

" O

again O

The O
expected O

now O
rapidly O

themselves O
, O
after O
some O
little O
confusion O
, O
into O
a O
|
        | O
tableau O
|  | O
, O
declared O
, O
on O
all O
sides O
, O
to O
be O
of O
unrivalled O
beauty O
. O
Again O
bravoes O
and O
|
     | O
clapping O
of O
hands O
announced O
the O
delight O
of O
the O
spectators O
  O
and O
, O
when O
this O
was O
calmed O
, O
some O
very O
|
     | O
pompous O
verses O
gave O
notice O
that O
this O
display O
of O
youthful O
grace O
and O
beauty O
, O
was O
on O
occasion O
of O
a O
|
     | O
rustic O
fête O
, O
in O
which O
the O
|  | O
dramatis O
personæ O
|  | O
were O
to O
amuse O
themselves O
|  | O
al O
fresco O
| 
     | O
. O
Then O
entered O
the O
Lady O
Clarissa B-PERSON
  O
but O
, O
for O
some O
good O
reason O
or O
other O
, O
it O
had O
been O
decided O
, O
|
     | O
between O
the O
knight O
and O
herself O
, O
that O
she O
should O
enter O
alone O
: O
and O
from O
a O
most O
poetical O
scream O
of O
|
     | O
terror O
, O
soon O
uttered O
by O
her O
ladyship O
, O
it O
became O
evident O
that O
a O
dragon O
, O
or O
a O
cow O
, O
or O
some O
other O
|
     | O
dreadful O
animal O
had O
been O
pursuing O
her O
. O
Again O
and O
again O
, O
with O
most O
picturesque O
effect O
, O
she O
|
     | O
looked O
behind O
her O
towards O
the O
blue O
silk O
|  | O
coulisses O
|  | O
, O
from O
whence O
she O
had O
issued O
, O
till O
, O
|
     | O
at O
length O
, O
the O
feelings O
of O
the O
audience O
were O
worked O
up O
to O
a O
wonderful O
pitch O
, O
by O
her O
ejaculating O
|
     | O
— O
" O
It O
comes O
! O
It O
comes O
! O
" O
|  
   | O
high O
, O
and O
dressed O
, O
in O
all O
respects O
, O
precisely O
as O
he O
had O
been O
on O
the O
memorable O
|
     | O
night O
of O
Lady O
Clarissa B-PERSON
's O
vaccine O
adventure O
. O
|  
  | O
In O
dumb O
show O
the O
lady O
indicated O
the O
direction O
from O
whence O
the O
dreaded O
monster O
would O
approach O
  O
|
     | O
and O
the O
most O
energetic O
and O
unsparing O
action O
of O
the O
limbs O
and O
person O
secured O
the O
audience O
, O
as O
|
     | O
well O
as O
her O
deliverer O
, O
from O
any O
possible O
mistake O
on O
the O
subject O
. O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
too O
, O
performed O
his O
|
     | O
part O
with O
great O
spirit O
, O
exaggerating O
, O
as O
he O
had O
been O
commanded O
, O
by O
every O
possible O
means O
, O
the O
|
     | O
manævres O
necessary O
for O
turning O
the O
front O
of O
a O
cow O
. O
| 
  | O
To O
this O
scene O
, O
too O
, O
the O
audience O
gave O
loud O
applause O
, O
and O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
it O
entered O
Sir O
|
     | O
Matthew B-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
, O
of O
course O
, O
greeted O
by O
bravoes O
, O
" O
long O
drawn O
out O
, O
" O
till O
the O
ladies O
and O
|
     | O
gentlemen O
having O
nearly O
deafened O
one B-CARDINAL
another O
, O
ceased O
at O
last O
, O
and O
listened O
to O
the O
beautiful O
|
     | O
explanation O
which O
followed O
. O
| 
  | O
First B-ORDINAL
the O
company O
were O
made O
to O
comprehend O
that O
the O
danger O
was O
over O
, O
for O
the O
well O
- O
taught O
|
     | O
Michael B-PERSON
turned O
about O
, O
and O
manfully O
facing O
the O
audience O
, O
pronounced O
distinctly O
" O
The O
beast O
is O
|
     | O
gone O
! O
" O
Then O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
, O
after O
bowing O
respectfully O
to O
the O
lady O
, O
said O
, O
" O
Permit O
me O
, O
madam O
, O
to O
|
     | O
express O
my O
joy O
, O
That O
you O
've O
been O
saved O
by O
this O
good O
little O
boy O
. O
" O
It O
was O
, O
however O
, O
uttered O
in O
an O
|
     | O
accent O
of O
such O
temperate O
and O
measured O
feeling O
, O
that O
not O
even O
Lady B-PERSON
Dowling I-PERSON
saw O
any O
thing O
very O
|
     | O
particular O
in O
it O
. O
A O
precaution O
by O
the O
way O
, O
which O
had O
been O
suggested O
by O
the O
gentlemen O
during O
the O
|
     | O
frequent O
rehearsals O
. O
| 
  | O
Lady O
Clarissa B-PERSON
's O
acting O
then O
became O
animated O
indeed O
  O
for O
the O
poet O
, O
following O
her O
instructions O
, O
|
     | O
had O
composed O
for O
her O
in O
smooth O
, O
yet O
startling O
rhymes O
, O
about B-CARDINAL
thirty I-CARDINAL
lines O
of O
the O
most O
fervent O
|
     | O
thanksgiving O
, O
in O
which O
, O
now O
laying O
one B-CARDINAL
hand O
on O
the O
head O
of O
the O
ragged O
child O
, O
now O
clasping O
both O
|
     | O
together O
in O
the O
eagerness O
of O
her O
address O
to O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
, O
and O
now O
gracefully O
extending O
both O
arms O
|
     | O
towards O
the O
audience O
, O
as O
if O
to O
make O
them O
sharers O
in O
her O
generous O
emotions O
, O
she O
produced O
an O
|
     | O
effect O
more O
easily O
imagined O
than O
described O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
speech O
which O
followed O
from O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
was O
very O
noble O
, O
and O
at O
once O
let O
the O
audience O
into O
|
     | O
all O
the O
secret O
purposes O
of O
his O
benevolent O
heart O
. O
The O
by O
- O
play O
of O
Michael B-PERSON
during O
this O
scene O
had O
|
     | O
been O
prepared O
for O
by O
his O
benefactor O
with O
particular O
care O
, O
but O
somehow O
or O
other O
the O
boy O
was O
not O
|
     | O
apt O
in O
catching O
the O
knight O
's O
idea O
  O
for O
instead O
of O
the O
tender O
but O
joyous O
smile O
with O
which O
he O
had O
|
     | O
been O
instructed O
to O
look O
up O
into O
the O
face O
of O
his O
munificent O
patron O
, O
his O
countenance O
expressed O
|
     | O
nothing O
but O
terror O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
That O
little O
fellow O
does O
not O
look O
happy O
, O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
" O
whispered O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Oh O
no O
! O
he O
looks O
very O
frightened O
, O
" O
replied O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
" O
but O
that O
is O
very O
natural O
, O
is O
it O
not O
, O
|
     | O
considering O
the O
novelty O
of O
his O
situation O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
" O
said O
the O
heiress O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
piece O
went O
on O
to O
exhibit O
the O
beautiful O
manner O
in O
which O
this O
adoption O
of O
a O
ragged O
|
     | O
factory O
- O
boy O
into O
the O
bosom O
of O
the O
Dowling B-PERSON
family O
had O
been O
hailed O
by O
all O
of O
them O
as O
an O
especial O
|
     | O
grace O
from O
heaven O
, O
on O
account O
of O
the O
opportunity O
it O
afforded O
for O
relieving O
the O
overflowing O
|
     | O
generosity O
of O
their O
hearts O
. O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
, O
while O
looking O
round O
upon O
his O
sixteen B-CARDINAL
full O
- O
dressed O
|
     | O
offspring O
, O
who O
were O
now O
again O
skilfully O
grouped O
upon O
the O
stage O
, O
was O
made O
to O
exclaim O
with O
|
     | O
clasped O
hands O
, O
and O
an O
almost O
sobbing O
excess O
of O
emotion O
, O
" O
The O
widow O
and O
the O
orphan O
are O
more O
|
     | O
dear O
, O
To O
their O
young O
hearts O
, O
than O
million O
pounds O
a O
year O
! O
" O
|  
  | O
Every O
body O
was O
touched O
, O
and O
again O
the O
applause O
was O
deafening O
. O
| 
  | O
Then O
came O
a O
very O
striking O
scene O
indeed O
. O
Michael B-PERSON
appeared O
superbly O
dressed O
, O
and O
on O
each O
side O
|
     | O
of O
him O
was O
a O
middling O
- O
sized O
Miss O
Dowling B-PERSON
, O
holding O
lightly O
and O
gracefully O
each O
a O
little O
basket O
, O
|
     | O
from O
under O
the O
covers O
of O
which O
peeped O
out O
grapes O
and O
peaches O
on O
the O
one O
side O
, O
and O
something O
|
     | O
that O
had O
the O
semblance O
of O
a O
flask O
of O
wine O
on O
the O
other O
. O
| 
  | O
Then O
spoke O
the O
fair O
- O
haired O
Louisa B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Dear O
little O
boy O
, O
this O
basket O
's O
all O
your O
own O
, O
|  
  | O
' O
Tis O
to O
reward O
the O
courage O
you O
have O
shown O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
And O
then O
Miss O
Charlotte B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
" O
So O
is O
this O
too O
, O
my O
pretty O
little O
boy O
, O
|  
  | O
We O
hope O
' O
twill O
give O
your O
poor O
old O
mother O
joy O
. O
" O
|  
  | O
And O
when O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
having O
received O
a O
basket O
in O
each O
hand O
, O
appeared O
preparing O
to O
depart O
, O
the O
|
     | O
two B-CARDINAL
young O
ladies O
exclaimed O
together O
, O
" O
' O
Tis O
papa O
sends O
it O
, O
who O
's O
so O
very O
kind O
, O
How O
to O
do O
good O
, O
|
     | O
is O
all O
he O
seeks O
to O
find O
! O
" O
|  
  | O
Upon O
this O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
turned O
round O
again O
towards O
the O
audience O
, O
and O
stood O
stock O
still O
. O
It O
was O
|
     | O
quite O
evident O
that O
he O
had O
some O
speech O
to O
make O
which O
he O
had O
apparently O
forgotten O
, O
for O
it O
was O
|
     | O
impossible O
for O
any O
child O
to O
look O
more O
completely O
distressed O
and O
at O
a O
loss O
. O
| 
  | O
At O
length O
it O
became O
pretty O
evident O
that O
, O
in O
lieu O
of O
all O
other O
performance O
, O
the O
poor O
boy O
was O
|
     | O
going O
to O
cry O
  O
and O
some O
ingenious O
persons O
doubted O
whether O
it O
might O
not O
be O
in O
his O
part O
to O
do O
so O
  O
|
     | O
but O
this O
idea O
was O
speedily O
removed O
by O
the O
very O
matter O
- O
of O
- O
fact O
pokes O
and O
nudges O
which O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
|
     | O
young O
ladies O
bestowed O
upon O
him O
. O
In O
addition O
to O
this O
it O
seemed O
as O
if O
the O
little O
fellow O
caught O
|
     | O
some O
stimulating O
sounds O
from O
the O
|  | O
coulisses O
|  | O
, O
for O
he O
cast O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
furtive O
glance O
|
     | O
in O
that O
direction O
, O
and O
at O
length O
, O
with O
what O
was O
evidently O
a O
great O
effort O
, O
he O
stammered O
out O
, O
" O
My O
|
     | O
mother O
's O
dear O
, O
and O
so O
's O
my O
brother O
too O
, O
But O
dearer O
still O
are O
your O
papa O
and O
you O
. O
His O
charity O
's O
|
     | O
so O
great O
, O
his O
heart O
so O
good O
, O
He O
gives O
the O
naked O
clothes O
  O
the O
hungry O
food O
  O
And O
I O
for O
— O
one O

in O
prayer O

him O
— O
and O
— O
his O
— O
worth O
declare O
. O
" O
|  
  | O
The O
two B-CARDINAL
last O
lines O
were O
so O
completely O
choked O
by O
the O
tears O
, O
which O
all O
his O
efforts O
could O
not O
|
     | O
suffice O
to O
restrain O
, O
that O
they O
were O
perfectly O
unintelligible O
to O
the O
audience O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Is O
all O
that O
vehemence O
of O
weeping O
a O
part O
of O
Mr. O
Norval B-PERSON
's O
composition O
? O
" O
inquired O
Miss B-PERSON
|
     | O
Brotherton B-PERSON
in O
a O
whisper O
to O
Martha B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Upon O
my O
word O
I O
do O
n't O
know O

I O
should O

was O
the O
reply O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Martha B-PERSON
! O
" O
said O
the O
heiress O
, O
very O
earnestly O
, O
" O

" O
I O
should O

said O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
voice O

my O

" O

" O
I O
think O

" O
replied O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
" O
that O
one O
can O
hardly O
doubt O
his O
being O
better O
off O

in O
the O

     | O
poverty O
of O

You O
saw O

Miss O

, O
what O
a O
ragged O
condition O
the O
clothes O

" O
Decent O

are O
a O
comfort O
, O
my O
dear O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
there O
can O
be O
no O
doubt O
of O
it O
  O
but O
compared O
with O

     | O
the O
other O
circumstances O
which O
influence O
the O
happiness O
of O
life O
, O
they O
are O
of O
no O
great O
importance O
. O
|
     | O
Of O
course O
I O
suppose O
that O
your O
father O
means O
to O
educate O
him O
. O
Do O
you O
know O
whether O
he O
can O

" O
I O

Martha B-PERSON
, O
smiling O
, O
" O
she O
is O
a O
very O
estimable O
person O
indeed O
  O
but O

     | O
it O
certainly O
seems O
that O
she O
has O
not O
taken O
much O
pains O
with O
his O
education O
, O
poor O
little O

fellow O

" O

  | O
" O
What O
a O
sad O
thing O
it O
is O
, O
" O
continued O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
, O
" O
that O
we O
all O
of O
us O
know O
so O
little O
of O
the O
|
     | O
poor O
people O
employed O
in O
the O
factories O
! O
I O
believe O
they O
are O
said O
to O
be O
exceedingly O
well O
paid O
, O
but O
|
     | O
still O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
is O
quite O
right O
for O
the O
rich O
people O
in O
a O
neighbourhood O
to O
take O
no O
notice O
|
     | O
whatever O
of O
the O
poor O
. O
I O
know O
it O
is O
not O
so O
in O
other O
places O
  O
for O
I O
have O
heard O
my O
schoolfellows O
|
     | O
continually O
talk O
of O
their O
fathers O
' O
tenants O
and O
work O
- O
people O
, O
and O
of O
their O
schools O
, O
and O
their O

     | O
clothing O
societies O
, O
and O
all O
sorts O
of O
things O
, O
and O
I O
have O
been O
trying O
to O
do O
a O
little O
good O
just O
at O
|
     | O
home O
with O
the O
families O
of O
some O
of O
the O
work O
- O
people O
about O
the O
place O
. O
But O
I O
have O
just O
now O
got O
my O
|
     | O
head O
strangely O
full O
of O
these O
factory O
folks O
. O
I O
wish O
you O
could O
give O
me O
some O
information O
about O

     | O
them O
, O
Martha B-PERSON

" O

   | O
get O
, O
and O
yet O
papa O
says O
that O
it O
is O
the O
very O
prettiest O
lightest O
work O
in O
the O
world O
. O
|
     | O
And O
indeed O
I O
am O
afraid O
it O
is O
but O
too O
true O
, O
for O
this O
little O
fellow O
, O
though O
he O
is O
so O
interesting O
|
     | O
and O
intelligent O
that O
it O
is O
impossible O
to O
help O
liking O
him O
, O
always O
speaks O
of O
the O
factory O
as O
if O
he O
|
     | O
hated O
it O
. O
" O

  | O
" O
And O
if O
he O
does O
hate O
it O
, O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
why O
, O
if O
you O
question O
him O
should O
he O
conceal O
it O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
But O
I O
never O
have O
questioned O
him O
about O
that O
  O
I O
should O
not O
think O
it O
right O
to O
do O
so O
. O
Only O
I O
|
     | O
remember O
his O
making O
me O
laugh O
, O
just O
after O
he O
came O
here O
, O
by O
saying O
something O
exceedingly O
|
        | O
naïve O
|  | O
about O
their O
all O
liking O
wages O
but O
not O
work O
. O
Now O
, O
though O
I O
am O
not O
very O
deep O
in O
|
     | O
political O
economy O
, O
it O
is O
impossible O
not O
to O
see O
that O
poor O
people O
must O
work O
for O
what O
they O
get O
— O
|
     | O
do O
n't O
you O
think O
so O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Assuredly O
, O
and O
rich O
people O
too O
. O
I O
have O
no O
doubt O
that O
both O
your O
father O
and O
my O
father O
had O
to O
|
     | O
work O
very O
hard O
for O
the O
fortunes O
which O
have O
rewarded O
their O
industry O
. O
In O
our O
class O
of O
life O
this O
|
     | O
is O
necessary O
. O
But O
that O
does O
not O
settle O
the O
question O
that O
is O
working O
in O
my O
head O
at O
present O
, O
and O

     | O
which O
, O
to O
tell O
you O
the O
truth O

will O
not O

me O
sleep O
by O
night B-TIME

amuse O
myself O
by O
day O

How O
comes O

     | O
it O
that O
ALL O
the O
people O
— O
the O
only O
phrases O
I O
have O
heard O
upon O

very O
comprehensive O

Beyond O
this O
was O
the O
bedchamber O
of O

     | O
Mademoiselle O

which O
again O
led O
to O
an O

school O

voices O
speaking O

no O

pleasant O
accents O
from O
this O
theatrical O

and O
the O
angry O

     | O
tones O
of O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON

himself O
were O
soon O
unmistakably O
audible O

whisper O

out O

the O

" O
|  
  | O
It O
was O
impossible O
to O
argue O
the O
point O
  O
so O
poor O
Martha B-PERSON
submitted O
, O
though O
cruelly O
distressed O
at O
|
     | O
the O
idea O
of O
her O
father O

private O
violence O
of O
temper O
being O
listened O
to O
by O
one B-CARDINAL

those O
who O

never O
seen O
Dowling B-PERSON

its O
inhabitants O

excepting O
in O
full O
dress O
. O
This O
distress O
was O
by O
no O
|
     | O
means O
lessened O
when O
some O
very O
audible O
words O
made O
it O
evident O
that O
Michael B-PERSON
Armstrong I-PERSON
was O
the O
|
     | O
object O
of O
the O
angry O
feelings O
to O
which O
he O
was O
now O
giving O
vent O
. O
As O
the O
best O
thing O
to O
be O
done O
|
     | O
under O
the O
circumstances O
  O
she O
pointed O
to O
a O
sofa O
at O
the O
greatest O
distance O
from O
the O
|
     | O
imperfectly O
- O
closed O
door O
from O
whence O
the O
sounds O
issued O
  O
but O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
had O
already O
dropped O

     | O
into O
a O
chair O
so O
near O
this O
door O
of O
communication O
that O
she O
not O
only O
heard O
, O
but O
saw O
all O
that O
was O
|
     | O
passing O
in O
that O
part O
of O
the O
green O
- O
room O
which O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling I-PERSON
occupied O
. O
That O
this O
was O
the O
|
     | O
last O
place O
in O
which O
a O
gentlewoman O
would O
have O
been O
likely O
to O
place O
herself O
at O
such O
a O
moment O
, O
is O
|
     | O
most O
certain O
  O
but O
the O
capricious O
heiress O
was O
wo O
nt O
to O
exclaim O
on O
many O
occasions O
, O
when O
observance O
|
     | O
and O
restraint O
were O
irksome O
to O
her O
, O
" O
I O
am O
not O
a O
gentlewoman O
— O
and O
why O
should O
I O
torment O
myself O
by O
|
     | O
affecting O
to O
be O
one O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
It O
was O
probably O
by O
some O
such O
reasoning O
that O
she O
now O
justified O
to O
herself O
the O
strong O
measure O

     | O
she O
was O
adopting O
  O
in O
order O
to O
become O
acquainted O
with O
what O
was O
passing O

behind O
the O

      | O
scenes O

respecting O
Michael B-PERSON
Armstrong I-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
Circumstances O
were O
favourable O
to O
the O
object O
  O
for O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
was O
in O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
those O
towering O
|
     | O
fits O
of O
passion O
, O
to O
which O
his O
family O
and O
dependants O
knew O
him O
to O
be O
subject O
, O
though O
the O
majority O
|
     | O
of O
the O
world O
declared O
him O
to O
be O
an O
extremely O
good O
- O
natured O
man O

Devil B-PERSON

— O
were O
among O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
intelligible O
words O
which O
|
     | O
reached O
the O
heiress O
, O
after O
she O
had O
seated O
herself O
  O
and O
these O
were O
accompanied O
by O
cuffs O
so O
heavy O

     | O
on O
the O
head O
and O
shoulders O
of O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
that O
it O
required O
a O
very O
powerful O
effort O
over O
herself O
to O
|
     | O
prevent O
her O
darting O
forward O
to O
seize O
the O
arm O
that O
gave O
them O
. O
But O
this O
prudent O
effort O
was O
|
     | O
dictated O
and O
sustained O
by O
a O
stronger O
feeling O
than O
curiosity O
  O
and O
she O
remained O
perfectly O
still O
|
     | O
to O
await O
what O
should O
follow O
. O

Dr. O
Crockley B-PERSON

who O
, O

not O

had O
been O
permitted O
to O
be O
useful O

behind O
the O
scenes O
in O
a O
variety O
of O
ways O

acted O

stood O
beside O

the O
trembling O

it O
was O
to O
his O
friendly O

up O

not O
altogether O
an O

hardly O
doubt O
that O

it O
was O
pretty O
certain O

that O

her O
a O
strength O
and O
firmness O
of O
purpose O
not O
easily O
shaken O
, O
the O
poor O
girl O
knew O
that O

stood O
alone O
in O
the O

with O
no O

more O

her O

in O
many O

that O
she O
feared O
might O
turn O
out O
rather O
difficult O

     | O
to O
manage O
. O

  | O
So O
she O
determined O
to O
avoid O
quarrelling O
with O
Sir O

as O
long O
as O
she O
could O
, O

struggling O
with O
his O

the O
plaintive O
sound O
of O
his O
voice O

     | O
he O
pleaded O
for O
leave O

absolutely O
haunted O

she O
determined O
upon O
being O

     | O
cautious O
, O
wise O
, O
and O
very O
deliberative O
in O
any O
measures O

might O
eventually O
take O
to O
ensure O
his O

     | O
release O
. O
| 
   | O
and O
conspicuous O
as O
carriage O

could O
be O
, O
and O
though O
she O
knew O
not O

     | O
precisely O
in O
what O
direction O
the O
widow O
Armstrong B-PERSON
might O
be O
found O
, O

was O
easy O
enough O
to O
guess O

     | O
that O
did O
she O
make O
use O
of O
her O
ordinary O
mode O
of O
conveyance O
in O
reaching O
her O

it O

It O
was O
to O

once O
more O
led O
the O
conversation O
to O

  | O
" O
You O

I O
told O
you O

altogether O

about O

" O
I O
am O

my O

replied O
the O
good O
woman O

gravely O
  O
" O
because O
I O
am O
quite O
sure O

better O

fancy O
that O
your O
manner O
of O

     | O
speaking O
on O
this O
dark O

is O
the O
way O
to O
check O
my O
curiosity O

It O
was O
pretty O
effectually O

     | O
awakened O
perhaps O
before O

had O
it O
been O
otherwise O

what O
you O

would O
be O

enough O

me O
upon O
inquiring O

Nurse O

I O
WILL O
know O
every O
thing O

the O
most O
persevering O

inquiry O

teach O
me O

labours O
all O
the O

This O
seems O

me O
so O

can O
not O

This O
, O
perhaps O
, O
may O
lead O
to O
intemperance O

you O
think O
this O

case O

" O

" O
Good O
gracious O
, O
no O

Miss O

! O
Why O
they O

" O
But O
they O
may O
be O
poor O
because O
they O
are O
extravagant O
, O
nurse O
. O
They O
must O
get O
a O
most O
monstrous O
|
     | O
quantity O
of O
money O
, O
for O
though O
none O
of O
the O
gentlemen O
ever O
talk O
much O
of O
their O
factories O
, O
I O
have O
|
     | O
repeatedly O
heard O
allusion O
made O
to O
the O
enormous O
sums O
paid O
every B-DATE
week I-DATE
to O
the O
work O
- O
people O
. O
And O
it O
|
     | O
is O
quite O
clear O
that O
all O
the O
families O
must O
get O
a O
great O
deal O
, O
because O
all O
the O
little O
children O

work O

can O
hardly O
be O
the O

elsewhere O
. O
Now O
, O
I O
can O
not O
help O
thinking O
, O

, O
that O
a O
great O

     | O
deal O
of O
good O
might O
be O
done O
by O
teaching O
them O
a O
little O
economy O
, O
and O
inducing O
them O
to O
lay O
by O
their O
|
     | O
superfluous O
money O
in O
a O
savings O

bank O
. O
That O
is O
one O
great O
reason O
why O
I O
want O
to O
get O
acquainted O
with O

     | O
the O
people O
themselves O

disgusting O

had O
him O
in O

the O

Hoxley B-PRODUCT

Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
talked O
so O
much O
of O
the O
fatigue O
, O
that O
the O
good O

natured O

     | O
girl O
consented O
to O
let O
the O

at O
which O
the O

diverged O

This O
yielding O
, O
however O
, O
was O
wholly O
from O
consideration O
for O
her O
companion O
. O
For O
herself O
|
     | O
she O
believed O
the O
precaution O
quite O
needless O
  O
and O
she O
was O
right O
. O
However O
much O
her O
temper O
might O

     | O
have O
been O
endangered O
by O
the O
series O
of O
spoiling O
processes O

had O
undergone O
, O
her O
health O
had O
been O

     | O
taken O
good O

and O
few O

greater O
power O

for O

herself O

Nevertheless O
, O
before O
she O
had O
driven O
half B-QUANTITY
a I-QUANTITY
mile I-QUANTITY
, O
she O
heartily O
rejoiced O
at O

own O
inclination O
to O
that O

of O

had O
she O
been O
seen O
on O
foot O
, O
it O
is O
probable O
|
     | O
that O
before O
reaching O
Hoxley B-ORG

she O
would O
have O
been O
surrounded O
by O
a O
body O

guard O
of O
military O

So O

     | O
greatly O
did O
this O
danger O
appal O
her O
spirits O
, O
that O
the O
frist O
moment O

found O
herself O
free O
from O
a O

     | O
white O
- O
gloved O
hand O
either O
at O
one B-CARDINAL
window O
or O
the O
other O
, O
she O
stopped O
the O
carriage O
, O
and O
ordered O
the O
|
     | O
coachman O
to O
go O
far O
enough O
down O
the O
lane O
to O
permit O

out O
unoberserved O

this B-DATE

to O
disappointment O

the O
indignant O
, O
and O
almost O
passionate O

     | O
beating O
of O
her O
heart O
under O
it O
, O
made O
her O
more O
conscious O
, O
perhaps O
, O
than O
she O
had O
ever O
been O
before O
, O

     | O
how O
deeply O
the O

himself O
equipped O

for O

inquired O

Whether O

and O
the O
evil O

     | O
star O
of O

to O
bring O

the O

" O

cried O
the O
young O

energetic O
pull O

gentle O

" O
The O
wretch O

muttered O
Mary B-PERSON
between O
her O
teeth O
at O
the O
very O
moment O
that O
sir O

on O

     | O
side O

and O
his O
languishing O
son O
on O
the O

besieged O
her O
carriage O

   | O
thought O
she O
, O
as O
with O
a O
face O
suffused O
with O
the O
deepest O
carmine O
that O
agitation O

     | O
could O
produce O

she O
forced O
her O
lips O
into O
an O
unmeaning O
smile O
in O

to O
their O
salutation O
. O

The O
father O

came O
to O
exactly O
the O

conclusion O

at O
the O

moment O
. O
There O
was O
but O

     | O
one O
cause O
that O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
assign O
for O
her O
evident O
emotion O

She O
was O
deeply O
in O
love O
with O

Augustus B-PERSON

— O
more O
deeply O
then O
even O
the O
young O
man O
himself O
had O
imagined O

The O
thing O
was O
plain O

no O

no O

with O
the O

     | O
assumed O
air O
of O
a O
partially O
loved O
friend O
, O
who O
knows O
that O
no O

asked O

  | O
Mary B-PERSON
shrunk O
back O
into O
her O
corner O
with O
considerably O
more O
disgust O
than O
if O
a O
reptile O
had O

     | O
possessed O
itself O
of O
the O
seat O
opposite O

" O
This O

not O
quite O

it O

it O

" O
said O
Sir O

with O
a O

" O

better O

And O
a O
very O
expressive O
smile O
accompanied O
the O

     | O
words O
. O

  | O
" O

  | O
An O
attempt O
to O
take O
her O
hand O
accompanied O
this O
speech O
  O
and O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
, O
who O
estimated O
pretty O

     | O
nearly O
her O
young O
lady O

affection O
for O
Sir O

his O
race O
, O
actually O
trembled O
for O
the O

     | O
consequences O
. O
But O
, O
to O
her O
great O
surprise O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
answered O
, O
after O
the O
pause O
of O
a O
minute O
, O
" O
Oh O
, O
dear O

Sir O

you O

only O
laughing O
at O

" O
in O
a O
voice O
so O
exceedingly O
chilldish B-NORP

silly O
, O
that O

it O
might O
, O
under O
similar O
circumstances O

have O
made O
the O
fortune O
of O
a O
comic O
actress O
  O
and O
though O
she O

     | O
did O
not O
permit O
him O
to O
touch O
the O
hand O
he O
attempted O
to O
take O
, O
she O
placed O
it O
, O
together O
with O
its O

     | O
fellow O
, O
so O
playfully O
behind O
her O
, O
that O
Sir O

could O
only O
laugh O

call O
her O

" O
dear O
pretty O

creature O

Meanwhile O
the O
carriage O
proceeded O
to O
penetrate O
through O
the O
dirty O
dismal O
streets O
, O
which O
, O
in O

     | O
that O
direction O

formed O

" O

springing O
to O
the O

ground O
the O
moment O
the O

knight O

fain O
to O
follow O

the O
animated O
Augustus B-PERSON

     | O
threw O
himself O
from O
his O
horse O
at O
the O
same O
instant O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
held O
herself O
suspended O
on O

     | O
the O
step O
of O
the O

to O
learn O

said O
Mary B-PERSON
, O

     | O
approaching O
a O

at O

, O
crouching O

sat O
a O

said O
the O

suddenly O
assuming O

the O
tone O

style O
of O

no O
further O
parley O

taking O
a O
ragged O
child O
in O

set O

her O
little O
foot O
against O
the O

complete O

there O
was O
little O
of O
selfishness O

much O
of O
courage O
in O
the O
heart O
of O
Mary B-PERSON

so O

     | O
she O
presently O
forgot O
every O

the O
act O

pronouncing O
the O
last O
words O
of O
this O

Miss O

     | O
opened O
the O
door O

stepped O
out O

the O
street O

  | O
On O
first B-ORDINAL
perceiving O
her O
, O
the O
knight O
appeared O
about O

take O
her O
hand O

for O
the O
purpose O
of O

     | O
replacing O
her O
in O
the O
carriage O
  O
but O
his O
attention O
was O
called O
to O
the O
sound O
of O
many O
feet O
suddenly O

     | O
turning O
the O
corner O
of O
a O
street O

led O
from O

species O
of O

take O
little O
or O
no O
pains O
to O
avoid O
meeting O
the O
people O

themselves O
employ O

They O

     | O
look O
not O

the O
young O
eyes O
to O
read O
what O
sort O
of O
blessing O

But O
such O

no O

Sir O

become O
aware O
that O
the O
mill O
in O
the O

     | O
next O
street O
was O
pouring O
forth O
its O
fifteen B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
hands O
, O
than O
he O
turned O
from O
the O
young O
lady O
who O

     | O
had O
passed O
by O
without O
appearing O

him O
, O

taking O
his O
horse O
from O
the O
hand O
of O
the O
groom O
who O

     | O
held O
it O
, O
sprung O
with O
great O
activity O
into O
the O
saddle O
, O
and O
galloped O
off O
the O
way O
his O
indignant O
son O

     | O
had O
galloped O
before O
him O

  | O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton I-PERSON
meanwhile O
was O
utterly O
unconscious O
of O
the O
approaching O
throng O
  O
and O
intent O
only O
|
     | O
upon O
getting O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
out O
of O
the O
carriage O

turned O
her O
eyes O
neither O

the O

     | O
left O
, O

seizing O
her O
by O
the O
arm O

exclaimed O

quite O

herself O
of O
the O
reunion O

required O
no O
second B-ORDINAL

     | O
summons O

more O
quickly O
than O
it O
can O

told O

was O
first B-ORDINAL
by O
the O
side O
of O
her O
young O
mistress O
in O

     | O
the O
street O
, O
and O
then O
entering O
with O
her O
the O
low O
door O
of O
the O
dwelling O
so O
fearfully O
described O
by O

     | O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
Had O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
possessed O
the O
power O

most O
assuredly O
she O
would O
have O
turned O
the O
steps O
of O
her O

     | O
charge O
the O
other O
way O

for O
ever O
have O
prevented O
her O
from O
exposing O
herself O
to O
the O
|
     | O
contemplation O
of O
such O
depravity O
as O
she O
had O
heard O
described O
  O
but O
knowing O
perfectly O
well O
that O
no O

     | O
such O
power O
was O
vested O
in O
her O
, O
the O
next O
wish O

conceived O
, O
was O
to O
give O
all O
the O
assistance O

     | O
support O

could O
to O
the O
dear O
wilful O
girl O
to O
whom O
she O

Aware B-ORG

them O

, O
that O
many O
steps O
were O

     | O
stayed O
, O
apparently O
, O
to O
watch O
the O
spectacle O
so O
rare O
in O
Ashleigh B-PERSON
of O
well O
- O
dressed O
ladies O
entering O

     | O
the O
sordid O
dwelling O
of O
operatives O
, O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
herself O
closed O
the O
door O
as O
soon O
as O
they O
had O
|
     | O
both O
passed O
through O
it O
, O
and O
looking O
round O
upon O
the O
desolation O
of O
the O
chamber O
, O
trembled O
with O
an O
|
     | O
emotion O
made O
up O
of O
terror O
and O
compassion O
, O
at O
perceiving O
to O
what O
a O
scene O
the O
delicately O
- O
nurtured O
|
     | O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton I-PERSON
had O
introduced O
herself O

" O
This O
woman O
is O
very O
ill O
, O
nurse O
Tremlett B-PERSON

" O
said O
the O
young O
lady O
, O
drawing O
her O
close O
to O
the O
bed O
. O
|
     | O
" O
For O
God O
's O

better O

Mary B-PERSON
come O
away O
, O
and O
send O
the O
doctor O
to O
her O
! O
" O
answered O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
  O
|
     | O
positively O
shaking O
from O
head O
to O
foot O
, O
as O
she O
contemplated O
the O
ghastly O
countenance O
of O
the O
woman O
, O
|
     | O
the O
filthy O
rag O
that O
imperfectly O
covered O
her O
, O
and O
the O
scanty O
straw O
upon O
which O
her O
stiffening O
|
     | O
limbs O
were O
stretched O
. O
" O
This O
is O
no O
place O
for O
you O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
! O
come O
with O
me O
I O
say O
this O
|
     | O
moment O
, O
and O
we O
will O
send O
the O
doctor O
, O
and O
money O
, O
and O
clothes O
too O
, O
if O
you O
like O
it O

" O
If O
I O
like O
it O

you O
think O
I O

amusing O
myself O

her O
hand O

feel O
her O

     | O
pulse O
! O
I O
believe O
she O
is O
dying O

" O
| 
  | O
These O
words O
though O
spoken O
very O
quietly O
and O
deliberately O
, O
were O
uttered O
in O
a O
voice O
so O
unlike O
|
     | O
what O
she O
had O
ever O
heard O
from O
the O
young O
lady O
before O
, O
that O
the O
old O
woman O
became O
dreadfully O

     | O
alarmed O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Oh O
, O
good O
God O
! O
she O
is O
losing O
her O
senses O
! O
" O
were O
the O
words O
she O
uttered O
as O
she O
threw O
her O
arms O
|
     | O
round O
the O
person O
of O
Miss B-PERSON
Brotherton I-PERSON
, O
and O
vainly O
attempted O
to O
remove O
her O
from O
the O
spot O
on O
which O
|
     | O
she O
stood O
. O

moment O

" O
I O

" O
|  
  | O
Without O
answering O
a O
word O
the O
terrified O
old O
woman O
hastened O
to O
obey O
her O
, O
and O
did O
so O
in O
the O
best O
|
     | O
manner O
  O
for O
calling O
to O
the O
tall O
footman B-PRODUCT
, O
who O
continued O
to O
stand O
beside O
the O
open O
door O
of O
the O
|
     | O
carriage O
, O
he O
obeyed O
the O
summons O
, O
which O
he O
supposed O
to O
be O
preparatory O
to O
his O
young O
mistress O
|
     | O
making O
her O
exit O
, O
by O
very O
unceremoniously O
thrusting O
right O
and O
left O
the O
curious O
group O
that O
still O
|
     | O
lingered O
on O
the O
threshold O

" O
Give O

Jones B-PERSON

! O
" O
| 
  | O
The O
man O
stared O
at O
her O
for O
an O
instant O
in O
utter O
astonishment O
, O
and O
then O
did O
as O
he O
was O
|
     | O
ordered O
. O
| 
  | O
" O

for O
him O

desire O
him O
to O
get O
into O
carriage O
directly O

" O
| 
  | O
Having O
uttered O
these O
commands O
as O
rapidly O
as O
she O
could O
speak O
, O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
carried O
a O
couple O

     | O
of O
the O
carriage O
cushions O
to O
the O
bed O
, O

with O
the O
assistance O
of O
Mary B-PERSON
and O
the O
elder O
child O
, O
|
     | O
managed O
to O
raise O
the O
woman O
into O
a O
position O
apparently O
less O
distorted O
and O
painful O
than O

     | O
before O

| 
  | O
" O
Have O
you O
any O
thing O
to O
give O
her O
? O
" O
said O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
, O
addressing O
the O
child O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
little O
girl O
without O
answering O
, O
stepped O
to O
a O
sort O
of O
cupboard O
in O
the O
wall O
, O
and O
taking O
|
     | O
thence O
a O
pitcher O
without O
a O
spout O
, O
and O
a O
mug O
without O
a O
handle O
, O
contrived O
to O
tilt O
up O
the O
former O

     | O
so O
as O
to O
make O
it O
discharge O
a O
portion O
of O
its O
cotents O
into O
the O
latter O
. O

" O

watching O

replied O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
, O
her O
eyes O
filling O
with O
tears O
as O

     | O
she O
listened O
to O
the O
altered O
voice O
of O
her O
gay O
- O
hearted O
girl O
, O
whose O
smiles O
and O
frolics O
she O
had O
|
     | O
watched O
, O
and O
indulged O
, O
for O
so O
many O
years O
  O
but O
of O
whose O
deep O
feeling O
she O
had O
never O
conceived O
any O
|
     | O
idea O
till O
now O
. O
" O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
anything O
can O
hurt O
her O
now O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
. O
Her O
pulse O
flutters O
, O
and O
her O
|
     | O
forehead O
is O
quite O
damp O
. O
I O
have O
sent O
for O
Mr. O
Thomas B-PERSON
, O
and O
he O
will O
probably O
be O
here O
|
     | O
immediately O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
only O
answer O
was O
silently O
pressing O
the O
hand O
of O
her O
old O
friend O
as O
she O
took O
from O
it O
the O
|
     | O
broken O
mug O
of O
water O
, O
and O
then O
, O
kneeling O
on O
the O
sordid O
floor O
, O
she O
applied O
it O
to O
the O
pale O
dry O
|
     | O
lips O
of O
the O
sufferer O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
poor O
woman O
made O
an O
effort O
to O
meet O
it O
, O
and O
swallowed O
a O
mouthful O
eagerly O
  O
and O
then O
, O
|
     | O
relieved O
probably O
by O
the O
change O
of O
posture O
, O
and O
refreshed O
by O
the O
cool O
liquid O
, O
she O
stretched O
out O
|
     | O
the O
hand O
in O
which O
she O
still O
held O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
half O
- O
crown O
, O
and O
said O
, O
" O
Go O
Betsy B-PERSON
, O
buy O
— O
" O
| 
  | O
The O
child O
she O
addressed O
, O
eagerly O
seized O
the O
money O
in O
the O
hand O
that O
had O
fingers O
to O
close O
upon O
|
     | O
it O
, O
and O
flitted O
through O
the O
door O
in O
an O
instant O
. O
| 
   | O
more O
tranquil O
, O
and O
Mary B-PERSON
hoped O
she O
had O
fallen O
asleep O
. O
With O
this O
persuasion O
she O
|
     | O
stood O
perfectly O
still O
and O
silent O
beside O
her O
, O
her O
own O
hand O
locked O
, O
though O
she O
was O
not O
conscious O
|
     | O
of O
it O
, O
in O
the O
grasp O
of O
her O
deeply O
affected O
nurse O
, O
while O
her O
whole O
soul O
seemed O
settled O
in O
her O
|
     | O
eyes O
as O
she O
fixed O
them O
immovably O
upon O
what O
she O
felt O
to O
be O
the O
most O
awful O
spectacle O
that O
a O
|
     | O
mortal O
can O
gaze O
upon O
, O
namely O
, O
the O
passing O
of O
a O
human O
spirit O
from O
life O
to O
death O
. O
|  
  | O
The O
little O
girl O
whose O
swollen O
and O
discoloured O
arm O
still O
remained O
uncovered O
, O
probably O
because O
|
     | O
she O
feared O
the O
pain O
likely O
to O
attend O
the O
replacing O
it O
in O
the O
sleeve O
, O
stood O
close O
beside O
her O
|
     | O
mother O
's O
head O
, O
childishly O
contemplating O
the O
cushions O
which O
supported O
it O
, O
and O
apparently O
as O
|
     | O
unconscious O
as O
they O
were O
, O
of O
the O
heavy O
loss O
that O
threatened O
her O
. O
| 
  | O
But O
this O
stillness O
did O
not O
long O
remain O
uninterrupted O
. O
All O
the O
members O
of O
the O
family O
, O
who O
had O
|
     | O
been O
named O
as O
belonging O
to O
the O
factory O
, O
except O
the O
father O
, O
returned O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
taking O
|
     | O
such O
rest O
and O
refreshment O
as O
one B-TIME
hour I-TIME
( O
nearly B-CARDINAL
half I-CARDINAL
of O
which O
was O
consumed O
by O
the O
walk O
to O
and O
|
     | O
from O
the O
mill O
) O
could O
permit O
. O
The O
latch O
was O
lifted O
by O
the O
eldest O
girl O
, O
a O
delicate O
featured O
, O
but O
|
     | O
dreadfully O
dirty O
creature O
of O
about B-CARDINAL
seventeen I-CARDINAL
, O
with O
a O
sort O
of O
sharp O
eagerness O
, O
denoting O
the O
|
     | O
curiosity O
excited O
by O
the O
sight O
of O
the O
carriage O
stationed O
before O
their O
dwelling O
. O
On O
perceiving O
|
     | O
the O
deathlike O
countenance O
of O
her O
mother O
, O
made O
distinctly O
visible O
by O
the O
noonday B-DATE
light O
, O
that O
|
     | O
streamed O
through O
the O
open O
door O
, O
she O
suddenly O
stopped O
, O
clasping O
her O
hands O
together O
, O
and O
uttering O
|
     | O
in O
tones O
that O
sounded O
like O
a O
shriek O
— O
" O
Oh O
! O
God O
, O
she O
is O
dead O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
No O
! O
not O
dead O
! O
" O
said O
Mary B-PERSON
solemnly O
, O
and O
without O
turning O
her O
eyes O
from O
the O
object O
on O
which O
|
     | O
they O
were O
rivetted O
. O
" O
Not O
dead O
! O
— O
she O
is O
sleeping O
— O
Hush O
! O
— O
Do O
not O
disturb O
her O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
Close O
following O
on O
the O
heels O
of O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
came O
a O
second B-ORDINAL
girl O
, O
about O
a O
year O
her O
junior O
, O
but O
|
     | O
with O
a O
countenance O
much O
less O
prepossessing O
. O
Dirty O
she O
was O
too O
, O
it O
possible O
more O
so O
than O
the O
|
     | O
others O
, O
and O
there O
was O
a O
look O
of O
stolid O
stupidity O
about O
her O
that O
, O
but O
for O
the O
sort O
of O
reckless O
|
     | O
audacity O
which O
lurked O
in O
her O
eye O
, O
might O
have O
given O
the O
idea O
of O
an O
almost O
brutal O
want O
of O
|
     | O
animation O
. O
A O
thin O
consumptive O
- O
looking O
lad O
of O
about B-CARDINAL
fourteen I-CARDINAL
, O
followed O
after O
her O
, O
and O
closed O
the O
|
     | O
door O
behind O
him O
as O
he O
entered O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Oh O
! O
mother O
! O
" O
he O
exclaimed O
as O
her O
sunken O
face O
caught O
his O
eye O
, O
" O
I O
wish O
I O
was O
alongside O
of O
ye O
, O
|
     | O
and O
then O
we O
'd O
be O
buried O
together O
! O
" O
And O
without O
appearing O
conscious O
of O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
|
     | O
strangers O
, O
he O
suddenly O
threw O
himself O
upon O
the O
tottering O
bedstead O
, O
and O
nestling O
his O
face O
close O
|
     | O
to O
that O
of O
the O
dying O
woman O
, O
kissed O
her O
passionately O
again O
and O
again O
. O
| 
   | O
but O
with O
distended O
and O
tearless O
eyes O
, O
that O
seemed O
to O
speak O
more O
of O
fear O
than O
|
     | O
love O
. O
|  
  | O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
looked O
anxiously O
into O
the O
face O
of O
her O
charge O
. O
It O
was O
deadly O
pale O
, O
and O
wore O
an O
|
     | O
expression O
of O
solemnity O
so O
new O
and O
strange O
, O
that O
the O
good O
woman O
threw O
her O
arms O
around O
her O
in O
an O
|
     | O
agony O
of O
fond O
anxiety O
, O
exclaiming O
, O
" O
My O
Mary O

away O
! O
you O
can O
do O
no O
good O

This O
scene O
is O
not O
a O
fit O
one O
for O
you O
to O
witness O

" O

  | O
" O
You O
mistake O

nurse O

It O

me O
, O
nurse O

     | O
Tremlett B-PERSON
! O
do O
not O

" O
Then O
after O
a O
short O
pause O
, O
during O
which O
her O
eyes O
were O
closed O
, O
and O
her O
hands O
|
     | O
crossed O
upon O
her O
breast O
, O
she O
again O
whispered O
, O
" O
Could O

not O
pray O
with O
me O

" O
My O
sweet O
girl O
, O
she O
will O
not O
hear O
you O

" O
said O
the O
old O
woman O
, O
while O
the O
tears O
streamed O

     | O
down O
her O
cheeks O
. O
" O
But O
you O
shall O
be O
satisfied O
my O
darling O

" O
and O
approaching O
the O
bed O
, O
and O
leaning O

     | O
over O
the O
girl O
who O
knelt O
beside O
it O
, O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
in O
a O
low O
but O
distinct O
voice O
pronounced O
the O
|
     | O
words O
, O
" O
Shall O
we O
pary O
with O
you O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
She O
was O
evidently O
heard O
and O
understood O
, O
for O
the O
hands O
that O
for O
some B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
had O
lain O

     | O
motionless O
, O
were O
with O
an O
effort O
brought O
together O
, O
and O
clasped O
in O
the O
attitude O
of O
prayer O
. O
Mary B-PERSON

     | O
who O
was O
eagerly O
watching O
her O
every O
movement O
, O
suddenly O
stepped O
forward O
, O
and O
gliding O
in O
between O
|
     | O
the O
eldest O
and O
the O
youngest O
girl O
, O
dropped O
on O
her O
knees O
beside O
them O

Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
following O

     | O
close O
behind O
her O

knelt O
also O
, O

then O
with O
tremlbing O
lips O
, O
and O
faltering O
voice O
, O
but O
slowly O
, O
|
     | O
distinctly O
, O
and O
most O
reverentially O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton I-PERSON
uttered O
the O
last O
and O
most O
impressive O
of O

     | O
those O
sentences O
in O
our O
litany O
which O
is O
followed O
by O
the O
solemn O
petition O
for O
deliverance O

it O
was O
|
     | O
with O
a O
throb O
of O
pleasure O
at O
her O
heart O
, O
and O
an O
exclamation O
of O
thanksgiving O
from O
her O
tongue O
, O
that O
|
     | O
she O
heard O
the O
dying O
woman O
answer O
" O
Amen O

  | O
Almost O
at O
the O
very O
instant O
she O
did O
so O

the O
latch O

again O
lifted O

Ashleigh B-PERSON

Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
was O
not O
conscious O
of O
ever O

having O
seen O
him O

he O
, O
like O
every O
one O
else O
in O
the O
neighbourhood O

perfectly O
well O
knew O

the O
heiress O
by O
sight O

now O
, O
even O
no O

in O
the O
awful O
chamber O
of O
death O
, O
bowed O
low O
before O

     | O
her O
. O
| 
  | O
It O
would O
not O
be O
easy O
to O
describe O
the O
feeling O
with O
which O
she O
turned O
away O
from O
this O
ill O
- O
timed O

     | O
demonstration O
of O
respect O

Yet O
it O
was O
with O
no O
harshness O
  O
for O
the O
struggle O
so O
often O
going O
on O

     | O
within O
us O
between O
our O
better O

our O
worser O
natures O
, O
was O
at O
this O
moment O
so O
decidedly O
in O
favour O

     | O
of O
all O
that O
was O
good O
in O
her O
young O
heart O
, O
that O
there O
was O
hardly O
place O
for O
any O
severer O
feeling O

     | O
than O
pity O
within O
it O
. O
| 
  | O
She O
had O
risen O
from O
her O
knees O
as O
he O
made O
his O
bow O
, O
and O
turning O
gravely O
towards O
him O
, O
said O

Sophy O
, O
the O
eldest O
girl O
seemed O
unconscious O
of O
what O
was O
going O
on O
, O
for O
she O
remained O
perfectly O
|
     | O
motionless O
on O
the O
spot O
where O
she O
had O
first B-ORDINAL
knelt O
down O
  O
while O
the O
third B-ORDINAL
sister O
, O
who O
had O
been O

     | O
sent O
on O
the O
poor O
mother O

last O
errand O
for O
bread O

room O
during O
the O
foregoing O
scene O

occupied O
the O
space O

her O
right O
hand O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton I-PERSON
having O

     | O
knelt O
on O
her O
left O
, O
so O
that O
there O
was O
scarcely O
space O
for O
the O
approach O
of O
the O
smart O

     | O
apothecary O
| 
  | O
" O
Move O
, O
my O
dear O
girls O
! O
" O
said O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
gently O
laying O
a O
hand O
on O
the O
shoulder O
of O
each O
. O
| 
  | O
They O
both O
rose O
  O
while O
Mr. O
Thomas B-PERSON
, O
carefully O
storing O
the O
anecdote O
in O
aid O
of O
the O
gossiping O
part O
|
     | O
of O
his O
practice O
, O
looked O
and O
listened O
with O
astonishment O
to O
what O
seemed O
to O
him O
the O
very O
|
        | O
unnatural O
conduct O
|  | O
of O
the O
rich O
young O
lady O
, O
and O
internally O
exclaimed O
, O
" O
A O
clear O
case O
of O

     | O
religious O
mania O
this O
, O
as O
I O
ever O
saw O
! O
She O
wo O
n't O
live O
long O
, O
probably O
. O
What O
a O
match O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
It O
required O
no O
very O
long O
examination O
of O
the O
poor O
patient O
, O
to O
discover O
that O
her O
last O
moment O
|
     | O
was O
rapidly O
approaching O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Upon O
my O
word O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
, O
I O
really O
wish O
I O
could O
persuade O
you O
to O
come O
away O

persisted O

     | O
the O
medical O
gentleman O
as O
he O
once O
more O
turned O
towards O
her O
. O
The O
air O
is O
becoming O
more O
mephitic O

     | O
every O
instant O
. O
" O
This O
woman O
is O
at O
the O
last O
extremity O

" O
Nothing O
, O
then O
, O
can O
be O
done O
for O
her O

said O
Mary B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
" O
No O
, O
ma'am O
— O
nothing O
in O
the O
world O
. O
Not O
the O
whole O
college O
, O
if O
they O
were O
present O
, O
could O
keep O

     | O
soul O

body O
together O

another B-TIME

venture O

say O

" O
| 
  | O
On O
this O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
put O
a O
fee O
into O
his O
hand O
, O
and O
bent O
her O
head O
in O
token O
that O
his O
business O
|
     | O
there O
was O
ended O
, O
and O
that O
he O
might O
depart O
. O
But O
he O
did O
not O
immediately O
obey O
the O
hint O
, O
for O
|
     | O
pocketing O
the O
unwonted O
golden O
prize O
, O
he O
seemed O
anxious O
to O
remain O
a O
little O
longer O
where O
such O
|
     | O
blessings O
abounded O
, O
and O
returning O
to O
the O
bed O
, O
again O
took O
hold O
of O
the O
poor O
woman O
's O
hand O
, O
and O
|
     | O
then O
said O
in O
a O
voice O
of O
authority O
— O
" O
Let O
me O
have O
some O
water O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
It O
was O
Mary B-PERSON
only O
who O
seemed O
to O
understand O
his O
words O
, O
and O
she O
immediately O
obeyed O
them O
, O
placing O
|
     | O
in O
his O
hand O
the O
broken O
mug O
which O
she O
had O
set O
aside O
upon O
the O
floor O
. O
The O
apothecary O
put O
the O
water O
|
     | O
to O
the O
lips O
of O
the O
poor O
woman O
, O
and O
she O
again O
swallowed O
a O
little O
of O
it O
, O
after O
which O
they O
saw O
her O
|
     | O
lips O
move O
as O
if O
she O
was O
making O
an O
effort O
to O
speak O
to O
them O
. O
| 
  | O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
lent O
over O
her O
, O
and O
then O
, O
with O
a O
stronger O
effort O
she O
articulated O
— O
" O
Let O
me O
see O

     | O
William B-PERSON
! O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Who O
is O
William B-PERSON

" O
said O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
raising O
herself O
, O
" O

it O
one O
of O
the O
children O

" O

Betsy B-PERSON
. O

" O
Where O
is O
he O
to O
be O
found O
? O
" O
cried O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
, O
eagerly O
. O
" O
Let O
him O
be O
sought O
for O
instantly O
— O

     | O
where O

likely O

" O
| 
  | O
" O
At O
the O
gin O

shop O

replied O
the O
ungracious O
Grace B-ORG
. O
| 
  | O
" O
If O
you O
know O
where O
he O
is O
, O
go O
for O
him O

Mary B-PERSON
, O
impressively O
, O
" O
and O
for O
God O

sake O

him O

     | O
not O
delay O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
The O
girl O
she O
addressed O
stared O
at O
her O
as O
upon O
something O
utterly O
incomprehensible O
: O
but O
she O
|
     | O
obeyed O
, O
and O
, O
in O
so O
short O
a O
time O
as O
to O
show O
that O
the O
gin O
- O
shop O
was O
at O
no O
great O
distance O
, O
returned O
|
     | O
with O
a O
man O
of O
an O
exterior O
as O
filthy O
as O
the O
rest O
of O
his O
race O
, O
wretchedly O
crippled O
in O
the O
legs O
, O
|
     | O
and O
a O
complexion O
that O
spoke O
both O
of O
ill O
health O
, O
and O
intemperance O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
What O
! O
— O
It O
is O
come O
to O
that O
, O
is O
it O
, O
already O
? O
" O
said O
the O
man O
looking O
wistfully O
at O
her O
from O
the O
|
     | O
bottom O
of O
the O
bed O
, O
but O
with O
a O
countenance O
whose O
lines O
seemed O
too O
fixed O
in O
the O
expression O
of O
|
     | O
hard O
indifference O
, O
to O
permit O
its O
exhibiting O
much O
feeling O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
She O
asked O
for O
you O
, O
father O
, O
" O
said O
Sophy B-EVENT
gently O
, O
then O
taking O
one O
of O
her O
mother O
's O
hands O
in O
hers O
|
     | O
she O
murmured,"Mother O
! O
— O
Dear O
mother O
! O
— O
open O
your O
eyes O
upon O
us O
, O
father O

here O
, O

all O
of O
us O

|
     | O
while O
large O
tear O
- O
drops O
fell O
upon O
the O
livid O
face O
as O
she O
hung O
over O
it O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
dying O
eyes O
were O
once O
more O
opened O
, O
and O
consciousness O
, O
and O
recognition O
of O
them O
all O
, O
were O
|
     | O
visible O
as O
she O
suffered O
them O
to O
rest O
first B-ORDINAL
on O
one O
, O
and O
then O
on O
another O
. O
The O
boy O
only O
, O
from O
his O
|
     | O
position O
, O
she O
could O
not O
see O
  O
but O
even O
then O
, O
there O
seemed O
intelligence O
between O
them O
, O
and O
she O
|
     | O
certainly O
knew O
he O
was O
lying O
beside O
her O
, O
for O
her O
head O
rested O
against O
his O
, O
and O
she O
raised O
her O
|
     | O
left O
hand O
till O
her O
fingers O
touched O
his O
cheek O
. O
The O
youngest O
child O
also O
when O
the O
mother O
's O
eyes O
|
     | O
opened O
, O
was O
too O
much O
behind O
her O
, O
but O
she O
seemed O
aware O
of O
her O
vicinity O
, O
and O
pronounced O
the O
words O
|
        | O
" O
Little O
one O
! O
" O
|  | O
probably O
her O
usual O
appellation O
, O
so O
distinctly O
as O
to O
make O
the O
child O
|
     | O
start O
, O
and O
instantly O
climb O
upon O
the O
bed O
to O
kiss O
her O
. O
The O
last O
movement O
was O
an O
effort O
to O
return O
|
     | O
this O
kiss O
  O
and O
the O
next O
moment O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
removed O
the O
child O
's O
clinging O
lips O
from O
a O
|
     | O
corse O
. O
| 
  | O
A O
very O
awful O
interval O
of O
perfect O
stillness O
followed O
. O
" O
Can O
I O
be O
of O
any O
further O
service O
to O
you O
, O

     | O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
? O
" O
from O
the O
lips O
of O
Mr. O
Thomas B-PERSON
, O
were O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
words O
that O
broke O
it O
. O
| 
  | O
Poor O
Mary O
only O
shook O
her O
head O
, O
but O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
replied O
, O
" O
No O
, O
thank O
you O
sir O
, O
nothing O
more O
  O
" O
|
     | O
and O
with O
repeated O
bows O
, O
and O
rather O
a O
reluctant O
step O
, O
he O
departed O
  O
turning O
, O
however O
, O
to O
give O
|
     | O
another O
glance O
at O
the O
heiress O
, O
as O
he O
passed O
out O
, O
for O
he O
was O
not O
without O
hopes O
that O
she O
might O

     | O
fall O
down O
in O
a O
fainting O
- O
fit O
. O
Nothing O
, O
however O
, O
of O
the O
kind O
happened O
, O
and O
he O
disappeared O
. O

" O
You O
will O
go O
now O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
dear O

whispered O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
, O
" O

I O
will O
come O
here O

" O
Yes O

replied O
the O
young O
lady,"I O

" O
Then O
looking O
round O
upon O

     | O
the O
steadfast O
group O
, O
as O
if O
to O
discover O
which O
of O
them O
appeared O
in O
the O
fittest O
state O
of O
be O
spoken O

     | O
to O
, O
she O
fixed O
upon O
the O
little O
Betsy B-PERSON
, O
and O
placing O
a O
couple O
of O
sovereigns O
in O
her O
hand O
, O
told O
her O

     | O
to O
take O
care O
of O
them O

give O
them O
to O
her O
father O
presently O
, O
adding O
, O
" O
tell O
your O

" O

She O
then O
led O
the O
way O
to O
her O
carriage O
, O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
followed O
, O
and O
the O
next O
moment O
they O
were O

     | O
driving O
rapidly O
from O
the O
abode O
of O
the O
most O
abject O
misery O
, O
to O
a O
residence O
which O
every O
quarter O
of O
|
     | O
the O
globe O
had O
contributed O
to O
render O
luxurious O
. O
| 
  | O
It O
was O
evident O
that O
the O
heiress O
felt O
no O
inclination O
to O
converse O
  O
indeed O
, O
for O
by O
far O
the O
|
     | O
greater O
portion O
of O
the O
way O
her O
face O
was O
concealed O
by O
the O
bandkerchief O
which O
she O
held O
to O
her O
|
     | O
eyes O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
had O
too O
much O
real O
feeling O
to O
disturb O
her O
. O
After O
driving O
, O
however O
, O

     | O
through O
the O
handsome O
lodge O

gates O
, O
and O
sweeping O
up O
to O
the O
noble O
entrance O
of O
her O
mansion O
, O
where O

     | O
already O
, O
at O
the O
sound O
of O
her O
approaching O
carriage O
, O
two B-CARDINAL
or O
three B-CARDINAL
servants O

seen O
waiting O
like O

     | O
a O
guard O
of O
honour O
to O
receive O
her O
, O
it O
seemed O
that O
her O
meditations O
had O
not O
been O
wholly O
confined O

     | O
to O
the O
deathbed O

cabin O

its O
misery O

made O
a O
deep O
impression O

you O

I O

already O

one O

I O

that O
this B-PERSON

grim O

Sir O

that O
it O
was O
a O
good O
deal O
talked O
about O
among O

the O
servants O

then O
t'other O
of O
'em O
blubbering O
away O
at O
the O
mill O
, O
must O
give O

it O

me O

a O
very O
ominous O
frown O

Sir O

said O
the O
overlooker O

preparing O

replied O
the O
knight O

Whereupon O
Mr. O
Parsons B-PERSON
made O
a O
bow O
, O
and O
departed O
. O

  | O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling I-PERSON
had O
already O
taken O
one B-CARDINAL
tumbler O
of O
hock O
- O
and O
- O
water O
. O
He O
now O
took O
a O
second B-ORDINAL
, O

     | O
and O
then O
throwing O
himself O
back O
in O
his O
arm O
- O
chair O
, O
indulged O
for O
several B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
in O
very O
deep O
|
     | O
meditation O
. O
At O
the O
end O
of O
that O
time O
it O
seemed O
as O
if O
the O
good O
Rhine B-LOC
wine O
had O
done O
its O
office O
, O
|
     | O
for O
suddenly O
the O
knight O

countenance O
became O
animated O
  O
the O
heavy O
gloom O
which O
had O
rested O
upon O
it O

     | O
disappeared O
, O
and O
springing O
to O
his O
feet O
he O
rang O
the O
bell O
with O
a O
sort O
of O
lively O
jerk O
which O
showed O
|
     | O
he O
had O
some O
project O
in O
hand O
that O
he O
greatly O
relished O
. O

It O
was O
the O
lively O
Peggy B-PERSON
who O
answered O
the O
summons O
  O
but O
though O
she O
entered O
almost O
out O
of O
breath O

     | O
from O
the O
eagerness O
with O
which O
she O
had O
traversed O
the O
passage O
which O
led O
from O
the O
kitchen O
to O
the O

     | O
study O
, O

though O
she O
brought O
into O
immediate O
activity O
all O
the O

agaceries O

of O
which O
she O

     | O
was O
capable O

a O
smiling O
nod O

all O
she O
got O
in O

eager O

Sir O

  | O
Peggy B-PERSON

disappointed O

angry O

had O
a O
great O
deal O

tell O
Sir O

about O

ungratefulness O
, O
and O
all O
that O
the O
servants O
thought O

said O
about O
it O
  O
but O
the O

     | O
command O
she O
had O
received O
was O
too O
peremptory O

trifled O
with O

she O
very O
nearly O

     | O
slammed O
the O

shutting O

instantly O
obeyed O

very O
uncomfortable O

can O

you O
mean O

was O
particularly O
so O
. O
You O
know O
the O
fuss O
that O
has O
been O
made O
about O
this O
little O

     | O
fellow O
that O
I O
have O
taken O
out O
of O
the O
factory O

I O
do O
assure O
you O
, O
my O
dear O
girl O
, O
that O
I O
really O
|
     | O
intended O
to O
be O
a O
very O
kind O
friend O
to O
him O
. O
But O
I O
got O
so O
provoked O
at O
his O
crying O
upon O
the O
stage O
|
     | O
last B-TIME
night I-TIME
in O
that O
beautiful O
speech O
that O
was O
written O
for O
him O
, O
that O
I O
cuffed O
him O
soundly O
for O
it O
|
     | O
when O
he O
came O
off O
— O
and O
I O
am O
sadly O
afraid O
that O
I O
frightened O
the O
poor O
little O
fellow O
so O
violently O
|
     | O
that O
he O
will O
never O
feel O
comfortable O
, O
and O
at O
his O
ease O
with O
me O
again O
. O
You O
can O
not O
think O
how O
this O

     | O
vexes O
me O
. O
" O
|  
  | O
" O
Oh O
! O
my O
dear O
papa O
, O
he O
will O
never O
remember O
it O
any O
more O
if O
you O
will O
please O
to O
forgive O
him O
. O

     | O
Martha B-PERSON
's O
heart O
bounded O
with O
joy O
as O
she O
spoke O
, O
to O
think O
how O
completely O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON

opinion O

     | O
would O
be O
changed O

she O

hear O
her O
father O
speak O
thus O
amiably O
of O
what O
had O
passed O
. O

" O
No O
, O
Martha B-PERSON

no O
  O
I O
can O
not O
bear O
to O
see O
his O
frightened O
look O

And O
besides O
, O
my O
dear O

I O
shall O

     | O
never O
be O
sure O
of O
myself O
— O
you O
know O
how O
hasty O
I O
am O
! O
— O
I O
should O
live O
in O
perpetual O
terror O
lest O
any O

     | O
thing O
should O
tempt O
me O
to O
give O
him O
a O
cuff O

There O
are O
other O
reasons O
too O
, O
my O
dear O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
which O

     | O
induce O
me O
to O
think O
that O
I O
should O
be O
doing O
the O
little O
fellow O

his O
family O
infinitely O
more O

     | O
service O
if O
I O
apprenticed O
him O
to O
some O
good O

he O
could O
ever O
gain O

" O

  | O
The O
excellent O
good O
sense O
of O
this O
observation O
struck O
Martha B-PERSON
as O
very O
valuable O
, O
and O
she O
uttered O
|
     | O
the O
most O
cordial O
approbation O
of O
the O
wisdom O
and O
goodness O
from O
whence O
it O
proceeded O
. O

" O
I O
am O
exceedingly O
glad O
you O
agree O
with O
me O

proceeded O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
, O
" O
for O
I O
have O

     | O
an O
idea O
that O
you O
could O
be O
very O
useful O
in O
making O
the O
arrangement O

Do O
you O
happen O
to O
know O
where O

     | O
the O
little O
boy O

mother O
lives O

" O
No O

papa O
— O
but O
Michael B-PERSON
could O
show O
me O
. O
" O

" O
Then O
you O
should O
have O
no O
objection O
to O
pay O
her O
a O
visit O

this O
business O

so O
much O

" O
Very O
well O

my O
love O

you O
shall O
set O
out O
immediately O
if O
you O
will O
. O
Or O
stay O
— O
it O
would O
|
     | O
perhaps O
be O
better O
to O
get O
you O
the O
paper O
first B-ORDINAL
that O
they O
will O
have O
to O
sign O

You O
must O

them O
, O
Martha B-PERSON

that O
I O
shall O
undertake O
to O
pay O
all O
the O
fees O

It O
certainly O
is O
an O
excellent O

     | O
thing O
for O
a O
poor O
family O

, O
to O
have O
a O
boy O

prenticed O
to O
a O
good O
trade O

I O
trust O
the O

will O
not O
refuse O
her O
consent O
from O
any O
selfish O
notion O

that O
she O
may O
lose O
the O
boy O
's O
help O

     | O
thereby O
, O
it O
would O
be O
really O
very O
wicked O

You O
may O
tell O
her O
, O
my O

that O
I O
shall O
continue O

send O
her O
down O
nice O

nourishing O
food O

and O
that O
little O
Michael B-PERSON
shall O
be O
taught O
to O
write O
, O
and O
|
     | O
well O
instructed O
every O
way O
  O
so O
she O
may O
be O
quite O
easy O
about O
him O
, O
and O
he O
will O
be O
sure O
to O
send O
her O

     | O
a O
letter O
every O
now O
and O
then O
. O
" O
The O
knight O
concluded O
with O
a O
smile O
of O
kindness O
, O
that O
perfectly O

     | O
enchanted O
his O

down O

him O
at O
once O

of O

sent O

out O
to O
his O
young O

Miss O

so O

she O
speedily O
became O
aware O
that O
the O
region O
was O
as O
unpleasant O
as O

     | O
it O
was O
new O

almost O
mechanically O

the O
considerate O
Martha B-PERSON

     | O
The O
child O
did O
so O
, O
but O
in O
this O
case O
there O
was O
no O
means O
for O
preparation O

having O
named O
the O

     | O
unexpected O
visitant O

given O
his O
mother O
a O
hasty O
kiss O

he O
returned O
before O
Martha B-PERSON

recovered O

     | O
the O
sort O
of O
shock O
which O
the O
dirty O

desolate O
spot O
on O
which O
she O
stood O
had O
occasioned O

trees O

the O
black O
tint O
of O
the O
loathsome O
factory O
seems O
to O
rest O
upon O
every O
object O
|
     | O
near O
it O
. O
The O
walls O
are O
black O

the O
fences O
are O
black O
, O
the O
window O
- O
panes O
( O
when O
there O
are O

     | O
all O
veiled O
in O
black O

that O
pertinaciously O
exists O
within O
their O
tainted O

     | O
purlieus O
, O

wears O
the O

dark O
hue O

perhaps O
there O
is O
no O
condition O

wretchedness O

Martha B-PERSON
Dowling I-PERSON
shuddered O
as O
she O
looked O
around O
her O
  O

when O
Michael B-PERSON
returned O
to O
lead O
her O
in O
, O

     | O
she O
felt O
half B-CARDINAL
afraid O
of O
crossing O
the O
gloomy O
threshold O
. O

But O
the O
widow O
Armstrong B-PERSON
was O
, O
as O
usual O
, O
less O
dirty O
in O
her O
abject O
misery O
than O
, O
perhaps O
, O
any O

     | O
other O
inhabitant O
of O
Hoxley B-ORG
- O
lane O
, O
or O
its O
immediate O
neighbourhood O
, O
and O
the O
mild O
countenance O
and O
|
     | O
gentle O
voice O
with O
which O
she O
replied O
to O
the O
young O
lady O
's O
salutation O
removed O
all O
her O
scruples O
, O
|
     | O
and O
she O
seated O
herself O
in O
the O
chair O
placed O
for O
her O
by O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
with O
the O
best O
disposition O
in O
the O

     | O
world O
to O
improve O
the O
acquaintance O

" O
I O
hope O
you O
are O
getting O
better O

Mrs. O
Armstrong B-PERSON

" O
said O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
in O
that O
tone O
of O
genuine O
female O

     | O
softness O

it O
is O
so O
impossible O
to O
mistake O
, O
" O

that O
you O
do O
n't O
miss O

much O

replied O

     | O
the O
poor O
woman O
, O
in O
a O
voice O
that O
indicated O
something O
like O
surprise O

which O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
who O
had O

     | O
stationed O
himself O
near O
enough O
to O
enable O
him O
to O
slip O
his O
little O
hand O
into O
hers O
, O
said O
, O
with O
a O

     | O
tolerably O
expressive O
emphasis O

Martha B-PERSON

that O
the O
mother O

fear O
of O

was O
combating O
the O
wiser O

     | O
hope O
for O
his O
future O
advantage O

fully O
conscious O
that O
the O
continuing O
his O

mode O
of O
life O

     | O
could O
only O
be O
productive O
of O
mortification O

she O
boldly O
answered O
this O
appeal O
, O
and O
in O
the O

     | O
confiding O
innocence O
of O

ventured O

does O
at O

I O

do O
think O

that O

he O
may O

is O
my O
opinion O

now O
ask O

poor O

Martha B-PERSON
confessed O
her O
ignorance O
on O
this O
point O

added O
, O
that O
though O
she O
should O
be O
sorry O

hear O
it O

wonderfully O

ran O
on O

that O

It O
was O
not O
till O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
dinner O
- O
bell O
had O
rung O
, O
that O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
ventured O
to O
seek O
Mary B-PERSON
in O
|
     | O
her O
chamber O
. O
| 
   | O
feelings O
of O
her O
young O
mistress O
had O
been O
violently O
affected O
by O
the O
scene O
they O
had O
|
     | O
witnessed O
, O
and O
though O
far O
perhaps O
from O
comprehending O
the O
effect O
it O
had O
produced O
on O
her O
mind O
, O
|
     | O
she O
was O
conscious O
that O
she O
should O
do O
no O
good O
by O
obtruding O
herself O
uncalled O
- O
for O
upon O
her O
|
     | O
retirement O
. O
|  
  | O
But O
when O
the O
signal O
that O
always O
brought O
them O
together O
had O
passed O
unheeded O
, O
she O
became O
uneasy O
, O
|
     | O
and O
availing O
herself O
of O
the O
privilege O
that O
long O
and O
well O
- O
requited O
affection O
gave O
, O
she O
knocked O
|
     | O
at O
her O
door O
and O
called O
upon O
her O
name O
. O
| 
  | O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
answered O
the O
summons O
immediately O
  O
but O
her O
withdrawing O
the O
bolt O
of O
her O
door O
, O
|
     | O
as O
well O
as O
the O
unchanged O
appearance O
of O
her O
dress O
, O
showed O
that O
she O
had O
not O
been O
occupied O
in O
|
     | O
preparing O
for O
dinner O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
You O
are O
not O
aware O
how O
late O
it O
is O
, O
my O
dear O
child O

The O
second B-ORDINAL
dinner O
- O
bell O
has O
rung O
! O
" O
said O
Mrs. O
|
     | O
Tremlett B-PERSON
looking O
anxiously O
in O
her O
pale O
face O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Has O
it O
? O
" O
replied O
the O
young O
lady O
  O
" O
indeed O
, O
I O
beg O
your O
pardon O
— O
but O
I O
will O
not O
keep O
you O

     | O
waiting O
, O
I O
will O
not O
dress O
to O

day O
if O
you O
will O
excuse O
it O
. O
" O

  | O
" O
No O
, O
no O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
that O
wo O
n't O
do O
. O
Never O
mind O
about O
the O
dinner O
I O
will O
tell O
them O
to O
take O
it O
out O
|
     | O
again O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Indeed O
I O
do O
not O
wish O
to O
dress O
, O
" O
said O
Mary B-PERSON
languidly O
. O
" O
Morgan B-ORG
will O
tease O
me O
by O
asking O
what O
|
     | O
dress O
I O
choose O
to O
wear O
and O
fifty B-CARDINAL
questions O
besides O
. O
Let O
me O
go O
down O
as O
I O
am O

nurse O

Tremlett B-PERSON

" O

  | O
" O
You O

have O
Morgan B-PERSON
at O
all O
dear O
. O
The O
dressing O
will O
refresh O
you O
my O
darling O
child O
  O
and O
it O

     | O
wo O
n't O
be O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
that O
I O
have O
done O
all O
that O
you O
wanted O
in O
that O
way O
. O
There O
— O
just O
|
     | O
sit O
down O
on O
the O
sofa O
for O
one B-TIME
minute I-TIME
, O
and O
I O
will O
speak O
about O
the O
dinner O
, O
and O
be O
back O
again O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
It O
was O
very O
passively O
that O
Mary B-PERSON
did O
as O
she O
was O
bid O
, O
and O
without O
another O
word O
of O
remonstrance O
|
     | O
sat O
down O
and O
awaited O
the O
return O
of O
her O
old O
friend O
. O
She O
was O
indeed O
completely O
exhausted O
, O
the O
|
     | O
scene O
she O
had O
witnessed O
had O
not O
touched O
only O
, O
it O
had O
wrung O
her O
heart O
  O
and O
the B-TIME
hours I-TIME
she O
had O
|
     | O
passed O
since O
, O
were O
not O
such O
as O
to O
bring O
her O
spirits O
back O
to O
their O
ordinary O
tone O
. O
It O
was O
not O
|
     | O
alone O
, O
the O
melancholy O
spectacle O
of O
a O
fellow O
- O
creature O
passing O
from O
life O
to O
death O
, O
which O
had O
thus O
|
     | O
strongly O
affected O
her O
— O
it O
was O
the O
frightful O
degradation O
of O
the O
group O
of O
human O
beings O
who O
had O
|
     | O
gazed O
upon O
it O
with O
her O
. O
It O
was O
the O
horrible O
recollection O
of O
the O
dying O
woman O
's O
statement O
|
     | O
respecting O
the O
lacerated O
flesh O
of O
her O
child O
— O
and O
it O
was O
the O
filth O
, O
the O
misery O
, O
the O
famine O
, O
and O
|
     | O
the O
vice O
that O
she O
had O
been O
warned O
of O
, O
and O
had O
seen O
, O
which O
had O
set O
her O

     | O
unprejudiced O

equal O

regularity O
( O
all O
booked O
for O
the O

a O
plentiful O
portion O
of O
benevolent O
lamentations O
over O

     | O
the O
sable O
sons O
of O
Africa B-LOC
, O
all O
uttered O
comfortably O
from O
a O
soft O
arm O

chair O

digestion O
was O

     | O
gently O
going O
on O

enjoyment O

On O
the O

     | O
slavery O
question O
therefore O
Mary B-PERSON
really O
knew O
a O
great O
deal O
, O
and O
felt O
concerning O
it O
as O
every O
true O

     | O
Christian B-NORP
must O
feel O
. O
But O
as O
to O
every O

the O
nature O
of O
the O
labour O
performed O
in O
the O

     | O
factories O
by O
whose O
chimneys O
her O
pleasant O
park O
was O
surrounded O

the O
age O

condition O

of O

the O
labourers O
— O
the O
proportion O
of O

daily B-DATE
existence O
devoted O
to O
toil O

the O
degree O
of O
care O

bestowed O
on O

souls O

them O

one O
— O
of O
all O
this O
|
     | O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton I-PERSON
was O
as O
ignorant O
as O
the O
sleek O
lapdog O
that O
dozed O
upon O
her O
hearth O
- O
rug O
. O
But O
this O
|
     | O
carefully O
- O
adjusted O
cloud O
was O
now O
passing O
away O
from O
her O
intellect O
for O
ever O
. O
If O
" O
Where O
ignorance O
|
     | O
is O
bliss O
, O
it O
is O
folly O
to O
be O
wise O
, O
" O
that O
folly O
had O
seized O
upon O
her O
  O
for O
no O
longer O
was O
she O
|
     | O
destined O
to O
taste O
the O
doubtful O
joy O
of O
luxury O
that O
had O
never O
looked O
upon O
the O
seamy O
side O
of O
|
     | O
existence O
, O
or O
dreamed O
that O
the O
means O
that O
supplied O
its O
exquisite O
, O
yet O
almost O
unnoted O
|
     | O
refinements O
, O
were O
earned O
by O
the O
agony O
of O
labouring O
infants O
. O
But O
though O
this O
, O
worse O
than O
fools O
|
     | O
paradise O
, O
was O
thus O
closed O
upon O
her O
for O
ever O
, O
she O
felt O
a O
power O
and O
energy O
of O
purpose O
awaked O
|
     | O
within O
her O
heart O
, O
that O
she O
thanked O
God O
upon O
her O
bended O
knees O
for O
giving O
, O
though O
she O
trembled O
as O
|
     | O
she O
received O
it O
. O
And O
never O
did O
sainted O
nun O
breathe O
purer O
or O
more O
earnest O
vows O
of O
self O
- O
devotion O
|
     | O
to O
heaven O
, O
than O
did O
this O
ardent O
- O
spirited O
girl O
to O
the O
examination O
, O
and O
, O
if O
possible O
, O
to O
the O

     | O
relief O
of O
the O
misery O
she O
had O
at O
length O
learned O
to O
know O
existed O
round O
her O
. O
|  
  | O
But O
like O
most O
other O
persons O
when O
occupied O
by O
a O
really O
profound O
emotion O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
felt O
no O
|
     | O
inclination O
to O
talk O
about O
it O
. O
She O
had O
not O
indeed O
the O
slightest O
intention O
to O
conceal O
any O
thing O
|
     | O
she O
did O
from O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
, O
but O
on O
the O
contrary O
hoped O
eventually O
to O
gain O
much O
assistance O
from O
|
     | O
her O
strong O
practical O
good O
sense O
  O
but O
she O
could O
not O
discuss O
, O
she O
could O
not O
reason O
, O
she O
could O
not O
|
     | O
prate O
about O
it O
now O
, O
and O
she O
went O
through O
the O
business O
of O
the O
dinner O
- O
table O
so O
tranquilly O
, O
that O
|
     | O
her O
watchful O
companion O
felt O
rejoiced O
, O
though O
a O
little O
surprised O
, O
at O
her O
recovered O
|
     | O
composure O
. O
| 
  | O
Soon O
after O
they O
retired O
from O
table O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
proposed O
a O
walk O
in O
the O
grounds O
, O
and O
as O
they O
wandered O
|
     | O
together O
through O
the O
richly O
- O
scented O
flower O
- O
garden O
, O
and O
then O
seated O
themselves O
where O
the O
cool O
|
     | O
breeze O
of O
evening B-TIME
brought O
the O
tempered O
fragrance O
to O
their O
senses O
more O
delightfully O
still O
, O
the O
|
     | O
feverish O
feeling O
of O
tightness O
across O
her O
forehead O
, O
seemed O
to O
relax O
, O
and O
as O
if O
to O
apologise O
for O
|
     | O
the O
silent O
fit O
that O
had O
seized O
her O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
looked O
kindly O
into O
the O
face O
of O
her O
old O
friend O
, O
and O
|
     | O
then O
bent O
forward O
and O
kissed O
her O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Bless O
you O
, O
my O
dear O
love O
! O
you O
feel O
better O
now O

you O

said O
the O
affectionate O
old O

woman O

" O

" O
It O
was O
too O
much O
for O
you O

scene O

instead O

making O
me O
the O
very O
happiest O

being O
in O
the O
world O
as O
you O
do O
now O

my O
life O

become O
one O

continual O
terror O

can O
do O
no O
good O

yourself O
in O
such O

" O
| 
  | O
Mary B-PERSON
reflected O
for O
a O
moment O
before O
she O
answered O
her O
, O
and O
then O
said O
, O
" O

All O
this O
was O
very O
contrary O
to O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON

judgment O
, O
for O
she O
had O
a O
very O
natural O
dread O

     | O
the O
warm O
heart O
of O
her O
young O
charge O
, O
should O
be O
imposed O
upon O
by O
the O
designing O
and O
depraved O
. O
|
     | O
Nevertheless O
there O
was O
a O
feeling O
of O
respect O
that O
came O
upon O
her O
involuntarily O
, O
and O
as O
it O
were O

     | O
unawares O

the O
firmly O

purpose O
of O
the O
young O
girl O

as O
yet O
she O
could O

hardly O

more O

she O

man O
retired O
in O
silence O

paid O
himself O

the O
truth O

this O
dismal O

A O

     | O
moment O

sufficed O
to O
convince O

nothing O

the O
unnatural O

she O

forth O

Nothing O
could O
exceed O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON

good O
humour O
, O
he O
|
     | O
chatted O
, O

joked O

talked O

taking O
them O
all O
on O
a O
trip O
to O
Paris B-GPE
, O
and O
in O
short O
was O
hardly O

     | O
silent O
for O
a O
single O
moment O
. O
But O
amidst O
all O
this O
communicative O
confidential O
gossip O
, O
he O
never O

     | O
said O
a O

the O

were O
upon O

  | O
Once O
or O
twice O
Martha B-PERSON
began O
to O
say O
something O
intended O
to O
preface O
an O
inquiry O
as O
to O
the O
local O

     | O
destination O
of O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
but O
some O
lively O
sally O
from O
her O
father O
always O
turned O
the O
conversation O
|
     | O
into O
another O
channel O
, O
till O
at O
length O
they O
entered O
the O
gloomy O
region O
of O
Hoxley B-ORG
- O
lane O
  O
after O

     | O
which O
, O
neither O
of O
them O
spoke O
again O
till O
Martha B-PERSON
said O
— O
" O
This O
is O
the O
house O
, O
papa O

— O
But O
I O
believe O

     | O
we O
had O
better O
go O
in O
the O
back O
way O

Shall O
I O
step O
in O
first B-ORDINAL

say O
that O
you O

go O
in O
together O

" O
| 
  | O
Martha B-PERSON
then O
lifted O
the O
latch O
, O
and O
they O
did O
go O
in O
together O
, O
causing O
the O
sick O
woman O
to O
start O
as O
|
     | O
if O
she O
had O
seen O
a O
spectre O

It O
was O
nearly B-DATE
three I-DATE

herself O
in O
the O
overpowering O
presence O
of O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling I-PERSON

and O
the O
belief O
that O
this O
visit O
was O
|
     | O
for O
the O
express O
purpose O
of O
receiving O
her O
thanks O
, O
increased O
the O
embarrassment O
so O
startling O
a O

     | O
condescension O
was O
calculated O
to O
produce O
. O
| 
  | O
Martha B-PERSON
saw O
her O
colour O
change O
from O
pale O
to O
red O
, O
and O
then O
to O
pale O
again O
, O
and O
gently O
approaching O

     | O
her O
, O

the O
poor O

As O
he O
said O
this O

Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
opened O
the O
instrument O

busied O
himself O
in O
unscrewing O

of O

" O

  | O
Martha B-PERSON
looked O
up O
, O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
half I-CARDINAL
afraid O
that O
such O
cautious O
acceptance O
of O
the O
important O

     | O
service O
offered O
, O
might O
offend O
her O
hot O

father O
  O
but O
equally O
to O
her O
surprise O
and O

     | O
satisfaction O
she O
perceived O
that O
his O
countenance O
instead O
of O
expressing O
any O

of O
the O
kind O
, O
|
     | O
wore O
a O
look O
of O
more O

usual O
good O

humour O

he O

Then O
turning O
to O
Martha B-PERSON

one O
|
     | O
waiting O
for O
me O
at O
home O
. O
But O
we O
must O
not O
deceive O
the O
poor O
dear O
woman O
either O
. O
She O
ought O
to O
know O
, O
|
     | O
Martha B-PERSON
that O
this O
is O
a O
chance O
I O
may O
not O
have O
again O
, O
God O
knows O
when O
, O
if O
ever O
. O
Ca O
n't O
you O
explain O
|
     | O
to O
her O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
that O
this O
is O
a O
sort O
of O
thing O
that O
by O
no O
means O
happens O
every B-DATE
day I-DATE
. O
Sometime O
ago O
|
     | O
I O
had O
an O
opportunity O
of O
doing O
this O
gentleman O
a O
good O
turn O
about B-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
of O
his O
principal O
hands O
for O
|
     | O
whom O
he O
was O
greatly O
interested O
— O
for O
he O
is O
like O
a O
father O
to O
them O
all O
, O
and O
he O
promised O
then O
to O
|
     | O
return O
it O
whenever O
I O
had O
any O
thing O
of O
the O
same O
sort O
at O
heart O
. O
So O
now O
, O
I O
have O
written O
to O
him O
|
     | O
about O
this O
boy O
, O
and O
he O
has O
answered O
me O
as O
kind O
as O
possible O
  O
only O
he O
tells O
me O
that O
he O
has O
got O
|
     | O
such O
quantities O
of O
applications O
from O
the O
people O
round O
him O
, O
that O
when O
he O
has O
a O
vacancy O
among O
the O
|
     | O
bound O
hands O
, O
he O
ca O
n't O
keep O
it O
open O
, O
and O
that O
he O
must O
have O
yes O
or O
no O
at O
once O
. O
I O
am O
afraid O
, O
|
     | O
therefore O
, O
that O
we O
must O
give O
it O
up O
, O
my O
dear O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
This O
was O
" O
soft O
soder O
, O
" O
as O
the O
inimitable O
Slick O
calls O
it O
  O
and O
the O
poor O
doubting O
, O
trembling O
, O
|
     | O
helpless O
bit O
of O
human O
nature O
, O
lying O
on O
the O
bed O
from O
whence O
she O
knew O
full O
well O
she O
should O
never O
|
     | O
rise O
, O
did O
not O
listen O
to O
it O
unmoved O
. O
She O
felt O
, O
as O
he O
intended O
she O
should O
, O
her O
heavy O
|
     | O
responsibility O
, O
and O
looked O
up O
into O
the O
face O
of O
Martha B-PERSON
in O
a O
manner O
that O
very O
speakingly O
asked O
|
     | O
for O
counsel O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
good O
girl O
understood O
the O
appeal O
, O
and O
frankly O
answered O
it O
. O
" O
You O
hear O
what O
my O
father O
says O
, O
|
     | O
Mrs. O
Armstrong B-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
leaning O
over O
the O
poor O
invalid O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Yes O
, O
miss O
, O
I O
do O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
anxious O
woman O
, O
" O
and O
, O
God O
help O
me O
! O
— O
I O
feel O
as O
weak O
and O
|
     | O
ignorant O
as O
a O
baby O
about O
what O
I O
ought O
to O
say O
in O
return O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
that O
can O
be O
, O
" O
said O
the O
innocent O
Martha B-PERSON
a O
little O
reproachfully O
. O
" O
You O
know O
|
     | O
exactly O
how O
the O
case O
stands O
, O
and O
must O
certainly O
be O
able O
to O
judge O
what O
you O
think O
it O
right O
to O
do O
|
     | O
under O
these O
circumstances O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
hope O
excuse O
, O
miss O
, O
if O
I O
seem O
over O
mothersome O
and O
foolish O
about O
him O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
poor O
|
     | O
widow O
in O
a O
deprecating O
tone O
, O
" O
but O
he O
's O
a O
precious O
boy O
to O
me O
, O
and O
the O
binding O
him O
, O
comes O
upon O
me O
|
     | O
unawares O
like O
. O
" O
| 
   | O
likely O
she O
would O
be O
unhappy O
if O
we O
persuaded O
her O
, O
let O
it O
turn O
out O
as O
it O
would O
. O
" O
|  
  | O
Instead O
of O
answering O
, O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
suddenly O
wheeled O
round O
, O
and O
looked O
out O
of O
the O
window O
, O
as O
if O
|
     | O
the O
bit O
of O
stony O
mould O
extending O
ten B-QUANTITY
feet I-QUANTITY
deep O
to O
the O
ditch O
that O
fenced O
it O
, O
contained O
something O
|
     | O
of O
peculiar O
interest O
and O
curiosity O
. O
During O
this O
interval O
, O
which O
lasted O
about B-TIME
a I-TIME
minute I-TIME
, O
the O
|
     | O
widow O
Armstrong B-PERSON
again O
fixed O
her O
eyes O
upon O
the O
face O
of O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
with O
an O
appealing O
look O
that O
|
     | O
seemed O
to O
implore O
assistance O
from O
her O
judgment O
, O
while O
it O
evidently O
expressed O
confidence O
in O
her O
|
     | O
kindness O
. O
When O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
again O
permitted O
his O
countenance O
to O
be O
visible O
to O
them O
, O
it O
expressed O
|
     | O
nothing O
but O
indifference O
  O
but O
Martha B-PERSON
thought O
it O
was O
such O
an O
easy O
good O
- O
natured O
sort O
of O
|
     | O
indifference O
that O
there O
could O
be O
no O
danger O
in O
bringing O
him O
back O
to O
the O
subject O
, O
even O
though O
he O
|
     | O
said O
as O
he O
turned O
round O
, O
" O
Come O
, O
my O
dear O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
I O
can O
not O
stay O
another O
moment O
, O
I O
do O
assure O

     | O
you O

" O

  | O
" O
I O
am O
quite O
ready O

" O
she O
replied O
  O
" O
but O
do O
n't O
you O
think O
it O
is O
almost O
a O
pity O
to O
let O
such O

     | O
an O
opportunity O
be O
lost O
for O
poor O
Michael B-PERSON

" O
| 
  | O
" O
Certainly O
it O
is O
, O
my O
dear O

" O
he O
replied O
in O
the O
most O
good O
- O
humoured O
accent O
imaginable O
. O
" O
But O
what O

     | O
would O
you O
have O
me O
do O
, O
my O
dear O
child O
? O
Depend O
upon O
it O
there O
is O
no O
real O
charity O
in O
assisting O

     | O
people O
against O
their O
will O
, O
or O
in O
a O
manner O
in O
any O
way O
contrary O
to O
their O
inclinations O

You O
know O

     | O
perfectly O
well O
, O
that O
it O
was O
my O
real O

sincere O
wish O
that O
this O
good O
woman O

child O
should O
be O

     | O
well O
provided O
for O

An O
opportunity O
for O
doing O
this O

better O
far O
than O
I O
could O
have O
hoped O
for O

is O
|
     | O
now O
proposed O
but O
evidently O
does O
not O
meet O
her O
wishes O

Unfortunately O
I O
must O
send O
the O
answer O
by O
|
     | O
to O
- O
day B-DATE

post O

surely O
you O
would O
not O
recommend O
me O

accept O
this O
situation O
for O
the O
boy O

     | O
excellent O

" O

" O
No O

only O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
Mrs. O

not O
quite O
made O
up O
her O
mind O
about O

I O
thought O
perhaps O

a B-TIME

consideration O
might O
enable O

a O
loss O

would O
be O

at O

a O

an O

     | O
returned O
again O

by O
Parsons O

another O
overlooker O
from O
one B-CARDINAL

" O

said O
Sir O

" O
I O

have O
asked O
two B-CARDINAL

they O
both O
said O
, O
' O

Sir O

as O
he O
spoke O
, O
again O
untied O
the O
paper O

and O
dipping O
a O
pen O
which O
had O
been O
stuck O

     | O
within O
his O
coat O
sleeve O
into O

Martha B-PERSON
received O
the O
paper O
, O

without O
a O
moment O

delay O
, O
laid O
it O
before O

at O

the O

to O
which O
Sir O

had O
pointed O

as O
that O

The O
poor O
woman O
received O
both O
submissively O
  O

after O
a O
moment O

pause O

looked O
up O
once O

Martha B-PERSON

was O
bending O
over O

A O
kind O

encouraging O
smile O
sat O
upon O

expressive O
features O
, O

without O
further O

, O
the O
widow O

Sir O

gaily O
, O
as O
he O
withdrew O
the O
document O
from O
the O

     | O
The O
ready O
servant O
obeyed O
, O

his O
fellow O
- O

followed O
his O
example O
, O
without O
waiting O
for O
any O

" O
Now O

, O

off O

cried O
the O
knight O
, O
moving O
towards O
the O
door O
as O
he O
pocketed O

     | O
the O

But O
stopping O
suddenly O
before O
he O
opened O
it O
he O
said O
, O
" O

the O
way O

you O

may O
take O
the O

clothes O
he O
has O
worn O
at O
the O
lodge O
, O
for O
Sundays B-DATE

but O
of O
course O
they O
would O
not O

suitable O
for O
him O

well O

the O
important O
overlooker O

" O
I O
must O
have O
no O

rejoined O
his O
master O
rather O
sharply O
  O
" O
for O
Mr. O

     | O
Elgood B-PERSON
Sharpton I-PERSON
mentioned O
in O
his O

some O

say O
when O

go O
directly O
into O
the O
town O

Parsons O

buy O
whatever O
you O
think O
the O
boy O
may O
want O
. O
I O
dare O
say O

     | O
this O
will O
be O
very O
nearly O
the O
last O
expense O

Mrs. O

added O

" O
that O

With O
these O

he O
left O
the O

a O
short O

kind O
farewell O

Soon O

him O

again O
passed O
her O

against O

factory O
labourers O
arose O
  O
and O
wherefore O
, O
beyond O
all O
others O
, O
submitted O
to O
the O
|
     | O
sentence O
which O
dooms O
human O
beings O
to O
toil O
, O
these O
people O
should O
appear O
to O
loath O
their O

     | O
employment O
, O
and O
execrate O
, O
as O
it O
should O
seem O
, O
the O
very O
means O
by O
which O
they O
lived O
. O
But O
ere O
her O
|
     | O
lips O
opened O
to O
demand O
the O
explanation O
to O
which O
she O
so O
eagerly O
desired O
to O
listen O
, O
a O
glance O
at O
|
     | O
the O
hard O
features O
of O
the O
wretched O
woman O
checked O
her O
. O
" O
It O
can O
not O
be O
from O
such O
as O
these O
, O
" O
thought O
|
     | O
she O
, O
" O
that O
truth O
and O
instruction O
can O
be O
reasonably O
looked O
for O
" O
— O
and O
as O
she O
silently O
gave O
her O
|
     | O
alms O
, O
and O
moved O
onwards O
towards O
the O
door O
which O
had O
been O
pointed O
to O
, O
as O
that O
of O
the O
widow O
|
     | O
Armstrong B-PERSON
, O
something O
like O
a O
systematic O
project O
for O
making O
herself O
mistress O
of O
the O
knowledge O
she O
|
     | O
wanted O
, O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
suggested O
itself O
to O
her O
imagination O
. O
| 
  | O
Mrs. O
Sykes B-PERSON
eyed O
the O
silver O
largesse O
, O
as O
it O
fell O
into O
her O
hand O
, O
with O
a O
glance O
that O
seemed O
to O
|
     | O
devour O
it O
, O
and O
the O
words O
of O
thanks O
she O
uttered O
were O
almost O
hysterical O
in O
their O
eager O
vehemence O
. O
|
     | O
After O
delaying O
a O
moment O
for O
the O
contemplation O
of O
this O
precious O
" O
drudge O
' O
twixt O
man O
and O
man O
, O
" O
she O
|
     | O
opened O
the O
door O
of O
communication O
, O
and O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
and O
her O
friend O
passed O
into O
the O
|
     | O
dwelling O
- O
room O
of O
the O
widow O
Armstrong B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
Contrary O
to O
custom O
, O
her O
lame O
boy O
, O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
was O
sitting O
on O
the O
side O
of O
her O
bed O
, O
and O
when O
Mary B-PERSON
|
     | O
entered O
, O
he O
was O
holding O
her O
hand O
, O
and O
gazing O
in O
her O
face O
with O
an O
expression O
of O
countenance O
|
     | O
which O
appeared O
to O
both O
the O
intruders O
to O
be O
the O
most O
piteous O
they O
had O
ever O
looked O
upon O
. O
The O
poor O
|
     | O
child O
was O
looking O
, O
too O
, O
most O
wretchedly O
ill O
, O
and O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
idea O
which O
suggested O
itself O
was O
, O
|
     | O
that O
he O
felt O
himself O
to O
be O
dying O
. O
| 
  | O
Notwithstanding O
the O
extreme O
poverty O
of O
the O
widow O
Armstrong B-PERSON
, O
there O
was O
an O
air O
of O
decency O
and O
|
     | O
decorum O
about O
her O
, O
that O
might O
in O
any O
situation O
have O
commanded O
respect O
  O
but O
when O
contrasted O
with O
|
     | O
the O
appearance O
of O
her O
neighbour O
, O
seemed O
to O
indicate O
a O
claim O
to O
more O
observance O
than O
her O
|
     | O
visiters O
were O
showing O
by O
this O
sudden O
and O
uninvited O
entrance O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
beg O
your O
pardon O
, O
Mrs. O
Armstrong B-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
gently O
, O
" O
for O
breaking O
in O
upon O
you O
so O

     | O
abruptly O
  O
and O
I O
fear O
our O
doing O
so O
may O
have O
startled O
your O
sick O
child O
. O
— O
This O
little O
fellow O
is O

     | O
very O
ill O
, O
I O
fear O

" O

" O
It O
is O
long O
since O
he O
has O
known O

ma'am O

" O
replied O
the O
widow O
  O
" O
but O
it O
is O
not O
that O
which O

     | O
makes O
him O
look O
so O
white O
and O
trembling O
now O
. O
We O
have O
lost O
what O
was O
dearer O

us O
both O
than O
all O
the O

I O
do O

up O
again O

  | O
" O
What O
, O
then O
, O
has O
happened O
to O
you O

" O
said O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
with O
much O
interest O
— O
" O
Nothing O
bad O
to O
your O
son O

  | O
" O
You O

said O
the O
poor O
woman O
, O
anxiously O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
have O
seen O
him O
at O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling I-PERSON

, O
" O
she O
replied O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
wish O
you O
never O
had O
, O
ma'am O

" O
rejoined O
the O
widow O
, O
bitterly O
— O
" O
We O
were O
only O
starving O
before O
, O

now O
we O
are O
worse O
than O

" O
Do O
explain O
to O
me O
what O
you O
mean O

Mrs. O

, O
" O
said O
Mary B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
ought O
to O
do O
it O
, O
ma'am O
, O
for O
you O
speak O
kindly O
  O
and O
that O
's O
a O
claim O
poor O
folks O
can O
seldom O

     | O
withstand O
. O
— O
But O
how O
can O
I O
tell O
you O
the O
matter O
, O
ma'am O
? O
I O
know O
nothing O

that O
's O
the O
reason O

     | O
why O
poor O
Edward B-PERSON

I O
are O
so O
miserable O
. O
" O

" O

that O
is O
a O
bad O
way O
to O
get O
into O
, O
my O
good O
Mrs. O
Armstrong B-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
cheerfully O
. O
" O
Do O

     | O
fret O
yourself O
about O

do O
not O

Little O
Edward B-PERSON
here O
should O
know O

better O

" O

  | O
The O
pale O
, O
brokenhearted O
boy O
looked O
at O
her O
with O
lack O

lustre O
eyes O

said O
nothing O

" O
Are O
you O
uneasy O

down O

resumed O
Miss O

     | O
Brotherton B-PERSON

" O

he O
was O
carried O
away O
from O

" O
replied O
the O
widow O
, O
with O
a O
|
     | O
sob O
, O
that O
seemed O
the O
result O
of O
strength O
exhausted O
, O
and O
weakness O
that O
could O
struggle O
no O

     | O
longer O
. O

  | O
" O
Carried O
away O

cried O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
changing O
colour O
. O
" O

do O
you O
mean O
, O
Mrs. O
Armstrong B-PERSON

" O
Sir O

Dowling I-PERSON
, O
ma'am O

has O
had O
him O
taken O
away O

another O
sob O
followed O
the O
words O
. O

" O
Do O
not O

I O
torment O
you O
thus O
from O
idle O
curiosity O

pursued O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
bending O
over O
her O
  O
" O

I O

     | O
entreat O
you O
to O
explain O
to O
me O
fully O
what O
you O

greatly O
interested O

" O
I O

you O

it O

returned O
the O
poor O
mother O
, O
mournfully O
  O
" O

I O
can O
tell O
little O

any O
grand O
lady O

the O
friend O

the O

     | O
parting O
with O
him O
without O
one B-CARDINAL
blessing O
, O
or O
one B-CARDINAL
kiss O
, O
is O
hard O
to O
bear O

justly O

am O
no O
particular O
friend O

replied O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
with O
an O
accent O
which O

     | O
perhaps O
spoke O
more O

her O
words O

I O

will O
tell O

the O
lame O
boy O

coming O
round O
the O
bed O

to O
the O
place O

she O
was O
standing O

looking O
into O
her O
face O

all O

gazing O

deep O
feeling O
at O

beautiful O

     | O
countenance O

I O

him O
there O
more O

Edward B-PERSON

I O
am O
quite O
sure O
he O

dressed O
so O
fine O

" O
He O
was O
more O
unhappy O
ten B-CARDINAL
times O
over O

Edward B-PERSON

" O
than O

unkindly O

tears O

repeated O
her O
request O
, O
that O
she O
might O
be O
told O
what O
it O
|
     | O
was O
that O
had O
happened O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
widow O
then O
related O
more O
succinctly O
than O
might O
have O
been O
expected O
, O
all O
that O
had O
passed O
|
     | O
between O
herself O
, O
her O
boy O
, O
and O
Miss O
Martha B-PERSON
Dowling I-PERSON
, O
on O
the B-TIME
morning I-TIME
which O
followed O
the O
theatrical O
|
     | O
representation O
at O
Dowling B-FAC
Lodge I-FAC
. O
And O
before O
she O
proceeded O
further O
, O
Edward B-PERSON
bore I-PERSON
testimony O
to O
the O
|
     | O
spirited O
and O
courageous O
willingness O
with O
which O
his O
brother O
had O
adopted O
the O
proposed O
scheme O
. O
He O
|
     | O
had O
, O
it O
seemed O
, O
as O
usual O
, O
watched O
Teddy B-PERSON
's O
return O
from O
the O
factory O
— O
told O
him O
what O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
|
     | O
proposed O
doing O
for O
him O
, O
and O
declared O
, O
that O
hard O
as O
it O
would O
be O
to O
part O
with O
him O
and O
" O
mother O
, O
" O
|
     | O
he O
was O
ready O
and O
willing O
to O
start O
, O
and O
was O
quite O
determined O
to O
be O
the O
best O
boy O
that O
ever O
was O
|
     | O
' O
prenticed O
, O
and O
to O
be O
workman O
enough O
to O
maintain O
them O
both O
as O
soon O
as O
his O
time O
was O
out O
. O
| 
  | O
Here O
the O
widow O
again O
resumed O
her O
narrative O
, O
and O
related O
very O
accurately O
the O
scene O
of O
the O
|
     | O
following O
morning O
  O
dwelling O
much O
on O
the O
young O
lady O
's O
kind O
manner O
, O
and O
on O
her O
own O
putting O
it O
to O
|
     | O
her O
whether O
she O
advised O
that O
the O
child O
should O
go O
, O
or O
not O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
And O
Martha B-PERSON
Dowling I-PERSON
counselled O
you O
to O
let O
him O
go O
? O
" O
demanded O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Yes O
, O
again O
and O
again O
, O
she O
did O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
poor O
mother O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
You O
are O
quite O
sure O
it O
was O
Miss O
Martha B-PERSON
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Oh O
, O
yes O
! O
ma'am O
  O
my O
Mike B-PERSON
took O
care O
to O
make O
me O
understand O
that O
, O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
they O
came O
|
     | O
together O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Then O
be O
quite O
easy O
in O
your O
mind O
, O
Mrs. O
Armstrong B-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
eagerly O
. O
" O
I O
have O
no O
great O
|
     | O
liking O
for O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling I-PERSON
. O
I O
do O
not O
think O
well O
of O
him O
, O
nor O
have O
I O
much O
to O
say O
in O
favour O
of O

     | O
any O
of O
his O
family O

They O
seem O
to O
me O
to O
be O
cold O
- O
hearted O
, O
selfish O
people O
. O
But O
for O
this O
one O
, O
this O
|
     | O
Miss O
Martha B-PERSON
that O
you O
speak O
of O
, O
I O
will O
undertake O
to O
answer O
for O
it O
that O
she O
has O
never O
deceived O

     | O
you O
, O
and O
that O
if O
she O
advised O
you O
to O
let O
Michael B-PERSON
go O
, O
it O
was O
because O
she O
thought O
the O
doing O
so O

     | O
would O
be O
advantageous O
for O
him O

" O

   | O
truth O
, O
ma'am O
, O
in O
your O
voice O
, O
and O
in O
your O
eyes O
. O
Do O
as O
I O
do O
, O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
dear O
! O
look O
at O
|
     | O
the O
kind O
face O
of O
this O
young O
lady O
, O
and O
see O
if O
you O
ca O
n't O
find O
comfort O
from O
what O
she O
says O
? O
I O
did O

     | O
think O
, O
myself O
, O
ignorant O
as O
I O
am O
, O
that O
the O
young O
lady O
had O
an O
honest O
face O

, O
oh O
! O
ma'am O
, O
let O
it O

     | O
be O
as O
it O
will O

make O
the O
very O
best O
of O
it O
, O
' O
tis O
cruel O
to O
have O
our O
darling O
taken O
away O
in O
this O

     | O
fashion O
, O
without O
one O
word O
of O

leave O
and O
blessing O

" O
|  
  | O
" O
Indeed O
it O
is O
! O
" O
replied O
Mary B-PERSON
  O
" O
and O
your O
being O
ignorant O
of O
the O
place O
of O
his O
destination O

     | O
increases O
this O
anxiety O

But O
on O
this O
point O
, O
at O
least O
, O
I O
think O
I O
shall O
be O
able O
to O
set O
your O
mind O

at O
rest O

Before O
this O
time O

shall O

Keep O
up O

this O
little O

here O
look O

Astonishment O
very O
literally O
rendered O
the O
widow O
Armstrong B-PERSON
dumb O
, O
on O
hearing O
this O
most O
|
     | O
extraordinary O
proposal O
. O
Poor O
soul O
! O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
short I-DATE
days I-DATE
ago I-DATE
it O
would O
have O
been O
sufficient O
to O
make O
|
     | O
her O
forget O
her O
weakness O
and O
her O
want O
, O
and O
have O
put O
her O
in O
a O
state O
of O
mind O
that O
queens O
might O
|
     | O
envy O
  O
for O
she O
would O
hardly O
have O
been O
able O
to O
remember O
that O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
have O
another O

     | O
wish O
  O
but O
now O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
use O
she O
made O
on O
recovering O
her O
speech O
, O
was O
to O
exclaim O
, O
" O
Oh O
! O
Michael B-PERSON
! O

     | O
Michael B-PERSON

why O

you O
by O
to O
hear O
this O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
He O
shall O
hear O
it O
, O
Mrs. O
Armstrong B-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
voice O
of O
such O
cheerful O
confidence O
, O
that O
|
     | O
the O
terrors O
of O
both O
mother O
and O
son O
seemed O
to O
vanish O
before O
it O
. O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
, O
too O
, O
ventured O
to O
|
     | O
add O
an O
encouraging O
commentary O
upon O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
promised O
visit O
of O
inquiry O
at O
the O
Lodge B-FAC
, O
observing O
, O
|
     | O
that O
it O
was O
altogether O
out O
of O
probability O
that O
they O
should O
want O
to O
make O
any O
mystery O
as O
to O
where O
|
     | O
the O
little O
fellow O
was O
gone O
. O
| 
  | O
Mrs. O
Armstrong B-PERSON
, O
as O
she O
listened O
, O
seemed O
almost O
too O
happy O
to O
credit O
the O
evidence O
of O
her O
own O
|
     | O
senses O
  O
but O
in O
the O
deep O
- O
set O
melancholy O
eye O
of O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
there O
was O
still O
an O
expression O
of O
|
     | O
suffering O
and O
of O
fear O
that O
looked O
as O
if O
misery O
had O
taken O
a O
hold O
upon O
him O
that O
could O
not O
be O
|
     | O
relinquished O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Now O
I O
must O
go O
! O
" O
said O
the O
young O
lady O
, O
rising O
, O
" O
or O
I O
shall O
hardly O
have O
time O
to O
keep O
my O
|
     | O
promise O
. O
But O
I O
must O
settle O
with O
you O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
my O
dear O
boy O
. O
What O
was O
the O
amount O
of O
your O
wages O
by O
|
     | O
the B-DATE
month I-DATE
? O
" O
| 
   | O
child O
himself O
, O
she O
could O
not O
see O
, O
but O
his O
whole O
frame O
trembled O
, O
and O
they O
fancied O
|
     | O
he O
was O
shedding O
tears O
. O
|  
  | O
" O
God O
bless O
you O
both O
! O
" O
she O
said O
, O
" O
to O
- O
morrow B-DATE
you O
shall O
see O
me O
again O

" O
And O
so O
saying O
she O
took O
|
     | O
the O
arm O
of O
her O
friend O
, O
and O
again O
passed O
through O
the O
dwelling O
- O
room O
of O
Mrs. O
Sykes B-PERSON
. O
The O
woman O
had O
|
     | O
now O
three B-CARDINAL
little O
dirty O
creatures O
round O
her O
, O
to O
whom O
she O
was O
giving O
bread O

" O
Heaven O
keep O
you O
, O
ma'am O
! O
This O
is O
your O
treat O

" O
she O
said O
, O
as O
Mary B-PERSON
and O
her O
friend O
passed O
|
     | O
through O
, O
" O
It O
is O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
for O
many B-DATE

" O
| 
  | O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
's O
heart O
was O
too O
full O
to O
answer O
— O
she O
nodded O
her O
head O
and O
passed O
on O
. O
Their O

     | O
homeward O

up O
Hoxley B-ORG
- O
lane O

across O
the O

along O
a O
pretty O
shaded O
bridle O

that O
led O
to O
a O
gate O
in O
her O
own O
park O
- O
paling O

was O
performed O
almost O
entirely O
in O
silence O

There O
is O
a O

     | O
state O
of O
mind O
in O
which O
ideas O
come O
with O
too O
much O
violence O
and O
rapidity O
to O
be O
told O
off O
in O
words O
. O

     | O
When O
this O
happens O
from O
an O
excess O
of O
happy O
imaginings O
, O
no O
condition O
can O
be O
more O
delightful O

     | O
when O
, O
as O
in O
the O
present O

it O
arises O
from O
the O
remembrance O

painful O

it O
is O

     | O
greatly O
the O
reverse O

The O
misery O
around O
her O
was O
no O
longer O
a O
matter O
of O
doubtful O
speculation O
, O
but O

     | O
of O
most O

certainty O

Neither O

it O
any O

little O
Edward B-PERSON

drove O

him O

up O
his O
sickly O

ceaseless O

each O
long O

She O
felt O
oppressed O

overwhelmed O

almost O
hopeless O

at O
that O
time O

might O
be O

found O
. O

  | O
She O
inquired O
for O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
and O
was O
shown O
as O
usual O
into O
my O
lady O
's O
morning B-TIME
drawing O
- O
room O
, O
where O
to O

     | O
her O
extreme O
annoyance O
she O
found O
her O
ladyship O
, O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
, O
Lady O
Clarissa B-PERSON
Shrimpton I-PERSON
, O
and O
Miss O

     | O
Mogg O
. O
| 
   | O
of O
unquestionable O
notoriety O
to O
the O
whole O
neighbourhood O
. O
But O
if O
his O
reception O
was O
|
     | O
cold O
, O
that O
of O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa I-PERSON
was O
warm O
, O
for O
she O
actually O
threw O
her O
arms O
round O
the O
young O
lady O
, O
|
     | O
reproaching O
her O
at O
the O
same O
time O
very O
tenderly O
for O
not O
having O
sent O
to O
say O
she O
was O
going O
to O

     | O
drive O
to O
Dowling B-FAC
Lodge I-FAC
. O
" O
I O
should O
have O
liked O
your O
carriage O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
so O
much O
better O
than O
my O
|
     | O
broiling O
little O
phaeton O
! O
" O
|  
  | O
It O
was O
hardly O
possible O
at O
that O
moment O
, O
that O
either O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
persons O
present O
could O
have O
|
     | O
said O
any O
thing O
to O
her O
sufficiently O
interesting O
to O
fully O
awaken O
her O
sense O
of O
hearing O
  O
unless O
, O
|
     | O
indeed O
, O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
had O
led O
the O
conversation O
to O
Michael B-PERSON
Armstrong I-PERSON
. O
But O
this O
he O
did O
not O
do O
  O
and O
, O
|
     | O
therefore O
, O
having O
endured O
Lady O
Clarissa B-PERSON
's O
embrace O
, O
and O
answered O
her O
mechanically O
, O
she O
knew O
not O
|
     | O
what O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
walked O
up O
to O
the O
sofa O
where O
the O
lady O
of O
the O
mansion O
as O
usual O
sat O
|
     | O
enthroned O
, O
and O
said O
, O
" O
Will O
you O
be O
so O
good O
, O
ma'am O
, O
as O
to O
let O
Miss O
Martha B-PERSON
be O
told O
that O
I O
am O
come O
|
     | O
to O
call O
upon O
her O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
The O
surprised O
eyebrows O
with O
which O
her O
ladyship O
listened O
to O
this O
speech O
would O
, O
probably O
, O
under O
|
     | O
other O
circumstances O
, O
have O
given O
birth O
to O
an O
exceedingly O
comical O
caricature O
, O
but O
at O
this O
moment O
|
     | O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton I-PERSON
had O
no O
fun O
in O
her O
thoughts O
, O
and O
not O
immediately O
receiving O
an O
answer O
, O
she O
said O
, O
|
     | O
loud O
enough O
for O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
to O
hear O
, O
" O
Will O
you O
give O
me O
leave O
to O
ring O
the O
bell O
, O
and O
ask O
for O
the O
|
     | O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
Miss O
Martha B-PERSON
? O
" O
| 
  | O
Lady B-PERSON
Dowling I-PERSON
still O
remained O
silently O
staring O
at O
her O
  O
but O
not O
so O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
. O
He O
reached O
the O
|
     | O
bell O
almost O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
young O
lady O
herself O
, O
and O
fully O
persuaded O
that O
this O
most O
unaccountable O
|
     | O
request O
could O
only O
proceed O
from O
some O
little O
manoeuvring O
project O
at O
that O
moment O
labouring O
in O
the O
|
     | O
fair O
Brotherton B-PERSON
's O
head O
, O
which O
had O
, O
somehow O
or O
other O
, O
his O
son O
Augustus B-PERSON
for O
its O
object O
, O
his O
|
     | O
countenance O
resumed O
all O
its O
former O
affectionate O
urbanity O
towards O
her O
, O
and O
taking O
her O
hand O
too O
|
     | O
suddenly O
for O
any O
contrivance O
to O
prevent O
it O
, O
he O
said O
— O
" O
Martha B-PERSON
? O
... O
Do O
you O
want O
to O
see O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
|
     | O
my O
dear O
? O
— O
To O
be O
sure O
you O
shall O
. O
She O
is O
a O
Dowling B-PERSON
, O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
, O
though O
not O
quite O
like O
the O

     | O
rest O
of O
us O
. O
But O
where O
is O
the O
Dowling B-PERSON
, O
young O
or O
old O
, O
male O
or O
female O
, O
who O
would O
not O
fly O
from O
the O

     | O
farthest O
corner O
of O
the O
world O
to O
see O
you O
? O
" O

  | O
" O
I O
only O
want O
to O
see O
Miss O
Martha B-PERSON
just O
now O
, O
sir O
, O
" O
replied O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
half B-CARDINAL
smiling O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
And O
Martha B-PERSON
you O
shall O
see O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
without O
a O
moment O

delay O
. O
Desire O
Miss O
Martha B-PERSON
Dowling I-PERSON
to O
|
     | O
come O
here O
instantly O
! O
" O
he O
continued O
, O
as O
the O
door O
opened O
, O
and O
a O
servant O
appeared O
at O
it O
— O
adding O
, O
|
     | O
when O
the O
door O
closed O
again O
, O
" O
You O
do O
her O
an O
honour O
, O
my O
dear O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
, O
in O
thus O
asking O
for O
|
     | O
her O
, O
that O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
of O
her O
family O
, O
perhaps O
, O
might O
feel O
inclined O
to O
envy O
. O
" O
But O
as O
Miss B-PERSON
|
     | I-PERSON
Brotherton I-PERSON
made O
no O
answer O
at O
all O
, O
and O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa I-PERSON
began O
to O
hem O
, O
and O
fidget O
, O
and O
walk O
towards O
|
     | O
the O
window O
, O
all O
which O
the O
observant O
knight O
well O
knew O
were O
pretty O
lures O
, O
meant O
to O
recal O
him O
, O
he O
|
     | O
contented O
himself O
with O
gallantly O
drawing O
forward O
an O
arm O
- O
chair O
for O
the O
heiress O
, O
at O
no O
great O
|
     | O
distance O
from O
Lady B-PERSON
Dowling I-PERSON
, O
and O
then O
strode O
across O
the O
apartment O
to O
sooth O
the O
irritation O
of O
his O
|
     | O
noble O
friend O
. O
| 
   | O
unanswered O
. O
The O
message O
had O
been O
delivered O
to O
her O
in O
his O
name O
, O
and O
she O
entered O
|
     | O
almost O
immediately O
. O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
in O
no O
humour O
to O
make O
small O
talk O
for O
her O
ladyship O
, O
|
     | O
instantly O
rose O
, O
and O
went O
forward O
to O
meet O
her O
. O
" O
I O
took O
the O
liberty O
of O
sending O
for O
you O
, O
my O
dear O

Miss O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
" O
she O
said O
, O
" O
to O
request O
you O
would O
let O
me O
speak O
to O
you O
alone O
, O
for O
five B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
. O
— O

     | O
Will O
you O
take O
a O
parasol O
, O
and O
let O
us O
walk O
into O
the O
shrubbery O
together O
? O
" O
|  
  | O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
who O
certainly O
liked O
Miss B-PERSON
Brotherton I-PERSON
, O
notwithstanding O
the O
late O
painful O
scene O
, O
produced O
|
     | O
by O
her O
indiscretion O
, O
and O
who O
, O
moreover O
, O
at O
this O
moment O
, O
joyfully O
recollected O
how O
charming O
an O
|
     | O
anecdote O
she O
had O
now O
to O
relate O
concerning O
her O
father O
, O
acquiesced O
in O
this O
proposal O
with O
a O
ready O
|
     | O
smile O
, O
and O
saying O
that O
her O
parasol O
was O
always O
in O
the O
hall O
, O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
young O
ladies O
left O
the O
room O
|
     | O
together O
. O
| 
  | O
No O
sooner O
did O
she O
find O
herself O
beneath O
the O
sheltering O
trees O
of O
the O
extensive O
shrubbery O
, O
and O
|
     | O
ascertained O
, O
by O
looking O
round O
, O
that O
they O
were O
really O
alone O
, O
than O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
, O
passing O
her O
|
     | O
arm O
through O
that O
of O
her O
companion O
, O
said O
, O
" O
My O
dear O
Miss O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
I O
can O
not O
help O
feeling O
great O
|
     | O
interest O
in O
the O
welfare O
of O
the O
little O
boy O
whom O
we O
saw O
performing O
the B-TIME
other I-TIME
night I-TIME
— O
little O
|
     | O
Michael B-PERSON
Armstrong I-PERSON
, O
I O
mean O
. O
Will O
you O
have O
the O
kindness O
to O
tell O
me O
where O
he O
is O
now O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
Instead O
of O
giving O
a O
direct O
answer O
, O
Martha B-PERSON
eagerly O
exclaimed O
, O
" O
I O
am O
so O
glad O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
, O
|
     | O
that O
you O
asked O
to O
see O
me O
, O
for O
I O
have O
quite O
longed O
to O
tell O
you O
all O
particulars O
about O
that O
little O
|
     | O
fellow O
— O
and O
all O
that O
papa O
has O
been O
doing O
for O
him O
. O
I O
do O
assure O
you O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
, O
that O
|
     | O
notwithstanding O
what O
you O
saw O
the B-TIME
other I-TIME
night I-TIME
, O
papa O
has O
been O
, O
and O
still O
is O
, O
most O
excessively O
|
     | O
kind O
to O
him O
. O
Only O
he O
was O
very O
troublesome O
about O
the O
acting O
, O
and O
papa O
's O
temper O
is O
hasty O
. O
|
        | O
That O
|  | O
, O
as O
you O
must O
be O
aware O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
, O
is O
the O
case O
with O
many O
people O
  O
but O
there O
|
     | O
are O
very O
few O
who O
have O
courage O
and O
candour O
to O
own O
it O
, O
as O
my O
father O
does O
. O
In O
justice O
to O
him O
, O
I O
|
     | O
must O
tell O
you O
what O
happened O
the B-TIME
morning I-TIME
after O
the O
unfortunate O
play O
. O
My O
father O
sent O
for O
me O
, O
and O
|
     | O
said O
, O
that O
he O
was O
perfectly O
miserable O
in O
his O
mind O
on O
account O
of O
the O
anger O
he O
had O
shown O
towards O
|
     | O
Michael B-PERSON
. O
He O
told O
me O
, O
as O
frankly O
as O
possible O
, O
that O
he O
had O
beat O
him O
, O
and O
that O
in O
consequence O
of O
|
     | O
this O
, O
the O
boy O
was O
evidently O
so O
afraid O
of O
him O
that O
he O
had O
no O
enjoyment O
when O
in O
his O
presence O
. O
And O
|
     | O
he O
went O
on O
to O
say O
that O
such O
being O
the O
case O
, O
he O
was O
determined O
to O
apprentice O
the O
child O
to O
a O
good O
|
     | O
trade O
, O
where O
he O
might O
learn O
to O
maintain O
himself O
comfortably O
, O
and O
assist O
his O
family O
besides O
. O
So O
|
     | O
you O
see O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
, O
" O
concluded O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
in O
an O
eager O
voice O
, O
and O
with O
heightened O
colour O
, O
|
     | O
" O
you O
see O
that O
if O
papa O
loses O
his O
temper O
, O
he O
knows O
how O
to O
atone O
for O
it O
. O
" O
| 
   | O
little O
fellow O
. O
And O
now O
I O
hope O
you O
will O
tell O
me O
also O
to O
what O
part O
of O
the O
country O
|
     | O
he O
has O
been O
sent O
. O
" O
|  
  | O
" O
I O
would O
tell O
you O
in O
a O
moment O
, O
if O
I O
knew O
, O
my O
dear O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
, O
but O
I O
do O
not O
. O
His O
|
     | O
departure O
at O
last O
was O
very O
sudden O
  O
owing O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
to O
papa O
's O
having O
found O
some O
particularly O
|
     | O
good O
opportunity O
of O
sending O
him O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
wonder O
you O
should O
never O
have O
asked O
where O
he O
was O
sent O
to O
, O
Miss O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
|
     | O
gravely O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
did O
ask O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
, O
" O
replied O
Martha B-PERSON
  O
" O
but O
papa O
said O
he O
could O
not O

     | O
after O

immediately O
turning O

the O

she O

entered O
the O

followed O

by O

They O
found O

you O

possession O

The O

That O
this O

far O
away O
from O
Dowling B-FAC

would O
have O
been O

but O
for O
the O
dreaded O
parting O
with O
his O

     | O
mother O

, O
a O
source O

distant O
hopes O

might O
have O
been O
read O
in O
the O
contented O
meditation O

     | O
of O
his O
eye O
, O
as O
he O
rode O
silently O
along O
in O

of O
his O
jocose O
companions O

who O
amused O
themselves O

in O
talking O

judicious O

     | O

At O
length O
the O
carriage O
reached O
the O
point O
at O
which O
Sir O

intended O
his O
airing O
should O

     | O
terminate O

he O
looked O
out O
to O
reconnoitre O
the O
opening O
of O
a O
lane O
to O
the O
left O
where O
he O
expected O

covered O
cart O

Nor O
was O
he O
disappointed O

covered O
cart O
, O
with O
an O
excellent O
stout O
horse O

     | O
in O
it O
, O
was O
drawn O
up O
close O

take O
advantage O
of O
the O
shade O
of O
a O

As O

the O
occupant O

peeped O
out O

The O
well O

known O
figure O

greeted O
him O

his O
feet O
touched O
the O
turf O

the O
next O
instant O

felt O

plaintive O

he O

you O

burning O

     | O
That O
its O

wiped O

table O

it O

Mr. O

took O
his O
place O

great O
man O

to O

looked O
neither O
to O
the O
right O
nor O

     | O
to O
the O
left O
, O

made O
himself O
comfortable O
without O
taking O
the O
trouble O
of O
considering O
whether O
any O

     | O
other O
person O
were O
present O
, O

not O

Michael B-PERSON
crept O
in O
after O
him O
, O

when O
the O
more O
important O
part O

     | O
of O
the O
company O
had O
arranged O
themselves O
, O

was O
observed O
standing O
alone O

the O
most O
distant O
part O

of O
the O
room O

" O
What O
dost O
stand O
shivering O
there O
for O
, O
my O
boy O

" O
said O
the O
old O
farmer O
, O
in O
north O

country O
dialect O
, O

     | O
so O
broad O
as O
to O
be O
dangerous O
for O
south O

country O
folks O
to O
spell O
, O
" O
I O
could O
be O
after O
thinking O
there O

     | O
was O
some O
mistake O
here O

Surely O
you O
ought O
not O

some O
other O
folks O
are O

     | O
sitting O

This O
observation O

though O
the O
genuine O
result O
of O
the O
old O
man O

notions O
of O
vulgar O

the O

     | O
reverse O
, O
might O
not O
have O
been O
so O
bluntly O
spoken O
, O
had O
he O
not O
felt O
himself O
affronted O

unceremonious O
style O
in O
which O
his O
place O

been O
taken O
from O
him O

Michael B-PERSON

     | O
probably O
did O
not O
understand O
the O
full O
meaning O
of O
the O
remark O
, O
nevertheless O
he O
looked O
dreadfully O

     | O
terrified O
, O
and O
fixed O
his O
eyes O
upon O
the O
back O
part O

the O

From O
this O

no O

expressed O
about O

, O

what O
good O
was O
there O
in O
asking O
any O

So O
a O
thick O
slice O
of O
bread O

     | O

a O
scrap O
of O

he O

and O

     | O
preceded O
by O
Dame B-PERSON
Pritchard I-PERSON

a O
candle O
, O
conducted O
him O
to O
a O
pallet O

in O
the O

chamber O
as O

For O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
moment O
after O
he O
was O
left O
alone O
with O
the O
boy O
, O
the O
superintendent O
felt O
a O
strong O

     | O
inclination O
to O
make O
him O
pay O
for O
the O
affronts O

had O
been O
the O
cause O
of O
his O

But O

     | O
the O
same O
wisdom O
which O
had O
cut O
short O
his O
indignation O
there O

checked O
him O
now O
  O

having O
locked O

     | O
the O
chamber O

, O
and O
given O
Michael B-PERSON
a O
stimulating O
kick O
to O
hasten O
his O
undressing O
, O
he O
carefully O
|
     | O
packed O
in O
a O
bundle O
the O
Dowling B-FAC
Lodge I-FAC
suit O
which O
he O
took O
off O
, O
leaving O
in O
its O

the O
result O

his O
hasty O

When O

slumbers O
at O
day O
- O
break O
the O
following O
morning O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
found O
these O
new O

     | O
garments O
ready O
for O
him O
, O
and O
for O
a O
moment O
his O
heart O
sunk O
at O
the O
change O
, O
for O
though O
new O
, O
they O
|
     | O
were O
of O
the O
very O
lowest O
kind O
, O
and O
formed O
as O
strong O
a O
contrast O
as O
was O
well O
possible O
with O
the O

     | O
dress O
he O
had O
laid O
aside O
on O
preparing O
for O
his O
night B-TIME

. O
But O
the O
human O
mind O
will O
often O
show O

     | O
symptoms O
of O
philosophy O
even O
at O
ten B-DATE
years I-DATE
old I-DATE
  O
which O
truth O
was O
made O
evident O
by O
the O
manner O
in O

     | O
which O
the O
young O
apprentice O
invested O
himself O
in O
his O
new O
suit O
, O
cheering O
his O
spirit O
as O
he O
did O
so O
, O

     | O
with O
the O
recollection O
that O

going O
to O

bound O
to O
a O
trade O
like O
that O
of O
stocking O

weaving O
, O
|
     | O
would O
look O
very O
ridiculous O
in O
such O
a O
dress O
as O
had O
been O
just O
taken O
away O
from O
him O
. O

Early O
as O
it O
was O
, O
Mrs. O

was O
ready O
in O

with O

for O
Mr. O

Parsons B-PERSON

Michael B-PERSON
received O
a O
fitting O

the O

up O

and O
the O
ill O

matched O
pair O
set O
off O
again O
upon O
their O
journey O
. O
| 
  | O
It O
might O
seem O
paradoxical O
to O
say O
, O
that O
the O
temper O
of O
Mr. O
Parsons B-PERSON
was O
irritated O
by O
the O

     | O
patient O
, O
unsuspicious O
, O
and O
submissive O
demeanour O
of O
his O
helpless O
charge O
  O
yet O
such O
, O
nevertheless O
, O

     | O
was O
the O
fact O

was O
many O
years O
since O
the O

equally O
unwonted O

     | O
disagreeable O
  O
and O
now O
that O
the O
peaceable O
demeanour O
of O
his O
little O
companion O
had O
convinced O
him O

     | O
that O
it O
was O
altogether O
unnecessary O
, O
he O
felt O
ready O

twist O
his O
neck O
round O
, O
as O
an O
atonement O
for O

Ere O
they O
had O
advanced O
a B-QUANTITY

further O
, O
however O
, O
his O
spirit O
found O
a O
species O
of O
consolation O

     | O
was O
perfectly O
congenial O

reach O
through O

the B-TIME

was O
just O
such O
a O

as O

     | O
his O
heart O
desired O
for O
the O
dwelling O

who O
had O
caused O

that O
Mr. O

drove O
slowly O

cautiously O
onward O

looked O
out O

upon O
the O
bleak O
desolation O
of O
the O

with O
a O
feeling O
that O
almost O
approached O
to O

     | O
complacency O
. O
| 
  | O
At O
length O
the O

was O
passed O
, O
and O
for O
a B-QUANTITY

enjoyed O
the O

of O
a O

The O
country O
too O

seemed O
softening O
into O
a O
species O

wild O
beauty O
, O
that O
might O

in O

some O

atone O

work O
of O
man O
. O
A O
wide O
spreading O
cotton O
- O
factory O
here O
rears O
its O
unsightly O
|
     | O
form O
, O
and O
at O
one B-CARDINAL
glance O
makes O
the O
happy O
wanderer O
whose O
foot O
is O
free O
to O
turn O
which O
way O
he O
will O
, O
|
     | O
feel O
how O
precious O
is O
the O
power O
of O
retracing O
his O
steps O
back O
again O
along O
the O
beguiling O
path O
that O
|
     | O
has O
led O
him O
to O
it O
. O
| 
  | O
This O
was O
a O
joy O
for O
which O
our O
little O
Michael B-PERSON
sighed O
in O
vain O
. O
On O
jogged O
the O
cart O
, O
and O
nearer O
it O
|
     | O
came O
at O
every O
jolt O
to O
the O
object O
which O
he O
most O
hated O
to O
look O
upon O
. O
But O
then O
came O
also O
the O
|
     | O
cheering O
thought O
, O
that O
he O
was O
no O
longer O
a O
mere O
factory O
boy O
, O
but O
about O
to O
become O
an O
apprentice O
|
     | O
to O
a O
good O
and O
profitable O
trade O
, O
in O
which O
hereafter O
he O
might O
expect O
to O
get O
money O
enough O
for O
|
     | O
himself O
, O
for O
mother O
, O
and O
Teddy B-PERSON
too O
! O
Nevertheless O
, O
he O
certainly O
did O
wish O
, O
at O
the O
very O
bottom O
of O
|
     | O
his O
heart O
, O
that O
the O
stocking O
- O
weaving O
business O
was O
not O
carried O
on O
in O
a O
building O
so O
very O
like O
a O
|
     | O
cotton O
factory O
! O
But O
though O
Michael B-PERSON
saw O
this O
hated O
cotton O
factory O
, O
he O
as O
yet O
saw O
but O
a O
small O
|
     | O
portion O
of O
the O
horrors O
which O
belonged O
to O
the O
spot O
he O
had O
reached O
. O
His O
position O
in O
the O
vehicle O
|
     | O
made O
it O
impossible O
for O
him O
to O
look O
round O
, O
and O
perceive O
how O
completely O
all O
the O
acts O
that O
might O
|
     | O
be O
committed O
in O
that O

Deep B-LOC

were O

from O

but O
|
     | O
those O
engaged O
in O
them O
. O
Neither O
could O
he O
recognise O
in O
the O
dismal O
building O
detached O
, O
yet O
|
     | O
connected O
both O
with O
the O
manager O

the O
factory O
, O
the O

     | O

served O
as O

little O
aching O

, O
each O

their O
daily B-DATE

rendered O
enjoyment O

impossible O

The O
gradations O
by O
which O
all O
the O
misery O

were O

neither O

The O

out O

calling O

his O

roughly O
by O

Michael B-PERSON
a O
sign O
that O

was O
to O
pass O
through O

The O
child O
obeyed O

His O
lips O

not O

his O
very O
soul O

whisper O
within O
him O

" O

Mother O

Yet O
at O
that O
moment O
the O
unhappy O

before O
him O
  O
the O
influence O
under O
which O
he O

     | O
cowered O
thus O
, O
was O
like O
that O
produced O
by O
the O
leaden O
dimness O
of O
a O
coming O
storm O
upon O
the O
birds O

A O
long O
low O
passage O

to O
another O

was O
again O
opened O

the O
condescending O
hand O
of O

     | O
Mr. O
Woodcomb B-PERSON
  O
through O
this O

thrust O
the O
poor O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
and O
having O
either O
by O
a O
word O
or O
a O
sign O
|
     | O
made O
known O
to O
the O
governor O

Prentice O

house O

that O
he O
had O
brought O
an O
accession O
to O
his O

     | O
wretched O
crew O

he O
retired O

closing O
the O
door O

him O

Michael B-PERSON
heard O
the O
door O
close O

looked O
up O
. O
The O
room O

was O
in O

so O
long O
as O
almost O
to O

like O
a O
gallery O

from O
one B-CARDINAL
end O

other O
of O
it O
a O
narrow O
deal O
board O
stretched O
out O

room O
for O
about B-CARDINAL
two I-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
to O
sit O
down O
at O
once O
. O
The O
whole O
of O
this O
table O
was O
now O
occupied O

     | O
by O
a O
portion O
of O
the O
apprentice O
children O
, O

boys O

girls O
, O
belonging O
to O
Deep B-FAC
Valley I-FAC
Mill I-FAC
, O

     | O
and O
their O
appearance O
might O
have O
wrung O
the O
heart O
of O
any O
being O
who O
looked O
upon O
them O
, O
however O
|
     | O
blessedly O
wide O
his O
own O
destiny O
might O
lead O
him O
from O
the O
melancholy O
troop O
. O
But O
to O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
the O
|
     | O
spectacle O
was O
appalling O
  O
and O
, O
young O
as O
he O
was O
, O
he O
seemed O
to O
feel O
that O

filthy O
, O
half B-CARDINAL

starved O

     | O
wretches O
before O
him O

were O
so O
many O
ghostly O
representations O
of O
what O
he O
was O
himself O
to O
be O
. O
A O

     | O
sickness O
like O
that O
of O
death O
came O
over O
him O
, O
and O
he O
would O
have O
given O
a O
limb O
, O
only O
for O
freedom O
to O

     | O
stretch O
himself O
down O
upon O
the O

the O
master O
of O

at O
this O

feast O
of O

with O
it O

the O
power O

quelling O
with O
a O

     | O

by O
far O
the O
greater O
number O
were O
already O
dropping O
to O
sleep O

     | O
after O
a O
day O
of O
protracted O
labour O
, O
during O
which O
they O
had O
followed O
the O
ceaseless O
movements O
of O
the O

     | O
machinery O
, O
for O
above B-TIME
fifteen I-TIME
hours I-TIME
. O
Among O
the O
former O
was O
the O
hungry O
lad O
who O
had O
appropriated O

     | O
the O
oat O

cake O
of O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
and O
no O
sooner O
were O
the O
eye O
of O
the O
master O
and O
mistress O
removed O
, O
than O
he O
|
     | O
turned O
to O
the O
new O
- O
comer O
, O
and O
in O
a O
tone O
that O
seemed O
to O
hover O
between O
good O
- O
humour O
and O
ridicule O
, O
|
     | O
said O
, O
" O
So O
you O
could O
not O
find O
a O

" O

" O
I O
did O
not O

replied O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
dolefully O
. O
" O
You O
did'nt O
want O
it O

did O

you O

That O

speaks O
better O

the O

     | O
returned O
his O

" O

" O

  | O
Michael B-PERSON
was O
in O
the O
act O
of O
nodding O
assent O
to O
this O
proposal O
, O
when O
the O
woman O
, O
who O
five B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
|
     | O
before O
had O
left O
the O
room O
, O
returned O
to O
it O
, O
and O
by O
a O
very O
summary O
process O
caused O
the O
ragged O
, O
|
     | O
weary O
, O
prayerless O
, O
hopeless O
multitude O
to O
crawl O

clamber O
, O
half B-CARDINAL
sleeping O
and O
half B-CARDINAL
waking O
, O
to O
|
     | O
their O
filthy O
beds O
. O
They O
were O
divided O
by O
fifties B-DATE
in O
a O
room O
, O
but O
notwithstanding O
the O
number O
, O
and O
|
     | O
the O
little O
space O
in O
which O
they O
had O
to O
stow O
themselves O
, O
the O
stillness O
of O
heavy O
sleep O
pervaded O
|
     | O
every O
chamber O
, O
ere O
the O
miserable O
little O
inmates O
had O
been O
five B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
enclosed O
within O
the O
|
     | O
walls O
. O
Poor O
Michael B-PERSON
lay O
as O
motionless O
as O
the O
rest O
, O
but O
he O
was O
not O
sleeping O
. O
Disappointment O
, O
|
     | O
fearful O
forebodings O
, O
and O
excessive O
nausea O
, O
all O
conspired O
to O
banish O
this O
only O
blessing O
that O
an O

     | O
apprenticed O
factory O
child O
can O
know O
. O

   | O
and O
that O
under O
most O
hard O

unrelenting O
masters O
  O
but O
till O
now O
, O
he O
had O
never O
|
     | O
known O
how O
very O
wretched O
his O
young O
thoughts O
could O
make O
him O
. O
His O
mother O
's O
fond O
caresses O
, O
and O
his O

     | O
brother O
's O
fervent O
love O
, O
had O
in O
spite O
of O
toil O
, O
and O
sometimes O
in O
spite O
of O
hunger O
, O
cheered O
and O
|
     | O
comforted O
the O
last O
moments O
of O
every O
day O
. O
The O
rude O
bed O
also O
, O
on O
which O
the O
brothers O
lay O
, O
was O
too O
|
     | O
clean O
, O
notwithstanding O
all O
the O
difficulty O
of O
keeping O
it O
so O
, O
to O
be O
tainted O
with O
the O
loathsome O
|
     | O
scent O
of O
oil O
, O
or O
sundry O
other O
abominations O
which O
rendered O
the O
place O
where O
he O
now O
lay O
, O
almost O
|
     | O
intolerable O
. O
Yet O
to O
this O
den O
, O
far O
, O
far O
away O
from O
the O
only O
creatures O
who O
loved O
and O
cherished O

     | O
him O
, O
he O
was O
come O
by O
his O
own O
consent O
, O
his O
own O
express O
desire O
! O
The O
thought O
was O
almost O
too O
bitter O
|
     | O
to O
bear O
, O
and O
the O
bundle O
of O
straw O
that O
served O
him O
for O
a O
pillow O
, O
received O
for O
the B-TIME
first I-TIME
hour I-TIME
of O
|
     | O
the O
night O
a O
ceaseless O
flood O
of O
tears O
. O
|  
  | O
It O
was O
, O
as O
his O
young O
companion O
had O
predicted O
, O
by O
the O
sound O
of O
a O
flourished O
whip O
, O
that O
he O
was O
|
     | O
awakened O
on O
the O
following O
morning O
. O
In O
an O
instant O
he O
was O
on O
his O
feet O
, O
and O
a O
minute O
or O
two B-CARDINAL
more O
|
     | O
sufficed O
to O
invest O
him O
in O
his O
clothes O
  O
this O
speed O
, O
however O
, O
was O
the O
effect O
of O
terror O
, O
for O
he O
|
     | O
remembered O
not O
the O
invitation O
of O
the O
preceding O
evening O
. O
But O
hardly O
had O
he O
finished O
the O
|
     | O
operation O
of O
dressing O
, O
when O
Charley B-PERSON
Ford I-PERSON
, O
the O
boy O
who O
gave O
it O
, O
was O
by O
his O
side O
, O
and O
giving O
him O
|
     | O
a O
silent O
hint O
by O
a O
wink O
of O
the O
left O
eye O
, O
and O
a O
movement O
of O
the O
right O
elbow O
that O
he O
might O
follow O
|
     | O
him O
, O
turned O
away O
, O
and O
ran O
down O
stairs O
. O
| 
  | O
Michael B-PERSON
did O
so O
too O
, O
and O
presently O
found O
himself O
with O
a O
multitude O
of O
others O
in O
a O
small O
paved O
|
     | O
court O
, O
on O
one B-CARDINAL
side O
of O
which O
was O
a O
pump O
, O
to O
whose O
spout O
every O
child O
came O
in O
succession O
to O
|
     | O
perform O
a O
very O
necessary O
, O
but O
, O
from O
lack O
of O
soap O
, O
a O
very O
imperfect O
act O
of O
ablution O
. O
| 
  | O
Neglecting O
to O
watch O
his O
turn O
for O
this O
, O
and O
not O
permitting O
Michael B-PERSON
to O
do O
so O
either O
, O
Charles B-PERSON
|
     | I-PERSON
Ford I-PERSON
made O
his O
way O
to O
a O
door O
that O
opened O
upon O
another O
part O
of O
the O
premises O
, O
and O
pushing O
it O
open O
, O
|
     | O
disclosed O
to O
the O
eyes O
of O
Michael B-PERSON
a O
loathsome O
and O
a O
fearful O
spectacle O
. O
| 
  | O
Seven B-CARDINAL
or O
eight B-CARDINAL
boys O
had O
already O
made O
their O
way O
to O
the O
sort O
of O
rude O
farm O
- O
yard O
upon O
which O
this O
|
     | O
door O
opened O
, O
one O
and O
all O
of O
whom O
were O
intent O
upon O
purloining O
from O
a O
filthy O
trough O
just O
|
     | O
replenished O
for O
the O
morning B-TIME
meal O
of O
two B-CARDINAL
stout O
hogs O
, O
a O
variety O
of O
morsels O
which O
, O
as O
Michael B-PERSON
's O
|
     | O
new O
acquaintance O
assured O
him O
, O
were O
" O
dainty O
eating O
for O
the O
starving O
prentices O
of O
Deep B-LOC

" O

  | O
" O
Make O
haste O
, O
young'un O
, O
" O
cried O
Charles B-PERSON
, O
good O
- O
naturedly O
, O
" O
or O
they O
wo O
n't O
leave O
a O
turnip O
— O
paring O
|
     | O
for O
us O
. O
" O
And O
on O
he O
rushed O
to O
the O
scuffle O
, O
leaving O
Michael B-PERSON
gazing O
with O
disgust O
and O
horror O
at O
the O
|
     | O
contest O
between O
the O
fierce O
snouts O
of O
the O
angry O
pigs O
, O
and O
the O
active O
fingers O
of O
the O
wretched O
|
     | O
crew O
who O
contested O
with O
them O
for O
the O
offal O
thus O
cast O
forth O
. O
| 
   | O
place O
where O
little O
boys O
were O
treated O
with O
less O
care O
and O
tenderness O
than O
pigs O
! O
|  
  | O
He O
turned O
away O
shuddering O
, O
and O
feeling O
almost O
unable O
to O
stand O
— O
and O
then O
the O
image O
of O
his O
|
     | O
mother O
seemed O
to O
rise O
before O
him O
— O
he O
felt O
her O
soft O
gentle O
kisses O
on O
his O
cheeks O
, O
and O
almost O
|
     | O
unconsciously O
pronounced O
her O
name O
. O
This O
dear O
name O
, O
lowly O
as O
it O
was O
murmured O
, O
came O
upon O
his O
ear O
|
     | O
so O
like O
the O
knell B-PERSON
of O
happiness O
that O
was O
never O
to O
return O
, O
that O
the O
hard O
agony O
of O
his O
little O
|
     | O
heart O
melted O
before O
it O
, O
and O
sitting O
down O
upon O
a O
bundle O
of O
fagots O
that O
were O
piled O
up O
against O
the O
|
     | O
wall O
, O
he O
rested O
his O
burning O
head O
against O
the O
bricks O
, O
and O
burst O
into O
a O
passion O
of O
tears O
. O
At O
this O
|
     | O
moment O
he O
felt O
a O
hand O
upon O
his O
shoulder O
, O
and O
trembling O
from O
head O
to O
foot O
, O
he O
sprung O
upon O
his O
|
     | O
feet O
, O
and O
suddenly O
turning O
round O
beheld O
, O
instead O
of O
the O
savage O
features O
of O
the O
overlooker O
which O
|
     | O
his O
fancy O
had O
conjured O
up O
, O
the O
meekest O
, O
gentlest O
, O
loveliest O
little O
face O
, O
that O
ever O
eyes O
looked O
|
     | O
upon O
, O
within O
a B-QUANTITY
few I-QUANTITY
feet I-QUANTITY
of O
him O
. O
It O
was O
the O
same O
little O
girl O
who O
had O
been O
placed O
next O
him O
at O
the O
|
     | O
miserable O
supper O
of O
the B-TIME
preceding I-TIME
night I-TIME
, O
and O
whose O
low O
murmur O
of O
pity O
for O
all O
the O
sorrow O
he O
was O
|
     | O
come O
to O
share O
with O
her O
, O
had O
reached O
his O
ears O
and O
his O
heart O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
You O
'll O
be O
strapped O
dreadful O
if O
you O
bide O
here O
, O
" O
said O
the O
child O
. O
" O
Come O
away O
— O
and O
do O
n't O
let O
|
     | O
them O
see O
you O
cry O
! O
" O
But O
even O
as O
she O
spoke O
she O
turned O
from O
him O
, O
and O
ran O
towards O
the O
door O
through O
|
     | O
which O
the O
miserable O
pilferers O
of O
the O
pig O
- O
trough O
were O
already O
hurrying O
. O
| 
  | O
Perhaps O
no O
other O
warning O
- O
voice O
would O
have O
been O
so O
promptly O
listened O
to O
at O
that O
moment O
by O
poor O
|
     | O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
for O
it O
was O
something O
very O
like O
the O
numbing O
effect O
of O
despair O
that O
seemed O
to O
have O
|
     | O
seized O
upon O
him O
, O
and O
it O
is O
likely O
enough O
he O
would O
have O
remained O
in O
the O
attitude O
he O
had O
taken O
, O
|
     | O
with O
his O
head O
resting O
against O
the O
wall O
, O
till O
the O
brutal O
violence O
of O
his O
task O
- O
master O
had O
dragged O
|
     | O
him O
from O
it O
, O
had O
not O
this O
pretty O
vision O
of O
pity O
appeared O
to O
warn O
him O
of O
his O
danger O
. O
| 
  | O
He O
rose O
and O
followed O
her O
so O
quickly O
, O
that O
by O
the O
time O
she O
had O
reached O
the O
crowd O
of O
children O
|
     | O
who O
were O
still O
thronging O
round O
the O
pump O
, O
he O
was O
by O
her O
side O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Thank O
you O
! O
" O
whispered O
Michael B-PERSON
in O
her O
ear O
, O
" O
It O
was O
very O
kind O
of O
you O
to O
call O
me O
— O
and O
I O

     | O
should O
n't O
have O
come O
if O
you O
had O
n't O

for O
I O
should O
n't O
care O
very O
much O
if O
they O
killed O
me O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
That O
's O
very O
naughty O
! O
" O
said O
the O
little O
girl O

The O

enter O

bound O

     | O
helpless O

truly O

found O
somebody O
of O
whom O
he O

     | O
might O
make O
a O
friend O

and O
so O
strongly O
did O
the O
poor O
little O
fellow O
feel O
it O
, O
that O
when O
the O

     | O
miserable O
band O
were O
led O
to O
their O
morning B-TIME
meal O
, O
he O
told O
Fanny B-PERSON
as O
he O
walked O
beside O
her O
, O
that O
he O

     | O
thought O
he O
should O
grow O
to O
behave O
better O
than O
he O
had O
done O
that B-TIME
morning I-TIME
, O
if O
she O
would O
always O
talk O

     | O
to O
him O
about O
good O
things O
, O
and O
let O
him O
talk O
about O
mother O

Teddy B-PERSON
to O
her O
in O
return O
. O

" O
There O

good O
boy O

" O

she O
added O
, O
as O
they O
sat O
down O
again O
side O
by O
side O
at O
the O
long O
dirty O

Michael B-PERSON

manfully O
, O
as O

supped O
the O
musty O

Miss O

the O

spirited O

     | O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
again O
and O
again O
declared O
it O

" O
impossible O

out O

from O
Sir O

himself O
, O
delicately O
enveloped O
, O
highly O
scented O

sealed O
with O

     | O
prodigiously O
fine O
armorial O
bearings O

But O
all O
this O
perfection O

was O
lost O
on O
poor O

heart O

turned O
the O

forth O

worth O
hearing O
on O

the O

if O
you O
encourage O
her O
in O

such O
tantrums O

her O

set O
out O
upon O

journey O

day O

replied O
her O
friend O
. O
| 
  | O
For O
a O
moment O
, O
this O
opinion O
brought O
some O
consolation O
with O
it O
, O
simply O
from O
the O
decision O
with O
|
     | O
which O
it O
was O
uttered O
  O
but O
the O
next O
, O
all O
her O
anxiety O
returned O
again O
, O
for O
though O
she O
felt O
that O
|
     | O
there O
was O
, O
perhaps O
, O
something O
improbable O
and O
exaggerated O
in O
the O
idea O
of O
the O
child O
's O
being O

     | O
kidnapped O
in O
the O
face O
of O
day O

and O
at O
it O
were O
before O
a O
hundred B-CARDINAL
witnesses O
, O
there O
was O
at O

no O

     | O
delusion O
as O
to O
his O
unhappy O
mother O
's O
state O
of O
mind O
respecting O
him O

in O
the O
fact O

her O

in O
some O

pledged O
her O

word O

| 
  | O
A O
little O
further O
conversation O
with O
Mrs. O

convinced O
her O
that O
her O
opinion O

could O
be O
of O
no O
great O
value O

No O

thought O
Mary B-PERSON

" O
Nor O
was O
it O
likely O

acted O

spoken O
as O
I O
saw O
him O

when O
his O
poor O

I O

daily O

the O

opportunity O

conversing O
with O
him O
alone O

She O
was O
by O
herself O
in O
her O
pretty O
boudoir O
when O
he O
arrived O
, O
and O
perceiving O
that O
his O
pale O
face O

     | O
was O
flushed O
by O
heat O
and O
exercise O

she O
made O
him O
sit O
down O
on O
the O
sofa O
, O
beside O
her O
. O

  | O
There O
was O
something O
singularly O
sad O
in O
the O
utter O
indifference O
with O
which O
his O
young O
eye O
|
     | O
wandered O
over O
all O
the O
striking O
and O
unwonted O
objects O
that O
surrounded O
him O

When O
bad O

the O
young O
lady O
on O
her O
silken O
couch O

obeyed O
without O
seeming O
at O
all O
conscious O
that O
the O
rest O
he O

     | O
needed O
was O
now O
afforded O
in O
more O
dainty O
style O
than O
usual O
, O
and O
all O
the O
intelligence O
of O
his O
soul O

     | O
seemed O
settled O
in O
his O
eyes O
as O
he O
looked O
into O
the O
face O
of O
Miss B-PERSON
Brotherton I-PERSON
, O
and O
faintly O
murmured O

     | O
— O

" O
Is O
there O
any O
news O

" O

   | O
my O
dear O
boy O

this O
delay O
can O
not O
justify O
the O
look O

misery O
it O
produces O
on O
your O

Tell O
me O
, O
Edward B-PERSON

what O
is O
it O
that O
you O
fear O
for O
Michael B-PERSON

" O

  | O
" O
I O
do O
not O
know O
myself O

" O
replied O
the O
boy O
. O
" O
And O
yet O
I O
think O
it O
over O
in O
my O
head O
day O

night O

only O

your O
poor O
mother O
has O
only O
you O

     | O
left O
to O
comfort O
her O

that O
you O
should O
only O
strive O

fill O
your O
own O
head O

hers O
with O
the O
very O

     | O
worst O
thoughts O
your O
fancy O

conjure O
up O

" O
I O
do O
not O
fill O
mother O

head O
with O
them O

" O
replied O
Edward B-PERSON
. O
" O
I O
have O
never O
told O
her O
one B-CARDINAL
single O

     | O
word O
of O
all O
my O
dismal O
thoughts O

" O

" O
Then O
you O
are O
a O
good O
boy O

I O
love O
you O

it O

But O
what O
are O
your O
dismal O
thoughts O

Edward B-PERSON

     | O
You O
may O
tell O
them O

me O

" O

  | O
The O
boy O
hesitated O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
and O
then O
said O
— O
" O
I O
think O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling I-PERSON
is O
a O
wicked O
, O
|
     | O
cruel O
man O
  O
and O
I O
think O
that O
he O
would O
be O
more O
likely O
to O
be O
wicked O
and O
cruel O
to O
Michael B-PERSON
than O
good O

     | O
to O
him O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
What O
is O
it O
has O
made O
you O
think O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
cruel O

wicked O
, O
Edward B-PERSON

" O
demanded O
Miss B-PERSON
|
     | I-PERSON
Brotherton I-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Because O
he O
is O
hard O
and O
unjust O
to O
those O
who O
labour O
for O
him O
— O
and O
because O
I O
have O
seen O
him O
|
     | O
laugh O
and O
make O
sport O
of O
the O
tears O
of O
little O
children O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
There O
was O
something O
in O
the O
accents O
of O
the O
boy O
that O
startled O
Mary B-PERSON
. O
— O
She O
felt O
inclined O
to O
|
     | O
exclaim O
— O
" O
How O
much O
more O
older O
art O
thou O
than O
thy O
looks O
! O
" O
so O
thrilling O
was O
the O
tone O
, O
and O
so O
|
     | O
profound O
the O
feeling O
with O
which O
he O
spoke O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Yet O
still O
, O
" O
she O
replied O
, O
" O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
see O
that O
he O
could O
gain O
any O
advantage O
by O
|
     | O
ill O
- O
using O
Michael B-PERSON
in O
any O
way O
bad O
enough O
to O
make O
you O
look O
so O
miserable O
, O
Edward B-PERSON
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
If O
he O
keeps O
him O
from O
me O
is O
not O
that O
enough O
? O
" O
said O
the O
pale O
boy O
, O
looking O
reproachfully O
at O
|
     | O
her O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
But O
, O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
you O
knew O
that O
he O
was O
going O
to O
leave O
you O
  O
and O
your O
mother O
, O
at O
least O
, O
consented O
|
     | O
to O
it O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Yes O
, O
she O
did O
consent O
to O
it O
. O
Poor O
, O
dear O
mother O
! O
She O
did O
consent O
to O
it O

But O
had O
I O
been O
true O
, O

     | O
as O
I O
ought O
to O
have O
been O
, O
she O
never O
would O
, O
" O
said O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
clasping O
his O
hands O
and O
closing O
his O
eyes O

     | O
with O
a O
look O
of O
intense O
suffering O
. O

  | O
" O
Explain O
yourself O
, O
my O
dear O
boy O
, O

said O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
kindly O
. O
" O
In O
what O
have O
you O
been O
otherwise O
than O
|
     | O
true O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
We O
agreed O
together O
— O
poor O
Michael B-PERSON

me O
agreed O
together O
, O
never O
to O
let O
mother O
know O
how O
bad O

     | O
we O
were O
served O
at O
the O
mill O
— O
and O
, O
above O
all O
, O
we O
agreed O
that O
she O
should O
never O
know O
how O
miserable O
|
     | O
Michael B-PERSON
was O
at O
the O
great O
house O
, O
'cause O
we O
was O
sure O
she O
'd O
have O
him O
away O
, O

so O
lose O
the O
bit O
of O

     | O
comfortable O
food O
she O
has O
been O
having O
. O
But O
it O
was O
wrong O
and O
wicked O
to O
deceive O
her O
. O
We O
should O

     | O
have O
told O
her O
all O
, O

then O
Michael B-PERSON
would O
have O
never O
gone O
! O
" O

being O
still O
comforted O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
by O
our O
manner O
of O
talking O
to O
her O
. O
Fear O

     | O
not O
, O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
that O
I O
shall O
neglect O
the O
safety O
of O
Michael B-PERSON

you O
will O
not O
hear O
me O

his O
being O
in O
any O

I O
will O
not O

I O
know O
what O
has O
become O
of O
him O
. O
" O
|  
  | O
Mary B-PERSON
said O
this O
in O
a O
tone O
that O
left O
no O
doubt O
of O
her O
sincerity O
  O
and O
it O
was O
then O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
|
     | O
time O
that O
Edward B-PERSON
seemed O
to O
remember O
her O
greatness O
. O
He O
stood O
up O
before O
her O
with O
a O
look O
of O
tender O

     | O
reverence O
inexpressibly O
touching O
, O

said O
solemnly O
— O

bless O
you O

it O

he O
will O
bless O
you O

my O
dear O
child O

" O
replied O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
with O
tears O
starting O
to O
her O
eyes O
. O
" O
He O

learn O
to O

by O
degrees O
we O
shall O
get O
you O
on O
to O

may O
make O
a O

The O

smiled O
languidly O

bright O

mantled O

it O

my O

that O

all O

You O
would O

     | O
hardly O
believe O

that O
a O

loud O
enough O

And O
before O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
could O
answer O

William B-PERSON

already O
opened O
the O
door O
, O
and O
let O
down O
the O

     | O
steps O

It O
was O
very O
easy O
to O
get O
out O
, O
and O
very O
easy O
to O
inquire O
if O
Mr. O
Bell B-PERSON
were O
at O
home O

when O
|
     | O
answered O
in O
the O
affirmative O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
felt O
that O
it O
was O
not O
very O
easy O
to O
decide O
in O
what O

     | O
manner O
to O
explain O
the O
cause O
of O
her O
visit O

the O
object O

it O

She O
had O
by O
no O
means O
settled O
this O
|
     | O
point O
to O
her O
satisfaction O
, O
when O
the O
door O
of O
a O
small O
parlour O
, O
lined O
with O
books O
, O
was O
opened O
to O

     | O
her O
, O
and O
she O
found O
herself O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
gentleman O
she O
had O
so O
unceremoniously O
come O
to O

     | O
visit O
. O
| 
  | O
There O
was O
much O
in O
the O
countenance O
of O
Mr. O
Bell B-PERSON
to O
reassure O
a O
more O
timid O
spirit O
than O
that O
of O
|
     | O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton I-PERSON
  O
nevertheless O
she O
stood O
before O
him O
for O
a B-TIME
minute I-TIME
or O
two B-CARDINAL
in O
some O
embarrassment O
, O
|
     | O
not O
so O
much O
from O
fear O
of O
him O
, O
as O
of O
herself O
. O
Did O
she O
fail O
to O
make O
him O
at O
once O
understand O
the O
|
     | O
motive O
of O
her O
inquiries O
, O
he O
could O
not O
avoid O
thinking O
both O
them O
and O
herself O
impertinent O
, O
and O
|
     | O
this O
consciousness O
caused O
a O
much O
brighter O
glow O
than O
usual O
to O
mantle O
her O
cheeks O
, O
as O
the O
stood O
|
     | O
before O
him O
, O
with O
her O
eyes O
fixed O
timidly O
, O
and O
almost O
beseechingly O
, O
on O
his O
face O
. O

Although O
Miss O

not O
quite O
the O

assured O

of O
a O

was O
enough O
in O
her O
appearance O
to O
indicate O
her O
claim O
to O
observance O
, O
as O

     | O
well O
as O
admiration O
, O
and O
Mr. O
Bell B-PERSON
opened O
the O
conversation O
by O
earnestly O
requesting O
that O
she O
would O
|
     | O
sit O
down O
. O
| 
  | O
His O
aspect O
had O
done O
much O
towards O
giving O
her O
courage O
, O
and O
his O
voice O
did O
more O
. O

" O

Circumstances O
, O
Mr. O
Bell B-PERSON
, O
have O
lately O
directed O
my O
attention O
to O
a O
subject O

my O
own O

     | O
situation O
in O
life O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
neighbourhood O
in O

I O

ought O
to O
have O
long O
ago O
made O

familiar O

such O
is O
not O
the O
case O
, O
however O
  O
I O
am O
profoundly O
, O
and O
I O
fear O
|
     | O
shamefully O
ignorant O
respecting O
the O
large O

very O
important O
class O
of O
our O
population O
employed O
in O

     | O

I O
am O
in O
possession O
of O
a O
large O
fortune O
wholly O
amassed O
from O
the O
profits O
obtained O

     | O
by O
my O
father O
from O
this O
species O
of O

I O
can O
not O

feel O
great O
interest O
in O
the O
welfare O

and O
prosperity O
of O
the O
people O

in O

I O
understand O
a O
very O
large O

I O

  | O
Mr. O

, O
who O
had O
placed O
himself O
immediately O
opposite O

her O
, O
looked O
in O
her O
young O
face O

     | O
listened O
to O
her O
earnest O
voice O

she O
spoke O
, O
with O
the O
deepest O
attention O
. O
It O
soon O
became O
|
     | O
sufficiently O
clear O
that O
he O
considered O
not O
this O
intrusion O
as O
requiring O
apology O
, O
but O
that O
on O
the O
|
     | O
contrary O
his O
very O
heart O

soul O
were O
moved O
by O
her O
words O

He O
paused O
for O
a O
moment O
after O
she O
had O

     | O
ceased O
speaking O
, O
as O
if O
unwilling O
to O
interrupt O
her O

his O
reply O
  O
but O
when O
he O
found O
that O

remained O
silent O

he O
said O

one O
from O
which O
the O
rich O

district O
turn O
away O
with O
loathing O

contempt O

is O

     | O
it O
the O
one O
of O
all O
others O

can O
not O

wounding O
many O
prejudices O

of O

cursed O

startled O

the O

low O
moaning O
from O

at O
a O
short O

turning O
towards O

perceived O
a O

appeared O
sinking O

me O
close O

found O
on O

examination O
that O
the O

exhausted O

totally O
incapable O

pursuing O

     | O
her O
way O

it O
was O
her O

mother O

was O
urging O
her O
forward O
, O

who O
even O

seemed O
more O

     | O
intent O

on O
the O

I O
know O

poor O

wretch O

that O
little O

the O

fervour O

the O

that O
it O
fails O
to O
prove O
mutual O

it O
was O
with O
a O

     | O
cordial O
sincerity O
, O
as O
genuine O
as O
her O
own O
, O
that O
Mr. O
Bell B-PERSON
expressed O
his O
hope O
that O
their O

     | O
acquaintance O
would O
ripen O
into O
friendship O

Too O
intently O
occupied O
by O
all O
that O
had O
passed O
, O
to O
remember O
her O
own O
arrangements O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
forgot O

     | O
that O
her O
carriage O
was O
not O
at O
the O
door O
, O
and O
while O
these O
parting O
words O
were O
exchanged O
, O
walked O
|
     | O
forth O
, O
expecting O
to O
find O
it O
. O
It O
was O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
who O
first B-ORDINAL
recollected O
that O
the O
coachman O
had O
|
     | O
been O
ordered O
to O
put O
up O
his O
horses O
at O
the O
nearest O
inn O
, O
but O
this O
was O
not O
till O
they O
had O
traversed O
|
     | O
the O
little O
garden O
, O
and O
were O
already O
in O
the O
lane O
  O
for O
though O
the O
good O
nurse O
had O
been O
little O
more O
|
     | O
than O
|  | O
personnage O
muet O
|  | O
during O
the O
foregoing O
scene O
, O
she O
had O
taken O
a O
deep O
interest O
in O
it O
, O
|
     | O
and O
it O
was O
much O
with O
the O
air O
of O
one B-CARDINAL
awaking O
from O
a O
dream O
, O
that O
she O
said O
, O
" O
My O
dear O
Miss O
Mary B-PERSON
! O
|
     | O
you O
have O
forgot O
that O
the O
carriage O
is O
sent O
away O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Indeed O
have O
I O
! O
" O
said O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
laughing O
, O
" O
and O
no O
wonder O
. O
But O
there O
stands O
our O
faithful O
William B-PERSON
, O
|
     | O
he O
will O
tell O
us O
in O
what O
direction O
we O
may O
find O
it O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Will O
you O
not O
return O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
, O
while O
it O
is O
made O
ready O
? O
" O
said O
the O
clergyman O
. O

  | O
" O
Not O
if O
you O
will O
walk O
on O
with O
us O
, O
dear O
sir O

The O
evening B-TIME
is O
delightful O
, O
but O
already O
quite O
far O

     | O
enough O
advanced O
to O
make O
it O
prudent O
not O
to O
lose O
any O
time O

" O
And O
having O
given O
orders O
that O
the O
|
     | O
carriage O
was O
to O
follow O
, O
they O
strolled O
on O
towards O
the O
turnpike O
. O

  | O
" O
There O
, O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Bell B-PERSON
, O
pointing O
to O
the O
towering O
chimneys O
of O
a O
large O
factory O
at O
some O

, O
" O
there O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
, O
is O
an O
establishment O
where O
, O
though O
carding O

spinning O
go O
on O

some B-CARDINAL
hundreds I-CARDINAL
of O
children O

are O
employed O
in O
attending O
the O

     | O
machinery O
that O
performs O
the O
process O
, O
the O
voice O
of O
misery O

never O
heard O
, O
for O
there O
the O
love O
of O

     | O
gold O

chained O

held O
captive O
by O
religion O

" O

" O
Thank O
God O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
as O
she O
looked O
at O
the O
sinless O
monster O
to O
which O
he O
pointed O
. O
" O
It O
is O

     | O
not O
of O

, O
that O
this O

fatal O

all O

" O

The O
high O

losing O
thousands B-DATE

down O

     | O
only O
be O
pointed O
at O

pitiably O

all O
the O

All O

I O

believe O

Miss O

" O
he O
continued O

after O
a O
pause O

" O
I O
do O
most O
truly O

     | O
believe O

now O
they O

in O

if O
the O

exactly O
the O
change O
we O
ask O

The O
plan O

of O

pursued O

of O

But O
it O
is O

     | O
quite O
certain O
that O
the O

upon O

never O
before O
witnessed O
the O
hideous O

     | O
approach O
of O
contagion O
. O
The O
general O
appearance O
too O
of O
the O
Deep B-LOC
Valley I-LOC
troop O
was O
so O
far O
from O

     | O
healthy O
, O
that O
the O
sickly O
aspect O
of O
those O
first B-ORDINAL
seized O
upon O
was O
less O
remarkable O
than O
it O
would O
|
     | O
have O
been O
elsewhere O
. O
Thus O
another B-DATE
week I-DATE
wore O
away O
, O
during O
which O
, O
though O
several O
of O
those O
who O

     | O
been O
working O
when O
it O
began O
were O
withdrawn O

known O
to O
be O
in O
the O
sick O

ward O
ere O
it O
closed O
, O
the O

     | O
fact O
that O
an O
infectious O
fever O
was O
among O
them O
had O
not O

got O
wing O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Poor O
dear O
Betsy B-PERSON
Price I-PERSON
! O
" O
whispered O
Fanny B-PERSON
Fletcher I-PERSON
to O
her O
friend O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
as O
they O
sat O
side O
by O
|
     | O
side O
at O
their O
miserable O
dinner O
one B-DATE
day I-DATE
. O
" O
I O
heard O
missis O
tell O
master O
that O
she O
was O
dead O
. O
But O
I O
am O
|
     | O
trying O
to O
be O
glad O
for O
it O
Michael B-PERSON
. O
" O
| 
   | O
liked O
her O
more O
than O
any O
other O
girl O
in O
the O
mill O
, O
and O
now O
you O
are O
glad O
she O
is O

     | O
dead O
! O
" O
|  
  | O
" O
I O
am O
not O
so O
glad O
as O
I O
think O
I O
ought O
to O
be O
, O
" O
returned O
Fanny B-PERSON
gently O
. O
" O
She O
will O
not O
be O
hungry O
|
     | O
in O
Heaven O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
nor O
will O
she O
work O
till O
she O
is O
ready O
to O
fall O
: O
and O
surely O
God O
will O
give O
us O

     | O
green O
fields O
and O
sweet O
fresh O
air O
in O
Heaven O
, O
and O
there O
must O
be O
flowers O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
. O
Oh O
! O
I O
am O
quite O
|
     | O
sure O
of O
that O
, O
and O
Betsy B-PERSON
Price I-PERSON
will O
have O
it O
all O
! O
Ought O
I O
not O
to O
be O
very O
, O
very O
, O
glad O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
Michael B-PERSON
looked O
in O
her O
sweet O
, O
innocent O
face O
, O
as O
she O
said O
this O
, O
and O
tears O
filled O
his O
eyes O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
And O
if O
you O
die O
, O
Fanny B-PERSON
, O
must O
I O
be O
glad O
too O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
If O
you O
thought O
about O
Heaven O
as O
I O
do O
, O
and O
if O
you O
loved O
me O
very O
much O
indeed O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
|
     | O
little O
girl O
, O
" O
I O
ca O
n't O
tell O
how O
you O
could O
help O
being O
glad O

" O

  | O
" O
But O
I O
do O
love O
you O
very O
much O
indeed O
, O
" O
said O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
almost O
choked O
by O
his O
efforts O
not O
to O
cry O
, O
|
     | O
" O
and O
I O
do O
think O
of O
Heaven O
, O
too O
, O
Fanny B-PERSON
, O
but O
I O
could'nt O
be O
glad O
if O
you O
was O
to O
die O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Not O
when O
you O
hear O
that O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
! O
" O
said O
Fanny B-PERSON
, O
starting O
up O
as O
the O
lash O
of O
the O
governor O
's O
whip O
|
     | O
resounded O
through O
the O
room O
as O
a O
signal O
that O
their O
numbered O
moments O
of O
rest O
were O
over O
. O
" O
I O
|
     | O
suppose O
then O
I O
love O
you O
better O
than O
you O
love O
me O
, O
for O
I O
could O
not O
help O
being O
glad O
if O
I O
knew O
that O
|
     | O
you O
would O
never O
hear O
nor O
feel O
that O
lash O
again O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
When O
they O
met O
again O
at O
supper O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
though O
still O
unsuspicious O
of O
the O
cause O
, O
missed O
three B-CARDINAL
|
     | O
more O
children O
from O
their O
places O
. O
He O
fancied O
, O
too O
, O
that O
there O
was O
something O
new O
and O
strange O
in O
|
     | O
the O
aspect O
of O
their O
hard O
- O
featured O
female O
tyrant O
  O
she O
was O
paler O
than O
usual O
, O
scolded O
not O
at O
all O
, O
|
     | O
and O
when O
she O
spoke O
to O
her O
husband O
, O
it O
was O
in O
a O
voice O
that O
hardly O
exceeded O
a O
whisper O
. O
Yet O
, O
|
     | O
notwithstanding O
this O
, O
some O
young O
ears O
again O
caught O
words O
that O
told O
of O
death O
. O
Yet O
still O
the O
mill O
|
     | O
worked O
on O
, O
and O
nothing O
seemed O
to O
mark O
that O
any O
calamity O
more O
than O
usual O
had O
got O
among O
them O
. O
| 
  | O
By O
degrees O
, O
however O
, O
the O
growing O
pestilence O
burst O
forth O
, O
as O
it O
were O
, O
before O
the O
eyes O
of O
the O
|
     | O
terrified O
children O
, O
and O
they O
knew O
that O
the O
grave O
yawned O
before O
them O
all O
. O
Then O
it O
was O
that O
the O
|
     | O
ghastly O
countenances O
of O
each O
doomed O
victim O
struck O
dismay O
into O
the O
hearts O
of O
their O
companions O
|
     | O
even O
before O
they O
were O
permitted O
to O
leave O
their O
labour O
, O
and O
sink O
down O
to O
the O
rest O
that O
should O
be O
|
     | O
disturbed O
no O
more O
. O
But O
still O
the O
mill O
went O
on O
, O
for O
Mr. O
Elgood B-PERSON
Sharpton I-PERSON
had O
just O
received O
a O
|
     | O
glorious O
order O
from O
Russia B-GPE
, O
and O
it O
would O
have O
been O
perfect O
madness O
, O
as O
this O
gentlemen O
was O
heard O
|
     | O
to O
remark O
to O
his O
eldest O
son O
, O
if O
a O
death O
or O
two B-CARDINAL
among O
the O
apprentice O
children O
was O
to O
check O
the O
|
     | O
mill O
at O
such O
a O
time O
as O
that O
. O
| 
  | O
So O
the O
mill O
went O
on O
, O
and O
death O
went O
on O
too O
. O
But O
as O
it O
is O
considered O
by O
all O
parties O
concerned O
|
     | O
to O
be O
extremely O
important O
that O
the O
cry O
of O
epidemic O
contagion O
should O
not O
be O
raised O
in O
the O
|
     | O
neighbourhood O
of O
a O
factory O
under O
these O
circumstances O

it O
was O
deemed O
best O

     | O
that O
could O

threatened O

not O
the O

part O

his O
wisdom O
upon O
this O

systematically O

laid O
her O

his O

enforce O
her O

looking O
wistfully O
in O

     | O
aloud O

" O
Do O
Michael B-PERSON

" O
the O
sick O
dragon O
stepped O
back O
on O
hearing O
them O
, O
from O
the O
passage O
that O

     | O
led O
into O
the O
kitchen O
, O
and O
turning O
her O
ghastly O
face O
full O
upon O
them O
, O
exclaimed O
, O
while O
her O
languid O

     | O
fist O
strove O
in O
vain O
to O
clench O

raise O
itself O
, O
as O
in O
days B-DATE

ere O

the O

her O
fever O

sank O

almost O

Greatly O
terrified O

both O

they O
screamed O
in O

was O
no O

so O
that O
their O
loud O

the O

beyond O

that O
the O

But O
when O

that O
the O
awful O
strength O
of O
Mrs. O

laid O

when O
the O

had O
once O

pronounced O
aloud O
, O
the O
palpable O

     | O
image O
of O
the O
pale O
tyrant O
seemed O
to O
stand O
frowning O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
them O
, O
substituting O
his O

     | O
grisley O
hour O
- O
glass O

for O
the O
fist O
, O
and O
the O
frown O
he O
had O
conquered O

  | O
The O
scene O
which O
followed O
this O
was O
very O
frightful O
. O
— O
Those O
upon O
whom O
infection O
had O
seized O
, O
|
     | O
sunk O
from O
their O
work O
at O
once O
, O
despite O
the O
goading O
thong O
which O
had O
hitherto O
kept O
them O
from O

dropping O

as O

horse O

While O
those O
who O
were O
yet O

     | O
untouched O
looked O
in O
each O
other O

faces O
as O
if O
to O
watch O
who O
next O
should O
fall O

When O
the O
children O
|
     | O
from O
all O
the O
different O
floors O
of O
the O
fabric O
met O
together O
at O
their O
midday B-TIME
meal O
, O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
|
     | O
thought O
of O
each O
seemed O
to O
be O
the O
finding O
out O
who O
was O
missing O
since O

they O
assembled O
, O

the O

     | O
shudder O
that O
followed O
the O
perceiving O
another O
and O
another O
, O
and O
another O
gone O
, O
ran O
along O
the O

     | O
shortening O
lines O
with O
an O
agony O
which O
grew O
more O
and O
more O
intense O
as O
their O
numbers O
lessened O
. O
| 
  | O
When O
things O
had O
reached O
this O
state O
, O
Mr. O
Elgood B-PERSON
Sharpton I-PERSON
agreed O
with O
Mr. O
Poulet B-PERSON
that O
it O
might O
|
     | O
perhaps O
be O
as O
well O
to O
let O
an O
apothecary O
from O
Tugswell B-PERSON
visit O
the O
factory O
, O
to O
which O
reluctant O
|
     | O
decision O
two B-CARDINAL
reasons O
strongly O
contributed O
. O
The O
first B-ORDINAL
was O
, O
that O
though O
with O
his O
usual O
|
     | O
fore O
- O
thought O
he O
had O
divided O
his O
nocturnal O
burying O
between O
the O
churchyards O
of O
Tugswell B-PERSON
and O
|
     | O
Meddington B-ORG
, O
the O
clergymen O
of O
both O
had O
declared O
that O
their O
frequency O
rendered O
it O
necessary O
that O
|
     | O
some O
inquiry O
should O
be O
made O
into O
the O
cause O
of O
so O
great O
a O
mortality O
— O
and O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
was O
that O
|
     | O
the O
fact O
of O
the O
mistress O
of O
the O
apprentice O
house O
, O
being O
herself O
at O
the O
point O
of O
death O
from O
the O
|
     | O
same O
malady O
, O
must O
infallibly O
prove O
to O
the O
medical O
visitant O
that O
it O
was O
no O
treatment O
peculiar O
to O
|
     | O
the O
children O
which O
had O
occasioned O
it O
, O
but O
that O
it O
had O
come O
beyond O
all O
possibility O
of O
|
     | O
contradiction O
by O
the O
visitation O
of O
God O
. O
| 
  | O
Nevertheless O
the O
medical O
gentleman O
ventured O
to O
declare O
that O
nothing O
would O
be O
so O
likely O
to O
|
     | O
stop O
the O
contagion O
as O
nourishing O
food O
  O
upon O
which O
the O
terrified O
manufacturer O
astonished O
all O
the O
|
     | O
butchers O
within O
his O
reach O
, O
by O
commanding O
a O
large O
supply O
of O
beef O
and O
mutton O
" O
|  | O
good O
enough O
to O
|
      | O
make O
wholesome O
soup O
|  | O
, O
" O
and O
before O
another B-DATE
ghastly I-DATE
week I-DATE
had O
passed O
away O
, O
the O
wisdom O
of O
|
     | O
this O
prescription O
became O
so O
evident O
that O
when O
settling O
accounts O
together O
at O
the O
end O
of O
it O
, O
Mr. O
|
     | O
Poulet B-PERSON
hinted O
to O
his O
employer O
that O
he O
did O
not O
feel O
quite O
sure O
whether O
upon O
the O
whole O
a O
|
        | O
little O
|  | O
better O
living O
for O
the O
apprentices O
might O
not O
pay O
. O
| 
  | O
For O
all O
answer O
Mr. O
Elgood B-PERSON
Sharpton I-PERSON
put O
his O
finger O
to O
the O
sum O
total O
for O

the B-DATE

     | I-DATE

then O
turning O
back O
a O
page O

two B-CARDINAL

the O
huge O
volume O
, O
did O
the O

by O
the O

total O
of O
a B-DATE
former I-DATE

that O

shall O
have O
no O

left O

of O
Mrs. O
Poulet B-PERSON
, O
Michael B-PERSON
and O
his O
friend O
Fanny B-PERSON
, O
both O
continued O

     | O
as O
it O
seemed O
, O
unscathed O
, O
and O
many O
were O
the O
grave O
discussions O
between O

as O
to O
whether O
they O

     | O
ought O
to O
be O
sorry O
or O
glad O
that O
they O
were O
so O
— O
Fanny B-PERSON
very O
steadily O
adhering O
to O
her O
first B-ORDINAL
|
     | O
opinion O
, O
that O
if O
they O
had O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
love O
for O
each O
other O
, O
they O
would O
not O
let O
themselves O
be O
|
     | O
sorry O
, O
if O
one O
saw O
the O
other O
go O
away O
, O
and O
Michael B-PERSON
as O
steadily O
persisting O
that O
right O
or O
wrong O
he O
|
     | O
must O
be O
so O
very O
sorry O
if O
Fanny B-PERSON
went O
, O
as O
not O
to O
care O
at O
all O
how O
soon O
he O
followed O
after O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
disinterested O
reasonings O
of O
the O
little O
girl O
were O
soon O
put O
to O
the O
proof O
. O
Michael B-PERSON
looked O
so O
|
     | O
very O
ill O
one B-TIME
morning I-TIME
at O
breakfast O
, O
that O
even O
the O
iron O
- O
hearted O
Poulet B-PERSON
told O
him O
he O
had O
best O
mount O
|
     | O
to O
the O
sick O
ward O
before O
it O
was O
needful O
to O
carry O
him O
  O
but O
Michael B-PERSON
looked O
at O
poor O
Fanny B-PERSON
, O
and O
saw O
|
     | O
such O
an O
expression O
of O
terror O
and O
misery O
in O
her O
countenance O
, O
that O
he O
could O
not O
help O
thinking O
she O
|
     | O
would O
change O
her O
mind O
about O
being O
glad O
, O
if O
he O
did O
not O
go O
into O
work O
along O
with O
her O
. O
So O
he O
told O
|
     | O
the O
governor O
that O
he O
was O
n't O
bad O
at O
all O
, O
and O
had O
rather O
work O
than O
not O
  O
an O
assurance O
, O
which O
it O
|
     | O
could O
not O
, O
under O
any O
circumstances O
, O
be O
Mr. O
Poulet B-PERSON
's O
duty O
to O
combat O
  O
and O
accordingly O
Michael B-PERSON
got O
|
     | O
to O
his O
place O
in O
the O
mill O
, O
and O
spoke O
cheeringly O
to O
Fanny B-PERSON
as O
he O
went O
along O
. O
But O
before O
the B-TIME
hour I-TIME
|
     | O
of O
dinner O
he O
was O
on O
the O
floor O
, O
and O
when O
the O
overlooker O
called O
to O
a O
stretcher O
to O
have O
him O
|
     | O
wheelbarrowed O
back O
to O
the O
' O
Prenticehouse B-PERSON
, O
Fanny B-PERSON
Fletcher I-PERSON
thought O
that O
she O
certainly O
did O
not O
|
     | O
love O
poor O
Michael B-PERSON
Armstrong I-PERSON
so O
much O
as O
she O
fancied O
she O
did O
, O
for O
that O
if O
the O
choice O
had O
been O
|
     | O
given O
her O
, O
she O
would O
a O
great O
deal O
rather O
have O
been O
taken O
ill O
herself O
. O
And O
spite O
of O
a O
strap O
that O
|
     | O
she O
saw O
coming O
towards O
her O
, O
and O
flourishing O
ready O
for O
duty O
in O
the O
air O
, O
she O
helped O
to O
drag O
the O
|
     | O
unresisting O
body O
of O
her O
poor O
companion O
from O
before O
the O
mules O
, O
and O
thoughtless O
and O
reckless O
of O
|
     | O
the O
consequences O
, O
sat O
down O
and O
held O
his O
head O
on O
her O
knee O
, O
till O
he O
was O
raised O
in O
the O
arms O
of O
the O
|
     | O
stretcher O
and O
carried O
off O
. O
It O
was O
then O
, O
and O
not O
till O
then O
, O
that O
her O
tears O
began O
to O
flow O
, O
and O
|
     | O
they O
flowed O
so O
fast O
, O
that O
she O
could O
no O
longer O
see O
the O
uplifted O
strap O
, O
nor O
was O
it O
till O
the O
blow O
|
     | O
had O
descended O
sharply O
on O
her O
arm O
that O
she O
was O
sufficiently O
mistress O
of O
her O
thoughts O
to O
|
     | O
remember O
, O
that O
there O
was O
at O
any O
rate O
a O
hope O
that O
it O
might O
be O
her O
turn O
next O
, O
and O
with O
this O
to O
|
     | O
comfort O
her O
, O
she O
yielded O
meekly O
to O
the O
arm O
that O
pushed O
her O
to O
her O
usual O
place O
, O
and O
resumed O
her O
|
     | O
occupation O
with O
more O
stedfast O
courage O
, O
than O
at O
that O
moment O
any O
other O
hope O
could O
have O
given O
|
     | O
her O
. O
| 
  | O
But O
even O
this O
sad O
hope O
proved O
vain O
. O
Fanny B-PERSON
Fletcher I-PERSON
still O
continued O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
very O
few O
upon O
|
     | O
whom O
the O
contagion O
had O
no O
effect O
. O
For O
the B-DATE
first I-DATE
day I-DATE
or O
two B-CARDINAL
after O
the O
removal O
of O
her O
friend O
, O
her O
|
     | O
mind O
, O
was O
almost O
wholly O
occupied O
by O
the O
expectation O
of O
feeling O
the O
same O
symptoms O
that O
she O
had O
|
     | O
witnessed O
in O
him O
  O
and O
when O
these O
came O
not O
, O
her O
thoughts O
reverted O
to O
the O
possibility O
of O
his O
|
     | O
recovering O
and O
coming O
again O
to O
work O
near O
her O
. O
| 
  | O
It O
was O
an O
established O
custom O
among O
those O
who O
alone O
could O
give O
information O
on O
the O
subject O
, O
|
     | O
never O
to O
permit O
any O
questionings O
concerning O
the O
sick O
, O
or O
if O
they O
were O
boldly O
hazarded O
, O
to O
give O
|
     | O
no O
other O
reply O
than O
a O
rebuke O
. O
So O
that O
day O
after O
day O
, O
and O
week B-DATE
after O
week B-DATE
elapsed O
, O
without O
her O
|
     | O
being O
at O
all O
able O
to O
guess O
, O
whether O
Michael B-PERSON
were O
dead O
or O
alive O
. O
By O
degrees O
, O
however O
, O
all O
hope O
|
     | O
of O
seeing O
him O
return O
, O
faded O
from O
her O
mind O
, O
and O
then O
, O
poor O
little O
girl O
, O
she O
found O
out O
that O
|
     | O
people O
ca O
n't O
always O
wish O
truly O
and O
really O
for O
what O
they O
know O
to O
be O
best O
either O
for O
themselves O
|
     | O
or O
others O
. O
And O
day O
by O
day O
, O
though O
still O
the O
fever O
touched O
her O
not O
, O
she O
grew O
more O
pale O
, O
more O
|
     | O
thin O
, O
more O
melancholy O
. O
Now O
and O
then O
, O
indeed O
, O
it O
still O
occurred O
to O
her O
as O
possible O
that O
Michael B-PERSON
|
     | O
might O
reappear O
again O
, O
as O
many O
had O
done O
after O
many B-DATE
days I-DATE
of O
sickness O
  O
but O
, O
alas O
! O
none O
had O
ever O
|
     | O
staid O
away O
so O
long O
as O
he O
had O
done O
! O
She O
had O
questioned O
many O
who O
had O
been O
ill O
concerning O
him O
, O
but O
|
     | O
none O
seemed O
to O
know O
or O
care O
any O
thing O
about O
those O
who O
had O
shared O
the O
sick O
chamber O
with O
them O
  O
|
     | O
till O
at O
length O
, O
a O
boy O
to O
whom O
she O
had O
often O
addressed O
these O
questions O
, O
because O
she O
happened O
to O
|
     | O
know O
that O
he O
had O
been O
taken O
to O
the O
sick O
ward O
on O
the B-DATE
same I-DATE
day I-DATE
as O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
replied O
as O
if O
by O
a O
|
     | O
sudden O
effort O
of O
recollection O
, O
| 
  | O
" O
Oh O

that O

Fanny B-PERSON

asked O
no O

" O
do O

you O
think O
that O
you O
will O
come O
at O
last O
to O

     | O
confess O
that O
I O
was O
right O
when O
I O
told O
you O
that O
you O
had O
better O
let O
things O
alone O
, O
and O
not O
attempt O

to O

any O

stir O
about O
these O
factory O
goings O

" O

  | O
Mary B-PERSON
looked O
sick O
at O
heart O
, O

only O
shook O
her O
head O
in O
reply O
. O

   | O
pains O
to O
get O
information O
, O
as O
you O
call O
it O
? O
You O
are O
looking O
as O
white O
as O
a O
sheet O
— O
|
     | O
your O
eyes O
are O
sunk O
in O
your O
head O
— O
when O
I O
look O
at O
you O
, O
instead O
of O
the O
smiles O
you O
used O
to O
give O
|
     | O
me O
, O
I O
get O
nothing O
but O
sighs O
, O
and O
all O
for O
what O
? O
Can O
you O
in O
honesty O
and O
truth O
say O
that O
you O
have O
|
     | O
gained O
any O
thing O
worth O
knowing O
by O
following O
your O
own O
opinion O
instead O
of O
mine O
? O
What O
good O
in O
the O
|
     | O
world O
can O
you O
do O
, O
dear O
, O
by O
listening O
to O
all O
the O
shocking O
stories O
that O
clergyman O
there O
told O
you O
? O
|
     | O
I O
dare O
say O
he O
is O
a O
very O
good O
man O
, O
and O
he O
looks O
like O
it O
, O
but O
upon O
my O
word O
I O
think O
he O
is O
doing O
|
     | O
nothing O
but O
just O
wasting O
his O
time O
, O
as O
well O
as O
yourself O
  O
for O
though O
I O
sat O
and O
said O
nothing O
, O
as O
|
     | O
of O
course O
it O
was O
my O
place O
to O
do O
, O
I O
listened O
to O
every O
word O
, O
and O
it O
is O
just O
because O
I O
believe O
|
     | O
every O
word O
was O
true O
, O
that O
common O
sense O
makes O
me O
see O
there O
's O
no O
good O
to O
talk O
about O
it O
. O
Indeed O
, O
|
     | O
and O
indeed O
, O
my O
darling O
, O
I O
would O
not O
make O
free O
to O
talk O
to O
you O
in O
this O
way O
, O
which O
looks O
for O
all O
|
     | O
the O
world O
as O
if O
I O
was O
taking O
advantage O
of O
your O
goodness O
to O
me O
, O
if O
I O
did O
not O
see O
that O
you O
was O
|
     | O
going O
the O
way O
to O
torment O
yourself O
for O
everlasting O
, O
without O
doing O
one B-CARDINAL
bit O
of O
good O
to O
any O
one O
. O
|
     | O
For O
how O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
can O
you O
, O
or O
that O
good O
clergyman O
either O
, O
hope O
to O
put O
down O
all O
the O
wicked O
|
     | O
doings O
he O
told O
about O
? O
And O
to O
be O
sure O
he O
said O
as O
much O
himself O
— O
did O
n't O
he O
Miss O
Mary B-PERSON
? O
Then O
do O
|
     | O
make O
up O
your O
mind O
to O
be O
quiet O
and O
happy O
, O
and O
let O
things O
that O
you O
ca O
n't O
mend O
, O
alone O
. O
Put O
as O
many O

     | O
children O
to O
school O
as O
you O
like O
, O
my O
dear O

and O
you O
may O
give O
them O
a O
pretty O
neat O
uniform O
, O
you O
know O
, O
|
     | O
and O
that O
will O
be O
a O
pleasure O
for O
you O
to O
think O
about O
, O
and O
to O
look O
at O
  O
but O
for O
pity O
's O
sake O
my O
|
     | O
dear O
, O
dear O
, O
child O
! O
give O
up O
at O
once O
, O
and O
for O
ever O
, O
this O
bothering O
yourself O
for O
everlasting O
about O

     | O
the O
factories O
, O
which O
you O
can O
no O
more O
stop O
, O

than O
you O
can O
stop O
the O
sun O
from O
rising O
in O
the B-TIME

     | I-TIME
morning I-TIME
, O
and O
setting O
at O
night B-TIME
. O
" O
|  
  | O
Here O
the O
good O
woman O
ceased O
, O
and O
looked O
with O
some O
anxiety O
in O
the O
thoughtful O
eyes O
of O
her O
young O
|
     | O
mistress O
. O
She O
felt O
that O
she O
did O
not O
understand O
their O
expression O
, O
and O
no O
wonder O
, O
for O
Mary B-PERSON
|
     | I-PERSON
Brotherton I-PERSON
herself O
sat O
silently O
doubting O
how O
she O
should O
answer O
her O
. O
A O
languid O
feeling O
, O
|
     | O
proceeding O
partly O
from O
fatigue O
and O
indisposition O
, O
and O
partly O
from O
the O
discouraging O
conviction O
|
     | O
that O
she O
had O
no O
very O
satisfactory O
arguments O
by O
which O
to O
rebut O
her O
old O
friend O
's O
charge O
of O
|
     | O
useless O
devotion O
to O
a O
hopless O
cause O
, O
made O
her O
for O
some B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
unwilling O
to O
speak O
at O
all O
. O
Then O
|
     | O
came O
a O
somewhat O
peevish O
wish O
to O
interdict O
for O
ever O
the O
discussion O
of O
the O
subject O
between O
them O
  O
|
     | O
but O
as O
she O
raised O
her O
eyes O
to O
utter O
it O
, O
she O
encountered O
a O
look O
of O
such O
humble O
love O
, O
deprecating O
|
     | O
her O
displeasure O
, O
yet O
fondly O
clinging O
to O
the O
freedom O
which O
risked O
the O
incuring O
it O
, O
that O
her O
|
     | O
purpose O
suddenly O
changed O
, O
and O
instead O
of O
the O
chilling O
command O
she O
was O
meditating O
, O
she O
threw O
her O
|
     | O
arms O
round O
the O
old O
woman O
's O
neck O
, O
exclaiming O
, O
| 
  | O
" O

! O
my O
dear O
nurse O

much O

harden O
such O

all O
the O

gentle O

I O

not O
long O

hard O

then O
by O
degrees O
you O
will O

     | O
find O
out O
that O
I O

right O

all O

go O
well O
again O

Nurse O

the O
time O

already O

the O
impossibility O

to O
stem O
the O
torrent O

which O

cruelty O
are O
overwhelming O
the O
land O

made O

     | O
evident O
to O

So O
much O
, O
dear O
nurse O

I O
concede O
to O
you O
, O

therefore O
on O
that O
point O
we O

no O

, O
my O
dear O

have O
patience O

me O

righteous O

I O
have O
been O
a O
vain O
self O
- O
sufficient O
old O
woman O
, O
my O
dear O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
and O
clearly O
have O
|
     | O
been O
talking O
a O
great O
deal O
about O
that O
of O
which O
I O
know O
nothing O
. O
Only O
do O
n't O
think O
I O
am O
cruel O
and O

     | O
hard O
- O
hearted O

though O
I O
do O

as O
you O
truly O
say O

though O
I O
do O
love O
you O
very O
very O
much O
indeed O
, O

     | O
I O
am O
not O
such O
a O
wretch O
as O
to O
hear O
all O
we O
were O
told O
to O
- O
day O
without O
wishing O
to O
mend O
it O

" O

  | O
This O
was O
the O
last O
time O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton I-PERSON
had O
to O
do O
battle O
with O
her O
nurse O
on O
the O
subject O
of O
the O
|
     | O
factory O
system O
. O
Once O
awakened O
to O
a O
sense O
of O
its O
tyranny O
and O
injustice O
, O
and O
made O
to O
feel O
that O
|
     | O
the O
only O
hope O
of O
remedy O
lay O
in O
the O
possibility O
of O
universally O
raising O
British B-NORP
feeling O
against O
|
     | O
it O
, O
there O
was O
no O
danger O
that O
the O
right O
- O
hearted O
old O
woman O
would O
ever O
again O
turn O
with O
|
     | O
indifference O
, O
weariness O
, O
or O
displeasure O
, O
from O
the O
theme O
. O
Her O
young O
mistress O
felt O
that O
she O
had O
|
     | O
touched O
the O
right O
string O
, O
and O
that O
she O
should O
never O
again O
have O
to O
fear O
discord O
where O
it O
was O
so O
|
     | O
essential O
to O
her O
comfort O
to O
find O
harmony O
. O
This O
change O
was O
really O
a O
comfort O
, O
and O
she O
felt O
it O
to O
|
     | O
be O
so O
, O
removing O
as O
it O
did O
one O
irksome O
feature O
from O
her O
situation O
, O
and O
for O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
it O
|
     | O
cheered O
her O
, O
and O
she O
said O
so O
, O
cordially O
, O
but O
the O
next O
, O
a O
pang O
shot O
to O
her O
heart O
, O
as O
she O
|
     | O
rememebered O
that O
this O
assurance O
of O
accordant O
counsels O
with O
her O
venerable O
nurse O
, O
could O
avail O
her O
|
     | O
nothing O
in O
the O
most O
painful O
of O
all O
her O
difficulties O
, O
for O
it O
promised O
no O
help O
either O
in O
|
     | O
obtaining O
light O
upon O
the O
mystery O
of O
poor O
Michael B-PERSON
's O
abode O
, O
or O
in O
the O
still O
more O
pressing O
|
     | O
embarrassment O
of O
confessing O
to O
his O
unhappy O
mother O
and O
brother O
the O
impossibility O
of O
obtaining O
|
     | O
it O
. O
Yet O
this O
painful O
task O
must O
be O
performed O
, O
and O
that O
without O
delay O
, O
for O
well O
she O
knew O
that O
|
     | O
every B-TIME
hour I-TIME
that O
passed O
without O
their O
seeing O
her O
, O
would O
be O
rendered O
dreadful O
, O
both O
by O
the O
agony O
|
     | O
of O
fear O
, O
and O
the O
sickening O
hot O
and O
cold O
fits O
of O
uncertainty O
. O
But O
never O
had O
she O
felt O
herself O
so O
|
     | O
very O
a O
coward O
as O
while O
meditating O
this O
visit O
of O
the O
morrow O
. O
She O
saw O
in O
imagination O
the O
eager O
|
     | O
questioning O
of O
Edward B-PERSON
's O
speaking O
eyes O
, O
and O
the O
heavy O
glance O
of O
his O
mother O
, O
anticipating O
the O
|
     | O
worst O
she O
had O
to O
tell O
. O
| 
  | O
Sometimes O
she O
thought O
she O
would O
await O
the O
coming O
of O
the O
boy O
to O
take O
his O
place O
in O
the O
school O
, O
|
     | O
and O
let O
him O
report O
the O
failure O
of O
all O
her O
inquiries O
to O
the O
poor O
widow O
. O
But O
there O
was O
a O
selfish O
|
     | O
cowardice O
in O
this O
which O
instantly O
struck O
her O
, O
and O
she O
seemed O
to O
hate O
herself O
for O
the O
|
     | O
suggestion O
. O
For O
above B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour I-TIME
after O
she O
had O
laid O
her O
head O
upon O
her O
pillow O
these O
thoughts O
kept O
|
     | O
her O
painfully O
awake O
, O
and O
it O
was O
only O
after O
deciding O
that O
she O
would O
once O
more O
see O
Martha B-PERSON
|
     | I-PERSON
Dowling I-PERSON
, O
and O
try O
the O
effect O
of O
repeating O
to O
her O
, O
but O
without O
quoting O
her O
authority O
, O
the O
dark O
|
     | O
hints O
she O
had O
listened O
to O
, O
respecting O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
's O
possible O
motives O
. O
It O
was O
only O
when O
her O
|
     | O
restless O
thoughts O
had O
fixed O
themselves O
on O
this O
, O
that O
she O
at O
length O
closed O
her O
aching O
eyes O
in O
|
     | O
sleep O
. O
| 
   | O
she O
wished O
for O
, O
without O
paying O
for O
it O
the O
penalty O
of O
such O
a O
visit O
. O
She O
wrote O
as O
|
     | O
follows O
: O
|  
  
  | O
" O
My O
dear O
Miss O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
trust O
you O
are O
too O
goodnatured O
to O
be O
angry O
with O
me O
, O
even O
if O
you O
should O
think O
that O
I O
am O
|
      | O
taking O
a O
great O
liberty O
with O
you O
. O
But O
the O
truth O
is O
, O
that O
I O
much O
wish O
for O
the O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
|
      | O
you O
, O
and O
yet O
am O
too O
idle O
this B-TIME
morning I-TIME
to O
venture O
upon O
a O
drive O
. O
Will O
you O
then O
have O
the O
great O
|
      | O
kindness O
to O
pass O
the B-TIME
morning I-TIME
with O
me O
here O
? O
I O
send O
my O
carriage O
, O
lest O
Lady B-PERSON
Dowling I-PERSON
should O
not O
|
      | O
have O
one O
at O
leisure O
to O
send O
with O
you O
. O
| 
   | O
" O
Believe O
me O
, O
my O
dear O
Miss O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
|  
  | O
" O
Yours B-WORK_OF_ART
very O
sincerely O
, O

Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton I-PERSON
. O
" O
|   
  | O
Having O
written O
, O
folded O
, O
and O
sealed O
this O
epistle O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
recollected O
that O
it O
would O
be O
impossible O
|
     | O
to O
send O
it O
for O
at B-TIME
least I-TIME
four I-TIME
hours I-TIME
, O
and O
she O
smiled O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
and O
then O
sighed O
, O
as O
she O
thought O
of O
|
     | O
the O
restless O
but O
useless O
activity O
which O
had O
caused O
her O
so O
needlessly O
to O
forestall O
her O
usual B-TIME
|
     | I-TIME
hour I-TIME
of O
rising O
. O
It O
would O
, O
in O
truth O
, O
have O
been O
better O
for O
her O
, O
poor O
girl O
, O
could O
she O
have O
slept O
|
     | O
through O
the O
time O
, O
for O
her O
waking O
thoughts O
had O
little O
that O
was O
pleasant O
to O
rest O
upon O
. O
Even O
the O
|
     | O
commencement O
of O
Edward B-PERSON
's O
studies O
, O
to O
which O
she O
had O
before O
looked O
forward O
with O
great O
delight O
, O
|
     | O
now O
recurred O
to O
her O
only O
to O
bring O
the O
recollection O
that O
if O
she O
saw O
him O
, O
his O
thoughts O
would O
be O
|
     | O
neither O
of O
his O
new O
clothes O
nor O
his O
new O
books O
, O
but O
of O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
and O
of O
her O
promise O
to O
get O
tidings O
|
     | O
of O
him O
. O
For O
his O
sake O
, O
and O
her O
own O
too O
, O
she O
determined O
at O
least O
to O
escape O
this O
interview O
, O
|
     | O
feeling O
that O
it O
would O
be O
better O
for O
all O
parties O
that O
no O
tidings O
should O
be O
delivered O
to O
both O
|
     | O
mother O
and O
son O
at O
once O
, O
which O
could O
be O
done O
after O
his B-TIME
school I-TIME
hours I-TIME
, O
by O
her O
driving O
to O
|
     | O
Hoxley B-ORG
- O
lane O
, O
after O
she O
had O
taken O
Martha B-PERSON
home O
. O
| 
  | O
In O
pursuance O
of O
this O
resolution O
, O
she O
walked O
to O
the O
school O
- O
house O
, O
renewed O
her O
orders O
that O
the O
|
     | O
greatest O
attention O
should O
be O
paid O
to O
the O
new O
scholar O
, O
Edward B-PERSON
Armstrong I-PERSON
, O
and O
care O
taken O
that O
if O

     | O
he O
were O
found O
backward O
for O
his O
age O
, O
he O
should O
neither O
be O
laughed O
at O
nor O
chid O
. O
She O
then O
left O
a O
|
     | O
message O
for O
him O
, O
stating O
that O
she O
should O
be O
engaged O
all O
the O
morning O
, O
but O
would O
see O
him O
at O
his O
|
     | O
mother O
's O
house O
, O
after O
he O
left O
school O
. O
| 
  | O
At O
eleven B-TIME
o'clock I-TIME
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
's O
equipage O
set O
off O
for O
Dowlinglodge B-ORG
, O
bearing O
her O
letter O
to O
|
     | O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
and O
the O
interval O
till O
its O
return O
was O
an O
anxious O
one O
. O
First B-ORDINAL
she O
felt O
doubtful O
if O
her O
|
     | O
unusual O
invitation O
would O
be O
accepted O
  O
and O
if O
it O
were O
, O
she O
felt O
more O
doubtful O
still O
as O
to O
the O
|
     | O
nature O
of O
the O
scene O
which O
must O
follow O
. O
Nothing O
short O
of O
her O
earnest O
wish O
to O
redeem O
her O
promise O
|
     | O
to O
Mrs. O
Armstrong B-PERSON
could O
have O
given O
Mary B-PERSON
courage O
to O
do O
what O
she O
now O
meditated O
. O
| 
   | O
her O
father O
, O
the O
tremendous O
effect O
of O
which O
upon O
her O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
had O
already O
witnessed O
, O
|
     | O
was O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
very O
last O
measures O
she O
could O
have O
been O
led O
to O
adopt O
. O
But O
a O
strong O
and O
stern O
|
     | O
feeling O
of O
justice O
, O
urged O
her O
not O
to O
shrink O
from O
this O
. O
It O
was O
evident O
from O
the O
statement O
of O
|
     | O
Mrs. O
Armstrong B-PERSON
that O
Martha B-PERSON
had O
been O
actively O
instrumental O
in O
sending O
Michael B-PERSON
to O
his O
present O
|
     | O
destination O
, O
let O
it O
be O
where O
it O
might O
  O
and O
painful O
or O
not O
painful O
, O
it O
was O
unquestionably O
right O
|
     | O
to O
make O
her O
understand O
the O
doubts O
that O
existed O
as O
to O
the O
boy O
's O
well O
- O
being O
, O
in O
order O
that O
she O

     | O
might O
avail O
herself O
, O
as O
she O
was O
bound O
to O
do O
, O
of O
her O
access O
to O
the O
only O
person O
who O
could O
explain O
|
     | O
the O
transaction O
. O
|  
  | O
Having O
screwed O
her O
courage O
, O
therefore O
, O
to O
the O
strictness O
of O
examination O
necessary O
to O
her O
most O
|
     | O
righteous O
purpose O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
left O
her O
boudoir O
in O
the O
possession O
of O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
, O
and O
repaired O
to O
|
     | O
the O
library O
to O
await O
her O
guest O
. O
Nor O
did O
she O
wait O
long O
. O
Almost O
before O
the O
time O
arrived O
at O
which O
|
     | O
she O
had O
calculated O
that O
the O
carriage O
might O
return O
, O
the O
great O
house O
- O
bell O
gave O
signal O
of O
a O
|
     | O
visiter O
, O
and O
the O
next O
moment O
Martha B-PERSON
Dowling I-PERSON
stood O
before O
her O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
two B-CARDINAL
young O
girls O
shook O
hands O
, O
and O
each O
observed O
that O
the O
other O
looked O
paler O
than O
she O
was O
|
     | O
wo O
nt O
to O
do O
. O
The O
heart O
of O
Mary B-PERSON
sank O
within O
her O
as O
she O
marked O
the O
expression O
of O
Martha B-PERSON
's O
|
     | O
countenance O
. O
Not O
only O
was O
it O
pale O
, O
but O
most O
speakingly O
anxious O
, O
and O
in O
addition O
to O
her O
usual O
|
     | O
shy O
and O
reserved O
manner O
there O
was O
an O
appearance O
of O
uneasiness O
, O
and O
almost O
of O
fear O
, O
as O
she O
|
     | O
thought O
, O
which O
seemed O
to O

her O
object O

suspected O

Nor O
was O
she O
wrong O

In O
pursuance O
of O
|
     | O
a O
promise O
given O
to O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
Martha B-PERSON
had O
visited O
the O
widow O
Armstrong B-PERSON
, O
and O
the O
intense O
anxiety O
|
     | O
under O
which O
she O
found O
her O
suffering O
respecting O
the O
destination O
of O
her O
boy O
, O
awakened O
for O
the O
|
     | O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
in O
her O
own O
mind O
a O
shadowy O
suspicion O
that O
all O
might O
not O
be O
right O
concerning O
him O
. O
The O
|
     | O
pang O
this O
cost O
her O
was O
terrible O
. O
Good O
and O
kind O
- O
hearted O
as O
she O
was O
, O
there O
was O
no O
strength O
of O
|
     | O
fibre O
in O
Martha B-PERSON
's O
character O
which O
might O
enable O
her O
to O
brave O
every O
thing O
rather O
than O
remain O
in O
|
     | O
doubt O
. O
She O
loved O
her O
father O
fondly O
, O
but O
she O
feared O
him O
more O
, O
and O
the O
stronger O
her O
suspicions O
|
     | O
grew O
( O
and O
unhappily O
the O
more O
she O
meditated O
the O
more O
they O
strengthened O
) O
, O
the O
less O
power O
she O
felt O

     | O
either O
to O
refute O
or O
confirm O
them O
. O

The O
note O
of O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
was O
delivered O
to O
her O
at O
the O
family O
breakfast O
table O
, O
and O
the O
|
     | O
instant O
she O
read O
it O
, O
the O
truth O
suggested O
itself O
to O
her O
mind O
. O
Had O
she O
been O
a O
free O
agent O
, O
the O
|
     | O
wounded O
shrinking O
spirit O
of O
the O
poor O
girl O
would O
have O
certainly O
led O
her O
to O
invent O
some O
excuse O
|
     | O
for O
refusing O
an O
invitation O
so O
full O
of O
terror O
  O
but O
she O
was O
not O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
What O
's O
that O
about O
, O
Martha B-PERSON
? O
" O
said O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
, O
holding O
out O
his O
hand O
for O
the O
note O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
It O
is O
from O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
, O
" O
muttered O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
as O
she O
resigned O
it O
to O
him O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Mercy O
on O
me O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
her O
eldest O
sister O
, O
" O
what O
a O
wonderful O
fancy O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
seems O
to O

     | O
have O
taken O
for O
Martha B-PERSON
! O
I O
do O
think O
it O
is O
the O
very O
oddest O
thing O
I O
ever O
heard O
of O
. O
" O

  | O
" O
What O
a O
goose O
you O
are O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
not O
to O

it O
! O
" O
observed O
Miss B-PERSON
Harriet I-PERSON
, O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
|
     | O
sister O
, O
giving O
at O
the O
same O
time O
a O
very O
significant O
glance O
towards O
her O
brother O
Augustus B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
" O
But O
good O
gracious O
! O
" O
retorted O
Miss O
Arabella B-PERSON
, O
why O
might O
not O
any O
other O
of O
us O
do O
as O
well O
? O
It O
|
     | O
would O
seem O
so O
much O
more O
natural O
in O
such O
an O
elegant O
and O
fashionable O
girl O
as O
she O
is O
. O
" O

  | O
" O
She O
is O
afraid O
of O
us O
, O
Bella B-PERSON
, O
" O
replied O
Miss O
Harriet B-PERSON
, O
tittering O
. O
| 
  | O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
not O
only O
read O
the O
note O
, O
but O
contrived O
to O
hear O
all O
that O
his O
two B-CARDINAL
eldest O
|
     | O
daughters O
said O
concerning O
it O
, O
here O
burst O
into O
a O
laugh O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Set O

said O
poor O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
turning O
very O
pale O
. O

  | O
" O
Must O
you O

with O
that O

away O

too O

Why O
, O
Martha B-PERSON
! O
are O
you O
jealous O
, O
because O
some O

     | O
folks O
fancy O
that O
the O
young O
lady O
wants O
to O
make O
friends O
with O
you O

for O
more O

" O

" O
I O
would O
a O
great O
deal O
rather O
not O
go O

papa O

" O
replied O
Martha B-PERSON
in O
a O
beseeching O
accent O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Martha B-PERSON
! O
I O
shall O
be O
in O
a O
downright O
passion O
with O
you O

half B-TIME
a I-TIME

Upon O
my O
honour O
I O
never O

     | O
heard O
any O

unsisterly O
in O
my O
life O

Go O
this O
moment O

get O
on O
your O

     | O
bonnet O

and O
remember O
if O
you O
please O
, O
from O
first B-ORDINAL
to O
last O
, O
to O
speak O
of O
your O
brother O
as O
a O
sister O

     | O
ought O
to O
speak O
. O
And O
if O
she O
hints O
any O
thing O
about O
his O
having O
flirted O
a O
little O
with O
Carry B-ORG

     | I-ORG
Thompson I-ORG
, O
be O
sure O
to O
say O
that O
he O
only O
did O
it O
to O
laugh O
at O
her O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
As O
he O
spoke O
these O
words O
, O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
rose O
from O
the O
table O
, O
as O
if O
to O
accelerate O
the O
movement O
|
     | O
which O
was O
to O
send O
her O
off O
. O
| 
  | O
Martha B-PERSON
listened O
to O
him O
with O
the O
habitual O
reverence O
which O
she O
ever O
bestowed O
on O
all O
he O
uttered O
  O
|
     | O
but O
shook O
her O
head O
, O
as O
it O
seemed O
, O
involuntarily O
, O
as O
he O
concluded O
. O

  | O
" O
Why O
you O
do O

mean O
to O
say O

you O
good O

nothing O
spiteful O
girl O
! O
" O
cried O
Lady B-PERSON
|
     | I-PERSON
Dowling I-PERSON
, O
suddenly O
rousing O
herself O
from O
the O
dignified O
apathy O
in O
which O
she O
usually O
indulged O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
What O
a O
shame O
! O
" O
cried O
one B-CARDINAL
sister O
. O

  | O
" O
That O
's O
too O
bad O
! O
" O
cried O
the O
other O
. O

  | O
" O
Just O
like O
her O
, O
though O

sneered O
Mr. O
Augustus B-PERSON

| 
  | O
" O
Hold O
your O
tongues O
, O
all O
of O
you O

said O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON

Thus O
urged O

thus O
goaded O
to O
the O
interview O
she O
dreaded O
, O
Martha B-PERSON
hastened O
to O
leave O
the O
room O
  O

|
     | O
ere O
she O
passed O
the O
door O
, O
something O
at O
her O
heart O
told O
her O
that O
her O
best O
course O
would O
be O
to O
take O

     | O
her O
father O
apart O

tell O
him O
all O
. O
She O
turned O
back O
to O
look O
at O
him O
, O
but O
met O
a O
frown O
so O
strongly O
|
     | O
indicative O
of O
growing O
impatience O
at O
her O
delay O
, O
that O
yielding O
to O
the O
sort O
of O
slavish O
feeling O
in O

     | O
which O
she O
had O
been O
nurtured O

she O
hurried O
forward O
to O
obey O
him O

Had O
she O
possessed O
greater O
moral O

     | O
courage O
, O
many O
subsequent O
events O
would O
have O
been O
different O

capable O

her O
companion O

begged O
her O
to O
sit O
down O

then O
, O
placing O
herself O

     | O
where O
she O
could O
have O

as O
a O
commentary O
on O
what O
she O
might O
induce O
her O
to O
say O
, O
the O
advantage O
of O

     | O
watching O
her O
countenance O

pronounced O
in O

vain O

     | O
" O
My O

Martha B-PERSON

to O

satisfy O
her O

that O

nothing O

in O

heiress O

, O
unfortunately O

succeeded O

Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
, O
meanwhile O
, O
mounted O
a O
little O
pony O
phaeton O
with O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
, O
and O
with O
a O
|
     | O
heavy O
heart O
proceeded O
to O
Hoxley B-ORG
- O
lane O
. O
But O
, O
painful O
as O
was O
her O
errand O
, O
her O
condition O
was O
a O
far O
|
     | O
happier O
one O
than O
that O
of O
Martha B-PERSON
Dowling I-PERSON
  O
for O
in O
her O
there O
was O
no O
mixture O
of O
motives O
to O
paralyze O
|
     | O
every O
word O
and O
act O
. O
Her O
kind O
heart O
sought O
and O
found O
counsel O
in O
her O
sound O
and O
upright O
judgment O
, O
|
     | O
and O
, O
sustained O
by O
it O
, O
she O
executed O
her O
task O
without O
shrinking O
. O
A O
little O
reflection O
on O
the O
|
     | O
subject O
convinced O
her O
that O
it O
was O
now O
become O
her O
duty O
to O
confess O
to O
her O
poor O
client O
, O
not O
only O
|
     | O
that O
her O
exertions O
to O
discover O
the O
abode O
of O
Michael B-PERSON
had O
been O
unsuccessful O
, O
but O
that O
she O
began O
|
     | O
to O
fear O
that O
there O
must O
be O
some O
unpleasant O
reason O
for O
the O
difficulties O
thrown O
in O
the O
way O
of O
|
     | O
obtaining O
the O
information O
she O
had O
sought O
. O
It O
required O
some O
courage O
to O
utter O
this O
  O
but O
when O
it O
|
     | O
wasdone O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
was O
surprised O
to O
perceive O
that O
its O
effect O
, O
both O
upon O
the O
mother O
and O
son O
was O
very O
|
     | O
trifling O
. O
Having O
candidly O
stated O
her O
fears O
, O
she O
remained O
silent O
, O
the O
eyes O
of O
both O
being O
fixed O
|
     | O
upon O
her O
with O
a O
sort O
of O
quiet O
hopelessness O
that O
was O
perhaps O
more O
painful O
to O
contemplate O
than O
|
     | O
more O
vehement O
demonstrations O
of O
grief O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Our O
thanks O
are O
not O
the O
less O
due O
to O
you O
, O
ma'am O
, O
" O
said O
the O
widow O
gently O
, O
" O
and O
do O
n't O
vex O
your O

     | O
kind O
heart O
by O
thinking O
that O
we O
are O
disappointed O
. O
Edward B-PERSON
and O
I O
guessed O
true O
from O
almost O
the O
|
     | O
first B-ORDINAL
  O
that O
is O
, O
from O
when O

was O
taken O
off O

Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
is O
known O
|
     | O
better O
by O
his O
mill O
people O
, O
ma'am O

than O
by O
the O
great O
gentry O
that O
turns O
their O
eyes O
away O
from O

     | O
labour O

sorrow O

to O
revel O

grow O
fat O
upon O
our O
graves O

You O
would O
never O
be O
like O
to O
hear O
the O

     | O
truth O
from O
them O
, O

I O
am O
told O
that O
even O
now O

the O
country O
round O
rings O
with O
praises O
of O
Sir O

goodness O

Michael B-PERSON

bitter O

it O
is O
God O

will O
our O
portion O
should O

     | O
be O
bitter O
here O

He O
has O
power O

make O
it O
up O
to O
us O
hereafter O
, O

it O
is O
there O

fix O
our O

should O

Tell O
me O
, O
Edward B-PERSON

how O
did O
you O
get O
on O

day O

" O

  | O
" O
Every O

was O
kind O

answered O
the O

" O
That O

" O

" O
He O
does O
indeed O

ma'am O
! O

I O
could O
almost O
fancy O
that O
he O
looked O
better O

health O
already O

     | O
having O
left O

replied O
the O
widow O

" O
And O
I O
feel O
better O

said O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
looking O
at O
his O
mother O

his O
soft O
thoughtful O
eyes O

" O

I O

     | O
do O

think O
that O

" O

" O
My O
boy O

my O
boy O

cried O
the O
poor O
cripple O
, O
raising O
herself O
in O
her O
bed O
, O
and O
throwing O
her O
arms O

around O
him O

" O
Should O
I O
dare O
to O
complain O

any O
thing O

But O
oh O
! O
Teddy B-PERSON
! O

     | O
would O
n't O
he O
have O
given O
one B-CARDINAL

his O
little O
hands O

see O
it O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
This O
appeal O
, O
which O
in O
truth O
only O
echoed O
the O
thoughts O
of O
his O
own O
heart O
, O
overthrew O
all O
the O
|
     | O
courage O
of O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
and O
his O
tears O
again O
flowed O
as O
fast O
as O
those O
of O
his O
poor O
mother O
  O
a O
renewal O
of O

     | O
weakness O
of O
which O
they O
might O
both O
have O
been O
still O
more O
ashamed O
than O
they O
were O

they O
not O

     | O
perceived O
that O
neither O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON

her O
old O
friend O
had O
dry O
eyes O

  | O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
however O

was O
too O
wise O

let O
this O
last O

" O
This O
dear O
boy O

has O
said O
that O

us O
all O
courage O

I O
can O
hardly O

     | O
tell O
you O
the O
delightful O
feeling O
which O
the O
hope O
of O
his O
restoration O
to O
health O
would O
give O
me O
. O
It O

     | O
would O
repay O
me O
a B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
fold O
for O
all O
the O
pain O
I O
have O
suffered O

Let O
us O
fix O
our O
thoughts O
on O

     | O
this O
hope O

and O
trust O
me O
it O
shall O
be O
realized O

if O
medical O
skill O

kind O
treatment O

it O

" O

It O
was O
with O
this O
assurance O
she O
left O
them O

if O
any O
earthly O
promise O
could O
have O
healed O
the O

anguish O
of O
the O
mother O

heart O

it O
would O
have O
been O
this O

But O
her O
two B-CARDINAL
children O
were O
so O
twined O
and O
|
     | O
twisted O
together O
in O
her O
thoughts O
, O
that O
meditating O
upon O
her O
hopes O
for O
Edward B-PERSON
inevitably O
brought O

     | O
her O
terrors O
for O
Michael B-PERSON
before O
her O
, O
and O
it O
was O
but O
with O
a O
fitful O
sort O
of O
satisfaction O
that O
the O

     | O
boy O
dwelt O
upon O
his O
anticipations O
of O
being O
useful O
to O
her O

that O
she O
listened O
to O
him O

Two B-DATE
days I-DATE
after O
this O
, O
while O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON

Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
were O
pursuing O
their O
usual O

     | O
morning O
occupations O
in O
the O
boudoir O

a O
servant O
announced O
that O
a O
lady O

gentleman O
were O
in O
the O

     | O
drawing O

room O

Had O
the O
announcement O
been O
of O
a O
gentleman O
alone O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
thoughts O
would O
have O
instantly O

     | O
suggested O
Mr. O
Bell B-PERSON

for O
they O

the O

his O
coming O

through O
both O

     | O
the B-DATE
preceding I-DATE
days I-DATE
. O
But O
the O
mention O
of O
the O
lady O
puzzled O
her O
. O
Nevertheless O
the O
gentleman O
was O
Mr. O

     | O
Bell B-ORG
, O
and O
no O
other O

the O
frank O

simple O
kindness O
with O
which O
he O
said O

he O
led O
the O
lady O

forward O

rendered O
the O

introduction O

take O
this O
good O
little O
woman O
into O
the O

probably O
more O

     | O
practical O
knowledge O

Equally O
cordial O

sincere O
was O
the O
welcome O
Mary B-PERSON
gave O
to O

new O

deep O
importance O

have O

     | O
sufficed O
to O
make O
them O
happy O

the B-TIME
long I-TIME
morning I-TIME
they O
passed O
together O
would O
have O
been O
one O
of O
great O

enjoyment O

they O
were O
all O
too O
much O
in O
earnest O
to O
be O
called O
happy O

dwelling O
upon O
the O

     | O
frightful O
subject O
to O
which O
their O
thoughts O
were O
turned O

The O
longer O
Mary B-PERSON
listened O
to O
those O
whose O

     | O
lives O
were O
past O
in O
struggling O
to O
assuage O
the O
misery O
around O
them O
, O
and O
in O
battling O
with O
the O

     | O
horrid O
principles O
which O
produced O
it O
, O
the O
more O
deeply O
did O
she O
feel O
that O
she O

was O
called O

     | O
upon O
to O
labour O
in O
the O

thorny O
vineyard O

Yet O
terrible O
as O
were O
the O
subjects O
they O
discussed O
, O
|
     | O
and O
sad O
as O
was O
the O
conviction O
that O
no O
power O
less O
mighty O
than O
that O
of O
the O
law O
could O
redress O
the O

evils O
they O
deplored O

there O
was O
still O
something O
inexpressibly O
soothing O
to O
her O
feelings O

in O

finding O
herself O
thus O
in O
intimate O
relation O

persons O

comprehended O

shared O
in O
the O

sentiments O

had O
become O
so O
essentially O
a O
part O

told O

from O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
moment O
her O
attention O
had O
been O
called O
to O
the O
subject O

that O
it O
was O
her O
duty O

not O
to O
turn O
away O
from O
it O

had O
hitherto O
met O
little O

opposition O
from O
those O
around O
her O

     | O
though O
steadfast O

firm O
in O
purpose O

she O
had O
often O
felt O
heavy O
in O
spirit O
from O
knowing O
herself O

to O
be O
alone O

she O
so O
much O

could O
never O

from O
again O

long O

within O

fervently O

Mr. O

thence O

farewell O
visit O

here O
it O
was O
evident O

discreetly O
silent O
concerning O
them O

for O
after O

gratuity O

  | O
To O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
whom O
she O
visited O
at O
the O
school O
, O
she O
gave O
the O
same O
assurance O
, O
adding O
an O
earnest O
|
     | O
injunction O
that O
he O
should O
keep O
in O
mind O
the O
necessity O
of O
exerting O
himself O
, O
both O
for O
the O
|
     | O
industrious O
prosecution O
of O
his O
studies O

and O
the O
not O

important O
regulation O
of O
his O
mind O
on O

     | O
the O
subject O
of O
his O
brother O
's O
absence O

the O
welfare O
of O
his O
mother O
greatly O
depending O
upon O
both O
. O

     | O
Weakness O
of O
every O
kind O
seemed O
to O
vanish O
before O
the O
powerful O
stimulant O
thus O
offered O
, O
and O
she O
|
     | O
left O
her O
little O
protégé O
comforted O
and O
invigorated O
by O
the O
belief O
that O
he O
had O
a O
great O
duty O
to O
|
     | O
perform O
, O
and O
that O
his O
mother O
was O
the O
object O
of O
it O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
preparations O
for O
her O
own O
and O
her O
friends O
' O
convenience O
during O
the O
journey O
were O
very O
|
     | O
simple O
, O
but O
they O
puzzled O
her O
maid O
considerably O
. O
First B-ORDINAL
, O
it O
was O
so O
very O
odd O
that O
she O
should O
be O
|
     | O
going O
out O
upon O
a O
visit O
and O
take O
absolutely O
no O
dinner O
dresses O
at O
all O
with O
her O
  O
and O
secondly B-ORDINAL
, O
it O
|
     | O
was O
, O
if O
possible O
, O
odder O
still O
, O
that O
she O
should O
not O
take O
her O
. O
But O
Mary B-PERSON
listened O
to O
all O
the O
hints O
|
     | O
and O
innuendoes O
to O
which O
these O
feelings O
gave O
rise O
with O
a O
sort O
of O
gentle O
indifference O
, O
which O
was O
|
     | O
doubtless O
very O
provoking O
, O
till O
at O
length O
she O
was O
induced O
to O
damp O
the O
curiosity O
, O
which O
she O
|
     | O
feared O
might O
prove O
inconveniently O
active O
during O
her O
absence O
, O
by O
saying O
, O
" O
I O
am O
going O
to O
visit O
|
     | O
the O
family O
of O
a O
clergyman O

Morgan B-ORG

shall O
not O
want O

you O

  | O
This O
was O
perfectly O
satisfactory O
. O
" O
A O
clergyman O

family O
, O
where O
much O
dress O
would O
not O

     | O
necessary O
, O
was O
where O
the O
lady O

maid O
never O

never O
could O
want O
to O
go O

Nothing O
could O
have O
been O
more O
judicious O
than O
these O
explanatory O
words O
. O
They O
accorded O
perfectly O

     | O
with O
the O
report O
of O
the O
servants O
who O
attended O
the O
carriage O
, O
and O
so O
completely O
satisfied O

     | O
household O

that O
, O
though O
it O
was O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
absence O
of O
so O
long O
duration O
that O
she O
had O
made O
from O
her O

     | O
home O
since O
she O
became O
mistress O
of O

fortunately O
led O

no O
gossipings O

We O
must O
not O
pause O

describe O
the O
pleasant O

evening B-TIME

on O

     | O
Mr. O
Bell B-PERSON
gave O
them O
a O
silent O
blessing O
and O
a O
silent O
nod O
  O
the O
horseboy B-NORP
vociferated O
" O
all O
right O
, O
" O
|
     | O
and O
the O
richest O
young O
lady O
in O
Lancashirc O
rolled O
off O
, O
very O
literally O
in O
search O
of O
|
     | O
adventures O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
novelty O
of O
her O
situation O
, O
and O
of O
her O
sensations O
of O
every O
kind O
, O
the O
unceremonious O
|
     | O
examination O
bestowed O
upon O
her O
by O
a O
smart O
young O
clerk O
who O
sat O
opposite O
, O
the O
anxious O
look O
of O
Mrs. O
|
     | O
Tremlett B-PERSON
's O
usually O
tranquil O
face O
, O
and O
the O
consciousness O
that O
the O
enterprise O
she O
was O
upon O
must O
|
     | O
even O
by O
herself O
be O
characterized O
as O
wildly O
extravagant O
, O
if O
not O
carried O
through O
with O
much O
steady O
|
     | O
courage O
and O
discretion O
, O
altogether O
produced O
a O
feeling O
of O
oppression O
on O
her O
heart O
that O
very O
|
     | O
nearly O
overcame O
her O
. O
" O
Am O
I O
acting O
rightly O
in O
thus O
exposing O
myself O
? O
" O
was O
the O
question O
that O
her O
|
     | O
startled O
nerves O
suggested O
: O
and O
had O
her O
conscience O
been O
unable O
to O
answer O
it O
boldly O
and O
promptly O
, O
|
     | O
her O
condition O
would O
have O
been O
really O
pitiable O
. O
Happily O
, O
however O
, O
this O
was O
not O
the O
case O
. O
There O
|
     | O
was O
some O
feminine O
timidity O
about O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton I-PERSON
, O
but O
not O
an O
atom O
of O
false O
shame O
or O
affectation O
|
     | O
of O
any O
kind O
. O
" O
Yes O
! O
— O
I O
am O
right O
! O
" O
was O
the O
answer O
recorded O
on O
her O
heart O
of O
hearts O
, O
" O
and O
shame O
to O
|
     | O
me O
if O
I O
shrink O
at O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
step O
, O
for O
no O
better O
reason O
than O
because O
the O
dust O
flies O
, O
and O
a O
|
     | O
vulgar O
young O
man O
stares O
me O
in O
the O
face O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
From O
that O
moment O
Mary B-PERSON
recoiled O
no O
more O
  O
and O
a O
little O
resolute O
meditation O
on O
her O
object O
, O
and O
|
     | O
of O
the O
strength O
demanded O
to O
obtain O
it O
, O
so O
effectually O
restored O
her O
usual O
self O
- O
possession O
, O
that O
|
     | O
she O
looked O
round O
upon O
her O
fellow O
- O
travellers O
with O
as O
little O
embarrassment O
as O
if O
she O
had O
been O
|
     | O
used O
to O
travel O
in O
public O
all O
her O
life O
, O
nodded O
to O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
with O
an O
encouraging O
smile O
, O
and O
|
     | O
thought O
how O
very O
silly O
people O
were O
who O
fancied O
that O
every O
thing O
unusual O
must O
of O
necessity O
be O
|
     | O
terrible O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Are O
you O
going O
all O
the O
way O
to O
— O
, O
miss O
? O
" O
said O
a O
goodnatured O
- O
looking O
woman O
who O
sat O

        | O
bodkin O

between O
the O
smart O
clerk O

Mrs. O

| 
  | O
" O
Yes O
, O
ma'am O
, O
I O
am O

replied O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
civilly O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
good O
- O
natured O
woman O
twisted O
herself O
round O
to O
reconnoitre O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON

" O
Your O
mamma O

Mary B-PERSON
bowed O
— O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
smiled O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
goodnatured O
- O
looking O
woman O
persevered O
in O
the O
same O
train O
of O
pertinent O
observation O
, O
|
     | O
sometimes O
addressed O
to O
one B-CARDINAL
passenger O
, O
and O
sometimes O
to O
another O
, O
so O
as O
to O
prevent O
the O
party O
from O
|
     | O
sinking O
into O
total O
silence O
, O
which O
might O
otherwise O
, O
perhaps O
, O
have O
happened O
. O
But O
Mary B-PERSON
bore I-PERSON
her I-PERSON

     | O
share O
in O
this O
trifling O
annoyance O
with O
perfect O
good O
- O
humour O
  O
and O
when O
at O
length O
they O
arrived O
at O
— O
|
     | O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
asked O
her O
in O
rather O
piteous O
accents O
, O
the O
moment O
they O
were O
alone O
together O
, O
|
     | O
whether O
she O
did O
not O
feel O
dreadfully O
worn O
out O
, O
she O
cheerfully O
replied O
, O

" O
Not O
the O
least O

dear O

" O

the O
old O
woman O

fervently O

" O
As O
we O
did O
yesterday B-DATE

merely O

" O
Probably O
not O

was O
the O
answer O

in O
that O

" O
You O
are O
really O
in O

, O
Miss O

" O
rejoined O
her O
friend O
in O
an O
accent O

betrayed O

some O
nervousness O

" O
You O
really O

Most O

Miss O

gravely O

" O
Did O
you O
suppose O

jesting O

in O
what O
I O
then O

" O
Not O

Miss O

— O
No O
, O
certainly O
, O
not O
jesting O

Only O
I O
thought O
that O
may O
be O
after O
a O

     | O
little O
more O
thinking O
about O
it O
you O
might O
change O
your O

" O
You O

with O
vexation O

" O
You O
do O
not O

" O

not O

the O
old O
woman O
with O
emotion O

" O
I O

I O
love O
you O
a O
thousand O

better O

ever O
I O
did O

that O
is O
just O
because O
I O
do O
understand O

you O
  O
only O
I O

courage O

" O
We O
shall O
see O

nurse O
Tremlett B-PERSON

Courage O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
often O
depends O
more O
upon O
the O
earnestness O

     | O
the O
will O
than O
the O
strength O
of O
the O
nerves O

  | O
Their O
attempt O
to O
get O
admittance O
to O
the O
apprentice O

as O
they O
both O
expected O

     | O
abortive O

were O
told O

nothing O
such O
to O

they O
retreated O
as O
they O

advanced O

somewhat O
fearful O

their O

     | O

The O
distance O

considerably O
greater O

had O
little O
more O
time O

     | O
on O
their O
return O

sufficed O

his O
words O

Miss O

I O
could O
quite O
swear O

it O

I O

it O

me O

, O
my O

tell O
me O
truly O

I O

settled O
last B-TIME

down O

But O
, O
after O
I O
went O
to O

it O
struck O
me O
that O
it O
would O
be O
surely O
better O
to O
begin O
with O
the O

     | O
place O
pointed O
out O
by O
our O
good O

the O
most O

I O
like O
the O
business O

     | O
quite O
as O
little O
as O
you O
do O

would O
gladly O
shorten O
it O

if O
possible O

" O

" O
But O
, O
my O
dear O

wo O
n't O
the O
stage O
we O
are O
going O
in O
take O
us O
the O
wrong O
way O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
A O
little O
round O
about O
— O
but O
I O
see O
no O
objection O
in O
that O
  O
we O
have O
no O
particular O
wish O
, O
you O
know O

our O

direction O
, O
when O
our O
purpose O
is O
to O
take O

     | O
another O

must O
go O
far O
towards O

Mary B-PERSON

quite O
correct O

Their O
driver O
, O

soon O
drew O

up O

upon O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON

inquiring O
if O

courageously O

giving O
her O

an O
encouraging O
smile O

preceded O

into O

smelt O
strongly O
of O
tobacco O

sitting O

the O
meek O
- O
spirited O
Mrs. O

, O
half B-CARDINAL

     | O
frightened O
by O
the O

look O

" O
What O

this O

not O
good O
enough O

I O
suppose O

you O
may O
trudge O
— O
it O
is O
good O
enough O
for O
your O

     | O
betters O

replied O
the O
woman O
, O
looking O
most O
alarmingly O
sulky O
. O

the O
last O
been O
addressed O
to O

     | O
herself O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton I-PERSON
would O
have O
thought O
it O
one O
of O
the O
duties O
imposed O
by O
her O
pilgrimage O
to O

, O
as O
it O
was O
, O
she O
slipped O
out O
of O
the O
dungeon O
- O
parlour O
with O
great O
celerity O
, O
and O
|
     | O
reached O
the O
house O
- O
door O
before O
the O
postboy B-ORG
had O
succeeded O
in O
his O
attempts O
to O
untie O
the O
cord O
which O
|
     | O
fastened O
their O
trunks O
behind O
the O
chaise O
. O
Apparently O
hands O
were O
scarce O
at O
this O
unpromising O
|
     | O
hostelry O
, O
for O
he O
was O
performing O
the O
business O
alone O
, O
at O
which O
Mary B-PERSON
greatly O
rejoiced O
, O
as O
it O

     | O
enabled O
her O
to O
address O
him O
unobserved O
. O
" O

not O

the O
reply O

" O

could O
you O
not O
drive O
as O
a O
mile O

two B-CARDINAL
out O
of O
it O

said O
Mary B-PERSON

in O
a O
very O
coaxing O
voice O
. O

     | O
" O
We O
should O
like O

sleep O
at O

the O
postboy B-PRODUCT

By O
this O
time O
Mary B-PERSON
's O

     | O
purse O
was O
visible O
in O
her O
hand O
. O
The O
youth O
's O
countenance O
softened O
as O
he O
gazed O
upon O
it O
, O
and O
he O
|
     | O
presently O
gave O
an O
unequivocal O
symptom O
of O
relenting O
, O
by O
scratching O
his O
head O
. O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON

     | O
held O
half O

a O

sovereign O
between O
her O
finger O
and O
thumb O
— O
" O
I O
will O
give O
you O
this O

she O
said O
, O
beyond O

     | O
the O
sum O

are O
to O
receive O
for O
the O
horses O
if O
you O
will O
drive O
us O
on O
to O
some O
clean O
country O

we O
could O
sleep O

" O

  | O
" O
Where O
is O
the O
old O
lady O
? O
" O
demanded O
the O
boy O
in O
something O
like O
a O
whisper O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
will O
bring O
her O
out O
this O
moment O

" O
said O
she O
  O
and O
, O
without O
waiting O
further O
parley O
, O
Mary B-PERSON

     | O
flitted O
back O
again O
through O
the O
vapour O
of O
tobacco O
and O
spirits O
to O
rescue O
her O
old O
friend O
, O
— O
a O
deed O
|
     | O
of O
daring O
that O
found O
its O
reward O
in O
the O
look O

gentle O
satisfaction O
with O
which O
her O

one O
who O
could O
not O
bandy O
words O

she O
had O

     | O
therefore O
endured O
, O
without O
intermission O
or O
resistance O
, O
as O
much O
insolence O
as O
could O
be O
compressed O

into O
the O

     | O
following O

Mr. O

performed O
his O
part O
of O
the O
business O
ably O
, O
for O
the O
portly O
miller O
was O
waiting O
for O
|
     | O
the O
ladies O
in O
the O
parlour O
when O
they O
returned O
from O
their O
early O
walk O
. O
| 
  | O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
possessed O
a O
sort O
of O
instinctive O
skill O
in O
reading O
the O
human O
countenance O
, O
which O
|
     | O
rarely O
deceived O
her O
, O
and O
it O
took O
her O
not O
long O
to O
discover O
that O
the O
man O
she O
had O
now O
to O
deal O
with O
|
     | O
was O
one O
upon O
whom O
it O
would O
be O
folly O
to O
waste O
any O
arguments O
which O
did O
not O
affect O
his O
own O
|
     | O
interest O
. O
She O
, O
therefore O
, O
briefly O
stated O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
was O
of O
great O
importance O
to O
her O
to O
|
     | O
obtain O
sight O
of O
all O
the O
apprentices O
at O
Deep B-FAC
Valley I-FAC
Mill I-FAC
, O
having O
great O
reason O
to O
hope O
that O
she O
|
     | O
should O
find O
a O
young O
relative O
there O
, O
for O
whose O
release O
from O
all O
engagements O
she O
was O
willing O
to O
|
     | O
pay O
handsomely O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
It O
is O
not O
the O
custom O
, O
ma'am O
, O
to O
admit O
visiters O
at O
that O

found O

the O

solemnly O
. O

" O

" O

" O
That O
is O
hardly O
enough O

for O
the O

of O
offending O
so O
good O

the O

Mr. O
Timothy B-PERSON
Smith I-PERSON
looked O
at O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
's O
pocket O
- O
book O
and O
he O
looked O
at O
her O
. O
His O
glance O
at O
|
     | O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
inspired O
a O
strong O
inclination O
to O
increase O
his O
demands O
  O
but O
the O
miller B-ORG
had O
studied O
the O
|
     | O
human O
countenance O
as O
well O
as O
the O
lady O
, O
and O
when O
he O
looked O
at O
her O
he O
felt O
certain O
that O

     | O
young O
, O
rich O
, O
and O
very O
eager O
in O
pursuit O
of O
her O
object O
, O
she O
was O
not O
a O
fool O
, O
and O
that O
if O
he O
pushed O

     | O
her O
to O
a O
more O
preposterous O
payment O
than O
he O
had O
already O
proposed O

she O
would O
be O
likely O
enough O
to O

     | O
turn O
about O

look O
for O
another O
agent O

He O
therefore O
demurely O
replied O

" O
It O

all O

And O
without O
wasting O
any O
further O
time O
, O
the O
man O
of O
the O

received O
the O

, O
considering O
all O

enable O

her O

composure O

All O
that O
she O
heard O
of O
this O

     | O
mysterious O
mill O
tended O
to O
prove O
that O
it O
was O
precisely O
such O
a O
place O
as O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON

     | O
be O
likely O

fix O

The O
more O
she O
meditated O
the O
more O
she O
became O

convinced O

the O

there O

She O
had O
kept O
a O
copy O
of O
her O
letter O

the O

that O
she O
might O
show O
it O

Mr. O

from O

she O
hoped O

with O
Mrs. O

upon O
its O
probable O

possible O

     | O
effects O

occupied O
some O
portion O
of O
the O
tedious O
time O
  O
slowly O
dragging O
her O
steps O
up O
and O
down O
Mrs. O

     | O
Prescot B-ORG

little O

fidgety O
five B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
in O
a O
bower O
of O

     | O
scarlet O

employed O
the O
rest O

But O
the B-TIME
morning I-TIME
seemed O
endless O

and O
more O
than O
once O
she O

     | O
suspected O

her O

stood O
still O

The O
important O
letter O

before O

when O
it O

something O

that O
the O

no O

still O

Several B-TIME
minutes I-TIME

     | O
selected O

forth O

wave O

enough O

     | O
any O
further O
questioning O
. O
And O
thus O
the O
coming O
and O
going O
lasted O
for O
another B-TIME
half I-TIME
- I-TIME
hour I-TIME
without O
a O
|
     | O
word O
being O
spoken O
. O
|  
  | O
At O
length O
the O
sad O
monotony O
of O
the O
spectacle O
was O
broken O
, O
at O
least O
to O
the O
eyes O
of O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
by O
the O
|
     | O
appearance O
of O
a O
little O
girl O
, O
who O
though O
pale O
and O
lamentably O
thin O
, O
had O
not O
yet O
lost O
thereby O
the O
|
     | O
sweet O
expression O
of O
her O
delicate O
features O
, O
neither O
had O
the O
soul O
within O
yielded O
to O
the O
|
     | O
paralyzing O
influence O
of O
the O
hopeless O
, O
helpless O
, O
unvarying O
misery O
by O
which O
she O
was O
surrounded O
. O
|
     | O
Her O
soft O
gray O
eyes O
still O
retained O
their O
eloquent O
power O
of O
speaking O
, O
and O
the O
look O
of O
surprise O
, O
|
     | O
mixed O
with O
something O
that O
was O
almost O
approaching O
to O
pleasure O
, O
with O
which O
she O
fixed O
them O
upon O
|
     | O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
face O
caused O
her O
to O
make O
a O
sudden O
movement O
to O
detain O
her O
, O
as O
the O
child O
, O
following O
the O
|
     | O
example O
of O
the O
rest O
, O
was O
turning O
away O
. O
At O
first B-ORDINAL
this O
movement O
was O
caused O
entirely O
by O
the O
|
     | O
interest O
which O
the O
little O
creature O
herself O
inspired O
— O
but O
it O
almost O
immediately O
occurred O
to O
|
     | O
her O
, O
that O
here O
, O
at O
length O
, O
there O
was O
a O
chance O
of O
receiving O
a O
rational O
and O
intelligent O
answer O
to O
|
     | O
any O
question O
she O
might O
ask O
  O
and O
such O
strength O
did O
this O
idea O
gain O
as O
she O
continued O
to O
look O
at O
|
     | O
the O
child O
, O
that O
she O
told O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
to O
stop O
the O
approach O
of O
those O
who O
were O
coming O
on O
, O
and O
by O
|
     | O
keeping O
them O
waiting O
in O
the O
court O
for O
a B-TIME
minute I-TIME
or O
two B-CARDINAL
, O
to O
give O
her O
time O
to O
see O
if O
she O
could O
not O
|
     | O
learn O
something O
from O
this O
most O
interesting O
- O
looking O
little O
creature O
. O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
showed O
that O
|
     | O
she O
too O
thought O
something O
might O
now O
be O
hoped O
for O
, O
and O
with O
great O
alacrity O
stepped O
out O
into O
the O
|
     | O
court O
to O
meet O
the O
fresh O
arrivals O
, O
shutting O
, O
to O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
extreme O
satisfaction O
, O
the O
door O
of O
the O

     | O
room O
behind O
her O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
My O
dear O
little O
girl O
! O
" O
said O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
, O
taking O
the O
child O
's O
pale O
and O
slender O
hand O
in O
|
     | O
hers O
, O
" O
How O
came O
you O
in O
this O
sad O
place O
? O
You O

not O

it O

" O

  | O
" O
Not O
for O
very O
long O
, O
ma'am O
, O
" O
was O
the O
reply O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
But O
you O
have O
been O
here O
during O
the B-DATE

  | O
" O
I O
have O
been O
here O
for O
several B-DATE

answered O
the O
little O
girl O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Can O
you O
tell O
me O
" O
— O
and O
Mary B-PERSON
almost O
gasped O
as O
she O
asked O
the O
question O
— O
" O
Can O
you O
tell O
me O
, O
if O
|
     | O
there O
be O
a O
boy O
here O
called O
Michael B-PERSON
Armstrong I-PERSON
? O
" O
| 
  | O
The O
look O
of O
modest O
and O
well O
- O
pleased O
curiosity O
with O
which O
the O
soft O
eyes O
were O
fixed O
on O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
|
     | O
face O
, O
was O
instantly O
changed O
for O
an O
expression O
of O
deep O
anguish O
— O
for O
a O
few O
moments O
no O
reply O
was O
|
     | O
uttered O
, O
and O
large O
tears O
were O
already O
chasing O
each O
other O
down O
her O
cheeks O
before O
the O
trembling O
|
     | O
child O
found O
voice O
to O
speak O

at O
last O
she O
uttered O
, O
almost O
in O
a O
whisper O
, O

still O
looking O
through O

     | O
her O
tears O
in O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
face O
— O
" O
Michael B-PERSON

" O

to O
reach O
the O
ears O
of O
Mrs. O

, O
who O
immediately O

, O
close O
to O

     | O
which O
she O

entered O
in O
dismay O

Several O
of O

were O
by O

time O
assembled O
in O
the O

followed O
at O
her O
heels O
, O

     | O
thrusting O
open O
the O
door O

staring O
at O
the O
scene O

said O
poor O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
weeping O
from O
sorrow O
, O
disappointment O
, O
and O
complete O

     | O
prostration O
of O
spirits O
. O
Before O
she O
spoke O
another O
word O
, O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
obeyed O
her O
instructions O
, O

gently O
pushing O
back O
the O
curious O

closed O

weeping O
afresh O
, O
as O

, O
in O
saying O
this O

the O
child O
ceased O

, O
young O

as O
she O
was O
, O
an O
expression O
of O
such O
hopeless O

enduring O
composure O

possession O

Mary B-PERSON

I O

he O

it O
's O
very O
right O

fair O
that O
so O
it O
should O
be O

If O
a O
horse O
can O

he O
ought O

the O
person O
of O
the O
child O

she O
nestled O
closely O
to O
her O

that O
she O
felt O
persuaded O

the O
proposal O
of O
Mr. O

frightened O
her O
. O

" O
You O
are O
very O
kind O

she O
replied O
, O
drawing O
the O
child O
, O
sordid O

its O
wretched O
garments O
were O

her O
away O

exactly O

I O

     | O
first B-ORDINAL
looked O
upon O

" O
Dear O
me O

only O
to O

the O
beauty O

Mary B-PERSON
again O
thanked O
him O
for O
his O
civility O

felt O
disposed O

that O
he O
might O
have O

     | O
executed O
his O
mission O
more O
satisfactorily O

returned O

about B-TIME

with O
the O

     | O
assurance O

an O
hour O

An B-TIME
hour I-TIME
at O
that O
moment O
seemed O
to O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
an O
almost O
interminable O
space O
of O
time O

     | O
felt O
painfully O
conscious O

" O
confined O

pent O
up O
" O
with O
sin O

suffering O

Heated O
, O

     | O
agitated O
, O
and O
impatient O
— O
panting O
for O
the O
fresh O
air O
, O
and O
longing O
to O
question O
her O
little O
|
     | O
purchased O
protégée O
, O
concerning O
poor O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
she O
determined O
to O
walk O
forward O
on O
the O
road O
they O
|
     | O
had O
that B-TIME
morning I-TIME
traversed O
, O
and O
letting O
Mr. O
Smith B-PERSON
and O
his O
cart O
overtake O
them O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Should O
you O
dislike O
walking O
on O
, O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
? O
" O
she O
said O
. O
" O
My O
head O
aches O
, O
and O
I O
am O
sure O

     | O
nothing O
will O
relieve O
me O
but O
a O
walk O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
should O
like O
it O
too O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
" O
replied O
her O
observant O
companion O
, O
looking O
anxiously O
in O
her O

     | O
face O
, O

perfectly O
understanding O
her O
feelings O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Walk O
, O
ladies O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
Mr. O
Woodcomb B-PERSON
, O
looking O
exceedingly O
shocked O
, O
" O
ladies O
such O
as O
you O
to O
|
     | O
walk O
out O
upon O
our O
wild O
moors O
? O
Oh O
dear O
no O
! O
That O
is O
quite O
impossible O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
This O
was O
said O
to O
prove O
at O
once O
his O
tender O
care O
of O
personages O
possessing O
the O
power O
of O
|
     | O
dispensing O
hundreds B-CARDINAL
, O
and O
to O
show O
that O
he O
was O
not O
unacquainted O
with O
the O
refinements O
of O
polite O
|
     | O
society O
  O
but O
this O
civilly O
- O
intended O
opposition O
to O
their O
exit O
produced O
on O
his O
hearers O
an O
effect O
|
     | O
very O
different O
from O
what O
he O
intended O
. O
| 
  | O
That B-PERSON
Fanny I-PERSON
Fletcher I-PERSON
should O
tremble O
at O
the O
mention O
of O
delay O
was O
not O
extraordinary O
, O
but O
that O
|
     | O
Mary B-PERSON
should O
hear O
again O
, O
in O
fancy O
, O
the O
grating O
sound O
of O
the O
locks O
and O
bars O
, O
which O
had O
closed O
|
     | O
behind O
her O
as O
she O
entered O
, O
and O
feel O
a O
sick O
qualm O
at O
her O
heart O
, O
as O
if O
she O
were O
betrayed O
, O
and O
|
     | O
doomed O
to O
remain O
in O
that O
hateful O
spot O
against O
her O
will O
, O
showed O
that O
her O
nerves O
had O
indeed O
been O
|
     | O
severely O
shaken O
, O
and O
that O
her O
heroism O
had O
more O
of O
zeal O
than O
strength O
in O
it O
. O
| 
   | O
at O
present O
. O
She O
is O
a O
great O
walker O
, O
and O
a O
mile O
or O
so O
, O
creeping O
along O
in O
the O
fresh O
|
     | O
air O
, O
will O
do O
her O
a O
deal O
of O
good O
. O
" O
|  
  | O
" O
In O
course O
you O
know O
best O
, O
ladies O
, O

I O
ca O
n't O
, O
for O
certain O
, O
take O
the O
liberty O
to O
oppose O

But O
, O
|
     | O
by O
your O
leave O
, O
I O
'll O
just O
mention O
your O
plan O
to O
Mr. O
Smith B-PERSON
before O
you O
start O
, O
and O
then O
, O
maybe O
he O
'll O
|
     | O
be O
for O
pushing O
on O
his O
horse O
a O
little O
. O
" O

  | O
So O
saying O
, O
Mr. O
Woodcomb B-PERSON
left O
them O
  O
when O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
turning O
to O
the O
little O
girl O
, O
said O
, O
" O
Have O
you O
any O
|
     | O
bonnet O
and O
shawl O
to O
put O
on O
, O
Fanny B-PERSON
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
child O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Not O
know O
? O
How O
can O
that O
be O
, O
Fanny B-PERSON
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Because O
I O
have O
never O
been O
out O
of O
the O
doors O
since O
I O
first B-ORDINAL
came O
into O
them O
, O
" O
said O
Fanny B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Poor O
dear O
! O
I O
wish O
they O
would O
not O
keep O
you O
here O
any O
longer O
— O
this O
is O
quite O
intolerable O
! O
" O
said O
|
     | O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
again O
opening O
the O
door O
, O
and O
looking O
impatiently O
across O
the O
dismal O
court O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Keep O
me O
here O
? O
" O
murmured O
the O
little O
girl O
, O
in O
a O
voice O
of O
the O
most O
evident O
terror O
. O
" O
Do O
you O
|
     | O
think O
they O
will O
keep O
me O
here O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
No O
, O
no O
, O
my O
poor O
child O
, O
they O
shall O
not O
keep O
you O
here O
, O
" O
said O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
, O
kindly O
. O
" O
Here O
come O
|
     | O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
men O
together O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Fanny B-PERSON
did O
not O
venture O
to O
look O
at O
them O
, O
but O
Mary B-PERSON
did O
  O
and O
again O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
her O
reason O
, O
she O
|
     | O
felt O
terrified O
at O
the O
idea O
that O
she O
was O
in O
their O
power O
. O
Mr. O
Woodcomb B-PERSON
, O
indeed O
, O
looked O
smiling O
|
     | O
and O
obsequious O
as O
before O
, O
but O
in O
the O
countenance O
of O
the O
burly O
miller O
there O
was O
something O
of O
|
     | O
opposition O
and O
displeasure O
that O
she O
could O
not O
understand O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Setting O
off O
walking O
, O
miss O
, O
is O
very O
like O
bilking O
your O
driver O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
with O
considerably O
|
     | O
more O
bluntness O
than O
civility O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
What O
does O
he O
mean O
, O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
? O
" O
said O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
turning O
pale O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
You O
had O
better O
pay O
the O
gentleman O
before O
you O
set O
out O

ma'am O
, O
it O
would O
be O
more O
like O
doing O
business O

replied O
the O
man O
, O
looking O
a O
little O

     | O
ashamed O
of O
himself O
. O

  | O
" O
Is O
that O
all O
? O
" O
said O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
inexpressibly O
relieved O
, O
and O
drawing O
out O
her O
ready O
purse O
with O
such O
|
     | O
cheerful O
alacrity O
, O
that O
could O
the O
hearts O
of O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
men O
before O
whom O
she O
stood O
have O
been O

there O
might O
have O
been O
found O
in O
both O
a O
strong O
inclination O
to O
profit O
by O
it O
a O
little O
further O
. O

" O
That O

I O
think O

the O
sum O

said O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
extending O

     | O
her O
hand O
with O
two B-CARDINAL
sovereigns O
towards O
him O
. O
| 
  | O
Mr. O
Timothy B-PERSON
Smith I-PERSON
took O
the O
money O
, O
but O
certainly O
thought O
that O
if O
that O
sharp O
- O
eyed O
rogue O

     | O
Woodcomb B-PERSON
had O
been O
further O
he O
might O
have O
hit O
upon O
some O
excuse O
for O
demanding O
more O
. O
As O
it O
was O
, O

     | O
however O
, O
he O
could O
not O
venture O
it O
, O
and O
with O
a O
rather O
surly O
inclination O
of O
the O
head O
, O
pocketed O
the O

     | O
gold O

left O

" O

  | O
Mary B-PERSON
looked O
in O
his O
face O
, O
and O
the O
sort O
of O
half B-CARDINAL
- O
ashamed O
glance O
with O
which O
the O
extortioner O
|
     | O
watched O
the O
effect O
of O
his O
words O
, O
appeared O
to O
her O
so O
sinister O
, O
that O
with O
a O
sudden O
feeling O
of O

     | O
something O
like O
rational O
alarm O

she O
remembered O

you O

she O
said O
, O
at O
the O

time O
drawing O
out O
again O

     | O
her O
almost O
empty O
purse O

     | O
Woodcomb B-PERSON
, O
keeping O
his O
eyes O
, O
however O
, O
furtively O
directed O
towards O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
still O

     | O
engaged O
in O
seeking O
for O
money O
in O
the O
recesses O

a O
very O
large O
pocket O

said O
the O
old O
lady O
, O
at O
length O
placing O
her O

     | O
little O
leathern O
purse O

" O
That O

said O
the O
worshipper O
of O
Mammon B-ORG
, O
with O
an O
air O
and O
tone O

     | O
of O
the O
most O
amiable O
liberality O
, O
but O
at O
the O
same O
time O
stretching O
out O
his O
hand O
, O
in O
which O
he O
|
     | O
received O
the O
entire O
contents O
, O
uncounted O
, O
of O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
's O
purse O
, O
which O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON

     | O
unclasped O
, O

emptied O
into O
it O

Had O
she O
studied O
the O
man O
's O
character O
for O
years B-DATE
, O
she O
could O
not O
have O
devised O
any O
manoeuvre O
so O

     | O
likely O
to O
hasten O
the O
unlocking O
the O
door O

enclosed O
them O
as O
thus O
emptying O
their O
two B-CARDINAL
purses O

     | O
before O
his O
eyes O
. O
He O
now O
moved O
forward O
of O
his O
own O
accord O
, O
drew O
forth O
from O
the O
pocket O
of O
his O
coat O
|
     | O
the O
massive O
key O
, O
applied O
it O
with O
a O
large O

strong O
, O

effective O
hand O

to O
the O
enormous O
lock O

     | O
drew O
back O

heavy O
bolts O

finally O
threw O
wide O
the O
hateful O
door O

The O
three B-CARDINAL
females O
passed O
through O
it O
with O
no O
lingering O
steps O
, O
and O
heard O
it O
close O
heavily O

     | O
behind O
them O
, O
with O
feelings O
assuredly O
very O
different O
in O
degree O

in O
so O
far O
the O
same O

that O

     | O
each O
one O
as O
she O
stepped O
over O
the O
threshold O

breathed O
a O
prayer O

a O
sense O

, O
sufficient O

expand O
the O

Mary B-PERSON
felt O
disposed O
to O
bound O
along O
the O
grassy O
path O
beside O
the O
|
     | O
stream O
with O
the O
joyous O
playfulness O
of O
a O
child O
, O
and O
rather O
than O
have O
re O
- O
entered O
that O
creaking O
|
     | O
door O
again O
, O
would O
have O
been O
tempted O
, O
like O
another O
Undine B-PERSON
, O
to O
plunge O
into O
the O
water O
, O
and O
take O
|
     | O
her O
chance O
of O
finding O
quarters O
less O
hateful O
beneath O
its O
rippling O
wave O
. O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
breathed O
|
     | O
more O
freely O
, O
and O
seemed O
to O
have O
recovered O
the O
elastic O
step O
of O
youth O
, O
as O
she O
moved O
briskly O
on O
. O
|
     | O
But O
compared O
with O
what O
was O
passing O
in O
the O
breast O
of O
the O
ragged O
, O
dirty O
little O
creature O
that O
|
     | O
walked O
beside O
them O
, O
their O
feelings O
were O
most O
earthly O
cold O
and O
dull O
. O
Her O
small O
hand O
was O
still O
|
     | O
clasped O
in O
that O
of O
Miss B-PERSON
Brotherton I-PERSON
, O
who O
felt O
that O
the O
child O
was O
urging O
her O
onward O
, O
even O
faster O
|
     | O
than O
she O
was O
inclined O
to O
go O
, O
while O
her O
head O
upturned O
towards O
the O
towering O
heights O
which O
hemmed O
|
     | O
them O
in O
, O
seemed O
eagerly O
seeking O
an O
outlet O
from O
the O
region O
that O
her O
soul O
abhorred O
. O
|  
  | O
" O
You O
are O
glad O
, O
dear O
Fanny B-PERSON
, O
are O
you O
not O
, O
to O
know O
that O
you O
have O
left O
that O
frightful O
place O
? O
" O
|
     | O
said O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
kindly O
pressing O
the O
little O
emaciated O
hand O
she O
held O
in O
hers O
. O
The O
child O
stopped O
short O
|
     | O
in O
her O
hurried O
walk O
, O
and O
looking O
up O
in O
her O
deliverer O
's O
face O
, O
with O
a O
doubting O
anxious O
look O
that O
|
     | O
it O
was O
painful O
to O
see O
, O
murmured O
very O
softly O
, O
and O
as O
if O
fearing O
to O
be O
overheard O
from O
within O
the O
|
     | O
walls O
, O
| 
  | O
" O
Shall O
I O
never O
, O
never O
go O
back O
again O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
No O
, O
never O
Fanny B-PERSON
! O
Do O
you O
think O
I O
would O
be O
so O
cruel O
as O
to O
take O
you O
back O
? O
" O
said O
Mary B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
do O
not O
know O
if O
it O
is O
not O
all O
a O
dream O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
child O
. O
" O
I O
have O
dreamed O
that O
I O
saw O
green O
|
     | O
grass O
, O
and O
felt O
the O
air O
upon O
my O
face O
, O
before O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Do O
not O
be O
afraid O
, O
Fanny B-PERSON
! O
You O
are O
not O
dreaming O
now O
, O
" O
returned O
Mary B-PERSON
. O
" O
Run O
on O
, O
and O
gather O
that O
|
     | O
fine O
large O
stalk O
of O
foxglove O
. O
You O
never O
saw O
such O
a O
gay O
flower O
as O
that O
in O
your O
dreams O
, O
did O
|
     | O
you O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
The O
little O
girl O
sprang O
forward O
, O
and O
falling O
upon O
her O
knees O
on O
the O
grass O
, O
plucked O
the O
tall O
|
     | O
flower O
, O
and O
pressed O
it O
to O
her O
lips O
, O
and O
to O
her O
heart O
. O
But O
though O
this O
was O
a O
childish O
action O
, O
it O
|
     | O
was O
not O
done O
childishly O
: O
there O
was O
an O
appearance O
of O
deep O
feeling O
, O
and O
even O
of O
devotion O
in O
her O
|
     | O
look O
and O
attitude O
which O
strongly O
awakened O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
interest O
, O
and O
when O
the O
little O
creature O
rose O
|
     | O
again O
, O
and O
holding O
the O
flower O
in O
one B-CARDINAL
hand O
, O
slid O
the O
other O
once O
more O
into O
that O
of O
her O
new O
|
     | O
friend O
, O
the O
heart O
of O
that O
friend O
yearned O
towards O
her O
with O
newly O
- O
awakened O
tenderness O
. O
But O
when O
|
     | O
she O
spoke O
to O
her O
, O
and O
endeavoured O
to O
lead O
her O
into O
conversation O
, O
the O
attempt O
entirely O
failed O
. O
|
     | O
There O
are O
many O
who O
might O
have O
felt O
disappointed O
and O
chilled O
by O
this O
  O
but O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton I-PERSON
had O
|
     | O
truer O
sympathy O
, O
and O
as O
, O
from O
time O
to O
time O
, O
she O
felt O
a O
loving O
contraction O
of O
Fanny B-PERSON
's O
little O
|
     | O
fingers O
upon O
her O
own O
, O
and O
sometimes O
caught O
her O
looking O
up O
, O
as O
if O
by O
stealth O
into O
her O
face O
, O
she O
|
     | O
felt O
no O
misgivings O
as O
to O
the O
cause O
of O
her O
silence O
, O
but O
loved O
her O
the O
better O
from O
knowing O
that O
|
     | O
her O
heart O
was O
too O
full O
to O
speak O
. O
| 
   | O
forward O
as O
long O
as O
their O
road O
continued O
along O
the O
margin O
of O
the O
stream O
  O
but O
when O
|
     | O
it O
turned O
round O
the O
steep O
hill O
's O
base O
, O
and O
began O
to O
mount O
, O
their O
pace O
relaxed O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
felt O
that O
|
     | O
her O
little O
companion O
dragged O
on O
her O
steps O
with O
labour O
, O
and O
perceived O
that O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
was O
out O
|
     | O
of O
breath O
. O
|  
  | O
" O
Let O
us O
sit O
down O
under O
this O
ash O
- O
tree O
, O
and O
wait O
for O
the O
jolly O
miller O
, O
" O
said O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
, O
|
     | O
" O
it O
can O
not O
be O
very O
long O
, O
I O
think O
, O
before O
he O
overtakes O
us O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
This O
proposal O
was O
the O
more O
amiable O
, O
because O
, O
in O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
place O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
could O
herself O
have O
run O
|
     | O
from O
the O
bottom O
of O
that O
steep O
hill O
to O
the O
top O
, O
almost O
without O
perceiving O
that O
it O
was O
any O
hill O
|
     | O
at O
all O
  O
and O
in O
the O
next O
, O
she O
so O
exceedingly O
disliked O
both O
the O
miller O
and O
his O
cart O
, O
that O
had O
she O
|
     | O
consulted O
her O
own O
inclinations O
alone O
, O
she O
would O
probably O
have O
preferred O
retracing O
the O
whole O
way O
|
     | O
on O
foot O
. O
| 
  | O
But O
very O
gladly O
was O
her O
proposal O
for O
rest O
accepted O
, O
by O
both O
her O
old O
and O
young O
companion O
, O
and O
|
     | O
long O
did O
they O
remain O
seated O
under O
their O
pleasant O
canopy O
before O
they O
any O
of O
them O
grew O
weary O
of O
|
     | O
it O
  O
till O
at O
length O
, O
after O
consulting O
her O
watch O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
expressed O
a O
doubt O
whether O
the O
|
     | O
fat O
miller O
and O
his O
lazy O
steed O
intended O
to O
overtake O
them O

all O

think O
so O
? O
" O
said O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
, O
considerably O
alarmed O
. O
|
     | O
" O
Why O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
we O
shall O
never O
get O
back O
to O
Mrs. O
Prescot B-PERSON
's O
without O
him O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
hope O
I O
may O
be O
mistaken O
, O
my O
dear O
old O
woman O
, O
" O
said O
her O
kind O
mistress O
, O
affectionately O
  O
" O
for O
I O
|
     | O
fear O
such O
a O
walk O
would O
be O
too O
much O
for O
you O
. O
But O
when O
I O
remember O
that O
he O
is O
paid O
, O
and O
remember O
, O
|
     | O
likewise O
, O
how O
very O
little O
he O
seemed O
actuated O
by O
any O
motive O
, O
save O
that O
of O
sordid O
interest O
, O
I O
|
     | O
confess O
that O
I O
do O
think O
it O
very O
probable O
he O
means O
to O
leave O
us O
in O
the O
lurch O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Then O
let O
us O
walk O
on O
, O
Miss O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
without O
saying O
a O
word O
more O
about O
it O
. O
The O
shadows O
are O

     | O
beginning O
to O
grow O
long O
already O
, O
and O
you O
sha O
n't O
be O
kept O
out O
half B-TIME
the I-TIME
night I-TIME
by O
my O
laziness O
. O
Come O
|
     | O
along O
, O
little O
girl O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
With O
these O
words O
, O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
raised O
herself O
from O
between B-CARDINAL
two I-CARDINAL
comfortable O
roots O
, O
which O
had O
|
     | O
made O
her O
an O
excellent O
arm O
- O
chair O
  O
but O
the O
little O
girl O
whom O
she O
summoned O
to O
do O
likewise O
, O
though O
|
     | O
she O
exerted O
herself O
to O
get O
on O
her O
feet O
, O
seemed O
hardly O
able O
to O
stand O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
My O
poor O
Fanny B-PERSON
, O
you O
are O
quite O
knocked O
up O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
, O
looking O
at O
her O
with O
|
     | O
great O
anxiety O
. O
" O
How O
in O
the O
world O
shall O
we O
ever O
be O
able O
to O
get O
her O
on O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
It O
is O
only O
because O
I O
have O
not O
been O
used O
to O
walk O
lately O
, O
" O
said O
Fanny B-PERSON
  O
" O
that O
is O
, O
not O
as O
we O
|
     | O
have O
been O
walking O
now O
. O
Our O
work O
keeps O
us O
always O
on O
our O
legs O
, O
and O
that O
makes O
them O
bend O
about O
so O
, O
|
     | O
when O
I O
try O
to O
walk O
  O
but O
I O
|  | O
can O
|  | O
walk O
though O
it O
hurts O
me O
, O
and O
I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
better O
|
     | O
to O
die O
outright O
in O
getting O
on O
, O
rather O
than O
rest O
so O
near O
the O
factory O
— O
so O
, O
please O
ma'am O
, O
I O
'm O

     | O
quite O
ready O
to O
go O
on O

" O
| 
   | O
The O
dilemma O
was O
not O
a O
pleasant O
one O
. O
They O
were O
still O
in O
a O
part O
of O
the O
road O
so O
|
     | O
little O
frequented O
, O
that O
it O
was O
probable O
they O
might O
wait O
for O
hours B-TIME
without O
obtaining O
assistance O
|
     | O
from O
any O
passer O
by O
, O
nor O
did O
either O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
or O
Mary B-PERSON
recollect O
to O
have O
seen O
any O
dwelling O
|
     | O
nearer O
than O
the O
high O
- O
road O
, O
from O
which O
they O
were O
still O
at O
a O
considerable O
distance O
. O
|  
  | O
The O
distress O
of O
the O
little O
girl O
was O
painful O
to O
witness O
. O
At O
the O
very O
moment O
when O
the O
dark O
|
     | O
cloud O
which O
had O
seemed O
to O
settle O
upon O
her O
was O
withdrawn O
, O
and O
hope O
gradually O
and O
with O
|
     | O
difficulty O
, O
as O
to O
eyes O
long O
unaccustomed O
to O
its O
light O
, O
began O
to O
reach O
her O
  O
at O
that O
very O
moment O
|
     | O
her O
strength O
failed O
, O
and O
a O
sensation O
, O
like O
the O
sickness O
of O
death O
, O
rendered O
every O
attempt O
at O
|
     | O
further O
exertion O
impossible O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
must O
stay O
here O
, O
" O
she O
said O
  O
" O
it O

" O

  | O
" O
No O

said O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
, O
seating O
herself O
beside O
her O
, O
and O
letting O
the O
languid O

     | O
little O
head O
drop O
upon O
her O
bosom O
  O
" O
you O
have O
no O

It O
is O
a O
most O
strange O
chance O

has O
brought O
me O
here O
, O

placed O
you O
in O

my O
hands O

this O
was O
by O
the O
will O

I O
will O
not O

" O

off O

it O
over O

" O

then O
I O
believe O

that O
there O

more O
chance O

your O

without O

with O
a O

out O

     | O
Having O
reached O
the O
top O

anxiously O
round O

search O
of O
a O
human O
dwelling O

nothing O
met O
her O
eye O

barren O
moor O
- O
land O
, O
which O
at O
some O
distance O
showed O
symptoms O

there O
the O
fragment O

along O

level O

without O

a O
dazzling O
sunset O

in O
her O
eyes O

her O
way O
up O

looked O
like O
one O
of O
the O
tumuli O

served O
as O
resting O
- O
places O
for O
human O

     | O
bones O
, O
ere O
churchyards O
yawned O
for O
them O

Greatly O
was O
she O
startled O
on O
reaching O
the O
top O
of O
it O
, O
to O
|
     | O
perceive O
on O
the O
western O
side O
, O
crouching O
in O
a O
hollow O
that O
looked O
as O
if O
it O
had O
been O
excavated O
by O
|
     | O
the O
shelter O
- O
seeking O
sheep O
, O
a O
strange O
wild O
figure O
, O
whose O
dress O
, O
as O
she O
looked O
down O
upon O
it O
, O
left O
|
     | O
its O
sex O
doubtful O
. O
The O
fragment O
of O
a O
hat O
, O
and O
the O
remnant O
of O
a O
jacket O
were O
evidently O
intended O
, O
|
     | O
by O
their O
original O
construction O
, O
for O
the O
use O
of O
the O
nobler O
sex O
, O
while O
something O
resembling O
a O
|
     | O
petticoat O
enveloping O
the O
lower O
half B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
figure O
, O
suggested O
the O
probability O
that O
the O
masculine O
|
     | O
portion O
of O
the O
attire O
was O
worn O
by O
sufferance O
, O
and O
not O
by O
right O

Mary B-PERSON
's O
light O
step O
among O
the O
matted O
tufts O
of O
coarse O
vegetation O
which O
covered O
the O
thin O
soil O
, O
|
     | O
had O
not O
been O
heard O
, O
and O
she O
stood O
looking O
down O
upon O
her O
doubtful O
neighbour O
with O
the O
advantage O
|
     | O
of O
being O
herself O
unseen O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
There O
goes O
another O
day O
! O
" O
said O
a O
voice O
, O
which O
though O
harsh O
and O
aged O
, O
was O
unmistakably O
female O
  O
|
     | O
" O
and O
the O
silly O
soul O
has O
got O
to O
wait O
for O
another O

" O
| 
  | O
Glad O
to O
find O
that O
her O
unexpected O
companion O
in O
this O
most O
desolate O
spot O
, O
was O
of O
the O
safer O
, O

     | O
because O
the O
weaker O
portion O
of O
the O
human O
race O
, O
the O
wandering O
heiress O
determined O
to O
address O
her O
  O

     | O
but O
deemed O
it O
wisest O
to O
approach O
her O
visibly O
, O
instead O
of O
startling O
the O
poor O
soul O
by O
speaking O
to O
|
     | O
her O
unexpectedly O
from O
the O
spot O
where O
she O
stood O
. O
For O
this O
purpose O
, O
she O
gently O
descended O
from O
her O
|
     | O
elevation O
, O
and O
making O
a O
little O
circuit O
, O
presented O
herself O
before O
the O
eyes O
of O
the O
sun O
- O
gazer O
. O

  | O
The O
old O
woman O
, O
for O
such O
she O
was O
, O
sat O
nose O
and O
knees O
together O
, O
in O
a O
sort O
of O
hole O
which O
|
     | O
completely O
sheltered O
her O
in O
every O
direction O
but O
the O
west O
  O
and O
from O
the O
earnest O
manner O
in O
which O
|
     | O
her O
dim O
eyes O
were O
fixed O
upon O
the O
last O
bright O
rays O
of O
the O
setting O
sun O
, O
it O
seemed O
as O
if O
her O
lair O

     | O
was O
chosen O
on O
purpose O

look O

The O
appearance O
of O

to O
startle O
her O

not O
much O
  O
for O
after O
looking O
at O
her O
for O
a B-TIME

     | I-TIME
minute I-TIME
as O
if O
she O
examined O
her O
person O
with O
difficulty O

her O
eyes O
were O
dazzled O
by O
the O

     | O
object O
on O
which O
she O
had O
before O

gazing O

pointing O
a O
stick O
that O
she O
held O
towards O

     | O
the O
point O

the O
bright O
orb O

just O

Mary B-PERSON
shuddered O
as O
the O
wild O
speech O
of O
this O
poor O
creature O
confirmed O
the O
idea O

insanity O

trembling O
voice O

in O
an O

up O

innocence O

she O
exclaimed O

smoothing O

patting O
it O
with O
her O
hand O
, O
as O
if O
it O

had O
been O
a O
tame O

bird O

" O
I O
think O

she O
added O

with O
a O
sagacious O
nod O

will O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
poor O
creature O
, O
in O
a O
tone O
which O
convinced O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
that O
she O
|
     | O
understood O
her O
, O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
beginning O
to O
hobble O
on O
before O
her O
towards O
the O
road O
. O
| 
   | O
desperate O
one O
, O
determined O
to O
follow O
wherever O
her O
feeble O
guide O
should O
lead O
, O
|
     | O
certain O
, O
at O
least O
, O
that O
the O
distance O
could O
not O
be O
very O
great O
. O
|  
  | O
There O
was O
, O
however O
, O
much O
more O
strength O
and O
power O
of O
locomotion O
in O
the O
little O
cripple O
than O
she O
|
     | O
gave O
her O
credit O
for O
. O
Having O
contrived O
to O
crawl O
through O
the O
grassy O
dyke O
that O
fenced O
the O
moor O
, O
|
     | O
she O
crossed O
the O
road O
obliquely O
, O
and O
making O
her O
way O
through O
a O
very O
imperfect O
hedge O
of O
furze B-ORG
and O
|
     | O
quickset O
, O
hobbled O
on O
across O
a O
bit O
of O
miserably O
arid O
stubble O
, O
which O
presently O
descended O
|
     | O
abruptly O
, O
and O
led O
to O
a O
tuft O
of O
stunted O
elder O
- O
bushes O
, O
besides O
which O
stood O
a O
small O
farm O
- O
house O
, O
|
     | O
with O
its O
cow O
- O
yard O
, O
barns O
, O
and O
ricks O
. O
| 
  | O
Surprised O
and O
delighted O
to O
find O
herself O
so O
near O
a O
human O
dwelling O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
had O
hardly O
patience O
to O
|
     | O
restrain O
her O
steps O
to O
the O
pace O
of O
her O
poor O
guide O
, O
nevertheless O
she O
had O
not O
the O
heart O
to O
leave O
|
     | O
her O
, O
for O
there O
was O
an O
expression O
of O
pride O
and O
pleasure O
in O
the O
woman O
's O
eye O
as O
she O
turned O
round O
|
     | O
from O
time O
to O
time O
as O
they O
advanced O
, O
which O
she O
felt O
it O
would O
be O
most O
cruel O
to O
check O
by O
showing O
|
     | O
that O
she O
could O
do O
without O
her O
. O
So O
it O
was O
together O
that O
they O
reached O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
steep O
|
     | O
descent O
, O
and O
together O
that O
they O
entered O
the O
kitchen O
of O
the O
farm O
- O
house O
, O
where O
a O
very O
|
     | O
decent O
- O
looking O
, O
middle O
- O
aged O
woman O
was O
engaged O
in O
preparing O
supper O
. O
She O
looked O
exceedingly O
|
     | O
surprised O
at O
the O
appearance O
of O
Miss B-PERSON
Brotherton I-PERSON
, O
and O
for O
a O
moment O
turned O
her O
eyes O
from O
her O
to O
|
     | O
her O
companion O
, O
and O
back O
again O
, O
with O
an O
air O
that O
was O
almost O
bewildered O
  O
but O
soon O
recovering O
|
     | O
herself O
she O
courtesied O
with O
much O
respect O
, O
and O
said O
, O
" O
I O
hope O
you O
have O
n't O
been O
scared O

ma'am O
, O
by O

     | O
falling O
in O
with O

" O

  | O
" O
Oh O

" O
replied O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
" O
she O

been O
very O
kind O

the O

so O
completely O
concealed O

I O

" O
You O

met O
no O

" O
said O
the O
good O
woman O
, O
kindly O
, O
and O
ceasing O
her O
notable O
|
     | O
operations O
, O
she O
drew O
forward O
a O
wooden O
chair O
for O
her O
guest O
to O
sit O
upon O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Thank O
you O
very O
much O

" O
said O
the O
young O
lady O
, O
seating O
herself O
. O
" O
Yet O
it O

I O
have O
a O

I O

from O

too O
weak O

ill O

was O
the O
answer O

" O

     | O
butter O

That O
is O
not O
the O
difficulty O

we O
sha O
n't O
like O
to O
have O
nothing O

to O
do O
with O
carrying O

  | O
" O
You O
need O
fear O
nothing O
on O
that O
point O
, O
" O
replied O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
, O
eagerly O
, O
" O
I O
have O
paid O
for O

     | O
permission O

bring O
this O
child O

" O
| 
   | O
— O
there O
is O
something O
very O
odd O
too O
, O
in O
such O
a O
lady O
as O
you O
walking O
away O
from O
the O

     | O
factory O
with O

" O
Indeed O
I O
do O
not O
wonder O
at O
your O
saying O

believe O
me O
, O
I O
tell O
you O
nothing O

the O
truth O

I O
assure O
you O

Our O
unfortunately O
attempting O
to O
walk O
was O
merely O
accident O
, O

occasioned O
entirely O
by O
my O

     | O
foolish O
impatience O
to O
get O
away O

before O

go O
back O

the O

for O
the O
good O
man O

she O
prepared O

     | O
taking O
off O

Miss O

     | O
anxious O
to O

by O
a O
very O
short O
cut O
across O
the O
piece O
of O
meadow O

The O
joy O
of O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
at O
seeing O
her O
was O
great O
indeed O
  O
and O
poor O
Fanny B-PERSON
, O
refreshed O
by O
the O

     | O
interval O
of O
rest O
, O
declared O
herself O
quite O
able O
to O

piece O

" O

" O
Poor O

exclaimed O
good O
Mrs. O
Roberts B-PERSON
, O
the O
farmer O

wife O
  O
" O
she O
do O
look O
bad O

     | O
sure O
enough O

seldom O

never O

'em O

     | O
she O
puts O
me O
strongly O
in O

of O

Sally B-PERSON

stories O
to O
be O
sure O

" O

  | O
The O
little O
party O
reached O
the O
farm O
without O
difficulty O
, O
and O
then O
, O
indeed O
, O
as O
Mary B-PERSON
had O
|
     | O
predicted O
, O
all O
their O
present O
troubles O
seemed O
over O
, O
for O
nothing O
could O
exceed O
the O
earnest O

     | O
kindness O
with O
which O
Mrs. O
Roberts B-PERSON
administered O
to O
all O
their O
wants O
. O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
's O
appearance O
|
     | O
and O
manner O
appeared O
to O
have O
entirely O
removed O
the O
sort O
of O
doubtful O
impression O
which O
poor O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
|
     | O
hurried O
|  | O
entrée O

had O
produced O
, O

having O
been O
told O
that O
the O
little O
girl O
had O
been O
|
     | O
reclaimed O
by O
them O
as O
a O
relation O
, O
the O
whole O
adventure O
appeared O
to O
her O
as O
one O
of O
the O
deepest O

     | O
interest O
, O
and O
her O
sympathy O
and O
good O
- O
will O
were O
most O
fully O
excited O
. O
| 
  | O
Old O
Sally B-PERSON
was O
sitting O
upon O
the O
floor O
exactly O
where O
they O
had O
left O
her O
. O
" O
Poor O
thing O
! O
" O
exclaimed O

     | O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
" O
she O

" O

" O
Not O
she O

poor O
soul O

" O
replied O
Mrs. O
Roberts B-PERSON
, O
" O
I O
told O
her O
to O
bide O
still O

her O

she O
'd O
keep O

Get O
up O
, O
Sally B-PERSON

" O
she O

     | O
added O
, O
good O
- O
humouredly O
. O
" O
There O

brave O
woman O
! O
Look O
at O

The O
expression O
of O
the O
poor O
withered O
, O
idiot O
face O
, O
that O
was O
turned O
upon O
Fanny B-PERSON
Fletcher I-PERSON
when O
|
     | O
this O
was O
uttered O
, O
was O
most O
touchingly O
sad O
and O
solemn O
. O
The O
gentle O
, O
silly O
look O
, O
which O
her O
|
     | O
countenance O
usually O
wore O
, O
was O
exchanged O
for O
one B-CARDINAL
full O
of O
deep O
mysterious O
meaning O
. O
She O
drew O
|
     | O
herself O
towards O
the O
little O
girl O
with O
a O
sort O
of O
stealthy O
movement O
, O
as O
if O
afraid O
of O
being O
seen O
to O

     | O
approach O
her O
, O
and O
when O
quite O
close O
beside O
her O
, O
said O
, O

   | O
little O
thing O

" O

  | O
" O
I O
have O
not O
run O
away O
, O
" O
said O
Fanny B-PERSON
, O
gently O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
maniac O
shook O
her O
head O
. O
" O
Do O
n't O
you O
scream O
as O
I O
did O
, O
my O
poor O
lamb O

for O
it O

no O
good O
  O
they O

     | O
care O
no O
more O
for O
screams O

groans O
than O
for O
the O
whirring O
of O
the O
spindles O
. O
But O
the O
screams O
went O
|
     | O
into O
my O
own O
ears O
, O

I O
have O
never O
got O

Sally B-PERSON

let O
her O
alone O
now O

going O
to O
eat O
something O

" O

  | O
And O
Mrs. O
Roberts B-PERSON
completed O
the O
arrangements O
upon O
which O
she O
had O
been O
occupied O
since O
they O
|
     | O
entered O
, O
by O
placing O
chairs O
at O
the O
table O
on O
which O
bread O
, O
butter O
, O
and O
cheese O
, O
were O
placed O
. O
| 
  | O
Not O
even O
did O
the O
Deep O
- O
Valley O
apprentice O
feel O
more O
disposed O
to O
do O
justice O
to O
these O
|
     | O
preparations O
than O
did O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
and O
her O
old O
servant O
. O
They O
had O
tasted O
nothing O
since O

     | O
breakfast O
, O
and O
when O
a O
bowl O
of O
fresh O
milk O
was O
added O
to O
the O
bread O
- O
and O
- O
butter O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
gratefully O
|
     | O
assured O
her O
entertainer O
that O
she O
considered O
it O
as O
the O
most O
delicious O
supper O
she O
had O
ever O

     | O
eaten O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Now O
that O
's O
different O
, O
" O
said O
poor O
Sally B-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
perched O
herself O
on O
a O
low O
stool O
close O
to O

     | O
Fanny B-PERSON
Fletcher I-PERSON

" O
I O

trappings O

     | O
giving O

me O

milk O

but O
it O
will O
make O
no O

in O
the O
end O

Mrs. O

a O
cup O

off O

she O
clasped O
her O

neck O
with O

her O

said O

     | O
Mrs. O
Roberts B-PERSON
, O
interposing O
in O
a O
warning O
tone O
, O
which O
poor O
Sally B-PERSON
seemed O
to O
understand O
, O
for O
though O
|
     | O
her O
breast O
still O
heaved O
with O
a O
panting O
movement O
, O
like O
one O
who O
had O
run O
a O
race O
, O
and O
was O
out O
of O

     | O

she O
assumed O
an O
affected O
air O
of O
composure O

putting O
her O

before O
her O
primly O
, O

" O

The O

Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
ceased O
to O
wonder O
, O
as O
she O
had O
first B-ORDINAL
done O
, O
at O
the O
chartered O
licence O
which O
the O
|
     | O
crazy O
cripple O
seemed O
to O
enjoy O
, O
when O
she O
observed O
the O
perfect O
docility O
with O
which O
she O
obeyed O

     | O
every O
word O
and O
look O
of O
the O
farmer O

wife O

She O
now O
resumed O
her O
story O
, O
exactly O
at O
the O
word O

     | O
commanded O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Yes O
I O
was O

up O

the O

I O
call O
it O

I O
always O
stops O
there O

where O
do O
you O
think O
they O
shut O
me O
up O

this O

or O
t'other O

perhaps O
? O
Not O
a O
bit O
of O
it O
. O
They O
shut O
me O
up O
in O
a O
little O
narrow O

     | O
place O
, O
not O
much O
bigger O

dark O

dark O

all O

one B-CARDINAL
little O
narrow O

there O
was O
no O

comed O
through O

at O
first B-ORDINAL

by O

by O
, O
after O
I O
had O
been O
days O

     | O

days O
locked O

I O
heard O
a O
horrid O
, O
horrid O
lumbering O
noise O
, O

then O
I O
saw O
a O
flash O
of O
light O

     | O
through O
the O
narrow O
slip O
, O
for O
all O
the O
world O

light O
of O
a O

the O
light O

enough O

began O
shaking O
again O

on O
Mrs. O
Roberts B-PERSON
holding O
up O
her O
finger O
, O
she O
seemed O

     | O
to O
make O
a O
strong O
effort O
to O
control O
herself O
, O
and O
once O
more O
slipping O
off O
her O
stool O
she O
drew O
close O

     | O
to O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
, O
and O
in O
a O
low O
rapid O
voice O
, O
hurried O
through O
the O
remainder O
of O
her O

     | O
narrative O

" O

Stiffened B-ORG

stark O

and O
ghastly O
, O

blue O
! O
There O
was O

a O
candle O
that O
flaed O
full O
upon O
her O
dead O
face O

remaining O
perfectly O
still O
for O
a B-TIME

     | I-TIME
minute I-TIME
, O
and O
then O
added O
with O
more O
composure O
, O

growing O
into O
an O
old O
woman O
, O
that O

" O

  | O
Again O
she O
was O
most O
docilely O
obeyed O
, O
and O
in O
another O
moment O
poor O
Sally B-PERSON
was O
gone O
, O
and O
the O
|
     | O
hardworking O
master O
of O
the O
premises O
occupied O
her O
place O
. O
The O
situation O

wants O
of O
his O

     | O
unexpected O
guests O
were O
speedily O
explained O
to O
him O

his O
best O
assistance O

speedly B-NORP
promised O

he O
devoured O

hasty O
supper O

farm O

in O
less B-TIME

an I-TIME
hour I-TIME
after O
his O
return O
, O
the O
comforted O
party O
set O
out O
by O
the O

     | O
light O
of O
a O
friendly O
moon O
, O
and O
were O
safely O
jolted O
to O
the O
King O

Head O
, O
without O
having O
been O

     | O
overtaken O
by O
the O
treacherous O
miller O
, O
who O
probably O
preferred O
sharing O
the O
jovial O
supper O
, O
in O
which O

     | O
his O
good O
friend O
Woodcomb B-PERSON
indulged O
on O
this O
memorable O
evening O

to O
forsaking O
it O

the O
purpose O
of O

     | O
overtaking O
the O
ladies O
, O
from O
whom O
it O
was O
derived O
— O
as O
there O
seemed O

little O
chance O
of O
drawing O

     | O
any O
thing O
more O
from O
the O

source O

Great O
was O
the O
joy O
of O
Mrs. O
Prescot B-PERSON
at O
seeing O
her O
guests O
return O
  O
for O
their O
long O
absence O
, O
|
     | O
together O
with O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
business O
on O
which O
they O
were O
engaged O
had O
caused O
the O
good O
woman O

     | O
to O
torment O
herself O
with O
many O
dark O
forebodings O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
she O
was O
well O
prepared O
to O
receive O

     | O
them O
, O
and O
nothing O
was O
wanting O
that O
she O
could O
furnish O
towards O
refreshing O
the O
adventurers O
after O

     | O
their O
fatigue O
. O
| 
  | O
But O
, O
alas O
! O
it O
was O
only O
then O
  O
it O
was O
only O
after O
the O
anxiety O
, O
and O
the O
agitation O
of O
the O

     | O
enterprise O
were O
over O
, O
that O
poor O
Mary B-PERSON
fully O
remembered O
how O
abortive O
that O
enterprise O
had O
been O
  O
|
     | O
and O
then O
she O
wept O
, O
wept O
bitterly O
, O
as O
she O
thought O
of O
the O
load O
of O
anguish O
she O
had O
to O
carry O
home O

     | O
to O
Michael B-PERSON
's O
mother O

brother O
. O
Yet O
as O
she O
listened O
to O
little O
Fanny B-PERSON

tearful O
narration O
of O
all O

     | O
that O
had O
passed O
between O
them O
, O
during O
the B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
the O
had O
worked O
together O
, O
she O
felt O
that O
when O
the O
|
     | O
first B-ORDINAL
dreadful O
pang O
should O
be O
over O
, O
there O
would O
be O
something O
like O
consolation O
for O
them O
in O
|
     | O
listening O
to O
it O
also O
  O
and O
as O
she O
studied O
the O
delicate O
and O
expressive O
features O
of O
the O
pretty O
|
     | O
creature O
she O
had O
rescued O
, O
and O
watched O
the O
sort O
of O
timid O
, O
doubting O
hope O
, O
that O
by O
degrees O
took O
|
     | O
place O
of O
the O
nervous O
, O
heart O
- O
struck O
look O
, O
that O
had O
been O
so O
painfully O
legible O
in O
her O
sweet O
face O
|
     | O
when O
first B-ORDINAL
she O
saw O
her O
, O
it O
was O
impossible O
not O
to O
feel O
that O
while O
deploring O
the O
loss O
of O
one B-CARDINAL

     | O
object O
of O

that O

It O
was O
alone O

therefore O
, O
that O
Mary B-PERSON

forward O

her O
active O
steps O
soon O
leaving O

the O

the O

her O
way O
through O
the O

     | O
underwood O

she O
soon O
found O
herself O
high O
above O

on O
spot O
of O

After O
lingering O
here O
for O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
she O
proceeded O

when O
hearing O
the O
ever O

     | O
attractive O
sound O
of O
rushing O
waters O
, O
she O
again O
stopped O

then O
, O
guided O
by O
her O
ear O
, O
followed O

     | O
where O
it O
led O

reached O
an O
opening O
, O
not O
far O

the O
high O

road O

apart O

where O
, O
instead O
of O
the O

expected O

a O
spectacle O
greeted O
her O
that O
for O
an O

     | O
instant O
seemed O
to O
petrify O
every O
nerve O

the O
bounding O
elastic O
movement O
which O
had O
brought O
her O

     | O
within O
sight O
of O
it O

was O
changed O
to O
the O
rigid O
stillness O
of O
Marble B-PERSON

A O
man O
, O
almost O
ferocious O
in O

     | O
his O
aspect O

from O
the O
squalid O
, O
unshorn O
, O
brutal O
negligence O
of O
decency O

it O
betrayed O

supporting O

eleven I-DATE

whose O
ghastly O
countenance O

     | O
showed O
plainly O
that O
death O
was O
busy O
at O
his O
heart O

Before O
the O
rock O
from O
whence O
flowed O
the O
gushing O

whose O
sound O
had O
brought O
Miss O

to O
the O
spot O

what O
looked O
like O
the O

     | O
fragment O
of O
a O
rude O
pillar O

on O
this O

wasted O
from O
of O
his O
dying O

child O

Before O
him O
stood O
a O
little O
girl O
gazing O
on O
the O
boy O
with O
a O
mixture O
of O
infant O
fear O
a O

     | O
sisterly O

as O
she O
tended O
a O
bowl O

filled O
from O

to O
his O
lips O

" O
He O

very O
ill O

said O
Mary B-PERSON

addressing O
the O
father O

" O
can O
I O

the O
fragment O
of O
a O
pipe O
in O
his O

and O
who O
looked O
rather O
bewildered O
, O
and O

     | O
fiercely O
angry O
, O
than O
oppressed O
by O
sorrow O
, O
stared O
at O
her O
, O

answered O
not O
a O

" O
What O

the O
matter O

addressing O
the O
little O
girl O

it O
. O
Mother B-PERSON
said O
, O
when O
we O
started O
, O
that O
he O
looked O
as O
if O
he O
'd O
never O
come O
back O

alive O

but O
he O

to O
pay O
double O
fine O
if O
so O
be O
as O
father O
had O
left O
him O
to O
bide O
at O
home O
, O
so O

     | O
he O
carried O
him O
to O
mill O

though O
they O
strapped O
him O

take O
him O

" O

  | O
This O
horrible O
statement O
was O
uttered O
amidst O
tears O
and O
sobs O
, O
but O
poor O
Mary B-PERSON
lost O
not O
a O
word O
of O
|
     | O
it O
  O
and O
as O
her O
very O
soul O
sickened O
at O
the O
tale O
, O
she O
felt O
tempted O
to O
believe O
that O
she O
was O
doomed O
|
     | O
to O
witness O
every O
circumstance O
that O
could O
most O
painfully O
recall O
the O
source O
whence O
all O
her O

     | O
greatness O
flowed O
. O
| 
  | O
With O
clasped O
hands O
, O
and O
streaming O
eyes O
, O
she O
stood O
silently O
watching O
the O
gasping O
breath O
of O
|
     | O
this O
young O
victim O
of O
unnatural O
labour O
. O
The O
boy O
's O
eyes O
fixed O
themselves O
on O
the O
face O
of O
his O
|
     | O
little O
sister O
. O
He O
might O
be O
listening O
to O
her O
history O
of O
his O
early O
fate O
— O
or O
he O
might O
be O

     | O
consciously O
taking O
a O
last O
look O
at O
what O
he O
loved O
. O
In O
either O
case O
the O
effort O
demanded O
more O

     | O
strength O
than O
was O
left O
him O
— O
his O
eyes O
closed O
, O
a O
shivering O
movement O
passed O
through O
all O
his O
|
     | O
frame O
, O
and O
then O
he O
became O
still O
. O
The O
quick O
, O
short O
, O
unequal O
heaving O
of O
the O
breast O
was O
seen O
no O

     | O
more O
, O
and O
Mary B-PERSON
hid O
her O
eyes O
as O
the O
mysterious O
change O
, O
which O
no O
human O
being O
can O
gaze O
upon O
|
     | O
unmoved O
, O
come O
upon O
the O
stiffening O
features O
. O
It O
was O
rather O
instinct O
than O
feeling O
, O
which O
prompted O

     | O
her O
even O
at O
that O
awful O
moment O
to O
proffer O
what O
she O
had O
learned O
to O
know O
would O
be O
felt O
as O

     | O
consolation O

did O
one O
starving O
member O
of O

family O
alone O
survive O
amidst O
the O
dying O

the O
dead O
of O

a O
whole O
race O

Without O
venturing O
again O
to O
look O
at O
the O
father O

his O
son O

dropped O
into O
the O

which O
the O
little O
girl O
still O
held O

what O

soon O
turn O
natural O
sorrow O

into O
unnatural O
forgetfulness O

it O
: O

she O

no O
power O

serve O
them O
more O
effectually O
, O

     | O
hastily O
turning O
into O

, O
that O
Michael B-PERSON
waked O
from O
that O
first B-ORDINAL
sound O
healing O
sleep O
, O
which O
often O
announces O
the O

     | O
conquest O
of O

over O

, O
after O
a O
hard O

fought O
struggle O
between O

. O

  | O
The O
little O
fellow O
raised O
himself O
upright O
on O
his O
straw O
pallet O
, O
and O
for O
a B-TIME
minute I-TIME
or O
two B-CARDINAL
looked O
|
     | O
about O
him O
to O
make O
himself O
quite O
sure O
where O
he O
was O
  O
for O
so O
heavy O
had O
been O
his O
sleep O
that O
it O
was O
|
     | O
not O
immediately O
his O
senses O
could O
recover O
their O
usual O
powers O
of O
perception O
. O
But O
only O
too O
soon O
, O
|
     | O
alas O
! O
he O
made O
it O
all O
out O
. O
He O
was O
still O
in O
that O
foul O
den O
of O
misery O
and O
filth O
  O
and O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
|
     | O
impulse O
of O
his O
fully O
- O
recovered O
intellect O
was O
to O
utter O
a O
bitter O
expression O
of O
regret O
that O
his O
|
     | O
life O
had O
been O
spared O
for O
further O
suffering O
, O
while O
so O
many O
had O
been O
mercifully O
permitted O
to O
sink O
|
     | O
into O
their O
peaceful O
graves O
. O
But O
even O
as O
he O
breathed O
the O
words O
, O
he O
repented O
of O
them O
. O
The O
image O
|
     | O
of O
his O
mother O
seemed O
to O
rise O
before O
him O
— O
he O
remembered O
that O
she O
had O
bade O
him O
ever O
to O
trust O
in O
|
     | O
God O
, O
and O
let O
no O
cause O
tempt O
him O
to O
take O
his O
name O
in O
vain O
. O
The O
quiet O
eye O
of O
his O
much O
- O
enduring O
|
     | O
brother O
rose O
to O
his O
memory O
, O
as O
he O
had O
seen O
it O
a O
thousand B-CARDINAL
times O
fixed O
upon O
him O
, O
while O
he O
|
     | O
enjoined O
patience O

submission O
for O
their O
dear O
mother O

in O
their O
soft O

     | O
pleading O
, O
innocent O
tone O
to O
give O
him O
strength O
to O
bear O

Michael B-PERSON
crossed O
his O
emaciated O
hands O
upon O

     | O
his O
breast O
, O
and O
murmured O
" O
God O

me O

— O
then O
dropping O
again O
into O
a O
gentle O

awoke O

not O

the O
old O
woman O
shook O
him O
rudely O
, O
rather O
for O
the O
gratification O
of O
her O
curiosity O

" O

his O
large O
eyes O
upon O
her O
, O
asked O
her O
to O
please O
to O
be O
so O
kind O
as O

that O

     | O
it O

better O
that O

In O

these O

Michael B-PERSON

withdrawn O

was O
then O

then O
only O
that O
he O
discovered O
the O
heavy O

     | O
loss O
he O
had O
sustained O
by O
the O
departure O
of O
Fanny B-PERSON

While O
employed O

     | O
assigned O
to O
him O
by O
the O

of O
Molly B-PERSON

Mr. O
Woodcomb B-PERSON

the O

No O

no B-TIME

recovered O
his O

her O

At O

much O
as O
he O
preferred O
the O

on O

he O
was O
now O
employed O
to O
that O

     | O
of O
the O

he O
would O
willingly O
, O
nay O
joyfully O

have O
exchanged O
it O
in O
the O
hope O
of O
again O
seeing O

     | O
his O
little O
friend O

It O
was O
therefore O
with O
a O
feeling O
of O
gladness O
, O
instead O
of O
regret O
, O
that O
he O

     | O
received O
orders O

turn O
into O
the O
factory O

  | O
" O
That O
is O
queer O
! O
" O
thought O
the O
little O
fellow O
, O
as O
he O
bounded O
to O
obey O
the O
command O
, O
with O
the O

     | O
double O
energy O
of O
recovered O
health O

awakened O
hope O

" O
it O

queer O

me O

glad O
that O

going O
back O

" O
| 
   | O
had O
worked O
before O
his O
illness O
— O
but O
alas O
! O
when O
he O
turned O
his O
eyes O
to O
the O
spot O

     | O
which O
Fanny B-PERSON
had O
formerly O
occupied O
near O
him O
, O
a O
singularly O
ill O
- O
favoured O
boy O

his O
gaze O
, O
instead O

     | O
of O
the O
pretty O
creature O
he O
sought O
for O
. O
This O
was O
a O
death O
- O
blow O
to O
the O
joy O
which O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
|
     | O
before O
had O
given O
him O
a O
gait O
and O
an O
expression O
of O
countenance O
so O
unwonted O
in O
a O
factory O
- O
boy O
|
     | O
returning O
to O
his O
well O
- O
known O
sufferings O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
though O
a O
tear O
blinded O
the O
eyes O
which O
at O
|
     | O
length O
settled O
reluctantly O
on O
the O
broken O
threads O
which O
awaited O
his O
fingers O
, O
he O
remembered O
that O
|
     | O
the O
factory O
had O
seven B-CARDINAL
floors O
, O
and O
cruel O
as O
it O
was O
to O
lose O
the O
pleasure O
of O
giving O
his O
little O
|
     | O
friend O
a O
look O
or O
a O
word O
as O
they O
each O
paced O
their O
weary O
walk O
, O
he O
still O
thought O
he O
might O
get O
a O
|
     | O
sight O
of O
her O
at O
their O
dismal O
meals O
, O
and O
fancied O
that O
he O
should O
not O
greatly O
regret O
exchanging O
|
     | O
scraps O
of O
wholesome O
meat O
, O
for O
musty O
oatmeal O
, O
provided O
Fanny B-PERSON
Fletcher I-PERSON
was O
by O
to O
tell O
him O
not O
to O
|
     | O
mind O
it O
. O
But O
the O
musty O
oatmeal O
came O
all O
too O
soon O
, O
for O
no O
word O
or O
look O
of O
Fanny B-PERSON
's O
came O
with O
it O
  O
|
     | O
nor O
did O
any O
uncertainty O
long O
remain O
, O
on O
which O
to O
hang O
a O
lingering O
hope O
that O
some O
unfinished O
|
     | O
task O
detained O
her O
in O
the O
mill O
, O
and O
that O
he O
should O
see O
her O
soon O
. O
His O
first B-ORDINAL
question O
, O
whispered O
|
     | O
to O
the O
girl O
who O
sat O
beside O
him O
, O
brought O
forth O
the O
history O
of O
Fanny B-PERSON
's O
wonderful O
departure O
, O
at O
as O
|
     | O
full O
length O
as O
the O
time O
and O
place O
would O
permit O
. O
At O
first B-ORDINAL
he O
listened O
to O
it O
with O
incredulity O
. O
It O
|
     | O
seemed O
, O
he O
thought O
, O
like O
a O
story O
made O
up O
to O
deceive O
him O
for O
fun O
  O
and O
little O
as O
the O
blighted O
|
     | O
young O
spirits O
of O
that O
sad O
fraternity O
were O
given O
to O
jesting O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
clung O
to O
the O
belief O
that O
|
     | O
such O
was O
the O
case O
, O
as O
long O
as O
the O
meal O
lasted O
. O
But O
, O
as O
usual O
, O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
followed O
, O
during O
|
     | O
which O
they O
were O
left O
alone O
— O
an O
indulgence O
which O
necessarily O
arose O
from O
the O
fact O
, O
that O
even O
the O
|
     | O
niggardly O
allowance O
of O
time O
awarded O
by O
the O
regulations O
of O
Mr. O
Elgood B-PERSON
Sharpton I-PERSON
for O
their O
meals O
, O
|
     | O
was O
more O
than O
the O
famished O
children O
required O
for O
devouring O
the O
the O
scanty O
portion O
set O
before O
|
     | O
them O
. O
No O
sooner O
had O
Mr. O
Poulet B-PERSON
withdrawn O
himself O
, O
after O
witnessing O
the O
orderly O
consumption O
by O
|
     | O
each O
, O
of O
the O
allotted O
morsel O
, O
than O
such O
of O
the O
miserable O
crew O
as O
had O
survived O
the O
pestilence O
, O
|
     | O
and O
remembered O
the O
close O
alliance O
between O
Michael B-PERSON
and O
the O
heroine O
of O
the O
marvellous O
tale O
which O
|
     | O
was O
still O
in O
every O
mouth O
, O
all O
rushed O
together O
towards O
him O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
recounting O
it O
. O
|
     | O
Notwithstanding O
the O
confusion O
of O
tongues O
, O
their O
noisy O
testimony O
was O
too O
consistent O
to O
admit O
of O
|
     | O
doubt O
, O
and O
Michael B-PERSON
remained O
with O
the O
astounding O
belief O
that O
his O
little O
friend O
was O
taken O
away O
to O
|
     | O
be O
made O
a O
great O
lady O
of O
. O
|  
   | O
seemed O
" O
lord O
of O
all O
, O
" O
the O
generous O
heart O
of O
Michael B-PERSON
felt O
thankful O
that O
Fanny B-PERSON
|
     | O
Fletcher O
shared O
in O
it O
no O
longer O
. O
It O
had O
been O
quite O
in O
vain O
that O
he O
had O
laboured O
to O
persuade O
|
     | O
himself O
, O
while O
listening O
to O
the O
reasonings O
of O
his O
little O
friend O
, O
that O
they O
ought O
mutually O
to O
|
     | O
rejoice O
in O
the O
probability O
of O
each O
other O
's O
death O
. O
Though O
he O
had O
allowed O
that O
as O
far O
as O
he O
was O
|
     | O
himself O
concerned O
he O
might O
easily O
be O
brought O
to O
think O
that O
it O
would O
be O
a O
comfort O
to O
die O
, O
he O
|
     | O
could O
never O
reach O
the O
pitch O
of O
sublimity O
necessary O
to O
form O
the O
wish O
that O
Fanny B-PERSON
might O
die O
before O
|
     | O
him O
. O
But O
now O
it O
was O
evident O
that O
this O
weakness O
, O
which O
had O
more O
than O
once O
caused O
his O
little O
|
     | O
monitress O
to O
shake O
her O
head O
and O
say O
that O
he O
did O
not O
love O
her O
as O
well O
as O
she O
loved O
him O
, O
it O
was O
|
     | O
now O
quite O
evident O
that O
it O
was O
no O
selfish O
motive O
which O
had O
caused O
it O
. O
|  
  | O
By O
degrees O
this O
truly O
noble O
feeling O
, O
this O
generous O
power O
of O
living O
, O
as O
it O
were O
, O
in O
the O
|
     | O
prosperity O
of O
another O
, O
so O
strengthened O
the O
character O
of O
the O
boy O
, O
as O
perfectly O
to O
save O
him O
from O
|
     | O
that O
worst O
result O
of O
youthful O
suffering O
, O
a O
reckless O
, O
desperate O
despair O
, O
which O
by O
destroying O
|
     | O
hope O
, O
that O
beautiful O
mainspring O
of O
all O
our O
best O
actions O
, O
leaves O
the O
poor O
spiritless O
machine O
|
     | O
alive O
only O
to O
wretched O
consciousness O
of O
its O
capacity O
for O
pain O
. O
It O
is O
, O
beyond O
all O
question O
, O
this O
|
     | O
bitter O
hopelessness O
which O
deteriorates O
in O
so O
remarkable O
a O
manner O
the O
moral O
character O
of O
|
     | O
operatives O
under O
the O
present O
factory O
system O

In O
no O
other O

, O
excepting O
only O
that O
of O

     | O
slaves O
purchased O
and O
paid O
for O
like O
an O
ox O
, O
or O
an O

is O
the O
destiny O
of O
a O
human O
being O
placed O
so O

wholly O

completely O
beyond O

as O
Wordsworth O

" O

blight O
, O
this O
smothering O
mildew O
of O
the O
soul O
fell O
|
     | O
upon O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
for O
he O
seemed O
to O
possess O
a O
sort O
of O
twofold O
existance O
, O
" O
the O
worser O
half B-CARDINAL
of O
it O
, O
" O
|
     | O
being O
his O
poor O
self O
, O
while O
the O
better O
was O
found O
in O
the O
happy O
destiny O
of O
Fanny B-PERSON
. O
Countless O
were O
|
     | O
the O
miles O
that O
he O
walked O
backwards O
and O
forwards O
hefore O
the O
mules O
, O
during O
which O
he O
cheered O
his O
|
     | O
fancy O
by O
painting O
her O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
liberty O
and O
green O
fields O
. O
Sometimes O
he O
thought O
that O
if O
|
     | O
she O
were O
rich O
, O
she O
would O
remember O
all O
he O
had O
told O
her O
about O
his O
mother O
and O
Edward B-PERSON
— O
that O
she O
|
     | O
would O
find O
them O
out O
— O
would O
take O
compassion O
on O
their O
poverty O
— O
would O
talk O
of O
him O
— O
would O
sooth O
|
     | O
and O
comfort O
them O
. O
| 
  | O
All O
this O
may O
seem O
, O
to O
happier O
beings O
, O
but O
a O
frail O
support O
, O
under O
incessant O
labour O
, O
|
     | O
accompanied O
by O
every O
species O
of O
privation O
, O
yet O
it O
did O
Michael B-PERSON
service O
— O
it O
kept O
his O
faculties O
|
     | O
alive O
  O
for O
it O
gave O
a O
theme O
, O
and O
a O
pleasant O
one O
, O
on O
which O
to O
fix O
his O
thoughts O
, O
and O
half B-CARDINAL
the O
the O
|
     | O
tedium O
of O
his O
own O
sad O
life O
was O
forgotten O
, O
as O
he O
meditated O
on O
the O
probable O
happiness O
of O
|
     | O
hers O
. O
| 
  | O
Sometimes O
, O
it O
must O
be O
owned O
, O
— O
though O
he O
always O
told O
himself O
that O
such O
thoughts O
were O
|
     | O
nonsense O
, O
— O
ideas O
would O
suggest O
themselves O
less O
abstractedly O
disinterested O
  O
for O
it O
would O
now O
|
     | O
and O
then O
come O
into O
his O
head O
, O
that O
Fanny B-PERSON
Fletcher I-PERSON
knew O
where O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
had O
sent O
him O
, O
if O
nobody O
|
     | O
else O
did O
  O
and O
that O
, O
perhaps O
, O
if O
she O
grew O
to O
be O
a O
great O
girl O
, O
with O
power O
to O
do O
what O
she O
liked O
, O
|
     | O
she O
might O
think O
of O
him O
, O
and O
try O
to O
do O
something O
to O
rescue O
him O
. O
Vague O
as O
was O
this O
notion O
, O
vague O
|
     | O
as O
he O
himself O
felt O
it O
to O
be O
, O
it O
was O
a O
blessing O
to O
him O
. O
When O
such O
thoughts O
arose O
, O
his O
bodily O
|
     | O
strength O
seemed O
to O
revive O
, O
his O
aching O
knees O
no O
longer O
bent O
under O
him O
, O
his O
gait O
was O
no O
longer O

that O
of O
an O
ordinary O
factory O
- O
child O
, O
the O
energy O
of O
his O
mind O
lent O
itself O
to O
his O
limbs O
, O
and O
wearily O

     | O
as O
he O
stretched O
himself O
upon O
his O
bed O
of O
straw O
, O
and O
long O

lanky O
as O
his O

, O
Michael B-PERSON
Armstrong I-PERSON
did O
not O
become O
a O

  | O
But O
years O
wore O
away O
, O
and O
the O
stout O
- O
hearted O
young O
prisoner O
of O
the B-LOC
Deep I-LOC
Valley I-LOC
began O
again O
to O

     | O
think O
that O
he O
had O
better O
have O
died O
of O
the O

lived O
so O

hoping O
for O

set O
him O

in O
vain O

| 
  | O
" O
I O
am O
a O
fool O
, O
" O
argued O
Michael B-PERSON
at O
fourteen B-DATE
, O
— O
" O
I O
am O
a O
fool O
for O
thinking O
so O
very O
much O
of O
one B-CARDINAL

who O
it O

quite O
plain O

nor O
of O
my O
poor O
Edward B-PERSON
either O
  O

     | O
she O
never O
gave O
a O

to O
either O
of O
us O
! O
I O
was O
a O
fool O

dream O
it O
! O
The O
fine O
folks O
that O
carried O

     | O
her O
away O

took O
her O
far O
enough O
from O
sight O

sound O
of O
factory O

people O
. O
And O
who O
can O
blame O
her O
if O
|
     | O
she O
never O
turned O
her O
head O
back O
again O
to O
inquire O
about O
any O
of O
them O
? O
Poor O
little O
Fanny B-PERSON
! O
She O
was O
|
     | O
very O
kind O
to O
me O
once O
— O
and O
she O
was O
the O
very O
prettiest O
little O
girl O
that O
ever O
I O
happened O
to O
see O
. O
|
     | O
But O
other O
people O
may O

out O
by O
this O

as O

main O
never O

any O

" O
| 
  | O
This O
resolution O
was O
not O
very O
steadily O
adhered O
to O
  O
but O
the O
struggle O
to O
do O
it O
, O
which O
was O
|
     | O
perfectly O
sincere O
, O
made O
the O
poor O
boy O
moody O
, O
and O
more O
miserable O
than O
ever O
. O
His O
dreams O
|
     | O
perpetually O
represented O
to O
him O
his O
mother O
and O
helpless O
brother O
, O
suffering O
from O
some O
unkindness O
|
     | O
from O
Fanny B-PERSON
, O
whom O
he O
saw O
superlatively O
beautiful O
, O
and O
superlatively O
rich O
, O
but O
more O
superlatively O
|
     | O
hard O
- O
hearted O
still O
. O
These O
nervous O
and O
irritating O
visitations O
brought O
his O
mother O
and O
brother O
so O
|
     | O
vividly O
before O
him O
, O
that O
for O
weeks B-DATE
he O
could O
never O
, O
whether O
waking O
or O
sleeping O
, O
get O
them O
out O
of O
|
     | O
his O
head O
. O
He O
fancied O
himself O
again O
running O
at O
full O
speed O
from O
Dowling B-FAC
Lodge I-FAC
, O
with O
Martha B-PERSON
's O

     | O
basket O
on O
his O
arm O
  O
his O
mother O
's O
little O
room O
, O
decent O
and O
orderly O
in O
spite O
of O
poverty O
, O
came O
back O
|
     | O
upon O
his O
mind O
as O
if O
he O
had O
left O
it O
but O
yesterday B-DATE
. O
He O
saw O
the O
soft O
expression O
of O
her O
faded O
|
     | O
countenance O
, O
and O
felt O
the O
welcome O
of O
her O
fond O
embrace O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Oh O
, O
fool O
! O
oh O
, O
proud O
and O
wicked O
fool O
! O
" O
he O
murmured O
to O
his O
tear O
- O
stained O
pillow O
, O
as O
these O
, O
and O
|
     | O
a B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
other O
tender O
recollections O
pressed O
upon O
him O
. O
" O
Why O
could O
I O
not O
endure O
the O
tyrant O
's O

     | O
cruelty O
? O
I O
might O
have O
kissed O
her O
now O
! O
I O
might O
have O
comforted O
poor O
Teddy O
! O
" O
The O
sound O
of O
his O
own O
|
     | O
voice O
as O
he O
pronounced O
this O
dear O
familiar O
name O
, O
though O
in O
a O
whisper O
too O
low O
to O
awaken O
the O
weary O
|
     | O
sleepers O
round O
him O
, O
wrung O
his O
very O
heart O
by O
the O
vivid O
recollections O
which O
it O
brought O
, O
and O
|
     | O
though O
he O
was O
now O
beyond O
fourteen B-DATE
years I-DATE
old I-DATE
, O
he O
cried O
himself O
to O
sleep O
. O
| 
  | O
Fitful B-ORG
and O
feverish O
were O
the O
transitions O
of O
his O
mind O
at O
this O
period O
. O
Sometimes O
he O
persuaded O
|
     | O
himself O
that O
his O
mother O
was O
no O
more O
, O
that O
the O
loss O
of O
him O
had O
broken O
her O
heart O
, O
and O
that O
she O
|
     | O
had O
died O
, O
believing O
him O
to O
have O
gone O
before O
her O
. O
At O
other O
times O
it O
was O
Edward B-PERSON
whom O
he O
wept O
as O
|
     | O
dead O
. O
His O
shattered O
health O
, O
his O
feeble O
limbs O
were O
, O
as O
he O
thought O
, O
sure O
evidence O
that O
nature O
|
     | O
meant O
him O
not O
to O
struggle O
long O
against O
the O
misery O
of O
his O
lot O
, O
and O
there O
were O
moments O
in O
which O
|
     | O
this O
persuasion O
even O
soothed O
him O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Sweet B-PERSON
fellow O
! O
" O
thought O
he O
. O
" O
How O
calm O
and O
beautiful O
he O
must O
have O
looked O
in O
death O
! O
Even O
in O
|
     | O
suffering O
, O
even O
in O
agony O
, O
his O
countenance O
was O
lovely O
— O
so O
patient O
, O
and O
so O
heavenly O
mild O
! O
|
     | O
Better O
, O
far O
better O
he O
should O
die O

than O
live O
a O
factory O
- O
boy O
like O
me O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
And O
then O
again O
his O
mood O
would O
change O
, O
and O
he O
had O
for O
ever O
before O
him O
images O
of O
the O
most O
|
     | O
fearful O
destitution O
— O
his O
mother O
starving O
, O
and O
Edward B-PERSON
slowly O
perishing O
beside O
her O
, O
because O
|
        | O
he O
|  | O
had O
been O
too O
proud O
and O
too O
impatient O
to O
endure O
sundry O
buffetings O
and O
other O
|
     | O
indignities O
, O
which O
, O
when O
put O
in O
competition O
with O
the O
thought O
of O
having O
injured O
them O
, O
dwindled O
|
     | O
into O
petty O
injuries O
, O
which O
he O
deserved O
eternal O
shame O
for O
shrinking O
from O
. O
| 
  | O
Dreadful O
were O
the B-TIME
hours I-TIME
he O
thus O
spent O
! O
and O
, O
fearful O
to O
think O
of O
, O
was O
the O
hopeless O
, O
helpless O
, O
|
     | O
joyless O
, O
comfortless O
existence O
by O
which O
he O
held O
to O
earth O
! O
His O
very O
soul O
sickened O
as O
he O
looked O
|
     | O
around O
him O
, O
and O
read O
in O
every O
withered O
melancholy O
face O
the O
history O
of O
blasted O
youth O
, O
and O
the O
|
     | O
prophecy O
of O
premature O
death O
. O
| 
   | O
had O
been O
stronger O
than O
the O
tendency O
of O
his O
employment O
to O
cripple O
his O
limbs O
, O
and O
|
     | O
he O
was O
neither O
deformed O
nor O
stunted O
. O
This O
happy O
exemption O
from O
the O
common O
lot O
, O
was O
doubtless O
|
     | O
greatly O
owing O
to O
the O
pertinacity O
of O
Molly B-PERSON
Bing I-PERSON
, O
in O
proving O
to O
Messrs. O
Woodcomb B-PERSON

Poulet B-PERSON
that O

     | O
she O
was O
no O
fool O
, O
and O
knew O
well O
enough O
what O
she O
was O
about O
. O
This O
steadfastness O
on O
her O
part O
, O

     | O
acting O
in O
unison O
with O
the O

judicious O
objections O
to O
Michael B-PERSON
's O
being O
buried O
at O

     | O
that O
particular O
time O
, O
had O
certainly O
given O
a O
very O
critical O
and O
efficient O
impulse O
to O
the O
vigour O
|
     | O
of O
a O
frame O
of O
great O
natural O
strength O

comeliness O
. O
The O
energetic O
self O

sustaining O
soul O
within O

     | O
it O
, O
had O
also O
much O
to O
do O
in O
defying O
the O
paralyzing O
influence O
of O
his O
miserable O
situation O

It O
was O

     | O
rarely O
that O
Michael B-PERSON

be O
seen O
to O
drag O
his O

Michael B-PERSON

it O
seemed O
as O
if O
the O

the O

day O

It O

Michael B-PERSON

set O
himself O

He O

near O
trying O
the O

the O

rage O

nothing O

injustice O

the O

the O

too O

Michael B-PERSON
had O
more O
than O

once O
listened O

the O
merry O
tradition O

which O
was O
a O
favourite O
story O
with O
the O

of O
how O

     | O
the O
silly O

had O
run O

till O
her O
strength O
failed O

     | O
she O
sank O
down O
among O
the O
bushes O

was O
taken O

like O
a O

the O
very O

     | O
extremity O

were O
turned O
out O
into O
the O
court O

     | O
to O
wash O
themselves O
, O
the O
whole O
troop O
hurried O
back O
again O
to O
the O
apprentice O

house O
for O
their O

     | O
breakfast O

It O
was O
then O
that O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
often O
the O
last O
to O
finish O
the O
too O
- O
short O
operation O
of O

     | O
washing O
, O
remained O
for O
a O
moment O
behind O
the O
rest O
, O
and O
in O
that O
moment O
, O
opening O
the O
door O
just O
wide O
|
     | O
enough O
for O
his O
slender O
figure O
to O
pass O
, O
he O
slipped O
through O
, O
and O
closed O
it O
after O
him O
. O
| 
   | O
the O
fact O
was O
completely O
ascertained O
and O
known O
to O
nearly O
every O
inmate O
of O
the O
mill O
. O

  | O
Mr. O
Poulet B-PERSON
's O
second B-ORDINAL
wife O
, O
to O
whom O
he O
had O
then O
been O
married O
about B-DATE
three I-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
was O
in O
|
     | O
appearance O
the O
very O
reverse O
of O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
being O
as O
remarkably O
small O
, O
as O
the O
other O
was O
large O
. O
|
     | O
But O
what O
she O
wanted O
in O
muscle O
, O
was O
made O
up O
in O
watchfulness O
. O
Nothing O
escaped O
her O
restless O
and O
|
     | O
malignant O
little O
eyes O
, O
and O
either O
from O
the O
incessant O
danger O
of O
her O
spying O
sharpness O
, O
or O
the O
|
     | O
propensity O
of O
the O
human O
mind O
to O
think O
present O
suffering O
worse O
than O
every O
other O
, O
there O
were O
many O
|
     | O
who O
declared O
they O
would O
be O
glad O
to O
have O
her O
brutal O
predecessor O
back O
again O
. O
It O
was O
this O
woman O
|
     | O
who O
first B-ORDINAL
descried O
the O
absence O
of O
Michael B-PERSON
from O
the O
board O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Hollo O
! O
where O
is O
No O
. O
57 O
? O
" O
she O
cried O
. O
| 
  | O
No O
one O
could O
answer O
  O
and O
No O
. O
57 B-DATE
was O
sought O
for O
in O
vain O
from O
one B-CARDINAL
end O
of O
the O
premises O
to O
the O
|
     | O
other O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
He O
is O
gone O
through O
the O
yard O
- O
door O
! O
" O
proclaimed O
the O
active O
and O
intelligent O
Mrs. O
Poulet B-PERSON
, O
after O
|
     | O
discovering O
that O
the O
bolt O
was O
withdrawn O
. O
" O
Off O
with O
you O
, O
you O
stupid O
old O
fool O
! O
" O
she O
added O
, O
|
     | O
addressing O
her O
husband O
  O
" O
what O
d'ye O
stand O
staring O
there O
for O
? O
If O
you O
had O
the O
wit O
of O
a O
jackass O
, O
|
     | O
you O
might O
trace O
him O
by O
his O
feet O
on O
the O
dew O
— O
for O
there O
are O
the O
marks O
plain O
enough O
to O
any O
body O
, O
|
     | O
that O
has O
sense O
enough O
to O
look O
for O
'em O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
And O
so O
in O
truth O
there O
were O
. O
A O
continuous O
track O
of O
footmarks O
, O
were O
easily O
traced O
from O
the O
door O
|
     | O
to O
the O
steep O
bank O
behind O
the O
factory O
, O
where O
they O
were O
lost O
in O
the O
covert O
of O
bushes O
, O
which O
had O
|
     | O
of O
late B-DATE
years I-DATE
been O
coaxed O
to O
clothe O
its O
sides O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
furnishing O
fagots O
. O
That O
some O
|
     | O
one O
had O
recently O
broken O
through O
these O
bushes O
was O
equally O
evident O
, O
from O
many O
boughs O
having O
been O
|
     | O
torn O
, O
and O
the O
soil O
beneath O
them O
trampled O
. O
This O
was O
enough O
to O
direct O
the O
pursuit O
, O
with O
so O
much O
|
     | O
certainty O
of O
being O
right O
, O
that O
Mr. O
Woodcomb B-PERSON
laughed O
as O
he O
gave O
the O
orders O
for O
it O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
The O
bushes O
last O
for O
about B-QUANTITY
half I-QUANTITY
a I-QUANTITY
mile I-QUANTITY
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
" O
and O
then O
he O
must O
take O
over O
the O
hills O
, O
of O
|
     | O
course O
. O
Fine O
fellow O
, O
is O
n't O
he O
? O
It O
will O
be O
mighty O
hard O
to O
take O
him O
again O
, O
wo O
n't O
it O
? O
There O
's O
only O
|
     | O
three B-CARDINAL
justices O
of O
peace O
for O
him O
to O
be O
handed O
to O
, O
and O
only O
every O
man O
he O
meets O
ready O
to O
introduce O
|
     | O
him O
. O
The O
worst O
misfortune O
is O
, O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
quite O
see O
where O
he O
is O
to O
get O
his O
dinner O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Two B-CARDINAL
stout O
overlookers O
started O
accordingly O
upon O
the O
track O
thus O
easily O
hit O
upon O
, O
and O
Mr. O
|
     | O
Woodcomb B-PERSON
awaited O
the O
result O
of O
their O
exertions O
without O
the O
slightest O
anxiety O
, O
or O
any O
irritation O
|
     | O
of O
nerves O
whatever O
  O
albeit O
he O
knew O
that O
, O
favourite O
as O
he O
was O
, O
he O
might O
run O
no O
small O
risk O
of O
|
     | O
losing O
his O
place O
, O
should O
one O
of O
the O
apprentices O
really O
escape O
— O
but O
the O
thing O
was O
impossible O
  O
|
     | O
no O
one O
could O
live O
without O
eating O
, O
not O
even O
one O
who O
had O
served O
his O
apprenticeship O
to O
starving O
as O

     | O
well O
as O
piecing O
at O
the B-LOC

So O
Mr. O
Woodcomb B-PERSON
slept O
soundly O
, O
although O
in O
ignorance O

of O

   | O
It O
is O

necessary O
that O
the O

There O

no O

and O
the O
communication O
to O
Mrs. O

Edward B-PERSON
of O
the O

Poor O
Mary B-PERSON
had O

     | O
greatly O
advanced O
in O
independence O
of O
spirit O
within O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
few I-DATE
months I-DATE
  O
and O
had O
she O
encountered O

     | O
all O
the O
military O
quartered O
within O
twenty B-QUANTITY
miles I-QUANTITY
, O
with O
the O
Dowling B-PERSON
family O
marching O
in O
procession O

     | O
at O
their O
head O
, O
she O
would O
have O
quietly O
driven O
through O
them O
all O
, O
with O
the O
carriage O
- O
windows O
up O
, O
|
     | O
perhaps O
, O
but O
with O
no O
greater O
precaution O
— O
except O
, O
indeed O
, O
an O
order O
to O
the O
coachman O
to O
drive O
on O

     | O
without O
stopping O
, O
let O
them O
meet O
who O
they O
would O

The O
carriage O
was O
at O
the O
door O
the B-TIME
morning I-TIME
after O
their O
return O
, O
and O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
had O
not O
yet O

     | O
named O
her O
intended O
expedition O
to O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
. O

  | O
" O
You O
are O
going O
out O
without O
me O
, O
my O
dear O

" O
said O
the O
old O
lady O
on O
hearing O
it O
announced O
. O

  | O
" O
I O
am O
going O
to O
the O
widow O

the O
heiress O

" O
Your O
presence O
can O
not O

     | O
help O
me O
through O
this O
dreaded O
visit O

Then O
why O
should O
I O
make O
you O
share O
the O
pain O
of O
it O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Why O
? O
my O
dear O
! O
because O
I O
am O
of O
no O
earthly O
use O

and O
had O
better O
die O
at O
once O
if O
I O
can O
not O
be O
of O

some O
little O
comfort O
to O
you O
at O
such O
a O
time O

do O

I O
know O
all O
about O
it O

how O
you O

must O
feel O
at O
this O
very O
moment O
, O
just O
as O
well O
as O
you O
do O
yourself O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
? O
Sure O
it O
was O
a O
foolish O

     | O
notion O
to O
leave O
me O
here O
enjoying O
the O
arm O
- O
chair O
and O
the O
foot O
- O
stool O
, O
and O
the O
flowers O
, O
while O
you O

     | O
are O
having O
your O
heart O
broken O
by O
telling O
that O
poor O
pale O
body O

that O
the O
child O
she O
loved O
so O
dearly O

me O

I O

Miss O

" O
However O
, O
you O
shall O
go O
with O
me O

quite O

yourself O
to O

it O

in O
truth O

I O

poor O
Fanny B-PERSON

Martin B-PERSON

assisting O
in O

the O
little O

all O

Mrs. O

you O

it O

that O

the O
other O

poor O

I O
'll O
engage O

say O
, O
he O
has O
never O
missed O
school O

an B-TIME

what O
you O
said O

him O

I O
saw O

, O
you O
may O
depend O
upon O
it O
, O
that O

     | O
he O
is O
at O
the O
schoolhouse O
now O

Then O
just O
think O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
what O
his O
going O
home O
will O
be O
after O
you O

     | O
have O
told O
all O
! O
Poor O
creatures O
! O
It O
makes O
one O
's O
heart O
sick O
to O
fancy O
it O
! O
If O
I O
were O
you O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
I O

     | O
would O
send O
for O
him O
, O
tell O
him O
every O
thing O
at O
once O
, O
and O
then O
take O
him O
home O
to O
his O
mother O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
instantly O
rose O
and O
rang O
the O
bell O
. O

  | O
" O
Do O
not O
say O
you O
are O
of O
no O
use O

my O
dear O
good O
creature O
! O
" O
said O
she O
. O
" O
How O
infinitely O
better O
this O
|
     | O
will O
be O
than O
the O
hurried O
, O
thoughtless O
plan O
which O
I O
had O
sketched O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
A O
message O
was O
accordingly O
despatched O
to O
the O
schoolhouse O
to O
summon O
Edward B-PERSON
Armstrong I-PERSON
, O
and O
in O
a B-TIME
|
     | I-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
he O
stood O
before O
them O
. O
| 
  | O
Most O
true O
is O
it O
that O
there O
is O
something O
holy O
and O
imposing O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
sorrow O
. O
It O
would O
|
     | O
be O
difficult O
to O
imagine O
any O
|  | O
entrée O
|  | O
into O
the O
boudoir O
of O
Miss B-PERSON
Brotherton I-PERSON
, O
which O
would O
|
     | O
have O
inspired O
a O
feeling O
both O
in O
her O
and O
her O
friend O
so O
nearly O
approaching O
awe O
, O
as O
did O
that O
of O
|
     | O
Edward B-PERSON
Armstrong I-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
" O
There O
is O
no O
need O
to O
tell O
him O
, O
poor O
fellow O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
, O
mournfully O
shaking O
her O
|
     | O
head O
, O
as O
she O
saw O
the O
sudden O
and O
eloquent O
change O
in O
Edward B-PERSON
's O
countenance O
the O
moment O
he O
looked O
in O
|
     | O
the O
face O
of O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
. O
" O
There O
is O
no O
need O

tell O
him O
! O
He O
knows O
it O
all O
, O
already O
! O
" O

  | O
" O
He O
is O
dead O
, O
then O
! O
" O
said O
the O
boy O
, O
his O
pale O
lips O
parting O
, O
as O
it O
seemed O
, O
with O
difficulty O
, O
to O
|
     | O
pronounce O
the O
words O
, O
" O
Please O
, O
ma'am O
, O
let O
me O
go O
away O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
He O
looked O
as O
if O
he O
were O
unable O
to O
sustain O
himself O
  O
and O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
really O
fearing O
he O
might O
fall O
, O
|
     | O
started O
from O
her O
seat O
, O
and O
throwing O
her O
arms O
round O
him O
, O
almost O
carried O
him O
to O
the O
sofa O
. O

  | O
" O
No O
, O
no O
, O
my O
poor O
Edward B-PERSON

" O
she O
said O
, O
" O
do O
not O

away O

Stay O
with O
those O

love O

     | O
Poor O
Michael B-PERSON

is O

dead O
, O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
and O
we O
must O
all O
try O
to O
support O
your O
mother O
under O
the O
|
     | O
dreadful O
news O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
How O
do O
you O
know O
he O
is O
dead O
? O
" O
cried O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
starting O
up O
, O
and O
looking O
almost O
sternly O
at O
his O
|
     | O
benefactress O
. O
" O
How O
do O
you O
know O
that O
they O
have O
not O
hid O
him O
away O
where O
you O
can O
not O
find O
him O
, O
that O

     | O
they O
may O
torture O
him O
, O
and O
work O
him O
to O
the O
bone O
, O
when O
there O
is O
nobody O
by O
to O

" O
I O
know O
that O
he O
is O
dead O

too O
well O

Edward B-PERSON
, O
" O
replied O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
gently O
. O
" O
I O
have O
brought O
home O

     | O
with O
me O
a O
little O
girl O
who O
worked O
in O
the O
same O
factory O
, O
and O
who O
knew O
him O
well O

He O
died O
of O
an O

     | O
infectious O
fever O
that O
killed O
many O
, O
many O
more O
. O
I O
am O
going O
to O
take O
this O
little O
girl O
with O
me O
to O
|
     | O
your O
mother O
, O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
that O
she O
may O
question O
her O
, O
if O
she O
wishes O
it O
, O
about O
poor O
Michael B-PERSON

and O
I O

     | O
wish O
you O
to O
go O
with O
us O
, O
my O
dear O
boy O

is O
better O
that O
your O
poor O
mother O
should O
have O
you O
with O

her O

  | O
" O
You O
are O
going O

tell O
mother O

said O
the O
boy O
with O
a O
shudder O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Yes O
, O
Edward B-PERSON
! O
— O
It O
must O
be O
done O
, O
and O
the O
sooner O
it O
is O
over O
the O
better O
. O
Your O
mother O
is O
a O
good O

     | O
woman O
, O
and O
a O
pious O
Christian B-NORP
, O
my O
dear O
boy O

She O
will O
know O
and O
feel O
that O
all O
that O
can O
befall O
her O

     | O
is O
the O
will O
of O
God O
  O
and O
when O
she O
remembers O
this O
, O
she O
will O
rise O
above O
her O
sorrow O
, O
and O
thinking O
|
     | O
of O
the O
better O
world O
hereafter O
, O
will O
be O
able O

Yes O

ma'am O
— O
if O
it O
does O
not O
kill O
her O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
" O
answered O
Edward B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Indeed O
, O
I O
think O
a O
great O
deal O
will O
depend O
on O
you O
, O
dear O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
as O
to O
her O
manner O
of O
bearing O

     | O
it O
. O
If O
she O
sees O
you O
sink O
, O
be O
sure O
she O
will O
sink O
too O
  O
but O
if O
you O
make O
her O
feel O
that O
she O
has O

     | O
still O
a O
beloved O
child O
to O
live O
for O
, O
to O
whom O
life O
may O
yet O
be O
a O
blessing O
, O
she O
will O
cease O
to O
repine O
|
     | O
for O
the O
loss O
of O
one B-CARDINAL
child O
, O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
making O
the O
other O
happy O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Edward B-PERSON
slowly O
and O
silently O
shook O
his O
head O
  O
but O
after O
the O
melancholy O
silence O
of O
a O
minute O
or O

     | O
two B-CARDINAL

The O
scene O
which O
followed O
beside O
the O
bed O
of O
the O
poor O
widow O
, O
was O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
such O
deep O
, O
but O
patient O

     | O
sorrow O
, O
as O
left O
an O
impression O
never O
to O

forgotten O
on O
the O
minds O
of O
those O
who O
witnessed O
it O

     | O
Mary B-PERSON
's O
counsel O
had O
not O
been O
thrown O
away O
upon O
Edward B-PERSON
. O
The O
boy O
displayed O
both O
a O
delicacy O
and O

     | O
firmness O
of O
character O
beyond O
his O
years O
, O
and O
above O
his O
education O
. O
No O
ordinary O
topics O
of O

     | O
consolation O
were O
clumsily O
uttered O
to O
redeem O
his O
pledge O
to O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
nor O
did O
he O
affect O
a O
stoical O

     | O
indifference O
which O
he O
could O
not O
feel O
  O
but O
with O
gentle O
endearments O
he O
drew O
the O
mourning O
mother O
|
     | O
to O
think O
of O
him O
, O
and O
there O
was O
healing O
, O
as O
well O
as O
agony O
, O
in O
the O
tears O
she O
shed O
upon O
his O

bosom O

Of O
all O

a O
silent O

moved O

The O
widow O
gave O
her O
one O
earnest O

     | O
look O
when O
Mary B-PERSON
said O
, O

little O

was O

upon O

no O

spoken O

her O

for O

the O

in O
her O
ear O

" O

Mary B-PERSON
nodded O
her O
assent O

     | O
left O

Martha B-PERSON

it O
was O
a O
heavy O

miserable O

indeed O

the B-DATE

  O
from O

painful O

useless O
visit O

Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
, O
her O
|
     | O
eyes O
had O
been O
, O
in O
a O
great O
degree O
, O
opened O
to O
the O
hard O
and O
avaricious O
nature O
of O
her O
father O
's O
|
     | O
character O
. O
Like O
a O
person O
excluded O
from O
the O
light O
of O
the O
sun O
, O
and O
seeing O
only O
by O
the O
delusive O

     | O
glare O
of O
an O
unsteady O
lamp O
, O
Martha B-PERSON
had O
passed O
her O
whole O
life O
in O
mistaking O
the O
nature O
and O
the O

     | O
value O
of O
almost O
every O
object O
around O
her O
. O
The O
language O
of O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton I-PERSON
had O
shot O
with O
a O
|
     | O
painful O
and O
unwelcome O
brightness O
upon O
the O
dim O
and O
uncertain O
twilight O
of O
her O
moral O
perceptions O
  O

     | O
and O
the O
unhappy O
girl O
learned O
to O
know O
that O
the O
only O
being O
who O
had O
ever O
seemed O
to O
love O
her O
, O
or O
|
     | O
whom O
she O
had O
ever O
ventured O
to O
love O
, O
was O
one O
that O
her O
better O
reason O
shrunk O
from O
, O
and O
her O
sober O
|
     | O
judgment O
condemned O
. O
| 
   | O
to O
watch O
some O
favourable O
moment O
, O
she O
might O
have O
the O
surpassing O
joy O
of O
seeing O
his O
|
     | O
heart O
open O
to O
the O
truth O
, O
and O
in O
a O
state O
to O
permit O
her O
helping O
to O
lead O
him O
to O
efficient O
|
     | O
repentance O
, O
and O
the O
all O
- O
merciful O
forgiveness O
of O
God O
. O
It O
was O
impossible O
but O
that O
such O
thoughts O
|
     | O
and O
feelings O
must O
separate O
her O
, O
more O
than O
ever O
, O
from O
the O
rest O
of O
her O
family O
, O
and O
she O
had O
|
     | O
already O
pretty O
generally O
received O
the O
epithet O
of O
|  | O
methodistical O
|  | O
, O
from O
the O
whole O
|
     | O
neighbourhood O
  O
but O
she O
hailed O
it O
as O
a O
blessing O
, O
and O
without O
a O
shadow O
of O
religious O
enthusiasm O
, O
|
     | O
beyond O
what O
was O
almost O
inevitable O
under O
the O
circumstances O
, O
and O
with O
no O
sectarian O
views O
or O
|
     | O
notions O
whatever O
, O
poor O
Martha B-PERSON
gladly O
sheltered O
herself O
under O
the O
imputation O
of O
both O
in O
order O
to O
|
     | O
avoid O
joining O
in O
scenes O
of O
amusement O
for O
which O
she O
had O
no O
relish O
. O
|  
  | O
In O
such O
a O
state O
of O
mind O
it O
was O
natural O
enough O
that O
Martha B-PERSON
should O
deem O
a O
visit O
to O
the O
bereaved O
|
     | O
mother O
a O
penance O
which O
it O
was O
her O
duty O
to O
perform O
( O
though O
it O
was O
more O
painful O
to O
her O
, O
perhaps O
, O
|
     | O
than O
almost O
any O
other O
to O
which O
she O
could O
have O
been O
subjected O
) O
, O
and O
she O
did O
perform O
it O
|
     | O
accordingly O
. O
She O
found O
the O
poor O
sufferer O
, O
whose O
eye O
she O
dreaded O
to O
meet O
, O
sinking O
fast O
into O
|
     | O
peace O
and O
rest O
, O
that O
never O
more O
could O
be O
disturbed O
. O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
and O
Fanny B-PERSON
were O
both O
with O

     | O
her O
  O
a O
bible O
was O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
former O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Armstrong B-PERSON
's O
countenance O
, O
though O
greatly O
|
     | O
more O
pinched O
and O
pallid O
than O
she O
had O
ever O
before O
seen O
it O
, O
expressed O
a O
tranquil O
calmness O
which O
|
     | O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
contemplate O
without O
pleasure O
. O
| 
  | O
But O
, O
alas O
! O
for O
poor O
Martha B-PERSON
! O
she O
had O
the O
pang O
of O
seeing O
this O
consoled O
and O
consoling O
look O
|
     | O
suddenly O
changed O
to O
an O
expression O
of O
intense O
suffering O
, O
the O
moment O
her O
own O
person O
met O
the O
poor O
|
     | O
woman O
's O
eye O
. O
They O
had O
never O
seen O
each O
other O
since O
the B-TIME
fatal I-TIME
morning I-TIME
on O
which O
Martha B-PERSON
had O
so O
|
     | O
innocently O
persuaded O
her O
to O
sign O
the O
articles O
of O
her O
boy O
's O
apprenticeship O
, O
and O
the O
recollection O
|
     | O
of O
that O
scene O
, O
and O
all O
its O
consequences O
, O
could O
not O
so O
suddenly O
come O
upon O
one O
, O
reduced O
already O
|
     | O
to O
almost O
the O
last O
stage O
of O
weakness O
, O
without O
shaking O
her O
terribly O
. O
The O
distended O
eye O
, O
the O
open O
|
     | O
mouth O
, O
the O
heaving O
breast O
, O
all O
spoke O
a O
degree O
of O
agitation O
, O
which O
in O
her O
condition O
was O
|
     | O
frightfully O
alarming O
  O
and O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
who O
dreaded O
lest O
the O
calmness O
of O
her O
last O
moments O
should O
be O
|
     | O
disturbed O
, O
hastily O
turned O
to O
the O
intruder O
, O
and O
said O
, O
" O
Go O
, O
go O
! O
— O
the O
sight O
of O
you O
will O
kill O

her O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
Though O
there O
was O
no O
more O
of O
harshness O
in O
this O
, O
than O
the O
urgent O
circumstances O
of O
the O
case O
|
     | O
seemed O
to O
call O
for O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton I-PERSON
would O
have O
rather O
died O
than O
utter O
it O
, O
could O
she O
have O
|
     | O
guessed O
the O
pang O
it O
gave O
to O
the O
already O
wounded O
heart O
of O
poor O
Martha B-PERSON
. O
She O
made O
no O
reply O
  O
but O
, O
|
     | O
fixing O
on O
the O
victim O
of O
her O
most O
innocent O
delusion O
, O
a O
look O
, O
just O
long O
enough O
to O
impress O
the O
|
     | O
terrible O
expression O
of O
her O
countenance O
upon O
her O
own O
heart O
for O
ever O
, O
she O
turned O
away O
, O
and O
|
     | O
reached O
her O
splendid O
home O
in O
a O
state O
of O
mind O
that O
seemed O
fearfully O
to O
verify O
the O
annunciation O
, O
|
     | O
" O
He O
will O
visit O
the O
sins O
of O
the O
fathers O

" O
| 
   | O
her O
death O
, O
and O
the O
time O
of O
it O
, O
with O
sufficient O
accuracy O
to O
leave O
no O
doubt O
on O
|
     | O
Martha B-PERSON
's O
mind O
, O
that O
the O
event O
had O
been O
accelerated O
by O
her O
appearance O
. O

  | O
Happily O
, O
however O
, O
for O
those O
who O
tenderly O
watched O
her O
last O
moments O
, O
the O
widow O
Armstrong B-PERSON
's O
|
     | O
gentle O
nature O
permitted O
her O
not O
long O
to O
suffer O
from O
the O
irritation O
which O
the O
presence O
of O
Martha B-PERSON
|
     | O
produced O
, O
and O
many B-TIME
hours I-TIME
before O
she O
closed O
her O
eyes O
for O
ever O
, O
she O
expressed O
her O
sorrow O
for O
|
     | O
having O
yielded O
so O
weakly O
to O
feelings O
which O
she O
had O
hoped O
were O
altogether O
conquered O
  O
assuring O
|
     | O
Mary B-PERSON
( O
who O
never O
left O
her O
) O
that O
she O
acquitted O
the O
young O
lady O
of O
all O
intention O
to O
deceive O
her O
, O

     | O
and O
that O
the O
shock O
she O
felt O
from O
seeing O
her O
, O
only O
proceeded O
from O
the O
vivid O
recollections O
her O

     | O
appearance O
awakened O
. O

Unhappily O
, O
however O
, O
it O
was O
long O
ere O
this O
healing O
assurance O
reached O
poor O
Martha B-PERSON
  O
for O
Miss B-PERSON

     | I-PERSON
Brotherton I-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
far O
from O
guessing O
its O
importance O
to O
her O
, O
had O
decided O
upon O
having O
no O
further O

     | O
intercourse O
with O
the O
Dowling B-PERSON
family O
: O
a O
resolution O
which O
would O
never O

had O
her O

     | O
last O
interview O
with O
Martha B-PERSON
at O
Milford B-FAC
Park I-FAC
ended O
more O
pleasantly O
. O
But O
it O
had O
been O
already O
so O

     | O
long O
acted O
upon O
, O
that O
it O
would O
have O
been O
equally O
awkward O
and O
disagreeable O
to O
break O
through O
it O
  O
|
     | O
and O
Martha B-PERSON
long O
continued O
in O
the O
terrible O
persuasion O
that O
she O
had O
been O
accessory O
to O
the O
death O

     | O
of O
both O

for O
several B-DATE
months I-DATE
after O
her O
return O

contented O
herself O
with O

     | O
following O
Mr. O
Bell B-PERSON

prescriptions O

for O
friction O

moderate O
exercise O
, O
without O
calling O
in O
any O

     | O
medical O
assistance O
at O
all O
. O
But O
though O
the O
improvement O
that O
followed O
was O
very O
perceptible O
, O
it O
|
     | O
was O
not O
rapid O
, O
and O
the O
idea O
of O
London B-GPE
advice O
suggested O
itself O

as O
the O
most O
satisfactory O
mode O
of O

ascertaining O
at O

very O
desirable O

him O
up O

Since O

she O
at O

Mary B-PERSON

about B-DATE
twenty I-DATE

two I-DATE

old I-DATE
, O
extremely O
pretty O

moreover O

     | O
almost O
childishly O
young O
- O
looking O
for O
her O
age O
  O

whatever O
she O
might O
have O
brought O
herself O
to O

     | O
think O
of O
it O
, O
most O

would O
very O
naturally O
have O
deemed O
her O
adopting O
a O
boy O
of O
twelve B-CARDINAL
, O

a O

     | O
girl O
of O
eleven B-DATE
, O
a O
most O
outrageously O
preposterous O

imprudent O
act O
. O
But O
her O
situation O
was O
one O

     | O
in O
most O
respects O
quite O
out O
of O
the O
common O
way O
, O
and O
she O
every O
day O
felt O
it O
more O
impossible O
that O

     | O
she O
could O
continue O

the O

her O
whole O

recoiling O

the O

would O
deem O

     | O
fit O
to O
be O
her O

   | O
that O

duty O

Mr. O

, O
if O

remedy O
the O

evils O
under O
which O
they O
groaned O

she O

stripping O
herself O

her O
last O
shilling O

As O
to O
her O

the O
answer O
was O
less O
unanimous O
  O
two B-CARDINAL

     | O
gentlemen O

of O
opinion O
that O

would O

all O

it O
was O
doubtful O

as O
all O

great O
faith O
in O
his O

but O
he O
had O
faith O
too O

in O

     | O
the O
impossibility O
of O
begging O
at O
a O

in O

nor O
did O

     | O
either O
hope O

: O
he O
walked O
till O
nightfall B-TIME
with O
no O
other O
refreshment O
than O
water O
, O
caught O

     | O
in O
the O
hollow O
of O
his O
hand O
from O
a O
trickling O
road O

side O
spring O
, O
and O
a O
few O
blackberries O
, O
snatched O
|
     | O
in O
terror O
, O
as O
he O
hurried O
on O
. O
| 
  | O
As O
the O
darkness O
thickened O
round O
him O
, O
he O
called O
a O
counsel O
with O
himself O
, O
as O
to O
whether O
it O
would O
|
     | O
be O
wisest O
to O
lay O
down O
under O
the O
shelter O
of O
a O
hay O

, O
and O
let O
sleep O
serve O
him O
for O
supper O
, O
or O
|
     | O
to O
venture O
a O
petition O
for O
a O
morsel O
of O
food O
at O
a O
decent O
- O
looking O
mansion O
which O
he O
saw O
at O
some O
|
     | O
distance O
, O
and O
walk O
on O
through O
the O
night O
, O
if O
he O
succeeded O
, O
by O
help O
of O
the O
strength O
so O
|
     | O
recruited O
. O
| 
  | O
After O
many O
anxious O
reasonings O
, O
pro O
and O
con O
, O
he O
at O
last O
decided O
upon O
the O
latter O
, O
and O
so O
well O
|
     | O
did O
his O
handsome O
face O
and O
simple O
assurance O
that O
he O
was O
very O
hungry O
, O
plead O
for O
him O
, O
that O
he O
not O
|
     | O
only O
obtained O
scraps O
sufficient O
for O
a O
hearty O
supper O
, O
but O
a O
crust O
or O
two B-CARDINAL
for O
the O
following O
|
     | O
morning O
  O
and O
with O
this O
treasure O
he O
trudged O
on O
, O
footsore O
indeed O
, O
and O
with O
a O
pretty O
strong O
|
     | O
inclination O
to O
lie O
down O
and O
sleep O
, O
but O
mental O
energy O
sufficed O
for O
many B-TIME
hours I-TIME
to O
conquer O
bodily O
|
     | O
fatigue O
, O
and O
it O
was O
not O
till O
past B-TIME
three I-TIME
o'clock I-TIME
the B-TIME
next I-TIME
morning I-TIME
, O
that O
he O
yielded O
, O
and O
at O
last O
|
     | O
laid O
himself O
down O
in O
a O
dry O
, O
and O
, O
as O
he O
thought O
it O
, O
most O
delightfully O
comfortable O
ditch O
, O
and O
|
     | O
slept O
the O
sleep O
of O
youth O
and O
weariness O
for O
three B-TIME
four I-TIME
hours I-TIME
. O
The O
bright O
beams O
of O
an O
autumn O
sun O
|
     | O
shooting O
directly O
upon O
his O
eyes O
awakened O
him O
, O
and O
he O
started O
up O
, O
ready O
and O
able O
to O
walk O
|
     | O
forward O
, O
sufficiently O
thankful O
for O
the O
hoarded O
crusts O
in O
his O
pocket O
. O
| 
   | O
commending O
himself O
to O
God O
, O
he O
set O
off O
at O
the O
fleetest O
pace O
he O
could O
achieve O
, O
|
     | O
towards O
Ashleigh B-PERSON
. O
|  
  | O
No O
symptom O
of O
pursuit O
, O
however O
, O
alarmed O
him O
. O
From O
the O
moment O
he O
quitted O
the O
mills O
, O
to O
that O
|
     | O
when O
he O
reached O
what O
had O
once O
been O
his O
mother O
's O
door O
, O
no O
terror O
of O
the O
kind O
had O
come O
near O
him O
  O
|
     | O
he O
had O
heard O
no O
whispering O
voices O
, O
nor O
seen O
shadowy O
figures O
stealing O
towards O
him O
from O
a O
|
     | O
distance O
. O
All O
he O
had O
most O
feared O
was O
got O
through O
with O
ease O
  O
but O
all O
he O
had O
most O
fondly O
hoped O
, O
|
     | O
turned O
out O
a O
fearful O
blank O
. O
| 
  | O
As O
Michael B-PERSON
drew O
near O
the O
door O
, O
he O
remembered O
so O
well O
every O
object O
which O
met O
his O
eye O
, O
that O
he O
|
     | O
began O
to O
fear O
lest O
he O
himself O
might O
be O
remembered O
by O
others O
, O
and O
making O
a O
circuit O
to O
avoid O
Sir O
|
     | O
Matthew B-PERSON
's O
mills O
, O
he O
reached O
Hoxley B-ORG
- O
lane O
without O
having O
met O
a O
single O
face O
he O
knew O
. O
| 
  | O
It O
was O
a O
tremendous O
moment O
for O
him O
, O
that O
in O
which O
he O
first B-ORDINAL
caught O
sight O
of O
the O
lowly O
door O
|
     | O
through O
which O
he O
had O
passed O
a O
thousand B-CARDINAL
times O
in O
eager O
anticipation O
of O
his O
mother O
's O
kiss O
! O
Some B-TIME
|
     | I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
followed O
before O
he O
could O
reach O
it O
, O
and O
the O
boy O
trembled O
so O
violently O
that O
he O
tottered O
|
     | O
as O
he O
hurried O
onward O
, O
like O
a O
drunken O
man O
. O
| 
  | O
At O
length O
his O
hand O
was O
on O
the O
latch O
  O
it O
yielded O
as O
in O
days B-DATE
of O
yore O
, O
and O
in O
an O
instant O
the O
|
     | O
door O
was O
wide O
open O
before O
him O
. O
Poor O
Michael B-PERSON
! O
what O
death O
can O
have O
a O
pang O
so O
bitter O
as O
that O
he O
|
     | O
felt O
, O
when O
the O
almost O
impossible O
project O
of O
reaching O
his O
mother O
's O
home O
being O
performed O
, O
he O
|
     | O
found O
that O
home O
empty O
and O
desolate O
, O
and O
telling O
him O
as O
plainly O
as O
angels O
trumpet O
- O
tongued O
could O
|
     | O
do O
, O
that O
she O
was O
dead O
! O
| 
  | O
A O
dismal O
groan O
burst O
from O
him O
, O
and O
he O
sunk O
on O
the O
floor O
, O
just O
where O
he O
had O
last O
stood O
gaily O
|
     | O
talking O
to O
her O
of O
his O
bright O
fancies O
for O
the O
future O
, O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
hours I-TIME
before O
he O
was O
snatched O
away O
|
     | O
from O
her O
for O
ever O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
noise O
he O
made O
reached O
the O
ears O
of O
a O
woman O
in O
the O
front O
room O
, O
and O
she O
opened O
the O
door O
of O
|
     | O
communication O
to O
ascertain O
who O
it O
could O
be O
, O
rummaging O
in O
the O
empty O
room O
that O
was O
" O
to O
let O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
My O
gracious O
! O
I O

" O

  | O
This O
was O
said O
by O
a O
young O
and O
pretty O
woman O
who O
held O
a O

in O
her O

who O
being O
the O
wife O

12 B-CARDINAL

upon O
the O

     | O
death O
of O
Mrs. O
Sykes B-PERSON

the O
dispersion O
of O
her O

considered O
herself O
privileged O

on O
most O

an O

importance O

" O
Mother O

here O

" O
said O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
look O
wretched O
enough O
to O
soften O
the O
heart O
of O
the O

     | O
saucy O
girl O
who O

deal O

about O
the O
widow O

" O

" O
|

" O
Sure O
- O
ly O
he O
is O

" O
replied O
the O
unthinking O
young O
woman O
, O
who O
, O
in O
truth O
, O
knew O
nothing O
about O
either O
|
     | O
the O
widow O
Armstrong B-PERSON
or O
her O
son O
, O
but O
remembered O
hearing O
that O
a O
little O
more O
than O
a O
year O
before O
|
     | O
she O
took O
possession O
of O
the O
premises O
, O
a O
widow O
Armstrong B-PERSON
had O
died O
in O
the O
back O
room O
, O
for O
grief O
at O
|
     | O
having O
lost O
a O
boy O
. O
She O
was O
far O
from O
intending O
to O
be O
cruel O
to O
the O
poor O
lad O
, O
who O
looked O
himself O
|
     | O
so O
very O
nearly O
like O
a O
corpse O
, O
but O
was O
too O
indifferent O
upon O
all O
subjects O
which O
did O
not O
|
     | O
immediately O
concern O
herself O
, O
to O
take O
the O
trouble O
of O
thinking O
before O
she O
spoke O
. O
| 
  | O
A O
few O
more O
questions O
might O
probably O
have O
obtained O
, O
if O
not O
the O
truth O
, O
at O

some O
proof O
of O

     | O
his O
informer O

ignorance O
of O
it O
, O
but O
Michael B-PERSON
had O
heard O
enough O
  O
he O
rose O
to O
his O
feet O
, O
and O
without O

     | O
uttering O
another O
word O
, O
rushed O
out O
of O
the O
room O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
state O
in O
which O
he O
then O
found O
himself O
was O
certainly O
nearly O
approaching O
to O
delirium O
. O
His O

     | O
strength O
of O
body O

mind O
completely O
exhausted O
by O
fatigue O

intense O
anxiety O
, O
the O
|
     | O
blow O
which O
had O
fallen O
upon O
him O
was O
heavier O
than O
his O
reason O
could O
bear O
, O
and O
he O
wandered O
forth O

     | O
into O
the O
fields O
without O
knowing O
where O
he O
was O

any O

idea O

befallen O

     | O
him O
. O
His O
devious O
and O
unheeded O
path O
led O
him O
to O
a O
spot O
, O
at O
the O
distance O
of O
nearly B-QUANTITY
a I-QUANTITY
mile I-QUANTITY
from O
his O

     | O
former O
home O
, O
at O
which O
several O
miniature O
rocks O
of O
sandstone O
give O
something O
of O
wildness O
and O

     | O
dignity O
to O
the O
little O
stream O
, O
which O
for O
the O
most O
part O
runs O
tamely O
enough O
, O
and O
looks O
little O
more O

     | O
than O
a O
wide O
and O
dirty O
ditch O
, O
as O
it O
passes O
through O
the O
town O
of O

A O
multitude O
of O

cotton O

visible O
in O
the O
distance O

     | O
on O
the O
other O
side O

and O
the O
boy O
stopped O
in O
his O
wild O
, O
hurried O
walk O
, O
to O
gaze O
upon O
them O
, O
with O
a O

     | O
feverish O
consciousness O
that O
there O
at O

stood O
something O
he O
had O
seen O
before O
. O
A O
frightful O

     | O
flash O
of O
memory O

shot O
across O
his O
brain O

dead O
— O

     | O
himself O
a O
houseless O
, O
friendless O
, O
starving O
wretch O
, O
who O
soon O
would O
be O
caught O
and O
carried O
back O
to O
|
     | O
the O
prison O
- O
house O
he O
had O
ran O
from O
only O
to O
learn O
that O
he O
had O
no O
friend O
on O
earth O
! O
Such O
were O
the O
|
     | O
thoughts O
which O
racked O
him O
, O
as O
he O
stood O
upon O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
rocky O
little O
precipice O
, O
and O
fixed O
|
     | O
his O
eyes O
upon O
the O
quite O
water O
that O
flowed O
some B-QUANTITY
twenty I-QUANTITY
feet I-QUANTITY
beneath O
him O
. O
It O
seemed O
to O
present O
an O
|
     | O
image O
of O
coolness O
and O
repose O
  O
his O
burning O
lips O
longed O
to O
kiss O
the O
gentle O
ripple O
on O
its O
surface O
|
     | O
— O
he O
drew O
nearer O
to O
the O
extremest O
verge O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
should O
be O
safe O
there O
! O
" O
he O
murmured O
, O
looking O
downwards O
till O
his O
sick O
head O
reeled O
. O
" O
God O
|
     | O
forgive O
me O
! O
" O
he O
added O
, O
raising O
his O
eyes O
to O
heaven O
. O
" O
But O
if O
I O
drown O
, O
mother O
! O
I O
shall O
go O
to O
|
     | O
thee O
! O
" O
and O
as O
he O
spoke O
the O
words O
, O
he O
sprang O
forward O
, O
and O
plunged O
into O
the O
stream O
! O
| 
   | O
himself O
and O
the O
object O
he O
endeavoured O
to O
reach O
. O
His O
heavy O
shoes O
filled O
with O
|
     | O
water O
, O
and O
dragged O
him O
downwards O
— O
his O
strength O
failed O
, O
his O
arms O
ceased O
to O
move O
, O
and O
in O
another O
|
     | O
moment O
the O
water O
rippled O
over O
his O
head O
. O

  | O
But O
poor O
Michael B-PERSON
's O
history O
was O
not O
finished O
yet O
. O
A O
heavy O
- O
looking O
elderly O
man O
, O
who O
had O
as O

     | O
little O
as O
possible O
the O
air O
of O
one B-CARDINAL
desirous O
of O
seeking O
an O
adventure O
, O
was O
in O
the O
act O
of O
examining O

     | O
some O
sheep O
in O
a O
field O
, O
the O
fence O
of O
which O
was O
not O
fifty B-QUANTITY

from O
the B-FAC
rocky I-FAC

from O
whence O

     | O
the O
boy O
had O
sprung O
. O
Having O
completed O
his O
survey O
, O
and O
directed O
two B-CARDINAL
men O
who O
were O
with O
him O
to O
|
     | O
select O
a O
score O
or O
two B-CARDINAL
from O
the O
lot O
, O
the O
old O
man O
reposed O
himself O
upon O
a O
style O
in O
the O
fence O
above O

     | O
mentioned O
, O

having O
chanced O
to O
turn O
his O
head O
from O
the O
sheep O
, O
towards O
the O
spot O
where O
Michael B-PERSON

     | O
stood O
, O
had O
watched O
for O
a B-TIME
minute I-TIME
or O
two B-CARDINAL
the O
boy O
's O
agitated O
movements O
and O
demeanour O
, O
but O
without O

     | O
the O
slightest O
suspicion O
of O
the O
frightful O
catastrophe O
that O
was O
to O
ensue O
. O

  | O
No O

, O
however O
, O
did O
he O
hear O
the O
splash O
occasioned O
by O
the O
plunge O
, O
than O
he O
sprang O
over O
the O

     | O
style O
with O
the O
activity O
of O
a O
younger O
man O
, O
and O
calling O
to O
the O
others O
to O
follow O
him O
, O
made O
his O
way O

     | O
with O
little O
loss O
of O
time O
, O
to O
a O
bit O
of O
pebbly O
ground O
on O
a O

from O
the O
point O
at O
which O
Michael B-PERSON
had O
sunk O

But O
, O
short O
as O
the O
time O
had O
been O
, O
the O
ripple O

     | O
had O
already O
disappeared O
from O
the O
surface O

no O

the O

his O
search O

The O
two B-CARDINAL
young O
men O

he O
had O
summoned O
to O
follow O
him O
, O
though O
they O
had O
not O
seen O
the O
|
     | O
accident O
, O
had O
gathered O
from O
his O
words O
that O
something O
terrible O
had O
occurred O
, O
and O
clambering O
down O

the O
rocky O

" O

exclaimed O
the O

wringing O
his O

I O
saw O

he O

Before O
the O

Westmorland B-ORG

for O
Michael B-PERSON

the O

saved O
from O
drowning O
some B-DATE

     | I-DATE
thirty I-DATE
years I-DATE
before O

he O
remembered O
enough O
of O
the O
process O

had O
then O
witnessed O
, O
to O
enable O

     | O
him O
to O
give O
some O
very O
useful O
instructions O
on O
the O
present O
occasion O

They O
managed O
to O
make O
their O

     | O
patient O
discharge O
from O
his O
mouth O
some O
portion O
of O
the O
superfluous O
draught O

had O
swallowed O

     | O
after O
bestowing O
patient O

assiduous O
friction O
on O
his O
breast O

limbs O

they O
had O
the O
great O

     | O
satisfaction O
of O
seeing O
the O
chest O
heave O
with O
returning O
respiration O

all O
other O
symptoms O
of O

     | O
revivification O
follow O
in O
their O
proper O
order O

till O
the O
eyes O
of O
Michael B-PERSON
were O
once O
more O
widely O
|
     | O
opened O
, O
and O
fixed O
with O
preplexity O
, O
and O
something O
like O
terror O
, O
on O
the O
faces O
which O
were O
bending O

     | O
over O
him O

" O

ejaculated O
the O
old O
man O
earnestly O

" O
he O

safe O
now O

from O
drowning O

     | O
I O
have O
not O
got O
that O
to O

he O
is O
n't O
in O
a O
trim O
to O
be O
left O

my O
lads O

He O
would O
have O

     | O
been O
as O
well O
in O
the O
river O
, O
perhaps O
, O
as O
out O

it O
, O
if O
we O
do O
no O
more O
for O
him O

" O

Then O
causing O
Michael B-PERSON
to O
sit O
, O
and O
examining O
his O
features O
, O
with O
a O
glance O
of O
very O
friendly O

     | O
curiosity O

he O
said O

" O
You O
do O

look O

you O

desperate O
action O

" O

  | O
The O
effort O
which O
the O
poor O
boy O
made O
to O
answer O
was O
ineffectual O

he O
only O
shook O
his O
head O

" O

many O
grassy O

permitting O

pleasure O

He O
literally O
hugged O
himself O

blessed O
the O

the O
firm O

healthy O

For O
many B-TIME

he O
stood O
still O

enjoy O
this O

as O
his O

perused O

of O
the O

     | O
dusky O

recalled O
the O

within O

his O

     | O

with O
gratitude O

the O

blessed O
God O
aloud O

But O
as O

almost O
repented O
of O
his O
selfish O
joy O
, O
and O
blamed O

     | O
the O
ecstasy O
that O
for O
a O
while O
had O
made O
him O
so O
utterly O
forget O
that O
thousands B-CARDINAL
were O
imprisoned O

     | O
still O

though O
he O
was O
free O

On O

and O
on O

walked O
with O
his O
eyes O
immovably O
fixed O
upon O
the O
hideous O
fabric O
till O
, O
sooner O
than O

     | O
he O
expected O
it O
, O
he O
stood O
before O
the O
gates O

He O
had O
connived O
no O
previous O
plan O
by O
which O
to O
enter O

     | O
it O
, O
and O
knew O
that O
without O
some O
specific O
business O
, O
real O
or O
feigned O
, O
it O
would O
be O
impossible O
  O
but O

     | O
while O
he O
stood O
weighing O
the O
danger O
of O
possible O
discovery O
against O
his O
very O
strong O
inclination O
to O

see O
what O
alteration O
time O
had O
made O
in O

whether O
he O
should O
recognise O
any O
among O

     | O
them O
— O
and O
whether O
his O
old O
tyrant O
, O
Parsons B-PERSON
, O
was O
still O
their O
chief O

opened O

and O
one B-CARDINAL

the O
engine O

men O
, O
a O
grizzly O
fellow O
, O
whom O
he O
well O
remembered O
when O
his O
sable O
hair O
was O
somewhat O
|
     | O
less O
silvered O
, O
came O
forth O
. O
| 
   | O
He O
gave O
Michael B-PERSON
a O
look O
, O
that O
very O
plainly O
said O
, O
" O
What O
do O

you O
|  | O
and O
in O
truth O
, O
his O
neat O
appearance O
, O
unstained O
skin O
, O
and O
free O
unshrinking O
eye O
, O
very O
|
     | O
naturally O
suggested O
the O
idea O
that O
he O
could O
have O
no O
business O
there O
. O
|  
  | O
" O
Is O
Mr. O
Parsons B-PERSON
within O
? O
" O
said O
Michael B-PERSON
boldly I-PERSON
, O
and O
daring O
the O
inquiry O
as O
much O
because O
he O
knew O
|
     | O
not O
what O
to O
say O
, O
as O
from O
any O
deliberate O
resolution O
to O
do O
so O
. O

  | O
" O
Yes O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
man O
  O
" O
he O
is O
about O
the O
place O
somewhere O
, O
I O
seed O
him O
not O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
ten I-CARDINAL
|
     | O
minutes O
ago O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Michael B-PERSON
nodded O
his O
head O
, O
and O
walked O
through O
the O
gate O
into O
the O
court O
, O
across O
which O
he O
had O
|
     | O
passed O
in O
trembling O
a O
thousand O
times O
. O
Nor O
was O
he O
now O
quite O
free O
from O
a O
slight O
feeling O
of O
alarm O
|
     | O
at O
the O
idea O
of O
meeting O
the O
sharp O
eyes O
of O
his O
former O
terrible O
taskmaster O
, O
and O
felt O
much O
inclined O
|
     | O
to O
blame O
himself O
for O
the O
curious O
temerity O
which O
had O
brought O
him O
so O
nearly O
within O
his O
gripe O
. O
But O
|
     | O
it O
was O
too O
late O
to O
retreat O
, O
for O
at O
the O
distance O
of O
a B-QUANTITY
dozen I-QUANTITY
yards I-QUANTITY
he O
saw O
Parsons O
before O
him O
, O
|
     | O
coming O
forth O
from O
the O
building O
into O
the O
court O
. O
On O
seeing O
the O
stranger O
he O
immediately O
approached O
|
     | O
him O
  O
Michael B-PERSON
touched O
his O
hat O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
What O
may O
your O
business O
here O
be O
, O
young O
man O
? O
" O
said O
Parsons O
eyeing O
him O
from O
top O
to O
toe O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
called O
in O
, O
sir O
, O
to O
inquire O
whether O
you O
happened O
to O
want O
a O
spinner O

what O
the O
wages O
may O

     | O
be O

said O
Michael B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Is O
it O
for O
yourself O
? O
" O
demanded O
Parsons O
, O
knitting O
his O
brows O
, O
and O
looking O
at O
him O
with O
a O
sort O
of O
|
     | O
incredulous O
sneer O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Why O
, O
no O
sir O
, O
it O
is O
for O
a O
kinsman O
who O
happens O
to O
be O
out O
of O

" O
replied O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
|
     | O
colouring O
from O
the O
unusual O
consciousness O
of O
deceit O
, O
and O
from O
the O
same O
cause O
casting O
his O
eyes O

     | O
upon O
the O
ground O
, O
thereby O
displaying O
the O
remarkable O
length O
of O
his O
black O
eyelashes O
, O
and O
giving O
to O

     | O
his O
whole O
countenance O
a O
look O
much O
more O
resembling O
that O
of O
former O
days O
, O
than O
he O
had O
worn O
when O
he O
|
     | O
first B-ORDINAL
entered O
. O
| 
  | O
Parsons O
looked O
at O
him O
with O
a O
sort O
of O
vague O
idea O
that O
he O
had O
seen O
him O
before O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Where O
do O
you O
come O
from O
? O
" O
said O
he O
. O

  | O
" O
From O
Westmorland B-PERSON

" O

" O
Robert B-PERSON
Thornton I-PERSON
, O
sir O

" O
replied O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
blushing O
again O
, O
as O
he O
thus O
unceremoniously O
borrowed O
|
     | O
the O
appellation O
of O
his O
worthy O
master O
. O

" O

" O

I O

said O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
from O
mere O
want O
of O
skill O

hardihood B-PERSON
in O

     | O
the O
art O

you O

" O

  | O
Michael B-PERSON
by O
no O
means O
unwillingly O
obeyed O
this O
dismissal O
, O
and O
walked O
away O
, O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
half I-CARDINAL

     | O
ashamed O
of O
his O
achievement O

addressed O

the O
overlooker O

to O
another O

had O
brought O

I O
was O

take O
a O

Off O
started O
the O

right O
good O

will O

her O
own O
reasons O
for O
wishing O
to O
do O
the O

     | O
errand O
, O

well O

Mr. O

by O
no O

over O

rated O
her O
running O

had O
she O
been O
less O

she O
would O

have O
failed O
in O
her O

briskly O
, O

without O
any O

     | O
longer O
in O
the O

of O

by O
no O

He O
had O
just O
turned O
the O
corner O
of O
a O
hedge O
when O
the O
girl O
overtook O
him O
, O
so O
that O
their O
colloquy O

     | O
did O
not O
take O
place O
within O

of O
the O

  | O
Michael B-PERSON
heard O
the O
fair O
Kitty B-PERSON

approach O
, O

turned O
to O
see O
who O
it O
was O
that O
thus O
came O

     | O
galloping O

panting O
after O
him O

" O
Do O
you O

holding O
out O

If O
I O

He O
thinks O

All O

ended O

him O

Yet O
did O
his O
heart O
throb O

his O
eye O
kindle O
as O
he O
perused O

| 
  | O
Very O
powerful O
was O
the O
male O

simple O
eloquence O
with O
which O
many O
of O
these O
unpretending O

     | O
compositions O
appealed O
to O
the O
paternal O
feelings O

those O

addressed O
  O

such O

true O

found O
among O

the O

remembered O
agonies O
of O
his O
boyhood O
, O
that O

     | O
Michael B-PERSON
was O
fain O
to O
put O
his O

his O
face O
to O
conceal O
the O
emotions O
they O

     | O
produced O
. O
| 
  | O
He O
had O
sat O
in O
this O
situation O
for O
some B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
, O
revolving O
both O
his O
former O
sufferings O

the O

     | O
blessedness O
of O
his O
present O
release O
from O
them O
, O
when O
a O
man O
, O
who O
had O
been O
quietly O
sitting O
writing O

     | O
at O
a O
distant O
window O
, O
but O
had O
nevertheless O
found O
leisure O
to O
watch O
Michael B-PERSON
's O
countenance O
as O
he O
|
     | O
proceeded O
with O
his O
examination O
of O
the O

, O
rose O
from O
his O
place O
, O
and O
gently O
approaching O

     | O
him O
said O
, O
in O
deep O
, O
yet O
very O
gentle O
voice O
, O
" O
You O
seem O
moved O
by O
the O
perusal O

these O

my O

     | O
good O
friend O

Is O
it O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
you O
have O
met O
with O
them O
? O
" O

  | O
" O
Yes O
, O
indeed O
, O
sir O

it O
is O

" O
replied O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
starting O
from O
his O
revery O
. O

  | O
" O
Then O
I O
presume O
you O
are O
a O
stranger O
in O
this O
part O
of O
the O
country O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Why O
, O
yes O
, O
sir O
  O
the O
master O
I O
serve O
is O
a O
Westmorland B-ORG

I O
am O
only O

this O
way O

     | O
upon O
a O
holiday O
trip O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Then O
maybe O
you O
do O
n't O
care O
enough O
for O
the O
poor O
factory O
operatives O
to O
join O
their O
meeting O

     | O
put O
your O

" O
If O
caring O
for O
them O
could O
do O
them O
any O
good O
, O
master O

replied O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
warmly O
, O
" O
they O
would O
be O

     | O
in O
no O
want O
of O
help O

as O
long O
as O
I O
was O
near O
them O

But O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
the O
name O
of O
a O
poor O

     | O
servant O
- O
boy O
like O
me O

could O
do O
them O
either O
honour O

" O

" O
Then O
what O
sort O
of O
names O
, O
my O
good O
lad O
, O
do O
you O
suppose O
will O
support O
this O
petition O

Do O
you O
|
     | O
think O
the O
great O
mill O
- O
owners O
will O
sign O
it O
? O
— O
Do O
you O
think O
such O
men O

Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling I-PERSON
for O

you O

heard O

down O
at O
Ashleigh B-PERSON

, O
do O
you O
think O
it O
will O
be O

     | O
such O
as O
he O
, O
whose O
first B-ORDINAL
object O
in O

is O
to O
get O
as B-TIME
many I-TIME
hours I-TIME

out O
of O
the O
little O

work O
for O
him O

that O
will O
sign O
the B-TIME
ten I-TIME

" O

" O
Not O

that O

either O
to O
hurt O
himself O

better O
the O
children O

" O
said O

     | O
Michael B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
" O
True O
enough O
, O
" O
replied O
his O
new O
acquaintance O
, O
" O

not O
only O

that O
true O

he O

Heaven O

     | O
forbid O
they O
should O
succeed O
, O
young O

for O
if O
they O
do O

the O
best O
hope O
of O
many O
thousand O

     | O
suffering O

most O

fervently O

" O
When O
is O
this O

he O
added O
, O
turning O
his O

again O

still O

feelings O
of O
distrust O
or O
alarm O
, O
therefore O
, O
arose O
to O
check O
the O
pleasurable O
excitement O
|
     | O
which O
this O
expedition O
was O
calculated O
to O
inspire O
  O
and O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
with O
his O
stout O
staff O
over O
his O

     | O
shoulder O
, O
and O
the O
cotton O
handkerchief O
, O
containing O
a O
change O
of O
linen O
, O
suspended O
from O
it O
, O
set O
out O
|
     | O
with O
a O
light O
heart O
and O
active O
step O
upon O
a O
walk O
in O
which O
he O
soon O
found O
himself O
joined O
by O
many B-CARDINAL

     | I-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
companions O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
assurance O
given O
him O
by O
his O
unknown O
acquaintance O
, O
that O
he O
should O
see O
a O
wonderful O
and O
|
     | O
spirit O
- O
stirring O
spectacle O
, O
was O
fully O
verified O
. O
The O
very O
sight O
of O
the O
road O
along O
which O
he O
|
     | O
travelled O
, O
which O
looked O
like O
a O
dark O
and O
mighty O
current O
moving O
irresistibly O
along O
, O
while O
|
     | O
tributary O
streams O
flowed O
into O
it O
on O
all O
sides O
, O
so O
thick O
and O
serried O
was O
the O
mass O
that O
moved O
|
     | O
along O
it O
, O
was O
of O
itself O
well O
worth O
the O
toil O
it O
cost O
him O
, O
to O
behold O
its O
peaceful O
tumult O
. O
From O
|
     | O
time O
to O
time O
Michael B-PERSON
indulged O
in O
a O
little O
questioning O
of O
the O
various O
individuals O
beside O
whom O
he O
|
     | O
found O
himself O
  O
but O
for O
the O
most O
part O
the O
men O
were O
too O
intent O
upon O
the O
object O
of O
their O
|
     | O
expedition O
, O
to O
converse O
idly O
respecting O
it O
— O
and O
by O
degrees O
our O
hero O
grew O
as O
silent O
as O
the O
|
     | O
rest O
, O
and O
trudged O
on O
without O
any O
other O
communion O
than O
that O
of O
his O
own O
thoughts O
. O
| 
  | O
It O
was O
at O
about B-QUANTITY
twenty I-QUANTITY
miles I-QUANTITY
distance O
from O
York B-GPE
, O
when O
the O
multitude O
were O
on O
their O
return O
, O
|
     | O
that O
a O
circumstance O
occurred O
, O
which O
, O
being O
of O
considerable O
importance O
to O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
must O
be O
|
     | O
detailed O
somewhat O
at O
length O
. O
He O
had O
entered O
an O
inn O
by O
the O
road O
- O
side O
, O
which O
, O
being O
one O
of O
the O
|
     | O
largest O
post O
- O
houses O
on O
the O
north O
road O
, O
had O
an O
air O
of O
pretension O
and O
costliness O
about O
it O
, O
that O
|
     | O
caused O
the O
great O
majority O
of O
the O
host O
to O
walk O
on O
, O
without O
venturing O
to O
approach O
precincts O
so O
|
     | O
dangerous O
. O
| 
  | O
But O
Michael B-PERSON
was O
much O
exhausted O
, O
and O
having O
already O
discovered O
, O
when O
passing O
before O
the O
|
     | O
humbler O
houses O
of O
public O
entertainment O
, O
that O
no O
rest O
could O
be O
hoped O
from O
entering O
them O
, O
every O
|
     | O
inch O
of O
space O
being O
occupied O
, O
he O
deemed O
it O
wisest O
to O
disburse O
a O
splendid O
shilling O
, O
rather O
than O
|
     | O
fag O
on O
till O
he O
had O
no O
strength O
to O
go O
further O
. O
| 
   | O
were O
not O
many O
of O
his O
fellow O
- O
travellers O
either O
rich O
or O
extravagant O
enough O
to O
share O
|
     | O
these O
splendid O
quarters O
with O
him O
, O
there O
were O
, O
nevertheless O
, O
three B-CARDINAL
or O
four B-CARDINAL
men O
taking O
|
     | O
refreshment O
in O
the O
apartment O
. O
One B-CARDINAL
of O
these O
, O
an O
elderly O
respectable O
- O
looking O
personage O
, O
who O
had O
, O
|
     | O
as O
it O
seemed O
, O
exclusive O
possession O
of O
a O
snug O
little O
round O
- O
table O
in O
a O
corner O
, O
made O
a O
sign O
to O
|
     | O
Michael B-PERSON
to O
share O
it O
with O
him O
. O
This O
was O
gratefully O
accepted O
, O
the O
loaf O
and O
cheese O
were O
already O
|
     | O
there O
, O
and O
the O
foaming O
tankard O
quickly O
followed O
. O
|  
  | O
" O
I O
marked O
you O
at O
the O
meeting O

" O
said O
his O
sociable O
companion O
. O
" O
It O
did O
my O

good O

see O
a O

having O
nothing O

' O
Tis O
a O
pity O

a O
sin O
too O
, O
that O
so O
many O

     | O
Englishmen B-LANGUAGE
stand O
idly O
by O
, O
when O
such O
a O
business O
as O
this O
is O
afoot O

just O
as O
if O
they O
had O
nothing O
to O

     | O
do O
with O
it O

But O
they O
are O
one O

all O
mistaken O

that O
they O
may O
chance O

find O
out O

too O

one B-CARDINAL

" O

" O
You O
give O
me O
credit O

more O

, O
" O
replied O
Michael B-PERSON
  O
" O
that O
is O
, O
if O
you O

     | O
think O
my O
heart O
was O
enough O
with O
the O
poor O
factory O

folks O
to O
make O
me O
take O
a O
long O
roundabout O
to O
sign O

with O
them O

without O

right O

thinking O
that O
I O

not O
one O

I O

it O

for O
the O
keeping O
that O

enough O

" O
You O

said O
the O

in O
an O
accent O
of O
surprise O
  O
" O
I O
should O
never O

you O

loved O
her O

to O
my O

" O
Not O

the O

though O
they O
do O

that O

But O
I O
do O
well O
remember O
something O
particular O
about O
Miss B-PERSON

     | O
Martha B-PERSON
that O
you O
talk O
of O
, O
a O
matter O
of O
seven B-DATE
years I-DATE

  O
and O
if O
she O
was O
good O
to O
you O
, O
it O
was O
more O

     | O
than O
she O
was O
to O
every O
body O
, O
for O
it O
was O
all O
along O
of O
a O
cruel O
piece O
of O
treachery O
of O
hers O
, O
that O
I O

     | O
lost O
the O
best O
mistress O
that O
ever O
man O
had O
. O
I O
dare O
say O
, O
if O
you O
come O
from O
Ashleigh B-PERSON
, O
you O
must O
know O
|
     | O
the O
name O
of O
Miss B-PERSON
Brotherton I-PERSON
, O
though O
it O
's O
long O

she O
left O

I O
was O
her O
coachman O

     | O
if O
it O
had O
not O
been O
for O
Miss O
Martha B-PERSON
Dowling I-PERSON

I O
believe O
I O
might O
have O
been O
so O
still O
. O
" O

" O
I O
was O

just O
turned O
ten B-DATE

at O
the O
time O
I O
knew O
Miss O

returned O
Michael B-PERSON
  O
" O
but O
|
     | O
I O
should O
n't O
have O
thought O
she O
could O

" O

" O
She O

knew O
the O
whole O

from O
first B-ORDINAL

and O
a O
queer O

     | O
story O
it O
was O
too O
, O
when O
one O
thinks O
of O
the O

it O
  O

was O
neither O
more O

     | O
sending O

away O
out O

Michael B-PERSON
  O
" O
except O
that O
she O
was O
one O
of O
the O
fine O
folks O

I O
have O
seen O

     | O
at O
Dowling B-FAC
Lodge I-FAC

but O
I O
should O
like O
to O
hear O
the O
story O
, O
because O
of O
Miss O
Martha B-PERSON
. O
" O
|  
  | O
" O
Why O
the O
short O
and O
the O
long O
of O
it O
was O
, O
that O
there O
was O
a O
poor O
widow O
called O
Armstrong B-PERSON
— O
" O
| 
  | O
Michael B-PERSON
started O
so O
violently O
, O
that O
his O
companion O
stopped O
. O

" O
Did O
you O
happen O
to O
know O
her O

my O
lad O

he O
added O
, O
after O
a O
pause O

" O
Yes O
, O
sir O
, O
I O
remember O
her O
very O
well O

but O
please O
to O
go O
on O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Well O
then O
, O
this O
widow O
Armstrong B-PERSON
had O
two B-CARDINAL
sons O
, O
and O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
was O
had O
up O
to O
the O
great O
house O
, O

     | O
Dowling B-PERSON
Lodge I-PERSON
, O
I O
mean O
, O
for O
some O
nonsensical O
reason O
or O
other O
  O
and O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
pretended O
to O
make O
|
     | O
the O
greatest O
fuss O
in O
the O
world O
about O
him O
, O
and O
the O
whole O
country O
was O
talking O
about O
it O

But O
for O
|
     | O
some O
offence O
of O
the O
poor O
boy O
's O
, O
I O
never O
rightly O
heard O
what O
, O
the O
old O
sinner O
determined O
upon O

     | O
sending O
him O
' O
prentice O
to O
the O
most O
infernal O
place O
, O
by O
all O
account O
, O
that O
the O
earth O
has O
got O
to O
be O
|
     | O
ashamed O
of O
. O
And O
how O
do O
you O
think O
the O
poor O
widow O
was O
coaxed O
over O
to O
sign O
the O
indentures O
? O
Why O
by O

     | O
your O
friend O
, O
Miss O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
and O
no O
one O
else O
, O
and O
that O
I O
know O
upon O
the O
best O
authority O
. O
Well O
, O
' O
tis O
|
     | O
a O
long O
story O
, O
the O
ins O
and O
outs O
of O
it O
, O
and O
I O
ca O
n't O
say O
that O
I O
ever O
rightly O
understood O
the O
whole O
, O
|
     | O
but O
this O
I O
know O
to O
be O
fact O
: O
that O
our O
young O
mistress O
took O
the O
whole O
thing O
so O
much O
to O
heart O
, O
that O
|
     | O
she O
actually O
set O
out O
to O
look O
after O
the O
boy O
  O
but O
when O
she O
got O
to O
the O
murderous O
place O
the O
poor O
|
     | O
little O
fellow O
was O
dead O
! O
And O
what O
did O
she O
do O
then O
, O
dear O
, O
tender O
- O
hearted O
lady O
! O
but O
bring O
back O
a O
|
     | O
pretty O
little O
girl O
instead O
of O
him O
, O
because O
, O
as O
we O
all O
guessed O
, O
she O
was O
determined O
to O
save O
|
     | O
somebody O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
The O
emotion O
of O
Michael B-PERSON
Armstrong I-PERSON
on O
hearing O
this O
, O
was O
so O
entirely O
beyond O
his O
power O
to O
|
     | O
conquer O
, O
that O
he O
lost O
all O
capability O
of O
utterance O
, O
and O
instead O
of O
asking O
the O
name O
of O
the O
little O
|
     | O
girl O
— O
an O
inquiry O
which O
he O
in O
vain O
strove O
to O
make O
— O
he O
sat O
pale O
and O
gasping O
, O
with O
his O
eyes O
|
     | O
fixed O
on O
the O
speaker O
, O
and O
every O
limb O
trembling O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
The O
Lord O
have O
mercy O
on O
us O
! O
what O
is O
the O
matter O
with O
you O

" O

my O
tale O
as O

so O
? O

is O
it O

murmured O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
making O
a O
strong O
effort O
to O

     | O
articulate O
. O

" O
' O

the O
story O

then O

you O
knowed O
the O
poor O
Armstrongs B-PERSON

beyond O
all O
doubt O

said O
the O

     | O
kind O

hearted O
coachman O

" O
Well O
then O
, O
you O
shall O
hear O
the O
end O
of O
it O
. O
When O
my O
mistress O
brought O
back O
|
     | O
the O
news O
of O
the O
little O
fellow O
's O
death O
, O
his O
poor O
mother O
, O
who O
was O
but O
a O
sickly O
, O
cripply B-PERSON
sort O
of O
|
     | O
body O
, O
just O
broke O
her O
heart O
and O
died O
  O
whereupon O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
took O
home O
the O
other O
boy O
, O
put O
him O
|
     | O
to O
school O
to O
my O
wife O
, O
and O
then O
took O
to O
teaching O
him O
herself O
, O
and O
treated O
him O
for O
all O
the O
world O

     | O
as O
if O
he O
had O
been O
her O
own O
brother O
  O
and O
then O
she O
began O
to O
fancy O
that O
he O
wanted O
a O
doctor O
— O
" O

  | O
" O
And O
then O
, O
" O
groaned O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
suddenly O
interrupting O
him O

— O

he O
died O

   | O
one O
may O
say O
. O
And O
when O
was O
it O
he O
died O

It O
's O
curious O
that O

never O

     | O
heard O
of O
it O

" O

" O
Heard O
of O
it O

" O
said O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
while O
a O
sort O
of O
wild O
uncertainty O
took O
possession O
of O
his O
mind O
, O
|
     | O
that O
gave O
him O
the O
feeling O
of O
one O
whose O
reason O
threatened O
to O
leave O
him O
. O
" O
Heard O
it O

Why O
did O
you O

     | O
want O

hear O
it O

Could O
you O
not O
see O
it O

know O
it O

if O
he O

living O

you O

" O

" O
For O
certain O
I O
could O
, O
if O
he O
had O
died O
while O
Miss B-PERSON
Brotherton I-PERSON
remained O
at O
the O
park O
  O
but O
that O
he O

     | O
did O
not O
, O
for O
I O
drove O
him O
off O
the O
first B-ORDINAL

alive O

well O
, O

beautiful O

he O
always O
did O

what O
might O

happened O
to O
him O
afterwards O

is O
of O
course O
more O
than O
I O
can O
say O
  O
for O

when O
the O

sold O

all O

it O
would O

closing O

remained O
so O
long O

motionless O
, O
that O
his O
good O

alarmed O

laying O
his O
hand O
upon O
the O
poor O

     | O
lad O

arm O

shook O
him O
gently O

sheet O

natural O
enough O

too O

my O
notion O
that O

spread O
upon O

     | O
it O

But O
he O
quaffed O
a O
long O
and O
refreshing O
draught O
from O
a O
pitcher O
of O
cold O
water O
, O
and O
putting O

the O
worthy O
coachman O

a O

sallied O
forth O

the O

     | O
agitating O
consciousness O

on O

hung O
all O
his O

earthly O

  | O
His O
new O
friend O
shook O
his O
head O
as O
he O
felt O
his O
feverish O
hand O
, O
and O
marked O
his O
heightened O
colour O

his O
eager O

you O
at O

And O
here O
, O
Michael B-PERSON

, O
are O
three B-CARDINAL
sovereigns O
, O
that O
I O
give O
you O
to O
keep O
for O
two B-CARDINAL
reasons O
. O
One B-CARDINAL
is O
, O
that O
you O
may O
|
     | O
use O
them O
in O
case O
you O
have O
need O
. O
The O
other O
, O
that O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
want O
them O
, O
I O
shall O
be O
sure O
to O
see O
|
     | O
you O
, O
when O
you O
bring O
them O
back O
, O
and O
that O
you O
will O
do O
, O
or O
I O
'll O
never O
trust O
a O
lad O
's O
face O
more O
  O
and O
|
     | O
now O
good O
bye O
. O
It O
is O
but O
a O
wildish O
sort O
of O
boy O
's O
trick O
though O
, O
setting O
off O
this O
way O
at O
night B-TIME
, O
|
     | O
when O
you O
ought O
to O
be O
in O
bed O
. O
" O
|  
  | O
" O
The O
air O
and O
the O
walk O
will O
do O
me O
more O
good O
than O
all O
the O
beds O
in O
the O
world O
! O
" O
replied O
Michael B-PERSON
. O
|
     | O
" O
God O
bless O
you O
, O
sir O

See O
me O
you O
shall O
, O
if O
I O
continue O
to O
live O
  O
" O
and O
so O
saying O
, O
he O
strode O
forth O
|
     | O
into O
the O
night O
, O
with O
a O
longing O
for O
greater O
space O
to O
breathe O
in O
, O
than O
could O
be O
found O
in O
the O
|
     | O
kitchen O
of O
the O
Royal B-ORG
- O
oak O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
boy O
was O
right O
as O
to O
the O
effect O
which O
this O
bodily O
exertion O
would O
produce O
upon O
him O
. O
The O
|
     | O
very O
darkness O
calmed O
him O
  O
he O
took O
his O
hat O
off O
that O
the O
cool O
air O
might O
bathe O
his O
temples O
with O
|
     | O
its O
dewy O
breath O
  O
and O
though O
his O
pace O
was O
rapid O
, O
and O
scarcely O
relaxed O
for O
a O
moment O
during O
many O
|
     | O
miles O
, O
the O
action O
of O
his O
pulse O
became O
more O
healthy O
, O
and O
the O
aching O
of O
his O
throbbing O
temples O
|
     | O
passed O
away O
. O
| 
  | O
All O
he O
now O
seemed O
to O
fear O
was O
that O
his O
imagination O
should O
cheat O
him O
into O
the O
persuasion O
that O
|
     | O
all O
he O
wished O
was O
true O
. O

her O
identity O

Miss O

        | O
protégée O
|  | O
he O
could O
hardly O
doubt O
, O
when O
he O
remembered O
the O
history O
of O
her O
departure O
from O

     | O
the B-LOC
Deep I-LOC
Valley I-LOC
) O
— O
these O
names O
seemed O
to O
ring O
in O
his O
ears O
, O
and O
to O
be O
inscribed O
in O
starlight O
on O
|
     | O
the O
heavens O
as O
he O
raised O
his O
eyes O
towards O
them O
. O
And O
thus O
the O
sixteen B-QUANTITY
miles I-QUANTITY
were O
traversed O
|
     | O
before O
he O
had O
half B-CARDINAL
chewed O
the O
cud O
of O
all O
the O
sweet O
thoughts O
that O
thronged O
upon O
his O
fancy O
. O
When O
|
     | O
he O
reached O
Fairly O
, O
it O
was O
still O
much O
too O
early O
to O
find O
any O
one O
stirring O
, O
so O
Michael B-PERSON

     | O
unceremoniously O
walked O

a O

up O

and O
despite O

     | O
both O
hopes O

fell O

AN B-ORG
IMPORTANT I-ORG
INTERVIEW I-ORG
— O
DOUBTS O
AND O
FEARS O
. O
| 
   | O
than O
he O
felt O
conscious O
of O
being O
near O
the O
most O
important O
moment O
of O
his O
life O
. O
Again O
|
     | O
he O
closed O
his O
eyes O
, O
but O
not O
to O
sleep O
, O
and O
fervently O
prayed O
that O
whatever O
might O
be O
the O
tidings O
|
     | O
which O
awaited O
him O
, O
he O
might O
have O
strength O
to O
receive O
and O
bear O
them O
as O
he O
ought O
. O
Then O
, O
springing O
|
     | O
from O
his O
resting O
- O
place O
upon O
the O
ground O
, O
he O
inquired O
of O
a O
lad O
near O
him O
the O
way O
to O
Mr. O
Bell B-PERSON
's O
, O
|
     | O
and O
set O
off O
to O
follow O
the O
directions O
he O
received O
with O
no O
greater O
delay O
than O
was O
necessary O
for O
a O
|
     | O
short O
halt O
beside O
a O
little O
streamlet O
on O
the O
way O
, O
which O
offered O
a O
welcome O
opportunity O
of O
washing O
|
     | O
his O
face O
and O
hands O
before O
he O
petitioned O
for O
admission O
to O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
good O
clergyman O
, O
to O
|
     | O
whose O
words O
he O
looked O
forward O
with O
an O
intensity O
of O
interest O
which O
almost O
amounted O
to O
agony O
. O
|  
  | O
Though O
it O
was O
still O
early O
, O
Mr. O
Bell B-PERSON
was O
already O
in O
his O
garden O
, O
and O
when O
the O
gate O
opened O
, O
it O
|
     | O
was O
himself O
who O
turned O
towards O
it O
to O
learn O
the O
errand O
of O
the O
young O
stranger O
. O
Michael B-PERSON
felt O
at O
|
     | O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
glance O
that O
the O
gentleman O
who O
stood O
before O
him O
was O
the O
person O
from O
whom O
he O
was O
to O
|
     | O
learn O
whether O
the O
brother O
he O
had O
so O
long O
mourned O
as O
dead O
was O
still O
alive O
, O
and O
he O
trembled O
so O
|
     | O
violently O
from O
head O
to O
foot O
that O
he O
could O
not O
articulate O
a O
word O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
What O
ails O
you O
, O
my O
lad O
? O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Bell B-PERSON
, O
gently O
laying O
a O
hand O
upon O
his O
shoulder O
, O
and O
looking O
|
     | O
earnestly O
in O
his O
face O
. O
" O
You O
have O
not O
the O
look O
of O
one O
who O
has O
done O
mischief O
, O
or O
else O
I O
could O
|
     | O
fancy O
that O
you O
had O
some O
terrible O
tale O
to O
tell O
. O
Come O
into O
the O
house O
and O
sit O
down O
, O
my O
boy O
, O
for O
it O
|
     | O
is O
very O
clear O
you O
are O
not O
quite O
able O
to O
stand O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
still O
silent O
, O
followed O
his O
considerate O
host O
into O
the O
house O
, O
and O
thankfully O
received O
|
     | O
from O
his O
hands O
a O
glass O
of O
water O
, O
which O
did O
him O
good O
service O
, O
for O
in O
a O
minute O
or O
two B-CARDINAL
he O
was O
able O
|
     | O
to O
say O
, O
" O
I O
want O
you O
to O
tell O
me O

may O
God O

But O
notwithstanding O
Michael B-PERSON
's O
torturing O
eagerness O
to O
hear O
the O
answer O
, O
he O
put O
his O
hand O

     | O
before O
his O
eyes O

because O
he O
had O
not O

it O

Michael B-PERSON
sunk O
from O

lifting O
his O
clasped O

towards O
Heaven O

Full O
as O
his O
heart O
was O
, O
and O
eagerly O
as O
he O
longed O
for O
the O
conversation O
in O
which O
he O
had O
so O
much O

to O

Michael B-PERSON
gratefully O
submitted O
to O
this O
arrangement O

     | O
received O
from O
the O
hands O

the O

interested O
Mrs. O
Bell B-PERSON
herself O
the O
refreshment O
he O
so O
|
     | O
greatly O
needed O
, O
he O
felt O
his O
young O
strength O
return O
, O
and O
if O
he O
trembled O
as O
he O
turned O
his O
eyes O
|
     | O
towards O
his O
kind O
host O
, O
with O
a O
look O
that O
seemed O
to O
say O
, O
" O
Now O
, O
sir O
, O
I O
can O
talk O
to O
you O
, O
" O
it O
was O
|
     | O
from O
eagerness O
, O
not O
weakness O
. O
| 
  | O
Mr. O
Bell B-PERSON
understood O
the O
appeal O
, O
and O
well O
inclined O
to O
answer O
it O
, O
said O
, O
" O

told O
you O

my O

the O
sight O
that O
I O
see O
now O
to O
make O
him O

perfectly O
happy O

not O

you O
any O
more O

     | O
my O
curiosity O

your O

in O

did O
it O
happen O

away O

" O

  | O
Michael B-PERSON
Armstrong I-PERSON
told O
his O
own O
story O
more O
succinctly O
than O
I O
have O
been O
able O
to O
do O
it O
, O
and O

     | O
probably O
much O
better O
too O

for O

beguiled O
Mrs. O
Bell B-PERSON
of O
many O
tears O
as O
she O
listened O
to O
him O
  O
and O
|
     | O
bare O
as O
the O
sad O
narrative O
was O
of O
events O
, O
her O
husband O
also O
hung O
upon O
every O
word O
of O
it O
, O
as O
if O
, O

     | O
contrary O
to O
the O
theory O
which O
seemed O
to O
be O
pretty O
generally O
established O
in O
his O
neighbourhood O
, O
he O
|
     | O
thought O
the O
feelings O
and O
the O
sufferings O
of O
a O
factory O
- O
child O
might O
be O
capable O
of O
exciting O

     | O

When O
the O
history O
had O
reached O
its O
conclusion O
, O
and O
Michael B-PERSON
had O
fairly O
brought O
himself O
into O
Mr. O

     | O
Bell B-ORG
's O
breakfast O
- O
parlour O
, O
he O
paused O
, O
and O
with O
a O
very O
eloquent O
look O
of O
entreaty O
said O
, O
" O
Now O
, O
sir O
, O

     | O
may O
I O

I O
go O
any O
further O

what O
sort O
of O
a O
boy O
was O
your O
brother O
Edward B-PERSON

you O
saw O
him O

last O

" O

  | O
" O
Oh O
, O
sir O
! O
he O
was O
the O
dearest O
, O
kindest O
fellow O
that O
ever O
lived O
! O
" O
replied O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
his O
fine O
eyes O

     | O
beaming O
with O
tenderness O
and O
well O
- O
remembered O
love O

" O
But O
what O
sort O
of O
a O
boy O
was O
he O
to O
look O
at O
? O
" O
demanded O
the O
clergyman O
. O
| 
  | O
Michael B-PERSON
closed O
his O
eyes O
as O
if O
the O
better O
to O
contemplate O
the O
inward O
picture O
engraven O
on O
his O
|
     | O
memory O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
His O
face O
was O
a O
sweet O
face O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
" O
but O
his O
dear O
limbs O
were O
crippled O
. O
He O
was O
a O
slighter O
|
     | O
boy O
than O
me O
, O
and O
could O
not O
stand O
the O
labour O
of O
the O
mill O
  O
and O
I O
fear O
— O
I O
fear O
, O
" O
he O
added O
, O
|
     | O
shuddering O
, O
" O
that O
my O
poor O
Edward B-PERSON
must O
live O
and O
die O
a O
cripple O
. O
" O

  | O
" O
What O
is O
your O
opinion O
about O
that O
, O
my O
dear O
? O

said O
Mr. O
Bell B-PERSON
, O
turning O
to O
his O
laughing O
wife O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Why O
, O
I O
am O
inclined O
to O
think O
that O
Michael B-PERSON
will O
have O
some O
difficulty O
in O
identifying O
his O
|
     | O
brother O
when O
he O
gets O
to O
him O
, O
" O
she O
replied O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Instead O
of O
being O
a O
cripple O
, O
" O
resumed O
Mr. O
Bell B-PERSON
, O
" O
I O
suspect O
that O
your O
brother O
is O
a O
handsomer O
|
     | O
fellow O
than O
you O
are O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
. O
Every O
thing O
promised O
well O
for O
it O
when O
he O
took O
leave O
of O
us O
, O
and O
|
     | O
since O
then O
my O
wife O
has O
had O
letters O
from O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
, O
which O
do O
not O
speak O
of O
any O
falling O
off O

in O
his O
improvement O

" O

  | O
" O
Nay O
, O
" O
said O
the O
lady O
, O
" O
I O
have O
had O
more O
than O
letters O

it O

I O
show O
him O
Miss O

" O
Most O

my O

will O
save O
me O

Miss O

Michael B-PERSON

my O
words O

" O
| 
  | O
Mrs. O
Bell B-PERSON
then O
opened O
a O
little O
portfolio O
, O
secured O
by O
a O
key O
, O
and O
drew O
thence O
a O
drawing O
in O

     | O
water O
- O
colours O
, O
the O
composition O

finish O
of O
which O
would O
have O
done O
no O
discredit O
to O
a O

     | O
professional O
artist O
. O
How O
the O
stout O
nerves O
of O
the O
young O
and O
athletic O
Michael B-PERSON
trembled O
as O
he O

     | O
received O
it O
! O
At O
first B-ORDINAL
his O
eyes O

the O
outline O

the O
colouring O

the O
whole O

" O
I O
am O
a O
fool O

letting O
the O
hand O
that O
held O
it O
drop O
beside O
him O
  O
" O
I O

positively O
can O

" O
I O
do O

much O
wonder O
at O

" O
replied O
Mr. O
Bell B-PERSON
  O
" O
but O
try O
again O

Michael B-PERSON

not O

for O
the O

placed O
upon O

balustrade O

over O

was O

turned O

     | O
if O
the O
pencil O
that O
drew O

flattered O
not O

it O
was O
one O
of O
the O
handsomest O
that O
nature O

     | O
The O
large O
expressive O
eyes O
, O
beaming O
with O
mingled O
softness O
and O
animation O
, O
were O
directed O
to O
some O

     | O
object O
out O
of O
the O
picture O

but O
at O
no O

distance O
  O
for O
the O
sweet O
smile O
that O
played O
about O
the O

mouth O
seemed O
to O

The O
figure O
of O
the O
young O
man O
thus O
represented O

was O
tall O

graceful O

His O
dress O
was O

     | O
the O
light O
summer O
garb O
of O
a O
southern O
climate O

an O

Italian B-NORP

its O
bright O
eye O
looking O
in O
the O

completed O
the O
group O

spoke O
in O
every O
part O

it O
a O
sort O
of O
graceful O
ease O

enjoyment O

that O
it O
was O
very O

" O
Can O
this O
indeed O
by O
my O
Edward B-PERSON

length O

after O
a O

silent O
examination O

it O
my O

true O

true O

that O
you O

Mr. O

" O
Is O
there O
nothing O
in O
the O

the O
eyes O

the O
sweet O
smile O

so O
like O
my O
own O

that O

     | O
strange O
as O
it O
is O
to O
see O
him O
so O
healthy O

tall O

graceful O

     | O
looking O

too O

so O
greatly O
like O
a O
gentleman O

do O
quite O
believe O
that O
this O

never O
drawn O

him O

you O
think O
that O

those O

now O

up O

You O
may O
well O
marvel O
at O
it O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
for O
it O
is O
no O
common O

But O
will O
you O
not O
think O
it O

     | O
something O
stranger O
still O

if O
I O
declare O

as O
I O
can O
do O
with O
all O
truth O

that O
you O
are O
yourself O
the O

     | O
primal O

" O
said O
Mr. O
Bell B-PERSON

" O
You O
look O
incredulous O

Michael B-PERSON

burying O
his O

in O
his O

" O
Oh O

can O

Mr. O
Bell B-PERSON
, O
smiling O
, O
" O
and O
all O
the O

exceedingly O
admired O

you O

Pleasure O

Mr. O
Bell B-PERSON

returned O
Michael B-PERSON

with O
something O
like O
a O
groan O
  O
" O
I O
have O
suffered O
a O
good O

     | O
deal O

how O
few O
years O
I O
had O

     | O
coming O

finding O
her O

I O
never O

very O

wretched O

making O
me O
practise O
for O
that O

" O

" O
Do O
you O
remember O
the B-TIME
very I-TIME
night I-TIME
it O
was O
acted O
, O
when O
you O
, O
and O
he O

Dr. O
Crockley B-PERSON
were O
in O
a O

room O
by O
yourselves O
, O
somewhere O
behind O
the O
scenes O
  O
do O
you O
remember O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
his O
beating O
and O

     | O
abusing O
you O
because O
you O
had O
cried O
upon O
the O
stage O

" O

" O
As O
well O
as O
if O
it O
had O
happened O
yesterday B-DATE

" O
replied O
the O
young O
man O

" O
I O
had O
to O
utter O
false O

     | O
lying O
praise O
about O
him O

and O
something O
I O
am O
sure O
there O
was O
about O
loving O
him O
as O
well O
as O
my O
dear O

     | O
mother O
. O
That O
I O
could O
not O
bear O
— O
and O
then O
it O
was O
that O
the O
tears O
burst O
out O
, O
though O
well O
I O
knew O

     | O
what O
I O
should O
pay O
for O
shedding O
them O

" O
| 
   | O
every O
want O
and O
every O
hardship O
were O
relieved O
from O
the B-TIME
first I-TIME
hour I-TIME
that O
Miss B-PERSON

     | O
Brotherton B-PERSON
saw O
her O
— O
and O
she O
died O
with O
the O
comfort O
of O
knowing O
that O
her O
poor O
Edward B-PERSON
would O
never O
|
     | O
have O
to O
labour O
more O
. O
Soon O
after O
her O
death O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
took O
your O
brother O
to O
London B-GPE
for O
the O
|
     | O
purpose O
of O
consulting O
the O
most O
able O
surgeons O
about O
his O
lameness O
. O
Their O
science O
did O
not O
fail O
|
     | O
them O
  O
for O
they O
predicted O
that O
with O
proper O
treatment O
he O
would O
outgrow O
it O
— O
and O
so O
he O
has O
, O
|
     | O
completely O
  O
being O
at O
this O
time O
not O
only O
the O
graceful O
well O
- O
made O
personage O
you O
see O
him O
|
     | O
represented O
there O
, O
but O
healthy O
, O
active O
, O
and O
gifted O
, O
as O
I O
hear O
, O
with O
a O
most O
rare O
intelligence O
. O
|
     | O
For O
reasons O
which O
it O
is O
not O
very O
difficulty O
to O
guess O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
thought O
that O
she O
and O
her O
|
     | O
young O
|  | O
protégées O
|  | O
would O
find O
themselves O
better O
off O
on O
the O
continent O
than O
in O
Lancashire B-GPE
  O
|
     | O
and O
from O
the O
time O
she O
first B-ORDINAL
left O
Milford B-GPE
Park I-GPE
to O
visit O
London B-GPE
, O
she O
has O
never O
returned O
to O
it O
. O
|
     | O
The O
place O
is O
now O
sold O
, O
and O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
has O
no O
longer O
any O
possessions O
in O
this O
neighbourhood O
. O
|
     | O
And O
now O
my O
dear O
boy O
, O
I O
think O
I O
have O
told O
you O
all O
, O
excepting O
the O
exact O
spot O
where O
they O
now O
are O
  O
|
     | O
and O
this O
I O
can O
not O
do O
, O
because O
our O
last O
letter O
from O
her O
informed O
us O
that O
they O
were O
just O
setting O
|
     | O
off O
upon O
a O
tour O
through O
Italy B-GPE
. O
She O
resided O
some O
time O
ago O
, O
for O
one B-DATE
year I-DATE
, O
at O
Paris B-GPE
, O
that O
the O
|
     | O
young O
people O
might O
acquire O
the O
language O
  O
but O
for O
the O
most O
part O
, O
Germany B-GPE
has O
been O
their O
home O
. O
It O
|
     | O
is O
there O
that O
your O
brother O
has O
received O
his O
education O
, O
and O
I O
think O
it O
very O
probable O
that O
it O
is O
|
     | O
there O
they O
will O
finally O
settle O
  O
for O
it O
is O
in O
the O
far O
- O
famed O
valley O
of O
the O
Rhingau B-GPE
that O
Miss B-ORG

     | I-ORG
Brotherton I-ORG
has O
purchased O
a O
spacious O
mansion O
, O
large O
enough O
, O
as O
she O
tells O
me O
, O
to O
accommodate O
|
     | O
half O
- O
a O
- O
dozen O
rich O
English B-NORP
families O
, O
with O
extensive O
and O
very O
beautiful O
grounds O
- O
around O
it O
, O
and O
|
     | O
all O
capabilities O
for O
being O
converted O
into O
a O
delicious O
residence O
. O
" O
|  
  | O
Here O
he O
ceased O
, O
and O
it O
was O
several B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
before O
poor O
Michael B-PERSON
was O
capable O
of O
uttering O
a O
|
     | O
single O
word O
in O
return O
. O
The O
mention O
of O
his O
mother O
— O
the O
hint O
that O
she O
had O
not O
long O
survived O
the O
|
     | O
hearing O
he O
was O
dead O
, O
wrung O
his O
heart O
anew O
, O
with O
grief O
as O
fresh O
as O
if O
he O
had O
lost O
her O
yesterday B-DATE
  O
|
     | O
and O
spite O
of O
his O
manly O
stature O
, O
the O
tears O
flowed O
silently O
, O
but O
plenteously O
, O
down O
his O
cheeks O
. O
|
     | O
Yet O
, O
even O
when O
he O
had O
conquered O
this O
, O
there O
was O
something O
so O
surprising O
in O
the O
present O
|
     | O
situation O
of O
his O
brother O
, O
something O
, O
that O
notwithstanding O
all O
the O
fond O
yearnings O
of O
his O
own O
|
     | O
heart O
, O
seemed O
to O
place O
them O
so O
widely O
asunder O
, O
that O
the O
joy O
which O
Mr. O
Bell B-PERSON
looked O
for O
, O
was O
less O
|
     | O
obvious O
, O
than O
an O
expression O
of O
almost O
timid O
embarrassment O
, O
as O
he O
said O
, O
| 
  | O
" O
Alas O
, O
sir O
! O
what O
shall O
I O
seem O
like O
amongst O
them O

speak O
of O
my O
dear O
Edward B-PERSON

education O
in O

of O

— O
my O
best O

and O
truly O
my O
only O

     | O
education O
has O
been O
looking O
at O
nature O
from O
the O
mountain O

side O
as O
I O
kept O
sheep O

all O
my O

what O
I O
have O
gathered O
from O
a O

mixed O

bought O
or O

borrowed O
during O
the B-DATE

How O

I O
present O
myself O

How O
they O
can O
welcome O

     | O
me O
? O
" O

   | O
of O
it O

I O
doubt O
not O
have O
preserved O
it O
among O
other O
treasures O

the O

" O

  | O
Mrs. O
Bell B-PERSON
immediately O
left O
the O
room O

presently O
returned O
with O
the O
letter O

" O
Take O
that O
letter O

read O

it O

Michael B-PERSON

hand O
trembled O

he O
took O
the O
letter O

silently O
obeying O
the O
instructions O
he O

received O

walked O
out O

embowered O

could O
not O

     | O
seating O
himself O
on O
a O

bench O
perused O
the O
following O

a O
mixture O
of O
trepidation O

eagerness O

imagined O

constantly O
called O

I O

drawn O
for O
you O
— O
witness O
the O
view O
from O
my O
beautiful O

      | O
terrace O
which O
I O
shall O
send O
with O
this O
letter O
. O
I O
wish O
I O
could O
have O
put O
my O
own O
phiz O
in O
it O
to O
show O
|
      | O
you O
how O
healthy O
and O
well O
I O
look O
  O
but O
unfortunately O
, O
you O
know O
, O
there O
is O
no O
point O
of O
sight O
from O
|
      | O
which O
an O
artist O
can O
catch O
a O
peep O
at O
himself O
without O
the O
aid O
of O
a O
looking O
- O
glass O
, O
and O
though O
I O
|
      | O
pretty O
nearly O
live O
upon O
my O
terrace O
, O
I O
have O
not O
yet O
taken O
either O
to O
sleeping O
or O
dressing O
there O
, O
|
      | O
so O
no O
mirror O
was O
at O
hand O
. O
But O
instead O
of O
myself O
I O
have O
given O
you O
Edward B-PERSON
  O
sometimes O
I O
do O
feel O
a O
|
      | O
little O
glorious O
as O
I O
look O
at O
him O
, O
and O
remember O
the O
delicate O
pale O
face O
and O
feeble O
limbs O
that O
|
      | O
greeted O
my O
first B-ORDINAL
sight O
of O
him O
in O
Hoxley B-ORG
- O
lane O
. O
He O
is O
now O
— O
but O
you O
will O
laugh O
at O
me O
if O
I O
|
      | O
attempt O
to O
describe O
him O
in O
words O
— O
the O
sketch O
I O
send O
is O
no O
bad O
likeness O
, O
and O
may O
give O
you O
a O
|
      | O
tolerably O
correct O
idea O
of O
the O
alteration O
that O
has O
taken O
place O
. O
As O
to O
my O
sweet O
Fanny B-PERSON
, O
though O
|
      | O
the O
attempt O
would O
have O
been O
a O
bold O
one O
, O
I O
meant O
to O
have O
given O
you O
a O
likeness O
of O
her O
too O
, O
but O
|
      | O
her O
attitude O
was O
so O
picturesquely O
pretty O
as O
she O
stood O
, O
unconscious O
of O
what O
I O
was O
about O
, O
that O
I O
|
      | O
contented O
myself O
with O
the O
back O
of O
her O
curly O
head O
— O
you O
shall O
have O
her O
face O
another O
time O
. O
| 
   | O
my O
having O
advanced O
in O
the O
precious O
labour O
of O
making O
these O
two B-CARDINAL
beloved O
beings O
|
      | O
happier O
. O
Were O
they O
merely O
ordinary O
young O
people O
, O
with O
average O
hearts O
and O
average O
capacities O
, O
I O
|
      | O
should O
still O
bless O
Heaven O
with O
a O
grateful O
heart O
, O
for O
having O
permitted O
me O
to O
be O
the O
means O
of O
|
      | O
changing O
their O
condition O
, O
from O
one O
of O
great O
suffering O
to O
a O
life O
of O
innocent O
enjoyment O
. O
But O
as O
|
      | O
it O
is O
, O
I O
know O
not O
how O
to O
be O
thankful O
enough O
! O
|  
  | O
" O
It O
seems O
to O
me O
, O
dear O
friends O
, O
however O
much O
I O
increase O
my O
acquaintance O
with O
other O
human O
|
      | O
beings O
, O
that O
Edward B-PERSON
and O
Fanny B-PERSON
are O
the O
noblest O
creatures O
in O
the O
world O
. O
Is O
it O
that O
suffering O
, O
|
      | O
being O
of O
necessity O
a O
part O
of O
our O
earthly O
nature O
, O
we O
can O
not O
arrive O
at O
the O
perfect O
development O
|
      | O
of O
all O
our O
faculties O
without O
it O
? O
Where O
it O
arrives O
in O
later O
life O
, O
perhaps O
, O
the O
effect O
, O
though O
|
      | O
inwardly O
healthful O
, O
may O
not O
show O
fruits O
so O
beautiful O
. O
There O
is O
in O
the O
minds O
of O
both O
of O
them O
, O
a O
|
      | O
brightness O
of O
intelligence O
, O
and O
a O
delicious O
calm O
of O
temper O
that O
I O
have O
never O
met O
elsewhere O
. O
It O
|
      | O
is O
as O
if O
a O
heavy O
weight O
that O
had O
been O
painfully O
crushing O
them O
, O
was O
suddenly O
removed O
, O
causing O
|
      | O
all O
the O
ordinary O
sensations O
of O
human O
existence O
to O
be O
felt O
as O
a O
luxury O
. O
Young O
as O
they O
are O
, O
they O
|
      | O
are O
full O
of O
instruction O
, O
right O
thinking O
, O
pure O
feeling O
, O
and O
a O
firmness O
of O
integrity O
which O
it O
is O
|
      | O
the O
best O
joy O
of O
my O
life O
to O
contemplate O
— O
and O
all O
this O
built O
on O
so O
firm O
a O
foundation O
of O
|
      | O
religious O
principle O
, O
that O
I O
can O
have O
no O
fears O
for O
its O
endurance O
. O
After O
this O
, O
it O
would O
be O
very O
|
      | O
weak O
and O
womanish O
folly O
to O
dwell O
much O
on O
their O
personal O
advantages O
, O
or O
even O
on O
the O
peculiar O
|
      | O
charm O
of O
their O
manners O
and O
conversation O
— O
yet O
they O
are O
gifts O
which O
bring O
a O
charm O
, O
to O
which O
it O
|
      | O
is O
difficult O
to O
be O
quite O
insensible O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Is O
it O
not O
strange O
, O
dear O
friends O
, O
that O
being O
such O
as O
I O
describe O
them O
, O
and O
having O
passed O
so O
|
      | O
large O
a O
portion O
of O
their O
lives O
together O
in O
the O
mutual O
contemplation O
of O
each O
other O
's O

      | O
excellence O
, O
is O
it O
not O
strange O
that O
they O
should O
not O
by O
this O
time O
be O
lovers O
, O
instead O
of O
friends O
? O
|
      | O
Yet O
such O
is O
not O
the O
case O
. O
That O
they O
love O
each O
other O
sincerely O
is O
most O
true O
, O
and O
I O
could O
give O
a O
|
      | O
thousand O
proofs O
that O
either O
would O
at O
all O
times O
gladly O
renounce O
amusement O
or O
pleasure O
of O
any O
|
      | O
kind O
, O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
the O
other O
  O
but O
they O
are O
not O

in O
love O
|  | O
. O
If O
I O
did O
not O
believe O
it O
|
      | O
impossible O
, O
considering O
the O
age O
of O
the O
parties O
when O
they O
parted O
, O
I O
should O
think O
that O
Fanny B-PERSON
's O
|
      | O
little O
heart O
had O
been O
buried O
in O
the O
grave O
of O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
the O
poor O
little O
fellow O
, O
whose O
early O
|
      | O
sufferings O
under O
the O
tender O
patronage O
of O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling I-PERSON
, O
first B-ORDINAL
roused O
my O
sleepy O
existence O
|
      | O
into O
action O
. O
She O
can O
not O
yet O
hear O
his O
name O
mentioned O
, O
without O
betraying O
a O
degree O
of O
emotion O
|
      | O
that O
it O
is O
painful O
to O
witness O
  O
and O
when O
, O
as O
sometimes O
happens O
, O
Edward B-PERSON
is O
taken O
for O
her O
|
      | O
brother O
, O
it O
seems O
to O
delight O
her O
. O
' O
Yes O
, O
yes O
, O
indeed O
he O
is O
my O
brother O
! O
I O
love O
him O
as O
such O
  O
and O
|
      | O
if O
you O
ask O
him O
, O
he O
will O
tell O
you O
that O
I O
am O
to O
him O
a O
dear O
and O
loving O
sister O
, O
' O
I O
have O
heard O
her O
|
      | O
say O
, O
and O
if O
Edward B-PERSON
had O
been O
asked O
, O
I O
do O
believe O
he O
would O
have O
answered O
, O
and O
truly O
too O
, O
in O
the O

      | O
same O
strain O
. O
| 
   | O
looked O
at O
with O
indifference O
. O
Yet O
, O
sometimes O
I O
am O
puzzled O
about O
Edward B-PERSON
! O
I O
think O
|
      | O
he O
is O
less O
gay O
and O
joyous O
than O
he O
used O
to O
be O
. O
At O
any O
time O
, O
indeed O
, O
the O
name O
of O
Michael B-PERSON
has O
|
      | O
ever O
been O
sufficient O
to O
bring O
an O
expression O
of O
profound O
and O
hopeless O
sorrow O
upon O
his O
fine O
|
      | O
countenance O
, O
which O
it O
wrings O
my O
heart O
to O
see O
  O
for O
, O
alas O
! O
how O
vain O
must O
be O
all O
my O
affection O
, O
|
      | O
all O
sisterly O
love O
, O
to O
help O
him O
there O
! O
But O
, O
incontestably O
of O
late O
, O
his O
spirits O
have O
been O
less O
|
      | O
gay O
than O
formerly O
. O
This O
, O
to O
tell O
you O
the O
truth O
, O
is O
the O
only O
drawback O
to O
the O
happiness O
I O
enjoy O
. O
|
      | O
Could O
Fanny B-PERSON
and O
Edward B-PERSON
learn O
to O
forget O
poor O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
I O
should O
hardly O
have O
a O
wish O
left O
  O
but O
I O
|
      | O
have O
little O
hope O
of O
this O
— O
his O
memory O
, O
I O
truly O
believe O
is O
too O
deeply O
engraven B-GPE
on O
their O
hearts O
, O
|
      | O
for O
any O
subsequent O
events O
to O
efface O
it O
. O
Sometimes O
, O
when O
I O
meditate O
on O
this O
sadly O
- O
enduring O
|
      | O
sorrow O
, O
I O
fancy O
that O
I O
should O
rejoice O
if O
they O
were O
both O
of O
them O
to O
fall O
in O
love O
, O
as O
a O
cure O
for O
|
      | O
it O
. O
But O
, O
alas O
! O
whenever O
that O
happens O
, O
what O
a O
breaking O
up O
of O
happiness O
it O
will O
be O
! O
for O
I O
can O
|
      | O
hardly O
hope O
to O
find O
a O
continental O
wife O
or O
husband O
for O
my O
adopted O
children O
, O
sufficiently O

      | O
English B-LANGUAGE
in O
habits O

character O

to O
permit O
my O
inviting O
them O

make O
a O
part O
of O
my O
family O

Yet O

      | O
marry O
abroad O

must O

think O
, O
if O
they O
marry O
at O
all O

for O
I O
will O
never O

my O
own O
free O
will O

      | O
expose O
them O
to O
the O
mortification O
likely O
to O
ensue O
upon O
such O
an O
explanation O
respecting O
their O
|
      | O
origin O
, O
as O
must O
be O
the O
consequence O
of O
any O
matrimonial O
negotiation O

England B-GPE

the O

the O
ample O

with O
their O
good O
education O

great O
natural O

suffice O
to O

very O
desirable O

almost O
any O

Mr. O

taking O
the O

Michael B-PERSON

not O

" O
No O

was O
the O
reply O

" O
but O
I O
can O
hardly O
tell O
you O
how O
I O
feel O

one B-CARDINAL
moment O

     | O
the O
idea O
that O
my O

him O

him O
in O
my O

to O
make O
me O
too O
happy O

then O
again O
, O
a O
sort O
of O

     | O
doubt O

sadness O
takes O
hold O
upon O

could O
ever O

" O

why O
not O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
? O
" O
demanded O
Mr. O
Bell B-PERSON
somewhat O
reproachfully O
  O
" O
after O
reading O
that O
letter O

can O
you O

it O

demanded O
Michael B-PERSON

     | O
while O
his O
paleness O
was O
changed O

one B-CARDINAL
deep O
sigh O
, O
he O
seemed O
to O

     | O
rouse O
himself O
  O

, O
as O
if O
endeavouring O
to O
shake O
off O
some O
feeling O
that O
oppressed O
him O
, O
he O
said O
, O

     | O
" O
But O
you O
have O
not O
told O
me O
yet O
, O
sir O

the O
reason O
why O
Miss O

  | O
" O
I O
am O
sorry O
to O
say O
, O
" O
replied O
Mr. O
Bell B-PERSON
, O
" O
that O
there O
are O
more O
reasons O
than O
one O
, O
for O
applying O
|
     | O
that O
pitying O
epithet O
to O
Miss O
Martha B-PERSON
Dowling I-PERSON
. O
In O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
place O
, O
she O
is O
greatly O
out O
of O
health O
, O
|
     | O
poor O
girl O
  O
and O
in O
the O
next O
, O
her O
father O
's O
affairs O
are O
said O
to O
be O
in O
a O
very O
tottering O
condition O
, O
|
     | O
in O
consequence O
of O
his O
having O
overloaded O
himself O
with O
a O
greater O
quantity O
of O
spun O
cotton O
than O
he O
|
     | O
can O
get O
any O
sale O
for O
. O
He O
is O
said O
to O
have O
lent O
out O
money O
, O
too O
, O
on O
some O
speculation O
which O
has O
not O
|
     | O
answered O
: O
and O
, O
in O
short O
, O
that O
it O
is O
rather O
a O
nice O
question O
, O
whether O
he O
will O
be O
able O
to O
get O
|
     | O
through O
his O
difficulties O
or O
not O

Another O
misfortune O
is O
, O
that O
Sir O

as O
soon O

possibly O
could O

Lady O

Why O

surely O

that O

   | O
To O
describe O
Michael B-PERSON
Armstrong I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
feeling O
as O
he O
took O
his O
solitary O
way O
along O
what O
seemed O
to O
him O
|
     | O
the O
most O
unfrequented O
fields O
he O
could O
find O
, O
would O
be O
both O
a O
difficult O
and O
an O
unnecessary O
task O
. O
|
     | O
That O
his O
heart O
swelled O
with O
thankfulness O
and O
joy O
can O
not O
be O
doubted O
  O
yet O
there O
was O
a O
vagueness O
|
     | O
and O
uncertainty O
as O
to O
what O
he O
ought O
immediately O
to O
do O
, O
which O
made O
him O
anxious O
and O
sad O
, O
even O
in O
|
     | O
the O
midst O
of O
hope O
and O
joy O
. O
The O
small O
sum O
he O
had O
been O
able O
to O
save O
from O
his O
wages O
had O
been O
|
     | O
spent O
, O
or O
very O
nearly O
so O
, O
since O
he O
set O
out O
upon O
his O
eventful O
expedition O
. O
He O
had O
already O

     | O
accepted O
a O
loan O
from O
the O
friendly O
old O
coachman O
of O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
, O
and O
he O
shrunk O
from O
the O
idea O
|
     | O
of O
contracting O
more O
debts O
, O
while O
unable O
to O
say O
with O
certainty O
when O
they O
should O
be O
paid O
. O
How O
|
     | O
then O
was O
he O
to O
reach O
his O
brother O
in O
his O
happy O
distant O
home O
? O
And O
where O
and O
how O
was O
he O
to O
pass O
|
     | O
the O
anxious O
interval O
that O
must O
of O
necessity O
intervene O
before O
he O
could O
even O
know O
to O
what O
point O
|
     | O
he O
should O
direct O
his O
pilgrim B-ORG
steps O
, O
even O
had O
he O
the O
means O
of O
setting O
forth O
? O
| 
   | O
inquired O
the O
distance O
to O
Dowling B-PERSON
Lodge I-PERSON
, O
and O
finding O
it O
was O
greater O
than O
he O
could O

     | O
traverse O
on O
foot O
with O
any O
hope O

returning O

decent O
time O
to O
occupy O
his O
newly O

taken O
lodging O
, O

     | O

morning I-TIME

when O
, O
by O
setting O
off O

might O
be O

     | O
able O
to O
make O
his O
visit O

Martha B-PERSON
, O
and O
perhaps O
report O
the O
result O
of O
it O
to O
Mr. O
Bell B-PERSON
, O
before O
he O

     | O
slept O

His O
mind O
had O
too O
much O
on O

itself O
for O
him O
to O
feel O
the B-TIME

one O
: O
an O

     | O
orchard O
close O
behind O
the O
little O

afforded O
him O
shade O

soft O
turf O
whereon O
to O
sit O

lie O
, O
or O

     | O
to O
pace O
backwards O
and O
forwards O
, O
with O
unequal O
steps O
, O
as O
he O
meditated O
on O
the O
chances O
for O
and O

     | O
against O
his O
ever O
being O
one O
in O
the O
happy O
, O
thrice O
happy O
party O
described O
by O
Miss O

. O
Nor O
|
     | O
had O
he O
wearied O
of O
these O
exciting O
, O
but O
most O
anxious O
thoughts O
, O
when O
the O
moon O
, O
and O
the O
stars O
, O
and O
|
     | O
the O
heavy O

warned O
him O
at O
length O
that O
the B-DATE

was O
gone O

night O
come O

And O
then O
he O

remembered O
that O
, O
in O
order O
to O
follow O
Mr. O

advice O
, O
he O
must O
prepare O
himself O
with O
a O
letter O
to O

     | O
Miss O

which O
it O
would O
be O
necessary O

write O
before O
he O
went O
to O
bed O

Fortunately O
his O

hotel O

was O
able O
to O
furnish O
the O
needful O
implements O
, O
and O
after O
a O
little O
reflection O
, O
he O

     | O
penned O
the O

note O

He O
takes O
the O
freedom O
of O
asking O

sealed O
it O
in O
the O

retired O

by O

of O
Dowling B-FAC
Lodge I-FAC

     | O
soon O
after O
the O
earliest O
servants O
were O
stirring O
. O
He O
had O
made O
up O
his O
mind O
to O
be O
the O
bearer O
of O
his O

     | O
own O
letter O
, O
and O
accordingly O
, O
having O
shown O
the O
address O
to O
the O
woman O
at O
the O
lodge O
as O
a O
reason O
for O
|
     | O
being O
permitted O
to O
enter O
, O
he O
approached O
the O
stately O
mansion O
by O
the O
road O
which O
led O
to O
the O
|
     | O
offices O
, O
and O
intrusting O
his O
epistle O
to O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
female O
he O
encountered O
, O
requested O
her O
to O
|
     | O
deliver O
it O
to O
Miss O
Martha B-PERSON
without O
delay O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Why O
she O
bean't O
up O
yet O
, O
" O
said O
the O
girl O
, O
looking O
at O
him O
, O
however O
, O
with O
the O
good O
- O
humoured O
smile O

     | O
with O
which O
light O

such O
very O
handsome O
lads O
as O
our O

     | O
Michael B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
" O
But O
perhaps O
you O
will O
be O
so O
good O
as O
to O
let O
her O
have O
it O
as O
soon O
as O
she O

" O
he O
replied O
, O

     | O
returning O
the O
smile O
. O
| 
   | O
the O
girl O
, O
" O
for O
her O
cough O
often O
wakes O
her O
before O

Will O
you O
wait O
for O
an O

     | O
answer O

" O

" O
I O

n't O
trouble O

staying O

replied O
Michael B-PERSON
  O
" O
but O
if O
you O
please O
you O
may O

     | O
tell O
the O
young O
lady O
that O
I O
will O
walk O
up O
and O
down O
the O
road O
till O
she O
can O

     | O
Miss O

walk O
out O
early B-TIME

the I-TIME

used O

do O

he O
added O

  | O
" O
That O
's O
just O
what O
she O
likes O
best O
, O
poor O
thing O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
girl O
. O
" O
But O
you O
need O
n't O
be O
afeard O

     | O
that O
she O
's O
gone O
out O
already O
  O

if O
she O

, O
I O
should O

sure O

she O

     | O
never O

the O
great O
door O
opened O
for O
her O
at O
this O
time O
of O
day O

for O
fear O
of O

my O
lady O

     | O
who O
always O
lies O
unaccountable O

  | O
" O
And O
does O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
rise O
early O
now O

" O
demanded O
Michael B-PERSON
with O
some O
anxiety O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
He O
! O
— O
not O
he O
! O
He O
eats O
and O
sleeps O
like O
a O
pig O
, O
they O
say O
  O
but O
he O
is O
grumpier O
than O
ever O
he O
was O
, O

     | O
both O
to O
men O
and O
maids O
too O
, O
since O
he O
married O
the O
new O
lady O

I O
wonder O
as O
I O
never O
happened O
to O
see O

     | O
you O
before O

" O
It O
is O
several B-DATE

I O
was O
last O

returned O
Michael B-PERSON
  O
" O
but O
run O
up O
stairs O
with O
it O
, O

     | O
there O
's O
a O
dear O
girl O
, O
will O
you O
? O
because O
I O
want O

get O
my O

be O
off O

" O

" O
You O
had O
better O
stop O
here O
till O
I O
come O
down O
again O

" O
replied O
his O
good O
- O
natured O
messenger O
, O

     | O
" O
instead O

walking O
up O

down O
the O
road O

without O
knowing O
whether O

down O

" O

  | O
And O
into O
the O
kitchen O
he O
went O
— O
the O
selfsame O
kitchen O
which O
just B-DATE
eight I-DATE
years I-DATE
before O
had O
been O

     | O
the O
scene O
of O
his O
painful O
examination O
by O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling I-PERSON
's O
servants O
. O
' O
He O
remembered O
the O
room O

     | O
perfectly O
  O
could O
have O
pointed O
out O
the O
exact O
spot O
where O
the O
awful O
housekeeper O
sat O
, O
and O
the O
place O
|
     | O
where O
he O
had O
himself O
stood O
, O
with O
no O
better O
champion O
to O
sustain O
his O
courage O
than O
the O
greasy O
|
     | O
kitchen O
- O
maid O
, O
whose O
pitying O
broad O
face O
, O
bent O
over O
him O
, O
he O
recollected O
as O
perfectly O
as O
if O
it O
had O
|
     | O
beamed O
upon O
him O
but O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
before I-DATE
. O
He O
was O
still O
deeply O
revolving O
these O
interesting O
|
     | O
reminiscences O
, O
and O
the O
strange O
contrast O
they O
offered O
to O
his O
present O
hopes O
, O
when O
his O
envoy O
|
     | O
returned O
— O
" O
Miss O
Martha B-PERSON
wants O
to O
know O
your O
name O
, O
young O
man O
, O
" O
she O
said O
, O
" O
but O
she O
is O
getting O
up O
, O
|
     | O
and O
will O
be O
walking O
in O
the O
park O
as O
usual O
, O
she O
says O
, O
presently O
, O
so O
it O
is O
likely O
enough O
that O
she O

     | O
will O
give O
you O
the O
answer O
herself O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Very O
well O
, O
" O
replied O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
perfectly O
satisfied O
— O
" O
good O
morning O
! O
— O
I O
am O
very O
much O
obliged O

     | O
to O
you O

" O
| 
  | O
" O
But O
you O
have O
n't O
told O
me O
your O
name O
, O
and O
Miss O
Martha B-PERSON
says O
that O
she O
should O
like O
to O
know O

     | O
it O
. O
" O

" O
My O
name O
is O
n't O
one O
that O
would O
make O
any O
difference O

" O
he O
replied O
, O
" O
so O
I O
wo O
n't O
trouble O
you O
to O
go O

     | O
up O
again O
about O
that O
— O
good O
bye O
! O
" O
And O
without O
waiting O
for O
any O
further O
discussion O
, O
he O
walked O
off O
, O
|
     | O
exceedingly O
well O
pleased O
at O
having O
arranged O
the O
wished O
for O

tête O
- O
à O
- O
tête O
|  | O
so O
|
     | O
satisfactorily O
. O
The O
noble O
dimensions O
of O
the O
park O
enabled O
Michael B-PERSON
to O
select O
a O
space O
amply O
|
     | O
sufficient O
for O
his O
promenade O
which O
was O
neither O
within O
sight O
of O
the O
mansion O
nor O
the O
lodge O
, O
and O
|
     | O
ere O
he O
had O
made O
many O
turns O
upon O
it O
, O
he O
perceived O
the O
lady O
he O
wished O
to O
see O
, O
approaching O
|
     | O
him O
. O
| 
   | O
morning O
none O
other O
was O
at O
all O
likely O
to O
be O
there O
  O
but O
she O
was O
too O
much O
altered O
|
     | O
for O
him O
to O
recognise O
her O
in O
any O
degree O
. O
He O
thought O
she O
was O
taller O
than O
he O
had O
expected O
to O
see O
|
     | O
her O
, O
but O
at O
any O
rate O
she O
was O
greatly O
thinner O
, O
and O
so O
delicately O
pale O
, O
that O
her O
appearance O
was O
|
     | O
rather O
a O
contrast O
, O
than O
a O
resemblance O
to O
what O
he O
had O
expected O
to O
meet O
. O
She O
was O
already O
near O
him O
|
     | O
when O
he O
turned O
upon O
the O
path O
, O
and O
met O
her O
. O
He O
stopped O
, O
took O
off O
his O
hat O
, O
and O
bowed O
|
     | O
respectfully O
. O
|  
  | O
" O
You O
are O
Miss O
Martha B-PERSON
Dowling I-PERSON
, O
ma'am O

" O
he O
said O
interrogatively O
. O

  | O
" O
Yes O

" O
replied O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
" O
that O

my O

when O
did O
I O

you O

I O
can O
never O

your O
kindness O

" O
| 
  | O
The O
pale O
cheek O
of O
Martha B-PERSON
was O
tinted O
with O
a O
vivid O
blush O
, O
as O
she O
exclaimed O
, O
" O
If O
it O
were O

     | O
possible O

if O
I O
did O
not O

that O

dead O

this O
is O
nonsense O

she O
added O
, O
recovering O

her O
composure O

" O

after O
a O
pause O
: O

an O
agitated O

" O

" O
Thank O
God O

cried O
poor O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
fervently O
clasping O
her O
hands O
, O
and O
raising O
her O
eyes O
to O
heaven O
, O

     | O
" O
you O
know O
not O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
what O
a O
load O
you O
have O
taken O
from O
my O
heart O
! O
I O
have O
for O
years B-DATE
lived O
under O
|
     | O
the O
dreadful O
weight O
of O
believing O
myself O
to O
be O
your O
murderer O
. O
The O
thought O
has O
haunted O
me O
by O
|
     | O
night O
, O
and O
rarely O
quitted O
me O
by O
day O
. O
And O
my O
poor O
father O
too O
! O
This O
crime O
at O
least O
he O
has O
not O
to O

     | O
answer O
for O
! O
" O
| 
   | O
though O
he O
had O
escaped O
with O
life O
from O
the O
terrible O
sufferings O
to O
which O
he O
had O
been O

     | O
exposed O
, O
he O
owed O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
but O
little O
gratitude O
for O
it O
. O
Fortunately O
, O
however O
, O
for O
his O

     | O
veracity O
, O
he O
was O
not O
called O
upon O
to O
answer O
this O
observation O
, O
for O
Martha B-PERSON
immediately O
added O
. O

" O
Does O
Miss O

" O
No O

he O
replied O
  O
" O
my O
brother O

is O
living O

her O
in O
some O

     | O
place O
abroad O

and O
till O
yesterday B-DATE
I O
have O
existed O
in O
the O
dismal O
belief O
that O

dead O

how O

you O
escape O

In O
answer O
to O
this O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
related O
, O
as O
briefly O
as O
he O
could O
contrive O
to O
do O
it O
, O
all O
that O
had O

     | O
happened O
to O
him O
, O
confessing O
freely O
that O
he O
had O
run O
away O
, O
and O
that O
he O
supposed O
he O
was O
liable O
to O
|
     | O
be O
sent O
back O
again O
to O
work O
out O
his O
time O
, O
if O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
discovered O
that O
he O
was O
alive O
, O
and O
if O
it O
|
     | O
were O
his O
pleasure O
to O
do O
it O
. O

  | O
" O
We O
will O
not O
talk O
of O
any O

" O
said O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
a O
bright O
blush O
again O

     | O
visiting O
her O
cheek O

" O
It O
would O
not O

certainly O
, O
for O
you O
to O
make O
yourself O
known O
here O

     | O
and O
I O
particularly O
desire O
that O
you O

not O

it O
. O
I O
am O
grateful O
, O
oh O
! O
most O
grateful O
, O
for O
your O

     | O
coming O
to O
tell O
me O
that O
the O
dismal O
news O
of O
your O
death O
was O
not O
true O

now O
that O
you O
have O
set O
my O

again O

about O
every O

that O

I O
shall O
always O
have O
the O

     | O
greatest O
regard O
for O
you O

Michael B-PERSON

I O
would O
a O

stronger O

she O
replied O

her O
whole O

lighted O
up O
with O
the O
most O

my O

all O

believing O
you O

the O

you O

Be O
very O

tell O
her O
that O
I O
owned O

" O

I O
had O
rather O

wanted O

at O
the O

my O

his O

by O

with O

The O
morning B-TIME
's O
walk O
had O
been O
a O
long O
one O
, O
even O
for O
Michael B-PERSON
Armstrong I-PERSON
, O
and O
right O
glad O
was O
he O
to O
|
     | O
find O
himself O
again O
in O
the O
neatly O
- O
sanded O
kitchen O
of O
his O
little O
inn O
, O
with O
a O
loaf O
and O
cheese O

     | O
before O
him O
, O
of O
sufficient O
dimensions O
to O
resist O
any O
attacks O
he O
could O
make O
upon O
them O
. O
A O
moderate O

     | O
proportion O
of O
beer O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
solid O
meal O
these O
afforded O
, O
refreshed O
him O
so O
effectually O
|
     | O
that O
he O
determined O
to O
take O
his O
leave O
of O
Mr. O
Bell B-PERSON
that B-TIME
night I-TIME
, O
preparatory O
to O
setting O
off O
on O
his O

     | O
return O
to O
Westmorland B-PERSON
on O
the B-TIME
following I-TIME
morning I-TIME
, O
in O
order O
to O
bid O
farewell O
to O
his O
good O
old O
master O
|
     | O
there O
. O
On O
the O
subject O
of O
Martha B-PERSON
's O
bank O
- O
notes O
he O
meant O
to O
be O
entirely O
guided O
by O
the O
advice O
of O
|
     | O
the O
clergyman O
, O
being O
equally O
fearful O
of O
offending O
, O
or O
rather O
of O
paining O
their O
generous O
owner O
by O
|
     | O
refusing O
to O
accept O
them O
, O
or O
of O
depriving O
her O
of O
what O
might O
be O
hereafter O
useful O
by O
agreeing O
to O
|
     | O
do O
so O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
have O
seen O
Miss O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
sir O
! O
" O
were O
his O
first B-ORDINAL
words O
on O
entering O
Mr. O
Bell B-PERSON
's O
parlour O
, O
and O
both O
|
     | O
look O
and O
accent O
showed O
that O
the O
interview O
had O
been O
an O
interesting O
one O
. O
" O
But O
, O
alas O
! O
she O
is O
|
     | O
greatly O
altered O
, O
" O
he O
added O
, O
restraining O
with O
difficulty O
the O
tears O
that O
rose O
to O
his O
eyes O
. O
" O
I O
|
     | O
fear O
she O
is O
very O
ill O
  O
— O
but O
she O
was O
glad O
— O
oh O
! O
so O
glad O
to O
see O
me O
, O
sir O
! O
She O
has O
been O
fretting O
, O
|
     | O
poor O
dear O
young O
lady O
, O
under O
the O
false O
notion O
that O
she O
had O
been O
to O
blame O
about O
me O
  O
but O
, O
thank O
|
     | O
Heaven O
! O
think O
she O
knows O
better O
now O
, O
and O
perhaps O
when O
her O
mind O
is O
at O
ease O
again O
she O
may O
recover O
|
     | O
health O
. O
I O
ca O
n't O
bear O
to O
think O
how O
pale O
and O
thin O
she O
is O
grown O
, O
and O
all O
about O
me O
, O
to O
whom O
she O
was O
|
     | O
the O
best O
and O
kindest O
friend O
that O
ever O
poor O
boy O
had O
. O
And O
see O
, O
sir O
, O
what O
she O
has O
done O
now O
! O
" O
|
     | O
continued O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
drawing O
forth O
the O
roll O
of O
notes O
from O
his O
pocket O
. O
" O
Here O
is O
a O
large O
sum O
of O
|
     | O
money O
, O
I O
believe O
. O
She O
did O
not O
rightly O
know O
how O
much O
it O
was O
herself O
, O
she O
told O
me O
, O
because O
she O
|
     | O
had O
kept O
on O
putting O
by O
what O
she O
did O
not O
want O
, O
and O
had O
never O
counted O
how O
much O
it O
came O
to O
— O
and O
|
     | O
I O
'm O
sure O
I O
have O
not O
counted O
it O
either O
  O
but O
whether O
it O
is O
little O
or O
much O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
feel O
quite O
|
     | O
certain O
whether O
I O
ought O
to O
take O
it O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Mr. O
Bell B-PERSON
smiled O
at O
the O
unusual O
manner O
in O
which O
the O
rich O
- O
looking O
, O
but O
carelessly O
- O
packed O
roll O
|
     | O
of O
paper O
had O
passed O
from O
one O
hand O
to O
the O
other O
. O
Before O
he O
examined O
the O
contents O
he O
questioned O
|
     | O
Michael B-PERSON
as O
to O
all O
that O
the O
generous O
- O
hearted O
girl O
had O
said O
to O
him O
, O
on O
bestowing O
it O
, O
and O
the O
|
     | O
young O
man O
's O
faithful O
answers O
soon O
convinced O
him O
that O
there O
would O
be O
little O
kindness O
to O
the O
|
     | O
self O
- O
reproaching O
Martha B-PERSON
in O
refusing O
a O
donation O
which O
she O
evidently O
considered O
as O
an O
atonement O
, O
|
     | O
and O
which O
would O
, O
he O
doubted O
not O
, O
by O
its O
application O
to O
Michael B-PERSON
's O
necessities O
, O
do O
more O
towards O
|
     | O
healing O
her O
wounded O
mind O
than O
any O
other O
thing O
whatever O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
You O
must O
not O
refuse O
the O
gift O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Bell B-PERSON
, O
after O
hearing O
his O
narrative O
to O
the O
|
     | O
end O
. O
" O
I O
do O
not O
wonder O
, O
little O
as O
she O
has O
been O
to O
blame O
in O
the O
matter O
, O
at O
her O
having O
suffered O
|
     | O
greatly O
for O
all O
that O
she O
innocently O
made O
you O
suffer O
  O
nor O
am O
I O
at O
all O
surprised O
, O
since O
it O
was O
in O
|
     | O
her O
power O
to O
do O
so O
, O
that O
she O
should O
wish O
to O
make O
you O
this O
atonement O
. O
It O
comes O
at O
a O
lucky O
|
     | O
moment O
, O
my O
dear O
boy O
, O
for O
not O
only O
will O
it O
enable O
you O
to O
present O
yourself O
before O
Miss B-PERSON
|
     | I-PERSON
Brotherton I-PERSON
, O
without O
throwing O
yourself O
, O
as O
you O
said O
yesterday B-DATE
, O
upon O
her O
charity O
, O
but O
I O
suspect O
|
     | O
it O
may O
go O
far O
in O
assisting O
your O
hopes O
of O
entering O
into O
some O
business O
, O
which O
may O
enable O
you O
to O
|
     | O
support O
yourself O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Mr. O
Bell B-PERSON
then O
opened O
the O
bundle O
of O
notes O
, O
and O
found O
that O
they O
amounted O
to O
rather O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
|
     | I-CARDINAL
five B-QUANTITY
hundred I-QUANTITY
pounds I-QUANTITY
  O
a O
sum O
which O
, O
to O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
appeared O
so O
enormous O
that O
he O
uttered O
something O
|
     | O
like O
a O
remonstrance O
against O
the O
opinion O
which O
advised O
his O
appropriating O
the O
whole O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Did O
you O
not O
tell O
me O
, O
sir O
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
" O
that O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling I-PERSON
's O
affairs O
were O
not O
considered O

     | O
to O
be O
in O
so O
flourishing O
a O
state O
as O
they O
had O
been O
? O
And O
may O
not O
this O
money O
be O
wanted O
by O
Miss O

     | O
Martha B-PERSON
in O
case O
he O
should O
really O
become O
involved O
in O
difficulties O
? O
" O
| 
   | O
will O
be O
able O
to O
secure O
sufficient O
from O
the O
relics O
of O
his O
enormous O
wealth O
to O
|
     | O
maintain O
his O
family O
in O
easy O
circumstances O
. O
A O
sum O
like O
this O
, O
my O
dear O
boy O
, O
is O
but O
a O
drop O
in O
such O

     | O
an O
ocean O
. O
" O
|  
  | O
Michael B-PERSON
resisted O
no O
longer O
, O
and O
this O
point O
being O
settled O
, O
his O
plan O
of O
operations O
was O
soon O
|
     | O
arranged O
. O
In O
deference O
to O
Martha B-PERSON
's O
fears O
for O
his O
safety O
, O
he O
decided O
not O
to O

     | O
friend O
Richard B-PERSON
Smithson I-PERSON
, O

     | O
moreover O
to O
convey O

was O
to O

Michael B-PERSON

road O

would O
probably O
arrive O
within O
a B-DATE
week I-DATE
or O
two B-CARDINAL
, O
and O
Mr. O
Bell B-PERSON
recommended O
|
     | O
that O
, O
having O
paid O
his O
farewell O
visit O
to O
Westmorland B-PERSON
he O
should O
return O
to O
Fairly O
, O
and O
there O
equip O
|
     | O
himself O
in O
such O
a O
manner O
as O
would O
be O
suitable O
for O
presenting O
himself O
before O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
. O
|
     | O
Mr. O
Bell B-PERSON
agreed O
to O
take O
the O
custody O
of O
his O
treasure O
, O
till O
his O
return O
, O
and O
with O
his O
bundle O
again O

     | O
on O
his O
shoulder O
, O
and O
five B-QUANTITY
pounds I-QUANTITY
in O
his O
pocket O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
set O
off O
to O
walk O
over O
the O
fells O
and O
|
     | O
moors O
he O
had O
to O
traverse O
, O
with O
a O
lightness O
of O
spirit O
that O
seemed O
to O
strew O
the O
deserts O
with O
|
     | O
flowers O
, O
and O
made O
every O
blast O
that O
blew O
upon O
him O
as O
soft O
and O
sweet O
as O
the O
gales O
of O
Araby B-NORP
. O
It O
|
     | O
was O
not O
the O
least O
, O
perhaps O
, O
of O
his O
pleasures O
, O
as O
he O
strode O
sturdily O
along O
, O
to O
compare O
his O

     | O
present O
walk O
with O
that O
which O
had O
conducted O
him O
from O
the B-LOC
Deep I-LOC
Valley I-LOC
to O
Ashleigh B-PERSON
, O
four B-DATE
years I-DATE

     | O
before O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
suffering O
, O
the O
terror O
, O
and O
the O
final O
agony O
of O
that O
expedition O
could O
not O
come O
over O
his O

     | O
mind O
, O
however O
, O
without O
throwing O
a O
shade O
over O
his O
gladness O
  O
but O
it O
chastened O
without O
obscuring O

     | O
the O
bright O
combination O
of O
objects O
that O
glowed O
in O
the O
prospect O
before O
him O
  O
and O
, O
altogether O
, O
it O
|
     | O
would O
be O
difficult O
to O
find O
any O
walk O
on O
record O
more O
replete O
with O
enjoyment O
than O
this O
of O
Michael B-PERSON

     | O
to O
the O
humble O
mountain O
- O
home O
that O
had O
so O
kindly O
sheltered O
him O
. O
| 
  | O
It O
was O
with O
a O
very O
flattering O
mixture O
of O
joy O
and O
sorrow O
that O
the O
good O
statesman O
and O
his O
|
     | O
family O
accepted O
Michael B-PERSON
's O
farewell O
, O
and O
listened O
to O
his O
happy O
hopes O
  O
and O
it O
was O
amidst O
|
     | O
blessings O
and O
hearty O
good O
wishes O
that O
once O
again O
he O
sallied O
forth O
to O
wend O
his O
way O
for O
the O
last O

     | O
time O
over O
the O
mountains O
, O
and O
bid O
a O
fond O
and O
lingering O
adieu O
to O
his O
beloved O
lakes O
and O
tarns O
. O
He O

     | O
felt O
that O
those O
had O
been O
to O
him O
as O
teachers O
and O
preachers O
, O
elevating O
his O
heart O
and O
imagination O
, O

     | O
and O
preparing O
him O
, O
more O
effectually O

that O
he O
still O

     | O
expected O
an O
answer O
to O
a O
very O
cautiously O
- O
worded O
epistle O
which O
he O
had O
ventured O
to O
address O

informing O
her O
that O

was O

that O
any O

Michael B-PERSON
was O
at O
breakfast O
with O
his O
kind O
and O
hospitable O
friends O
, O
when O
a O
lad O
, O
bearing O
great O
|
     | O
marks O
of O
hasty O
travelling O
in O
his O
appearance O
, O
made O
his O
way O
into O
the O
room O
, O
and O
with O
a O
look O
that O
|
     | O
seemed O
to O
prophesy O
eventful O
tidings O
, O
if O
he O
were O
but O
asked O
for O
them O
, O
delivered O
a O
letter O
to O
Mr. O
|
     | O
Bell B-ORG
. O
This O
proved O
, O
however O
, O
to O
be O
only O
a O
blank O
cover O
, O
enclosing O
one O
to O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
which O
was O
|
     | O
handed O
to O
him O
, O
while O
the O
eyes O
of O
his O
host O
and O
hostess O
fixed O
themselves O
with O
some O
anxiety O
on O
his O
|
     | O
face O
. O
Michael B-PERSON
tore O
open O
the O
despatch O
, O
and O
changed O
colour O
as O
he O
read O
it O
. O
Then O
, O
giving O
an O
|
     | O
intelligible O
glance O
at O
the O
messenger O
who O
ceased O
not O
to O
wipe O
his O
forehead O
with O
one B-CARDINAL
arm O
, O
while O
he O
|
     | O
held O
his O
hat O
squeezed O
to O
his O
side O
with O
the O
other O
, O
he O
said O
, O
" O
I O
should O
like O
to O
speak O
to O
you O
about O

Mr. O

" O

kitchen O

said O
the O
clergyman O
, O
" O

some O
breakfast O

know O

" O
| 
  | O
Though O
evidently O
disappointed O
at O
being O
thus O
dismissed O
unquestioned O
, O
the O
boy O
consoled O
himself O
|
     | O
with O
the O
hope O
of O
a O
kitchen O
audience O
, O
and O
making O
his O
reverence O
, O
retired O
. O

  | O
" O
What O
in O
the O
world O
have O
you O
got O
there O

demanded O
Mr. O

" O

" O

  | O
" O
No O

replied O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
" O
very O
far O
from O

It O
is O
from O
Miss O

" O

" O
What O

can O
not O

what O

" O
Poor O
girl O
! O
This O
is O
sad O
indeed O
! O
" O
cried O
Mr. O
Bell B-PERSON
. O
" O
I O
imagine O
, O
though O
she O

not O
explain O

herself O

that O
her O

fallen O

Yet O
I O
can O
not O
guess O
what O
you O
can O

     | O
do O
for O
her O
. O
However O
, O
you O
must O
go O
immediately O
of O
course O
  O

you O
had O
better O
hire O
a O
chaise O
that O

     | O
no O
time O
may O
be O
lost O

And O
I O
would O
advise O
you O
, O
Michael B-PERSON

to O
take O
with O
you O
the O
pocket O
- O
book O
which O

     | O
Mrs. O
Bell B-PERSON
packed O
up O
for O
you O
so O
carefully O
last B-TIME
night I-TIME

I O
fear O
that O
it O
is O

too O
likely O
your O

     | O
prediction O
will O
be O
fulfilled O
already O
, O

that O
the O
poor O
young O
lady O
may O
be O
glad O
to O
have O
some O
of O

     | O
her O
notes O

" O

" O

  | O
Little O
time O
was O
lost O
in O
setting O
off O

certainly O
much O
before O
his O
arrival O

     | O
by O
Martha B-PERSON

Michael B-PERSON

left O
his O

at O
a O
public O

house O
near O
the O
lodge O

was O
walking O

     | O
towards O
the O
mansion O
by O
the O

path O
in O
which O
he O
had O
so O
lately O
parted O
from O
her O

On O
entering O
the O
|
     | O
kitchen O
, O
the O
scene O
which O
met O
his O
eyes O
, O
explained O
at O
the O
very O
first B-ORDINAL
glance O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
|
     | O
business O
carrying O
on O
upon O
the O
premises O
. O
A O
number O
of O
men O
were O
standing O
about O
, O
some O
few O
occupied O
|
     | O
in O
sticking O
slips O
of O
paper O
inscribed O
" O
Lot O

— O
, O
" O
upon O
a O
variety O
of O
articles O
which O
appeared O
to O

     | O
have O
been O
collected O
there O
for O
the O
purpose O

Others O
, O
with O
black O
canvass O
aprons O

paper O
caps O
, O

     | O
were O
coming O

going O
with O
no O
very O
apparent O
purpose O

while O
another O
set O

with O
cold O
meat O
and O

     | O
beer O

flagons O
before O
them O
, O
sat O
round O
a O
small O
table O
in O
a O
corner O
, O
discoursing O
upon O
themes O

     | O
appeared O

occasion O

much O
merriment O

But O
among O
all O
these O

there O
was O
not O
one O
that O
looked O
like O
a O
servant O
of O
the O
house O
  O
and O
taking O

     | O
advantage O
of O
the O
confusion O

seemed O
to O
license O
the O
freedom O

walked O
on O
without O
speaking O

     | O
to O
any O
of O
them O
, O
and O
determined O
to O
trust O
to O
his O
memory O
for O
finding O
the O
small O
morning O
- O
parlour O

     | O

used O
to O
contain O
all O
poor O
Martha B-PERSON

little O
literary O
personalties O
, O

in O
which O
all O
his O

     | O
reading O

writing O
lessons O
had O
been O
received O
. O
| 
  | O
Neither O
his O
recollection O
nor O
his O
conjeture O
deceived O
him O

he O
found O
the O
apartment O

sought O
, O
|
     | O
and O
on O
opening O
the O
door O
, O
discovered O
Martha B-PERSON
sitting O
there O
. O
But O
she O
was O
not O
, O
as O
he O
had O
hoped O
to O

find O
her O

alone O

On O
a O
sofa O
placed O

quantity O

on O
the O
sofa O

     | O
beside O
her O

and O
her O
long O
lean O
fingers O
were O
actively O
employed O
in O
selecting O
the O
most O
precious O

     | O
articles O
, O
enveloping O
them O
in O
the O
wool O

then O
cramming O
them O
into O
a O
large O
basket O
that O
stood O

     | O
before O
her O
, O
— O
sometimes O
selecting O
one O
, O
either O
smaller O

more O
precious O
than O
the O
rest O
, O
and O

thrusting O
it O
into O
her O
pocket O

up O
her O
sleeve O

A O
large O
Indian B-NORP
screen O
was O
spread O
before O
the O

     | O
door O
, O
which O
induced O
Michael B-PERSON

on O
hearing O
a O
voice O
that O

to O
remain O

decide O

his O
entrance O

her O
any O

said O
the O
upright O

in O
a O
shrill O
voice O

in O
a O
tone O

sure O

Martha B-PERSON

no O

she O
rose O
from O
her O
chair O
, O
and O
Michael B-PERSON
stepped O
back O
into O
the O
passage O
, O

     | O
that O

might O
not O
meet O
him O

" O

the O
poor O
girl O

on O
catching O
sight O

  | O
Michael B-PERSON
followed O
her O
to O
the O
well O
- O
remembered O
drawing O
- O
room O

which O
had O
so O
often O
witnessed O
the O

     | O
display O
of O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
's O
munificent O
charity O
, O
by O
showing O
him O
off O
to O
all O
the O
neighbourhood O
. O
The O
|
     | O
recollection O
was O
very O
hateful O
to O
him O
, O
yet O
the O
right O
- O
hearted O
lad O
felt O
a O
pang O
as O
he O
accompanied O

     | O
his O
benefactress O
into O
this O
greatly O
- O
altered O
scene O
of O
former O
splendour O
. O
The O
whole O
house O
was O
under O
|
     | O
preparation O
for O
a O
sale O
by O
auction O
, O
and O
nothing O
could O
exceed O
the O
speaking O
state O
of O
gilded O
|
     | O
desolation O
which O
this O
fine O
room O
exhibited O
. O

  | O
Never O
mind O
the O
confusion O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
! O
Just O
step O
over O
these O
curtains O
— O
we O
can O
sit O
down O
, O
up O
in O

     | O
that O
corner O
of O
the O
room O
— O
take O
care O
of O
the O
mirrors O
, O
my O
dear O
boy O
! O
Surely O
they O
have O
thrown O
these O

     | O
costly O
things O
about O
more O
heedlessly O
than O
was O
necessary O
! O
" O
said O
poor O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
as O
she O
led O
the O
way O

     | O
rather O
over O
, O
then O
through O
the O
scattered O
mass O
of O
splendid O
furniture O
with O
which O
the O
room O
was O

     | O
strewed O
. O

" O
It O
is O
strange O

Michael B-PERSON
, O
" O
she O
resumed O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
they O
had O
seated O
themselves O
in O
a O
clear O
space O
|
     | O
of O
six B-QUANTITY
feet I-QUANTITY
wide O
, O
where O
two B-CARDINAL
chairs O
were O
standing O
near O
one O
of O
the O
windows O
, O
— O
" O
it O
is O
strange O
, O
|
     | O
most O
strange O
, O
that O
you O
should O
be O
the O
only O
person O
that O
I O
could O
think O
of O
to O
assist O
my O
poor O
father O

     | O
in O
his O
misery O
! O
You O
who O
have O
suffered O
so O
severely O
from O
— O
from O
his O
displeasure O
. O
But O
I O
found O
out O
, O
|
     | O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
that O
you O
had O
a O
kind O
, O
good O
heart O
, O
when O
you O
used O
to O
talk O
to O
me O
of O
your O
mother O
and O
poor O
|
     | O
Teddy O
. O
It O
was O
that O
which O
made O
me O
take O
notice O
of O
you O
then O
, O
and O
it O
is O
that O
which O
makes O
me O
ask O
for O

     | O
your O
assistance O
now O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
And O
happy O
and O
thankful O
shall O
I O
be O
if O
I O
can O
do O
you O
any O
good O
, O
Miss O
Martha B-PERSON
! O
" O
replied O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
|
     | O
eagerly O
. O
" O
I O
have O
brought O
back O
the O
notes O

all O

about O
twelve O
pounds O

that O
has O
been O
laid O
out O

for O
me O

It O
is O
a O
very O
large O
sum O

I O
trust O
it O
will O
be O
useful O

" O
| 
   | O
failed O
him O
, O
and O
at O
times O
his O
temper O
has O
been O
so O
variable O
that O
I O
have O
seen O
him O
|
     | O
violently O
angry O
, O
and O
very O
intemperate O
in O
his O
language O
, O
one B-TIME
minute I-TIME
, O
and O
enduring O
the O
insolence O

     | O
of O

with O
the O
meekness O
of O
a O
child O

the O
next O
. O
And O
now O
— O
In O
short O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
I O
|
     | O
greatly O
fear O
that O
his O
reason O
is O
shaken O
by O
the O
misfortunes O
that O
have O
fallen O
upon O
him O
. O
He O
has O
|
     | O
kept O
all O
his O
commercial O
disasters O
so O
completely O
to O
himself O
, O
that O
not O
even O
his O
most O
confidential O
|
     | O
agents O
were O
at O
all O
aware O
of O
their O
extent O
  O
and O
I O
therefore O
hope O
that O
if O
I O
can O
contrive O
to O
remove O
|
     | O
him O
from O
this O
melancholy O
scene O
, O
his O
mind O
will O
be O
relieved O
by O
felling O
that O
the O
worst O
is O
over O
, O
|
     | O
and O
that O
I O
may O
have O
the O
exceeding O
happiness O
of O
seeing O
him O
restored O
to O
reason O
and O
to O
health O
. O
" O

  | O
" O
And O
in O
what O
way O
then O
can O
I O
be O
useful O
to O
you O
, O
my O
dear O
Miss O
Martha B-PERSON
? O
I O
dare O
not O
combat O
your O
|
     | O
will O
, O

it O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
if O
his O
creditors O
are O
stripping O
his O
house O
in O
this O
way O

such O
a O
sum O

     | O
as O
you O

him O

Michael B-PERSON

   | O
Do O
you O
think O
you O
could O
manage O

get O
a O

at O

for O
my O

When O
he O
has O

he O
will O
be O
safe O
  O

I O

     | O
greatly O
fear O
some O
difficulty O
about O
it O

" O

  | O
While O
Martha B-PERSON
was O
thus O
explaining O
her O
hopes O
and O
fears O
, O
the O
sound O
of O
carriage O
- O
wheels O
was O
heard O
|
     | O
slowly O
approaching O
by O
the O
road O
which O
led O
to O
the O
chief O
entrance O
, O
and O
which O
passed O
at O
no O
great O
|
     | O
distance O
from O
the O
window O
at O
which O
they O
were O
sitting O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Here O
comes O
Dr. O
Crockley B-PERSON
! O
" O
she O
exclaimed O
  O
" O
I O
am O
very O
glad O
his O
visit O
will O
be O
over O
so O
early O
. O

     | O
This O
will O
give O
me O
time O
for O
preparation O

" O

  | O
But O
she O
was O
mistaken O
  O
the O
equipage O
she O
heard O
a O
approaching O
was O
not O
the O
recently O
set O

up O

of O

Dr. O
Crockley B-PERSON

but O
the O
donkey O
- O
chair O
of O
the O
ever O
active O
Mrs. O
Gabberly B-PERSON
. O
Nothing O
could O
be O
much O
|
     | O
farther O
from O
poor O
Martha B-PERSON
's O
inclination O
than O
encountering O
the O
prying O
old O
woman O
at O
this O
moment O
  O
|
     | O
but O
having O
hastily O
told O
Michael B-PERSON
to O
appear O
as O
if O
he O
were O
employed O
in O
taking O
a O
catalogue O
of O
the O

     | O
furniture O
, O
for O
which O
purpose O
, O
paper O
, O
pens O
, O
and O
ink O
lay O
conveniently O
ready O
on O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
|
     | O
marbleslabs O
, O
she O
hurried O
out O
into O
the O
hall O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
meeting O
the O
physician O
, O
and O
|
     | O
attending O
him O
as O
usual O
to O
her O
father O
— O
so O
that O
the O
avoiding O
Mrs. O
Gabberly B-PERSON
was O
impossible O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Oh O
, O
my O
poor O
dear O
Martha B-PERSON
! O
that O
's O
you O
, O
is O
it O
? O
Well O
now O
! O
you O
was O
just O
the O
person O
I O
wanted O
to O
|
     | O
see O
. O
But O
I O
do O
wonder O
you O
did O
not O
get O
off O
with O
your O
father O
, O
poor O
man O
! O
when O
he O
made O
his O
escape O
, O

     | O
this B-TIME
morning I-TIME
, O
" O
said O
the O
unchanged O
little O
lady O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
know O
not O
what O
you O
mean O
, O
Mrs. O
Gabberly B-PERSON
, O
" O
replied O
Martha B-PERSON
gravely O
. O
" O
My O
poor O
father O
has O
been O
|
     | O
extremely O
ill O
, O
and O
is O
at O
this O
moment O
confined O
to O
his O
bed O
. O
" O
The O
old O
lady O
gave O
a O
wink O
with O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
|
     | O
her O
little O
cunning O
black O
eyes O
, O
and O
nodding O
her O
head O
very O
expressively O
, O
replied O
, O
" O
Old O
birds O
are O
|
     | O
not O
caught O
with O
chaff O
, O
my O
dear O
. O
" O

  | O
" O
What O
is O
it O
that O
you O
mean O
, O
Mrs. O
Gabberly B-PERSON
— O
that O
you O
do O
not O
believe O
me O
? O
" O
said O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
|
     | O
indignantly O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
You O
are O
very O
foolish O
to O
bawl O
out O
in O
that O
manner O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
with O
that O
young O
fellow O
that O
's O

     | O
cataloguing O
in O
there O
, O
close O
within O
hearing O
. O
Mind O
, O
it O
is O
your O
fault O
and O
not O
mine O
, O
if O
he O
suspects O

     | O
any O
thing O
from O
your O
violence O

" O

   | O
good O
as O
to O
see O
my O
poor O
father O
, O
Mrs. O
Gabberly B-PERSON
? O
I O
would O
not O
wish O
you O
to O
stay O
long O

     | O
with O
him O
, O
for O
he O
is O
very O
feverish O
  O
but O
I O
dare O
say O
he O
would O
take O
it O
very O
kindly O
if O
you O
will O
just O
|
     | O
come O
in O
to O
inquire O
for O
him O
. O
" O

  | O
Looking O
a O
good O
deal O
surprised O
, O
but O
accepting O
the O
invitation O
with O
great O
alacrity O
, O
Mrs. O
|
     | O
Gabberly B-PERSON
began O
to O
mount O
the O
stairs O
  O
exceedingly O
well O
pleased O
to O
have O
an O
opportunity O
of O
|
     | O
procuring O
so O
excellent O
a O
ticket O
of O
admission O
to O
every O
house O
in O
the O
neighbourhood O
, O
as O
this O

     | O
ocular O
demonstration O
of O
the O
actual O
condition O
of O
the O
fallen O
knight O
would O
furnish O

Michael B-PERSON
, O
in O

     | O
compliance O
with O
the O
order O
he O
had O
received O
, O
followed O
after O
  O
and O
in O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
, O
found O
himself O

     | O
once O
more O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
man O
under O
whose O
tyranny O
he O
had O
suffered O
so O
terribly O
. O
But O
a O
|
     | O
harder O
heart O
than O
Michael B-PERSON
's O
might O
have O
been O
softened O
into O
forgiveness O
and O
forgetfulness O
of O
all O

     | O
former O
injuries O
, O
by O
the O
miserable O
aspect O
of O
the O
wretched O
man O
who O
lay O
stretched O
upon O
the O

     | O
splendid O
bed O

he O
could O
no O
longer O

His O
steadfast O

daughter O
— O
the O
only O
earthly O
good O
that O
avenging O
Heaven O

entered O
first B-ORDINAL

intending O

     | O
to O
announce O
the O
visit O
of O
Mrs. O
Gabberly B-PERSON
  O
but O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
started O
up O
in O
bed O
, O
and O
before O
she O
could O
|
     | O
speak O
, O
cried O
out O
, O
" O
Do O
not O

that O
devil O
Crockley B-PERSON

you O
how O
you O

Martha B-PERSON
, O
leading O
the O

     | O
old O
lady O
to O
the O
bedside O
. O
" O
She O
will O
not O
stay O
, O
because O
you O
are O

well O
enough O

talk O
  O

you O

     | O
will O

will O
you O
not O

" O

  | O
" O
Glad O

said O
the O
miserable O
man O
, O
knitting O
his O
brows O
, O
and O
throwing O
upon O
her O
a O
look O
of O
deep O

     | O
aversion O

" O
Do O

she O
not O
the O
town O

paid O

     | O
Somebody O

the O
poor O

" O

" O
Well O
now O
, O
that O

is O

terrible O

to O
be O
sure O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
Mrs. O
Gabberly B-PERSON
. O
" O
He O
is O
quite O

     | O
shook O
in O
his O
mind O

man O
! O
His O
talking O
about O

me O
feel O

Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
, O
shall O
I O

" O
| 
  | O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
looked O
so O
very O
much O
as O
if O
he O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
take O
her O
up O
in O
his O
enormous O
hand O

     | O
and O
throw O
her O
to O
the O
further O
end O
of O
the O
room O

Martha B-PERSON
thought O
it O
prudent O
to O
prevent O
her O

nearer O
approach O

employed O

listened O
to O
him O

ascertained O
how O

impossible O

Willingly O
would O
the O
still O
brisk O
little O
lady O

crept O
under O

toilet O

table O

or O
the O
bed O

itself O

rather O

glorious O
an O
opportunity O

repeated O

began O
opening O
sundry O
physic O

vials O

stood O
on O
a O
table O
at O
the O
bottom O

smelling O
some O

judgment O

it O
, O
Mrs. O

" O

Perfectly O
well O
disposed O
to O
execute O
the O

quite O
as O
desirous O
as O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
could O

     | O
be O
that O
the O
proud O
poor O
lady O
who O
had O
ever O
treated O
her O

haughty O
coldness O

perform O
her O
errand O

Martha B-PERSON
, O
remembering O

     | O
the O
manner O
in O
which O
she O
had O
left O
her O
step O

mother O
engaged O

stepped O
forward O

prevent O
her O

     | O
quietly O
saying O
, O
" O
If O
my O
father O
wishes O
to O
see O
his O
wife O

I O

I O
really O

you O

permit O

you O
down O
stairs O

your O

donkey O

chair O

at O
the O

time O

I O
am O
sure O
you O
must O
be O
aware O
that O

not O

bear O
seeing O

" O
You O
are O
quite O
right O

my O
dear O
, O
quite O
right O

indeed O
— O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
is O
looking O
sadly O
wild O
and O
|
     | O
feverish O
, O
and O
I O
should O
say O
that O
nobody O
whatever O
but O
the O
doctor O
and O
his O
own O
family O
ought O
to O
see O
|
     | O
him O
. O
Of O
course O
I O
suppose O
it O
would O
not O
be O
very O
convenient O
to O
hire O
attendants O
now O
, O
for O
these O
sort O
|
     | O
of O
people O
, O
I O
am O
sorry O
to O
say O
, O
always O
insist O
upon O
ready O
money O
, O
which O
is O
a O
cruel O
thing O
under O
such O
|
     | O
circumstances O
. O
But O
so O
it O
is O
, O
and O
therefore O
it O
follows O
that O
you O
and O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa I-PERSON
must O
be O
the O

     | O
chief O

" O

" O
Certainly O
, O

it O
will O
be O
his O

will O
wish O

attend O
to O
him O

And O
therefore O
, O

     | O
if O
you O

, O
I O
will O
take O
you O
down O

see O
you O
to O
your O
carriage O
. O
" O

get O
out O
of O
the O
room O

gone O
over O

you O
hear O
me O

more B-CARDINAL

fun O

cried O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
, O
bursting O
into O
a O
shout O
of O

     | O
laughter O

seeing O
that O

every O

down O

| 
  | O
Thankful O
was O
Martha B-PERSON
that O
the O
supposed O
broker O
was O
one O
who O
could O
not O
in O
reality O
add O
to O
the O

     | O
horror O
of O
the O
scene O

She O
turned O
to O
him O
as O

left O

himself O

his O

Martha B-PERSON
entered O
the O
little O

sittingroom O

the O

me O
in O
some O
degree O
in O
the O
eyes O

my O

the O

Indignant O
and O
disgusted O

Martha B-PERSON
felt O
no O
scruple O
in O
employing O
the O
means O

father O
had O
given O

     | O
her O
for O
obtaining O
the O
interview O

desired O

" O
My O

his O
motive O

proceeded O
from O

The O
effect O
of O
these O
words O
was O
as O
sudden O
as O
that O
produced O
by O
the O
magic O
touch O

not O

Martha B-PERSON
attempted O

the O
basket O
was O
too O
heavy O

she O
set O
it O
down O

again O

" O
A O
tolerably O
good O

Then O
applying O

she O
lifted O
her O

one O
great O
reason O

In O
general O
the O
nose O
of O
Lady B-PERSON

greatly O
outblushed O
her O
cheeks O

the O
tip O

high O

her O
long O

chin O

crimson O

the O
remarkable O
length O

her O
throat O

you O

uncontrollable O
rage O

condescending O
to O
hold O

piercing O
voice O

rushed O

door O

wide O

so O
left O
it O

paced O

with O
rapid O

tragic O
strides O

to O
the O

shelter O

the O
sympathy O
of O
Mistress O
Saunderson B-PERSON

It O
was O
, O
perhaps O
, O
because O
the O
door O

open O

that O

knew O
the O
sound O

follow O

     | O
Sir O

into O
the O
most O
violent O
shout O

laughter O

ever O
made O
itself O
heard O
from O

mortal O
lungs O

it O
terrified O
Martha B-PERSON

made O
Michael B-PERSON
Armstrong I-PERSON
shudder O

caused O
Mrs. O

herself O

the O
very O
valuable O
information O

extraordinary O
scene O

enable O

Long O
did O
this O
frightful O
laugh O
continue O

strength O

condition O

It O
would O
be O
perfectly O
monstrous O
, O
and O
every O
body O
would O
|
     | O
call O
me O
a O
brute O
for O
it O
. O
Till O
Dr. O
Crockley B-PERSON
has O
been O
here O
, O
I O
really O
neither O
can O
nor O
will O
go O
. O
I O
am O
|
     | O
quite O
determined O
that O
I O
will O
hear O
what O
he O
says O
about O
him O
. O
" O
|  
  | O
" O
Let O
her O
stay O
, O
" O
said O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
hollow O
whisper O
, O
which O
proved O
that O
he O
was O
neither O
|
     | O
asleep O
nor O
dead O
, O
though O
his O
closed O
eyes O
, O
and O
ghastly O
countenance O
, O
might O
have O
been O
mistaken O
for O
|
     | O
one B-CARDINAL
state O
or O
the O
other O
. O
| 
  | O
Martha B-PERSON
went O
to O
him O
, O
took O
his O
hand O
, O
wiped O
the O
profuse O
perspiration O
from O
his O
brow O
, O
and O
then O
|
     | O
placing O
herself O
in O
a O
chair O
beside O
him O
, O
continued O
to O
watch O
his O
altered O
countenance O
, O
alike O
|
     | O
unmindful O
as O
it O
seemed O
of O
the O
presence O
of O
Mrs. O
Gabberly B-PERSON
, O
or O
that O
of O
Michael B-PERSON
either O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
lady O
, O
perfectly O
contented O
to O
be O
thus O
quietly O
established O
as O
a O
looker O
- O
on O
, O
determined O
, O
for O
|
     | O
the O
present O
, O
neither O
to O
move'nor B-GPE
speak O
, O
lest O
she O
might O
lose O
the O
valued O
privilege O
thereby O
  O
but O
|
     | O
Michael B-PERSON
became O
so O
conscious O
of O
the O
awkwardness O
of O
his O
situation O
, O
and O
so O
fearful O
lest O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
|
     | O
from O
forgetting O
him O
, O
might O
get O
into O
a O
scrape O
likewise O
, O
that O
he O
ventured O
to O
approach O
the O
foot O
of O
|
     | O
the O
bed O
on O
tiptoe O
, O
merely O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
recalling O
himself O
to O
her O
recollection O
, O
and O
then O
, O
|
     | O
on O
seeing O
her O
start O
at O
the O
sight O
of O
him O
, O
he O
said O
in O
a O
whisper O
, O
" O
I O
suppose O
I O
had O
better O
go O
down O
|
     | O
stairs O
now O
, O
Miss O
Martha B-PERSON
? O
" O
| 
  | O
Martha B-PERSON
in O
reply O
to O
this O
nodded O
affirmatively O
, O
and O
in O
the O
same O
low O
tone O
added O
, O
" O
I O
shall O
have O
|
     | O
other O
business O
to O
speak O
to O
you O
about O
. O
Do O
not O
go O
away O
till O
you O
have O
seen O
me O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Michael B-PERSON
's O
eyes O
were O
naturally O
turned O
to O
Martha B-PERSON
while O
this O
passed O
  O
but O
when O
he O
withdrew O
them O
, O
|
     | O
and O
was O
about O
to O
make O
his O
retreat O
, O
he O
caught O
the O
large O
, O
wide O
open O
, O
wild O
- O
looking O
eyes O
of O
Sir O
|
     | O
Matthew B-PERSON
fixed O
earnestly O
upon O
him O
. O
The O
young O
man O
involuntarily O
dropped O
his O
eyelids O
, O
for O
the O
gaze O
|
     | O
was O
a O
frightful O
one O
, O
and O
turned O
to O
leave O
the O
room O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Stay O
! O
" O
roared O
a O
hoarse O
but O
loud O
and O
stunning O
voice O
from O
the O
bed O
. O
" O

" O

   | O
state O
of O
mind O
and O
body O
  O
and O
the O
subsequent O
discovery O
of O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
of O
whose O
visit O

     | O
to O
the O
factory O
he O
had O
heard O
from O
Parsons O
, O
and O
at O
whose O
escape O
he O
expressed O
the O
most O
unbridled O
|
     | O
rage O
, O
accelerated O
symptoms O
which O
had O
before O
threatened O
him O
, O
and O
sent O
such O
a O
rush O
of O
blood O
to O
|
     | O
the O
brain O
as O
instantly O
produced O
apoplexy O
, O
and O
left O
him O
totally O
deprived O
of O
sense O
and O
motion O
. O
|  
  | O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
whose O
eyes O
were O
fixed O
upon O
him O
, O
uttered O
a O
fearful O
shriek O
, O
and O
threw O
herself O
on O
the O
|
     | O
body O
, O
believing O
that O
he O
was O
dead O
. O
But O
Mrs. O
Gabberly B-PERSON
knew O
better O
. O
She O
had O
practised O
too O
long O
as O

     | O
an O
amateur O
not O
to O
know O
a O
fit O
of O
apoplexy O
when O
she O
saw O
it O
, O
and O
promptly O
exclaimed O
, O
" O

away O

off O

you O

, O
if O
we O
could O
but O
bleed O
him O
, O
he O

     | O
would O
open O
his O

again O
fast O
enough O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
With O
the O
rapidity O
of O
lightning O
poor O
Martha B-PERSON
obeyed O
. O
She O
withdrew O
herself O
from O
the O
bed O
, O
|
     | O
endeavoured O
to O
raise O
her O
father O
in O
her O
arms O
, O
and O
, O
by O
the O
help O
of O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
succeeded O
. O
She O
then O
|
     | O
bared O
his O
arm O
, O
bound O
her O
own O
waist O
- O
belt O
tightly O
round O
it O
, O
and O
with O
unshrinking O
courage O
had O
|
     | O
thrust O
a O
sharp O
penknife O
which O
she O
drew O
from O
her O
pocket O
into O
a O
vein O
, O
before O
the O
skillful O
lady O
|
     | O
who O
had O
prescribed O
the O
measure O
had O
half B-CARDINAL
recovered O
her O
astonishment O
on O
perceiving O
that O
the O
poor O
|
     | O
girl O
had O
conceived O
the O
project O
of O
putting O
it O
into O
immediate O
execution O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
old O
adage O
that O
" O
where O
there O
is O
a O
will O
, O
there O
is O
a O
way O
, O
" O
was O
never O
better O
illustrated O
than O
|
     | O
by O
this O
act O
of O
the O
tender O
- O
hearted O
and O
invalided O
Martha B-PERSON
. O
She O
felt O
that O
her O
father O
's O
life O
hung O
on O
|
     | O
the O
promptness O
with O
which O
the O
operation O
was O
performed O
  O
she O
felt O
too O
, O
that O
if O
she O
shrunk O
from O
|
     | O
it O
, O
there O
was O
no O
one O
else O
who O
would O
perform O
it O
, O
and O
totally O
forgetful O
of O
herself O
and O
her O
own O
|
     | O
feelings O
conquered O
the O
rebellious O
weakness O
that O
would O
have O
held O
her O
hand O
, O
and O
did O
what O
two B-TIME
|
     | I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
before O
she O
would O
have O
believed O
it O
utterly O
impossible O
she O
could O
have O
done O
. O
The O
result O
|
     | O
did O
honour O
to O
the O
skill O
of O
Mrs. O
Gabberly B-PERSON
. O
The O
lazy O
current O
flowed O
, O
though O
reluctantly O
. O
Sir O
|
     | O
Matthew B-PERSON
opened O
his O
large O
eyes O
, O
rolled O
them O
from O
side O
to O
side O
, O
heaved O
a O
deep O
and O
heavy O
sigh O
, O
and O
|
     | O
presently O
attempted O
to O
speak O
, O
but O
this O
was O
beyond O
his O
power O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
What O
more O
should O
be O
done O
? O
" O
said O
the O
pale O
, O

now O
trembling O
Martha B-PERSON

turning O
towards O
Mrs. O

" O

now O
, O
my O
dear O

you O
must O
just O
let O
him O
alone O

a O
little O

replied O
the O
physician O
by O

hereditary O
right O

" O
Well O
now O

added O

, O
when O
Dr. O

     | O
entered O
it O
. O
Were O
all O
the O
words O
which O
Mrs. O

then O
uttered O
in O
explanation O
of O

Dr. O

nodded O

and O
|
     | O
applauded O
a O
great O
deal O
, O
joked O
a O
little O
, O
and O
finally O
felt O
the O
patient O

pulse O
, O
observing O
at O
the O

     | O
same O
time O
that O
it O
was O
necessary O
at O
any O
rate O
to O
bring O
him O
round O
sufficiently O
to O
get O
a O
little O

     | O
talk O
on O

out O
of O
him O
, O
before O
he O
popped O
off O
for O
good O
and O
all O
. O

  | O
" O
Very O
right O

proper O
if O
you O

sagaciously O
observed O
Mrs. O

     | O
" O
But O
you O
may O

here O
she O
whispered O
something O
, O
that O
it O
was O
especially O
|
     | O
intended O
Martha B-PERSON
should O
be O
neither O
the O
better O

The O
doctor O
nodded O

winked O
, O

     | O
and O
nodded O
again O
  O
and O
then O
turning O
to O
the O
poor O
girl O
who O
was O
not O
only O
the O
one O
who O
alone O

Dr. O

turned O
to O
her O
, O

with O
|
     | O
very O
little O
of O
even O
the O
external O
decency O
of O
sympathy O
said O

Martha B-PERSON
moved O

not O
conceiving O

Matthew B-PERSON
appears O
to O
be O
in O
a O
very O
dangerous O
state O
, O
Mr. O
Parsons B-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
|
     | O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
sulky O
superintendent O
came O
up O
to O
him O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Perhaps O
your O
right O
honourable O
greatness O
has O
been O
studying O
medicine O
, O
since O
I O
had O
the O
pleasure O
|
     | O
of O
taking O
that O
little O
drive O
with O
you O
into O
Derbyshire B-GPE
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
have O
studied O
many O
things O
since O
that O
time O
, O
Mr. O
Parsons B-PERSON
, O
" O
replied O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
laughing O
  O
" O
and O
|
     | O
one O
is O
the O
nature O
and O
use O
of O
locks O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
The O
tone O
in O
which O
this O
was O
answered O
was O
so O
brutal O
, O
that O
the O
young O
man O
, O
rather O
from O
disgust O
|
     | O
than O
anger O
, O
walked O
on O
faster O
than O
his O
foe O
could O
follow O
him O
  O
and O
reaching O
the O
house O
some B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
|
     | O
before O
him O
, O
made O
his O
way O
again O
without O
ceremony O
— O
for O
it O
was O
no O
time O
for O
it O
— O
into O
the O
|
     | O
apartment O
of O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
. O
A O
considerable O
change O
had O
taken O
place O
in O
the O
condition O
of O
the O
patient O
|
     | O
since O
he O
left O
it O
. O
The O
cataplasms O
had O
so O
far O
succeeded O
as O
to O
restore O
animation O
and O
|
     | O
consciousness O
: O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
, O
still O
surrounded O
by O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
Mrs. O
Gabberly B-PERSON
, O
and O
the O
doctor O
, O
was O
|
     | O
gazing O
upon O
them O
with O
widely O
- O
opened O
eyes O
, O
which O
, O
though O
wild O
and O
wandering O
in O
expression O
, O
were O
|
     | O
evidently O
not O
devoid O
of O
speculation O
. O
Michael B-PERSON
had O
entered O
very O
gently O
, O
but O
not O
without O
being O
|
     | O
heard O
by O
the O
sick O
man O
  O
for O
he O
turned O
his O
eyes O
full O
upon O
him O
as O
he O
approached O
. O
The O
sight O
of O
him O
, O
|
     | O
however O
, O
no O
longer O
seemed O
to O
produce O
any O
emotion O
  O
for O
after O
looking O
quietly O
at O
him O
for O
a O
|
     | O
moment O
, O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
turned O
his O
gaze O
upon O
Mrs. O
Gabberly B-PERSON
, O
who O
from O
being O
in O
the O
act O
of O
leaning O
|
     | O
over O
him O
, O
brought O
herself O
particularly O
within O
his O
sight O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Is B-WORK_OF_ART
Parsons I-WORK_OF_ART
come O
? O
" O
said O
Martha B-PERSON
in O
a O
whisper O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
He O
must O
be O
in O
the O
hall O
by O
this O
time O
, O
" O
replied O
Michael B-PERSON
: O
" O
shall O
I O
tell O
him O
to O
come O
up O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
My O
dear O
father O
has O
not O
yet O
spoken O
, O
" O
she O
said O
  O
" O
but O
, O
perhaps O
, O
he O
may O
understand O
me O
. O
— O
Parsons O
|
     | O
is O
here O
, O
papa O
, O
" O
she O
added O
, O
taking O
her O
father O
's O
hand O
, O
and O
leaning O
over O
him O
— O
" O
should O
you O
like O
to O
|
     | O
see O
him O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
He O
is O
in O
London B-GPE
, O
my O
dear O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
knight O
very O
distinctly O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Thank O
God O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
tenderly O
kissing O
him O
— O
" O
Thank O
God O
! O
His O
speech O
is O
not O
in O
the O
|
     | O
least O
affected O
! O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Rather O
wandering O
, O
though O
, O
" O
said O
Dr. O
Crockley B-PERSON
, O
winking O
his O
eye O
at O
Mrs. O
Gabberly B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
should O
say O
, O
bleed O
him O
again O
, O
if O
you O
want O
to O
get O
any O
thing O
out O
of O
him O
  O
" O
observed O
Mrs. O
|
     | O
Gabberly B-PRODUCT
, O
looking O
sagaciously O
at O
the O
doctor O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Perhaps O
I O
may O
, O
in O
an B-TIME
hour I-TIME
or O
two B-CARDINAL
, O
" O
he O
replied O
, O
applying O
his O
finger O
to O
the O
patient O
's O
|
     | O
pulse O
. O
| 
  | O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
fixed O
his O
eyes O
upon O
him O
, O
and O
laughed O
a O
horrid O
, O
rattling O
, O
ghastly O
sort O
of O
laugh O
, O
|
     | O
that O
seemed O
to O
come O
from O
his O
throat O
. O
" O
You O
have O
n't O
quite O
done O
with O
me O
yet O
, O
have O
you O
, O
Crockley B-PERSON
? O
" O
|
     | O
said O
he O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Done O
with O
you O
, O
my O
dear O
friend O
? O
God O
forbid O
! O
" O
replied O
the O
physician O
, O
rather O
startled O
at O
the O
|
     | O
apparently O
healthy O
state O
of O
his O
patient O
's O
intellect O
, O
and O
affectionately O
smoothing O
his O
pillows O
, O
|
     | O
and O
settling O
the O
bedclothes O
about O
him O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Would O
you O
like O
to O
see O
Parsons B-PERSON
, O
dear O
papa O
? O
" O
said O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
gently O
, O
and O
again O
bending O
over O
|
     | O
him O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Oh O
, O
yes O
! O
" O
he O
replied O
eagerly O
  O
" O
I O
'll O
see O
Parsons O
now O
, O
directly O
— O
I O
should O
be O
very O
sorry O
not O
|
     | O
to O
see O
Parsons O
. O
I O
may O
live O
, O
or O
I O
may O
die O
, O
you O
know O
  O
but O
I O
must O
see O
Parsons O
. O
| 
   | O
give O
, O
with O
as O
little O
disturbance O
to O
him O
as O
possible O
. O
On O
reaching O
the O
hall O
, O
|
     | O
however O
, O
she O
saw O
him O
not O
, O
and O
was O
on O
the O
point O
of O
returning O
up O
stairs O
to O
inquire O
of O
Michael B-PERSON
|
     | O
where O
he O
had O
left O
him O
, O
when O
she O
caught O
the O
sound O
of O
his O
voice O
from O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
's O
study O
. O
On O
|
     | O
entering O
this O
room O
she O
perceived O
not O
only O
Mr. O
Parsons B-PERSON
but O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa I-PERSON
, O
who O
, O
standing O
before O
|
     | O
the O
commode O
in O
which O
, O
as O
she O
happened O
to O
know O
, O
her O
husband O
was O
accustomed O
to O
keep O
papers O
of O
|
     | O
importance O
, O
as O
well O
as O
money O
, O
appeared O
to O
have O
been O
very O
assiduously O
examining O
its O
contents O
  O
|
     | O
for O
every O
recess O
had O
evidently O
been O
visited O
, O
and O
, O
as O
one O
of O
her O
hands O
was O
tightly O
clutched O
over O
|
     | O
a O
pocket O
- O
book O
, O
it O
seemed O
that O
her O
researches O
had O
not O
been O
wholly O
in O
vain O
, O
and O
that O
she O
had O
not O
|
     | O
privately O
obtained O
possession O
of O
his O
keys O
for O
nothing O
. O
|  
  | O
" O
I O
was O
sent O
for O
, O
my O
lady O
, O
" O
said O
Parsons O
, O
apparently O
replying O
to O
some O
question O
of O
her O
|
     | O
ladyship O
's O
, O
which O
, O
to O
judge O
by O
her O
angry O
frown O
, O
and O
the O
vexed O
expression O
of O
her O
countenance O
, O
|
     | O
had O
not O
been O
a O
civil O
one O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
My O
father O
wishes O
to O
see O
Mr. O
Parsons B-PERSON
directly O
, O
" O
said O
Martha B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
" O
And O
by O
your O
ladyship O
's O
leave O
I O
must O
take O
that O
green O
pocket O
- O
book O
with O
me O
, O
" O
said O
Parsons O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
What O
pocket O
- O
book O
, O
you O
rude O
fellow O
? O
" O
replied O
Lady O
Clarissa B-PERSON
, O
indignantly O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
That O
one O
as O
your O
ladyship O
now O
holds O
in O
your O
left O
hand O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
confidential O
|
     | O
superintendent O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
I O
wonder O
, O
sirrah O
, O
that O
you O
do O
not O
ask O
me O
to O
give O
you O
the O
rings O
off O
my O
fingers O
! O
" O
cried O
the O
|
     | O
angry O
mistress O
of O
the O
mansion O
. O
" O
Go O
to O
your O
master O
, O
fellow O
, O
if O
he O
has O
sent O
for O
you O
, O
and O
I O
shall O
|
     | O
go O
too O
. O
So O
you O
need O
not O
trouble O
yourself O
about O
the O
pocket O
- O
book O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
And O
with O
these O
words O
she O
pushed O
past O
both O
Martha B-PERSON
and O
Mr. O
Parsons B-PERSON
, O
preceding O
them O
to O
the O
sick O
|
     | O
man O
's O
chamber O
. O
By O
the O
time O
they O
entered O
it O
his O
eyes O
were O
again O
closed O
, O
but O
he O
appeared O
to O
|
     | O
breathe O
without O
difficulty O
, O
though O
rather O
more O
audibly O
than O
usual O
, O
and O
Martha B-PERSON
fancied O
that O
he O
|
     | O
was O
asleep O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Hush O
! O
" O
said O
she O
. O
" O
Do O
not O
disturb O
him O

He O
is O
sleeping O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Dr. O
Crockley B-PERSON
and O
Mrs. O
Gabberly B-PERSON
had O
withdrawn O
to O
a O
window O
, O
and O
were O
evidently O
in O
consultation O
  O
|
     | O
but O
whether O
on O
the O
symptoms O
of O
apoplexy O
, O
or O
bankruptcy O
, O
might O
be O
doubtful O
. O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
however O
, O
|
     | O
was O
standing O
close O
beside O
the O
bed O
, O
and O
in O
answer O
to O
Martha B-PERSON
's O
observation O
shook O
his O
head O
, O
|
     | O
saying O
, O
" O
No O
! O
not O
asleep O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
" O
Then O
he O
'll O
manage O
to O
hear O
what O
I O
've O
got O
to O
say O
to O
him O
, O
" O
said O
Parsons O
, O
advancing O
, O
and O
|
     | O
throwing O
a O
glance O
of O
spiteful O
vengeance O
at O
Lady O
Clarissa B-PERSON
, O
" O
because O
it O
is O
just O
what O
he O
wants O
to O

     | O
know O

" O
| 
  | O
At O
the O
sound O
of O
Parsons O
's O
voice O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
opened O
his O
eyes O
, O
and O
made O
an O
effort O
to O
raise O
|
     | O
himself O
, O
but O
this O
was O
beyond O
his O
power O
, O
and O
it O
was O
only O
by O
being O
lifted O
with O
as O
little O
effort O
|
     | O
as O
possible O
on O
his O
own O
part O
, O
as O
if O
he O
were O
already O
dead O
, O
that O
he O
was O
placed O
in O
the O
attitude O
he O
|
     | O
seemed O
to O
desire O
, O
and O
in O
which O
he O
was O
supported O
by O
pillows O
, O
and O
by O
the O
arms O
of O
poor O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
who O
|
     | O
had O
placed O
herself O
on O
the O
bolster O
behind O
him O
. O
| 
  | O
It O
was O
a O
frightful O
and O
awful O
expression O
which O
then O
took O
possession O
of O
his O
sunken O
features O
, O
|
     | O
nevertheless O
a O
hateful O
sort O
of O
smile O
made O
part O
of O
it O
. O

" O

his O

" O

my O
bidding O

demanded O
the O
knight O
, O
with O
a O
sort O
of O
gasping O
which O
seemed O

     | O
to O
threaten O

breath O

about O

her O

" O
Yes O
, O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
, O
" O
replied O
Parsons O
, O
with O
something O
like O
a O
titter O

" O
Then O

panted O
the O
dying O

let O
her O

know O
what O

I O
gave O
you O
instructions O

" O
A O
very O
fitting O
business O
for O
an O
honourable O
gentleman O
to O
attend O
to O
, O
when O
his O
affairs O
are O
in O

     | O
confusion O
, O
and O
he O
not O
in O
an O

state O
of O
health O

replied O
the O
confidential O
servant O
, O

     | O
turning O
himself O
round O
, O
so O
as O
exactly O
to O
face O
her O
ladyship O

" O
No O

matter O

three B-MONEY

" O

  | O
Now O
three B-QUANTITY
thousand I-QUANTITY
pounds I-QUANTITY
a O
year O
was O
exactly O
the O
sum O
, O
for O
the O
settlement O

which O
upon O

     | O
herself O
, O
a O
daughter O
of O
the O
noble O

Dowling B-PERSON
, O
and O
the O
mention O
of O
the O
often O

meditated O
sum O
roused O
her O
ladyship O

attention O
so O

     | O
effectually O
that O
her O
face O
involuntarily O
protruded O
itself O
beyond O
her O
body O
, O
till O
her O
nose O
very O

     | O
nearly O
reached O
that O
of O
the O

who O
was O
addressing O
her O

" O

Sir O

positively O

his O
chin O

" O

Parsons O

leering O
aside O
at O
Dr. O
Crockley B-PERSON

with O
Mrs. O

drawn O

disclosure O

him O
die O
when O
he O

, O
wo O
n't O
have O
it O
upon O
his O
conscience O
that O
he O
defrauded O
his O

to O
make O
a O
settlement O
upon O
any O
lady O
in O
the O
land O
, O
gentle O

simple O
  O
because O
you O
see O
he O

     | O
has O
left O
proof O
, O
plain O

clear O

that O
he O

committed O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
act O
of O
bankruptcy O
before O

     | O
he O
made O
the O
settlement O

for O
that O
good O

excellent O

will O
have O
no O

one B-MONEY

from O

in O
a O
voice O

ghastly O
laughter O

Parsons O

  | O
With O
a O
look O
of O
inexpressible O
rage O
, O
Lady O
Clarissa B-PERSON
turned O
away O
from O
him O

made O
towards O
the O

     | O
door O

  | O
" O
Stop O

Crockley B-PERSON

Sir O

feebly O

| 
  | O
Dr. O
Crockley B-PERSON
had O
a O
great O
respect O
for O
the O
peerage O

would O
, O
beyond O
all O
question O
, O
have O

     | O
preferred O
snatching O
a O
pocket O

book O

nine B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL

ninety I-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
nine I-CARDINAL
untitled O
ladies O

     | O
succession O
, O
rather O
than O
from O
one B-CARDINAL
Lady O
Clarissa B-PERSON
  O
but O
he O
felt O
that O
this O
was O
no O
moment O
for O

     | O
ceremony O
, O
and O
obeying O
what O
was O
very O
likely O
to O
be O
the O
last O
behest O
of O
his O
patron O
, O
he O
rolled O
his O

     | O
fat O
person O
after O
her O

extraordinary O
muscular O
exertion O

grasping O
the O
lady O

robe O

     | O
one O
hand O
, O
seized O
on O
her O
rigidly O
clenched O
fist O

the O
other O

in O
such O
a O
sort O
, O
that O
, O
according O

     | O
to O
the O
prophecy O
of O
Mr. O
Parsons B-PERSON
, O
the O
green O
pocket O

book O
dropped O
out O
of O
it O

  | O
Unfortunately O
, O
however O
, O
the O
attitude O
in O
which O
this O
feat O
was O
performed O
, O
was O
one O
which O
could O

the O
ill O

balanced O
person O

the O
supporting O
form O
of O
the O
lady O

on O
whom O
he O

thrown O
himself O

escaped O
from O

, O
struggling O
with O

much O

well O

upon O

pocket O

, O
he O
measured O
his O
length O
upon O
the O

     | O
ground O

| 
  | O
Parsons O
, O
though O
certainly O
not O
hoping O
for O
so O
lucky O
an O
accident O
, O
had O
, O
with O
the O
same O
sort O
of O
|
     | O
instinct O
which O
brings O
the O
crow O
beside O
a O
sickly O
sheep O
, O
followed O
closely O
the O
retreating O
steps O
of O

     | O
her O
ladyship O
, O
and O
adroitly O
jerking O
the O
coveted O
pocket O
- O
book O
with O
his O
foot O
, O
so O
that O
it O
should O

     | O
escape O
the O
being O
buried O
under O
the O
stumbling O
physician O
, O
prepared O
himself O
to O
dip O
and O
catch O
it O
. O
|
     | O
But O
the O
success O
of O
the O
manoeuvre O
was O
less O
perfect O
than O
its O
ingenuity O
deserved O
  O
for O
ere O
his O
tall O
|
     | O
rigid O
person O
had O
bent O
itself O
sufficiently O
for O
him O
to O
reach O
the O
ground O
, O
Mrs. O
Gabberly B-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
|
     | O
become O
one O
of O
the O
group O
at O
the O
same O
instant O
with O
Dr. O
Crockley B-PERSON
, O
was O
in O
possession O
of O
it O
, O
and O
ere O
|
     | O
the O
prostrate O
Crockley B-GPE
or O
the O
stooping O
Parsons O
could O
raise O
their O
eyes O
, O
the O
prize O
had O
dropped O
|
     | O
into O
the O
deepest O
recesses O
of O
a O
prodigious O
pocket O
, O
which O
reached O
nearly O
to O
the O
bottom O
of O
her O
|
     | O
little O
petticoat O
. O
| 
   | O
was O
placed O
a O
|  | O
flacon O
|  | O
of O
Cologne B-GPE
water O
, O
which O
poor O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
almost O
|
     | O
exhausted O
by O
the O
painful O
attitude O
necessary O
to O
sustain O
the O
pillows O
, O
had O
made O
him O
a O
sign O
to O
get O
|
     | O
for O
her O
. O
This O
movement O
brought O
him O
within O
the O
range O
of O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
's O
eyes O
, O
and O
something O
in O
his O
|
     | O
aspect O
as O
he O
cautiously O
bent O
to O
take O
the O
bottle O
, O
or O
else O
the O
thick O
- O
coming O
fancies O
of O
a O
brain O
|
     | O
diseased O
, O
though O
not O
paralyzed O
, O
suddenly O
produced O
a O
terrible O
effect O
upon O
the O
dying O
man O
, O
and O
he O
|
     | O
uttered O
a O
cry O
so O
harsh O
and O
terrible O
as O
to O
constrain O
the O
attention O
even O
of O
the O
preoccupied O
group O
|
     | O
at O
the O
door O
. O
|  
  | O
" O
There O
's O
a O
dead O
body O
walking O
about O
the O
room O
! O
" O
he O
ejaculated O
in O
an O
unnatural O
and O
frightful O
|
     | O
accent O
. O
" O
He O
is O
come O
for O
me O
! O
and O
I O
must O
go O
! O
" O
The O
shriek O
which O
followed O
these O
words O
was O
terrible O
. O
|
     | O
In O
a O
minute O
or O
two B-CARDINAL
he O
spoke O
again O
, O
but O
almost O
in O
a O
whisper O
. O
" O
One B-CARDINAL
? O
No O
! O
— O
it O
is O
not O
one O
, O
it O
is O
|
     | O
five B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
! O
Take O
them O
! O
— O
take O
them O
away O
from O
me O
, O
I O
tell O
you O
! O
They O
are O
all O
dirty O
, O
beastly O

     | O
factory O
- O
children O
. O
Their O
arms O
and O
legs O
are O
all O
broken O
and O
smashed O
, O
and O
hanging O
by O
bits O
of O
skin O
. O

     | O
Take O
them O
away O
, O
I O
tell O
you O

Their O
horrid O
joints O

dangling O

and O
loose O

tell O
you O

" O
and O
then O
again O
he O
shouted O
with O
so O
fearful O
a O
cry O
, O
that O
even O
Parsons O
|
     | O
pressed O
his O
hands O
upon O
his O
ears O
to O
save O
them O
from O
the O
sound O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Calm O
him O
! O
calm O
him O
! O
" O
cried O
the O
trembling O
Martha B-PERSON
. O
" O
Can O
you O

give O
him O
something O

the O

drily O

" O

again O

cried O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
bending O
forward O
till O
her O
cheek O
touched O
that O
of O
her O

     | O
father O

" O
Compose O
yourself O

" O
| 
  | O
Her O
tender O
caresses O
, O
and O
her O
gentle O
voice O
together O
, O
seemed O
to O
reach O
, O
and O
quiet O
for O
a O
moment O
|
     | O
his O
wandering O
intellect O
. O
He O
made O
an O
effort O
to O
turn O
his O
head O
towards O
her O
, O
but O
that O
was O
|
     | O
impossible O
  O
and O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
, O
upon O
his O
first B-ORDINAL
frightful O
cry O
, O
removed O
himself O
to O
the O
head O
of O
|
     | O
the O
bed O
, O
where O
the O
eye O
of O
the O
wretched O
man O
could O
not O
reach O
, O
silently O
offered O
to O
take O
Martha B-PERSON
's O
|
     | O
place O
, O
that O
she O
might O
station O
herself O
where O
it O
could O
. O
She O
quickly O
understood O
him O
, O
and O
in O
a O
|
     | O
moment O
stood O
where O
that O
dying O
eye O
could O
gaze O
upon O
her O
. O
His O
hand O
, O
with O
its O
glittering O
ring O
, O
|
     | O
still O
lay O
upon O
the O
bed O
  O
she O
took O
it O
in O
hers O
, O
and O
fondly O
chafed O
and O
kissed O
it O
. O
But O
it O
was O
stiff O
|
     | O
and O
cold O
as O
marble O
! O
| 
   | O
But O
it O
was O
too O
late O
  O
his O
lips O
never O
opened O
more O
. O
For O
some B-TIME
hours I-TIME
longer O
he O
|
     | O
continued O
to O
breathe O
, O
but O
, O
on O
again O
feeling O
his O
pulse O
, O
Dr. O
Crockley B-PERSON
declared O
that O
its O
faint O
|
     | O
pulsations O
must O
inevitably O
cease O
before O
night B-TIME
. O
|  
  | O
" O
I O
suppose O
your O
old O
servant O
Betty B-PERSON
Parker I-PERSON

still O
in O
the O
house O
, O
Miss O
Martha B-PERSON

" O
said O
he O
. O
The O
|
     | O
poor O
girl O
bowed O
an O
affirmative O
, O
but O
had O
no O
power O
to O
speak O
. O
| 
  | O
" O
Well O
, O
then O
, O
" O
said O
the O
doctor O
, O
" O
I O
should O
recommend O
that O
you O
should O
put O
her O

     | O
no O
good O
for O
any O

us O

stay O
any O
longer O
, O
for O
it O
's O
all O
over O
just O
as O
much O
as O
if O
he O
was O
already O
|
     | O
in O
his O
coffin O
. O
You O
had O
better O
go O
away O
, O
and O
see O
what O
you O
can O
pack O
up O
to O
get O
off O
with O
, O
Miss O

     | O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
that O
's O
all O
that O
is O
left O
to O
be O
done O
, O
as O
far O
as O
I O
can O

Come O
, O
Mrs. O
Gabberly B-PERSON
, O
" O
he O
|
     | O
added O
, O
" O
I O
have O
got O
a O
friendly O
word O
or O
two B-CARDINAL

say O
to O
you O

so O
your O
boy O

mount O
my O

     | O
I O
'll O
drive O
your O
donkey O
for O
you O

" O
And O
so O
saying O
, O
he O
took O
the O
little O
woman O
under O
his O
arm O
and O
|
     | O
trudged O
off O
, O
without O
waiting O
for O
her O
to O
inform O
him O
whether O
she O
approved O
his O
proposal O
, O

not O

     | O
Mr. O
Parsons B-PERSON
, O
giving O
one O
scowling O
look O
at O
the O
silent O
bed O
, O
followed O
them O
, O
and O
Martha B-PERSON
and O
Michael B-PERSON

     | O
were O
left O
together O
beside O
the O
dying O
man O
. O
| 
  | O
Upon O
perceiving O
the O
totally O
unconscious O
state O
into O
which O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
had O
fallen O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
had O
|
     | O
gently O
withdrawn O
himself O
from O
behind O
his O
pillows O
, O
and O
now O
stood O
, O
almost O
as O
silent O
and O
|
     | O
motionless O
as O
himself O
, O
beside O
the O
bed O
, O
respectfully O
waiting O
to O
receive O
from O
the O
desolate O
and O
|
     | O
weeping O
martha B-PERSON
some O
hint O
or O
instruction O
respecting O
his O
staying O
where O
he O
was O
, O
or O
leaving O
her O
. O
|
     | O
Never O
, O
when O
the O
poor O
dependant O
of O
her O
family O
, O
had O
the O
young O
heart O
of O
Michael B-PERSON
been O
impressed O
|
     | O
with O
a O
feeling O
of O
respect O
so O
profound O
as O
he O
at O
that O
moment O
felt O
for O
the O
unhappy O
girl O
. O
In O
truth O
|
     | O
the O
feeling O
was O
so O
powerful O
as O
to O
interfere O
with O
his O
usefulness O
, O
for O
he O
shrank O
from O
appearing O
|
     | O
to O
put O
himself O
forward O
too O
presumptuously O
by O
giving O
her O
advice O
, O
or O
venturing O
in O
any O
degree O
to O
|
     | O
dictate O
what O
it O
might O
be O
best O
for O
her O
to O
do O
. O
But O
when O
, O
after O
remaining O
thus O
bashfully O
silent O
|
     | O
for O
a B-DATE
quarter I-DATE
of I-DATE
an I-DATE
hour I-DATE
, O
he O
perceived O
that O
she O
gave O
no O
other O
sign O
of O
life O
than O
by O
tears O
that O
|
     | O
flowed O
incessantly O
, O
and O
sighs O
that O
seemed O
to O
heave O
her O
breast O
" O
almost O
to O
bursting O
, O
" O
— O
when O
he O
|
     | O
saw O
this O
, O
he O
began O
to O
think O
that O
some O
degree O
of O
seeming O
presumption O
on O
his O
part O
might O
be O
better O
|
     | O
and O
more O
profitable O
for O
her O
, O
whom O
he O
would O
really O
have O
died O
to O
serve O
, O
than O
the O
continuance O
of O
a O
|
     | O
degree O
of O
deference O
, O
which O
must O
render O
him O
useless O
. O
Approaching O
, O
therefore O
, O
to O
the O
chair O
on O
|
     | O
which O
she O
had O
thrown O
herself O
, O
he O
ventured O
to O
say O
, O
" O
Miss O
Martha B-PERSON
! O
where O
can O
I O
find O
your O
old O
|
     | O
servant O
Betty B-PERSON
Parker I-PERSON
? O
I O
remember O
her O
very O
well O
— O
she O
used O
to O
be O
always O
in O
the O
nursery O
. O
If O
you O

     | O
would O
tell O
me O
where O
she O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
, O
I O
will O
go O
for O
her O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Poor O
Martha O
for O
a O
moment O
ceased O
to O
weep O
, O
and O
looked O
up O
at O
him O
. O
" O
Michael B-PERSON
Armstrong I-PERSON
! O
" O
she O
|
     | O
replied O
, O
" O
I O
am O
not O
conscious O
of O
ever O
having O
injured O
any O
human O
being O

yourself O
  O

yet O
you O

are O
the O
only O
one O
who O
is O
near O

this B-TIME

you O

your O
kindness O

my O
good O
boy O

not O
go O
away O

Michael B-PERSON

that O

do O
not O
leave O
the O
house O

all O
is O
over O

you O
may O

useful O

me O

" O
Miss O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
" O
he O
returned O
, O
" O
will O
you O
trust O
me O
to O
sit O
here O

you O
yourself O

whomever O
you O
may O
wish O

out O

here O

     | O
stopped O

" O
His O
eyes O

never O
open O
more O

she O
replied O
, O
while O
the O
tears O
again O
burst O
forth O
, O

     | O
" O
and O
thank O
God O
their O
last O
look O
at O
me O

gentle O
! O
But O
I O
almost O
fear O
to O
leave O
the O
room O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
— O
|
     | O
I O
would O
not O
that O

should O
breathe O
his O
last O
, O

I O
not O
by O
him O

" O
But O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
unskilful O
as O
he O
|
     | O
was O
, O
felt O
that O
the O
scene O
was O
too O
awful O
a O
one O
for O
the O
poor O
girl O
to O
be O
left O
alone O
in O
, O
and O
he O
|
     | O
therefore O
persisted O
to O
declare O
with O
the O
authority O
which O
such O
subduing O
sorrow O
gives O
to O
all O
|
     | O
around O
who O
will O
take O
the O
trouble O
to O
exercise O
it O
, O
that O
he O
would O
watch O
by O
the O
bedside O
of O
her O
|
     | O
father O
while O
she O
sought O
the O
old O
woman O
mentioned O
by O
Dr. O
Crockley B-PERSON
. O
| 
  | O
Reluctantly O
, O
and O
unresistingly O
she O
consented O
, O
and O
giving O
a O
look O
at O
the O
bed O
that O
seemed O
to O
|
     | O
wring O
her O
very O
heart O
, O
she O
quitted O
the O
room O
, O
leaving O
Michael B-PERSON
Armstrong I-PERSON
alone O
with O
the O
motionless O
|
     | O
mass O
of O
still O
living O
clay O
, O
before O
which O
he O
had O
so O
often O
trembled O
. O
| 
  | O
How O
strangely O
eventful O
had O
been O
the O
interval O
between O
those O
well O
- O
remembered O
days O
, O
and O
the O
one O

     | O
actually O
present O
with O
him O
! O
How O
extraordinary O
the O
change O
in O
the O
circumstances O
of O
both O
parties O
! O
|
     | O
It O
was O
not O
triumph O
, O
but O
it O
was O
thankfulness O
, O
which O
Michael B-PERSON
felt O
, O
as O
the O
sense O
of O
this O
came O
|
     | O
fully O
upon O
him O
during O
these O
moments O
of O
profound O
stillness O
  O
and O
the O
result O
of O
all O
the O
moving O
|
     | O
thoughts O
that O
crowded O
upon O
his O
mind O
was O
an O
earnest O
prayer O
to O
Heaven O
that O
he O
might O
never O
be O

     | O
placed O
in O
any O
circumstances O
likely O
to O
harden O
his O
heart O
, O
and O
make O
him O
the O
cause O
of O
suffering O
to O
|
     | O
others O
, O
— O
a O
fearful O
and O
a O
dreadful O
crime O
, O
which O
he O
felt O
, O
as O
he O
gazed O
with O
trembling O
awe O
on O
the O
|
     | O
sunken O
features O
of O
the O
living O
corse O
before O
him O
, O
must O
in O
the O
sight O
of O
God O
be O
held O
as O
one O
of O
the O
|
     | O
most O
daring O
rebellion O
to O
his O
heavenly O
will O
of O
which O
man O
is O
capable O
. O
| 
   | O
Betty B-PERSON
Parker I-PERSON
knew O
little O
of O
the O
intensity O
of O
Martha B-PERSON
's O
pertinacious O
love O
for O
her O
|
     | O
unworthy O
parent O
, O
if O
she O
fancied O
that O
her O
very O
reasonable O
remonstrance O
would O
produce O
any O
effect O
. O
|
     | O
Martha B-PERSON
attempted O
not O
even O
to O
answer O
it O
, O
but O
placing O
herself O
in O
a O
chair O
close O
beside O
the O
bed O
, O
|
     | O
remained O
nearly O
as O
motionless O
as O
the O
faintly O
breathing O
figure O
that O
lay O
upon O
it O
. O
|  
  | O
Poor O
Michael B-PERSON
knew O
not O
too O
well O
what O
he O
ought O
to O
do O
next O
. O
He O
felt O
that O
he O
was O
useless O
there O
  O
|
     | O
he O
knew O
that O
he O
should O
be O
stared O
at O
, O
as O
a O
very O
incomprehensible O
intruder O
, O
if O
he O
descended O
to O
|
     | O
the O
offices O
. O
Yet O
he O
remembered O
that O
his O
benefactress O
had O
bid O
him O
not O
to O
go O
, O
and O
he O
could O
not O
|
     | O
have O
felt O
himself O
more O
strongly O
bound O
to O
remain O
, O
had O
the O
crime O
of O
high O
treason O
been O
involved O
in O
|
     | O
his O
departure O
. O
Yet O
there O
was O
something O
in O
the O
stupid O
puzzled O
look O
with O
which O
Betty B-PERSON
Parker I-PERSON

     | O
regarded O
him O
, O
that O
vexed O
his O
spirit O
. O
He O
was O
conscious O
that O
he O
had O
no O
business O
in O
that O
room O
, O
and O
|
     | O
therefore O
at O
such O
a O
moment O
he O
ought O
not O
to O
be O
there O
. O
After O
a O
few O
moments O
of O
reflection O
he O
|
     | O
approached O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
and O
making O
so O
profound O
a O
reverence O
as O
to O
convince O
Betty B-PERSON
, O
that O
let O
him O
be O
who O
|
     | O
he O
would O
, O
he O
was O
a O
very O
well O
- O
behaved O
young O
gentleman O
, O
he O
said O
, O
" O
I O
will O
now O
, O
Miss O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
go O
to O

     | O
the O

an B-TIME
hour I-TIME
or O
two B-CARDINAL
, O
and O
then O
return O
to O
take O
your O
orders O
. O
" O
A O
look O
of O
gratitude O
was O
all O
|
     | O
her O
reply O
, O
and O
Michael B-PERSON
departed O
. O
| 
  | O
It O
was O
three B-TIME
o'clock I-TIME
in O
the O
afternoon O
when O
he O
entered O
the O
little O
inn O
, O
where O
the O
postboy B-ORG
, O
who O
|
     | O
had O
driven O
him O
from O
Fairly O
in O
the B-TIME
morning I-TIME
, O
was O
still O
waiting O
his O
orders O
. O
" O
I O
can O
not O
tell O
you O

     | O
yet O
, O
my O
lad O
, O
when O
I O
shall O
be O
ready O
to O
return O
, O
" O
he O
replied O
, O
in O
answer O
to O
the O
boy O
's O

     | O
questionings O
. O

  | O
" O
It O

all O

said O
the O
driver O

" O
In O

paid O
accordingly O

" O

" O
Certainly O
you O

" O
returned O
Michael B-PERSON
: O
and O
he O
was O
then O
left O
to O
eat O
his O
solitary O
dinner O
with O
|
     | O
what O
appetite O
he O
might O
. O
| 
  | O
For O
three B-TIME
long I-TIME
melancholy I-TIME
hours I-TIME
he O
employed O
himself O
in O
pacing O
backwards O
and O
forwards O
on O
the O
|
     | O
high O
- O
road O
before O
the O
little O
inn O
, O
and O
was O
beginning O
to O
think O
that O
time O
enough O
had O
elapsed O
to O
|
     | O
justify O
his O
returning O
to O
inquire O
how O
matters O
were O
going O
on O
at O
Dowling B-FAC
Lodge I-FAC
, O
when O
the O
sound O
of O
|
     | O
a O
carriage O
approaching O
as O
it O
seemed O
from O
the O
park O
- O
gates O
, O
cause O
him O
to O
stop O
abruptly O
to O
listen O
, O

     | O
and O
to O
look O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
equipage O
that O
drew O
near O
was O
a O
handsome O
travelling O
- O
carriage O
, O
though O
its O
appearance O
was O
|
     | O
considerably O
disfigured O
by O
the O
prodigious O
quantity O
of O
luggage O
, O
which O
was O
fastened O
by O
ropes O
and O
|
     | O
chains O
to O
every O
part O
of O
it O
. O
The O
imperial O
only O
formed O
the O
foundation O
for O
a O
pyramid O
of O
trunks O
and O
|
     | O
bandboxes O
, O
which O
were O
piled O
upon O
it O
. O
The O
servant's O
- O
seat O
behind O
was O
loaded O
to O
its O
very O
utmost O
|
     | O
capacity O
with O
more O
trunks O
and O
bandboxes O
, O
while O
, O
chained O
below O
it O
, O
was O
a O
massive O
coffer O
, O
that O
|
     | O
looked O
very O
like O
a O
plate O
- O
chest O
, O
having O
suspended O
round O
its O
sides O
, O
bundles O
, O
baskets O
, O
and O
bags O

     | O
innumerable O
. O
Nor O
was O
the O
interior O
by O
any O
means O
reserved O
for O
live O
lumber O
alone O
, O
for O
although O
the O

     | O
rigid O
figures O
of O
Lady O
Clarissa B-PERSON
Dowling I-PERSON
, O
and O
her O
waiting O
- O
woman O
, O
Saunderson B-PERSON
, O
were O
visible O
in O
the O
|
     | O
midst O
, O
it O
appeared O
to O
be O
crammed O
with O
every O
imaginable O
species O
of O
property O
which O
such O
a O
|
     | O
conveyance O
could O
transport O
. O
| 
  | O
Michael B-PERSON
watched O
the O
overloaded O
vehicle O
roll O
by O
with O
great O
satisfaction O
. O
" O
Whatever O
happens O
, O
" O
|
     | O
thought O
he O
, O
" O
Miss O
Martha B-PERSON
must O
be O
better O
without O
her O
. O
" O
Relieved O
by O
knowing O
that O
he O
should O
not O
|
     | O
again O
run O
the O
risk O
of O
encountering O
her O
delectable O
ladyship O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
immediately O
took O
his O
way O
to O
|
     | O
the O
magnificent O
mansion O
she O
had O
forsaken O
, O
and O
perceiving O
that O
the O
hall O
- O
doors O
stood O
wide O
open O
, O
|
     | O
preferred O
passing O
through O
them O
to O
encountering O
again O
the O
motley O
throng O
that O
had O
taken O
|
     | O
possession O
of O
the O
offices O
. O
But O
instead O
of O
finding O
this O
portion O
of O
the O
house O
as O
quiet O
and O
|
     | O
forsaken O
as O
he O
had O
left O
it O
, O
he O
was O
startled O
by O
hearing O
, O
as O
he O
mounted O
the O
steps O
of O
the O
stately O
|
     | O
portico O
, O
a O
multitude O
of O
voices O
in O
violent O
altercation O
. O
| 
  | O
At O
first B-ORDINAL
he O
felt O
disposed O
to O
turn O
away O
and O
seek O
another O
entrance O
, O
but O
the O
vehemence O
of O
the O
|
     | O
sounds O
he O
heard O
excited O
his O
curiosity O
, O
and O
he O
went O
on O
. O
Instead O
of O
one B-CARDINAL
, O
half O
- O
a O
- O
dozen O
strangers O
|
     | O
might O
have O
entered O
without O
running O
any O
risk O
of O
having O
their O
right O
there O
challenged O
  O
so O
great O
|
     | O
was O
the O
confusion O
that O
reigned O
  O
and O
Michael B-PERSON
might O
have O
passed O
up O
the O
great O
stairs O
, O
and O
into O
the O
|
     | O
chamber O
which O
it O
was O
his O
purpose O
to O
visit O
, O
without O
any O
difficulty O
. O
But O
he O
was O
prevented O
from O
|
     | O
taking O
immediate O
advantage O
of O
this O
, O
by O
hearing O
words O
which O
excited O
new O
fears O
for O
the O
|
     | O
unfortunate O
Martha B-PERSON
  O
and O
, O
ere O
he O
had O
listened O
many B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
, O
he O
became O
aware O
that O
a O
new O
creditor O
|
     | O
had O
reached O
the O
lodge O
after O
he O
left O
it O
, O
who O
had O
come O
, O
armed O
with O
proper O
authority O
, O
to O
arrest O
|
     | O
the O
knight O
, O
dead O
or O
alive O
. O
Nor O
did O
the O
discussion O
of O
this O
event O
cause O
all O
the O
uproar O
  O
for O
the O
|
     | O
agents O
of O
the O
parties O
who O
had O
previously O
sent O
in O
the O
execution O
were O
threatening O
with O
all O
sorts O
|
     | O
of O
punishment O
, O
several O
of O
the O
servants O
, O
whom O
they O
accused O
of O
having O
been O
bribed O
to O
assist O
Lady B-PERSON

     | O
Clarissa B-PERSON
in O
the O
removal O
of O
many O
valuables O
which O
she O
had O
no O
right O
to O
take O
. O
It O
was O
not O
this O
part O

     | O
of O
the O
tumult O
, O
however O
, O
that O
interested O
him O
  O
and O
, O
having O
obtained O
but O
too O
clearly O
the O
|
     | O
information O
that O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
was O
arrested O
, O
he O
once O
more O
sought O
for O
the O
unhappy O
Martha B-PERSON
in O
the O
|
     | O
dismal O
chamber O
where O
he O
had O
left O
her O
. O
And O
there O
he O
found O
her O
  O
but O
with O
such O
frightful O
adjuncts O
|
     | O
to O
her O
natural O
grief O
, O
that O
the O
state O
of O
quiet O
decent O
sorrow O
in O
which O
he O
had O
left O
her O
, O
seemed O
a O
|
     | O
condition O
positively O
enviable O
compared O
to O
that O
in O
which O
he O
found O
her O
now O
. O
| 
  | O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
had O
breathed O
his O
last O
, O
and O
the O
corpse O
was O
already O
arranged O
with O
decency O
upon O
its O
|
     | O
stately O
bed O
  O
but O
, O
on O
each O
side O
of O
it O
stood O
an O
officer O
, O
whose O
duty O
it O
was O
to O
violate O
by O
their O
|
     | O
presence O
the O
solemn O
sanctity O
of O
that O
dismal O
chamber O
, O
and O
to O
prevent O
the O
body O
's O
being O
carried O
to O
|
     | O
the O
grave O
, O
till O
the O
claims O
of O
their O
employer O
were O
satisfied O
. O
In O
front O
of O
her O
father O
's O
corpse O
, O

     | O
with O
her O
troubled O
eyes O
( O
no O
longer O
bathed O
in O
the O
healing O
dew O
of O
natural O
sorrow O
) O
, O
turning O
from O
it O
|
     | O
to O
its O
rude O
guardians O
, O
and O
back O
again O
to O
all O
that O
was O
left O
of O
the O
sinful O
being O

had O
so O

     | O
fondly O
, O
blindly O
loved O
, O
— O
stood O
the O
wretched O
daughter O
, O
so O
sad O
a O
spectacle O
of O
woe O
, O
that O
it O
was O
|
     | O
evident O
the O
men O
themselves O
turned O
their O
hard O
eyes O
studiously O
away O
, O
because O
they O
felt O
a O
pang O
of O

     | O
pity O
as O
they O
looked O
upon O
her O
. O

   | O
away O
, O
you O
must O
indeed O
. O
" O
The O
only O
answer O
that O
poor O
Martha B-PERSON
gave O
, O
was O
forcibly O
|
     | O
shaking O
off O
the O
hand O
that O
held O
her O
, O
and O
then O
pointing O
, O
first B-ORDINAL
to O
her O
father O
's O
body O
, O
and O
|
     | O
afterwards O
to O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
unseemly O
attendants O
who O
stood O
beside O
it O
. O

" O
It O
is O
no O
use O
, O
young O
man O
, O
to O
strive O
with O
her O

" O
said O
Betty B-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
still O
occupied O
in O
|
     | O
completing O
some O
of O
her O
lugubrious O
operations O
about O
the O
bed O
: O
" O
I O
know O
her O
better O
than O
you O
do O
. O
She O

     | O
will O
stay O
here O
watching O
him O
till O
she O
is O
as O
dead O
as O
he O
is O

rather O
than O

away O

his O

     | O
body O

be O
tended O
by O
such O
as O
those O

" O
| 
  | O
For O
a O
moment O
Michael B-PERSON
really O
felt O
all O
the O
enervating O
effects O
of O
despair O
, O
and O
stood O
perfectly O
|
     | O
incapable O
of O
even O
imagining O
any O
means O
of O
help O
for O
the O
agony O
which O
it O
wrung O
his O
heart O
to O

     | O
witness O
. O
But O
, O
as O
the O
old O
woman O
pursued O
her O
ghastly O
occupation O
, O
she O
went O
muttering O
on O
, O
|
     | O
expatiating O
on O
the O
sinful O
and O
unchristian B-NORP
outrage O
that O
was O
thus O
committed O
. O
" O

what O

     | O
rogue O
get O
by O
it O

she O
said O

a O
sneer O

" O

replied O
the O
man O
. O

all O
this O
poor O
Martha B-PERSON
appeared O
not O

, O
in O

, O
neither O

     | O
understood O

heard O
a O
word O

  O

Michael B-PERSON
did O
, O
and O
with O
sudden O
animation O
stepped O
up O
to O
the O

     | O
man O
who O
had O
spoken O
, O

whispered O
in O
his O
ear O
, O
" O
Perhaps O
we O
may O
be O
able O

settle O
this O

consult O

The O
consequence O
of O
this O
packet O
was O
another O
metamorphosis O
on O
the O
part O
of O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
" O
She O
shall O
|
     | O
not O
think O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
addressing O
Mr. O
Bell B-PERSON
, O
" O
that O
my O
respect O
for O
her O
is O
lessened O
because O
her O
|
     | O
fortune O
has O
fallen O
. O
I O
will O
wait O
upon O
her O
with O
faithful O
duty O
and O
most O
grateful O
affection O
: O
but O
|
     | O
she O
was O
born O
in O
a O
palace O
, O
and O
I O
in O
a O
cabin O
  O
and O
I O
will O
not O
, O
especially O
just O
now O
, O
obtrude O
myself O
|
     | O
upon O
her O
as O
a O
companion O
. O
As O
her O
servant O
I O
hope O
I O
may O
be O
useful O
to O
her O
, O
and O
it O
is O
in O
that O
|
     | O
capacity O
that O
I O
shall O
attend O
her O
. O
" O
| 
   | O
felt O
to O
be O
very O
unfitting O
to O
her O
situation O
. O
Her O
conscience O
, O
however O
, O
could O
not O
|
     | O
reproach O
her O
for O
this O
, O
for O
most O
assuredly O
she O
could O
not O
help O
it O
. O

  | O
Many O
were O
the O
letters O
, O
and O
various O
the O
mementos O
of O
affection O
, O
intrusted O
by O
Mr. O

Mrs. O
Bell B-PERSON

     | O
to O
the O
care O
of O
Michael B-PERSON
for O
their O
dearly O
- O
beloved O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton I-PERSON
. O
Nor O
was O
there O
an O
individual O
of O
|
     | O
whose O
welfare O
he O
thought O
it O
would O
please O
her O
to O
hear O
, O
whom O
he O
did O
not O
visit O
to O
receive O
their O

     | O
loving O
blessings O
for O
the O
benefactress O
who O
, O
notwithstanding O
her O
wide O
wanderings O
, O
had O
never O
|
     | O
failed O
to O
remember O
the O
wants O
of O
all O
who O
had O
faithfully O
served O
her O
, O
or O
in O
any O
way O
become O
|
     | O
dependent O
on O
her O
bounty O
. O
| 
  | O
These O
duties O
completed O
, O
and O
a O
farewell O
of O
most O
grateful O
affection O
uttered O
to O
the O
amiable O
|
     | O
clergyman O
and O
his O
excellent O
wife O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
set O
off O
upon O
his O
long O
journey O
with O
feelings O
of O
hope O
, O
|
     | O
joy O
, O
confidence O
, O
fear O
, O
diffidence O
, O
and O
trembling O
affection O
, O
— O
all O
so O
strongly O
mixed O
together O
in O
|
     | O
his O
bosom O
that O
, O
had O
his O
life O
depended O
on O
it O
, O
he O
could O
not O
himself O
have O
told O
which O
it O
was O
that O
|
     | O
most O
frequently O
preponderated O
. O
Yet O
, O
altogether O
, O
his O
state O
of O
mind O
was O
very O
delightful O
: O
the O
|
     | O
novelty O
and O
excitement O
of O
journeying O
, O
so O
pregnant O
of O
enjoyment O
to O
most O
of O
us O
, O
was O
most O
|
     | O
especially O
captivating O
to O
him O
, O
whose O
education O
had O
been O
little O
more O
than O
the O
unchecked O
|
     | O
development O
of O
imagination O
, O
and O
of O
that O
keen O
observation O
of O
all O
surrounding O
objects O
which O
his O
|
     | O
shepherd O
life O
had O
taught O
him O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
first B-ORDINAL
painful O
interruption O
to O
the O
state O
of O
felicity O
, O
arose O
from O
his O
finding O
himself O
under O
|
     | O
the O
necessity O
of O
confessing O
to O
Martha B-PERSON
that O
he O
had O
no O
more O
money O
wherewith O
to O
pay O
their O
way O
. O
|
     | O
Aware B-ORG
that O
in O
the O
performance O
of O
his O
self O
- O
appointed O
office O
Michael B-PERSON
would O
have O
to O
pay O
every O
|
     | O
thing O
, O
and O
keep O
a O
regular O
account O
of O
it O
  O
and O
aware O
also O
that O
the O
money O
he O
had O
received O
from O
her O
|
     | O
would O
enable O
him O
to O
do O
this O
, O
without O
giving O
him O
the O
additional O
trouble O
of O
daily B-DATE
settlements O
|
     | O
with O
her O
, O
she O
had O
merely O
said O
, O
a O
minute O
or O
two B-CARDINAL
before O
they O
set O
off O
, O
" O
You O

kind O
enough O

just B-DATE
one I-DATE

from O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
of O
their O
leaving O
Fairly O
, O
he O
was O
able O
to O
do O
this O
  O
but O
then O
the O
|
     | O
little O
remnant O
of O
his O
treasure O
failed O
him O
, O
and O
great O
as O
was O
his O
repugnance O
to O
the O
measure O
, O
he O
|
     | O
was O
compelled O
by O
dire O
necessity O
to O
confess O
that O
nearly O
the O
whole O
of O
her O
generous O
gift O
had O
gone O
|
     | O
to O
— O
" O
to O
satisfy O
the O
rapacity O
of O
Mr. O
Parsons B-PERSON
. O
" O
| 
  | O
It O
would O
be O
hardly O
possible O
for O
one B-CARDINAL
human O
being O
to O
be O
more O
grateful O
to O
another O
than O
poor O
|
     | O
Martha B-PERSON
felt O
to O
her O
young O
attendant O
after O
this O
disclosure O
. O
She O
remembered O
the O
agony O
which O
he O
had O
|
     | O
made O
to O
cease O
  O
she O
remembered O
, O
too O
, O
her O
state O
of O
utter O
incapacity O
even O
to O
comprehend O
, O
and O
still O

     | O
less O
to O
avert O
the O
horrors O
that O
surrounded O
her O
  O

of O
all O
Michael B-PERSON

respectful O
efforts O

     | O
to O
induce O
her O
to O
perform O
her O
allotted O
character O
properly O
, O
she O
never O
from O
the B-TIME
hour I-TIME
of O
this O
|
     | O
disclosure O
treated O
him O
otherwise O
than O
as O
a O
dear O
and O
valued O
friend O
. O
| 
   | O
and O
this O
was O
his O
very O
natural O
wish O
to O
ascertain O
whether O
Edward B-PERSON
and O
Fanny B-PERSON
would O
|
     | O
recognise O
him O
. O
|  
  | O
It O
was O
therefore O
still O
in O
the O
dress O

with O
the O
demeanour O
of O
a O
servant O
, O
that O
the O
poor O

now O
become O
a O
tall O
and O
very O
handsome O
young O
man O

armed O
himself O
with O
courage O
to O
enter O

     | O
the O
presence O
of O
his O
brother O

once O

draw O
near O

the O
dear O

gentle O
little O
being O

whom O
he O
had O
so O
fondly O
loved O

passed O
together O
at O
the B-LOC
Deep I-LOC

It O
had O
been O
previously O
agreed O
between O
himself O

Martha B-PERSON
, O
that O
when O
she O
sent O
for O
him O
, O

     | O
it O
should O
be O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
giving O
him O
some O
long O
and O
particular O
instructions O
respecting O
the O

     | O
luggage O

was O
to O
get O
from O
the O
custom O

at O

before O
the O
moment O
of O

arrive O

| 
  | O
The O
young O
man O
trembled O
like O
an O
aspen O
- O
leaf O
as O
he O
laid O
his O
hand O
upon O
the O
lock O
of O
the O
door O
, O
the O
|
     | O
opening O
of O
which O
would O
bring O
him O
face O
to O
face O
with O
his O
brother O
. O
And O
perchance O
he O
might O
have O
|
     | O
indulged O
in O
a O
longer O
interval O
of O
preparation O
, O
had O
not O
the O
voice O
of O
Martha B-PERSON
distinctly O
pronounced O

     | O
the O
words O
" O
Come O
in O
! O
" O
Further O
delay O
was O
out O
of O
the O
question O

he O
pushed O
forward O
the O
door O
, O
and O
|
     | O
entered O
. O
| 
  | O
The O
first B-ORDINAL
figure O
that O
his O
eyes O
fell O
upon O
was O
that O
of O
a O
young O
lady O
— O
small O
, O
and O
of O
very O
|
     | O
delicate O
proportions O
— O
whose O
head O
, O
which O
was O
hanging O
over O
some O
employment O
as O
the O
door O
opened O
, O
|
     | O
was O
raised O
as O
he O
entered O
, O
displaying O
to O
him O
a O
very O
lovely O
face O
, O
and O
a O
pair O
of O
eyes O
whose O
dark O
|
     | O
brilliance O
almost O
made O
the O
beholder O
wink O

Could O
that O
be O
Fanny B-PERSON
Fletcher I-PERSON
? O
No O
. O
Yet O
that O
it O
should O
|
     | O
be O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
seemed O
more O
impossible O
still O
. O
Like O
all O
young O
people O
who O
have O
been O
separated O
|
     | O
from O
some O
one O
considerably O
older O
than O
themselves O
, O
ever O
since O
the O
period O
when O
this O
difference O

     | O
made O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
appear O
fully O
grown O
, O
while O
the O
other O
was O
still O
a O
child O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
fancied O
that O
in O

     | O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
he O
should O
see O
an O
elderly O
person O
, O
no O
more O
like O
a O
pretty O
girl O
, O
than O
he O
was O
|
     | O
himself O
. O
But O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton I-PERSON
had O
not O
fully O
completed O
her O
twenty B-DATE
- I-DATE
ninth I-DATE

and O
happening O
, O

     | O
moreover O
, O
to O
be O
very O
peculiarly O
young O
- O
looking O
both O
in O
face O
and O
figure O
, O
it O
was O
not O
very O
|
     | O
wonderful O
that O
he O
should O
doubt O
of O
her O
identity O
  O
for O
it O
was O
in O
truth O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton I-PERSON
, O
and O
no O
|
     | O
other O
, O
whose O
bright O
and O
laughing O
loveliness O
made O
him O
turn O
his O
admiring O
eyes O
away O
, O
in O
search O
of O
|
     | O
something O
dearer O
, O
though O
not O
more O
beautiful O
. O
| 
   | O
operation O
with O
the O
lock O
of O
the O
door O
. O
Martha B-PERSON
played O
her O
part O
admirably O
, O
appearing O
|
     | O
to O
be O
the O
most O
exceedingly O
particular O
young O
lady O
, O
about O
boxes O

that O
ever O

     | O
travelled O

  | O
" O
Remember O

she O

     | O
let O
them O
touch O
a O

article O
that O
you O

not O

the O
whole O

be O

ran O
on O
at O
the O
imminent O

classed O
by O

clever O
friend O
Mary B-PERSON
as O
the O
veriest O
fidget O
that O
ever O
arrived O
to O
bore O
a O

     | O
peaceable O
household O
and O
all O
in O
order O
to O
give O
her O
poor O
companion O
time O
to O
recover O
himself O
, O
and O

     | O
see O
distinctly O
what O
was O
before O
him O
. O
| 
  | O
But O
Michael B-PERSON
could O
not O
recover O
himself O
, O
nor O
could O
he O
even O
find O
courage O
to O
look O
about O
him O
. O
It O
|
     | O
was O
a O
large O
saloon O
that O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
occupied O
, O
and O
the O
agitated O
young O
man O
rather O
felt O
that O
|
     | O
there O
was O
a O
gentleman O
occupied O
with O
books O
and O
papers O
at O
a O
distant O
table O
, O
than O
saw O
him O
. O
Yet O
to O
|
     | O
see O
him O
he O
was O
determined O
, O
if O
his O
life O
were O
to O
be O
the O
forfeit O
  O
and O
turning O
his O
head O
with O
an O
eye O
|
     | O
as O
troubled O
as O
that O
of O
Hamlet B-WORK_OF_ART
, O
when O
tremblingly O
following O
his O
father O
's O
spirit O
, O
he O
stood O
at O
last O
|
     | O
with O
clasped O
hands O
, O
protruded O
head O
, O
and O
features O
almost O
convulsed O
with O
emotion O
, O
when O
he O
had O
an O
|
     | O
uninterrupted O
view O
of O
his O
brother O
's O
clam O
and O
beautiful O
countenance O
. O
| 
  | O
Edward B-PERSON
was O
very O
busily O
employed O
, O
and O
unconsciously O
submitted O
himself O
to O
this O
examination O
|
     | O
without O
raising O
his O
eyes O
, O
or O
moving O
in O
any O
way O
  O
but O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
's O
ear O
caught O
something O
like O
|
     | O
a O
sob O
from O
the O
silent O
object O
of O
all O
Martha B-PERSON
's O
eloquence O
, O
and O
suddenly O
looking O
up O
perceived O
|
     | O
Michael B-PERSON
in O
the O
attitude O
described O
, O
but O
stealthily O
, O
and O
perhaps O
unknowingly O
approaching O
Edward B-PERSON
's O
|
     | O
table O
, O
while O
the O
tears O
he O
could O
no O
longer O
check O
, O
rolled O
down O
his O
manly O
cheek O
. O
| 
  | O
There O
are O
some O
individuals O
of O
the O
human O
family O
gifted O
with O
such O
quickness O
of O
perception O
, O
and O
|
     | O
rapidity O
of O
inference O
, O
that O
their O
faculties O
act O
with O
the O
certainty O
of O
instinct O
, O
and O
the O
|
     | O
brilliancy O
of O
inspiration O
. O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
was O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
those O
  O
and O
after O
looking O
for O
a B-TIME
minute I-TIME
or O
|
     | O
two B-CARDINAL
at O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
quite O
as O
earnestly O
as O
Michael B-PERSON
looked O
at O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
she O
sprung O
from O
the O
sofa O
, O
|
     | O
pushed O
the O
table O
that O
stood O
before O
it O
with O
such O
violence O
from O
her O
as O
nearly O
to O
overset O
it O
, O
and O
|
     | O
rushing O
forward O
laid O
her O
hand O
upon O
his O
arm O
, O
exclaiming O
, O
" O
For O
mercy O
's O
sake O
tell O
me O
young O
man O
, O
|
     | O
who O
you O
are O
, O
and O
where O
you O
come O
from O
? O
" O
| 
  | O
On O
hearing O
these O
words O
in O
a O
voice O
unusually O
loud O
and O
agitated O
, O
Edward B-PERSON
rose O
hastily O
from O
his O
|
     | O
seat O
, O
and O
approached O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
as O
if O
to O
protect O
her O
from O
some O
threatened O
danger O
  O
but O
|
     | O
turning O
towards O
him O
, O
she O
held O
up O
her O
hand O
as O
if O
to O
prevent O
his O
hostile O
approach O
, O
and O
said O
, O
|
     | O
" O
Stay B-WORK_OF_ART
Edward I-WORK_OF_ART
, O
stay O
! O
Look O
at O
him O
! O
Good O
Heaven O
! O
Look O
at O
him O
, O
dearest O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
and O
tell O
me O
who O
he O
|
     | O
is O
like O
! O
" O
| 
   | O
distracted O
eyes O
fixed O
themselves O
on O
the O
agitated O
face O
before O
him O
as O
if O
they O
would O
|
     | O
read O
in O
it O
the O
history O
of O
years B-DATE
. O
|  
  | O
" O
Edward O
! O
— O
Teddy O
! O
" O
cried O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
opening O
his O
arms O
, O
and O
making O
a O
step O
in O
advance O
. O
| 
  | O
In O
the O
next O
instant O
the O
brothers O
were O
locked O
in O
each O
other O
's O
arms O
, O
and O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
drew O
|
     | O
back O
, O
and O
gazed O
upon O
them O
from O
a O
distance O
as O
if O
the O
very O
ground O
that O
sustained O
hearts O
under O
the O
|
     | O
influence O
of O
such O
feelings O
was O
holy O
— O
while O
Fanny B-PERSON
Fletcher I-PERSON
, O
rose O
and O
sat O
down O
, O
and O
rose O
again O
, O
|
     | O
checking O
the O
feeling O
that O
would O
have O
sent O
her O
to O
stretch O
forth O
a O
hand O
of O
welcome O
to O
her O
old O
|
     | O
friend O
, O
by O
telling O
herself O
that O
no O
hand O
, O
no O
voice O
but O
Edward B-PERSON
's O
could O
be O
cared O
for O
then O
. O
And O
|
     | O
perhaps O
she O
was O
right O
  O
for O
it O
is O
certain O
that O
for O
several B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
, O
neither O
Edward B-PERSON
nor O
Michael B-PERSON
|
     | O
were O
fully O
conscious O
where O
they O
were O
, O
nor O
who O
they O
might O
be O
that O
were O
near O
them O
. O
Once O
and O
again O
|
     | O
each O
beating O
heart O
was O
strained O
against O
the O
brother O
heart O
, O
and O
then O
, O
their O
right O
hands O
clasped O
, O
|
     | O
and O
the O
left O
placed O
, O
each O
on O
the O
other O
's O
shoulder O
, O
" O
They O
fell O
to O
such O
perusal O
of O
the O
face O
, O
" O
|
     | O
that O
now O
, O
after O
eight B-DATE
cruel I-DATE
years I-DATE
of O
absence O
, O
was O
once O
more O
beaming O
with O
love O
and O
sympathy O
|
     | O
before O
their O
eyes O
, O
that O
it O
must O
have O
been O
a O
very O
heartless O
and O
soulless O
being O
who O
should O
have O
|
     | O
come O
between O
them O
. O
| 
  | O
Though O
such O
a O
history O
as O
Michael B-PERSON
's O
might O
well O
have O
occupied O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
long O
summer O
's O
day O

     | O
in O
the O
telling O

to O
ears O
so O
greedy O
of O
every O
circumstance O
connected O
with O
it O
as O
were O
those O
of O
|
     | O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
yet O
it O
is O
wonderful O
how O
very O
short O
a O
time O
sufficed O
to O
point O
out O
the O
keystone O
of O
the O

     | O
arch O
, O
upon O
which O
the O
whole O
wonderful O
fabric O
hung O
, O
and O
then O
it O
was O
that O
Fanny B-PERSON
Fletcher I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
voice O

     | O
was O
heard O
exclaiming O
in O
a O
burst O
of O
uncontrollable O
emotion O
, O
| 
  | O
" O
Then O
it O
was O
I O
that O
caused O
it O
all O
! O
Oh O
! O
Miss O
Brotherton B-PERSON
, O
it O
was O
I O
who O
kept O
him O

that O
horrid O

place O
for O
years B-DATE

Had O
I O
not O
told O
you O

ever O

" O

This O
was O
uttered O
with O
such O
agitated O
rapidity O
, O
that O
though O
there O
was O
more B-CARDINAL

     | O
who O
would O

ready O
enough O
to O
contradict O
the O
self O

accusing O
statement O
, O
she O
gave O
them O
no O
|
     | O
time O
for O
it O
. O
But O
it O
sufficed O
to O
draw O
Michael B-PERSON
from O
the O
side O
of O
his O
brother O
, O
and O
to O
place O
him O
at O

     | O
hers O
  O
and O
though O
this O
terrible O
thought O
drew O
a O
shower O
of O
tears O
from O
Fanny B-PERSON
's O
eyes O
, O

     | O
notwithstanding O
the O
exceeding O
happiness O
which O
was O
at O
the O
very O

moment O
throbbing O
at O
her O

may O

For O
some B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
this O
lasted O
without O

interrupted O
by O
a O
word O
from O
any O
one O

     | O
both O

not O

her O
taste O
it O
without O

     | O
the O
addition O
of O
a O
little O
mystification O

accordingly O
she O

her O
into O

Englishman O

the O
saloon O

she O

     | O
countryman O

To O
this O
the O
tractable O
old O
lady O
agreed O

without O
testifying O
any O
very O
lively O
emotion O

when O

     | O
she O
had O
got O
into O

the O
group O

witnessed O
the O
general O
exaltation O
of O
spirits O

a O
little O
while O
she O

hid O

the O

and O
till O
I O
had O
taught O
them O
to O
do O
so O
I O
never O
could O
feel O
that O
they O

understood O
the O

the O

existence O

dearest O
Michael B-PERSON

come O

shake O
this O
perfect O

delightful O
union O

introducing O

this O
did O
not O
satisfy O
the O

exigeante O

     | O
lady O

who O
shook O
her O
head O

held O
up O
her O
finger O
in O
reproof O

" O
Dearest O
Mary B-PERSON

then O
— O
" O
he O

     | O
resumed O
, O
colouring O
brightly O
, O
and O
with O
a O
smile O
that O
made O
her O
think O
she O
could O
trace O
a O
family O

     | O
likeness O
to O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
" O
the O
greatest O
wish O

on O
earth O

to O
become O
such O
as O
you O
might O
approve O

     | O
and O
if O
I O
shrink O
from O
the O
dear O

precious O
familiarity O
which O
must O
make O
Edward B-PERSON

Fanny B-PERSON
so O

     | O
happy O

not O
that O
I O
am O
incapable O
of O
loving O
you O

perfectly O

they O

remember O
, O

     | O
dearest O
lady O

that O
however O
humble O
their O
origin O

the O
very O
circumstance O
of O
their O
having O
been O
your O

     | O
honoured O
companions O
for O
years B-DATE

is O
of O
itself O
sufficient O
to O
raise O
them O
to O
such O
a O
tone O
of O
thinking O

     | O
and O
of O
manners O
, O
as O
may O
, O
in O
some O
sort O
, O
justify O
their O
using O
the O
privilege O
you O
so O
graciously O

     | O
afford O
. O
But O
, O
alas O
! O
You O
must O
know O
too O
well O
that O
the O
case O
is O
far O
different O
with O
me O

The O
|
     | O
overflowing O
joy O
of O
our O
first B-ORDINAL
meeting O
, O
naturally O
broke O
down O
, O
as O
it O
were O
, O
all O
inequalities O
, O
all O
|
     | O
boundaries O
, O
and O
I O
certainly O
felt O
, O
and O
perhaps O
spoke O
, O
as O
if O
I O
too O
were O
one O
of O
the O
accomplished O

     | O
little O
circle O
that O
might O
call O
this O
earthly O
paradise O
their O
home O

But O
reflection O
will O
come O
, O
most O

     | O
generous O
Mary B-PERSON
! O
if O
not O
amidst O
the O
happy O
intoxicating O
moments O
of O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
it O
will O
make O
itself O
a O

     | O
voice O
in O
the O
quiet O
reasoning O
meditations O
of O
the O
night O
, O
and O
so O
loudly O
has O
this O
voice O
been O
heard O

     | O
by O
me O
, O
that O
I O
can O
not O
— O
no O

in O
spite O
of O
all O
the O
happiness O
that O
surrounds O
me O

I O
can O
not O
live O
on O

thus O
, O
an O
idle O

" O

circumstances O

be O
abandoned O

     | O
for O

for O
many O
reasons O
this O
would O
have O
been O
a O
source O
of O
lasting O
regret O
to O
her O
. O
It O
was O

     | O
therefore O
with O
cordial O
approbation O
that O
after O
the O
interval O
of O
a O
few O
moments O
, O
she O
replied O

     | O
" O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
you O
are O
right O

Nature O
has O
done O
so O
much O

you O

that O
our O

easily O

had O
you O
shown O
less O
courage O

have O
tempted O
us O
to O
fancy O
that O

     | O
you O
wanted O
nothing O
which O
you O
have O
not O
got O
, O
or O
which O
we O
could O
not O
give O
you O

But O
you O
are O
quite O

     | O
right O
in O
refusing O
to O
consent O
to O
this O
. O
We O
will O
immediately O
return O
to O
Germany B-GPE
where O
you O
shall O
be O

     | O
placed O
at O
the O
same O
admirable O
institution O
that O
so O
rapidly O
made O
your O

well O
- O
directed O
devotion O
to O

my O
dear O
Michael B-PERSON

will O
perhaps O
make O
you O
feel O

     | O
more O
at O
your O
ease O
among O

dearest O

exclaimed O
Michael B-PERSON
— O
while O
perhaps O
the O
brightest O

     | O
beam O
of O
hope O
that O
ever O
yet O
shot O
from O
his O
eyes O

met O
hers O

she O
affectionately O
gazed O
upon O
him O

" O
that O

What O
you O
now O
propose O

would O
be O

     | O
a O
happiness O

the O
idea O
of O
which O
I O
think O
I O
should O
have O
turned O
from O
, O
even O
in O
my O
dreams O

from O
shame O

     | O
at O
its O
towering O
ambition O

All O
I O
meant O
to O
ask O
was O
, O
your O
kind O
aid O
to O
place O
me O
in O
some O
business O

     | O
where O
I O
might O
earn O
a O
maintenance O
, O
that O
in O
a B-DATE
year I-DATE

now O
, O
Michael B-PERSON

I O
tell O
you O

Besides O
my O
own O
particular O
objection O

such O
a O
mode O
of O
proceeding O

I O
have O
lately O

     | O
heard O
a O
little O
anecdote O
of O
you O
, O
from O
your O
friend O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
which O
makes O
it O
very O
doubtful O
whether O

     | O
you O
deserve O
that O
species O
of O
independence O
— O
for O
she O
put O
it O
in O
your O
possession O
once O
, O
you O
know O

     | O

you O
could O
not O
keep O
it O
. O
I O
shall O
manage O
better O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
depend O
upon O
it O

One B-DATE
week I-DATE
more O
of O

     | O
idleness O
in O
this O
sweet O
spot O

and O
then O
we O
travel O
back O
to O
Germany B-GPE

You O

not O

left O
to O

a O
more O

an O
easy O
distance O

you O

my O
dear O
Michael B-PERSON

One B-CARDINAL
corner O

hold O
us O

another O
is O
beautified O

it O

up O

themselves O

thick O
enough O
to O
exclude O

, O
Michael B-PERSON

throwing O
himself O
upon O
a O
bank O
, O

casting O
his O
hat O
away O
, O
clasped O
his O
hands O
, O

     | O
and O
raising O
his O
eyes O
to O
heaven O
, O
exclaimed O
, O
" O
Edward B-PERSON

she O

an O
angel O

  | O
Edward B-PERSON
had O
not O
followed O
his O
brother O

example O
, O
in O
lying O
down O
, O
but O
stood O
before O
him O
in O
act O
to O

     | O
listen O
. O
But O
there O
was O
something O
in O
these O
words O
that O
seemed O
to O
shake O
him O
, O
for O
he O
turned O
away O

     | O
without O
answering O

" O
Has O
she O

resumed O
Michael B-PERSON
. O

  | O
" O
Yes O

replied O
Edward B-PERSON

gravely O

, O
my O

my O
Edward B-PERSON

so O
composedly O

" O
| 
  | O
" O
First B-ORDINAL
, O
dear O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
because O
it O
is O
no O
news O
to O
me O
. O
And O
secondly B-ORDINAL
, O
because O
I O
am O
a O
selfish O

     | O
wretch O
, O
and O
was O
thinking O
, O
perhaps O
, O
more O
of O
my O
own O
interest O

of O
yours O

Forgive O
me O
for O
it O
, O
my O

     | O
own O
dear O
Michael B-PERSON
! O
But O
I O
would O
rather O
have O
had O
it O
decided O
that O
we O
should O
have O
both O
marched O
off O
, O

     | O
and O
taken O
service O
under O
the O
Emperor O
of O
Austria B-GPE
. O
I O
know O
that O
commissions O
would O
have O
been O

obtained O
for O
us O
. O
" O
| 
  | O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
as O
his O
brother O
uttered O
these O
words O
, O
looked O
up O
into O
his O
face O
with O
an O
expression O
of O
|
     | O
such O
astonishment O
and O
dismay O
, O
that O
the O
blood O
rushed O
to O
Edward B-PERSON
's O
face O
, O
and O
he O
turned O
away O

     | O
conceal O
his O
confusion O
. O

  | O
" O
Edward B-PERSON
! O
you O
are O
a O
mystery O
to O
me O
, O
" O
exclaimed O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
springing O
upon O
his O
feet O
, O
and O
taking O
his O

     | O
brother O
by O
the O
arm O

" O
Can O
it O
be O
possible O
that O
you O
are O
weary O

weary O

it O

weary O

rising O
every O
day O
to O
feel O
that O
I O

a O
wretch O

     | O
unworthy O

the O
breath O

it O

here O

It O
was O
now O
poor O
Michael B-PERSON

turn O
to O
change O
colour O
, O
and O
he O
did O
so O
pretty O
violently O
— O
for O
first B-ORDINAL
|
     | O
he O
became O
very O
red O
, O
and O
then O
exceedingly O
pale O
. O
That O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
such O
as O
he O
had O
ever O
remembered O
him O
, O

     | O
such O
as O
he O
found O
him O
now O

that O

should O
so O
very O
solemnly O
declare O
himself O
to O
be O
a O
wretch O

     | O
unworthy O
of O

was O
a O
horror O
and O
a O
misery O
as O
terrible O
as O
it O
was O
unexpected O
. O
He O
had O
no O
power O

     | O
to O
utter O
any O
soothing O
in O
contradiction O
to O
this O
appalling O
statement O
, O
for O
, O
alas O
! O
it O
might O
be O
true O

     | O
— O
and O
Michael B-PERSON
's O
heart O
sunk O
within O
him O
as O
he O
remembered O
how O
totally O
ignorant O
he O
was O
of O
every O

     | O
thing O
that O
might O
enable O
him O
to O
disbelieve O
it O

Silently O
the O
brothers O
walked O
on O
for O
some O
paces O
, O
|
     | O
side O
by O
side O
. O
They O
were O
both O
of O
them O
either O
unwilling O

unable O
to O
speak O

At O
length O
a O
sort O
of O

     | O
shuddering O
emotion O
that O
passed O
through O
Michael B-PERSON
's O
frame O
, O
made O
itself O
felt O
by O
the O
arm O
of O
Edward B-PERSON
, O

     | O
which O
he O
still O
held O
, O

then O
he O
stopped O
, O
and O
without O
raising O
his O
eyes O
from O
the O
ground O
, O

     | O
said O
, O

" O
Michael B-PERSON

is O
it O
you O

you O

guilty O

some O

criminal O

perhaps O
I O
might O
  O

still O
I O
doubt O

I O
should O
understand O
the O
phrase O
as O
you O

     | O
do O

It O
is O
so O
difficult O

so O
impossible O

express O
temperately O

soberly O

my O
own O
reprobation O

continued O
more O
tranquilly O

one O

a O
fervour O

confession O

presence O

the O
belief O

both O

on O
a O
new O

give O
himself O
a O
chance O

had O
so O

goodness O

looking O
in O

face O
with O
an O
expression O

The O
familiar O

not O

     | O
assumed O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
proving O
his O
obedience O

but O
resulted O
from O
a O
genuine O
feeling O
of O

     | O
affectionate O
confidence O
in O
every O
word O
she O
had O
uttered O

and O
which O
had O
left O
on O
his O
mind O
the O

     | O
belief O
that O
she O
was O
not O
only O
his O
generous O
patroness O

his O
loving O
friend O

" O
I O

About O
Edward B-PERSON

" O
said O
Mary B-PERSON
colouring I-PERSON
, O
" O
what O
do O
you O
wish O
to O
say O
about O
him O
, O
dear O
Michael B-PERSON

" O

  | O
" O
It O
is O
something O
that O
he O
declares O
he O
would O
die O
rather O
than O
say O
to O
you O
himself O
, O
" O
replied O

     | O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
" O
but O
I O
am O
certain O
that O
you O
ought O
to O
know O
it O
, O
for O
it O
is O
quite O
clear O
that O
there O
is O
no O

Michael B-PERSON

do O
not O

Did O

commission O
you O

" O

" O
Oh O

no O

had O
he O
felt O
courage O

that O

, O
I O
should O
have O
told O
him O
at O

, O
that O
he O

     | O
had O
better O
do O
it O
himself O

replied O
Michael B-PERSON

" O
Indeed O
I O
fear O
greatly O
that O
he O
will O
be O

I O
can O
not O
bear O

replied O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
looking O
with O
considerable O

     | O
surprise O
at O
her O
varying O
colour O

agitated O

  O
" O

I O
fear O

" O

" O

" O
In O
one B-CARDINAL
word O

, O
" O
resumed O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
" O
our O
dear O

eagerly O

an O
unfortunate O
passion O

of O

On O

a O
very O
agitated O

untranquil O
air O

Mary B-PERSON

rushed O
out O

the O

much O
to O
Michael B-PERSON

astonishment O
  O
for O
he O

     | O
could O
by O
no O

comprehend O

why O

she O
should O
testify O
such O
very O
strong O
emotion O
, O

     | O
especially O
as O
he O
had O
so O
cautiously O

delicately O
avoided O

great O
wisdom O

shown O
by O
such O

is O
infinitely O

better O
that O

such O
