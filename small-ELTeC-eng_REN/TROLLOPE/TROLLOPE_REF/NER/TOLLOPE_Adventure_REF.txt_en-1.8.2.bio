PREFACE O

When O
the O
author O
of O
" O
Michael B-PERSON
Armstrong I-PERSON
" E-PERSON
first S-ORDINAL
determined O
on O
attempting O
to O
draw O
the O
attention O
of O
her O
countrymen O
to O
the O
fearful O
evils O
inherent O
in O
the B-ORG
Factory I-ORG
System E-ORG
, O
as O
carried O
out O
in O
our O
manufacturing O
towns O
, O
she O
intended O
to O
divide O
her O
work O
into O
two S-CARDINAL
portions O
, O
which O
should O
present O
the O
same O
subject O
under O
two S-CARDINAL
different O
phases O
. O
It O
was O
her O
intention O
in O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
of O
these O
to O
drag O
into O
the O
light O
of O
day O
, O
and O
place O
before O
the O
eyes O
of O
Englishmen S-NORP
, O
the O
hideous O
mass O
of O
injustice O
and O
suffering O
to O
which O
thousands S-CARDINAL
of O
infant O
labourers O
are O
subjected O
, O
who O
toil O
in O
our O
monster O
spinning O
- O
mills O
. O
In O
the O
second S-ORDINAL
, O
she O
proposed O
that O
the O
hero O
of O
her O
tale O
, O
having O
lived O
through O
his O
toil O
- O
worn O
boyhood O
, O
should O
have O
been O
seen O
embarked O
in O
those O
perfectly O
constitutional O
struggles O
for O
the O
amelioration O
of O
the O
sufferings O
of O
his O
class O
, O
in O
which O
many O
of O
the O
more O
enlightened O
operatives O
have O
been O
for O
some B-DATE
years E-DATE
engaged O
. O
The O
first S-ORDINAL
division O
of O
the O
subject O
has O
been O
some O
time O
in O
the O
reader's O
hands O
. O
The O
true O
but O
most O
painful O
picture O
has O
been O
drawn O
faithfully O
and O
conscientiously O
. O
Of O
course O
voices O
have O
been O
raised O
to O
deny O
loudly O
the O
truth O
of O
all O
the O
author's O
statements O
, O
and O
to O
assert O
the O
whole O
to O
be O
a O
mere O
tissue O
of O
invention O
and O
falsehood O
. O
The O
same O
charges O
have O
been O
made O
against O
her O
upon O
another O
occasion O
, O
and O
she O
has O
lived O
to O
see O
the O
truth O
of O
her O
statements O
, O
so O
impugned O
, O
universally O
admitted O
. O
She O
awaits O
with O
perfect O
confidence O
the O
time O
when O
similar O
justice O
shall O
be O
rendered O
to O

pages O

misguided O

unfortunate O
men O

a O
course O

must O
necessarily O
neutralize O
the O
efforts O
of O
their O
true O
friends O

When O
those O
in O
whose O
behalf O
she O
hoped O
to O
move O

sympathy O

violence O

themselves O
with O

whose O
doctrines O
are O
subversive O
of O
every O

author O
feels O
that O

alike O

in O
violation O
of O

own O
principles O

injury O
to O

cause O

in O
an O
attempt O

hold O
up O
as O
objects O

public O

who O
have O
stained O
their O
righteous O
cause O
with O
deeds O
of O
violence O

The O
author O
is O
well O
aware O
that O

Under O

, O
being O
the O
busiest O
of O

, O
is O
probably O
the O
richest O
in O

there O
was O
not O
any O
one O
who O
could O
vie O
in O
wealth O
with O
him O
. O
In O
a O
word O
, O
he O
shone O
amidst O
his O
rich O
neighbours O
like O
a O
golden O
sun O
, O
surrounded O
by O
silver O
moons O
. O
But O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
was O
a O
superior O
man O
in O
all O
ways O
. O
He O
was O
six B-QUANTITY
feet I-QUANTITY
two I-QUANTITY

in O
height O
, O
and O
stout O
in O
proportion O
, O
with O
hands O
and O
feet O
that O
might O
have O
sufficed O
a O
giant O
. O
His O
intellectual O
gifts O
were O
also O
of O
no O
ordinary O
character O
. O
He O
liked O
well O
enough O
, O
perhaps O
, O
to O
stand O
pre-eminent O
in O
the O
commercial O
estimation O
of O
his O
neighbours O
| | O
but O
so O
enlightened O
was O
his O
spirit O
, O
that O
he O
liked O
better O
still O
to O
shine O
before O
their O
eyes O
as O
a O
man O
of O
taste O
, O
a O
literary O
and O
accomplished O
gentleman O

speaker O

But O
beyond O
all O

, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
valued O
himself O
upon O
his O
reputation O
for O
the O
lighter O
graces O
of O
wit O
and O
gallantry O
: O
he O
sought O
to O
make O
himself O

did O
not O

with O
assiduity O

perseverance O
of O
the O
highest O
order O

He O
was O
often O
heard O
to O
declare O
, O
that O
he O
loved O
nothing O
so O
well O
as O
the O
promotion O

The O
wife O

rightly O

that O
when O
such O
matters O

unceasingly O
discussed O

Nevertheless O

with O

qualities O
outshone O
, O
as O
they O
always O
ought O
to O
do O
, O
all O
her O
external O
graces O
. O
She O
was O
a O
faithful O
and O
exceedingly O
fond O
wife O
, O
and O
doted O
upon O
all O
her O
children O
| | O
no O
woman O
could O
more O
heartily O
detest O
every O
species O
of O
light O
flirting O
airs O
in O
females O
, O
and O
, O
being O
deeply O
sensible O
of O
the O
dangerous O
attractions O
of O
youth O
and O
beauty O
in O
her O
own O
sex O
, O
she O
studiously O
avoided O
bringing O
those O
of O
her O
family O
who O
might O
suffer O
thereby O
from O
coming O
in O
contact O
with O
any O
thing O
of O
the O
kind O
| | O
so O
that O
the O
female O
portion O
of O
her O
establishment O
consisted O
of O
the O
ugliest O
set O
of O
neat O
and O
carefully O
dressed O
middle O
- O
aged O
women O
that O
ever O
were O
found O
assembled O
together O
. O
The O
knight O
and O
his O
excellent O
lady O
were O
blessed O
with O
a O
very O
numerous O
progeny O
, O
certainly O
not O
less B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
eighteen I-CARDINAL
or I-CARDINAL
twenty E-CARDINAL
| | O
but O
, O
as O
they O
were O
rarely O
all O
at O
home O
together O
, O
it O
was O
at O
no O
time O
easy O
to O
count O
them O
. O
Augustus S-PERSON
, O
the O
eldest O
of O
the O
family O
, O
was O
a O
prodigiously O
fine O
young O
man O
, O
just O
returned O
from O
college O
. O
He O
had O
not O
indeed O
thought O
it O
necessary O
to O
take O
a O
degree O
, O
nor O
did O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
or O
her O
ladyship O
particularly O
wish O
it O
| | O
both O
of O
them O
being O
of O
opinion O
that O
little O
distinction O
could O
be O
gained O
by O
the O
assumption O
of O
a O
title O
which O
was O
never O
used O
in O
society O
, O
and O
to O
which O
he O
conceived O
every O
Englishman S-NORP
to O
be O
eligible O
who O
could O
just O
read O
and O
write O
a O
little O
. O
But O
as O
, O
on O
all O
points O
that O
concerned O
the O
interest O
of O
his O
eldest O
son O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
was O
too O
deeply O
interested O
to O
run O
any O
risk O
of O
blundering O
: O
he O
did O
not O
give O
his O
consent O
for O
the O
return O
of O
Augustus S-PERSON
, O
without O
his O
having O
gone O
through O
this O
idle O
academic O
ceremony O
, O
till O
he O
had O
paid O
a O
visit O
to O
the O
rector O
of O
his O
parish O
, O
to O
elicit O
from O
him O
some O
information O
on O
the O
subject O
. O
" O
May O
I O
ask O
, O
sir O
, O
" O
said O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
abruptly O
, O
" O
what O
degree O
you O
took O
at O
the O
university O
? O
" O
degree O
at O
all O

but O
, O
though O
a O
good O
man O
, O
and O
an O
excellent O
clergyman O
to O
boot O
, O
he O
had O
a O
strong O
taste O
for O
humour O
, O
and O
had O
already O
discovered O
that O
his O
neighbour O
at O
the O
great O
house O
was O
rich O
in O
more O
ways O
than O
one O
. O
It O
was O
, O
therefore O
, O
with O
the O
utmost O
civility O
that O
he O
answered O
, O
" O
My O
degree O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
was O
that O
of O
Master O
of O
Arts O

" O
" O
And O
pray O
, O
sir O
, O
does O
it O
give O
you O
any O
title O
by O
which O
you O
can O
be O
distinguished O
as O
in O
any O
way O
a O
superior O
sort O
of O
person O
in O
society O
? O
" O
" O
I O
am O
afraid O
not O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
" O
was O
the O
reply O
. O
" O
I O
thank O
you O
, O
sir O
, O
for O
your O
sincerity O
, O
" O
rejoined O
the O
knight O
. O
" O
It O
was O
important O
that O
I O
should O
ascertain O
the O
truth O
on O
this O
point O
. O
— O
You O
are O

then O
, O

" O
" O
I O
have O
never O
yet O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
met O
with O
any O
one O
of O
sufficient O
politeness O
to O
do O
me O
that O
honour O
, O
" O
replied O
Mr. O
Hetherington S-PERSON
gravely O
. O
" O
And O
I O
suppose O
you O
have O
lived O
in O
respectable O
society O
? O
" O
" O
Very O
decent O
society O
— O
very O
decent O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
" O
replied O
Hetherington S-PERSON
, O
whose O
mother O
was O
the O
daughter O
of O
a O
distinguished O
nobleman O
. O
" O
Good O
morning O
, O
sir O

I O
shall O
be O
happy O
to O
see O
you O
at O
Dowling B-FAC
Lodge E-FAC
— O
that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
sir O
, O
if O
your O
gown O
does O
not O
lead O
you O
to O
object O
to O
elegant O
amusements O
. O
I O
love O
science O
, O
Mr. O
Hetherington S-PERSON
, O
and O
am O
indeed O
devoted O
to O
every O
thing O
intellectual O

but O
, O
notwithstanding O
this O
, O
I O
am O
a O
worshipper O
at O
the O
shrine O
of O
grace O
and O
wit O
, O
and O
could O
not O
exist O
among O
people O
who O
did O
not O
relish O
the O
lighter O
embellishments O
of O
society O

" O
" O
I O
shall O
be O
happy O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
to O
share O
in O
your O
gayer O
hours O
, O
provided O
I O
am O
fortunate O
enough O

find O
that O
you O

no O
objection O
to O
profit O
by O
my O
graver O
ones O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
clergyman O
. O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
returned O
from O
this O
visit O
very O
well O
pleased O
with O
the O
new O
rector O
. O
Mr. O
Augustus S-PERSON
was O
immediately O
comforted O
by O
a O
letter O
, O
informing O
him O
that O
he O
might O
call O
in O
his O
accounts O
, O
and O
prepare O
to O
leave O
the O
university O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
pleased O
| | O
and O
, O
within O
ten B-DATE
days E-DATE
after O
receiving O
it O
, O
the O
amiable O
young O
man O
was O
restored O
to O
the O
bosom O
of O
his O
family O
. O
lady O
had O
ever O
been O
in O
Scotland S-GPE
in O
their O
lives O
, O
showed O
great O
enlargement O
of O
national O
feeling O
. O
Altogether O
, O
it O
was O
considered O
to O
be O
the O
finest O
family O
ever O
seen O
. O
It O
happened O
upon O
a O
broiling O
day O
about B-DATE
the I-DATE
middle I-DATE
of I-DATE
July E-DATE
, O
during O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
hottest O
summers O
England S-GPE
had O
ever O
known O
, O
that O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
and O
Lady B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
" O
entertained O
a O
party O
of O
distinguished O
fashionables O
" O
at O
dinner O
. O
It O
may O
have O
been O
remarked O
by O
those O
who O
study O
such O
subjects O
, O
that O
there O
is O
a O
difference O
between O
a O
dinner O
- O
party O
given O
at O
such O
a O
grand O
mansion O
as O
that O
of O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
, O
and O
one O
at O
a O
dwelling O
of O
perhaps O
not O
a O
quarter O
the O
size O
, O
where O
the O
owners O
are O
of O
a O
different O
order O
of O
the O
aristocracy O
, O
having O
a O
longer O
pedigree O
, O
and O
a O
shorter O
purse O
. O
At O
both O
, O
probably O
, O
the O
banquet O
will O
be O
a O
costly O
one O
, O
yet O
the O
one S-CARDINAL
entertainment O
will O
come O
off O
in O
a O
manner O
as O
unlike O
as O
possible O
to O
the O
other O
. O
There O
is O
something O
in O
the O
usual O
way O
of O
wearing O
stiff O
new O
- O
made O
grandeur O
, O
not O
far O
unlike O
that O
of O
wearing O
stiff O
new O
- O
made O
clothes O
. O
Neither O
the O
one O
nor O
the O
other O
sit O
easily O
. O
At O
this O
splendid O
dinner O
at O
Dowling B-FAC
Lodge E-FAC
, O
the O
company O
consisted O
of O
a O
selection O
from O
the O
neighbouring O
families O
, O
made O
on O
the O
most O
legitimate O
principles O
of O
exclusiveness O
| | O
no O
family O
being O
invited O
who O
did O
not O
drive O
four S-CARDINAL
horses O
at O
the O
races O
. O
To O
this O
there O
were O
indeed O
two S-CARDINAL
exceptions O
. O
The O
first S-ORDINAL
was O
the O
Right O
Honourable O
Lady O
Clarissa B-PERSON
Shrimpton E-PERSON
| | O
but O
this O
distinguished O
lady O
, O
though O
she O
drove O
only B-CARDINAL
one E-CARDINAL
pony O
instead O
of O
four S-CARDINAL
horses O
, O
was O
considered O
by O
all O
the O
country O
round O
as O
the O
one S-CARDINAL
thing O
needful O
to O
render O
a O
party O
completely O
elegant O
. O
She O
was O
, O
indeed O
, O
neither O
young O
, O
handsome O
, O
nor O
rich O
, O
but O
she O
was O
Lady O
Clarissa S-PERSON
, O
and O
this O
was O
enough O
. O
The O
other O
exception O
was O
to O
be O
found O
in O
the O
rotund O
person O
of O
Dr. O
Crockley S-PERSON
, O
who O
having O
formerly O
been O
a O
celebrated O
quack O
, O
made O
a O
little O
fortune O
, O
and O
taken O
out O
a O
diploma O
, O
had O
lately O
married O
a O
beauty O
, O
and O
settled O
in O
the O
town O
of O
Ashleigh S-GPE
, O
where O
he O
was O
well O
pleased O
to O
pick O
up O
a O
few O
guinea O
fees O
, O
both O
as O
a O
public O
evidence O
of O
his O
being O
a O
real O
M.D. S-WORK_OF_ART
, O
and O
as O
a O
private O
fund O
wherewith O
to O
indulge O
his O
still O
very O
tender O
passion O
, O
by O
buying O
finery O
for O
his O
pretty O
young O
wife O
. O
This O
fat O
little O
gentleman O
was O
an O
especial O
favourite O
with O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
chiefly O
on O
account O
of O
his O
jocund O
humour O
and O
ready O
laugh O
| | O
and O
also O
, O
perhaps O
, O
because O
he O
had O
a O
pleasant O
way O
, O
peculiar O
to O
himself O
, O
of O
paying O
compliments O
in O
the O
bluntest O
and O
most O
unstudied O
manner O
possible O
. O
sputtering O
a O
little O
, O
but O
going O
out O
before O
it O
is O
able O
to O
communicate O
its O
light O
. O
The O
very O
sight O
of O
the O
servants O
as O
they O
panted O
round O
the O
table O
, O
was O
quite O
enough O
to O
smother O
and O
stifle O
all O
inclination O
for O
enjoyment O
— O
their O
shoes O
creaked O
— O
their O
faces O
shone O
— O
ice O
became O
water O
— O
the O
salad O
looked O
as O
if O
it O
were O
stewed O
— O
the O
cucumbers O
seemed O
to O
have O
fainted O
away O
— O
the O
prodigious O
turbot O
smelt O
fishy O
, O
and O
its O
attendant O
lobster O
- O
sauce O
glowed O
not O
with O
a O
deeper O
tint O
, O
than O
did O
my O
Lady O
Dowling's O
cheeks O
as O
her O
nose O
caught O
the O
unfragrant O
gale O
. O
In O
short O
, O
it O
was O
a O
great O
dinner O
in O
the O
dog O
- O
days O
, O
and O
no O
more O
need O
be O
said O
of O
it O
. O
Great O
was O
the O
inward O
satisfaction O
of O
every O
guest O
, O
when O
at O
last O
Lady B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
rose O
, O
and O
gave O
signal O
that O
the O
party O
was O
to O
be O
divided O
in O
half S-CARDINAL
. O
The O
languid O
ladies O
welcomed O
the O
coolness O
of O
the O
marble O
hall O
as O
they O
passed O
through O
it O
, O
and O
the O
gentlemen O
gazed O
eagerly O
at O
the O
butler O
as O
he O
brought O
forward O
a O
fresh O
supply O
of O
claret O
, O
and O
a O
reinforcement O
of O
ice O
. O
But O
the O
enjoyment O
of O
neither O
party O
lasted O
long O
| | O
for O
Lady B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
was O
too O
grand O
and O
too O
solemn O
not O
to O
marshal O
all O
her O
company O
into O
her O
fine O
drawing O
- O
room O
, O
where O
they O
were O
all O
ceremoniously O
deposited O
on O
satin O
sofas O
, O
amidst O
swelling O
pillows O
that O
might O
have O
defied O
the O
frosts O
of O
January S-DATE
| | O
while O
seven S-CARDINAL
or O
eight S-CARDINAL
hot O
- O
looking O
children O
were O
commanded O
to O
walk O
round O
the O
circle O
and O
kiss O
every O
body O
. O
Nor O
did O
the O
gentlemen O
fare O
much O
better O
| | O
for O
scarcely O
had O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
door O
closed O
after O
the O
ladies O
, O
before O
the O
shining O
baldhead O
of O
Dr. O
Crockley S-PERSON
stretched O
itself O
up O
nearly O
to O
a O
level O
with O
the O
long O
- O
backed O
Sir O
Matthew's S-PERSON
breast O
- O
pin O
, O
whilst O
, O
with O
a O
very O
ominous O
sort O
of O
growl O
, O
making O
itself O
heard O
before O
his O
lips O
opened O
, O
he O
first S-ORDINAL
preluded O
, O
and O
then O
uttered O
the O
following O
speech O
. O
" O
I O
don't O
like O
it O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
. O
— O
I O
don't O
like O
this O
business O
at O
the B-FAC
Weavers' I-FAC
Arms E-FAC
. O
" O
" O
What O
business O
, O
Doctor O
? O
" O
replied O
his O
friend O
sharply O
. O
" O
Why O
this O
meeting O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
. O
I O
can't O
get O
the O
notion O
of O
a O
strike O
out O
of O
my O
head O
. O
" O
Every O
chair O
was O
drawn O
towards O
the O
little O
doctor O
: O
nobody O
had O
heard O
a O
word O
of O
it O
. O
" O
Well O
, O
gentleman O
, O
perhaps O
I O
am O
mistaken O
— O
perhaps O
there O
has O
been O
no O
meeting O
, O
" O
resumed O
the O
friendly O
doctor O
. O
" O
God O
knows O
, O
I O
don't O
wish O
to O
spoil O
the O
enjoyment O
of O
this O
delightful O
hour O
| | O
but O
at O
any O
rate O
, O
my O
good O
friends O
, O
it O
is O
as O
well O
for O
you O
to O
be O
on O
the O
look O
- O
out O
. O
" O
Then O
lowering O
his O
voice O
, O
he O
muttered O
, O
as O
near O
to O
the O
ear O
of O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
as O
he O
could O
reach O
, O
" O
I O
know O
that O
your O
people O
are O
meeting O
, O
in O
doors O
and O
out O
of O
doors O
. O
But O
you O
are O
such O
a O
good O
, O
generous O
, O
kind O
- O
hearted O
creature O
, O
that O
I O
dare O
say O
we O
shall O
hear O
, O
before O
long O
, O
of O
your O
having O
done O
some O
d O
— O
d O
goodnatured O
thing O
or O
other O
, O
and O
that O
perhaps O
will O
set O
all O
right O
| | O
who O
knows O
? O
" O
believe O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
that O
my O
lady's O
coffee O
would O
do O
more O
to O
cool O
us O
than O
your O
wine O
. O
" O
The O
opinion O
was O
not O
opposed O
, O
and O
, O
much O
earlier O
than O
usual O
, O
the O
gentlemen O
rose O
, O
and O
followed O
the O
ladies O
. O
But O
this O
movement O
did O
not O
appear O
greatly O
to O
increase O
the O
enjoyment O
of O
either O
party O
. O
It O
was O
near O
nine B-TIME
o'clock E-TIME
, O
but O
the O
heat O
continued O
to O
be O
most O
oppressive O
, O
and O
the O
company O
being O
for O
the O
most O
part O
massive O
in O
all O
ways O
, O
their O
union O
produced O
more O
additional O
caloric O
than O
gaiety O
. O
The O
whole O
process O
seemed O
to O
have O
the O
power O
of O
turning O
the O
hours O
into O
molten O
lead O
as O
they O
passed O
, O
a O
portion O
of O
which O
appeared O
to O
drop O
, O
and O
weigh O
heavily O
on O
each O
individual O
head O
. O
In O
vain O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
made O
the O
circuit O
of O
the O
company O
, O
pausing O
in O
front O
either O
of O
the O
richest O
or O
handsomest O
ladies O
, O
as O
duty O
or O
inclination O
preponderated O
| | O
in O
vain O
he O
uttered O
his O
newest O
puns O
and O
freshest O
bon-mots O
— O
not O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
them O
had O
strength O
to O
laugh O
, O
beyond O
a O
little O
feeble O
" O
he O
, O
he O
! O
" O
and O
even O
that O
was O
evidently O
a O
painful O
effort O
. O
Things O
were O
in O
this O
state O
, O
when O
Lady O
Clarissa B-PERSON
Shrimpton E-PERSON
suddenly O
rose O
from O
the O
silken O
couch O
amidst O
whose O
pillows O
she O
was O
imbedded O
, O
and O
, O
without O
explaining O
her O
intentions O
to O
my O
Lady B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
, O
or O
any O
one O
else O
, O
darted O
through O
the O
open O
French S-NORP
- O
window O
, O
and O
out O
upon O
the O
well O
- O
shaven O
lawn O
. O
Had O
it O
been O
possible O
that O
any O
one O
in O
the O
room O
could O
have O
been O
ignorant O
of O
the O
rank O
of O
Lady O
Clarissa S-PERSON
, O
he O
must O
from O
that O
moment O
have O
felt O
an O
innate O
conviction O
that O
she O
was O
somebody O
| | O
for O
nobody O
that O
was O
not O
somebody O
could O
have O
ventured O
upon O
so O
daring O
an O
escapade O
from O
such O
a O
solemn O
presence O
- O
chamber O
. O
The O
effect O
it O
produced O
was O
electric O
. O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
darted O
across O
the O
room O
with O
the O
eagerness O
of O
a O
man O
of O
gallantry O
and O
gaiety O
. O
He O
piqued O
himself O
upon O
being O
, O
of O
all O
the O
great O
men O
in O
the O
neighbourhood O
, O
the O
one O
upon O
whom O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa E-PERSON
bestowed O
the O
most O
attention O
. O
His O
estimate O
of O
the O
outward O
advantages O
of O
his O
extensive O
person O
was O
indeed O
not O
a O
low O
one O
| | O
and O
, O
despite O
all O
his O
lady O
could O
do O
to O
crush O
such O
an O
odious O
idea O
, O
he O
was O
conscious O
that O
he O
was O
devoted O
to O
the O
fair O
sex O
, O
and O
flattered O
himself O
that O
the O
fair O
sex O
was O
not O
ungrateful O
. O
In O
fact O
, O
his O
general O
manner O
to O
ladies O
had O
a O
good O
deal O
of O
what O
in O
female O
slang O
is O
called O
swaining O
talent O
, O
pictorial O
talent O
, O
epigrammatic O
talent O
, O
every O
kind O
of O
talent O
, O
and O
it O
was O
certainly O
very O
delightful O
to O
be O
appreciated O
by O
such O
a O
superior O
creature O
as O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa E-PERSON
. O
So O
strongly O
indeed O
did O
this O
intellectual O
sympathy O
between O
them O
occasionally O
manifest O
itself O
, O
that O
not O
even O
the O
sharp O
elbows O
and O
red-tipped O
nose O
of O
the O
noble O
lady O
, O
who O
, O
to O
borrow O
the O
phrase O
of O
an O
inimitable O
describer O
, O
was O
in O
every O
sense O
" O
preter O
- O
blue O
perfect O
, O
" O
could O
render O
Lady B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
quite O
easy O
respecting O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
friendship O
. O
Nor O
was O
it O
without O
something O
like O
a O
pang O
that O
she O
marked O
the O
sudden O
alacrity O
of O
movement O
with O
which O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
now O
strode O
across O
the O
floor O
to O
accompany O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa E-PERSON
in O
the O
extraordinary O
frolic O
which O
led O
her O
, O
in O
white O
satin O
shoes O
and O
a O
gauze O
dress O
, O
to O
exchange O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
for O
the O
garden O
, O
at O
nine B-TIME
o'clock I-TIME
in I-TIME
the I-TIME
evening E-TIME
. O
But O
upon O
this O
occasion O
, O
as O
upon O
many O
others O
, O
Lady B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
found O
consolation O
in O
the O
well O
- O
known O
fact O
, O
that O
Lady O
Clarissa S-PERSON
rarely O
moved O
a O
step O
without O
being O
obsequiously O
attended O
by O
her O
humble O
companion O
, O
Miss O
Mogg S-PERSON
. O
This O
young O
lady O
had O
been O
selected O
to O
fill O
her O
present O
enviable O
situation O
, O
principally O
from O
her O
appearance O
, O
though O
she O
was O
indeed O
by O
no O
means O
void O
of O
many O
other O
qualifications O
admirably O
suited O
to O
it O
. O
But O
in O
appearance O
she O
was O
a O
striking O
contrast O
to O
her O
tall O
and O
slender O
patroness O
| | O
and O
, O
notwithstanding O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa's E-PERSON
mental O
superiority O
, O
she O
was O
not O
insensible O
to O
the O
advantage O
of O
having O
a O
foil O
that O
should O
set O
off O
the O
charms O
upon O
which O
she O
particularly O
prided O
herself O
. O
Lady O
Clarissa S-PERSON
had O
a O
thin O
, O
narrow O
foot O
, O
and O
an O
ancle O
that O
resembled O
nothing O
so O
much O
as O
the O
leg O
of O
a O
Robin S-PERSON
red- O
breast O
| | O
the O
person O
of O
Miss O
Mogg S-PERSON
was O
supported O
on O
shafts O
that O
told O
her O
Saxon S-NORP
origin O
, O
and O
feet O
that O
need O
not O
have O
shrunk O
from O
sustaining O
an O
ox O
. O
Lady O
Clarissa's S-PERSON
slender O
waist O
might O
have O
been O
encircled O
by O
a O
ring O
of O
six B-QUANTITY
inches I-QUANTITY
diameter E-QUANTITY
| | O
a O
cestus O
of O
nearly O
double O
the O
span O
had O
often O
gone O
nigh O
to O
suffocate O
her O
plump O
companion O
. O
The O
throat O
of O
Lady O
Clarissa S-PERSON
had O
not O
only O
all O
the O
flexile O
length O
of O
the O
swan's O
, O
but O
might O
even O
be O
said O
to O
resemble O
that O
of O
the O
stork O
in O
its O
proportions O
| | O
while O
the O
head O
of O
Miss O
Mogg S-PERSON
was O
separated O
from O
her O
shoulders O
by O
an O
interval O
so O
trifling O
, O
as O
hardly O
to O
be O
perceptible O
at O
all O
. O
The O
hair O
of O
her O
ladyship O
, O
though O
not O
very O
abundant O
, O
was O
as O
black O
as O
ink O
, O
and O
its O
straight O
nature O
enabled O
her O
to O
lay O
it O
in O
classic O
bands O
upon O
her O
forehead O
, O
furnishing O
a O
graceful O
foundation O
for O
the O
wreath O
of O
oak O
leaves O
with O
which O
, O
in O
judicious O
imitation O
of O
Domenichino's S-PERSON
exquisite O
head O
of O
Sappho S-PERSON
, O
she O
usually O
adorned O
herself O
when O
in O
full O
dress O
: O
while O
Miss O
Mogg S-PERSON
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
had O
a O
bushy O
abundance O
of O
flaxen O
curls O
, O
which O
gave O
a O
round O
fussy O
sort O
of O
contour O
to O
her O
face O
, O
that O
could O
not O
fail O
of O
setting O
off O
to O
advantage O
the O
severer O
outline O
of O
the O
noble O
lady O

and O
, O
in O
a O
word O
, O
the O
contrast O
was O
altogether O
perfect O
. O
general O
be O
found O
guilty O
of O
this O
scorn O
towards O
what O
is O
too O
lowly O
to O
turn O
, O
and O
scorn O
again O
, O
more O
especially O
was O
our O
knight O
liable O
to O
the O
weakness O

As O
he O
now O
hastened O
to O
offer O
his O
hand O
to O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa E-PERSON
in O
order O
to O
assist O
her O
in O
stepping O
over O
the O
window O
- O
sill O
, O
he O
very O
nearly O
overturned O
Miss O
Mogg S-PERSON
as O
he O
passed O
her O

but O
heeding O
neither O
the O
resistance O
her O
plump O
person O
offered O
to O
his O
passing O
elbow O

nor O
yet O
the O
timid O
" O
oh O
! O

which O
spoke O
her O
alarm O

he O
hurried O
onward O
, O
and O
, O
manfully O
seizing O
the O
hand O
whose O
touch O
was O
honor O

walked O
out O

" O
Only O

How O
very O
extraordinary O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
Lady B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
, O
suddenly O
rising O
, O
and O
addressing O
herself O
to O
no O
one O
in O

" O
Oh O
! O
how O
delightful O

cried O
several O

at O
once O

" O
How O

! O
Such O

" O
" O
To O
be O
sure O

it O
is O
the O
only O
thing O
in O
the O
world O
to O
do O
on O
such O
an O
evening O

this O

exclaimed O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON

who O
, O
as O
being O
the O
richest O
young O
lady O
in O
company O
, O
very O
properly O
thought O
she O
ought O
to O
speak O
first S-ORDINAL
. O
" O
I O
am O
sure O
I O
shall O
follow O
her O
example O

" O
and O
so O
saying O
, O
she O
rose O

walked O
towards O
the O
window O

Three S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
most O
dauntless O
ladies O
in O
the O
party O
started O
up O
to O
follow O
her O

which O
, O
strange O
as O
the O
manoeuvre O
appeared O
to O
the O
full O
- O
dressed O
Lady B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
, O
she O
did O
not O
oppose O

greatly O

that O
the O
garden O

the O

ones O
were O
stopped O
before O

accomplished O
their O

by O
a O
chorus O

it O
was O
not O

sense O
of O
propriety O

which O
, O
all O
things O
considered O

did O
her O

assure O
you O

my O

my O

that O
a O
short O
ramble O
in O

hardly O
a O

a O
freshness O

little O
poem O

so O
desirous O

introducing O

use O
her O
own O
words O
) O
" O
really O
very O
clever O
friend O

" O
had O
inscribed O
in O
her O
album O
. O
In O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
place O
it O
was O
the O
greatest O
possible O
relief O
to O
her O
lungs O
, O
for O
the O
lines O
she O
was O
reciting O
were O
much O
too O
full O
of O
deep O
feeling O
to O
be O
repeated O
without O
a O
painful O
effort O
, O
while O
walking O

and O
in O
the O
second S-ORDINAL
, O
the O
halt O
, O
accompanied O
as O
it O
was O
by O
a O
look O
of O
earnest O
attention O
from O
her O
apparently O
- O
delighted O
companion O
, O
furnished O
the O
most O
agreeable O
commentary O
in O
the O
world O
upon O
the O
poem O
itself O
, O
as O
well O
as O
on O
her O
manner O

reciting O
it O

said O
so O
plainly O
, O
" O

move O
not O

cadence O

really O
touched O

it O

Sawny S-PERSON

gardener O

his O
wife O

say O

think O

they O
would O
, O
neither O
peaches O

pines O
had O
any O
thing O
to O
do O
with O
the O
gratification O
she O
at O
this O
moment O
experienced O
in O
the O
society O
of O
the O
great O
manufacturer O
. O
His O
eyes O
were O
fixed O
on O
her O
face O
, O
and O
she O
bore O
the O
gaze O
, O
and O
returned O
it O
with O
that O
sort O
of O
courage O

confidence O
, O
which O
genuine O
enthusiasm O
alone O
can O
give O
. O
She O
had O
just O
finished O
a O
stanza O
when O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
ceased O
to O
move O
, O
and O
feeling O
that O
he O
did O
so O
under O
the O
influence O
of O
a O
spell O
, O
which O
she O
well O
knew O
would O
be O
more O
powerful O
still O

it O
spoken O
when O
she O
were O
at O
rest O
— O
for O
Lady O
Clarissa S-PERSON
was O
aware O
that O
she O
was O
exceedingly O
short O
- O
breathed O
— O
she O
repeated O
the O
last O
eight S-CARDINAL
lines O
in O
a O
manner O
that O
showed O
she O
felt O
the O
pleasure O
she O
was O
producing O
— O
a O
pleasure O
, O
as O
she O
thought O
, O
like O
that O
occasionally O
caused O
by O
the O
repetition O
of O
some O
delicious O
phrase O
in O
a O
musical O
composition O
, O
reiterated O
as O
if O
to O
fill O
the O
soul O
with O
its O
sweetness O

my O

livid O

that O

eye O

drop O
one S-CARDINAL
tear O

I'd O
hug O
my O
chain O

call O
it O

" O
The O
tear O
asked O
for O

almost O
came O
as O

ceased O
. O
" O
You O

it O

dear O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON

she O
said O

in O
a O
voice O
of O
considerable O
emotion O

hug O
my O
chain O

call O
it O

— O
she O
again O
murmured O
, O
hanging O
on O
his O
arm O
with O
such O
an O
evident O
degree O
of O
weakness O
, O
as O
showed O
the O
slender O
form O
to O
be O
less O
powerful O
than O
the O
ardent O
spirit O
it O
enshrined O
. O
" O
Let O
us O
turn O
back O

said O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON

" O
My O
dear O
friend O

faintly O
ejaculated O
Lady O
Clarissa S-PERSON
, O
" O
you O

too O
strongly O

no O

no O

Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON

Believe O
me O
, O
it O
were O
far O
better O
for O
both O
of O
us O

us O

state O

moment O

meet O
the O
curious O
stare O

idle O
eyes O

— O
Come O
on O
, O
dear O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
! O
" O
— O
and O
she O
gently O
pulled O
him O
forward O
as O
she O
spoke O
— O
" O
this O
soft O
glade O
invites O
us O
. O
" O
not O
to O
yield O
to O
the O
gentle O
violence O
which O
carried O
him O
forward O

, O
in O
what O
Lady O
Clarissa S-PERSON
felt O
to O
be O
very O
eloquent O
silence O
, O
he O
proceeded O
for O
a O
few O
steps O
farther O

Considerably O
, O
however O
, O
before O
they O
had O
reached O
the O
dreaded O
turning O
, O
his O
good O
star O
shot O
a O
ray O
upon O
him O
in O
the O
shape O
of O
a O
very O
large O
cow O
, O
with O
a O
pair O
of O
enormous O
horns O
, O
that O
slowly O
turned O
the O
corner O
, O
and O
fronted O
them O
. O
" O
Good O
heaven O
! O
" O
he O
exclaimed O
in O
an O
accent O
of O
great O
alarm O
. O
— O
" O
There O
is O
that O
horrid O
spotted O
cow O
! O

is O
the O
worst O
beast O

whole O
parish O

turn O
back O
instantly O

" O

kindly O
considerate O
! O

Lady O

you O
little O
know O
the O
strength O

your O
friend's O
mind O

Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
. O
Were O
I O
alone O
, O
indeed O
, O
I O
might O
tremble O

turn O
as O
pale O
as O
the O
veriest O
child O
that O
ever O
hid O
its O
face O

nurse's O
lap O

with O
you O

here O
the O
lady O
turned O
a O
very O
flattering O
glance O
on O
the O
athletic O
form O
of O
her O
protector O
— O
" O
Heaven O
knows O
, O
" O
replied O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
once O
more O
pressing O
her O
lean O
arm O
, O
" O
Heaven O
knows O

all O

undone O

consider O
the O
dog O

he O
added O
, O
pointing O
to O
a O
little O
cur O
that O
always O
followed O
him O

" O
its O
power O
of O
irritating O
an O
animal O
of O
this O
kind O
is O
quite O
extraordinary O
. O
" O
And O
as O
he O
spoke O
, O
he O
whistled O
in O
a O
note O
which O
meant O
, O
as O
his O
dog O
Spite O
knew O
as O
well O

he O
did O

resumed O
the O
knight O
, O
" O
it O

whistling O
to O
him O

" O
Obedient O
to O
the O
true O
meaning O
of O
the O
signal O

however O
, O
the O
dog O
sprang O
forward O

of O
course O
there O
ensued O
the O
scene O
which O
always O
follows O
on O
such O
occasions O

The O
dog O
yelped O
, O
and O
affected O
to O
spring O
at O
the O
nose O
of O
the O
cow O
, O
while O
she O
, O
somewhat O
accelerating O
her O
stately O
pace O
, O
threw O
up O
her O
tail O
, O
and O
bent O
down O
her O
head O
till O
her O
horns O
nearly O
touched O
the O
ground O
, O
offering O
so O
exact O
an O
image O
of O
" O
the O
cow O
with O
the O
crumpled O
horn O
, O
" O
with O
whose O
portrait O
her O
ladyship's O
early O
studies O
had O
made O
her O
familiar O
, O
that O
her O
confidence O
in O
the O
prowess O
of O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
could O
sustain O
her O
no O
longer O
, O
and O
she O
rapidly O
uttered O
a O
succession O
of O
tremendous O
screams O
. O
The O
purpose O
of O
the O
knight O
was O
accomplished O
, O
and O
he O
therefore O
indulged O
the O
fair O
lady O
by O
letting O
her O
scream O
on O
for O
at B-TIME
least I-TIME
a I-TIME
minute I-TIME
and I-TIME
a I-TIME
half E-TIME
, O
while O
he O
supported O
her O
with O
every O
appearance O
of O
the O
most O
pitying O
tenderness O
. O
Meanwhile O
, O
two S-CARDINAL
little O
boys O

who O
were O
making O
their O
way O
from O
the O
factory O
homewards O
, O
across O
a O
field O
by O
the O
side O
of O
the O
lane O
, O
ran O
with O
terrified O
curiosity O
, O

all O
the O
strength O
they O
had O
, O
to O
a O
gate O
, O
through O
which O
they O
could O
see O
the O
interesting O
spectacle O
of O
a O
fine O
full O
- O
dressed O
lady O
, O
screaming O
with O
all O
her O
might O
from O
between O
the O
sheltering O
arms O
of O
the O
magnificent O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON

a O
little O
dog O

an O
old O

starved O
cow O

" O
Come O
here O
, O
you O
young O
scamps O

cried O
the O
knight O

on O
perceiving O

over O

of O
the O
two S-CARDINAL

instantly O
obeyed O
this O

placing O
himself O
midway O
between O
the O
tormented O

the O
fair O
creature O
, O
whose O
nerves O
her O
menacing O
attitude O
had O
so O
cruelly O
shaken O
, O
he O
stood O
manfully O
astride O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O

flourished O
his O
ragged O

repeated O
at O
the O
top O
of O
his O
young O
voice O
, O
succeeded O
in O
turning O
the O
front O
of O
the O
enemy O
, O
which O
was O
presently O
seen O
to O
wheel O
round O

by O
a O

of O
feeble O

with O
very O
sentimental O
fervour O

could O

the O

most O
heartily O

inwardly O
cursing O

galled O
him O
for O
a O
moment O
so O
severely O

At O
the O
very O

moment O

as O
if O
to O
confirm O
his O
resolution O
, O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa E-PERSON
drew O
from O
her O
pocket O
a O
cambric O
pocket O

something O
the O
worse O

perhaps O

but O
most O
elaborately O
embroidered O
at O
each O
corner O
with O
the O
coronet O
of O
a O
countess O

It O
was O
one S-CARDINAL

work O

" O
Give O

honoured O

" O
Having O
said O
this O

he O
began O

might O

the O
delicate O

was O
shod O

" O
Please O
ma'am O

may O
I O
go O
and O
tell O
Teddy S-PERSON

" O
said O
little O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
walking O
after O
them O
. O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
during O
this O
most O
delightful O
walk O
, O
which O
convinced O
her O
that O
the O
knight O
, O
notwithstanding O
the O
homage O
he O
paid O
to O
her O
rank O
, O
could O
not O
wholly O
resist O
the O
fascinations O
of O
her O
person O
, O
talents O
, O
and O
manners O

— O
and O
the O
conviction O
pleased O
her O
. O
But O
let O
not O
the O
character O
of O
this O
noble O
lady O
be O
for O
a O
moment O
misunderstood O
. O
Lucretia S-PERSON
herself O
would O
hardly O
have O
shrunk O
with O
greater O
horror O
from O
an O
improper O
attachment O

All O
she O
dreamed O
of O
in O
her O
intimacy O
with O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
, O
with O
the O
young O
poet O
, O
Osmund B-PERSON
Norval E-PERSON
, O
and O
with O
a O
few O
other O
gentlemen O
whom O
she O
was O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
meeting O
, O
was O
but O
that O
their O
admiring O
friendship O
should O
be O
animated O
by O
a O
lambent O
, O
innoxious O
flickering O
of O
the O
flame O
, O
which O
, O
after O
a O
peculiar O
theory O
of O
her O
own O
, O
she O
believed O
to O
pervade O
the O
universe O
, O
cheering O
the O
well O

conducted O
by O
its O
mild O
platonic O
warmth O
, O

scorching O
, O
burning O
, O
and O
destroying O
those O
who O
permitted O
it O
to O
exercise O
over O
them O
a O
too O
- O
sovereign O
sway O
and O
masterdom O

That O
she O
had O
reached O
the O
age O
of O
forty S-DATE
, O
unsolicited O
in O
marriage O
by O
any O
suitor O
of O
any O
degree O
, O
she O
attributed O
, O
rightly O
enough O
perhaps O
, O
to O
the O
unfortunate O
disproportion O
between O
her O
fortune O
and O
her O
rank O
— O
but O
must O
she O
, O
therefore O
, O
live O
and O
die O
without O
the O
sweet O
consciousness O
of O
having O
been O
loved O
? O
Where O
was O
the O
law O
that O
enforced O
such O
cruelty O
? O
She O
knew O
it O
not O

accordingly O
had O
, O
for O
many B-DATE
years E-DATE
, O

quite O
upon O
principle O
, O
made O
up O
her O
mind O
to O
permit O
as O
many O
gentlemen O
, O
of O
all O
ages O

ranks O

conditions O

to O
deserve O
" O
the O
soft O
impeachment O

" O
whether O
they O
owned O
it O

not O

as O
it O
was O
in O
her O
power O
to O
captivate O

For O
most O
of O
these O
tender O

really O
very O
innocent O
friendships O
, O
she O
was O
able O
to O
assign O
to O
herself O
some O
excellent O
cause O
— O
as O
poetical O
sympathy O
with O
one O

botanical O
sympathy O
with O
another O

philosophical O
religious O
sympathy O
with O
a O
third S-ORDINAL

so O
on O

but O
in O
the O
case O
of O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
, O
she O
sometimes O
felt O
a O
little O
puzzled O
herself O
. O
It O
was O
not O
, O
however O
, O
that O
she O
was O
weak O
enough O
in O
the O
least O
degree O
to O
blame O
herself O
for O
wishing O
to O
be O
admired O
by O
a O
vulgar O
man O
. O
She O
had O
long O
ago O
given O
such O
feelings O
to O
the O
winds O
. O
From O
the O
time O
she O
quitted O
, O
on O
the O
death O
of O
her O
mother O
, O
the O
floods O
and O
the O
fells O
of O
her O
native O
land O
, O
to O
inhabit O
a O
pretty O
little O
cottage O
( O
the O
timely O
gift O
of O
an O
English S-LANGUAGE
godmother O
) O
, O
which O
happened O
to O
be O
situated O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
a O
manufacturing O
district O
, O
she O
had O
been O
schooling O
her O
spirit O
to O
endure O
the O
change O
from O
poor O
lairds O
of O
a O
hundred S-CARDINAL
descents O
, O
to O
rich O
manufacturers O
, O
who O
would O
have O
been O
, O
for O
the O
most O
part O
, O
quite O
as O
pleased O
had O
they O
been O
unable O
to O
trace O
one O
. O
Just O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
, O
her O
Scotch S-NORP
pride O
rebelled O
a O
little O
| | O
but O
an O
hour O
or O
two S-CARDINAL
of O
quiet O
meditation O
on O
the O
subject O
, O
led O
her O
to O
perceive O
so O
clearly O
all O
she O
might O
lose O
, O
and O
all O
she O
might O
gain O
, O
by O
being O
or O
not O
being O
on O
friendly O
terms O
with O
her O
neighbours O
, O
that O
she O
made O
up O
her O
mind O
on O
the O
matter O
at O
once O
, O
and O
thenceforward O
feasted O
upon O
delicate O
cates O
, O
and O
battened O
in O
the O
fructifying O
sunshine O
of O
universal O
popularity O
, O
in O
a O
neighbourhood O
that O
might O
be O
safely O
described O
as O
the O
richest O
in O
the O
world O
. O
celebrated O
for O
the O
warmth O
of O
his O
devotion O
to O
the O
fair O
sex O
. O
But O
for O
this O
, O
she O
must O
not O
be O
out O
of O
measure O
blamed O
, O
inasmuch O
as O
those O
who O
have O
reached O
the O
age O
for O
looking O
on O
upon O
the O
drama O
of O
life O
, O
can O
many O
of O
them O
testify O
that O
in O
this O
she O
only O
yielded O
to O
a O
weakness O
very O
unaccountably O
common O
to O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
sex O
. O
But O
poor O
little O
Michael B-PERSON
Armstrong E-PERSON
has O
been O
left O
unmercifully O
long O
, O
looking O
up O
in O
her O
ladyship's O
smiling O
face O
, O
as O
she O
inquired O
who O
Teddy S-PERSON

" O
Teddy S-PERSON

my O
brother O

ma'am O

was O
his O
answer O

" O

he O
still O
waiting O
for O
you O
at O
the O
gate O

my O

can't O
stand O

lame O

Michael S-PERSON

" O
I O
shouldn't O
wonder O
if O
he O
was O
set O
down O

gone O

sleep O

it O

hardly O
bedtime O

it O

I O

better O
go O

Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON

Your O
brother O

again O
to O
the O
child O

" O

younger O

are O

I O
suppose O

if O
he O
falls O
asleep O
on O
the O
grass O

a O
baby O

Is O
he O
old O
enough O
to O
go O
home O

tell O
the O
great O
news O

only O
he O
is O
always O
so O
tired O

replied O
the O
boy O
. O
" O
Well O
, O
then O
, O
just O
step O
back O
, O
and O
bid O
him O
run O
along O
home O
by O
himself O

all O
the O

what O
a O
fine O
act O
you O
have O
done O

that O

" O
Michael S-PERSON
now O
, O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
, O
ventured O
to O
look O
steadily O
up O
into O
the O
face O
of O
the O
majestic O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
and O
his O
little O
heart O
sank O
within O
him O
. O
It O
was O
quite O
evident O
from O
the O
child's O
speaking O
- O
countenance O
, O
that O
no O
pleasurable O
ideas O
were O
suggested O
, O
by O
the O
assurance O
that O
Sir O

take O
care O

him O
all O
the O
rest O
of O

The O
knight O
saw O
this O
, O
and O
would O
for O
a O
moment O
have O
desired O
no O
better O
sport O
than O
wringing O
his O
neck O
round O

nevertheless O
, O
he O
patted O
his O
head O
with O
astonishing O
condescension O
, O
and O
said O
, O
" O

answered O
Michael S-PERSON

while O
a O
slight O
flash O
mantled O
his O
pale O
cheek O

something O

a O
tear O
twinkled O
in O
his O
eye O

said O
the O

rather O
indignantly O

The O
little O

" O
" O
Not O
very O
, O
" O
said O
the O
child O
. O
" O
Poor O
little O
fellow O
! O
— O
It O
is O
quite O
evident O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
that O
he O
is O
exceedingly O
shy O
. O
Let O
us O
go O
back O
, O
shall O
we O
? O
— O
just O
as O
far O
as O
the O
gate O
, O
and O
give O
the O
message O
ourselves O
to O
that O
lazy O
fellow O
that O
he O
says O
is O
asleep O
under O
the O
hedge O
— O
and O
two B-DATE
years I-DATE
older E-DATE
than O
this O
one O
. O
— O
Only O
conceive O
! O
— O
I O
am O
delighted O
that O
he O
is O
not O
to O
be O
the O
object O
of O
your O
bounty O
, O
for O
there O
is O
nothing O
so O
detestable O
as O
idleness O
. O
" O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
had O
turned O
in O
compliance O
with O
the O
word O
and O
action O
, O
which O
expressed O
her O
ladyship's O
desire O
that O
he O
should O
do O
so O
, O
and O
in O
another B-TIME
minute E-TIME
they O
reached O
the O
gate O
. O
" O
Where O
is O
this O
brother O
of O
yours O
? O
— O
I O
don't O
see O
him O
, O
" O
said O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa E-PERSON
, O
looking O
about O
. O
" O
There O
he O
is O
, O
ma'am O
, O
if O
you O
please O
, O
" O
replied O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
once O
more O
climbing O
over O
the O
gate O
| | O
and O
presently O
he O
was O
close O
under O
the O
flowery O
hedge O
, O
extending O
his O
two S-CARDINAL
hands O
to O
raise O
a O
miserably O
sicklooking O
child O
, O
who O
was O
, O
in O
truth O
, O
soundly O
sleeping O
there O
. O
In O
consequence O
of O
a O
few O
words O
whispered O
to O
him O
by O
little O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
the O
boy O
came O
forward O
with O
a O
shuffling O
gait O
, O
his O
knees O
sloping O
inwards O
, O
and O
his O
legs O
frightfully O
emaciated O
: O
but O
the O
moment O
he O
reached O
the O
gate O
, O
Lady O
Clarissa S-PERSON
exclaimed O
, O
" O
Good O
gracious O
! O
how O
beautiful O
! O
" O
It O
was O
indeed O
a O
lovely O
face O
that O
was O
then O
turned O
up O
to O
meet O
her O
eye O
| | O
and O
when O
, O
as O
if O
somewhat O
daunted O
by O
her O
earnest O
gaze O
, O
he O
removed O
his O
own O
from O
her O
countenance O
to O
that O
of O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
the O
bright O
flash O
that O
lighted O
it O
up O
for O
a O
moment O
made O
it O
appear O
more O
beautiful O
still O
. O
" O
And O
what O
is O
your O
name O
, O
my O
pretty O
boy O
? O
" O
said O
the O
lady O
. O
" O
Edward B-PERSON
Armstrong E-PERSON
, O
" O
was O
the O
reply O
. O
" O
But O
, O
my O
dear O
child O
, O
you O
don't O
look O
well O
, O
and O
you O
ought O
not O
to O
go O
to O
sleep O
so O
, O
quite O
late O
in O
the O
evening O
, O
upon O
the O
grass O
. O
What O
makes O
you O
so O
very O
sleepy O
, O
my O
dear O
? O
Have O
you O
been O
at O
play O
? O
" O
" O
No O
, O
ma'am O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
boy O
, O
furtively O
glancing O
at O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
" O
I O
have O
been O
at O
work O
. O
" O
" O
At O
work O
! O
You O
can't O
have O
done O
much O
work O
, O
my O
poor O
little O
fellow O
, O
looking O
as O
you O
do O
. O
" O
" O
I O
have O
been O
at O
work O
since O
" O
— O
off O
, O
and O
I O
am O
sure O
you O
will O
be O
quite O
chilled O
if O
you O
remain O
any O
longer O
out O
of O
doors O
. O
" O
" O
I O
believe O
you O
are O
right O
, O
my O
dear O
friend O
, O
" O
said O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa E-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
glance O
of O
affectionate O
gratitude O
for O
this O
earnest O
zeal O
. O
" O
Let O
us O
go O
. O
Never O
can O
I O
forget O
the O
kindness O
you O
have O
shown O
me O
during O
this O
eventful O
walk O
, O
and O
heartless O
indeed O
must O
I O
be O
were O
I O
to O
refuse O
to O
acknowledge O
that O
it O
has O
made O
a O
deep O
impression O
on O
me O
. O
" O
For O
a O
moment O
Lady O
Clarissa S-PERSON
held O
her O
coroneted O
handkerchief O
to O
her O
eyes O
, O
and O
then O
resumed O
. O
" O
Go O
home O
, O
little O
Edward S-PERSON
— O
tell O
your O
mother O
, O
who O
, O
by O
the O
by O
, O
I O
trust O
is O
not O
harsh O
to O
you O
, O
that O
your O
brother O
Michael S-PERSON
is O
rewarded O
for O
an O
act O
of O
bravery O
that O
probably O
saved O
the O
life O
of O
an O
earl's O
daughter O
— O
has O
been O
most O
generously O
and O
nobly O
adopted O
by O
her O
friend O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
, O
and O
that O
henceforward O
she O
need O
have O
no O
anxiety O
whatever O
on O
his O
account O
. O
Now O
, O
then O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
I O
am O
ready O
. O
" O
" O
Are O
we O
never O
to O
see O
Michael S-PERSON
again O
? O
" O
said O
the O
lame O
boy O
, O
while O
a O
sudden O
expression O
of O
anguish O
passed O
across O
his O
beautiful O
features O
. O
" O
Why O
not O
, O
child O
? O
" O
replied O
her O
ladyship O
rather O
sharply O
. O
" O
Do O
you O
suppose O
that O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
and O
I O
are O
going O
to O
hide O
him O
? O
" O
" O
It O
is O
all O
very O
well O
then O
, O
" O
returned O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
limping O
away O
. O
" O
But O
be O
sure O
to O
go O
and O
tell O
mother O
all O
about O
it O
yourself O
to O
- O
morrow O
, O
Mike S-PERSON
. O
" O
" O
Come O
along O
, O
little O
one O
! O
" O
said O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa E-PERSON
, O
moving O
off O
. O
" O
Follow O
behind O
this O
generous O
gentleman O
, O
and O
see O
the O
palace O
of O
a O
home O
which O
your O
bravery O
has O
won O
. O
" O
So O
saying O
, O
she O
moved O
on O
| | O
the O
obsequious O
knight O
at O
her O
side O
, O
and O
the O
wondering O
Michael B-PERSON
Armstrong E-PERSON
after O
her O
. O
On O
reaching O
the O
gate O
beside O
the O
gardener's O
house O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
paused O
. O
He O
had O
been O
meditating O
, O
while O
seemingly O
listening O
in O
rapt O
attention O
to O
the O
lady's O
talk O
, O
on O
the O
effect O
which O
would O
be O
produced O
on O
the O
party O
they O
were O
about O
to O
rejoin O
, O
by O
the O
appearance O
of O
the O
ragged O
little O
companion O
they O
had O
brought O
back O
with O
them O
. O
Had O
he O
been O
a O
ragged O
sailor O
- O
boy O
, O
or O
a O
ragged O
plough O
- O
boy O
, O
or O
even O
a O
ragged O
chimney O
- O
sweeper O
, O
there O
might O
by O
possibility O
have O
been O
excited O
some O
feeling O
of O
curiosity O
and O
interest O
| | O
but O
a O
ragged O
factory O
- O
boy O
was O
of O
all O
created O
beings O
the O
one O
least O
likely O
to O
give O
birth O
to O
such O
emotions O
, O
among O
his O
friends O
and O
neighbours O
, O
or O
indeed O
to O
any O
other O
emotion O
fit O
to O
be O
exhibited O
in O
good O
society O
. O
So O
, O
merely O
saying O
to O
his O
fair O
friend O
, O
" O
Excuse O
me O
, O
my O
lady O
, O
for O
one S-CARDINAL
moment O
, O
" O
he O
once O
more O
knocked O
at O
the O
cottage O
- O
window O
, O
and O
called O
aloud O
for O
" O
Macnab S-PERSON
! O
" O
The O
obedient O
North B-NORP
Briton E-NORP
appeared O
immediately O
, O
and O
was O
about O
to O
forestal O
the O
inquiry O
he O
anticipated O
by O
assurances O
that O
her O
ladyship's O
pines O
, O
peaches O
, O
and O
grapes O
, O
had O
all O
been O
consigned O
to O
the O
care O
of O
her O
ladyship's O
own O
serving O
- O
man O
, O
when O
he O
was O
very O
literally O
struck O
dumb O
by O
his O
master O
saying O
— O
Observe O
, O
Macnab S-PERSON
, O
and O
take O
care O
, O
if O
you O
please O
, O
that O
all O
the O
servants O
about O
the O
place O
know O
it O
, O
that O
this O
boy O
is O
to O
be O
the O
object O
of O
the O
greatest O
benevolence O
. O
" O
" O
The O
greatest O
— O
what O
was O
you O
pleased O
to O
say O
, O
sir O
? O
" O
said O
the O
Scotch S-PERSON
gardener O
, O
really O
and O
truly O
doubting O
his O
own O
ears O
. O
" O
Benevolence O
, O
sir O
! O
" O
shouted O
the O
knight O
vehemently O
| | O
" O
and O
woe O
to O
any O
one O
on O
my O
estate O
who O
dares O
to O
question O
or O
thwart O
my O
design O
! O
" O
" O
How O
inspiring O
is O
this O
angelic O
goodness O
, O
" O
exclaimed O
Lady O
Clarissa S-PERSON
affectionately O
. O
" O
Ah O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
! O
how O
few O
there O
are O
who O
know O
you O
as O
I O
know O
you O
! O
" O
" O
Come O
along O
, O
my O
man O
, O
" O
said O
the O
Scotchman S-PERSON
, O
leading O
away O
Michael S-PERSON
| | O
and O
he O
said O
no O
more O
till O
he O
was O
quite O
sure O
that O
the O
knight O
and O
the O
lady O
had O
got O
far O
enough O
in O
their O
progress O
across O
the O
garden O
, O
to O
be O
out O
of O
hearing O
, O
and O
then O
he O
added O
: O
" O
And O
now O
, O
my O
little O
fellow O
, O
tell O
me O
in O
God's O
name O
what O
all O
this O
means O
? O
Why O
, O
you O
look O
for O
all O
the O
world O
like O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
little O
raggamuffins O
out O
of O
the O
factory O
. O
" O
" O
I O
am O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
raggamuffins O
out O
of O
the O
factory O
, O
" O
replied O
Michael S-PERSON
. O
" O
You O
are O
? O
and O
our O
master's O
going O
to O
make O
a O
house O
- O
pet O
of O
ye O
? O
Why O
, O
now O
, O
you'll O
be O
made O
the O
talk O
of O
the O
whole O
country O
. O
I O
should O
not O
have O
been O
one O
- O
half O
so O
much O
surprised O
if O
he O
had O
taken O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
our O
sucking O
pigs O
into O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
. O
" O
" O
Nor O
I O
, O
sir O
, O
" O
said O
Michael S-PERSON
timidly O
, O
but O
with O
half S-CARDINAL
a O
smile O
. O
" O
So O
, O
then O
, O
you O
don't O
understand O
it O
much O
better O
than O
I O
do O
, O
it O
seems O
? O
But O
what O
did O
he O
say O
it O
was O
for O
? O
He O
didn't O
take O
the B-PERSON
Earl I-PERSON
of I-PERSON
Highlandloch's E-PERSON
daughter O
among O
the O
infernal O
whirligigs O
, O
did O
he O
, O
and O
pick O
you O
out O
as O
a O
specimen O
to O
be O
kept O
in O
a O
glass O
case O
? O
" O
" O
I O
hope O
he O
won't O
put O
me O
in O
a O
glass O
case O
, O
sir O
, O
" O
said O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
taking O
courage O
from O
the O
gardener's O
good O
- O
humour O

" O
but O
why O
he O
brought O
me O
here O
at O
all O
, O
I O
don't O
very O
well O
understand O
. O
The O
lady O
said O
it O
was O
because O
I O
held O
up O
my O
hat O
, O
and O
cried O
' O
Wough S-PERSON
! O
' O
to O
Dame B-PERSON
Knight's E-PERSON
old O
cow O
: O
but O
of O
course O
she O
was O
only O
making O
fun O
. O
" O
" O
At O
any O
rate O
, O
he O
was O
making O
no O
fun O
, O
for O
he O
roared O
like O
a O
bulldog O
, O
didn't O
he O
? O
So O
his O
bidding O
I'll O
do O
, O
let O
it O
mean O
what O
it O
will O

and O
if O
it O
brings O
you O
food O
and O
lodging O
, O
I O
don't O
suppose O
you'll O
break O
your O
heart O
for O
being O
taken O
out O
of O
the O
factory O
— O
shall O
you O
? O
" O
" O
Not O
if O
he'll O
take O
Edward S-PERSON
out O
too O

said O
the O
boy O

" O

When O
Mr. O
Macnab S-PERSON
and O
his O
little O
companion O
entered O
the O
kitchen O
, O
in O
their O
way O
to O
the O
servants' O
hall O
, O
to O
which O
place O
of O
honour O
the O
wondering O
Scotchman S-PERSON
remembered O
he O
had O
been O
commanded O
to O
conduct O
his O
charge O
, O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
person O
they O
encountered O
was O
Mr. O
Simkins S-PERSON
, O
the O
butler O
, O
whom O
some O
accidental O
wish O
or O
want O
had O
led O
to O
enter O
a O
region O

rarely O
honoured O
by O
the O
sunshine O
of O
his O
presence O
. O
" O
Good O
morning O
, O
Macnab S-PERSON

What O
! O
empty O

handed O
? O
I O
am O
afraid O
you O
have O
forgotten O
the O
little O
basket O
of O
peaches O
I O
desired O
to O
have O
| | O
and O
upon O
my O
word O
, O
sir O
, O
if O
you O
leave O
it O
much O
longer O
, O
I O
shall O
not O
consider O
them O
worth O
presenting O
to O
the O
lady O
for O
whom O
I O
desired O
to O
have O
them O
. O
Be O
pleased O
to O
recollect O
, O
good O
Mr. O
Sawney S-PERSON
, O
that O
when O
every O
garden O

is O
hung O
with O
ripe O
fruit O
, O
a O
bottle O
of O
comfort O

be O
rather O
too O
high O

price O
for O
a B-CARDINAL
dozen E-CARDINAL

" O
" O
Your O
discourse O
, O
Mr. O
Simkins S-PERSON
, O
is O
neither O
civil O

discreet O
in O
any O
way O

replied O
the O
offended O
North B-NORP
Briton E-NORP
: O
" O
my O
word O
, O

rank O
as O
a O
butler O

Mr. O
Simkins S-PERSON

suspect O

" O
Well O

that's O
all O

But O
who O
in O

you O

more O

am O
able O

Macnab S-PERSON

" O
All O
I O
know O
about O

mystery O

Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON

that O
was O
hardly O
born O
to O
be O
so O
free O
in O
his O
company O

came O
to O

about B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour I-TIME
ago E-TIME
, O
and O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
was O
as O
gay O
as O

ambled O

the O
Highlandloch's S-PERSON
daughter O

old O
fool O

gallanted O
by O
the B-PERSON
Duke I-PERSON
of I-PERSON
Argyle E-PERSON
. O
Well O
, O
sir O

ordered O
a O
basket O
of O
the O
choicest O

best O
for O
her O
ladyship O
, O
and O
it O
went O
against O
me O
, O
Mr. O
Simkins S-PERSON
, O
both O
ways O
— O
for O
first S-ORDINAL
it O
ought O
to O
choke O
her O

seeing O
who O
she O

who O

next O
I O
thought O

However O

nevertheless O
, O
Mr. O

, O
I O
will O
keep O
my O

you O

all O

away O

away O

eager O
to O

that O
by O
the O
time O
Mr. O

himself O
returned O
to O

all O
of O

were O
gazing O
at O
little O
Michael S-PERSON

very O
much O
as O
if O
he O
had O
been O
caught O
in O
a O

conveyed O
thither O

" O
Who O

that O
dirty O
little O
boy O

Macnab S-PERSON

" O
said O
the O
magnificent O
Mrs. O
Thompson S-PERSON
, O
advancing O
to O
the O
spot O
where O
the O
gardener O
was O
seated O
with O
his O
frightened O
charge O
standing O
beside O
him O

all O
the O
lookers O

on O
making O
way O
for O
her O

passed O

forestalling O

it O
may O
be O
, O
the O
storm O

enjoy O
the O
fun O

But O
he O
was O
, O
as O
it O
should O
seem O
, O
mistaken O
as O
to O
Mrs. O

feelings O

for O
that O
lady O
, O
though O
usually O
considered O
by O
the O
subordinates O
as O
somewhat O
warm O
in O
temper O
, O
appeared O
on O
this O
occasion O

mild O

a O
lamb O

" O
A O

she O
replied O
with O
the O
dignity O
that O
was O
peculiar O
to O
her O

its O
millions S-CARDINAL

out O

with O
their O
millions S-CARDINAL
of O
cotton O

that O
is O
not O
the O
main O
point O

the O
question O

Mr. O

: O
it O
is O
not O
what O
the O
boy O

who O
he O
is O
, O

for O
what O

dared O
to O

" O

the O
gardener O

very O
grave O

continued O
Macnab S-PERSON

raising O
his O
voice O
, O
on O
perceiving O
that O
the O
stately O
housekeeper O

putting O
herself O
in O
act O
to O
speak O

" O
Sir O

on O

his O
arm O

something O

isn't O
it O

" O
" O
Sir O

may O
settle O
about O

when O
he O
is O
in O
his O
own O
pew O
at O
church O

" O
replied O
Mrs. O
Thompson S-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
very O
satirical O
sort O
of O
smile O

" O

most O
certainly O
it O
shall O
not O

, O
ma'am O

Mrs. O

, O
you O
had O
better O
stop O

you O

if O
that's O
your O
answer O

tell O
Sir O

of O
it O

" O
in O
the O
British S-NORP
dominions O

assumed O
the O
aspect O

fury O

" O
' O
Tis O
two S-CARDINAL
, O
too O
bad O

that's O
the O
fact O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
my O
Lady B-PERSON
Dowling's E-PERSON
own O
footman O
, O
who O
always O
sided O
with O
the O
principal O
person O
in O
company O
, O
which O
gave O
him O
very O
much O
the O
air O
of O
being O
a O
superior O
person O
himself O
| | O
" O
and O
if O
I O
was O
Mrs. O
Thompson S-PERSON
, O
I'd O
throw O
my O
salary O
in O
the O
vulgar O
fellow's O
face O
, O
before O
I'd O
bear O
to O
have O
a O
factory O
- O
boy O
pushed O
into O
my O
company O
. O
" O
" O
And O
so O
I O
will O
, O
Mr. O
Jennings S-PERSON
, O
you O
may O
depend O
upon O
it O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
incensed O
prime O
ministeress O
, O
somewhat O
softened O
: O
" O
so O
now O
, O
Mr. O
Macnab S-PERSON
, O
you O
may O
just O
take O
yourself O
off O
, O
and O
leave O
the O
brat O
in O
the O
kitchen O
, O
or O
take O
him O
away O
with O
you O
, O
as O
you O
like O
best O
. O
" O
" O
I O
have O
done O
my O
share O
of O
the O
benevolent O
job O
, O
so O
I O
will O
wish O
you O
good O
night O
, O
Mrs. O
Thompson S-PERSON
| | O
and O
whether O
this O
little O
fellow O
eats O
his O
supper O
and O
breakfast O
in O
the O
kitchen O
or O
the O
hall O
, O
it O
will O
be O
much O
the O
same O
to O
him O
, O
I O
fancy O
. O
" O
So O
saying O
, O
the O
gardener O
rose O
, O
and O
giving O
a O
sort O
of O
general O
nod O
to O
the O
company O
, O
left O
the O
kitchen O
. O
Considering O
that O
there O
had O
been O
nothing O
very O
affectionate O
in O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
intercourse O
which O
had O
taken O
place O
between O
them O
, O
it O
was O
rather O
singular O
that O
the O
little O
Michael S-PERSON
should O
feel O
as O
sorry O
as O
he O
did O
at O
the O
departure O
of O
Mr. O
Macnab S-PERSON
. O
But O
he O
did O
feel O
sorry O
, O
and O
when O
the O
door O
shut O
after O
him O
, O
he O
turned O
away O
, O
and O
hid O
his O
face O
with O
his O
uplifted O
arm O
. O
Pride O
of O
place O
, O
and O
elevation O
of O
character O
, O
having O
been O
in O
a O
considerable O
degree O
satisfied O
by O
Mrs. O
Thompson's S-PERSON
energetic O
expression O
of O
her O
feelings O
, O
something O
like O
curiosity O
awoke O
within O
her O
to O
learn O
what O
the O
circumstances O
had O
been O
which O
had O
induced O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
to O
declare O
an O
intention O
of O
acting O
benevolently O
. O
For O
a O
moment O
she O
struggled O
against O
it O
, O
and O
again O
seemed O
about O
to O
leave O
the O
room O
| | O
but O
as O
she O
turned O
her O
eyes O
upon O
the O
child O
, O
she O
seemed O
to O
feel O
that O
before O
one O
so O
very O
abject O
, O
no O
loss O
of O
importance O
could O
be O
feared O
, O
even O
if O
she O
did O
question O
him O
. O
So O
, O
with O
the O
air O
of O
a O
judge O
walking O
up O
to O
the O
bench O
, O
she O
stalked O
onwards O
to O
the O
seat O
Mr. O
Macnab S-PERSON
had O
left O
, O
and O
placing O
her O
austere O
person O
in O
it O
, O
made O
a O
signal O
with O
her O
hand O
, O
that O
the O
kitchen O
- O
maid O
who O
had O
ventured O
to O
approach O
the O
little O
boy O
should O
stand O
back O
, O
and O
leave O
her O
space O
to O
examine O
him O
. O
of O
this O
extraordinary O
scene O
, O
might O
be O
punished O
with O
as O
little O
suffering O
as O
possible O
. O
Two S-CARDINAL
sprightly O
housemaids O
seemed O
to O
find O
something O
vastly O
amusing O
in O
the O
whole O
business O
, O
though O
their O
evident O
merriment O
was O
restrained O
by O
the O
solemnity O
of O
Mrs. O
Thompson's S-PERSON
manner O
. O
" O
Look O
up O
in O
my O
face O
, O
little O
boy O
, O
" O
said O
the O
housekeeper O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
she O
had O
seated O
herself O
and O
saw O
that O
those O
around O
her O
stood O
still O
, O
as O
if O
they O
had O
taken O
their O
places O
, O
and O
were O
prepared O
to O
listen O
. O
Michael S-PERSON
did O
not O
move O
| | O
he O
was O
probably O
ashamed O
to O
show O
that O
he O
was O
weeping O
, O
before O
the O
face O
of O
a O
lady O
who O
spoke O
so O
very O
grandly O
. O
The O
kitchen O
- O
maid O
gave O
him O
a O
nudge O
, O
but O
a O
gentle O
one O
, O
whispering O
at O
the O
same O
time O
— O
" O
Look O
up O
, O
my O
boy O
. O
What O
be O
you O
' O
feard O
of O
? O
There's O
nobody O
as O
wants O
to O
hurt O
you O
here O
. O
" O
Thus O
encouraged O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
let O
his O
arm O
drop O
by O
his O
side O
, O
and O
discovered O
a O
face O
that O
was O
indeed O
sallow O
, O
and O
by O
no O
means O
very O
plump O
, O
but O
with O
features O
and O
expression O
which O
, O
whatever O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling's E-PERSON
men O
and O
maids O
might O
think O
of O
it O
, O
might O
have O
sufficed O
to O
make O
the O
fortune O
of O
an O
able O
painter O
. O
" O
Whose O
child O
are O
you O
? O
" O
demanded O
the O
housekeeper O
. O
" O
Mother's O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
boy O
. O
" O
I O
suspected O
as O
much O
, O
" O
rejoined O
the O
inquisitor O
, O
half S-CARDINAL
aside O
to O
Mr. O
Jennings S-PERSON
. O
" O
And O
I O
beant O
no O
ways O
surprised O
to O
hear O
it O
, O
I O
promise O
you O
, O
" O
he O
replied O
. O
Mrs. O
Thompson S-PERSON
sighed O

Then O
, O
after O
taking O
a O
moment O
to O
recover O
herself O
, O
she O
resumed O
, O
" O
And O
where O
does O
the O
unhappy O
person O
live O
? O
" O
" O
Please O

ma'am O

the O
puzzled O
boy O

upon O
you O
for O
forcing O
me O

" O
Michael S-PERSON
gave O
a O
little O
shake O
of O
the O
head O
, O
which O
seemed O
to O
the O
merciful O
kitchen O
- O
maid O
to O
say O
, O
that O
he O
did O
not O
know O
what O
the O
great O
lady O
meant O

but O
he O
presently O
replied O
, O
as O
if O
discreetly O
determined O
to O
mind O
only O
what O
he O
did O
understand O
, O
" O
Mother O

Hoxley B-GPE

" O

most O
deplorable O
situation O

only O
by O
the O
very O
lowest O
! O
" O
observed O
the O
housekeeper O
, O
with O
another O
indignant O
sigh O
. O
" O
So O
much O
the O
worse O
for O
she O
, O
" O
muttered O
the O
kitchen O
- O
maid O

but O
not O
loud O
enough O
to O
be O
heard O
by O
her O
in O
whose O
hands O
rested O
the O
appointment O
of O
kitchen O
- O
maids O
as O
well O
as O
cooks O

" O
And O
why O
does O
such O
as O
you O
come O
here O
? O
" O
resumed O
the O
housekeeper O
. O
" O
Because O
the O
squire O
ordered O
t'other O
man O
to O
bring O
me O

answered O
Michael S-PERSON
. O
shape O
, O
both O
mind O

body O

may O
take O
my O
word O
for O
that O

all O
of O

she O
added O
, O
looking O
round O
her O

" O

you O
will O
do O
well O

teach O
it O

" O
" O
I'll O
be O
burnt O
if O
I O
don't O
think O
it O
very O
likely O
that O
it O
was O

father O

him O
here O

no O

Mr. O

chuckling O
. O
" O

Jennings S-PERSON

" O
returned O
Mrs. O
Thompson S-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
frown O
. O
" O
God O
in O
heaven O

— O
Not O

what O
it O
does O
look O
strange O

there's O
no O
denying O
that O

" O
" O
Do O
you O
know O
any O
thing O
about O
your O
father O

said O
Mr. O
Simkins S-PERSON
in O
a O
magisterial O
tone O
. O
" O
Father's O
in O
heaven O

" O
replied O
the O
child O
. O
" O
Mercy O
on O
me O
! O
do O
you O
hear O
him O

Is O
not O
that O
like O
mocking O
the O
Lord's S-PERSON
prayer O

exclaimed O
the O
lady's O
- O
maid O

" O
No O

it O

not O
! O

said O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
while O
a O
flash O
of O
youthful O
indignation O
rushed O
into O
his O
face O
. O
" O
My O
father O
is O
in O
heaven O
along O
with O
God O
. O
" O
" O
I O
dare O
say O
he O
means O
that O
his O
father O
is O
dead O
, O
" O
observed O
the O
butler O
with O
an O
air O
of O
great O
sagacity O

" O
and O
if O
what O
has O
been O
jealoused O
at O
is O
correct O
, O
" O
he O
added O
, O
winking O
his O
eye O
at O
Mr. O
Jennings S-PERSON
, O
" O
it O
is O
very O
natural O
that O
he O
should O
have O
been O
told O
to O
say O
so O
. O
" O
" O
That's O
very O
true O
, O
" O
said O
the O
housekeeper O
, O
" O
and O
it O
may O
be O
, O
certainly O
, O
that O
the O
child O
knows O
nothing O
about O
it O
whatever O
, O
either O
one S-CARDINAL
way O
or O
t'other O
— O
indeed O
I O
think O
it's O
a O
good O
deal O
the O
most O
likely O
that O
he O
does O
not O
| | O
— O
but O
, O
any O
how O
, O
it's O
a O
very O
shocking O
business O
, O
and O
, O
as O
far O
as O
I O
am O
concerned O
, O
I'll O
neither O
make O
nor O
meddle O
in O
the O
matter O
. O
— O
Of O
course O
, O
the O
men-servants O
may O
do O
just O
as O
they O
like O
about O
taking O
notice O
of O
him O
— O
for O
here O
he O
is O
, O
and O
here O
he O
will O
bide O
, O
I O
dare O
say O

but O
I O
recommend O
the O
maids O
to O
follow O
my O
example O
, O
and O
not O
to O
injure O
their O
characters O
, O
nor O
to O
corrupt O
their O
morals O
by O
having O
any O
thing O
to O
do O
with O
the O
offspring O
of O
— O
It O
is O
more O
decent O
not O
to O
finish O
what O
I O
was O
going O
to O
say O
for O
your O
goods O
, O
young O
women O
, O
— O
and O
lucky O
it O
is O
that O
there O
is O
no O
need O
. O
You O
must O
all O
understand O
me O
without O
it O

" O
Mrs. O
Thompson S-PERSON
then O
rose O
from O
her O
chair O
, O
and O
turning O
her O
eyes O
, O
and O
indeed O
her O
head O
, O
aside O
, O
to O
prevent O
herself O
from O
again O
seeing O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
she O
walked O
with O
a O
degree O
of O
stateliness O
and O
majesty O
that O
few O
housekeepers O
ever O
attained O
, O
through O
the O
kitchen O
, O
along O
the O
passage O
, O
across O
the O
servants' O
hall O
, O
into O
the O
sacred O
shelter O
of O
her O
own O
parlour O
, O
where O
she O
gave O
way O
to O
emotions O
which O
rendered O
a O
glass O
of O
prime O
London B-GPE
Madeira E-GPE
absolutely O
necessary O
. O
Meanwhile O
Michael S-PERSON
remained O
in O
no O
very O
happy O
condition O
in O
the O
kitchen O
. O
He O
was O
very O
tired O
, O
very O
sleepy O
, O
very O
thirsty O
, O
very O
much O
longing O
to O
see O
his O
mother O
and O
brother O
, O
and O
very O
greatly O
puzzled O
as O
to O
himself O
. O
But O
though O
accounted O
to O
be O
a O
brave O
little O
fellow O
for O
his O
age O
, O
he O
could O
not O
muster O
courage O
enough O
to O
ask O
any O
question O
of O
those O
around O
him O

if O
he O
had O
, O
it O
would O
have O
been O
of O
no O
avail O

for O
the O
very O
moment O
Mrs. O
Thompson S-PERSON
was O
out O
of O
sight O
, O
so O
many O
of O
the O
servants O
began O
talking O
together O
, O
that O
no O
sounds O
his O
voice O
could O
produce O
would O
have O
been O
heard O
. O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
subject O
, O
and O
filled O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
chorus O
. O
Then O
followed O
some O
facetious O
observations O
from O
Mr. O
Jennings S-PERSON
concerning O
Mrs. O
Thompson S-PERSON
, O
and O
a O
few O
of O
her O
peculiarities O

and O
it O
was O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
the O
giggling O
which O
these O
occasioned O
, O
that O
the O
kitchen O
- O
maid O
ventured O
to O
say O
— O
" O
Well O
, O
now O
, O
you O
are O
all O
so O
keen O
, O
and O
so O
clever O
about O
her O
, O
that O
I O
wonder O
it O
don't O
come O
into O
your O
heads O
to O
find O
out O
that O
she O
spoke O
just O
like O
an O
old O
fool O
and O
no O
better O
, O
when O
she O
invented O
all O
that O
rigmarole O
about O
the O
boy O
. O
Master O
might O
be O
just O
the O
devil O

says O
he O
is O

and O
ten S-CARDINAL
times O
worser O
too O
, O
for O
any O
thing O
I O
know O
about O
him O

the O
worser O
he O
is O
, O
the O
father O
I'd O
be O
, O
if O
I O
was O
such O
a O
mighty O
good O
gentlewoman O
as O
she O
thinks O
herself O
, O
from O
giving O
such O
a O
bad O
father O
out O
of O
my O
own O
invention O
to O
any O
body O

whether O
they O
comed O
out O
of O
the O
factory O

not O

" O
I O
do O
think O
Molly's S-PERSON
right O

one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
housemaids O

— O

old O
frump O

our O
having O
any O
familiarity O

this O
dirty O
little O
boy O

it O
certainly O
does O
appear O
plain O
enough O

have O
punished O
his O
ingratitude O
, O
by O
requesting O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
to O
turn O
him O
out O
of O
doors O
again O

and O
, O
moreover O
, O
have O
for O
ever O
abandoned O
the O
generous O
idea O
of O
surrounding O
his O
young O
head O
, O
as O
she O
poetically O
expressed O
it O
, O
with O
a O
halo O
of O
immortality O
, O
by O
means O
of O
getting O
Mr. O
Osmund B-PERSON
Norval E-PERSON
to O
relate O
his O
adventure O
in O
verse O
. O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
went O
to O
his O
bed O
also O
, O
hardly O
better O
pleased O
with O
what O
had O
occurred O
than O
little O
Michael S-PERSON
. O
But O
there O
was O
this O
difference O
between O
them O
: O
little O
Michael S-PERSON
said O
his O
prayers O
, O
which O
the O
great O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
did O
not O
| | O
but O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
spent O
his O
last O
waking O
moment O
in O
cursing O
, O
with O
great O
fervour O
of O
spirit O
, O
the O
folly O
of O
the O
hideous O
old O
maid O
, O
who O
had O
entailed O
such O
a O
detestable O
burden O
upon O
him O
— O
the O
result O
of O
which O
, O
as O
a O
peace O
- O
offering O
to O
the O
whole O
body O
of O
operatives O
, O
was O
at O
any O
rate O
but O
problematical O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
when O
he O
awoke O
the O
next O
morning O
with O
his O
head O
quite O
cool O
, O
he O
felt O
disposed O
to O
think O
more O
of O
the O
hint O
given O
him O
by O
his O
friend O
and O
favourite O
Dr. O
Crockley S-PERSON
, O
and O
less O
of O
the O
inconvenience O
of O
having O
a B-MONEY
few I-MONEY
pounds E-MONEY
to O
pay O
out O
of O
hundreds B-CARDINAL
of I-CARDINAL
thousands E-CARDINAL
for O
a O
job O
, O
which O
, O
if O
well O
managed O
, O
might O
help O
, O
perhaps O
, O
to O
avert O
a O
monstrous O
deal O
of O
mischief O
. O
With O
these O
rational O
thoughts O
working O
strongly O
in O
his O
ever-active O
brain O
, O
he O
rang O
his O
bell O
, O
and O
ordered O
that O
Joseph B-PERSON
Parsons E-PERSON
, O
his O
principal O
overlooker O
, O
should O
be O
sent O
for O
instantly O

shown O
into O
his O
study O
. O
A B-TIME
short I-TIME

brought O
the O

in O
the O
snug O

the O
first S-ORDINAL

" O
Good O
morning O
, O
Parsons S-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
. O
The O
overlooker O
bowed O
his O
head O
respectfully O
. O
" O
Have O
you O

inquired O
Sir O

" O
As O
much O

the O

how O

that O

down O

sit O
down O

let O
us O
hear O
all O
about O
it O

" O
I O
was O
a O

if O
you O

me O

rejoined O
the O
overlooker O

" O
for O
to O
say O
truth O
, O
my O
mind O
misgives O
me O
, O
that O
there's O
mischief O
brewing O

" O
" O
I O
have O
heard O
as O
much O

" O
said O
the O
master O

" O
but O
it O
can O
hardly O

gone O
very O
far O

such O

sharp O

you O

" O
That's O
true O

sir O

" O
said O
the O
man O
, O
with O
a O
grim O
smile O
, O
in O
acknowledgment O
of O
the O
compliment O

" O
and O
I've O
not O
been O
idle O

I O
promise O
you O

all O
I O
know O

that O
the O

taken O
dudgeon O
about O

that O
died O
the B-DATE
week I-DATE

just O
after O
leaving O

Parsons S-PERSON

to O
have O
a O
girl O
go O
on O
working O

and O
not O
know O
whether O
she O
was O
dying O

" O
" O
And O
how O
is O
one O
to O
know O

sir O

I'll O
defy O
any O
man O

find O
out O

tricks O

what O

real O
faintings O

" O
" O
You O
won't O
tell O

Parsons S-PERSON

that O
if O
you O
set O
your O
wits O

" O
" O
That's O
not O
the O
question O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
asking O
your O
pardon O

There's O
no O
great O
difficulty O
in O
finding O
out O
whether O
they O
are O
in O
a O
real O
faint O

only O
making O
the O
most O

little O
sickish O
from O
standing O

and O
want O
of O
air O

That's O
not O
the O
difficulty O

The O
thing O
is O
to O
know O
, O
when O
they O
really O
take O
to O
the O
downright O
faintings O

live O
through O
it O

" O
" O
And O
where O
is O
the O
great O
difficulty O
of O
that O
? O
You O
know O
Dr. O
Crockley S-PERSON
would O
come O
at O
a O
moment's O
warning O
at O
any O
time O

feel O
their O
pulses O

" O
" O
And O
he O
does O
do O
it O
, O
sir O

But O
, O
in O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
place O
, O
I O
doubt O
if O
any O
man O
can O
justly O
tell O
whether O
girls O
are O
likely O
to O
go O
on O
fainting O
, O
and O
up O
again O
, O
as O
lots O
and O
lots O
of O
'em O
do O
for O
years S-DATE
, O
or O
drop O
down O
and O
die O
, O
as O
Nancy B-PERSON
Stephens E-PERSON
did O
. O
That's O
one S-CARDINAL
thing O
| | O
and O
another O
is O
, O
that O
Dr. O
Crockley S-PERSON
is O
so O
fond O
of O
a O
joke O
, O
that O
' O
tis O
rarely O
one O
knows O
when O
he O
speaks O
earnest O
, O
and O
when O
he O
does O
not O
. O
He O
did O
see O
Nancy B-PERSON
Stephens E-PERSON
, O
about B-DATE
a I-DATE
month I-DATE
ago E-DATE
, O
and O
all O
he O
said O

, O
' O

look O
a O
little O
pale O
in O
the O

sure O

a O
dance O
would O
cure O
her O

I O
have O
no O
doubt O

' O
A O
dance O

I O
, O

please O
to O
tell O
me O

says O
I O
, O
how O
the O
work O
is O
to O
get O
on O

if O
the O
factory O
boys O

girls O
sets O
off O
dancing O

" O
" O
' O
Maybe O
you O

got O
a O
fiddle O

suit O
you O

them O

And O
with O
that O
, O
if O
you'll O
believe O
me O
, O
sir O

he O
set O
off O
capering O

making O
antics O

just O
as O
if O
there O
had O
been O
somebody O
behind O
a O
- O
strapping O
him O
. O
To O
be O
sure O
, O
it O
was O
fit O
to O
make O
one O
die O
of O
laughing O
to O
see O
him O

but O
that's O
not O
the O
way O

know O

to O
do O
one O
any O
good O
as O
to O
finding O
out O
the O
real O
condition O
of O
the O
people O

" O
Sir O
Mathew S-PERSON
could O
not O
resist O
a O
hearty O
laugh O
at O
this O
characteristic O
trait O
of O
his O
friend O
, O
but O
he O
concluded O
by O
acknowledging O
that O
Parsons S-PERSON
was O
quite O
right O
in O
saying O
that O
this O
way O
of O
doing O
business O
was O
more O
agreeable O
than O
useful O

" O
However O
, O
Parsons S-PERSON
, O
" O
he O
continued O

" O
we O
must O
not O

up O

the O
rousing O
up O

attention O
again O

the O
danger O

see O
what O

done O
about O

" O
I O
knows O
him O
well O
enough O

Sir O

he's O

he O
comed O
to O
the O

just O
about O
five S-CARDINAL

" O
" O
And O
what O
sort O
of O
a O
boy O
is O
he O
, O
Parsons S-PERSON
? O
" O
" O
Nothing O
very O
particular O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
unless O
it O
is O
because O
of O
the O
unaccountable O
fuss O
he O
makes O
about O
his O
elder O
brother O
, O
who O
is O
but O
a O
poor O
rickety O
, O
shriveldy O
sort O
of O
a O
child O
. O
For O
some O
reason O
or O
other O
, O
his O
bones O
never O
seemed O
to O
come O
rightly O
straight O
, O
and O
this O
Mike S-PERSON
makes O
as O
great O
a O
fuss O
about O
him O
, O
as O
if O
he O
was O
his O
grandmother O
. O
" O
" O
Are O
the O
parents O
living O
? O
" O
inquired O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
. O
" O
The O
mother O
is O
. O
She O
is O
a O
bedridden O
woman O
, O
and O
ought O
to O
be O
in O
the O
workhouse O
| | O
but O
she's O
upish O
, O
and O
can't O
abide O
it O
, O
and O
so O
she O
lies O
abed O
, O
doing O
plain O
work O
and O
that O
, O
and O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
boys' O
wages O
maintains O
'em O
. O
But O
I O
did O
hear O
t'other O
day O
, O
she O
had O
given O
in O
, O
and O
was O
a O
begging O
to O
go O
into O
the O
house O
, O
and O
take O
the O
eldest O
boy O
with O
her O
. O
These O
creturs O
never O
know O
what O
they O
would O
be O
at O
. O
I O
suspect O
, O
howsomever O
, O
that O
she O
has O
got O
hold O
of O
a O
notion O
, O
that O
because O
he's O
so O
cripply O
, O
he O
beant O
to O
work O
no O
more O
| | O
but O
I O
shall O
take O
care O
to O
see O
Butchel S-PERSON
, O
the O
parish O
- O
overseer O
, O
about O
it O
. O
It O
is O
altogether O
a O
trick O
that O
, O
what O
won't O
answer O
— O
his O
fingers O
is O
just O
as O
able O
to O
handle O
the O
reels O
, O
and O
piece O
the O
threads O
as O
ever O
they O
was O

and O
in O
course O
, O
a O
little O
dwarf O
like O
him O
, O
with O
his O
legs O
like O
crooked O
drumsticks O
, O
can't O
look O
for O
any O
but O
the O
youngest O
wages O

so O
after O
all O
, O
he's O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
them O
as O
answers O
best O
. O
" O
" O
No O
! O
Parsons S-PERSON
, O
no O
! O
ejaculated O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
with O
sudden O
energy O
. O
That O
woman O
must O
not O
go O
into O
the O
workhouse O
. O
The O
whole O
thing O
shall O
be O
got O
up O
, O
I O
tell O
you O
, O
in O
the O
best O
possible O
style O
. O
What O
d'ye O
say O
now O
to O
getting O
the O
woman O
arrested O
for O
debt O
? O
— O
or O
having O
all O
her O
things O
sold O
? O
— O
and O
we O
just O
stepping O
in O
at O
the O
very O
nick O
of O
time O
, O
to O
save O
her O
from O
destruction O
! O
" O
There O
was O
something O
so O
truly O
comic O
in O
the O
expression O
of O
the O
knight's O
countenance O
, O
as O
he O
said O
this O
, O
that O
even O
the O
saturnine O
Mr. O
Parsons S-PERSON
could O
not O
help O
laughing O
. O
" O
If O
the O
born O
devils O
don't O
sing O
your O
praises O
through O
the O
country O

sir O

" O
said O
he O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
had O
recovered O
his O
gravity O
, O
" O
why O
we O
must O
find O
some O
other O
way O

go O
to O
work O

" O
" O
Now O
then O
be O
off O
, O
Parsons S-PERSON
, O
and O
contrive O
some O
clever O
scheme O
or O
other O
to O
throw O
the O
unhappy O
family O
into O
a O
quandary O
. O
" O
" O
I O
understand O
, O
sir O
, O
" O
said O
Parsons S-PERSON
, O
nodding O
his O
head O
, O
and O
so O
parted O
the O
master O

He O
lost O

a O
short O
interview O
with O
one S-CARDINAL

the O
parish O

who O
was O
his O

then O
made O
his O
way O
to O
Hoxley B-FAC

with O
the O
intention O

as O

The O

It O

narrow O

Exactly O

excess O
by O
the O

drawn O
together O

the O

There O

that O
spoke O
fully O

cash O
in O
the O
unthrifty O
tribe O

throughout O

The O
very O
vilest O

hanging O

replied O
Mr. O
Parsons S-PERSON

adding O
, O
with O
a O
finger O
pointed O
at O
the O
squalling O
child O
, O
who O
still O
continued O
under O
the O
cleansing O
process O
above O
described O
, O
" O
And O
isn't O
it O
a O
comfort O
now O

rid O

" O
The O
woman O
ceased O
to O
shake O
her O
little O
boy O
, O
and O
looking O
for O
a O
moment O
at O
the O
clear O
blue O
eyes O
that O
, O
notwithstanding O
her O
rough O
discipline O
, O
were O
very O
lovingly O
turned O
up O
to O
her O
face O
— O
something O
like O
a O
shudder O
passed O
over O
her O
. O
" O
Get O
along O
in O
with O
you O
, O
Bill S-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
as O
if O
afraid O
that O
the O
blighting O
glance O
of O
the O
superintendent O
should O
rest O
upon O
him O

and O
then O
added O
, O
" O
as O
long O

it O

find O
the O
widow O

" O
" O
Yes O

please O
your O
honour O

you'll O
be O
sure O

a O
cripple O

can't O
stir O

" O
" O
She's S-PERSON

up O
her O
mind O

go O
into O

demanded O
the O
manager O
. O
" O
Have O
she O
indeed O
, O
poor O
thing O
? O
" O
responded O
the O
woman O
, O
in O
an O
accent O
of O
compassion O
. O
man O
in O
the O
whole O
world O
, O
has O
taken O
a O
fancy O
to O
her O
boy O
, O
and O
he'll O
be O
a O
father O
to O
him O
, O
I'll S-PERSON
be O
bound O
to O
say O
he O
will O

and O
that's O
why O
I O
think O
he'd O
like O
me O
to O
give O
her O
a O
call O
, O
just O
to O
tell O
her O
not O
to O
fret O
herself O
about O
the O
workhouse O
. O
If O
she O
don't O
like O
going O
there O
, O
she O
needn't O
, O
I O
dare O
say O
, O
with O
such O
a O
good O
friend O
as O
she's O
got O
. O
" O
The O
woman O
stared O
at O
him O
with O
an O
air O
of O
such O
genuine O
astonishment O
, O
that O
the O
superintendent O
felt O
disconcerted O
, O
and O
turning O
abruptly O
away O
, O
continued O
his O
progress O
down O
the O
lane O
. O
By O
the O
time O
he O
had O
reached O
No. O
12 S-CARDINAL
, O
however O
, O
he O
had O
begun O
to O
doubt O
whether O
his O
sudden O
appearance O
at O
the O
bedside O
of O
the O
widow O
Armstrong S-PERSON
might O
not O
produce O
an O
effect O
unfavourable O
to O
the O
object O
he O
had O
in O
view O
. O
" O
As O
sure O
as O
steam's O
steam O
, O
" O
thought O
he O
, O
" O
she'll O
be O
more O
inclined O
to O
fancy O
that O
I O
am O
come O
scolding O
about O
the O

something O

than O
to O
take O
her O
part O

do O
her O
pleasure O

so O
I'll O
just O
say O
a O
civil O
word O
to O
the O
Sykeses S-PERSON

and O
then O
stroll O
away O
on O
, O
till O
such O
time O

the O

been O
after O
her O

engage O

to O
him O

if O
I O
turn O
in O

there O

if O
to O
see O
what O
was O
going O

it O
would O
certainly O
be O
more O
natural O

" O
Mr. O

the O

Again O
Napoleon S-PERSON

favour O

over O

poverty O

clean O

cap O
was O
clean O
, O

bedclothes O

clean O

the O
pale O
hands O

so O
very O
white O

that O

Mr. O

ventured O
to O
speak O
any O
opinion O
concerning O

would O
certainly O
have O
given O
utterance O
to O
a O
strong O
expression O
of O
indignation O
, O
at O
the O
abominable O
air O
of O
delicacy O
which O
her O
appearance O
displayed O
. O
She O
looked O
as O
if O
she O
were O
struggling O
with O
some O
painful O
feeling O
, O

did O
not O
weep O
, O
though O
her O
boy O
did O
, O
heartily O
. O
For O
a O
little O
while O
she O
suffered O
his O
tears O
to O
flow O
without O
interruption O
or O
reproof O
, O

she O
kissed O
him O
once O

twice O

thrice O

" O
There O

Michael S-PERSON

all O

him O

indeed O

sir O

I O
don't O

the O
day O
he O
was O
born O

God O
bless O
him O

I O
have O
had O
little O
besides O
love O

give O
him O

indeed O
, O

I O
think O
the O
child O

" O
Michael S-PERSON
slily O
stole O
his O
little O
hand O
sideways O
under O
the O
bedclothes O
, O
where O
it O
was O
soon O
clasped O
in O
that O
of O
his O
mother O
, O
but O
his O
eyes O
were O
again O
firmly O
rivetted O
upon O
the O
ground O
. O
" O
Ay O
, O
ay O
, O
that's O
all O
very O
well O

it O

nothing O

any O
way O
with O
his O
duty O

obligations O
to O
Sir O

What O
I O
want O
to O
know O
is O
, O
whether O
he O
is O
ready O
and O
willing O
to O
do O
that O
which O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
will O
require O
of O
him O

that's O
the O
main O
question O

see O

Mrs. O
Armstrong S-PERSON

" O
" O
And O
what O
will O
that O
be O

said O
the O
widow O
, O
while O
Michael's S-PERSON
eyes O
were O
again O
raised O
for O
a O
moment O
to O
the O
face O
of O
his O
taskmaster O

The O
poor O
woman O
smiled O

little O
Michael S-PERSON
shook O
his O
head O

superintendent O
appeared O
to O

no O

again O
striking O
his O
cane O
magisterially O
upon O
the O

added O
, O
" O

him O

up O

MICHAEL S-PERSON
WITH O
HIS O
OWN O
HANDS O

and O
Teddy S-PERSON
would O
take O
care O
one O

have O
him O
back O
again O
, O

of O
every O
thing O

they O
found O
that O
they O
could O
not O
do O
so O
well O
without O
him O
. O
But O
even O
while O
this O
went O
on O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
was O
improving O
his O
toilet O
by O
putting O
on O
the O
more O
carefully O
patched O
garments O
, O
which O
had O
hitherto O
been O
kept O
sacred O
for O
Sundays S-DATE

When O
this O
operation O
was O
completed O
, O
and O
his O
hair O
, O
face O
, O
and O
hands O
made O
as O
clean O
as O
the O
joint O
efforts O
of O
himself O

his O
mother O
could O
contrive O
to O
make O
them O
, O
the O
little O
boy O
turned O
to O
leave O
the O
miserable O
shed O
that O
had O
been O
his O
home O
, O
with O
a O
reluctant O
step O
and O
heavy O
heart O
, O
retracing O
the O
short O
distance O
between O
his O
mother's O
bed O
and O
the O
door O
, O
once O
and O
again O
to O
take O
another O
kiss O
, O
and O
to O
repeat O
, O
with O
increased O
earnestness O
, O
the O
questions O
, O
" O
Isn't O

nothing O

morning O

" O
But O
at O
length O
the O
lingering O
separation O
was O
completed O
, O
and O
Michael S-PERSON
set O
off O
upon O
his O
return O
to O
Dowling B-FAC

. O
In O
the O
mean O
time O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
himself O
had O
not O
been O
idle O
| | O
but O
, O
retiring O
to O
his O
study O
, O
he O
composed O
a O
paragraph O
for O
the O
county O
newspaper O
, O
which O
, O
after O
considerable O
study O
and O
repeated O
corrections O
, O
was O
at O
length O
completed O
, O
and O
despatched O
by O
the O
post O
, O
in O
a O
feigned O

answered O

as O

, O
by O

" O
Where O
is O
the O
little O
boy O

my O
dear O

that O
I O
sent O
into O
the O
servants' O
hall O
last B-TIME

" O
inquired O
Sir O

" O
Upon O
my O
word O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
I O
can't O
tell O

" O
she O
replied O

adding O
, O
in O
that O
tone O
of O
familiar O
confidence O
which O
her O
master's O
condescension O
encouraged O
, O
" O

if O
you O
sent O
him O
into O

hall O

he O
never O

there O

" O

not O
a O
beauty O

none O
such O
, O
as O
was O
before O
stated O

ever O
made O
part O
of O
Lady B-PERSON
Dowling's E-PERSON
household O

but O
she O
was O
a O
wit O
, O
and O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
was O
to O
clever O
himself O
not O
to O
feel O
the O
value O
of O
cleverness O
in O
others O

he O
, O
therefore O
, O
raised O
his O
eyebrows O
in O
a O
comic O
grimace O
, O
very O
good O
- O
humouredly O
chucked O
the O
maid O
under O
her O
ugly O
chin O

instead O

putting O
himself O
in O
a O
rage O
, O
as O
might O
have O
happened O
under O
other O
circumstances O

my O
dear O

he O
funny O

Sir O

told O
of O
the O
airs O

replied O
the O
jively O
damsel O

" O
she's O
for O
all O
the O

like O
an O
old O
owl O

sits O
winking O
his O

she's O
a O
prime O
favourite O
with O
my O
lady O

into O
the O

knows O
a O
thing O

two S-CARDINAL
about O
soups O

we O
must O
be O
very O
respectful O

my O
dear O

in O
talking O
of O
her O
— O

as O
to O
her O
daring O
to O
say O
, O
that O
the O
boy O
I O
ordered O
into O
the O
hall O
was O
to O
be O
turned O
out O

it O

rather O
more O
than O
possible O

I O
think O

because O
you O
don't O

the O
saucy O

with O

somewhat O
ironical O

Lord O
Crampton's O

might O
have O
their O

impudent O
enough O

became O
rather O
white O
about O

red O
about O

not O

nothing O

about O
you O
, O
sir O
: O
and O
if O
I O
had O
been O
placed O
in O
power O
, O
instead O
of O
having O
none O
, O
your O
will O
would O
have O
been O
obeyed O
, O
if O
every O
servant O
in O
the O
house O
had O
flowed O
at O
me O
for O
it O
. O
" O
" O
You're O
an O
excellent O
girl O
, O
Peggy S-PERSON
, O
" O
replied O
the O
knight O
, O
approaching O
her O
very O
condescendingly O
. O
" O
You O
know O
well O
enough O
that O
you O
are O
a O
favourite O
, O
and O
I O
know O
well O
enough O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
that O
you O
deserve O
to O
be O
so O

and O
I O
tell O
you O
what O
, O
Peggy S-PERSON
, O
I'll O
take O
care O
to O
let O
those O
animals O
, O
my O
servants O
, O
know O
that O
I O
am O
master O
here O
, O
as O
well O
as O
in O
the O
factory O
— O
and O
that O
my O
word's O
law O
! O
" O
" O
And O
so O
it O
ought O
to O
be O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
" O
replied O
the O
obedient O
domestic O
. O
" O
I O
hope O
I O
know O
my O
duty O
too O
well O
to O
dispute O
my O
master's O
will O
in O
any O
thing O

" O
and O
as O
she O
spoke O
she O
very O
meekly O
yielded O
herself O
to O
receive O
the O
condescending O
salute O
, O
with O
which O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
was O
pleased O
to O
reward O
her O
excellent O
sentiments O
. O
" O
You O
are O
an O
excellent O
good O
girl O
, O
Peggy S-PERSON
! O
" O
he O
resumed O
after O
this O
little O
interruption O

" O
and O
don't O
fear O
but O
I O
shall O
find O
means O
to O
reward O
you O
. O
But O
you O
must O
give O
me O
your O
help O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
to O
confound O
the O
impertinence O
of O
these O
fellow O

servants O

yours O

if O
I O
don't O
make O

wait O
upon O
that O
beggar's O
brat O
as O
if O
he O
was O
their O
lord O
and O
master O

never O
trust O
me O
with O
a O
kiss O
more O

Where O
is O
the O
little O
factory O
vermin O
, O
Peggy S-PERSON
? O
" O
" O
I O
ain't O
able O
to O
answer O
you O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
| | O
all O
I O
know O
is O
, O
that O
Mrs. O
Thompson S-PERSON
marched O
us O
all O
out O
of O
the O
kitchen O
where O
she O
sat O
in O
judgment O
on O
him O
, O
last O
night O
, O
and O
there O
he O
was O
left O
with O
the O
kitchen O
- O
maid O
and O
the O
fat O
cook O

but O
what's O
come O
of O
him O
since O
, O
I O
am O
no O
ways O
able O
to O
say O
. O
" O
On O
hearing O
this O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
raised O
his O
hand O
towards O
the O
bell O
, O
but O
suddenly O
recollecting O
himself O
, O
he O
smiled O
and O
said O
, O
" O
No O
, O
no O
, O
that O
won't O
do O
, O
Peggy S-PERSON
, O
will O
it O
? O
Go O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
and O
ask O
where O
the O
boy O
is O
, O
and O
then O
come O
back O
and O
tell O
me O

" O
approval O
of O
his O
discretion O

and O
upon O
leaving O
his O
study O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
prosecuting O
her O
inquiries O
among O
the O
servants O
, O
she O
encountered O
the O
object O
of O
them O
, O
as O
he O
entered O
the O
back O
- O
door O
, O
on O
his O
return O
from O
visiting O
his O
mother's O
cottage O
. O
" O
Soh S-PERSON
! O
here O
you O
are O
then O
? O
Well O
, O
you O
must O
come O
along O
this B-TIME
minute E-TIME
to O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
addressing O
him O
somewhat O
gruffly O
, O
and O
not O
too O
well O
pleased O
, O
perhaps O
, O
at O
this O
interruption O
to O
the O
confidential O
conversation O
with O
her O
master O
, O
which O
it O
had O
been O
her O
purpose O
to O
renew O
. O
But O
to O
the O
ears O
of O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
the O
name O
of O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
was O
sufficient O
to O
render O
all O
other O
words O
indifferent O
| | O
and O
conscious O
only O
, O
that O
into O
his O
dreaded O
presence O
he O
must O
go O
if O
commanded O
to O
do O
so O
, O
he O
followed O
the O
girl O
with O
a O
beating O
heart O
, O
and O
in O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes E-TIME
stood O
pale O
, O
and O
almost O
breathless O
, O
before O
the O
awful O
countenance O
of O
the O
great O
man O
. O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
gazed O
at O
him O
for O
a O
moment O
with O
a O
sort O
of O
sneer O
, O
which O
, O
if O
interpreted O
skilfully O
, O
would O
have O
been O
found O
to O
address O
itself O
inwardly O
. O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
could O
not O
choose O
but O
sneer O
at O
the O
whimsical O
arrangements O
of O
accidents O
, O
which O
had O
converted O
him O
into O
a O
Mr. O
Allworthy S-PERSON
. O
The O
sneer O
, O
however O
, O
as O
far O
as O
it O
concerned O
himself O
, O
had O
no O
mixture O
of O
contempt O
in O
it O
. O
" O
Had O
another O
done O
this O
thing O
, O
" O
thought O
he O
, O
" O
should O
I O
not O
have O
called O
him O
fool O

is O
it O
not O
ninety B-DATE

to O
a O
hundred S-CARDINAL

thereby O
I O

him O
truly O

the O

be O
said O
of O
me O

No O

How O
now O

made O
yourself O

Fine O

isn't O
he O
, O
Peggy S-PERSON
? O
" O
As O
he O
thus O
jeered O
the O
little O
fellow O
, O
his O
eye O
wandered O
with O
malignant O
jocularity O
over O
his O
person O
, O
which O
was O
, O
in O
truth O
, O
the O
very O
model O
of O
make O
- O
shift O
poverty O

while O
the O
child O
, O
as O
if O
he O
felt O
his O
eye O
palpably O
crawl O
like O
a O
reptile O
over O
him O
, O
shuddered O
he O
knew O
not O
why O

Then O
, O
changing O
his O
tone O
so O
suddenly O
, O
as O
to O
make O
even O
the O
confiding O
Peggy S-PERSON
start O
, O
he O
continued O
, O
" O
You O
horrid O
lump O
of O
rags O
stand O
back O

stand O
back O

be O
sure O

the O
girl O

" O

the O
son O

up O

" O
This O
was O
said O
in O
a O
manner O
to O
remove O
all O
doubts O
as O
to O
the O
munificent O
knight's O
being O
in O
earnest O

and O
the O
active O
Peggy S-PERSON
went O
and O
returned O
with O
as O
little O
delay O
as O
was O
consistent O
with O
the O
necessity O
she O
felt O
herself O
under O
, O
of O
entering O
into O
some O
short O
explanation O
with O
the O
nursery O
ladies O

much O
inclined O

the O
first S-ORDINAL
opening O
of O
her O
mission O

to O
treat O
the O
whole O
business O

a O
hoax O

When O
at O
length O
, O
however O
, O
she O
had O
succeeded O
in O
making O
it O
apparent O
that O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
was O
waiting O
for O
the O
suit O
of O
clothes O
in O
a O
most O
monstrous O
outrageous O
passion O
of O
a O
hurry O
, O
the O
messenger's O
arms O
were O
speedily O
loaded O
in O
exact O
conformity O
to O
the O
orders O
she O
had O
brought O
, O
and O
she O
returned O
to O
the O
knight's O
study O
with O
all O
that O
was O
needful O
to O
convert O
the O
rude O
exterior O
of O
little O
Michael S-PERSON
into O
the O
nearest O
resemblance O
that O
nature O
would O
permit O
, O
to O
the O
elegant O
and O
accomplished O
Master O
Duodecimus O
. O
Considering O
the O
loathing O
and O
disgust O
manifested O
by O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
towards O
the O
person O
and O
the O
poverty O
of O
his O
protegé O
, O
it O
was O
extraordinary O
to O
see O
the O
amusement O
he O
seemed O
to O
derive O
from O
dressing O
him O
up O
. O
Though O
the O
alert O
and O
obedient O
Peggy S-PERSON
stood O
close O
by O
to O
do O
his O
pleasure O
, O
it O
was O
his O
own O
large O
hands O
that O
thrust O
the O
little O
limbs O
of O
Michael S-PERSON
into O
the O
clothing O
he O
chose O
they O
should O
wear O
, O
and O
it O
was O
amidst O
shouts O
of O
laughter O
from O
both O
, O
that O
the O
ludicrous O
metamorphosis O
was O
completed O
. O
But O
somehow O
or O
other O
when O
they O
had O
finished O
their O
masquerading O
work O
, O
the O
result O
was O
not O
altogether O
what O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
anticipated O
. O
The O
clothes O
were O
very O
handsome O
, O
well O
- O
made O
clothes O
, O
and O
as O
poor O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
notwithstanding O
his O
leanness O
, O
was O
a O
very O
handsome O
, O
wellmade O
boy O
, O
the O
incongruity O
between O
them O
seemed O
to O
vanish O
in O
the O
most O
unaccountable O
manner O
, O
as O
the O
operation O
drew O
towards O
a O
conclusion O
. O
Peggy S-PERSON
, O
however O
, O
was O
not O
such O
a O
fool O
as O
not O
to O
understand O
what O
was O
expected O
of O
her O
| | O
so O
when O
the O
knight O
, O
catching O
up O
his O
son's O
tasselled O
cap O
, O
pressed O
it O
down O
upon O
the O
little O
curly O
head O
as O
a O
lusty O
packer O
of O
worthless O
goods O
thrusts O
down O
the O
cover O
that O
is O
to O
enclose O
them O
, O
and O
then O
pushed O
the O
child O
towards O
her O
with O
an O
impulse O
that O
nearly O
brought O
him O
upon O
his O
nose O
, O
she O
very O
judiciously O
renewed O
her O
noisy O
laughter O
, O
exclaiming O
, O
" O
Did O
any O
one O
ever O
see O
such O
a O
little O
quiz O

Sir O

eyeing O
him O
with O

would O
be O
well O

the O
scamp O

that O

bet O

" O
During O
the O
whole O
of O
the O
undressing O
and O
redressing O
operations O
, O
the O
boy's O
cheeks O
had O
been O
dyed O
with O
blushes O
, O
and O
his O
eyes O
so O
fixedly O
nailed O
to O
the O
floor O
, O
that O
neither O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON

his O
maid O
had O
been O
able O
to O
enjoy O
their O
embarrassed O
expression O

as O
this O
dark O
prophecy O
fell O
on O
him O

he O
looked O
up O

it O
was O
well O
for O
him O

his O
munificent O
patron O
at O
the O

instant O
turned O
his O
mocking O
glances O

the O
servant O

had O
he O
met O
that O
speaking O

he O
could O
hardly O
have O
misunderstood O
the O
scorn O
that O
shot O
from O
it O

As O
it O
was O
, O
however O

he O
saw O
nothing O

were O
scattered O
round O

once O
more O
sneering O

were O
enjoying O
some O

Mr. O

no O

cast O
his O
eyes O
on O

little O

arose O

the O
conciliatory O
smiles O

this O
gay O

did O
not O
descend O

enjoyed O

looking O
up O

an O
air O
of O
surprise O

for O
Miss O

queer O

looking O

looking O
as O
she O
was O

Michael S-PERSON
met O
her O
eye O
with O
pleasure O

for O
that O
too O
spoke O
kindly O
, O
though O
it O
was O
neihter O
large O

Martha S-PERSON
Dowling S-PERSON
was O
in O
truth O
, O
about O
as O
ugly O
as O
it O
was O
possible O
for O
a O
girl O
of O
seventeen S-DATE

one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
whole O
set O
( O

that O
poor O
vulgar O
Martha S-PERSON
) O
, O
who O
was O
not O
most O

genteel O

looking O

" O
" O
Genteel O
looking O
" O
she O
certainly O
was O
not O
, O
nor O
graceful O
, O
nor O
beautiful O
in O
any O
way O
: O
and O
the O
consequence O
was O
, O
that O
father O
, O
mother O
, O
brothers O
, O
and O
sisters O
, O
were O
all O
most O
heartily O
ashamed O
of O
her O
. O
This O
was O
a O
misfortune O
, O
and O
she O
felt O
it O
to O
be O
so O
pretty O
sharply O
, O
for O
poor O
vulgar O
Martha S-PERSON
was O
far O
from O
being O
a O
stupid O
girl O
. O
But O
, O
in O
her O
case O
, O
as O
in O
a B-CARDINAL
million E-CARDINAL
of O
others O
, O
it O
might O
be O
seen O
that O
adversity O
, O
though O
" O
Like O
the O
toad O
, O
ugly O
and O
venomous O
, O
Weareth O
a O
precious O
jewel O
in O
its O
head O
. O
" O
for O
of O
all O
her O
race O
she O
was O
the O
only O
one O
whose O
heart O
was O
not O
seared O
and O
hardened O
by O
the O
ceaseless O
operation O
of O
opulent O
self O
- O
indulgence O
. O
She O
felt O
that O
she O
was O
rather O
an O
object O
of O
pity O
than O
of O
admiration O
, O
of O
contempt O
than O
of O
envy O
, O
of O
dislike O
than O
of O
love O
. O
This O
is O
severe O
schooling O
for O
a O
young O
girl's O
heart O
, O
but O
if O
it O
produce O
not O
reckless O
indifference O
, O
or O
callous O
insensibility O
, O
it O
often O
purifies O
, O
softens O
, O
and O
even O
elevates O
the O
character O
. O
Such O
were O
its O
effects O
on O
Martha B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
: O
that O
coarse O
- O
seeming O
exterior O
contained O
the O
only O
spark O
of O
refinement O
of O
which O
the O
Dowling S-PERSON
family O
could O
boast O
. O
Never O
did O
a O
high O
- O
born O
Hidalgo S-PERSON
, O
in O
Spain's S-GPE
proudest O
days O
, O
inculcate O
among O
his O
race O
the O
immeasurable O
importance O
of O
pure O
descent O
, O
with O
more O
ceaseless O
or O
more O
sedulous O
earnestness O
, O
than O
did O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
the O
omnipotence O
of O
wealth O
among O
his O
. O
Every O
child O
was O
taught O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
its O
mind O
became O
capable O
of O
receiving O
the O
important O
truth O
, O
that O
not O
only O
was O
it O
agreeable O
to O
enjoy O
and O
cherish O
all O
the O
good O
things O
which O
wealth O
can O
procure O
, O
but O
that O
it O
was O
their O
bounden O
and O
special O
duty O
to O
make O
it O
visible O
before O
the O
eyes O
of O
all O
men O
that O
they O
could O
, O
and O
that O
they O
did O
, O
have O
more O
money O
spent O
upon O
them O
, O
than O
any O
other O
family O
in O
the O
whole O
country O
| | O
but O
Martha S-PERSON
felt O
that O
all O
this O
could O
not O
apply O
to O
her O
. O
Strange O
to O
say O
, O
the O
only O
tie O
resembling O
affection O
which O
prevented O
the O
total O
isolation O
of O
this O
poor O
girl O
among O
her O
family O
, O
was O
that O
which O
existed O
between O
her O
hard O
- O
natured O
father O
and O
herself O
| | O
but O
it O
was O
a O
sentiment O
not O
easy O
to O
analyze O
. O
In O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
it O
probably O
arose O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
from O
his O
having O
been O
told O
that O
the O
little O
girl O
was O
very O
like O
him O
| | O
and O
, O
on O
hers O
, O
from O
his O
being O
the O
only O
person O
in O
the O
house O
who O
had O
ever O
bestowed O
a O
caress O
upon O
her O
. O
In O
both O
cases O
, O
cause O
and O
effect O
went O
on O
increasing O
. O
Martha's S-PERSON
face O
( O
saving O
its O
expression O
) O
, O
was O
incontrovertibly O
like O
her O
father's O
| | O
and O
, O
for O
that O
reason O
, O
or O
from O
the O
habit O
it O
had O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
created O
, O
her O
father O
, O
though O
rather O
ashamed O
to O
confess O
it O
, O
was O
certainly O
very O
fond O
of O
her O
. O
better O
, O
or O
, O
at O
any O
rate O
, O
more O
strongly O
still O
| | O
for O
it O
was O
rather O
with O
fanaticism O
than O
devotion O
, O
or O
like O
the O
pitying O
fondness O
with O
which O
a O
mother O
dotes O
on O
a O
deformed O
child O
, O
who O
sees O
only O
that O
because O
it O
is O
less O
loveable O
it O
has O
more O
need O
of O
love O
than O
the O
rest O
. O
It O
was O
not O
, O
however O
, O
on O
the O
same O
principle O
, O
that O
Sir O
Matthew's S-PERSON
affection O
for O
his O
ugly O
daughter O
increased O
as O
years O
rolled O
on O
| | O
for O
he O
saw O
, O
that O
though O
as O
a O
child O
she O
had O
been O
like O
him O
, O
she O
was O
now O
grown O
very O
plain O
: O
and O
, O
in O
company O
, O
he O
felt O
almost O
as O
much O
ashamed O
of O
her O
, O
as O
Lady B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
herself O
. O
But O
he O
could O
not O
mistake O
her O
love O
and O
true O
affection O
, O
nor O
resist O
the O
charm O
of O
feeling O
that O
at O
least O
there O
was O
one O
being O
in O
existence O
, O
who O
would O
have O
cherished O
him O
, O
even O
if O
he O
had O
not O
been O
the O
great O
man O
he O
was O
. O
In O
private O
he O
scrupled O
not O
to O
yield O
to O
this O
feeling O
, O
and O
certainly O
derived O
considerable O
pleasure O
from O
it O
| | O
but O
before O
witnesses O
, O
he O
always O
joined O
in O
the O
family O
tone O
respecting O
" O
poor O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
" O
and O
scrupled O
not O
to O
push O
her O
on O
one S-CARDINAL
side O
, O
upon O
all O
occasions O
on O
which O
any O
display O
of O
Dowling S-PERSON
elegance O
was O
contemplated O
. O
It O
was O
this O
ugly O
Martha B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
who O
now O
startled O
little O
Michael S-PERSON
with O
her O
voice O
of O
kindness O
, O
and O
, O
notwithstanding O
all O
her O
lady O
mother O
said O
about O
the O
" O
horrid O
vulgarity O
of O
her O
manners O
, O
" O
poor O
Martha S-PERSON
had O
a O
sweet O
and O
gentle O
voice O
. O
The O
child O
looked O
up O
at O
her O
, O
and O
with O
the O
weakness O
that O
appeared O
constitutionally O
peculiar O
to O
him O
, O
his O
eyes O
were O
immediately O
filled O
with O
tears O
. O
Yet O
Michael S-PERSON
was O
not O
a O
whimpering O
boy O
either O
| | O
many O
had O
seen O
him O
harshly O
treated O
, O
for O
he O
had O
worked O
almost O
from O
babyhood O
in O
the O
cotton O
- O
factory O
, O
but O
nobody O
had O
ever O
seen O
him O
cry O
under O
it O
. O
But O
if O
his O
mother O
, O
or O
his O
poor O
sickly O
brother O
, O
touched O
his O
little O
heart O
, O
either O
with O
joy O
or O
tenderness O
, O
he O
would O
weep O
and O
laugh O
both O
, O
with O
very O
infantine O
susceptibility O
. O
So O
it O
was O
with O
him O
now O
, O
for O
when O
Martha S-PERSON
added O
with O
a O
good O
- O
humoured O
smile O
, O
" O
And O
what O
brings O
you O
here O
, O
Master O
Armstrong S-PERSON
? O
" O
he O
laughed O
outright O
as O
he O
replied O
, O
" O
Indeed O
, O
ma'am O
, O
I O
ain't O
Master O
Armstrong S-PERSON
, O
and O
I O
don't O
know O
a O
bit O
what O
I O
be O
here O
for O
. O
" O
This O
speech O
, O
though O
addressed O
to O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
being O
heard O
by O
all O
, O
the O
contrast O
between O
his O
appearance O
and O
his O
language O
considerably O
excited O
the O
curiosity O
of O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
eldest O
Miss O
Dowlings S-PERSON
. O
" O
La O
! O
how O
he O
talks O
! O
I O
thought O
he O
was O
a O
gentleman O
by O
his O
jacket O
, O
didn't O
you O
, O
Arabella S-PERSON
? O
" O
said O
Miss O
Harriet S-PERSON
. O
" O
Yes O
to O
be O
sure O
I O
did O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
eldest O
sister O
. O
" O
But O
I O
am O
sure O
he O
is O
not O
, O
with O
that O
horrid O
way O
of O
speaking O
, O
what O
did O
you O
bring O
him O
here O
for O
Peggy S-PERSON
? O
" O
continued O
the O
young O
lady O
with O
an O
air O
of O
authority O
. O
" O
Because O
master O
bid O
me O
, O
miss O
, O
" O
was O
the O
satisfactory O
reply O
. O
" O
Well O
to O
be O
sure O
, O
that O
is O
queer O
! O
I O
suppose O
he's O
the O
son O
of O
somebody O
or O
other O
, O
or O
papa O
would O
never O
have O
sent O
him O
in O
to O
us O

It O
is O
not O
at O
all O
his O
way O
to O
patronise O
vulgarity O
. O
Where O
do O
you O
live O
, O
young O
gentleman O
? O
" O
Michael S-PERSON
looked O
very O
much O
as O
if O
he O
were O
in O
danger O
of O
laughing O
again O
, O
but O
he O
did O
not O
, O
and O
replied O
very O
demurely O
, O
" O
in O
Mr. O
Sykes's S-PERSON
back O

" O
to O
Martha S-PERSON
as O
he O
uttered O
it O
, O
as O
if O
anxious O
to O
see O
how O
she O
bore O
it O
, O
but O
he O
encountered O
a O
look O
that O
altogether O
puzzled O
him O

for O
though O
it O
was O
at O
least O
as O
kind O
as O
before O
, O
there O
was O
uneasiness O
in O
it O
, O

she O
looked O
round O
her O
, O
as O
if O
uncomfortably O
doubtful O
of O
what O
would O
happen O
next O

She O
did O
not O

wait O
long O

the O
result O

for O
Miss O

the O
three S-CARDINAL
middling O

sized O
Miss O
Dowlings S-PERSON

who O
had O
approached O
very O
near O
to O
the O
little O
boy O

were O
even O
growing O
so O
familiar O
that O
Miss O
Charlotte S-PERSON
had O
taken O
hold O
of O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
his O
dark O
curls O

were O
severally O

suddenly O
drawn O
off O

he O
get O
his O
clothes O
from O

" O
interrogated O
Miss O
Harriet S-PERSON
. O
" O
Most O
likely O
he O
stole O
them O
, O
" O
responded O
Miss O
Arabella S-PERSON
. O
" O
Why O
' O
tis O
Duodecimus's O
jacket O

" O
ejaculated O
the O
observing O
Miss O
Charlotte S-PERSON
. O
" O
Oh O
! O
quelle O
horreur O
! O
" O
cried O
the O
governess O
driving O
her O
pupils O
all O
before O
her O
to O
the O
other O
end O
of O
the O
room O
. O
At O
this O
moment O
, O
and O
before O
any O
more O
active O
measures O
could O
be O
resorted O
to O
for O
the O
safety O
of O
the O
young O
ladies O
, O
the O
door O
of O
the O
school O
- O
room O
was O
again O
thrown O
open O
, O
and O
the O
portly O
person O
of O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
appeared O
at O
it O
, O
accompanied O
by O
the O
globe O
- O
like O
figure O
of O
Doctor O
Crockley S-PERSON
. O
" O
Good O
morning O
young O
ladies O
! O
" O
said O
the O
proud O
father O
, O
looking O
round O
him O
, O
and O
immediately O
entering O
into O
the O
jest O
that O
he O
saw O
was O
afloat O
. O
" O
How O
do O
you O
like O
the O
young O
beau O
I O
have O
sent O
you O
? O
" O
" O
Good O
gracious O
, O
papa O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
the O
elegant O
and O
much O
admired O
Miss O
Arabella S-PERSON
, O
" O
he O
is O
a O
beggar O
- O
boy O
and O
a O
thief O
! O
" O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
and O
his O
friend O
Doctor B-PERSON
Crockley E-PERSON
, O
both O
burst O
into O
such O
a O
shout O
of O
laughter O
at O
this O
sally O
, O
that O
it O
was O
a O
minute O
before O
either O
of O
them O
could O
speak O
| | O
but O
at O
length O
the O
knight O
, O
turning O
to O
the O
doctor O
, O
said O
, O
" O
Leave O
my O
girls O
alone O
, O
Crockley S-PERSON
, O
for O
finding O
out O
what's O
what O
| | O
I O
don't O
believe O
there's O
one O
of O
them O
but O
what O
would O
have O
found O
that O
fellow O
out O
, O
if O
I O
had O
wrapped O
him O
up O
in O
the O
king's O
own O
mantle O
. O
" O
" O
They O
are O
sharp O
enough O
, O
there O
is O
no O
doubt O
of O
that O
, O
" O
replied O
his O
friend O
, O
" O
but O
I O
must O
say O
you O
don't O
perform O
your O
charitable O
acts O
by O
halves O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
. O
You O
have O
dressed O
up O
the O
little O
scamp O
so O
superbly O
, O
that O
nothing O
but O
the O
vulgar O
dark O
complexion O
could O
make O
one O
know O
that O
he O
was O
not O
one O
of O
your O
own O
. O
" O
" O
Why O
yes O
, O
there O
is O
some O
difference O
in O
the O
skins O
I O
must O
say O
, O
" O
replied O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
looking O
with O
most O
parental O
complacency O
on O
the O
fair O
skins O
, O
flaxen O
hair O
, O
and O
light O
eyelashes O
of O
his O
race O
. O
with O
the O
condition O
, O
and O
, O
that O
the O
influence O
of O
wealth O
and O
consequence O
is O
as O
quickly O
shown O
upon O
the O
external O
appearance O
of O
men O
, O
women O
, O
and O
children O
, O
as O
a O
field O
of O
clover O
upon O
the O
inferior O
animals O
. O
And O
why O
not O
? O
It O
is O
quite O
natural O
— O
perfectly O
conformable O
to O
the O
analogy O
, O
that O
, O
by O
accurately O
tracing O
cause O
and O
effect O
, O
may O
be O
followed O
through O
all O
creation O
. O
You O
have O
a O
head O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
for O
that O
sort O
of O
thing O
: O
you O
can O
understand O
me O
, O
if O
nobody O
else O
can O
. O
" O
The O
little O
doctor O
knew O
that O
this O
was O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
soft O
points O
at O
which O
his O
wealthy O
neighbour O
was O
assailable O
. O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
loved O
to O
be O
assured O
that O
his O
head O
was O
of O
a O
superior O
fabric O
. O
" O
But O
why O
, O
papa O
, O
should O
you O
send O
a O
nasty O
beggar O
- O
boy O
to O
us O
, O
with O
Duo's O
clothes O
on O
? O
" O
inquired O
the O
intelligent O
Louisa S-PERSON
. O
Before O
he O
replied O
to O
this O
, O
the O
knight O
exchanged O
a O
glance O
with O
his O
friend O
, O
which O
seemed O
to O
say O
, O
" O
that's O
the O
right O
sort O
— O
she's O
in O
the O
clover O
- O
field O
. O
" O
" O
I O
have O
taken O
him O
in O
for O
charity O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
knight O
, O
with O
a O
sort O
of O
pomposity O
that O
seemed O
of O
a O
new O
pattern O
. O
The O
young O
ladies O
had O
never O
seen O
papa O
look O
so O
before O
. O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
from O
having O
found O
herself O
rather O
more O
frequently O
the O
object O
of O
Dr. O
Crockley's S-PERSON
jokes O
than O
she O
desired O
, O
had O
, O
on O
his O
entering O
the O
room O
, O
retired O
to O
the O
window O
, O
but O
now O
she O
came O
up O
to O
her O
father O
, O
and O
quietly O
, O
and O
as O
often O
happened O
, O
almost O
unnoticed O
, O
kissed O
his O
hand O
. O
For O
charity O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
the O
fair O
- O
haired O
Arabella S-PERSON
, O
moving O
a O
step O
or O
two S-CARDINAL
farther O
away O
from O
the O
object O
of O
this O
extraordinary O
caprice O
. O
" O
La O
Papa O
! O
why O
don't O
you O
send O
him O
to O
the O
hospital O
? O
" O
Doctor O
Crockley S-PERSON
laughed O
outrageously O
. O
" O
That O
girl O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
when O
he O
had O
recovered O
his O
voice O
, O
" O
that O
girl O
is O
beyond O
all O
comparison O
the O
most O
thoroughly O

born O
lady O

ever O
I O
happened O
to O

upon O

that O
is O
saying O
something O

I O
promise O
you O
. O
She O
hasn't O
a O
commonplace O
vulgar O
notion O
in O
her O
from O
top O
to O
toe O
. O
It O
is O
what O
I O
call O
the O
physiology O
of O
wealth O
— O
it O
is O
upon O
my O
soul O
— O
it O
is O
a O
study O
, O
a O
science O
. O
I O
have O
not O
got O
to O
the O
end O
of O
it O
, O
but O
I O
am O
certain O
I O
shall O
make O
a O
system O
out O
of O
it O
— O
and O
you'll O
be O
able O
to O
follow O
me O

some O
comfort O
in O
that O

declare O
to O
God O

that O
if O

found O
you O

should O
have O
bolted O

my O
mind O

superior O
intellect O

find O
that O
, O
too O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
I'm O
sure O
you O
do O
. O
" O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
assured O
him O
that O
he O
did O
, O
very O
much O

and O
then O
pulling O
a O
Belinda S-PERSON
lock O
that O
adorned O
the O
olive O
- O
coloured O
throat O
of O
Mademoiselle B-PERSON

asked O
her O
if O
she O
had O
ever O
seen O
a O
brat O
, O
taken O
in O
for O
charity O

" O
Whilst O
the O
French S-NORP
governess O
struggled O
to O
find O
a O
word O
sufficiently O
expressive O
of O
admiration O
, O
and O
if O
possible O
, O
with O
some O
little O
meaning O
besides O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
took O
the O
liberty O
of O
pinching O
her O
ear O
, O
while O
he O
whispered O
into O
it O
, O
" O
What O
, O
you O
little O
rogue O
? O
what O
? O
" O
She O
gave O
him O
a O
Parisian S-NORP
æillade O
demanded O
" O

little O

" O
This O
question O

repeated O
nearly O
in O
the O
same O
words O
by O
Mademoiselle B-PERSON
Beaujoie E-PERSON
to O
the O
knight O
, O
appeared O
to O
cause O
him O
some O
perplexity O
, O
and O
, O
after O
reflecting O
upon O
it O
for O
a B-TIME
minute E-TIME
, O
he O
turned O
to O
consult O
his O
philosophical O
friend O
. O
" O
I O
say O
Crockley S-PERSON
, O
what O
do O
you O
think O
of O
that O
? O
" O
Then O
lowering O
his O
voice O
, O
he O
added O
, O
" O
you O
comprehend O
the O
job O

will O

replied O
his O
friend O
, O
in O
the O

low O
tone O

very O
decisively O
. O
" O
No O

the O
round O

Here O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
broke O
off O
in O
some O
degree O
of O
embrrassment O

not O

particularly O
to O
impress O

his O
tender O

notice O

he O
passed O
all O

over O
very O
skilfully O

ended O
his O
harangue O

so O
amiable O

the O
benevolence O

warms O
my O
heart O

will O
communicate O
itself O
to O

" O
Lady B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
raised O
her O
light O
eyebrows O
, O
and O
her O
still O
lighter O
eyelashes O
, O
into O
a O
look O
of O
the O
most O
unmitigated O
astonishment O
, O
and O
remained O
thus O
for O
a O
while O
, O
contemplating O
the O
extraordinary O
spectacle O
, O
of O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
handsomest O
boys O
she O
had O
ever O
seen O
, O
dressed O
in O
a O
style O
of O
unquestionable O
fashion O
, O
and O
presented O
to O
her O
as O
a O
being O
so O
deplorably O
miserable O
, O
as O
to O
have O
excited O
the O
pity O
of O
her O
husband O
. O
The O
first S-ORDINAL
clear O
and O
distinct O
idea O
that O
suggested O
itself O
was O
, O
the O
necessity O
of O
inquiring O
respecting O
this O
beautiful O
child's O
mother O
, O
and O
of O
finding O
out O
whether O
she O
might O
not O
happen O
to O
be O
beautiful O
too O
| | O
the O
next O
arose O
from O
the O
sudden O
recognition O
of O
her O
own O
son's O
own O
clothes O
, O
and O
the O
complexion O
of O
the O
lady O
became O
extremely O
florid O
. O
" O
" O
I O
should O
like O
to O
know O
where O
he O
got O
those O
clothes O
from O
, O
" O
she O
said O
in O
accents O
that O
by O
no O
means O
spoke O
composure O
of O
spirit O
. O
" O
My O
dearest O
love O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
most O
amiable O
and O
the O
most O
polite O
of O
husbands O
, O
" O
that O
is O
entirely O
my O
doing O
. O
You O
have O
known O
me O
long O
enough O

my O
sweetest O

to O
be O
aware O
that O
I O
never O
do O
any O
thing O

I O
saw O
that O
little O
fellow O
ragged O

wretched O

I O
clothed O
him O

I O
must O
say O

I O
do O

began O
her O
ladyship O
, O
when O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
seating O
himself O
at O
the O
table O
, O
thrust O
a O
knife O
and O
fork O
into O
the O
very O
centre O
of O
a O
pigeon O
- O
pie O
, O
and O
accompanied O
the O
act O
by O
a O
sound O
, O
something O
between O
a O
slight O
cough O
and O
a O
grunt O
, O
which O
, O
in O
language O
matrimonial O
, O
was O
known O
to O
mean O
, O
" O
You O
had O
better O
hold O
your O
tongue O
and O
mind O
your O
business O
. O
" O
Whereupon O
, O
Lady B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
sat O
down O
too O
, O
but O
her O
fair O
complexion O
was O
rather O
more O
rosy O
than O
was O
becoming O
, O
and O
it O
was O
in O
no O
very O
sweet O
voice O
that O
she O
said O
to O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
who O
ventured O
to O
take O
a O
chair O
next O
her O
, O
" O
Do O
get O
a O
little O
farther O
, O
child O
can't O
you O
? O
— O
You O
know O
I O
hate O

crushed O

crammed O
up O
so O
. O
" O
Here O
Dr. O
Crockley S-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
already O
fallen O
with O
vehemence O
upon O
a O
cold O
ham O
, O
stopped O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
and O
laughed O
vehemently O
. O
" O
My O
dear O
madam O
, O
you O
are O
of O
the O
slight O
and O
elegant O

yourself O

you O
don't O
make O
allowance O
for O
poor O
people O
who O
are O
as O
fat O

roundabout O
as O
Miss O

I O

we O
can't O
squeeze O
ourselves O
into O
an O
eggshell O
, O
Miss O

, O
can O
we O
? O
" O
Her O
slim O
sisters O
tittered O
, O
and O
the O
witty O
Augustus S-PERSON
observed O
, O
that O
" O
To O
be O
sure O
, O
Martha S-PERSON
did O
look O
more O
like O
a O
collar O
of O
Oxford S-GPE
brawn O
, O
than O
any O
thing O
else O
in O
creation O

" O
Meanwhile O
, O
the O
meal O
proceeded O
, O
and O
little O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
continued O
to O
stand O
half O
- O
way O
between O
the O
door O
and O
the O
table O
, O
as O
fixedly O
as O
if O
he O
had O
taken O
root O
there O
. O
Martha S-PERSON
was O
, O
in O
general O
, O
very O
philosophically O
inclined O
to O
let O
all O
things O
round O
her O
take O
their O
course O
| | O
but O
she O
sat O
exactly O
opposite O
to O
the O
object O
of O
her O
father's O
benevolence O
, O
and O
there O
was O
something O
in O
the O
expression O
of O
his O
eye O
, O
as O
it O
rested O
upon O
the O
dainties O
before O
him O
, O
that O
was O
more O
than O
she O
could O
bear O
. O
" O
May O
I O
give O
the O
little O
boy O
something O
to O
eat O
, O
papa O
? O
" O
said O
she O
addressing O
her O
father O
in O
a O
timid O
voice O
. O
" O
How O
shall O
we O
manage O
about O
that O
, O
Crockley S-PERSON
? O
" O
whispered O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
into O
the O
ear O
of O
the O
doctor O
who O
sat O
close O
to O
him O
. O
" O
Cram O
him O
, O
cram O
him O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
. O
— O
You'll O
find O
it O
like O
oil O
on O
the O
surface O
of O
water O
, O
spreading O
far O
and O
wide O
, O
" O
replied O
his O
counsellor O
, O
whispering O
in O
return O
, O
" O
Let O
the O
boy O
have O
to O
boast O
of O
his O
high O
feeding O
, O
and O
it O
will O
do O
more O
good O
than O
if O
you O
were O
to O
endow O
him O
with O
lands O
and O
houses O
, O
and O
keep O
him O
lean O
. O
" O
" O
Say O
you O
so O
, O
my O
wise O
man O
! O
Faith O
, O
then O
, O
the O
matter O
is O
easy O
enough O
, O
for O
I O
believe O
Dowling B-PERSON
Lodge E-PERSON
is O
rather O
celebrated O
for O
its O
superfluity O
of O
good O
cheer O
. O
We'll O
have O
him O
gasping O
with O
indigestion O
within O
a O
week O
, O
see O
if O
we O
don't O
. O
" O
Then O
raising O
his O
voice O
, O
he O
answered O
the O
petition O
of O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
by O
repeating O
her O
words O
, O
" O
May O
you O
give O
the O
little O
boy O
something O
to O
eat O
? O
" O
and O
then O
added O
with O
a O
laugh O
, O
" O
By O
all O
manner O
of O
means O
, O
Miss O
Martha S-PERSON

and O
, O
" O
taking O
some O
halfdemolished O
fragments O
off O
his O
own O
plate O
, O
" O
he O
may O
boast O

well O

And O
so O
saying O
, O
the O
benevolent O
owner O
of O
Dowlig B-ORG
Lodge E-ORG
skilfully O
cut O
the O
air O
with O
half S-CARDINAL

pigeon O
, O

, O
taking O
exactly O
the O
direction O
he O
intended O

struck O
Michael S-PERSON
in O
the O
middle O
of O
his O
forehead O

Whatever O
might O

the O
effect O

this O
liberality O
of O
heart O

hand O
out O

Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
had O
every O
reason O
to O
be O
satisfied O
with O
the O
result O
within O

whole O

burst O
into O
a O
simultaneous O
shout O

delight O

while O
Dr. O

clapped O
his O
hands O

vociferated O
, O
" O

as O
loud O

the O

Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON

with O
a O
stride O
which O
, O
for O
the O
vigorous O
distance O
it O
carried O
him O

might O
have O
been O
compared O
to O
that O
of O

knave O

his O
slender O

attached O

the O

" O
better O
to O
sit O
down O
to O
talk O

but O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
was O
greatly O
too O
much O
amused O
by O
what O
was O
passing O
to O
hear O
her O

for O
Miss O
Mogg S-PERSON

her O
patroness O
stood O

was O
quiet O
out O
of O
the O
question O

that O
Lady B-PERSON

, O
and O
the O
too O
eldest O
Miss O
Dowlings S-PERSON
, O
continued O
to O
stand O
like O
three S-CARDINAL
finely O
- O
dressed O
flaxen O
- O
headed O
statues O
, O
to O
the O
end O
of O
it O

Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
than O
led O
the O
high O
- O
born O
lady O
to O
a O
chair O
, O
while O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
perceiving O
that O
her O
conversation O
with O
the O
knight O
was O
now O
reduced O
to O
a O
whisper O
, O
and O
that O
consequently O
there O
would O
be O
no O
more O
fun O
in O
listening O
to O
it O
, O
condescended O
at O
last O
to O
answer O
a O
few O
of O
the O
amiable O
inquiries O
after O
her O
health O
, O
which O
were O
addressed O
to O
her O
by O
Mr. O
Augustus S-PERSON
and O
his O
two S-CARDINAL
sisters O
. O
Meanwhile O
, O
the O
young O
Norval S-PERSON
, O
with O
pensive O
eye O
intent O
on O
nature's O
beauties O
, O
stole O
his O
way O
to O
the O
open O
window O
, O
and O
there O
having O
twice O
or O
thrice O
passed O
his O
fingers O
through O
his O
long O
locks O
, O
which O
descendedlin O
disordered O
curls O
almost O
to O
his O
shoulders O
, O
and O
once O
and O
again O
buttoned O
and O
unbuttoned O
the O
broad O
shirt O
- O
collar O
which O
fell O
back O
, O
unrestrained O
by O
that O
most O
unintellectual O
ligature O
, O
a O
cravat O
, O
remained O
partly O
, O
it O
might O
be O
, O
to O
let O
the O
young O
ladies O
look O
at O
him O
, O
and O
partly O
to O
receive O
the O
fragrant O
breeze O
of O
summer O
upon O
his O
brow O
. O
It O
was O
now O
that O
Dr. O
Crockley S-PERSON
felt O
he O
was O
called O
upon O
to O
do O
something O
that O
might O
bring O
him O
into O
notice O
, O
and O
waddling O
up O
to O
the O
young O
poet O
, O
he O
addressed O
him O
with O
an O
air O
of O
incipient O
friendship O
which O
seemed O
to O
say O
, O
" O
And O
I O
too O
am O
somebody O
. O
" O
" O
You O
will O
find O
this O
neighbourhood O
not O
very O
prolific O
, O
young O
gentleman O
, O
in O
such O
gifts O
of O
intellect O
as O
a O
poet O
requires O
in O
order O
to O
be O
duly O
appreciated O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
I O
will O
not O
deny O
that O
there O
is O
amongst O
us O
a O
knot O
, O
a O
little O
knot O
, O
Mr. O
Norval S-PERSON
, O
whom O
, O
upon O
further O
acquaintance O
, O
you O
may O
find O
not O
altogether O
uncongenial O
. O
For O
myself O
, O
I O
may O
venture O
to O
say O
, O
that O
I O
am O
as O
warmly O
devoted O
to O
every O
subject O
, O
directly O
or O
indirectly O
, O
connected O
with O
the O
divine O
, O
ethereal O
, O
immaterial O
, O
intellectual O
part O
of O
our O
composite O
formation O
, O
as O
it O
is O
possible O
for O
a O
man O
to O
be O
, O
and O
it O
will O
give O
me O
pleasure O
, O
sir O
, O
to O
make O
your O
acquaintance O
. O
" O
As O
this O
was O
spoken O
with O
energy O
, O
the O
sultry O
season O
made O
itself O
felt O
under O
the O
exertion O
, O
and O
Dr. O
Crockley S-PERSON
found O
it O
necessary O
so O
far O
to O
remember O
the O
viler O
portion O
of O
his O
composite O
formation O
, O
as O
to O
wipe O
his O
face O
and O
bald O
head O
assiduously O
. O
The O
poet O
bowed O
, O
but O
not O
as O
he O
had O
bowed O
to O
Lady O
Clarissa S-PERSON

Meanwhile O

, O
her O
light O
- O
coloured O
daughters O

Miss O

sat O
profoundly O
silent O
upon O
two S-CARDINAL

one S-CARDINAL
sofa O
of O
the O
splendid O
apartment O

Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
and O
Mr. O
Augustus S-PERSON
continued O
to O
talk O
about O
nothing O
, O
and O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
and O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa E-PERSON
ceased O
not O
to O
mutter O
, O
what O
none O
but O
themselves O
could O
hear O
, O
upon O
an O
ottoman O
, O
which O
stood O
in O
front O
of O
a O
distant O
window O

If O

have O
interrupted O

continued O

proceed O
undisturbed O

for O
the O
mistress O
of O

did O
certainly O
cast O
not O
a O
few O
anxious O
glances O
towards O
the O
master O

it O

it O
was O
not O
for O
that O
reason O
that O
he O
at O
length O
got O
up O
and O
rather O
hastily O
left O
the O
room O

While O
all O
this O
was O
passing O
in O
the O
drawing O

Martha B-PERSON

beneficent O

hit O
the O
forehead O

highly O

very O
moment O

itself O
heard O

the O
greatly O
amused O
company O

the O
room O

it O
was O
possible O
to O
ascertain O
what O

having O
done O
so O
, O
held O
it O
by O
one S-CARDINAL
leg O
with O
an O
air O
of O
very O
comical O
indecision O
, O
till O
Dr. O
Crockley S-PERSON
, O
who O
respectfully O
walked O
the O
last O
out O
of O
the O
room O

shut O
the O

The O
eyes O

the O

met O

Michael S-PERSON
opened O
his O
magnificent O
black O
eyes O
, O
and O
looked O
earnestly O
at O
her O
. O
He O
approached O
the O
table O
, O
laid O
down O
the O
half S-CARDINAL
- O
dissected O
pigeon O

said O
not O
a O
word O

you O

smiling O
at O
him O

returning O
the O
smile O

some O
another O

generally O
like O
something O
very O
sweet O

some O

you O

the O
child O

blushing O
violently O

What O
shall O
it O
be O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
? O
" O
This O
arrangement O
seemed O
to O
put O
the O
boy O
into O
a O
state O
of O
perfect O
ecstasy O

he O
clapped O
his O
hands O

raised O
one S-CARDINAL
foot O

then O
the O
other O
, O
with O
childish O
glee O

exclaimed O
in O
an O
accent O
from O
which O
all O
timidity O
had O
fled O
, O
" O
Oh O

" O

you O
love O

said O
Martha S-PERSON

drawing O
the O

towards O
her O

kissing O
his O
smooth O
dark O

Michael S-PERSON
nodded O
his O
head O

nestled O
closer O

being O
in O
excellent O

he O
sat O
down O

began O
to O

had O
made O
her O
exit O

opened O
, O
and O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
walked O
in O

Michael's S-PERSON
knife O
and O
active O
fingers O
remained O
suspended O
midway O
between O
his O
mouth O
and O
the O
plate O
| | O
the O
colour O
forsook O
his O
cheek O
, O
and O
his O
eye O
sunk O
as O
if O
unable O
to O
meet O
that O
of O
his O
munificent O
patron O
. O
" O
What O
stuffing O
still O
, O
you O
greedy O
little O
rascal O
? O
What O
have O
you O
touched O
with O
your O
nasty O
factory O
fingers O
? O
Not O
the O
grapes O
, O
I O
hope O
? O
" O
Michael S-PERSON
tried O
to O
say O
" O
no O
, O
" O
but O
did O
not O
succeed O
in O
producing O
the O
sound O
| | O
so O
contented O
himself O
by O
letting O
the O
forefinger O
of O
his O
left O
hand O
drop O
into O
his O
plate O
to O
show O
how O
he O
had O
been O
engaged O
. O
" O
Don't S-PERSON
look O
so O
like O
a O
fool O
, O
you O
oaf O
, O
" O
said O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
taking O
him O
by O
the O
shoulder O
, O
and O
shaking O
him O
with O
some O
vivacity O
. O
" O
You O
are O
to O
come O
along O
with O
me O
, O
do O
you O
hear O
that O
? O
and O
see O
a O
lot O
of O
fine O
folks O
, O
and O
to O
look O
up O
at O
them O
too O
, O
do O
you O
hear O
that O

and O
by O
G O
— O
d O
if O
you O
blubber O
, O
or O
look O
grumpish O
, O
I'll O
have O
you O
strapped O
ten S-CARDINAL
times O
over O
, O
worse O
than O
you O
ever O
saw O
done O
at O
the O
factory O

Come O
along O
! O
— O
and O
mind O
what O
I O
have O
promised O

for O
I'll O
keep O
it O
, O
and O
worse O
, O
that O
you O
may O
rely O
. O
" O
Michael S-PERSON
behaved O
like O
a O
little O
hero O
. O
He O
remembered O
the O
promised O
basket O
, O
and O
the O
voice O
that O
had O
told O
him O
he O
should O
have O
it O
| | O
he O
remembered O
Hoxley S-PERSON
- O
lane O
too O
, O
and O
his O
mother O
, O
and O
Teddy S-PERSON
, O
and O
their O
morsel O
of O
dry O
bread O
| | O
so O
he O
walked O
manfully O
along O
beside O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
and O
when O
they O
reached O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
door O
, O
and O
his O
benefactor O
stretched O
forth O
a O
hand O
to O
take O
his O
, O
he O
yielded O
it O
to O
him O
, O
with O
scarcely O
any O
perceptible O
shudder O
. O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
walked O
some O
steps O
forward O
, O
with O
the O
boy O
in O
his O
hand O
, O
into O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
, O
and O
then O
standing O
quite O
still O
, O
pointed O
to O
the O
child O
, O
and O
said O
, O
" O
Lady O
Clarissa S-PERSON
! O
behold O
the O
factory O
- O
boy O
! O
" O
Nothing O
could O
be O
more O
skilful O
than O
this O
form O
of O
presentation O
, O
for O
it O
told O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa E-PERSON
every O
thing O
, O
and O
Lady B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
nothing O
. O
Lady O
Clarissa S-PERSON
sprung O
from O
her O
seat O
and O
ran O
towards O
the O
child O
. O
" O
Is O
it O
possible O
! O
" O
she O
exclaimed O
, O
with O
every O
appearance O
of O
violent O
emotion O
. O
" O
Oh O
! O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
! O
" O
these O
last O
words O
were O
audible O
only O
to O
the O
knight O
and O
the O
little O
boy O

but O
as O
the O
latter O
could O
make O
nothing O
of O
them O
, O
and O
the O
former O
almost O
any O
thing O
he O
pleased O
, O
it O
was O
evident O
that O
the O
lady O
was O
as O
well O
skilled O
in O
saying O
more O
than O
met O
the O
ear O
, O
as O
the O
gentleman O
. O
" O
Indeed O
, O
indeed O
, O
" O
said O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa E-PERSON
, O
drawing O
forth O
another O
of O
the O
coronetted O
handkerchiefs O
, O
" O

is O

noble O
act O

! O
" O
Here O
her O
ladyship O
pressed O
her O
handkerchief O
to O
her O
eyes O
, O
and O
remained O
in O
the O
eloquent O
silence O
of O
that O
position O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
then O
raising O
herself O
from O
the O
softness O
that O
, O
as O
she O
hinted O
to O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
whisper O
, O
she O
felt O
stealing O
upon O
her O
, O
she O
called O
to O
Mr. O
Osmond B-PERSON
Norval E-PERSON
, O

said O
in O
a O
tone O
audible O

look O
at O
the O
delicate O
air O
of O
aristocratic O
refinement O

pervades O
his O
person O

Osmond S-PERSON

not O
made O
her O
daily O
circuit O
round O
the O
sun O

I O
beheld O
this O
child O
the O
very O
type O
of O
sordid O
wretchedness O

would O
you O
know O
the O
hand O
that O
wrought O
this O
wondrous O
change O

Would O
you O
learn O
what O
heart O
suggested O
it O
? O
Behold O
them O
here O
! O
" O
and O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa E-PERSON
laid O
her O
noble O
fingers O
on O
the O
coat O
- O
sleeve O
of O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
. O
" O
Her O
ladyship O

Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
no O
more O
than O
justice O
Mr. O
Norval S-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
Doctor O
Crockley S-PERSON
approaching O
the O
group O
. O
" O
This O
is O
an O
act O
that O
ought O
to O
be O
given O
to O
fame O
, O
and O
, O
if O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
himself O
does O
not O
object O
to O
it O
, O
I O
would O
suggest O
its O
being O
recorded O
by O
your O
pen O
, O
in O
such O
a O
form O
as O
may O
give O
it O
general O
circulation O

The O
poet O
pressed O
his O
hand O
upon O
his O
heart O
, O
and O
bowed O
profoundly O
, O
and O
then O
, O
raising O
the O
other O
hand O
to O
his O
forehead O
, O
he O
stood O
for O
some O
time O
silently O
meditating O
on O
the O
theme O
thus O
offered O
to O
him O
. O
During O
this O
interval O
, O
the O
different O
groups O
which O
surrounded O
him O
formed O
a O
most O
charming O
picture O

The O
young O
man O
himself O
stood O
apart O
, O
and O
unconsciously O
, O
perhaps O
, O
became O
the O
centre O
to O
which O
every O
eye O
- O
beam O
converged O

by O

, O
at O
no O
great O
distance O
from O

awaited O
his O
reply O

her O
ladyship O
with O
an O
affectionate O
smile O
on O
her O

confidence O

power O

will O
to O
do O
what O

him O

Sir O
Matthew's S-PERSON
expression O
of O
countenance O
could O
not O
be O
read O
so O
plainly O

it O
was O
grave O
, O
but O
it O
might O
be O
doubtful O
whether O
its O
gravity O
proceeded O
from O
displeasure O
that O
the O
answer O
should O
be O
delayed O
, O
or O
solely O
from O
the O
deep O
interest O

more O

straight O
forward O

with O
their O
four S-CARDINAL

fixed O
upon O

violently O
in O

In O
a O
deep O
arm O

almost O
buried O
herself O

lay O

little O
Miss O

almost O
convulsed O
with O
laughter O

with O
her O
pocket O

handkerchief O
by O
no O

elegantly O
applied O

her O
mouth O

being O
nearly O
half O

little O
behind O

neither O

perched O
very O
insecurely O
on O

extreme O
edge O

a O
couch O

which O
uncomfortable O
attitude O
she O
had O
chosen O
from O

quite O
certain O
whether O
she O
ought O
to O
stand O
like O

sit O
like O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON

first S-ORDINAL

feared O
was O
too O
dignified O
and O
distinguished O
for O
her O
| | O
the O
last O
too O
comfortable O
, O
and O
she O
deserved O
credit O
for O
hitting O
upon O
a O
position O
so O
far O
removed O
from O
either O

lastly O
, O
very O
near O
the O
door O

entered O

he O
had O
slunk O
back O

picturesque O
state O
of O
things O
having O
lasted O
quite O
long O
enough O
, O
Osmond B-PERSON
Norval E-PERSON
raised O
his O
eyes O
from O
the O
ground O
to O
the O
face O
of O
Lady O
Clarissa S-PERSON
, O
and O
making O
a O
sudden O
step O
forwards O
, O
dropped O
on O
one S-CARDINAL
knee O
and O
seized O
her O
hand O
. O
He O
attempted O
to O
speak O
, O

for O
some O
time O
his O
voice O
appeared O
perfectly O
choked O
by O
emotion O
. O
At O
last O
, O
however O
, O
he O
recovered O
the O
power O
of O
articulation O

said O
, O
" O

to O
Mr. O

most O
important O
inquiry O

Lady O
Clarissa S-PERSON
suddenly O
clapped O
her O
hands O
together O
with O
a O
sort O
of O
vehement O
enthusiasm O
that O
looked O
very O
like O
delirium O

Even O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
though O
his O
intimacy O
with O
her O
had O
more O
than O

made O
him O
the O
witness O
to O
some O
extraordinary O
freaks O

looked O
at O

astonishment O

were O
more O
widely O

instinctively O
thrust O
her O
hand O
into O
her O

in O
search O
of O

took O
her O

out O
of O

looked O

Poor O

Gracious O

Sir O

! O
what O
would O
become O
of O
my O
etherealized O
spirit O

were O
so O
encumbered O

freedom O

" O
Thus O
conjured O
, O
every O
one O
in O
the O

, O
except O
Lady B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
, O
who O
stirred O
not O
an O
inch O
, O
drew O
round O
the O
place O
where O
Lady O
Clarissa S-PERSON
had O
seated O
herself O
, O
and O
prepared O
with O
considerable O
curiosity O
to O
hear O
what O
she O
was O
going O
to O
say O
. O
" O
Is O
not O
amusement O
the O
very O
soul O
of O
life O

" O
she O
began O
. O
" O
No O
doubt O
of O
it O
, O
my O
lady O
, O
" O
from O
the O
lips O
of O
Dr. O
Crockley S-PERSON
, O
was O
the O
most O
articulate O
of O
the O
many O
acquiescent O
answers O
which O
followed O
. O
" O
Is O
not O
a O
country O
neighbourhood O
fearfully O
, O
lamentably O
difficient O
in O
this O
? O
" O
pursued O
the O
animated O
inquirer O
. O
" O
There O
cannot O
be O
two S-CARDINAL
opinions O
on O
that O
point O
, O
" O
replied O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
with O
authority O
. O
" O
And O
is O
it O
not O
the O
duty O
of O
neighbours O
, O
residing O
within O
reach O
of O
each O
other O
as O
we O
do O
, O

exert O
every O
facility O
with O
which O
nature O
has O
endowed O
them O
, O
in O
order O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
to O
soften O
to O
each O
other O
the O
privations O
to O
which O
their O
distance O
from O
the O
metropolis O
obliges O
them O
to O
submit O
? O
" O
In O
reply O
to O
this O
demand O
, O
there O
was O
a O
perfect O
clamour O
of O
approbation O

" O
Well O

continued O
Lady B-PERSON

your O

I O
am O
certain O
of O
success O

This O
noble O
act O
of O
Sir O
Matthew's S-PERSON

not O
pass O
away O

I O
ask O
not O

hackneyed O
worn O

out O

I O
will O
relate O
to O
him O

Sir O

interesting O
anecdote O

What O
say O
you O
to O
this O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
? O
" O
Upon O
my O
word O
, O
my O
lady O
, O
I O
think O
it O
is O
one O
of O
the O
cleverest O
and O
most O
agreeable O
ideas O
that O
ever O
entered O

lady's O
head O

If O
you O
and O
Mr. O
Norval S-PERSON
will O
arrange O
the O
drama O
, O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa E-PERSON
, O
I O
will O
take O
care O
to O
have O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
rooms O
fitted O
up O
as O
a O
theatre O

and O
depend O
upon O
it O
we O
shall O
be O
in O
no O
want O
of O
actors O

Upon O
my O
word O
I O
never O
liked O
any O
idea O
so O
much O
in O
my O
life O

" O
" O
Will O
it O
not O
be O
pleasant O

Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton E-PERSON

" O
said O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa E-PERSON

in O
her O
most O
caressing O
tone O
, O
to O
the O
heiress O

" O
Very O
pleasant O
, O
indeed O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
young O
lady O

" O
I O
should O
ask O
no O
better O
fun O

" O
" O
And O
what O
does O
my O
Lady B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
say O
? O
" O
resumed O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa E-PERSON
, O
with O
that O
stiffness O
of O
manner O
with O
which O
her O
ladyship O
now O
and O
then O
refreshed O
the O
memory O
of O
her O
plebeian O
friends O
, O
as O
to O
the O
difference O
of O
rank O
between O
them O

" O
" O
Oh O
! O
dear O
me O
, O
I O
am O
sure O
I O
don't O

replied O
Lady B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
, O
looking O
frightened O
. O
" O
Well O
! O
we O
must O
not O
torment O
Lady B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
by O
forcing O
her O
to O
act O

Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON

There O
cannot O
be O
a O

You O
will O

Mary B-PERSON

will O
you O
not O

" O
seldom O
refuse O

abet O
a O
scheme O
so O
exceedingly O
full O

this O

" O
We O
will O
set O
such O
an O
example O

cried O
Dr. O
Crockley S-PERSON
, O
rubbing O
his O
hands O
joyously O
, O
" O
that O
every O
county O

hear O

I O
know O
what O
Sir O

can O
make O
of O
a O

At O
this O
interesting O
moment O
, O
just O
as O
the O
fair O

Miss O

the O
great O

sent O
forth O
another O

upon O

Lady O

up O

all O

The O
person O
who O
produced O
this O
very O
powerful O
effect O
was O
a O
lady O
not O
particularly O
distinguished O
either O
by O
wealth O
or O
station O
| | O
but O
she O
seemed O
to O
possess O
the O
faculty O
of O
finding O
her O
way O
into O
every O
house O
within O
her O
reach O
, O
whether O
the O
owner O
of O
it O
desired O
her O
presence O
or O
not O
. O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
was O
the O
widow O
of O
a O
clergyman O
, O
who O
had O
formerly O
been O
vicar O
of O
the O
parish O
of O
St. B-GPE
Mary's E-GPE
, O
Ashleigh S-PERSON
, O
and O
having O
made O
herself O
the O
very O
largest O
acquaintance O
that O
ever O
was O
enjoyed O
by O
any O
country O
lady O
without O
a O
carriage O
, O
she O
determined O
upon O
continuing O
amongst O
them O
after O
her O
husband O
died O
, O
as O
it O
might O
have O
taken O
her O
, O
she O
said O
, O
more B-DATE
years E-DATE
than O
she O
was O
likely O
to O
live O
, O
before O
she O
could O
expect O
to O
make O
so O
many O
friends O
all O
over O
again O
. O
She O
therefore O
, O
on O
leaving O
the O
vicarage O
, O
contented O
herself O
with O
a O
very O
small O
house O
, O
as O
near O
the O
town O
as O
possible O
, O
and O
went O
on O
very O
much O
as O
she O
had O
done O
before O
, O
only O
having O
one S-CARDINAL
maid O
- O
servant O
instead O
of O
two S-CARDINAL
, O
and O
contenting O
herself O
with O
a O
donkey O
- O
chair O
and O
a O
very O
little O
boy O
to O
drive O
it O
, O
instead O
of O
a O
one S-CARDINAL
- O
horse O
chaise O
, O
and O
a O
steady O
man-servant O
of O
all O
work O

of O
St. B-GPE
Mary's E-GPE
, O
Ashleigh S-GPE
, O
was O
far O
enough O
from O
being O
richly O
endowed O
, O
and O
the O
private O
fortune O
of O
the O
late O
incumbent O
not O
such O
as O
to O
enable O
him O
to O
approach O
to O
any O
thing O
like O
an O
equality O
in O
his O
style O
of O
living O
to O
even O
the O
least O
wealthy O
among O
the O
manufacturers O
in O
the O
district O
, O
there O
is O
still O
a O
species O
of O
respect O
for O
the O
profession O
of O
a O
clergyman O
, O
which O
opens O
to O
him O
and O
his O
family O
the O
houses O
of O
many O
, O
greatly O
their O
superiors O
in O
point O
of O
wealth O

and O
it O
therefore O
pretty O
generally O
depends O
on O
the O
clergy O
themselves O
, O
whether O
they O
are O
on O
intimate O
terms O
with O
their O
neighbours O

not O

more O
properly O

Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON

who O
in O
strength O
of O
will O
had O
ever O
been O
his O
far O
better O
half O

did O
greatly O
desire O

intimate O

very O
intimate O

One S-CARDINAL
word O
more O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
shall O
be O
left O
to O
speak O
for O
herself O
, O
which O
she O
was O
certainly O
able O
to O
do O
, O
with O
as O
little O
impediment O
of O
any O
kind O
, O
as O
most O
people O
. O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
was O
the O
daughter O
of O
a O
physician O
| | O
and O
from O
her O
earliest O
years O
had O
acquired O
so O
decided O
a O
taste O
for O
the O
theory O
and O
practice O
of O
medicine O
, O
that O
she O
could O
never O
wean O
herself O
entirely O
from O
it O
, O
but O
was O
thought O
by O
many O
to O
let O
it O
still O
occupy O
rather O
too O
large O
a O
share O
of O
her O
conversation O
and O
thoughts O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
was O
exceedingly O
popular O
, O
for O
though O
her O
discourse O
ran O
much O
upon O
bruises O
and O
bowels O
, O
rickets O
and O
rheums O
, O
spasms O
and O
spines O
, O
it O
ran O
also O
upon O
matters O
more O
attractive O
. O
If O
she O
could O
not O
tell O
what O
every O
body O
for O
three B-QUANTITY
miles E-QUANTITY
round O
had O
for O
dinner O
on O
the O
very O
day O
on O
which O
she O
was O
speaking O
, O
it O
was O
a O
hundred S-CARDINAL
to O
one O
but O
she O
could O
tell O
, O
within O
a O
cutlet O
or O
a O
hash O
, O
what O
they O
had O
been O
all O
eating O
for O
a B-DATE
week I-DATE
before E-DATE
. O
She O
knew O
, O
with O
an O
approach O
to O
correctness O
that O
was O
perfectly O
astonishing O
, O
the O
amount O
of O
every O
body's O
expenditure O
, O

could O
tell O
to O
the O
fraction O
of O
a O
new O
ribbon O
, O
how O
many O
bonnets O
each O

the O
quantity O
of O

got O
through O
in O
every O

. O
No O
flirtation O
ever O
escaped O
either O
her O
eyes O
or O
her O
tongue O
, O
and O
the B-ORG
Morning I-ORG
Post E-ORG
was O
a O
less O
faithful O
record O
of O
fine O
parties O
, O
than O
the O
tablets O
of O
her O
comprehensive O
memory O
. O
The O
Dowling S-PERSON
family O
was O
aware O
of O
all O
this O
| | O
and O
each O
in O
their O
way O
had O
a O
peculiar O
value O
for O
her O
society O
, O
for O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
knew O
how O
to O
be O
all O
things O
to O
all O
men O
, O
women O
, O
and O
children O
| | O
but O
, O
at O
the O
present O
moment O
, O
it O
was O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
who O
felt O
the O
most O
decided O
movement O
of O
satisfaction O
at O
beholding O
her O
sharp O
black O
eyes O
, O
brisk O
step O
, O
and O
eager O
manner O
of O
reconnoitring O
every O
individual O
present O
, O
as O
she O
entered O
the O
room O
. O
" O
Here O
is O
my O
general O
advertiser O
, O
" O
thought O
the O
knight O
, O
as O
he O
extended O
his O
huge O
hand O
to O
welcome O
her O
. O
" O
We O
will O
have O
a O
theatrical O
representation O
that O
shall O
immortalize O
my O
charity O
, O
and O
here's O
the O
one O
that O
shall O
act O
the O
part O
of O
Fame O
, O
and O
trumpet O
it O
round O
the O
country O
. O
" O
that O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
continued O
his O
cordial O
hand O
- O
shaking O
. O
" O
Now O
you O
must O
just O
tell O
me O
what O
you O
are O
all O
about O
, O
for O
if O
you O
don't O
I O
shall O
die O
, O
and O
there's O
the O
truth O
. O
" O
" O
No O
, O
no O
, O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
, O
you O
shan't O
die O
, O
if O
we O
can O
save O
your O
life O
, O
" O
replied O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
in O
his O
most O
jovial O
tone O
. O
" O
We O
are O
a O
gay O
and O
happy O
party O
, O
at O
this O
moment O
, O
I O
do O
believe O
, O
one O
and O
all O
, O
" O
and O
here O
the O
knight O
thought O
proper O
to O
send O
a O
glance O
after O
little O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
who O
, O
notwithstanding O
his O
fine O
clothes O
, O
was O
looking O
pale O
and O
sad O
enough O
, O
in O
the O
most O
distant O
corner O
from O
the O
principal O
group O
to O
which O
he O
had O
been O
able O
to O
creep O
. O
The O
experienced O
eye O
of O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
read O
past O
suffering O
and O
present O
terror O
in O
his O
speaking O
features O
, O
and O
he O
cursed O
the O
trembling O
child O
in O
his O
heart O
of O
hearts O
. O
But O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
might O
have O
removed O
as O
many O
coatings O
as O
the O
grave O
- O
digger O
in O
Hamlet S-GPE
, O
ere O
the O
looker O
- O
on O
could O
have O
penetrated O
so O
far O
| | O
and O
it O
must O
have O
been O
a O
quick O
observer O
that O
could O
have O
detected O
the O
sort O
of O
lurid O
glare O
that O
for O
half O
an O
instant O
gleamed O
in O
the O
savage O
look O
he O
cast O
upon O
the O
boy O
. O
It O
was O
for O
no O
longer O
space O
that O
his O
joyous O
gaiety O
was O
obscured O
, O
and O
he O
then O
turned O
again O
his O
admiring O
glances O
upon O
the B-PERSON
Lady I-PERSON
Clarissa E-PERSON
, O
and O
resumed O
his O
speech O
. O
" O
This O
is O
the O
person O
, O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
, O
who O
must O
let O
you O
into O
the O
mystery O
. O
You O
must O
entreat O
her O
ladyship O
to O
be O
pleased O
to O
inform O
you O
what O
it O
is O
she O
is O
going O
to O
make O
us O
all O
do O
. O
" O
" O
Well O
then O
, O
I O
hope O
her O
ladyship O
won't O
refuse O
. O
You O
won't O
be O
so O
cruel O
, O
will O
you O
, O
my O
lady O
? O
" O
" O
No O
, O
certainly O
! O
" O
replied O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa E-PERSON
smiling O
complacently O
on O
the O
knight O
. O
" O
If O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
complies O
with O
my O
proposal O
, O
I O
shall O
have O
no O
objection O
to O
its O
being O
proclaimed O
to O
all O
the O
world O
. O
" O
And O
here O
glances O
were O
exchanged O
between O
the O
knight O
and O
the O
lady O
, O
perfectly O
intelligible O
to O
each O
other O
, O
and O
which O
said O
very O
distinctly O
, O
" O
Ah O
! O
Lady O
Clarissa S-PERSON
! O
" O
on O
the O
one S-CARDINAL
part O

and O
, O
" O
Oh O
! O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
! O
on O
the O
other O
. O
" O
Speak O
then O
, O
my O
lady O
! O
" O
said O
the O
gallant O
manufacturer O
with O
a O
low O
bow O
| | O
" O
and O
whatever O
you O
shall O
say O
, O
shall O
be O
law O
. O
" O
" O
Now O
then O
, O
ladies O
and O
gentlemen O
! O
all O
of O
you O
give O
ear O

for O
not O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
alone O
, O
but O
every O
one O
present O
, O
should O
pay O
attention O
to O
what O
I O
am O
about O
to O
say O
. O
" O
And O
here O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa E-PERSON
turned O
her O
eyes O
round O
about O
her O
in O
search O
of O
the O
hero O
of O
the O
scene O
. O
" O
Where O
is O
the O
little O
boy O
? O
" O
said O
she O
, O
in O
a O
tone O
of O
great O
theatrical O
feeling O
. O
while O
, O
in O
truth O
, O
it O
forcibly O
impelled O
the O
little O
trembler O
forward O
. O
" O
Now O
then O
, O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa E-PERSON
, O
" O
look O
at O
this O
interesting O
little O
fellow O
! O
It O
is O
he O
who O
is O
the O
hero O
of O
our O
fête O
. O
" O
" O
Indeed O
! O
And O
pray O
what O
may O
the O
young O
gentleman's O
name O
be O
? O
" O
said O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
. O
" O
Is O
not O
that O
delicious O
? O
" O
cried O
Lady O
Clarissa S-PERSON
. O
" O
Oh O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
! O
how O
I O
envy O
you O
your O
feelings O
! O
Note O
that O
, O
dear O
Norval S-PERSON

The O
touch O
is O
exquisitely O
dramatic O

must O
on O
no O

omitted O

This O
young O
gentleman O
, O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON

continued O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa E-PERSON
, O
with O
increasing O
animation O
, O
" O
this O
young O
gentleman O
as O
you O
most O
naturally O
call O
him O
, O
was O
a O
few O
short O
hours O
ago O
, O
a O
wretched O
, O
ragged O
beggar O
- O
boy O
! O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
, O
from O
motives O
, O
that O
I O
dare O
not O
wound O
his O
generous O
heart O
by O
thus O
publicly O
dwelling O
upon O

has O
rescued O
him O
from O
poverty O

destruction O

This O
deed O
, O
so O
beautiful O
in O
itself O
, O
and O
so O
beneficial O
in O
its O
influence O
as O
an O
example O

is O
about O
to O
be O
immortalized O
as O
it O
ought O
to O
be O
, O
by O
the O
pen O

the O
rapid O

brilliant O
, O
touching O
pen O
of O
my O
young O
friend O
, O
Mr. O
Osmond B-PERSON
Norval E-PERSON
. O
He O
has O
undertaken O
to O
dramatize O
this O
charming O
trait O
of O
benevolence O
, O
and O
our O
excellent O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
has O
consented O
to O
fit O
up O
a O
little O
theatre O
for O
the O
representation O
of O
it O
, O
at O
which O
all O
the O

If O

exclaimed O
Mrs. O

clapping O
her O
hands O
in O
ecstasy O

" O
Not O

Mrs. O

the O
knight O

with O
his O
most O
friendly O

the O
delighted O
Mrs. O

making O
her O
way O
towards O
the O
sofa O

Good O
morning O

my O
Lady O

away O
bustled O
Sir O
Matthew's S-PERSON
public O
advertiser O
to O
spread O
the O
glorious O
news O
of O
private O
theatricals O
at O
Dowling B-FAC
Lodge E-FAC
, O
throughout O
the O
country O

She O
paused O
for O
one O
moment O
, O
however O
, O
as O
she O
passed O
by O
Michael S-PERSON

and O
putting O
her O
hand O
upon O
his O
head O

so O
as O
to O
make O
him O
turn O
his O
face O
up O
towards O
her O

she O
said O
, O
after O
looking O
at O
him O
very O
earnestly O
, O
" O
Well O
now O
, O
for O
a O
beggar O

child O

sure O
the O
genteelest O

looking O
little O
fellow O
, O
I O
ever O
did O
see O

but O
, O
perhaps O
that O
may O
be O
owing O
to O
his O
being O
so O
pale O
and O
thin O
, O
which O
is O
certainly O
a O
great O
deal O
more O
elegant O
than O
fatness O

red O
cheeks O

it O

seem O

in O
perfect O
health O

I O
do O
assure O
you O

Mrs. O

as O
you O
would O
have O
said O

the O
amiable O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON

him O
under O
the O
chin O

" O
But O
, O
by O
the O
way O
, O
" O
continued O
the O
merry O
knight O
, O
" O
I O
rather O
suspect O
that O
I O
called O
him O
away O
before O
he O
had O
quite O
finished O

that's O
what O
it O
is O

him O

never O

go O
back O
again O

there's O
a O

Michael S-PERSON

fellow O

how O
he O
blushes O
! O
" O
And O
here O
the O
benevolent O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
himself O
opened O
the O
door O
leading O
to O
the O
dining O

room O

playfully O
pushed O
the O
" O

through O
it O

" O
Well O
now O

again O

astonished O
Mrs. O

without O

the O

to O
the O
top O
of O
her O
bent O
" O
with O
wonderful O
intelligence O
, O
that O
she O
actually O
suffered O
from O
the O
repletion O
till O
half B-CARDINAL
a I-CARDINAL
dozen E-CARDINAL
gossippings O
had O
relieved O
it O

Meanwhile O
, O
the O
party O
she O
left O
resolved O
themselves O
into O
a O
committee O
of O
management O
upon O
the O
business O
in O
hand O
. O
Mr. O
Osmond B-PERSON
Norval E-PERSON
was O
entreated O
to O
urge O
his O
eloquent O
pen O
with O
the O
greatest O
possible O
rapidity O
| | O
while O
on O
his O
part O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
promised O
that O
the O
necessary O
workmen O
should O
immediately O
be O
employed O
in O
preparing O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
largest O
rooms O
in O
the O
house O
as O
a O
theatre O
. O
When O
the O
consultation O
reached O
this O
point O
, O
Lady B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
suddenly O
rose O
and O
left O
the O
room O
| | O
but O
this O
circumstance O
did O
not O
appear O
to O
produce O
much O
emotion O
in O
any O
of O
the O
party O
, O
and O
they O
remained O
together O
in O
a O
most O
delightful O
state O
of O
hubbub O
and O
excitement O
till O
the O
heiress O
grew O
tired O
, O
and O
ventured O
to O
hint O
that O
she O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
best O
for O
her O
to O
drive O
home O
first S-ORDINAL
, O
and O
then O
send O
her O
carriage O
back O
for O
the O
accommodation O
of O
her O
noble O
friend O
. O
This O
proposal O
brought O
the O
meeting O
to O
a O
conclusion O

but O
not O
till O
Lady O
Clarissa S-PERSON
had O
confessed O
in O
a O
whisper O
to O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
that O
she O
never O
in O
her O
whole O
life O
remembered O
to O
have O
taken O
any O
thing O
that O
did O
her O
so O
much O
good O
, O
as O
the O
delicious O
grapes O
he O
had O
sent O
home O
with O
her O
the O
evening O
before O

morning S-TIME
drawing O

, O
the O
forgotten O
Martha S-PERSON
— O
forgotten O
at O
least O
by O
all O
but O
little O
Michael S-PERSON
— O
employed O
herself O
in O
seeking O
such O
a O
basket O
, O
as O
might O
answer O
the O
purpose O
of O
a O
viaticum O
between O
the O
object O
of O
her O
father's O
charity O
, O
and O
the O
mother O
and O
brother O
of O
whom O
he O
had O
so O
fondly O
spoken O
. O
Having O
at O
length O
succeeded O
in O
her O
quest O
, O
she O
returned O
to O
the O
dining O
- O
room O
, O
and O
was O
almost O
as O
much O
disappointed O
at O
finding O
the O
object O
of O
her O
good O
- O
natured O
exertions O
flown O
, O
as O
the O
poor O
child O
himself O
had O
been O
, O
when O
obliged O
to O
quite O
the O
room O
to O
which O
this O
kind O
friend O
had O
promised O
to O
return O
. O
But O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
though O
not O
a O
person O
very O
highly O
favoured O
by O
circumstances O
, O
was O
nevertheless O
better O
off O
than O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
inasmuch O
as O
by O
keeping O
out O
of O
sight O
she O
could O
pretty O
generally O
contrive O
to O
remain O
where O
she O
chose O
, O
and O
do O
what O
she O
liked O
. O
These O
enviable O
privileges O
enabled O
her O
now O
to O
sit O
down O
at O
one O
of O
the O
large O
open O
windows O
of O
the O
diningroom O
, O
and O
to O
draw O
from O
her O
unseemly O
- O
sized O
pocket O
, O
a O
volume O
of O
Shakspeare S-PERSON
, O
with O
which O
she O
determined O
to O
beguile O
the O
time O
till O
the O
boy O
should O
return O
, O
or O
till O
by O
some O
means O
or O
other O
, O
she O
might O
be O
able O
to O
discover O
what O
had O
become O
of O
him O
. O
When O
therefore O
, O
impelled O
by O
the O
playful O
, O
but O
very O
effectual O
impulse O
of O
Sir O
Matthew's S-PERSON
shove O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
once O
more O
entered O
the O
dining O
- O
parlour O
, O
he O
had O
the O
satisfaction O
of O
being O
again O
greeted O
by O
the O
friendly O
eye O
and O
friendly O
voice O
, O
which O
had O
already O
so O
greatly O
cheered O
him O
. O
" O
So O
, O
here O
you O
are O
again O
, O
my O
little O
man O
, O
" O
said O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
repocketing O
her O
book O
, O
and O
rising O
| | O
" O
I O
thought O
you O
would O
hardly O
forget O
the O
basket O
: O
see O
, O
here O
it O
is O
, O
and O
now O
you O
shall O
help O
me O
pack O
it O
. O
" O
The O
help O
thus O
asked O
for O
, O
was O
afforded O
by O
the O
happy O
child's O
holding O
the O
basket O
in O
his O
hand O
, O
as O
he O
followed O
her O
round O
the O
table O
, O
while O
with O
a O
smile O
that O
spoke O
as O
much O
pleasure O
as O
his O
own O
, O
she O
selected O
all O
sorts O
of O
good O
things O
to O
put O
into O
it O
. O
" O
There O
! O
now O
I O
don't O
think O
we O
can O
put O
in O
any O
more O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
| | O
so O
set O
off O
, O
and O
carry O
it O
to O
your O
mother O
. O
" O
With O
eyes O
beaming O
rapture O
, O
and O
little O
hands O
that O
trembled O
with O
delight O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
closed O
the O
lid O
of O
the O
basket O
, O
and O
proceeded O
towards O
the O
door O
| | O
but O
ere O
he O
had O
fully O
reached O
it O
, O
he O
stopped O
short O
, O
and O
addressing O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
tone O
as O
fearless O
and O
confidential O
as O
if O
she O
had O
been O
his O
sister O
, O
he O
said O
, O
" O
But O
what O
d'ye O
think O
about O
Teddy S-PERSON
? O
Mightn't O
I O
change O
into O
my O
old O
clothes O
again O
, O
and O
just O
step O
into O
the O
factory O
for O
one B-TIME
minute E-TIME
? O
Teddy S-PERSON
can't O
almost O
never O
eat O
the O
dinner O
as O
we O
takes O
to O
the O
factory O
, O
and O
a O
bit O
of O
this O
would O
do O
him O
so O
much O
good O
! O
— O
May O
I O
? O
" O
" O
Upon O
my O
word O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
I O
am O
rather O
puzzled O
what O
to O
say O
, O
" O
replied O
his O
friend O
| | O
" O
as O
papa O
has O
ordered O
you O
to O
have O
these O
clothes O
, O
he O
might O
not O
be O
pleased O
at O
your O
taking O
them O
off O
again O
, O
and O
it O
would O
be O
a O
great O
pity O
to O
make O
him O
angry O
with O
you O
when O
he O
is O
so O
very O
good O
and O
kind O
, O
wouldn't O
it O
? O
" O
Michael S-PERSON
hung O
his O
head O
, O
and O
said O
nothing O
. O
" O
But O
why O
need O
you O
change O
your O
clothes O
, O
my O
dear O
boy O
? O
— O
I O
dare O
say O
Teddy S-PERSON
would O
be O
very O
proud O
to O
see O
you O
look O
so O
nice O
. O
" O
Still O
Michael S-PERSON
answered O
not O
, O
but O
began O
assiduously O
picking O
to O
pieces O
the O
handle O
of O
Martha's O
delicate O
basket O
. O
" O
Don't S-PERSON
do O
that O
, O
dear O
, O
" O
said O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
approaching O
, O
and O
taking O
the O
offending O
hand O
in O
hers O
| | O
" O
but O
tell O
me O
what O
you O
are O
thinking O
about O
? O
" O
" O
I O
am O
thinking O
, O
" O
said O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
" O
that O
if O
I O
walked O
into O
the O
midst O
of O
' O
em O
this O
way O
, O
and O
up O
to O
poor O
Teddy S-PERSON
, O
in O
his O
dirty O
ragged O
clothes O
, O
it O
would O
look O
" O
— O
and O
here O
he O
stopped O
without O
finishing O
the O
sentence O
. O
" O
It O
would O
look O
, O
how O
? O
— O
as O
if O
you O
were O
proud O
, O
perhaps O
? O
" O
said O
Martha S-PERSON
. O
The O
child O
shook O
his O
head O
. O
" O
No O
, O
not O
that O
. O
Teddy S-PERSON
would O
not O
think O
that O
, O
" O
he O
replied O
. O
" O
What O
would O
he O
think O
, O
then O
? O
— O
Tell O
me O
all O
that O
is O
passing O
in O
your O
little O
head O
, O
and O
then O
I O
shall O
be O
able O
to O
advise O
you O
. O
" O
" O
Why O
, O
he'd O
think O
, O
" O
said O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
and O
tears O
started O
as O
he O
spoke O
— O
" O
he'd O
think O
that O
he O
and O
I O
could O
never O
be O
right O
down O
brothers O
any O
more O
. O
" O
Martha S-PERSON
involuntarily O
kissed O
the O
little O
face O
that O
was O
turned O
up O
to O
hers O
, O
but O
replied O
, O
laughingly O
, O
" O
Oh O
! O
that's O
foolish O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
| | O
do O
you O
think O
that O
a O
fine O
jacket O
could O
separate O
two S-CARDINAL
little O
brothers O
that O
love O
each O
other O
? O
— O
I O
think O
I O
could O
love O
you O
quite O
as O
well O
in O
a O
shabby O
coat O
, O
as O
in O
a O
fine O
one O
. O
" O
Michael S-PERSON
looked O
at O
her O
very O
earnestly O
for O
a B-TIME
minute E-TIME
or O
two S-CARDINAL
, O
and O
then O
said O
, O
almost O
in O
a O
whisper O
, O
" O
Is O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
, O
as O
owns O
our O
factory O
, O
your O
father O
? O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
" O
replied O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
colouring O
from O
some O
painful O
feeling O
which O
the O
expression O
of O
the O
boy's O
speaking O
features O
had O
given O
rise O
to O
. O
The O
child O
coloured O
too O
, O
but O
said O
, O
with O
good O
courage O
, O
" O
Please O
, O
ma'am O
, O
I O
should O
love O
Teddy S-PERSON

well O

Teddy S-PERSON
would O
love O
me O

mock O
at O
him O

me O
too O

and O
I O
know O
Teddy S-PERSON
could O
not O
bear O
it O

" O
" O
Then O
they O
would O
not O
be O

good O
children O

think O
you O
are O

tell O
me O
, O
Michael S-PERSON

something O
about O
the O
mill O

papa O
has O
never O
let O
us O
see O
it O
yet O

I O
believe O

dirty O
place O

Is O
it O
very O
dirty O

could O
do O
to O
hear O
it O
| | O
and O
so O
melancholy O
a O
look O
accompanied O
the O
words O
, O
that O
she O
could O
not O
help O
thinking O
there O
was O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
truth O
in O
what O
she O
had O
constantly O
heard O
repeated O
by O
most O
of O
her O
father's O
friends O
and O
neighbours O
, O
as O
well O
as O
himself O
— O
namely O
, O
that O
the O
factory O
children O
were O
a O
race O
of O
very O
idle O
, O
ungrateful O
little O
creatures O
| | O
spoilt O
by O
the O
high O
wages O
and O
indulgence O
they O
received O
, O
and O
quite O
unconscious O
of O
the O
inestimable O
advantages O
they O
possessed O
over O
all O
the O
other O
children O
in O
the O
British S-NORP
dominions O
. O
But O
, O
nevertheless O
, O
though O
this O
disagreeable O
conviction O
pressed O
very O
painfully O
upon O
her O
, O
Martha S-PERSON
could O
not O
help O
feeling O
very O
kindly O
disposed O
towards O
little O
Michael S-PERSON
| | O
and O
upon O
his O
presently O
saying O
, O
" O
Shall O
I O
go O
to O
mother O
and O
Teddy S-PERSON
, O
if O
you O
please O
, O
ma'am O
? O
" O
she O
almost O
forgot O
all O
the O
naughtiness O
she O
attributed O
to O
him O
and O
his O
fraternity O
, O
and O
only O
remembering O
the O
disadvantage O
that O
any O
disobedience O
to O
her O
father's O
wishes O
might O
bring O
upon O
him O
, O
said O
, O
" O
Wait O
one O
moment O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
and O
I O
will O
find O
papa O
, O
and O
ask O
if O
you O
may O
change O
your O
dress O
, O
in O
order O
to O
visit O
your O
brother O
in O
the O
factory O
. O
" O
So O
saying O
, O
she O
left O
the O
room O
, O
and O
having O
ascertained O
that O
the O
visiters O
were O
gone O
, O
ventured O
to O
seek O
her O
father O
in O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
| | O
where O
she O
found O
him O
deep O
in O
consultation O
with O
Dr. O
Crockley S-PERSON
, O
his O
two S-CARDINAL
eldest O
daughters O
, O
and O
his O
son O
, O
as O
to O
the O
possibility O
of O
converting O
the O
school O
- O
room O
into O
a O
theatre O
: O
all O
being O
of O
opinion O
that O
the O
great O
drawing O
- O
room O
must O
be O
reserved O
for O
the O
ball O
, O
and O
the O
dining O
- O
room O
for O
the O
supper O
, O
which O
it O
was O
agreed O
on O
all O
sides O
must O
follow O
the O
representation O
. O
" O
May O
I O
speak O
to O
you O
, O
papa O
? O
" O
said O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
timidly O
, O
on O
perceiving O
that O
the O
whole O
party O
were O
exceedingly O
earnest O
upon O
some O
theme O
or O
other O
. O
" O
Oh O
! O
goodness O
, O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
don't O
come O
to O
plague O
us O
now O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
Arabella S-PERSON
. O
" O
It O
is O
very O
odd O
, O
but O
Martha S-PERSON
always O
does O
come O
in O
the O
way O
of O
every O
thing O
, O
" O
said O
Harriet S-PERSON
. O
" O
I O
wish O
you O
were O
married O
or O
buried O
, O
child O
! O
" O
cried O
the O
lively O
Augustus S-PERSON
| | O
" O
for O
you O
make O
a O
monstrous O
bad O
had O
at O
playing O
the O
young O
lady O
of O
fashion O
. O
Upon O
my O
life O
you O
grow O
fatter O
every O
day O
. O
Doesn't O
she O
, O
doctor O
? O
I O
wish O
you O
would O
dose O
her O
a O
little O
. O
" O
" O
That O
Miss O
Martha S-PERSON
is O
a O
little O
opaque O
, O
I O
will O
not O
deny O
, O
" O
replied O
Dr. O
Crockley S-PERSON
, O
familiarly O
coming O
behind O
her O
, O
and O
measuring O
the O
expanse O
of O
her O
waist O
with O
his O
two S-CARDINAL
hands O
. O
" O
May O
I O
speak O
to O
you O
, O
papa O
? O
" O
repeated O
the O
patient O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
quietly O
retreating O
from O
the O
jocose O
hands O
of O
Dr. O
Crockley S-PERSON
, O
but O
apparently O
quite O
insensible O
to O
all O
the O
other O
attacks O
. O
" O
What O
do O
you O
want O
to O
say O
, O
Martha S-PERSON
? O
" O
demanded O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
. O
Thus O
much O
encouraged O
, O
she O
drew O
near O
and O
whispered O
to O
him O
, O
" O
The O
little O
boy O
that O
you O
have O
taken O
in O
, O
papa O
, O
wants O
to O
know O
if O
he O
may O
put O
on O
his O
old O
clothes O
again O
, O
and O
go O
to O
speak O
to O
his O
brother O
in O
the O
factory O
? O
" O
" O
Do O
you O
hear O
this O
, O
doctor O
? O
" O
exclaimed O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
| | O
" O
the O
boy O
wants O
to O
go O
back O
to O
the O
factory O
again O
. O
Isn't O
that O
an O
answer O
to O
all O
the O
trash O
that O
people O
have O
been O
trying O
to O
get O
up O
about O
their O
being O
over O
- O
worked O
? O
It O
is O
just O
like O
' O
em O
— O
that's O
the O
very O
model O
of O
a O
factory O
child O
— O
do O
what O
you O
will O
, O
you O
can O
never O
content O
' O
em O
. O
" O
" O
The O
chap O
want's O
to O
get O
back O
to O
the O
factory O
? O
" O
said O
Dr. O
Crockley S-PERSON
, O
addressing O
himself O
to O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
with O
an O
accent O
that O
indicated O
surprise O
. O
" O
That's O
curious O
enough O
, O
any O
how O
. O
" O
" O
No O
, O
sir O
, O
I O
do O
not O
believe O
he O
wants O
to O
do O
any O
more O
than O
speak O
to O
his O
brother O
, O
who O
is O
at O
work O
there O
— O
he O
wanted O
to O
take O
him O
something O
that O
was O
left O
at O
luncheon O
, O
papa O
. O
" O
" O
And O
to O
show O
off O
his O
own O
good O
living O
to O
the O
factory O
? O
That's O
it O
, O
I O
suspect O
, O
doctor O
| | O
one O
can O
understand O
that O
— O
and O
what O
do O
you O
say O
to O
it O
? O
I O
should O
have O
no O
objection O
, O
I O
think O
| | O
what's O
your O
opinion O
? O
only O
I O
don't O
see O
the O
fun O
of O
his O
going O
in O
his O
old O
rags O
, O
if O
he O
went O
as O
you O
saw O
him O
just O
now O
, O
it O
would O
make O
some O
fun O
, O
wouldn't O
it O
? O
" O
" O
Capital O
, O
by O
Jove S-PERSON
! O
" O
replied O
the O
doctor O
. O
" O
How O
quick O
you O
are O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
! O
you O
seize O
every O
thing O
in O
a O
moment O
. O
What O
do O
you O
say O
to O
our O
going O
along O
with O
him O
? O
Mightn't O
we O
catch O
a O
hint O
or O
two S-CARDINAL
, O
as O
to O
how O
things O
were O
going O
on O
? O
" O
" O
If O
I'm O
quick O
, O
Crockley S-PERSON
, O
upon O
my O
soul O
you O
are O
not O
slow O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
knight O
. O
" O
You've O
got O
your O
horse O
here O
, O
of O
course O
? O
" O
The O
doctor O
nodded O
assent O
. O
" O
Then O
I O
will O
order O
mine O
, O
and O
we'll O
ride O
down O
to O
the O
mill O
together O
. O
So O
get O
along O
, O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
and O
tell O
the O
boy O
that O
I O
will O
take O
him O
to O
the O
factory O
with O
me O
, O
but O
that O
he O
is O
not O
to O
change O
his O
clothes O
. O
" O
Martha S-PERSON
felt O
quite O
aware O
that O
she O
had O
not O
executed O
her O
commission O
successfully O
. O
But O
there O
was O
no O
help O
for O
it O
, O
and O
therefore O
with O
the O
best O
grace O
she O
could O
, O
she O
told O
her O
little O
client O
the O
result O
of O
it O
. O
The O
whole O
aspect O
of O
the O
boy O
changed O
as O
he O
heard O
it O
, O
and O
, O
as O
if O
instinctively O
, O
he O
placed O
the O
precious O
basket O
, O
that O
till O
now O
he O
had O
continued O
to O
hold O
firmly O
in O
his O
hand O
, O
upon O
a O
table O
near O
him O
. O
" O
But O
take O
your O
basket O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
the O
kind O
- O
hearted O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
voice O
that O
was O
intended O
to O
cheer O
him O
| | O
" O
I O
am O
sure O
papa O
won't O
be O
angry O
at O
your O
doing O
that O
, O
for O
I O
told O
him O
about O
it O
. O
" O
" O
No O
, O
please O
ma'am O
, O
I'd O
rather O
not O
, O
" O
said O
Michael S-PERSON
. O
" O
Well O
, O
then O
, O
go O
into O
the O
hall O
, O
by O
that O
door O
, O
and O
wait O
till O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
comes O
through O
. O
Perhaps O
he O
will O
speak O
to O
you O
about O
it O
, O
and O
at O
any O
rate O
you O
had O
better O
carry O
it O
as O
far O
as O
that O
. O
" O
The O
child O
obeyed O
her O
, O
and O
taking O
up O
again O
the O
treasure O
he O
no O
longer O
valued O
, O
passed O
out O
into O
the O
hall O
| | O
but O
before O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
and O
his O
friend O
entered O
it O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
had O
put O
the O
worthless O
basket O
out O
of O
sight O
. O
Hardly O
had O
he O
done O
so O
, O
when O
he O
heard O
the O
coarse O
laugh O
of O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
and O
the O
respondent O
titter O
of O
the O
doctor O
approaching O
. O
The O
little O
fellow O
started O
, O
and O
jumped O
aside O
, O
in O
order O
to O
place O
himself O
out O
of O
their O
way O

but O
the O
knight O
, O
striding O
to O
the O
place O
where O
he O
stood O
, O
seized O
him O
by O
the O
shoulder O
with O
his O
hand O
, O
while O
with O
a O
vigorous O
action O
of O
his O
enormous O
foot O
, O
he O
sent O
him O
forward O
towards O
the O
house O
- O
door O
. O
This O
feat O
, O
which O
was O
performed O
with O
considerable O
dexterity O
, O
met O
its O
reward O
, O
in O
the O
shout O
of O
laughter O
with O
which O
Dr. O
Crockley S-PERSON
welcomed O
it O
. O
" O
By O
Jove S-PERSON
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
! O
" O
he O
exclaimed O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
had O
recovered O
his O
breath O

" O
there O
is O
nothing O
like O
you O
on O
the O
face O
of O
God's O
earth O

— O
It O
is O
a O
confounded O
monopoly O

, O
let O
me O
tell O
you O

No O
man O
has O
a O
right O
to O
be O
the O
deepest O
reasoner O

the O
best O
jester O
, O
and O
the O
most O
finished O
man O
of O
taste O
of O
his O
age O
. O
It's O
monstrous O
, O
Sir O
knight O
, O
and O
a O
conspiracy O
against O
you O
would O
be O
a O
very O
honest O
plot O

" O
And O
as O
he O
spoke O
he O
held O
his O
sides O
, O
as O
if O
still O
suffering O
from O
the O
effects O
of O
his O
excessive O
merriment O
. O
A O
servant O
who O
followed O
the O
facetious O
pair O
now O
opened O
the O
door O
, O
and O
on O
the O
broad O
esplanade O
of O
gravel O
before O
it O
a O
couple O
of O
grooms O
were O
holding O
the O
gentlemen's O
horses O
. O
As O
soon O
as O
they O
were O
seated O
in O
their O
saddles O
, O
with O
a O
mounted O
attendant O
behind O
them O
, O
the O
great O
manufacturer O
turned O
round O
his O
head O
to O
seek O
the O
object O
of O
his O
charity O
. O
Michael S-PERSON
stood O
doubting O
and O
trembling O
on O
the O
lowest O
step O
of O
the O
portico O
, O
while O
a O
faint O
hope O
fluttered O
at O
his O
heart O
, O
that O
the O
grand O
gentlemen O
would O
ride O
away O
and O
forget O
him O

but O
it O
was O
quickly O
chased O
by O
the O
voice O
of O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
who O
, O
bringing O
his O
horse's O
head O
so O
close O
upon O
the O
child O
, O
as O
to O
touch O
him O
, O
while O
he O
seemed O
almost O
to O
shrink O
into O
the O
pillar O
by O
which O
he O
stood O
, O
to O
escape O
it O
, O
said O
in O
a O
voice O
, O
the O
jeering O
tone O
of O
which O
again O
almost O
convulsed O
Dr. O
Crockley S-PERSON
with O
laughter O
, O
" O

young O
gentleman O

may O
you O
happen O

know O
the O
way O

" O
The O
boy O
looked O
out O
upon O
the O
wide O

spreading O
park O

left O
unsecured O
for O
a O
single O
instant O
. O
The O
summons O
was O
answered O
by O
a O
lame O
boy O
, O
stationed O
within O
to O
perform O
the O
office O
of O
porter O
. O
He O
bent O
low O
before O
the O
great O
man O
, O
and O
low O
too O
before O
his O
jeering O
friend O
| | O
though O
the O
jocose O
visits O
of O
the O
latter O
to O
the O
factory O
were O
dreaded O
as O
much O
as O
the O
lash O
itself O
. O
Neither O
the O
one O
nor O
the O
other O
seemed O
to O
see O
him O
, O
but O
passed O
on O
. O
Then O
followed O
poor O
little O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
hating O
most O
cordially O
the O
bravery O
of O
the O
attire O
, O
which O
made O
him O
expect O
to O
meet O
the O
ridicule O
, O
rather O
than O
the O
sympathy O
, O
of O
his O
late O
companions O
. O
On O
seeing O
a O
young O
stranger O
, O
the O
lame O
porter O
looked O
up O
| | O
but O
from O
him O
, O
at O
least O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
had O
nothing O
to O
fear O
| | O
for O
the O
boy's O
languid O
eye O
surveyed O
his O
altered O
person O
, O
without O
the O
slightest O
suspicion O
of O
ever O
having O
seen O
it O
before O
. O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
like O
most O
others O
of O
his O
craft O
, O
was O
not O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
indulging O
his O
family O
by O
exhibiting O
to O
them O
the O
secret O
arcana O
of O
that O
hideous O
mystery O
by O
which O
the O
delicate O
forms O
of O
young O
children O
are O
made O
to O
mix O
and O
mingle O
with O
the O
machinery O
, O
from O
whence O
flows O
the O
manufacturer's O
wealth O
. O
This O
divine O
portion O
of O
the O
vast O
engine O
being O
considered O
, O
however O
, O
as O
a O
very O
inferior O
, O
though O
necessary O
, O
part O
of O
it O
. O
But O
, O
although O
they O
had O
never O
honoured O
the O
premises O
with O
a O
visit O
, O
it O
was O
, O
of O
course O
, O
well O
known O
to O
all O
that O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
was O
the O
father O
of O
a O
numerous O
progeny O

Michael S-PERSON
passed O
on O
amidst O
such O
blessings O
as O
human O
nature O
, O
under O
such O
circumstances O
, O
was O
likely O
to O
bestow O
on O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
them O

mere O
unfettered O
use O
of O
them O
a O
delight O
, O
are O
banished O
for O
ever O

The O
ceaseless O
whirring O
of O
a B-CARDINAL
million E-CARDINAL
hissing O
wheels O
, O
seizes O
on O
the O
tortured O
ear O

and O
while O
threatening O
to O
destroy O
the O
delicate O
sense O
, O
seems O
bent O
on O
proving O
first S-ORDINAL
, O
with O
a O
sort O
of O
mocking O
mercy O
, O
of O
how O
much O
suffering O
it O
can O
be O
the O
cause O
. O
The O
scents O
that O
reek O
around O
, O
from O
oil O
, O
tainted O
water O
, O
and O
human O
filth O
, O
with O
that O
last O
worst O
nausea O
, O
arising O
from O
the O
hot O
refuse O
of O
atmospheric O
air O
, O
left O
by O
some B-CARDINAL
hundred E-CARDINAL
pairs O
of O
labouring O
lungs O

the O
act O
of O
breathing O
a O
process O
of O
difficulty O
, O
disgust O
, O
and O
pain O
. O
All O
this O
is O
terrible O
. O
But O
what O
the O
eye O
brings O
home O
to O
the O
heart O
of O
those O
, O
who O
look O
round O
upon O
the O
horrid O
earthly O
hell O

is O
enough O
to O
make O
it O
all O
forgotten O

for O
who O
can O
think O
of O
villanous O
smells O

or O
heed O
the O
suffering O
of O
the O
earracking O
sounds O
, O
while O
they O
look O
upon O
hundreds S-CARDINAL
of O
helpless O
children O
, O
divested O
of O
every O
trace O
of O
health O

, O
and O
even O
of O

Assuredly O
there O
is O
no O
exaggeration O
in O
this O

for O
except O
only O
in O
their O
diminutive O
size O

these O

no O

Lean O

distorted O
limbs O

sallow O

sunken O

But O
in O

entered O

the O
dirty O

redolent O

So O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
proudly O
looked O
about O
him O
, O
and O
approved O

and O
though O
it O
was O
athwart O
that O
species O
of O
haughty O
frown O
, O
in O
which O
such O
dignity O
as O
his O
is O
apt O
to O
clothe O
itself O
, O
Dr. O
Crockley S-PERSON
failed O
not O
to O
perceive O
, O
that O
his O
friend O

patron O
was O
in O
good O
humour O

likely O
to O
be O
pleased O
by O
any O
light O

lively O
jestings O
in O
which O
he O
might O
indulge O

Perceiving O
, O
therefore O
, O
that O
little O
Michael S-PERSON
passed O
on O
with O
downcast O
eyes O
, O
unrecognised O
by O
any O

wrote O
upon O
a O
slip O
of O
paper O

knew O
his O
voice O
could O
not O

us O

" O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
read O
the O
scroll O
, O

grinned O
applause O

The O
miserable O
creature O
to O
whom O
the O
facetious O
doctor O
pointed O
, O
was O
a O
little O

rudely O
torn O
from O
infant O

, O
in O
the O

It O
was O
a O
sort O
of O
vague O
hope O
that O
something O
comical O
of O
this O
kind O
might O
occur O
, O
which O
induced O
Dr. O
Crockley S-PERSON
to O
propose O
this O
frolic O
to O
his O
friend O
, O
and O
probably O
the O
same O
idea O
suggested O
itself O
to O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
likewise O
. O
" O
I O

vociferated O
the O

in O
a O

successfully O

" O
The O
stern O
and O
steady O
machinery O
moved O
onward O
, O
passing O
over O
the O
body O
of O
the O
little O
girl O
, O
who O
owed O
her O
safety O
to O
the O
miserable O
leanness O

shrunken O
frame O

Michael S-PERSON
moved O

Still O
Michael S-PERSON
did O
not O
stir O

neither O
did O
he O
speak O

or O
if O
he O
did O
, O
his O
young O
voice O
was O
wholly O
inaudible O
, O
and O
the O
anger O
of O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
was O
demonstrated O
by O
a O
clenched O
fist O
and O
threatening O
brow O
. O
" O
Where O
the O
devil O
is O
Parsons S-PERSON

" O
he O
demanded O
in O
accents O

poor O
Michael S-PERSON
both O
heard O

understood O

the O

his O

found O

" O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
perceived O
that O
his O

agent O
feared O
to O
enforce O
his O
first S-ORDINAL
brutal O
command O

was O
forced O

therefore O

to O
content O
himself O

he O

cast O
a O
glance O

" O
All O
that O
Michael S-PERSON
clearly O
understood O
from O
this O
harangue O
was O
, O
that O
he O
had O
permission O
to O
go O
forward O

speak O
to O
his O
brother O

and O
though O
not O
venturing O
quite O
to O
run O
, O
he O
moved O
onward O
at O
a O
pace O
that O
speedily O
brought O
him O
within O
sight O
of O
Edward S-PERSON

The O
little O
fellow O
who O
, O
despite O
his O
gay O
disguise O
, O
immediately O
recognised O
him O

uttered O
a O
cry O

joy O

" O
Love O
conquered O

and O
dropping O
the O
reel O
he O
had O
just O
taken O
between O
his O
fingers O
, O
he O
rushed O
from O
the O
place O
he O
occupied O
before O
the O
mules O
, O
and O
the O
next O
moment O
was O
fondly O
clasped O
in O
his O
brother's O
arms O

Every O
labourer O
in O

factory O
, O
within O
sight O
of O
the O
spot O
where O
this O
meeting O
took O
place O
, O
forgot O
all O
standing O

their O
astonishment O

stood O
with O
gaping O
mouths O

eyes O
fixed O
upon O
the O
astounding O
spectacle O

Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
too O
, O
forgot O
for O
an O
instant O
, O
that O
every O
movement O
made O
within O
that O
crowded O
chamber O
, O
not O
having O
for O
its O
object O
the O
transmutation O
of O
human O
life O
into O
gold O
, O
was O
a O
positive O
loss O
to O
him O

for O
the O
display O
of O
his O
extraordinary O
benevolence O
was O
, O
he O
conceived O
, O
of O
high O
importance O
, O
and O
he O
looked O
round O
with O
great O
contentment O
on O
the O
multitude O
of O
wondering O
faces O
which O
he O
saw O
peering O
over O
the O
machinery O
in O
all O
directions O

to O
gaze O
on O
the O

from O

turned O
his O

when O
, O
to O
his O
inconceivable O
astonishment O

still O
stood O
locked O
in O

weeping O
bitterly O

the O
feeling O
by O

laid O
a O

on O
the O
shoulder O

he O
said O
in O
a O

power O

Lady B-PERSON

her O
mother O

within O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
days E-DATE
of O
her O
death O

When O
, O
therefore O
, O
this O
long O
- O
expected O
event O
at O
length O
took O
place O
, O
they O
both O
thought O
themselves O
privileged O

assume O
the O
freedom O
of O
intimate O
friends O
, O
and O
penetrate O
to O

lone O
boudoir O
of O
the O
mournful O
heiress O

Fortunate O
for O
her O
it O
was O
, O
that O
they O
did O
so O

for O

neither O
of O
them O
possessed O
any O
single O
quality O
of O
sufficient O
value O
to O
win O

even O
the O

such O
as O
the O
half O
- O
spoiled O
heiress O
certainly O
was O

it O
was O
better O
to O
hear O
the O
sound O
of O
almost O
any O
human O
voice O
uttering O
words O
of O
kindness O
, O
than O
to O
sit O
lonely O
and O
apart O
, O
and O
hear O
none O

so O
that O
neither O
the O
twaddling O
larum O
of O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
, O
nor O
the O
absurd O
affectation O
of O
Lady O
Clarissa S-PERSON
were O
without O
their O
use O
. O
It O
might O
, O
however O
, O
have O
been O
somewhat O
dangerous O
to O
the O
moral O
development O
of O
the O
young O
lady's O
character O
, O
had O
she O
long O
continued O
to O
find O
her O
only O
relief O
from O
sorrow O
and O
solitude O
in O
the O
society O
of O
persons O
who O
could O
only O
amuse O
her O
by O
their O
absurdities O
. O
Almost O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
she O
exerted O
herself O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
pursuing O
some O
of O
her O
ordinary O
occupations O
, O
she O
drew O
forth O
her O
drawing O
- O
box O
, O
and O
produced O
a O
caricature O
of O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa E-PERSON
reciting O
verses O
from O
the O
pen O
of O
Mr. O
Norval S-PERSON
| | O
and O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
observations O
she O
committed O
to O
paper O
, O
were O
the O
result O
of O
a O
tolerably O
accurate O
counting O
of O
the O
number O
of O
times O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
had O
uttered O
" O
Well O
now O
! O
" O
during O
her O
last O
visit O
. O
to O
express O
their O
sympathy O
, O
till O
her O
very O
soul O
sickened O
under O
the O
cuckoo O
- O
note O
of O
sorrowless O
lamentation O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
there O
was O
so O
much O
of O
real O
sadness O
in O
the O
spectacle O
of O
a O
young O
girl O
thus O
left O
utterly O
alone O
in O
the O
world O
, O
that O
despite O
the O
golden O
light O
her O
wealth O
threw O
around O
her O
, O
many O
among O
her O
herd O
of O
visiters O
might O
have O
felt O
more O
for O
her O
, O
perhaps O
, O
than O
she O
gave O
them O
credit O
for O
. O
But O
, O
unfortunately O
such O
persons O
are O
not O
those O
who O
make O
their O
" O
griefs O
and O
clamour O
roar O
" O
most O
audibly O
, O
so O
she O
knew O
nothing O
about O
it O
, O
if O
it O
were O
so O
, O
and O
thereby O
lost O
any O
advantage O
which O
her O
temper O
might O
have O
gained O
from O
emotions O
that O
soothe O
and O
soften O
. O
Instead O
of O
this O
, O
she O
had O
to O
undergo O
what O
she O
felt O
to O
be O
a O
very O
severe O
persecution O
, O
from O
the O
prodigiously O
active O
interest O
which O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
took O
in O
her O
, O
and O
her O
concerns O
. O
As O
some O
of O
the O
singularities O
of O
Miss O
Brotherton's S-PERSON
character O
, O
will O
eventually O
produce O
results O
of O
considerable O
importance O
to O
our O
hero O
, O
it O
may O
not O
be O
amiss O
to O
recount O
the O
particulars O
of O
a O
scene O
which O
took O
place O
in O
her O
boudoir O
exactly B-DATE
three I-DATE
weeks E-DATE
after O
the O
death O
of O
her O
mother O
. O
On O
the B-TIME
morning E-TIME
in O
question O
, O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
had O
as O
usual O
made O
her O
way O
unannounced O
to O
the O
young O
lady's O
presence O
, O
by O
dint O
of O
that O
assumption O
of O
extreme O
intimacy O
in O
her O
manner O
of O
inquiring O
for O
her O
, O
which O
in O
this O
case O
, O
as O
in O
a O
multitude O
of O
others O
, O
succeeded O
in O
putting O
to O
the O
rout O
the O
protecting O
discretion O
of O
her O
servants O
. O
" O

away O

little O
approaching O

her O

clear O

her O

, O
by O
her O
manner O

gravely O

looking O
earnestly O
at O

a O
great O
deal O
more O

my O
dear O
old O
friend O

must O
make O
up O
your O
mind O
to O
lead O
a O
new O
life O
altogether O

I O

that O
the O
worst O
thing O
I O

do O
to O
vex O
you O

said O
the O
young O
lady O

very O
cordially O
returning O

you O
need O
not O

afraid O

misfortune O

misfortune O

It O

no O

quite O
the O
contrary O

I O
shall O
like O
it O
very O
much O

that O
is O
the O
reason O

house O

sit O
with O
me O

take O
care O

I O
am O
too O
young O

live O
alone O

that O
all O

" O

my O
dear O

truth O

great O
fortune O

your O
prettiness O

all O

many O
an O
eye O

you O

my O
dear O
child O

, O
of O
course O

it O

for O
you O

go O
on O

some O
steady O
lady O

a O
companion O

life O
with O
a O
person O
whose O
presence O
was O
a O
pain O
to O
me O
. O
" O
Tears O
flowed O
down O
the O
cheeks O
of O
the O
heiress O
as O
she O
spoke O
| | O
and O
the O
devoted O
servant O
who O
sat O
beside O
her O
, O
though O
absolutely O
confounded O
by O
the O
strange O
proposal O
, O
could O
find O
no O
words O
to O
utter O
in O
opposition O
to O
it O
. O
" O
Dear O
nurse O
! O
— O
you O
will O
not O
forsake O
me O
, O
then O
? O
" O
said O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
smiling O
through O
her O
tears O
. O
" O
There's O
a O
dear O
soul O
— O
you O
will O
let O
me O
have O
my O
own O
way O
in O
everything O
— O
about O
your O
dress O
, O
you O
know O
, O
and O
all O
that O
? O
It O
will O
be O
worth O
any O
thing O
in O
the O
world O
to O
see O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
, O
when O
she O
first S-ORDINAL
beholds O
you O
sitting O
up O
in O
state O
in O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
! O
" O
From O
the O
moment O
the O
old O
woman O
had O
perceived O
that O
her O
beloved O
, O
but O
wilful O
darling O
, O
was O
not O
only O
serious O
, O
but O
sorrowful O
, O
and O
that O
, O
too O
, O
concerning O
no O
imaginary O
grief O
, O
but O
from O
the O
contemplation O
of O
the O
truly O
melancholy O
isolation O
of O
her O
condition O
, O
all O
disposition O
to O
resist O
her O
vanished O
| | O
and O
yet O
nurse O
Tremlett S-PERSON
was O
perfectly O
capable O
of O
perceiving O
all O
the O
inconveniences O
likely O
to O
arise O
on O
both O
sides O
from O
so O
strange O
a O
scheme O
. O
But O
even O
while O
such O
thoughts O
silently O
took O
possession O
of O
her O
, O
leaving O
perhaps O
some O
legible O
traces O
on O
her O
countenance O
, O
her O
young O
mistress O
looked O
so O
kindly O
and O
so O
coaxingly O
in O
her O
face O
, O
as O
if O
at O
once O
reading O
and O
deprecating O
all O
she O
had O
to O
say O
, O
that O
she O
felt O
nothing O
was O
left O
for O
her O
but O
obedience O
. O
smile O
and O
a O
shake O
of O
the O
head O
, O
that O
seemed O
to O
say O
, O
" O
I O
know O
you O
must O
have O
your O
own O
way O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
" O
And O
thus O
was O
conceived O
and O
established O
a O
mode O
of O
life O
for O
the O
pretty O
heiress O
, O
which O
left O
her O
as O
completely O
uncontrolled O
as O
to O
all O
she O
did O
, O
and O
all O
she O
said O
, O
as O
if O
nurse O
Tremlett S-PERSON
still O
occupied O
her O
quarters O
in O
what O
was O
once O
called O
the O
nursery O
, O
but O
had O
since O
become O
the O
favoured O
nurse's O
sitting O

room O

Mary's S-PERSON
delight O
in O
dressing O
and O
drilling O
the O
old O
woman O
for O
her O
new O
duties O
, O
was O
childish O
and O
excessive O
| | O
and O
most O
triumphant O
was O
the O
satisfaction O
with O
which O
she O
perceived O
that O
rich O
black O
silks O
, O
and O
delicate O
white O
crape O
, O
performed O
their O
office O
upon O
her O
nice O
little O
person O
so O
effectually O
, O
as O
to O
give O
her O
quite O
as O
much O
the O
air O
of O
a O
gentlewoman O
, O
as O
the O
majority O
of O
those O
who O
were O
likely O
to O
meet O
her O
. O
So O
, O
on O
the B-DATE
following I-DATE
Saturday E-DATE
, O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
found O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
no O
longer O
the O
solitary O
occupant O
of O
her O
elegant O
boudoir O
, O
but O
with O
a O
remarkably O
well O
- O
dressed O
elderly O
lady O
, O
seated O
in O
the O
most O
luxurious O
of O
all O
the O
newly O
- O
invented O
chairs O
which O
decorated O
the O
apartment O
, O
with O
a O
small O
work O
- O
table O
before O
her O
| | O
while O
on O
the O
footstool O
at O
her O
feet O
, O
sat O
the O
heiress O
, O
looking O
a O
vast O
deal O
more O
happy O
than O
she O
had O
ever O
before O
seen O
her O
. O
The O
mystification O
did O
not O
last O
long O
. O
The O
eyes O
of O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
were O
of O
that O
happy O
fabric O
, O
which O
enables O
the O
owner O
to O
retain O
for O
ever O
the O
memory O
of O
every O
face O
they O
have O
ever O
looked O
upon O
| | O
and O
it O
was O
with O
heightened O
colour O
, O
and O
no O
very O
sweet O
expression O
of O
countenance O
, O
that O
she O
exclaimed O
, O
" O
Soh S-PERSON
! O
you O
have O
taken O
your O
old O
nurse O
, O
Tremlett S-PERSON
, O
to O
sit O
with O
you O
? O
" O
" O
My O
nurse O
no O
longer O
, O
but O
my O
most O
kind O
friend O
, O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
, O
who O
has O
affectionately O
consented O
to O
forsake O
many O
of O
her O
former O
comforts O
, O
in O
order O
to O
be O
useful O
to O
me O
. O
You O
will O
perceive O
, O
ma'am O
, O
that O
your O
advice O
has O
not O
been O
lost O
upon O
me O
. O
" O
" O
Well O
now O
! O
that O
is O
a O
strange O
whim O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
. O
But O
of O
course O
, O
you O
are O
not O
serious O
in O
trying O
to O
make O
me O
believe O
that O
it O
is O
your O
intention O
to O
let O
nurse O
Tremlett S-PERSON
assist O
you O
in O
receiving O
your O
company O
. O
If O
it O
be O
so O
, O
I O
think O
it O
but O
fair O
to O
tell O
you O
at O
once O
, O
as O
my O
experience O
is O
rather O
greater O
than O
yours O
, O
that O
not O
one S-CARDINAL
single O
soul O
among O
all O
our O
rich O
folks O
, O
will O
care O
to O
visit O
you O
at O
all O
. O
I O
don't O
wish O
to O
affront O
you O
, O
nurse O
Tremlett S-PERSON
| | O
but O
you O
won't O
contradict O
what O
I O
say O
, O
I O
am O
quite O
sure O
of O
that O
. O
" O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
showed O
herself O
an O
apt O
scholar O
, O
for O
she O
bowed O
her O
head O
, O
went O
on O
with O
her O
knitting O
, O
and O
said O
nothing O
. O
If O
any O
one O
now O
in O
existence O
really O
loves O
me O
, O
it O
is O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON

and O
I O
, O
too O
, O
most O
sincerely O
love O
her O

therefore O
I O
flatter O
myself O
, O
that O
drawing O
tighter O
the O
tie O
that O
has O
long O
united O
us O
, O
will O
occasion O
pain O
to O
neither O
. O
If O
the O
obscure O
tradition O
I O
have O
heard O
respecting O
my O
grandfather O
be O
correct O
, O
he O
received O
much O
kindness O
when O
travelling O
the O
country O
as O
an O
itinerant O
tinker O
from O
Mrs. O
Tremlett's S-PERSON
father O
, O
then O
a O
flourishing O
farmer O
in O
Yorkshire S-GPE
. O
So O
you O
perceive O
, O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
, O
that O
I O
am O
really O
honoured O
by O
the O
association O
. O
But O
if O
any O
one O
should O
fancy O
the O
contrary O
— O
if O
any O
one O
should O
feel O
that O
the O
luxuries O
of O
my O
house O
and O
table O
— O
the O
only O
attractions O
I O
know O
of O
, O
by O
which O
I O
may O
hope O
to O
draw O
my O
neighbours O
round O
me O
— O
if O
any O
should O
feel O
that O
the O
value O
of O
these O
are O
lessened O
by O
the O
presence O
of O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
, O
they O
must O
give O
them O
up O
. O
For O
the O
price O
I O
shall O
put O
upon O
my O
good O
dinners O
and O
fine O
balls O
, O
will O
be O
the O
most O
courteous O
and O
kind O
politeness O
to O
that O
dear O
and O
valued O
friend O
. O
And O
now O
that O
we O
have O
finally O
and O
for O
ever O
dismissed O
this O
subject O
, O
will O
you O
tell O
me O
if O
I O
may O
hope O
for O
the O
pleasure O
of O
your O
company O
at O
dinner O

- O
day O

Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
? O
" O
From O
this O
period O
, O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
never O
quitted O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton E-PERSON
, O
excepting O
when O
the O
heiress O
accommodated O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa I-PERSON
Shrimpton E-PERSON
by O
the O
use O
of O
her O
carriage O
, O
when O
they O
were O
both O
going O
to O
visit O
at O
the O
same O
mansion O
: O
an O
arrangement O
which O
had O
often O
taken O
place O
during O
the O
late O
Mrs. O
Brotherton's S-PERSON
lifetime O
, O
and O
which O
was O
of O
such O
very O
obvious O
mutual O
convenience O
, O
that O
one O
was O
rarely O
invited O
without O
the O
other O
. O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
by O
degrees O
recovered O
her O
natural O
high O
spirits O
, O
and O
though O
she O
not O
unfrequently O
felt O
the O
weight O
of O
great O
loneliness O
, O
she O
was O
rapidly O
learning O
to O
enjoy O
her O
independence O
. O
She O
read O
a O
great O
deal O
, O
though O
nobody O
knew O
any O
thing O
about O
it O
. O
She O
dearly O
loved O
flowers O
, O
and O
often O
assisted O
in O
their O
culture O
with O
her O
own O
hands O
, O
despite O
her O
half B-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
dozen E-CARDINAL
gardeners O
. O
She O
laid O
out O
whole O
miles O
of O
gravel O
walks O
in O
her O
own O
grounds O
with O
almost O
as O
much O
skill O
as O
went O
to O
form O
the O
Cretan S-NORP
labyrinth O
, O
in O
order O
that O
she O
might O
walk O

walk O
, O
without O
passing O
her O

lodge O

gates O
, O
and O
so O
running O
the O
risk O
of O
being O
called O
" O
imprudent O
" O
She O
still O
indulged O
herself O
, O
and O
with O
no O
sparing O
licence O
, O
in O
caricaturing O
her O
neighbours O

and O
, O
if O
all O
the O
truth O
must O
be O
told O
, O
derived O
no O
small O
portion O
of O
amusement O
from O
the O
variety O
of O
modes O
she O
adopted O
to O
assure O
the O
almost O
innumerable O
pretenders O
to O
her O
hand O
, O
that O
it O
was O
not O
in O
her O
power O
to O
reward O
their O
valuable O
and O
flattering O
attachments O

Such O
was O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton's E-PERSON
condition O
when O
she O
complied O
with O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa I-PERSON
Shrimpton's E-PERSON
request O

to O
drive O
over O
to O
Dowling B-FAC

the B-DATE
day E-DATE
after O

Upon O
this O
occasion O
, O
as O
upon O
many O
previous O
ones O
, O
the O
young O
lady O
, O
for O
lack O
of O
other O
amusement O
, O
occupied O
herself O
in O
selecting O
subjects O
for O
her O
merry O
pencil O

The O
best O
excuse O
to O
be O
offered O
for O
her O
offences O
in O
this O
line O
is O
, O
that O
nobody O
but O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
ever O
saw O
her O
saucy O
productions O
| | O
so O
that O
assuredly O
they O
gave O
pain O
to O
no O
one O
— O
and O
when O
the O
heart O
is O
empty O
, O
and O
the O
head O
full O
, O
much O
allowance O
must O
be O
made O
for O
such O
freaks O
and O
fancies O
. O
and O
the O
poet O
, O
her O
eye O
suddenly O
became O
fixed O
upon O
the O
beautiful O
child O
who O
had O
been O
brought O
in O
for O
general O
examination O
. O
Like O
most O
other O
ready O
limners O
of O
the O
human O
face O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
had O
considerable O
skill O
in O
physiognomy O
, O
and O
ere O
she O
had O
long O
gazed O
on O
the O
pretty O
, O
nicely O
- O
dressed O
, O
little O
boy O
, O
she O
felt O
persuaded O
that O
in O
spite O
of O
his O
gay O
habit O
de O
fête O
, O
the O
child O
was O
ill O
at O
ease O
, O
and O
under O
great O
discomfort O
. O
It O
is O
difficult O
for O
persons O
residing O
at O
a O
distance O
, O
and O
not O
" O
to O
the O
manner O
born O
, O
" O
to O
conceive O
the O
extraordinary O
degree O
of O
ignorance O
in O
which O
the O
ladies O
of O
the O
great O
manufacturing O
families O
are O
brought O
up O
, O
as O
to O
real O
condition O
of O
the O
people O
employed O
in O
the O
concern O
from O
whence O
their O
wealth O
is O
derived O
. O
There O
is O
, O
however O
, O
a O
homely O
proverb O
that O
may O
help O
to O
explain O
this O
: O
" O
You O
should O
never O
speak O
of O
a O
rope O
in O
the O
house O
of O
a O
man O
that O
was O
hanged O
, O
" O
and O
it O
is O
probably O
on O
the O
same O
principle O
, O
that O
no O
one O
speaks O
of O
the O
factory O
in O
the O
house O
of O
the O
manufacturer O
. O
Be O
this O
as O
it O
may O
, O
the O
fact O
is O
certain O
, O
and O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton E-PERSON
, O

perhaps O
a B-CARDINAL
hundred E-CARDINAL
other O
rich O
young O
ladies O
, O
of O
the O
same O
class O
, O
grew O
up O
in O
total O
ignorance O
of O
the O
moans O
and O
the O
misery O
that O
lurked O
beneath O
the O
unsightly O
edifices O
, O
which O
she O
just O
knew O
were O
called O
the O
factories O
, O
but O
which O
were O
much O
too O
ugly O
in O
her O
picturesque O
eyes O
for O
her O
ever O
to O
look O
at O
them O
, O
when O
she O
could O
help O
it O

Little O
did O
the O
kind O
- O
tempered O
, O
warm O
- O
hearted O
girl O
guess O
, O
that O
for O
hours O
before O
she O
raised O
her O
healthy O
and O
elastic O
frame O
from O
the O
couch O
where O
it O
had O
luxuriously O
reposed O
through O
the O
night O
, O
thousands S-CARDINAL
of O
sickly O
, O
suffering O
, O
children O
were O
torn O
from O
their O
straw O
pallets O
, O
to O
commence O
a O
long O
unvaried O
day O
of O
painful O
toil O
, O
to O
fill O
the O
ever O
- O
craving O
purses O
, O
of O
which O
her O
own O
was O
one O
. O
She O
knew O
that O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
was O
considered O
as O
the O
richest O
man O
in O
the O
district O
— O
richer O
even O
than O
her O
father O
had O
been O
, O
and O
this O
was O
all O
she O
knew O
about O
him O
, O
except O
that O
her O
own O
sharp O
observation O
had O
enabled O
her O
to O
perceive O
that O
he O
was O
ignorant O
, O
vulgar O
, O
and O
most O
ludicrously O
crammed O
with O
pretensions O
of O
all O
sorts O
. O
After O
having O
looked O
into O
the O
face O
of O
little O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
till O
she O
was O
perfectly O
convinced O
of O
his O
being O
exceedingly O
unhappy O
, O
she O
next O
directed O
her O
attention O
to O
his O
benefactor O
, O
as O
she O
heard O
him O
clamorously O
hailed O
on O
all O
sides O
| | O
and O
his O
countenance O
, O
though O
smiling O
, O
spoke O
a O
language O
she O
liked O
not O
. O
It O
was O
evident O
to O
her O
that O
he O
was O
very O
keenly O
watching O
the O
boy O
, O
and O
more O
than O
once O
she O
detected O
a O
look O
from O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
directed O
towards O
him O
, O
which O
was O
instantly O
followed O
by O
an O
attempt O
on O
the O
child's O
part O
to O
look O
less O
miserable O
. O
Then O
followed O
all O
the O
nonsense O
about O
Mr. O
Osmond B-PERSON
Norval E-PERSON
, O
and O
his O
promised O
drama O
, O
which O
was O
to O
place O
upon O
the O
scene O
some O
prodigiously O
generous O
action O
of O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling's E-PERSON
, O
towards O
this O
little O
boy O
. O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton E-PERSON
did O
not O
believe O
a O
word O
of O
it O
, O
and O
sick O
of O
the O
false O
and O
fulsome O
flattery O
that O
was O
bandied O
about O
between O
the O
knight O
, O
the O
lady O
, O
and O
the O
poet O
, O
she O
made O
, O
as O
we O
have O
seen O
, O
a O
somewhat O
hasty O
retreat O
. O
some O
time O
she O
suffered O
her O
ridiculous O
ladyship O
to O
run O
on O
in O
a O
violent O
strain O
of O
panegyric O
upon O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
his O
talents O
, O
and O
his O
generosity O
, O
without O
offering O
any O
interruption O
, O
but O
at O
length O
it O
struck O
her O
, O
that O
fool O
as O
she O
was O
, O
Lady O
Clarissa S-PERSON
might O
be O
able O
to O
tell O
her O
what O
she O
wanted O
to O
know O

and O
therefore O
, O
after O
answering O
" O
Indeed O
! O
" O
to O
some O
tirade O
about O
Sir O
Matthew's S-PERSON
great O
qualities O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
ventured O
to O
come O
across O
the O
torrent O
of O
her O
ladyship's O
eloquence O
by O
saying O
, O
" O
Pray O
, O
Lady O

who O
is O

little O
boy O

an O

poor O
little O
factory O

boy O

that O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
has O
most O
benevolently O
taken O
out O
of O
that O
sad O
way O
of O
life O
, O
because O
he O
behaved O
so O
remarkably O
well O

you O
call O
it O
a O
sad O
way O
of O
life O

Lady O
Clarissa S-PERSON

It O
is O
the O
way O
that O
all O

poor O
people O
get O
their O
bread O

know O

suppose O
so O

But O
yet O
, O
my O
dear O

you O
cannot O
but O
allow O
that O
it O
must O
be O
a O
very O
different O
way O
of O
life O
from O
what O
the O

parents O

from O
father O

not O

that O
good O
Sir O

his O
very O
best O

in O
Sir O

" O
" O
I O
am O
not O
quite O
sure O
about O
that O
. O
I O
believe O
it O
depends O
in O
a O
great O
degree O
upon O
the O
manner O
in O
which O
the O
little O
fellow O
behaves O

and O
so O
it O
ought O
, O
you O
know O
, O
my O
dear O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
. O
I O
rather O
think O
Mr. O
Augustus S-PERSON
was O
making O
himself O
too O
agreeable O
this B-TIME
morning E-TIME
for O
you O

hear O
much O

However O
, O
the O
exquisite O
muse O
of O
our O
friend O

will O
set O
the O
transaction O
before O
all O
the O
world O
in O
a O
proper O
point O
of O

then O
you O
, O

will O
be O
able O
to O
form O
your O
own O
judgment O
respecting O
the O
conduct O
of O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON

" O

, O
Mary S-PERSON
sunk O
into O
a O
revery O
concerning O
the O

up O

But O
it O
is O
altogether O
a O
different O
thing O
with O
the O
factory O

By O
what O
I O
can O
hear O
, O
for O
of O
course O
I O
never O
went O

The O

are O
vicious O

desolate O

taking O
drams O
often O

often O
when O
they O
ought O
to O
buy O

and O
so O
horridly O
dirty O

unthrifty O
that O
it O
is O

common O

far O

So O
I O
leave O
you O
to O
judge O

whether O
such O

could O
have O
any O

these O

" O
Mary S-PERSON
uttered O
no O

sat O
for O
many B-TIME

steadfastly O
fixed O

she O
raised O

again O
to O
the O

her O

and O
said O
, O
" O
It O
is O
then O
among O
such O

there's O
no O

that O

misfortune O

" O
" O
Why O
as O
to O
that O
, O
my O
dear O
Miss O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
there's O
many O
will O
tell O
you O
that O
it O
is O
the O
finest O
thing O
in O
the O
world O
for O
the O
places O
where O
the O
great O
factories O
are O
established O
, O
because O
they O
give O
employment O
to O
so B-CARDINAL
many I-CARDINAL
thousands E-CARDINAL
of O
men O
, O
women O
, O
and O
even O
the O
very O
smallest O
children O
that O
can O
stand O
, O
almost O
. O
But O
you O
must O
not O
ask O
me O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
what O
I O
think O
about O
that O
, O
for O
of O

I O
am O
no O
fair O

I O
, O
that O
spent O
my O
childhood O
in O
playing O
among O

raking O
up O

like O
the O
child O

I O
can O
hardly O
pass O
fair O
judgment O
on O
goings O
on O
so O
very O
different O

I O
have O
heard O
, O
my O

I O
believe O
these O
things O
are O
talked O
of O
more O
in O

among O

themselves O
, O
especially O
when O
the O

I O
have O
heard O
that O
a O
great O
many O
of O

say O
, O
that O

determined O
to O
place O
herself O
near O
her O
during O
the O
performance O
, O
in O
the O
hope O
of O
eliciting O
the O
information O
she O
was O
so O
anxious O
to O
obtain O
. O
On O
many O
occasions O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
had O
remarked O
that O
this O
young O
lady O
either O
kept O
herself O
, O
or O
was O
kept O
very O
much O
apart O
from O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
family O
, O
which O
circumstance O
had O
been O
quite O
sufficient O
to O
propitiate O
her O
kindness O
, O
for O
most O
cordially O
did O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton E-PERSON
dislike O
the O
whole O
Dowling S-PERSON
race O
. O
But O
so O
deep O
- O
seated O
was O
the O
feeling O
of O
poor O
Martha S-PERSON
herself O
that O
nobody O
did O
, O
or O
could O
wish O
, O
to O
converse O
with O
her O
, O
that O
the O
hand O
- O
shakings O
and O
smiles O
of O
the O
heiress O
had O
never O
suggested O
to O
her O
the O
idea O
that O
she O
might O
wish O
to O
be O
better O
acquainted O
. O
This O
shyness O
had O
hitherto O
effectually O
kept O
them O
apart O
| | O
but O
no O
sooner O
did O
Mary S-PERSON
perceive O
that O
the O
neglected O
girl O
was O
the O
only O
one O
of O
the O
family O
, O
above O
the O
age O
of O
a O
mere O
baby O
, O
to O
whom O
no O
part O
in O
Mr. O
Norval's S-PERSON
drama O
was O
allotted O
, O
than O
she O
resolved O
to O
profit O
by O
the O
circumstance O
, O
and O
, O
if O
possible O
, O
get O
from O
her O
such O
a O
commentary O
upon O
the O
piece O
, O
as O
might O
enable O
her O
to O
comprehend O
its O
plot O
and O
underplot O
. O
Accordingly O
, O
when O
the O
great O
night O
of O
representation O
arrived O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
reached O
the O
Lodge S-ORG
somewhat O
before O
the O
hour O
named O
in O
the O
invitation O
, O
and O
finding O
, O
as O
she O
expected O
, O
the O
room O
where O
the O
company O
were O
to O
be O
received O
, O
unoccupied O
, O
she O
desired O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
liveried O
attendants O
to O
send O
Miss O
Martha B-PERSON
Dowling's E-PERSON
maid O
to O
her O
. O
A O
female O
servant O
soon O
appeared O
. O
" O
Are O
you O
Miss O
Martha's S-PERSON
maid O
? O
" O
said O
the O
young O
lady O
. O
" O
Oh O
! O
dear O
no O
, O
ma'am O
, O
I O
am O
Miss O
Dowling's S-PERSON
and O
Miss O
Harriet's S-PERSON
maid O
. O
Miss O
Martha S-PERSON
never O
wants O
a O
lady's O
maid O
at O
all O
| | O
but O
I O
can O
take O
any O
message O
from O
you O
, O
ma'am O
, O
that O
you O
may O
please O
to O
send O
. O
" O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
took O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
her O
own O
cards O
, O
and O
wrote O
upon O
it O
with O
a O
pencil O
— O
" O
Dear O
Miss O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
if O
you O
are O
not O
going O
to O
act O
in O
the O
play O
, O
will O
you O
have O
the O
kindness O
to O
come O
to O
me O
. O
" O
This O
note O
the O
soubrette O
, O
as O
in O
duty O
bound O
, O
first S-ORDINAL
showed O
to O
her O
own O
young O
ladies O
. O
" O
Good O
gracious O
! O
How O
very O
odd O
! O
What O
can O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
have O
to O
say O
to O
Martha S-PERSON
? O
Martha S-PERSON
! O
of O
all O
people O
in O
the O
world O
. O
She O
is O
not O
ill O
, O
Crompton S-PERSON
, O
is O
she O
? O
" O
said O
Miss O
Arabella S-PERSON
. O
" O
Oh O
! O
dear O
no O
, O
ma'am O
— O
at O
least O
she O
don't O
look O
so O
. O
She O
seemed O
in O
a O
great O
hurry O
, O
however O
, O
for O
me O
to O
take O
the O
card O
. O
" O
" O
Well O
, O
take O
it O
then O
, O
" O
cried O
Miss O
Harriet S-PERSON
, O
impatiently O
, O
" O
and O
make O
haste O
, O
or O
I O
shall O
never O
get O
my O
ringlets O
done O
: O
they O
take O
such O
a O
time O
. O
Do O
give O
her O
the O
card O
, O
Arabella S-PERSON
. O
What O
good O
is O
there O
in O
spelling O
it O
over O
a O
dozen S-CARDINAL
times O
? O
I O
dare O
say O
she O
only O
wants O
to O
cross-question O
her O
about O
Augustus S-PERSON
, O
and O
what O
he's O
going O
to O
act O
. O
So O
take O
the O
card O
, O
Crompton S-PERSON
, O
and O
run O
with O
it O
to O
Martha S-PERSON
as O
fast O
as O
you O
can O
. O
" O
certain O
than O
usual O
that O
her O
presence O
would O
not O
be O
wanted O
, O
had O
made O
up O
her O
mind O
to O
enjoy O
herself O
till O
the O
time O
arrived O
for O
the O
commencement O
of O
the O
play O
, O
when O
it O
was O
her O
purpose O
to O
join O
the O
large O
party O
invited O
, O
in O
their O
progress O
from O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
to O
the O
theatre O
. O
On O
receiving O
Miss O
Brotherton's S-PERSON
card O
, O
however O
, O
she O
hastily O
resumed O
the O
business O
of O
her O
toilet O
| | O
for O
though O
the O
summons O
was O
as O
unintelligible O
to O
her O
as O
to O
her O
sisters O
, O
she O
felt O
, O
at O
least O
, O
an O
equal O
desire O
that O
it O
should O
be O
civilly O
complied O
with O
. O
It O
never O
took O
long O
to O
make O
poor O
Martha S-PERSON
as O
smart O
as O
she O
ever O
thought O
it O
necessary O
to O
be O
, O
and O
in O
a B-TIME
very I-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes E-TIME
she O
joined O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
in O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
. O
" O
This O
is O
very O
kind O
of O
you O
, O
Miss O
Martha S-PERSON
. O
I O
hope O
I O
have O
not O
hurried O
you O
? O
" O
said O
the O
heiress O
, O
taking O
her O
hand O
so O
kindly O
, O
that O
the O
shy O
girl O
could O
not O
but O
feel O
encouraged O
to O
speak O
to O
her O
with O
rather O
more O
confidence O
than O
usual O
. O
" O
Why O
are O
you O
not O
going O
to O
take O
a O
part O
? O
" O
was O
the O
next O
question O
. O
" O
I O
take O
a O
part O
! O
Oh O
! O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
what O
should O
I O
make O
of O
acting O
? O
" O
said O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
laughing O
and O
blushing O
, O
in O
reply O
. O
" O
Nay O
I O
think O
you O
are O
very O
right O
, O
Martha S-PERSON
. O
I O
assure O
you O
nothing O
could O
have O
persuaded O
me O
to O
have O
made O
the O
attempt O
. O
But O
I O
thought O
that O
if O
you O
did O
not O
play O
, O
you O
would O
perhaps O
have O
the O
kindness O
to O
take O
charge O
of O
me O
, O
and O
let O
me O
sit O
by O
you O
| | O
for O
unless O
I O
have O
somebody O
to O
tell O
me O
what O
it O
all O
means O
I O
shall O
be O
horribly O
puzzled O
. O
" O
" O
I O
will O
tell O
you O
every O
thing O
I O
can O
, O
" O
replied O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
good O
- O
humouredly O
. O
" O
But O
I O
don't O
think O
I O
understand O
much O
about O
it O
myself O
. O
" O
" O
What O
sort O
of O
a O
little O
boy O
is O
it O
that O
your O
papa O
has O
been O
so O
kind O
to O
? O
Every O
body O
is O
talking O
about O
it O
, O
and O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa E-PERSON
says O
there O
is O
something O
quite O
sublime O
in O
what O
he O
is O
going O
to O
do O
for O
him O
. O
But O
I O
suppose O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
must O
have O
remarked O
some O
qualities O
particularly O
amiable O
and O
good O
in O
the O
child O
, O
or O
he O
would O
not O
distinguish O
him O
so O
remarkably O
from O
all O
others O
of O
the O
same O
class O
. O
" O
" O
You O
have O
heard O
the O
story O
of O
his O
saving O
Lady O
Clarissa B-PERSON
Shrimpton E-PERSON
from O
the O
cow O
that O
was O
going O
to O
toss O
her O
, O
have O
you O
not O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
? O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
I O
heard O
all O
that O
, O
you O
know O
, O
the O
morning O
I O
was O
here O
| | O
— O
though O
, O
by O
the O
by O
, O
you O
were O
not O
in O
the O
room O
, O
I O
remember O
. O
But O
there O
must O
be O
something O
more O
in O
it O
than O
that O
. O
Do O
tell O
me O
all O
you O
know O
. O
" O
" O
Indeed O
I O
don't O
know O
any O
thing O
more O
, O
" O
said O
Martha S-PERSON
. O
" O
What O
sort O
of O
a O
child O
is O
it O
? O
" O
" O
A O
very O
nice O
little O
fellow O
indeed O
, O
and O
I O
think O
if O
I O
had O
been O
papa O
I O
should O
have O
done O
the O
same O
thing O
myself O
. O
" O
" O
Really O
! O
Then O
you O
do O
think O
this O
child O
is O
something O
out O
of O
the O
common O
way O
, O
I O
suppose O
? O
Pray O
tell O
me O
, O
dear O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
will O
you O
, O
if O
you O
hear O
much O
about O
the O
people O
that O
work O
in O
the O
factories O
? O
and O
the O
children O
in O
particular O
? O
" O
" O
No O
, O
indeed O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
, O
I O
know O
nothing O
in O
the O
world O
about O
them O
| | O
except O
that O
I O
sometimes O
hear O
papa O
say O
that O
they O
are O
all O
very O
idle O
and O
ungrateful O
, O
" O
replied O
Martha S-PERSON
. O
" O
I O
have O
been O
told O
that O
they O
are O
a O
very O
wretched O
set O
of O
people O
. O
But O
, O
perhaps O
, O
they O
cannot O
help O
it O
, O
Martha S-PERSON
? O
" O
returned O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
" O
I O
do O
not O
know O
how O
that O
can O
be O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
| | O
every O
body O
can O
help O
being O
idle O
, O
and O
every O
body O
can O
help O
being O
ungrateful O
, O
I O
should O
think O
. O
" O
" O
But O
it O
seems O
that O
they O
all O
live O
together O
, O
and O
make O
one O
another O
worse O
| | O
and O
, O
in O
that O
case O
, O
the O
children O
are O
very O
much O
to O
be O
pitied O
| | O
for O
, O
poor O
little O
things O
, O
they O
cannot O
help O
themselves O
. O
What O
makes O
you O
think O
this O
little O
boy O
is O
a O
nice O
child O
? O
Have O
you O
ever O
talked O
to O
him O
much O
? O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
a O
good O
deal O
| | O
but O
papa O
has O
been O
taking O
him O
about O
to O
a O
great O
many O
houses O
| | O
and O
besides O
, O
he O
has O
been O
occupied O
very O
much O
in O
learning O
his O
part O
, O
for O
Duo S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
teaching O
him O
, O
said O
that O
he O
could O
hardly O
read O
at O
all O
. O
So O
I O
have O
been O
trying O
to O
help O
him O
, O
and O
he O
is O
very O
quick O
. O
But O
I O
like O
him O
, O
too O
, O
because O
he O
appears O
so O
fond O
of O
his O
mother O
and O
brother O
. O
He O
cares O
for O
nothing O
that O
can O
be O
given O
him O
, O
unless O
he O
can O
take O
some O
of O
it O
to O
them O
. O
" O
" O
And O
does O
your O
papa O
let O
him O
do O
so O
? O
" O
" O
Oh O
! O
yes O
, O
every O
day O
. O
" O
" O
That O
is O
very O
kind O
. O
Then O
I O
suppose O
the O
little O
fellow O
is O
superlatively O
happy O
? O
" O
" O
I O
don't O
know O
, O
" O
replied O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
slight O
shake O
of O
the O
head O
. O
" O
It O
is O
very O
strange O
if O
he O
be O
not O
, O
" O
observed O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
. O
" O
If O
he O
were O
kept O
from O
his O
mother O
I O
could O
easily O
understand O
that O
he O
might O
be O
very O
miserable O
, O
notwithstanding O
the O
great O
good O
luck O
that O
has O
befallen O
him O
| | O
but O
if O
he O
is O
permitted O
to O
see O
her O
constantly O
, O
I O
can't O
imagine O
what O
he O
can O
want O
more O
. O
" O
" O
I O
don't O
know O
, O
" O
again O
replied O
Martha S-PERSON
. O
The O
expected O
guests O
began O
now O
rapidly O
to O
assemble O
, O
and O
refreshments O
were O
handed O
round O
previous O
to O
their O
being O
conducted O
to O
the O
room O
prepared O
for O
the O
evening's O
amusement O
. O
" O
Don't O
forsake O
me O
, O
dear O
Martha S-PERSON

sight O

was O
a O
beautiful O
alternation O

sure O

conqueror O

for O
her O

frightened O

On O

condition O

that O
" O
Gratitude O

close O

Lady B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
withdrew O
her O
opposition O

As O
soon O
, O
therefore O
, O
as O
Apollo S-ORG
had O
retired O
from O
the O
front O

the O
stage O
, O
no O
less B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
sixteen E-CARDINAL
male O

female O
Dowlings S-PERSON
rushed O
forth O
from O

formed O
themselves O
, O
after O
some O
little O
confusion O
, O
into O
a O
tableau O

declared O

on O
all O
sides O

to O
be O
of O
unrivalled O
beauty O

Again O
bravoes O
and O
clapping O
of O
hands O
announced O
the O
delight O
of O
the O
spectators O

and O
, O
when O
this O
was O
calmed O
, O
some O
very O
pompous O
verses O
gave O
notice O
that O
this O
display O
of O
youthful O
grace O
and O
beauty O
, O
was O
on O
occasion O
of O
a O
rustic O
fête O
, O
in O
which O
the O
dramatis O
personæ O
were O
to O
amuse O
themselves O
al O

Then O
entered O
the B-WORK_OF_ART
Lady I-WORK_OF_ART
Clarissa E-WORK_OF_ART

but O
, O
for O
some O
good O
reason O
or O
other O
, O
it O
had O
been O
decided O
, O
between O
the O
knight O

herself O
, O
that O
she O
should O
enter O
alone O
: O
and O
from O
a O
most O
poetical O
scream O
of O
terror O
, O
soon O
uttered O
by O
her O
ladyship O
, O
it O
became O
evident O
that O
a O
dragon O
, O
or O
a O
cow O
, O
or O
some O
other O
dreadful O
animal O

been O
pursuing O
her O
. O
Again O
and O
again O
, O
with O
most O
picturesque O
effect O
, O
she O
looked O
behind O
her O
towards O
the O
blue O
silk O
coulisses O
, O
from O
whence O
she O
had O
issued O
, O
till O
, O
at O
length O
, O
the O
feelings O
of O
the O
audience O
were O
worked O
up O
to O
a O
wonderful O
pitch O
, O
by O
her O
ejaculating O
— O
" O
It O
comes O
! O
It O
comes O
! O
" O
high O
, O
and O
dressed O
, O
in O
all O
respects O
, O
precisely O
as O
he O
had O
been O
on O
the O
memorable O
night O
of O
Lady B-WORK_OF_ART
Clarissa's E-WORK_OF_ART
vaccine O
adventure O
. O
In O
dumb O
show O
the O
lady O
indicated O
the O
direction O
from O
whence O
the O
dreaded O
monster O
would O
approach O

and O
the O
most O
energetic O
and O
unsparing O
action O
of O
the O
limbs O
and O
person O
secured O
the O
audience O
, O
as O
well O
as O
her O
deliverer O
, O
from O
any O
possible O
mistake O
on O
the O
subject O
. O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
too O
, O
performed O
his O
part O
with O
great O
spirit O
, O
exaggerating O
, O
as O
he O
had O
been O
commanded O
, O
by O
every O
possible O
means O
, O
the O
manævres O
necessary O
for O
turning O
the O
front O
of O
a O
cow O
. O
To O
this O
scene O
, O
too O
, O
the O
audience O
gave O
loud O
applause O
, O
and O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
it O
entered O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
, O
of O
course O
, O
greeted O
by O
bravoes O
, O
" O
long O
drawn O
out O
, O
" O
till O
the O
ladies O

gentlemen O
having O
nearly O
deafened O
one O
another O
, O
ceased O
at O
last O
, O
and O
listened O
to O
the O
beautiful O
explanation O
which O
followed O
. O
First S-ORDINAL
the O
company O
were O
made O
to O
comprehend O
that O
the O
danger O
was O
over O
, O
for O
the O
well O
- O
taught O
Michael S-PERSON
turned O
about O
, O
and O
manfully O
facing O
the O
audience O
, O
pronounced O
distinctly O
" O
The O
beast O
is O
gone O
! O
" O
Then O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
after O
bowing O
respectfully O
to O
the O
lady O
, O
said O
, O
" O
Permit O
me O

by O
this O
good O
little O
boy O

" O
It O
was O
, O
however O
, O
uttered O
in O
an O
accent O
of O
such O
temperate O
and O
measured O
feeling O
, O
that O
not O
even O
Lady B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
saw O
any O
thing O
very O
particular O
in O
it O
. O
A O
precaution O
by O
the O
way O
, O
which O
had O
been O
suggested O
by O
the O
gentlemen O
during O
the O
frequent O
rehearsals O
. O
Lady O
Clarissa's S-PERSON
acting O
then O
became O
animated O
indeed O

for O
the O
poet O
, O
following O
her O
instructions O
, O
had O
composed O
for O
her O
in O
smooth O
, O
yet O
startling O
rhymes O
, O
about O
thirty S-CARDINAL

eagerness O
of O
her O
address O
to O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
and O
now O
gracefully O
extending O
both O
arms O
towards O
the O
audience O
, O
as O
if O
to O
make O
them O
sharers O
in O
her O
generous O
emotions O
, O
she O
produced O
an O
effect O
more O
easily O
imagined O
than O
described O
. O
The O
speech O
which O
followed O
from O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
was O
very O
noble O
, O
and O
at O
once O
let O
the O
audience O
into O
all O
the O
secret O
purposes O
of O
his O
benevolent O
heart O
. O
The O
by O
- O
play O
of O
Michael S-PERSON
during O
this O
scene O
had O
been O
prepared O
for O
by O
his O
benefactor O
with O
particular O
care O
, O
but O
somehow O
or O
other O
the O
boy O
was O
not O
apt O
in O
catching O
the O
knight's O
idea O
| | O
for O
instead O
of O
the O
tender O
but O
joyous O
smile O
with O
which O
he O
had O
been O
instructed O
to O
look O
up O
into O
the O
face O
of O
his O
munificent O
patron O
, O
his O
countenance O
expressed O
nothing O
but O
terror O
. O
" O
That O
little O
fellow O
does O
not O
look O
happy O
, O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
" O
whispered O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
. O
" O
Oh O
no O
! O
he O
looks O
very O
frightened O
, O
" O
replied O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
" O
but O
that O
is O
very O
natural O
, O
is O
it O
not O
, O
considering O
the O
novelty O
of O
his O
situation O
? O
" O
" O
I O
don't O
know O
, O
" O
said O
the O
heiress O
. O
The O
piece O
went O
on O
to O
exhibit O
the O
beautiful O
manner O
in O
which O
this O
adoption O
of O
a O
ragged O
factory O
- O
boy O
into O
the O
bosom O
of O
the O
Dowling S-PERSON
family O
had O
been O
hailed O
by O
all O
of O
them O
as O
an O
especial O
grace O
from O
heaven O
, O
on O
account O
of O
the O
opportunity O
it O
afforded O
for O
relieving O
the O
overflowing O
generosity O
of O
their O
hearts O
. O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
while O
looking O
round O
upon O
his O
sixteen S-CARDINAL
full O
- O
dressed O
offspring O
, O
who O
were O
now O
again O
skilfully O
grouped O
upon O
the O
stage O
, O
was O
made O
to O
exclaim O
with O
clasped O
hands O
, O
and O
an O
almost O
sobbing O
excess O
of O
emotion O
, O
" O
The O
widow O
and O
the O
orphan O
are O
more O
dear O
, O
To O
their O
young O
hearts O
, O
than O
million B-QUANTITY
pounds E-QUANTITY
a O
year O
! O
" O
Every O
body O
was O
touched O
, O
and O
again O
the O
applause O
was O
deafening O
. O
Then O
came O
a O
very O
striking O
scene O
indeed O
. O
Michael S-PERSON
appeared O
superbly O
dressed O
, O
and O
on O
each O
side O
of O
him O
was O
a O
middling O
- O
sized O
Miss O
Dowling S-PERSON
, O
holding O
lightly O
and O
gracefully O
each O
a O
little O
basket O
, O
from O
under O
the O
covers O
of O
which O
peeped O
out O
grapes O
and O
peaches O
on O
the O
one S-CARDINAL
side O
, O
and O
something O
that O
had O
the O
semblance O
of O
a O
flask O
of O
wine O
on O
the O
other O
. O
Then O
spoke O
the O
fair O
- O
haired O
Louisa S-PERSON
. O
" O
Dear O
little O
boy O
, O
this O
basket's O
all O
your O
own O
, O
' O
Tis O
to O
reward O
the O
courage O
you O
have O
shown O
. O
" O
And O
then O
Miss O
Charlotte S-PERSON
. O
" O
So O
is O
this O
too O
, O
my O
pretty O
little O
boy O
, O
We O
hope O
' O
twill O
give O
your O
poor O
old O
mother O
joy O
. O
" O
And O
when O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
having O
received O
a O
basket O
in O
each O
hand O
, O
appeared O
preparing O
to O
depart O
, O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
young O
ladies O
exclaimed O
together O
, O
" O
' O
Tis O
papa O
sends O
it O
, O
who's O
so O
very O
kind O
, O
How O
to O
do O
good O
, O
is O
all O
he O
seeks O
to O
find O
! O
" O
Upon O
this O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
turned O
round O
again O
towards O
the O
audience O
, O
and O
stood O
stock O
still O
. O
It O
was O
quite O
evident O
that O
he O
had O
some O
speech O
to O
make O
which O
he O
had O
apparently O
forgotten O
, O
for O
it O
was O
impossible O
for O
any O
child O
to O
look O
more O
completely O
distressed O
and O
at O
a O
loss O
. O
At O
length O
it O
became O
pretty O
evident O
that O
, O
in O
lieu O
of O
all O
other O
performance O
, O
the O
poor O
boy O
was O
going O
to O
cry O
| | O
and O
some O
ingenious O
persons O
doubted O
whether O
it O
might O
not O
be O
in O
his O
part O
to O
do O
so O
| | O
but O
this O
idea O
was O
speedily O
removed O
by O
the O
very O
matter O
- O
of O
- O
fact O
pokes O
and O
nudges O
which O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
young O
ladies O
bestowed O
upon O
him O
. O
In O
addition O
to O
this O
it O
seemed O
as O
if O
the O
little O
fellow O
caught O
some O
stimulating O
sounds O
from O
the O
coulisses O
, O
for O
he O
cast O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
one E-CARDINAL
furtive O
glance O
in O
that O
direction O
, O
and O
at O
length O
, O
with O
what O
was O
evidently O
a O
great O
effort O
, O
he O
stammered O
out O
, O
" O
My O
mother's O
dear O
, O
and O
so's O
my O
brother O
too O
, O
But O
dearer O
still O
are O
your O
papa O
and O
you O
. O
His O
charity's O
so O
great O
, O
his O
heart O
so O
good O
, O
He O
gives O
the O
naked O
clothes O
| | O
the O
hungry O
food O
| | O
And O
I O
for O
— O
one O
— O
will O
, O
— O
day O
— O
and O
night O
— O
in O
prayer O
, O
Ask O
blessings O
— O
for O
— O
him O
— O
and O
— O
his O
— O
worth O
declare O
. O
" O
The O
two S-CARDINAL
last O
lines O
were O
so O
completely O
choked O
by O
the O
tears O
, O
which O
all O
his O
efforts O
could O
not O
suffice O
to O
restrain O
, O
that O
they O
were O
perfectly O
unintelligible O
to O
the O
audience O
. O
" O
Is O
all O
that O
vehemence O
of O
weeping O
a O
part O
of O
Mr. O
Norval's S-PERSON
composition O
? O
" O
inquired O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
in O
a O
whisper O
to O
Martha S-PERSON
. O
" O
Upon O
my O
word O
I O
don't O
know O
: O
but O
I O
should O
think O
not O
, O
" O
was O
the O
reply O
. O
" O
Martha S-PERSON
! O
" O
said O
the O
heiress O
, O
very O
earnestly O
, O
" O
that O
child O
is O
suffering O
from O
an O
agony O
of O
terror O
. O
" O
" O
I O
should O
hope O
not O
, O
" O
said O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
voice O
that O
somewhat O
faltered O
. O
" O
Do O
you O
know O
any O
thing O
about O
this O
boy O
? O
" O
pursued O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
, O
continuing O
her O
whispering O
. O
" O
Do O
you O
know O
any O
thing O
about O
the O
mother O
he O
talks O
of O
? O
" O
" O
Nothing O
whatever O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
. O
" O
" O
Do O
you O
feel O
quite O
satisfied O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
that O
this O
romantic O
adventure O
has O
been O
, O
or O
will O
be O
, O
advantageous O
to O
him O
? O
" O
" O
I O
think O
, O
" O
replied O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
" O
that O
one O
can O
hardly O
doubt O
his O
being O
better O
off O
here O
than O
in O
the O
poverty O
of O
his O
mother's O
dwelling O
. O
You O
saw O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
, O
what O
a O
ragged O
condition O
the O
clothes O
were O
in O
which O
he O
had O
worn O
before O
. O
" O
" O
Decent O
clothes O
are O
a O
comfort O
, O
my O
dear O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
there O
can O
be O
no O
doubt O
of O
it O
| | O
but O
compared O
with O
the O
other O
circumstances O
which O
influence O
the O
happiness O
of O
life O
, O
they O
are O
of O
no O
great O
importance O
. O
Of O
course O
I O
suppose O
that O
your O
father O
means O
to O
educate O
him O
. O
Do O
you O
know O
whether O
he O
can O
read O
his O
bible O
yet O
? O
" O
" O
I O
know O
that O
he O
could O
not O
, O
" O
replied O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
" O
when O
he O
came O
here O
. O
" O
" O
Poor O
little O
wretch O
! O
That O
is O
very O
terrible O
neglect O
somewhere O
. O
What O
sort O
of O
person O
is O
the O
mother O
? O
" O
" O
By O
Michael's S-PERSON
account O
, O
" O
replied O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
smiling O
, O
" O
she O
is O
a O
very O
estimable O
person O
indeed O
| | O
but O
it O
certainly O
seems O
that O
she O
has O
not O
taken O
much O
pains O
with O
his O
education O
, O
poor O
little O
fellow O
! O
" O
" O
What O
a O
sad O
thing O
it O
is O
, O
" O
continued O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
, O
" O
that O
we O
all O
of O
us O
know O
so O
little O
of O
the O
poor O
people O
employed O
in O
the O
factories O
! O
I O
believe O
they O
are O
said O
to O
be O
exceedingly O
well O
paid O
, O
but O
still O
I O
don't O
think O
it O
is O
quite O
right O
for O
the O
rich O
people O
in O
a O
neighbourhood O
to O
take O
no O
notice O
whatever O
of O
the O
poor O
. O
I O
know O
it O
is O
not O
so O
in O
other O
places O
| | O
for O
I O
have O
heard O
my O
schoolfellows O
continually O
talk O
of O
their O
fathers' O
tenants O
and O
work O
- O
people O
, O
and O
of O
their O
schools O
, O
and O
their O
clothing O
societies O
, O
and O
all O
sorts O
of O
things O
, O
and O
I O
have O
been O
trying O
to O
do O
a O
little O
good O
just O
at O
home O
with O
the O
families O
of O
some O
of O
the O
work O
- O
people O
about O
the O
place O
. O
But O
I O
have O
just O
now O
got O
my O
head O
strangely O
full O
of O
these O
factory O
folks O
. O
I O
wish O
you O
could O
give O
me O
some O
information O
about O
them O
, O
Martha S-PERSON
. O
" O
get O
, O
and O
yet O
papa O
says O
that O
it O
is O
the O
very O
prettiest O
lightest O
work O
in O
the O
world O
. O
And O
indeed O
I O
am O
afraid O
it O
is O
but O
too O
true O
, O
for O
this O
little O
fellow O
, O
though O
he O
is O
so O
interesting O
and O
intelligent O
that O
it O
is O
impossible O
to O
help O
liking O
him O
, O
always O
speaks O
of O
the O
factory O
as O
if O
he O
hated O
it O
. O
" O
" O
And O
if O
he O
does O
hate O
it O
, O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
why O
, O
if O
you O
question O
him O
should O
he O
conceal O
it O
? O
" O
" O
But O
I O
never O
have O
questioned O
him O
about O
that O
| | O
I O
should O
not O
think O
it O
right O
to O
do O
so O
. O
Only O
I O
remember O
his O
making O
me O
laugh O
, O
just O
after O
he O
came O
here O
, O
by O
saying O
something O
exceedingly O
naïve O
about O
their O
all O
liking O
wages O
but O
not O
work O
. O
Now O
, O
though O
I O
am O
not O
very O
deep O
in O
political O
economy O
, O
it O
is O
impossible O
not O
to O
see O
that O
poor O
people O
must O
work O
for O
what O
they O
get O
— O
don't O
you O
think O
so O
? O
" O
" O
Assuredly O
, O
and O
rich O
people O
too O
. O
I O
have O
no O
doubt O
that O
both O
your O
father O
and O
my O
father O
had O
to O
work O
very O
hard O
for O
the O
fortunes O
which O
have O
rewarded O
their O
industry O
. O
In O
our O
class O
of O
life O
this O
is O
necessary O
. O
But O
that O
does O
not O
settle O
the O
question O
that O
is O
working O
in O
my O
head O
at O
present O
, O
and O
which O
, O
to O
tell O
you O
the O
truth O
, O
will O
not O
let O
me O
sleep O
by O
night O
nor O
amuse O
myself O
by O
day O

How O
comes O
it O
that O
ALL O
the O
people O
— O
the O
only O
phrases O
I O
have O
heard O
upon O
the O
subject O
were O
very O
comprehensive O

how O
comes O
it O

Martha B-PERSON

that O
ALL O
the O
people O

believe O

Very O
bad O

But O
, O
good O
gracious O
! O
why O
are O
they O
very O
bad O

What O
is O
the O
cause O
of O
this O
strange O
degradation O
of O
one S-CARDINAL
peculiar O
class O
of O
human O

? O
It O
surely O
cannot O
arise O
from O
the O
nature O

it O
did O
, O
of O

the O

quite O
out O

me O
there O

it O
is O
impossible O

it O
not O
, O
that O
any O
labour O

be O
permitted O
, O
which O
by O
its O
nature O

of O
necessity O
, O
tended O
to O
corrupt O
the O
morals O

There O
must O
be O

started O
, O

said O
not O

there O
was O
something O
in O

awed O
her O

True O

deep O

her O

suffered O
not O
the O

presently O
resumed O
in O
a O
tone O
of O
less O
exaltation O

— O
" O
Do O
you O
think O

my O

that O
I O
could O
get O

your O
little O
Michael S-PERSON

" O
Yes O

certainly O
, O
Miss O

" O
replied O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
" O
I O
think O
papa O
would O
be O
quite O
pleased O

for O
he O
seems O

like O
nothing O
better O

take O
notice O

him O

you O

" O
I O
am O

little O
piqued O

" O
For O
it O
can O
be O
nothing O

kindness O

him O

he O
has O

eagerly O

" O
I O
have O
undertaken O
that O
business O
myself O

The O
poor O

fellow O
seemed O
to O
suffer O
so O

wonders O

up O

must O
have O

in O
the O
very O
lap O
of O
ignorance O

I O
should O
have O
thought O

all O
I O
have O
heard O

that O

him O
his O
reading O

the O
young O

laughing O

the O
little O

him O

No O

me O

care O
for O
nothing O

his O
mother O

little O
crippled O

" O
No O

indeed O

It O
is O
his O
affectionate O
temper O

him O

idle O

" O
Does O
he O
visit O

instead O

all O

up O
in O
the O
middle O

her O
head O
ached O
too O
much O

her O
way O
out O

sofa O
at O
the O
greatest O
distance O
from O
the O
imperfectly O
- O
closed O
door O
from O
whence O
the O
sounds O
issued O

but O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
had O
already O
dropped O
into O
a O
chair O
so O
near O
this O
door O
of O
communication O
that O
she O
not O
only O
heard O
, O
but O
saw O
all O
that O
was O
passing O
in O
that O
part O
of O
the O
green O
- O
room O
which O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
occupied O
. O
That O
this O
was O
the O
last O
place O
in O
which O
a O
gentlewoman O
would O
have O
been O
likely O
to O
place O
herself O
at O
such O
a O
moment O
, O
is O
most O
certain O
| | O
but O
the O
capricious O
heiress O
was O
wont O
to O
exclaim O
on O
many O
occasions O
, O
when O
observance O
and O
restraint O
were O
irksome O
to O
her O
, O
" O
I O
am O
not O
a O
gentlewoman O
— O
and O
why O
should O
I O
torment O
myself O
by O
affecting O
to O
be O
one O
. O
" O
It O
was O
probably O
by O
some O
such O
reasoning O
that O
she O
now O
justified O
to O
herself O
the O
strong O
measure O
she O
was O
adopting O
| | O
in O
order O
to O
become O
acquainted O
with O
what O
was O
passing O
behind O
the O
scenes O
respecting O
Michael B-PERSON
Armstrong E-PERSON
. O
Circumstances O
were O
favourable O
to O
the O
object O

for O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
was O
in O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
those O
towering O
fits O
of O
passion O
, O
to O
which O
his O
family O
and O
dependants O
knew O
him O
to O
be O
subject O
, O
though O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
world O
declared O
him O
to O
be O
an O
extremely O
good O
- O
natured O
man O
. O
" O
Blackguard O

" O
— O
were O
among O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
intelligible O
words O
which O
reached O
the O
heiress O
, O
after O
she O
had O
seated O
herself O
| | O
and O
these O
were O
accompanied O
by O
cuffs O
so O
heavy O
on O
the O
head O
and O
shoulders O
of O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
that O
it O
required O
a O
very O
powerful O
effort O
over O
herself O
to O
prevent O
her O
darting O
forward O
to O
seize O
the O
arm O
that O
gave O
them O
. O
But O
this O
prudent O
effort O
was O
dictated O
and O
sustained O
by O
a O
stronger O
feeling O
than O
curiosity O

and O
she O
remained O
perfectly O
still O
to O
await O
what O
should O
follow O
. O
Dr. O
Crockley S-PERSON
, O
who O
, O
though O
not O
among O
the O
corps O
of O
performers O
, O
had O
been O
permitted O
to O
be O
useful O
behind O
the O
scenes O
in O
a O
variety O
of O
ways O
, O
and O
among O
the O
rest O
had O
acted O
as O
prompter O
, O
stood O
beside O
the O
trembling O
child O
, O
and O
it O
was O
to O
his O
friendly O
ear O
that O
the O
irritated O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
addressed O
himself O

breaking O

" O
" O

too O
bad O

Dr. O

Sir O

suddenly O
quitting O
his O

akimbo O

Dr. O

his O

led O
him O
to O
the O
door O

opened O
upon O

from O
whence O
issued O

steadily O
on O

crescendo O

ended O

hardly O

her O
meditations O
lasted O

falling O
near O
her O

looking O
round O

perceived O

insensible O

shocked O
at O

did O
by O
no O

action O

the O
mind O

the O
suffering O

her O

exposed O

ran O

her O
with O
eager O
haste O

with O
much O
repentant O
tenderness O
raised O
her O
head O

did O
all O

small O
experience O
suggested O

restoring O
her O

Martha S-PERSON

with O
restored O

in O

composition O
no O

fixed O
themselves O
by O
night O

day O
upon O
one S-CARDINAL
single O
subject O
, O
while O
feeling O
that O
to O
it O
she O
was O
ready O
to O
sacrifice O
every O
thing O
else O
in O
life O
. O
On O
re-entering O
her O
house O
on O
the O
memorable O
night O
of O
the O
Dowling B-FAC
Lodge E-FAC
theatricals O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
retired O
to O
her O
apartment O
without O
even O
the O
intention O
of O
sleeping O
. O
She O
laid O
her O
head O
upon O
her O
pillow O
deliberately O
determined O
not O
to O
close O
her O
eyes O
in O
sleep O
till O
she O
had O
made O
up O
her O
mind O
as O
to O
the O
best O
way O
of O
rescuing O
the O
pale O
trembling O
child O
, O
whose O
voice O
and O
form O
haunted O
her O
, O
from O
the O
horrible O
bondage O
of O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling's E-PERSON
charity O
. O
The O
question O
was O
not O
altogether O
an O
easy O
one O
. O
She O
could O
hardly O
doubt O
that O
very O
strong O
indignation O
would O
follow O
any O
open O
effort O
on O
her O
part O
to O
interfere O
with O
a O
child O
publicly O
held O
up O
as O
the O
favoured O
object O
of O
Sir O
Matthew's S-PERSON
loudly O
- O
vaunted O
benevolence O
, O
and O
moreover O
, O
privately O
marked O
out O
by O
his O
vindictive O
nature O
as O
a O
victim O
to O
his O
hatred O
. O
Whether O
as O
a O
rival O
in O
his O
munificence O
, O
or O
a O
champion O
against O
his O
hate O
, O
it O
was O
pretty O
certain O
that O
her O
interference O
would O
render O
her O
obnoxious O
to O
her O
pompous O
neighbour's O
displeasure O
, O
and O
this O
she O
had O
no O
inclination O
to O
encounter O
if O
she O
could O
help O
it O
. O
For O
though O
at O
this O
moment O
she O
felt O
within O
her O
a O
strength O
and O
firmness O
of O
purpose O
not O
easily O
shaken O
, O
the O
poor O
girl O
knew O
that O
she O
stood O
alone O
in O
the O
world O
, O
with O
no O
friend O
to O
support O
her O
more O
powerful O
than O
nurse O
Tremlett S-PERSON
, O
and O
nothing O
but O
her O
two B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
thousand E-CARDINAL
pounds' O
worth O
of O
this O
world's O
trumpery O
to O
enable O
her O
to O
have O
her O
way O
, O
and O
her O
will O
, O
in O
many O
matters O
that O
she O
feared O
might O
turn O
out O
rather O
difficult O
to O
manage O
. O
So O
she O
determined O
to O
avoid O
quarrelling O
with O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
as O
long O
as O
she O
could O
, O
and O
though O
the O
image O
of O
Michael S-PERSON
struggling O
with O
his O
tears O
, O
and O
the O
plaintive O
sound O
of O
his O
voice O
as O
he O
pleaded O
for O
leave O
to O
labour O
again O
, O
absolutely O
haunted O
her O
memory O
, O
she O
determined O
upon O
being O
cautious O
, O
wise O
, O
and O
very O
deliberative O
in O
any O
measures O
she O
might O
eventually O
take O
to O
ensure O
his O
release O
. O
and O
conspicuous O
as O
carriage O
and O
liveries O
could O
be O
, O
and O
though O
she O
knew O
not O
precisely O
in O
what O
direction O
the O
widow O
Armstrong S-PERSON
might O
be O
found O
, O
it O
was O
easy O
enough O
to O
guess O
that O
did O
she O
make O
use O
of O
her O
ordinary O
mode O
of O
conveyance O
in O
reaching O
her O
abode O
, O
let O
it O
be O
where O
it O
might O
, O
she O
would O
attract O
more O
attention O
than O
she O
desired O
. O
It O
was O
to O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
that O
she O
determined O
to O
apply O
in O
this O
dilemma O
, O
and O
at O
their O
tête O
- O
à O
- O

breakfast O
on O
the B-TIME
following I-TIME
morning E-TIME
, O
she O
once O
more O
led O
the O
conversation O
to O
the O
factories O
. O
" O
You O
must O
not O
scold O
me O
, O
dear O
friend O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
" O
if O
you O
find O
that O
I O
have O
, O
as O
I O
told O
you O
I O
would O

disobeyed O
your O
advice O
altogether O
, O
about O
thinking O
no O
more O

for O
I O
cannot O

them O
out O

" O
" O
I O
am O

my O

replied O
the O
good O

gravely O

" O
because O
I O
am O
quite O
sure O

only O
vex O
yourself O

do O
no O
good O

" O
" O
You O
ought O
to O
know O
me O
better O
by O
this O
time O
, O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
, O
than O
to O
fancy O
that O
your O
manner O
of O
speaking O
on O
this O
dark O
subject O
is O
the O
way O
to O
check O
my O
curiosity O
. O
It O
was O
pretty O
effectually O
awakened O
perhaps O
before O

but O
had O
it O
been O
otherwise O
, O
what O
you O
say O
would O
be O
quite O
enough O
to O
set O
me O
upon O
inquiring O
into O
it O

Nurse O
Tremlett S-PERSON
, O
I O
WILL O
know O
every O
thing O
that O
the O
most O
persevering O
inquiry O
can O
teach O
me O
respecting O
the O
people O

whose O
labours O
all O

rich O
people O
in O
this O
neighbourhood O
owe O
their O
wealth O

myself O
among O

when O
I O
tell O
you O
that O
at O
the O
present O

this O

the O
only O
subject O

I O
feel O

" O
" O

such O

spirit O

no O

world O

only O
to O
get O
my O
own O

do O
me O
the O
justice O
to O
anticipate O
that O
I O
shall O
not O
be O
less O
obstinate O
in O
this O
one O
thing O
, O
that O
I O
believe O
to O
be O
right O
, O
than O
in O
all O
the O
many O
wherein O
it O
was O
most O
likely O
I O
suspected O
myself O
to O
be O
wrong O

I O
do O
believe O

that O
it O
is O
my O
duty O

understand O

if O
this O

I O
will O
trust O
to O
God O

make O
up O
to O
me O
for O
all O
the O
vexation O
your O
prophecy O
threatens O
it O
will O
bring O
. O
" O

If O
that O
is O
the O
way O
you O
think O
of O
it O
, O
my O
dear O
child O
, O
Heaven O
forbid O
that O
I O
should O
seek O
to O
hinder O
you O
. O
But O
rich O
as O
you O
are O
, O
dear O
Mary S-PERSON

if O
you O
was O
to O
give O
it O
all O

ten B-CARDINAL
thousand E-CARDINAL
times O
as O
much O
besides O
, O
what O
good O
could O
it O
do O
? O
The O
mills O
would O
go O
on O
just O
the O
same O
you O
know O

" O
articles O
useful O
to O
man O
, O
without O
rendering O
those O
employed O
upon O
it O
unfit O
to O
associate O
with O
the O
rest O
of O
their O
fellow O
- O
creatures O
? O
This O
seems O
to O
me O
so O
gross O
an O
absurdity O
that O
I O
cannot O
give O
faith O
to O
it O
, O
and O
therefore O
I O
suspect O
that O
the O
depravity O

wickedness O
you O
and O
Miss O
Martha B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
talk O
about O
, O
must O
arise O
from O
these O
people O
having O
too O
much O
money O
at O
their O
command O
. O
This O
, O
perhaps O
, O
may O
lead O
to O
intemperance O
and O
extravagance O
. O
Don't O
you O
think O
this O
may O
be O
the O
case O
, O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
? O
" O
" O
Good O
gracious O
, O
no O

Miss O
Mary S-PERSON
! O
Why O
they O
are O
all O
the O
very O
poorest O
starving O
wretches O
upon O
earth O
. O
" O
" O
But O
they O
may O
be O
poor O
because O
they O
are O
extravagant O
, O
nurse O
. O
They O
must O
get O
a O
most O
monstrous O
quantity O
of O
money O
, O
for O
though O
none O
of O
the O
gentlemen O
ever O
talk O
much O
of O
their O
factories O
, O
I O
have O
repeatedly O
heard O
allusion O
made O
to O
the O
enormous O
sums O
paid O
every B-DATE
week E-DATE
to O
the O
work O
- O
people O
. O
And O
it O
is O
quite O
clear O
that O
all O
the O
families O
must O
get O
a O
great O
deal O
, O
because O
all O
the O
little O
children O
work O
, O
which O
can O
hardly O
be O
the O
case O
elsewhere O
. O
Now O
, O
I O
cannot O
help O
thinking O
, O
nurse O
, O
that O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
good O
might O
be O
done O
by O
teaching O
them O
a O
little O
economy O
, O
and O
inducing O
them O
to O
lay O
by O
their O
superfluous O
money O
in O
a O
savings O
- O
bank O
. O
That O
is O
one S-CARDINAL
great O
reason O
why O
I O
want O
to O
get O
acquainted O
with O

this O

the O
reason O

a O
devilish O
shake O
he O
gave O
to O
the O
system O
just O
at O
first S-ORDINAL

by O
his O
absurd O
bill O
for O
the O
protection O
of O

such O
men O

not O

ninepins O

either O
by O
law O

makers O

or O
law O

and O
to O
say O
the O
truth O
, O
old O
Sir O
Robert B-PERSON
Peel's E-PERSON
bill O
was O
to O
all O
intents O
and O
purposes O
a O
dead O
letter O
within O
two B-DATE
years E-DATE
after O
it O
was O
passed O
. O
Bless O
your O
soul O
, O
it O
was O
the O
easiest O
thing O
in O
the O
world O
to O
keep O
the O
creatures O
so O
ignorant O
about O
the O
bill O
, O
after O
first S-ORDINAL
talk O
was O
over O
, O
the O
they O
might O
have O
been O
made O
to O
believe O
any O
thing O
and O
to O
submit O
to O
any O
thing O
. O
In O
fact O
the O
question O
for O
them O
always O
lies O
in O
an O
egg O
- O
shell O
. O
They O
must O
either O
do O
what O
the O
masters O
would O
have O
them O
, O
OR O
STARVE O
. O
That O
fact O
is O
worth O
all O
the O
bills O
that O
ever O
were O
passed O
: O
and O
another O
thing O
is O
, O
that O
as O
long O
as O
there's O
nothing O
to O
prevent O
our O
own O
friends O
and O
relations O
from O
being O
among O
the O
magistrates O
, O
even O
if O
complaints O
are O
made O
, O
we O
can O
manage O
them O
. O
" O
" O
How O
true O
it O
is O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
that O
there O
is O
no O
inequality O
of O
accidental O
condition O
that O
can O
equal O
the O
inequality O
produced O
by O
a O
decided O
superiority O
in O
the O
intellectual O
powers O
, O
" O
said O
Dr. O
Crockley S-PERSON
. O
" O
At O
this O
moment O
I O
give O
you O
my O
sacred O
honour O

upon O
, O
you O
and O
your O
friend O
Mr. O
Elgood B-PERSON
Sharpton E-PERSON
also O
, O
as O
standing O
in O
a O
much O
more O
commanding O
position O
than O
any O
duke O
in O
the O
country O

What's O
a O
long O
descent O
compared O
to O
a O
long O
head O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
? O
I'll O
tell O
you O
what O
the O
difference O
is O
. O
A O
long O
descent O
pretty O
generally O
helps O
a O
man O
to O
empty O
his O
purse O
, O
whereas O
a O
long O
head O
will O
never O
fail O
to O
help O
him O
fill O
it O
. O
It O
is O
as O
clear O
to O
me O
, O
as O
that O
the O
sun's O
in O
heaven O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
that O
the O
game O
is O
in O
your O
own O
hands O
. O
I O
know O
— O
for O
I O
have O
made O
some O
curious O
experiments O
that O
way O
— O
I O
know O
what O
a O
dog O
may O
be O
taught O
to O
do O
by O
hunger O
, O
and O
you O
may O
rely O
upon O
it O
that O
it O
is O
just O
as O
powerful O
in O
a O
man O
. O
Egad S-PERSON
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
it O
is O
a O
very O
fine O
subject O
for O
scientific O
experiments O
. O
It O
is O
difficult O
to O
say O
how O
far O
it O
might O
go O
. O
If O
a O
dog O
, O
for O
example O
, O
may O
be O
taught O
tricks O
by O
hunger O
, O
that O
approach O
in O
ingenuity O
to O
the O
powers O
of O
man O

why O
may O
not O
man O

skilfully O
acted O
upon O
by O
the O
same O
principle O

brought O
to O
rival O
the O
docility O
of O
a O

" O
" O
I O
see O
nothing O
in O
nature O
to O
stop O
it O
, O
doctor O

replied O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
with O
an O
air O
of O
great O
animation O

" O
But O
remember O
, O
my O
dear O
Crockley S-PERSON

this O
is O
not O
a O

the O
private O

our O

have O
just O
as O
much O
right O

inquire O
at O
what O

my O

expects O
his O

what O
the O

eats O
for O
breakfast O
when O
he O

up O

hired O
laborers O
keep O

what O
they O
feed O
upon O

It O
is O
a O
gross O
inquisitorial O
interference O

not O

a O
first S-ORDINAL

rate O
idea O

you O

is O

out O

Mr. O

it O
may O
be O
worth O
thinking O
about O

perhaps O
, O
practically O

scientifically O

certainly O

should O

A B-DATE

utility O

it O
properly O

caught O
you O
idea O

thoughts O

sending O

" O
" O
Exactly O
so O
, O
my O
dear O

we O
must O
have O
indentures O

there O
is O
some O
little O
difficulty O

I O
suppose O
you O
know O
best O

else O
I O
should O
say O
that O

From O
your O
description O
, O
the O
locality O
of O
this O
factory O

with O
its O
romantic O
name O

at O

in O
one O
particular O
— O

that O
without O

happy O

would O
find O
it O
impossible O

" O
Difficult O

to O
tell O
you O
the O
truth O

I O
should O
not O

get O
the O
brat O

ADVENTURE O

only O
did O
the O
self O
- O
willed O
heiress O
yeild O
to O
the O
judgment O
of O
her O
companion O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
who O
knew O
, O
that O
though O
she O
seldom O
went O
beyond O
the O
shelter O
of O
her O
own O
park O
- O
paling O
, O
she O
often O
walked O
without O
fatigue O
within O
it O
for O
two B-TIME
or I-TIME
three I-TIME
hours E-TIME
together O
, O
wished O
to O
set O
off O
for O
Hoxley B-FAC
- I-FAC
lane E-FAC
on O
foot O
| | O
but O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
talked O
so O
much O
of O
the O
fatigue O
, O
that O
the O
good O
- O
natured O
girl O
consented O
to O
let O
the O
carriage O
convey O
them O
to O
the O
point O
at O
which O
the O
lane O
diverged O
from O
the O
high O
- O
road O
. O
This O
yielding O
, O
however O
, O
was O
wholly O
from O
consideration O
for O
her O
companion O
. O
For O
herself O
she O
believed O
the O
precaution O
quite O
needless O
| | O
and O
she O
was O
right O
. O
However O
much O
her O
temper O
might O
have O
been O
endangered O
by O
the O
series O
of O
spoiling O
processes O
she O
had O
undergone O
, O
her O
health O
had O
been O
taken O
good O
care O
of O
, O
and O
few O
girls O
of O
her O
age O
in O
any O
rank O
, O
had O
greater O
power O
and O
will O
for O
exertion O
than O
herself O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
before O
she O
had O
driven O
half B-QUANTITY
a I-QUANTITY
mile E-QUANTITY
, O
she O
heartily O
rejoiced O
at O
having O
sacrificed O
her O
own O
inclination O
to O
that O
of O
her O
good O
nurse O
| | O
for O
the O
road O
to O
Ashleigh S-PERSON
was O
the O
favourite O
ride O
of O
the O
officers O
quartered O
in O
the O
neighbourhood O
, O
and O
had O
she O
been O
seen O
on O
foot O
, O
it O
is O
probable O
that O
before O
reaching O
Hoxley B-FAC
- I-FAC
lane E-FAC
she O
would O
have O
been O
surrounded O
by O
a O
body O
- O
guard O
of O
military O
. O
So O
greatly O
did O
this O
danger O
appal O
her O
spirits O
, O
that O
the O
frist O
moment O
she O
found O
herself O
free O
from O
a O
white O
- O
gloved O
hand O
either O
at O
one S-CARDINAL
window O
or O
the O
other O
, O
she O
stopped O
the O
carriage O
, O
and O
ordered O
the O
coachman O
to O
go O
far O
enough O
down O
the O
lane O
to O
permit O
her O
to O
ge O
out O
unoberserved O
by O
any O
persons O
passing O
by O
the O
road O
. O
But O
poor O
Mary S-PERSON
was O
this O
day O
doomed O
to O
disappointment O
| | O
and O
the O
indignant O
, O
and O
almost O
passionate O
beating O
of O
her O
heart O
under O
it O
, O
made O
her O
more O
conscious O
, O
perhaps O
, O
than O
she O
had O
ever O
been O
before O
, O
how O
deeply O
the O
business O
upon O
which O
she O
was O
engaged O
had O
entered O
into O
her O
soul O
. O
Soon O
after O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
had O
dismissed O
his O
breakfast O
companion O
, O
he O
strolled O
out O
towards O
his O
splendid O
stables O
, O
and O
perceiving O
his O
son O
loitering O
among O
the O
grooms O
, O
and O
himself O
equipped O
for O
the O
saddle O
, O
he O
inquired O
whither O
he O
was O
going O
to O
ride O
. O
" O
Only O
to O
Ashleigh S-PERSON
, O
governor O
, O
" O
was O
the O
reply O
. O
" O
Then O
wait O
five B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
, O
Augustus S-PERSON
, O
and O
I O
will O
ride O
with O
you O
. O
" O
Whether O
the O
youth O
approved O
the O
proposal O
or O
not O
, O
he O
was O
fain O
to O
submit O
to O
it O
, O
and O
the O
evil O
star O
of O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton E-PERSON
contrived O
to O
bring O
them O
to O
the O
top O
of O
Hoxley B-FAC
- I-FAC
lane E-FAC
at O
the O
moment O
her O
carriage O
was O
about O
to O
turn O
into O
it O
. O
" O
Stop O
! O
" O
cried O
the O
young O
lady O
, O
accompanying O
the O
word O
with O
a O
very O
energetic O
pull O
at O
the O
check O
- O
string O
. O
" O
Go O
on O
to O
Ashleigh S-PERSON
, O
" O
was O
the O
order O
the O
followed O
. O
" O
Was O
ever O
any O
thing O
so O
provoking O
, O
nurse O
? O
Do O
you O
see O
who O
those O
hateful O
men O
are O
? O
" O
" O
Why O
' O
tis O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
my O
dear O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
gentle O
old O
woman O
. O
" O
The O
wretch O
! O
" O
muttered O
Mary S-PERSON
between O
her O
teeth O
at O
the O
very O
moment O
that O
sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
on O
one S-CARDINAL
side O
, O
and O
his O
languishing O
son O
on O
the O
other O
, O
besieged O
her O
carriage O
. O
thought O
she O
, O
as O
with O
a O
face O
suffused O
with O
the O
deepest O
carmine O
that O
agitation O
could O
produce O
, O
she O
forced O
her O
lips O
into O
an O
unmeaning O
smile O
in O
return O
to O
their O
salutation O
. O
The O
father O
and O
son O
came O
to O
exactly O
the O
same O
conclusion O
, O
and O
at O
the O
same O
moment O
. O
There O
was O
but O
one S-CARDINAL
cause O
that O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
assign O
for O
her O
evident O
emotion O
. O
She O
was O
deeply O
in O
love O
with O
Augustus S-PERSON
, O
— O
more O
deeply O
then O
even O
the O
young O
man O
himself O
had O
imagined O
. O
The O
thing O
was O
plain O
, O
no O
doubt O
remained O
, O
no O
not O
a O
shadow O
of O
it O
on O
the O
mind O
of O
either O
father O
or O
son O
, O
but O
it O
was O
the O
elder O
gentleman O
only O
who O
at O
once O
determined O
to O
push O
so O
fine O
a O
game O
to O
its O
close O
, O
with O
as O
little O
delay O
as O
possible O
. O
Feeling O
quite O
sure O
that O
there O
was O
no O
liberty O
he O
could O
take O
at O
this O
moment O
which O
would O
not O
be O
welcome O
, O
he O
made O
a O
sign O
t O
the O
coachman O
to O
stop O
, O
and O
deliberately O
dismounting O
he O
threw O
his O
reins O
to O
his O
groom O
, O
told O
Miss O
Brotherton's S-PERSON
footman O
to O
open O
the O
carriage O
- O
door O
, O
and O
stepped O
in O
with O
the O
assumed O
air O
of O
a O
partially O
loved O
friend O
, O
who O
knows O
that O
no O
leave O
need O
be O
asked O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
shrunk O
back O
into O
her O
corner O
with O
considerably O
more O
disgust O
than O
if O
a O
reptile O
had O
possessed O
itself O
of O
the O
seat O
opposite O
. O
" O
This O
is O
not O
quite O
as O
it O
should O
be O
, O
is O
it O
? O
" O
said O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
leer O
. O
" O
Perhaps O
so O
me O
other O
may O
have O
a O
better O
right O
here O
than O
I O
? O
" O
And O
a O
very O
expressive O
smile O
accompanied O
the O
words O
. O
" O
Sir O
? O
" O
said O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
. O
" O
Come O
, O
come O
, O
my O
dear O
child O
, O
you O
must O
not O
look O
vexed O
at O
any O
of O
my O
little O
jokes O
. O
You O
know O
how O
we O
all O
dote O
upon O
you O
! O
Dear O
creature O
! O
How O
beautiful O
that O
sweet O
blush O
make O
you O
look O
! O

, O
he O
! O
there O
goes O
poor O
Augustus S-PERSON
looking O
very O
much O
as O
if O
he O
could O
wring O
his O
papa's O
neck O
off O
. O
But O
his O
turn O
, O
we O
will O
hope O

may O
come O
by O

by O
. O
and O
now O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
I'll O
tell O
you O
what O
I O
am O
come O
here O
for O
. O
We O
all O
want O
you O

your O
good O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
too O
, O

she O
likes O
it O

to O
come O
over O
to O
us O
quite O
en O
famille O
to O
- O
morrow O

I O
don't O
know O
what O
love O
- O
powder O
you O
have O
been O
scattering O
amongst O
us O
, O
but O
there O
is O
not O
a O
single O
individual O
of O
the O
family O
who O
does O
not O
positively O
dote O
upon O
you O
. O
Tell O
me O
my O
pretty O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
do O
you O
feel O
a O
little O
kindness O
for O
some O
of O
us O
in O
return O
? O
" O
An O
attempt O
to O
take O
her O
hand O
accompanied O
this O
speech O
| | O
and O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
, O
who O
estimated O
pretty O
nearly O
her O
young O
lady's O
affection O
for O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
and O
his O
race O
, O
actually O
trembled O
for O
the O
consequences O
. O
But O
, O
to O
her O
great O
surprise O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
answered O
, O
after O
the O
pause O
of O
a B-TIME
minute E-TIME
, O
" O
Oh O
, O
dear O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
! O
you O
are O
only O
laughing O
at O
me O
! O
" O
in O
a O
voice O
so O
exceedingly O
chilldish O
and O
silly O
, O
that O
it O
might O
, O
under O
similar O
circumstances O
, O
have O
made O
the O
fortune O
of O
a O
comic O
actress O

and O
though O
she O
did O
not O
permit O
him O
to O
touch O
the O
hand O
he O
attempted O
to O
take O
, O
she O
placed O
it O
, O
together O
with O
its O
fellow O
, O
so O
playfully O
behind O
her O
, O
that O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
could O
only O
laugh O
and O
call O
her O
, O
" O
dear O
pretty O
creature O

" O
Meanwhile O
the O
carriage O
proceeded O
to O
penetrate O
through O
the O
dirty O
dismal O
streets O
, O
which O
, O
in O
that O
direction O
, O
formed O
the O
suburb O
of O
Ashleigh S-GPE

" O
I O
must O
get O
out O
here O

Miss O

suddenly O
pulling O
the O
check O

to O
the O
ground O
the O

the O
door O

The O
knight O
was O
fain O
to O
follow O

the O
animated O
Augustus S-PERSON
threw O
himself O
from O
his O
horse O
at O
the O
same O
instant O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
held O
herself O
suspended O
on O
the O
step O
of O
the O
carriage O
to O
learn O
what O
she O

approaching O

half S-CARDINAL

at O
each O
side O

, O
crouching O

sat O
a O
pale O

squalid O

The O
eldest O
might O
be O
ten B-DATE

the O

certainly O
not O

Miss O

exclaimed O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON

" O
Surely O
, O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
, O
you O
ought O
to O
prevent O
your O

from O
exposing O
herself O

such O
scenes O

" O
" O
Good O

, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
do O
not O
let O
me O
detain O
you O
, O
" O
said O
the O
heiress O
, O
suddenly O
assuming O
the O
tone O
and O
style O
of O
a O
woman O
of O
fashion O
who O
chose O
to O
have O
her O
own O
way O

" O
These O
sick O
little O
creatures O
quite O
interest O
me O

I O
must O
positively O
find O
out O
who O
Billy B-PERSON

" O
" O
It O
is O
an O
instrument O

Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
. O
You O
know O
not O
to O
what O
you O
are O
exposing O
yourself O
— O
fraud O
, O
filth O
, O
infection O
, O
drunkenness O
! O
I O
give O
you O
my O
sacred O
honour O
that O
I O
think O
you O
are O
very O
likely O
to O
be O
robbed O
and O
murdered O
if O
you O
approach O
the O
thresholds O
of O
such O
dwellings O

" O
" O
I O
beg O
your O
pardon O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
" O
replied O
the O
heiress O
, O
" O
but O
you O
must O
excuse O
me O
if O
I O
obstinately O
persevere O
in O
judging O
for O
myself O

I O
know O
I O

a O
spoiled O
child O

neither O
more O

as O
such O
you O
must O
either O

me O
up O

bear O
with O
me O

Permit O
me O
to O
wish O
you O
good O
morning O

I O
shall O
do O
more O
than O

the O
threshold O
of O
this O
dwelling O

I O
shall O
enter O
it O
. O
" O
Having O
said O
this O
, O
she O
waited O
no O
further O
parley O
, O
but O
taking O
a O
ragged O
child O
in O
each O
hand O
set O
her O
little O
foot O
against O
the O
door O
which O
already O
stood O
ajar O
, O
pushed O
it O
open O
, O
and O
walked O
in O
. O
who O
could O
tell O
if O
fraud O
and O
drunkenness O
might O
not O
enter O
the O
moment O
after O
, O
to O
complete O
the O
group O
? O
But O
there O
was O
little O
of O
selfishness O
and O
much O
of O
courage O
in O
the O
heart O
of O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton E-PERSON
, O
so O
she O
presently O
forgot O
every O
notion O
of O
personal O
danger O
, O
and O
was O
thus O
enabled O
to O
see O
things O
as O
they O
really O
were O
. O
On O
one S-CARDINAL
side O
of O
the O
small O
bare O
chamber O
, O
and O
in O
some O
degree O
sheltered O
by O
the O
door O
which O
opened O
against O
it O
, O
stood O
a O
rickety O
machine O
once O
intended O
for O
a O
bedstead O
. O
Two S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
legs O
had O
given O
place O
to O
brickbats O
, O
and O
instead O
of O
a O
bed O
the O
unsteady O
frame O
now O
supported O
only O
a O
thin O
layer O
of O
very O
dirty O
straw O
, O
with O
the O
body O
of O
a O
dying O
female O
stretched O
upon O
it O
. O
The O
only O
other O
article O
of O
furniture O
in O
the O
room O
was O
an O
old O
deal O
box O
without O
a O
cover O
, O
but O
having O
a O
couple O
of O
planks O
, O
each O
about B-QUANTITY
three I-QUANTITY
feet E-QUANTITY
long O
, O
laid O
across O
it O

serving O
either O
for O
table O

chairs O
as O
occasion O
might O
require O

The O
walls O
, O
the O
floor O
, O
the O
ceiling O
, O
and O
the O
remnant O
of O
a O
window O
, O
were O
all O
alike O
begrimed O
with O
smoke O
and O
dirt O
. O
It O
took O
not O
long O
to O
make O
this O
inventory O
, O
and O
having O
completed O
it O
, O
the O
young O
lady O
, O
still O
holding O
in O
each O
hand O
a O
staring O
child O
, O
turned O
towards O
the O
inhabitant O
of O
this O
miserable O
den O
, O
and O
said O
, O
" O
Are O
you O
ill O
, O
my O
good O
woman O
? O
" O
The O
being O
she O
addressed O
raised O
her O
heavy O
eyes O
, O
and O
in O
a O
voice O
so O
low O
as O
to O
be O
scarcely O
intelligible O
, O
answered O
" O
Yes O

" O
" O
Have O
you O
no O
assistance O

" O
Nobody O

these O

pointing O
to O
the O
children O
. O
" O
Has O
any O
doctor O
seen O
her O
? O
" O
demanded O
Mary S-PERSON
of O
the O
eldest O
child O
. O
" O
No O
ma'am O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
little O
girl O
. O
" O
And O
how O
long O
has O
she O
been O
ill O
? O
" O
" O
Ever O
since O
she O
com'd O
from O

how O
long O
is O
that O
? O
" O
" O
A O
twelvemonth O

" O
said O
the O
little O
one O
. O
" O
I O
don't O
know O

" O
said O
the O
elder O
. O
" O
But O
, O
my O
poor O
children O

you O
are O
not O
the O
only O
people O

you O

said O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON

shuddering O
. O
" O
There's O
Sophy S-PERSON
, O
and O
Dick S-PERSON

Grace S-PERSON

replied O
the O
eldest O
child O
. O
" O
Where O
are O

all O

" O
again O
inquired O
Miss O

" O
At O
the O

" O
was O
again O
the O

up O

" O
" O
Sophy S-PERSON

answered O
the O
child O
, O
" O
and O
Grace S-PERSON
, O
almost O
. O
" O
" O
Then O
why O
do O
they O
not O
stay O
at O
home O
, O
one S-CARDINAL

them O
at O

not O
big O
enough O
to O
take O
care O

child O

Why O
don't O
you O
go O

the O
factory O

" O
— O
and O
as O
she O
spake O
, O
the O
child O
held O
up O
a O
little O
shrivelled O
right O
- O
hand O
, O
three S-CARDINAL
fingers O
of O
which O
had O
a O
joint O
deficient O
. O
" O
I O

won't O

said O
the O
little O
one O
, O
slipping O
her O
arm O
out O
of O
a O
bedgown O
( O
which O
was O
the O
only O
garment O

, O
and O
displaying O
the O
limb O
swollen O

discoloured O

from O
some O
violent O
contusion O
. O
" O
My O
poor O
little O
creature O
! O
how O
did O
you O
do O
this O
? O

said O
Mary S-PERSON

tenderly O
, O
taking O
the O
little O
hand O
in O
hers O
, O

examining O
the O
frightful O
bruise O
. O
" O
' O
Twas O
the O
billy O

roller O
, O
" O
said O
the O
little O
girl O
, O
in O
an O
accent O
that O
seemed O
to O
insinuate O
that O
the O
young O
lady O
was O
more O
than O
commonly O
dull O
of O
apprehension O
. O
" O
But O
how O
did O
it O
happen O
, O
my O
child O

" O
" O
No O
! O
— O
That O

cried O
the O
elder O
, O
with O
a O
loud O
voice O
, O

again O
holding O
up O
her O
demolished O
fingers O

" O

for O

construed O
Mary's S-PERSON
puzzled O
look O
into O
an O
expression O
of O
displeasure O
. O
" O
They O
beats O
' O

dreadful O
ma'am O
, O
" O
said O
the O
sick O
woman O
, O
evidently O
exerting O
herself O
beyond O
her O
strength O

" O

these O
bruises O

Mary S-PERSON

again O
examining O

" O
There O
was O
something O
so O
hollow O
, O
so O
sunken O
in O
the O
woman's O
voice O
, O
that O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
felt O
terrified O

The O
fact O
that O
a O
child O

baby O
before O
her O

been O
beaten O
with O
such O
a O
weapon O
, O
and O
with O
such O
violence O
, O
seemed O
wholly O
incredible O
. O
Again O
she O
thought O
of O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling's E-PERSON
warning O

wished O
that O

" O
I O

Mary S-PERSON
stopped O

half O

a- O
crown O
from O
her O
purse O

she O
put O
into O
the O
child's O

She O
looked O
at O
the O
coin O

in O
a O
half O

whisper O
ejaculated O

Then O
creeping O
to O
the O
bed O

she O
put O
it O
into O
the O
palm O
of O
her O
mother's O
hand O

pressing O
the O
fingers O
down O
upon O
it O

in O
an O
accent O
of O
interrogation O
uttered O
the O
word O
" O
Bread O

This O
Mary S-PERSON
heard O
, O
but O
not O
the O
answer O
to O
it O
, O
for O
she O
had O
quitted O
the O

On O
opening O
the O
door O
of O

started O
at O
seeing O
Sir O

a B-QUANTITY
dozen I-QUANTITY

extended O
to O
keep O
the O

the O

resting O
against O
the O

on O
the O

the O

while O
his O
head O
thrust O
forward O
within O
an O
inch O
of O
good O
Mrs. O
Tremlett's S-PERSON
nose O
effectually O
prevented O
her O
following O

much O
she O
might O

wished O

, O
indeed O

upon O
Miss O
Brotherton's S-PERSON
disappearance O
reseated O
the O
good O
woman O
almost O
by O
force O

then O
addressed O
her O
in O
such O
a O
strain O
as O
was O
rapidly O
working O
her O
up O
to O
make O
an O

the O
reappearance O

death O
she O
still O
drinks O

that O

" O
Sir O

was O
in O
the O
act O

pronouncing O
the O
last O
words O

this O
speech O
as O
Miss O

opened O
the O
door O

stepped O
out O

On O
first S-ORDINAL
perceiving O
her O

the O
knight O
appeared O
about O

take O
her O
hand O

for O
the O
purpose O

replacing O
her O
in O

his O
attention O
was O
called O
to O
the O
sound O
of O
many O
feet O
suddenly O
turning O
the O
corner O
of O
a O
street O
which O
led O
from O
a O
neighbouring O
factory O

It O
proceeded O
from O
the O
workpeople O

were O
rushing O
home O

scrambling O
haste O

snatch O
their O
miserable O
dinners O

Gentlemen O
in O
Sir O

situation O
, O
and O
enjoying O
the O
species O
of O
influence O
which O
belongs O
to O
it O

take O
little O
or O
no O
pains O
to O
avoid O
meeting O
the O
people O

themselves O
employ O

They O
look O
not O
in O
the O
young O
eyes O
to O
read O
what O
sort O
of O
blessing O
cowers O
there O

heed O
the O
crippled O
gait O

pallid O
visage O
of O
those O
who O
exist O
but O
by O
the O
poisonous O
employment O
which O
he O
gives O
them O

But O
such O
gentlemen O
seldom O
, O
if O
they O
can O
avoid O
it O

expose O
themselves O
to O
the O
remarks O
of O
any O
gangs O

to O
their O
neighbours O

no O
sooner O
did O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
become O
aware O
that O
the O
mill O
in O
the O
next O
street O
was O
pouring O
forth O
its O
fifteen B-CARDINAL
hundred E-CARDINAL
hands O
, O
than O
he O
turned O
from O
the O
young O
lady O

had O
passed O
by O
without O
appearing O
to O
see O
him O

taking O
his O
horse O
from O
the O
hand O
of O
the O
groom O

held O
it O
, O
sprung O
with O
great O
activity O
into O
the O
saddle O
, O
and O
galloped O
off O
the O
way O
his O
indignant O
son O
had O
galloped O
before O
him O
. O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton E-PERSON
meanwhile O
was O
utterly O
unconscious O
of O
the O
approaching O
throng O

intent O
only O
upon O
getting O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
out O
of O
the O
carriage O
, O
turned O
her O
eyes O
neither O
to O
the O
right O
nor O
the O
left O
, O
but O
seizing O
her O
by O
the O
arm O

exclaimed O
, O
" O
Come O
to O
me O
nurse O

come O
to O
me O

" O
The O
good O
woman O
who O
was O
quite O
as O
desirous O
as O
herself O
of O
the O
reunion O
, O
required O
no O
second S-ORDINAL
summons O
, O
but O
more O
quickly O
than O
it O
can O
be O
told O
, O
was O
first S-ORDINAL
by O
the O
side O
of O
her O
young O
mistress O
in O
the O
street O
, O
and O
then O
entering O
with O
her O
the O
low O
door O
of O
the O
dwelling O
so O
fearfully O
described O
by O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON

Had O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
possessed O
the O
power O

most O
assuredly O

would O
have O
turned O
the O
steps O
of O
her O
charge O
the O
other O
way O

for O
ever O
have O
prevented O
her O
from O
exposing O
herself O
to O
the O
contemplation O
of O
such O
depravity O
as O
she O

heard O
described O

knowing O
perfectly O
well O
that O
no O
such O
power O
was O
vested O
in O
her O
, O
the O
next O
wish O
she O
conceived O
, O
was O
to O
give O
all O
the O
assistance O

support O

could O
to O
the O
dear O
wilful O
girl O
to O
whom O
she O
had O
devoted O
herself O

Aware O

as O
she O
entered O
the O
door O

that O
many O
eyes O
followed O
them O

, O
that O
many O
steps O
were O
stayed O

apparently O
, O
to O
watch O
the O
spectacle O
so O
rare O
in O
Ashleigh S-PERSON
of O
well O
- O
dressed O
ladies O
entering O
the O
sordid O
dwelling O
of O
operatives O
, O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
herself O
closed O
the O
door O
as O
soon O
as O
they O
had O
both O
passed O
through O
it O
, O

looking O
round O
upon O
the O
desolation O
of O
the O
chamber O

trembled O

an O
emotion O
made O
up O
of O
terror O

compassion O

perceiving O
to O
what O
a O
scene O
the O
delicately O
- O
nurtured O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton E-PERSON
had O
introduced O
herself O

" O
This O
woman O
is O
very O
ill O
, O
nurse O

said O
the O
young O
lady O

drawing O
her O
close O

away O

the O
doctor O

answered O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON

positively O
shaking O
from O
head O
to O
foot O
, O
as O
she O
contemplated O
the O
ghastly O
countenance O
of O
the O
woman O
, O
the O
filthy O
rag O
that O
imperfectly O
covered O
her O
, O
and O
the O
scanty O
straw O
upon O
which O
her O
stiffening O
limbs O
were O
stretched O

" O

is O
no O
place O

we O
will O
send O
the O
doctor O

feel O
her O
pulse O

" O
These O
words O
though O
spoken O
very O
quietly O
and O
deliberately O
, O
were O
uttered O
in O
a O
voice O
so O
unlike O
what O
she O
had O
ever O
heard O
from O
the O
young O
lady O
before O
, O
that O
the O
old O
woman O
became O
dreadfully O
alarmed O
. O
" O
Oh O
, O
good O
God O
! O
she O
is O
losing O
her O
senses O
! O
" O
were O
the O
words O
she O
uttered O
as O
she O
threw O
her O
arms O
round O
the O
person O
of O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
, O
and O
vainly O
attempted O
to O
remove O
her O
from O
the O
spot O
on O
which O
she O
stood O
. O
moment O

" O
Without O
answering O
a O
word O
the O
terrified O
old O
woman O
hastened O
to O
obey O
her O
, O
and O
did O
so O
in O
the O
best O
manner O

for O
calling O
to O
the O
tall O
footman O

who O
continued O
to O
stand O
beside O
the O
open O
door O
of O
the O
carriage O

he O
obeyed O
the O
summons O
, O
which O
he O
supposed O
to O
be O
preparatory O
to O
his O
young O
mistress O
making O
her O
exit O
, O
by O
very O
unceremoniously O
thrusting O
right O

left O
the O
curious O
group O
that O
still O
lingered O

" O
Give O
me O
the O
cushions O
from O
the O
carriage O

Jones S-PERSON
, O
" O
she O
said O
, O
" O
make O
haste O
, O
for O
God's O
sake O
! O
" O
The O
man O
stared O
at O
her O
for O
an O
instant O
in O
utter O
astonishment O
, O
and O
then O
did O
as O
he O
was O
ordered O
. O
" O
Now O
get O
upon O
the O
box O
and O
bid O
the O
coachman O
drive O
as O
fast O
as O
he O
can O
go O
, O
to O
the O
nearest O
doctor's O
— O
that's O
Mr. O
Thomas S-PERSON
, O
I O
think O
, O
in O
Cannon B-FAC
- I-FAC
street E-FAC
. O
— O
Tell O
him O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
has O
sent O
for O
him O
, O
and O
desire O
him O
to O
get O
into O
carriage O
directly O
. O
" O
Having O
uttered O
these O
commands O
as O
rapidly O
as O
she O
could O
speak O
, O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
carried O
a O
couple O
of O
the O
carriage O
cushions O
to O
the O
bed O
, O
and O
with O
the O
assistance O
of O
Mary S-PERSON
and O
the O
elder O
child O
, O
managed O
to O
raise O
the O
woman O
into O
a O
position O
apparently O
less O
distorted O
and O
painful O
than O
before O
. O
" O
Have O
you O
any O
thing O
to O
give O
her O
? O
" O
said O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
, O
addressing O
the O
child O
. O
The O
little O
girl O
without O
answering O
, O
stepped O
to O
a O
sort O
of O
cupboard O
in O
the O
wall O
, O
and O
taking O
thence O
a O
pitcher O
without O
a O
spout O
, O
and O
a O
mug O
without O
a O
handle O
, O
contrived O
to O
tilt O
up O
the O
former O
so O
as O
to O
make O
it O
discharge O
a O
portion O
of O
its O
cotents O
into O
the O
latter O
. O
" O
It O
is O
water O
, O
" O
said O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
watching O
the O
operation O
. O
" O
It O
will O
not O
hurt O
her O
, O
will O
it O
? O
" O
" O
Nothing O
can O
hurt O
her O
, O
my O
dear O
love O
? O
" O
replied O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
, O
her O
eyes O
filling O
with O
tears O
as O
she O
listened O
to O
the O
altered O
voice O
of O
her O
gay O
- O
hearted O
girl O
, O
whose O
smiles O
and O
frolics O
she O
had O
watched O
, O
and O
indulged O
, O
for O
so B-DATE
many I-DATE
years E-DATE
| | O
but O
of O
whose O
deep O
feeling O
she O
had O
never O
conceived O
any O
idea O
till O
now O
. O
" O
I O
don't O
think O
anything O
can O
hurt O
her O
now O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
Her O
pulse O
flutters O
, O
and O
her O
forehead O
is O
quite O
damp O
. O
I O
have O
sent O
for O
Mr. O
Thomas S-PERSON
, O
and O
he O
will O
probably O
be O
here O
immediately O
. O
" O
Mary's S-PERSON
only O
answer O
was O
silently O
pressing O
the O
hand O
of O
her O
old O
friend O
as O
she O
took O
from O
it O
the O
broken O
mug O
of O
water O
, O
and O
then O
, O
kneeling O
on O
the O
sordid O
floor O
, O
she O
applied O
it O
to O
the O
pale O
dry O
lips O
of O
the O
sufferer O
. O
The O
poor O
woman O
made O
an O
effort O
to O
meet O
it O
, O
and O
swallowed O
a O
mouthful O
eagerly O
| | O
and O
then O
, O
relieved O
probably O
by O
the O
change O
of O
posture O
, O
and O
refreshed O
by O
the O
cool O
liquid O
, O
she O
stretched O
out O
the O
hand O
in O
which O
she O
still O
held O
Mary's O
half O
- O
crown O
, O
and O
said O
, O
" O
Go O
Betsy O
, O
buy O
— O
" O
The O
child O
she O
addressed O
, O
eagerly O
seized O
the O
money O
in O
the O
hand O
that O
had O
fingers O
to O
close O
upon O
it O
, O
and O
flitted O
through O
the O
door O
in O
an O
instant O
. O
more O
tranquil O
, O
and O
Mary S-PERSON
hoped O
she O
had O
fallen O
asleep O
. O
With O
this O
persuasion O
she O
stood O
perfectly O
still O
and O
silent O
beside O
her O
, O
her O
own O
hand O
locked O
, O
though O
she O
was O
not O
conscious O
of O
it O
, O
in O
the O
grasp O
of O
her O
deeply O
affected O
nurse O
, O
while O
her O
whole O
soul O
seemed O
settled O
in O
her O
eyes O
as O
she O
fixed O
them O
immovably O
upon O
what O
she O
felt O
to O
be O
the O
most O
awful O
spectacle O
that O
a O
mortal O
can O
gaze O
upon O
, O
namely O
, O
the O
passing O
of O
a O
human O
spirit O
from O
life O
to O
death O
. O
The O
little O
girl O
whose O
swollen O
and O
discoloured O
arm O
still O
remained O
uncovered O
, O
probably O
because O
she O
feared O
the O
pain O
likely O
to O
attend O
the O
replacing O
it O
in O
the O
sleeve O
, O
stood O
close O
beside O
her O
mother's O
head O
, O
childishly O
contemplating O
the O
cushions O
which O
supported O
it O
, O
and O
apparently O
as O
unconscious O
as O
they O
were O
, O
of O
the O
heavy O
loss O
that O
threatened O
her O
. O
But O
this O
stillness O
did O
not O
long O
remain O
uninterrupted O
. O
All O
the O
members O
of O
the O
family O
, O
who O
had O
been O
named O
as O
belonging O
to O
the O
factory O
, O
except O
the O
father O
, O
returned O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
taking O
such O
rest O
and O
refreshment O
as O
one B-TIME
hour E-TIME
( O
nearly B-CARDINAL
half E-CARDINAL
of O
which O
was O
consumed O
by O
the O
walk O
to O
and O
from O
the O
mill O
) O
could O
permit O
. O
The O
latch O
was O
lifted O
by O
the O
eldest O
girl O
, O
a O
delicate O
featured O
, O
but O
dreadfully O
dirty O
creature O
of O
about B-CARDINAL
seventeen E-CARDINAL
, O
with O
a O
sort O
of O
sharp O
eagerness O
, O
denoting O
the O
curiosity O
excited O
by O
the O
sight O
of O
the O
carriage O
stationed O
before O
their O
dwelling O
. O
On O
perceiving O
the O
deathlike O
countenance O
of O
her O
mother O
, O
made O
distinctly O
visible O
by O
the O
noonday O
light O
, O
that O
streamed O
through O
the O
open O
door O
, O
she O
suddenly O
stopped O
, O
clasping O
her O
hands O
together O
, O
and O
uttering O
in O
tones O
that O
sounded O
like O
a O
shriek O
— O
" O
Oh O
! O
God O
, O
she O
is O
dead O
! O
" O
" O
No O
! O
not O
dead O
! O
" O
said O
Mary S-PERSON
solemnly O
, O
and O
without O
turning O
her O
eyes O
from O
the O
object O
on O
which O
they O
were O
rivetted O
. O
" O
Not O
dead O
! O
— O
she O
is O
sleeping O
— O
Hush O
! O
— O
Do O
not O
disturb O
her O
! O
" O
Close O
following O
on O
the O
heels O
of O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
, O
came O
a O
second S-ORDINAL
girl O
, O
about O
a O
year O
her O
junior O
, O
but O
with O
a O
countenance O
much O
less O
prepossessing O
. O
Dirty O
she O
was O
too O
, O
it O
possible O
more O
so O
than O
the O
others O
, O
and O
there O
was O
a O
look O
of O
stolid O
stupidity O
about O
her O
that O
, O
but O
for O
the O
sort O
of O
reckless O
audacity O
which O
lurked O
in O
her O
eye O
, O
might O
have O
given O
the O
idea O
of O
an O
almost O
brutal O
want O
of O
animation O
. O
A O
thin O
consumptive O
- O
looking O
lad O
of O
about B-CARDINAL
fourteen E-CARDINAL
, O
followed O
after O
her O
, O
and O
closed O
the O
door O
behind O
him O
as O
he O
entered O
. O
" O
Oh O
! O
mother O
! O
" O
he O
exclaimed O
as O
her O
sunken O
face O
caught O
his O
eye O
, O
" O
I O
wish O
I O
was O
alongside O
of O
ye O
, O
and O
then O
we'd O
be O
buried O
together O
! O
" O
And O
without O
appearing O
conscious O
of O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
strangers O
, O
he O
suddenly O
threw O
himself O
upon O
the O
tottering O
bedstead O
, O
and O
nestling O
his O
face O
close O
to O
that O
of O
the O
dying O
woman O
, O
kissed O
her O
passionately O
again O
and O
again O
. O
but O
with O
distended O
and O
tearless O
eyes O
, O
that O
seemed O
to O
speak O
more O
of O
fear O
than O
love O
. O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
looked O
anxiously O
into O
the O
face O
of O
her O
charge O
. O
It O
was O
deadly O
pale O
, O
and O
wore O
an O
expression O
of O
solemnity O
so O
new O
and O
strange O
, O
that O
the O
good O
woman O
threw O
her O
arms O
around O
her O
in O
an O
agony O
of O
fond O
anxiety O
, O
exclaiming O
, O
" O
My O
Mary S-PERSON

my O
dear O

" O
Then O
after O
a O
short O
pause O
, O
during O
which O
her O
eyes O
were O
closed O
, O
and O
her O
hands O
crossed O
upon O
her O
breast O
, O
she O
again O
whispered O
, O
" O
Could O

the O
old O

tears O

down O

cheeks O

" O

be O
satisfied O

approaching O
the O
bed O

leaning O
over O
the O
girl O

knelt O
beside O
it O
, O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
in O
a O
low O
but O
distinct O
voice O
pronounced O
the O
words O
, O
" O
Shall O
we O
pary O
with O
you O

" O
She O
was O
evidently O
heard O

understood O
, O
for O
the O
hands O
that O
for O
some B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
had O
lain O
motionless O
, O
were O
with O
an O
effort O
brought O
together O
, O
and O
clasped O
in O
the O
attitude O
of O
prayer O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
who O
was O
eagerly O
watching O
her O
every O
movement O
, O
suddenly O
stepped O
forward O
, O
and O
gliding O
in O
between O
the O
eldest O
and O
the O
youngest O
girl O
, O
dropped O
on O
her O
knees O
beside O
them O
. O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
following O
close O
behind O
her O
, O
knelt O
also O
, O

then O
with O
tremlbing O
lips O
, O
and O
faltering O
voice O

but O
slowly O
, O
distinctly O
, O
and O
most O
reverentially O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton E-PERSON
uttered O
the O
last O
and O
most O
impressive O
of O
those O
sentences O
in O
our O
litany O
which O
is O
followed O
by O
the O
solemn O
petition O
for O
deliverance O

it O
was O
with O
a O
throb O
of O
pleasure O
at O
her O
heart O
, O
and O
an O
exclamation O
of O
thanksgiving O
from O
her O
tongue O
, O
that O
she O
heard O
the O
dying O
woman O
answer O
" O
Amen O

Almost O
at O
the O
very O
instant O
she O
did O
so O

the O
latch O
was O
again O
lifted O

one S-CARDINAL

the O
three S-CARDINAL
medical O
practitioners O
of O
Ashleigh S-PERSON
, O
entered O

Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
was O
not O
conscious O
of O
ever O
having O
seen O
him O
before O

he O
, O
like O
every O
one O
else O
in O
the O
neighbourhood O

perfectly O
well O
knew O
the O
heiress O

sight O

now O
, O
even O
no O
, O
in O
the O
awful O
chamber O
of O
death O
, O
bowed O
low O
before O
her O
. O
It O
would O
not O
be O
easy O
to O
describe O
the O
feeling O
with O
which O
she O
turned O
away O
from O
this O
ill O
- O
timed O
demonstration O
of O
respect O
. O
Yet O
it O
was O
with O
no O
harshness O
| | O
for O
the O
struggle O
so O
often O
going O
on O
within O
us O
between O
our O
better O
and O
our O
worser O
natures O
, O
was O
at O
this O
moment O
so O
decidedly O
in O
favour O
of O
all O
that O
was O
good O
in O
her O
young O
heart O
, O
that O
there O
was O
hardly O
place O
for O
any O
severer O
feeling O
than O
pity O
within O
it O

She O
had O
risen O
from O
her O
knees O
as O
he O
made O
his O
bow O
, O
and O
turning O
gravely O
towards O
him O
, O
said O
, O
" O
If O
any O
thing O
can O
be O
done O
sir O

Sophy S-PERSON
, O
the O
eldest O
girl O
seemed O
unconscious O
of O
what O
was O
going O
on O
, O
for O
she O
remained O
perfectly O
motionless O
on O
the O
spot O
where O
she O
had O
first S-ORDINAL
knelt O
down O

while O
the O
third S-ORDINAL
sister O
, O
who O
had O
been O
sent O
on O
the O
poor O
mother's O
last O
errand O
for O
bread O

who O
had O
crept O
back O
unobserved O
into O
the O
room O
during O
the O
foregoing O
scene O
, O
occupied O
the O
space O
on O
her O
right O
hand O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton E-PERSON
having O
knelt O
on O
her O
left O
, O
so O
that O
there O
was O
scarcely O
space O
for O
the O
approach O
of O
the O
smart O
apothecary O
" O
Move O
, O
my O
dear O
girls O
! O
" O
said O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
gently O
laying O
a O
hand O
on O
the O
shoulder O
of O
each O
. O
They O
both O
rose O

while O
Mr. O
Thomas S-PERSON
, O
carefully O
storing O
the O
anecdote O
in O
aid O
of O
the O
gossiping O
part O
of O
his O
practice O
, O
looked O
and O
listened O
with O
astonishment O
to O
what O
seemed O
to O
him O
the O
very O
unnatural O
conduct O
of O
the O
rich O
young O
lady O
, O
and O
internally O
exclaimed O
, O
" O
A O
clear O
case O
of O
religious O
mania O
this O
, O
as O
I O
ever O
saw O

She O
won't O
live O
long O
, O
probably O
. O
What O
a O
match O
! O
" O
It O
required O
no O
very O
long O
examination O
of O
the O
poor O
patient O
, O
to O
discover O
that O
her O
last O
moment O
was O
rapidly O
approaching O
. O
" O
Upon O
my O
word O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON

I O
really O
wish O
I O
could O
persuade O
you O
to O
come O
away O

persisted O
the O
medical O
gentleman O
as O
he O
once O
more O
turned O
towards O
her O
. O
The O
air O
is O
becoming O
more O
mephitic O

instant O

Mary S-PERSON

" O
No O

ma'am O

nothing O

the O
whole O
college O

could O
keep O
soul O

together O

I O
would O
venture O
to O
say O

" O
On O
this O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
put O
a O
fee O
into O
his O
hand O
, O
and O
bent O
her O
head O
in O
token O
that O
his O
business O
there O
was O
ended O
, O
and O
that O
he O
might O
depart O
. O
But O
he O
did O
not O
immediately O
obey O
the O
hint O
, O
for O
pocketing O
the O
unwonted O
golden O
prize O
, O
he O
seemed O
anxious O
to O
remain O
a O
little O
longer O
where O
such O
blessings O
abounded O
, O
and O
returning O
to O
the O
bed O
, O
again O
took O
hold O
of O
the O
poor O
woman's O
hand O
, O
and O
then O
said O
in O
a O
voice O
of O
authority O
— O
" O
Let O
me O
have O
some O
water O
. O
" O
It O
was O
Mary S-PERSON
only O
who O
seemed O
to O
understand O
his O
words O
, O
and O
she O
immediately O
obeyed O
them O
, O
placing O
in O
his O
hand O
the O
broken O
mug O
which O
she O
had O
set O
aside O
upon O
the O
floor O
. O
The O
apothecary O
put O
the O
water O
to O
the O
lips O
of O
the O
poor O
woman O
, O
and O
she O
again O
swallowed O
a O
little O
of O
it O
, O
after O
which O
they O
saw O
her O
lips O
move O
as O
if O
she O
was O
making O
an O
effort O
to O
speak O
to O
them O
. O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
lent O
over O
her O
, O
and O
then O
, O
with O
a O
stronger O
effort O
she O
articulated O
— O
" O
Let O
me O
see O
William S-PERSON
! O
" O
" O
Who O
is O
William S-PERSON
? O
" O
said O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
raising O
herself O
, O
" O
Is O
it O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
children O
? O
" O
" O
It O

father O

said O
Betsy S-PERSON
. O
" O
Where O
is O
he O
to O
be O
found O
? O
" O
cried O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
, O
eagerly O
. O
" O
Let O
him O
be O
sought O
for O
instantly O
— O
where O
is O
he O
likely O
to O
be O
? O
" O
" O
At O
the O
gin-shop O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
ungracious O
Grace S-PERSON
. O
" O
If O
you O
know O
where O
he O
is O

go O
for O
him O

Mary S-PERSON
, O
impressively O
, O
" O
and O
for O
God's O
sake O
let O
him O
not O
delay O
! O
" O
The O
girl O
she O
addressed O
stared O
at O
her O
as O
upon O
something O
utterly O
incomprehensible O
: O
but O
she O
obeyed O
, O
and O
, O
in O
so O
short O
a O
time O
as O
to O
show O
that O
the O
gin-shop O
was O
at O
no O
great O
distance O
, O
returned O
with O
a O
man O
of O
an O
exterior O
as O
filthy O
as O
the O
rest O
of O
his O
race O
, O
wretchedly O
crippled O
in O
the O
legs O
, O
and O
a O
complexion O
that O
spoke O
both O
of O
ill O
health O
, O
and O
intemperance O
. O
" O
What O
! O
— O
It O
is O
come O
to O
that O
, O
is O
it O
, O
already O
? O
" O
said O
the O
man O
looking O
wistfully O
at O
her O
from O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
bed O
, O
but O
with O
a O
countenance O
whose O
lines O
seemed O
too O
fixed O
in O
the O
expression O
of O
hard O
indifference O
, O
to O
permit O
its O
exhibiting O
much O
feeling O
. O
" O
She O
asked O
for O
you O
, O
father O
, O
" O
said O
Sophy S-PERSON
gently O
, O
then O
taking O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
her O
mother's O
hands O
in O
hers O
she O
murmured O
, O
" O
Mother O
! O
— O
Dear O
mother O
! O
— O
open O
your O
eyes O
upon O
us O
, O
father O
is O
here O
, O
and O
all O
of O
us O
" O
while O
large O
tear O
- O
drops O
fell O
upon O
the O
livid O
face O
as O
she O
hung O
over O
it O
. O
The O
dying O
eyes O
were O
once O
more O
opened O
, O
and O
consciousness O
, O
and O
recognition O
of O
them O
all O
, O
were O
visible O
as O
she O
suffered O
them O
to O
rest O
first S-ORDINAL
on O
one O
, O
and O
then O
on O
another O
. O
The O
boy O
only O
, O
from O
his O
position O
, O
she O
could O
not O
see O
| | O
but O
even O
then O
, O
there O
seemed O
intelligence O
between O
them O
, O
and O
she O
certainly O
knew O
he O
was O
lying O
beside O
her O
, O
for O
her O
head O
rested O
against O
his O
, O
and O
she O
raised O
her O
left O
hand O
till O
her O
fingers O
touched O
his O
cheek O
. O
The O
youngest O
child O
also O
when O
the O
mother's O
eyes O
opened O
, O
was O
too O
much O
behind O
her O
, O
but O
she O
seemed O
aware O
of O
her O
vicinity O
, O
and O
pronounced O
the O
words O
" O
Little O
one O
! O
" O
probably O
her O
usual O
appellation O
, O
so O
distinctly O
as O
to O
make O
the O
child O
start O
, O
and O
instantly O
climb O
upon O
the O
bed O
to O
kiss O
her O
. O
The O
last O
movement O
was O
an O
effort O
to O
return O
this O
kiss O
| | O
and O
the O
next O
moment O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
removed O
the O
child's O
clinging O
lips O
from O
a O
corse O
. O
A O
very O
awful O
interval O
of O
perfect O
stillness O
followed O
. O
" O
Can O
I O
be O
of O
any O
further O
service O
to O
you O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
? O
" O
from O
the O
lips O
of O
Mr. O
Thomas S-PERSON
, O
were O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
words O
that O
broke O
it O
. O
Poor O
Mary S-PERSON
only O
shook O
her O
head O
, O
but O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
replied O
, O
" O
No O
, O
thank O
you O
sir O
, O
nothing O
more O
| | O
" O
and O
with O
repeated O
bows O
, O
and O
rather O
a O
reluctant O
step O
, O
he O
departed O
| | O
turning O
, O
however O
, O
to O
give O
another O
glance O
at O
the O
heiress O
, O
as O
he O
passed O
out O
, O
for O
he O
was O
not O
without O
hopes O
that O
she O
might O
fall O
down O
in O
a O
fainting O
- O
fit O
. O
Nothing O
, O
however O
, O
of O
the O
kind O
happened O
, O
and O
he O
disappeared O
. O
" O
You O
will O
go O
now O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
dear O
" O
whispered O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
, O
" O
and O
I O
will O
come O
here O
to O
- O
morrow O
to O
inquire O
about O

" O
" O
Yes O
, O
I O
will O
go O
now O

replied O
the O
young O
lady O
, O
" O
I O
cannot O
comfort O
them O

" O
Then O
looking O
round O
upon O
the O
steadfast O
group O
, O
as O
if O
to O
discover O
which O
of O
them O
appeared O
in O
the O
fittest O
state O
of O
be O
spoken O
to O
, O
she O
fixed O
upon O
the O
little O
Betsy S-PERSON
, O
and O
placing O
a O
couple O
of O
sovereigns O
in O
her O
hand O
, O
told O
her O
to O
take O
care O
of O
them O
and O
give O
them O
to O
her O
father O
presently O
, O
adding O
, O
" O
tell O
your O
sister O
Sophy S-PERSON
to O
come O
up O
to O
my O
house O

giving O
a O
card O
, O
" O
is O
the O
place O
where O
I O
live O
. O
" O
She O
then O
led O
the O
way O
to O
her O
carriage O
, O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
followed O
, O
and O
the O
next O
moment O
they O
were O
driving O
rapidly O
from O
the O
abode O
of O
the O
most O
abject O
misery O
, O
to O
a O
residence O
which O
every O
quarter O
of O
the O
globe O
had O
contributed O
to O
render O
luxurious O
. O
It O
was O
evident O
that O
the O
heiress O
felt O
no O
inclination O
to O
converse O
| | O
indeed O
, O
for O
by O
far O
the O
greater O
portion O
of O
the O
way O
her O
face O
was O
concealed O
by O
the O
bandkerchief O
which O
she O
held O
to O
her O
eyes O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
had O
too O
much O
real O
feeling O
to O
disturb O
her O
. O
After O
driving O
, O
however O
, O
through O
the O
handsome O
lodge O
- O
gates O
, O
and O
sweeping O
up O
to O
the O
noble O
entrance O
of O
her O
mansion O
, O
where O
already O
, O
at O
the O
sound O
of O
her O
approaching O
carriage O
, O
two S-CARDINAL
or O
three S-CARDINAL
servants O
were O
seen O
waiting O
like O
a O
guard O
of O
honour O
to O
receive O
her O
, O
it O
seemed O
that O
her O
meditations O
had O
not O
been O
wholly O
confined O
to O
the O
deathbed O
scene O
she O
had O
witnessed O
, O
and O
that O
the O
sordid O
cabin O
, O
with O
its O
misery O
- O
stamped O
inhabitants O
, O
had O
made O
a O
deep O
impression O

for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
, O
and O
for O
many O
hours O
the O
only O
words O
she O
uttered O
after O
her O
return O
, O
spoken O
to O
the O
ear O
of O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
as O
they O
walked O
arm O
in O
arm O
together O
through O
the O
hall O
, O
were O
these O
: O
" O
I O
too O
am O
living O
by O
the O
profit O
of O
the O
factory O
house O
. O
Is O
the O
division O
just O
? O
— O
Oh O
, O
God O
! O
Is O
it O
holy O
? O
" O
The O
old O
woman O
felt O
that O
she O
trembled O
violently O
, O
but O
knew O
not O
what O
words O
to O
utter O
that O
might O
compose O
her O
. O
On O
arriving O
at O
the O
foot O
of O
the O
stairs O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
withdrew O
her O
arm O
, O
and O
mounting O
them O
more O
rapidly O
than O
her O
companion O
could O
follow O
, O
reached O
her O
bedchamber O
alone O

more O

the O

I O
can't O

rickety O
little O
Armstrong S-PERSON
don't O
blubber O
over O
his O
work O

he O
didn't O

was O
cleaning O
under O
the O
mules O

looked O
up O

his O
brother O

such O
good O
fortune O

him O

" O
" O
For O
a O
tolerably O
sharp O
fellow O
, O
Parsons S-PERSON
, O
you're O
devilish O
dull O
about O
this O
business O
. O
Can't O
you O
guess O
that O
I O
should O
not O
be O
taking O
all O
the O
trouble O
you O
talk O
of O
, O
about O
such O
a O
beggar's O
brat O
as O
that O
, O
unless O
I O
had O
reasons O
for O
it O
. O
There's O
that O
lord's O
daughter O
that O
got O
me O
into O
the O
scrape O
, O
won't O
she O
be O
ferreting O
and O
ferreting O
till O
she O
finds O
out O
that O
the O
sweet O
little O
master O
has O
not O
found O
himself O
comfortable O
here O
? O
And O
ten S-CARDINAL
times O
worse O
than O
her O
, O
— O
ay O
, O
a O
hundred S-CARDINAL
fold O
, O
is O
that O
obstinate O
headstrong O
girl O
of O
old O
Brotherton's S-PERSON
. O
My O
Lady O
Clarissa S-PERSON
might O
be O
troublesome O
from O
mere O
folly O
, O
and O
might O
perhaps O
be O
stopped O
short O
in O
any O
mischief O
she O
was O
doing O
, O
by O
a O
few O
words O
from O
me O
. O
But O
not O
the O
old O
one O
himself O
could O
stop O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton E-PERSON
if O
she O
got O
a O
whim O
in O
her O
head O
. O
You O
should O
have O
seen O
her O
just O
now O
, O
Mr. O
Parsons S-PERSON
, O
raving O
at O
me O
with O
her O
colour O
up O
and O
her O
eyes O
flashing O
, O
for O
all O
the O
world O
as O
if O
she O
had O
just O
escaped O
out O
of O
Bedlam S-PERSON
, O
only O
because O
I O
cautioned O
her O
against O
going O
into O
Joe B-PERSON
Drake's E-PERSON
pigsty O
, O
— O
a O
pretty O
place O
wasn't O
it O
for O
a O
girl O
of O
her O
fortune O
to O
go O
visiting O
? O
But O
in O
she O
went O
, O
by O
heaven O
! O
and O
you O
may O
rely O
upon O
it O
, O
if O
such O
a O
girl O
as O
that O
, O
who O
cares O
for O
nothing O
, O
and O
nobody O
, O
once O
gets O
it O
into O
her O
head O
to O
go O
about O
among O
the O
factory O
people O
, O
she'll O
kick O
up O
more O
dust O
than O
we O
shall O
find O
it O
easy O
to O
lay O
again O
. O
I've O
been O
told O
already O
by O
one O
who O
I O
suspect O
wanted O
to O
put O
me O
on O
my O
guard O
, O
that O
this O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton E-PERSON
wished O
to O
have O
a O
little O
talk O
with O
Michael B-PERSON
Armstrong E-PERSON
. O
I O
can O
put O
two S-CARDINAL
and O
two S-CARDINAL
together O
as O
well O
as O
Miss O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
She O
was O
at O
our O
cursed O
play O
last O
night O
, O
and O
I'll S-PERSON
bet O
my O
life O
to O
a O
rotten O
egg O
that O
she O
wants O
to O
ask O
him O
what O
he O
cried O
for O
. O
" O
" O
Likely O
enough O
, O
sir O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
overlooker O
with O
a O
grim O
smile O
. O
" O
I O
heard O
of O
the O
crying O
, O
I O
won't O
say O
that O
I O
didn't O
. O
You O
may O
guess O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
that O
it O
was O
a O
good O
deal O
talked O
about O
among O
the O
servants O
— O
and O
then O
t'other O
of O
' O
em O
blubbering O
away O
at O
the O

must O
give O
a O
pretty O
notion O

mustn't O
it O
, O
sir O

of O
your O
goodness O
to O
' O
em O
? O
" O
" O
Say O
no O
more O
about O
it O
, O
it O
makes O
me O
mad O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
the O
knight O
. O
" O
One S-CARDINAL
or O
both O
of O
' O

shall O
be O
sent O
to O
Deep B-LOC

" O
There's O
none O

in O
at O
the O

in O
the O
deep O
hollow O

Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
if O
you O
mean O
that O

" O
" O
Yes O
, O
sir O
, O
I O
do O
mean O
that O
, O
" O
replied O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
with O
a O
very O
ominous O
frown O
, O
" O

there O
Master O

shall O
go O

him O
up O

take O
his O
. O
" O
" O
That's O
all O
, O
then O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
the O
overlooker O
, O
preparing O
to O
depart O
. O
" O

put O
you O
up O

Mr. O
Parsons S-PERSON

I O
will O
take O
care O
of O
him O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
knight O
. O
Whereupon O
Mr. O
Parsons S-PERSON
made O
a O
bow O
, O
and O
departed O
. O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
had O
already O
taken O
one S-CARDINAL
tumbler O
of O
hock O
- O
and O
- O
water O
. O
He O
now O
took O
a O
second S-ORDINAL
, O
and O
then O
throwing O
himself O
back O
in O
his O
arm O
- O
chair O
, O
indulged O
for O
several B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
in O
very O
deep O
meditation O
. O
At O
the O
end O
of O
that O
time O
it O
seemed O
as O
if O
the O
good O
Rhine S-LOC
wine O
had O
done O
its O
office O
, O
for O
suddenly O
the O
knight's O
countenance O
became O
animated O
| | O
the O
heavy O
gloom O
which O
had O
rested O
upon O
it O
disappeared O
, O
and O
springing O
to O
his O
feet O
he O
rang O
the O
bell O
with O
a O
sort O
of O
lively O
jerk O
which O
showed O
he O
had O
some O
project O
in O
hand O
that O
he O
greatly O
relished O
. O
It O
was O
the O
lively O
Peggy S-PERSON
who O
answered O
the O
summons O
| | O
but O
though O
she O
entered O
almost O
out O
of O
breath O
from O
the O
eagerness O
with O
which O
she O
had O
traversed O
the O
passage O
which O
led O
from O
the O
kitchen O
to O
the O
study O
, O
and O
though O
she O
brought O
into O
immediate O
activity O
all O
the O
agaceries O
of O
which O
she O
was O
capable O
, O
a O
smiling O
nod O
was O
all O
she O
got O
in O
return O
, O
so O
eager O
did O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
appear O
to O
say O
, O
" O
Go O
to O
Miss O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
Peggy S-PERSON

as O
fast O
as O
you O

make O
haste O

a O
good O
girl O
. O
" O
Peggy S-PERSON
was O
disappointed O
and O
angry O
, O
for O
she O
had O
a O
great O
deal O
to O
tell O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
about O
Michael B-PERSON
Armstrong's E-PERSON
ungratefulness O
, O
and O
all O
that O
the O
servants O
thought O
and O
said O
about O
it O
| | O
but O
the O
command O
she O
had O
received O
was O
too O
peremptory O
to O
be O
trifled O
with O
, O
and O
though O
she O
very O
nearly O
slammed O
the O
study O
door O
in O
shutting O
it O
, O
she O
failed O
not O
to O
deliver O
her O
message O
, O
which O
was O
instantly O
obeyed O
with O
the O
most O
dutiful O
alacrity O
by O
Martha S-PERSON
. O
" O
Did O
you O
send O
Peggy S-PERSON
for O
me O
, O
papa O

" O
said O
she O
in O
entering O
. O
" O
Yes O

down O

I O
want O
to O
talk O
to O
you O
, O
Martha S-PERSON

I O
have O
got O
something O
upon O
my O
mind O

vexes O
me O

I O
am O
going O

open O
my O

you O
about O

my O
dear O

returned O
Martha S-PERSON

" O
I O
should O
be O
so O
glad O

great O
use O

comfort O

In O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
place O
you O
must O
be O
my O
father O

let O
me O
confess O
my O
faults O

you O

give O
me O
absolution O

you O
mean O

was O
particularly O
so O

know O
the O
fuss O

about O
this O
little O
fellow O

I O
have O
taken O
out O

I O
do O
assure O
you O

my O
dear O

that O
I O
really O
intended O
to O
be O
a O
very O
kind O
friend O

him O

But O
I O
got O
so O
provoked O
at O
his O
crying O
upon O
the O
stage O
last O
night O
in O
that O
beautiful O
speech O

cuffed O
him O
soundly O

came O
off O

I O
am O
sadly O
afraid O

I O
frightened O
the O
poor O
little O
fellow O
so O
violently O
that O
he O
will O
never O
feel O
comfortable O

at O
his O

And O
Martha's S-PERSON
heart O
bounded O
with O
joy O

how O
completely O
Miss O

no O

my O

tempt O
me O

give O
him O

are O
other O
reasons O
too O

my O
dear O

which O
induce O
me O
to O
think O
that O
I O
should O
be O
doing O
the O
little O
fellow O

his O

infinitely O
more O
service O

I O
apprenticed O
him O

" O
The O
excellent O
good O
sense O
of O
this O
observation O
struck O
Martha S-PERSON

very O
valuable O

she O
uttered O
the O
most O
cordial O
approbation O

the O
wisdom O

whence O
it O

exceedingly O
glad O

proceeded O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
" O
for O
I O
have O
an O
idea O
that O
you O
could O
be O
very O
useful O
in O
making O
the O
arrangement O

Do O
you O
happen O
to O
know O
where O
the O
little O

mother O
lives O

dear O

No O

papa O

but O
Michael S-PERSON
could O
show O
me O

you O
should O
have O
no O
objection O

pay O
her O
a O
visit O

this O
business O

you O
shall O

out O

you O
will O

stay O

it O
would O
perhaps O

get O
you O
the O
paper O

that O
I O
shall O
undertake O

pay O
all O

trust O
the O

her O
consent O

notion O

that O
she O
may O
lose O
the O

it O
would O
be O
really O

wicked O

You O
may O
tell O
her O

my O

shall O
continue O

be O
taught O

well O
instructed O

she O
may O
be O
quite O
easy O
about O
him O

he O
will O
be O
sure O

send O
her O
a O
letter O

with O

Sir O

some O
misgivings O

twenty B-DATE

was O
running O

more O
opposition O

he O
wished O

But O
he O
had O
a O

seldom O
remained O
long O
at O

loss O
how O

manage O

fears O

very O
angry O

you O
were O
quite O
right O

It O
is O
better O
not O
to O
harass O
him O
in O
any O
way O

Now O
then O
, O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
what O
you O
have O
got O
to O
do O

this O
: O

poor O

it O

my O
wish O

keep O
my O
promise O

for O
her O
boy O

that O
I O
am O
come O
to O
the O
persuasion O
that O
the O
apprenticing O
him O
to O
some O
respectable O
business O
will O
be O
better O
than O
letting O
him O
run O
about O

nothing O

may O
talk O

conclusion O

pointed O
out O

said O
Martha S-PERSON

in O
that O
tone O
of O
genuine O
female O

it O
is O
so O
impossible O

mistake O

the O
poor O

voice O

something O

him O
to O
slip O
his O
little O
hand O
into O
hers O

with O
a O
tolerably O
expressive O
emphasis O

Mike S-PERSON

you O
have O

comfort O

me O

the O
very O
best O
boy O

ever O
my O

had O

when O
I've O
gone O
on O
working O
with O
him O
a O
bit O
, O
two S-CARDINAL
or O
three B-DATE
months E-DATE
, O
perhaps O
, O
mother O
, O
— O
time O
enough O
for O
him O
really O
to O
find O
out O
that O
I O
am O
a O
good O
boy O
, O
— O
I O
will O
tell O
him O
all O
about O
you O

Teddy S-PERSON

make O
him O
understand O
that O

he O
wants O
to O
keep O
me O
in O
good O
heart O
to O
work O
, O
he O
must O
let O
me O
trudge O
away O
home O
to O
pass O
a O
Sunday S-DATE
now O
and O
then O
with O
you O
two S-CARDINAL
. O
I O
don't O
think O
he'll O
be O
able O
to O
say O
no O
, O
mother O
, O
when O
I O
tell O
him O
about O
Teddy's S-PERSON
poor O
legs O
, O
and O
all O
you O
have O
done O
for O
us O
both O
, O
lying O
a O
- O
bed O
here O
. O
" O
Mrs. O
Armstrong S-PERSON
again O
kissed O
her O
boy O
, O
and O
after O
gazing O
at O
him O
with O
a O
look O
in O
which O
pride O
and O
pleasure O
were O
strangely O
blended O
with O
anguish O
, O
she O
said O
, O
" O
I O
do O
think O
you'll O
make O
your O
way O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
— O
for O
you O
are O
a O
good O
boy O
, O
a O
very O
good O
boy O
. O
But O
I O
don't O
know O
how O
poor O
Edward S-PERSON
will O
take O
it O
. O
" O
" O
That's O
the O
worst O
part O
of O
it O
, O
mother O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
little O
fellow O
, O
beginning O
to O
cry O
. O
" O
Poor O
Teddy S-PERSON
does O
look O
so O
very O
happy O
of O
a O
night O
when O
he O
sees O
me O
pop O
round O
the O
corner O
upon O
him O
, O
as O
he O
comes O
out O
of O
the O
factory O
! O
— O
But O
then O
I O
shall O
be O
able O
to O
help O
him O
, O
mother O
, O
all O
the O
better O
by O
and O
by O
. O
And O
when O
I O
come O
home O
of O
a O
Sunday S-DATE
, O
mother O
, O
I O
must O
teach O
him O
to O
write O
, O
and O
then O
think O
how O
beautiful O
to O
have O
a O
letter O
from O
one O
another O
! O
I O
know O
who'll O
give O
me O
a O
slate O
for O
Teddy S-PERSON
, O
and O
me O
too O
, O
to O
learn O
with O
, O
and O
that's O
Miss O
Martha S-PERSON
. O
And O
I O
shan't O
mind O
asking O
her O
, O
not O
the O
least O
, O
because O
she O
knows O
I O
am O
going O
away O
. O
And O
do O
you O
know O
, O
mother O
, O
I've S-PERSON
got O
another O
notion O
, O
and O
that's O
no O
bad O
comfort O
neither O
. O
I O
should O
not O
a O
bit O
wonder O
, O
if O
Miss O
Martha S-PERSON
was O
to O
turn O
out O
a O
right O
good O
friend O
to O
you O
and O
Teddy S-PERSON
, O
when O
I O
am O
gone O
. O
" O
And O
so O
the O
little O
fellow O
ran O
on O
— O
each O
hopeful O
word O
he O
uttered O
begetting O
a O
new O
hope O
, O
till O
, O
by O
the O
time O
the O
hour O
of O
departure O
arrived O
, O
his O
poor O
mother O
had O
at O
least O
the O
comfort O
of O
believing O
that O
the O
prospect O
opening O
before O
him O
, O
was O
one O
that O
he O
looked O
upon O
with O
much O
less O
of O
pain O
than O
pleasure O
. O
Meanwhile O
Martha S-PERSON
found O
her O
way O
safely O
home O
, O
and O
gave O
her O
father O
such O
an O
account O
of O
the O
result O
of O
her O
mission O
, O
as O
induced O
him O
to O
give O
her O
a O
kiss O
, O
and O
declare O
that O
if O
she O
was O
not O
the O
handsomest O
of O
the O
family O
, O
she O
was O
out O

and O

out O
the O
most O
useful O

CONTINUES O
SICK O
IN O
HEART O
AND O
MIND O
— O
BUT O
IS O
ROUSED O
AND O
CHEERED O
BY O
HER O
OWN O
STEADFAST O
WILL O
— O
AN O
O'ER O
TRUE O
TALE O
. O
It O
was O
not O
till O
the O
second S-ORDINAL
dinner O
- O
bell O
had O
rung O
, O
that O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
ventured O
to O
seek O
Mary S-PERSON
in O
her O
chamber O
. O
feelings O
of O
her O
young O
mistress O
had O
been O
violently O
affected O
by O
the O
scene O
they O
had O
witnessed O
, O
and O
though O
far O
perhaps O
from O
comprehending O
the O
effect O
it O
had O
produced O
on O
her O
mind O
, O
she O
was O
conscious O
that O
she O
should O
do O
no O
good O
by O
obtruding O
herself O
uncalled O
- O
for O
upon O
her O
retirement O
. O
But O
when O
the O
signal O
that O
always O
brought O
them O
together O
had O
passed O
unheeded O
, O
she O
became O
uneasy O
, O
and O
availing O
herself O
of O
the O
privilege O
that O
long O
and O
well O
- O
requited O
affection O
gave O
, O
she O
knocked O
at O
her O
door O
and O
called O
upon O
her O
name O
. O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
answered O
the O
summons O
immediately O
| | O
but O
her O
withdrawing O
the O
bolt O
of O
her O
door O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
unchanged O
appearance O
of O
her O
dress O
, O
showed O
that O
she O
had O
not O
been O
occupied O
in O
preparing O
for O
dinner O
. O
" O
You O
are O
not O
aware O
how O
late O
it O
is O
, O
my O
dear O
child O
. O
The O
second S-ORDINAL
dinner O
- O
bell O
has O
rung O
! O
" O
said O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
looking O
anxiously O
in O
her O
pale O
face O
. O
" O
Has O
it O
? O
" O
replied O
the O
young O
lady O
| | O
" O
indeed O
, O
I O
beg O
your O
pardon O
— O
but O
I O
will O
not O
keep O
you O
waiting O
, O
I O
will O
not O
dress O
to O
- O
day O
if O
you O
will O
excuse O
it O
. O
" O
" O
No O
, O
no O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
that O
won't O
do O
. O
Never O
mind O
about O
the O
dinner O
I O
will O
tell O
them O
to O
take O
it O
out O
again O
. O
" O
" O
Indeed O
I O
do O
not O
wish O
to O
dress O
, O
" O
said O
Mary S-PERSON
languidly O
. O
" O
Morgan S-PERSON
will O
tease O
me O
by O
asking O
what O
dress O
I O
choose O
to O
wear O
and O
fifty S-CARDINAL
questions O
besides O
. O
Let O
me O
go O
down O
as O
I O
am O
, O
nurse O
Tremlett S-PERSON
. O
" O
" O
You O
shan't O
have O
Morgan S-PERSON
at O
all O
dear O
. O
The O
dressing O
will O
refresh O
you O
my O
darling O
child O
| | O
and O
it O
won't O
be O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
that O
I O
have O
done O
all O
that O
you O
wanted O
in O
that O
way O
. O
There O
— O
just O
sit O
down O
on O
the O
sofa O
for O
one B-TIME
minute E-TIME
, O
and O
I O
will O
speak O
about O
the O
dinner O
, O
and O
be O
back O
again O
. O
" O
It O
was O
very O
passively O
that O
Mary S-PERSON
did O
as O
she O
was O
bid O
, O
and O
without O
another O
word O
of O
remonstrance O
sat O
down O
and O
awaited O
the O
return O
of O
her O
old O
friend O
. O
She O
was O
indeed O
completely O
exhausted O
, O
the O
scene O
she O
had O
witnessed O
had O
not O
touched O
only O
, O
it O
had O
wrung O
her O
heart O
| | O
and O
the O
hours O
she O
had O
passed O
since O
, O
were O
not O
such O
as O
to O
bring O
her O
spirits O
back O
to O
their O
ordinary O
tone O
. O
It O
was O
not O
alone O
, O
the O
melancholy O
spectacle O
of O
a O
fellow O
- O
creature O
passing O
from O
life O
to O
death O
, O
which O
had O
thus O
strongly O
affected O
her O
— O
it O
was O
the O
frightful O
degradation O
of O
the O
group O
of O
human O
beings O
who O
had O
gazed O
upon O
it O
with O
her O
. O
It O
was O
the O
horrible O
recollection O
of O
the O
dying O
woman's O
statement O
respecting O
the O
lacerated O
flesh O
of O
her O
child O
— O
and O
it O
was O
the O
filth O
, O
the O
misery O
, O
the O
famine O
, O
and O
the O
vice O
that O
she O
had O
been O
warned O
of O
, O
and O
had O
seen O
, O
which O
had O
set O
her O
powerful O

healthy O
, O
unprejudiced O
, O
and O
unselfish O
mind O
, O
to O
meditate O
upon O
the O
state O
of O
things O

had O

aching O
infant O
limbs O

rarely O
failed O
to O
despatch O
with O
nearly O
equal O
regularity O
( O
all O
booked O
for O
the O
same O
region O

a O
plentiful O
portion O
of O
benevolent O
lamentations O
over O
the O
sable O
sons O
of O
Africa S-LOC

all O
uttered O
comfortably O
from O
a O
soft O
arm O

was O
gently O
going O
on O

most O
perfect O
enjoyment O

On O
the O
slavery O
question O
therefore O
Mary S-PERSON
really O
knew O
a O
great O
deal O
, O

felt O
concerning O
it O

as O

the O
degree O

them O

of O
all O

Mary B-PERSON

as O
the O
sleek O
lapdog O

dozed O
upon O

hearth O

But O
this O
carefully O

adjusted O
cloud O
was O
now O
passing O
away O

intellect O
for O
ever O

If O
" O
Where O
ignorance O
is O
bliss O
, O
it O
is O
folly O
to O
be O
wise O
, O
" O
that O
folly O
had O
seized O
upon O
her O
| | O
for O
no O
longer O
was O
she O
destined O
to O
taste O
the O
doubtful O
joy O
of O
luxury O
that O
had O
never O
looked O
upon O
the O
seamy O
side O
of O
existence O

dreamed O

the O
means O
that O
supplied O
its O
exquisite O
, O
yet O
almost O
unnoted O
refinements O
, O
were O
earned O
by O
the O
agony O
of O
labouring O
infants O

But O
though O
this O
, O
worse O
than O
fools O
paradise O
, O
was O
thus O
closed O
upon O
her O
for O
ever O

felt O
a O
power O

energy O
of O
purpose O
awaked O
within O
her O
heart O

that O
she O
thanked O
God O
upon O

bended O

giving O

she O
trembled O

it O

and O
she O
went O
through O
the O
business O
of O
the O
dinner O
- O
table O
so O
tranquilly O
, O
that O
her O
watchful O
companion O
felt O
rejoiced O
, O
though O
a O
little O
surprised O
, O
at O
her O
recovered O
composure O
. O
Soon O
after O
they O
retired O
from O
table O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
proposed O
a O
walk O
in O
the O
grounds O
, O
and O
as O
they O
wandered O
together O
through O
the O
richly O
- O
scented O
flower O
- O
garden O
, O
and O
then O
seated O
themselves O
where O
the O
cool O
breeze O
of O
evening O
brought O
the O
tempered O
fragrance O
to O
their O
senses O
more O
delightfully O
still O
, O
the O
feverish O
feeling O
of O
tightness O
across O
her O
forehead O
, O
seemed O
to O
relax O
, O
and O
as O
if O
to O
apologise O
for O
the O
silent O
fit O
that O
had O
seized O
her O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
looked O
kindly O
into O
the O
face O
of O
her O
old O
friend O
, O
and O
then O
bent O
forward O
and O
kissed O
her O
. O
" O
Bless O
you O
, O
my O
dear O
love O
! O
you O
feel O
better O
now O
, O
don't O
you O
? O
" O
said O
the O
affectionate O
old O
woman O
. O
" O
Yes O
, O
dear O
nurse O
— O
much O
better O
. O
The O
air O
is O
delicious O
to O
- O
night O
. O
" O
" O
It O
was O
too O
much O
for O
you O
, O
my O
dear O
child O
, O
that O
dreadful O
scene O
this B-TIME
morning E-TIME
! O
My O
dear O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
you O
must O
be O
reasonable O
, O
indeed O
you O
must O
, O
or O
instead O
of O
making O
me O
the O
very O
happiest O
being O
in O
the O
world O
as O
you O
do O
now O
, O
my O
life O
will O
become O
one O
of O
continual O
terror O
and O
alarm O
. O
You O
can O
do O
no O
good O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
in O
putting O
yourself O
in O
such O
places O
as O
we O
were O
in O
to O
- O
day O
. O
" O
Mary S-PERSON
reflected O
for O
a O
moment O
before O
she O
answered O
her O
, O
and O
then O
said O
, O
" O
Are O
you O
quite O
sure O
, O
nurse O
Tremlett S-PERSON
that O
a O
young O
woman O
without O
any O
natural O
ties O
whatever O
, O
and O
with O
a O
fortune O
so O
large O
as O
mine O
, O
can O
do O
no O
good O
by O
making O
themselves O
acquainted O
with O
the O
condition O
of O
their O
poor O
neighbours O
? O
" O
" O
Oh O
! O
no O
, O
Miss O
Mary S-PERSON
dear O
, O
I O
never O
said O
that O
. O
You O
do O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
good O
by O
putting O
the O
gardener's O
, O
and O
under- O
gardener's O
children O
to O
school O
| | O
and O
by O
all O
the O
help O
you O
give O
them O
and O
every O
body O
else O
that O
works O
about O
the O
place O
, O
and O
I O
dearly O
love O
to O
see O
you O
do O
it O
, O
and O
I O
have O
no O
doubt O
in O
the O
world O
, O
that O
it O
keeps O
many O
from O
sending O
their O
children O
to O
the O
mills O
, O
and O
it O
will O
bring O
a O
blessing O
upon O
your O
head O
, O
my O
dear O
. O
But O
that's O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
poking O
yourself O
into O
such O
a O
place O
as O
you O
got O
into O
to O
- O
day O
. O
You O
never O
heard O
any O
thing O
so O
dreadful O
as O
what O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
was O
telling O
me O
about O
them O
, O
before O
you O
came O
out O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
. O
" O
Mary S-PERSON
shuddered O
, O
as O
she O
heard O
his O
name O
. O
" O
You O
will O
promise O
me O
dear O
, O
won't O
you O
, O
never O
to O
go O
to O
such O
a O
horrid O
place O
again O
, O
" O
resumed O
the O
old O
woman O
. O
" O
We O
will O
not O
talk O
about O
that O
now O
, O
my O
dear O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
, O
I O
want O
you O
to O
tell O
me O
what O
you O
think O
I O
could O
do O
that O
would O
be O
most O
useful O
for O
those O
poor O
young O
girls O
. O
I O
know O
what O
it O
is O
to O
lose O
a O
mother O
, O
dear O
nurse O
, O

it O
makes O
me O

God O

your O
kind O
heart O

my O
dear O

That O
is O
just O
like O
you O
, O

I O
wish O
with O
all O
my O
heart O

soul O

that O
you O
lived O
somewhere O
among O
the O
farming O
people O
, O
for O
there O
you O
would O
have O
some O
reward O
for O
your O
charity O
. O
But O
God O
help O
me O
! O
If O
one B-CARDINAL
half E-CARDINAL
of O
what O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
told O
me O
is O
true O
, O
these O
horrid O
girls O
are O
worse O
than O
it O
is O
decent O
to O
tell O
you O
, O
and O
the O
father's O
as O
bad O
. O
" O
" O
But O
don't O
you O
think O
my O
good O
friend O
, O
considering O
that O
I O
am O
more O
than O
come O
to O
years O
of O
discretion O
, O
and O
that O
you O
are O
a O
good O
deal O
older O
still O

don't O
you O
think O
it O
might O
be O
as O
well O
for O
us O
, O
in O
a O
case O
of O
such O
importance O

this O

to O
see O
and O
judge O
for O
ourselves O
, O
instead O
of O
taking O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling's E-PERSON
word O
for O
it O
? O
" O
said O
the O
heiress O
, O
while O
a O
slight O
frown O
contracted O
her O
brow O
. O
" O
Why O
yes O
, O
Miss O
Mary S-PERSON
— O
only O
it O
is O
so O
difficult O
to O
come O
at O
the O
truth O
, O
" O
replied O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
. O
" O
Surely O
there O
is O
one S-CARDINAL
truth O
that O
it O
is O
easy O
enough O
to O
come O
at O
— O
I O
suppose O
you O
have O
no O
doubt O
upon O
your O
mind O
that O
these O
people O
are O
in O
dreadful O
distress O
? O
" O
" O
Wicked O
people O
almost O
always O
are O
, O
Miss O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
" O
amend O
, O
or O
prevent O
their O
wickedness O
. O
It O
would O
be O
a O
frightful O
sin O
— O
worse O
in O
me O
, O
burdened O
as O
I O
feel O
myself O
with O
riches O
earned O
by O
the O
labour O
of O
such O
miserable O
little O
creatures O
as O
those O
whom O
we O
saw O
to O
- O
day O
— O
if O
I O
should O
look O
upon O
such O
utter O
destitution O
, O
let O
it O
be O
mixed O
up O
with O
what O
frailty O
it O
may O
, O
and O
pass O
along O
on O
the O
other O
side O
. O
I O
will O
not O
do O
it O
, O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
, O
so O
never O
ask O
it O
more O
. O
At O
present O
all O
I O
know O
is O
, O
that O
I O
have O
seen O
misery O
. O
Its O
cause O
I O
have O
yet O
to O
learn O
— O
This O
may O
be O
the O
work O
of O
time O
, O
and O
I O
do O
not O
mean O
to O
wait O
till O
I O
have O
acquired O
such O
knowledge O
before O
I O
relieve O
the O
want O
and O
woe O
I O
have O
witnessed O
. O
I O
left O
word O
that O
the O
eldest O
girl O
was O
to O
come O
up O
to O
me O
. O
She O
will O
hardly O
delay O
doing O
so O
, O
poor O
creature O
, O
therefore O
I O
must O
again O
postpone O
my O
intended O
visit O
to O
Hoxley B-FAC
- I-FAC
lane E-FAC
, O
for O
I O
will O
not O
go O
out O
to O
- O
morrow O
till O
I O
have O
seen O
her O
. O
" O
All O
this O
was O
very O
contrary O
to O
Mrs. O
Tremlett's S-PERSON
judgment O
, O
for O
she O
had O
a O
very O
natural O
dread O
lest O
the O
warm O
heart O
of O
her O
young O
charge O
, O
should O
be O
imposed O
upon O
by O
the O
designing O
and O
depraved O
. O
Nevertheless O
there O
was O
a O
feeling O
of O
respect O
that O
came O
upon O
her O
involuntarily O
, O
and O
as O
it O
were O
unawares O
, O
as O
she O
listened O
to O
the O
firmly O
- O
spoken O
purpose O
of O
the O
young O
girl O
whom O
as O
yet O
she O
could O
hardly O
persuade O
herself O
was O
more O
than O
a O
child O
. O
In O
pursuance O
of O
the O
resolution O
thus O
declared O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
did O
not O
stir O
from O
home O
during O
the O
whole O
of O
the O
following O
day O

one S-CARDINAL

two S-CARDINAL

distant O
neighbours O
called O
, O
but O
she O
was O
denied O
to O
them O
all O

from O
the O
fear O
that O
her O
anticipated O
interview O
with O
Sophy B-PERSON
Drake E-PERSON
, O
might O
be O
interrupted O

But O
the O
precaution O
was O
unnecessary O

the O
long O
morning O
wore O
away O
without O
the O
girl's O
making O
her O
appearance O

it O
was O
not O
till O
past O
eight B-TIME
o'clock I-TIME
in I-TIME
the I-TIME
evening E-TIME

that O
a O
servant O
entered O
the O
drawing O

room O

informed O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
that O
a O
very O
dirty O
girl O
and O
two S-CARDINAL
little O
children O
were O
at O
the O
gate O

The O
man O
retired O
in O
silence O

paid O
himself O
for O
his O
forbearance O
by O
the O
vehemence O
of O
his O
wondering O
commentary O
in O
the O
servants' O
hall O

Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton E-PERSON

sitting O
at O
an O

with O
the O
last O
light O

evening O
falling O
upon O
her O

the O
volume O
she O
held O
in O
her O
hand O

She O
had O
been O
making O
what O
proved O

an O
idle O
effort O
to O
read O

even O
when O
that O
light O
was O
stronger O

now O

the O
volume O
hung O
listlessly O
from O

her O
eyes O
, O
fixed O
on O
the O
brightly O
tinted O
vapours O
in O
the O
west O

seemed O
to O
look O
athwart O
them O

like O
the O
worthy O
gentleman O
on O
the O
platform O
before O
Tilbury B-FAC

Mrs. O

with O
the O
happy O
indifference O
to O
the O
increasing O
twilight O
peculiar O
to O
the O
sisterhood O
of O
knitters O

continued O
at O
another O
window O
to O
manoeuvre O
her O
bright O
weapons O

vary O
the O
successive O
fronts O
of O
her O
phalanx O
with O
no O
louder O
note O
of O
command O

than O
was O
occasionally O
produced O
by O
the O
gentle O
clicking O
of O
her O
needles O
against O

the O
footman O
left O
the O

Mary S-PERSON
turned O
towards O
her O

squalid O

the O

smote O
her O

languid O

along O
, O
than O
to O
indulge O
any O
feeling O
of O
curiosity O
. O
The O
little O
ones O
had O
the O
same O
unsteady O
tired O
gait O
, O
but O
they O
looked O
up O
with O
an O
expression O
of O
wonder O
, O
and O
almost O
of O
awe O
, O
on O
every O
object O
as O
they O
passed O
along O
. O
" O
" O
How O
are O
you O
all O
, O
my O
poor O
girls O

" O
said O
Mary S-PERSON
kindly O
, O
as O
they O
drew O
near O
to O
her O
. O
The O
eldest O
girl O
dropped O
a O
courtesy O
but O
made O
no O
audible O
reply O
. O
" O
It O
is O
so O
sad O
and O
hopeless O
a O
grief O
to O
lose O
a O
mother O
, O
" O
continued O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
, O
" O
that O
I O
can O
say O
not O
one O
word O
to O
check O
your O
grief O
. O
But O
if O
there O
is O
any O
thing O
that O
I O
can O
do O
to O
make O
you O
more O
comfortable O
, O
I O
shall O
be O
glad O
to O
do O
it O
. O
You O
seem O
all O
of O
you O
greatly O
in O
want O
of O
clothes O
. O
How O
comes O
that O
, O
when O
so O
many O
of O
the O
family O
work O
, O
and O
get O
wages O
? O
" O
" O
The O
wages O
isn't O
enough O
to O
buy O

replied O
the O
eldest O
girl O
, O
and O
help O
pay O
lodging O
rent O
. O
This O
statement O
seemed O
so O
very O
incredible O
, O
that O
Mary S-PERSON
felt O
a O
painful O
conviction O
that O
the O
young O
creature O
before O
her O
was O
not O
speaking O
truth O
. O
She O
remained O
silent O
for O
a B-TIME
minute E-TIME
or O
two S-CARDINAL
, O
and O
then O
said O
, O
" O
I O
suppose O
when O
you O

Mary S-PERSON

" O
I O

replied O
Sophy S-PERSON
colouring O
, O
and O
in O
a O
voice O
that O
seemed O
to O
indicate O
something O
like O
indignation O
— O
" O

" O
Mary S-PERSON
coloured O
too O
. O
She O
longed O
to O
get O
accurate O
information O
respecting O
their O
manner O
of O
living O
, O
and O
the O
reasons O
why O
incessant O
labour O
failed O
to O
supply O
the O
necessaries O
of O
life O

but O
she O
knew O
not O
well O
how O
to O
set O
about O
it O
. O
" O
Do O
not O
be O
angry O
with O
me O
, O
Sophy S-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
" O
if O
I O
ask O
questions O

unfeeling O

very O

really O

nothing O

I O
want O

from O

replied O
the O
girl O
, O
while O
tears O
started O
to O
her O
eyes O

" O
Father O
has O

her O

unhappy O
drunkenness O

the O

his O

into O
a O
degree O

nothing O

however O

that O
the O

her O
promises O

and O
turning O
to O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
, O
asked O
her O
in O
a O
half O
whisper O
what O
she O
could O
give O
them O

that O
might O

" O

might O
give O
them O
that O
piece O
of O
dark O
cotton O

my O
dear O

that O
you O
bought O
the O
other O

children O

There O
is O
no O
great O

" O
" O
Very O
true O

— O
It O
is O
just O
the O
thing O

" O
replied O
Mary S-PERSON

and O
having O
rung O
the O
bell O

ordered O
her O
maid O

she O
gave O
orders O

" O
I O

enough O

for O
one S-CARDINAL

I O
will O

next O
I O

Ashleigh S-PERSON

Sophy S-PERSON
took O
it O
with O
a O
courtesy O

but O
having O
held O
it O
for O
a O
moment O
said O
, O
" O

ma'am O

" O
Please O

ma'am O

I O
never O

replied O
the O
girl O
, O
blushing O

More O
convinced O
than O
ever O
, O
that O
her O
first S-ORDINAL
effort O
to O
assist O
the O
poor O

had O
led O
her O
by O
an O
unlucky O
chance O
into O
a O
family O
, O
whose O
unthrifty O
habits O
made O
it O
almost O
hopeless O
to O
attempt O
doing O
them O
any O
essential O
service O

Mary S-PERSON
drew O
forth O
her O
purse O
, O
and O
giving O
half O
- O
a- O
crown O
to O
each O
of O
them O
, O
took O
the O
useless O
material O
back O
, O
saying O
, O
" O
I O
will O
send O
you O
some O
more O
decent O
clothes O

then O
we O
must O

further O

be O
done O
for O
you O

these O
poor O
little O
ones O

But O
, O
indeed O
, O
my O
dear O
girl O
, O
I O
greatly O
fear O
that O

your O
habits O
are O
improved O

that O
you O
can O
be O
taught O

use O
your O

all O
other O
decent O
young O
women O
, O
in O
making O

mending O
what O
is O

it O
will O
be O
impossible O

do O
you O
much O

Poor O
Sophy S-PERSON
Drake S-PERSON
looked O
both O
sorry O

ashamed O

she O
listened O
to O
this O
reproof O

she O
attempted O
not O

answer O
it O

again O
courtesying O

she O
received O
the O
money O

she O
turned O
away O
without O

left O

you O

came O

I O
always O
heard O

you O
know O

my O

Mary S-PERSON

she O
listened O
to O

harassed O

puzzled O

replaced O

" O
Mr. O
Cantabury S-PERSON
expressed O
his O
gratitude O
and O
departed O

whereupon O
Martha S-PERSON
was O
again O
summoned O
to O
the O
presence O
of O
her O
father O
. O
" O
What O
a O
capital O
good O
girl O
you O
are O
, O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
the O
knight O
, O
affectionately O
patting O
her O
cheek O
, O
" O
always O
up O
and O
about O
before O
any O

out O

I O
tell O
you O
what O
, O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
you O

I O
will O
have O
our O
breakfast O
comfortably O
together O
without O
waiting O
for O
any O

I O
will O
walk O
down O
with O
you O
myself O
to O
see O
Michael's S-PERSON
mother O
, O
and O
settle O
with O
her O
about O
the O
little O
fellow's O
destination O
. O
" O
she O
sally O
forth O
, O
when O
the O
cheerful O
meal O
was O
ended O
, O
for O
the O
rare O
pleasure O
of O
a O
tête O
- O
à O
- O
tête O
walk O
with O
the O
great O
man O
. O
Nothing O
could O
exceed O
Sir O
Matthew's S-PERSON
good O
humour O
, O
he O
chatted O
, O
and O
joked O
, O
and O
talked O
of O
taking O
them O
all O
on O
a O
trip O
to O
Paris S-GPE
, O
and O
in O
short O
was O
hardly O
silent O
for O
a O
single O
moment O
. O
But O
amidst O
all O
this O
communicative O
confidential O
gossip O
, O
he O
never O
said O
a O
word O
more O
concerning O
the O
business O
they O
were O
upon O
. O
Once O
or O
twice O
Martha S-PERSON
began O
to O
say O
something O
intended O
to O
preface O
an O
inquiry O
as O
to O
the O
local O
destination O
of O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
but O
some O
lively O
sally O
from O
her O
father O
always O
turned O
the O
conversation O
into O
another O
channel O
, O
till O
at O
length O
they O
entered O
the O
gloomy O
region O
of O
Hoxley B-FAC
- I-FAC
lane E-FAC
| | O
after O
which O
, O
neither O
of O
them O
spoke O
again O
till O
Martha S-PERSON
said O
— O
" O
This O
is O
the O
house O
, O
papa O
. O
— O
But O
I O
believe O
we O
had O
better O
go O
in O
the O
back O
way O
. O
Shall O
I O
step O
in O
first S-ORDINAL
and O
say O
that O
you O
are O
coming O
? O
" O
" O
No O
, O
no O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
there O
is O
no O
occasion O
to O
be O
so O
ceremonious O
, O
we O
will O
go O
in O
together O
. O
" O
Martha S-PERSON
then O
lifted O
the O
latch O
, O
and O
they O
did O
go O
in O
together O
, O
causing O
the O
sick O
woman O
to O
start O
as O
if O
she O
had O
seen O
a O
spectre O
. O
It O
was O
nearly B-DATE
three I-DATE
years E-DATE
since O
Mrs. O
Armstrong S-PERSON
had O
last O
found O
herself O
in O
the O
overpowering O
presence O
of O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
| | O
and O
the O
belief O
that O
this O
visit O
was O
for O
the O
express O
purpose O
of O
receiving O
her O
thanks O
, O
increased O
the O
embarrassment O
so O
startling O
a O
condescension O
was O
calculated O
to O
produce O
. O
Martha S-PERSON
saw O
her O
colour O
change O
from O
pale O
to O
red O
, O
and O
then O
to O
pale O
again O
, O
and O
gently O
approaching O
her O
, O
said O
, O
" O
Mrs. O
Armstrong S-PERSON
, O
my O
father O

himself O
to O
talk O
with O
you O
about O
little O
Michael S-PERSON
. O
" O
" O
It O
is O
very O
— O
condescending O
, O
miss O
, O
" O
murmured O
the O
poor O
woman O
, O
" O
and O
I'm O
very O
grateful O
for O
this O
, O
and O
all O
favours O

" O
" O
Very O
good O
, O
very O
good O
, O
" O
said O
the O
knight O
, O
in O
return O
— O
not O
, O
however O
, O
looking O
very O
steadily O
in O
her O
face O
. O
" O
This O
young O
lady O
, O
who O
I O
suppose O
you O
know O
is O
Miss O
Martha B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
, O
my O
daughter O
, O
paid O
you O
a O
visit O
yesterday S-DATE
, O
I O
believe O
, O
and O
spoke O
to O
you O
, O
did O
she O
not O
, O
about O
your O
little O
boy O
? O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
sir O
, O
" O
was O
the O
concise O
reply O
. O
" O
And O
you O
approved O
, O
she O
tells O
me O
, O
of O
his O
being O

to O
a O
good O
trade O

" O
" O
In O
course O
, O
sir O
, O
I O
can't O
but O
approve O
, O
and O
be O
thankful O
for O
his O
being O
put O
in O
the O
way O
to O
help O
himself O
, O
and O
his O
poor O
crippled O
brother O
, O
too O
, O
when O
I O
am O
gone O
— O
but O
— O
I O
hope O
no O
offence O
, O
sir O
, O
I'd O
be O
right O
glad O
to O
know O
your O
honour's O
pleasure O
as O
to O
the O
place O
where O
he O
is O

" O
" O
And O
that O
is O
a O
little O
more O
than O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
, O
my O
good O
woman O
, O
" O
replied O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
friendly O
familiar O
tone O
. O
" O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
where O
his O
master O
that O
is O
to O
be O
, O
lives O
. O
That O
, O
" O
he O
continued O
, O
drawing O
the O
indentures O
out O
of O
his O
pocket O
, O
" O
that O
we O
shall O
find O
written O
down O
here O
— O
But O
he O
is O
one O
of O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
in O
his O
line O
, O
and O
a O
capital O
trade O
it O
is O
, O
I O
promise O
you O
, O
so O
that O
he O
has O
got O
work O
- O
shops O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
in O
half B-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
a I-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
dozen E-CARDINAL
places O
. O
However O
, O
I'll S-PERSON
make O
it O
my O
business O
to O
learn O
whereabouts O
Michael S-PERSON
is O
to O
be O
, O
and O
let O
you O
know O
. O
" O
As O
he O
said O
this O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
opened O
the O
instrument O
and O
busied O
himself O
in O
unscrewing O
the O
top O
of O
his O
neat O
little O
portable O
ink O
- O
bottle O
. O
" O
Then O
if O
it O
is O
all O
the O
same O
to O
you O
sir O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
widow O
Armstrong S-PERSON
, O
in O
rather O
an O
unsteady O
voice O
, O
" O
I O
should O
like O
well O
to O
know O
where O
it O
would O
be O
, O
before O
I O
put O
my O
hand O
to O
the O
binding O
him O
. O
" O
Martha S-PERSON
looked O
up O
, O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
half E-CARDINAL
afraid O
that O
such O
cautious O
acceptance O
of O
the O
important O
service O
offered O
, O
might O
offend O
her O
hot O
- O
tempered O
father O
| | O
but O
equally O
to O
her O
surprise O
and O
satisfaction O
she O
perceived O
that O
his O
countenance O
instead O
of O
expressing O
any O
thing O
of O
the O
kind O
, O
wore O
a O
look O
of O
more O
than O
usual O
good O
- O
humour O
, O
as O
he O
replied O
, O
beginning O
at O
the O
same O
time O
to O
replace O
the O
red O
tape O
round O
the O
papers O
. O
" O
That O
shall O
be O
just O
as O
it O
pleases O
you O
, O
my O
good O
woman O
, O
we O
won't O
say O
any O
thing O
more O
about O
it O
, O
just O
yet O
. O
" O
Then O
turning O
to O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
he O
said O
, O
in O
a O
sort O
of O
half S-CARDINAL
- O
whisper O
. O
" O
I O
can't O
stay O
now O
, O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
we O
must O
go O
, O
dear O
, O
because O
I O
expect O
to O
find O
some O
one O
waiting O
for O
me O
at O
home O
. O
But O
we O
must O
not O
deceive O
the O
poor O
dear O
woman O
either O
. O
She O
ought O
to O
know O
, O
Martha S-PERSON
that O
this O
is O
a O
chance O
I O
may O
not O
have O
again O
, O
God O
knows O
when O
, O
if O
ever O
. O
Can't O
you O
explain O
to O
her O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
that O
this O
is O
a O
sort O
of O
thing O
that O
by O
no O
means O
happens O
every O
day O
. O
Sometime O
ago O
I O
had O
an O
opportunity O
of O
doing O
this O
gentleman O
a O
good O
turn O
about O
one O
of O
his O
principal O
hands O
for O
whom O
he O
was O
greatly O
interested O
— O
for O
he O
is O
like O
a O
father O
to O
them O
all O
, O
and O
he O
promised O
then O
to O
return O
it O
whenever O
I O
had O
any O
thing O
of O
the O
same O
sort O
at O
heart O
. O
So O
now O
, O
I O
have O
written O
to O
him O
about O
this O
boy O
, O
and O
he O
has O
answered O
me O
as O
kind O
as O
possible O
| | O
only O
he O
tells O
me O
that O
he O
has O
got O
such O
quantities O
of O
applications O
from O
the O
people O
round O
him O
, O
that O
when O
he O
has O
a O
vacancy O
among O
the O
bound O
hands O
, O
he O
can't O
keep O
it O
open O
, O
and O
that O
he O
must O
have O
yes O
or O
no O
at O
once O
. O
I O
am O
afraid O
, O
therefore O
, O
that O
we O
must O
give O
it O
up O
, O
my O
dear O
. O
" O
This O
was O
" O
soft O
soder O
, O
" O
as O
the O
inimitable O
Slick S-PERSON
calls O
it O
| | O
and O
the O
poor O
doubting O
, O
trembling O
, O
helpless O
bit O
of O
human O
nature O
, O
lying O
on O
the O
bed O
from O
whence O
she O
knew O
full O
well O
she O
should O
never O
rise O
, O
did O
not O
listen O
to O
it O
unmoved O
. O
She O
felt O
, O
as O
he O
intended O
she O
should O
, O
her O
heavy O
responsibility O
, O
and O
looked O
up O
into O
the O
face O
of O
Martha S-PERSON
in O
a O
manner O
that O
very O
speakingly O
asked O
for O
counsel O
. O
The O
good O
girl O
understood O
the O
appeal O
, O
and O
frankly O
answered O
it O
. O
" O
You O
hear O
what O
my O
father O
says O
, O
Mrs. O
Armstrong S-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
leaning O
over O
the O
poor O
invalid O
. O
" O
Yes O
, O
miss O
, O
I O
do O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
anxious O
woman O
, O
" O
and O
, O
God O
help O
me O
! O
— O
I O
feel O
as O
weak O
and O
ignorant O
as O
a O
baby O
about O
what O
I O
ought O
to O
say O
in O
return O
. O
" O
" O
I O
don't O
know O
how O
that O
can O
be O
, O
" O
said O
the O
innocent O
Martha S-PERSON
a O
little O
reproachfully O
. O
" O
You O
know O
exactly O
how O
the O
case O
stands O
, O
and O
must O
certainly O
be O
able O
to O
judge O
what O
you O
think O
it O
right O
to O
do O
under O
these O
circumstances O
. O
" O
" O
I O
hope O
excuse O
, O
miss O
, O
if O
I O
seem O
over O
mothersome O
and O
foolish O
about O
him O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
poor O
widow O
in O
a O
deprecating O
tone O
, O
" O
but O
he's O
a O
precious O
boy O
to O
me O
, O
and O
the O
binding O
him O
, O
comes O
upon O
me O
unawares O
like O
. O
" O
likely O
she O
would O
be O
unhappy O
if O
we O
persuaded O
her O
, O
let O
it O
turn O
out O
as O
it O
would O
. O
" O
Instead O
of O
answering O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
suddenly O
wheeled O
round O
, O
and O
looked O
out O
of O
the O
window O
, O
as O
if O
the O
bit O
of O
stony O
mould O
extending O
ten B-QUANTITY
feet E-QUANTITY
deep O
to O
the O
ditch O
that O
fenced O
it O
, O
contained O
something O
of O
peculiar O
interest O
and O
curiosity O
. O
During O
this O
interval O
, O
which O
lasted O
about B-TIME
a I-TIME
minute E-TIME
, O
the O
widow O
Armstrong S-PERSON
again O
fixed O
her O
eyes O
upon O
the O
face O
of O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
with O
an O
appealing O
look O
that O
seemed O
to O
implore O
assistance O
from O
her O
judgment O
, O
while O
it O
evidently O
expressed O
confidence O
in O
her O
kindness O
. O
When O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
again O
permitted O
his O
countenance O
to O
be O
visible O
to O
them O
, O
it O
expressed O
nothing O
but O
indifference O
| | O
but O
Martha S-PERSON
thought O
it O
was O
such O
an O
easy O
good O
- O
natured O
sort O
of O
indifference O
that O
there O
could O
be O
no O
danger O
in O
bringing O
him O
back O
to O
the O
subject O
, O
even O
though O
he O
said O
as O
he O
turned O
round O
, O
" O
Come O
, O
my O
dear O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
I O
cannot O
stay O
another O
moment O
, O
I O
do O
assure O
you O
. O
" O
" O
I O
am O
quite O
ready O
, O
papa O
, O
" O
she O
replied O
| | O
" O
but O
don't O
you O
think O
it O
is O
almost O
a O
pity O
to O
let O
such O
an O
opportunity O
be O
lost O
for O
poor O
Michael S-PERSON
? O
" O
" O
Certainly O
it O
is O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
" O
he O
replied O
in O
the O
most O
good O
- O
humoured O
accent O
imaginable O
. O
" O
But O
what O
would O
you O
have O
me O
do O
, O
my O
dear O
child O
? O
Depend O
upon O
it O
there O
is O
no O
real O
charity O
in O
assisting O
people O
against O
their O
will O
, O
or O
in O
a O
manner O
in O
any O
way O
contrary O
to O
their O
inclinations O
. O
You O
know O
perfectly O
well O
, O
that O
it O
was O
my O
real O
and O
sincere O
wish O
that O
this O
good O
woman's O
child O
should O
be O
well O
provided O
for O
. O
An O
opportunity O
for O
doing O
this O
, O
better O
far O
than O
I O
could O
have O
hoped O
for O
, O
is O
now O
proposed O
but O
evidently O
does O
not O
meet O
her O
wishes O
. O
Unfortunately O
I O
must O
send O
the O
answer O
by O
to O
- O
day's O
post O
, O
and O
surely O
you O
would O
not O
recommend O
me O
to O
accept O
this O
situation O
for O
the O
boy O
, O
excellent O
as O
it O
is O
, O
against O
his O
mother's O
will O
? O
" O
" O
No O
papa O
— O
only O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
Mrs. O
Armstrong S-PERSON
has O
not O
quite O
made O
up O
her O
mind O
about O
it O
| | O
and O
I O
thought O
perhaps O
that O
a O
few O
minutes' O
consideration O
might O
enable O
her O
to O
perceive O
how O
great O
a O
loss O
it O
would O
be O
to O
Michael S-PERSON
were O
she O
to O
refuse O
it O
. O
" O
" O
Well O
, O
Martha S-PERSON
! O
" O
returned O
the O
knight O
with O
a O
sort O
of O
jocose O
sigh O
, O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
seating O
himself O
on O
one O
of O
the O
widow's O
treasured O
rush O

bottomed O
chairs O

would O
rather O

Dowling B-FAC

an O
hour O

either O

does O
the O
little O
fellow O
himself O
say O
about O
it O

grateful O

thankful O

sir O

for O
what O
is O

my O
poor O
weak O

it O

she O
added O
, O
turning O
her O
anxious O
eyes O
upon O
Martha S-PERSON
. O
For O
a O
moment O
Martha S-PERSON
felt O
a O
repugnance O
to O
the O
taking O
upon O
herself O
, O
as O
it O
were O
, O
the O
responsibility O
of O
the O
transaction O
, O
but O
an O
exclamation O
from O
her O
father O
settled O
the O
business O
at O
once O
. O
" O
Poor O
soul O
! O
" O
said O
he O
. O
" O
How O
natural O
is O
this O
weakness O
! O

her O

by O
your O
advice O

the O
strength O

it O

the O
most O
valuable O
gift O
you O
can O
bestow O

I O
am O
sure O
I O

full O
well O
all O

done O
for O
him O

been O
to O
him O
, O
and O
to O
doubt O
your O
judgment O

would O
be O
a O
sin O
indeed O

" O
Had O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
wanted O
any O
strengthening O
of O
the O
motives O
which O
actuated O
the O
deed O
he O
was O
about O
to O
perpetrate O
, O
he O
would O
have O
found O
it O
in O
this O
speech O

The O
phrase O
, O
" O
I O
know O
what O
you O
have O
been O
to O
him O
, O
" O
requiring O
no O
very O
forced O
interpretation O
, O
in O
order O
to O
suggest O
to O
him O
that O
it O
was O
probable O
she O
knew O
what O
he O
had O
been O
to O
him O
also O

However O
, O
he O
felt O
no O
inclination O
to O
disturb O
the O
business O
which O
was O
proceeding O
so O
satisfactorily O
, O
and O
therefore O
again O
smiled O
very O
kindly O
as O
he O
said O
, O
" O
I O
am O
sure O
nobody O
can O
find O
fault O

your O
conduct O

this O
business O

Mrs. O
Armstrong S-PERSON

It O
has O
been O
exactly O
what O
it O
ought O
to O

the O
better O
I O
think O
of O
you O

more O
anxious O
I O

this O
excellent O
situation O
for O
your O

But O
stay O
a O
moment O

I O
came O
down O
here O
in O
such O
a O
hurry O
, O
that O
I O
forgot O
the O
necessity O
of O
having O
a O
witness O

Wait O
here O
for O
a O
moment O

I O
dare O
say O

shall O
find O
some O
of O
Mrs. O
Armstrong's S-PERSON
neighbours O
who O
may O
not O
only O
be O
able O
to O
witness O
these O
indentures O

also O
to O
give O
her O
their O
opinion O
upon O
the O
advantage O
of O
them O
. O
" O
So O
saying O
the O
knight O
arose O
, O
and O
walked O
out O
of O
the O
room O

but O
, O
before O
an O
anxious O
inquiry O
from O
the O
poor O
woman O
about O
the O
possibility O
of O
writing O
to O
her O
boy O
could O
be O
answered O
by O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
he O
returned O
again O
, O
followed O
by O
Parsons S-PERSON
and O
another O
overlooker O
from O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
his O
own O
factories O
, O
whom O
he O
found O
accidentally O
close O
to O
the O
premises O
. O
" O
Here O
is O
a O
bit O
of O
good O
luck O
for O
us O

Martha S-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
as O
he O
entered O
, O
" O
I O
should O
have O
been O
sadly O
put O
to O
it O
for O
time O

I O
had O
had O
to O
run O
about O

I O
could O
find O
a O
man O
who O
knew O
how O
to O
write O
his O
name O

I O
have O
asked O
two S-CARDINAL
fellows O
already O
, O
but O
they O
both O
said O
, O
' O
No O
. O
' O
— O
There O
is O
one S-CARDINAL
comfort O
for O
you O

at O
any O
rate O
, O
Mrs. O
Armstrong S-PERSON

your O
boy O
will O
never O

in O
such O
a O
state O
of O
ignorance O
as O
that O

" O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
as O
he O
spoke O
, O
again O
untied O
the O
paper O

dipping O
a O
pen O
which O
had O
been O
stuck O
within O
his O
coat O
sleeve O
into O
the O
ink O
- O
bottle O
, O
he O
gave O
both O
pen O
and O
paper O
into O
the O
hands O
of O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
saying O
, O
" O
There O
dear O
, O
you O
will O
hold O
it O
for O
her O
better O
than O
I O
shall O
— O
only O
make O
haste O
! O
— O
I O
hate O
to O
break O
an O
appointment O

" O
Martha S-PERSON
received O
the O
paper O
, O
and O
without O
a O
moment's O
delay O
, O
laid O
it O
before O
the O
pale O
and O
trembling O
woman O
, O
placing O
at O
the O
same O
time O
the O
pen O
in O
her O
right O
hand O
, O
and O
indicating O
with O
her O
own O
finger O
the O
place O
, O
to O
which O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
had O
pointed O
, O
as O
that O
where O
her O
signature O
should O
be O
. O
The O
poor O
woman O
received O
both O
submissively O

and O
after O
a O
moment's O
pause O
, O
looked O
up O
once O
more O
into O
the O
face O
of O
Martha S-PERSON
who O
was O
bending O
over O
her O
. O
A O
kind O
and O
encouraging O
smile O
sat O
upon O
her O
plain O
but O
expressive O
features O
, O
and O
without O
further O
hesitation O
, O
the O
widow O
Armstrong S-PERSON
signed O
her O
name O
. O
" O
Here O
Parsons S-PERSON
, O
sign O
away O
! O
" O
said O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
gaily O
, O
as O
he O
withdrew O
the O
document O
from O
the O
bed O
. O
The O
ready O
servant O
obeyed O
, O
and O
his O
fellow O
- O
driver O
followed O
his O
example O
, O
without O
waiting O
for O
any O
further O
instructions O
. O
" O
Now O
then O
, O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
let O
us O
be O
off O
! O
" O
cried O
the O
knight O
, O
moving O
towards O
the O
door O
as O
he O
pocketed O
the O
papers O
. O
But O
stopping O
suddenly O
before O
he O
opened O
it O
he O
said O
, O
" O
By O
the O
way O
, O
Parsons S-PERSON
, O
as O
chance O
has O
brought O
you O
here O
, O
we O
may O
as O
well O
make O
use O
of O
you O
about O
getting O
a O
few O
necessaries O
for O
our O
little O
stocking O
- O
weaver O
. O
We O
must O
trust O
to O
you O
to O
get O
whatever O
may O
be O
wanted O
. O
He O
may O
take O
the O
clothes O
he O
has O
worn O
at O
the O
lodge O
, O
for O
Sundays S-DATE
, O
but O
of O
course O
they O
would O
not O
be O
suitable O
for O
him O
to O
work O
in O
. O
" O
" O
Very O
well O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
I O
will O
see O
about O
it O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
important O
overlooker O
. O
" O
I O
must O
have O
no O
time O
lost O
, O
if O
you O
please O
, O
" O
rejoined O
his O
master O
rather O
sharply O
| | O
" O
for O
Mr. O
Elgood B-PERSON
Sharpton E-PERSON
mentioned O
in O
his O
letter O
, O
that O
he O
should O
be O
having O
some O
of O
his O
people O
passing O
this O
way O
who O
might O
take O
charge O
of O
him O
, O
and O
I O
am O
sure O
I O
can't O
say O
when O
they O
may O
happen O
to O
call O
. O
So O
go O
directly O
into O
the O
town O
, O
Parsons S-PERSON
, O
and O
buy O
whatever O
you O
think O
the O
boy O
may O
want O
. O
I O
dare O
say O
this O
will O
be O
very O
nearly O
the O
last O
expense O
, O
Mrs. O
Armstrong S-PERSON
, O
" O
he O
added O
, O
" O
that O
I O
shall O
be O
put O
to O
for O
him O
, O
and O
I O
assure O
you O
that O
I O
shall O
pay O
it O
very O
willingly O
. O
" O
With O
these O
words O
he O
left O
the O
room O
, O
and O
martha O
pronouncing O
a O
short O
but O
kind O
farewell O
, O
followed O
him O
. O
Soon O
after O
she O
had O
overtaken O
him O
, O
and O
again O
passed O
her O
arm O
through O
his O
, O
she O

As O
soon O
as O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
and O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
had O
finished O
their O
breakfast O
on O
the B-TIME
morning E-TIME
after O
the O
interview O
with O
Sophy B-PERSON
Drake E-PERSON
in O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
at O
Milford B-FAC
Park E-FAC
, O
they O
set O
off O
together O
on O
foot O
to O
visit O
the O
widow O
Armstrong S-PERSON
in O
Hoxley B-FAC
- I-FAC
lane E-FAC
. O
carriage O
was O
more O
terrible O
than O
any O
thing O
likely O
to O
befall O
us O
on O
the O
high O
- O
road O
without O
one O

" O
" O
Why O
, O
I O
suppose O
I O
must O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
" O
answered O
the O
old O
lady O
| | O
" O
for O
to O
tell O
you O
the O
truth O
, O
I O
don't O
think O
you O
could O
look O
more O
put O
out O
if O
a O
constable O
were O
to O
come O
up O
and O
arrest O
you O

" O
Decidedly O
not O

Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON

and O
listen O
to O
the O
birds O
, O
and O
sniff O
the O
sweet O
air O
, O
and O
then O
tell O
me O
if O
we O
are O
not O
wise O
to O
walk O
? O
" O
The O
old O
woman O
confessed O
that O
she O
really O
did O
enjoy O
it O
, O
and O
on O
they O
went O
with O
the O
gardener's O
boy O
for O
a O
guide O
, O
till O
in O
less B-TIME
than I-TIME
an I-TIME
hour E-TIME
they O
found O
themselves O
before O
the O
door O
of O
No. O
12 S-CARDINAL
, O
in O
Hoxley B-FAC
- I-FAC
lane E-FAC

Probably O
their O
little O
pioneer O
was O
not O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
widow's O
visiters O
, O
for O
the O
pass O
through O
the O
hedge O
, O
leading O
to O
the O
back O

kitchen O

unknown O

knock O
for O
admittance O
, O
the O
principal O
entrance O
to O
No. O
12 S-CARDINAL
was O
opened O
by O
the O
ragged O
mistress O
of O
the O
tenement O
. O
" O
Does O
the O
widow O
Armstrong S-PERSON
live O
here O
? O
" O
inquired O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
" O
Yes O
, O
ma'am O
, O
" O
observed O
the O
woman O
gloomily O
| | O
continuing O
as O
she O
made O
way O
for O
the O
ladies O
to O
enter O
, O
" O
The O
widow O
Armstrong S-PERSON
is O
a O
lucky O
woman O
— O
she O
has O
got O
but O
one S-CARDINAL
child O
left O
to O
provide O
for O
, O
and O
yet O
the O
gentlefolks O
keeps O
coming O
to O
help O
her O
, O
but O
nobody O
thinks O
of O
me O
and O
my O
ten S-CARDINAL
young O
ones O
. O
" O
The O
ready O
hand O
of O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
was O
immediately O
in O
her O
purse O
. O
" O
That O
is O
a O
large O
family O
indeed O
, O
my O
good O
woman O
. O
Are O
they O
none O
of O
them O
old O
enough O
to O
help O
themselves O
? O
" O
" O
The O
seven S-CARDINAL
oldest O
have O
all O
been O
in O
the O
factory O
from O
a'most O
the O
time O
they O
could O
stand O
, O
ma'am O
, O
" O
replied O
Mrs. O
Sykes S-PERSON
, O
" O
and O
if O
they O
hadn't O
, O
they O
must O
have O
been O
dead O
and O
buried O
long O
ago O
for O
want O
of O
bread O
. O
But O
though O
they O
have O
worked O
poor O
creturs O
, O
early O
and O
late O
, O
there's O
no O
more O
come O
of O
it O
, O
than O
that O
their O
bones O
be O
here O
instead O
of O
in O
the O
churchyard O
. O
" O
" O
But O
with O
so O
large O
a O
number O
, O
all O
receiving O
wages O
, O
" O
said O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
, O
gently O
, O
" O
I O
should O
have O
hoped O
that O
you O
might O
have O
found O
yourselves O
better O
off O
than O
you O
seem O
to O
be O
. O
" O
" O
And O
that's O
what O
we O
are O
told O
, O
ma'am O
, O
from O
year's O
end O
to O
year's O
end O
, O
and O
we O
must O
bear O
it O
, O
for O
there O
is O
no O
help O
. O
But O
' O
tis O
a'most O
as O
bitter O
as O
the O
work O
that O
grinds O
us O
. O
" O
her O
, O
and O
till O
she O
had O
spoken O
the O
words O
given O
above O
, O
a O
deep O
feeling O
of O
the O
woman's O
unworthiness O
chilled O
the O
ready O
pity O
of O
her O
warm O
young O
heart O
. O
But O
both O
in O
these O
words O
themselves O
, O
and O
in O
the O
tone O
of O
quiet O
settled O
despair O
in O
which O
they O
were O
spoken O
, O
there O
was O
a O
frightful O
and O
mysterious O
allusion O
to O
some O
species O
of O
injustice O
and O
cruelty O
, O
under O
which O
accusation O
she O
seemed O
herself O
to O
be O
included O
. O
The O
distaste O
and O
reprobation O
that O
were O
a O
moment O
before O
making O
hasty O
inroads O
upon O
her O
benevolence O
, O
seemed O
suddenly O
arrested O
as O
she O
listened O
| | O
and O
she O
was O
about O
to O
repeat O
again O
the O
questions O
she O
had O
already O
so O
uselessly O
asked O
, O
as O
to O
whence O
this O
universal O
severity O
of O
judgment O
against O
the O
factory O
labourers O
arose O
| | O
and O
wherefore O
, O
beyond O
all O
others O
, O
submitted O
to O
the O
sentence O
which O
dooms O
human O
beings O
to O
toil O
, O
these O
people O
should O
appear O
to O
loath O
their O
employment O
, O
and O
execrate O
, O
as O
it O
should O
seem O
, O
the O
very O
means O
by O
which O
they O
lived O
. O
But O
ere O
her O
lips O
opened O
to O
demand O
the O
explanation O
to O
which O
she O
so O
eagerly O
desired O
to O
listen O
, O
a O
glance O
at O
the O
hard O
features O
of O
the O
wretched O
woman O
checked O
her O
. O
" O
It O
cannot O
be O
from O
such O
as O
these O
, O
" O
thought O
she O
, O
" O
that O
truth O
and O
instruction O
can O
be O
reasonably O
looked O
for O
" O
— O
and O
as O
she O
silently O
gave O
her O
alms O
, O
and O
moved O
onwards O
towards O
the O
door O
which O
had O
been O
pointed O
to O
, O
as O
that O
of O
the O
widow O
Armstrong S-PERSON
, O
something O
like O
a O
systematic O
project O
for O
making O
herself O
mistress O
of O
the O
knowledge O
she O
wanted O
, O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
suggested O
itself O
to O
her O
imagination O
. O
Mrs. O
Sykes S-PERSON
eyed O
the O
silver O
largesse O
, O
as O
it O
fell O
into O
her O
hand O
, O
with O
a O
glance O
that O
seemed O
to O
devour O
it O
, O
and O
the O
words O
of O
thanks O
she O
uttered O
were O
almost O
hysterical O
in O
their O
eager O
vehemence O
. O
After O
delaying O
a O
moment O
for O
the O
contemplation O
of O
this O
precious O
" O
drudge O
' O
twixt O
man O
and O
man O
, O
" O
she O
opened O
the O
door O
of O
communication O
, O
and O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
and O
her O
friend O
passed O
into O
the O
dwelling O
- O
room O
of O
the O
widow O
Armstrong S-PERSON
. O
Contrary O
to O
custom O
, O
her O
lame O
boy O
, O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
was O
sitting O
on O
the O
side O
of O
her O
bed O
, O
and O
when O
Mary S-PERSON
entered O
, O
he O
was O
holding O
her O
hand O
, O
and O
gazing O
in O
her O
face O
with O
an O
expression O
of O
countenance O
which O
appeared O
to O
both O
the O
intruders O
to O
be O
the O
most O
piteous O
they O
had O
ever O
looked O
upon O
. O
The O
poor O
child O
was O
looking O
, O
too O
, O
most O
wretchedly O
ill O
, O
and O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
idea O
which O
suggested O
itself O
was O
, O
that O
he O
felt O
himself O
to O
be O
dying O
. O
Notwithstanding O
the O
extreme O
poverty O
of O
the O
widow O
Armstrong S-PERSON
, O
there O
was O
an O
air O
of O
decency O
and O
decorum O
about O
her O
, O
that O
might O
in O
any O
situation O
have O
commanded O
respect O
| | O
but O
when O
contrasted O
with O
the O
appearance O
of O
her O
neighbour O
, O
seemed O
to O
indicate O
a O
claim O
to O
more O
observance O
than O
her O
visiters O
were O
showing O
by O
this O
sudden O
and O
uninvited O
entrance O
. O
" O
I O
beg O
your O
pardon O
, O
Mrs. O
Armstrong S-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
gently O
, O
" O
for O
breaking O
in O
upon O
you O
so O
abruptly O
| | O
and O
I O
fear O
our O
doing O
so O
may O
have O
startled O
your O
sick O
child O
. O
— O
This O
little O
fellow O
is O
very O
ill O
, O
I O
fear O

" O
" O
It O
is O
long O
since O
he O
has O
known O
health O

ma'am O

" O
replied O
the O
widow O
| | O
" O
but O
it O
is O
not O
that O
which O
makes O
him O
look O
so O
white O
and O
trembling O
now O
. O
We O
have O
lost O
what O
was O
dearer O
to O
us O
both O
than O
all O
the O
world O
beside O
— O
and O
though O
I O
don't O
think O
as O
this O
one O
will O
ever O
look O
up O
again O
, O
I O
can't O
find O
a O
word O
in O
my O
heart O
to O
comfort O
him O
! O
" O
" O
What O
, O
then O
, O
has O
happened O
to O
you O
? O
" O
said O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
with O
much O
interest O
— O
" O
Nothing O
bad O
to O
your O
son O
Michael S-PERSON

I O
hope O

" O
" O
You O
know O
Michael S-PERSON

ma'am O

said O
the O
poor O
woman O
, O
anxiously O
. O
" O
I O
have O
seen O
him O
at O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling's E-PERSON
, O
" O
she O
replied O
. O
" O
I O
wish O
you O
never O
had O
, O
ma'am O
! O
" O
rejoined O
the O
widow O
, O
bitterly O
— O
" O
We O
were O
only O
starving O
before O
, O
but O
now O
we O
are O
worse O
than O
that O

" O
" O
Do O
explain O
to O
me O
what O
you O
mean O
, O
Mrs. O
Armstrong S-PERSON

said O
Mary S-PERSON

" O
I O
ought O
to O
do O
it O
, O
ma'am O
, O
for O
you O
speak O
kindly O

that's O
a O
claim O
poor O
folks O
can O
seldom O
withstand O

— O

how O
can O
I O
tell O
you O
the O
matter O
, O
ma'am O
? O
I O
know O
nothing O

that's O
the O
reason O
why O
poor O
Edward S-PERSON

I O
are O
so O
miserable O
. O
" O
" O
But O
that O
is O
a O
bad O
way O
to O
get O
into O
, O
my O
good O
Mrs. O
Armstrong S-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
cheerfully O
. O
" O
Don't O
fret O
yourself O
about O
fancied O
evils O

which O
perhaps O
do O
not O
exist O

Little O
Edward S-PERSON
here O
should O
know O
better O
than O
that O

" O
The O
pale O
, O
brokenhearted O
boy O
looked O
at O
her O
with O
lack O

lustre O
eyes O

said O
nothing O

" O
Are O
you O
uneasy O

down O

Miss O

" O

replied O
the O
widow O

with O
a O
sob O

that O
seemed O
the O
result O
of O
strength O
exhausted O

weakness O

struggle O
no O
longer O

changing O
colour O

another O

the O
words O

" O
Do O

" O
pursued O
Mary S-PERSON

bending O
over O
her O

" O

I O
entreat O
you O
to O
explain O
to O
me O
fully O
what O
you O

I O
am O
greatly O
interested O

your O

" O
I O
thank O
you O
for O
it O
, O
ma'am O

returned O
the O
poor O
mother O
, O
mournfully O

I O
can O
tell O
little O

you O

any O
grand O
lady O

the O
friend O
of O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON

would O
think O
to O
the O
purpose O

Yet O
the O
parting O
with O
him O
without O
one S-CARDINAL
blessing O
, O
or O
one S-CARDINAL
kiss O
, O
is O
hard O
to O
bear O

we O
don't O
justly O
know O
that O
any O

him O

I O
am O
no O
particular O
friend O
of O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling's E-PERSON
, O
" O
replied O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
with O
an O
accent O
which O
perhaps O
spoke O
more O
than O
her O
words O
. O
" O
Then O
I O
will O
tell O
you O
about O
Michael S-PERSON
! O
" O
exclaimed O
the O
lame O
boy O
, O
coming O
round O
the O
bed O
to O
the O
place O
where O
she O
was O
standing O
, O
and O
looking O
into O
her O
face O
as O
if O
he O
thought O
he O
could O
read O
all O
her O
thoughts O
there O
. O
" O
You O
have O
seen O
poor O
Mike S-PERSON

he O
was O
living O
there O

" O
" O
Yes O
, O
I O
have O
, O
my O
dear O
boy O
, O
" O
she O
replied O
, O
gazing O
with O
deep O
feeling O
at O
his O
pale O
, O
but O
beautiful O
countenance O

" O
I O
have O
seen O
him O
there O
more O
than O
once O
, O
Edward S-PERSON

I O
am O
quite O
sure O
he O
was O
not O
happy O
, O
though O
he O
was O
dressed O
so O
fine O
. O
" O
" O
He O
was O
more O
unhappy O
ten S-CARDINAL
times O
over O
, O
" O
replied O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
" O
than O
when O
he O
was O
as O
ragged O
as O
me O
. O
" O
" O
Was O
he O
unkindly O
treated O
? O
" O
demanded O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
" O
He O
was O
beaten O
, O
kicked O
, O
and O
spit O
upon O
! O
" O
cried O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
bursting O
into O
tears O

" O
and O
then O
he O
was O
told O
to O
laugh O
, O
and O
look O
merry O
. O
" O
" O
A O
wretched O
, O
wretched O
, O
sort O
of O
cruelty O
! O
" O
she O
replied O
, O
" O
of O
which O
I O
can O
well O
believe O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
capable O
. O
But O
you O
surely O
do O
not O
suppose O
that O
he O
has O
run O
away O
from O
it O
without O
telling O
you O

his O
mother O

he O
had O
such O
an O
intention O

" O
" O
If O
you O
knew O
Mike S-PERSON

you O
wouldn't O

do O
such O
wickedness O

" O
said O
the O
mother O

" O

the O
mill O

day O

has O
been O
bruised O
almost O
to O
a O
jelly O

was O
always O
dearer O

a O
great O
deal O

to O
him O

himself O

cruel O
stripes O

poor O
shoulders O

too O

come O
home O
with O
his O
little O

washed O
with O
tears O
from O
it O

he O
didn't O
think O
of O
running O
away O

" O
Mary S-PERSON
saw O
that O
she O
had O
given O
pain O
, O
and O
hastened O
to O
atone O
for O
it O
by O
expressing O
her O
sorrow O
for O
supposing O
such O
a O
thing O
possible O

and O
then O
repeated O
her O
request O
, O
that O
she O
might O
be O
told O
what O
it O
was O
that O
had O
happened O
. O
The O
widow O
then O
related O
more O
succinctly O
than O
might O
have O
been O
expected O
, O
all O
that O
had O
passed O
between O
herself O

her O
boy O

Miss O
Martha B-PERSON

on O
the O
morning O
which O
followed O
the O
theatrical O
representation O
at O
Dowling B-FAC
Lodge E-FAC
. O
And O
before O
she O
proceeded O
further O
, O
Edward S-PERSON
bore O
testimony O
to O
the O
spirited O
and O
courageous O
willingness O
with O
which O
his O
brother O
had O
adopted O
the O
proposed O
scheme O

He O
had O
, O
it O
seemed O
, O
as O
usual O
, O
watched O
Teddy's S-PERSON
return O
from O
the O
factory O
— O
told O
him O
what O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
proposed O
doing O
for O
him O
, O
and O
declared O
, O
that O
hard O
as O
it O
would O
be O
to O
part O
with O
him O
and O
" O
mother O
, O
" O
he O
was O
ready O
and O
willing O
to O
start O
, O

was O
quite O
determined O
to O
be O
the O
best O
boy O
that O
ever O
was O
' O
prenticed O
, O

to O
be O
workman O
enough O
to O
maintain O
them O
both O
as O
soon O
as O
his O
time O
was O
out O
. O
Here O
the O
widow O
again O
resumed O
her O
narrative O
, O
and O
related O
very O
accurately O
the O
scene O
of O
the O
following O
morning O

dwelling O
much O
on O
the O
young O
lady's O
kind O
manner O
, O
and O
on O
her O
own O
putting O
it O
to O
her O
whether O
she O
advised O
that O
the O
child O
should O
go O
, O

not O
. O

Martha B-PERSON

you O

" O

again O
, O

did O
, O

the O
poor O
mother O

" O

are O
quite O
sure O
it O

" O
Oh O
, O
yes O
! O
ma'am O

my O
Mike S-PERSON

care O
to O
make O
me O
understand O
that O
, O
the O
day O
they O
came O
together O
. O
" O
" O
Then O
be O
quite O
easy O
in O
your O
mind O
, O
Mrs. O
Armstrong S-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
eagerly O
. O
" O
I O
have O
no O
great O
liking O
for O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
. O
I O
do O
not O
think O
well O
of O
him O
, O
nor O
have O
I O
much O
to O
say O
in O
favour O
of O
any O
of O
his O
family O
. O
They O
seem O
to O
me O
to O
be O
cold O
- O
hearted O
, O
selfish O
people O
. O
But O
for O
this O
one O
, O
this O
Miss O
Martha S-PERSON
that O
you O
speak O
of O
, O
I O
will O
undertake O
to O
answer O
for O
it O
that O
she O
has O
never O
deceived O
you O
, O
and O
that O
if O
she O
advised O
you O
to O
let O
Michael S-PERSON
go O
, O
it O
was O
because O
she O
thought O
the O
doing O
so O
would O
be O
advantageous O
for O
him O
. O
" O
truth O
, O
ma'am O
, O
in O
your O
voice O
, O
and O
in O
your O
eyes O
. O
Do O
as O
I O
do O
, O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
dear O
! O
look O
at O
the O
kind O
face O
of O
this O
young O
lady O
, O
and O
see O
if O
you O
can't O
find O
comfort O
from O
what O
she O
says O
? O
I O
did O
think O
, O
myself O
, O
ignorant O
as O
I O
am O
, O
that O
the O
young O
lady O
had O
an O
honest O
face O
. O
But O
, O
oh O
! O
ma'am O
, O
let O
it O
be O
as O
it O
will O
, O
and O
make O
the O
very O
best O
of O
it O
, O
' O
tis O
cruel O
to O
have O
our O
darling O
taken O
away O
in O
this O
fashion O
, O
without O
one S-CARDINAL
word O
of O
take O
- O
leave O
and O
blessing O
! O
" O
" O
Indeed O
it O
is O
! O
" O
replied O
Mary S-PERSON
| | O
" O
and O
your O
being O
ignorant O
of O
the O
place O
of O
his O
destination O
increases O
this O
anxiety O
. O
But O
on O
this O
point O
, O
at O
least O
, O
I O
think O
I O
shall O
be O
able O
to O
set O
your O
mind O
at O
rest O

Before O
this O
time O
to O
- O
morrow O

I O
will O
take O
care O
to O
see O
some O
part O
of O
the O
family O
at O
the O
Lodge S-ORG

and O
shall O
certainly O
not O
scruple O
to O
inquire O
every O
particular O
respecting O
your O
boy O

Keep O
up O
your O
spirits O

, O
both O
of O
you O

for O
the O

let O
this O
little O
fellow O
here O
look O
to O
me O
for O
his O
wages O

I O
won't O

him O

" O
Astonishment O
very O
literally O
rendered O
the O
widow O
Armstrong S-PERSON
dumb O
, O
on O
hearing O
this O
most O
extraordinary O
proposal O

Poor O
soul O
! O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
short I-DATE

would O
have O
been O
sufficient O
to O
make O
her O
forget O
her O
weakness O

her O
want O

have O
put O
her O
in O
a O
state O
of O
mind O
that O

envy O

for O

now O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
use O

made O
on O
recovering O
her O
speech O

was O
to O
exclaim O

hear O
it O

Mrs. O
Armstrong S-PERSON

said O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
voice O
of O
such O
cheerful O
confidence O
, O
that O
the O
terrors O
of O
both O
mother O

seemed O
to O
vanish O
before O
it O

Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
, O
too O
, O
ventured O
to O
add O
an O
encouraging O
commentary O
upon O
Mary's S-PERSON
promised O
visit O
of O
inquiry O
at O
the O
Lodge S-ORG

observing O

that O
it O
was O
altogether O
out O

want O
to O
make O
any O
mystery O

to O

the O
little O
fellow O
was O
gone O

Mrs. O
Armstrong S-PERSON
, O
as O
she O
listened O

seemed O
almost O
too O
happy O
to O
credit O
the O
evidence O
of O
her O
own O
senses O

but O
in O
the O
deep O
- O
set O
melancholy O
eye O
of O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
there O
was O
still O
an O
expression O
of O
suffering O
and O
of O
fear O
that O
looked O
as O
if O
misery O
had O
taken O
a O
hold O
upon O
him O

could O
not O

relinquished O

" O
Now O
I O

" O
child O

could O
not O

his O
whole O
frame O

shedding O
tears O

" O
God O

me O
again O

so O

she O
took O
the O
arm O
of O
her O
friend O

again O
passed O
through O

creturs O
. O
" O
Miss O
Brotherton's S-PERSON
heart O
was O
too O
full O
to O
answer O
— O
she O
nodded O
her O
head O
and O
passed O
on O
. O
Their O
homeward O
walk O
, O
up O
Hoxley B-FAC
- I-FAC
lane E-FAC
, O
across O
the O
London S-GPE
road O
, O
and O
along O
a O
pretty O
shaded O
bridle O
- O
road O
that O
led O
to O
a O
gate O
in O
her O
own O
park O
- O
paling O
, O
was O
performed O
almost O
entirely O
in O
silence O
. O
There O
is O
a O
state O
of O
mind O
in O
which O
ideas O
come O
with O
too O
much O
violence O
and O
rapidity O
to O
be O
told O
off O
in O
words O
. O
When O
this O
happens O
from O
an O
excess O
of O
happy O
imaginings O
, O
no O
condition O
can O
be O
more O
delightful O
: O
but O
when O
, O
as O
in O
the O
present O
case O
, O
it O
arises O
from O
the O
remembrance O
of O
painful O
realities O
, O
it O
is O
greatly O
the O
reverse O
. O
The O
misery O
around O
her O
was O
no O
longer O
a O
matter O
of O
doubtful O
speculation O
, O
but O
of O
most O
frightful O
certainty O
. O
Neither O
was O
it O
any O
vice O
in O
little O
Edward B-PERSON
Armstrong E-PERSON
, O
which O
drove O
him O
to O
offer O
up O
his O
sickly O
suffering O
frame O
to O
ceaseless O
labour O
at O
the O
rate O
of O
threepence O
for O
each O
long O
, O
painful O
day O
. O
She O
felt O
oppressed O
, O
overwhelmed O
, O
and O
almost O
hopeless O
. O
Yet O
at O
that O
time O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton E-PERSON
knew O
not O
, O
guessed O
not O
, O
dreamed O
not O
, O
of O
the O
hundredth O
part O
of O
what O
the O
unhappy O
class O
who O
had O
thus O
roused O
her O
human O
sympathies O
, O
were O
daily S-DATE
and O
hourly O
suffering O
around O
her O
. O
The O
first S-ORDINAL
words O
she O
spoke O
on O
entering O
her O
house O
were O
to O
order O
her O
carriage O
, O
and O
having O
gone O
so O
far O
in O
the O
performance O
of O
the O
task O
she O
had O
undertaken O
, O
she O
turned O
with O
tender O
kindness O
to O
her O
old O
friend O
, O
and O
gave O
as O
much O
care O
to O
her O
comfort O
and O
refreshment O
, O
as O
if O
the O
relative O
situation O
which O
they O
had O
borne O
to O
each O
other O
in O
days O
of O
yore O

nothing O

what O
point O
of O
the O
earth's O
surface O
Michael B-PERSON
Armstrong E-PERSON
might O
be O
found O
. O
She O
inquired O
for O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
and O
was O
shown O
as O
usual O
into O
my O
lady's O
morning O
drawing O
- O
room O
, O
where O
to O
her O
extreme O
annoyance O
she O
found O
her O
ladyship O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
Lady O
Clarissa B-PERSON
Shrimpton E-PERSON
, O
and O
Miss O
Mogg. S-PERSON
of O
unquestionable O
notoriety O
to O
the O
whole O
neighbourhood O

But O
if O
his O
reception O
was O
cold O
, O
that O
of O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa E-PERSON
was O
warm O
, O
for O
she O
actually O
threw O
her O
arms O
round O
the O
young O
lady O
, O
reproaching O
her O
at O
the O
same O
time O
very O
tenderly O
for O
not O

sent O
to O

was O
going O

" O
I O
should O
have O
liked O
your O

my O

so O
much O
better O
than O
my O
broiling O
little O

" O
It O
was O
hardly O
possible O
at O
that O
moment O
, O
that O
either O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
four S-CARDINAL
persons O
present O
could O
have O
said O
any O
thing O
to O
her O
sufficiently O
interesting O
to O
fully O
awaken O
her O
sense O
of O
hearing O

unless O
, O
indeed O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
had O
led O
the O
conversation O
to O
Michael B-PERSON
Armstrong E-PERSON

But O
this O
he O
did O
not O
do O

, O
therefore O
, O
having O
endured O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa's E-PERSON
embrace O

and O
answered O
her O
mechanically O
, O
she O
knew O
not O
what O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
walked O
up O
to O
the O
sofa O
where O
the O
lady O
of O
the O
mansion O
as O
usual O
sat O
enthroned O
, O
and O
said O
, O
" O
Will O
you O
be O
so O
good O
, O
ma'am O
, O
as O
to O
let O
Miss O
Martha S-PERSON
be O
told O
that O
I O
am O
come O
to O
call O
upon O
her O
? O
" O
The O
surprised O
eyebrows O
with O
which O
her O
ladyship O
listened O
to O
this O
speech O
would O
, O
probably O
, O
under O
other O
circumstances O
, O
have O
given O
birth O
to O
an O
exceedingly O
comical O
caricature O
, O
but O
at O
this O
moment O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton E-PERSON
had O
no O
fun O
in O
her O
thoughts O
, O
and O
not O
immediately O
receiving O
an O
answer O
, O
she O
said O
, O
loud O
enough O
for O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
to O
hear O
, O
" O
Will O
you O
give O
me O
leave O
to O
ring O
the O
bell O
, O
and O
ask O
for O
the O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
Miss O
Martha S-PERSON
? O
" O
Lady O
Dowling S-PERSON
still O
remained O
silently O
staring O
at O
her O
| | O
but O
not O
so O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
. O
He O
reached O
the O
bell O
almost O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
young O
lady O
herself O
, O
and O
fully O
persuaded O
that O
this O
most O
unaccountable O
request O
could O
only O
proceed O
from O
some O
little O
manoeuvring O
project O
at O
that O
moment O
labouring O
in O
the O
fair O
Brotherton's S-PERSON
head O
, O
which O
had O
, O
somehow O
or O
other O
, O
his O
son O
Augustus S-PERSON
for O
its O
object O
, O
his O
countenance O
resumed O
all O
its O
former O
affectionate O
urbanity O
towards O
her O
, O
and O
taking O
her O
hand O
too O
suddenly O
for O
any O
contrivance O
to O
prevent O
it O
, O
he O
said O
— O
" O
Martha S-PERSON
? O
... O
Do O
you O
want O
to O
see O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
my O
dear O
? O
— O
To O
be O
sure O
you O
shall O
. O
She O
is O
a O
Dowling S-PERSON
, O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
, O
though O
not O
quite O
like O
the O
rest O
of O
us O
. O
But O
where O
is O
the O
Dowling S-PERSON
, O
young O
or O
old O
, O
male O
or O
female O
, O
who O
would O
not O
fly O
from O
the O
farthest O
corner O
of O
the O
world O
to O
see O
you O
? O
" O
" O
I O
only O
want O
to O
see O
Miss O
Martha S-PERSON
just O
now O
, O
sir O
, O
" O
replied O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
half O
smiling O
. O
" O
And O
Martha S-PERSON
you O
shall O
see O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
without O
a O
moment's O
delay O
. O
Desire O
Miss O
Martha B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
to O
come O
here O
instantly O
! O
" O
he O
continued O
, O
as O
the O
door O
opened O
, O
and O
a O
servant O
appeared O
at O
it O
— O
adding O
, O
when O
the O
door O
closed O
again O
, O
" O
You O
do O
her O
an O
honour O
, O
my O
dear O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
, O
in O
thus O
asking O
for O
her O
, O
that O
more O
than O
one O
of O
her O
family O
, O
perhaps O
, O
might O
feel O
inclined O
to O
envy O
. O
" O
But O
as O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
made O
no O
answer O
at O
all O
, O
and O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa E-PERSON
began O
to O
hem O
, O
and O
fidget O
, O
and O
walk O
towards O
the O
window O
, O
all O
which O
the O
observant O
knight O
well O
knew O
were O
pretty O
lures O
, O
meant O
to O
recal O
him O
, O
he O
contented O
himself O
with O
gallantly O
drawing O
forward O
an O
arm O
- O
chair O
for O
the O
heiress O
, O
at O
no O
great O
distance O
from O
Lady B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
, O
and O
then O
strode O
across O
the O
apartment O
to O
sooth O
the O
irritation O
of O
his O
noble O
friend O
. O
unanswered O
. O
The O
message O
had O
been O
delivered O
to O
her O
in O
his O
name O
, O
and O
she O
entered O
almost O
immediately O
. O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
in O
no O
humour O
to O
make O
small O
talk O
for O
her O
ladyship O
, O
instantly O
rose O
, O
and O
went O
forward O
to O
meet O
her O
. O
" O
I O
took O
the O
liberty O
of O
sending O
for O
you O
, O
my O
dear O
Miss O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
" O
she O
said O
, O
" O
to O
request O
you O
would O
let O
me O
speak O
to O
you O
alone O
, O
for O
five B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
. O
— O
Will O
you O
take O
a O
parasol O
, O
and O
let O
us O
walk O
into O
the O
shrubbery O
together O
? O
" O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
who O
certainly O
liked O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
, O
notwithstanding O
the O
late O
painful O
scene O
, O
produced O
by O
her O
indiscretion O
, O
and O
who O
, O
moreover O
, O
at O
this O
moment O
, O
joyfully O
recollected O
how O
charming O
an O
anecdote O
she O
had O
now O
to O
relate O
concerning O
her O
father O
, O
acquiesced O
in O
this O
proposal O
with O
a O
ready O
smile O
, O
and O
saying O
that O
her O
parasol O
was O
always O
in O
the O
hall O
, O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
young O
ladies O
left O
the O
room O
together O
. O
No O
sooner O
did O
she O
find O
herself O
beneath O
the O
sheltering O
trees O
of O
the O
extensive O
shrubbery O
, O
and O
ascertained O
, O
by O
looking O
round O
, O
that O
they O
were O
really O
alone O
, O
than O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
, O
passing O
her O
arm O
through O
that O
of O
her O
companion O
, O
said O
, O
" O
My O
dear O
Miss O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
I O
cannot O
help O
feeling O
great O
interest O
in O
the O
welfare O
of O
the O
little O
boy O
whom O
we O
saw O
performing O
the O
other O
night O
— O
little O
Michael B-PERSON
Armstrong E-PERSON
, O
I O
mean O
. O
Will O
you O
have O
the O
kindness O
to O
tell O
me O
where O
he O
is O
now O
? O
" O
Instead O
of O
giving O
a O
direct O
answer O
, O
Martha S-PERSON
eagerly O
exclaimed O
, O
" O
I O
am O
so O
glad O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
, O
that O
you O
asked O
to O
see O
me O
, O
for O
I O
have O
quite O
longed O
to O
tell O
you O
all O
particulars O
about O
that O
little O
fellow O
— O
and O
all O
that O
papa O
has O
been O
doing O
for O
him O
. O
I O
do O
assure O
you O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
, O
that O
notwithstanding O
what O
you O
saw O
the O
other O
night O
, O
papa O
has O
been O
, O
and O
still O
is O
, O
most O
excessively O
kind O
to O
him O
. O
Only O
he O
was O
very O
troublesome O
about O
the O
acting O
, O
and O
papa's O
temper O
is O
hasty O
. O
That O
, O
as O
you O
must O
be O
aware O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
, O
is O
the O
case O
with O
many O
people O
| | O
but O
there O
are O
very O
few O
who O
have O
courage O
and O
candour O
to O
own O
it O
, O
as O
my O
father O
does O
. O
In O
justice O
to O
him O
, O
I O
must O
tell O
you O
what O
happened O
the O
morning O
after O
the O
unfortunate O
play O
. O
My O
father O
sent O
for O
me O
, O
and O
said O
, O
that O
he O
was O
perfectly O
miserable O
in O
his O
mind O
on O
account O
of O
the O
anger O
he O
had O
shown O
towards O
Michael S-PERSON
. O
He O
told O
me O
, O
as O
frankly O
as O
possible O
, O
that O
he O
had O
beat O
him O
, O
and O
that O
in O
consequence O
of O
this O
, O
the O
boy O
was O
evidently O
so O
afraid O
of O
him O
that O
he O
had O
no O
enjoyment O
when O
in O
his O
presence O
. O
And O
he O
went O
on O
to O
say O
that O
such O
being O
the O
case O
, O
he O
was O
determined O
to O
apprentice O
the O
child O
to O
a O
good O
trade O
, O
where O
he O
might O
learn O
to O
maintain O
himself O
comfortably O
, O
and O
assist O
his O
family O
besides O
. O
So O

, O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON

" O
concluded O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
in O
an O
eager O
voice O
, O
and O
with O
heightened O
colour O
, O
" O
you O
see O
that O
if O
papa O
loses O
his O
temper O
, O
he O
knows O
how O
to O
atone O
for O
it O
. O
" O
little O
fellow O
. O
And O
now O
I O
hope O
you O
will O
tell O
me O
also O
to O
what O
part O
of O
the O
country O
he O
has O
been O
sent O
. O
" O
" O
I O
would O
tell O
you O
in O
a O
moment O
, O
if O
I O
knew O
, O
my O
dear O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
, O
but O
I O
do O
not O
. O
His O
departure O
at O
last O
was O
very O
sudden O

owing O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
to O
papa's O
having O
found O
some O
particularly O
good O
opportunity O
of O
sending O
him O
. O
" O
" O
I O
wonder O
you O
should O
never O
have O
asked O
where O
he O
was O
sent O
to O
, O
Miss O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
gravely O
. O
" O
I O
did O
ask O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
, O
" O
replied O
Martha S-PERSON
| | O
" O
but O
papa O
said O
he O
could O
not O
recollect O
the O
name O
of O
the O
place O
. O
" O
Mary S-PERSON
changed O
colour O
, O
as O
she O
remembered O
the O
promise O
she O
had O
given O
to O
the O
child's O
mother O

but O
after O
a O
moment's O
reflection O
, O
said O
, O
" O
Perhaps O
he O
may O
have O
recollected O
it O
, O
since O
, O
my O
dear O
— O
I O
wish O
you O
would O
run O
in O
, O
and O
ask O
him O
to O
come O
to O
me O
for O
a O
moment O
. O
" O
Martha S-PERSON
seemed O
to O
hesitate O
. O
" O
I O
am O
sure O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
after O
a O
little O
hesitation O
, O
" O
that O
papa O
would O
be O
delighted O
to O
come O
here O
to O
talk O
with O
you O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
— O
only O
Lady O
Clarissa S-PERSON
might O
— O
" O
" O
Nay O
, O
then O
, O
I'll O
go O
to O
him O
myself O

" O
said O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
rather O
abruptly O
. O
" O
There O
is O
no O
particular O
objection O

I O
suppose O
, O
to O
Lady O
Clarissa's S-PERSON
being O
let O
into O
the O
secret O
of O
little O
Michael's S-PERSON
abode O
. O
" O
And O
immediately O
turning O
her O
steps O
towards O
the O
house O
, O
she O
re-entered O
the O
drawing O

room O
, O
followed O
by O
Martha S-PERSON
. O
They O
found O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
engaged O
in O
exhibiting O
a O
portfolio O
of O
splendid O
engravings O
to O
her O
ladyship O
, O
who O
was O
descanting O
upon O
them O
with O
rapture O

though O
the O
application O
of O
a O
near O

sighted O
glass O

one O
long O
- O
sighted O
eye O

while O
the O

was O
effectually O
closed O

rendered O
them O
pretty O
nearly O
invisible O
to O
her O

" O
I O
beg O
ten B-CARDINAL
thousand E-CARDINAL
pardons O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
the O
heiress O
, O
placing O
herself O
at O
the O
opposite O
side O
of O
the O
loo O

table O
, O
and O
thereby O
commanding O
a O
perfect O
view O
of O
his O
countenance O

" O
but O
you O
are O
too O
goodnatured O
, O
I O
am O
sure O
, O
to O
be O
angry O

I O
do O

you O

the O
kindness O

Lady O

lost O
in O
admiration O

enchanting O
Venus S-PERSON

where O
little O
Michael B-PERSON
Armstrong E-PERSON

" O
The O
question O
was O
too O
unexpected O
for O
even O
Sir O
Matthew's S-PERSON
sturdy O
self O
- O
possession O
, O
to O
receive O
it O
as O
he O
would O
have O
wished O

His O
bold O
eye O

which O
had O
been O
gaily O
fixed O
on O
the O
young O
lady O
, O
as O
she O
spoke O
to O
him O
, O
fell O
before O
her O
keen O
, O
inquiring O
glance O
, O
and O
he O
turned O
the O
page O
of O
Lady O
Clarissa's S-PERSON
adoration O
with O
rather O
unseemly O
rapidity O

The O

superseded O
all O

shrewdly O
inquired O

Fair O

softly O

Mr. O

a O
when O

where O
in O

get O
the O
boy O
off O

you O

I O
between O

There O
is O
no O

I O
have O
more O

" O
The O
party O
, O
as O
arranged O
by O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON

consisted O
of O
himself O
, O
his O
friend O
Dr. O
Crockley S-PERSON
, O
and O
Michael B-PERSON
Armstrong E-PERSON
. O
The O
little O
fellow O
had O
been O
repeatedly O
honoured O
by O
a O
seat O
in O
the O

stately O
vehicle O
before O

for O
the O
purpose O
of O
being O
shown O
off O
at O
various O
houses O
in O
the O
neighbourhood O
, O
and O
had O
a O
notion O
that O
he O
was O
now O
taken O
out O
, O
in O
order O
to O
hear O
the O
remainder O

great O
fortune O
announced O

That O
this O
final O
proof O
of O
Sir O

benevolence O
should O
have O
for O
its O
object O
the O
sending O
him O
far O
away O
from O
Dowling B-FAC
Lodge E-FAC
would O
have O
been O
, O
but O
for O
the O
dreaded O
parting O
with O
his O
mother O
and O
brother O
, O
a O
source O
of O
unmixed O
joy O
to O
the O
little O
apprentice O

and O
, O
even O
with O
this O
drawback O
, O
the O
distant O
hopes O
of O
his O
young O
heart O
might O
have O
been O
read O
in O
the O
contented O
meditation O
of O
his O
eye O
, O
as O
he O
rode O
silently O
along O
in O
front O
of O
his O
jocose O
companions O
, O
who O
amused O
themselves O
the O
while O
in O
talking O
very O
mystically O
concerning O
him O
, O
and O
his O
very O
useful O
and O
judicious O
destination O
. O
At O
length O
the O
carriage O
reached O
the O
point O
at O
which O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
intended O
his O
airing O
should O
terminate O
, O
and O
he O
looked O
out O
to O
reconnoitre O
the O
opening O
of O
a O
lane O
to O
the O
left O
where O
he O
expected O
to O
see O
the O
covered O
cart O
. O
Nor O
was O
he O
disappointed O

a O
covered O
cart O
, O
with O
an O
excellent O
stout O
horse O
in O
it O
, O
was O
drawn O
up O
close O
to O
the O
bank O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O
the O
shade O
of O
a O
thick O
elm O
- O
tree O
that O
grew O
upon O
it O
. O
As O
the O
carriage O
approached O
, O
the O
occupant O
of O
the O
humbler O
vehicle O
peeped O
out O
, O
and O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
recognised O
the O
punctual O
Parsons S-PERSON
. O
" O
Pull O
the O
check O
- O
string O
, O
Crockley S-PERSON

" O
said O
the O
knight O
, O
" O
We O
will O
get O
out O
here O

That O
is O

you O
may O

you O
will O

there O

" O
" O
Oh O
! O
dear O
no O

replied O
Dr. O
Crockley S-PERSON
, O
cheerfully O
. O
" O
Here O
comes O
Parsons S-PERSON
, O
good O
man O

true O

Get O
out O

Jump O
, O
jump O
, O
and O
enjoy O
it O
, O
my O
fine O
fellow O
! O
Perhaps O
you O
won't O
have O
much O
time O
for O
jumping O
when O
you O
begin O
learning O
your O
trade O

" O
Without O
thinking O
it O
needful O
to O
reply O
to O
what O
he O
did O
not O
very O
clearly O
understand O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
did O
as O
he O
was O
bid O
, O
and O
sprang O
from O
the O
carriage O
to O
the O
ground O
. O
The O
well O
- O
known O
figure O
of O
Parsons S-PERSON
greeted O
him O
as O
his O
feet O
touched O
the O
turf O
, O
and O
the O
next O
instant O
he O
felt O
his O
hand O
suddenly O
seized O
by O
him O
. O
" O
Shall O
you O
want O
me O
, O
Mr. O
Parsons S-PERSON
? O
" O
said O
Dr. O
Crockley S-PERSON
, O
putting O
his O
head O
out O
of O
the O
carriage O
. O
" O
Not O
at O
all O
, O
sir O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
superintendent O
, O
leading O
Michael S-PERSON
forward O
. O
" O
Then O
shut O
the O
carriage O
- O
door O
, O
John S-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
" O

order O
the O
coachman O
to O
drive O
home O
. O
" O
" O
Please O
sir O
! O
Please O
sir O
! O
— O
" O
uttered O
the O
plaintive O
voice O
of O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
as O
he O
turned O
his O
head O
, O
and O
attempted O
to O
disengage O
his O
hand O
. O
" O
Please O
sir O
, O
is O
Mr. O
Parsons S-PERSON
to O
take O
me O
away O
? O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
my O
boy O
, O
he O
is O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
knight O
, O
loud O
enough O
for O
the O
footman O
to O
hear O
. O
" O
He O
is O
going O
to O
take O
you O

your O

may O
give O
my O
compliments O

tell O

— O
Good O
bye O
! O

Home O

So O
ended O
the O
colloquy O

the O
carriage O
turned O
round O
and O
drove O
off O
by O
the O
way O
it O
came O
, O
and O
Michael B-PERSON
Armstrong E-PERSON
was O
left O
alone O
with O
Mr. O
Joseph B-PERSON
Parsons E-PERSON

He O
need O
not O
, O
however O
, O
have O
held O
the O
little O
fellow's O
hand O
so O
tight O
, O
for O
there O
was O
no O
rebellion O
in O
his O
heart O
, O
nor O
any O
thought O
of O
escape O
in O
his O
head O
. O
He O
knew O
his O
companion O
too O
well O
to O
hope O
for O
any O
explanation O
from O
him O
respecting O
this O
sudden O
manner O
of O
sending O
him O
off O
, O
and O
child O
as O
he O
was O
, O
he O
had O
no O
inclination O
to O
weep O
before O
him O
| | O
but O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
his O
young O
heart O
swelled O
with O
a O
proud O
determination O
to O
behave O
well O
, O
and O
to O
set O
about O
his O
new O
employment O
with O
a O
stout O
spirit O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
when O
he O
arrived O
at O
the O
cart O
he O
paused O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
before O
he O
obeyed O
the O
orders O
of O
Parsons S-PERSON
to O
" O
climb O
up O
, O
" O
and O
ventured O
to O
say O
, O
" O
Please O
sir O
, O
beant O
I O
to O
see O
mother O
any O
more O
? O
" O
" O
Climb O
up O
! O
I O
tell O
you O
, O
" O
said O
the O
brute O
, O
clenching O
his O
fist O
at O
him O
, O
" O
and O
if O
you O
bother O
me O
with O
any O
more O
questions O
, O
I'll O
just O
give O
you O
this O
in O
your O
mouth O
to O
stop O
your O
jabbering O
. O
" O
more O
resolutely O
have O
screwed O
his O
spirit O
to O
endurance O
than O
he O
did O
as O
he O
now O
clambered O
up O
, O
and O
placed O
himself O
, O
as O
he O
was O
directed O
, O
in O
the O
back O
part O
of O
the O
vehicle O
, O
not O
another O
syllable O
passed O
his O
lips O
. O
For O
four B-TIME
hours E-TIME
the O
slow O
but O
sore O
- O
footed O
cart O
- O
horse O
, O
jogged O
on O
through O
a O
lane O
, O
that O
would O
have O
made O
any O
pace O
beyond O
a O
walk O
, O
intolerable O
. O
At O
the O
end O
of O
that O
time O
, O
the O
cart O
stopped O
before O
the O
door O
of O
a O
lonely O
public O
- O
house O
that O
formed O
a O
corner O
, O
round O
which O
the O
road O
turned O
off O
at O
nearly O
a O
right O
angle O
, O
and O
stretched O
across O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
those O
wild O
and O
desolate O
moors O
which O
are O
, O
perhaps O
, O
only O
to O
be O
found O
in O
such O
perfection O
of O
dark O

stoney O

he O

you O

it O

the O
old O

the O
way O

the O
receiving O

that O

to O

, O
the O
kitchen O

here O
, O
though O
the O
season O
was O
still O
warm O
elsewhere O
, O
a O
large O
fire O
was O
burning O
. O
That O
its O
warmth O
was O
welcome O
might O
be O
gathered O
from O
the O
fact O
, O
that O
the O
only O
persons O
in O
possession O
of O
the O
room O
were O
sitting O
or O
standing O
close O
beside O
it O
. O
The O
guests O
, O
before O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
new O
comers O
, O
amounted O
only O
to O
three S-CARDINAL

, O
a O
young O
woman O
pacing O
her O
way O
to O
a O
distant O
service O
, O
a O
stout O
lad O
, O
her O
brother O
, O
who O
travelled O
with O
her O
, O
to O
carry O
her O
box O
and O
guard O
her O
from O
harm O

and O
a O
venerable O
looking O
man O
with O
gray O
hair O
, O
but O
having O
withal O
bright O
eyes O
, O
and O
a O
florid O
skin O
, O
and O
bearing O
in O
his O
dress O
and O
demeanour O
, O
the O
appearance O
of O
a O
thriving O
agriculturist O
. O
It O
was O
with O
so O
bustling O
a O
movement O
, O
that O
the O
landlady O
pushed O
back O
the O
little O
round O
table O
on O
which O
stood O
the O
farmer's O
mug O
of O
beer O
, O
and O
there O
was O
so O
much O
of O
respect O
in O
the O
manner O
with O
which O
she O
wiped O
the O
chair O
brought O
forward O
for O
Mr. O
Parsons S-PERSON
, O
that O
the O
fact O
of O
his O
being O
a O
person O
of O
consequence O
, O
became O
notorious O
to O
all O
. O
The O
farmer O
quietly O
pushed O
back O
his O
chair O
, O
to O
follow O
the O
table O
, O
the O
young O
woman O
modestly O
squeezed O
herself O
very O
closely O
into O
the O
chimney O
- O
corner O
, O
and O
her O
brother O
fairly O
bolted O
, O
standing O
with O
eyes O
and O
mouth O
widely O
opened O
, O
to O
gaze O
at O
ease O
upon O
the O
distinguished O
society O
into O
which O
it O
had O
been O
his O
chance O
to O
fall O
. O
Mr. O
Parsons S-PERSON
took O
his O
place O
among O
them O
, O
as O
such O
a O
great O
man O
ought O
to O
do O
. O
That O
is O
to O
say O
, O
he O
looked O
neither O
to O
the O
right O
nor O
to O
the O
left O
, O
but O
made O
himself O
comfortable O
without O
taking O
the O
trouble O
of O
considering O
whether O
any O
other O
person O
were O
present O
, O
or O
not O
. O
Michael S-PERSON
crept O
in O
after O
him O
, O
and O
when O
the O
more O
important O
part O
of O
the O
company O
had O
arranged O
themselves O
, O
he O
was O
observed O
standing O
alone O
in O
the O
most O
distant O
part O
of O
the O
room O
. O
" O
What O
dost O
stand O
shivering O
there O
for O
, O
my O
boy O
? O
" O
said O
the O
old O
farmer O
, O
in O
north O
- O
country O
dialect O
, O
so O
broad O
as O
to O
be O
dangerous O
for O
south O
- O
country O
folks O
to O
spell O
, O
" O
I O
could O
be O
after O
thinking O
there O
was O
some O
mistake O
here O
. O
Surely O
you O
ought O
not O
to O
be O
standing O
, O
while O
some O
other O
folks O
are O
sitting O
. O
" O
This O
observation O
, O
though O
the O
genuine O
result O
of O
the O
old O
man's O
notions O
of O
vulgar O
, O
and O
the O
reverse O
, O
might O
not O
have O
been O
so O
bluntly O
spoken O
, O
had O
he O
not O
felt O
himself O
affronted O
by O
the O
unceremonious O
style O
in O
which O
his O
place O
before O
the O
fire O
had O
been O
taken O
from O
him O
. O
Michael S-PERSON
probably O
did O
not O
understand O
the O
full O
meaning O
of O
the O
remark O
, O
nevertheless O
he O
looked O
dreadfully O
terrified O
, O
and O
fixed O
his O
eyes O
upon O
the O
back O
part O
of O
Mr. O
Parson's S-PERSON
august O
head O
, O
his O
face O
being O
fortunately O
turned O
from O
him O
, O
with O
an O
expression O
of O
desperate O
fear O
, O
that O
seemed O
to O
puzzle O
the O
good O
farmer O
. O
" O
Well O
now O
, O
don't O
he O
look O
like O
as O
well O
- O
behaved O
and O
pretty O
a O
young O
gentleman O
as O
one O
would O
wish O
to O
see O
? O
" O
continued O
the O
farmer O
, O
turning O
to O
the O
young O
girl O
, O
" O
and O
yet O
there's O
no O
mistaking O
that O
t'other's O
his O
master O

" O
Fine O

birds O

for O
them O

cried O
Parsons S-PERSON
contemptuously O
, O
and O
turning O
one O
of O
his O
threatening O
scowls O
upon O
the O
old O
man O
. O
" O
But O
wait O
a O
bit O
, O
Goodman B-PERSON
Goose E-PERSON

you'll O
find O
out O
perhaps O

glitters O

" O
" O
Poor O
little O

the O
farmer O
, O
on O
meeting O
the O
superintendent's O
ill O

omened O
eye O

" O
Dame B-PERSON

said O
Parsons S-PERSON

without O
appearing O
to O
hear O
him O

Spite O
of O
his O
fine O
clothes O

which O
were O

a O
gift O

charity O

neither O
better O

worse O

" O
" O
I O
would O
not O

thought O
it O
! O

said O
the O
old O
man O
, O
apparently O
satisfied O
, O

turning O
to O
his O
mug O
. O
" O
No O

I O
dare O
say O

retorted O
Parsons S-PERSON

with O
a O
sneer O

" O
Such O
chaps O
as O
you O

seldom O

out O

" O
From O
this O
moment O
no O
further O
interest O
was O
expressed O
about O
little O
Michael S-PERSON

He O
was O
a O
factory O
boy O
, O
and O
what O
good O
was O
there O
in O
asking O
any O
further O
questions O
? O
So O
a O
thick O
slice O
of O
bread O
, O
and O
a O
scrap O
of O
bacon O
were O
set O
before O
him O

as O
soon O
as O
the O
more O
elaborate O
supper O
of O
Mr. O
Parsons S-PERSON
was O
concluded O
, O
he O
with O
great O
affability O
took O
the O
little O
fellow O
by O
the O
hand O

preceded O
by O

conducted O
him O
to O
a O
pallet O

the O

chamber O

For O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
moment O
after O
he O
was O
left O
alone O
with O
the O

the O

inclination O

him O
pay O

that O
the O

now O
that O
the O
peaceable O

convinced O
him O
that O
it O

felt O

Ere O

, O
his O

was O
just O
such O

desired O

that O
Mr. O

cautiously O
onward O
amidst O

looked O
out O

almost O
approached O

came O
also O

about O

good O

in O

hereafter O
he O
might O

money O
enough O
for O
himself O
, O
for O
mother O

Teddy S-PERSON
too O

Nevertheless O
, O
he O
certainly O
did O
wish O

at O

very O
bottom O

his O
heart O

that O
the O

he O

to O

Not O

you O
have O
had O
a O
bit O

drop O
with O

are O
at O
supper O
in O
the O
Prentice B-FAC

our O
young O
master O
shall O
be O
handed O
in O
at O
once O

" O
So O
saying O
, O
the O
scowling O
manager O
opened O
a O
door O
in O
the O
farther O
corner O
of O
the O
room O
, O
and O
made O
Michael S-PERSON
a O
sign O
that O
he O
was O
to O
pass O
through O
it O
. O
The O
child O
obeyed O
, O
but O
he O
trembled O
in O
every O
joint O
. O
Feelings O
of O
deeper O
terror O
than O
had O
ever O
reached O
his O
heart O
before O
, O
were O
creeping O
over O
him O
. O
His O
lips O
moved O
not O
, O
but O
his O
very O
soul O
seemed O
to O
whisper O
within O
him O
, O
" O
Mother O
! O
Mother O
! O
" O
Yet O
at O
that O
moment O
the O
unhappy O
boy O
knew O
not O
what O
was O
before O
him O
| | O
the O
influence O
under O
which O
he O
cowered O
thus O
, O
was O
like O
that O
produced O
by O
the O
leaden O
dimness O
of O
a O
coming O
storm O
upon O
the O
birds O
, O
who O
droop O
their O
pinions O
and O
seem O
ready O
to O
fall O
to O
the O
earth O
, O
even O
before O
a O
single O
hailstone O
has O
touched O
them O
. O
A O
long O
low O
passage O
led O
to O
another O
door O
, O
which O
was O
again O
opened O
by O
the O
condescending O
hand O
of O
Mr. O
Woodcomb S-PERSON
| | O
through O
this O
he O
thrust O
the O
poor O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
and O
having O
either O
by O
a O
word O
or O
a O
sign O
made O
known O
to O
the O
governor O
of O
the B-ORG
Prentice I-ORG
- I-ORG
house E-ORG
, O
that O
he O
had O
brought O
an O
accession O
to O
his O
wretched O
crew O
, O
he O
retired O
, O
closing O
the O
door O
behind O
him O
. O
Michael S-PERSON
heard O
the O
door O
close O
, O
and O
looked O
up O
. O
The O
room O
he O
was O
in O
was O
so O
long O
as O
almost O
to O
appear O
like O
a O
gallery O
, O
and O
from O
one S-CARDINAL
end O
to O
the O
other O
of O
it O
a O
narrow O
deal O
board O
stretched O
out O
, O
having O
room O
for O
about B-CARDINAL
two I-CARDINAL
hundred E-CARDINAL
to O
sit O
down O
at O
once O
. O
The O
whole O
of O
this O
table O
was O
now O
occupied O
by O
a O
portion O
of O
the O
apprentice O
children O
, O
both O
boys O
and O
girls O
, O
belonging O
to O
Deep B-ORG
Valley I-ORG
Mill E-ORG
, O
and O
their O
appearance O
might O
have O
wrung O
the O
heart O
of O
any O
being O
who O
looked O
upon O
them O
, O
however O
blessedly O
wide O
his O
own O
destiny O
might O
lead O
him O
from O
the O
melancholy O
troop O
. O
But O
to O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
the O
spectacle O
was O
appalling O
| | O
and O
, O
young O
as O
he O
was O
, O
he O
seemed O
to O
feel O
that O
the O
filthy O
, O
half S-CARDINAL
- O
starved O
wretches O
before O
him O
, O
were O
so O
many O
ghostly O
representations O
of O
what O
he O
was O
himself O
to O
be O
. O
A O
sickness O
like O
that O
of O
death O
came O
over O
him O
, O
and O
he O
would O
have O
given O
a O
limb O
, O
only O
for O
freedom O
to O
stretch O
himself O
down O
upon O
the O
floor O
and O
see O
no O
more O
. O
But O
the O
master O
of O
the O
ceremonies O
at O
this O
feast O
of O
misery O
bore O
a O
huge O
horsewhip O
in O
his O
hand O
, O
without O
which O
indeed O
, O
it O
is O
said O
, O
he O
seldom O
appeared O
on O
the O
premises O
, O
and O
with O
it O
an O
eye O
that O
seemed O
to O
have O
the O
power O
of O
quelling O
with O
a O
single O
glance O
, O
the O
will O
of O
every O
little O
wretch O
it O
looked O
upon O
. O
water O
- O
porridge O
, O
and O
a O
lump O
of O
oaten O
cake O
, O
of O
a O
flavour O
so O
sour O
and O
musty O
, O
that O
the O
little O
fellow O
, O
though O
never O
accustomed O
till O
the O
fatal O
patronage O
of O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
fell O
upon O
him O
, O
to O
any O
viands O
more O
dainty O
than O
dry O
bread O
, O
could O
not O
at O
this O
first S-ORDINAL

persuade O
himself O

a O

for O
him O
in O
every O
way O
, O
chanced O
to O
have O
her O
eye O
upon O
the O
stranger O
child O
as O
he O
pushed O
the O
morsel O
from O
him O
, O
and O
the O
smile O
that O
relaxed O
her O
features O
might O
have O
told O
him O
something O
, O
had O
he O
chanced O
to O
see O
, O
and O
understand O
it O
, O
respecting O
the O
excellent O
chance O
there O
was O
of O
his O
having O
a O
better O
appetite O
in O
future O
. O
A O
girl O
nearly O
of O
his O
own O
age O
sat O
on O
one S-CARDINAL
side O
, O
and O
a O
boy O
considerably O
older O
on O
the O
other O

the O
first S-ORDINAL
who O
had O
as O
much O
of O
beauty O
as O
it O
was O
perhaps O
, O
possible O
for O
any O
human O
being O
to O
have O
after O
a O
six S-CARDINAL
month's O
residence O
at O
Deep B-FAC
- I-FAC
Valley I-FAC
Mill E-FAC
, O
looked O
up O
into O
his O
face O
with O
a O
pair O
of O
large O
blue O
eyes O
that O
spoke O
unbounded O
pity O
, O
and O
he O
heard O
a O
soft O
little O
voice O
whisper O
, O
" O
Poor O
boy O
! O
" O
While O
his O
lanky O
neighbour O
on O
the O
other O
side O
made O
prize O
of O
the O
rejected O
food O
, O
venturing O
to O
say O
aloud O
, O
" O
Any O
how O
, O
it O
is O
too O
good O
to O
be O
wasted O
. O
" O
The O
wretched O
meal O
did O
not O
last O
long O
, O
and O
for O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes E-TIME
after O
it O
was O
ended O
, O
the O
governor O
and O
his O
wife O
disappeared O
. O
During O
this O
interval O
, O
those O
who O
had O
strength O
and O
inclination O
moved O
about O
the O
room O
as O
they O
listed O
, O
but O
by O
far O
the O
greater O
number O
were O
already O
dropping O
to O
sleep O
after O
a B-DATE
day E-DATE
of O
protracted O
labour O
, O
during O
which O
they O
had O
followed O
the O
ceaseless O
movements O
of O
the O
machinery O
, O
for O
above O
fifteen B-TIME
hours E-TIME
. O
Among O
the O
former O
was O
the O
hungry O
lad O
who O
had O
appropriated O
the O
oat O
- O
cake O
of O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
and O
no O
sooner O
were O
the O
eye O
of O
the O
master O
and O
mistress O
removed O
, O
than O
he O
turned O
to O
the O
new O
- O
comer O
, O
and O
in O
a O
tone O
that O
seemed O
to O
hover O
between O
good O
- O
humour O
and O
ridicule O
, O
said O
, O
" O
So O
you O
could O
not O
find O
a O
stomach O

your O
supper O

man O

" O
" O
I O
did O
not O

Michael S-PERSON

dolefully O
. O
" O
You O
did'nt O

it O

speaks O
better O

the O
living O

returned O
his O
new O
acquaintance O

" O

nothing O

nobody O

up O

into O
your O

when O
we O
goes O

I'll O
show O
you O

" O
Michael S-PERSON
was O
in O
the O
act O
of O
nodding O
assent O
to O
this O
proposal O
, O
when O
the O
woman O
, O
who O
five B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
before O
had O
left O
the O
room O
, O
returned O
to O
it O
, O
and O
by O
a O
very O
summary O
process O
caused O
the O
ragged O
, O
weary O
, O
prayerless O
, O
hopeless O
multitude O
to O
crawl O
and O
clamber O
, O
half S-CARDINAL
sleeping O
and O
half O
waking O
, O
to O
their O
filthy O
beds O
. O
They O
were O
divided O
by O
fifties S-DATE
in O
a O
room O
, O
but O
notwithstanding O
the O
number O
, O
and O
the O
little O
space O
in O
which O
they O
had O
to O
stow O
themselves O
, O
the O
stillness O
of O
heavy O
sleep O
pervaded O
every O
chamber O
, O
ere O
the O
miserable O
little O
inmates O
had O
been O
five B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
enclosed O
within O
the O
walls O

Poor O
Michael S-PERSON
lay O
as O
motionless O
as O
the O
rest O
, O
but O
he O
was O
not O
sleeping O
. O
Disappointment O
, O
fearful O
forebodings O
, O
and O
excessive O
nausea O
, O
all O
conspired O
to O
banish O
this O
only O
blessing O
that O
an O
apprenticed O
factory O
child O
can O
know O

that O
under O
most O
hard O

unrelenting O
masters O

till O
now O
, O
he O
had O
never O
known O
how O
very O
wretched O
his O
young O
thoughts O
could O
make O
him O
. O
His O
mother's O
fond O
caresses O

his O
brother's O
fervent O
love O

had O
in O

of O
toil O

sometimes O
in O
spite O
of O
hunger O
, O
cheered O

comforted O
the O
last O
moments O

every O
day O

The O
rude O
bed O
also O
, O
on O
which O
the O
brothers O
lay O

was O
too O
clean O

all O
the O
difficulty O

keeping O
it O
so O

to O
be O
tainted O
with O
the O
loathsome O
scent O
of O
oil O

sundry O
other O
abominations O
which O
rendered O
the O
place O
where O
he O
now O
lay O

almost O
intolerable O

to O
this O
den O

far O

far O
away O

only O
creatures O

The O
thought O
was O
almost O
too O
bitter O
to O
bear O

and O
the O
bundle O
of O
straw O
that O
served O
him O
for O

pillow O

received O
for O
the B-TIME
first I-TIME
hour I-TIME

the I-TIME
night E-TIME
a O
ceaseless O
flood O
of O
tears O

It O
was O
, O
as O
his O
young O
companion O
had O
predicted O
, O
by O
the O
sound O
of O
a O
flourished O
whip O

that O
he O
was O
awakened O
on O
the B-TIME

an O
instant O
he O
was O
on O
his O
feet O
, O

a O
minute O
or O
two S-CARDINAL
more O
sufficed O
to O
invest O
him O
in O
his O
clothes O

this O
speed O
, O
however O
, O
was O
the O
effect O
of O
terror O
, O
for O
he O
remembered O
not O
the O
invitation O
of O
the O
preceding O
evening O
. O
But O
hardly O
had O
he O
finished O
the O
operation O
of O
dressing O
, O
when O
Charley B-PERSON
Ford E-PERSON
, O
the O
boy O
who O
gave O
it O

by O
his O
side O

him O
a O
silent O
hint O
by O
a O
wink O
of O
the O
left O
eye O

a O
movement O
of O
the O
right O
elbow O
that O
he O
might O
follow O
him O
, O
turned O
away O
, O

ran O
down O
stairs O
. O
Michael S-PERSON
did O
so O
too O
, O
and O
presently O
found O
himself O
with O
a O
multitude O
of O
others O
in O
a O
small O
paved O
court O
, O
on O
one S-CARDINAL

either O

part O

pushing O
it O
open O
, O
disclosed O
to O
the O
eyes O
of O
Michael S-PERSON
a O
loathsome O

a O
fearful O
spectacle O

already O
made O
their O
way O
to O
the O
sort O
of O
rude O
farm O
- O
yard O
upon O
which O
this O
door O
opened O
, O
one O
and O
all O
of O
whom O
were O
intent O
upon O
purloining O
from O
a O
filthy O
trough O
just O
replenished O
for O
the O
morning O
meal O
of O
two S-CARDINAL
stout O
hogs O
, O
a O
variety O
of O
morsels O
which O
, O
as O
Michael's S-PERSON
new O
acquaintance O
assured O
him O
, O
were O
" O
dainty O
eating O
for O
the O
starving O
prentices O
of O
Deep B-LOC

" O
" O
Make O

, O
young'un O

" O
cried O
Charles S-PERSON
, O
good O
- O
naturedly O
, O
" O
or O
they O
won't O
leave O
a O
turnip O
— O
paring O
for O
us O
. O
" O
And O
on O
he O
rushed O
to O
the O
scuffle O
, O
leaving O
Michael S-PERSON
gazing O
with O
disgust O
and O
horror O
at O
the O
contest O
between O
the O
fierce O
snouts O
of O
the O
angry O
pigs O
, O
and O
the O
active O
fingers O
of O
the O
wretched O
crew O
who O
contested O
with O
them O
for O
the O
offal O
thus O
cast O
forth O
. O
place O
where O
little O
boys O
were O
treated O
with O
less O
care O
and O
tenderness O
than O
pigs O
! O
He O
turned O
away O
shuddering O
, O
and O
feeling O
almost O
unable O
to O
stand O
— O
and O
then O
the O
image O
of O
his O
mother O
seemed O
to O
rise O
before O
him O
— O
he O
felt O
her O
soft O
gentle O
kisses O
on O
his O
cheeks O
, O
and O
almost O
unconsciously O
pronounced O
her O
name O
. O
This O
dear O
name O
, O
lowly O
as O
it O
was O
murmured O
, O
came O
upon O
his O
ear O
so O
like O
the O
knell O
of O
happiness O
that O
was O
never O
to O
return O
, O
that O
the O
hard O
agony O
of O
his O
little O
heart O
melted O
before O
it O
, O
and O
sitting O
down O
upon O
a O
bundle O
of O
fagots O
that O
were O
piled O
up O
against O
the O
wall O
, O
he O
rested O
his O
burning O
head O
against O
the O
bricks O
, O
and O
burst O
into O
a O
passion O
of O
tears O
. O
At O
this O
moment O
he O
felt O
a O
hand O
upon O
his O
shoulder O
, O
and O
trembling O
from O
head O
to O
foot O
, O
he O
sprung O
upon O
his O
feet O
, O
and O
suddenly O
turning O
round O
beheld O
, O
instead O
of O
the O
savage O
features O
of O
the O
overlooker O
which O
his O
fancy O
had O
conjured O
up O
, O
the O
meekest O
, O
gentlest O
, O
loveliest O
little O
face O
, O
that O
ever O
eyes O
looked O
upon O
, O
within O
a B-QUANTITY
few I-QUANTITY
feet E-QUANTITY
of O
him O
. O
It O
was O
the O
same O
little O
girl O
who O
had O
been O
placed O
next O
him O
at O
the O
miserable O
supper O
of O
the O
preceding O
night O
, O
and O
whose O
low O
murmur O
of O
pity O
for O
all O
the O
sorrow O
he O
was O
come O
to O
share O
with O
her O
, O
had O
reached O
his O
ears O
and O
his O
heart O
. O
" O
You'll O
be O
strapped O
dreadful O
if O
you O
bide O
here O
, O
" O
said O
the O
child O
. O
" O
Come O
away O
— O
and O
don't O
let O
them O
see O
you O
cry O
! O
" O
But O
even O
as O
she O
spoke O
she O
turned O
from O
him O
, O
and O
ran O
towards O
the O
door O
through O
which O
the O
miserable O
pilferers O
of O
the O
pig- O
trough O
were O
already O
hurrying O
. O
Perhaps O
no O
other O
warning O
- O
voice O
would O
have O
been O
so O
promptly O
listened O
to O
at O
that O
moment O
by O
poor O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
for O
it O
was O
something O
very O
like O
the O
numbing O
effect O
of O
despair O
that O
seemed O
to O
have O
seized O
upon O
him O
, O
and O
it O
is O
likely O
enough O
he O
would O
have O
remained O
in O
the O
attitude O
he O
had O
taken O
, O
with O
his O
head O
resting O
against O
the O
wall O
, O
till O
the O
brutal O
violence O
of O
his O
task O
- O
master O
had O
dragged O
him O
from O
it O
, O
had O
not O
this O
pretty O
vision O
of O
pity O
appeared O
to O
warn O
him O
of O
his O
danger O
. O
He O
rose O
and O
followed O
her O
so O
quickly O
, O
that O
by O
the O
time O
she O
had O
reached O
the O
crowd O
of O
children O
who O
were O
still O
thronging O
round O
the O
pump O
, O
he O
was O
by O
her O
side O
. O
" O
Thank O
you O
! O
" O
whispered O
Michael S-PERSON
in O
her O
ear O
, O
" O
It O
was O
very O
kind O
of O
you O
to O
call O
me O
— O
and O
I O
shouldn't O
have O
come O
if O
you O
hadn't O
— O
for O
I O
shouldn't O
care O
very O
much O
if O
they O
killed O
me O
. O
" O
" O
That's O
very O
naughty O
! O
" O
said O
the O
little O
girl O
. O
" O
How O
can O
I O
be O
good O
? O
" O
demanded O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
while O
the O
tears O
again O
burst O
from O
his O
eyes O
. O
" O
' O
Twas O
mother O
that O
made O
me O
good O
before O
, O
and O
I O
don't O
think O
I O
shall O
ever O
see O
her O
any O
more O
. O
" O
" O
I O
never O
can O
see O
my O
mother O
any O
more O
, O
till O
I O
go O
to O
Heaven O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
little O
girl O
— O
" O
but O
I O
always O
think O
every O
day O
, O
that O
she O
told O
me O
before O
she O
died O
, O
about O
God's O
making O
every O
thing O
come O
right O
in O
the O
end O
, O
if O
we O
hear O
all O
things O
patiently O
for O
love O
of O
him O
. O
" O
" O
But O
God O
can't O
choose O
I O
should O
be O
taken O
from O
mother O
, O
and O
that's O
why O
I O
can't O
bear O
it O
, O
" O
said O
Michael S-PERSON
. O
The O
little O
girl O
shook O
her O
head O
, O
very O
evidently O
disapproving O
his O
theology O
. O
" O
How O
old O
are O
you O
? O
" O
said O
Michael S-PERSON

" O

answered O

" O

" O
I O

perhaps O

" O
And O
again O
the O

ran O
down O
his O
cheeks O
. O
" O

" O
Michael S-PERSON
opened O
his O
large O
eyes O
and O
looked O
at O
her O
with O
something O
like O
reproach O
. O
" O

we O

he O
repeated O
sadly O

" O

said O
the O

Michael S-PERSON

with O
an O
accent O
expressive O
of O
great O
respect O

" O

it O
better O

As O
Michael S-PERSON
ceased O
speaking O

felt O
the O
little O

shudder O

" O

she O

Such O
was O
the O
case O
with O
Fanny B-PERSON
Fletcher E-PERSON
. O
It O
was O
not O
till O
mother O
and O
father O
were O
both O
dead O

that O
she O
had O
ceased O
to O
hear O
the O
voice O
of O
love O
, O
and O
the O
precepts O
of O
religion O
. O
For O
three B-DATE
years E-DATE
she O
had O
, O
indeed O
, O
been O
supported O
by O
the O
labour O
of O
a O
poor O
widowed O
mother O
| | O
but O
being O
her O
only O
child O
, O
Fanny S-PERSON
had O
wanted O
nothing O
, O
had O
never O
been O
exposed O
to O
the O
hearing O
of O
coarse O
language O
, O
or O
the O
witnessing O
vicious O
habits O
, O
and O
all O
her O
little O
studies O
had O
been O
so O
thoroughly O
mixed O
up O
with O
religious O
feelings O
, O
that O
by O
the O
time O
she O
was O
ten B-DATE
years I-DATE
old E-DATE
, O
it O
would O
have O
been O
almost O
impossible O
to O
eradicate O
them O
, O
or O
rob O
her O
entirely O
of O
the O
gentle O
courage O
, O
and O
patient O
endurance O
, O
such O
feelings O
invariably O
lead O
to O
. O
When O
her O
mother O
died O
, O
all O
the O
world O
— O
her O
little O
world O
, O
consisting O
of O
a O
score O
of O
poor O
bodies O
of O
her O
own O
class O
, O
exclaimed O
, O
" O
Poor O
Fanny B-PERSON
Fletcher E-PERSON
! O
" O
But O
there O
was O
not O
one O
among O
them O
rich O
enough O
to O
save O
her O
from O
the O
workhouse O
, O
and O
to O
the O
workhouse O
therefore O
she O
went O
, O
whence O
within O
three B-DATE
months E-DATE
she O
was O
sent O
, O
with O
many O
others O
, O
as O
apprentices O
, O
to O
Deep B-LOC
Valley E-LOC
factory O
, O
ostensibly O
, O
and O
as O
doubtless O
the O
parish O
authorities O
believed O
, O
to O
learn O
a O
good O
trade O
, O
but O
in O
truth O
, O
to O
undergo O
a O
species O
of O
slavery O
, O
probably O
the O
most O
tremendous O
that O
young O
children O
were O
ever O
exposed O
to O
in O
any O
part O
of O
the O
known O
world O
, O
civilized O
or O
uncivilized O
. O
not O
yet O
reached O
that O
shrunk O
and O
wasted O
condition O
which O
was O
nearly O
general O
among O
her O
companions O
. O
Michael S-PERSON
looked O
at O
her O
as O
she O
bent O
over O
her O
threads O
, O
and O
repaired O
the O
incessant O
breakings O
among O
them O
with O
her O
white O
little O
hands O
, O
with O
a O
degree O
of O
love O
and O
pity O
which O
while O
it O
wrung O
his O
heart O
, O
softened O
the O
hard O
despair O
that O
had O
nearly O
seized O
upon O
him O
, O
by O
making O
him O
feel O
, O
that O
though O
his O
mother O
and O
his O
brother O
were O
lost O
to O
him O
for O
long O
long O
years O
, O
during O
which O
he O
was O
to O
taste O
of O
nothing O
but O
misery O
, O
still O
there O
was O
somebody O
who O
might O
grow O
to O
love O
him O
. O
This O
was O
a O
timely O
solace O
! O
Young O
as O
he O
was O
, O
he O
perceived O
at O
once O
, O
that O
instead O
of O
being O
brought O
to O
Deep B-LOC
Valley E-LOC
to O
learn O
a O
trade O
, O
he O
had O
been O
beguiled O
to O
enter O
there O
bound O
and O
helpless O
, O
for O
more O
years O
than O
he O
dared O
to O
count O
, O
and O
with O
no O
prospect O
of O
learning O
any O
thing O
beyond O
the O
same O
slavish O
process O
of O
waiting O
upon O
the O
machinery O
, O
which O
had O
painfully O
occupied O
his O
daily O
existence O
, O
and O
that O
of O
his O
dearer O
brother O
, O
as O
long O
as O
they O
could O
remember O
to O
have O
lived O
. O
Under O
these O
circumstances O
, O
it O
was O
truly O
a O
great O
blessing O
to O
have O
found O
somebody O
of O
whom O
he O
might O
make O
a O
friend O
, O
and O
so O
strongly O
did O
the O
poor O
little O
fellow O
feel O
it O
, O
that O
when O
the O
miserable O
band O
were O
led O
to O
their O
morning O
meal O
, O
he O
told O
Fanny S-PERSON
as O
he O
walked O
beside O
her O
, O
that O
he O
thought O
he O
should O
grow O
to O
behave O
better O
than O
he O
had O
done O
that O
morning O
, O
if O
she O
would O
always O
talk O
to O
him O
about O
good O
things O
, O
and O
let O
him O
talk O
about O
mother O
and O
Teddy S-PERSON
to O
her O
in O
return O
. O
" O
There's O
a O
good O
boy O
! O
" O
replied O
Fanny S-PERSON
, O
soothingly O
. O
" O
I O
will O
talk O
to O
you O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
whenever O
I O
can O
— O
and O
never O
mind O
, O

she O
added O
, O
as O
they O
sat O
down O
again O
side O
by O
side O
at O
the O
long O
dirty O
board O
that O
formed O
their O
breakfast O
table O
, O
" O
never O

what's O
good O
to O
eat O

it O
won't O
taste O

" O
" O
I O
won't O
mind O
it O
! O
" O
replied O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
manfully O
, O
as O
he O
supped O
the O
musty O
- O
flavoured O
watery O
mess O
. O
" O

I O
wish O

good O
bread O

followed O
Miss O

expedition O
to O
Hoxley B-FAC

lane E-FAC
, O
that O
young O
lady O
remained O
waiting O
at O
home O

not O
very O
patiently O
, O
for O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling's E-PERSON
promised O
communication O

But O
still O
it O
came O
not O
, O
and O
when O
, O
at O
an B-TIME
hour E-TIME
too O
late O
to O
hope O
for O
it O
any O
longer O
, O
she O
at O
length O
retired O
to O
bed O
, O
it O
was O
in O
a O
state O
of O
irritation O

anxiety O

left O
her O
little O
chance O
of O
quiet O
slumber O
. O
Pale O
, O
harassed O
, O
and O
fearing O
she O
knew O
not O
what O
for O
the O
little O
fellow O
, O
for O
whose O
safety O
she O
had O
undertaken O
to O
answer O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
joined O
her O
good O
nurse O
at O
the O
breakfast O

table O
, O
incapable O
of O
thinking O
or O
speaking O
upon O
any O
other O
subject O
. O
But O
it O
was O
in O
vain O
that O
the O
gentle O
- O
spirited O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
again O
and O
again O
declared O
it O
to O
be O
" O
impossible O

quite O
out O
of O
all O
likelihood O

that O

mean O
any O
harm O

Mary S-PERSON

by O
no O

them O

coming O
to O
the O

conclusion O

did O
the O
following O
letter O

handed O
to O
her O

she O
still O
sat O
before O
her O
untasted O
breakfast O

tend O
to O
tranquillize O
her O

It O
was O
from O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
himself O
, O
delicately O
enveloped O
, O
highly O
scented O

sealed O
with O
prodigiously O
fine O
armorial O
bearings O
on O
a O
shield O
, O
almost O
large O
enough O
to O
have O
adorned O
the O
panels O
of O
a O
carriage O

But O
all O
this O
perfection O
of O
elegance O
was O
lost O
on O
poor O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
whose O
heart O
, O
indeed O
, O
seemed O
to O
leap O
into O
her O
throat O

as O
she O
tore O
open O
the O
important O
despatch O

she O
turned O
the O

away O

" O
Good O
gracious O
, O
no O
, O
Miss O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
" O
replied O
her O
friend O
. O
For O
a O
moment O
, O
this O
opinion O
brought O
some O
consolation O
with O
it O
, O
simply O
from O
the O
decision O
with O
which O
it O
was O
uttered O
| | O
but O
the O
next O
, O
all O
her O
anxiety O
returned O
again O
, O
for O
though O
she O
felt O
that O
there O
was O
, O
perhaps O
, O
something O
improbable O
and O
exaggerated O
in O
the O
idea O
of O
the O
child's O
being O
kidnapped O
in O
the O
face O
of O
day O
, O
and O
at O
it O
were O
before O
a O
hundred S-CARDINAL
witnesses O
, O
there O
was O
at O
least O
no O
delusion O
as O
to O
his O
unhappy O
mother's O
state O
of O
mind O
respecting O
him O
, O
nor O
in O
the O
fact O
of O
her O
having O
in O
some O
sort O
pledged O
her O
own O
word O
, O
that O
the O
poor O
woman O
and O
her O
lame O
boy O
should O
receive O
tidings O
of O
him O
. O
A O
little O
further O
conversation O
with O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
, O
convinced O
her O
that O
her O
opinion O
on O
the O
subject O
could O
be O
of O
no O
great O
value O
, O
inasmuch O
as O
it O
was O
founded O
solely O
on O
the O
notion O
, O
that O
" O
it O
was O
not O
likely O
, O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
should O
want O
to O
hide O
away O
the O
little O
boy O
. O
" O
" O
No O
! O
" O
thought O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
" O
Nor O
was O
it O
likely O
he O
should O
have O
acted O
, O
looked O
, O
and O
spoken O
as O
I O
saw O
him O
do O
, O
when O
his O
poor O
girl O
lost O
her O
senses O
from O
agony O
at O
my O
having O
witnessed O
it O
. O
If O
I O
misdoubt O
him O
unjustly O
, O
I O
will O
be O
careful O
that O
it O
shall O
not O
injure O
him O
. O
I O
will O
await O
his O
own O
time O
for O
information O
. O
If O
it O
comes O
, O
no O
one O
will O
be O
the O
worse O
for O
the O
impatience O
with O
which O
I O
shall O
have O
waited O
for O
it O
. O
But O
, O
if O
it O
comes O
not O
, O
I O
can O
be O
doing O
no O
wrong O
by O
taking O
every O
means O
of O
seeking O
it O

" O
In O
conformity O
with O
this O
resolution O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
not O
only O
waited O
with O
tolerable O
external O
composure O
herself O
, O
but O
continued O
in O
a O
great O
degree O
to O
tranquillize O
the O
spirits O
of O
the O
widow O
Armstrong S-PERSON

likewise O

and O
during O
a B-DATE
whole I-DATE
week E-DATE
, O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
was O
permitted O
to O
remain O
unmolested O
. O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
, O
indeed O
, O
did O
not O
meet O
him O
under O
the O
greenwood O
- O
tree O
, O
pleading O
an O
indisposition O
, O
which O
was O
not O
quite O
imaginary O
, O
as O
her O
excuse O
, O
but O
she O
troubled O
him O
with O
nor O
more O
questions O

On O
the B-DATE
day E-DATE
fixed O
for O
this O
al O
fresco O
meeting O
of O
nearly O
the O
whole O
neighbourhood O
, O
Edward B-PERSON
Armstrong E-PERSON
was O
appointed O
to O
pay O
his O
first S-ORDINAL
visit O
to O
Millford B-FAC
Park E-FAC
. O
During O
her O
almost O
daily O
visits O
to O
his O
mother O
, O
she O
had O
remarked O
that O
, O
though O
he O
uttered O
not O
a O
word O
in O
contradiction O
of O
the O
reasonings O
, O
by O
which O
she O
sought O
to O
show O
the O
improbability O
that O
any O
mischief O
could O
have O
befallen O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
his O
speaking O
features O
expressed O
no O
confidence O
in O
them O
, O
and O
wishing O
upon O
this O
day O
of O
general O
riding O
and O
driving O
, O
to O
remain O
within O
her O
own O
gates O
, O
she O
determined O
to O
take O
the O
opportunity O
of O
conversing O
with O
him O
alone O
. O
She O
was O
by O
herself O
in O
her O
pretty O
boudoir O
when O
he O
arrived O
, O
and O
perceiving O
that O
his O
pale O
face O
was O
flushed O
by O
heat O
and O
exercise O
, O
she O
made O
him O
sit O
down O
on O
the O
sofa O
, O
beside O
her O
. O
There O
was O
something O
singularly O
sad O
in O
the O
utter O
indifference O
with O
which O
his O
young O
eye O
wandered O
over O
all O
the O
striking O
and O
unwonted O
objects O
that O
surrounded O
him O
. O
When O
bad O
to O
sit O
beside O
the O
young O
lady O
on O
her O
silken O
couch O
, O
he O
obeyed O
without O
seeming O
at O
all O
conscious O
that O
the O
rest O
he O
needed O
was O
now O
afforded O
in O
more O
dainty O
style O
than O
usual O
, O
and O
all O
the O
intelligence O
of O
his O
soul O
seemed O
settled O
in O
his O
eyes O
as O
he O
looked O
into O
the O
face O
of O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
, O
and O
faintly O
murmured O
— O
" O
Is O
there O
any O
news O
of O
him O
? O
" O
my O
dear O
boy O
, O
this O
delay O
cannot O
justify O
the O
look O
of O
misery O
it O
produces O
on O
your O
countenance O
. O
Tell O
me O
, O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
what O
is O
it O
that O
you O
fear O
for O
Michael S-PERSON
! O
" O
" O
I O
do O
not O
know O
myself O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
boy O
. O
" O
And O
yet O
I O
think O
it O
over O
in O
my O
head O
day O
and O
night O
only O
to O
find O
out O
what O
is O
the O
very O
worst O
possible O
they O
can O
do O
to O
him O
. O
" O
" O
But O
is O
that O
wise O
, O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
or O
is O
it O
right O
, O
think O
you O
, O
while O
your O
poor O
mother O
has O
only O
you O
left O
to O
comfort O
her O
, O
that O
you O
should O
only O
strive O
to O
fill O
your O
own O
head O
and O
hers O
with O
the O
very O
worst O
thoughts O
your O
fancy O
can O
conjure O
up O
? O
" O
" O
I O
do O
not O
fill O
mother's O
head O
with O
them O
, O
" O
replied O
Edward S-PERSON
. O
" O
I O
have O
never O
told O
her O
one S-CARDINAL
single O
word O
of O
all O
my O
dismal O
thoughts O
. O
" O
" O
Then O
you O
are O
a O
good O
boy O
, O
and O
I O
love O
you O
for O
it O
. O
But O
what O
are O
your O
dismal O
thoughts O
, O
Edward S-PERSON
? O
You O
may O
tell O
them O
to O
me O
. O
" O
The O
boy O
hesitated O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
and O
then O
said O
— O
" O
I O
think O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
is O
a O
wicked O
, O
cruel O
man O
| | O
and O
I O
think O
that O
he O
would O
be O
more O
likely O
to O
be O
wicked O
and O
cruel O
to O
Michael S-PERSON
than O
good O
to O
him O
. O
" O
" O
What O
is O
it O
has O
made O
you O
think O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
cruel O
and O
wicked O
, O
Edward S-PERSON
? O
" O
demanded O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
. O
" O
Because O
he O
is O
hard O
and O
unjust O
to O
those O
who O
labour O
for O
him O
— O
and O
because O
I O
have O
seen O
him O
laugh O
and O
make O
sport O
of O
the O
tears O
of O
little O
children O
. O
" O
There O
was O
something O
in O
the O
accents O
of O
the O
boy O
that O
startled O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
— O
She O
felt O
inclined O
to O
exclaim O
— O
" O
How O
much O
more O
older O
art O
thou O
than O
thy O
looks O
! O
" O
so O
thrilling O
was O
the O
tone O
, O
and O
so O
profound O
the O
feeling O
with O
which O
he O
spoke O
. O
" O
Yet O
still O
, O
" O
she O
replied O
, O
" O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
see O
that O
he O
could O
gain O
any O
advantage O
by O
ill O
- O
using O
Michael S-PERSON
in O
any O
way O
bad O
enough O
to O
make O
you O
look O
so O
miserable O
, O
Edward S-PERSON
. O
" O
" O
If O
he O
keeps O
him O
from O
me O
is O
not O
that O
enough O
? O
" O
said O
the O
pale O
boy O
, O
looking O
reproachfully O
at O
her O
. O
" O
But O
, O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
you O
knew O
that O
he O
was O
going O
to O
leave O
you O

and O
your O
mother O
, O
at O
least O
, O
consented O
to O
it O
. O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
she O
did O
consent O
to O
it O
. O
Poor O
, O
dear O
mother O
! O
She O
did O
consent O
to O
it O

had O
I O
been O
true O
, O
as O
I O
ought O
to O
have O
been O
, O
she O
never O
would O
, O
" O
said O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
clasping O
his O
hands O
and O
closing O
his O
eyes O
with O
a O
look O
of O
intense O
suffering O
. O
" O
Explain O
yourself O
, O
my O
dear O
boy O
, O
" O
said O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
kindly O
. O
" O
In O
what O
have O
you O
been O
otherwise O
than O
true O
? O
" O
" O
We O
agreed O
together O
— O
poor O
Michael S-PERSON
and O
me O
agreed O
together O
, O
never O
to O
let O
mother O
know O
how O
bad O
we O
were O
served O
at O
the O
mill O
— O
and O
, O
above O
all O
, O
we O
agreed O
that O
she O
should O
never O
know O
how O
miserable O
Michael S-PERSON
was O
at O
the O
great O
house O
, O
' O
cause O
we O
was O
sure O
she'd O
have O
him O
away O
, O
and O
so O
lose O
the O
bit O
of O
comfortable O
food O
she O
has O
been O
having O
. O
But O
it O
was O
wrong O
and O
wicked O
to O
deceive O
her O
. O
We O
should O
have O
told O
her O
all O
, O
and O
then O
Michael S-PERSON
would O
have O
never O
gone O
! O
" O
being O
still O
comforted O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
by O
our O
manner O
of O
talking O
to O
her O
. O
Fear O
not O
, O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
that O
I O
shall O
neglect O
the O
safety O
of O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
because O
you O
will O
not O
hear O
me O
talk O
of O
his O
being O
in O
any O
danger O
. O
I O
will O
not O
rest O
till O
I O
know O
what O
has O
become O
of O
him O
. O
" O
Mary S-PERSON
said O
this O
in O
a O
tone O
that O
left O
no O
doubt O
of O
her O
sincerity O
| | O
and O
it O
was O
then O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
that O
Edward S-PERSON
seemed O
to O
remember O
her O
greatness O
. O
He O
stood O
up O
before O
her O
with O
a O
look O
of O
tender O
reverence O
inexpressibly O
touching O
, O
and O
said O
solemnly O
— O
" O

God O
will O
bless O
you O

it O

" O
And O
he O
will O
bless O
you O
, O
my O
dear O
child O

replied O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
with O
tears O
starting O
to O
her O
eyes O
. O
" O
He O
will O
bless O
and O
comfort O
you O
for O
all O
your O
duty O
and O
affection O

Keep O
up O
your O
spirits O
, O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
and O
, O
above O
all O
things O

never O
be O
idle O

It O
is O
for O
your O
mother's O
sake O

well O
as O
your O
own O

I O
am O
so O
anxious O

learn O
to O
read O

dear O
Edward S-PERSON
— O
and O
by O
degrees O
we O
shall O
get O
you O
on O
to O
ciphering O
, O

who O
knows O

we O
may O
make O
a O
clerk O

accountant O

you O

get O
money O

health O

The O
boy O
smiled O
languidly O
as O
he O
replied O
, O
" O
I O
should O
like O

A O
gleam O

a O
bright O

mantled O

it O
was O
like O

God O
knows O

I O
ain't O
over O
strict O

good O
society O

I O
must O

do O
think O

carry O
the O

a O
little O

far O

a O
lady O

not O

nothing O

more O
thoroughly O
vulgar O

I O
certainly O
have O
lived O
too O
much O

really O
first S-ORDINAL

good O

I O
suppose O

nobody O
knows O
this O
neighbourhood O
better O
than O
I O
do O
. O
" O
" O
I O
am O
quite O
aware O
of O
that O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
the O
young O
lady O
very O
respectfully O
, O
" O
and O
that O
is O
one O
reason O
why O
I O
wish O
to O
talk O
to O
you O
about O
this O
notion O
of O
mine O
. O
Is O
it O
really O
true O
, O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
, O
that O
none O
of O
the O
ladies O
in O
the O
neighbourhood O
ever O
go O
into O
the O
factories O
? O
" O
" O
To O
be O
sure O
it O
is O
. O
Why O
should O
they O
go O
, O
for O
goodness O
sake O
? O
" O
" O
Oh O
! O
I O
don't O
know O
exactly O
. O
— O
But O
I O
cannot O
see O
why O
they O
should O
not O
— O
if O
they O
wish O
it O
, O
" O
replied O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
, O
modestly O
. O
" O
Well O
now O
, O
but O
I O
do O
, O
my O
dear O
. O
And O
I O
do O
beg O
and O
entreat O
that O
you O
won't O
talk O
any O
more O
about O
it O
. O
I O
am O
quite O
sure O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
that O
somebody O
or O
other O
has O
been O
talking O
nonsense O
to O
you O
, O
about O
all O
this O
. O
If O
you O
had O
got O
any O
friends O
or O
connexions O
towards O
Fairly O
now O
, O
I O
should O
think O
they O
had O
been O
telling O
you O
all O
the O
romantic O
stuff O
that O
has O
been O
hatching O
there O
about O
factory O
children O
, O
and O
God O
knows O
what O
beside O
. O
But O
I O
don't O
believe O
you O
have O
ever O
gone O
visiting O
that O
way O
, O
have O
you O
, O
my O
dear O
? O
" O
likely O
to O
talk O
to O
me O
on O
such O
a O
subject O
? O
" O
said O
Marry S-PERSON
, O
colouring O
to O
the O
temples O
, O
with O
eagerness O
to O
hear O
the O
answer O
. O
" O
Good O
gracious O
! O
my O
dear O
, O
did O
you O
never O
hear O
tell O
of O
that O
poor O
wrong O
- O
headed O
clergyman O

George B-PERSON
Bell E-PERSON
? O
Such O
a O
difference O
to O
be O
sure O
between O
one S-CARDINAL
man O

another O
. O
My O
dear O
good O
Mr. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
never O
in O
his O
life O
breathed O
a O
word O
that O
could O
hurt O
the O
feelings O
of O
his O
neighbours O
. O
He O
visited O
them O
every O
one O
, O
and O
was O
on O
the O
best O
and O
most O
friendly O
terms O
with O
them O
all O
, O
which O
is O
what O
I O
call O
living O
in O
the O
true O
spirit O
of O
Christian S-NORP
charity O
. O
Whereas O
this O
tiresome O
, O
troublesome O
, O
Mr. O
Bell S-PERSON
, O
has O
taken O
it O
into O
his O
head O
to O
find O
out O
wrong O
, O
where O
every O
body O
else O
sees O
nothing O
but O
right O

and O
God O
forbid O
, O
my O
dear O

that O
you O
should O
take O
it O
into O
your O
dear O
innocent O
head O
to O
follow O
any O
of O
his O
mischievous O
fancies O

I O
wonder O
what O
he'll O
get O
by O
it O
? O
Great O
goose O
he O
must O
be O
, O
to O
be O
sure O
, O
not O
to O
see O
that O
he O
is O
going O
exactly O
the O
way O
to O
set O
every O
body O
that O
can O
be O
of O
the O

use O

him O

against O
him O

all O
things O

" O
" O
What O
is O
it O
he O
does O
, O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
, O
that O
is O
so O
very O
wrong O
? O
" O
demanded O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
. O
" O
What O
is O
it O
he O
does O
? O
Why O
just O
every O
thing O
he O
ought O
not O
to O
do O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
that's O
all O
. O
You O
would O
hardly O
believe O
, O
perhaps O
, O
that O
a O
clergyman O
should O
actually O
encourage O
the O
poor O
to O
complain O
of O
the O
very O
labour O
by O
which O
they O
live O
? O
And O
yet O
I O
give O
you O
my O
word O
and O
honour O
that O
is O
exactly O
what O
he O
has O
been O
doing O
. O
It's O
incredible O
, O
isn't O
it O
, O
almost O
? O
He O
positively O
says O
, O
loud O
enough O
for O
all O
the O
country O
to O
hear O
him O
, O
that O
the O
labour O
in O
the O
factories O
— O
such O
a O
blessing O
as O
it O
is O
to O
the O
poor O
— O
he O
actually O
says O
that O
it O
is O
bad O
for O
the O
children's O
health O
. O
Such O
stuff O
, O
you O
know O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
as O
if O
the O
medical O
men O
did O
not O
know O
best O
| | O
and O
there's O
numbers O
of O
' O
em O
that O
declare O
that O
it's O
quite O
impossible O
to O
tell O
in O
any O
way O
satisfactory O
that O
it O
can O
do O
'em O
any O
harm O
at O
all O

And O
, O
upon O
my O
word O
, O
I O
don't O
know O
what O
poor O
people O
will O
come O
to O
! O
It's O
quite O
out O
of O
the O
question O
to O
attempt O
pleasing O
'em O
. O
If O
they've O
got O
no O
work O
they O
are O
perfectly O
outrageous O
about O
that O
, O
and O
ready O
to O
tear O
people O
to O
pieces O
just O
to O
get O
it O

and O
no O
sooner O
is O
there O
enough O
to O
do O
, O
than O
away O
they O
go O
bawling O
again O
, O
swearing O
that O
the O
children O
are O
over O
- O
worked O

isn't O
it O
provoking O
my O
dear O

Mr. O

Mary S-PERSON

very O
distinctly O

" O
Yes O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
that's O
the O
name O

the O
foolish O
man O

a O
pleasure O

not O
well O
enough O
off O

when O
I'm O
sure O
, O
by O
all O
I O
can O
hear O

understand O

these O
very O
identical O
people O

consider O
themselves O
first S-ORDINAL

foremost O
of O

interrogatively O

without O

stream O
of O
Mrs. O

to O
well O
forth O

Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
notice O
that O

to O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON

a O
moment O

As O
the O
business O
she O
was O
upon O

however O
, O
take O
some B-TIME

time O
for O

interrogated O
her O
coachman O
concerning O
distance O

so O
forth O

the O
hopeful O

animated O
girl O

sprung O
into O
her O
carriage O

the O
clock O
struck O
two S-CARDINAL

determined O
not O

her O
mansion O

she O
had O
lost O
some O
portion O
of O
the O
ignorance O
which O
had O
of O
late O
so O
cruelly O
tormented O
her O
. O
The O
roads O
were O
good O
, O
and O
by O
the O
help O
of O
a O
short O
bait O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
and O
her O
companion O
reached O
Fairly O
turnpike O
a O
little O
after O
four S-CARDINAL

Here O
she O
made O
inquiries O
for O
the O
residence O
of O
Mr. O
Bell S-PERSON
, O
and O
having O
learned O
in O
what O
direction O
she O
should O
find O
it O
, O
repeated O
the O
instructions O
to O
her O
coachman O

bade O
him O
drive O

James S-PERSON

not O

I O
suppose O

that O
is O

not O
at O
the O
clergyman's O
house O

of O
course O
you O
will O
be O
able O
to O
find O
some O
place O
quite O
near O

know O

William S-PERSON
must O
wait O

no O

these O

clear O

instructions O
James S-PERSON
answered O
" O
Yes O
ma'am O
, O
" O
and O
drove O
off O

In O
obedience O
to O
the O
directions O
received O
at O
the O
tollbar O
, O
the O
carriage O
soon O
left O
the O
high O

road O
, O
and O
proceeded O
down O
a O
grassy O
lane O
, O
which O
harvest O
carts O
for O
the O
time O
and O
rolled O
into O

brought O
the O
wanderers O
to O
another O
turning O

that O
in O
five B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
placed O
them O
before O
the O
gates O
of O
an O
edifice O

aspect O

made O
Mary S-PERSON
pull O

" O
That O
looks O

a O

Does O
it O
not O
? O
" O
said O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
. O
And O
before O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
could O
answer O
, O
William S-PERSON
had O
already O
opened O
the O
door O
, O
and O
let O
down O
the O
steps O
. O
It O
was O
very O
easy O
to O
get O
out O
, O
and O
very O
easy O
to O
inquire O
if O
Mr. O
Bell S-PERSON
were O
at O
home O
| | O
but O
when O
answered O
in O
the O
affirmative O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
felt O
that O
it O
was O
not O
very O
easy O
to O
decide O
in O
what O
manner O
to O
explain O
the O
cause O
of O
her O
visit O
to O
the O
object O
of O
it O
. O
She O
had O
by O
no O
means O
settled O
this O
point O
to O
her O
satisfaction O
, O
when O
the O
door O
of O
a O
small O
parlour O
, O
lined O
with O
books O
, O
was O
opened O
to O
her O
, O
and O
she O
found O
herself O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
gentleman O
she O
had O
so O
unceremoniously O
come O
to O
visit O
. O
There O
was O
much O
in O
the O
countenance O
of O
Mr. O
Bell S-PERSON
to O
reassure O
a O
more O
timid O
spirit O
than O
that O
of O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton E-PERSON
| | O
nevertheless O
she O
stood O
before O
him O
for O
a B-TIME
minute E-TIME
or O
two S-CARDINAL
in O
some O
embarrassment O
, O
not O
so O
much O
from O
fear O
of O
him O
, O
as O
of O
herself O
. O
Did O
she O
fail O
to O
make O
him O
at O
once O
understand O
the O
motive O
of O
her O
inquiries O
, O
he O
could O
not O
avoid O
thinking O
both O
them O
and O
herself O
impertinent O
, O
and O
this O
consciousness O
caused O
a O
much O
brighter O
glow O
than O
usual O
to O
mantle O
her O
cheeks O
, O
as O
the O
stood O
before O
him O
, O
with O
her O
eyes O
fixed O
timidly O
, O
and O
almost O
beseechingly O
, O
on O
his O
face O
. O
Although O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
had O
not O
quite O
the O
easy O
and O
( O
tant O
soit O
peu O
) O
assured O
air O
of O
a O
woman O
of O
fashion O
, O
there O
was O
enough O
in O
her O
appearance O
to O
indicate O
her O
claim O
to O
observance O
, O
as O
well O
as O
admiration O
, O
and O
Mr. O
Bell S-PERSON
opened O

earnestly O

His O

much O

more O

Circumstances O
, O
Mr. O
Bell S-PERSON
, O
have O
lately O
directed O
my O
attention O
to O
a O
subject O

my O
own O
situation O
in O
life O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
neighbourhood O
in O

I O
live O
ought O
to O
have O
long O
ago O
made O
thoroughly O

such O
is O
not O
the O
case O
, O
however O

I O
am O
profoundly O
, O
and O
I O
fear O
shamefully O
ignorant O
respecting O
the O
large O
and O
very O
important O
class O
of O
our O
population O
employed O
in O
the O
factories O

I O
am O
in O
possession O
of O
a O
large O
fortune O
wholly O
amassed O
from O
the O
profits O
obtained O
by O
my O
father O
from O
this O
species O
of O
labour O
, O
and O
I O
cannot O
but O
feel O
great O
interest O
in O
the O
welfare O
and O
prosperity O
of O
the O
people O
employed O
in O
it O
— O
especially O
as O
I O
understand O
a O
very O
large O
proportion O
of O

are O
young O
children O

and O
moreover O
, O
that O
from O
some O
cause O

other O

I O
can O
by O
no O

as O
I O
hear O
them O
called O

less O
kindness O

respect O
by O
those O
who O
have O
grown O
rich O
upon O
their O
industry O

description O
of O
human O

told O

that O
it O
would O
be O
unsafe O
, O
improper O

altogether O

mentioned O

took O
an O

come O

unceremoniously O

have O
the O
kindness O

give O

more O
accurate O
information O

I O
have O
found O
it O
possible O
to O
obtain O
elsewhere O
. O
" O
Mr. O
Bell S-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
placed O
himself O
immediately O
opposite O
to O
her O
, O
looked O
in O
her O
young O
face O
, O
and O
listened O
to O
her O
earnest O
voice O
as O
she O
spoke O
, O
with O
the O
deepest O
attention O
. O
It O
soon O
became O
sufficiently O
clear O
that O
he O
considered O
not O
this O
intrusion O
as O
requiring O
apology O
, O
but O
that O
on O
the O
contrary O
his O
very O
heart O
and O
soul O
were O
moved O
by O
her O
words O
. O
He O
paused O
for O
a O
moment O
after O
she O
had O
ceased O
speaking O
, O
as O
if O
unwilling O
to O
interrupt O
her O
by O
his O
reply O

but O
when O
he O
found O
that O
she O
remained O
silent O
, O
he O
said O
, O
" O
The O
subject O

you O

to O
converse O

dear O

assuredly O
the O
very O
last O

should O
have O
expected O
to O
hear O
named O
by O
a O
young O
lady O
in O
your O
position O
— O
for O
it O
is O
one O
from O
which O
the O
rich O
and O
great O
of O
our O
district O
turn O
away O
with O
loathing O
and O
contempt O
. O
Yet O
is O
it O
the O
one O
of O
all O
others O
to O
which O
I O
would O
if O
possible O
direct O
their O
best O
attention O

involving O

it O
does O
both O
their O
interest O

their O
duty O
beyond O
any O
other O
. O
But O
I O
fear O
I O
cannot O
enter O
upon O
it O
without O
wounding O
many O
prejudices O
which O
of O
necessity O
you O
must O
have O
imbibed O
, O
and O
proving O
to O
you O
that O
much O
which O
doubtless O
you O
have O
been O
educated O
to O
consider O
right O
, O
is O
on O
the O
contrary O
most O
lamentably O
wrong O

Can O
you O
bear O
this O
my O
dear O
young O

" O
I O
hope O

, O
in O
a O
search O
after O
truth O

Mr. O

even O
if O
my O

Mary S-PERSON

" O

have O
to O
remove O
many O
false O
impressions O

total O
absence O

I O

replied O
Mr. O
Bell S-PERSON

— O
" O

to O
me O
it O

a O
beguiling O

detain O

the O

form O
a O
class O

both O
from O

" O
" O

it O
difficult O

answer O
your O
question O
by O
a O
negative O

" O

in O

at O

not O
doubtingly O

with O
considerable O

together O
on O

ground O

seemingly O
half O
buried O
in O
the O
drift O
that O
was O
blown O
against O
them O

I O
stood O
still O
and O
gazed O
upon O
them O

I O
knew O
full O
well O
what O
, O

how O
great O
was O
the O
terror O
which O
had O
brought O
them O
there O
too O
soon O

in O
my O
heart O
of O
hearts O
I O
cursed O
the O
boasted O
manufacturing O
wealth O
of O
England S-GPE
, O
which O
running O
, O
in O
this O
direction O
at O
least O
, O
in O
a O
most O
darkened O
narrow O
channel O

gives O
power O

lawless O

irresistible O
to O
overwhelm O
and O
crush O
the O
land O
it O
pretends O
to O
fructify O

While O
still O
spell O
- O
bound O
by O
this O
appalling O
picture O
, O
I O
was O
startled O
by O
the O
sound O
of O
a O
low O
moaning O
from O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
road O
, O
at O
a O
short O
distance O
from O
me O
, O

turning O
towards O
it O
perceived O
a O
woman O
bending O
over O
a O
little O
girl O
who O
appeared O
sinking O
to O
the O
ground O
. O
A O
few O
rapid O
steps O
brought O
me O
close O
to O
them O
, O
and O
I O
found O
on O
examination O
that O
the O
child O
was O
so O
benumbed O
and O
exhausted O
as O
to O
be O
totally O
incapable O
of O
pursuing O
her O
way O
— O
it O
was O
her O
mother O

was O
urging O
her O
forward O

and O
who O
even O
then O
seemed O
more O
intent O
upon O
saving O
a O
fine O
, O
than O
on O
the O
obvious O
sufferings O
of O
her O
sinking O
child O
. O
I O
know O
, O
poor O
wretch O
, O
that O
little O
choice O
was O
left O
her O

that O
the O
inevitable O
consequence O
of O
saving O
her O
from O
the O
factory O

leading O
her O
gently O
home O
to O
such O
shelter O

her O
father's O
roof O
could O
give O

you O
must O
watch O

for O
it O

the O
point O

find O
most O
puzzling O
— O
why O
is O
it O
that O
these O

more O

it O
should O
seem O

than O
all O
the O

why O
, O
for O
this O
reason O
, O
instead O
of O
being O
honoured O
for O
their O

atrocious O

, O
England S-GPE

that O

not O

" O
" O
That O

together O

comes O
a O
state O

to O
the O

Nature O
recoils O

can O
you O

you O

believe O
me O
when O
I O
tell O
you O

Miss O

that O
the O
effect O

upon O
above O
two B-CARDINAL

beyond O

more O
deplorable O
, O
and O
many O
a O
child O

born O
amongst O

destiny O
, O
if O
fairly O
weighed O
against O
that O
of O
such O
a O
one O
as O
I O

described O

would O
appear O
incomparably O
more O
terrible O

such O
things O

idly O
by O

? O
" O
cried O
Mary S-PERSON
shuddering O
. O
" O
It O
seems O
as O
if O
the O
rulers O
of O
the O
land O
knew O
little O
, O
and O
cared O
less O
about O
it O
, O
" O
replied O
Mr. O
Bell S-PERSON
. O
" O
The O
profoundly O
ignorant O
opinion O
that O
there O

some O
connexion O

by O
some O
score O

North S-NORP

, O
I O
believe O
, O
produced O
much O
of O
the O
lamentable O
non-interference O
of O
which O
the O
disinterested O
few O
complain O
, O
who O
are O
near O
enough O
to O
look O
upon O
the O
frightful O
game O

Some O
individual O
voices O
have O
been O
most O
gloriously O
raised O
on O
this O
tremendous O
theme O

if O
they O
will O
be O
steadfast O

enduring O

they O
must O
and O
will O
prevail O

nature O

all O

vices O

not O
framed O

coldly O
on O
such O
horrors O
, O

permit O
them O
. O
But O
the O
remedial O
process O
is O
so O
slow O
— O
it O
is O
so O
difficult O
to O
arouse O
the O
attention O
, O
and O
awaken O
the O
feelings O
of O
busy O
men O

a O
distance O

connexion O

deeply O
deprecate O

this O

Mr. O

deeply O

auditor O

" O
what O

All O

" O
all O
that O

In O
the O
first S-ORDINAL

were O
there O
no O

irregular O
exactions O

the O
recurrence O

those O
fearful O
intervals O
when O
the O
starving O

thrown O
out O

employ O
by O
the O
accidents O
which O
cause O
a O
deficiency O
in O
the O

would O
not O
happen O

for O
in O
that O

a O
time O

From O
this O
would O
also O
follow O
the O
necessity O
of O
often O
employing O
adult O
hands O
, O
where O
now O

cheaper O
labour O
of O
children O

forced O
from O

, O
may O
be O
had O
for O
the O
sin O
of O

Then O
would O
the O
unnatural O
spectacle O
of O

with O
his O
own O
children O
— O
I O
trust O
I O
am O
excusable O
, O
knowing O
what O
I O
know O
, O
for O
misdoubting O
the O
disinterested O
benevolence O
of O
any O
act O
of O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling's E-PERSON
. O
Nevertheless O
it O
is O
certainly O
not O
easy O
to O
perceive O
why O
, O
after O
having O
so O
ostentatiously O
distinguished O
the O
boy O
, O
he O
should O
kidnap O
him O
, O
as O
it O
were O
, O
from O
his O
own O
house O
, O
in O
order O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
him O
. O
If O
, O
instead O
of O
being O
the O
object O
of O
especial O
favour O
, O
the O
little O
fellow O
had O
fallen O
under O
the O
rich O
knight's O
displeasure O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
, O
I O
should O
think O
it O
by O
no O
means O
improbable O
that O
he O
might O
have O
consigned O
him O
as O
an O
apprentice O
to O
some O
establishment O
, O
too O
notorious O
for O
its O
severity O
to O
make O
it O
desirable O
that O
his O
selection O
of O
it O
should O
be O
made O
known O
. O
But O
of O
this O
there O
seems O
neither O
proof O
nor O
likelihood O
. O
" O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
turned O
pale O
as O
she O
listened O
to O
this O
suggestion O
. O
" O
Nay O
, O
but O
there O
is O
both O
truth O
and O
likelihood O
in O
such O
a O
suspicion O
, O
" O
she O
exclaimed O
with O
considerable O
emotion O
, O
and O
after O
a O
moment's O
consideration O
, O
added O
, O
" O
I O
know O
no O
reason O
why O
I O
should O
conceal O
the O
cause O
I O
have O
for O
saying O
so O
— O
if O
you O
know O
not O
all O
, O
how O
can O
you O
give O
me O
counsel O
? O
" O
Hurriedly O
, O
and O
as O
briefly O
as O
possible O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
then O
recounted O
the O
scene O
she O
had O
witnessed O
in O
the O
green O
- O
room O
of O
the O
Dowlinglodge S-NORP
theatricals O
, O
but O
there O
was O
an O
unconscious O
and O
involuntary O
fervour O
in O
her O
manner O
of O
narrating O
it O
, O
which O
rendered O
it O
impossible O
to O
listen O
with O
indifference O
, O
or O
not O
to O
feel O
at O
the O
recital O
some O
portion O
of O
the O
indignation O
she O
had O
felt O
when O
it O
occurred O
. O
search O
, O
I O
will O
call O
upon O
you O
, O
if O
you O
will O
give O
me O
leave O
, O
to O
communicate O
it O
. O
" O
Most O
earnestly O
and O
truly O
did O
the O
heiress O
assure O
him O
that O
it O
was O
impossible O
she O
could O
receive O
a O
visit O
more O
calculated O
to O
give O
her O
pleasure O
, O
adding O
that O
whether O
the O
hint O
were O
obtained O
or O
not O
, O
she O
trusted O
the O
acquaintance O
she O
had O
so O
unceremoniously O
began O
, O
would O
not O
drop O
here O
and O
that O
by O
returning O
her O
visit O
, O
he O
would O
prove O
to O
her O
that O
he O
was O
not O
displeased O
by O
it O
. O
It O
rarely O
happens O
between O
right O
- O
hearted O
people O
who O
meet O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
, O
if O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
parties O
conceives O
a O
liking O
for O
the O
other O
, O
that O
it O
fails O
to O
prove O
mutual O
| | O
and O
it O
was O
with O
a O
cordial O
sincerity O
, O
as O
genuine O
as O
her O
own O
, O
that O
Mr. O
Bell S-PERSON
expressed O
his O
hope O
that O
their O
acquaintance O
would O
ripen O
into O
friendship O
. O
Too O
intently O
occupied O
by O
all O
that O
had O
passed O
, O
to O
remember O
her O
own O
arrangements O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
forgot O
that O
her O
carriage O
was O
not O
at O
the O
door O
, O
and O
while O
these O
parting O
words O
were O
exchanged O
, O
walked O
forth O
, O
expecting O
to O
find O
it O
. O
It O
was O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
who O
first S-ORDINAL
recollected O
that O
the O
coachman O
had O
been O
ordered O
to O
put O
up O
his O
horses O
at O
the O
nearest O
inn O
, O
but O
this O
was O
not O
till O
they O
had O
traversed O
the O
little O
garden O
, O
and O
were O
already O
in O
the O
lane O
| | O
for O
though O
the O
good O
nurse O
had O
been O
little O
more O
than O
personnage O
muet O
during O
the O
foregoing O
scene O
, O
she O
had O
taken O
a O
deep O
interest O
in O
it O
, O
and O
it O
was O
much O
with O
the O
air O
of O
one O
awaking O
from O
a O
dream O
, O
that O
she O
said O
, O
" O
My O
dear O
Miss O
Mary S-PERSON
! O
you O
have O
forgot O
that O
the O
carriage O
is O
sent O
away O
. O
" O
" O
Indeed O
have O
I O
! O
" O
said O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
laughing O
, O
" O
and O
no O
wonder O
. O
But O
there O
stands O
our O
faithful O
William S-PERSON
, O
he O
will O
tell O
us O
in O
what O
direction O
we O
may O
find O
it O
. O
" O
" O
Will O
you O
not O
return O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
, O
while O
it O
is O
made O
ready O
? O
" O
said O
the O
clergyman O
. O
" O
Not O
if O
you O
will O
walk O
on O
with O
us O
, O
dear O
sir O
. O
The O
evening O
is O
delightful O
, O
but O
already O
quite O
far O
enough O
advanced O
to O
make O
it O
prudent O
not O
to O
lose O
any O
time O
. O
" O
And O
having O
given O
orders O
that O
the O
carriage O
was O
to O
follow O
, O
they O
strolled O
on O
towards O
the O
turnpike O
. O
" O
There O
, O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Bell S-PERSON
, O
pointing O
to O
the O
towering O
chimneys O
of O
a O
large O
factory O
at O
some O
distance O
, O
" O
there O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
, O
is O
an O
establishment O
where O
, O
though O
carding O
and O
spinning O
go O
on O
within O
the O
walls O
, O
and O
some O
hundreds S-CARDINAL
of O
children O
and O
young O
girls O
are O
employed O
in O
attending O
the O
machinery O
that O
performs O
the O
process O
, O
the O
voice O
of O
misery O
is O
never O
heard O
, O
for O
there O
the O
love O
of O
gold O
is O
chained O
and O
held O
captive O
by O
religion O
and O
humanity O
. O
" O
" O
Thank O
God O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
as O
she O
looked O
at O
the O
sinless O
monster O
to O
which O
he O
pointed O
. O
" O
It O
is O
not O
of O
necessity O
then O
, O
that O
this O
dangerous O
trade O
is O
fatal O
to O
all O
employed O
in O
it O
. O
" O
bad O
ones O
in O
his O
commercial O
enterprises O
. O
The O
high O
- O
minded O
owners O
of O
yonder O
factory O
are O
losing O
thousands S-CARDINAL
every O
year O
by O
their O
efforts O
to O
purify O
this O
traffic O
of O
its O
enormities O
— O
and O
some B-CARDINAL
thousand E-CARDINAL
small O
still O
voices O
call O
down O
blessings O
on O
them O
for O
it O
. O
But O
while O
it O
costs O
them B-MONEY
ten I-MONEY
shillings E-MONEY

produce O
what O
their O
neighbours O
can O
bring O
into O
the O
market O
for O
nine S-CARDINAL
, O
they O
will O
only O
be O
pointed O
at O
as O
pitiably O
unwise O
in O
their O
generation O
by O
all O
the O
great O
family O
of O
Mammon S-PERSON
which O
surrounds O
them O
. O
Few O
, O
alas O
! O
will O
think O
of O
following O
the O
example O
! O
All O
they O
can O
do O
therefore O
is O
in O
fact O
but O
to O
carry O
on O
a O
system O
of O
private O
charity O
on O
an O
enormous O
scale O
— O
but O
till O
they O
are O
supported O
by O
law O
, O
even O
their O
vast O
efforts O
, O
and O
most O
noble O
sacrifices O
can O
do O
nothing O
towards O
the O
general O
redemption O
of O
our O
poor O
northern O
people O
from O
the O
state O
of O
slavery O
into O
which O
they O
have O
fallen O
. O
And O
yet O
I O
do O
believe O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
, O
" O
he O
continued O
, O
after O
a O
pause O
, O
" O
I O
do O
most O
truly O
believe O
that O
these O
greedy O
tyrants O
would O
fail O
more O

than O
now O
they O
do O
in O
their O
efforts O

realize O
enormous O
wealth O

if O
the O
system O
were O
to O
undergo O
exactly O
the O
change O
we O
ask O
for O
. O
The O
plan O
of O
under-selling O
may O
indeed O
in O
some O
few O
instances O
enable O
a O
very O
lucky O
man O
to O
run O
up O
a O
blood O
- O
stained O
fortune O

and O
blood O
- O
stained O
it O
must O
be O
, O
for O
whenever O
this O
method O
of O
commanding O
a O
sale O
is O
pursued O
, O
and O
ruin O
does O
NOT O
ensue O

it O
is O
demonstrable O
that O
the O
bones O

marrow O
of O
children O

working O
unlimited O
hours O
, O
must O
have O
been O
the O
main O
agent O
in O
the O
operation O

But O
it O
is O
quite O
certain O
that O
the O
underselling O
system O
must O
upon O
the O
long O
run O
be O
ruinous O
. O
If O
all O
the O
losses O
upon O

were O
fairly O
set O
against O
all O

from O
the O
immoderate O

to O
the O
purpose O
for O
which O
it O
was O
designed O
. O
In O
addition O
to O
all O
this O
, O
the O
food O
was O
miserably O
scanty O
, O
and O
of O
a O
nature O
so O
totally O
unfit O
to O
sustain O
the O
strength O
of O
growing O
children O
thus O
severely O
worked O
, O
that O
within O
a O
fortnight O
after O
Michael's S-PERSON
arrival O
, O
an O
epidemic O
fever O
of O
a O
very O
alarming O
description O
began O
to O
shew O
itself O
. O
But O
it O
had O
made O
considerable O
progress O
, O
before O
the O
presence O
of O
this O
new O
horror O
was O
revealed O
to O
him O
. O
Notwithstanding O
all O
the O
hardships O
of O
Brookford S-GPE
factory O
, O
no O
infectious O
disease O
had O
ever O
appeared O
there O
, O
which O
it O
is O
possible O
might O
have O
been O
owing O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
labourers O
in O
it O
lived O
at O
a O
considerable O
distance O
, O
thus O
insuring O
to O
them O
a O
walk O
morning O
and O
night O
, O
through O
the O
fresh O
air O
. O
This O
, O
though O
it O
added O
to O
their O
daily O
fatigue O
, O
probably O
lessened O
the O
danger O
of O
it O
, O
while O
the O
wretched O
hovels O
to O
which O
they O
returned O
for O
their O
short O
night's O
rest O
, O
miserable O
shelters O
as O
they O
were O
, O
reeked O
not O
with O
the O
congregated O
effluvia O
of O
fifty S-CARDINAL
uncleansed O
sleepers O
in O
one S-CARDINAL
chamber O
! O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
therefore O
, O
had O
never O
before O
witnessed O
the O
hideous O
approach O
of O
contagion O
. O
The O
general O
appearance O
too O
of O
the O
Deep B-LOC
Valley E-LOC
troop O
was O
so O
far O
from O
healthy O
, O
that O
the O
sickly O
aspect O
of O
those O
first S-ORDINAL
seized O
upon O
was O
less O
remarkable O
than O
it O
would O
have O
been O
elsewhere O
. O
Thus O
another B-DATE
week E-DATE
wore O
away O
, O
during O
which O
, O
though O
several O
of O
those O
who O
had O
been O
working O
when O
it O
began O
were O
withdrawn O
, O
and O
known O
to O
be O
in O
the O
sick O
- O
ward O
ere O
it O
closed O
, O
the O
fact O
that O
an O
infectious O
fever O
was O
among O
them O
had O
not O
yet O
got O
wing O
. O
" O
Poor O
dear O
Betsy B-PERSON
Price E-PERSON
! O
" O
whispered O
Fanny B-PERSON
Fletcher E-PERSON
to O
her O
friend O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
as O
they O
sat O
side O
by O
side O
at O
their O
miserable O
dinner O
one B-DATE
day E-DATE
. O
" O
I O
heard O
missis O
tell O
master O
that O
she O
was O
dead O
. O
But O
I O
am O
trying O
to O
be O
glad O
for O
it O
Michael S-PERSON
. O
" O
liked O
her O
more O
than O
any O
other O
girl O
in O
the O
mill O
, O
and O
now O
you O
are O
glad O
she O
is O
dead O
! O
" O
" O
I O
am O
not O
so O
glad O
as O
I O
think O
I O
ought O
to O
be O
, O
" O
returned O
Fanny S-PERSON
gently O
. O
" O
She O
will O
not O
be O
hungry O
in O
Heaven O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
nor O
will O
she O
work O
till O
she O
is O
ready O
to O
fall O
: O
and O
surely O
God O
will O
give O
us O
green O
fields O
and O
sweet O
fresh O
air O
in O
Heaven O
, O
and O
there O
must O
be O
flowers O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
. O
Oh O
! O
I O
am O
quite O
sure O
of O
that O
, O
and O
Betsy B-PERSON
Price E-PERSON
will O
have O
it O
all O
! O
Ought O
I O
not O
to O
be O
very O
, O
very O
, O
glad O
? O
" O
Michael S-PERSON
looked O
in O
her O
sweet O
, O
innocent O
face O
, O
as O
she O
said O
this O
, O
and O
tears O
filled O
his O
eyes O
. O
" O
And O
if O
you O
die O
, O
Fanny S-PERSON
, O
must O
I O
be O
glad O
too O
? O
" O
" O
If O
you O
thought O
about O
Heaven O
as O
I O
do O
, O
and O
if O
you O
loved O
me O
very O
much O
indeed O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
little O
girl O
, O
" O
I O
can't O
tell O
how O
you O
could O
help O
being O
glad O
. O
" O
" O
But O
I O
do O
love O
you O
very O
much O
indeed O
, O
" O
said O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
almost O
choked O
by O
his O
efforts O
not O
to O
cry O
, O
" O
and O
I O
do O
think O
of O
Heaven O
, O
too O
, O
Fanny S-PERSON
, O
but O
I O
could'nt O
be O
glad O
if O
you O
was O
to O
die O
! O
" O
" O
Not O
when O
you O
hear O
that O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
! O
" O
said O
Fanny S-PERSON
, O
starting O
up O
as O
the O
lash O
of O
the O
governor's O
whip O
resounded O
through O
the O
room O
as O
a O
signal O
that O
their O
numbered O
moments O
of O
rest O
were O
over O
. O
" O
I O
suppose O
then O
I O
love O
you O
better O
than O
you O
love O
me O
, O
for O
I O
could O
not O
help O
being O
glad O
if O
I O
knew O
that O
you O
would O
never O
hear O
nor O
feel O
that O
lash O
again O
! O
" O
When O
they O
met O
again O
at O
supper O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
though O
still O
unsuspicious O
of O
the O
cause O
, O
missed O
three S-CARDINAL
more O
children O
from O
their O
places O
. O
He O
fancied O
, O
too O
, O
that O
there O
was O
something O
new O
and O
strange O
in O
the O
aspect O
of O
their O
hard O
- O
featured O
female O
tyrant O
| | O
she O
was O
paler O
than O
usual O
, O
scolded O
not O
at O
all O
, O
and O
when O
she O
spoke O
to O
her O
husband O
, O
it O
was O
in O
a O
voice O
that O
hardly O
exceeded O
a O
whisper O
. O
Yet O
, O
notwithstanding O
this O
, O
some O
young O
ears O
again O
caught O
words O
that O
told O
of O
death O
. O
Yet O
still O
the O
mill O
worked O
on O
, O
and O
nothing O
seemed O
to O
mark O
that O
any O
calamity O
more O
than O
usual O
had O
got O
among O
them O
. O
By O
degrees O
, O
however O
, O
the O
growing O
pestilence O
burst O
forth O
, O
as O
it O
were O
, O
before O
the O
eyes O
of O
the O
terrified O
children O
, O
and O
they O
knew O
that O
the O
grave O
yawned O
before O
them O
all O
. O
Then O
it O
was O
that O
the O
ghastly O
countenances O
of O
each O
doomed O
victim O
struck O
dismay O
into O
the O
hearts O
of O
their O
companions O
even O
before O
they O
were O
permitted O
to O
leave O
their O
labour O
, O
and O
sink O
down O
to O
the O
rest O
that O
should O
be O
disturbed O
no O
more O
. O
But O
still O
the O
mill O
went O
on O
, O
for O
Mr. O
Elgood B-PERSON
Sharpton E-PERSON
had O
just O
received O
a O
glorious O
order O
from O
Russia S-GPE
, O
and O
it O
would O
have O
been O
perfect O
madness O
, O
as O
this O
gentlemen O
was O
heard O
to O
remark O
to O
his O
eldest O
son O
, O
if O
a O
death O
or O
two S-CARDINAL
among O
the O
apprentice O
children O
was O
to O
check O
the O
mill O
at O
such O
a O
time O
as O
that O
. O
So O
the O
mill O
went O
on O
, O
and O
death O
went O
on O
too O
. O
But O
as O
it O
is O
considered O
by O
all O
parties O
concerned O
to O
be O
extremely O
important O
that O
the O
cry O
of O
epidemic O
contagion O
should O
not O
be O
raised O
in O
the O
neighbourhood O
of O
a O
factory O
under O
these O
circumstances O
, O
it O
was O
deemed O
best O
by O
Mr. O
Elgood B-PERSON
Sharpton E-PERSON
, O
and O
his O
confidential O
managers O
, O
not O
to O
call O
in O
medical O
assistance O
. O
no O
manner O
of O
use O
. O
I O
never O
knew O
any O
proper O
, O
regular O
contagious O
fever O
in O
my O
life O
, O
that O
could O
be O
stopped O
short O
by O
a O
doctor O
. O
You O
must O
take O
care O
of O
yourself O
and O
your O
wife O
, O
of O
course O
, O
and O
I O
will O
see O
that O
you O
have O
a O
hamper O
of O
good O
old O
port O
sent O
in O
, O
and O
mind O
that O
you O
both O
of O
you O
take O
two S-CARDINAL
glasses O
a O
day O
each O
, O
Poulet S-PERSON
— O
one O
before O
you O
go O
into O
the O
rooms O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
and O
the O
other O
, O
after O
you O
have O
seen O
them O
all O
down O
for O
the O
night O
, O
and O
we O
must O
order O
in O
a O
cask O
of O
vinegar O
to O
sprinkle O
the O
chambers O
. O
Trust O
me O
that O
this O
will O
do O
more O
good O
than O
all O
the O
doctors O
that O
ever O
were O
hatched O
. O
Besides O
the O
vinegar O
cask O
will O
never O
sing O
out O
you O
know O
, O
Poulet S-PERSON
, O
and O
the O
doctor O
might O
. O
" O
To O
this O
reasoning O
, O
and O
to O
these O
arrangements O
, O
no O
objection O
whatever O
was O
made O
by O
the O
governor O
of O
the O
apprentice O
- O
house O
. O
Of O
athletic O
frame O
, O
and O
iron O
nerves O
, O
he O
grinned O
defiance O
at O
any O
danger O
that O
threatened O
his O
own O
person O
, O
rightly O
enough O
thinking O
, O
perhaps O
, O
that O
any O
disease O
to O
which O
his O
water O
- O
porridge O
- O
fed O
troop O
appeared O
peculiarly O
liable O
, O
would O
be O
little O
likely O
to O
attack O
himself O
. O
It O
was O
, O
however O
, O
not O
the O
least O
part O
of O
his O
wisdom O
upon O
this O
occasion O
, O
that O
he O
systematically O
paid O
as O
little O
attention O
to O
what O
was O
going O
on O
round O
him O
as O
possible O
. O
Had O
he O
made O
it O
a O
habit O
to O
look O
into O
the O
haggard O
faces O
of O
the O
drooping O
children O
, O
as O
one O
after O
another O
they O
pined O
, O
languished O
, O
and O
sunk O
, O
first S-ORDINAL
into O
the O
horrible O
abyss O
of O
wretchedness O
called O
the O
sick O

ward O

and O
then O
into O
the O
grave O
, O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
he O
too O
might O
in O
some O
degree O
have O
been O
shaken O
. O
As O
it O
was O
, O
however O
, O
he O
went O
on O
so O
cleverly O
supplying O
the O
missing O
hands O
by O
recommending O
to O
the O
manager O
that O
one S-CARDINAL
healthy O
child O
should O
do O
the O
work O
of O
two S-CARDINAL
, O
and O
so O
cleverly O
, O
also O
, O
getting O
all O
that O
died O
by O
day O
buried O
by O
night O
, O
without O
making O
, O
as O
he O
said O
, O
any O
fuss O
or O
fidget O
about O
it O
whatever O
, O
that O
Mr. O
Elgood B-PERSON
Sharpton E-PERSON
felt O
him O
to O
be O
eminently O
deserving O
of O
an O
especial O
reward O
, O
and O
when O
fifteen S-CARDINAL
children O
had O
been O
noiselessly O
buried O
, O
in O
Tugswell S-GPE
churchyard O
, O
he O
presented O
him O
with O
a O
Bank B-ORG
of I-ORG
England E-ORG
note O
for O
ten B-QUANTITY

not O

well O

with O
his O
wife O

Whether O
it O

that O
the O

less O

against O
the O
malaria O
with O
which O
she O
was O
surrounded O
, O
a O
visible O
change O
came O
over O
her O
about B-DATE
three I-DATE
weeks E-DATE
after O
this O
visitation O
had O

no O

itself O

The O
large O
dark O
eye O
grew O
dim O

sunk O
back O
behind O
her O
high O
cheek O

bones O
by O
degrees O
. O
Her O
coarse O
firm O

set O
features O
appeared O
to O
relax O
, O
and O
her O
active O
limbs O
to O
languish O
, O
for O
two B-DATE
whole I-DATE
days E-DATE
before O
she O
yielded O
herself O
to O
the O
invincible O
power O
that O
had O
seized O
upon O
her O

how O
much O
they O
were O
emboldened O
to O
this O
hardy O
defiance O
of O
a O
standing O
law O
by O
the O
unwonted O
stillness O
of O
tongue O

tameness O
of O
aspect O
observable O
in O
Mrs. O
Poulet S-PERSON

But O
if O
they O
fancied O
they O
were O
to O
escape O
entirely O
they O
were O
mistaken O

the O
little O

ought O
always O
, O
at O
work O

or O
not O
at O
work O
, O
to O
be O
thinking O
of O
God O
, O
who O
was O
perhaps O
thinking O
of O
them O
, O
and O
meaning O
to O
take O
them O
both O
up O
together O
to O
his O
own O
happy O
Heaven O
, O
just O
as O
she O
had O
laid O
her O
hand O
on O
his O
to O
enforce O
her O
words O
, O
and O
looking O
wistfully O
in O
his O
face O
pronounced O
aloud O
, O
" O
Do O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
do O
! O
" O
the O
sick O
dragon O
stepped O
back O
on O
hearing O
them O
, O
from O
the O
passage O
that O
led O
into O
the O
kitchen O
, O
and O
turning O
her O
ghastly O
face O
full O
upon O
them O
, O
exclaimed O
, O
while O
her O
languid O
fist O
strove O
in O
vain O
to O
clench O
and O
raise O
itself O
, O
as O
in O
days O
of O
yore O
, O
to O
threaten O
castigation O
. O
" O
Do O
! O
you O
devil's O
imps O
! O
I'll O
do O
ye O
! O
Off O
to O
your O

" O
But O
ere O
she O
could O
finish O
the O
sentence O
, O
her O
fever O
- O
laden O
sinews O
relaxed O
, O
and O
seizing O
upon O
the O
long O
table O
for O
support O
she O
sank O
almost O
insensible O
upon O
a O
bench O
. O
Greatly O
terrified O
, O
both O
Michael S-PERSON
and O
Fanny S-PERSON
screamed O
together O
, O
but O
they O
screamed O
in O
vain O
. O
There O
was O
no O
longer O
any O
one O
within O
hearing O
save O
in O
the O
closely O
packed O
chamber O
above O

where O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
twenty E-CARDINAL
sick O
children O
lay O
two S-CARDINAL

two S-CARDINAL
together O
, O
in O
their O
miserable O
beds O
, O
but O
totally O
without O
nurses O
or O
attendants O
of O
any O
kind O
, O
so O
that O
their O
loud O
cries O
, O
though O
heard O
by O
many O
brought O
assistance O
from O
none O
. O
" O
Oh O

Michael S-PERSON
! O
Michael S-PERSON
! O
she'll O
die O
too O
! O
" O
said O
Fanny S-PERSON
shuddering O
. O
" O
I O
would O
make O

" O
The O
little O
girl O
endeavoured O
to O
raise O
the O
woman's O
head O
, O
which O
had O
sunk O
upon O
the O
table O
, O
but O
the O
effort O
was O
beyond O
her O
strength O
, O
and O
feeling O
after O
a O
moment's O
reflection O
that O
the O
best O
manner O
of O
assisting O
her O
would O
be O
to O
call O
others O
, O
she O
cried O
, O
" O
No O

very O

But O
when O
it O
became O
generally O
known O
that O
the O
awful O
strength O
of O
Mrs. O
Poulet S-PERSON
was O
laid O
low O
, O
and O
when O
the O
words O
, O
" O
the O

cautched O
her O
! O
" O
had O
once O
been O
pronounced O
aloud O
, O
the O
palpable O
image O
of O
the O
pale O
tyrant O
seemed O
to O
stand O
frowning O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
them O
, O
substituting O
his O
grisley O
hour O
- O
glass O
and O
scythe O
for O
the O
fist O
, O
and O
the O
frown O
he O
had O
conquered O
. O
The O
scene O
which O
followed O
this O
was O
very O
frightful O
. O
— O
Those O
upon O
whom O
infection O
had O
seized O
, O
sunk O
from O
their O
work O
at O
once O
, O
despite O
the O
goading O
thong O
which O
had O
hitherto O
kept O
them O
from O
dropping O
— O
as O
the O
spur O
and O
the O
lash O
sustain O
the O
failing O
post O
- O
horse O
. O
While O
those O
who O
were O
yet O
untouched O
looked O
in O
each O
other's O
faces O
as O
if O
to O
watch O
who O
next O
should O
fall O
. O
When O
the O
children O
from O
all O
the O
different O
floors O
of O
the O
fabric O
met O
together O
at O
their O
midday O
meal O
, O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
thought O
of O
each O
seemed O
to O
be O
the O
finding O
out O
who O
was O
missing O
since O
last O
they O
assembled O
, O
and O
the O
shudder O
that O
followed O
the O
perceiving O
another O
and O
another O
, O
and O
another O
gone O
, O
ran O
along O
the O
shortening O
lines O
with O
an O
agony O
which O
grew O
more O
and O
more O
intense O
as O
their O
numbers O
lessened O
. O
When O
things O
had O
reached O
this O
state O
, O
Mr. O
Elgood B-PERSON
Sharpton E-PERSON
agreed O
with O
Mr. O
Poulet S-PERSON
that O
it O
might O
perhaps O
be O
as O
well O
to O
let O
an O
apothecary O
from O
Tugswell S-PERSON
visit O
the O
factory O
, O
to O
which O
reluctant O
decision O
two S-CARDINAL
reasons O
strongly O
contributed O
. O
The O
first S-ORDINAL
was O
, O
that O
though O
with O
his O
usual O
fore O
- O
thought O
he O
had O
divided O
his O
nocturnal O
burying O
between O
the O
churchyards O
of O
Tugswell S-GPE
and O
Meddington S-GPE
, O
the O
clergymen O
of O
both O
had O
declared O
that O
their O
frequency O
rendered O
it O
necessary O
that O
some O
inquiry O
should O
be O
made O
into O
the O
cause O
of O
so O
great O
a O
mortality O
— O
and O
the O
second S-ORDINAL
was O
that O
the O
fact O
of O
the O
mistress O
of O
the O
apprentice O
house O
, O
being O
herself O
at O
the O
point O
of O
death O
from O
the O
same O
malady O
, O
must O
infallibly O
prove O
to O
the O
medical O
visitant O
that O
it O
was O
no O
treatment O
peculiar O
to O
the O
children O
which O
had O
occasioned O
it O
, O
but O
that O
it O
had O
come O
beyond O
all O
possibility O
of O
contradiction O
by O
the O
visitation O
of O
God O
. O
Nevertheless O
the O
medical O
gentleman O
ventured O
to O
declare O
that O
nothing O
would O
be O
so O
likely O
to O
stop O
the O
contagion O
as O
nourishing O
food O
| | O
upon O
which O
the O
terrified O
manufacturer O
astonished O
all O
the O
butchers O
within O
his O
reach O
, O
by O
commanding O
a O
large O
supply O
of O
beef O
and O
mutton O
" O
good O
enough O
to O
make O
wholesome O
soup O
, O
" O
and O
before O
another O
ghastly O
week O
had O
passed O
away O
, O
the O
wisdom O
of O
this O
prescription O
became O
so O
evident O
that O
when O
settling O
accounts O
together O
at O
the O
end O
of O
it O
, O
Mr. O
Poulet S-PERSON
hinted O
to O
his O
employer O
that O
he O
did O
not O
feel O
quite O
sure O
whether O
upon O
the O
whole O
a O
little O
better O
living O
for O
the O
apprentices O
might O
not O
pay O
. O
For O
all O
answer O
Mr. O
Elgood B-PERSON
Sharpton E-PERSON
put O
his O
finger O
to O
the O
sum O
total O
for O
provisions O
during O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
week E-DATE
, O
and O
then O
turning O
back O
a O
page O
or O
two S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
huge O
volume O
, O
did O
the O
same O
by O
the O
sum O
total O
of O
a O
former O
week S-DATE
. O
can't O
be O
denied O
, O
that O
if O
we O
go O
on O
this O
fashion O
we O
shall O
have O
no O
hands O
left O
to O
work O
with O
— O
and O
there O
would O
be O
but O
small O
profit O
in O
that O
sir O

" O
" O
My O
dear O

you O

not O

attentively O
as O

replied O
his O
enlightened O
master O

" O
Just O
at O
this O
moment O
it O
may O
be O
very O
right O
to O
cram O
them O
for O
several O
reasons O
— O
the O
best O
being O
, O
observe O
, O
that O
by O
so O

we O
stop O
more O

as O

in O
the O

expense O

this O
fit O

over O

it O

quite O
out O

I O
do O
beg O

Poulet S-PERSON

it O

I O

With O
a O
light O

challenged O

the O
governor O

widower O

was O
, O
Mr. O
Elgood B-PERSON

rose O
to O
depart O

Poulet S-PERSON
attended O
him O
to O
the O
outer O
gate O
, O
and O
held O
his O
stirrup O
while O
he O
mounted O
, O
reiterating O
his O
promises O
to O
do O
the O
best O
he O
could O
, O

only O
stipulating O

plenty O

vinegar O

the O
cold O
weather O
came O
in O

passed O
without O
many O
fresh O
victims O
sinking O
under O
its O
influence O
, O
and O
it O
was O
no O
uncommon O
thing O
to O
see O
two S-CARDINAL
or O
three S-CARDINAL
wheelbarrows O
at O
a O
time O
, O
towards O
the O
evening O
of O
every O
day O
, O
conveying O
children O
from O
the O
factory O
to O
the O
apprentice O

house O
who O
had O
fallen O
while O
following O
the O
machinery O

For O
a B-DATE
whole I-DATE
week E-DATE
after O
the O
death O
of O
Mrs. O
Poulet S-PERSON
, O
Michael S-PERSON
and O
his O
friend O
Fanny S-PERSON
, O
both O
continued O
as O
it O
seemed O
, O
unscathed O
, O
and O
many O
were O
the O
grave O
discussions O
between O
them O
, O
as O
to O
whether O
they O
ought O
to O
be O
sorry O
or O
glad O
that O
they O
were O
so O
— O
Fanny S-PERSON
very O
steadily O
adhering O
to O
her O
first S-ORDINAL
opinion O
, O
that O
if O
they O
had O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
love O
for O
each O
other O
, O
they O
would O
not O
let O
themselves O
be O
sorry O
, O
if O
one O
saw O
the O
other O
go O
away O
, O
and O
Michael S-PERSON
as O
steadily O
persisting O
that O
right O
or O
wrong O
he O
must O
be O
so O
very O
sorry O
if O
Fanny S-PERSON
went O
, O
as O
not O
to O
care O
at O
all O
how O
soon O
he O
followed O
after O
. O
The O
disinterested O
reasonings O
of O
the O
little O
girl O
were O
soon O
put O
to O
the O
proof O
. O
Michael S-PERSON
looked O
so O
very O
ill O
one B-TIME
morning E-TIME
at O
breakfast O
, O
that O
even O
the O
iron O
- O
hearted O
Poulet S-PERSON
told O
him O
he O
had O
best O
mount O
to O
the O
sick O
ward O
before O
it O
was O
needful O
to O
carry O
him O
| | O
but O
Michael S-PERSON
looked O
at O
poor O
Fanny S-PERSON
, O
and O
saw O
such O
an O
expression O
of O
terror O
and O
misery O
in O
her O
countenance O
, O
that O
he O
could O
not O
help O
thinking O
she O
would O
change O
her O
mind O
about O
being O
glad O
, O
if O
he O
did O
not O
go O
into O
work O
along O
with O
her O
. O
So O
he O
told O
the O
governor O
that O
he O
wasn't O
bad O
at O
all O
, O
and O
had O
rather O
work O
than O
not O
| | O
an O
assurance O
, O
which O
it O
could O
not O
, O
under O
any O
circumstances O
, O
be O
Mr. O
Poulet's S-PERSON
duty O
to O
combat O
| | O
and O
accordingly O
Michael S-PERSON
got O
to O
his O
place O
in O
the O
mill O
, O
and O
spoke O
cheeringly O
to O
Fanny S-PERSON
as O
he O
went O
along O
. O
But O
before O
the B-TIME
hour E-TIME
of O
dinner O
he O
was O
on O
the O
floor O
, O
and O
when O
the O
overlooker O
called O
to O
a O
stretcher O
to O
have O
him O
wheelbarrowed O
back O
to O
the O
' O
Prenticehouse S-FAC
, O
Fanny B-PERSON
Fletcher E-PERSON
thought O
that O
she O
certainly O
did O
not O
love O
poor O
Michael B-PERSON
Armstrong E-PERSON
so O
much O
as O
she O
fancied O
she O
did O
, O
for O
that O
if O
the O
choice O
had O
been O
given O
her O
, O
she O
would O
a O
great O
deal O
rather O
have O
been O
taken O
ill O
herself O
. O
And O
spite O
of O
a O
strap O
that O
she O
saw O
coming O
towards O
her O
, O
and O
flourishing O
ready O
for O
duty O
in O
the O
air O
, O
she O
helped O
to O
drag O
the O
unresisting O
body O
of O
her O
poor O
companion O
from O
before O
the O
mules O
, O
and O
thoughtless O
and O
reckless O
of O
the O
consequences O
, O
sat O
down O
and O
held O
his O
head O
on O
her O
knee O
, O
till O
he O
was O
raised O
in O
the O
arms O
of O
the O
stretcher O
and O
carried O
off O
. O
It O
was O
then O
, O
and O
not O
till O
then O
, O
that O
her O
tears O
began O
to O
flow O
, O
and O
they O
flowed O
so O
fast O
, O
that O
she O
could O
no O
longer O
see O
the O
uplifted O
strap O
, O
nor O
was O
it O
till O
the O
blow O
had O
descended O
sharply O
on O
her O
arm O
that O
she O
was O
sufficiently O
mistress O
of O
her O
thoughts O
to O
remember O
, O
that O
there O
was O
at O
any O
rate O
a O
hope O
that O
it O
might O
be O
her O
turn O
next O
, O
and O
with O
this O
to O
comfort O
her O
, O
she O
yielded O
meekly O
to O
the O
arm O
that O
pushed O
her O
to O
her O
usual O
place O
, O
and O
resumed O
her O
occupation O
with O
more O
stedfast O
courage O
, O
than O
at O
that O
moment O
any O
other O
hope O
could O
have O
given O
her O
. O
But O
even O
this O
sad O
hope O
proved O
vain O
. O
Fanny B-PERSON
Fletcher E-PERSON
still O
continued O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
very O
few O
upon O
whom O
the O
contagion O
had O
no O
effect O
. O
For O
the B-DATE
first I-DATE
day I-DATE
or I-DATE
two E-DATE
after O
the O
removal O
of O
her O
friend O
, O
her O
mind O
, O
was O
almost O
wholly O
occupied O
by O
the O
expectation O
of O
feeling O
the O
same O
symptoms O
that O
she O
had O
witnessed O
in O
him O
| | O
and O
when O
these O
came O
not O
, O
her O
thoughts O
reverted O
to O
the O
possibility O
of O
his O
recovering O
and O
coming O
again O
to O
work O
near O
her O
. O
It O
was O
an O
established O
custom O
among O
those O
who O
alone O
could O
give O
information O
on O
the O
subject O
, O
never O
to O
permit O
any O
questionings O
concerning O
the O
sick O
, O
or O
if O
they O
were O
boldly O
hazarded O
, O
to O
give O
no O
other O
reply O
than O
a O
rebuke O
. O
So O
that O
day O
after O
day O
, O
and O
week B-DATE
after I-DATE
week E-DATE
elapsed O
, O
without O
her O
being O
at O
all O
able O
to O
guess O
, O
whether O
Michael S-PERSON
were O
dead O
or O
alive O
. O
By O
degrees O
, O
however O
, O
all O
hope O
of O
seeing O
him O
return O
, O
faded O
from O
her O
mind O
, O
and O
then O
, O
poor O
little O
girl O
, O
she O
found O
out O
that O
people O
can't O
always O
wish O
truly O
and O
really O
for O
what O
they O
know O
to O
be O
best O
either O
for O
themselves O
or O
others O
. O
And O
day O
by O
day O
, O
though O
still O
the O
fever O
touched O
her O
not O
, O
she O
grew O
more O
pale O
, O
more O
thin O
, O
more O
melancholy O
. O
Now O
and O
then O
, O
indeed O
, O
it O
still O
occurred O
to O
her O
as O
possible O
that O
Michael S-PERSON
might O
reappear O
again O
, O
as O
many O
had O
done O
after O
many B-DATE
days E-DATE
of O
sickness O
| | O
but O
, O
alas O
! O
none O
had O
ever O
staid O
away O
so O
long O
as O
he O
had O
done O
! O
She O
had O
questioned O
many O
who O
had O
been O
ill O
concerning O
him O
, O
but O
none O
seemed O
to O
know O
or O
care O
any O
thing O
about O
those O
who O
had O
shared O
the O
sick O
chamber O
with O
them O
| | O
till O
at O
length O
, O
a O
boy O
to O
whom O
she O
had O
often O
addressed O
these O
questions O
, O
because O
she O
happened O
to O
know O
that O
he O
had O
been O
taken O
to O
the O
sick O
ward O
on O
the B-DATE
same I-DATE
day E-DATE
as O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
replied O
as O
if O
by O
a O
sudden O
effort O
of O
recollection O
, O
" O
Oh O
! O
that O
chap O
? O
Him O
what O
was O
one O
of O
the O
last O
as O
come O
? O
Ay O
, O
ay O
, O
I O
mind O
all O
about O
him O
. O
He O
was O
dead O
and O
buried O
before O
he O
had O
been O
down O
three B-DATE
days E-DATE
. O
" O
Fanny B-PERSON
Fletcher E-PERSON
asked O
no O
more O
questions O
, O
nor O
had O
she O
any O
longer O
hope O
of O
following O
where O
so O
many O
of O
her O
happier O
companions O
were O
gone O
. O
The O
fever O
was O
pronounced O
to O
be O
over O

the O

appeared O
to O
be O
going O

prosperously O

usual O

a O
statement O
which O
could O
be O
hardly O
impeached O
by O
the O
fact O
that O

good O

can O
you O
do O

by O
listening O
to O
all O
the O
shocking O

you O

I O
dare O

he O
is O
a O
very O
good O
man O

he O
looks O
like O
it O
, O
but O
upon O
my O
word O
I O
think O
he O
is O
doing O
nothing O

just O
wasting O
his O
time O
, O
as O
well O
as O
yourself O

for O
though O
I O
sat O

nothing O

was O
my O
place O

I O
listened O
to O
every O
word O

it O
is O
just O
because O
I O
believe O
every O
word O
was O
true O

that O
common O
sense O
makes O
me O
see O
there's O
no O
good O
to O
talk O
about O
it O

Indeed O
, O

indeed O
, O
my O
darling O

I O
would O
not O
make O
free O
to O
talk O
to O
you O
in O
this O
way O

which O
looks O
for O
all O
the O

do O
make O
up O
your O

give O
up O
at O
once O

for O

this O
bothering O
yourself O
for O
everlasting O
about O
the O

which O
you O
can O
no O
more O
stop O

than O
you O

the O

from O
rising O
in O

morning O

and O
setting O
at O
night O

" O
Here O
the O
good O
woman O
ceased O
, O
and O
looked O
with O
some O
anxiety O
in O
the O
thoughtful O
eyes O
of O
her O
young O
mistress O
. O
She O
felt O
that O
she O
did O
not O
understand O
their O
expression O
, O
and O
no O
wonder O
, O
for O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton E-PERSON
herself O
sat O
silently O
doubting O
how O
she O
should O
answer O
her O
. O
A O
languid O
feeling O
, O
proceeding O
partly O
from O
fatigue O
and O
indisposition O
, O
and O
partly O
from O
the O
discouraging O
conviction O
that O
she O
had O
no O
very O
satisfactory O
arguments O
by O
which O
to O
rebut O
her O
old O
friend's O
charge O
of O
useless O
devotion O
to O
a O
hopless O
cause O
, O
made O
her O
for O
some B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
unwilling O
to O
speak O
at O
all O
. O
Then O
came O
a O
somewhat O
peevish O
wish O
to O
interdict O
for O
ever O
the O
discussion O
of O
the O
subject O
between O
them O

but O
as O
she O
raised O
her O
eyes O
to O
utter O
it O
, O
she O
encountered O
a O
look O
of O
such O
humble O
love O
, O
deprecating O
her O
displeasure O
, O
yet O
fondly O
clinging O
to O
the O
freedom O
which O
risked O
the O
incuring O
it O
, O
that O
her O
purpose O
suddenly O
changed O
, O
and O
instead O
of O
the O
chilling O
command O
she O
was O
meditating O
, O
she O
threw O
her O
arms O
round O
the O
old O
woman's O
neck O
, O
exclaiming O
, O
" O
Oh O
! O
my O
dear O
nurse O

much O

how O
very O

all O

you O
any O

about O
it O

You O
are O
so O
sweet O

so O
gentle O
to O
me O

that O
I O
am O
quite O
sure O
you O
will O
not O
long O
think O
my O
heart O
is O
hard O

then O
by O
degrees O
you O
will O
find O
out O
that O
I O
am O
right O

then O
all O
will O
go O
well O
again O

Nurse O

the O

the O
impossibility O

stem O
the O
torrent O
with O
which O
avarice O

cruelty O
are O
overwhelming O
the O
land O

is O
made O
evident O
to O
me O

So O
much O
, O
dear O
nurse O

I O
concede O
to O
you O

therefore O
on O
that O

my O

patience O
with O
me O

I O
tell O
you O
that O
there O

some O

heard O
of O
the O

you O
have O
heard O
more B-CARDINAL

one E-CARDINAL
excellent O
charity O
sermon O
preached O
in O

of O
the O

these O
poor O

black O
people O
from O
the O
tyranny O

how O

you O
think O
this O
happy O

been O
brought O
about O

making O
that O
most O
good O

righteous O
law O

replied O
nurse O
Tremlett S-PERSON

" O
And O
how O
were O
they O
persuaded O
to O
make O
that O
law O

think O
you O
? O
" O
demanded O
Mary S-PERSON

" O
I O
can't O
tell O
how O
that O
was O
brought O
about O
, O
my O
dear O

I O
suppose O
it O
was O
because O
they O
saw O
that O
it O
was O
right O

fit O

" O
" O
It O
was O
brought O
about O

by O
the O
voices O
of O
the O
people O
of O
England S-GPE

were O
for O
years S-DATE
raised O
quietly O

with O
no O
breach O
of O

with O
patient O

unshrinking O
perseverance O
against O
this O
great O
sin O
, O
till O
the O
lengthened O
cry O

no O
longer O
resisted O

the O
law O
they O
perseveringly O
asked O

was O
granted O
to O
them O

Do O
you O
think O

nurse O
Tremlett S-PERSON
, O
that O
if O
during O
these O
years O
of O
orderly O
, O

steady O
remonstrance O
, O
every O
Englishman S-NORP

acted O
upon O
the O
principle O
you O
recommend O

had O
turned O
their O
thoughts O
and O
their O
conversation O
from O
the O
subject O
of O
negro O

knew O
that O

individually O
possessed O
no O
power O

stop O
it O

you O
think O
that O
if O
such O
had O
been O
the O
system O
acted O
upon O

England S-GPE
would O
now O

eagerly O

" O
This O
was O
the O
last O
time O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton E-PERSON
had O
to O
do O
battle O
with O
her O
nurse O
on O
the O
subject O
of O
the O
factory O
system O

Once O
awakened O
to O
a O
sense O
of O
its O
tyranny O
and O
injustice O
, O
and O
made O
to O
feel O
that O
the O
only O
hope O
of O
remedy O
lay O
in O
the O
possibility O
of O
universally O
raising O
British S-NORP
feeling O
against O

there O
was O
no O
danger O
that O
the O
right O

would O
ever O
again O
turn O
with O
indifference O

weariness O
, O
or O
displeasure O

from O
the O
theme O

Her O
young O
mistress O
felt O
that O
she O
had O
touched O
the O
right O
string O
, O
and O
that O
she O
should O
never O
again O
have O
to O
fear O
discord O
where O
it O
was O
so O
essential O
to O
her O
comfort O
to O
find O
harmony O

This O
change O
was O
really O
a O
comfort O
, O
and O
she O
felt O
it O
to O
be O
so O
, O
removing O
as O
it O
did O
one S-CARDINAL
irksome O
feature O
from O
her O
situation O
, O
and O
for O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes E-TIME
it O
cheered O
her O
, O
and O
she O
said O
so O
, O
cordially O
, O
but O
the O
next O
, O
a O
pang O
shot O
to O
her O
heart O
, O
as O
she O
rememebered O
that O
this O
assurance O
of O
accordant O
counsels O
with O
her O
venerable O
nurse O
, O
could O
avail O
her O
nothing O
in O
the O
most O
painful O
of O
all O
her O
difficulties O
, O
for O
it O
promised O
no O
help O
either O
in O
obtaining O
light O
upon O
the O
mystery O
of O
poor O
Michael's S-PERSON
abode O
, O
or O
in O
the O
still O
more O
pressing O
embarrassment O
of O
confessing O
to O
his O
unhappy O
mother O
and O
brother O
the O
impossibility O
of O
obtaining O
it O

Yet O
this O
painful O
task O
must O
be O
performed O
, O
and O
that O
without O
delay O
, O
for O
well O
she O
knew O
that O
every O
hour O
that O
passed O
without O
their O
seeing O
her O
, O
would O
be O
rendered O
dreadful O
, O
both O
by O
the O
agony O
of O
fear O
, O
and O
the O
sickening O
hot O
and O
cold O
fits O
of O
uncertainty O
. O
But O
never O
had O
she O
felt O
herself O
so O
very O
a O
coward O
as O
while O
meditating O
this O
visit O
of O
the O
morrow O
. O
She O
saw O
in O
imagination O
the O
eager O
questioning O
of O
Edward's S-PERSON
speaking O
eyes O
, O
and O
the O
heavy O
glance O
of O
his O
mother O
, O
anticipating O
the O
worst O
she O
had O
to O
tell O
. O
Sometimes O
she O
thought O
she O
would O
await O
the O
coming O
of O
the O
boy O
to O
take O
his O
place O
in O
the O
school O
, O
and O
let O
him O
report O
the O
failure O
of O
all O
her O
inquiries O
to O
the O
poor O
widow O
. O
But O
there O
was O
a O
selfish O
cowardice O
in O
this O
which O
instantly O
struck O
her O
, O
and O
she O
seemed O
to O
hate O
herself O
for O
the O
suggestion O
. O
For O
above B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour E-TIME
after O
she O
had O
laid O
her O
head O
upon O
her O
pillow O
these O
thoughts O
kept O
her O
painfully O
awake O
, O
and O
it O
was O
only O
after O
deciding O
that O
she O
would O
once O
more O
see O
Martha B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
, O
and O
try O
the O
effect O
of O
repeating O
to O
her O
, O
but O
without O
quoting O
her O
authority O
, O
the O
dark O
hints O
she O
had O
listened O
to O
, O
respecting O
Sir O
Matthew's S-PERSON
possible O
motives O
. O
It O
was O
only O
when O
her O
restless O
thoughts O
had O
fixed O
themselves O
on O
this O
, O
that O
she O
at O
length O
closed O
her O
aching O
eyes O
in O
sleep O
. O
she O
wished O
for O

without O
paying O
for O
it O
the O
penalty O
of O
such O
a O
visit O
. O
She O
wrote O
as O
follows O
: O
" O
My O
dear O
Miss O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
" O
I O
trust O
you O
are O
too O
goodnatured O
to O
be O
angry O
with O
me O
, O
even O
if O
you O
should O
think O
that O
I O
am O
taking O
a O
great O
liberty O
with O
you O
. O
But O
the O
truth O
is O
, O
that O
I O
much O
wish O
for O
the O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
you O
, O
and O
yet O
am O
too O
idle O
this O
morning O
to O
venture O
upon O
a O
drive O
. O
Will O
you O
then O
have O
the O
great O
kindness O
to O
pass O
the O
morning O
with O
me O
here O
? O
I O
send O
my O
carriage O
, O
lest O
Lady B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
should O
not O
have O
one O
at O
leisure O
to O
send O
with O
you O
. O
" O
Believe O
me O
, O
my O
dear O
Miss O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
" O
Yours O
very O
sincerely O
, O
" O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton E-PERSON
. O
" O
Having O
written O
, O
folded O
, O
and O
sealed O
this O
epistle O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
recollected O
that O
it O
would O
be O
impossible O
to O
send O
it O
for O
at B-TIME
least I-TIME
four I-TIME
hours E-TIME
, O
and O
she O
smiled O
first S-ORDINAL
, O
and O
then O
sighed O
, O
as O
she O
thought O
of O
the O
restless O
but O
useless O
activity O
which O
had O
caused O
her O
so O
needlessly O
to O
forestall O
her O
usual O
hour O
of O
rising O
. O
It O
would O
, O
in O
truth O
, O
have O
been O
better O
for O
her O
, O
poor O
girl O
, O
could O
she O
have O
slept O
through O
the O
time O
, O
for O
her O
waking O
thoughts O
had O
little O
that O
was O
pleasant O
to O
rest O
upon O
. O
Even O
the O
commencement O
of O
Edward's S-PERSON
studies O
, O
to O
which O
she O
had O
before O
looked O
forward O
with O
great O
delight O
, O
now O
recurred O
to O
her O
only O
to O
bring O
the O
recollection O
that O
if O
she O
saw O
him O
, O
his O
thoughts O
would O
be O
neither O
of O
his O
new O
clothes O
nor O
his O
new O
books O
, O
but O
of O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
and O
of O
her O
promise O
to O
get O
tidings O
of O
him O
. O
For O
his O
sake O
, O
and O
her O
own O
too O
, O
she O
determined O
at O
least O
to O
escape O
this O
interview O
, O
feeling O
that O
it O
would O
be O
better O
for O
all O
parties O
that O
no O
tidings O
should O
be O
delivered O
to O
both O
mother O
and O
son O
at O
once O
, O
which O
could O
be O
done O
after O
his O
school O
hours O
, O
by O
her O
driving O
to O
Hoxley B-FAC
- I-FAC
lane E-FAC
, O
after O
she O
had O
taken O
Martha S-PERSON
home O
. O
In O
pursuance O
of O
this O
resolution O
, O
she O
walked O
to O
the O
school O
- O
house O
, O
renewed O
her O
orders O
that O
the O
greatest O
attention O
should O
be O
paid O
to O
the O
new O
scholar O
, O
Edward B-PERSON
Armstrong E-PERSON
, O
and O
care O
taken O
that O
if O
he O
were O
found O
backward O
for O
his O
age O
, O
he O
should O
neither O
be O
laughed O
at O
nor O
chid O
. O
She O
then O
left O
a O
message O
for O
him O
, O
stating O
that O
she O
should O
be O
engaged O
all O
the O
morning O
, O
but O
would O
see O
him O
at O
his O
mother's O
house O
, O
after O
he O
left O
school O
. O
At O
eleven B-TIME
o'clock E-TIME
Miss O
Brotherton's S-PERSON
equipage O
set O
off O
for O
Dowlinglodge S-PERSON
, O
bearing O
her O
letter O
to O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
and O
the O
interval O
till O
its O
return O
was O
an O
anxious O
one O
. O
First S-ORDINAL
she O
felt O
doubtful O
if O
her O
unusual O
invitation O
would O
be O
accepted O
| | O
and O
if O
it O
were O
, O
she O
felt O
more O
doubtful O
still O
as O
to O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
scene O
which O
must O
follow O
. O
Nothing O
short O
of O
her O
earnest O
wish O
to O
redeem O
her O
promise O
to O
Mrs. O
Armstrong S-PERSON
could O
have O
given O
Mary S-PERSON
courage O
to O
do O
what O
she O
now O
meditated O
. O
her O
father O
, O
the O
tremendous O
effect O
of O
which O
upon O
her O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
had O
already O
witnessed O
, O
was O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
very O
last O
measures O
she O
could O
have O
been O
led O
to O
adopt O
. O
But O
a O
strong O
and O
stern O
feeling O
of O
justice O
, O
urged O
her O
not O
to O
shrink O
from O
this O
. O
It O
was O
evident O
from O
the O
statement O
of O
Mrs. O
Armstrong S-PERSON
that O
Martha S-PERSON
had O
been O
actively O
instrumental O
in O
sending O
Michael S-PERSON
to O
his O
present O
destination O
, O
let O
it O
be O
where O
it O
might O
| | O
and O
painful O
or O
not O
painful O
, O
it O
was O
unquestionably O
right O
to O
make O
her O
understand O
the O
doubts O
that O
existed O
as O
to O
the O
boy's O
well O
- O
being O
, O
in O
order O
that O
she O
might O
avail O
herself O
, O
as O
she O
was O
bound O
to O
do O
, O
of O
her O
access O
to O
the O
only O
person O
who O
could O
explain O
the O
transaction O
. O
Having O
screwed O
her O
courage O
, O
therefore O
, O
to O
the O
strictness O
of O
examination O
necessary O
to O
her O
most O
righteous O
purpose O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
left O
her O
boudoir O
in O
the O
possession O
of O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
, O
and O
repaired O
to O
the O
library O
to O
await O
her O
guest O
. O
Nor O
did O
she O
wait O
long O
. O
Almost O
before O
the O
time O
arrived O
at O
which O
she O
had O
calculated O
that O
the O
carriage O
might O
return O
, O
the O
great O
house O
- O
bell O
gave O
signal O
of O
a O
visiter O
, O
and O
the O
next O
moment O
Martha B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
stood O
before O
her O
. O
The O
two S-CARDINAL
young O
girls O
shook O
hands O
, O
and O
each O
observed O
that O
the O
other O
looked O
paler O
than O
she O
was O
wont O
to O
do O
. O
The O
heart O
of O
Mary S-PERSON
sank O
within O
her O
as O
she O
marked O
the O
expression O
of O
Martha's O
countenance O
. O
Not O
only O
was O
it O
pale O
, O
but O
most O
speakingly O
anxious O
, O
and O
in O
addition O
to O
her O
usual O
shy O
and O
reserved O
manner O
there O
was O
an O
appearance O
of O
uneasiness O
, O
and O
almost O
of O
fear O
, O
as O
she O
thought O
, O
which O
seemed O
to O
tell O
that O
her O
object O
was O
suspected O
. O
Nor O
was O
she O
wrong O
. O
In O
pursuance O
of O
a O
promise O
given O
to O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
Martha S-PERSON
had O
visited O
the O
widow O
Armstrong S-PERSON
, O
and O
the O
intense O
anxiety O
under O
which O
she O
found O
her O
suffering O
respecting O
the O
destination O
of O
her O
boy O
, O
awakened O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
in O
her O
own O
mind O
a O
shadowy O
suspicion O
that O
all O
might O
not O
be O
right O
concerning O
him O
. O
The O
pang O
this O
cost O
her O
was O
terrible O
. O
Good O
and O
kind O
- O
hearted O
as O
she O
was O
, O
there O
was O
no O
strength O
of O
fibre O
in O
Martha's S-PERSON
character O
which O
might O
enable O
her O
to O
brave O
every O
thing O
rather O
than O
remain O
in O
doubt O
. O
She O
loved O
her O
father O
fondly O
, O
but O
she O
feared O
him O
more O
, O
and O
the O
stronger O
her O
suspicions O
grew O
( O
and O
unhappily O
the O
more O
she O
meditated O
the O
more O
they O
strengthened O
) O
, O
the O
less O
power O
she O
felt O
either O
to O
refute O
or O
confirm O
them O
. O
The O
note O
of O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
was O
delivered O
to O
her O
at O
the O
family O
breakfast O
table O
, O
and O
the O
instant O
she O
read O
it O
, O
the O
truth O
suggested O
itself O
to O
her O
mind O
. O
Had O
she O
been O
a O
free O
agent O
, O
the O
wounded O
shrinking O
spirit O
of O
the O
poor O
girl O
would O
have O
certainly O
led O
her O
to O
invent O
some O
excuse O
for O
refusing O
an O
invitation O
so O
full O
of O
terror O
| | O
but O
she O
was O
not O
. O
" O
What's O
that O
about O
, O
Martha S-PERSON
? O
" O
said O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
holding O
out O
his O
hand O
for O
the O
note O
. O
" O
It O
is O
from O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
, O
" O
muttered O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
as O
she O
resigned O
it O
to O
him O
. O
" O
Mercy O
on O
me O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
her O
eldest O
sister O
, O
" O
what O
a O
wonderful O
fancy O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
seems O
to O
have O
taken O
for O
Martha S-PERSON
! O
I O
do O
think O
it O
is O
the O
very O
oddest O
thing O
I O
ever O
heard O
of O
. O
" O
" O
What O
a O
goose O
you O
are O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
not O
to O
understand O
it O
! O
" O
observed O
Miss O
Harriet S-PERSON
, O
the O
second S-ORDINAL
sister O
, O
giving O
at O
the O
same O
time O
a O
very O
significant O
glance O
towards O
her O
brother O
Augustus S-PERSON
. O
" O
But O
good O
gracious O
! O
" O
retorted O
Miss O
Arabella S-PERSON
, O
why O
might O
not O
any O
other O
of O
us O
do O
as O
well O
? O
It O
would O
seem O
so O
much O
more O
natural O
in O
such O
an O
elegant O
and O
fashionable O
girl O
as O
she O
is O
. O
" O
" O
She O
is O
afraid O
of O
us O
, O
Bella S-PERSON
, O
" O
replied O
Miss O
Harriet S-PERSON
, O
tittering O
. O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
not O
only O
read O
the O
note O
, O
but O
contrived O
to O
hear O
all O
that O
his O
two S-CARDINAL
eldest O
daughters O
said O
concerning O
it O
, O
here O
burst O
into O
a O
laugh O
. O
" O
Set O
a O
thief O
to O
catch O
a O
thief O
— O
hey O
! O
Harriet S-PERSON
? O
Come O
Martha S-PERSON
! O
start O
away O
! O
You O
have O
finished O
your O
breakfast O
long O
ago O
. O
I O
won't O
have O
the O
carriage O
kept O
waiting O
. O
" O
" O
Must O
I O
go O
, O
papa O
? O
" O
said O
poor O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
turning O
very O
pale O
. O
" O
Must O
you O
go O
? O
and O
with O
that O
die-away O
look O
too O
? O
Why O
, O
Martha S-PERSON
! O
are O
you O
jealous O
, O
because O
some O
folks O
fancy O
that O
the O
young O
lady O
wants O
to O
make O
friends O
with O
you O
, O
for O
more O
reasons O
than O
one O
? O
" O
" O
I O
would O
a O
great O
deal O
rather O
not O
go O
, O
papa O
! O
" O
replied O
Martha S-PERSON
in O
a O
beseeching O
accent O
. O
" O
Martha S-PERSON
! O
I O
shall O
be O
in O
a O
downright O
passion O
with O
you O
in O
half B-TIME
a I-TIME
minute E-TIME
. O
Upon O
my O
honour O
I O
never O
heard O
any O
thing O
so O
cross-grained O
and O
unsisterly O
in O
my O
life O
. O
Go O
this O
moment O
, O
and O
get O
on O
your O
bonnet O
, O
and O
remember O
if O
you O
please O
, O
from O
first S-ORDINAL
to O
last O
, O
to O
speak O
of O
your O
brother O
as O
a O
sister O
ought O
to O
speak O
. O
And O
if O
she O
hints O
any O
thing O
about O
his O
having O
flirted O
a O
little O
with O
Carry B-PERSON
Thompson E-PERSON
, O
be O
sure O
to O
say O
that O
he O
only O
did O
it O
to O
laugh O
at O
her O
. O
" O
As O
he O
spoke O
these O
words O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
rose O
from O
the O
table O
, O
as O
if O
to O
accelerate O
the O
movement O
which O
was O
to O
send O
her O
off O
. O
Martha S-PERSON
listened O
to O
him O
with O
the O
habitual O
reverence O
which O
she O
ever O
bestowed O
on O
all O
he O
uttered O
| | O
but O
shook O
her O
head O
, O
as O
it O
seemed O
, O
involuntarily O
, O
as O
he O
concluded O
. O
" O
Why O
you O
don't O
mean O
to O
say O
he O
was O
in O
earnest O
, O
you O
good O
- O
for O
- O
nothing O
spiteful O
girl O
! O
" O
cried O
Lady B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
, O
suddenly O
rousing O
herself O
from O
the O
dignified O
apathy O
in O
which O
she O
usually O
indulged O
. O
" O
What O
a O
shame O
! O
" O
cried O
one S-CARDINAL
sister O
. O
" O
That's O
too O
bad O
! O
" O
cried O
the O
other O
. O
" O
Just O
like O
her O

though O

sneered O
Mr. O
Augustus S-PERSON

" O
Hold O
your O
tongues O

all O

Thus O
urged O
, O
thus O
goaded O
to O
the O
interview O
she O
dreaded O
, O
Martha S-PERSON
hastened O
to O
leave O
the O
room O

but O
ere O
she O
passed O
the O
door O
, O
something O
at O
her O
heart O
told O
her O
that O
her O
best O
course O
would O
be O
to O
take O
her O
father O
apart O

tell O
him O
all O

She O
turned O
back O
to O
look O
at O
him O
, O
but O
met O
a O
frown O
so O
strongly O
indicative O
of O
growing O
impatience O
at O
her O
delay O
, O
that O
yielding O
to O
the O
sort O
of O
slavish O
feeling O
in O
which O
she O
had O
been O
nurtured O
, O
she O
hurried O
forward O
to O
obey O
him O

Had O
she O
possessed O
greater O
moral O
courage O
, O
many O
subsequent O
events O
would O
have O
been O
different O

capable O
than O
her O
companion O

begged O
her O
to O
sit O
down O

then O
, O
placing O
herself O
where O
she O

a O
commentary O
on O
what O
she O
might O
induce O
her O
to O
say O

the O
advantage O
of O
watching O
her O
countenance O

pronounced O
in O
a O
voice O
that O
she O
in O
vain O
laboured O

render O

" O
My O

replied O
Martha B-PERSON

, O
in O
a O
voice O
so O
low O

husky O
, O
as O
hardly O
to O
be O
audible O
, O
but O
with O
a O
complexion O
and O
features O
that O
spoke O
so O
plainly O
what O
was O
passing O
in O
her O
heart O
, O
that O
Mary S-PERSON
felt O
ashamed O

so O
distinctly O

the O
poor O

seated O

took O
her O
hand O

not O

I O
honour O

gently O

Had O
you O

Martha S-PERSON

you O

Mary S-PERSON
looked O
at O
her O
with O
surprise O
, O
and O
almost O
with O
terror O

she O
was O
as O
pale O
as O
death O
, O
and O
shook O
, O
as O
she O
stood O
up O
before O
her O
, O
as O
if O
she O
had O
been O
seized O
with O
an O
ague O
- O
fit O

" O
Alas O
, O
Martha S-PERSON
! O
" O
she O
exclaimed O
, O

my O

me O
implore O
you O
to O
examine O
in O
silence O

alone O

the O
question O
of O
right O

wrong O

to O
yourself O
the O
misery O
of O
the O
wretched O
mother O

remember O
that O
yourself O

say O
it O

wring O
both O

yourself O

said O
enough O

destroy O
my O
peace O

the O
miserable O

Without O

an O
answer O
, O
Martha B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
wrapped O
her O
shawl O
about O
her O

to O

door O

the O
vexed O

disappointed O
Mary S-PERSON

who O
had O
gained O
nothing O
from O
this O
painful O
interview O

the O
conviction O
that O
the O
well O
- O
intentioned O
, O

erring O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
was O
as O
much O
persuaded O

unfairly O
dealt O

replied O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
hurrying O
on O
, O
and O
closing O
the O
door O
of O
the O
room O
after O
her O
, O
and O
before O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
could O
reopen O
it O
, O
she O
had O
already O
passed O
through O
the O
hall O
, O
and O
was O
almost O
running O
from O
the O
house O
. O
as O
to O
return O
unattended O
and O
on O
foot O
. O
" O
Perfect O
love O
casteth O
out O
fear O

" O
and O
perfect O
fear O
may O
perhaps O
petrify O
the O
heart O
into O
a O
sort O
of O
unstruggling O
desperation O
| | O
but O
a O
union O
of O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
reduces O
the O
mind O
to O
a O
state O
of O
slavery O
the O
most O
abject O
, O
leaving O
no O
strength O
whereby O
any O
healthful O
moral O
feeling O
can O
be O
sustained O
. O
Martha's O
whole O
care O
, O
on O
returning O
home O
, O
was O
to O
satisfy O
her O
father O
that O
nothing O
particular O
had O
passed O
in O
her O
interview O
with O
the O
heiress O

and O
, O
unfortunately O
for O
all O
parties O
, O
she O
succeeded O
. O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
, O
meanwhile O
, O
mounted O
a O
little O
pony O
phaeton O
with O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
, O
and O
with O
a O
heavy O
heart O
proceeded O
to O
Hoxley B-FAC
- I-FAC
lane E-FAC
. O
But O
, O
painful O
as O
was O
her O
errand O
, O
her O
condition O
was O
a O
far O
happier O
one O
than O
that O
of O
Martha B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON

for O
in O
her O
there O
was O
no O
mixture O
of O
motives O
to O
paralyze O
every O
word O
and O
act O
. O
Her O
kind O
heart O
sought O
and O
found O
counsel O
in O
her O
sound O
and O
upright O
judgment O
, O
and O
, O
sustained O
by O
it O
, O
she O
executed O
her O
task O
without O
shrinking O
. O
A O
little O
reflection O
on O
the O
subject O
convinced O
her O
that O
it O
was O
now O
become O
her O
duty O
to O
confess O
to O
her O
poor O
client O
, O
not O
only O
that O
her O
exertions O
to O
discover O
the O
abode O
of O
Michael S-PERSON
had O
been O
unsuccessful O
, O
but O
that O
she O
began O
to O
fear O
that O
there O
must O
be O
some O
unpleasant O
reason O
for O
the O
difficulties O
thrown O
in O
the O
way O
of O
obtaining O
the O
information O
she O
had O
sought O
. O
It O
required O
some O
courage O
to O
utter O
this O
| | O
but O
when O
it O
wasdone O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
was O
surprised O
to O
perceive O
that O
its O
effect O
, O
both O
upon O
the O
mother O
and O
son O
was O
very O
trifling O
. O
Having O
candidly O
stated O
her O
fears O
, O
she O
remained O
silent O
, O
the O
eyes O
of O
both O
being O
fixed O
upon O
her O
with O
a O
sort O
of O
quiet O
hopelessness O
that O
was O
perhaps O
more O
painful O
to O
contemplate O
than O
more O
vehement O
demonstrations O
of O
grief O
. O
" O
Our O
thanks O
are O
not O
the O
less O
due O
to O
you O
, O
ma'am O
, O
" O
said O
the O
widow O
gently O
, O
" O
and O
don't O
vex O
your O
kind O
heart O
by O
thinking O
that O
we O
are O
disappointed O
. O
Edward S-PERSON
and O
I O
guessed O
true O
from O
almost O
the O
first S-ORDINAL

that O
is O
, O
from O
when O
he O
was O
taken O
off O
without O
bidding O
us O
good O

Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
is O
known O
better O
by O
his O
mill O
people O
, O
ma'am O
, O
than O
by O
the O
great O
gentry O
that O
turns O
their O
eyes O
away O
from O
labour O
and O
sorrow O
, O
to O
revel O
and O
grow O
fat O
upon O
our O
graves O

You O
would O
never O
be O
like O
to O
hear O
the O
truth O
from O
them O

and O
I O
am O
told O
that O
even O
now O
, O
the O
country O
round O
rings O
with O
praises O
of O
Sir O
Matthew's S-PERSON
goodness O
to O
Michael S-PERSON

' O
Tis O
bitter O
to O
hear O
it O
. O
But O
it O
is O
God's O
will O
our O
portion O
should O
be O
bitter O
here O

He O
has O
power O

make O
it O
up O

us O
hereafter O

it O
is O
there O

our O
hope O

should O

the O
power O

me O
, O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
how O
did O
you O
get O
on O
at O
school O

- O
day O
? O
" O
" O
Every O
body O
was O
kind O

the O
boy O

well O

dear O
boy O

Mrs. O
Armstrong S-PERSON
? O
" O
" O
He O
does O
indeed O
, O
ma'am O
! O

I O
could O
almost O
fancy O
that O
he O
looked O
better O
in O
health O
already O
, O
for O
having O
left O
the O
mill O

replied O
the O
widow O
. O
" O
And O
I O
feel O
better O
, O
" O
said O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
looking O
at O
his O
mother O
with O
his O
soft O
thoughtful O
eyes O
, O
" O

I O
don't O
think O
that O
it O
would O
be O
impossible O

me O

well O
again O

" O
" O
My O
boy O
! O
my O
boy O
! O
" O
cried O
the O
poor O
cripple O
, O
raising O
herself O
in O
her O
bed O
, O
and O
throwing O
her O
arms O
around O
him O

" O
Should O
I O
dare O
to O
complain O
of O
any O
thing O

that O
were O
possible O

But O
oh O
! O
Teddy S-PERSON
! O
wouldn't O
he O
have O
given O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
his O
little O
hands O
to O
see O
it O
? O
" O
This O
appeal O
, O
which O
in O
truth O
only O
echoed O
the O
thoughts O
of O
his O
own O
heart O
, O
overthrew O
all O
the O
courage O
of O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
and O
his O
tears O
again O
flowed O
as O
fast O
as O
those O
of O
his O
poor O
mother O

a O
renewal O
of O
weakness O
of O
which O
they O
might O
both O
have O
been O
still O
more O
ashamed O

were O

not O
perceived O
that O
neither O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON

her O
old O
friend O
had O
dry O
eyes O

Mary S-PERSON
, O
however O
, O
was O
too O
wise O
to O
let O
this O
last O

" O
This O
dear O
boy O

" O
said O

has O
said O
that O
which O
ought O
to O
give O
us O
all O
courage O

I O
can O
hardly O
tell O
you O
the O
delightful O
feeling O
which O
the O
hope O
of O
his O
restoration O
to O
health O
would O
give O
me O

would O
repay O
me O
a B-CARDINAL
thousand E-CARDINAL

pain O

have O
suffered O

Let O
us O
fix O
our O
thoughts O
on O
this O
hope O

trust O
me O

shall O
be O
realized O

medical O
skill O

kind O
treatment O

with O

assurance O

left O
them O

any O
earthly O
promise O
could O

healed O
the O
anguish O

the O
mother's O
heart O

her O
two S-CARDINAL
children O
were O
so O
twined O

twisted O
together O
in O
her O
thoughts O

meditating O
upon O
her O
hopes O
for O
Edward S-PERSON
inevitably O
brought O
her O
terrors O
for O
Michael S-PERSON
before O
her O

it O

with O
a O
fitful O
sort O
of O
satisfaction O
that O
the O
boy O
dwelt O
upon O
his O
anticipations O

being O
useful O

pursuing O
their O
usual O
morning O
occupations O
in O
the O
boudoir O

servant O
announced O
that O
a O
lady O

gentleman O
were O
in O
the O
drawing O

room O

Had O
the O
announcement O
been O
of O
a O
gentleman O
alone O
, O
Mary's S-PERSON
thoughts O
would O
have O
instantly O
suggested O
Mr. O
Bell S-PERSON
, O
for O
they O
had O
been O
fixed O
upon O
him O

hope O

his O
coming O

through O
both O
the B-DATE
preceding I-DATE
days E-DATE

the O
mention O
of O
the O
lady O
puzzled O
her O
. O
Nevertheless O
the O
gentleman O
was O
Mr. O
Bell S-PERSON

no O
other O

and O
the O
frank O

simple O
kindness O
with O
which O
he O
said O

led O
the O

forward O

wanted O
my O

rendered O
the O
introduction O
as O
agreeable O

it O
was O
unexpected O

take O
this O
good O
little O
woman O
into O
the O
committee O

she O
has O
probably O
more O
practical O
knowledge O
of O
the O
subject O

were O
discussing O

we O
met O

any O

lady O

could O
meet O
with O

" O
Equally O
cordial O

sincere O
was O
the O
welcome O
Mary S-PERSON
gave O
to O
her O
new O
friends O

sufficed O

make O
them O
happy O

long O
morning O

passed O
together O
would O
have O
been O
one O
of O
great O
enjoyment O

they O
were O
all O
too O
much O
in O
earnest O
to O
be O
called O
happy O

dwelling O
upon O
the O
frightful O
subject O
to O

their O
thoughts O

turned O

past O
in O
struggling O
to O
assuage O
the O
misery O
around O
them O
, O
and O
in O
battling O
with O
the O
horrid O
principles O
which O
produced O
it O

the O
more O
deeply O
did O
she O
feel O
that O
she O

too O
, O
was O
called O
upon O
to O
labour O
in O
the O
same O
thorny O
vineyard O

Yet O
terrible O
as O
were O
the O
subjects O
they O
discussed O
, O
and O
sad O
as O
was O
the O
conviction O
that O
no O
power O
less O
mighty O
than O
that O
of O
the O
law O
could O
redress O
the O
evils O
they O
deplored O
, O
there O
was O
still O
something O
inexpressibly O
soothing O
to O
her O
feelings O
, O
in O
finding O
herself O
thus O
in O
intimate O
relation O
with O
persons O
who O
comprehended O
and O
shared O
in O
the O
sentiments O
which O
had O
become O
so O
essentially O
a O
part O
of O
herself O
. O
Though O
her O
conscience O
had O
told O
her O
, O
from O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
moment O
her O
attention O
had O
been O
called O
to O
the O
subject O
, O
that O
it O
was O
her O
duty O
not O
to O
turn O
away O
from O
it O
, O
she O
had O
hitherto O
met O
little O
but O
opposition O
from O
those O
around O
her O
, O
and O
though O
steadfast O
and O
firm O
in O
purpose O
, O
she O
had O
often O
felt O
heavy O
in O
spirit O
from O
knowing O
herself O
to O
be O
alone O
, O
when O
she O
so O
much O
wanted O
assistance O
and O
support O
. O
This O
oppressive O
loneliness O
she O
could O
never O
suffer O
from O
again O
, O
as O
long O
as O
Mr. O
Bell S-PERSON
and O
his O
excellent O
wife O
were O
within O
her O
reach O
, O
and O
fervently O
did O
she O
bless O
the O
courage O
which O
had O
led O
her O
to O
their O
dwelling O
. O
Tidings O
of O
poor O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
however O
, O
there O
were O
none O
. O
Mr. O
Bell S-PERSON
had O
sought O
information O
concerning O
him O
wherever O
he O
thought O
it O
possible O
to O
obtain O
them O
, O
but O
he O
had O
learnt O
nothing O
. O
Nevertheless O
he O
declared O
himself O
by O
no O
means O
satisfied O
that O
the O
boy O
might O
not O
be O
at O
some O
one O
of O
the O
Bastille S-FAC

like O
establishments O

he O
had O
applied O

know O
them O

know O
me O

well O

said O
, O
" O
for O
me O

be O
recognised O
by O
any O
one O
as O
a O
friend O
of O
mine O
, O
I O
still O
think O
the O
chances O
would O
be O
greatly O
in O
favour O
of O
our O
finding O
the O
boy O
at O
some O
of O
the O
noted O
apprenticing O
establishments O

I O
have O
named O

, O
in O
truth O
, O
I O

Mary S-PERSON

Mr. O

methinks O
I O
could O
carry O
through O

the O

little O
Michael S-PERSON

with O
a O
degree O

Where O
such O

only O

first S-ORDINAL
place O
she O
was O
closeted O
for O
at B-TIME
least I-TIME
two I-TIME
hours E-TIME
after O
breakfast O
with O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
, O
and O
, O
whatever O
might O
be O
the O
subject O
of O
their O
conversation O
, O
it O
appeared O
to O
end O
satisfactorily O
, O
for O
when O
it O
was O
over O
Mary S-PERSON
embraced O
her O
old O
friend O
very O
cordially O
, O
saying O
, O
" O
I O
feel O
more O
grateful O
, O
much O
more O
grateful O
, O
than O
I O
have O
words O
to O
express O
, O
nurse O
Tremlett S-PERSON
, O
and O
never O
shall O
I O
forget O
your O
kindness O
to O
me O
! O
" O
thence O
to O
pay O
a O
farewell O
visit O
to O
Mrs. O
Armstrong S-PERSON
| | O
and O
here O
it O
was O
evident O
that O
, O
however O
wild O
the O
projects O
might O
be O
which O
the O
heiress O
had O
conceived O
, O
she O
knew O
how O
to O
be O
discreetly O
silent O
concerning O
them O
, O
for O
after O
bestowing O
upon O
the O
widow O
a O
gratuity O
sufficient O
to O
supply O
all O
her O
wants O
for O
a O
longer O
time O
than O
she O
purposed O
to O
be O
absent O
, O
she O
took O
leave O
of O
her O
, O
saying O
, O
" O
You O
will O
not O
see O
me O
again O
Mrs. O
Armstrong S-PERSON
for O
a B-DATE
week E-DATE
or O
more O
, O
I O
am O
engaged O
to O
go O
from O
home O
for O
that O
time O
| | O
but O
I O
shall O
take O
care O
that O
Edward S-PERSON
shall O
receive O
as O
much O
attention O
at O
the O
school O
as O
if O
I O
were O
at O
home O
. O
Be O
sure O
also O
, O
that O
my O
absence O
will O
not O
make O
me O
the O
less O
mindful O
of O
Michael S-PERSON
. O
Neither O
at O
home O
or O
abroad O
shall O
I O
cease O
to O
employ O
every O
means O
in O
my O
power O
to O
obtain O
intelligence O
concerning O
him O
. O
" O
To O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
whom O
she O
visited O
at O
the O
school O
, O
she O
gave O
the O
same O
assurance O
, O
adding O
an O
earnest O
injunction O
that O
he O
should O
keep O
in O
mind O
the O
necessity O
of O
exerting O
himself O
, O
both O
for O
the O
industrious O
prosecution O
of O
his O
studies O
, O
and O
the O
not O
less O
important O
regulation O
of O
his O
mind O
on O
the O
subject O
of O
his O
brother's O
absence O
, O
the O
welfare O
of O
his O
mother O
greatly O
depending O
upon O
both O
. O
Weakness O
of O
every O
kind O
seemed O
to O
vanish O
before O
the O
powerful O
stimulant O
thus O
offered O
, O
and O
she O
left O
her O
little O
protégé O
comforted O
and O
invigorated O
by O
the O
belief O
that O
he O
had O
a O
great O
duty O
to O
perform O
, O
and O
that O
his O
mother O
was O
the O
object O
of O
it O
. O
The O
preparations O
for O
her O
own O
and O
her O
friends' O
convenience O
during O
the O
journey O
were O
very O
simple O
, O
but O
they O
puzzled O
her O
maid O
considerably O
. O
First S-ORDINAL
, O
it O
was O
so O
very O
odd O
that O
she O
should O
be O
going O
out O
upon O
a O
visit O
and O
take O
absolutely O
no O
dinner O
dresses O
at O
all O
with O
her O
| | O
and O
secondly O
, O
it O
was O
, O
if O
possible O
, O
odder O
still O
, O
that O
she O
should O
not O
take O
her O
. O
But O
Mary S-PERSON
listened O
to O
all O
the O
hints O
and O
innuendoes O
to O
which O
these O
feelings O
gave O
rise O
with O
a O
sort O
of O
gentle O
indifference O
, O
which O
was O
doubtless O
very O
provoking O
, O
till O
at O
length O
she O
was O
induced O
to O
damp O
the O
curiosity O
, O
which O
she O
feared O
might O
prove O
inconveniently O
active O
during O
her O
absence O
, O
by O
saying O
, O
" O
I O
am O
going O
to O
visit O
the O
family O
of O
a O
clergyman O
, O
Morgan S-PERSON
, O
and O
, O
as O
much O
dress O
will O
not O
be O
necessary O
, O
I O
shall O
not O
want O
you O
. O
" O
This O
was O
perfectly O
satisfactory O
. O
" O
A O
clergyman's O
family O
, O
where O
much O
dress O
would O
not O
be O
necessary O
, O
was O
where O
the O
lady's O
maid O
never O
did O
nor O
never O
could O
want O
to O
go O
. O
" O
Nothing O
could O
have O
been O
more O
judicious O
than O
these O
explanatory O
words O
. O
They O
accorded O
perfectly O
with O
the O
report O
of O
the O
servants O
who O
attended O
the O
carriage O
, O
and O
so O
completely O
satisfied O
the O
household O
, O
that O
, O
though O
it O
was O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
absence O
of O
so O
long O
duration O
that O
she O
had O
made O
from O
her O
home O
since O
she O
became O
mistress O
of O
it O
, O
it O
fortunately O
led O
to O
no O
gossipings O
whatever O
. O
We O
must O
not O
pause O
to O
describe O
the O
pleasant O
sociable O
evening O
passed O
by O
our O
travellers O
at O
the O
house O
of O
Mr. O
Bell S-PERSON
, O
nor O
even O
relate O
all O
that O
was O
said O
in O
the O
course O
of O
it O
, O
concerning O
the O
expedition O
they O
were O
about O
to O
undertake O
. O
Every O
instruction O
, O
every O
hint O
which O
Mr. O
Bell S-PERSON
believed O
might O
be O
useful O
, O
he O
gave O
clearly O
and O
succinctly O
, O
and O
not O
a O
word O
of O
it O
was O
lost O
upon O

SHE O
APPROACHES O
THE O

VALLEY O
. O
It O
was O
about B-TIME
nine I-TIME
o'clock E-TIME
on O
a O
bright O
autumn O
morning O
that O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
and O
her O
faithful O
nurse O
mounted O
into O
a O
lumbering O
six S-CARDINAL
- O
inside O
vehicle O
, O
bound O
for O
— O
. O
Their O
two S-CARDINAL
small O
trunks O
, O
with O
" O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
, O
passenger O
, O
" O
modestly O
written O
on O
both O
, O
were O
safely O
lodged O
on O
the O
top O
| | O
Mr. O
Bell S-PERSON
gave O
them O
a O
silent O
blessing O
and O
a O
silent O
nod O
| | O
the O
horseboy O
vociferated O
" O
all O
right O
, O
" O
and O
the O
richest O
young O
lady O
in O
Lancashirc S-GPE
rolled O
off O
, O
very O
literally O
in O
search O
of O
adventures O
. O
The O
novelty O
of O
her O
situation O
, O
and O
of O
her O
sensations O
of O
every O
kind O
, O
the O
unceremonious O
examination O
bestowed O
upon O
her O
by O
a O
smart O
young O
clerk O
who O
sat O
opposite O
, O
the O
anxious O
look O
of O
Mrs. O
Tremlett's S-PERSON
usually O
tranquil O
face O
, O
and O
the O
consciousness O
that O
the O
enterprise O
she O
was O
upon O
must O
even O
by O
herself O
be O
characterized O
as O
wildly O
extravagant O
, O
if O
not O
carried O
through O
with O
much O
steady O
courage O
and O
discretion O
, O
altogether O
produced O
a O
feeling O
of O
oppression O
on O
her O
heart O
that O
very O
nearly O
overcame O
her O
. O
" O
Am O
I O
acting O
rightly O
in O
thus O
exposing O
myself O
? O
" O
was O
the O
question O
that O
her O
startled O
nerves O
suggested O
: O
and O
had O
her O
conscience O
been O
unable O
to O
answer O
it O
boldly O
and O
promptly O
, O
her O
condition O
would O
have O
been O
really O
pitiable O
. O
Happily O
, O
however O
, O
this O
was O
not O
the O
case O
. O
There O
was O
some O
feminine O
timidity O
about O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton E-PERSON
, O
but O
not O
an O
atom O
of O
false O
shame O
or O
affectation O
of O
any O
kind O
. O
" O
Yes O
! O
— O
I O
am O
right O
! O
" O
was O
the O
answer O
recorded O
on O
her O
heart O
of O
hearts O
, O
" O
and O
shame O
to O
me O
if O
I O
shrink O
at O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
step O
, O
for O
no O
better O
reason O
than O
because O
the O
dust O
flies O
, O
and O
a O
vulgar O
young O
man O
stares O
me O
in O
the O
face O
. O
" O
From O
that O
moment O
Mary S-PERSON
recoiled O
no O
more O
| | O
and O
a O
little O
resolute O
meditation O
on O
her O
object O
, O
and O
of O
the O
strength O
demanded O
to O
obtain O
it O
, O
so O
effectually O
restored O
her O
usual O
self O
- O
possession O
, O
that O
she O
looked O
round O
upon O
her O
fellow O
- O
travellers O
with O
as O
little O
embarrassment O
as O
if O
she O
had O
been O
used O
to O
travel O
in O
public O
all O
her O
life O
, O
nodded O
to O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
with O
an O
encouraging O
smile O
, O
and O
thought O
how O
very O
silly O
people O
were O
who O
fancied O
that O
every O
thing O
unusual O
must O
of O
necessity O
be O
terrible O
. O
" O
Are O
you O
going O
all O
the O
way O
to O
— O
, O
miss O
? O
" O
said O
a O
goodnatured O
- O
looking O
woman O
who O
sat O
bodkin O
between O
the O
smart O
clerk O
and O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
. O
" O
Yes O
, O
ma'am O
, O
I O
am O
, O
" O
replied O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
civilly O
. O
The O
good O
- O
natured O
woman O
twisted O
herself O
round O
to O
reconnoitre O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
. O
" O
Your O
mamma O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
my O
dear O
? O
" O
" O
No O
, O
ma'am O
— O
the O
lady O
is O
a O
friend O
! O
" O
" O
Oh O
! O
I O
ask O
your O
pardon O
| | O
you O
are O
so O
very O
much O
alike O
made O
me O
say O
it O
. O
" O
Mary S-PERSON
bowed O
— O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
smiled O
. O
The O
goodnatured O
- O
looking O
woman O
persevered O
in O
the O
same O
train O
of O
pertinent O
observation O
, O
sometimes O
addressed O
to O
one S-CARDINAL
passenger O
, O
and O
sometimes O
to O
another O
, O
so O
as O
to O
prevent O
the O
party O
from O
sinking O
into O
total O
silence O
, O
which O
might O
otherwise O
, O
perhaps O
, O
have O
happened O
. O
But O
Mary S-PERSON
bore O
her O
share O
in O
this O
trifling O
annoyance O
with O
perfect O
good O
- O
humour O
| | O
and O
when O
at O
length O
they O
arrived O
at O
— O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
asked O
her O
in O
rather O
piteous O
accents O
, O
the O
moment O
they O
were O
alone O
together O
, O
whether O
she O
did O
not O
feel O
dreadfully O
worn O
out O
, O
she O
cheerfully O
replied O
, O
" O
Not O
the O
least O
in O
the O
world O
, O
my O
dear O
friend O
. O
" O
" O
Thank O
God O
! O
" O
replied O
the O
old O
woman O
, O
fervently O
, O
" O
I O
know O
you O
do O
so O
hate O
to O
be O
bothered O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
that O
I O
was O
afraid O
that O
old O
fool O
would O
put O
you O
out O
of O
all O
patience O
. O
" O
" O
Times O
are O
altered O
with O
me O
now O
, O
nurse O

, O
" O
replied O
Mary S-PERSON

" O
I O
have O
left O
off O
living O
for O
myself O
, O
and O
I O
feel O
my O
temper O
improving O
already O
by O
it O
. O
Now O
, O
then O
, O
ring O
the O
bell O

give O
your O
orders O

remember O
, O
nurse O

you O
are O
the O
great O
lady O
, O
and O
must O
order O
every O
thing O
. O
" O
Encouraged O
by O
this O
cheerful O
submission O
to O
circumstances O
, O
which O
was O
in O
truth O
somewhat O
more O
than O
she O
expected O
, O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
began O
to O
think O
that O
Mary S-PERSON
might O
indeed O
prove O
capable O
of O
carrying O
through O
the O
scheme O
, O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
sketch O
of O
which O
had O
appeared O
so O
wild O
, O
that O
nothing O
short O
of O
a O
devotion O
to O
her O
will O
, O
which O
knew O
no O
bounds O
, O
could O
have O
surmounted O
her O
averseness O
to O
it O
. O
" O
My O
darling O
child O
! O
" O
cried O
the O
old O
woman O
, O
looking O
at O
her O
with O
equal O
admiration O
and O
delight O
, O
" O
your O
mind O
is O
as O
strong O
as O
your O
heart O
is O
tender O

I O
again O
oppose O

" O
noiseless O
children O

admirable O
machine O

at O
them O

the O

The O

seemed O
to O
weigh O
upon O
her O

as O
well O

watched O

" O
On O
entering O
the O
second S-ORDINAL

Mary S-PERSON
felt O
, O
as O
she O
expected O

that O
her O
bodily O
strength O
was O
quite O
sufficient O
to O
sustain O
her O

She O
had O
not O
habituated O
herself O

in O
action O

was O
for O
a O

overwhelming O

it O
was O
past O

the O
terrible O
" O

could O
not O
come O
again O

far O
from O
shrinking O
from O
the O
task O
she O
had O
imposed O
upon O
herself O

she O
left O
the O
enormous O

after O
having O
perseveringly O
mounted O
to O
its O
summit O

with O
the O
satisfactory O
conviction O
that O
she O
should O
not O

enterprise O
either O

Good O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
, O
however O
, O
still O
felt O
less O
confident O
upon O
the O

no O

no O

us O
cogitate O

the O
likeliest O
way O

turning O
all O
such O
visits O

account O

" O
This O
cogitation O
led O
them O
both O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
it O
might O
, O
for O
the O
sake O
of O

be O
as O
well O

take O
the O
landlord's O
recommendation O

another O

usually O
pointed O
out O

the O
attention O

then O
to O
consult O
the O
ivory O

venture O
upon O
a O
visit O
to O
the O
only O

as O
notorious O
for O
the O
reception O

In O
pursuance O
of O
this O
plan O
, O
the O
waiter O
was O
again O
interrogated O
when O
he O
attended O
the O
ladies O
at O
their O
luncheon O
, O
and O
again O
he O
brought O
a O
written O
address O
from O
his O

accompanied O
by O
a O
message O
intimating O
that O
the O
following O
morning O
being O

the O

might O
have O
the O
advantage O

visiting O

school O

for O

he O
had O

to O
walk O
in O

presently O
found O
that O
the O
routine O
of O
exhibition O
was O
precisely O
similar O
to O
that O
of O
the O
morning O

It O
struck O
them O
both O
, O
however O
, O
that O
if O
possible O
, O
the O
children O
looked O
more O
worn O
and O
weary O
, O
more O
miserably O
lean O
, O
and O
more O
frightfully O
pallid O
, O
than O
those O

had O
seen O
before O

Mary S-PERSON

not O

wanted O
a B-DATE

watched O

being O
thus O
roused O
again O
, O
stumbled O
onwards O
, O
leaving O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON

Mary S-PERSON
alike O
undeceived O
as O
to O
the O
humanity O
of O
instituting O
a O
school O
to O
be O
carried O
on O
under O
such O
regulations O

They O
determined O
, O
however O
, O
to O
witness O
with O
their O
own O
eyes O
the O
operation O
of O
teaching O
children O

Mr. O

idle O

ungrateful O

" O
But O
at O
this O
moment O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
and O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
appeared O
in O
sight O
, O
and O
in O
a O
voice O
suddenly O
changed O
from O
reprobation O
into O
drawling O
softness O
, O
he O
went O
on O
, O
" O
Come O

Him O

early O

late O

hear O
His O

sing O
His O
praise O

" O
Here O
he O
stopped O
, O
and O
bowing O
to O
the O
ladies O
offered O
to O
lead O
them O
to O
a O
place O
where O
they O
might O
be O
well O
accommodated O
for O
the O
exhortation O
and O
and O
prayer O
, O
and O
for O
hearing O
the O
children O
also O
, O
if O
they O
wished O
it O
. O
As O
soon O
as O
they O
had O
entered O
the O
sort O
of O
pew O
to O
which O
Mr. O
Tomlins S-PERSON
led O
them O
, O
the O
twenty S-CARDINAL
or O
thirty S-CARDINAL
miserable O
- O
looking O
children O
who O
were O
assembled O
in O
the O
room O
were O
called O
upon O
by O
a O
loud O
word O
of O
command O
to O
" O
Kneel O
! O
" O
and O
down O
they O
tumbled O
, O
the O
elder O
ones O
in O
several O
instances O
taking O
the O
little O
creatures O
already O
asleep O
beside O
them O
, O
and O
placing O
them O
on O
the O
floor O
as O
nearly O
as O
they O
could O
in O
the O
attitude O
commanded O
. O
The O
sonorous O
voice O
of O
Mr. O
Joseph B-PERSON
Tomlins E-PERSON
was O
then O
heard O
pronouncing O
an O
exhortation O
, O
intended O
to O
show O
that O
obedience O
to O
their O
earthly O
masters O
was O
the O
only O
way O
of O
saving O
children O
from O
the O
eternal O
burning O
, O
prepared O
for O
those O
who O
were O
disobedient O
, O
in O
the O
world O
to O
come O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
as O
she O
looked O
earnestly O
round O
upon O
every O
child O
present O
, O
greatly O
doubted O
if O
there O
was O
one O
sufficiently O
awake O
to O
listen O
to O
this O
| | O
and O
in O
her O
heart O
she O
blessed O
the O
heaviness O
which O
saved O
them O
from O
hearing O
the O
mercy O
of O
their O
Maker O
blasphemed O
. O
A O
prayer O
followed O
this O
exhortation O
, O
as O
little O
like O
what O
a O
prayer O
ought O
to O
be O
, O
as O
was O
the O
preparation O
of O
the O
little O
congregation O
who O
listened O
to O
it O
for O
bearing O
part O
in O
a O
religious O
ceremony O
. O
Still O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton E-PERSON
waited O
to O
the O
end O
, O
nor O
left O
her O
station O
till O
the O
nominal O
business O
of O
instruction O
had O
proceeded O
sufficiently O
to O
convince O
her O
that O
poor O
Sophy B-PERSON
Drake's E-PERSON
account O
was O
strictly O
true O
when O
she O
said O
" O
keeping O
our O
eyes O
open O
Sundays O
wasn't O
possible O

they O
didn't O
strap O
us O
. O
" O
The O
children O
were O
not O
strapped O
, O
and O
consequently O
they O
were O
, O
with O
very O
few O
exceptions O
, O
literally O
fast O
asleep O
during O
the B-TIME
hour I-TIME
and I-TIME
half E-TIME
that O
this O
ostentatious O
form O
of O
instruction O
was O
going O
on O
. O
Unwilling O
to O
attract O
more O
notice O
than O
was O
necessary O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
and O
her O
companion O
remained O
till O
the O
drowsy O
tribe O
were O
roused O
, O
awakened O
, O
and O
dismissed O
by O
the O
loud O
voice O
of O
Mr. O
Joseph B-PERSON
Tomlins E-PERSON
, O
and O
then O
they O
also O
slipped O
away O
, O
regained O
the O
carriage O
that O
waited O
for O
them O
, O
and O
returned O
to O
— O
. O
" O
Now O
then O
, O
" O
said O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
as O
their O
one S-CARDINAL
horse O
dragged O
them O
deliberately O
along O
, O
" O
now O
then O
, O
dear O
Tremlett S-PERSON
, O
our O
search O
must O
really O
begin O
. O
As O
soon O
as O
we O
have O
breakfasted O
we O
will O
set O
off O
in O
this O

equipage O
for O

within O

morning's O
drive O

And O
how O
shall O
you O
endeavour O
to O
gain O
admittance O

dear O

" O
demanded O
her O
friend O
. O
" O
As O
we O
did O
yesterday S-DATE
— O
merely O
stating O
that O

are O
strangers O

travelling O

who O
are O
desirous O
of O
seeing O
the O
factories O

replied O
Mary S-PERSON

" O
But O
you O
don't O
expect O
to O
get O
in O

my O
dear O

you O
? O

after O
all O
Mr. O
Bell S-PERSON
told O
you O
about O
apprentices O
! O

exclaimed O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
. O
" O
Probably O
not O

was O
the O
answer O

in O
that O

" O
You O
are O
really O
in O
earnest O

, O
Miss O
Mary S-PERSON
? O
" O
rejoined O
her O
friend O
in O
an O
accent O
which O
betrayed O
some O
nervousness O
. O
" O
You O
really O
mean O
to O
do O
all O
you O
said O
when O
we O
were O
shut O
up O
together O

" O
" O
Most O
certainly O
I O
do O

" O
replied O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
, O
gravely O
. O
" O
Did O
you O
suppose O
I O
was O
jesting O

in O
what O
I O
then O
said O
to O
you O

Not O
jesting O

Miss O
Mary S-PERSON

— O
No O
, O
certainly O
, O
not O
jesting O

Only O
I O
thought O
that O
may O
be O
after O
a O
little O
more O
thinking O
about O
it O
you O
might O
change O
your O
mind O

" O
" O
You O
do O
not O

Mary S-PERSON

with O
vexation O

" O
You O
do O
not O

" O
Do O
not O
say O
so O
, O
dearest O

the O
old O
woman O
with O
emotion O

" O
I O
do O
understand O

Their O

they O
both O
expected O

were O
told O

having O
nothing O

retreated O

advanced O

somewhat O
fearful O

their O
having O
taken O
so O
much O

excite O

considerably O
greater O

had O
little O
more O
time O
on O
their O
return O

sufficed O
for O
securing O
places O
in O
a O
cross-country O
coach O
for O
the O
morrow O

would O

again O
booked O
their O
places O

prepared O
their O

do O
you O
remember O

, O
among O
all O
the O

mentioned O
here O

was O
the O
one O
Mr. O

declared O
that O
he O
considered O
as O
the O
most O
likely O
for O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
to O
have O
selected O
, O
if O
his O
purpose O

up O

me O

the O
reply O

" O
Never O
mind O
that O

is O
not O
getting O

up O

you O
remember O
the O
name O

dwelt O
upon O

I O
dare O
say O
I O

to O
hear O
it O

up O

Mary S-PERSON

turned O
to O
her O
tablets O

read O
the O
names O

the O
descriptions O

reached O
the O
last O
in O
the O
list O
that O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
again O
spoke O
, O

she O
exclaimed O
promptly O
, O
" O
That O
is O
it O
, O

I O
am O
quite O
sure O

' O
I O
will O
bet O
ten S-CARDINAL
to O
one O

said O
, O
' O
that O
if O
Sir O

has O
been O
for O
putting O
the O
boy O
out O
of O
sight O

where O
he O
will O
have O

' O
Those O
were O
his O
words O
, O
Miss O
Mary S-PERSON
— O
I O
could O
quite O
swear O
it O
. O
" O
" O
I O
was O
pretty O
sure O
of O
it O
before O
, O
nurse O
Tremlett S-PERSON
, O
but O
now O
no O
doubt O
can O
possibly O
remain O

Hear O
me O
, O
then O
, O
my O
dear O
kind O
friend O
, O
and O
tell O
me O
truly O
if O
I O
am O
right O
or O
wrong O

I O
settled O
last B-TIME
night E-TIME
, O
nurse O

to O
set O
off O

visit O
all O
these O
factories O
exactly O
in O
the O
order O
in O
which O
they O
are O
here O
set O
down O

But O
, O
after O
I O
went O
to O
bed O
, O
it O
struck O
me O
that O
it O
would O
be O
surely O
better O
to O
begin O
with O
the O
place O
pointed O
out O
by O
our O
good O
friend O
as O
the O
most O
likely O
to O
afford O
success O
. O
I O
like O
the O
business O
quite O
as O
little O
as O
you O
do O
, O
nurse O
, O
and O
would O
gladly O
shorten O
it O
, O
if O
possible O
. O
" O
" O
But O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
won't O
the O
stage O
we O
are O
going O
in O
take O
us O
the O
wrong O
way O
? O
" O
" O
A O
little O
round O
about O
— O
but O
I O
see O
no O
objection O
in O
that O

we O
have O
no O
particular O
wish O
, O
you O
know O
, O
to O
have O
our O
course O
traced O

off O
in O
one S-CARDINAL
direction O
, O
when O
our O
purpose O
is O
to O
take O
another O
, O
must O
go O
far O
towards O
preventing O
it O
. O
So O
that O
you O
see O
we O
have O
no O
immediate O
change O
to O
make O
, O
and O
you O
have O
only O
to O
get O
up O

eat O
your O
breakfast O
in O
time O

the O
experiment O

over O

" O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton E-PERSON
was O
quite O
correct O
in O
her O
geography O

the O
place O
to O
which O
the O
coach O
conveyed O

at O
about O
the O

distance O
from O

from O

, O
without O
making O
any O
further O
inquiries O
concerning O
that O
mysterious O
spot O

which O
indeed O
the O
memoranda O
received O
from O
Mr. O

quite O
unnecessary O

convey O
them O

every O

offered O
public O
accommodation O
so O
poor O

miserable O
looking O

them O
almost O
afraid O
to O
enter O

Their O
driver O
, O

, O
soon O
drew O
up O

upon O
Mrs. O

inquiring O
if O
it O

only O
one O
that O

courageously O

an O
encouraging O

sitting O

spirited O
Mrs. O

half O
frightened O
by O

replied O
the O
woman O
, O
looking O
most O
alarmingly O
sulky O
. O
Had O
the O
last O
been O
addressed O
to O
herself O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton E-PERSON
would O
have O
thought O
it O
one O
of O
the O
duties O
imposed O
by O
her O
pilgrimage O
to O
endure O
it O

, O
as O
it O
was O
, O
she O
slipped O
out O
of O
the O
dungeon O
- O
parlour O
with O
great O
celerity O
, O
and O
reached O
the O
house O

door O
before O
the O
postboy O
had O
succeeded O
in O
his O
attempts O
to O
untie O
the O
cord O
which O
fastened O
their O
trunks O
behind O
the O
chaise O

Apparently O
hands O
were O
scarce O
at O
this O
unpromising O
hostelry O

was O
performing O
the O
business O
alone O

at O
which O
Mary S-PERSON
greatly O
rejoiced O
, O
as O
it O
enabled O
her O
to O
address O
him O
unobserved O

" O

does O
not O
seem O
a O

you O

us O

might O
do O
better O

we O
tried O
another O
? O

" O
It O
be O
the O
best O
in O
the O
town O
, O

was O
the O
reply O
. O
" O
Then O
could O
you O
not O
drive O
as O
a O
mile O
or O
two S-CARDINAL
out O
of O
it O
? O
" O
said O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
very O
coaxing O
voice O
. O
" O

should O
like O

sleep O
at O
any O
little O

my O

horses O

By O
this O
time O
Mary's S-PERSON
purse O
was O
visible O
in O
her O
hand O

The O
youth's O
countenance O
softened O
as O
he O
gazed O
upon O
it O
, O
and O
he O
presently O
gave O
an O
unequivocal O
symptom O
of O
relenting O
, O
by O
scratching O
his O
head O
. O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
held O
half O

a- O
sovereign O
between O
her O
finger O

I O
will O
give O
you O

beyond O
the O
sum O

are O
to O
receive O
for O
the O
horses O

you O
will O
drive O
us O
on O
to O
some O
clean O
country O

we O
could O

Where O
is O
the O
old O
lady O

demanded O
the O
boy O
in O
something O
like O
a O
whisper O
. O
" O
I O
will O
bring O
her O
out O
this O
moment O

said O
she O

, O
without O
waiting O
further O
parley O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
flitted O
back O
again O
through O
the O
vapour O
of O
tobacco O
and O
spirits O
to O
rescue O
her O
old O
friend O
, O
— O
a O
deed O
of O
daring O
that O
found O
its O
reward O
in O
the O
look O
of O
gentle O
satisfaction O
with O
which O
her O
signal O
to O
quit O
the O
parlour O
was O
obeyed O

for O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
was O
one O
who O
could O
not O
bandy O
words O
, O
and O
she O
had O
therefore O
endured O
, O
without O
intermission O
or O
resistance O
, O
as O
much O
insolence O
as O
could O
be O
compressed O
into O
the O
period O
of O
her O
abode O
in O
the O
apartment O

did O
you O
not O

said O
Mary S-PERSON

soon O

the O

closed O

I O
staid O
with O
her O

prevent O

How O
very O
glad O
I O
am O

got O
away O

could O
you O
have O
the O
courage O

cleverness O

you O

fair O

that O
we O
should O
divide O
the O
labours O

the O
road O

you O
who O
always O
take O
care O
that O

not O

it O
is O
not O

" O
The O
postboy O
earned O
his O
golden O
gratuity O
, O
greatly O
to O
the O
contentment O
of O
its O
donor O

by O
drawing O
up O
at O
a O
small O

where O
milk O
- O
pans O
set O
on O

mode O

the O
demand O
being O
satisfactorily O
answered O
, O
they O
were O
quickly O
installed O
in O
a O
parlour O
smelling O
of O
geraniums O
instead O
of O
gin O

giving O
orders O
for O
their O
evening O

to O
the O
bustling O
good O

the O

an O
air O

colouring O

The O
countenance O
of O
Miss O

fell O
from O

expression O
of O
great O
animation O
into O
that O
of O
deep O
despondency O

disappointment O

though O
by O

not O

nearest O

Mary S-PERSON

" O

so O

Mrs. O

again O
shook O
her O

" O
There O

upon O

" O
Mrs. O

I O
would O
give O
five B-MONEY

" O

what O

be O
the O
best O
way O

about O

makes O
with O
the O
people O
of O

mill O
in O
any O
way O

he's O
a O
good O
schollard O

a O
quick O

witted O
man O
too O

" O
This O

was O
readily O
agreed O
to O
, O
and O
the O
interval O
till O
their O
host's O

employed O
in O
a O
ramble O

a B-QUANTITY
mile E-QUANTITY

the O

a O

while O
every O

in O
the O

hardly O

the O
foreground O
, O
with O
its O
hanging O

rich O
copses O

altogether O
formed O
a O
scene O

considerable O

' O
tis O
just O

all O

plain O
enough O

himself O

" O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
, O
after O
this O
conversation O
, O
felt O
as O
fully O
convinced O
as O
the O
good O
wife O
herself O
could O
desire O
of O
the O
value O
of O
the O
landlord's O
head O
, O
and O
determined O
to O
be O
guided O
by O
his O
advice O
. O
After O
a O
little O
further O
conversation O
between O
them O
, O
it O
was O
settled O
that O
she O
should O
write O
a O
note O
to O
Mr. O
Woodcomb S-PERSON
, O
the O
manager O
, O
in O
readiness O
to O
give O

the O
hands O
of O
Mr. O

Smith E-PERSON
on O
the B-TIME
following I-TIME
morning E-TIME

if O
she O
could O
prevail O
upon O
him O
to O
deliver O
it O
. O
Mr. O
Prescot S-PERSON
performed O
his O
part O
of O
the O
business O
ably O
, O
for O
the O
portly O
miller O
was O
waiting O
for O
the O
ladies O
in O
the O
parlour O
when O
they O
returned O
from O
their O
early O
walk O
. O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
possessed O
a O
sort O
of O
instinctive O
skill O
in O
reading O
the O
human O
countenance O
, O
which O
rarely O
deceived O
her O
, O
and O
it O
took O
her O
not O
long O
to O
discover O
that O
the O
man O
she O
had O
now O
to O
deal O
with O
was O
one O
upon O
whom O
it O
would O
be O
folly O
to O
waste O
any O
arguments O
which O
did O
not O
affect O
his O
own O
interest O
. O
She O
, O
therefore O
, O
briefly O
stated O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
was O
of O
great O
importance O
to O
her O
to O
obtain O
sight O
of O
all O
the O
apprentices O
at O
Deep B-FAC
Valley I-FAC
Mill E-FAC
, O
having O
great O
reason O
to O
hope O
that O
she O
should O
find O
a O
young O
relative O
there O
, O
for O
whose O
release O
from O
all O
engagements O
she O
was O
willing O
to O
pay O
handsomely O
. O
" O
It O
is O
not O
the O
custom O
, O
ma'am O
, O
to O
admit O
visiters O
at O
that O
factory O

have O
been O
found O
to O
hinder O
the O
work O

replied O
the O
miller O
solemnly O
. O
" O
So O
I O
understand O

hardly O
enough O

good O

" O
Mr. O
Timothy B-PERSON
Smith E-PERSON
looked O
at O
Miss O
Brotherton's S-PERSON
pocket O
- O
book O
and O
he O
looked O
at O
her O
. O
His O
glance O
at O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
inspired O
a O
strong O
inclination O
to O
increase O
his O
demands O

but O
the O
miller O
had O
studied O
the O
human O
countenance O
as O
well O
as O
the O
lady O
, O
and O
when O
he O
looked O
at O
her O
he O
felt O
certain O
that O
though O
young O
, O
rich O
, O
and O
very O
eager O
in O
pursuit O
of O
her O
object O
, O
she O
was O
not O
a O
fool O
, O
and O
that O
if O
he O
pushed O
her O
to O
a O
more O
preposterous O
payment O
than O
he O
had O
already O
proposed O
, O
she O
would O
be O
likely O
enough O
to O
turn O
about O
and O
look O
for O
another O
agent O
. O
He O
therefore O
demurely O
replied O
, O
" O
It O
is O
all O
fair O

And O
without O
wasting O
any O
further O
time O
, O
the O
man O
of O
the O
mill O
received O
the O
note O

put O
on O
his O
hat O

departed O

, O
considering O
all O

had O
a O

could O
enable O
her O
to O
await O
the O
return O
of O
her O
costly O
messenger O
with O
composure O
. O
All O
that O
she O
heard O
of O
this O
mysterious O
mill O
tended O
to O
prove O
that O
it O
was O
precisely O
such O
a O
place O
as O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
would O
be O
likely O
to O
fix O
upon O

the O
abode O
of O
Michael S-PERSON

The O
more O
she O
meditated O
the O
more O
she O
became O
convinced O
that O
the O
boy O
was O
there O
, O
and O
she O
was O
hot O

cold O

pale O

red O
, O
a O
dozen S-CARDINAL
times O
in O
an B-TIME
hour E-TIME

She O
had O
kept O
a O
copy O
of O
her O
letter O
to O
the O
manager O

that O
she O
might O
show O
it O

hoped O

innocent O
fraud O

had O
practised O

To O
read O

re-read O
this O
letter O

and O
to O
speculate O
with O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
upon O
its O
probable O
and O
possible O
effects O
, O
occupied O
some O
portion O
of O
the O
tedious O
time O

slowly O
dragging O
her O
steps O
up O
and O
down O
Mrs. O
Prescot's S-PERSON
little O
garden O
, O
and O
occasionally O
sitting O
for O

fidgety O
five B-TIME

in O
a O
bower O
of O
scarlet O

runners O

employed O
the O
rest O

But O
the O
morning O
seemed O
endless O

and O
more O
than O
once O
she O
suspected O
that O
her O
watch O
stood O
still O

The O
important O
letter O
to O
Mr. O

was O
as O
follows O
: O

for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
in O
her O
life O
, O
perhaps O
, O
fully O
enjoyed O
the O
possession O

power O

at O
length O
as O
sanguine O

almost O
as O
happy O
as O
herself O

very O
freely O
confessed O

again O

again O

that O
her O

lady O
knew O
ten S-CARDINAL

lay O
the O
dismal O
spot O

the O
exceeding O
happiness O

Mr. O
Timothy B-PERSON
Smith E-PERSON

punctual O
to O
his O
appointment O

at O
a B-TIME
very I-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
past I-TIME
nine E-TIME
, O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON

Mary S-PERSON
were O
jogging O
along O
in O
the O
miller's O
jockey O
- O
cart O
, O
on O
a O
seat O
whereon O
cushions O
, O
that O
looked O
very O
like O
pillows O
, O
had O
been O
carefully O
strapped O
, O
and O
with O
a O
little O
stool O
placed O
before O
them O
, O
the O
sight O
of O
which O
conjured O
up O
so O
delightful O
a O
picture O
of O
the O
manner O
in O
which O
they O
should O
return O
, O
and O
the O
joy O
it O
would O
be O
her O
lot O
to O
confer O
, O
and O
to O
witness O
, O
that O
the O
pretty O
eyes O
of O
the O
heiress O
sparkled O
through O
tears O
of O
pleasure O
, O
and O
she O
would O
not O
have O
exchanged O
her O
present O
expedition O
for O
the O
best O
party O
of O
pleasure O
that O
ever O
was O
devised O
by O
man O
. O
A O
considerable O
part O
of O
the O
way O
was O
the O
same O
as O
that O
followed O
by O
Mr. O
Parsons S-PERSON
when O
he O
conveyed O
Michael S-PERSON
to O
the O
factory O
, O
and O
need O
not O
be O
again O
described O
. O
The O
tranquil O
loneliness O
of O
that O
portion O
of O
the O
road O
which O
ran O
along O
the O
stream O
, O
before O
it O
made O
the O
turn O
which O
brought O
the O
hideous O
prison O
- O
house O
in O
sight O
, O
lulled O
her O
spirits O
into O
a O
state O
that O
but O
ill O
prepared O
her O
for O
the O
aspect O
of O
the O
grim O
, O
desolate O
- O
looking O
dwelling O
into O
whose O
recesses O
she O
was O
about O
to O
penetrate O
| | O
and O
when O
it O
suddenly O
became O
visible O
, O
something O
like O
a O
groan O
escaped O
her O
. O
" O
I O
hope O
that O
jolt O
didn't O
hurt O
you O
, O
ma'am O

said O
the O
miller O
, O
turning O
towards O
her O
. O
" O
Here O
we O
are O

safe O

that's O
half O
my O
bargain O

at O
any O
rate O

" O
The O
vehicle O
drew O
up O
to O
a O
small O
door O
in O
the O
exterior O
wall O
of O
the O
extensive O
enclosure O
in O
which O
the O
buildings O
stood O

Mr. O
Smith S-PERSON
threw O
the O
reins O
upon O
the O
neck O
of O
his O
horse O
, O
and O
bringing O
his O
stout O
person O
cautiously O
to O
the O
ground O
, O
offered O
his O
services O
to O
assist O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
ladies O
in O
doing O
the O
same O
. O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
trembled O
as O
she O
stood O
waiting O
till O
the O
miller's O
summons O
at O
the O
door O
should O
be O
answered O
. O
Now O
that O
the O
moment O
was O
come O
which O
was O
to O
decide O
the O
question O
of O
her O
success O
or O
failure O
, O
she O
no O
longer O
felt O
the O
same O
confidence O
which O
had O
cheered O
her O
while O
the O
trial O
was O
still O
distant O
, O
and O
her O
heart O
sunk O
with O
anticipated O
disappointment O
. O
Several B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
of O
irksome O
delay O
gave O
her O
time O
to O
dwell O
on O
these O
oppressive O
forebodings O

and O
when O
the O
door O
was O
at O
length O
slowly O
and O
cautiously O
opened O
by O
Mr. O
Woodcomb S-PERSON
himself O
, O
her O
pale O
face O
spoke O
such O
painful O
anxiety O
, O
that O
the O
suspicious O
guardian O
of O
the O
unholy O
spot O
was O
comforted O
from O
the O
satisfactory O
conviction O
that O
her O
tale O
was O
true O
, O
and O
that O
she O
came O
not O
under O
any O
false O
pretences O
to O
look O
at O
that O
which O
he O
considered O
it O
to O
be O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
duty O
of O
his O
life O

conceal O

Mary S-PERSON

forward O

chair O

bent O
her O
head O

Woodcomb S-PERSON

the O

" O
A O
proposal O
which O
truly O
was O
a O
welcome O
one O
to O
all O
parties O
— O
for O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON

Mary S-PERSON
longed O
to O
be O
at O
liberty O
to O
speak O
without O
restraint O
— O
Mr. O
Smith S-PERSON
was O
thirsting O
for O
his O
accustomed O
mug O
of O
ale O
, O
and O
the O
manager O
himself O
bursting O
to O
make O
a O
few O
inquiries O
respecting O
his O
mysterious O
visiters O

" O
Have O
you O

Twenty S-CARDINAL

expressively O
patting O
the O
pocket O

the O
treasure O
lay O

out O

Mr. O

not O
of O
yours O

" O
" O
That's O
what O
I'm O
judging O
too O
, O
Mr. O
Smith S-PERSON
. O
One O
can O
see O
in O
a B-TIME
minute E-TIME

folks O

are O
roving O
here O

there O

up O

down O

take O
account O

can O

God O
grant O
that O
those O
poor O

may O
find O
what O
they O
want O

we O
shall O
both O
of O
us O
have O
made O
a O
good O
day's O
work O

it O

I O
sha'n't O
wish O
the O
thing O
talked O
of O

that's O
a O
fact O

not O

what O
I O
shall O
be O
ready O
with O
an O
answer O

if O
I'm O
troubled O
with O
questions O

People O
as O
have O
money O

throw O
about O

these O

are O
not O

off O
with O
a O
short O
word O
, O
and O
a O
lock O
turned O
in O
their O
faces O
. O
It O
mayn't O
chance O
once O
in O
a B-DATE
century E-DATE
that O
any O
such O
should O
trouble O
themselves O

off O

now O
it O
is O

must O
manage O

through O
it O
quietly O

so O
I'm O
not O
without O
my O
answer O

Mr. O
Smith S-PERSON
, O
if O
the O
squire O
should O
hear O
of O
it O

approving O

" O
Now O
then O
, O
my O
man O

said O
he O
, O
more O
gaily O
than O
he O
often O
uttered O
any O
thing O
, O
" O
sit O
you O
down O
here O

you O
shall O
presently O
have O
a O
snack O

have O
been O
thinking O
the O
matter O
over O
, O
Master B-PERSON
Miller E-PERSON
, O
and O
I O
judge O
it O
will O
make O
ten S-CARDINAL
times O
less O
talk O
and O
tumult O
that O
way O
, O
than O
if O
they O
were O
all O
turned O
out O
at O
once O

I'll O
have O
out O
a O
few O
boys O

girls O
together O
, O
chance O

like O
, O
just O
as O
they O
come O
— O
and O
ten O
to O
one O
nobody O
but O
Poulet S-PERSON
will O
find O
out O
that O
there's O
any O
thing O
more O
going O
on O
than O
some O
job O
, O
as O
I O
wants O
to O
get O
done O
. O
" O
Mr. O
Woodcomb S-PERSON
accordingly O
proceeded O
to O
the O
different O
parts O
of O
the O
large O
establishment O
, O
and O
contrived O
, O
without O
stopping O
the O
work O
any O
where O
, O
to O
perform O
the O
task O
he O
had O
undertaken O
. O
As O
the O
selected O
children O
came O
forth O
from O
the O
various O
rooms O
, O
he O
told O
them O
to O
cross O
the O
court O
to O
the O
' O
prentice O

house O

where O
they O
would O
find O
one O
as O
wanted O
to O
look O
at O
them O

adding O
an O
order O
to O
come O
back O
again O

strapped O
dead O

" O
Whenever O
such O
promises O
were O
made O
, O
Mr. O
Woodcomb S-PERSON
was O
known O
to O
be O
strictly O
a O
man O
of O
his O
word O
| | O
and O
Mary S-PERSON
and O
her O
friend O
had O
soon O
gazed O
with O
anxious O
eyes O
and O
shuddering O
hearts O
upon O
a O
greater O
number O
of O
half S-CARDINAL
- O
starved O
trembling O
little O
wretches O
, O
than O
could O
possibly O
have O
been O
made O
to O
pass O
before O
them O

an O
equally O
short O
space O
of O
time O
, O
by O
any O
other O
mode O

process O

They O
came O
so O
quickly O
in O
succession O
, O
however O
, O
that O
no O
interval O
was O
left O
in O
which O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
and O
her O
faithful O
attendant O
could O
exchange O
a O
word O
on O
the O
melancholy O
panorama O
of O
human O
misery O
that O
passed O
before O
them O
. O
Strange O
and O
unwonted O
as O
was O
the O
spectacle O
of O
" O
two S-CARDINAL
ladies O
sitting O
in O
the O
' O
prentice O
- O
house O
, O
" O
the O
cowed O
and O
frightened O
children O
, O
for O
the O
most O
part O
did O
little O
more O
than O
stand O
before O
her O
with O
eyes O
and O
mouth O
wide O
open O
for O
a B-TIME
single I-TIME
minute E-TIME
, O
and O
then O
start O
off O
again O
, O
while O
Mary S-PERSON
herself O
aided O
the O
celerity O
of O
the O
process O
by O
a O
shake O
of O
the O
head O
, O
and O
a O
wave O
of O
the O
hand O
, O
which O
indicated O
plainly O
enough O
that O
they O
were O
not O
to O
stay O
, O
but O
go O
. O
" O
What O
a O
multitude O
, O
nurse O
Tremlett S-PERSON
! O
" O
she O
exclaimed O
at O
length O
, O
her O
spirits O
worn O
with O
repeated O
disappointments O
, O
and O
the O
contemplation O
of O
the O
wretched O
creatures O
for O
whom O
she O
knew O
she O
brought O
no O
help O
. O
" O
The O
train O
seems O
endless O
! O
" O
The O
old O
woman O
returned O
her O
a O
speaking O
look O
, O
and O
whispered O
in O
her O
ear O
— O
" O
Could O
you O
not O
question O
them O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
? O
Might O
not O
this O
dismal O
work O
be O
shortened O
by O
your O
asking O
them O
if O
the O
boy O
is O
here O
? O
They O
can't O
have O
any O
reason O
to O
hide O
him O
. O
They O
can't O
be O
agents O
of O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
. O
" O
Mary S-PERSON
took O
the O
hint O
, O
and O
said O
to O
the O
next O
young O
skeleton O
that O
presented O
itself O
— O
" O
Can O
you O
tell O
me O
if O
there O
is O
a O
boy O
here O
named O
Michael B-PERSON
Armstrong E-PERSON
? O
" O
from O
working O
and O
sleeping O
in O
another O
chamber O
, O
had O
never O
heard O
poor O
Michael's S-PERSON
name O
. O
" O
No O
! O
" O
was O
pronounced O
by O
this O
one O
, O
" O
No O
, O
ma'am O
, O
" O
by O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
new O
comers O
, O
and O
Mary's S-PERSON
heart O
almost O
failing O
her O
, O
she O
resumed O
her O
silent O
examination O
. O
In O
truth O
there O
was O
in O
most O
of O
the O
unhappy O
faces O
that O
thus O
presented O
themselves O
, O
such O
a O
look O
of O
blighted O
intellect O
, O
and O
dogged O
apathy O
, O
that O
she O
clung O
to O
the O
ever O
- O
lessening O
hope O
of O
seeing O
the O
boy O
appear O
, O
in O
preference O
to O
any O
further O
questioning O
. O
And O
thus O
the O
coming O
and O
going O
lasted O
for O
another B-TIME
half I-TIME
- I-TIME
hour E-TIME
without O
a O
word O
being O
spoken O
. O
At O
length O
the O
sad O
monotony O
of O
the O
spectacle O
was O
broken O
, O
at O
least O
to O
the O
eyes O
of O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
by O
the O
appearance O
of O
a O
little O
girl O
, O
who O
though O
pale O
and O
lamentably O
thin O
, O
had O
not O
yet O
lost O
thereby O
the O
sweet O
expression O
of O
her O
delicate O
features O
, O
neither O
had O
the O
soul O
within O
yielded O
to O
the O
paralyzing O
influence O
of O
the O
hopeless O
, O
helpless O
, O
unvarying O
misery O
by O
which O
she O
was O
surrounded O
. O
Her O
soft O
gray O
eyes O
still O
retained O
their O
eloquent O
power O
of O
speaking O
, O
and O
the O
look O
of O
surprise O
, O
mixed O
with O
something O
that O
was O
almost O
approaching O
to O
pleasure O
, O
with O
which O
she O
fixed O
them O
upon O
Mary's S-PERSON
face O
caused O
her O
to O
make O
a O
sudden O
movement O
to O
detain O
her O
, O
as O
the O
child O
, O
following O
the O
example O
of O
the O
rest O
, O
was O
turning O
away O
. O
At O
first S-ORDINAL
this O
movement O
was O
caused O
entirely O
by O
the O
interest O
which O
the O
little O
creature O
herself O
inspired O
— O
but O
it O
almost O
immediately O
occurred O
to O
her O
, O
that O
here O
, O
at O
length O
, O
there O
was O
a O
chance O
of O
receiving O
a O
rational O
and O
intelligent O
answer O
to O
any O
question O
she O
might O
ask O
| | O
and O
such O
strength O
did O
this O
idea O
gain O
as O
she O
continued O
to O
look O
at O
the O
child O
, O
that O
she O
told O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
to O
stop O
the O
approach O
of O
those O
who O
were O
coming O
on O
, O
and O
by O
keeping O
them O
waiting O
in O
the O
court O
for O
a B-TIME
minute E-TIME
or O
two S-CARDINAL
, O
to O
give O
her O
time O
to O
see O
if O
she O
could O
not O
learn O
something O
from O
this O
most O
interesting O
- O
looking O
little O
creature O
. O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
showed O
that O
she O
too O
thought O
something O
might O
now O
be O
hoped O
for O
, O
and O
with O
great O
alacrity O
stepped O
out O
into O
the O
court O
to O
meet O
the O
fresh O
arrivals O
, O
shutting O
, O
to O
Mary's O
extreme O
satisfaction O
, O
the O
door O
of O
the O
room O
behind O
her O
. O
" O
My O
dear O
little O
girl O

taking O
the O
child's O
pale O

in O
hers O
, O
" O

Mary S-PERSON
almost O
gasped O
as O
she O
asked O
the O
question O

deep O
anguish O

few O
moments O

the O

close O
to O

she O
had O

entered O
in O
dismay O

exclaiming O

poor O

weeping O
from O
sorrow O

disappointment O

prostration O
of O

another O

Mrs. O

obeyed O
her O
instructions O

gently O
pushing O
back O
the O
curious O

closed O

weeping O
afresh O

, O
in O
saying O
this O

child O
ceased O
to O

, O
young O

she O
was O
, O
an O
expression O
of O
such O
hopeless O

yet O
enduring O
composure O
took O
possession O
of O
her O
beautiful O

Mary's S-PERSON
memory O
instantly O
applied O
to O
her O
Byron's S-PERSON

Fanny S-PERSON

itself O

hands O
together O

dropping O
on O

before O
Miss O

raised O
her O

eyes O
to O

at O

that O
morning O
traversed O
, O
and O
letting O
Mr. O
Smith S-PERSON
and O
his O
cart O
overtake O
them O
. O
" O
Should O
you O
dislike O
walking O
on O
, O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
? O
" O
she O
said O
. O
" O
My O
head O
aches O
, O
and O
I O
am O
sure O
nothing O
will O
relieve O
me O
but O
a O
walk O
. O
" O
" O
I O
should O
like O
it O
too O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
" O
replied O
her O
observant O
companion O
, O
looking O
anxiously O
in O
her O
face O
, O
and O
perfectly O
understanding O
her O
feelings O
. O
" O
Walk O
, O
ladies O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
Mr. O
Woodcomb S-PERSON
, O
looking O
exceedingly O
shocked O
, O
" O
ladies O
such O
as O
you O
to O
walk O
out O
upon O
our O
wild O
moors O
? O
Oh O
dear O
no O
! O
That O
is O
quite O
impossible O
! O
" O
This O
was O
said O
to O
prove O
at O
once O
his O
tender O
care O
of O
personages O
possessing O
the O
power O
of O
dispensing O
hundreds S-CARDINAL
, O
and O
to O
show O
that O
he O
was O
not O
unacquainted O
with O
the O
refinements O
of O
polite O
society O
| | O
but O
this O
civilly O
- O
intended O
opposition O
to O
their O
exit O
produced O
on O
his O
hearers O
an O
effect O
very O
different O
from O
what O
he O
intended O
. O
That O
Fanny B-PERSON
Fletcher E-PERSON
should O
tremble O
at O
the O
mention O
of O
delay O
was O
not O
extraordinary O
, O
but O
that O
Mary S-PERSON
should O
hear O
again O
, O
in O
fancy O
, O
the O
grating O
sound O
of O
the O
locks O
and O
bars O
, O
which O
had O
closed O
behind O
her O
as O
she O
entered O
, O
and O
feel O
a O
sick O
qualm O
at O
her O
heart O
, O
as O
if O
she O
were O
betrayed O
, O
and O
doomed O
to O
remain O
in O
that O
hateful O
spot O
against O
her O
will O
, O
showed O
that O
her O
nerves O
had O
indeed O
been O
severely O
shaken O
, O
and O
that O
her O
heroism O
had O
more O
of O
zeal O
than O
strength O
in O
it O
. O
at O
present O
. O
She O
is O
a O
great O
walker O
, O
and O
a O
mile O
or O
so O
, O
creeping O
along O
in O
the O
fresh O
air O
, O
will O
do O
her O
a O
deal O
of O
good O
. O
" O
" O
In O
course O
you O
know O
best O
, O
ladies O
, O
and O
I O
can't O
, O
for O
certain O
, O
take O
the O
liberty O
to O
oppose O
. O
But O
, O
by O
your O
leave O
, O
I'll S-PERSON
just O
mention O
your O
plan O
to O
Mr. O
Smith S-PERSON
before O
you O
start O
, O
and O
then O
, O
maybe O
he'll O
be O
for O
pushing O
on O
his O
horse O
a O
little O
. O
" O
So O
saying O
, O
Mr. O
Woodcomb S-PERSON
left O
them O
| | O
when O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
turning O
to O
the O
little O
girl O
, O
said O
, O
" O
Have O
you O
any O
bonnet O
and O
shawl O
to O
put O
on O
, O
Fanny S-PERSON
? O
" O
" O
I O
don't O
know O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
child O
. O
" O
Not O
know O
? O
How O
can O
that O
be O
, O
Fanny S-PERSON
? O
" O
" O
Because O
I O
have O
never O
been O
out O
of O
the O
doors O
since O
I O
first S-ORDINAL
came O
into O
them O
, O
" O
said O
Fanny S-PERSON
. O
" O
Poor O
dear O
! O
I O
wish O
they O
would O
not O
keep O
you O
here O
any O
longer O
— O
this O
is O
quite O
intolerable O
! O
" O
said O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
again O
opening O
the O
door O
, O
and O
looking O
impatiently O
across O
the O
dismal O
court O
. O
" O
Keep O
me O
here O
? O
" O
murmured O
the O
little O
girl O
, O
in O
a O
voice O
of O
the O
most O
evident O
terror O
. O
" O
Do O
you O
think O
they O
will O
keep O
me O
here O
? O
" O
" O
No O
, O
no O
, O
my O
poor O
child O
, O
they O
shall O
not O
keep O
you O
here O
, O
" O
said O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
, O
kindly O
. O
" O
Here O
come O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
men O
together O
. O
" O
Fanny S-PERSON
did O
not O
venture O
to O
look O
at O
them O
, O
but O
Mary S-PERSON
did O
| | O
and O
again O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
her O
reason O
, O
she O
felt O
terrified O
at O
the O
idea O
that O
she O
was O
in O
their O
power O
. O
Mr. O
Woodcomb S-PERSON
, O
indeed O
, O
looked O
smiling O
and O
obsequious O
as O
before O
, O
but O
in O
the O
countenance O
of O
the O
burly O
miller O
there O
was O
something O
of O
opposition O
and O
displeasure O
that O
she O
could O
not O
understand O
. O
" O
Setting O
off O
walking O
, O
miss O
, O
is O
very O
like O
bilking O
your O
driver O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
with O
considerably O
more O
bluntness O
than O
civility O
. O
" O
What O
does O
he O
mean O
, O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
? O
" O
said O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
turning O
pale O
. O
" O
You O
had O
better O
pay O
the O
gentleman O
before O
you O
set O
out O
, O
my O
dear O
. O
That's O
what O
you O
mean O
to O
say O
, O
isn't O
it O
, O
sir O
? O
" O
" O
Why O
surely O
, O
ma'am O
, O
it O
would O
be O
more O
like O
doing O
business O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
man O
, O
looking O
a O
little O
ashamed O
of O
himself O
. O
" O
Is O
that O
all O
? O
" O
said O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
inexpressibly O
relieved O
, O
and O
drawing O
out O
her O
ready O
purse O
with O
such O
cheerful O
alacrity O
, O
that O
could O
the O
hearts O
of O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
men O
before O
whom O
she O
stood O
have O
been O
read O
, O
there O
might O
have O
been O
found O
in O
both O
a O
strong O
inclination O
to O
profit O
by O
it O
a O
little O
further O
. O
" O
That O
, O
I O
think O
, O
sir O
, O
is O
the O
sum O
you O
named O
for O
the O
hire O
of O
your O
vehicle O
? O
" O
said O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
extending O
her O
hand O
with O
two S-CARDINAL
sovereigns O
towards O
him O
. O
Mr. O
Timothy B-PERSON
Smith E-PERSON
took O
the O
money O
, O
but O
certainly O
thought O
that O
if O
that O
sharp O
- O
eyed O
rogue O
Woodcomb S-ORG
had O
been O
further O
he O
might O
have O
hit O
upon O
some O
excuse O
for O
demanding O
more O
. O
As O
it O
was O
, O
however O
, O
he O
could O
not O
venture O
it O
, O
and O
with O
a O
rather O
surly O
inclination O
of O
the O
head O
, O
pocketed O
the O
gold O
, O
and O
left O
the O
room O
. O
" O
Now O
then O
, O
sir O
, O
if O
you O
please O
, O
" O
said O
the O
still O
frightened O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
" O
we O
will O
wish O
you O
good O
morning O
. O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
ma'am O
, O
surely O
, O
you O
can O
go O
if O
you O
please O
. O
Only O
perhaps O
you O
might O
like O
, O
for O
the O
honour O
of O
your O
young O
relation O
here O
, O
to O
leave O
some O
little O
gratuity O
to O
be O
divided O
as O
a O
little O
treat O
among O
her O
late O
companions O
? O
" O
Mary S-PERSON
looked O
in O
his O
face O
, O
and O
the O
sort O
of O
half S-CARDINAL
- O
ashamed O
glance O
with O
which O
the O
extortioner O
watched O
the O
effect O
of O
his O
words O
, O
appeared O
to O
her O
so O
sinister O
, O
that O
with O
a O
sudden O
feeling O
of O
something O
like O
rational O
alarm O
, O
she O
remembered O
that O
she O
had O
only O
a B-MONEY
few I-MONEY
shillings E-MONEY
left O
in O
her O
purse O
, O
and O
that O
again O
to O
open O
in O
his O
presence O
her O
still O
well O
- O
filled O
pocket O
- O
book O
, O
might O
be O
dangerous O
. O
" O
Aunt O
Tremlett S-PERSON
, O
have O
you O
any O
money O
to O
lend O
me O
? O
" O
she O
said O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
drawing O
out O
again O
her O
almost O
empty O
purse O
. O
" O
I O
am O
very O
sorry O
I O
have O
only O
these O
few O
shillings O
left O

but O
I O
will O
willingly O
send O
you O
five B-QUANTITY
pounds E-QUANTITY
, O
sir O
, O
for O
the O
purpose O

mention O
, O
if O
the O
miller O
will O
take O
the O
trouble O
of O
bringing O
it O
to O
you O
. O
" O
" O
Oh O
! O
It's O
no O
matter O
, O
ladies O
. O
Pray O
do O
not O
trouble O
yourselves O
any O
more O
about O
it O
, O
" O
replied O
Woodcomb S-PERSON
, O
keeping O
his O
eyes O
, O
however O
, O
furtively O
directed O
towards O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
still O
engaged O
in O
seeking O
for O
money O
in O
the O
recesses O
of O
a O
very O
large O
pocket O
. O
" O
I O
have O
two B-QUANTITY
pounds E-QUANTITY
and O
a O
few O
shillings O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
" O
said O
the O
old O
lady O
, O
at O
length O
placing O
her O
little O
leathern O
purse O
in O
Mary's O
hand O
. O
" O
That O
will O
do O
, O
that O
will O
do O
perfectly O
, O
" O
said O
the O
worshipper O
of O
Mammon S-PERSON
, O
with O
an O
air O
and O
tone O
of O
the O
most O
amiable O
liberality O
, O
but O
at O
the O
same O
time O
stretching O
out O
his O
hand O
, O
in O
which O
he O
received O
the O
entire O
contents O
, O
uncounted O
, O
of O
Mrs. O
Tremlett's S-PERSON
purse O
, O
which O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
unclasped O
, O
and O
emptied O
into O
it O
. O
Had O
she O
studied O
the O
man's O
character O
for O
years S-DATE
, O
she O
could O
not O
have O
devised O
any O
manoeuvre O
so O
likely O
to O
hasten O
the O
unlocking O
the O
door O
which O
enclosed O
them O
as O
thus O
emptying O
their O
two S-CARDINAL
purses O
before O
his O
eyes O
. O
He O
now O
moved O
forward O
of O
his O
own O
accord O
, O
drew O
forth O
from O
the O
pocket O
of O
his O
coat O
the O
massive O
key O
, O
applied O
it O
with O
a O
large O
, O
strong O
, O
and O
effective O
hand O
, O
to O
the O
enormous O
lock O
, O
drew O
back O
the O
heavy O
bolts O
, O
and O
finally O
threw O
wide O
the O
hateful O
door O
. O
The O
three S-CARDINAL
females O
passed O
through O
it O
with O
no O
lingering O
steps O
, O
and O
heard O
it O
close O
heavily O
behind O
them O
, O
with O
feelings O
assuredly O
very O
different O
in O
degree O
, O
but O
in O
so O
far O
the O
same O
, O
that O
each O
one O
as O
she O
stepped O
over O
the O
threshold O
, O
breathed O
a O
prayer O
that O
she O
might O
never O
repass O
it O
again O

that O

quitting O
those O
hideous O
walls O

it O
can O
hardly O
fail O
to O
convey O
a O
sense O
of O
beauty O

freshness O

and O
freedom O
, O
sufficient O
to O
expand O
the O
heart O
with O
admiration O
and O
delight O
. O
Mary S-PERSON
felt O
disposed O
to O
bound O
along O
the O
grassy O
path O
beside O
the O
stream O
with O
the O
joyous O
playfulness O
of O
a O
child O
, O
and O
rather O
than O
have O
re-entered O
that O
creaking O
door O
again O
, O
would O
have O
been O
tempted O
, O
like O
another O
Undine S-PRODUCT
, O
to O
plunge O
into O
the O
water O
, O
and O
take O
her O
chance O
of O
finding O
quarters O
less O
hateful O
beneath O
its O
rippling O
wave O
. O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
breathed O
more O
freely O
, O
and O
seemed O
to O
have O
recovered O
the O
elastic O
step O
of O
youth O
, O
as O
she O
moved O
briskly O
on O
. O
But O
compared O
with O
what O
was O
passing O
in O
the O
breast O
of O
the O
ragged O
, O
dirty O
little O
creature O
that O
walked O
beside O
them O
, O
their O
feelings O
were O
most O
earthly O
cold O
and O
dull O
. O
Her O
small O
hand O
was O
still O
clasped O
in O
that O
of O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
, O
who O
felt O
that O
the O
child O
was O
urging O
her O
onward O
, O
even O
faster O
than O
she O
was O
inclined O
to O
go O
, O
while O
her O
head O
upturned O
towards O
the O
towering O
heights O
which O
hemmed O
them O
in O
, O
seemed O
eagerly O
seeking O
an O
outlet O
from O
the O
region O
that O
her O
soul O
abhorred O
. O
" O
You O
are O
glad O
, O
dear O
Fanny S-PERSON
, O
are O
you O
not O
, O
to O
know O
that O
you O
have O
left O
that O
frightful O
place O
? O
" O
said O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
kindly O
pressing O
the O
little O
emaciated O
hand O
she O
held O
in O
hers O
. O
The O
child O
stopped O
short O
in O
her O
hurried O
walk O
, O
and O
looking O
up O
in O
her O
deliverer's O
face O
, O
with O
a O
doubting O
anxious O
look O
that O
it O
was O
painful O
to O
see O
, O
murmured O
very O
softly O
, O
and O
as O
if O
fearing O
to O
be O
overheard O
from O
within O
the O
walls O
, O
" O
Shall O
I O
never O
, O
never O
go O
back O
again O
? O
" O
" O
No O
, O
never O
Fanny S-PERSON
! O
Do O
you O
think O
I O
would O
be O
so O
cruel O
as O
to O
take O
you O
back O
? O
" O
said O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
" O
I O
do O
not O
know O
if O
it O
is O
not O
all O
a O
dream O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
child O
. O
" O
I O
have O
dreamed O
that O
I O
saw O
green O
grass O
, O
and O
felt O
the O
air O
upon O
my O
face O
, O
before O
. O
" O
" O
Do O
not O
be O
afraid O
, O
Fanny S-PERSON
! O
You O
are O
not O
dreaming O
now O
, O
" O
returned O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
" O
Run O
on O
, O
and O
gather O
that O
fine O
large O
stalk O
of O
foxglove O
. O
You O
never O
saw O
such O
a O
gay O
flower O
as O
that O
in O
your O
dreams O
, O
did O
you O
? O
" O
The O
little O
girl O
sprang O
forward O
, O
and O
falling O
upon O
her O
knees O
on O
the O
grass O
, O
plucked O
the O
tall O
flower O
, O
and O
pressed O
it O
to O
her O
lips O
, O
and O
to O
her O
heart O
. O
But O
though O
this O
was O
a O
childish O
action O
, O
it O
was O
not O
done O
childishly O
: O
there O
was O
an O
appearance O
of O
deep O
feeling O
, O
and O
even O
of O
devotion O
in O
her O
look O
and O
attitude O
which O
strongly O
awakened O
Mary's S-PERSON
interest O
, O
and O
when O
the O
little O
creature O
rose O
again O
, O
and O
holding O
the O
flower O
in O
one S-CARDINAL
hand O
, O
slid O
the O
other O
once O
more O
into O
that O
of O
her O
new O
friend O
, O
the O
heart O
of O
that O
friend O
yearned O
towards O
her O
with O
newly O
- O
awakened O
tenderness O
. O
But O
when O
she O
spoke O
to O
her O
, O
and O
endeavoured O
to O
lead O
her O
into O
conversation O
, O
the O
attempt O
entirely O
failed O
. O
There O
are O
many O
who O
might O
have O
felt O
disappointed O
and O
chilled O
by O
this O
| | O
but O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton E-PERSON
had O
truer O
sympathy O
, O
and O
as O
, O
from O
time O
to O
time O
, O
she O
felt O
a O
loving O
contraction O
of O
Fanny's O
little O
fingers O
upon O
her O
own O
, O
and O
sometimes O
caught O
her O
looking O
up O
, O
as O
if O
by O
stealth O
into O
her O
face O
, O
she O
felt O
no O
misgivings O
as O
to O
the O
cause O
of O
her O
silence O
, O
but O
loved O
her O
the O
better O
from O
knowing O
that O
her O
heart O
was O
too O
full O
to O
speak O
. O
forward O
as O
long O
as O
their O
road O
continued O
along O
the O
margin O
of O
the O
stream O
| | O
but O
when O
it O
turned O
round O
the O
steep O
hill's O
base O
, O
and O
began O
to O
mount O
, O
their O
pace O
relaxed O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
felt O
that O
her O
little O
companion O
dragged O
on O
her O
steps O
with O
labour O
, O
and O
perceived O
that O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
was O
out O
of O
breath O
. O
" O
Let O
us O
sit O
down O
under O
this O
ash O
- O
tree O
, O
and O
wait O
for O
the O
jolly O
miller O
, O
" O
said O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
, O
" O
it O
cannot O
be O
very O
long O
, O
I O
think O
, O
before O
he O
overtakes O
us O
. O
" O
This O
proposal O
was O
the O
more O
amiable O
, O
because O
, O
in O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
place O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
could O
herself O
have O
run O
from O
the O
bottom O
of O
that O
steep O
hill O
to O
the O
top O
, O
almost O
without O
perceiving O
that O
it O
was O
any O
hill O
at O
all O
| | O
and O
in O
the O
next O
, O
she O
so O
exceedingly O
disliked O
both O
the O
miller O
and O
his O
cart O
, O
that O
had O
she O
consulted O
her O
own O
inclinations O
alone O
, O
she O
would O
probably O
have O
preferred O
retracing O
the O
whole O
way O
on O
foot O
. O
But O
very O
gladly O
was O
her O
proposal O
for O
rest O
accepted O
, O
by O
both O
her O
old O
and O
young O
companion O
, O
and O
long O
did O
they O
remain O
seated O
under O
their O
pleasant O
canopy O
before O
they O
any O
of O
them O
grew O
weary O
of O
it O
| | O
till O
at O
length O
, O
after O
consulting O
her O
watch O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
expressed O
a O
doubt O
whether O
the O
fat O
miller O
and O
his O
lazy O
steed O
intended O
to O
overtake O
them O
at O
all O
. O
" O
Good O
gracious O
, O
my O
dear O
! O
do O
you O
really O
think O
so O
? O
" O
said O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
, O
considerably O
alarmed O
. O
" O
Why O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
we O
shall O
never O
get O
back O
to O
Mrs. O
Prescot's S-PERSON
without O
him O
! O
" O
" O
I O
hope O
I O
may O
be O
mistaken O
, O
my O
dear O
old O
woman O
, O
" O
said O
her O
kind O
mistress O
, O
affectionately O
| | O
" O
for O
I O
fear O
such O
a O
walk O
would O
be O
too O
much O
for O
you O
. O
But O
when O
I O
remember O
that O
he O
is O
paid O
, O
and O
remember O
, O
likewise O
, O
how O
very O
little O
he O
seemed O
actuated O
by O
any O
motive O
, O
save O
that O
of O
sordid O
interest O
, O
I O
confess O
that O
I O
do O
think O
it O
very O
probable O
he O
means O
to O
leave O
us O
in O
the O
lurch O
. O
" O
" O
Then O
let O
us O
walk O
on O
, O
Miss O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
without O
saying O
a O
word O
more O
about O
it O
. O
The O
shadows O
are O
beginning O
to O
grow O
long O
already O
, O
and O
you O
shan't O
be O
kept O
out O
half O
the O
night O
by O
my O
laziness O
. O
Come O
along O
, O
little O
girl O
. O
" O
With O
these O
words O
, O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
raised O
herself O
from O
between O
two S-CARDINAL
comfortable O
roots O
, O
which O
had O
made O
her O
an O
excellent O
arm O
- O
chair O
| | O
but O
the O
little O
girl O
whom O
she O
summoned O
to O
do O
likewise O
, O
though O
she O
exerted O
herself O
to O
get O
on O
her O
feet O
, O
seemed O
hardly O
able O
to O
stand O
. O
" O
My O
poor O
Fanny S-PERSON
, O
you O
are O
quite O
knocked O
up O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
, O
looking O
at O
her O
with O
great O
anxiety O
. O
" O
How O
in O
the O
world O
shall O
we O
ever O
be O
able O
to O
get O
her O
on O
? O
" O
" O
It O
is O
only O
because O
I O
have O
not O
been O
used O
to O
walk O
lately O
, O
" O
said O
Fanny S-PERSON
| | O
" O
that O
is O
, O
not O
as O
we O
have O
been O
walking O
now O
. O
Our O
work O
keeps O
us O
always O
on O
our O
legs O
, O
and O
that O
makes O
them O
bend O
about O
so O
, O
when O
I O
try O
to O
walk O
| | O
but O
I O
can O
walk O
though O
it O
hurts O
me O
, O
and O
I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
better O
to O
die O
outright O
in O
getting O
on O
, O
rather O
than O
rest O
so O
near O
the O
factory O
— O
so O
, O
please O
ma'am O
, O
I'm O
quite O
ready O
to O
go O
on O
. O
" O
The O
dilemma O
was O
not O
a O
pleasant O
one O
. O
They O
were O
still O
in O
a O
part O
of O
the O
road O
so O
little O
frequented O
, O
that O
it O
was O
probable O
they O
might O
wait O
for O
hours O
without O
obtaining O
assistance O
from O
any O
passer O
by O
, O
nor O
did O
either O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
or O
Mary S-PERSON
recollect O
to O
have O
seen O
any O
dwelling O
nearer O
than O
the O
high O
- O
road O
, O
from O
which O
they O
were O
still O
at O
a O
considerable O
distance O
. O
The O
distress O
of O
the O
little O
girl O
was O
painful O
to O
witness O
. O
At O
the O
very O
moment O
when O
the O
dark O
cloud O
which O
had O
seemed O
to O
settle O
upon O
her O
was O
withdrawn O
, O
and O
hope O
gradually O
and O
with O
difficulty O
, O
as O
to O
eyes O
long O
unaccustomed O
to O
its O
light O
, O
began O
to O
reach O
her O
| | O
at O
that O
very O
moment O
her O
strength O
failed O
, O
and O
a O
sensation O
, O
like O
the O
sickness O
of O
death O
, O
rendered O
every O
attempt O
at O
further O
exertion O
impossible O
. O
" O
I O
must O
stay O
here O
, O
" O
she O
said O

" O
it O
is O
the O
will O
of O
God O

" O
" O
No O
, O
no O

Fanny S-PERSON

" O
said O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
, O
seating O
herself O
beside O
her O
, O
and O
letting O
the O
languid O
little O
head O
drop O
upon O
her O
bosom O

" O
you O

thousand E-CARDINAL

Mary S-PERSON

eagerly O

suddenly O
stopping O
herself O

added O

heart O

if O
I O
took O
you O
for O
company O
, O
while O
this O
little O
creature O
was O
left O
with O
nothing O
but O
her O
own O
melancholy O
thoughts O
and O
childish O
terrors O
to O
comfort O
her O
. O
" O
" O
Then O
I O
will O
stay O
, O
" O
said O
the O
poor O
woman O
, O
sighing O
heavily O
: O
" O
but O
just O
think O
, O
Miss O
Mary S-PERSON

how O
I O
shall O
feel O
till O
you O
come O
back O
again O

" O
" O
I O
will O
not O
loiter O
to O
amuse O
myself O

replied O
her O
young O
mistress O
with O
a O
cheering O
smile O

" O
and O
now O
take O
my O
place O
, O
and O
let O
this O
poor O
little O
head O
rest O
on O
your O
shoulder O
. O
" O
upon O
my O
lap O
, O
" O
said O
the O
old O
nurse O
, O
tenderly O
assisting O
Mary S-PERSON
to O
lift O
her O
up O
. O
" O
God O
bless O
you O

my O
dear O
good O
soul O

I O
will O
be O
quickly O
back O
again O

replied O
her O
grateful O
mistress O
. O
" O
How O
much O
more O
you O
show O
you O
love O
me O
now O
, O
than O
if O
you O
insisted O
upon O
walking O
after O
me O
. O
There O
! O
she O
lies O
as O
nicely O
as O
if O
she O
were O
in O
bed O
. O
If O
our O
faithless O
miller O
makes O
his O
appearance O
, O
keep O
him O
and O
his O
cart O
till O
I O
come O
back O

tell O
him O
he O
shall O
have O
more O
gold O
, O
and O
he O
will O
stand O
waiting O
beside O
you O
, O
as O
gentle O
as O
a O
lamb O
. O
" O
Having O
said O
these O
comforting O
words O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
instened O
onward O
and O
was O
speedily O
out O
of O
sight O
. O
Having O
reached O
the O
top O
of O
the O
hill O
, O
she O
looked O
anxiously O
round O
in O
search O
of O
a O
human O
dwelling O
, O
but O
nothing O
met O
her O
eye O
, O
but O
barren O
moor O
- O
land O
, O
which O
at O
some O
distance O
showed O
symptoms O
of O
cultivation O
, O
being O
enclosed O
in O
patches O
by O
low O
stone O
walls O
, O
and O
here O
and O
there O
the O
fragment O
of O
a O
stunted O
hawthorn O
fence O
, O
which O
seemed O
to O
sustain O
a O
hungry O
life O
with O
difficulty O
. O
Making O
her O
way O
across O
the O
rude O
and O
imperfectly O
- O
formed O
sunk O
fence O
, O
which O
marked O
the O
boundary O
of O
the O
cart O
- O
road O
, O
along O
which O
they O
had O
travelled O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
found O
herself O
on O
a O
level O
of O
some O
extent O
, O
but O
without O
the O
slightest O
track O
to O
direct O
her O
steps O
amidst O
the O
long O
parched O
grass O
, O
and O
frequent O
stones O
with O
which O
it O
was O
covered O
. O
" O
This O
will O
never O
do O
! O
I O
may O
walk O
here O
till O
I O
have O
completely O
lamed O
myself O
, O
without O
a O
chance O
of O
meeting O
any O
living O
soul O
, O
" O
thought O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
stopping O
short O
| | O
" O
I O
shall O
do O
better O
by O
making O
for O
the O
high O
- O
road O
at O
once O
. O
" O
And O
having O
so O
decided O
, O
she O
turned O
about O
to O
retrace O
her O
steps O
, O
and O
regain O
the O
road O

but O
ere O
she O
reched O
it O
, O
a O
sort O
of O
hillock O
at O
a O
little O
distance O
caught O
her O
eye O
, O
and O
wishing O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O
its O
elevation O
, O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
reconnoitring O
, O
she O
turned O
aside O
to O
reach O
it O
. O
Her O
approach O
to O
it O
was O
from O
the O
east O
, O
and O
a O
dazzling O
sunset O
was O
in O
her O
eyes O
, O
as O
she O
made O
her O
way O
up O
the O
rugged O
side O
of O
what O
looked O
like O
one O
of O
the O
tumuli O
which O
served O
as O
resting O
- O
places O
for O
human O
bones O
, O
ere O
churchyards O
yawned O
for O
them O
. O
Greatly O
was O
she O
startled O
on O
reaching O
the O
top O
of O
it O
, O
to O
perceive O
on O
the O
western O
side O
, O
crouching O
in O
a O
hollow O
that O
looked O
as O
if O
it O
had O
been O
excavated O
by O
the O
shelter O
- O
seeking O
sheep O
, O
a O
strange O
wild O
figure O
, O
whose O
dress O
, O
as O
she O
looked O
down O
upon O
it O
, O
left O
its O
sex O
doubtful O
. O
The O
fragment O
of O
a O
hat O
, O
and O
the O
remnant O
of O
a O
jacket O
were O
evidently O
intended O
, O
by O
their O
original O
construction O
, O
for O
the O
use O
of O
the O
nobler O
sex O
, O
while O
something O
resembling O
a O
petticoat O
enveloping O
the O
lower O
half O
of O
the O
figure O
, O
suggested O
the O
probability O
that O
the O
masculine O
portion O
of O
the O
attire O
was O
worn O
by O
sufferance O
, O
and O
not O
by O
right O
. O
Mary's S-PERSON
light O
step O
among O
the O
matted O
tufts O
of O
coarse O
vegetation O
which O
covered O
the O
thin O
soil O
, O
had O
not O
been O
heard O
, O
and O
she O
stood O
looking O
down O
upon O
her O
doubtful O
neighbour O
with O
the O
advantage O
of O
being O
herself O
unseen O
. O
" O
There O
goes O
another O
day O
! O
" O
said O
a O
voice O
, O
which O
though O
harsh O
and O
aged O
, O
was O
unmistakably O
female O
| | O
" O
and O
the O
silly O
soul O
has O
got O
to O
wait O
for O
another O

" O
Glad O
to O
find O
that O
her O
unexpected O
companion O
in O
this O
most O
desolate O
spot O
, O
was O
of O
the O
safer O
, O
because O
the O
weaker O
portion O
of O
the O
human O
race O
, O
the O
wandering O
heiress O
determined O
to O
address O
her O

but O
deemed O
it O
wisest O
to O
approach O
her O
visibly O
, O
instead O
of O
startling O
the O
poor O
soul O
by O
speaking O
to O
her O
unexpectedly O
from O
the O
spot O
where O
she O
stood O
. O
For O
this O
purpose O
, O
she O
gently O
descended O
from O
her O
elevation O
, O
and O
making O
a O
little O
circuit O
, O
presented O
herself O
before O
the O
eyes O
of O
the O
sun-gazer O
. O
The O
old O
woman O
, O
for O
such O
she O
was O
, O
sat O
nose O
and O
knees O
together O
, O
in O
a O
sort O
of O
hole O
which O
completely O
sheltered O
her O
in O
every O
direction O
but O
the O
west O
| | O
and O
from O
the O
earnest O
manner O
in O
which O
her O
dim O
eyes O
were O
fixed O
upon O
the O
last O
bright O
rays O
of O
the O
setting O
sun O
, O
it O
seemed O
as O
if O
her O
lair O
was O
chosen O
on O
purpose O
to O
look O
upon O
it O

The O
appearance O
of O
Mary S-PERSON
seemed O
to O
startle O
her O
, O

not O
much O

for O

looking O
at O
her O
for O
a B-TIME
minute E-TIME

if O
she O
examined O
her O
person O
with O
difficulty O

dazzled O
by O
the O
object O

the O

disappeared O

Mary S-PERSON
shuddered O
as O
the O
wild O
speech O

creature O
confirmed O
the O
idea O

insanity O

steps O

shrill O

trembling O
voice O

accent O

herself O
at O
every O
step O
round O
the O
stick O

close O

up O

her O
face O

a O
soft O
, O
silly O
smile O

that O
had O
all O
the O
woful O
innocence O

imbecility O

a O
small O
, O
skinny O
hand O
that O
was O
delicatelypale O

perfectly O
clean O

she O
took O
the O
end O
of O
Mary's O
silk O

gazed O

sort O

ecstasy O

fine O

oh O

patting O
it O
with O
her O

breaking O

" O

replied O
the O
poor O
creature O
, O
in O
a O
tone O
which O
convinced O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
that O
she O
understood O
her O
, O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
beginning O
to O
hobble O
on O
before O
her O
towards O
the O
road O
. O
desperate O
one O
, O
determined O
to O
follow O
wherever O
her O
feeble O
guide O
should O
lead O
, O
certain O
, O
at O
least O
, O
that O
the O
distance O
could O
not O
be O
very O
great O
. O
There O
was O
, O
however O
, O
much O
more O
strength O
and O
power O
of O
locomotion O
in O
the O
little O
cripple O
than O
she O
gave O
her O
credit O
for O
. O
Having O
contrived O
to O
crawl O
through O
the O
grassy O
dyke O
that O
fenced O
the O
moor O
, O
she O
crossed O
the O
road O
obliquely O
, O
and O
making O
her O
way O
through O
a O
very O
imperfect O
hedge O
of O
furze O
and O
quickset O
, O
hobbled O
on O
across O
a O
bit O
of O
miserably O
arid O
stubble O
, O
which O
presently O
descended O
abruptly O
, O
and O
led O
to O
a O
tuft O
of O
stunted O
elder O
- O
bushes O
, O
besides O
which O
stood O
a O
small O
farm O
- O
house O
, O
with O
its O
cow O
- O
yard O
, O
barns O
, O
and O
ricks O
. O
Surprised O
and O
delighted O
to O
find O
herself O
so O
near O
a O
human O
dwelling O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
had O
hardly O
patience O
to O
restrain O
her O
steps O
to O
the O
pace O
of O
her O
poor O
guide O
, O
nevertheless O
she O
had O
not O
the O
heart O
to O
leave O
her O
, O
for O
there O
was O
an O
expression O
of O
pride O
and O
pleasure O
in O
the O
woman's O
eye O
as O
she O
turned O
round O
from O
time O
to O
time O
as O
they O
advanced O
, O
which O
she O
felt O
it O
would O
be O
most O
cruel O
to O
check O
by O
showing O
that O
she O
could O
do O
without O
her O
. O
So O
it O
was O
together O
that O
they O
reached O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
steep O
descent O
, O
and O
together O
that O
they O
entered O
the O
kitchen O
of O
the O
farm O
- O
house O
, O
where O
a O
very O
decent O
- O
looking O
, O
middle O
- O
aged O
woman O
was O
engaged O
in O
preparing O
supper O
. O
She O
looked O
exceedingly O
surprised O
at O
the O
appearance O
of O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
, O
and O
for O
a O
moment O
turned O
her O
eyes O
from O
her O
to O
her O
companion O
, O
and O
back O
again O
, O
with O
an O
air O
that O
was O
almost O
bewildered O
| | O
but O
soon O
recovering O
herself O
she O
courtesied O
with O
much O
respect O
, O
and O
said O
, O
" O
I O
hope O
you O
haven't O
been O
scared O

ma'am O

by O
falling O
in O
with O
this O
poor O
cretur O

is O
as O
harmless O
as O
a O
baby O
. O
" O
" O
Oh O
, O
no O
! O
" O
replied O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
" O
she O
has O
been O
very O
kind O
to O
me O
, O
for O
she O
has O
brought O
me O
here O
, O
where O
I O
should O
never O
have O
been O
able O
to O
get O
without O
her O
, O
the O
house O
is O
so O
completely O
concealed O

I O
want O

very O
much O
indeed O

" O
" O
You O
haven't O
met O
no O
accident O

I O
hope O
? O
" O
said O
the O
good O
woman O
, O
kindly O
, O
and O
ceasing O
her O
notable O
operations O
, O
she O
drew O
forward O
a O
wooden O
chair O
for O
her O
guest O
to O
sit O
upon O
. O
" O
Thank O
you O
very O
much O
, O
" O
said O
the O
young O
lady O
, O
seating O
herself O
. O
" O
Yet O
it O
is O
not O
rest O
I O
most O
want O

I O
have O
a O
little O
girl O
with O
me O

I O
have O
left O
by O
the O
side O
of O
the O
road O
that O
leads O
from O
the O
mills O

she O
is O
too O
weak O
and O
ill O
to O
get O
on O
, O
and O
I O
hope O
you O
will O
be O
able O
to O
lend O
me O
some O
conveyance O
— O
a O
cart O
, O
a O
waggon O
, O
any O
thing O

far O

four B-QUANTITY

suppose O
from O

would O
pay O
well O

it O

the O
mills O

" O
repeated O
the O
woman O
staring O
" O
Yes O

from O
the O
place O
called O
Deep B-LOC
Valley I-LOC

" O
replied O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
" O
perhaps O
rather O
more O
than O
a O
mile O
from O
here O

" O
" O
Oh O
! O
ma'am O
, O
I O
know O
the B-FAC
Deep I-FAC

well O
enough O

" O
was O
the O
answer O
. O
" O
All O
Mr. O
Woodcomb's S-PERSON
own O
butter O
and O
milk O
comes O
from O
here O
. O
That O
is O
not O
the O
difficulty O
. O
But O
we O
shan't O
like O
to O
have O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
carrying O
away O
any O
child O
from O
there O
. O
" O
" O
You O
need O
fear O
nothing O
on O
that O
point O
, O
" O
replied O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
, O
eagerly O
, O
" O
I O
have O
paid O
for O
permission O
to O
bring O
this O
child O
away O
. O
" O
— O
there O
is O
something O
very O
odd O
too O
, O
in O
such O
a O
lady O
as O
you O
walking O
away O
from O
the O
factory O
with O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
children O
. O
" O
" O
Indeed O
I O
do O
not O
wonder O
at O
your O
saying O
so O
. O
But O
believe O
me O
, O
I O
tell O
you O
nothing O
but O
the O
truth O
when O
I O
assure O
you O
that O
I O
have O
permission O
, O
and O
have O
paid O
largely O
for O
it O
, O
to O
bring O
this O
child O
away O
. O
Our O
unfortunately O
attempting O
to O
walk O
was O
merely O
accident O
, O
and O
occasioned O
entirely O
by O
my O
foolish O
impatience O
to O
get O
away O
from O
the O
place O
before O
Mr. O
Smith S-PERSON
, O
the O
miller O
, O
who O
took O
me O
there O
, O
thought O
his O
horse O
sufficiently O
rested O
to O
return O
. O
" O
" O
Mr. O
Smith S-PERSON
, O
the O
miller O
? O
Then O
for O
certain O
all's O
right O
— O
for O
they O
be O
known O
for O
the O
greatest O
of O
friends O

Mr. O

he O
— O

I O
dare O
say O
my O
husband O

ma'am O
, O
would O
be O
proud O
to O
help O
you O
when O
he O
comes O
home O

It's O
coming O
dark O
fast O
, O
and O
he O
won't O
be O
long O
I O
dare O
say O
. O
" O
" O
But O
I O
must O
go O
back O
to O
this O
poor O
child O

left O
her O
with O
an O
old O
lady O

so O
long O

Mary S-PERSON

" O
Poor O

her O
limping O
guide O

from O
the O
moment O

the O
woman O

but O
by O
no O
means O
harshly O

and O
as O
she O
spoke O
, O
she O
dropped O
into O
the O
maniac's O
lap O
a O
piece O
of O
bread O
that O
lay O
in O
a O

" O

said O
poor O
Sally S-PERSON

nodding O
her O
head O
with O
a O
sort O
of O
boastful O
exultation O

" O
she O
would O
not O

the O

" O
Whereabouts O

they O
, O
ma'am O

" O
demanded O
the O
farmer's O
wife O
. O
ma'am O
, O
as O
you O
walked O
by O
the O
lane O
just O
round O
our O
farm O
, O
and O
them O
trees O
as O
you O
speak O
of O
, O
bean't O
not O
one S-CARDINAL
quarter O
of O
the O
distance O
as O
you O
have O
come O
. O
" O
" O
In O
that O
case O
, O
" O
replied O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
, O
greatly O
comforted O
, O
" O
I O
have O
no O
doubt O
that O
we O
could O
get O
the O
poor O
little O
girl O
here O
, O
and O
then O
if O
you O
would O
give O
us O
leave O
to O
remain O
till O
your O
husband O
has O
contrived O
to O
procure O
some O
sort O
of O
conveyance O
for O
us O
, O
all O
our O
troubles O
would O
be O
over O
, O
and O
most O
gratefully O
will O
I O
repay O
you O
for O
your O
assistance O

" O
" O
I O
will O
show O
you O
the O
way O
this O
moment O
, O
ma'am O
, O
" O
said O
the O
woman O
, O
with O
great O
alacrity O

and O
once O
more O
suspending O
her O
labours O
for O
the O
good O
man's O
supper O
, O
she O
prepared O
to O
attend O
the O
lady O
by O
taking O
off O
an O
external O
apron O
, O
and O
smoothing O
that O
which O
was O
below O
it O
. O
Though O
not O
quite O
within O
a O
stone's O
throw O
, O
the O
spot O
to O
which O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
was O
so O
anxious O
to O
return O
, O
was O
reached O
by O
a O
very O
short O
cut O
across O
the O
piece O
of O
meadow O
- O
ground O
on O
which O
the O
back O
part O
of O
the O
farm O
- O
house O
opened O
. O
The O
joy O
of O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
at O
seeing O
her O
was O
great O
indeed O
| | O
and O
poor O
Fanny S-PERSON
, O
refreshed O
by O
the O
interval O
of O
rest O
, O
declared O
herself O
quite O
able O
to O
walk O
" O
a O
good O
piece O
more O
. O
" O
" O
Poor O
little O
creature O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
good O
Mrs. O
Roberts S-PERSON
, O
the O
farmer's O
wife O
| | O
" O
she O
do O
look O
bad O
, O
sure O
enough O
! O
It O
is O
seldom O
or O
never O
that O
we O
gets O
a O
sight O
of O
the O
children O
at O
the O
mill O
, O
for O
they O
sends O
regular O
for O
what O
they O
wants O
, O

bean't O
over O
fond O
of O
having O
any O
body O
go O
near O
' O
em O

— O
but O
she O
puts O
me O
strongly O
in O
mind O
of O
old O
Sally's S-NORP
stories O
to O
be O
sure O
! O
" O
The O
little O
party O
reached O
the O
farm O
without O
difficulty O
, O
and O
then O
, O
indeed O
, O
as O
Mary S-PERSON
had O
predicted O
, O
all O
their O
present O
troubles O
seemed O
over O
, O
for O
nothing O
could O
exceed O
the O
earnest O
kindness O
with O
which O
Mrs. O
Roberts S-PERSON
administered O
to O
all O
their O
wants O
. O
Mrs. O
Tremlett's S-PERSON
appearance O
and O
manner O
appeared O
to O
have O
entirely O
removed O
the O
sort O
of O
doubtful O
impression O
which O
poor O
Mary's S-PERSON
hurried O
entrée O
had O
produced O
, O
and O
having O
been O
told O
that O
the O
little O
girl O
had O
been O
reclaimed O
by O
them O
as O
a O
relation O
, O
the O
whole O
adventure O
appeared O
to O
her O
as O
one O
of O
the O
deepest O
interest O
, O
and O
her O
sympathy O
and O
good O
- O
will O
were O
most O
fully O
excited O
. O
Old O
Sally S-PERSON
was O
sitting O
upon O
the O
floor O
exactly O
where O
they O
had O
left O
her O
. O
" O
Poor O
thing O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
" O
she O
has O
not O
moved O
an O
inch O
. O
" O
" O
Not O
she O
, O
poor O
soul O
, O
" O
replied O
Mrs. O
Roberts S-PERSON
, O
" O
I O
told O
her O
to O
bide O
still O
, O
and O
when O
we O
says O
that O
to O
her O
, O
she'd O
keep O
still O
, O
if O
we O
was O
to O
be O
away O
a O
whole O
day O
, O
I O
believe O
. O
Get O
up O
, O
Sally S-PERSON
! O
" O
she O
added O
, O
good O
- O
humouredly O
. O
" O
There's O
brave O
woman O
! O
Look O
at O
that O
little O
girl O
, O
and O
tell O
the O
ladies O
what O
she O
puts O
you O
in O
mind O
of O
. O
" O
The O
expression O
of O
the O
poor O
withered O
, O
idiot O
face O
, O
that O
was O
turned O
upon O
Fanny B-PERSON
Fletcher E-PERSON
when O
this O
was O
uttered O
, O
was O
most O
touchingly O
sad O
and O
solemn O
. O
The O
gentle O
, O
silly O
look O
, O
which O
her O
countenance O
usually O
wore O
, O
was O
exchanged O
for O
one O
full O
of O
deep O
mysterious O
meaning O
. O
She O
drew O
herself O
towards O
the O
little O
girl O
with O
a O
sort O
of O
stealthy O
movement O
, O
as O
if O
afraid O
of O
being O
seen O
to O
approach O
her O
, O
and O
when O
quite O
close O
beside O
her O
, O
said O
, O
little O
thing O
! O
Can't O
you O
guess O
what O
will O
come O
next O
? O
Poor O
little O
thing O
! O
They O
will O
catch O
you O
! O
hide O
where O
you O
will O
, O
they O
will O
catch O
you O
. O
" O
" O
I O
have O
not O
run O
away O
, O
" O
said O
Fanny S-PERSON
, O
gently O
. O
The O
maniac O
shook O
her O
head O
. O
" O
Don't O
you O
scream O
as O
I O
did O
, O
my O
poor O
lamb O
, O
for O
it's O
no O
good O
| | O
they O
care O
no O
more O
for O
screams O
and O
groans O
than O
for O
the O
whirring O
of O
the O
spindles O
. O
But O
the O
screams O
went O
into O
my O
own O
ears O
, O
and O
I O
have O
never O
got O
rid O
of O
them O
since O
. O
I O
still O
hear O
them O
, O
all O
night O
long O
, O
when O
it O
is O
moon O
- O
time O

Poor O
, O
poor O
little O
girl O
! O
" O
" O
Come O
, O
come O
Sally S-PERSON
— O
let O
her O
alone O
now O
, O
she O
is O
going O
to O
eat O
something O
. O
" O
And O
Mrs. O
Roberts S-PERSON
completed O
the O
arrangements O
upon O
which O
she O
had O
been O
occupied O
since O
they O
entered O
, O
by O
placing O
chairs O
at O
the O
table O
on O
which O
bread O
, O
butter O
, O
and O
cheese O
, O
were O
placed O
. O
Not O
even O
did O
the O
Deep B-GPE
- I-GPE
Valley E-GPE
apprentice O
feel O
more O
disposed O
to O
do O
justice O
to O
these O
preparations O
than O
did O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
and O
her O
old O
servant O
. O
They O
had O
tasted O
nothing O
since O
breakfast O
, O
and O
when O
a O
bowl O
of O
fresh O
milk O
was O
added O
to O
the O
bread O
- O
and O
- O
butter O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
gratefully O
assured O
her O
entertainer O
that O
she O
considered O
it O
as O
the O
most O
delicious O
supper O
she O
had O
ever O
eaten O
. O
" O
Now O
that's O
different O
, O
" O
said O
poor O
Sally S-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
perched O
herself O
on O
a O
low O
stool O
close O
to O
Fanny B-PERSON
Fletcher E-PERSON
. O
" O
I O
never O
had O
any O
pretty O
creature O
like O
that O
, O
all O
clothed O
in O
heavenly O
trappings O
, O
giving O
me O
milk O

but O
it O
will O
make O
no O
difference O
in O
the O
end O
— O
you O
must O
be O
dragged O
back O
again O
, O
poor O
little O
thing O
! O
" O
" O
No O
, O
no O
— O
she O
won't O
be O
dragged O
back O
again O
, O
" O
said O
Mrs. O
Roberts S-PERSON

" O
and O
there's O
a O
cup O
of O
milk O
for O
you O
— O
so O
now O
let O
the O
ladies O
eat O
in O
peace O

Sally S-PERSON
. O
You O
know O
it's O
time O
for O
you O
to O
be O
crawling O
home O
— O
the O
master O
will O
be O
here O
in O
no O
time O
, O
and O
maybe O
he O
will O
be O
after O
asking O
how O
many O
stones O
you O
have O
picked O
up O
to O
- O
day O
, O
so O
you O
had O
better O
be O
off O

" O
The O
docile O
creature O
immediately O
shuffled O
off O
her O
stool O

prepared O
to O
depart O

" O
I O
should O
like O

hear O
her O
describe O
her O
own O
adventures O

you O
say O
she O
does O
so O
faithfully O

said O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON

" O
Do O
you O
think O
you O
could O
persuade O
her O
to O
repeat O
her O
story O
to O
us O

" O
Yes O

she O
will O
do O

quick O
enough O

just O
what O
she O
likes O

now O

moody O

Sally S-PERSON

if O
you O

behave O
yourself O

sensible O
woman O

you O
may O
sit O
down O
again O

tell O
the O
ladies O
how O
you O
ran O
away O
from O
the O
mill O

was O
caught O

brought O
back O
again O

it O

" O
The O
little O
cripple's O
eyes O
twinkled O

a O
gleam O
of O
intelligence O
flashed O
across O
her O
countenance O

a O
sort O
of O

the O

closely O

sensible O
body O

on O

you O
know O

" O
said O
Mrs. O
Roberts S-PERSON
, O
interposing O
in O
a O
warning O
tone O
, O
which O
poor O
Sally S-PERSON
seemed O
to O
understand O
, O
for O
though O
her O
breast O
still O
heaved O
with O
a O
panting O
movement O
, O
like O
one O
who O
had O
run O
a O
race O
, O
and O
was O
out O
of O
breath O
, O
she O
assumed O
an O
affected O
air O
of O
composure O
, O
putting O
her O
hands O
before O
her O
primly O
, O
and O
shutting O
her O
eyes O
. O
" O
Yes O
, O
mississ O
, O
I O
know O
that O

she O
replied O
, O
sedately O
, O
" O
I O
know O
that O
very O
well O

we O
won't O
trouble O

a O
wise O
woman O

" O
The O
farmer's O
wife O
nodded O
assent O
, O
and O
Sally S-PERSON
continued O
more O
quietly O
. O
wholesome O
sleep O
ever O

I O

all O
my O

used O

the O

hear O
the O
pretty O
sweet O
cows O

mooing O

I O
all O
the O

up O

by O

Sally S-PERSON

interrupted O
Mrs. O

, O
" O
I O
won't O
have O
all O

" O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
ceased O
to O
wonder O
, O
as O
she O
had O
first O
done O
, O
at O
the O
chartered O
licence O
which O
the O
crazy O
cripple O
seemed O
to O
enjoy O
, O
when O
she O
observed O
the O
perfect O
docility O
with O
which O
she O
obeyed O
every O
word O
and O
look O
of O
the O
farmer's O
wife O
. O
She O
now O
resumed O
her O
story O
, O
exactly O
at O
the O
word O
commanded O
. O
" O
Yes O
I O
was O
shut O
up O

my O
dears O
— O
I O
shall O
have O
soon O
done O
now O

I O
am O
coming O
to O
the O
black O
gap O

as O
I O
call O
it O

I O
always O
stops O
there O
— O
but O
where O
do O
you O
think O
they O
shut O
me O
up O
? O
In O
this O
room O
, O
or O
that O
room O

or O
t'other O
room O
, O
perhaps O
? O
Not O
a O
bit O
of O
it O

They O
shut O
me O
up O
in O
a O
little O
narrow O
place O
, O
not O
much O
bigger O
than O
a O
grave O

it O
was O
dark O

dark O
— O
dark O

all O

one O
little O
narrow O

there O
was O
no O

comed O
through O

first S-ORDINAL

by O

by O
, O
after O
I O
had O
been O
days O

days O
locked O
in O

I O
heard O
a O
horrid O
, O
horrid O
lumbering O
noise O
, O
and O
then O
I O
saw O
a O
flash O
of O
light O
through O
the O
narrow O
slip O
, O
for O
all O
the O
world O

the O
light O
of O

the O
light O
of O

it O
was O
too O

you O
think O
it O
showed O
me O

Crippled O

I O

I O
managed O

high O
enough O

peep O

there O
was O

on O

something O

you O
think O
I O
saw O

" O
The O
poor O
creature O
began O
shaking O
again O
, O
but O
on O
Mrs. O
Roberts S-PERSON
holding O
up O
her O
finger O
, O
she O
seemed O
to O
make O
a O
strong O
effort O
to O
control O
herself O
, O
and O
once O
more O
slipping O
off O
her O
stool O
she O
drew O
close O
to O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
, O
and O
in O
a O
low O
rapid O
voice O
, O
hurried O
through O
the O
remainder O
of O
her O
narrative O
. O
" O
I O
saw O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
" O
the O
master's O

Stone O
dead O
! O
Stiffened O

stark O
, O

ghastly O

blue O

was O

flaed O
full O
upon O
her O
dead O
face O

it O

I'm O
sure O
they O
couldn't O
bear O
it O

I O
was O
left O
alone O

could O
not O

it O
either O

it O

must O
not O
scream O
now O

Here O
she O
stopped O

putting O
her O
hands O
before O
her O
eyes O
, O
and O
remaining O
perfectly O
still O
for O
a O
minute O
, O
and O
then O
added O
with O
more O
composure O
, O
growing O
into O
an O
old O
woman O
, O
that O
he O
would O
please O
not O

wake O
me O
in O
the O
morning O

the O
master O

take O
yourself O
off O

a O
good O
woman O

your O
mug O
of O
porridge O

put O
on O
your O
hat O
steady O

wish O
the O
ladies O
a O
good O
night O
. O
" O
Again O
she O
was O
most O
docilely O
obeyed O
, O
and O
in O
another O
moment O
poor O
Sally S-PERSON
was O
gone O
, O
and O
the O
hardworking O
master O
of O
the O
premises O
occupied O
her O
place O
. O
The O
situation O
and O
wants O
of O
his O
unexpected O
guests O
were O
speedily O
explained O
to O
him O
, O
and O
his O
best O
assistance O
as O
speedly O
promised O
. O
While O
he O
devoured O
a O
hasty O
supper O
, O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
his O
farm O
- O
horses O
was O
put O
into O
the O
shafts O
of O
a O
jockey O
- O
cart O
, O
and O
in O
less B-TIME
than I-TIME
an I-TIME
hour E-TIME
after O
his O
return O
, O
the O
comforted O
party O
set O
out O
by O
the O
light O
of O
a O
friendly O
moon O
, O
and O
were O
safely O
jolted O
to O
the B-LOC
King's I-LOC
Head E-LOC
, O
without O
having O
been O
overtaken O
by O
the O
treacherous O
miller O
, O
who O
probably O
preferred O
sharing O
the O
jovial O
supper O
, O
in O
which O
his O
good O
friend O
Woodcomb S-PERSON
indulged O
on O
this O
memorable O
evening O
, O
to O
forsaking O
it O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
overtaking O
the O
ladies O
, O
from O
whom O
it O
was O
derived O
— O
as O
there O
seemed O
but O
little O
chance O
of O
drawing O
any O
thing O
more O
from O
the O
same O
source O
. O
Great O
was O
the O
joy O
of O
Mrs. O
Prescot S-PERSON
at O
seeing O
her O
guests O
return O
| | O
for O
their O
long O
absence O
, O
together O
with O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
business O
on O
which O
they O
were O
engaged O
had O
caused O
the O
good O
woman O
to O
torment O
herself O
with O
many O
dark O
forebodings O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
she O
was O
well O
prepared O
to O
receive O
them O
, O
and O
nothing O
was O
wanting O
that O
she O
could O
furnish O
towards O
refreshing O
the O
adventurers O
after O
their O
fatigue O
. O
But O
, O
alas O
! O
it O
was O
only O
then O
| | O
it O
was O
only O
after O
the O
anxiety O
, O
and O
the O
agitation O
of O
the O
enterprise O
were O
over O
, O
that O
poor O
Mary S-PERSON
fully O
remembered O
how O
abortive O
that O
enterprise O
had O
been O
| | O
and O
then O
she O
wept O
, O
wept O
bitterly O
, O
as O
she O
thought O
of O
the O
load O
of O
anguish O
she O
had O
to O
carry O
home O
to O
Michael's S-PERSON
mother O
and O
brother O
. O
Yet O
as O
she O
listened O
to O
little O
Fanny's S-PERSON
tearful O
narration O
of O
all O
that O
had O
passed O
between O
them O
, O
during O
the O
weeks O
the O
had O
worked O
together O
, O
she O
felt O
that O
when O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
dreadful O
pang O
should O
be O
over O
, O
there O
would O
be O
something O
like O
consolation O
for O
them O
in O
listening O
to O
it O
also O
| | O
and O
as O
she O
studied O
the O
delicate O
and O
expressive O
features O
of O
the O
pretty O
creature O
she O
had O
rescued O
, O
and O
watched O
the O
sort O
of O
timid O
, O
doubting O
hope O
, O
that O
by O
degrees O
took O
place O
of O
the O
nervous O
, O
heart O
- O
struck O
look O
, O
that O
had O
been O
so O
painfully O
legible O
in O
her O
sweet O
face O
when O
first S-ORDINAL
she O
saw O
her O
, O
it O
was O
impossible O
not O
to O
feel O
that O
while O
deploring O
the O
loss O
of O
one S-CARDINAL
object O
of O
benevolence O
, O
she O
had O
to O
rejoice O
for O
having O
found O
another O
. O
Luckily O
for O
the O
respectability O
of O
their O
appearance O
, O
in O
setting O
forth O
on O
their O
homeward O
travels O
the B-TIME
following I-TIME
morning E-TIME
, O
the O
active O
Mrs. O
prescot O
was O
enabled O
, O
by O
the O
aid O
of O
the O
heiress's O
magic O
pocket O
- O
book O
, O
to O
procure O
from O
a O
neighbour O
a O
suit O
of O
decent O
apparel O
for O
the O
little O
orphan O
. O
The O
same O
freely O

flowing O
source O
supplied O
wherewithal O
to O
reward O
all O
the O
friendly O
offices O
performed O
by O
the O
host O

and O
in O
addition O
, O
they O
were O
left O
in O
possession O
of O
a O
romance O
which O
was O
likely O
enough O
, O
from O
the O
frequency O
with O
which O
it O
was O
repeated O
, O
to O
furnish O
a O
legend O
to O
the O
little O
village O
to O
the O
end O
of O
time O

which O
though O
forming O
a O
very O
isolated O
episode O
in O
the O
history O
of O
her O
journey O
, O
shall O
be O
recounted O
, O
because O
the O
fact O
which O
it O
brought O
to O
her O
knowledge O
is O
one O
that O
well O
deserves O
publicity O

heiress O
varied O
her O
road O
homewards O

by O
driving O
through O
a O
village O

not O
infested O
by O
the O
plague O

spot O
of O
a O
factory O

might O
be O
considered O
as O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
most O
attractive O
in O
Derbyshire S-GPE

At O
one S-CARDINAL
point O
the O
road O

little O
Fanny S-PERSON
, O
though O
in O
her O
heart O
longing O
to O
spring O
after O

the O
observation O

that O
she O
was O
not O

strong O

by O
a O
look O

spoke O
more O
of O
gratitude O

regret O

It O
was O
alone O
, O
therefore O
, O
that O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton E-PERSON
started O
forward O
, O
her O
active O
steps O
soon O
leaving O
the O
carriage O
behind O

when O
cutting O
short O
the O
spiral O
ascent O
by O
making O
her O
way O
through O
the O
underwood O
which O
clothed O
the O
bank O
, O
she O
soon O
found O
herself O
high O
above O
the O
road O
, O
and O
on O
spot O
of O
great O
beauty O
. O
After O
lingering O
here O
for O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes E-TIME
she O
proceeded O
. O
when O
hearing O
the O
ever O
attractive O
sound O
of O
rushing O
waters O
, O
she O
again O
stopped O
, O
and O
then O
, O
guided O
by O
her O
ear O
, O
followed O
where O
it O
led O
, O
till O
she O
reached O
an O
opening O
, O
not O
far O
from O
the O
high O
- O
road O
, O
but O
apart O
from O
it O
, O
where O
, O
instead O
of O
the O
mountain O
cascade O
she O
had O
expected O
, O
a O
spectacle O
greeted O
her O
that O
for O
an O
instant O
seemed O
to O
petrify O
every O
nerve O
, O
and O
the O
bounding O
elastic O
movement O
which O
had O
brought O
her O
within O
sight O
of O
it O
, O
was O
changed O
to O
the O
rigid O
stillness O
of O
Marble S-PERSON
. O
A O
man O
, O
almost O
ferocious O
in O
his O
aspect O
, O
from O
the O
squalid O
, O
unshorn O
, O
brutal O
negligence O
of O
decency O
which O
it O
betrayed O
, O
was O
supporting O
in O
his O
arms O
, O
and O
on O
his O
of O
of O
ten B-DATE
or I-DATE
eleven I-DATE
years I-DATE
old E-DATE
, O
whose O
ghastly O
countenance O
showed O
plainly O
that O
death O
was O
busy O
at O
his O
heart O
. O
Before O
the O
rock O
from O
whence O
flowed O
the O
gushing O
stream O
, O
whose O
sound O
had O
brought O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
to O
the O
spot O
, O
stood O
what O
looked O
like O
the O
fragment O
of O
a O
rude O
pillar O
, O
and O
on O
this O
stone O
the O
father O
had O
rested O
the O
wasted O
from O
of O
his O
dying O
child O
. O
Before O
him O
stood O
a O
little O
girl O
gazing O
on O
the O
boy O
with O
a O
mixture O
of O
infant O
fear O
a O
sisterly O
love O
, O
as O
she O
tended O
a O
bowl O
, O
filled O
from O
the O
spring O
, O
to O
his O
lips O
. O
" O
He O
is O
very O
ill O
! O
" O
said O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
addressing O
the O
father O
, O
" O
can O
I O
go O
any O
where O
to O
get O
help O
for O
you O
? O
" O
The O
man O
, O
who O
had O
the O
fragment O
of O
a O
pipe O
in O
his O
mouth O
, O
and O
who O
looked O
rather O
bewildered O
, O
and O
fiercely O
angry O
, O
than O
oppressed O
by O
sorrow O
, O
stared O
at O
her O
, O
but O
answered O
not O
a O
word O
. O
" O
What O
is O
the O
matter O
with O
him O
? O
" O
said O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
, O
addressing O
the O
little O
girl O
. O
it O
. O
Mother O
said O
, O
when O
we O
started O
, O
that O
he O
looked O
as O
if O
he'd O
never O
come O
back O
alive O
| | O
but O
he'd O
have O
had O
to O
pay O
double O
fine O
if O
so O
be O
as O
father O
had O
left O
him O
to O
bide O
at O
home O
, O
so O
he O
carried O
him O
to O
mill O
| | O
but O
though O
they O
strapped O
him O
, O
and O
strapped O
him O
, O
he O
couldn't O
stand O
to O
his O
work O
. O
and O
he O
have O
been O
lying O
in O
the O
mill O
- O
yard O
till O
father O
comed O
to O
take O
him O
. O
" O
This O
horrible O
statement O
was O
uttered O
amidst O
tears O
and O
sobs O
, O
but O
poor O
Mary S-PERSON
lost O
not O
a O
word O
of O
it O
| | O
and O
as O
her O
very O
soul O
sickened O
at O
the O
tale O
, O
she O
felt O
tempted O
to O
believe O
that O
she O
was O
doomed O
to O
witness O
every O
circumstance O
that O
could O
most O
painfully O
recall O
the O
source O
whence O
all O
her O
greatness O
flowed O
. O
With O
clasped O
hands O
, O
and O
streaming O
eyes O
, O
she O
stood O
silently O
watching O
the O
gasping O
breath O
of O
this O
young O
victim O
of O
unnatural O
labour O
. O
The O
boy's O
eyes O
fixed O
themselves O
on O
the O
face O
of O
his O
little O
sister O
. O
He O
might O
be O
listening O
to O
her O
history O
of O
his O
early O
fate O
— O
or O
he O
might O
be O
consciously O
taking O
a O
last O
look O
at O
what O
he O
loved O
. O
In O
either O
case O
the O
effort O
demanded O
more O
strength O
than O
was O
left O
him O
— O
his O
eyes O
closed O
, O
a O
shivering O
movement O
passed O
through O
all O
his O
frame O
, O
and O
then O
he O
became O
still O
. O
The O
quick O
, O
short O
, O
unequal O
heaving O
of O
the O
breast O
was O
seen O
no O
more O
, O
and O
Mary S-PERSON
hid O
her O
eyes O
as O
the O
mysterious O
change O
, O
which O
no O
human O
being O
can O
gaze O
upon O
unmoved O
, O
come O
upon O
the O
stiffening O
features O
. O
It O
was O
rather O
instinct O
than O
feeling O
, O
which O
prompted O
her O
even O
at O
that O
awful O
moment O
to O
proffer O
what O
she O
had O
learned O
to O
know O
would O
be O
felt O
as O
consolation O
, O
did O
one S-CARDINAL
starving O
member O
of O
a O
family O
alone O
survive O
amidst O
the O
dying O
and O
the O
dead O
of O
a O
whole O
race O
. O
Without O
venturing O
again O
to O
look O
at O
the O
father O
and O
his O
son O
she O
dropped O
into O
the O
bowl O
, O
which O
the O
little O
girl O
still O
held O
, O
what O
she O
hated O
to O
think O
would O
soon O
turn O
natural O
sorrow O
into O
unnatural O
forgetfulness O
of O
it O
: O
but O
she O
had O
no O
power O
to O
serve O
them O
more O
effectually O
, O
and O
hastily O
turning O
into O
the O
road O
, O
she O
awaited O
the O
slow O
arrival O
of O
the O
post O
- O
chaise O
in O
a O
state O
of O
mind O
which O
left O
no O
faculty O
at O
leisure O
to O
enjoy O
and O
longer O
the O
hills O

valleys O
for O
whose O
sake O
she O
had O
left O
it O

From O
this O
time O
the O
journey O
homeward O
proceeded O
without O
accident O
or O
adventure O
of O

Mary S-PERSON

probably O
have O
shared O
the O
pleasure O
so O
energetically O
expressed O
by O
Mr. O

restored O

painful O
day O

all O

Fanny B-PERSON

fared O
in O
her O
new O

most O
strange O

most O
reason O

bless O

sudden O

CHAPTER O
XXV O

THE O
NARRATIVE O
RETURNS O
TO O
ITS O
HERO O
— O
AND O
RELATES O
WHY O
AND O
WHEREFORE O
HE O
WAS O
KEPT O
ALIVE O
— O
THE O
BOY O
GROWS O
TALL O
, O
AND O
TAKES O
TO O
THINKING O
. O
The O
answer O
which O
Fanny B-PERSON
Fletcher E-PERSON
had O
received O
to O
her O
inquiries O
concerning O
Michael S-PERSON
was O
as O
false O
as O
it O
was O
heedless O
. O
The O
little O
fellow O
who O
gave O
it O
had O
no O
intention O
of O
uttering O
what O
was O
untrue O
: O
he O
believed O
that O
the O
boy O
she O
inquired O
for O
was O
dead O
— O
so O
many O
had O
died O
and O
been O
borne O
from O
the O
wretched O
garret O
where O
he O
had O
himself O
lain O
, O
battling O
with O
the O
fever O
, O
sometimes O
delirious O
, O
and O
sometimes O
asleep O
, O
that O
it O
was O
no O
great O
wonder O
he O
should O
blunder O
. O
But O
Michael B-PERSON
Armstrong E-PERSON
was O
not O
dead O
, O
though O
the O
state O
in O
which O
the O
malady O
left O
him O
was O
such O
, O
that O
for O
weeks S-DATE
the O
surly O
old O
woman O
, O
hired O
to O
supply O
the O
place O
of O
Mrs O
Poulet S-PERSON
, O
muttered O
curses O
on O
him O
for O
not O
being O
in O
a O
state O
to O
be O
quietly O
buried O
out O
of O
the O
way O
, O
like O
the O
rest O
. O
It O
was O
just B-DATE
five I-DATE
days E-DATE
after O
Fanny B-PERSON
Fletcher E-PERSON
left O
the B-ORG
Deep I-ORG
Valley I-ORG
Mills E-ORG
in O
company O
with O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
, O
that O
Michael S-PERSON
waked O
from O
that O
first S-ORDINAL
sound O
healing O
sleep O
, O
which O
often O
announces O
the O
conquest O
of O
life O
over O
death O
, O
after O
a O
hard O
- O
fought O
struggle O
between O
them O
. O
The O
little O
fellow O
raised O
himself O
upright O
on O
his O
straw O
pallet O
, O
and O
for O
a B-TIME
minute E-TIME
or O
two S-CARDINAL
looked O
about O
him O
to O
make O
himself O
quite O
sure O
where O
he O
was O
| | O
for O
so O
heavy O
had O
been O
his O
sleep O
that O
it O
was O
not O
immediately O
his O
senses O
could O
recover O
their O
usual O
powers O
of O
perception O
. O
But O
only O
too O
soon O
, O
alas O
! O
he O
made O
it O
all O
out O
. O
He O
was O
still O
in O
that O
foul O
den O
of O
misery O
and O
filth O
| | O
and O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
impulse O
of O
his O
fully O
- O
recovered O
intellect O
was O
to O
utter O
a O
bitter O
expression O
of O
regret O
that O
his O
life O
had O
been O
spared O
for O
further O
suffering O
, O
while O
so O
many O
had O
been O
mercifully O
permitted O
to O
sink O
into O
their O
peaceful O
graves O
. O
But O
even O
as O
he O
breathed O
the O
words O
, O
he O
repented O
of O
them O
. O
The O
image O
of O
his O
mother O
seemed O
to O
rise O
before O
him O
— O
he O
remembered O
that O
she O
had O
bade O
him O
ever O
to O
trust O
in O
God O
, O
and O
let O
no O
cause O
tempt O
him O
to O
take O
his O
name O
in O
vain O
. O
The O
quiet O
eye O
of O
his O
much O
- O
enduring O
brother O
rose O
to O
his O
memory O
, O
as O
he O
had O
seen O
it O
a B-CARDINAL
thousand E-CARDINAL
times O
fixed O
upon O
him O
, O
while O
he O
enjoined O
patience O
and O
submission O
for O
their O
dear O
mother's O
sake O
| | O
and O
the O
more O
recently O
heard O
precepts O
of O
little O
Fanny S-PERSON
, O
all O
preaching O
the O
same O
righteous O
, O
but O
hard O
lesson O
, O
came O
in O
their O
soft O
pleading O
, O
innocent O
tone O
to O
give O
him O
strength O
to O
bear O
. O
Michael S-PERSON
crossed O
his O
emaciated O
hands O
upon O
his O
breast O
, O
and O
murmured O
" O
God O
forgive O
me O
! O
" O
— O
then O
dropping O
again O
into O
a O
gentle O
sleep O
, O
awoke O
not O
, O
till O
the O
old O
woman O
shook O
him O
rudely O
, O
rather O
for O
the O
gratification O
of O
her O
curiosity O
, O
than O
in O
performance O
of O
her O
duty O
, O
in O
order O
to O
see O
whether O
the O
" O
wiry O
, O
hard O
- O
skinned O
little O
varment O
wasn't O
dead O
at O
last O
. O
" O
his O
large O
eyes O
upon O
her O
, O
asked O
her O
to O
please O
to O
be O
so O
kind O
as O
to O
give O
him O
a O
drink O
of O
water O
. O
" O
What O
, O
then O
! O
— O
you O
don't O
mean O
to O
die O
after O
all O

" O
There's O
a O

as O
have O
been O
lying O
a O
dying O
amost O
ever O

I O
comed O
, O
as O
is O
actually O
coming O

now O

not O

what O
he O
must O
still O
be O
within O
an O
inch O
of O
the O
grave O
, O
seeing O
what O
he O
has O
gone O
through O
— O
and O
he O
looks O
for O
all O
the O
world O
as O
if O
he O
had O
been O
buried O
and O
dug O
up O
again O

Howsomever O
I O
don't O
think O
but O
what O
he O
might O
come O
through O
, O
if O
so O
be O
as O
I O
you O
thought O
it O
worth O
while O
to O
give O
him O
food O
. O
That O
sort O
of O
sleep O
as O
I O
waked O
him O
out O
of O
, O
shows O
plain O
enough O
as O
the O
fever O
is O
gone O

then O
you O
know O
, O
sir O
, O
as O
kitchen O
physic O
is O
all O
the O
cretur's O
wants O
, O
perhaps O
, O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
preventing O
the O
burying O
beginning O
again O
, O
your O
honour O
might O
think O
it O
was O
as O
well O
to O
give O
him O
a O
little O
broth O
, O
and O
meat O
, O
too O
, O
after O
a O
bit O
, O
for O
he O
won't O
do O
without O
it O
, O
that's O
certain O
. O
" O
" O
I O
had O
clean O
forgot O

in O
Heaven's S-PERSON

now O

for O
ever O

— O
he'll O
come O
round O
again O

I O
suppose O
before O
its O
very O
long O
? O
We O
are O
still O
very O
short O
of O
piecers O

and O
it's O
as O
well O
to O
keep O
him O
alive O
, O
you O
know O
, O
as O
to O
go O
after O
another O

" O
" O
As O
for O
that O
, O
sir O

replied O
the O
old O
woman O

" O
it O
won't O
be O

either O

as O
he'll O
pay O
for O
his O
salt O

I'll O
tell O
you O
that O
beforehand O

So O
you O
had O
best O
please O
to O
make O
up O
your O
mind O
at O
once O
about O
the O
keeping O
him O
alive O

There's O
nothing O
will O
do O
it O
but O
giving O
him O
amost O
a O
bellyful O
every O
day O
, O
and O
maybe O
a O
little O
fresh O
air O
into O
the O
bargain O
, O
I'm O
thinking O
, O
seeing O
the O
time O
he's O
laid O
stewing O
up O
there O
, O
with O
such O
lots O
dying O
all O
round O
him O

" O
" O
If O
it O
wasn't O
for O
the O
having O
to O
open O
ground O
for O
him O
again O
, O
I'd O
be O
hanged O
, O
drawn O

quartered O
, O
before O
I'd O
trouble O
myself O
about O
what O
sort O
of O
air O
a O
' O
prentice O
had O
to O
breath O

Howsomever S-PERSON
, O
I O
have O
got O
my O
own O
reasons O
for O
not O
choosing O
to O
trouble O
the O
parson O
again O
, O
nor O
yet O
for O
doing O
the O
job O
without O
him O

So O
cram O
the O
brat O
as O
much O
a O
you O
like O

I O
suppose O
my O
leavings O
is O
good O
enough O
for O
him O

" O
" O
Please O
master O
not O
to O
talk O
for O
my O
liking O

cram O

retorted O
Molly S-PERSON

" O
Often O

often O

I've O
been O
back O

forward O
here O

for O
one S-CARDINAL

another O

nobody O
ever O
saw O
me O
trying O

pilfer O
any O

their O
starving O

the O
low O
creturs O

I O
dispises O

I O
knows O
what O
will O
save O
life O

what O
will O
lose O
it O
, O
better O
, O
maybe O
, O
than O
most O
folks O

and O
so O
now O
you O
may O
do O
just O
as O
you O
please O

without O
putting O
it O
upon O
my O

I O
knows O
ye O

better O

to O
put O
any O
such O

You O
just O
stop O
the O
creature O
from O
dying O

if O
you O
can O
for O
that O
will O
suit O

" O
The O
will O
of O
Mr. O
Woodcomb S-PERSON
, O
thus O
clearly O
expressed O
, O
was O
acted O
upon O
with O
very O
implicit O
obedience O

the O
consequence O

was O

Michael B-PERSON

from O

Molly B-PERSON
Bing E-PERSON

judgment O

the O
result O

his O
case O
, O

in O
order O
to O
prove O
it O
correct O
, O
she O
contrived O
that O
he O
should O
swallow O
about B-CARDINAL
ten E-CARDINAL
times O
as O
much O
nourishment O
as O
fell O
to O
the O
share O
of O
any O
other O
child O

the O

He O
had O
grown O
surprisingly O
during O
the O
period O
of O
his O
confinement O
, O
and O
this O
gave O
so O
lengthy O
a O
look O
to O
his O
thin O
person O
, O
that O
Molly S-PERSON
more O
than O
once O
fancied O
the O
audacious O
little O
villain O
would O
give O
her O
the O
lie O
at O
last O

so O
she O
not O

fed O
him O

him O

clean O
out O

up O

however O
unsavoury O

in O
communicating O

necessity O

work O

ill O

his O
gaze O

pretty O
creature O

sought O

a O
death O

blow O

joy O

a B-TIME

had O
given O
him O
a O
gait O

an O
expression O

countenance O
so O
unwonted O
in O
a O
factory O

returning O
to O
his O
well O

known O
sufferings O

Nevertheless O
, O
though O
a O
tear O
blinded O
the O
eyes O

at O
length O
settled O
reluctantly O
on O
the O
broken O
threads O
which O
awaited O
his O
fingers O
, O
he O
remembered O
that O
the O
factory O
had O
seven S-CARDINAL
floors O
, O
and O
cruel O
as O
it O
was O
to O
lose O
the O
pleasure O
of O
giving O
his O
little O
friend O
a O
look O
or O
a O
word O
as O
they O
each O
paced O
their O
weary O
walk O
, O
he O
still O
thought O
he O
might O
get O
a O
sight O
of O
her O
at O
their O
dismal O
meals O
, O
and O
fancied O
that O
he O
should O
not O
greatly O
regret O
exchanging O
scraps O
of O
wholesome O
meat O
, O
for O
musty O
oatmeal O

Fanny B-PERSON
Fletcher E-PERSON
was O
by O
to O
tell O
him O
not O
to O
mind O
it O
. O
But O
the O
musty O
oatmeal O
came O
all O
too O
soon O
, O
for O
no O
word O
or O
look O
of O
Fanny's S-PERSON
came O
with O
it O

nor O
did O
any O
uncertainty O
long O
remain O

to O
hang O
a O
lingering O
hope O
that O
some O
unfinished O
task O
detained O
her O
in O
the O
mill O

that O
he O
should O
see O
her O
soon O

His O
first S-ORDINAL
question O
, O
whispered O
to O
the O
girl O
who O
sat O
beside O
him O
, O
brought O
forth O
the O
history O
of O
Fanny's S-PERSON
wonderful O
departure O
, O
at O
as O
full O
length O
as O
the O
time O
and O
place O
would O
permit O
. O
At O
first S-ORDINAL
he O
listened O
to O
it O
with O
incredulity O
. O
It O
seemed O
, O
he O
thought O
, O
like O
a O
story O
made O
up O
to O
deceive O
him O
for O
fun O

little O

the O
blighted O
young O
spirits O
of O
that O
sad O
fraternity O

given O
to O
jesting O

Michael S-PERSON
clung O
to O
the O
belief O
that O
such O
was O
the O
case O

as O
long O
as O
the O
meal O
lasted O

, O
as O
usual O
, O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME

an O
indulgence O
which O
necessarily O
arose O
from O
the O
fact O
, O
that O
even O
the O
niggardly O
allowance O
of O
time O
awarded O
by O
the O
regulations O
of O
Mr. O
Elgood B-PERSON
Sharpton E-PERSON
for O
their O
meals O
, O
was O
more O
than O
the O
famished O
children O
required O
for O
devouring O
the O
the O
scanty O
portion O
set O
before O
them O
. O
No O
sooner O
had O
Mr. O
Poulet S-PERSON
withdrawn O
himself O
, O
after O
witnessing O
the O
orderly O
consumption O
by O
each O
, O
of O
the O
allotted O
morsel O
, O
than O
such O
of O
the O
miserable O
crew O
as O
had O
survived O
the O
pestilence O
, O
and O
remembered O
the O
close O
alliance O
between O
Michael S-PERSON
and O
the O
heroine O
of O
the O
marvellous O
tale O
which O
was O
still O
in O
every O
mouth O
, O
all O
rushed O
together O
towards O
him O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
recounting O
it O
. O
Notwithstanding O
the O
confusion O
of O
tongues O
, O
their O
noisy O
testimony O
was O
too O
consistent O
to O
admit O
of O
doubt O
, O
and O
Michael S-PERSON
remained O
with O
the O
astounding O
belief O
that O
his O
little O
friend O
was O
taken O
away O
to O
be O
made O
a O
great O
lady O
of O
. O
seemed O
" O
lord O
of O
all O
, O
" O
the O
generous O
heart O
of O
Michael S-PERSON
felt O
thankful O
that O
Fanny B-PERSON
Fletcher E-PERSON
shared O
in O
it O
no O
longer O
. O
It O
had O
been O
quite O
in O
vain O
that O
he O
had O
laboured O
to O
persuade O
himself O
, O
while O
listening O
to O
the O
reasonings O
of O
his O
little O
friend O
, O
that O
they O
ought O
mutually O
to O
rejoice O
in O
the O
probability O
of O
each O
other's O
death O
. O
Though O
he O
had O
allowed O
that O
as O
far O
as O
he O
was O
himself O
concerned O
he O
might O
easily O
be O
brought O
to O
think O
that O
it O
would O
be O
a O
comfort O
to O
die O
, O
he O
could O
never O
reach O
the O
pitch O
of O
sublimity O
necessary O
to O
form O
the O
wish O
that O
Fanny S-PERSON
might O
die O
before O
him O
. O
But O
now O
it O
was O
evident O
that O
this O
weakness O
, O
which O
had O
more O
than O
once O
caused O
his O
little O
monitress O
to O
shake O
her O
head O
and O
say O
that O
he O
did O
not O
love O
her O
as O
well O
as O
she O
loved O
him O
, O
it O
was O
now O
quite O
evident O
that O
it O
was O
no O
selfish O
motive O
which O
had O
caused O
it O
. O
By O
degrees O
this O
truly O
noble O
feeling O
, O
this O
generous O
power O
of O
living O
, O
as O
it O
were O
, O
in O
the O
prosperity O
of O
another O
, O
so O
strengthened O
the O
character O
of O
the O
boy O
, O
as O
perfectly O
to O
save O
him O
from O
that O
worst O
result O
of O
youthful O
suffering O
, O
a O
reckless O
, O
desperate O
despair O
, O
which O
by O
destroying O
hope O
, O
that O
beautiful O
mainspring O
of O
all O
our O
best O
actions O
, O
leaves O
the O
poor O
spiritless O
machine O
alive O
only O
to O
wretched O
consciousness O
of O
its O
capacity O
for O
pain O
. O
It O
is O
, O
beyond O
all O
question O
, O
this O
bitter O
hopelessness O
which O
deteriorates O
in O
so O
remarkable O
a O
manner O
the O
moral O
character O
of O
operatives O
under O
the O
present O
factory O
system O

In O
no O
other O
situation O

only O
that O

purchased O

paid O
for O
like O
an O
ox O

is O
the O
destiny O
of O
a O
human O
being O
placed O
so O
wholly O

completely O
beyond O
the O

He O

Wordsworth S-PERSON

It O
was O
long O

very O
long O
, O
ere O
this O
intellectual O
blight O
, O
this O
smothering O
mildew O
of O
the O
soul O
fell O
upon O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
for O
he O
seemed O
to O
possess O
a O
sort O
of O
twofold O
existance O
, O
" O
the O
worser O
half O
of O
it O
, O
" O
being O
his O
poor O
self O
, O
while O
the O
better O
was O
found O
in O
the O
happy O
destiny O
of O
Fanny S-PERSON
. O
Countless O
were O
the O
miles O
that O
he O
walked O
backwards O
and O
forwards O
hefore O
the O
mules O
, O
during O
which O
he O
cheered O
his O
fancy O
by O
painting O
her O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
liberty O
and O
green O
fields O
. O
Sometimes O
he O
thought O
that O
if O
she O
were O
rich O
, O
she O
would O
remember O
all O
he O
had O
told O
her O
about O
his O
mother O
and O
Edward S-PERSON
— O
that O
she O
would O
find O
them O
out O
— O
would O
take O
compassion O
on O
their O
poverty O
— O
would O
talk O
of O
him O
— O
would O
sooth O
and O
comfort O
them O
. O
All O
this O
may O
seem O
, O
to O
happier O
beings O
, O
but O
a O
frail O
support O
, O
under O
incessant O
labour O
, O
accompanied O
by O
every O
species O
of O
privation O
, O
yet O
it O
did O
Michael S-PERSON
service O
— O
it O
kept O
his O
faculties O
alive O
| | O
for O
it O
gave O
a O
theme O
, O
and O
a O
pleasant O
one O
, O
on O
which O
to O
fix O
his O
thoughts O
, O
and O
half S-CARDINAL
the O
the O
tedium O
of O
his O
own O
sad O
life O
was O
forgotten O
, O
as O
he O
meditated O
on O
the O
probable O
happiness O
of O
hers O
. O
Sometimes O
, O
it O
must O
be O
owned O
, O
— O
though O
he O
always O
told O
himself O
that O
such O
thoughts O
were O
nonsense O
, O
— O
ideas O
would O
suggest O
themselves O
less O
abstractedly O
disinterested O

for O
it O
would O
now O
and O
then O
come O
into O
his O
head O
, O
that O
Fanny B-PERSON
Fletcher E-PERSON
knew O
where O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
had O
sent O
him O
, O
if O
nobody O
else O
did O
| | O
and O
that O
, O
perhaps O
, O
if O
she O
grew O
to O
be O
a O
great O
girl O
, O
with O
power O
to O
do O
what O
she O
liked O
, O
she O
might O
think O
of O
him O
, O
and O
try O
to O
do O
something O
to O
rescue O
him O
. O
Vague O
as O
was O
this O
notion O
, O
vague O
as O
he O
himself O
felt O
it O
to O
be O
, O
it O
was O
a O
blessing O
to O
him O

When O
such O
thoughts O
arose O
, O
his O
bodily O
strength O
seemed O
to O
revive O
, O
his O
aching O
knees O
no O
longer O
bent O
under O
him O

his O
gait O
was O
no O

of O
an O
ordinary O
factory O

child O
, O
the O
energy O
of O
his O
mind O
lent O
itself O
to O
his O
limbs O

and O
wearily O
as O
he O
stretched O
himself O
upon O
his O
bed O
of O

and O
long O

lanky O
as O
his O
half O

Michael B-PERSON

did O
not O

But O
years S-DATE

and O
the O
stout O

hearted O
young O
prisoner O
of O
the B-LOC
Deep I-LOC

began O
again O

fever O

lived O

hoping O

him O

" O
I O
am O
a O
fool O

" O
argued O
Michael S-PERSON
at O
fourteen S-DATE

— O
" O
I O
am O
a O
fool O

my O
poor O
Edward S-PERSON

she O
never O
gave O
a O

either O

us O

I O
was O
a O
fool O

dream O
it O

The O
fine O
folks O
that O
carried O
her O

took O
her O
far O
enough O
from O
sight O

And O
who O
can O
blame O
her O

she O
never O
turned O
her O

She O
was O
very O
kind O

the O

ever O

other O

" O
This O
resolution O
was O
not O
very O
steadily O
adhered O
to O

but O
the O
struggle O
to O
do O
it O
, O
which O
was O
perfectly O
sincere O
, O
made O
the O
poor O
boy O
moody O

and O
more O
miserable O
than O
ever O

His O
dreams O
perpetually O
represented O
to O
him O
his O
mother O

helpless O
brother O

suffering O
from O
some O

more O
superlatively O
hard O

hearted O
still O
. O
These O
nervous O
and O
irritating O
visitations O
brought O
his O
mother O

brother O
so O
vividly O
before O
him O

that O
for O
weeks S-DATE
he O
could O
never O

whether O
waking O

get O
them O
out O

his O

He O
fancied O
himself O
again O
running O
at O
full O

from O
Dowling B-FAC

with O

his O
mother's O
little O

decent O

back O

He O
saw O
the O

felt O
the O
welcome O

he O

as O
these O

name O
, O
though O
in O
a O
whisper O
too O
low O
to O
awaken O
the O
weary O
sleepers O
round O
him O
, O
wrung O
his O
very O
heart O
by O
the O
vivid O
recollections O
which O
it O
brought O
, O
and O
though O
he O
was O
now O
beyond O
fourteen B-DATE
years I-DATE
old E-DATE
, O
he O
cried O
himself O
to O
sleep O
. O
Fitful O
and O
feverish O
were O
the O
transitions O
of O
his O
mind O
at O
this O
period O
. O
Sometimes O
he O
persuaded O
himself O
that O
his O
mother O
was O
no O
more O
, O
that O
the O
loss O
of O
him O
had O
broken O
her O
heart O
, O
and O
that O
she O
had O
died O
, O
believing O
him O
to O
have O
gone O
before O
her O
. O
At O
other O
times O
it O
was O
Edward S-PERSON
whom O
he O
wept O
as O
dead O
. O
His O
shattered O
health O
, O
his O
feeble O
limbs O
were O
, O
as O
he O
thought O
, O
sure O
evidence O
that O
nature O
meant O
him O
not O
to O
struggle O
long O
against O
the O
misery O
of O
his O
lot O
, O
and O
there O
were O
moments O
in O
which O
this O
persuasion O
even O
soothed O
him O
. O
" O
Sweet O
fellow O
! O
" O
thought O
he O
. O
" O
How O
calm O
and O
beautiful O
he O
must O
have O
looked O
in O
death O
! O
Even O
in O
suffering O
, O
even O
in O
agony O
, O
his O
countenance O
was O
lovely O
— O
so O
patient O
, O
and O
so O
heavenly O
mild O
! O
Better O
, O
far O
better O
he O
should O
die O
, O
than O
live O
a O
factory O
- O
boy O
like O
me O
! O
" O
And O
then O
again O
his O
mood O
would O
change O
, O
and O
he O
had O
for O
ever O
before O
him O
images O
of O
the O
most O
fearful O
destitution O
— O
his O
mother O
starving O
, O
and O
Edward S-PERSON
slowly O
perishing O
beside O
her O
, O
because O
he O
had O
been O
too O
proud O
and O
too O
impatient O
to O
endure O
sundry O
buffetings O
and O
other O
indignities O
, O
which O
, O
when O
put O
in O
competition O
with O
the O
thought O
of O
having O
injured O
them O
, O
dwindled O
into O
petty O
injuries O
, O
which O
he O
deserved O
eternal O
shame O
for O
shrinking O
from O
. O
Dreadful O
were O
the O
hours O
he O
thus O
spent O
! O
and O
, O
fearful O
to O
think O
of O
, O
was O
the O
hopeless O
, O
helpless O
, O
joyless O
, O
comfortless O
existence O
by O
which O
he O
held O
to O
earth O
! O
His O
very O
soul O
sickened O
as O
he O
looked O
around O
him O
, O
and O
read O
in O
every O
withered O
melancholy O
face O
the O
history O
of O
blasted O
youth O
, O
and O
the O
prophecy O
of O
premature O
death O
. O
had O
been O
stronger O
than O
the O
tendency O
of O
his O
employment O
to O
cripple O
his O
limbs O
, O
and O
he O
was O
neither O
deformed O
nor O
stunted O
. O
This O
happy O
exemption O
from O
the O
common O
lot O
, O
was O
doubtless O
greatly O
owing O
to O
the O
pertinacity O
of O
Molly B-PERSON
Bing E-PERSON
, O
in O
proving O
to O
Messrs S-PERSON
. O
Woodcomb S-PERSON
and O
Poulet S-PERSON
that O
she O
was O
no O
fool O
, O
and O
knew O
well O
enough O
what O
she O
was O
about O
. O
This O
steadfastness O
on O
her O
part O
, O
acting O
in O
unison O
with O
the O
superintendent's O
judicious O
objections O
to O
Michael's S-PERSON
being O
buried O
at O
that O
particular O
time O
, O
had O
certainly O
given O
a O
very O
critical O
and O
efficient O
impulse O
to O
the O
vigour O
of O
a O
frame O
of O
great O
natural O
strength O
and O
comeliness O
. O
The O
energetic O
self O
- O
sustaining O
soul O
within O
it O
, O
had O
also O
much O
to O
do O
in O
defying O
the O
paralyzing O
influence O
of O
his O
miserable O
situation O
. O
It O
was O
rarely O
that O
Michael S-PERSON
could O
be O
seen O
to O
drag O
his O
limbs O
along O
, O
even O
in O
the B-TIME
last I-TIME
hours E-TIME
of O
long O
- O
protracted O
labour O
, O
with O
the O

crippled O

dipping O

his O
companions O

A O
broken O

spirited O
child O

his O

permits O

bend O

not O
one O

fifty S-CARDINAL

without O
carrying O
away O
with O
them O
some O
species O
of O
bodily O

. O
But O
let O
the O
reason O
be O
what O
it O
might O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
was O
saved O
from O
this O

and O
though O
exhibiting O
a O
fabric O

composed O
of O
little O

But O
it O
seemed O
as O
if O
the O
inward O
strength O
of O
mental O
suffering O
kept O
pace O
with O
this O
vigour O
of O
frame O
| | O
for O
day O
by O
day O
the O
bitter O
consciousness O
of O
his O
own O
wretched O
and O
degraded O
state O
increased O
upon O
him O
— O
and O
day O
by O
day O
his O
swelling O
heart O
grew O
more O
indignant O
as O
he O
looked O
around O
him O
, O
and O
watched O
the O
exercise O
of O
lawless O
power O
and O
coward O
tyranny O
upon O
his O
miserable O
companions O
. O
It O
was O
after O
a O
peculiarly O
hateful O
display O
of O
this O
power O
, O
by O
an O
act O
of O
insult O
too O
disgustiug O
to O
relate O
, O
upon O
the O
unresisting O
person O
of O
a O
little O
fellow O
who O
seemed O
crawling O
( O
only O
too O
slowly O

) O
to O
the O
grave O
, O
that O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
when O
every O
other O
sufferer O
in O
the O
chamber O
was O
fast O
asleep O
, O
set O
himself O
to O
meditate O
gravely O
and O
deliberately O
upon O
his O
own O
situation O
. O
He O
had O
that O
day O
been O
so O
near O
trying O
the O
power O
of O
his O
bony O
arms O
, O
by O
flying O
at O
the O
throat O
of O
the O
ruffian O
who O
had O
so O
revoltingly O
outraged O
his O
companion O
, O
that O
with O
more O
than O
boyish O
judgment O
he O
became O
conscious O
of O
the O
growing O
danger O
that O
beset O
him O
. O
Though O
he O
had O
felt O
almost O
to O
suffocation O
the O
boiling O
rage O
which O
nothing O
but O
injustice O
, O
and O
the O
pitiful O
abuse O
of O
adventitious O
power O
can O
generate O
, O
he O
was O
not O
such O
a O
Quixote S-PERSON
as O
to O
hope O
that O
his O
arm O
could O
effectually O
redress O
the O
wrongs O
he O
witnessed O
, O
yet O
he O
thought O
with O
a O
sort O
of O
trembling O
exultation O
, O
that O
if O
, O
he O
had O
seized O
the O
craven O
overlooker O
, O
as O
he O
kicked O
from O
him O
the O
helpless O
object O
of O
his O
tyranny O
, O
he O
might O
have O
held O
him O
with O
a O
grasp O
that O
would O
have O
stopped O
his O
breath O
for O
ever O

It O
was O
a O
horrid O

a O
murderous O
thought O

poor O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
once O
the O
gentlest O

fondest O
little O
heart O
, O
that O
ever O
nestled O
to O
a O
mother's O
bosom O

did O
penance O
for O
it O
by O
a O
pang O
of O
self O

condemnation O

that O
made O
him O
grind O
his O
teeth O
in O
agony O

Yet O
even O
then O
the O
goaded O
spirit O
seemed O
to O
rise O
in O
rebellion O
against O
its O
own O
remorse O

turned O
his O
face O

fear O

God O

were O
always O
on O
the O
alert O
to O
reconnoitre O
that O
door O
, O
and O
never O
far O
distant O
from O
the O
commodious O
windows O
which O
gave O
them O
power O
to O
do O
so O
. O
Poor O
Sally S-PERSON
had O
found O
this O
but O
too O
surely O
in O
making O
her O
attempts O
, O
and O
Michael S-PERSON
had O
more O
than O
once O
listened O
to O
the O
merry O
tradition O
, O
which O
was O
a O
favourite O
story O
with O
the O
overlookers O
| | O
of O
how O
the O
silly O
girl O
had O
run O
in O
full O
sight O
of O
a O
dozen S-CARDINAL
watchful O
eyes O
, O
till O
her O
strength O
failed O
, O
and O
she O
sank O
down O
among O
the O
bushes O
and O
was O
taken O
, O
like O
a O
bird O
that O
having O
been O
long O
confined O
, O
has O
no O
strength O
of O
wing O
left O
to O
bear O
him O
beyond O
reach O
of O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
hand O
extended O
to O
recapture O
him O
. O
Yet O
this O
open O
postern O
was O
the O
only O
one O
by O
which O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
pass O
| | O
but O
the O
very O
extremity O
of O
the O
danger O
of O
passing O
it O
, O
made O
the O
attempt O
easy O
| | O
for O
though O
it O
was O
always O
carefully O
locked O
at O
night O
, O
and O
the O
key O
placed O
, O
together O
with O
those O
of O
every O
external O
door O
on O
the O
premises O
, O
under O
the O
pillow O
of O
Mr. O
Woodcomb S-PERSON
, O
the O
manager O
had O
more O
than O
once O
seen O
a O
miserable O
little O
head O
peeping O
through O
it O
when O
left O
open O
for O
the O
passage O
of O
the O
wheelbarrow O
, O
without O
testifying O
the O
least O
alarm O
. O
The O
time O
chosen O
by O
Michael S-PERSON
for O
passing O
this O
terrible O
door O
, O
was O
that O
during O
which O
the O
dirty O
herd O
were O
commanded O
to O
expose O
their O
faces O
and O
hands O
for O
a O
short O
moment O
to O
such O
cleansing O
as O
might O
be O
obtained O
in O
a O
huge O
trough O
, O
in O
company O
with O
a O
score O
or O
two S-CARDINAL
of O
competitors O
. O
It O
was O
constantly O
a O
moment O
of O
great O
noise O
, O
bustle O
, O
and O
hustling O
| | O
and O
it O
was O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
this O
that O
the O
young O
adventurer O
contrived O
, O
unobserved O
, O
to O
push O
back O
the O
only O
bolt O
which O
secured O
the O
door O
during O
the O
day O
, O
leaving O
it O
in O
a O
position O
to O
yield O
noiselessly O
to O
a O
very O
slight O
touch O
. O
At O
the O
sound O
of O
a O
bell O
, O
which O
rang O
about B-TIME
ten I-TIME
minutes E-TIME
after O
the O
children O
were O
turned O
out O
into O
the O
court O
to O
wash O
themselves O
, O
the O
whole O
troop O
hurried O
back O
again O
to O
the O
apprentice O
- O
house O
for O
their O
breakfast O
. O
It O
was O
then O
that O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
often O
the O
last O
to O
finish O
the O
too O
- O
short O
operation O
of O
washing O
, O
remained O
for O
a O
moment O
behind O
the O
rest O
, O
and O
in O
that O
moment O
, O
opening O
the O
door O
just O
wide O
enough O
for O
his O
slender O
figure O
to O
pass O
, O
he O
slipped O
through O
, O
and O
closed O
it O
after O
him O
. O
the O
fact O
was O
completely O
ascertained O
and O
known O
to O
nearly O
every O
inmate O
of O
the O
mill O
. O
Mr. O
Poulet's S-PERSON
second S-ORDINAL
wife O
, O
to O
whom O
he O
had O
then O
been O
married O
about B-DATE
three I-DATE
years E-DATE
, O
was O
in O
appearance O
the O
very O
reverse O
of O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
, O
being O
as O
remarkably O
small O
, O
as O
the O
other O
was O
large O
. O
But O
what O
she O
wanted O
in O
muscle O
, O
was O
made O
up O
in O
watchfulness O
. O
Nothing O
escaped O
her O
restless O
and O
malignant O
little O
eyes O
, O
and O
either O
from O
the O
incessant O
danger O
of O
her O
spying O
sharpness O
, O
or O
the O
propensity O
of O
the O
human O
mind O
to O
think O
present O
suffering O
worse O
than O
every O
other O
, O
there O
were O
many O
who O
declared O
they O
would O
be O
glad O
to O
have O
her O
brutal O
predecessor O
back O
again O
. O
It O
was O
this O
woman O
who O
first S-ORDINAL
descried O
the O
absence O
of O
Michael S-PERSON
from O
the O
board O
. O
" O
Hollo S-PERSON
! O
where O
is O
No. O
57 S-CARDINAL
? O
" O
she O
cried O
. O
No O
one O
could O
answer O
| | O
and O
No. O
57 S-CARDINAL
was O
sought O
for O
in O
vain O
from O
one S-CARDINAL
end O
of O
the O
premises O
to O
the O
other O
. O
" O
He O
is O
gone O
through O
the O
yard O
- O
door O
! O
" O
proclaimed O
the O
active O
and O
intelligent O
Mrs. O
Poulet S-PERSON
, O
after O
discovering O
that O
the O
bolt O
was O
withdrawn O
. O
" O
Off O
with O
you O
, O
you O
stupid O
old O
fool O
! O
" O
she O
added O
, O
addressing O
her O
husband O
| | O
" O
what O
d'ye O
stand O
staring O
there O
for O
? O
If O
you O
had O
the O
wit O
of O
a O
jackass O
, O
you O
might O
trace O
him O
by O
his O
feet O
on O
the O
dew O
— O
for O
there O
are O
the O
marks O
plain O
enough O
to O
any O
body O
, O
that O
has O
sense O
enough O
to O
look O
for O
' O
em O
. O
" O
And O
so O
in O
truth O
there O
were O
. O
A O
continuous O
track O
of O
footmarks O
, O
were O
easily O
traced O
from O
the O
door O
to O
the O
steep O
bank O
behind O
the O
factory O
, O
where O
they O
were O
lost O
in O
the O
covert O
of O
bushes O
, O
which O
had O
of O
late B-DATE
years E-DATE
been O
coaxed O
to O
clothe O
its O
sides O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
furnishing O
fagots O
. O
That O
some O
one O
had O
recently O
broken O
through O
these O
bushes O
was O
equally O
evident O
, O
from O
many O
boughs O
having O
been O
torn O
, O
and O
the O
soil O
beneath O
them O
trampled O
. O
This O
was O
enough O
to O
direct O
the O
pursuit O
, O
with O
so O
much O
certainty O
of O
being O
right O
, O
that O
Mr. O
Woodcomb S-PERSON
laughed O
as O
he O
gave O
the O
orders O
for O
it O
. O
" O
The O
bushes O
last O
for O
about B-QUANTITY
half I-QUANTITY
a I-QUANTITY
mile E-QUANTITY
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
" O
and O
then O
he O
must O
take O
over O
the O
hills O
, O
of O
course O
. O
Fine O
fellow O
, O
isn't O
he O
? O
It O
will O
be O
mighty O
hard O
to O
take O
him O
again O
, O
won't O
it O
? O
There's O
only O
three S-CARDINAL
justices O
of O
peace O
for O
him O
to O
be O
handed O
to O
, O
and O
only O
every O
man O
he O
meets O
ready O
to O
introduce O
him O
. O
The O
worst O
misfortune O
is O
, O
that O
I O
don't O
quite O
see O
where O
he O
is O
to O
get O
his O
dinner O
. O
" O
Two S-CARDINAL
stout O
overlookers O
started O
accordingly O
upon O
the O
track O
thus O
easily O
hit O
upon O
, O
and O
Mr. O
Woodcomb S-PERSON
awaited O
the O
result O
of O
their O
exertions O
without O
the O
slightest O
anxiety O
, O
or O
any O
irritation O
of O
nerves O
whatever O
| | O
albeit O
he O
knew O
that O
, O
favourite O
as O
he O
was O
, O
he O
might O
run O
no O
small O
risk O
of O
losing O
his O
place O
, O
should O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
apprentices O
really O
escape O
— O
but O
the O
thing O
was O
impossible O
| | O
no O
one O
could O
live O
without O
eating O
, O
not O
even O
one O
who O
had O
served O
his O
apprenticeship O
to O
starving O
as O
well O
as O
piecing O
at O
the B-FAC
Deep I-FAC

So O
Mr. O
Woodcomb S-PERSON
slept O
soundly O
, O
although O
in O
ignorance O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
Michael B-PERSON

BROTHERTON S-PERSON
, O
AND O
SPEEDILY O
PUT O
IN O
EXECUTION O
. O
It O
is O
now O
necessary O
that O
the O
narrative O
should O
briefly O
return O
to O
the O
period O
of O
Miss O
Brotherton's S-PERSON
arrival O
at O
Milford B-FAC
Park E-FAC
, O
after O
her O
unsuccessful O
expedition O
in O
pursuit O
of O
Michael S-PERSON
. O
There O
was O
no O
needless O
delay O
between O
this O
return O
to O
her O
home O
, O
and O
the O
communication O
to O
Mrs. O
Armstrong S-PERSON
and O
Edward S-PERSON
of O
the O
dismal O
news O
of O
which O
she O
was O
the O
bearer O

nor O
was O
there O
any O
consultation O
on O
this O
occasion O
, O
concerning O
the O
mode O
of O
her O
reaching O
Hoxley B-FAC
- I-FAC
lane E-FAC
. O
Poor O
Mary S-PERSON
had O
greatly O
advanced O
in O
independence O
of O
spirit O
within O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
few I-DATE
months E-DATE
| | O
and O
had O
she O
encountered O
all O
the O
military O
quartered O
within O
twenty B-QUANTITY
miles E-QUANTITY
, O
with O
the O
Dowling S-PERSON
family O
marching O
in O
procession O
at O
their O
head O
, O
she O
would O
have O
quietly O
driven O
through O
them O
all O
, O
with O
the O
carriage O
- O
windows O
up O
, O
perhaps O
, O
but O
with O
no O
greater O
precaution O
— O
except O
, O
indeed O
, O
an O
order O
to O
the O
coachman O
to O
drive O
on O
without O
stopping O
, O
let O
them O
meet O
who O
they O
would O
. O
The O
carriage O
was O
at O
the O
door O
the O
morning O
after O
their O
return O
, O
and O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
had O
not O
yet O
named O
her O
intended O
expedition O
to O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
. O
" O
You O
are O
going O
out O
without O
me O
, O
my O
dear O
? O
" O
said O
the O
old O
lady O
on O
hearing O
it O
announced O

" O
I O
am O
going O
to O
the O
widow O
Armstrong's S-PERSON
, O
dear O
nurse O

replied O
the O
heiress O
. O
" O
Your O
presence O
cannot O
help O
me O
through O
this O
dreaded O
visit O

why O
should O
I O
make O
you O
share O
the O
pain O
of O
it O
? O
" O
" O
Why O
? O
my O
dear O
! O
because O
I O
am O
of O
no O
earthly O
use O
, O
and O
had O
better O
die O
at O
once O
if O
I O
cannot O
be O
of O
some O
little O
comfort O
to O
you O
at O
such O
a O
time O
as O
this O

Why O
, O
don't O
I O
know O
all O
about O
it O

how O
you O
must O
feel O
at O
this O
very O
moment O

just O
as O
well O
as O
you O
do O
yourself O

Mary S-PERSON
? O
Sure O
it O
was O
a O
foolish O
notion O
to O
leave O
me O
here O
enjoying O
the O
arm O

chair O
and O
the O
foot O
- O
stool O
, O
and O
the O
flowers O
, O
while O
you O
are O
having O
your O
heart O
broken O
by O
telling O
that O
poor O
pale O
body O

that O
the O
child O
she O
loved O
so O
dearly O

dead O

gone O

ever O

" O
If O
you O

save O
either O
her O

me O
a O
pang O
, O
nurse O
Tremlett S-PERSON
, O
I O
would O
not O
thus O
have O
spared O
you O

Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON

" O
However O
, O
you O
shall O
go O
with O
me O

yourself O

quiet O

poor O
Fanny S-PERSON

I O

Martin S-PERSON

assisting O
in O
arranging O
the O
little O

all O
over O

of O

Mrs. O

Mary S-PERSON
? O
" O
" O
It O
will O
, O
indeed O
, O
dear O
nurse O
! O
You O
are O
very O
right O
, O
and O
very O
wise O
in O
this O
. O
She O
shall O
go O
with O
us O
, O
poor O
child O
. O
Though O
it O
will O
be O
a O
dreadful O
task O
for O
her O
! O
" O
replied O
Mary S-PERSON
. O
" O
And O
you O
would O
rather O
take O
it O
, O
dear O
, O
all O
on O
your O
own O
shoulders O
? O
I O
do O
not O
doubt O
that O
— O
only O
you O
don't O
know O
how O
to O
manage O
it O
, O
" O
replied O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
. O
" O
But O
there O
is O
another O
thing O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
that O
I O
have O
been O
thinking O
of O
, O
" O
continued O
the O
kind O
- O
hearted O
old O
woman O
, O
" O
and O
that O
is O
the O
other O
poor O
boy O
. O
I'll O
engage O
to O
say O
, O
he O
has O
never O
missed O
school O
for O
an B-TIME
hour E-TIME
, O
after O
what O
you O
said O
to O
him O
about O
exerting O
himself O
. O
I O
saw O
how O
he O
took O
it O
| | O
and O
, O
therefore O
, O
you O
may O
depend O
upon O
it O
, O
that O
he O
is O
at O
the O
schoolhouse O
now O
. O
Then O
just O
think O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
what O
his O
going O
home O
will O
be O
after O
you O
have O
told O
all O
! O
Poor O
creatures O
! O
It O
makes O
one's O
heart O
sick O
to O
fancy O
it O
! O
If O
I O
were O
you O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
I O
would O
send O
for O
him O
, O
tell O
him O
every O
thing O
at O
once O
, O
and O
then O
take O
him O
home O
to O
his O
mother O
. O
" O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
instantly O
rose O
and O
rang O
the O
bell O
. O
" O
Do O
not O
say O
you O
are O
of O
no O
use O
, O
my O
dear O
good O
creature O
! O
" O
said O
she O
. O
" O
How O
infinitely O
better O
this O
will O
be O
than O
the O
hurried O
, O
thoughtless O
plan O
which O
I O
had O
sketched O
! O
" O
A O
message O
was O
accordingly O
despatched O
to O
the O
schoolhouse O
to O
summon O
Edward B-PERSON
Armstrong E-PERSON
, O
and O
in O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes E-TIME
he O
stood O
before O
them O
. O
Most O
true O
is O
it O
that O
there O
is O
something O
holy O
and O
imposing O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
sorrow O
. O
It O
would O
be O
difficult O
to O
imagine O
any O
entrée O
into O
the O
boudoir O
of O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
, O
which O
would O
have O
inspired O
a O
feeling O
both O
in O
her O
and O
her O
friend O
so O
nearly O
approaching O
awe O
, O
as O
did O
that O
of O
Edward B-PERSON
Armstrong E-PERSON
. O
" O
There O
is O
no O
need O
to O
tell O
him O
, O
poor O
fellow O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
, O
mournfully O
shaking O
her O
head O
, O
as O
she O
saw O
the O
sudden O
and O
eloquent O
change O
in O
Edward's S-PERSON
countenance O
the O
moment O
he O
looked O
in O
the O
face O
of O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
. O
" O
There O
is O
no O
need O
to O
tell O
him O
! O
He O
knows O
it O
all O
, O
already O
! O
" O
" O
He O
is O
dead O
, O
then O
! O
" O
said O
the O
boy O
, O
his O
pale O
lips O
parting O
, O
as O
it O
seemed O
, O
with O
difficulty O
, O
to O
pronounce O
the O
words O
, O
" O
Please O
, O
ma'am O
, O
let O
me O
go O
away O
. O
" O
He O
looked O
as O
if O
he O
were O
unable O
to O
sustain O
himself O
| | O
and O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
really O
fearing O
he O
might O
fall O
, O
started O
from O
her O
seat O
, O
and O
throwing O
her O
arms O
round O
him O
, O
almost O
carried O
him O
to O
the O
sofa O
. O
" O
No O
, O
no O
, O
my O
poor O
Edward S-PERSON
! O
" O
she O
said O
, O
" O
do O
not O
go O
away O
. O
Stay O
with O
those O
who O
love O
and O
pity O
you O
! O
Poor O
Michael S-PERSON
is O
dead O
, O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
and O
we O
must O
all O
try O
to O
support O
your O
mother O
under O
the O
dreadful O
news O
. O
" O
" O
How O
do O
you O
know O
he O
is O
dead O
? O
" O
cried O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
starting O
up O
, O
and O
looking O
almost O
sternly O
at O
his O
benefactress O
. O
" O
How O
do O
you O
know O
that O
they O
have O
not O
hid O
him O
away O
where O
you O
cannot O
find O
him O
, O
that O
they O
may O
torture O
him O
, O
and O
work O
him O
to O
the O
bone O
, O
when O
there O
is O
nobody O
by O
to O
see O
? O
" O
" O
I O
know O
that O
he O
is O
dead O

too O
well O
, O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
" O
replied O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
gently O
. O
" O
I O
have O
brought O
home O
with O
me O
a O
little O
girl O
who O
worked O
in O
the O
same O
factory O
, O
and O
who O
knew O
him O
well O
. O
He O
died O
of O
an O
infectious O
fever O
that O
killed O
many O
, O
many O
more O
. O
I O
am O
going O
to O
take O
this O
little O
girl O
with O
me O
to O
your O
mother O
, O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
that O
she O
may O
question O
her O
, O
if O
she O
wishes O
it O
, O
about O
poor O
Michael S-PERSON

I O
wish O
you O
to O
go O
with O
us O

my O
dear O
boy O

better O

you O

" O
" O
You O
are O

tell O
mother O

the O
boy O
with O
a O
shudder O
. O
" O
Yes O
, O
Edward S-PERSON
! O
— O
It O
must O
be O
done O
, O
and O
the O
sooner O
it O
is O
over O
the O
better O
. O
Your O
mother O
is O
a O
good O
woman O
, O
and O
a O
pious O
Christian S-NORP
, O
my O
dear O
boy O
. O
She O
will O
know O
and O
feel O
that O
all O
that O
can O
befall O
her O
is O
the O
will O
of O
God O

and O
when O
she O
remembers O
this O
, O
she O
will O
rise O
above O
her O
sorrow O
, O
and O
thinking O
of O
the O
better O
world O
hereafter O
, O
will O
be O
able O

will O

ma'am O
— O
if O
it O
does O
not O
kill O
her O
first S-ORDINAL
, O
" O
answered O
Edward S-PERSON
. O
" O
Indeed O
, O
I O
think O
a O
great O
deal O
will O
depend O
on O
you O
, O
dear O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
as O
to O
her O
manner O
of O
bearing O
it O

If O
she O
sees O
you O
sink O
, O
be O
sure O
she O
will O
sink O
too O

if O
you O
make O
her O

has O
still O
a O
beloved O
child O
to O
live O
for O
, O
to O
whom O
life O
may O
yet O
be O
a O
blessing O
, O
she O
will O
cease O
to O
repine O
for O
the O
loss O
of O
one S-CARDINAL
child O
, O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
making O
the O
other O
happy O

" O
Edward S-PERSON
slowly O
and O
silently O
shook O
his O
head O

but O
after O
the O
melancholy O
silence O
of O
a B-TIME
minute E-TIME
or O
two S-CARDINAL
, O
he O
said O

The O
scene O
which O
followed O
beside O
the O
bed O
of O
the O
poor O
widow O
, O
was O
one O
of O
such O
deep O
, O
but O
patient O
sorrow O
, O
as O
left O
an O
impression O
never O

on O
the O
minds O
of O
those O
who O
witnessed O
it O

Mary's S-ORG
counsel O
had O
not O
been O
thrown O
away O
upon O
Edward S-PERSON

The O
boy O
displayed O
both O
a O
delicacy O
and O
firmness O
of O
character O
beyond O
his O
years O
, O
and O
above O
his O
education O

No O
ordinary O
topics O
of O
consolation O
were O
clumsily O
uttered O
to O
redeem O
his O
pledge O
to O
Mary S-PERSON

nor O
did O
he O
affect O
a O
stoical O
indifference O
which O
he O
could O
not O
feel O

with O
gentle O
endearments O
he O
drew O
the O
mourning O
mother O
to O
think O
of O
him O
, O
and O
there O
was O
healing O
, O
as O
well O
as O
agony O
, O
in O
the O
tears O
she O
shed O
upon O
his O
bosom O

Of O
all O
this O
Fanny S-PERSON
was O
a O
silent O

deeply O
- O
moved O

The O
widow O
gave O
her O
one S-CARDINAL
earnest O
look O
when O
Mary S-PERSON
said O
, O
" O

little O

One S-CARDINAL
long O

upon O

pressing O
the O
hand O

Mrs. O

murmured O
in O
her O

" O

Mary S-PERSON
nodded O

place O
in O

a O
specimen O
of O
female O
tenderness O

pity O

this O
lovely O
little O
girl O
exhibited O

ministering O
to O
the O
poor O
crippled O
woman O
, O
whose O
only O
claim O
upon O
her O
love O
was O
, O
that O
she O
wanted O
it O

a O
species O
of O
claim O

Martha S-PERSON
, O
it O
was O
a O
heavy O

Most O
miserable O

indeed O

the B-DATE

from O
the O
day O
of O
her O
painful O
, O
but O
useless O
visit O
to O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
, O
her O
eyes O
had O
been O
, O
in O
a O
great O
degree O
, O
opened O
to O
the O
hard O
and O
avaricious O
nature O
of O
her O
father's O
character O
. O
Like O
a O
person O
excluded O
from O
the O
light O
of O
the O
sun O
, O
and O
seeing O
only O
by O
the O
delusive O
glare O
of O
an O
unsteady O
lamp O
, O
Martha S-PERSON
had O
passed O
her O
whole O
life O
in O
mistaking O
the O
nature O
and O
the O
value O
of O
almost O
every O
object O
around O
her O
. O
The O
language O
of O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton E-PERSON
had O
shot O
with O
a O
painful O
and O
unwelcome O
brightness O
upon O
the O
dim O
and O
uncertain O
twilight O
of O
her O
moral O
perceptions O
| | O
and O
the O
unhappy O
girl O
learned O
to O
know O
that O
the O
only O
being O
who O
had O
ever O
seemed O
to O
love O
her O
, O
or O
whom O
she O
had O
ever O
ventured O
to O
love O
, O
was O
one O
that O
her O
better O
reason O
shrunk O
from O
, O
and O
her O
sober O
judgment O
condemned O
. O
to O
watch O
some O
favourable O
moment O
, O
she O
might O
have O
the O
surpassing O
joy O
of O
seeing O
his O
heart O
open O
to O
the O
truth O
, O
and O
in O
a O
state O
to O
permit O
her O
helping O
to O
lead O
him O
to O
efficient O
repentance O
, O
and O
the O
all O
- O
merciful O
forgiveness O
of O
God O
. O
It O
was O
impossible O
but O
that O
such O
thoughts O
and O
feelings O
must O
separate O
her O
, O
more O
than O
ever O
, O
from O
the O
rest O
of O
her O
family O
, O
and O
she O
had O
already O
pretty O
generally O
received O
the O
epithet O
of O
methodistical O
, O
from O
the O
whole O
neighbourhood O
| | O
but O
she O
hailed O
it O
as O
a O
blessing O
, O
and O
without O
a O
shadow O
of O
religious O
enthusiasm O
, O
beyond O
what O
was O
almost O
inevitable O
under O
the O
circumstances O
, O
and O
with O
no O
sectarian O
views O
or O
notions O
whatever O
, O
poor O
Martha S-PERSON
gladly O
sheltered O
herself O
under O
the O
imputation O
of O
both O
in O
order O
to O
avoid O
joining O
in O
scenes O
of O
amusement O
for O
which O
she O
had O
no O
relish O
. O
In O
such O
a O
state O
of O
mind O
it O
was O
natural O
enough O
that O
Martha S-PERSON
should O
deem O
a O
visit O
to O
the O
bereaved O
mother O
a O
penance O
which O
it O
was O
her O
duty O
to O
perform O
( O
though O
it O
was O
more O
painful O
to O
her O
, O
perhaps O
, O
than O
almost O
any O
other O
to O
which O
she O
could O
have O
been O
subjected O
) O
, O
and O
she O
did O
perform O
it O
accordingly O
. O
She O
found O
the O
poor O
sufferer O
, O
whose O
eye O
she O
dreaded O
to O
meet O
, O
sinking O
fast O
into O
peace O
and O
rest O
, O
that O
never O
more O
could O
be O
disturbed O
. O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON

Fanny S-PERSON
were O
both O
with O
her O

a O
bible O

in O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
former O

Mrs. O
Armstrong's S-PERSON
countenance O
, O
though O
greatly O
more O
pinched O
and O
pallid O
than O
she O
had O
ever O
before O
seen O
it O
, O
expressed O
a O
tranquil O
calmness O
which O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
contemplate O
without O
pleasure O
. O
But O
, O
alas O
! O
for O
poor O
Martha S-PERSON
! O
she O
had O
the O
pang O
of O
seeing O
this O
consoled O
and O
consoling O
look O
suddenly O
changed O
to O
an O
expression O
of O
intense O
suffering O
, O
the O
moment O
her O
own O
person O
met O
the O
poor O
woman's O
eye O
. O
They O
had O
never O
seen O
each O
other O
since O
the O
fatal O
morning O
on O
which O
Martha S-PERSON
had O
so O
innocently O
persuaded O
her O
to O
sign O
the O
articles O
of O
her O
boy's O
apprenticeship O
, O
and O
the O
recollection O
of O
that O
scene O
, O
and O
all O
its O
consequences O
, O
could O
not O
so O
suddenly O
come O
upon O
one O
, O
reduced O
already O
to O
almost O
the O
last O
stage O
of O
weakness O
, O
without O
shaking O
her O
terribly O
. O
The O
distended O
eye O
, O
the O
open O
mouth O
, O
the O
heaving O
breast O
, O
all O
spoke O
a O
degree O
of O
agitation O
, O
which O
in O
her O
condition O
was O
frightfully O
alarming O
| | O
and O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
who O
dreaded O
lest O
the O
calmness O
of O
her O
last O
moments O
should O
be O
disturbed O
, O
hastily O
turned O
to O
the O
intruder O
, O
and O
said O
, O
" O
Go O
, O
go O
! O
— O
the O
sight O
of O
you O
will O
kill O
her O
! O
" O
Though O
there O
was O
no O
more O
of O
harshness O
in O
this O
, O
than O
the O
urgent O
circumstances O
of O
the O
case O
seemed O
to O
call O
for O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton E-PERSON
would O
have O
rather O
died O
than O
utter O
it O
, O
could O
she O
have O
guessed O
the O
pang O
it O
gave O
to O
the O
already O
wounded O
heart O
of O
poor O
Martha S-PERSON
. O
She O
made O
no O
reply O

but O
, O
fixing O
on O
the O
victim O
of O
her O
most O
innocent O
delusion O
, O
a O
look O
, O
just O
long O
enough O
to O
impress O
the O
terrible O
expression O
of O
her O
countenance O
upon O
her O
own O
heart O
for O
ever O
, O
she O
turned O
away O
, O
and O
reached O
her O
splendid O
home O
in O
a O
state O
of O
mind O
that O
seemed O
fearfully O
to O
verify O
the O
annunciation O
, O
" O
He O
will O
visit O
the O
sins O
of O
the O
fathers O
upon O
the O
children O

" O
her O
death O
, O
and O
the O
time O
of O
it O
, O
with O
sufficient O
accuracy O
to O
leave O
no O
doubt O
on O
Martha's S-PERSON
mind O
, O
that O
the O
event O
had O
been O
accelerated O
by O
her O
appearance O

Happily O
, O
however O
, O
for O
those O
who O
tenderly O
watched O
her O
last O
moments O
, O
the O
widow O
Armstrong's S-PERSON
gentle O
nature O
permitted O
her O
not O
long O
to O
suffer O
from O
the O
irritation O
which O
the O
presence O
of O
Martha S-PERSON
produced O
, O
and O
many O
hours O
before O
she O
closed O
her O
eyes O
for O
ever O
, O
she O
expressed O
her O
sorrow O
for O
having O
yielded O
so O
weakly O
to O
feelings O
which O
she O
had O
hoped O
were O
altogether O
conquered O
| | O
assuring O
Mary S-PERSON
( O
who O
never O
left O
her O
) O
that O
she O
acquitted O
the O
young O
lady O
of O
all O
intention O
to O
deceive O
her O
, O
and O
that O
the O
shock O
she O
felt O
from O
seeing O
her O
, O
only O
proceeded O
from O
the O
vivid O
recollections O
her O
appearance O
awakened O
. O
Unhappily O
, O
however O
, O
it O
was O
long O
ere O
this O
healing O
assurance O
reached O
poor O
Martha S-PERSON

for O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
far O
from O
guessing O
its O
importance O
to O
her O
, O
had O
decided O
upon O
having O
no O
further O
intercourse O
with O
the O
Dowling S-PERSON
family O
: O
a O
resolution O
which O
would O
never O
have O
been O
taken O
had O
her O
last O
interview O
with O
Martha S-PERSON
at O
Milford B-FAC
Park E-FAC
ended O
more O
pleasantly O
. O
But O
it O
had O
been O
already O
so O
long O
acted O
upon O
, O
that O
it O
would O
have O
been O
equally O
awkward O
and O
disagreeable O
to O
break O
through O
it O
| | O
and O
Martha S-PERSON
long O
continued O
in O
the O
terrible O
persuasion O
that O
she O
had O
been O
accessory O
to O
the O
death O
of O
both O
mother O
and O
son O
. O
neighbourhood O
, O
and O
for O
several B-DATE
months E-DATE
after O
her O
return O
she O
contented O
herself O
with O
following O
Mr. O
Bell's S-PERSON
prescriptions O
, O
for O
friction O
and O
moderate O
exercise O
, O
without O
calling O
in O
any O

all O

But O
though O
the O
improvement O
that O
followed O
was O
very O
perceptible O
, O
it O
was O
not O
rapid O
, O
and O
the O
idea O
of O
London S-GPE
advice O
suggested O
itself O
, O
as O
the O
most O
satisfactory O
mode O
of O
ascertaining O
at O
once O
whether O
a O
perfect O
recovery O
might O
be O
hoped O
for O

information O
which O
it O
was O
very O
desirable O
she O
should O
obtain O
, O
before O
she O
decided O
in O
what O
way O
she O
should O
bring O
him O
up O
. O
Since O
the O
death O
of O
his O
mother O

Milford B-FAC

been O
Edward's S-PERSON

orphan O

by O
far O
the O
more O
important O
portion O
of O
his O

went O
on O
under O
her O

, O
as O
well O
as O
that O
of O
his O
little O
companion O

was O
beginning O
to O
take O
a O
form O

extent O
totally O
different O
from O

had O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
intended O
for O
either O
of O
them O

Ideas O
respecting O
them O
both O
, O
began O
by O
degrees O
to O
arise O
in O
her O
mind O
, O
which O
she O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
endeavoured O
to O
resist O
, O
as O
being O
too O
much O
out O
of O
the O
usual O
course O
to O
be O
safely O
indulged O
in O

" O

a O
woman O
of O
fortune O
of O

which O
once O

again O
she O
had O
rejected O
, O
as O
too O
romantic O

absurd O
, O
gradually O
grew O
into O
an O
habitual O
theme O
of O
meditation O
on O
which O
her O
fancy O
delighted O
to O
fix O
itself O

age O

whatever O

brought O
herself O
to O
think O

most O

would O
very O
naturally O
have O
deemed O
her O
adopting O
a O
boy O
of O
twelve S-CARDINAL

a O
girl O
of O
eleven S-CARDINAL

a O
most O
outrageously O
preposterous O

imprudent O
act O

But O
her O
situation O
was O
one O
in O
most O
respects O
quite O
out O
of O
the O
common O
way O

she O
every O

felt O
it O
more O

took O
place O
upon O
the O
case O
of O
Edward S-PERSON

, O
perhaps O
, O
the O
greatest O
pleasure O
Mary S-PERSON
had O
ever O
known O

for O
the O
sentence O

pronounced O
was O

that O

were O
in O
a O
state O

progress O

the O
weakness O

distortion O
brought O
on O
by O

not O

lasted O
long O

That O
any O
such O
should O
arise O
to O
disappoint O
her O
hopes O
was O
not O
likely O

all O
that O

As O
to O
her O
question O
respecting O
German S-NORP
baths O
, O
the O
answer O
was O
less O
unanimous O

two S-CARDINAL
gentlemen O
being O
of O
opinion O
that O
they O
would O
do O
no O
good O
at O
all O

two S-CARDINAL
that O
it O
was O
doubtful O
whether O
the O
case O
would O
be O
affected O
by O
them O

not O

and O
one O
that O
great O
benefit O
might O
probably O
ensue O
. O
But O
as O
all O
were O
of O
opinion O
that O
change O
of O

was O
desirable O

as O
a O
pretty O

fresh O
fields O

this O
judgment O

Miss O

the O

not O

the O

Nothing O

this O

of O
an O
apprentice O
at O
the B-FAC

It O
would O
be O
difficult O
to O
imagine O
a O
stronger O
contrast O
in O
the O
situation O
of O
two S-CARDINAL

that O
which O
many O

years O
presented O
between O

Edward S-PERSON

Edward S-PERSON

enjoying O
all O
that O
nature O

fortune O
could O
give O

while O
Michael S-PERSON
still O
hopelessly O
dragged O
on O
a O
wretched O
existence O
amidst O
unceasing O
and O
unvarying O
suffering O
! O
At O
length O
the O
desperate O
resolution O
was O
formed O
which O
put O
the O
officials O
of O
the O
Deep B-LOC
Valley E-LOC
factory O
in O
the O
state O
of O
activity O
already O
described O
. O
And O
where O
was O
Michael S-PERSON
the O
while O
? O
Safely O
ensconced O
in O
a O
sort O
of O
rude O
drain O
, O
which O
he O
had O
himself O
assisted O
to O
construct O
, O
when O
he O
held O
the O
regretted O
office O
of O
scavenger O
of O
the O
court O
, O
and O
over O
the O
aperture O
of O
which O
he O
easily O
arranged O
sticks O
and O
rubbish O
sufficient O
to O
conceal O
him O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
lay O
for O
many B-TIME
hours E-TIME
listening O
to O
the O
hubbub O
which O
his O
absence O
occasioned O
. O
He O
distinctly O
heard O
the O
expression O
of O
Mrs. O
Poulet's S-PERSON
anger O
and O
scorn O
, O
as O
messenger O
after O
messenger O
returned O
, O
without O
bringing O
tidings O
of O
him O

and O
had O
, O
moreover O
, O
the O
advantage O
of O
knowing O
the O
track O
that O
he O
had O
purposely O
made O
on O
the O
grass O
which O
grew O
tall O
and O
rank O
immediately O
behind O
the O
factory O
, O
had O
led O
them O
, O
and O
would O
continue O
to O
lead O
them O
, O
all O
one S-CARDINAL
way O
, O
while O
he O
would O
of O
course O
take O
especial O
care O
to O
go O
another O
. O
Having O
left O
his O
foot O
- O
marks O
on O
the O
grass O
in O
the O
manner O
described O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
had O
scrambled O
through O
the O
bushes O
which O
covered O
the O
steep O
hill O
- O
side O
, O
for O
the O
distance O
of O
a B-QUANTITY
few I-QUANTITY
hundred I-QUANTITY
yards E-QUANTITY
, O
and O
then O
, O
taking O
advantage O
of O
a O
layer O
of O
stones O
, O
by O
which O
a O
patch O
of O
marshy O
ground O
had O
been O
rendered O
firm O
, O
he O
again O
crossed O
from O
the O
hill O
towards O
the O
factory O
, O
without O
leaving O
any O
trace O
behind O
. O
By O
this O
simple O
device O
his O
pursuers O
were O
completely O
thrown O
out O
, O
for O
when O
night O
came O
and O
he O
crawled O
out O
from O
his O
shelter O
, O
no O
eye O
was O
open O
to O
look O
for O
him O
close O
to O
his O
prison O

walls O
, O
though O
very O
keen O
ones O
were O
busy O
elsewhere O
in O
search O
of O
him O
. O
sleep O
, O
and O
with O
every O
pulse O
throbbing O
between O
hope O
and O
fear O
, O
he O
strode O
rapidly O
onward O
on O
the O
road O
he O
had O
come O
with O
Parsons S-PERSON
four B-DATE
years I-DATE
before E-DATE
, O
carefully O
avoiding O
its O
grassy O
margin O
, O
however O
, O
lest O
more O
footsteps O
might O
be O
traced O
. O
Then O
, O
revolving O
with O
great O
clearness O
of O
local O
recollection O
, O
the O
direction O
in O
which O
this O
road O
led O
, O
after O
mounting O
the O
hill O
, O
he O
firmly O
resolved O
, O
as O
long O
as O
his O
strength O
lasted O
, O
to O
pursue O
it O
, O
till O
it O
brought O
him O
to O
the O
door O
of O
his O
mother's O
home O
— O
provided O
always O
, O
that O
he O
was O
not O
stopped O
short O
by O
the O
grasp O
of O
an O
overlooker O
in O
the O
way O
. O
The O
necessity O
of O
procuring O
food O
had O
not O
appeared O
to O
him O
any O
obstacle O
to O
the O
undertaking O

for O
not O
only O
had O
he O
great O
faith O
in O
his O
own O
power O
of O
enduring O
abstinence O
, O
but O
he O
had O
faith O
too O
, O
in O
the O
impossibility O
of O
begging O
at O
a O
firm O
- O
house O
door O
for O
a O
morsel O
of O
bread O
, O
in O
vain O
— O
nor O
did O
either O
hope O
deceive O
him O
: O
he O
walked O
till O
nightfall O
with O
no O
other O
refreshment O
than O
water O
, O
caught O
in O
the O
hollow O
of O
his O
hand O
from O
a O
trickling O
road O
- O
side O
spring O
, O
and O
a O
few O
blackberries O
, O
snatched O
in O
terror O
, O
as O
he O
hurried O
on O
. O
As O
the O
darkness O
thickened O
round O
him O
, O
he O
called O
a O
counsel O
with O
himself O
, O
as O
to O
whether O
it O
would O
be O
wisest O
to O
lay O
down O
under O
the O
shelter O
of O
a O
hay O
- O
rick O
, O
and O
let O
sleep O
serve O
him O
for O
supper O
, O
or O
to O
venture O
a O
petition O
for O
a O
morsel O
of O
food O
at O
a O
decent O
- O
looking O
mansion O
which O
he O
saw O
at O
some O
distance O
, O
and O
walk O
on O
through O
the O
night O
, O
if O
he O
succeeded O
, O
by O
help O
of O
the O
strength O
so O
recruited O
. O
After O
many O
anxious O
reasonings O
, O
pro O
and O
con O
, O
he O
at O
last O
decided O
upon O
the O
latter O
, O
and O
so O
well O
did O
his O
handsome O
face O
and O
simple O
assurance O
that O
he O
was O
very O
hungry O
, O
plead O
for O
him O
, O
that O
he O
not O
only O
obtained O
scraps O
sufficient O
for O
a O
hearty O
supper O
, O
but O
a O
crust O
or O
two S-CARDINAL
for O
the O
following O
morning O

and O
with O
this O
treasure O
he O
trudged O
on O
, O
footsore O
indeed O
, O
and O
with O
a O
pretty O
strong O
inclination O
to O
lie O
down O
and O
sleep O
, O
but O
mental O
energy O
sufficed O
for O
many O
hours O
to O
conquer O
bodily O
fatigue O
, O
and O
it O
was O
not O
till O
past O
three B-TIME

the B-TIME
next I-TIME
morning E-TIME
, O
that O
he O
yielded O

at O
last O
laid O
himself O
down O
in O
a O
dry O
, O
and O
, O
as O
he O
thought O
it O
, O
most O
delightfully O
comfortable O
ditch O
, O
and O
slept O
the O
sleep O
of O
youth O
and O
weariness O
for O
three B-TIME
four I-TIME
hours E-TIME

The O
bright O
beams O
of O
an O
autumn O
sun O
shooting O
directly O
upon O
his O
eyes O
awakened O
him O

he O
started O
up O
, O
ready O
and O
able O
to O
walk O
forward O
, O
sufficiently O
thankful O
for O
the O
hoarded O
crusts O
in O
his O
pocket O
. O
commending O
himself O
to O
God O
, O
he O
set O
off O
at O
the O
fleetest O
pace O
he O
could O
achieve O
, O
towards O
Ashleigh S-PERSON
. O
No O
symptom O
of O
pursuit O

alarmed O
him O

From O
the O
moment O

quitted O
the O
mills O

to O
that O

had O
once O
been O
his O
mother's O
door O
, O
no O
terror O
of O
the O
kind O
had O
come O
near O
him O

had O
heard O

distance O
. O
All O
he O
had O
most O
feared O
was O
got O
through O
with O
ease O
| | O
but O
all O
he O
had O
most O
fondly O
hoped O
, O
turned O
out O
a O
fearful O
blank O
. O
As O
Michael S-PERSON
drew O
near O
the O
door O
, O
he O
remembered O
so O
well O
every O
object O
which O
met O
his O
eye O
, O
that O
he O
began O
to O
fear O
lest O
he O
himself O
might O
be O
remembered O
by O
others O
, O
and O
making O
a O
circuit O
to O
avoid O
Sir O
Matthew's S-PERSON
mills O
, O
he O
reached O
Hoxley B-FAC
- I-FAC
lane E-FAC
without O
having O
met O
a O
single O
face O
he O
knew O
. O
It O
was O
a O
tremendous O
moment O
for O
him O
, O
that O
in O
which O
he O
first S-ORDINAL
caught O
sight O
of O
the O
lowly O
door O
through O
which O
he O
had O
passed O
a B-CARDINAL
thousand E-CARDINAL
times O
in O
eager O
anticipation O
of O
his O
mother's O
kiss O
! O
Some B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
followed O
before O
he O
could O
reach O
it O
, O
and O
the O
boy O
trembled O
so O
violently O
that O
he O
tottered O
as O
he O
hurried O
onward O
, O
like O
a O
drunken O
man O
. O
At O
length O
his O
hand O
was O
on O
the O
latch O
| | O
it O
yielded O
as O
in O
days O
of O
yore O
, O
and O
in O
an O
instant O
the O
door O
was O
wide O
open O
before O
him O
. O
Poor O
Michael S-PERSON
! O
what O
death O
can O
have O
a O
pang O
so O
bitter O
as O
that O
he O
felt O
, O
when O
the O
almost O
impossible O
project O
of O
reaching O
his O
mother's O
home O
being O
performed O
, O
he O
found O
that O
home O
empty O
and O
desolate O
, O
and O
telling O
him O
as O
plainly O
as O
angels O
trumpet O
- O
tongued O
could O
do O
, O
that O
she O
was O
dead O
! O
A O
dismal O
groan O
burst O
from O
him O
, O
and O
he O
sunk O
on O
the O
floor O
, O
just O
where O
he O
had O
last O
stood O
gaily O
talking O
to O
her O
of O
his O
bright O
fancies O
for O
the O
future O
, O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
hours E-TIME
before O
he O
was O
snatched O
away O
from O
her O
for O
ever O
. O
The O
noise O
he O
made O
reached O
the O
ears O
of O
a O
woman O
in O
the O
front O
room O
, O
and O
she O
opened O
the O
door O
of O
communication O
to O
ascertain O
who O
it O
could O
be O
, O
rummaging O
in O
the O
empty O
room O
that O
was O
" O
to O
let O
. O
" O
" O
My O
gracious O
! O
I O
should O
like O
to O
know O
who O
you O
are O
? O
What O
do O
you O
want O
here O
, O
you O
ragamuffin O

Is O
this O
the O
way O
you O
come O
to O
take O
lodgings O
, O
pray O
? O
" O
This O
was O
said O
by O
a O
young O
and O
pretty O
woman O
who O
held O
a O
baby O
in O
her O
arms O
, O
and O
who O
being O
the O
wife O
of O
a O
confidential O
overlooker O
, O
had O
not O
only O
succeeded O
to O
the O
occupation O
of O
No. O
12 S-CARDINAL
, O
upon O
the O
death O
of O
Mrs. O
Sykes S-PERSON
and O
the O
dispersion O
of O
her O
family O
| | O
but O
considered O
herself O
privileged O
to O
assume O
, O
on O
most O
occasions O
, O
an O
air O
of O
great O
importance O
. O
" O
Mother O
lived O
here O
! O
" O
said O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
look O
wretched O
enough O
to O
soften O
the O
heart O
of O
the O
saucy O
girl O
who O
had O
addressed O
him O
. O
" O
Your O
mother O
, O
my O
poor O
boy O
? O
Are O
you O
the O
little O
orphan O
Armstrong S-PERSON
, O
then O
? O
" O
was O
the O
reply O
. O
" O
Is O
mother O
dead O
? O
" O
said O
the O
unhappy O
boy O
. O
" O
Dead O

be O
sure O

sobbed O
Michael S-PERSON

" O
I O
came O
here O
to O
find O
her O

" O
" O
Poor O
fellow O
! O
that's O
dismal O
enough O
to O
be O
sure O
. O
I O
bean't O
Ashleigh S-PERSON
born O
, O
but O
I O
have O
heard O
a O
deal O
since O
I O
comed O
here O
, O
about O
the O
widow O
Armstrong S-PERSON
and O
the O
boy O
as O
died O
! O
" O
" O
Died O
! O
" O
echoed O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
looking O
wildly O
at O
her O
. O
" O
Is O
he O
dead O
too O
? O
Is O
my O
poor O
Teddy S-PERSON
dead O
? O
" O
" O
Sure O
- O
ly O
he O
is O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
unthinking O
young O
woman O
, O
who O
, O
in O
truth O
, O
knew O
nothing O
about O
either O
the O
widow O
Armstrong S-PERSON
or O
her O
son O
, O
but O
remembered O
hearing O
that O
a B-DATE
little I-DATE
more I-DATE
than I-DATE
a I-DATE
year E-DATE
before O
she O
took O
possession O
of O
the O
premises O
, O
a O
widow O
Armstrong S-PERSON
had O
died O
in O
the O
back O
room O
, O
for O
grief O
at O
having O
lost O
a O
boy O
. O
She O
was O
far O
from O
intending O
to O
be O
cruel O
to O
the O
poor O
lad O
, O
who O
looked O
himself O
so O
very O
nearly O
like O
a O
corpse O
, O
but O
was O
too O
indifferent O
upon O
all O
subjects O
which O
did O
not O
immediately O
concern O
herself O
, O
to O
take O
the O
trouble O
of O
thinking O
before O
she O
spoke O
. O
A O
few O
more O
questions O
might O
probably O
have O
obtained O
, O
if O
not O
the O
truth O
, O
at O
least O
some O
proof O
of O
his O
informer's O
ignorance O
of O
it O
, O
but O
Michael S-PERSON
had O
heard O
enough O
| | O
he O
rose O
to O
his O
feet O
, O
and O
without O
uttering O
another O
word O
, O
rushed O
out O
of O
the O
room O
. O
The O
state O
in O
which O
he O
then O
found O
himself O
was O
certainly O
nearly O
approaching O
to O
delirium O
. O
His O
strength O
of O
body O
and O
mind O
completely O
exhausted O
by O
fatigue O
, O
fasting O
, O
and O
intense O
anxiety O
, O
the O
blow O
which O
had O
fallen O
upon O
him O
was O
heavier O
than O
his O
reason O
could O
bear O
, O
and O
he O
wandered O
forth O
into O
the O
fields O
without O
knowing O
where O
he O
was O
, O
or O
having O
any O
distinct O
idea O
of O
what O
had O
befallen O
him O
. O
His O
devious O
and O
unheeded O
path O
led O
him O
to O
a O
spot O
, O
at O
the O
distance O
of O
nearly B-QUANTITY
a I-QUANTITY
mile E-QUANTITY
from O
his O
former O
home O
, O
at O
which O
several O
miniature O
rocks O
of O
sandstone O
give O
something O
of O
wildness O
and O
dignity O
to O
the O
little O
stream O
, O
which O
for O
the O
most O
part O
runs O
tamely O
enough O
, O
and O
looks O
little O
more O
than O
a O
wide O
and O
dirty O
ditch O
, O
as O
it O
passes O
through O
the O
town O
of O
Ashleigh S-GPE
. O
A O
multitude O
of O
cotton O
- O
factories O
, O
with O
their O
tall O
chimneys O
mocking O
the O
heavens O
, O
were O
visible O
in O
the O
distance O
, O
on O
the O
other O
side O
, O
and O
the O
boy O
stopped O
in O
his O
wild O
, O
hurried O
walk O
, O
to O
gaze O
upon O
them O
, O
with O
a O
feverish O
consciousness O
that O
there O
at O
least O
stood O
something O
he O
had O
seen O
before O
. O
A O
frightful O
flash O
of O
memory O
then O
shot O
across O
his O
brain O
— O
his O
mother O
dead O
— O
his O
darling O
Edward S-PERSON
dead O
— O
himself O
a O
houseless O
, O
friendless O
, O
starving O
wretch O
, O
who O
soon O
would O
be O
caught O
and O
carried O
back O
to O
the O
prison O
- O
house O
he O
had O
ran O
from O
only O
to O
learn O
that O
he O
had O
no O
friend O
on O
earth O
! O
Such O
were O
the O
thoughts O
which O
racked O
him O
, O
as O
he O
stood O
upon O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
rocky O
little O
precipice O
, O
and O
fixed O
his O
eyes O
upon O
the O
quite O
water O
that O
flowed O
some B-QUANTITY
twenty I-QUANTITY
feet E-QUANTITY
beneath O
him O
. O
It O
seemed O
to O
present O
an O
image O
of O
coolness O
and O
repose O
| | O
his O
burning O
lips O
longed O
to O
kiss O
the O
gentle O
ripple O
on O
its O
surface O
— O
he O
drew O
nearer O
to O
the O
extremest O
verge O
. O
" O
I O
should O
be O
safe O
there O
! O
" O
he O
murmured O
, O
looking O
downwards O
till O
his O
sick O
head O
reeled O
. O
" O
God O
forgive O
me O
! O
" O
he O
added O
, O
raising O
his O
eyes O
to O
heaven O
. O
" O
But O
if O
I O
drown O
, O
mother O
! O
I O
shall O
go O
to O
thee O
! O
" O
and O
as O
he O
spoke O
the O
words O
, O
he O
sprang O
forward O
, O
and O
plunged O
into O
the O
stream O
! O
himself O
and O
the O
object O
he O
endeavoured O
to O
reach O
. O
His O
heavy O
shoes O
filled O
with O
water O
, O
and O
dragged O
him O
downwards O
— O
his O
strength O
failed O
, O
his O
arms O
ceased O
to O
move O
, O
and O
in O
another O
moment O
the O
water O
rippled O
over O
his O
head O
. O
But O
poor O
Michael's S-NORP
history O
was O
not O
finished O
yet O
. O
A O
heavy O
- O
looking O
elderly O
man O
, O
who O
had O
as O
little O
as O
possible O
the O
air O
of O
one O
desirous O
of O
seeking O
an O
adventure O
, O
was O
in O
the O
act O
of O
examining O
some O
sheep O
in O
a O
field O
, O
the O
fence O
of O
which O
was O
not O
fifty B-QUANTITY
yards E-QUANTITY
from O
the O
rocky O
ledge O
from O
whence O
the O
boy O
had O
sprung O
. O
Having O
completed O
his O
survey O
, O
and O
directed O
two S-CARDINAL
men O
who O
were O
with O
him O
to O
select O
a O
score O
or O
two S-CARDINAL
from O
the O
lot O
, O
the O
old O
man O
reposed O
himself O
upon O
a O
style O
in O
the O
fence O
above O
mentioned O
, O
and O
having O
chanced O
to O
turn O
his O
head O
from O
the O
sheep O
, O
towards O
the O
spot O
where O
Michael S-PERSON
stood O
, O
had O
watched O
for O
a B-TIME
minute E-TIME
or O
two S-CARDINAL
the O
boy's O
agitated O
movements O
and O
demeanour O
, O
but O
without O
the O
slightest O
suspicion O
of O
the O
frightful O
catastrophe O
that O
was O
to O
ensue O
. O
No O
sooner O
, O
however O
, O
did O
he O
hear O
the O
splash O
occasioned O
by O
the O
plunge O
, O
than O
he O
sprang O
over O
the O
style O
with O
the O
activity O
of O
a O
younger O
man O
, O
and O
calling O
to O
the O
others O
to O
follow O
him O
, O
made O
his O
way O
with O
little O
loss O
of O
time O
, O
to O
a O
bit O
of O
pebbly O
ground O
on O
a O
level O
with O
the O
stream O

at O
no O
great O
distance O

the O
point O
at O
which O
Michael S-PERSON

sunk O

But O
, O
short O
as O
the O
time O
had O
been O
, O
the O
ripple O
had O
already O
disappeared O
from O
the O
surface O
of O
the O
water O
, O
and O
no O
trace O
remained O
of O
the O
object O

his O
search O
. O
The O
two S-CARDINAL
young O
men O
whom O
he O
had O
summoned O
to O
follow O
him O
, O
though O
they O
had O
not O
seen O
the O
accident O
, O
had O
gathered O
from O
his O
words O
that O
something O
terrible O
had O
occurred O
, O
and O
clambering O
down O
the O
rocky O
cliff O

were O
by O

side O

a O
moment O

" O

late O

exclaimed O
the O
old O
man O

wringing O
his O
hands O
together O

" O

rejoined O

" O
" O
The O

would O

" O
continued O
for O
a B-TIME
minute E-TIME
or O
two S-CARDINAL
to O
watch O
the O
place O
where O
he O
had O
fallen O

" O
Halloo S-PERSON

Halloo S-PERSON
! O
Halloo S-PERSON
! O
" O
cried O
a O
voice O
at O
no O
great O
distance O
. O
" O
That's O
William S-PERSON
, O
by O
all O
that's O
good O

" O
exclaimed O
the O
young O
shepherd O
, O
and O
without O
waiting O
for O
his O
companion's O
reply O
, O
he O
ran O
off O
at O
full O
speed O
, O
the O
old O
man O
following O
with O
no O
lagging O
step O
, O
and O
at O
the O
distance O
of O
a O
few O
yards O
, O
after O
turning O
the O
corner O
formed O
by O
another O
huge O
mass O
of O
sandstone O
rock O
, O
they O
perceived O
William S-PERSON
, O
breast O
deep O
in O
the O
water O
, O
and O
grasping O
, O
at O
the O
utmost O
extent O
of O
his O
arm O
, O
a O
limb O
of O
the O
drowning O
boy O
. O
Before O
the O
old O
Westmorland S-GPE
statesman O
( O
for O
such O
he O
was O
) O
could O
overtake O
his O
young O
companions O
, O
the O
hero O
of O
our O
tale O
was O
lying O
high O
and O
dry O
upon O
the O
bank O
, O
but O
whether O
life O
was O
quite O
extinct O
, O
or O
still O
lingered O
in O
the O
cold O
, O
corse O
- O
like O
form O
before O
them O
, O
was O
a O
question O
which O
, O
when O
the O
old O
man O
joined O
the O
group O
, O
the O
young O
ones O
were O
not O
able O
to O
answer O
. O
Luckily O
for O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
the O
old O
statesman O
had O
seen O
a O
man O
saved O
from O
drowning O
some B-DATE
thirty I-DATE
years E-DATE
before O
, O
and O
he O
remembered O
enough O
of O
the O
process O
he O
had O
then O
witnessed O
, O
to O
enable O
him O
to O
give O
some O
very O
useful O
instructions O
on O
the O
present O
occasion O
. O
They O
managed O
to O
make O
their O
patient O
discharge O
from O
his O
mouth O
some O
portion O
of O
the O
superfluous O
draught O
he O
had O
swallowed O
, O
and O
after O
bestowing O
patient O
and O
assiduous O
friction O
on O
his O
breast O
and O
limbs O
, O
they O
had O
the O
great O
satisfaction O
of O
seeing O
the O
chest O
heave O
with O
returning O
respiration O
, O
and O
all O
other O
symptoms O
of O
revivification O
follow O
in O
their O
proper O
order O
, O
till O
the O
eyes O
of O
Michael S-PERSON
were O
once O
more O
widely O
opened O
, O
and O
fixed O
with O
preplexity O
, O
and O
something O
like O
terror O
, O
on O
the O
faces O
which O
were O
bending O
over O
him O
. O
" O
Thank O
Heaven O
! O
" O
ejaculated O
the O
old O
man O
earnestly O
, O
" O
he's O
safe O
now O
, O
at O
least O
from O
drowning O
, O
and O
I O
have O
not O
got O
that O
to O
answer O
for O
. O
But O
he O
isn't O
in O
a O
trim O
to O
be O
left O
, O
my O
lads O
. O
He O
would O
have O
been O
as O
well O
in O
the O
river O
, O
perhaps O
, O
as O
out O
of O
it O
, O
if O
we O
do O
no O
more O
for O
him O
. O
" O
Then O
causing O
Michael S-PERSON
to O
sit O
, O
and O
examining O
his O
features O
, O
with O
a O
glance O
of O
very O
friendly O
curiosity O
, O
he O
said O
, O
" O
You O
don't O
look O
like O
a O
bad O
boy O
, O
my O
poor O
fellow O
. O
What O
could O
have O
set O
you O
upon O
doing O
such O
a O
desperate O
action O
? O
" O
The O
effort O
which O
the O
poor O
boy O
made O
to O
answer O
was O
ineffectual O
, O
and O
he O
only O
shook O
his O
head O
. O
" O
I O
suppose O
it's O
oversoon O
as O
yet O
, O
to O
expect O
any O
information O
from O
him O
, O
" O
resumed O
the O
old O
man O
, O
" O
so O
there's O
nothing O
to O
be O
done O
, O
as O
I O
see O
, O
but O
just O
to O
carry O
him O
up O
between O
us O
, O
if O
he O
cannot O
walk O
, O
to O
the B-PERSON
Nag's I-PERSON
Head E-PERSON
, O
and O
have O
him O
laid O
upon O
my O
bed O
there O
, O
till O
he O
is O
a O
condition O
to O
tell O
us O
something O
about O
himself O
. O
Can O
you O
feel O
your O
legs O
yet O
, O
my O
boy O
? O
" O
he O
continued O
, O
endeavouring O
, O
by O
the O
help O
of O
his O
man O
William S-PERSON
, O
to O
make O
him O
stand O
up O
. O
days O
of O
yore O
, O
but O
not O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
them O
recognised O
the O
widow O
Armstrong's S-PERSON
boy O
, O
in O
the O
long O
- O
limbed O
, O
pallid O
figure O
, O
that O
they O
now O
gazed O
upon O
. O
Muster B-PERSON
Thornton E-PERSON
, O
the O
Westmorland S-GPE
yeoman O
and O
farmer O
, O
was O
too O
substantial O
a O
customer O
to O
be O
refused O
any O
reasonable O
favour O
, O
and O
the O
ragged O
, O
dripping O
Michael S-PERSON
was O
not O
only O
permitted O
to O
lie O
down O
on O
Muster B-ORG
Thornton's E-ORG
best O
of O
beds O
, O
but O
accommodated O
promptly O
with O
dry O
linen O
, O
and O
duly O
comforted O
with O
more O
hot O
brandy O
, O
water O
, O
sugar O
, O
and O
biscuits O
than O
he O
had O
any O
inclination O
to O
swallow O
. O
He O
took O
enough O
, O
however O
, O
to O
remove O
the O
faintness O
of O
inanition O
| | O
and O
this O
, O
together O
with O
dry O
linen O
, O
and O
a O
bed O
, O
sufficed O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
heavy O
sorrows O
upon O
which O
his O
mind O
had O
not O
yet O
dared O
to O
fix O
itself O
, O
to O
sooth O
him O
into O
a O
long O
and O
healing O
sleep O
. O
When O
he O
awoke O
from O
it O
, O
he O
was O
capable O
of O
answering O
all O
the O
questions O
Mr. O
Thornton S-PERSON
put O
to O
him O
, O
and O
this O
he O
did O
with O
a O
simplicity O
of O
pathos O
that O
went O
straight O
to O
the O
good O
man's O
heart O
. O
That O
he O
had O
been O
working O
in O
a O
distant O
cotton O
- O
factory O
, O
where O
he O
had O
been O
very O
hardly O
treated O
, O
and O
having O
got O
away O
to O
see O
his O
mother O
and O
his O
brother O
, O
had O
found O
them O
both O
dead O
, O
was O
a O
tale O
, O
that O
if O
it O
could O
not O
excuse O
the O
desperate O
act O
which O
he O
had O
attempted O
, O
at O
least O
accounted O
for O
it O
, O
in O
a O
manner O
that O
left O
as O
much O
to O
pity O
as O
to O
blame O
. O
" O
Poor O
boy O
! O
poor O
boy O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
the O
old O
man O
, O
with O
tears O
in O
his O
eyes O
. O
" O
It O
was O
wrong O
and O
wicked O
, O
very O
wrong O

wicked O
! O
but O
you O
must O
pray O
God O
to O
forgive O
you O
, O
my O
boy O

never O

" O
I O

was O
about O

I O

rightly O
, O
" O
said O
Michael S-PERSON

" O
My O
head O
seemed O
gone O

I O
don't O
know O
how O
I O
got O
to O
the O
river O

I O
am O
sure O

did O
not O

there O

much O
the O
better O

I O
am O
glad O

it O

it's O
no O
great O
wonder O

sure O
enough O
, O
if O
you O
did O
lose O
your O
head O

coming O
to O
such O
a O
home O

what O
are O
you O
to O
do O
next O

To O
this O
green O
republic O
Michael S-PERSON
turned O
himself O
, O
and O
knew O
full O
surely O
that O
it O
was O
there O
his O
mother O
lay O
. O
Another O
, O
though O
even O
as O
humble O
as O
himself O
, O
might O
, O
under O
similar O
feelings O
, O
have O
addressed O
inquiries O
to O
the O
parish O
- O
sexton O
, O
and O
endeavoured O
to O
set O
his O
memory O
to O
work O
as O
to O
the O
exact O
spot O
where O
he O
had O
buried O
her O
— O
but O
this O
Michael S-PERSON
dared O
not O
do O
| | O
for O
it O
would O
be O
at O
once O
losing O
the O
advantage O
of O
his O
incognito O
, O
and O
laying O
himself O
very O
needlessly O
open O
to O
the O
danger O
of O
being O
reclaimed O
by O
his O
old O
enemy O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
as O
a O
bound O
apprentice O
, O
who O
had O
run O
away O
. O
So O
he O
contented O
himself O
with O
walking O
carefully O
, O
and O
with O
reverential O
tread O
, O
through O
and O
amongst O
the O
many O
grassy O
mounds O
, O
permitting O
his O
tears O
to O
flow O
freely O
as O
he O
thought O
of O
Teddy S-PERSON
, O
and O
the O
dear O
gentle O
mother O
who O
had O
so O
equally O
loved O
them O
both O
| | O
and O
then O
turned O
slowly O
away O
, O
following O
a O
path O
that O
brought O
him O
at O
the O
distance O
of O
a O
mile O
or O
so O
to O
Brookford S-ORG
factory O
. O
The O
sensation O
which O
he O
felt O
when O
the O
great O
many O
- O
eyed O
monster O
first S-ORDINAL
met O
his O
sight O
, O
was O
one O
of O
unmixed O
pleasure O
. O
He O
literally O
hugged O
himself O
, O
and O
blessed O
the O
freedom O
of O
his O
limbs O
, O
the O
firm O
and O
healthy O
action O
of O
his O
pulse O
, O
and O
the O
delicious O
consciousness O
that O
he O
was O
no O
man's O
slave O
. O
For O
many B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
he O
stood O
still O
to O
enjoy O
this O
| | O
and O
as O
his O
eyes O
perused O
line O
after O
line O
of O
the O
dusky O
smoke O
- O
stained O
windows O
, O
and O
recalled O
the O
early O
sufferings O
he O
had O
endured O
within O
them O
, O
his O
very O
heart O
swelled O
with O
gratitude O
for O
the O
change O
, O
and O
he O
blessed O
God O
aloud O
. O
But O
as O
he O
approached O
nearer O
, O
and O
perceived O
the O
dim O
shadowy O
figures O
slowly O
moving O
here O
and O
there O
, O
and O
thought O
upon O
the O
condition O
of O
each O
of O
them O
, O
he O
almost O
repented O
of O
his O
selfish O
joy O
, O
and O
blamed O
the O
ecstasy O
that O
for O
a O
while O
had O
made O
him O
so O
utterly O
forget O
that O
thousands S-CARDINAL
were O
imprisoned O
still O
, O
though O
he O
was O
free O
. O
On O
, O
and O
on O
, O
he O
walked O
with O
his O
eyes O
immovably O
fixed O
upon O
the O
hideous O
fabric O
till O
, O
sooner O
than O
he O
expected O
it O
, O
he O
stood O
before O
the O
gates O
. O
He O
had O
connived O
no O
previous O
plan O
by O
which O
to O
enter O
it O
, O
and O
knew O
that O
without O
some O
specific O
business O
, O
real O
or O
feigned O
, O
it O
would O
be O
impossible O
| | O
but O
while O
he O
stood O
weighing O
the O
danger O
of O
possible O
discovery O
against O
his O
very O
strong O
inclination O
to O
see O
what O
alteration O
time O
had O
made O
in O
the O
troop O
within O
— O
whether O
he O
should O
recognise O
any O
among O
them O
— O
and O
whether O
his O
old O
tyrant O
, O
Parsons S-PERSON
, O
was O
still O
their O
chief O
, O
— O
the O
gates O
opened O
, O
and O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
engine O
- O
men O
, O
a O
grizzly O
fellow O
, O
whom O
he O
well O
remembered O
when O
his O
sable O
hair O
was O
somewhat O
less O
silvered O
, O
came O
forth O
. O
He O
gave O
Michael S-PERSON
a O
look O
, O
that O
very O
plainly O
said O
, O
" O
What O
do O
you O
and O
in O
truth O
, O
his O
neat O
appearance O
, O
unstained O
skin O
, O
and O
free O
unshrinking O
eye O
, O
very O
naturally O
suggested O
the O
idea O
that O
he O
could O
have O
no O
business O
there O
. O
" O
Is O
Mr. O
Parsons S-PERSON
within O
? O
" O
said O
Michael S-PERSON
boldly O
, O
and O
daring O
the O
inquiry O
as O
much O
because O
he O
knew O
not O
what O
to O
say O
, O
as O
from O
any O
deliberate O
resolution O
to O
do O
so O
. O
" O
Yes O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
man O
| | O
" O
he O
is O
about O
the O
place O
somewhere O
, O
I O
seed O
him O
not O
more B-TIME
than I-TIME
ten I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
ago E-TIME
. O
" O
Michael S-PERSON
nodded O
his O
head O
, O
and O
walked O
through O
the O
gate O
into O
the O
court O
, O
across O
which O
he O
had O
passed O
in O
trembling O
a B-CARDINAL
thousand E-CARDINAL
times O
. O
Nor O
was O
he O
now O
quite O
free O
from O
a O
slight O
feeling O
of O
alarm O
at O
the O
idea O
of O
meeting O
the O
sharp O
eyes O
of O
his O
former O
terrible O
taskmaster O
, O
and O
felt O
much O
inclined O
to O
blame O
himself O
for O
the O
curious O
temerity O
which O
had O
brought O
him O
so O
nearly O
within O
his O
gripe O
. O
But O
it O
was O
too O
late O
to O
retreat O
, O
for O
at O
the O
distance O
of O
a B-QUANTITY
dozen I-QUANTITY
yards E-QUANTITY
he O
saw O
Parsons S-PERSON
before O
him O
, O
coming O
forth O
from O
the O
building O
into O
the O
court O
. O
On O
seeing O
the O
stranger O
he O
immediately O
approached O
him O
| | O
Michael S-PERSON
touched O
his O
hat O
. O
" O
What O
may O
your O
business O
here O
be O
, O
young O
man O
? O
" O
said O
Parsons S-PERSON
eyeing O
him O
from O
top O
to O
toe O
. O
" O
I O
called O
in O
, O
sir O
, O
to O
inquire O
whether O
you O
happened O
to O
want O
a O
spinner O
, O
and O
what O
the O
wages O
may O
be O
, O
" O
said O
Michael S-PERSON
. O
" O
Is O
it O
for O
yourself O
? O
" O
demanded O
Parsons S-PERSON
, O
knitting O
his O
brows O
, O
and O
looking O
at O
him O
with O
a O
sort O
of O
incredulous O
sneer O
. O
" O
Why O
, O
no O
sir O
, O
it O
is O
for O
a O
kinsman O
who O
happens O
to O
be O
out O
of O
employ O
, O
" O
replied O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
colouring O
from O
the O
unusual O
consciousness O
of O
deceit O
, O
and O
from O
the O
same O
cause O
casting O
his O
eyes O
upon O
the O
ground O
, O
thereby O
displaying O
the O
remarkable O
length O
of O
his O
black O
eyelashes O
, O
and O
giving O
to O
his O
whole O
countenance O
a O
look O
much O
more O
resembling O
that O
of O
former O
days O
, O
than O
he O
had O
worn O
when O
he O
first S-ORDINAL
entered O
. O
Parsons S-PERSON
looked O
at O
him O
with O
a O
sort O
of O
vague O
idea O
that O
he O
had O
seen O
him O
before O
. O
" O
Where O
do O
you O
come O
from O
? O
" O
said O
he O
. O
" O
From O
Westmorland S-GPE
, O
sir O
. O
I O
have O
been O
living O
in O
service O
there O
for O
these O
four B-DATE
years E-DATE
past O

" O
" O
And O
pray O
what O
may O
your O
name O
be O
? O
" O
" O
Robert B-PERSON
Thornton E-PERSON
, O
sir O
, O
" O
replied O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
blushing O
again O
, O
as O
he O
thus O
unceremoniously O
borrowed O
the O
appellation O
of O
his O
worthy O
master O
. O
" O
Have O
you O
ever O
worked O
in O
a O
factory O
yourself O
? O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
sir O
, O
I O
have O
, O
when O
I O
was O
a O
boy O
, O
" O
said O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
from O
mere O
want O
of O
skill O
and O
hardihood O
in O
the O
art O
of O
lying O
. O
" O
And O
you O
think O
you O
have O
bettered O
yourself O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
with O
your O
fine O
buff O
waistcoat O
, O
and O
the O
rest O
of O
it O
. O
No O
we O
don't O
want O
no O
spinners O
here O
. O
" O
Michael S-PERSON
by O
no O
means O
unwillingly O
obeyed O
this O
dismissal O
, O
and O
walked O
away O
, O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
half E-CARDINAL
ashamed O
of O
his O
achievement O
. O
addressed O
to O
the O
overlooker O
, O
but O
to O
another O
girl O
, O
who O
had O
brought O
the O
speaker O
her O
dinner O
to O
prevent O
her O
leaving O
some O
particular O
work O
on O
which O
she O
was O
employed O
. O
" O
What's O
that O
you O
say O
, O
Sykes S-PERSON
? O
" O
said O
Parsons S-PERSON
, O
turning O
quickly O
towards O
her O
. O
" O
I O
was O
saying O
, O
sir O

as O
that O
boy O
was O
unaccountable O

Michael B-PERSON
Armstrong E-PERSON

used O
to O
live O
in O
mother's O

All O
the O

years B-DATE

fuss O
enough O
there O
was O
made O
about O
it O
by O
that O
mad O
miss O
at O
Milford S-GPE

I O

found O
out O

was O
their O
cousin O

something O
of O
the O
sort O

for O
she O
took O
it O
so O
to O
heart O

that O
she O
sold O
her O
house O

lands O

ran O
away O
with O
another O
of O

some O
foreign O

all O

queer O

the O

I O
remember O
it O

Kitty O

the O
liberty O

but O
to O
say O
the O
truth O
, O
she O
had O
no O

all O

Mr. O

catch O
him O
up O

enough O
not O

the O
opinion O

friend O
Mr. O

thought O

far O
the O
handsomest O
young O
fellow O
she O
had O
ever O
seen O

secretly O

of O
him O
again O

him O

clear O

his O
old O
acquaintance O

" O
There O
he O
goes O

cried O
Parsons S-PERSON

watching O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
as O
with O
upright O
gait O
, O
and O
rapid O
strides O
, O
he O
was O
pursuing O
his O
way O

the O
well O

remembered O
path O

led O
from O

" O
There O
he O

don't O
look O
like O

yet O
the O

you O
hear O
him O

" O
Yes O

sir O

the O
girl O

" O

it O
was O
just O
then O
as O

felt O
so O
unaccountable O
sure O

it O

out O

can O

I O
know O

run O

bring O
him O
back O

Kitty O

a O
darling O

say O
as O
I O
have O
got O
some O
good O
news O
to O
tell O
him O

" O
Off O
started O
the O
girl O
with O
right O
good O
- O
will O

having O
her O
own O
reasons O
for O
wishing O
to O
do O
the O
errand O
, O
as O
well O
as O
a O
very O
sufficient O
inclination O

gain O
the O
promised O
reward O
. O
Mr. O
Parsons S-PERSON
by O
no O
means O
over O

rated O
her O
running O
powers O

had O
she O
been O
less O
fleet O
, O
she O
would O
have O
failed O
in O
her O
object O
, O
for O
Michael S-PERSON
walked O
briskly O
, O
and O
without O
any O
inclination O
to O
remain O
longer O
in O
the O
vicinity O
of O
the O
mill O
, O
though O
by O
no O
means O
conscious O
that O
he O
had O
been O
recognised O
. O
He O
had O
just O
turned O
the O
corner O
of O
a O
hedge O
when O
the O
girl O
overtook O
him O
, O
so O
that O
their O
colloquy O
did O
not O
take O
place O
within O
sight O
of O
the O
overlooker O
. O
Michael S-PERSON
heard O
the O
fair O
Kitty's S-PERSON
approach O
, O
and O
turned O
to O
see O
who O
it O
was O
that O
thus O
came O
galloping O
and O
panting O
after O
him O
. O
" O
Do O
you O
want O
me O
, O
young O
woman O
? O
" O
said O
he O
, O
civilly O
stopping O
for O
her O
. O
" O
Well O
then O
, O
you O
are O
no O
changeling O

the O

laying O
her O
hand O
on O
his O
arm O

you O

out O

out O

A O
very O
bright O
suffusion O
dyed O
the O
clear O
brown O
of O
Michael's S-PERSON

he O
heard O
this O

, O
" O
you O

Don't O
you O
remember O

gone O

from O
the O

it O
indeed O
Kitty B-PERSON
Sykes E-PERSON

grown O
into O
such O
a O
handsome O
young O
woman O

" O
said O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
holding O
out O
his O
hand O
to O
her O
, O
and O
feeling O
quite O
incapable O
of O
preserving O
his O
incognito O
, O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
so O
old O
an O
acquaintance O

" O
And O
to O
think O
of O
your O
knowing O
me O

Kitty S-PERSON
! O
But O
you O
must O
not O
betray O
me O
, O
my O
dear O
girl O
. O
If O
I O
was O
found O
out O
for O
Michael B-PERSON

I O
might O
get O
into O
a O
scrape O

" O
be O
to O
give O
you O
notice O
to O
march O
into O
prison O
for O
having O
run O
away O

and O
I O
agreed O
to O
carry O
his O
message O
for O
him O

He O
thinks O
that O
I O
delight O
in O
him O
, O
the O
old O
monster O
! O
but O
I'd O
rather O
walk O
a O
mile O
to O
do O
a O
kindness O
to O
you O
Michael S-PERSON

than O
stir O
an O

God O

you O

hope O
you O
have O
done O
me O
a O
great O
service O
now O

would O
find O
it O
difficult O

now O
good O

it O

" O
No O

you O

you O

be O
easy O
enough O

back O

tell O

tell O
you O

come O
down O

often O

so O
happy O

that O
I O

it O
would O
be O
a O
terrible O
change O

into O
the B-LOC
Deep I-LOC
Valley I-LOC

again O

is O

much O
worse O

looked O
about O
him O
for O
some O
means O
of O
occupation O
during O
the O
hours O
which O
he O
had O
doomed O
himself O
to O
pass O
there O
, O
and O
in O
despair O
of O
finding O
any O
better O
literary O
amusement O
, O
seized O
upon O
a O
heap O
of O
handbills O
, O
of O
a O
vast O
variety O
of O
external O
forms O
, O
but O
having O
, O
as O
he O
found O
upon O
examination O
, O
one O
and O
all O
the O
same O
object O
, O
namely O
, O
the O
calling O
together O

general O
meeting O
of O
the O
whole O
county O

York S-GPE
( O

for O
the O
purpose O

signing O
a O
petition O
to O
parliament O
for O
a O
law O
, O
limiting O
the O
hours O

labour O
in O
factories O
to O
ten B-TIME

a O
day O
. O
Michael B-PERSON
Armstrong E-PERSON
was O
no O
longer O
a O
factory O
operative O
| | O
free O
as O
the O
air O
he O
breathed O
upon O
his O
beloved O
mountain O
- O
tops O
, O
he O
no O
longer O
trembled O
at O
the O
omnipotent O
frown O
of O
an O
overlooker O
, O
nor O
sickened O
as O
he O
watched O
the O
rising O
sun O
that O
was O
to O
set O
again O
long O
hours O
before O
his O
stifling O
labour O
ceased O
. O
All O
this O
was O
over O
and O
ended O
with O
him O
for O
ever O
. O
Yet O
did O
his O
heart O
throb O
, O
and O
his O
eye O
kindle O
as O
he O
perused O
page O
after O
page O
of O
the O
arousing O
call O
which O
summoned O
tens B-CARDINAL
of I-CARDINAL
thousands E-CARDINAL
, O
nay O
hundreds B-CARDINAL
of I-CARDINAL
thousands E-CARDINAL
to O
use O
the O
right O
their O
country O
vested O
in O
them O
, O
of O
imploring O
mercy O
and O
justice O
from O
the O
august O
tripartite O
power O
that O
ruled O
the O
land O
. O
Very O
powerful O
was O
the O
male O
and O
simple O
eloquence O
with O
which O
many O
of O
these O
unpretending O
compositions O
appealed O
to O
the O
paternal O
feelings O
of O
those O
they O
addressed O
| | O
and O
such O
terribly O
true O
representations O
were O
found O
among O
them O
of O
the O
well O
- O
remembered O
agonies O
of O
his O
boyhood O
, O
that O
Michael S-PERSON
was O
fain O
to O
put O
his O
spread O
hand O
before O
his O
face O
to O
conceal O
the O
emotions O
they O
produced O
. O
He O
had O
sat O
in O
this O
situation O
for O
some B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
, O
revolving O
both O
his O
former O
sufferings O
, O
and O
the O
blessedness O
of O
his O
present O
release O
from O
them O
, O
when O
a O
man O
, O
who O
had O
been O
quietly O
sitting O
writing O
at O
a O
distant O
window O
, O
but O
had O
nevertheless O
found O
leisure O
to O
watch O
Michael's S-PERSON
countenance O
as O
he O
proceeded O
with O
his O
examination O
of O
the O
handbills O
, O
rose O
from O
his O
place O
, O
and O
gently O
approaching O
him O
said O
, O
in O
deep O
, O
yet O
very O
gentle O
voice O
, O
" O
You O
seem O
moved O
by O
the O
perusal O
of O
these O
papers O
, O
my O
good O
friend O
. O
Is O
it O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
you O
have O
met O
with O
them O
? O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
indeed O
, O
sir O
, O
it O
is O
, O
" O
replied O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
starting O
from O
his O
revery O
. O
" O
Then O
I O
presume O
you O
are O
a O
stranger O
in O
this O
part O
of O
the O
country O
? O
" O
" O
Why O
, O
yes O
, O
sir O
| | O
the O
master O
I O
serve O
is O
a O
Westmorland S-NORP
statesman O
, O
and O
I O
am O
only O
come O
this O
way O
upon O
a O
holiday O
trip O
. O
" O
" O
Then O
maybe O
you O
don't O
care O
enough O
for O
the O
poor O
factory O
operatives O
to O
join O
their O
meeting O
, O
and O
put O
your O
name O
to O
their O
petition O
? O
" O
" O
If O
caring O
for O
them O
could O
do O
them O
any O
good O
, O
master O
, O
" O
replied O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
warmly O
, O
" O
they O
would O
be O
in O
no O
want O
of O
help O
, O
as O
long O
as O
I O
was O
near O
them O
. O
But O
I O
don't O
think O
the O
name O
of O
a O
poor O
servant O
- O
boy O
like O
me O
, O
could O
do O
them O
either O
honour O
or O
service O
. O
" O
" O
Then O
what O
sort O
of O
names O
, O
my O
good O
lad O
, O
do O
you O
suppose O
will O
support O
this O
petition O
. O
Do O
you O
think O
the O
great O
mill O
- O
owners O
will O
sign O
it O
? O
— O
Do O
you O
think O
such O
men O
as O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
for O
instance O
, O
whom O
you O
may O
have O
heard O
spoken O
of O
, O
down O
at O
Ashleigh S-PERSON
, O
maybe O
, O
do O
you O
think O
it O
will O
be O
such O
as O
he O
, O
whose O
first S-ORDINAL
object O
in O
life O
is O
to O
get O
as O
many O
hours O
of O
labour O
out O
of O
the O
little O
creatures O
that O
work O
for O
him O
, O
as O
stripes O
can O
make O
them O
give O
, O
do O
you O
think O
it O
will O
be O
such O
as O
he O
, O
that O
will O
sign O
the O
ten B-TIME
hours E-TIME
bill O
? O
" O
" O
Not O
if O
that O
bill O
is O
either O
to O
hurt O
himself O
, O
or O
better O
the O
children O
, O
I O
should O
think O
, O
" O
said O
Michael S-PERSON
. O
" O
True O
enough O
, O
" O
replied O
his O
new O
acquaintance O
, O
" O
and O
not O
only O
is O
that O
true O
, O
but O
he O
and O
the O
like O
of O
him O
will O
do O
all O
that O
mortal O
men O
can O
, O
to O
prevent O
all O
others O
from O
signing O
it O

But O
Heaven O
forbid O
they O
should O
succeed O
, O
young O
man O
— O
for O
if O
they O
do O
, O
the O
best O
hope O
of O
many B-CARDINAL
thousand E-CARDINAL
suffering O
, O

most O
helpless O
human O
beings O
, O
will O
fall O
to O
the O
ground O

" O
" O
Then O
, O
indeed O
, O
may O
Heaven O
forbid O
that O
they O
should O
have O
their O
will O
! O
" O
returned O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
fervently O
. O
" O
When O
is O
this O
meeting O
to O
take O
place O
? O
" O
he O
added O
, O
turning O
his O
eyes O
again O
to O
the O
papers O
he O
still O
held O
in O
his O
hand O

" O

three B-DATE

truly O

" O
Is O
there O
any O
reason O
against O
your O
doing O

demanded O
the O
stranger O

" O
Will O
your O
services O

me O
, O
till O
two S-CARDINAL
or O
three B-DATE
days E-DATE
after O
it O
, O
" O
replied O
Michael S-PERSON

" O
I O
have O
done O
all O
I O
wanted O

at O

stayed O
as O
long O

I O
wished O
at O
Ashleigh S-PERSON

I O
don't O

" O
Do O

it O

my O
good O
lad O

" O
said O
the O
stranger O

" O
I O
predict O
that O
it O
will O
offer O
a O
spectacle O
such O
as O
never O
was O
witnessed O
before O
, O
and O
most O
likely O
never O
will O
, O
or O
can O
be O
seen O
, O
again O

A O
multitude O
, O
probably O
amounting O
to O
above B-CARDINAL
a I-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
thousand E-CARDINAL
overworked O
operatives O
, O
will O
meet O
in O
peace O

good O
order O

to O
petition O
for O
legal O
relief O
from O
the O
oppression O
of O
a O
system O

has O
brought O
them O
to O
a O
lower O
state O

misery O

ever O

Were O
those O
in O
whom O
these O
poor O
people O
have O
confidence O
, O
less O
deeply O
anxious O
to O
preserve O
the O
public O
peace O

they O
are O
, O
a O
different O
mode O
of O
redress O
might O
be O
sought O
for O

as O
it O
is O
, O
an O
honest O
man O
may O
venture O
to O
advise O
such O

" O
A O
good O
deal O
more O
conversation O
followed O
on O
the O

theme O

and O
ere O
Michael S-PERSON
had O
ceased O
to O
listen O
to O
his O

he O
felt O

duty O

him O

do O
all O

In O
a O
word O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
Armstrong E-PERSON
determined O

great O
Yorkshire S-GPE

hold O
up O
his O
hand O
for O
the O
ten B-TIME

The O
extraordinary O
circumstances O
attending O
that O
enormous O
meeting O

the O
unaccountable O
for O
the O
multitude O

while O
beer O
was O
every O

in O
the O

the O
terror O

the O
triumphant O
influence O

In O
returning O
to O
Ashleigh S-PERSON
for O
his O
bundle O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
took O
good O
care O
to O
be O
as O
little O
seen O
as O
possible O

he O
was O
in O

more O
than O

the O
more O
he O
meditated O
on O
his O
recollections O

Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON

Parsons S-PERSON
, O
the O
more O
did O
he O
feel O
convinced O
that O
should O

fall O
into O
their O
power O
before O
the O
age O
of O
twenty B-DATE
- I-DATE
one E-DATE
, O
matters O
would O
go O
very O
hard O
with O
him O
. O
At O
the O
great O
assembling O
of O
the O
people O
at O
York S-GPE
, O
he O
feared O
not O

should O
encounter O
any O
enemy O

the O
only O
human O

designate O

show O
themselves O
at O
the O
most O
distant O
part O
of O
the O

, O
rather O
than O
before O
the O
face O

the O

to O
be O
expected O
there O
. O
No O
feelings O
of O
distrust O
or O
alarm O
, O
therefore O
, O
arose O
to O
check O
the O
pleasurable O
excitement O

this O
expedition O
was O
calculated O
to O
inspire O

Michael S-PERSON
, O
with O
his O
stout O
staff O
over O
his O
shoulder O

the O
cotton O
handkerchief O
, O
containing O

suspended O
from O

out O
with O
a O
light O
heart O

active O
step O
upon O

he O
soon O
found O
himself O
joined O
by O
many B-CARDINAL

companions O

The O
assurance O
given O
him O
by O
his O
unknown O
acquaintance O
, O
that O
he O
should O
see O
a O
wonderful O
and O
spirit O
- O
stirring O
spectacle O
, O
was O
fully O
verified O
. O
The O
very O
sight O
of O
the O
road O
along O
which O
he O
travelled O
, O
which O
looked O
like O
a O
dark O
and O
mighty O
current O
moving O
irresistibly O
along O
, O
while O
tributary O
streams O
flowed O
into O
it O
on O
all O
sides O
, O
so O
thick O
and O
serried O
was O
the O
mass O
that O
moved O
along O
it O
, O
was O
of O
itself O
well O
worth O
the O
toil O
it O
cost O
him O
, O
to O
behold O
its O
peaceful O
tumult O
. O
From O
time O
to O
time O
Michael S-PERSON
indulged O
in O
a O
little O
questioning O
of O
the O
various O
individuals O
beside O
whom O
he O
found O
himself O

but O
for O
the O
most O
part O
the O
men O
were O
too O

upon O
the O
object O
of O
their O
expedition O
, O
to O
converse O
idly O
respecting O
it O
— O
and O
by O
degrees O
our O
hero O
grew O
as O
silent O
as O
the O
rest O
, O
and O
trudged O
on O
without O
any O
other O
communion O
than O
that O
of O
his O
own O
thoughts O
. O
It O
was O
at O
about B-QUANTITY
twenty I-QUANTITY
miles E-QUANTITY
distance O
from O
York S-GPE
, O
when O
the O
multitude O
were O
on O
their O
return O
, O
that O
a O
circumstance O
occurred O
, O
which O
, O
being O
of O
considerable O
importance O
to O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
must O
be O
detailed O
somewhat O
at O
length O
. O
He O
had O
entered O
an O
inn O
by O
the O
road O
- O
side O
, O
which O
, O
being O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
largest O
post O
- O
houses O
on O
the O
north O
road O
, O
had O
an O
air O
of O
pretension O
and O
costliness O
about O
it O
, O
that O
caused O
the O
great O
majority O
of O
the O
host O
to O
walk O
on O
, O
without O
venturing O
to O
approach O
precincts O
so O
dangerous O
. O
But O
Michael S-PERSON
was O
much O
exhausted O
, O
and O
having O
already O
discovered O
, O
when O
passing O
before O
the O
humbler O
houses O
of O
public O
entertainment O
, O
that O
no O
rest O
could O
be O
hoped O
from O
entering O
them O
, O
every O
inch O
of O
space O
being O
occupied O
, O
he O
deemed O
it O
wisest O
to O
disburse O
a O
splendid O
shilling O
, O
rather O
than O
fag O
on O
till O
he O
had O
no O
strength O
to O
go O
further O
. O
were O
not O
many O
of O
his O
fellow O
- O
travellers O
either O
rich O
or O
extravagant O
enough O
to O
share O
these O
splendid O
quarters O
with O
him O
, O
there O
were O
, O
nevertheless O
, O
three S-CARDINAL
or O
four S-CARDINAL
men O
taking O
refreshment O
in O
the O
apartment O
. O
One S-CARDINAL
of O
these O
, O
an O
elderly O
respectable O
- O
looking O
personage O
, O
who O
had O
, O
as O
it O
seemed O
, O
exclusive O
possession O
of O
a O
snug O
little O
round O
- O
table O
in O
a O
corner O
, O
made O
a O
sign O
to O
Michael S-PERSON
to O
share O
it O
with O
him O
. O
This O
was O
gratefully O
accepted O
, O
the O
loaf O
and O
cheese O
were O
already O
there O
, O
and O
the O
foaming O
tankard O
quickly O
followed O
. O
" O
I O
marked O
you O
at O
the O
meeting O
, O
" O
said O
his O
sociable O
companion O
. O
" O
It O
did O
my O
heart O
good O
to O
see O
a O
sprinkling O

them O

come O
out O
of O
pure O
love O

kindness O
to O

poor O

having O
nothing O

' O
Tis O
a O
pity O

idly O
by O

such O
a O
business O

just O

nothing O

they O
are O

more O

replied O
Michael S-PERSON

" O
that O
is O
, O
if O
you O

enough O

an O
accent O

surprise O

I O
should O
never O

her O
, O
my O
lad O

" O
he O
added O
, O
after O
a O
pause O
. O
" O
Yes O
, O
sir O
, O
I O
remember O
her O
very O
well O

but O
please O
to O
go O
on O

" O
" O
Well O
then O
, O
this O
widow O
Armstrong S-PERSON
had O
two S-CARDINAL
sons O
, O
and O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
them O
was O
had O
up O
to O
the O
great O
house O
, O
Dowling B-FAC
Lodge E-FAC
, O
I O
mean O
, O
for O
some O
nonsensical O
reason O
or O
other O
| | O
and O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
pretended O
to O
make O
the O
greatest O
fuss O
in O
the O
world O
about O
him O
, O
and O
the O
whole O
country O
was O
talking O
about O
it O
. O
But O
for O
some O
offence O
of O
the O
poor O
boy's O
, O
I O
never O
rightly O
heard O
what O
, O
the O
old O
sinner O
determined O
upon O
sending O
him O
' O
prentice O
to O
the O
most O
infernal O
place O
, O
by O
all O
account O
, O
that O
the O
earth O
has O
got O
to O
be O
ashamed O
of O
. O
And O
how O
do O
you O
think O
the O
poor O
widow O
was O
coaxed O
over O
to O
sign O
the O
indentures O
? O
Why O
by O
your O
friend O
, O
Miss O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
and O
no O
one O
else O
, O
and O
that O
I O
know O
upon O
the O
best O
authority O
. O
Well O
, O
' O
tis O
a O
long O
story O
, O
the O
ins O
and O
outs O
of O
it O
, O
and O
I O
can't O
say O
that O
I O
ever O
rightly O
understood O
the O
whole O
, O
but O
this O
I O
know O
to O
be O
fact O
: O
that O
our O
young O
mistress O
took O
the O
whole O
thing O
so O
much O
to O
heart O
, O
that O
she O
actually O
set O
out O
to O
look O
after O
the O
boy O
| | O
but O
when O
she O
got O
to O
the O
murderous O
place O
the O
poor O
little O
fellow O
was O
dead O
! O
And O
what O
did O
she O
do O
then O
, O
dear O
, O
tender O
- O
hearted O
lady O
! O
but O
bring O
back O
a O
pretty O
little O
girl O
instead O
of O
him O
, O
because O
, O
as O
we O
all O
guessed O
, O
she O
was O
determined O
to O
save O
somebody O
. O
" O
The O
emotion O
of O
Michael B-PERSON
Armstrong E-PERSON
on O
hearing O
this O
, O
was O
so O
entirely O
beyond O
his O
power O
to O
conquer O
, O
that O
he O
lost O
all O
capability O
of O
utterance O
, O
and O
instead O
of O
asking O
the O
name O
of O
the O
little O
girl O
— O
an O
inquiry O
which O
he O
in O
vain O
strove O
to O
make O
— O
he O
sat O
pale O
and O
gasping O
, O
with O
his O
eyes O
fixed O
on O
the O
speaker O
, O
and O
every O
limb O
trembling O
. O
" O
The O
Lord O
have O
mercy O
on O
us O
! O
what O
is O
the O
matter O
with O
you O
, O
my O
good O
fellow O
? O
" O
said O
Miss O
Brotherton's S-PERSON
ci-devant O
coachman O
. O
" O
You O
look O
cruel O
bad O
! O
Is O
it O
my O
tale O
as O
turns O
you O
so O
? O
or O
is O
it O
that O
you O
have O
walked O
too O
much O
and O
too O
fast O
? O
" O
" O
No O
, O
no O
, O
no O
! O
Pray O
go O
on O
! O
" O
murmured O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
making O
a O
strong O
effort O
to O
articulate O
. O
" O
' O
Tis O
the O
story O
, O
then O
? O
and O
you O
knowed O
the O
poor O
Armstrongs S-ORG
, O
beyond O
all O
doubt O
! O
" O
said O
the O
kind O
- O
hearted O
coachman O
. O
" O
Well O
then O
, O
you O
shall O
hear O
the O
end O
of O
it O
. O
When O
my O
mistress O
brought O
back O
the O
news O
of O
the O
little O
fellow's O
death O
, O
his O
poor O
mother O
, O
who O
was O
but O
a O
sickly O
, O
cripply O
sort O
of O
body O
, O
just O
broke O
her O
heart O
and O
died O
| | O
whereupon O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
took O
home O
the O
other O
boy O
, O
put O
him O
to O
school O
to O
my O
wife O
, O
and O
then O
took O
to O
teaching O
him O
herself O
, O
and O
treated O
him O
for O
all O
the O
world O
as O
if O
he O
had O
been O
her O
own O
brother O
| | O
and O
then O
she O
began O
to O
fancy O
that O
he O
wanted O
a O
doctor O
— O
" O
" O
And O
then O
, O
" O
groaned O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
suddenly O
interrupting O
him O
, O
— O
" O
and O
then O
he O
died O
! O
" O
one O
may O
say O
. O
And O
when O
was O
it O
he O
died O
? O
It's O
curious O
that O
we O
should O
never O
have O
heard O
of O
it O
. O
" O
" O
Heard O
of O
it O
? O
" O
said O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
while O
a O
sort O
of O
wild O
uncertainty O
took O
possession O
of O
his O
mind O
, O
that O
gave O
him O
the O
feeling O
of O
one O
whose O
reason O
threatened O
to O
leave O
him O
. O
" O
Heard O
it O
? O
Why O
did O
you O
want O
to O
hear O
it O
? O
Could O
you O
not O
see O
it O
, O
and O
know O
it O
, O
if O
he O
was O
living O
in O
the O
same O
house O
with O
you O
? O
" O
" O
For O
certain O
I O
could O
, O
if O
he O
had O
died O
while O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
remained O
at O
the O
park O
| | O
but O
that O
he O
did O
not O
, O
for O
I O
drove O
him O
off O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
stage O
myself O
, O
alive O
and O
well O
, O
and O
looking O
as O
beautiful O
as O
he O
always O
did O
, O
poor O
lad O
, O
for O
he O
was O
to O
be O
sure O
the O
handsomest O
- O
faced O
boy O
, O
that O
ever O
I O
looked O
upon O
. O
But O
what O
might O
have O
happened O
to O
him O
afterwards O
, O
is O
of O
course O
more O
than O
I O
can O
say O

for O
when O
the O
place O
was O
sold O
, O
and O
all O
of O
us O
paid O
off O
, O
all O
we O
heard O
was O
, O
that O
our O
dear O
young O
lady O
was O
set O
off O
to O
travel O
in O
foreign O
countries O
, O
and O
had O
left O
pensions O
to O
every O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
her O
servants O
according O
to O
their O
length O
of O
service O

know O
nothing O

to O
look O
after O

she O
got O
into O
the O
wrong O
box O

, O
about O

dead O

there O
ever O

who O
was O
it O
, O
my O
boy O

told O
you O
as O
your O
brother O
was O
dead O

" O
" O

woman O
in O

— O
one O
living O
in O
the O
house O
where O
my O
mother O
died O

told O

old O
coachman O
with O
quickness O
. O
" O
No O

she O
knew O
me O
not O
, O

Michael S-PERSON

" O
but O
she O
knew O
that O

widow O

the O
other O
eagerly O

she O
said O

widow's O

meant O
you O

lay O
my O
life O

it O

told O

would O
have O
named O
that O
of O

boy O

it O
would O
have O
always O
been O

followed O
close O

the O
news O

fact O

Michael S-PERSON
clasped O
his O
hands O
rigidly O
together O

closing O
his O
eyes O

remained O
so O
long O
motionless O
, O
that O
his O
good O
- O
natured O
companion O
became O
alarmed O
, O

laying O
his O
hand O
upon O
the O
poor O
lad's O
arm O
, O
shook O
him O
gently O
, O
as O
he O
said O
, O
" O
Any O
how O

my O
good O

a O
sheet O

natural O
enough O

my O
notion O

forth O

timely O
relief O

set O
off O
again O
by O
times O

- O
morrow O

that O
will O
bring O
you O
in O
easy O
by O
about O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
day O
, O
you O
know O
. O
" O
" O
Impossible O
! O
" O
said O
Michael S-PERSON
. O
" O
I O
owe O
you O
more O
than O
I O
am O
able O
to O
thank O
you O
for O
, O
and O
I O
would O
be O
willing O
to O
show O
my O
gratitude O
by O
following O
your O
advice O
— O
only O
, O
sir O
, O
I O
am O
quite O
sure O
I O
could O
not O
sleep O
a O
wink O
. O
And O
I O
don't O
think O
it O
would O
do O
me O
any O
good O
to O
lie O
tossing O
from O
side O
to O
side O
, O
unknowing O
, O
for O
certain O
, O
whether O
my O
own O
dear O
Teddy S-PERSON
was O
alive O
or O
dead O
! O
So O
if O
you O
please O
, O
I O
must O
set O
off O
directly O
, O
that O
I O
may O
know O
the O
best O
and O
the O
worst O
at O
once O
. O
" O
" O
I O
suppose O
at O
your O
age O
I O
should O
have O
done O
the O
same O

therefore O
I O
won't O
pretend O
to O
quarrel O
with O
you O
for O
it O

" O
replied O
the O
good O
man O

" O
but O
I O
suppose O
it O
would O
be O
just O
prudent O
to O
call O
for O
an O
ink O

" O
Parson B-PERSON
Bell E-PERSON

of O
Fairly O

are O
the O
words O
you O

they O
, O
as O
well O
as O
all O
the O

you O

spoken O

seem O
as O

my O
very O
heart O

But O
yet O
, O
before O
I O
start O
, O
I O
should O
like O
to O
use O
the O
ink O

horn O
too O
, O
that O
I O
might O
write O
a O
line O
or O
so O
to O
my O
good O
master O

I O
know O
he O
will O
be O
troubled O
in O
his O
mind O
about O
me O

I O

back O

it O

This O

sure O
to O

undertook O
to O
order O
the O
writing O

as O
well O
as O
something O
substantial O
by O
way O

supper O

declaring O
that O

tranquillity O

off O
upon O
a O

was O

against O

materials O

set O

" O
Your O
goodness O

all O
ways O

would O
make O
any O
abuse O

it O
on O
my O

heavy O

too O
heavy O

for O

commit O

you O

on O
next B-TIME
Saturday I-TIME
night E-TIME

according O
to O
my O
promise O

A O
very O
strange O
thing O
has O
happened O
to O
me O

dear O
master O

which O
may O
, O
perhaps O
, O
come O
to O
nothing O

in O
that O
case O
I O

you O

hear O
my O
story O

pity O
me O
too O
much O

anger O

if O
all O
I O
hope O
comes O

your O
generous O

rejoice O

bless O
your O

for O
bringing O

the O
knowledge O

the O
very O

joy O

ever O

" O
Having O
finished O
his O
letter O
, O

committed O
it O
to O
the O
post O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
felt O
somewhat O
more O
tranquil O
, O
and O
endeavoured O
to O
assume O
with O
his O
new O
acquaintance O
an O
air O
of O
greater O
composure O
, O
and O
self O
- O
possession O
. O
But O
his O
heart O
beat O
, O
his O
temples O
throbbed O
, O
his O
thoughts O
wandered O
, O
and O
when O
he O
and O
his O
friendly O
companion O
sat O
down O
to O
supper O
, O
the O
poor O
boy O
felt O
that O
he O
could O
almost O
as O
easily O
have O
swallowed O
the O
board O
itself O
as O
any O
portion O
of O
the O
substantial O
fare O
which O
was O
spread O
upon O
it O
. O
But O
he O
quaffed O
a O
long O
and O
refreshing O
draught O
from O
a O
pitcher O
of O
cold O
water O
, O
and O
putting O
, O
at O
the O
suggestion O
of O
the O
worthy O
coachman O
, O
a O
crust O
in O
his O
pocket O
, O
he O
sallied O
forth O
with O
the O
agitating O
consciousness O
that O
on O
the O
information O
of O
which O
he O
was O
in O
pursuit O
, O
hung O
all O
his O
earthly O
hopes O
. O
His O
new O
friend O
shook O
his O
head O
as O
he O
felt O
his O
feverish O
hand O
, O
and O
marked O
his O
heightened O
colour O
, O
and O
his O
eager O
eye O
. O
you O
at O
a O
pinch O
, O
if O
you O
should O
happen O
to O
have O
need O
of O
me O
. O
And O
here O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
Armstrong E-PERSON
, O
are O
three S-CARDINAL
sovereigns O
, O
that O
I O
give O
you O
to O
keep O
for O
two S-CARDINAL
reasons O
. O
One S-CARDINAL
is O
, O
that O
you O
may O
use O
them O
in O
case O
you O
have O
need O
. O
The O
other O
, O
that O
if O
you O
don't O
want O
them O
, O
I O
shall O
be O
sure O
to O
see O
you O
, O
when O
you O
bring O
them O
back O
, O
and O
that O
you O
will O
do O
, O
or O
I'll O
never O
trust O
a O
lad's O
face O
more O
| | O
and O
now O
good O
bye O
. O
It O
is O
but O
a O
wildish O
sort O
of O
boy's O
trick O
though O
, O
setting O
off O
this O
way O
at O
night O
, O
when O
you O
ought O
to O
be O
in O
bed O

" O
" O
The O
air O
and O
the O
walk O
will O
do O
me O
more O
good O
than O
all O
the O
beds O
in O
the O
world O

" O
replied O
Michael S-PERSON

" O
God O
bless O
you O
, O
sir O

See O
me O
you O
shall O
, O
if O
I O
continue O
to O
live O

" O
and O
so O
saying O
, O
he O
strode O
forth O
into O
the O
night O
, O
with O
a O
longing O
for O
greater O
space O
to O
breathe O
in O
, O
than O
could O
be O
found O
in O
the O
kitchen O
of O
the B-FAC
Royal I-FAC
- I-FAC
oak E-FAC
. O
The O
boy O
was O
right O
as O
to O
the O
effect O
which O
this O
bodily O
exertion O
would O
produce O
upon O
him O
. O
The O
very O
darkness O
calmed O
him O
| | O
he O
took O
his O
hat O
off O
that O
the O
cool O
air O
might O
bathe O
his O
temples O
with O
its O
dewy O
breath O
| | O
and O
though O
his O
pace O
was O
rapid O
, O
and O
scarcely O
relaxed O
for O
a O
moment O
during O
many O
miles O
, O
the O
action O
of O
his O
pulse O
became O
more O
healthy O
, O
and O
the O
aching O
of O
his O
throbbing O
temples O
passed O
away O
. O
All O
he O
now O
seemed O
to O
fear O
was O
that O
his O
imagination O
should O
cheat O
him O
into O
the O
persuasion O
that O
all O
he O
wished O
was O
true O
. O
Edward S-PERSON
! O
Fanny S-PERSON
! O
( O
for O
of O
her O
identity O
with O
Miss O
Brotherton's S-PERSON
protégée O
he O
could O
hardly O
doubt O
, O
when O
he O
remembered O
the O
history O
of O
her O
departure O
from O
the B-LOC
Deep I-LOC
Valley E-LOC
) O
— O
these O
names O
seemed O
to O
ring O
in O
his O
ears O
, O
and O
to O
be O
inscribed O
in O
starlight O
on O
the O
heavens O
as O
he O
raised O
his O
eyes O
towards O
them O
. O
And O
thus O
the O
sixteen B-QUANTITY
miles E-QUANTITY
were O
traversed O
before O
he O
had O
half O
chewed O
the O
cud O
of O
all O
the O
sweet O
thoughts O
that O
thronged O
upon O
his O
fancy O
. O
When O
he O
reached O
Fairly O
, O
it O
was O
still O
much O
too O
early O
to O
find O
any O
one O
stirring O
, O
so O
Michael S-PERSON
unceremoniously O
walked O
into O
a O
cart O
- O
shed O
, O
and O
clambering O
up O
into O
a O
vehicle O
that O
had O
the O
sweet O
savour O
of O
newly O
- O
carried O
hay O
to O
recommend O
it O
, O
he O
placed O
his O
bundle O
under O
his O
head O
, O
and O
despite O
both O
hopes O
and O
fears O
, O
fell O
into O
a O
sound O
sleep O
, O
nor O
waked O
till O
cocks O
, O
hens O
, O
cows O
, O
pigs O
, O
and O
ploughboys O
, O
all O
joined O
in O
chorus O
to O
arouse O
him O

CHAPTER O
XXVIII O
. O
AN O
IMPORTANT O
INTERVIEW O
— O
DOUBTS O
AND O
FEARS O
. O
than O
he O
felt O
conscious O
of O
being O
near O
the O
most O
important O
moment O
of O
his O
life O
. O
Again O
he O
closed O
his O
eyes O
, O
but O
not O
to O
sleep O
, O
and O
fervently O
prayed O
that O
whatever O
might O
be O
the O
tidings O
which O
awaited O
him O
, O
he O
might O
have O
strength O
to O
receive O
and O
bear O
them O
as O
he O
ought O
. O
Then O
, O
springing O
from O
his O
resting O
- O
place O
upon O
the O
ground O
, O
he O
inquired O
of O
a O
lad O
near O
him O
the O
way O
to O
Mr. O
Bell's S-PERSON
, O
and O
set O
off O
to O
follow O
the O
directions O
he O
received O
with O
no O
greater O
delay O
than O
was O
necessary O
for O
a O
short O
halt O
beside O
a O
little O
streamlet O
on O
the O
way O
, O
which O
offered O
a O
welcome O
opportunity O
of O
washing O
his O
face O
and O
hands O
before O
he O
petitioned O
for O
admission O
to O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
good O
clergyman O
, O
to O
whose O
words O
he O
looked O
forward O
with O
an O
intensity O
of O
interest O
which O
almost O
amounted O
to O
agony O
. O
Though O
it O
was O
still O
early O
, O
Mr. O
Bell S-PERSON
was O
already O
in O
his O
garden O
, O
and O
when O
the O
gate O
opened O
, O
it O
was O
himself O
who O
turned O
towards O
it O
to O
learn O
the O
errand O
of O
the O
young O
stranger O
. O
Michael S-PERSON
felt O
at O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
glance O
that O
the O
gentleman O
who O
stood O
before O
him O
was O
the O
person O
from O
whom O
he O
was O
to O
learn O
whether O
the O
brother O
he O
had O
so O
long O
mourned O
as O
dead O
was O
still O
alive O
, O
and O
he O
trembled O
so O
violently O
from O
head O
to O
foot O
that O
he O
could O
not O
articulate O
a O
word O
. O
" O
What O
ails O
you O
, O
my O
lad O
? O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Bell S-PERSON
, O
gently O
laying O
a O
hand O
upon O
his O
shoulder O
, O
and O
looking O
earnestly O
in O
his O
face O
. O
" O
You O
have O
not O
the O
look O
of O
one O
who O
has O
done O
mischief O
, O
or O
else O
I O
could O
fancy O
that O
you O
had O
some O
terrible O
tale O
to O
tell O
. O
Come O
into O
the O
house O
and O
sit O
down O
, O
my O
boy O
, O
for O
it O
is O
very O
clear O
you O
are O
not O
quite O
able O
to O
stand O
. O
" O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
still O
silent O
, O
followed O
his O
considerate O
host O
into O
the O
house O
, O
and O
thankfully O
received O
from O
his O
hands O
a O
glass O
of O
water O
, O
which O
did O
him O
good O
service O
, O
for O
in O
a B-TIME
minute E-TIME
or O
two S-CARDINAL
he O
was O
able O
to O
say O
, O
" O
I O
want O
you O
to O
tell O
me O
, O
sir O
— O
may O
God O
give O
me O
strength O
to O
hear O
your O
answer O

it O

" O
But O
notwithstanding O
Michael's S-PERSON
torturing O
eagerness O
to O
hear O
the O
answer O
, O
he O
put O
his O
hand O
before O
his O
eyes O
, O
because O
he O
had O
not O
courage O
to O

might O

it O

Mr. O

eagerly O

" O
Michael S-PERSON
sunk O
from O
his O
chair O
upon O
his O
knees O
, O
and O
lifting O
his O
clasped O
hands O
towards O
Heaven O
, O
seemed O
breathing O
thanksgivings O
for O
this O
assured O
confirmation O
of O
tidings O
which O
, O
till O
now O
, O
he O
had O
not O
dared O
to O
believe O
true O
. O
But O
, O
startled O
as O
he O
was O
, O
the O
anxiety O
, O
the O
excitement O
, O
and O
the O
fatigue O
of O
the O
preceding O
night O
and O
day O
, O
had O
been O
more O
than O
enough O
for O
him O
, O
and O
at O
the O
moment O
when O
every O
thought O
would O
have O
been O
joy O
, O
and O
every O
sensation O
delight O
, O
he O
ceased O
to O
think O
or O
feel O
at O
all O
, O
— O
the O
colour O
forsook O
his O
lips O
, O
his O
eyes O
closed O
, O
and O
, O
greatly O
to O
the O
dismay O
of O
Mr. O
Bell S-PERSON
, O
he O
sunk O
prostrate O
on O
the O
floor O
. O
Westmorland S-GPE
shepherd O
, O
lay O
extended O
on O
a O
sofa O
, O
with O
essences O
at O
his O
nose O
, O
and O
the O
opening O
of O
his O
dark O
eyes O
watched O
for O
, O
as O
tenderly O
as O
if O
he O
had O
been O
a O
delicate O
young O
lady O
. O
A O
deep O
- O
drawn O
sigh O
announced O
to O
Mr. O
Bell S-PERSON
, O
who O
stood O
by O
, O
anxiously O
watching O
him O
, O
that O
his O
remedies O
had O
been O
successful O
, O
that O
the O
boy O
so O
long O
mourned O
as O
dead O
, O
was O
really O
and O
truly O
alive O

and O
a O
very O
handsome O
, O
well O
- O
grown O
fellow O
into O
the O
bargain O
. O
" O
This O
is O
a O
strange O
history O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
as O
ever O
I O
chanced O
to O
hear O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
taking O
the O
boy's O
hand O
, O
and O
ascertaining O
that O
his O
pulse O
again O
made O
' O
healthful O
music O
. O
' O
" O
Why O
we O
have O
all O
been O
mourning O
for O
you O
as O
dead O
for O
this O
many O
a O
year O
, O
and O
now O
you O
drop O
down O
, O
as O
if O
from O
the O
clouds O
, O
and O
by O
what O
I O
can O
make O
out O
, O
have O
been O
fancying O
on O
your O
side O
that O
Edward S-PERSON
was O
dead O
too O
. O
The O
first S-ORDINAL
thing O
to O
do O
, O
must O
, O
I O
think O
, O
be O
to O
give O
you O
some O
breakfast O
, O
and O
then O
, O
if O
you O
are O
strong O
enough O
, O
you O
shall O
tell O
me O
how O
all O
this O
has O
come O
to O
pass O
. O
" O
Full O
as O
his O
heart O
was O
, O
and O
eagerly O
as O
he O
longed O
for O
the O
conversation O
in O
which O
he O
had O
so O
much O
to O
learn O
, O
as O
well O
as O
to O
tell O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
gratefully O
submitted O
to O
this O
arrangement O
, O
till O
having O
received O
from O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
deeply O
- O
interested O
Mrs. O
Bell O
herself O
the O
refreshment O
he O
so O
greatly O
needed O
, O
he O
felt O
his O
young O
strength O
return O
, O
and O
if O
he O
trembled O
as O
he O
turned O
his O
eyes O
towards O
his O
kind O
host O
, O
with O
a O
look O
that O
seemed O
to O
say O
, O
" O
Now O
, O
sir O
, O
I O
can O
talk O
to O
you O
, O
" O
it O
was O
from O
eagerness O
, O
not O
weakness O
. O
Mr. O
Bell S-PERSON
understood O
the O
appeal O
, O
and O
well O
inclined O
to O
answer O
it O
, O
said O
, O
" O
Having O
told O
you O
that O
Edward S-PERSON
is O
alive O
and O
well O
, O
my O
dear O
boy O

only O
wants O
the O
sight O
that O
I O
see O
now O
to O
make O
him O
perfectly O
happy O
, O
I O
think O
you O
ought O
to O
be O
satisfied O
, O
and O
not O
expect O
me O
to O
tell O
you O
any O
more O

my O
curiosity O
is O
gratified O
by O
hearing O
your O
own O
history O

How O
in O
theworld O
did O
it O
happen O
, O
Michael S-PERSON

that O
when O
Miss O

went O
to O
the B-LOC
Deep I-LOC
Valley I-LOC
Mills E-LOC
, O
on O
purpose O
to O
look O
for O

should O
come O
back O

you O
were O
dead O

the O
charming O
little O
girl O
she O
brought O
away O
with O
her O
had O
seen O
you O
there O
, O
and O
seemed O
to O
know O
you O
well O
? O
" O
Michael B-PERSON
Armstrong E-PERSON
told O
his O
own O
story O
more O
succinctly O
than O
I O
have O
been O
able O
to O
do O
it O
, O
and O
probably O
much O
better O
too O

for O
he O
beguiled O
Mrs. O
Bell S-PERSON
of O
many O
tears O
as O
she O
listened O
to O
him O
| | O
and O
bare O
as O
the O
sad O
narrative O
was O
of O
events O
, O
her O
husband O
also O
hung O
upon O
every O
word O
of O
it O
, O
as O
if O
, O
contrary O
to O
the O
theory O
which O
seemed O
to O
be O
pretty O
generally O
established O
in O
his O
neighbourhood O
, O
he O
thought O
the O
feelings O
and O
the O
sufferings O
of O
a O
factory O
- O
child O
might O
be O
capable O
of O
exciting O
interest O
. O
When O
the O
history O
had O
reached O
its O
conclusion O
, O
and O
Michael S-PERSON
had O
fairly O
brought O
himself O
into O
Mr. O
Bell's S-PERSON
breakfast O
- O
parlour O
, O
he O
paused O
, O
and O
with O
a O
very O
eloquent O
look O
of O
entreaty O
said O
, O
" O
Now O
, O
sir O
, O
may O
I O
not O
listen O
to O
you O
? O
" O
I O
go O
any O
further O
, O
what O
sort O
of O
a O
boy O
was O
your O
brother O
Edward S-PERSON
when O
you O
saw O
him O
last O
? O
" O
" O
Oh O
, O
sir O
! O
he O
was O
the O
dearest O
, O
kindest O
fellow O
that O
ever O
lived O
! O
" O
replied O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
his O
fine O
eyes O
beaming O
with O
tenderness O
and O
well O
- O
remembered O
love O
. O
" O
But O
what O
sort O
of O
a O
boy O
was O
he O
to O
look O
at O
? O
" O
demanded O
the O
clergyman O
. O
Michael S-PERSON
closed O
his O
eyes O
as O
if O
the O
better O
to O
contemplate O
the O
inward O
picture O
engraven O
on O
his O
memory O
. O
" O
His O
face O
was O
a O
sweet O
face O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
" O
but O
his O
dear O
limbs O
were O
crippled O
. O
He O
was O
a O
slighter O
boy O
than O
me O
, O
and O
could O
not O
stand O
the O
labour O
of O
the O
mill O

and O
I O
fear O
— O
I O
fear O
, O
" O
he O
added O
, O
shuddering O
, O
" O
that O
my O
poor O
Edward S-PERSON
must O
live O
and O
die O
a O
cripple O
. O
" O
" O
What O
is O
your O
opinion O
about O
that O
, O
my O
dear O
? O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Bell S-PERSON
, O
turning O
to O
his O
laughing O
wife O
. O
" O
Why O
, O
I O
am O
inclined O
to O
think O
that O
Michael S-PERSON
will O
have O
some O
difficulty O
in O
identifying O
his O
brother O
when O
he O
gets O
to O
him O
, O
" O
she O
replied O
. O
" O
Instead O
of O
being O
a O
cripple O
, O
" O
resumed O
Mr. O
Bell S-PERSON
, O
" O
I O
suspect O
that O
your O
brother O
is O
a O
handsomer O
fellow O
than O
you O
are O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
. O
Every O
thing O
promised O
well O
for O
it O
when O
he O
took O
leave O
of O
us O
, O
and O
since O
then O
my O
wife O
has O
had O
letters O
from O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON

which O
do O
not O
speak O

any O
falling O
off O
in O
his O
improvement O

" O
Nay S-PERSON

" O
said O
the O
lady O
, O
" O
I O
have O
had O
more O
than O
letters O

I O
show O
him O
Miss O
Brotherton's S-PERSON

George S-PERSON

" O
" O
Most O
certainly O

my O
dear O

it O
will O
save O
me O
a O
vast O
deal O

trust O
to O

Michael S-PERSON

implicitly O

to O
my O
words O

never O
was O

more O
faithful O
limner O

" O
Mrs. O
Bell S-PERSON
then O
opened O
a O
little O
portfolio O
, O
secured O
by O
a O
key O
, O
and O
drew O
thence O
a O
drawing O
in O
water O

colours O
, O
the O
composition O

finish O
of O

would O
have O
done O
no O
discredit O

a O
professional O
artist O

How O
the O
stout O
nerves O
of O
the O
young O
and O
athletic O
Michael S-PERSON
trembled O
as O
he O
received O
it O

At O
first S-ORDINAL
his O

him O

Mr. O
Bell S-PERSON

" O

again O

The O
large O
expressive O
eyes O
, O
beaming O
with O
mingled O
softness O
and O
animation O
, O
were O
directed O
to O
some O
object O
out O
of O
the O
picture O
, O
but O
at O
no O
great O
distance O

for O
the O
sweet O
smile O
that O
played O
about O
the O
mouth O
seemed O
to O
indicate O
that O
he O
was O
listening O
to O
pleasant O
words O
from O
some O
well O
- O
loved O
companion O
. O
The O
figure O
of O
the O
young O
man O
thus O
represented O
, O
was O
tall O
and O
graceful O
. O
His O
dress O
was O
the O
light O
summer O
garb O
of O
a O
southern O
climate O
— O
an O
open O
book O
was O
in O
his O
hand O
, O
his O
straw O
hat O
lay O
at O
his O
feet O
, O
beside O
which O
stood O
a O
basket O
of O
newly O
- O
gathered O
grapes O
, O
and O
a O
small O
Italian S-NORP
greyhound O
, O
its O
bright O
eye O
looking O
in O
the O
same O
direction O
as O
his O
own O
, O
completed O
the O
group O
, O
which O
spoke O
in O
every O
part O
of O
it O
a O
sort O
of O
graceful O
ease O
and O
enjoyment O
, O
that O
it O
was O
very O
pleasant O
to O
look O
upon O
. O
" O
Can O
this O
indeed O
by O
my O
Edward S-PERSON
? O
" O
said O
Michael S-PERSON
at O
length O
, O
after O
a O
long O
silent O
examination O
of O
the O
drawing O
. O
" O
How O
beautiful O
! O
— O
how O
noble O
! O
— O
how O
happy O
— O
how O
healthful O
— O
how O
intelligent O
he O
looks O
! O
Is O
it O
my O
own O
dear O
, O
pale O
, O
sickly O
brother O
? O
Can O
this O
be O
true O
? O
" O
" O
As O
true O
as O
that O
you O
stand O
there O
to O
look O
at O
it O
, O
" O
replied O
Mr. O
Bell S-PERSON
. O
" O
Is O
there O
nothing O
in O
the O
face O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
that O
recalls O
your O
brother O
to O
you O
? O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
sir O
, O
" O
he O
replied O
quickly O

" O
the O
eyes O
and O
the O
sweet O
smile O
are O
so O
like O
my O
own O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
that O
strange O
as O
it O
is O
to O
see O
him O
so O
healthy O
, O
tall O
, O
and O
graceful O
as O
he O
is O
represented O
here O
, O
and O
looking O
, O
too O
, O
so O
greatly O
like O
a O
gentleman O
, O
I O
do O
quite O
believe O
that O
this O
was O
never O
drawn O
for O
any O
one O
but O
him O

for O
never O
, O
never O
since O
I O
saw O
him O
last O
, O
have O
I O
seen O
such O
eyes O
, O
or O
such O
a O
smile O
as O
that O
. O
" O
" O
You O
are O
quite O
right O
there O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
. O
The O
face O
is O
one O
not O
easily O
forgotten O
, O
and O
I O
can O
trace O
it O
here O
, O
notwithstanding O
all O
the O
change O
of O
age O
and O
circumstance O
. O
But O
who O
do O
you O
think O
that O
slender O
girl O
may O
be O
? O
It O
seems O
a O
pity O
not O
to O
see O
her O
face O
| | O
the O
form O
, O
the O
pretty O
attitude O
, O
the O
bright O
waving O
locks O
, O
all O
plainly O
tell O
that O
it O
must O
be O
worth O
looking O
at O
. O
Can O
you O
guess O
who O
it O
is O
? O
" O
" O
I O
suppose O
it O
is O
Fanny B-PERSON
Fletcher E-PERSON
, O
" O
replied O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
colouring O
. O
" O
And O
there O
, O
too O
, O
you O
are O
quite O
right O
. O
But O
does O
it O
not O
puzzle O
you O
to O
think O
how O
all O
this O
has O
been O
brought O
about O

How O
does O
it O
happen O

you O

that O
those O

you O

a O
state O

different O
, O
should O
now O
be O
living O
as O
you O

them O
here O

looking O
as O
if O
their O
existence O
were O
made O
up O
of O
sunshine O

sweet O
air O
? O
" O
her O
fine O

foreign O

with O
two S-CARDINAL

" O
" O
You O
may O
well O
marvel O
at O
it O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
for O
it O
is O
no O
common O
act O
. O
But O
will O
you O
not O
think O
it O
something O
stranger O
still O
, O
if O
I O
declare O
, O
as O
I O
can O
do O
with O
all O
truth O

that O
you O
are O
yourself O

primal O

it O

said O
Mr. O
Bell S-PERSON

" O
You O
look O
incredulous O

yet O
so O
it O
is O

Do O
you O
remember O
the O
play O

Michael S-PERSON

" O
Sir O
Matthew's S-PERSON

cried O
Michael S-PERSON

burying O
his O
face O
in O
his O
hands O

" O
Oh O
, O
sir O

can O
I O
ever O

it O

" O
" O
It O
was O
a O
vastly O
gay O
thing O

too O

" O
returned O
Mr. O
Bell S-PERSON
, O
smiling O
, O
" O
and O
all O
the O
performers O
were O
exceedingly O
admired O

you O
do O
not O

remember O
it O

any O

pleasure O

" O
" O
Pleasure O
, O
Mr. O
Bell S-PERSON
? O
" O
returned O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
with O
something O
like O
a O
groan O
| | O
" O
I O
have O
suffered O
a O
good O
deal O
, O
considering O
how O
few O
years O
I O
had O
lived O
before O
my O
sufferings O
were O
over O

, O
excepting O
the O
coming O
home O
to O
mother's O
, O
and O
finding O
her O
and O
Teddy S-PERSON
gone O

, O
as O
they O
told O
me O
, O
dead O

both O
dead O
! O
excepting O
then O
, O
I O
never O
was O
so O
very O
, O
very O
wretched O
as O
while O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
was O
making O
me O
practise O
for O
that O
play O

" O
" O
Do O
you O
remember O
the O
very O
night O
it O
was O
acted O
, O
when O
you O
, O
and O
he O
, O
and O
Dr. O
Crockley S-PERSON
were O
in O
a O
room O
by O
yourselves O
, O
somewhere O
behind O
the O
scenes O

do O
you O
remember O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
his O
beating O
and O
abusing O
you O
because O
you O
had O
cried O
upon O
the O
stage O
? O
" O
" O
As O
well O
as O
if O
it O
had O
happened O
yesterday S-DATE
, O
" O
replied O
the O
young O
man O
. O
" O
I O
had O
to O
utter O
false O
and O
lying O
praise O
about O
him O

something O
I O
am O
sure O
there O
was O
about O
loving O
him O
as O
well O
as O
my O
dear O
mother O

That O
I O
could O
not O
bear O

and O
then O
it O
was O
that O
the O
tears O
burst O
out O
, O
though O
well O
I O
knew O
what O
I O
should O
pay O
for O
shedding O
them O
. O
" O
every O
want O
and O
every O
hardship O
were O
relieved O
from O
the B-TIME
first I-TIME
hour E-TIME
that O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
saw O
her O
— O
and O
she O
died O
with O
the O
comfort O
of O
knowing O
that O
her O
poor O
Edward S-PERSON
would O
never O
have O
to O
labour O
more O
. O
Soon O
after O
her O
death O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
took O
your O
brother O
to O
London S-GPE
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
consulting O
the O
most O
able O
surgeons O
about O
his O
lameness O
. O
Their O
science O
did O
not O
fail O
them O
| | O
for O
they O
predicted O
that O
with O
proper O
treatment O
he O
would O
outgrow O
it O
— O
and O
so O
he O
has O
, O
completely O

being O
at O
this O
time O
not O
only O
the O
graceful O
well O

made O
personage O
you O
see O
him O
represented O
there O
, O
but O
healthy O
, O
active O
, O
and O
gifted O
, O
as O
I O
hear O
, O
with O
a O
most O
rare O
intelligence O
. O
For O
reasons O
which O
it O
is O
not O
very O
difficulty O
to O
guess O
, O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
thought O
that O
she O
and O
her O
young O
protégées O
would O
find O
themselves O
better O
off O
on O
the O
continent O
than O
in O
Lancashire S-GPE

and O
from O
the O
time O
she O
first S-ORDINAL
left O
Milford B-FAC
Park E-FAC
to O
visit O
London S-GPE
, O
she O
has O
never O
returned O
to O
it O
. O
The O
place O
is O
now O
sold O
, O
and O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
has O
no O
longer O
any O
possessions O
in O
this O
neighbourhood O
. O
And O
now O
my O
dear O
boy O
, O
I O
think O
I O
have O
told O
you O
all O
, O
excepting O
the O
exact O
spot O
where O
they O
now O
are O

and O
this O
I O
cannot O
do O
, O
because O
our O
last O
letter O
from O
her O
informed O
us O
that O
they O
were O
just O
setting O
off O
upon O
a O
tour O
through O
Italy S-GPE

She O
resided O
some O
time O

, O
for O
one B-DATE
year E-DATE
, O
at O
Paris S-GPE
, O
that O
the O
young O
people O
might O
acquire O
the O
language O

but O
for O
the O
most O
part O

Germany S-GPE

been O
their O

It O
is O
there O
that O
your O
brother O
has O
received O
his O
education O
, O
and O
I O
think O
it O
very O
probable O
that O
it O
is O
there O
they O
will O
finally O
settle O

for O
it O
is O
in O
the O
far O

famed O
valley O
of O
the O
Rhingau S-GPE
that O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
has O
purchased O
a O
spacious O
mansion O
, O
large O
enough O
, O
as O
she O
tells O
me O

to O
accommodate O
half B-CARDINAL

around O
it O

and O
all O
capabilities O
for O
being O
converted O
into O
a O
delicious O
residence O
. O
" O
Here O
he O
ceased O

and O
it O
was O
several B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
before O
poor O
Michael S-PERSON
was O
capable O
of O
uttering O
a O
single O
word O

The O
mention O
of O
his O
mother O

hint O
that O
she O
had O
not O
long O
survived O
the O
hearing O
he O
was O
dead O
, O
wrung O
his O
heart O
anew O
, O
with O
grief O
as O
fresh O
as O
if O
he O
had O
lost O
her O
yesterday S-DATE

and O
spite O
of O
his O
manly O
stature O
, O
the O
tears O
flowed O
silently O
, O
but O
plenteously O
, O
down O
his O
cheeks O
. O
Yet O
, O
even O
when O
he O
had O
conquered O
this O
, O
there O
was O
something O
so O
surprising O
in O
the O
present O
situation O
of O
his O
brother O
, O
something O
, O
that O
notwithstanding O
all O
the O
fond O
yearnings O
of O
his O
own O
heart O
, O
seemed O
to O
place O
them O
so O
widely O
asunder O
, O
that O
the O
joy O
which O
Mr. O
Bell S-PERSON
looked O
for O
, O
was O
less O
obvious O
, O
than O
an O
expression O
of O
almost O
timid O
embarrassment O
, O
as O
he O
said O
, O
" O
Alas O

sir O
! O
what O
shall O
I O
seem O
like O
amongst O
them O

my O

of O
his O
learning O

I O

my O
best O

truly O
my O
only O
education O
has O
been O
looking O
at O
nature O
from O
the O
mountain's O
side O

I O
kept O
sheep O

all O
my O

of O
it O

I O
doubt O

have O
preserved O

" O
Mrs. O

" O
Michael's S-PERSON
hand O
trembled O
as O
he O
took O
the O
letter O
, O
and O
silently O
obeying O
the O
instructions O
he O
received O
, O
he O
walked O
out O
to O
an O
embowered O
spot O
where O
he O
could O
not O
be O
seen O
from O
the O
house O
, O
and O
seating O
himself O
on O
a O
garden O
- O
bench O
perused O
the O
following O
letter O
with O
a O
mixture O
of O
trepidation O
and O
eagerness O
which O
may O
easily O
be O
imagined O
: O
" O
Have O
you O
thought O
it O
long O
since O
last O
you O
heard O
from O
me O
, O
dear O
friends O
? O
I O
hope O
you O
have O
, O
for O
it O
has O
seemed O
very O
long O
to O
me O
since O
last O
I O
wrote O
to O
you O
. O
But O
what O
a O
thief O
of O
time O
is O
occupation O
! O
I O
have O
been O
so O
very O
busy O
in O
drawing O
plans O
for O
the O
repairing O
and O
beautifying O
my O
old O
castle O
— O
you O
would O
certainly O
call O
it O
a O
castle O
in O
England S-GPE
— O
and O
so O
constantly O
called O
upon O
by O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
to O
give O
my O
approval O
to O
his O
carte O
du O
voyage O
for O
our O
Italian S-NORP
tour O
, O
and O
by O
Fanny S-PERSON
, O
to O
sanction O
her O
plans O
for O
our O
future O
flower O
- O
garden O
, O
and O
by O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
to O
settle O
some O
point O
of O
enormous O
difficulty O
respecting O
the O
packing O
up O
of O
the O
things O
to O
be O
left O
, O
and O
the O
things O
to O
be O
taken O
, O
that O
though O
day O
by O
day O
I O
have O
told O
myself O
, O
for O
at B-DATE
least I-DATE
a I-DATE
month E-DATE
past O
, O
that O
I O
was O
behaving O
most O
abominably O
in O
not O
writing O
, O
I O
have O
never O
before O
found O
a O
leisure O
hour O
to O
set O
about O
it O
. O
But O
if O
I O
have O
not O
written O
, O
I O
have O
drawn O
for O
you O
— O
witness O
the O
view O
from O
my O
beautiful O
terrace O
which O
I O
shall O
send O
with O
this O
letter O
. O
I O
wish O
I O
could O
have O
put O
my O
own O
phiz O
in O
it O
to O
show O
you O
how O
healthy O
and O
well O
I O
look O
| | O
but O
unfortunately O
, O
you O
know O
, O
there O
is O
no O
point O
of O
sight O
from O
which O
an O
artist O
can O
catch O
a O
peep O
at O
himself O
without O
the O
aid O
of O
a O
looking O
- O
glass O
, O
and O
though O
I O
pretty O
nearly O
live O
upon O
my O
terrace O
, O
I O
have O
not O
yet O
taken O
either O
to O
sleeping O
or O
dressing O
there O
, O
so O
no O
mirror O
was O
at O
hand O
. O
But O
instead O
of O
myself O
I O
have O
given O
you O
Edward S-PERSON
| | O
sometimes O
I O
do O
feel O
a O
little O
glorious O
as O
I O
look O
at O
him O
, O
and O
remember O
the O
delicate O
pale O
face O
and O
feeble O
limbs O
that O
greeted O
my O
first S-ORDINAL
sight O
of O
him O
in O
Hoxley B-FAC
- I-FAC
lane E-FAC
. O
He O
is O
now O
— O
but O
you O
will O
laugh O
at O
me O
if O
I O
attempt O
to O
describe O
him O
in O
words O
— O
the O
sketch O
I O
send O
is O
no O
bad O
likeness O
, O
and O
may O
give O
you O
a O
tolerably O
correct O
idea O
of O
the O
alteration O
that O
has O
taken O
place O
. O
As O
to O
my O
sweet O
Fanny S-PERSON
, O
though O
the O
attempt O
would O
have O
been O
a O
bold O
one O
, O
I O
meant O
to O
have O
given O
you O
a O
likeness O
of O
her O
too O
, O
but O
her O
attitude O
was O
so O
picturesquely O
pretty O
as O
she O
stood O
, O
unconscious O
of O
what O
I O
was O
about O
, O
that O
I O
contented O
myself O
with O
the O
back O
of O
her O
curly O
head O
— O
you O
shall O
have O
her O
face O
another O
time O
. O
my O
having O
advanced O
in O
the O
precious O
labour O
of O
making O
these O
two S-CARDINAL
beloved O
beings O
happier O
. O
Were O
they O
merely O
ordinary O
young O
people O
, O
with O
average O
hearts O
and O
average O
capacities O
, O
I O
should O
still O
bless O
Heaven O
with O
a O
grateful O
heart O
, O
for O
having O
permitted O
me O
to O
be O
the O
means O
of O
changing O
their O
condition O
, O
from O
one O
of O
great O
suffering O
to O
a O
life O
of O
innocent O
enjoyment O
. O
But O
as O
it O
is O
, O
I O
know O
not O
how O
to O
be O
thankful O
enough O
! O
" O
It O
seems O
to O
me O
, O
dear O
friends O
, O
however O
much O
I O
increase O
my O
acquaintance O
with O
other O
human O
beings O
, O
that O
Edward S-PERSON
and O
Fanny S-PERSON
are O
the O
noblest O
creatures O
in O
the O
world O
. O
Is O
it O
that O
suffering O
, O
being O
of O
necessity O
a O
part O
of O
our O
earthly O
nature O
, O
we O
cannot O
arrive O
at O
the O
perfect O
development O
of O
all O
our O
faculties O
without O
it O
? O
Where O
it O
arrives O
in O
later O
life O
, O
perhaps O
, O
the O
effect O
, O
though O
inwardly O
healthful O
, O
may O
not O
show O
fruits O
so O
beautiful O
. O
There O
is O
in O
the O
minds O
of O
both O
of O
them O
, O
a O
brightness O
of O
intelligence O
, O
and O
a O
delicious O
calm O
of O
temper O
that O
I O
have O
never O
met O
elsewhere O
. O
It O
is O
as O
if O
a O
heavy O
weight O
that O
had O
been O
painfully O
crushing O
them O
, O
was O
suddenly O
removed O
, O
causing O
all O
the O
ordinary O
sensations O
of O
human O
existence O
to O
be O
felt O
as O
a O
luxury O
. O
Young O
as O
they O
are O
, O
they O
are O
full O
of O
instruction O
, O
right O
thinking O
, O
pure O
feeling O
, O
and O
a O
firmness O
of O
integrity O
which O
it O
is O
the O
best O
joy O
of O
my O
life O
to O
contemplate O
— O
and O
all O
this O
built O
on O
so O
firm O
a O
foundation O
of O
religious O
principle O
, O
that O
I O
can O
have O
no O
fears O
for O
its O
endurance O
. O
After O
this O
, O
it O
would O
be O
very O
weak O
and O
womanish O
folly O
to O
dwell O
much O
on O
their O
personal O
advantages O
, O
or O
even O
on O
the O
peculiar O
charm O
of O
their O
manners O
and O
conversation O
— O
yet O
they O
are O
gifts O
which O
bring O
a O
charm O
, O
to O
which O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
be O
quite O
insensible O
. O
" O
Is O
it O
not O
strange O
, O
dear O
friends O
, O
that O
being O
such O
as O
I O
describe O
them O
, O
and O
having O
passed O
so O
large O
a O
portion O
of O
their O
lives O
together O
in O
the O
mutual O
contemplation O
of O
each O
other's O
excellence O
, O
is O
it O
not O
strange O
that O
they O
should O
not O
by O
this O
time O
be O
lovers O
, O
instead O
of O
friends O
? O
Yet O
such O
is O
not O
the O
case O
. O
That O
they O
love O
each O
other O
sincerely O
is O
most O
true O
, O
and O
I O
could O
give O
a B-CARDINAL
thousand E-CARDINAL
proofs O
that O
either O
would O
at O
all O
times O
gladly O
renounce O
amusement O
or O
pleasure O
of O
any O
kind O
, O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
the O
other O
| | O
but O
they O
are O
not O
in O
love O
. O
If O
I O
did O
not O
believe O
it O
impossible O
, O
considering O
the O
age O
of O
the O
parties O
when O
they O
parted O
, O
I O
should O
think O
that O
Fanny's S-PERSON
little O
heart O
had O
been O
buried O
in O
the O
grave O
of O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
the O
poor O
little O
fellow O
, O
whose O
early O
sufferings O
under O
the O
tender O
patronage O
of O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
, O
first S-ORDINAL
roused O
my O
sleepy O
existence O
into O
action O
. O
She O
cannot O
yet O
hear O
his O
name O
mentioned O
, O
without O
betraying O
a O
degree O
of O
emotion O
that O
it O
is O
painful O
to O
witness O
| | O
and O
when O
, O
as O
sometimes O
happens O
, O
Edward S-PERSON
is O
taken O
for O
her O
brother O
, O
it O
seems O
to O
delight O
her O
. O
' O
Yes O
, O
yes O
, O
indeed O
he O
is O
my O
brother O
! O
I O
love O
him O
as O
such O
| | O
and O
if O
you O
ask O
him O
, O
he O
will O
tell O
you O
that O
I O
am O
to O
him O
a O
dear O
and O
loving O
sister O
, O
' O
I O
have O
heard O
her O
say O
, O
and O
if O
Edward S-PERSON
had O
been O
asked O
, O
I O
do O
believe O
he O
would O
have O
answered O
, O
and O
truly O
too O
, O
in O
the O
same O
strain O
. O
looked O
at O
with O
indifference O
. O
Yet O
, O
sometimes O
I O
am O
puzzled O
about O
Edward S-PERSON
! O
I O
think O
he O
is O
less O
gay O
and O
joyous O
than O
he O
used O
to O
be O
. O
At O
any O
time O
, O
indeed O
, O
the O
name O
of O
Michael S-PERSON
has O
ever O
been O
sufficient O
to O
bring O
an O
expression O
of O
profound O
and O
hopeless O
sorrow O
upon O
his O
fine O
countenance O
, O
which O
it O
wrings O
my O
heart O
to O
see O
| | O
for O
, O
alas O
! O
how O
vain O
must O
be O
all O
my O
affection O
, O
all O
sisterly O
love O
, O
to O
help O
him O
there O
! O
But O
, O
incontestably O
of O
late O
, O
his O
spirits O
have O
been O
less O
gay O
than O
formerly O
. O
This O
, O
to O
tell O
you O
the O
truth O
, O
is O
the O
only O
drawback O
to O
the O
happiness O
I O
enjoy O
. O
Could O
Fanny S-PERSON
and O
Edward S-PERSON
learn O
to O
forget O
poor O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
I O
should O
hardly O
have O
a O
wish O
left O
| | O
but O
I O
have O
little O
hope O
of O
this O
— O
his O
memory O
, O
I O
truly O
believe O
is O
too O
deeply O
engraven O
on O
their O
hearts O
, O
for O
any O
subsequent O
events O
to O
efface O
it O
. O
Sometimes O
, O
when O
I O
meditate O
on O
this O
sadly O
- O
enduring O
sorrow O
, O
I O
fancy O
that O
I O
should O
rejoice O
if O
they O
were O
both O
of O
them O
to O
fall O
in O
love O
, O
as O
a O
cure O
for O
it O
. O
But O
, O
alas O
! O
whenever O
that O
happens O
, O
what O
a O
breaking O
up O
of O
happiness O
it O
will O
be O
! O
for O
I O
can O
hardly O
hope O
to O
find O
a O
continental O
wife O
or O
husband O
for O
my O
adopted O
children O
, O
sufficiently O
English S-LANGUAGE
in O
habits O

character O
, O
to O
permit O
my O
inviting O
them O
to O
make O
a O
part O
of O
my O
family O
. O
Yet O
marry O
abroad O
they O
must O
, O
I O
think O
, O
if O
they O
marry O
at O
all O
— O
for O
I O
will O
never O
by O
my O
own O
free O
will O
expose O
them O
to O
the O
mortification O
likely O
to O
ensue O
upon O
such O
an O
explanation O
respecting O
their O
origin O
, O
as O
must O
be O
the O
consequence O
of O
any O
matrimonial O
negotiation O
in O
England S-GPE

On O
the O
continent O

the O
ample O
fortunes O
they O
will O
possess O
, O
with O
their O
good O
education O

great O
natural O
advantages O

will O
suffice O
to O
make O
them O
very O
desirable O
alliances O
to O
almost O
any O
one O

these O
are O
anxieties O

they O
must O
come O
upon O
me O

but O
there O
were O
traces O
of O
very O
strong O
emotion O
on O
his O
countenance O
, O
and O
his O
hand O
trembled O
as O
he O
stretched O
it O
forth O
to O
receive O
that O
which O
was O
kindly O
extended O

alone O

the O

I O
can O
hardly O
tell O
you O

the O
idea O
that O

again O
, O
a O
sort O
of O
doubt O

Michael S-PERSON

Mr. O

somewhat O
reproachfully O

Michael S-PERSON

his O
paleness O

changed O

sir O

I O
cannot O
doubt O

out O

her O

from O
the O

it O

advice O
she O
gave O
to O
your O
mother O
about O
signing O
your O

I O
fancy O
that O
letting O
her O
know O
that O
you O

consequence O
of O
his O

himself O

greater O
quantity O

, O
in O
short O
, O
that O
it O
is O
rather O
a O
nice O
question O

surely O

To O
describe O
Michael B-PERSON
Armstrong's E-PERSON
feeling O
as O
he O
took O
his O
solitary O
way O
along O
what O
seemed O
to O
him O
the O
most O
unfrequented O
fields O
he O
could O
find O
, O
would O
be O
both O
a O
difficult O
and O
an O
unnecessary O
task O
. O
That O
his O
heart O
swelled O
with O
thankfulness O
and O
joy O
cannot O
be O
doubted O
| | O
yet O
there O
was O
a O
vagueness O
and O
uncertainty O
as O
to O
what O
he O
ought O
immediately O
to O
do O
, O
which O
made O
him O
anxious O
and O
sad O
, O
even O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
hope O
and O
joy O
. O
The O
small O
sum O
he O
had O
been O
able O
to O
save O
from O
his O
wages O
had O
been O
spent O
, O
or O
very O
nearly O
so O
, O
since O
he O
set O
out O
upon O
his O
eventful O
expedition O
. O
He O
had O
already O
accepted O
a O
loan O
from O
the O
friendly O
old O
coachman O
of O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
, O
and O
he O
shrunk O
from O
the O
idea O
of O
contracting O
more O
debts O
, O
while O
unable O
to O
say O
with O
certainty O
when O
they O
should O
be O
paid O
. O
How O
then O
was O
he O
to O
reach O
his O
brother O
in O
his O
happy O
distant O
home O
? O
And O
where O
and O
how O
was O
he O
to O
pass O
the O
anxious O
interval O
that O
must O
of O
necessity O
intervene O
before O
he O
could O
even O
know O
to O
what O
point O
he O
should O
direct O
his O
pilgrim O
steps O
, O
even O
had O
he O
the O
means O
of O
setting O
forth O
? O
inquired O
the O
distance O
to O
Dowling B-FAC
Lodge E-FAC
, O
and O
finding O
it O
was O
greater O
than O
he O
could O
traverse O
on O
foot O
with O
any O
hope O
of O
returning O
in O
decent O
time O
to O
occupy O
his O
newly O
- O
taken O
lodging O
, O
he O
resolved O
to O
wait O
till O
the B-TIME
following I-TIME
morning E-TIME
, O
when O
, O
by O
setting O
off O
at O
daybreak O
, O
he O
might O
be O
able O
to O
make O
his O
visit O
to O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
and O
perhaps O
report O
the O
result O
of O
it O
to O
Mr. O
Bell S-PERSON
, O
before O
he O
slept O
. O
His O
mind O
had O
too O
much O
on O
which O
to O
employ O
itself O
for O
him O
to O
feel O
the O
afternoon O
a O
long O
one O
: O
an O
orchard O
close O
behind O
the O
little O
inn O
, O
afforded O
him O
shade O
and O
soft O
turf O
whereon O
to O
sit O
or O
lie O
, O
or O
to O
pace O
backwards O
and O
forwards O
, O
with O
unequal O
steps O
, O
as O
he O
meditated O
on O
the O
chances O
for O
and O
against O
his O
ever O
being O
one O
in O
the O
happy O
, O
thrice O
happy O
party O
described O
by O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
. O
Nor O
had O
he O
wearied O
of O
these O
exciting O
, O
but O
most O
anxious O
thoughts O
, O
when O
the O
moon O
, O
and O
the O
stars O
, O
and O
the O
heavy O
dew O
warned O
him O
at O
length O
that O
the O
day O
was O
gone O
, O
and O
night O
come O
. O
And O
then O
he O
remembered O
that O
, O
in O
order O
to O
follow O
Mr. O
Bell's S-PERSON
advice O
, O
he O
must O
prepare O
himself O
with O
a O
letter O
to O
Miss O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
which O
it O
would O
be O
necessary O
to O
write O
before O
he O
went O
to O
bed O
. O
Fortunately O
his O
hotel O
was O
able O
to O
furnish O
the O
needful O
implements O
, O
and O
after O
a O
little O
reflection O
, O
he O
penned O
the O
following O
note O
: O
" O
A O
poor O
lad O
, O
to O
whom O
Miss O
Martha B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
once O
showed O
much O
charitable O
kindness O
, O
is O
now O
waiting O
at O
the O
park O
- O
gates O
, O
to O
know O
if O
he O
may O
pay O
his O
duty O
to O
her O
. O
He O
takes O
the O
freedom O
of O
asking O
for O
this O
favour O
, O
because O
he O
has O
been O
told O
that O
she O
would O
be O
pleased O
to O
hear O
he O
was O
alive O
and O
well O
. O
" O
Having O
directed O
this O
to O
Miss O
Martha B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
, O
and O
sealed O
it O
in O
the O
best O
manner O
he O
could O
, O
he O
retired O
to O
his O
little O
bed O
in O
a O
state O
of O
mind O
that O
hovered O
between O
inexpressible O
felicity O
, O
and O
anxiety O
that O
he O
was O
hardly O
able O
to O
bear O
. O
He O
was O
afoot O
in O
time O
to O
hear O
the O
lark's O
first S-ORDINAL
overture O
on O
the B-TIME
following I-TIME
morning E-TIME
: O
and O
his O
spirits O
, O
cheered O
by O
the O
bracing O
influence O
of O
the O
delicious O
hour O
, O
and O
by O
the O
sound O
sleep O
which O
had O
preceded O
it O
, O
enabled O
him O
to O
breakfast O
on O
a O
slice O
of O
brown O
bread O
, O
bespoken O
the O
night O
before O
, O
and O
laid O
ready O
for O
him O
, O
with O
a O
draught O
of O
icy O
- O
cold O
water O
from O
a O
neighbouring O
well O
, O
without O
any O
mixture O
of O
melancholy O
, O
though O
he O
thought O
the O
while O
of O
all O
the O
dangers O
and O
difficulties O
he O
might O
have O
to O
encounter O
ere O
he O
stood O
beside O
his O
Edward S-PERSON
on O
the O
beautiful O
terrace O
to O
which O
his O
dreams O
had O
transported O
him O
so O
easily O
. O
Michael S-PERSON
was O
a O
stout O
walker O
, O
and O
had O
reached O
the O
well O
- O
remembered O
precincts O
of O
Dowling B-FAC
Lodge E-FAC
soon O
after O
the O
earliest O
servants O
were O
stirring O
. O
He O
had O
made O
up O
his O
mind O
to O
be O
the O
bearer O
of O
his O
own O
letter O
, O
and O
accordingly O
, O
having O
shown O
the O
address O
to O
the O
woman O
at O
the O
lodge O
as O
a O
reason O
for O
being O
permitted O
to O
enter O
, O
he O
approached O
the O
stately O
mansion O
by O
the O
road O
which O
led O
to O
the O
offices O
, O
and O
intrusting O
his O
epistle O
to O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
female O
he O
encountered O
, O
requested O
her O
to O
deliver O
it O
to O
Miss O
Martha S-PERSON
without O
delay O
. O
" O
Why O
she O
bean't O
up O
yet O
, O
" O
said O
the O
girl O
, O
looking O
at O
him O
, O
however O
, O
with O
the O
good O
- O
humoured O
smile O
with O
which O
light O
- O
hearted O
young O
damsels O
are O
wont O
to O
greet O
such O
very O
handsome O
lads O
as O
our O
Michael S-PERSON

" O
But O
perhaps O
you O
will O
be O
so O
good O
as O
to O
let O
her O
have O
it O
as O
soon O
as O
she O
is O
awake O

he O
replied O

returning O
the O
smile O

the O
girl O
, O
" O
for O
her O
cough O
often O
wakes O

you O

up O

down O

out O
early O

" O

just O
what O

the O

" O
" O
And O
does O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
rise O
early O
now O
? O
" O
demanded O
Michael S-PERSON
with O
some O
anxiety O
. O
" O
He O
! O
— O
not O
he O
! O
He O
eats O
and O
sleeps O
like O
a O
pig O
, O
they O
say O

but O
he O
is O
grumpier O
than O
ever O
he O
was O
, O
both O
to O
men O
and O
maids O
too O
, O
since O
he O
married O
the O
new O
lady O

I O
wonder O
as O
I O
never O
happened O
to O
see O
you O
before O

as O
you O
seem O
to O
know O

all O
so O
well O

" O
" O
It O
is O
several B-DATE
years E-DATE
since O
I O
was O
last O
here O
, O
" O
returned O
Michael S-PERSON
| | O
" O
but O
run O
up O
stairs O
with O
it O
, O
there's O
a O
dear O
girl O
, O
will O
you O
? O
because O
I O
want O
to O
get O
my O
answer O

be O
off O

" O
" O
You O
had O
better O
stop O
here O
till O
I O
come O
down O
again O
, O
" O
replied O
his O
good O
- O
natured O
messenger O
, O
" O
instead O
of O
walking O
up O
and O
down O
the O
road O
, O
without O
knowing O
whether O
there's O
an O
answer O
or O
no O
— O
sit O
down O
in O
the O
kitchen O
, O
and O
I'll O
be O
back O
in O
no O
time O
. O
" O
And O
into O
the O
kitchen O
he O
went O
— O
the O
selfsame O
kitchen O
which O
just B-DATE
eight I-DATE
years I-DATE
before E-DATE
had O
been O
the O
scene O
of O
his O
painful O
examination O
by O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling's E-PERSON
servants O
. O
' O
He O
remembered O
the O
room O
perfectly O
| | O
could O
have O
pointed O
out O
the O
exact O
spot O
where O
the O
awful O
housekeeper O
sat O
, O
and O
the O
place O
where O
he O
had O
himself O
stood O
, O
with O
no O
better O
champion O
to O
sustain O
his O
courage O
than O
the O
greasy O
kitchen O
- O
maid O
, O
whose O
pitying O
broad O
face O
, O
bent O
over O
him O
, O
he O
recollected O
as O
perfectly O
as O
if O
it O
had O
beamed O
upon O
him O
but O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
before E-DATE
. O
He O
was O
still O
deeply O
revolving O
these O
interesting O
reminiscences O
, O
and O
the O
strange O
contrast O
they O
offered O
to O
his O
present O
hopes O
, O
when O
his O
envoy O
returned O
— O
" O
Miss O
Martha S-PERSON
wants O
to O
know O
your O
name O
, O
young O
man O
, O
" O
she O
said O
, O
" O
but O
she O
is O
getting O
up O
, O
and O
will O
be O
walking O
in O
the O
park O
as O
usual O
, O
she O
says O
, O
presently O
, O
so O
it O
is O
likely O
enough O
that O
she O
will O
give O
you O
the O
answer O
herself O
. O
" O
" O
Very O
well O
, O
" O
replied O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
perfectly O
satisfied O
— O
" O
good O
morning O
! O
— O
I O
am O
very O
much O
obliged O
to O
you O
. O
" O
" O
But O
you O
haven't O
told O
me O
your O
name O
, O
and O
Miss O
Martha S-PERSON
says O
that O
she O
should O
like O
to O
know O
it O
. O
" O
" O
My O
name O
isn't O
one O
that O
would O
make O
any O
difference O
, O
" O
he O
replied O
, O
" O
so O
I O
won't O
trouble O
you O
to O
go O
up O
again O
about O
that O
— O
good O
bye O
! O
" O
And O
without O
waiting O
for O
any O
further O
discussion O
, O
he O
walked O
off O
, O
exceedingly O
well O
pleased O
at O
having O
arranged O
the O
wished O
for O
tête O
- O
à O
- O
tête O
so O
satisfactorily O
. O
The O
noble O
dimensions O
of O
the O
park O
enabled O
Michael S-PERSON
to O
select O
a O
space O
amply O
sufficient O
for O
his O
promenade O
which O
was O
neither O
within O
sight O
of O
the O
mansion O
nor O
the O
lodge O
, O
and O
ere O
he O
had O
made O
many O
turns O
upon O
it O
, O
he O
perceived O
the O
lady O
he O
wished O
to O
see O
, O
approaching O
him O
. O
morning S-TIME
none O
other O
was O
at O
all O
likely O
to O
be O
there O
| | O
but O
she O
was O
too O
much O
altered O
for O
him O
to O
recognise O
her O
in O
any O
degree O
. O
He O
thought O
she O
was O
taller O
than O
he O
had O
expected O
to O
see O
her O
, O
but O
at O
any O
rate O
she O
was O
greatly O
thinner O
, O
and O
so O
delicately O
pale O
, O
that O
her O
appearance O
was O
rather O
a O
contrast O
, O
than O
a O
resemblance O
to O
what O
he O
had O
expected O
to O
meet O
. O
She O
was O
already O
near O
him O
when O
he O
turned O
upon O
the O
path O
, O
and O
met O
her O
. O
He O
stopped O
, O
took O
off O
his O
hat O
, O
and O
bowed O
respectfully O
. O
" O
You O
are O
Miss O
Martha B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
, O
ma'am O
? O
" O
he O
said O
interrogatively O
. O
" O
Yes O
, O
" O
replied O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
" O
that O
is O
my O
name O

when O
did O
I O
see O
you O

I O
do O
not O
know O

" O
" O
It O
is O
a O
great O
many O
years O
, O
Miss O
Martha S-PERSON
— O
but O
I O
can O
never O
forget O
your O
kindness O
. O
" O
The O
pale O
cheek O
of O
Martha S-PERSON
was O
tinted O
with O
a O
vivid O
blush O
, O
as O
she O
exclaimed O
, O
" O
If O
it O
were O
possible O
— O
if O
I O
did O
not O
know O
that O

dead O

this O
is O
nonsense O

" O
she O
added O
, O
recovering O
her O
composure O
. O
" O
I O
quite O
forget O
your O
person O
, O
young O
man O

she O
continued O
, O
after O
a O
pause O
: O
" O

I O
have O
ever O
done O
you O
any O
service O

" O

Michael S-PERSON

" O
I O
am O
afraid O

startle O
you O

I O
do O
not O

I O
think O
it O
came O
into O
your O
head O
just O
now O

only O
you O
stopped O
short O

in O
an O
agitated O
voice O
. O
" O

Michael S-PERSON
, O
greatly O
affected O
by O
her O
look O
of O
ill O

health O

by O
the O
agitation O
she O
displayed O

trickling O
fast O
down O
her O
pale O
cheeks O

expression O
of O
pleasure O
, O
" O
my O
dear O
Michael B-PERSON
Armstrong E-PERSON
! O
your O
coming O
here O
is O
certainly O
the O
greatest O
blessing O
that O
Heaven O
could O
have O
sent O
me O
. O
I O
cannot O
tell O
you O
, O
and O
you O
can O
never O
know O
, O
all O
I O
have O
suffered O
from O
believing O
you O
were O
dead O
, O
and O
from O
knowing O
that O
I O
had O
been O
the O
cause O
of O
great O
and O
terrible O
suffering O
to O
you O
. O
And O
that O
, O
too O
, O
wholly O
owing O
to O
the O
trust O
which O
you O
, O
and O
your O
poor O
mother O
reposed O
in O
me O
! O
May O
you O
never O
, O
my O
dear O
boy O
, O
know O
what O
it O
is O
to O
have O
a O
conscience O
burdened O
as O
mine O
has O
been O
. O
Be O
very O
sure O
that O
it O
is O
worse O
than O
any O
thing O
you O
could O
have O
suffered O
at O
the B-LOC
Deep I-LOC
Valley E-LOC
, O
Michael S-PERSON
! O
When O
you O
see O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton E-PERSON
, O
tell O
her O
that O
I O
owned O
this O
to O
you O
— O
and O
perhaps O
she O
may O
think O
, O
at O
last O
, O
that O
she O
judged O
me O
rather O
more O
harshly O
than O
I O
deserved O
. O
" O
" O
If O
she O
judged O
you O
harshly O
at O
all O
, O
she O
was O
very O
wrong O
, O
" O
replied O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
warmly O
. O
" O
People O
should O
know O
, O
before O
they O
judge O
. O
Nobody O
who O
really O
knew O
you O
, O
could O
judge O
you O
harshly O
. O
" O
" O
I O
had O
rather O
that O
kind O
sentence O
came O
from O
your O
lips O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
than O
from O
those O
of O
any O
other O
human O
being O
. O
If O
you O
can O
say O
it O
, O
and O
mean O
it O
too O
, O
as O
I O
am O
sure O
you O
do O
, O
who O
is O
there O
living O
that O
can O
have O
a O
right O
to O
say O
the O
contrary O
? O
Yet O
this O
is O
not O
my O
only O
pleasure O
— O
I O
happen O
to O
have O
the O
power O
— O
and O
I O
bless O
my O
poor O
father O
for O
it O
— O
of O
making O
some O
little O
atonement O
for O
the O
years O
of O
suffering O
that O
I O
so O
unwittingly O
caused O
you O
. O
From O
the O
day O
we O
were O
each O
of O
us O
fifteen S-DATE
, O
we O
have O
received O
an O
allowance O
of O
sixty B-QUANTITY
pounds E-QUANTITY
a O
year O
for O
dress O
, O
and O
though O
I O
really O
never O
wanted O
one B-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
half E-CARDINAL
so O
much O
as O
my O
sisters O
, O
my O
father O
, O
who O
has O
ever O
been O
a O
kind O
father O
to O
me O
, O
has O
always O
insisted O
upon O
my O
having O
the O
same O
, O
and O
at O
the O
marriage O
of O
my O
two S-CARDINAL
elder O
sisters O
, O
he O
gave O
me O
a B-QUANTITY
hundred I-QUANTITY
pounds E-QUANTITY
each O
time O
, O
that O
I O
might O
be O
smart O

But O
I O
have O
no O
taste O
for O
finery O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
it O
always O
made O
me O
melancholy O

so O
I O
am O
very O
rich O
— O
I O
really O
do O
not O
know O
how O
rich O
, O
for O
I O
have O
always O
kept O
on O
laying O
the O
bank O
- O
notes O
that O
I O
did O
not O
want O
in O
a O
drawer O
, O
and O
I O
have O
never O
counted O
them O
. O
Think O
if O
it O
will O
not O
be O
a O
pleasure O
for O
me O
now O
to O
open O
that O
drawer O
, O
and O
give O
you O
all O
that O
is O
in O
it O
? O
Oh O
! O
with O
what O
different O
feelings O
shall O
I O
go O
to O
bed O

night O
from O
any O
I O
have O
felt O
for O
years S-DATE

I O
am O
sure O
there O
must O
be O
enough O
to O
take O
you O
to O
Italy S-GPE

wherever O
else O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
may O

to O
set O
you O
up O
in O
some O
little O
business O
into O
the O
bargain O

Wait O
here O
only B-TIME
ten I-TIME
minutes E-TIME
, O
my O
dear O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
and O
I O
will O
return O
with O
my O
treasure O
— O
a O
real O
treasure O
now O
, O
and O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
that O
I O
ever O
thought O
it O
so O
! O
" O
Martha S-PERSON
had O
risen O
from O
her O
seat O
as O
she O
spoke O
, O
and O
literally O
before O
Michael S-PERSON
could O
recover O
from O
his O
atonishment O
sufficiently O
to O
answer O
her O
, O
she O
was O
already O
at O
some O
distance O
from O
him O
. O
He O
had O
by O
no O
means O
settled O
to O
his O
satisfaction O
the O
question O
of O
whether O
he O
ought O
, O
or O
ought O
not O
, O
to O
strip O
the O
generous O
Martha S-PERSON
of O
her O
little O
hoard O
when O
she O
again O
appeared O
. O
But O
she O
looked O
hurried O
and O
out O
of O
breath O
. O
" O
For O
pity's O
sake O
let O
me O
not O
be O
again O
plunged O
in O
all O
the O
misery O
of O
self O
- O
reproach O
from O
which O
I O
have O
so O
recently O
escaped O
. O
Take O
this O
parcel O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
! O
Nay O
, O
never O
stay O
to O
count O
them O
! O
My O
father O
has O
left O
his O
room O
— O
may O
have O
inquired O
for O
me O
— O
and O
even O
now O
be O
following O
me O

Bless O
you O

Bless O
you O
! O
Go O
, O
go O
, O
for O
goodness O

leave O
the O
country O
as O
quickly O
as O
possible O
. O
" O
With O
these O
words O
she O
turned O
from O
him O
, O
and O
with O
a O
step O
too O
rapid O
for O
her O
state O
of O
health O
, O
and O
plainly O
showing O
her O
extreme O
anxiety O
, O
she O
hastily O
retreated O
towards O
the O
house O
. O
Though O
after O
hearing O
Mr. O
Bell's S-PERSON
decided O
opinion O
that O
no O
further O
danger O
was O
to O
be O
feared O
from O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
, O
Michael S-PERSON
would O
himself O
have O
felt O
not O
the O
least O
desire O
to O
run O
away O
from O
him O
, O
yet O
it O
was O
impossible O
not O
to O
perceive O
that O
Martha S-PERSON
was O
of O
a O
different O
mind O
, O
and O
that O
for O
some O
reason O
or O
other O
she O
was O
exceedingly O
anxious O
that O
he O
should O
not O
remain O
near O
Dowling B-FAC
Lodge E-FAC
, O
or O
, O
in O
other O
words O
, O
within O
her O
father's O
reach O
. O
Whether O
she O
were O
right O
, O
or O
wrong O
, O
in O
fancying O
that O
it O
was O
necessary O
for O
his O
safety O
that O
he O
should O
keep O
out O
of O
the O
way O
, O
he O
felt O
that O
it O
would O
be O
cruel O
to O
oppose O
her O
| | O
and O
with O
the O
unexamined O
roll O
of O
bank O
- O
notes O
thrust O
into O
his O
coat O
- O
pocket O
, O
he O
gave O
but O
one S-CARDINAL
farewell O
look O
at O
the O
retreating O
drapery O
of O
poor O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
and O
then O
with O
rapid O
strides O
, O
and O
thoughts O
so O
full O
of O
the O
scene O
which O
had O
just O
passed O
, O
that O
he O
followed O
the O
right O
path O
rather O
mechanically O
than O
from O
judgment O
, O
he O
set O
off O
upon O
his O
return O
to O
the O
humble O
lodging O
he O
had O
secured O
for O
the O
night O

A O

A O
PAINFUL O
VISIT O
, O
BUT O
MEETS O
MANY O
OLD O
ACQUAINTANCES O
. O
The O
morning's O
walk O
had O
been O
a O
long O
one O
, O
even O
for O
Michael B-PERSON
Armstrong E-PERSON
, O
and O
right O
glad O
was O
he O
to O
find O
himself O
again O
in O
the O
neatly O
- O
sanded O
kitchen O
of O
his O
little O
inn O
, O
with O
a O
loaf O
and O
cheese O
before O
him O
, O
of O
sufficient O
dimensions O
to O
resist O
any O
attacks O
he O
could O
make O
upon O
them O
. O
A O
moderate O
proportion O
of O
beer O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
solid O
meal O
these O
afforded O
, O
refreshed O
him O
so O
effectually O
that O
he O
determined O
to O
take O
his O
leave O
of O
Mr. O
Bell S-PERSON
that O
night O
, O
preparatory O
to O
setting O
off O
on O
his O
return O
to O
Westmorland S-GPE
on O
the B-TIME
following I-TIME
morning E-TIME
, O
in O
order O
to O
bid O
farewell O
to O
his O
good O
old O
master O
there O
. O
On O
the O
subject O
of O
Martha's S-ORG
bank O
- O
notes O
he O
meant O
to O
be O
entirely O
guided O
by O
the O
advice O
of O
the O
clergyman O
, O
being O
equally O
fearful O
of O
offending O
, O
or O
rather O
of O
paining O
their O
generous O
owner O
by O
refusing O
to O
accept O
them O
, O
or O
of O
depriving O
her O
of O
what O
might O
be O
hereafter O
useful O
by O
agreeing O
to O
do O
so O
. O
" O
I O
have O
seen O
Miss O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
sir O
! O
" O
were O
his O
first S-ORDINAL
words O
on O
entering O
Mr. O
Bell's S-PERSON
parlour O
, O
and O
both O
look O
and O
accent O
showed O
that O
the O
interview O
had O
been O
an O
interesting O
one O
. O
" O
But O
, O
alas O
! O
she O
is O
greatly O
altered O
, O
" O
he O
added O
, O
restraining O
with O
difficulty O
the O
tears O
that O
rose O
to O
his O
eyes O
. O
" O
I O
fear O
she O
is O
very O
ill O
| | O
— O
but O
she O
was O
glad O
— O
oh O
! O
so O
glad O
to O
see O
me O
, O
sir O
! O
She O
has O
been O
fretting O
, O
poor O
dear O
young O
lady O
, O
under O
the O
false O
notion O
that O
she O
had O
been O
to O
blame O
about O
me O
| | O
but O
, O
thank O
Heaven O
! O
think O
she O
knows O
better O
now O
, O
and O
perhaps O
when O
her O
mind O
is O
at O
ease O
again O
she O
may O
recover O
health O
. O
I O
can't O
bear O
to O
think O
how O
pale O
and O
thin O
she O
is O
grown O
, O
and O
all O
about O
me O
, O
to O
whom O
she O
was O
the O
best O
and O
kindest O
friend O
that O
ever O
poor O
boy O
had O
. O
And O
see O
, O
sir O
, O
what O
she O
has O
done O
now O
! O
" O
continued O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
drawing O
forth O
the O
roll O
of O
notes O
from O
his O
pocket O
. O
" O
Here O
is O
a O
large O
sum O
of O
money O
, O
I O
believe O
. O
She O
did O
not O
rightly O
know O
how O
much O
it O
was O
herself O
, O
she O
told O
me O
, O
because O
she O
had O
kept O
on O
putting O
by O
what O
she O
did O
not O
want O
, O
and O
had O
never O
counted O
how O
much O
it O
came O
to O
— O
and O
I'm O
sure O
I O
have O
not O
counted O
it O
either O
| | O
but O
whether O
it O
is O
little O
or O
much O
, O
I O
don't O
feel O
quite O
certain O
whether O
I O
ought O
to O
take O
it O
. O
" O
Mr. O
Bell S-PERSON
smiled O
at O
the O
unusual O
manner O
in O
which O
the O
rich O
- O
looking O
, O
but O
carelessly O
- O
packed O
roll O
of O
paper O
had O
passed O
from O
one S-CARDINAL
hand O
to O
the O
other O
. O
Before O
he O
examined O
the O
contents O
he O
questioned O
Michael S-PERSON
as O
to O
all O
that O
the O
generous O
- O
hearted O
girl O
had O
said O
to O
him O
, O
on O
bestowing O
it O
, O
and O
the O
young O
man's O
faithful O
answers O
soon O
convinced O
him O
that O
there O
would O
be O
little O
kindness O
to O
the O
self O
- O
reproaching O
Martha S-PERSON
in O
refusing O
a O
donation O
which O
she O
evidently O
considered O
as O
an O
atonement O
, O
and O
which O
would O
, O
he O
doubted O
not O
, O
by O
its O
application O
to O
Michael's O
necessities O
, O
do O
more O
towards O
healing O
her O
wounded O
mind O
than O
any O
other O
thing O
whatever O
. O
" O
You O
must O
not O
refuse O
the O
gift O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Bell S-PERSON
, O
after O
hearing O
his O
narrative O
to O
the O
end O
. O
" O
I O
do O
not O
wonder O
, O
little O
as O
she O
has O
been O
to O
blame O
in O
the O
matter O
, O
at O
her O
having O
suffered O
greatly O
for O
all O
that O
she O
innocently O
made O
you O
suffer O
| | O
nor O
am O
I O
at O
all O
surprised O
, O
since O
it O
was O
in O
her O
power O
to O
do O
so O
, O
that O
she O
should O
wish O
to O
make O
you O
this O
atonement O
. O
It O
comes O
at O
a O
lucky O
moment O
, O
my O
dear O
boy O
, O
for O
not O
only O
will O
it O
enable O
you O
to O
present O
yourself O
before O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
, O
without O
throwing O
yourself O
, O
as O
you O
said O
yesterday S-DATE
, O
upon O
her O
charity O
, O
but O
I O
suspect O
it O
may O
go O
far O
in O
assisting O
your O
hopes O
of O
entering O
into O
some O
business O
, O
which O
may O
enable O
you O
to O
support O
yourself O
. O
" O
Mr. O
Bell S-PERSON
then O
opened O
the O
bundle O
of O
notes O
, O
and O
found O
that O
they O
amounted O
to O
rather O
more B-QUANTITY
than I-QUANTITY
five I-QUANTITY
hundred I-QUANTITY
pounds E-QUANTITY
| | O
a O
sum O
which O
, O
to O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
appeared O
so O
enormous O
that O
he O
uttered O
something O
like O
a O
remonstrance O
against O
the O
opinion O
which O
advised O
his O
appropriating O
the O
whole O
. O
" O
Did O
you O
not O
tell O
me O
, O
sir O
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
" O
that O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling's E-PERSON
affairs O
were O
not O
considered O
to O
be O
in O
so O
flourishing O
a O
state O
as O
they O
had O
been O
? O
And O
may O
not O
this O
money O
be O
wanted O
by O
Miss O
Martha S-PERSON
in O
case O
he O
should O
really O
become O
involved O
in O
difficulties O
? O
" O
will O
be O
able O
to O
secure O
sufficient O
from O
the O
relics O
of O
his O
enormous O
wealth O
to O
maintain O
his O
family O
in O
easy O
circumstances O
. O
A O
sum O
like O
this O
, O
my O
dear O
boy O
, O
is O
but O
a O
drop O
in O
such O
an O
ocean O
. O
" O
Michael S-PERSON
resisted O
no O
longer O
, O
and O
this O
point O
being O
settled O
, O
his O
plan O
of O
operations O
was O
soon O
arranged O
. O
In O
deference O
to O
Martha's S-PERSON
fears O
for O
his O
safety O
, O
he O
decided O
not O
to O
visit O
his O
good O
friend O
Richard B-PERSON
Smithson E-PERSON
, O
at O
Milford S-GPE
, O
Mr. O
Bell S-PERSON
undertaking O
to O
settle O
the O
matter O
of O
the O
loan O
, O
and O
moreover O
to O
convey O
to O
the O
kind O
- O
hearted O
man O
the O
assurances O
of O
Michael's S-PERSON
well O
- O
doing O
, O
of O
his O
gratitude O
, O
and O
hearty O
good O
wishes O
. O
The O
letter O
from O
the O
travellers O
, O
which O
was O
to O
settle O
the O
happy O
Michael's B-FAC
road E-FAC
, O
would O
probably O
arrive O
within O
a B-DATE
week I-DATE
or I-DATE
two E-DATE
, O
and O
Mr. O
Bell S-PERSON
recommended O
that O
, O
having O
paid O
his O
farewell O
visit O
to O
Westmorland S-GPE
he O
should O
return O
to O
Fairly O
, O
and O
there O
equip O
himself O
in O
such O
a O
manner O
as O
would O
be O
suitable O
for O
presenting O
himself O
before O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
. O
Mr. O
Bell S-PERSON
agreed O
to O
take O
the O
custody O
of O
his O
treasure O
, O
till O
his O
return O
, O
and O
with O
his O
bundle O
again O
on O
his O
shoulder O
, O
and O
five B-QUANTITY
pounds E-QUANTITY
in O
his O
pocket O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
set O
off O
to O
walk O
over O
the O
fells O
and O
moors O
he O
had O
to O
traverse O
, O
with O
a O
lightness O
of O
spirit O
that O
seemed O
to O
strew O
the O
deserts O
with O
flowers O
, O
and O
made O
every O
blast O
that O
blew O
upon O
him O
as O
soft O
and O
sweet O
as O
the O
gales O
of O
Araby S-PERSON
. O
It O
was O
not O
the O
least O
, O
perhaps O
, O
of O
his O
pleasures O
, O
as O
he O
strode O
sturdily O
along O
, O
to O
compare O
his O
present O
walk O
with O
that O
which O
had O
conducted O
him O
from O
the B-LOC
Deep I-LOC
Valley E-LOC
to O
Ashleigh S-PERSON
, O
four B-DATE
years I-DATE
before E-DATE
. O
The O
suffering O
, O
the O
terror O
, O
and O
the O
final O
agony O
of O
that O
expedition O
could O
not O
come O
over O
his O
mind O
, O
however O
, O
without O
throwing O
a O
shade O
over O
his O
gladness O
| | O
but O
it O
chastened O
without O
obscuring O
the O
bright O
combination O
of O
objects O
that O
glowed O
in O
the O
prospect O
before O
him O
| | O
and O
, O
altogether O
, O
it O
would O
be O
difficult O
to O
find O
any O
walk O
on O
record O
more O
replete O
with O
enjoyment O
than O
this O
of O
Michael S-PERSON
to O
the O
humble O
mountain O
- O
home O
that O
had O
so O
kindly O
sheltered O
him O
. O
It O
was O
with O
a O
very O
flattering O
mixture O
of O
joy O
and O
sorrow O
that O
the O
good O
statesman O
and O
his O
family O
accepted O
Michael's S-PERSON
farewell O
, O
and O
listened O
to O
his O
happy O
hopes O
| | O
and O
it O
was O
amidst O
blessings O
and O
hearty O
good O
wishes O
that O
once O
again O
he O
sallied O
forth O
to O
wend O
his O
way O
for O
the O
last O
time O
over O
the O
mountains O
, O
and O
bid O
a O
fond O
and O
lingering O
adieu O
to O
his O
beloved O
lakes O
and O
tarns O
. O
He O
felt O
that O
those O
had O
been O
to O
him O
as O
teachers O
and O
preachers O
, O
elevating O
his O
heart O
and O
imagination O
, O
and O
preparing O
him O
, O
more O
effectually O
perhaps O
than O
any O
other O
school O
could O
have O
done O
, O
for O
the O
different O
sphere O
of O
life O
in O
which O
he O
now O
hoped O
to O
move O
. O
London S-GPE
taken O
, O
and O
all O
things O
ready O
for O
his O
setting O
off O
, O
save O
that O
he O
still O
expected O
an O
answer O
to O
a O
very O
cautiously O
- O
worded O
epistle O
which O
he O
had O
ventured O
to O
address O
to O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
informing O
her O
that O
he O
was O
setting O
off O
for O
Nice S-PERSON
, O
and O
that O
any O
letter O
or O
message O
she O
might O
wish O
to O
convey O
to O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
, O
should O
be O
carefully O
delivered O
by O
her O
faithful O
humble O
servant O
, O
M. B-PERSON
A. I-PERSON
Michael E-PERSON
was O
at O
breakfast O
with O
his O
kind O
and O
hospitable O
friends O
, O
when O
a O
lad O
, O
bearing O
great O
marks O
of O
hasty O
travelling O
in O
his O
appearance O
, O
made O
his O
way O
into O
the O
room O
, O
and O
with O
a O
look O
that O
seemed O
to O
prophesy O
eventful O
tidings O
, O
if O
he O
were O
but O
asked O
for O
them O
, O
delivered O
a O
letter O
to O
Mr. O
Bell S-PERSON
. O
This O
proved O
, O
however O
, O
to O
be O
only O
a O
blank O
cover O
, O
enclosing O
one O
to O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
which O
was O
handed O
to O
him O
, O
while O
the O
eyes O
of O
his O
host O
and O
hostess O
fixed O
themselves O
with O
some O
anxiety O
on O
his O
face O
. O
Michael S-PERSON
tore O
open O
the O
despatch O
, O
and O
changed O
colour O
as O
he O
read O
it O
. O
Then O
, O
giving O
an O
intelligible O
glance O
at O
the O
messenger O
who O
ceased O
not O
to O
wipe O
his O
forehead O
with O
one S-CARDINAL
arm O
, O
while O
he O
held O
his O
hat O
squeezed O
to O
his O
side O
with O
the O
other O
, O
he O
said O
, O
" O
I O
should O
like O
to O
speak O
to O
you O
about O
this O
, O
Mr. O
Bell S-PERSON
. O
" O
" O
Go O
into O
the O
kitchen O
, O
my O
lad O
, O
" O
said O
the O
clergyman O
, O
" O
and O
get O
some O
breakfast O
. O
You O
shall O
know O
when O
the O
answer O
is O
ready O
. O
" O
Though O
evidently O
disappointed O
at O
being O
thus O
dismissed O
unquestioned O
, O
the O
boy O
consoled O
himself O
with O
the O
hope O
of O
a O
kitchen O
audience O
, O
and O
making O
his O
reverence O
, O
retired O
. O
" O
What O
in O
the O
world O
have O
you O
got O
there O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
? O
" O
demanded O
Mr. O
Bell S-PERSON
. O
" O
Not O
good O
news O
, O
I O
am O
afraid O
? O
" O
" O
No O
, O
indeed O

sir O

replied O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
" O
very O
far O
from O
it O

It O
is O
from O
Miss O
Martha B-PERSON

in O
great O
distress O

it O

us O

good O
fellow O

you O
? O
If O
there O

no O

the O
contrary O

" O
" O
What O
is O
written O
here O

cannot O
long O

a O
secret O

to O
prepare O

all O
my O

away O

The O
two S-CARDINAL
little O

Mr. O
Bell S-PERSON

" O
I O
imagine O

confusion O

Yet O
I O
cannot O
guess O
what O
you O
can O
do O
for O
her O
. O
However O
, O
you O
must O
go O
immediately O
of O
course O

you O
had O
better O
hire O
a O
chaise O

no O
time O
may O
be O
lost O

I O
would O
advise O
you O

Michael S-PERSON

to O
take O
with O
you O
the O
pocket O

book O

Mrs. O
Bell S-PERSON
packed O
up O
for O
you O
so O
carefully O
last B-TIME
night E-TIME

fear O
that O
it O
is O

too O
likely O
your O
prediction O
will O
be O
fulfilled O
already O

that O
the O
poor O
young O
lady O
may O
be O
glad O

have O
some O
of O
her O
notes O

" O
" O
Thank O
God O

that O
I O

replied O
Michael S-PERSON

fervently O

" O
It O

round O

table O

corner O
, O
discoursing O
upon O
themes O

appeared O

occasion O
them O
much O
merriment O

But O
among O
all O
these O

there O
was O
not O
one O
that O
looked O
like O
a O
servant O
of O
the O
house O

and O
taking O
advantage O
of O
the O
confusion O

seemed O
to O
license O
the O
freedom O
, O
he O
walked O
on O
without O
speaking O
to O
any O
of O
them O
, O
and O
determined O
to O
trust O
to O
his O
memory O
for O
finding O
the O
small O
morning O
- O
parlour O
which O
used O
to O
contain O
all O
poor O
Martha's O
little O
literary O
personalties O
, O
and O
in O
which O
all O
his O
reading O
and O
writing O
lessons O
had O
been O
received O
. O
Neither O
his O
recollection O
nor O
his O
conjeture O
deceived O
him O

he O
found O
the O
apartment O
he O
sought O
, O
and O
on O
opening O
the O
door O
, O
discovered O
Martha S-PERSON
sitting O
there O
. O
But O
she O
was O
not O
, O
as O
he O
had O
hoped O
to O
find O
her O
, O
alone O
. O
On O
a O
sofa O
placed O
opposite O
the O
windows O
sat O
a O
figure O
, O
bolt O
upright O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
it O
, O
with O
a O
sofa O

her O
entirely O
covered O
with O
trinkets O

delicate O

other O
valuable O

A O
quantity O
of O
cotton O
- O
wool O
lay O
on O
the O
sofa O
beside O
her O
, O
and O
her O
long O
lean O
fingers O
were O
actively O
employed O
in O
selecting O
the O
most O
precious O
articles O
, O
enveloping O
them O
in O
the O
wool O
, O
and O
then O
cramming O
them O
into O
a O
large O
basket O
that O
stood O
before O
her O
, O
— O
sometimes O
selecting O
one O
, O
either O
smaller O

more O
precious O
than O
the O
rest O
, O
and O
thrusting O
it O
into O
her O
pocket O
or O
up O
her O
sleeve O
. O
A O
large O
Indian S-NORP
screen O
was O
spread O
before O
the O
door O
, O
which O
induced O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
on O
hearing O
a O
voice O
that O
certainly O
was O
not O
that O
of O
his O
friend O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
to O
remain O
unseen O
long O
enough O
to O
decide O
whether O
his O
entrance O
would O
be O
likely O
to O
occasion O
her O
any O
embarrassment O
. O
" O
I O
tell O
you O
, O
Martha S-PERSON

that O
you O
talk O
like O
a O

what O
you O

said O
the O
upright O
lady O
, O
in O
a O
shrill O
voice O
, O
but O
in O
a O
tone O
that O
she O
was O
endeavouring O

reduce O
to O
a O
whisper O

would O
not O

where O

better O

Miss O
Martha S-PERSON

I O
am O
sure O
I O
don't O
know O

belief O

that O
he O

mad O

mad O

a O
jail O

comfortable O

as O
it O
must O
be O

suit O

there O
is O
such O
a O
thing O
in O
the O
house O

a O
basin O
of O
soup O
for O
my O
luncheon O

I O
may O
ring O

ring O

there O

bell O

Martha S-PERSON
made O
no O
reply O

she O
rose O
from O
her O
chair O
, O
and O
Michael S-PERSON
stepped O
back O
into O
the O
passage O
, O
that O
she O
might O
not O
meet O
him O
within O
hearing O
of O
her O
selfish O
step O

mother O

" O

exclaimed O
the O
poor O
girl O

on O
catching O
sight O

him O

" O

reasons O

Michael S-PERSON
followed O
her O
to O
the O
well O
- O
remembered O
drawing O
- O
room O
, O
which O
had O
so O
often O
witnessed O
the O
display O
of O
Sir O
Matthew's S-PERSON
munificent O
charity O
, O
by O
showing O
him O
off O
to O
all O
the O
neighbourhood O

The O
recollection O
was O
very O
hateful O
to O
him O
, O
yet O
the O
right O
- O
hearted O
lad O
felt O
a O
pang O
as O
he O
accompanied O
his O
benefactress O
into O
this O
greatly O
- O
altered O
scene O
of O
former O
splendour O

The O
whole O
house O
was O
under O
preparation O
for O
a O
sale O
by O
auction O
, O
and O
nothing O
could O
exceed O
the O
speaking O
state O
of O
gilded O
desolation O
which O
this O
fine O
room O
exhibited O

Never O
mind O
the O
confusion O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
! O
Just O
step O
over O
these O
curtains O
— O
we O
can O
sit O
down O
, O
up O
in O
that O
corner O
of O
the O
room O

take O
care O
of O
the O
mirrors O
, O
my O
dear O
boy O
! O
Surely O
they O
have O
thrown O
these O
costly O
things O
about O
more O
heedlessly O
than O
was O
necessary O
! O
" O
said O
poor O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
as O
she O
led O
the O
way O
rather O
over O
, O
then O
through O
the O
scattered O
mass O
of O
splendid O
furniture O
with O
which O
the O
room O
was O
strewed O
. O
" O
It O
is O
strange O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
" O
she O
resumed O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
they O
had O
seated O
themselves O
in O
a O
clear O
space O
of O
six B-QUANTITY
feet E-QUANTITY
wide O
, O
where O
two S-CARDINAL
chairs O
were O
standing O
near O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
windows O
, O
— O
" O
it O
is O
strange O
, O
most O
strange O
, O
that O
you O
should O
be O
the O
only O
person O

I O
could O
think O
of O

his O
misery O

You O
who O
have O
suffered O
so O
severely O
from O
— O
from O
his O
displeasure O

I O
found O
out O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
that O
you O
had O
a O
kind O
, O
good O
heart O

when O
you O
used O
to O
talk O
to O
me O
of O
your O
mother O

poor O
Teddy S-PERSON

It O
was O
that O
which O
made O
me O
take O
notice O
of O
you O
then O
, O

it O
is O
that O

makes O
me O
ask O
for O
your O
assistance O
now O

happy O

I O
can O
do O
you O
any O
good O

Miss O
Martha S-PERSON

" O
replied O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
eagerly O
. O
" O
I O
have O
brought O
back O
the O
notes O

failed O
him O

at O
times O
his O
temper O

been O
so O
variable O

him O

intemperate O

now O
— O
In O
short O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
I O
greatly O
fear O
that O
his O
reason O
is O
shaken O
by O
the O
misfortunes O
that O
have O
fallen O
upon O
him O
. O
He O
has O
kept O
all O
his O
commercial O
disasters O
so O
completely O
to O
himself O
, O
that O
not O
even O
his O
most O
confidential O
agents O
were O
at O
all O
aware O
of O
their O
extent O
| | O
and O
I O
therefore O
hope O
that O
if O
I O
can O
contrive O
to O
remove O
him O
from O
this O
melancholy O
scene O
, O
his O
mind O
will O
be O
relieved O
by O
felling O
that O
the O
worst O
is O
over O
, O
and O
that O
I O
may O
have O
the O
exceeding O
happiness O
of O
seeing O
him O
restored O
to O
reason O
and O
to O
health O
. O
" O
" O
And O
in O
what O
way O
then O
can O
I O
be O
useful O
to O
you O
, O
my O
dear O
Miss O
Martha S-PERSON
? O
I O
dare O
not O
combat O
your O
will O
, O
but O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
if O
his O
creditors O
are O
stripping O
his O
house O
in O
this O
way O
, O
such O
a O
sum O
as O
you O
have O
put O
into O
my O
hands O
might O
be O
very O
useful O
to O
him O
, O
" O
said O
Michael S-PERSON
. O
Do O
you O
think O
you O
could O
manage O
to O
get O
a O
chaise O
to O
the O
gates O
without O
its O
being O
known O
that O
it O
was O
for O
him O
? O
" O
" O
I O
am O
quite O
sure O
of O
it O
, O
" O
replied O
Michael S-PERSON
| | O
" O
for O
to O
save O
time O
I O
came O
hither O
in O
a O
chaise O
myself O
, O
which O
is O
now O
waiting O
at O
the O
public O
- O
house O
to O
take O
me O
back O
to O
Fairly O
. O
I O
have O
only O
to O
go O
and O
tell O
the O
boy O
that O
I O
shall O
not O
be O
able O
to O
return O
before O
night O
, O
in O
order O
to O
have O
him O
ready O
to O
start O
at O
any B-TIME
hour E-TIME
you O
please O
. O
" O
" O
To O
Fairly O
? O
" O
said O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
musingly O
. O
" O
But O
it O
is O
no O
matter O
— O
he O
may O
sleep O
at O
the O
inn O
there O
as O
well O
as O
at O
any O
other O
, O
and O
the O
next O
morning O
we O
must O
make O
our O
way O
to O
the O
nearest O
port O
where O
there O
is O
a O
chance O
of O
our O
finding O
a O
steam O
- O
boat O
going O
to O
France S-GPE
. O
It O
will O
not O
do O
at O
present O
for O
my O
father O
to O
remain O
in O
the O
country O
. O
When O
he O
has O
got O
his O
certificate O
, O
he O
will O
be O
safe O

but O
I O
greatly O
fear O
some O
difficulty O
about O
it O
. O
" O
While O
Martha S-PERSON
was O
thus O
explaining O
her O
hopes O
and O
fears O
, O
the O
sound O
of O
carriage O
- O
wheels O
was O
heard O
slowly O
approaching O
by O
the O
road O
which O
led O
to O
the O
chief O
entrance O
, O
and O
which O
passed O
at O
no O
great O
distance O
from O
the O
window O
at O
which O
they O
were O
sitting O
. O
" O
Here O
comes O
Dr. O
Crockley S-PERSON
! O
" O
she O
exclaimed O
| | O
" O
I O
am O
very O
glad O
his O
visit O
will O
be O
over O
so O
early O

This O
will O
give O
me O
time O
for O
preparation O

" O
But O
she O
was O
mistaken O

the O
equipage O
she O
heard O
a O
approaching O
was O
not O
the O
recently O
set O

up O
cab O
of O
Dr. O
Crockley S-PERSON
, O
but O
the O
donkey O
- O
chair O
of O
the O
ever O
active O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
. O
Nothing O
could O
be O
much O
farther O
from O
poor O
Martha's S-PERSON
inclination O
than O
encountering O
the O
prying O
old O
woman O
at O
this O
moment O
| | O
but O
having O
hastily O
told O
Michael S-PERSON
to O
appear O
as O
if O
he O
were O
employed O
in O
taking O
a O
catalogue O
of O
the O
furniture O
, O
for O
which O
purpose O
, O
paper O
, O
pens O
, O
and O
ink O
lay O
conveniently O
ready O
on O
one O
of O
the O
marbleslabs O
, O
she O
hurried O
out O
into O
the O
hall O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
meeting O
the O
physician O
, O
and O
attending O
him O
as O
usual O
to O
her O
father O
— O
so O
that O
the O
avoiding O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
was O
impossible O
. O
" O
Oh O
, O
my O
poor O
dear O
Martha S-PERSON
! O
that's O
you O
, O
is O
it O
? O
Well O
now O
! O
you O
was O
just O
the O
person O
I O
wanted O
to O
see O
. O
But O
I O
do O
wonder O
you O
did O
not O
get O
off O
with O
your O
father O
, O
poor O
man O
! O
when O
he O
made O
his O
escape O
, O
this B-TIME
morning E-TIME
, O
" O
said O
the O
unchanged O
little O
lady O
. O
" O
I O
know O
not O
what O
you O
mean O
, O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
, O
" O
replied O
Martha S-PERSON
gravely O
. O
" O
My O
poor O
father O
has O
been O
extremely O
ill O
, O
and O
is O
at O
this O
moment O
confined O
to O
his O
bed O
. O
" O
The O
old O
lady O
gave O
a O
wink O
with O
one O
of O
her O
little O
cunning O
black O
eyes O
, O
and O
nodding O
her O
head O
very O
expressively O
, O
replied O
, O
" O
Old O
birds O
are O
not O
caught O
with O
chaff O
, O
my O
dear O
. O
" O
" O
What O
is O
it O
that O
you O
mean O
, O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
— O
that O
you O
do O
not O
believe O
me O
? O
" O
said O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
indignantly O
. O
" O
You O
are O
very O
foolish O
to O
bawl O
out O
in O
that O
manner O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
with O
that O
young O
fellow O
that's O
cataloguing O
in O
there O
, O
close O
within O
hearing O
. O
Mind O
, O
it O
is O
your O
fault O
and O
not O
mine O
, O
if O
he O
suspects O
any O
thing O
from O
your O
violence O

" O
good O
as O
to O
see O
my O
poor O
father O
, O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
? O
I O
would O
not O
wish O
you O
to O
stay O
long O
with O
him O
, O
for O
he O
is O
very O
feverish O

but O
I O
dare O
say O
he O
would O
take O
it O
very O
kindly O
if O
you O
will O
just O
come O
in O
to O
inquire O
for O
him O
. O
" O
Looking O
a O
good O
deal O
surprised O
, O
but O
accepting O
the O
invitation O
with O
great O
alacrity O
, O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
began O
to O
mount O
the O
stairs O
| | O
exceedingly O
well O
pleased O
to O
have O
an O
opportunity O
of O
procuring O
so O
excellent O
a O
ticket O
of O
admission O
to O
every O
house O
in O
the O
neighbourhood O
, O
as O
this O
ocular O
demonstration O
of O
the O
actual O
condition O
of O
the O
fallen O
knight O
would O
furnish O
. O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
in O
compliance O
with O
the O
order O
he O
had O
received O
, O
followed O
after O
| | O
and O
in O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes E-TIME
, O
found O
himself O
once O
more O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
man O
under O
whose O
tyranny O
he O
had O
suffered O
so O
terribly O
. O
But O
a O
harder O
heart O
than O
Michael's S-PERSON
might O
have O
been O
softened O
into O
forgiveness O
and O
forgetfulness O
of O
all O
former O
injuries O
, O
by O
the O
miserable O
aspect O
of O
the O
wretched O
man O
who O
lay O
stretched O
upon O
the O
splendid O
bed O
that O
he O
could O
no O
longer O
call O
his O
own O
. O
His O
steadfast O
- O
minded O
and O
affectionate O
daughter O
— O
the O
only O
earthly O
good O
that O
avenging O
Heaven O
had O
left O
him O

entered O
first S-ORDINAL
, O
intending O
to O
announce O
the O
visit O
of O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON

but O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
started O
up O
in O
bed O
, O
and O
before O
she O
could O
speak O
, O
cried O
out O
, O
" O
Do O
not O

that O
devil O
Crockley S-PERSON

me O

dear O
papa O

just O
come O
to O
ask O
you O
how O
you O
are O

Martha S-PERSON

leading O
the O
old O
lady O
to O
the O
bedside O

will O
not O
stay O

you O

well O
enough O

talk O

you O
will O
be O
glad O

her O

" O
" O
Glad O

said O
the O
miserable O
man O
, O
knitting O
his O
brows O
, O
and O
throwing O
upon O
her O
a O
look O
of O
deep O
aversion O

" O
Don't O
I O
know O
her O

Is O
she O
not O
the O
town O

crier O
of O
all O
the O
country O

Have O
I O
not O
paid O
her O
for O
it O
a O
hundred S-CARDINAL
times O

do O
you O

Somebody O
else O

pay O
her O
now O

bringing O
them O
word O
how O
the O
poor O
bankrupt O
Dowling S-PERSON
looks O

" O
" O
Well O
now O
, O
that O
is O
terrible O

to O
be O
sure O

Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON

" O

talking O

me O

Matthew S-PERSON

" O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
looked O
so O
very O
much O
as O
if O
he O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
take O
her O
up O
in O
his O
enormous O
hand O

throw O
her O
to O
the O
further O
end O
of O
the O
room O

Martha S-PERSON
thought O
it O
prudent O

prevent O
her O
nearer O
approach O

have O
now O
seen O

could O
testify O
to O
having O
seen O
him O

listened O
to O
him O

ascertained O
how O
he O
seemed O
to O
bear O
it O

It O
was O
impossible O

would O
the O
still O
brisk O
little O

crept O
under O
the O
toilet O

table O

glorious O
an O
opportunity O

instead O
of O
attending O
to O
Martha's S-PERSON
repeated O
assurance O
that O
she O
" O
had O
better O
go O
now O
, O
" O
she O
began O
opening O
sundry O
physic O

stood O
on O
a O
table O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O

smelling O
some O

judgment O

" O

stay O
here O
, O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
behind O
the O
bed- O
curtains O
, O
till O
Dr. O
Crockley S-PERSON
comes O
, O
and O
I O
think O
it O
may O
be O
very O
useful O
for O
us O
to O
have O
a O
little O
conversation O
together O
. O
I O
know O
my O
poor O
dear O
father's O
method O
in O
these O
cases O
as O
well O
as O
he O
did O
himself O
, O
and O
he O
was O
regular O
bred O
you O
know O
, O
which O
is O
more O
than O
we O
can O
say O
of O
poor O
dear O
Dr. O
Crockley S-PERSON
. O
" O
Exceedingly O
provoked O
, O
Martha S-PERSON
now O
addressed O
her O
father O
, O
saying O
, O
" O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
wishes O
to O
stay O
, O
papa O
, O
till O
Dr. O
Crockley S-PERSON
comes O
, O
in O
order O
that O
they O
may O
have O
a O
consultation O
about O
you O

but O
you O
won't O
like O
that O
, O
shall O
you O
? O
" O
" O
Like O
it O
? O
" O
replied O
the O
prostrate O
man O
, O
with O
bitterness O
, O
" O
Oh O
! O
dear O
yes O
, O
I O
shall O
like O
it O
vastly O
! O
They O
are O
exactly O
a O
fitting O
pair O
to O
come O
together O
, O
glowering O
and O
gloating O
round O
the O
bed O
of O
a O
ruined O
neighbour O
. O
Let O
her O
stay O
, O
by O
all O
means O
, O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
let O
her O
stay O
and O
watch O
it O
all O
. O
See O
, O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
, O
there O
is O
a O
young O
auctioneering O
gentleman O
come O
to O
take O
an O
account O
of O
the O
furniture O
. O
Isn't O
it O
pleasant O
? O
I O
am O
sure O
it O
must O
do O
your O
heart O
good O
to O
see O
it O
. O
Don't O
go O
away O
, O
young O
man O
! O

he O
continued O
, O
addressing O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
who O
, O
shocked O
and O
disgusted O
, O
was O
making O
his O
way O
towards O
the O
door O
. O
" O
Don't O
go O
away O

on O

losing O
a O
little O
time O

I O
dare O
say O
you O
will O
be O
paid O
for O
it O
all O
the O

my O

not O

it O
half O
so O
much O
if O
she O

something O
of O

on O

" O

of O
such O
a O
thing O
! O
I O
am O
sure O
, O
for O
one O
, O
I O
can O
answer O
for O
it O
that O
I O
never O
did O

doll O
of O
a O

been O
dead O

I've O
no O

catching O
Sir O
Matthew's S-PERSON
fierce O
eye O
fixed O
upon O
her O

condescension O

hold O
up O

finger O

you O
would O
not O
be O
so O
ungenerous O
as O
to O
refuse O
now O

merely O

if O
you O

sweet O
Mrs. O

tell O

she O

a O
daughter O

noble O
house O
of O
Highlandloch S-PERSON

I O

before O

to O
give O
her O
a O
parting O
token O
of O
remembrance O

diamond O

Mrs. O

you O

have O
a O
sentimental O
parting O

told O
me O

set O
off O

will O

the O
right O
time O

won't O
it O
, O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
? O
" O
Perfectly O
well O
disposed O
to O
execute O
the O
commission O
, O
and O
quite O
as O
desirous O
as O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
could O
be O
that O
the O
proud O
poor O
lady O
who O
had O
ever O
treated O
her O
with O
haughty O
coldness O
, O
should O
be O
properly O
humbled O
, O
she O
darted O
towards O
the O
door O
, O
in O
order O
to O
perform O
her O
errand O

but O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
remembering O
the O
manner O
in O
which O
she O
had O
left O
her O
step O
- O
mother O
engaged O
, O
stepped O
forward O
to O
prevent O
her O
, O
quietly O
saying O
, O
" O
If O
my O
father O
wishes O
to O
see O
his O
wife O

Mrs. O

I O
can O
go O
for O
her O
, O
without O
troubling O
you O
— O
and O
I O
really O
wish O
you O
would O
permit O
me O
to O
lead O
you O
down O
stairs O
to O
your O
donkey O
- O
chair O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
— O
I O
am O
sure O
you O
must O
be O
aware O
that O

not O
in O
a O
state O
to O
bear O
seeing O
company O

" O
" O
You O
are O
quite O
right O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
quite O
right O
, O
indeed O
— O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
is O
looking O
sadly O
wild O
and O
feverish O
, O
and O
I O
should O
say O
that O
nobody O
whatever O
but O
the O
doctor O
and O
his O
own O
family O
ought O
to O
see O
him O
. O
Of O
course O
I O
suppose O
it O
would O
not O
be O
very O
convenient O
to O
hire O
attendants O
now O
, O
for O
these O
sort O
of O
people O
, O
I O
am O
sorry O
to O
say O
, O
always O
insist O
upon O
ready O
money O
, O
which O
is O
a O
cruel O
thing O
under O
such O
circumstances O
. O
But O
so O
it O
is O
, O
and O
therefore O
it O
follows O
that O
you O
and O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa E-PERSON
must O
be O
the O
chief O
nurses O
. O
" O
" O
Certainly O
, O
ma'am O
, O
it O
will O
be O
his O
own O
family O
who O
will O
wish O
to O
attend O
to O
him O
. O
And O
therefore O
, O
if O
you O
please O
, O
I O
will O
take O
you O
down O
stairs O
, O
and O
see O
you O
to O
your O
carriage O
. O
" O
and O
get O
out O
of O
the O
room O
. O
He O
must O
have O
gone O
over O
every O
thing O
by O
this O
time O
, O
mustn't O
he O
? O
" O
" O
I O
will O
have O
her O
right O
honourable O
ladyship O
here O
before O
that O
fellow O
stirs O
a O
step O
, O
Martha S-PERSON
. O
Do O
you O
hear O
me O
? O
That's O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
half E-CARDINAL
the O
fun O
, O
" O
cried O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
bursting O
into O
a O
shout O
of O
laughter O
. O
" O
Doesn't O
she O
know O
our O
kind O
, O
clever O
, O
observing O

here O
so O
thoughtfully O
, O
just O
to O
look O
about O
her O
a O
little O
? O
Doesn't O
she O
know O
her O
, O
almost O
as O
well O
as O
I O
do O
? O

won't O
she O
enjoy O
thinking O
what O
a O
pleasant O
description O
dear O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
will O
be O
able O
to O
give O
of O
my O
Lord O
Highlandloch's S-PERSON
sweet O
daughter O
watching O
the O
broker O
, O
and O
seeing O
that O
he O
sets O
every O
thing O
down O
fair O
? O
" O
Thankful O
was O
Martha S-PERSON
that O
the O
supposed O
broker O
was O
one O
who O
could O
not O
in O
reality O
add O
to O
the O
horror O
of O
the O
scene O
. O
She O
turned O
to O
him O
as O
she O
left O
the O
room O
, O
saying O
, O
" O
You O
had O
better O
remain O
here O
, O
if O
you O
please O
, O
till O
I O
return O
, O
" O
upon O
which O
he O
modestly O
ensconced O
himself O
in O
a O
distant O
corner O
of O
the O
room O
, O
and O
resting O
his O
paper O
upon O
a O
commode O
, O
continued O
, O
as O
he O
stood O
, O
to O
scribble O
upon O
it O

certain O
that O
it O
would O
be O
impossible O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
till O
her O
father's O
summons O
to O
his O
proud O
wife O
had O
been O
obeyed O
, O
and O
greatly O
more O
anxious O
to O
clear O
his O
room O
of O
this O
troublesome O
guest O
, O
than O
to O
spare O
the O
feelings O
of O
her O
ladyship O
, O
Martha S-PERSON
entered O
the O
little O
sittingroom O
, O
determined O
to O
deliver O
the O
message O
concerning O
the O
diamond O
- O
ring O
, O
if O
she O
could O
not O
prevail O
without O
it O

found O

in O
the O
act O
of O
finishing O
the O
packing O
of O
her O
basket O

laying O
on O
the O
top O
of O
it O
sundry O
light O
articles O
of O
female O
attire O
, O
very O
cleverly O
calculated O
to O
make O
the O
whole O
pass O
under O
the O
general O
description O
of O
wearing O
- O
apparel O
, O
which O
the O
courtesy O
of O
the O
law O
permits O

be O
removed O
by O
all O

unfortunate O
situation O

cease O
your O
impertinent O
preaching O

as O
the O
pale O

agitated O
young O
woman O

the O
room O

examined O

brutes O

conceive O

made O

up O

obediently O
set O
herself O
to O
collect O
the O
scattered O
fragments O
of O
the O
suspicious O

looking O
wool O

she O
did O
so O

leave O
him O

- O
morrow O
, O
he O
should O
wish O
to O
see O
you O
once O
more O
, O
" O
replied O
Martha S-PERSON
. O
excuse O
me O
in O
some O
degree O
in O
the O
eyes O
of O
my O
noble O
brother O
, O
for O
the O
degradation O
I O
brought O
upon O
him O
by O
accepting O
it O
! O
" O
These O
last O
words O
were O
uttered O
with O
clasped O
hands O
, O
raised O
eyes O
, O
fervent O
accents O
, O
and O
all O
other O
ordinary O
indications O
of O
uttering O
a O
prayer O
. O
Indignant O
and O
disgusted O
, O
Martha S-PERSON
felt O
no O
scruple O
in O
employing O
the O
means O
her O
father O
had O
given O
her O
for O
obtaining O
the O
interview O
he O
desired O
, O
and O
quietly O
said O
in O
reply O
to O
this O
burst O
, O
" O
My O
father O
stated O
that O
his O
motive O
for O
asking O
to O
see O
you O
, O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa E-PERSON
, O
proceeded O
from O
his O
wish O
to O
present O
to O
you O
, O
as O
a O
parting O
gift O
, O
the O
diamond O
ring O
which O
he O
wears O
on O
his O
right O
hand O
. O
" O
The O
effect O
of O
these O
words O
was O
as O
sudden O
as O
that O
produced O
by O
the O
magic O
touch O
of O
a O
hand O
employed O
in O
turning O
off O
gas O
. O
" O
That O
indeed O
is O
a O
most O
natural O
wish O
! O
Unhappy O
, O
guilty O
man O
! O
I O
can O
well O
believe O
that O
had O
he O
the O
crown O
jewels O
at O
command O
, O
he O
would O
deem O
them O
all O
too O
poor O
an O
offering O
to O
atone O
for O
the O
offence O
he O
has O
committed O
against O
me O
! O
I O
thank O
God O
, O
Martha B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
, O
that O
my O
noble O
blood O
has O
never O
taught O
me O
to O
forget O
that O
I O
am O
a O
Christian S-NORP
! O
There O
are O
many O
women O
, O
believe O
me O
there O
are O
, O
of O
less O
exalted O
rank O
than O
myself O
, O
who O
would O
not O
deign O
to O
obey O
such O
a O
summons O
. O
But O
I O
feel O
what O
my O
duties O
are O
, O
and O
I O
shall O
nerve O
my O
courage O
to O
perform O
them O
. O
Come O
with O
me O
to O
my O
dressing O
- O
room O
, O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
carry O
that O
basket O
for O
me O
, O
and O
then O
I O
will O
go O
with O
you O
to O
the O
bedside O
of O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
. O
" O
Martha S-PERSON
attempted O
to O
obey O
, O
but O
the O
basket O
was O
too O
heavy O
for O
her O
to O
carry O
, O
and O
she O
set O
it O
down O
again O
, O
declaring O
that O
the O
task O
was O
beyond O
her O
strength O
. O
" O
A O
tolerably O
good O
joke O
that O
, O
" O
said O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa E-PERSON
, O
endeavouring O
to O
laugh O
, O
" O
considering O
your O
origin O

but O
this O
is O
the O
last O
day O
of O
such O
pleasant O
jestings O
, O
and O
therefore O
I O
must O
bear O
it O
with O
good O
humour O
I O
suppose O
. O
" O
Then O
applying O
her O
own O
much O
stronger O
hand O
, O
she O
lifted O
her O
treasure O
, O
and O
was O
stalking O
off O
with O
it O
| | O
but O
stopped O
short O
ere O
she O
reached O
the O
door O
, O
saying O
, O
" O
No O
, O
I O
will O
stay O
here O
while O
you O
go O
and O
fetch O
my O
faithful O
Mistress B-PERSON

She O
enters O
into O
all O
my O
feelings O

thank O
God O

and O
is O
as O
strong O
as O
a O
Highland S-NORP

into O
the O
bargain O

" O
Having O
obediently O
performed O
this O
commission O
, O
and O
brought O
back O
the O
faithful O
Scotch S-PERSON
waiting O
- O
woman O

who O
had O
adhered O
very O
steadfastly O
to O
her O
mistress O
through O
all O
the O
vicissitudes O
of O
her O
fortune O
, O
Martha S-PERSON
at O
length O
succeeded O
in O
marshalling O
the O
Lady O
Clarissa B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
into O
the O
bedroom O
of O
her O
husband O
. O
No O
signet O
- O
ring O
ever O
made O
a O
deeper O
impression O
on O
wax O
, O
than O
the O
diamond O
one O
of O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
had O
done O
on O
the O
memory O
of O
his O
noble O
wife O

and O
her O
first S-ORDINAL
glance O
, O
as O
she O
entered O
the O
room O
, O
was O
directed O
to O
the O
hand O
which O
lay O
on O
the O
bedclothes O
, O
that O
she O
might O
see O
if O
it O
had O
been O
already O
removed O

but O
on O
! O
there O
it O
sparkled O
still O
, O
and O
with O
a O
gentler O
aspect O
than O
she O
had O
been O
seen O
to O
wear O
since O
the O
tremendous O
hour O
when O
the O
declension O
of O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
from O
the O
richest O
commoner O
in O
the O
county O
into O
a O
bankrupt O
, O
had O
been O
announced O
to O
her O
, O
she O
said O
, O
" O
You O
wish O
to O

Martha S-PERSON

you O
wish O

see O
me O

" O
" O
Yes O
my O
beloved O
! O

the O
knight O

" O
I O
do O
wish O
to O
see O
you O

Angelic O
sweetness O
! O
How O
can O
I O
do O
otherwise O
? O
Look O
at O
yourself O
in O
the O
mirror O
, O
most O
beautiful O
Clarissa S-PERSON
? O
Look O
in O
the O
mirror O
before O
that O
broker O
there O
carries O
it O
off O
, O
and O
tell O
me O
if O
you O
think O
it O
possible O
that O
any O
man O
could O
bear O
to O
part O
with O
so O
much O
beauty O
, O
without O
having O
one S-CARDINAL
final O
gaze O
upon O
it O
? O
And O
see O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
here O
is O
your O
amiable O
neighbour O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
! O
Is O
it O
not O
kind O
of O
her O
to O
leave O
all O
other O
visitings O
, O
that O
she O
may O
come O
to O
nestle O
herself O
here O
, O
among O
the O
very O
brokers O
, O
in O
the O
very O
centre O
of O
our O
misery O
? O
It O
is O
so O
heavenly O
- O
minded O
of O
her O
, O
isn't O
it O
? O
I O
guessed O
indeed O
that O
one S-CARDINAL
great O
reason O
for O
her O
making O
such O
a O
tremendous O
sacrifice O
was O
the O
hope O
of O
edification O
from O
beholding O
the O
christian O
spirit O
with O
which O
your O
ladyship O
bears O
your O
ladyship's O
overthrow O

and O
besides O
her O
own O
improvement O
from O
it O
, O
she O
wishes O
to O
have O
it O
in O
her O
power O
to O
describe O
it O
to O
the O
whole O
neighbourhood O
. O
Very O
right O
of O
her O
, O
isn't O
it O
, O
my O
dear O
? O
And O
that O
is O
the O
reason O
why O
I O
sent O
for O
you O
. O
" O
In O
general O
the O
nose O
of O
Lady O
Clarissa S-PERSON
greatly O
outblushed O
her O
cheeks O
, O
which O
had O
more O
of O
the O
jonquil O
than O
the O
rose O
in O
them O
| | O
but O
now O
, O
from O
the O
tip O
of O
her O
high O
forehead O
, O
to O
that O
of O
her O
long O
chin O
, O
she O
became O
crimson O
| | O
and O
but O
from O
the O
remarkable O
length O
of O
her O
throat O
, O
which O
seemed O
to O
rear O
itself O
in O
defiance O
of O
such O
danger O
, O
a O
fit O
of O
apoplexy O
might O
have O
been O
expected O
. O
" O
Begone O
! O
you O
vulgar O
gossip O
- O
picker O
! O
" O
she O
cried O
, O
turning O
in O
uncontrollable O
rage O
upon O
the O
terrified O
little O
woman O
, O
" O
and O
tell O
the O
contemptible O
neighbourhood O
through O
which O
you O
are O
going O
to O
crawl O
in O
your O
donkey O
- O
cart O
, O
like O
a O
snail O
in O
his O
shell O
, O
leaving O
your O
slime O
as O
you O
go O
, O
tell O
them O
all O
, O
from O
me O
, O
that O
the O
best O
consolation O
under O
my O
remorse O
at O
having O
forgotten O
my O
own O
dignity O
by O
condescending O
to O
hold O
a O
place O
among O
them O
, O
arises O
from O
being O
released O
from O
the O
degradation O
of O
associating O
with O
so O
contemptible O
a O
being O
as O
yourself O
, O
and O
all O
who O
are O
capable O
of O
listening O
to O
you O
! O
" O
And O
having O
uttered O
these O
words O
in O
a O
piercing O
voice O
, O
she O
rushed O
to O
the O
door O
, O
threw O
it O
with O
great O
violence O
wide O
open O
, O
and O
so O
left O
it O
, O
as O
she O
paced O
, O
with O
rapid O
but O
tragic O
strides O
, O
to O
the O
shelter O
of O
her O
own O
boudoir O
, O
and O
the O
sympathy O
of O
Mistress B-PERSON
Saunderson E-PERSON
. O
It O
was O
, O
perhaps O
, O
because O
the O
door O
was O
open O
, O
and O
that O
he O
knew O
the O
sound O
would O
follow O
her O
, O
that O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
burst O
into O
the O
most O
violent O
shout O
of O
laughter O
that O
ever O
made O
itself O
heard O
from O
mortal O
lungs O
| | O
it O
terrified O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
made O
Michael B-PERSON
Armstrong E-PERSON
shudder O
, O
and O
caused O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
herself O
to O
wish O
she O
were O
any O
where O
else O
, O
notwithstanding O
the O
very O
valuable O
information O
this O
extraordinary O
scene O
would O
enable O
her O
to O
communicate O
. O
Long O
did O
this O
frightful O
laugh O
continue O
, O
and O
when O
strength O
seemed O
to O
fail O
, O
and O
the O
boisterous O
merriment O
could O
be O
sustained O
no O
longer O
, O
a O
vehement O
and O
reiterated O
hissing O
followed O
, O
which O
at O
length O
ended O
in O
such O
complete O
exhaustion O
that O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
fell O
back O
pale O
, O
and O
apparently O
motionless O
, O
upon O
his O
pillow O
. O
" O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
Martha S-PERSON

" O
I O
must O
beg O
you O

leave O
us O
now O

You O
must O
perceive O
that O
my O
poor O
father O
ought O
to O
be O
alone O

It O
is O
very O
important O

fearfully O
important O

I O
am O
afraid O

should O
be O
kept O
perfectly O
quiet O

me O
leave O
to O
wish O
you O
good O
morning O

in O
calling O
me O
company O

Good O
gracious O
! O
To O
think O
of O
the O
terms O
on O
which O
I O
have O
always O
been O
in O
this O
house O
before O
your O
poor O
papa's O
unfortunate O
marriage O
! O
I O
cannot O
and O
I O
will O
not O
leave O
you O
in O
such O
a O
condition O
. O
It O
would O
be O
perfectly O
monstrous O
, O
and O
every O
body O
would O
call O
me O
a O
brute O
for O
it O
. O
Till O
Dr. O
Crockley S-PERSON
has O
been O
here O
, O
I O
really O
neither O
can O
nor O
will O
go O
. O
I O
am O
quite O
determined O
that O
I O
will O
hear O
what O
he O
says O
about O
him O
. O
" O
" O
Let O
her O
stay O
, O
" O
said O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
hollow O
whisper O
, O
which O
proved O
that O
he O
was O
neither O
asleep O
nor O
dead O
, O
though O
his O
closed O
eyes O
, O
and O
ghastly O
countenance O
, O
might O
have O
been O
mistaken O
for O
one S-CARDINAL
state O
or O
the O
other O
. O
Martha S-PERSON
went O
to O
him O
, O
took O
his O
hand O
, O
wiped O
the O
profuse O
perspiration O
from O
his O
brow O
, O
and O
then O
placing O
herself O
in O
a O
chair O
beside O
him O
, O
continued O
to O
watch O
his O
altered O
countenance O
, O
alike O
unmindful O
as O
it O
seemed O
of O
the O
presence O
of O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
, O
or O
that O
of O
Michael S-PERSON
either O
. O
The O
lady O
, O
perfectly O
contented O
to O
be O
thus O
quietly O
established O
as O
a O
looker O
- O
on O
, O
determined O
, O
for O
the O
present O
, O
neither O
to O
move'nor O
speak O
, O
lest O
she O
might O
lose O
the O
valued O
privilege O
thereby O

but O
Michael S-PERSON
became O
so O
conscious O
of O
the O
awkwardness O
of O
his O
situation O
, O
and O
so O
fearful O
lest O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
from O
forgetting O
him O
, O
might O
get O
into O
a O
scrape O
likewise O
, O
that O
he O
ventured O
to O
approach O
the O
foot O
of O
the O
bed O
on O
tiptoe O
, O
merely O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
recalling O
himself O
to O
her O
recollection O
, O

then O
, O
on O
seeing O
her O
start O
at O
the O
sight O
of O
him O
, O
he O
said O
in O
a O
whisper O
, O
" O
I O
suppose O

had O
better O
go O

Martha S-PERSON

" O
Martha S-PERSON
in O
reply O
to O
this O
nodded O
affirmatively O
, O
and O
in O
the O
same O
low O
tone O
added O
, O
" O
I O
shall O
have O
other O
business O

" O
Michael's S-PERSON
eyes O
were O
naturally O
turned O
to O
Martha S-PERSON
while O
this O
passed O

but O
when O
he O
withdrew O
them O
, O
and O
was O
about O
to O
make O
his O
retreat O
, O
he O
caught O
the O
large O
, O
wide O
open O
, O
wild O
- O
looking O
eyes O
of O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
fixed O
earnestly O
upon O
him O
. O
The O
young O
man O
involuntarily O
dropped O
his O
eyelids O
, O
for O
the O
gaze O
was O
a O
frightful O
one O
, O
and O
turned O
to O
leave O
the O
room O
. O
" O
Stay O
! O
" O
roared O
a O
hoarse O
but O
loud O
and O
stunning O
voice O
from O
the O
bed O
. O
" O
Stay O

" O
state O
of O
mind O
and O
body O

and O
the O
subsequent O
discovery O
of O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
of O
whose O
visit O
to O
the O
factory O
he O
had O
heard O
from O
Parsons S-PERSON
, O
and O
at O
whose O
escape O
he O
expressed O
the O
most O
unbridled O
rage O
, O
accelerated O
symptoms O
which O
had O
before O
threatened O
him O
, O
and O
sent O
such O
a O
rush O
of O
blood O
to O
the O
brain O
as O
instantly O
produced O
apoplexy O
, O
and O
left O
him O
totally O
deprived O
of O
sense O
and O
motion O
. O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
whose O
eyes O
were O
fixed O
upon O
him O
, O
uttered O
a O
fearful O
shriek O
, O
and O
threw O
herself O
on O
the O
body O
, O
believing O
that O
he O
was O
dead O
. O
But O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
knew O
better O
. O
She O
had O
practised O
too O
long O
as O
an O
amateur O
not O
to O
know O
a O
fit O
of O
apoplexy O
when O
she O
saw O
it O
, O
and O
promptly O
exclaimed O
, O
" O
Get O
away O
, O
Martha S-PERSON
! O
Get O
off O
of O
him O
, O
child O
! O
He O
is O
not O
dead O
, O
I O
tell O
you O
, O
and O
, O
if O
we O
could O
but O
bleed O
him O
, O
he O
would O
open O
his O
eyes O
again O
fast O
enough O
. O
" O
With O
the O
rapidity O
of O
lightning O
poor O
Martha S-PERSON
obeyed O
. O
She O
withdrew O
herself O
from O
the O
bed O
, O
endeavoured O
to O
raise O
her O
father O
in O
her O
arms O
, O
and O
, O
by O
the O
help O
of O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
succeeded O
. O
She O
then O
bared O
his O
arm O
, O
bound O
her O
own O
waist O
- O
belt O
tightly O
round O
it O
, O
and O
with O
unshrinking O
courage O
had O
thrust O
a O
sharp O
penknife O
which O
she O
drew O
from O
her O
pocket O
into O
a O
vein O
, O
before O
the O
skillful O
lady O
who O
had O
prescribed O
the O
measure O
had O
half O
recovered O
her O
astonishment O
on O
perceiving O
that O
the O
poor O
girl O
had O
conceived O
the O
project O
of O
putting O
it O
into O
immediate O
execution O
. O
The O
old O
adage O
that O
" O
where O
there O
is O
a O
will O
, O
there O
is O
a O
way O
, O
" O
was O
never O
better O
illustrated O
than O
by O
this O
act O
of O
the O
tender O
- O
hearted O
and O
invalided O
Martha S-PERSON
. O
She O
felt O
that O
her O
father's O
life O
hung O
on O
the O
promptness O
with O
which O
the O
operation O
was O
performed O
| | O
she O
felt O
too O
, O
that O
if O
she O
shrunk O
from O
it O
, O
there O
was O
no O
one O
else O
who O
would O
perform O
it O
, O
and O
totally O
forgetful O
of O
herself O
and O
her O
own O
feelings O
conquered O
the O
rebellious O
weakness O
that O
would O
have O
held O
her O
hand O
, O
and O
did O
what O
two B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
before O
she O
would O
have O
believed O
it O
utterly O
impossible O
she O
could O
have O
done O
. O
The O
result O
did O
honour O
to O
the O
skill O
of O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
. O
The O
lazy O
current O
flowed O
, O
though O
reluctantly O
. O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
opened O
his O
large O
eyes O
, O
rolled O
them O
from O
side O
to O
side O
, O
heaved O
a O
deep O
and O
heavy O
sigh O
, O
and O
presently O
attempted O
to O
speak O
, O
but O
this O
was O
beyond O
his O
power O
. O
" O
What O
more O
should O
be O
done O
? O
" O
said O
the O
pale O
, O
and O
now O
trembling O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
turning O
towards O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
. O
" O
Why O
now O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
you O
must O
just O
let O
him O
alone O
for O
a O
little O
bit O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
physician O
by O
hereditary O
right O
. O
" O
Well O
now O
! O
" O
she O
added O
, O
" O
Wasn't O
it O
a O
blessing O
that O
I O
was O
here O
? O
If O
I O
had O
not O
staid O
, O
he O
would O

dead O

Such O
was O
the O
state O
of O
affairs O
in O
the O
bedroom O
of O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
, O
when O
Dr. O
Crockley S-PERSON
entered O
it O
. O
Were O
all O
the O
words O
which O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
then O
uttered O
in O
explanation O
of O
what O
she O
had O
done O
, O
why O
she O
had O
done O
it O
, O
and O
how O
her O
doings O
had O
answered O
, O
to O
be O
written O
down O
here O
, O
my O
waning O
pages O
would O
hardly O
suffice O
to O
contain O
them O
. O
Dr. O
Crockley S-PERSON
nodded O
, O
winked O
, O
approved O
, O
and O
applauded O
a O
great O
deal O
, O
joked O
a O
little O
, O
and O
finally O
felt O
the O
patient's O
pulse O
, O
observing O
at O
the O
same O
time O
that O
it O
was O
necessary O
at O
any O
rate O
to O
bring O
him O
round O
sufficiently O
to O
get O
a O
little O
talk O
on O
business O
out O
of O
him O
, O
before O
he O
popped O
off O
for O
good O
and O
all O
. O
" O
Very O
right O
and O
proper O
if O
you O
can O
manage O
it O
, O
doctor O
, O
" O
sagaciously O
observed O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
. O
" O
But O
you O
may O
depend O
upon O
it O
, O
that O
— O
" O
and O
here O
she O
whispered O
something O
, O
that O
it O
was O
especially O
intended O
Martha S-PERSON
should O
be O
neither O
the O
better O
nor O
the O
worse O
for O
. O
The O
doctor O
nodded O
and O
winked O
, O
and O
nodded O
again O
| | O
and O
then O
turning O
to O
the O
poor O
girl O
who O
was O
not O
only O
the O
one O
who O
alone O
in O
that O
presence O
cared O
any O
thing O
for O
the O
prostrate O
millocrat O
, O
but O
the O
one O
of O
all O
created O
beings O
who O
would O
alone O
have O
felt O
his O
death O
to O
be O
a O
cause O
of O
mourning O
. O
Dr. O
Crockley S-PERSON
turned O
to O
her O
, O
and O
with O
very O
little O
of O
even O
the O
external O
decency O
of O
sympathy O
said O
, O
" O
Do O
you O
think O
you O
can O
manage O

get O
some O
mustard O

my O
dear O
, O
out O
of O
the O
clutches O
of O
the O
bailiffs O

because O
that O
is O
what O
we O
want O
here O
. O
" O
Without O
answering O
, O
Martha S-PERSON
moved O
towards O
the O
door O
| | O
and O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
not O
conceiving O
that O
the O
physician's O
words O
were O
but O
a O
brutal O
jest O
, O
and O
fancying O
that O
Martha S-PERSON
might O
really O
have O
to O
petition O
those O
who O
now O
held O
authority O
in O
the O
household O
for O
the O
article O
wanted O

stepped O
after O
her O
, O
to O
request O
that O
he O
might O
execute O
the O
commission O
in O
her O
place O

" O
You O
shall O
come O
down O
with O

I O
doubt O

will O
be O
able O

procure O
what O

want O
without O
difficulty O

alas O
! O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
it O
will O
avail O
nothing O

I O
am O
sure O
by O
their O
whispering O

that O
they O
both O
know O
it O
will O

nothing O

it O
shall O

tried O

is O
it O
not O
dreadful O
that O
of O
all O

numerous O
family O
there O
should O

only O
one O

receive O
his O
dying O
breath O

added O
with O
clasped O

streaming O
eyes O

" O

it O

judgment O

it O
atone O

he O
found O

was O

up O

down O

such O

it O
may O
be O
that O
the O
interests O
of O
others O
are O
at O
stake O

when O
I O
recall O
my O
father's O
earnestness O
as O
he O
spoke O
of O
the O
necessity O
of O
seeing O
him O
, O
I O
tremble O
at O
the O
idea O
of O
disobeying O
him O

Go O
then O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
! O
hasten O
to O
the O
factory O
, O
and O
tell O
this O
man O
that O
his O
master O
is O
very O
ill O
, O
but O
that O
if O
he O
recovers O
his O
senses O
and O
his O
speech O
, O
it O
is O
probable O
he O
may O
wish O
to O
speak O
to O
him O

" O
Michael S-PERSON
lost O
no O
time O
in O
obeying O
her O

and O
on O
reaching O
the O
mills O
found O
the O
superintendent O
, O
as O
usual O
, O
at O
his O
post O
. O
At O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
glance O
he O
did O
not O
recognise O
the O
messenger O
, O
for O
the O
appearance O
of O
the O
young O
man O
was O
greatly O
changed O
by O
the O
style O
of O
equipment O
which O
, O
under O
the O
advice O
of O
Mr. O
Bell S-PERSON
, O
had O
been O
provided O
for O
him O
. O
No O
sooner O
did O
Michael S-PERSON
speak O
, O
however O
, O
than O
the O
man O
started O
, O
as O
if O
he O
had O
been O
shot O
. O
" O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
send O
you O
? O
" O
he O
exclaimed O
, O
" O
what O
mountebank O
tricks O
are O
you O
got O
at O
now O

you O

bamboozled O

you O

, O
perhaps O
, O
my O
nice O
young O

you O
fancy O

that O

won't O

any O

putting O
such O

elegant O
young O

enough O

a O
sneer O
. O
" O
Sir O
Matthew's S-PERSON

changed O

nature O

The O
young O

is O
quite O
right O

I O
shouldn't O

thought O

told O
her O
any O
thing O

" O
Michael S-PERSON

, O
at O
the O
moment O
he O
was O
about O
to O
pass O
the O
threshold O
, O
something O
in O
the O
eye O
of O
the O
superintendent O
made O
him O
pause O
. O
He O
recollected O
full O
well O
the O
ready O
lock O
of O
that O
once O
hated O
door O

and O
it O
struck O
him O
, O
as O
by O
no O
means O
impossible O
, O
that O
his O
old O
acquaintance O
might O
turn O
it O
upon O
him O
, O
if O
he O
put O
it O
in O
his O
power O
to O
do O
so O
. O
Fears O
for O
his O
own O
personal O
safety O
, O
he O
certainly O
had O
none O
, O
being O
quite O
aware O
that O
he O
was O
no O
longer O
in O
danger O
of O
being O
kidnapped O
as O
heretofore O

but O
the O
idea O
of O
Martha S-PERSON
being O
left O
, O
at O
this O
her O
utmost O
need O
, O
in O
want O
of O
any O
little O
service O
he O
could O
afford O
, O
was O
quite O
enough O
to O
make O
him O
cautious O
, O
and O
with O
something O
of O
an O
involuntary O
smile O
, O
he O
stepped O
back O
, O
saying O
, O
" O
There O
is O
no O
occasion O

saying O
, O
he O
turned O
round O

walked O
out O
of O
the O
yard O
. O
" O
Pestilent O
young O
viper O
! O
" O
muttered O
the O
superintendent O
between O
his O
closed O
teeth O

" O

him O

him O
snug O
by O

give O
him O

If O
I O

put O
out O

it O
would O
have O

peacock O

to O
changing O

of O
Mr. O

Michael S-PERSON
slackened O
his O
pace O
, O
being O
rather O
inclined O
to O
have O
the O
society O
of O
his O
former O
tyrant O

" O
Sir O

appears O
to O
be O
in O
a O
very O
dangerous O
state O

Mr. O
Parsons S-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
sulky O
superintendent O
came O
up O
to O
him O
. O
" O
Perhaps O
your O
right O
honourable O
greatness O
has O
been O
studying O
medicine O
, O
since O
I O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
taking O
that O
little O
drive O
with O
you O
into O
Derbyshire S-GPE
? O
" O
" O
I O
have O
studied O
many O
things O
since O
that O
time O

Mr. O
Parsons S-PERSON

" O
replied O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
laughing O

" O
and O
one O
is O
the O
nature O
and O
use O
of O
locks O
. O
" O
The O
tone O
in O
which O
this O
was O
answered O
was O
so O
brutal O
, O
that O
the O
young O
man O
, O
rather O
from O
disgust O
than O
anger O
, O
walked O
on O
faster O
than O
his O
foe O
could O
follow O
him O

and O
reaching O
the O
house O
some B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
before O
him O
, O
made O
his O
way O
again O
without O
ceremony O
— O
for O
it O
was O
no O
time O
for O
it O
— O
into O
the O
apartment O
of O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
. O
A O
considerable O
change O
had O
taken O
place O
in O
the O
condition O
of O
the O
patient O
since O
he O
left O
it O
. O
The O
cataplasms O
had O
so O
far O
succeeded O
as O
to O
restore O
animation O
and O
consciousness O
: O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
still O
surrounded O
by O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
, O
and O
the O
doctor O
, O
was O
gazing O
upon O
them O
with O
widely O
- O
opened O
eyes O
, O
which O
, O
though O
wild O
and O
wandering O
in O
expression O
, O
were O
evidently O
not O
devoid O
of O
speculation O
. O
Michael S-PERSON
had O
entered O
very O
gently O
, O
but O
not O
without O
being O
heard O
by O
the O
sick O
man O

for O
he O
turned O
his O
eyes O
full O
upon O
him O
as O
he O
approached O
. O
The O
sight O
of O
him O
, O
however O
, O
no O
longer O
seemed O
to O
produce O
any O
emotion O
| | O
for O
after O
looking O
quietly O
at O
him O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
turned O
his O
gaze O
upon O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
, O
who O
from O
being O
in O
the O
act O
of O
leaning O
over O
him O
, O
brought O
herself O
particularly O
within O
his O
sight O
. O
" O
Is O
Parsons S-PERSON
come O
? O
" O
said O
Martha S-PERSON
in O
a O
whisper O
. O
" O
He O
must O
be O
in O
the O
hall O
by O
this O
time O
, O
" O
replied O
Michael S-PERSON
: O
" O
shall O
I O
tell O
him O
to O
come O
up O
? O
" O
" O
My O
dear O
father O
has O
not O
yet O
spoken O
, O
" O
she O
said O

" O
but O
, O
perhaps O
, O
he O
may O
understand O
me O

— O
Parsons S-PERSON
is O
here O
, O
papa O

she O
added O
, O
taking O
her O
father's O
hand O
, O
and O
leaning O
over O
him O
— O
" O
should O
you O
like O
to O
see O
him O

" O
" O
He O
is O
in O
London S-GPE
, O
my O
dear O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
knight O
very O
distinctly O
. O
" O
Thank O
God O
! O
" O
exclaimed O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
tenderly O
kissing O
him O
— O
" O
Thank O
God O
! O
His O
speech O
is O
not O
in O
the O
least O
affected O
! O
" O
" O
Rather O
wandering O
, O
though O
, O
" O
said O
Dr. O
Crockley S-PERSON
, O
winking O
his O
eye O
at O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
. O
" O
I O
should O
say O
, O
bleed O
him O
again O
, O
if O
you O
want O
to O
get O
any O
thing O
out O
of O
him O

" O
observed O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
, O
looking O
sagaciously O
at O
the O
doctor O
. O
" O
Perhaps O
I O
may O
, O
in O
an O
hour O
or O
two S-CARDINAL
, O
" O
he O
replied O
, O
applying O
his O
finger O
to O
the O
patient's O
pulse O
. O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
fixed O
his O
eyes O
upon O
him O
, O
and O
laughed O
a O
horrid O
, O
rattling O
, O
ghastly O
sort O
of O
laugh O
, O
that O
seemed O
to O
come O
from O
his O
throat O
. O
" O
You O
haven't O
quite O
done O
with O
me O
yet O
, O
have O
you O
, O
Crockley S-PERSON

said O
he O

" O
Done O
with O
you O
, O
my O
dear O
friend O
? O
God O
forbid O
! O
" O
replied O
the O
physician O
, O
rather O
startled O
at O
the O
apparently O
healthy O
state O
of O
his O
patient's O
intellect O
, O
and O
affectionately O
smoothing O
his O
pillows O
, O
and O
settling O
the O
bedclothes O
about O
him O
. O
" O
Would O
you O
like O
to O
see O
Parsons S-PERSON
, O
dear O
papa O
? O
" O
said O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
gently O
, O
and O
again O
bending O
over O
him O
. O
" O
Oh O
, O
yes O
! O
" O
he O
replied O
eagerly O

" O
I'll O
see O
Parsons S-PERSON
now O

directly O

I O

Parsons S-PERSON

give O
, O
with O
as O
little O
disturbance O
to O
him O
as O
possible O
. O
On O
reaching O
the O
hall O
, O
however O
, O
she O
saw O
him O
not O
, O
and O
was O
on O
the O
point O
of O
returning O
up O
stairs O
to O
inquire O
of O
Michael S-PERSON
where O
he O
had O
left O
him O
, O
when O
she O
caught O
the O
sound O
of O
his O
voice O
from O
Sir O
Matthew's S-PERSON
study O
. O
On O
entering O
this O
room O
she O
perceived O
not O
only O
Mr. O
Parsons S-PERSON
but O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa E-PERSON
, O
who O
, O
standing O
before O
the O
commode O
in O
which O
, O
as O
she O
happened O
to O
know O
, O
her O
husband O
was O
accustomed O
to O
keep O
papers O
of O
importance O
, O
as O
well O
as O
money O
, O
appeared O
to O
have O
been O
very O
assiduously O
examining O
its O
contents O
| | O
for O
every O
recess O
had O
evidently O
been O
visited O
, O
and O
, O
as O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
her O
hands O
was O
tightly O
clutched O
over O
a O
pocket O
- O
book O
, O
it O
seemed O
that O
her O
researches O
had O
not O
been O
wholly O
in O
vain O
, O
and O
that O
she O
had O
not O
privately O
obtained O
possession O
of O
his O
keys O
for O
nothing O
. O
" O
I O
was O
sent O
for O
, O
my O
lady O
, O
" O
said O
Parsons S-PERSON
, O
apparently O
replying O
to O
some O
question O
of O
her O
ladyship's O
, O
which O
, O
to O
judge O
by O
her O
angry O
frown O
, O
and O
the O
vexed O
expression O
of O
her O
countenance O
, O
had O
not O
been O
a O
civil O
one O
. O
" O
My O
father O
wishes O
to O
see O
Mr. O
Parsons S-PERSON
directly O
, O
" O
said O
Martha S-PERSON
. O
" O
And O
by O
your O
ladyship's O
leave O
I O
must O
take O
that O
green O
pocket O
- O
book O
with O
me O
, O
" O
said O
Parsons S-PERSON
. O
" O
What O
pocket O
- O
book O
, O
you O
rude O
fellow O
? O
" O
replied O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa E-PERSON
, O
indignantly O
. O
" O
That O
one O
as O
your O
ladyship O
now O
holds O
in O
your O
left O
hand O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
confidential O
superintendent O
. O
" O
I O
wonder O
, O
sirrah O
, O
that O
you O
do O
not O
ask O
me O
to O
give O
you O
the O
rings O
off O
my O
fingers O
! O
" O
cried O
the O
angry O
mistress O
of O
the O
mansion O
. O
" O
Go O
to O
your O
master O
, O
fellow O
, O
if O
he O
has O
sent O
for O
you O
, O
and O
I O
shall O
go O
too O
. O
So O
you O
need O
not O
trouble O
yourself O
about O
the O
pocket O
- O
book O
. O
" O
And O
with O
these O
words O
she O
pushed O
past O
both O
Martha S-PERSON
and O
Mr. O
Parsons S-PERSON
, O
preceding O
them O
to O
the O
sick O
man's O
chamber O
. O
By O
the O
time O
they O
entered O
it O
his O
eyes O
were O
again O
closed O
, O
but O
he O
appeared O
to O
breathe O
without O
difficulty O
, O
though O
rather O
more O
audibly O
than O
usual O
, O
and O
Martha S-PERSON
fancied O
that O
he O
was O
asleep O
. O
" O
Hush O
! O
" O
said O
she O
. O
" O
Do O
not O
disturb O
him O
. O
He O
is O
sleeping O
. O
" O
Dr. O
Crockley S-PERSON
and O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
had O
withdrawn O
to O
a O
window O
, O
and O
were O
evidently O
in O
consultation O
| | O
but O
whether O
on O
the O
symptoms O
of O
apoplexy O
, O
or O
bankruptcy O
, O
might O
be O
doubtful O
. O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
however O
, O
was O
standing O
close O
beside O
the O
bed O
, O
and O
in O
answer O
to O
Martha's S-PERSON
observation O
shook O
his O
head O
, O
saying O
, O
" O
No O
! O
not O
asleep O
. O
" O
" O
Then O
he'll O
manage O
to O
hear O
what O
I've O
got O
to O
say O
to O
him O
, O
" O
said O
Parsons S-PERSON
, O
advancing O
, O
and O
throwing O
a O
glance O
of O
spiteful O
vengeance O
at O
Lady O
Clarissa S-PERSON
, O
" O
because O
it O
is O
just O
what O
he O
wants O
to O
know O
. O
" O
At O
the O
sound O
of O
Parsons's S-ORG
voice O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
opened O
his O
eyes O
, O
and O
made O
an O
effort O
to O
raise O
himself O
, O
but O
this O
was O
beyond O
his O
power O
, O
and O
it O
was O
only O
by O
being O
lifted O
with O
as O
little O
effort O
as O
possible O
on O
his O
own O
part O
, O
as O
if O
he O
were O
already O
dead O
, O
that O
he O
was O
placed O
in O
the O
attitude O
he O
seemed O
to O
desire O
, O
and O
in O
which O
he O
was O
supported O
by O
pillows O
, O
and O
by O
the O
arms O
of O
poor O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
placed O
herself O
on O
the O
bolster O
behind O
him O
. O
It O
was O
a O
frightful O
and O
awful O
expression O
which O
then O
took O
possession O
of O
his O
sunken O
features O
, O
nevertheless O
a O
hateful O
sort O
of O
smile O
made O
part O
of O
it O
. O
" O
Parsons S-PERSON
! O
that's O
you O
, O
isn't O
it O
? O
That's O
Parsons S-PERSON
that O
stands O
there O
? O
" O
he O
said O
, O
directing O
his O
misty O
eyes O
full O
upon O
the O
superintendent O
. O
" O
Yes O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
' O
tis O
me O

" O
replied O
the O
man O
. O
" O
Have O
you O
done O
my O
bidding O
, O
Parsons S-PERSON
? O
" O
demanded O
the O
knight O
, O
with O
a O
sort O
of O
gasping O
which O
seemed O
to O
threaten O
that O
his O
breath O
was O
about O
to O
leave O
him O
. O
" O
Yes O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
it's O
all O
regularly O
made O
out O
, O
" O
replied O
Parsons S-PERSON
, O
" O
nobody O
can O
mistake O
now O
about O
times O
or O
dates O
in O
any O
way O

" O
" O
And O
isn't O
that O
the O
Honourable O
Lady O
Clarissa S-PERSON
? O
" O
said O
the O
sick O
man O
, O
directing O
his O
eyes O
towards O
her O
. O
" O
Yes O
, O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
" O
replied O
Parsons S-PERSON
, O
with O
something O
like O
a O
titter O
. O
" O
Then O
— O

, O
" O
panted O
the O
dying O
man O
, O
" O
let O
her O
ladyship O
know O
what O
was O
the O
last O
business O
that O
I O
gave O
you O
instructions O
about O

" O
" O
A O
very O
fitting O
business O
for O
an O
honourable O
gentleman O
to O
attend O
to O
, O
when O
his O
affairs O
are O
in O
confusion O
, O
and O
he O
not O
in O
an O
over O
good O
state O
of O
health O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
confidential O
servant O
, O
turning O
himself O
round O
, O
so O
as O
exactly O
to O
face O
her O
ladyship O
. O
" O
No O
less O
a O
matter O
than O
restoring O
three B-QUANTITY

year O
, O
for O
ever O
, O
towards O
clearing O

with O
his O
creditors O
. O
" O
Now O
three B-QUANTITY
thousand I-QUANTITY
pounds E-QUANTITY
a O
year O
was O
exactly O
the O
sum O
, O
for O
the O
settlement O
of O
which O
upon O
herself O
, O
a O
daughter O
of O
the O
noble O
house O
of O
Highlandloch S-PERSON
had O
condescended O
to O
assume O
the O
name O
of O
Dowling S-PERSON
, O
and O
the O
mention O
of O
the O
often O
- O
meditated O
sum O
roused O
her O
ladyship's O
attention O
so O
effectually O
that O
her O
face O
involuntarily O
protruded O
itself O
beyond O
her O
body O
, O
till O
her O
nose O
very O
nearly O
reached O
that O
of O
the O
individual O
who O
was O
addressing O
her O
. O
" O
Go O
on O
! O
" O
said O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
, O
positively O
chuckling O
, O
though O
his O
chin O
dropped O
on O
his O
chest O
as O
he O
spoke O
. O
" O
Well O

, O
" O
resumed O
Parsons S-PERSON
, O
leering O
aside O
at O
Dr. O
Crockley S-PERSON
, O
who O
with O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
had O
drawn O
near O
to O
listen O
to O
this O
very O
interesting O
disclosure O

him O
die O

away O

than O
its O
ingenuity O
deserved O

for O
ere O
his O
tall O
rigid O
person O
had O
bent O
itself O
sufficiently O
for O
him O
to O
reach O
the O
ground O
, O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
become O
one O
of O
the O
group O
at O
the O
same O
instant O
with O
Dr. O
Crockley S-PERSON
, O
was O
in O
possession O
of O
it O
, O
and O
ere O
the O
prostrate O
Crockley S-PERSON
or O
the O
stooping O
Parsons S-PERSON
could O
raise O
their O
eyes O
, O
the O
prize O
had O
dropped O
into O
the O
deepest O
recesses O
of O
a O
prodigious O
pocket O
, O
which O
reached O
nearly O
to O
the O
bottom O
of O
her O
little O
petticoat O
. O
was O
placed O
a O
flacon O
of O
Cologne S-GPE
water O
, O
which O
poor O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
almost O
exhausted O
by O
the O
painful O
attitude O
necessary O
to O
sustain O
the O
pillows O
, O
had O
made O
him O
a O
sign O
to O
get O
for O
her O
. O
This O
movement O
brought O
him O
within O
the O
range O
of O
Sir O
Matthew's S-PERSON
eyes O
, O
and O
something O
in O
his O
aspect O
as O
he O
cautiously O
bent O
to O
take O
the O
bottle O
, O
or O
else O
the O
thick O
- O
coming O
fancies O
of O
a O
brain O
diseased O
, O
though O
not O
paralyzed O
, O
suddenly O
produced O
a O
terrible O
effect O
upon O
the O
dying O
man O
, O
and O
he O
uttered O
a O
cry O
so O
harsh O
and O
terrible O
as O
to O
constrain O
the O
attention O
even O
of O
the O
preoccupied O
group O
at O
the O
door O
. O
" O
There's O
a O
dead O
body O
walking O
about O
the O
room O
! O
" O
he O
ejaculated O
in O
an O
unnatural O
and O
frightful O
accent O
. O
" O
He O
is O
come O
for O
me O
! O
and O
I O
must O
go O
! O
" O
The O
shriek O
which O
followed O
these O
words O
was O
terrible O
. O
In O
a B-TIME
minute I-TIME
or I-TIME
two E-TIME
he O
spoke O
again O
, O
but O
almost O
in O
a O
whisper O
. O
" O
One S-CARDINAL
? O
No! O
— O
it O
is O
not O
one O
, O
it O
is O
five B-CARDINAL
hundred E-CARDINAL
! O
Take O
them O
! O
— O
take O
them O
away O
from O
me O
, O
I O
tell O
you O
! O
They O
are O
all O
dirty O
, O
beastly O
factory O
- O
children O
. O
Their O
arms O
and O
legs O
are O
all O
broken O
and O
smashed O
, O
and O
hanging O
by O
bits O
of O
skin O
. O
Take O
them O
away O
, O
I O
tell O
you O
, O
Crockley S-PERSON
! O
Their O
horrid O
joints O
will O
drop O
upon O
me O
! O
They O
are O
dangling O
and O
loose O
, O
I O
tell O
you O
! O
" O
and O
then O
again O
he O
shouted O
with O
so O
fearful O
a O
cry O
, O
that O
even O
Parsons S-PERSON
pressed O
his O
hands O
upon O
his O
ears O
to O
save O
them O
from O
the O
sound O
. O
" O
Calm O
him O
! O
calm O
him O
! O
" O
cried O
the O
trembling O
Martha S-PERSON
. O
" O
Can O
you O
not O
give O
him O
something O
that O
may O
still O
this O
dreadful O
agony O
, O
Doctor O
Crockley S-PERSON
? O
" O
" O
It O
is O
not O
a O
very O
easy O
symptom O
to O
master O
, O
Miss O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
" O
replied O
the O
physician O
drily O
. O
" O
However O
, O
it O
is O
not O
likely O
that O
it O
will O
last O
long O
. O
All O
the O
life O
that's O
left O
is O
just O
about O
the O
heart O
and O
brain O
, O
which O
is O
always O
unlucky O
if O
there O
happens O
to O
be O
any O
thing O
particular O
upon O
the O
mind O
. O
" O
" O
Parsons S-PERSON
! O
" O
cried O
the O
dying O
man O
, O
again O
raising O
his O
voice O
, O
but O
without O
looking O
towards O
the O
person O
he O
addressed O
. O
" O
Parsons S-PERSON
! O
are O
you O
not O
ashamed O
of O
yourself O
to O
turn O
the O
whole O
set O
of O
them O
out O
upon O
me O
at O
once O
in O
this O
way O
? O
You O
that O
have O
paid O
, O
and O
bribed O
, O
and O
tipped O
so O
often O

Rascal S-PERSON

Take O
them O
off O
me O
, O
I O
tell O
you O

Do O
you O

— O

" O
" O
Papa O
! O
my O
dear O
, O
dear O
papa O
! O
" O
cried O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
bending O
forward O
till O
her O
cheek O
touched O
that O
of O
her O
father O
. O
" O
Compose O
yourself O
! O

only O
that O

There O

no O
children O

" O
Her O
tender O
caresses O
, O
and O
her O
gentle O
voice O
together O
, O
seemed O
to O
reach O
, O
and O
quiet O
for O
a O
moment O
his O
wandering O
intellect O
. O
He O
made O
an O
effort O
to O
turn O
his O
head O
towards O
her O
, O
but O
that O
was O
impossible O
| | O
and O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
, O
upon O
his O
first S-ORDINAL
frightful O
cry O
, O
removed O
himself O
to O
the O
head O
of O
the O
bed O
, O
where O
the O
eye O
of O
the O
wretched O
man O
could O
not O
reach O
, O
silently O
offered O
to O
take O
Martha's S-PERSON
place O
, O
that O
she O
might O
station O
herself O
where O
it O
could O
. O
She O
quickly O
understood O
him O
, O
and O
in O
a O
moment O
stood O
where O
that O
dying O
eye O
could O
gaze O
upon O
her O
. O
His O
hand O
, O
with O
its O
glittering O
ring O
, O
still O
lay O
upon O
the O
bed O
| | O
she O
took O
it O
in O
hers O
, O
and O
fondly O
chafed O
and O
kissed O
it O
. O
But O
it O
was O
stiff O
and O
cold O
as O
marble O
! O
But O
it O
was O
too O
late O
| | O
his O
lips O
never O
opened O
more O
. O
For O
some B-TIME
hours E-TIME
longer O
he O
continued O
to O
breathe O
, O
but O
, O
on O
again O
feeling O
his O
pulse O
, O
Dr. O
Crockley S-PERSON
declared O
that O
its O
faint O
pulsations O
must O
inevitably O
cease O
before O
night S-TIME
. O
" O
I O
suppose O
your O
old O
servant O
Betty B-PERSON
Parker E-PERSON
is O
still O
in O
the O
house O
, O
Miss O
Martha S-PERSON
? O
" O
said O
he O
. O
The O
poor O
girl O
bowed O
an O
affirmative O
, O
but O
had O
no O
power O
to O
speak O
. O
" O
Well O
, O
then O
, O
" O
said O
the O
doctor O
, O
" O
I O
should O
recommend O
that O
you O
should O
put O
her O
to O
sit O
here O
| | O
it O
is O
no O
good O
for O
any O
of O
us O
to O
stay O
any O
longer O
, O
for O
it's O
all O
over O
just O
as O
much O
as O
if O
he O
was O
already O
in O
his O
coffin O
. O
You O
had O
better O
go O
away O
, O
and O
see O
what O
you O
can O
pack O
up O
to O
get O
off O
with O
, O
Miss O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
that's O
all O
that O
is O
left O
to O
be O
done O
, O
as O
far O
as O
I O
can O
see O
. O
Come O
, O
Mrs. O
Gabberly S-PERSON
, O
" O
he O
added O
, O
" O
I O
have O
got O
a O
friendly O
word O
or O
two S-CARDINAL
to O
say O
to O
you O
, O
so O
your O
boy O
shall O
mount O
my O
pony O
and O
I'll O
drive O
your O
donkey O
for O
you O
. O
" O
And O
so O
saying O
, O
he O
took O
the O
little O
woman O
under O
his O
arm O
and O
trudged O
off O
, O
without O
waiting O
for O
her O
to O
inform O
him O
whether O
she O
approved O
his O
proposal O
, O
or O
not O
. O
Mr. O
Parsons S-PERSON
, O
giving O
one S-CARDINAL
scowling O
look O
at O
the O
silent O
bed O
, O
followed O
them O
, O
and O
Martha S-PERSON
and O
Michael S-PERSON
were O
left O
together O
beside O
the O
dying O
man O
. O
Upon O
perceiving O
the O
totally O
unconscious O
state O
into O
which O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
had O
fallen O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
had O
gently O
withdrawn O
himself O
from O
behind O
his O
pillows O
, O
and O
now O
stood O
, O
almost O
as O
silent O
and O
motionless O
as O
himself O
, O
beside O
the O
bed O
, O
respectfully O
waiting O
to O
receive O
from O
the O
desolate O
and O
weeping O
martha O
some O
hint O
or O
instruction O
respecting O
his O
staying O
where O
he O
was O
, O
or O
leaving O
her O
. O
Never O
, O
when O
the O
poor O
dependant O
of O
her O
family O
, O
had O
the O
young O
heart O
of O
Michael S-PERSON
been O
impressed O
with O
a O
feeling O
of O
respect O
so O
profound O
as O
he O
at O
that O
moment O
felt O
for O
the O
unhappy O
girl O
. O
In O
truth O
the O
feeling O
was O
so O
powerful O
as O
to O
interfere O
with O
his O
usefulness O
, O
for O
he O
shrank O
from O
appearing O
to O
put O
himself O
forward O
too O
presumptuously O
by O
giving O
her O
advice O
, O
or O
venturing O
in O
any O
degree O
to O
dictate O
what O
it O
might O
be O
best O
for O
her O
to O
do O
. O
But O
when O
, O
after O
remaining O
thus O
bashfully O
silent O
for O
a B-TIME
quarter I-TIME
of I-TIME
an I-TIME
hour E-TIME
, O
he O
perceived O
that O
she O
gave O
no O
other O
sign O
of O
life O
than O
by O
tears O
that O
flowed O
incessantly O
, O
and O
sighs O
that O
seemed O
to O
heave O
her O
breast O
" O
almost O
to O
bursting O
, O
" O
— O
when O
he O
saw O
this O
, O
he O
began O
to O
think O
that O
some O
degree O
of O
seeming O
presumption O
on O
his O
part O
might O
be O
better O
and O
more O
profitable O
for O
her O
, O
whom O
he O
would O
really O
have O
died O
to O
serve O
, O
than O
the O
continuance O
of O
a O
degree O
of O
deference O
, O
which O
must O
render O
him O
useless O
. O
Approaching O
, O
therefore O
, O
to O
the O
chair O
on O
which O
she O
had O
thrown O
herself O
, O
he O
ventured O
to O
say O
, O
" O
Miss O
Martha S-PERSON
! O
where O
can O
I O
find O
your O
old O
servant O
Betty B-PERSON
Parker E-PERSON
? O
I O
remember O
her O
very O
well O
— O
she O
used O
to O
be O
always O
in O
the O
nursery O
. O
If O
you O
would O
tell O
me O
where O
she O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
, O
I O
will O
go O
for O
her O
. O
" O
Poor O
Martha S-PERSON
for O
a O
moment O
ceased O
to O
weep O
, O
and O
looked O
up O
at O
him O
. O
" O
Michael B-PERSON
Armstrong E-PERSON
! O
" O
she O
replied O
, O
" O
I O
am O
not O
conscious O
of O
ever O
having O
injured O
any O
human O

yet O
you O

the O
only O

is O
near O

me O

this B-TIME
dreadful I-TIME

your O
kindness O

good O
boy O

not O

away O

that O

not O

all O

" O
Miss O

he O
returned O
, O
" O
will O
you O

yourself O

will O
keep O
out O

stopped O

" O
His O
eyes O
will O
never O
open O
more O

" O
she O
replied O
, O
while O
the O
tears O
again O
burst O
forth O
, O
" O
and O
thank O
God O
their O
last O
look O
at O

was O
gentle O
! O

I O
almost O
fear O
to O
leave O
the O
room O

Michael S-PERSON

I O
would O
not O

his O
last O

not O

him O

" O
But O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
unskilful O
as O
he O
was O
, O
felt O
that O
the O
scene O
was O
too O
awful O
a O
one O
for O
the O
poor O
girl O
to O
be O
left O
alone O
in O
, O

he O
therefore O
persisted O
to O
declare O
with O
the O
authority O
which O
such O
subduing O
sorrow O
gives O
to O
all O
around O
who O
will O
take O
the O
trouble O
to O
exercise O
it O
, O
that O
he O
would O
watch O
by O
the O
bedside O
of O
her O
father O
while O
she O
sought O
the O
old O
woman O
mentioned O
by O
Dr. O
Crockley S-PERSON
. O
Reluctantly O
, O
and O
unresistingly O
she O
consented O
, O
and O
giving O
a O
look O
at O
the O
bed O
that O
seemed O
to O
wring O
her O
very O
heart O
, O
she O
quitted O
the O
room O
, O
leaving O
Michael B-PERSON
Armstrong E-PERSON
alone O
with O
the O
motionless O
mass O
of O
still O
living O
clay O
, O
before O
which O
he O
had O
so O
often O
trembled O
. O
How O
strangely O
eventful O
had O
been O
the O
interval O
between O
those O
well O
- O
remembered O
days O
, O
and O
the O
one O
actually O
present O
with O
him O
! O
How O
extraordinary O
the O
change O
in O
the O
circumstances O
of O
both O
parties O
! O
It O
was O
not O
triumph O
, O
but O
it O
was O
thankfulness O
, O
which O
Michael S-PERSON
felt O
, O
as O
the O
sense O
of O
this O
came O
fully O
upon O
him O
during O
these O
moments O
of O
profound O
stillness O
| | O
and O
the O
result O
of O
all O
the O
moving O
thoughts O
that O
crowded O
upon O
his O
mind O
was O
an O
earnest O
prayer O
to O
Heaven O
that O
he O
might O
never O
be O
placed O
in O
any O
circumstances O
likely O
to O
harden O
his O
heart O
, O
and O
make O
him O
the O
cause O
of O
suffering O
to O
others O
, O
— O
a O
fearful O
and O
a O
dreadful O
crime O
, O
which O
he O
felt O
, O
as O
he O
gazed O
with O
trembling O
awe O
on O
the O
sunken O
features O
of O
the O
living O
corse O
before O
him O
, O
must O
in O
the O
sight O
of O
God O
be O
held O
as O
one O
of O
the O
most O
daring O
rebellion O
to O
his O
heavenly O
will O
of O
which O
man O
is O
capable O
. O
Betty B-PERSON
Parker E-PERSON
knew O
little O
of O
the O
intensity O
of O
Martha's S-PERSON
pertinacious O
love O
for O
her O
unworthy O
parent O
, O
if O
she O
fancied O
that O
her O
very O
reasonable O
remonstrance O
would O
produce O
any O
effect O
. O
Martha S-PERSON
attempted O
not O
even O
to O
answer O
it O
, O
but O
placing O
herself O
in O
a O
chair O
close O
beside O
the O
bed O
, O
remained O
nearly O
as O
motionless O
as O
the O
faintly O
breathing O
figure O
that O
lay O
upon O
it O
. O
Poor O
Michael S-PERSON
knew O
not O
too O
well O
what O
he O
ought O
to O
do O
next O
. O
He O
felt O
that O
he O
was O
useless O
there O
| | O
he O
knew O
that O
he O
should O
be O
stared O
at O
, O
as O
a O
very O
incomprehensible O
intruder O
, O
if O
he O
descended O
to O
the O
offices O
. O
Yet O
he O
remembered O
that O
his O
benefactress O
had O
bid O
him O
not O
to O
go O
, O
and O
he O
could O
not O
have O
felt O
himself O
more O
strongly O
bound O
to O
remain O
, O
had O
the O
crime O
of O
high O
treason O
been O
involved O
in O
his O
departure O
. O
Yet O
there O
was O
something O
in O
the O
stupid O
puzzled O
look O
with O
which O
Betty B-PERSON
Parker E-PERSON
regarded O
him O
, O
that O
vexed O
his O
spirit O
. O
He O
was O
conscious O
that O
he O
had O
no O
business O
in O
that O
room O
, O
and O
therefore O
at O
such O
a O
moment O
he O
ought O
not O
to O
be O
there O
. O
After O
a O
few O
moments O
of O
reflection O
he O
approached O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
and O
making O
so O
profound O
a O
reverence O
as O
to O
convince O
Betty S-PERSON
, O
that O
let O
him O
be O
who O
he O
would O
, O
he O
was O
a O
very O
well O
- O
behaved O
young O
gentleman O
, O
he O
said O
, O
" O
I O
will O
now O
, O
Miss O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
go O
to O
the O
inn O
for O
an B-TIME
hour E-TIME
or O
two S-CARDINAL
, O
and O
then O
return O
to O
take O
your O
orders O
. O
" O
A O
look O
of O
gratitude O
was O
all O
her O
reply O
, O
and O
Michael S-PERSON
departed O
. O
It O
was O
three B-TIME
o'clock I-TIME
in I-TIME
the I-TIME
afternoon E-TIME
when O
he O
entered O
the O
little O
inn O
, O
where O
the O
postboy O
, O
who O
had O
driven O
him O
from O
Fairly B-TIME
in I-TIME
the I-TIME
morning E-TIME
, O
was O
still O
waiting O
his O
orders O
. O
" O
I O
cannot O
tell O
you O
yet O
, O
my O
lad O
, O
when O
I O
shall O
be O
ready O
to O
return O
, O
" O
he O
replied O
, O
in O
answer O
to O
the O
boy's O
questionings O
. O
" O
It's O
all O
one O
to O
me O
, O
master O
, O
" O
said O
the O
driver O
. O
" O
In O
course O
I O
shall O
be O
paid O
accordingly O
. O
" O
" O
Certainly O
you O
will O
, O
" O
returned O
Michael S-PERSON
: O
and O
he O
was O
then O
left O
to O
eat O
his O
solitary O
dinner O
with O
what O
appetite O
he O
might O
. O
For O
three B-TIME
long I-TIME
melancholy I-TIME
hours E-TIME
he O
employed O
himself O
in O
pacing O
backwards O
and O
forwards O
on O
the O
high O
- O
road O
before O
the O
little O
inn O
, O
and O
was O
beginning O
to O
think O
that O
time O
enough O
had O
elapsed O
to O
justify O
his O
returning O
to O
inquire O
how O
matters O
were O
going O
on O
at O
Dowling B-FAC
Lodge E-FAC
, O
when O
the O
sound O
of O
a O
carriage O
approaching O
as O
it O
seemed O
from O
the O
park O
- O
gates O
, O
cause O
him O
to O
stop O
abruptly O
to O
listen O
, O
and O
to O
look O
. O
The O
equipage O
that O
drew O
near O
was O
a O
handsome O
travelling O
- O
carriage O
, O
though O
its O
appearance O
was O
considerably O
disfigured O
by O
the O
prodigious O
quantity O
of O
luggage O
, O
which O
was O
fastened O
by O
ropes O
and O
chains O
to O
every O
part O
of O
it O
. O
The O
imperial O
only O
formed O
the O
foundation O
for O
a O
pyramid O
of O
trunks O
and O
bandboxes O
, O
which O
were O
piled O
upon O
it O
. O
The O
servant's O
- O
seat O
behind O
was O
loaded O
to O
its O
very O
utmost O
capacity O
with O
more O
trunks O
and O
bandboxes O
, O
while O
, O
chained O
below O
it O
, O
was O
a O
massive O
coffer O
, O
that O
looked O
very O
like O
a O
plate O
- O
chest O
, O
having O
suspended O
round O
its O
sides O
, O
bundles O
, O
baskets O
, O
and O
bags O
innumerable O
. O
Nor O
was O
the O
interior O
by O
any O
means O
reserved O
for O
live O
lumber O
alone O
, O
for O
although O
the O
rigid O
figures O
of O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa I-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
, O
and O
her O
waiting O
- O
woman O
, O
Saunderson S-PERSON
, O
were O
visible O
in O
the O
midst O
, O
it O
appeared O
to O
be O
crammed O
with O
every O
imaginable O
species O
of O
property O
which O
such O
a O
conveyance O
could O
transport O
. O
Michael S-PERSON
watched O
the O
overloaded O
vehicle O
roll O
by O
with O
great O
satisfaction O
. O
" O
Whatever O
happens O
, O
" O
thought O
he O
, O
" O
Miss O
Martha S-PERSON
must O
be O
better O
without O
her O
. O
" O
Relieved O
by O
knowing O
that O
he O
should O
not O
again O
run O
the O
risk O
of O
encountering O
her O
delectable O
ladyship O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
immediately O
took O
his O
way O
to O
the O
magnificent O
mansion O
she O
had O
forsaken O
, O
and O
perceiving O
that O
the O
hall O
- O
doors O
stood O
wide O
open O
, O
preferred O
passing O
through O
them O
to O
encountering O
again O
the O
motley O
throng O
that O
had O
taken O
possession O
of O
the O
offices O
. O
But O
instead O
of O
finding O
this O
portion O
of O
the O
house O
as O
quiet O
and O
forsaken O
as O
he O
had O
left O
it O
, O
he O
was O
startled O
by O
hearing O
, O
as O
he O
mounted O
the O
steps O
of O
the O
stately O
portico O
, O
a O
multitude O
of O
voices O
in O
violent O
altercation O
. O
At O
first S-ORDINAL
he O
felt O
disposed O
to O
turn O
away O
and O
seek O
another O
entrance O
, O
but O
the O
vehemence O
of O
the O
sounds O
he O
heard O
excited O
his O
curiosity O
, O
and O
he O
went O
on O
. O
Instead O
of O
one S-CARDINAL
, O
half B-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
a- I-CARDINAL
dozen E-CARDINAL
strangers O
might O
have O
entered O
without O
running O
any O
risk O
of O
having O
their O
right O
there O
challenged O
| | O
so O
great O
was O
the O
confusion O
that O
reigned O
| | O
and O
Michael S-PERSON
might O
have O
passed O
up O
the O
great O
stairs O
, O
and O
into O
the O
chamber O
which O
it O
was O
his O
purpose O
to O
visit O
, O
without O
any O
difficulty O
. O
But O
he O
was O
prevented O
from O
taking O
immediate O
advantage O
of O
this O
, O
by O
hearing O
words O
which O
excited O
new O
fears O
for O
the O
unfortunate O
Martha S-PERSON
| | O
and O
, O
ere O
he O
had O
listened O
many O
minutes O
, O
he O
became O
aware O
that O
a O
new O
creditor O
had O
reached O
the O
lodge O
after O
he O
left O
it O
, O
who O
had O
come O
, O
armed O
with O
proper O
authority O
, O
to O
arrest O
the O
knight O
, O
dead O
or O
alive O
. O
Nor O
did O
the O
discussion O
of O
this O
event O
cause O
all O
the O
uproar O
| | O
for O
the O
agents O
of O
the O
parties O
who O
had O
previously O
sent O
in O
the O
execution O
were O
threatening O
with O
all O
sorts O
of O
punishment O
, O
several O
of O
the O
servants O
, O
whom O
they O
accused O
of O
having O
been O
bribed O
to O
assist O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa E-PERSON
in O
the O
removal O
of O
many O
valuables O
which O
she O
had O
no O
right O
to O
take O
. O
It O
was O
not O
this O
part O
of O
the O
tumult O
, O
however O
, O
that O
interested O
him O
| | O
and O
, O
having O
obtained O
but O
too O
clearly O
the O
information O
that O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
was O
arrested O
, O
he O
once O
more O
sought O
for O
the O
unhappy O
Martha S-PERSON
in O
the O
dismal O
chamber O
where O
he O
had O
left O
her O
. O
And O
there O
he O
found O
her O
| | O
but O
with O
such O
frightful O
adjuncts O
to O
her O
natural O
grief O
, O
that O
the O
state O
of O
quiet O
decent O
sorrow O
in O
which O
he O
had O
left O
her O
, O
seemed O
a O
condition O
positively O
enviable O
compared O
to O
that O
in O
which O
he O
found O
her O
now O
. O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
had O
breathed O
his O
last O
, O
and O
the O
corpse O
was O
already O
arranged O
with O
decency O
upon O
its O
stately O
bed O
| | O
but O
, O
on O
each O
side O
of O
it O
stood O
an O
officer O
, O
whose O
duty O
it O
was O
to O
violate O
by O
their O
presence O
the O
solemn O
sanctity O
of O
that O
dismal O
chamber O
, O
and O
to O
prevent O
the O
body's O
being O
carried O
to O
the O
grave O
, O
till O
the O
claims O
of O
their O
employer O
were O
satisfied O
. O
In O
front O
of O
her O
father's O
corpse O
, O
with O
her O
troubled O
eyes O
( O
no O
longer O
bathed O
in O
the O
healing O
dew O
of O
natural O
sorrow O
) O
, O
turning O
from O
it O
to O
its O
rude O
guardians O
, O
and O
back O
again O
to O
all O
that O
was O
left O
of O
the O
sinful O
being O
she O
had O
so O
fondly O
, O
blindly O
loved O
, O
— O
stood O
the O
wretched O
daughter O
, O
so O
sad O
a O
spectacle O
of O
woe O
, O
that O
it O
was O
evident O
the O
men O
themselves O
turned O
their O
hard O
eyes O
studiously O
away O
, O
because O
they O
felt O
a O
pang O
of O
pity O
as O
they O
looked O
upon O
her O
. O
away O
, O
you O
must O
indeed O
. O
" O
The O
only O
answer O
that O
poor O
Martha S-PERSON
gave O
, O
was O
forcibly O
shaking O
off O
the O
hand O
that O
held O
her O
, O
and O
then O
pointing O
, O
first S-ORDINAL
to O
her O
father's O
body O
, O
and O
afterwards O
to O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
unseemly O
attendants O
who O
stood O
beside O
it O
. O
" O
It O
is O
no O
use O
, O
young O
man O
, O
to O
strive O
with O
her O
, O
" O
said O
Betty S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
still O
occupied O
in O
completing O
some O
of O
her O
lugubrious O
operations O
about O
the O
bed O
: O
" O
I O
know O
her O
better O
than O
you O
do O
. O
She O
will O
stay O
here O
watching O
him O
till O
she O
is O
as O
dead O
as O
he O
is O
, O
rather O
than O
go O
away O
, O
and O
leave O
his O
body O
to O
be O
tended O
by O
such O
as O
those O
. O
" O
For O
a O
moment O
Michael S-PERSON
really O
felt O
all O
the O
enervating O
effects O
of O
despair O
, O
and O
stood O
perfectly O

But O
, O
as O
the O
old O
woman O
pursued O
her O
ghastly O
occupation O
, O
she O
went O
muttering O
on O
, O
expatiating O
on O
the O
sinful O

unchristian O
outrage O
that O
was O
thus O
committed O

the O
friendly O
defender O

Mr. O

: O
— O
for O
it O
was O
at O

demanded O
old O
Betty S-PERSON
with O
a O
sneer O

" O

replied O
the O
man O

To O
all O
this O
poor O
Martha S-PERSON
appeared O
not O
to O
pay O
the O
slightest O
attention O
, O

, O
in O
truth O
, O
neither O
understood O

heard O
a O
word O

it O

but O
Michael S-PERSON
did O
, O
and O
with O
sudden O
animation O
stepped O
up O
to O
the O
man O
who O
had O
spoken O
, O
and O
whispered O
in O
his O
ear O
, O
" O
Perhaps O
we O
may O
be O
able O
to O
settle O
this O

out O

" O
Neither O

the O

in O
a O
wondrously O
short O
space O
of O
time O

of O

we O

will O
be O
best O

at O

My O

it O

The O
consequence O
of O
this O
packet O
was O
another O
metamorphosis O
on O
the O
part O
of O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
" O
She O
shall O
not O
think O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
addressing O
Mr. O
Bell S-PERSON
, O
" O
that O
my O
respect O
for O
her O
is O
lessened O
because O
her O
fortune O
has O
fallen O
. O
I O
will O
wait O
upon O
her O
with O
faithful O
duty O
and O
most O
grateful O
affection O
: O
but O
she O
was O
born O
in O
a O
palace O
, O
and O
I O
in O
a O
cabin O
| | O
and O
I O
will O
not O
, O
especially O
just O
now O
, O
obtrude O
myself O
upon O
her O
as O
a O
companion O
. O
As O
her O
servant O
I O
hope O
I O
may O
be O
useful O
to O
her O
, O
and O
it O
is O
in O
that O
capacity O
that O
I O
shall O
attend O
her O
. O
" O
felt O
to O
be O
very O
unfitting O
to O
her O
situation O
. O
Her O
conscience O
, O
however O
, O
could O
not O
reproach O
her O
for O
this O
, O
for O
most O
assuredly O
she O
could O
not O
help O
it O
. O
Many O
were O
the O
letters O
, O
and O
various O
the O
mementos O
of O
affection O
, O
intrusted O
by O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Bell S-PERSON
to O
the O
care O
of O
Michael S-PERSON
for O
their O
dearly O
- O
beloved O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton E-PERSON
. O
Nor O
was O
there O
an O
individual O
of O
whose O
welfare O
he O
thought O
it O
would O
please O
her O
to O
hear O
, O
whom O
he O
did O
not O
visit O
to O
receive O
their O
loving O
blessings O
for O
the O
benefactress O
who O
, O
notwithstanding O
her O
wide O
wanderings O
, O
had O
never O
failed O
to O
remember O
the O
wants O
of O
all O
who O
had O
faithfully O
served O
her O
, O
or O
in O
any O
way O
become O
dependent O
on O
her O
bounty O
. O
These O
duties O
completed O
, O
and O
a O
farewell O
of O
most O
grateful O
affection O
uttered O
to O
the O
amiable O
clergyman O
and O
his O
excellent O
wife O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
set O
off O
upon O
his O
long O
journey O
with O
feelings O
of O
hope O
, O
joy O
, O
confidence O
, O
fear O
, O
diffidence O
, O
and O
trembling O
affection O
, O
— O
all O
so O
strongly O
mixed O
together O
in O
his O
bosom O
that O
, O
had O
his O
life O
depended O
on O
it O
, O
he O
could O
not O
himself O
have O
told O
which O
it O
was O
that O
most O
frequently O
preponderated O
. O
Yet O
, O
altogether O
, O
his O
state O
of O
mind O
was O
very O
delightful O
: O
the O
novelty O
and O
excitement O
of O
journeying O
, O
so O
pregnant O
of O
enjoyment O
to O
most O
of O
us O
, O
was O
most O
especially O
captivating O
to O
him O
, O
whose O
education O
had O
been O
little O
more O
than O
the O
unchecked O
development O
of O
imagination O
, O
and O
of O
that O
keen O
observation O
of O
all O
surrounding O
objects O
which O
his O
shepherd O
life O
had O
taught O
him O
. O
The O
first S-ORDINAL
painful O
interruption O
to O
the O
state O
of O
felicity O
, O
arose O
from O
his O
finding O
himself O
under O
the O
necessity O
of O
confessing O
to O
Martha S-PERSON
that O
he O
had O
no O
more O
money O
wherewith O
to O
pay O
their O
way O
. O
Aware O
that O
in O
the O
performance O
of O
his O
self O
- O
appointed O
office O
Michael S-PERSON
would O
have O
to O
pay O
every O
thing O
, O
and O
keep O
a O
regular O
account O
of O
it O
| | O
and O
aware O
also O
that O
the O
money O
he O
had O
received O
from O
her O
would O
enable O
him O
to O
do O
this O
, O
without O
giving O
him O
the O
additional O
trouble O
of O
daily S-DATE
settlements O
with O
her O
, O
she O
had O
merely O
said O
, O
a O
minute O
or O
two S-CARDINAL
before O
they O
set O
off O
, O
" O
You O
will O
be O
kind O
enough O
to O
be O
my O
banker O

the O
journey O

accounts O

end O

it O

For O
just B-DATE
one I-DATE
week E-DATE
from O
the O
day O
of O
their O
leaving O
Fairly O
, O
he O
was O
able O
to O
do O
this O
| | O
but O
then O
the O
little O
remnant O
of O
his O
treasure O
failed O
him O
, O
and O
great O
as O
was O
his O
repugnance O
to O
the O
measure O
, O
he O
was O
compelled O
by O
dire O
necessity O
to O
confess O
that O
nearly O
the O
whole O
of O
her O
generous O
gift O
had O
gone O
to O
— O
" O
to O
satisfy O
the O
rapacity O
of O
Mr. O
Parsons S-PERSON
. O
" O
It O
would O
be O
hardly O
possible O
for O
one S-CARDINAL
human O
being O
to O
be O
more O
grateful O
to O
another O
than O
poor O
Martha S-PERSON
felt O
to O
her O
young O
attendant O
after O
this O
disclosure O
. O
She O
remembered O
the O
agony O
which O
he O
had O
made O
to O
cease O
| | O
she O
remembered O
, O
too O
, O
her O
state O
of O
utter O
incapacity O
even O
to O
comprehend O
, O
and O
still O
less O
to O
avert O
the O
horrors O
that O
surrounded O
her O

of O
all O
Michael's S-PERSON
respectful O
efforts O
to O
induce O
her O
to O
perform O
her O
allotted O
character O
properly O
, O
she O
never O
from O
the B-TIME
hour E-TIME
of O
this O
disclosure O
treated O
him O
otherwise O
than O
as O
a O
dear O
and O
valued O
friend O
. O
and O
this O
was O
his O
very O
natural O
wish O
to O
ascertain O
whether O
Edward S-PERSON
and O
Fanny S-PERSON
would O
recognise O
him O
. O
It O
was O
therefore O
still O
in O
the O
dress O
, O
and O
with O
the O
demeanour O
of O
a O
servant O
, O
that O
the O
poor O
factory O
- O
boy O
, O
now O
become O
a O
tall O
and O
very O
handsome O
young O
man O
, O
armed O
himself O
with O
courage O
to O
enter O
the O
presence O
of O
his O
brother O
, O
and O
once O
more O
to O
draw O
near O
to O
the O
dear O
and O
gentle O
little O
being O
whom O
he O
had O
so O
fondly O
loved O
during O
the O
miserable O
period O
they O
had O
passed O
together O
at O
the B-LOC
Deep I-LOC
Valley E-LOC
. O
It O
had O
been O
previously O
agreed O
between O
himself O
and O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
that O
when O
she O
sent O
for O
him O
, O
it O
should O
be O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
giving O
him O
some O
long O
and O
particular O
instructions O
respecting O
the O
luggage O

was O
to O
get O
from O
the O
custom O

in O
order O
to O
give O
him O
time O
to O
look O
, O
and O
be O
looked O
at O
, O
before O
the O
moment O
of O
discovery O
should O
arrive O
. O
The O
young O
man O
trembled O
like O
an O
aspen O
- O
leaf O
as O
he O
laid O
his O
hand O
upon O
the O
lock O
of O
the O
door O
, O
the O
opening O
of O
which O
would O
bring O
him O
face O
to O
face O
with O
his O
brother O
. O
And O
perchance O
he O
might O
have O
indulged O
in O
a O
longer O
interval O
of O
preparation O
, O
had O
not O
the O
voice O
of O
Martha S-PERSON
distinctly O
pronounced O
the O
words O
" O
Come O
in O
! O
" O
Further O
delay O
was O
out O
of O
the O
question O
| | O
he O
pushed O
forward O
the O
door O
, O
and O
entered O
. O
The O
first S-ORDINAL
figure O
that O
his O
eyes O
fell O
upon O
was O
that O
of O
a O
young O
lady O
— O
small O
, O
and O
of O
very O
delicate O
proportions O
— O
whose O
head O
, O
which O
was O
hanging O
over O
some O
employment O
as O
the O
door O
opened O
, O
was O
raised O
as O
he O
entered O
, O
displaying O
to O
him O
a O
very O
lovely O
face O
, O
and O
a O
pair O
of O
eyes O
whose O
dark O
brilliance O
almost O
made O
the O
beholder O
wink O
. O
Could O
that O
be O
Fanny B-PERSON
Fletcher E-PERSON
? O
No O
. O
Yet O
that O
it O
should O
be O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
seemed O
more O
impossible O
still O
. O
Like O
all O
young O
people O
who O
have O
been O
separated O
from O
some O
one O
considerably O
older O
than O
themselves O
, O
ever O
since O
the O
period O
when O
this O
difference O
made O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
them O
appear O
fully O
grown O
, O
while O
the O
other O
was O
still O
a O
child O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
fancied O
that O
in O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
he O
should O
see O
an O
elderly O
person O
, O
no O
more O
like O
a O
pretty O
girl O
, O
than O
he O
was O
himself O
. O
But O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton E-PERSON
had O
not O
fully O
completed O
her O
twenty B-DATE
- I-DATE
ninth I-DATE
year E-DATE

and O
happening O
, O
moreover O
, O
to O
be O
very O
peculiarly O
young O
- O
looking O
both O
in O
face O
and O
figure O
, O
it O
was O
not O
very O
wonderful O
that O
he O
should O
doubt O
of O
her O
identity O

for O
it O
was O
in O
truth O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton E-PERSON
, O
and O
no O
other O
, O
whose O
bright O
and O
laughing O
loveliness O
made O
him O
turn O
his O
admiring O
eyes O
away O
, O
in O
search O
of O
something O
dearer O
, O
though O
not O
more O
beautiful O
. O
operation O
with O
the O
lock O
of O
the O
door O
. O
Martha S-PERSON
played O
her O
part O
admirably O
, O
appearing O
to O
be O
the O
most O
exceedingly O
particular O
young O
lady O
, O
about O
boxes O
, O
bags O
, O
and O
desks O
, O
that O
ever O
travelled O
. O
" O
Remember O
, O
I O
beg O
, O
" O
she O
said O
, O
" O
that O
you O
see O
yourself O
to O
the O
opening O
of O
every O
package O
. O
Don't O
let O
them O
touch O
a O
single O
article O
that O
you O
do O
not O
watch O
the O
whole O
time O
| | O
and O
be O
sure O
that O
every O
thing O
is O
locked O
again O
— O
and O
on O
no O
account O
forget O
the O
covers O
, O
or O
mismatch O
them O
— O
and O
remember O
particularly O
— O
" O
et O
cætera O
, O
et O
cætera O
, O
and O
so O
she O
ran O
on O
at O
the O
imminent O
risk O
of O
being O
classed O
by O
her O
clever O
friend O
Mary S-PERSON
as O
the O
veriest O
fidget O
that O
ever O
arrived O
to O
bore O
a O
peaceable O
household O
and O
all O
in O
order O
to O
give O
her O
poor O
companion O
time O
to O
recover O
himself O
, O
and O
see O
distinctly O
what O
was O
before O
him O
. O
But O
Michael S-PERSON
could O
not O
recover O
himself O
, O
nor O
could O
he O
even O
find O
courage O
to O
look O
about O
him O
. O
It O
was O
a O
large O
saloon O
that O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
occupied O
, O
and O
the O
agitated O
young O
man O
rather O
felt O
that O
there O
was O
a O
gentleman O
occupied O
with O
books O
and O
papers O
at O
a O
distant O
table O
, O
than O
saw O
him O
. O
Yet O
to O
see O
him O
he O
was O
determined O
, O
if O
his O
life O
were O
to O
be O
the O
forfeit O
| | O
and O
turning O
his O
head O
with O
an O
eye O
as O
troubled O
as O
that O
of O
Hamlet S-PERSON
, O
when O
tremblingly O
following O
his O
father's O
spirit O
, O
he O
stood O
at O
last O
with O
clasped O
hands O
, O
protruded O
head O
, O
and O
features O
almost O
convulsed O
with O
emotion O
, O
when O
he O
had O
an O
uninterrupted O
view O
of O
his O
brother's O
clam O
and O
beautiful O
countenance O
. O
Edward S-PERSON
was O
very O
busily O
employed O
, O
and O
unconsciously O
submitted O
himself O
to O
this O
examination O
without O
raising O
his O
eyes O
, O
or O
moving O
in O
any O
way O
| | O
but O
Miss O
Brotherton's S-PERSON
ear O
caught O
something O
like O
a O
sob O
from O
the O
silent O
object O
of O
all O
Martha's S-PERSON
eloquence O
, O
and O
suddenly O
looking O
up O
perceived O
Michael S-PERSON
in O
the O
attitude O
described O
, O
but O
stealthily O
, O
and O
perhaps O
unknowingly O
approaching O
Edward's S-PERSON
table O
, O
while O
the O
tears O
he O
could O
no O
longer O
check O
, O
rolled O
down O
his O
manly O
cheek O
. O
There O
are O
some O
individuals O
of O
the O
human O
family O
gifted O
with O
such O
quickness O
of O
perception O
, O
and O
rapidity O
of O
inference O
, O
that O
their O
faculties O
act O
with O
the O
certainty O
of O
instinct O
, O
and O
the O
brilliancy O
of O
inspiration O
. O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
was O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
those O
| | O
and O
after O
looking O
for O
a B-TIME
minute E-TIME
or O
two S-CARDINAL
at O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
quite O
as O
earnestly O
as O
Michael S-PERSON
looked O
at O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
she O
sprung O
from O
the O
sofa O
, O
pushed O
the O
table O
that O
stood O
before O
it O
with O
such O
violence O
from O
her O
as O
nearly O
to O
overset O
it O
, O
and O
rushing O
forward O
laid O
her O
hand O
upon O
his O
arm O
, O
exclaiming O
, O
" O
For O
mercy's O
sake O
tell O
me O
young O
man O
, O
who O
you O
are O
, O
and O
where O
you O
come O
from O
? O
" O
On O
hearing O
these O
words O
in O
a O
voice O
unusually O
loud O
and O
agitated O
, O
Edward S-PERSON
rose O
hastily O
from O
his O
seat O
, O
and O
approached O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
as O
if O
to O
protect O
her O
from O
some O
threatened O
danger O
| | O
but O
turning O
towards O
him O
, O
she O
held O
up O
her O
hand O
as O
if O
to O
prevent O
his O
hostile O
approach O
, O
and O
said O
, O
" O
Stay O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
stay O
! O
Look O
at O
him O
! O
Good O
Heaven O
! O
Look O
at O
him O
, O
dearest O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
and O
tell O
me O
who O
he O
is O
like O
! O
" O
distracted O
eyes O
fixed O
themselves O
on O
the O
agitated O
face O
before O
him O
as O
if O
they O
would O
read O
in O
it O
the O
history O
of O
years S-DATE
. O
" O
Edward S-PERSON
! O
— O
Teddy S-PERSON
! O
" O
cried O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
opening O
his O
arms O
, O
and O
making O
a O
step O
in O
advance O
. O
In O
the O
next O
instant O
the O
brothers O
were O
locked O
in O
each O
other's O
arms O
, O
and O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
drew O
back O
, O
and O
gazed O
upon O
them O
from O
a O
distance O
as O
if O
the O
very O
ground O
that O
sustained O
hearts O
under O
the O
influence O
of O
such O
feelings O
was O
holy O
— O
while O
Fanny B-PERSON
Fletcher E-PERSON
, O
rose O
and O
sat O
down O
, O
and O
rose O
again O
, O
checking O
the O
feeling O
that O
would O
have O
sent O
her O
to O
stretch O
forth O
a O
hand O
of O
welcome O
to O
her O
old O
friend O
, O
by O
telling O
herself O
that O
no O
hand O
, O
no O
voice O
but O
Edward's S-PERSON
could O
be O
cared O
for O
then O
. O
And O
perhaps O
she O
was O
right O
| | O
for O
it O
is O
certain O
that O
for O
several B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
, O
neither O
Edward S-PERSON
nor O
Michael S-PERSON
were O
fully O
conscious O
where O
they O
were O
, O
nor O
who O
they O
might O
be O
that O
were O
near O
them O
. O
Once O
and O
again O
each O
beating O
heart O
was O
strained O
against O
the O
brother O
heart O
, O
and O
then O
, O
their O
right O
hands O
clasped O
, O
and O
the O
left O
placed O
, O
each O
on O
the O
other's O
shoulder O
, O
" O
They O
fell O
to O
such O
perusal O
of O
the O
face O
, O
" O
that O
now O
, O
after O
eight B-DATE
cruel I-DATE
years E-DATE
of O
absence O
, O
was O
once O
more O
beaming O
with O
love O
and O
sympathy O
before O
their O
eyes O
, O
that O
it O
must O
have O
been O
a O
very O
heartless O
and O
soulless O
being O
who O
should O
have O
come O
between O
them O
. O
Though O
such O
a O
history O
as O
Michael's S-PERSON
might O
well O
have O
occupied O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
one E-CARDINAL
long O
summer's O
day O
in O
the O
telling O
, O
to O
ears O
so O
greedy O
of O
every O
circumstance O
connected O
with O
it O
as O
were O
those O
of O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
yet O
it O
is O
wonderful O
how O
very O
short O
a O
time O
sufficed O
to O
point O
out O
the O
keystone O
of O
the O
arch O
, O
upon O
which O
the O
whole O
wonderful O
fabric O
hung O
, O
and O
then O
it O
was O
that O
Fanny B-PERSON
Fletcher's E-PERSON
voice O
was O
heard O
exclaiming O
in O
a O
burst O
of O
uncontrollable O
emotion O
, O
" O
Then O
it O
was O
I O
that O
caused O
it O
all O
! O
Oh O
! O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
, O
it O
was O
I O
who O
kept O
him O
in O
that O
horrid O
place O
for O
years S-DATE

Had O
I O
not O
told O
you O

your O

me O

Oh O
! O
how O
can O
he O
ever O
forgive O
me O

" O
This O
was O
uttered O
with O
such O
agitated O
rapidity O
, O
that O
though O
there O
was O
more O
than O
one O
present O
, O
who O
would O
have O
been O
ready O
enough O
to O
contradict O
the O
self O
- O
accusing O
statement O
, O
she O
gave O
them O
no O
time O
for O
it O
. O
But O
it O
sufficed O
to O
draw O
Michael S-PERSON
from O
the O
side O
of O
his O
brother O
, O
and O
to O
place O
him O
at O
hers O

and O
though O
this O
terrible O
thought O
drew O
a O
shower O
of O
tears O
from O
Fanny's S-PERSON
eyes O
, O
notwithstanding O
the O
exceeding O
happiness O
which O
was O
at O
the O
very O
same O
moment O
throbbing O
at O
her O
heart O

it O
may O
be O
that O
there O
could O
not O
have O
been O
found O
a O
more O
effectual O
mode O
of O
at O
once O
bringing O
back O
the O
long O
- O
parted O
friends O
to O
the O
same O
tone O
of O
familiar O
intercourse O
in O
which O
they O
had O
parted O
, O
as O
this O
sincere O
self O
- O
recrimination O
on O
one S-CARDINAL
part O
, O
and O
the O
warm O
pleading O
against O
its O
injustice O
, O
on O
the O
other O

For O
some B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
this O
lasted O
without O
being O
interrupted O
by O
a O
word O
from O
any O
one O

for O
both O
Mary S-PERSON

Edward S-PERSON
found O
, O
sufficient O
occupation O
in O
looking O
at O
them O
both O

then O
exchanging O
expressive O
glances O
of O
thanksgiving O

happiness O
with O
each O
other O

But O
at O
length O
, O
upon O
Fanny's S-PERSON
saying O
with O
a O
fresh O
burst O
of O
tears O
, O
" O
Oh O

" O
Upon O
her O
saying O
this O
, O
the O
happy O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton E-PERSON
pushed O
a O
low O
tabouret O
before O
the O
reunited O
friends O

seating O
herself O
upon O
it O
, O
took O
Fanny's S-PERSON
hand O
in O
hers O

said O

" O
If O
you O
would O
not O
cry O
about O
it O

my O
Fanny S-PERSON

should O
think O
it O
was O
a O
mighty O

exhibition O
of O
true O
feeling O

false O
argument O

all O

ourselves O

laugh O
you O

your O
sophistry O

confusion O

you O
refused O

Deep B-LOC

firmly O
believing O

dead O

was O
of O
them O

If O
a O
thought O
of O
the O
future O
glanced O
athwart O
the O
delicious O
present O
, O
it O
came O
accompanied O
by O
a O
buoyant O
consciousness O
that O
there O
was O
that O
within O
him O
which O
would O
enable O
him O
to O
redeem O
lost O
time O
, O
and O
that O
whatever O
those O
he O
loved O
wished O
him O
to O
be O
, O
THAT O
he O
should O
have O
power O
to O
become O
. O
Nor O
was O
an O
answering O
confidence O
wanting O
in O
those O
who O
wearied O
not O
of O
gazing O
at O
his O
bright O
, O
expressive O
features O
, O
and O
his O
noble O
form O
. O
Fanny S-PERSON
thought O
that O
he O
was O
exactly O
every O
thing O
she O
would O
have O
dreamed O
he O
must O
be O
, O
had O
she O
ventured O
to O
dream O
that O
he O
existed O
at O
all O
. O
Marry O
thought O
that O
she O
read O
capacity O
which O
promised O
power O
to O
become O
all O
that O
Edward S-PERSON
could O
wish O
him O
to O
be O
— O
and O
she O
was O
not O
disposed O
to O
wish O
for O
more O
— O
and O
Edward S-PERSON
himself O
thought O
and O
felt O
that O
had O
he O
power O
to O
choose O
a O
brother O
from O
among O
all O
the O
nations O
of O
the O
earth O
, O
and O
the O
noblest O
of O
them O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
would O
have O
been O
the O
one O
he O
would O
have O
selected O
. O
" O
And O
where O
is O
my O
dear O
, O
good O
Tremlett S-PERSON
? O
" O
said O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
. O
" O
In O
the O
midst O
of O
all O
this O
rare O
felicity O
she O
must O
not O
be O
left O
out O
. O
She O
has O
shared O
our O
mourning O
for O
your O
loss O
, O
dear O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
and O
shame O
it O
were O
she O
should O
not O
share O
our O
joy O
at O
finding O
you O
. O
" O
" O
Shall O
I O
go O
and O
call O
her O
hither O
? O
" O
cried O
Fanny S-PERSON
, O
rising O
. O
" O
" O
No O
! O
that O
you O
shall O
not O
, O
Fanny S-PERSON
, O
" O
replied O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
. O
" O
I O
will O
not O
trust O
you O
. O
It O
was O
I O
who O
dragged O
the O
dear O
good O
soul O
from O
post O
to O
pillar O
, O
in O
order O
to O
find O
you O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
. O
— O
It O
was O
I O
who O
never O
let O
her O
know O
rest O
, O
night O
nor O
day O
, O
because O
you O
were O
not O
, O
and O
who O
but O
I O
shall O
bring O
her O
the O
glad O
tidings O
of O
your O
restoration O
? O
" O
But O
truly O
delighted O
as O
was O
Mary B-PERSON
Brothrton E-PERSON
at O
the O
idea O
of O
the O
pleasure O
which O
she O
well O
knew O
this O
unlooked O
- O
for O
arrival O
would O
cause O
her O
old O
friend O
, O
she O
would O
not O
let O
her O
taste O
it O
without O
the O
addition O
of O
a O
little O
mystification O
| | O
and O
accordingly O
she O
led O
her O
into O
the O
room O
which O
contained O
the O
happy O
party O
, O
with O
no O
other O
preparation O
than O
telling O
her O
that O
there O
was O
a O
young O
Englishman S-NORP
in O
the O
saloon O
, O
to O
whom O
she O
must O
come O
and O
be O
introduced O
, O
because O
he O
was O
a O
countryman O
. O
To O
this O
the O
tractable O
old O
lady O
agreed O
, O
without O
testifying O
any O
very O
lively O
emotion O
| | O
but O
when O
she O
had O
got O
into O
the O
midst O
of O
the O
group O
, O
and O
witnessed O
the O
general O
exaltation O
of O
spirits O
which O
seemed O
to O
possess O
them O
all O
, O
after O
looking O
and O
listening O
for O
a O
little O
while O
she O
could O
not O
help O
whispering O
to O
Fanny S-PERSON
, O
" O
Do O
you O
know O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
who O
that O
young O
man O
is O
? O
I O
never O
saw O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
— O
no O
! O
nor O
Mr. O
Armstrong S-PERSON
either O
— O
seem O
to O
be O
so O
extraordinarily O
intimate O
with O
any O
one O
before O
, O
just O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
sight O
. O
" O
In O
reply O
to O
this O
Fanny S-PERSON
only O
hid O
her O
face O
, O
and O
laughed O
, O
for O
she O
dared O
not O
trust O
her O
voice O
to O
give O
the O
information O
required O
. O
" O
How O
very O
odd O
, O
" O
murmured O
the O
old O
lady O
, O
drawing O
her O
knitting O
from O
her O
bag O
. O
" O
It O
is O
very O
odd O
, O
Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
, O
very O
odd O
indeed O
, O
" O
said O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
" O
there O
is O
no O
denying O
it O
. O
But O
the O
fact O
is O
, O
that O
Mr. O
Armstrong S-PERSON
has O
taken O
such O
an O
extraordinary O
fancy O
to O
this O
young O
man O
, O
that O
I O
really O
think O
I O
shall O
be O
obliged O
to O
ask O
him O
to O
live O
with O
us O
. O
There O
will O
be O
plenty O
of O
room O
, O
you O
know O
, O
in O
my O
Rhenish S-NORP
castle O
. O
" O
The O
old O
lady O
said O
not O
a O
word O
in O
reply O
, O
but O
she O
looked O
puzzled O
, O
and O
vexed O
, O
and O
shook O
her O
head O
, O
as O
much O
as O
to O
say O
that O
it O
was O
not O
like O
her O
young O
mistress O
to O
talk O
such O
nonsense O
as O
that O
. O
So O
in O
her O
own O
defence O
Mary S-PERSON
was O
obliged O
to O
explain O
the O
mystery O
, O
and O
as O
happy O
an O
old O
woman O
was O
nurse O
Tremlett S-PERSON
, O
as O
she O
looked O
and O
listened O
, O
as O
ever O
tasted O
joy O
from O
the O
contemplation O
of O
it O
in O
others O

Delightful O

mind O
to O
all O
that O
shared O
it O

it O

Michael S-PERSON
was O
too O
much O
in O
earnest O
in O
his O
dread O
of O
being O
a O
burden O
upon O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
to O
permit O
many O
days O
to O
pass O
before O
he O
begged O
her O
to O
let O
him O
converse O
with O
her O
for O
a O
few O
moments O
in O
private O
| | O
and O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
already O
seen O
quite O
enough O
to O
convince O
her O
that O
the O
affection O
which O
Michael S-PERSON
and O
Fanny S-PERSON
had O
conceived O
for O
each O
other O
, O
amidst O
the O
dreary O
misery O
of O
the B-FAC
Deep I-FAC
Valley I-FAC
Mill E-FAC
, O
was O
not O
likely O
to O
be O
forgotten O
in O
the O
gay O
happiness O
of O
Nice S-PERSON
, O
fully O
anticipated O
an O
humble O
confession O
, O
on O
the O
part O
of O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
that O
he O
could O
not O
be O
happy O
without O
her O
permission O
to O
become O
the O
acknowledge O
lover O
of O
her O
charming O
friend O
and O
protégée O
, O
and O
very O
amiable O
, O
frank O
, O
and O
noble O
- O
minded O
, O
did O
she O
consider O
it O
in O
him O
, O
thus O
openly O
to O
avow O
the O
truth O
at O
once O
. O
But O
nothing O
could O
be O
further O
from O
the O
thoughts O
of O
Michael S-PERSON
than O
making O
any O
such O
confession O
as O
this O
| | O
which O
, O
it O
may O
be O
observed O
, O
is O
by O
no O
means O
saying O
that O
his O
heart O
was O
either O
innocent O
or O
unconscious O
of O
the O
presumptuous O
passion O
she O
attributed O
to O
it O
. O
Greatly O
, O
however O
, O
did O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
underrate O
the O
young O
man's O
character O
when O
she O
conceived O
that O
the O
gracious O
favour O
with O
which O
she O
had O
received O
him O
, O
could O
generate O
in O
his O
heart O
a O
wish O
to O
ask O
for O
more O
. O
" O
It O
is O
taking O
a O
great O
liberty O

Mary S-PERSON
? O
and O
till O
I O
had O
taught O
them O
to O
do O
so O
I O
never O
could O
feel O
that O
they O
quite O
understood O
the O
true O
spirit O
of O
my O
attachment O
towards O
them O
, O
or O
the O
mode O
and O
manner O
of O
existence O
which O
I O
have O
imagined O
for O
myself O
, O
and O
which O
must O
have O
fallen O
to O
the O
ground O
, O
if O
I O
had O
found O
them O
incapable O

letting O
me O
be O
to O
them O

all O

wished O

desired O

You O
must O
not O
, O
dearest O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
come O
and O
shake O
this O
perfect O
and O
delightful O
union O
, O
introducing O
forms O
and O
ceremonies O
foreign O
to O
our O
manners O

our O
feelings O

Pray O
do O
not O
look O
so O
grave O

dear O

Promise O
to O
offend O
thus O
no O
more O

I O
will O
cease O

scold O

" O
" O
Dearest O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
! O
" O
said O
Michael S-PERSON
. O
But O
this O
did O
not O
satisfy O
the O
exigeante O
lady O
, O
who O
shook O
her O
head O
, O
and O
held O
up O
her O
finger O
in O
reproof O
. O
" O
Dearest O
Mary S-PERSON
! O
then O
— O
" O
he O
resumed O
, O
colouring O
brightly O
, O
and O
with O
a O
smile O
that O
made O
her O
think O
she O
could O
trace O
a O
family O
likeness O
to O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
" O
the O
greatest O
wish O
I O
have O
on O
earth O
is O
to O
become O
such O
as O
you O
might O
approve O
, O
and O
if O
I O
shrink O
from O
the O
dear O
and O
precious O
familiarity O
which O
must O
make O
Edward S-PERSON
and O
Fanny S-PERSON
so O
happy O
, O
think O
not O
that O
I O
am O
incapable O
of O
loving O
you O
as O
perfectly O
as O
they O
do O
| | O
but O
remember O
, O
dearest O
lady O
! O
that O
however O
humble O
their O
origin O
, O
the O
very O
circumstance O
of O
their O
having O
been O
your O
honoured O
companions O
for O
years S-DATE
, O
is O
of O
itself O
sufficient O
to O
raise O
them O
to O
such O
a O
tone O
of O
thinking O
and O
of O
manners O
, O
as O
may O
, O
in O
some O
sort O
, O
justify O
their O
using O
the O
privilege O
you O
so O
graciously O
afford O
. O
But O
, O
alas O
! O
You O
must O
know O
too O
well O
that O
the O
case O
is O
far O
different O
with O
me O
. O
The O
overflowing O
joy O
of O
our O
first S-ORDINAL
meeting O
, O
naturally O
broke O
down O
, O
as O
it O
were O
, O
all O
inequalities O
, O
all O
boundaries O
, O
and O
I O
certainly O
felt O
, O
and O
perhaps O
spoke O
, O
as O
if O
I O
too O
were O
one O
of O
the O
accomplished O
little O
circle O
that O
might O
call O
this O
earthly O
paradise O
their O
home O
. O
But O
reflection O
will O
come O
, O
most O
generous O
Mary S-PERSON
! O
if O
not O
amidst O
the O
happy O
intoxicating O
moments O
of O
the O
day O
, O
it O
will O
make O
itself O
a O
voice O
in O
the O
quiet O
reasoning O
meditations O
of O
the O
night O
, O
and O
so O
loudly O
has O
this O
voice O
been O
heard O
by O
me O
, O
that O
I O
cannot O
— O
no O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
all O
the O
happiness O
that O
surrounds O
me O
, O
I O
cannot O
live O
on O
thus O
, O
an O
idle O
, O
ignorant O
dependant O
on O
your O
bounty O
. O
" O
circumstances O
, O
all O
notion O
of O
essential O
improvement O
must O
of O
course O
be O
abandoned O
for O
ever O
, O
and O
for O
many O
reasons O
this O
would O
have O
been O
a O
source O
of O
lasting O
regret O
to O
her O
. O
It O
was O
therefore O
with O
cordial O
approbation O
that O
after O
the O
interval O
of O
a O
few O
moments O
, O
she O
replied O
, O
" O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
you O
are O
right O
. O
Nature O
has O
done O
so O
much O
for O
you O
, O
my O
dear O
friend O
, O
that O
our O
wish O
to O
keep O
you O
constantly O
with O
us O
might O
easily O
, O
had O
you O
shown O
less O
courage O
, O
have O
tempted O
us O
to O
fancy O
that O
you O
wanted O
nothing O
which O
you O
have O
not O
got O
, O
or O
which O
we O
could O
not O
give O
you O

But O
you O
are O
quite O
right O
in O
refusing O
to O
consent O
to O
this O
. O
We O
will O
immediately O
return O
to O
Germany S-GPE

you O
shall O
be O
placed O
at O
the O

admirable O
institution O

so O
rapidly O
made O
your O

him O

Two S-CARDINAL
yeas O
of O
well O
- O
directed O
devotion O
to O
study O
, O
my O
dear O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
will O
perhaps O
make O
you O
feel O
more O
at O
your O
ease O
among O
us O
, O
though O
I O
doubt O
, O
if O
it O
can O
produce O
any O
change O
which O
will O
make O
us O
love O
you O
better O
. O
" O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
! O
dearest O
Miss O
Brotherton S-PERSON
! O
" O
exclaimed O
Michael S-PERSON
— O
while O
perhaps O
the O
brightest O
beam O
of O
hope O
that O
ever O
yet O
shot O
from O
his O
eyes O
, O
met O
hers O
as O
she O
affectionately O
gazed O
upon O
him O
, O
" O
that O
was O
not O
what O
I O
— O
what O
I O
dared O
venture O
to O
hope O
and O
ask O
for O
. O
What O
you O
now O
propose O
, O
would O
be O
a O
happiness O
, O
the O
idea O
of O
which O
I O
think O
I O
should O
have O
turned O
from O
, O
even O
in O
my O
dreams O
, O
from O
shame O
at O
its O
towering O
ambition O
. O
All O
I O
meant O
to O
ask O
was O
, O
your O
kind O
aid O
to O
place O
me O
in O
some O
business O
where O
I O
might O
earn O
a O
maintenance O
, O
that O
in O
a B-DATE
year I-DATE
or I-DATE
two E-DATE
might O
prevent O
my O
being O
a O
burden O
to O
you O
— O
and O
now O
— O
" O
" O
And O
now O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
I O
tell O
you O
fairly O
, O
that O
I O
have O
not O
the O
slightest O
intention O
of O
doing O
any O
such O
thing O
. O
Besides O
my O
own O
particular O
objection O
to O
such O
a O
mode O
of O
proceeding O
, O
I O
have O
lately O
heard O
a O
little O
anecdote O
of O
you O
, O
from O
your O
friend O
Martha S-PERSON
, O
which O
makes O
it O
very O
doubtful O
whether O
you O
deserve O
that O
species O
of O
independence O
— O
for O
she O
put O
it O
in O
your O
possession O
once O
, O
you O
know O
— O
and O
you O
could O
not O
keep O
it O
. O
I O
shall O
manage O
better O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
depend O
upon O
it O
. O
One B-DATE
week E-DATE
more O
of O
idleness O
in O
this O
sweet O
spot O
— O
and O
then O
we O
travel O
back O
to O
Germany S-GPE
. O
You O
shall O
not O
be O
left O
to O
study O
in O
a O
more O
forsaken O
condition O
than O
was O
your O
brother O
. O
We O
shall O
be O
within O
an O
easy O
distance O
of O
you O
, O
my O
dear O
Michael S-PERSON
. O
One S-CARDINAL
corner O
of O
my O
castle O
must O
hold O
us O
, O
while O
another O
is O
beautified O
, O
and O
it O
is O
likely O
enough O
the O
work O
will O
go O
on O
all O
the O
better O
for O
our O
being O
there O
. O
" O
" O
And O
your O
visit O
to O
Rome S-GPE
given O
up O
for O
my O
sake O
? O
" O
cried O
Michael S-PERSON
. O
" O
Oh O
! O
no O
, O
no O
, O
no O
! O
" O
" O
No O
, O
no O
, O
no O
, O
most O
certainly O
, O
" O
replied O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
laughing O
, O
" O
I O
would O
not O
give O
up O
that O
journey O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
for O
more O
than O
I O
will O
say O
, O
" O
All O
is O
not O
lost O
that O
is O
delayed O

" O
Instead O
of O
giving O
up O
the O
plan O
, O
I O
only O
mean O
to O
improve O
it O
. O
Tell O
me O
, O
and O
tell O
me O
honestly O
, O
dear O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
do O
you O
not O
think O
in O
your O
heart O
that O
we O
shall O
, O
one O
and O
all O
, O
enjoy O
this O
journey O
more O
if O
you O
are O
with O
us O
? O
" O
But O
my O
happiness O
seems O
greater O
than O
I O
can O
bear O
! O
Where O
is O
Edward S-PERSON
? O
Let O
me O
walk O
, O
and O
talk O
with O
him O
! O
He O
is O
used O
to O
you O
, O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
and O
all O
this O
may O
not O
seem O
to O
him O
so O
very O
much O
like O
a O
dream O
as O
it O
does O
to O
me O
. O
If O
he O
tells O
me O
it O
is O
all O
real O
, O
I O
shall O
believe O
it O

with O
these O
words O
, O
and O
his O
fine O
face O
glowing O
with O
all O
the O
best O
and O
happiest O
feelings O
of O
our O
nature O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
bounded O
from O
the O
presence O
of O
his O
benefactress O
to O
seek O
his O
brother O
. O
" O
I O
might O
have O
lived O
a O
good O
while O
in O
my O
fine O
house O
, O
at O
Milford S-GPE
, O
and O
received O
a O
prodigious O
number O
of O
complimentary O
visits O
from O
my O
elegant O
neighbours O
, O
before O
I O
should O
have O
enjoyed O
half B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour E-TIME
as O
I O
have O
done O
this O
, O
" O
thought O
the O
happy O
Mary B-PERSON
Brotherton E-PERSON
, O
as O
she O
strolled O
out O
through O
an O
open O
window O
, O
that O
led O
to O
a O
little O
garden O
of O
orange O
- O
trees O

" O
How O
delicious O
is O
the O
air O
this B-TIME
morning E-TIME
! O
" O
But O
where O
was O
the O
climate O
, O
where O
, O
at O
that O
moment O
, O
she O
would O
have O
felt O
it O
to O
be O
otherwise O
? O
Michael S-PERSON
had O
no O
difficulty O
in O
finding O
his O
brother O
, O
who O
in O
truth O
was O
lingering O
near O
, O
on O
purpose O
to O
question O
him O
after O
this O
interview O
. O
" O
Come O
with O
me O
, O
Edward S-PERSON
! O
" O
cried O
the O
agitated O
boy O
, O
seizing O
his O
arm O
| | O
" O
here O
are O
our O
hats O
— O
come O
with O
me O
into O
that O
little O
grove O
yonder O
— O
my O
heart O
will O
burst O
if O
I O
do O
not O
instantly O
tell O
you O
what O
has O
passed O

" O
And O
arm O
- O
in O
- O
arm O
they O
crossed O
the O
road O
, O
and O
a O
small O
enclosure O
opposite O
, O
and O
there O
found O
themselves O
under O
the O
shelter O
of O
a O
little O
wood O
, O
thick O
enough O
to O
exclude O
the O
peering O
eyes O
of O
mortals O
, O
as O
well O
as O
that O
of O
the O
sun O
. O
Notwithstanding O
their O
eagerness O
for O
the O
communication O
which O
was O
to O
follow O
, O
and O
which O
was O
pretty O
equally O
strong O
in O
both O
, O
not O
a O
word O
was O
uttered O
by O
either O
till O
they O
reached O
this O
covert O
, O
and O
then O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
throwing O
himself O
upon O
a O
bank O
, O
and O
casting O
his O
hat O
away O
, O
clasped O
his O
hands O
, O
and O
raising O
his O
eyes O
to O
heaven O
, O
exclaimed O
, O
" O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
she O
is O
an O
angel O
! O
" O
Edward S-PERSON
had O
not O
followed O
his O
brother's O
example O
, O
in O
lying O
down O
, O
but O
stood O
before O
him O
in O
act O
to O
listen O
. O
But O
there O
was O
something O
in O
these O
words O
that O
seemed O
to O
shake O
him O
, O
for O
he O
turned O
away O
without O
answering O
. O
" O
Has O
she O
ever O
named O
to O
you O
her O
plans O
about O
me O
? O
" O
resumed O
Michael S-PERSON
. O
" O
Yes O
! O
" O
replied O
Edward S-PERSON
. O
" O
Then O
you O
know O
that O
it O
is O
not O
her O
intention O

assist O
me O

by O
enabling O
me O
to O
learn O
any O
trade O

handicraft O

" O
" O
No O
such O
idea O

Michael S-PERSON

ever O
entered O
her O
head O

said O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
gravely O
. O
" O
But O
, O
my O
dear O
fellow O
! O
you O
seem O
to O
take O
all O
this O
so O
very O
coolly O

that O

all O
this O

it O

Oh O
! O
what O
cold O
, O
what O
chilling O
words O

Edward S-PERSON

with O
sudden O

so O
composedly O

" O
" O
First S-ORDINAL
, O
dear O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
because O
it O
is O
no O
news O
to O
me O
. O
And O
secondly S-ORDINAL
, O
because O
I O
am O
a O
selfish O
wretch O

was O
thinking O
, O
perhaps O
, O
more O
of O
my O

yours O

Forgive O
me O
for O
it O
, O
my O
own O
dear O
Michael S-PERSON
! O
But O
I O
would O
rather O
have O
had O
it O
decided O
that O
we O
should O
have O
both O
marched O
off O
, O
and O
taken O
service O
under O
the O
Emperor O
of O
Austria S-GPE

I O
know O
that O
commissions O
would O
have O
been O
obtained O
for O
us O

" O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
as O
his O
brother O
uttered O
these O
words O

looked O
up O
into O
his O
face O
with O
an O
expression O
of O
such O
astonishment O

dismay O
, O
that O
the O
blood O
rushed O
to O
Edward's S-PERSON
face O

he O
turned O
away O
to O
conceal O
his O
confusion O

" O
Edward S-PERSON
! O
you O
are O
a O
mystery O
to O
me O

Michael S-PERSON

springing O
upon O
his O
feet O

by O
the O
arm O

weary O

rising O
every O
day O
to O
feel O
that O

a O
wretch O
unworthy O

so O
pretty O
violently O

very O
red O

a O
horror O

a O
misery O

no O

the O

that O
passed O
through O
Michael's S-PERSON
frame O

itself O
felt O
by O
the O
arm O
of O
Edward S-PERSON

he O
still O
held O

then O
he O
stopped O
, O
and O
without O
raising O
his O
eyes O
from O
the O
ground O
, O
said O
, O
" O
Michael S-PERSON
! O
How O
is O
it O
you O
understand O
me O

Do O
you O
suppose O
that O
I O

been O
guilty O

some O
criminal O
act O

you O

" O
" O
Would O
you O
not O
shudder O

if O
you O
heard O
me O
say O
, O
that O
I O
was O
a O
wretch O
unworthy O

" O
" O
Poor O
Michael S-PERSON
! O
perhaps O
I O
might O

but O
still O
I O
doubt O
if O
I O
should O
understand O
the O
phrase O
as O
you O
do O
. O
It O
is O
so O
difficult O
, O
so O
impossible O
to O
express O
temperately O
and O
soberly O
, O
my O
own O
reprobation O
of O
the O
feelings O
that O
destroy O
me O
! O
And O
yet O
, O
dear O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
" O
he O
continued O
more O
tranquilly O
, O
" O
I O
could O
have O
fancied O
that O
there O
was O
something O
working O
in O
your O
own O
heart O
which O
might O
have O
taught O
you O
in O
some O
degree O
to O
guess O
the O
state O
of O
mine O
— O
I O
have O
no O
strength O
, O
no O
courage O
to O
enter O
on O
the O
guilty O
subject O
fully O
— O
but O
— O
that O
you O
may O
not O
think O
me O
a O
felon O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
, O
I O
will O
tell O
you O
in O
one O
audacious O
word O
, O
I O
LOVE O
, O
and O
that O
with O
a O
fervour O
, O
a O
vehemence O
of O
passion O

that O
often O
makes O
me O
tremble O
at O
myself O
— O
for O
did O
it O
ever O
master O
me O
so O
far O
as O
to O
force O
a O
confession O
of O
it O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
its O
object O
, O
I O
never O
could O
look O
up O
again O
, O
but O
must O
and O
would O
for O
ever O
become O
an O
alien O
from O
all O

love O
, O

a O
friendless O
wanderer O
on O

" O
Though O
shocked O
more O
deeply O
than O
he O
had O
any O
wish O
or O
power O
to O
express O
, O
Michael S-PERSON
could O
not O
resist O
the O
belief O
, O
which O
came O
with O
terrible O
strength O
upon O
him O
, O
that O
his O
unhappy O
brother O
had O
conceived O
a O
passion O
for O
some O
married O
woman O
, O
and O
that O
his O
best O
chance O
of O
recovering O
both O
his O
virtue O
and O
his O
tranquillity O
would O
be O
by O
following O
the O
wish O
he O
had O
expressed O
, O
and O
by O
entering O
on O
a O
new O
and O
active O
career O
, O
to O
give O
himself O
a O
chance O
of O
obliterating O
from O
his O
mind O
the O
feelings O
which O
had O
so O
unhappily O
taken O
possession O
of O
it O
. O
Such O
a O
destination O
for O
Edward S-PERSON
must O
of O
course O
destroy O
some O
the O
very O
brightest O
of O
his O
own O
beautiful O
day O
- O
dreams O
: O
but O
there O
was O
a O
fund O
of O
integrity O
and O
real O
goodness O
in O
the O
heart O
of O
Michael S-PERSON
that O
permitted O
him O
not O
at O
that O
moment O
to O
think O
of O
himself O
. O
" O
Edward S-PERSON
! O
" O
said O
he O
solemnly O
, O
" O
if O
this O
be O
so O
, O
follow O
the O
course O

your O
better O

suggested O

at O

the O
profession O

has O
ever O
been O
accounted O
a O
noble O

under O
happier O
circumstances O

generous O
benefactress O

" O
" O
Michael S-PERSON
! O
" O
replied O
Edward S-PERSON
, O
looking O
in O
his O
face O
with O
an O
expression O
of O
suffering O
that O
almost O
amounted O
to O
agony O
— O
" O
I O
would O
rather O
die O
first S-ORDINAL

" O
These O
words O
seemed O
intended O
to O
close O
the O
conversation O

at O
any O
rate O

retraced O
their O
path O

the O
house O

a O
fond O
pressure O
, O
expressive O
of O
love O
and O
pity O
, O
which O
Michael S-PERSON
gave O
to O
the O
arm O
of O
Edward S-PERSON
before O
he O
parted O
from O
it O

was O
all O
that O
passed O
between O
them O
further O
at O

time O

passing O
her O
arm O
through O
his O

accompanied O
him O
to O
the O
scene O
of O
their O
former O
tête O

. O
There O
was O
no O
shyness O
on O
the O
part O
of O
Michael S-PERSON
. O
The O
familiar O
appellation O
he O
had O
used O
was O
not O
assumed O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
proving O
his O
obedience O
, O
but O
resulted O
from O
a O
genuine O
feeling O
of O
affectionate O
confidence O
in O
every O
word O
she O
had O
uttered O
, O
and O
which O
had O
left O
on O
his O
mind O
the O
belief O
that O
she O
was O
not O
only O
his O
generous O
patroness O
, O

his O
loving O
friend O

" O
I O

" O
" O
It O
is O
something O

Michael S-PERSON

" O

I O
am O
certain O
that O
you O

Indeed O
I O
fear O
greatly O

I O
cannot O

looking O
with O
considerable O
surprise O
at O
her O
varying O
colour O

agitated O

one S-CARDINAL

resumed O

" O

very O
agitated O

out O

much O
to O
Michael's S-PERSON
astonishment O

comprehend O
why O

such O
very O
strong O
emotion O

All O
that O
can O
be O
said O
in O
addition O
to O
this O
is O
, O
that O
when O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
Dowling's E-PERSON
affairs O
came O
to O
be O
wound O
up O
, O
there O
was O
discovered O
to O
be O
a O
sufficient O
surplus O
to O
afford O
a O
small O
independence O
to O
each O
of O
his O
children O
, O
which O
, O
being O
divided O
according O
to O
the O
proportion O
dictated O
by O
the O
knight's O
will O
, O
gave O
something O
approaching O
to O
a O
Benjamin's S-NORP
mess O
portion O
to O
his O
daughter O
Martha S-PERSON

To O

as O
well O
as O
occasionally O
to O
visit O
some O
members O
of O
her O
family O
, O
Martha S-PERSON
made O
frequent O
excursions O
to O
England S-GPE
: O
but O
her O
happiest O
hours O
were O
those O
she O
passed O
with O
her O
dear O
friends O
in O
Germany S-GPE
, O
by O
whom O
she O
is O
ever O
received O
with O
open O

Mrs. O
Tremlett S-PERSON
is O
still O
enjoying O
an O
old O
age O
of O
perfect O
comfort O
, O
cheered O
by O
warm O
affection O
, O
and O
is O
already O
the O
darling O
of O
many O
little O
hearts O
. O
There O
is O
no O
record O
to O
be O
found O
in O
any O
documents O
relating O
to O
the O
inhabitants O
of O
the O
chateau O
, O
showing O
that O
Edward B-PERSON
Armstrong E-PERSON
ever O
entered O
the O
Austrian S-NORP
service O
. O
It O
is O
, O
therefore O
, O
most O
reasonable O
to O
suppose O
that O
this O
wish O
was O
never O
complied O
with O
