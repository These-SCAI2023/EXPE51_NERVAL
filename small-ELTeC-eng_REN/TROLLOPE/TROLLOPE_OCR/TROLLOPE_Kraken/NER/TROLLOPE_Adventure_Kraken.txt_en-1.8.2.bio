something O
in O
the O
usual O
way O

wearing O
stiff O
new O

made O
grandeur O

not O

Neither O

this O
splendid O
dinner O

on O
the O
most O

no O

not O
drive O
four S-CARDINAL
horses O
at O
the O
races O

To O
this O
there O
were O
indeed O
two S-CARDINAL
exceptions O
. O
The O
frst O
was O
the O
Right O
Honourable O
Lady O
Clarissa B-PERSON
Shrimpton E-PERSON

but O
this O
distinguished O
lady O
, O
though O
she O
drove O
only O
one S-CARDINAL
pony O
instead O
of O
four S-CARDINAL
horses O
, O
was O
considered O
by O
all O
the O
country O
round O
as O
the O
one S-CARDINAL
thing O
needful O
to O
render O
a O
party O
completely O
elegant O
. O
She O
was O
, O
indeed O
, O
neither O
young O
, O
handsomne O
, O
nor O
rich O
, O
but O
she O
was O
Lady O
Clarissa S-PERSON
, O
and O
this O
was O
enough O
. O
The O
other O
exception O
was O
to O
be O
found O
in O
the O
rotund O
person O
of O
Dr. O
Crockley S-PERSON
, O
who O
having O
formerly O
been O
a O
celebrated O
quack O
, O
made O
a O
little O
fortune O
, O
and O
taken O
out O
a O
diploma O
, O
had O
lately O
married O
a O
beauty O
, O
and O
seutled O
in O
the O
town O
of O
Ashleigh S-GPE
, O
where O
he O
was O
well O
pleased O
to O
pick O
up O
a O
few O
guiuea O
fees O
, O
both O
as O
a O
public O
eidence O
of O
his O
being O
a O
renal O
Mi.D. O
, O
and O
as O
a O
private O
fund O
wlerewith O
to O
indulge O
his O
still O
ery O
tender O
passion O
. O
, O
by O
buying O
finery O
for O
his O
pretty O
young O
wife O
. O
This O
fat O
litle O
gentleman O
was O
an O
especial O
favourite O
with O
Sir O
MIat B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
thew E-PERSON
, O
chiefly O
on O
aceount O
of O
his O
jocund O
humour O
and O
ready O
langh O
: O
| | O
and O
also O
, O
perhaps O
, O
because O
he O
had O
a O
pleasan O
way O
, O
peculiar O
to O
him O
- O
self O
, O
of O
paying O
compliments O
in O
the O
bluntest O
and O
. O
most O
unstudied O
manner O
possible O
, O
But O
, O
notwithstanding O
the O
presence O
of O
all O
. O
these O
distinguished O
per- O
sons O
, O
the O
dinner O
moved O
on O
very O
slowly O
. O
Sir O
Mlatthew S-PERSON
, O
indeed O
, O
was O
as O
brilliant O
as O
it O
was O
possible O
for O
any O
man O
to O
be O
under O
the O
circum- O
stances O
, O
and O
Lady O
Clarissa S-PERSON
, O
who O
did O
not O
scruple O
to O
declare O
that O
she O
was O
very O
partial O
to O
him O
, O
- O
listened O
to O
all O
he O
said O
to O
her O
with O
as O
much O
attention O
at O
least O
as O
any O
lady O
could O
be O
expected O
to O
do O
, O
who O
was O
making O
one O
of O
sixteen S-CARDINAL

a O
dinner O
, O
where O
there O
were O
an O

. O
r O
, O
Crockley S-PERSON
, O
too O
, O
laughed O
repeatedly O
: O
but O
his O
laugh O
was O
like O
a O
Lucifer S-PERSON

that O

The O
very O
sight O
of O
the O
servants O
as O
they O
panted O
round O
the O
table O
, O
was O
qite O
enough O
to O
smother O
and O
stifle O
all O
inclination O
for O
enjoyment O
-- O
their O
shoes O
creaked O
- O
their O
faces O
shone O
- O
ice O
became O
water O

the O

looked O
as O

fainted O

its O

caught O
the O
unfragrant O

In O
short O
, O
it O
was O
a O
great O
dinner O
in O
the O
dog O

days O
, O
and O
no O
more O
need O

said O
of O
it O

Great O
was O
the O
inward O
satisfaction O
of O
every O
guest O
, O
when O
at O
last O
Lady B-PERSON
Dowling E-PERSON
rose O
, O
and O
gave O
signal O
that O
the O
party O
was O
to O
be O
divided O
in O
al O
. O
The O
languid O
ldies O
welcomed O
the O
coolness O
of O
the O
marble O
hall O
as O
they O
passed O
through O
it O
, O
and O
the O
gentlemen O
gazed O
eagerly O
at O
the O
butler O
as O

brought O
forwvard O
a O
fresh O

a O

But O
the O
cnjoyment O
of O
neither O
party O
lasted O
long O

for O
ady O
Dowling S-PERSON
was O
too O
grand O
and O

solemn O
not O
to O
marshal O
all O
her O
company O
into O
her O
fine O
drawing O

where O
they O
were O
all O
ceremoniously O
deposited O
on O
satin O

I O
can't O

'' O
Eery O

drawn O

don't O
wish O
to O
spoil O
the O

Then O
lowering O
his O

he O

, O
as O
near O
to O
the O
ear O
of O
Sir O

as O
he O
could O

I O

an O
almost O

'' O
The O

much O
earlier O

not O

greatly O
to O

the O

was O

power O
of O
turning O
the O

Things O
were O
in O

state O
, O
when O
Lady O

suddenly O
rose O
from O
the O
silken O
couch O
amidst O
whose O

im- O
bedded O

, O

darted O
through O

open O
French S-NORP
- O
window O
, O
and O
out O
| ..-| O
ignorant O
of O
the O
rank O
of O
Lady O
Clarissa S-PERSON
, O
he O
must O
from O
that O
moment O
have O
fclt O
an O
innate O
conviction O
that O
she O
was O
somebody O

for O
nobody O
that O
was O
not O
somebody O
could O
have O
vehtured O
upon O

escapade O

solemn O
presence O

' O
The O
effect O
it O
produced O
was O
electric O
. O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
darted O
across O
the O
room O
with O
the O
eagerness O
ofa O
man O
of O
gallantry O
and O
gaiety O
. O
He O
piqued O
himself O
upon O
being O
, O
of O
all O
the O
great O
men O
in O
the O
neighbourhood O
the O
one O
upon O
whom O
Lady B-PERSON
Clarissa E-PERSON
bestowed O
the O
most O
attention O
. O
His O
estimate O
of O
the O
outward O
advan- O
tages O
of O
his O
extensive O
person O
was O
indeed O
not O
a O
low O
one O
| | O
and O
, O
despite O
all O
his O
lady O
could O
do O
to O
ecrush O
such O
an O
odious O
idea O
, O
he O
was O
conscious O
that O
he O
was O
dcvoted O
to O
the O
fair O
sex O
, O
and O
flattered O
himself O
that O
the O
fair O
sex O
was O
naot O
ungrateful O
. O
In O
fact O
, O
his O
general O
manner O
to O
ladies O
had O
a O
good O
deal O
of O
what O
in O
female O
slang O
is O
called O
swaining O
, O
: O
but O
to O
Lady O
Clarissa S-PERSON
it O
was O
certainly O
something O
more O
. O
Had O
she O
been O
simply O
Miss O
Shrimpton S-PERSON
, O
it O
is O
prbable O
that O
, O
notwithsstanding O
her O
great O
mental O
advantages O
, O
she O
would O
never O
ave O
been O
exposed O
to O
the O
danger O
of O
this O
fascinating O
distinction O
, O
for O
she O
was O
nearly B-DATE
forty I-DATE
years I-DATE
old E-DATE
, O
had O
a O
sharp O
nose O
, O
and O
was O
deplorably O
thin O
. O
But O
Sir O
Matthew S-PERSON
was O
not O
a O
man O
to O
be O
insensible O
to O
the O
charm O
of O
getting O
talked O
of O
in O
the O
neighbourhood O
about O
his O
devsotion O
to O
Lady O
Clarissa S-PERSON
any O
body O
, O
even O
had O
she O
been O
a O
skeleton O
with O
aGorgon's O
hcad O
. O
There O
was O
, O
however O
, O
independently O
of O
her O
bewitching O
title O
, O
a O
charm O
in O
her O
con- O
versation O
and O
character O
, O
to O
which O
the O
knight O
was O
peculiarly O
sensible O
Her O
ladyship O
was O
celebrated O
for O
her O
davotion O
both O
to O
literature O
and O
art O
| | O
and O
she O
permittcd O
all O
the O
world O
to O
know O
, O
for O
indeed O
she O
never O
ceased O
to O
repeat O
it O
, O
that O
talent O
of O
every O
kind O
was O
to O
her O
an O
object O
of O
idolatry O
. O
Now O
Sir O

knew O
that O

was O
full O

, O
every O
kinl O
of O

and O
it O
was O
certainly O
very O
delightful O
to O
be O
appreciated O
by O
such O
a O
uperior O
creature O
as O
Lady B-PERSON

So O
strongly O
indeed O
did O
this O
intellectual O
sympathy O
between O

occasionally O
manifest O
itsclf O
, O
that O

Nor O
was O

the O
sudden O

upon O

Lady B-PERSON

found O
consolation O
in O
the O
well O

that O

rarely O

Michael S-PERSON
turned O
round O
again O

stood O
stock O
still O

It O
was O
quite O
evident O
that O
he O
had O
some O
speech O
ta O
make O
which O
he O
had O
apparently O
forgotten O
, O
for O
it O
was O
impossible O
for O
any O
child O
to O
look O
more O
completely O
distrcssed O

at O
a O

it O
became O
pretty O

, O
in O

the O
poor O

was O
going O
to O
cry O

some O
ingenious O
per- O
sons O
doubted O
whether O
it O
might O
not O
be O
in O
his O
part O
to O
do O
so O

this O
idea O
was O
speedily O
removed O
by O
the O
very O

of O

the O
two S-CARDINAL

bestowed O

In O

this O
it O
seemed O
as O

the O
little O
fellow O
caught O
somne O
stimulating O
sounds O
from O

cast O
more B-CARDINAL

one E-CARDINAL
furtive O
glance O
in O

at O

it O
is O
quite O
clear O
that O

is O

it O

Yet O
still O
the O

nothing O

it O
was O
that O
the O

this O
state O
, O
Mr. O
Elgood B-PERSON
Sharpton E-PERSON
agrced O
with O
Mr. O
Poulet S-PERSON
that O
it O
might O
perhaps O
be O
as O
well O
to O
let O
an O
apothecary O
from O
Tugswell S-PERSON
visit O
the O
factory O
, O
to O
which O
reluctant O
decision O
two S-CARDINAL
reasons O
strongly O
contribnted O
. O
The O
first S-ORDINAL
was O
, O
that O
though O
with O
his O
usual O
fore- O
thought O
he O
had O
divided O
his O
noctnrnal O
buryings O
between O
the O
churchyards O
of O
Tugswell S-GPE
and O
Meddington S-GPE
, O
the O
clergymen O
of O
both O
had O
declarcd O
that O
their O
frequency O
rendered O
it O
necessary O
that O
some O
inquiry O
should O
be O
made O
into O
the O
cause O
of O
so O
great O
a O
mortality O
- O
and O
the O
second S-ORDINAL
was O
that O
the O
fact O
of O
the O
mistress O
of O
the O
apprentice O
house O
, O
being O
herself O
at O
the O
point O
of O
death O
from O
the O
same O
malady O
, O
must O
infallibly O
prove O
to O
the O
medical O
visitant O
that O
it O
was O
no O
ireatment O
peculiar O
to O
the O
children O
which O
hed O
oc- O
casioned O
it O
, O
but O
that O
it O
had O
come O
beyond O
all O
possibility O
of O
contradiction O
by O
the O
visitation O
of O
Gol S-PERSON
. O
Nevertheless O
the O
medical O
gentleman O
ventured O
to O
declare O
that O
nothing O
would O
be O
so O
likely O
to O
stop O
the O
contagion O
as O
nourishing O
food O
| | O
upon O
which O
the O
terrified O
manufacturer O
astonished O
all O
the O
butchcrs O
within O
his O
reach O
, O
by O
commanding O
a O
large O
supply O
of O
beef O
and O
mntton O
`` O

eneug O
to O

holesome O
soup O
, O
'' O
and O
before O
another O
ghastly O
week O
had O
passed O
away O
, O
the O
wisdom O
of O
this O
prescription O
became O
so O
evident O
that O
when O
settling O
accounts O
togcther O
at O
the O
end O
of O
it O
, O
MIr S-PERSON
. O
Poulet S-PERSON
hinted O
to O
his O
employer O
that O
he O
did O
not O
feel O
quite O
sure O
whether O

the O
whole O
a O
little O

not O

For O
all O

left O

little O

omforted O

invigorated O
by O
the O
belief O
that O

had O
a O
great O
duty O

simple O

they O
puzzled O
her O

considerably O

, O
it O
was O
so O
very O
odd O
that O

out O

take O
absolutely O
no O

listened O
to O
all O
the O
hints O

to O
which O
these O
feelings O
gave O
rise O
with O
a O
sort O
of O
gentle O
indifference O
, O
which O
was O
doubtless O
ery O
provoking O
, O
till O
at O
length O
she O
was O
induced O
to O
damp O
the O
curiosity O
, O
which O
she O
feared O
might O
prove O
inconveniently O
active O
duringher O

was O

quite O
out O
of O
the O

she O
every O

The O
heart O
of O
this O

so O
clingingly O

under O

a O
thousanl O
painful O
thoughts O

with O
the O
consciousness O
that O

Miclael S-PERSON

unskilful O

the O
result O
of O
all O
the O
moving O

we O

you O
