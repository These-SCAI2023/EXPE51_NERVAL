the O
Right O

this O
distinguished O

she O
drove O
only O
one O
|
| O
pony O
instead O
of O
four B-CARDINAL
horses O
, O
was O
considered O
by O
all O
the O
country O

round O
as O
the O
one B-CARDINAL
thing O
needful O
to O
render O
a O

completely O
elegant O
. O
|
| O
She O
was O
, O
indeed O
, O
neither O
young O

but O
she O
was O

Lady B-PERSON

, O
and O
this O
was O
enough O
. O
|
| O
The O
other O
exception O
was O
to O
be O
found O
in O
the O
rotund O

of O
Dr. O

who O
having O
formerly O

little O

: O
  O
|

and O
also O
, O
perhaps O
, O
because O
he O
had O
a O

peculiar O

very O

must O
from O

fclt O
an O
innate O
conviction O
that O

Sir O

upon O
whom O

the O

the O

was O
indeed O
not O

, O
despite O

all O
his O

could O
do O
to O
ecrush O
such O
an O
odious O
idea O

conscious O

that O
he O
was O
dcvoted O

the O

In O

, O
his O
general O
manner O

a O

called O
swaining O

to O

it O
was O
certainly O
something O
more O

Had O

into O
the O

infallibly O
