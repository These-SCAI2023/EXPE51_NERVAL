P R E FAC E.
WVn the author of ` Michael Armstrong'' first determined on
attempting to draw the attention of her countrymen to the fearful
evils inherent in the Factory ystem, as carried out in our manufac-
turing towns, she intended to divide her work into two portions, which
should present the same subject under two different phases. It was
her intention in thce first of these to drag into the light of day, and
place before the eyes of Englishmen, the hideous mass of injustice
and suffering to which thousands of infant labourers are subjected, who
toil in our monstcr spinning-mills. In the second, she proposed that the
hero of her tale, having lived through his toil-worn boyhood, should
have been seen embarkcl in those perfectly constitutional struggles
Ior the amelioration of the suflerings of his class, in which many of
the more enlightened operatives have been for some years engagedt.
The rst division of the subject has been some time in the reader's
hands. The true but most painful picture has been drawn faithfully
ant conscientiously. Of course voices have been raised to deny
loudly the truth of all the authar's statements, and to assert the whole
to be a mere tissue of invention and falsehood. The same charges
have been made against her upon anolher occnsion, and she has lived
to see the truth of her statements, so imputgned, universally admittetd.
She awaits with perfect confilence the time when similar justice shall
be rendered to these pages.
But with respect to that division of the subject which it was in-
tenel to bring forward in the latter part of ler work, the author's
views have undergone very considerable change. Inowing the immense
amount of evil to be remedied, and the urgent necessity, for many
reasons, that this remedy should not be delayed, it is grievous to see
REFACE.
misguided and unfortunate men pursuing a course which muslt neces-
sarily neutralize the efforts of their true friends. When those in whose
behalf she hoped to move the sympathy of their country are found
busy in scenes of ourage and lawless violence, and uniting themselves
with individuals whose doctrines are subversive of every species of
social order, the author feels that it would be alike acting in violation
of her own principles, and doing injury to the cause she wishes to
serte, were she to persist in an attempt to hold up as objects of public
sympathy, men who have stained their righteous cause with deeds of
violence and blood. TThe author is well aware that many, as well
operatives as their superiors, who were engaged in a virtuous struggle
against the Inwless power which oppresses them, deplore the madness
of these ill-advised men as much as herself. But the cause has been
too much sullied, and the sufferers too closely associated in the public
eye with those who have been guilty of all she most deprecates, to
permit her coutinuing the work as she intended.
Uhder tlese circumstanees she has determined that the existence of
ler hero as an operatire shall close with his childhool. No miseon-
struction of prineiples, no misconception of motives can exist with
regard to an attempt to ameliorate the lot of infant labourers. That her
pages may assist in promoting this object is her humble and most
et boe. `The Lite and Aenures of Micael Arsrong''are,
therefore, coucluded in the twelfth number.

No traveller can ride or drive withia sight of Dowling Lolge,
without heing tempted to inquire, : Whose house is that ?
It forms, indeed, a very striking object on the right of the London
road, as the hill rises gradually, and overlooks the town of Ashleigh,
one of the busiest in Lancashire, to the left; for although the trees
about the mansion are not yet of sufficient growth to make it pic-
turesque, its lofty portico, well-proportioned wings, and command-
ing site, render it an ornament to the neighbourhood for miles
round.
Those who are admitted to a nearer view of the house (and, for
the conveience of the public, every Wenesday is set apart for
its heing shown), will find still more to admire, than such as see it
only from a distance. It has its park and its pinery; conservatories,
which cause the mercnry in the thermometer, when paraled through
them, to run up to the cocoa-ripening heat of the tropics., nd ice-
houses that would bring it down agnin to the temperature of Bhering's
traits. It has three drawing-rooms, two dining-rooms, a great
library, all full of new books; as many bedrooms, dressing-rooms,
and boudoirs, as a great man's house ought to have, an a stuly
besides-Sir Matthew Dowling's own private study. This de-
lightful little apartnet is small, not more than twelve feet sqare;
but nathing can be more agreeable andl convenient. lt opens by
one door from the great hall of entrance, and by another commu-

nicates through a long stone-passage with the offices of the mansiou:
enabling the kuight to receivse, without interruption, not only ls
overlookers (Sir Matthew being the poprietor of many cotton-mills),
but his coachman, gardener, bailifl, and whomever else he might
wish to transact business with.
O the fitting up of this princely mansion, it is only necessary to
sy, that it is done in a spirit of emulative imitation, which ren-
ders it fully equal, in this respect, to the most finished private
dwellings in Europe. The furniure is uniformly rich throughout:
the picture-frames in the best style of art; iaxony carpets in the
drawing-sooms, Turkey ditto in the dining-reoms, russels in the
bedrooms, and indeed not a single inch of Kidderminster any
where, except in the garrets.
I will not attempt to state the amount of Sir Matthew Dowling's
wealth ; Cocker himself would have found it a laborious task to
make the calculation; and it is sufficient for the gratification of all
reasonable curiosity to say, that throughout the whole line of that
Golconda conntry, which, being the busiest of the manufacturing
districts, is probably the richest in the world, there was not any one
who could vie in wealth with him. In a worl, he shone amidst his
rich neighbours like a golden sun, surrounded by siler moons.
But Sir Matthew was a superior man in all ways. He was six
feet two inches in height, and stout in proportion, with hands and
feet that might have sufficed a giant. His intellectual gifts were
also of no ordinary character. He liked well enough, perhaps, to
stand pre-eminent in the commercial estimation of his neighbours;
but so enlightened was his spirit, that he liked better still to shine be-
fore their eyes as a man of taste, a literary and accomplished gentle-
man, a speaker of modern languages, a critical French scholar, a
playfnl votary of the muses himself, and a universal Mecaenas to all
who wielded a pen in their service. But beyond all else, Sir
Matthew valued himself upon his reputation for the lighter graces of
wit and guallantry: he sought to make himnself into something of
a delightful mixture between Killigrew and the Count de Gra-
mont : and there was no receptacle of wit from Joe Miller downwards,

the promotion of mirth and light-heartedness among his fellow-]
creatures; but tragedy and cmely often walk through the]

without difficulty in the career of Sir Mlatthew Dowling.
The wife of this prosperous gentleman hat also many admirable
qualities. She was not one of the idle gossipers who delight in
chattering about their own concerns to avery one vho will listen::
she despised such weakness, and had never been heard to hint atl
her ow parenage, or early history, to any one: rightly considering.
that when such matters are unceasingly discussed, they may be ex--

degree at all; but, though a good man, and an excellent clergyman
to boot, he had a strong taste for humour, and had already dis-
covered that his neighbour at the great house was rich in more
ways thanone. It was, therefore, with the utmost civility that he
answered,  My degree, Sir Matthew, was that of Master of Arts,''
` And pray, sir, does it give you any title by which you cnn he
listinguished as in any way a superior sort of person in society ?''
I am afraid not, Sir Matthew,'' was the reply.
1I thank you, sir, for your sincerity,'' rejoined the knight.  It
was important that l should ascertain the truth on this point.--You
are, then, never addressed in company as Mr. Master of Arts, or
any thing of that kind?'
e I. have never yet, Sir latthew, met with any one of sufficient
politeness to do me that honour,'' repliel Mr. Hetherington gravely.
`And I suppose you have lived in respectable society?''
Very decent soeiety-very decent, Sir Matthew,'' replied
Hetherington, whose mother was the daughter of a distinguished
nobleman.
Good morning, sir: I shall he happy to see you at Dowling
Lodge-that is to say, sir, if your gown does not lead you to object
to elegantamusements. I love science, MIr. Hetherington, and am
indeed devoted to every thing intellecetunal; but, notwithstanding
this, I am a worshipper at the shrine of grace and wit, and could
not exis among people who did not relish the lighter embellish-
ments of society.''
eI shuall be happy, Sir Matthew, to share in your gayer hours,
prvided I am fortnate enough to iind that you have no objection
to profit by my graver ones,'' replied the clergyman.
Sir Matthew returnel from this visit very well pleased with the
new reetor. Mlr. Augustus was immediately comforted by a letter,
informing him that he might eall in his accounts, and prepare to
leave the university as soon as he pleased; and, within ten days
after receiving it, the amiable young man was restored to the bosom
of his family.
Next to this primal hope of the Dowling race, came three young
ladies, between the ages of seventeen and twent-one; the two
eldest of thiem being as like as two peas, and the third like nothing
on earth hut herself. Then followed several young gentlemen,
who were placed at different fashionable schools; for Sir Matthew,
who was a man of very enlarged mind, declared it to be his opinion
and his principle, that the patronage of such a fortune as his should
be extended as widely as possible. Afer these young gentlemen
came, one after the other, with the interval of about eleven months
between them, ever so many little girls, who, for the present, were
all educated at home, having a particularly clever French governess.
All the rest were nice liutle children of diiferent degrees of baby-
haood; the dear little girls being remarkable for their long plaited
hair, short frocks, and furhelowed trousers, and the dear liutle boys
for the manly bustle with which they wore their Scotch honnets and
plaided tunics, which, considering that neither Sir Matthew nor his

lady hal ever been in Sicotland in their lives, showed great enlarge-
ment of national feeling. Altogether, it was considered to be the
finest family ever seehn.
It happened upon a broiliug day about the midle of July, during
e of the hottest summens ngland had ever known, that sir
Mauthew and Lady Dowling `entartained a party of distinguished
fashionables'' at dinner,
It may hae been remarked by those.who study such subjects,
that there is a difference betweon a dinner-party given at such a
grand mansion as that of Sir Matthew Dowling, and one at a dwell-
Pg of perhaps not a quarter the size, where the owners are of a dif-
ferent order of the aristocracy, huving a longer pedigres, and a
shorter purse. At hoth, probably,; the banquet will be a costly one,
yet the vne entertainment will comne of' in a manner as.unlike as
essible to the other. There is something in the usual way of wearing
stiff new-made grandeur, not far unlike that of wearing stiff new-
made clothes. Neither the onenor the other sit easily.
At this splendid dinner at Dowling Lodge, the company consisted
of a selection from the neighbouring families, made on the most le-
gitmate principles of exelusiveness: no family being invited who
did not drive four horses at the races. To this there were indeed
two exceptions. The frst was the Right Honourable Lady Clarissa
Shrimpton; but this distinguished lady, though she drove only one
pony instead of four horses, was considered by all the country
round as the one thing needful to render a party completely elegant.
She was, indeed, neither young, handsomne, nor rich, but she was
Lady Clarissa, and this was enough.
The other exception was to be found in the rotund person of Dr.
Crockley, who having formerly been a celebrated quack, made a
little fortune, and taken out a diploma, had lately married a beauty,
and seutled in the town of Ashleigh, where he was well pleased to
pick up a few guiuea fees, both as a public eidence of his being a
renal Mi.D., and as a private fund wlerewith to indulge his still
ery tender passion., by buying finery for his pretty young wife.
This fat litle gentleman was an especial favourite with Sir MIat-
thew, chiefly on aceount of his jocund humour and ready langh:;
and also, perhaps, because he had a pleasan way, peculiar to him-
self, of paying compliments in the bluntest and. most unstudied
manner possible,
But, notwithstanding the presence of all. these distinguished per-
sons, the dinner moved on very slowly. Sir Mlatthew, indeed, was
as brilliant as it was possible for any man to be under the circum-
stances, and Lady Clarissa, who did not scruple to declare that she
was very partial to him, - listened to all he said to her with as much
attention at least as any lady could be expected to do, who was
making one of sixteen at a dinner, where there were an equal num-
ber of dishes of hot meats reeking upon the table, and the thermo-
meter standing at 87'. r, Crockley, too, laughed repeatedly:
but his laugh was like a Lucifer match that fails, just kinling and
TIE LIFE AD ADVEFRES
sputtering a little, but going out before it is able to communicate its
light.
The very sight of the servants as they panted round the table,
was qite enough to smother and stifle all inclination for enjoyment
--their shoes creaked-their faces shone-ice became water-the
salad looked as if it were stewed-the cucumbers seemcd to have
fainted away-the prodigious turbot smelt fishy, and its attendant
lobster-sauce glowed not with a deeper tint, than did my ILady Dow-
ling's cheeks as her nose caught the unfragrant gale. In short,
it was a great dinner in the dog-days, and no more need be said of
it.
Great was the inward satisfaction of every guest, when at last
Lady Dowling rose, and gave signal that the party was to be
divided in al. The languid ldies welcomed the coolness of the
marble hall as they passed through it, and the gentlemen gazed
eagerly at the butler as he brought forwvard a fresh supply of claret,
and a reinforcement of ice. But the cnjoyment of neither party
lasted long; for ady Dowling was too grand and too solemn not
to marshal all her company into her fine drawing-room, where they
were all ceremoniously deposited on satin sofas, amidst swelling
pillows that might have defied the frosts of January; while seven or
eight hot-looking children were commanded to walk round the circle
and kiss every body.
Nor did the gentlemen fare much better; for scarcely had the
drawing-room door closed after the ladies, before the shining ald-
head of Dr. Crackley stretched itself up nearly to a loevel with the
long -backed Sir Matthewv's breast-pin, whilst, with a very ominous
sort of growl, making itself heard before his lips opened, hce first
preluded, and then uttered the following speech.
1 don't like it, Sir Matthew.-I don't like this business at the
Weavers' Arms.''
 What business, Doctor ?'' replied his fiend sharply.
 WVh this meeting, Sir Matthew. I can't get the notion of a strike
out of my head.'' Eery chair was drawn towards the little doctor : no-
body had heard a word of it. e Well, gentlemen, perhaps I am mis-
taken-perhaps there has been no meeting,'' resumed the friendly
doctor. God knows, I don't wish to spoil the enjoyment of this
dclightfal hour: but at any rate, my geod friends, it is as well for
you to be on the look-out.'' Then lowering his voicc, he muttered,
as near to the ear of Sir Matthew as he could reach,  I knows that
your people are meeting, in doors and out of doors. But you are
such a good, generous, kind-hearted creature, that I dare say we
shall hear, before long, of your having done some d-d good-
natured thing or other, and that perhaps will set all right;: who
knowe2'
Si Matthew gave an almost imperceptible nod, and pushed on
the claret-jug: but the gaiety of the party had been efectually
checked, and it was not long before the second richest man in com-
any (Sir Matthew of course being the first) said,  Ido think and

belicve, Sir Matthew, that my lady's caflee would do more to cool
ns than your wine.'' The opinion was not opposed, and, much
earlier than usual, the gcentlemen rose, and followied the ladies.
But this movement did not appear greatly to increase the cnjoy-
ment of either party. It was near nine o'clock, but the heat con-
tinued to be most oppressive, and the company being faor the most
part massive in all ways, their union prduced more additional ca-
loric than gaiety. The whole process seemed to have the power of
turning the hours into molten lead ass they passed, a portion
of which appeared to drop, and weigh heavily on ench individual
heal. In vain Sir Matthew made the circuit of the company,
pausing in front either of the richest or handsomest ladies, as duty
or inclination' preponderated; in vain he uttered his newest puns
and freshest bon-mots-not one of them had strength to laugh,
bcyond a little feehle `he, hel'' and even that was evidently a
painful effort.
Things were in this state, when Lady Clarissa Shrimpton suddenly
rose from the silken couch amidst whose pillows she was im-
bedded, and, without explaining her intentions to my Lady Dowling,
or any one else, darted through the open French-window, and out
;..-
ignorant of the rank of Lady Clarissa, he must from that moment
have fclt an innate conviction that she was somebody; for nobody that
was not somebody could have vehtured upon so daring an escapade
from such a solemn presence-chamber.' The effect it produced was
electric. Sir Matthew darted across the room with the eagerness ofa
man of gallantry and gaiety. He piqued himself upon being, of all the
great men in the neighbourhood the one upon whom Lady Clarissa
bestowed the most attention. His estimate of the outward advan-
tages of his extensive person was indeed not a low one; and, despite
all his lady could do to ecrush such an odious idea, he was conscious
that he was dcvoted to the fair sex, and flattered himself that the
fair sex was naot ungrateful. In fact, his general manner to ladies
had a good deal of what in female slang is called swaining,: but to
Lady Clarissa it was certainly something more. Had she been simply
Miss Shrimpton, it is prbable that, notwithsstanding her great
mental advantages, she would never ave been exposed to the
danger of this fascinating distinction, for she was nearly forty years
old, had a sharp nose, and was deplorably thin. But Sir Matthew
was not a man to be insensible to the charm of getting talked of in
the neighbourhood about his devsotion to Lady Clarissa any body,
even had she been a skeleton with aGorgon's hcad. There was,
however, independently of her bewitching title, a charm in her con-
versation and character, to which the knight was peculiarly sensible
Her ladyship was celebrated for her davotion both to literature and
art; and she permittcd all the world to know, for indeed she never
ceased to repeat it, that talent of every kind was to her an object of
idolatry. Now Sir Matthew knew that he was full of talent-poe-
HE LIRE AND ADVNTUE
tical talent, pictorial talent, epigramnmatic talent, every kinl of talent,
and it was certainly very delightful to be appreciated by such a
uperior creature as Lady Clarissa. So strongly indeed did this
intellectual sympathy between them occasionally manifest itsclf,
that not cven the slarp elbows and red-tipped nose of the noble
lady, who, to borrow the phrase of an iniitable describer, was in
eery sense ``preter-blue perfect,'' could render Lady Dowling
Wie easy respccting the nature of the friendship. Nor was it
without soething like a pang that she marked the sudden alacrity
of muyement with which Sir Mlatthew now strode across the floor to
accampany Lady Clarissu in the extraordinary frolic which led her,
in white satin shoes and a gauze dress, to exchange the drawing-
room for the garden, at nine o'clock in the eening.
IBt upon this occasion, as upon many others, Lady Dowling
found consolation in the well-known fact, that Lady Clarissa rarely
moved a step without being obsequiously attended by her humble
ceupanion, Mliss Mogg. This young lady had been selectcl to f6ll
her prescnt enviable situation, principally from her appearance,
though she was indeed by no means oid of many other qualifica-
tions admirably suited to it. But in appearance she was a striking
contrast to her tall and slender patroness: and, notwithistanding
Lady Clarissa's mental superiority, she was not insensible to the
alvuntage of having a foil that should set off the charms upon
which she particularly prided herself. Lndy Clarissa had a thin,
narrow faot, and an ancle that resembled nothing so much as the
leg of a Robin red-breast; the person of Miss Mlogg was supported
on shafts that told her axon origin, and feet that need not have
shrunk from sustaining an ox ILady Clarissa's slender waist might
have been cncireled by a ring of six inches diameter; a cestus of
nearly double the span had often gone nigh to suffocate her plump
companion. The.throat of Lady Clarissa had not only all the flexile
length of the swan's, but might een be said to resenble that of the
stork ia its proportions; while the head of Miss Mlogg was separated
from her shoulders by an interval so trifling, as hardly to be percep-
tible atall. The hair of her ladyship, though not very abndant,
was as black as ink, and its straight nature enabled her to lay  it in
classic ands upon her forehead, furishing a graceful foundation
for the wreath of oak lcaves with whicl, in judicious imitation of
Domenichino's exquisite head of Sappho, she usually adorned herself
when in full dress: while Miss MIogg, on the contrary, had a bushy
abundance of flaxen curls, which gavea round fussy sort of contour
to her face, that could not fail of setting off to advantage the severer
outline of the noble lady; and, in a word, the contrast was alto-
gether perfect.
To the great satisfaction of Lady bDowling, this round little per-
onagc arose, as usual, when her principal rose, and waddled to the
window after her. MIany people are apt to overlook and forget
companions, and the poor toady is as much used to be trod upon as
the despisel reptile whose name she ears. But if the world in

As he uow hastened to ofer his hand to Lady Clarissa in order
to assist her in stepping over the winlow-sill, he very nerly over-
trned Mliss Mogg as he passed her; but heeding neithcr  the re-
sistance her plump person offered to his passing clbow, nor yet the
timid ohI' which spoke her alarm, he hurried onward, and,
manfully seizing the hand whose touch was honour, walked ot
side by side with the titled lady upon the lawn.

clever Lady Clarissa is1 Such a delicious refreshmentt'' s To be
sure, it is the only thing in the world to do on such an evening
as this,'' exclaimed Miss Brotherton: who, as being the richest
ong lady in company, very pronerly thought she ought to speak
first, I am sure I shall follow her example:'' and so saying, she
rose and walked tawards the window. Three of the most daunt-
less ladies in the party started up to follow her; which, strange as
the manceuvre appeared to the full-dressed Lady Dowling, she did
not oppose, greatly preferring that the garden party should be
enlarged. But, though not byher, the adventurous fair ones were
stopped before they accomplished their lesign, hy a chorus of re-
monstrances from all the rest of the company, male and female.

one.

a third.

fourth.
``And your blonde dress, Mrs. Simpkins:'' vociferated a fiftth;
with a vast deal more in the same strain. So that before the sortie
was accomplished, eery lady, save Miss Brotherton, yielded before
the storm of reasons that pelted-them on all sides. The rich young

laly, however, stood firm: what `young lady with twro hundred
thousand pounds would not l
Mr. Augustus Dowling,'' said she, still pursuing her way
window-ward, but pausing ere she stepped out, `' will ou have
the excessive kindness,--vraiment j'ai honte,; but will you have the
charity to look in the hall for my pink satin mantelet, trimmed with
swansdown; without it I fear my poor little shoulders will be
arroses-` too rudely, alas l' with the dews of night,''
Now the young lady's shoulders were really very pretty little
shoulders, and, moreover, Mr. Augustus Dowling, notwithstanding
all his elegant nonchalance, perfectly well rememhered that she
had twohundred thousand pounds: so, before she had stamped with
her litle foot twice, in her impatience to join those who, from thein
gaiety, seemed to be so greatly enjoyiog the fresh air, he returned
with the mantelet, and having, as usual, adjusted his glass in the
corner of his eye to prevent his making any mistakes, placed it on
her shoulders.
` Now, then :1'' she cried, `` give me your arm. Is not this gool
fun ?
The young gentleman obeyed, declaring it wvas deligltful, and in
a moment they were beside Lady Clarissa and Sir Matthew: good
Miss Mlogg keeping a step or twso behind.
 Nobody bu your ladyship had wit enough to finl out that
there was more air to be got out of doors than in,'' said the heiress,
enturing te pass her arm through that of her noble friend. But,
upon tlis occasion, Lady Clarissa, thogh particularly intimate
with Mliss Brotherton, and seldom refusing to use her carriage and
act as her chaperone to all the parties in the neighbourhood, seemed
inclined to check her advances.
Miy dear child,'' said she, I am elighted to see you come
out. I am sure you must have been half stifled, as well as myself.
But you and Mr. Augustas must wander away hy yourselves, and
you may take Mogg with you, if you like it, for lhave just got into
a discussion with Sir Matthew, that I would not break off for the
world. So away with you, my dear, as fast as you can.''
ILady Clarissa's will was of course law, even to the heiress, but
it was not without a little toss of the head that she turned off to
another walk; nor was it without a considerable struggle between
her inclination and a sense of propriety, which, all things consi-
dered, really did her honour, that she permitted poor MIiss MIogg
to obey the hint of her patroness, and follow after.
`' And so you really have not seen this gifted young man yet, Sir
Matthew 7'' resumed her ladyship, as soon as they were again alone.
 You have never yet seen this Osmund Norcal ?''
No, my lady, I have not,'' replied the knight;` and to say the
truth,'' headded, venturing to press with his stout arm the slender
one that rested on it, `` to say the truth, though I hae heard a
monstrous deal about him, I was determined that I would have
notling to say to him, till I had heard your opinion, my lady,''

How kind1 how flattering, Sir Matthew1 But you will let
me bring him to you now 2''
 I1 I?'' (again prcessing the lean arm.)  Fancy me saying
no, when you tell me to say yesl Ahl my lady, you know better
than that, or Il am greatly mistaken.''
 Oh1 Sir Matthew, you are always so kind1 What magnificent
gardens you have1 IBy the way, I think I never tasted such a pine
as that we had to-day. I assure you, my brother, Lord Highland-
loch, is celebratel for his pines-quite celebrated. They are the
finest in all Scotland, but I give you my honour, I never saw one
equal to it athis table.''
Oh1 my ladly, that is only your amiable condescension,'' repliel
Sir Matthe, greatly touched by this preference.  But if you
really can be so polite as to think them good, I must entreat you
just to let me knock at the head-gardener's door, who lives close
outside this gate. I don't let him live inside, because of his
children, Lady Clarissa. I know what birds peck the worst-ha!
ha ha1 However, yO must just let me pass through the gate t
tell him to put up a bracce for your ladyship. They shall be well
taken care of now,my lady, trust me for that; I never valued them
so much before, I promise you.''
`You are too kind a thousand times '' said the lady, stretching
out her own and to opon the gate.  I will go with you; there is
nothing I doat upon like visising a gardener. Could he not take
us into the hot-houses, Sir Matthew? You have no idea how I
hould enjoy it.''
By no means displeased to show off tha high-born lady upon his
arm, even to the eyes of his gardener, the knight joyfully assentel
to the proposal.
Macnab I' he cried, knocking as he passed the cottage-wia-
dow,  Macnabl come here directly, and bring a knife and a
basket with you: you must come directly-this very moment, and
unlock the hot-houses-her ladyship wishes to walk through them,
and I must have one or two of the finest pines cut, and packed in a
basket, to be put into Mliss Brotherton's carriage: but mind, they
are for Lady Clarissa Shrimpton: so you had better give them in
charge to her ladyship's own man.''
Mr. Alexander Macnab promptly left the seeds he was sortiag,
anl prepared himself, basket in hand, to follow his master. The
knight and the lady left the cottage, arm-and-arm togcther; but
before they again enterel the garden, a fancy seized her lively lady-
ship, that a short ramble in the green lane outside it would be the
most agreeable thing in the world.
`Dcarnel what a poetical idea:'' exclaimed Sir Matthew with
enthusiasm.  There's only one thing,'' he said, stopping short,
``but that will spoil my pleasure altogether: I am so dreadtiully afraid
that your ladyship will take eold.''
`Ask the gardener's wife to lend me one ofr her kerchiefs,'' sail
Lady Clarissa, laughing. But t yill only be to satisy yo, Sis
Matthew, for there is no catching cold in such weather as this.''

HE LIFE AND ADYETDRES
It was with something quite iike tender anxiety that the knight
stepped back, asked for nnd obtained a neat shawl, and himself
wrapped it round the slender person of his amiable companion.
 Thank youl thank you a thousand times: But, dear Sir Mat-
thew, 1 must not lose my pines by my frolic: will you give the gar-
dener orders to get them without waiting for us? and perhaps y
would let him put up a bunch of granes, and a few peaches at the
same time-it is no god to let him wait for us, Sir Matthew ;--when
you and I get intno a chat together, we shali neither of us think of
the pines again.''
Quitting her highly-valued aristocratiec arm for an instant, the
flattered knight ran back and gave the necessary orders: and then,
almost unconscious, in his full contentment, that his own gray head
was as bare as that of the oak-crowned nymph by his side, he re-
turued tohis bewitching companion and led her gently onward over
the mossy turf that bordered the road.
The gardener and his wife stood cgether for a moment looking
after them. e Who would think now that she was one of the true
old gentlefolks, and Scotch to boot, to scee her pair off that way with
our rogue of a spinner there? How, in God's name, can she choose to
be so free and friendly with such as he?'' said the garlenen
 Just for the same reason as yourself, Sawny,'' replied his wife;
 to get nll she can out of him.''
' And that's true,'' replied Sawny, setting off upon his business.
I had like to forget the pines, and the grapes, and the peaches.
She's not so far wrong after all; and yet 'tis a pity, too.''
The evening was still oppressively sultry, and hardly a breath of
air disturbed either the leaves on the oaks beside the road, or those
that mimicked them so abominably on the lady's brow; but, never-
theless, there was a freshness in the smell of the hedges and the grass,
which could not fail to be agreeable to any nerves that had endured
the steaming dinner, and the irksome drawing-room of Dowling
Lodge
Ihe shady lane in which the knight and the lady were thus re-
creating themselves, after skirting the extensive and lofty walls of
the garlen, turned at right angles both to the right and the left at
the corner of it. The branch to the loft followed the boundary of
the garden, and led to the stable-yard and back entrance to the
house; that to the right cbnducted to the factory, which was the
source and head-spring of All the wealth that flowed over, and irri-
gatel with its fructilying stream, meadows, parks, hot-beds and
lower-gardens, till it made itself a prodigious cistem in the depths
and heights of Dowling edge.
When the strangely-matched pair came to this point, Sir Matthew
made a halt, till lady Cluarissa came to the end of a little poem,
which the protege whom she was so desirous of introducing to her
rich and (to use her own words) `` really very clever friend,'' had in-
scribed in her album.
Nothing could be more agreenable toher ladyship than this pause.

In the first place it was the greatest possible relief to her lung6, for
the lines she was reciting were much too full of icep feeling to be
repeated without a pninful effort, wliile walking; and in the second,
the halt, accompanied as it was by a look of earuest attention from
her apparently-delighted companion, furnished the most agreeable
commentary in the world upon the poem itself, as well as on her
manner of reciting it.
It suaid so plainly, `` tay -move not l-lest a word, an intona-
tion, a cadence, be lost to me:''
Lady Clarissa was rcally touched by it; and let Sawny the gar-
dener, and his wife Janet, say or think what they would, neither
peaches nor pines had any thing to do with the gratification she at
this moment experienced in the society of the great manufacturer.
Ilis cyes were fixcd on her face, and she bore the gaze, and
returned it with that sort of courage and confidence, which genuine
enthusiasm alone can gte
She had just finished a stanza when Sir Matthew ceased to move,
and feeling that he did so under the intluence of a spell, which she
well knew would be morc powerful still were it spoken when she
ere at rcst-for Lady Clarissa was aware that she was exceedingly
short-breathed-she repeated the last eight lines in a manner that
showed she felt the pleasure she was producing-a pleasure, as she
thought, like that occasionally causcd by the repetition of some
delicious phrase in a musical composition, reiterated as if to fll the
soul with its sweetness.
`And should the eye for whieh I write

Of hones that trembliag. fltering. imid,

The tear askced for, almost came as she ceased.
 You feel it, dear Sir hatthewI'' she said, in a voice of consider-
able emotion.
d hug my chain, and call it dear1''-she again murmurel,
hanging on his arm with such an evident degree of weakness, as
showed the slender form to be less powerful than the ardent spirit
it enshrined.
Let us turn bnaek,'' said Sir Mathew.  My dear friend,''
faintl ejaculated ady Clarissa, `` you are moved too strongly--
But-no, no: Sir MatthewI bBelieve me, it were far better for both
of us that we should proceed.-Are we, cither of us,. my dear friend,
in a state at thismoment to meet the curious stare of idle eyesl--

as she spoke-`` this sott glade invites us.''
Though pertfectly determined to find some excuse for not leading
his fascinating companion within sight of his grim-looking factory,
which unother turn in the lane at no great distance would have
made very unpicturesquely vyisible, it was impossible at that moment

The youngest, but by far the stoutest and tallest of the two boys,
instantly obeyed this command, and placing himself midway be-
tween the tormented cow and the fair creature, whose nerves her
menacing attitude had so cruelly shaken, he stood manfully astride
in the middle of te lane, flourished his ragged hat on high, and
with a few lusty `` wough1 woughsI'' repeated at the top of his
yeng voice, succeeded in turning the front of the enemy, which
was presently seen to wheel round, and, by a sort of feeble, ambling
little trot, speedily got out of sight round the corner.
 Now, then,'' said Sir Matthew, ``let me leal you hoeme, my dear
ladyi'
 Not till I have thanked my little dliverer,'' exclaimed Lady
Clarissa, with very sentimental fervour. e Good heaven what
might have been my fate without him t I know-I feel, Sir Matthew,
that you never could have borne to leave me, and what then could
have stopped the fearful approach of that most vicious animal?-
Death, or worse than death-dislocation of limb, disfigurement of
featuro: Oh, Sir Matthew, your heart, I know, will go side by side
with mine. Tell me, what can I do-what can we both do, to reward
the astonishing bravery of that noble little fellow ?
Depend upon it, my laly, he will he delighted if you will give
him sixpeuce.''
 Sixpence 1'' cried her lalyship, turning extremely red,-but in a
moment she recovered herself and said: `' Oh1 Sir Matthew: do Inot
know how dearly you love a jest? Men of witand humour can rarely
be grave for long together, even under circumstances that most keenly
touch their feelings; did I not know you well, my friend, what
should I not think of your proposul But come, come-be serious
for a moment longer : we have, it is true, escaped a tremendous
danger, and it may well make us feel light at heart: but we will not
laugh over it, till we have settlod in what way that heroic child
shall receive the meed he has eamned. I shall not rest in pece, my
friend, unless his destiny be as faoirably influenced by me, as
mine has probably been by him. Sir Matthew, you have great
power, enormous wealth, a generous heart, a noble nature, and in-
tellect, before whieh, if I mistake not, all difficulties will melt away
like a mist before the sun. Of all this I am quite certain. There
is but one r in the business. Ir you value me, Sir Matthew, as much
as I think you do, that little boy now getting over the gate will bo
clothed, educated, fed, lodged by you. Do I deceive myself'? or will
the daily sight of him, by renewing the memory of this evening,
rather cause you pleasure than pain ?''
Sir Matthew Dowling clearly saw, that sending ``the little black-.
guard to the deil,'' which was decidedly what his heart whispered
to him, would, at this stage of the business, he inevitably sending
her sentimental ladyship to at least an equal distance from himself;
and this he had no inelination to do. She ws the only Lady Some-
body Something in the whole neighbourhood, and he was quite aware
that he had already acquired more envy and hatred among his
friends and neighbours, by the superior degree of intimacy he had

contrived to achieve with her, than by all his successful struggles
to outspend them all.
This pleasure was not to be given up for a trifle, especially at a
moment wrhen it seemed so very clear that it only denended on him-
self to make all the world percoive that they were dearer friends
than ever; so, making a virtue of necessity, he looked in her face
with one of his wittiest smiles, and cleverly taking the cue she had
given, repliced--y 1f you had ot found out that I was jesting with
you, ILady Clarissa, I neer, should have believed in your fricndship
more: Come here, my boy,'' he continued, raising his ioud voice to
a note that must have been heard as far as the factory, ` come here,
1I say.'
The little fellow, on hearing these imperative accents, which were
not quite unknown to him, thought this was the first time he had
been so greatly honoured as to have them addressed to himsclf,
again let go the hand of his brother, by whose side he had begun to
resume his progress homeward, and once more clambering over
the gatc presented himself, cap in hand, before the illustcious
pair.
 You are a happy little boy,'' said Lady Clarissa, ``in having had
the extraordinary good fortunc of looking over yonder gate at the
moment you did; and you are a brave little fellow into the bargain
for not running away, as you certainly might have done, when you
saw .that dreadful east. Oh I thosc tremendous horns, Sir Matthew 1

my head on my pillow without dreaming of them. But you droe
them away, my deatr child, and as a reward for it, you shall be com-
fortably clothed and fed for the rest of your life. You will like that,
won't you?''
I should very much like never to go to work at the factory any
more,'' repliced the child; ` hut, please ma'am,'' he added the mdinute
after, `I'd sooner you'd clothe and feed Teddy than me. He looked
ovor the gate first, please ma'am.''
 Did he, my dear7 Then that is another reason why this good
gentleman's favour should be shown to you: for if your brother saw
my distress first, it was yon who were the first to relieve it,''
:That was only because Teddy is so lame, please ma'am,'' said
the boy.

Micehael Armstrong: Ishall not forget it, I assure you: for truly
do I believe that I should hae been trampled in the dust by this
time, if you had not been heart-strong as well as Armstrong. And
what shall we do with him at first; Sir Matthew ? Shall we take
him home with us ?'
 WVhat: to your cottage, my dear lady 2-Yes, certainly, if it
will give you plcasure.''
My dearest Sir Matthew1 there you are at your jestings
again.''
HaI hal ha1 Lady Clarissa, you begin to know me so well,
that I shall never be able to cut my little dry jokes upen you,'' re-
plied the knight laughing, as it seemed, most heartily, but inwvardly
cursing the audacious exaction of his fuir friend, in attempting to
make him pay the enormous price she hinted at, for permitting him
to enjoy the honour and glory of flirting with her. The idea of
being thus entrapped, and forced to adopt `` ua bag of rags out af
his own fsctory'' (for it was thus he inwardly designtel little
Michael), galled him for a moment so severely, that he was within an
ace of exclaiming, ` Confound yo, and the eggar's brat together,
you old fool ?'' Bnt, most fortunatelyfor all parties, helid no such
thing: on the contrary, he happily remembered at that critical
momcnt the important hints he had received from his cxcellent
friend Dr. Crockley, and instantly decided `'` that this absurd whim
of her ladyship's should be worked up iuto the d-d good-natutred
thing that was to set all right.''
At the very same moment, as if to confirm his resolution, Lady
Clarissa rew from her pocket a cambric pocket-handkerchief,
somcthing the worse for wcar, perhaps, but most elaborately em-
broidered at each corner with the cnronet of a countess, lt was
one of a dozen bequenthed to her a few years before by her thrifty
and truly admirable mother, the late Countess of Ilighlandloch.
This coincidence appeared to be the work of Providence.
Give me your arm, my charming friend I'' said the well-satisfied
kniglt, with an air of tender gallantry, ``and only remember, that
all 1 shall do in this busines, will proceed wholly from my devoted
friendship to you. Follow us, little oy, and you shall learn what
it is to have served Sir Matthew Dowling's most honoured friend.''
Having said this, he began leading his fair companion back
towards the house as rapidly as might be consistent with the delicate
style in which she was shod.
Please na'am, may I go and tell Teddy?'' said liule Michael,
walking after them.
 elly ?-who is Teddy, my little man?'' inquired ILaly CIa-
rissa, graceiously smiling upon him; for her ladyship, atno time
an ill-natnred woman, was at this moment in the best of all possible
humours with hersellf, and every body else. There had been.

celebrated for the warmth of his devotion to the fair sex. But for
this, she must not be out of measure blamed, inasmuch as those
who have reached the age for looking on upon the drama of life,
can many of them testify that in this she only yieldcd to a weak-
ess very unaccountably common to the majority of the sex.
But poor liutlc Michael Armstrong has been left unmercitully
long, looking up inher lalyship's smiling face, as she inquired who
Teidy was.
 Teldy is my brother, please ma'am,'' was his answer.
``Is he still vaiting for you at the gate, my dear?'' said the laly.
 I don't see him.''
: He can't stand very well, ma'am, because he is lame,'' replied
Michael.I shouldn't wonder if he was set down, and gone ta
sleep.''
Gone to sleepl-why it is hardly bedtime yet, my dear, is it
However, I suppose he had hctter go to see, Sir Matthew ?-Your
brother,'' turning again to the child, `' is younger than you are, l
svppose, if he falls asleep on the grass like a baby. Is he old
enough to go home by himself, and tell the great news that has
happened to you ?'
``Taddy is two years older than me-only he is always so tired,''
repliel the boy.
 WVell, then, just step back, and bid him run along home by
himself, and tell all the family what a fine act you have done, and
that Sir MIatthew Dowling is going to take care of you all the rest
of your lifte,''
Michael now, for the first time, ventured to look steadily up into
the face of the majestic Sir Matthew, and his little heart sank with-
in him. It was quite evident from the child's speaking-countenance,
that no pleasurable ideas were suggested, by the assurance that Sir
Matthe would take care of him all the rest of his lite. The knight
saw this, and would for a moment have desired no better sport than
wringing his neck round; nevertheless, he patted his hcad with as-
tonishing condescension, and said, ` It is quite true, my boy. For
the sake of this charming lady, ifor whose happiness you must pray
morning, noon, and night, 1 will undertake to provide for yo.
You may step back, if you will, and tell your brother so, who, if he

Is not she your friend, my poor child?'' demanded Lady Clarissa
in an accent of great feeling.
' Please ma'am, she is my mother,'' answered Michael, while a
slight flash mantlel his pale cheek, and something like a tear
twinkled in his eye-
How very oldI'' exelaimed Lady Clarissa. ' Is she not kind
to yo, my boy ''
Kind3'' responded Michael, staring at her.

TnE LIFE AD ADv ENTURE
 Do you love her, my little fellow t''
 Love her?'' again echoed Michael.
 Whatever she is, she has not taught you good manners, my
lad, or you would nut answer her lalyship this way,'' said the
knight rather indignantly.
The little boy was certainly very foolish, for, large as his eyes were,
they could not contain the salt rheu which, for no reason in the
world that the lady or gentleman could guess, first filled thcm and
then ran down in two great big drops upon his cheeks.
1 dare say he is hungry,'' exclaimed Lady Clarissa with sudden
animation.  How delightful, dearest Sir Matthew, to have found
a little creature so greatly in wantl Are you hungry, my dear?
Tell the truth-don't be afraid.''
 Not ery,'' said the child.
 Poor liule fellow l-It is quite evident, Sir Mlatthew, that he is
exceedingly shy. Let us go back, shall we 2-just as far as the
gate, and give the messge ourselves to that lazy fellow that he says
is asleep under the hedge-and two years older than this one.-
Only conceive1-I am delightel that he is not to he the object of
your bounty, for there is nothing so detestable as idleness.''
Sir Matthcw had turned in compliance with the word and action,
which expressed her ladyship's desire that he should do so, and in.
another minute they reached the gatc.
 wVhere is this brother of yours ?-I don't sec him,'' said Lady
Clarissa, looking about.
There he is, ma'am, if you please,'' replied Michael, once more
climbing over the gate: and presently he was close under the
flowery hcdge, extending his two hands to raise a miserably sick-
looking child, who was, in truth, soundly sleeping there. In con-
sequence of a few words whispered to him by little Michel, the
boy came forward with a shuffling gait, his knees slopning inwards,
and his legs frightfully emaciated: but the moment he reached the
gate, ILady Clarissa exclaimed,  Good gracious 1 how beautiful I'
It was indeed a losely face that was then turned up to meet hcr
eye: and whcen, as if somewhat daunted by her earnest gaze, he
removed his own from her conntenance to that of Sir Matthew, the
bright flash that lighted it up for a moment made it appear more
beautiful still.
And what is your name, my pretty boy ?'' said the lady.
 Edward Armstrong,'' was the reply.
But, my dear clhnild, you don't look well, and you ought not to
go to sleep so, quite late in the evening, upon the grass. What
makes you so very sleepy, my dear? Have you been at play 2
 No, na'am,'' replied the boy, furtively glancing at Sir Mauthew,
I have been at work.''
At work1 You can't have done much work, my poor little
fellow, looking as you do.''

off, and I am sure yon will be quite chilled if you remain any longer
out of doors.''
I believe you are right, my dear friend,'' said Lady Clarissa,
with a glance of naffeetionate gratitude for this earnest zeal. ` Let
s go. Never can I forget the kindness you have shown me luring
this eventful walk, and heartless indeed must I be were I to refuse
to aeknowledge that it has made a deep impresslion on me.''
For a moment Lady Clarissa held her coroneted handkerchief to
her eyes, and then resumed, ee Go home, little Edward-tell your
mother, who, by the by, I trust is not harsh to you, that your brother
MIichael is rewarded for an act of bravery that probably saved the
Iife of an easrl's daughter-has been most generously and nobly
adopted by her friend Sir Matthew Dowling, and that henceforward
shc need have no anxiety whatever on his account. Now, then, Sir
Matthew, I am ready.''
` Are we never to see Michael again ?'' said the lame boy, while
a sudden expression of anguish passed aeross his beautiful features.
e Why not, child ?' replied her ladyship rather sharply.  Do
yo suppose that Sir Matthew and I arc going to hide him?'
It is all very well then,'' returned Edward, limpig away.
:But be sure to go and tell mother all about it yourself to-morrow,
MIle
 Come alng, little onet'' said ILady Clarissa, moing off.
Follow behind this generous gentleman, and see the palace of a
home which your hravery has won.''
So sayig, she movel on; the obsequious knight at her side, and
the wondering Michael Armstrong afer her.
On rcachiug the gate beside the gardener's house, Sir Matthew
paused. He had been meditating, while seemingly listening in rapt
attention to the lady's talk, on the effect which would be produced
on the party they were about to rejoin, by the appearance of the
ragged little companion they had brought back with them.
Hal he been a ragged sailor-boy, or a ragged plough-boy, or
evcn a ragged chimney-sweeper, there migbt by possibility have been
excitel some feeling of curiosity and interest; ut aragged factory-
boy was of all created beings the one lceast likely to give birth to
such emotions, among his friends and neighbours, or indeed to any
other emotion fit to be exhibited in good society. So, merely saying
to his fir friend,  Excuse me, my lady, for one moment,'' he once
more knocked at the cottage-window, and callel aloud for Mac-
nabt
The obedient North riton appeared immediately, and was about
to forestal the inquiry he anticipated by assurances that her lady-
ship's pines, peaches, and grapes, hat all been consigned to the care
of her ladyship's own serving-man, when he was ery literally struck
dumb by his master saying--
Macnab, take this little boy into the servants' hall, and tell the
servants to take care of him--do you hear-and he is to hae a
hed made up for him, and-and supper, and breakfast-and all that;
and to-morrow I will talk to Parsons about what mustbe done for him.

TE LIFE AND ADYETURES
Observe, Mlacnab, and take care, if you please, that all the servants
about the place know it, that this boy is to be the object of the
greatest beneolence,''
 The greatest-what was you pleased to say, sir?'' said the
Scotch gardener, really and truly doubting his own ears.
BEEoLECE, sirI' shouted the knight vehemenily; '` and

 How inspiring is this angelie goodness,'' exclaimed Lady Clarissa
affectionately. `` Ah, Sir Mlatthew1 how few there are who kno

 Come along, my man,'' said the Scotchman, leading aay
Michael; and he said no more till he was quite sure that the knight
and the lady had got far eneugh in their progess across the garen,
to be out of hearing, and then he aldel: ` And now, my litte
fellow, tell me in Gol's name what all this means  Why, you look
for all the world like one of the little raggamuffins out of the
factory.''

Michael.

 So, then, ou don't understand it much better than I do, it
seems? But what did he say it was for? He didn't take the Earl
of Highlandloch's daughter among the infernal whirligigs, did he,
and pick you out as a specimen to be kept in a glass case ?''
t 1I hope he von't put me in a glass case, sir,'' said Michael, taking
courage from the gardener's good-humour; ``but why he brought me
here at all, I don't very well understand. The lady said it was be
cause I held up my hat, and cried  Wough:' to bDame kuight's old
cow : but of course she was only making fun,''
'At any rate, he was makiog n fun, for he roared like a bull-

and if it brings you food and lodging, I lon't suppose you'll break
your heart for being taken out of the factory-shall you?''
2 Not if he'll take Edward out too,'' said the boy.
 Edward out too: OhI1 Lord, oh: Lord, how many more?
Did he cry  Wough:' to the cow, oo2
1I wish he had !' said Michael, shaking his head very myste-
riously.
Meanwhile Lady Clarissa and the gallant knight re-entered my
Lady Dowling's drawing-room, amidst a perfect storm of questions,
exclamations of admiration, wonder, fears for the lady's safety, and
so forth.
Miss Brotherton, who always took more liberties than any one
else, laughed immoderately; Lady Dowling looked the picture of

usual amiable attention, put a footstool uuder the lady's misused
white satin shoes, took MIrs. Janet Miacnab's shawl off her shoulders,
and whispered in her enr, that she was dreadfully afraid she must
have caught cold.
IBut Lady Clarissa, with a liely action of both hands at once,
not only drove Mliss MNogg back, hut every one else who attempted
to crowd round her, saying, ` Give me spacel give me spaee, I
entreat youI I must have `ample room and verge enough' ta

But I give you my honour-I pledge my noble word to you all, that

Or the Earl of Warwick either, perlaps,'' said Miss Brotherton,
for she had heard Sir Matthew utter the word `'` cow,'' in answer to
the importunate inquiries of his eldest son.
 But what shall I say of Sir Matthew Dowling ?'' resumed Lady
Clarissa, with increased energy. `Such benevolencel such noble,
disinterestcd conduct :-No, I cannot-I really have no strength left.
Miss Brotherton, my dear, pray do order your carriage: my nerves

meditate in solitude on my providential escape.''
Here Lady Clarissa found it necessary to lie down upon a sofa,
her faithful Mogg endeavouring in vain to pull her dress over he
slender feet and ankles, for her ladyship was restless, feverish, and
unable to remain in the same attitude for a minute together.
Ere long, howeer, the carriage of the heiress was announced,
and the languid Lady Clarissa exerted herself to reach it, with the
aid of Miss Mogg's substantial arm on one side, and that of Sii
Matthew Dowling on the other.

osEII ARSONs,
WN Mr. MIacnab and his little companion entered the kitchen,
in their way to the servants' hall, to which place of honour the
wondering fcotchman rememered he had heen commanded to
conduct his charge, the first person they encountered was Mr.
Simkins, the butler, whom some accidental wish or want had led to
enter a region but rarely honoured by the sunshine of his pre-
sence.
Gool morning, Macnab. Whatl empty-handed I am afraid
you have forgotten the little basket of peaches I desired to
have; and upon my word, sir, if you leave it much longer, I shall
not consider them worth presenting to the lady for whom I desired
to have them. Be pleased to recoliect, good Mr. Sawney, that
when every garden-wall is hung with ripe fruit, a hottle of comfort
will he rather too high a price for a dozen.''
 Your discourse, Mr. Simkins, is neither civil nor discreet in any
way,'' replied the offended North bBriton:  my word, sir, is as good
as the bank, either in Englanl or Scotland; and it is heneath a
gentleman, to say nothing of your rank as a batler, Mr. Simkins,
to suspetet that lI should forget it,''
 Well, well, the sooner the better, that'sall. But who in God's
name have you got here ?''
 That is more than I am able to tell you, sir,'' replied Macnab.
:All I know about him is a mystery. Sir Matthew, and a lady that
was hardly born to be so free in his company, came to the garden-
house about an hour ago, and Sir MIatthew was as gay as a lark,
and ambled and smirked; while the Ilighlandloch's daughter, old
tfooll looked as well pleased as if she had been gallanted by the
Dake of Argylc. WVell, sir, he ordered a basket of the cloicest
and best for her ladyship, and it went against me, Mr. Simkins,
both ways-for first it ought to choke her, seeing who she is, and
who he is, and next l thought upon my promise to you, sir. IIow-
ever, and nevertheless, Mr. Simkins, I will keep my waord with you,
if it cost me a ton of coals more in the forcing.'
' But what's all this to do with your ragged companion there?
The child looks as if he was ready to drop. 1I1 et a bottle you
caught him thieving in the fruit-garden.''
The boy's colour rose on hearing these words. He spoke not, how-
ever,; but his large eyes were turned up to the face of his compa-
nion, and the fingers of his litle hand pressed the hard palm that
held thcm, alost convulsiely. Sawney undestood the appeal, and
answered it: for though, like many other gentlemen, his code of

honour was at some points a little ioosened and enlarged, to fit and
suit his individual circumstances, he felt the value of character as
much as any man; and promptly replied, in good Scotch, which
mnust, however, for sundry weighty reasons, be here translated into
English : : No, no, Mr. Butlerl no suech thing, I assnre you; the
lad's as honest as I am, for aught that I know to the contrary. But,
to make a short story of a long one, my lady walked off up the
lane, after borrowing a shawl from my wife, nnd your master with
her, MIr. Simkins, who but he-Well, I had picked the fruit, packed
it, and delivered it over to my lady's man, nnd was just set down
again to my seed-picking, when I heard Sir Matthew's big voice
again halloaing te me, and when I came out, there stood the ill-
srted pair, arm in arm together, as hefore, and this ragged chap
beside them.''
Well 1 and what then?'' ejaculated the portly butler, impa-
tiently.  What a long-winded man you are, Macnab.''
 Hoot, man '' retorted Macnab,  if you want the story, yo
mst just find patience to hear it. Take this boy to the servants'
hall,' sail Sir Matthew, quite upon the strut, ` and order supper and
a bed for him. 
To the servants' hall?'' repeated the indignant man of bottles,
measuring the little fellow from head to foot with an eye, which,
notwithstanding it was small and bloodshot, was eloquent of scorn.
 To the servants' hall? Sir Matthew will inflict his own company
upon us next, I suppose. Why, look at the cotton fluff mixed with
his hair1 He is neither more nor less than a factory-boy,''
 1o be sure he is,'' replied the gardener, shrugging his shoul-
ders, ` hut it's no fault of mine, Mr. Simkins; to the servants' hall I
must take him, right or wrong. Come along, hoy.''
``Stop one moment, if you please, Macnab. Let me step to Mrs.
Thompson's room, and speak one word to her about it. Sit down,
sit down, will you, for one moment.'' And away hurried Mr.
Simkins, scattering dismay as he traversed the pasages, by uttering
as he passed along to footmen and housemails, abigail and page,
`Go to the kitchen, do, in God's namel go and see the company
Sir Matthew has been ordering into the servants' hall .''
And away they flew, one after another, eager to see the wonder;
so that by the time Mr, Simkins himself returned to the kitchen,
marshalling the housekeeper before him, at least half-a-dozen ser-
vants had assembled there, all of whom were gazing at little
Michael, very much as if he had been caugght in a forest, and con-
veyed thither to gratify their desire of studying natural history.
 IVo is that dirty little boy, Macnab?'' aaid the maguificent
Mrs. Thompson, advancing to the spot where the gardener was
seated with his frightened charge standing beside him, and all the
lookers-on making way for her as she passed.
1t is a factory-boy sent here by Sir Matthew, Ms. Thompson,''
replied Macnab, while, forestalling, it may be, the storm likely to
follow the intclligence, he seemed to settle himself in the arm-chair
either to enjoy the fun, or abide the tempest.

of this extraorlinary scene, might be punishel with as little suffer-
ing as possible. Two sprightly housemaids seemed to find some-
thing vastly amusing in the whole business, though their evident
merriment was restrained by the solemnity of Mrs. Thompson's
mnanner.
t Look up in my face, little boy,'' said the housekeeper, as soon
as sle had seated herself and saw that those around her stood still,
as if they had taken their places, and were prepared to listen.
Michael did not move; he was probably ashamed to show that
he was weeping, before the face of a lady who spoke so very
grandly.
The kitchen-maid gave him a nudge, but a gentle one, whisper-
ing at the same time-'` Look up, my boy. What be you 'feard of1
There's nobody as wants to hurt you here,''
Thus encouraged, Michael let his arm drop by his side, and dis-
coered a face that was indeed sallow, and by no means very
plump, but with feastures andl expressian which, whatever Sir Mat-
thew Dowling's men and maids might think of it, might have suf-
ficed to make the faortune of an able painter.
 WVhose child are you?'' demanded the hosekeeper. : Mo-
ther's,'' replied the boy.
1 suspected as much,'' rejoined the inquisitor, half aside to Mr.
Jennings.
t And I beant no ways surprised to hear it, I promise you,'' he
replied.
Mrs. Thompson sighed deeply. :It is dreadful'' said she.
Then, after taking a moment to recover herself, she resumed,'` And
where does the unhappy person live ?''
Please, ma'am, whaot'' said the puzzled boy.
 The-your mother, child.-Shame upon you for forcing me ta
name her1''
MIichael gave a little shake of the head, which seemed to the
merciful kitchen-maid to say, that he did not know what the great
lady meant; but he presently replied, as if discreetly determined tod
mind only what he did understand, Mother lives in Iloxley Lane,
ma'am.''
The most deplorable situation in the whole parishl inhabited
only by the very lowest 1' observed the housekeeper, with another
indignant sigh.
eSo much the worse for she,'' muttered the kitchen-maid: but
not loud enongh to be heard by her in whose hands rested the
appointment of kitchen-maids as well as cooks.
 And why does such as you come here?'' resumed the house-
keeper.
iIBecause the squire ordered t'other man to bring me,'' answered
Michael.
I suspect that the boy is a natural fool,'' observed Mrs.
Thompson, adlressing the butler.  It is a sure fact, and a great
dispensation-bad parents have almost always children out of

of you,'' she added, looking round her; `` and you will do well to
teach it to your children after you.''
II1 he bumnt if I lon't think it very likely that it was his own
father sent him here, and no one else,'' said MIr, Jennings, chuckling.
Fie: Jennings, fiel'' returned Mrs. Thompson, with a frown.
God in heaven only knows what nay have been the cause of it.
--Not but what it does look strange, there's no denying that.''
Do you know any thing about your father, child ?' said Mr.,
Simkins in a magisterial tone.
Fathers in heaven,'' replied the child.
 Mercy on me: do you hear him? Is not that like mocking
the ILord's prayer?'' exclaimcd the lady's-maid.
No, it is not I' said Michael, while a flash of youthful indigna-
tion rushed into his face. : My fther is in heaven along with Gao.''
I lare say he means that his father is dead,'' observed the
buler with an air of great sagacity ; ` and if what has been jealoused
at is correct,'' he added, winking his eye at Mr. Jennings, '` it is
very natural that he shoull have been told to say so,''
That's very true,'' said the housekeeper, ``and it may be,
certainly, that the child knows nothing about it whatever, either one
way or t'other-inleed I think it's a good deal the most likely that
he does not;-but, ny how, it's a yery shocking business, and, as
far as I am concerned, Il1 neither make nor meddle in the
matter.-Of course, the men-servants may do jwst as they like about
taking notice of him-for here heis, and here he will bide, I dare sasy:
but lrecommend tho maids to follow my example, and not to injure
their characters, nor to corrupt their morals by having any thing to de
with the offspring of---It is more decent not to tinish what I was
geing to say for yer geeds. eung women,-and lucky it is that
there is no need. You must all undcrstand me without it.''
Mrs. Thompson then rose from her chair, and turning her eyes,
and indeed her head, aside, to prevent herself from again seeing
Michael, she walked with a degree of stateliness aud majesty that
few housckeepers ever attuined, through the kitchen, along the
pasage, across the servants' hall, into the sacred shelter of her own
parlour, where she gave way to emnotions which rendered a glass of
prime London Madeira absolutely necessary.
Meanwhile Mlichael remained in no very happy condition in the
kitchen. Ie was vcry tired, very sleepy, very thirsty, very much
longing to see his mother and brother, and very greatly puzzled
as to himself.
But though accounted to be a brave little fellow for his age, he
could not muster courage enough to ask any questions of those
around him, and if he had, it would have been of no uavail; for the
vcry moment Mrs. Thompson was out of sight, so many of the
servants began talking together, that no sounds his voice could
produce would have been heard.
Jokes and gibes about Sir MIatthew, mingled with ridiculous
anecdotes, and very cordial abuse of him and all his race, furnished

2I was a coming., sir, if you hadn't a sent for me,'' rejoined the
overlooker; ' for to say truth, my mind misgives me, that there's
mischief brewing.''
 I have heard as nuch,'' said the master; e but it can hardly
have gone very far yet, if such a sharp-sighted fellow as you only
suspect.''
eThat's true, sir,'' said the man, with a grim smile, in acknow-
ledgment of the compliment;  and 1've not been idle, I promise
you. ut all Iknow for certain is, that the people, old and young,
ou own people I mean, have, one and all, taken dudgeon about that
girl Stephens, that died the week before last, just after leaving the
mill. She had been at work all day in the spinning-mill, and who
was to guess that she was that low 2''
It was a d-d stupid thing though, Parsons, to have a girl go on
working, and not know whether she was dying or not,''
 And how is one to know, sir? I'Il defy any man to find out,
what with their tricks, and what with their real faintings.''
 You won't tell me, Parsons, that if you set your wits to work,
you can't tell whether they are shamming or not ?''
 That's not the question, Sir Mlatthew, asking your pardon.
There's no great difficulty in finding out whether they are in a real
faint, or only making the most of being a little sickish from stand-
ing, anl want of air. That's not the difficulty. The thing is to
know, when they really take to the downright faintings, whether
they are likely to live through it or not.''
` And where is the great difficulty of that? You know Dr.
Crockley would come at a moment's warning at any time, and feel
their pulses.''
And he does do it, sir. But, in the first plaee, I doubt if any
man can justly tell whether girls are likely to go on fainting, and
p again, as lots and lots of 'em do for years, or drop down and
die, as Nancy Stephens did. That's one thing; and another is,
tha Dr. Crockley is so fond of a joke, that 'tis rarely one knows
when he speaks earnest, and when he does not. He did see Nancy
Dtephens, about a month ago, and all he said was,` she do look
a litie pale in the gills, to be sure, but a dance would cure her, I
have no douht.' A dancel says l, doctor. And please to tell me,
says lI, how the work is to get on, if the factory boys and girls sets
of dancing?'
 Maybe you havren't got a fiddle1''' said he.
 Maybe I haven't,'' said I.
  Well, then,' says he, ` if it don't suit you to let them dance to
the fidle, 1'l1 bet ten to one you'll be afer making 'em dance to
he strap.' And with that, if youll believre me, sir, he set off caper-
iong, and making antics, just as if there had been somebody hehind
a-strapping him. To be sure, it was fit to make one die of laughing
to see him; but that's not the way you know, sir, to do one any
gool as to finding out the real condition of the people.''

Sir Matthew could not resist a hearty laugh at this characteristic
trait of his friend, but he concluded by acknowledging that Parsons
was quite right in saying that this way of doing business was more
agreeable than useful.
However, Parsons,'' he continued, `` we must not talk about
that now, for I have something else to say to you. It is quite plain
that they are getting again to their grumblings: and Crockley,
who you know is up to every thing, says that he'll bet his lifa
they have got some new mischief into their cursed heads.
Now this must be prevented, Parsons, some way or other; for any
harm they can do the machinery, is not the worst of it.-'Tis the
rousing up people's attention again, Parsons, there's the danger.-
Just see what they've done about the blacekamoor slaves, by going
on boring for everlasting, ding-dong, ding-dong, till they actually
got the thing done at last. Now the Philadelphy people and the
lBoston people are just playing the very same game t'other side the
water: and when they have got their way, where will their national
wealth be I shonld like to know2-And where will our national
wealth be, when these rascnls have contrivel to stop the mills in-
stead of working them 2''
Lord have mercy pon us Sir Matthew;-if you don't make
me creep all over to hear youl'' exelaimed Parsons.  Tis a pity,
sir, and often's the time I have said it, that yon arn't in parliament
yourself-youd pretty soon show 'em what their meddling with fac-
tories would do for the country,''
T likely I might, Parsons; but a man can't be in two places
at onee-and depend upon it, there's good to be done here, if we
knew how to set about it. I shall make you stare, perhaps, Mr.
Parsons, when I tell you what I am about now. It came into my
head by aceident at lirst: but if 1 don't greatly mistake, I'll make
a capital thing of it before lI have done.''
 There's no doubt of that. Sir MIatthew, if you sets your mind
to it, let it be what it will,'' replied the confidential overlooker;
' nnd if it isn't a secret, sir, I should like uncommon much to hear
.
 No, it's no secret, Parsons-any thing in the world but that,''
eplie Sir Matthew, laugbing.  What should you say now, Mr.
Superintendent, to my taking a dirty little dog of a piceer out of
the factory into my own house, and dressing him, and feeding him,
and lodging him, all for the love of pure benevolence, anl little
boys 2''
1don't quite understand you, sir,'' replied Mr, Josepl Parsons,
looking very grare.
 N6, I dare sny you don't. But I think I do, Parsons, and
that's more to the purpose. Trust me, tnan, it will do gool if it'
only by giving the people something to talk of just now, besides
this confounded girl's death. And now, my good tellow, tell me all
you know of a boy called Michael Armstrong, for he you must un-
derstand, is the hero of my tale.''
That's the boy, is it7-Then that's why the clan didn't come

to work this moring,'' replied Mr. Parsons;  I knows him well
enough, Sir MIatthew, in course; for he's goiog on for eight or nine,
and he comed to the factory just about five.''
 And what sort of a boy is he, Parsons?''
 Nothing very particular, Sir Matthew, unless it is beceuse of
the unaccountable fuss he makes about his elder brother, who is
but. a poor rickely, shriveldy sort of a child. For some reason or
other, his bones never seemed to come rightly straight, and this
Mike makes as great a fuss about him, as if he was his grand-
mother,''
Are the parents living '' inquired Sir Matthews.
The mother is., She is a bedridden woman, and ought to be
in the workhouse; but she's upish, and can't abide it, and so she
lies abed, doing plain work and that. and the to boys' wages main-
tains 'em. But I did hear tother day, she had given in, and
was a begging to go into the house, and take the eldest boy with her.
These creturs never know what they would be at. I suspect, how-
somerer, that she has got hold of a notion, that because he's so
cripply, he beant to work no more; but I shall take care to see
Butchel, the parish-overseer, about it, It is altogether a trick that,
what won't answer-his fingers is just as able to handle the reels,
and piece the threads as ever they was; and in course, a little dwarf
like him, with his legs like crooked drumsticks, can't look for any
but the youngest wages: so after all, he's one of them as answcrs
best,''
No1 Parsons, nol ejaculated Sir Matthew with sudden energy.
That womnan must not go into the workhouse. The whole thing
shall bo got up, I tell you, in the best possible style. WYhat d'yo

things sold Z-and we just stepping in at the very nicke of time, to

There was something so truly comic in the expression of the
knight's countenance, as he said this, that even the saturnine Mr.
Parsons could not help laughing.
If the born devils don't sing your praises through the country,

Now then be otf, Parsons, and contrive some cleer scheme or

A LITTLE cTTGE GoOssI-A yIsIT OF CIIAITY--PnA1CTICAL
BENEOLNCE.
Tmr promptitude of the measures taken by Mr. Joseph Parsons,
. to bring to effect tha wishes of his master, showed him to be de-
serving the post of confidence he held, as principal superintendent
of Sir Miatthew Dowling's factory. He lost not a moment in ob-
taining a short interview with one of the parish-officcrs, who was his
particular friend, and then made his way to Hoxley-lane, with the
intention of questioning the widowed mother of the two Arm-
strongs, as to the situatian of her affairs, and the particular species
of misery from which she might, at that prccise moment, be suffer-
ing the most.
The statement pronounced in Sir Matthew's kitchen respecting
the general eligibility of Ioxley-lane as a place of residence, was
perfectly correct. It was the most deplorable hole in the parish-a
narrow, deep-rutted parish-road (too hopelessly bad to be indicted),
led from the turnpike down a steep hill to the town of Ashleigh.
Exactly at the bottom of the hill, just at the point where every
summcr storm and winter torrent deposited their gatlerings, there
to remain and he absorbed as they might, began a long, closely-
packed ouble row of miserable dwellings, crowded to excess by
the population drawn together by the neighbouring factories. There
was a squalid, untrimmed look about them all, that spoke fully as
much of want of care, as of want of cash in the unthrifty tribe
who dwelt there. It was like the moral deliuquencies of a corporate
body, of hich no man is ashamed, because no man can be pointed
at as the guilty ot. It was not the business of No. 1 to look
after the filth accumulated in front of No. 2; and the inhabitants
of No. 3, saw no use in mending the gate that swung on one hinge,
ecause No. 4 had no gate at all: and the dogs and the pigs wha
made good their entry there, of course found their way esy
enough through the make-helieve hedge, which throughout the
row divided one tenement from another. The very vilest rags were
hanging before most of the doors, as demonstration that washing of
garments was occasionally resorted to within. Crawling infants,
half-starved cats, mangy curs, and fowls that looked as if each
particular feathecrhad been used as a scaenger's broom, shared the
dust and the sunshine between them, while an odour, which seemed
compounded of a multitude of villanous smells, all reeking toge-
ther into one., floated over them, driving the pure untainted air of
heaven aloft, far beyond the reach of any human lungs abiding in
Hoxlcy-lane.
Where does widow Armstrong live 2'' demanded Mr. Parsons
of a woman who was whipping a child for tumbling in the dung-
Ill before No. 5.

TRE LIFE AXND ADYETURES5
In the back kitchen of No. 12, please your honour,'' replicd
the woman, making a low reverence to the ell-known superin-
tendent.
No. 12-why thats Sykes's tenement-and they're on the
ground-floor themselves.''
e Yes, please your honour; but since the rents have been raised
y Sir Mlatlhew, the Sykes's have becn obliged to let off the baek-
kitchen, ant live in the front one.''
e WVh there's a matter of a dozen of 'em, isn't there ?''
 Yes, y our honour, they lies terrible close,''
:Obstinate dolt-heads:-That's just because they pretend to
fancy that it is not good for the smiall children to work-I know,
for certain, that they hnave got two above five years, that they won't
send to the factory; and then they have the outdaciousness to con-
plain that the rents are raised-as if ecause they are above choosing
to earn money in an honest way, Sir Matthew was not tn make what
he could of hisown. 'Tis disgusting to see such airs, where people
ought to be thankful and happy to get work,''
That's quite true, no doubt, sir,'' answered the woman, con-
tinuing to shake, and occasionally to slap the grub of a chiid she
had taken off' the dunghill.  But obert Sykes's children are
very weakly: and them as your honour talks of, is almost too small
--though 'tisn't to be doubted that it is the bounden duty of us all
to send 'em, sooner than see 'em starve,''
.I fhancy so, indeed,'' replied Mr. Parsons; adding, with a finger
pointed at the squalling child, who still continued under the cleans-
ing process above descrihed, ``And isn't it a comfort now, Mrs.
Miller, to get rid of the plague of 'em7''
The woman ceased to shake her little boy, and looking for a mo-
ment at the clear blue eyes that, notwithstanding her rough disci-
pline, were very lovingly tumned up to her face-something like a
shudder passed over her.
Get along in with you, Bill,'' said she, as if afraid that the
blighting glance of the superintendent should rest upon bhim; and
then added, `` as long as they he so very small, your honour, they
can't do no good if they be sent.''
 Stuff and nonsense? there's ways to teach'em. But don't
fancy that I want you to send your brats-confound'emn: They're
the greatest plagues in natur: and nothing on God's earth but
good-heartedness and love of his country would ever make Sir
Matthew, for one, trouble himself or his men with any of the creturs.
--No. 12, is it, where 1 shall find the widow Armstrong 3''
Yes, please your honour-you'll be sure to find her. She's a
cripple pour soul, and can't stir,''
She's made up her mind to go into the workhouse, bhasn't she ''
demanded the manager.
Have she indeed, poor thing ?'' responded the woman, in an
accent of compassion.
I heard so, as I come along, and that's the reason I'm going to
her. Our gooi Sir Matthew, who to be sure is the kindest-hearted
o IICnEL ARSTRONG.

man in the whole world, has taken a fancy to her boy, and he'll be
 father to him, Il e bound to say ho wvill; and thats why 1 thiuk
hed like me to give her a call, just to tcll her not to fret herself
bout the workhouse. If she don`'t like goiog thee, she neeln't, I
dare say, with such a good friend as she's got.''
TThe woman starcd at him with an air of such genuine astonishi-
ment, that the superintendent felt disconcerted, antd turning abruptly
away, continued his progress down the lanc.
By the time he had reached No. 12, however, he had begun to
doubt whether his suddon appearance at thc bedside of the widow
Armstrong might not produce an effect unfavonrable to the object
he had in view.
`As sure as steam's steam,'' thought he, t she'll be more
inclined to fancy that l1 am come scolding ahout tho boys for some-
thing, than to take her part, or do her pleasure; so l'll just say a civil
word to the Sykeses, and thcn stroll away on, till such time as the
parish officers have beon after hoer. Ill engage for it, that Sam
Butchel won't let no grss grow under his teet after what I said to
him; and if I turn in when he's thore, as if t see what was goilg
on, it would certinly be more natural-like, and believable.''
In accordance with this improed projetf de charil, MIr. Joseph
Parsons walkcd on; but he had not procecded far ere, on turning
his head round to reconnoitre, he perccivcd, not the tall and burly
fSam Butchel, the overseer of the parish, but the lean and lathy
person of little Michael, adsancing with an eager and rapid ste
towards his mother's dwelling-
Soht' ejaculated the sagacious Parsons, `` herc comes the
charity jobI It would be worth a week s wages to hear him tell his
own story.''
Mr. Joseph Parsons had a Napoleon-like promptitude of action,
which the unlcarned operatics described by calling him `` a word-
and-a-blow man,'' bnt which in reality often doserved the higher
epithet abuve bestowed.
Scarccly had the thought of oerhcaring littlec Michael's talc sug-
gested itself, ere a sidelong movement ensconced him for a moment
behind a favouring ig-sty, from whence, unseen, he watcho the
boy enter the door of No. 12.
Again Napoleon-likc, he remembered all he had heard from her
neighbour, concerning tbe position of the widow's dwelling-plaee:
and rightly judging that Sykess back-kitchen mst., in some way
or other, be in a condition to favonr the emission of sound, he
troubled not the household by making his approaches through the
principul entrance, but striding over the ineflicient fence of the tiny
cabbage-plot behind, obtained a station as favourable to his pur-
posc, as he could possibly desire. `1his was a nook bctween a pro-
tuberance intended for an oven, and the window close beside tha
widow Armstrong's bed, from'whence prophetic fate, favouring the
yet latent purpose of the manager, had caused three panes to be ex-
tracted by a volley of pebbles, intended for mother ykses's cat, at
least two months before.
38
THE LIFE AD ADVENTURES
To this safe and commodious crouching-place, he made his way
just in time to hear the widow say, `' Understand one word of
Edward's story, Mlike; so sit down dear hoy, and tell me all.''
Why mother, 'tis like a story-book-and it's very fine to be sure
-but yet--'' And the boy stopped short.
ut yet you don't like it, Mike?'' rejoined his mother.
 That's what you, was going to say. Tell the truth, my child,
aud don't go to eep nothing from me.''
That was it,'' said Mike.
Ungrateful viper?'' muttered the confidential superintendent
hetween his closed teeth.
Poor fellow: poor dear Michael1'' oxclaimed the woman,
soothingly.  It was hard to go to sleep without kissing mother,
wasn't i?
Yes, I didn't like that-nor I didn't like being without Teddy
neither-and I din't like the grumpy old lady as comed into the
kitchen, and abused me: nor the gentlemen servants either, cxcept
the gardener, and he took hold of my hand, and led me along kind
enough-and I like Molly too, that's she as give me my supper and
my bed, and my breakfast this morning, mother. Oh, motherl
how I did long to bring away some of the milk and bread and
butter home with me1''
 Neer think of such a thing, for your life, boy 1'' exclaimed the
mother eagerly.  Itould be thieving, nothing else, Michael-
nothing more nor less tban thieving-never mention that again to
me, dear, that's a darling.''
I won't, mother; but I know I shll think of it every time I see
them big pounds of butter, and jugs of milk, and minds how care-
ful yon be over yonr little scrimped bit in the broken saucer, and
how you drinks your drop of tea without ever having any milk at
all
 Never yonu mind that, darling. But what are they goiug to da
with you, Mike? And what for do they want to have yon up at
the great house Tis a mystery to me, and thankful as we ought
to be for any help, I can't say but I should be easier in my mind,
if I understood something about it.''
Impcrtineut hag'' growled the surly Parsons from his lair.
Does she think they are going to trap him like a rabbit, for the
sake of his skin 2'
But, mother, I don't understand any thing about it myself,'
sail Mlichael, rather dolefully.
To this avowal, no reply was made for some minutes; upon
which the superintendent grew impatient, and stretching forward
his ncck a littlo, contrived athwart the sheltering branches of an
eldecr-bush, to peep through the broken window.
To the agent or sir Maithew Dowling's benevolence the sight that
presented itself was really rerolting: though there may be others
ho would have been affected diferently by it. Michael had flung
himself aeross the bcd; his arms were thrown round his mother, who
was sitting upright with some piecc of needlework in her hands,
or IICIIAEL ARITROG.

and his dark curls set off in strong contrast the extreme paleness of
the face that looked down upon him. The widow Armstrong was
still rather a young woman, and would still have been a very lovely
one, had not sickness and poor living sharpened the delicate fea-
tures, and destroyed the oval outline that nature had made perfect.
Yet she had quite enowgh of beauty left to detain the eye: and
such a history of patient suffering might be read in every line of her
speaking countenance, that few ever looked upon her harshly.
Spite of her extreme poverty too, she was clean-her cap was clean,
thc bedclothes were clean, and the pale hands too, looked so very
white, that if Mr. Parsons from his hiding-plaee had ventured to
speak any opinion concerning her, he would certainlyhave given utter-
ance to a strong expression of indignation, at the abominable air of
delicacy which her appearance displayed.
She looked as if she were struggling with some painful feeling,
but did not weep, though her boy did, heartily.
For an little while she suffered his tears to low without interrup-
tion or reproof, and then she kissed him once, twice, thrice.
There now, MIichael,'' she said, looking at him fondly; ` have
you not played baby long enought Stand up, darling, and listen
to me. Ykou don't seem over-glad, MIike, of this great change, and
if you did, perhaps I might have been over-sorry;  but soriow
would be sin for either of us, when God has sent us help. `Tis you
that be the heartiest Mike, and 'tis you that want food the most.
growing at the rate you do, and heart-sore have I been at meal-
times to see you so stinted. So never let us trouble ourselves
any more about the reasons for your getting so into favour, but
just thank God, and be contented.''
 But mother1 Ho will you get on without me ?'' replied
lichael, shaking his head; I am sure that Teldy can't make
your bed as I do-he hasn't the strength in his arms. And who's
to fetch water2 'Deed and 'deed mother, you'd better thank Sir
MIatthew, and say no, unless he'll just please to let Teddy go
instead.''
That won't do my dear child, in any way. 'Tle I must watch
poor Elwvard. Little as I can do for him, I don't think he'd like ta
part from me, as long as God is pleased to let me stay.''
 That's true mother-that's very truel Tedly would break his
heart. No, no, 'tisn't he shall be parted from you; Ill show him
how to make the bed, if I can't come oer myself; but perhaps
theyll let me, mother2''
i hat's the business that you'll have to do, Miechael ?'' inquired
the widow.
I haven't been told of any business yet,'' replied the boy.
 But you don't expect that you're going to be kept for nothing,
dear ' said the mothier, smiling.
`Tin't for my work, mother ; 'tis for the cow,'' replied Michael,
gravrely.
 The cow, child ? WVhIat is it you and Tedy have got into yor
hcads about a cow? A poor starved beast, he says it was, that
40
TIL LIFE AND ADVETES
wouldn't have frightened a mouse, and you made it turn round,
MIike-that's all I can make out. But he must be mistaken
surely. Wha wes it you did about the cow, darling?''
At this question, the boy burst into a hearty fit of laughter,
which to say truth. offended the listening ears of MIr. Joseph Par-
sons, still more than his weeping had done.
1Il do his bsiness for him, he may deped upon it,'' thought
he. `` If master must have a charity job, he must; but it don't tol-
low that the cretur shan't be made to know himself just as wcll as if
he was in the factory. I'll be your averlooker yet, master ike,''
Just as this prophetic sketching of the fnture had made itsclf
distinctly isible to his mind's eye, the bodily senses of the agent
announced to him that the tranquil tete-a-tete within the widow's
chamber was disturbcd y the entrance of persons, whose voice and
step announced that they were men. MIr. Parsons was at no loss
to guess their errand.  Here they come:'' muttered he. ` Now
we'll see how Mlaster Butchcl manages his job.
:We be commed to see,'' said a gruff voice within thc widow's
chamler, `` whether or no you be commed to your senses, WMIrs.
Armstrong.''
 Sir2'' said the trembling woman in return.
 You knows well enough what l means, without my going into
it again: you knows well enugh as I comes to talk to ye about
the houseagain. Weve had Larkins the baker, coming to inquire
if there's parish pay to look to, for your bill, MIrs. Armstrong-and
I have told lim, xe,not a farting, not the quarter of a fartling.
unless you'll come into the house. The parish have gone on allow-
ing you two shilling a wveek, week after week, Gol knows how long
--'tis a perfect shame and imposition, and the board says they won't
do it no longer. Yon and the boys too may come in if you will.
that's one thing: but living here, cramming 'cm with as much
wheaten bread as they'll et without paying for it, is another, and
it's what no honest parish don't tolerate. I'll be bound to say now,
as you have brought up the scamps without their ever knowing the
taste of gruel? Tell the truth, did you ever take the trouble to
mnake a drop of gruel for 'cm''
`` As long as I had my legs to stand upon, sir, I never minded
trouble; and, when my husband was living, we did a deal bctter,
and 1 have dne cooking for 'em then, such as a fcw potatocs and a
cabbage, may be, with a scrap of bacon on a Sunday: but, from
the hour he died, we havc never had a pot upon thc fire.''
 That's what 'tis to be so obstinate. If you'd come into the
house you'd sce the pot upon the fire all day long, amost.''
:lBut the children would be in one room, after they came from
the factory, and I shonld be in another,'' pleaded the widow, `` and
l'vc got a fcw of the decent things as I married with, when I came
from service, and it would be a grief to me to seo 'em all sold,''
I the parish lon't sell 'em, ILarkins the baker will, you may
take my word for that, Mrs. Armstrong,'' replied the overseer.

honourable, but that's just as you please. I onlycalled, as in duty
bound, to tell ye that the parish don't mean to contiy no such ex-
travraganee as paying you two shilling a week, no longer.''
God help me'' answvred the widow getly.  I 'is his ill
that so it should be, it would be a sin for me to complaiu.''
That's vastly fine, beant it?'' said the brutal Butchel, `` and
now lcts hear wvhat you'll le after saying to bMlaster Larkins, for
here he comes, as: sure as eggs be eggs.''.
An nbrupt, and most peremptory demnand,. for three, pounds two
shillings and seven pence, wvas here mnde, by a sour-lookinglittle
man, who entered the small room without ceremony, making a grOp
of intruders raund the widows bed, equally unwonted and unwelcome.
Her over-taxed courage seemed to fail, for it was withi something
like a sob that she repliel to his demand by saying, `I shall hae
twele shillings to take for needlework, when this is done, and you
shall have it every farthing sir, if you'll be so morciful''
 And who's to pay your rent, Missis Armstrong ? if I may e
so bold,'' said MIr. Buchel.
The - widow hal not a word to say for herself, and, covering her
face with her hands, wept bitterly..
Now's my time l'' said Parsons to himself, as he stealthily crept
from his hiding-place.  Now for Sir Matthew's beneolence.'' And,
in a minute afterwards, his tall, gaunt figure, and hard counte-
ance, were added to the company. The naise he made in entering,
caused the wvidow to uncover her eyes, ahn it was with an emotioni
little short of terror that she recoguised the tyrant, at whose name
her childrens cheeks grew pale.  Instinctively she stretched out
her hand, nnd took hold of that of, Michael, who was still seated
on the sile of the be. But the boy shaok it off, as if his mother's
loye was a secret treasure that, the overlooker must not see, and,
suddeily standing up, he remained, with his eyes fixed on the
ground,and his huanls haging by his sides, as if petrified.
 Ilollo l-why what's the matter uow? Is all the parish.come,to
wish joy to this good woman .here?'' sail the overlooker, with as
jocund an air as he could persuade his iron features.to assume.
 WVish her joy ?' respandel the well-tutored parish-officer, ` and
for wsht, Mr. Parsons, if you please? For having an honest
tradesman come upon her with the gripe of thie law, in hopes to get
what's his own? She's got into trouble, I promise you, and I don't
very well see how she's to get out of it.''
 You don't sy so:'' said the confidential agent. What. is7'.
that yon, Mlr. Larkins, coming to take the law of a poor body this
way I didn't tbink you was so harl-hearted.''
I lon't deserve that character, sir,'' replied the baker sharply:
for though desircl to call and enforce his claim by the parish
overseer, Ir. Larkins knew not a word about Sir MIatthew's scheme
of benevolence; ` and the proof' that my heart isn't harder than
other people's'' he continued, ' is, that lI gave the widow here
42
TRE LIE AND ADVENTURES
credit for what has been, excepting a few ounces of tea, her whole
and sole living for months past.''
And vesry kind of ye too,'' observcd the conciliating superin-
tendent.
I should like to know, then, what became of all the money
the two boys got, besides her own needlework, and, of late, two
shilling a week from the parish, besid?'' observed Mr. Bulchel.
 WVhy, that is rather puzzling. I must say,'' replied Mr. Parsons,
" but no matter for that, no matter for that, just now. Thie family
have got a kind friend, I promise you.''
Yes, but it does matter,'' returned Larkins.  It can't be right,
no how, for me to be out of three poeunds two shillings and seven
pence, and she with seh lots of money.''
 Indeed, indeed, sir'' said the widow, once more looking up at
im, I hae done my very best, paying a little and a little atas
time, as you know I ncver stopped doing, only for two weeks that
my bigest-that is my oldest boy, was making up time that was
lost, when he was home sick, and so got no wages. But the seven
shillings a week that they get between 'em, and my uncertain bit of
needle-wosk, gentlemen, can't stand for food, and clothes, and
rent'-and a little soap to keep us decent, and a bit of firing to
boil a dron of water-it can't do all that, gentlemen, without
getting behindhand, when any making up time comcs in the
factory.'
s Vall then, that's just the reason why you must comc into the
house,'' replied Butchel; ``and, at any rate, you may depend upon
getting no more money out of it,'
Upon hearing these words, ``the decent, respectable man,'' wha
was willing to take the widow's goods, at a  valiation fair and
honourable,'' began examining the condition of a chair that stood
near him; an operation which the widow eyed with the most piteous
look imaginable.
: Come into the house, I tell you, without more ado,'' resumed
Butchel. ``And what, in God's name, d'ye think we want yon in for
but your own good? D'ye think the parish have a faney for main-
taining crippled women and children, by way of a plcasure? 'Ts
ruination any way; but when youlre in, we know the worst of it at
once, and that's something. The boys' wages will go a bit to help,
and at any rate there'll be no two siillings to pay, which is what
the overseer hates above all things; and what tbey won't continy to
do. So now l have said my say.''
And here MIr. Butchel began to move his heavy person towards
the door.
Stop a minute, MIr. Butchel, if you please sir,'' ejaculatet Sir
Matthew's superintcndent. ` I should be sorry to let you go back
te your employers under any delusion or mistake whatever, and the
fact is, that this good woman, the widow Armstrong, is no morc
likely to go intothe workhouse than you arce yourself, Mlr. lutchel;
begging your pardon for naming such a thing.''

43
Then I suppose as it's yourself as means to keep hcr out of it,
Mr. Parsonst'' repliel the parisl officer jocosely.
 Not exactly me, myself,'' replied the other iu thc same tone,
but it's one as much more able as he is willing. It is Sir Mlatthew
Dowling as intends to befriend her, and that not only on account of
the general charitableness of his temper, which all who know him
really well are quite aware is very great, but because that little boy
as stands there, and who is one of our faetory children, saved a
friend of ady Dowling's, lest night, from something she lookcd
pon to be a considerable danger.''
`And does Sir Matthew mean to see me paid ?'' demanded the
baker.
Upon my word, Mr. Larkin, that's more than what I'e got
authority to say,'' replied Parsons; `` but, howsomever, I don't
think that you had best go on, just at this particular minute, to
esecute about it, seeing that in course Sir Matthew won't take it
civil, when he's being such a friend himself, to the widow.''
I don't want to do nothing uncivi to nobody,'' replied th
baker, `` but I don't quite understand this busincss. It is some-
thing new, isn't it, Sir Matthew setting up for a soft-hearted gentle-
man, among the factory folks?'
Nocw to you, may be, Mr. Larkin, but not to me,'' replied the
trustworthy agent. : There isn't another to be found, look which
way you will, that can be compared with Sir Mathew Dowling, for
real, true, benevolent, charitableness, when he fiuds proper objccts
for it.''
The baker stared; the man of old chairs and tables scratched
his puzzlcd heal; the intelligent Mr. Butchel lookel at the spcaker
wvith a knowing wink; the widow fixed her eyes npon her patchwork
quilt: and little Michael in astonishment, which conquered terror,
raised his eycs to the superintendent's face, while that worthy advo-
cate of a master's virtucs stood firmly, striking his stout cane upon
the ground, with the air of a man ready to do battle with all the
worid in support of what he has asserted.
 Vell then, at any rate my business is done and ended,'' said
Mr. Buchel movring off, `` and I wish you joy Mussiss Armstrong of
your unaccountable gool fortune.''
 Come along, Jim I'' said the baker to the respectable dealer in
seized goods, `` there's nothing to be done to-day, that's clear. Dut
I hopc you'll remember the twelve shillings as you've promised me,
MIrs. Armstrong.''
I ill indeel, sir I' answored the widow cnarnesly; and, on
receiving this assurance, Mr. Larkin took his departre with his
professional friend, leaving Mr. Joseph Parsons, the widow Arm-
strong, and her son Mlichael to cnrry on whatever conversation they
might vish for, without interruption.
WVell now, if I,ain't glad they're gone, them fellows,'' said
the supcrintendent shutting the door afterthem. You are a
faoured woman, Mlrs. Armstrong, to get rid of em as you have
44
TE LIFE AND ADYENTRES
done, and I don't and won't, question that you are thaukful to those
to whom thanks are due,''
 I always wish to be so, sir,'' said the widow.
 WYell, there's no harship in that I suppose. But about this
son of yours, this young MIaster MIichael, you must see to his doing
his duty to his benefactor. If he was to prove ungrateful, 3Irs.
Armstrong, it is but fair to tell you that I wouldn't undertake to
answer for the consequencees.''
God forbid hc ever should be ungrateful to any as was kind to
him I'' replicd the poor woman; `but indeed, sir, I don't think it is
in his heart to be so. Sice the day he was born, God bless him,
Ihae had little besides love to give him, and indeed, sir, I think the
child would die for me.''
MIichael slily stole his little hand sideways under the hed-

eycs were again firmly rivetted upon the ground.
`Ay, ay, that's, all very well; but it has nothing to do in any
way with his duty and obligations to Sir Matthew. What I want
to know is, whether he is ready and willing to do that which Si
MIatthew will require of him--that's the main question, you see,
Mrs. Armstrong.''
And what will that be, sir ?'' said the widow, while Mlichael's
eyes were agnin raiscd for a moment to the face of his taskmaster.
eHe is to be made a gentleman of-that's to be the first work
put upon him.'' The poor woman smiled ; but little Michael shook
his hcad. The superintendent appeared to pay no attention to
either; but again striking his cane magisterially upon the ground,
he added, ` Lct him make up his mind to do all that he's bid, and
come back to Dowling Lodge ith as little delay as possible.''
WVith these words, and without dcigning to bcstow any spccies of
partiug salutation upon those to whom they were addressed, Mr.
Parsons left the room.

WVnE the superintendent, in his serpentine course homcward,
scattered the tidings of his master's mnificence towards the factory-
boy, hiichael Armstrong and his mother indulged themselves in a
few parting words and very tender caresses: the mother continuig
to repeat at intervals, ` Be sure, darling, to be a good boy, and do
what you're bid,'' while the son reiterated his entreaties that she

and Teddy woull take care one of tother, and havc him back
again, spitc of every thing, if thcy found that they could not do so
well without him.
But even hilc this went on, Mlichael was improving lis toilet by
putting on the more carefully patched garments, which had hitherto
been kept saced for sundays. When this operation was completed,
and his hair, face, and hands made as clean as the joint eftorts of
himself and his mother could contrive to make them, the little boy
turned to leave the miserable shed that had been his home, with re-
luctant step and heavy heart, retracing the short distance betwveen his
mother's bcd and the door, once and again to take another kiss, und
to repeat, with increased carnestness, the questions, "` In't there
othing more lI can do for you, mother, bcfore I go away ?-and
will you be sure to tell Teddy to stop for me, mornig and night,
at the gate in the lane, where it all happened ?-yill yon mother ?''
IBut at length the lingering separation was completed, and
Mlichacl sct off upon his return to Dowling Lodge. In the mean
time, Sir Matthew imself had not becn idlc: but, retiring to his
study, he composed a paragraph for the county newspaper, which,
after considerable study and repeated corrections, was at length
conpletcd, and despatched by the post, in a feigned hand, the wax
being stamped with the handle of the seal instead of his arms, and
the postage paid.
The paragraph ran thus:
xGLISII EXEVoLEMCH.
 Thre is, perhaps, no class of men so cruelly misrepresented
as the manufacturers of Great Britain; surrounded on all sides by
a population of labourers, crowded together exactly in proportion
to the quantity of work the neighbouring factories are able to fur-
nish-thcy arc continually reproached both with giving too many
hours of employment to their poor neighbours on the one hand, and
with the poverty which is the inevitahle lot of operatives with large
families on the other.
That all manufacturers, howeer, are not the cruel merccnary
tyrants thcy are so often, and so unjustly described to be, was
shown within the last few days by an incident which occurred near
the town of Ashleigh, not a hundred miles from D-l-g L-d-e.
The owncr of that splendid mansion, while escorting the amiable
Lady -- round his grounds, had occasion to remark some
symptoms of a very noble disposition in one of the children be-
longing to a neighbouring factory on his estate. On making in-
qirics, he discovered him to be the son of a poor widow, whose
failing health made her, and her orphan children peculiarly eligible
as objects of charity. This fact having been satisfactorily ascer-
tained, Sir M--th--w D-l-g gave wsay to the warm impulses of
his generous heart, anl adopting thc liule orphan amang his own
children, at once gratified tlie gentle feclings of his amiable nature,
and sct them an example which it is impossible they should cver
forget. It is more easy for the recorder of this charming anecdote
46
THE LIRE AND ADVETURES
to relate thus the principal circumstances of it, than to cnter into
any detail of the numberless delicate traits of character exhibited
by Sir M. D-l-g in the course of thc transaction. Those who
know him thoroughly, will, howeser, be at no loss how to supply
these: and those who do not, would scarcely understand the de-
scription, were it given with all the detail possible,''
The value and the aecuracy of the statements contained in this
announcement, belonged wholly to the author of it; the phraseo-
logy to a private MlS. digest of nespaper eloquencee, the result of
many years of steady research, during which no morsel of fine writ-
ing tbat might assist in such oecasional addresses to the public as
the present, had been eer suffered to flow down the stream of time,
and perish, without having been first carefully noted in the knight's
repertory of fine periods.
Having concluded this business, Sir MIatthewn Dowling rang his
bell. As it was only thc study-bcll, it was answered, as usual, by
one of the housemaids.
Where is the little boy, my dear, that I sent into the servants'
hall last night ?'' inquircd Sir Mlatthew.
Upon my word, Sir Matthe, I can't tell,'' she replied; adding,
in that tone of familiar confidence which her master's condescension
encouraged, `but if you sent him into the hall, Sir Matthew,
he never got there, nor never will, you may take my word for that,
as long as Madam Thompson rcigns.'
Thc housemaid wasnot a beatty-none such, as was before stated,
ever made part of Lady Dowling's household; but shc was a wit,
and Sir Matthew was too clever himself not to feel the value of
cleverness in others: he, therefore, raised his eyebrows in a comic
grimace, very good-humouredly chuckel the maid under her ugly
chin, and instead of putting himself in a rage, as might have
happened under other circumstances, he only said, ' And how was
that my dear? Come, tellmne all about it-I like your stories,
Peggy, they are always so funny.''
 WVhosc stories wouldn't he funny, Sir MIatthew, if they told of
the airs and graces of Mother Thompson 1'' replied the liely dam-
sel; `' she's for all the world like an old owl, as sits winking his
eyes and trying to look wise.''
 Bmnt che's a prime favourite with my lady, Peggy, and into the
bargain, knows a thing or two about soups and hashes; so we
must be ery respectful, my dear, in talking of her-but as to her
daring to say, that the boy I ordered into the hall was to ba turned
out of it, that's rather more than possible, I think,''
 That's because you don't know Mirs. Thompson, Sir Matthew.
I only wish you had heard and seen 'cm last night, she, and the
t:c:::::

Sir MIatthew; but still wvithout losing his good humour.  How-

ever, all people of fashion, that is, rich peple, Peggy, alvays do
have a confounded impertinent set of serants about 'em. That's
one of the great differences between high people and lo,''
To be sure you must know best, Sir Matthew,'' replied the
saucy grisette, hut with a look and accent somewhat ironical.
don't mean to doubt that in the least, l'm sure; but in the plaees
I'se lised at-Lord Wilmot's, Lord Crampto's, and such lilk, I
never did hear of my lord's commands being treated in that fashion.
They might hase their jokes in the hall, and the housekeeper's
room too, no doubt of it, and impudent cnough if you liko it;
but for downright flat disohedience, I never did hear of such a
thing.''
Sir Matthew on hearing this, became rather white about the lips,
and red ahout the foreheal; but Peggy knew the rising storm was
not at all Iikoly to fall on her, so nothing daunted, she went on.
I don't think I should have taken much uotice about it, Sir
Matthew, if it hadn't been for not liking to see you treated with dis-
respect; for 1m not over and ahove partial to beggar children my-
self; but that sort of natural dislike was nothing in comparison to
my ieelings about you, sir: and if I had been placed in power, in-
stead of having none, your will would have been obeyed, if every
servant in the house had flowed at me for it.''
 You're an cxcellent girl, Peggy,'' replied the kniglt, approach-
ing hor very condescendingly. You know ell enough that you
are a favourite, and I know well enough, my dear, that you deserve
to be so: and I tell you what, Peggy, I'll take care to let those
animals, my servants, know that I am master here, as well as in the
factory--and that my word's law1''
And so it ought to be, Sir Matthew,'' replied the obedient do-
mestic.  I hope I know my duty tao woll to dispute my master's
will in any thing;'' and as she spoke she very meekly yielded her-
self to receive the condescending salute, with which Sir Matthew
was pleasoed to reward her excellent sentiments.
You are an excellent good girl, Peggy1'' he resumed after this
litule interruption ; ``and don't fear but I shall find means to reward
you. But you must give me your help, my dear, to confound the
importinence of these fellow-servants of yours; if I don't make 'em
wait upon that beggar's brat as if he was their lord and master,never
trust me with a kiss more. Where is the little factory vermin,
Peggy7''
I ain't able to answer you, Sir Matthew; all I know is, that
MIrs. Thompson marched us all out of the kitchen where she sat in
judgment on him. last night, and there he was left with the kitchen-.
maid and the fat cook; but what's come of him since, lI am no
ways nble to say.''
On hearing this, Sir Matthew raised his hand towards the bell,
but suddenly recollecting himself, he smiled and said,  No, no,
that won't do, Peggy, will it? Go, my dear, anl ask where the boy
is, and then come back and tell me.''
The damsel, in return, furtively smiled too, in acquiescence and
48
TiIE LIFE AND ADVEKTURES
approval of his discretion; and upon leaving his study for the pur-
pose of prosecuting her inquiries among the servants, she encoun-
tered the object of them, as he entered the back-door, on his return
from visiting his mother's cottage.
 Soh here you are then? Well, you must come along this mi-
nute to Sir Mlatthew,' said she, addressing him somewhat gruffly,
and not too well pleased, perhaps, at this interruption to the confi-
dential conersation with her master, which it had been her purpose
to renew. But to the ears of Michael, the name of Sir Matthew
was sufficient to render all other words indifferent:; and conscious
only, that into his drealed presence he must go if commanded to do
so, he followed the girl with a beating heart, and in a few minutes
stool pale, and almost breathless, before the awful countenance of
the great man.
Sir Matthew gazed at him for a momnent with a sort of sneer,
which, if interpreted skilfully, would have been found to address itseltf
inwardly. Sir Matthew could not choose but sneer at the whim-
sical arrangements of accidents, which had converted him into a
Mr. Allworth. The sneer, however, as far as it concerned himself,
had no mnixture of contempt in it.  IIad another done this tling,'
thought he, ` should I not have called him fool? and is it not
ninety-nine chances to a hundred, that thcreby I should have de-
scribel him truly? May the snme be said of me? No1 B the
living God, it may not: How now, little boy? you have made
yourself smart, I see-vastly fine, indeed! An inch of clean dow-
las, a piece of snan-new green baize for a patch, a pair of bony legs
without stockings, and magnificent shoes-lI did not say a pair,
Peggy-but very magificent shoes; one I suppose won in battle
from a giant, and the other from a dwarf. Fine asa prince: isn't
he, Peggy '
As he thus jeered the little fellow, his eye wandered with malig-
nant jocularity over his person, which was, in truth, the very model of
make-shift poverty; while the child, as if he felt his eye palpably
crawI like a reptile over him, shudderel he knew not why.
Then, changing his tone so suddenly, as to make even the con-
fiding Peggy start, he continued,  You horrid lump of rags stand
back-stand back 1 back 1 back1 behind that high chair-d'ye
hear 2 Stand close and stand still-if he loes not make me as sick
as a dog, Peggy, let me never smell musk more1''
 Ie does smnell horrid bal to e sure, Sir Matthew:'' repliel
the girl. ` Han't I better take him back to Molly the kitchen-
maid, and make her scour him 2''
 No, hang him-that won't take it out of him-I know 'em all.
No, Peggy, let the scouring alone, and just go up stairs to the
nursery-maids, and tell them to send me down a goad hand-
some suit of clathes, complete, of MIaster Duodecimus's-he is the
nearest in size to this scaramouch; and I will dress him, Peggy, at
if he were the son ofa duke. It will be fun, capital fun, and will it
not be generous, Peggy ?''
Generous, Sir Mlatthew? It will be past all belief: WVhat2

Him to be dressed up in the clothes of Master Duodecimus? oh,
my? Sir Mlatuthe, you must sure-ly be joking.''
Im as serious as an undertaker, girl. Get along with you,
nand do what I bid you-the longer you're about it, mind, the
longer I shall have to sit in the same room with the ragamuffin in
his own full dress-so make haste, if you please.''
This was said in a manner to remove all doubts as to the munifi-
cent knights being in earnest; and the active Peggy went and
returned with as little delay as was consistent with the necessity
she felt herself under, of entering into some short explanation with
the nursery ladies; one and all of whom seemed much inclined, on
the first opening of her mission, to treat the whole business as a
hoax. When at length, however, she had succeeded in making it
apparent that Sir Matthew was waiting for the suit of clothes in a
most monstrous outrageous passiou of a hurry, the messenger's arms
were speedily loaded in exact cniormity to the orders .she had
brought, and she returned to the knight's study with all that was
eedful to convert the rude exterior of little Michael into the
nearest resemblance that nature would permic, to the elegant and
accomplished MIaster Duodecimus.
Consilering the loathing and disgust manifestel by Si Matthew
towards the person and the poverty of his protege, it was extraor-
dinary to see the amusement he seemed to derive from dressing him
up. Tough tle alert anl obedient Peggy stood close by to do
his pleasure, it was his own large hands tht thrust the little limbs
of Mtichael into the clothing he chose they should wear, and it was
amidst shouts of laughter from both, that the ludicrous metamor-
phosis was completed.
lBut somehow or other when they had finished their masquerading
work, the resnlt was uot altogether what Sir MIatthew auticipated.
The clothes were very handsome, well-made clothes, and as poor
MIichael, notwithstanding his leanuess, was a very handsome, well-
made boy, the incongruity between them seemed to vanish in th
mnost unaccountable matner, as the operation drew towards a con
clusion.
Peggy, however, was not such a fool as not to understand what
was expected of hor; so when the knight, catching up his son's tas-
selled cap, pressed it down upon the little curly head as a lusty packer
of worthless goods thrusts down the caver that is to cnclose them,
and then pushed the child towards her with an impulse that ncearly
brought him upon his nose, she very judiciously rehewed her noisy
laugltecr, exclaimiug, ` Did any one ever see such a little quiz 1'
uiz, girl'' repled Sir Mlatthew, eyeing hin wvith no very fond
epression.  It would be well for the scamp if that was the worst
you could ssy of him-I know a thing or two eggy, and that
boy will be licky if he gets drowned. I'Il bet a hundred guineas
that with a few lessons, he would forge any writing you could show
him; and beliore he is twenty, hc will have taken as many shapes as
Turpin. That boy was born with a halter round his neck, l want
no gipsy to tell me that.''

TRE LIFE AND AVENTURES5
During the whole of the undressing and redressing operations, the
boy's cheeks had been dyed with blushes, and his eyes so fixedly
nailed to the floor, that neither Sir Matthewn nor his maid had been
able to enjoy their embarrassed expression; but as this dark pro-
phecy fell on him, he looked up, and it was well for him that his
munificent patron at the same instant turned his mocking glances
towarls the servant, as he said,  There-gather up his rags, girl,
and be sure you wash well after it;'' for, had he met that spcaking
5eung eye, he could hardly have misunderstood the scorn that shot
from it. As it was, however, he saw nothing but the patched gar-
ments that were scattered round, and once more sneering as he
looked at them, he added, ` Lead the  little blackguard through
the servants'-hall, and into Mrs. Thompson's parlour-d'ye hear,
Peggy, up te her very nese, and tell her that I have sent him to pay
her a visit, and when she has had enough of the compliment, lead
him round to Mademoiselle's room, and well have a little fun among
the children.''
By no means displeased with an errand which permitted her to
afflront with impunity thc autoerat of all the offices, Peggy gathered
together Michael's discarded wardrobe and then clutching hold of
his hand, led him, on gre mal gre, to the presenee of the imperious
housekeeer.
MIrs. WiIlis, my Lady Dowling's own maidt, and Mr. Jennings,
my Lady Dowling's own man, were enjoying with that important
functionary a slight morning repast of fruit, cakes, and wine, and at
the moment Peggy an her chargeentered, they yere cnjoying some
ery excellent jokes together. Bt, Mr. Jennings no sooner cast
his eyes on the little factory-hoy, than he arose, lookiug rather
abashed at being caught by a drawing-room guest of even nine
years old, with a glass of claret in one hand, and a slice of pine-
apple in the other.
Peggy, to whom the conciliatory smiles of this gay gentleman did
not descend, enjoyed his mystification exceedingly : and relaxing
her rough hold of Michael's wrist, sho led him respectfully towards
the table saying, `` My master has sent this young gentleman ta
ay you a visit, Mrs. Thompn; perhaps he wonld like a little fruit.
There, my dear, that's the housekeeper fSir Matthew told you of, and
if you will please to go and sit down by her, I dare say she will give
you something nice.''
Mr. Jennings immediately placed a chair besile the gracious
Mrs. Thompson, who, after filling and setting before the young
gentlemnan a plate with whatever she supposed would be most
agreeable, said in a half whisper to his conductor,  Who is it,
Peggy? I didn't hear never a carriage.''
Before she could, or at least before she would answer, MIichael,
who had not accepted the chair offered to him, took his cap from
his head, and with considerably more corage than he had yet
shown said, :`I am Michael Armstrong, the factory-boy.''
WV61 WI1'' screamed the housekeeper; `what bold joke
is tbis, Mrs. Peggy Perkins? Do you think you have got a patent
for your place, that you dare play such tricks as this ?''
o IIICIIAIEL ARISTRONG.
51
If I keeps my place, I don't think I shall have to thank you for
it, maam,'' replied the favoured housemaid, with very little civility.
My master ordered me to bring the boy to pay you a visit; those
was his very words, Mrs. Thompson, and as I was bid, so I have
done.''
There's some people as will do every thing and any thing they
are bid,'' observed Mrs. Willls, again drawing out her favourite
smelling-hottle, while with the other hand she extended a wine-glass
to MIr, Jennings, for a little Madeira, which she felt was absolutely
necessary to support her in this very disagreeable emergency-
 Master, or n master, Sir Matthew Dowling doesn't know
how to behave himself-it's I says it, and I don't care who repeats
it to hin.''
Mr. Jennings stared at the factory-oy for a full minute very
attentiely, and then gave a long low whistle, at the same time
turning his eyes with a look of much intelligence full in the face of
the housekeeper.
He isn't at all like any of 'em, Mrs. Thompson,'' said he.
MIrs. Thompson shook her head. e There is nothing at all in that,
Mr. Jcnings, I'm somy to say. DBut remember I do desire, and
insist, that the subject is never alluded to in my peseee again-
When 1 lived with his grace, I always made it a rule that none of
the household should ever discourse in my presence of any thing
that it was not decent to hear.''
 WVell, ma'am,'' said Peggy: `when you have done looking
at him, he is to go into Momsell's room for the children to see
him.''
The housekeeper, the lady's-maid, and the footman, all simulta-
neously lifted up their hands and eyes to heaven.
 Please to let me put ou my old clothes and go home,'' said
Michael.
 Yon little ungrateful wretch :' exclaimed eggy; `' when Sir
Matthew dressed you up himself with his own hands. What d'ye
mean by that, you bad bhoy?'
They'Il laugh at me,'' said Michael, resolutely; `and I don't
like i.'
ou don't Isn't that a gool one?'' said Mr. Jennings, slep-
ping his hands in ecstasy.  Oh, Lord: pray let us have him back
again, Mrs. Peggy, that is to say if Sir Matthes can bear to part
with him. He's the finest fun l've got sight of this many a day.''
 You must find fun for yourself, Mr. Jennings, for I shan't be at
the trouble of bringing you none,'' replied the self-satisfied Peggy.
agin scizing the hand of Michael, and lealing him off
Iell, for a broom-maid, I hope she's saucy cnough,'' said Mr.
Jenuings; but the subject of his remark was already beyond hear-

appropriated to the younger branches of the Dowling iamily.

HvIx given a sharprap on the door, Peggy was told to ``com
een,' by the voice of Mndemoiselle Beaujoie; whereupon she threw
the door wideopen before her, and stool with Michael Armstrong in
her hanl, in thie presence of three grown-up Miss Dowlings, thrce
middle-sized Miss Dowlings, two little MIiss Dowlings, and their
French governess.
The five youngest, all rushed as by one accord towards Michael.
 What a pretty little boy 1' was exclaimed by two or three of
them. `` Are you come to play with us? MIayn't we have a holi-
day, Ma'mselle 2'
 WVhIat an clegant-looking creature I' exclaimel the eldest Miss
Dowling, who with her two grown-eup sisters, had come into the
room for the advantage of practising duets on a venerable pianoforte
totally out of tune, and whose loudest note could by no means
compete with the shrill accents of the animated group who inha-
bited the apartment. Did you ever see a prettier boy, Hiarriet?''
 WIo is he, I wonder ?'' replied the young lady she aldressed.
 How he blushes I'' said the governess, tittering.
WVhat's your name, dear?'' demanded Mliss Martha, the third
daughter of the Dowling race.
.  Michael Armstrong, maam,'' replied the boy, loking un with
an air of snrprise, for MIiss kartha, queer-looking as she was, spoke
kindly. Aid queer-looking as she was, Mlichael met her eye with
pleasure, for that too spoke kindly, though it was neither large non
bright.
Martha Dowling was in truth, about ss ugly as i was possible for
a girl of sevcnteen to be, who was neither deformed nor marked by
thc smallpox,-short, fat, snuhi-nosed, red-faced, with a quantity of
sandy hair, that, if not red, lookted very much as if it intended to
e so: eyes of a light, very light gray, and without any thing
whatever in external appearance to recommend her, except a
mooth, plump, neck and shoulders, with hands and arms to match,
wliich, in truth were very fair and nice-looking, and a set of well-
formed, stout white teeth.
WIt made the unlucky appcarance of this young lady thic
more remarkable, was the contrast it presented to therest of her
family. All the other youg people werc, like both their parents,

one of the whole set (exscept that poor vulgar Martha), who was not
most particular genteel-looking.''
2`Gcnteel looling'' she certaiuly was not, nor graceful, nor
heautiful in any way: und thc consequcnee was, that father, mo-
ther, brothers, and sisters, were all most heartily ashamed of her.
This was a misfortune, and she telt it to be so prctty sharply, for
poor vulgar Martha was far from being a stupid girl. But, in her.
case, as in a million of others, it might be seen that adversity,
though
ILike the tnnl. ugly and venomous,
Wareth a precious jewel in its head.''
for of all her race she was the only one whose heart was not seared
and hardened by the ceaseless operation of opulent self-indul-
gcnce. She felt that she was rather an object of pity than of admi-
ration, of contempt than of envy, of dislike than of love. `This is
severe schooling for a young girl's heart, but if it produce not
reckless indiflerence, or -callous insensibility, it often purifies,
softens, and even elevates the character. Such were its eflects on
MIartha Dowling: tbat coarse-seeming exterior contained the only
spark of refinement of which the Dowling family could boast.
Never did a high-horn Hlidulgo, in Spain's proudcst days. ineulcate
among his race the immeasurable importance of pure descent, with
more ceaseless or more sedulous earnestness, than did Sir Matthew,
the omnipotcnce of wcalth among his. Every child was taught, as
soon as its mind became capabie of receiving the important truth,
that not only was it agreeable to enjoy and cherish all thc good
things which wealth can procurc, but that it was their bounden and
special duty to make it visible before the eyes of all men that they
could, and that they did, have more money spent upon them, than
any other family in the whole country; but Martha felt that all this
could not apply to her.
Strange to say, the only tie resembling affection which prevented
the total isolation of this poor girl among her family, was that
which existed between her hard-natured father and herself; but it
was a sentiment not easy to analyze. In Sir Matthew it pro-
bably arose at first from his hasing heen told that the little girl wvas
very likc him; and, on hers, fromi his being the only person in the
house who had ever bestowed a caress pon her. In both cases,
cause and effect went on increasing. Martha's face (saving its ex-
pression), was incontrovertibly like her father's; and, for that rea-
son, or from the habit it had at first created, her father, though
rather ashamed to confess it, was ccrtainly very fond of her.
That, as a child, she should love him in return, was almost in-
evitable; but that, as she advanced in years, she should feel for the
being, thc most completely formncd by nature to he hateful to her,
an allection the most unchanging and devoted, had someting of
ystery in it less censy to be explaimned. et, so it as. Mlartha
Dowling adored her hard-hearted, vicious, unprincipled, illiterate,
vulgar father, as hcartily as if he had been the model of cvery thing
she most admired and approved. Nay, it may be, that she loved him

to Martha as he uttered it, as if anxious to see how she bore it, but he
encountered a look that altogether puzzled him; for thoughit was
at least as kind as before, there was uneasiness in it, and she looked
round her, as if uucomfortably doubtful of what would happen
next.
he did not, however, wait long for the result: or MIiss Sophia,
MIiss Louisa, and Miss Charlotte, the thee middling-sized Miss
Dowlings, who had approached very near to the liutle boy, and were
even growing so familiar that Mliss Charlotte had taken hold of one
of his dark curls, were severally and suddenly drawn off hy the re-
spective hands of their two eldest sisters, and the goyerness.
Then he is not a young gentleman after all ?'' said Miss
Sophia.
`La; how funny'' exclaimed Miss Louisa, ``where did he get
his clothes from ?'' interrogated Miss Harriet.
``Most likely he stole them,'' responded Mliss Arabella.
Why 'tis Duodecimus's jacket I'' ejaeulated the observing MIiss
Charlotte.
Oh1 quelle horreur 1' cried the governess driving her pupils
all before her to the other end of the room.
At this moment, and before amy more active measures could be re-
sortel to for the safety of the young ladies,the door of the school-room
was again thown open, and the portly person of Sir Matthew
appeared at it, aecompanied by the globe-like figure of Doetor
Crockley.
Good moruing young ladiesl'' said the proud father, looking
round him, and imnediately entering into the jest that he saw was
afloat. How do you like the young beau I have sent you?''
Good gracious, papa l'' exclaimed the elegant and much ad-
mired Miss Arabella, `' he is a beggar-boy and a thief1'
Bir Matthew, and his friend Doctor Crockley, both burst inta
such a shout of laughter at this sally, that it was a minute before
either of them could speak; but at length the knight, turning to the
doctor, said,
Leae my girls alone, Crockley, for finding out what's what; I
don't helieve there's one of them but what would have found that
ello out, if I had wrapped him up in the kings own antle'
They are sharp enough, there is no doubt of that,'' repliel his
friend, ` but I mnust say you don't perform your charitable acts by
hales, Sir Matthew. Yon hae dressed up the little scamp se
superbly, that nothing but the vulgar lark complexsion could make
one know that he was not one of your own,''
 Wh yes, there is some difference in the skins I must say,'' re-
plicd Sir Matthews, looking with most parental complacency on the
fair skins, flaxen hair, and light eyelashlies of his race.
Difference, indeed: ITig Africa and Europe. And is it not re-
markablc Sir Matthew to see the laok of him? Hasnt he get a
sort of slaish, terrified air with it? I tell you what, Sir Matthew,
I should not be at all surprised to find, when the march of philo-
sophy has got a little fartiier, that the blackamoor look comes along

women, and childreri, as a field of clover upon the inferior animals.
And why.not ? It is quite natural-perfectly conformable to the
analogy, that, by accurately tracing cause and effect, may be
followed through all creation. You have a head, Sir Matthew, for
that sort of thing: you can understand me, if nobody else cnn.''
The little doctor knew that this was one of the soft points at
which his wealthy neighbour was assailable. Sir latthew loved to
be assured that his head was of a superior fhabric.
Bt why, papa, should you send a nasty beggar-boy to us, with
Duo's clothes on1'' inquirel the intelligcnt Louisa. Before he
replied to this, the knight exchanged a glance with his friend,
which scemed to say, `` that's the right sort-she's in the clover-
field.''
I have taken him in for charity, my dear,'' replied the knight,
with a sort of pomposity that seemed of a new pattern. The young
ladies had never seen papa look so before. MIartha, from having
found herself rather more frequently the object of Dr. Crockley's
jokes than she desired, had, on his entering the room, retired to the
window, but naw she came up to her father, and quietly, and as
often happened, almost unnoticed, kissed his hand.
For charity ?'' exclaimed the fair-haired Arabella, moving a step
or two farther away from the ohject of this extraordinary caprice.
 Ln Papa: hy don't you send him to tle hospital?'
Doctor Crockley laughed outrageously.  That girl, Sir Mat-
thew,'' he said, when he had recovered his voice, `` that girl is be-
yond all comparison the most tloroughly-born lady that evcr 1
happened to hit upon-and that is saying something, I promise yo.
She hasn't n commonplace vulgar notion in her from top to toe. It
is what I call the physiology of wealth-it is upon my soul-it is a
study, a science. I have not got to the end of it, but I am certain
I shall make a system out of it-and you'll be able to follow me,
there's some comfort in that. I declare to God, that if I had not
found you in the neighbourhood, I should have bolted. I cannot
exist withou occasionally bringiug my mind in contact with superior
intellect; you find that, too, Sir latthew, I'm sure you lo.''
Sir Matthew assured him that he did, very much: and then
pulling a Bclinda lck that adorned the olivse-coloured throat of
Mademoisclle IBeaujoie, he asked her if she had ever seen a brat,
taken in for charity, so nicely dressed as that little blackguard.''
 Brawt? ca veut dire petite vaut-rien. No, my honor Sire
MIatue, nayverl you are viddout no reval de most-''
Whilst the French govrerness struggled to find a word sufficiently
expressive of admiration, and if possible, with some little mcaning
besides, Sir iatthcw took the liberty of pinching her ear, while he
whispered into it,  What, you little rogue? what?'
She gave him a Parisian eillade, by no means an unkind one,
and turned away, while the two smallest Miss Dowlings ran up to
her, and, in the jargon in which their mamma and papa delighted,

lemanded ``si papa voulait let them jouer asec the little beggar-
boy ?'
This question, repeated nearly in the same words by Mademoi-
selle Beaujoie to the knight, appeared to cause him some perplexity,
and, after reflecting upon it for a minute, he turnel to consult his
philosophical friend.
I say Crockley, what do you think of that ?'' Then lowering his
voice, he added, '` you comprehend the job, doctor,--which will do
best to help i? Parlour or kitchen, school-room or factory,
drawing-room or scullery?
` All and every of them,'' replied his friend, in the same lo
tone, but very decisively. e No doubt in nature about that, Sir
Matthew; hc must be here, there, and every where, and the thing
will fly like mad.''
You are always right Croekley, there is nobody like you,'' re-
plied the grateful knight, cordially slapping the round shoulders of
his friend,  I twig, I twig, and so it shall be, by the Lord
Harry.''
Yon are as rapil as lightning, Sir Matthew . I remember no in-
stance of a cerebral formation so absolutely perfect as yours. Now
then, let us visit my lady, shall we? I am as dry as brickdast,
and it is about lunch-time I take it. Bring the boy with you, and
introduce him before the servants in style.''
So1 will-tht's it-I twig, Crockley. Go, Martha, and see if
the luncheon is laid.''
The rcport being favourable to the wishes of the gentleman, the
arty, consisting of the three eldest Mliss Dowlings, their papa and the
doctor, left the young Iadies and their governess to dine, while, withi
little Michael, who was ordered to follow, they all repaired to the
dining-room, where a wcll-covered tablc awaited thcm.
Her ladyship and Mr. Augustus were already there, and both
exprcssed exactly the degree of curiosity which the knight desired,
as to who the little gentleman might be whom they brought with
them.
MIiss Dowling,' and Miss IIarriet Dowling, burst into a loud
laugh; Sir Mathew looked towards the sideboard, and sceing two
servants in attendance there, spoke as follows:
My dcar Lady Dowling, I must bespeak your munificent cha-
rity, and universal benevolence in favour of this little unhappy boy.
His mother is a widow, and-and something, I forget exactly what,
is very unhappy about her-and this little boy behavel rcnarkably
well---'' Here Sir Iutthew broke off in some degree of embarrass-
ment, not wishing particularly to impress upon his laly's mind that
it was his tender care for the Lady Clarissa Shrimpton, which had first
introduccd the fortunate factory-boy to his notice. But he passcd
all that over very skilfully, and ended his harangue by saying. 1
know perfecly well, my dear lady Dowling, that there is not in tha
whole world so amiable a person as yoursclf, and thercfore I entcr-
tain not the slightest douht, that the benevolence which warms my
heart on this occasion, will communicate itself to yours.''
58
TIIE LIPE AMD ADEXTURES
Lady Dowling raised her light eyebrowss, and her still lighter
eyelashes, into a look of the most unmitigaled astonishment, and
remained thus for a while, contemplating the extraordinary spec-
tacle, of one of the handsomest boys she had ever seen, dcessed in
a style of unquestionable fashion, and presented to her as a being
so deplorably miserable, as to have excited the pity of her hus-
band. The first clear and distinct idea that suggested itself was,
the necessity of inquiring respecting this beautiful child's mother,
and of finding out whether she might not happen to be beautiful too;
the next arose from the sudden recognition of her own son's on
clothes, and the complexion of the lady became extremely florid,''
I should like to know where he got those clothes from,'' she
said in accents that by no means poke composure of spirit.
MIy dcarest love,'' replied the most amiable and the most polite
of husbands, `` that is entirely my doing. You have known me
long enough, my sweetest, to be aware that lnever do any thing by
halves-I saw that little fellow ragged and wretched, and I clothed
him 
Well, I must say, I do tbink--'' began her ladyship, when Sir
Matthew, seating himself at the table, thrust a knife and fork ints
the very centre of a pigeon-pie, anl accompanied the act by a
sound, something between a slight cough and a grunt, which, in
language matrimonial, was known to mean,  You had better hold
your tongue and mind your business.'' Whereupon, Lady Dowling
sat down too, hut her fair complexion was rather more rosy than
wvas becoming, and it was in no very sweet voice that she said to
Martha, who ventured to take a chair next her, '` Do get a little
farther, clild, can't you 2--kou know lI hate to be crushed and
crammed up so.''
Here Dr. Crockley, who had already fallen with vehemence upon
a cold ham, stopped for a moment, and laughed vehemently.
MIy dear madam, you are of the slight and elegant order your-
self, and you don't make allowance for poor people who are as fat
and roundabout as Mliss Mlartla and I-we can't squeeze ourselves
into an eggshell, Miss Martha, can we?''
Her slim sisters tittered, and the witty Augustus observed, that
To be sure, Mlartha did look more like a collar of Oxford brawn,
than any thing else in creation.''
Meanwhile, the meal proceeded, and little' Michael continued to
stand half-way between the door and the table, as fixedly as if he
had taken root there.
Marth was, in general, very philosophically inclined to let all
things round her take their course ; but she sat exactly opposite to the
object of her father's benevolence, and there was something in the
expression of his eye, as it rested upon the dainties before him, that
was more than she could bear. `` MIay I give the little boy some-
thing to eat, papa'' said she aldressing her father in a timid
voice,
How shall we manage about that, Crockley 7'' whispered Sir
MIatthew into the ear of the doctor who sat close to him.

the surface of water, spreading far and wide,'' replied his counscllor,
whispering in return, ` Let the boy have to boast of his high
feeding, and it will do more good than if you were to endow him
with lands and houses, and keep him lean.''
``Say yeu so, my wise man1 Faith, then, the matter is easy
enough, Ior I lelieve Dowling Lodge is rather celebrated for its su-
perfluiy af good cheer. We'll have him gasping wsith indigestion
wvithin a week, see if we don't'' Then raising his voice, he an-
sered the petition of Martha, by repeating her words,  May you
give the little boy something to eat ?'' and then added with a laugh,
 By all manner of means, Miss Martha; and,'' taking some half.
demolished fragments off his own plate, ``he may boast of feeding
as well as his master. Iere, Master Factory, cateh'' And so
aying, the benevolent owner or Dowling Lodge skilfully cut the
air with half a pigeon, which, taking exactly the direction he in-
tended, struck Mlichael in the middle of his forehead. Whatever
might be the effect of this liberality of heart and hand out of
doors, Sir MIatthew had every reason to be satisfied with the result
within.
The whole Dowling family, with the exeeption of stupid Martha,
burst into a simultaneus shout of deliglit, while Dr. Crockley
clapped his hands, anl vociferated,  Brvol'' as loud as he could
sCream.
Just at this moment, the great bell at the front door, and it was
a ery great bell, resoundel along passage and halls with prodigious
clamour. This is a sound which produces, in those who hear it,
emotions varying according to their varying temperaments. Ge-
nuinely fine, poco curante people, if they hear it, heed it not.
Fussy folks, of whatever rank or station, prepare their looks and thei
books, themselves and their belongings, to receive the threatened
visitation advantageously; but in a mansion of such professional
display as Dowling Lodge, a ring at the door-bell is an event of
serious importance. In such an establishment, the luxuries, or
even the comnforts of the family, are confessedly of no importanee
at all, when placed in competition with the display of their
grandeur; and pon the present oceasion, the whole tamily has-
tened to leave their unfinished repast, in order to receive the wel-
come spectator of their fine clothes and fine furniture in the draw-
lng-room.
 My Iady Dowling, and her two light-coloured elder daughters,
Sir MIatthew, his eldest son, and his learned friend, succeeded in
reaching their respectie sofas and bergeres half ainute before
the door was thrown open, and Iady Clarissa Slimpton, Miss
DBrotherton, Miss Mogg, and MIr. Osmond Norval were an-
nounced.
Great, of course, and very zealous was the joy expressed by the
Dowsling fmnily at the sighi of heir illustious friend and her cor-
tge. Mliss Brotherton was, indeelof herself, or rather of her purse,
a personage prctty sure of eing well received every where; but
6o
TE LE AD ADVENTURES
even Miss ogg was (in yankee phrase) ell shaken, and Mr.
Osmond Norval gazed at by the young ladies, as an emanation
from the rays that encircle the brow of Anollo; while even the ex-
quisite Augastus vcntured, in compliment to his titled patroness,
to shake him too, though he had never been introduced to him at
Oxford.
But the feelings of sir Matthew, at this prompt reappearance of
his fair and noble friend, were something vastly different from any
thing his family could participate in, nor did Lady Clarissa mistke
them. There was a look that spoke infinitely more than any tongue
could utter, and a meaning in the silent pressure of the hand, con-
firming the idea, vhich had often recurred to her during the night,
that it sould soon be necessary to make Sir Matthew understand
the exactnature and cxtent of the flattering, but perfectly innocent
preference she was conscious of fceling or him.
This frst delightful, but somewhat agitating moment over, Lady
Clarissa hastened to explain the purpose of her visit.
 You guess whyI um come, do you not, Sir Matthew?'' she
said, pointing to Mr. Osmond Noral.t Permit me to present to
you, and your highly-educated family, this young otary of the
muses, who, if my judgment errs not, may fairly claim compcti-
tion with the first poets of theage. Nor should we, of this remote
neighhourhood, he insensible to the honour of being the first to
assist in pluming the yet unfletged wing, which shail one day bea
him aloft into the empyrean regions of eternal fame.''
Nothing could be more touching than the manner in which MIr.
Osmond Norval pressed his hat betwecn his two hands, and bowed
low, low, low, to the noble lady who thus announced him. ir
Miatthew, with a stride which, for the vigorous distance it carried
him, might have been compared to that of the knavo of hearts, ap-
proachel the young man, and strenuously pressing one of his
slender hands in both his own capacious fists, attested the value he
attached to her ladyship's introluction by saying,  Mr. Osnond
Norval !-I will not deny, that I do oceasionally myself offer tri-
bute at the muse's shrine:; and that being in some sort a brother of
the crft, I most unfeignedly rejoice in making the acquaintance of
a gentlemnan so distinguished in it as yourself. DBut that is not the
feeling, sir, which principally leads me to tell you, that from this
time forth, I shall hold you as one of my most esteemed friends-
you understand me. That lady, sir,'' ninting to ILady Clarissa,
` is a person whose lightest word ought to be law in this neighbour-
hood,-and to me, is so. If you publih any vorks, put Sir Matthew
Dowling's name down, sir, for fifty copies; should you find yourself
at any time in want aof a library, ray remember that there is one
of no very small limits at Dowling Lodge; andl your reception, sir,
in my drawing-room, and at my dinner-table, will ever be such as
efits me to bestow on one honoured by the patronage of Laly
Clarissa Shrimpton.''
Before this spcech was quite finished, Lady Dowling bcecoming
rather fidgetty, ventured to mutter something about its being far

bettar to sit down to talk; but Miss Brotherton was greatly too
much amused by what was passing to hear her: and for Miss MIogg
to sit while hcr patroness stool, was quite out of the question: so
that lLady Dowling, and the too eldest Miss Dowvlings, continued
to stand like three finely-dressed flaxen-headed statues, to the end
of it.
Sir Matthew than led the high-born lady to a chair, while Mise
Brotherton perceiving that her conversation wvith the knight was
now reduced to a whisper, and that conseqnently there would be
no more fun in listening to it, conlescended at last to answer a few
of the amiable inquiries after her health, which were addressed to
her by Mr. Augustus and his two sisters. Meanwhile, the young
Norval, with pensive eye intent on nature's beauties, stole his way
to the open window, and there having twice or thrice passed his
lingers through his long loks, which descendedin disordered curls
almost to his shoulders, and once and again buttoned and unbut-
toned the broad shirt-collar which fell back, unrestrained by that
most unintellectual ligature, a cravat, remained partly, it might be,
to let the young ladies look at him, and partly to receive the fra-
grant breeze of summer upon his brow.
lt was now that Dr. Crockley felt he was called upon to do
something that might bring him into notice, and waldling up ta
the yeung poet. he addressed him with an air of incipient friend-
ship, which seemed to say, `And I too am somebody.''
You will find this neighbourhood not very prolific, young gen-
tleman, in such gifts of intellect as a poet requires in order to be
duly appreciated. Nevertheless, I will not deny that there is
amongst us a knot, a little knot, Mr. Norval, whom, upon further
acquaiutance, you may find not altogether uncongenial. For my-
self', I may venture to say, that l am as warmly devoted to every
subject, directly or indirectly, comnected with the divine, ethereal,
immaterial, intellectual part of our composite formation, as it is
possible for a man to be, and it will give me pleasure, sir, to make
your acquaintance.'' As this was spoken with energy, the 'sultry
oseasn made itself felt under the exertion, and Dr. Crockley found
it necessary so far to remember the viler portion of his composite
formation, as to sipe his face and bald head assiduously.
The poet bowed, but not as he had bowed to Lady Clarissa.
MIeanwvhile, Iady Dawling, her light-coloured daughters, and
MIiss hMlogg, sat profoundly silent upon two chairs and one sofa of
the splendid anartment; Miss Brotherton and Mir. Augustus eon-
tinued to talk about notbing, and Sir Matthew and Lady Clarissa
ceased not to mutter, what none but themselves could hear, upon
an ottoman, which stood in front of' a distant window. If eye-
beams could have interrupted a tdte-d-tcdte, theirs would not have
long continued to proceed undisturbed; for the mistress of Dowling
Lodge did certainly cast not a few anxious glances towards the
master of it; but it was not for that reason that he at length got
up and rather hastily left the room.
62
TE LIFE AND ADYETURES
WVile all this was passing in the drawing-room, Martha Dow-
lg anl Michael Armstrong remained alone together in the
dining-room.
The flying pigeon, impelled by the beneficent Sir Matthew, having
hit the foreheal of his highly-favoured proteg at the very moment
that the larum, announcing Lady Clarissa's arrival made itself
heard, the greatly amused company left the room before it was
possible to ascertain what would become of it.
The echill ``caught it ere it came to the ground;'' but having
done so, held it by one leg with an air of very comical indecision,
till Dr. Crockley, who respectfully walked the last out of the room,
shut the door hehind him.
The eyes of the factory-hoy and the ugly girl then met.  Come
to the table, my dear,'' said Martha; `and if you like that bird,
eat it-here is a plate and knife and fork for you: but if you like
any thing else hetter, leae it, and tell me what you will have,''
Michael openel his magnificent black eyes, and looked earncstly
at her. He approached the table, laid down the half-dissected
pigeon, but said not a word.
 You would like something else bctter, would you not ?'' said
Martha, smiling at him.
 I don't know,'' answerel Michael, returning the smile.
e You don't knowl-cannot you tell what you should likge?2''
 No ma'am, if yeuplese; I don't know what any of it is.''
 My dear child, it is all very good, I belieso, only you knaw
some people like one thing, and some another. Little boys gene-
rally like something very sweet. Here is some cake, what do you
say to that 2''
I know what I should like best,'' said Michael,
 Do you2-then you shall have it, if you will tell me what it
s'
Something good for mother,'' said the child, blushing violently;
 but you must send me, and order me to take it to her, or else it
will be stealing it.''
 Very well, I will send something to her; but yon must eat
something yourself first. What shall it bec, Michael ?' This ar-
rangement seemed to put the boyinto a state of perfcct ecstasy:
he clappel his hands, raised one foot, and then the other, with
childish glee, and exclaimel in an accent from which all timidity
had flel, e Oh: dear, ohl dear, how nicei''
e WVhat, the cake 2-or the grapes ?-or what ?''
 Taking it to mother1 Taking it to mother '' cried Michael.
 Then you love mother very much, Michael?'' said Martha,
rawing the child towards her, and kissing his smooth dark fore-
head. Michael nodded his head, and nestled closer to her.
t WVell, then, never mind about the cake at present; but I must
find a little basket, must I not -I will gie you a basket if you
will take care of it and bring it back to me, because perhaps we
may want it again.-There, you may eat that if you are hungry,
o MICAEL AMsTnONG.
63
while I am gone away-I shall be back again in a minute.'' So
saying, she placed some bread and meat before him, and left the
TOOImI.
Michael had by no means lost his appetite by his morning walk
to Hoxley-lane, and being in excellent spirits to boot, he sat down
and began to devour what had been set before him with very zealous
eagerness.
He had not, however, done one-half of what he was capable of
performing, when nnother door, opposite to the one by which
Martha had made her eit, opened, and Sir Matthew Dowling
walled in.
Miehael's knife and active fingers remained suspended midway
between his mouth and the plate; the colour forsook his cheek,
and his eye sunk as if unable to meet that of his munificent
patron.
 WYhat stuffing still, you greedy little raseal? What have you
touched with your nasty factory finges? No the grapes, I lope?''
Michael tried to say ``no,'' but did not succeed in producing
the sound; so contented himself by letting the forefinger of his
left hand drop into his plate to show how he had been engaged.
Don't look so like a faool, you oaf,'' said Sir Matthew, taking
him by the shoulder, and shaking him with some vivacity.L
 You
are to come along with me, do you hear that ? and see a lot of fine
folks, and to look up at them too, do you hear that; and by G-d
if you blubber, or look grumpish, I'll have you strapped ten times
over, worse than you ever saw done at the factory. Come alongl--
and mind what I havse promised, for I'll keep it, and worse, that you
may rely,''
Michael behaved like a little hero. He rememhered the promised
basket, and the voice that had told him he should have it; he re-
memberel Hoxley-lane too, and his mother, and Teddy, and their
morsel of dry bread; so he walked manfully along beside Sir
Natthew, and when they reached the rawing-room door, and his
benefactor stretched forth a hand to take his, he yielded it to him,
with scarcely any perceptible shudder.
Bir Mlatthew walked some steps forward, with the boy in his
hand, into the drawing-reom, and then standing quite still, pointed
to the child, and said, `` Lnady Clarissal behold the factory-hoy I'
Nothing could be more skilful than this form of presentation, for
it told Lady Clarissa every thing, and Lady Dowling nothing.
Lady Clarissa sprng from her seat and ran tawards the child.`` Is
it possible?'' she exclaimed, with every appearance of violent
emotion.  O]HI Sir Matthew ' these last words were audible
only to the knight and the litle boy; but as the latter could make
othing of them, and the former almost any thing hte pleased, it was
evident that the lady was as well skilled in sying more than met
the ear, as the gentleman.
 Indeed, indeed,'' said Iady Clarissa, draving forth another of
the coronetted handkerchiefs, `` indeed, indeed, this is a noble act,

IIere her Iadyship pressed her handkerchief to her cyes, and
remained in the eloquent silence of that position for a momnent,
then raising herself from the softness that, as she hinted to Sir
MIatthew, in a whisper, she felt stealing upon her, she callet to Mr.
Osmond Norval, and said in a tone audible to all present,  Os-
mond Norval1 favourel of Heaven, and the musel Let not this
benutiful subject escape you: ILook at this pretty boy-look at
the delicate air of aristocratic refinement which pervades his person.

and Lady Clarissn laid her noble fingers on the coat-sleove of Sir
Matthew Dowling.
 Ier ladyship does Sir hMatthew Dowling no more than justice
Mr, Noral,'' said Doctor Crockley approaching the group. : This
is an act that ought to be given to fame, and, if Sir Matthew him-
self does not object o it, I woull suggest its being recorded y
your pen, in such a form as may give it general circulation.
The poet pressed his hand upon his heart, anl bowed profoundly,
and then, raising the other hnd to his forehead, he stood for some
time silently meditating on the theme thus oflerel to him. During
this interval, the different groups which surrounded him formed a
most charming picture. The young man himself stood apart, and
unconsciousl, perhaps, became the eentreto which cvery eye-beam
converged. Lady Clarissa and Sir Matthew, side by side, and, at
no great distance from him, awaited his reply; her ladyship with
an affectionate smile on her lip, that spoke at once her confidence
in his power and will to do what she required of him. Sir Mat-
thew's expression of countenance could not be read so plainly;
it was grave, but it might be doubtful whether its gravity proceeded
from displeasure that the answer should be delayed, or solely from
the deep interest the subject possessed for him. Ludy Dowling, with
her hands crossed helore her, sas seated on a sofa exactly in front
of them, with her light eyes rather more widely opcn than usual,
looking straight forward, and her small fentures seeming to indicate
that she was not in the sweetest humour in the world. lDr, Crock-
ley, his hands in his waistcoat-poekets, and his short legs rather
widely extended, in what dancing-masters term the second position,
swayed himself with nice balance to and fro, as if measuring the
interval of suspense by secotndls vibrated by his person. MIiss
Arabella Dowling, and Miss Harriet Dowling sat close together
upon an ottoman, ` like to a double cherr,'' of the Bigarreau
kind, with their four eyes so fixed upon the poet that it seemed as if
they had but one henrt and one soul between them; and on tlis sub-
ject at least, their hearts and souls, if not one, were the same; for
they had both, and at the very same instant, fallen violently in love
with MIr. Osmond Norval.

In a deep arm-chair, in which she had almost buried herself, sat,
or rather lay, little MIiss Brotherton, almost convulsed with laughter,
anl with her pocket-handkerchief by no means elegantly applied to
her mouth (being nearly half of it within it), in the hope of stifling,
at least, the sound of her mirth, while Mr. Augustus leant in an
attitude of very distinguished elegance on the back of her chair.
A liutle behind her appeared Miss Mogg, who was in truth neither
sitting nor standing, but perched very insecurely on the extreme
edge of a concl, which uncamfortable attitade she had chosen from
not feeling quite certain whether she ought to stand like Lndy
Clarissa, or sit like Miss Brotherton. The first she fearel was to
dignifiel and listinguished for her; the last too comfortable, and
she deserved credit for hitting upon a position so far removed from
either: and lastly,.very near the door by wvhich he had entered, and
to which he hal slunk baek he knew not how, stood MIichael.
Tis picturesque state of things having lasted quite long enough,
Osmond Norval raised his eyes from the ground to the face of Lady
Clarissa, and making a sudden step forwards, dropped on one knee
an seized her hand. He attempted to speak, but for some time
his voice appeared perfectly choked by emotion. At last, how-
ever, he recovered the power of articulation and said, `` Such a sub-
jectI-Oh, heavenl-at your bidding tool Best and dearest Lady
Clarissa: Can you doubt that all my power and strength will be
put in requisition for it? But-may lI ask-ls it to be published
y subscription 2'
Without immediately replying to this interesting, and to Mr.
Osmond Norval most important inquiry, Lady Clarissas suddenly
clapped her hands together with a sort of vehement enthusiasmn that
lovked very like delirium. Ben Sir Matthew, though his intimacy
with her had more than once made him the witness to some extraor-
dinary freaks, looked at her with astonishment: Laly Dowling's
cyes were more widely opened than ever; Miss Mogg instinctively
thrust her hand into her bag in search of a smnelling-botle; and
Miss Brotherton took her handkerchief out of her mouth, and
looked grave.
I have got it1 Oh, I hae got itI'' she exclaimedl. e What a
delicious idea I-Let us sit down 1 MIogg, push forward that couch,
child.-Poor girlI She really is almost too fat to move. Gracious
heaven, Sir Matthew : what would become of my etherealized
spirit if it were so enceumbered? But sit down,-sit down all of
you,-NorvalI Place yourself on that tabouret.-Mary Brotherton:
Draw near and listen-And all the rest of you give ear to what I am
goingto say, and answer the questions I shall ask with freedom and
sincerit,''
Thus conjured, every one in the room, except Laly Dowling, wha
stirrel not an inch, drew round the place here Laly Clarissa had
seateld herself, and prepared with considerable curiaosity to hear what
she was going to say.
Is not amusemnent the very sonl of life?'' che began.

THE LIFE AD ADYETURES
No oubt of it, my lady,'' from the lips of Dr. Crockley, was
the most articulate of the many acquiescent answers which fol-
lowed.
'Is not a country neighbourhood fearfully, lamentably difficient
in this?'' pursued the animated inquirer.
 There cannot be two opinions on that point,'' replied Sir Mat-
thew, with authority.
And is it not the duty of neighbours, residing within reach of
each other as we do, to exert every facility with which nature has
endowed them, in order as much as possible to soften to each other
the privations to which their distance from the metropolis obliges
them to submit?''
In reply to this demand, there was a perfect clamour of approba-
tion,  Well then,'' continued Lady Clarissa,  if such be your
feelings, lI am certain of success in the project that has come, like
a spirit of light borne upon silser wings to visit my dull spirit. This
noble act of Sir Matthew's must not pass away like an ordinary
deed that is hardly performed, ere it be forgotten. Nol it shall
live in story-it shall lie in' song-it shall live again in actionl
Noreal, dear gitted friend, did you ever write a drama ?'
Occasionally a scene or two, Lady Clarissa.''
That is enough, dear Osmond. I asknot a hackneyed worn-out
pen. I will relate to him, Sir Matthew, this interesting anecdote
exactly as it occurred-he shall lramatize it-perhaps introduce an
episode, or underplot, to inerease the business of the scene-we
will all act it,'' and here Lady Clarissa gracefully bowved to the
whole party, `` and all the neighbourhood shall be assembled to
enjoy the fete. What say you to this, Sir Miatthew ?''
Upon my word, my lady, I think it is one of the cleverest and
most agreeable ideas that ever entered a lady's head. If you and
Mr. Norval will arrange the drama, Lady Clarissa, I will take care
to have one of the rooms fitted up as a theatre, and depend upon
it we shall be in no want of actors. Upon my word lI never liked
any idea so much in my life.''
 WVII1 it not be pleasant, Mary Brotherton?'' said Lady Clarissa,
in her most caressing tone, to the heiress.
Very pleasant, indeed,'' replied the young lady.  I should
ask no better fun.''
`And what does my Lady Dowling say 3'' resumed ILady Clarissa,
with that stiffness of manner with which her ladyship now and then
refreshed the memory of her plebeian friends, as to the difference
of rank between them.''
' Ohl dear me, I am sure I don't know,'' replied Lady Dowling,
looking frightened.
 WYell1 we must not torment Lady Dowling by forcing her to
act, Sir Matthew. There cannot be a doubt that we shall have
volunteers in abundance. You will act, Mary DBrotherton, will you
not 2

heiress.  People as much at liberty to please themselves as I am,

seldomn refuse to aid and abet a scheme so exceedingly full of
amusement as this seems to be.''
 WY Will set such an example,'' cried Dr. Crockley, rubbing his
hands joyously,  that eery county in England shall hear of us
with envy-lI know what Sir MIatthew can make of a thing if he
takes to it. Leave him alone for giving the go-by to all the world,
Write away, young gentleman, write away: depend upon it you'll
havre a theatre, and actors too, that will do you justice.''
At this interesting moment, just as the fair-haired MIiss Dowlings
began to whisper to each other something about charaeters and
dresses, and Mr. Augustus to whisper to Miss Brotherton his hope
thist he should have to act a great deal with her, thc great bell sent
forth another peal, upon which Lady Clarissa held up her finger in
token of silence; and before the new visiter entered, all the bright
sallies of the party were as effectually extinguished as if they had
becn supplied by gas, which was suddenly turned off.

Trt person who produced this very poworful effect was a lady
not pnrticularly distinguished either by wcalth or station; but she
seemed to possess the faculty of finding her way into every houso
within her reach, whether the owner of it desired her presence or
not,
MIrs, Gabberly was thewidow of a clergyman, who had formerly been
vicar of the parish of St. Mary's, Ashleigh, and having madc herself
the very largest acquaintance that evrer was enjoyed by any country
lady without a carriage, she determined upon continuing amongst
them after her husband died, as it might have taken her, she said,
more years than she was likely to live, before she could expect to
make so many friends nll over again. She therefore, on leaving
the vicarage, contented herself with a very small house, as near the
town as possible, and wcnt on very much as she had done before,
only having one maid-servant instead of two, and contenting herself
with a donkey-chair and a' very little boy to drive it, instead of a
one-horse chaise, and a steady man-scrvant of all work.
Considering the wealth and splendour of the neighbourhood in
which accident had first placel her, and to which choice now held
her hound, it may be looked upon as a matter of wonder that she
should have made any intimacies at all. But, though the vicarage
r 2

THE LIPE AD ADVEFURES
of St, Mary's, Aslileigh, was far enough from being richly endowed,
and the private fortune of the late incumbent not such as to
cnable him to approach to any thing like an equality i his style of
living to even the least wealthy among the manufacturers in the dis-
trict, there is stiil a species of respect for the profession of a
clergyman, which opens to him and his family the houses of many,
greatly their superiors in point of wealths; and it therefore pretty
generally depends on the clergy themselves, whether they are on in-
timate terms with their neighbours, or not.
Now MIr. Gabberly, or more properly speaking, MIrs. Gabberly,
who in strength of will had ever been his far better half, did greatly
desitre to be on intimate terms with her neighbours. Rich or poor,
gentle or simple, old or young, she was determined to be intimate
with them all. And she was intimate with them all, very intimate.
One word more, and Mrs. Gabberly shall be left to speak for her-
self, which she wascertainly able to do, with as little impediment of
any kind, as most people. Mrs. Gabberly was the daughter of a
physician; and from her earliest years had acquired so lecidet a
taste for the theory and practice of medicine, that she could never
wean herself entirely from it, but was thought by maany to let it still
occupy rather too large a share of her conversation and thoughts.
Nevertheless, MIrs. Gabberly was exceedingly popular, for though
her discourse ran much, upon bruises and bowels, rickets and
rheums, spasms and spines, it ran also upon matters more attractive.
If she could not teil what every body for three miles round had for
dinner on the very day on which she was speaking, it was a hundred to
one bt she could tell, within a cutlt or a hash, vhat they had been
all eating for a week before. She knew, with an approach to cor-
rectness that was perfectly astonishing, the amount of every body's
expenditure, and every body's debts; could tell to the fraction of a
new ribbon, how many bonnets each lady consumed per annum;
and was perfectly au fait of the quantity of corn and hay got through
in every body's stables, No firtation ever escaped either her cyes
or her tongue, and the Morning Post was a less faithful record of
fine parties, than the tablets of her comprehensive memory.
The Dowling family was aware of all this; and eaeh in their way
had a peculiar value for her society, for Mrs. Gabberly knew how
to be all things to all men, women, and children; but, at the present
momcnt, it was Sir Matthew who felt the most decided movement
of satisfaction at beholding her sharp black eyes, brisk step, and
eager manner of reconnoitring every individual present, as she en-
tered the room.
Here is my general advertiser,'' thought the knight, as he ex-
tended his huge hand to welcome her.  We will have a theatrical
representation that shall immortalize my charity, and here's the one
that shall act the part of Fame, and trumpet it ronnd the country.''
My goodness1 whata charming party of you is got all togetler
this morning,'' exclaimed Mrs. Gabberly, smiling and bowing, and
nodding, and courtesying, to every body in succession, all the time

that Sir Miatthew continued his cordial hand-shaking.  Now you
must just tell me what you are all about, for if you don't I shall
die, and thore's the truth.''
No, no, Mrs. Gabberly, you shan't die, if we can save your
life,'' replied Sir Matthew, in his most jovial tone.  We are a gas
and happy party, at this moment, I do believe, one and asll,'' and
here the knight thought proper to send a glance after liutle Michael,
who, notwithstanding his tine clothes, was looking pale and sad
enough, in the most distant corner from the principal group to which
he had been able to creep.
The expericnced eye of Sir Matthew readl past suffering and
present terror in his speaking features, and he cursed the trembling
child in his hcart of hearts. But Sir Matthew Dowling might have
removed as many coatings as the grave-digger in Hamlet, ere the
looker-on could have penetrated so far; and it must have been a
quick observer that could have deteced the sort of lurid glare that
for half an instant gleamed in the savage look he cast upon the boy.
It was for no longer space that his joyous gaiety was obscurel, and
he then turned again his admiring glances upon the Lady Clarissa,
and resumed his speech.
eThis is the person, Mrs. Gabberly, who must let you into the
mystcry. You must entreat her ladyship to be pleased to inform
you what it is she is going to make us all do,''
 Well then, I hope her ladyship won't refuse. You won't be so
cruel, will you, my lady ?'
 No, certainly !'' replied Lady Clarissa smiling complacently on
tha knight. If Sir Matthew complies with my prposal, 1 shall
have no objection to its being proclaimel to all the wold.''
And here glances were exchanged between the knight and .the
lady, perfectly intelligible to each other, and which said very dis-
tinctly, Ah1 Lady Clarissal'' on the one part: and,  Ohl Si
MIatthew  on the other.
Speak then, my lady I'' said the gallant manufacturer with a
low bow; '` and whatever you shall say, shall be law.''
Now then, ladlies and gentlemen all of you give ear; for not
Mrs, Gabberly alone, but every one present, should pay attention to
what I am about to say.'' And herc Lady Clarissa turned her eyes
round about her in search of the hero of the scene.  WYhere is
the little boy ?'' said she, in a tone of great theatrical fecling.
Como here, my dear liule fellows :'' said Sir Mathew, agai
turning his glances towards Michael, and now looking amiable and
benignant with all his might. But the child seemed to wither be-
eath this sunshine, even more conspicuously than when hc had
been left in the shade; and it was not till the knight made some
gigantic strides forwards to meet him, that poor Michacl formed the
desperate courage necessary to bring him from his corner to the
spot where his noble benefactress stood. Nay, the last steps were
not made wvithout the hclping hand of sir Matthe, which heavily
laid upon his shoulder pertormed a twofold office; ostensibly ca-

ressing, while, in truth, it forcibly impelled the little trembler for-
ward.
Now then, Mrs. Gabherly,' said Lady Clarissa, `` look at this
interesting liutle fellow . It is he who is the hero of our fcte.''
 Indeedt And pray what may the young gentleman's name
be?'' said Mrs. Gabhberly.
 Is not that delicious ?'' eried Lady Clarissa.  Oh, Sir Mat-
thew1 how lenvy you your feelings Note that, dear Norval. The
touch is exquisitely dramatic, and must on no account be omitted.
This yeung gentleman, Mrs, Gabberly,'' continued Lady Clarissa,
with increasing animation, `` this young gentleman as you most
naturally call him, was a iew short hours ago, a wretched, ragged
beggur-hoyI Sir Matthew Dowling, from motives, that I dare not
wound his generous heart by thus publicly dwelling upon, has
rescued him from poverty and destruction. This deed, so beauntiful
in itself, and so beneficial in its influence as an cxample, is about to
be immortalized as it ought to be, by the pen, the rapid, brilliant,
touching pen of my young friend, Mr. Osmond Norval. He has
undertakcn to dramatize this charming trait of benevolence, and
our excellent Sir Matthew, has consented to fit up a little
theatre for the representation of it, at which all the neighbourhood
are to be present as invited guests.''
 Well (now I If ever I heard any thing so delightful as that 1'
exclaimed Mrs. Gabberly, clapping her hands in eestasy.  Are
the cards sent out, Sir Matthew ''
Not yet, Mrs. Gabberly,'' replied the knight, with his most
friendly siile;: `` but depenl upon it that when they are, you will
not bc forgotten,''
 well now, my dear Lady Dowlingl I am sure you are alwvays
so kini to meI'' cried the delighted Mrs. Gabberly, making her
way towards the sofa, where sat the lady of the mansion in frown-
ing state;  I should not wonder if you were to contrive a bed for
me on this great occasion, it would be justlike yon. And oh l myl
I have got sucha quantity of things I want to tell you, but I can't

her hand upon his head, so asto make him turn his face up towards
her, she said, after looking at him vcry earnestly,
 WVell now, for a beggar-child, he is to be sure the genteelest-
looking little fellow, I ever did see:; but, perhaps that may be owing
to his being so pale and thin, which is certinly a great deal more
elegant than fatness and red cheeks, though it don't quite secm so
healthy.''

Oh he is in perfect health, I do assure you, Mrs. Gabberly, as
you would have said, if you had seen the dear little fellow eating his
luncheon with us just now,'' said the amiable Sir Matthew chucking
him under the ehin.  But, by the way,'' continued the merry
knight,  I rather suspect that 1 callel him away before he had
uite finished, and that's what it is makes him look so doleful,
isn't it, dear? Welll never be ashamed abont it-go back again,
there's a darlingl and don't forget to take a nice bit home to
mother and brother-d'ye hear, Michael? Pretty fellowI how he
blushes.''
And here the benevolent Sir Matthew himself opened the door
leading to the dining-reem, and playfully pushed he  darling''
through it.
 Well ow 1'' again exclaimed the astonished Mrs. Gahberly
did ever any body see such a beautiful spectacle of charity as
that2''
And without waiting for any reply, the brisk little lady made het
exit without further pause or delay of any kind, and so completely
charged ``to the top of her bent'' with wonderful intelligenee. that
she actually sufferel from the repletion till half a doen gossippinge
had relieved it.
Meanwhile, the party she left resolved themselves into a commit-
tee of mnnagement upon the business in band. Mr. Osmnond
Norval was entreated to urge his eloquent pen with the greatest pos-
sible rapidity; while on his part, Sir Matthew promised that the
necessary workmen should immediately-he employed in preparing
one of the largest rooms in the house as a theatre.
When the consultation reachel this point, Lady Dowling sud-
denly rose and left the room; but this circumstance did not appear
to produce much emotion in any of the party, and they remained
together in a most delightful state of hubbub and excitement till
the heiress grew tired, and ventured to hint that she thought it
would be hest for her to drive home first, and then send her carriage
back for the accommodation of her noble friend.
This proposal brought the meeting to a conclusion; but not till
Lady Clarissa had confessed in a whisper to Sir Matthew, that she
nevoer in her whole life remembered to have taken any thing that
did her so much good, as the delicious grapes he had sent home
with her the evening before.

WiILzE these things were going on in my Lady Dowling's morn-
ing drawing-room, the forgotten Mlartha-forgotten at least by all
but little Mlichael-employed herself in seeking such a basket, as
might answer the purpose of a viaticum between the object of her
father's charity, and the mother and brother of whom he had so
fondly spoken. Having at length succeeled in her quest, she re-
turned to the dining-room, and was almost as much disappointed
at finding the object of her good-natured exertions flown, as the
poor child himself had been, when obliged to quit the room to
which this kind friend had promised to return. But Martha,
though not a person very highly favoured by cireumstances, was
nevertheless better offthan Michael, inasmuch as by keeping out of
sight she could pretty generally contrive to remain where she
chose, ant do what she likel. These enviable privileges enablel
her now to sit down at one of the large open windows of the dining-
room, anl to draw from her unseemly-sized pocket, a volume of
hakspeare, with which she determined to begile the time till the
boy should return, or till by some means or other, she might be able
to discover what had become of him.
When therefore, impelled by the playfal, but very effectual im-
pulse of Sir MIatthew's shove, Michael once more entered the
dining-parlour, he had the satisfaction of being again greeted by
the friendly eye and friendly voice, which had already so greatly
cheered him.
`So, here you are again, my little man,'' said MIartha, repocket-
ing her book, and rising: ``I thought ye would hardly forget
the basket: see, here it is, and now you shall help me pack it,''
The help thus asked for, was afforded by the happy childs hold-
ihg the basket in his hand, as he followed her round the table,
while with a smile that spoke as much plceasure as his own, she se-
lected all sorts of good things to put into it.
 There1 now I lon't think we can put in any more, MIichael;
so set off, and carry it to your mother.''
Wth eyes beaming rapture, and little hands that trembled with
lelight, Michael closed the lid of the basket, and proceeded to-
wards the door; but ere hc had fully reached it, he stopped short,
and addressing MIartha, in a tone as fearless and confidential as if
she had been his sister, he said,
 But what d'ye think about Teddy? Mightn't I change into my
old clothes again, and just step into the factory for one minute
Teddy can't almost never eat the dinner as we takes to the factory,
and a bit of this would do him so much good l-Muy I?''

Unon my word, Michael, I am rather pnzled what to say,'' re-
plied his friend; `` as papa has ordered you to have these clothes,
he migh not be pleased at your taking them off again, and it would
be a great pity to make him angry with you when he is so very good
an kind, nouldn' i2'
Michael hung his head, anl said nothing.
`` But why need you change your clothes, my dear boy ?-I dare
say eddy wonld be very proud to see you look so nice.''
Still Michael answered not, but began assiduously picking to
pieces the handle of Martha's delicate basket.
 Don't lo tha, dear,'' said Martha, approaching, and taking
the oflending hand in hens; ` but tell me what you are thinking
about ?''
:I am thinking,'' said Michael, ' that if I walked into the midst
of 'em this way, and up to poor Teddy, in his dirty ragged clothes,
it would look''-and here he stopped without finishing the sentence
 It would look, how ?-as if you were proud, perhaps ?'' said
MIartha.
The child shook his heal.
No, not tha. Teddy would not think that,'' he replied.
WVhat would he tlink, then ?-Tell me all tht is passing in
your little hend, and then I shall be able to adivise you.''
WVhy, he'd think,'' said Michael, and teasrs started as he spoke-
: he'd think that he and I could never he right down hrothers any
more.''
Martha involuntarily kissed the little face that was turmned up to
hens, bt replied, laughingl,
Oh: that's foolish, Michael; do you think that a fine jacket
could separate two little brothers that love each other?-I think 1
conld love you quite as well in a shahby coat,as in a fine one.''
Michael looked at her very earnestly for a minute or two, and
then said, almost in a whisper, '` Is Sir Matthew Dowling, as owns
our factory, your father2''
 Yes, MIichael,'' replied Martha, colouring frm some painful
feeling which the expression of the boy's speaking features had gien
rise to. The child coloured too, but said, with good courage,
Please, ma'am, I should love Teddy just as well, and Tddy
would love me, only the others may-be would mock at him and me
too-and I know Teddy could not bear it.''
 Then they would not be as good children as I think you are.
But tell me, Michael, something about the mill: papa has neverlet
3e see it yet, but I believe it is only because mamma thinks it is a
dirty place. Is it very diny, Michael ?'
 Yes, please ma'am.''
`` And what makes it so, my dear? The cotton that goes into it
looks as white as snow. I never can get any body to tell me any
thing about a mill, but I think it must be very curious-and I want
to know, Michael, what good such very little creatures as you cn
do there; yet 1I have heard papasay, that he pays a vest quantity of
money to quite little children, and that's the reason, he snys, that

Augustus; ``for you make a monstrous bad hand at playing the young
lsdy of fashion.  Upon my lile you grow fatter eey day. Doean'
she, doctor? I wish you would dose her a liutle.''
Tha Miss Maha is a little opaque, I will not deny,'' replied
Dr. Crockley, familiarly coming behind her, and measuring the ex-
panse of her waist with his two hands.
 May I speak to you,papa ?'' repeated the patient Martha, quietly
retreating from the jocoe hands of Dr. Crockley, but apparently quite
insensible to all the other attacks.
`What do you want to say, Martha'' demanded Sir Matthew.
Thus much encouraged, she drew near and whispered to him,
 The little boy that you have taken in, pape, wants to know if he
mey pt on his old clothes again, and go to speak to his brother in
the factory ?''
Do you hear this, doetor?'' exclaimed Sir Matthes; ``the boy
wants to go back to the factory again. Isn't that an answer to all
the trash that people have been trying te get up abut their being
over-worked? Itis jst like 'em-that's the very model of a factory
child-do what you will, you can never content 'em.''
` The chap want's to get back to the factory ?'' said Dr. Crockley,
addressing himself to Martha, with an accent that indicated surprise.
 That's curious enough, any how,''
` No, sir, I do not believe he wants to do any more than speak to
his brother, who is at work there-he wanted to take him something
that was left at luncheon, papa.''
 And to show off his own good living to the factory? Tha's it,

Sir MattheI you seize every thing in a moment. What do you say
to our going along with hin? Mightn't we catch a hint or two, as
to how things were geing on?''
 If 1m quick, Crockley, upon my soul you are not slow,'' re-
plied the knight. "' Youve got your horse here, of course?'' The
doctor nodded assent.  Then I will order mine, and we'll ride down
to the mill together. So get along, Martha, and tell the boy thatI
will take him to the factory with me, but that he is not to change his
clothes,''
Martha felt quite aware that she had not executed her commission
successfully. But there was no help for it, and therefore with the
best grace she could, she toll her little client tle result of it.
The whole aspect of the boy changed as he heard it, and, as if
instinctively, he placed the precious basket, that till now he had
continued to hold'hrmly in his hand, upen a table near him.
 But take our basket, Michael,'' snid the kind-hearted Martha,
in a voice that was intended to cheer him; `` I am sure papa won't
be angry at your doing that, for Itold him about it.''
 No, please ma'am, I'd rathcr not,'' said Michael.
76
HE LIPE AD ADvENTURES
 Well, then, go into the hall, by that door, and wait till Sir
Matthew comes through. Perlaps he will speak to you about it,
an at any rate you had better carry it as far as that.''
The child obeyed her, and taking up again the treasure he no
longer valued, passed out into the hall; bui before Sir Matthes and
his friend entered it, Michael had put the worthless basket out of
sight.
Hardly had he done so, when he heard the coarse laugh of Sir
MIatthes and the respondent titter of the doctor approaching. The
liutle tellow started, and jumped aside, in order to place himself ou
of their way: but the knight, striding to the place where he stood,
seized him by the shoulder wih his hand, while with a vigorous
action of his enormous foot, he sent him forward towards the house-
door,. This fet, which was performed with considerable dexterity,
met its rewarl, in the shout of laughter with which Dr. Crockley
weleomed it.  y Jove, Sir MatthewI'' heexclaimed, as soon as he
had receovered his breath; '` there is nothing like you on the face
of Gol's earth.-It is a confounded monopoly though,let me tllyou.
No man has a right to be the deepest reasoner, the best jester, and
the most finished man of taste of his age. Its monstrous, Dir
knight, and a conspiracy against you would be a very honest plot,''
And as he spoke he held his sides, as if still suffering from the
effects of his excessive merriment.
A servant who followed the facetious pair now opened the door,
and on the broad esplaunade of gravel before it a couple of grooms
were holding the gentlemen's horses. As soon as they were seted
in their saddles, with a mounted attendant behind them, the great
manufacturer turned round his head to seek the object of his charity.
Mliehael stood doubting and trembling on the lowest step of the
portico, while a faint hope fluttered at his heart, that the grand
gentlcmen would rile away and forget him; but it was quickly
chased by the voice of Sir Matthew, who, bringing his horse's head
so close upon the child, as to touch him, while he seemed almost to
shrink into the pillar by which he stood, to escape it, said in avoice,
the jeering tone of which again almost convulsed Dr. Crockley with
laughter,
 Pray, young gentleman, may you happen to know the way to
DBrookford factory 2''
The boy looked out upon the wide-spreading park: and though,
despite the carefully-chosen position of the mansion, many towvering
grim-looking chimney cones were seen to rise amidst their own
Iurid smoke in the distance (for in that direction lay the town of
Ashleigh), he could catch no glimpse of tle hated walls that for
years past had formed his daily prison-house. He, therefore,
answered, but not very audibly,  No, sir, if you please.''
eDpeak up, my hero l'' vocilerated Sir Matthew, advancing pon
him,-'` Yes, or na?''
No;'' replied the boy, distinctly.
4 Then c pleased to have the kindness to do me the favour of
following my horse, and I will have the honour of showing you the
way.''

So saying, Sir Matthew gave a merry look of intelligence to his
friend, and they set off together at a brisk trot.
MIichael, for a piecor,' was a tall chill for his age: an, though
his limbs were wretchedly thin and attenuated, they had sufficieut
elasticity to enable him for some time to keep at no great distancee,
though it was a constantly increasing one, from the two gentlemen;
buat, y degrees, bis breath and strength tiled, and periorce his
speed relaxed into a panting, shufling, walk.
Sir MIatthew, who from time to time turned round a laughing
face to look at him, now reined up his horse antd awaited his ap-
pronch; upon which lichael redoubled his etforts, and in a few
inutes stood beside his bcnefactor.
 Step on, young gentleman; step a little quicker, if you please;
or, perhaps, l may find a way to mend your pace: I am not very
fond of such Iazy company,'' And, suiting his action to his words,
he gave the quivering child several sharp cuts across the shoulders
with his riding-whip.
He trots out in style now, doesn't he, doctor?'' said Sir Mat-
thew gaily, making his well-bitted horse cross and recross the road
in such a manner, that, at each manceuvre, the goaded child fancied
himself alrealy trampled beneath his feet.  Don't you think I
should make a good dancing-master, Crockley 2''
 Capital, by Jove :-Egad, the yotungster has learued some
vastly pretty steps already. By the way, Sir Mattheiv,'' continued
the philosophical physician, ` when one watches that pale-faced
young scamp making such active caprioles for no reason on the
earth, but beeause he hears your pretty gentle jennet snuffing at
his shoulder,-when one watches that, it is impossible not to see that
nothing in God's world but sheer wilful laziness makes those ob-
stiunate little brutes, at the factory, pretend to totter, and stumble,
and faint, and the devil knows what: when all their work is to
walk backwards and forwards as leisurely as if they were parading
for pleasure. Nothing shall ever make me believe but that all the
grunting and grumbling we hear about overworked children, pro-
ceeds from a regular conspiracy among the worst of the parents.
And, upon my soul, if you yield to it, you'll soon have to look afer
the wheels yourself,''
Get on with ye, to the lodge there, you lazy cur,'' said the
knight, addressing his panting potege, ``and wait till we coma
up.'' Then reining up his horse, Sir Matthew drew close tohis
lighlys-valued intellectual companion, and falling into a gentle footi-
pace, continued the scientific discussion with deep interest,  anda
wanderful clearness of perception.
It is quite curious to me, Crockley,'' he said, `` to observe
how common sense and observation will often make aman of to-
lerable ability hit upon the very same facts, and come exactly to
the very same conclusions as the man of science, who has passed

mere unlettered use of them a delight, are banished for ever and for
ever. The ceaseless whirring of a . million hissing wheels, seizes
on the tortured ear: and while threatening to destroy the delicate
sense, seems bent on proving first, with a sort of mocking mercy,
of how much suffering it can be the cause. The scents that reek
around, from oil, tainted water, and human filth, with that last
worst nausea, arising from the hot refuse of atmospheric air, left
by some hundred pairs of labouring lungs, render the act of breath-.
ing a process of diculty, disgust, and pain. AIl this is terrible.
But what the eye brings home to the heart of those, who look round
upon the horrid earthly hell, is enough to makce it all forgotten: for
who can think of illanous smells, or heed the suffering of the ear-
racking sounds, while they look upon hundreds of helpless children,
iisested of every trace of health, of joyousness, and even of youth:
Assuredly there is no exaggeration in this; for except only
in their diminutive size, these suffering infants have no tracee
of it, Lean and distaorted limbs-sallow and sunken cheeks-
dim hollow eyes, that speak unrest and most unnatural carefulness,
gie to eaceh tiny, trembling, unelastic form, a look of hideous pre-
mature old age.
But in the room they entered, the dirty, rgged, miserable crew,
were all in active performance of their various tasks; the over-
lookers, strap in hand, on the alert: the hirling spindles urging
the little slaves who waited on them, to movements as unceasing as
their own; an the whole monstrous chmber, redolent of all the
various impurities that ` by the perfection of our manufacturing
system,'' are converted into `` gales of Araby'' for the rich, afer
passing in the shape of certain poison, through the lungs of the
poor. So Sir Miatthew prondly looked about him., and approved;
and thongh it was athwart that species of haughty frown, in which
such dignity as his is apt to clothe itself, Dr. Crockley failel not
to perceive, that his friend and patron was in good humour, and
likely to be pleased by any light and lively jestings in which he
might indulge. Perceiving, therefore, that little MIichael passed on
with downcast eyes, unrecognised by any, he wrote upon a slip of
paper, for he knew his voice could not be heard ` Make the boy
take that bare-legged scavenger wench round the neck, and give
her a kiss while she is next lying down, and let us see them sprawl-
ing together.''
Sir MIatthew read the scroll, and grinned applause.

was to collect incessantly from the machinery and from the floor,
the flying fragments of cotton that might impede the work. In
the performance of this duty, the child was obliged, from time to
time, to stretch itself with sudden quickness on the ground, while
the hissing machinery passed over her; and when this is skilfully
done, and the head, body, and outstretched limbs carefully glued
to the floor, the steady-moving, but threatening mass, may pass and
repass oer the dizzy head and trembling body without touching it.

Dut accidents frequently occur: and many are the flaxen loeks,
rudely torn from infant heads, in the process.
It was a sort of vague hope that something comical of this kind
mnight occur, which induced Dr. Crockley to propose this frolic to
his friend, and probably the same idea suggested itself to Sir Mat-
thew likewise.
I say, MIaster Michael' ociferated the knight in a scream,
which successfully struggled with the din, ``show your old ac-
quaintance that pride has not got the upper hand of you in your
fine clothes. Take scavenger, No. 3, there, round the neck; now
--now-now, as she lies sprawling, and let us see you give her a
hearty kiss.''
The stern and steady machinery moved onward, passing over the
body of the little girl, who owed her safety to the miserable lean-
ness of her shrunken frame; but Michael moved not.
Are you deaf, you little vermin'' rored Sir Matthew. s Now
sle's down again.-Do what 1 bid you, or by the living God you
shall smart for it''
Siill Mlichael did not stir, neither did he speak; or if he did,
his young voice was wholly inaudible, and the anger of Sir Matthew
was demonstrated by a clenched fist and threatening brow, se Where
the devil is Parsons ?'' he demanded in accents that poor Michael
both heard and understood.  Fine as he is, the strap will do him
good.''
In saying this, the great man turned to reconnoitre the space he
had traversed, and by which his confidential servant must approach,
and found that he was already within a goed yard of him.
 That's good-I want yo Parsons. Do you see this little rebel
here, that I have dressed and treated like one of my own children ?
Wht d'ye think of his refusing to kiss DMiss No. 3, seavenger,
when I bid him 22
 The devil he does ?'' said the manager grinning; `` we must see
if we can't mend that. Mind your hits, Master Piecer, and salute
the young lady when the mules go back, like a gentleman.''
Sir MIatthew perceived that his favourite agent feared to enforce his
first brutal command, and was forced, therefore, to content himself
with seeing the oiled and grimy face of the filthy littlegirl in contact
with that of the now clean and delicate-looking Michael. But he
felt he had heen foiled, and cast a glance upon his protige, whichi
seemed to promise that he would not forget it.
Ilaving made known to the superintendent, that it was his plea-
sure to cnter the room where the brother of Michael was at work,
MIr. Parsons led the way to the fifth floor of the building; Sir
Mlatthew, however, ordering the door of each chamber, as he passed
up, to be opened for him, that he might look in upon his stifling
slaves, and satisfy himself that neither wheels nor sinews were
loiering in nnthrifty repose
The air that issued from each, was nauseous; and on entering

scended to veil the feeling by a smile more bland than any one ever
before witnessed from him within those walls ; and striding forwards to
the sohbing children, he laid a hand on the shoulder of each, while he
said in a voice that seemed endowed by nature with an especial
power of competing with the thunder of a cotton-mill-
Come, come, my dearsl I know you are crying for joy; but
you must not go on so, or it will look as if little Mlichael was un-
grateful for allI have done for him1 Have you told your brother,
dear, how I ordered yon to take some nice things home to your
mother? That will make him look up, I'll answer for it1 There,
now I'll leave you here that you may tell all your friends that you
have been made a gentleman of, on account of your good behaviour,
and because you was faithful to your master. Let them have ten
minutes, Parsons, with the mules standing still, that they may all
hear the story.''
Sir Matthew then turned about, and hastened out of the factory,
followed by Dr. Crockley ; and as they slowly rade homewards by
some round-about lanes that were shaded from the sun, they dis-
cussed high thoughts,
---. uch as Lycurgus loved,
When he bade log tue little Spartana''
And erc they eached the luxurious abode of the knight, hal be-
teen them sketched such a scheme of politicnl, moral, anl reli-
gious defence for the factory system in all its branches, and in all
its bearings, that the doctor as he descended from his horse, sapped
his fingens tsiumphantly, exclaiming, `' A fig for them all, Sir Mat-
thew? If they mine, egal wc'll countermine, and we start with a
pretty tolerablc advantage. You are a man of science, Sir Mat-
thew Dowling: and I need not tell you, that a powerful movement
once in action, is devilish hard to stop. The vis inerti will work
for us, my friend-not to mention that when the animals find out
their only alternative is labour or starvation-labour, such and
so much as yow in your bounty will be pleased to bestow-they will
all grow as patient as so many sucking doves,''
These words were spoken as they slowly mounted together the
steps of the stately portico; Sir Matthew, as a reply, shook his
friend cordially by the hand, and leading the way to the coeol and
ofty library, ordered iced water and claret, to wash away the effect
of their half-hour's visit to the factory.

TIE maasion of Miss Brotherton, at the distance of three miles
from the town of Ashleigh, though less splendid in esternal ap-
pearance than that of Sir Matthew Dowling, was quite as elabo-
rately elegant in its interior, and moreover, incomparably superior
to it in every point in which taste was concerned. To this superh
home we must now follow the young heiress, as circumstances will
hereafter frequently blend her name with that of Michael Arm-
strong.
The position of Mary Brotherton was a ery singular one. and
in many respects far from being fortunate. At the age of twenty-
one years and eight months, she found herself, by the death of her
mother, in the uncontrolled possession of two hundred thousand
pounds. Her father, dead some six or seven years before, had been
a manufacturer of the old apprentice-system school, and his fortnne
made long before the humane bill of Sir Robert Peel, the elder,
had, in some degree, weakened the chains which bound thousands
of friendless orphans to unmeasured and unmitigated drudgery.'
But of all these circumstances, his daughter was totally and al-
together ignorant. Educated, from a vesry early age, at a fashionable
London boarding-school, she knew nothing concerning the neigh-
bourhood of her home, but that its hills and valleys were deformed by
tall chimneys and dirty smoke; and that none of the youog ladies
who paid her visits during the holidays, were at all like her school-
fellows in London.
Of course, the little lady soon learned to know that she was a
person of great consequence; and at the age of fourteen, had
inost completely aequired all the airs and graces of a spoiled child.
But the death of her father was a great advantage to her; as his
only child, and the only heir of his imense wealth, he rather wor-
shipped than loved her, and the attentions he paid her, seemed
more like acts of homage than of affection. Had she not given
herself airs, he would have been miserable; and had it been pos-
sible that any act of hers could bring upon her a reprimand, it
would have been something indicating her belief, that she was
formed of the same sortof materials as the wretches who toiled for
him.
Fortunately, however, she was fond of her mother, who, being

a great invalid, lised quietly in the midst of her splendour: and
the holidays of her daughter were thus passed quietly too, which
saved her from much early adulation. She had remained at school
till nearly eighteen; and from that time, to the period of her mo-
ther's death, which happened about fifteen months hefore the open-
ing of this narrative, she had lci a life of great retirement, dividing
her time between attendance in her sick mother's chamber, gallop-
ing about the country on horseback, and reading every book she
could get hold of, good, bad, and indifferent.
On first finding herself alone in her own great house, the poor
gil wept bitterly. Hcr mother's increasing sufferings had long
made her release from them an event to be ardently desired by the
only being who loved her; but when at last it came, and she had
herself to think of, and nobody else, there was something almost
terrible in her utter loneliness. She was peronally acquainted
with very few in the neighbourhood, and felt no afection for any
of them. Of relations, to the best of her knowledge and beliel,
she possessed not one in the world; and with alli her advantages,
for she ha many, being young, pretty, talented, and rich, she
would gladly have changed places during the first weeks of her
dismal mourning, witch any girl of her own age who had father,
mother, brother, and sisters to love, and be loved by.
Mrs. Gabberly was the nearest neighbour she had on one sidc,
and Lady Clarissa Shrimpton on the other, and both these ladies
had oceeasionally bcen admitted to see her mother till within a few
days of her death. When, therefore, this long-expected event
at length took place, they both thought themselves privileged to
assume the freedom of intimate friends, and penetrate to the lone
boudoir of the mournful heiress. Fortunate for her it was, that
they did so; for though neither of them possessed any single
quaulity of sufficient value to win and wear the esteem, or even the
liking, of an acute, clearsighted observer, such as the half-spoiled
heiress certainly was; it was better to hear the sound of almost
any human voice uttering words of kindness, than to sitlonely and
apart, and hear none; so that neither the twaddling larum of Mrs.
Gahberly, nor the absurd affeclation of Lady Clarissa were withont
their use.
It might, however, have been somewhat dangerous to the moral
development of the young lady's characeter,. had she Iong continued
to find her only relief from sorrow and solitude in the society of
persons who could only amuse her by their absurdities. Almost
the first time she exertd herself for the purpose of pursuing some
of her ordinary occupations, she drew forth her drawing-box, and
produced a caricature of Lady Clarissa reciting verses from the
pen of Mr. Norval;: and the first observations she committed ta
papecr, were the result of a tolerably accuratc counting of the num-
ber of times Mirs. Gahberly had uttered  Well now1'' during her
last visit.

g
 Well now, my dearl I have been thinking that what you must
do, is to find out nmong your friends an acquaintance, some re-
spectable person in the situation of a gentlewoman to lie with you.
Somebody already known in the nighbourhood, would be the most
desirable, because then you would not lave the trouhle of intro-
ducing her; for of course it will be in no wise promper for so young a
person as you are to visit about, oven in the country, withouta
proper chaperone.''
Again the cushions were slightly moed, but this time it was not
a start, but a shudder which caused it.
: Vell now, my dear Maryl'' resumed the friendly Mrs. Gab-
berly; `` what do you think about it?''
It reuires longer time than l have yet had, before I can an-
swer your question, Mrs. Gabberly,'' replied the young lady.
 Wel1 now1 that's very truc, and very lisereet, and sensible;
and God forbid, my dear, that I should make you do any thing in
a hurry. Only you must not forget that every boly will be on the
look out to observe what you do. Depend upon it, that they won't
wait to make their remarks-that's all.''
The heiress retained her neditative position, but said nothing.
Don't you think what I have said is true, my denr?''
Mary bowed her head, but without changing the position of tle
hand which concealed her face.
 I wish she would look up at me,'' thought Mrs. Gabberly; I
might guess then, perhaps, if there was any chance for me.''
 It would be a comfort, as well as a protection, wouldn't it,
my ear, to have a kind, affectionate friand, always near youl1''
Mary bowed again
e Wall now I wish you would open your dear heart, and spcak
out. Tell me, don't you feel very lonesome, when you sit down to
dinner?''
:I have been long used to that, Mrs. Gabherly.''
 Yes; but then you had not got to think all the time, as I am
sure you must do now, that there was obody near you; that thero
was oboly in the whole great house but your own self, besides the
servants; that there was abody to drink your health; nobody to
say won't you take a little bit more, my dear: Nobody to say isn't
this very nice? Nobody to give you a nod and a smile when you

Now isn't this all dismal?'
 Very dismal, ma'amI' repliedl the young laey in a oice
that showved plainly eneugh, that the picture was not an indifferent
Oe.
Well now1 tat's saying something: and I can't help think-
ing, dear MIary1 I can't help saying, that it has come into my head,
that if--
MIrc. GabberlyI' cried Miss Brotherton, starting suddenly up.
tI must now beg you to leaveme. You have described ny situa-
tion so forcibly, that I fecl more than ever the necessity of making

somne arrangement that may better it. But I will not do this with-
out reflection. Leave me, now. I thank you for your kind con-
cern, nnd when next you calli upon me, you shall find that what
you have said has not been disregarded,''
 wVellnow, that's all right, and I'll go directly. Shall it be to-
morrow, dear, that I call again?'
No, ma'am, if you please, not till next Saturday,''
Saturday? Why, my dear, this is only Monday-it is a great
while for me to live in such suspense about you, dearest,''
 No, ma'am, not very long. Saturday it must be if you
please; and I shall be happy if you will stay and dine here on that
day.''
 Thank you, my dear. I shall like that ery, very much in-
deed. And then we can talk every thing over, my dear Mary.
God bless you, my love. Take care of yourself, dearest, till Satur-
day; and just let me say one word in your ear at parting. Re-
member, that there is nobody in the whole wide world that loves
you as much as I do.''
MIiss Irotherton submitted herself passively to the embrace
which followed; and when the door closed aftcr her affectionate
neighbour, she stood, as it seemed, patiently, while her sharp, short
retreating footsteps were heard along the spacious corridor, and
when they were heard no more she applied her hand to the bell.
But something made her pause ere she rang it, and stepping to a
window, that openel upon a balcony filled with skilfully-shaded
exotics, she peeped forth from among them, till the active-moving
little figure of MIrs. Gabberly trudging aleng the drive below,
became visible, and then the heiress turned again to the bell-rope,
and pulled it vigorously.
 Tll nurse Tremlett-tell Mrs. Tremlett to be so kind as to
come to me immediately,'' was the order given to the servant who
answered it.
After the interal of a few minutes, during which Mliss Brother-
ton stood with her arm resting on the mantelpiece, with a counte-
nance and attitude of deep meditation, the door opened again, and
a pale, thin, little old woman entered, who, had not her wrinkles
an gray locks betrayed her, might have passed for five-and-tenty,
so active and nicely moulded was her little person. But despite
her still clear and bright black eye, her face showed that she could
not honestly count less than twice that sum of years.
Come in, dear nursel'' said Mliss Brotherton kindly, `` come
in, and sit down by me.''
The old woman obeyed this command without further ceremony:
and, by her manner of doing it, showed plainly that it was not an
InCOmmon one.
 What have you been about, my child?'' said she, `` you don't
look well''
1 dare say not,'' replied Mary abruptly, I have been hored
and plagued, nurse Tremlett; and nos I am going to bore and
plague you, in order to comfort myself.''
O ICHAEL ARsTRONG.
89
For all answer, the chartered nurse put her arm round the young
lady's neck, an gave her a rery loving kiss.
.2Nay, it is very true, Mrs. Tremlett; and no joke in it, I do
assure you. I am going to make a terrible change in your manner
of life, my dear old woman. I am going to make a state-prisoner
of you.''
You may plague and puzzle your old nurse as much as you like,
my darling, so yo will but smile and look a little less dismal than
you have done of late. And what is it you are' going to do to
me, Miss Mary I dare say it is nothiag that I shall think very
hard.''
I dan't know that, Mrs. Tremlett,'' replied Mrs. Brotherton
very gravely.
Mrc, Tremlett, and Mrs. Tremlett,'' said the old woman, look-
ing earaestly at her, ``what does that mean, Miss Mary ?-I don't
like it.''
I know you won't like it. But you must bear that, and a great
deal more, my dear old fiend. You must make up your mind to
lead a uew life altogether; and I am very much afraid that you
will not like the change.''
OhI goodness, Miss Mary, what is it youmean? You are not
gOing to send me away from you, are you ?''
'Is that the worst thing I could do to vex you'' said the young
Iady, very cordially returning the caress she had received; ``you
need not be afraid of that, at any rate. The misfortune I threaten
is of quite a diflerent kind,''
WVell, then I shan't mind it; let it he what it will. But I
uon't think it isany thing very bad, my dear; for you look as if you
were ready to laugh, though you try to look grave, and talk of a
misfortune.,''
 It will be no misfortune to me, I assure you, but quite the
contrary. I shall like it very much, and that is the reason you see
me ready to smile; and if you will be a dear good woman, and make
no dificulties about it, all will gao well. Mrs. Gabberly has been
here, nurse Tremlett; and she tells me that l must immediately
take some elderly lady into the house, to sit with me and take care
of me; because, as she says, I am too young to live alone, and
that all the neighbourhool will be making remarkss upon me.''
 Well, my dear, and I dare say she says no more than the
truth. Your great fortune, and your prettiness, and all that, will
certainly bring many and many an eye upon you, my dear child;
and, olf course, it won't do for you to go on without having some
steady lady of a companion like, to be living with you.''
 Iut I hate all ladies that would come to live as a companion
lile,'' replied the yung lady.  what should I do with a MIiss
Mlogg, rotting about after me, to ask if I wanted my smelling-
bottle, or my pg-dog And that is not the worst that could
happen to me either. As sure as you are there, nurse Tremlett,
Mrs, Gabberly has made up her mind to come arid live here as my
companion herself''

smile and a shake of the head, that seemel to say, '`I know you
must have your own way, Mary.''
And thus was conceived and established a mode of life for the
pretty heiress, which left her as completely uncontrolled as to all
she did, and all she said, as if nurse Tremlett still occupied her
qarters in what was once called the nursery, but had since become
the favoured nurse's sitting-oom.
Mary's delight in dressing and drilling the old woman for her
new dutics, was childish and excessive: and most triumphant was
the satisfaction with which she perceived that rich black silks, and
delicate white crape, performed their office upon her nice little per-
son so effectually, as te give her quite as much the air of a gentle-
woman, as the majority of those who were likely to meet her.
So, on the following Saturday, Mrs. Gahberly found Miss Bro-
therton no longer the solitary occupant of her elegant boudoir, but
with a remarkably well-dressed clderly lady, seated in the most
luxurious of all the newly-invented chairs which decorated the
apartmcnt, with a small work-table before her; while on the foot-
stool at her feet, sat the heiress, lookting a vast deal more happy
than she had ever before seen her.
The mystification did not last long. The eyes of Mrs. Gabberly
were of that happy fabric, which enablcs the owner to retain for
ever the memory of every face they have ever looked upon: and it
waS with heightened colour, and no very sweet expression of coun-
enance, that she exclaimed,  Soh1 you have taken your old nurse,
Tremlett, to sit with you?''
My nurse no longer, but my most kind friend, Mrs. Gabberly,
who has affectionately consented to forsake many of her former
comforts, in order to be useful to me. You will perceive, ma'am,
that your advice has not been lost upon mc.''
WYell nowI that is a strange whim, Miss Brotherton. But of
course, you are not serious in trying to make me bclioeve that it is
your intention to let nurse Tremlett assist you in receiving your
company. If it be so, I think it but fair to tell you at once, as my
expericncee is rather greater than yours, that not one single soul
among all our rich folks, will cnre to visit you at all. I don't wish
to aflront you, nurse Tremlett; but you won't contradict what I
say, I am quite sure of that.''
Ms. Tremlett showcd hcrself an apt scholar, for she bowsed he
head, went on with her knitting, and said nothing.
If she was silent, however, Miss Brotherton was not. `' Listen

may neer be alluded to again. I am left, Mrs. Gabberly, as lI

fortune, with unlimited power to spond it as I please. Now I do
not please to spend any part of it in putting myself under circum-

rissa, and the poet, her eye suddenly became fixed upon the beau-
tiful clild who had been brought in for general examination. lLike
most other ready limners of the human face, Mliss Brotherton had
considerable skill in physiognomy. and ere she had long gazed on
the pretty, nicely-dressed, little boy, she felt persuaded that in spite
of his gay habit de fte, the child was ill at ease, and under great
discomfort.
It is difficult for persons residing at a distance, and ot ` to the
manner born,'' to conceive the extraordinary degree of ignorance in
which the ladies of the great manufacturing families are brought up,
as to the real condition of the people employedl in the concern from
whence their wealth is derived.
There is, however, a homely proverb that may help to explain
this: ' You should never speak of a rope in the house of a man
that was hanged,'' and it is probahly on the same principle, thatno
oue speaks of the factory in the house of the manufacturer. Be
this as it may, the factis certain, and Mary Brotherton, like perhaps
a hundred other rich young ladies, of the same class, grew up in
total ignorance of the moans and the misery that lurked beneath
the unsightly edifices, which she just knew were called the factories,
but which were mnch too ugly in her picturesque eyes for her ever
to look at them, when she could help it.
lLittle did the kind-tempered, warm-hearted gil guess, tat for
hours before she raised her healthy and elastic frame from the couch
where it had luxuriously reposed through the night, thousands of
sickly, suffering, children were torn from their straw pallets, to com-
mence a long unvaried day of painful toil, to fill the ever-craving
purses, of which her own was one. She knew that Sir Matthew Dow-
ling wns considered as the richest man in the district-richer even
than her father had been, and this was all she knew about him, ex-
cept that her own sharp observation had enabled her to perceive
that he was ignorant, vulgar, and most ludicrously crammed with
prctensions of all sorts.
After having looked into the face of little Michael, till she was
perfectly convinced of his being exceedingly unhappy, she next di-
rected her atiention to his benefactor, as she heard him clamorously
hailed on all sides; and his countenance, though smiling, spoke a
language she liked not. It was evident tn her that he was very
keenly watching the boy, and more than once she detected a look
from Sir MIatthew, directed towards him, which was instantly fol-
lowed by an attempt on the child's part to look less miserable.
Then followed all the nonsense about Mr. Osmond Norval, and
his promised drama, which was to place upon the scene some proli-
giously generous action of Sir Matthew Dowling's, towards this
liutle boy. Mary Irotherton did not believe a word of it, and sick
of the fulse and fulsome flattery that was bandied about between the
knight, the lady, and the poet, she made, as we have seen, a some-
what hasty retreat.
On her road home she was more than usually silent, being occu-
pied in a meditation on the features of Mlichael Armstrong. For

 1 only speak after much that I have heart, and a little thnt I
have seen,'' replicl the old woman meekly.  However, my dear,
dear MIiss Brotherton,'' she added,  if you will take an old ser-
vants advice, who Ioves you ery dearly, you will just make up
your mind, neither to talk, nor to think any motre upon the subject.
I am quite sure that it will give you no pleasure, and it does not seem
possible to me that you should do any good; for you know, my
dear, that you have nothing at all to do with any of the factories
now, any more than Lady Clarissa herself. WiIl you promise to
take my advice, my dear child, and think no more about it2''
On the contrary, Mrs. Tremlett,'' replied the young lady; :1
am perfectly delermined that for some time to come I will think of
nothing else,''
MIary Brotherton kept her word. During the whole time that the
Dowling Lodge theatricals were in preparation, whils every other
young heart in the neighbourhood, male or female, was eagerly anti-
cipating the fcte, hers was fixed steadfast and immoveable upon the
mysterious subject that had seized upon it. That man was born to
Iabour, that he was conlemned to live by the sweat af his brow, she
knew from high authority: and though under the social compacts
which civilization has led to, some portion of every race have found the
means of performing the allotted task vicariously, she felt not called
wpon to say tbat the arrangcment was a bad one. It was by no meane
difficult to conceive why it was so, nor why of necessity it ever must
be so. She felt, as all must lo, who reflect on the subjeect, that if all
distinctions were by some accident suddenly removed, and the entire
organization of society to begin de novo, each man standing precisely
on the same level as his neighbour, the earth would not complete one
revolution round the sun, ere the equality would be violated.
Strength wilt be lord of imbecility''
And when nature made one man more active, more intelligent, or
more powerful of frame than another, she made the Iaw in which ori-
ginaed inequality of condition. That, as time rolled on, and mankind
became bound together nation by nation, substituting the conventional
distinctions of eivilized society for those derivel from indivilual
strength,-that when this Iappened, occasional anomalies should appear
in the arrangement, seemed ihevitable, and of necessity to be endured
That it was inevitable, she conceived to be pretty nearly proved by the
fact that no single authentic record makes mention of a nation in
which hereditary distinction of some kind or other did not exist. No
did it seem esirahle that when the prowess, the wit, the wisdom, er
the toil of an individual had endowed him -with wealth beyond his
fellows, he should be denied the dear privilege of endowing withal the
children he loved, instead of leaving it at his death to be stuggled
for, and borne away by the most crafty or the most strong. All this,

certain than usual that her presence would not be wanted, had made
p her mind to enjoy herself till the time arried for the com-
mencement of the play, when it was her purpose to join the large
party invited, in their progress from the drawing-room to the
theatre.
On receiving Miss Drotherton's card, however, she hastily resumed
the business of her toilet; for though the summons was as unintel-
ligible to her as to her sisters, she felt, at least, an equal desire that
it should be civilly complied with. It never took long to make poor
MIartha as smart as she eer thought it necessary to be, and in a very
few minutes she joined Miss Brotherton in the drawing-room.
This is very kind of you, Miss Martha. I hope I have not hurried
ou?'' said the heiress, taking her hand so kindly, that the shy girl
could not but feel enceouraged to speak to her with rather more con-
fidence than usual.
 WVhy are you not going to take a part ?'' was the next question.
I take a part Oh1 Miss Brotherton what should I make of
acting ''' said Martha, laughing and blushing, in reply.
Nay 1 think you are very right, Mlartbha. I assure you nothing
could hase persuaded me to have made the attempt. But I thought
that if you did not play, you would perhaps hae the kindness to
take charge of me, and let me sit by you; for nless I have somebody
to tell me what it all means I1 shall be horribly puzzled.''
I will tell you every thing l can,'' replied Martha, good-
humouredly.  But I don't think I understand much about it
myself,'
 What sort of a little boy is it that yous papa has been so kind
to: Every body is talking about it, and Lady Clarissa sys there is
something quite sublime in what he is geing to do for him. Butl
suppose Sir Matthew must have remarked some qualities particularly
amiable and good in the child, or he would not distinguish him so
remarkably from all others of the same class.''
 You have heard the story of his saving Lady Clarissa Shrimpton
from the cow that was going to toss her, have you not, DMIiss Bro-
therton 2
 Yes, my dear, I heard all that, you know, the morningI was here;
-though, by the by, you were not in the room, I remember. But there
must be something maore in it than that. Do tell me all you know,''
Indeed I don't know any thing more,'' said Martha.
 What sort of a child is i2
A ery nice little fellow indeel, and I think if I had been papa l
should have done the same thing myself.''
 ReallyI Then you do think this child is something out of the
common way, I suppose? Pray tell me, dear Martha, will you, if you
hear much about the people that work in the factoriesl and the chil-
dren in particular 2''
No, indeed, Mliss Brotherton, I know nothing in the world about
them: except that lI sometimes hear papa say that they are all very idle
and ungrateful,'' replied Martha.
o MICIIAEL ARMISTRONG.
101
I have been told that they are a very wretched set of people.
But, perhaps, they cannot help it. Martha?'' returned Miary.
I do not know how that can be, Miss Brotherton; every body can
help being idle, and every body can help being ungrateful, I1 should
think.''
 Bnt it seems that they all live together, and make one another
worse ; and, in that case, the children are very much to be pitied; for,
poor little things, they cannot help themselves. What makes yo
think this little boy is a nice child? Hae you ever talkel to him
much 2'
Yes, a good deal;: but papa has been taking him ahut to a great
many houses: and besides, he has been occupied very much in learn-
ing his part, for Duo, who was tecaching him, said that he coult hardly
read at all. Sao I have been trying to help him, and he is very quick.
But I like him, too, beeause he appears so fond of his mother and bro-
ther. He cares for nothing that can be given him, unless he can take
some of it to them.''
`And does your papa let him do so?''
Oh1 yes, every day.''
 That is very kiid. Then I suppose the little fellow is superlatively
happy:'
1 don't knaw,'' replied Martha, with a slight shake of the head.
I is very strange if he he not,'' observed Miss Brotherton. eIt
he were kept from his mother I could easily understand that he might
be very miserable, notwithstanding the great good luck that has be-
fallen him; but if he is permitted to see her constantly, I can't imagine
what he can want more.''
I don'i know,'' again repliel MIartha.
The expeeted guests began now rapidly to assemble, and refresh-
ments were handed round previous to their being conducted to the rom
prepared for the evening's amusement. : Don't forsake me, dear
Martha'' whispered Miss Brotherton, ` I am not very intimate with
any of these ladies and gentlemen, and I shallnot enjoy the evening's
amusement, unless lI am seated next you,''
Martha felt a good deal surprisel at the compliment, but readily
agreed to thc proposal; and in a few minutes, Lady bDowling, who was
any thing rather than pleased by the whole affair, gave the assembled
party to understand that the time fixed for their entering the theatre
had arrived.
On tiptoe with curiosity, and eager beyond measure, to see what
Iady Clarissa Shrimpton, Mr. Oemond Norval, and : all the Dow-
lings'' would look like on the stage, the numerous company almost
ran over one another in the vehement zeal with which they prepared tao
obey her.
Of course no cxpense had been sparel in fitting np the apartment
allotted to the purpose, in form and style as like as might be to a
theatre; and, thanks to the taste and ingenuity of the little French
governess, the thing had been not only expensively, but well done.
The space railed in for the orchestra very conveniently divided the

high, and dressed, in all respects, precisely as he had been on the
memorable night of Lady Clarissa's vaccine adventure.
In dumb show the lady indicated the direction from whence the
dreaded monster would approach; and the most energetic and un-
sparing action of the limbs and person secured the audience, as well as
her deliverer, from any possible mistake on the subject. MJichael, too,
performed his part with great spirit, exaggerating, as he had been
commanded, by every possible means, the maneuvres necessary for
turning the front of a cow.
To this scene, too, the audience gave loud applause, and in the
midst of it entered Sir MIatthew, who was, of course, greeted by bravoes,
`Iong drawn onut,'' till the ladies and gentlemen having nearly
deafened one another, ceased at last, and listened to the beautiful
explanation which followed.
First the company were made to comprehend that the danger was
over, for the well-taught Mlichael turned about, and manfully facing
the audience, pronounced distinctly
Tle besst is gone'
Then Sir Matthew, after bowing respectfully to the lady, said,
PerIit me, madm. to express my joy,
That you'vre been sared by this gaod little boy.''
It was, however, uttered in an accent of such temperate and measured
feeling, that not een ILady Dowliug saw any thing very particular in
it. A precaution by the way, which had been suggested by the gen-
tlemen during the frequent rehearsals.
Lady Clarissa's acting then became animated indeed; for the poet,
following her instructions, had composed for her in smooth, yet
startling rhymes, about thirty lines of the most fervent thanksgiving,
in which, uow laying one hand on the head of the ragged child, now
clasping both together in the eagerness of her address to Sir MIatthew,
and now gracefully extending both arms towards the audience, as if
to make them sharers in her generous emotions, she produced an efletct
more easily imagined than descrihed.
The speech which followed from Sir Matthew was ery noble, and
at once let the audience into all the secret purposes of his benevolent
heart. The by-play of Michael during this scene had been prepared
for by his benefactor with particular care, but somehow or other the
boy was not apt in catching the knight's idea; for instead of the ten-
der hut joyous smile with which he had been instructed to look up
into the face of his munificent patron, his countenance expressed
nothing but terror.
That litule fellow does not losk happy, Martha,'' whispered Miss
Drotherton.
Ol no: he looks very frightened,'' replied Martha, `` but that is
very natural, is il not, considering the noelty of his situation 7''
I don't know,'' said the heiress.

The piece went on to exhibit the beautiful manner in which this
adoption of a ragged factory-boy into the bosom of the Dowling family
had heen hailed by all'of them as an especial grace from heaven, on
account of the opportunity it afforled for relieving the overflowing
generosity of their hearts. Sir MNiatthew, while looking eunl e
his sixteen full-dressed offspring, who were now again skilfully
grouped upon the stage, was made to exclaim with clasped hands,
and an almost sobbing excess of emotion,
 The wiiaw and the orphan are more dear,
To their young hearts, than million pounds a year'
Every body was touched, and again the applause was deafening.
Then came a very striking scene indeed. Michael appeared
superbly dressed, anl on each side of him was a middling-sized Miss
Dowling, holding lightly and gracefully euch a little busket, from
under the covers of which peeped out grapes and peaches on the one
side, and something that had the semblance of a flask of wine on the
other.
Then spoke the fair-haired Louisa.
Dear little ba, this basket's nll yor on.
Ti to rewrd the courage you have shown.''
And then Miss Charlotte.
So is this too, my prelty little boy,
We hope 'rwill gire yeur poor old rother iay.''
And when Michael, having received a basket in each hand, appeared
preparing to depart, the two young ladies exclaimed together,
Tis paps aends it, who's so very kind,
IIow to do good, is all ue seks o fn?'
Upon this, Michael turned round again towards the audience, and
stood stock still. It was quite evident that he had some speech ta
make which he had apparently forgotten, for it was impossible for any
child to look more completely distrcssed and at a loss.
At length it became pretty evident that, in lieun of all other per-
formance, the poor boy was going to cry; and some ingenious per-
sons doubted whether it might not be in his part to do so; but this
idea was speedily removed by the very matter-of-fact pokes and
nudges which the two young ladies bestowed upon him. In addition
to this it seemed as if the little fellow caught somne stimulating sounds
from the coulisses, for he cast more than one furtive glance in that
direction, and at length, with what was evidently a great effort, he
stammered out,
 My mother'as desr, and so's my brother too,
But learer still are your pap and yo.
IIis charity'a so grest, his heart so good,

And I for-one-will.-day-and night-in prasyer,

The two last lines were so completely choked by the tears, which
all his efforts could not suffice to restrain, that they were perfectly
unintelligible to the audience.
Is all that vehemence of weeping a part of Mr. Norval's com-
position?'' inquired Miss Brotherton in a whisper to Martha.
Upon my word I don't know: bnt I should think not,'' was the
reply.
 Marthal'' said the heiress, very earnestly, `` that child is suffering
from an agony of terror.''
I should hope not,'' said Martha, in a voice that somewhat
faltered.
Do you know any thing about this boy ?'' pursued Miss Bro-
therton, continuing her whispering.  Do you know any thing about
the mother he talks of z''
e Nothing whatever, Miss Brotherton.''
 Do you feel quite satisfied, my dear, that this romantic adventure
has been, or will be, advantageous to him?''
I think,'' replied Martha, ``that one can harlly donbt his being
`better off here than in the poverty of his mother's dwelling. YTou saw,
Miss bBrotherton, what a rgged condition the clothes were in which
he had worn before,''
 Decent clothes are a comfort, my dear Martha, there can be no
doubt of it; but compared with the other circumstances which in-
fluence the happiaess of life, they are of no great importance. Of
course I suppotse that your fathcr means to educate him. Do you
know whcther he can read his bible yet2''
1 know that he could not,'' replied Martha, "`when he came
here.''
Poor little wetch1 That is very terrible neglect somewhere.
What sort of person is the mother?''
 By Michael's account,'' replied Martha, smiling, ``she is a very
estimable person indeed; but it certainly seems that she has not taken
much pains with his education, poor little fellow :'
 what a sad thing it is,'' continued Miss Brotherton, `` that we all
of us know so little of the poor people employed in the factories1 I
believe they are said to he exceedingly well pui, but still I don't
think it is quite right for the rich people in a neigbbourhood to take

tenants and work-people, and of their schools, and their clothing
societies, and all sorts of things, and Ihare been trying to do a little
good just at home with the families of some of the work-people about
the plaee. But I hae just now got my head strangely full of these
factory folks. I wish you could give me some information about
them, Martha.''
Indeed, my dear Miss Brotherton, I know as littleas yondo. I am
told that they are very good-fot-nothing, that they receive enormous
sums annually in wages, and yet that they are never contented, but

from the subject to which she appeared sa earnestly to have devoted
them. For she said in the low, slow, even tone, which denotes con-
centrated feeling-
If this be so, Miss MIartha Dowling, if thousands of human beings
in a Christian country are stigmatized as wicked, because their destiny
has placed them in a peculiar employment, tbat employment ought to
be swsept for ever and for ever from the lan, though the wealth that
flowed from it outweighed the treasures of MIexico,''
Martha Dowling started, but said not a word in reply; there was
something in the manner of her neighbour which awed her. True,
genuine, deep feeling, is always sublime, be it manifested by sucha
yong girl as Mlary Drotherton, or such an old king as Lear. But,
though Martha was silent, her companion suffered not the conversation
to drop; and presently resumed in a tone of less exaltation,-` Do
you think, my dear, that 1 could get hold of your little Mlichael some
day, so thatl might have a little conversation with him?''
Yes, certainly, Miss Brotherton,'' replied Miartha, 'I think papae
would be quite pleased, for he seems to like nothing better than seeing
every'body take notice of him.''
 Do you think your father loves the little boy, Martha''
`I am sure he is very kind to him,'' replied the conscious daughter a
little piqued.   For it can be nothing but kindness that makes him
take the child into the house, and feed him and clothe him for nothing.''
' And, of course, Martha, he will get some instruction here?''
Oh1 he has begun to read the bible already,'' replied the kind-
hearted girl, eagerly. Ihave undertaken that business myselft. The
poor little fellow seemed to suffer so, when he was learning his parta

 One almost wonders at that too: brought up, as he must have
been, in the very lap of ignorance. I should have thought, after all I
have heard, that he would have been ashamed of nothing. However,
I should like to talk to him. At what hour do you give him his realing

nutes, and yawning rather more conspicuously than politeness could
warrant.

the yawn.
There was, however, a good deal to be done. There was a figure
dance to be performed, and a trio to be played on the pianoforte, harp,
and violoncello, by the two eldest Miss Dowlings, and their music-
naster,
This last was a very long business: and the heiress, who, instead of
having been instructed to endure annoyances patiently, had been
rather taught never to endure them at all, got up in the middle of it,
and telling MIartha that her head ached too much to permit her re-
maining any longer, made her way out of the room, which she effected
the morc easily from having taken her station near a side door, which
led from tho theatre (in ordinary phrse, the school-room) into the
private apartments of Mademoiselle Beaujoie.
Martha Dowling, of course, followed her, and expressed much con-
cern for her malady, oflering all the specifics usually suggested by
one lady to another, under such circumstances.  No, thank you,''
was the reply she receied to all, `` I only want to get awsay.''
 But it will not be very easy to do so, this way,'' replied Martha,
 unless you will condescend to go through the passage that leads from
the offices.''
Never tfear, dear Marths,'' returned the self-willed young laly, t1
will condescend to go through any passage that will lead to fresh air,
for indeed that place was tao hot t''
The room they first entered on passing through the door, was one
dedicated to the reception of globes, slates, guitars, dumb bells, dic-
tionaries, embroidering-frames, and sundry other miscellanies con-
nected with an enlarged system of education. Beyond this was the
bedchamber of Mademoiselle, which again led to an apartment
opening upon that part of the school-room now occupied as the stage.
This room, whicl was denominated Mademoiselle Beaujoie's parlour,
was now converted into a general green-rom and dressing-room, for
into this, all exits from the stage were made.
While still in the bedroom, Miss Brotherton, and her more than
half-frightened companion, heard voices speaking in no very pleasant
accents from this theatrical retreat, and the angry tones of Sir MIatthew
Dowling himself were soon unmistakably audible.
ILet us go back, pray let us go back!'' said the greatly distressed
Martha, in a whisper.

mained lost in no very pleasing revery. But hardly had her medi-
tations lastcd a moment, ere thtey were chased by hearing the sound
of some one falling near her, and looking round, she perceied poor
Mlartha stretched insensible upon the flaor.
Inexpressibly shocked at remembering, which she did by no slow
action of the mind, the suffering to which her own unscrupulous curi-
osity had exposel the unfortunate girl, she ran to her with eager haste,
and with much repentant tenderness raised her head and did all her
smnall experienee suggested towards restoring her. The comfortable
insensibility did not last long: and Martha, who with restored ani-
mation immediately recovered her recollection, and in whose com-
position no affectation of any kind had part, raised herself without
assistance from the ground, and silently placed herself upon a sofa.
 Dear excellent MarthalI'' exclaimed MIiss Brotherton, with much
true feeling, `` fear not that I should ever repeat what I have so acci-
dentailly heard; and let not your good and dutiful nature sufer thus,
because I hae heard it. WVe have all our faults, Martha, and it is
the duty of each to pray for the conversion of their own hearts first,
and then for the repentance of others. And what prayers, dear girl,
so likely to be heard, as those of a good and dutiful child? Let us
slip back to our places, Martha. This clapping of hands announces,
as I take it, the conclusion of the piece,''
Martha, though wounded to the very soul, uttered no word of de-
precation or complaint: but there was an unsophisticated simplicity of
character about her which made her decline, by a courtesy that had a
little of the stiffness of ceremony in it, the offered arm of Mary,
anl stepping forward she opened the door by which they had left the
theatre, till the heiress had passed through it, and resumed her
place.

the first to awaken the femle heart to strong emotion seemed to be
totally powerless to her. She had never yet felt the slightest approach
to the passion of love; nor was it very likely she should, for one
amnong her many peculiarities of character was the persuasion that
every man who paid her attention was in pursuit of her fortune, an
idea, which to such a temper as hers was calculated to act as a
sevenfold shield against all amatory attacks unon her heart.
Most truly therefore, up to this time, had she continued
In mailen meditation, fancy ftree''
But this could be said no longer; neither fancy nor any other faculty
could be termed free in one whose thoughts fixed themselves by night
and day upon one single subject, while feeling that to it she was ready
to sacrifice every thing clse in life.
On re-entering her house on the memorable night of the Dowling
Lodge theatricals, Mliss Brotherton retired to haer apartment without
even the intention of sleeping. She laid her head upn her pillow
deliberately determined uot to close her eyes in sleep till she had
male up her mind as to the best way of reseuiag the pale trembling
child, whose voice and form haunted her, from the horrible bondage
of Sir Matthew Dowling's charity.
Thc question was not altogether an easy one. She could hardly
doubt that very strong indignation would follow any open effort on
her part to interfere with a child publicly held up as the favoured
object of Sir Matthew's loudly-vaunted benevolence, and moreoer,
privately marked out by his vindictive nature as a vietim to his
hatrel.
WYhether as a rival in his munificence, or a champion against his
hate, it was pretty certain that her interferencc would render henr
oboxious to her pompous neighbour's displeasure, and this she had
no inclination to encounter if she could help it. For though at this
moment she felt within her a strength and firmness of purpose not
easily shaken, the poor girl knew that she stood alone in the world,
with no friend to support her more powerful than nurse Tremlett, and
nothing but her two hundred thousand pounds' worth of this world's
trumpery to enable her to have her way, and hcer will, in many matters
tlat she feared might turn out rather difficult to manage.
So she determined to aoid quarrelling with Sir Matthew Dowling
slong as she could, and though the image of Michael struggling with
his tears, and the plaiutive sound of his oice as he pleaded for leave
to labour again, absolutely hannted her memory, she determined upon
being cautious, wise, and very deliberative in any measures she might
eventually take to ensure his release.
Under the influence of these prudential resolutions, Miss Bro-
therton for the present abandoned her purpose of seeking a convcr-
sation with the child himself, and determined to find her way to the
cottage of his mother instead. Yet esen this she felt must bc dlone
with caution. IHer carriage and her liveries were about as splendid

articles useful to man, without rendering those employel upon it unfit
to associate with the rest of thcir fellow-creaturest Ihis seems to
me so gross an absurdity that I cunnot give faith to it, and therefore
I suspect that the depravity and wickedness you anl Miss MIartha
Dowling talk about, must arise from these people having too much
money at their command. This, perhaps, may lead to intemperance
and extravagance. Don't you think this may be the case, Mrs.
Temlett 2'
Gool gracious, no, Miss Mary1 Why they are all the very
poorest starving wretches upon earth,''
 But they may be poor because they are extravagant, nurse. They
must get a most monstrous quantity of money, for though none of the
gentlemen ever talk much of their factories, I have repeatedly heard
allusion made to the enormous sums paid every week to the work-
people. And it is quite clear that all the families must get a great
deal, because all the little children work, which can hardly be the case
elsewhere. Now, I cannot help thinking, nurse, that a great del of
good might be done by teaching them a little economy, and inducing
them to lay by their superfluous money in a savings-bank. That is one
great reason why I want to get acquainted with the people themselves.
Now, for instance, that poor sick widow Armstrong-the mother of
the little boy that Sir Matthew Dowling has taken; 1 am quite sure
that she can have no wickedness to hurt me-and I am determined,
urse, to go and call upon her.''
 Well, my dear, that can't do no great harm, certainly: and, if
you like it, I can go in the carriage with you.''
:eMost certainly I should like you to go with me, but not in the
carriage, Mrs. Tremlett. I don't want to have all the people in her
neighbourhood staring at me, or at her either; and that tley would be
surc to do if we ent in the carriage. I mean to walk, nurse.''
 Do you know where the woman lives, my dear?''
: No; I must leave you to find that out,''
What is her name, Miss Mary ?''
"? Armstrong. She is a widow, and lives somewhere in Ashleigh.
Let us walk into the garden, and while 1 am looking after my seed-
lings, you can inquire of one of the under-gardeners, or the boy.
And if you manage the matter well, the next prime blossom that lI get
from my experiment-bed, shall be called the Tremlett geranium.''
Whle this conversation was going on at Millford Park, the residence
of Mss Brotherton, Dr. Crockley arrived to enjoy a site-d-ttte break-
fast with Sir Matthew in ` the study'' at Dowling Lodge. This room,
though not so splendid as some of its neighbours under the same roof,
could, nevertheless, he made very snug and comfortable upon occa-
sion, anl an excellent breakfast was spread before them; while the
two gentlemen sat in judgent upon little Michael's contumacy, and
consulted on the best method of bringing him into bettcr order.
 Confound the impt'' exclaimed 5ir Matthew, as he selected his

favourite dainties, `` is it not prooking, Crockley, that I should have
taken such an aversion to him? Upon my soul, I never hated any
tling so much in my life. In the first place it is disgusting to sce
him dressed up, walking about the house like a tame monkey, when I
know that his long fingers might be piercing thousands of threads for
two shillings a week;: and it is neither more nor less than loathsome
to see him eat, at luncheon, sometimes when we have had him in be-
fore company, exactly the very same things that my children eat
themselves; and then upon the back of it all, to know that the un-
grateful little viper hates the very sight of me. I don't believe,
Crockley, that any good can come of all this, equal to what it makes
me sufler in the doing. It is perfectly unnatural to see him elose
within an inch of my awn legs. I'd rather have a tame toad crawling
about by half. I must give it up, Crockley-I must, upon my sonl.''
You are the master, Sir Matthews. I can't stop you, if do it you
will: but I can tell you this, I have been calling at fifty different
houses, at the very lceast,' sincethis jobbegan, and I pledge you mysaered
honour that in every onc of them the only thing talked of was your
benevolence and geuerosity. Such an example?' oried one; ` So
heavenly-minted1' said another; ` It is enough to bring a blessing
pon the whole country,' whined a third; and, ` It is to be hoped that
such gcodness will be rewarded in this world and the next,' observed
a fourth. Think, Sir Matthew, how all this will tell against the
grumblings about Miss Nance Stephens and her sulden demisce.''
 That's trne-devilish true, Crockley-and yet it's no cure for my
being sick at the stomach every time I see him,''
'I don't now about that; I should think it was, or, at any rate,
if ou'll only bear it a little longer I shonld not be at all surprised if
you werc to be rclieved by some other great capitalist setting up in the
same way, and as your name has been sung out, that would do just
nas well. Upon my soul, l'm in earnest; I should not the least
wonder it, becfore the end of three months, every one of your first-rates
were to have a tame factory-child in their houses, to act like the
hedgehogs we get to eat hlack-beetles for us. And they'd do their
work well too, Sir MIatthew: all the nasty, creeping, multiplying
plagues, in the shape of cvil tales against the factory system, would
e swallowved up by the clearing-off effects of these nice little hedge-
hog gentsy.''
`` You are as keen as your own lancet, Crockley; and I never turn
a deaf ear to any thing you say. But it's monstrous hard though, that
I can't walk about my own house without running the risk of seeing
this odious little grub. DBy the way, Crockley, why could not my lady
take a factory-girl in by way of eharity? Some of the little wenches
are sightly enough before they hase worked down their flesh too far;
and, thongh I can't say I am particularly tender over the luanky idiot
looking slatterns that we mostly get at thie mill, I'llbhet what you please
that I should never hate the sight of a girl, as I do the sight of this

moderately.  But what would my lady say? And what would all
the other ladies say? No, no, leave that alone, and make up yaur
mind to let the boy hase the run of the house for a month or two;
after which you may send him to the devil if you will; for the gooi
will be done, and the boy himself forgotten.''
t That's all vastly easy for you to lay down, chapter anl verse,
wise man that you are,'' replied the knight. ` But if I tell all, I can
let you into a secret, Crockley, that would make you change your
min. perhaps. The long anl the short of it is, that I cnan't kecp my
ands off himn, and if thc young black-hearted scamp-I know he ii
black-hearted, I'm quite sure of it on account of a look he has got
with his eyes, that makes one always feel so uncomfortable-if ho
were to take it into his ile ungrateful head to go about the country
telling every thing that I may have happened to say and do to him,
When his nasty ways have pushed me further than lI could bear, I don't
think the history ol the charity job would do much good, doctor.''
Doctor Crockley gae a long low whistle; and then, aftera
inute's meditation, sail, : Tha's a bore.''
I know it is,'' sharply responded his patron, `` a devilish bore.
But you don't suppose thai I am to stand bursting with rage, and not
take he liberty of speaking my mind to a factory grub, do you?'
` Hcaven forbid . A whole factory full of wenches may all drop down
dead, I hope, hefore it comes to that,'' replied his friend.  But
what you have stated is worth attention, Sir Matthew. I don't like
the notion of that child's having tales to tell. It spoils all,''
1 know it,'' returned the vexed knight.  MIartha told me just
now, notr ten minutes before you came, that Miss Irotherton said she
should like very much to talk to the boy: she is as sharp as a needle,
you know, and Ill answer for it would find out all he has got to tell,
and a devilish deal more, perhaps, in no time. Pretty work that
would makel would it not Augustusis sure of her, he tells me; and
just faney such a match as that spoiled by the forked tongue of tlia
little viper1 The very notion makes one mad.''
`` A cure must be found for that mischief, let it cost what it may,''
replied Crockley; `` and for the future it might be better, perhaps, for
your charity, Sir Matthew, to show itself some other way. You are
too honest-hearted, that's the fact. A fine bold intellecti, like yours,
can't descend to the paltry patience belonging to inferior minds. Is
there no getting rid of the boy? No possibility of sending him 'pren-
tice some where or othoer ?''
'Prentice?'' said Sir Matthew, looking with a very singular ex-
pression into the face of his friend.  Prentice?'' he repeated,
and stretching out his hand, he seized upon that of Doctor
Crockley, which he shook with extraordinary ardour. ` Send him
as a prentice: Upon my soul, Crockley, if you had laid down
five hundred pounds upon the table, I should not have cnsidered
it as of one half as much worth as that one word 'ncE. Yes,

gsrow rich, and hold his tongue2 But no, he got bit by some poisonous
humanity notion or other, and a devilish shake he gae to thie system
jst at first, y his absurd bill for the protection of infant paupers; bu:
such men as Sharpton are not to be knocked down like ninepins,
either by law-makers, or law; and to say the truth, old Sir Robert
Peel's bill was to all intents and purposes a dead letter within
two years after it was passed. DBless your soul, it was the easiest
thing in the world to keep the creatures so ignorant about the bill,
after the first talk was over, that they might hae been madeto believe
any thing anl to submit to any thing. In fact the question for them
always lies in an egg-shell, They must either do what the masters
would have them, on srany. That fact is worth all the bills that
ever were passed: and another thing is, that as long as there's
nothing to prevent our own friends and relations from being among
the magistrates, even if complaints are made, we can manage them.''
Iow true it is, Sir Matthow, that there is no inequality of acci-
dental condition than can equal the inequality produced by a decided
superiority in the intellectual powers,'' said Dr. Crockley. ` At this
moment I give you my sacred honour that I look upon you, and your
friend Mr, Elgood Sharpton also, as standing in a much more com-
manding position than any duke in the country. Whats a long
descent comnpared to a long head, Sir Matthew? Ill tell you what
the dilference is. A Iong descent pretty generally helps a man to
empty his purse, wvhereas a long head will nesrer fail to help him fll
it. It is as clear to me, as that the sun's in heaven, Sir Matthew,
that the game is in your own hands. I know-for I have made some
curious experiments that way-I know what a dog may be taught to
do by hunger, and yo may rely upon it that it is just as powerful in
a man. Egad, Bir Matthew, it is a very fine subject for scientific
experiments. It is difficult to say how far it might go. If a dog, for
example, may be taught tricks by unger, that approach in ingenuity
to the powers of man, why may not man, skilfully acted upon by the
same principle, be brought to rival the docility of a dog l''
I see nothing in nature to stop it, doctor,'' replie Sir Matthew,
with an air of great animation.   But remember, my dear Crockley,
this is not a point to be touched upon in the book we were talking of.
Thoe public, you know, can have nothing on earth to do with the
private regulation of our affairs. People havse just as much right to
inquie at what o'clock my lord uke expects his valet to get up, and
moreover what the valet eats for brenkfast when he is up, as thcyhave
to know what hours our hired labourers keep, and what they feed
upon. It is a gross inquisitorial interference, Croeckley, and ought
not to be thought of in n fee country.'
 That's a tirst-rate idea though, Sir Matthew,'' said the doctor,
taking out his packet-book and pencil. 1 must book that. It is
turning the parliament into an office of the inquisition. The canters
may call it a loly ofice, if they will, but the British people will neer
bear the notion of aw NIsToN. That's a capital idea, I promise

Crockley rose too; but, though he took up his hat and his riding-
whip from the chair on which he had placed them, he lingered as if
he had still something to say before he took his leave.
Sir Mtthew, howeer, seemed to take no notice of the hint, but
steteiog outlis hand said deceisively, `Good morning, deetor, good
morning. Let us see you again soon,''
D. CGrockley upon this tretched out his hand too, but instead of
elutching that of the knight, he seized upon his button. `'One word,
Sir Matthew, one word. You are too much of a man of business to
think me troublesome. Respecting that little appointment that you
ware talking about the other day; I should like to have it settled.
Because, to say the truth, I shall consider myself as wearing your
livery;: or, to speak more fitly, to be fighting positively under you
colours, when this is done; and of course you knaow we ought to
understand one another completely,''
No doubt of it, Crockley. I said nothing that I do not mean to
stand to. Yon shall have two hundred a year, paid quarterly, for
attending to the health and wellbeing, and all that, you know, of the
factory children. But as I don't want you to give them two hundred
pounds' worth of physie, rememher I shall expect that you will make
up the deficiency in-in just saying round about the neighbourhaod
how remarkably well every thing goes on at Brookford Factory. IIl
pledge you my word that every thing does go on capitally well there,
Crockley, so you will have nothing on yonr conscience on that
score''
'1 am not afraid of that, Sir Matthew; I know I may trust you.
DBut I should like a bit of a memorandum about my own business, if
you please.''
Quite right, quite right, sir. I am too much a man of business
to object to that. Draw up the engagement, such as you wish it to
be, and I dare say I shall make no objection to signing it.''
After this a corial hand-shaking was exchangel and tle friends
parted.

A UFOTNATE ECOXTRE-AN ADVETRE-MISS BROTHIEnRTON
GOws WIEI ERY DAY.
Mns. TnELETs inquiries proved suecessful. Jim Sykes, the
weeding-boy. knew perfectly well where widow Armstrong lived: and
after he had repeatled his instructions three times, hMary Brotherton
and her unresisting chaperon set off on their expedition. On one
124
TIE LIFE AND ADVENTIRES
point only did the self-willed heiress yield to the judgment of her com-
panion. MIary, who knew, that though she seldom went heyond the
shelter of her own park-paling, she often walked without fatiguc
within it for two or three hours together, wished toset off for Hoxley-
lane on foot; but Mrs. Tremlett talked so much of the fatigue, that
the good-natured girl consented to let the carriage convey them to the
poiut ut which the lane divergel from the high-road. This yielding,
however, was wholly from consideration for her companion. For
herself she believed the precaution quite needless; and she was right.
Howeer much her temper might have been cndangered by the series
of spoiling processes she hadl undergone, her health had been taken
good care of, and few girls of her age in any rank, had geater power
and will for exertion than herself.
Nevertheless, before she had driven half a mile, she heartily rejoiced
at having sacrificed her own inclination to that of her good nurse; for
the road o Ashleigh was the faourite ride of the officers quartered in
the neighbourhood, and had she been seen on foot, it is probable
that before reaching Hoxley-lane she would have been surrounded by
a body-guard of military. So greatly did this danger appal her
tspirits, that the first moment she found herself free from a white-
gloved hand either at one window or the other, she stopped the car-
riage, and ordered the coachman to go far enough down the lane
to permit her to get out unobserved by any persons passing by the
road.
But poor Mlary was this day doomed to disappointment; and the
indignant, and almost passionate bcating of her heart under it, made
her more conscious, perbaps, than she had ever been before, bow deeply
the business upon which she was engaged had entered into her soul.
Soon after Sir Matthew Dowling had dismissed his breakfast com-
panion, he strolled out towards his splendid stales, and perceiving
his son loitering among the grooms, and himself equipped for the
saddle, he inquiredl whither he was going to ride, : Only to Ashleigh,
goternor,'' was the reply.  Then wait five minutes, Augustus, and
I will ride with you.''
Whether the youth approved the proposal or not, he was fain to
submit to it, and the evil star of Mlary bBrotherton contrived to bring
them to the top of Hoxley-lane at the moment her carriage was about
to turn into it.
 Stopl'' cried the young lady, accompanying the word with a very
energetic pull at the check-string.  Go on to Ashleigh,'' was the
order that followed.
 WVas ever any thing so provoking, nurse? Do you see who those
hateful men are 2''
 WVhy 'tis Sir Matthew, my dear,'' repliel the gentle old woman.
e The wretchl'' muttered Mary between her teeth at the very
moment tht Sir MIatthew on one side, and his languishing son on the
other, besieged her carriage.
Not for my right hand would l have him guess where I am going,''

thought she, as with a face suflusel with the deepest carmine that
agitation could produce, she iforced her lips into an unmeaning smile
in return to their salutation.
The father and son came to exactly the same conclusion, and at the
same moment. There was but one cause that it was possible to assign
for her evident emotion. She was deeply in love with Augustus,-more
deeply than even the young man himself hal imagined. The thing
was plain, no doubt remained, no not a shadow of it on the mind of
either father or son, but it was the elder gentleman only who at once
determined to push so fine a game to its close, with as little lelay as
possible.
Feeling quite sure that there was no liberty he could take at this
moment which would not he welcome, he made a sign to the coach-
man to stop, and deliberately lismounting he threw his reins to his
groom, toll Miss Brotherton's footman to open the carriage-door, and
stepped in with the assumed air of a partially loved friend, who knows
that no leave ncel be asked.
MIary shrunk back into her corner with considerably more disgust
than if a reptile had possessed itself of the seat opposite.
 This is not quite as it should be, is it?'' aid Sir Matthew, with
aleer.  Perhaps some other may have a better right here than I ?
And a very expressive smile accompanied the words.
 Sir2'' said Miss Brotherton.
Come, come, my dear child, you must not look vexed at any of
my little jokes. You know how we all dote upon you1 Dear creaturel
How beautiful that sweet blush makes you look He, he: there goes
poor Augustus looking very much as if he could wring hs papa's neck
off. But his turn, we will hope, may come by and by. And now,
my dear, I'll toell yon what I am come here for. We all want you,
and your good MIrs. Tremlett too, if she likes it, to come over to us
quite en fumille to-morrow. I don't know what love-powder you have
been scattering amongst us, but there is not a single individual of the
family wlho does not positirely dote upon you. Tell me, my psetty
MIary, do you fcel a little kindness for some of us in return ?''
An attempt to take her hand accompanied this speech; and Mrs.
Tremlett, wbo estimated pretty nealy her young lady's afection for
Sir Matthew and his race, actually trembled for the consequences.
But, to her great surprise, MIary answered, after the pause of a mi-
nute, `Oh, dear Sir Mlatthewl you are only laughiag at me:'' in a
voice so exceedingly childish and silly, that it might, under similan
circumstances, have made the fortune of a comic actress; and though
she did not permit him to touch the hand he attempted to take, she
placed it, together with its fellow, so playfully behind her, that Sir
Mlathew could only laugh and call ler, '`dear pretty creaturel''
Meanhile the carriage proceeded to penetrite through the dimty
dismal streets, which, in that direction, formed the suburb of sh-
leigh.
1 must get out here,'' said Miss Brotherton, suddenly pulling the
check-string.

who could tell if fraud and drunkenness might not enter the moment
after, to complete the group 
But there was little of selfishness and much of courage in the heart
of Mary Drotherton, so she presently forgot eery notion of personal
danger, and was thus enabled to see things as they really were.
On one side of the small bare chamber, and in some degree shel-
tered by the door which opened against it, stool a rickety machine
once intended for a bedstead. Two of the legs had given place to
brickbats, and instead of a bed the unsteady frame now supported
only a thin layer of very dirty straw, with the body of a dying female
stretched upon it. The only other article of furniture in the room was
an old deal box without a cover, but having a couple of planks, each
about three feet long, laid across it; serving either for table or chairs
as occasion might require. The walls, the floor, the ceiling, and the
remnant of a window, were all alike begrimed with smoke and
din.
It took not long to make this inventory, and having completed it,
the yung laly, still holding in each hand a staring child, turnoed
towards the inhabitant of this miserable den, and said,
 Are you ill, my good woman 2''
The being she addressed raised her heavy eyes, and in a voice so
low as to be scarcely intelligible, answered  Yes,''
'Have you no assistance, nobody to nurse you ?''
 Noody but these,'' pointing to the children.
Has any doctor seen her ?'' demanded Mary of the eldest child.
 No ma'am,'' replied the little girl.
And how long has she been il?'
e ver since she com'd from the mill,''
And how long is that?''
A twelvemonth,'' said the little one.
I don't know,'' said the eldcr.
tBut, my poor children, you are not the only people that live with
her, I suppose? Have yo got any father ?''
 Yes.''
e Vhere is he 2
At the mill''
Have yon got any body else belonging to you?'' said Miss Bro-
therton, shuddering.
There's Sophy, and Dick, and Grace,'' replied the eldest child.
 WVhere are they allt'' again inquired Miss Brotherton.
:At the mill,'' was again the answer.
Are Sophy and Grace grown up?''
Sophy is,'' answered the child, `` and Grace, almost.''
 Then why do they not stay at home, one of them at least, to take
care of this poor woman ?''
'Cause they mustn't. I 'tends mother.''
You are not big enough totake care of her, my poor child. Why
don't you go to the factory, and let one of the bigger oues stay at
home72''
128
TE LIE AND ADVEATIUREs
e They won't have me now, 'cause of this.'-And as she spake, the
child held up a litle shrivelled right-hand, three fingers of which
had a joint deficient. :I can't piece now, and so they won't let me
come.''
 And Sophy won't let me go, 'cause of this,'' said the little one,
slipping her arm out of a bedgown (wlich was the only garment she
had), and displaying the limb swollen and discoloured, from some
violent contusion.
:My poor little creature how did you do this7' said Miary,
tenderly, taking the little hand in hers, and examiniug the frightful
bruise.
 Twas the billy-roller,'' ssid the little girl, in an accent that
seemed to insinuate that the young lady was more than commonly dull
of apprehension.
 But how did it happen, my child? Did some part of the ma-
chinery go over you?'
No1-That was me,'' criod the elder, with a loud oice, and
again holding up her demolished fingers. ee Twas the stretcher's
billy-roller as smashed Becky.''
 Tas, cause I was sleepy,'' said the little one, beginning to ery,
for she construed Mary's puzzled look into an expression of dis-
pleasure.
 They beats 'em dreadful ma'am,'' said the sick woman, evidently
exerting herself beyond her strength. : She's a good little girl for
work; but they will fall asleep, all of 'em at times, when they be
kept so dreadful long''
But these bruises could not be the effect of heating,'' said Mary,
again examining the arm,  i is quite impossible.'
 WVhy, ma'am, the billy-roller as they beats 'em with, is a stick big
enough to kill with; and many and many is the baby that has been
crippled by it.''
There was something so hollow, so sunken in the woman's voice,
that Miss Brotherton felt terrified. The fact that a child of the size
of the baby before her should have bcen beaten with such a weapon,
and with such violence, seemed wholly ineredible. Again she thought
of Sir Matthew Dowling's warning, and wished that she were not
alone.
 I am alfraid that you are very ill,'' said she, `` and I know not how
I can help you. Money I can give, but there is nobody here to make
use of it for you.''
 Money:'' murmured the sinking woman from her layer of straw.
Money, ye sen give monuey? Ohl give it, give it. Gise it to her-
give it to the child; she knows what it is, she knows I am dying for the
want of it. It is too late for me but gise it, give it, and may God-''
 HIere the miserable creature's strength wholly failed; her eyes
closed, and to all appearance, she was already a corpse.
OhI this is very dreadfult'' cried poor Mlary, wripging her hands,
`nurse will know better than me,'' and so saying, she turued engerly
towards the door.
OR IICHAEL AIMISTROG.
129
'She be gone, mother, and haven't givred nothing,'' said the eldest
grl, in a voice so mournfully expressive of disappointment, that, spite
of her alarm, Mlary stopped to take half-a-crown from her purse, which
she put into the child's hand.
She looked at the coin, and in a half-whisper ejaculated, : O '
Then creeping to the bed, she put it into the palm of her mother's
hand, pressing the fingers down upon it, and in an accent of inter-
rogation uttered the word ` Bread ?''
This Mary heard,but not the answer to it, for she had quitted the
scene before it was uttered. On opening the door of the house, she
started at seeing Sir Matthew Dowling still within a dozen yarls of it;
he was standing besile the carriage, with one arm extended to keep
the door of it open, and the other resting against the vehicle on the
opposite side of the opening, while his head thrust forward within an
inch of good Mrs, Tremlett's nose effectually prevented her following
her young lady, however much she might have wished to do so. lle
had, indeed, upon Miss Drotherton's disappearance reseated the good
woman almost by force, and then addressed her in such a strain as
wvas rapidly working her up to make an attempt to escape from the
other side of the carriage, when the reappearanee of the young lady
released her from her thraldom,
Mrs, Tremlettt'' he said,'' are you aware of the awful respon-
sibilits vhich will rest upon you if any thing unfortnnate happens to
your amiable, but most headstrong young lady All the neigh-
bourhood know, Mlrs. Tremlett, that she has, as it were, placed herself
for protection in your hands, refusing all other counsel, and shutting
her ears to all other advice, and it is thus that you perform your
duty:''
Gool God, sir what do you mean?'' said the good woman, in
great agitation. ` Let me out if you please, sir. If my young lady is
in any danger, it is wicked to keep me sitting here. Let me out,
sir ''
1 wiIl let you out, Mrs. Temlett,'' replied the knight, still firmly
retaining the position wvhich so effectually kept her in, ''1 will let you
out; but first, for her sake and your own, it is my duty to tell you in a
few words the sort, of place she has now thought proper to enter.
Don't struggle, Mrs. Tremlett, but hear me. It is not possible they
can do her any personal injury as long as l am so near the door of the
house as at present. Be ery sure that from some hole or corner of
the fllthy premises, some spyig eyes are at this moment watching us.
There is no danger of her being murdered now, but as sure as you sit
there, Mrs. Tremlett, murdered she will be, if she goes without the
protection of a powerful arm within such des of sin and iniquity as
she has entered now. One short moment more, Mrs. Tremlett-one
short moment, while I tell what the creatures are among whom she has
thrown herself. The house is notorious as one of the very worst in
Ashleigh. The man is an habitual drunkard, whom I, and my ex-
cellent servant Parsons, have endeavoured in every possible way to
reform-but in vain. The moment he has got his wages, he goes to

possible to say whether there may not be something deleterious, some-
thing noxious, in short, to your very precious health in the atmosphere
of this room.'
I thank you, sir. Be sure I will take quite sufficient care of myself;
but it is not for me that your services are wanted-it is herol''
Bophy, the eldest girl seemed unconscious of what was geing on,
for she remaine perfectly motionless on the spot where she had first
knelt down; while the third sister, who had been sent on the poor
mother's last errand for bread, and who had crept back unobserved into
the room during the foregoing seene, oecupiodi the space on her right
hand, Mary Brotherton haring knelt on her left, so that there was
scarcely space for the approach of the smart apothecary.
 Move, my dear girls:'' said Mary, gently layig a hand on the
shoulder of each.
They both rose; while Mr, Thomas, carefully storing the anecdote
in aid of the gossiping part of his practice, looked and listened with
astonishment to what seemed to him the very unnatural conduct of the
rich young lady, and iuteraally exclaimed, `` A clear case of religious
mania this, as I over saw1 She won't live long, probably. What a
match 1''
It required no very long examination of the poor patient, to discover
that her last moment was rapidly approaching
Jpon my word, Miss Bratherton, I really wish I could persuade
you to come away,'' persisted the medical gentleman as he once more
turned towards her. The air is becoming more mephitic every instant.
e This woman is at the last extremity.''
 Nothing, then, can be done for her?'' said Mary,
 No, ma'am-nothing in the world. Not the whole college, if they
were present, could keep soul and body togelher for another hour, I
would venture to say,''
On this Miss Brotherton put a fee into his hand, and bent her head
in token that his business there was ended, and that he might depart.
But he did not immeliately obey the hint, for pocketing the unwonted
golden prize, he seemed anxious to remain a little longer where such
blossings aboundedl, and retusing to the bed, again took hold of the
poor woman's hand, and then said in a voice of authority-'` Let me
have some water.''
It was Nary only who seemed to understand his words, and she
immediately obeyed them, placing in his hand the broken mug which
she had set aside upon the floor. The apothecary put the water to tho
lips of the poor woman, and she again swallowed a little of it, after
which they saw her lips moe as if she was making an effort to speak
to them.
MIm. Tremlett lent over her, and then, with a stronger effort he
articulatel- Let mo see WilliamlI'
e who is William ?'' said Mrs. Tremlett raisiag herselt, ` Is it one
of the children 2
 Itbe father,'' said Botsy.

THE LIE AND ADVTURES
WVhere is he to be found ?'' criel Miss Brotherton, eagerly. ``Let
him be sovght for instantly-where is he likely to he2'
..' At the gin-shop,'' replied the ungracions Grace.
If you know where he is, go for him,'' said MIary, impressively,
`and for God's sake let him not delay I''
The girl she addressed stared at her as upon something utterly in-
comprehensible: bnt she obeyed, and, in so short a time'as to sho
that thc gin-shop was at no great distance, returned with a man of an
cxterior as  filthy as the rest of his race, wretchedly crippled in the
legs, and a complexion that spoke both of ill health, and intemperance.
. Whatl-lt is come to that, is it,already ?'' said the man looking
wistfully.at her from the bottom of the bed, but with a countenanee
whosc lines seemed too fixed in the expression of hard indifference, to
permit its exhibiting much feeling-
She asked for you, father,'' said Sophy gently, then taking one of
her mother's hands in hers she murmured, `` Mlother -Dear motherl
-open your eyes upon us, father is here, and all of us,'' while large
tear-drops fell upon the livid face as she hung over it.
The dying eyes were once ore opened, and consciousness, and
recognition of them all, were visible as she suflered them to rest first
on one, and then on another. The boy only, fron his position, she
could not see ; but even then, there seemed intelligence between them,
and she certainly knew he was lying ' beside her, for her head rested
against his, and she raised her left hand till her fingets touehed his
cheek. The youngest child also when the mother's eyes opened, was
too nuch behind her, but she seemed aware of her vicinity, and pro-
nounced the words ``Little one1'' probably her usual appellation, ss
distinctly as to make the child start, and instantly climb upon the bed
to kiss her. The last moveinent was an effort to return this kiss; and
the next moment Mrs. Tremlett rcemoved the child's clinging lips from
a cDTSe.
A very awful interral of perfect stillness followel. Can I be of
any further service to you, Miss Brotherton ?'' from the lips of Mr.
Thomas, were the first words that broke it.
Poor Mary only shook her head, hut MIrs. Tremlett replied, : No,
thank you sir, nothing more;'' and with repeated bows, and rathera re-
luctant step, he dcparted: turning, hiowever, to give another glance at
the heiress, as he passed out, for he was not without hopes that she
mighit fall down in a fuinting-fit. Nothing, however, of the kind hap-
pened, and he disappeared..
' Yon will go now, Mary dear:'' whispered MIns. Temlett,'andI
willL come here.to-morrow to inquire about them for you.''
Yes, I will go now,'' replied the young lady, .I cannot comfort
them.'' Then looking round upon the steadfast group, as if to dis-
cover,xhich of them appeated in the fittest state to be spoken to, she
fixed upon the little l3etsy, and placing a couple of sovereigns in her
hand, told her, to, take care .of them, and gie them to her father

She then led the way to her carriage, Mr. ITremlett followed, and
the next moment they were driving rapidly from the abode of the most
abject misery, to a residence which every quarter of the globe had con-
tributed to render luxnrious.
lt was evident that the heiress felt no inelination to converse;
indeed, for by far the greater portion of the way her face was con-
cealel by the handkerchief which she held to her eyes, and Mrs.
Tremlett had too much real feeling to disturb her. After dtiving,
however, through the handsome lodge-gates, and sweeping tup to the
noble entrance of her mansion, where already, at the sound of her
Approaching carriage, two or three servants were seen waiting like a
guarl of honour to receive her, it seemed that her meditations had
not been wholly confined to the deathbed scene she had witnessed,
anl that the sordil cabin, with its misery-stampel inhabitants, had
made a deep impression ; for the first, and for many hours the only
words she uttered after her return, spoken to the ear of Mre, Tremlett
as they walked arm in arm together through the hall, were these:
I too am living by the profit of the factory house. Is the division
just ?-Oh, GodI Is it holy 2''
The old woman felt that she trembled violently, but knew not what
words to utter that might compose her,
On arriving at the foot of the sairs, Mary withdrew her arm, and
mounting the more rapidly than her companion could follow, reached
her bedchamber alone, which she entered, closing and bolting the
door after her.

Ir will be easily believed that Sir MIatthew rode back to Dowling
Lodge not in the very sweetest hmour in the world. : Bring u A
child in the way he should go,'' is an admirable proverb, and certain
it is that when that ` way'' is agreeable, he does vrery rarely `` depart
from he same.'' Thus it happens that the young gentlemen and ladies,
sons and daughters of the millocrats, who pile thousands pon thou-
sands, and acres upon acres, by the secret imnysteries of their wonderful
compound of human and divine machinery, lo rarely or never take their
way into the dwellings that shelter and that hide the sufferings of their
operatives. Nothing is so distasteful to a truly elegant mill-owner as

 There's none but 'prentices taken in at the mill in the deep hollow,
Sir Matthew, if you mean that.''
Yes, sir, I do mean that,'' replied Sir Matthew with a very
ominons frown,  and there Master Michael Armstrong shall go, 'pren-
tice or no 'prentice, or I'll give him up my place, and take his.''
 That's all, then Sir Matthew,'' said the overlookser, preparing t
depart. I com'd to put you up to the boys ingratitude, and have
nothing further to say at present.''
 You need not trouble yourself any more about that, Mr. Parsons.
I will take care of him,'' replied the knight. Whereupon Mr. Parsons
made a bow, and departed.
Sir Mlatthew Dowling had already taken one tumbler of hock-and-
water. He now took a second, and then throwing himself back in his
arm-chair, indulged for several minutes in very deep meditation. At
the end of that time it seemed as if the good Rhiue wine had done its'
office, for suldenly the knight's countenance became animated; the
heavy gloom which had rested upon it disappeared, and springing to
his feet he rang the bell with a sart of lively jerk which showed he had
some project in hand that he greatly relished.
It was the lively Peggy who answered the summons; but though she
entered almnost out of breath from the eagerness with which she had
traversed the passage which led fromn the kitchen to the study, and
though she brought into immediate activity all the agaceries of which
she was capable, a smiling nod was all she got in return, so eager did
Sir Matthew appear to say, ` Go to Miss Martha, Peggy, as fast as you
can, and tell her to come here to me this very minute. Go, my dear,
and make haste, there's a good girl.''
Pegy was disappointed and angry, for she had a great deal to tell
Sir Miatthew about Michael Armstrong's ungratefulness, and all that
the servants thought and said about it; but the command she had
received was too peremptory to be trifled with, and though she very
nearly slammed the study door in shutting it, she failed not to delivet
her message, which was instantly obeyed with the most dutiful alacrity
by Miartha.
Did you send Peggy for me, paps ?'' said she in entering.
eYes, Martha dear, I did. How are yos t-day, my dear girl
I have not seen' you before this morning. Sit down, love, sit down;
I want to talk to you, Martha, I have got sometling upon my mind
that vexes me, and I am going to open my heart to you about it,''
 Oh, my dear, dear papa 1'' returned Martha, 'I should be so glad
if I could be of any use to you I''
 You can, Mlartha-you can be of great use and comfort to me.,
In the first place you must be my father confessor, and let me confess
my faulus to you, and I hope you will give me absolution if you can:
for lreally am very uncomfortable.''
e WVhat can you mean, papa ?''
 hy, my dear, I mean thatIhave been foolish enough to put my-
self in a great pet, when I ought not to hae done any such thing. It
is always wrong to let temper get the better of one; but in this case it

trees, the black tint of the loathsome factory seems to rest upon every
object near it. The walls are black, the fences are black, the win-
dow-panes (when there are any) are all veiled in black. No domestic
animal that pertinaciously exists within their tainted purlieus, but
wenrs the same dark hue; and perhaps there is no condition of
human life so significantly surrounded by types of its own wretched-
ness as this.
MIartha Dowling shuddered as she looked around her: anl when
Michael returned to lead her in, she felt half afraid of crossing the
gloomy threshold.
But the widow Armstrong was, as usual, less dirty in her abject
misery than, perhaps, any other inhabitant of Hoxley-lane, or its im-
mediate neighbourhood, and the mild countenance and gentle voice
with which she replied to the young laly's salutation removed all her
scruples, and she seated herself in the chair placed for her by Michael,
with the best disposition in th world to improve the acquaintance.
I hope yo are getting better, MIrs. Armstrong?'' said Martha, in
that tone of genuine female softness which it is so impossible to mis-
take, `` and that you don't miss little Michael as much as you did at
frst.'
 You are very kind, ma'am, to take the trouble of coming to such
a place as this,'' replied the poor woman, in a voice that indicated
something like surprise. Ipon which Michael, who had stationed
himself nenr enough to enable him to slip his little hand into hens,
said, with a tolerably expressive emphasis--` This is Miss Martha,
mother,''
I wish, ma'am, I had strength and power to thank you asI ought,
for all your condescending kindness to my poor boy?'' said the widow,
earnestly.I never see him, that he has not some fresh story to tell
me of your goodness to him. He can read a chapter in the Bible now
as well as any boy of his age neel to do. And oh. Miss-This is
all owing to you-for never could he have given his time to it in the
factory.''
 There is more praise due to him than to me, Mrs. Armstrong, l
assure you. He is a very good boy at learning, and minds every
word that is said to him. I suppose he has shown you his copy-book
too, hasn't he,? I never saw a child that had so good a notion of
writing.''
: He was ahlways a quick loy, Miss-but never can he be thankful
enough to you for teacbing him how to put his quickness to profit. It
ill e the making of him.''
I am very glad to hear you speak so earnestly about his learning,
because that makes me think that you will be pleased at hearing the
business I am come upon. ly papae, who is very''-here poor Martha
stopped short. She was going to add-` kind to little Michael,'
bnt her honest heart would not let her pronounce the words: so she
changed the phrse, and went on with ` very desirous of being really

if it is not a good plan. I mean to be the very best boy that ever my
master had, and when I've gone on working with him a bit, two or three
months, perhaps, mother,-time enough for him really to find out that
I am a good boy,--I will tell him all about you and Teddy, and make
him understand that if he wants to keep me in good heart to work, he
must let me trudge away home to pass a Sunday now and then with
you two. I dont think he'll be able to say no, mother, when I tell
him about Teddy's poor legs, and all you have done for us both, lying
a-bed here.''
Mrs. Armstong again kissed her boy, and after gaziag at him with
a look imwhich pride and pleasure were strangely blended with an-
guish, she sail, ``I do think you'll make your way, Michael-for
you are a good boy, a very good boy. But I don't know how poor
Edward will take it,''
That's the worst part of it, mother,'' replied the little fellow, be-
ginning to cry.  Poor Teddy does look so very happy of a night
when he sees me pop round the corner upon him, as he comes out of
the factory l-But tlen I shall be able to help him, mother, all the
better by and by. And when I come home of a Sunday, mother, I
must teach him to write, and then think how beautiful to have a letter
from one another1 I know who'll give me a slate for Teddy, and me
too, to lenrn with, and that's Mliss Martha. And I shan't mind asking
her, not the least, because she knows I am going away. And do you
know, mother, l've got another notion, and that's no bad comfort
neither. I should not a bit wonder, if Miss MIartha was to turn out a
right good friend to you and Teddy, when I am gone.''
And so the little fellow ran on-each hopeful word he uttered be-
getting a ne hope, till, by the time the hour of departure arrived, his
poor mother had at least the comfort of believing that the prospect
opening before him, was one that he looked upon with much less of
pain than pleasure.
MIeanwhile Martha found her way safely home, and gave her father
such an account of the result of her mission, as induced him to give
her a kiss, and declare that if she was not the handsomest of the
family, she was out-anl-out the most useful.

Ir was not till the second dinner-bell had rung, that Mrs. Tremlett
ventured to seek Mary in her chamber.
The worthy woman was perfectly aware that the naturally strong

feelings of her young mistress had been violently affected by the scene
they had witnessed, and though far perhaps from comprehending the
effeet it had produced on her mind, she was conscious that she should
do no good by obtruding herself uncalled-for upon her retirement.
But when the signal that always brought them together had passed
unheeded, she became uneasy, and availing herself of the privilege
that long and well-requited affection guve, she knocked at her door
and called upon her name.
Miss Brotherton answered the summons immediately; bnt her withi-
lrawing the bolt of her door, as well as the unchanged appearance of her
dress, showed that she had not been occupied in preparing for dinner.
 You are uot aware how late it is, my dear child. The second
dinner-bell has rung:'' said Mrs. Tremlett looking anxiously in her pale
face.
Has it ?'' replied the young lady;  indeed, I beg yer parlon-
bnt I will not keep you wvaiting, I will not dress to-day if you will ex-
cuse it''
 No, no, my dear, that won't do. Noever mind about the dinner
I ill tell them to take it out again.''
Inlced I do not wvish to drcss,'' said Mary languilly. Morgan
will tease me by asking what dress I choose to wear and fifty questions
besides. Let me go down as I am, nurse Tremlett.''
You shan't have Morgan at all dear. The dressing will refresh
you my darling child; and it won't be the first time Mary, that I have
done all that yout wanted in that way. There-just sit down on the
sofa for one minute, and I will speak about the dinner, and be back
again.''
It was very passively that Mary did as she was bid, and without
another word of remonstrance sat down and awaited the return of her
old friend. She was indeed completely exhausted, the scene she hal
witnessed had not touched only, it had wrung her heart; and the
hours she had passed since, were not such as to bring her spirits back
to their ordinary tone. It was not alone, the melancholy spectacle of
a fellow-creature passing from life to death, which had thus strongly
affected her-it was the frightful dlegradation of the group of human
beings vho had gazed upon it with her. It was the horrible recollec-
tion of the dying woman's statement respecting the lacerated flesh of
her child-and it was the filth, the misery, the famine, and the vice
that she had been warned of, and had seen, which had set her power-
ful, healthy, unprejudiced, and unselfish mind, to meditate upou the
state of things which had produced it.
It was hardly possible for any one to be more profoundly ignorant
upon the subjert which had thus seized upon her heart, than was
Mary Brotherton. On the question of negro slavery she had from
her very earliest infancy heard a great deal, for her father was an anti-
(black)-slavery man, who subscribed to the African society, anid the
missionary fund; drank Mt, Wilberforce's health after dinner when-
ever he had company at his table: and while his own mills daily sent
millions of groans to be registered in heaven from joyless young hearts

herself by the side of Miss Brotherton when the door agaia opened,
and Sophy Drake, leading a. little sister in each hand, enterel the
drawing-room.
It required no force of contrast to render the miserable, squalid,
unhealthy appearance of thcse poor girls most painfully striking; if it
had, the elegant apartment into which they now entered would have
furnished it  Mary's heart smote her as she gazed upon them.  Sa
young-a petty tool'' thought she, `` and yet so painful to look
upon 1''
The eldest of the three looked languid, weary, spirit-broken, and
inanimate, hardly throwing a glance at the novel ohjects around  her,
and looking more fit to lie down and rest the aching limbs she slowly
ragged along, than to indulge any feeling of curiosity: The little
ones had the same unsteady tired gait, but they looked up with an
cxpression of wonder, and almost of awe, on every object as they passed
along.''
How are you all, my poor girls?'' said Mary kindly, as they drew
near to her. The eldest girl dropped a courtesy but made no audible
reply.
It is so sad and hopeless a grief to lose a mother,'' continued Miss
DBrotherton, `` that I can say not one word to check your grief. DBut
if there is any thing that I can do to make you more comfortable, 1
shall be glad to do it. You seem all of you greatly in want of
clothes. How cones that, when so many of the family work, and get
wages2''
 The wages isnt enough to buy us breal, ma'am,'' replied the
eldest girl, and help pay ledging rent.
This statement seemed so very iucrelible, that Mary folt a painful
conviction that the young creature before her was not speaking truth.
fShe remained silent for a minute or two, and then said, ` I suppose
when you sy bread you mean ood of all kinds?-and tea, and sugar,
and buttcer, and so on?'' said Mary.
I have not had the taste of meat in my mouth for above these two
years,'' replied Sophy colouring, and in a voice that seemei to indi-
cate something like indignation-` and as to sugar in our tea, or butter
on our bread, no factory child is brought up to it''
.Mary coloured too. She longed to get accurate information re-
specting their manner of living, and the reasons why ineessant labour
failed to supply the necessaries of Iife ; but she knew not well how to
set about it.
 Do not e angry with me, Bophy,'' said she,  if I ask questions
that seem unfeeling and very ignorant. I really know little or nothing
about the manner in which poor people live, and I want to know. Not
merely from curiosity, but because I should like to help them if 1
could,'
`And Gol knows we want help bad enough, ma'am,'' replied the
girl, while tears started to her eyes. ` Father has got the money yo
gave yesterday, and we shall never hear any more of that.''
 Is he a bad father to you then ?'

 Not bal to beatus. But he drinks terrible,'
 Then I suppose his wagee ge partly ia that?'
 His wages, and our'n too, ma'am. He baint always able to
get work. The old hands are often out, and then in course he takes
our'n,''
` Then if he was a temperate, steady man, you would do a great
deal better'
 In course we should, ma'am. Dut mother said he took to it, as
most of the others do in all the mills, on account of hating to come
home so, when we young ones comes in from work. I have heard mother
say that father cried when I, that was the biggest, com'd home first
beaten and brulsed with the strap and the billy-roller.''
 WVhat is the billy-roller, Sophy'' inuired Miss Brotherton, in an
accent denoting considerable curiosity.
tIt's a long stout stick, ma'am, that's used often and often to beat
the little ones employed in the mills when their strength fails-when
they fall asleep, or stand still for a minute,''
 Do you mean, that the children work till they are so tired as to
Iall asleep standing?
 Yes, ma'am. Dozens and dozens of 'em every day in the year
except Sundays, is strapped, and kickel, and banged by the billy-
roller, hecause they falls asleep.'
But, surely, parents are greatly to blame, to let children young
enough for that, go to work at all?
 They must just starve, ma'am, if they diln't,'' replied the girl
: How many years bave you worked in the factory yourself
Sophy?'
 Just twelve, ma'am, this last spring.''
And how old are you?'
 Seventeen, ma'am.''
 Twelve from seventeen ?--Yfou mean to say that you began to
work at the factory when you were five years old?'' said Mary, with
ome appearance of incredulity.
I was five years and three months, maam,'' answered the gil
firmly.
MIiss Brotherton looked at Mns. Tremlett, but perceived no apear-
ance of incredulity on her countenance. `` Is this possible, Mrs.
Iremlet?'' said she.
 Yes, my lear, I believe that it is very common,'' replied the old
woman. `' I have often heard it spoken of among the servants.''
Have you ever been at school, Sophy?''
t Yes, ma'am. Afore father changed his mill and took work under
Sir Muatthew we all-father, mather, Grace, Dick, and all, worked for
the great uaker gentleman, Joseph Tell, and he had a school in the
factory for Sundays.''
``And ou learnt to real there of course?'
' No, ma'am, I didn't;'' replied the girl, shaking her head.
WFhose fault was that, my dear 3-Surely if you were put to school,
you ought to have learnt to read1'

upon respecting the system by which the factory labor is regulated,
that is quite hopcless.''
She felt, however, that the weary-looking group oght not to retur
empty-handed after their walk, with no reward for it but her promises:
and turning to MIrs. Tremlett, asked her in a half whisper what she
could give them, that might be made immediately useful in the way of
clothing; their garments being in a condition that it was painful to
her to behold.
You might givse them that piece of dark cotton, my dear, that yo
bought the other day for the coachman's children. There is no great
hurry you know about them, for they are not to go to school till next
month,''
 Very true.-It is just the thing,'' replied Mary; and having rung
the bell and ordered her maid to appear, she gave ordcrs to have it
brought to her.
I do not exactly know how much there is of it, Sophy,'' said she,
putting it into her hand, `` but enough, I think, for one or two of you,
and I will get more of the same sort wvhen next I go to Ashleigh.''
ophy took it with a courtesy; but having held it for a moment
said,  Please, ma'am, this won't be no use to me, unless I may pawn
part to get the rest made,''
 Can you not make a gown for yourself and your sisters, my good
girl?'' demanded Mary.
 Please, ma'am, l never was learnt to sew,'' replied the girl,
blushing.
Mfore convinced than ever, that her first effort to assist the poor
operatives, had led her by an unlucky chance into a family, whose
unthrifty habits made it almost hopeless to attempt doing them any
essential service, Mary drew forth her purse, and giving hal-a-crown
to each of them, took the useless material back, saying, : I will send
you some ore decent clothes to wear, fSophsy-and then we must
think what further can be done for you and these poor little ones.
But, indeed, my dear girl, I greatly fear that unless your habits are
improved, and that yon can be taught to use your neodle like all other
decent young women, in making and mending what is given you, it
will be impossible for me, or for any one to do you much good.''
Poor Sophy Drake looked both sorry and ashamed as she listened to
this reproof,-but she attempted not to answer il, and again courtesy-
ing as she received the money, she turaed away without again speak-
ing, and left the room.
This is very, very dreadful 1 nurse Tremlett,'' said Mary, as soon
as they were alone. I could not have believed that it was possible
in such a country as England, to find human heings in a state of such
degraded ignorance as that poor girl. Did you ever meet with any
thing like it before?''
I can't say, Miss Mary, that l ever before came within reach of
hearing a factory-girl speak so mueh as l have heard to-day. ButI can't
pretend to say that I am a bit surprised. I told you, my dear, from
o MICHAEL ARSTRONG.
151
the beginaiug, that you would only get yourself into trouble, and do
no good. From the very first of my coming to this country, which
was but a month before lI came to live with your mamma, I always heard
the same history of the factory folks. And you know, my dear, what
every body says, must be true.''
hMlary, as she listened to this, looked harassed, puzzled, and
wretched. ` But is it not something unheard of in the history of th
world,'' said she, '` that thousands and hundreds of thousands of
persons slould cxist, all labouring, young and old, with unceasing
industry to support themselves, and that this their painful labour
should subject them to such habits of inevitable ignoranee and de-
gradation, that all decent and respectable persons must be taught to
shun thc ?'
It does seem very harl upon them, my dear, to be sure,'' replied
her companion; `` but as to why it is so, lI am sure it is impossible for
us to guess. It must be partly their own faults of course; but at any
atc, my dear, I wish you would not go on, working yourself up so.
I can't ear to see you, Miss Mlary, looking vexed and miserable for
what you can't help the least bit in the world. And besides, my dear,
I must say, that it is nowise right for a young lady like you to run
the risk of getting ncar very bad pcople indeed, whose ways I don't
like to talk to you about. I know you can't abide Sir Matthew
Dowling, and I can't say I ever saw or heard of much to like in him;
but for all that, there is not any goeod that I can see in disbelieving
what he told us about these very people. He must know more about
them than we can, and it was quite shocking I do assure you, Miss
Mary, the things he told me. A grcat deal too bad to rcpeat, I
promise you.''
Mlary burst into tears. `I am very unhappy, Mrs. Tremlett,'' said
she, `` and it is not putting faith in Sir Matthew Dowling that can
make me less so. That I may be led to do many things from my great
ignorance, which were lI better informed I should not do, is very likely;
and it is therefore my duty to obtain information upon this tremendous
subject as speedily as possible. Would to God, my good friend, that
you could gie it mel but as you cannot, we will ceasc to spceulate
together upon what we neither of us understand. I am sorry that our
awful adventure yesterday, prcvcnted my purposed visit to the poor
woman in Hoxley-lane. We both agreed, you know, that I could get
no harm there; and I havc an object in view in making that visit that
I am sorry to have delayed. We will go there to-morrow, nurse
Tremlett,-and so early in the morning, as to run no risk of meeting any
of the fine folks who love to show themselves on the Ashleigh road.''
Mlary Drotherton did go early the following morning to Hoxley-lane.
But her visit was too late, by exactly twenty-four hours.

likely she would be unhappy if we. persuadled her, let it turn out as it
would,''
Instead of answering, Sir Matthew suddenly wheelced round, and
looked out of the window, as if the bit of stony mould extending
ten feet deep to the ditch that ienced it, contained something of pecu-
liar interest and curiosity. During this interval, which lasted about a
minute, the widow Armstrong again fixed her eyes pon thc face of
Martha, with an appealing look that seemed to implore assistance from
her judgment, while it evidently expressed confidence in her kindness.
When Sir Matthcw again permitted his countenance to be visible to
them, it expressed nothing but indifference; but Martha thought it was
such an easy good -natured sort of inlifference that there could be no
danger in bringing him back to the subject, even though he said as he
turned round, ` Come, my dear Mlarthia, l ceannot stay another moment,
I do assure you.''
1 am quite ready, papa,'' she replied; `'but don't you think it is
almost a pity to let such an opportunity be lost tfor poor Michael ?''
 Certainly it is, my dear,'' he replied in the most good-humoured
accent imaginable.  But what would you have me do, y dear child?
Depend npon it there is no real charity in assisting people against
their will, or in a manner in any way contrary to their inclinations.
You know perfectly well, that it was my real aud sincere wish that this
good voman's child should be wcll provided for. An opportunity for
loing this, better far than I could have hoped for, is now preposed
but evidently does not mcet her wishes. Unfortunately l must send
thc answer by to-day's post, and surely you would not recommend me
to aceept this situation for the boy, excellent as it is, against his
mother's wil] g
 No papa-only it seems to me that Mrs. Armstrong has not quite
made up her mind about it; and I thought perhaps that a few inutes'
consideration might enable her to perceive how great a loss it would be
to Michael were she to refuse it.''
 Wall, Martha'' returaed the knight with a sort of jocose sigh,
and at the same time seating himself on one of the widow's treasured
rush-hottomed chairs,  I would rather make the person l expect wait
at Dowling Lodge for an hour, than eiher disappoiat your kind heart,
or hurry this good woman into saying any thiug that she does not really
mean. What does the little fellow himself say about it?'
He's grateful and tlankful, sir, for what is offered to him, and
willing he is to accept it.-'Tis oly my poor weak siek heart that has
got no courage lef in it. You think, miss, he had better take it1' she
adled, turaing her anxious eyes unon lartha.
For a nioment Martha felt a repugnance to the taking upon herself,
as it were, the responsibility of the transaction, but an exclamation
from her father settled the business at once.
 Poor soul'' said he. '` Ilow natural is this weakness1 Give her,
by your advice, the strength she wants, MIartha-it is the most valuable

Iuleed papa is very right, Mrs. Armstrong,'' said Martha cheer-

 HIere Parsons, sign away l'' said Sir Matthew gaily,. as he with-
drew the document from the bed. The ready servant obeyed, and his
fellow-driver followed his example, without waiting for any further
instructions.
 Now then, Martha, let us be ofi'' cried the knight, moving to-
wards the door as he pocketed the papers. But stopping suddenly
efore he opened it he said, `` By the way, Parsons, as chance has
brought you here, we may as well make use of you about getting a
few necessaries for our little stocking-weaver. We must trust to you
to get whatever may be wanted. He may take the clothes he has worn
at the lodge, for Sundays, but of course they would not be suitable for
him to work in.''
 Very well, Sir Matthew, I will see about it,'' replied the important
overlooker.
1 must have no time lost, if you please'' rejoined his master rather
sharply: `` for Mr. Elgood harpton meotioned in his letter, that he
should be having some of his people passing this way who might
take charge of him, and I am sure lI can't say when they may happen
to call. So go directly into the town, Parsons, and buy whatever you
think the boy may want. I dare say this will he very nearly the last
expense, Mrs. Armstrong,'' he addel, `' that I shall be put to for him,
and I assure you that I shall pay it very willingly.''
With these words he left the room, and Martha pronouncing a short
but kind farewell, followed him. Soon after she had oertaken him,
and again passed her arm through his, she was startled by a violent
burst of laughter, and on looksing back, perceived at no great distance
behind them, Parsons and his companion, taking their way over a style
that led by a short cut to Brookford factory. lIt was from them the
hearty laugh hal proceeded.

AT DowLIG LODGE, UT FAILS U OULTAIIG wIIAT SHE wET O.
As soon as Miss Brotherton and Mrs. Tremlett had finished their
breakfast on the morning aler the interview with Sophy Drake in the
drawing-room at Milford Park, they set of together on foot to visit the
widow Armstrong in Hoxley-lane.
 Nothing can happen to us worse than our adveuture in the car-
riage the day before yesterday,'' obscrvel the young lady; `` you will
confess, dear friend, will you not, that Sir Matthew's walking into the
r 2
164

carriage was more terrible than any thing likely' to befall us on the
high-road without one?''
 Why, 1 suppose I must, my lear,'' answvered the old lady; ` for
to tell you the truth, I don't think you could look more put out if a
constabhle were to comc up and arrest you.''
Decidedly not, Mrs. remlcett: and listen to the birds, and snif
the sweet air, and then tell me if we are not wise to walk 2''
he oId woman confessed that she really did enjoy it, and on they
went with the gardener's oy or a guide, till in less than an hour they
found themselves before the door of No. 12, in Hoxley-lane. Pro-
bably thcir little pioneer was not one of the widow's visiters, for the
pass trough the hedge, lculing to the back-kitchcn doo appeared
unkuown to him, and in answer to Miss Brotherton's knock for admit-
tance, the principal entrance to No. l2 was opened by the ragged
aistress of the tenemcnt.
Does the widow Armstrong live here?'' inquired Miary. ss Yes,
ma'am,'' observed the woman gloomily; continuing as she made way
for tle ladies to enter, The widow Armstrong is a lucky woman-
she has got but one clild left to provide for, and yet the gentlefolks
keeps coming to help her, but nobody thinks of me and my ten young
ones.''
The ready hand of Miss Brotherton was immediatcly in her purse.
 That is a large family indeed, my good woman. Are they none of
them old enough to help themselves ?''
:The seven oldest have all been in the factory from amost the time
they could stand ma'am,'' replicd MIrs. Sykes, `` and if tley hadn't,
they must have been dcal and buried long ago for want of bread. But
though they have worked poor creturs, early and late, there's no more
come of it, than that fheir bones be here instead of in the churchyard.''
But with so large a number, all receiving wages,'' said Miss bBro-
therton, gently, 1 should have hoped that you might have found
yourselves better off than you seem to be.''
` And that's what we are told, maam, from years end to yenrs end,
and we must bear it, for there is no help. bBut 'tis a'most as bitter as
the work that grinds us,''
Neither the person or manner of Mrs, Sykes were in any degree
prepossessing; shc was dirty, and in evcry way untidy in the extreme.
She had on her feet the fragments of a pair of mcn's shoes, but no
stockings, the rest of her clothing bcing barely sufficicent to cover her.
Her eye, voice, and complexion, furnished strong indications of her
being accustomed to take spirits, while her frightfully thin limbs gave
her the appearance of being half starved. In short, it was impossible
to look at her without feeling that she was a degraded, as well as a
suffering heing. Mary Drotherton did feel this, and hcr heart sunk
within her as she thought of Sophy Drake, of her drunken father, and
of all Mrs. Tremlets had told her respecting the vice, which like a
wide-spreading and hideous epidemic, seemed to ravage in all direc-
tions the miserable neighbourhood in which fate had placed her. She
shuddered as she contemplated the wretched being that stood hefore

1I66
her, nnd till she had spoken the words given above, a deep feeling of
the woman's unworthiness chilled the ready pity of her warm young
heart. IBut both in these words themselves, and in the tone of quiet
settled despair in which they were spoken, there was a frightful and
mysterious allusion to some species of injustice and cruelty, under
which accusation she seemed herself to he included.
The distaste and reprobation that were a moment before making
hasty inrods upon her benevolence, seemed suddenly arrested as she
listened: and she was abont to repeat again the questions she had
already so uselessly asked, as to whence this universal severity of
judgment against the factory labourers arose; and wherefore, eyond
all others, submitted to the sentence which dooms human beings to
toil, these people should appear to loath their employment, and exe-
crate, as it should seem, the very means by which they lived. But ere
her lips opened to demand the explanation to whiel she so eageirly
desired to tlisten, a glance at the hard features of the wretched woman
checked her. ' It cannot be from such as these,'' thought she, `` that
truth and instruction can be reasonably' looked for''-and as she
silently gave her alms, and moved onwards towards the door which
had been pointed to, as that of the widow Armstrong, something like
a systematic project for making herself mistress of the knowledge she
wanted, for the first time suggested itself to her imagination.
Mrs. Sykes eyed the silver largesse, as it tell into her hand, with a
glance that seemed to devour it, and the words of thanks she uttered
were almost hysterical in their eager vehemenee. After delaying a
moment ior the contemplation of this precious '' drudge 'twixt man and
man,'' she opened the door of communication, and Mliss Brotherton
and her friend passed into the dwelling-room of the widow Arntstrong.
Contrary to custom, her lame boy, Edward, was sitting on the side
of her bed, and when MIary entered, he was holling her hand, and
gazing in her face with an expression of countenance which appeared
to both the intruders to be the most piteous they had ever looked upon.
The poor child was looking, too, most wretchedly ill, and the first idea
which suggested itself was, that he felt himself to be dyiug.
Notwithistanding the extreme poverty of the widow Armstrong, there
was an air of decency and decorum about her, that might in any situa-
tion have commanded respect; but when contrasted with the appear-
ance of her neighbour, seemed to indicate a claim to more observance
than her visiters were showing by this sudden and uninvited entrance.
I beg your pardon, Mrs. Armstrong,'' said Mary. gently, for
breaking in upon you so abruptly; and I fear our doing so may have
startled your sick child.-This little fellow is vrery ill, 1 fear.''
 It is long since he has known health, ma'am,'' replied the widow;
`` but it is not that which makes him look so whie and trembling
now. We have lost what was dearer to us both than all the world
beside-and though I dou't think as this one will ever look np agaln,
I can't find a word in my heart to comnfort him l''
 WVhat, then, has happened to you?'' said Mlary, with much inte-
rest-'` Nothing bad to your son Mlichael, I hope2''
166
TmE LIFR AND ADENTURES
 You know Michael, ma'am ?'' said the poor woman, anxiously.
:tI have seen him at Sir Matthewe Doling's,'' she replied.
:sI wish you never had, ma'amn 1' rejoined the widow, bitterly-
 We were only starving before, butnow we are worse than that.''
 Do explain to me what you mean, Mrs. Armstrong,'' said
Mary.
I ought to do it, ma'am, for you speak kindly; and that's a claim
poor folks san seldom withstand,.-But how can I tell you the matter,
ma'am ? I know nothing-and that's the reason why poor Edward and
I are so miserable.''
 But that is a bad way to get into, my gcod MIrs. Armstrong,'' said
Mary, cheerfully.  Don't fret yourself about fancied evils, which
perhaps do not exist. Little Edward here should know better thn
that,
The pale, brokenhearted boy looked at her with lack-lustre eyes,
but said nothing.
 Are you uneasy because Michael has not been down to see you
lately?'' resumed Miss Brotherton.
 He never failed to come, ma'am, till he was carried away from us 1'
xreplied the widow, with a sob, that seemed the result of strength ex-
hausted, and weakness that could struggle no longer.
Carried away from you I'' eried Mary, changing colour.  What
do you mean, MIrs. Armstrong? who has carried away Mlichael from
you 7''
Sir Matthew Dowling, ma'am, has had him taken away,'' and
another sob followed the words.
Do not think I torment you thus from idle curiosity,'' pursued
Mary, bending over her; `but I entreat you to explain to me fully
what yo mean. I am greatly interested for your little boy.''
ttI thank you for it, ma'am,'' returned the poor mother, mournfully;
but I can tell little that you, or any grand lady, the friend of Sir
Matthew, would think to the purpose. Yet the parting with him with-
out one blessing, or one kiss, is hard to bear, though we don't justly
know that any harnr's to come to him.''
1I am no particular friend of Sir Matthew Dowling's,'' replied
Mary, with an acecent which perhaps spoke more than her words.
Then I will tell you about Michael'' exclaimed the lame boy,
coming round the bed to the place where she was standing, and look-
ing into her face as if he thought he could read all her thoughts there.
t You have seen poor Mike when he was living there, ma'am?''
 Yes, I have, my dear boy,'' she replied, gazing with deep feeling
at his pale, but beautiful countenance;  I have seen him there more
than once, IEdward, and I am quite sure he was not happy, though he
was dressed so fine.''
 He was more unhappy ten times over,'' replied Edward, '` than
when he was as ragged as me.''
 WVas he unkindly treated ?'' demandel Mary.
He was beaten, kicked, and spit upon1'' eried Elward, bursting
into tears; ` and then he was told to laugh, and look merry.''
o MICRAEL ARM9TnoONG.
167
A wretched, wretehel, sort of cruelty1'' she replied, `` of which I
can well believe Sir Matthew capable. lBut you surely do not suppose
that he has run away from it without telling you or his mother that he
had such an intention ?2'
If you knew Mike better, ma'am, you wouldn't think that he could
do such wickedness,'' said the mother. He has stood beating with strap
nnd stick for years, ma'am, young as he is: and never asked to stop
from the mill a day, though he has been bruised almost to a jelly;-and
worse than that, too, poor lamb a hundred fold, with such a heart as
his, he has seen his lame brother there, that was always dearer, a
great deal, to him than himself-he has seen the cruel stripes fall on
his poor shoulders, too: and though he has come home with his little
face washed with tears from it, he didn't think of running away.''
Mary saw that she had given pain, and hastened to atone for it by
expressing her sorrow for supposing such a thing possible; and then
repeated her request, that she might be told what it was that had
happened.
The widow then related more succinctly than might have been ex-
pectel, all that had passel between herself, her boy, and Miss Martha
Dowling, on the morning which followed the theatrical representation
at Dowling Lodge. And before she proceeed further, Edward bore
testimony to the spirited and courageous willingness with which his
brother had adopted the proposed scheme. He had, it seemned, as
usual, watched Teddy's return from the factory-told him what Sir
Matthew proposed doing for him, and declared, that hard as it would
be to part with him and '' mother,'' he was ready and willing to start,
and was quite determined to be the best boy that ever was 'prenticed,
and to be workman enough to maintain them both as soon as his time
w8 Out.
Here the widow again resumed her narrative, and related very ae-
curately the scene of the following morning; dwelling much on the
young lady's kind manner, and on her own putting it to her whether
she advised that the ehild should go, or not.
'And Martha Dowling counselled you to let him go?'' demanded
Miss Brotherton.
es, again and again, she did,'' replied the peor mother.
:You are quite sure it was Miss Miartha2''
t Oh, yes1 ma'am; my Mike took care to make me understand that,
the day they came together,''
 Then be quite easy in your mind, MIrs. Armstrong,'' said Mary,
eagerly. :I have no great liking for Sir Matthew bDowling. I da
not think well of him, nor have I much to say in favour of any of his
family. They seem to me to he cold-hearted, selfish people. But fon
this one, this Miss Martha that you speak of, I will undertake to an-
swer for it that she has never deceived you, and that if she advised you
to let Michael go, it was because she thought the doing so would be
advantageous for him,''
t Bless you ior ever and for ever, ma'am:'' criet MIrs. Armstrong,
seizing the hand of Mary, and pressing it to her lips.  There is
168
E LIFE AND ADVENTRES
truth, maam, in your voice, and in youreyes. Do as I do, Edward,
dear1 look at the kind face of this young lady, and see if you can't
find comfort from what she says? I did think, myself, ignorant as I
am, that the young lady had an honest facte. But, ohl ma'am, let it
be as it will, and make the very best of it, 'tis cruel to have our
darling taken away in this fashion, without one word of take-leave and
blessing :''
'Indeed i is1'' replied Mlary; ``and your being ignorant of the
place of his destination increases this anxiety. But on this point, at
least, I think I shall bhe able to set your mind at rest. Before this
time to-morrow, I will take care to see some part of the family at the
Lodge, and shall certainly not scruple to inquire every particular re-
specting your boy. Ieep up your spirits therefore, both of you; and
for the future, let this little fellow here look to me for his wages. I
won't have him go to the factory any more. What sum has he been
receiving for his work 2''
Astonishment very literally rendered the widow Armstrong dumb,
on hearing this most extraordinary proposal. Poor soul1 a few short
days ago it would have been sufficient to make her forget her weak-
ness and her want, and have put her in a state of mind that queens
might envy; for she would hardly have bcen able to remember that it
was possible to have another wish; but now the first use she made on
recovering her speech, was to exclaim,  Oh1 Michael : Miehuel I why
beant yo by to hear this2''
He shall hear it, Mrs. Armstrong,'' sail Mlary, in a voice of such
cheerful confidenee, that the tcrrors of both molher and son seemed to
vanish efore it. Mrs. Tremlett, too, ventured to add an encouraging
commentary upon MIary's promised visit of inquiry at the Lodge, ob-
serving, that it was altogether out of probability that they should want
to make any mystery as to where the little fellow was gone.
Mrs. Armstrong, as she listened, seemed almost too happy to credit
the evidence of her own senses; but in the deep-set melancholy eye
of Edward, there was still an expression of suffering and of fear that
looked as if misery had taken a hold upon him that could not be re-
linquished.
 Now I must goi'' said the soung lady, rising, ``or I shall hrdly
have time to keep my promise. But I must settle with you first, my
dear boy. What was the amount of your wages by the month ?''
 Six shillings, ma'am,'' replied Edward, looking at her, as she
drew out her purse, with an eye that seemed to doubt what it beheld.
Six shillingsI'' cried MIiss Bratherton, as she put the pitiful wage
of a long month's agony into the liule trembling hand. ``And have you
lost your health and liberty for this'' Tears started to her eyes, as
she contemplated the look of wonder and delight expressed by the
countenance of the poor widow; yet that look was not turned upon
her. Stretching out her arms to the boy, she caught him to her bo-
som, and held him there, mueh as if she had suddenly beheld him
snatched from the fangs of soe devouring monster. . The face of the

child himself, she could not scee, but his whole frame trembled, and
they iancied he was shedding tears.
tGod bless you both1'' she said, `` to-morrow you shall see me
again.'' And so saying she took the arm of her friend, and again
ssed through the dwelling-room of Mrs. Sykes. The woman had
no three iittle dirty creatures round her, to whom she was giving
bread.
` Heaven keep you, ma'aml This is your treat.'' she said, as
MIary and her friend passel through, ` lt is the first time for many a
week that I have fed em so freely, poor creturs.''
Miss Brotherton's heart was too full to answor-she notded her
head and passed on. Their homewnrd walk, up Hoxley-lane, across
the London roasd, and along a pretty shaded ridle-road that led to.a
gate in her own park-paling, was performned almost entirely ia silence.
There is a state of mind in which ideas come with too much violence
and rapidity to be told of in worda. When this happens irom an
excess of happy imaginings, no condition can be more delightful: but
when, as in the present case, it arises from the remembrance of painful
realities, it is greatly the reverse. The misery around her was  no
Ionger a matodr of oubful speculation, but of most frightful cer-
tainty. Neither was it any vice in liule Fdward Armstrong, which
udrove him to offer up his sickly sufering frame to ceaseless labour at
the rate of threepence for each long, painful day. She felt oppressed,
overwhelmed, and almost hopneless. Yet at that time Mary Brotherton
knew not, gucssed not, dreamed not, of the hundredth part of what
the unhappy class who had thus roused her human sympathies, were
daily and hourly suffering around her.
The first words she spoke on entering her house were to orler her
carriage, and having gone so far in the performance of the task she
had undertaken, she turned with tender kindness to her old friend,
and gave as much cnre to her comfort and refreshment, as if the rela-
tive situation which they had borne to each other in days of yore was
uet reversed, and that Mary was tbe nurse, and Mrs. Tremlett the
nursling.
' You chall do nothing more before dinner, my dear good soul, hut
lie down upon the sofa, and get cool. Not even Mns. Gabberly, I
9ppose, could see any thing particularly dangerous and improper, in
my geing alone to pay a visit to Marthn Dowling.''
And alone to Dowling Lodge the heiress went, pretty steadfastly
determined not to leave it, till she had learnt exactly at what point of
the earth's surface Michael Anstrong might be tound.
She inquirel for Martha, and was shown as usual into my Iady's
mnorning drawing-room, where to her extreme annoyance she found her
lasship, Sir Maihew, Lady Clarissa Shrimpton, and MIiss Mogg-
If Lady Dowling could have been glad to see any pretty young
lady, it ould have been Miss Brotheriton, and she did exert hersel,
more than usual, to be civil; while, on the contrary, Sir Matthew both

he had eer done since the fact of her heiress-ship had become matter

1 would tell you in a moment, if I knew, my dear Mliss Brother-
ton, but i do not. His departure at last was very sudden; owing,
I believe, to papa's having tiound some particularly goed opportnity
of sending him.''
eI wonder you should never have asked where he was sent to, Miss
Martha,'' said Mlary, gravely.
I did ask, Miss Brotherton,'' replied Martha; '` but papa said he
could not recollect the name of the place,''
:::'::
he may have recollected it, since, my dear-I wish you would run in,
and ask him to come to me for a moment.''
Martha seemed to hesitate. I am sure,'' said she, after a little
hesitation, ` that papa would be delighted to come here to talk with
you, Miss Brotherton-only Lady Clarissa might-''
Nay, then, I'll go to him myself,'' said Mary, rather abruptly.
eThere is no particular objection, I suppose, to Lady Clarissa's being
let into the secret of little Michael's abode.'' And immediately turn-
ing her steps towards the house, she re-entered the drawing-room, fol-
lowed by MIartha.
They found Sir Matthew engaged in exhibiting a portfolio of splen-
did engravings to her ladyship, who was descanting upon them with
rapture; though the application of a near-sighted glass to one
long-sighted eye, while the other was effectually closed, rendered them
pretty nearly iuvisible to her.
1 beg ten thousand pardons, Sir Matthew,'' said the heiress, placing
herself at the opposite side of the loo-table, and thereby commanding
a perfeet view of his countenance; `` but you are too goodnatured, lI am
sure, to be angry with me, een though I do interrupt you. Will you
have the kindness to tell me, sir, while Lady Clarissa is lost in admi-
ration of that enchanting Venus, where little Michael Armstrong has
been sent to?''
The question was too unexpected for even Sir Matthew's sturdy self-
possession, to receive it as he would have wished to do. His bold eye,
wvhich had been gaily fixed on the young laly, as she spoke to him,
fell befre her keen, inquiring glance, and he turnel the pagec of Lady
Clarissa's adoration with rather unseemly rapidiy. as he replied, `` To
a tradesman-that is, to a manufacturer, some miles further north,
Miss Brotherton. I have just been telling Lady Clarissa,'' continued
the knight, recovering his audacity, :I have just been telling her all
the little fellow's adventures. The love of novelty seemed to have su-
persedel all other love in his young leart, for he was delighted to go.''
?RBut he could not have liked going without taking leave of his
mother and brother, Sir MIatthew. I hne just seen them, and they
are in a perfect agony about him-in fact, I am come here on purpose
to ask wshere he has been sent,''
oE MrCHAEL ARIsTRONG.

Fairest of messengersl'' exclaimel the knight, with a tender smile,
`` how utterly miserable shall I be if I cannot auswer you-I think it
is to Halifx, I am almost surethat it is cither to Halilax or Wakcfield
that he is gone.''
 You have bound the little fellow apprentice, you do not know
where?'' said Miss Brotherton, wvith undisguised astonishment.
I do not say that, my dear young lady, I know he is apprenticed
to an excellent good man, who is a stockiug-weaver; but he has two
or three large cencerns belonging to him, and I protest to you that at
this moment I really cannot suy to which this little fellow has been
sent.''
I am quite shockcd to give you so much trouble, Sir Matthew,''
returned Mlary, `` but I should be exceedingly obliged if you would
learn the name of the place, and let me know it. I vcnturel, sir, to
promise the boy's mother that I would learn this for her, and I am
q(uite sure that you will not let me disappoint her.''
t' Most assuredly notl1 I will call or send to-morrow at the latest, my
charming MIiss DBrotherton How I adore your benevolcnce? No
wonder you are such friends, Lady Clarissal Iour hearts are made
upon the same model 1'
To this satisfactory assurance liss Brotherton made no answer;
but telling Sir Matthew that she should remain at home on the morrow
for the purpose of receiving his promised information, took her leave.
Wih increased dislike of Sir Matthew, perhaps, yet witl no very
serious fears about the fate of little ichael, Miss Brotherton haldly
determined to brave all the wonder which the act might occasion, and
ordcred her carriage to stop at No. 12, Hoxley-lane, Ashleigh.
As it happened, however, she esceaped all her military admirers, and
reached the widow Armstrong without interruption; the absorbing
mills were in full activity, and few of the iuhabitants of the misarable
region through which she passed were loft to gaze on the unwonted
spectacle. The answcr she hrought was recaived by the widow and
her boy with breathless attention; but it was quite evident that it did
not altogether remove the sort of vague terror which seemed to have
taken possestion of them. Mary's cheerful assurance, however, that
she should soon bring them more satisfactory intclligence, could not
be listened to without good afect; and she left them at last so in-
finitely happier than she had found them, that spite of Sir Matthew's
unsatisfactory reply, and tmore unsatisfactory manner, she still blessed
her morning's work,

AxD where was little Michael? The indentures, when duly signed
and executed, did not remain two hours in Sir MIatthew Doling's
possession hefore he began to put in action the power they gave him.
Mr. Joseph Parsons perfeetly understood the nature of the ``few ne-
cessaries'' which he was commanded to procure for the young stocking-
weaver; and accordingly, by the time Sir Matthew had taken leave of
Martha in the hall, after their walk back from Hoxley-lane, his confi-
dential agent was ready to attend him in his study.
 No, Mr. Parsons, I flatter myself that you will allow I have
managed this busiaess tolerably well. My excellent friend, Elgood
Sharpton, will owe me a good turn-for, thanks to the meddling of
old Sir Robert, 'prentice-boys are not so easily got as they used to be
-and you and I, Mr. Parsons, have got rid of a most infernal spy.
Now then, to business. How soon can you set off with him 2''
: As soon as a horse can be harnessed to the jockey-cart, Sin
Matthew.''
The jockey-cart 1-the devil: WVhat a fool you are, Parsons1
Have you really no more wit in you than to propose setting off, willy-
nilly, with this youg cur, that yelped at the rate he did the other
night, before all the fine folks in the county, in an open jockey-cart:
Fie, Mr. Parsons, fiel-I really had a better opinion of your under-
standing.''
 1I thought he was goig to set off, at any rate, by his own free
will, Sir Matthew,'' replied the superintendent, `` and I knew when
we got among the moors, it wouldn't much matter to me, if he did
sing out.''
 You are an excellent fello, Parsons-true to the backbone,
and as firm as a rock-but don't you ever undertake to carry through
such a pretty little kidnapping scheme as this, where erery thing is to
be done according to law, unless you have got the help of a little such
stuff as this,'' and the knight touched his own forehead expressively
as he spoke.
 here's few men as wouldn't be the better for a little of that, Sir
Matthew,'' returned the judicious Parsons with a submissive nod;
 but I'm ready and willing to do your bidding, be it what it may,
and that's the best way of putting your honour's wit to profit,''
 You are right there, my good fellow-one captain is always better
than two. But, however, as to master Nichael, Parsons, we must
neither let him stay loitering here till his dainty mother has questioned
all the gossips who will come to prate with her about her boy, and

 WVell now, don't he look like as well-behaved and pretty a young
gentleman as one would wish to see'' continued the farmer, turning
to the young girl, `` and yet there's no mistaking that t'other's his
master,''

cried Parsons contemptuously, and turning one of his threatening

you'll find out perhaps, as all is not gold as glitters.''
' Poor little follo ?'' exclaimed the farmesr, on meeting the super
intendent's ill-omened eye.:  I wish, with all my heart, master, that
noboly cared no more tfor yur ugly looks than 1 do.''
Dame Pritchard,'' said Parsons, without appearing to hear him,
Lot the boy and me have a bit of supper, d'ye hear. Spite of his
fine clothes, however, which were but a gift of charity, the boy is
neither better nor worse, than one of our factory children.''
I ould not have thought itl'' sai the old man, apparently satis-
fied, and turning to his mug.
 No, I dare say,'' retorted Parsons, with a sneer.  Such chaps as
you, seldom finds out what's what, or who's who, before they are told.''
From this moment no further interest was expressed about little
Michael. IIe weas afactory boy, and what good was there in asking
any further questions So a thick slice of bread, and a scrap of bacon
were set before him, and as soon as the more elaborate supper of MIr.
Parsons was concluded, he with great affability took the little fellow
by the hand, and preceded by Dame Pritchard and a candle, con-
ducted him to a pallet bed in the same chamber as his own.
For the first moment after he was left alone with the boy, the
superintendent felt a strong inclination to make him pay for the
aiffronts he had been the cause of his receiing below. But the same
wisdom which had cut shaort his indignation there, checked him now;
an havsing locked the chamber door, and given Michael a stimulating
kick to hasten his undressing, he careully packed in a bundle the
Dowling Lodge suit which he took off, leaving in its placee besile the
bed, the result of his hasty shoppings at Ashleigh.
WVhen roused from his slumbers at day-break the following morn-
ing, Nlichael found these new garmeuts ready for him, and for a
momont his heart sunk at the change, for though new, they were of
the very lowest kind, and formed as strong a contrast as was well
possible with the dress he had lid asite on ipreparing for his night's
rest. But the human mind will often show symptoms of philosophy
even at ten years old; which truth was made evident by the manner
in which the young apprentice invested himself in his naw suit, cheer-
ing his spirit as he did so, with the recollection that a person going to
bc bouud to a trade like that of stocking-weaving, would look very
ridiculous in such a dress as had heen just taken away from him.
Early as it was, Mlrs, Pritehard was ready in the kitchen with'a
pot of hot tea'' for Mr. Parsons; Mlichael received a fitting hunch of
bread, the covered cart was brought up to the door, and the ill-matched
pair set off again upon their journey.

For about another half mile, the narrow cart-road runs heside tha
stream without encountering any single object, except its lofty barrier.
and the brook itself, more remarkable than here and there a reed of
higher growth than common, or a plant of Foxglove, that by its gay
blossom seems to mock the desolate sadness of the spot. Another
turn, howeer, still following the wavy curvings of the mountain's
base, for mountain there it seems to he, opens another view, and one
that speaks to many senses at once, the difference between the melan-
choly caused by nature, and that produced by the work of man. A
wide spreading cotton-factory here rears its unsightly form, and at one
glance makes the happy wanderer whose foot is free to turn which
way he will, feel how precious is the power of retracing his steps back
again along the beguiling path that has led him to it.
This was a joy for which our little Michel sighed in vain. On
Iegged the cart, and nearer it came at every jolt to the objct which
he most hated to loohk upon. But then came also the cheering thought,
that he was no longer a mere factory boy, but about to become an
apprentice to a good and profitable trade, in which hereafter he might
epect to get money enough for himself, for mother, and Teddy tool
Nevortheless, he certainly did wish, at the very bottom of his heart,
that the stocking-weaving business was not carried on in a building
so very like a cotton factory1 Dut though Michael saw this hatcd cotton
factory, he as yet saw but a small portion of the horrors which belonged
to the spot he had reached. His position in the vehicle mae it impos-
sible foi him to look round, and perceive how completely all the acts
that migbt be committed in that Deep alley, were hid from the eye
of every humnan being but those engaged in them. Neither could he
recognise in the dismal building detached, yet connectel hoth with the
manager's house and the factory, the Prisou Prentice-house which
served as onr to hundreds of little aching hearts, each one endowed
by nature with light spirits, merry theughts, and fond afections: but
all of whom rose to their daily toil under circumstances which rendered
enjoyment of any kind both morally and physically impossible.
The gradations by which all the misery that awvuited him was dis-
closed, were, however, neither lingering nor uncertain. The cart
stopped, Parsons got ott, and then calling forward his companlion,
seized him roughly by the arm, and swung him through the door which
opened to receive them.
 Soh This is the chap you are going to bestow upou us, is it,
Mr, Parsons ?'' said a fellow, whose aspect must have withered hope
in the gayest spirit that youth and joy ever produced between them.
 Has he nimble fingers?
He can move 'em quick enough when he've got a mind for it,''
replied Parsons.  But you must not spare the strap, I can tell yo,
for a more obstinate hard-skinned little devil, never crossed the thres-
hold of a factory.''
 Never mind, Mr. Parsons, we know how to manage all those
matters, you may depend upon it. We possess many advantages over
you, sir. No parents here you know, to come bothering us about


1I84
TR LIE AND ADVETUHES
and that under most hard and unrelenting masters; but till now,
he had never known how very wretched his young thoughts could
make him. His mother's fond caresses, and his brother's fervent love,
had in spite of toil, and sometimes in spite of hunger, cheered and
comforted the last moments of every day. The rude bed also, on which
the brothers lay, was too clean, notwithstanding all the difficulty of
keeping it so, to be tainted with the loathsome scent of oil, or sundry
other abominations which rendared the place where he now lay, almost
intolerable. Yet to this den, far, far away from the only creatures
who loved and cherished him, he was come by his own consent, his
own express desirel The thought was almost too bitter to bear, and
the bundle of straw that servedl him for a pillow, received for the first
hour of the night a ceaseless flood of tears.
It was, as his young companion had predicted, by the sound of a
flourished whip, that he was awakened on the following morning. In
an instant he wa on his feet, and a minute or two more sufficed to
invest him in his clothes; this speed, however, was the effect of terror,
for he remembered not the invitation of the preceding eening. But
hardly had he finishel the operation of dressing, when Charley Ford,
the boy who gae it, was by his side, and giving him a silent hint by
a wink of the left eye, and a movement of the right elbow that he
might follow him, turned away, and ran down stairs.
Michael did so too, and presently found himself with a multitude of
others in a small paved court, on one side of which was a pum, to
whose spout every child came in succession to perform a very neces-
sary, but, from lack of soap, a very imerfect act of ahlution.
Neglecting to watch his turn for this, and not permitting Michael
to do so either, Charles Ford made his way to a door that opened upon
another part of the premises, and pushing it open, disclosed to the eyes
of Miehael a loathsome and a fearful spectacle.
Seven or eight boys had already made their way to the sort of rude
farm-yard upon which this door opened, one and all of whom were
intent upon purloining from a filthy trough just replenished for the
morning meal of two stout hogs, a variety of morsels which, as
Michael's new acquaintance assured him, were `` dainty cating for the
starving prentices of Deep Valley mill''
 Make haste, young'un,'' cried Charles, good-naturedly, ``or they
won't leave a turnip-paring for us.'' And on he rushed to the scuffle,
leaving Michael gazing with disgust and horror at the contest between
the fierce snouts of the angry pigs, and the active fingers of the
wretched crew who contested with them for the offal thus cnst forth.
Michael Armstrong was a child of deep feeling: and it was, per-
haps, lucky for him, that the burning sense of shame and degradation
which pervaded every nerve of his little frame, as he looked on upon
this revolting spectaele, come upon him while yet too young for any
notion of resistance to suggest iiself. He felt faint, sick, and broken-
hearted; but no worm that ever was crushed to atotnas by the foot of
an elephant, dreamed less of vengeance than did poor Michel, as
the horid thought came over him, that he was going to abide in a

not yet reached that shrunk and wasted condition which was nearly
general among her companions. Michael looked at her as she bent
over her threads, and repaired the incessant breakings among them
with her white little hands, with a degree of love and pity which
while it wrung his heart, softened the harl despair that had nearly
seized upon him, by making him feel, that though his mother and
his brother were lost to him for long long years, during which he was
to taste of nothing but misery, still there was somebody who might
grow to love him. This was a timely solace: Young as he was, he
perceived at once, that instead of being brought to Deep Valley to
learn a trade, he had heen beguiled to enter there ound and helpless,
for more years thnan he dared to count, and with no prospect of learn-
ing any thing beyond the same slavish process of waiting upon the
machinery, which had painfully occupied his laily existence, and that
of his dearer brother, as long as they could remember to have lived.
Under these cireumstances, it was truly a great blessing to have found
somebody of whom he might make a friend, and so strougly did the
oor little fellow feel it, that when the miserable hand were led to
their morning meal, he told Fanny as he walked heside her, that he
thought he should grow to behave better than he had done that morn-
ing, if she would always talk to him about good things, and let him
talk about mother and Telly to her in return.
There's a good boy'' replied Fanny, soothinogly. `I will tlk to
you, Michael, whenever I can-and never mind,'' she added, as they
sat down again side by side at the long dirty board that formed their
breakfast table, `` never mind not having whats good to eat, it won't
taste so nasty by and bye, when you grow used to it.''
1 won't mind itl'' replied Michael, manfully, as he supped tha
musty-flavonred waery mess.  But I wish I had got a bit of good
bresd for you, FannyI''

Du the whole of the day which followed Miss Brotherton's
expedition to loxley-lane, that young lady remained waiting at home,
not very paticntly, for Sir Matthew Dowling's promised communica-
tion. But still it came not, and when, at an hour too late to hope for
it any longer, she at length retired to bed, it was in a state of irrita-
tion and anxiety that left her little chance of quiet slumber.

R LIFE AND ADvVEMTUnES
my dear hoy, this delay cannot justify the look of misery it produces
on your couantenance. Tell me, Edwrd, what is it that you fear for
Michael I''
I do not know myself,'' replied the boy. `` And yet I think it
over in my head day and night only to find out what is the very worst
possible they can do to him.''
2 But is that wvise, Edward, or is it right, think you, while your poor
mother has only you left to comfort her, tbat you should only strive to
fill your own head and hers with the very worst thoughts your fancy can
conjure up 7'
I do not fill mother's head with them,'' replied Edward. ' I have
never told er one single word of all my dismal thoughts.''
ee Then you are a good boy, and 1l love you for it. But what are
your dismal thoughts, Edward? Yon may tell them to me.''
The boy hesitated for a moment, aud then said-- 1 think Sir
Matthew Dowling is a wicked, cruel man: and I think that he would he
more likely to be wicked and cruel to Michael than good to him,''
 What is it has male you think Sir Matthew cruel and wicked, Ed-
ward ?'' demanded Miss Brotherton.
 Because he is hard and unjust to those who labour for him-and
because I have seen him laugh and make sport of the tears of little
children.,''
There was something in the accents of the boy that startlel MIary.-
She felt inclined to exclaim-- How much more older art thou than
thy looks1' so thrilling was the tone, and so profound the feeling with
which he spoke.
 Yet still,'' she replied, '` it is difficult to see that he could gain any
advantage by ill-using Michael in any way bal enough to make you
look so miserable, Edward,''
 If he keeps him from me is not that enough?'' sail the pale boy,
looking reprachfully at her.
 But, Edward, you knew that he was going to leave you: and your
mother, at least, consented to it,''
4 Yes, she did consent to it. Poor, dear mother 1 She did consent
to it. But had 1 been true, as I ought to have been, she never
would,'' said Edward, clasping bhis hands and closing his eyes with a
look of intense suffering.
 Explain yourself, my dear boy,'' said Mary, kindly.' In what
have you been atherwise than true t''
 We agreed together-poor Michael and me agreed together,neer
to let mother know how bad we were served at the mill--and, above
all, we agreed that she should never know how miserable Mlichael was
at the great house, 'cause we was sure she'd have him awa, and s0
lose the bit of comfortable food she has been having. WBut it was
wrong and wicked to deceive her. Wo should have told her all, and
then Mlichael would have never gone 1''
 You acted for the best, my dear boy, and must not reproach your-
self,'' replied Mary; ` and so far am I from thinkig it wrong to keep
her mind easy in her present state of health, that I strongly atdvise her

being still comforted as mucl as possible by our manner of talking to
her. Fear not, Eward, that I shall neglect the safety of Michael,
because you will not hear me talk of his being in any danger. I will
not rest till I know vhat has become of him.''
Mary said this in a tone that left no doubt of her sincerity; and it
was then for the first time that Edward seemed to remember her great-
ness. Ie stood up before her with a look of tender reverence inexpres-
sibly touching, and said solemnl- Then God will bless you for i1''
And he will bless you, my dear child?'' replied Mary, with tesrs.
starting to her eyes.  He will bless and comfort you for all yout
duty and atfection. Keep up your spirits, Eward, and, above all
things, never be idle. It is for your mother's sake as well as yowr own
that I am so anxious you should learn to read and write, dear Edward
--and by degrees we shall get you on to ciphering, and who knows
but we may make a clerk or accountant of you, and so enable you to
get money, even if your henlth is not very good,''
The boy smiled languidly as he replied, `` I should like it very much,
if I was to live long enough.''
You will get stout and well, Edward,'' said Mary, cheerfully,
t' now that you have no hard work to do. And you shall come up to
the same school that all my boys and girls go to here-and when
school is over, you must come every day to my kitchen with a little
basket for your mother. You understand, Edward? And once every
week yon must come up into this room to me with your books, that I.
may see your writing and hear you read a little.''
A gleam of hoe and joy kindled in the boy's beutiful eyes as he
listened to her, and a hright blush mantled his pale cheeks; but it was
like the flitting sunshine of April chased by a heavy cloud almost be-
fore its warmth could be felt or its beauty seen. e Oh l if Michael
could but hear that '' he exclaimed, while teass, for the first since the
conversation began, burst from his cyes. ss Tlat was what poor Mi-
chael always wanted. If I could but learn, and so get my bread with-
out mill-slavery, Mike always said he would notmind working hinself,
'cause he was so strong. But now that very thing is come; and he,
maybe, will never know it t''
Heavy and fast the drops fell from beneath the hand which he had.
raised to conceal his face, till Mary, as she watehed him, wept for
company. This, however, was not the way to help him, and conquer-
ing a weakness so every way unwise, she spoke to him with affectionate
but steady firmness of the exertion it was his duty to make at a time
when his mother had none but him to comfort her. She had touched
the right string--the little fellow's nerves seemed braced, and every
faculty awakened by the words she uttered; and if he took back to
his mother no tidings of poor Michael, he brought to her suppert a
yong spirit strong in endurance, and an intellect that, for the first
time, had whispered to its owner hopes, promises, and aspirations,
which seemed to ake the life he had often loathed a new-found trea-
sure to him. Mary saw not all that passed in the young mind she had
rescued from the listlass languor of despair, yet she perceived enough

Of course, my dear. And sucl a flirtation with Sir Matthew
God knows, I ain't over strict in any way; I despise it, because it
shows such ignorance of lifo and good society. But I must say, I da
think they carry the thing a little too far. Of course, a lady of rank
and title like Lady Clarissa, is not to be judged altogether like com-
mon people. I am quite aware of that, and nothing can be more
thoroughly vnlgar than forgetting this. And I certainly have lived too
much in really first-rate good society, not to know it. But, neverthe-

Was Laiy Dowling in presenee?'' inquircl Mis Brotherton,
smiling.
:: No, my dear, thank God she was not, or we should hare had sour
looks with our sweetmeats, I can tell you.''
Did Sir Matthew bring his little faourite with him? The little
boy he has adopted you know 2''
 Oh2 dear, haven't you heard all that yet Well now, pen ny
word, Mlary Brotherton, it will not do, your shutting yourself up in
this way. Catching cold, indeed1 As if I, the daughter of my own
poor dear father, wasn't likely to know more than Mrs. Tremlett about
catching cold: Why, my dear, the little boy has been sent away I
don't know how long, with a monstrous premium, paid by Sir Matthew,
to get him entered at one of the first commercial houses in Europe.
Dr. Crockley was exceedingly agreeable and attentive to me all day
yesterlay. And, indeed, so he was, I must say, to every body. We
do sometimes differ about spinal complaints, and I1 think he is a great
deal too speculative. But it is impossible to deny that be can be very
agreeable when he chooses it, and it was he that told me all about this
last noble act of Sir Matthew. To be sure he is an honour to the
country if ever there was one, fSir MIatthew, I mean. It is such men
as that, Miss DBrotherto, that brings wealth and prosperity to out
glorious coantry. To think only of the hands he employsl Fifeen
hundred children taking all his mills together, he told us yesterday,

that was one reason why good Sir Matthew was in such a hurry to
place him.''
Did you happen to hear to what part of the country the boy had
been sent, Mrs. Gabberly ?''
WVhy, nol my dear, I can't say I did. But that makes no diffe-
uce you know. Every body is aware that it is a noble situation for
him, and that's the main point of course.''
OhI1 certainl. I only asked from idle curiosity. And I suppose.
Mrs. Gabherly, that i is because I am so idle, that I do often feel
curious about things that nobody else seems to care about. Do you
know I am dying to get into a factory, and see all thesc dear little
children at work. It must be so pretty to see them all looking so
pnroud and so happy, and all enjoying themselves s much. I really
must get a peep at it,'' said Mliss Brotherton.
 Law. my dear1 What a very queer notion,'' replied Mrs. Gab-
berly.
 Perhaps it is,'' said Mary smiling, `` as nobody else in the whole
neighbourhood ever talks about it; but if I have such a fancy, there
can be no reason why I should not indulge i1, can there 2''
 WVhy, good gracious, my dear child only think of the dirnt1 You
would be downright poisoned, Mlary.''
Poisoned? How can that be, dear Mrs, Gabberly, when every
boly agrees that it is such a blessing to the country, to have brought
such multitudes of children to work together in these factories ?''
Nonsense, my dearl'' replied Mrs. Gabberly, knitting her brows.
e This is some of Mrs, Tremlett's vulgar ignorance, I am very sure.
How can a girl of your good understanding, Miss Brotherton, speak
as if what was good and proper for the working classes, had any thing
to do with such as you. Fie1 my dear1 Pray never let any body in
the neigbbourhood hear you talk in this strange wild way, I do assure
you, that there is nothing that would do you so much injury in the
opinion of all the first families hereabouts. hnd nobody knows this
neighbourhood better than 1 do.''
I am quite aware of that Mrs. Gabberly,'' said the young lady
very respectfully, `` and that is one reason why I wish to talk to you
about this notion of mine. Is it really true, Mrs. Gabberly, that none
of the ladies in the neighbourhood ever go into the factories ?''
 To be sure it is. Why should they go, for goodness sake2''
Oh1 I don't know exactly.-bBut I cannot see why they should
not-if they wish it,'' replied Miss Brotherton, modestly.
 WVell now, but I do, my dear. And I do beg and entreat that
you won't talk any more about it. I am quite sure, Mary, that some-
body or other has been talking nonsense to you, about all this. If you
had got any friends or connexions towards Fairly now, I should think
they had been telling you all the romantic stuff that has been hatch-
ing there about factory children, and God knows what beside. But I
don't believe you have eer gone visiting that way, have you, 
dear2'
And who is there at Fairly, dear Mrs. Gahberly, who would be

likely to talk to me on such a subject?'' snid MIary, colouring to the
temples, with eageruess to hear the answer.  Gool graciousl my
dear, did you never hear tell of that poor wrong-headed clergyman,
George HBeIl? Such a difference to be sure between one man and
another. Mly dear good Mr. Gabberly never in his lile breathel a
word that conld hurt the feelings of his neighbours. He visited thent
every one, and was on the best and most friendly terms with them all,
which is hat I call livsing in the true spirit of Christian charity.
Whereas this tiresome, troublesome, Mr. lBell, has taken it into his
heal to find out wrong, where every iody else sees nothing but right:
anl God forbid, my dear, that you should take it into your dear innocent
heal to follow any of his mischievous fancies;: I wonder what he'll
get by it? Great goose he must be, to be sure, not to see that he is
going exactly the way to set every body that can be of the least use to
him smack against himn in all things:''
WYlt is it he does, Mrs. Gaberly, that is so very wrong?'' de-
manded Miss Brotherton.
IYhat is it he does? Why just every thing he ought not to do,
my dear, that's all. You would hardly eliee, perhaps, that a cler-
gyman should actually encourage the poor to complain of the very
iabour by which they live And yet I give you my word and honour
that is exactly what he has been doing. It's incredible, isn't it, al-
most IIe positively says, loud enough for all the country to hear him,
that the labour in the factories-such a blessing as it is to tbe poor-
he actually says that it is bad for the children's health. Such stuff,
you know, my dear, as if the medical men did not know best; and
there's numbers of 'em that declare that it's quite impossible to tell in
any way satisfactory that it can do 'em any harmn at all. And, upon my
word, l1 dou't know what poor people will come to: It's quite out of
the question to attempt pleasing'em. If they've got no work they are
perfectly outragous about that, and realy to tear people to pieces just
to get it: and no sooner is there enough to do, than away they go
bawvling again, swvearing that the children are over-worked ; isn't it pro
voking my dear2''
 MIr. George Bell,'' said Mary, very distinctly.
 Yes, my dear, that's the name of the foolish man who seems to
take a pleasure in making people fancy they are not well enough ofl,
when 1'm sure, by all I can hear and understand, these very identical
people may consider theruselves first and foremost of the whole world
for prosperity,'' repliel Mrs. Gabberly.
Fairly 7'' rejoined MIiss Brotherton, interrogatively,
Yes, my dear, Fairly's wlere le lives, if I don't mistake.''
Good morning, Mrs. Gabberly,'' said the young lady, rising some-
what abruptly;  I am very glad you had such a pleisantdlay yesterday.
Good bye.'' And without permitting the stream of Mrs. Gabberly's
eloquence ta well forth upon her afresh, the heiress slipped through
the parlour door, and escaped.

To order the carriage. and to give Mrs. Tremlett naotice that she
wished her to make all speed in preparing to accompany her in it, was
to Miss HBrotherton the work of a moment. As the business she was
pon migbt, however, take some hours, she urgeil her old friend to eat
luncheon as if certain of having no dinner: and having given time for
this, and interrogated her coachman concerning distance and so forth,
the hopeful, animated girl, sprung iato her carriage as the clock struck
two, determinel not to rc-enter her mansion till she had lost some or-
tion of the ignorancee which had of late so cruelly tormented her.
The roads were good, and by the help of a short bait, Miss Brother-
ton and her companion reached Fairly turnpike a liule after four.
Here she made inquiries for the residence of MIr. Bell, and having
learned in what direction she should find it, repeated the instructions
to her coachman, and bade him drive on.
``Are the horses to be put up there, ma'am 2'' demanded the ceoach-
man.
:Yes-no, James, not there I suppose-that is, not at the clergy-
man's house; but of course you will be able to find some place quite
near, you know; and WVilliam must wait-no, not wait, but come baek
as soon as he knows where you put np, that l may send for you when I
am ready.''
To these, not over-clear, instructions James answered  Yes ma'am,''
and drove off.
In obedience to the directions received at the tollbar, the carriage
soon left thc high-road, and proceeded down a grassy lane, which
harvest carts for the time had rolled into smoothmness. Less than a
quarter of a mile of this, brought the wanderers to another turning,
that in five minutes placed them befaore the gates of an edifice the
aspect of which made Mary pull the check-string.
That looks like a parsonage-housel Does it not?'' said Miss
Bratherton.
And before MIrs. Tremlett could anser,WWilliam had alrealy opened
the door, and let down the steps. It was very easy to get out, and
very easy to inquire if Mr. Bell were at home; but when answered in
the affirmatie, Miss Brotherton feltthat it was not very easy to decide
in what manner to explain the cause of her visit to the object of it.
She had by no means settled this point to her satisfaction, when the
door of a small parlour, lined with ooks, was opened to her, and she
found herself in the presence of the gentleman she had so unceremo-
niously come to visit.

There was much in the countenance of Mr. Bell to reassure a more
timid spirit than that of Mary Brotherton; nevertheless she stood be-
fore him for a minute or two in some embarrassment, not so much from
fear of him, as of herself. Did she fail to make him at once under-
stand the motie of her inquiries, he could not avoid thinking both
themn and herself impertinent, and this consciousness caused a much
brighter glow than usual to mantle her cheeks, as she stood baefore
him, with her eyes fixed timidly, and almost beseechiagly, on his
face.
Althogh iss Drotherton had not quite the easy and (tant soit
peal assured air of a woman of fashion, there was enough in her
appcarance to indicate her claim to observance, as well as admiration,
and Mr. Bell opened the conversation by earnestly requesting that she
would sit down.
His aspect hadl done much towards giving her courage, and his
voice did more.
 You are very kind sir,'' sail she, `to receive so courteously a
stranger, who has in truth no excuse whatever to offer for thus intrud-
ing on you. Nevertheless, I am greatly tempted to hope, that if 1
can succeed in making you understand the object of my visit, you will
forgive the freedom of it.''
 And I,'' reurned Mr. Bell, smiling, ` am greatly tempted to be-
lieve that let the object of this visit be what it may, lI must always feel
grateful toit. Is there any thing, my ear young lady, that I can do ta
serve you 2''
t here is indeed, Mr. Bell I'' she repliel, with great earnestness of
voice and manner. `I am come to you for instruction. Though you
do not know me, you probnbly may know the place at which I live.
My name is Mary bBrotherton, and my house is called MilIford Park,''
Certainly, Miss Brotheron, hoth your name, and that of your
residencce are known to me-on what subject can l give you any in-
formition that may be useful ?''
 Circumstances, Mr. Bell, have lately directedt my attention to a
subject which my own situation in life, as well as the neighbourhood in
which I live ought to have long ago made thoroughly familiar to me-
such is not the case, however; I am profotundly, and 1 fear shamefully
ignorant respecting the ilarge and very important class of our popula-
tion employed in the factories. I am in possession of a large fortune
wholly amassed from the profits obtained by my father from this species
of labour, and I cannot but feel great interest in the welfare and pro-
sperity of the people employed in it-especially as lI understand a very
large proportion of them are young children-and moreover, that
from some cause or other, which I can by no means understand, the
whole class of' the factory people,' as I hear them called, are spoken
of with less kindness and respect by those who hae grown rich upon
their industry, than any other description of human beings whateer.
I am told, sir, that it would be aunsafe, inpropner, and altogether rong
were l to attempt making myself personally acquainted with them, as
I would wish to do-and having accidentally, Mr. Bell, heard your
200
TE LIRE AND ADYExTURES
name mentioned as a person who took an interest in their concerns, I
have cone to you thus unceremonionsly, in the hope that you would
have the kindness to give me more accurate information on the subject,
than I have found it possible to obtain elsewhere.''
Mr, Bell, who had placed himself immediately opposite to her, looked
in her young face, and listened to her earnest voice as she spoke, with
the deepest attention. It soon became sufficiently clear that he con-
sidered not this intrusion as requiring apology, but that on the con-
trary his very heart and soul were moved by her words. Hc paused
for a moment after she had ceasel speaking, as if unwilling to inter-
rupt her by his reply; but when he found that she remained silent, he
said,
 The subject on which you are come to converse with me, my dear
MIiss IBrotherton, is assredly the very last I should have expected to
hear named by a young lady in your position-for it is one from which
the rich and great of our district turn away with loathing and contempt.
Yet is it the one of all others to which I would if possible direct their
best attention, involving as it does both their interest and their duty be-
yond any other. But I fear I cannot enter upon it without wounding
many prejndices which of necessity you must have imbibed, and prov-
ing to you tbat much which doubtless you have been educated to con-
sider right, is on the contrary most lamentably wrong. Can you bear
this my dear young lady 3'
 I hope I could, in a search alter truth, Mr. Bell, even if my mind
were in the condition you suppose,'' replied Mary.  But this is not
the case. kou will not have to remove many false impressions I think.
-It is the total absence of all knowledlge on the subject, which I am
bold enough to ask you to remedy.'
 And most willingly will I endeavsour to do so, to the very best of
my ability,'' replied MIr. Bell.-: But to me it is a beguiling subject,
and if I detain you too long, you must tell me so.''
 Fear not,'' replied MIary, smiling. :: I shall be more willing to
hear, than you to speak.''
t You are of course aware, MIiss Brotherton,'' resumed the clergy-
man, ` that the large proportion of young labourers to whom you have
just alluded, are calculated to amount, in Yorkshire and ancashire
alone to upwards of two hundred thousand.''
Is it possibhle ?' exclaimed Mary,  Alas1 Mr. Bell you must not
think that' of course' I know any thing-had you named two thousand
as the number, my surprise would have been less.''
 But so it is, Mliss Brotherton. Above two hundred thousand young
creatures, including infants among them, counting only five years of
life, are thus employed in the counties I have named; and they surely
form a class, which both from their numbers, and their helplessness are
entitled to English sympathy and protection ?''
 UnquestionablyI'' cried Mary, eagerly,  I always feel that the
labouring poor hae great and nnceasing claims upon the sympathy
and assistance of the rich.-Dut this claim must be equally great l
o ICHAEL ARMTnONG.
201
should suppose amongst all the labouring classes. Is it not, Mr.
Be:
:I feel it difficult to answer your question by a negative,'' he re-
plied, `` becuse, taken in its broadest sense, it most assuredly demands
an affirmative. Nevertheless it is unquestionably true that at this
moment there is no rnce of human beings in ahny portion of the known
world-the most wretched of negro slaves not excepted, Mliss IBrother-
ton-who require the protection and assistance of their happier fellow-
creatures, in the same degee as the young creature eployed in our
factories,''
Miss Brotherton looked at him, not doubtingly, but with consider-
able surprise, and timidly replied, `: But the negro slave, Mlr. Bell, has
no choice left him-he is the property of his master,''
 Neither has the factory child a choice, Miss Brotherton. He toa
is a property; nor is it the least horrible part of the evil which noise-
lessly has grown out of this tremendous system, that the beings whom
nature has ordained throughout creation to keep watch and ward over
the helpless weakness of infant life, are driven by it to struggle with,
and trample down the holiest and dearest of human ties-even the love
of a parent for its offsring. Picture to yourself a bleak winter's morn-
ing, Mliss Brotherton, when the mother of factory children must be up
hours and hours hefore the sun to rouse her half-rcsted little ones:; and
nervously watching her rude clock till the dreaded moment comes, mst
shake the litle creatures, whose slumber the very beast of the field
might teach her to watch over and gnard, till they awake, and starting
in terror from their short sleep, ask if the hour be come? Thc wretched
mother, and the wretched child then vie with each other in their trem-
bling haste to seize the tattered mill-clothes, and to put them on. The
moter dreads the fine of one quarter of the infant's laily wages, which
would be levied, shonld it arrive but a minute too late, and the poor
child dreads the strap, which, in addition, is as surely the punishment
for delay. Miss Brotherton, I hae seon with my own eyes the as-
sembling of some hundreds of factory children before the still unopened
doors of their prison-house, while the lingering darkness of a winter's
night had yet to last three hours. I shall ncver forget one bitter morn-
ing, last January twelvemonthl The last piteous summons froma
dying parishioner had left me no choice but to exchange my pillow for
the bitter biting blast aof Howley- common, and the path across it lead-
ing me within a hundred yards of a large cotton-factory, I witnessed a
spectacle, which to my dying day I shall never recall without a shud-
der: There was just moon cnough to show me all the dreary sternness
of the scene.-The ground was covered deep with snow, and a cutting
wind blew whistling through the long line of old Scotch firs wvhich
bordercd an enclosure beside theroad. As I scudded on beneath them,
my eye caught the liutle figures of a multitude of chilren, made dis-
tinctly visible, even by that dim light, by the strong relief in which their
dark garments showed themselves against the snow. A few steps
further brought me in full view of the factory gates, and then I per-
ceived considerably above two hundred of thcse miserable little victims

rE LIFE AND ADYxURES
together under the potent inspiration of the overlooker's strap. Then
comes a state of deeper degradation still. The father is idle, for often
he can get no work, and it is to the labour of his little ones that he
looks for bread. Nature recoils from the spectacle of their unnatural
o'erlaboured aspect as they return from their thirteen, fourteen, fif-
teen, hours of toil. He has not nerve to look upon it, and creeps to
the gin-shops till they are hid in bed. The mother sees it all, and
sternly screws her courage to the task of lifting their bruised and
weary limbs upon their bed of straw, putting into their mouths the food
she has prepared, their weary eyes being already closed in sleep, and
preparing herself to wake before the sun on the morrow, that with un-
relenting hand she may drag them from their unfinished slumber, and
drie them forth again to get her food. This is no varnished tale, MIiss
Brotherton, but the bare, naked, hideous truth. And can you wonder
that beings thus reared and ripened should form a degraded class
Can you wonder that all others should turn froms them, as from a race
with whom they have nothing in common? If some sad accident,
preceding birth, disturbs the beautiful process by which nature prepares
the noble being she has made to be lord of all, and an abortive crea-
ture comes to life, curtailed of all its fair proportions, both of mind
and body, all within reach of the hapless prodigy shudder as they
mourn, and the best and wvisest among them pray to God that its span
of life be short. lBut believe me when I tell you, MIiss bBrotherton,
that the effect which the factories of this distric is producing upon
above two hundred thousand of its population, is beyond all calcula-
tion more deplorable, and many a child is born amongst them whose
destiny, if fairly weighed against that of such aone as l have described,
would appear incomparably more terrible.''
Can such things be, and the rulers of the land sit idly by to wit-
ness it?'' cried Mary shuddering.
It seems as if the rulers of' the land knew little, and cared less
about it,'' replied MIr. Bell.  The profoundly ignorant opinion that
there is some connexion between our national prosperity, and the
enormous fortunes amassed by some score of North-country manufac-
turers has, I beliere, produced much of the lamentable non-interfer-
ence of which the disinterested few complain, who are near enough
to look upon the frightful game. Some individual voices have been
most gloriously raised on this tremendous theme, and if they will
be steadfast and enduring, they must and will prevail-for human na-
ture, with all its vices, is not framed to look coldly on sch horrors,
and permit them. But the remedial process is so slow-it is so diffi-
cult to arouse the attention, and awaken the feelings of busy men con-
cerning things at a distance, whose connexion with all that they deem
important they are too ignorant of, or too preoccupied to trace, that the
keenest observers, and those who would the most deeply deprecate any
remedy but a legal one, begin to fear that mercy will be clamoured for
with very dangerous ruleness, before the parliament of England shall
have roused up its wisdom to the task of affording it.
:And in what way, Mr. Bell, is it wished, or hoped, that the legis-
oR IIICHAEL ARMSTOG.
20b
lature should step forward to cure this dradful evil? Is it proposed
to abolish the use of machinery t''
Mr, Bell smiled, and shook his head.
You perhaps think,'' said he, `` that there is a great disproportion
between my strong sense of the vice and suffering produced by the
factory system, and the measure for its mitigation to which I now limit
almost my wishes. But it would be vain to look back to the time when
steam engines were not, and there would indeed be little wisdom in
addressing our lamentations to their introduction. It is not the acqui-
sition of any natural power, principle, or faculty, that we should de-
plore; all such, on the contrary, should be hailed as part and parcel
of our magnificent birthright, and each new use we learn to make of
the still much-unknown creation around us, ought to be welcomed with
a shout of praise, as a fresh fulfilment of the supreme command
' replenish the earth and subdue it' It is not from increased, or in-
creasing science that we have any thing to dread, it is only from a
fearfully culpable neglect of the noral power that should rule and re-
gulate its uses, that it can be other than one of God's best gifts.''
But how,'' demanded Mary, `` how, if machinery continues to be
used, can any Act of Parliament prevent the necessity of employing
children to wait upon its operations instead of requiring the strength
of' men, as heretofore, to perform what the steam-engine does in their
place ?''
 No Act of Parliament can be conceived capable of inducing a
manufacturer to emnploy the weaker, and at the same time the more
costly agent, in preferenee to a more powerful and cheape one,'' re-
plied MIr. Bell. ` No reasonable man would ask this, no rea-
sonnble man would desiro it, and assuredly no reasonable man
would attempt to enforce such an absurdity by law. No, Miss Bro-
therton, this mighty power, as surely given for our use as is the
innocent air that fans the woodbine yonder, has at length, after
some few thousand years of carcless overlooking on our part been
revealetd to us. But let us not fly in the faco of benignant nature,
and say like Caliban,
 You taught me langage ; and my profit on't
Is, I kow how to curse'
If used aright the recannot be a doubt that this magnificent power
might, in all its agencies, be made the friend of man. Ite requires no
great stretch of ingenuity to conceive that it might be rendered at oncae
a source of still increasing wealth to the capitalist, and o lightened
labour to the not-impoverished operative. But that, as things are at
present, this great discovery, and all the amirable ingenuity with
which it is applied, acts as a ban instead of a blessing upen some
hundred thousands of miserable victims is most true, while all the benefit
that can be shown as a balance to this horror, is the bloated wealth of
a small knot of master-manufacturers. But so monstrous is this evil,
that its very atrocity iospires hope, from the improbability that when
once beyond all reach ol contradiction its existence shall be known
by all men, it should be permitted to continue.''

of the orlinary modes of being useful on a larger scale, such as
organising schools, founding benefit societies, or the like, could be of
any use to beings sa crushed, so toil-worn, and so degraded, it would
be idle to hope.''
Miss Brotherton now rose to depart-but as she extended her hand,
and began to utter her farewell, it occurred to her that it was possible
her new friend might, by cojecture at least throw some light upon the
destination of little Michael, and avoiding as much as possible the
making any direct charge against her rich ncighbour, she briefly nar-
rated the facts of Michael's adoption, dismissal, and unknown desti-
nation, with little commentary on either, but concluded by saying,
The mnother of the child is in great anxiety about him, and though
lI cannot coneeive it possible any harm can have hefallen the boy, l am
in some sort a fellow-sufferer with her in the anxiety which this
mystery occasions, from having almost pledged myself to learn the
place of his destination. Can you, dear sir, suggest to me any means
by wbich this information can be obtainel?''
 Some part of this history has reached us already,'' replied Mr.
Bell. `` It has heen somewhat industriously bruited through the neigh-
bourhood, that Sir Matthew Dowling, notoriously one of the most
tyrannical millocrats in the whole district, has been moved to kindness
in behalf of somne poor widow's son, and taken him to be reared and
educated with his own children-l trust I am excusable, knowing what
I know, for misdoubting the disinterested benevolence of any act of
Sir Matthew Dowling's. Nevertheless it is certainly not easy to pec-e
ceive why, after having so ostentatiously distinguished the boy, he should
kidnap him, as it were, from his own house, in order to get rid of him.
If, instead of being the object ot especial faour, the little fellow had
fallen under the rich knight's displeasure, Miss IBrotherton, I should
think it by o means improbable that he might have consigned him as
an apprentice to some establishment, too notorious for its severity to
make it desirable that his selection of it should be made known. But
of this there seems neither proof nor likelihood,''
Mliss Brotherton tured pale as she listened to tbhis suggestion.
Nay, but there is both truth and likelihood in such a suspicion,'' she
exclaimed with considerable emotion, and alter a moment's considera-
tion, added, ` I know no reason why l should conceal the cause I have
for saying s-if you know not all, how can you give me counsel2''
Iiurriedly, and as briefly as possible, Mliss Drotherton then recounted
the scene she had witnessed in the green-room of the Dowling-
lodge theatricals, but there was an unconscious and involuntary fer-
vouir in her manner of narrating it, which rendered it impossible to listen
with indifference, or not to feel at the recital some portion of the in-
dignation she had felt when it occurred.
 It must be looked to, Mliss Brotherton,'' replied her warm-hearted
new acquaintance.  he boy must be traced, tracked, found, and
rescued. I think there are few of these wretched prison-hbouses of
whose existence I am ignorant, and it is probable l may be able to
help yu in this. Should I obtain auy hint likely to be useful in the

bad ones in his commercial enterprises. The high-minded owners of
yonder factory arelosing thousands every year by their efforts to purify
this traflic of its enormities-and some thousand small still voices cnll
down blessings on them for it. But while it costs them ten shillings
to produce what their neighbours can bring into the market for nine,
they will only he pointed at as pitiably unwise in their generation by all
the great family of Mammon which surrounds them. Few, alas1 will
think of following the example. All they can do therefore is in fact
but to carry on a system of nrivate charity on an enormous scale-but
till they are supported by law, even their vast efforts, and most noble
sacrifices can do nothing towards the general redemption of our poor
northern people from the state of slavery into which they have fallen.
And yet I do believe, Miss Brotherton,'' he continued, after a pause,
1I do most truly believe that these greedy tyrants would fail more
rarely than now they do in their efforts to realize enormous wealth, if
the system were to undergo exactly the change we ask for. The plan
of under-selling may indeed in some few instances enahle a very lucky
man to run up a blool-stained fortune: and blood-stained it must be,
for whenever this method of commanding a sale is pursued, and ruin
doces NoT ensue, it is demonstrable that the bones and marrow of chil-
dren, working unlimited hours, must have been the main agent in the
operation. But it is quite certain that the underselling system mst
upon the long run be ruinous. If all the losses upon our production
were fairly set against all the gains from the immoderate working. of
young hands, the slavery scheme would appear as little prolitable as
holy. But here is your carriage, my dear young lady : God bless you:
and may we live to rejoice together over an effectual legislative remedy
for the evils we have passed this our first interview in deploring l''
So saying, he extended his hand to assist her into the carriage which
had already drawn up beside them-but Miss Brotherton stepped aside
while he performed this office to her friend, and then laying her hand
on his arm, drew him back a step or too to the spot from whence the
factory chimneys he had pointed out to her were visible.
 Tell me, before we part,'' she said, ' the names of those to whom
that building belongs?''
 WooD x Wxn,'' replied the clergyman.
 Thank you'' che replied; `` I shall never hear those names with-
out breathing a blessing on themI''
Friendly farewells ware once more exchanged, and thie melitative
heiress was driven baek to Millford-park in silenco so psofound, that
her old friend believed her to be asleep, and carefully ahstained from
any movement that might awaken her. But Mary Brotherton was not
asleep.

TtE moment at which Michael Arnstrong entered the cotton mill
at Deep Valley, was a criticalone. The summer had been nore than
commnonly sultry, and a large order had kept all hands very sbarply at
work. Even at dead of night the machinery was never stopped, and
when one set of fainting children were dragged fcom the mules another
set were dragged from the reeking beds they were about to occupy, in
order to tske their places. Theventilation througlout the whole fabric
was exceedingly imperfect; the heat, particularly in the rooms im-
mediately beneath the rool, frightfully intense: cleanliness as to the
beds, the floors, and the walls, utterly neglected: and even the persons
of the clildren permitted to be filthy to excess, from having no soap
allowed to assist their ablutions-though from the greasy nature of their
employment it was peculiarly required, while the coarse meal oc-
casionally given out to supply its place wasinvariably swallowed, being
far too precious in the eyes of the hungry children to be applied to the
purpose for which it wasdesigned. In addition to all this, the food was
miserably scanty, and of a nature so totally uufit to sustuin the strength
of growing children thus severely worked, that within a fortnight after
MIichael's arrival, an epidemic fever of a very alarming description be-
gan to shew itself., But it had made considerable progress, before the
presence of this new horror was revealed to him.
Notwithstanding all the hardships of Brookford factory, no infec-
tious disease had ever appeared there, which it is possible might have
been owing to the fact that the majority of the lahourers in it lived at a
considerable distance, thus insuring to them a walk morning and mght,
through the fresh air. This, tlough it added to their daily fatigue.
prohably lessened the danger of it, while the wretched hovels to which
they returned for their short night's rest, miserable shelters as they
were, reeked not with the congregated effluia of fifty uncleansed
sleepers in one chamer1 MIichael, therefore, had never before wit-
nessed the hideous approach of contagion. The general appeaeranee
too of the Deep Valley troop was so far from healthy, that the sickly
aspect of those first seized upon was less remarkable than it wonld.
have heen elsewhere. Thus another week wore away, during which,
though seweral of those who had been working when it began were
withdrawn, and known to be in the sick-wvard ere it closed, the fact
that an infectious fever was among them hal not yet got wing.
 Poor dear Betsy Price:'' whispered Fanny Fletcher to her friend
MIichael, as they sat side by side at their miserable dinner one day.
l heard missis tell master that she was dead. lBut I am trying to be
glad for t lichael.''

liked her more than any other girl in the mill, and now you are glad
she is dead '
I am not so glad as I think I ought to be,'' returned Faany
gently. ` She will not be hungry in Heaven, Michael, nor will she
work till she isrealy to fall: and surely God will give us green fields
and sweet fresh air in Heaven, and there mnst be fiowers, Michael.
Oh1 I am quite sure of that, and Betsy Price will have it all1 Ought
I not to e very, very, glad2'
lichael looked in her sweet, innocent face, as she said this, and
tears filled his eyes.
An if you die, Fanny, must I be glad too 3'
If ou thought about Heaven as 1 do, and if you loved me very
nuch indeed,'' replied the little girl, `1 can't tell how yon could help
being glad.''
ButI do love you very much indeel,'' said Michael, almost choked
by his efforts not to cry, ``andl I do think of Heave, too, Fanny, but
I could'nt be glad if you was to die:''
Not when you hear that, Michael I'' said Fanny, starting up as the
lash of the governor's whip resounded through the room as a signal
that their numbered moments of rest were over.  I suppose then I
love you better than youlove me, for. I could not help being glal if I
knew that you would never hear nor feel that lash again 1''
When they met again at suppcr, Michael, though still unsuspicious
of the cause, missed three more children from their places. He fan-
cied, too, that there was something new and strange in the aspect of
their hard-featured female tyrant; she was paler than usual, scolded
not at all, and when she spoke to her husband, it was in a voice that
hardly exceeded a whisper. Yet, notwithstanding this, some young
ears again caught words that told of death. Yet still the mill worked
n, and nothing seemed to mark that any calamity more than usual
had got among them.
y degrees, however, the growing pestilence burst forth, as it were,
before the eyes of the terrified children, and they knew that the grave
yawned before them all. Then it was that the ghastdy countenances of
each doomel victim struck dismay into the hearts of their companions
even hefore they were permitted to leave their labour, and sink down
to the rest that shoull he disturbed no more. But still the mill went
n, for Mr. Llgood Sharpton hal just received a glorious order from
Russia, and it woull have been perfect madness, as this gentlemnen was
heard to remark to his eldest son, if a death or two among the appren-
tice children was to check the mill at such a time as that.
So the mill went on, and death went on too. But as it is considered
by all parties concerned to be extremely important that the cry of
epidemic contagion should not be raised in the neighbourhood of a
actory under these circumstances, it wvas deemed best by Mr. Elgood
Sharpton, and his confidential managers, not to call in medical assist-
ance.
For first and foremost, Poulet,'' said the experienced proprietor to
the goernor of the apprentice house, `` tirst and foremost, it is of

TEE LIFE AND ADVENTLRE8
only one or two such thougthful, meditativse litule things, as Fanny
Fletcher, who had began to remember having heard of infectious
fevers, and to think that maybe it was something of that sort that had
made Nos. 9, 16, 18, 19. &c., &c., stay away so long, and thal too,
when the mill was so very busy.
lBut when it became generally known that the awful strength of MIrs.
Poulet was laid low, and when the words, `` the fever have cautched
her1'' had once heen pronounced aloud, the palpable image of the pale
tyrant seemed to stand frowning in the midst of them, substituting his
grisley hour-glass and scythe for the fist, and the frown he had con-
quered.
The scene which followed this was very frightful.-Those upon whom
infeection had seized, sunk from their work at once, despite the goading
thong which had hitherto kept them from dropping-as the spur and
the lash sustain the failing post-horse. While those who were yet un-
touched looked in each other's faces as if to watch who next should
fall. When the children from all the different floors of the fabric met
together at their midday meal, the first thought of each seemed to be
the finding out who was missing sinee last they assembled, and the
shuder that followed the perceiving another and another, and another
gone, ran along the shortening lines with an agony which grew more and
more intense as their numbers lessened.
When things had reached this state, Mr. Elgood Sharpton agrced
with Mr. Poulet that it might perhaps be as well to let an apothecary
from Tugswell visit the factory, to which reluctant decision two reasons
strongly contribnted. The first was, that though with his usual fore-
thought he had divided his noctnrnal buryings between the churchyards
of Tugswell and Meddington, the clergymen of both had declarcd that
their frequency rendered it necessary that some inquiry should be made
into the cause of so great a mortality-and the second was that the
fact of the mistress of the apprentice house, being herself at the point
of death from the same malady, must infallibly prove to the medical
visitant that it was no ireatment peculiar to the children which hed oc-
casioned it, but that it had come beyond all possibility of contradiction
by the visitation of Gol.
Nevertheless the medical gentleman ventured to declare that nothing
would be so likely to stop the contagion as nourishing food; upon
which the terrified manufacturer astonished all the butchcrs within his
reach, by commanding a large supply of beef and mntton ``geod
eneug to make holesome soup,'' and before another ghastly week had
passed away, the wisdom of this prescription became so evident that
when settling accounts togcther at the end of it, MIr. Poulet hinted to
his employer that he did not feel quite sure whether upon the whole a
little better living for the apprentices might not pay.
For all answer Mr. Elgood Sharpton pu his finger to the sum total
for provisions during the last week, and then turning back a page or
two of the huge volume, did the same hy the sum total of a tormer
week.
 True, sir, true enough,'' said Mr. Poulet, ` but howsomever it
o ICIAIL ARI9TOHG.
217
can't be denied, that if we go on this fashion we shall have no hands
left to work with-and therc would be but small profit in that sir.''
My dear Poulet, you do not study the population returns as at-
tentively as I do,'' replied his enlightened master.  Just at this
lOment it may be very right to cram them for several reasons-the
best being, observe, that by so doing we stop more mouths than thcir
own. But as to going on in the same style of expense when this fit of
dying and gossiping is over, it is quite oute of the question, and I do
bcg tlat you will never mention the subject to me again. You can
know littlc my gool Poulet of the rate at which paupcr children are
multiplied, if you think it nccessary to preserve them at this ruinous
rate of expence. If there were all of them to die off before the end of
the monthi, l would undertake to have their place supplied belore the
end of the next. You may take my word for it that no man ever suc-
ceeded in business who did not know how to nake out an accurate
balance between profit and loss. I know to a fraction what each of
thcse 'prentice brats are worth, Poulet, and I can tell you that such
weekly bills as these would spcedily turn the tables agaiast us.''
 In that case, sir,' there is surely no orc to be said,'' replied
Poulet: and then changing the subject, he added, '` In course, sir,
ou won't object to my missis being buried by day, instend of by night :
Besides respect to her, sir, I think it would be quite as wcll, shewing
all the country, you see, as how flesh is but grass for the high, as for
the low, and making it manifest to all the country that it can't be no
want of good nursing and comfort as causes the deaths at our mill,''
 Quite right, quite right, Poulet,'' replied the rapid-mindel Mr.
Sharpton, promptly; ` I hould not object even to stopping the mills
for a couple of hours or so, and making all the hands follow as
mourers, iI you thought it would anser.''
 WVhy, as to that, sir,'' said the faithful servant, ` I would not un-
dertake to say that we should be able to get up much of a procession
if we turned out the whole lot to choose from. They couldn't stand l
should think, sir, without the mules to hold by, for so long togethcr.
They totter frightful, I can tell you, when they starts first to move ts
and fro, from factory to 'prentice-house, and back again, and I don't
think there would be either credit or profit in making a show of them.''
 Well, well1 do as you will, Ponlet. I dont care a brass farthing
whethcr they walk or stand; and I can't say when I built this factory,
it was with any view to make a show, as you call it, of the young
lalies and gentlemen to be employed in it''
Wih a light laugh which challenged an answering laugh from
the governor, widowcr as hc was, Mr. Elgood Sharpton rose to depart.
Poulet attended him to the outer gate, and held his stirrup while he
mountcl, reiterating his promises to do tle bUest he could, and only
stipulating for plenty of vinegar, and leavse to use soap till the cold
weather came in.
Mcanwhile, though a less proportion iliei of those who were seized
with the malady, than before the improvement in tha diet was intro-
duced, the plague was as yet very far from being stayed. No day

It was an established custom among those who alone could give infor-
mation on the subject, never to permit any questionings concerning the
sick, or if they were boldly hazarded, to give no other reply than a re-
buke. So that day after day, and week after week elapsed, without her
being at all able to guess, whether Mlichael were dead or alie. By de-
grees, however, all hope of seeing him return, faded from her mind, and
then, poor little girl, she found out that people can't always wish
truly and really for what they know to be best either for themselves or
others. And day by day, though still the fever touched her not, she
grew more pale, more thin, more melancholy. Now and then, indeed,
it still occurred to her as possible that Michael might reappenr again, as
many had done after many days of sickness; but, alas: none hatd eer
staid away so long as he had donel She had questioned many who
had been ill concerning him, but none seemed to know or care any
thing about those who hal shared the sick chamber with them; till at
length, a boy to whom she had oflen addressed these questions, be-
cause she happened to know that he had been taken to the sick ward
on the same day as Michsel, replied as if by a sudden effort of recol-
lection,
Oh  that chap? lHim what was one of the last as come? Ay, ay, I
mind all about him. He was dead and buried before he had been
down three days.''
Fanny Fletcher askel no more questions, nor ha she any longer
hope of tollowmng where so many of her happier companions were gone.
The fever was pronounced to be over, the Factory and Apprentice-
house were whitewashed, and a number of new inmates arrived. AI]
things in short at the Deep-Valley Mills appeared to be going on as
presperously as usunl; a statement which could be hardly impeached
by the fact that one little girl there was growing paler and more sha-
dow-like every day.

tete-d-tte with Miss Brotherton, after their return from Fairly,
9 don't you think that you will come at last to confess that l was right
when I told you that you had better let things alone, and not attempt
to make any fuss or stir about these factory goings on ?''
Mnry looked sick at heart, and only shook her head in reply
 Why, what have you gained, my dear child, by all your labour and
220
TE LIFE AND ADYENTURES
pains to get information, as you call it? You are looking as white as
a sheet-your eyes are sunk in your head-when I look at you, instead
o the smiles you used to give me, I get nothing but sighs, and all for
what  Can you in honesty and truth say that you have gained any
thing worth knowing by following your own opoion instead of mine?
WVhat good in the world can you do, dear, by listening to all the
shocking stories that clergyman there told ou? I dare say he is a vcry
good man, and he looks like it, but upon my word I think he is doing
othing but just wasting his time, as well as yourself; for though 1 sat
and said notbing, as of course it was my place to do, I listened to
every word, and it is just because I believe every word was true, that
common sense makes me see there's no good to tulk about it. In-
deed, and indeed, my darling, J would not make free to talk to you in
this way, which looks for all the world as if I was taking advantage of
yor goodness to me, if I did not see that you was ging the way to
torment yourself for everlasting, without doing one bit of good to any
one. For how, my dear, can you, or that good clergyman either, hope
to put down all the wicked doings he toldabout ? And to be sure he
said as much himself-didn't he Miss Mar? Then do make up your
mind to be quiet and happy, and let things tbhat you can't mend, alone.
Put as many children to school as yon like, my lear, and you may
givse them a prettyneat uniformn, you know, and that will be a pleasure
ior you to think about, and to look at; but for pity's sake my dear,
dear, child1 give up at once, anl for ever, this bothoring yourself for
everlasting about thc factories, which you can no more stop, Mary,
than you can stop the snn from rising in the morning, and setting at
night.'
Here thc good woman ceased, and looked with some anxiety in the
thoughtfl eyes of her young mistress. She felt that she did not un-
derstand thcir expression, and no wonder, for MIary IBrotherton her-
self sat silently doubting how she should answer her. A languid
tceling, proccediag partly ftrom atigue and indisposition, and partly
from the discouraging conviction that she had no very satisfactory ar-
guments by which to rebut her old friend's charge of useless devotion
to a hopless cause, made her for some minutes unwilling to speak at
all. Then came a somcwbhat peevish wish to interdict for ever the
discussion of the subject between them; but as she raised her eyes to
utter it, she encountered a look of such humble love, deprecating her
displeasure, yet fondly clinging to the freedom which risked the incur-
ing it, that her purpose suddenly changed, and instead of the chilling
command she was meditating, she threw hcr arms round the old
woman's neck, exclaiming,
eOh ? my dear nursel  IIow much, how very much you must loe
mel since care for my already too-much-cared-for peace and quiet,
can harden such a heart as yours towards all the suflerings we have
this day heard recountedt''
Thank God you are not angry,'' cried the affectionate old womahn
kissing her, and then arranging the neglected ringlets of her nretty
charge, and looking cheerily in her face, she said, ` Now then, hMary,
o MIICIAL ARMISrnONG.
221
I won't teaze you any more about it. You are so sweet and so gentle
to me, that lI am quite sure you will not long think my heart is hard;:
an then by degrees you will find out that l am right; and then all
will go well again, and 1 shall see my dear girl look like herself once
mare.''
` Nurse Tremlettl the time is already come when the impossibility of
my elfforts being of any avail to stem the torrent with which avarice and
cruelty are overwhelming the land, is made evident to me. So much,
dear nurse, I concede to you, and therefore on that point we will argue
no more. But, my dear old woman, have patience with me if I tell
yon that there are some points on which my reading may have given
mne, young as I am, as much, or cven more information than your ex-
perience has given you. You have heard of the slave trade, nurse
Tremlett-you have heard more than one excellent charity sermon
preached in aid of the funds that were to assist in freeing these poor
helpless black people from the tyranny of their masters, and I suppose
you know that it is now unlawful to bny and sell these poor creatures.
And how do you think this happy change in their favour has been
bronght abont?''
`By tbe king and the parliament, Miss Mary, makiag that most
good and righteous law,'' replied nurse Tremlett.
`'And how were they persuaded to make that law, think you?'' de-
manded Mary.
21 can't tell how that was brought about, my dear. I suppose it
was because they saw that it was right and f6t.''
1t was brought about, nurse Tremlett, by the voices of the people
of England, which were for years raised quietly, and with no breach of
law or order, but with patient and unshrinking perseveranee against this
great sin, till the lengthened ery could be no longer resisted, and the
law they perseverinlgy askel for, was granted to them. Do you think,
nurse Tremlett, that if during these years of orderly, but steady re-
monstrance, every Englishman and woman had acted upon the prin-
ciple you recommnend, and had turned their thoughts and their
conversation from the subject of negro slavery, because cach one
knew that he or she individually possessedno power to stop it. Do
you think that if such ad been the system acted upon, England would
now have to boast of having abolished this most wicked traffc ?'
: Perhaps not, my dear. I think I understand you now,'' replied
the honest-hearted old woman, eagerly.
eThen now my dear old friend we shall, I think, never have any
more disputes upon this subject. You-lI-every servant in my house
-every actquaintance I have in the world, may aid and assist in putting
an end to this most atrocious factory system, wct oor o wEIGII

iew she wished for, without paying for it the penalty of such a visit.
She wrote as follows:
MIy dear Miss MIartha,
I trust you are too goodnatured to be angry with me, even if
you should think that I am taking a great liberty with you. But the
truth is, that I much wish for the pleasure of seeing you, and yet am
too idle this morning to venture upon a drive. WVill you then have the
great kindness to pass the morning with me here? I send my car-
riage, lest Lady Dowling should not have one at leisure to send with
you.
2Believe me, my dear Miss Martha,
 Yours very sincerely,
MARY BRounox,''
Having written, folded, and sealed this epistle, Mary recollected that
it would be impossible to send it for at least four hours, and she smiled
first, and then sighed, as sho thought of the restless but useless aetivity
which had caused her so needlessly to forestall her usual hour of
rising. It would, in truth, have heen better for her, poor girl, could
she have slept through the time, for her waking thoughts had little that
was pleasant to rest upon. Een the commeneement of Edward's
studies, to which she had before looked forward with great delight, now
recurred to her only to bring the recollection that if she saw him, his
thoughts would be neither of his new clothes nor his new books, but of
Michael, and of her promise to get tidings of him. For his sake, and
her own too, she determined at least to escape this interview, feeling
that it would be etter for all parties that no tidings should be de-
livered to both mother and son at once, which could be done after his
school hours, by her driving to Hoxley-lane, after she had taken Martha
home.
In pursuance of this resolution, she walked to the school-house,
renewed her orders that the greatest attention should be paid to the new
scholar, Eward Armstrong, and care taken that if he were found back-
ward for his age, he should neither be laughed at nor chid. She then
left a message for him, stating that she should be engaged all the
morning, hut would see him at his mother's house, after he lef
school.
At eleven o'clock Miss Brotherton's equipage set of for Dowlirg
lodge, earing her letter to Martha, and the interval till its returr as
an anxious one. First she felt doubtful if hor unusual invitation
would be acceptcd; and if it were, she felt more doubful stilil as to
the nature of the scene which must follow. Nothing short of her
earnest wish to redeem her pramisc to Ms. Armstrong could have given
MIary cournge to do what she now meditated.
She entertained not the slightest doubt of the intrinsic excellence of
Martha Dowling. All she had ever seen of hen and still more, all she
had heard from the Armstrongs, convinced her of this; and to pain
her therefore, particularly in that most tender point, the exposure of

`But good gracious I'' retorted Miss Arabella, why might not any
other of us do as well? It would seem so much more natural in such
an elegant and fashionable gil as she is.''
`She is afraid of us, IBella,'' replied Miss Harriet, tittering.
fSir MIatthew, who had not only read the note, but contrived to hear
all that his two eldest daughters said concerning it, here burst into a
laugh.
Set n thief to catch a thief-hey: Harriet? Come Marthal start
awayl You have finished your breakfast long ago. I won't have the
carriage kept waiting''
 Must I go, papa?'' said poor Martha, turning very pale.
Must you go2 and with that die-away look too? Why, Martha.
are you jealous, because some folks fancy that the young lady wants
to make friends with you, for more reasons than one ?''
I would a great deal rather not go papal'' replied Martha in a
beseeching accent.
 Martha. I shall bein a dowuright passion with you in halfa miuute.
Upon my honour I never heard any thing so cross-grained and unsisterly
in my life. Go this moment, and get on your honnet, and remember if
you please, from first to last, to speak of your brother as a sister ought
to speak. And if she hints any thing about his having flirted a liutle
with Carry Thompson, be sure to say that he only did it to laugh at
her.'
As he spoke these words, Sir Matthew rose from the table, as if to
accelerate the novement which was to send her off,
Martha listened to him with the habitual reverence which she ever
bestowed on all he uttered; but shook her head, as it seemed, involun-
tarily, as he concluded.
WVhy you don't mean to say he was in earnest, you good-for-
nething spiteful girl1'' cried Iady Dowling, suddenly rousing herself
from the dignified apathy in which she usually indulged.
 WVhat a shame l'' cried one sister.
 That's too bad:'' cried the other.
 Just like her, though l'' sneered Mr. Augustus.
tHold your tongues, all of you,'' said Sir Matthew, :`I know
Martha better than any of ye, trust me for that, and what I bid her
do, that she will do, and nothing else. Run away Martha. Don't
mind any of 'em.''
Tus urged, thus goaded to the interview she dreaded, Martha
hastened to leave the room; but ere she passel the door, something at
her heart told her that her best course would be to take her father
aast, and tell him all. She turned ack to look at him, bt met a
frow so strongly indicative of groing impatience at her delay, that
yielding to the sort of slavish feeling in which she had een nurtured,
she hurried forwvard to obey him. Had she possessed greater moral
courage, many subsequent events would have been different.
After the first salutation was over, MIiss bBrotherton, making a strong
mental effort to subdue her agitation-of which she was infinitely more
z26
THE IRFE AD ADVEFURES
capable than her companion-begged her to sit down; and then,
placiug herself where she could have, as a commentary on what she
might induce her to say, the advantage of watching her countenance,
she pronounced in a voice that she in vain laboured to render steady,
 My dear Miss Martha, I have suffered a great deal of uneasiness
since I last saw you respecting the little boy for whom-concerning
whom-I mean hlichael Armstrong, Marthal HIis mother is very
wretched because she cannot discover to what place he has been sent;
and I, nothing doubting that it would be perfectly easy to learn this
from you, rashly promised that I would obtain this information. Can
you, dear girlI tell me more upon this subject now, than you could
when last we met'
I1 cannot, Miss Brotherton'' replied Martha Dowling, in a voice
so low and husky, as hardly to be audible, but with a complexion and
features that spoke so plainly what was passing in her heart, that Mary
felt ashamed of having placed herself where she could so distinetly
read all she suffered, and leaving her chair to share the sofa on which
the poor girl was seated, she took her hand and snid,
 My poor dear Martha1 It would be better for us both that I hould
speak sincerely. I have become acquainted with an individual,
Martha, who knows more, much more, than either you or I can do,
my dear girl, respecting the factories-those great magazines of
uman life and labour by which your father, and mine also, have grown
from poverty to wealth. This person, MIartha, n my questioning him
respecting the probable destination of a child so circumstanced, did
not scruple toe reply, that if his master were displeased, and wished to
be rid of him, thiere were places-factories, mills, dear Mlartha, where
the business was so managed as to render labsour very heavy punish-
ment, and where it was easy to keep children, ay, hundreds of tliem,
unseen and unknown for years. Do not tremble thus, dear Martha
Do not draw your hand away from mel Most sure I am that your
heart and my heart must beat in sympathy on such a subject as this,
Let us be mutually sincere, and we may help each other to undo
whatever wrong may have been done. We know, we both well know,
that your father aas displease with this poor widow's son. Wo
know, too, that he is a person of great power and influence. The boy
is gone-he will not tell us where. What is the inference? Turn not
from it, Martha Dowling, turn not from it, my poor friend, but boldly
and honestly seck out the truth, and let me know enough of it to save
this helpless child from further sufiering.''
I have no means, Miss Brotherton,'' faltered poor Martha.  II
all your dreadful thoughts were true, which you have no right to think
they are-and stiIll less havc I-but if thcy were true, all true, I have
no means to know it,''
If e have ANY reason to believe them true,'' said MIary, solemnly,
``means usr be taken, MIartha Dowling, to stop further wrong: and
this can only be by learning where Mlichael Armstrong has been sent.
I apply to you for this with great reluctance, because I know the sub-

Fect ceannot be brought hefore you without causing yott pain. But I
feel it my duty not to shrink from this, and it is yours, my dear girl,
to obtain the information I require.''
But if I agreed with yo in this, Nliss Brotherton, what are my
means of obtaining it beyond your own3?'' said Martha, rousing her-
self, aud feeling renewed courage from remembering that there was no
proof whatever of the boy's being otherwise than well and happy.
e Nay, Martha,'' returned the heiress gravely, `` amongst those en-
gagcd in your father's service, you can hardly be at a loss to find some
one who must have been employed in removing him,''
And would you have me,'' replied the poor girl, indignantly,
 would you have me tamper with my father's servants, in order to ab-
tain a knowledge of what it may be his will to keep secret2 Miss
Brotherton, I would rather die than do so.''
1 honour your filial feelings, Martha, and grieve to think that you
are placed in circumstances which must compel you to make them se-
condary,'' said Mary, gently.
Nathing can make them secondary,'' retorted Martha, warmly,
I love my father, and I hold my duty to him the first and the
highest 1 have to perform on earth.''
:Save only what you owe to your own soul, Martha Dowling,'' re-
plied Mary. : IHad you been yourself for nothing in this matter, I
might think as you do, that your duty as a child must prevent your in-
terfering in it, though even that, I suspect, would be but doubtful
morality. But, MIarthal the case is othcrwise. It was by yonr influ-
ence that this helpless widow was induced to send her child away. She
did not trust your father, but she trusted you. Do you not know,
Martha, that lI speak the truth? And if I do, can you for an instant
doubt that your first duty is to redecm the pledge yo gave to this
poor trusting creature, who hazarded all that was dearest to her in
life, upon your assurance?''
A passionate burst of tears, that seemed rather to convulse than re-
lieve the bosom on which they fell, was the only answer Mlary received
to hcr cogent reasonings, and so evident was the suffering of the in-
nocent culprit who appeared writhing under the discipline she inflicted,
that nothing less deeply impressed on her heart than was the remem-
brance of Edward and his mother, and the grief that threatened to
destroy them both, couldl have given her courage to persevere.
Marthal dear Marthat Be reasonable:'' cried Mary, throwing
her arms round her.` If you knew what I suffere in aking you
sufler, you would pity me1 But I have no choice left me. I am not
a free agent, MIartha, nny more than you are; we are both bound in
honour, honesty, Christian faith, and Christian mercy, not to let any
feeling stop us till we have restored Michael Armstrong to his mo-
ther.'
 Restore him 1'' sobbed Martha.  Alas 1 Miss Brotherton, the poor
woman herself has prevented the possibility of that1 Do you not
know that he is apprenticed 2''

therton, as to return unattended and on foot. ee Perfect love casteth
out fear,'' amd perfect icar may perhaps petrify the heart into a sort
of unstruggling desperation: but a union of the two reduces the mind
to a state of slavery the most abject, leaving no strength whereby
any healthful moral feeling can be sustained. Martha's whole care,
on returning home, was to satisfy her father that nothing particular
had passed in her interview with the heiress; and, unfortunately for
all parties, she succeeded.
Miss brotherton, meanwhile, mounted a little pony phaeton with
Mrs, Tremlett, and with a heavy heart proceeded to Hoxley-lane.
But, painful as was her errand, her condition was a far happier one
than that of Martha Dowling; for in her there was no mixture of
motives to paralyze every word andact. Her kind heart sought and
found counsel in her sound and upright judgment, and, sustained by it,
she exeeuted her task without shrinking. A little reflection on the
subject convincel her that it was now become her duty to confess to
her poor client, not only that her exertions to discover the abode of
Michael had been unsuccessful, but that she began to fear that there
must be some utpleasant reason for the ditficulties thrown in the way
of ohtaining the information she had sought. It required some cou-
rage to utter this'; but when it wasdone, Mlary was surprised to pereeive
that its effect, both upon the mother and son was very trifling. Having
candidly stated her fears, she remained silent, the eyes of both being
fixed upon her with a sort of quiet hopelessness that was perhaps
more paiuful to contemplate than more vehement demonstrations of
grief.
e Our thanks are not the less due to you, ma'am,'' said the widow
gently, `` and don't vex your kind heart by thinking that we are dis-
appointed. Edward and I guessed true from almost the first; that is,
from when he was taken off without bidling us good-bye. Sir Mat-
thew is known better by his nill people, ma'am, than by the great
gentry that turns their eyes away from labour and sorrow,to revel and
grow fat upon our graves. You would never be like to hcar the truthi
from them, and l am told that even now, the country round rings with
praises of Sir Matthew's gooiness to Mlichael. 'ITe bitter to hear it.
bBut it is God's will our portion should be bitter here. He has power
to make it up to us hereafter, and it is there we must fix our hope.''
 MIost sure and most blessed is that hope''' replied Mnry, fervently,
``yet it should never check our efforts to put to profit the means of
happiness he has granted to us here. I have now told you the very
worst, MIrs. Armstrong, for I have told you not only all I know but
nll I fear-nor will I again pledge myself to do more than I am quite
sure it is in my power to perform. I think you will believe, without my
talking about it, that I shuall not give up the search I have undertaken.
But till some nelight reaches us, we should but waste our time, and
wear our spirits by speaking on the subject. Let us rather think and
speak of the welfare of the denr boy that is lelt you; this will be nc
hindrance to our restoring his brother, if it be God's will that we
230

should have the power. Tell me, Edward, how did you get on at
school to-day?''
 Every body was kind to me,'' answered the boy.
e That's well, dear boy, and every body will be kind to you. Ie
looks nicely in his new clothes, does he not, rs Armstrong?''
He does indeed, ma'am l and I could almest fancy that he
lookel better in health already, for having left the mill,'' replied the
widow,
`And I feel better,'' said Edward, looking at his mother with his
soft thoughtful eyes, ``and I don't think that it would be impossible
for me to grow well again.''
 My boy y boy1' cried the paor cripple, raising herself in her
bed, and throwing her arms around himn.  Shoull I dare to complain
of any thing if that were possible. But oh  Teddy 1 wouldn't he
have given one of his little hands to see it?''
This appeal, which in truth only echoed the thoughts of his own
heart, overthrew all the conrage of Edward, and his tears again flowed
as fast as those of his poor mother; a renewal of eakness of which
they might both have been still more ashamed than they were, had
they not perceied that neither MIiss bBrotherton nor her old friend had
dry eyes.
Mary, however, was too wise to let this last.
 This dear boy,'' said she, `' has said that which ought to give us
all courage. I can hardly tell you the delightfal feeling which the
hope of his restoration to health would gie me. It would repay me
a thousand fold for all the pain I have suffered. Let us fix our
thoughts on this hope, and trust me it shall be realized, if medical
skill and kind treatment can do it.'
It was with this assurance she left them, and if any earthly promise
could have healed the anguish of the mother's heart, it would have
been this. But her two children were so twinel and twisted together
in her thoughts, that meditating upon her hopes for Elward inevitably
brought her terrors for Michael before her, and it was but with a
fitful sort of satisfaction that the boy dwelt upon his anticipations of
being useful to her, or that she listened to him.
Two daeys after this, while Miss Brotherton and MIrs. Tremlett were
pursuing their usual morning occupations in the boudoir, a servant an-
nounced that a lay and gentleman were in the drawing-room.
Hlad the announcement been of a gentleman alone, Mlary's thoughts
ould have instantly suggested Mr. Bell, for they had been fixed upon
him, and the hope of his coming, hrough both the precediog days.
But the mention of the lady puzzled her. Nevertheless the gentleman
was MIr. Bell, and no other, and the frank and simple kindness with
which he said, as he led the lady forward to meet her, ` Iiss
Brotherton l I wantedl my wife to know you too,'' rendered the in-
troduction as agreeable as it was unexpected.
`'Ift you and I, my dear young lady,'' said he, ``take to consulting
together concerning what we may hope, and what we may do in aid of
the suffering people by whom we are surrounded, we shall do well to

siasm,-` methinks I could carry through an enterprise which had the
recovery of little Michael for its object, with a degree of diplomatic
skill thiat would surprise you. Il should not be by downright and
direct inquiry that I should proceet. Where such inquiry would be
likely to excite suspicion, 1 would only contrive to insinuate myself
and my eyes, and would ask no questions sae what they should
answer,''
Many strangers, travelling, desire to see the factories, certainly,''
replied Mr, Bell, musingly.  But you are so young to undertake a
wandering expedition. And then, how could you be accompanied l
Your servants would unquestionably announce you every where,''
:I am older, lI think, than you suppose,'' replied Mary;: ``and il
I undertake this, I will be aecompanied by MIrs. Tremlett, with whom I
have no reserves, and by no one else.''
 You cannot travel without attendants, MIiss Brotherton ?'' said
the clergyman, looking at her kindly, but as if doubting that she was
quite in earnest.
Do not either of you judge me harshly,'' repliel the heiress,
with great earnestness; ` do not set me down in your jdgments as
a hot-headed girl, indifferent to the opinions of society, and anxious
only to follow the whim of the moment. Did I belong to any one, I
think I should willingly yiell to their guidance. But I am alone in
the world; I have no responsibilities but to God and my own consci-
ence, and the only way I know of, by which I can make this desolate
sort of freeiom endurable, is by fearlessly, and without respeet to any
prejudices or opinions whatever, employing my preposterous wealth in
assisting the miserable race from whose labours it has been extracted.
If you can aid me in doing this, you will do me good; but you will
do me none, Mr. Bell, by pointiug out to me the etiquettes by which
the movements of other young ladies are regulatel. l cannot think
that I have any right to a place among them; and I therefore feel that
to check any possible usefulness by a constant reference to the usages
of persons with whom I have little or nothing in common, would bc
putting on very heavy harness, neither effective for use, nor for orna-
ment. But ` something too much of this.' I must not talk of my-
self,'' shce udded, cheerfully. `` ILet us examine the possibility of my
setting off with Mrs, Tremlett on a little home tour, without announcing
the important event to the neighbourhood, or taking any servants with
me to enact the part of Fame behind my chariot.''
`By what convceyance wvould you propose to travel, Mliss Brother-
ton?'' inquirel Mr. Bell, still looking, as an American would say, ` as
if he could not realize the scheme.''
MIary meditated for a momnent, and then replied-- In the first in-
stance, if you and Mlrs. Bell will permit , we shall go to your house
in the same manner a sbefore, only carrying with us a small travelling-
trunk or so, such as would be necessary if we were going to pass a
week with you. On the following morning we would set off by the
coach, in which you will secure places for us. A' e

factories.''
``And he will tell you tbat such and such factories-naming pre-
cisely those in which there would not be the slightcst chance of find-
ing the boy-may be seen by application made to Mr. So-and-so,''
said Mr. Bell,
MIary coloured, and scemed about to answer him; but, either from
consciousness that she had nothing vcry satisfactory to reply, or be-
causc she had some notion in her head not sufficiently digested to
communicate, she changed her purpose, and instead of combating an
objcction which scemed almost fatal, drew from her pocket a selt of
littlce ivory tablets, on whiel she had written the names of all the esta-
blishments within a distance of twenty miles, notorious for taking ap-
rcenticcs, and of retaining them by means that converted the scene of
their labour into a most strict and wretched prison-house. She read
their names aloud.  ThCse, I think, were all you mentioned to me21''
 she. I hink thcy wee,'' replied Mr. Bcll.  But to these,
believe e, you will get no admission as a visiter,'
 Will you admit me as a visiter, if I come to you the day after to-
morrow, MIrs. Bell'' said the heiress, playfully, and apparently wishing
to wave any further discussion of her projects.
MIost joyfully .'' was the kind and hospitable reply.
 Then, for the rest we must trust to clance. And now, if you will
let me, I will show you my pretty garden,'' said Miss Brotherton,
rising, and taking from na chair by the opcn window the ever-ready
:r:
helieve I am only truly thankful for this,'' she continued,  I hardly
know how I should pass my life if I had not a gardlen.'
The garden was indeed one that spoke of its owner's love, by a multi-
tude of cnjoyable nooks that scemcd all courting her approach, and by
that perfection of elegant neatness which is ncvcr found in an equal
degree where the mistress is indilferent respecting it. To her new
fricnds' praises of all this she listened with pleasure, and sketched many
pleasant plans for future meetings, when they should not, as they de-
clarcd unavoidable now, remain only while their horse was resting.
But Mlary said not a word more on the subject of hcr purposcd expe-
dition till the very moment of their departure, and then it was only ta
remind them that they would sce her comc with her friend to claim
their promised hospitality on the next day butone. This was received
with renewved promises of a joyful welcome, and so they parted.
The next day was a busy one for MIary. In the first place she was
closetcd for at least two hours after breakfast with Mrs. Tremlctt, nd,
whatever might be the subject of their conversation, it appcared to cnd
satisfactorily, for when it was ovcr lary embraced her old friend very
cordially, saying,  I feel more grateful, much more grateful, than I
have words to express, nurse Tremlett, and never shall lI forget  your
kindness to me '"
Aftcr this they drove to the entrance of Hoxley-lane, and walked
234
TEE ILIE IND ADETRES
thence to pay a farewell visit to Mrs., Armstrong: and here it was evi-
dent that, however wild the projects might be which the heiress had
conceived, she knew how to be discreetly silent concerning them, for
after bestowing upon the widow a gratuity sufficient to supply all her
wants for a longer time than she purposed to be absent, she took leave
of her, saying,' You will not see me again MlIrs. Armstrong for a week
or more, I am engaged to go from home for that time; but I shall take
care that Edward shall receive asmuch attention at the school as if I wcre
at home. Be sure also, that my absence will not make me the less
mindful of Michael. Neither at home or abroad shall I cease to employ
every means in my power to obtain intelligence concerning him,''
T6 Edward, whom she visited at the school, she gave the same
assurance, adding an earnest injunction that he should keep in mind
the necessity of exerting himself, both for the industrious prosecution
of his studies, and the not less important regulation of his mind on the
subject of his brother's absence, the welfare of his mother greatly de-
pending upon both. Weakness of cery kind seemed to vanish before
the powcrful stimulant thus offered, and she left her little protege
omforted and invigorated by the belief that he had a great duty to
perform, and that his mother was the object of it.
The preparations for her own and her friends' convenience during the
journey were ery simple, but they puzzled her maid considerably.
First, it was so very odd that she sbhould be going out upon a visit and
take absolutely no dinner dresses at all with her; and sccondly, it was,
if possible, odder still, that she shonldnot take her. But Mary listened
to all the hints and innuendoes to which these feelings gave rise with a
sort of gentle indifference, which was doubtless ery provoking, till at
length she was induced to damp the curiosity, which she feared might
prove inconveniently active duringher absence, by saying, `` I am going
to visit the family of a clergyman, MIorgan, and, as much dress will not
be necessary, I shall uot want you.''
This was perfectly satisfactory. ` A clergyman's family, where much
dress would not be necessary, was where the lady's maid nevcr did nor
never could want to go.''
Nothing could have been more judicious than these exsplanatory
words. They accorded perfectly with the report of the servants who
attended the carriage, and so completely satisfied the household, that,
though it was the first absence of so long duration that she had made
from her home since she became mistressof it, it fortunately led to no
gosipings whatever.
WVe must not pause to describe the pleasant sociable evening passetl
by our travellers at the house of Mr. Bell, nor even relate all that
was said in the course of it, concerning the expedition they were about
to undertake. Every instrction, every hint which Mr. Bell believed
might be useful, he gave clearly and succinctly, and not a word of it
was lost upon Mlary.

Ir was about nine oclock on a bright atumn morning that Miss
Brotherton ani her faithful nurse mounted into a lumbering six-inside
vehicle, bound forea. Their two small trunks with  Mrs. Trem-
lett, passenger,'' modestly writtcn on both, were safely lodged on the
top; MIr. Bell gave them a silent blessing and a silent nod; the horse-
boy vociferated ` all right,'' and the richest young lady in Lancashir
rolled off, very literally in search of adventures.
The novelty of her situation, and of her sensations of every kind, the
nceremonious examination bestowed upon her by a smart young clerk
who sat oppasite, the anxious look of Mrs. Tremlett's usually tranquil
face, and the consciousness that the enterprise she was upon must
even bhy herself be charaeterized as wildly extravagant, if not carried'
through with much steady courage and discretion, altogether produced
a feeling of oppression on her heart that very nearly overcame her. '` Am
I acting rightly in thus exposing myelf?'' was the question that her
startlied nerves suggested : and had her conscience been unable to
answer it boldly and promptly, her condition would have been really
pitiable. Happily, however, this was not the case. There was some
feminine timidity about Mary Drotherton, but not an atom of false
shame or affectation of any kind. ` Yes:-I am rightl'' was the
answer recordel on her heart of hearts, `` and shame to me if I ghrink
at the first step, for no better reason than because the dust flies, and
a vulgar yong man stares me in the face.''
From that moment Mlary recoiled no more:; and a little resolute
meditition on her object, and of the strength demnanded to obtain it, so
effectually restored her usual self-possession, that she looked round
upon her fellow-travellers with as little embarrassment as if she had
been used to travel in public all her life, nodded to Mlrs. Tremlett with
an encouraging smile, and thought how very silly neople were who
fancied that every thing unusual must of necessity be terrible.
`Are you going all the way tore f. miss?'' said a goodnatured-
looking woman who sat bodin between the smart clerk and Mrs.
Temlett.
Yes, ma'am, I am,'' replied Mary, civilly.
The good-natured woman twisted herself round to reconnoitre MIrs.

e No, ma'am-the lady is a fciend''
236
TIIE LIER AXD ADVENTURES
E Oh1 I ask your pardon: yo are so very much alike made me
say it.''
Mary bowed-MIrs. Tremlett smiled.
The gaodnatured-looking woman persevered in the same train of
pertinent observation, sometimes addressed to one passenger, and
soetimes to another, so as to prevent the party from sinking ioto total
silence, which might otherwvise, perhaps, have happened. But Mary
bore her share in this trifling annoyance with perfect good-humour:
and when at length they arived at e r, and MIrs. Tremlett asked her
in rather piteous accents, the moment they were alone together, whether
she did not feel drealfully worn out, she cheerfully repliel,
 Not the least in the world, my dcar friend.''
 Thank Gol I'' replied the old woman, fervently, ::I know you da
so hate to be botherel, MIary, that I was afraid that old fool would
put you out of all patience.''
 Times are altered with me now, nurse Tremlett,'' replicd Mary;
1 have left off living for myself, and 1 feel my temper improving
already by it. Now, then, ring the bell, and give your orders; remem-
ber, nurse, you are the great lady, and must order every thing,''
Encouraged by this cheerful submission to circmstances, which
was in truth somewhat more than she expected, MIrs. Troemlett begn
to think that MIary might indeed prove capable of carrying through
the scheme, the first sketch of which had appeared so wild, that uothing
short of a devotion to her will, which knew no bounds, could have
surmounted her averseness to it.
MIy darling child 1' cried the old woman, looking at her with equal
almiration and delight, ` your mind is as strong as your heart is
tender, and never will I again opose my silly ignorance to any thing
you wish to do.''
It was not difficult in this first stage of their expedition to follow
texactly the plan that had been leid down. The two ladies professed
themselves to be travellers, anxious to sce all objects of curiosity, and
particularly the faetories, which were, as they obserred, so famous
throughout all the world. The master of the hotel where they lodged
exerted himself with the utmost civility to gratify so natural a desire,
and Mrs. Tremlett ant MIary were accordingly promenaded, on the
following morning, through one of the largest establishments of the
town. It is probable, from the drowsiness of the public mind on the
subject, that many travelling strangers who are in like manner led by
a skilful official through the various floors of a factory, retire from the
spectacle they preseut without having any feeling of sympathy excited
by the cursory glance they have thrown over the silent unobtrusive
little beings, one moment of whose unchanging esistence they have
been permitel to witness. It is the vast, the bcautiful, the elaborate
machinery by which they were surrounled that called forth all their
attetion, and all thcir wonder. The uniform ceaseless movement,
sublime in its sturdy strength and unrelenting activity, drew every eye,
and rapt the obscerver's mind in boundless admiration of the marvel-
lous power of sciencel No wonder that along every line a score of

noiseless children toiled, unthought of, after the admirable machine.
Strangers do not visit factories to look at them; it is the triumphant
perfection of British mechanism whichr they come to see, it is of that
they speak, of that thcy think, of that they boast when they leave the
life-consuming process behind them. The more delicatc, and (aulas 1)
living spings by which the Gnasr ArIcER has given movement t
the beings made in his own image, are not worth a thought the while.
The scientific speculator sees nothing to cxcite his intellectual acumen
in them; he hardly knows that they are there, but gazes with enthu-
siasm and almost reverence on the myriads of whirling spindles amidst
which they breathe their groeans, unheeded, and unheard.
Dut it was not thus that Mary won her way through the whirling
hissing world of machinery into which she now entered for the first
time in her life. The hot and tainted atmosphere seemed to wcigh
upen her spirits, as well as upon her lungs, and the weary aspect of the
Drakes, and the failing joints of Edward Armstrong became fearfully
intelligible as she watched the children (and she wateched nothing else)
who dragged their attenuated limbs along. Then it was that Mr, Boll's
tremendous statement of the number of suffering beings thus employed
came with full force upon her mind. She would have given years of
existence at that moment, could she have believed it false. Two
hundred thousand little creatures, created by the abounding merey of
God, with faculties for enjoyment so perfect, that no poverty short of
actual starvation can check their joy so long as innocence and liberty
be left them1 Two hundred thousand little creatures, for whose free-
dom from toil during their tender years the awful voice of nature has
gone forth, to be snatched away, living and feeling, from the se
nir of heaen, while the beautiful process is going on by which their
delicate fabric gradually streugthens into maturity,-taken for ever from
all with which their Maker has surrounded them for the purpose of
completing his own noblest work-taken and lodged amidst stench and
stunning, terrifying tumult,-driven to and fro, till their little limbs bend
under them-hour after hour, day after day-the repose of a moment
to be purchased only by yielding their tender bodies to the fist, the
heel, or the strap of the overlooker1 All this rushed together upon
poor Mary's heart and soul, and, turning deadly pale, she seized the
arm of her friend to save herself from falling.
 Terible hot ay1'' roared their conductor, in the hileous scream
by which some human voices can battle successfully with the din of
machinery.
Fortunately, they were near the door of the room, and Mrs. Trem-
lett, urging her steps forward, now brought her to an open window
outside it. The fresh air, so carefully excluded within,r soon revived
her: the colour returned to her lips, and having remained silently in-
 Exccept in the mills of Mcssr. W'ool and Walker, at Bradford, it is difficult
to find any factory properly ventilated-free aission af air being injurious to
mnny of the rocesses cnrriel on in them.

haling the breeaze for another minute or two, she signified her wish to
proceed.
Not now, Mary1 Pray, not now 1'' said the frightened Mrs.
Tremlett.  Indeed, indeed, you have not strength for it1''
Mary gave her one steady look, and the opposition ceased: for it
said as plainly as look could speak-`Is it thus that I shall find
Michael Armstrong''
For a moment I felt the hest oppressive,'' said Miss Brotherton,
in a voice of very steady composure. ` HBut I am quite sure the sea-
sation will not return. I came to  r on purpose to see the factories,
my dear friend, and, indeed, you must not disappoint me.''
 The young lady's right,'' replied thei conductor. Shell never
see the like of our mills, you may depend upon that. Wly all the
machinery in the known world put all together won't equal one of our
spinning-mills. There is nothing in creation to compare to it: and 1
don't question but the young lady heard as much before she come.
So it would be altogether wrong to disappoint her of the sight
of em.''
 Thank you,'' said Mary.  Arce we to go up stairs now ?
 Yes, if you please, miss. We hae got seven stories here, and,
thank Gol, all is busy just now, one as the other, from the bottom to
the top,''
On entering the second room MNary felt, as she expected, that her
bodily strength was quite sufficient to sustain her. She had not
habituated herself to `` seek the sun upon the upland lawn,'' for
nothing. Few girls so lapped in luxury could boast of equal vigour
and activity. The first aspect of the system (the horrors of which had
been so clearly explained to her) in action, was for a moment over-
whelming-but it was past-the terrible `premicr pas'' could not come
again; and far from shrinking from the task she had imposed upon
herself, she left the enormous fabric, after having perseveringly mounted
to its summit, with the satisfactory conviction that she should not fil'
in her enterprise either from want of strength, or from want of will.
Good Mrs. Tremlett, however, still felt less confident upon the subjcct,
and no sooner found herself tete--tete with her young mistress within
the shelter of thcir drawing-room, than she said, `` You will never stand
, Miss Mary l-feeling about it all as you do-the sight of those poor
ragged, sickly little souls will be thc death of you.'
 Then so let me die, dear nurse:' replied MIary.  IfI have not
vigour enough both of mind and body to be in some degree useful, I
should hardly think it worth while to live; but Iknow myself beucr,
nurse Tremlett. I turned sick and giddy, I confess, on entering that
first room, but it is my fricend, MIr. lell, who has to answer for i. The
impressions receied at that moment by my senses served as a specimen
of all the horrors 'he had described to me. The account I had heard
enabled me at a glance to comprehend the scene before me, while that

cannot return pon me again in the same manner: I am already
hardened. Think therefore no more of me, dear friend, but let us
cogitate together upon the likeliest way of turning all such visits to
account.''
This cogitation led them both to the conclusion that it might, for the
sake of appearanees, be as well to take the landlord's recommendution
to another of the establishments, usually pointed out to the attention of
strangers, and then to consult the ivory tablets, and venture upon a
isit to the only one near e r named therein, as notorious fIor the
reception of apprentices.
In pursuance of this plan, the waiter wasagain interrogated when he
attended the lalies at their luncheon, and again he brought a written
address from his master, accompanied by a message intimating that the
following morniug being Bunday, the ladies might have the advantage
of visiting the Sunday-school attached to the factory, for which he had
given the address, to a sight of which they would be admitted without
difficulty, if they would make known their wishes for such admission to
the person who wonld show them the factory.
 There is a Sunday-school attached to the establishment?'' aaid
Mary in an aecent of great satisfaction. : Yes, miss,'' replied the man,
 Messrs. Robert and Joseph Tomlins, the serious gentlemen as owns
the factory, has built a school-room altogether at their own expense,
and attends their ownselves in person every Sunday morning to see
that both master and children puts the time to profit. Their factory
is about a mile or so out of the town, but master says as he can let you
have a carriage ery reasonable.''
I should wish to go there by all means,'' replied Mary, `` desire the
carriage may be got ready for us directly.''
The man left the room to obey her.
efhank Heaven l'' exclaimed Mary, as the door closed hehind him,
there is, then, some Christian feeling still left among them here, as well
as at Bradford. We shall not here, at least, be shocked by witness-
ing such degrading ignorance as that of the poor Drakes.-They are
trcated like Christian children, at any rate.''
Most surely it is a pleasure to hear of it, my dear,'' replied Mrs.
Tremlett, '` and it is quite as well, MIary, that we have got to ride toit-
at least if you feel like me, my dear.''
Less than half an hour's drive brought the travellers to a large factory,
which, whatever it might be within, wason the ountside, though in itself
as grim as coal-smoke could make it, surrounded by a fine expanse of
rural scenery. In answer to their application at the gates they were
civilly desired to walk in, and presently found that the routine of exhi-
bition was precisely similar to that of the morning. It struck them
both, however, that if possible, the children looked more worn and
weary, more miserably lean, and more frightfully pallid, than those they
had seen before ; nevertheless MlIary failed not, when taking leave of their
couductor, to request ermission to attend the Sunday-school on the

lical, as the broadest Irish brogue does the birthright of the speaker to
call himself a son of the Emerald Isle.  Cerainly the Lord forbid
that Christian women should ask to be present at the doings of the
godly and be refused l'
On inquiringthe hour at which they should be there, 'the man replied,
t As the clock in the toer of the Lord's house strikes seven, Mr,
Josenh Tomlins, by the blcssing of God, will becgin to speak the exhor-
tation. The prayer will follow from the lips of Mr. lobert, and then
the schooling will begin.''
We musit be here, then, exactly at seven ?'' said MIary.
 Ten minutes earlier, would be more decent time,'' replied the man, with'
a gravity of aspect that approached a frown, `` our gentlemen are very
strict as to their hours in all things.''
They civilly promised to be very punctual, and departed. The
factory was built on the side of a hill, so steep, that the back part of
it, to which the shed used as a schnol-room was attached, could not be
safely approached by a carriage; MIiss Brotherton, therefore, and her old
friend, on arriving at the bottom of the hill on the followving morning,
got out, and, desiring the vehicle to await their return, proceeded on
foot by the path pointed out to them as ` the way to Master Tomlin's
school,.'' The ladies were more than punctual, for it still wanted a
quarter to seven, they therefore seated themselves on a fallen tree by
the road side, and watched the arrival of one or two miserable-looking
children who wvere laggingly approaching the spot-
 Yon look half asleep my poor cehild1'' said Mary, laying hcr hand
on the shoulder of a liule girl, who ragged, pale, half-vashed, and wih
eyes half-closed, was being dragged onward by an older child, a boy,
apparently about ten years old.
She be so hard asleepby times,''said the boy,' that Ican'tget heron.''
 But why is that, my dearl surely seven o'clock is not so very
early :' said Mary.
 We were all to the mill till five ninutes afore twelve,'' said the
boy, making another eflort to pull his sister onward.
eHow 1-do you mean to tell me thatyou were working at mid-
night ?'' demanded Mlary.
:Five minutes alore twelve we stopped-'cause it was Sunday,''
replied the boy.  Come along eggy :' he added with another stout
tug, ``I shall catch it to-morrow from the laooker if 1se too late Ior the
'sortation.'
The litle gil ho ha llen firly asleep, during this short delay,
being thus roused again, stumhled onwards, leaving Mrs. Tremlett and
Mary alike undeceived as to the humanity of instituting a school to be
carried on under such regulations. They determined, however, to
witness with their own eyes the operation of teaching children to read,
who were fast asleep, and walking on camc within sight of the school-
room door just as Mr. Joseph Tomlins showed himself-on the step
before it, with his watch in one hand and a bible in the other.

]Yickel, iile, and ungrateful-'' DBut at this monient Miss Brotherton
(nd MIrs. Tremlett appeared in sight, anl in a oice sudlenly chnged
rom reprobation into drawling softness, he went on,  Come unto Him
] ttle children-I forbid you not, but urge you w ith tender Christian
 ve, early and late, late and early, to hear His word, and sing His
]raise.''
]Here he stonped, and bowing to the ladies offered to lead them to a
lace where they might be well accommodated for the exhortation and
]nd payer, and for hearing the children also, if they wished it.
] As soon as they had entered the sort of pew to whieh Mr, Tomlins
]d them, the twenty or thirty miserable-looking children who were
sembled in the room were called upon by a loud word of command
 KxEEL' and down they tumbled, the elder ones in several in-
ances taking the little creatures already asleep beside them, and
]acing them on the floor as nearly as they eould in the attitude com-
]anded. The sonorous voice of Mr, Joseh Tomlins was then heard
lonouncing an exhortation, intended to show that obedience to theit
:rthly masters was the only way of saving children from the eternal
]rning, prepared for those who were disobedient, in the world to come.
]Mary, as she looked earnestly round upon eery child present,
]eatly doubted if there was one sufficiently awake to listen to this;
d in her heart she blessed the heaviness which saved them from hearing
]e mercy of their Maker blasphemed. A prayer followedt this exhort-
]on, as little like what a prayer ought to be, as was the preparation
the little congregation who listened to it for bearing part in a
]igious ceremony. Sill Mary Brotherton waited to the end, nor left
]r station till the nominal business of instruction had proceeded
ciently to convince her that poor ophy Drake's account was
]ictly true when she said ' keepiag our eyes open undays wasn't
]ssible, 'cause they didn't strap us.'' Tha children were not strapped,
]l conseuently they were, with very few exceptions, literally fast
]eep during the hour and half that this ostentatious form of instruction
]a going on
]Inwilling to attract more notice than was necessary, Miss Bro-
rton and her companion remained till the drowsy tribe were roused,'

TRE LIFE AND ADVENTRE9
But you don't expect to get in, my dear, do you?-aftcr all Mr.
Bell told you about apprenticesl'' exclaimed MIrs., Tremlett.
 Probably not,'' was the answer, `` and in that case, my dear woman,
you know what is to happen.''
 You are really in earnest then, HMiss Marg ?'' rejoined her friend
in an accent which betrayed some nervousness.  kou really mean to
do all you said when we were shut up together2''
Most certainly I do,'' replied Miss Brotherton, gravrely.  Did you
suppose I was jesting, nurse Iremlett, in what I then said to you ?''
Not jesting, Miss Mlary.-No, certainly, not jesting. Only 1
thought that may he after a little more thinking about it you might
change your mind.''
 You do not yet understand me, nursel'' said Mary, with vexation.
e You do not yet comprehend how determined I am to persevere in the
business I have undertaken.''
:Do not say so, dearest MIiss MlIary '' replied the old woman with
emotion, ``I do nnderstand you,-I do know that you will leave no
stone unturned to obtain your object,-and indeed, indeed, I love you
a thousand times better than ever 1 did, and that is just because I
do understand you; only I did not feel quite sure that you wvould
have courage.''
 We shall see, nurse Tremlett. Courage, I believe, often depends
more upon the earnestness of the will than the strength of the nerves,''
said Mary.
Their attempt to get admittance to the apprentice factory as, as they
both expected, abortive; they were told that no persons wvere admitted
there except on business, and having nothing such to plead, they
retreated as they had advanced, somewhat fearful lest their having
takcn so much trouble for nothing, might excite the alarming observa-
tion, `` It is very odd,'' on the part of their driver or some of his gossips.
The distance was considerably greater than they had expected, and
they had little more time on their return to e s'e, than sufficed for
securing places in a cross-country coach for the morrow, which would
convey them to a small town named by MIr. Bell, within a morning's
drive of which were two establishments known to receive apprentices,
howsoeverand heresoever they could get them.
Having again booked their places in the name of Tremlett, pre-
pared their travelling luggage for a further progress, and taken a meal
that served for dinner and tea in one, they went to rest. But it was
long ere the excited mind of Mary permitted her to sleep: nor did
she, in fact, close her eyes till, after repeated consideration, she had
decided totally to change the plan of operations she had fixed upon
for the morrow.
MIrs. Tcemlett had not yet left her bel, when her young mistress
appeared at the foot of it, on the following morning, with her ivory
tablets in her hand.  Nurse Tremlett,'' she said, e do you remember
which, among all the places mentioned here, was the one Mr. Bell
declared that he considered as the most likely for Sir Matthew to
have selected, if his purpose was to keep the abode of Miehael Arm-
strong unknown 2''
oP MICIIAEL ARISTRONG.
2A3
Dear me: My lear Miss Mary1 Only think of your being up
already and me lying abed soI'' was the reply she receied.
t Never mind that, dear nurse. It is not gettng-up time yet-only
I am restless. Do you remember the name of the mills Mr, Bell par-
ticularly dwelt upon ?'
I dare say l might, Miss Mary, if I was to hear it spoken again,''
said the old woan, sitting up in bed, and endeavouring to feel
awake.
Now then listen, dear soul, and stop me when you think I name
the right.'' MIary then turned to her tablets, and read the names,
with the descriptions of the loealities inseribed there. It was not till
she had reached the lest in the list that Mrs. Tremlett again spoke,
anl then she exclaimed promptly,  That is it, Maryl I am quite sure
that is the place1 1 ll bet ten to one,' he said, ` that if Sir Mat-
thew has been for putting the boy out of sight, Deep Valley Mill is
where he will have lodged him.' Those were his words, Mfiss Mary-
I could quite swear it,'
1I was pretty sure of it before, nurse Tremlett, but now no doubt
enan possibly remain. Hear me, then, my dear kind friend, andt tell
me truly if I am right or wrong. I settled last night, nurse, to set off
and visit all these factories exactly in the order in which they are here
set down. But, after l went to bed, it struck me that it would be
surely better to begin with the place pointed out by our good frienl as
the most likely to afford success. I like the business quite as little as
you do, nurse, and would gladly shorten it, if possible.''
 But, my dear, won't the stage we are going in take us the wrong
way ?''
A little round about-but I see no objection in that; we have no
particular wish, yon know, to hae our course traced, and this setting
off in one direction, when our purpose is to take another, must go far
towards preventing it. So that you see we have no immediate change
to make, and you have only to get up, and eat your breakfast in time
to be ready for the coach, that is to sop for us here.''
 Gol bless your dear heart l' said the old woman. e You think
ten times more of me than you do of yourself, darling1 Little slecp
Iast night, Mlary, and getting up before any ody else in the morning,
is not the way to be quite strong and composed by-and-by.''
Fear nothing-I feel perfectly well, and greatly pleased by our
changc of plans. I have gret faith in this visit to Deep Valley, and
long to have the experiment made and over.''
MIary Brotherton was quite correct in her geography; the place to
which tbe conch conveyed them was at about the same distance from
Deep Valley as from r; and, without making any tfurther inquiries
concetning that mysterious spot, which indeed the memoranda reeeived
from Mr. Bell rendered quite unnecessary, she ordered a chaise, on
quitting the stage-coach, to convey them to the nearest town at which
he had stated that it would be likely they should find decent aecommo-
dation for the night.
Doth the young and the oll lady were rather surprised, on reaching
 2

this place, to find ever house in it that offered public accommodation
so poor and miserable looking, as to make them almost afraid to enter.
Their driver, however, soon drew up to one which, upon IMrs. Trem-
lett's inquiring if it were the best, he assured them, was not only the
best, but the only one that ladies could find comfortable. Here
then we will get 'out,'' sasid MIary, courageously, and giving her friend
an encouraging smile, she preceded her into a room that smelt strongly
of tobacco-smoke, ale, and gin
`Can we have an up-stairs room that might be more open and airy
like 7'' said MIrs. Tremlett, looking anxiously at her young mistress.
To sleep in?'' demanded the woman who had received them.
` sitting-room. good woman, I mean,'' responded the meek-
spirited Mrs. Tremlett, half frightened by the woman's look and accent.
 WVhat, thnis is not good enough, I suppose? Then you may trudge
-it is good enough for your betters,'' replied the woman, looking
most alarmingly sulky. Had the last been addressed to herself, Mary
lBrotherton would have thought it one of the duties imposed by her
pilgrimage to endure it; but, as it was, she slipped out of the dun-
geon-parlour with great celerity, and reached the house-door before
the postboy had succeeded in his attempts to untie the cord which
fastened their trunks behind the chaise. Apparently hands were scarce
at this unpromising hostelry, for he was performing the business alone,
at which MIary greatly rejoiced, as it enabled her to address him un-
observed.  This does not seem a comfortable hose, my lad, that
you have brought us to. Don't you think we might do better if we
tried another ?''
`It be the best in the town,'' was the reply.
Then could you not drie us a mile or two outof it?'' sai MIary,
in a very coaxing vsoice.  WVe should like to sleep at any little
country inn by the roadside a great deal better than tlis.''
 And how would my master's horses like it Iwonder ?'' said the pest-
boy. By this time Mary's purse was isible in her hand. The youth's
countenance softened as he gazed upon it, and he presently gae an
equivocal symptom of relenting, by scratching his head. Miss IBro-
therton held half-a-sovereign between her finger and thumb-`` I will
give youthis, she said, beyond the sum you are toreceive for the horses,if
you will drive us on to some clean country inn at which we could sleep''
WVhere is the old lady ''' demanded the boy in something like a
whisper.
I will bring her out tbis moment,'' said she; and, without waiting
further parley, Mary flitted back again through the vapour of tdbacco
and spirits to rescue her old friend,-a deed of daring that found its
reward in the look of gentle satisfaction with which her signal to quit
the parlour was obeyed; for MIrs. Tremlett was one who could not
bandy words, and she had therefore endured, without intermission or
resistance, as much insolence as could be compressed into the period of
her abode in the apartment.
 Yh did you not follow me at once, dear nurse?'' said Mary, as
soon as the postboy had closed the carriage-door upon them.

 Bless you, my dear, I never thought of getting away again till to-
morrow morning, and I staid with her to prevent her following yo.-
How very glad I am we are got away safe and sound from that terrible
woman: How could you have the courage and cleverness to think of
it, hlary ? Sure enough, dear, it is you that take care of me-and
that's a shame, isn't it?'
:It is but fair, nurse, that e should diide the labours of the road
hetween us. It is you who always take care that we are not starved,
and it is not too much in return that I should be watchful for your
preservation from all the wild cats and tigresses we may chance to
encounter.''
The postboy earned his golden gratuity, greatly to the contentment
of its donor, by drawing up at a small but perfectly neat little nan-
sion, where milk-pans set on end to dry before the door offered a de-
lightfulcontrast toallthathad been visible atthe sign ofthe Three Crowns..
The lean-coifed landlady looked a little surprised at being asked for
sleeping-rooms by ladies entitled to so splendid a mode of travelling,
but th demand being satisfactorily answercd, they were quickly in-
stalled in a parlour smelling of geraniums instead of gin, and giving
orders for thcir evening meal to the bustling good woman of the house
with an air of old acquaintanceship, that looked as if they had been
her guests for a month.
 Nothing was ever so fortunate as this, nurse Tremlett,'' said Mary,
as soon as they were leftalone ;`` our stage-playing, as you are pleased
to call it, must begin here. There is uo danger that this kind simple-
hearted creature should misdoubt a word we say, and if you will only
perform your allotted part with your usual quiet good sense, Ihave no
doubt but we shall reach her heart sufficiently to make her very useful.
I do not ask you to say any thing-only look sufficiently interested to
support the character l assign you.''
Oh denr Mliss Maryl'' exclaimed Mrs. Tremlett, colouring,-`is
it to egin alreay ?'
The countenance of MIiss Brotherton fell from an expression of great
animation into thut of deep despondeney and disappointment, she
found that all her dificulties with the old woman were about to be re-
newed.  OhI why, Mrs. Tremlett, if you are unequal to this, did you not
honestly tell me so when l explained my purposeto you before we setont ?''
snid she, with nore of severity than she had ever used in addressing
her during her whole life before, '`I could then have taken measures
o carry on this business without you. You know how deeply my heart
is in it-I did not expect this weakness-lI thought it was over 2''
 You are wrong, Miss Mary-you are mistaken altogether,'' re-
plied Mlrs. Tremlett, eagerly.  I1 am neither weak nor silly, and so you
shall sce, if you wont be so very rash and hasty with me.''
DBy no means displeased at the energy with which the gool woman
delenled hersclf, Mary replied, `' Let me see this, Tremlett, and my
love and value for you will increase a hundtrcd fold.''
IBegia, then, as soon as you like, my dear, I am quite ready.''

And, in saying his, the good old woman assumed an aspect as full of
confidence and courage as her own.
In a few minutes their repast, which a good dairy made luxurious,
was before them, the landlady remaining in attendance to replenish the
tea-pnot, and so forth.
MIiss Brotherton's manners, thongh by no means remarkable to those
in her own station for that perfect polsh which guards every thing
without, and every thing within, from disagreeable impressions, were
always conciliatory and kind to all belaow her, anl seldom was she
waited upon by any one who would not have gladly retained that office
near her. So it was with Mrs. Prescot of the King's Head; the good
woman lingeredl in the room, evidently beeause she liked being there,
and taking advantage of this, Mary addressed her, venturing to give
her the name she had read npon the sign.
 WVe are in Derbyshire, are we not, MIrs. Preseot ?''
e Yces, miss; this is Derbyshire, sure enough.''
 Vhat distance is it from hence to Deep Valley ?'
 WVhat, the factory, miss, that is called Deep Valley MIill g
e Yes; how far is it to that factory ?''
e Why it is not over easy to say rightly, seeing that there is no direct
road to it, It is  lonesome out-of-the-way plaee as ever humnn
beings thought of taking to, and I can't say as much is knowed about
it by any of the neighbours round. There is a cart-road, I believe, as
goes right down to the mill, but the nearest way would he over them
hills there, of course, because the factory is built down amongst the
very middlemost of 'em,'' replied Mrs. Prescot.
 WVoull the walk over thie hills be too far for my, aunt and me2''
inquiced Mlary.
Oh dear yes, miss1 I should think so1 Bosides, 'tis no place
whatcver for lalies to goto. The poor little creturs as bidcs there
bean't no sight for them to look at; and, besides, nobody of any sort
is ever let to look at 'em.''
We must get there, somehow or other, Mrs. Prescot,'' said Mlary;
: and I trust in God that we shall not be refused adnittance, for our
business is no common one''.
 You have got business at Deep Valley MI1? demanded MIrs.
Prescot, abruptly.
Indeed we have,'' replied MIary, `` and, by some means or other,
we must get in, and, what is more, we must see every apprentice
they have.''
he woman shook her head.
Ihave had more tin one lodging here for a night,'' said she,
: ho for some reason or other was curious to get inside of
Deep Valley Mill. But I never knowed one of 'em that ever lid
more than get a look down upon it from the top of one of them
mountainous hills out yonder: and it's no easy matter, they
say, to get to the right place evcn for that; for, by what folks say,

wicked one himself to find 'em out. But there's one eyc as sees
em, if no other do,''
These last words were added in a mutter that might, or might not,
be noticed, aecording to the pleasure of the parties within hearing.
Mary did not notice them.
 Could you have the kindness to tell us to  whom  we should apply
for permission to go through the factory ?'' said she.
`Indeed, miss, I am happy to sayI knows nothing about 'em, and
if all's true as Ive heard said over the ale-pot by the kitchen fire, the
more people ask for leave, the less they are likely to get it. Bnt may
I make so bold, miss, as to ask the reason why such ladies as you wants
to get in there? It would only break your hearts: and what's more,
they've been having a horrid fever there, and thnt I know for certain,
though they sent the poor little creturs otf by night to be bhuried, some
to one churchyard, and some to another, to stop people's tongues. It
bean't no place, ladies, for you to go.''
 WVhen I tell you wly we wish to enter therce you willnot say so,''
replied MIary. The mill is worked by apprentice children, is it not2'
 Yes, miss, the more's the pity--for that's what makes the poor
wretches slaves for life-for not many of 'em, by all accounts, lives till
their time is up.''
t' Henar me then, Mrs. Prescot-among those miserable apprentices we
hope and expect to find n dear child who belongs to us.''
``Lack-a-day l what a story-book that would mnke l'' exclaimed MIrs.
Prescot.  How long is it since you lost him ?''
It is a long time,'' replied Mary, evading the question, ` and it is
a long story to tell how it happened. He is my own hrother-and
this lady who is come with me is our aunt.''
 Are you quite sure, miss, that you shall find him there?''
:How can I say that, Mrs. Prescot, when you tell me so many of
the children are dead ?'' replied Mary. : Bnt so much do I think I
shall, that I will give five sovereigns to any one who will only put me
in the way to get admittance to the mill.''
MIrs. Prescot again shook her head.  There be a many and a many
poor souls round about that would do amost any thing honest for such
a reward; but if any body told you they could do as much, they would
only deceise you, I don't believe there is any body in the parish, not
even the parson, could make 'em open their loors to let strangers in.''
Do you thiuk that the person who has the pewer to open them
would do it for a hundred pounds?'' demanded MIiss Brotherton.
`I can't take upon me to say, miss; it sounds like a fortune to me
--but they are all rich at Deep Valley, as folks say, managers, over-
lookers, and all-so, may be they mayn't thiuk so much of it.''
t Mlrs. Prescot, I would givse five hundred pounds, rather than not
look over the children at Deep Valley MiIl.''
The woman stared at her with a very natural mixture of curiosity
anl astonishment; but there was a friendly interest in her eye, also. ``It's
late to-night, ma'am, to do anything,'' said she, `` and if you'll bepleased
to say nothing to nobody till my husband comes home, I don't know
2A8
rIE LIE AD ADYETRES
but what he may be as likely to think upon what would be the best
way to sct about it as any body; not that he ever meddles or makes
with the peaple of the mill in any way, but he's a god schollard, an 
guck-witted man too, as ever I knowed, tlough I say it as shouldn't.''
This proposal was reaily agreed to, and the interval till their host's
retur employed in a ramble of a mile or two along the road, where a
recent shower had laid the dust, while every woodbine in the heges
which skirted it, sent forth a delicious perfume. The outline of the
hills around the, though hardly deserving MIrs. Prcscot's epithet of
ountainous, was bold and picturesque, and the foreground, with its
hanging leels and rich copscs, altogether formed a scene of consider-
able beanty-
 AII this is very pretty, my good Tremlett,'' said Mary, offering he
arm to her old friend to assist her ascent of a steep hill, `` and I should
enjoy it greatly did I not fancy that could we look over yonder hill-
tops we should see a hateful roof, excluding the sweet breath of evening
from the helpless creatures it encloses.''
g ttet ye es teh ee or tem roo it, ny dear
child,'' replied the old woman; ` let that thought comfort you.'
 Should I succeed :' cried Mary,`` should I indeel carry home that
little fellow to his poor mother and my pretty Edward, I should
certainly feel something approaching to perfect happinessl But if 1
fail . how shall I bcar to meet them ?
 Think not of it, dearl see how that last bit of sunshine comes full
pon your face as you talk about it; that is a sign my dear that yo
will have your wish.''
It was the last bit of sunshine, for the next moment the golden disk
was hid behind a ridge of hills; yet they walked on for nearly a mile
further, and, when they returned to the King's Head, they found the
good man of the house already returned, and his suppet, as his wife
assured them, very nearly finished. ` He shall come to you in halfa
minutc, ladies, if ou'll please to be seate, while I bring in the
candles;-I hae told him all you said to me, anl he don't seem so
much put out about it, by much, as me,-but he's uncommon 'cute, as
you'll find when you comes to talk to him.''
In about a quarter of an honr Mr. Prescot knocked at the parlour-
loor, and being properly introduced to the lalies by his wife, was left
standing before them, while she retreated to pursue her various avo-
cations.
 Your wife has told you, Mr, Prescot, our reason for coming here ?''
said Miss Brotherton, glad to escape the repetition of her fictitious
tale.
 She has, ma'am,'' wvas the succinct reply.
:And do you think it possible for us to obtain admission to Deep
Valley M1ill, and to go over it in such a manner as to givse us an oppor-
tunity of seeing all the children ?'
If I had heard that much, as to your purpose, ladies, and nothing
more, I should have said o, you could nomore get into Deep Vualley
factory than into the moon. But my missis added something to the

back of it, as makes n diffcrence.'' Ths was said with a look and
accent which fully justified MIrs, Prescots assurances of her good man's
 cuteness.''
I hink, Mr. Prescot, that she suid no more than I am willing to
make good,'' replied Mlary. ''I do not wish to expend money wantonly,
but, if less will not serve, I am ready to give five hundred pounds to
; P-9n who could enable me uo sce all tho childrcn in Deep Valley
Mu
 I is a long sum,miss,'' repliel the man thoughtfully, ` and I can't
but faney that less might serve. Tho people as is in authority there
is bad people, I don't scruple to say it, and sooner than open their
doors for pity towarls any Christian soul, man, woman, or child, they
ould see 'em all in tho bottomless pit. But 'tis just because they do
all the wickedness we hears of, that I sees hope they may be bought to
break their own laws; for if they does one thing for the love of gold,
they may do another. Tis plain onough to see, to be sure, tat thoy
knows it is for their interest to keep all eyes off their cruel goings-
on-and what's for their interest they won't easily give up.-So it may
e that squire Elgood Sharpton himself would turn away from five
hundred pounds, rather than show off his poor miserable apprenitices.-
Bu that mayn't hold good for his agent, and I believe in my heart that,
if we could quietly get to ofer Woodcomb the manager a hundred
pounds, you would not have long to wait for a sight of the children,''
``And low is this to be done, Mr. Prescot?'' said Miss Brotherton,
if you can undertake to manage it, yu may put what price you like
 your services, I feel certain that you would not nme a higher sum
than I should be willing to pay.''
 Why, as for me, miss, lI must not be known to meddle or make in
the matter. Squire Sharpton would have my licence, away before I
could say Jack Robinson. Any advice I can give is at your scrvice,
and I may be able to put yo up, perhaps, to doing the thing in the
likeliest way; but as to my going to the mill, it won'1 do. One reason
is, that 1 never was there before, and it's like enough that, seeing a
stranger, they'd set the dogsat me before I had time to say my errand.
No 1-that won't answor. The only man I can think of as would give
us a chance is one Smith, the miller as soerves 'em with oatmeal, and
pretty stuff 'tis, as ve been told, which don't speak over-well for his
honesty, youll say, though, 'tis likely thc price is in proportion.
HIowsomever, whether he be good otr bad, I don't know another as
comes and goes to Deep Valley as he does, and that's what makes
me fix upon him as a messenger,''
``And when could I see this man ?'' demanded Mary.
 WVhy, betimes to-morrow, miss, there's no doubt, if I goes and
gives him notice,''
Then, do so Mr. Prescot, and be assured your trouble shall not
be forgotten.'
There is no fear of it, miss,'' replied the acute lanllord with very
honest sincerity, ``and 1ll go to the mill outright. But I think-
you'll be pleased to excuse me for speakig my mind-that you two
260
TIE LIPE AND ADVETUnES
ladies must settle between yourselves what youn'd be willing to give
imothy Smith himself for the iob-seeing that he's not one to work for
nothing;:-and another thing I'd make so free as to mention is, that
you'd do well to make him understand that you don't want to get in-
side their wicked den, but only to see the children, one and all of 'em
--and then you know, miss, they may trim 'em and scour 'em upa
little for shamie's sake, afore they briags em out''
Miss Brotherton, aftcr this conversation, felt as fully convinced as
the good wife herself could desire of the value of the landlord's head,
and determined to be guided by his advice. After a little further con-
versation between them, it was settled that she should write a note to
Mr. Woodcomb, the manager, in readiness to gise into the hands of
Mr. Timothy Smith on the following morning, if she could prevail upon
him to deliver it
Mr, Prescot performed his part of the business ably, Ior the portly
miller was waiting for the ladies in the parlour when they returned from
their early walk.
Miss Brotherton possessed a sort of instinctive skill in reading the
human countenance, which rarcly deccived her, and it took her not
long to discover that the man she had now to deal with was one upon
whom it would be folly to waste any arguments which did not affect his
own interest. She, therefore, briefly stated the fact that it was of great
importance to her to obtain sight of all thc apprentices at Deep Valley
Mill, having great reason to hope that she should find a young relative
there, for whosc release from all engagements she was willing to aY
handsomely,
 It is not the custom, ma'am, to admit visiters at that factory. It
have becen found to hinder thce work,'' replied the miller solemnly.
So I understand, sir. But, hearing that you are in the habit of
visiting the mill on business,.I have taken the liberty to send for you
in order to say, that if you would undertake to deliver this note to
Mr. Woodcomb, the manager, I would willingly give you five pounds
for your trouble.''
 That is hardly enough, ma'am, for the risk of offending sogooda
customer,'' replied the miller.
 WIl ouible that sum induce you to do it for me?'' sail MIary.
 On what day do you wish it to reach Mr. Woodcomb's hands ?'
demanded Mr. Timothy Smith, cndeavouring to retain a doubtful
expression of countcnance.
``Io-day, sir: as early as posible.''
'i,hi, i i nnioen wih s, na4 rt eo ao t
mince the matter, or deccive you in any way. lf you will pay me down
twenty pounds in gold, or Bank of England notes, I will consent to
give up all the important business I had fixcl to do this morning, and
nndertake, not only to give your letter to MIr. Woodcomb, but to use
my influcnce with him--which is grcater than you may guess for-to
make him do what yon wish, provided that you treat him with the
liherlity which a gentleman like him has a right to expect.''
Miss Brotherton drewforth her pocket-book.
o MIICnAEL AhRMIsTRONG.
2s1
I will givse you the twenty pounds you demand, Mr. Smith,'' she
said in a tone as business-like and decidel as his own, `` if you perform
my errand successfully. I will give you this ten-pound note now, as pay-
ment for conveying theletter, and another of the same value when you
return to me with the managers permission to see the children who are
apprenticed at the mill.''
Mr. Timothy Smith Iooked at MIiss Brotherton's pocket-book and he
looked a her. Ilis glance at the first inspiet a stong inclination to
increase his demands; but the miller had studied the human counte-
nance as well as the lady, and when he looked at her he felt certain
that though young, rich, and very eager in pursuit of her object, she
was not a fool, and that if he pushed her to a more preposterous pay-
ment than he had already proposed, she would be likely enough to
turn about and look for another agent. He therefore demurely replied,
tIt is all fair, maam; I agree to the terms.''
And without wasting any further time, the man of the mill received
the note, put on his hat, and departed.
Not all Mary's self-command, and, considering all things, she hal
a great deal, could cnable her to await the return of her costly messen-
gcr with composure. All that she leard of this mysterious mill tended
to prove that it was precisely such a place as Sir Miatthew Dowling
would be likely to fix upon as the abode of Michael. The more she
meditatel the more she became convinced that the boy was there, and
she was hot and cold, pale and red, a dozen times in an hour.
She had kept a copy of her letter to the manager, that she might
show it to MIr. IBell, from whom she hoped to receive absolution for the
innocent fraud she had practised. To readand re-read this letter, and
to speculate with MIrs. Tremlett upon its probable and possible effects,
occupied some portion of the tedious time; slowly dragging her steps
up and down Mrs. Prcscot's little garlen, and ocecasionally sitting for
a fidgety five minutes in a bower of scarlet-runners, employed the
rest. But the morning seemed endless, and more than once she sus-
pected that her watch stool still.
The important letter to Mr. Wooilcomb was as follows:
' Sir,-A wealthy and respectable family have recently had reason to
believe that a dear child, long eonsidered as lost, has been sent as an
apprentice to Mlr. Elgood Sharpton's factory at Deep Valley. Fully
aware that the examination necessary to prove whether this hope be
well founded, must be attended with considerable trouble to you-
inasmuch as the children must be brought out from their work for me
to see, l beg to say that, if, without giving me further trouble, you will
permit tkis, I will pay the sum of one hundred pounds for the accom-
modation. Should it be refused, l must have recourse to other means
for the purpose of ascertaining what it is so important for me to know.
I am, Sir,
 Your obedient servant,
 DonCAs TnEr,''
It was not till five o'clock in the afternoon, by which time Mary
was fully persuadel that her commission had failed, that MIr. Timothy
262

Smith, in his white hat and well-powdered blue coat, was again seen
approaching the HKing's Head. The heiress, who was sitting near the
window, started up, and would certainly have stepped forward to
meei him, had not Mfrs. Tremlett whispered,  Sit down, Miss Mary,
sit down, there's a darling, and look like a great lady as you dil
this morning: and that's what you are, and always should he.'
Mary reseated herseif, and, after a short interval, the miller
knocked at the parlour-door, and was desired to enter. Miss Drotherton
pointed to a chair. and he rested himselt. e The weather is warm,
ladies,'' said he, rawing forth a cotton handkerchioef, and wiping
his head and face, `` and I have not loitered in my errand, as yo
may see by the state I'm in; but my horse is getting in years, like
his master, and it's no easy work to drive him by such a road as
that I have comed by.''
Have you succeeded, sir?'' said Miss Brotherton, looking as
grand as Mrs. Tremlett could desire.
I am happy te ssy, ma'am,'' he replied, with dignity, ``tliat the
second ten pounds is fairly wvon.''
I rejoice to hear it,'' cried Mary, brightly coleuring; ``and I shall
have great pleasure in paying it. When, sir, may- I see these chil-
dren 7'' she added, plling ut her poeket-book as she spoke
' Here, ma'am, is Mr. WYoodcomb's reply to yaurnote, and on the
reading of that, I look to hear you say that the ten pounds is mine.'
Miss Brotlerton took the dirty epistle offered her, and real:-
eMIadam,-MIy employer is strict in his orders not to let the hands
be interrupted, as they too often are in some mills, to gratify the idle
curiosity of strangers. But in consideration of your handsome pro-
pesal, and hoping that you won't scruple to follow it with a like sum in
case of your finding and carrying away the child, which will be no
more than just, seeing that if l part with a hand I must get another in
the place of it, on this condition I am willing that all the clildren on
the premises shall be placed in the feeding-room for your inspection at
twelve o'clock to-morrow.
I am, Madam,
 Your humble servant,
eJAIEs WoonconB.''
The miller kept his eye fixed upon her as she read, and the result he
looked for followed the perusal of the despatch he had brought. Miss
Brotherton handed the letter to her friend, and then drew the promised
bank-note from her pocket-book. The jolly miller rose, and received
it from her hands. I thank you, madam,'' said he, folding it care-
fully, `` and I eg to say, in return, that you would have been troubled
to find another man who could have done your errnd as well,'
I am quite satisfied, sir,'' she replied, ``and will only ask in
aldition to what you have alreatdy done for me, that you would be
obliging enough to tell me by what conveyanee it will be best for us to
get to the factory to-morrow? MIr. WVoodcomb, as you probably know,
has named twelve o'clock. I suppose the distance is too great for us
to walk 2'

`CQuite impossible, ma'am-altogether out of the question. But I
shall have no objection to hire out my chay-cart for the dy, if so be
you would think that suitable,'' said the obliging miller.
1 have no doubt it would do perfectly well, provided you have a
horse that can draw it-I should be sorry to lose time in going, and
should not choose to be later than the hour appointed,'' replied Mary.
 I1l Iook to having a fitting horse, ma'am, and one as is used to the
road, and that is what but few are. The road is no very good one in
parts, that's the truth, and I'm not over sure that there's another man
besides myself that would like to undertake the job: but 1've no
objection to driving you myself, ladies, provided you think it worth
while to pay a tradesman for the loss of his time-of course I can't
charge my labour like a postboy.''
If you take means, sir, to get us to Deep Valley Mill, by the hou
appointed, and drive us back again salely to this house, we shall not
dispute about thc price. But remember, if you please, that the
carriage, or cart, or whatever it is, must have aecommodation for
the clild I hope to bring away with me.'
 I will take care of that, ma'am. I will put a little stool in on
purpose-and I think if 1 say two guineas, ma'am, for the job, which
is no easy one, that you can't-complain of the price.''
I certinly shall not complain of i,'' said Mliss Brotherton.
Nine o'clock was then tixed as the hour of setting out, and Mr.
Timnothsy Smith dcparted.
Mls. Prescot's roast chicken and French beans were treated very
diffcrently fom her previous brcakfast and luncheon. Mary Brotherton
was in higher spirits than she had enjoyed for many veeks-she felt
confident of success, and for the fsttime in her lie, perhaps, fully
enjoyed the possession of the wealth which gave her such power of
surmounting difficulties. The kind-hearted Mrs. Tremlett was at
length as sanguine, and almost as happy as herself; and very freely
confessed, again and ogain, that her dear yong lady knew ten times
better how to manage things than she did, old as she was.
The eveniog was again spent in a long late ramble, and though they
did not forget that over a certain towering height, pointed out by Mrs.
Prescot, lay the dismal spot cnalled the Deep Valley, the exceeling
happiness which was anticipated for one who dwelt there, male them
almost forget the misery of the rest.

MIr. Timothsy Smith was punctual to his appointment, and at a very
few minutes past nine, MIrs. Tremlett and Mlary wvere joggig along in
the miller's jockey-cart, on a seat whereon cushions, that looked very
like pillows, had been carefully strapped, and wih a litutle stool placed
before them, the sight of which conjured up so deliglhtful a picture of
the manner in which they should return, and the joy it would be her
lot to confer, and to witness, that the pretty cyes of the heiress
sparklel through tears of pleasure, and she would not have exchanged
her present expedition for the best party of pleasure that ever was
devised by man.
A considerablc part of the way was the same as that foliowed hy
MIr. Parsons when he conveyed Michael to the factory, and necd not
be again described. The tranquil loneliness of that portion of the
road which ran along the stream, before it made the turn which
brought the hideous prison-house in sight, lulled her spirits into a
state that but ill prepared her for the aspect of the grim, desolate-
looking dwelling into whose recesses she was about to penetrate;
and when it suddenly became visible, something like a groan
escaped her.
I hope that jolt idn't hurt you, ma'am ?'' said the miller, turning
towards her.  Here we are, safe and sound, and that's half my
bargain, at any rate.''
The vehicle drew up to a small door in the exterior wall of the
extensive enclosure in which the buildings staod; MIr, Smith threw the
reins upon the neck of his horse, and bringing his stout person cau-
tiously to the ground, offered his services to assist the two ladies in
doing the same.
Miss Brotherton trembled as she stood waiting till the miller's
summons at the door should be answered. Now that the moment was
come which was to decide the question of her success or failure, she
no longer felt the same confidence which had cheered her while the
trial was still distant, and her heart sunk with anticipated disappoint-
ment. Several minutes of irksome delay gave her time to dwell on
these oppressive forebodings: and when the door vas at length slowly
and cautiously opened by Mr, WYoodcomb himself, er pale face spoke
such painful anxiety, that the suspicious guardian of' the unholy spot
was comforted from the satisfactory conviction that her tale was true,
and that she came not under any false pretences to look at that which
he considered it to bhe the first duty of his life to conceal.
o MIICAEIL AISRONG.

Good morning, Smith-all's right, and all's ready for you. Walk
io, ladies, if you please,'' said the stern manager, relaxing his habitual
frown, and intendiog to be extremely gracieus.
Mlary and her friend stepped forward, and heard the stout lock anl
two heavy bolts secured hehind them.
 This way, ladies, this way, if you please; there is no neel to
trouble you to enter the factory, which, do what we will to keep it
nice, can never he quite free fcom dust. You are a trifle after your
time, Mlr. Smith, but it's no matter; dinner time is over, but if the
lalies will walk into this room they shall have all satisfaction. How-
somever, as the young uns is again at work, I can't well stop the mills
to march 'em in all together. Nevertheless, I don't see but it may be
quite as agreeable, or may be more, for the ladies to look at 'em one
Dr two at a time''
Miss lBrotherton did not attempt to speak, but plaeed herself in a
chair near the open door, and bent her head to indicate that she was
satiafied with the proposed arrangement.
 You had estf walk this way with me, Mr. fSmith,'' said the ami-
able WVoodcomb, `` the ladies look quite agitated, as is but natural,
and would sooner be without strangers I don't doubt.'' A proposal
which truly was a welcome one to all parties-for MIrs. Tremlett and
Mlary longed to be at liberty to speak without restraint-Mr. Smith was
thirsting for his accustomed mug of ale, and the manager himsell
bursting to make a few inquiries respecting his mysterious visiters.
AHuve you seen the colour of their money yet, friend Smith?''--.
were the first words uttered as they crossed the court.
 Tventy good pounds,'' replied the miller, expressively patting the
pocket wlere the treasure lay, ``and given as freely as if it had been
twenty ence-out of a full pocket-book, too, Mr. Woodcomb, I can
tell you that-and I can tell you besides, that your money's as sure as
the bank, and your customer one as is thinking of her own concerns
and not of yours.''
 That's what Im judging too, Mr. Smith. One can see in a
minute if folks eyes are roving here and there, up and down, to take
account of all they can see. God grant that thiose poor whey-faced
females may find what they want, and we shall both of us have made a
good day's work of it. I sha'n't wish the thing talked of, that's a fact,
not but what l shall be rendy with an answer, if 1'm troublel with
qnestions. People as have money to throw about, like these folks,
are not to be put off with a short word, and a lock turned in their faces.
It mayn't chance once in a century that any such should trouble
themselves concerning the cart-loads of live lumber as we takes off
to relieve the overstocked parishes. But now itis come to pass, in
course we must manage to get through it quietly-so 'm not without
my answer, Mr. Smith, if the squire should hear of it, and make
a riot.''
e No, to be sure you arn't-besides there's no need to say nothing,''
replied the niller.
Mr, Woodcomb, in answer to this, gave an assenting nodl, and an
256
THE LIPE AND ADyEURES
approving smile. : Now then, my man,'' said he, more gaily than he
often uttered any thing, `` sit you down here, and you shall presently
have a snack and a mug to keep you company. 1'Il see myself to the
turning in a few of the hands at a time, to be looked at. For I have
been thinking the matter oser, Master Miller, and I judge it will
make ten times less talk and tumult that way, than. if they were all
turned out at once. I'll have out a few boys and girls together,
chance-like, just as they come-and ten to one noebody but Poulet
will find out that there's any thing more going on than some job, as i
wants to get done.''
Mr. Woodcomb accordingly proceeded to the different parts of the
large establishment, and contrised, without stopping the work any
where, to perform the task he had undertaken. As the selected chil-
dren came forth from the varios rooms, he told them to cross the
court to the'prentice-house, where they would find one as wanted to
look at them, idding an order to come back again as quick as light,
i they didn't wish to bc strapped dead.
WVhenever such promises were made, Mr,. Wodcomb was known to
be strictly a man of his word; and Mlary and her friend had soon
gazed ith anxious eyes and shuddering hearts upon a greater number
of half-starved trembling little wretches, than could possibly have been
made to pass before them in an equally short space of time, by any
other mode or process whateer.
They came so qickly in succession, however, that no interval was
left in which Miss Brotherton and her faithful attendant could exchange
a word on the melancholy panorama of human isery that passed be-
fore them. Strange and unwonted as was the spectacle of `` two ladies
sitting in the 'prentice-house,'' the coved and frightened children, for
the most part did little more than stand before her with eyes ad
mouth wide open for a single minute, and then start off again, while
Mary herself aided the celerity of the process by a shake of the head,
and a wae of the hand, which indicatcd plainly enough that they
were not to stay, but ge.

spirits worn with repeated disappointments, and thecontemplation of
the wretched creatures for whom she knew she brught no help.
 he train seems endless1''
The old wvoman returned her a speaking look, and whispered in her
ear-'` Could you not question them, iary? light not this dismal
work be shortened by your asking them if the boy is here? They
can't have any reason to hide him. They can't be agents of Sir
MIatthew,'
Mary took the hint, and said to the next young skeleton that pre-
sented itself- Can you tell me if there is a boy here named Mlichael
Armstrong'
Thc result was a stupid and silent stare, and, without answering, the
child darted off like the rest. Thrice she repeated the question, but
with no better snccess, for two out of tle three were amoug those newly
arrived to supply vacancies caused by the late mortality, and the third

from working and sleeping in another chamber, had never heard poor
Michael's name.  No:'' was pmonouced by this one, `` No, ma'am,''
by the two new comers, and Mary's heart almost failing her, she re-.
sumed her silent examination. In truth there was in most of the
nhnppy tfaces that thas presented themselves, such a look of blighied
intellect, and dogged apathy, that she clung to tle ever-lessening hepe
of sccing the boy appear, in preference to any further questioning.-
And thus the coming ahnd going lasted for another half-hour without a
word being spoken.
At length the sad monotony of the spectacle was broken, at least to
the eyes of Mary, by the appearace of a little girl, who though pale
and lamnentably thin, had not yet lost thereby the sweet expression of
her delicnte features, neither had the soul within yielded to the para-
lyzing influence of the hopeless, helpless, unvarying misery by which
she was surrounded. Her soft gray eyes still retained their eloquent
power of speaking, and the look of surprise, mixed with something
that was almost approaching to plensure, with which she fixed them
upon MIary's face caused her to make a sudden movement to detain
her, as the child, following the example of the rest, was turning away.
At first this movemnent was caused entirely by the interest which the
little creature herself inspired-but it almost immediately occurred to
her, that here, at length, there was a chance of receiving a rational
and intelligent answer to any question she might ask:  and such
strength did this idea gain as she continued to look at the child, that
she told MIrs. Tremlett to stop the appronach of those who were eoming
on, and by keeping them waiting in the court for a minute or two, t6
give her time to see if she could not learn something from this most
interesting-looking little creature. MIrs, Tremlett showed that she toa
tlought sometling might now be hoped for, and with great alacerity
stepped out into the court to meet the fresh arrivals, shutting, to
MIary's extreme satisfaction, the door of the room behind her.
 MIy dear little girll'' said Miss Brotherton, taking the child's pale
and slender hand in hers, `` How came you in this sad place? You
do not look as if you were used to it.''
eNot for very long, ma'amn,'' was the reply.
 But you have been here during the few last weeks 2''
t I have heen here for several months,'' answered the little girl.
Can you tell me''-and MIary almost gasped as she asked the
question-': Can you tell me, if there be a boy here called Michael
Armstrong ?''
The look of modest and well-pleased curiosity wih which the soft
eye were fixed on Mary's face, was iostantly changed lor an expression
of deep anguish--for a few moments no reply was uttered, and large
tears werce already chasing each other down her cheeks before the trem-
bling child found voice to speak; at last she uttered, almost in a whis-
per, und still lookiug through her tears in Mlary's face-' Miehael Arm-
strong is dead ''
 Dead:-Oh, do not say sol'' cried Mlary, in a voice so shrill cs

paleness spread itself over her face and lipns, she seemed choking, and
perfectly unable to articulate, but clasping her hands together, and
dropping on her knees before Miss Brotherton, raised her eloquent eyes
to her face with a look which required no commentary.
Open the door, NIrs. Tremlett '' said Mary. `` Don't you hear
the knocking? Tlis is the child I shall take away with me,'' she
added in a whisper, and with a look that her friend perfectly under-
stood.
MIrs. Tremlett opeed the door, and the well-pleased Mr. Wool-
comb stood before them.
 That's well,'' he said, looking at the kneeling child, and at Mary,
whose arm encircled her neck, with an air of great compaceney. I
thought by what those said, as you sent back without looking at 'em,
that you hal found what you wanted. And now, ladies, I hope yo
remember the conditions.''
Do not doubt it, sir,'' replied Miss Brotherton, instantly drawing
forth her pocket-book. ere is a note of one hundred pounds to repay
the trouble I have given you, and here, a second of the same value
to atone for the loss of Fanny's labour.''
All right, ma'am,'' said Mr. Woodcomb, very graciously, ``and if
you had but told me that it was a little girl, with a very pretty face,
and that her name was Fanny, I could have saved you all your trouble,
for we don't happen to have another that would answer to that
description.'
Ihave taken no trouble, sir, thatI at all regret,'' replied Miss
Brotherton, `` but I am anxious to set off on my return without any
farther loss of time. WVill you have the kindness to inquire if Mr,
Smith is ready ?'
I don't doubt, ma'am. but he will be ready to obey ordenrs, though
the horse have hardly been baited well yet. Howsomever, those as
pay well generally looks to have things done in a little less time than
other folks; and it's very right and fair that so it should be. If a horse
can stand, he ought to go, if his owner is well paid-there is no doubt
of t,'
I should be sorry to distress the horse,'' said Mary, ` and if he
be not sufficiently rested, we must wait''
At your pleasure, ladies, at your pleasure. Pray sit dlown and
make yourselves comfortable. And of course your ladyship would like
to have this pretty little girl here made as decent as we can manage:
the dirtiest part of ler clothes can be changed easy, though the missis
of the 'preutice-house being latlely dead, pts us out a little in our
management. Ilowever, if little Miss Fanny, as we must call her now,
will please to come up stairs with me, lI can make her look a deal
better, I will answer for it.''
Fanny Fletcher having been raised from her kneeling position by
the hand of Miss Brotherton, still continued to hold that haind tightly,
and the young lady now felt so strong a compression of her fingers,
and was at the same time conscious of so tremulous a movcment in

the person of the child, as sbe nestled closely to her, that she felt
persuaded the proposal of Mr. Woodcomb had frightened her.
Yon are very kind,'' she replied, drawing the child, sorlid as its
wretched garments were, still closer to her, ``you are very kind, sir.
But 1 shall prefer taking her away, exactly as I first looked upon
her.''
 Dear mel only to think of that now1 That's the beauty of what's
called natural afectian1 Then if you will please to keep seated Ill
go tell Miller Smitl as you're ready, and all the business done, so as
he may set off as soon as he is able,''
Mary again thanked him for his civility, but felt disposed to think
that he might have executel his mission more satisfactorily, when he
returned in about three minutes, with the assurance tbat Master Smith
would be ready to start in little less than an hour.
An hour at that moment seemed to Miss Brotherton an almost in-
terminable spaee of time; she felt painfully conscious of being,
` confined and pent up'' with sin and suffering. Heated, agitated,
and impatient-panting for the fresh air, and longing to question her
little purchased protegee, concerning poor Michael, she determined to
walk forward on the road they had that morning traversed, and letting
Mr. Smith and his cart overtake them.
Should yu dislike walking on, Mrs. Tremlett2'' she said.  My
head aches, and 1 am sure nothing will relieve me but a walk,''
:I should like it ton, my dear,'' replied her observant com-
panion, looking anxiously in her face, and perfectly understanding her
feelings.
 WValk, ladies I'' exelaimed Mr. WVoolcomb, looking exceedingly
shocked, ` lalies such as you to walk out upon our wild moors? Oh
dearno1 That is quite impossible:'
. This was said to prove at once his tender care of personages possess-
ing the power of dispensing hundreds, and to show that he was not
unacquaintetl with the refinements of polite society; but this civilly-in.
tended opposition to their exit produced on his hearers an eflect very
different from what he intended.
That Fanny Fletcher should tremble at the mention of delay was
not extraordinary, but that Mary should hear again, in fancy, the
grating sound of the locks and bars, wshiceh had closed behind her as
she entered, and feel a sick qualm at her heart, as if she were be-
trayed, and doomed to remain in that hateful spot against her will,
showed that her nerves had indeed been severely shaken, and that her
heroism had more of zeal than strength in it.
Mrs. Tremlett, too, looked exceelingly annoyed, though certainly
without the same lively recolleetion of the bolts and bars; but she
was so accustomed to consult the wishes of her young companion, and
to feel at ease herself only when she saw her so, that she too coloured
with impatience, and sustaining almirbly her character of aunt, said,
`1 beg pardon, sir, but I know my niece's constitution so well, that I
am quite sure the jolting of that rough cart would not do for her just

at present. She is a great walker, an a mile or so, crceping along
in the fresh air, will do her a deal of gool,''
`In course you knaow best, ladies, and I can't, for certain, take the
liberty to oppose. But, by your leave, I'll just mention your plan to
Mr. Smith beforc you start, and then, maybc he'll be for pushing on
his horse a little,''
o saying, Mr. Woodcomb left them; when MIary, turning to the
litutle girl, said,  Have you any bonnet and shawl to put on, Fanny ?''
1 don't know,'' repliel the child.
 Not knaw? How can that be, Fauny ?''
 Because I have never been out of the doors since I first came
into them,'' said Fanny.
 Poor denr: I wish they woull not keep you here any longer-
this is quite intolerable I'' said Mlary, again opening the door, and
looking impatiently across the dismal court.
 Kecp me here?'' murmured the little girl, in a voicc of thc most
evident terror. ` Do you think they will keep me hete ?'
No, no, my poor child, they shall not keep you hore,'' said Mrs.
Tremlett, kindly.  Hure come the two men together.''
Fanny did not venture to look at them, but Mary did: and again, in
spite of her reason, she felt terrified at the idea that she was in their
pewer. MIr. WVoodcomb, indeed, looked smiling and obsequious as
before, but in the countenance of thc burly miller there was something
of opposition and lispleasure that she could not understand.
Setting of walking, miss, is very like bilking your driver,'' said
he, with considerably more bluntness than civility.
 wla1 does hc mean, Mrs. Temlett?'' said MIary, turing pale.
You had bettcr pay the gentleman efore you set out, my dear.
That's what you mean to say, isn't it, sir ?''
Why surcely, maam, it would be more like doing business'' replied
the man, looking a liule ashamed of himself.
Is that all?'' sid Mary, inexpressibly relieved, and drawing out
her ready purse with such cheerful alacrity, that could the hearts df
the two men before whom shc stood have been read, there might
have been found in both a strong inclination to profit by it a littlc
further.
That, I think, sir, is the sum you namel for the hire of your
vehicle ?'' said Mary, extending her hanl witih two sovcreigus towards
him.
MIr. Tmothy Smith took the money, but certainly thought that if
that sharp-eyed rogue Woodcomb had been further he might havre hit
upon some excuse for demanding more. As it was, however, he could
not enture it, and with a rather surly inclination of the head,
pocketed the gold, and left the room.
Now then, sir, if you please,'' said thc still frightencd Mary, `` we
will wish you good morning.''
Yes, ma'am, surely, yeu can go if you please. Only perhaps you
might like, for the honour of your oung relation here, to leavc some little
gratuity to be divided as a little treat amoug her late companions?''
26a
TE LIE AND ADvURES
Mary looked in his face, and the sort of half-ashamed glancee with
which the extortioner watched the effect of his wors, appeared to her
so sinister, that with a sudden feeling of something like rational alarm,
she remcmbered that she had only a few shillings left in her purse, and
that agsin to open in his presence her still well-filled pocket-book,
might be dangerous.
Aunt Tremlett, have you any money to lend me2'' she said, at
the same time drawing out again her almost empty purse. I am
very sorry I hase only these few shillings left; but I will willingly
send you five pounds, sir, for the purpose you mention, if the millenr
will take the trouble of bringing it to you.''
Oh1 It's no matter, ladies. Pray do not trouble yourselved
any more about it,'' replicd Woolcomb, keeping his eyes, however,
furtively directed towards Mrs, Tremlett, who was still engaged in
seeking for money in the recesses of a very large pocket.
I have two pounds and a few shillings, my dear,'' said the old
laly, at length placing her little leathern purse in Mnry's hand.
 That will do, that will do perfectly,'' said the worshipper of
Mammon, with an air and tone of the most amiable liberality, but at
the same time stretching out his hand, in which he received the entire
contents, uncounted, of Mrs, Tremlett's purse, which Mliss Brotherton
unclasped, anl emptied into it.
Had she studied the man's character for years, she could not have
devised any maneuvre so likely to hasten the unlocking the door
which enclosed them as thus emptying their two purses before his
eyes. He now moved forward of his own accord, drew forth from the
pocket of his coat the massive key, applied it with a large, strong, and
effective hand, to the enornous lock, drew back the heavy bolts, and
finally threw wide the hateful door.
The three females passed through it with no lingering steps, and
hearl it close heavily behind them, with feelings assuredly very dif-
ferent in degree, but in so far the same, that each one as she stepped
over the threshold, breathed a prayer that she might never repass it
again.

are happy enough to fcel that they are quitting those hileous walls for
ever, it can hardly fail to convey a sense of beauty, freshness, and
freedom, sufficient ta expand the heart with admiration and delight.
Mary felt disposed to bound along the grassy path eside thc stream
with the joyous playfulness of a child, and rather than have re-entered
that creaking door again, would have been tempted, like another Un-
dine, to plunge into the water, and take her chance of finding quarters
less hateful beneath its rippling wave. Mrs. Tremlett breathed more
freely, and seemed to have recovered the elastic step of youth, as she
moved briskly on. lut compared with what was passing iu the breast
of the ragged, dirty little creature that walked beside them, their
feelings were most earthly cold and dull. Her small hand was still
clasped in that of Miss Brotherton, who felt that the child was urging
her onward, even faster than she was inclined to go, while her head
upturned towards the towering heights which hemmed them in,
seemed eagerly secking an outlet from the region that her soul ab-
horred.
 ou are glat, denr Fanny, are you not, to know that you have
left that frightlul place?'' said Mary, kindly pressing the little emaci-
ated hand she held in hers. The child stopped short in her hurried
walk, and looking up in her deliverer's face, with a doubting anxious
look that it was painful to see, murmured very softly, and as if fearing
to be overheard from within the walls,
Shall I never, never go back again ?''
 No, never Fannyl  Do you think I would be so cruel as to take
you baek ?2'' said Mary.
I do not know if it is not all a dream,'' replied the child. I1
have dreamed that I saw green grass, and felt the air upon my face,
before.''
 Do not be afraid, FannyI You are not dreaming now,'' returned
Mary. `" Run on, and gathor that fine large stalk of foxgloe. You
never saw such a gay flower as that in your dreams, did you ?''
The little girl sprang forward, and falling upon her knees on the
grass, plucked the tall flower, and pressed it to her lips, and to her
heart. But though this was a childish action, it was not done child-
ishly: there was an appearancc of deep feeling, and even of devotion
in her look and attitude which strongly awakened MIary's interest, and
when the little creature rose again, and holding the flower in one hand,
slid the other once more into that of her new friend, the heart of that
friend yearned towards her with newly-awakened tenderness. But
when she spoke to her, and endeavoured to lead her into conversation,
the attempt entirely failed. Thoere are mny who might hase felt
disappointed and chilled by this; but MIary Drotherton had truer sym-
athy, and as, from time to time, she felt a loving contraction of
Fanny's little finger upon her own, and sometimes caught her looking
up, as if by stealth into her faco, she felt no misgivings as to the cause
of her silence, but loved her the better from knowing that her heart
was too full to speak.
They all, and as if moved by one common impulse, walkel quickly
261
TRE LIFE AD DVsNTUnES
forward as long as their road continued along the margin of the
stream; but when it turned round the steep hill's base, and began to
mount, their pace relaxed, Miary felt tlat her liule companion dragged
on her steps with Iabour, and perceived that Mrs. Tremlett was out of
breath.
Let us sit down under this ash-tree, and wait for the jolly miller,''
said Miss Brotherton, '`it cannot be ery long, I think, belore ha
overtakes us.''
Ihis proposal was the more aniable, because, in the first place,
MIary could herself have run from the bottom of that steep hill to the
top, almost without perceiving that it was any hill at all:; and in thc
next, she so exceedingly disliked both the miller and his cart, that
had she consulted her own inclinations alone, she would probably
have preferred retracing the whole way on foot.
But very gladly was her proposal for rest acceptel, by both her old
and young companion, and long did they remain seated under their
pleasant canopy before they any of them grew weary of it; till at
length, after consulting her watch, Miss Brotherton expressed a doubt
wvhether the fat miller and his lazy steed intended to overtake themn at
all.
Good gracious, my dearl do you really think so?'' said MIrs.
Tremlett, considerably alarmed. e WIIy, Miary, we shall never get
back to Mrs. Prescot's without hin 
I hope I may be mistaken, my dear old woman,'' said her kind
mistress, affectionately; ` for I fear such a walk would be too much
for you. Dut when I remember that he is paid, and remember, like-
wise, how very little he seemed actuated by any motive, save that of
sordid interest, I conless that I do think it very probable he mneans to
leave us in the lurch,''
Then let us walk on, Miss Mary, without saying a word more
about it. The shadows are beginning to grow long already, and you
shan't be kept out half the night by my laziness. Come alog, little
gil.'
Wiih these words, MIrs. Tremlett raised herself from between two
comfortable roots, which had made her an excellent arm-chair; but
the little girl whom she summoned to do likewise, though she exerted
herself to get on her feet, seemed hardly able to stand.
Miy poor Fanny, you are quite knocked up:'' exclaimed MIiss
Brotherton, looking at her with great anxiety.  How in the world
shall we ever be able to get her, on 1''
 It is only because I have not been sed to walk lately,'' snid
Fanny; '` that is, not as we have been walking now. Our work keeps
us always on our legt, and that makes them bend about so, when I
try to walk; but I can walk though it hurts me, nnd I think it wonld
be better to die outright in getting on, rather than rest. so near the
factory-so, please ma'am, Im quite ready to go on.''
And again the party set off, but the difficulty with hich the little
Fanny got along became more obvious at every step, and it soon be-
came evident that to get as far as Mrs. Prescot's would be impossible.

The dilemma was not a pleasantone. They wvere still in a part of the
road so little frequented, that it was prohable they might wait for
hours without obtaining assistance from any passer by, nor did either
Mlrs. Tremlett or Mlary recollect to have seen any dwelling nearer
than the high-rond, from which they were still at a considerable dis-
tance.
The distress of the little girl wsas painful to witness. At the very
moment when the dark cloud which hadl seemed to settle upon her
was withdrawn, and hope gradually and with difficulty, as to eyes long
unaccustomed to its light, began to reach her; at that very moment het
strength failed, and a sensation, like the sickness of death, rendered
every attempt at further exertion impossible.
``1 mnst stay here,'' she said; ` it is the will of God.''
No, no, Fanny,'' said Miss IBrotherton, seating herself bceside her,
and letting the languid liule head rop upon her bosom; `` you have
no reason to think that, while I have a thousand to believe the con-
trary. It is a most strange chance which has brought me here, and
placel you in my hands-this was by the wuill of God, and I will not
believc it has so chanced, only that I may see yon die.''
 You must not stay here,'' said Fanny, feebly; ` night will come
presently, and you must go fast to get home. Do not be sorry for me
-but, indeed, I think I am as bad as Michael was, when he fell sick,
and was carried away to die.''
Did you see-'' began Mary, eagerly ; but suddenly stopping herself,
she added, ` Not now my poor Fanny, you must not tell me about it
now-when Il have got you strong and wellat my own home, we will talk
of poor MIichael. Try now, to think how glad you will be when we have
got you homne, and all our difficulties are overt But something must
be done, l know, y poor child, before this can be. How had we
best act in this dilemma, Mrs, Tremlett? Do you think you shall have
couragc to remain with this poor ehild while I run on, and endeavour
to find some house where we may get assistance?''
 Alone, Miss Mary ?'' replicd the gool woman, looking terribly
alarmed.  How can l let you set off in a strange, wild country like
this, with noboly to take care of you? Let us go together, Mary;
nothing can hurt this little girl, you know, while wc are away.''
 Think it oer once more, dear Tremlett,'' said Mary, ``and then
I believe yon will erccive that there is more chauce of your being use-
ful to her, than to me. I shall get on faster without you, good nurse,
and with a lighter heart than if I took you for company, while this
little creature was left with nothing but her own melancholy thoughts
antd childish terrors to comfort her.'
Then I will stay,'' said the poor woman, sighing heavily: `but
just think, MIiss Mary, how I shall feel till you come back againI'
I ill not loiter to amuse myself,'' replied her young mistress with
a cheering smile; ``and now take my place, and let this poor little

Glad to find that her unexpected compaion in this most desolate
spot, was of the safer, because the eaker portion of the human race,
the wandering heiress determined to address her; but deemed it
wisest to approach her visibly, instead of startling the poor soul by
speaking to her unexpectediy from the spot where she stood. For this
purpose, she gently descended from her elevation, and making a little
circuit, presented hersclf hefore the eyes of the sun-gazer.
The old woman, for such she was, sat nose and knees together, in a
sort of hole which completely sheltered her in every direction but the
est; and from the earnest manner in which her dim eyes were fixed
on the last bright rays of the setting sun, it seemed as if her lair was
chosen on purpose to look upon it.
The appearance of Mary seemed to startle her, hut not much;: for
after looking at her for a minute as if she examined her person with
difficulty, because her eyes were dazzled by the object on hich she
had before been gaaing, she said, pointing a stick that she held
towards the point whence the bright orb had just disappearedl,
 who be you, coming to spy out old Sally at her devotions?''
I want to find a house, my good woman, for I have left a poor
child very ill at a short distance from hence; I want to find people
who can help me to remove her''
There are no people here,'' said the old woman, in a gentle but
melancholy voice, and turning her eyes round the desolate moor as if
in confirmation of the assertion.
``ut perhaps you may be able to tell me where I can find some
one ?'
O dear1 O denr1 there is no want of finding for such as you.
Just g upon the high-road an turn yourself about, and say,`Come
to me,' and you'll be seeing em flock in, right and left, and north and
south, all bowing and scrapiog as genteel as possible. 'Tis only me
as lives in a hole, and prays to the sun every night to be so kind as
not to vake me the next morning: 'tis only me that never sees any
boy. I am the only voman in all the world-all the rest have got
their death in the factories.''
There are many circumstances of more tdanger, that are infinitely
less appalling than meeting, when out of sight of every other human
being, a poor frail shattered remnant of humnanity with a disordered
wit. Mary shuddered as the wild speech of this poor creature con-
firmed the idea of insanity which her appearance suggested, and her
first impulse was to turn and run. But her steps were stayed by the
shrll, tircabling voice of the old woman., who in an aecent, the most
helpless and forlorn, called after her,
 One minute-only stay one minutel Let me look at you one
minute 1''
MIary turned again, and all feeling of terror was lost in pity as she
beheld the miserable little crippled figure which was hobbling towards
her. Her height hardly reached that of an ordinary child of tele
years old, her gait showed that her legs were dreadfully deformed, her
uncouth garments hung about her in tatters, and as she painfully
268
TIE LIFE AND  ADVENTURES
rolled herself at every step round the stick by whose aid she was sup-
portel, it was hardly possible to conceive a more complete image of
poverty and decrepitude, than her whole appearance offered.
 Do not hurry so'' cried Mary, every idea of alarm lost in con-
templating her suffering helplessness.  I will not go yet, if you wish
me to stay.'' They were now close together, and the shaking creature
looked up in her face, with a soft, silly smile, that had all the woful
innocence of ibecility. WVith a small, skinny hand that was deli-
cately pale, and perfectly clean, she took the end of Mlary 's silke scarfand
gazed upon it in asort of ecstasy. `` Oh, fine  oh, pretty, pretty, pretty ?''
she exclaimedl, smoothing and patting it with her hand, as ifit had been
a tame and favourite bird. `` I think,'' she added, with a sagacious nod,
that I know where you come from. This isjust the things, I know, that
they wear in heaven-I think l know where yotu come from.'' Then
breaking into what sounded like a genuine laugh, she again repeated,
1 think I know where you come from-that is what the overlooker
man said to me,'' she added, lowering her voice to a whisper, ``when
he caught me running away from the factory. It is not so very longage
--I can tcll you all about it, if you would like to henr-and it is not like
the rest of the things you khow,'' touching her forehead with her fore-
finger;`` I don't tell that backwards and forwards, nonsense-fashion,
like the other things I talk about-that was beat in upon my brain by
the blacksmith, and nothing can ever take it out again, they say, till
one of the angels does it in heaven. It used to pain me a good
deal,'' she continued, taking off her hat, and laying her open palm on
the top of her head, ` but since I took to sitting on my throne there,
as the folks call it, and gathered the dew morning and night to put
upon it, the pain is a deal better.''
tI cannot hear yor storynow,'' said Mary, gently, `` because there
is a paor sick girl on the side of the hill that wants me very bad-she
comes from the factory too, and she is too ill to walk-can you tell me
where I can find any hody to help me carry her?''
`` Come from the factory, is she? Denr, dear, der, dear: She
will be sure to die, you may depend pon it-they all do die, except
me. Don't you fancy that you'll ever take her hack alive, it was only
I that could bcar that, and I was bumt in the head for it, as I told
you.''
 I do not want to take her back,'' said MIary,  I want to help
her. Where do you livet Are there any houses or people near this
place? Now, e a good woman, and take me where l can find some-
body to help us.''
ees, I will,'' replied the poor creature, in a tone which convinced
Miss Broatherton that she understood her, and at the same time be-
ginning to hobble on before her towards the road.
Nothing prabably less pressing, and less hopeless than her present
position could have tempted Mary to trust herself to such a guide:
yet she felt a strange sort of confidence that the old woman knew what
she was about, and though aware that the experiment was rather a

lesperate one, letermined to follow wherever her feeble guide should
lead, certain, at least, that the distance could not be very great-
There was, howevcr, much more strength and powcr of locomotion
in the little cripple than she gave her credit for. Having contrivred to
cerawl through the grassy dyke that fenced the moor, she crossed the
road obliquely, and making her way through a very imperfect hedge
of furze and quickset, hobbled on across a bit of miserably arid stub-
ble, which presently descended abruptly, and led to a tuft of stunted
clder-bushes, beside which stood a small farm-house, with its cow-yard,
barns, and ricks.'
Surriscd and delighted to find herself so near a human dwclling,
MIary had hardly patience to restrain her steps to the pace of her poot
guide, nevertheless she had not the heart to leave her, for there was an
expression of pride and pleasure in the woman's eye as she turned
round from time to time as they advanced, which she felt it would be
most cruel to check by showing that she could do without her. So
it was togethcr that they reached the bottom of the steep descent, and
together that thay entered the kitchen of the farm-house, where a very
dccent-looking, middle-aged woman was engaged in preparing sup-
per. She looked exceedingly surprised at the appearance of Miss
Brotherton, and for a moment turned her eyes from her to hier com-
panion, and back again, with an air that was almost bewildered; but
soon recovering herself she courtesied with much respect, and said,  1
hope you haven't been scared, ma'am, by falling in with this poor
cretur? She is as harmless as a baby.''
Oh, no1'' replied Mary,' she has been very kind to me, for sho
has brought e here, wherc I should never have becn able to get with-
out her, the house is so completely concealed-and I want help, ma'am,
very much indeed.''
 You haven't met no accident, I hope ?'' snid the good woman,
kindly, and ceasing her notable operations, she drew forward a wooden
chair for her guest to sit upon.
Thank you very much,'' said the young laly, seating herself.
e Yet it is not rest I most want. I have a little girl with me whom I
have lcft by the side of the roal that lcals from the mills; she is too
weak and ill to get on, and I hope yon will be able to lend me some
conveyance-a cart, a raggn, any thing to take her as far as the
Iing's Head, three or four miles I ppose from hence, upon the turn-
pike-road: I would pay well for it.''
From the mill ?'' repeated the woman staring
Yes; from the place called Deep Valley Mill,'' replied Mary,
`` perhaps rather morc than a mile from here.''
Oh! ma'am, I know the Deep Valley Mill well enough,'' was the
answer. : AIl M, Woodcomb's own butter and milk comes from
here. Tat is not the aificulty. Bat we shant like to havse nothing
to do with carrying away any child from there.''
 You necl fear nothing on that point,'' replied Miss Brotherton,
eagerly, `` I have paid for ermission to bring this child away.''
 That alters the case for certain. bDut-I ask your pardon, maam,
270

--there is something very odd too, in such a lady as you walking
away from the factory with one of the children.''
e Indeed I do not wonder at yor saying so. But bcliee me, I
tell you nothing but the truth when I assure you that I have permis-
sion, and have paid largely for it, to bring this child away. Our un-
fortunately attempting to walk was merely accident, and occasioned
entirely by my foolish impatienee to get away from the place before
Mr. Smith, the miller, who took me there, thought his horse sufficiently
rested to return.''
MIr. Smith, the miller2 Then for certain all's right-for they be
known for the greatest of friends, MIr, Woodcomb and he-and I dare
say my husband, ma'am, would be proud to help you whcn he comes

 But I must go back to this poor child; I have left her with an
old lady, who ill, I fear, be greatly alarmed at being left so long,''
said Mary.

they had entered, had been reposing herself, by sitting on the floor,

said the woman, but by no means harshly; nnd as she spoke, she drop-
ped into the maniac's lap a piece of bread that lay in a plate upon the
table.
:Had your factory child got this now,'' said poor Sally, nodding
her head with a sort of boastful exultation, ``she would not be so
terrible bad. But there's nobody but me as gets this. I am the only
old woman in the world; all the rest die young-and most of 'em,''
she adled, in a whisper, `` bhefore they get away.''
 Was this poor creature at the Deep Valley factory when she was
young ?'' demanded Miss Brotherton.
She tells you quite true, ma'am,'' replied the farmer's wife, re-
suming her cookery, which consisted in chopping up bacon, cabbage,
and potatoes, for the frying-pan. : She talks nonsense about the
moon sometimes, and is very wild when it comes to the full, but she
never makes any blunder when she tells of her own troubles at the
factory. She neer varies the least bit in the world when she tells
about her getting away, and being stopped, and taken back again,
poor cretur. 'Tis only too true, that's the worst of it-and she has
never been in her right mind since.''
I would hear her tell it willingly, and should listen to it with great
interest,'' said MIiss Brotherton.  But at this moment I can think of
nothing but those I have left,''
 Whereabouts be they, ma'am ?'' demanded the farmer's wife.
MInry described the spot very accurately.  Why, dear mel them
surely must be the trees right against or gate,'' said the gool woman,
with great apparent satisfaction. ` And if so be as 1m right, 'tis
hardly more than a stone's throw from our back gate. I take it,

come,''
 In that case,'' replied Miss DBrotherton, grcatly comfortel, I have
no doubt that we could get the poor little girl here, and then if you
would give us leave to remain till your husband has contrived to proeure
some sort of conveyance for s, all our troubles would be over, and
most gratefully will I repay you for your assistance.''
ee I will show you the way this moment, ma'am,'' snid the woman,
with great alacrity; and once more suspending her labours for the
good man's super, she prepared to attend the lady by taking off an
external apron, and smoothing that which was below it.
Though not quite within a stone's trow, the spot to which Miss
Brotherton was so anxious to return, was reached by a very short cut
across the piece of meadow-ground on which the back part of the
farm-house opened.
The joy of Mrs. Tremlett at seeing her was geat indeed: and poos
Fanny, refreshed by the interval of rest, declaredl herself quite able to
walk ` a good piece more,''
 Poor little creature .'' exclaimed gaod Mrs. Roberts, the farmer's
wite; `` she do look bad, sure enoughlI It is seldom ornever that we
gets a sight of the children at the mill, for they sends regular for what
they wants, and bean't over fond of haing any boly go near 'em;-
but she puts me strongly in mind of old Sally's stories to be sure I1'
The little party reached the farm without dificulty, and then, indeed,
as Mary had prelicted, all their present troubles seemced over, for
nothing could exceed the earnest kindness with which Mrs. Roberts
auministered to all their wants. Mrs. Tremlett's appearance and
manner appeaed to lave entirely removel the sort of doubtful im-
pression which poor Mary's hurried entree had produced, and having
been told that the little girl had been reclaimed by them as a relation,
the whole adventure appeared to her as one of the leepest interest,
an her sympathy and good-will were most fully excited.
Old Sally was sitting upon the floor exactly where they had left her.
 Poor thing l'' exclaimed Mary, ' she has not moved an ineh.''
 Not she, poor soul,'' replied Mrs. Robherts,  ' I told her to bide
still, and when we says that to her, she'd keep still, if we was to
be away s whole day, I believe. Get up, SallyI'' she added, gaoi-
humouredly.  There's a brave womanl Look at that little girl, and
tell the lalies what she puts you in mind of.''
The expression of the poor withered, idiot facc, that was turned upon
Fanny Fletcher when this was uttered, was most touchingly sad and
solemn. The gentle, silly look, which her countenance usually wore,
was exchanged Ior one full of deep mysterious meaning. She drew
herself towards the little girl with a sort of stealthy movement, as if
afraid of being seen to approaceh her, and when quite close beside her,
said,
 ou then have done as I did-you have run away? Poor poe

little thing. Can't you guess what will come next ? Poor litle thing'
They will catch you1 hide where you will, they will catch you.''
2I have not run away,'' said Fanny, gently.
The maniac shook her head. ` Don't you scream as I did, my poor
lamb, for it's no good; they care no more for screams and groans
than for the whirring of the spindles. But the screams went into my
own ears, and I have never got rid of them since. I still hear them,
all night long, when it is moon-time. Poor, poor little girl :''
'Come, come Sally-let her alone now, she is going to eat some-
thing-''
And Mrs. Roberts completed the arrangements upon which she hal
been ocecupied since they entered, by placing chairs at the table on
which bread, butter, and cheese, were placed.
Not even did the Deep-Valley apprentice ieel more disposed to do
justice to these preparations than did Miss Brotherton and her old
servant. They had tasted nothing since breakfast, and when a bowl
of fresh milk was addel to the bresd-and-butter, MIary gratefully
assured her entertainer that she considered it as the most delicious
supper she had ever eaten,
Now that's different,'' said poor Sally, who had perched herself on
a low stool close to Fanny Fletcher.` I never had any pretty creature
like that, all clothed in heavenly trappings, giving e milk; but it
will make no difference in the end-you must be dragged back again,
poor little thing:''
No, no-she won't he dragged back again,'' said Mrs. Roberts;
`and there's a cup of milk for you-so now let the ladies eat in
peace, Sally. You know it's time for you to be crawling home-the
master will be here in no time, and maybe he will be after asking how
many stones you have picked up.to-day, so you had better be off,''
The docile creature immeliately shuffled off her stool, and prepared
to depart.
I should like to hear her describe her own adventures, which you
say she does so faithfully,'' said Miss Brotherton.  Do you think
you could persuade her to repeat her story to us 2''
Yes, yes, maam; she will do that quick enough; it is just what
she likces best,'' replicd Mrs. Roberts; ``exccptnow and then when
she is moody. Now, Sally, if you will behave yourself like a sensible
woman, yo mnay sit down again, and tell the ladies how you ran
aay from the mnill, and was caght and brought back again, and all
the rest of it,:'
The little cripple's eyes twinklel, and a gleam of intelligence
flashed across her countenance with a sort of Will.o'-the-wisp bright-
ness, as she took the fragment of a hat from her closely-shorn gray
head, and reseated herself.
`Twas my knees as was the first of it,'' she began; '`I couldn't
bear it. The pain growed worse and worse, and my legs dipped
down, and they strapped me harder and harder, and that was the
reason that I couldn't bear it. So one day,'' she continued, in a deep

clear whisper, ``one day when the 'prenticcs, and overlookers, and
manager, and all was off for dinner, I stopped behind 'em, and no-
ody seed me-no, not oneof'em. And while they were at dinner, I
slipped into the yarl where the pigs bide, and then away again, all
upon the sly, to thec door where thcy takcs the lirt out. I thought
maybc, I might have the bolts to pull, but not a bit of it-there it
stood wide onen, with a barrow full of rubbish between the posts-that
was fun1'
And here the poor creature laughed that dreadful laugh which none
but maniacs utter.
 But the fn lasted longer than that,'' she went on,  it lasted
while I creeped along fo a mile or more among the bushes as grows
so rank t'other side the mill; and there I laid down at ast in the
mist of 'em, 'cause I hearl a noise, and what d'ye think it was?
What d'ye think the poor cretur heard with hcr heart gallopiog just
at the bottom of her throat, for all the world like the flap-flap-flap
of a ly-wheel ?''
Perhaps 'twas a dog barking, Sally,'' said MIrs. Roberts, humour-
ing the maniac as she made a pause.
No1 'twas not a dog barking, nor it wasn't a wolf, nor it wasn't
a tiger; but it was something tcn million of times worser than either-
It-was-the-'printice-master :'' repnlied Sally, in a slow deep whis-
per. ' It was the divilish 'printice-master with his eyes of fire, and
his breath of flame. Oh-hI I feel him at my tlroat now1'' and she
claspel her withered neck with her pale thin hands, shuddering vio-
lently from heal to foot.
Speak soherly, Sally, ant like a sensible hody, or you must not
go en., you know that,'' sail Mrs. Roberts, interposing in a warning
tone, which poor Sally scemed to understand, for though her breast
still heaved with a panting moemnent, like one who had run a race,
and was out of breath, she assumed an affected air of composure, put-
ting her hands beforc hcr primly. and sbutting her cyes.
YIes, mississ, I know that,'' she replied, sedately,  I know that
very well, and we won't trouble Joe ploughman to help us home this
time:; but I may go on, if I speak sensible, and like a wise woman, as
I am 2''
The farmer's wife nodded assent, and Sally continued more
uietly.
t It was the 'printice-master, and none but he as dragged me forth,
head foremost, out of the bushes---very much like the butcher, you
know, my dears, when he takes the little lamb's head between his two
hard hands-l never sees that up at Tom Blake's shambles, without
thinking of it. So he dragged me back again-and then yo may
guess how the strap went1 But think of me: think what a spirit I
must hae had in those days, my dears-will you believe that I made
up my mind to start again, though I hadn't a bit of unbruised skin
upon my body ?-I did though. Oh, dear1 oh, dearl how I used
to hcar the birds singing in my ears o' nights, when I laid down, and
made elieve to sleep!  But I don't fancy it was sleep, not right

THE IFE AD ADVETURES
which though forming a very isolated episode in the history of her
journey, shall be recounted, because the fact which it brought to her
knowledge is one that well deserves publicity.
The heiress varied her road homcwards, by driving though a village
which, werc it not infested by the plague-pot of a factory, might be
eonsidered as one of thie most attractive in Derbyshire. At one
point the road passes through a rocky defile of such wild beauty, that
Mary, who was equally unacquainted with fine scenery, and capablo of
enjoying it, called to tho postboy to stop, that she might gct out and
walk up the long ascent, in order the more thoroughly to enjoy the
widely-spreading landscape it commanded. Neither of her companions
accompanied her. MIrs. Tremlett consenting, nothing loth, to remain
in the post-chaise, upon the steepness of the road eing pointed out
to her, while little Fanny, though in her heart longing to spring after
her benefactress, replied to the observation, that she was not yet
strong enough to climb, by a look that spoke more of gratilude, than
regret.
It was alone, therefore, that MIary Brotherton started forward, her
active steps soon leaving the carriage behind; when cutting short the
spiral ascent by making hcr way through the underwood which clothed
the bank, she soon found herself high above the roatd, and on a spot of
great beauly. After lingering here for a iew minutes she proceeded,
when hearing-the ever attractive sound of rushing waters, she again
stopped, and then, guided y her ear, followed where it led, till she
rcached an opening, not far from the high-road, hut apart from it,
where, instead of the mountain cascade she had expected, a spectacle
greeted her that for an instant seemed to petrify evcry nerve, and the
bounding elastic mhovement which hal brought her within sighl of it,
was changed to the rigid stillness of marble. A man, almost ferocious
in his aspect, from the squalid, unshorn, brutal negligence of decency
which it betrayed, was supporting in his arms, and on his bosom, a boy
of ten or cleven years old, whose ghastly countenance showed plainly
that death was busy at his heart.- IBefore the rock from whence flowed
the gushiig stream, whose sound had brought MIiss Brotherton to tlhe
spot, stood wvhat looked like the fragment of a rude pillar, and on this
stone the' father hal rested the wasted form of his dying child. Be-
fore him stood a little girl gazing on the boy with a mixture of iufant
fear and sisterly love, as she tended a bowl, filled from the spring, to
his lips.
 He is very iIl1'' said Mary, addressiag the father,` can I go any
where to get help for you2''
The man, who had the fragment of a pipe in his mouth, an who
looked rather bewillerel, and fiercely angry, than oppressel by sor-
row, stared at her, but answered not a word.
 What is the matter with him?'' said Miss Brotherton, addressing
the litle gisl.

it. Mother said, when we started, that he looked as if he'd uever
come back alive; but he'd have had to pay double fine if so be as
father had left him ta bide at home, so he carried him to mill; but
though they strapped him, and strapped him, he couldn't stand to his
work, and he have been lying in the mill-yard till father comed to take
him.''
This horrible statement was uttered amidst tears and sobs, but poor
MIary lost not a word of it; and as her very soul sickened at the tale,
she felt tempted to helieve that she was doomed to witness every ciz-
cumstance that could most painfully recall the source whence all her
greatness flowed.
With clasped hands, and streaming eyes, she stood silently watch-
ing the gasping breath of this young victim of unnatural labour. The
boy's eyes fixel themselves on the face of his little sister. Ile might
be listening to her history of his early fate-or he might be consciously
taking a last look at whathe loved. In either case the eflort demanded
more strength than was left him-his eyes closed, a shivering move-
ment passed through all his frame, and then he became still. The
quick, short, unequal heaving of the brcast was seen no more, and
Mary hid her eyes as the mysterious change, which no human being
can gae upon unmoved, came pon the stiffening features. It was
rather iustinct than feeling, which prompted her even at that awful
moment to profler what she had learned to know would be felt as con-
solation, did one starving member of a family alone survive amidst the
dying and the dead of a whole race. Without ventnring again to look
at the father and his son, she dropped into the bowl, which the little
girl still held, what she hated to think would soon turn natural sor-
row into unnatural forgetfulness of it: but she had no power to servre
them more effectually, and hastily turning into the road, she awaited
the slow arrival of the post-chaise in a state of mind which lefl no
faculty at leisure to enjoy any longer the hills and valleys for whose
sake she had left it.
From this time the journey homeward proceeded withont accident
or adventure of any kind, and Mlary would probably have shared the
pleasure so energetically expressed by MIrs. Tremlett at being restored
to the luxurious tranquillity of MIilford Park, had not the heavy news
she carried to the poor Armstrongs made her dread the day that
would follow her reaching it.
But how she got through that painful day, and all that resultel from
it-how little Fanny Fletcher fared in her new and most strange home,
and whether her patroness had most reason to bless or deplore the
sudden movement which had caused her to hazard the blending thus
the destiny of one so utterly unknown, with her on, must all be re-
served for future narration, as the adventures of lichael Armstrong, of
necessity, draw the pen of his historian elsewhere.

for I knows ye a deal better, old woman, than to pt any such affirant
upon ye. You just stop the creature from dying, if you can, for that
wiIl suit me a deal best just now,''
The will of Mr. Woodcomb, thus clearly expressed, was acted upon
with very implicit obedience; the consequence of which was, that
Michael Armstrong as not only saved from death, but his constitution
greatly benefited. Molly Bing had pledged her judgment upon the
result of his case, and in order to prove it correct, she contrived that
he should swallow about ten times as much nourishment as fell to the
share of any other child in the mill. Hehad growvn surprisingly during
the period of his confinement, and this gavre so lengthy a look to his
thin person, that MIolly more than once fancied the audacious little
villain would give her the lie at last: so she not only fed him, but got
leave for him to clean out the pig-sties, scrape up the flth from the
yard, and sundry other jobs of the same deseription, all of which, how-
ever unsavoury in their nature, bore, as the sharp-witted old woman
well knew, the balm of health in every movement they enforced, com-
pared to the monotonous and grinding slavery of the mill. But in
the course of a month or two, another glorious proof of England's
presperity reached the Deep Valley, in the shape of a large order, and
Mr. Elgood Sharpton, in communicating the cheering intelligence to
his manager, enforced the necessity of strenuous exertion in the
execution of it, by telling him that, sick or well, the children must
work long hours, and that it was far etter that they should a litfle
overwork the hands, than rn any risk of disappointing so valuable a
customer,
In consegquence of these instructions, Mlichael was withdrawn from
his out-door labours, and once more made to follow the mules. It
was then, and then only, that he discovered the heavy loss he had sus-
tained by the departure of Fanny. While employed upon the out-
of-door tasks assigned to him by the commands of MIolly Bing, he had
been strictly enjoined never to speak to any of the apprentices who
might chance to pass while he was at work. His meals were eaten in
MI.. Woodlcomb's kitchen, and the place assigned for his lodging by
night, was a sort of closet that opened from it. No day, no hour had
passed, unless in sleep, since he recovered his senses, without his
thinking of her. At the risk, or rather with the certainty of cuffs and
hard words, no foot-fall had ever passed within his hearing without
causing him to turn his head to reconnoitre, and much as he preferred
the labour on which he was now employel to that of the mill, he
would willingly, nay joyfully, hae exchanged it in the hope of again
seeing his little friend. It was therefore with a feeling of gladness,
instead of regret, that he received orders to turn into the factory.
 That is queerI'' thought the little fellow, as he bounded to obey
the command, with the double energy of recovetrel health, and
awakened hope, `` it is queer for me to feel glad that I am going back
to the factory:'
As it happened, he was marshalled into the same room in which he

had workel before his illness-but alas1 when he turned his eyes to
the spot whleh Fanny had formerly occupied near him, a singularly
ill-favoured boy met his gaze, instead of the pretty creature he
sought for. This was a death-blow to the joy which a few minutes
before had gisen him a gait and an expression of counteuance so
unwonted in a factory-boy returning to his well-known sufferings.
Neverthelcss, though a tear blinded the eyes which at length scttlcd
reluctantly on the broken threads which awaited his fingers, he remem-
bered that the factory had seven floors, and cruel as it was to lose the
pleasure of giving his little friend a look or a word as they each paced
their weary walk, he still thought he might get a sight of her at thein
dismal meals, and fancied that he should not greatly regret exchanging
scraps of wholesome meat, for musty oatmeal, provided Fanny
Fletcher was by to tell him not to mind it. DBut the musty oatmeal
came all too son, for no word or look of Fanny's came with it: nor
did any uncertainty long remain, on which to hang a lingering hope
that some unfinished task detained her in the mill, and that he should
see her soon. His first question, whispered to the girl who sat beside
him, brought forth the history of Fanny's wonderful leparture, at as
full length as the time and place would permit. At first he listened to
it with incredulity. It scemed, he thought, like a story made up to
deceive him, for fun; and little as the blighted young spirits of that
sad iraternity were given to jesting, Michael clung to the belief that
such was the case, as long as the meal lasted. But, as sual, a few
minutes followed, during which they were loft alone-an indulgencee
which necessarily arose from the fact, that even the niggardly allow-
ance of time awarded by the regulations of Mr. Elgood fSharpton for
their meals, was more than the famished children required for devour-
ing the scanty portion se hefore them. No sooner had Mr. Poulet
withdrawn himself, after witnessing the orderly consumption by each,
of the allotted morsel, than such of the miserable crew as had sur-
vived the pestilence, and remembered the close alliance between Mi-
chael and the heroine of the marvellous tale which was still in every
mouth, all rushed togcther towards him for the purpose of reeounting
it. Notwithstanding the confusion of tongues, their noisy testimony
was too consistent to admit of doubt, and MIichael remained with the
astounding belief that his little friend was taken away to e made a
great Iady of.
The heart of Michacl Armstrog proed itself to be a very generous
one on this occasion.
Same atural tears he shed, but wiped them soon.'
as he remembered that the more miserable the situation in which he
was left, the more he ought to rejoice that Fanny had been taken from
it. And he did rejoice; truly, sincercly, and at thc very bottom of his
henrt did he rejoice. As day after day the hatetul routine of unva-
rying sufering again laid its grasp upon his existence, with a pover as
irresistible as that of the vast engine wbich within those prison-walls


284
TEE LIFE AND ADvEFES
This resolution was not very steadily adhered to; but the struggle
to do it, which was perfectly sincere, made the poor boy moody, and
more miserable than ever. His dreams perpetually represented to him
is mother and helpless brother, suffering Irom some unkindness from
Fanny, whom he saw superlatively beautiful, and superlatively rich,
but more superlatively hard-hearted still. These nervous and irritating
isitations brought his mother and brother so vividly before him, that
for weeks he could neer, whether waking or sleeping, get them ou of
his head. He fanciel himself again running at full speed from Dow-
ling Lodge, with MIartha's basket on his arm: his mother's little room,
decent anl orderly in spite of poverty, came back upon his mind as if
he had left it but yesterday. Ile saw the soft expression of her faded
countenanee, and telt the welcome of her fond embrace.
Oh, fool oh, proud and wickel fool1'' he murmurel to his
tear-stained pillow, as these, and a thousand other tender recollections
presscd upon him. e WYhy could I not endure the tyrant's cruelty? 1
might have kissed her nowl I ight havse comlforted poor eddy.''
The sound of his own voice as he pronounced this dear familiar name,
though iu a whisper too low to awaken the weary sleepers round him,
wrung his very heart by the vivid recollections which it brought, and
though he was now beyond fourteen years old, he ceried himself to
sleep.
Fiful and feverish were the transitions of his mind at this period.
fSometimes he persuaded himself that his mother was no more, that the
loss of him had broken her heart, and that she had died, believing him
to have gone before her, At other times it was Edward whom he wept
as dead. His shattered health, his feeble limbs were., as he thought,
sure evidence that nature meant him not to strugglelong against the
misery of his lot, and there were moments in which this persuasion
even soothed him.
e Sweet fellow 1'' thought he.  How calm and beautiful he must
have looked in deathl Even in suffering, even in agony, his coun-
tenance was lovely-so patient, and so heavenly mild1 Better, far
better he should die, than live a factory-boy like me1''
And then again his mood would change, and he had for ever before
him images of the most fearful destitution-his mother starving, and
Edward slowly perishing beside her, because he had been too proud
and too impatient to endure suntdry buffetings nd other indignities,
which, when put in competiion with the thought of baving injured
them, dwindled into petty injuries, which he deserved eternal shame
for shrinking from.
Dreadful were the hours he thus spent: and, fearful to think of, was
the hopeless, helpless, joyless, comfortless existence by which he held to
earth His very soul sickened as he looked around him, and read in
every withered melancholy face the history of blasted youth, and the
prophecy of prematre death.
lBut there are spirits which sorrow and suffering cannot quench, and
Michael Armstrong's was one of them. Nature nnd aecident togethe

the fact was completely ascertained and known to nearly every inmate
of the mill.
Mr. Poulet's second wife, to whom he had then been married about
three years, was in appearance the very reverse of the first, being as
remarkably small, as the other was large. bBut what she wanted in
muscle, was ade up in watchfulness. Nothing escaped her restless
and malignant little eyes, and either from the incessant danger of hen
spying sharpness, or the propensity of the human mind to think pre-
sent suffering worse than every other, there were many who declared
they would be glad to have her brutal predecessor back again. It
wras this woman who first descried the absence of Michael from the
board.
eHallo: where is No. 57 ' she cried.
No one could answer; and No. 5 was sought for in vain from one
end of the premises to the other.
e WHe is gone through the yard-door I'' proclaimed the active and
intelligent MIrs. Poulet, after discovering that the bolt was with-
drawn.  Of with you, you stupid old fool '' she added, addressing
her husband;  what d'ye stand staring there for? If you had the
wit of a jackass, you might trace him by his feet on the des-for there
are the marks plain enough to any body, that has sense enough to
look for 'em.''
nd so in truththere were. A continuous track of footmarks, ere
easily traced from the door to the steep bank beind the factory,
where they were lost in the covert of bushes, which had of late years
been coaxed to clothe its sides for the purpose of furnishing fagots.
That some one had recently broken through these bushes was equally
evident, from many boughs having been torn, and the soil beneath
them trampled. This was enough to direct the pursuit, with so much
certainty of being right, that Mlr. WYoolcomb laughed as he gave the
orders for it.
The bushes last for about half a mile,'' said he, `` and then he
must take over the hills, of course' Fine fellow, isn't he? It will be
mighty hard to take him again, won't it? There's only three justices
of peace for him to be handed to, and only every man he meets ready
to introduce him. The worst misfortune is, that I don't quite see
where he is to get his dinner,''
Two stout overlookers started accordingly upon the track thus easily
hit upon, and Mr. Woodceomb awaited the result of their exertions
without the slightest anxiety, or any irritation of nerves whatever;
albeit he knew that, favourite as he was, he might run no small risk of
Iosing his place, should one of the apprentiees really escape-but the
thing was impossihle; no one conuld live without eating, not een one
who had served his apprenticeship to staring as well as piecing at the
Deep Valley Mill. So Mr. Woolcomb lept soundly, although in
ignorance of the fact that MIichael Armstrong was already within a
few feet of his premises.

I is now necessary that the narrative should briefly return to the
period of Miss rotherton's arrival at Milford Park, after her unsuc-
cessful expedition in pursuit of Michael.
There was no needless delay between this return to her home, and
the communication to MIrs. Armstrong and Edward of the dismal news
of which she was the bearer: nor was there any consultation on this
occasion, concerning the mode of her reaching Hoxley-lane. Poor
Mary had greatly advancel in independenee of spirit within the last
few months; and had she eneountered all the military quarterel with-
in twenty miles, with the Dowling family marching in procession at
their head, she would have quietly driven through them all, with the
carriage-windows up, perhaps, but with no greater precaution-except,
indeed, an order to the eoachman to drive on without stopping, let
them meet who they would.
The carriage was at the door the morning after their return, and
MIiss IBrotherton had not yet named her intended expedition to Mrs.
Tremlett.
 You are geing out without me my dear?'' said the old Iady on
hearing it announced.
I am goiug to the widow Armstrong's, lear nurse,'' replied the
heiress. t Your presence cannot help me through this dreaded visit.
Then why should I make you share the pain of it2''
 WVhy ? my dear because I am of no earthly use, and had better die
at once if I cannot be of some little comfort to you at such a time as
this. Why, don't I know all about it, and how you must feel at this
very moment, just as well as you do yourself, Mary Sure it was a
foolish notion to leae me here enjoying the arm-chair and the foot-
stool, and the flowers, while you are having your heart broken by
telling that poor pale body, that the child she loved so dearly is dead
and gone for ever,''
Itf' you could save either her or me a pang, nurseTremlett, I would
not thus have spared yo,'' repliel Miss Brotherton. ``However, you
shall go with me, dear friend. It is quite like yourself to wish it--
and in truth, I might have guessed that you could not have remained
easy and quiet at home while I was so engage. And poor kFannyl
--I have left her very busy wvith Martiu, assisting in araning the

we are going, in case she should come in here to look for us ?''

all over again; for of course, when MIrs. Armstrong hears that you
have got with you the only person who can tell any thing about her
boy, she will be restless and anxious to see her-and then won't it be
all over again, Hlary 2'
It will, indeed, dear nursel Yonu are very right, and very wise in
this. She shall go with us, poor child. Though it will be a drealful
task for her'' replied Mary.
And you would rather take it, dear, all on your own shoulders ?
I do not doubt that-only you don't know how to manage it,'' replied
Mrs, Tremlett.  But there is another thing, MIary, that I have been
thinking of,'' continued the kind-heartel old woman, '' and that is the
other poor boy. Ill engage t say, he has never missed school for an
hour, after what you said to him about exerting himself. I saw how
he took it; and, therefore, you may depend upon it, that he is at the
schoolhouse now. Then just think, my dear, what his going home will
e after you have told all Poor creaturesl Ilt makes one's heart
sick to fancy itl If I were you, Mlary, I would send for him, tell him
every thing at onee, and then take him home to his mother.'
MIiss Brotherton instantly rose and rang the bell.
Do uot say you are of no use, my dear good creature l'' said she.
 HIow infinitely better this will be than the hurried, houghtless plan
which I had sketchely
A message was accordingly espatched to the schoolhouse to sum-
mon Edward Armstrong, and in a few minutes he stood before them.
Most true is it that there is something holy and imposing in the
presence of sorrow. It would be difficult to imagine any entree into
the boudoir of Miss Brotherton, which would have inspired a feeling
both in her and her friend so nealy approaching ae, as did that olf
Edward Armstrong.
 There is no need to tell him, poor fellow I'' exclaimed Mrs. Trem-
lett, mournfully shaking her head, as she saw the sudden and eloquent
change in Elward's countenance the moment he lookel in the face of
Miss Brotherton.  There is no need to tell him1 He knows it all,
already I'
IlIe is deal, thenl'' said the oy, his pale lips parting, as it
seemed, with difficulty, to pronounce the words, `` Please, ma'am, lct
me go away.''
He looked as if he were unable to sustain himself;: and MIary,
really fearing he might fall, started from her seat, and throwing her
arms round him, almost carried him to the sofa.
No, no, my poor Elwardt'' she said, ''o not go away. Stay
with those who love and pity youl Poor Michael is dead, Edward,
and we must all try to support your mother under the dreadful
news.''
How do you know he is dead?'' cried Edward, starting up, and
looking almost sternly at his benefactress.  How do you know that
they have not hid him away where you cannot find him, that they may
torture him, and work him rto the bone, when there is noboly by to

:1 know that he is dead but too well, Edward,'' replied Mary,
gently. 1 have brought home with me a little girl whio worked in the
same factory, and who knew him well. IIe died of an infeetious fever
that kille many, any more. I am going to take this little girl with
me to your mother, Edward, that she may question her, if she wishes
it, about poor Michael, and I wish you to go with us, my lear boy; it
is better that your paoor mother should have you with her.''
You are going to tell mother ?'' said the boy with a shudder.
 Yes, Elward 1-it must he done, and the sooner it is over the
better. Your mother is a good woman, and a pious Christian, my
dear boy. She will know and feel that all that can befall her is the
will of God; and when she remembers this, she will rise above her
sorow, and thinking of the better world hereafter, will be able to say,
His will be done'''
 Yes, ma'am-if it does not kill her first,'' answered Edward.
Indeed, I think a great denl will depend on yow, dear Edward, as
to her manner of bearing it. If she sees you sink, be sure she will
sink too; but if you make her feel that she has still a beloved child ta
live for, to whom life may yet be a blessing, she will cease to repine
for the loss of one child, for the sake of making the other happy.''
Edward slowly and silently shook his head; but after the melan-
choly silence of a minute or two, he said, I will do my best,
ma'am,''
The scene which followed beside the bed of the poor widow, was
one of such deep, but patient sorro, as left an impression never to
be forgotten on the minds of those who witnessed it. Mary's counsel
had not been thrown away upon Edward. The boy displayed both a
delicacy and firmness of character beyond his years, and above his
education. No ordinary topics of consolation were clumsily uttered
to redeem his plelge to hMary, nor did he affect a stoical indifference
which he could not feel; but with gentle endearments he drew the
mourning mother to think of him, and there was healing, as well as
agony, in the tears she shed upon his bosom.
O all this Fanny was a silent, but deeply-moved spectator. The
widow gave her one earnest look when Mary said,  This little girl was
the last person who spoke to Michael before he was laid on the sick
bed from whence he never rose, and she seems to have loved him
deatly.''
One long earnest look was turned upon her when this was said, but
no word was spoken to her, for the time was not yet come when the
hereaved mother could seek comfort in any thing. Nevertheless, when
Mliss Brotherton rose to go, and pressing the hand of the poor suflerer
in her own, promised to pay her another visit soon, MIrs: Armstrong
murmured in her esr,  I should like to see that little gisl again,
when I can bear to name him.'' Mary nodded her assent, and left the
mother and son to exclange thoughts and feelings, which, when deep
and genuine, must ever be held sacred from every unkindred eye.
Most watchfully did Mary attend to this poor pensioner: and many
were the hours during which she sat, reading the book of lifte beside

to watch some favourable moment, she might have the surpassing joy
of seeing his hoart open to the truth, and in a state to permit her help-
ing to lead him to efficient repentance, and theall-merciful forgiveness
of God. It was impossible but that such thoughts and feelings tust
separate her, more than ever, from the rest of her family, and she had
already pretty generally received the epithet of methodistical, from
the whole ncighbourhood: but she hailed it as a blessing, and without
a shadow of religious enthusiasm, beyond what was almost inevitable
under the circumstances, and witht no sectarian vicws or notions what-
ever, poor Martha gladly sheltered herself under the imputation of both
in order to avoid joining in scenes of amusement for which she had no
relish,
In such a state of mind it was nntural enough that Miartha should
deem a visit to the bereaved mother a penance which it was her duty
to perform (though it was more painful to her, perhaps, than almost
any other to which she could have been subjected), and she did per-
forn it accordingly. She found tho poor sufferer, whose eye she
dreaded to meet, sinking fast into peace and rest, that never more could
bc disturbed, MIiss Brotherton and Fanny were both with her; a
bible was in the hands of the former, and MIrs. Armstrong's counte-
nance, though greatly more pinched and pallid than she had ever be-
fore seen it, expressed a tranquil calmness which it was impaossible to
contemplate without pleasure.
But, alas: for poor Marthal she had the pang of seeing this con-
soled and consoling look suddenly changed to an expression of intense
suffering, the moment her own person met the poor woman's eye.
They had never seen each ather since the fatal morning on which
Martha had so innocently persuaded her to sign the articles of her boy's
apprenticeship, and the recollection of that scene, and all its con-
sequences, could not so suddenly come upon onc, rednced already
t almost the last stage of wcakness, without shaking her terribly.
The distended eye, the open mouth, the heavsing breast, all spoke a
egree of agitation, which in her condition was frigltfully alarming:
and Mlary, who dreaded lest the calmness of her last moments should
be disturbed, hastily turned to thc intruder, and said, ' Go, gol-
the sight of you will kill her1'
Though there was no more of harshness in this, than the urgent cir-
cumstanees of the case seemed to call for, MIary Brotherton would
have rather died than utter it, could she have guessed the pang it
gave to the already wounded heart of poor Mlartha. She made no re-
ply; but, fixing on the victim of her most innoeent delusion, a look,
just long enough to impress the terrible expressian of her countenance
pon hcr own heart for over, she turned away, and rcached hcr splen-
did home in a state of minl that seemel fearfully to verify the annun-
ciation,`` He will visit the sins of the fathcrs upon the children.''
That day was the last of the widow's life, and it is probale it might
have been so, even if Martha Dowling had not made her `unfortunate
visit; but the coincidcnce was fatal to the poor girl's peace, for the
anxious inquiries she madc respecting her, brought the intelligence of

neighbourhood, and for several months after her return she contented
herself with following Mr, Bell's prescriptions, for friction and moderate
exercise, withoute calling in any medical assistance atall. But though
the improrement that followed was very perceptible, it was not rapid,
and the idea of London advice suggestel itsell, as the most satisfaciory
mode of ascertaining at once whether a perfect recovery might be hoped
for; information which it was very desirable she should obtain, before
she decided in what way she should bring him up. Since the death
of his mother, Milford Park had been Edward's home, and tle orphan
boy's hold on Miss Brotherton's warm heart had been greatly increased
by the opportunities this gave her of more frequent intercourse with
her. In truth, though he still attended the school for an hour or two
every morning, by far the more important portion of his education went
on under her own eye, and, as well as that of his little companion
Fanny, was beginning to take a form and extent taotally different from
what she had at first intended for either of them. ldeas respecting
them both, began by degrees to arise in her mind, which she at first
endeavoured to resist, as being too much out of the usual course to
he safely indulged in: but '` nse lessens marvel,'' and the notion of
making a man of learning of Edward, and a wvoman of fortune of
Fanny, which once and again she had rejected, as too romantic and
absurd, gradually grew into an habitual theme of meditation on which
her fancy delighted to fx itself.
Mary Drotherton was at that time about twenty-two years old, ex-
trcemely pretty, and moreover almost childishly young-lookiag for her
age; andwhatever she might have brought herself to think of it, most others
would very naturally have deemed her adopting a boy of twelve, and a
girl of eleven, a most outrageously preposterous and imprudent act.
IBut her situation was one in most respects quite out of the common
way, and she every day felt it more impossible that she could continue
to endure the station of one of the magnates of a manufacturing neigh-
bourhaol, with all eyes fixed upon every thing she did, and her whole
heart and soul recoiling from companionship with the only persons
whom her neighbours and watchers would deem fit to be her particular
friends.
The heart of this isolated girl was so clingingly affectionate that it
is probable she would, under almost any other circumstances, have at
least loved the beautiful mansion in which she had passed the greatest
part of her life, and felt the trees and flowers that adorned it to be as
companions, and familiar friends; but a thousanl painful thoughts
were mingled with the consciousness that she was mistress of that fair
domain; and the very fact that the education she felt inclined to be-
stow upon the two orphans would bring down upon her the criticisms,
and probably the reprobation, of the hole neighbourhood, making it
very desirable that the extraordinary project slould be carried into
execution elsewherce, was in her estimation more in its favour, than
agains it. When, in addition to all this, she succeedcd in persuading
herself, from some of her miscellaneous reading, that there were Ger-
man baths which might assist the restoration of Edward's limbs, and
296
E LIPE AND ADVEURES
that it was her duty to consult the most approved authorities upon his
case, the lecision to leave MIilford Park, and remove to London, was
at no great distance.
Had her valued friend and counsellor, Mr. Bell, led her to believe
that all the wealth she had, if thrown back among the class from which
it was drawn, could have sufficed to remedy the esils under which they
groaned, she was quite capable of stripping herself to her last shilling
for the purpose; but he knew better, and he taught her to know better
too; and having convinced himself that hes best chance of happiness,
as well as her best opportunity of doing good, would be in yielding to
the afeetion which  her boy and girl'' had inspired, he promised to
assist her projected removal, by seeing that the orders she left, respect-
ing her property, were faithflly executed: and, about eight months
after the death of Mrs. Armstrong, the heiress left her parks and
gardens, her splendid mansion and all its gorgeous appurtenances, to
attend the orphan boy to London.
The consultation which, immediately after her arrival there, took
place pon the case of Edward, was productive of, perhaps, the
greatest pleasure MIary had ever known; for the sentence unanimously
pronounced was, that the limbs of the boy were in a state of progress
towards perfecet recovery, the weakness and distortion brought on by
his cmployment, not haring lasted long enough to produce any de-
formity, capable of resisting the tendency of nature to recover herself,
if not impeled by any fresh unhealthy influence. Tht any such
should arise to disappoint her hopes was not likely: all that was re-
quired for him being good air, regular and moderate exercise, whole-
some food, and abstinence from all violent exertion for the next year
or two. As to her question respecting German baths, the ansver
was less unanimous:; two gentlemen being of opinion that they would
do no good at all; two that it yas doubtful whether the case would be
affected by them or not; and one that great henefit might probahly
ensue. But as all were of opinion that change of air was desirable,
and as a pretty strong inclination to try fresh fields and pastures new
seconded this judgment, Mliss Brotherton determined to start for the
Rhine. MIrs, Tremlett declared that she had not the slightest ob-
jection to foreign parts; Edward's heart swvelled with an ccstasy made
up of gratitude, hope, curiosity, andthe delicious exhilaration attendant
upon relurning health; while Fanny looked around her, and listened
to every one whose words referred to the expedition, with a very de-
lightful consciousness of bheing wide awake, but not without somne fear
that she was dreaming, nevertheless.
Such was the party that filled the travelling-carriage of Miss Bro-
therton, while an English maid, a French footman, and a German
conrier, formed her suite.
Nothing, certainly, could be well more whimsical than the party
witl which she had thus surroundel herself; but this mattered little,
since she was pleased with it-and we must leave her in the full enjoy-
ment of a whole host of delightful feelings, while we return to follow
the fortunes of poor lichael.

Wmi this gay and happy party, who would any of thcem have
gladly exchanged pleasure for pain, could they,thereby have purchased
only the knowledge of his existence, were thus placing kingdoms be-
tween them, the unhappy Michael was still enduring all the miseries of
an apprentice at the Deep Valley Mill.
It would be difficult to imagine a stronger contrast in the situation
of two brothers than that which many subsequent years presented be-
tween him and lElward. Edwardl-who had ever been to him as a
dearcr sccond self-who had never enjoyed a pleasure unshared by
him, and never known a sorrow that had not also been his-Edward was
enjoying all that nature and fortune could give; while Michael still
hopelessly dragged on a wretched existence amidst unceasing and un-
arying sufferingl At length the desperate resolution was formed
which put the officials of the Deep VWalley factory in the state of
activity already described. And where was Mlichael the while?
Safely ensconced in a sort of rude drain, which he had himself
assisted to construct, when he held the regretted office of scavengetr
of the court, and over the aperture of which he easily arranged sticks
and rubbish sufficient to conceal him, Mlichael lay for many hours
listening to the hubbub which his absence occasioned. He distinctly
heard the expression of Mrs, Poulet's anger and scorn, as messenger
after messenger returned, without bringing tidings of him: and had,
moreover, the advantage of knowing the track that he had purposely
mude on the grass which grew tall and rank immediately behind the
factory, had led them, and would continue to lead them, all one way,
while he would of course take esptecial care to go another.
IIaving left his foot-marks on the grass in the manner lescribed,
Miehael had scrambled through the bushes which covered the steep
hill-side, for the distnce of a few hundred yards, and then, taking
advantage of a layer of stones, by which a patch of marshy ground had
been rendered firm, he again crossed from the hill towards the factory
without lcaving any trace behind. By this simple device his pur-
suers were compietely thrown out, for when night came and he crawled
out from his shelter, no eye was open to look for him close to his
prison-walls, though very keen ones were busy elsewhere in scarch of
him.
The same strength of frame which had enablel him to escapc de-
formity in the mill, helped him well now, as without fool, without

 Died :'' echod Michael, looking wildly at her. Is he dead
too?' Is my poor Teddy dend2'
Sure-ly he is,'' replied the unthinking young woman, who, in
truth, kew nothing about either the widow Armstrong or her son, but
remembered hearing that a little more than a year before she took
possession of the premises, a wido Armstrong had died in the back
room, for grief at having lost a boy. She was far from intending te
be cruel to the poor lal, who lcoked himself so very nearly like a
corpse, but was too indifferent upon all subjects which did not imme-
diately concern herself, to take the trouble of thinking before she
spoke.
A few more questions might probably have obtained, if not the
truth, at least some proof of his informcr's ignorance of it, but
Michael ha heard enough: he rosc to his feet, and without uttering
another word, rushed out of thce room.
Thestate in which he then found himself was certainlynearlyapproach-
ing to delirium. kis strength of body and mind completely exhausted
by fatigue, fasting, and intense anxiety, the blow which had fallcn
upon bim was heavier than hisreason could bear, and he wandered
forth into the fields without knowing where he was, or having any dis-
tinct idea of what had befallen him. IIis devious and unheedel
path led him to a spot, at the distance of nearly a mile from his former
home, at which several miniature rocks of sandstone give samething of
wildness and dignity to thc little stream, which for the most part runs
tamely enough, and looks little more than a wide and dirty ditch, as
it passes though the town of Ashleigh. A multitude of cotton-
factories, with their tall chimneys mockiug the heavens, were visible in
the distance, on the other side, and the boy stopped in his wild, hur-
ried walk, to gaze upon them, with a feverish consciousness that there
at least stood something he had seen before. A frightful Ilash of
memory- then shot across `his brain-his mother dead-his darling
Edward dead-himself a houseless, friendless, starving wretch, who
soon would be caught and carried back to the prison-house he had
ran fram only to learn that he had no friend on earthl Such were the
thouhtewich rackel him, as he stood upon the edge of thc rocky
little precipice, and fixcl his eyes upon the quiet water that flowed
sometwenty feet benenth him. It seemed to present an image of
coolness and repose'; his burning lips longed to kiss the gentle ripple
on  its surlace-he drew nearer to the extremest verge.

sick headresled,  God forgive mei' he adlecd, raising his eyes to
heaven. IBut if I lrown,'mother: I shall go to theet'' and as he
spokc the words, he sprang forward, and plunged into the stream:
The shock restored his wandering senses in a moment; he felt that
he was perishing, though nconscious that it was by his own act:; and
forgetting how little rcason he had to wish for life, struggled hard to
grasp a bush that protruded from the bank into the stream. But he
could not swim, and thc efforts he made, though they served for a
minute or to to keep himaloat, only inereased the distance between

himself and the object he endeavoured to rech. His heavy shoes
filled with water, and dragged him downwards-his strength failed,
his arms ceased to movc, and in another moment the water rippled
over his head.
ut poo Michael's history was not finished.yet. A heasy-looking
elderly man, who had as little as possible the air of one desirous of.
seeking an adventure, was in the act of examining some sheep in a
field, the fence of which was not filty yurds from the rocky ledge from
whence the boy had sprtng. Having completed his survey, andt di-
rected two men who were with him to select a score or two from the
lot, the old man reposed himself upon a style in the fence above men-
tioned, and having chanced to turn his head from the sheep, towards
the spot where Mlichael stood, had watched for a minute or two the
boy's agitated mtovements and lemeanour, but withut the slightest
suspicion of the frightful catastrophe that was to ensue.
No sooner, however, did he hear the splash occasioned by the
plunge, than he sprang over the style with the activity of a younger
man, and calling to the others to follow him, made his way with little
loss of time, to a bit of pebbly ground on a level with the stream, and
at no great distance from the point at which Michael had sunk. But,
short as the time had been, the ripple had already disappeared from
the surface of the water, and no trace remained of the object of his
search. The two young men whom he had summoned to follow him,
though they had not seen the aecident, had gathered from his words
that something terrible had occurred, and clambering down the rocky
cliff, were by his side in a moment.
It is too late, lads1'' exclaimed the old man, wringing his hands
together. `' I saw the poor distracted creature take the leap, but he
was sunk before I gaot to the bank, and lI take it he will never rise
again. I shall never forgive myself for not going to him when I saw
him throwing his arms about in that wild way. I might have guessed
what was going to happen-and may Heaven forgive me for not pre-
venting it1''
 Tis a man who has thrown himself in ?'' inquired one of the men.
t Not a man, but a fiue young lad as ever you see. Poor fellowl
Twas early days for him to have found sorrow enough to throw
bimself out of lifte that way1 It I had ran to him, as l ought to have
done, and stopped the deed, who knows bnt we might have brought
him round to a better manner of thinking ?''
 'Tis ten to one but he'll come to the top again yet, if he hasn't
done it already,'' said the man.
But if he comes, he'll come dead, William t'' replied te old
Inan.
I don't know that,'' rejoined the young shepherd.''  The stream
runs briskish round yon coruer, and would carry him right away with
it; but it's worth while having alook lower down. If he rises at all,
twill be there.''
And so saying, the young man set off at a swifter pace than his
master could follow him ; while the old man and the other shepherd-

ays of yore, but not one of them recognised the widow Armstrong's
boy, in the long-limbed, pallid fgure, that they now gazed upon
Muster Thornton, the Westmnorland yeoman and farmetr, was too
substantial a customer to be refused any reasonable favour, and the
ggged, dripping MIichael was not only permitted to lie down on
Muster Thornton's bcst of beds, but accommodated promptly with dry
linen, and duly comforted with more hot brandy, water, sugar, and
biscuits than he had any inclination to swallow. He took enough,
however, to remave the faintness of inanition; and this, together with
dry Iinen, and a bed, sufficed, in spite of the heavy sorrows upon
which his mind had not yet dared to fix itself, to sooth him into a
long and healing sleep.
WVhen he awoke from it, he was capable of answering all thce
questions Mr, Thornton put to him, and this he did with a simplicity
of pathos that went straight to the good man's heart. That he had
been working in a distant cotton-factory, where he had been very
hardly treated, and having got awray to see his mother and his brother,
had found them both dcad, was a tale, that if it could not excuse the
desperate act which he had attempted, at least aceounted for it, in a
manner that left as much to pity as to blame.
Poor hoyl poor boy I'' exclaimed the old man, with tears in his
cycs. `' I1 was wrong and wicked, very wrong and wickedlI but you
must pray God to forgive you, my bay, and never think of any such
desperate doinga more.''
 1 did not know what I was about, if I remember rightly,'' said
Michael. : My head seemed gone. I don't know how I got to the
river, but I am sure I did not go there on purpose.''
tSo much the better-lI am gglad to hear it-and it's no great won-
der, sure cnough, if you did lose your head, coming to such a home
as that. But what are you to do next, my poor fellow2 I suppose
there is no other home for you, is there?''
I have no home, nor a single friend in the whole world,'' rcplied
Michael.
 And the only work you have ever been used to, I suppase, is fol-
lowing the wheels in the factories ?'' said the farmer.
 IExeept once for three months and a bit that I was kept to cleaning
the outhouses and yar, and wheeling away garden-rubbish and such
like,'' rcplied Michael.
 WVell, but thats better than nothing, boy. At any rate, you know
how to hold a spade, which is a long deal better than having never
used your fingers, except for tying bits of thread. D'ye think you
should be willing to work for me, my boy, and tend my farm-yard
stock, and do a turn of work in the fields when it was wanted ?''
I should be willing, sir,' replied Michael, while a flush passe
over his pale face, `` I should he illing and most thankful to work for
you.''
 That's well,'' said the old man cheerily, `` and as to terms, I don't
expect we shall finl much difficulty; you will come to me my po
fellow, much in the same condition as yo first come into the world,

It will be a blessed bargain for me, sir,'' said Michael, ' if you
will add to all your goodness the excusing my ignorance. But if
will was all that was wanting to make a good servant, you should not

'' And will is all that is wanting, boy. You are no fool, I take it,

 Well, then, Michael Armstrong, I am your mastcr, and you are
my man And now you must eat, and then you must go to slecp
again, I think, till I havre got somne decent clothes for you. Those you
wore yesterday have had a good washing to be sure. Nevertheless, I
don't justly like the looks of them.''
WVthin six months from this time, Michael Armstrong, promoted ts
a place of trust, might have been seen sitting upon the hill-side in one
of the most romantic spots in WVestmorland, a shepherd's maud
wvrapped round his person, a sheep-dog at his feet, and his master's
flacks nibbling the short grass aronnd him on all sides. Nany were
the solitary hours he thus passed, and vary rich was the harvest they
brought him. Had the boy cemained a year or two longer in the state
that

had Michael remained a ycar or twso longer at the Deep Valley fac-
tory, in the state thus admirably and accuratcly dcscribcd, it would
have been too late for any contemplation of God's works to havc
roused his withered spirit to worship and to hope. But as it was, his
mind seemed to awaken day by day from the long and heavy sleep in
which it had been plunged. Wth an intellcct naturally vigorous, and
covctous of acquirement, and having had his first infant strctch of
thought happily and indelibly direceted, though wih primeval simpli-
city, to one God and father of all, his transition from a condition in
which

was rapid and delightful. His heavy losses were not forgotten; but
while he meditated beneath the bright arch of heaven on the mother
and the brother he had so fondly loved, there were so many sublime

and in truth, his neat appearance, unstained skin, and free unshrink-
ing eye, very naturally suggested the idea that he could have no busi-
ness there.
Is Mr. Parsons within'' said Michael boldly, and daring the in-
quiry as much because he knew not what to say, as from any deliberate
resolution to do so.
 Yes,'' replied the man; `` he is about the place somewhere, I seed
him not more than ten minutes ago.''
Michael nodded his heal, and walked through the gate into tho
court, aeross which he had passed in trembling a thousand times.
Nor was he now quite free from a slight feeling of alarm at the idea of
meeting the sharp eyes of his former terrible taskmaster, and felt
much inclined to blame himself for the curious temerity which had
brought him so nearly within his gripe. But it was toolate to retreat,
for at the distance of a dozen yards he saw Parsons before him, coming
forth from the building into the court. On secing the stranger he im-
mediately approached him; Mlichael touched his hat.
 What may your business here be, young man?'' said Parsons eye-
ing him from top to toe.
tI called in, sir, to inquire whether you happened to want a spin-
ner, and what the wagcs may be,'' said Michael.
 Ie it for yourself?'' demanded Parsons, knitting his brows, and
looking at him with a sort of incredulous sneer.
 WVhy, no sir, it is for a kinsman who happens to be out of em-
ploy,'' replied Michael, colouring from the unusual consciousness of
deceit, and from the same catse casting his eyes upon the ground,
thereby displaying the remarkable length of his black eyelashes, and
giving to his whole countenance a look much more resembling that of
former days, than he had worn when he first entered.
Parsons looked at him with a sort of vague idea that he had seen
him before.
 WVhere do you come from'' said he.
 From WVestmorland, sir. I have been living in service there fot
these four years past.''
And pray what may your name be 2''
 Robert Thornton, sir,'' replied Miehael, blushing again, as he
thus unceremoniously borrowed the appellation of his worthy master.
HIave you eser worked in a factory yourself?''
 Yes, sir, 1 have, when I was a boy,'' said Michael, from mere
want of skill and hardihood in the art of lying.
tAnd you think you have betterel yourseli, I suppose, with your
fine buff waistcoat, and the rest of it. No we don't want no spinnere
here,''
MIichael by no means unwillingly obeyed this dismissal, and walked
away, more than half ashamcd of his achievement.
I 1 didn't know that Michael Armstroug was dead, I should swear
that there cbap was him,'' said a girl somewbat older than our
mprudent masquerader, and who had been watching him very earu-
estly during the foregoing conersation. The observation was not

addressed to the oerlooker, but to another girl, who had brought the
speaker her dinner to prevent her leaving some particular work on
which she was employed.
 WVhat's that you say, Sykes?'' said Parsons, turning quickly to-
wards her,
2I was saying, sir, as that boy was unaccountable like Mlichael
Armstrong, as used to live in mother's back-kitchen. He wasn't
above a year or two younger than me, and I knowed him as well as I
did my own brothers.''
``Stuf and nonsense, girl All the world knows that young rascal
ied years ago: and fuss enough there was nade about it hy that
mad miss at Milford, who I suppose, found out that she was their
cousin, or something of the sort, for she took it so to heart, that she
sold her house and lands, and ran away with another of 'em to some
foreign country, for fear he should die too. Sure you must mind all
that queer story ?'
 Yes, sir,'' replied the girl; `'I rememher it right well, and that's
the reason why I says that I know it can't be him.''
` Yet upon my soul, now you mention it, he was the very image of
him. I fancied as I looked at him that sure-ly 1I had seen him some-
wlere before. But it can't be-a dead dog is deal, all the world
over,''
 Yes sure, sir,'' responded Kitty Sykes, who being what is called a
very sightly gisl, was not unfrequently indulged with a little conde-
scending notice from Mr. Parsons.  ut 'twas his queer curly blaek
hair. and his particular-looking eyes as put it into my head.''
And if you go on talking of it, Sykes, in that way, you will be
putting it into my head too. And after all, there is nothing so very
impossible in it. Nobody in these parts could really know much
about it, you see, and there's no reason, as I can tell, why the scamp
might not have run away from the Deep - that is, the stoeking-
weaver's manufactory as he was sent 'printice to, and they as ought to
have stoprped him, might have given out that he was dead,'' replied
the overlooker.
`Then if it was possible,'' resumed Hitty Sykes,I wouldn't mind
takiog my bodily oath that that there young fellow was Michael Arm-
atrong, and nobady else,''
 Egal, I wish I hadn't let him go.'' cried Parsons, running to
the gates, ' He was 'printiced till twenty-one, and if he has run away,
he's liable to he taken up and put in pcison, by the first as catches
him,''
Kitty Sykes took the liberty of running to the gates also; but to say
he tuth, she hal no wish at all that Mr. Parsons should cateh him
up, and put him into prison. The girl, though she hal prudence
cnough not to communicate the opinion to her friend Mr. Parsons,
thought the stranger by far the handsomest young fellow she had
evrer seen, and secretly determined. if she could catch sight of him
again, that she would give him a hint to keep clear of his old acquaint-
anCE.

TRE LIF AND ADVENrDRES
 There he goes,'' cried Parsons, watching Michael, as with upright
gait, and rapid strides, he was pursuing his way by the well-remem-
borcd path, which lcl from the factory to Dowsling Lolge.  There
he goesl He don't look like one of the mill-people any way-and
yet thc fellow said that he had worked in a factory. Didn't you hear
him, Kiuy2
 Yes, sir,'' replied the girl, ` and it was just then as I felt so un-
accountable sure that, unless it was out and out impossible, it must be
Michael Armstrong as was speaking. I never did see such eyes a
Michael's, nor such hair neither,.''
``And there he goes, Ill et a sovereign,'' rejoined the overlooker, ``to
take a look at his old quarters at the Lolge. Kitty, I'll gise you a
glass of gin and a shilling, if you'll ran ater him-you can run like a
hare, I know-run and hring him back, IKitty, there's a darling, and
say as I have got some good news to tell him.''
Off started the girl with right good-will, havsing her awn reasons for
wishing to do the errand, as well as a very sufficient inclination te gain
the promised reward.
Mr., Parsons by no means over-rated her running powers: and had
she been less flcet, she would have failel in her object, for Mlichael
walked briskly, and without any inclination to remain longer in the
vicinity of the mill, though by no means conscious that he had been
recognised.
He hal just turmnel the corner of a hedge when the girl overtook
lim, so that their colloquy did not take place within sight of the over-
looker
Michael heard the fair Kitty's appronch, and turned to see who it
was that thus came galloping and panting after him.
 Do you want me, young woman?'' said he, civilly stopping for
her.
e Well then, you are no changelingI'' repliel the girl,. laing
her hand on his arm; '' you were always out-and-out, the civilest
boy in the mill''
A very bright suffusion dyed the clear brown of Michael's cheek as
he heard this,
 I do not know what you mean1'' he replied.
 Come, come, lichael Armstrong,'' rejoinel Kitty, `` you neein't
be afraid of me. Don't you rememler Iitty Sykes, as have gone t
and from the mill with yon and Teddy, a hundred and a hundrel
times ?''
Is it indceed Kitty ykes, grown into such a handsome young
woman 2'' snaid Michael, holding out lis hand to her, and feeling quite
incapable of preserving his incognito, in the presence of so old an ac-
aintance. ` And to think of your knowing me, Kitty1 But you
must not betray me, my dear girl. If I was found out for Mlichael
Armstrong, I might get into a scrape.''
`And that's true, and no lie,'' answered the faithless ambassadress,
` for I am sent after you bhy that old beast Parsons, to tell you to come
back, hccause hc had good news for you. But his nes would just

 Then what sort of names, my good Iad, do you suppose will sup-
port this petition. Do you think the gret mill-owners will sign it?
-Do you think such men as Sir Matthcw Dowling for instance, whom
you may have heard spoken of, dow at Ashleigh, maybe, do you think
it will be such as he, whose first bject in life is to get as many hours
of labour out of the little creatures that work for him, as stripcs can
make thcem give, do you think it will bc such as he, that will sign the
ten hours bill ''
Not if that bill is either to hurt himself, or better the children, I
should think,'' said Michael.
True enough,'' replied his new acquaintance, '` and not only is
that true, but he and the like of him will do all that mortal men can,
to preent all others fom signing it. But Heaven forbid tliey should
succeed, young man--for if they do, the best hope of many thousand
suffering, and most helpless human beings, will fall to the ground I''
 Then, indeed, may Heaen forhid that they shounld have their willI''
returned Michael, fervently.  When is this meeting to take place?''
he added, turning his eyes again to the papcrs he still held in his hand.
 But three days hencel--truly I should like to witness it ''
' Is thcre any reason against your doing it?'' demanded the stran-
ger.  Wll your services be wanted by your master hefore that
time2
 He won't expect me, till two or threc days after it,'' replied
MIichael; I have done all I wanted-at lcast I have stayed as long
as I wished at Ashleigh, and I don't see any great harm there would be
in witnessing the mceting.''
Do see it, my good lad I' said the stranger;  1 predict that it
will offer a spectacle such as never was witnessed hefore, and most
likely never will, or can be seen.,again. A multitule, probably amount-
ing to above a hundred thousand overworked operatives, will meet in
peace and good order, to petition tor legal relief from the oppression of
n systcm which has hrought them to a lower state of dcgradation and
misery than any to which human beings have ever been brought be-
fore,  Were those in whom these poor people have confidenee, less
deeply anxious to presere the public peace than they arce, a diferent
mode of redress might be sought for. But as it is, an honest man
may enture to advise such a respcctable young fcllow as you seem to be,
to stretch your good master's leave a little, in order to be present at
this great spectaele,''
A good deal more conversation followcd on the same theme, and
are Mlichael had ceased to listen to his companion, he felt convinced
that duty as well as inclination would lead him to do all that a loyal
subject and peaceable citizen could, in aid of the suflering class from
whose ranks he had so miraculously escaped. In a word, Mlichael
Armstrongg determined to attend the great Yorkshire meeting, and hold
up his hand for the ten hours bill.

feeling.  :I fell intothe hands of the best man and the best master
that ever a wretched runaway hit upon.''
 I almost wonder at you then venturing to come within sight of
your own place again. You can't be one-and-twenty yet by your
looks, and you would not over-well like to work out your time in a
factory, I should think,'' said the other.
I don't think l should,'' replied Michael, laughing; ``and I have
run some risk, I promise you, already, of thevery thing you talk of, since
I left my master's house. Nothing would content my foolish fancy for
calling back old times, but going to look at the very factory where 1
first worked, and talking to the identical tyrant who tortured me
there.''
`But he did not know you, I hope?'' said the old man.
I can hardly say thathe did not,'' replied Mlichael;  for some na-
tion or other came into his head, and after I left him he sent for me
to come back again. It was, however, by a friendly messenger who
knew well enough who I was, and gave me pretty plainly to understand
which way I had better walk-and that was good luck again. But I
was sorry, too, to hae to turn away from the old place without learn-
ing any news of my former acquaintance. I found the samc over-
looker at Sir Matthew Dowling's mill, and that was all I could find
out.'
S Mathew Dowling's mill at Ashleigh? that's my country,
too. My wife keeps a school at Mlilford,'' replied the man, `` and we
have heard enough of Sir Matthew.''
eCan you tell me any thing about his daughter Martha2'' de-
mantded Mlichael, with the appearance of being greatly interested in
the inquiry.  She was very kind to me, atd I loved her next best,
I think, to my own dear mother and brother. Do you happen to
know any thing about her ?''
 Not just at present,'' replied the man; `` though they do say,
that all the family are likely to havse a downfal, owing to Sir Iat-
thew's getting into a scrape about bad bills, or somethingor other,
t'other side of the water. ButI do well remember something particular
about Mliss Martha that you talk of, a matter of seven years ago; and
if she was good to you, it was more than she was to every body. for it
was all along of a cruel piece of treachery of hers, that I lost the best
mistress that ever man had. I dare say, if you come from Ashleigh,
you must know the name of iss Brotherton, though it's long since
she left MIilford. I was her coachman, and if it had not been for
Miss Martha Dowling, I believe I might have been so still,'
I was but just turned ten years old, at the time I knew MIiss
Martha,'' returued Michael;  but I shouldn't have thlought she could
be treacherousto any body.''
She was though, for all our people knew thewhole story from
first to last, and a queer story it was too, when one thinks of the end
of it; which was neither more nor less than sending our dear young
lady away out of the couutry.''
 Inever happened to know any thing about the lady who owned the

you at a pinch, if you should happen to have needof me. And here,
Michael Armstsong, are thee sovereigns, that I give you to keep for
two reasons. One is, that you may use them in case you have need,
The other, that il you don't want them, I slall be sure to see you,
when you bring them back, and that you will lo, or IIl never trust a
las Ice mose: ad e good bye. I is but a wildish sort of boys
trick though, setting off this way at night, when you ought to be in
bed,'
 The air and the walk will do me more good than all the beds in
the world:'' repliel Michael.  God bless you, sir. Sce me yo
shall, if I continue to live;'' and so saying, he strode forth into the
night, with a longing for greater space to breathe in, than could be
found in the kitchen of the Royal-oak.
The boy was right as to the effect which this bolily exertion would
produce upon him. The very darkness calmed him; he took his hnt
off that the cool air might batle his temples with its dewy breath;
and though his pace was rapid, and scarcely relaxed for a noment
during many miles, the action of his pulse became more healthy, and
the aching of his throbbing temples passed away-
All he now seemed to fear was that his imagination shonld cheat
him into the persuasion that all he wished was true. Edward l
Fanny 1 (for of her identity with Mliss Brotherton's protge he could
hardly doubt, when he remembered the history of her departure from
the beep Valley)-these names seemed to iing in his ears, and to be
insceribed in starlight on the heavens as he raised his eyes towards
them. And thus the sixteen miles were traversed before he had half
chewed the cnd of all the sweet thoughts that thronged upon his
fancy. When he reached Fairly, it was still much tos early to find
any one stirring, so Michael unceremoniously walked into a cart-
shed, and clamhering up into a vehicle that had the sweet savour of
newly-carried hay to recommend it, he placed his bundle under his
head, and despite both hopes and fears, fell into a sound sleep, nor
waked till cocks, hens, cews, p'gs, and ploughboys, all joined in
chorus to arouse him.

tain-braced Westmorland shepherd, lay extended on a. sofa, with
essenees at his nese. and the opening of his dark eyes watched for, as
tenderly as if he had been a delicate yonng laly.
A deep-drawn sigh announced to Mr. Bell, who stood by, anxiously
watching him, that his remedies had been successful, that the boy so
long mourned as dead, was really and truly alive, and a very hand-
some, well-grown fellow into the bargain.
 This is a strange history, Michael, as evrer I chanced to hear,''
said he, taking the boy's hand, and ascertaining that his pulse again
made ` healthial musice.' ee WVhy we have all been mourning for you
as dead for this many a year, and now you drop down, as if from the
clouds, and by what l can make out, have been fancying on your
side that Edward was dead too. The first thing to do, must, I think,
be to give you some breakfast, and then, if you are strong enough,
you shall tcll me how all this has come to pass,''
Full as his heart was, and eagerly as he longed for the conversation
in which he had so mnuch to learn, as well as to tell, MIichael grate-
fully submitted to this arrangement, till having received from the
hands of the deeply-interested Mrs, Bell herself the refceshmnent he
so greatly necded, he felt his young strength retur, and if he
trembled as he turned his eyes towards his kind host, with a look that
seemed to say,  Now, sir, I can talk to you,'' it was from eager-
ness, not weakness.
MIr. Bell understood the appeal, and well inclined to answer it, said,
Having told you that Edward is alive and well, my dear boy, and
only wants the sight that I see now to make him perfectly happy, I
think you ought to be satisfied, and not expect me to tell yo any
more till mys curiosity is gratified by hearing your own history. How
in theworld did it happen, Michael, that when Miss Brotherton went
to the Deep Valley Mills, on purpose to look for you, she should come
back persuaded that you were dead, though the charming little girl
she brought away with her had seen you there, and seemed to know
you well2'
Michael Armstrong told his own story more succinctly than I have
been able to do it, and probably much better too; for he heguiled Mrs.
I3ell of many tears as she listened to him; and bare as the sad narra-
tive was of events, her husband also hung pon every word of it, as
if, contrary to the theory which seemed to be pretty generally esta-
lished in his neighbourhood, he thought the feelings and the suffer-
ings of a faetory-child might be capable of exciting interest.
When the history had reached its conclusion, and Michael had
fairly brought himself into Mr. Bell's breakfast-parlour, he paused,
and with a very eloquent look of entreaty said,  Now, sir, may I not
listen to you?'
Yes, my dear boy,'' replied his new friend, in the happy tono with
which a kind heart inspires words calculated to give pleasure.  Yes,
you hase much to hear, and a wonderful story it is, I promise yo.
But it shall be all true Michael, so don't faney that I am telling yon a
fairy tale, and that Miss Drotherton is the fairy. lBut first tell me, be-

fore I go any further, what sort of a boy was your brother Edward
when you saw him last ?''
Oh, sir1 he was the dearest, kindest fellow that ever lived 1'' re-
plied Michael, his firie eyes beaming with tenderness and well-remem-
bered love.
 But what sort of a boy was he to look at?'' demanded the
clergyman.
Michael closed his eyes as if the better to contemplate the inward
picture engraven on his memory.
e His face was a sweet face,'' said he, ' but his dear limbs were
crippled. HIe was a slighter boy than me, and could not' stand the
labour of the mill; and I fear-I fear,'' hc added, shuddering, ` that
my poor Edward must live and die a cripple.''
What is your opinion about that, my dear?'' said Mr. Bell, tumn-
;;;aveeeeem-
culty in identifying his brother when he gets to him,'' she replied.
Instead of being a cripple,'' resumed MIr, Bell,  I suspcct that
your brother is a handsomer fellow than you are, Mliclael. Every
thing promised well for it when he tookc leave of us, and since then
my wife has had letters from Miss Brotherton, which do not speak of
any falling off in his improvement.'
 Nay,'' said the lady,I hae had more than letters to speak fo
it. Shall I show him Mliss Brotherton's drawing, George ?'
 MIost certainly, my dear; it will save me a vast deal of descrip-
tion, and you may trust to Miss Brotherton's pencil, Miichael, as im-
plicitly as to my words, for there never was a more faithful limncr,''
Mlrs. Bell thea opened a little portfolio, secured by a key, and drew
thence a drawing iu water-colours, the composition and finish of which
would have done no discredit to a professional artist. How the stout
nerves of the young and athletic Michael trembled as he received itl
At first his eyes seemed to fail him, the outline, the colouring, the
whole group was indistinct. I am a fool, sirI'' he said, lettiag the
hand that held it drop beside him:`' I positively cannot see.''
1 don't much wsonder at it,'' replied Mlr. Bell; `` but try again,
MIichael, it is worth looking at.''
And so thought Mlichael, as he once more placed it befare him, and
gazed upon it with an eye as eager as that of Surrey might have been,
hen contemplating the magic mirror that was to show him what he
loved ` in life and limb,'' The drawing represented a terrace-walk,
along which ran a handsome stone balustrade partially coered by
vine-lenves; while beneath it in the distance, stretched to a fuar hori-
zon a glorious river, careering through a rich and varied landscape.
All this wsas fair to look npon, but the boy's eyes saw it not-they
were riveted upon two figures that occupied the foreground of the
terrace. Onc of these was a slender girl, whose bright curls seemed
just released from the restraint of a straw-hat which she held in her
and. IBut though the hcal was thus uncovered, the featares were

ot visible, for the other hand was placel upon the balustrale, over
which she hung, as if in earnest contemplation of some object bhelow.
But the head of the other figure, a young man of some twenty years
or so, was so tumed as fully to meet the spcctator's eye: and if the
pencil that drew it flattered not, it was onc of the handsomest that
nature ever formed. The large expressive eyes, beaming with mingled
softness and animation, were directed to some object out of the pic-
wure, but at no grcat distancc; for thc sweet smile that played about
the mouth secemed to indicate that he was listening to pleasant words
from some well-loved companion. The figure of the young man thus
represented, was tall and graceful. His dress was the light summcr
garb of a southern climate-an open hook was in his hand, his straw
hat lay at his feet, beside which stood a basket of newly-gathered
gePes, and a small Italian greyhound, its bright eye looking in the
same direction as his own, completed the group, which spokc in cvery
part of it a sort of graceful ease and cnjoyment, that it was very plea-
sant to look upon.
Cn this indeed e my Edward2'' said Michael at length, fter a
Ilong silent examination of the drawing. `How heautifal -how
noble l-how happy-hw healthful-how intelligent he looks? Is it
my own dear, pale, sickly brother? Can this be true2''
`As truc as that you stand there to look at it,'' replied Mr. Bell,
 Is there nothing in the face, Michael, that recalls your brother ta
you?'
'es, sir,'' he replied quiekly;  the eyes and the sweet smile are
so like my own Edwiard, ithat strange as it is to see him so healthy,
tall, anl graceful as he is represented here, and looking, too, so greatly
like a gcntleman, I do quite bclieve that this was never drawn for any
one but him; for never, never since I saw him last, have lI seen such
eyes, or such a smile as that.''
 Yon are quite right there, Michael. The face is one not ensily
forgotten, and I can trace i here, notwithstanding all the change of aga
and circumstance. But who do you think that slender girl may bel
t seems a pity not to see he face; the form, the pretty attitude, the
bright wavring locks, all plainly tell that it must be worth looking at.
Can you guess who it is ?''
`Isuppose it is Fanny Fletcher,'' replicl Michael, colouring
` And there, too, you are quite right. But does it not puzzle you
to think how all this las been brought about? How does it happen,
think you, that those whom you remembcr in a statc so different,
should now be liing as you se them here, looking as if their exist-
ence were made up of sunshine and sweet air ?''
And now again I shall answer, as they say the fortune-tellers do,''
zeplied Michael, smiling, ' by telling you, sir, what you have before
told me. It is Miss rotherton, whose name I well remember at
Dowling Lodge, it is she whao has done all this, and may God bless hen
for itt  But yct, truly, it still seems a mystery. How did it hape

my having advanced in the precious labour of making these two be-
loved beings happier. Were they merely ordinary yeung people, with
average hearts and average capacities, I should still bless Ileaven with
a gateful heart, for having permitted me to be the menns of changing
their condition, from one of great suffering to a life of innocent enjoy-
ment. But as it is, 1 know not how to be thankful enoughl
It seems to me, dear iriends, however much I increase my ac-
quaintance with other human beings, that Edward and Fanny are
the noblest creatures in the world. Is it that suffering, being of ne-
cessity a part of our earthly nature, we cannot arrive at the perfect
development of all our faculties without it 2 Where it arrives in later
life, perhaps, the effect, though inwardly healthful, may not shom
fruits so beautiful. Thore is in the minds of both of them, a bright-
ness of intelligence, and a delicious calm of temper that I have never
met clsewhere. It is as if a heavy weight that had been painfully
crushing them, was suddenly removed, causing all the ordinary sen-
sations of human existence to be felt as a luxury. oung as they
are, they are full of instruction, right thinking, pure feeling, and
a firmness of integrity which it is the best joy of my life to contem-
plate-and all this built on so firm a foundation of religious prineiple,
that I can have no fears for its cndurance. After this, it would be
very weak and womanish folly to dwell much on their personal advan-
tages, or even on the peculiar charm of their manners and conversa-
tion-yet they are gifts which bring a charm, to which itis difficul to
be quite insensible.
`Is it not strange, dear friends, that being such as I describe them,
and having passcd so lrge a portion of their lives together in the mu-
tual contemplation of each other's excellence, is it not strange that
they should not by this time be lovers, insteal of frienls ? Yetsuch is not
the case. That thcy love each other sincerely is most true, and I could
give a thousand proofs thnt either would at all times gladly renounce
usement or pleasure of any kind, for the sake of the other; but
they are not in love. If I did not believe it impossible, considering
the age of the parties when they parted, I should think that Fanny's
little heart had been buried in the grave of MIichael, the poor little
fellow, whose early sufferings under the tender patronage of Sir Mat-.
thew Dowling, first rouscd my sleepy existence into action. She can-
not yet hear his name mentioned, without betraying a degree af emo-
tion that it is painful to witness; and when, as sometimcs happens,
Edward is taken for her brother, it seems to delight hcr.  Yes, yes.

he will tell you that I am to him a dear and loving sister,' I havo
heanl er say, and if Eward had beeu asked, I do believe he would
have answered, and truly too, in thc same strain.
 Edward is now twenty-one, and my pretty Fanny nineteen: but,
notwithstanding the variety of captivating young people with whom
they are perpetually associating, I cannot believe that the heart of
either has as yet rcceived any .tender impression-though in more

nance, and his hand trembled as he stretched it forth to receive that
which was kindly extended towards him.
 You have remained too long alone. my dear boy, in this cold
nock,'' said MIr. Bell, taking the young man's arm within his own,
and Ieading him towards the house. : What makes you look so pale,
Michael? ou are not ill, I ope?''
 No, sir, I think not,'' was the reply. ` but I can hardly tell yo
how I fcel. At one moment the idea that my leatr brother still lives,
and that it is possible lI may again see him, hear him, hold him in my
arms, seems to make me taoo hapy to breathe-and then again, a
sort of doubt and sadness takes hold upon me, and lI do not feel as
if it were possible I conld ever make one in the happy party on the
terrace.''
And why not, Michaol?'' demanded Mr. Bell somewhat reproach-
fully; ``after reading that letter, can you find it in your heart to doubt
that the party on the terrace would receive you joyfully 2'
 IiI1 not the happiness be too great'' cried Michael.  Oh1 how
can l deserve itt''
Not by doubting the goodness or the affection of those who love
you,'' replied Mr. Bell. `But come, I must not preach to you now,
I bhelieve, for I suspect that you are not in a condition to profit by it.
Come into the house, sit down, and grow reasonable as fast as you
ean, and then we will talk of the time and the mode in which you
must set off to join ybour family-for your family they are, and will
be, Michael, yon may depend upon it,''
Can I throw myself upon Miss Brotherton, sir, without her per-
mission ?'' lemanded Michael, while his paleess was changed for a
moment into a glow of the deepest red.
I am afrail you hae a very proud heart, Michael,'' said Mr. Bell,
looking at him: ` and that is net right, it is not chistianlike.''
Oh, Mr. Bell1'' replied Michael, with strong feeling, `` have I not
already eaten the bitter bread of denendence, and can I, at my age,
and with my power to labour, submit to it again ''
 You have a notion then, yng man, that benefits conferred by
a Sir Matthew Dowling, and a Mliss Brotherton, are the same thing ?''
said MIr. Bell.
Not so, sir,'' replied Michael,  I cannot doubt that she who
wrate this letter, must be both great and good, and I well know that
Sir Matthew Dowling was neither. But I only know Miss Brotherton
as one of the fine folks visiting at his house, and I cannot feel that
lI should like to start out suddenly upon her. from the tomb, as it
would seem, appearing to expect that she should adopt me too, as she
has done my brother Edward.''
 Vell, Michael, I must not blame you for this, because I believe
it is very natural; yet, nevertheless, I feel quite sure that you will
forget all such notions when you see Miss Brotherton,'' returned
Mr. Bell, smiling. Michael shook his head, but he returnel the
smile, though rather languidly; and when they hal reached the house,

and were again seated in the study, he said, : hat does Miss
Brotherton mean, sir, by calling Miss Martha Dowling ` poor lartha.'
I trust that no misfortune has efallen her? shc was very kind to me,
and I shall always love her, although her name is Dowling.''
1 elieve she deserves it, hMichael,'' retumned Mr. Bell, ``and,
by the by, you have it in your power to show your love, and do her
a great kindness by thc very simple process of letting her know that
you are alive. Poor girl: She has suffered dreadfully from believing
that she caused your death by the advice she gave to your mothet
about signing your indentures, and I fncy that lctting her know that
you did not perish in consequencc, would be conferring a real blcssing
on her,''
Dear, good Miss Martha:'' exclaimed Michael, ` how well do 1
remembcr the walk we took together when she went to Hoxley-lane,
to give my dearest mother that advice. She lid it for my good, and
for my good it would have been, if what she advised had been the
thing she thought it I owe her still, notwithstanding the misery she
brought me to, the deepest gratitude; for her kind and careful tcacling
during the short time l1 was in her father's house first gave me the
ambition and the hope to learn, and, spite of my degraded condition,
I have ever lost sight of it-and this it is, which, if any thing can,
may reconcile me to presenting myself as a poor shepherd-boy before
my well-taught brother.'
You are right there, MIichael,'' replied Mr. Bell; " it is very clear
to me that you have profited greatly by the feelings so inspired., not-
withstanding the adverse circumstances in which you were placed
during the four terrible years passed in the Deep Valley; and such
feelings I can tell you, will make a vast difference in the degree of
happiness you are likely to enjoy in a reunion with your brother.''
 And to Fanny Fletcher tool'' said Michael, with the cagerness of
resiving hope heightening his colour, and darting its brightness from
his eye,-'`to anny Fletcher too, I owe the suggestion of thoughts
which have saved me from being too utterly degraded to mect her
again with pleasure. It is to Mlartha Dowling., surely, tbat I owe all
the little book lcnrning I have becn ablc to acquire, as well as the
power of writing down the thoughts and meditations to which it has
give rise; but it was Fanny who madc me fcel that however lowly
our condition and state on earth, we may yet retain as good a right
as any of the kings of it, to open our hearts before God, and ask for
His Spirit to holp us. IIow many mornings have I watchcd the sun

mountain-tops, arid thought as lI lay amidst the heather, and wor-
shipped his AImighty Mfaker, that, but tfor hcr, I should neser have

It was that dear patient little girl who taught me this, and perbaps I
may yct live to thank her for it.''

she showsed you is, indeed,

and I doubt not that she, as well as yourself, has been the better for
it, from that time to this.''
MIa I look once more at that urawing, sir?'' said Michael, with
some little embarrassment.
 There it is, Michael,'' said the clergyman smiling, and once more
laing it hefore him.  WYere it not that I think yon will so soon see
the dear originals, and that we shall not, I would ask my wife to give
it you.''
I think I shall learn every line, and every shale of it by rote,''
said Michael, if I do but look at it a few minutes longer. There,

seemed to rouse himself; and, as if endeavouring to shake off some
feeling that oppressed lim, he said, ` But you have not told me yet,
sir, the reason why MIiss Brotherton calls my first benefactress ` poor
Marthai' 
I am sorry to say,'' replied MIr. Bell, ` that there are more reasons
than one, for applying that pityiag epithet to Mliss Martha Dowling.
In the first plaee she is greatly out of health, poor gil: and in the
next, her father's affais are said to be in a very tottering condition, in
consequence of his having overloaded himself with a greater quantity of
spun cotton than he can get any sale for. He is said to have lent out
money, too, on some speculation which has not answered: and, in short,
that it is rather a nice question, whether he will be able to get through
his difficukties or not. Another misfortune is, that Sir Matthew, as
soon as he possibly coull afer the death of his first wife, thought proper
to marry the ady Clarissa Shrimpton wlo, strange to say, thought
proper also to marsy him: and it is said also, that poor Miss Martha,
who is the eldest of the daughters unmarried, is not permitted to enjoy
much peace under the rule of her noble step-mother,''
Lady Clarissa Shrimpton?'' said Mlichael, with the air of one to
whom some long-lost image is brought back-`` ILady Clarissa Shrimp-
ton 2 Why, surely, that was the name of the tall, thin woman who
had to practise the laying her bony hand upon my unfortunate little
head, when the terrible play was about:''
I dare say it was,'' said MIr. Bell,  But, at any rate, Laly
Clarissa fihrimplon is now Lady Clarissa Dowling.''
Poor Miss Martha I-and she is out of health too? How can 1
manage te pay my duty to her, Mlr. Bell, without running the risk of
being recognised by Sir Matthew, as the unfortunate boy who escaped
fromn the bDeep Valley? He would be able, I suppose, to make me
serve out ty time?''
I do not think he ould attempt it just now, Mlichael ?'' was the
consolatory reply. s Thank God ?I'' continued Mr. Bell, `` there has
been a good deal said of late concerning the abominations of the
334

Deep Valley Factory, and I don't much think Sir Matthew Dowling
would run the risk of having it proved that he had kidnapped a boy
away o it, in the style he managed you. I should have no fear
whatever, of your presenting yourself at Dowling Lodge: only I
think it is ten to one her ladyship will not let you get a sight of Miss
Martha without her being present,-unless you were to write a line to
the young lady first, and then perhaps she might contrive it.''
Michael now rose to take his leave, offering with a fervour that was
very touching, his earnest thanks for the generous kindness with
which he had been received ; but he resisted all the hospitable efforts
made to retain him as a guest. He had need, he said, to be alone,
that he might bring his mind to such a state as should enable him to
sustain the wonderful change in his prospects with something like
fortitude and rational composure. There was more real kindness, and
true sympathy, in the manner of accepting this excuse, than the
most pressing offers of hospitality could have shown: and hMlichael,
after involuntarily kissing the hand stretched out to bid him farewell
took his departure from the clergyman's honse, with a heart full of
thankfulness to God and man.

ITH A CHANGED PACE.
To descrlbe Michael Arstrong's feeling as he took his solitary way
along what seemed to him the most unfrequented fields he could find,
would be both a difficult and an unnecessary task. That his heart
swelled with thankfulness and joy cannot be doubted; yet thcrc was a
vagueness and uncertainty as to what he ought immediately to do,
which made him anxious and sad, even in the midst of hope and joy.
The small sum he had been able to save from his wagcs had been
spent, or very nearly so, sincc he set out upon his eventful cxpedition.
He had already accepted a loan from the friendly old coachman of
Miss Brotherton, and he shrunk from the ilea of contracting more
debts, while unable to say with certainty when they should be paid.
How then was he to reach his brother in his happy distant home
And where and how was he to pass the anxious interval that must of
necssity intervene before he could even know to what point he should
direct his pilgrim steps, even had he the mcans of setting forth2
The path he hd taken proved to be a shore cut leading into the high-
road from Fairly to Ashleigh, and on quitting the fields he found
himself close to the door of a public-house which he was tempted to
select for his shelter as long as he remained in the neighbourhood,
both because it was lonely, and hecause it was humble. Having en-
tered there, bespokeu a bed, and male a very frugal repast, he

inquired the distance to Dowling Lodge, and finding it was greater
than he could traverse on foot with any hope of returning in decent
time to occupy his newly-taken lodging, he resolved to wait till the
following orning, when, by setting off at dnaybreak, he might be able
to make his visit to Martha, and perhaps report the result of it to
MIr. Bell, before he slept.
His mind had too much on which to employ itself for him to feel
the afternoon a long one: an orchard close behind the little inn,
afforded him shade and soft turf whereon to sit or lie, or to paee back-
wards and forwards, with uneqtal steps, as he meditatedt on the
chances for anl against his ever being one in the happy, thrice happy
party described by Mliss Brotherton. Nor had he wearied of these
exciting, but most anxious thoughts, when the moon, and the stars,
and the heavy dew warned him at length that the day was gone, and
night come. And then he remembered that, in order to follow Mr.,
Bell's adviee, he must prepare himself with a letter to Miss Martha,
which it would be neeessary to write before he went to bed. Fortu-
nately his hotel was able to furnish the needful implements, and aften
a little refleetion, he pennedl the following note:
A poor lad, to whom Miss Martha Dowling once showed mnch
charitable kindness, is now waiting at the park-gates, to know if he
may pay his duty to her. He takes the freelom of asking for this
favour, because he has been told that she would be pleased to hear
he was alive and well.'' Having directed this to Miss Martha Dow-
ling, and sealed it in the best manner he could, he retired to his little
bed in a stnte of mind that hovered between inexpressible felicity, and
anxiety that he was hardly able to bear.
He was afoot in time to hear the lark's first overture on the following
moruing; and his spirits, cheered by the bracing intiuence of the
delicious hour, and by the sound sleep which had preceded it, en-
abled him to breakfas on a slice of brown bread, bespoken the night
before, and laid realy for him, with a draught of icy-cold water from
a neighbouring wvell, wvithout any mixture of melancholy, though he
thought the while of all the dangers and difficulties he might have ta
encounter ere he stod beside his Edward on the beautiful terrace
to which his lreams had transported him so easily.
Michael wuas a stout walker, and had reached the well-remembered
precincts of Dowling Lodge soon after the earliest servants were
stirring. Ile huad made up his mind to be the bearer of his own
letter, and accordingly, having shown the address to the woman at
the lodge as a reason for being permitted to enter, he approched the
stately mansion by the road which led to the oftices, and intrusting
his epistle to the first female he encountered, requested her to deliver
it to Miss MIartha without delay.
WVhy she hean't up yet,'' said the girl, looking at him, however,
with tle good-humoured smile with which light-hearted young dam-
sels are wont to greet such very handsome iads as our Nichael.
 But perhaps you will be so good as to let her have it as soon
as she is awake ?'' he replied, returning the smile.
Well, poor thing, and that may be naw, most likely,'' returned
s36

turned the girl, ` faor her cough often wakes her hefore this time-
WiIl you wait for an answer ?''
 I won't trouble the servants by staying here,'' renlied Mlichael:
 but if you please ye may tell the young laly that Iill walk 
and down the road iill she can let me have it. Does Miss Martha
walk out early in the mornings, as she used to do?'' he added.
eThat's just what she likes best, poor thing,'' replied the girl.  But
you neeln't he afeard that she's gone out alresdy; for if she had, l
should have been sure to have seed her; for she never has the great
door opened for her at this time df day, for fear of disturbing my
lady, who always lies unaccountable late.''
'' Anl does Sir Matthew rise early now ?'' demanded Michael with
some anxiety.
He:-not he: He eats and sleeps like a pig. they say: but he
is grumpier than ever he was, both to men and maids too, since he
married the new lady. I wonder as I never happened to see you
before, as you seem to know 'em all so well,''
 It is several years since I was last here,'' returned Michael; ` but
run up stairs with it, there's a dear girl, will you l because I want to
get my answer and be off,''
You had better stop here till I come down again,'' replied his
good-natured messenger, `` instead of walking up and down the rond,
without knawing whether there's an answer or no-sit down in the
kitchen, and I'll he back in no time.''
And into the kitchen he went-the selfsame kitchen which just
eight years before had been the scene of his painful examination by
Sir Matthew bDowling's servants. He remembered the room perfectly;
could have pointed out the exact spot where the awful housekeeper
eat, and the place where he had himself stood, with no better champion
to sustain his courage than the greasy kitchen-maid, whose pitying
broad face, bent oer him, he reeollected as perfectly as if it had
beamed upon him but the day before. He was still deeply revolving
these interesting reminiscences, and the strange contrast they offered
to his pnresent hopes, when his envoy returned- MIiss Martha wsants
to know your name, yosg man,'' she said, ` but she is getting up,
and will be walking in the park as usual, she says, presently, so it is
likely enough that she will give you the answer herself,''
 Very well,'' replied MIichael, perfectly satisfied-'`good morning
--I am very much obliged to you.''
But you haven't told me your name, anl MIiss Martha says that
she should like to know it,''
 MIy name isn't one that ould make any liference,'' he replied,
"so I wont trouble you to go up again about that-gool byel'' And
without waiting for any further discussion, he walked off, exceedingly
well pleased at having arranged the wished for tte-i-ttte so satisfac-
torily. The noble dimensions of the park enabled MIichael to select
a space amply sufficient for his promenade which was neither within
sight of the mansion nor the lodge, and ere he had made many turns
pen it, he perceived the lady he wished to see, approaching him.
He could not doubt that it was Martha, for at that hour of the

moruing none other was at all likely to be there; but she was too
much altered for him to recognise her inany degree. He thought she
was taller than he had expected to see her, but at any rate she was
greatly thinuer, and so dclicately pale, that her appearance was rather
a contrast, than a resemblance to what he had expected to meet. She
was already near him when he turned upon the path, and met her.
He stopped, took off his hat, and bowed respectfully.
You are Miss Martha Dowling, ma'am 7'' he said interrogatively.
 Yes,'' replied Martha, '` that is my name, but when did I sce
you before, young man? I do not know you,''
It is a great many years, Mliss Martha-but I can neer forget
your kindness.''
The pale cheek of Martha was tinted with a vivid blush, as she ex-
claimed, ` 1If it were possible-if I did not know that he was dead-
But this is nonsense,'' she added, recvering her composure. I
quite forget your person, young man,'' she continued, after a pause:
` But if l have ever done you any service, I am glad of it. Perhaps
if you tell me your name I may remember the circumstances to which
you allude.''
OI Miss Marthat'' replied Michael, :I am afrid my name
will startle you, anl therefore 1 do not like to speak it. But I think
it came into your head just now, only you stopped short, and said it
was impossible,''
Can it be Michael Armstrong that I see ?'' demanded Martha, in
an agitated voice.
It is indeed, Miss Martha'' he replied, ' It is Michnel Arm-
strong, come back to thank you for all your great kindness to him.''
My kindness to Michael Armstrong ?'' she exclaimed.-' AlasI
it wvas I who occasioned all his sufferings, and, as I have thought for
many years, his death. How is it you hae been saed, Michael ?
How is it you have escaped from the horrid place to whichlI was the
cause of your being sent ?''
 My dear Miss Marthai'' returned Michael, greatly affected by her
look of ill-health, and by the agitation she displayed-for tears were
trickling fast down her pale cheeks. e My dcar Miss Martha,'' he
said,  I know, if nobody else loes, the kind motive that you hnl for
every vord you spoke-and was it not I myself that said I wanted to
go, Miss Martha, when we walked together from here, down to poor
mother's house? Never, never can I thank you enough for all your
goodness then, as well as at all other times, from the very first mo-
ment that ever lI saw you 2

and raising her eyes to heaven,`` you know not, Mlichael, whata lond

for it. I was always stronger than Edard, you know, Miss MIartha,
and there is no reason because he livcs an idlc liie, tear fellow, that I
should do so too.''
 Michael ?'' she replied, her whole countenance lighted up with
the most animated expression of pleasure, `' my dear Michael Arm-
strong your coming here is certainly the greatecst blessing that
Heaven could have sent me. I cannot tell you, and you can ncver
know, all I have suffered from believing you were dead, and from
nowing that l had been the cause of great and terrible suffering to
you. And that, too, wholly owing to the trust which you, and your
poor mother reposed in mel May you never, my dear boy, know
what it is to have a conscience burdened as mine has been. Be very
sure that it is worse thtn any thing you could have suffcred at the
Deep Valley, Michaell When you see Mary Brotherton, tell her that
I owned this to you-and perhaps she may think, at last, that she
judged me rather more harshly than lI deserved,'
`If shce judged you harshly at all, she was rery wrong,'' replied
Michael, warmly.  People should know, before theyjudge. No-
boly who really knew you, could judge you harshly,''
 I had rathar that kind sentence came from your lips, Michael, than
from thase of any other human bciug. If ou can say it, and mean
it too, as I am sure you do, who is there iiving that can have a right
to say the contrary? et this is not my only pleasure-i happen to
have the powenr-and I bless my poor father for it-of making soine
little atonement for tho years of suffering that I so unwittingly cansed
you. From the day we were each of us fifteen, we have receivel an
allowance of sixty pounds a year for dress, and though I really never
wanted one-half so much as my sisters, my father, who has ever been
a kind father to me has always insisted upon my having the same, and
at the marriage of my two elder sisters, he gave me a hundred pounds
each time, that I might be smart. But I hae no taste for finery,
Michael, it always made me melancholy; so I am very rich-I really.
do not know how rich, for I havc aiways kept on laying the bank-
notes that I did not want in a drawer, and I have never counted them.
Think if it will not be a pleasure for me now to open that drawer, and
give you all tlat is in it? Oh1 with what differcnt feelings shalll ga
to bed to-night from any I have felt for years past1 I am sure there
must be enough to take you to Italy, or wherever else Miss Brotherton
may be gone, and to set you up in some little business into the bargain.
Wait here only ten minutes, my denar Mlichael, and I will return with
my treasure-a real trcasure now, and for the first time that I ever
thoght it so1'
Martha had risen from her seat as she spoke, and literally beforc
Michael could recover from his atonishment sufficiently to answcr her,
she was already at some distance from him. He had bhy no means
settled to his satisfuaction the question of whether he ought, or ought
not, to strip the generous Mlartha of her little hoard when she again
appeared, But she looked hurried and out olf breath.

WYith these words she turned from him, and with a step too rapid for
her state of health, and plainly showing her extreme anxiety, she
hastily retreated towards ithe house.
Though after hearing Mr. Bell's decided opinion that no further
danger was to be fered from Sir Mlatthew Dowling, Michael would
himself hnave felt not the least desire to run away trom him, yet it
was impossible not to perceive that Miartha was of a different mind,
and that for some reason or other she was exceedingly anxious
thut he should not remain near Dowling Lodge, or, in other words,
within her father's reach. Whether she were right, orsrong, in
fancying that it was necessary for his safety that he should keep out
of the way, he felt that it wvould be cruel to oppose her: and with the
unexamined roll of bank-notes thrust into his cot-pocket, he gae
but one farewell look at the retreating drapery of poor MIartha, and
then with rapid strides, and thoughts so full of the scene wlich had
just passed, that he followed the right path rather mechanically than
from judgment, he set off' upon his return to the humble lodging he
had secured for the night.

Tas morning's walk had been a long one, even for Michael Arm-

san ded kitchen of his little inn, with a loaf and cheese before him, of
sufficient dimensions to resist any attacks he could make upon them.
A moderate proportion of beer, in addition to the solid meal these
afforled, refreshed him so eflectually that he determined to take his
leave of MIr. Bell that night, preparatory to setting off on his return
to Westmorland on the following morning, in order to bid farewell
to his good old master there. On the subject of Martha's bank-notes
he meant to be entirely guided by the advice of the clergyman, being
equally fearful of oflending, or rather of paining their generous
owner by refusing to accept them, or of depriving her of what might
be hereaflter useful, by agreeing to do so.

M, Bcll's parlour, and both look and accent showed that the inter-
view hal been an interesting one. ``But, alas1 she is greatly al-

eyes.'' I fear she is very ill ;-but she was glad-oh so glad to see

his pocket.  Here is a large sum of money, I believe. She did
ot rightly know how much it was herself, she told me, beeause
she had kcpt on puttiug by what she did not want, and had neier
counted how much it came to-and I'm sure lI have not counted it
either; but whether it is little or much, I don't feel quite certain
whether I ought to take it.''
Mr. Bell smilcd at the unusual manner in which the rich-looking,
but carelessly-packed roll of paper had passed from one hand to the
other. Before he examined the contents he questioned Michael as to
all that the generous-henrted girl had said to him, on bestowiag it,
and the young man's faithful answers soon convinced him that there
would be litle kinness to thce self-rcproaching Martha in refusiga
onation which she evidently cansidered as an utonement, and which
would, he doubted not, by its application to Michael's necessities, do
more towards healing her wounded mind than any other thing what-
eYr.
 You must not refuse the gift, Michael,'' said Mr. DBell, after
hearing his narrativo to the end.  I o not wonder, little as she has
heen to blame in the matter, at her haring suffered greatly for all that
she innocently made you suffer; nor nm I at all surprised, since it was
in her power to do so, that she should wish to make you this atone-
ment. It comes at a lucky moment, my denr boy, for not only will it
enable you to present yourself before Miss Brotherton, without
throwing yourself, as you said yesterday, upon her charity, but I sus-
pect it may go far in assisting your hopes of entering into some busi-
ness, wich may enable you to support yourself,''
Mr. Bell then opened the bundle of notes, and found that they
amounted to rather more than five hundred pounds: a sum which,
to Michael, appeared so enormous that he uttered something like a
remnonstrance agaiast the opinion which adviscd his appropriating the
hole.
Did you not tell me, sir,'' he said, `` that Sir Mauhew Dowling's
affairs were not considered to be in so flourishing a state as they had
been? And may not this money be wanted by Miss Martha in case
he slould really become iavolved in difficulies''
I think there is no danger of her wanting it, Michael,'' returned
Mr. Bell, ` Let what will happen, I have no doubt that Sir Matthew

London taken, and all things ready for his setting off, sare that he
still expected an answer to a very cautiously-worded epistle which he
had eutured to address to Martha, informing her that he was setting
off for Nice, and that any letter or message she might wish to econvey
to Miss Brotherton, should be carefully delivered by her faithful
humble servant, M. A.
Michael was at breakfast with his kind and hospitable friends, when
a lad, bearing great marks of hasty travelling in his appearance, made
his way into the room, and with a lonk that seemed to prophesy eventful
tidings, if he were but asked for them, delivered a letter to Mr. Bell.
This proed, howaeer, to be only a blank coer, enclosing one to
Michael, which was handed to him, while the eyes of his host and
hostess fixed themselves with some anxiety on his face. Michael tore
open the despatch, and changed colour as be read it. Then, givig
an intelligible glance at the messenger who ceased not to wipe his fore-
heal with one arm, while he held his hat squeezei to his side wih
the other, he said, '`I should like to speak to you about this, Mr.
Bell,
Go into the kitchen, my lad,'' said the clergyman,'` and get some
breakfast. You shall know when the answer is ready.''
Though evidently disappointed at being thus dismissel unquestioned,
tho boy consoled himself with the hope of a kitchen audience, and
making his reverencee, retired.
eWhat in the world have you got there, Michaa1?' demanded M,
Bell. `' Not good nes, I amn atraid 2''
 No, indeed, sir,'' replied Michael, ` very far fromit.' It is from
Miss Martha Dowling, who seems to be in great distress.''
Read it to us, my gool fello, will you? If there is no reason
to the contrary,''
 WYhat is written here, sir, cannot long be a secret from any body.
This is what she says:
 Deur Michael1
Pray come to me at Dowling Lodge directly. There is no longer
any tdanger to be feared from my poor denr father, for he is very, very
ill-and I think you can be useful to me, which l am sure you will be
if you can. Alas1 Michael, you will witness a dreadful scenel1 My
poor father has kept every thing secret to the very last; meaning, lI am
sure, to prepare his family for it as well as he could. I could not
think what it was made him send all my sisters away to Arabella and
Harriet. The two little ones, inleed, as well us the three yongest boys,
are all at school, so that I am the only child he has left with him, my
elder brothers being all away in their different professions. I tell you
all this now, Mlichael, because I shall, I suppoese, have no time to say
any thing but on necessary business when you come here. Do not
delay, I amr sure you can be useful to me.

TIE LIFE AND ADVErUnES
 Poor girl TIis is sal indeed' eried Mr. Bell.  I imagine,
though she does not explain herself, that her father's affairs are fallen
into confusion. Yet I cannot guess what you can do for her. How-
eet, you must go immediately of course; and you had better hire a
chaise that no time may be lost. And I would advise you, ichael,
to take with yon the pocket-book which Mrs. lBell packed up for you
so carefully last night. I fear that it is but too likely yor prediction
will be fulfilled already, and that the poor young lady may be glad to
have some of her notes returned,''
 Thank God: that I was not gone,'' replied Michael, fervently.
It will be the geatest pleasure of my life, if I can be useful to
her:
Little time was lost in setting off; and certainly much before his
arrival had been hoped for by MIartha, Michael, who leftc his post-
chaise at a public-house near the lodge, was walking towards the
mansion by the same path in which he had so lately parted from her.
On entering the kitchen, the scene which met his eyes, explained at
the very first glance the nature of the business carrying on upon the
premises. A number of men were standing about, some few occupied
in sticking slips of paper inscribed ` Lot No.-,'' upon a variety of
articles which appeared to have been collected there for the purpose.
Others, with black canvass aprons and paper caps, were coming and
going with no very apparent purpose; while another set, with cold
meat and beer-flagons before them, sat round a small table in a cot-
ner, discoursing upon themes which appeared to occasion them much
merr ment.
Bu t among all these, there was not one that looked like a servant
of the house: and taking alvantage of the confusion which seemed to
license the freedom, he walked on without speaking to any of them,
and determined to trust to his memory for finding the small morning-
parlou which used to contain all poor Martha's littlc literary pessonal-
ties, and in which all his reading and writing lessons had been re-
ceived.
Neither his recollection nor his conjeture deceied him; he found
the apartment he sought, and on opening the door, discovered Martha
sitting there. IBut she was not, as he had hoped to find her, alone.
On a sofa placed opposite the windows sat a figure, bolt upright in the
middle of it, with a sofa-table before her entirely covered with trin-
kets, delicate Sevre china, miniature bronzes, and other valuable nick-
nacks. A quantity of cotton-waol lay on the sofa beside her, and her
long lean fingers were actively employed in selecting the most precions
articles, cnveloping them in the wool, and then cramming them into a
large basket that stoad before her,-sometimes selecting one, either
smaller or more precious than the rest, and thrusting it into her poeket
or up her sleeve. A large Indian screen was spread before the door,
which indueel MIichael, on hearing a soice that certainly was not that
of his friend Martha, to remain unseenlong enough to decide whether
his entrance would be likely to occasion her any embarrassment.

:I tell you, Martha, that you talk like a fool, and that is what yon
always were, and always will bel'' said the upright lady, in a shlrill
voice, but in a tone that she wns cndeavouring to reduce to a whisper.
 WYht right can any once of these horrid dirty fellows have with what
is mine, I should like to know? I am not going to be male bankrupt,
or sent to jail, or have my property seized, because your abominable,
wicked, low-born, brutal, treacherous, false father, has een found
out, and is going to be treated as he deserves. As for you, and all
the rest of your family, there is nothing to be said or done, I suppose,
but to submit, and just do what you can to get your bread. With
such- blood as you have got in your veins, thcre will be no great harm
done if you were all to go out as housemaids and footmen. Thething
happens among low people continually, if the father gets into distress;
but I should like to know who ever heard of a woman of quality, the
daughter of an earl, being treated in the same sort of unceremonious
wuy ?'
 But indeed, Lady Clarissa, it will be a great deal worse for my
fathier, if it is found out that his wife has been endeavouring to secrete
property,'' said MIartha.
 His wife, indced: A pretty sort of husband he has made me,
hasn't he? Having my noble arns painted on his paltry carriages;
and engraven on his plate, not a single ounce of which had heen
twenty years in his posscssion; and then, vulgar wretch 1 iusisting
upon seeing my housekeeper's account, for fear I should save any
thing out of the money he allowel met Pitiful, cheating, brutal,
manufacturing savagel But thank Heavenl my slavery is at an end
--To-morrow will see me many a good mile on my way to Scotland l
The monsters say I may take my,clothes and my money-and, my
clothes and my money.I will take, lI promise you, Miss Martha; so
I would really advise you to go and colleect your own things, and see
them put together decently.  You masy be able to sell some of them
perlaps, which might be very useful, and that would be spending
your time much more profitably, and decently too, than sitting there
lecturing me upon what I mnay, and what I maynot take. I shall take
eery thing that belongs to me, and there's an end of that; and I
wish to my heart you would just go away and leaveme in peace.''
Did I not know, Lady Clarissa, that my father would suffer for it,''
said Martha rising, `` I would not have troubled you with my rcmon-
strances: but I am certain that you arenow occupoied in abstracting
things that of right belong to my poor father's creditors, and if it is
discovercd, it may be the eans of heir refusing his certificate, and
he may be thrown into a jail for life.''
And where could he be better,  Miss Martha? I am sure I don't
know. My belief is that he is mad, or going to,be mad, and I don't
see but a jail is as comfortable as a mad-house, and as,it must
be a great deal cheaper, it will suit his circumstances a great deal
better. I wish you would go, child, and see if there is such a thing in
the house as a basin of soup for my luncheon. I may ring and ring,
but there is not a creature that will answer the bell now,''

failed him, and at times his temper has been so variable that I hae
seen hiviolently augry, and very intemperate in his language, one
minute, and enduring the insolence of Lady Clarissa, with the meek-
ness of a child, thcnext. And now-In short, Michael, I greatly fear
that his reason is shaken by the misfortunes that have fallen upon
him. He has kcpt all his commercial disasters so completely to him-
self, that not even his most confidential agents werc at all aware of
their extent; and I therefore hope that if l can contrie to remove
him from this melancholy scene, his mind will be relieved by feeling
that the worst is over, and that I may have the exceeding bhappiness
of seeing him restored to reason and to health.''
'And in what way then can I be useful to you, my denr MIiss
MIartha? I dare not combat your will, but it seems to mc that if his
creditors are stripping his house in this way, such a sum as yon have
put into my bands might be very useful to him,'' said ichael.
And so it ould, certainly, my good friend, if he had not pro-
vided for the exigences of this terrible moment, by having a large
sum of ready money in the house, a fact which he ltas confided to me
only,'' renliel Martha.  His marriage with Lndy Clarissa,'' she
continued,  has becn a greater misfortune to him, Nlichael,
than any losses in his business could possibly be. She has led
him a mnost wretched life-constantly keeping his high spirit in subjec-
tion by threntening to bring hcr brother upon him, if he treated her
with any want of respect, and my poor father's roeverence for rank
and title is such, that he has submitted to her in every thing. ut
during the terrible fortnight that has passed since the disclosure of his
ruin, her conduct has been perfectly frightful-and I feel quite certain
that whcn she has taken herself off to Scotland, which she intends to
do to-orow, my father will fceel so greatly relieved, that the very
best efecets upon his mind may be hoped for from it. What lI want
you to do for me, Michacel, is this: You must procure a postchaise
to be at the Lodge-gates to-night at twelse, The men who are left
in charge of the house, get both tired and tipsy hefore that hour, and
will be in bed and asleep; and then I think I shall e able to get my
poor father away from all the irritating objects which surround him
here. e has been very ill with violent spasms, and confined to his.
bed for a day or two, which one of the maids tells me is the reason
why he has not been more strictly watched. They think he is too ill.
to get avay. But he is greatly better to-day, and though I hae per-
suaded him to remain in bed, I think he has quite lost the complaint,
and will be able to get off if you will do what I desire of you. I
know not another being that I could trust. My poor father has spent
a great dcal of money, and been very liberal to many, but I do not
know one whom I do uot suspcct would be more ready to betra, than
to help him, if they saw him cndeavouring t get away. His physician,
Dr. Crockley, a man on whom he has heaped innumerable farouts, is,
I strongly suspect, acting as a spy upon him; and it is because lI ex-
pect his daily visit presently, that I will not let my father get up.
Therefore you see, Michael, there are some lifficulties to be en-

countered. Do you think you could manage t get a chaise to the
gates without its being known that it was for him ''
:I am quite sure of it,'' replied Michael ;  for to save timelI came
hither in a chaise myself, which is now waiting at the public-house to
take me baek to Fairly. I haveonly to go and tell the boy that I shall
ot be ablc to return before night, in order to have him ready to start
at any hour you please.''
T6 Fairly?'' caid Martha, musingly. `' But it is no matter-he
may sleep at the inn there as well as at any other, and the next morn-
ing we must make our way to the nearest port where there is a chance
of our finding a steam-boat going to France. Itwill not do at present
for my father to remain in the country. When he has got his certifi-
catc, he will be safe; but I greatly fear some difficulty about it.''
Wile Mlartha was thus explaining her hopes and fears, the sound
of carriage-wheels was heard slowly approaching by the road which
led to the ehief entrance, and which passed at no great distance from
the window at which they were sitting.
 Here comes Dr. Crocklcy '' she cxclaimed: ``I am sery glad his
visit willbe ovrer so early. This vill give me time for preparation.''
lBut she was mistakcn; the equipage she heard approaching was not
the recently sct-wp cab of Dr. Crockley, but the donkey-chair of the
ever active MIrs. Gabberly. Nothing could be much farther from
poor Martha's inelination than encountering the prying old woman at
this moment; but having hastily told Mlichael to appear as if he were
employed in taking a catalogue of the furniture, for which purpose,
ecr, ens, and ink lay conveniently ready on one of the marble-
slabs, she hurried out into the hall for thc purposc of meeting
the physician, and attending him as usual to her father-so that the
avoiding Mrs. Gabberly was impossible.
Oh, my poor dear Marthal that's you, is i(? Wall now: you
was just the person l wanted to see. But I do wonder you did not
get off with your father, poor manl when he made his escape, this
morning,'' said the unchanged little lady.
1 know not what you mean, Mrs. Gabberly,'' rcplied Martha
gravely.  My poor father has been extremely ill, and is at this
moment confined to his bed,'' The old lady gave a wink with one of
her little cunning black eyes, and nodding her head very expressively,
replied,  Olud birds are not caught with chaff, my dear.''
 hat is it that you mean, Mrs. Gabberly-that you do not bclievre
me ?'' said Martha, indignantly.
 You are very foolish to bawl out in that manner, my dear, with
that young fellow that's cataloguing in there, close withia hearing.
Mind, it is your fault and not nine, if he suspects any thing from you
violence.,''
You are taking an account of all the looking-glasses, are yo
not?'' said Martha, approaching the drawing-room door and addrcss-
ing Michael.  Yon may come into Sir Miatthew's room now, if you
please. IIe was asleep when I sent you away just now.'' Then,
tumning to Mirs. Gabberly, she added- Perhaps you would be so

good as to see my poor father, Mrs. Gabberly? I would not wish you
to stay tong with him, for he is very feverish; but I dare say he
would take it very kindly if you will juist come in to inquire far him.''
Looking a good deal surprised, but accepting the invitation with
great alaerity, Mrs, Gabberly began to mount the stairs: exceedingly
well pleased to have an opportunity of procuring so excellent a ticket
of admission to cvery house in the ncighbourhood, as this ocular
demonstration of the actual condition of the fallen knight would fur-
nish. MIichael, in compliance with the order he had received, followed
aftoer; and in a few minutes, found himself once more in the presence
of the man under wlose tyranny he had sulfered so trribly. Buta
harder hcat than Mlichacl's might have been softened into forgiveness
and forgetfulness of all former injuries, by the miserable aspect of the
wretched man who lay stretchei upon thae splendid bed that he
could no longer call hisowu. IIis steadfast-mindcd and affectionate
daughter-the only earthly good that avenging Heaven had left him-
cntercd first, intending to announce the visit of Mrs. Gabberly; but
Sir Matthew started up in het, and before she could speak, cried out,
 Do not lct that devil Crockley come to me, MIarthal I will not see
im, I tcll you. I have got no pain now; and if I had, don't I know
he would rather give me poison than physic? He is going to lose
his annuity, you know.''
Iis MIrs. Gabberly, dear papa, jst come to ask you how you
are,'' said MIartha, leading the old lady to the bedside.  Sho will
ot stay, because you are not well enough to talk; but you wyill be
glad to see her, will you not ''
Glad ?'' said thc miserable man, knitting his brows, nand throwing
upon her a look of deep aversion. te Don't I know her? Is she not
the town-crier of all the country round? Have I not paid her for it a
hundred timces? And do you think I don't know what she is come
for now ? Somebody else will pay her now, for bringing thcm word
how the poor bankrupt Dowling looks.''
Well now, that is terrible, to be sure t'' exclaimed Mrs. Gabberly.
e He is quite shook in his mind. Do you think he would be outra-
geous if I was to fcel his pulse, my dear? I should like to prescribe
for him-I should indeed. Poor dear man 1 His talking about paying
me is comical to be sure. Let me feel your pulse, Sir Matthew,
shall I2
Sir Matthew looked so very much as if he would have liked to take
her up in his enormous hand and throw her to the further end of the
roo, that Martha thought it prudent to prevent her nearer ap-
proach.
You have now seen my father, Mrs. Gabberly,'' she said with
emphasis,  and that, 1 think, is all that can be necessary for your
satisfaction.''
OhI certainly-it is very satisfactory,'' she replied, but without
appearing to have the slightest intention of leaving the room: for,in
truth, it wvas at that moment the place where, beyond all others, she
best liked to he. The downfal of Sir Mlatthew Dowling was the
3s0
TE LIE AND ADVEURES
subject that employed every tongue, and nobody could be so welcome
to every drawing-room, and every dining-room too, throughout the
neighbourhood, as one who could testify to having seen him, listened
to him, and ascertained how he seemed to bear it. It was impos-
sible that any person could have been better qualified for the service
than Mrs. Gabberly. Willingly would the still brisk little lady havre
crept under the toilet-table, or the bed itself, rather than have lost so
glorious an opportunity; and instead of attending to Martha's repeated
assurance that she ``had better go now,'' she began opening sundry
physic-vials that stood on a table at the bottom of the bed, smelling
some, tasting others, and pronouncing judgment upon all.
It is quite a mystery to me, my dear, whuat Dr. Crockley can be
thinkig of, giving such medicines as these to your father,'' said she.
I see, plainly enough, that he is in a very inflammable and irritable
state, and he ought to be put altogether upon the depleting plan.''
Then putting her finger on her lip, in sign of secrecy, she whispered,
IIl just stay here, Mlartha, behind the bed-curtains, till Dr. Croelley
comes, and I think it may be very useful for us to have a little con-
versation together. I know my poor dear father's method in these
cases as well as he did himself, and he was regular bred you ko,
which is more than we can say of puor dear Dr. Crockley.'
Exceedingly provoked, Miartha now adressed her father, saying,
Mrs. Gahberly wishes to stay, papa, till Dr. CGrockley comes, in
order that they may have a consultation about you; but you won't
like that, shall you''
 Like it ?'' replied the prostrate man, with bitterness,  Oh1 dear
yes, I shall likce it vastly1 They are exactly a fitting pair to come to-
gether, glowering and gloating round the bed of a ruined neighbour.
et her stay, by all means, Martha, let her stay and watch it all. See,
MIrs. Gabberly, there is a yong auctioneering gentleman come to
take an account of the furniture. Isn't it pleasant? I am sure it
must do your heart good to see it, Don't go aay, yong manI'' he
continued, aldressing Michael, who, shocked and disgusted, was
making his way towards the door.  Don't go away. Go on, neser
mind losing a little time, I dare say you will be paid for it all the
e., and my dear good neighbour would not enjoy it half so much
if sbe did not see somnething of the kind going on.''
' Oh, dear: oh, dearl quite wild and wandering? Isn't he?-
Calling Crockley and me a pair toot As if we ever thought of sueh
a thing1 I am sure, for one, I can answer for it that I never did.-
His doll of a wife, you know, hasn't been dead above a year, and I've
no notion of such quick work, it is quite indecent, I think. Good
gracious me, now I'' she continued, catching Sir Matthew's fierce eye
fixed npon her with a mixiure of hatred and bitter irony; '` what have
I said :-lll bet a guinea he fancies I mean sometbing about his mar-
rying himself up, all in such a hurry with ILady Clarissa.''
`` Lady Clarissal'' cried the knight in a loud voice. That's rightl

Martha-iell her to come here. Is she not my wife-bone of my

bone-flesh of my flesh? Is she not, Mrs. Gabberly ? And shall
she not come hither and share with me the delight of seeing a broker
taking possession of my furniture, and a dear good soul like you look-
ing on? Go, Martha, go when I tell you, and bring the right ho-
nourable Lady Clarissa Dowling here.''
`I am quite certain she won't come, papa,'' said MIartha, leaning
down, and whispering in his ear. :` So don't make me go to her,''
 But she slall, thougl?'' shouted Sir Miatthew, '' even if Igo
down, and fetch her myself. My dear Mlrs. Gabherly, my sweet Mrs.
Gabberly-will you have the great condescension to go for her? You
used to run about, if I did but hold up my finger, you know-and
on would not be so ungenerous as to refuse now, mnerely because l
am a bankrupt: Go to my Iady Clarissa, if you please, sweet Mrs,
Gabherly, and tell her that as she is a daughter of the noble house of
Highlandloeh, I wish, before we part, to give her a perting token of
remembrance. She knows that I wear a magnificent diamond ring,
Mrs. Gabbely, and you may just hint to her, if you please, that
nothing bas been takcn off my body yet. I do assure you it will be a
very pretty touching scene for you to witness, and talk about. It will
indeed. I am quite determinedt to have a seutimental parting and
ss she has told me that she mneans to set otf to-morrow, this will be
just the right time for it-von't it, MIrs. Gahberly 2''
Perfectly well disposed to execute the commission, and quite as de-
sirous as Sir Matthew could be that the proud poor lady who had
cver treated her with haughty coldness, should be properly humbled,
she darted towards the door, in order to perform her errand; but
MIartha, rememhering the manner in which she had left her step-
mother engagd, stepped Iorwsard to prevent her, quietly saying,  If
my father wvishes to see his wife, Mrs. Gabberly, I can go for her,
without troubling you-and I really wish you would permnit me to lead
you down stairs to your donkey-chair, at the same time-I am sure
you must be aware that papa is not in a state to bear seeing company.''
Yon are quite right, my dear, quite right, indeed-ir Matthei is
looking sadly wild and feverish, and I should say that nobody what-
ever but the doctor and his own family ought to see him. Of course
I suppose it would not be very convenient to hire attendants now, for
these sort of people, I am sorry to say, always insist upon ready money,
which is a cruel thing under such circumstances. t so it is, and
therefore it follows that youand ady Clarissa must be the chief nurses.''
Certainly, ma'am, it will be his owvn family who will wish to at-
tend tohim. And therefore, if you please, I will take you down stairs,
and see you to your carriage,''
 Mie: my dear:'' criel MIrs. Gabberly, in the shrillest possible tone.
 Surely you cannot mean to call such an old friend as I am, com-
pany?  No, no, my dear kartha. Don't think me such a brutel 1
would not leave you just yet, for the whole world1 You shall go
yourself, my dear, if ou will, and bring her ladyship up. I il stay

I ilI have her right honourable Iadyship here before that fellow
stirs a step, Martha. Do yon hear mc That's more than half the
fun,'' cried Sir Matthew, bursting into a shout of laughter. `` bDoesn't
she know our kind, clever, observing, neighbour, who is come here so
thoughtfully, just to look about her a litle? Doen't she know her,
almost as well as lI do? And won't she enjoy thinking what a pleasant
description dear Mlrs. Gaberly will be able to give of my Lord High-
landloch's sweet daughter watching the broker, and seeing that he sets
every thing down fair?''
Thankful was Iartha that the supposed broker was one who could
not in reality add to the horror of the scene. She turned to him as
she left the room, saying, `` You had better remain here, if you please,
till I return,'' upon which he modestly ensconced himself in a distant
corner of the room, and resting his paper upon a commode, continued,
as he stood, to scribble npon it.
uite certain that it would be impossible to get rid of MIrs. Gab-
berly till her father's summons to his proud wife had been obeyed, and
greatly more anxious to clear his room of this troublesomnc guest, than
to spare the feelings of her lalyship, Martha entered the little sitting-
room, determinel to deliver the message concerning the diamond-ring,
if she could not prevail without it. She found Lady Clarissa in the
act of finishing the paeking of her basket, by laying on the top of it
sudry light articles of female attire, very clcverly calculated to make
the whole pass under the general deseription of wearing-apparel, whicl
the courtesy ol the law permits to be removed by all persons in the un-
fortunate situation of her lalyship.
 Now I hope you will cease your impertinent preaching, Miss
Mlartba,'' she said, as the pale and agitated young wonan entered the
room. ` Unless every separate nightcap and frill are to be examined
one by one by these brutes, I conccive no objection can be made to
this package. Gather up the cotton-wool, and poke it somewhere out
of sight directly.'' Mnrtha obediently set herself to collect the
scattered fragments of the suspicious-looking wool, but as she did so,
said, :: MIy father wishes to see you, Lady Clarissa.''
Insolent wreteh1' exclaimed her ladyship, pausing in the act
of collecting various little articles for which she had not found room
in the basket, ``have yon the audacity to bring me this as a mes-
sage 7'
t My father says, Lady Clarissa, that as you are going to leave
him to-morrow, he should wish to see you once more,'' replied Martha.
MIonster 1'' sereamed Lady Clarissa stamping her foot upon the
floor, `` he, see me again3 he, dare to lift his bankrupt eyes upon the
noble woman he has so basely injured --Tell him, you bold messenger
who fear not to face the descendant of a dozen earls to convey to
her the words of a bankrupt cotton-spinner, tell him, that the only

excuse me in some degree in the eyes of my noble brother, for the
degrdation I brought upon him by acecepting itI' These last words
were uttered with clasped hands, raised eyes, fervent aecents, and all
other ordinary indications of uttering a prayer
Indignant and disgustcd, Martha felt no scruple in employing the
means her father had given her for obtaining the interview he desired,
and quietly said in reply to this burst, `` MIy father stated that his mo-
tive for asking to sec you, Lady Clarissa, proceeded from his wish to
prescnt to you, as a parting gift, the diamond ring which he wears on
lis righte hand.''
The effect of these words was as sudden as that produced by the
magic touch of a hand employed in turning off gas.
 That indeed is a mest natural wish1 Unhappy, guilty manl I can
well believe that had he the crown jewels at command, he would
dccm them all too poor an offering to atone for the offence he has com-
mitted against mei 1 thak God, MIartha Dowling, that my noble
blood has never taught me to forgct that 1 am a Christiant There
ure many women, believc me there are, of less cxaltcd rank than my-
self, who would not deign to obey such a summons. But I feel what
my duties are, and I shall nerve my courage to perform them. Como
with me to my dressing-room, Mlartha, carry that basket for me, and
then I wvill go with you to the bedside of' Sir Matthew.''
Martha attempted to obey, but the basket was too heavy for her to
carry, and she set it down again, declaring that the task was beyond
her strength.
 A tolerably good joke that,'' said Iady Clarissa,. endeaouriog to
Iaugh, `` considering your origin; but this is the last day of such
pleasant jestings, and therefore I must bear it with good humour I
supposc'' Then applyiogher owvn much stronger hand, she liftei ler
treasurc, and was stalking off with it; but stopped short erc she
reached the door, saying, ` No, I will stay here while you go and
fetch my faithful Mistress Saunderson. She enters into all my
feelings l thank God and is as strong as a Highland pony into the
bargnin.'' Having obeliently periormed this commission, and brought
back thc faithful Scotch waiting-woman, who had adhered very stead-
fastly to her mistress through all the vicissitudes of her fortmne,
Martha at length sueceedel in marshalling the Lady Clarissa Dowling
into thc bedroom of her husband.
No signet-ring ever made a deeper impression on wax, than the
dimond one of Sir Matthew had done on the memory of his noble
wife; and her first glance, as she entered the room, was direeted to
the hanl which lay on the bedclothes, that she might see if it had
been already removed; but no2 there it sparkled still, and with a
gentlcr aspect than she had been seen to wear since the tremondous
hour when the declension of Sir MIatthew, from the richest commoner
in the county into a bankrupt, had been announced to her, she
said,
%You wish to see me, Sir MIatthew-hMIartha says you wish to see
me.''

 Yes my belovoedI'' replied the knight. 'I do wish to see you:
ngelic sweetness IIow can I do otherwise? Look at yourself in
the mirror, most beautiful Clarissa? Look in the mirror hefore that
broker there carries it off and tell me if you think it possible thut any
man could bear to part with so much beauty, without having one finil
gaze upon it? Aud see, my dear, herce is your amiable ncighbour
Mrs. Gabberlyt Is it not kind of her to leave all other visitings,
that she may come to nestle herself here, among the very brokers, in
the very centre of our misery? It is so heavenly-minded of her,
isn't it? I guessed indeed that one great reason for her making such
a tremendous sacrifice was the hope of edification from beholding the
christian spirit with which your ladyship bears your lalyship's over-
throw; and besidcs her own improvement from it, she wishcs to have
it in her power to describe it to the whole neighbourhood. Very right
of her, isn't it, my dear? And that is the reason why I sent for yon.''
In general the nose of Lady Clarissa greatly outblushed her chccks,
which had more of the jonquil than the rose in them; but now, from
the tip of her high forehead, to that of her loug chin, she became
crimson; and but from thc remarkable length of her throat, which
seemed to rear itself in defiance of such danger a fit of apoplexy
might have becn expected.
: Begonel you vulgar gossin-picker !''she cried, turning in uncontrol-
lable rage upon the terrified little woman, `` and tell the contemptible
neighbourhood through which you are going to crawl in your donkey-
cart, like a snail in his shell, leaving your slime as you go, tell them
all, from me, that the best consolation under my remorse at having
forgotten my own dignity by condescending to hold a place among
them, arises from being released from the degradation of associting
withso contemptible a being as yourself, and all who are capuable of
listening to you'' And having uttered these words in a piercing voice,
she rushed to the door, threw it with great violence wide open, and so
left it, as she pacel, with rapid but tragic strides, to the shelter of
her own boudoir, and thie sympatliy of Mlistress Saunderson.
It was, perhaps, because the door was open, and that he knew the
sound would follow her, that Sir Mlatthew burst into the most violent
shout of laughter that ever made itself heard from mortal lungs: it
terrified Macthasmade Mlichael Armstrong shudder, and caused MIrs.
Gabberly herselfto wish she were any where clse, notwithstanding
thevery valuable information this extraordinary scene would enable
her to communicate. Long dlid this frightful laugh continue, and
when strength seemed to fail, and the boisterous merriment could be
ustained no longer, a vehement and reiterated hissing followod,
which at length ended in such complete exhaustion that Sir Matthew
fell back pale, and apparently notionless, upon his pillow..
: Mrs. Gabberly,'' said Mlartha, `1 must beg you to leave us now.
You must perceive that my poor fuather ought to be alone. It is very

sist in calling me company. Good gracious1 To think of the tcrms
on which l have always been in this house before your poor papa's un-
fortunate marriage: I cannot and I will not leave you in such a
condition. It would be perfectly monstrous, and every body would
call me a brute for it. Till Dr. Crockley has becn here, I really
neither can nor will go. I am .quite determined that I will hear what
he suys about him.''
Let her stay,'' said Sir Matthew, in a hollow whisper, which
proved that he was neither asleep nor dead, though his closcd eyes,
and ghastly countenance, might have been mistaken for one state or
the other.
Mlartha went to him, took his hind, wipel the' profuse perspiration
from his brow, and thcn placing herself in a chair beside him, con-
tinued to watch his altered countenance, alike unmindful as it seemed
of the presence of Mrs. Gabberly, or that of Michaecl either.
The lady, perfectly contented to be thus quietly established as a
looker-on, determined, for thc present, neither to move nor speak, lest
she might lose the valued privilege thereby; but Michael hecame so
cnscious of the awkwardness of his situation, and so fearful lest
Martha, from forgetting him, might get into a scrape likewise, that he
ventured to approach thc foot of the bed on tiptoe, merely for the
purpose of recalling himself to her recollection, and then, on seeing
her start at the sight of him, he snid in a whisper, ``I suppose I had
better go down stairs now, MJiss MIartha ?2''
Martha in reply to this nodded affirmatisely, and in the same low
tone added, `` I shall have other business to speak to you about. Do
not go away till you have seen me,''
Michael's eyes were naturally turned to MIartha while this passed;
but when he withdrew them, and was about to make lris retreat, he
caught the large, wide open, wild-looking ees of Sir Mlatthew fixed
earnestly upon him. The young man involuntarily dropped his eye-
lids, for the gaze was a frightful one, and turned to leave the room.
 tay :'' roared a hoarse but loud and stuuning voice from the
bel. `` Stay1 devil: demon 1 hell-bird: what do you come here for 2
Cowardly blackguard Do you think I do not know you? You
never dared to come till it was too late for me to hold youl I have
heard of your purring round thce place weeks ago. Butyou escaped me

think I should not know ye? Did you think I should forget those
d-d hypocritical eyes, and that hateful curly hair, of the devil's owsn
colour? No, my petty 'prentice, I have not forgottcn your crocolile
looks, and never shall. I suppose you thought you should bring me
to repentance by sending home word that you were dead. Was that
it, eh?
1Iam able now, Sir Mlatthew, to pay for leaing the mill before my
time, and I am quite ready to do it, if you please,'' replied Miehael,
gently. But he spoke to one who heard him not. Sir MIatthew had
a neck as short and thick as that of his lady was long and thin. IHis
last intcrview with her had not been a salutaryone for a man in his

state of mind and body; and the subsequent discovery of Michael,
of whose visit to the factory he had heard from Parsons, and at whose
escape he expressed the most unbridled rage, accelerated symptoms
which had before threatened him, and sent such a rush of blood to
the brain as instantly produced apoplexy, and left him totally deprived
of sense and motion.
.Martha, whose eyes were fixed upon him, uttered a fearful shriek,
and threw herself on the body, believing that he was dead. But MIrs.
Gabberly knew better, She had practised too long as an anateur
nROt to know a fit of apoplexy when she saw it, and promptly ex-
claimed, `` Get aay, Marha2 Get of of him, child 1 He is not dead,
I tell you, and, if we could but bleed him, he would open his eyes
again fast enough.''
WVIh the rapidity of lightning poor MIarth obeyed. She with-
drew herself from the bed, endeavoured to raise her father in her arms,
and, by the help of MIichael, succeeded. She then bared his arm,
bound her own waist-belt tightly round it, and with unshrinking cou-
rage had thrust a sharp penknife which she dren from her pocket
into a vein, before the skilful lady who had prescribed the measure
had half recovered her astonishment on perceiving that the poor girl
had conceived the projeect of putting it into immediate execution.
The old adage that `` where there is a will, there is a way,'' was
never better illustrated than by this act of the tender-hearted and
invalided Martha. She felt that her father's life hung on the prompt-
ness with which the opcration was performed; she felt too, that if she
shrunk fiom it, there was no one else who aould perform it, and
totally forgetful of herself and her own feelings conquered the re-
bellious weakness that would have held her hand, and did what
two minutes before she would have believed it utterly impossible she
could have done. The result did honour to the skill of MIrs. Gab-
erly. The lazy current flowed, though reluctantly. Sir Matthew
opened his large eyes, rolled them from side to side, heaved a deep
and hcawy sigh, and presently attempted to speak, but tis was
beyond his power,
i WVhat more should be done?'' said the pale, and now trembling
MIartha, turniog towards Mrs. Gabberly.
hy now, my dear, you must just let iim alone for a little bit,''
replied the physician by hereditary right. ee Well now 1'' she added,
 WVasn't it a blessing that I was here? If I had not staid, he would
have been as dead as mutton by this time.''

fScn was the state of affairs in the bedraom of Sir Matthcw Dow-
ling, when Dr. Crockley entered it. Were all the words which Mrs.
Gabberly tlen uttered in explanation of what she had done, why
she had done it, and how her doings had answered, to be written
down here, my waning pages would hardly suftice to contain them.
Dr. Crockley nodded. winked, approved, anl applauded s greast
deal, joked a little, and finally felt the patients pulse, observing at
the same time that it was necessary at any rate to bring him round
sufficiently to get a little talk on business out of him, before he pop-
pel off for good and all.
Very right anl poper if you can manage it, doctor,'' sagaciously
observed MIrs. Gnahberly, ` But yon may depend upon it, that-'' and
here she whispered someihing, that it was especially intended Martha
should be neither the better nor the worse for. he doctor nodded
anl winked, anl nodlded again; and then turning to the poor girl
who was not only the one who alone in that presence cared any thing
for the prostrate millocrat, but the one of all created beings who
would alone have felt his death to be a cause of mourning. Dr.
Crockley turned to her, and with very little of even the external
decency of sympathy said,  Do you think you can anage to get
some mustard, my dear, out of the clutches of the bailiffs2?-because
that is what we want here.''
Without answering, MIartha moved towards the daor: and Michael,
not conceiving that thc physician's words were but a brutal jest, and
fancying that Mlartha might really have to petition those who now held
authority in thehousehold for the article wantetd, steppel after her, to
request that he might execute the commission in her place.
 You shall cone down with me, MIichael,'' she replied, `'` and I
doubt not yonu will be able to procure what we want without difficulty.
But alas : Michael, it will avail nothing--I am sue by their whispe-
ing, that they both know it will avil nothing. Nevertheless it shall
be tried. But is it not deadful that of all his numerous family there
should be only one to receive his dying breath? O God1'' she
added with clasped hands and streamning eyes,  if 5t be a jdgment,
let it atone for all that has been wrong: For surely it is a heavy
one t'
On reaching the hall, the pitying Michael, who in the suflerings of
is fiend forgot all the cruelty of his eney, insisted upon going
alone into the thronged and noisy offices, while she sat down to wait
for his return. He did his errand promptly, and was by her side again

in a minute or two; but he found that she hnd left the chair on which
he had placed her, and was now pacing up and down the hall in
violent agitation.
:I am overpowered, I am borne down by all this horror-this
deepn and bitter grief:'' he exclaimed.  And there is not a single
human being near me, but your ill-used self, Michael, from whom I
am likely to find any real kindnessl The conduct of all with whom
I have had intercourse since my poor father's distresses came upon
him, has been such as to make me wish rather to shun, than seek
them at this awful moment, yet I want some one to tell me ho I
ought to aet. 1 know that fearful man Parsons, who is greatly in his
confidence, had business of importance to settle with him; for again
and again my father has said to me, since the execution has beeu in
the house, that let what would happen, he must find time to speak to
him. Ought I not then to send to him in this extremity ?'
e ould to Heaven I were fitter to advise yo, my dear Miss
Martha 1'' replied Micehael, with equal respect and tenderness. Cer-
tainly if such were your father's words, it is very right to remember
tlem. Shall I go to the factory and summon MIr. Parsons hither 2'
OhI It is hatueful to me,'' replied poor Martha, `` to call such a
being to his deathbed But it may be that the interests of others
are at stake, and when I recall my father's earnestness as he spoke of
the necessity of seeing him, I tremble at the idea of disobeying him.
Go then, Michael : hasten to the factory, and tell this man that his
master is very ill, but that if he recovers his senses and his speech, it
is prohable he may wish to speak to him.''
Michael lost no time in obeying her; and on reaching the mills
found the superintendent, as usual, at his post. At the first glance
he did not recognise the messenger, for the appearance of the young
man was greatly changed by the style of equipment which, under
the advice of MIr. ell, had been provided for him. No sooncr did
Michael speak, however, than the man started, as if he had been
shot.
eir Matthew send you'' he exclaimed, "` what mountebank tricks
are you gol at now, you young villain What1 did you think that
this fine toggery conld amboozle me? Has it relly bamboozled
him? Have you, faith and troth, contrived to pass yonrself off upon
your dearly-belocd benefactor as a gentleman of fashion and fortune
who was come to make him a visit of condolence tpon his misfortunes?
A capital fellow, ain't you? or, perhaps, my nice yong grandee, you
fancy his grinders are drawn, and that he can't, or won't, maybe, have
any thing to do, now that he has fallen into trouble, with putting
such an elegant yeung gentleman to inconvenience  Is that it? But
it is just possible that other people may be more at leisure. Who
knows ?''
Neer mind me now, Mr. Parsons,'' replied Michaal, utterly in-
different, at that moment, to any thing, and every thing, that his old
enemy miglt attempt for the purpose of anoying him.  Never think
of me or my affairs, at such a time as this. ou hare given me no

opportunity to speak, or you would have understood that it was not
Sir Matthew who sent me here, but his daughter. Sir MIatthew was
too ill, when I left the house, to know any thing about it; but Misc
MIartha thiuks that, if he recovers his speech and senses, he may wish
to speak to you,''
t Like enough'' replied the superintendent with a sneer.  Sir
Matthew's troubles have nowisc changed his nture. The young lady
is quite right: but I shouldn't have thought as he'd have told her any
ling sbot it, either. Not but what she might approve the job, teo,
if she ha got any spirit in her. But she is but a poonr, puling sort of
a cretur, much as she was when she used to cosset yol, my beautiful
master runaway apprentice. IHowever, neer mind that now, as you
say, ny pretty master: there's a time for all things. You may just
step in here while I change my coat. It bean't the first time as you
hae entered this pleasant building, Master Mike, is it2''
Mlichael was going to obey him: but, at the moment he was about
to pass the threshald, something in the eye of the superintendent made
him pause. He recollected full well the ready lock of that once hated
door; and it struck him, as by no means impossible, that his old ac-
quaintance might turn it upon him, if he put it in his power to do so.
Fears for his own personal safety, he certainly had none, being quite
awvare that he was no longer in danger of being kidnappel as hereto-
forc; but the idea of Martha being left, at this her utmost need, in
want of any little service he could afford, was quite enough to make
himn cautious, and with something of an involuntary smile, he steped
back, saying, ``There is no occasion for me to wait for you, Mr.
Parsons: I huve delivered my message, and you may obey it or not,
as you please. At any rate, you cannot want me to show you the way
to bowling Lodge.'' And so saying, he turned round, and walked
out of the yard.
 Peaslilent young vipert'' muttered the superintenlent between his
closed teeth. s That I should live to see him strut off before me in
that fashion : But I1'Il have a try if 1 can't plague him yet. Fool
that I was, when lhad him snug by myself on Ridgetop Mloor, not to
give him one farewell thrashing with the horsewhip. IrI had put out
a joint or two, it would have been no great matter; and then I should
have been spared the d-d sight of him now, marching off-hang himl
like a pcacock before mel As to changing my coat, that's fudge.
People don't trouble themselves to change their coats, when they are
gig to pay their compliments to an apoplectic bankrupt.''
Having fairly got beyond all the bolts and bars immediately within
the jurisdiction of MIr. Parsons, Michael slackened his pace, being
rather inclined to have the society of his former tyrant, than not.
 Si MIatthew appears to be in a very dangerous statc, Mr. Parsons,''
said he, as soon as the sulky superintendent came up to him.
Perhaps your right honourable greatness has been studying medi-
ciae, sincc I hud the pleasure of taking that little drive with you into
Derbyshire?''
36o
TRE LIFE AD ADVENTURES
I have studied many things since that time, Mr. Parsons,'' replied
Michael, laughing: '` and one is the nature and use of locks.''
The'tone in which this was answered was so brutal, that the young
man, rather from disgust than anger, walked on faster than his foe
could follow him; and reaching thc house some minutes before him,
made his way again withont ceremny-for it was no time for it-into
the apartment of Sir MIatthew. A considerable change had taken
place in the condition of the patient since he lcft it. The cataplas
had so far succeeded as to restore animation and consciousness: Sin
Miatthew, still surrounded by Martha, Mlrs. Gabberly, and the doctor.
was gazing upon them with widely-opened eyes, wlich, though wild
and wandering in expression, were evidently not levoid of speculation.
MIichael had enterel very gently, but not without being heard by the
sick man; for he turned his eyes full upon him as he approached.
The sight of him, however, no longer seemed io produce any cmotion:
for after looking quictly at him for a moment, Sir Matthew turned his
gaze upon Mrs. Gabberly, wha from bcing in the act of leaning over
him, brought herself particularly within his sight.
eIe Parsons come?'' said MIartha in a whisper.
Ile must be in the hall by this time,'' replied Michael: ` shall I
tell him to come up ''
 My dear fatler has not yet spoken,'' she said; `` but, perlaps, he
may understand me.-Parsons is herce, papa,'' she addcd, taking her
father's haud, and leaning over him-` should you like to see him ?''
He is in London, my dear,'' replied the knight very distinctly.
 Thank God :' exclaimed Mlartha, tenderly kissing him- Thank
God1 His speech is not in the least afected I'
Rather wandtring, thogh,'' said Dr. Crockley, winking his eye
at MIrs. Gaberly.
 I should say, hlced him again, if you want to get any thing out cf
im;'' observe Mrs. Gabberly, looking sagaciously at the doctor.
 Perhaps I may, in an hour or two,'' he replied, applying his finger
to the pitient's pulse.
Sir Matthew fixed his eyes upon him, aud laughed a horrid, rattling.
ghastly sort of laugh, that seemed to come from his throat.  You
haven't quite doe with me yet, have yon, Crockley '' sai he.
Donc with you, my dear friend? God forbid:'' repliel the phy-
sician, rather startled at the apparently healthy state of his patient's
intellect, and affectionately smoothing his pillows, and settling the
bedclothes about him.
 WVould you like to see Parsons, dear papa:'' said Martha, gently,
and again bending over him,
 Oh, yes?'' he replied cagcrly; I'Il see Parsons now, directly-I
should be very sorry not to sce Parsons. I may lie, or lI may die,
you know; but I must sce Parsons.
MIartha immediately left thc room, intending to explain to the
superintendent, before she brought him into it, the state in which her
father lay, and the necessity of receiving any arders he might wish to

give, wih as little disturbance to him as possible. On reaching the
hall, however, she saw him not, and was on the point of returning u
stairs to inquire of Mlichael where he had left him, when she caught
the sound of his voice from Sir MIatthew's study. On entering this
room she perceivedl not only MIr. Parsons but Lady Clarissa, who,
standing belore the comnmode in which, as she happened to know, her
husband was accustomed to keep papers of importance, as wcll as
money, appeared to have becen very assiduously examining its con-
tents; for every recess had evidently been visited, and, as one of her
hands was tightly clutched over a pocket-baook, it seemed that her re-
searches had not been wholly in vain, and that she had not privately
obtained possession of his keys for nothing.
I was sent for, my lady,'' said Parsons, apparently rcplying to
some question of her ladyship's, which, to judge y her angry frown,
and the vexed expression of her countenance, had not been a civil
DC.
MIy father wishes to see Mr. Parsons directly,'' said Martha.
 And by your ladyship's leave I must take that green pocket-book
with me,'' sadid Parsons.
 What pocket-book, you rude fello ?' rcplied ILady Clarissa, in-
lignatly.
 That one as your ladyship now holds in your left hand,'' replied
the contidential superintendent.
I wondcr, sirrah, that you do not ask me to give you the rings
off my fingers I'' cried the angry mistress of the mansion. Go to
your master, fellow, if he has sent for you, and I shall go too. So
you need not trouble yourself about the pocket-book.''
And with these words she pushed past both Martha and Mr. Par-
sons, preceding them to the sick mans chamber. By the time they
entered it his eyes were again closed, but he appeared to breathe
without difficulty, though rather more audibly than usual, and
Martha fancicd that he was asleep.
 Hush:'' said she.  Do not disturb him. He is sleeping.''
Dr, Crockley and MIrs. Gabberly had withdrawn to a window, and
were evidently in consultation; hut whether on the symptoms of
apoplexy, or bankruptcy, might be doubtful. Miclael, however, was
standing close beside the bed, and in answer to Martha's obeervation
shook his head, saying,  NoI nat asleep.''
Then he'll manage to her wht Ive got to say to him,'' said
Parsons, advancing, and throing a glance of spiteful vengeance at
Lady Clarissa, `` because it is just what he wants to know.''
At the sound of Parsons's voice Sir MIatthew opencd his eyes, and
made an effort to raise himself, but this was beyond his power, and it
was only by being lifed withi as little effort as possible on his own
part, as if he were already dead, that he was placcd in the attitude he
seemed to desire, and in which he was supported by pillows, and by
thc arms of poor Mlartha, who had placed herself on the bolster
behind him.

It was a frightful and awful expression which then took possession
of his sunken features, nevertheless a hateful sort of smile made part
of it.
. Parsonsl that's you, isn't ? That's Parsons that stands
there2'' he said, directiag his misty eyes full upon the superinten-
dent.
Yes, Sir Matthew, 'tis me,'' replied the man.
Have ou done my bidding, Parsons ?'' demandcd the knight,
with a sort of gasping which seemed to threaten that his breath was
about to leave him.
Yes, Sir Matthew, it's all regularly male out,'' replied Parsons,
'nobody can mistake now about times or dates in any way,''
``And isn't that the Honourable Lady Clarissa?'' said the sick man,
directing his eyes towards her.
Yes, Sir Matthew,'' replied Parsons, with something like a titter.
 Then-then-then,'' panted the dying man, `` let her ladyship
know what was the last business that I gave you instructions about,''
 A very fitting business for an honourable gentleman to attend to,
when his affairs are in confusion, and he not in an over good state of
health,'' replied the confidential servant, turning himself round, so as
exctly to face her ladyship.  No less n nilatter than restoring three
good tlousand poeunds a year, for ever, towards clearing scores with
his creditors.'
Now three thousand pounds a year was exactly the sum, for the
settlement of whiceh upon herself, a daughter of the noble house of
Highlandloch had condescended to assume the name of Dowling, and
the mention of the often-meditated sum roused her ladyship's attention
so effectually that her face involuntarily protruded itself beyoud her
body, till her nose very nearly reached that of the individual who
was addressing her.

die when he will, won't have it upon his conscience that he defrauded
his creditors to make a settlement upon any lady in the land, gentle
or simple; becanse you see he has left proof, plain and clear, that he
had committed more than one act of bankruptcy hefore he made the
settlement upon her ladyship, ant for that good and excellent reason
her ladyship will have no right to one single penny that he leaves
behind him; and that is a comfort to an honest man like me, who
likes to see justice done to high and low,''
 VIlain I'' screamed Lady Clarissa, it is falset''
 No, no, no, no l'' issued from the pillows, in a voice that shook
with ghastly laughter.  True, all true; and now shemay go to
Scotland.''
Just ask her to give you your green pocket-book, Sir Matthew,
or cnan ARSrRONG.
368
efore she goes,'' said Parsons, grinning. I saw her ladyship take
it out of your bureau, and ir she will be pleased to open her hand, I
think it will tumble out of it.
WVith a lIook of inexpressible rage, Lady Clarissa turned away from
him and made towards thc door.
Stop her, Crockley'' cried Si:r Matthew, feebly, alding with
panting difkficulty, `` and--you-shall-have-it.''
Dr. Crockley hal a great respect for the peerage, and ould, be-
yond all question, have preferrel snatehing a pocket-book from nine
hundred and ninety-nine untitled ladies in succession, rathcr than
from one Lady Clarissa; but he felt that this was no moment for cere-
mony, and obeying what was very likely to be the last behest of his
patron, he rolled his fat person after her with cxtraordinary muscular
exertion, and grasping the lady's robe with one hand, seized on her
rigidly clenched fist with the other, in such a sort, that, according to
the prophecy of MIr. Parsons, the green pocket-book dropped out
of it.
Unfortunatcly, however, the attitude in which this feat was per-
formed, was one which could not be retained by the ill-balanced
person of the doctor, aftcr the supporting form of the lady on whom
he had thrown himself had escapcd from his grasp, and, struggling
with as much anxious care as Csar to fall well (i.e. upon the
pocket-book), he measured his length upon the ground.
Parsons, though certainly not hoping for so lucky an accident, had,
with the same sort of instinct which brings the crow besidle a sickly
sheep, followed closely the rectreating steps of her ladyship, and ad-
roitly jerking the coveted poeket-hook with his foot, so that it should
escape the being buried under the stumbling physician, pepared him-
self to dip and catch it. But the success of the maneuvrc was lese
perfect than its ingenuity deserved; for ere his tall rigid person had
bent itself sufficiently for him to reach the ground, MIrs. Gabberly,
who had becomc onc of the groupat thc same instant with Dr. Crock-
ley, was in possession of it, and ere the prostrate Crockley or the
stooping Parsons could raise their eyes, the prize had dropped into
the decpest recesses of a prodigious pocket, which reached nearly to
the bottom of her little petticoat.
It is probable that both inquiry and search might have been insti-
tuted in consequence of this, had not the condition of the patient at
that moment rendered it impossible. Sir Matthew's ghastly eyes had
fixed themsclves on ILady Clarissa during the foregoing scene, but as
if, though they had still the power of discerning objects, they ha lost
 that of moving after them, he appeared to lose sight of her as she
approached the door, and the heavwy orbs seemed seeking for some-
thing on which to rest themselves without any change of position. It
chanccd that Michael, who, quite aware that the last moments of Dir
MIatthew were approaching, determined not to leave the premises till
he had learned the wishes and intentions of Martha, was at that mo-
ment moving from the corner he had occupied near a window, not
within sight of the bed, to a table exactly at the foot of it, on which
36A
TIE LIFE AND ADVENTURES
was placed a facmn of Cologne vater, which poor Marth, almost ex-
hausted by the painful attitude necessary to sustain the pillows, had
made him a sign to get for her. This movemeut brought him withlin
the range of Sir Mlatthew's eyes, and something in his aspect as he
cautiously bent to take the bottle, or else the thick-coming fancies of
a brain diseased, though not paralyzed, suddenly produced a terrible
effect upon the dying man, and he uttered a cry soharsh and terrible
as to constrain the attentian een of the preoccupied group at the
door.
t There's a dead ody walking nbout the room'' he ejaeulated in
an unnatural and frightful accent. : He is come for me and I must
go?'' The shriek which iollowed these words wvas terrible. In a
minute or two he spohe again, but almost in a whisper. ` One
No 1--it is not one, it is five hundred. Take them-take them
away from me, I tell yon: They are all dirty, beastly factory-children,
Their arms and legs are all broken and smashed, and hanging by bits
of skin. Take them away, I tell you, Croekley: Their horrid joints
will drop upon mel They are dangling and ioose, I tell yon'' and
then again he shouted with so fearful a ory, that even Parsons pressed
his hands upon his ears to save them t(rom thc sound.
 Calm him1 calm him 1'' cried the trembling Nlartha.  Can you
not give him something that may still this dreadful agony, Doctor
Crockley ?'
` It is not a very easy symptom to master, Miss Martha,'' replied
the physician drily.  However, it is not likely that it will last long.
All the life that's leftis jast about the heart and brain, which is always
unlucky if there happens to be any thing particular upon the mind.''
: ParsonsI'' cried the dying man, again raising his voice, but with-
out looking towards the person he aldressed.  Parsonsl are you
not ashamed of yourself to turn the whole set of them out pon me
at once in this way? Yon that have paid, and bribed, and tipped so
often1 Rascal1 Take them off me, I tell you1 Do you mean that
they shall stile me? They will stifle me:-they will, they will. I

Papalny dear, der papa 1'' cried Martha, bending forwsard till her
cheek touche that of her father.  Compose yourself: It is only
that yon are siInwell and fancy things. There are no children here,
papa, but your oyn Martha.''
. Her tendercaresses, and her gentle voice together, seemed to reach,
and quiet for a moment his wanlering intellect. He made an effort to
turn his head towards her, but that was impossible; and Mlichael, who
had, upon his first frightful cry, removed himself to the head of the
bed, where the eye of the wretched man could not reach, silently
offered to take MIartha's place, that she might station herself where it
could. . She quickly understood him, and in a moment stoodl where
that dying eye could gaze upon her. Ilis hand, with its glittering
ring, still lay npon the bed; she took it in hers, and fondly chafed and

But it was too late; his lips never opned more. For some hours
longer he continued to breathe. but, on again feeling bis pulse, Dr.
Crocklcey declared that ils faint pulsations must inevitably cease
before night.
I suppose your old servant Betty Parker is still in the house.
Miss Marha?'' sid he. The poor girl bowced an affirmatie, but had
o power to speank.
Wall, then,'' said the doctor,`' I should recommend that you
should put her to sit here; it is no god for any of us tao stay any
longer, for it's all over just as much as if he was already in his coffin.
You had beter go away, and see what you can pack up to get of
with, Miss Martha, that's all that is left to be done, as far as 1 can
see. Come, Mirs. Gabberly,'' he adled, I have got a friendly word
or two to sny to you, so your boy shall mount my pony and I'Il drive
yonr onkey for you.'' And so saying, he took the little woman
nder his arm and trudged off, without waiting for her to inform him
whether she approved his proposal, or not. Mlr. Parsons, giving one
scowling look at the silent bed, followed them, and MIartha and
Michael were left together beside the dying an.
Upon perceiving the totally uncouscious state into which Sir Matthew
had fallen, Michel had gentl withdrawn himself from behind his
pillows, and now stood, almost as silent and motionless as himself,
beside the bel, respectfully waiting to receive from the desolate and
eeping lartha some hint or iustruction respecting his staying where
he was, or leavsing her. Never, when the poor dependant of her
family, ha le young heart of Michael been impressed with a feeling
of respect so profound as he at that moment felt for the unhappy girl.
ln truth the feeling was so powerful as to interfere with his usefulness,
for he shrank from appearing to put himself forward too presumptuously
by giving her advice, or venturing in any degree to dictate what it
might he best for her to do. Bnt when, after remaining thus bash-
fully silent for a quarter of an hour, he perceived that she gave no
other sign of life than by tears that flowed ineessantly, and sighs that
seemed to hcave her breast `` almost to bursting,''-when he saw this,
he began to think that some degreo of seeming presumption on his
part might he better and more profitable for her, whom he would
really hve died to serve, than the continuance of a degree of defer-
ence, which must render him useless. Approaching, therefore, to the
chair on which she had thrown hersclf, he ventured to say, `` Miss
Marthal where can l find your old servant etty Parker? I remember
her very well-she used to be always in the nursery. If you would
tell me where she is likely to he, I will go for her.''
Poor Martha for a moment ceased to weep, and looked up at him.
 Michael ArmstrongI'' she replied, l am not conscious of ever
having ijured any human being but yourself; and yet you are the
only one who is near to support and help me at this dreadful hour.
God bless you for your kinness, my god boy: o nt go away,
MIichael-that is, I mean, do not leave the house till all is over-in-
deel, I think you may e useful to mel'
366
THE IIRE AND AVErTURES
 Mies Martha,'' he returned, ` will you trust me to sit here, while
you yourself summon whomever you may wish to keep you company-
I will keep out of sight in case-'' and here he stopped.
His eyes will never open maore, Michael:'' she replied, while the
tears again burst forth, '` and thank God their last look at me was
gentlel lBut I almost fear to leave the room, Michael-I would not
that he should breathe his last and I not by him,'' But Miclael,
unskilful as he was, felt that the scene was too awful a one for the
poor girl to be left alone in, and he therefore persisted to declare with
the authority which sch subduing sorrow gives to all around who
will take the trouble to exercise it, that he would watch by the bed-
side of her father while she sought the old woman mentioned by
Dr. Crockley.
Reluctantly, and unresistingly she consented, and giving a look at
the bed that seemed to wring her ery heart, she uitted the room,
leaving Michael rmstrong alone with the motionless mnss of still
living clay, hefore which he had so often trembled.
How strangely eventful had been the interval between those well-
remembered days, and the one actually present with himI How
extraordinary the change in thce circumstances of both parties: It
was not triumph, but it was thankfulness, which Nichael felt, as the
sense of this came fully upon him during these moments of profound
stillness; and the result of all the moving thoughts that crowded
upon his mind was an earnest prayer to Hleaven that he might never
be placed in any ciscumstances likcly to harden his heart. and make
him the cause of suffering to others,-a fearful and a dreadful crime,
which he felt, as he gazed with tremnbling ae on the sunken features
of the living corse before him, must in the sight of God be held
as one of the most daring rebellion to his heavenly will of which man
is capable.
Solemn and solitary as was Michael's position in the chamber of
Sir Matthew, the interval of Martha's absence did not seem long.
She returned accompanied by the old servant who hnd been nursery
attendant, though never raised to the dignity of nurse, from the birth
of the eldest child of the family, and who was the only one remaining
of all the numerous household who retained the slightest feeling of
attachment to any of them. To her, habit stood in the place of
preference, and she might perhaps be said to love all the Dowling
children, from the eldest to the youngest; a sentiment which led her
to conceive, as in duty bound, a most hearty detestation of their step-
mother. It was, therefore, with something very like pleasure that she
obeyed a summons so solemn and soperemptory as to justily her, even
in the judgment of Mrs, Saunderson, for laying aside the ironing-hbox,
which she had been plying incessantly for two whole days upon the
frills and furbelows of Lady Clarissa, in order to obey it. On per-
ceiving the condition in which her master lay, Betty Parker strongly
advised poor Martha to retire, urging the uselessness of her remaining
to look upon what was so grieous, when a baby might see at half a
gance that the poor gentleman could not tell friend from foe. But

368
T LIE AND ADETDRE8
Michael watched the overloaded ehicle roll by with great satisfac-
tion.  Whateer happens,'' thought he,  Miss Miartha must be
better without her,'' Relieved by knowing that he should not again
run the risk of encountering her delectable ladyship, Mlichael immedi-
ately took his way to the magnificent mansion she had forsaken, and]
perceiving that the hall-doors stool wide open, preferred passing
through them to encountering again the motley throneg that had taken
possession of the offices. But instead of finding this portion of thc
house as quiet and foraken ashe had left it, he was startled by hear-
ing, as he mounted the steps of the stately portico, a multitude of
oices in violent altercation.
At first he felt disposed to turn away and seek another entrance,
but the vehemence of the sounls he heard excited his curiosity, and he
went on. Instead of one, half-a-dozcn strangers might have entered
without running any risk of having their right there challenged; so ll
great was the confusion that reigned; and MIichael might have passed
up the great stairs, and into the chamber which it was his purpose to
visit, without any difficulty. But he was prevented from taking im-
mediate advantage of this, by hearing words which excited new fears
for the unfortunate MIartha; and, ere he had listened many minutes, he
became aware that a new creditor had reached the lodge after he left
it, who had come, armed with proper authority, to arrest the knight,
dead or alive. Nor did the discussion of this event canse all the up-
roar; for the agents of the parties who had previously sent in the ex-
ecution were threatening with all sorts of punishnent, several of the
servants, whom they accused of having been bribed to assist Lady
Clarissa in the removal of many valuables which she had no richt to
take. It was not this part of the tumult, hoever, that interested him
and, having obtained but too clerly the information that Sir Matthew,
was arrestcd, he once more sought for the unhappy Martha in thee]
dismal chamber whcre he had left her. And therc he found her; but]
with such frightful adjuncts to her natural grief, that the state of quiet]
,ee;e  eeeeie wvues
ensiable compared to that in which he found her now.
Sir Matthew had breathed his last, and the corpse was already ar-]
ranged with decenecy upon its stately bed; but, on each side of it stood
an officer, whose duty it was to violate by their presence the solemn
sanctity of that dismal chamber, and to prevent the body's being
carried to the grave, till the cluims of their employer were satisfied.
In front. of her father's corpse, with her troubled eyes (no longer
bathed in the healing dew of natural sorrow), turning from it to its
rude guardians, and back again to all that was left of the sinful being
she had so fondly, blindly loved,-stood the wretched daughter, so
sad a spectacle of woce, that it was cvident the men themselves turned
their hard eyes studiously away, because they feltas pang of pity as
they looked upon her.
Come with me, Miss MarthaI'' eried Michael, unceremoniously
seizing her arm. " Yon must not, you cannot remain here. on
can do no good, Miss MIartha; all is oer now1 You must come
oF MIICIIAEL AISTRONG-
36o
away, yo nust indced,'' The only anser that poor Martha gave,
was torcibly shaking off the hand that held her, and then pointing,
first to her father's body, and afterwards to the two unseemly attend-
ants who stood beside it.
`tIt ie no use, youing man, to strive with her,'' said Betty, who was
still occupiel in completing some of her lugubrious operations about
the bed:  I know her hetter than you do. She will stay here
watching him till she is as dead as he is, rather than go away, and
leave his body to be tended by such as those.'
For a moment Michael really felt all the enervating effects of de-
pair, and stool perfectly incupable of even imagiaing any means of
help for tho agony which it wruing his heart to witness. But, as the
old woman pursued her ghastly occupation, she went muttering on,
expatinting on the sinful and unchristian outrage that was thus com-
mitted.  And what will the rogue get by it'' she said. : Does ha
mean to shows the corpse for a farthing a head to his factory black-
guards? Isn't he as big a fool as he is knae2
No, mistress, no, by no means,'' said the friendly defender of
Mr. Joseph Parons:-for it was at his suit that the body of Sir
MIatthew had been arrested.--`` You may call the superintendent
9gue, or knave, or what you will of that kind, and I don't suppose
]that there's many as vould contradiet yo: but, as to his being a fool,
specially as to the doing what he has done here, that he is not.
['Twas his only chance.''
]And how much do you think he'll make of it?'' demanded old
]Beuty with a sneer.
] Why, just the four hundred and sixty-seven pounds as is due to
]him,'' replied the man.
]To all this poor Martha appeared not to pay the slightest attention,
]and, in truth, neither undertood nor heard a word of it; ut Michael
did, and with sudden animation stepped up to the man who had
rspoken, and whispered in his ear, :: Perhaps we may be able to settle
tthis business withont any further difficulty. Step out of the room
with me, will you, for a moment: your companion can do all that is
]necessary withoeut you.''-- Neither I nor my employer are people to
:::::::.
They accordinely retired together: and in a wondrously short spaice of
time the uninitiated MIichael was made to understand all the circum-
stances of the case, the most important of which was that if, as Mr.
Parsons hoped and expectel, Mliss Martha could find ready money
]enough quietly to pay his little private account with the late Sir
Matthew, the arrest would be immeliately withdrawn, and the body
]left for her to dispose of it at her pleasure.
]``And the sum,'' said Mlichael, `` is-how mucht''
]Fonr hundred and sixty-seven pounds,'' repliedi the man, `` with
some litle matter, not exceeding foir or five pounds more, for costs.''
]WYihdraw the arrest,'' said Michael, `and the money shall be
iinstanuly forthcoming.''

37o
THE LIPE ND ADYETtRES
 Let us see the money forthcoming,'' replied the fellow, grinning,
`` and the arrest shall be instantly withdrawvn,''
 Here is the money, sir,'' said Michael, taking out the pocket-book
contaiing MIartha's generous donation, and drawing from it notes to
the amount demanded.
 Then the business will be soon settled, young gentleman. May
I take the liberty to ask your name?''
` My name is of no consequence whateer, sir,'' replied Michael.
"But lose no time in giving me the discharge. Only first enter that
chamber with me once again, withdraw your companion from his
frightful watch, and tell the poor yeung lady that it is ovser.''
The man realily obeyed, and the mourning, but thankfl Martha
was once more left with her old servant, to watch beside her father's
corse.

TiE circumstances which immediately followed are not of sufficient
consequence to detain us long. Our old acquaintaince, MIr, Augustus,
now Major Dowling of the- regiment, quartered at the distance of
a day's journey, was sent for to get through the melancholy business
going on in his paternal mansion, as well as hc could; to give orders
respecting the funeral, and to make himself as thoroughly acquainted
with the real state of his family affairs as circumstances would permit.
Miichael, meanwhile, had taken leave of the weeping MIartha without
having given her the slightest hint as to the means by which Sir
Matthew's body had been releascd. Had he not known that the MIr.
Augustus, whose kicks and pinches he so well remembered, was ex-
pected to arrive for the protection of his sister, and of whatever pro-
perty they might still call their own, he would hardly have made up
his mind to leave her, however conscions he might have been of the
doubtful propriety of offering such protection as he could give. But it
was evident that the poeor girl thought he had better go, though it was
equally so that shc parted from him with thc greatest reluctance.
 You shall hcar from me,'' she said, '` my good Michael, and if
it should never be my good fortune to see yo more, remember me
with the same forgiving kindness that you have shown through all the
dreadful scenes you have witnessed here. You have a good and ge-
nerous heart, Mlichael, and though I know you suflered much by being

present at them, you will always like to rememher how greatly your
presence helped to support your carly friend in her great affliction''
lb3ut it was not destined that these sad scenes should be the last in
which Michael and his early friend were to be thrown together. In
little more than a week after the death of Sir Matthew, and while
Michael was still anxiously waiting at Fairly for such tidings from her
as might put him at liberty to set off without further delay for Nice,
 packet reached him from Dowling Lodge, containing two letters
One was from Martha, and contained these words:
Dear Michael,
IMy brother tells me that all of us, who are old enough, must
seek our own living, for that there is nothing left to support us. IMy-
self especially, he says, must, to use his own words, look about me
directly, as my behaviour to my family has never been such as to jus
tify my looking to any of them for assistance. This amounts to my
being actually turned out of doors, an exigency which at this moment
leaves me no other resource than what is afforded by the enclosed let-
ter. Read it, Michael, and let me know if you are willing to give
me your assistance and protection in reaching the amiable writer of it.
I could never have accepted, een for a day, the hospitality she so ge-
nerously offers, could I not prove to her, by bringing you with me, that
the sad subject which interrupted our friendship some seven or eight
yearas ago, could never again be a source of pain to either of us.
My dear father's last act towards me, which was, as I think I told
you, the placing a few hundred pounds in my hands for the exprcess
urpose of my lceaving the country, will enable me to undertake this
long journey without being a burden upon you, The green pocket-
ool, Michael, so well known to MIr. Parsons and Lady Clarissa, as
the repository of my fathers ready money, and sodisgracefully struggled
for during hislast moments, will prove of no value to its possessors be-
yond its morocco cover and its silken lining; for the notes which he
took from it to give to me, were the last he erer placed in it. My
messenger has orders to wait for your reply. If it will suit you im-
mediately to accompany me to Nice-my first stage shall be to the
little inn at Fairly, which you mentioned to me. I fear you will find
me a weak and troublesome traveller; but I think I have been im-
proving in health ever since I learnt that I had not your death to
answver for,
 Your grateful friend,
 Manru DowrIc,''
The other letter was from Miss Brotherton, and ran ths:
 Need I tcll you, my dearest Martha, with what feelings I reccivel
the news of your present pnainful position? Your father's marriage with
Lady Clarissa was, for your sake, a source of grceat sorrow to me, for
l was certain that your domestic happiness would be destroyed by it;
and this most unexpected event of your father's bankruptcy makes

me fcel quite sure that you have no longer a comfortable home in
England. Come then to me, my dear MIartha1 The painful estrange-
ment which grew between s, just when I was beginning to know and
value your excellent qualities, has long been a source of very painful
regret to me, because I am aware that I judged you unfairly, and
pronounced that judgment harshly. Be generous, theu, and prove
that you can forgive this, by immediately giving me the pleasure of re-
ceiving you as my guest. When we are together, we will consult about
what will be best for the future; but at any rate I have the satisfac-
tion of knowing that the climate to which I am inviting you is likely
to be beneficial to your health during the approaching winter: come
to me, then, ear friend, without delay. On the other side yaou will
find the route sketched that lI reeommend you for your journey. My
quarters are roomy enough to accommodate either man or maid-
servant, or both, if it will suit you to be so accompanicd.
Eer, my dear Mlartha,
'` Affectionately yours,
 ManY BnoruERTo.''
The consequence of this packet was another metamorphosis on the
part of MIichael, ` She shall not think,'' said he, addressiug MIr. Bell,
that my respect for her is lessened because her fortune has fallen.
I will wait upon her with faithfiul duty and most grateful affection:
but she was born in a palace, and I in a ceabin; and I will not, espe-
cially just now, obtrude myself upon her as a companion. As her
servant I hope l may be useful to her, and it is in that capacity that I
shall attend her,''
There was so much gool feeling shown in this project, that Mr. Bell
could not oppose it, whatever he might think of its necessity; and
MIichael, therefore, gave the astonished Martha the meeting at the
little inn she had named, in the character of a very neat and respect-
able-looking man-servant. Her faithful Betty Parker, who had con-
sented to be the companion of her journey, was in the room with her
when Michael made his appearance at the door, to receive her orders.
he cautious manner in which he made her comprehend his purpose,
and the nature of the office he had assumed, suggested to her the
propriety of not discussing it in the presence of the well-contented
Betty, who was excecdingly comforted by discovering that the young
man whom her mistress had informed her would travel with them, was
to do so as her fellow-servant, as she by no means felt herself capable
of becoming `` servant of all work'' to a young lady travelling through
foreign countries, of which she had never even heard the names. But
having contried to dismiss her female attendant on an errand, Martha
began to remonstrate with her faithful squire upon the great mistake
he had made in fancyig that she had ever thought of trarelling wvith
him in any other capacity than that of a friend. All she said, how-
ever, was in vain. Michael, though in a manner the most humbly
respectful, persisted in his purpose: and the almost destitute girl was
therefore constrained to set off upon her travels in a style which she
o MIIGIIAEL ARMSTONG.
a73
felt to be very unfitting to her situation. Her conscience, howcver,
could not rcproach her for this, for most assuredly she could not help it.
any were the letters, and various the mementos of affection,
intrusted by MIr. and Mrs. Rell to the care of Michael for their
dearly-beloved MIary Drotherton. Nor was there an individual of
whose welfare he thought it would plcase her to hcar, whom hc did
not visit to receive their loving blessings for the benefactress who, not-
withstanding hcr wide wanderings, hal never failed to remember the
wants of all wlo had faithfully served hcr, or in any way hecome
ependent on her bounty.
Ihese duties completed, and a farewell of most grateful affectiaon ut-
tered to the amiable clergyman and his cxcellent wife, Michael set off
pon his long journey with feclings of hope, joy, confidence, fear, diffi-
dencc, and trembling affection,-all so strongly mixed together in his
bosom that, had his life depended on it, he could not himself have told
which i was that most frequently preponderated. Yet, altogether, his
state of mind was very delightful: the novelty and excitement of jour-
neying, so pregnant of enjoyment to most of us, was most especially
captivating to him, whose education had been little more than the
nchecked developmcnt of imagination, and of that keen observation
of all surrounding objects which his shepherd life had taught him.
The first painful interruption to the state of felicity, arose from his
finding himself undcr the necessity of confessing to Martha that he
had no more money wherewith to pay their way. Aware that in the
perlormance of his self-appointcd ofice Michael would have to pay
every thing, and keep a regular account of it; and aware also that
the money he had receivel from her would enable him todo this,
without givsing him the additional trouble of daily scttlements with
her, she had merely said, a minute or two before they set of,  You
will be kind enough to be my banker, Mlichael, during the journey,
and wc will scttle accounts at the end of it,''
For just one weck from the day of their leaving Fairly, he was
able to do this; but then thc little remnant of his treasurc failed him,
and great as was his repugnanee to the measure, he was compelled by
dire necessity to confess that nearly the whole of her generous gift
adl gone to- ``io satisfy the rapacity of Mr. Parsons.''
It would be hardly possible for one human being to be more grate-
fnl to another than poor Martha felt to hcr young attcndant after this
disclosure. She rcmembhcred the agony which he had madc to ceasc:
she remembered, too, her state of utter incapacity even to compre-
hend, and still less to avert the horrors that surroundcd her; and,
spite of all Michael's respectful efforts to induce her to peror er
allotted character properly, she never from the hour of this disclosure
trcated him otherwise than as a dear and valued friend.
As their journcy approached its termination, howcver (to which
period Mlichael had looked with peculiar anxiety, as that most im-
portant to thc dignity of Martha), there was one argument, and ona
only, by which he was able to coax lier into lctting him make his first
appearance before Miss IBrotherton in the character of her servant;

TRE IFE AND ADvVENTURES
distracted eyes fixed themselves on the agitated face before him as if
they would read in it the history of yenrs.
 Edward -Teddy?'' cried Michael, opening his arms, and making
a step in advance.
In the next instant the brothers were locked in cach other's arms,
and Miss Brotherton drew back, and gazed upon them from a distance
as if the very ground that sustained hearts under the influenee of
such feelings was holy-while Fanny Fletcher, rose and sat down,
and rose again, checking the feeling that would have sent her t
stretch forth a hand of welcome to her old friend, by telling herself
that no hand, no voice but Edward's could be cared for then. And
perhaps she was right; for it is certain that for several minutes, neithes
Edward nor Michael were fully conscious whvre they were, nor who
they might be-that were near them. Once and again each beating heart
was strained against the brother heart, and then, their right hands
clasped, and the left placed, each on the other's shoulder,
tThey fell to such perusal of the face,''
that now, after eight cruel years of absence, was onee more beaming
with love and sympathy before their eyes, that it must have been a
very heartless and soulless being who should have come betwecn them.
Though such a history as Michael's might well have occupied more
than one long summer's day in the telling, to ears so greedy of every
circumstance connected with it as were those of Edward, yet it is won-
derful how very short a time sufficed to point out the keystone of the.
arch, upon which the whole wonderful fabric hung, and then it was that
Fanny Fletcher's voice was heard exclaiming in a burst of uncontrol-
lable emotion,
 Then it was I that caused it all. Oh1 Miss Brotherton, it wvas 1
who kept him in that horrid place for years1 Had I not told you he
was dead, it would have been hce who would havc been the happy ob-
ject of your bounty, instead of me: Oh1 how can he ever forgive
me e
This was uttered with such agitated rnpidity, that though there was
more than one present, who would hae been ready enough to contra-
dict the seif-accusing statement, shae gave them no time for it. IBut
it sufficel to draw Michael from the side of is brother, and to place
bim at hers: and thongh this terrible thought drew a shower of tears
from Fanny's eyes, notwithstanding the exceeding appiness which
was at the very same moment throbbing at her heart; it may be that
there eould not have been found a more effectual mode of at once
bringing back the long-parted Iriends to the same tone of familiar in-
tercourse in which they had parted, as this sincere self-recrimination
on oene part, and the warm pleading against its injustice, on the other.
For some minutes this lasted without being interrupted by a word
from any one; for both Mary and Edward found, sufficient occupation
in looking at them both, and then cxchanging expressive glances of
thanksgiving and happiness with cach other. But at length, pon
Fanny's saying with a fresh burst of tears,

Oh, Michael 1 Michael your eloquence is all in vain. You
will never, never teach me to torget that I have been cnjoying the
blessed destiny intended for you, aril that by nicans of words uttered
hy myselft'
Upon her saing this, thc happy Mary Brotherton pushed a low ta-
ouret before the reunited friends, and seating herself uon it, took
anuy's hand in lers, and said,  If you would not cry abont it, my
Fanny, I should think it was a mighty pretty exhibition of true feeling
and false argument that we were witnessing: but if you really intend
to bc unhappy, we shall all range oursclves imnediately on Michael's
side, and laugh you to scorn for your sophistry, and the deplorable
confusion you are making betwee cause and eflect. I should like to
know, little lady, how much it would have profited our Mlichael had
you refusel to answer when I inquired at the Deep Valley factory, if
you kncw aught abont him had you, while firmly believing he was
dead, declinel to state your belief, lest you might be mistaken, what
would i hase availel him, darling? Conld he have crept down be-
forc us from his sick bed to settle the qucstion? No, dear casuist
you know better. Your lookcs are much more wise than your words,
Fanny; for even no, though you pretend to shake your head, your
truth-tclling eyes confess that you hae not another syllablc to
say.''
 ut is it not sinogular,'' said Martha, who had been contemplating
the scene with unspeakable delight, '`is it not singular that Mlichael
should twice have been the victim of words, uttered by such very
friendly lipe?'
 Singular, dear Martha?'' repliel Mary; ``is not every 'event
connected with a hero of romanee, of necessity and by immutable
prescription, singular ? And whom did Fate and Fortune evier fix upon
more unmistakably to fill that distinguishel position in saciety, than
MIichael Armstrong? Wly are we all hecre together7 Wholly and
solely beeause hichael Armstrong saved Lady Clarissa Shrimpton
from the terrors inspired by a cow-is it not so, dear friends' Can
any of you dcny that all the exceeding happiness that blesses us at
this momcnt, has arisen from that most mnarvellously silly adventure ?
And shall we any of us qutarrel at the steps (though some of them it
must be confessed were rough cnough), which have led from that non-
sensical begiuning, to an end that has made us all so very hapy
Yes1 Michael Armstrong is a hero; ha is our hero; he is the crowning
blessing that is come to make us all thank Heaven for having brought
us every one from grcater and less degrees of misery, to very perfecet
pahpiness, and shall we not welcome bim with smiles, instead of tears,
Fanny ?''
Nothing could have been more admirably suited to the effcct which
the happy heiress meant to produce, than these vrds. How, aftcr
tbis, could Michael shrink, as he had expected to do, fom the humi-.
liating comparison between Edwvard and Fanny, with imself? O
how could Fanny persist in weeping, when her on heart, as well as
those of all around her, was so cheecriogly callel upon to rejoice?
Nothing of the sort was any longer thought of by either.

How very aodd,'' murmured the old lady, drawing her knitting
from her bag.
It is very odd, MIrs. Tremlett, rery odd inleed,'' said MIary,
there is no denying it. But the fact is, that Mr. Armstrong has
taken such an extraordinary fancy to this yeung man, that I really
think I shall be obliged to ask him to live with us. There will be
plenty of room, you know, in my Rhenish castle,''
The old lady said not a word in reply, but she looked puzzled, and
vexed, and shook her head, as much as to say that it was not like her
young mistress to talk such nonsense as that. So in her own defence
Mary was obligel to explain the mystery, and as happy an old woman
was nurse Tremlett, as she looked and listenel, as ever tasted joy from
the contemplation of it in others.

cocLLSI1ON,
D LLIorrL as was this state of mind to all that shared it, it could
not last. Michael was too much in earnest in his dread of being a
burden npon Miss Brotherton to permit many days to pass before he
hegged her to let him converse with her for a few moments in private;
and Mary, who had already seen quite enough to convince her that
the affection which Michael and Fanny had conceived for each other,
amidst the dreary misery of the Deep Valley Mill, was not likely to
be forgotten in the gay happiness of Nice, fully anticipated an humble
confession, on the part of Michael, that he could not be happy without
her permission to become the acknowledged lover of her charming
friend and protegee, and very amiable, frank, and noble-minded, did
she ceonsider it in him, thus openly to avow the truth at once. bBut
nothing could be further from the thoughts of Michael than making
any sueh confession as this; which, it ntay be observed, is by no
means saying that his heart was either innocent or unconscious of the
presumptuous passion she attributed to it.
Greatly, however, lid Mliss Brotherton underrate the young man's
character when she conceived that he gracious favour with which she
had receied him, could generate in his heart a wish to ask for
Ore.
It is taking a great liberty, madam,'' began Michael.
If you love me, do not call me mnadam, my denr Michael,'' she
repliel.  Do you not perceive that lward and Fanny both call me
s80

MIary? and till I had taught them to do so lI never could feel that they
quite understood the true spirit of my attachment towards them, or
the mode and manner of existence which I have imagined for myself,
and which must have fallen to the ground, if I had found them in-
capable of being to me, or letting me be to them, all that I wished and
desired. ou must not, dearest Michael, come and shaske this per-
fect and delightful union, introducing forms and ceremonies forcign to
our manners, and onr feelings. Pray do not look so grave, denr
friend2 Promise to offend thus no more, and I will cease to scold
you,'
Dearest Miss Brotherton 1'' said Michael. But this did not satisfy
the eigeane lady, who shook her head, and held up her finger inre-
proof.  Dearest Mary hen -'' he resumed, colouring brighutly,
and with a smile that made her think she could trace a family likeness
to IEdward, ' the greatest wish I have on earth is to become such as
you might approve, and if 1 shrink from the dear and precious fami-
liarity which must make Elward and Fanny so happy, think not that
lI am incapable of loving you as erfectly as they do; but remember,
dearest lady that however humble their origin, the very circumstance
of their having been your honoured companions for years, is of itself
sufficient to raise them to such a tone of thinking and of manners, as
may, in some sort, justify their using the privilege you so graciously
afford. But, alas: You must know too wvell that the case is far
different with me. The overflowving joy of our first meeting, naturally
broke dowvn, as it were, all inequalities, all boundaries, and I certainly
felt, and perhaps spoke, as if 1 too were one of the accomplished little
circle that might call this earthly paradise their lome. But reflection
will come, most generous Mar 1 if not amidst the happy intoxicating
moments of the day, it will make itself n voice in the quiet reasoning
meditations of the night, and so loudly has this voice been heard
by me, that lI cannot--no, in spite of nll the happiness that sur-
rounds me, lI cannot live on thus, an idle, ignorant dependant on
your bounty.''
The heiress wsas half vexed, but more than half plensel by this
trembling address, the deep sincerity of which wss testiiel y the
working features of a countenance more than commonly expressive of
all that passed within. She had enjoyed so much genuine happiness
since the arrival of Michael, and had watched with pleasure so ex-
quisite the happiness of Edward and Fanny, that she almost trembled
at the idea of any change: yet she knew the boy was right; she knew
that he ought to apply himself immediately and strenuously to such
studies as were most necessary for the redeeming the time he had lost,
and so well aware was she of this, that, notwithstanding her unwill-
igness to part with him, she rejoiced heartily to find that she] was
Wrong as to the subject on which she had suspected he wished to speak.
IHiad shc been right in her conjecture, all she could have done would
have been to endow the boy and girl with such a portion of her wenlth
as might have sufficed to make them independent; but uner such

crcumstances, all notion of essential improvement must of course be
abandoned for ever, and for many reasons this would hae been a
source of lasting regret to her. It was therefore with cordial appro-
bation that after the interval of a few moments, she replied,  MIicliael,
you are right. Nature has done so much for you, my dear friend,
that our wish to keep you constantly with us might easily, had you
shown less courage, have tempted us to fancy that you wanted nothing
which you have not got or which we could not give you. lBut you
are quite right in refusing to consent to this. We will immediately
return to Germany where you shall be placed at the same admirable
institution that so rapidly made your brother what you now see him.
Two years of well-lirected devotion to study, my der Michael, will
perhaps make you feel more at your ease among us, though I doubt,
if it can produce any change which will make us love you better.
 MIiss Brotherton  dearest Miss Brotherton I'' exclaimed Michael
-while perhaps the brightest beam of hope that ever yet shot from
hiis eyes, met hers as she affectionately gazed upon him, `' that was
not what I-what I dared venture to hope and ask for. What you
now propose, would be a happiness, the idea of which I think I should
have trned from, even in my dreams, from shame at its towering am-
ition. All I meant to ask was, your kind aid to place me in some
business where I might earn a maintenance, that in a year or twa
might prevent my being a burden to you-and now-''
 And now, Michael, I tell you fairly, that I have not the slightest
intention of doing any such thing. Desides my own particular ob-
jection to such a mode of proceeding, I hae lately heard a little
anecdote of you, from your friehd Martha, which makes it very
doubtful whether you deserve that species of independence-for she put
it in your possession once, you know-and you could not keep it. I
shall manage better, MIichael, depend upon it. One week more of
illeness in this sweet spot-and then we travel back to Germany.
Yon shall not be left to study in a more forsaken condition than was
your brother. We ghall be within an easy distance of you, my dear
Michael. One corner of my castle must hold us, while another i
beautified, and it is likely enough the work will go on all the etter for
our being there.''
``And your visit to Rome gien up for my sake?'' cried Michael.
 Oh? no, no, no I''
No, no, na, most certainly,'' replied Mary, laughing, ' I would
not give up that journey, Mlichael, for more than I will sy,
AII is not lost that is dtlaye.'
Instead of giving up the plan, I only mean to imprvove it. Tell
me, and tell me honesly, dear Michael, lo you not think in your hert
that we shall, one and all, enjoy this journey more if yon are with
us ?
Mary'' exclaimed the boy, wholly overcome, and seizing ane
kissing her hand with an emotion that at once and for ever banished
all resere, ` Mary1 it is your will to be loved, and who cain disobeyd

But my happiness seems greater than lI can hear? Whoere is Ed-
ward? Let me walk, and talk with him: He is usel to you, Mary,
and all this may not seem to him so very much like a tdream as it
does to me. If he tells me it is all real, I shall beliee it;'' and withs
these words, and his fine face glowing with all the best and happiest
feelings of our nature, hMlichael bounded from the presence of his
Denefactress to seek his brother.
I might have lied a good while in my fine house, at Millord, and
received a prodigious number of complimentary visits from my elegant
neighbours, before I should have enjoyed half an hour as I have done
this,'' thought the happy Mary Brotherton, as she strolled out through
an open window, that led to a little garden of orange-trees.   How
delicious is the air this morning'' But where was the climate, where,
at that moment, she would have felt it to be otherwise ?
Miehael had no difficulty in finding his brother, who in truth was
lingering near, on purpose to qutestion him after this interview.
 Come with me, lidward I'' eried the agitated boy, seizing his
arm; t here are our hats-come with me into thatlittle grove yonde
--my heart will burst if I do not instantly tell you what has passe.''
And arm-in-arm they crossed the road, and a small enclosre op-
posite, and there found themselves under the shelter of a little wood,
thick enough to exclude the peering eyes of mortals, as well as that of
the sun.
Notwithstanding their eagerness for the communieation which was
to follow, and which was pretty equally strong in both, not a word was
uttered by either till they reached this covert, and then, MIichael,
throwing himself upon a bank, and casting his hat away, clasped his
hands, and raising his eyes to heaven, exclaimed,  Edward, she is an
angel:
Edward had not followed his brother's example, in lying down, but
stood before him in act to listen. But there was something in these
words that seemed to shake im, for he turned away wihout answer-
ing
 Has she ever named to you her plans about me?'' resumcd Mi-
chael.
YesI' replia Edward.
 Then you know that it is not her intention to assist me, by en-
abling me to learn any trade in handicraft''
 No such idea, Michael, ever entered her head,'' said Edward,
gravely.
 But, my dear foellowl you seem to take all this so very coolly.
Do you know that it is her intention to send me to the same place
where your education was completel ?-bDo you know that she gives
up-no-that she postpones her journey to ltaly, till I am ready togo
with her ?-Edward, do you know all this?''
 MIy dear brother,'' repliel Edward,'' I only know, that from the
moment she learnt you were alive, she determined that she would im-
mediately make you perfectly independent, as she has done me. All
the rest, I think, depended upon your own inclination-and had she

not found you disposed for this scheme, she would not have insisted
pon it.'
 Disposed for it, Eiward? Oh1 what cold, what chilling words%
ou could not speak so, if you thought there were any hope of my so
profiting by it as to become a fit companion for you-for her-for
Fanny. kBut it is too late-you feel that it is too late-is it not so,
Edward:
 No, Michael, no1'' returned Edward, with sudden animation.
 With your faculties, your eager desire to learn, and the masters you
will hase to put you in the way of doing so, I ow that the result of
these two years of study vill be all you wish, and all your friends can
desire.''
t Then how can you receive this glorious nes, my Edward, so com-
posecdly?'
 First, dear MIichael, because it is no news to me. And secondly,
because I am a selfish wretch, and was thinking, perhaps, more of my
wn interest than of yours. Forgive me for it, my own dear Michael 1
But I would rather have had it decided that we should have both
marched off, and taken service under the Emperor of Austria. I
know that commissions would have been obtained for us,''
Michael, as his brother uttered these words, looked up into his facs
with an cxptression of such astonishment and dismay, that the blood
rushed to Edwards face and he turned away to conceal his con-
fusion.
 Eward1 you are a mystery to me,'' exclaimed Michael, spring-
ing pon his feet, and taking his brother by the arm. ` Can it be
possible that you are weary of the life you lead Oh, heaven: and
such a life
 Wcary? am I weary of it, Michael? eary of rising every day to
feel that I am a wretch unworthy to breathe the breath of life any
where? And ohl how utterly unworthy to breathe it here1''
It was now poor Michael's turn to change colour, and he did so
pretty violently-for first he became very red, and then exceedingly
pale. That Elward, such as he had ever remembered him, such as
he found him now, that he should so very solemnly declare himself to
be a wretch unworthy of life, was a horror and a misery as terrible as
it was unexpected. IIe had no power to utter any soothing in con-
iradiction to this appalling statement, for, alas it might be true-and
Michael's heart sunk within him as he remembered how totally ignorant
he was of every thing that might enable him to disbeliere it. Bilently
the brothers walked on for some paces, side by side. They were both
of them either unwilling, or unable to speak. At length a sort of shud-
dering emotion that passed through Michael's fame, made itself felt
bDy the arm of Edwvard, which he still held, and then he stoppel, and
without raising his eyes from the ground, said
 Michael1 How is it you understand me? Do you suppose that
I hae been guilty of some cciminal act, such as dooms man to the
gallows? Ifnot, why do you shudder thust''
384
rIE LIE AD ADvETnRES
 Wonld you not shudder, Edward, if you heard me say, that I
as a wretch unworthy to lite '
Poor Michael1 perhaps I might; but still I loubt if I should
understand the phrase as you do. It is so difficult, so impossible to
express temperately and soberly, my own reprobation of thc feelings
that destroy me: And yet, lear iMichael,'' he continued more tran-
quilly, : I could have fancied that there was something working in
your owvn heart which might have taught ou in some degrce to guess
the state of mine-I have no strength, no courage to enter on the
guilty subject fully-but-that you may not think me a felon, MIichael,
I will tell you in once audacious word, I ov, and that with a fervour,
a vehemence of passion, that often makes me tremble at myself-for
did it ever master me so far as to force a confession of it in the
presence of its object, I never could look up again, but must and
ould for ever become an alien from all I love, and a friendless wan--
derer on the face af the earth,.''
Though shocked more deeply than he had any wish or power to
express, Michael coull not resist the belief, which came with terrible
strength upon him, that his unhappy brother had conceived a passion
for some married woman, and that his hest chance of recovering hoth
his virtue and his tranquillity would he by following the wish he had
expressed, and by entering on a new and active carcer, to give himself
a chancee of obliterating from his mind the feelings wvhich had so un-
happily taken possession of it. Such a destination for Elward must ofl
course destroy some the very brightest of his awn beautiful day-dreams::
but there was a fund of integrity and real goodness in the heart ofi
Michael that permitted him not at that moment to think of himself.
t Elward 1'' suaid he solemnly,  if this be so, follow the course thatt
your better fcelings have suggested-adopt at once the profession of
a soldier. It has ever been accounted a noble one--thugh, under
happier circumstances-but that matters not-if your passions have
led you wsong, let your principles bring you back again. Confess the
truth to your generous benefactress at once,''
Michael l'' repliel Edward, looking in his face with an exprssion
of suffering that almost amounted to agony-``I would rather die]
firt.'' These words seemed intended to close the conversation, or at
any rate they did sao: for the two bhrothers silently retraced their
path to the house, and a fond pressure, expressive of love and pity,
whieh Michael gave to the ar of ward before he parted tom it,
was all that passed between them fnrther at that time.
The interview of that morning with Miss Brotherton had awakened in]
the mind of Michael, feelings towards her which an hour hefore hc]
would have thought it mst have taken years to produce; but being]
equally sincere, both in his former timidity and his present confidence]
he speedily made up his mind to open his heart to her, and do for hi:f
guilty, but suffering brother, what it was evident he had not courag]
to do for himself. In pursuance of this resolution, he again sough]
the heiress, and whispered in her ear, ` Mary 2-will you let me tall
to yau a little more?'' She eagerly conplied with the impliel ia]

vitation, and passing her arm through his, accompanied him to the
scene of their former tete--tite.
There was no shsyness on the part of Michael. The familiar ap-
pellation he had used was not assumed for the purpose of proving his
oledience, but resulted from a genuine feeling of afectionate con-
fidence in every word she had uttered, and which had left on his mind
the belief that she was not only his generous patroness, but his loving
friend.
I liutle thought when I was talking to you this morning about my
poor self,'' he said, `` that I should so soon have to take you away
again fom your drawing, to talk about Elward.''
Aout Ewarl?'' said Mary colouring, `i what do you wish to
say about him, dear Michael ?''
t It is something that he declares he would die rather than say to yo
imself,'' replied Michael, " but l am certain that yo ought to know
it, for it is quite clear that there is no chance of happiness for him
unless yo agree to his wishes.''
WVhat wishes?'' oxclaimed the heiress, terribly agitated, `` for
goodness sake, Michael, do not trifle with mel Did Eward commis-
sion you to speak to me?''
 OhI, nol had he felt courage to do that, I should have told him
nt once, that he hal better do it himself,'' replied Michael. `` Indeed
I fear greatly tht he will be displeascd with me; but I cannot benr
to see him so iserable without mentioning it to the only person
canable of helping hin,''
Miserable %?-Helping him ?--ell me, Michael, tell me at oncs
what you mean 1'
`That is exactly what I wish to do, denr Mary I'' replied Michael
looking with cousidernble surprise at her varying colour, and agitated
leatures;``but I fear 1 am doing wrong, and that I have already
said something that vexes you,''
No, no:'' cried MIary impatiently, `only, go on t'
 In onc word, then,'' resumed Michael, ``our dear Edwarl wishes
beyond all things to enter the Austrian service.''
 And leavse usI' returncd the eiress, almost gasping. `' Does
Edward want to leave me 2''
: Do not suspcct him of ingratitude, MaryI'' cried Michael, eagerly:
`there is a reason for it. and without thiis I am quite sure he would.
never think of such a thing.-Edward has conceived an unfortunat6
passion for an object from whom he ought to fly-and this, of course,
will explain every thing to you.''
Let me see himl Let me hear himt From himself, and from
himself only I can hcnr this. Let it mean what it may.'' On utter-
ing these words, which were spoken with a very agitated and untran-
quil air, Mary rotherton rushed out of the roomn, much to Mlichael's
ustonishment; for he could by no means comprehend why she should
testify such very strong emotion, especially as he had so cautiously and
delicately avoided hinting any thing about a married woman's being
unhappily the object of his brother's passion.

nE LIE AND ADENTUnES
In this ignorance or Michiel's, the reader, I am very sorry to sny,
must share. There are some facts which no wise historian will ever ven-
ture to dilate upon, lest their strangeness should provoke incredulity;
and great wisdom is shown by such forhearance; for it is infinitely better
that an enlightened pnblic should be driven to exclaim, ` IIow very
obscure this nassage is ?'' than  How very improballe ''
Michael Armstrong is the hero of the book that is now drawing ra-
pidly to its conclusion: and every reader has therefore a right to ex-
pect that his destiny shall be plainly announced to them, whatevet
mystery may hang over that of aothers. Whatever occurred between
the heiress and Edward in the conference which they speedily held
together, it did not cause any alteration in that lady's purpose of
immediately returning to her chateau pon the hine. A man of
worth and great ability was engaged to take charge of the richly
teeming eager ind of Michael, during the two years that it was
settled he should remain at a German university, and nothing could
he more satisfactory than the result of this arrangemcnt. Never,
perhaps, were tro years put to greater profit in the development of
mind, than upon this occasion: and when they were ended, Michael
Armstrong was able to take his station upon the beautiful terrace, with-
out feeling that he was out of his place there.
Less than these two years had sufficed to bring to perfection all
Mary Brotherton's plans for improving and eautifying her spacious
residence. It was one of those super-terranean quarries which are
somcetimes seen to spread themselves to such miraculous extent in that
region, and would have inspired most ladies with a feeling of dreary
vastness, which, notwithstanding the exeeeding beauty of its position,
would have prevented any hope of rendering it comfortably habitable.
But Mary had an ample heart, and an ample purse. Circumstances
over which (to use a thoroughly authorized expression) she hal no
control, for in truth they hd preceded her bhirth, had rendered he
own country less dear toe her than it is to most others; and she
therefore not only determined to plant herself elsewhere, but to do
so in such a manner as would enable her to make her new abode her
home, in the best sense of the word, and this could only be done by
giving
Ample raom, anl rerge enougl,''
to make it the home of others also. Any travellers lucky enough to
light upon this widely-spreading, but comfortable and thoroughly well
kept-up abode, will find that, notwithstanding its great extent, it has,
by no means, the air of being uninhabited. Nobody will be much
sutrprised to hear that Mlichael Armstrong and Fanny Fletcher heeame

nigh lcad to a more explicit dctail, there is really no roon left to cnter
pon it. All that can be said in addition to this is, that when Sir
Matthew Dowling's affairs came to he wound np, there was disceovered
to be a sufficient surplus to atfford a small independence to each of his
clildren, which, being ivided aecorling to the proportion dictatel by
the kniglt's will, gave something ayproaching to a benjamin's mess por-
tion to his daughter Martha. To claim and receive this, as well as oc-
casionally to visit some members of her family, Martha made frequent
excursions to England; but her happiest hours were those she passed
with her dear friends in Germany, by whom she is ever received with
open arns.
MIrs. Tremlett is still enjoying an old age of perfect comfort, cheered
by warm affection, and is already the darling of many little hearts.
There is no record to be found in any documents relating to the
inhabitants of the chateau, showing that Edward Armstrong ever
entered the Austrian service. It is, therefore, most reasonable to
suppose that this wish was never complied with.

oPINIONS OF TE PHRESS.
 Sir James Aiexander' Life af Wellington has the treble advantsge of heing the
chenpesl-of inserting a large portion of tle original correspondenea-and of con-
densing within popular limits ihe lry military etails''- Gtole
 can safely recommend his important and promising publication to our
enders.''-Naal aid Miliiary Gasette
 The sle and ell-saleeted arrngemen of the detailsof tlis valuable work are
in eery respect comensurate witl the worth of the noble and galiant ero of which
it teeats.''--MIarder,
 Ths work is likely to hae a predigios circulation. I1 ilI probably contsin the
most complete, correct, n suteutic deiails of the aventful life of this exalted here
profeund statesman, and patriotice alitieian,''-ath IIerald.
Sir James Alexsnder pessesses erery requisite for this great undertaking. elng
bimself a soldier, he can depict graplically tlie claness and chages aof thst Iifa of til
and danget, and in the technicnl letails of military enterptise he is of coure superir
to tle uniaitiated. Having had aceess to many exclusie sources of information, and
heing honeurei, as ve understnd, by perasonal interriess witl the nohlo Dke, wloss
MIemoirs le edits, we nturally conclude that is work will he peculiarly aractire.
Na loubt cun be entertaiced tat, wen cemleted, it will aobtin a pnrominent place in
tue lrary of those to wshose henrts tlei country's glory is denr, and be receisel as
 standard work in all miliary circles.''-Dublin Eteuing Paeket.
