indeed O

two B-CARDINAL

The O
first B-ORDINAL
was O
the O
Right O
Honourable O
Lady O

Shrimpton I-PERSON
  O
but O
this O
distinguished O

though.she O
drove O
only B-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
|
| O
pony O
instead O
of O
four B-CARDINAL
horses O
, O
was O
considered O
by O
all O
the O
country O
|
| O
round O
as O
the O
one B-CARDINAL
thing O
needful O
to O
render O
a O
party O
completely O
elegant O
. O
|
| O
She O
was O
, O
indeed O
, O
neither O
young O
, O
handsome O
, O
nor O
rich O
, O
but O
she O
was O
|
| O
Lady O
Clarissa B-PERSON
, O
and O
this O
was O
enough O
. O
|

| O
The O
other O
exception O
was O
to O
be O
found O
in O
the O
rotund O
person O
of O
Dr. O

Crockley O
, O
who O
having O
formerly O

a O

little O
fortune O

taken O
out O

had O
lately O
married O
a O
beauty O

and O
settled O
in O
the O
town O

where O
he O
was O
well O
pleased O
to O

| O
pick O
up O
a O
few O
guinea O
fees O
, O

as O
a O

real O

very O
tender O
passion O

buying O
finery O

‘ O
This O

was O
an O
especial O
favourite O
with O
Sir O

chiefly O
on O
account O
of O
his O
jocund O
humour O
and O
ready O
laugh O
  O
|
| O
and O
also O
, O
perhaps O
, O
because O
he O
had O
a O
pleasant O
way O
, O
peculiar O
to O
him- O

self O
, O
of O
paying O
compliments O

these O
distinguished O

, O
the O
dinner O
moved O
on O
very O
slowly O
. O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
, O
indeed O
, O
was O
|

as O
brilliant O
as O

who O
did O
not O
scruple O
to O
declare O
that O
she O

Was O
very O
partial O
to O
him O
, O

to O
all O

with O

much O

Dr. O

The O

of O
the O

as O
they O
panted O
round O

« O

his O

he O

as O
near O
to O
the O
ear O

from O

one O
  O

, O
despite O

all O
his O

could O
do O
to O
crush O
such O
an O
odious O
idea O

that O

In O

a O
good O

to O

Had O

Lady B-PERSON

found O
consolation O
in O
the O

fact O

that O

rarely O

been O
selected O

enviable O
situation O

principally O
from O
her O
appearance O

admirably O

But O
in O

a O

contrast O

Lady O

Lady O

‘ O

he O
exclaimed O
in O
an O
accent O
of O
great O
alarm O

— O

“ O

Sir O

here O
the O

its O
power O

quite O

extraordinary O
. O
” O
And O
as O
he O
spoke O

he O
whistled O
in O
a O
note O
which O
meant O

as O

“ O
If O

“ O

Obedient O
to O

true O

of O
the O

however O
, O
the O
dog O

forward O

there O
ensued O
the O
scene O

affected O
to O
spring O

at O
the O
nose O
of O
the O
cow O
, O
while O
she O
, O
somewhat O
accelerating O
her O
stately O

pace O
, O
threw O
up O

bent O
down O

her O
horns O

nearly O
touched O

no O

a O
succession O

The O

during O
this O
most O
delightful O
walk O

notwithstanding O
the O
homage O

paid O
to O
her O
rank O

with O
a O

she O
was O
in O
the O
habit O

meeting O

that O
their O

, O
after O
a O
peculiar O

theory O
of O
her O

the O
unfortunate O

been O
less O
surprised O
at O
the O
phenomena O

followed O

these O

it O

the O

of O

Considering O
that O
there O
had O
been O
nothing O
very O
affectionate O
in O

nature O
of O
the O
intercourse O
which O
had O
taken O

it O

was O
rather O
singular O
that O
the O
little O
Michael B-PERSON

feel O

sorry O

did O
at O

feel O
sorry O

when O
the O
door O
shut O

he O
turned O
away O

hid O

Pride O

, O
having O
been O
in O

con- O

siderable O

by O
Mrs. O

's O
energetic O
expression O

of O
her O
feelings O
, O
something O
like O
curiosity O
awoke O
within O
her O
to O
learn O

what O
the O
circumstances O
had O
been O
which O
had O
induced O
Sir O

Dowling I-PERSON
to O
declare O
an O
intention O

acting O
benevolently O

For O
a O

moment O
she O
struggled O
against O
it O
, O
and O
again O
seemed O
about O
to O
leave O
|
| O
the O
room O
  O
but O
as O
she O
tuned O
her O
eyes O
upon O
the O
child O
, O
she O
seemed O
|

to O
feel O
that O
before O
one O
so O
very O
abject O
, O
no O
loss O
of O
importance O
could O
be O

feared O
, O
even O
if O
she O
did O
question O
him O

So O
, O
with O
the O
air O
of O
a O
judge O

walking O
up O
to O
the O
bench O
, O
she O
stalked O
onwards O
to O
the O
seat O
Mr. O
Mac- B-PERSON

nab O
had O
left O

placing O
her O
austere O
person O
in O
it O
, O
made O
a O
signal O

with O
her O
hand O
, O
that O
the O
kitchen O
- O
maid O
who O
had O
ventured O
to O
approach O
|

the O
little O
boy O
should O
stand O
back O

her O
space O

examine O

On O
one B-CARDINAL
side O

stood O
the O
lordly O
butler O
, O
with O
his O
arms O

folded O
, O
and O
a O
look O
of O
scorn O
upon O
his O
countenance O
that O
seemed O
to O
|

question O
the O
propriety O
of O
the O
measure O
Mrs. O

ADVENTURES O

of O
this O
extraordinary O
scene O
, O

be O
punished O
with O
as O
little O
suffer- O
|
| O
ing O
as O
possible O
. O
Two B-CARDINAL
sprightly O
housemaids O
seemed O
to O
find O
some- O
|
| O
thing O
vastly O
amusing O
in O
the O
whole O
business O
, O
though O
their O
evident O
|
| O
merriment O
was O
restrained O
by O
the O
solemnity O
of O
Mrs. O
Thompson B-PERSON
’s O
|
| O
manner O
. O
|

| O
“ O
Look O
up O
in O
my O
face O
, O
little O
boy O
, O
” O
said O
the O
housekeeper O
, O
as O
soon O
|
| O
as O
she O
had O
seated O
herself O
and O
saw O
that O
those O
around O
her O
stood O
still O
, O
|
| O
as O
if O
they O
had O
taken O
their O
places O
, O
and O
were O
prepared O
to O
listen O
. O
|

| O
Michael B-PERSON
did O
not O
move O
  O
he O
was O
probably O
ashamed O
to O
show O
that O
|
| O
he O
was O
weeping O
, O
before O
the O
face O
of O
a O
lady O
who O
spoke O
so O
very O
|
| O
grandly O
. O
|

| O
‘ O
The O
kitchen O
- O
maid O
gave O
him O
a O
nudge O
, O
but O
a O
gentle O
one O
, O
whisper- O
|
| O
ing O
at O
the O
same O
time O
— O
Look O
up O
, O
my O
boy O

What O
be O
you O

Thus O
encouraged O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
let O
his O
arm O
drop O
by O
his O
side O
, O
and O
dis- O
|
| O
covered O
a O
face O
that O
was O
indeed O
sallow O
, O
and O
by O
no O
means O
very O

plunp O

“ O

deeply O

Then O

Michael B-PERSON
gave O
a O
little O
shake O
of O
the O
head O

seemed O
to O
the O

that O

she O
walked O

so O
little O

elated O
in O

so O
little O
thankful O
for O
the O
extraordinary O
change O

which O
had O
befallen O
him O

that O

have O
punished O
his O

by O
requesting O

turn O
him O
out O

again O
  O

rounding O
his O
young O
head O
, O
as O
she O
poetically O
expressed O
it O
, O
with O
a O
halo O

of O

| O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON

went O
to O
his O

also O
, O
hardly O
better O

pleased O
with O
what O
had O
occurred O
than O
’ O
little O
Michael B-PERSON
. O
But O
there O
|
| O
was O
this O
difference O
between O
them O
: O
little O
Michael B-PERSON
said O
his O
prayers O
, O
|
| O
which O
the O
great O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON
did O
not O
  O
but O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
spent O
his O
|
| O
Jast O
waking O
moment O
in O
cursing O
, O
with O
great O
fervour O
of O
spirit O
, O
the O
|
| O
folly O
of O
the O
hideous O
old O
maid O
, O
who O
had O
entailed O
such O
a O
detestable O
|
| O
burden O
upon O
him O
— O
the O
result O
of O
which O
, O
as O
a O
peace O
- O
offering O
to O
the O

| O
whole O
body O
of O
operatives O
, O
was O
at O
any O
rate O
but O
problematical O
. O
|

| O
Nevertheless O
, O
when O
he O
awoke O
the B-TIME
next I-TIME
morning I-TIME
with O
his O
head O
|
| O
quite O
cool O
, O
he O
felt O
disposed O
to O
think O
more O
of O
the O
hint O
given O
him O
by O
|
| O
his O
friend O
and O
favourite O
Dr. O
Crockley B-PERSON
, O
and O
less O
of O
the O
inconvenience O

of O
having O
a B-QUANTITY

pay O
out O

which O
, O
if O
well O

might O
help O

to O
avert O
a O
monstrous O

of O
mischief O

With O
these O
rational O
thoughts O
working O
strongly O
in O
his O
ever O

active O

he O
rang O

Sir O

its O

that O

Strange O
to O
say O

the O
only O
tie O
resembling O

prevented O

the O
total O
isolation O
of O
this O
poor O

it O

was O
a O

easy O
to O

In O
Sir O

it O
pro- O

, O

her O

“ O

” O
poor O
Martha B-PERSON

had O
a O
sweet O

voice O

The O

looked O
up O

with O
the O
weakness O
that O
appeared O
constitutionally O
peculiar O
to O
him O
, O
|
| O
his O
eyes O
were O
immediately O
filled O
with O

Yet O
Michael B-PERSON
was O
not O
a O

whimpering O

either O
  O
many O
had O
seen O
him O
harshly O

he O

had O
worked O
almost O
from O

nobody O

had O

But O
if O
his O

his O
poor O

his O

either O

it O
was O

“ O

first B-ORDINAL
clear O

Mrs. O

taste O

that O

never O

herself O
entirely O

was O
thought O

Mrs. O

together O

the O

grew O
tired O

ventured O

hint O

would O

himself O

, O
that O

The O

stationed O
within O

perform O
the O
office O

He O
bent O
low O
before O
the O

and O
low O
too O
before O
his O

the O
jocose O
visits O

the O

Neither O

Then O
followed O

, O
hating O
most O
cordially O
the O
bravery O

of O
the O

which O
made O
him O
expect O

Of O

the O

a O

at O

But O
the O
death O

the O

seemed O

more O

pos- O

sible O
that O
any O
act O
of O
hers O
could O
bring O
upon O
her O
a O
reprimand O

it O

would O
have O

something O

from O
what O
I O

should O
unhappily O

greater O

the O

From O
the O
moment O
the O

perceived O
that O
her O
beloved O

wilful O

was O
not O
only O
serious O

sorrowful O
, O
and O
that O
, O
too O
, O

concerning O
no O
imaginary O
grief O
, O
but O
from O
the O
contemplation O
of O
the O

truly O

her O
condition O

vanished O
  O
and O
yet O
nurse O
Tremlett B-PERSON
was O
perfectly O
capable O
of O

perceiving O
all O
the O
inconveniences O
likely O
to O

on O
both O
sides O
from O

so O
strange O
a O
scheme O

But O
even O
while O
such O
thoughts O
silently O
took O

possession O
of O
her O
, O
leaving O
perhaps O
some O
legible O
traces O
on O
her O

, O
her O
young O
mistress O
looked O
so O
kindly O
and O
so O
coaxingly O
in O

| O
her O
face O
, O
as O
if O
at O
once O
reading O
and O
deprecating O
all O
she O
had O
to O
say O
, O

that O
she O
felt O
nothing O
was O
left O

obedience O

A O
precaution O
by O
the O

following O
her O
instructions O

composed O

yet O
|

startling O
rhymes O

about B-CARDINAL
thirty I-CARDINAL

the O
most O
fervent O

now O
gracefully O

both O

the O

to O
make O

she O
produced O
an O
effect O

more O
easily O
imagined O
than O
described O

The O
speech O
which O
followed O
from O
Sir O

was O
very O
noble O
, O
and O

at O
once O
let O
the O

all O

The O

not O

in O
catching O

the O

was O
deafening O

Then O
came O
a O
very O
- O
striking O
’ O
scene O
indeed O
. O
Michael B-PERSON
appeared O

superbly O
dressed O
, O
and O
on O

holding O
lightly O

gracefully O
each O
a O
little O
basket O
, O
from O

under O
the O

of O

peeped O
out O
grapes O

on O
the O
one B-CARDINAL

something O
that O
had O
the O
semblance O
of O
a O
flask O
of O
wine O
on O
the O

other O
. O

Then O
spoke O
the O
fair O

Louisa B-PERSON

“ O

when O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
having O
received O
a O

in O

, O
appeared O

” O

Upon O
this O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
turned O
round O
again O
towards O
the O
audience O
, O
and O
|
| O
stood O
stock O
still O
. O
It O
was O
quite O
evident O
that O
he O
had O
some O
speech O
to O

make O
which O
he O
had O
apparently O
forgotten O
, O
for O
it O
was O
impossible O
for O

child O
to O
look O
more O
completely O
distressed O
and O
at O
a O
loss O

At O
length O
it O
became O
pretty O
evident O
that O
, O
in O
lieu O
of O
all O
other O
per- O
|
| O
formance O
, O
the O
poor O
boy O
was O
going O
to O
cry O
  O
and O
some O
ingenious O
per- O
|
| O
sons O
doubted O
whether O
it O
might O
not O
be O
in O
his O
part O
to O
do O
so O
  O
but O
this O
|
| O
idea O
was O
speedily O
removed O
by O
the O
very O
matter O
- O
of O
- O
fact O
pokes O
and O
|
| O
nudges O
which O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
young O
ladies O
bestowed O
upon O
him O

In O
addition O

to O
this O
it O
seemed O
as O
if O
the O
little O
fellow O
caught O
some O
stimulating O
sounds O

from O
the O
coulisses O
, O
for O
he O
cast O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
furtive O
glance O
in O
that O

direction O
, O
and O
at O
length O
, O
with O
what O
was O
evidently O
a O
great O
effort O
, O
he O
|

stammered O
out O
, O
|

“ O

The O

were O
so O
completely O
choked O
by O
the O

all O
his O

not O

retired O

She O
laid O
her O

deliberately O
determined O
not O

close O

eyes O
in O

till O
she O
had O

made O
up O

mind O
as O
to O
the O
best O
way O
of O
rescuing O
the O
pale O

child O

The O
question O
was O
not O
altogether O
an O
easy O
one O
. O
She O
could O
hardly O
|
| O
doubt O
that O
very O
strong O
indignation O
would O
follow O
any O
open O
effort O
on O
|
| O
her O
part O
to O
interfere O
with O
a O
child O
publicly O
held O
up O
as O
the O
favoured O
|

object O
of O
Sir O

loudly O
- O
vaunted O
benevolence O
, O

moreover O
, O

privately O
marked O
out O
by O
his O
vindictive O
nature O
as O
a O
victim O
to O
his O

hatred O

Whether O
as O

in O

munificence O
, O
or O
a O
champion O
against O
his O
|
| O
hate O
, O
it O
was O
pretty O
certain O
that O
her O
interference O
would O
render O
her O
|
| O
obnoxious O
to O
her O
pompous O
neighbour O
's O
displeasure O
, O
and O
this O
she O
had O
|
| O
no O
inclination O
to O
encounter O
if O
she O
could O
help O
it O
. O
For O
though O
at O
this O

moment O
she O
felt O
within O
her O
a O
strength O
and O
firmness O
of O
purpose O
not O
|
| O
easily O
shaken O
, O
the O
poor O
girl O
knew O
that O
she O
stood O
alone O
in O
the O
world O
, O
|
| O
with O
no O
friend O
to O
support O
her O
more O
powerful O
than O
nurse O
Tremlett B-PERSON
, O
and O
|
| O
nothing O

her O

in O
many O

that O
she O
feared O
might O
turn O
out O
rather O
difficult O
to O

So O
she O
determined O
to O
avoid O
quarrelling O
with O
Sir O

Dowling I-PERSON
|

as O
long O
as O

pleaded O
for O

absolutely O
haunted O

she O
determined O
upon O

being O
cautious O
, O
wise O
, O
and O
very O
deliberative O
in O
any O
measures O
she O
might O
|
| O
eventually O
take O
to O
ensure O
his O
release O
. O

Under O
the O
influence O
of O
these O
prudential O
resolutions O
, O
Miss O
Bro- O
|

for O
the O

abandoned O

with O

determined O
to O
find O
her O
way O
to O
the O

| O
cottage O
of O
his O
mother O
instead O
. O
Yet O
even O
this O
she O
felt O
must O
be O
done O

with O
caution O

Her O

was O
wholly O
from O

For O

herself O
she O
believed O
the O

she O
was O

However O
much O

Nevertheless O
, O
before O

half B-QUANTITY

had O

seen O
on O

it O
is O
probable O

| O
that O
before O
reaching O

she O
would O
have O
been O
surrounded O
by O

a O
body O

So O
greatly O
did O
this O
danger O
appal O
her O

spirits O
, O
that O
the O
first B-ORDINAL

gloved O
hand O
either O
at O
one B-CARDINAL
window O

the O
other O

she O
stopped O
the O
car- O
|
| O
riage O
, O
and O
ordered O
the O
coachman O
to O
go O
far O
enough O
down O
the O
lane O
|
| O
to O
permit O
her O
to O
get O
out O
unobserved O
by O
any O
persons O
passing O
by O
the O

poor O

this B-DATE

disappointment O

indignant O
, O
and O
almost O
passionate O
beating O
of O
her O
heart O
under O
it O

made O

her O
more O
conscious O
, O
perhaps O
, O
than O
she O
had O
ever O

“ O

Mary B-PERSON

at O
the O

The O

relieved O

She O

Sir O

indulged O

several B-TIME

very O
deep O

At O

the O

it O
seemed O

It O
was O
the O
lively O
Peggy B-PERSON

answered O
the O
summons O
  O

though O
she O

entered O
almost O
out O

from O
the O

traversed O

led O

disappointed O

all O

said O
about O

  O

the O
command O

had O

was O
too O
peremptory O

trifled O

she O
very O

nearly O
slammed O

A O

More O
convinced O

But O
, O
indeed O
, O
my O

I O
greatly O
fear O

that O

what O

for O
he O
is O
like O
a O

to O
them O
all O

he O
promised O

any O

So O
now O
, O
I O
have O
written O

him O
about O
this O

he O
has O
answered O

as O
possible O

only O
he O
tells O
me O
that O

got O
such O

from O

that O

when O

he O
ca O
n’t O
keep O

that O
he O
must O
have O
yes O

no O

I O
am O
afraid O

therefore O

Sir O

with O
an O
appealing O

Her O

a O
moment O
before O

suddenly O

she O
was O
about O

repeat O
again O

ere O

she O
so O

“ O

Mrs. O

gazing O

with O
an O
expression O

countenance O

appeared O

to O
both O

The O
poor O

ill O
, O
and O
the O
first B-ORDINAL

, O
that O

when O

the O

Martha B-PERSON

liked O

the O

Tate B-PERSON
painful O
scene O

, O
moreover O
, O

at O
this O

joyfully O
recollected O
how O
charming O
an O
anecdote O

had O
now O
to O
relate O
concerning O
her O

acquiesced O
in O
this O

a O

herself O
beneath O

sheltering O

extensive O

ascertained O

looking O
round O

that O

really O
alone O

passing O
her O

Instead O

giving O
a O
direct O
answer O
, O
Martha B-PERSON
eagerly O
exclaimed O
, O
“ O
I O

am O
so O
glad O

all O
that O

do O
assure O
you O

that O

what O
you O

papa O
has O

been O
, O
and O
still O
is O
, O
most O
excessively O
kind O
to O
hii O

Only O
he O
was O
very O

troublesome O
about O
the O
acting O
, O
and O
papa O
’s O
temper O
is O
hasty O
. O
That O
, O
as O
|
| O
a O
must O
be O
aware O
, O
Miss B-PERSON
Brotherton I-PERSON
, O
is O
the O
case O
with O
many O
people O
  O
|

| O
wut O
there O
are O
very O
few O
who O
have O
courage O
and O
candour O
to O
own O
it O
, O
as O
|
| O
my O
father O
does O
. O
In O
justice O
to O
him O
, O
I O
must O
tell O
you O
what O
happened O
the O
|
| O
morning B-TIME
after O
the O
unfortunate O
play O
. O
My O
father O
sent O
for O
me O
, O
and O
|
| O
said O
, O
that O
he O
was O
perfectly O
miserable O
in O
his O
mind O
on O
account O
of O
the O
|
| O
anger O
he O
had O
shown O
towards O
Michael B-PERSON
. O
He O
told O
me O
, O
as O
frankly O
as O
|
| O
possible O
, O
that O
he O
had O
beat O
him O
, O
and O
that O
in O
consequence O
of O
this O
, O
the O
|
| O
boy O
was O
evidently O
so O
afraid O
of O
him O
that O
he O
had O
no O
enjoyment O
when O
in O
|
| O
his O
presence O
. O
And O
he O
went O
on O
to O
say O
that O
such O
being O
the O
case O
, O
he O
|
| O
was O
determined O
to O
apprentice O
the O
child O
to O
a O
good O
trade O
, O
where O
he O
|
| O
might O
learn O
to O
maintain O
himself O
comfortably O
, O
and O
assist O
his O
family O
be- O

sides O
. O
So O
you O
see O
, O
Miss B-PERSON
Brotherton I-PERSON
, O
” O
concluded O
Martha B-PERSON
, O
in O
an O
eager O
|
| O
voice O
, O
and O
with O
heightened O
colour O
, O
“ O
you O
see O
that O
if O
papa O
loses O
his O

temper O
, O
he O
knows O
how O
to O
atone O
for O
it O

Miss O

listened O
to O
this O
statement O
with O
the O
most O
unbroken O

attention O

had O
she O
not O
been O
previously O
aware O
of O
the O
kind O

| O
excellent O
nature O
of O
Martha B-PERSON
Dowling I-PERSON
, O
she O
would O
have O
become O
so O
then O
, O

Her O
hopes O
, O
too O
, O
that O
all O
was O
fair O

right O

strengthened O
  O
and O
in O
full O
confidence O
of O
receiving O

a O
satisfactory O
answer O
, O
she O
said O
, O
“ O
I O
am O
very O
much O
obliged O

Nevertheless O
, O
when O

he O

paused O
for O
a O

obeyed O
the O
orders O
of O
Parsons O
to O

“ O

That O
its O

It O
was O
with O
so O
bustling O

movement O

that O
the O
landlady O

back O

the O
little O
round O

became O

The O
farmer O
quietly O
- O

pushed O
back O
his O
chair O
, O
to O
follow O
the O
table O
, O
the O
young O
woman O
modestly O

squeezed O
herself O
very O
closely O
into O
the O
chimney O

corner O
, O
and O
her O
brother O

fairly O
bolted O

with O
eyes O

widely O
opened O

it O
had O
been O
his O
chance O

Mr. O

looked O
neither O
to O

to O
the O

made O
himself O
comfortable O
without O

sidering O
whether O
any O

not O

Michael B-PERSON

crept O
in O
after O
him O
, O
and O
when O
the O
more O
important O
part O
of O
the O
company O

| O
had O
arranged O
themselves O
, O
he O
was O
observed O
standing O
alone O
in O
the O
most O
|
| O
distant O
part O
of O
the O
room O
. O
|

| O
“ O
What O
dost O
stand O
shivering O
there O
for O
, O
my O
boy O
? O
” O
said O
the O
old O
|
| O
farmer O
, O
in O
north O
- O
country O
dialect O
, O
so O
broad O
as O
to O
be O
dangerous O
for O
|
| O
south O
- O
country O
folks O
to O
spell O
, O
“ O
I O
could O
be O
after O
thinking O
there O
was O
|
| O
some O
mistake O
here O
. O
Surely O
you O
ought O
not O
to O
be O
standing O
, O
while O
some O
|
| O
other O
folks O
are O
sitting O

This O
observation O

though O
the O
genuine O
result O
of O
the O
old O

notions O

reverse O

might O
not O
have O
been O
so O
bluntly O
spoken O
, O

had O
he O
not O

himself O

by O
the O
unceremonious O

in O
which O

his O

Michael B-PERSON
probably O

did O
not O
understand O
the O
full O
meaning O
of O
the O
remark O
, O
nevertheless O
he O

looked O
dreadfully O
terrified O
, O
and O
fixed O
his O
eyes O
upon O
the O
back O

Mr. O

This O

On O

nearer O

came O
at O
every O

to O
the O
object O

he O
most O
hated O
to O
look O
upon O

But O
then O
came O
also O
the O
cheering O
thought O

that O
he O
was O
no O
longer O
a O
mere O
factory O

but O
about O
to O
become O

apprentice O

a O
good O

profitable O
trade O

in O

hereafter O
he O
might O

get O
money O
enough O
for O
himself O

Nevertheless O
, O
he O
certainly O
did O
wish O
, O
at O
the O
very O
bottom O
of O
his O
heart O
, O
|

that O
the O
stocking O

was O
not O
carried O
on O

tothe O

at O

the O

knew O
not O
what O
was O

him O
  O
the O
influence O
under O
which O
he O
cowered O
thus O
, O
was O
like O
that O
pro- O

duced O
by O
the O
leaden O
dimness O
of O
a O

A O
long O

either O
by O

Michael B-PERSON
heard O
the O

close O
, O

looked O
up O
. O
The O
room O
he O
was O
in O
|
| O
was O
so O
long O
as O
almost O
to O
appear O
like O
a O
gallery O
, O
and O
from O
one B-CARDINAL
end O
to O
|
| O
the O
other O
of O
it O
a O
narrow O

out O
, O

for O

about B-CARDINAL
two I-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
to O
sit O
down O
at O
once O
. O
The O
whole O
of O
this O

was O

now O
occupied O
by O
a O
portion O
of O

have O
wrung O
the O
heart O

any O

who O
looked O
upon O
them O
, O
however O
|
| O
blessedly O
wide O
his O
own O
destiny O
might O
lead O
him O
from O
the O
melancholy O

troop O
. O
- O
But O
to O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
the O
spectacle O
was O
appalling O
  O
and O
, O
young O
as O
|
| O
he O
was O
, O
he O
seemed O

the O
filthy O

half B-CARDINAL

starved O
wretches O
before O

him O
, O
were O
so O
many O
ghostly O
representations O
of O
what O
he O
was O
himself O
|

tobe O
. O
A O
sickness O
like O
that O
of O
death O
came O
over O
him O
, O
and O
he O
would O
|
| O
have O
given O
a O
limb O
, O
only O
for O
freedom O
to O
stretch O
himself O
down O
upon O

no O

But O
the O
master O
of O
the O

at O
this O
feast O

of O
misery O
bore O
a O
huge O

his O

without O
which O
indeed O

it O

he O
seldom O
appeared O
on O

with O
it O
an O
eye O
that O

the O
power O
of O
quelling O

a O
single O

The O

again O

no O

be O

lost O

getting O

I O
knew O
that O

were O
likely O

Ashleigh B-PERSON

in O
a B-DATE
day I-DATE
or O
two B-CARDINAL

I O
wished O

possible O

to O
avoid O

the O
trouble O

of O
sending O

it O
unfortunately O
hap- O

pened O
, O
that O
my O
man O

Parsons B-PERSON

obeyed O
this O

much O
more O
literally O

I O
intended O

for O
meeting O

named O

him O
the O
very O
next B-DATE

he O
immediately O
mentioned O
the O
circumstance O

them O

finding O
that O
they O
had O
a O
comfortable O
van O

every O
thing O

convenient O
with O
them O

the O
whole O
business O
was O
arranged O

done O

before O
I O
returned O
from O
a O
visit O
I O
had O
been O
making O
at O
Netherby B-GPE
. O
This O
|
| O
was O
certainly O
being O
more O
prompt O
than O
was O
necessary O
, O
but O
it O
would O

have O
mattered O
little O

comparatively O
speaking O

had O
he O
not O
been O
such O
a O

goose O
as O
to O
let O
the O

off O

without O
even O
asking O
to O
which O
of O
the O

it O

For O
a O
moment O
, O
this O
opinion O
brought O
some O
consolation O
with O
it O
, O
simply O

from O
the O
decision O

the O

all O

again O

she O
felt O
that O
there O
was O
, O
perhaps O
, O

something O
improbable O

exaggerated O
in O
the O

A O
little O
further O

it O

not O

when O

it O
was O
in O
a O
voice O
that O

hardly O
exceeded O

Yet O

this O

some O
young O

ears O
again O
caught O
words O

Yet O
still O
the O

worked O

on O
, O

nothing O

to O
mark O
that O
any O

more O

By O

forth O

they O
knew O
that O
the O
grave O

yawned O
before O

Then O
it O
wasthat O
the O
ghastly O
countenances O
of O

each O
doomed O

struck O
dismay O

even O
before O

an O

to O
which O
reluctant O
decision O
two B-CARDINAL
reasons O

strongly O
contributed O
. O
The O
first B-ORDINAL
was O
, O
that O
though O
with O
his O
usual O
fore- O
|
| O
thought O
he O
had O
divided O
his O
nocturnal O
buryings O
between O
the O
churchyards O
|
| O
of O
Tugswell B-PERSON
and O
Meddington B-ORG
, O
the O
clergymen O
of O
both O
had O
declared O
that O
|
| O
their O
frequency O
rendered O
it O
necessary O
that O
some O
inquiry O
should O
be O
made O
|
| O
into O
the O
cause O
of O
so O
great O
a O
mortality O
— O
and O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
was O
that O
the O
|
| O
fact O
of O
the O
mistress O
of O
the O
apprentice O
house O
, O
being O
herself O
at O
the O
point O
|
| O
of O
death O
from O
the O
same O
malady O
, O
must O
infallibly O
prove O
to O
the O
medical O
|
| O
visitant O
that O
it O
was O
no O
treatment O
peculiar O
to O
the O
children O
which O
had O
oc- O
|
| O
casioned O
it O
, O
but O
that O
it O
had O
come O
beyond O
all O
possibility O
of O
contradiction O
|
| O
by O
the O
visitation O
of O
God O
. O
|

| O
Nevertheless O
the O
medical O
gentleman O
ventured O
to O
declare O
that O
nothing O
|
| O
would O
be O
so O
likely O
to O
stop O
the O
contagion O
as O
nourishing O
food O
  O
upon O
|
| O
which O
the O
terrified O
manufacturer O
astonished O
all O
the O
butchers O
within O
his O
|
| O
reach O
, O
by O
commanding O
a O
large O
supply O
of O
beef O
and O
mutton O
“ O
good O

enough O
to O
make O

” O
and O
before O

had O
|

passed O
away O
, O
the O
wisdom O

this O

when O

Mr. O

" O
It O

all O
hope O

then O
, O
poor O

Now O

, O
indeed O

I O
listened O

she O
smiled O

first B-ORDINAL

sighed O

as O
she O
thought O
of O
the O

useless O
activity O

which O

It O
would O

in O

little O
that O

Even O
the O

of O

to O
which O
she O
had O
before O

great O
delight O
, O
now O

recurred O
to O

to O
bring O
the O
recollection O
that O

For O

her O

urged O
her O
not O

Not O
only O

was O
it O
pale O

in O
addition O
to O
her O
usual O

shy O

manner O
there O
was O
an O
appearance O
of O
uneasiness O

almost O
of O
fear O

for O

no O

As O
he O
spoke O
these O

, O
Sir O

rose O
from O
the O

, O
as O
if O
to O

accelerate O
the O
movement O
which O
was O
to O
send O
her O
off O

| O
Martha B-PERSON
listened O
to O
him O
with O
the O
habitual O
reverence O
which O
she O
ever O

bestowed O
on O
all O
he O

shook O
her O
head O

it O
seemed O

“ O

nothing O

cried O
Lady B-PERSON
Dowling I-PERSON
, O
suddenly O
rousing O
herself O

from O
the O
dignified O
apathy O
in O
which O
she O
usually O
indulged O
. O

« O
What O
a O
shame O

” O
cried O
one B-CARDINAL
sister O

“ O
That O

too O
bad O

cried O
the O
other O

« O
Just O

sneered O
Mr. O

. O
|

| O
“ O
Hold O
your O
tongues O
, O
all O
of O

said O
Sir O

urged O

thus O
goaded O
to O
the O
interview O
she O
dreaded O
, O
Martha B-PERSON

hastened O
to O
leave O
the O
room O
  O
but O
ere O
she O
passed O
the O
door O
, O
something O
at O
|

her O
heart O
told O
her O
that O
her O
best O
course O
would O
be O
to O
take O
her O
father O

apart O
, O

tell O
him O
all O

She O
turned O
back O
to O
look O
at O
him O
, O
but O
met O
a O

frown O
so O
strongly O
indicative O
of O
growing O
impatience O
at O
her O
delay O

that O

yielding O
to O
the O
sort O
of O
slavish O
feeling O
in O
which O
she O
had O
been O
nurtured O
, O

she O
hurried O
forward O
to O
obey O
him O

Had O
she O
possessed O
greater O
moral O

courage O

many O
subsequent O

gave O
the O

assurance O

adding O
an O
earnest O
injunction O
that O

should O
keep O

the O
necessity O

seemed O
to O
vanish O
before O

the O
powerful O

thus O
offered O

and O
she O
left O
her O
little O

comforted O

invigorated O
by O
the O
belief O
that O
he O

great O
duty O
to O

that O

during O
the O

journey O
were O
very O
simple O
, O
but O
they O
puzzled O
her O
maid O
considerably O
. O
|
| O
First B-ORDINAL
, O
it O
was O
so O
very O
odd O
that O
she O
should O
be O
going O
out O
upon O
a O
visit O
and O
|
| O
take O
absolutely O
no O
dinner O
dresses O
at O
all O
with O
her O
  O
and O
secondly B-ORDINAL
, O
it O
was O
, O
|
| O
if O
possible O
, O
odder O
still O
, O
that O
she O
should O
not O
take O
her O
. O
But O
Mary B-PERSON
listened O
|
| O
to O
all O
the O
hints O
and O
innuendoes O
to O
which O
these O
feelings O
gave O
rise O
with O
a O
|
| O
sort O
of O
gentle O
indifference O
, O
which O
was O
doubtless O
very O
provoking O
, O
till O
at O
|
| O
length O
she O
was O
induced O
to O
damp O
the O
curiosity O
, O
which O
she O
feared O
might O
|
| O
prove O
inconveniently O
active O
during O
her O
absence O
, O
by O
saying O
, O
“ O

|

to O

family O
of O

I O

This O
was O
perfectly O
satisfactory O

unceremonious O

of O
Mrs. O

the O

overcame O

“ O

the O

of O

looked O

This O
was O

at O
once O

ing O
the O

on O

an O
effect O
very O

different O
from O
what O
he O
intended O

|

| O
That O
Fanny B-PERSON

should O
tremble O
at O
the O
mention O

not O
extraordinary O

that O
Mary B-PERSON
should O
hear O
again O
, O
in O
fancy O
, O
the O
|

grating O
sound O
of O
the O
locks O

had O
closed O

doomed O
to O
remain O
in O
that O
hateful O
spot O
against O
her O

, O
|
| O
showed O
that O
her O
nerves O
had O
indeed O
been O
severely O
shaken O

that O
her O

Mrs. O

again O

in O

Mr. O

something O

drawing O
out O

such O
cheerful O

him O

Mr. O

took O
the O

it O

with O
a O
rather O
surly O
inclination O

pocketed O

Mary B-PERSON
looked O
in O
his O

, O
and O
the O
sort O
of O
half B-CARDINAL
- O
ashamed O
glance O
with O

| O
which O
the O
extortioner O
watched O
the O
effect O
of O
his O
words O
, O
appeared O
to O
her O

so O
sinister O
, O
that O
with O
a O
sudden O
feeling O
of O
something O

she O
remembered'that O

she O
said O

at O

the O

time O
drawing O
out O
again O
her O
almost O
empty O

Woodcomb B-PERSON

keeping O
his O

, O

furtively O
directed O
towards O
Mrs. O

at O

placing O
her O

“ O
That O

with O
an O
air O

tone O
of O
the O
most O
amiable O

at O

the O
same O
time O
stretching O
out O
his O
hand O
, O
in O
which O
he O
received O
the O
entire O

contents O

uncounted O

of O
Mrs O

Tremlett B-PERSON

Miss B-PERSON

the O

enclosed O
them O

emptying O
their O
two B-CARDINAL

before O
his O

eyes O

He O
now O
moved O
forward O
of O
his O
own O
accord O
, O
drew O
forth O
from O
the O

pocket O
of O
his O
coat O
the O
massive O
key O
, O
applied O
it O
with O

strong O

effective O

The O

heard O

very O

in O

that O
each O

Mary B-PERSON
felt O
disposed O
to O
bound O
along O
the O
grassy O
path O
beside O
the O
stream O

with O
the O
joyous O
playfulness O
of O
a O
child O
, O

rather O
than O

re O

entered O

that O
creaking O

chance O
of O
finding O
quarters O

less O
hateful O
beneath O
its O
rippling O
wave O
. O
Mrs. O
Tremlett B-PERSON
breathed O
more O
|
| O
freely O
, O
and O
seemed O
to O
have O
recovered O
the O
elastic O
step O
of O
youth O
, O
as O
she O
|
| O
moved O
briskly O
on O
. O
But O
compared O
with O
what O
was O
passing O
in O
the O
breast O
|
| O
of O
the O
ragged O
, O
dirty O
little O
creature O
that O
walked O
beside O
them O
, O
their O
|
| O
feelings O
were O
most O
earthly O
cold O
and O
dull O
. O
Her O
small O
hand O
was O
still O
|
| O
clasped O
in O
that O
of O
Miss B-PERSON
Brotherton I-PERSON
, O
who O
felt O
that O
the O
child O
was O
urging O

her O
onward O
, O
even O
faster O
than O
she O
was O
inclined O
to O
go O
, O
while O
her O
head O
|
| O
upturned O
towards O
the O
towering O
heights O
which O
hemmed O
them O
in O
, O
|
| O
seemed O
eagerly O
seeking O
an O
outlet O
from O
the O
region O
that O
her O
soul O
ab- O
|
| O
horred O
. O

“ O

ated O
hand O

The O

stopped O
short O
in O
her O
hurried O

walk O
, O
and O
looking O
up O
in O
her O
deliverer O

face O
, O
with O
a O
doubting O
anxious O

look O
that O
it O
was O
painful O
to O
see O

very O
softly O

as O
if O

replied O
the O
child O
. O
“ O
I O

dreamed O

“ O

Mary B-PERSON

‘ O
Run O
on O

fine O
large O

You O

never O
saw O
such O
a O

The O
little O
girl O
sprang O
forward O
, O
and O
falling O
upon O
her O
knees O
on O
the O
|
| O
grass O
, O
plucked O
the O
tall O
flower O
, O
and O
pressed O
it O
to O
her O
lips O
, O
and O
to O
her O
|
| O
heart O
. O
But O
though O
this O
was O
a O
childish O
action O
, O
it O
was O
not O
done O
child- O
|

ishly O
: O
there O
was O
an O
appearance O
of O
deep O
feeling O
, O
and O
even O
of O
devotion O
|
| O
in O
her O
look O
and O
attitude O
which O
strongly O
awakened O
Mary B-PERSON
’s O
interest O
, O
and O
|
| O
when O
the O
little O
creature O
rose O
again O
, O
and O
holding O
the O
flower O
in O
one O
hand O
, O

| O
slid O
the O
other O
once O
more O
into O
that O
of O
her O
new O

the O
heart O
of O
that O

friend O
yearned O
towards O
her O
with O
newly O

awakened O
tenderness O

But O

when O
she O
spoke O
to O
her O

endeavoured O
to O
lead O
her O
into O
conversation O
, O

the O
attempt O
entirely O
failed O

‘ O
There O

many O
who O

of O

Fanny B-PERSON
’s O
little O
fingers O
upon O
her O

sometimes O
caught O
her O
looking O

up O

as O

by O

  O
‘ O

With O

Mrs. O

the O

she O
exerted O

herself O
to O

“ O
My O

looking O
at O

great O
anxiety O

‘ O
‘ O

able O

? O
” O

“ O
It O
is O
only O
because O
I O
have O
not O
been O

“ O
thatis O

not O

we O

Our O
work O
keeps O

us O
always O
on O
our O
legs O

and O
that O
makes O
them O
bend O
about O
so O
, O
when O
I O

try O
to O
walk O
  O
but O
I O
can O
walk O
though O
it O
hurts O
me O
, O
and O
I O
think O
it O
would O

be O
better O
to O
die O
outright O
in O
getting O
on O

rather O

And O
again O
the O

the O
difficulty O
with O
which O
the O

Fanny B-PERSON
got O
along O
became O
more O
obvious O
at O

it O
soon O

The O
dilemma O
was O
not O
a O
pleasant O
one O
. O
They O
were O
still O
in O
a O
part O
of O
the O

toad O
so O
little O
frequented O

that O
it O

either O

Mrs. O

The O
distress O
of O
the O
little O

was O
painful O
to O
witness O
. O
At O
the O
very O

moment O
when O
the O
dark O
cloud O
which O
had O
seemed O
to O
settle O
upon O
her O

was O
withdrawn O
, O
and O
hope O
gradually O

with O
difficulty O
, O
as O
to O
eyes O
long O

unaccustomed O

its O

began O

reach O
her O
  O
at O
that O
very O

her O

strength O
failed O
, O
and O
a O
sensation O
, O
like O
the O
sickness O

rendered O

every O

“ O

morning O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
found O
herself O
on O
a O

without O

amidst O
the O
long O
parched O
grass O

and O
frequent O
stones O
with O
which O
it O
was O
covered O

“ O
This O

stopping O
short O
  O
“ O
I O

And O
having O
so O
decided O

she O
turned O
about O

it O
, O
a O
sort O

hillock O
at O
a O
little O

aside O

Her O
approach O

was O
from O

a O
dazzling O
sunset O
was O
in O
her O

as O
she O
made O
her O
way O
up O
the O
rugged O
side O

what O
looked O
like O
one B-CARDINAL

by O

looked O
down O

The O
fragment O
of O
a O
hat O

and O
the O
remnant O

a O

evidently O

Pital O

feverish O
were O
the O
transitions O

at O
this O

he O

that O
the O

it O

feeble O

sure O

nature O
meant O
him O
not O

long O
against O
the O

misery O
of O
his O

and O
there O
were O
moments O
in O
which O
this O

even O

him O

“ O

‘ O

then O
again O

the O
fact O
was O
completely O
ascertained O
and O
known O
to O
nearly O
every O
inmate O

of O

Mr. O

then O
been O
married O
about O

three B-DATE

, O
was O
in O
appearance O
the O
very O
reverse O
of O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
being O
as O
|

remarkably O
small O
, O
as O
the O
other O
was O
large O

But O
what O
she O
wanted O
in O

muscle O
, O
was O
made O
up O
in O
watchfulness O
, O
Nothing O
escaped O
her O
restless O

and O
malignant O
little O
eyes O
, O
and O
either O
from O
the O
incessant O
danger O
of O
her O

sent O
suffering O
worse O
than O
every O
other O

there O
were O
many O
who O
declared O

they O
would O
be O
glad O
to O
have O
her O
brutal O
predecessor O
back O
again O

It O

was O
this O
woman O
who O
first B-ORDINAL
descried O
the O
absence O
of O
Michael B-PERSON
from O

“ O

No O
one O
could O
answer O
  O
and O
No O

sought O
for O

“ O

proclaimed O
the O
active O

intelligent O
Mrs. O

, O
after O
discovering O
that O

“ O
Off O

her O
husband O
  O
‘ O

you O

And O
so O
intruththere B-ORG
were O
. O
A O
continuous O
track O
of O
footmarks O
, O
were O
|

easily O
traced O
from O
the O
door O
to O
the O
steep O
bank O
behind O
the O
factory O
, O
|

where O
they O
were O
lost O
in O
the O
covert O
of O
bushes O
, O
which O
had O
of O
late B-DATE
years I-DATE

been O
coaxed O
to O
clothe O
its O
sides O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
furnishing O
fagots O

|
| O
That O
some O
one O
had O
recently O
broken O
through O
these O
bushes O
was O
equally O

evident O
, O
from O
many O
boughs O
having O
been O
torn O
, O
and O
the O
soil O
beneath O

them O
trampled O

This O
was O
enough O
to O
direct O
the O
pursuit O
, O
with O
so O
thuch O

| O
certainty O
of O
being O
right O
, O
that O
Mr. O

laughed O

the O

There O

only O

The O
worst O
misfortune O
is O
, O
that O

” O

Two B-CARDINAL
stout O

started O
accordingly O
upon O
the O
track O
thus O
easily O

hit O
upon O
, O
and O
Mr O

Woodcomb B-PERSON
awaited O
the O
result O
of O
their O
exertions O

without O
the O
slightest O
anxiety O
, O
or O
any O
irritation O
of O
nerves O
whatever O
  O
|
| O
albeit O
he O
knew O
that O
, O
favourite O
as O
he O
was O
, O
he O
might O
run O
no O
small O
risk O
of O

losing O
his O
place O
, O
should O
one O
of O
the O
apprentices O
really O
escape O
— O
but O
the O
|
| O
thing O
was O
impossible O
  O
no O

live O
without O

has O
never O
missed O
school O

, O
after O
what O
you O
said O
to O
him O
about O
exerting O
himself O
. O
I O
saw O
how O

he O
took O
it O
  O

, O
therefore O
, O
you O
may O
depend O

it O

that O

just O
think O

something O
holy O

imposing O
in O
the O

It O
would O

the O
boudoir O
of O

would O

the O

his O
pale O

parting O

throwing O

The O

No O
symptom O
of O
pursuit O
, O

alarmed O
him O

From O
the O
moment O

he O
quitted O
the O

, O
to O
that O
when O
he O

once O
been O
his O

mother O

, O
no O
terror O

  O

All O
he O

  O

all O

turned O
out O

As O
Michael B-PERSON
drew O
near O

every O

met O

that O
he O

It O
was O
a O
tremendous O
moment O
for O
him O
, O
that O
in O
whieh O
he O
first B-ORDINAL
caught O
|
| O
sight O
of O
the O
lowly O
door O
through O
which O
he O
had O
passed O
a B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
times O
|
| O
in O
eager O
anticipation O
of O
his O
mother O

Some B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
followed O
be- O
|
| O
fore O
he O
could O
reach O
it O
, O
and O
the O
boy O
trembled O
so O
violently O
that O
he O
tot- O
|
| O
tered O
as O
he O
hurried O
onward O
, O
like O
a O
drunken O
man O
. O
|

| O
At O
length O
his O
hand O
was O
on O
the O
latch O
  O
it O
yielded O
as O
in O
days B-DATE

, O

and O
in O
an O
instant O
the O
door O
was O
wide O

before O
him O
. O
Poor O
Michael B-PERSON
! O
|
| O
what O
death O
can O
have O
a O
pang O
so O
bitter O
as O
that O
he O
felt O
, O
when O
the O
almost O
|
| O
impossible O
project O
of O
reaching O
his O
mother O
’s O
home O
being O
performed O
, O
he O
|
| O
found O
that O
home O
empty O
and O
desolate O
, O
and O
telling O
him O
as O
plainly O
as O
|

angels O
trumpet O
- O
tongued O
could O
do O
, O
that O
she O
was O
dead O
! O
|

| O
A O
dismal O
groan O
burst O
from O
him O
, O
and O
he O
sunk O
on O
the O
floor O
, O
just O
where O
|
| O
he O
had O
last O
stood O
gaily O
talking O
to O
her O
of O
his O
bright O

for O
the O

, O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
hours I-TIME
before O
he O
was O
snatched O
away O
from O
her O
for O
ever O
. O
|

| O
The O
noise O
he O
made O
reached O
the O
ears O
of O
a O
woman O
in O
the O
front O
room O
, O
|
| O
and O
she O
opened O
the O
door O
of O
communication O
to O
ascertain O
who O
it O
could O
|

be O
, O

in O
the O

that O
was O

“ O

He O
literally O
hugged O

himself O

blessed O
the O
freedom O

the O

his O
very O

with O
gratitude O
for O
the O

he O
blessed O
God O
aloud O

But O
as O
he O

perceived O
the O

slowly O

thought O
upon O
the O

them O
, O
he O
almost O
repented O
of O
his O
selfish O
joy O

blamed O
the O
ecstasy O

Nor O
was O
he O
now O
quite O
free O
from O

feeling O

at O

meeting O
the O

felt O

the O
curious O
temerity O
which O

it O
was O

“ O

knitting O
his O

colouring O
from O
the O
unusual O
consciousness O
of O

deceit O

from O

Parsons O
looked O

replied O

blushing O
again O

thus O
unceremoniously O

At O
the O
great O
assembling O

he O
feared O

  O
the O
only O
human O

themselves O
at O
the O
most O

rather O

therefore O
, O
arose O
to O

check O
the O

this O

out O

upon O

The O
very O
sight O
of O
the O

along O

the O

From O

Michael B-PERSON

in O

questioning O
of O

he O
found O

himself O
  O
but O
for O
the O

were O
too O
intent O

ob- O

of O
their O
expedition O
, O
to O
converse O
idly O
respecting O

and O
by O
degrees O
|
| O
our O

grew O
as O
silent O
as O
the O
rest O
, O
and O
trudged O
on O
without O
any O
other O

communion O
than O
that O
of O
his O

considerable O
importance O

Michael B-PERSON
, O
must O
be O
detailed O
somewhat O
at O

the O
largest O

had O
an O
air O
of O
pretension O
and O

costliness O
about O
it O
, O
that O
caused O
the O
great O

to O

on O

without O

But O
Michael B-PERSON
was O
much O
exhausted O
, O
and O
having O

when O
passing O

mourned O

How O
the O

Michael B-PERSON
trembled O

took O

Miss O

off O

now O

this O

even O

something O

there O

traces O

“ O
Here O

large O
sum O

I O
believe O

She O
did O

not O
rightly O
know O
how O
much O
it O
was O
herself O
, O
she O
told O

, O
because O

she O
had O
kept O
on O
putting O
by O
what O
she O
did O
not O
want O
, O
and O
had O
never O

counted O
how O
much O
it O
came O
to O

and O
I O
’m O
sure O
I O
have O
not O
counted O
it O

either O
  O
but O
whether O
it O
is O
little O

much O
, O
I O
do O

Mr. O

smiled O
at O
the O
unusual O
manner O
in O
which O
the O

carelessly O

packed O

passed O

to O
the O

other O
. O
Before O
he O
examined O
the O
contents O
he O
questioned O
Michael B-PERSON
as O
to O
|
| O
all O
that O
the O
generous O
- O

girl O
had O
said O
to O
him O
, O
on O

it O
, O
|
| O
and O
the O
young O
man O
’s O
faithful O
answers O
soon O
convinced O
him O
that O
there O
|
| O
would O
be O
little O
kindness O
to O
the O
self O
- O
reproaching O
Martha B-PERSON
in O
refusing.a O
|
| O
donation O
which O
she O
evidently O
considered O
as O
an O
atonement O
, O
and O
which O

would O
, O
he O
doubted O
not O
, O
by O
its O
application O
to O

, O
do O

more O
towards O

“ O

Mr. O

, O
after O

hearing O
his O

“ O

Mr. O

then O
opened O
the O

found O

a O

, O

to O

appeared O
so O

he O
uttered O
something O

“ O
Poor O

sad O
indeed O

cried O
Mr. O

ever O

you O
must O
go O

you O

that O
the O
poor O

ever O

the O
doctor O

his O

Of O

I O
suppose O
it O
would O
not O

very O
convenient O
to O

for O

these O

I O
am O
sorry O

always O
insist O

which O
is O
a O
cruel O

so O
it O
is O
, O

therefore O
it O

all O

Mrs O

she O

to O

down O

Dr. O

applauded O
a O
great O

joked O
a O
little O
, O
and O
finally O
felt O
the O
patient O

pulse O
, O
observing O
at O

the O
same O
time O
that O
it O
was O
necessary O
at O
any O
rate O
to O
bring O
him O
round O

sufficiently O
to O
get O
a O
little O
talk O
on O

sagaciously B-PERSON

observed O

But O
you O

and O

| O
here O
she O
whispered O
something O
, O
that O
it O
was O
especially O
intended O
Martha B-PERSON

| O
should O
be O
neither O
the O
better O
nor O
the O
worse O
for O

The O
doctor O
nodded O

and O
winked O
, O
and O
nodded O
again O
  O

then O
turning O
to O
the O
poor O

who O
was O
not O

the O

Dr. O

to O

with O
very O
little O
of O
even O
the O
external O
|

decency O
of O
sympathy O
said O

Without O

Martha B-PERSON

not O
conceiving O

For O

Dr. O

Upon O
perceiving O
the O
totally O
unconscious O
state O
into O
which O
Sir O
Matthew B-PERSON

had O
fallen O

Michael B-PERSON

gently O
withdrawn O

now O
stood O

Never O

the O
poor O
depeidant O

had O
the O
young O
heart O
of O

been O
impressed O
with O
a O
feeling O

of O
respect O
so O
profound O
as O
he O
at O
that O

felt O
for O
the O
unhappy O

In O
truth O
the O
feeling O
was O
so O
powerful O
as O
to O
interfere O
with O
his O
usefulness O

he O
shrank O
from O

, O
after O
remaining O

bash~ O

fully O
silent O
for O
a B-DATE
quarter I-DATE
of I-DATE
an I-DATE
hour I-DATE
, O
he O
perceived O
that O
she O
gave O
no O

other O
sign O
of O
life O
than O
by O
tears O
that O
flowed O
incessantly O
, O
and O
sighs O
that O
|

seemed O
to O
heave O
her O
breast O
“ O
almost O
to O
bursting,”—when O
he O
saw O
this O
, O
|
| O
he O
began O
to O
think O
that O
some O
degree O
of O
seeming O
presumption O
on O
his O
|
| O
part O
might O
be O
better O
and O
more O
profitable O
for O
her O
, O
whom O
he O
would O
|
| O
really O
have O
died O
to O
serve O
, O
than O
the O
continuance O
of O
a O
degree O
of O
defer O

ence O
, O
which O
must O
render O
him O
useless O
. O
Approaching O
, O
therefore O
, O
to O
the O
|
| O
chair O
on O
which O
she O
had O
thrown O
herself O
, O
he O
ventured O
to O
say O
, O
“ O

her O
very O
well O
— O
she O
used O
to O
be O
always O
in O
the O

Poor O
Martha B-PERSON
for O
a O
moment O
ceased O
to O
weep O
, O
and O
looked O
up O
at O
him O
. O

“ O

” O
she O
replied O

But O
Michael B-PERSON
, O

unskilful O

Betty B-PERSON
Parker I-PERSON
knew O
little O
of O
the O
intensity O
of O
Martha B-PERSON
’s O
pertinacious O
|

love O
for O
her O
unworthy O
parent O
, O
if O
she O
fancied O
that O
her O
very O
reasonable O
|

remonstrance O
would O
produce O
any O
effect O
. O
Martha B-PERSON
attempted O
not O
even O

to O
answer O
it O
, O
but O
placing O
herself O
in O
a O
chair O
close O
beside O
the O

, O

remained O
nearly O
as O
motionless O
as O
the O
faintly O

figure O
that O
lay O

Poor O
Michael B-PERSON
knew O
not O
too O
well O
what O
he O
ought O
todo O
next O

He O
|
| O
felt O
that O
he O
was O
useless O
there O
  O
he O
knew O
that O
he O
should O
be O
stared O
at O
, O
as O

a O
very O
incomprehensible O
intruder O
, O
if O
he.descended O
to O
the O
offices O

Yet O
|
| O
he O
remembered O
that O
his O
benefactress O
had O
bid O
him O
not O
to O
go O
, O
and O
he O

could O
not O
have O
felt O
himself O
more O
strongly O
bound O
to O
remain O

the O

crime O
of O
high O
treason O
been O
involved O
in O
his O
departure O

Yet O
there O
was O
|

something O
in O
the O
stupid O
puzzled O
look O
with O
which O
Betty B-PERSON
Parker I-PERSON
regarded O
|
| O
him O
, O
that O
vexed O
his O
spirit O

He O
was O
conscious O
that O
he O
had O
no O
business O

in O
that O
room O

and O
therefore O
at O
such O
a O

not O

After O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME

of O
reflection O

approached O

so O
profound O
a O
reverence O
as O
to O
convince O

that O

him O

who O
he O

very O

much O
good O

his O

the O
nature O

Martha B-PERSON

began O
to O
remonstrate O
with O

faithful O

upon O
the O
great O
mistake O

The O
first B-ORDINAL
painful O
interruption O
to O

arose O
from O

confessing O

aware O
also O
that O

the O
money O

received O
from O

would O
enable O
him O

do O
this O

without O
giving O
him O
the O
additional O
trouble O
of O
daily B-DATE

her O

the O

great O

looking O

no O

Miss O

two B-CARDINAL
at O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
quite O
as O
earnestly O
as O
Michael B-PERSON
looked O
at O
Edward B-PERSON
, O
she O
|
| O
sprung O
from O
the O
sofa O
, O
pushed O
the O
table O
that O
stood O
before O
it O
with O
such O

violence O
from O
her O

nearly O
to O
overset O
it O
, O
and O
rushing O
forward O
laid O
her O
|

hand O
upon O
his O
arm O
, O
exclaiming O
, O
‘ O

On O
hearing O
these O
words O
in O
a O
voice O
unusually O
loud O
and O
agitated O
, O
|
| O
Edward B-PERSON
rose O
hastily O
from O
his O
seat O
, O
and O
approached O
Miss B-PERSON
Brotherton I-PERSON
|

as O
if O
to O
protect O
her O
from O
some O
threatened O
danger O
  O
but O
turning O
towards O
|
| O
him O
, O
she O
held O
up O
her O
hand O
as O
if O
to O
prevent O
his O
hostile O
approach O
, O
and O
|
| O
said O
, O
“ O

Thus O
addressed O
, O
Edward B-PERSON
did O
look O
at O
his O

for O
a O
moment O

with O
a O
countenance O

but O
suddenly O
Michael B-PERSON
smiled O
at O
him O
as O
he O
caught O
